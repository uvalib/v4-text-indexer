      <field name="fulltext">TO MY HONOVRABLE FRIEND, Sir Edward Dimmock Knight, the most worthy and generous Champion vnto the Sacred Maiestie of Great Britaine, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[That we no Gold nor Siluer doe thee send] That we no Gold nor Siluer doe thee send, Twas for thy sake (kinde Stella) courteous Friend. Who great things giue, doe looke for great againe, Our trifling toyes shall ease thee of that paine. TO THE IVDICIOVS VNDERSTANDER: To the Ignorant Reader: and to the base Carper whatsoeuer. Learned) to you, whose true Gentilitie Is match't with Vertue in Affinitie, Into whose fluent Vaine, the Muses nine Distill all Knowledge, Humane and Diuine, Who haue the gifts of Tongues to vnderstand, (Pure Linguists right) the state of euery Land: Whose Eglets Spirits to mount on high are found, And not as fearefull Swallow, lowe on ground: Whose boundlesse Ocean of Intelligence, Containes (of Artes) the subtile Quintessence. Your curteous Nature, being so sweetly fram'd, As it commends, what's worthier to be blam'd: To you alone, and vnto none but you, I offer vp my Selfe, and Booke, as due. As for that golden Skonse with leaden VVit, I scorne, for scorne, doth Ignorance best fit. Rich dunghill Midas with his Asses eares, VVho (with his Heeles) not with Discretion heares: The perfum'd gilt-Spurre Muske-Cat, Valours shame, Who is not (as he counterfeits) the same: Wearing a siluer Sword for fashion sake, And yet disgracefull Blowes and words will take: Whose Speech and Ruffe seeme Both, as One to be, Of the new Set, (Twins in Formalitie,) Where, if you barre him from his Common places, He is tongue-tide then, for therein his chiefe grace is, Whose Apish Trickes and Nods, with ducking low, The perfect Type of Vanitie doth show, Whilst (capring for the nonce) his Coyne must ijngle, His sole Attendance being his loathsome Ingle: Thinking he should be prays'd for his pyde Cloathes, (For he no better parts (than these are) showes:) All such, I barre, and banish from my Booke, Lest they profane it with vnhallowed Looke. Their musty Scoffes I bandy them againe, As strucken Ball flyes backe from whence it came. These wry-mouth'd Curs that barke, but dare not bite; (Their Mothers (but not Fathers) Children right;) Ile scourge from hence, and gaule them to the quicke, Whilst on themselues, not me, they poison spit. But vnto you (Iudicious) all Respect, Ass to the Scoffers Hate and base Neglect: Nor (if they are marryed) doe I wish them worse, Then to be plagu'd with Iealovsies blacke Curse. And he that (causelesse) with my Booke findes fault, I will maintaine with Vulcans Crest doth halt; Iudge (mildely) with sober Discretion then, So shall you be like Angels, and not Men. R. T. To the Jealous Husband, vpon this Translation by his kinde Friend M?. R. T. Thou that beleeu'st no Female Virtue, Thou Which so good lookes, and such false loue canst show (Enough for fashion) but still doubt'st thy friend, Least to thy choisest Piece he make his end. Vnhappy soule! that to what's Good art blind, That alwayes seekst, what thou fearst most to find. That runst before thy Faire one in the street, So, with foule mouths, that thy sly ears may meet, Such as dare black the name of Goodnesse, such As n'ere speake true but when they say, 'ts too much, Thou shouldst enioy what Fortune, not thy worth Hath giu'n tbee in her. Thou that ne're go'st forth But with a longing to heare what they talk Of Euphys, Sophron, if they chance but walk, Through thy faind kindnesse, to thy fairest home, And then art gal'd to heare some fained dome Which may concerne thy forehead, that's most free For them to philip, who most like thee bee; That's such as know nor Virtue, neither can Nor wish to know; that haue the name of Man Only because they Prate, or Get, or Tell The fortune of their Voiage, buy and sell; Can only these, and Fashion; or for worse, If any be, then hee that's only Purse. And, were not Basenesse by hir virtue scornd, Lord how securely, Dyszel, thou'dst be hornd. Thou that to The God of Cuckolds Rablais in Hist. Pantagruel lib. 3. chap. 33. Coquage sacrificest, when The Calender of Gods was made, mongst men Coquage was occupi'd, while Ioue assign'd To all the other Gods what speciall kind Of Sacrifices, and what Place, what Day Their Tides should be on; none but he away No room in Heauen left him; Ioue's Decree Was that he should with Goddesse Iealousie Partake in Tide, but that, on Earth alone, (Excluded Heauen) his Dominion Should be mongst those whose liberty was lost By Female vnion, but of all, those most Which blest were with the Fayrest, yet of them Onely o're such as sacrific'd to him With feare, suspicion, searching, spyes and doubt. None should his Godlike presence Grace without Such daily rites; no fauour, help, or aid, To any from him, while those dues vnpaid. But, as an Appanage, his Deity Should to the Iealous still companion be. Thou that vnable fram'st thy policy Gainst the Braguettes, and with Treachery Vainly resists what the sweet sex would doe With him they call on, great Much worship't in Sheeland, and his Castle Chappel, or Shrine is the Braguettes. S? Balletrou. Thou that deserust it, nor hadst so long mist What thou so seekst for, if a Spagirist Could saue hir Honors indiuiduall part, Yet giue the blow, thou knowst, would neuer smart. You that are n'ere at rest but when you wear Hans Caruel's Ring. Thou eldest Child of Fear, That of thy Madnesse first by Varchi done See here made ours, to vs our Friend alone Is as first Avthor. His desert must haue What Censure to first Authors euer gaue. Il Incognito. The Censure of a Friend, vpon this Translation, done by R. T. Gentleman. VVhat of this Booke the best Wits censure will, My reach of apprehension hath not skill To presuppose. The reason's ordinary: Because mens Iudgements with their Mindes doe vary: And for th' opinion of the Vulgar kinde, (My selfe being one) they sure are of my minde, Who, if my sense makes not my censure erre, This subiect doth on each degree conferre A benefit. The Iealous here may view, (As in a Glasse) what of himselfe is true. The Man or Wife from this pollution free, (For detestation thereof) here may see, The substance and successe of Iealousie. Vnmarryed Youth (of eythe sexe) are here Prescrib'd a Caution, and a course to cleare Themselues of this. The auncient may collect Prime Principles to dispossesse Suspect, Not ouer-growne in any hee or shee, Discouering but th'Effects of Iealousie. Thus haue I th'Information of my wit, And shallow Iudgement spent in prayse of it, Which here my Friend translates: if more be fit In laud of him (so that with truth't agrees) Thankes to the Writer, more then I, hee sees. Anth. Mar. To his Friend M?. R. T. vpon the Translation of this Worke. So many write: some for the fame of Prayse, And some their empty houres to entertaine: That Bookes are held but in these later dayes, Th' abortiue Issue of an idle Braine. And hence proceedes the generall disesteeme, The great Neglect of Learning and of Wit; When men proue not in action what they seeme, But write their fancyes rather then what's fit. Which Errour thou obseruing, and our age Fallen into an incurable Disease, Walk'st not with those in common Equipage, But writ'st as well to profit as to please. This little Booke shewes Wit and Learning to, A great deale more than greater Volumes doe. W. L. THE BLAZON of Jealousie. The Blazon of Jealousie is a prose discourse illustrated by quotations from Italian and Latin poets. Tofte's translations of the verse content (except 2 or 3 line fragments) are included here. Also included are those verse elements from Tofte's running commentary that appear to be written or translated by Tofte. [Looke, but aright, and long but for your owne.] Taken from Tofte's commentary. Looke, but aright, and long but for your owne. Heare all alike, and Trust, when Truth is knowne. Taste (but to feed) yet feede not (still to please.) Touch neuer more, than lawfull is to sieze. The Senses thus you (rightly) shall enioy, Which (oft) makes many, Seruants of annoy. SONETTO. Care, thou that nourishest thy selfe, o'er bold With Feare, encreasing still, and soone dost game Credit, to thy suspitions, whilst chill cold Thou minglest with a hot and burning Flame; By which thou all the Kingdome of milde Loue Dost trouble, heauy make, and too much moue? Since thou so soone vpon my sugred Sweete Hast mixt thy bitter Drugs, hence from my Heart, Turne backe to Cocitus, and to those Icies Deepe, Those sad, and wofull waters, full of smart; Pack (hence) to Hell, thou worse than hellish Elfe, There, vexe, torment, and gawlethine inward selfe: There (without rest) prolong thy weary dayes; There, let thy nights, withouten sleepe be spent; There torture still, and grieue thy selfe (alwayes) As well with doubtfull, as sure punishment: Fret thine owne bowels forth, stamp, stare, be mad, Be euer heauy, neuer blithe, nor glad. Dispatch, begone; why fiercer than before, And farre more stronger, then thou wontst to be, (Since venim thine, to poyson mee the more, Through euery veyne dispersed is in mee.) Dost thou returne (afresh) in shadowes new, The more to make me still to waile and rew? [Fayre Ladies, yee, who talking vp and downe this way] Fayre Ladies, yee, who talking vp and downe this way, Pleasant and sad, accompanied, yet (alone) I see, Ah, tell me, where's my Life? where is my Death I pray? Why, is shee (now) not here? as she was wont to be. Pleasant we are, when her we call but to our minde: Sad, that, we cannot haue her wisht-for Company, Whom Envy and bad Iealovsie doe stay behind, Whom neighbors good, more than their own mishap makes cry. But who can Louers bridle? who Lawes can them giue? None can the Mind restraine. Anger and deep Despight The Body for a while (perhaps) may vexe and grieue, Which (now) on Her, and (then) on Me doth often light. Yet if the Countenance be the Harts bright myrrour true (As oft it is) then did we see her Beautie fayre, To be ecclipst, whilst wee her louely Eyes did view Teares to distill from Limbecke of sad Care, My comfort's this, in me fault was there none, 'Twas dread of lewd Tongues made her stay at home. [My mortall Foe, in whom you wonted were to see] My mortall Foe, in whom you wonted were to see Your diamond eyes, which heauen &amp; loue do honor much Not with his Beautie, (but your owne) makes you to be Enamourd; tis so rare, so sweet, of Vertue such: (Lady) by his aduise you haue cashiered me, (A wofull Exile, from that louely Lodge of mine) Although I yeeld my selfe vnworthy for to be Placed; where you sit crown'd with Fauour most diuine. But had I bin (as you made show) deare in your Loue, Me thinkes a paltry Looking-glasse in my disgrace Should not haue made you halfe so proud, as to remoue Your fancy from me, which you on your selfe (now) place. Assure you, if you thinke but on Narcissus fall, Your Destiny, and his, are like to be all one, Although the ground (when you turne to a Flowre) shall Vnworthy be for to enioy so rare a One. Remember Pride's the roote of euery sinne: Rather be Courteous, so you prayse shall winne. [If th' amorous Thought of mine that vexeth mee.] If th' amorous Thought of mine that vexeth mee. As it is fierce, had colour like the same, Perhaps my Body then should heated be, And I should Partner be, in that Loues Flame, That Flame of Loue which now doth sleepe in her (May chance) would then beginne in me to stirre. If so, I then should not so idly liue, I then (abroad) should waite and on her tend; Nor I so much with weeping (then) should grieue, And Heate, not Colde, from me should still ascend: I should be turned into nought but Fire, The Brand of Loue, the Torch of hot Desire. [You neede not thus to stand in so great feare] You neede not thus to stand in so great feare, Nor to be watched, so, by him that loues you deare, As if you doubted, (as it seemes to mee) That by your owne selfe you should stollen be. [Art thou a faithfull Friend and seek'st] Art thou a faithfull Friend and seek'st To cheate me of my Loue? And break'st (in priuate) Friendships Bonds, Confirm'd by Gods aboue? [To toule me in, and draw me on] To toule me in, and draw me on, Most cunning art thou (LOVE,) Sweet meate (at first) but afterward Sowre sawce thou mak'st me proue, Why shouldst to mee thus cruell show? What credit ist for thee? A God to entrap a silly wretch, Think'st thou 'twill Glory be? [The better for to bring me to thy Lure] The better for to bring me to thy Lure, And as thy prise and pray to get me sure, (Love) thou, at first, dost lay thy tising bait Most cunningly, to catch me with deceit: Sweetly and mildely, thou dost set thy ginne, By sugred smiles and lookes to draw me in: But (woe is me) no sooner am I caught, But that I finde to danger I am brought. Thine Entertainment day and night is such, As makes me grieue and sorrow ouer-much: Why art so spightfull, and incenst gainst mee, When better guerdon'd I deserue to be? No doubt great glory shall to thee redound, When it abroad shall euerywhere be found, A mighty God, a silly man did ketch Within his Nets, by force and subtill fetch. [My Wench is gone and stollen away] My Wench is gone and stollen away, Whom I did loue so deare, And art my Friend, and yet forbidst, That I from teares forbeare? [Stab me with Sword, or Poyson strong] Stab me with Sword, or Poyson strong Giue mee to worke my bane, So thou court not my Lasse, so thou From Mistresse mine refraine, Command my selfe, my Body, Purse, (As thine owne Goods) take All, And as my nearest, dearest Frend, I (euer) vse thee shall: Oh spare my Loue, to haue (alone) Her, to my selfe I craue, Swounds Ioue himselfe Ile not endure My Riuall for to haue. [What's lawfull, base, what's hard to get] What's lawfull, base, what's hard to get, More eager doth vs moue: Senselesse, that suffreth others court His Wife, yet her will loue. [Too much of easie yeelding Loue] Too much of easie yeelding Loue My minde doth soone annoy, Too much of common daintie Fare The Stomacke (still) doth cloy. [So many Sutors to endure] So many Sutors to endure, Thy patience sheweth too base, Another seeke, as Riuall now, For to supply my place. [CARE, who as vigilant, dost alwayes watch] Taken from Tofte's commentary. CARE, who as vigilant, dost alwayes watch, Perswading mee to what is worse than ill, And seek'st my pensiue Heart still for to catch, To force him yeeld to thy accursed will, Making me leade a heauy wofull life, Whereas (before) Pleasures with me were rife. Bane to my sweetest Thoughts, thou gloomy storme, That all my Hopes and best Times ouerthrowes: Why with Suspicions new mak'st me forlorne? Why dost thou vexe my minde with wicked woes? Why dost thou gall me more and more each houre, To wreake thy vengeance on me through thy power? O Monster fierce, more Fierce then monsterous! O Pestilent plague of loyall Louers true! What hellish Fiend, what Hagge most furious From that deepe horrid Caue, thee (hither) drew? Why in so hydeous shape dost thou appeare? To torture mee, and spoyle my pleasures here? Packe hence, away, thy power th' hast too much showne, And therefore mest full Iucke, with trembling Feare Shall write the Sorrowes which through thee are growne, And wofull plaints which in my Breast I beare. (Damn'd Iealovsie) Ile blaze thee, Herauld-like, That all the world may loath thee with despight. [Anon through all the Cities great] Anon through all the Cities great of Africque, Fame is gone, That blazing Flame, a Mischiefe such, as swifter there is none, By mouing more shee breedes, and as shee runnes her might doth rise. Below (for feare) shee lurketh, first, then straight aloft, in skies She mounteth. [As t'is a blessed thing God to behold in skie] As t'is a blessed thing God to behold in skie, So blessed, as wee can, nor ought, to couet more: So happy am I when I view thy face with eye, Since nothing in this world I doe so much adore, Nor haue I seene thee fayrer then I view thee now, Unlesse mine Eyes (as partiall) iuggle with Conceit; Hope of my Life, the Mindes chiefe Beauty true, On whom (as dutie bindes) my Heart doth wait: But th' art no sooner seene, but art straight out of sight, Else would I not thy Company so much desire; Then if some liue by Sent, (as wee beleeue) they write By Water some, and some by Taste, by Touch, and Fire, Why by your sweet sight then, should I not liue, Feeding on nothing else, since life you giue? [Once was I wont to comfort me in sleepe] Once was I wont to comfort me in sleepe With that sweet heauenly face of Mistresse mine; But now in Feare and Griefe it doth me keepe, (Yet Greife nor Feare can ease mee any time) Me thought I saw within that beauteous Face True Pittie, and still Sorrow plac't aright, My Heart gaue firme Beliefe to this sad Case, Disarming mee of Hope, and Pleasure quite. Remember well said shee, that latest Eue, That Night in which I left thee weeping so, And when (constrain'd through Time) which mee did grieue, I went my wayes and left thee plung'd in Woe, Then could not I tell thee so much for Griefe. Now doe I tell thee what thou find'st too true, Dispayre therefore, and thinke not of reliefe Thou (neuer more) mee in this world shalt view. Too true I heard what my sicke Heart beleeu'd, And (euer) shall, for which it still hath grieu'd. [A Womans Tongue that is as swift as Thought] Taken from Tofte's commentary. A Womans Tongue that is as swift as Thought, Is euer bad, and she her selfe starke Nought: But shee that seldome speakes and mildly then, Is a rare Pearle amongst all other Women. Maides must be seene, not heard, or selde or neuer, O may I such one wed, if I, wed euer. A Maide that hath a lewd Tongue in her head, Worse than if she were found with a Man in bed. Be she best of her Sexe, (Good All,) I hold, She is worse then worst, if once she proue a Scold. Flye then such Furies as (still) scold and raile, Queanes of their Tongue, are (most) Queanes of their Taile. [Loue, which enflam'st the troubled Heart] Loue, which enflam'st the troubled Heart with burning Zeale And kep'st him shut in Prison fast with icy Feare; And (which is most) to'th doubtfull sense dost not reueale Or Hope, or Feare, or Fire, or Ice, which he doth beare. In greatest Heate I shake; and burne in coldest time: Full of Desire, and yet is my suspect as much As if a Woman should hide vnder garments fine Some liuing man, (although there can be nothing such.) Of all these plagues, the first is proper vnto mee, To burne both day and night, yet how this harmefull flame Is sweet in minde, and pleasant seemeth for to be No thought can well expresse, nor pen can write the same: The other's none of mine, for my fire's of such power, As goeth beyond the force of man so farre to reach: Who thinkes by his flight to the height thereof to skoure: Flies but in vaine, and soone a dangerous fall may catch: Well may All striue this golden Ball to gaine, But in the end they shall (deceiu'd) remaine. [A modest and maiestike Lady did I see] A modest and maiestike Lady did I see, Betwixt two Louers; of which twaine my selfe was one. The other, the glorious Sunne with his most brightsome glee: The Sunne on th' one side, I on th' other then was gone. But when she did perceiue, she compast was about With the hot rayes of her braue and heroycke friend, She (smiling) turned toward me, and wound her selfe thereout. (Ah would that she had neuer vs'd me more vnkind,) This made me quickly turne my Ielousie to ioy, Which at the first began to grow within my hart, Lest such a mighty aduersary should me noy; Which he had done, but that shee (soone) from him did part. This caus'd him seeme to haue a sad and watry face, Whilest that a pretty shower did compasse him each side As he did gloomy show because of his disgrace, So much to be o'recome; did it pull downe his pride: The Sunne so grieu'd at Lauras deepe disdaine, As his bright Beames were turn'd to duskie raine. [My question's why Ægistus lewd] My question's why Ægistus lewd became Adulterer vile, Tis answer'd: Hee not labour would, his lasinesse did him spoyle. [High Colour (in a Woman) Choler showes] Taken from Tofte's commentary. High Colour (in a Woman) Choler showes, And shee's vnwholsome that like Sorrell growes, Nought are the Peeuish, Proud, Malitious, But worst of all the Red, shrill, Iealious. [A slow soft Tongue betokens Modestie] Taken from Tofte's commentary. A slow soft Tongue betokens Modestie, But, quicke and loud signe's of Inconstancy: Words, more then swords, the inward Heart doe wound, And glib'd tongue'd Women seldome chaste are found. Much tongue in Wiues is bad, in Maides farre worse, A long tonqu'd Maide is right the Diuels dry Nurse: He roares aloud, shee scoldeth shrill like bell; Both worse than Fiends, both fit to liue in Hell. [But neyther rauening Tyger mad] But neyther rauening Tyger mad, Nor wildest foaming Bore, Are halfe so fierce, baited by Dogs, Whom they doe panch and gore: Nor ruthlesse Lionesse, who sucke Giues to her little ones: Nor Viper, quicke, trod on by chance By Traueller on the stones: As is a iealous Womans minde, Whom Fury doth enflame. Her gastly Count'nance showes her Thoughts, None can her malice tame: To Sword and Fire shee flyes, all Shame Shee casteth from her quite, Like such as are possest in Soule, With some most hellish Spright. Behold Medea, how shee seekes, Reuengement for to take Upon her Children and her Spouse. Whom shee away would make. Another cruell mother is The Swallow, which you see Begor'd with bloud on brest, a marke That with her Fact doth gree, This is that damned Iealovsie, Which o'er much Loue doth breede. The wiser sort must shunne this Fiend, And of the same take heede. [My loueliest Flame, more beauteous then the best] My loueliest Flame, more beauteous then the best, Who had the heauens (her country) so much at command Is thither gone; where, with the blessed, she doth rest, And (as a glorious star) by Venus (there) doth stand, Now I beginne to wake, &amp; (by Her) I doe finde, That (for my Good) she crost me in my prime Desire, And with a sweet disdaine (for my deserts) too kinde, She temper did my more than hot and raging Fire. I humbly thanke her, and thanke her Discretion sage, Who with such mildnes cool'd my hasty youthfull Heate, Whilst I giuen o'er through fancy fond to raue and rage, My Mind (thus yong) about my soules health I did beat. O dainty Arts, and rare Effects, fit for the same: The one, my Verse, her matchles face, the other, wrought. She vertuous seedes did sow in me, I rais'd her Fame: Her sacred selfe, my witty Braine, to passe this brought. Thrice happy I, if that so rare a Muse Had liued (still) Grace in me to infuse. [Hope is the sad Hearts helpe] Taken from Tofte's commentary. Hope is the sad Hearts helpe, the sicke Thoughts Friend, And what Distrust impaires, Hope doth amend. True Hope is swift, and flyes with Swallowes wings, Kings it makes Gods, and meanest Creatures Kings. [If Virgil, or learn'd Homer seene had my Sun bright] If Virgil, or learn'd Homer seene had my Sun bright, Which I so oft behold with these my happy eyes, They would haue mixt (to blaze her Fame) their vtmost might, In both their tongues they would haue rais'd her to the Skies: They would haue made Æneas discontent and sad, Achillis, graue Vlissis, many Heroies then, Augustus, and Orestes, (who Ægistus had Did kill) should still haue laine in darke Obliuions don: Old Ennius sang in harsh and ragged formed Verse, Don Scipios praise (the matchlesse wonder of his age.) I striue a peerelesse Virgins fame for to rehearse, Who wins the Garland for her vertuous carriage sage. Heauens grant, though (for this subiect) meane's my wit, That shee'l not skorne me, but accept of it. [No doubt, some Fiend, this Looking-glasse did make] No doubt, some Fiend, this Looking-glasse did make, Within the waters of th' infernall Lake; Forgetfulnesse eternall, dyed the same From whence (at first) did spring my mortall bane. [That which breakes Louers chaste designes in twaine] That which breakes Louers chaste designes in twaine, And giues to Many, what (to One) doth appertaine, Is that which fils mens hearts with furious sire, And (topsi turui) turnes each amorous desire; Is that which makes Men wish (so oft) to dye, And to contest gainst God, he is borne disasterously; Makes him disclaime his Goodnesse and his Grace, When as he findes himselfe in such hard case: To liue as one forsooke, and quite exild, From all good Fortune, and from pitty milde: [Each thing affrights me, I doe feare] Each thing affrights me, I doe feare Ah pardon mee, my feare. I doubt a man is hid within The cloathes which thou dost weare: If thine owne Mother kisse thee (oft) Or Sister thine, I grieue: I feare the Mayde that lyeth with thee, And in thy House doth liue. Each thing makes me suspect; I looke With iealous watchfull eye; The Nurse makes me to doubt, and Childe That doth in Cradle lye. [As if a woman in her Gowne] As if a woman in her Gowne, Or in a slender Vayle, A liuing man should (secret) hide, Which is a senslesse tale. [I mine owne shadowes dread, alone] I mine owne shadowes dread, alone, Which (nothing are) in vaine, And, like a foole, through foolish feare, Oft put my selfe in paine. [But thou (kinde Witall) Husband thou] But thou (kinde Witall) Husband thou Unto my subtle Wench, I pray thee haue a watchfull eye, Least shee play false at Fence. [I dread (Aurora) least] I dread (Aurora) least for Cephalus thou would Haue chosen him, saue that thy former Rape doth thee with-hold: If Phœbe view him (once) that all suruayes with Eye, My Phao shall be quickely forc't in slumbers long to lye: In Iuory Waggon would Dame Venus to the Starres Haue borne him, but she fear'd, hee would haue coyde the God of Warres. [There's no vnkindnesse like Loue wrong'd] There's no vnkindnesse like Loue wrong'd, Such things most bitter are to mee, Let me mine owne throate cut; yet I A kinde Foe to my selfe shall be: With what face can I see strange Armes My Wench for to imbrace and twine, When shee anothers shall be tearm'd, Who (but euen now) was called Mine? Sure all things change and Louers mindes Doe change, and (changing) proue. Winne thou in Loue, or doe thou loose, So turnes the wheele of Loue. [When Heauen would striue to doe the best shee can] Taken from Tofte's commentary. When Heauen would striue to doe the best shee can, And put an Angels spirit into a Man. Then all her powers shee in that Worke doth spend, When shee a Poet to the world doth send; The difference onely twixt the Gods and Vs, Allow'd by them, is but distinguisht thus; They giue them breath, Men by their Powers are borne, That life they giue the Poet doth adorne: And from the world, when they dissolue mans breath, They in the world doe giue Man life in death. [Who is resolu'd to lead his life vnsure] Who is resolu'd to lead his life vnsure, Amid the wauering Seas and Rockes so high Fearelesse of death in Barke which cannot dure, Must make account he to his End is nigh. 'Tis good for such an one to hoyse his sayle, And towards the Hauen get for his auayle. [Well maist thou (Po) my body carry fast] Well maist thou (Po) my body carry fast, By reason of thy swift and mightie wane, My Soule the Ghest within this lodging plac't, For all thy force with thee, thou canst not haue: This neare giues o'er, but striues to mount on high, Forcing (herselfe) vnto the clouds to glide, Vntill it to that happy place come nigh, Where it doth hope in perfect Blisse to bide: Thou Prince of Riuers, prouder than the rest, Encountring with the Sunne when day doth breake: And in the ponent of that Light quite disposest, Where waters thine beginne for to grow weake, Beare thou this outward shape alone with thee, Whilst my Soule in her sweet lodge longs to be. [What is not Love? tis All, Vertue and Vice] Taken from Tofte's commentary. What is not Love? tis All, Vertue and Vice, Humble, proud, witty, foolish, kinde and nice; A golden bubble, blowne big with idle Dreames, That waking breakes, and fils vs with Extreames. Love backeward speld (put I for O) is Evil Adde D before the same, and tis the Devil. A Devil 'tis, and mischiefe such doth worke, As neuer yet did Pagan, Iew, nor Turke. [Ladies, it tedious were to set downe here] Ladies, it tedious were to set downe here, How much I grieue at my new libertie, Since I brake prison; where so many yeere Loue kept mee (as he pleas'd) most watchfully, My Heart would tell mee oft hee could not liue, But as hee did, whilst Cupid (subtle Elfe) Met me in Shadowes false, me (more) to grieue, And might deceiue a wiser than my selfe. This makes me oft looke backe, and (sighing) say Woe's me too late, now to my losse I finde, 'Tis worse with mee now I am scap't away, My Yoake and Chaines were wont to be more kinde: Too late I now perceiue my wilfull fall, And hardly (now) can I my selfe vntwine From my first Error, which I would recall, In which I wound my selfe through Follies mine; When I was bound, I then wisht to be free; Now I am freed, I loath my Libertie. [Grecinus, well I wot thou told'st me once] Taken from Tofte's commentary. Grecinus, well I wot thou told'st me once, I could not be in Loue with two at once; By thee deceiu'd, by thee surpris'd am I, For now I Loue two Women equally: Both are well fauoured, both rich in aray, And which the lou'liest is, t'is hard to say, This seemes the fairest, so doth that to me, And this doth please me most, and so doth she: Euen as a Boat tost by contrary Winde, So with this Loue, and that wauers my Minde. [What is the reason (tell me) cruell Loue] What is the reason (tell me) cruell Loue, That gainst all common sence I wretch should proue, And beare two fires, when I haue but one hart, For Cinthia and for Flora, more to make me smart? [Fayre Ladies, he that shall loue more] Fayre Ladies, he that shall loue more Than one of any you; And at one time dissembler is, His Loue can not be true: His mind's beyond his might, like he That with his daring eye Stands staring on the Sunny beames, And blinded is thereby: [The trewest Loue (sometim's) suspicious] Taken from Tofte's commentary. The trewest Loue (sometim's) suspicious, And feedes on Cares and Feares most amorous; Nor can Love liue without some Iealovsie. Which tane away, it strait begins to dye. [T'is fast good-will, and gentle curtesies] Taken from Tofte's commentary. T'is fast good-will, and gentle curtesies, Reclaimes a Woman, and not watching eyes; For where Suspect directeth forward wils, Beauties sweet dalliance with despight it kils: And where a Man is Iealous without cause, The Woman good, for to be bad (oft) drawes.
