      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOLABLE Philip Earle of Mountgomery, Lord Herbert of Sherland, and of the most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight. To the Noble English Nation. Renowned English! whom our Lines invite, To view the acts of Warwicks worthy Knight; Whose deeds of old, writ with an antient Pen, Have now out-worn the memories of men. Most strange in this same Poet plenty age, Where Epigrams, and Satyres biting rage: Where Paper is imployed every day, To carry Verse about the Town for pay: That Stories should intomb'd with Worthies lie, And fame, through age extinct, obscurely die. Dain to accept what Recreations hours, Have spent upon this Country man of ours: It seems too far unkind, that in those days. We toil so much in other Nations praise, That we neglect the famousing of our own, Which over-matchfull unto them were known. England hath bred such men of valour tri'd, Could match all Kingdoms of the World beside, Take here a view of Knight-hoods antient face, His bruised Armour, and his bloody case: His broken Launce, gapt Faulch'on, batter'd Shield, His valiant Combates with his Foes in Field: The wounds and scarrs insculpt upon his flesh, His mortal fights renew'd each day afresh; His reasons that did animate to Arms, His freeing tender Ladies from their harms; His hacked Target, and his splinter'd Spear, His killing Serpents, savage Bore, and bear. Then looke on some, in ages since be-knighted, Who never were with Martial deeds delighted: That are no kin to them which went of old In Iron Armour, these are Knights in gold: And you shall see that one doth wear the Name, When th' others actions merit for the same. The same for merit was renowned Guy, A Champion that his fame with blood did buy; And never held his life in coward fear, But ventur'd it at point of sword and spear: He was a prodigal of life and lim, And bade all welcome, came to fight with him: Were it a Giant like to Gogmagog, Or Cerberus, that Triple-headed Dog, Or he that often did Olympus climbe, And was the onely Club-man of his time, Great Hercules, if he had breath'd on ground, When English Guy of Warwick liv'd renown'd, There would have been a combate 'twixt them two, To try what stout Alcides force could do: Or Hector, whose applaud the world doth know, Or fierce Achilles, fearfull to his Foe. Had all these liv'd together in an age, They had been Combatants, the earth their stage. Kind English, yield unto your Country-man As gentle entertainment as you can: Though he lie quiet now transform'd to dust, Sleeping in death, as other Mortalls must: With your life-giving breath, revive his Fame, That hath deserv'd an honourable name. And having view'd his Actions, wish with me, That all the Knights we have, were such as he. S. R. To the Honourable LADIES of ENGLAND. Ladies, in elder times your Sex did need Knighthoods true Valour to defend your Rights, Of admirable Actions we do read, Have been atcheiv'd in cruel bloody fights, Full ugly Serpents were destroy'd and slain, Strange Monsters mangled, Giants hew'd in twain. But who deserv'd more in such enterprize Than worthy English, bred where we are born? Such as did ease and idleness despise: For Armour more by them than silk was worn. These were the Champions, that for Ladies good, Would bleed as long as they had drops of blood. Such as Sir GUY, whose story here we tell, Valours renowned honourable man: He lov'd your Kind (in heart exceeding well), How can you chuse but love his Legend then? Bestow the reading of it, if you please, 'Gainst melancholy, that same Dull Disease. Samuel Rowland. THE FAMOUS HISTORY OF Guy Earl of Warwick. The Argument. Guy of Warwick (Son to Earl ROBAND's Steward) (blooming youth of Natures spring), fell in love with the Earls fair Daughter Phælice whose disdaining of him, in that he was but a mean Gentleman, and not by birth answerable to her honourable estate, did afflict his tormented mind with most distressed passions, till in a vision Cupid presents her with a picture of Mars, enjoyns her to love Guy, as the admired Champion of Christendom. Upon this she yieldeth affection, on Condition of Adventures, which to atchieve, he departs into France, and shortly returns with Trophies of Victory, and Prizes of Honour; But Phælice not satisfied therewith, he leaves England again, performing in foreign Countries wonderful Acts: Then returning, marries his Love, whom after forty days he leaves, departing on Pilgrimage to the Holy-land, effecting in that Journey many strange things: Then supposed to be dead, comes back disguised, and out worn to memory, and fights à Combat for Athelstone, killed Colbrond, the Giant of Denmark, freeing thereby the Kingdom from Invasion. After that, lives obscurely in a Cave, and comes for Alms to his own Castle, not revealing himself till the hour of his death; and then he sent his Lady a Ring, by which token she knew her husband, and came most wofully to close up his eyes; dying her self shortly after him, for very grief and extream sorrow. CANTO I. In Nature's green unmellowed years Cupid tormenteth Guy; Inthrals his heart to Phælice love, by object of the eye. When dreadful Mars in Armor every day Lov'd stately Juno and Bellonia best, Before he knew the Court where Venus lay, For then he took himself to ease and rest; When all his Thoughts unto the proof were steel'd, And all his Actions manag'd in the field. A Knight of his (a worthy English man) That went like him, clad in an Iron Coat, In Warwick, with the worlds applaud began To be a man of admirable note: Such was the Valour he ascended by, That Pagans trembled at the Name of Guy. This man compos'd of courage, full of sprite, Of hard adventures, and of great designs. To fight with Giants took a chief delight, Or search some Cave that Monster undermines; Meet with a Boar to make a bloody fray, Or combat with a Dragon by the way. Yet ere he entertain'd his Love to Arms, He grew devoted to the Queen of Love, Attempting Beauties Fort with fierce Alarms, The victory of such a prize to prove, As elder times before could ne're injoy; A sweeter face than lost old Priam Troy. Fair Phælice, equal match to Cupid's Mother; A curious creature, and the Kingdoms pride; All spacious Britain had not such another, For glorious beauty, and good parts beside: 'Twixt her and Vulcan's wife no odds were known, But Venus had a Mole, and she had none. For most directly she had Venus hair, The same high fore-head, and attractive eye: Her cheeks of Roses mixt with Lillies fair; The very lips of perfect Coral-dye: Ivory teeth, a dainty rising chin, A soft touch, pleasing, smooth, and silken skin. With all perfections made a peerless Creature From head to foot, she had them every one: Mirrour she was of comeliness and feature, An English Phænix, supreme fair alone: Whom gazing peoples censures thus would grace, Beauty lives no where but in Phælice face: In Phælice face (this object of Guy's sight) Where looks of love, and glances of disdain, From thence sometimes his eyes attract delight, From thence anon his heart depriveth pain. One while sweet smiles do give encouragement, Another time stern looks work discontent. Thus on Love's Seas, tost by the storms of terrour, 'Twixt present calm, and sudden furious blast; Resolving love, yet finding love in error, In freedom chain'd, in liberty bound fast; He sighs that fortune doth so strangely deal, To give a wound that Beauty will not heal; That Beauty will not heal (quoth he) fond man, Thou wrong'st thy self, and thy fair Goddess too; By looks to know a womans heart who can? And look on her is only all I do: I'le take another course more resolute, To speak, to write my honest meaning suit. But if I should be so, what hope have I That she will hear my words, or read my lines She is Earl Roband's heir, and born too high To condescend unto my poor designs: Though I a Gentleman by birth am known, Earldoms I want, and Lordships I have none. O! Women are ambitious out of measure, They mount aloft upon the wings of pride; And often match more for this worldly Treasure, Than any loving cause on earth beside; Which makes some wish rather there were no gold, Than love for it should base be bought and sold. If such she be (as not be such is rare) What will my words, or sighs, or tears prevail? I enter then a Labyrinth of care, And strive against both wind and tide to sail: A restless stone with Sisyphus I roul, And heap continual torments on my soul, Then I attempt to fly with waxen wings, Where Phœbus Chariot burns in brightest flame; And shall be censur'd, that in childish things, As Love, I have begot eternal shame: Rejected and despis'd, in base esteem To th' envious world, I shall no better seem. But cease, Loves coward, banish thoughts of fear, Be resolute, and good success attend thee; Phælice of force a loving heart must bear; If he that shoots love-darts of gold befriend thee, And by no reason he can be thy foe, Because thou lov'st his mothers picture so. I am resolv'd: Go on to Phælice Bower, And from as true a heart as flesh can yield, Intreae her hear me in a blessed hour; And with kind pity all my sorrows shield; To look upon me with remorse of mind, That holds my lift as her love is inclind. This said, to Warwick Castle he repairs, Where the rich Jewel of his heart remain'd; Earl Robamd bids him welcome, and prepaers With hunting-sports to have him entertain'd: But thereunto unwilling ear he lends, And sudden sickness for excuse pretends. The Earl much grieved at this alteration, Sent his physician for to do him good; Who told Guy, that his only preservation, Consisted in the present letting blood: And that his body in distemperature, Was difficult and very hard to cure. Doctor (quoth Guy) 'tis true I know as much, I find my self to be exceeding ill; But there's a flower, which if I might but touch, Would heal me better than thy physick's skill: 'Tis called by a pretty pleasing name, And Phælix soundeth somewhat near the same. Quoth the Physician, Sir, I know it not, Nor in the Herbal read of such a flower: Yet in this Castle it is to be got; Said Guy, it grows not far from yonder Tower. I'le find it out my self, Doctor refrain, Galen ne're had the Art to cure my pain. Left in this passion to converse with moan, As in a window he did sighing lye. In a delightful Garden all alone, The Emp'ress of his thoughts he did espy; Which to his soul did much rejoycing bring, Fear was depos'd, and Hope was Crowned King. Now is the time (quoth he) fair Fortunes Sun Shines favourable on my gloomy cares: Now may I end the grief that love begun, And boldly ask good hap, how well she fares: Now will I enter into yonder shade, To court the worlds admired Beauteous Maid. Phælice I come, assist me (Cupid) now, Prepare an Arrow ready for thy bow: I never went a wooing: Teach me how Good action (with good speech) I may bestow: But above all things, gentle Cupid move her, That she believe me, when I swear I love her. With speed unto the Garden then he goes, Where one of Phælice Damsels let him in; And in a curious Arbour of repose, Finds Cytherea with her silver skin: Whom he salutes with Grace and Majesty. Beholding her with Love's inchanting eye. Fairest (quoth he) of all the works in Nature, Whose Equal never breath'd this common air, More wonderful than Earth can yield a creature, For every part belonging unto fair; Immortal Creature of Cœlestial frame, Eternal honour still attend thy Name I come to thee about the like poor suit, That once Leander came to Hero with, Hoping thereby to reap more lovely fruit Than Mars attain'd when he deceiv'd the smith. 'Tis only Love that I with heart present; 'Tis only Love must give my soul content. Incline (sweet Lady) to my humble motion; Compassionate the grief that I endure. Regard my life that rests at thy devotion, With pity take my dying heart in cure: O let it not in groaning torment swell! And break in twain, because it loves thee well. Great Princes love thee, this I knew before, And deeds of honour for thy Name have done; But neither King nor Prince can love thee more Than doth poor Guy, thy Fathers Stewards Son; His love to thee is so inestimable, To countervail it all, they are not able. Phælice thus interrupts his Protestation: No more of Love, cease gentle Youth (quoth she) I have a mind fram'd of another fashion, Virginity shall live and die with me: Love is compos'd of idleness and play, And leadeth unto vain delights that stray: Besides it ill beseems thee, be so bold, Inferiour and unfit for my degree; And if unto my Father this was told, I know it would procure reproof to thee: That proverb in this point might make thee wife, That Princely Eagles scorn the catching Flies: And with this answer she departed thence, Leaving poor Guy more vexed than before: For now in deep despair of recompence, He never doth expect Love's comfort more; But unto sorrow, sighs and tears doth give, Wishing each day the last he had to live. CANTO II. Guy in strange passions for his Love, great torments doth endure: Till Phælice sees a Vision, and Doth yield her Patient cure. With tired thoughts remains this woful wight, Distracted in his melancholy mind, Partaking nothing that contains delight, All things are harsh, distastful, out of kind: Phælice denies him Love; whose sound of breath, Is like the Judge that dooms a man to death: Like to Orestes in his frantick fits, He tare the golden tresses from his head; Or mad Orlando quite depriv'd of wits, From whom the use of sense and reason fled; So fares it with this Love-tormented man, Whose raging thoughts into disorders ran. Society he shuns, and keeps alone, Accusing Destiny, and cursing Beauty; He hates himself, and is a friend to none, Beyond the limits of all love and duty. Venus (quoth he) how are thy Laws forgot, Thus to afflict him that offends thee not? What is the cause I am rejected thus? Who interrupts my love to Beauties mirror? I'le drag him hence to roaring Erebus, There to be plunged in eternal terror. I'le to Jove's Court, and there with shouts and cries; Make such a clamour as shall rent the skies. Shall I be cozen'd as Orpheus was? Assist me Theseus to revenge this wrong. Where's Radamant, that Justice cannot pass; Euridice is sold even for a song: Fiends, Furies, Goblins, Hidra's, for a fall, I am prepar'd to manage with you all. I'le mount upon the back of Pegasus, And in bright Phœbus flames my self will wrap: Then will I tumble windy Eolus To sleep in Thetis watery crystal lap: From thence I'le post unto the Torrid Zone, To find which way fair Phælice Love is gone: Jason had luck to win the golden fleece; I like the skin, but for the horns I care not; Fair Hellen was a waggish Wench of Greece: Bold Mars will venture, bashful Venus cares not. Trust a fair face! Not I, let him that lift; What Hercules without a Club in's fist? Thus for a time his Senses were deprived, Being left by love as blind as Cupid's eyes; Till Reason to perfections state revived, And extream passions cease to Tyrannize: For in a Vision Phælice did descry The power of Love, and yields her heart to Guy:A woodcut illustration appears here in the text with the following caption: Fair Phælice in a Vision Entertains the love of Guy; Injoyning him adventures strange, His manly foce to try By Morphæus possest of quiet sleep, In dead of night, when Visions do appear, The heart-tormentor, he that pierceh deep, And maketh Lovers buy their bargain dear, Sends from his bow a shaft with golden head, And wounded Phælice in her Maiden-bed. Before her he presents a Martial wight, Clad all in Armour for Encounters fit; And says, Sweet Virgin, love this man of might, Give him the heart, for he doth merit it; For valour, courage, comely shape and limb, The world hath not a Champion like to him. Great honour (Lady) thou shalt gain thereby, T'adorn thy noble and renowned birth; He shall aspire unto such Majesty. His Name shall be a terror on the Earth. He shall become a Champion unto Kings, And by the Sword perform admired things. Be not ambitious that thou art high-born; Be not disdainful of a mean Estate; Be not defiled with the brand of scorn; Be not too proud that thou art Beauties mate: For 'tis in vain to strive against my bow; If I say, Love, it must and shall be so. Fix not thy thoughts vainly on worldly wealth, (Coyn should not be foundation unto Love) Corrupted hearts it draws away by stealth; These Money-matches cannot happy prove: For as the goods of Fortune do decay, So love, which they beget, consumes away. I know how Pluto's golden Treasure sways, By devillish and accursed false illusion: I know how Womens humours now a-days, Run after Riches to their own confusion; I see the pleasant with most abject life, With Gold enough can buy a dainty Wife. But Phælice, if thou knew'st as much as I, How base the Gods esteem of such abuses, When Beauty sells, and Riches comes to buy, Which are not made for one another's uses; Thou wouldest scorn that Maidens should be sold As Cattel are, for Silver and for Gold. Love must be simple, harmless, pure and plain, And take original from true affection; It must reciprocal return again, Or else it doth discover imperfection; Love's inward thoughts concur in outward deeds, Such as from loyalty and truth proceeds; Thy Lover comes not for advancement to thee; In that thy Father is a worthy Earl; It is not Dowry that can cause him woo thee; Hadst thou the Arabian Gold, or Indian Pearl. But as great Jupiter to Leda came For a sweet Face, his purpose is the same. Therefore sweet Virgin use him kindly well, Make much of Guy, embrace him for thine own; Afford him Love room in thy heart to dwell; Let him no longer live in pensive moan: But the next time thou dost behold his face, Give him encouragement, with kind embrace: And with that word (imbrace) he shot, and hit The very Center of her tender heart; Feeling the wound, she starts, awak'd with it, Being taught thereby to pity Lovers smart, For Cupid drew his Arrow to the head, Because he would be sure she should be sped. With that she fetch'd a sigh, a grievous one, And from her eyes a show'r of Tears did fall. Where is (quoth she) the gentle Love-God gone, Whose power I find is powerful over all? Oh! call him back, my fault I do confess, I have in Love been too too pitiless. Sweet Boy, sollicite for me to thy Mother, And at her Altars I will sacrifice, From this day forth I will adore no other, No Goddess shall be gracious in mine eyes, But she that hath imperious rule and might, To lead obdurate hearts to kind delight, Compassion now hath worthy Conquest made Of that strong Fort that did resistance make. One shaft had been sufficient to perswade A League for life, a Truce till death doth take, Guy more than Life, doth Phælice love prefer, Phælice affects Guy dear, as he doth her. But unto him her love is yet unknown, Though his be made apparent long before. He understands not that she is his own, He feels no salve appli'd unto his sore, Till forc'd by passions, and constrain'd laments, A second Suit he boldly thus presents. Phelice, I was arraigned long ago, And now I look for Judgement at thy hand: I have been Prisoner in a Jayl of wo So long, that speedy sentence I demand: Oh speak unto me either life or death! For I am tired with my vital breath. If kindness dwell in that fair shape of thine, Express it with (I love); if none there be, Then say, I cannot unto love incline; And so thou mak'st a quick dispatch with me: Censure me sudden, either smile or frown, I will not live thus for this Kingdom's Crown, Phælice reply'd, 'Tis not at my dispose, To fashion Love, without my Friends consent, What, would you wish me to be one of those That are to Parents disobedient? Shall fond affections over-rule the will, And do you good, to be accounted ill? You know my Father's greatness in the Land, And if he should (as there's no other like) The love of one too mean for me, withstand, How could we bear the stroke disgrace would strike? Nothing but death would make my sorrow sweet, And shame would wrap me in a Winding sheet. Doubt not of Father in this case (quoth he) For Warwick's Earl (the Honourable man) Shall see such deeds of valour done by me, To have dislike he neither will nor can. Injoyn me what adventures thou think'st good, That wounds and scars may let my body blood. Why then (quoth she) Guy make thy Valour shine Throughout the world, as glorious as the Sun; My heart, my soul, my life, my love is thine: What deeds of honour by thy hands are done: Make thy self famous by a Martial life, And then take Phælice for thy lawful wife. I ask no more (said he) to gain thy love, I shall esteem it bought at easie rate: O that I were at work, my task to prove, With Hercules, or some such churlish Mate. Phælice farewell, this kiss thou gavest me, Shall make a number kiss the ground for thee. CANTO III. From England Guy to France doth go Where deeds of Arms are done; And thence returns triumphantly, With all his Prizes won. Inlarg'd from sorrow's thraldom by hope's bail, Guy arms his thoughts with Honours enterprize, Imbarks himself, and into France doth fail Leaving fair England, where his comfort lies, He seeks for Enemies, he longs for Foes, And now desires to be a dealing blows. In Normandy arriv'd, he understands That there was Warlike business to be done, For valiant Knights of divers Christian Lands, The race of Valour did intend to run: A great advantage was propounded there, Which news was musick to his greedy ear, The prize that drew them all unto this Place, Was Daughter to the Almain Emperor, For Blanch, with such a wondrous heavenly face, It had attractive beauty full of power: In her such Graces did unite together, The Worthies of the world came posting thither. Who won the Damsel (it was thus decreed) By manly courage, and victorious might, Should have her mounted on a milk-white Steed, Two Greyhounds and a Faulcon, all in white: This was his lot that could attain the day, To bear the Honour, and the Maid away. Our English Knight prepares him for the Field Where Kings were present, Princes did repair; Where Dukes and Earls a great Assembly held About the face that was so wondrous fair: Though only one must speed, and hundreds miss, Yet each man there imagines Blanch is his. The spacious field where they assembled were, Hardly affordeth room for Armed Crouds: The golden glittering Armour that was there, Did dart the Sun-beams back into the Clouds: The pamper'd horses proudly stamp the ground, To hear the clamour of the Trumpets sound. A German Prince of an undaunted sprite, A first and very fierce Encounter gave Unto an Earl, whose valour did requite With blow for blow, as resolutely brave; Till by a stroke the Earl receiv'd on's head, He was unhors'd, falling to ground for dead. Then Guy came forth with courage to the Prince, And deals with him as Hercules would do; Like force he never felt before nor since, Such hard extreams he ne're was put unto: Just where himself had laid the Earl in swound, There down comes he, both horse and man to ground. Duke Otton seeing this, was in a rage, And desp'rate humour did incense him so, He vow'd by Heaven nothing should asswage His fury, but the death of that proud Foe. Prepare thee, fight, to breathe thy last (quoth he) Monster, or Devil, or what e're thou be. They joyn together with a dreadful fight, The splinters fly, and clatteing Armour sounds; The dust ascended up, and blinds their sight; The blood allays it, streaming forth their wounds; Both their swords break, they light, and on his back Guy threw the Duke, that ev'n his bones did crack. Duke Rainer would revenge his Cousin then, And for Encounter he prepareth next. Quoth Guy, I find y'are wretches and no men, That with a blow or fall so soon be vext: But come, and welcome, I am for you all; We say in England, The weakest must to th' wall. They rush together, that the ground did shake, Whilst animating Trumpets sound alarm; In Rainer's shoulder Guy a wound did make, Whereby he lost the use of his right arm; Yielding himself as others did before, Unable once to wield his weapon more. Then for a while all stood amaz'd at Guy, And not a man was forward to proceed; Till Lovaine's Duke his Fortunes went to try, Having good hope that he should better speed: Well mounted, and well arm'd, he fair did sit On a proud Steed, that ill indur'd the bit. I think (quoth he) thou some Inchanter art, That hath the force of Magick in thine arm, I'le teach thee to believe e're we depart, Quoth Guy, for thou shalt feel that I can charm: I'le conjure thee even with an Iron Spell, My sword shall send thee unto Heaven or Hell. With that he lent him such a cruel stroke, That the other did return a weak reply; With second and with third his Helmet broke; Hold, hold (quoth he) I'le rather yield than die: Fight for a Woman he that list for me, I think the Devil cannot deal with thee: Then not a man that would encounter more, They all were terrifi'd and stood in fear; And in a rage among themselves they swore, What shall a stranger all the honour bear Of this great day? What cursed fortune's this, That all the glory of the field is his! Amongst themselves his happiness they curst, In envy's heat, not knowing what to do; They could have kill'd him, but that no man durst Put his own life in hazard thereunto. If wishes might have done it, he had dy'd, But fight with him not any could abide. The Emperor, for Guy, a Knight did send, Asking his Name and Birthright, which he told; Then said His Majesty, I much commend Thy haughty Courage resolutely bold: Brave English man, thou art thy countreys pride, In Europe lives not such a man beside. I do admire thy worth, thy Valour's great; To speak thy praise my tongue cannot suffice; Ascend to Honour's just deserved seat, That art a second Hector in mine eyes. This day thy worthy hand hath shew'd me more Than in my life I ever saw before. Come and receive thy due desert of me, My Daughter's love is free at thy dispose, The Greyhounds, Steed and Faulcon, take to thee; Thy worthiness doth merit more than those: Hold, here's a Jewel, wear it for my sake, Which I a witness of my love do make. Guy thank'd his Highness for his gracious favour, And vow'd him service whilst his life did last, Then to the Princess with a mild behaviour, A reverent, humble, modest look he cast, Saying, Fair Lady, Fortune is my Friend, That doth such beauty to my lot extend. Madam, accept your loyal English Knight, To do true service when you please command it: Who, while he hath a drop of blood, will fight In your behalf, against who dare withstand it: To be your Husband is degree too high; 'Tis Grace sufficient, call me Servant Guy: In England doth my Marriage Love remain, To whom I must and will be true forever; About whose face Nature hath took such pain, I durst have sworn flesh cou'd have matcht it never; But now I find (that curiously have ey'd her) There is a Phœnix in the world beside her, And that's your self; I dare the world deny it; But which is fairest, eye cannot decide, No humane judgment in the world can try it, Who hath most Beauty, Blanch, or my fair Bride, I dare be bold to call your Beauties Twins, And Venns Blackamoor to both your skins. Oh Phælice! here's thy Picture in this Princess, Methinks th' art present in her lovely look: Thou that of my souls faculties art Mistress, Recorded in Time's brazen leaved Book; To thee if I prove false, or be misled, Jove's fearful vengeance light upon my head. Quoth Blanch, Thy constancy (and sighed deep) Is highly to be praised; thou dost well: He that Love's-promise will no faithful keep, In horrors and in torments let him dwell. But I suppose thy vows are yet to make, And so what thy sword won, thy heart may take. What I avouch is true, the Heaven knows, My protestations are above the skies; Madam, the Sun declines, day ancient grows, I'le take my leave of you in humble-wise, My Body is unto repose inclin'd, Although no rest be in my troubled mind. My troubled mind's in Warwick-Castle now, Although my body be in Normandy. Here I make others bend, there I do bow, And lowly as the humble ground do lye, Even at Love's feet I cast my self to ground, Though Victory my Temples here have crown'd. I cannot stay, I must to England back, My mind misgives me, Phælice is not well: Like my sad thoughts, my Armour shall be black! I'le suit me in a mournful Iron-shell: For where the mind meets with suspicious cares, Distrust is ever dealing doubtful shares. Yet I have much good fortune on my side, That know the means how to attain my bliss; For Phælice's Love is to Conditions ty'd, And I do trust she is my own for this: By this she may: but if she more require, There's nothing in the world I will deny'r. With hasty journey he is homeward bound. Leaving the vulgar to the nine days wonder: Arriving safely on the English ground, Posting to her, suppos'd too long asunder: Whom with more joy his chearful looks behold, Than can by pen, or lines of ink be told, A woodcut illustration appears here in the text with the following caption: In France all Knights of Christendom, To win a Princess, meet: Guy conquers all, and wins the prize, Then doth his Goddess greet. CANTO IV. With the rewards of Victory Guy doth his Love present, But Phælice is not satisfi'd: Him forth again she sent. In the supposed Heaven of repose, Hope casteth Anchor for his Barque to ride: With kind salute unto his Love he goes; Who gives embracement, and all things beside Befit Affection; all such Complements As Love can look for, gracious she presents. Fair Foe (quoth Guy), I come to challenge thee, For there's no man that I can meet will fight; I have been where a Crew of Cowards be, Not one that dares maintain a Ladies right: Good proper fellows of their tongues, and tall, That let me win a Princess from them all. Phælice, this sword hath won an Emp'rors Daughter, As sweet a Wench as lives in Europe's space: At price of blows, and bloody wounds I bought her, Well worth my bargain; but thy better face Hath made me leave her to some others Lot; For, I protest by Heaven, I love her not. This stately Steed, this Faulcon and these Hounds, I took, as in full payment of the rest: For I will keep my love within the bounds That do inclose the compass of my brest: My constancy to thee is all my care, Leaving all other Women as they are. But Sweet-heart, tell me, shall I have thee now; Wilt thou consent the Priest shall do his part? Art thou resolved still to keep thy Vow? Is none but I half with thee in thy heart? Canst thou forsake the world, change Maiden-life, And help thy faithful Lover to a Wife? Quoth Phælice, Worthy Knight, my joys are great, To understand thy honourable deeds: It seems some were in such a bloody sweat, Their Valour, Fame and Reputation bleeds: I give thee humble thanks, that for my sake Such hard Adventures didst vouchsafe to take. To win a Princess was a precious prize; But sure, methinks, if I had been Sir Guy, She should have found more favour in mine eyes, Than take a Horse, and turn a Lady by. What, is a Horse, a Faulcon, and a Hound, More worthy than a Lady so renown'd? Perhaps you'l say, 'tis done for love of me; I do imagine, nay, believe it so. And though I jest, I will do more for thee, Than thou, or any but my self doth know. I'le never marry while life's glass doth run, But only thee, or I will die a Nun. But give me leave to speak my mind (kind Love) Let me lock up my secrets in thy brest. I had a Vision did affection move, Cupid came to me in my quiet rest, And did command me, in his Mothers name, To love thee. Thus perswading to the same, An armed man (just as I see thee now) He set before me, speaking to me thus. Phælice, be gentle-hearted, yielding, bow, Do not oppose against the power of us; But all thy love, thy loyalty and truth, Bestow it freely on this matchless youth. Throughout the world his Fame shall be admired, And mighty men shall tremble at his wrath. To end Kings quarrels, he shall be required, His worthiness shall tread no common path. But actions to be fear'd, he shall effect Matters of moment, things of great respect. This (in effect) he did to me relate, And I have been obedient to his will. Now if I would, I know not how to hate; Of perfect kindness I am taught the skill. Believe me, Guy, for if it were not so, This secret of my heart thou shouldst not know. But now, my Love, before thou dost possess Thy constant Phælice in her Marriage-bed, Thou must do deeds of greater worthyness, Than winning of a Lady with her Steed. I'le ever love thee, though I ne're do more, But will not grant thee use of love before. Not grant me use of love (quoth he) fair Friend! Why then of force I must abroad again. I will content thee, or I'le make an end One way or other, slay, or else be slain. Ere I return again into this Realm, Thou shalt confess I have fulfill'd thy Dream, Assist me Heavens, as I mean upright; For I protest by all the powers Divine, No unjust Quarrel shall procure me fight, To wrong the wronged I will ne're incline; But stand for those that by oppression fall, In Honor's venture; be it life and all. Come my Bellona, do thou gird my sword, Embrace my Armour in thy Ivory Arms, And such kind kisses as thou canst afford, Bestow upon me in the stead of Charms. I think upon Ulysses loving Wife, How thou art now to imitate her life. Farewel, my Phælice, health and happiness Attend thee ever, to thy hearts desire. And I beseech God grant me like success, As I resolve my love to thee intire, At my return, when Mars his bus'ness ends, My comfort is, Hymen will make amends. And so unto Earl Roband he repairs, And tells him, he is come to take his leave; He must seek out where Honour dealeth shares, To purchase that which worthy men receive. At home (saith he) my honourable Lord, I find that Valour nothing can afford; Therefore I'le search abroad what's to be done, From Countrey unto Kingdom I'le resort, By Nature's course my Glass hath much to run; I well may spare some years for fighting sport; Of idleness there's nothing comes but evil, I hate a Coward as I hate the Devil. Guy (quoth the Earl) thou mak'st me grieve at this, The news is more than I can well indure, Thy wished company so soon to miss, When I did make account I had been sure Possest of thee, at thy late travels end; And dost thou now Journeys anew intend? Remain with me, trust not to fortunes pow'r; Though now she hath so well and kindly dealt, She may allot thee an unlucky hour, That instantly her Favours so have felt. Her coutesies are most unconstant things, Believe her not, she dealeth false with Kings. Triumphant on her wheel now thou dost sit, And with Fame's Triumph thy glory doth remain, Oh! do not over-rashly hazard it; Lost honour is not eas'ly got again. May not one cursed and unhappy blow Betray thy self to thy insulting Foe? May not a Monster, or a savage beast, At unawares deprive thee of thy breath? May not a Tyrant when thou thinkest least, Cut off thy course by an untimely death? May not a thousand dangers on thee light, Where but thy self, thy wronged self must right? (Quoth Guy) My Lord, danger he may not fear, That to Adventures doth himself dispose; He must a mind of resolution bear, And think himself too good for all his foes; I'le never dread I shall be over man'd While I have hands to fight, or legs to stand. Therefore in humble fort I leave your honour, Wishing all health unto your happy state. If Fortune take a frowning mood upon her, Why, she shall see I will disdain her hate. What star soever sway'd when I was born, I have a mind will laugh mis hap to scorn, CANTO V Guy to the Duke of Lovain goes, And joyns with him in strength Against the Emperor Reyner, Then makes his peace at length. Now Guy expects a favourable gail, Which to his hearts desire he doth attain; And with a speedy passage he doth fail, To seek Adventures out in in France again; Where finding none, from thence away he hies To Lovain, where in siege the Emp'ror lies. For Segwin Duke of Lovain's hap was such, At Turnament a Noble-man to kill, The Emperor's cousin, whom he loved much, And took the death of him exceeding ill; So that a quarrel thereupon arose, And Wars ensu'd betwixt two mighty foes. Thither goes Guy to lend the Duke his aid, But in the way an accident besel; For by Duke Otton he was false betray'd, And's life in question, which he freed well, Otton in France before disgrac'd by Guy, Had vow'd where e're he met him he should die. And to that end, sixteen appointed were To lye in ambush, and surprize him so; All men of resolution, void of fear, That in a Forest did themselves bestow, And set on Guy, only with three Knights more, The like distress he ne're was in before. Now Gentlemen, and loving Friends (quoth he), Shew your selves English hearted, rightly bred. Here is some odds, sixteen unto you three; But I the fourth will stand you in some stead; You three shall combat six, that's two for one; And with the other ten let me alone. Wherewith he drew his sword, and laid about, That ratling Armour eccho'd in the skye; Dealing so resolute amongst the rout, That down they drop on every side, and die. Here lyeth one that hath no legs to stand, And there another wanting head and hand, Guy quickly made dispatch of his half score, He was not long in ridding them away: But then remained half a dozen more, Which two of his most worthy Knights did slay; When he perceiv'd them fall, he stampt the ground, And utter'd forth this fearful angry sound: Ah villains! how my soul abhors this sight: For these how my tevenging passion strives: This bloody deed with blood I will requite. You die for it, had each a thousand lives. Two slain out-right, and Heraud wounded too, Is the last cursed Act that you shall do. With force (as 'twere exceeding humane strength) He lays upon them blows to stagger under, And brought them breathless to the ground, at length Cut all in piece-meal for the Crows asunder: There lye (quoth he) and feast Fowls of the Air, Or feed those savage beasts that will repair. But these sweet Gentlemen that have resign'd Their dearest Lives for the defence of me, And came from England, as their Love inclin'd, Companions in my hardest haps to be; I will inter in honourable wise, With best solemnity I can devise, From thence unto a Hermit, dwelling nigh, He rode, and did commit that charge with care, Who did perform that office carefully, And Heraud home unto his Cell he bare; Who was not dead, though Guy suppos'd him slain, But by the Hermet was restor'd again. Now forth goes Guy, pensive, perplexed, sad, Grieving that Destiny so cruel dealt; For left alone, no company he had, To ease the torments that in heart he felt: Till travelling along, at last he found A place for honour very much renown'd. There did he meet with Tilt and Turnament, And entertain both glory and delight; There fortune yielded him her full consent To win the best of every valiant Knight: Of all the worthy men that did resort, Not one could match him in Duke Reyner's Court. Then to the Duke of Millain he repairs, Where for his worth he is admir'd of all: And understanding that some great affairs 'Twixt Segwin Duke of Lovain did befall, And th' Emperor; Millain he did forsake, And towards Lovain did his journey take, As he did pass upon the way, he meets A Pilgrim, that with travel seemed faint: Whom in all human courtesies he greets, And with some news entreats him to acquaint His longing ear; he with a sigh or two Said, Sir, with news I little have to do. One thing in all this world is all my care, And only that, and nothing else I mind; I seek a man, and seek him in despair; Because I long have sought, and cannot find. A man more dearly to my souls love ty'd, Than all the men are in the world beside. Why, what art thou, quoth Guy, or who is he? Of kindness be so kind, as tell in brief, I am an English man of Knights degree, (Quoth Heraud) and the subject of my grief, Is loss of one Sir Guy, my Countrey-man, Guy with joys tears lights to embrace him then. And art thou living, Heraud, my dear freind (Quoth he)? and kindly took him in his arms. Then cheerfully let sorrows all take end, And let me know who cur'd thee of thy harms? The good old Hermit by his skill did save me, With wholsome Medicines and Salves he gave me. Guy did rejoyce; and Heraud's joys abound At this so good and happy accident; No angry Star in opposition frown'd. But each was owner of his own content: So posting with good fortune on their side, Unto the Duke of Lovain they do ride. The City in distress besieg'd they find, And very small resistance could be made; But Segwin was right joyful in his mind, That worthy Guy was come unto his aid. For now (quoth he) boldly presume I can, We have an honourable valiant man. Advise me, warlike Knight, what's to be done, To free the present danger we are in? My Lord (quoth Guy), there's freedom to be won; Ev'n by a course my self will first begin: Let's issue forth upon them presently, Our Courages will make the Cowards fly: I'le give consent to any thing thou wilt, Thy project willingly I do approve: Let limb be lost, let life and blood be spilt, All follow thee, that comes to me in love, Open the Gates, let's beat them from our Walls: He lies no lower than the ground, that falls. Then suddenly the City they forsake, And on the Almains resolutely set, Where such a bloody slaughter they did make, That many thousand lives paid Death his debt, Of thirty thousand that in Siege there lay, Scarce thirty hundred that escap'd away. The Emperor at this was much agrieved, And with new forces gave a new assault, Knowing the City could not be relieved, And then their strength would weaken by default. So comes upon them with a fresh supply, Thinking at length to famish them thereby. Guy and the Duke upon the Walls appear, And tell him he shall never win the Town: For they can spare their Soldiers much good cheer, Throwing them Victuals in abundance down: Intreating them, if they want more than that, To speak, they shall have store to make them fat. But now quoth Guy, your Bodies are well fed, How do you feel your Stomachs to go fight? I am afraid you are not rightly bred, But Dunghils, that will sooner crow than bite; For still when Cowards do begin a fray, Look e're it ends, to see them run away; And so your selves have lately done we see, Your tounges we heard, but hands there's no man feels: Most hot to brabble and contend you be, But wondrous quick and nimble at your heels. We did suspect when you came here to forage, We should have been incumbred with your courage. But it's not so, alas you're not the men, Unless perhaps asleep you should us catch; For waking we'l encounter one for ten, And never wish to have a better match: Have at you once again, sit fast, we come, March on my hearts, sound trumpet, strike up drum: Upon the sudden with the Foe they be, Fighting like men that laught pale death to scorn, Resolved now they would their City free, Or never live to see the next day morn. Much blood was shed, great store of lives it cost, And on the Almains side the day was lost. The Duke, with Guy, pursue their foes in chase; Who like so many Hares away do fly, Wishing that they had wings to mend their pace; So sweet is life to them that fear to die. But Fortune in an angry doom decreed, Their glory, honour, fame and life should bleed: The Victors to the City then retired, With Trophies of triumphant glory won; And all that heard the Action much admired The great exploit so resolutely done: But unto Guy the Duke all thanks did yield; For thou quoth he) art Cæsar of our field My Lord (quoth Guy), I joy not half so much, That we have wrought a freedom by the sword, As I should glory, if my hap were such, 'Twixt you and th' Emperor to make accord: Give me but leave, I will endeavour it; And put good will to a blunt Soldiers Wit. The Duke consents with thanks, and doth intreat Him take a guard of Soldiers forth the Town; Danger that seems but little, may prove great, I would not have thee wrong'd for Reyners Crown Go honourable man, what thou shalt do, I'le set my hand, my heart, my life thereto. Guy goes unto the Emperor, speaks thus: High Majesty, all health unto thy Grace, And peace to thee, if thou say peace to us; And love to thee, if thou wilt love embrace: As we are Christians, let us War no more, But fight 'gainst such as will not God adore, We sue to thee not in a servile manner, As dreading any power or force thou hast; For Victory doth now display his banner, And War yields us a sweet and pleasant tast; No cause doth move it, but a Conscience cause, To bring the Heathens to Religious Laws. Speak Reyner, and resolve, what wilt thou do? With Soldiers brevity my Message ends; Give me an Answer, ev'n as brief hereto: Shall we be Christians Foes, or Christian Friends? Shall we among our selves the Name divide? Or challenge them that have the same deni'd? Brave English man! hadst thou spoke thus before, Thousands, quoth he, had liv'd which now are slain; Earth should have wanted of that slaughter'd store Which doth in her vast bowels now remain: Thou hast prvail'd with me, hot War shall cease, And I embrace thee as a friend in piece, Thy motion tends to Honour, Honour's Knight, And thou shalt live in Fame's immortal praise, When thou art buried in eternal night, Thy name shall last the longest length of days. Thou dost the Worthies of the world exceed, Blest be the Countrey did thy person breed. Come, go my Liege (quoth Guy) unto the Town, And to Duke Segwin there a League renew: Our end shall be to pull the Pagans down, That unto Christ's Religion are untrue. My greatest joy will be to hear it said, This is the best days work that e're Guy made. CANTO VI. Guy with a thousand chosen men, against the Pagans goes, And makes them curse that e're they felt the force of Christian blows. The power of peace hath vanquisht stubborn War, And mighty Princes worthily conclude, The sword shall rust in sheath before it jar, To be with blood of Innocents imbrew'd: Christians in Name and Actions to unite, 'Gainst unbelieving Infidels to fight. Guy with a thousand men doth take his leave, To hearken further after Martial news, And doth a true intelligence receive, That barb'rous Pagans, Sarazens and Jews, Turks, and the like, of Mahomet's blind Crew, In most confused War each others slew. To them he goes, partial on neither part, His sword did favour every side alike, They all were odious to him in his heart; Which arm'd his hand with vigour for to strike, And work amazement unto their contending. Coming so roughly to their quarrels ending, Qouth they amongst themselves, What fellow's this, That lays about him like a mad man thus? Of certainty, more than a man he is; For human force would fear to fight with us: But if he be, as seemeth by his shape, Had he ten thousand lives he should not scape. Then did a haughty Pagan step to Guy, And said to him, if Valour in thee rest, Let's have a little sport 'twixt thee and I, Only to see which of our Swords cuts best: Thou hast a weapon there like to a Reed: Methinks it is too blunt to make one bleed. Too blunt (quoth Guy)! and in his anger groans. Pagan, I fike thy humour passing well. I'le whet it, e're we part, upon thy bones, And then another tale thou wilt me tell; If it should fail me now, it were a wonder, Such Lubbers it hath often hew'd in sunder. But come, art ready? Bid thy friends adieu, And fay thy Prayers unto thy Pagan Gods; For I do mean to use thee like a Jew, Because with Christians thou dost stand at odds; Look that thy head be set on sure and fast, Or, mortal man, I'le prove thee but a blast. Then did they lend each other lufty knocks, That sparks of fire did from their Helmets fly: The Martial multitude about them flocks, Expecting all the end and death of Guy: For Colbrond, whom he fought withal, was strong, And had been Champion to the Pagans long. At length Guy lent him such a speedy blow, That down comes Colbrond and his strength to ground. Pagan (quoth he), is my sword sharp or no, With which even now such a blunt fault you found? Rise quick, for if thy legs thou canst not feel, Off goes thy head as sure as this is steel. Forthwith he made him shorter by the head, And that unto the Emperor he sent. The Infidels grew all astonished, For they in Colbrond were so confident, They durst have ventured goods, and life, and limb, On any Combat that was fought by him, Then Heraud (to give Guy some breathing space) Challeng'd a Pagan, called Elmadant; And dar'd him, and defi'd him to his face; (For Valiant Heraud did no courage want) The Pagan somewhat hot with fury fill'd, Did combat, being quickly cool'd and kill'd. Presently Guy unto another comes, Call'd Morgadour, and soundly with his blade Lays on him, and his senses so benums, He tumbles head-long like a tired Jade: The Pagans seeing their Champions thus go down, Forsook the Field, retiring to the Town. Where a most bloody Tyrant bare the sway, Who hearing what had hapned, full of ire, Went armed to the Tent whereas Guy lay, And did a Combat at his hands require. Villain (quoth he) whom like a Dog I scorn, I'le make thee curse the time that thou wast born. Now Runnagate, I come to fetch thy head, For to a Lady I have promis'd it; My Curs shall with thy English flesh be fed, They must devour thy body every bit: Come, I have vow'd by Mahomet thou di'st, Thou canst not scape by trusting in thy Christ. And hast thou giv'n away my head (quoth he) Unto a Lady? 'tis a brave intent; An honest man will his Words-Master be, And never promise more than he hath meant: Come on thy ways, and take it quickly off, Or else the Lady will suppose you scoff. With proud disdain together then they rush, Laying it on as fast as they could drive; But Eskeldart Guy's sword did so becrush, That for his head no longer durst he strive; But on the sudden for to save his own, Put spurs to horse, and in all post is gone. Guy then returns to Heraud, and declares What a bold fellow came to fetch his head: Who smiling at it, merrily prepares To tell of his adventures, how he sped With a false Coward called Addellart, That wounded him with an envenom'd Dart, And being hurt most dangerously so, Was intercepted e're he could retire By Estellard, a proud insulting Foe, Compos'd of cruelty, of devilish ire. But (quoth Sir Heraud) e're our fray was done, I made them wish it never had begun. For Addellart I wounded in the side, And Estellard I cur-tail'd by the knees: Then left them lying, Death to be their guide Unto the Jayl where worms do claim their fees. So when these two were seen to fall down dead, All t'other Pagans with amazement fled. Why then (quoth Guy) all's quiet I perceive; The Miscreants like unto Foxes lye; But gentle Heraud, e're we take our leave, One Combat more I am resolv'd to try: The General of this accursed Rout, Shall be the man I mean to single out. They term him mighty Soldan: Friend, I long To make a proof, if he deserve the name; I am in doubt they do him mighty wrong, If might be wanting to avouch the same: Titles of worth become base Cowards ill, I'le try what's in him, hap whatever will. Nay Heraud, leave me, prithee do forbear. I will be speedy, tarry in this Wood: Go to your grassy bank, repose thee there, And with this balsom stay those drops of blood. E're Phœbus in the Occident decline, Death shall conclude the Soldans life or mine. Said Heraud; Since thou wilt not let me go, But durst appoint this bed of Earth to bear me; Till thou return, I will converse with wo, And will not suffer any Bird sing near me. With longing eyes, and careful listning ears, I'le spend thy absent time in prayers and tears, Guy posts with speed, and doth the Souldan find, And thus he speaks, Art thou the man of Might, Sirnamed so by tongues, and peoples wind? Here is a Christian comes to dare thee fight: Both Mahomet and thee I do defie, And here's a sword I will maintain it by! The Souldan with a staring look replies, Thou Christian slave, I'le chastise thee with steel, Thou art an odious creature in mine eyes, And thy presumption shall my fury feel. With that at Guy he ran with all his force, Their Launces brake, and each forsook his Horse. Then by the Sword the Victor must prevail, Which manly force makes deadly wounds withal, Cutting through Armour, mangling shirts of Mail, That at the last down did the Souldan fall, Sending blasphemous curses to the skye, And casting handfuls of his blood at Guy. Who presently took horse, and then retir'd To Heraud, whom he found in slumber laid; Rise Friend (quoth he), the time is now expir'd, An end with mighty Souldan I have made. With that he rose with joy and Loves embrace, And forth they travel to another place. CANTO VII. Guy takes a Princely Lyon's part and doth a Dragon kill; Then frees fair Osile from mishaps, that else had fared ill. Passing the Desart now, where shady trees Embrac'd each other in their green-leave arms; Where Lady Eccho's dwelling best agrees, And little birds sing fearless of their harms, They chanc'd to find a silver streaming spring, Which water to them was a pleasant thing. A woodcut illustration appears here in the text with the following caption: His Lady sends him forth again, Whose will he doth obey, And manfully a Dragon kills, To part a cruel fray. There with the crystal streams they cool their heat, And slake their thirst they had endured long; There did they make the herbs and roots their meat, To satisfie for Nature's hungry wrong: But on a sudden at a noise they wonder, A Lyon roar'd as if great Jove did thunder. Heraud (quoth Guy), to horse let's be prepar'd, And leave our dinner till another day; Here is a sound, I never was so scar'd, I'le seek it out, it comes from yonder-way: Some Monster, or some Devil makes a noise, For on my life it is no human voice, So forth he rides, and underneath a hill, He finds a Dragon with a Lyon met: Brave sport (said he) I pray fight on your fill, And then upon the strongest I will set: Which of the twain that first aside doth start, I am a friend that will maintain his part. The Dragon winds his crooked knotted tail About the Lyon's legs, to cast him so, The Lyon fastens on his rugged scale, And nimbly doth avoid that overthrow: Then tooth and nail, they cruelly tear and bite, Maintaining long a fierce and bloody fight. At last the Lyon faintly turns a side: And looks about, as if he would be gone: Nay then (quoth Guy) Dragon have at your hide, Defend thy Devils face, I'le lay it on. With that couragiously to work he goes, And deals the Dragon very manly blows. The ugly beast, with flaggy wings display'd, Comes at him manly, with most dreadful paws, Whose very looks might make a man afraid, So terrible seem'd his devouring jaws: Wide gaping, grisly, like the mouth of hell, More horrible than pen or tongue can tell. His blazing eyes did burn like living fire, And forth his smoaking gorge came sulphur smoke: Aloft his speckled breast he lifted higher Than Guy could reach at length of weapons stroke; Thus in most ireful mood himself he bore, And gave a cry as Seas are wont to rore. With that his mortal sting he stretched out, Exceeding far the sharpest point of steel; Then turns and winds his scaly tail about The Horses legs, more nimble than an Eel: With that Guy hews upon him with his blade, And three mens strength to every stroke he laid. One fatal blow he gave him in the side, From thence did issue streams of swarthy blood; The sword had made the passage broad and wide, That deep into the Monster's gore Guy stood: Then with a second blow he overtook him, Which made the Dragon turn to have forsook him. Nay then, quoth he, thou hast not long to live, I see thou faintest at the Point to fall; Then such a stroke of death he did him give, That down came Dragon, crying out withall So horrible, the sound did more affright The Conqueror, than all the dreadful fight. Away he rides, and lets that Hell-hound lie; But looking back, espies behind his Horse The Lyon coming after very nigh, Which makes him light to follow manly force; But when the Beast beheld his weapon drawn, He came to him, and like a dog did fawn. Like to that grateful Lyon which did free Androdus life, for pulling out a thorn, When by offence he should by Laws decree, Within a Theater by beasts be torn; The Lyon came, and lick'd him very kind, Bearing (as seem'd) an old good turn in mind. Ev'n so this gentle creature deals with him, For that same benefit which he had done; Although by Nature cruel, fierce and grim, Yet like a Spaniel by his horse did run; Continuing many days with great desire, Till extream hunger forc'd him to retire. Now towards the Sea Guy doth his journey take, Imbarques for France, but by contrary wind Arrives in Almain, where the Nobles make Great triumph for him, and with joyful mind; The Emperor rejoyces that he's come, And bids him welcome into Christendom. There is he entertain'd with Turnament, With Kingly banquets, Princely Revelling: And multitudes to give their eyes content, Attend him with their throng, still wondering At all his worthy Acts report had spread, Where with their ears most strangely had been fed. From thence he travels towards his loving friend The Duke of Lovain, whom he long'd to see; But e're he came unto his journeys end, A wronged Lady he did worth'ly free; Which violently was from her love bereft And he at point of death sore wounded left. Thus it befel, Terry a valiant Earl With his dear Love, sirnam'd Osile the fair, (His precious Jem, inestimable Pearl) Into a Forest went to take the air; Whereas a plot was laid to take his life, And make his beauteous Love anothers wife. Upon the sudden sixteen Villains came Unto the Earl, and did him grievous wound. Sirrah (quoth one) thou hast a wench we claim, She must with us, lye thou there on the ground, And the next passenger that thou dost see, Intreat him make a grave to bury thee. Guy finding Terry thus, hearing his plaint, Doth comfort him in kindest sort he can: Who with the loss of blood doth weakly faint, With force of deadly choler pale and wan: Courage (quoth he) I'le fetch thy Love again, Or say that Guy is but a Coward Swain. When Terry heard that name, he did revive, For unto Guy his worthy deeds were known: And lifting up himself front ground, did strive For to embrace him in deep passions groan. Thanks gracious Heavens (quoth he) with soul and heart, For sending thee to take my wronged part. Which is the way (quoth he) those villians went? That path, said woful Terry by yon Oak: Have after them, this deed they shall repent, As I'm a Christian Knight; and as he spoke, He heard a shriek, Which was the Ladies cry. So by that sound he did them soon discry: Coming unto them, Wretched slaves (quoth he) What do you purpose with this Lady here? Inlarge her presently, and set her free, You have done wrongs that will be rated dear; Her Husband wounded, she us'd violent Will cost your lives a price incontinent. With that they laugh'd and said, what fool's this same, Or rather mad-man in his desperate mind, That means by wilful death to get a name, And have the world report he hath been kind? The fellow sure is in some frantick fit, And means to fight, without both fear and wit. Like so (quoth he) the fit that's on me now, You shall all find to be a raging one, With that he shews them Mars his angry brow, And bids the Lady cease her pensive moan: Saying, Good Madam, unto joy incline, For suddenly the Rascals will be mine. Then with a courage admirable bold, At every blow some one or other dies: Which when the gentle Lady did behold, Oh pity! worthy Knight, she crys; These mortal wounds I can no longer see; Be not so bloody in revenging me. Upon my knees I do intreat thee stay, This is to me a terrifying sight: Oh! with their lives thou takest mine away; If one die more, I faintly yield my sp'rite. Thou worthily mine honour hast defended, Let the revenging of my wrongs be ended. Lady (quoth he) I cease at your request, Depart base Rascals, all but two, be gone: But Villians, you did bind her for the rest, And struck them with his sword (the scabbard on) That down to ground they fell, making this 'scuse, My Lord we only kept her for thy use. Then on his Steed he lets the Lady ride, To seek her Lord, whom she had left distrest: And Guy unto that place became her guide; Where coming, they did find him careful drest: For in their absence came a Hermit by, Which to his bleeding wounds did salve apply. Terry and Osile, in their joys abound, And gratefully to Guy all things do give: Be thou (said they) in life and death renown'd, Whom we will honour, while we breathing live; Hold, here's my hand (quoth Terry) worthy Guy, In fight for thee, I will be proud to die. CANTO VIII. Guy takes Earl Terries Fathers part, and kills the duke his foe. With Sword destroys a cruel Boar. prevailing danger so. Now Titans Horses with his fiery Carr, Had brought the day to darkness in the West, And Vesper, the silver shining Starr, Which doth adorn the Skies at evening best Appear'd as bright as Cynthia in her Sphere, To welcome sable-nights approaching near. When Terry, Guy and Osile wanting guide, Did stay about the unfrequenting Wood, Hearing the Savage noise on every side, Of Beasts that thirsted after human blood, As Boars, and Bears, and Lyons, and the like, Which to their hearts did some amazement strike. On every side they cast a heedful eye, Still doubting on a sudden, some surprise; At length two armed men they did espy, That also listen to those fearful cries, Each had his sword in hand, being ready drawn, Knowing that place did yield no dogs would fawn, Coming more near, Sir Heraud was the one, The other even as dearly Terry's friend, Who with embracements made their gladness known, And then the Earl demanded to what end His loving Cousin pass'd the desart so? My Lord (quoth he) to bring the news of wo. Thy noble Father is besieged now In his strong Castle, by Duke Ottens Power; Who hath Protested by a solemn vow, About his ears he will pull down the Tower, In a revenge that thou his Love hast got, He swears thy Father's life escapeth not. His Love (quoth Terry) prithee Osile speak, Acquaint this worthy man with thy souls thought Have I procur'd thee any faith to break? Or been the instigator unto ought That is unjust in righteous Heavens sight? Ever, (quoth Osile) thou hast been upright. That wretch would force my love from thee away, In claiming that I ne're intend to give; I will be thine until my dying day, Thou shalt enjoy me all the hours I live: And when I alter this determination, Let God and man hold me in destation. Well spoke (said Guy) Lady be constant ever, And honour's blemish then thou needst not doubt; Keep Love's foundation firm, alter it never, It is for Love I range the World about: And do expose my life to mortal danger In this exiled state, an unknown stranger. But Terry, wherefore are thy looks so sad? Thou hast thy Love in person to embrace; As far as England mine is to be had, And many years I have not seen her face: It were enough to bring my hopes to end, But that my patience is a trusty friend. My Lord (saith Terry) know you not my grief, And heard this messenger relate the cause? Oh my distressed Father wants relief! I were a Rebel unto Nature's Laws, Not to condole with him in his extream, Making his trouble my true sorrows Theam. If that be all (quoth he) thou art to blame, There is no cause to spend a sigh thereon: I'le terrifie Duke Otten with my name, Let him but hear I come, and he'l be gone. Something between us may not be forgot, He felt my sword in France, but lik'd it not. Since that, against my life a plot he laid, By Villains that surpriz'd me in a wood, But treachery with vengeance was repaid; Who ever knew a Traitor's end prove good; Accursed haps attend them evermore: In Brazen Bull Perillus did first roar. I will go with thee to defend thy Father, (For the oppressed I have vow'd to right) And reason moveth it, so much the rather Mine own abuses therewith to requite: This opportunity we'l not omit, In that occasion falleth out so fit. Let's hasten on with speed unto the place, Preventing mischeif e're too far it run, Take hold on Time before he turns his face, Good proveth best, when it is soonest done; Go like Eneas with a filial joy, To fetch thine old Anchises out of Troy. Couragious Knight (quoth Terry) thy bold heart Connot be daunted, I perceive, with fear; Compos'd with Mars his Element thou art, Of powerful limbs, to manage sword and spear; My Melancholy thou hast banish'd hence, And with strong hope arm'd me in recompence. Now all in post they speed themselves away, And in short time unto the Castle come, Wheereas Duke Otten and his forces lay, Relying on his Souldiers ample summe; But when the Captains of Guy's coming knew, They fled by night, and never bad adieu. This was discouragement to all the rest, To see their Leaders thus give ground and flie. Yet the Duke most resolute protest, If each man in the Castle were a Guy, He would not leave it basely and retire; Though life be dear, yet honours place is higher. Terry (quoth Guy) we must not tedious be; Experience often hath my Tutor been, And taught, that when advantage I do see, To fasten on occasion and begin; The enemy by fear himself subdues, Add force to that, and victory ensues. We will not make our prison in this place, As long as there is field-room to be got; 'Tis my desire to meet the Duke's good Grace, And combat him, because he loves me not, If that you will not leave this house of stone, I'le leave you all, and go myself alone. And with these words Heraud and he depart, Which when the Castle-soldiers did perceive, They gave a shout, Our General thou art, Thy honourable steps we will not leave; We are resolved to attend thee still, Let Fortune use us, e'en as fortune will. And thus most valiant they do march along, Giving the onset, fearless to their foe; Making those multitudes that seem so strong, Retire themselves with slaughtered overthrow; But when the Duke perceiv'd his Soldiers flye, Perish (quoth he) base Villians, here I'le dye. Where is this English man that haunts my Ghost, And thus pursueth me from place to place? I challenge him to come and leave the Host, And meet with resolution face to face: Let equal envy make his equal match, All controversies we will soon dispatch. Agreed (quoth Guy) proud Foe, I yield consent: Repent thy wrongs, and make thy conscience clear; For thou hast liv'd to see thy honour spent, Which worthy men of all things hold most dear: The noble-minded censure him with shame That lives to see the death of his good name. Then toward each other they did manly make, And break their Launces very violent; Which being done, their swords in hand they take, Fighting untill great store of blood was spent: For envy did the Duke's keen weapon whet; And on Guy's sword revenge an edge did set; At length through loss of blood the Duke fell down And said, Now fond felicity farewel; I am betray'd by Fortune's angry frown, And this experience to the world doth tell, There's nothing constant that the Earth contains, Death deals with Monarchs, as with simple Swains. Bewitching vanities, seducing blind us, Greatness hath great accounts thereon depending: As Death doth leave us, so shall Judgment find us, There is no peace unto a happy ending: My dying hour yields more repenting grace, Than in my life I ever could embrace. Th' immortal soul doth with these words depart, And leaves the breathless body did contain it: While woful passions do afflict Guy's heart, Now wishing to himself he had not slain it: For true humilty compassion shows, To see affliction over burden woes. Guy sheath'd his sword, and said, remain thou there Until I do arrive on Englands shore; No further quarrel to the world I bear, For love of Phælice I will bleed no more; From her I have been too too long away, And will return to challenge Soldiers pay. So thence he rode to find Sir Heraud out, Making his journey through a desart place, Which was obscure, environ'd roundabout With shady trees that hid bright Phœbus face, Where suddenly he met the hugest Boar, That ever mortal eyes beheld before. The Beast came at him most exceeding fell, Which he perceiving, stands upon his guard, And doth avoid those dreadful Tusks right well, Laying upon his swinish head so hard, That dead he left him, who had many slain, For forth that Wood no man came back again. When this was done, Heraud he overtakes, And tells him what a Christmas Brawn he slew, Then with his purpose him acquainted makes, Which was to bid all foreign parts adieu, And see the heavenly object of his heart; Heraud consents, and they forthwith depart. CANTO IX. To England comes victorious Guy and doth fair Phælice wed; At York, presenting Athelstone a dreadful Dragons head. Assisted now by nimble winged Time, Guy shapes his course for England, and doth leave The bold adventures of each foreign Clime, Love's just reward from Phælice to receive: As Hercules twelve labours being past, Found time for Dianert's love at last. Heraud and Guy no sooner do arrive, But news thereof unto the King was brought. Who heard of all before they did atchieve; Which made him much desirous in his thought To see such subjects, matchless men alone, In honouring England, and King Athelstone. To York they go, for there the King was then, To whom they did most humble duty show; Welcome (quoth he) renowned Martial men; My Princely love upon you I bestow; Your fortunate success contentment breeds, Fame came before and brought us home your deeds. Guy, thou hast laid a heavy hand we hear Upon the necks of Pagans, Infidels, And sent them home by fatal Sword and Spear, To horrors vault, where unbelievers dwell; Devouring Beasts thou likewise hast destroy'd, That human Creatures fearful have annoy'd. Yet worthy man, I think thou ne'r did slay, Of all those Monsters terrible and wild, A creature more cruel, than at this day Destroys what e're he meets, man, woman, child, Cattle and all, which no man may withstand, A dreadful Dragon in Northumberland. I speak not this to animate thee on, And hazard life at setting foot on shore; For divers to destroy this beast have gone, But to their Friends never returned more: No, I express how happy thou hast been, To free like fears that other men were in. Dread Lord (quoth he) as I am English Knight, And faithful unto God, true to my King. I will go see if that same beast dare bite, For to your Grace his head I mean to bring: I found his fellow with a Lyon fighting, And made him leave both scratching and his biting. And as I dealt with him, I'le deal with this: Only I do beseech your Royal Grace, Command me some direction where he is, And to your Court I'le bring his ugly face, Or your mild savour let me never see; Dragon or Devil whatsoe're he be. So taking humble leave, away he rides Unto Northumberland, to find the beast; Having a dozen Knights which were his guides, And brought him where the Dragon held his feast Like Canibal, that feeds on flesh of men: Behold (quoth they to Guy) yon Cave's his Den. It is enough, said he, do you remain, And leave me to go find out Hidra's head, That never shall devour a man again, Who with so many bodies have been fed: Here Gentlemen if you will please to stay, Sit on your Horses, and behold our fray. Coming unto the Cave, the Dragon spies him, And forth he stalks with lofty speckled brest Of dreadful form: as soon as ere Guy eyes him, His Launce he speedy set unto his wrest; Then spurs to Horse, and then at Dragon makes, That bearing ground at the encounter shakes. Then very lightly Guy returns his Horse, And comes upon him with redoubled might: The Dragon meets him with resisting force, And like a Reed, his Launce in two did bite: Nay then (quoth Guy) if to such bites you fall, I have a tool to pick your teeth withal. Then drew his Sword (a keen and massie blade) And fiercely struck with furious blows so fell, That many wide and bloody wounds he made, Which caus'd the Dragon yawn, like mouth of hell; Roaring aloud with a most hideous sound, And with his claws, all rent and tore the ground. Impatient of the smart he did sustain, He thought with wings to raise himself aloft, But with a stroke Guy brought him down again, And ply'd him with the edge of steel so oft, That down he fell in dirty blood bewray'd; And forth his wide devouring Oven bewray'd: A slake of fire seemed to issue thence, While Guy was hewing off his ugly head. Now fiend (quoth he) thou hast thy recompence For all the human blood thy jaws have shed; Upon a part of this same broken spear, Thy filthy face unto the King I'le bear. The Knights (with joy exceeding) take a view Of that same fearful creature, strange of shape: Admiring at his ugly form of hiew, With wonderment, that mortal could escape Those teeth and claws, so dreadful, sharp and long, Compos'd by nature in a Beast so strong. When they had fix'd the head upon a spear, And measur'd out the bodies length direct: Unto the King at Lincoln, they it bear, Who Guy's return with longing did expect. God shield (quoth he) and save me from all evil, Here is a face may well out-face the Devil. What staring Eyes of burning-glass be those That might (alive) two flaming beacons seem? What scales of Harness arm that crooked nose And teeth? none such had Cerberus I deem; What yawning mouth, and forked tongue is there That being dead, may make the living fear? Victorious Knight, thy actions we admire, And place thee highly in our Kingly love; Throughout the spacious Orb thy Fame aspire, More lofty than the Supream Sphere doth move: To the succeeding ages of thy Land, I will remember thy victorious Hand. Which shall be thus, the Monster's picture wrought On cloth of Arras artificial well; And unto VVarwick we will have it brought, There to remain, and after-ages tell, That worthy Guy, a man of matchless strength, Destroy'd a Dragon thirty foot in length. And place his head here on the Castle wall, For memory, till years do ruin it: And Nobles make triumphant Festival, Afford our Knight all honour doth befit; Troy's Hector's dead, and can no more atcheive, But England's Hector still remains alive. By this report (the only Linguist living) Hath been with Phælice, for to make her glad, Such Fame and Glory to her Lover giving, As never greater any Worthy had; Tells all the deeds of wonder he hath done, From the first action that his hand begun. Phælice impatient of his wished sight, Speeds towards Lincoln, like light Salmacis, Where joyfully she entertains her Knight With Juno's kind embrace, and Venus kiss: Guy with requital makes his gladness known, And in his arms he now enjoys his own. Forgetful Love, and too to slow (quoth she) I fear'd thou didst not mind thy dearest friend; What, seek a Dragon, ere thou look for me; And hazard life, before thou come or send To know if I remain in happy state? Some jealous woman would suppose 'twere hate. But sure I do not, though I speak my heart, And wish I had been first thou saw'st on shore: Guy! Welcome to thy Phælice now thou art: Thou never shalt go forth a fighting more: No, thou hast fought too much, thy looks bewray Stern countenance hath stoln thy smiles away. But love will learn thee (Love) to change thy face; And frame it as at first when I did chuse it; 'Thou hast almost forgotten to embrace; I like that well, it seems thou didst not use it In Foreign parts abroad, where thou hast been; But that lost lesson thou must new begin. I will (quoth he) dear Love, and ply my book, And kiss my Lesson on thy Coral lip: Tell me but only when I am mistook, In reading rashly, if I over-skip, Or be too negligent in taking pain, Why turn me back to conn my gear again. But Lady, one exception I will make, What line soever you do put me to, The Horn book of all other I'le forsake: For willingly I would not have to do With that Cross-row, cross upon many, when Women doth teach it unto married men. Kind Sir (quoth she) content, I'le never chuse it, It fits two sorts, a Courtezan, a Child; Once as the latter simply I did use it, But for the other, rather be beguil'd, Than to deceive, the second Horn-book's naught Teach it not me, and it shall ne're be taught; Guy smil'd and said, then let us Warwick see, Of all the world the place that I love best, Because it had the bringing up of thee; And there first with thy beauty I was blest. I love the Castle, and the Castle-Ground. Where first thy Venus-face alone I found. Let's hasten on to hear this sacred voice, I Guy take Phelice to my wedded Wife; And thou repeat, I likewise am thy choice, Till death depart us, ev'n so long as life: And then the next will be, God give us joy, And send my Fathers Heir a gallant Boy. CANTO IX. The Marriage is solemniz'd, But aftter four days, Guy Penance vows, and Pilgrim like From England goes his ways. The happy day (that Lovers long expect) Is now obtain'd, to give desire rest: And all the honours Hymen can effect, He frank bestows to grace the Wedding feast. For Athelstone and his renowned Queen, At this great Nuptial in their pomp were seen: The Nobles rich and costly attire, With worthy Knights and Gentlemen beside, Ladies of Honour (as their lives require) Attend upon the beautious fair-fac'd Bride. There wanted nothing (wit of man could find) To please the eye, or to content the mind. Masques, mid-night Revels, Tilt and Turnament, Acting of ancient Stories, stately Shows, Banquets might give great Jupiter content; Where Cups of Nectar plenty overflows, Abundant all things, with a plenty hand, As if a King himself should feast the Land. Soon after all these things were consummate, Earl Roband (Phælice worthy Father) dies; And to his Son bequeaths the whole Estate Of Earldom, Lordship, all his Land is Guy's; Who is created Earl of VVarwick then, In Honour's rank, with England's Noble men, But in the Glory of his high applaud, Enjoying all that did partake delight; When every tongue his Fame and Fortune's laud, Himself converts the Sun shine days to night; Bethinking what the world may judge be thought, And deeming all but vain that he had sought. Oft would he sit and meditate alone, In looking back what steps his youth had trod: Then to himself with sighs and grievious grone, Cry Pardon me, thou just incensed God; I have done nothing for to purchase Grace, But spent my time about a womans face. For Beauty bloody through the world I ran, In pride of heart preferring Phælice Feature: For beauty I have ended many a man, Hating all other for one mortal creature: For Beauty I have pawn'd my utmost power; But for my sins not spent one weeping hour. My Nunquam sera I will now begin, And vow to spend the remnant of my days In contrite penance for my former sin, That God may pardon all the erring ways Which flesh and body were deceived by; Unto the world I will go learn to dye. Let me be censur'd even as mortals please, I'le please my God in all things may be done: Ambitious pride hath been my youths disease; I'le teach Age meekness e're my Glass be run: And change my voice, wealth, beauty, world, farewel, To purchase Heaven I will go pass through Hell. Phælice perceives his melancholly state, And coming to him, doth most mildly woo; My Lord (quoth she) why are you chang'd of late? As I share joy, let me bear sorrow too: If I in ought have mov'd you to offence, I will with tears perform due recompence. No, my dear Love (quoth Guy) no cause in thee, 'Tis with my self I discontented strive: By light of Grace my Nature's faults I see, That am as dead, although I seem alive: Phælice, my sins, my countless sins appear, Crying Repent, thy guilty conscience clear. I must deal with thee as Bavarus dealt (A Prince of Rome) with Sygunda his wife, Who (from a deep impression he felt) Vow'd Chastity perpetual all his life. Intreating thee (even as thou lov'st my soul) To pardon me, not urging by controul. Hast thou not heard what Ethelfrida did, A Christian woman sometimes Englands Queen; Is Edelthrudis act of chast life hid, A Princess likewise, and matchless doth seem; The first with child, no more of lust would tast, The second caus'd two husbands both live chast. And canst not thou (the Phœnix of a Realm) By imitation win immortal praise; Leaving thy Vertues and admired Theam, To the succeeding Age of Iron-days? I know thou canst, thy greater part's Divine, Where most is carnal, 'twill to flesh incline. Thou didst procure (although I do excuse it) My pride by Conquests to attain thy love: God gave me valour, I did vain abuse it; My heart and thoughts aspired far above The Crowns and Scepters of most potent Kings, I held their Diadems inferior things. But now I gather in a total sum, Such follies, and condemn them all to die: A man of other fashion I'le become; Some better travels for my soul to try, Not as before, in armour on my Steed, But in a Gown of gray, a Palmers weed. Obscure my journey, for I'le take no leave, But only leave my endless love to thee: Here is my ring, this memory receive, And swear the same, to make thee think on me, Let me have thine which for thy sake I'le keep, Till death close up these eyes with his dead sleep, When this was spoke, how she did wring her hands With sighs and tears, may be well deemed much; Yet wondrous meekly, nothing countermands; For the devotion of that age was such, To hold them blessed, could themselvs retire To solitude, and leave the worlds desire. Now is his Princely Clothing laid away, Wherein he glitter'd like the glorious sun; And his best habit, homely Countery-gray, Such as the poor plain people term home-spun, A Staff, a Scrip, a Scollop-shell in's hat, Not to be known, nor once admired at. And thus with pensive heart, and doleful tears, He leaves the fairest Creature England had; Who in her Face a Map of sorrow wears, A countenance compos'd all mournful, sad; Like unto one had banish'd all delight, Wishing for slumbers of eternal night. Guy journeys, towards the sanctified Ground, Whereas sometimes the Jews fair City stood: In which our Saviour's Sacred Head was crown'd, And where for sinful men he shed his blood: To see the Sepulcher was his intent, The Tomb that Joseph unto Jesus lent. With tedious miles he tir'd his weary feet, And passed desart places full of danger; At last with a most wosul Wight did meet, A man that unto sorrow was no stranger, For he had fifteen Sons made captive all To slavish bondage in extreemest Thrall. Who in a castle, which he held and chain'd them, Guy question'd where; and understands at length. The place not far; lend me thy sword (quoth he) I'le lend my man-hood all thy Sons to free. With that he goes, and lays upon the door, Like him that says, I must and will come in: The Giant never was so rouz'd before, For no such knocking at his gate had been; So takes his Club and Keys, and cometh out, Staring with ireful Countenance about. Sirrah (quoth he) what business hast thou here? Art come to feast the Crows about these Walls? Didst never hear, no ransom could him clear, That in the compass of my fury falls? For making me to take a Porters pains, With this same Club I will dash out thy brains. Sirrah (quoth Guy) y' are quarrelsome I see, Choler and you seem very near of kin: Dangerous at the Club be-like you be, I have been better arm'd, though now go thin. But shew thy utmost hate, enlarge thy sprite, Here is a weapon that must do me right. So draws his sword, salutes him with the same About the head, the shoulders, and the side, While his erected Club did death proclaim, Standing with huge Colossus spacious stride: Putting forth vigour to his knotty beam, That like a furnace he did smoak extream: But on the ground he spent his strokes in vain, For Guy was nimble to avoid them still: And ever e're he heav'd his Club again, Did brush his plated Coat against his will: At such advantage he would never fail To bang him soundly in his shirt of Mail. At length through thirst Amarant feeble grew, And said to Guy, As th' art of humane race, Shew it in this, Give Nature's wants their due; Let me but go and drink in yonder place: Thou canst not yield unto a smaller thing, Than to grant life that's given by the spring. I grant thee leave (Quoth Guy) go drink thy last To pledge the Dragon, and the Savage Boar: Succeed the Tragedies which they have past, But never think to drink cold water more, A woodcut illustration appears here in the text with the following caption: A Giant called Amarant, Guy valiantly destroyes; VVhereby wrong'd Ladies, captive Knights, Their liberty enjoys. Drink deep to death, and after that Carouse, Bid him receive thee in his earthen house. So to the spring he goes, and slakes his thirst, Taking the water in extreamly, like A wrecked Ship, that on some Rock is burst, When forced bulk against the Stones doth strike; Scooping it in so fast with both his hands That Guy admiring to behold it stands. Come on (quoth he) let us to work again, Thou art about thy Liquor over long, The fish that in the River do remain, Will want thereby, thy drinking doth them wrong; But I would see their satisfaction made, With Giants blood they must and shall be paid. Villian (quoth Amarant) I'le crush thee straight, Thy Life shall pay thy daring tongues offence; This Club (which is about an hundred weight) Is Deaths Commission to dispatch thee hence, Dress thee for Ravens diet I must needs, And break thy bones as they were made of reeds. Incensed much by these bold Pagans boasts, Which worthy Guy could ill indure to hear: He hews upon those big supporting posts, That like two pillars did the body bear; Amarant (for them wounds) in choler grows, And desperately at Guy his Club he throws. Which did directly on his body light; So violent, and weighty therewithall, That down to ground on sudden came the Knight, And e're he could recover from the fall, The Giant got a Club, again in's fist, And struck a stroke that wonderfully mist. Traytor (quoth Guy) thy falsehood I'le repay, This Coward-act, to intercept my blood; Says Amarant, I'le murther any way, With enemies all vantages are good; Oh! Could I poyson in thy nostrils blow, Thou should'dst be sure I would dispatch thee so. 'Tis well (said Guy) thy honest thoughts appear, Within that beastly bulk do Devils dwell, Which are thy Tenants while thou livest here, But will be Land-lords when thou com'st in Hell: Vile miscreant, prepare thee for their Den; Inhuman Monster, hateful unto men. But breathe thy self a time, while I go drink, For flaming Phœbus with his fiery eye Torments me so with burning heat, I think My thirst would serve to drink an Ocean dry: Forbear a little, as I dealt with thee. Quoth Amarant, thou hast no fool of me; No silly Wretch, my Father taught more wit, How I should use such enemies as thou: By all my gods I do rejoyce at it, To undestand that thirst constrains thee now: For all the treasure that the world contains, One drop of water shall not cool thy veins. Relieve my Foe! it were a mad mans part, Refresh an adversary to my wrong! If thou imagîne this, a child thou art: No fellow, I have known the world too long To be so simple; now I know thy want, A minutes space of breathing I'le not grant. And with these words heaving aloft his Club, Into the air he swings the same about; Then shakes his locks, and doth his temples rub, And like the Cyclops in his pride did strut. Sirrah (said he) I have you at a lift, You now are come unto your latest shift. Perish for ever, with this stroke I send thee, (A medicine will do thy thirst much good) Take thou no care for drink before I end thee, And then we'l have carouses of thy blood; Here's at thee with a Butcher's down-right blow, To please my fury with thine ovethrow. Infernal, false, obdurate Fiend (Guy said) That seem'st an Imp of cruelty from Hell; Ingrateful Monster, since thou hast deny'd, The things to me wherein I us'd thee well: With more revenge than e're my sword did make. On thy accursed head revenge I'le take. Thy Giants longitude shall shorter shrink, Except thy Sun scorcht skin be weapon-proof; Farewel my thirst, I do disdain to drink; Streams keep your water to your own behoof: Or let wild beasts be welcome thereunto, With those pearl-drops I will not have to do. Hold Tyrant, take a taste of my good will, For thus I do begin my bloody bout; You cannot chuse but like the greeting ill, It is not that same Club will bear you out; And take this payment on thy shagged crown; A blow that brought him with a veng'ance down. Then Guy set foot upon the Monsters brest, And from his shoulders did his head divide; Which with a yawning mouth did gape, unblest, No Dragons jaws were ever seen more wide To open and to shut, till life was spent; So Guy took's keys, and to the Castle went. Where many woful captives he did find, That had been tryed with extremities, Whom he in friendly manner did unbind, And reason with them of their miseries: Each told a tale with tears and sighs, and cryes, All weeping to him with complaining eyes: There tender Ladies in dark Dungeon lay, That were surprised in the desert Wood; And had no other diet every day, Than flesh of humane creatures for their food: Some with their Lovers bodies had been fed, And in their Wombs, their Husbands buried. Now he bethinks him of his coming there, T'enlarge the wronged brethren from their woes; And as he searched, both great clamours hear, By which sad sounds directon, on he goes, Untill he finds a darksome obscure Gate, Arm'd strongly over all with iron-plate: That he unlocks, and enters, where appears The strangest object that he ever saw, Men, that with famishment of many years, Were like deaths picture which the Painters draw. Divers of them were hanged by each thumb, Others head downward, by the middle some. With diligence he takes them from the walls, With Liberty their Thraldom to acquaint: Then the perplexed Knight, their Father calls, And says, Receive thy sons, though poor and faint, I promis'd you their lives, accept of that, But did not warrant you they should be fat. The Castle I do give thee, here's the keys, Where Tyranny for many years did dwell: Procure the gentle tender Ladies ease. For pity sake use wronged women well. Men eas'ly may revenge the deeds men do, But poor weak women have no strength thereto. The good old man, even overjoy'd with this, Fell on the ground, and would have kist Guy's feet, Father (quoth he) refrain so base a kiss, Fot age to honour youth I hold unmeet: Ambitious pride hath hurt me all it can, I go to mortifie a sinful man. CANTO XI. Guy on his journey doth proceed, with painful Pilgrims life, VVhile Warwicks Countess lives in tears a chast and loyal VVife. Behold the man that sought contentions out, Whose recreation was in angry arms, And for his Venns rang'd the world about, To find out dreadful combats, fierce alarms: From former disposition alienate, Shuns all occasion may procure debate. In his own wrongs by vow he will not strike, Let injury impose what strife can do, Abuses shall not force him to dislike, For he hath now fram'd Nature therunto: And taken patience by the hand for's guide, To lead his thoughts where meekness doth abide. No worldly joy can give his mind content; Delights are gone, as they had never been: His only care is, how he may repent His spending youth about the serving sin; And fashion Age to look like contrite sorrow, That little time to come, which life doth borrow, His looks were sad, complexion pale and wan, His diet of the meanest, hard and spare: His life he led like a Religious man, His habit poor and homely, thin and bare; His dignities and honour were forgot, His Warwicks Earldom he regarded not. Sometimes he would go search into a grave, And there he finds a rotten dead mans skull; And with the same a conference would have, Examining each vanity at full, And then himself would answer for the head, His own objection in the dead mans stead. If thou hast been some Monarch, where's thy crown, Or who in fear of thy stern looks do stand? Death hath made Conquest of my great renown, My golden Scepter, in a fleshly hand, Is taken from me by another King, And I in dust am made a rotten thing. Hast thou been some great Counsellor of State, Whose potent wit did rule a mighty Realm? Where is the policy thou hadst of late? Consum'd and gone, even like an idle dream. I have not so much wit as will suffice, To kill the worms that in my Coffin lies. Perhaps thou wast some beautious Ladies face, For whom right strange adventures have been wrought, Even such, as (when it was my loving case) For my dear kindest Phælce I have fought. Perhaps about this skull there was a skin Fairer than Hellen's was inclosed in. And on this scalp so wormy eaten bare, (Where nothing now but bone we may behold) Where Natures ornaments, such locks of hair, As might induce the eye to deem them gold; And chrystal Eyes in those two hollow caves; And here such lips, as love, for kissing craves. But where's the substance of this beauty sent, So loving, precious in the sight of men? With powerful death unto the dust it went; Grew loathsome, filthy, came to nothing then. And what a picture of it doth remain, To tell the wife, All beauty is but vain. Such memories he often would prefer, Of mortal frailty and the force of death: To teach the flesh how apt it is to err, And post repentance off till latest breath: Thus would he in the worlds contempt reprove All that seduce the soul from heavenly love. Now for a while reverse your vows of wo, For one sad subject to behold another, To see new sorrow back to England go, And to long absent years commit the other: Leave doleful Guy to aged grief and cares, And look on Phælice, how his Lady fares Like to a widow, all in black attire, She doth express her inward doleful mind: A Chamber-prison is her chief desire, Where she to passion wholly is enclin'd. She that of late was pride of English Court, With Majesty no longer will consort, But lives a life like one despis'd life's being; And every day unto the world did die, With judgment's eyes far into folly seeing, And nothing well, how fast false pleasures flie; Leaving for every taste of vain delight, A greater heap of cares than pen can write. Her thoughts run after her departed Lord, And travel'd in conceit more fast than he: What place (quoth she) can rest to thee afford, That pilgrim like hath thus forsaken me; Oh sad laments! my soul your burthen bears, To think poor Guy remembers me in tears. Methinks he sits now by a River side, And swells the water with his weeping eyes: Methinks that, Phælice, Phælice, loud he cry'd, And charged Eccho bear it through the skies; Then rising up he runs with might and main, Saying, sweet Eccho bring my love again. Then comes he to a Cypress Tree, and says, Sylvanus, this was once the lovely Boy, Whom thou for feature to the Clouds didst praise, But here's thy sensless and transformed joy; 'Tis nothing now but boughs and leaves, and tree, And made to wither, as all beauties be. And then methinks he sits him sadly down, And on his bending knees his elbow stays, With head in hand, saying, Farewel renown, Vanish vain pleasures of my youthful days; My true repentance do you all displace; A happy end brings sinful souls to grace. Ah worthy man that thus canst mortifie The Rebel flesh, to conquer Adams nature, And for the gaining of Eternity, Dost live on earth, as if an earthly creature; Dead and alive, old and new-born again, True Valiant Guy, that hath the Devil slain. As thy advice was when thou didst depart, That I should live a Vestal Virgins life; Although when I was Maid, by Lovers art Thou didst perswade me to become a Wife: I vow by Heaven's, and all the Pow'rs Divine, To keep my thoughts as constant, chaste as thine. My beauty I will blemish all I may, With tears, and sighs, and doleful lamentation; By abstinance I will attain the way To overcome the force of sins temptation: This sentence have I often read and seen, A womans chastity is Virtues Queen. Cerus and Bacebus I will careful shun, Foes to Diana, Friends to Venus ever; Unto licentious life they teach us run, And with sobriety associate never, Spare Diet shall become my daily fare, The soul thrives best to keep the body bare. The Courtly ornament I wore of late, In honour of King Athelstons's fair Queen, Ev'n all those Jewels and those Robes of State, Wherein so often I was glorious seen, Shall with their price and value now supply Those naked poor that in the streets do lie: The Gold and Silver that I do possess, About good works shall all imployed be; The purchase of eternal happiness Is of all wealth most precious unto me; All that in want to VVarwick Castle come, And crave relief, I will afford them some. For halt, and lame, and blind, I will provide Some Hospital, with Land to be maintain'd; For widows, and poor fatherless beside, That their necessities may be sustain'd; For young Beginners their Estates to raise; And for repairing of decay'd High-ways. This I account to be the Heavenly thrift, Lay up your Treasure where it cannot rust. And give the riches we receive by gift, As each good Steward is enjoyn'd he must: That after this short stinted life's decay, We may have life an everlasting day. Rejected World, thus do I take my leave With thee, and all things thou do'st most esteem: Thy shews are snares, and all thy hopes deceive, Thy goodness is but only good to seem: Of thy false pleasures, I as much have seen, As she that bears the Title of a Queen. Oh that I were in such unknown disguise, (Attending on my Guy where-ere he be) As once the King Sulpitia did devise, His Lentulus in banishment to see! Or Hypsicrata like, in mans attire Following her exil'd King, through Love's desire. 'Twould something ease my sorrow wounded heart, So to divide the burthen of unrest; For where affliction take afflictions part, In hard extreams some comfort is exprest Misery is more easie to abide, When friends with friends their crosses do divide. But all in vain I wish'd, would God I were; Or thus, or thus, it nought avails my woe: Though starving thoughts do wander here and there, My poor weak body knows not where to go: Unto the Holy-Land I heard him say God send me thither at my dying day. I will about my vows, and see them paid, To do the goood that Charity requires: When grace to works of virtue does perswade, 'Tis blessedness to further such desires. And while on earth I do a sinner dwell, I'le strive to please my God with living well. In this resolve, that life she entertains, Performing all the course she had propounded, And such severity therein explains, Her sex with wonder rests amaz'd, confounded, To see so rare a beauty, rich, high-born, Hold all worlds pleasures in contempt and scorn. For no perswading friend that she would hear, Which motion'd company or recreation; Unto their speech she would not lend an ear, That sought to alter her determination: But such as came, and of compassion spake, She did relieve for blessed Jesus sake. Her wandring Lord from Land to Land repairs, To seek out places Pilgrims do frequent: By careful years turn'd into silver hairs; Exceeding chang'd with grief and languishment. (For sorrow gives a man more ancient look Than elder time, which lesser cares have took). His old acquaintance in those foreign parts, That had before most worthy actions seen, Right bold adventures of his long deserts, Had lost Sir Guy, as he had never been. Those that in Armour knew his Martial face, Did not expect him in a Friars case. Amongst the rest to whom he had been known, He met Earl Terry banish'd to exile: Each unto other being strangers grown, Through sorrow, which the senses do beguile; They had forgot that ere they saw each other, Yet Guy was Terry's, Terry Guy's sworn brother. Having related how their Travels grew, One's voluntary, t'other's by constraint; In taking leave with courtesies adieu, Oh English man (saith Terry, sighing faint) I had a friend, a Countrey-man of thine, Was Justice Champion to great wrongs of mine. Tyranny to the free he durst defie. And stamp his foot upon oppression's neck: Tell me, dear friend, hast thou not heard of Guy, That had a hand to help, in sword to check? I have (quoth he) and knew him many years, Guy VVarwick's Earl, is one of England Peers. What is thy name, Terry (quoth he) I hight, Greater by birth than fortune makes me seem. Terry (said he) I vow to do thee right In what I may, my poor good will esteem: To human thought my nature doth agree, Thou lov'st my friend, I must of force love thee. Direct me to the man exil'd thee thus, I'le take thy part as far as strength extends: If Guy himself were here to joyn with us, He could but say, I'le venture life and friends. And be assured, though I simple be, I oft have had as good success as he. Terry with loving thanks his love requites, And brings him to his Foe, whom he defies, And valiant with his adverse Champion fights, Till mortal wounded at his feet he dies; Yet 'twas a man suppos'd of matchless worth, That for that Combat they had singled forth. When this was done, the Earl demands his name: Pardon (quoth he) that were against a vow; To no man living I'le reveal the same, For I have changed name and nature now: Nature's corruption I do strive to leave, A new regeneration to receive. Farewel my friend, ev'n as my soul would fare, If we ne're meet on earth, Heav'n be the place; For idle hours I have none to spare, My hairs look gray, they turn to white apace; I have great loss in short time to redeem; A minute's sorrow is of much esteem So he departs towards Judea's ground, Samaria and Galilee to see, Those parts where Christian Pilgrims so renown'd Because their Saviour's choice was there to be, Where he did suffer to redeem our loss; Ev'n from the Cratch unto the bloody Cross. Much time he spends and many years bestows, From place to place about this holy-Land, That all his friends in England do suppose, Now death of him hath got the upper-hand: For no report came that could ere relate His life, his being, or his present state. This put the world to silence, men were mute, Concerning Guy they knew not what to say. The dreadful Champion in the armed suit, Was never known nor fear'd in simple gray, But did endeavour all that ere he might, Never to be reveal'd to any Wight. For unto none he would his name disclose, Nor tell direct what Countrey-man he was; Nor of his noble mind make any shows, But strive in all things most obscure to pass, Until by native love his mind was led, To come and lay his bones where he was bred. CANTO XII. Guy after many years comes home, To England for his grave, Kills Colbrond the great Giant, and Dies poorly in a Cave. Ev'n as the brightest glorious shining-day Will have a night of darkness to succeed; Which takes the pride of Phœbus quite away, And makes the Earth to mourn in sable weed: Presenting us with drowsie heavy sleep, Death's memory in careful thoughts to keep: So youth the day of Nature's strength and beauty, Which had a splendor like fair Heaven's eye, Must yield to age by a submissive duty, And grow so dark, that life of force must dye, When length of years brings ancient evening on, Irrevocable time is posting gone. This cogitation in Guy's breast appears, By his returning from the Holy Land; He finds himself to be a man in years, And that his Glass had but a little sand To run, before his date of life expire, Therefore to England he doth back retire, There to be buried where he had been born, Was all the cause that did induce him back: To end his evening where he had his morn, In doleful colours of a dead man's black: And let that body rest in English ground, Which through the world no resting place had found. When he arrived on his native shore, He found his Countrey in extream distress; For through the Kingdom armed troops great store, Against the Foe was all in readiness, The King of Denmark, whose destroying hand, A mighty Army did securely land; And marched from the Coast with devastation, Destroying Towns, Villages set on fire; Working such terror unto all the Nation, King Athelstone was forced to retire To VVinchester. Which when the Danes once knew, Towards the City all their strength they drew, Which was too strong for Spear and Shield to win, (Invincible their walls of stone were then) They wanted Cannon keys to let them in. Hell's picklock powder was unknown to men: The Devil had not taught such murthering smoak; A Soldier's honour was in manly stroke: Beholding now how they repulsed were, That VVinchester by no means could be won: They do conclude to summon parly there, And with a Challenge have all quarrels done; An English man to combat with a Dane, And that King lose, that had his Champion slain. Wherewith a huge great Giant doth appear, Demanding where the Foxes all were crept; Saying, if one dare come and meet me here, That hath true valour for his Countrey kept, Let him come forth, his manhood to disclose, Or else the Eaglish are but cowards foes. Why, very Cravens on their Dunghils dare Both crow and strike, before they run and cry; Is English Courage now become so rare, That none will fight, because they fear to dye? That I pronounce you all faint-hearted fools, Afraid to look on manly martial tools? What slanders I have heard in foreign lands, Of those poor men for deeds which they have done! Most false they are belied of their hands; But he says true, that says their feet can run; They have a Proverb to instruct them in, That 'tis good sleeping in a sound whole skin. Thus did he vaunt in terms of proud disdain, And threw his Gauntlet down, say'ng, There's my glove: At length great Guy no longer could refrain, Seeing all strain court'sies to express their love: A woodcut illustration appears here in the text with the following caption: Guy fights to free all England's fear, With Colbrond Giant Dane: And in Hide-Mead at Winchester, Was that Goliah slain. But comes unto the King, and says, Dread Lord! This combate to thy unknown Knight afford. Although in simple habit I am hid, Yeilding no shew of that I undertake, I ne're attempted ought but what I did; An end of Colbrond, on my soul, I'le make. Palmer (quoth Athelstone) I like thy sprite, God send thee thither, and He aid thee right. His Powerful Hand lend vigour to thy blows, And grant thy foot upon thy Foe may tread; Amen, quoth Guy, and with great courage goes Forth VVinchester's North-gate unto Hide-Mead Where that same Monster of a man he found, Treading at every step two yards of ground. Art thou the man (quoth Colbrond) art thou he On whom the King will venture England's Crown? Can he not find a fitter match for me, Than this poor Rascal in a thred-bare Gown? Where's all his Knights and worthy Champions now? I do disdain so base a Slave as thou. Giant, said Guy, Manhood should never rail, To breathe the air with blast of idle wind; A Soldier's weapon best can tell his tale, Thy destiny upon my Sword I find; 'Twill let thee blood, while thou hast drops to bleed, And spell thy death for all the Danes to read. Thus I begin; and on his armour laid, That Colbrond's Coat was never cudgel'd so, Who with his Club did watch to meet his blade, Intending to have brok'n it with a blow; But Guy was sure his sword would hold out play, It had been trusted many a cruel fray And therefore boldly he presumes thereon, Laying about as fast as he could strive, Until the Lubbers breath was almost gone, (For with a weighty Club did Colbrond strive) Which lighting on the ground, made earth give way, As if some Devil did about him lay. So long they held this stern and ireful fight, That the beholders knew not what to deem, Yet still some wounds to Colbrond's share did light, Which to the English did great comfort seem. Besides, their Champion gave encouragement, By active carriage, danger to prevent. Quoth Colbrond, English man, wilt thou forbear, And sue for mercy, let the fight alone? Villain (quoth Guy) I scorn thy Coward fear, I'le have thy life, or it shall cost mine own: We'l never part till one be soundly sped, The King hath ventur'd England on my head. For twenty Denmarks (if they might be found) And all the wealth that on the Ocean swims, I will not yield an inch of English ground; Thou shalt find metal in these aged limbs: Although thy bodie's height be more than mine, I have a heart bigger by odds than thine. Think on thy ancient Grandsire, Gogmagog, Whom Corineus dealt withall at Dover; How that same Lubber, like a Timber log, Was by the worthy Britain tumbled over; For his bold challenge, he had such a check, There was no Surgeon could amend his neck. Thou art deceiv'd in me, poor silly Sot, I am untaught to bend submission's knees: Hold me no Christian, if I fail a jot, (And for the world that title I'le not leese) Betake thee to thy Tools, honour thy king, Upon thy manhood lies a mighty thing. And thus I do encounter thee afresh: With that he lent him such a powerful stroke It made wide ruptures in the Giant's flesh, And did his furious choler much provoke; Laying about him in most cruel rage, Till the next wound did all his heat asswage, It was so mortal that it brought him down, To lie and groan upon the bloody ground: Forthwith a shout was heard from out the Town, That all the skie did eccho to the sound; Great joy was made by ev'ry English heart, And all the Danes with extream grief depart. King Athelstone sent for his Champion then, To do him honour for his famous deed: Who was received by the Clergy-men With all solemnity, for such high meed: Embraced by the Nobles, and renown'd, With Martial Musick, Drum, and Trumpets sound. But little pleasure Guy conceives herein, Refusing Jewels, costly ornaments, Saying, with these he out of love had been For many years by true experiments: Only thanks God, that blest him with an hour, To free his Countrey from invading pow'r. And so intreats that he may pass unknown, To live where poverty regards not wealth, And be beholding to the help of none, Seeing the world but now and then by stealth. For true content doth such a Treasure bring, It makes the begger richer than a King. With true content (said he) I will abide, In homely Cottage, free from all resort; But I have found, content cannot be spy'd, To make abode within a Monarchs Court: No there's ambition, pride, and envy seen, And fawning flatt'ring stepping still between. Yet gentle Palmer (said the King) agree, Where-ever thou resolvest to remain: Acquaint thy name in private unto me, And this is all thy Soveraign will obtain: Tell me but who thou art, I will conceal it, As I am England's King, I'le not reveal it. Why then (quoth he) your Grace shall understand I am your Subject, Guy of VVarwick named; That have these many years not seen your Land, But been where youth by ancient age is tamed: Yet there experience taught me wit, dread Prince, The world of many follies to convince. And now am come to bring my bones to grave, Within the Kingdom where I first took life; Yet shall no creature else the notice have Of my arrival, not my dearest Wife, Till sickness come, and doth my death foretell. Then I'le acquaint her with my last farewell. The King with joy imbrac'd him in his arms, And with great admiration answers thus; Most worthy Earl, freer of England's harms, It grieves my soul thou wilt not live with us: Oh were thy resolutions thoughts, but now, That my perswasions might prevent thy vow, But, 'tis too late, they are grown ripe, I see Thou art too setled in determination; Well, Honoured man, yet this joys me, Thou bring'st thy bones unto thy dearest Nation; Where Monuments of thy great deeds shall last, Till after-ages of the world be past. In VVarwick Castle shall thy Sword be kept, To witness to the world what thou hast been, And least forgetful time should intercept, A President, I present will begin; The Castle-keeper shall receive a Fee, To keep thy sword in memory of thee. Thy Armour likewise, and thy Martial Spear, That did thee service in thy high designs, Shall be preserved very careful there, That all such men as have distrustful minds, May think (if from a truth it did not grow) A King would scorn to cozen people so. And in thy Chappel (distant thence a mile) A bone shall hang of that same cruel beast, Which near to Coventry remain'd long while, Whose rib by measure is six foot at least; Destroying many that did pass that way, Until thy manhood did the Savage slay. That by tradition, men may speak and tell, This was Guys Armour, this his Massie blade; These bones of murthering beasts which men did quel, And this the Tomb wherein his Corps where laid. This the true Picture of his shape at length. And this the Spear did oft express his strength. For sure I hold it an ungrateful thing, (When thou by Natures course in dust shall lie) No memory shall cause some Muse to sing The worthiness of matchless English Guy: Thy Country-men would prove too far unkind, When out of sight, they leave thee out of mind. This said, in humble duty (wondrous meek) Guy reverenceth the King, and so departs, Some solitary Den, or Cave to seek, Which he unto his Mansion-house converts: And so lives poorly in the hollow ground, Making his meat of herbs and roots he found. Sometimes he would to VVarwick Castle go, And crave an alms at his dear Ladies hand, Who unto Pilgrims did more bounty show, Than any Noble woman in the Land; And she would ask all Palmers that came there, If at the Holy Land they never were? Or in their travels, if they had not seen An English man was Lord of that same Tower? Who many years away from hence had been, A Knight ne're conquer'd yet by human Power. But there's a Tyrant whom I only fear, They call him Death, that murthers every where; If he have met him (O my dearest Lord) I never shall behold thy face again, Till that same Monster do as much afford Unto my heart, and so release all pain. Which gracious Heaven grant, if Guy be dead, Upon the earth let me no longer tread. Thus did he often hear his Wife enquire, With deep complaints from extream passions flowing; Yet by no means would grant her kind desire The comfort of a hopeful word bestowing; But look upon her as his heart would break, Then turn away for fear his tongue should speak; And so departs with weeping to his Cell, Setting a dead man's head before his eyes: Saying, with thee I shortly come to dwell, This sinful flesh I constantly despise, My soul is weary of so bad a guest, And doth desire to be at home in rest. My feeble limbs weakness doth sore possess, And sickness gripes do touch about my heart; I feel I am not far from happiness, But am in hope my foe and I shall part; This adversary which I long have fed, By whom my soul hath been so much misled. To my dear Phælice I will send my Rring, Which I did promise for her sake to keep: I may no longer time defer the thing, For fear that death prevent me with his sleep; I feel his messenger approach apace, And poor weak nature must of force give place: So call'd a Herds-man as he passed by, And said, Good friend, do me a special favour, Even in a matter that concerns me high. (My hope relies upon thy kind behaviour) To VVarwick Castle speedily repair, And for the Countess ask, with trusty care Deliver thou this Ring to her own hand, And say, the ancient Pilgrim sent the same That lately at her Gate with Scrip did stand, To beg an alms in blessed Jesus Name. And if she ask thee where I do remain, Direct her hither, she'l requite thy pain. Sir (quoth the Herds-man) I shall be asham'd, That ne're durst speak to Lady in my life: Nay more, and't please you, I may much be blam'd, To carry Rings to such a great man's Wife. Besides, if I should lose it by the way, Why what would you and Madam Phælice say? Prethee (said Guy) frame not such idle doubt, No prejudice can light on thee at all; The act is honest which thou go'st about, And for it none can thee in question call: A courteous ear the Lady will thee lend, Upon my warrant, fear you nothing friend. With that he goes, and mannerly betakes The token, to the Countess; which she seeing, Most admirable wonder at it makes, Ah friend (quoth she) where is my Husband's being? Husband (said he) that news I do not bring, From an old Begger I receiv'd the Ring. His house was made of neither wood nor stone, But under ground into a hole he went: And in my conscience there he dwells alone, And never pays his Landlord quarters rent. Ah 'tis my Guy, she said, shew me his Cell, And for thy pains I will reward thee well. So he directs VVarwick's fair Countess thither, Who entring in that melancholy place, Her Lord and she imbracing, weep together, Unable to pronounce a word long space, Long time them two had not a word to speak, Till Guy's discretion Sorrows door did break: Phælice, quoth he, now take thy leave of Guy, That sent to see thee e're his sight decay: Within thy arms I do intreat to die, And breathe my spirit from thy sweat soul away. Thou gav'st me alms at VVarwick Castle late: 'Tis blessedness to pity poor mens state. Look not so strange, bewail not so my Dear; Ah! weep not Love, I do not want thy tears: I have shed plenty since my coming here; Of true Remorse, my conscience witness bears, Thou weep'st not now, because I wept no more, But to behold me friendless, hapless, poor. Wife, I have sought the place that I desire, Though few endeavour for eternal rest; The soul which to that Heaven doth aspire, Must leave the world, and worldly things detest; 'Tis full of Devils that on Souls do wait, And full of mates; in every place some bait. Ah Phælice, I have spent (and then he wept) Youth (natures day) upon the love of thee; And for my God, old rotten age have kept, The night [illeg.] Christ forgive it me; Sorrow lies heavy on my soul for this, Sweet Saviour Christ, pardon thou my amiss. In that I had destroy'd so many men, Even for one Woman to enjoy thy love; Therefore in this solitary Den, I sought my peace with that great God above, 'Gainst whom by sin I have been more mis-led Than there be hairs upon my hoary-head. A woodcut illustration appears here in the text with the following caption: Guy in repentance poorly lives, Obscurely in a Cave; Reveal'd to Phælice by a Ring, When death had digg'd his Grave. The other day, seeing my Body ill, And all the parts thereof opprest with pain, I did compose a Testament and Will, To be the last that ever I ordain. Lo here it is, I'le read it if I can, Before I cease to be a living man. HIS WILL. Even in the name of him whose mighty Power Created all in Heaven and Earth contained, As one to dye this very instant hour, I leave the world, and all therein, unfeigned: My Soul I give to him that gave it me; Receive it Jesus, as I trust in thee. I owe a debt of Life is due to Death, And when it's paid him, he can ask no more; A very vapour of a little breath; Would he had had it many years before; But here's my comfort, if he come or stay, 'Tis ready for him (if he will) to day. I owe the world a stock of wealth is lent, When I did enter traffique with the same: Less would have given Nature more content, 'Tis happiness to want a rich mans name. World, leave me naked, as I did begin; I ask but one poor sheet to wrap me in. I do bequeath more sins than I can number, My deadly evils in a countless sum; Even from my cradle unto death's dead slumber, These past, these present, all that are to come, To him that made them loads to burthen me, Satan, Receive them, for they came from thee. I give good thoughts, and every vertuous deed, That every grace hath guided me unto, To him from whom all goodness doth proceed, For only evil, Nature taught me do: Twas conceived, bred and born in sin, And all my life most vile and vain hath been. I give to sorrow all my sighs end cryes, Fetcht from the bottom of a bleeeding heart, I give repentance, tears, and watry eyes, The sign unfeigned of a true Convert. Earth yield a grave, or Sea become a tomb, Jesus unto my Soul grant Heaven room. Phælice, I faint, farewel true loyal wife, Assist me with thy Prayers, thy Husband dies, I trust to meet thee in a better life, Where tears shall wiped be from weeping eyes. Come blessed spirit, come in Jesus Name, Receive my Soul, to him convey the same. And with these words his quiet Spirit departs, While mournful Phælice well-nigh dead with woe, Her Senses all to sorrows use converts, And too abundant doth her tears bestow, Beating her breast, till breast and heart be sore, Wringing her hands till she could strive no more Then sighing, said, Ah Death! my sorrows cause, Thou hast depriv'd me of my dearest Lord! Since loathsom air my vital spirits draws, This favour for thy Tyranny afford, Do me a good to recompence thy ill, And strike the stroke that all my cares can kill. Let me not live to see to morrows light, But make me cold, bloodless, pale and wan, As this dead Carkass doth appear in sight, This true description of a mortal man: Whose deeds of wonder past and gone before, Hath left him now at Deaths dark prison-door. Kissing his face, with a farewel of tears. She leaves the body for the grave to claim; And from that place as sad a Soul she bears, As ever woman that the world can name; Living but fifteen days after his death, And then through extream sorrow yieldeth breath.
