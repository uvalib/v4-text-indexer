      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE and my very good Lady the Lady Rich.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPISTLE To the Illustrous and noble Lord Don Iuan de Castella de Villa Noua, Baron of Bicorb and Quesa, of George of Montemayor. To the same Lord. Mœcenas was to Maro of great fame A singular good Lord and louing frend, And Alexander did enioy that same Rare wit of Homer, death though him did end: And so the Uillanouas generous name The Lusitan poore Authour doth defend, Making a base and wanting wit t'aspire Vnto the clouds, and yet a great deale higher. Don Gaspar Romani to the Authour. If Lady Lavras memorie vnstained Petrarc in endlesse verse hath left renowned: And if with Laurell Homer hath beene crowned For writing of the wars the Greekes obtained: If Kings t'aduaunce the glorie they haue gained In life time, when fierce Mars in battell frowned, Procure it should not be in Lethe drowned, But after death by historie maintained: More iustly then shouldst thou be celebrated (O excellent Diana) for the fairest Of all the faire ones, that the world hath brought foorth: Since all those wits, whose pens were estimated To write the best, in glorie thou impairest, And from them all the Laurell crowne hast sought foorth. Don Hieronymo Sant-Perez, to George of Montemayor. Parnasse, O sacred mount and full of glorie, The Poets muse, delight of their desires: Me thinkes thou art too comfortlesse and sorie, Compar'd with this, whose famous name aspires. In deede J am, since that the Muses left me, And with their gracious Quire from hence descended To mount this Hill, whose Greatnes hath bereft me Of all my fame, and glorie that is ended. Thrise happie his Diana, since her flower In top of this High Hill was set so lately, That all the world might view it euery hower, Where she doth liue most soueraigne and stately: In all the world most celebrate and graced, Being no lesse excelse, then highly placed. The first Booke of Diana of George of Montemayor. [Haire in change what libertie] Haire in change what libertie, Since I sawe you, haue I seene? How vnseemely hath this greene Bene a signe of hope to me? Once I thought no Shepherd might In these fieldes be found (O haire) (Though I did it with some feare) Worthy to come neere your sight. Haire, how many times and tydes Did my faire Diana spie, If I ware or left you by And a thousand toyes besides. And how oft in weeping sort (Of deceitfull teares O springs) Was she iealous of the things, Which I spake or did in sport? Those faire eies which wrought my woe, (Golden haire) tell me what fault In beleeuing them I caught, When they did assure me soe? Saw you not how she did greeue, Spilling daily many a teare, Vnto her till I did sweare, That I did her words beleeue? Who more beautie euer knew In a subiect of such change, Or more sorrowes or more strange In a loue so perfect true? On the sand her did I see Sitting by yon riuer bright, Where her finger this did wright Rather dead then changed be. See how loue beares vs in hand, Making vs beleeue the wordes, That a womans wit affordes, And recorded in the sand. [I am a louer, but was neuer loued] I am a louer, but was neuer loued, Well haue I lou'd, and will though hated euer, Troubles I passe, but neuer any mooued, Sighes haue I giuen, and yet she heard me neuer: I would complaine, and she would neuer heare me, And flie from loue, but it is euer neere me: Obliuion onely blamelesse doth beset me, For that remembreth neuer to forget me. For euery ill one semblant I doe beare still, To day not sad, nor yesterday contented, To looke behinde, or go before I feare still, All things to passe alike I haue consented: I am besides my selfe like him that daunceth, And mooues his feete at euery sound that chaunceth: And so all like a senselesse foole disdaines me, But this is nothing to the greefe that paines me. The night to certaine louers is a trouble, When in the day some good they are attending: And other some doe hope to gaine some double Pleasure by night, and wish the day were ending: With that, that greeueth some, some others ease them, And all do follow that, that best doth please them: But for the day with teares I am a crying, Which being come, for night I am a dying. Of Cupid to complaine who euer craue it, In waues he writes and to the windes he crieth: Or seeketh helpe of him, that neuer gaue it: For he at last thy paines and thee defieth. Come but to him some good aduise to lend thee, To thousand od conceits he will commend thee. What thing is then this loue? It is a science, That sets both proofe and study at defiance. My Mistresse loued her Syrenus deerely, And scorned me, whose loues yet I auouched, Left to my greefe, for good I held it cleerely, Though narrowly my life and soule it touched: Had I but had a heauen as he once shining, Loue would I blame, if it had bene declining. But loue did take no good from me he sent me, For how can loue take that he neuer lent me. Loue's not a thing, that any may procure it, Loue's not a thing, that may be bought for treasure; Loue's not a thing, that comes when any lure it, Loue's not a thing, that may be found at pleasure: For if it be not borne with thee, refraine it To thinke, thou must be borne anew to gaine it: Then since that loue shuns force, and doth disclame it, The scorned louer hath no cause to blame it. [For a fauour of such woorth] For a fauour of such woorth In no debt I doe remaine, Since with selfe same coyne againe (Mistresse) thou art paide right foorth. For if I enioy with free Pleasure, seeing before me Face and eies, where Cupid stands: So thou seeing in my hands, That which in thine eies I see. Let not this to thee seeme ill, That of thy beautie diuine Thou see'st but the figure shine, And I natures perfect skill: Yet a thought, that's free and set Neuer yet in Cupids net, Better then the bond beholdes, Though the one the liuely mouldes, Th' other but the counterfet. [O eies, that see not him, who look'd on yow] O eies, that see not him, who look'd on yow When that they were the mirrours of his sight, What can you now behold to your content? Greene flowrie meade where often I did vew, And staid for my sweete friend with great delight, The ill, which I doe feele with me lament. Heer did he tell me how his thoughts were bent, And (wretch) I lent an eare; But angry more then whelplesse Beare Presumptuous him I call'd, and vndiscreete: And he layde at my feete, Where yet (poore man) me thinkes I see him lye: And now I wish that I Might see him so as then I did: O happy time were this, Sweete shadowed riuer bankes tell me where my Syrenus is. Yon is the riuer banke this is the meade, From thence the hedge appeeres and shadowed lay, Wherein my flockes did feede the sauourie grasse: Behold the sweete noys'd spring, where I did leade My sheepe to drinke in heate of all the day, When heere my sweetest friend the time did passe: Vnder that hedge of liuely greene he was; And there behold the place, Where first I saw his sweetest face And where he sawe me, happy was that day, Had not my ill haps way To end such happy times, O spring, O hedge, and euery thing Is heere, but he, for whom I paine continually, and misse, Sweete shadowed riuer bankes tell me where my Syrenus is. Heere haue I yet his picture that deceaues me, Since that I see my Shepherd when I view it, (Though it were better from my soule absented) When I desire to see the man, that leaues me (Which fond deceipt time showes and makes me rue it) To yonder spring I goe, where I consented To hang it on yon Sallow, then contented I sit by it, and after (Fond loue) I looke into the water, And see vs both then am I so content heere, As when his life he spent heere: This bare deuise a while my life sustaineth; But when no more it faineth, My hart surcharg'd with anguish, and cries out, but yet amisse, Sweete shadowed riuer bankes tell me where my Syrenus is. Speaking to it no wordes it is replying, And then (me thinkes) reuenge of me it taketh, Bicause sometime an answere I despised. But (wofull soule) I say vnto it crying, Syrenus speake, since now thy presence maketh Aboade, where neuer once my thoughts surmized: Say, in my soule art thou not onely prized? But not a word it saieth, And as before me there it staieth, To speake, my soule doth pray it (in conclusion) O what a braue delusion, To aske a simple picture toong or sences? O time, in what offences Of vainest hope is my poore soule so subiect vnto his? Sweete shadowed riuer bankes tell me where my Syrenus is. I neuer can go homeward with my sheepe, When to the west the sunne begins to gyre, Nor to the foldes returne from our towne, But euery where I see, and (seeing) weepe The sheepe cote of my ioy and sweete desire Broken, decaied, and throwen vnto the ground: Carelesse of lambes and sheepe, there sit I downe A little while, vntill The herdesmen feeding on the hill, Cry out to me, saying, O Shepherdesse What doe thy thoughts possesse, And let thy sheepe goe feeding in the graine? Our eies doe see it plaine: For them the tender grasse in pleasant vales doth growe ywisse, Sweete shadowed riuer bankes tell me where my Syrenus is. Yet in thine owne opinion greater reason (Syrenus) it had bene, thus to haue started With more constraint, and force then I did see yet, But whom doe I accuse of guiltlesse treason? For what could make him stay and not haue parted, If fate and fortune thereto did agree yet? No fault of thine it was, nor could it be yet In my beleefe, haue ended Thou wouldst in ought, or haue offended Our loue so plaine and simple, as to leaue it Nor will I once conceaue it, Though many shewes and signes thereof there were yet: O no, the fates did sweare it, With cloudes of sorrow to obscure my heauen of ioy and blisse, Sweete shadowed riuer bankes tell me where my Syrenus is. My song take heede thou goest where I betake thee, Yet shalt thou not forsake me: For it may be that fortune will with such a humour place thee, That may terme thee importunate and by that meanes disgrace thee. [Syrenus, what thought'st thou when I was viewing thee] Syluanus. Syrenus, what thought'st thou when I was viewing thee From yonder hedge, and in great greefe suspending me To see with what affliction thou wert ruing thee? There doe I leaue my flocke, that is attending me: For while the cleerest sunne goeth not declining it, Well may I be with thee, by recommending me Thine ill (my Shepherd) for that (by defining it) Is passed with lesse cost, then by concealing it: And sorrow (in the end) departs resigning it. My greefe I would recount thee, but reuealing it, It doth increase, and more, by thus recording me How in most vaine laments I am appealing it: My life I see (O greefe) long time's affoording me With dying hart, and haue not to reuiue me it, And an vnwonted ill I see aboording me, From whom I hop'd a meane, she doth depriue me it: But (sooth) I hop'd it neuer, for bewraying it, With reason she might gainsay to contriue me it. My passions did sollicite her, essaying yet With no importune meanes, but seemely grounding them, And cruell loue went hindering and dismaying it. My pensiue thoughts were carefully rebounding them On euery side, to flie the worst, restraining them, And in vnlawfull motions not confounding them. They prai'd Diane, in ils that were not fayning them, To giue a meane (but neuer to repell it thee) And that a wretch might so be entertaining them. But if to giue it me, I should refell it thee, What wouldst thou doe (O greefe) that thus adiuring it, Faine would I hide mine ill, and neuer tell it thee. But after (my Syrenus) thus procuring it, A Shepherdesse I doe inuoke (the fairest one) And th' end goes thus, vnto my cost enduring it. Syrenus. Syluanus mine, a loue, of all the rarest one, A beautie, blinding presently disclosing it, A wit, and in discretion the waryest one. A sweete discourse, that to the eare opposing it, The hardest rocks entendereth in subduing them. What shall a haplesse louer feele in loosing it? My little sheepe I see, and thinke in viewing them, How often times I haue beheld her feeding them, And with her owne to foulde them, not eschewing them. How often haue I met her driue, and speeding them Vnto the riuer, in the heate, where resting her With great care she was telling yet, and heeding them. After, if that she was alone, deuesting her, Thou shouldst haue seene the bright sunne beames enuying her Resplendant hayre, to kembe them manifesting her. But on the sudden meeting, and espying her, (My deerest friend Syluane) how oft incended was Her fairest face, with orient blushing dying her? And with what grace, how mildly reprehended was My staying long, which she did aske, correcting me? Which if I greeu'd, with blandishments amended was. How many daies haue I found her expecting me At this cleere fountaine, when that I was seeking her Along that thickest hedge, to greefe subiecting me? All paines and troubles what so ere (in meeting her) Of sheepe, or lambes, we straightway were forgetting them, When she sawe me, or when that I was greeting her. Some other times (Syluane) we tun'd (in setting them) Our Bagpipe and the Rebeck, which we plaied on, And then my verses sung we, nothing letting them. After with bowe and arrowes we estraied on, Sometimes with nets, and she neuer refraining me, And came not home without some chase we prated on. Thus fortune went by these meanes entertaining me: Reseruing for some greater ill, and tendring me, Which hath no end, but by deathes end restraining me. Syluanus. Syrenus, that most cruell loue, engendring me Such greefe, stints not, nor hindreth the perswading me Of so much ill: I die therein remembring me. Diane I sawe, but straight my ioy was fading me, When to my onely sight she was opposing her: And (to my greefe) I saw long life inuading me. How many tymes haue I found her, in losing her, How often lost, in finding and espying her? And I my death and seruice not disclosing her. My life I lost, when meeting I was eying her Faire louely eies, which, full of anger, cruelly She turn'd to me, when that my speech was plying her: But her faire haire, where Cupides in their fuell lye, When she vndid and leemb'd, vnseene, then leauing me, My ils return'd most sensibly, which rue well I. But pitilesse Diana then perceiuing me, Turn'd like a cruell serpent, that in winding it, Assailes the lion: thus my life bereauing me. One time false hope (deceitfully but blinding it) My hart maintain'd, euen for my comfort choosing it, But afterwardes in such an error finding it, It mocked hope, and then it vanisht loosing it. A Sonnet. Mine eies, once haue I seene you more contented, And my poore hart, more ioyfull I haue knowne thee: Woe to the cause, whose greefes haue ouer growne thee, And yet whose sight your comforts once presented. But as this cruell fortune hath inuented (Sweete ioy) to roote thee vp, where she had sowen thee, So now (Seluagia) she hath ouerthrowen thee: Thy pleasures scarce begun, she hath tormented. Let me to time or to his changing take me, Let me with motions out of order leade me, Then I shall see how free my hart is to me. Then will I trust in hopes that not forsake me, When I haue staide her wheeles that ouertread me, And beaten downe the fates that doe vndoe me. [No more (O cruell Nymph) now hast thou prayed] No more (O cruell Nymph) now hast thou prayed Ynough in thy reuenge, prooue not thine ire On him that yeeldes, the fault is now apayed Vnto my cost: now mollifie thy dire, Hardnes and brest of thine so much obdured: And now raise vp (though lately it hath erred) A poore repenting soule, that in the obscured Darknes of thy obliuion lies enterred. For it fals not in that, that doth commend thee, That such a Swaine as I may once offend thee. If that the little sheepe with speede is flying From angrie Shepherd (with his wordes affraied) And runneth here and there with fearfull crying, And with great greefe is from the flocke estraied: But when it now perceiues that none doth follow, And all alone, so far estraying, mourneth, Knowing what danger it is in, with hollow And fainting bleates, then fearefull it returneth Vnto the flocke, meaning no more to leaue it, Should it not be a iust thing to receiue it? Lift vp these eies (Ismenia) which so stately To view me, thou hast lifted vp before me That libertie, which was mine owne but lately, Giue me againe, and to the same restore me: And that milde hart, so full of loue and pittie, Which thou didst yeeld to me, and euer owe me. Behold (my Nymph) I was not then so witty To knowe that sincere loue, that thou didst shew me: Now wofull man full well I knowe and rue it, Although it was too late before I knew it. How could it be (my enemie) say, tell me, How thou (in greater fault and errour being. Then euer I was thought) should'st thus repell me? And with new league and cruell title seeing Thy faith so pure and woorthy to be changed. And what is that Ismenia, that doth binde it To loue, whereas the same is most estranged, And where it is impossible to finde it? But pardon me, if herein I abuse thee, Since that the cause thou gau'st me doth excuse me. But tell me now what honour hast thou gained, Auenging such a fault by thee committed; And thereunto by thy occasion trained: What haue I done, that I haue not acquitted? Or what excesse, that is not amply paied, Or suffer more, that I haue not endured? What cruell minde, what angry brest displaied, With sauage hart, to fiercenes so adiured, Would not such mortall greefe make milde and tender, But that, which my fell Shepherdesse doth render? Now as I haue perceiued well thy reasons, Which thou hast had, or hast yet to forget me, The paines, the greefes, the guiltes of forced treasons, That I haue done, wherein thou first didst set me: The passions, and thine eares, and eies refusing To heare, and seeme, meaning to vndoe me: Cam'st thou to know, or be but once perusing Th' vnsought occasions, which thou gau'st vnto me, Thou should'st not haue wherewith to more torment me, Nor I to pay the fault my rashnes lent me. [How fond am I to hope for any rest] How fond am I to hope for any rest In endlesse plaints, vaine sighes, and bootelesse teares? The present now at hand to be exprest, Yet few to these, that, with ten thousand feares, I haue powr'd out vnto thy cruell eares. And if at any time my life did tend To other loues in earnest or in iest, This loue by that I neuer could offend, Bicause I did but then begin to prooue, And learne, how well Montanus I could loue. Then did I learne to loue, my selfe I taught To loue, by him, who lou'd me not againe: For I suspected that I should be brought Vnto thy loue (Montanus) when in vaine I loued him, that did my loue disdaine: I try'de (I say) my free and carelesse hart Of loue to taste some sorrow, that it sought: And let that Shepherd with his loue depart, That loues with thee, for all his paine and greefe Is but in vaine, when vaine is his releefe. Let none accuse me then if I disdaine Alanius loues, whose loues are but a showe, For I could neuer loue nor entertaine Any but thee, for whom I will bestowe My deerest life, since heauens will haue it soe. And if at any time I fein'd to like, I lik'd (I say) but how I did I knowe, For neuer any Shepherd els could strike My hart indeede, but thou, to whom I giue My faith kept for thee since I first did liue. Let burning sighes go forth and still increase, Let both mine eies become two strings of teares, Let accidents, repugnant to mine ease Arise, for thoughts, which now my minde for sweares, Shall neuer hurt that loue which now it beares: Let sorrow goe, and ill which way they will, And now let ioies returne which way they please, For where they are, there will I houer still, Since that no harme my purpose may reclame, Nor cruell death it selfe, although it came. [Foolish loue, ah foolish louer] Foolish loue, ah foolish louer, I for thee, thou for another. I am a foole, and seeme no lesse, For thee who will not be? For he's a foole I doe confesse, That is not one for thee: And yet this doth not well agree, To be a foolish louer, Or foole for her, that is a foole for louing of another. Now seeing thee, thou seest not mee, And diest for my foe, Eate me with sauce (that loueth thee) Of him thou louest soe: So shalt thou make me (to my woe) To be a foolish louer, And such a foole for louing thee as thou art for another. [Although my quiet it doth let] Although my quiet it doth let, Rather then blame discredit me, (For God forbid that I forget) Let me with wrong forgotten be. Not onely where obliuion raineth, There is no loue, nor can be none, Nay, where there is suspicion, There is no loue, but such as faineth; Great harme it is to loue, where set In bootelesse hopes, the minde they free, But God defend that I forget, Forgotten though a iest it bee. If that I loue, why then loue I, To sport or leaue to loue at all? For what more honor can befall, Then die for that, for which I die: To liue therefore and to forget, Is such a shamefull life I see, That I had rather loue one yet, Forgotten though to death I bee. [Shepherd, who can passe such wrong] Shepherd, who can passe such wrong And a life in woes so deepe? Which to liue is to too long, As it is too short to weepe. Greeuous sighes in vaine I waste, Leesing my affiance, and I perceiue my hope at last With a candle in the hand. What time then to hope among Bitter hopes, that euer sleepe? When this life is to too long, As it is too short to weepe. This greefe which I feele so rife, (Wretch) I doe deserue as hire, Since I came to put my life In the handes of my desire. Then cease not my plaints so strong, For (though life her course doth keepe) It is not to liue so long, As it is too short to weepe. [Weepe not my dolefull eies] Weepe not my dolefull eies, But if you weepe, thinke (at the lest) They tolde no trueth but lies, And then it may be you may rest. Since that imagination Doth cause so much in euery state, Thinke that she loues thee as of late, And thou shalt haue lesse passion. And if you will (mine eies) Haue ease, imagine then the best, And that they told you lies: And so perhaps you may haue rest. Thinke that she loues as well, As euer she did heretofore: But this sad men cannot restore, To thinke what once befell: Then mournfull eies, where lies Your helpe? Yet thinke of some at lest, If not, weepe still mine eies, Or make an end, and you shall rest. [My life (yoong Shepherdesse) for thee] My life (yoong Shepherdesse) for thee Of needes to death must post; But yet my greefe must stay with mee After my life is lost. The greeuous ill, by death that cured is Continually hath remedie at hand: But not that torment, that is like to this, That in slowe time, and fortunes meanes doth stand. And if this sorrow cannot be Ended with life (as most) What then doth this thing profit me, A sorrow wonne or lost? Yet all is one to me, as now I trie A flattring hope, or that that had not bene yet. For if to day for want of it I die, Next day I doe no lesse for hauing seene it. Faine would I die, to end and free This greefe, that kils me most If that it might be lost with me, Or die when life is lost. The end of the first book of Diana. The second Booke of Diana of George of Montemayor. [Waters that fall from top of these steepe Hils] Waters that fall from top of these steepe Hils, With such a noyse into these lowe deepe Vales, Why thinke you not of those, which from my Soule Continually distill my wearied Eies? And what's the cause of them? Vnluckie Time, In which hard fortune robbed all my Ioy. Loue gaue me hope of such a golden Ioy, That ther's no Shepherdesse in all these Hils, That had such cause to praise a happy Time: But after he did put me in these Vales Of swelling teares that fall from both mine Eies: Not to behold such greefe as kils my Soule. Such is the paine, that wounds a louing Soule, That in the end I know what thing is Ioy: O where shall I then turne my wearied Eies? If that the medowes, woods, the plaines, and Hils, The pleasant groues, and fountaines of the Vales, Still to my thoughts present so sweete a Time? Who would haue thought that such a happy Time Should be so fierce a torment to my Soule? Or cruell fortune banish me the Vale, Wherin all things were obiects of my Ioy? Vntill the hungrie woolfe, which to the Hill Ascending vp, was pleasant to mine Eies. But fortune now, what may my drenched Eies Behold, which saw their Shepherd many a Time Driuing his lambes before him downe this Hill? Whose name for ay shall rest within my Soule. O fortune foe vnto my former Ioy, How doe I languish in this irkesome Vale? But when so pleasant and so fresh a Vale Is not delightfull to my wearied Eies, And where I cannot finde content and Ioy: And hope not now to haue it any Time, See what extremes enuiron then my Soule: O that he came againe. O that sweete Hill: O highest Hils, and fresh and pleasant Vale, Where once my Soule did rest and both these Eies, Tell me shall I in Time haue so much Ioy? [To heare me wearied is the cleerest riuer] To heare me wearied is the cleerest riuer, Tedious I am to euery vale and mountaine: And now to heare (O loue, my sorrowes giuer) My plaining, wearied is each cristall fountaine. The Sicamour, the Oke, and Elme are wearie, Spring, Sommer, Autumne, and the winter season Hearing my cries are sworne not to be merry. With teares I melt these rocks: and yet all reason Of pitie (Tigresse) thou dost still deny me, When trees, and stones for greefe are dying by me. A bondslaue of a freeman thou hast made me, And of a man of reason, cleane contrarie: With life, and death, by turnes thou dost inuade me, And to tormenting greefe my soule dost carrie. Of affable, and one that liu'd so gayly, Made me thou hast to frowards disdaining: Of one, that did conuerse with all man daily, Made me thou hast their company refraining. Eies had I once, now blinded with desire: I was a man of flesh, but now of fire. What's this my hart, thy torments dost thou double? Tell me mine eies, and are you still a weeping? My soule, sufficeth not my passed trouble? My teares, and are ye yet in riuers steeping? My wandring wits, and are you not molested More then ynough with such incessant sorrow? And are ye not my senses also wrested From your right course, resting not euen nor morrow? How know I then, weepe, see, or feele this hower, When torments waste their force and seuerall power? Who made my Shepherdesses tresses twistall Of fine Arabian gold, not gilt-like shining: Her face of cleerest and of chosen christall, Her rubie lips, two rowes of pearle combining: Her dymond eies, like to those stars aboue all, Her necke, that whitest Allablaster stayneth, Her passing wit, inforcing vs to loue all: Her stately minde, that all our loues disdaineth. Why made shee not her hart of melting matter, Then of such marble stone so hard to batter? One day I do conforme me to my fortune, And to my griefe, that faire Diana causeth: Next day mine yll doth vex me, and importune My soule with thoughts of griefe that seldome pauseth: Cruell and fierce and inhumane I call her, And so there is no order in my sorrow: For afterwards in phrases I install her, What now I say, I do deny to morrow. And all is thus leading a life in anguish, Which soone mine eies may see by death to languish. [Goe now my thoughts, where one day you were going] Goe now my thoughts, where one day you were going, When neither fortune, nor my loue did lower: Now shall you see that changed day and hower, Your ioies decaied, and vncouth sorrowes growing? And in the glasse, where I was oft bestowing Mine eies, and in that sweete and pleasant flower, A sluggish drone vnwoorthely deuower That honie, which for me sometimes was flowing. And you shall see to whom I did surrender My subiect life, that causelesse did despise it: And though this ill no remedy can borrow, Yet tell her, that my minde did once ingender A feare of that, vvhich after to mine eyes yet She makes more plaine, to end my life in sorrow. [Contents of loue] Contents of loue, That come with so great paine, If that you come, why go you hence againe? Not fully come, But you begin to starte: Neuer with perfect some To nestle in a woefull heart. And will you now so soone depart, And leaue me in such paine? Then hence delights, and see me not againe. From you I flye, (Since you denie my sight) To make me know thereby The losse, if that I loose you quite. Then (since you do me such despite) Depart not griefe and paine, For when you goe, you soone returne againe. The song of the Nymph. Neere to the riuer bankes, with greene And pleasant trees on euery side, Where freest mindes would most haue beene, That neuer felt braue Cupids pride, To passe the day and tedious how'rs Amongst those painted meades and flow'rs. A certaine Shepheard full of woe (Syrenus call'd) his flockes did feede, Not sorowfull in outward showe, But troubled with such greefe indeede, As cruell loue is wont t'impart Vnto a painfull louing hart. This Shepherd euery day did die For loue he to Diana bare, A Shepherdesse so fine perdie, So liuely yoong and passing faire, Excelling more in beautious feature, Then any other humane creature. Who had not any thing, of all She had, but was extreme in her, For meanely wise none might her call, Nor meanely faire, for he did erre, If so he did: but should deuise Her name of passing faire and wise. Fauours on him she did bestowe, Which if she had not, then (be sure) He might haue suffred all that woe, Which afterwards he did endure When he was gone, with lesser paine, And at his comming home againe. For when in deede the hart is free From suffring paine or torments smart, If wisedome doth not ouersee, And beareth not the greater part, The smallest greefe and care of minde Doth make it captiue to their kinde. Neere to a riuer swift and great (That famous Ezla had to name) The carefull Shepherd did repeate The feares he had by absence blame, Which he suspect, where he did keepe And feede his gentle lambes and sheepe. And now sometimes he did behold His Shepherdesse, that thereabout Was on the mountaines of that old And ancient Leon, seeking out From place to place the pastures best, Her lambes to feede, her selfe to rest. And sometimes musing, as he lay, (When on those hils she was not seene) Was thinking of that happy day, When Cupid gaue him such a Queene Of beautie, and such cause of ioy, Wherein his minde he did imploy. Yet saide (poore man) when he did see Himselfe so sunke in sorrowes pit, The good that loue hath giuen mee I onely doe imagine it: Bicause this neerest harme and trouble Hereafter I should suffer double. The Sunne, for that it did decline, The carelesse man did not offend With firie beames, which scarce did shine, But that which did of loue depend, And in his hart did kindle fire Of greater flames and hot desire. Him did his passions all inuite, The greene leaues blowne with gentle winde, Cristalline streames with their delite, And Nightingales were not behinde, To helpe him in this louing verse, Which to himselfe he did rehearse. Syrenus his song. A farewell they departure call, That loues delight did neuer knowe, But that that endes with life and all, I terme a greefe and endlesse woe. God graunt therefore that all that space My lingring life I might sustaine, Vntill I see againe the place Where my true hart doth still remaine. For onely thinking to depart, The thought doth make me so afraid, That it must kill my trembling hart With force of such great greefe apaid. Syrenus did these verses sing, And on his Rebecke sweetely play, So far from ioy or ioyfull thing, And from contentment any way: That he could not pronounce his minde For weeping, which was left behinde. And now bicause he would not be In fault, (if that his greefe and paine The accents and the verse, which he Pronounc't, did hinder or restraine) That which his willing minde did let, His hart to end did not forget. But after that the Shepherd had With moornefull voice these verses soong, He sawe Diana come so sad, And yet so faire, so fresh and yong, That where she cast her starlike eies, With colours braue the meades she dies. Her face as faire and fresh as flower, And yet so sorrowfull againe, That none could iudge at that same hower, Whether her greefe and inward paine, Or her braue beautie did surpasse? In her so faire, and sad (alas.) Thus comming many a time she staide, Casting vnto the ground her eies, So comfortlesse and so dismade, And sometimes vp into the skies, That there they hung with greefe in steede Of two bright stars, like stars in deede. Saying with greater greefe of minde (Then humane thought can once conceaue) Since such annoy in ioy I finde: From this day (loue) well maist thou leaue Thy ioies vnto thy selfe to keepe, And me, to feede no more but sheepe. The cause of all her greefe and woe, Which she by absence wrong did feare, There did she very cleerely showe, And if she wasted many a teare, Aske but those blasing eies, which still With passions did Syrenus kill. If that her loue had euer peere, Her goodnes there hid not the same: And if that absence cost her deere, Or feared her before it came, This song aboue each other thing Can tell, which she with teares did sing. Dianas song. O Loue thou gau'st me not the ioy, That in sweete presence I did finde, But that in absence the annoy Should seeme more greeuous to my minde. Thou giuest ease, thou giuest rest, But not to giue content but guile, And that the suffrance in my brest, Might be but idle for a while. See loues inuentions, neuer scant In presence to affoord releefe, Bicause in absence I should want Defence against my mortall greefe. Now faire Diana being come Vnto the place, where she did spie Her loue, she would haue spoken some Few wordes, but greefe did them denie: And wofull man, he nothing spake, Though he did oft a semblant make. How much they had betweene them both To talke, their eies made manifest, Declaring that, which very loth Lay in their secret harts and brest, With that milde countenance and show, With which they spake not long agoe. They both together downe did sit Vnder a flowrie Myrtle tree, One by the hand the other yet Did take, for ouer come was he By her, and she by him againe, Both in their mutuall passions slaine. For that great pleasure and delight Of seeing one an other there, And greefe, to leese that happie sight, So wrought their harts with ioy and feare, That to each other neither could Vtter a word, though faine they would. Some other times they met againe Vpon this banke with other passions, Which meetings they did entertaine And celebrate with other fashions: Not, as in times then gone and past, For of this sort, this was the last. A strange effect of mighty loue, To see two loue in such degree, That greater torments they did proue, When either did each other see, Then when they were remooued quite From ioying in each others sight. Syrenus seeing now the howre, When greefe of parting was to come, He had no patience nor no powre To speake, but straight was striken dumbe: Nor of his teares he could get leaue To vtter what he did conceaue. His Shepherdesse he did behold, His Shepherdesse beheld againe The man, whose hart with feare was cold, Speaking to her with cruell paine: Indeede his Greefe for him did speake, For he could not whose hart did breake. Alas Diana, who would haue said, When I was in most heauie case, Or who would haue imagined, But that, when I did view thy face, My very soule then most opprest, Should by that sight haue found some rest. In any time who would haue thought, That any thing (sweete Mistresse) might A greater greefe or paine haue brought Vnto my soule with more despight, Then thy sweete presence and thy sight, (My soueraine ioy and chiefe delight) Who would haue thought, but that againe Those eies, when that they viewed me, Should haue dissolu'd, and burst in twaine The knot of all my miserie: Which my mishaps (so long assured) By any way might haue procured. Faire Mistresse then behold my state, And how mishap my soule doth chace, For if I died but of late With great desire to see thy face, Now doe I die by seeing thee Present and not thou killest me. And thinke not that this passion drawes To want of louing thee, for none Hath bene so firme, but now bicause I come vnto this meade with mone To take my leaue, where I before To see thee came, but now no more. My soule I would haue giuen faine This day, which thou hast conquer'd soe, Not to haue seene thee in this plaine (Although no other life I knowe) Onely to misse (I care not how) The greefe of this departure now. And giue me leaue (faire Shepherdesse) To thinke, that thou canst not deny it, But thou dost feele my heauinesse In that degree, as I doe trie it: For in thy presence t'is not such A matter to presume so much. If then, Diana, it be so, Tell me, how can I now depart? How dost thou suffer me to go When each doth carry others hart? Or how doe I come hither yet, To take my farewell without let? O my faire Shepherdesse againe No reason can I yeeld thee why, Nor how of thee I should complaine, As thou shalt haue continually Absent, when I am gone from thee O, neuer to remember me. I knowe right well it is not thow, That mak'st me to depart, and lesse, My purest faith constraines me now, (For needes I must the same confesse) And if I should but tell and show it, Who doth the same, I doe not know it. Thus full of paine and bitter teares, And sighing, which he neuer spar'd, The Shepherd to her louing eares Did speake these words which you haue heard. And hearing them, in minde she kept Them, and full bitterly she wept. To answere him she went about A thousand times, but could not doe it, For still her greefe did put her out, And so she could not frame her to it. But then for her, her loue so stable An answere shapt (her toong vnable.) My friend in such a time I am, Where I shall speake more then I would, That though mine ill, which lately came Cannot be vttered (as it should:) Yet (Shepherd) would I thinke it good, To hold my peace if that I could. But woe is me, that this great ill I come to tell, and publish it In such a time against my will, That it auailes not any whit Thy iourney to delay a while, Nor these my torments to beguile. Why goest thou hence (O Shepherd) tell: Why wilt thou now forsake me heere? So full of greefe alone to dwell, Where time, and place, and all the deere, And sweetest ioyes of this our loue Shall neuer from my minde remooue. What shall I feele (vnhappy wight) Comming vnto this pleasant greene, When I shall say (Farewell sweete sight) Heere haue I my Syrenus seene; Heere did we sit, heere did we play, Discoursing with him day by day. Behold if that it will not bee A daily sorrow, when these bankes I doe beholde, and cannot see Thy selfe, where goodly trees in rankes And in their barke my name to stand Carued so finely by thy hand. And see if any greefe or dole Is like to this, when I behold The place so sorrowfull and sole, Where deere Syrenus with a cold And trembling feare thou didst protest Thy greefe to me within thy brest. If then thy hart (so cruell now) Is mollified by falling teares, How melts it not for greefe, and how Consumes it not with many feares, At this occasion (so vniust) To leaue my comfort in the dust? Then Shepherd weepe not, for in vaine Thy plentious teares and sighes are spent, For he that doth lament the paine, In whom it lieth to preuent, I thinke he is not sound of wit, If such a folly he commit. But my Syrenus pardon me, If my sharpe wordes thine eares offend, And giue me leaue to speake with thee In this faire meade, where (cruell frend) Thou leau'st me not one little how'r With my poore selfe, nor in my pow'r. For I will not, (nor yet in iest) Shepherd from thee my selfe absent, Then goe not, wilt thou? say at lest, And to these eies, that euer lent Such helpe to thee, some pitie keepe, And sorrow now to see them weepe. Syrenus answered her againe, Alas thou canst not choose but knowe. By all these teares I spend in vaine, If that I doe desire to goe; But thou commaundest me to stay, And my hard hap to goe away. Thy matchlesse beautie when I see, (Mistresse) then am I euer bound Willing at thy commaund to be: But wofull Shepherd when I found My hap to beare so great a sway, Of force I must the same obay. Then my departure forced is, But by no fault that I did make, And credit me (sweete Nymph) in this, That all the world I would forsake, In these faire meades with thee to wende, Where now I see my ioyes doe ende. My Master that great Shepherd is He, that doth make me to depart, Whom I may see, and wish that his Exempted thoughtes and freest hart Braue loue may punish with such paine, As at this parting I sustaine. I would to God, my going hence (Onely to pleasure thee this day) By shewing of my iust pretence, Lay in my power anyway: As Mistresse in thy fairest handes My life and death at mercie standes. But credit me, it is in vaine, (To that which euer I doe trie, And that thou think'st as much againe) That neuer in my handes did lie Ought in the world, that might but giue Any content to make me liue. Another course well might I take, And leaue my flocke to stray about, I might my Shepherd to forsake And seeke some other Master out: But if the end I marke and see, This with our loue doth not agree. For if I doe forsake my flocke, Which vnto me he did commend, And take in hand some other stocke Of cattell or of sheepe to tend, Tell me, how can I come vnseene Without thy harme vpon this greene? And if the force of this great flame My willing presence heere detaines, It is a signe, that I doe frame My thoughts on thee, and so it staines Thy honour, which to saile is sent, Onely (sweetelife) for my content. And if (they say) I doe imploy (Faire Shepherdesse) my loue on thee, And that againe I doe enioy Thy loue so frankly giuen me. Thee they condemne, thou dost sustaine The onely losse, and I no gaine. The Shepherdesse at this same season This answer with great greefe did make, O Shepherd tell me now, what reason Thou hast my presence to forsake? Since that in loue there is no sound Of any reason to be found. A signe it is (not good to vse) By daily proofe we see the same, That he that can so well excuse His absence from his louing dame, If he were gone out of her sight, He would account the same but light. Ah greefe, since going now away, I knowe not what will chaunce to thee, And forced if I am to stay Nor then what shall become of me? Nor there if thou wilt thinke (my deere) That one did see another heere. I knowe not if I am deceau'd, By hauing laide before thine eies This painfull greefe that hath bereau'd Me of my ioy, where now it dies, But that which to my harme must be, I knowe shall be most sure in me. Thou greeu'st not at my little ease, Go Shepherd then, take shipping now, With brittle barke the Ocean seas, In steede of these greene fieldes goe plow: Since of my teares these seas (alas) So quickly thou dost ouerpasse. The heauens from stormes thy barke defend, From rockes, from wrecke, and swallowing sand, And that thou mai'st (my sweetest frend) Safely arriue in wished land: And fortune better deale with thee, Then at this time thou dost with me. Alas for very greefe I die, Seeing mine eies to take their leaue Of all their sweete contents, whereby This greefe, and teares doe so bereaue My toong of speech, that faine I would Speake more vnto thee if I could. And Shepherd I doe wish besides, That these two eies (which weepe in vaine) Before that death my life deuides, May see thee heere yet once againe: And though their harme thou dost procure, They wish thee yet all good be sure. He answered her, my Mistresse deere, A mischeefe neuer comes alone: A mortall greefe doth not appeere Without more companie, and one That is more mightie then the rest, And this it is that wounds my brest. For though I see I must depart From my sweete life, (since from thy sight) Not halfe so much it greeues my hart, As seeing thee in such a plight For my departure, and sustaine Such greefe indeede and cruell paine. But if those eies I doe forget, (The mirrours of my happinesse) I wish that God aboue may let Me not this wished life possesse, Or if my thoughtes imploied be (Sweete life) on any but on thee. And if that any beautie else Shall make new motions in my minde, (Though it be neuer so excelse) Or in the same content I finde, For one small howre of such content, I wish eternall punishment. And if my firmest faith for strange And forren loue, that may befall, Or my sincerest loue I change, I wish that fortune may recall Me to a life most desperate, Throwing me downe from this estate. O sweetest Mistresse of my hart, Prescribe no time for my retourne: For it doth kill me to depart, And I shall neuer cease to mourne, And passe the greatest greefe and paine, Vntill these eies see thee againe. She answered him, (my deere Syrenus) If that I shall in any day (Though now our destinies doe weane vs) Forget thee, then I wish the May And freshest flowers in this meade May die, when on them I doe treade. And if on any man aliue, But onely thee (my loue) I thinke, I wish, that, (when my sheepe I driue Vnto the riuer streames to drinke) Comming vnto them, at my sight, The waters may be dry'd vp quite. Shepherd, receiue this little string Made of my haire for thy sweete sake, Bicause by seeing of the thing, Thou maist remember thou did'st take Possession of my louing hart, And them, with which thou deest depart. And this ring with thee thou shalt beare, With hand in hand, as thou dost see, Which for my sake I pray thee weare, That though our bodies parted bee, Nothing shall part, not death alone, Two soules vnited both in one. He saide with thee what shall I leaue, Naught haue I but this Sheepehooke heere: The which I pray thee to receiue, And Rebecke, to the which (my deere) Thou saw'st me sing in this greene meade, And play and many a daunce to leade. To sound of which (my Shepherdesse) A thousand songs to thee I soong, Singing of thy great worthinesse (Too high for my base song and toong) And of our loues and of my passions, And of my sweetest lamentations. Each one imbrac't the other fast, And this (I thinke) the first time was, And (as I gesse) it was the last, Bicause those times did change and passe: And loue with time did change and varie From that, which once they both did carie. For though Diana felt great paine For absence of her louer deere, Yet in the same she found againe A remedie, as did appeere, For after he the seas did passe, She to another married was. [O grant me then this short content] O grant me then this short content, For forc'd I am to thee to flie: My sighes do not make thee relent, Nor teares thy hart do mollifie. Nothing of mine doth giue thee payne, Nor thou think'st of no remedie: Mistresse how long shall I sustaine such ill, as still thou dost applie? In death there is no helpe, be sure, But in thy will, where it doth lie: For all those illes which death doth cure, Alas, they are but light to trie: My troubles do not trouble thee, Nor hope to touch thy soule so nie: O from a will that is so free, What should I hope, when I do crie? How can I mollifie that braue And stonie hart, of pittie drie? Yet Mistresse turne those eies (that haue No peeres) shining like stars in skie: But turne them not in angrie sort, If thou wilt not kill me thereby: Though yet in anger, or in sport, Thou killest onely with thine eie. A Sonnet. [My painefull yeeres impartiall Loue was spending] My painefull yeeres impartiall Loue was spending In vaine and booteles hopes my life appaying, And cruell Fortune to the world bewraying Strange samples of my teares that haue no ending. Time euerie thing to truth at last commending, Leaues of my steps such markes, that now betraying And all deceitfull trusts shall be decaying, And none haue cause to plaine of his offending. Shee, whom I lou'd to my obliged power, That in her sweetest loue to me discouers Which neuer yet I knew (those heauenly pleasures,) And I do saie, exclaiming euery hower, Do not you see, what makes you wise, O Louers? Loue, Fortune, Time, and my faire Mystresse treasures. A Song. [That sweetest harme I doe not blame] That sweetest harme I doe not blame, First caused by thy fairest eies, But greeue, bicause too late I came, To know my fault, and to be wise. I neuer knew a worser kinde of life, To liue in feare, from boldnesse still to cease: Nor woorse then this, to liue in such a strife, Whether of both, to speake, or holde my peace? And so the harme I doe not blame, Caused by thee, or thy faire eies: But that to see how late I came, To knowe my fault, and to be wise. I euer more did feare, that I should knowe Some secret things, and doubtfull in their kinde, Bicause the surest things doe euer goe Most contrarie vnto my wish and minde. And yet by knowing of the same, There is no hurt, But it denies My remedie, Since late I came, To knowe my fault, and to be wise. [My passion (Loue) thou dost disdaine] My passion (Loue) thou dost disdaine, But God keepe thee from such a paine. I am of Loue disdained, And Fortunes wheele doth broose me, I care not now to loose me, And hope not to be gained. So care to care is chained By Fortune and by Loue againe: But God keepe thee from such a paine. In playntes Loue entertained My hart (such sport to choose me) And fortune thus vndooes me, To make me thinke vnfained, That Time a change maintained, But Both do still my greefes ordaine, But God keepe thee from such a paine. [Saie Shepherdesse, what hath depriued thee] Saie Shepherdesse, what hath depriued thee Of curtesie and ioy, Since that so merrie thou were wount to be? The deere remembrance of my passed gladnes In middes of all my present greefe and paine, Woe to my soule, that feeles it with such sadnes, If long in such a state it doth remaine: And since that time hath changed (to be plaine) A Shepherd to offend and trouble me, Merrie and pleasant I could neuer be. [Mistresse thou hast forgotten me] Mistresse thou hast forgotten me, But more I loue and honor thee. Haples, I see I am forgot, And yet I know no reason why, To whom thy faith thou dost apply. And tak'st from whom thou dost not wot: Being belou'd, he loues thee not, And Mistresse thou dost not loue me, But more I loue and honor thee. Me thinkes I do behold with pride Those eies (my ioyes not long ago) And for thou wilt not seeme so, Thy fairest face from me dost hide: And that I saie to thee, beside, Mistresse lift vp those eies to me, For more I loue and honor thee. The end of the second booke of Diana. The third Booke of Diana of George of Montemayor. Arsenius his letter. Faire Shepherdesse whose hap and fare, That such it be, it is Gods will: Let not such grace and beautie rare Decay, or be imployed ill. And whose milde lambes and marked sheepe Thou maist behold (with merrie cheere) By flockes increase, where they doe keepe On tops of these greene hillocks heere. Harke to a Shepherdes wretched crie, Vnto himselfe so great a foe, As for thy sweetest sake to die, He findes he doth it well bestowe: Turne thy deafe cares vnto my smart, And mollifie thy hard pretences, And now begin to put thy hart Into the handes of thy sweete sences. Turne these two faire and cruell eies Vnto this haplesse Shepherd Swaine: Thy flocke regarde not, but his cries, And thinke a little on his paine, Let that but mooue and change thy will: To thinke thereof, I pray thee deine yet, And not to remedie mine ill, But to behold how I susteine it. How often hast thou come and leade Vnto the field thy flocke and dams, How many times vnto the meade Hast thou brought forth thy pretie lambes? That I told not my little ease, That I became a foole for thee, But better had I held my peace, So little it auailed me. That which I feele for thy sweete sake With what wordes shall I now declare? Or with what knowledge shall I make My faith but knowen and heauie care? What humane senses shall suffice To feele that paine, and that vnrest, Which for thy sake Loue did deuise To giue me (though I tell it best.) Why dost thou hide thy selfe from me, Since thou dost knowe it very cleere, That present when I am with thee, Most absent from thee I appeere: I, in suspences to enfolde me Being where thy faire beauties are: And thou, when that thou dost beholde me, From seeing me then art thou far. To shewe me likewise thou dost knowe (To mocke me when thou dost pretend) Things from thy thought, which euer goe, And so deceiue me in the end. See then who greater loue can giue, Or greater grounded loue in hand, That my deceiued thought must liue With that thou mak'st it vnderstand. Behold th' extreme wherein I am, Seeing my good in doubtfull state, That silly creatures I became, (Lesse then myselfe) to emulate: For, for the bird the winde doth beare, And fish that in the waues doe liue, For their sweete freedome euery where My vnderstanding I would giue. A change of thousand times I see, And nouels euery day doe raine: Minds change from that they wont to bee, Obliuions doe reuiue againe. In euery thing there is great change, The which I neuer saw in thee, Whereby thou maist perceiue how strange, And vaine my hope is vnto me. The other day thou didst passe by, Feeding thy flocke vpon the hill: For greefe I sighed somewhat high; Meaning thereby to thee no ill: A lambe the head then lift vp, that it Did heare, and did some pitie feele, And thou didst fling thy sheepehooke at it: See what a hardned hart of steele. Could'st thou not (armed with such power) After such long time killing me Helpe me a day or but an hower? If that doth seeme too much to thee, Doe it to see how I may proue Or how with fauours, that ensue, In better sort intreate this loue: Then after kill my soule anew. I doe desire to change estate From paine to paine, and not to pleasure: Nor yet to change from loue to hate, And all in one degree and measure. And though the ill in substance should Be but all one and of one sort: Yet in the circumstance I would That more or lesse it did import. For that may be of such behoofe, And Mistresse, so much it may doe That loue may giue thee greater proofe, Then it hath giu'n thee hitherto. And whom an ill and firmest loue Can neither greeue, normollifie, It may be such a greefe may moue Thee, of some greater qualitie. Vnto the meade if thou dost goe, Vnto the riuer or the plaine, Then am I diligent to knowe, If thou art gone or come againe. If angrie, when I follow thee, Or mocke me, if behinde I stay: See then how feare doth trouble me, And what extremes I doe essay. To Syluia then thy deerest friend I goe (to seeke a poore releefe) To know if (haply) in the end Thou hast inform'd her of my greefe. But nothing when of thee she speakes, Then doe I say, this cruell foe Vnto her good companion breakes Nothing of me, nor of my woe. Some other times I watch the place, To heare the singing in the night, With singular and sweetest grace, A thousand songs of great delight: For I doe heare them one by one, And thou seek'st out the worst of all, And euer from thy mouth heare none That in loue matters doe befall. I sawe thee yet the other day, Talking with Maudline, who in fine To thee her sorrow did bevvray: O would to God it had bene mine. I thought thou wouldst not long defer (Poore soule) to cheere her heauy hart, But laughing, thou didst answere her. It is a iest, in loue's no smart. Thou left'st her weeping all in vaine, And I came thither by and by: Of thy hard hart she did complaine, And sighing, this I did reply: No wonder, for this cruell one Delights not onely, that aboue All others she loues not alone, But that all others should not loue. Some other times I thee espie Talking with other Shepherdesses, All is of feastes and brauerie, Who daunceth best, and like digresses: That this maide hath a seemely grace, And he this, or that interest: But if of loue they touch an ace, Then straight thou turn'st it to a iest. Beware yet, liue not too secure, For in braue loue and fortunes art, There is not anything lesse sure Then such a free exempted hart. And it may be with after woe That cruell loue will subiect thee, To one that will intreate thee soe, (Cruell) as thou intreatest me. But (if that fall out to thy cost) God graunt the same may neuer bee, And first I wish my life were lost, Rather then such a thing to see. For this poore hart which in my brest Is burning in so strange a fire, Feares more thy harme and thy vnrest, Then it respects her owne desire. A Sonnet. [In this cleere Sunne with golden beames that shineth] In this cleere Sunne with golden beames that shineth, In this most high diuine and rare perfection, In this sweete soule and figure, that refineth Our age with ioyes, with treasures and affection. O blinding light and face each harts subiection, Where beauties store to pities want inclineth: Sweete words, but hard condition of reiection; Sweete lookes, yet sight that many sorrowes shrineth. For these sweete Mistresse, I am thus enwrapped, For these I feare to see mine owne desire, And passe the time in thinking of thy treasures. A case most strange, effects that neuer happed, That seeing thee, I see my greatest pleasures, And harmes, when that to see thee I require. [To see thee I lift vp my happie eies] To see thee I lift vp my happie eies, And hauing seene thee, cast them downe againe. For further to proceede the same denies: Nor other ioy but thy loue to containe. What greater glory is there then to view thee, If that he knew the sight that he did see, For neuer was there any one that knew thee, That could be wearie of beholding thee, And though he could not knowe thee any wise As well as I haue knowen thee to my paine, Yet should he be besides himselfe, if dies Not at the least, to see thee once againe. If that my erring pen did others praise It was but trid, I see, vpon the lest, For they were all but papers of essaies Of that, wherewith thou truly wert possest. And if (before I lou'd thee) with surmise, My pen hath for some other writ in vaine, It was not for bicause I sawe her eies, But hop't it should see such a Soueraine. Nature in framing thee did so excell And shew'd so braue a skill and suttle art, That one of thy perfections serued well Beautie to thousand others to impart. She that to thee is like in any wise In least of all I sawe in thee so plaine: To passe no further she may well suffice, Nor he, that sees thee but must loue containe. Who sees thee as God made thee, and hath seene An other thing that's faire and of delight, He thinkes, he sees a thing that would haue beene Thy selfe in any thing, if that it might: But if he sees thee with such perfect eies, And (Mistresse) as I sawe thee, then againe There's no compare (compare for it denies) Nor glorie, but thy sweete loue to containe. [Loue passed by me with his bowe vnarm'd] Loue passed by me with his bowe vnarm'd, His eies cast downe, milde, gentle, modest gay, And (carelesse) left me then behinde vnharm'd: How small a time did I this ioye essaie? For presently enuious Fortune saide, Staie loue, why passest thou so soone awaie? Foorthwith the blinde boye turn'd to me, and staide Angry to see himselfe so checkt with blame, For ther's no blame, where his hot fire is laide: Cupid was blinde, but well he spide his game: So blinded be he, that he may see none, That did so blinde my wit, and sence enflame: O that I might reuenge my selfe of one That wisheth harme to all, and will not free (With his consent) not one poore hart alone: Straight did the traytour arme his bowe, and he with poysoned shaft did pierce my carelesse hart, Which in his bowe he put, and aym'd at me: Fortune vnarm'd did take me, for his parte Loue neuer plaies, nor workes not any feate, But on free soules, exempted from his darte: A hardned hart his arrow brake hart with heate, And brake a neuer subiect freedome, so That I did yeeld, and his content was great: O sole free quiet life that I forgo, O meadowe seene so oft with freest eies, Cursed be Loue, his arrowes, and his bowe: Nowe follow loue, and what he doth deuise, Come from securitie to greatest care, And passe from rest, to thousand miseries: See now how that a carefull hart doth fare, Which lately was without suspect or thought Subiect to be to such a tyrants snare. O soule with teares vndone and brought to nought, Now learne to suffer, since you learn'd to see, But what auailes, if this my Fortune wrought? O wretched eies (if with this terme he be Not angry) whom you savve vvith free consent, Where haue you put and plac'd my libertie? O meadovves, groues, and vvoods of svveete content, Which bred so free a hart as I had heere, So great an ill vvhy did you not preuent? Svvift running brooke, and riuer pure and cleere, Where once my flocke vvere wont to drinke their fill, O euery season of the passing yeere, Why haue you put me in a state so ill? Since onely I did loue you, and these plaines, And this most pleasant vale, and greenest hill. Heere did I mocke a thousand Shepherd swaines: Who now will laugh at me, when they shall knovv, That novv I doe begin to feele their paines. They are not ils of Loue, that vvound me soe, For if they vvere, then should I passe them all, As thousands, vvho haue died in Cupids vvoe. Fortune it is, that turnes, and makes me fall From euery meane occasion, path, and way, Wherby I might but shew my painfull thrall. How can the causer of my passion (say) Helpe them, if that their paine he neuer knowes, But there's no loue, where reason beareth sway, To how much ill is fortune drawing those, Whom she makes loue? since nothing can restore (Sea, earth nor Sunne, moone, stars, nor any showes) Or giue delight, vnlesse one loue before. And all is thus, and wretched thus am I, Whom time perswades and hinders more and more. Cease now my verse, since loue with angrie eie Beholds, how soone of him I doe complaine, And for my harmes doe craue his remedie. Complaine not oft for feare of his disdaine, Now hold your peace, since I seale vp my wordes, And when you see Loues fell, and angrie vaine, Cease, for Loues wroth no remedie affoordes. The end of the third booke The fourth Booke of Diana of George of Montemayor. [Well let her life that enters heere be waighed] Well let her life that enters heere be waighed, And if she hath not chastitie estranged, And she that loues, or Loues lawes hath essaied, If for anothers loue she hath not changed: And if from former faith she hath not straied, And kept her first true loue, and hath not ranged: May enter heere into Dianas temple, Whose soueraigne grace to such appeeres most gentle. [The authours of subiections] The Nymphes. The authours of subiections Fortune and Loue, and of most peeuish fashions, Aboue the moone affections Doe place, and hard reiections, And in the same extremest paines and passions. The Shepherdes. Lesse may he vaunt and boast For ioy, whom Loue did neuer yet molest, Then he, that loueth most, And fauours euer lost, Since they that suffer more are euer best. The Nymphes. If Loues extremes releeue you, And did not gainsay reason, as we view them, Perhaps we would beleeue you: But seeing how they greeue you, Happy are we that can so well eschew them. The Shepherdes. The hardest things the stoute And valiant persons euer take in hand: And that of greatest doubt Braue courage brings about, For t'is no honour small things to withstande. The Nymphes. The Louer well doth see, To fight it out, it is not Loues intent With magnanimitie: In torments he must be Of those, that suffring them are most content. The Shepherdes. If any ioy we sought By any ill of Loue which we obtaine, Ill cannot be the thought Vnto the passion brought: But he's more happy that endures more paine. The Nymphes. The best estate and fare, Where he doth see himselfe that loueth best, Brings nothing els but care: And yet doth neuer spare With flames to burne the dame and seruants brest: And he that's fauour'd most, Is changed in the twinkling of an eie: For with disfauours tost, And in obliuion lost, It kils his hart and makes his ioyes to die. The Shepherdes. To leese a good estate By falling from it, is a greefe and paine: Blamelesse is Loue, but fate It is, and Fortunes hate, That no exception makes from his disdaine: Vniust and far vnfit Is death, if Loue doth say that we shall liue, If death it promis'd yet, No fault he doth commit: For in the ende his promise he doth giue. The Nymphes. Fierce Loue they doe excuse, That finde themselues entangled with his fetter: And blame those that refuse Him, but of these to chuse The blamed mans estate is far the better. The Shepherdes. Faire Nymphes, it is denied The free and bond with one toong to debate, Liue men and those that died, The loued, and defied, All speake according to their owne estate. [I am Cid th' honour of Spaine] I am Cid th' honour of Spaine, If that any more could bee In my workes thou shalt see. [Hernand Gonçales of Castile I am] Hernand Gonçales of Castile I am In number the first Earle, and endlesse praise, The Spanish Scepters honor, since the same With my braue deedes so highly I did raise, My valour and my manhood golden Fame Can tell, that sawe it, wherefore she displaies My high deedes in eternall memorie, As tels you the Castilian historie. [Bernard of Carpio I am] Bernard of Carpio I am, The Pagans terror, and their smart: An honour to the Christian name, Since that my handes aduaunc't the same By valour of my stoutest hart: Fame, iust it is not thou conceale My matchlesse deedes from tender yeeres, But nothing if thou wilt reueale, To Ronçes-Vales I appeale, That sometimes was of the twelue Peeres. [My greatest valours they shall see] My greatest valours they shall see, Which knewe them not, whereby againe I onely haue deseru'd to bee Surnamed (The great Capitaine) And in strange landes, and in our owne I purchased so great a fame, That my exploites are held and knowne To be far greater then my name. [I am Fonseca whose braue historie] I am Fonseca whose braue historie Europe doth knowe, and doth so much commend, (Whose life though ended) yet my memorie Enroll'd by liuing fame shall neuer end. My soueraigne King I serued, and did beare My countrey loue, and not in fained showe, I neuer did leaue of for seruile feare To keepe that holy lawe, which euery where The seruant doth vnto his master owe. [Don Luys of Villanoua I am named] Don Luys of Villanoua I am named, And from the great Marquesse of Tranz descended, My valour and renowne (with praise proclamed In Italie, Fraunce, Spaine) is far extended. Bicorb, an ancient house my state is framed, That fortune to a hart hath now commended So high, sans peere, and that so much surmonnteth, As to commaund a world, it smally counteth. Orpheus his song. Harke Felismena to the sweetest song Of Orpheus, whose loue hath bene so high, Suspend thy greefe (Seluagia) somewhat long, Whilst now I sing, that once for loue did die: Forget (Belisa) now thy woefull wrong, And to my voice sweete Nymphes your eares apply: That lost his eies, to beauties blaze then turning, And Shepherdes, cease a while your amorous mourning. I will not speake (for God forbid the same) Of that most heauie processe of mine ils, Nor when I so did sing, that I did tame Wilde beastes and birdes, and mooued trees and hils: Nor when I did suspend th' infernall flame, Nor when I sawe Pluto, nor that, that kils My soule with greefe, when I lookt backe to see, If that Euridice did follow me. But I will sing with pure and sweetest voice Of those perfections, and that grace display, That wisedome, wit and beautie of such choice, Of those who doe illustrate Spaine this day. Then see her (Nymphes) whose beautie doth reioice Vs all: her great Diana, and her gay And goodly traine, on whom both Gods and men Cannot ynough imploy their toongs and pen. Lift vp your eies this Lady to beholde, That heere is sitting in this highest chaire, With scepter neere to her and crowne of golde, And angrie fortune by her on the staire: This is the star that Spaines light did enfolde, Whose absence now her glory doth impaire: Her name is Lady Mary that hath beene Of Hungarie, Boeme, and of Austrie Queene. The next that sits to her, is Lady Iane Princesse of Portugall and of Castille The Infant, and from whom fortune had tane The crowne and scepter by her turning wheele: And vnto whom death was so inhumane, That in her selfe great wonder she doth feele, To see how soone she did stretch forth her hands On her, that was the light of Lusitans. Behold (faire Nymphes) that Lady Mary great And soueraigne Infant of her Portugall: Whose grace and beautie hath this day a seate, Where humane thought could neuer reach at all: Behold, though cruell fortune there doth threat: Her wisedome yet doth count of her but small: For time, and death, and destinie cannot Conquere her goodnes, vertues, and her lot. Those two that are by her on either side, Whose beauties Titans brightnesse doe offend: Their sleeues of gold, their gownes of damaske tide With pearle, and where faire Emerauldes depend: Their curled golden lockes, wauing so wide Vpon their shoulders, loose that doe descend: Daughters they are of th' Infant Lusitane: Duarta the valiant, and great Cristiane. Those two great Dutchesses of worthy fame, For beauties prize in either of our Spaines Which there you see to life set out in frame, With grace, and features, that all others staines Of Sessa and Najare each hath her name: Whose companie Diana not disdaines For their exceeding beautie, and desartes, Discretion, wisedome, and all other partes. Behold a golden Phœnix all alone: A rare perfection neuer seene before, Wisedome, as like was not in any one, Beautie, and grace, where neuer could be more. She that puls fortune from her vaunting throne, And hath her subiect to her will and lore: Great Lady Leonore Manuell hath to name, The Lusitane light that doth the world inflame. The Lady Luise Carillo, that in Spaine Hath made Mendoças blood of such renowne: Whose beautie, and braue grace hath in a chaine Cupid himselfe, for loue of her cast downe: She's waiting still vpon our Goddesse traine: For chastitie worthie to weare a crowne. Of faire and honest an example heere, And of them all a mirrour bright and cleere. Behold a sweete perfection and a rare, Of her, whom fame her selfe doth greatly feare: Behold a passing beautie, sans compare, Founded in grace and wisedome euery wheare: That both with reason binde to loue and care. For in her doth the lest part beautie beare. Lady Eufrase of Guzman is her name, Worthy to be eternized with fame. That matchlesse beautie sweete and peregrine, Not seene in any, but in her alone, Which euery wit and soule doth so refine With holy loue, as like was neuer none: Apparelled with Crimson, that doth shine With flowres of gold, and pearle that there are sowne. The Lady Mary Aragon her name: The world doth know, and heauen doth knowe the same. Her doe you knowe to whome Diane her face Doth turne, and points her to vs with her hand, Who matcheth her in wisedome and in grace, And equall is with others in this land In wit, and hath in beautie highest place: Apt to conduct and leade a martiall band. T'is Lady Isabell Mauriq of Padille, Who Mars doth conquer and with wonder fill. The Ladies Mary Manuell and Ione Osorius, are those two, which you doe see, Whose grace, and beautie, as the like not knowne, Euen Loue himselfe with loue doth wound and slee. And this our Goddesse doth not ioy alone, To see two such with her, but also wee. Since then no toong their worthinesse may praise, Reason, and fame to heauen the same shall raise. And those two sisters of such worthy name, Either of them a second neuer had. Their grace, and beautie fils the world with fame: This day their golden beames doth each one glad: Me thinkes I see them in their perfect frame, To which more beautie nature could not adde. The Lady Bettrice Sarmient is one, With Castro her faire sister so well knowne. That cleerest sunne, which heere you see doth shine, And heere and there her golden beames doth cast, She, that doth laugh at louers that doe pine In loue, and at the teares, that they doe wast, And at Loues powre: whose countenance diuine Saies more then I, though praising her so fast, T'is Lady Iane Carate, in whom we see Surpassing grace and beauties praise to bee. The Lady Anne Osorius, that braue dame, And Castro next to her possesse their place, For peerelesse beautie honoured with fame, For goodly giftes, for modestie, and grace: But her hard hap (alas) was much to blame, So cruelly her glory to deface: Bicause her fortune equall might not bee Vnto her wisedome, beautie, and degree. That matchlesse beautie that's adorned so With honestie, and grace so soueraine, Which was with reason chosen to bestowe Her honour in the Temple of Diana, Not conquer'd, but still conqu'ring high and lowe: Her name (O Nymphes) is Lady Iuliana, Neece to that greatest Duke and Conestable, Speake fame of her, for I am far vnable. Behold the beautie (on the other part) Of many faire and braue Valencian Dames, Whom with my pen, but more yet with my hart, I will procure to celebrate their names? Heere Fount of Helicone, vouchsafe thy art, And heere Minerua helpe me in these blames; To tell what those braue Ladies be, whose sight Onely to them all eies and harts inuite. See heere fowre blasing stars that brightly shine, Of whom Fame brutes their name in euery ground, That from three famous kingdomes drawe their line, And from Cardonas ancient house come downe, On th' one side Dukes most excellent decline, And from the other scepter, throne, and crowne: Daughters vnto Sogorbe, whose golden fame From Atlas vnto Maurus soundes their name. The light of all the world, the flowre of Spaine, The end of perfect beautie, and of grace, A royall hart, that euer doth maintaine Valour, and bountie, in a vertuous race: That looke so modest, and so sweete againe, Adorned with so faire and milde a face, Giues Lady Anne of Aragon such fame, That Loue himselfe is captiue to her name. Her sister Lady Bettrice, that you see, Is next (if that you can behold such light) Whom none can praise, for this is onely shee, Whom none can praise according to her right: That Painter that did make her, so must bee Her praiser, and her giftes he must recite: For where all humane wit cannot attaine, My poore conceite doth labour there in vaine. The Lady Frances of great Aragon Shew you I vvould, but she is alvvaies hid: Her svveetest beauties leaues not any one With life, for so her starlike eies forbid Our mortall sight to vievv the same alone: In life and death, her vertues euer did Subiect each hart to loue, and admiration: As fame can tell in euery forrain nation. Now Lady Magdalene you may reueale, Sister vnto those three which I haue showne, Behold her well, and see how she doth steale Her gazers harts, and subiect liues to none. Her peerelesse beautie threats, and in a chaine Leades little Cupid, turn'd into a stone: None see her, but they die, and none there ar But she doth conquer without armes or war. Those two bright stars, that heere and there doe vaunt Their shining beames, that dim the starrie skie, And making that illustrous house of Gaunt In all the world with high renowne to flie. This day their wisedome, and their beauties daunt Each humane thought, and euery mortall eie. For who sees Magdeline and Marguerite, That doth not die (for loue) at such a sight? But will you see the thing, that hath vndone All wits, and made them all to wonder so? Behold a Nymph more faire then orient sunne, Or louely rose, or lilly hard by Po; This Phœnix name, that through the world doth runne, Is Lady Caterine Milane, for so Valencia cals her, and the world doth say, She is as faire, and wise, as liues this day. Lift vp your eies (faire Nymphes) and now behold The Lady Mary Pexon çannoguere, How by the riuer banks her locks of gold She kembes, adorning of her shining heare, Whose beautie, wisedome, and braue giftes are told For rarest in our Europe euery wheare. Behold her eies, her faire and Cristalline face, Her sweete demeanour and her heauenly grace. Those two behold, the rest that doe excell In perfect wisedome, and in quicke conceate: And for braue beautie beare away the bell, A paire sans peere, whose starlike eies doe threate Despaire and death, to those that view them well: For there sits Cupid in his proper seate. Their blessed names doe with their nature fit, Faire Bettrice Vique and Bettrice Fenollit. What time Diana went to sport and play, With her most soueraine face, and more diuine, A morning star arose in moneth of May, Like to that Star, that neere the Moone doth shine: Which when she sawe so glorious euery way, A famous place to her she did assigne: Her beauties tell you, if her name you seeke, That she's the peerelesse Lady Anna Vigue. Faire Nymphes, behold the Lady Theodore Carroz, that is great Lady and the Queene Of such braue beautie, neuer seene before, Wisedome, and grace, as like was neuer seene: Each thing of hers enamours more and more. The brauest mens deserts haue neuer beene Such, as they durst attempt, or euer sought, By them to place in her an amorous thought. See (Shepherdes) Lady Angelas braue grace, Of Borja, looking on Diana bright; And how to her the Goddesse turnes her face, To view those eies, that all eies doe inuite, And mightie Loue himselfe weeping apace, And how the Nymph derides his conquer'd might: And laughes to see the cruell Tyrant lying, Wrapped in chaines, to her for mercy crying. Of that most famous stocke of çannoguere A flowre sprung out, so perfect and so pure, That liuing yet but yong, she neede not feare Any that may her beauties blaze obscure: Her mothers heire she is, for she doth beare The praise, which she did with her giftes procure. So hath Lady Hieronyma, you see, In grace, and wit obtain'd the high'st degree. Now in a wonder (Nimphes) will you remaine? And see what fortune gaue to her alone, How wisedome, beautie, and the goodly traine Of vertues, make in her the chiefest throne? Lady Veronica Marrades see againe, For onely by her figure it is knowne That she hath all, and nothing wants to serue her, Vnlesse it be, that none can well deserue her. The Lady Luise Penaroje we see In more then humane beautie and in grace, In euery thing most excellent is shee; All beauties els she staines, and gaines apace. Loue dies for her, and he will not agree, That any should behold so sweete a face: Who sees it dies, vnlesse he see it againe, And seene it, then his sight augments his paine. Now see I (Nymphes) that you are seeing her, On whom my thoughts continually deuise; And yours perforce from her can neuer stirre, Cupid she robs, and in her loue he dies: See how her beauties make the world to erre? See, but beware such light blinde not your eies. The Lady Iane Cardona, that faire star, It is to whom loues powres subiected ar. That beautie, which exceedeth humane thought, Which you doe see, if that you can behold it, She, whose estate was blest, esteeming nought Of fortune, time, or chaunce, that could enfold it. She, to the world that such rare giftes hath brought: She, that's my Muse, and Parnasus, vntold yet, Lady Ione Anne of Catalane, The end She is of all, that e're I did commend. Neere vnto her there is a great extreme In purest vertue, high and sublimate, In comely grace, the fairest in this Realme, Her golden haire, her necke most delicate; Each gracious eie a firie pointed beame, A noble wit, and name of heauens estate: The Lady Angela Fernando named: Whom nature to her name like gifts hath framed. Next to her sits the Lady Marian, Who hath not in the world her paragon, Neere to her sister, fairer then the swan In cristall streames, or fine Vermillion. Proud is our age of both of them, that can In tender yeeres haue no comparison For wisedome; for so much they may presume, As thousand toongs can tell, or golden plume. The two fine sisters Borjas which you see, Hyppolita and Isabell so faire, With grace and giftes, that so adorned bee, That Phebus brightest beames they doe impaire. And see how many liues that once were free, Their beauties conquers (Cupids onely snare) Behold their haire, their countenance, and eies, This gold, that sweete, and those like stars in skies. Behold the Lady Mary Cannoguere, Who now is Lady of faire Catarasse, Whose beautie, and sweete grace doth euery where Conquer each hart with vnrepaired losse: Fame on her wings th'row-out the world doth beare Her vertues rare, that shine like gold to drosse. Since each one them that sees her, must commend her, Who then can praise her well, and not offend her? The Lady Isabell Borja here doth stand Perfect and absolute in euery thing: Behold her face, her fine and dainty hand, Ouer whose head the nightingales doe sing. Our age she honours, and th' Hiberian land: Of grace, and vertue she's the onely spring: And those, to whom nature did beautie giue, She staines, as fairest that did euer liue. She, that her haire hath hanging downe, and spred Abroad, and tide with golden thred behinde: And that faire face, that hath so often led So many harts to bondage of the minde: Her Iuorie necke, her eies in beautie bred, Faire, modest, gray, not looking out of kinde: Her famous name is Lady Iuliana, That honours heere the Temple of Diana. She, whom you there doe see, whom nature made So curiously, as neuer like before, Since that her beautie neuer seem'd to fade, Nor that a faire one can desire more: Whose great deserts, and wit, doth still perswade Fame, to the world her praises to restore: Is called Lady Mencia Fenollit, To whom Loue yeelds himselfe and doth submit. [Heere Lady Katherine entombed lies] Heere Lady Katherine entombed lies, Of Aragon and Sarmient, whose fame Doth mount with praise vnto the loftie skies: And sounds from North to South, her woorthy name. Death kil'd her, to reuenge the sacrifice Of those she killed, when she was a dame: Her body's heere, her soule in heauen with pleasure: The world vnwoorthy to possesse such treasure. [Even as (O death) the Planets should remaine] Even as (O death) the Planets should remaine Without Apollo and Diana bright, The ground without mankinde, and beasts againe, The Marriner without the North-starre light; The fielde without faire flowers grasse, or graine, The mornings showe without the dewe of night: Vertue and beautie so remaine and die Without the dame that in this tombe doth lie. [First in Granada I vvas borne] First in Granada I vvas borne, In Cartama brought vp and bred, To Allora fronter, which I scorne, And in Coyn enamoured. Though in Granada I was borne, And brought vp in Cartama braue; My faith in Coyn I haue sworne, And there my libertie I gaue. There doe I liue, where I doe die, And where my care is thither led To Allora Fronter am I, And in Coyn enamoured. [If thy soft Haires be threds of shining gold] If thy soft Haires be threds of shining gold, Vnder the shade of which are two faire Eies, (Two sunnes) whose Brow like heauen doth them vphold, Rubie thy Mouth, and lips where Corall lies? Could Cristall want, to frame thy Necke so white, And Diamond, to make thy Brest so bright? Thy hart is not vnlike vnto thy Brest, Since that the flight of mettall of thy Haire Did neuer make thee turne thy Necke at lest, Nor with thine Eies giue hope, but cold despaire. Yet from that sugred Mouth hope for an I, And from that snowe-white Brow, that makes me die. Ah beautifull, and yet most bitter Brow, And may there be a Brest so hard and faire, So sweete a necke, and yet so stiffe to bow, So rich, and yet so couetous a Haire? Who euer sawe so cleere and cruell Eies, So sweete a Mouth, yet mooues not to my cries. Enuious Loue my Necke doth chaine with spite, His passions make my Brow looke pale and swart, He makes mine Eies to leese their deerest light, And in my Brest doth kill my trembling hart. He makes my Haire to standing ghastly wise, Yet in thy Mouth all wordes of comfort dies. O sweetest face, and lips more perfect faire, Then I may tell; O soft and daintie Necke, O golden Raies of yonder Sunne, not Haire, O Cristalline Brow, and Mouth with Rubie deckt, O equall white and red, O Diamond Brest, From these faire Eies when shall I hope for rest? But if a (No) by turning of thine Eies, Harke yet what saith her sweetest Mouth to me? See if her hardnes in her Brest yet lies, And if she turnes her whitest Necke to thee? Marke vvell the beckning of her fairest Brow, Then from her Haire what may I hope for now? If that her Lilly Brest and Necke doe once affirme their (No) And if her shining Eies and Haire will not conclude an (I) What will her Ruby Mouth then doe, and Brow as white as snowe, Nay what shall I my selfe expect but vvith denials die? The end of the fourth booke. The fifth Booke of Diana of George of Montemayor. [O vainest hopes, Alas, how many Daies] O vainest hopes, Alas, how many Daies Haue I beene bondslaue to a braue Deceite? And how, in vaine, haue these two wearied Eies With show'rs of teares watred this pleasant Vale? Appaid I am of cruell Loue, and Fortune, And knowe not yet whereof I doe Complaine. No small harmes I must passe, since I Complaine, For, to endure, framed are all my Daies, The traunces, and deceites of Loue and Fortune: But whence Complaine I, of a braue Deceite, Of such a Shepherdesse within this Vale, On whom (to my great harme) I cast mine Eies? Yet am I much beholding to my Eies, (Although with greefe of them I doe Complaine) Since by their meanes I sawe within this Vale The fairest thing, which neuer in my Daies I thought to see, And this is no Deceite; In proofe whereof, aske it of Loue and Fortune. Though on the other side, in stable Fortune, And time, occasion, and my dolefull Eies, And not suspecting this most braue Deceite, Caus'd all the ill, whereof I doe Complaine: And so I thinke to end my wofull Daies, Counting my greefes, and passions to this Vale. If that the riuer, hill, the meade, and Vale. Earth, heauen, and fate, and cruell Loue, and Fortune, The howers, and the moments, yeeres, and Daies, My soule, my hart, and these two wearied Eies, Doe aggrauate my greefe when I Complaine, Who then can say, I liue by fond Deceite? Deceiu'd I was, but this was no Deceite, For, that I haue beheld within this Vale So rare perfection, I doe not Complaine, But to behold, how Loue and cruell Fortune Would signifie vnto these wearied Eies, That there should come a helpe after some Daies. And now the yeeres are past, the months, and Daies, Vpon this confidence, and cleere Deceite: Wearie with weeping are my watrie Eies: Wearie to heare me is the hill, and Vale. And in the end thus answered of false Fortune, Iesting at that, whereof I doe Complaine. But wofull man, whereof doe I Complaine, But of the length of my prolonged Daies? Perhaps, a slaue to me is cruell Fortune, That for my fault she must pay this Deceite? Went he not free, exempted in this Vale, Who did command me to lift vp mine Eies? But who againe can tame his greedie Eies, Or can I liue, if I doe not Complaine Of th' ill, which Loue hath done me in this Vale. Curst be that ill, that lastes so many Daies: But death cannot (if this be no Deceite) Stay long to giue an end vnto my Fortune. Calmes wonted are to come after hard Fortune, But neuer shall be viewed of mine Eies. (Nor yet I thinke to fall in this Deceite) O well, let the first suffice, which I Complaine, And will (faire Shepherdesse) as many Daies, As the remembrance lasteth of this Vale. If (Shepherdesse) that day, when in this Vale I did behold thee (to my hardest Fortune The finall end had come of all my Daies, Or I had lesse beheld those coyest Eies, The cause should cease, whereof I doe Complaine, And I would fall no more into Deceite. But purposing to worke me this Deceite, When by and by thou sawest me in this Vale, Milde thou didst seeme: See then if I Complaine Vniustly of false Loue, and cruell Fortune? And now I knowe not, why thou turn'st thine Eies Away, vnlesse thou greeuest at my Daies. My song of Loue and Fortune I Complaine, And since a braue Deceite so many Daies Did last, water mine Eies this hill and Vale. [When that I poore soule was borne] When that I poore soule was borne, I was borne vnfortunate: Presently the Fates had sworne To foretell my haplesse state. Titan his faire beames did hide, Phœbe 'clips'd her siluer light, In my birth my mother dide, Yong, and faire in heauie plight. And the nurse, that gaue me sucke, Haplesse was in all her life: And I neuer had good lucke Being maide or married wife. I lou'd well, and was belou'd, And forgetting, was forgot: This a haplesse marriage mou'd, Greeuing that it kils me not. With the earth would I were wed, Then in such a graue of woes Daily to be buried, Which no end nor number knowes. Yong my father married me, Forc't by my obedience: Syrenus, thy faith, and thee I forgot, without offence. Which contempt I pay so far, Neuer like was paide so much: Iealousies doe make me war, But without a cause of such. I doe goe with iealous eies To my foldes, and to my sheepe, And with iealousie I rise, When the day begins to peepe. At his table I doe eate, In his bed with him I lie, But I take no rest, nor meate, Without cruell iealousie. If I aske him what he ailes, And whereof he iealous is? In his answere then he failes: Nothing can he say to this. In his face there is no cheere, But he euer hangs the head: In each corner he doth peere, And his speech is sad and dead. Ill the poore soule liues ywisse, That so hardly married his. [Now Loue, and fortune turne to me againe] Now Loue, and fortune turne to me againe, And now each one enforceth and assures A hope, that was dismaied, dead, and vaine: And from the harbour of mishaps recures A hart, that is consum'd in burning fire, With vnexpected gladnes, that adiures My soule to lay aside her mourning tire, And senses to prepare a place for ioy. Care in obliuion endlesse shall expire: For euery greefe of that extreme annoy, Which when my torment raign'd, my soule (alas) Did feele, the which long absence did destroy, Fortune so well appaies, that neuer was So great the torment of my passed ill, As is the ioy of this same good I passe. Returne my hart, sur saulted with the fill Of thousand great vnrests, and thousand feares: Enioy thy good estate, if that thou will: And wearied eies, leaue of your burning teares, For soone you shall behold her with delight, For whom my spoiles with glorie Cupid beares. Senses which seeke my star so cleere and bright, By making heere and there your thoughts estray, Tell me, what will you feele before her sight? Hence solitarinesse, torments away Felt for her sake, and wearied members cast Of all your paine, redeem'd this happy day. O stay not time but passe with speedie hast, And Fortune hinder not her comming now. O God, betides me yet this greefe at last? Come my sweete Shepherdesse, the life which thou (Perhaps) didst thinke was ended long ago, At thy commaund is ready still to bow. Comes not my Shepherdesse desired so? O God what if she's lost, or if she stray Within this wood, where trees so thicke doe growe? Or if this Nymph, that lately went away, Perhaps forgot to go and seeke her out. No, no, in her obliuion neuer lay. Thou onely art my Shepherdesse about Whose thoughts my soule shall finde her ioy and rest: Why comm'st not then to assure it from doubt? O see'st thou not the sunne passe to the vvest, And if it passe, and I behold thee not, Then I my vvonted torments vvill request And thou shalt vvaile my hard and heauie lot. The Glosse. The Shepherd begins afresh to sing upon this old proverb. Good fortune come and tarie. The glosse he descants upon it to his owne purpose. What motions, times and changes, What waies, what vncouth ranges, What slights, what disillusions, What gladnes (in conclusions) Haue risen of such sorrowes? One faith yet all these borrowes, And one good loue assureth, And my misfortunes cureth. And since from greefe they varie, Good fortune come and tarie. Good hap thou still dost mooue thee, So light as not behooues thee, And if, thus to content me, Thou thinkest to repent thee? Then better is my smarting: For if thou goest, At parting My sense and wits forsake me: But if (more sure to make me) Thou com'st, my soule to marrie, Good fortune come and tarrie. But if I come in vaine heere, Or liue deceiu'd, to plaine heere: For, wretched men what feare not? To loose my life, then weare not The same more safe each hower? O feare, strange is thy power. For th' ill thou figurest euer. But since such beautie neuer Did any falshood carrie, Good fortune come and tarrie. The end of the fifth booke. The sixth Booke of Diana of George of Montemayor. [I see thee iolly Shepherd merry] I see thee iolly Shepherd merry, And firme thy faith and sound as a berry. Loue gaue me ioy, and fortune gaue it, As my desire could wish to haue it. What didst thou wish, tell me (sweete louer) Whereby thou might'st such ioy recouer? To loue where loue should be inspired, Since there's no more to be desired. In this great glory, and great gladnes, Think'st thou to haue no touch of sadnes? Good fortune gaue me not such glory, To mocke my loue, or make me sorie. If my firme loue I were denying, Tell me, with sighes would'st thou be dying? Those wordes in iest to heare thee speaking, For very greefe my hart is breaking. Yet would'st thou change, I pray thee tell me, In seeing one, that did excell me? O noe, for how can I aspire, To more then to mine owne desire. Such great affection dost thou beare me As by thy wordes thou seem'st to sweare me? Of thy deserts, to which a detter I am, thou maist demaund this better. Sometimes me thinkes, that I should sweare it, Sometimes me thinkes, thou should'st not beare it. Onely in this, my hap doth greeue me, And my desire, not to beleeue me. Imagine that thou dost not loue mine, But some braue beautie that's aboue mine. To such a thing (sweete) doe not will me, Where faining of the same doth kill me. I see thy firmnes gentle louer, More then my beautie can discouer. And my good fortune to be higher Then my desert, but not desier. [Passed contents] Passed contents, O what meane ye? Forsake me now, and doe not wearie me. Wilt thou heare me, O memorie, My pleasant daies, and nights againe, I haue appaid with seuenfold paine: Thou hast no more to aske me why, For when I went, they all did die: As thou dost see, O leaue me then, and doe not wearie me. Greene field, and shadowed valley, wheare Sometime my chiefest pleasure was, Behold what I did after passe: Then let me rest, and if I beare Not with good cause continuall feare, Now doe you see. O leaue me then, and doe not trouble me. I sawe a hart changed of late, And wearied to assure mine: Then I was forced to recure mine By good occasion, time and fate, My thoughts that now such passions hate, O what meane ye? Forsake me now and doe not wearie me. You lambes and sheepe that in these layes, Did sometimes follow me so glad: The merry howres, and the sad Are passed now with all those daies: Make not such mirth, and wonted plaies, As once did ye: For now no more you haue deceiued me. If that to trouble me you come, Or come to comfort me indeede: I haue no ill for comforts neede. But if to kill me, Then (in summe) Full well may ye Kill me, and you shall make an end of me. [If teares cannot with tendernesse relent thee] Syrenus. If teares cannot with tendernesse relent thee, How can my song thy cruelty assured, Since nought of mine could euer yet content thee: What hart was euer that so much endured? That to deride thou neuer canst suffice thee, A greefe that hath the worlds wonder procured. Ah blinde conceite, let loue nor time disguise thee, And such a thought of change that neuer told me But to thy good and my content aduise thee. Ah wilt thou in such cares and greefes enfold me, Fierce Shepherdesse, and in such lamentations To spend my dolefull yeeres, wilt thou behold mo? A hart that's thine, dispos'st thou in such fashions? Intreat'st thou thus a soule to thee affied, That the lest greefe it is to suffer passions? Syluanus. Loue such a knot, that's endles thou hast tied, That's blinde, and thou, and I more blinde intended: And she is blinde, for whom my life's denied: For I sawe not my life, and pleasure ended, Nor she how I for her to death imploy me, Nor thou, that I in flames am thus incended. Fell Loue, shall faire Diana now destroy me With absence? then conclude (since hate surrounds it) To end my life, and fortunes that annoy me. Ioy's slowe, time flies, and with his shortnes wounds it, Hope dies, an amorous thought liues still augmented: Loue shortens it, prolongs it, and confounds it. To speake I am ashamed thus tormented, And though it greeues me, yet with ceaslesse payning Without the same I cannot liue contented. Syrenus. O soule, forsake not now thy dolefull plaining, And you my wearied eies Cease not in swelling teares my cheekes to steepe, Since you haue learn'd to weepe, And waile the chiefest cause of all my cries. Syluanus. And waile the chiefest cause of all my cries: Yet (cruell Shepherdesse) Sometimes they were of my most sweete content. O thoughts in sorrow spent, How small time lasts a ioy and happines? Syrenus. How small time lasts a ioy and happines, And that sweete gracious smile, (Fortune) wherewith I sawe thee not accoyd? Now all is well imployd In him, whom time doth counsell and beguile. Syluanus. In him, whom time doth counsell and beguile, Loue works his behest:The pagination of the source document has been followed. But in his things who can him well aduise? Or his deceites who spies? O cruell Shepherdesse, O cruell brest. Syrenus. O cruell Shepherdesse, O cruell brest Whose crueltie is no Whit lesse then her braue beautie and her grace, And my mishap and case: How to my cost my sorrowes doe I knowe? Syluanus. My Shepherdesse, in white and red more cleere, Then both those roses pluckt, in May we see: And brighter then the sunne beames sent From their coruscant Orient By morning, that vpon thy foldes appeere: How can I liue, if thou forgettest me? My Shepherdesse, thy rigour then impaire, For crueltie becomes not one so faire. Syrenus. My faire Diana more resplendant, then The Emerauld, or Diamond in the night: Whose beautious eies doe cease My sorrowes, that increase, If gently that (perhaps) to me they bend. So maist thou with thy flocke so faire and vvhite, Come to my shadovved sheepefold in the heate, That such a vvretch thou vvould'st not ill intreate. Syluanus. My Shepherdesse, when that thy yellow haire Thou combest in the beames of shining sunne, Dost thou not see the same obscured? My pride and ioy by them procured? That am from hence beholding it so faire, Woon now with hope, now with despaire vndone, But so maist thou thy beautie braue enioy, As thou wouldst giue, a meane in such annoy. Syrenus. Diana, whose sweete name in all these hils The wilde beastes tames, and crueltie rebates: And whose surpassing beautie to it Doth subiect fortune, and vndoe it. And feares not loue, but wars against his wils: Respecting not occasion, time, nor fates. To thee thy flockes and folds such ioy may giue, As carelesse of my greefe thou wouldst not liue. Syluanus. The heate is past (Syrenus) and doth cease, The Shepherds to their folds begin to goe, And wearie grashoppers doe hold their peace: The night will not stay long, which, hid belovve, Is comming in, vvhile Phœbus in our skie Doth heere and there his vading light be stovve: Therefore before the darkest shade shall lie Vpon the ground, and vvhile the vvren doth sing In top of this greene Sicamour on hie, Our vvandring flockes together let vs bring, And driue them vvhere Diana novv doth stay For vs, vvhile in the vvoods our voices ring. Syrenus. My friend, Syluanus, goe not yet avvay, Since all his beames not yet the sunne doth hide, And that vve haue sufficient of the day. There's time for vs and for our flocke beside, And time to driue them to the riuer cleere. For in this meade to day they shall abide: And, Shepherd, let my song be ended heere. The end of the sixth booke. The seuenth Booke of Diana of George of Montemayor. [Times change and shall (as we doe see)] Times change and shall (as we doe see) And life shall haue an ende: But yet my faith shall euer bee Whereon my eies depende. The daies, and moments, and their scope, The howres with their changes wrought, Are cruell enemies to hope, And friendes vnto a louing thought. Thoughts still remaine, as we doe see, And hope shall haue an end; But yet my faith shall not leaue me, Her honour to defend. Inconstancie in trust contriued, Causeth great danger in conclusion, And life that is of hope depriued, Standes not in feare of disillusion. Times goe and come, as we doe see, And life shall haue an end, But yet my faith shall neuer bee Distan'd for foe or friend. [Sighes, since you lighten not my hart] Sighes, since you lighten not my hart, Why go you not, why stay you still? For in the end hope doth impart A remedie vnto mine ill. Yet hope to helpe me neuer stood, Where reason worketh all in vaine: Nor euer promis'd so much good, As crueltie doth giue me paine. But loue and trust giue me an art, And qualitie of such a skill, That neither hope reuiues my hart, Nor crueltie the same doth kill. Mine eies you neede not then complaine, With which her faire ones I haue seene, And what neede you to feare againe, Since viewed by her you haue beene? And therefore change shall haue no part, Nor entrance in my constant will, Though crueltie doth kill my hart, Or whether hope remaineth still. The end of the seauen Bookes of Diana of George of Montemayor. THE FIRST BOOKE OF THE SECOND PART OF Diana OF George of Montemayor. [Who hath of Cupids cates and dainties prayed] Syrenus. Who hath of Cupids cates and dainties prayed, May feede his stomacke with them at his pleasure: If in his drinke some ease he hath essaied, Then let him quench his thirsting without measure: And if his weapons pleasant in their manner, Let him imbrace his standard and his banner. For being free from him, and quite exempted, Ioyfull I am, and proud, and well contented. Syluanus. Of Cupids daintie cates who hath not prayed, May be depriued of them at his pleasure: If wormewood in his drinke he hath essaied, Let him not quench his thirsting without measure: And if his weapons cruell in their manner, Let him abiure his standard and his banner: For I not free from him, and not exempted, Ioyfull I am, and proud, and well contented. Syrenus. Loue's so expert in giuing many a trouble, That now I knowe not, why he should be praised: He is so false, so changing, and so double, That with great reason he must be dispraised: Loue (in the end) is such a iarring passion, That none should trust vnto his peeuish fashion: For of all mischiefe he's the onely Master, And to my good a torment and disaster. Syluanus. Loue's so expert in giuing ioy, not trouble, That now I knowe not, but he should be praised: He is so true, so constant, neuer double, That in my minde he should not be dispraised: Loue (in the end) is such a pleassing passion, That euery one may trust vnto his fashion: For of all good he is the onely Master, And foe vnto my harmes, and my disaster. Syrenus. Not in these sayings to be proou'd a lier, He knowes, that doth not loue, nor is beloued: Now nights and daies I rest, as I desier, After I had sush greefe from me remoued: And cannot I be glad, since thus estranged, My selfe from false Diana I haue changed? Hence, hence false Loue I will not entertaine thee, Since to thy torments thou dost seeke to traine me. Syluanus. Not in these sayings to be proou'd a lier, He knowes, that loues, and is againe beloued: Now nights an daies I rest in sweete desier, After I had such happy fortune proued: And cannot I be glad, since not estranged, My selfe into Seluagia I haue changed? Come, come good Loue, and I will entertaine thee, Since to thy sweete content thou seek'st to traine mee. A Sonnet. [From whence O Paper mine such happie fauour] From whence O Paper mine such happie fauour, That vndeseruedly thou must be placed Before that flowre that yeeldes the sweetest sauour, Which nature hath with all her powres graced? Thou shalt the figure see (my louing Paper) Where all the vertues make their wished dwelling, And of the rest not any one escape her, Graces, and giftes, and beauties most excelling. Then when thou com'st before my heauenly treasure, Say thus from me to her. He sends me hither, Who liues to serue thee, whilst his life extendeth: In onely this his thoughts are musing euer: In ioy of this both nights and daies he spendeth: To serue thee is his onely sport and pleasure. [Poore I that am not now for thee] Poore I that am not now for thee (If any health I haue to lend) To thee, that hast each part of me All that I haue, I meane to send. Receiue this letter left alone, That to conuert all his to thine, And not in any thing his owne, This onely paper is behinde. Since I haue giu'n thee all the rest, Thine honour it shall not gainstand, To take a thing, that is in the lest: A peece of paper at my hand. So poore and base a thing as this, Cannot offend thy minde so high: Why then, it cannot be amisse, To take and reade it by and by. But in the same if thou dost find Words written ill, and not well coucht, Knowe that my hand did like the winde Tremble, when that my pen it toucht. The blots, which heere thou see'st disgrace My letter, making it to blame, My teares they are, that fell apace, Knowing to thee I wrote the same. Reade it, I pray thee, to the end: And make an end of all my woes, Open thine eies to this I send, And to my griefes giue some repose. And to the end thou maist it reede, It comes not from an En'mies brest, But from a faithfull hart indeede, And from a friend aboue the rest. It is no letter, that defies (Defied for I am too much) Alas in conquer'd men it lies Not in their power to be such. In endlesse peace I seeke to liue, And on thy grace I doe relie, If not, the doome and sentence giue Vnto my life condemn'd to die. I haue contended to this howre Thy mighty forces to resist, And now I finde, thy onely powre Doth conquer (Mistresse) as thou list. It is not much, that in the field Vnto thy valour I giue place, Since that the God of loue doth yeeld Himselfe, vnto thy wounding face. So that now subiect I remaine Vnto thy sou'raine force, I see, Then wound me not, for t'is in vaine, Since wholy I doe yeeld to thee. My life I put into thy hands, And now doe with me at thy will: But yet behold, how pitie stands Entreating thee thou wouldst not kill. So shalt thou make thy conquest braue, If in thy spoiles and triumphes, such Remorse of pitie thou wilt haue, Which all the world commends so much. I sawe thee sit not long agoe Feasting with ioy and pleasant fare, And I, bicause I could not soe, Did feede vpon my woes and care. There leisurely thou didst begin Of other cates and flesh to feede, But I with haste did rauin in My pains, wherwith my hart did bleede. The Riuer water thou didst drinke With freest minde deuoid of care, But I in fluds of teares did sinke, The which to drinke I did not spare. I sawe thee with thy little knife Cutting thy bread and meate againe, And then (me thought) my wofull life Should in like sort be cut in twaine. A little Boy sat in thy lap, Thou didst imbrace him with great ioy: Oh would it had beene then my hap To haue beene that same little Boy. Thou gau'st to him a louing kisse: What heere I felt, I will repeate, Let it suffice, that I was this Most happy childe, but in conceate. But not contented vvith the same, Marking the place where thou didst lay Thy lips, vnto the childe I came, And tooke from him the kisse avvay. Each thing of thine so vvell I loue, That if I see them to decay, Me thinks' my care it doth behoue To saue, to cast them not avvay. For all the bones, which thou didst leaue, With greedy stomacke I did picke, Bicause I onely did conceaue, That they thy daintie mouth did licke. The place I marked of the pot, That did thy Corall lips diuide, When thou didst drinke and I did not Forget to drinke of that same side. And with the wine which I did shed Of purpose, on the cloth aboue: Often (in vaine) these words in red My finger wrote: I loue, I loue: (Disdainfull) thou dost not esteeme These signes, nor these inductions know, Or dost at least (as it doth seeme Dissemble: it must needes be so. And onely that thou dost dissemble, Which might vnto my profit fall, But that which makes me now to tremble, Alas, thou fainest not at all. By seeing such effects in me, That thou dost cause my heauines, Thou fain'st, my plaintes are not for thee, But for some other Shepherdesse. Thou seest how for thy loue I paine, And at thy gracious feete I lie. (To greeue me more) yet dost thou faine, That for another I doe die. But if thy beauties in great store Engender pride of such excesse, Thou must beleeue, and faine no more, That my pure loue is no whitlesse. If thy perfections doe surpasse All beauties that the world doth breede, As much as Dimond passeth glasse, So doth my loue all loues exceede. And when thou com'st to know, that none Is worthy of thy louely grace, Thou must not faine, that I am one, That may deserue so sweete a place. I am not worthy of so deere A choice (I say) to be my lot, Since all the world hath not thy peere, For that it selfe deserues thee not. And though I said so (in a vaine) I shall not be beleeu'd, I knowe; For well thou know'st what one doth faine, Is of a thing which is not soe. Dispose of me euen at thy will, And faine as much as any one, So thou beleeue, and faine not still, That I loue none, but thee alone. Then on thy gentlenes I call In pitie, which thou hast forgot, Thou would'st not mocke my loue at all, Nor faine, that I doe loue thee not. Great Ioue can witnesse heere to thee, That it doth greeue me not so much, The little loue thou bear'st to me, As once to faine, that mine is such. Nor it doth greeue me of thy guise, To see thee mocke me in such sort: Or that my things in any wise May cause thy laughter and thy sport. But it doth glad me without measure, That thou dost mocke my loue so lost, Since by such meanes I giue thee pleasure: (Although it be vnto my cost.) To make thee laugh, I doe adiure The heauens (as I thy loue may ioy) That many times I doe procure To doe, and tell thee many a toy. And though I know none will omit To call me foole (not without cause) A simple man of little wit, Sweruing too much from reasons lawes: Yet Shepherdesse it skils me not, Nor it doth not my minde dismay That all repute me for a sot, So I may please thee any way. Since that I cannot (Shepherdesse) With things in earnest please thy vaine, I will content thee (at the lest) Fr? hence with toies (though to my pain) To thee they are but things in iest (For so thou mean'st to take them all) But euer to my painfull brest True they haue proou'd, and so they shall. Mocke me thy fill, since thou dost make It all thy glee, thy sport, and laughter: But I doe wish, that Loue may take A narrow count of thee heereafter. I once did also iest with loue, Loue did I scoffe, and loue despise, But to my paine I now doe proue What did thereof to me arise. And this is that poore silly mee This wicked traitor brought vnto; But woe is me, that now with thee I knowe not what he meanes to do. With iestes and sports of thousand fashions Two thousand fauors thou didst lend me, But yet the God of loue, to passions In earnest turnes them, to offend me. With thine owne hand (O what a thing) In iesting didst thou carue to me? In iest thou saidst and sometimes sing, Mine onely Shepherd thou shalt be. O sweetest foode of sauourie tast, Of force my poore life to maintaine: Sweet words, whose sound did bind me fast, Of force to giue me rest againe. Both word, and deede, and what did passe (Though but a merry iest it were yet) So singular a grace it was, That in my brest I cannot beare it. To sickest men to giue great store Of meate, and so much as they craue, It is not good, but iust no more, Then it is meete for them to haue. Fauours I craue by heapes of thee, That thou wouldst giue me (Shepherdesse) But yet (perhaps) they may kill me, For little force I doe possesse. It hurts the driest field and meade, As much to cast in them great plentie Of water, as if they lay deade, Of water, and of moisture emptie. So fauours in the selfe same sort, If that they haue no rule, nor measure, Suffice to make ones life more short, As wel as scornes, hates, and displeasure. But in the end, and howsoeuer, Take thy full ioy, although I die. Whether it be with death for euer, Or with my life, I care not I. Mocke, and with me doe what thou list, And happen will, what happen may, My will thy will shall not resist, But thy commaund shall still obay, Commaund me then to be thy loue, Commaund me in thy loue to end, And he that rules, and is aboue All harts, commaund thy hart to bend. Since mightie Loue commaunds my hart, Of force thy louer I must bee, Ioine thou with loue, and take his part, Then all the world shall honour thee. But I haue written to be plaine Enough, since thou hast not thy fill By giuing me continuall paine, Desiring yet to serue thee still. But in the end now will I cease, Although my torment doth not end: Desire is conquerd by the feare I haue, thy patience to offend. A Sonnet. [I plaid with Loue, Loue plaid with me againe] I plaid with Loue, Loue plaid with me againe, I mocked him, but I was mockt in deede, He would not let my hart his art exceede: For (though a Boy) yet mocks he doth disdaine. A friend he is to those, that doe not faine: My iestes (it seemes) doe true affection breede: And now, if Loue is not reuenged with speede, My hart can witnes that with earnest paine. Goe louers then to iest it out apace With this God Cupid but a boy, and blinde, And you shall see, if it be good or noe? Thinking to haue delight, you shall haue woe, Seeking cold water, fire you shall finde, Who plaies with boies, comes often to disgrace. [It may fall out the heauens may turne at leisure] Syluanus. It may fall out the heauens may turne at leisure, And stay themselues vpon the highest mountaines: And Ezla, and Mondego, at their pleasure. With hastie course turne backe vnto their fountaines: And that the flaxe, or reede, laid to the fire, May not consume in flames, but burne like wire: But yet the day and time shall happen neuer, When Syluan shall not loue Seluagia euer. Seluagia. The ground shall first be void, nor trod, nor vsed, Leesing her nature, and her proper being: First shall the raine, and vvater be refused Of plants, no moisture round about them seeing: First shall our life vvith aire be not sustained, And first the foode of hunger be disdained: Before the vvorld shall see a deede so hainous, Seluagia not to loue her deere Syluanus. Syluanus. The presence of the vvoolfe, that doth deuoure The sillie lambes, in shades shall not be feared: As little shall the hare, vvithin her bovvre The yalping hounds, nor harts of lions teared; Nor Mouse of Cat, All hate shall be extruded, And louing peace tvvixt all shall be concluded: But yet the time and day shall happen neuer When Syluan shall not loue Seluagia euer. Seluagia. The flocke of little chickes (the dams deere treasure) Of rauening kites and gleades shall be eschevved: The Partridge shall securely liue in pleasure, Of praying Goshauke being not pursued: The pullaine shall not be of Foxe molested, But peace, and truce tvvixt all shall be suggested: But neuer lies a deede in her so hainous, As that Seluagia should forget Syluanus. Syluanus. I say, vvhile any part shall be maintained Of thy Syluanus vvith blood and vitall povvres, And vvhilst each member of the same sustained Shall be vvith soule, vnto their latest hovvres; And if (besides) the soule can loue (expired) When to the graue the body is retired, In life, in death, else let him prosper neuer: Syluan's shall loue his Shepherdesse for euer. Seluagia. I say, vvhile liuing breath shall not be vvanting In thy Seluagia, louing thee so truly: And vvhile her soule, vvithin her body panting, Shall make aboade, and gouerne it so duly: And aftervvardes, if that (the same deceased) Body and soule may be in loue increased, In life, and death, and after death so hainous, Seluagia shall for euer loue Syluanus. [The Gods graunt you to frolicke in your hall] The Gods graunt you to frolicke in your hall, His yeeres, that so long time vvith nature striue, And that in happie fortune you may liue, Free from all kinde of sorrovves great or small: And in your loue one haire may neuer fall Of iealousie, a plague eid like a sieue. Let heauens to temporall goodes their fauours giue. Fire, aire, sea, earth, and nature at your call. The rot may neuer touch your soundest stockes, Feare of the vvoolfe your shades may not molest: And vvily foxe not feare your pretie lambes. In plenty may encrease your goodly stockes, Tvvo kids may yeerely yeane your fruitfull dams, And your faire Evves vvith double tvvinlings blest. [Faire Shepherdesse Diana] Faire Shepherdesse Diana, Where dost thou now thy figure hide, More bright then cleere Diana, When to her full course she is hide. Venus, the Goddesse faire, Of beauties all the soueraine, Wonders at this affaire, That now her beauties doe not raine. A sunnie beame thou art, And who beholdes thy heauenly dies, Thou wound'st with natures art, And wounded, in his passions dies. Thou art a Dimond well, From whence sweete liquor floweth fast, Ambrosium thou art well, From which mine eies shall neuer fast. Each thing in thee thou hast To make thee perfect in each part, If now thou would'st but haste To pitie, not my soule to part. This wager will I beare, And lay, Thou wantest not an ounce, More cruell then a Beare To be, or Tygre, or an Ounce. Cruell thou art in praying, For thee I burne, as flames in Kill, Those that to thee are praying For mercie, thou dost scorne and kill. My soule thine absence teares, And giues vnto the same againe Torments, my torments teares, (Teares that doe make so small a gaine.) More bitter then the gall, Thy absence is, or Sallow wan, With sorrow it doth gall My hart, and makes me pale and wan. In beautie not a peere Thou hast, for it exceedes the rest, But where it doth appeere, Thy crueltie there giues no rest. O what a foole am I To wish to see her in this plaine, That from her mouth an (I) Will not afford, but (No) so plaine. No paine I doe deserue For words, hauing worse deeds essai'd For whom Loue thus doth serue, It is not much this to haue said. If that thou mean'st to seale Thy crueltie in deedes to leaue, How can I then conceale The same in song among these leaues? Faire Shepherdesse, who bad Thee flie from me? If thou dost waigh, So base a thing, and bad, Deserues not glory any way. [The fearefull Bat that lurks in stonie wall] The fearefull Bat that lurks in stonie wall, Flies heere and there assured of her sight, When that she sees the signes of darksome night Approching on, contented therewithall; But when she spies the sunnie beames so bright, Her fault she doth acknowledge and recall. So novv of late to me it did befall: For I did thinke there vvas no other light Nor beautie then in her, vvho did inuite My senses first to loue: but (to my thrall) When I beheld Diana so bedight With beauties, and such grace Angelicall, Then by and by I knevv that heeretofore I plainly err'd: but neuer could doe more. [The open fieldes, the meadovves fresh and greene] The open fieldes, the meadovves fresh and greene Their colour and their signe of hope had lost, Hauing not Syluan, and Seluagia seene, With vvhose svveete presence they did alvvaies bost. The goodly vales and hils vvere hard and dried, Without the steps, that novv doth make them glad, Shepherds and sheepe in melancholie died, Depriued of their songs, that once they had. Now all with pride will shew their ioies againe, All will reioice, as once they did before: The hill, the vale, the field, the meade, and plaine, For merry spring and sommer they restore: Welcome Seluagia then, your ioyfull spring, And her Syluanus, that doth sommer bring. [In this greene Meade mine Eies what doe you see] In this greene Meade mine Eies what doe you see, The Bagpipe of my Nymph so passing faire? Vnlesse my senses Dreame, so should it be, For Sure this is the Oke, wherewith despaire She lean'd vnto, and heere the grasse yet lies, And field, that she did water with her eies. What doubt I then? mine Eies see it so plaine: For Sure I knowe, this is the very Meade, And tree that did her tender lims sustaine: This is the Bagpipe, which my Nymph did treade Vpon: This is the Oke, the happy beame, Whereto she lean'd, I knowe this is no Dreame. But if I Dreame, that thinking with mine Eies All this I see, and all doth prooue but nought: And if this Oke in dreame I doe surmise, And see this Meade, but onely in my thought, Where my faire Nymph did print her goodly feete: O Sure it were a dreame to me most sweete. Ioue thee I pray, if this I doe but feare, And if my Dreame doth fall out Sure or no? By all the loue to Nymphes, that thou didst beare, Open mine Eies the trueth that I may knowe: Helpe me to pray him greene and flowrie Meade, Helpe me to pray him, Oke with branchie heade. What hath deseru'd this faire and stately Oke, Why that should not be Sure, which I doe see? What hainous fault could this fine Meade prouoke, Why things in deede should seeme but Dreames to mee? Vnto mine Eies what is befallen of late, Why that they should not see my Nymphes estate? This Bagpipe of my Nymph I will deuise, To hang it heere (faire Oke) to honour thee: A woorthy Trophee, though before mine Eies Lying disgrac't for teares they cannot see, If it be Sure, or if I dreame in vaine, (Spoil'd in this Meade with parching sunne and raine) That gracious Nymph that gaue my hart the stroke In this greene Meade, I sawe (a heauenly prize) And (if I dreame not) leaning to that Oke; Nay, Sure, I did behold her with mine Eies: O that she had but seene me then againe, Or that I had but seene or dream'd in vaine. [I am Dianes, th' Arabian bird in beautie and in grace] I am Dianes, th' Arabian bird in beautie and in grace, Let no man therefore once preseume to take me from this place. [Shepherds giue eare and now be still] Shepherds giue eare and now be still Vnto my passions, and their cause, And what they be? Since that with such an earnest will, And such great signes of friendships lawes You aske it me. It is not long, since I was whole, Nor since I did in euery part Sreewill resigne: It is not long, since in my sole Possession I did knowe my hart, And to be mine. It is not long, since euen and morrow All pleasure that my hart could finde, Was in my power: It is not long, since greefe and sorrow My louing hart began to binde, And to deuoure. It is not long, since companie I did esteeme, a ioy indeede Still to frequent: Nor long, since solitarily I liu'd, and that this life did breede My sole content. Desirous I (wretched) to see But thinking not to see so much As then I sawe: Loue made me knowe in what degree His valour and braue force did touch Me with his lawe. First he did put no more nor lesse Into my hart then he did view That there did want: But when my brest in such excesse Of liuely flames to burne I knew, Then were so scant. My ioies, that now did so abate (My selfe estranged euery way From former rest) That I did knowe, that my estate And that my life was euery day In deathes arrest. I put my hand into my side, To see what was the cause of this Vnwonted vaine, Where I did feele, that torments hied By endlesse death to preiudice My life vvith paine. Bicause I savve, that there did vvant My hart, wherein I did delight (My deerest hart) And he that did the same supplant, No iurisdiction had of right To play that part. The iudge, and robber, that remaine Within my soule, their cause to trie Are there all one: And so the giuer of the paine, And he that is condemn'd to die, Or I, or none. To die I care not any way, Though without why, to die I greeue, As I doe see: But for bicause I heard her say, None die for loue, for I beleeue None such there bee. Then this thou shalt beleeue by mee Too late, and without remedie As did (in breefe) Anaxarete, and thou shalt see, The little she did satisfie With after greefe. The end of the first booke. The second Booke of the second Part of Diana of George of Montemayor. [When I, poore wretch, of all men most accurst] When I, poore wretch, of all men most accurst, That neuer durst aspire to sweete content, In dolours spent, in miseries the first, Liu'd most secure, to pleasure onely bent: Which to preuent, The traiterous God of Loue With force did shoue into my carelesse brest Cares and vnrest of things, which I aboue All other things till then did scorne and iest: He thought (at lest) to be reueng'd of me, When he did see, that I scorn'd him alone Bicause that none should once presume to be So stout, as mocke his might so tride and knowne, Nor his high throne, nor his supreme estate: The Elfe of late hath plaide a suttell part, As with new art my ioies to ruinate: For often as he had essaid my hart With wounding dart of beautie to subdew, And with the view (not long since) of a face, Which tooke no place, for then in vaine he threw: A faire and daintie hand he did vnbrace, With such a grace, and to mine eies did show, And such a blowe he gaue me with the same, That then with shame his power I did knowe, For downe it threw me, my braue pride to tame. Tell me, how came it thus (faire hand) to passe, That so I was with such a blowe againe Throwne downe amaine, (neuer to rise, alas) By thee so fine and tender to be slaine? Alas, in vaine I tooke thee for a hand, For can it stand that nature did thee frame? Into the same, I thinke a mighty band Of Cupids powers of late transformed came My hart to tame, and dire reuenge to take, Since I did make so little of his powre: If now each howre for this thou dost awake Thy hawty force, my poore hart to deuoure: Be not so sowre, for pardon I doe craue, The which to haue, I promise to obay From day to day thy will, thy force and braue Commaund, and also to confesse, and say, That thou dost sway, more then the rest aboue, O God of Loue: And if that any nill Embrace thy will his follies to reprooue, I will aduise him how thy wrath doth kill. And euer will endeuour to reclame The freest harts vnto thy louing flame. [Cvpid was angrie with my merry face] Cvpid was angrie with my merry face, Bicause I euer laughed him to scorne, And all his followers (haplesse and forlorne) I mock't in publike and in priuate place: Wherefore he arm'd himselfe (to my disgrace) When time a fit occasion did suborne, But naught I wreckt his flames, in vaine outworne. For Satyrlike I did not them imbrace: Who seeing, that he built vpon the sand, If by a face my life he would deuoure, He shewed me then a fine and daintie hand, Which once beheld, it lay not in my power To be vnconquered Tyrantlike; nor would Deliuer me from him although I could. [It is a signe of valour and of might] It is a signe of valour and of might, A power, that in wonder doth increase, For any king to win (and neuer fight) A kingdome, and to enter it with peace. Proper it is for Mars to wound with hand: Mars woundes with hand, if angrie once he be: But now behold, the matter thus doth stand, That Cupid wounds with hand as well as he. And my good hap, or ill would haue it thus, That first of all my wofull hart should feele This new Alarme, wherewith he feareth vs. So with a hand, to which all harts may kneele, My hart he hath transfixt to make me knowe, His valour, strength, his wounding shaft, and bowe. [In each created thing] In each created thing One motion onely, and of might, Predominant continually is found. Which still doth keepe and bring The same, one way, and course aright, That's alwaies like, and vniforme, and round. And none can be vnbound From this compacted order though he would, None can againe the same forsake, Or any other take, And yet it would not though perhaps it could: Thou Fortune art alone Without it, in disorder onely one. That first, and highest Sphere, That mooues, and is not moou'd againe Of any other heauen, that mooues one whit: The which with his Careare, And swiftest course doth turne amaine The lowest heauens, and caries after it: An order doth admit, And doth maintaine, not erring in the lest: For it doth cary them with speede, And with more haste (indeede) The nearest heauen to it, from East to West: But rule thou dost disdaine, And onely without order dost remaine. The circled Elements Of qualities most opposite, The fire, the aire, the sea, and earth belowe, In motions not inuents A nouell course, but mooue aright, And euer keepe good order, as they goe: None erreth, no. The earth about his lowest Centre mooues, The water next in circle wise, The aire next that that lies, And fire to that a gallant order prooues: But Fortune in thy Spheare Thou run'st, without good order, rule, or feare. The heauie fals downe right (Vnlesse it haue impediment) Vnto the Centre of his proper Spheare: And that, which is but light, If that it haue an open vent, Mounts to his highest region euery where: And so each thing doth beare Good order, and good rule continually: In generation it doth spring, Corruption it doth bring, In fine, all things by order liue and die: Without it, thou dost range (Fortune) that with disorder still dost change. In this world nothing is (If out of order it be gone) But ordred it may be in time againe: Ther's nothing in blacke Dis (Though there be all confusion) Nor order kept (for there it were but vaine) But may indeede remaine In order, in their manner, forme, and kinde, And may be call'd to order fit, If we consider it: Though nought but paines and plaintes are there assign'd. Thou worse then hellish thought In no point canst not be to order brought. Thy motion out of kinde So far besides proportion lies, That it can neuer be to order brought: Swifter sometimes then winde, With hastie speede so soone it flies, That it is neuer seene, nor felt, nor thought: The Parthian neuer wrought, Nor sent an arrow out of steeled bowe With such great haste and maine: Sometimes with sloth againe, Like to the snaile or Tortuse she doth goe: Blinde Fortune thou dost reele, And more doth he, that sits vpon thy wheele. [That deluge of reuengement being past] That deluge of reuengement being past, Determined that was by Gods aboue, For guilt of wickednes of mortall men: The earth of moisture yet remaining full, Wherewith the heate of Titans beames conioyn'd, Strange creatures did engender of the same: Diuers in shape, proportion and in kinde. Amongst the which a Serpent did arise, Cruell, vntam'd, and greater then a hill, In Thessalie, a Prouince of great fame; That first put bridle to the horse his mouth. This monstrous Serpent did deuoure, and waste His natiue soile, and all the people there: He spared not the corne (a sweete rewarde And hope of him that did with labour sowe it) He spared not the strong and painfull Oxe, (The faithfull seruant of the countrey toyle) As little spared he the harmlesse Calues, Nor goates, nor kids, that skipt about the heathes. He spared not the flockes of simple sheepe, Nor gentle lambes, nor heards of grazing neate. He spar'd no house, nor of the little Bee The sweetest worke (the Mistresse of her art) This cruell beast had no regarde of men, For whose auaile each thing created was. But as the supreme Gods would not consent, With angrie hand to spoile the world anew: They did prouide forthwith a speedie helpe, Since humane skill and wit could not preuaile. For God Apollo going foorth to hunt, With bowe and quiuer full of wounding shaftes: Onely on Buckes his cunning aime to trie, On mountaine goates, wilde boares, and sauage beastes, He did by chaunce encounter with this Serpent; Which cruell monster when he did behold, He by and by contemn'd his wonted chace, To make his name eternall by his death. For straight he bent his hardned bowe of steele, And from his backe his golden quiuer tooke, And drew thereout his shaftes with wounding heads; Which dipt in poyson, he did shoote with force, And nailed them betweene the Serpents skailes, And there lay Python stretched on the ground. (For this the cruell Serpent had to name) Apollo haughty in his ioyfull minde, For glory of so great an enterprise, Remaining there, to view his noble spoiles, Proude with himselfe he did triumph so much For this great victory, that he did thinke That heauen had not a God like to himselfe; Which by his speeches he did manifest, Speaking sometimes vnto the monstrous beast, Sometimes vnto his quiuer, and his bowe; With ioy and pride did vtter foorth these wordes. Glorie of glories O most excellent, Triumph of triumphes O the most esteemed, Of victories O worthy victorie. O deede, aboue all deedes in honour deemed: O chance, then any chance more eminent: O fame of fames the sole supremacie. O happy war, whereby My arme so fortunate With power did abate The fiercest Serpent that was euer bred: O crowne most worthy for my conquering head. O bowe, that from complaining didst deliuer The people well nie dead, O happy shaftes, O braue and blessed quiuer. Python for thee the ground was barren still, Denying her increase, and wonted fruite, For thee, the learned Bee did aie lament, That she could not her sweetest worke salute: For thee, the gentle Ewe her selfe did kill, For griefe to see her lambe in peeces rent: For thee out of his tent The Shepherd durst not goe, For cleerely he did knowe, How much thy poysoned tooth and breath did harme: For thee the husbandman within his Farme, And Citizens within their wals for feare (Did in their Cities swarme) Of euerie shadow thinking thou wert there. What God deserues all the heauenly Quire Incense in sacrifice as doth Apollo? And what God by his skill and cunning art, As many as the firmament so hollow Containes, to such great titles doth aspire With honours type, renown'd in euerie part? For nature doth impart Her gifts, and euerie grace To me, their proper place. I did inuent the art of medicine, If any oze like prophet doth diuine, I am the God, that answers and inspires, My musicke passing fine Doth answer that the heauens make in their gires. A famous Sirname I shall now obtaine, O Serpent Python by thy mortall death: And I will cause, that they shall celebrate This libertie in neuer dying breath. With solemne sports and feasting to maintaine This glorie, in eternall time and state. And that this golden date In historie by fame, That streight doth blaze the same, And sparing such, as alwaies we do see, Neuer in this may such a niggard be. And though of others she doth prate too much, And speaketh partially, Not any lye herein, her toong shall touch. He therefore being in this sort content, By chaunce (and yet it may be to requite. The gen'rall scorne he made of all the Gods) The childe God Cupid passed by that way. (A puissant and mightie Lord of loue) A golden quiuer hung behinde his backe, In his left hand he bare a bended bowe: And in his right, two fine and prety shaftes. His eies were both bound with a silken string, Whom, now as soone as God Apollo sawe, Thinking that none, but he deseru'd to beare A bowe, and shaftes, and quiuer at his backe: In brauing sort these proud iniurious wordes, And full of scorne he thus to him affordes. What's he so proude, and stoute that doth impute him Worthy of those braue weapons in his hand? What, knowes he not that they are due to me; And none but I this honor may demand? T'is Venus sonne, God Cupid, it is he, So call'd, but heere he comes, I will salute him: Infamous villaine, theefe and voide of shame, And wicked robber of anothers fame. Be these thy tooles? Tell me, why dost weare them, That art a wanton, far for thee vnfit? Deliuer them, for these my hands diuine Doe beautifie, and on my shoulders sit With better grace, and honour then on thine, That art not able halfe ynough to beare them. Then little boy, leaue of with these to boast thee, If not, in faith, full deerely they shall cost thee. This furniture is proper to my might, These shaftes, this quiuer, and this bended bowe: With them I slew fell Python, that of sheepe Whole stockes within his belly did bestowe. And them to kill wilde beastes, and birdes I keepe, For onely these belong to me of right. With them (moreouer) if it be my will, With mortall woundes mine enemies I kill. Thy fires and flames should well content thy minde, With which (fond Loue) with loue thou giuest paine, Ioine not thy sportes, nor thy dishonest brandes With these braue weapons of my glorious gaine. Leaue then this bowe, dishonoured by thy handes, And see, if that thou canst, that art so blinde: Thine eies are blinded with a silken string, How canst thou then ayme right at any thing? Cupid at this waxt angrie and asham'd. But yet with threats to his vnworthie scornes, Nor with proude words in no wise would reply. For mightie Loue, as he is verie wise, And resolute of that he takes in hand, Cares not to bragge it out with threatning words: But doth performe it with most valiant deedes. But yet bicause his follies he should know, And how he was deceiued in his might, Which all the Gods besides himselfe had knowen (For yet Apollo neuer felt the paines, Nor cruell torments that braue Cupid giues) With gentle words proceeding from a minde, Incensed more within, then outwardly, To his braue termes this speech he did reply. Too proud thou hast thy selfe (Apollo) showen In speaking such vile words vnto my face. Such rather I embrace With honour, and I vse them not, but saying Nothing at all in such a wrong full case, I do such things as like were neuer none. Hearke then how I am knowen By word of mouth, and how much I am swaying. After by deed, I will bring thee to obaying. Neptune, and Ioue, and Vulcan I do keepe Vnder my mightie will: Few Gods there are, that with their skill, Do free themselues, but vnto me do creepe. The Goddesses do weepe To heare my name, and yeeld with mere consent Vnto my gouernment. And Venus, though my louing mother be, Cannot escape with partiall libertie. What man is he, neuer so strong in armes, That hath escaped in my amorous field? Here bootes not speare, nor sheeld, Nor Mars his weapons, nor his strong defence. In vaine he fights, whom I will haue to yeeld. Learning and wisedome here procure but harmes, And flie at my Alarmes, And staying do imprint a deeper sence Of louing passions, and with more offence. Women (mine ornament) do euer hide What neuer was concealed. For flames are hardly vnreuealed. The birds and sauage boastes my hands hath tide Vnto my yoke, beside, That Nature doth her selfe my chariot follow. Then tell me now Apollo, If that thou think'st to get such puissance, As that with these thou shouldst not come to dance. Thou dost reioice, bicause these armes are due To thee, for killing of that monster fell. But harke, and I will tell, How these belong more iustly to my might, Although thy shaft in wounding doth excell, It neuer yet but beastes and venison slew, Apollo, this is true. But mine shall wound thy soule both day and night: And thou shalt sweare, mine is the onely slight. So that how much each beast, not me, In mgiht thou dost exceede, And gett'st most glory by this deede, So much more famous shall my conquest be. But now thy follies see, In saying, that this quiuer, and this bowe Did me dishonor so. For thee, Apollo, better had it beene, If with my selfe the same thou hadst not seene. Thou saist I nill deserue this ornament, Bicause mine eies are blinded with a band; And therefore that my hand Must needes shoote false bicause that I am blinde. And yet, besides, I tell thee that they stand Against all reason, and intendement. Harke now, to what intent? And how this comes so fitly to my minde. Then tell me, if thou think'st it out of kinde, For any God to burne in feruent loue Of any woman heere? That more his greefes, and paines appeere, The more she should from him her liking mooue. If blinde, such things I prooue, And studie to reuenge me with my flight? Tell me, were it not right? Then take good heede, since thus my bowe doth kill: And makes thy reason subiect to my will. This said, he would no longer with him stay, Nor harken more to answeres nor replies: Nor did Apollo care to answere him, Esteeming nought his childish wordes, and threats. But Cupid wounding with his golden wings The loftie aire, that burned as he went, Without delay he gaines the shadowed top Of mount Parnasse, where looking round about He staies, and waites the meanes to venge himselfe At pleasure of Apollos proude contempt. Wherefore out of his quiuer he doth take Two wounding headed arrowes fatall both: In colour diuers and in their effects, For th' one procureth loue, with burning fire, The other hate, with cold and frozen ice. Golden is that, that causeth feruent loue, Leaden is that, that causeth frozen hate: And talking with them both, as though they did Conceiue his wordes, in this sort he did say. Come speedy out (my louing friendes) And shew your valour, and your force so high: In you my trust, and hope doth lie, That you will shew, whereon my strength depends. Beate downe Apollos pride, That heere our honour did deride: That he may know, how well my words agree With earnest deedes as shortly he shall see. Since thou, that art so sharpe and tride With kindling fire in each louing brest, Thou shalt Apollos hart molest, That cruell paines, and smartes he may abide. And thou that art of bluntie lead, Strike thou some womans hart so dead In cruell hate, that she shall neuer feele The sense of loue, no more then stone, or steele. Apollo there remained very glad, Calling the heauens, the elements, and beastes, The trees, the meades, the springs, the birdes, and fish To ioy with him in his renowned spoile, And victorie, by Pythons death he got: For in this sort with ioyfull face he said. O heauenly frame, Whose course, and sweete accents Giue earthly things their life, that ar Of natures name. You circled elements, So contrarie in secret war, You beastes, that far And neere, in earth doe make your dwelling place, You birdes, that in the skie With hastie wing doe flie, You fishes, that the christall streames imbrace, For my braue deede Come shew your selues content in ioies agreed. You shadowed treene, An ease of sweete delight, And fence from Titans burning heate: Faire meades and greene, And waters sweete and bright, This sorrest that with liquours weate: Greene Iuies seate, That liuest still, and dy'st not in thy kinde, And wind'st about the tree, That still vpholdeth thee: For this braue deed, Come shew your selues content in ioies agreed. Apollo being in this ioyfull moode, Behold where comes a fine and tender Nymph, And fairer then Aurora in her prime, Laden with spoiles, she got by hunting late, A Nymph endow'd with vertues high and rare The father oft vnto his Daphne saide (For so they say this fairest Nymph was call'd, And Pene was her aged fathers name) Daughter to me thou ow'st a sonne in lawe. Daughter, to me some nephewes thou dost owe. But with a teint, like the Vermillion Rose, Bespred vpon her face as white as snowe, To see her father would haue wedded her, The chastest virgine with her tender armes All Lilly white about the louing necke Of her deere father sweetely then did hang: Requesting him, that he would giue her leaue, To leade her life in spotlesse chastitie, And liue therein, as she had liu'd before. Her louing father graunted her request. But yet before to hinder her intent, With graue aduise vnto her he did tell, How heate of youth, and wealth, and beauties lure, Were contrarie vnto the chastest minde. And how that each of them alone is able To worke the tender hart like melted wax. How much more easie then, when all in one Were found, as in faire Daphne they did raigne. Yet though she did excell in all these giftes, She would not leaue to put her chaste intent In practise, and Dianas grace to serue. And saying, it was true her father spake. And said, if that she had such cause to vaunt That she was rich, and faire, and nobly borne: That it was tenfold deerer vnto her To be accounted chaste of euerie one. And that her chiefest honour did consist In honest, pure, and vndefiled life. Now therefore as the virgine did not know (Bicause her minde was so on vertue bent) What thing loue was, nor due of marriage rites, To hunt it was her onely ioy, and sport. Then hither came this gallant Nymph to chase, Where proud Apollo went by chaunce to hunt: Not thinking to finde out so farie a game. Bicause his breast, free from the thoughts of loue, Was onely bent in thinking of his spoile. He was so glad and did triumphe so much Within himselfe, that he did neuer thinke Of any thing but this, till (to his harme) He cast his wandring cies vnto the place, Where he did spie faire Daphne in her chace. [Apollo being in this heauenly ioy] Apollo being in this heauenly ioy, For victorie by Pythons death obtain'd, Lift vp by chaunce his eies, and spide the Nymphe (The fairest Nymphe as euer he did see) Whom at the first he onely did behold With an impartiall eye (a common thing) And onely markt her beautie, and her grace, And with that common kinde of honest loue, In praise of her these louing wordes did moue. What Nymph might yonder be, So fine with her dishieueled haire, That in this forrest hunteth all alone? I will goe neere to see, If that she be indeed so faire, As she doth seeme. Ah (Godheades) there is none In all your heauenly throne, No Goddesse, nor no power diuine, With beautie, and good grace, That nature doth imbrace, Then this, in whom most cleerely shine Her giftes, and chiefest art, As many as to all she did impart. But Cupid seeing her in such estate, Thought it high time to punish the contempt, And brauing words, that proud Apollo vs'd. And now to be reuenged on his head With more dishonor and with greater shame, He did prepare him to assaile his foe With those same weapons that were threatned him: So, with his headed shaft of beaten gold He smot his brest, and pass'd his carelesse hart; Omitting not to wound faire Daphnes to With that of hate, headed with heauie lead. And so with this the Boy remayned glad, And well did see, though blind what he had done. And thus content in minde, he did depart, Vpon some others to imploy his might. O blinded Boy, of strong and mightie force, Where none is found but onely in thy hands, That more the one with feruent loue doth burne, The more the other freezeth with disdaine. And proud Apollo now thou shalt perceiue, (That think'st no equall God to thee in heauen, Nor celebrated in the earth beaneth With such like honours, which thou claym'st alone) That there is one that raignes in heauen and earth, In hell, and euerie corner of the world, More puissant then any other God. Bicause thou art inuentor of the skill Of phisicke, and of musickes sweetest art; Bicause besides) thou tell'st with secret power, Things that are past, and present, and to come, Thou think'st thou raign'st alone as Soueraigne. Now art thou subiect to a sillie maide, Too base if she be paragon'd to thee: And yet this greeues him not, but that the more He loues this Nymph, the more doth she contemne His mightie loue, and all his vainest suites. Faire Daphnes hart is hardened and congealed In loue of this great God of heauen aboue: Apollos hart consumes with burning heat In loue of this poore maide in earth beneath. The God desireth to inioy her loue, And after this desire commeth hope. But here his Oracles deceiue him much: For in these things diuining is but vaine. So with this hope, which is but vaine, and false, He doth maintaine and feede his barren loue. And feeling with great paine his burning fire, To Cupid in this sort he mildly spake: What fire is it, that thus my breast doth tame, And yet no flame, I see that's manifest? Is this thy best reuenge, O Cupid tell, Fierce God and fell, which on me thou dost take? Hovv dost thou make the mightie Gods to bend, And dost offend the rich, the proud, and vvise, And dost despise and tame the great and small? So easie shall not flaxe, nor tovv be burn'd, Nor reeds be turned to fire laid thereby, Alas as I vvith thy reuenging games Do burne in flames: for thou hast made my hart To feele the smart of loue, and vvith thy might And golden flight, hast (cruell) vvounded it. Which thou hast smit, and smitten, stolne avvay, And made decaye of it vvithin my brest: Where novv no rest nor vvonted ioyes do dvvell. Then cruell tell the same vvhere hast thou put, Where hast thou shut my hart of sorrovv? vvhat, And is that, perhaps? O that it is. And novv in this faire forrest do they vse, Thus to abuse Gods harts, and steale and kill? From hence I vvill (Cupid) make thee my mate, And friend (though late) for euer thou shalt be, Since linked me thou hast in such a chaine. Her haire doth staine the golden Colchos fleece, Which out of Greece, Iason shall saile to seeke. Her face and cheeke enameled vvith red, With vvhite be spread, passing the Roses gay In moneth of May, that dare not come in place To see her face, nor yet the Lillie vvhite Approch in sight, vvhere her braue beautie shines. Aurora pines in seeing her, and dyes. Her tvvinkling eies, more then the heauenly lights In frostie nights doe shine, where Cupid skips. Her rubie lips with praise shall not be vouch't, But onely touch't, and kist of mine againe: Her necke so plaine, and smooth, nothing doth owe Vnto the snowe, for pure vnspotted white. What els (O spite) her wrongfull garments grudge To shew, I iudge, that nature made each part With such braue art, as neuer humane eies Did see the like, or heauenly thought deuise. Whilste God Apollo wandreth in her praise, Daphne with hastie foote doth flie away. Which when he did perceiue, these wordes in vaine (Continuing still his speech) to her did say. O thou the skies that dost excell, stay, stay; Fly not away so fast, thy friend I am: So flies the lambe from rauening woolfe away, The Hart againe, of cruell death afraid, With hart dismaid doth from the Lion flie; The doues doe hie them from their praying king With trembling wing, so each thing here belowe Flies from his foe: But Loue that burnes Apollo Doth make him follow thee with friendly pace: O see each place, whereon thy feete doe tread, With thornes bespread, vnworthily to beare them. The stones doe weare them like the slauing file: Then stay a while, and haste not so I pray. Sharpe is the way, and I for nothing would My following should make thee (faire Nymph) to fall. I pray thee, all I may, to moderate Thy hastie gate, and I with milder pace, To saue thy face from hurt, will follow thee. Oh didst thou see, and know but who it is, That mooueth his great liue vnto thee so, Thou wouldst I knowe not flie, but tarie still To knowe my will, and thinke that thou wert blest To be possest of such a Lord so high. I dwell not I, in this poore harren hill, Though heere I kill wilde beastes for my delight: I hold by right, as much as Tanais streames, And Titans beames doe see, where they arise: This I despise, but onely for thy sake, Where thou didst take thy beauties first of all. Which countrie shall be reard vnto the skies In all mens eies, vvith fame and dignitie: And lou'd of me more then th' Imperiall seate Of heauen so great, from vvhence faire Nymph I came. Neither I am a Shepherd, nor doe keepe Cattell, or sheepe, but vvhat loue doth commend To me to tend. In Delphos for mine honour, Of vvhich the ovvnour I am, incense burnes. Claros by turnes, and Tenedos likevvise Burne sacrifice to me: The lands vvhich great Xanthus doth vveat, vvherevvith such sudden voice I doe reioice the harts of them, that craue Ansvvers to haue by Oracle diuine. Delphos is mine, and famous there I am. Of birth I came more noble then the rest: For (at the lest) the Gods are kinne to mee. First in degree great Ioue my father is, And she ywish that raignes in heauenly seate, A Goddesse great (Latona) fairer then Faire Titan, when in all his chiefest pride Vnto his bride Aurora he doth hast: By me things past, and those that present be I know, and see, and things to come can tell: I do excell in verse, and sweetest song: With arme most strong I draw, my bow and flight: Where it doth light, it hits with sure wound: Yet haue I found, that Cupids certaine arrow Doth hit more narrow in my wounded breast, Where all my rest and pleasures it hath spent. I did inuent the art of medicine. My wit diuine found out the secret power Of euerie flower, and herbs whose vertues still Vnto my skill, and practise subiect bee. But woe is me, that neither herbe nor pill, Nor phisickes skill to loue no ease imparts. Nor that those arts, that profit euery one, Cannot helpe me their master all alone. Now running fast away betweene them both, Daphne to flie Apollos wanton vvill, Apollo follovving chaste Daphnes loue, Loue helpe Apollo vvith his speedy vvings, And vnto Daphnes feete feare tyed her vvings. And both sufficient fauours haue of both, But loue in fine doth ouercome pale feare, Bicause he is more forvvard, light and hot. But vvhen the Nymph did see herselfe surpris'd, And that the God embrac'd her in his armes: Lifting her hands and eies vnto the heauens, Succour she crau'd of all th' immortall Gods, Forgetting not her father demy God. And in this sort, besought their fauours all, Helpe each immortall power, For ioyntly all your helpes I do desire, And humbly do your fauours all inuoke: None I except out of the heauenly quire: O saue my virgine flowre: Be readie, else with force it will be broke. O let the earth deuoure, And swallow me within her hidden vaines With furious paines. Or else destroy my shape with thunder clap, Since this mishap It wrought. Helpe Pene now my father deere, If deitie be in thy riuers cleere. Scarce had faire Daphne ended her request, When by and by a trembling feare possest Her bodie with each member of the same. Hard barke did winde about her snow-white brest: Her golden haire was turned to greene leaues, Her armes into two long and branchie boughes: Her nimble foote, which was of late so light, Fastned remaind in rootes that could not stirre, And such like shape remaind in euerie part. Apollo deerely lou'd this Nymph in life, And now he loues her turn'd into a tree: Where thrusting his right hand into the barke Felt, that transformed Daphnes hart did yet Tremble, and quake vnder the same so new. He doth imbrace those fine and tender boughes, As though he would embrace her body yet, The wood he kisseth, but the wood disdaines His kisses, and doth seeme to bend away. So in this sort Apollo stood a while Speechlesse, and thinking of no other thing: After like one, that is amazed in minde, Not knowing whether he doth dreame or no, Vpon the Gods, and heauen he doth exclaime With angrie wordes of pitie and despite; Bicause they vs'd such rigour to his loue. For faine he vvould had Daphne to his vvife. But vvhen he savv it could not come to passe, He chose her for his tree and gaue to it Great honours, as the like had neuer yet: And in this great astonishment he said. What thing is this, vvhich I do see, Is it a dreame, or none? O that it vvere A fansie, or some vaine deceite, What, doe I erre? Or is it night, or day, what might I be? If it be true, I see a losse so great With many harmes my burning soule will threat. But yet awake I am, for in my right Hand Python dead, and headlesse I doe beare, And on my left arme weare My bowe, and low my quiuer and my flight. Why, this is Thessalie, Which this fell beast did waste both day and night, O woe, and after such a ioy so high, Must such mishap my sweete content deny? What hard and cruell God is that, That hath transform'd with enuie and despite Her goodly figure, and her face, Most perfect bright? Me thinkes, he nill deserues to banquet at The tables of the Gods, nor heauenly place, Since he hath wronged nature in this case. My skill and powers beare not such a sway, To change thee to thy former shape againe: And that snowewhite, And rosie face, which first did breede my paine: The reason is, bicause that none (Though neuer yet so learned any way, And though they ioin'd their vertues all in one) Can vndoe that, which one did doe alone. But now since all the fates so dire, And wicked destinies this good forbid, That thou my louing wife should'st be: Yet though they did With more despite against my will conspire, Thou shalt for euer be my louing tree, And I will neuer cease to honour thee. My yellow haire like shining threeds of golde, To honour thee, thy leaues shall compasse round: My harpe with siluer sound Thou shalt adorne, and quiuer shalt vphold: In all the world thy noble fame shall bide: And when triumphantly In honours chaire the Conquerour doth ride, Before them they shall carry thee on high, Lifting their conquest to the starrie skie. And as my faire and youthfull head Adorned is with lockes of dangling haires, Whereon were neuer yet imploid The little sheares: Euen so thy leaues shall neuer be destroid. And angry time thy honour shall not teare; But euermore greene bowes and leaues shalt beare. The lightning, that all creatures doth offend, And every thing of beauties pride bereaues, Shall neuer touch thy leaues: But be obedient to thee without end. From lightning to defend The okes, with them thy branches they shall reare, And euery where In honour of th' Imperiall palace gate, On portals they shall place thee with great state. This did Apollo speake vnto the tree, And gratefully the Laurell bow'd her top, In steed of moouing her new changed head: And with her new and tender branches made A signe that she with thankfull minde receiu'd These giftes and fauours, which that God did giue To her, while Laurell on the earth did liue. The end of the second booke. The third Booke of the second Part of Diana of George of Montemayor. [First shall these christall streames their courses backward mooue] First shall these christall streames their courses backward mooue, Before I will forget my sweete and deerest Loue. [If to my musickes skill] If to my musickes skill Apollo might his praises all resigne, And if (vnto my will) My speech were so diuine, That Mercurie for greefe thereat might pine. And if that eloquence So famous of Minerua sweete, did seeme yet but rude irreuerence To mine, and each one deeme it But harsh, and plac't with mine, but base esteeme it. And if I were adorn'd With hundred mouthes of iron, and like wit, Or if I had bene borne With Dimond toongs (admit) Or sawe my selfe in euery part so fit: The ruine, nor the fall Of those, whom Ioue from scaled heauen did throwe, Nor that great floud, when all The drowned world did flowe, I would not tell, nor time in them bestowe. Onely by me thy praise (O Chastitie) with honour should be told: And with thy heauenly waies I would no lesse vnfold Those goodly partes, that thou dost still vphold. Thou art a weeder out Of vices, from the place of vertues graine: And thou dost go about Our honours to maintaine, And dost our soules from cancred vice restraine. The onely way and signe Thou art, that doth the soule to vertue leade, A captaine most diuine, That vnder foote dost tread Thy foes: Thy fort and tower no force doe dread. Foule leacherie doth kill Reason, if that it conquered hath the same, And captiue to her will Doth make it (to her shame:) So to the maid the Mistresse subiect came. Thou chastitie dost free Reason (if to thy gate she bend her pace) In more supreme degree: And she in euery place Is onely free, that doth thy lawe imbrace. The soule with sweetest balme Thou fillest, and the senses dost refine, And therewithall, the palme Of beautie most diuine Thy figure beares, where brauely it doth shine. The vaine thoughts of the minde, Which reason cannot with her counsell tame, Nor friendly discipline, Thy wisedome doth reclame: And apt to each good art the soule dost frame. Being sincere, and pure, Thou ioinest vs to things pure, and sincere, And so thou dost assure Those, that thy robe doe weare, Friends vnto God, a conscience free from feare. In vaine I heere doe waste These wordes, wherewith thy praises I pretend: Better it were (at last) In action to commend Thee, then with words; And so I make an end. [O World, false world, and like to hell belowe] O World, false world, and like to hell belowe, Alake of filthinesse, and puddle mud: A sea, where teares and miseries doe flowe: A trauell without ease, or hope of good: A pit of sorrow, and of endlesse woe: A region full of brambles, thornes, and brakes: A meadow full of adders, toades, and snakes. A ceaslesse greefe, a false delight, and pleasure Of men that goe on wheeles, and dancing scope: Of him, that counteth thee his trust and treasure, And of thy worldlings, false and vainest hope: A heape of woes, that hath no end nor measure: A hideous hill of care, and dwelling place Of monsters, and of paine an endlesse race. A poison sweete, a hony full of gall: A dungeon of despaire, a dismall field Of wretchednes, of seruitude, and all Infections, that ten thousand deathes doth yeeld. A hell, a filth, a miserie, and thrall, A care, a greefe, a paine, a plague, a sore, A slauerie, a death, and what is more. Many that haue endur'd thy yoke of paine, Haue gone about in colours to depaint Thy wicked slightes, with which thou still dost traine Distressed soules vnto an endlesse plaint. And they poore soules haue labour'd all in vaine: But I, if that my greefe will suffer me, By triall can vnfold thy miserie. Thy properties so false I haue concealed, Thy wicked workes (till now) I haue endured: From thy deceits I neuer yet appealed, Feare of thy wrath my patient minde coniured To passe that, which I neuer yet reuealed. And not to play with thee (false world) at ouuert, But euer in thy blazons to be couert. Now without feare, for now I am assured, That more thou canst not doe, then done alreadie: Now may I boldly tell what I endured, (Although in vaine) to helpe my greefe so steady: Thus euer hath the want of feare procured The poore mans song, as by the way he goeth, Fearing no theeues, whose harme the rich man knoweth. O with the sweetenes false world thou dost glut vs Of thy enchaunted baites that doe delight vs, And in thy nets of pleasures thou dost shut vs, Where with thy hidden hookes thou dost requite vs: And after all when smoothly thou hast put vs In danger, then too open thou dost show them, When with resistance we cannot forgoe them. Thy promises are great, thy giftes are failing, And not to challenge them thou dost disdaine vs: In thy enormous vices we are sailing With winde in poope, where still thou dost detaine vs; And in the end though nothing then auailing, The shelues and rockes to vs thou art a showing, When backward our fraile barke cannot be going. Yet some, though few, haue left thee with aduise, Fearing thy sudden frowne and wonted pranks: And others (though too late they haue beene wise) To their good hap haue giuen a thousand thankes, Whose eares thy Syren songs could not entice, Seeing the pay that thou didst giue to mee For all the seruice I haue done to thee. And how for good with ill thou dost requite, Thou puttest out our eies, and then in vaine, With comfort wouldst annoynt our blinded sight: Thou woundest all, bicause none may complaine Alone, or feele the measure of thy spight, Saying it is an ease to wretched men In miserie to haue companions then. But wofull man vncomfortlesse, and sad, Alone in all this ill, and endlesse paine, The greatest greefe, that euer any had, Comparison with mine cannot maintaine: Disherited I am, in sorrowes clad: For Stela was the key of all my ioy, Helme of this ship, that lucklesse stars destroy. Tell me (false world) why didst thou me create A man? for not, Stela I had not got, Not got, not lou'd, not lou'd her, this estate Not suffred, nor intangled in this knot Of miseries, that is so intricate. Then world of woe, in wickednes so rise, What ease canst thou affoord to my poore life? O wretched world, in thee I doe remaine Against my will, thou maist commaund me then: And since thy snares, thy nets, thy hookes, thy chaines, With which thou dost deceiue vs silly men And our subiected wils vnto thy traine, Who shall accompany my wearied eies, And this old age from sorrowes warrantize? O Stela then, my loue, and all my good, My sweete companion, tell me, may it be, That this faire face, this figure, and the bud Of such braue beautie may be hid from me, And drowned in this deepe and wrongfull flood? O bitter chaunce, O Iupiter, O Gods, Is cruelty with beauty thus at ods? O wretched man, misfortunes onely white, What shall I doe, when I doe finde the place Sole, and alone, where whilome my delight was woont to be? O greefe and heauie case, When calling on her sweatest name, no wight, Nor happy answere soundeth in my eares To comfort me, but shewes of thousand feares? Then since she liues not, that did giue me life, Death shall be welcome and most sweete to mee: Dying with her, to end this cruell strife Of life and death (Sweete) I will come to thee. And weeping, where my cleerest light is hid, There wretched man my life I meane to rid. [Daughter, that in this deere] Daughter, that in this deere And christall riuer hast thy dwelling place With Nymphes: O harken heere To me a little space, Parisiles, thy wofull fathers case. Deny not him thy sight, Who euer did for thee himselfe despise: The absence of thy light, And heauenly shining eies, Vnto his soule a bitter death applies. With so consumes his breath, That liuing thus, his life he doth defie: For such a life is death, And he would rather die, Then leaue to liue without thy companie. Ioy now, (and doe not stay) An aged man consum'd with greefe, vnlesse That thou wilt haue him say, The loue thou didst professe To him, was all but fain'd, as he may gesse. Why dost thou stay so long A wretched soule with comfort to sustaine? O come and breake this strong, And mourning vale in twaine Of his affliction, miserie, and paine. My soule, thou woont'st with glee To heare this voice: but either I am not, As once I woont to bee, Or thou art chang'd, I wot, Or thy poore father els thou hast forgot. But first I pray to God, Then such obliuion in thy brest should bee, My vitall period May finish, not to see My selfe forgot of her, that loued mee. Come then my hart, and cleere Thee of this doubt, this fauour let me trie: If not, this riuer cleere Shall hide me by and by, For there with thee I meane to liue or die. [Parisiles, thy dolefull song and playning] Parisiles, thy dolefull song and playning, Thy piteous sighes, and weeping without measure (To comfort thee) haue made this goodly quire Leaue their aboades, and stately seates of pleasure. Afflict not then thy selfe, but cease thy paining, And let thy wearied soule to rest aspire: Let plains begun, retire, And be in ioy, and happy gladnes ended: And be not now offended Parisiles, or carefull for thy daughter; For hither we haue brought her In good estate, for thee to see her, knowing, That more then this to both we all are owing. If that the Gods are iust in any wise, Then are they bound to helpe those that doe pray To them for helpe, and in their seruice liue. Then since that you your selues did euer giue To follow them, and choose the better way In honouring vs by deede and sacrifice, The best we can deuise Of all good turnes, that may your loue requite, Belongs to you of right: Parisiles, the Gods in heauen doe knowe In sea, and earth belowe Thy things, and haue of them a greater care, Then thou maist thinke, and of thy happy fare. For which thing, they themselues had first ordeined That Stela, the most monstrous Shepheard flying, Should cast her selfe into this cleerest riuer, For knowing, what her fates and stars would giue her, Their influence with all their helpe denying By secret meanes her fortune, they restrained, And such a signe that rained Ouer her head, that threat'ned to destroy her, And present to annoy her: They therefore will she liue within our bowres, Vntill these lucklesse howres Doe passe, and while this signe and fate expires, Vnwoorthy her deserts, and high desires. The Sonne of Goddesse Cytherea shall Heereafter be the cause of her despaire: (The cruell) wounding her with doubtfull loue: And so this loue, that shall so doubtfull fall, Great strife in her, and many wars shall moue, Not knowing which to choose, that is most faire, Her brest (loues sweete repaire) Continually shall wauer on two men, Inclining now and then Her loue to one, then to another straight: Poore soule she shall await In this suspence, not knowing to define To whether of them both she should incline? And thinke not that th' immortall Gods intended To bar these loues, that heere I am declaring, Nor their successe would euer haue denied: For being to a vertuous end applied, Either of both they would not haue suspended: Alas, it is their fate such woes preparing, Not one nor other sparing. Both for one cause in one loue shall be chained, And both alike be pained: But yet the Gods shall euer be procuring, That, Stela then enduring These hardest haps shall not with those be placed, Whom Fortune alwaies checkes, and hath disgraced. But thou must comfort thee aboue the rest, If of these three, the hard and cruell fate Cannot be shunn'd; their ioies that must adiourne: After these woes Fortune shall make them blest, Shewing her face milde and propitiate, Gentle, and sweete: Then shall they cease to mourne, For she her wheele shall turne: Annoyes to ioyes, their sighes to sweetest songs Shall turne, and all their wrongs Shall cease: Their woes, their miseries, and teares, Their sorrowes, greefes, and feares Shall be one day conuerted into ioy, Which neuer after Fortune shall destroy. Thy daughter then (Parisiles) imbrace, And so restore her to this place againe, The heauens must haue their race: Then let them run: And cease to mourne in vaine. [Who comes into this place, let her take heede] Who comes into this place, let her take heede How she hath liu'd, and whether she hath kept The gift of chastitie in thought and deede. And see besides, if she hath euer stept, With wauering minde to forren loue estranged, And for the same, her first afection changed, May enter in Dianas Temple heere, Whose grace and vertues soueraine appeere. The end of the third booke. The fourth Booke of the second Part of Diana of George of Montemayor. [Phillis, my faire yoong Shepherdesse] Phillis, my faire yoong Shepherdesse, That from thee by and by I must depart (O heauinesse) O that no, but woe that I. O from the world that now I might depart, Since that I must (my ioy) forgo thy sight, For now I liue too long: Then kill my hart Mishap, if thou wilt grant me so much right: Or fat all sisters now consent, That she or I might die, I craue it to a good intent: O that no, but woe that I. Pardon, it is not I that doe desire Thy sudden and thy wrongfull death not, I. It is my loue, my hot and burning fire, That made my toong so much to goe awrie: And feare it is that mooues my hart, And thoughts of iealousie, Since thou dost stay, and I depart, O that no, but woe that I. Such iealousies they are not, thou must thinke, That thou some other loue wilt entertaine, For I doe knowe that loue can neuer sinke Into thy brest (vnto my cruell paine.) But iealousie thou wilt forget Heereafter, and denie That one did see another yet: O that no, but woe that I. But if thou dost (faire Shepherdesse) suspect To burie me in Lethes lake, let greefe, Before thou shouldst so ill my loue respect, Consume my life, let death be my releefe: Then thou shouldst thinke but such a thought, First (faire one) let me die: Although it shall be deerely bought, O that no, but woe that I. To rid my selfe from such a cruell paine, I would destroy my selfe, and purchase rest: But then to kill thee, I doe feare againe, Bicause thou dwellest heere within my brest: Doe then a noble deede (my life) From thence with speede to flie, That then I may conclude this strife. O that no, but woe that I. Bargaine with me, let me this fauour craue, To leaue my hart, that so thy harme doth dread, Thy place againe then after thou shalt haue, If thou maist come to it, when it is dead: For if thou once goest foorth, I will To death with courage hie, And then my vitall powers kill, O that no, but woe that I. As if it lay within thy handes and powre (Sweete Shepherdesse) forsake my wofull hart, But yet thou canst not goe from thence one howre, Neither can I, although I would, depart. Nor yet I would not, though I might, I say, I would not die, But yet bicause I loose thy sight, O that no, but woe that I. If that I am in any thing to thee Gratefull, this fauour then of thee I pray Thou wouldst, when I am gone, remember me, And say, where is my Shepherd all this day? Then would I count my greefe but small, If thou wilt not deny This thing, or thinke of me at all: Woe that no, but O that I. Then say but I, although it be in iest, And neuer mean'st thy promise to maintaine: Thou shalt thereby procure some little rest Vnto my parting soule, which I will faine: Little I craue to ease my hart, And paines, yet let me trie This fauour, Then I will depart. O that no, but woe that I. [Neuer a greater foe did loue disdaine] Neuer a greater foe did loue disdaine, Or trod on grasse so gay, Nor Nymph greene leaues with whiter hand hath rent, More golden haire the winde did neuer blowe, Nor fairer dame hath bound in white attire, Or hath in lawne more gracious features tied, Then my sweete Enemie. Beautie and chastitie one place refraine, In her beare equall sway: Filling the world with woonder and content: But they doe giue me paine, and double woe, Since loue and beautie kindled my desire, And cruell chastitie from me denied All sense of iollitie. There is no Rose, nor Lillie after raine, Nor flowre in month of May, Nor pleasant meade, nor greene in sommer sent, That seeing them, my minde deliteth soe, As that faire flowre, which all the heauens admire, Spending my thoughts on her, in whom abide All grace and giftes on hie. Me thinkes my heauenly Nymph I see againe Her necke and breast display, Seeing the whitest Ermine to frequent Some plaine, or flowers that make the fairest showe, O Gods, I neuer yet beheld her nier, Or far, in shade, or sunne, that satisfied I was in passing by. The meade, the mount, the riuer, wood, and plaine, With all their braue array, Yeeld not such sweete, as that faire face, thats bent Sorrowes, and ioy in each soule to bestowe In equall partes, procur'd by amorous fire: Beautie and loue in her their force haue tried, To blinde each humane eie. Each minde and will, which wicked vice doth staine Her vertues breake, and stay: All aires infect by fire are purg'd and spent, Though of a great foundation they did growe. O body, that so braue a soule dost hire, And blessed soule, whose vertues euer pried Aboue the starrie skie. Onely for her my life in ioies I traine, My soule sings many a lay: Musing on her, new seas I doe inuent Of soueraine ioy, wherein with pride I rowe: The deserts for her sake I doe require, For without her, the springs of ioy are dried, And that I doe defie. Sweete fate, that to a noble deede dost straine, And lift my hart to day, Sealing her there with glorious ornament: Sweete seale sweete greefe, and sweetest ouerthrowe, Sweete miracle, whose fame cannot expire: Sweete wound, and golden shaft, that so espied Such heauenly companie Of beauties graces in sweete vertues died, As like were neuer in such yeeres descried. [Neuer so true a subiect to great loue] Neuer so true a subiect to great loue, Put sounding Baggepipe to his mouth and toong: Nor euer Shepherd, that did keepe In any meade his silly sheepe, And neuer did so gracious members mooue Shepherd so faire, so lustie, and so yoong, In throwing of the barre, or steeled dart, As this my deerest friend, and louing hart. His songs and ditties, which he sung and plaied, Hath made the Satyres leaue the sweete pursute Of Nymphes, that they had chaced, And in their armes imbraced: And them besides, with his sweete musicke staied: Forgetfull of their feare (amaz'd and mute.) The hardest rockes he makes both soft and tender, And mildnes in great wildnes doth engender. Vnto his person, beautie, and his grace The Nymphes, and Napees faire to yeeld are glad: The Niades, Hamadriades, The Oreades, and Driades: For such a feature, and so sweete a face Paris, Alexis, nor Endimion had: The fairest in the world he doth despise But onely one, whom iustly he doth prize. Bicause that she may onely him admit, Her onely, and none else, he doth obay: She onely doth deserue Him, he but her to serue: She onely him, he onely her doth fit: For th' one is euen with th' other euery way: For he for her was borne, (for her alone) And she for him, or else was borne for none. So that if she had not beene borne at all, He had not lou'd, for he his like should want: And so she, to haue loued Her equall, it behooued That he was borne, For none but he should fall Equall to her, he then might iustly vaunt That she was borne, onely for him reserued, And she that he, whom onely she deserued. Fortune did fauour him aboue the rest, By making him the gladdest man that liues, If that perhaps she knew His loue so pure and trew, And faith so firme, within his constant brest, (She that her lights vnto each creature giues) In whose braue beautie nature strain'd to showe More art, and skill then euer she did knowe. The poore soule takes his greefe, and holdes his peace, Which to reueale he wanted meanes of late: Once did he goe about it, But straight then did he doubt it: With saying naught, his paine that doth increase He passeth, not to loose his woonted state: For though she be in all the world alone The fairest, yet as hard as any stone. Then (Shepherdesse) this rigour lay aside: And flie not him, that paines so much for thee: It is a great defect Such hardnes to detect: Let not so ill a thing with thee abide, Where each thing is, as good as good may bee. And since in thee there should be nothing vicious, Pay then the loue, thou owest vnto Delicius. [With sorrow, teares, and discontent] With sorrow, teares, and discontent, Loue his forces doth augment. Water is to meades delight, And the flaxe doth please the fire: Oile in lampe agreeth right, Greene meades are the flockes desire: Ripening fruit, and wheatie eares With due heate are well content: And with paines and many teares Loue his forces doth augment. [Since all my fortunes are so ouerthwart] Since all my fortunes are so ouerthwart, And so vnequall to my iust pretence, That where dame Nature (Mistresse of her art) Did make an end to frame each beauties part, There all my ils and sorrowes did commence: Anguish, and woes, fierce torments, griefe, and paine With their braue force my soule doe ouerrunne, That they doe worke it to their onely vaine, As blustring windes vpon the cloudes and raine, Or as the snowe that meltes before the sunne. And then since that my wet and wearied eies Were woont to be enuious once to see, Bicause they sawe the seate, where nature lies With all her treasures, and the chiefest prize, Of beautie, that in all the world might be: Now shall they onely seeke, and wish this hire (Continually in bitternes to weepe) Now shall they burne in swelling teares like fire, And now in lieu of seeing that desire, My cheekes in them shall neuer cease to steepe. Since th' absence of the Nymph, I loue so much, Hath deyn'd to beare me company of late, Then needes my life must languish, and be such, That greefes and sorrowes will not also grutch To follow absence, as their chiefest mate: And since my Star is hid, and gone away, Whereby my life and senses I did guide, I cannot choose but erre, and goe astray, And liue in senselesse darknes euery day, Finding no light wherein I may abide. And now exiled, shall my body flie (Since hard mishap the same did so oppresse) But yet my soule shall euermore be nie, And shall be neuer absent, though I die, From the sweete body of my Shepherdesse: And so if that my vitall powers quaile, Or bodie die by wandring heere and there, Impossible it is my soule should faile, Or death or danger should the same assaile, Accompanying her body any where. My soule for euer doth in her remaine, My body but for absence doth lament, That though my wretched body now is faine To wander heere, yet doth my loue restraine My soule to stay, that neuer would consent: Then (miserable body) once begin This sorrowfull departure with no wonder To feele with paine and greefe: And neuer lin To waile the cruell torments thou art in, With soule and body parting thus asunder: You shall my drenched eies, no lesse then this, Feele this great miserie, that greeues me soe, Your companie heere shall not be amisse, Since that you were the onely fault, ywisse, Of all my troubles, and tormenting woe. Then seas of teares begin to drowne your marge, And weepe for your attempt so rashly done, Let weeping be your office and your charge, And care no more to looke so much at large, Let it suffice, you sawe another sunne. The intellectuall and inwardeies Shall onely haue this charge, and care to see, And you my corporall, with mournefull cries, Bewaile my harmes, in which no comfort lies, Onely to you this office I decree. And those which are impassible at all, Shall see at length and in succeeding time Impossible and strange things to befall, And you, as passible heerafter shall Weary your selues by meanes of such a crime: For you they shall with double sight behold That shining blaze, that braue and glorious sight, Without the feare of hurt, and shall be bold With great delight their senses to vnfold On that, which did your lookes with harme requite. They shall behold that now I am, and was Condemn'd without the course of iustice lore, For if I did offend to loue her as My selfe, then I confesse this fault did passe To make me suffer, what I can no more. And of this thing I meane not to repent For happen will, what happen shall, to prooue Each amorous torment I am well content, And with goodwill with meere and franke consent I yeeld vnto the harme that comes of loue. In louing her, I doe all what I may, Though to my minde it falleth out amisse, I promise to forget her euery way, And that my loue for euer shall decay, If she would leaue to be what now she is. Alas she cannot leaue to be the same, A thing it is, her minde that well doth please, Hauing no peere in cruell beauties fame: Nor I cannot, but still maintaine this flame, Nor t'is a thing conuenient for mine ease: And if she said to me, with little loue, That it were best for me to hate and scorne, And should finde ease, if I began to prooue The same, I answere, that it doth behooue Me still to choose the worse, to worser borne. My piteous wordes she did condemne with fell And angry lookes, for telling her mine ill (Infernall greefe and to my soule a hell) That with such crueltie she should repell Me so, bicause I did obey her will: She bid me tell her (O accursed day) If that my torments were for her or no? And if I lou'd her so as I did say? She did commaund, Alas I did obay Why angry then, if she will haue it so? Weepe eies of earth O weepe, and weepe no more My miserie, and whether it doth tend: Eies of my soule, behold and then deplore My wretched state, what I was once before, And what I am, and what must be my end, O wofull life, O poore afflicted hart, Tell me (poore soule) how canst thou not but faile In passions of such torments, paine, and smart? With such a thought how dost thou not depart And perish when no succour can preuaile? O haplesse louer wretched, and forgot, Though happy once, and happy but of late: To day thou diest, but yet thy loue cannot, To day thy greefes begin their gordian knot, To day thy ioy doth end, and happy state: To day thy woes, and sorrowes doe appeere, To day thy sadnes, and thy paines are knowen, To day thy sweete content doth finish heere, To day thy dismall death approcheth neere, To day thy firmest loue, and faith is knowen. What doe you now mine eies, what doe you rest? Let out your flouds, whose streames in greefe doe swell: For it may be, you may within my brest Quench out this burning flame, or at the lest, Coole this great heate that burnes like Mongibelle? But woe is me, I striue but all in vaine Against the streame: For golden Tagus streames Nor Duetus floud, nor Iberus againe, Can quench this heate or mitigate the paine, How then my teares? Alas, these are but dreames, And in such sort, bicause it doth offend My hart, that burnes like to the smithie flame, For it doth more increase, and doth extend, And more it doth with sparkling flames incend, The more that water's cast vpon the same: And now since want of hedgrow faileth me, And that I feele increase, not want of paine, I thinke it best for me to goe and see, If I can finde some other hedge or tree, To write that there, which this cannot containe. The end of the fourth booke. The fifth Booke of the second Part of Diana of George of Montemayor. A Sonnet. [If teares we spill by louing, and bereaue not] If teares we spill by louing, and bereaue not, Our harts of troubles, which for loue we faine not, Dainties they are of loue, which we obtaine not, Dainties they are of loue, which we conceiue not: If that by louing passions we desire not, And sighes for loue, wherewith we doe complaine all, Dainties they are of loue, which we disdaine all, Dainties they are of loue, which we require not. The false suspectes to be of all eschewed, The iealousies of euery Mistresse mooued, Dainties they are of loue not well aduised: To faine not, without why not to be loued, To thinke not, without cause, not to be viewed, Dainties they are of loue of all despised. [Ah well away how firme and suer ar] Ah well away how firme and suer ar Torments, and paines in each true louers hart: For when I thought that I did wander far, And changed place, this fierce and amorous war, And wounding greefe would from my soule depart. Yet now in fine by proofe too well I knowe, That greefe, and sorrowes, absence doth not kill, As some doe say; but makes them more to growe: And wit so deerely bought with double woe, Is bought (I needes must say) against my will. I goe from place to place, and neuer yet My haunting greefe, and cares doe goe away: I am so diuers in my wandring wit, That in one place I neuer rest, nor sit, Yet still the same are sworne with me to stay. My fainting legs my drooping bodie beares From place to place, and yet fierce paine sustaines, It is so seasoned with my swelling teares, That since my Life of late my loue for sweares, All comforts that I offer, it disdaines. My cruell paine, wherewith my life is spent, I would contemne, and would but little make, If that my Mistresse would in minde consent, That I should beare this ceaselesse punishment Onely for her for her most sweetest sake. But that which makes so wide, and deepe a tent Of greefe within my hart, and makes it die, As often as I thinke how she is bent, Is, that to that she neuer will relent, Where remedie, nor any helpe doth lie. After that loue so strong and firme a fort Had built within my brest, vnto his minde, Louing, a death I rather would support, Then now to liue after another sort, Or for my selfe in libertie to finde. For speedie death I knowe must be my fate With such a life, as now I doe endure, With mine owne handes to end this hard debate, To cruell death I will set ope the gate, And in my brest will lodge it most secure. Who doubts that if but once she came to knowe My greeuous paines and passions which I feele, But that to me some pitie she would showe, Though in her brest, where pitie yet may growe, She had a hart harder then any steele. Who doubtes, if that she did but knowe the smart, Her louer feeles, his plaintes and endlesse mone, But that she would with milde and gentle hart Pitie his case, although she had each part Of it, as hard as craggie Dimond stone. Orpheus, when descended into hell For faire Euridice his wife, and past The triple-headed-dog, that did not yell, Nor barke, the Fiends that in Auernum dwell, Made not so milde, at his sweete sound agast, As my tormenting passions, and my paine Would mooue the hardest hart to heauinesse, And euery hart in all the world againe, And not without great reason, nor in vaine, But that of my most cruell Shepherdesse. Ah woe how haue I thus deluded beene? How haue I liu'd deceiued in this art? Since that so simply I did ouerweene, That there could be no difference betweene Her fairest face, and her most cruell hart. What man betwixt the cope of heauen and hell Is there of wit so simple and so slender, That could but thinke, or once imagine well, That such a hard, and cruell hart could dwell In such a daintie bodie and so tender? What humane wit (O greefe that I doe see it) Would euer thinke that crueltie possest Her hart, or such a Tygresse hart to be yet Placed in her, whose outward shew to me yet Should promise peace, and in so milde a brest? Who would haue thought (it almost was in vaine) That from her toong, distilling honie drops, So fierce an answere should proceede againe, And wordes she vttered with so great disdaine, Bittrer to me then gall, or wildest hops. And, that I am deceiued in this ground Of my faire Nymph, I ioy with all my hart: Bicause I would not thinke, there could be found In so great good a thing, that should redound To so great ill, and to so bad a part. It shall be therefore best for me ywisse Not to suspect in her so foule a crime, That she is hard, or that she cruell is, But my mishap, that euer went amisse Euen from my birth-day to this very time. Bicause my paines should neuer be aboue My ioies, and care before my sweete content Should come: I am most constant in my loue, Sans widowhood, like to the turtle doue, That losse of her companion doth lament. In liuing, and in louing too amaine, I thinke I goe beyond her euery howre, But yet I am not like to her againe, In that I did not first a sweete obtaine, Before I tasted of a bitter sowre. All that my wofull minde should recreate, The water, that is christall pure and cleere, I cannot choose, nor otherwise but hate, Bicause I would not see so bad a state, And such a haplesse body wander heere. Like as the snake, or adder that doth bite I flie, with hastie foote, and doe not stay In any place, where greene may giue delight, For this doth leese his hew, and vigour quite, Where hope begins to faile and to decay. If musing all alone by chaunce I stay Vpon my greefe, that smallest ioy denies, And see some spring or fountaine in the way I flie, and softly to my selfe I say, Let that suffice, that runneth fro mine eies. And if in taking some poore little pleasure (If pleasure in a haplesse state I take) And view the greene, the countries hope and treasure, I flie, and say, that hope of death must measure My minde with ioy, that doth my pleasures make. According to my life in great disgrace, And miseries, euen from my mothers wombe, I thinke (and as I am in such a case) That if I follow death with happie pace, Death will not yet vnto my succour come. I thinke sometimes (alas weake is my might) To giue my selfe some comfort and some rest, But they doe flie from me by day and night, In me (poore wretch) they can take no delight, And so my paines doe double in my brest. It wearies me (for greefe doth euer range) To be so long together in a place: Yet my vnwearied greefes doe neuer change Their place, but still my seldome ioies in strange And cruell manner from my brest doe chace: Heere stay my song, and tell the world my smart, And let this tree with thee haue neuer end, For with me shall my haunting greefe depart, For it will neuer leaue my wofull hart, Like to a trustie good and faithfull friend. [Stela mine onely Goddesse, and my good] Stela mine onely Goddesse, and my good, Whiter then is th' vntrodden snowie way, And redder then the rose, but late a bud Halfe blowen, and pluckt with deaw by breake of day: To see more gracious then the Plane tree shape, And sweeter then the ripe and swelling grape: More pleasant then the shade in sommer time, More then the sunne in winters coldest prime. More fresh then any coole and trembling winde, More noble then the fruit, that orchards yeelds, More iocund then the tender kid, by kinde When full, it skips and runs about the fields: More flowrie then the rich and pleasant meade, With painted flow'rs in mids of May be spred: More soft then spotlesse downe in Cygnets brest, More then the milke, and cheese curds yet vnprest. More shining then cleere christall and transparent, And finer wasted then the Cypres tree, Straighter then is the Poplar eminent, Placed amongst those trees that lower be More cleere then ice, or any frozen raine And (if in onely this thou dost disdaine, Bicause it is with more perfection filled) More faire then any Orchard that is tilled. And yet with this more fierce and more vnstaied Then Bull, that yet was neuer tam'd with yoke, Prouder then Peacocke with her taile displaied, Harder then old and knotty sturdie oke: More then the rocks immooueable, and madder Then angrie snake, or cruell trodden adder. More furious then the swiftest streames: then thornes More sharpe and pricking with thy singing scornes. More deafe then is the sea, to my desires: Then smoothest streames more full of deepe deceate, Stronger vnto my paines then greatest fires, More cruell then Beare, that giues the teate: Then Sallow wand, or Osier that is weake, If it be greene, more hard and tough to breake. More contrarie vnto my ioy, and rest, Then hungrie woolfe to tender lambkins brest. And that which doth increase my cruell paine, And doth reuiue my hot and flaming fire, By knowing which, it hath my comforts slaine, And hope, whereto in thought I mought aspire, Is, that thou art not onely swifter, then The Hart pursude of hounds into his den, But swifter then the swiftest blowing winde, Swifter then time, then thought within the minde. Suer I am, if well thou hadst me knowne, (Stela my life) from me thou wouldst not flie, Or sometimes yet from me if thou wert gone, Thou wouldst returne without my call or crie: And if thou didst stay there but somewhat long, Then wouldst thou thinke thou didst thy selfe great wrong: I knowe that this will greeue thee at the hart, To see me passe for thee such paines and smart. A Caue, that doth containe the better part Of this great hill, hewen out of quarrie stone, Serues for my rocke, the which is of such art, That there the Sommer sunne is neuer knowne, Nor winters cold is felt within that place, But apples there doe hang in maruellous grace Hard by the ground, that shade in hottest weather, And loade the boughes, they hang so thicke together. Clusters of grapes doe beautifie my vines, Some golden, purple red, all faire and full, Of part whereof I make most daintie wines; And part of them I keepe for thee to pull: And with thy hands most delicate and faire Gather thou maist ripe plums by goodly paires, Vnder the shadowes of their boughes, to ease thee, And Apricocks, and cheries if it please thee. Heere haue I damsens, nuts, and coloured peares, And peaches fine, that would each eie inuite: And euery tree, and fruit this Iland beares, All for thy seruice, pleasure, and delight: And as my hart to please thee I haue bowed, And so haue these the selfe same office vowed: In Autumne (if thy husband I might bee) Chestnuts, and Medlars I will keepe for thee. As many flockes as heere thou dost behold, Which in these banks I feede with mournefull song, And many more within these hils vntold And woods and vales estray, to me belong: Many that lie in shades along this coast, All which to tell were but a labour lost. For poorest men they say, are woont to keepe, The number of their cattell and their sheepe. The praises which, I vaunt vnto thee heere, I will not thou beleeue in any sort, Thine eies the same shall witnes very cleere, If so thou please, and not my bare report: I durst be bound, that if thou cam'st to trie, Thou wouldst affirme I told no tale nor lie: Since that to milke them all I am vnable, Or ease their bags, trust me, this is no fable. I haue likewise shut vp in shadowed places (All by themselues) great store of gentle lambes, And little kids, with spotted skins and faces, Of equall age new weaned from their dams: In many other houses large and wide Great store of wanton calues I keepe beside, And milke doth flowe within my caue, whereby My cunning in this manner I doe trie. Profit thereof in diuers sorts I make, Leauing the thinnest of it to be drunke, Some part of it within a charne I shake, And beate it there a while till it be shrunke: Some part againe for tender cheese I dresse, And into that, iuice of an herbe I presse. And yet some part whiter then Ermins skin I turne to curdes, and put some creame therein. Yet will I giue thee greater giftes then these (If thou dost reckon these but poore and small) Wilde boares, and goates and bucks shall be thy fees, Conies, and hares, and hounds to hunt withall. Two turtle doues I tooke out of their nest In bignes, colour, and in all the rest So like, that them hardly thou shalt descrie, Although thou markest them with narrowest eie. I tooke them from that tree in yonder ground, For thee to play with all when thou art wearie; Two little whelpe beares after this I found And brought them home to sport and make thee merie: Both these and them I nourish to delight thee, If thou but with thy comming wouldst requite mee: And finding them I said I would reserue them For thee my Stela, who dost best deserue them. Come Stela then out of thy watry brooke And see how I am staying for thee heere, To my request vouchsafe a gracious looke, Calling vpon thee with most heauie cheere: Yet thy disdaine (as I hope for the best) Will not deny my pitifull request, When that thou know'st my wealth without compare, My selfe of person nimble, stout and faire: I did behold my selfe not long agoe Within a fountaine cleerer then the skie, I view'd my selfe from top vnto the toe, And without doubt my person pleasd mine eie: Your Iupiter, and euery heauenly creature Enuies my stature, and my comely feature: Your mightie God, to whom you sacrifice, And honour so, whose Godhead I despise. Behold againe what curled lockes of haire Falling vpon my shoulders, and my face, And goodly beard doth make me seeme so faire, And to my person giues a manly grace. Thinke that my body is not foule therefore, Bicause of bristled haire it hath such store. Foule is the tree when Autumnes course bereaues Her boughes of fruit, of greene, and comely leaues. How lookes the horse that hath no crest, or maine, Nor bushie taile to grace his body foorth; How lookes the hauke that hath no wings, nor traine, Faire is the wooll of sheepe and mickle woorth. The man lookes bald that hath no comely beard, And as with sprites he had beene lately feard: Then foule I am not with my beard, and haire, Since with the same I am more perfect faire. Besides all this I come of no base blood, For God Syluanus is my noble Sire: Thy father he shall be, if thou thinke good; Then pitie me, and graunt me my desire: Harke then to me, scorne not to see my paine, Let not my sighes and teares be spent in vaine: Onely of thee, and humbly I doe craue Of this poore wretch some pitie now to haue. I which doe scorne the furious thunder blowe Of Iupiter, and other Gods despise, Thee, Stela, for my Goddesse I doe knowe, And come to thee with humble weeping eies: More then his bolts thy anger makes afraid, And pearcing eies my senses haue dismaid: Thou dost deserue more honour, praise, and loue, Then Iupiter, or all the Gods aboue. It would not halfe so much haue greeu'd my hart, That thou my loue so strongly didst denie (Being so faire, and such one as thou art) If (as from me) from others thou didst flie: But since Delicius (wherein thou dost erre) Before stout Gorphorost thou dost preferre, His small imbracements, and too far vnmeete Thou louest more, then mine so great and sweete. But let him swim in seas of his delight, And with thy fauours let him now preuaile: If time, and place be graunted to my might, Soone will I make him strike his puffed saile, Soone shall he feele my strong and sinewed arme, And how it will his amorous senses charme: O greefe, that time and place doe not affoord, To make my deede as currant as my word. If, with my handes his tender trembling flesh I will dishiuer, and in mammocks teare, And then his bones in peeces I will thresh, And in the forrest, cast them heere and there: And dye the riuers with his blood I will, And throwe his members from this steepie hill Into thy lap, where, laughing, I will stand To see, if there he ioyneth hand in hand. O woe is me, that thus tormenting greefe, And wrath doth make my toong to goe awrie: O thoughts, that feele no hope, nor hope releefe: In Aetnas flames I liue, I burne, I die: I burne (O greefe) and die, thou wilt not end To succour me, that am thy louing friend. If thus thou handlest those, that languish for thee, How wilt thou those intreate, that doe abhor thee? The end of the fifth booke. The sixth Booke of the second Part of Diana of George of Montemayor. [Louers, record my memorie, and name] Louers, record my memorie, and name, For one that is more happie then the rest: And solemnize my conquest and my fame, Which I haue got in being onely blest: Extoll my glorie to the loftie sunne, Which with this famous triumph I haue wonne, To be the happiest man, that hath beene borne, Of all, that haue to loue allegeance sworne. What louer yet was found vnto this howre (Though in his loue most fauour'd he had beene) Of greefe that had not tasted yet some sowre, And had not felt some paine, and sorrowes seene? Or who hath with such sweete his loue endured, (Though of his Mistresse he were most assured, And though she loued him with truest hart) That felt not yet a little iealous smart? Amongst all these, I onely am exempted From sorrowes, troubles, from mishaps and paines: With both handes full I liue in ioies contented: And more if I did tell, yet more remaines: Secure I am, that in my happy brest Vile iealousie shall neuer build her nest: And that I may with greefe be neuer paid, A strong and firme foundation I haue laid. Nothing in all the world shall breake this chaine (If cruell death doth spare me with her dart) And yet if loue in sepulcher remaine, Death shall not there dissolue it in my hart: See then how that most strong it needes must be, Since to my will I wrought the same in me. And for you may not say that I doe mooue it With blazons, barke with reasons I will prooue it. Who to himselfe could be so inhumane (Vnlesse he were depriued of his wit) That swimming in a pleasant Ocean Of ioies, would wish for greefe, not finding it. Such ioies I taste, as neuer more I could, My loue admits no sadnes, though I would: For (yet admit) that I would now procure it, My loue is such, that it will not endure it. I haue good fortune at mine owne commaund, Since I haue fauours at mine owne free will: My loue to her, her loue to me is pawn'd, Which fortunes spite and time shall neuer spill. But now if ought with greefe my minde may mooue, It is, to haue Corriuals in my loue: But they my ioy, and glorie doe augment, For more they are, the more is my content. If any care for these Corriuals dooe (These faithfull louers) in my brest remaine, Then see, how that with earnest suites I wooe, And seeke them for my Shepherdesse againe: And (truly) if it lay within my power, A thousand I would send her euery hower: But since I am so rude, and but a clowne, I cannot set her golden praises downe. If that with all the faire one should resort, Shewing her vertues, and each goodly grace: Little should then my homely praise import, Hauing the world at her commaund and trace: For (saying naught) her praise she better would Her selfe disclose, though I said all I could: And how much more, since I want skill, and art, Of her to blazon foorth the meanest part. But now behold how far from that aboue I haue estraied (my promise and intent) My promise was, with reasons now to prooue, That crosse, nor care my ioies could not preuent. I know not, if by rashnes, or aduice, It was my thought, that did my toong entice? For when I thinke to praise my Shepherdesse, Then straight my toong doth in her fauour presse. It takes no heede, and hath but small remorce, To whom, what, where, how oft, why, how and when Her praises be, nor of her little force, Nor vertues of this fairest one: But then, All in a heate, her praise begins to babble, And I to stay such furie far vnable: For thousand times I sharply chide the same, But more I chide, the more it is to blame. Counsell I giue it, and with counsell threate, That neuer it presume to meddle heere, By telling it, it is too base a seate For her high praise, that neuer had her peere: But shamelesse it replies: let this not greeue thee, And boldly saies: T'is true I doe beleeue thee. For I confesse I neuer did suffice, But such a want I hope my will supplies. As to a foole, seeing her follies such, Sometimes I yeeld at length, to leaue the raine: If then my Nymph so basely it doth touch, It doth deserue no punishment, nor paine: For howsoere she praise her: In the end I feare not, that my loue it will offend: But to returne fro whence my toong did run, Breefly I will conclude what I begun. Another Cupid raignes within my brest, Then Venus sonne that blinde, and franticke boy: Diuers his works, intent and interest, His fashions, sportes, his pleasure and his ioy No slightes, deceites, nor woes he doth inspire, He burnes not like to that vnseemely fire: From reason, will my loue cannot entice, Since that it is not placed in this vice. For beautie I loue not my Shepherdesse (Although she may be lou'd for passing faire) Beautie in her the lest part doth possesse, (Though hers doth make all others to despaire) For mildnes, wisedome, and for vertues sake, This zealous loue I first did vndertake: And so my loue is honest, chaste, and sure, Not wanton, fleshly, filthie, nor vnpure. I wish my flockes greene grasse may neuer finde, Nor cleerest springs, their burning thirst to slake, Nor shades enioy in heate, nor coolest winde, And that they may no profit to me make, That March may come with rigour, to their harme, And sheds and sheltor want to keepe them warme, If euer any wicked thought had past My loue, but what was honest, cleene, and chaste. The Iuniper oile may neuer helpe my flockes, With lothsome mangie being ouerrun, Milke faile my sheepe, decay my countrie stockes And little kid by hunger be vndone: And let my masty lay him downe to sleepe, So that the woolfe doth kill him, and my sheepe, If in my loue I euer had inuention Of wickednes, bad thought, or bad intention. But thinke not that my loue so chaste and pure, Without the slaine of vaine and wanton thought, And louing so sincerely, and so sure, From vertue of mine owne proceedeth not: Onely from her alone it is proceeding, That no foule thought doth suffer to be breeding: Dishonest motions in a fleshly soule Her modest sight most brauely doth controule. For plainly, and not vainly, I suspect, That if some boldface yonker did bewray His wanton loue, or did to her detect His thoughts, that did from honestie estray, In looking on her onely, I durst sweare, His wordes would freeze within his mouth for feare, And that he could not onely speake for shame, But neuer durst againe presume the same. If in this song I purposed to touch Her honestie, and vertues to explaine, I knowe I am not worthy for so much, When thousand bookes cannot the same containe: And more, that once I somewhat sung, and saide Before, and that my voice was then afraide, For being so base: Now must it erre, as lately, Since that her praise is growne more high and stately. Then louing, as you see, with such successe, I doe not feare disfauours any whit, Musing alone on my faire Shepherdesse, Fauours doe come by heapes, my minde to fit, And so of her I neuer beg, nor craue them, But in this sort continually I haue them: As many as my handes can hold and borrow, Wherefore I liue in ioy deuoid of sorrow. Louing in this same sort, there is no feare Of iealousie, that's either true or fained: A riuall heere sweete companie doth beare, And all that in chaste loue in one are chained: Yet name of Riuall fits not well this place, Since chastitie together all imbrace: Nor different mindes we can be said to carie, Since our intents in no one point doe varie. Come then all you that loue, come by and by, Leaue euery one his Shepherdesse, and loue, Come loue my Shepherdesse, and for her die In that that's pure, and commeth from aboue: And you shall see how that your fortunes far It dignifies, to loue this radiant star Of vertue, and the time you shall auerre Ill spent, that is not spent in louing her. [To Luztea faire I do belong, this collar can auouch it] To Luztea faire I do belong, this collar can auouch it, Let no man therefore be so bold, without her leaue to touch it. [If that a small occasion had the power] If that a small occasion had the power, To make thee leese thy rosie hew and colour, Diana, say, how fals it out this hower, That all my woes to pitie make thee duller? Hath now a little peece of paper made thee So milde, and gentle in so short a morrow, And cannot yet my greatest loue perswade thee, To make thee take compassion of my sorrow? How of my selfe am I my selfe ashamed, That thou shouldst reckon of so short a writing, Which cannot iudge, nor vnderstand thy graces? And yet thou wilt not bend thee to requiting Of that, that's written in my hart inflamed, And which hath alwaies suffred thy disgraces. [A faire maide wed to prying iealousie] A faire maide wed to prying iealousie, One of the fair'st as euer I did see: If that thou wilt a secret louer take, (Sweete life) doe not my secret loue forsake. Eclipsed was our Sunne, And faire Aurora darkned to vs quite, Our morning star was done, And Shepherdes star lost cleane out of our sight, When that thou didst thy faith in wedlocke plight: Dame nature made thee faire, And ill did carelesse fortune marrie thee, And pitie, with despaire It was, that this thy haplesse hap should be, A faire maide wed to prying iealousie. Our eies are not so bold To view the sunne, that flies with radiant wing, Vnlesse that we doe hold A glasse before them, or some other thing: Then wisely this to passe did Fortune bring, To couer thee with such a vaile: For heeretofore, when any viewed thee, Thy sight made his to faile: For (sooth) thou art, thy beautie telleth me, One of the fair'st as euer I did see. Thy graces to obscure, With such a froward husband, and so base, She meant thereby, most sure That Cupids force, and loue thou shouldst imbrace: For t'is a force to loue, no woondrous case. Then care no more for kinne, And doubt no more, for feare thou must forsake, To loue thou must beginne, And from hencefoorth this question neuer make, If that thou should'st a secret louer take? Of force it doth behooue That thou should'st be belou'd: and that againe (Faire Mistresse) thou shouldst loue: For to what end, what purpose, and what gaine, Should such perfections serue? as now in vaine. My loue is of such art, That (of it selfe) it well deserues to take In thy sweete loue a part: Then for no Shepherd, that his loue doth make, (Sweete Life) doe not my secret loue forsake. [If that the gentle winde] If that the gentle winde Doth mooue the leaues with pleasant sound, If that the kid, behinde Is left, that cannot finde Her dam, runs bleating vp and downe: The Baggepipe, reede, or flute, Onely with ayre if that they touched bee, With pitie all salute, And full of loue doe brute Thy name, and sound, Diana, seeing thee, A faire maide wed to prying iealousie. The fierce and sauage beastes (Beyond their kinde and nature yet) With piteous voice and brest, In mountaines without rest The selfe same song doe not forget: If that they staid at (Faire) And had not passed to prying (Iealousie) With plaintes of such despaire, As moou'd the gentle aire To teares: The song that they did sing, should be One of the fair'st as euer I did see. Mishap, and fortunes play, Ill did they place in beauties brest: For since so much to say There was of beauties sway, They had done well to leaue the rest. They had ynough to doe, If in her praise their wits they did awake: But yet so must they too, And all thy loue that woo, Thee not too coy, nor too too proud to make, If that thou wilt a secret louer take. For if thou hadst but knowne The beautie, that they heere doe touch, Thou wouldst then loue alone Thy selfe, nor any one, Onely thy selfe accounting much. But if thou dost conceaue This beautie, that I will not publike make, And mean'st not to bereaue The world of it, but leaue The same to some (which neuer peere did take) Sweete Life doe not my secret loue forsake. [Faire Shepherdesse, what hast with greefe to fill me] Faire Shepherdesse, what hast with greefe to fill me, And how long dost thou purpose to destroy me, When wilt thou make an end with woundes to noy me, Not stretching foorth thy cruell hand to kill me? Tell me the cause, why dost thou so much will me To visit thee, and with such words dost ioy me? That to my death I rather would imploy me, Then by such present pangs and greefes to spill me. Woe to my soule, since this doth cause thy sorrow, That such a little fauour thou hast done me, Little it is, in sooth, if it be peased With all my teares, that neuer yet haue ceased To fall, that to my death haue almost woon me: They great, this small, those giue I, this I borrow. [Thou dost desire (My life) as thou dost say] Thou dost desire (My life) as thou dost say, To see me in thy loues inflam'd (at lest) And yet an vncouth meanes thou dost suggest, Which is, to giue me care from day to day: Dost thou not see the fier to decay, Waxe cold, and quench't, within my louing brest With swelling teares, which trickle without rest Out of mine eies, to see thy hard delay? The meade with raine her goodly greene redeemes, The oile doth in the lampe the flame maintaine, And loue with teares augmented is no lesse: But loue, the lampe, and meadow (as it seemes) If that too much of these they doe containe, Is spent, is quench't, and drowned in excesse. [Continuall greefe and sorrow neuer wanteth] Continuall greefe and sorrow neuer wanteth, Where feeding hope continues, not decaying: But euermore despaire, that greefe recanteth, From former course of minde doth cause estraying. The glosse. Riuers arise and run into the seas, And waters without number day by day, And yet the same seeme neuer to decay, But new doe spring, and run and doe increase. So endlesse woes arise and multiplie, Redoubled one vpon anothers head: (For one in truth is with another fed) Still doe they come and yet they neuer die. For since their fertill rootes each moment planteth, Continuall greefe and sorrow neuer wanteth. Torments of minde and vilest miseries Are sworne to dwell within a haplesse soule, And there her ioies and pleasures doe controule, As to my selfe my sweete content denies: Then let not any Louer thinke to gaine The meanest thing, that liues in any hope, But liuing so, to fall into a scope, And wander in a world of greefe and paine: For miseries, men say, continue staying, Where feeding hope continues not decaying. Who knowes it not, Alas I knowe it well, That if a wofull soule is hoping still, She seldome doth enioy her mind and will, But that her hope must euer be her hell: So of this hope, that flatters me, I finde, And doe confesse, that with the same I liue, But still in feare, and therefore I would giue It for despaire, to ease my doubtfull minde: I wish not this false hope, my ioies that scanteth, But euermore despaire, that greefe recanteth. If any whit of goodnes euer came By vile despaire, it comes to me in prime: And it could neuer come in better time, Then to be hoping still to haue the same: The wisest and most prudent man at last, Wanting the good, that long he doth attend, (Which, nourished by hope, he did suspend) Seeing the time, that fed his hope, is past, And all his ioy, by hope that is decaying, From former course of minde doth cause estraying. [Faire Shepherdesse, I can no more] Faire Shepherdesse, I can no more, But faine I would Loue thee more, if that I could. [Of mine owne selfe I doe complaine] Firmius. Of mine owne selfe I doe complaine, And not for louing thee so much, But that indeede my power is such, That my true loue it doth restraine, And onely this doth giue me paine: For faine I would Loue her more, if that I could. Faustus. Thou dost deserue, who doth not see To be belou'd a great deale more: But yet thou shalt not finde such store Of loue in others as in mee: For all I haue I giue to thee. Yet faine I would Loue thee more, if that I could. Firmius. O trie no other Shepherd swaine, And care not other loues to prooue: Who though they giue thee all their loue, Thou canst not such as mine obtaine: And would'st thou haue in loue more gaine? O yet I would Loue thee more, if that I could. Faustus. Impossible it is (my friend) That any one should me excell In loue, whose loue I will refell, If that with me he will contend: My loue no equall hath, nor end. And yet I would Loue her more, if that I could. Firmius. Behold how loue my soule hath charm'd Since first thy beauties I did see, (Which is but little yet to mee) My freest senses I haue harm'd (To loue thee) leauing them vnarm'd: And yet I would Loue thee more, if that I could. Faustus. I euer gaue and giue thee still Such store of loue, as loue hath lent me: And therefore well thou maist content thee, That loue doth so enrich my fill: But now behold my chiefest will, That faine I would Loue thee more, if that I could. [Faustus in faith thou nill deserue] Faustus in faith thou nill deserue A Shepherds name, or keeping sheepe, Since thou so ill thy faith dost keepe. O that in passed time of late My selfe had past with that as fast, Then of this time I had no tast, Hauing enioyed so sweete a fate, Once was I in a happie state, Which want, mine eies in teares must steepe, Since thou so ill thy faith dost keepe. Ioyfull I was, and well content, Bicause I sawe (vnto my will) Thy loue so well thou didst fulfill, Which answer'd mine in sweete accent: But now I smell thy false intent, Which is, with suttletie becleepe, Since thou so ill thy faith dost keepe. Thy faith and more thy solemne othe Then to me firmely didst thou giue Not to forget me, while I liue: But now thou hast committed both Vnto the windes, that also loth Their little woorth abroad to sweepe, Since thou so ill thy faith dost keepe. If thou dost thinke that to beguile Her that doth loue, it is a glorie, Alas I cannot be but sorie: With thousand such thou maist defile Thy credit, and triumph each while Of all that heere doe feede their sheepe, Since thou so ill thy faith dost keepe. Behold my matchlesse loue most deere, And marke thy selfe, and who thou art, For if thou wilt, with guilefull hart Thou maist deceiue a thousand heere: Then greater doth my loue appeere, Then thy disloyaltie so deepe, Since thou so ill thy faith dost keepe. Musing I am, both night and day, And sundrie waies my fancies mooue, How that I might forget thy loue: And then vnto my selfe I say, That since thou dost me so betray, My loue shall in obliuion sleepe, Since thou so ill thy faith dost keepe. But at the time when I decree To practise it, then loue doth more Renew his forces then before: So that if loue aboundes in mee, And that the same doth want in thee, What shall I doe, shall not I weepe? When thou so ill thy faith dost keepe. A remedie, and very short In th' end to take I will not feare, Which shall be lesse for me to beare, Then thus to liue in such a sort, And death it is, mine onely port, To which my shiuer'd barke doth creepe, Since thou so ill thy faith dost keepe. [The rest is sweete to him that wearied is] The rest is sweete to him that wearied is, Succour and aide poore wretches wish for fast: The doome of death from him, that now is cast With fauour to reuoke, is thought a blisse: The shade in chiefest heate is not amisse, Pleasant of sheepe and Shepherdes to be past: The water ioies the meade, with drynesse waste: The frozen ground with ioy the sunne doth kisse: But yet the glorie, ioy, and sweete content, The wish of wishes, when the Shepherdesse Staies for her louer, these doe far exceede. Toong hold thy peace, and thought tell my intent, How great a lightening hope is in distresse Vnto the brest, that louing flames doth breede. [Now doe I knowe at last (though to my smart)] Now doe I knowe at last (though to my smart) How far the greefe of absence doth extend, But that this knowledge neuer any friend Of mine may learne, and wish with all my hart: Thus haue I liu'd deceiued with this art, Esteeming small of presence in the end: But woe is me that proofe doth now commend, And tels me cleere of this erronius part: Come Faustus then, with speede and stay no more, For staying woundes my soule and euery sense, Longer thy absence I cannot endure: Marke well what they were woont to say of yore, That by and by a hope, and confidence After an absence doth succeede most sure. [Faustus if thou wilt reade from me] Faustus if thou wilt reade from me These fewe and simple lines, By them most cleerely thou shalt see, How little should accounted bee Thy fained wordes and signes. For noting well thy deedes vnkinde, Shepherd, thou must not scan That euer it came to my minde, To praise thy faith like to the winde, Or for a constant man. For this in thee shall so be found, As smoke blowne in the aire, Or like quick siluer turning round, Or as a house built on the ground Of sandes that doe impaire. To firmenesse thou art contrarie, More slipp'rie then the Eele, Changing as weather-cocke on hie, Or the Camelion on the die, Or fortunes turning wheele. Who would beleeue thou wert so free, To blaze me thus each howre: My Shepherdesse, thou liu'st in mee, My soule doth onely dwell in thee, And euery vitall powre. Pale Atropos my vitall string Shall cut, and life offend, The streames shal first turne to their spring, The world shall end, and euery thing, Before my loue shall end. This loue that thou didst promise me Shepherd, where is it found? The word and faith I had of thee, O tell me now, where may they be, Or where may they resound? Too soone thou didst the title gaine Of giuer of vaine wordes, Too soone my loue thou didst obtaine, Too soone thou lou'st Diana in vaine, That naught but scornes affoordes. But one thing now I will thee tell, That much thy patience mooues: That, though Diana doth excell In beautie, yet she keepes not well Her faith, nor loyall prooues. Thou then hast chosen, each one saith, Thine equall and a shrowe, For if thou hast vndone thy faith, Her loue and louer she betraieth, So like to like will goe. If now this letter, which I send Will anger thee: Before Remember (Faustus yet my friend,) That if these speeches doe offend, Thy deedes doe hurt me more. Then let each one of vs amend, Thou deedes, I wordes so spent, For I confesse I blame my pen, Doe thou as much, so in the end Thy deedes thou doe repent. Faustus, it needes must be a woondrous case, And such a deede as one would not conceaue, A simple soule so slily to deceaue, Who quickly did thy faith and loue imbrace: Thy firmnesse she had tride a little space, And so she thought the same thou wouldst not leaue, Which made her still vnto thy liking cleaue, Bicause she thought it free from double face: If of this conquest (Shepherd) thou dost boast, With thousand such in time thou maist be crowned, If thousand times thou mean'st to vndermine, If high renowne is got for credit lost, Onely of me a subiect thou shalt finde With guiles to be a thousand times propouned. [I pray thee keepe my kine for mee] I pray thee keepe my kine for mee Carillio, wilt thou? Tell. First let me haue a kisse of thee, And I will keepe them well. If to my charge or them to keepe Thou dost commend thy kine, or sheepe, For this I doe suffice: Bicause in this I haue beene bred: But for so much as I haue fed, By viewing thee, mine eies, Command not me to keepe thy beast, Bicause my selfe I can keepe lest. How can I keepe, I pray thee tell, Thy kye, my selfe that cannot well Defend, nor please thy kinde, As long as I haue serued thee? But if thou wilt giue vnto mee A kisse to please my minde, I aske no more for all my paine, And I will keepe them very faine. For thee, the gift is not so great That I doe aske, to keepe thy neate, But vnto me it is A guerdon, that shall make me liue: Disdaine not then to lend, or giue So small a gift as this. But if to it thou canst not frame, Then giue me leaue to take the same. But if thou dost (my sweete) denie To recompence me by and by, Thy promise shall relent me, Heereafter some rewarde to finde: Behold how I doe please my minde, And fauours doe content me, That though thou speak'st it but in iest, I meane to take it at the best. Behold how much loue workes in mee, And how ill recompenc't of thee, That with the shadow of Thy happy fauours (though delaide) I thinke my selfe right well appaide, Although they prooue a scoffe. Then pitie me, that haue forgot My selfe for thee, that carest not. O in extreme thou art most faire, And in extreme vniust despaire Thy crueltie maintaines: O that thou wert so pitifull Vnto these torments that doe pull My soule with senselesse paines, As thou shew'st in that face of thine, Where pitie and milde grace should shine. If that thy faire and sweetest face Assureth me both peace and grace, Thy hard and cruell hart, Which in that white brest thou dost beare, Doth make me tremble yet for feare Thou wilt not end my smart: In contraries of such a kinde, Tell me what succour shall I finde? If then yoong Shepherdesse thou craue A herdsman for thy beast to haue, With grace thou maist restore Thy Shepherd from his barren loue: For neuer other shalt thou prooue, That seekes to please thee more, And who, to serue thy turne, will neuer shunne The nipping frost, and beames of parching sunne.

[Let the silence of the night] Let the silence of the night At my will her dutie showe: Harken to me euery Wight, Or be still, or speake but lowe: Let no watching dog with spight Barke at any to or fro, Nor the Cocke (of Titan bright The foreteller) once to crowe. Let no prying goose excite All the flocke to squeake a rowe: Let the windes retaine their might, Or a little while not blowe: Whilst thy eare I doe inuite On this ditty to beslowe. In the which I will recite Thy deserts, which euer growe: Nor thy beauties so bedight, Fairer then the rose or snowe. Nor how with thy grace (of right) Thou dost conquer others soe: Nor thy vertues exquisite, Which no wight deserues to knowe. For into seas infinite With small barke it were to goe, And that labyrinth sans light, Wherein Theseus they did throwe. I not hauing in this plight Threed as he (his guide from woe) I will onely sing and write How in happines I flowe, That thy seruant I doe hight, Praising Fortune and Loues bowe: Thanking him, that so did smite: She, bicause she was not slowe In her throne my paines to quite: Loue, for (like a friendly foe) Wounding thee with golden flight: And for shooting many moe Into my soule, whose paines shal seeme but slight, If with thy grace their wo?ds thou wilt requite. [He that doth Fortune blame] He that doth Fortune blame, And of God Cupid speaketh ill. Full little knowes he that his will Is subiect to the same: And that he doth procure his proper shame, Held for a foole, and one of simple skill. Who speakes he knowes not what, Is thought to be a very Sot: For good of them who speaketh not? And I suspect that that Same simple one, doth lay a formall plat To be reputed for an idiot. He knowes not Fortunes might, Nor knowes the mightie God of Loue: She rules beneath, and he aboue; For she doth sit by right Amongst the Goddesses with shining light; And he amongst the Gods his might doth prooue. The Boy I will omit, Since that his great and mighty name Giues him great praise and woorthy fame, Being (who knowes not it) The God of Loue, whose praise I will forgit, To sing of Fortune that most noble dame. The foole on Fortune railes, Bicause she neuer doth repose, The first and highest sphere, and those Adioyning, neuer failes In that, which all the world so much auailes, I meane in motions which they neuer lose. In their perpetuall course. Their essence and foundation lies, And in their motions neuer dies: Our life from them their source Doth take, and vnto death should haue recourse, And cease, if they should cease to mooue the skies. They vse to paint her blinde, Bicause the highest, and the lowe She reares, and after downe doth throwe, Respecting not the kinde Of persons, nor the merits of the minde: The King she doth not from the Collier knowe. Fortune heerein they take For a great Goddesse (and with right) For Goddesses doe not requite With partiall hand, and makes No difference of persons for their sakes, And partially doe neuer vse their might. They call her also mad, Bicause her works they doe not knowe, Nor any path, where she doth goe, But all her waies so bad: That to exempt themselues they would be glad From them, for feare of their ensuing woe. But such are made indeede, That make a reason so vnfit, For when did euer humane wit Knowe what the Gods decreed? Or how they meant with power to proceede, Or their intents? which men could neuer hit. It fitteth not my song To deigne to answere with direction Men of such wit and small perfection: That offer her such wrong; For Fortune doth onely to those belong That haue the vse of reason and election. The Ancient otherwise Did thinke, for they did make of her A Goddesse, and they did not erre: To whom sweete sacrifice, And temples in her name they did deuise: As in their bookes they doe no lesse auerre. [All you that haue vnwoorthily complained] All you that haue vnwoorthily complained Of Loue, and Fortune, each a mighty powre: On Time, that doth your sweete contents deuowre Turne them: For more heereby is to be gained. For time is false: For if content vnfained It giueth thee, I passeth in an howre; But still it staies if it begins to lowre. It comes not wisht for, nor doth stay obtained: Time hath no friend in any thing created, For euery thing it wasteth and consumeth, And doth not spare so much as any body &amp;c. [It fitteth not my song] It fitteth not my song To deigne to answer with direction Men of such wit and small perfection, That offer her such wrong: For Fortune doth onely to those belong That haue the vse of reason and election. The end of the seuenth booke. The eight Booke of the second Part of Diana of George of Montemayor. Disteus his letter to Dardanea. To thee the comfort of all mortall men, Of all men liuing the most comfortlesse, Health (if discomfort any such can send) If any left, doth send with happinesse. I wish no ease of all my ceaselesse paine, If that a thousand times when I did take In hand to write to thee, I left againe My pen as oft, when hand and hart did quake. I launch't into the maine and broadest seas, Knowing no port, nor friendly land, or coast To saile vnto (my shaken barke to ease, With raging waues and furious tempests tost) For on the one side if I thought to write, To make thee knowe my paine which thou hast wrought: Thy high desertes on th' other came in sight, To beate downe such a far vnwoorthy thought. My wearied torments did commaund an I, Thy soueraine highnes did forbid a No, And that commaund with reason did denie, Such woorthinesse and glorie it did showe. But after this proud boldnes came in place, Perswading me I should doe well before To write to thee: But feare did him disgrace, And said I should but anger thee the more. And therefore now as feare did ouercome Braue boldnes, and had throwne it to the ground, And now that all my senses waxed numme By feare, which did my feeble hope confound. Couragiously the God of Loue came in, And said, vnwoorthy feare packe hence, away: And come no more, for now thou shalt not win: I doe commaund, Loue doth commaund I say. And turning to me in this sort he saide, As by commaund, nor gently by request, The fire (when once it is in flames displaide) Hides not it selfe, but makes it manifest: Euen so it is impossible to hide My firie flames, from being sometimes knowne, And though I would not, yet on euery side They issue out, that easily they are knowne. Since then thy Nymph celestiall must knowe, Either too soone or late thy cruell flame, Let first thy mouth declare to her thy woe, Then to thy hand and pen commend the same. I answered (God wot with fainting hart) To write to her, it is my chiefe desire; But if she chaunce to frowne at this bold part, O God defend my pen should cause her ire. Thus Loue at last perceiuing what a faint And hartlesse coward I was, in the end He wrote to thee, by pitying of my plaint, And in my name Loue doth this letter send. And now bicause thy minde it may not mooue To anger, by receiuing of the same: And if thou think'st thy honour I doe prooue, Knowe from a God, and from no man it came. Euen from the God of Loue, who is a God Of highest birth, whose power doth extend In heauen, and earth, where he makes his abode, Both paying tribute to him without end. So that it is the mighty God of Loue That erres (if that in writing he doth erre) Against Loue therefore all thy anger mooue, (If this to wrath thy modest minde may stirre.) Harke well (my deerest Mistresse) what I say, That if this letter breedeth thy offence, Be thou reueng'd of Loue, which did assay To write, and not of me for this pretence. But by the way I tell thee as a friend, That if with Loue thou dost begin to striue, With nature and her lawes thou dost contend, For making thee the fairest one aliue. For if she haue of purpose giuen thee Beautie, and grace, and in thy brest hath fram'd The onely patterne of gentilitie, That beauties Paragon thou maist be nam'd. And to lay vp her riches all in one, Of all her treasure she hath now despoild The world, and made it poore in leauing none, And to make thee the onely one hath toild. Hath she not reason then to be offended, If by the gemme, where she her vtmost tride, She would haue seene and knowne how far extended Her passing skill, which thou dost seeke to hide? Hath she not reason to be angrie, when The patterne of her skill and onely one Hides from the world and buries in a den Her treasures, which so faine she would haue knowne? For sure I knowe, if that thou meanest not To loue, thou buriest all her partes in thee: And dost thou thinke, that anything is got By flying Loue, and natures best decree? And if thou think'st heerein to doe amisse, Or hurt thy selfe by louing, yet at lest Suffer thy selfe to be belou'd. And this Fond error driue out of thy tender brest. O suffer of thine owne accord and will, For forced thou shalt be to this for euer: While thou and I doe liue, and shalt be still After thy death and mine, and ended neuer. Then will me not (Dardanea) to forsake My perfect loue, which now I haue bewraied: For more thou dost commaund the lesse I make Account of it, and lesse shalt be obaied. And thinke thou art not wronged any whit, Bicause what thou (faire Mistresse) dost commaund Is not obaide, for heere it is not fit Where life for loue and loue for life is pawn'd. Leaue thou if that thou canst the same thou hast, Yeelding to nature, what so much on thee She hath bestowde, and change thy life that's past, And leaue moreouer what thou mean'st to be. Then shalt thou see thy most vniust desire Fulfill'd, and will perform'd without defect, Although thou didst the contrarie require, As fearing colours with some vaine suspect. But now why should'st thou leaue a perfect being, By taking that which more imperfect is? As first mens eies the like was neuer seeing, The second voide of comfort, ioy and blisse. So that (sweete Mistresse) it becomes thee not To anger Loue, and Nature to offend, For thou art bound (whom they haue not forgot) Their lawes to loue, their essence to defend. Since that thy beauties in the world resound, And dost in vertue hold the highest place, And dost in knowledge and in wit abound, In modestie, and euery other grace: Make them illustrous then by thy requiting, Take heede, Ingratitude is full of hate, Hate to reuenge is euer more inuiting, And so reuenge waites at obliuions gate. And thinke not, that I speake these wordes in iest, For to a cruell Goddesse it belongs This vice (which all the world doth so detest) To punish, and torment ingratefull wrongs. And Nemesis the angrie is her name, Whose vnresisted might who doth not knowe? Equall she is and neuer but the same, Impartially to deale with friend or foe. Alas I would she might not finde in thee So great a fault, as none more great then this, Since from all other faultes thou shalt be free, If but this fault alone thou wilt dismisse. But thou maist say, why should thy haplesse fare Trouble my minde, or thy good please my will, Or what haue I to doe to take such care, Whether thy fortune fall out good or ill? To answere this, I cannot well replie, Let it suffice thee, that the lest suspect Of any harme thou hast doth make me die, And worse then death torments me in effect. Deere Lady, then I would not haue thee prooue The cruell shaft of angrie Nemesis: For first let each infernall power mooue Their plagues against me of eternall Dis. But now I would be glad if thou wouldst tast The sweete and golden flight of Cupids poure, Bicause my torments, which are gone and past, Pitie thou might'st and those I feele this howre. For if thou knew'st my paines and pitious case, With pitie and teares thou wouldst my life deplore, Not for my merits, which are very base, But for my loue, which well deserueth more. Each thing that is created heere so fit, An equall hauing in a diuers kinde, In such like kinde a paiment doth admit, By measuring the debt that is behinde, But as fell loue no equall doth containe, In such a diuers kinde and different, By selfe same thing it paies it selfe againe: Loue must be paid with loue of good intent. Then since it is most euident and cleere, That I doe prize thy loue at such a rate, Thou must requite my loue againe so deere, If Nemesis ingratitude doth hate. But if thou dost not purpose to requite The loue, that I haue borne, and beare thee still; And with like loue to ease my heauie plight, And greeuous paines for thy procuring ill: My hands of life shall then vndoe the chaine, But not of loue (by death to ease my death) And so requite me, when no other meane Is left, to make me still enioy this breath. For sure if that my life be of this sort, My life is death, and dying is my life: My death is sweete, a pleasure, ioy and sport, Liuing in such a world of amorous strife. But now I cease, my teares fall in such store, And painfull soule for greefe can write no more. Dardaneas answere to Disteus. To thee the most presumptuous without leaue, Counsell, not health, by these few lines I send, That am more fearfull then thou maist conceaue: If that I thought mine honour to offend By answering thee, constraind as thou maist see, Or answering not, it might the more extend, Rather then I would thus much pleasure thee, Or would vouchsafe to take my pen in hand, First would I take a sword to murder me. Mine end is good, and doth with vertue stand, And if thou dost thinke otherwise then so, Thou art deceiu'd as much as any man: For if my reason soundly thou wilt knowe, And weigh my wordes but with attentiue minde, And note each sentence that heerein I showe: By all the foresaid thou shalt onely finde, How I pretend to giue thee sound aduise, And holesome counsell fit for one so blinde: Which is, that thou leaue of this enterprise (If that thou canst) and flie a thought so vaine, Or at the least conceale it from mine eies. I knowe not, and the ground cannot obtaine, That made thee write to me this other day: Nor yet from whence such boldnes thou might'st gaine. But now I doe remember thou didst say, That loue not thou, those louing lines did write, Bicause it did thy minde too much dismay: Fancies they are, like to the dreames by night, Common to louers (if there any bee) To manifest his childish toies so light. Poore God of loue, thy seruants all agree As many as doe waite vpon thy traine, To lay their faultes most commonly in thee: If childish toies I saide: doe not disdaine: For this God, whom thou dost so much obay, Is but a childe, thy wordes doe shew it plaine. Thou seem'st to shew the same by wordes, I say, By deedes I knowe not, nor I doe pretend To knowe, though deedes by words thou dost display. Which last of all in men I comprehend, Which are more wordes then works in plaine effect: In case this God of loue their mindes offend, If that your harts so plainly could detect That, which your mouth expresseth by her voice, We should not hold your loues in such suspect. But truth it is, I doe no whit reioice, For nothing it concerneth me at all, To heare thee vaunt thee of thy loue and choice: And that as firme as any brazen wall, And more then rocks vpon the shorie sandes, In fortunes fauour or in fortunes thrall: That like an Oke against the winde it standes, Like hardest Dimond to the beating steele, Like Salamander in the flaming brandes. And that againe it turneth like the wheele, And wauers more then beames of shaken glasse, More then the waues, that tumble still and reele, More changing then the weathercocke (Alas) In towres, and more then Cynthia in her skie: And more then men in loue their liues that passe. This hurts me little, nor I care not I, Wherefore it shall be better for thy ease, Not to loue her, that doth thy loue denie. Then seeke some other with thy loue to please Against thy loue that will not so rebell, And where thou maist swim in contented seas: For (sooth) thy person hath deserued well To be beloued of some other dame, For many giftes in which thou dost excell. There is no Lady, but would wish the same, Nor scorne thy loue, but euer thinke her blest That she might call thee by her louers name. And sooner shalt thou want (to match thy brest) A Lady fit (respecting thy desert) For none come neere (though yet accounted best) Of purpose heere thy praises I insert, For thou didst so much wander in my praise, That onely this for thanks I doe reuert. And wordes for wordes doe giue thee now in paise, And if thou hast extolled me much better, So all thy giftes in euerie place I blaze, Ingratefull thou didst call me in thy letter, And there the proofe was false and very vaine, And therefore thou must yet remaine my detter. Although it were not so, thou saidst againe That I was bound to loue, in being faire, So worldling like thine argument was plaine. But see how reason doth the same impaire, For brighter doth each womans beautie shine, The more she shines in praise of vertues rare. So that I shall make nature more diuine, In following Dianas honest traine, Then Venus steps, or her fond discipline. To please her sonne I euer thought it vaine, Since him I cannot, and Diana please, For she is chast, dishonest is his chaine. To serue Apollos sister, sweetest ease And greatest honour by her loue is got. Who serues fond loue is drown'd in dolefull seas. If after Venus sonne thou art so hot, And dost intend to follow his desires, If so it please, then how maiest thou not? I doe not meane to loue what he requires: And let this God euen worke with me his fill, He neuer shall consume me in his fires. Let him not seeke but her, that seekes her ill, Let him not wound but those that loue his wounds, Nor subiect those that care not for his will. But now I knowe not to what purpose soundes These reasons, that disswade me to imbrace Cupid thy God, that reason still confoundes. Since that vnto my will he giueth place, And on the same his liking doth depend, Reason in me his colours doe deface. T'is therefore reason, to the which I tend, And great it is, since it doth satisfie My minde, and doth the same so well defend. Thou writ'st, that if to loue thee I denie, That I would suffer thee to loue me yet, Against my will for loue yet wilt thou die. A pretie meanes procoeding from thy wit, To pray me not thy deere loue to preuent, Yet will I nill I thou to practise it. I greeue I cannot hinder this intent, But if (in fine) perforce vnto my paine Thou wilt loue me, perforce I must consent. If that from being lou'd, I could remaine, (As from all loue) in faith I neuer would Haue left it to thy choosing to abstaine. For he that lou'd me with such rigour should Be punish't, that he should haue thence no soule To loue me, if his loue preuent I could. But Ile doe that which no man shall controule, Which is that none presume to manifest His loue to me so wanton and so bolde. Let therefore punishment thy minde suggest, To mooue this fancie from thy idle minde, A fancie first conceiu'd within thy brest, Of no good ground where hope thou canst not finde: Hope is exil'd where honour taketh place; Honour is deere to women of my kinde: Virgins I meane, and liuing in the face Of all the world with honour and renowne. Which if it be but staind, each other grace She hath, with no recou'rie falleth downe. If then these few perswasions cannot make Thee change thy minde, nor now this present frowne, Nor trembling hands, which now for anger shake By writing of these lines with little rest, Nor feare of punishment make thee forsake This fond conceit nurc'd vainly in thy brest, When thou maist neuer hope to haue a day; Then let mine honour mooue thee (at the lest) To make thee hide this fier (if you may) Wherewith thou saist thy brest is so inflam'd: Marke this, and let thy wits not so estray. If that thou saist, that hardly is reclam'd The fire of loue, and hardly hid againe; To tell it Palna lesse thou shalt be blam'd. But since thy hope incertaine is and vaine, And all thy harmes most sure, then ope the dore (To helpe thee) to obliuion and disdaine. And thus I end in hope to heare no more. Whosoever therefore is desirous to see the funerall of Delius, the riualitie of Syrenius, Firmius, and Faustus, and be at all their meetings, and takes any pleasure to know who Stela is, and would faine knowe what her troubles, and those of Crimine, Delicius and Parthenius, haue beene, and to what ende they came, as also the loue of Agenestor, prince of Eolia and of Lustea daughter to Disteus and Dardanea, let him attende me in the third part of this work, which shall come to light out of hande.

      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST PART OF ENAMOVRED DIANA, made by Gaspar Gil Polo. To the most noble and vertuous Lady. Doña Maria de Austria y fuentes. The first Booke of Enamoured Diana. [Long haue I felt a silent paine of sorrow] Long haue I felt a silent paine of sorrow, Cruell, by that my senses it importunes To such extremes, that I am forc't to borrow This last releefe against my heauie fortunes, To publish them vnto the windes, that stay them Thorow out the world with pitie to conuay them. Then gentle Aire, performe this due of pitie, Let euery region know my greeuous anguish, Breath out my paines, and tell in euery citie The life of her, that in Loues want doth languish: Forgotten of a Shepherd that disdaines her, Who once did die euen for like loue that paines her. O that this all (death to my vitall powers) Hardly maintain'd amids these cruell fashions, Springs of my late obliuion and those howers, Which I bestow'd, and thought not of his passions: And that the fault, that heertofore did blame me. Causeth my paine, and with my paine doth shame me. Hart breake in two for greefe when thought assailes thee Of those fell torments which thou once didst lend him, Thou lou'st him now, but little it preuailes thee To pardon that, wherewith thou didst offend him. Who cried once for that which now I crie for, And died once for that which now I die for. These present greefes of passions that confound me With ceaselesse paine, torment not in such measure, As thoughts of my late crueltie doe wound me, Or when I thinke, I lost so deere a treasure: For they are heauen, to thinke that now I prize him, And these are hell, to thinke I did despise him. For if my little loue (more fitly named Iniurious hate) (whereof I now repent me) Were not in fault (alas too lately blamed) Of all these present greefes, that thus torment me; Then with complaints I would not cease t'importune Vngentle loue, and raile on cruell Fortune. But I so proude for my admired beautie That flattred me, of sense was so bereaued, That carelesse of my fault, and forced dutie I owde to Loue, I neuer once perceaued, That Loue did take reuengement at his pleasure, And Fortune change without all meane or measure. But Loues reuenge wrought neuer such a woonder, Nor to so great despaire did euer driue one, As thus on euery side to breake a sunder, And ruinate a hope that might reuiue one: And Fortune in her change made neuer any So great, as from one life to deathes so many. Syrenus then, how art thou now assured Of thy reuenge, which thou hast deepely taken In my disgrace, which I my selfe procured: That since of late my loue thou hast forsaken, No remedie for any greefe is left me, That of my woonted comfort hath bereft me. For heeretofore as thou hast euen, and morrow, Seene me disdaine thy sight with so small reason, So maist thou now take pleasure in my sorrow, And with thy scornes my feeble comforts season: For now to loue me, lies not in thy power, Though I must loue thee till my dying hower. So far from Cupids force thy haps haue blest thee, And in thy libertie thou tak'st such glorie, That (gentle Shepherd) I doe not request thee To cure mine ill (which cannot make thee sorie) But to beguile these paines by Loue ordained, With one poore fauour, though it were but fained: And though mine ils, which thou art not contented To remedie, nor dost pretend to cease them, When to thy carelesse thoughts they are presented, Whose hot reuenge haue vowed to increase them: Yet turne thine eies, and see how mine are flowing With riuolets of teares, that still are growing. Behold my ruine, and my life decaied, My little hope, which in despaire I borrow, My teares, my sighes, my senses all dismaied, Though not to take compassion of my sorrow, Yet see how with them all I am affreighted, In thy reuenge to be the more delighted. For though with greefe, wherewith I still am calling To mollifie thy hart, and haue no power, Nor that my teares, which euermore are falling, Cannot excuse my death one little hower, Then will I die for loue of thee and neuer Enioy this breath without I loue thee euer. [That mighty Loue, though blinde of both his eies] That mighty Loue, though blinde of both his eies, Doth hit the Center of the wounded hart: And though a boy yet Mars he foiles with dart, Awaking him, where in his net he lies: And that his flames doe freeze me in such wise, That from my soule a feare doth neuer start Most base and vile: yet to the highest part (Strengthned by land and sea) of heauen it flies. That he, whom Loue doth wound or prisoner take, Liues in his greefes, and with his giues content: This is his might that many woonder at. And that the soule which greatest paine doth shake, If that it doth but thinke of Loues torment, The feare of such a thought forgetteth that. [Loue is not blinde, but I, which fondly guide] Loue is not blinde, but I, which fondly guide My will to tread the path of amorous paine: Loue is no childe, but I, which all in vaine, Hope, feare, and laugh, and weepe on euery side: Madnes to say, that flames are Cupids pride, For my desire his fier doth containe, His wings my thoughts most high and soueraine, And that vaine hope, wherein my ioies abide: Loue hath no chaines nor shaftes of such intent, To take and wound the whole and freest minde, Whose power (then we giue him) is no more, For loue's a tale, that Poets did inuent, A dreame of fooles, an idoll vaine and blinde: See then how blacke a God doe we adore? [He that in freedome iets it proude and braue] He that in freedome iets it proude and braue, Let him not liue too carelesse of himselfe: For in an instant he may be a slaue To mighty Loue, and serue that wanton elfe: And let that hart, that yet was neuer tamed, Feare at the last by him to be inflamed. For on that soule that proudly doth disdaine His heauie lawes, and liues with loftie will, Fierce Loue is woont t'inflict a cruell paine, And with most sharpe and dire reuenge to kill: That who presumes to liue without his power, In death he liues tormented euery hower. O Loue, that dost condemne me to thy iaile, Loue, that dost set such mortall coles on fire, O Loue, that thus my life thou dost assaile, Intreated ill, tormented by thine ire: Hencefoorth I curse thy chaines, thy flames, thy dart, Wherewith thou bind'st, consum'st, and kill'st my hart. Prouencall Rythmes. Alcida. While Titan in his Coach with burning beames Ouer the world with such great force doth ride, That Nymphes, and their chaste companies abide In woods, and springs, and shallowe shadowed streames: And while the prating grashopper replies Her song in mourning wise, Shepherdesse sing So sweete a thing, That th' heauens may bee By hearing thee Made gentle, on their owne accord to power Vpon this meade a fresh and siluer shower. Diana. Whiles that the greatest of the Planets staies Iust in the mids betweene the East and west, And in the field vpon the mowers brest With greater heate doth spread his scorching raies: The silent noise this pleasant fountaine yeeldes, That runs amids these fieldes, Such musicke mooues, As woonder prooues, And makes so kinde The furious winde, That by delight thereof, their force they stay, And come to blowe as gently as they may. Alcida. You running riuers pure and christalline, That all the yeere doe make a liuely spring, And beautifie your banks and euery thing, With Cowslips, Lillies, and sweete Colombine, The cruell heate of Phœbus come not neere To beate this fountaine cleere, Nor that such sweete Liquour, with feete Troubled be not Of sheepe or goat: Nor that the teares, which faithlesse iouers wast In these fine waters neuer may be cast. Diana. Greene flowrie meade, where natures curious die Hath showen her colours diuers in their kinde, With trees, and flowers, whereto they are combinde, Which paintes thee foorth so faire vnto the eie: In thee thy boughes of verdure may not knowe The blustring windes that blowe, Prosper, and giue Flowers, and liue: Not to be lost By heate or frost: Nor angrie heauen in furie doe not stoile, Nor hurt so faire a meade, and fertill soile. Alcida. Heere from the hurly burly, and the noise Of stately courtes sequestred, euery one Reposedly liues by himselfe alone, In quiet peace, in harmlesse sportes and ioies: In shades sometimes, laide downe on Floras pride Neere to some riuers side, Where birdes doe yeeld Sweete notes in field, And flowers fine Odours diuine: And alwaies with an order soueraine The meadow laughes, the wood, the hill, and plaine. Diana. The noise made heere by silent gentle windes In flowrie boughes, the leaues that softly shake, Delighteth more, then that the people make In great assemblies, where their sundrie kindes Of proud demeanours, and high maiesties, Are foolish vanities: Their solemne feastes Breede but vnrestes, Their honours name Blinde errours frame: And all their holy wordes cleane different From that, that in their harts was euer ment. Alcida. Ambition heere no snares nor nets regardes, Nor auarice for crownes doth lay her bates: The people heere aspire not to estates, Nor hungers after fauours, nor rewardes: From guile and fraude, and passion, as we see, Their harts are euer free. Their faith's not vaine, But good and plaine: Their malice small, They iust to all, Which makes them liue in ioy and quiet peace, And in a meane sufficient for their ease. Diana. To new found worlds, nor seas, that rage and swell, The simple Shepherd neuer sailes in vaine: Nor to the furdest Indias, for his gaine, Thousandes of leagues, and duckates there to tell: Vnto the field he comes as well content, With that that God hath sent; As he that spendes Rents without endes: And liues (perdie) As merily As he that hath great flockes vpon his hils, And of good ground a thousand acres tils. [I cannot be by Loues wrath more tormented] I cannot be by Loues wrath more tormented, Nor Fortune can to me be more vnstable: There is no soule in hope so little able, Nor hart that is with paine so much contented: Loue doth inforce my fainting breath, that striueth The better to endure my hard reiection, And yet with hope my suffrance, and affection, And life will not consume, that yet reuiueth: O vainest hart, sad eies, whose teares haue spent me, Why in so long a time, and with such anguish, End not my plaints, and spirits deadly languish? O woes, sufficeth it not what you haue sent me? O Loue, why dost thou thus my torments nourish, And let Alcida in her freedome flourish? Marcelius his letter to Alcida. That maiestie so princely, graue, and sweete, That modest blush, that gentle seemely grace, Those lookes so chaste, and hauiour so discreete, Those golden vertues, that thou dost imbrace (Besides thy beautie, which the world resoundes With famous name) from heauen that brought their race, In such a narrow streight, with bleeding woundes Haue set my hart (Alcida heauenly faire) That euery thing my woonted rest confoundes; For that which breedes my loue, is my despaire, And so restraines my soule, that faine it would Say nought, although it cost my vitall aire. What man of flint, that euer did behold The burning beames that thy faire eies doe cast, But waxed dumbe, and died with mortall cold? Who euer sawe those beauties rare and chaste, More perfect then the starrie skie aboue, Or any liuing now or gone or past, That presently felt not a feruent loue? The cause whereof his senses so would vse, As not to let him speake for his behoue: So much I passe by silence, that I muse That sad complaintes my hart doe neuer kill, Nor breake my brest with anguish so confuse: My ioies are none, my woes continue still, My paine is firme, and all my hope is vaine, I liue alas, and die in greeuous ill: And take reuenge vpon my selfe againe, That which I most eschew, doth take me straight: And what I most desire, I lest obtaine: For that, that lest behooues me, I awaite, Not comfort for my greefe, that neuer endes, Ioying in paine, wherewith my soule I fraight: Yet my delight and life so far extendes, As thought of that great distance doth abide, That twixt thy beautie, grace, and me dependes: For in my soule I doe conceiue a pride, That I haue put it in so high a place: Where constancie and hope my hart doe guide. But yet thy gentle, and sweete Angels face Against my soule such mortall war doe threate, That thousand liues dare not abide the chace. To feare me yet the passage's not so great, Nor way so steepe, nor craggie, that shall stay My forward steps with danger, or deceate: I follow then my ruine and decay, The path of paine, and seeke not to decline From greeuous plaints, that force me eueryday. Yet endlesse ioy my heauie hart doth shrine, And glads my life, by wished paine opprest: That glories strangely in these greefes of mine. Paine's my delight, my plaints my sport and iest, My sighes sweete soundes, my death my glory makes, My woundes my health, my flames my happy rest, Nothing I see, which stirs not, and awakes My furious torment and her endlesse wheele; But happy fortune by the same it takes: These ils (sweete Mistresse) for thy sake I feele, And in these passions liue, and die tormented With equall paine, and suffrance, well contented. Let then a man despairing of releefe, Who to thy loue his doubtfull life assignes, Mooue thee to some compassion of his greefe, By reading of these hart-breake written lines, Since that he craues no helpe for all his mone, But onely that his torment may be knowne. [O Sandie desart and drie barren meade] O Sandie desart and drie barren meade, Thou that hast heard the sound of my lament, O swelling seas fierce winde to changing bent, Chang'd with my sighes, that are in sorrow bread Hard recke, wherein for euer may be read My torment heerein grauen, and permanent: Truly report my paines which you present. For that Marcelius heere hath left me dead, My sister stolne, he hath forgotten mee His faith, his sailes, and then my hope forlorne Commend I to the windes, and witnes yee That loue I will not any man that's borne, To scape those seas where calmes are neuer any, Nor combat foes, that are so fierce and many. [Now that the sunne doth hide his golden beames] Taurisus. Now that the sunne doth hide his golden beames Behinde the hils, whose shadowes doe increase: And labouring men vnyoke their wearie teames And leaue of worke, their wearied lims to ease: My sheepe forsake your pastures, and attend Vnto my fainting voice and hollow cries, Which without stint or pause of time, I send Disorderly vnto the carelesse skies: Harke how my poore and miserable hart Is in the deepest of a burning flame, And how my bowels and euery inward part Are melted with the scorching of the same: That flame I meane and heate, wherewith my sencelesse soule doth trace Th' Angelicall and peerelesse beautie of Dianas face. Berardus. Before the sunne in radiant Coche doth glide Downe to the West, to leaue our Hemisphere, And suffers not the deaw of euening tide To fall vpon the meadowes any where, Thou simple Sheepe that oft hast heard my voice, And gentle lambes which all the sommer long With merrie glee doe in these meades reioice, Now lend a gentle eare vnto my song: My ruthfull song and verse shall not intreate (Though all the same within my brest I beare) Of any flames, or coles, or burning heate: But of that mortall cold and frozen feare, Wherewith doth bridle and correct the sencelesse soule apace Th' Angelicall and peerelesse beautie of Dianas face. Taurisus. When that my painefull thoughts and pensiue minde Doe but imagine of her comely graces, Then burnes my soule so strangely, that I finde My vitall spirits to leaue their proper places: Loue doth inforce this suffrance, weake by kinde, And hope, that's flowne away with feathered paces, To make my flames still burning in my brest, Which giues me not one hower of wished rest. Berardus. When I consider of my base estate, And high perfections of my Shepherdesse, Then doth my hart retire with fearefull gate, And pinching frost my timorous soule possesse: Loue will I liue in hope of happinesse, And so I doe sometimes, but fortunes hate To quaking feare subiecteth euery power, Which makes me not enioy one happy hower. Taurisus. In such ill time, I sawe the burning light Of those cleere stars, whose like was neuer seene, That face, that grace, those vertues infinite, With which Diana raignes as fairest Queene: That my desires are kindled by those bright And shining beames, that I doe neuer weene To hope for ease of these excessiue flames That burnes my soule, and breedes a thousand blames. Berardus. In such ill time I sawe those daintie handes Of whitest Iuorie, fram'd for thousand smartes, And those two eies, where little Cupid standes Wounding the freest mindes with mortall dartes: That my small forces with his mighty bandes Confounded, foiled, and fearfully departes, And then remaines so weakned with his ire, That shiuering feare doth conquer my desire. Taurisus. Didst euer see a lightning from the skies With mightie force to rend an aged Oke? So strong is that and terrible, which lies Within my brest, all smoothered in the smoke: Didst euer see the violent force of brookes, That from the highest rocks fall headlong downe? So proud, so fierce, and angrie in her lookes Diana seemes, when she begins to frowne: But her pretences are too far To make me sad by base and seruile feare, For greater that the dangers are, The greater is the firmenes which I beare. Berardus. Didst euer see the snowe in any hill To lie, and melt before the sunnie beames? So doe I waste with sighes and teares distill Before those lights that from her beautie streames: Didst euer see in any bloodie broile Some simple Shepherd put to fearefull flight? With no lesse feare (poore man) I doe recoile, Leauing my sheepe (whilome my best delight) And in this cold and frozen feare I merit more, and in my trembling brest More comfort and content doe beare, Then in that heate so bold and manifest. Taurisus. My greefe (Berardus) which I feele, is of such suttell Art, That it doth trouble still my soule and euery part consume Thereof, which neuer to resist, durst once presume for feare, But euen as gently as it may, and must with meare consent Yeeld vp her life into the hands of him that's bent to tame The proudest harts: And ioyfull in his burning flame I liue: And as they doe of comfort giue me store For more content, so would I wish for more. Berardus. The Gods (Taurisus) and the heauens haue made so passing faire This star Diana, whose golden gleames of glittring haire and face Doe with their lights illuminate my life, and chace away The darkest cloudes, restoring to mine eies a day so bright, That if I am beholding her the shining light and blaze Of those two stars, mine eies and senses doe amaze and blinde, That casting them vnto the ground, my hopes I finde so bare, That, though I would, not once I dare complaine Or see, or sue, or tell her of my paine. Taurisus. This louely Nymph would neuer list Vnto my wofull cries, But in her rigour doth persist And from my succour flies: And pitilesse to see my death would neuer turne her eies. O cruell eies, O cruell paine, O beautie, cruell foe: Yet doth my faith so firme remaine, That all my cares and woe It doth encourage in such sort, and feares doth ouerthrowe, That like a sturdie rocke it standes Against the cruell raues (Though fencelesse in the naked sandes) Of beating windes and waues. And how much more with conquering hand my hart she doth controule, By so much doe I adde more heate vnto my burning soule. Berardus. The woods and mountaines doe not beare Woolues of such crueltie; Whose howling threats I feare not theare, And yet aiealousie Doth make my hart to quake for feare, And yeeld most cowardly. I am not able to defend My weake and feeble brest From thousand feares, where they pretend To build their strongest nest: And with their entrance driue away my hopes, my ioy and rest. There they commaund and gouerne all, And proudly tyrannize, And there my soule to endlesse thrall And bodie sacrifice. O cruell Loue, whom cruell death must needes at last succeede, O why with such consuming tortures die I not in deede? Taurisus. Neere to this Christall fountaine on a day I sawe Diana sitting with her spouse, And as by chaunce I crost the woods that way, Espied them behinde these hasell bowes: Dying with greefe impatience, and despite To see (which I would not haue seene) that sight. Nothing he spake, but with his clownish hand Did rudely touch, and claspe her round about: (Her tender corpes, the smallest in this land, Too daintie and fine for such a homely lout.) And so he sat, and did not stir In this vnseemely sort with her. But when my iealous eies so base a thing espied With mortall rage I burn'd and cruell enuie died. Berardus. To walke the woods in sweetest moneth of May When winter hides his hoarie head for shame, Diana with her husband on a day The glorie of the farest women came. A vaile of Lawne vpon her golden haire With siluer pins enfolded euery where, A thousand sportes and pastimes did I see How she found out, his minde to recreate: And as I lurk'd behinde a Poplar tree, How louingly she dallied with her mate: Whom I did see reach foorth his hand Vnto her necke as white as swan, Wherewith he did vndoe her vaile and loose her shining haire, Which sight did kill my hart with feare enwrapped in despaire. [The cause why that thou dost denie] Taurisus. The cause why that thou dost denie To looke on me, sweete foe impart? Diana. Bicause that doth not please the eie, Which doth offend and greeue the hart. Taurisus. What woman is, or euer was, That when she looketh, could be mou'd? Diana. She that resolues her life to passe, Neither to loue nor to be lou'd. Taurisus. There is no hart so fierce nor hard, That can so much torment a soule. Diana. Nor Shepherd of so small regard, That reason will so much controule. Taurisus. How fals it out Loue doth not kill Thy crueltie with some remorce? Diana. Bicause that Loue is but a will, And free will doth admit no force. Taurisus. Behold what reason now thou hast; To remedie my louing smart? Diana. The very same bindes me as fast, To keepe such danger from my hart. Taurisus. Why dost thou thus torment my minde, And to what end thy beautie keepe? Diana. Bicause thou call'st me still vnkinde, And pitilesse when thou dost weepe. Taurisus. It is bicause thy crueltie In killing me doth neuer end: Diana. Nay for bicause I meane thereby My hart from sorrowes to defend. Taurisus. Behold so foule I am no way As thou dost thinke, falre Shepherdesse: Diana. With this content thee, that I say, That I beleeue the same no lesse. Taurisus. What after giuing me such store Of passions, dost thou mocke me too? Diana. If answers thou wilt anymore Goe seeke them without more adoo. [End now my life, with daily paines affrighted] End now my life, with daily paines affrighted, Since that for all that I haue wept and greeued, My teares are not required, And trustie faith not any whit beleeued. I am in such a haplesse state of sorrowe, That I would be content (and so releeue me) Vniust rewardes and scornes of her to borrow, Onely that she would credit and beleeue me. But though my life is thus with woes despired, And though to be most constant, neuer greeued, My paines are not requited, And trustie faith not any whit beleeued. [Ah such an one I euer was, since that] Ah such an one I euer was, since that My Shepherdesse so cruell I did see, That now I knowe not who I am, nor what My hap shall be, or shall become of mee. I knowe right well that if I were a man, Greefe had my life consumed long agoe: And if a stone, I am most certaine then, That dropping teares had melted me like snowe. Marcelius is my name, who knowes not that? And I am hers, since first I did her see, That now I knowe not who I am, nor what My hap shall be, or shall become of mee. The end of the first booke. The second Booke of Enamoured Diana. [Awake a little, light of cleerest day] Awake a little, light of cleerest day, With calme aspect, with milde and gentle grace, A poore soule to beguile in sorrowes plight: Stretch out that light Apollo from thy face, That ioies the desert Champians in decay, And driest plants with life and secret might: In this most pleasant wood, that doth inuite To sweetest rest, Tormented thou shalt see my brest With carefull greefe (my heauie lot) To see it selfe by him forgot, Who for my scorne a thousand plaintes did waste, The fault is Cupids taste, Who giues and takes on purpose discontent, Where he perceiues he may the more torment. What beastes with mildnesse doe not complaints acquaint, What stone by sighes is not to softnes wrought, The which a wearied brest doth yeeld with paine? What Tigres, or what lions are not brought To ruth and pitie, hearing a complaint Which hath almost vndone my soule in twaine. But to Syrenus I recount in vaine My sorrowfull mishap, Who doth as little care for that, As furious windes in raging seas The teares, that all to little ease, The mariners with carefull hart doe spill: For more they crie, the more it rageth still. Thy loue Syrenus was not fine and good, Which in these fieldes to me thou didst once beare, When as my errour might offend it so: Remember (Traitour) what thou then didst sweare, Neere to the riuer sitting in this wood: What then doth now thy hardnes seeme to show? Shall not a small obliuion long agoe Be helpt by extreme loue? And such, that shall be far aboue My passed hate, and fault before? Then since I cannot loue thee more Nor satisfie the same with greater heate; For remedie, my death I will intreate. Liue yet in paine, the which I feele at last For thee who mak'st my sorrowes lesse appeere, Though more it hurtes my wretched soule, I see, Bicause to haue thy present figure heere, Giues to her thought a sweete delight some tast, Who paining for thy sake doth thinke on thee. But bend thy hart a little vnto me, Ardent in my request. Thou seest I liue in paine opprest, Sustain'd by this desire alone, In all my life to heare but one (No) if thou wilt, in that I most doe loue: But from a man so fierce what shall I proue? Tell me, the fauours how canst thou requite In that time past, Syrenus, when thy hart Thou hadst more tender, now in hardnes dead: When (Traitour) for my cause, with enuies smart A thousand Shepherdes thou didst kill outright: O ioyfull time, and life that I did leade: The vale shall witnes, and the pleasant meade, Where I of Roses white And sweetest flowers, with delight Braue garlands for thy head I had Compacted, and sometimes did adde (Only for thy content) some of my haire, Which greeuous thought my life doth now impaire. Now free, thou dost abhorre me, in the end, Who, for thy sake her selfe in paine consumes: But yet take heede of Cupids fine deceates: For that proud hart, that ouermuch presumes, From cruell loue his senses to defend, The more he yeeldes, the more to striue he sweates: O that thou wert so wounded in his heates, As now my selfe I see: But euer it is vnto mee The best aduise, no good to craue: For whatsoeuer it would haue, Though heauen, and earth the more it doth importune, It euer was denied by Loue, and Fortune. My song, in pine I will no wise ingraue thee, Nor hardned Oke, but rather will commend thee Vnto the windes, where they will tosse and waue thee, And to the deafe and desart Champian send thee: Bicause my torments, of their hope depriued, And memorie of them, which makes me sorie, May be forgot, and neuer be reuiued, Now that my life is lost and chiefest glorie. [Inconstant loue and cruell, which hast lately] Marcelius. Inconstant loue and cruell, which hast lately Setled my happy thoughts, my loue and fire, In such a place so famous, high and stately, Where mortall mens desarts cannot aspire: Well hast thou shew'd thy power By quailing of my sorrow, To double it each hower And make my torments greater euen and morrow: Thou mightst haue left my hart in former sadnes, Bicause lesser harme it were to die with anguish, Then to receiue a gladnes So full of paine: And so by fits to languish, Diana. Thou must not thinke it strange, and must not woonder That thus the mighty Boy of paine and pleasure After one small delight, doth send a hunder Nay thousand paines and torments without measure: For firme repose to any He yet did promise neuer, But cruell deathes, and many Sobs, sighes, and teares, complaintes, and chaines for euer: The Lybian sandes, and Aprils fairest flowers Passe not the greefes, with which fierce loue doth murder Each harte, and into showers Distraines the eies: And yet proceedeth furder. Marcelius. Before that euer Loue my soule inflamed, His slightes, wherein he most of all abounded, I knew right well, wherewith mens harts he tamed And captiues made, and after deepely wounded: Our liues with great offences Not onely he annoteth, But yet our wits and senses And soundest iudgements wholy he destroieth. And so torments a soule, and so encumbers, That one poore ioy it hardly doth recouer: So by ten thousand numbers Most greeuous thoughts surcharge a wretched louer. Diana. If Loues deceites and his dissembling proffers, Wherewith he takes vs, are so knowne and tried, Why then presents the soule it selfe and offers So easily to be taken, and applied? If that the hart so tender The troubles intertaineth That Cupid doth engender, Why after then laments it, and complaineth? Reason it were in loue he should be pained, That to his dartes doth yeeld, and is consenting With fetters to be chained: For ill affoords vs nought but paines tormenting. A Sonnet. [They say Loue sware, he neuer would be frend] They say Loue sware, he neuer would be frend, If mortall Iealousie were not in place: And Beautie neuer be in any face, Vnlesse that Pride did on her thought attend: These are two hags, which hideous hell doth send, Our sweete content to trouble, and disgrace: The one the ioy of loue to paine doth chace, The other pitie from the hart defend. Beautie and Loue were both for sworne, by mee And thee, by making my vnsure estate In ioy and happinesse so fortunate: Bicause since first thy figure I did see Being so Faire, yet Prouder wast thou neuer Nor I in Loue, that could be Iealous euer. A Sonnet. [Wen cruell absence woundes a soule with paine] Wen cruell absence woundes a soule with paine, Then thought is fed with fancies in their kinde: For further of the good remaines, the minde Receiues more ioy, when that it comes againe: He that on hope his ground doth yet sustaine, For all his greefe a remedie shall finde, And for his paines rewardes shall be assign'd: Or dies at lest in loue content and faine: A thousand paines away one ioy doth chace, And to a thousand scornes reuenge presents The onely viewing of an Angels face: But when a soule vile iealousie torments, Though thousand ioyes doe afterwards succeede, Yet bitter greefe and rage the same doth breede. A Sonnet. [As many stars as Heauen containeth, striue] As many stars as Heauen containeth, striue To frame my harme, and lucklesse hap to show: And in th' Earth no grasse nor greene doth growe, That to my greefe may any comfort giue: Loue vnto feare subiected, euer driue A soule to coldest ice: O bitter woe, That he, whom Fortune did contrarie so, Continually with iealousie must liue. The fault I must (Montanus) lay on thee, And all my greefe: on thee I doe complaine (O cruell soule) that pitie dost disdaine; For if thou hadst but taken part with mee, I would not care though gainst me did conspire Heauen, Earth, and Loue, and Fortune in their ire. Filenus letter to Ismenia. Faire Shepherdesse, The cause was Loue, Who (to acquaint thee with his paine) This fault and blame in me did moue To write to thee: But to be plaine, Who would not be both shent and blamed, In thy sweete loues to be inflamed? But if my letter doe offend Thy modest eares, as to too bold: Then vnderstand, that in the end The feare I haue to be controld, My soule with paine and greefe hath fild, And hath the same already kild. I haue to thee ten thousand times My torments told, wherein I liue, Sometimes by speech sometimes by rimes, Which first to me thy selfe didst giue, The which no more thou dost requite, Then mocke, vnto thy great delighte. With open mouth thou laugh'st at mee, And makest it thine onely game To see me die for loue of thee: And I doe ioy to see the same: Although thou laughest at my paine, Which laughter is to me no gaine. And so when that in me I finde The greeuous ill, which makes me die, I thinke (when that comes to my minde) No remedie thou wilt apply. Because to see thou joi'st thy fill, How much my comforts thou dost kill. A remedie thou dost disdaine: And then my soule with hope to feede I see it is as much in vaine, When as it is by loue decreede To haue my life lie in thy hand, And death in thy desire to stand. I sawe thy shining beauties beames, Faire Shepherdesse, vpon a day Neere to great Duerus Christall streames, Making the fields so fresh and gay, And goodly banks to ioy and flourish, The which thy beauties feedes &amp; nourish. And there I sawe thee leane and stand, Among those banks not long agoe, Vpon thy sheepehooke with thy hand, With naked necke as white as snowe, And to thine elbowe (seeming greeued) With naked arme, that was vnsleeued. Where if there had beene anyone, That well had viewed euery part, Admit he were as hard as stone, And had not lou'd thee from his hart: Reason would moue me then to say, That he his folly did bewray. And therefore thus when I had knowne Thy goodly giftes, and beautie rare, From thinking of them one by one No time, nor rest I did not spare: Thus I began loues force to trie, And in his torments thus to die. But if against me thou dost moue Saying, It is to me a shame Being an old man thus to loue So yoong a maide, and so to blame: O giue me no aduice at all, But remedies for which I call. For I will neuer thinke this part Of mine hath made so great a crime, By louing thee with all my hart, As hauing lost so long a time, Before I euer came to knowe Thy beauties which adorne thee so. Alas I knowe that I am olde, And that my prime long since did fall, Which now I wish I had not tolde: But that which greeues me most of all, Is that my louing paine appeeres Not equall with so many yeeres. Bicause since first I came into This life, I would in all that space Haue loued thee as now I doe, Since first I sawe thy sweetest face, And as I must with Cupids powre Vnto my last and dying howre. And let it not thy minde dismay To see my haire so gray and white, For it is ill to take away The place from any, that of right Belongs to him in any reason, Though it comes out of time and season. And though my valour not my hart, And force, not will thou dost exceede, It is not yet so iust a part That any man should leese his meede For being old, or be vnpaide Bicause a souldier now decaide. The buildings newer that they are, And lately built in any sort, By no proportion may compare, For statelines and princely port, (The which antiquitie doth showe) With those of Rome built long agoe. And so in things of woorthines, Of prime or goodnes any way, Of profit, ioy or happines, Commonly vnto this day They say, (and yet do say most true) That th' old is better then the new. Loue wise in that he went about, Till now gaue me no sense of paine, Bicause he sawe it did fall out, That for the most part did remaine, In aged men, and like to mee, More firmnesse as we daily see. To loue thee more then I can tell, I am resolued till I die, And in my firmnesse doe excell Of all loues torments which I trie: But olde againe and not to prooue In all my life, the sweete of loue. Yoong youthes that most of all doe faine Themselues to burne in Cupids heate Are false and double, but to traine Beleeuing women to deceate: For when they say, That they doe die Then doe they liue most merily. And so their false and changing loue, And paines alledged in the same, And all the torments which they prooue Is but their pastime, sport and game, It is their iest and common fashion, It is no will, nor any passion. Besides, Ismenia doe not feare That I am like to one of those Yoong louers, that doe euery wheare Their fauours openly disclose: For sooner they receiue not one, But straight to many it is knowne. For though I doe receiue at lest Three hundred fauours one by one, Yet in my loue I doe protest To be as much a very stone In hiding fauours which I gaine, As that I am in suffring paine. But yet as far as I can see, Resolued as thou art in minde To kill me with thy crueltie, Suer I am that I shall finde Much to endure to be reueal'd, Little ynough to be conceal'd. For now ingratefull Shepherdesse, The greatest fauour which I misse And faine the same would heere possesse, Of all the rest is onely this To die, bicause I would no more Complaine against thee, as before. Time onely will I thee accuse, O time that art so great a friend To greefes, and makest her refuse My loue, who loues her without end. For he that hath most part in thee Is little woorth in loue we see. Alas that euer I did loue Too late a thing so passing faire, And reason therefore that I prooue To die for her in deepe despaire: Since when her birth day did appeere I was not borne that very yeere. If I had beene, faire Shepherdesse, With thee, when I was in my prime As now thou art, then more or lesse, I had not wanted any time, Delights and pastimes to present thee, Nor thy sweete fauours to content mee. For as for playing on a Pipe, Or Rebecke with most sweetest sound To touch with many a daintie stripe, And dauncing best in all the towne, Amongst the youthes to win the prise All in my fauour did arise. And therefore maruell not a whit, If that in song I doe excell Famous Amphion, as vnfit (Compar'd with me) to beare the bell, Since that my singing hath surmounted, Better then he was euer counted. Of fields that goodly graine doe beare I plowe more acres then the rest: And all my mountaines euery where, And plaines that are for pastures best, With flocks of sheepe and goates I cumber, Mark't with my mark that haue no n?ber. But now what bootes my present store (O cruell hap) for my delight? Or that that hath beene heeretofore? Since now it is forgotten quite. Nay which is more, scorn'd and despis'd, And vnto cruell death deuis'd. Then (sweetest foe) let this auaile To make thy hardest hart relent, Strike downe of pride thy puffed saile, When to thine eies age shall present, That in the same thy braue perfection Shall vade, and be in times subiection. O Shepherdesse thou art more hard Then sturdy rocke consum'd in time: But yet perhaps for thy reward When thou hast lost thy golden prime, Then freedomes want shall be thy paine, Wherewith thou dost me now disdaine. Wherefore let Loue take such despite, Reuenging one so much vnkinde, That when all hopes forsake thee quite, And comforts for thy troubled minde, Then he may giue thee store of greefe, And make despaire thy best releefe. The end of the second Booke. The third Booke of Enamoured Diana. [The coole fresh winde, Taurisus, that inuiting vs] Berardus. The coole fresh winde, Taurisus, that inuiting vs Amongst the trees, the leaues is gently shaking, Our sences ioying, and with case delighting vs: The Cotes, and Sicamours sweete shadowes making: The Cristall fountaines, that in copious swelling Doe flowe, our thirst with sauourie liquours slaking: The coloured flower, whose sweete and fragrant smelling To banish melancholie greefes sufficeth, Which makes the hart from sweete content rebelling, His might, that all despiseth, Cannot subdue, nor malice, nor the brauerie, Of that most cruell king, whose sway doth wearie vs, Whose punishment, and slauerie Is absolute, vniust, and meere imperious. For amorous greefes, to hels of paines that ferrie vs, No remedies haue yet beene salutiferous, But still the poison fuming Infects my soule with torments most pestiferous. Taurisus. He that in loue is euermore consuming, Is neuer glad, for such an euill tires him, Liuing in greefe, in greefe his death resuming: Loue giues him paines, and most with torments fires him, When most he seekes his pastime and his pleasure; For then with furious thoughts he most inspires him: Those few times when a soule enioies her treasure, Greefe doth succeede in place, whose balefull souenaunce Makes it returne to playning without measure: Loue will enioy his couenants: And whom he conquers, kils, or prisoner taketh, He thinkes by him to get most famous glorie: His prisoner now, that quaketh, He giues to Fortune, with his Fortune sorie, Or sels to greefe, whom euermore it shaketh, And paints in him her dire and tragicke storie, And him thats burning in his hottest fires He quite consumes, the cruell he retires. Berardus. The whole man waxeth sicke as he intreates him, He turnes each hart from former ioy to sadnes, Still killing him, that liuing is, and threates him, That is most free, with bonds, the scourge of gladnes: Since then (my soule) thou knowest too well how cruell This Tyrant is, be patient, and content thee, That such a place containes thy amorous fuell: (So high a place) Take greefes, and now present thee To all those harmes, and paines he shall enure thee: Enioy thine ill, and in thy greefes maintaine thee, Bicause by how much more thou shalt procure thee A meanes, to rid thy selfe from that that paines thee, The more thou shalt enwrap thee in his briers, And shalt be furdest from thy cheefe desires: Taurisus. Loue findes in me so well disposed matter, And such a minde to amplifie his glorie, That mongst all those, whose mournfull flockes doe scatter On both Hisperias plaines, in loue so sorie, My daily greefes are euer more augmented: Salt showers of teares mine eies haue euer rained: And more, then wretched Biblis malcontented, When turned to a fountaine she remained. Strange is my good, my paine is proper to me, Faine would I see Dianas face, but twenty, And twenty deaths in seeing her vndoe me, I die for want neere to the fount of plenty: Her presence doth with paines and torments fill me, Her absence doth with desperation kill me. Berardus. The woods doe murmur, and the meadow smileth, And iugging nightingales are sweetely singing: But death to thousand woes my hope exileth: Taurisus. The blooming trees smell sweete, that now are springing. The grasse growes greene, with many a painted flower: But I remaine (O woe) in sorrowes stinging: Berardus. My woes my wits haue slaine in such an hower, That now I haue no power To say by hart ten verses all along: Taurisus. My toong doth cleaue euen in my very song, Wherefore (my friend) prolong The time no more, but sing that sweetest dittie, Which interrupted with thy sighes of pitie, And teares, in euery citie And countrie towne, so highly did commend thee. Berardus. Singing with thee, it shall no whit offend me, But ease and pleasure lend me: Then answer me. But now what shall I sing? Taurisus. Sing that that saieth. The radiant star doth bring? Or that: Loues teares doe spring. &amp;c. Or that: I knowe not well how it doth say, Which thou sung'st on a day, Dauncing with faire Diana on a greene. Berardus. No Tigresse nor no lionesse haue beene, But with compassion mooued Of all my torments, able to despaire one: But not that cruell faire one, The fierce deuouresse of my life approoued. Taurisus. The fierce deuouresse of my life approoued, My peerelesse Shepherdesse, As fell in hart, as she is faire in face: How then in such a case Can I escape (O greefe) but die without redresse? Berardus. Can I escape (O greefe) but die without redresse With deathes of racking passions? But when I see Diana faire, her sight my griefes asswageth, Yet then my soule enrageth: The more I haue to doe with loue, the lesse I knowe his fashions. Taurisus. The more I haue to doe with loue, the lesse I knowe his fashions, His seruants he neglecteth And he, that flying seeketh to escape his mortall chaine, With thrise redoubled paine He wounds, and with his furious plagues his wretched soule infecteth. Berardus. Faire Shepherdesse, whose face the heauenly powers Haue graced with more beautie, then the Roses: And sweeter then the purple golden flowers, That deckes our meades and virgins brestes with poses: So may the heauens powre downe in copious plentie Vpon thy flockes their fauours most abounding: And thy faire ewes, with double twins not emptie, In numbers swarme, in profit still redounding: That to my soule, which my demerit pesters, Thou wouldst not shew sterne lookes, nor angrie gestures. Taurisus. Faire Shepherdesse, that with thy neighbour dwelling, Dost cleere thy fieldes bedight with Daffodillies, The driuen snowe in whitenesse far excelling, In beautie Gilloflowres, and stately lillies: So prosper may thy fieldes in euery season In corne, and fruit, which thou maist taste at pleasure: Thy peares, and plums, and apricocks so geason By handfuls maist thou pull in plentious measure: That thou wouldst looke vpon thy swaine so sorie: For of thy sight depends his cheefest glorie. [Welcome thy friendes from swelling seas that rore] Welcome thy friendes from swelling seas that rore With hideous noise, and tost by Neptunes toile, O fortunate and faire Valencia shore, Where nipping frost doth neuer hurt thy soile, Nor Phebus with his woonted parching beames Doth burne thy meades, nor heates thy christall streames. Thrise happy he, who liuing without feare In swallowing seas and billowes to be drownd, Enioies thy golden beauties euery wheare, Of thy sweete meades, greene banks, and fruitfull ground, Thy ground bedeckt with flowres so fine and faire, Maintainde with heauenly deaw and pleasant aire. With greater toile the ship doth cut the seas, Then wearie plowmen doth thy gentle fieldes, Then happy Earth, the ioy and wished ease Of traueled soules, that to thy succour yeeldes, Receiue into thy pleasant woods and caues, Before the sea doth rage in roring waues, Receiue (I say) poore and disastrous men Beaten with stormes and almost cast away, Since now we are arriu'd within the ken Of thy braue coastes, this seuenfold happy day: That I may wash in Turia, as of late, These waters and accursed waues to hate. Nereas Song. In those most happy fieldes and plaines, Where Guadaljar in goodly vaines With christall streames doth glide, Leauing the sweete and pleasant fieldes, Vnto the sea his tribute yeeldes And runs with hastie tide. Faire Galatee full of disdaine, And ioyfull of the woes and paine To Lycius that she gaue: Played vpon the sands and shore, The which the sea sometimes before Doth wash with wallowing waue. Gathering amongst the sandes alone Fine shels, and many a painted stone, As she went vp and downe: And singing many songs so sweete, The which the roring billowes yet Did alter much and drowne. Neere to the water side she hies, And there the waues that fall and rise She view'd with great delight; And fled, when that they came amaine, And sometimes could not, but was faine To wet her feete so white. Lycius, who had in suffring paines No equall in those fieldes and plaines, His torments there suspended, Whiles that he view'd with great content His Shepherdesse so excellent, For beautie most commended. But now comparing his vnrest With all the ioy that she possest, The Shepherd halfe decaied With dolefull voice his sad complaints To shores and champaines he acquaints, And in this manner said. O fairest Nymph, if that thou please, Play not about the roring seas, Although thy chiefe delight Consist therein, yet Galatee As thou dost Licius, so the sea Eschew with hastie flight. And now (sweete Nymph) leaue of to play, For it doth greeue me day by day To see thee on the sandes: O doe not now torment me more, For seeing thee vpon the shore I feare false Neptunes hands. And this doth fill me full of doubtes, That I must credit these my thoughtes, Bicause it is most cleere, That if he die not now for thee, He will no doubt thy louer bee When that he sees thee heere. And this is sure: For loue doth knowe, Since first my soule he wounded so, That I should neuer want A stronger riuall, and more stoute, Then I, who daily would seeke out My true loue to supplant. Leaue then the barren sands and shore, Forsake the cliffes, come there no more, Flie from that dangerous coast: Take heede no monster of the sea Surprise thee not (faire Galatee) Where many haue beene lost. Flie now, and see how I endure Ten thousand greefes to see thee sure, Bicause with double paine Iealous I am of thy content, And for thy dangers imminent Great cares I doe sustaine. In seeing thee so mery and glad, My iealous thoughts doe make me sad, And thinke of Europe faire, Deceiued by a milke white bull, As on the sea bankes she did cull Fine flowers to dresse her haire. And more, my ordinarie cares Make me to thinke, how vnawares Disdainfull Alnade was Dishiuered and deuour'd by A huge sea monster, that did lie Hard by where he did passe. But well away, that I doe see Signes of no feare nor greefe in thee, For this my sorrow knowes, That he, thats not of loue afraide, Can with no dangers be dismaide, And feares not where he goes. O then (my peerelesse Nymph) take heede, Lest Cupid doe reuenge with speede, To see himselfe contemned, For being such a God of might, He will not suffer, but will smite, When he is once offended. Come goe with me vnto the woods, Where euery plant sprout foorth her buds, And to the goodly fieldes, Where we will spend the pleasant howers, Amongst the faire and redolent flowers, That nought but pleasure yeeldes. If waters please thee, I will bring Thee to so faire and fine a spring, That to be first in praise Amongst the rest, thy body white To wash within her waters bright, For thee it onely staies. Disporting in this naked place, Thou hast no vaile to hide thy face, Nor shade from parching sunne, Pitie it were thy beauties blaze, Which enuious Titan feares to gaze, By him should be vndone. Heere hear'st thou no melodious voice, But still a huge and fearefull noise Of monsters hideous raues, And seas, that rore like tumbling thunder, Tost with the windes, that beate asunder The proude and raging waues. What ioy and pleasure canst thou take, To see the tossing billowes shake A ship vpon the sand? And then to see the broken plankes, And carcases in pitious rankes Come swimming to the land. Come to the frithes, and forrests tall, Where nature hath beene liberall With many a pleasant seate. Come to the coole and sweetest shades, Where in greene pathes and open glades We passe away the heate. Flie, flie, those proude and swelling seas, Come, come and thou shalt see what ease We take, and how we sing Ditties so sweete, that in suspence We hold the rockes, and euery sence Of euery liuing thing. And though that some be full of pitie, Loue forceth them to such a dittie, For loue is full of paine: Yet all the Shepherdes will I mooue, To sing no mournefull songs of loue, Onely to please thy vaine. There maist thou reade in euery tree, And euery meade that thou shalt see The loues in knots disguis'd Of iolly Shepherdes, and the names Of chiefest Nymphes, and countrie dames In curious sort deuis'd. But it will make thee sad, I feare, To see thy name ingrauen there, By knowing it was carued By him, whom thou didst euer blot Out of thy minde, and hast forgot, And with disfauours starued. And though thine anger will be such, Yet wilt thou maruell not so much To see thy carued name, As thou wilt woonder then to see, That he doth loue and honour thee, That there did write the same. Not to be loued, and to loue, It is a greeuous greefe to prooue: But what a greefe or paine Could it in thee (faire Nymph) procure, To be beloued with loue so pure, And not to loue againe? But now despis'd I reckon small Faire Galatee my torment all So that thou wilt forsake These swallowing sandes, and seas so high, Where monsters bellow out and crie, And daily praies doe take. What better pastime canst thou finde Neere to the seas of blustring winde, Then in our woods and mountaines To listen to the nightingales, And gather flowers in our vales, And bathe in christall fountaines. I would to God thou liuedst heere, In our faire fieldes and riuers cleere, And for to loue them more, I would to God thou wouldst but see Before I should report to thee How they excell the shore. Bicause I know, the more I praise These woods, meades, springs &amp; louely laies, The lesse thou wilt beleeue me; And wilt not come where thou dost knowe, That part of my content doth growe Which most of all doth greeue me. Poore Lycius would haue spoken more, To win her from that haplesse shore, But that she bad him cease: For with an angrie face and scoule She turn'd vnto the wretched soule, And bad him hold his peace. Then went she to her sportes againe, He to his plaintes and woonted paine: And in the selfesame sort He still remaines in woonted sorrow, She in the sea bankes euen, and morrow, Contented with her sport. [My greeuous sighes and sorrowfull teares] My greeuous sighes and sorrowfull teares In stones doe make their liuely print, But not in thee harder then any flint. The glosse. Let not thy Graces rare, Be with my seruice any whit offended, Since that my greeuous fare, And torments past, to thy deuotions tended, Where neuer yet with greefe of thee lamented, Nor with my sighes thy crueltie relented. Thy hart was neuer changed with my cries, With which I was importunate alwaies To wearied earth and skies: Though thou dost see not onely nights and daies Spilt and consum'd with many feares, My greeuous sighes and sorrowfull teares. In thy conditions strange thou art, That dost not cease with stranger deathes to kill me: But strangest is my sorrowfull hart, That suffring paines wherewith thou dost so fill me, And liuing in so strange and cruell passion, It dies not in most strange and cruell fashion. For if an ill a little time relents, (Although it be the hardest to sustaine) It openeth yet some vents To ease, and doth not giue such mortall paine: But greefe that hath no end nor stint, In stones doe make their liuely print. Loue is a daintie milde, and sweet, A gentle power, a feeling fine and tender, So that those harmes, and paines vnmeete, Which I doe passe, thou onely dost engender: Onely to him his torments loue deuiseth, That scornes his lawes, his rites, and loue despiseth. And this is now my mortall paine and death, That, loue (since first thy beauties I did see) Like to my proper breath, Wherewith I liue, hath euer beene in mee: In me it liues, in me it makes his print, But not in thee, harder then any flint. The Song. [A faire maide wed to prying iealousie] A faire maide wed to prying iealousie One of the fairest as euer I did see, If that thou wilt a secret louer take, Sweete life, doe not my secret loue forsake. The glosse. Beware good Loue, beware it is not well To let blinde Fortune haue a greater part In women, that in Beautie doe excell, More then thy selfe, since such an one thou art: For Beautie being commended to thy power To grace the same, Thou dost thy selfe dishonour euery hower, And art to blame, By suffring, that this thing should euer be, A faire maide wed to prying iealousie. Thou dost but ill, since thou didst euer make Beautie thy friend, who therefore had prepared Sorrowes for him, (that viewed her) for thy sake, Which otherwise she would haue kept and spared: And so my firmnesse, and my faith so pure, And all my paine, A simple sight did not the same procure, Nor did maintaine, But sight of her, and it was onely shee One of the fairest as euer I did see. O Loue! thou kilst so many without end, (For murdring is thy pastime and delight) That once I hope thy selfe thou shalt offend, For want they shall on whom to worke thy spight. Oh then how seemely shalt thou seeme to grone, And wounded see Thyselfe with thine owne griefes, and then thine owne Captiue to be. For thou at last thy selfe shalt not forsake, If that thou wilt a secret Louer take. Then maist thou giue to Louers double smart, And then I will forgiue thee all the care And amorous paines, thou didst to me impart, When that thy selfe (fond Loue) thou dost not spare: And if I blame thy deedes or do reprooue thee, Then shalt thou say, (But to thy selfe) that reason yet did mooue thee To make away Thy selfe, and for thy selfe thy death to take, Sweete life do not my secret loue forsake. A Sonnet. [Hauing no cause, why in the deepest sound] Hauing no cause, why in the deepest sound Of amorous seas my fraile barke dost thou swallow? O Loue! I'le make thy crueltie to sound Swifter from East to West then flying swallow. Though gales of windes doe bluster in my sterne, Yet from the gulfe my ship shall neuer part Of thy braue might, so furious and so sterne, Vntill my sighes doe helpe to blowe apart. If being in a storme, my face I turne, Then my desire is weakned by thy might: Thy force controules my force, that striues in vaine: I neuer shall arriue with happy turne Into the port, and therefore, if I might, I would let out my life in euery vaine. A Sonnet. [Step after step I followe death in sight] Step after step I followe death in sight Through euery field, and hill and troden vale, For euerie day my spirits he doth cite, And warnes my selfe, to shrowde me in his vale. O death, that once thou wouldst consume this light, That still deducts my life in blisselesse bale: Now that my hope hath past away so lgiht, And ioies condemn'd to torments without bale. That Goddesse, whose continuall frownes I beare, And loue, that all my ioies asunder teares, And I my selfe, are foes vnto my hart: She praying on me like a hungrie beare, He chasing me like to the wounded Hart, And I, that doe increase my bootelesse teares. The Song of Turia. Water (faire Springs, and purest running streames) This fortunate and most abundant soile, Comfort the meades and trees, and pleasant aire, Defend the flowers from Titans burning spoile, So with the fauour of the highest beames I will maintaine my bankes so fresh and faire, That these shall haue great enuie of my crowne, The Father of flouds, Rosne, Myncius, and Garoune. Whiles that you goe thus hastening of your course, Winding your streames by many a crooked way, And ioy Valencia fieldes that sweetely smell With sauourie liquours in the hottest day: My weake and feeble breath I will enforce With my diuining spirit to foretell, And sing of those good haps, that shall befall By fauour of the heauens vnto you all. Shepherds, and Nymphes, within these louely dales Whose names resound vnto th' Arcadian fieldes, Giue eare to me: But of the painted flowers, Nor pleasure, that the springs and medowes yeeldes, Nor woods, nor shades, nor warbling nightingales, I will not sing, nor of the countrie powers: But of those famous men and worthy peeres, That shall be heere not after many yeeres. And now I see two Shepherds first in place, Calixtus, and Alexander, whose fames Surmounting the great Cesars chiefe renowne, From Atlas vnto Maurus sounds their names: Whose liues the heauens adorning with their grace, Shall make them both to weare a reuerend crowne: And saue from losse with their industrious heede, As many flockes as in the world doe feede. Of whose illustrous stocke I see arise That man, whose hart base feare cannot rebuke, Well knowne for armes, and many martiall feates, The Roman Cesar, and Valencian Duke: A minde that mounts aboue the hautie skies, Whom yet a cruell fate with murder threates, That that rare strength, braue hart, and noble breath Must haue an end by rawe and bloodie death. The same likewise must in a moment end The glory of Don Hugo de Moncades, With valour, good successe and happy praise, Leauing the Moores subdued by Spanish blades: For Charles his blood most willing he shall spend, After the winning of a thousand daies, And fight he shall with strong and conquering hand Against the French and barbarous Affrican. But ill it doth be fit to talke of those, Whom furious Mars doth kindle with his heate, When learned lampes doe grauely come in place: For heere they shall arise, and shine in great And glorious blaze, as far as Europe goes: The darkest corners shall their lights imbrace. Viues shall liue as long as Daphnes louer Aboue the world with golden wings doth houer. Whose highest skill and learning shall inherit Iohn Honorate, and clime to honours hill, Teaching the mightie Emp'rour of our land: The Muses with great woonder he shall fill, Whom now (me thinkes) I see with greatest merit Bearing a Bishops Crosier in his hand: O that such famous Shepherds, all my sheepe And lambes might feede, and plaines and pastures keepe. About that time Nunnez with praise shall flourish, Who for deepe learning in his tender yeeres, Shall be compar'd vnto the Stagarite: Demosthenes giues place where he appeeres And doth declame, whose eloquence doth nourish His owne and strangers: But O vile despite, And most ingratefull place, whom thou shalt make For Ebrus banks, thy countrie to forsake. But who shall tell you of that musicall, Which many a Poet straining foorth his voice Along my bankes so sweetely shall resound? Heere doe I see how all of them reioice, With fauours that Apollo giues them all, For, singing with a spirit most profound, They shall enlarge this happy countries name, From Pole to Pole with endlesse golden fame. And now I see that man, whose name shall bee Bruted with liuing praise in euery part: Whom I may well for golden verse compare To Phebe, to Mars in armes and martiall art, Ansias March, who (flowring meade) of thee, Loue, vertue, and death, shall sing with verse most rare Taking for honorable and his iust emprese To celebrate the vertues of Terese. Well shall he shew himselfe to be the sonne Of Peter March, who both in peace, and war, Learned in verse, in armes most mighty heere, Shall make his countrie famous very far: Whose noble linage (when that they are done) Wherein renowned valour doth appeere, Shall giue a Iayme, and Arnau in those daies Poets, whom heauen shall fauour many waies. Giorgio del Rey with verse most high and stately My banks shall honour, and with garlands crown'd By all my fairest Nymphes, that shall imbrace him, His name with double ecchoes shall resound: The gentle Planets fauouring but lately His fellow Poets, in such sort shall grace him, That Italie shall woonder at his verse, And die for spite his sweete songs to reherse. Now Fraunces Oliuer, that with thy voice Lifting thee vp vnto the Azur'd heauen, Dost wound the same: And thee renown'd Figueres Whose verse shall be most pleasant, fine and euen, And thee Martin Garcy, that maist reioice, That (mauger death) thy fame time neuer weares: And Innocent of Cubels I doe see, Who well deserues a crowne of Laurell tree. Shepherdes, you shall haue heere a man of woorth, That with the vertue of his secret skill, And herbes, shall helpe your languors and your smartes, And mend your liues with verses at his will: Then Nymphes strow flowers and sweetest herbes powre foorth Vnto great Iayme Royg with thankfull hartes, Crowne him with Bay with Parsley, and with Tyme, For famous skill in phisicke, and in ryme. And great Narcis Vinnols, that to the skie With loftie verse did blaze his woorthy praise, Make him a crowne of Laurell faire and greene, Whose fame shall not (though all the world decaies) Another for a personage most high, Whose verse shall reach as high as may be seene: He shall be matcht with him that loued Laura, His name, the famous Crespi Valladaura. Me thinkes I see an Earle most excellent, The noble Lord surnamed of his Oliue, Which, while the world shall last: amongst his owne And strangers, it shall flourish and suruiue: His comely verse shall shine most orient With perfect light, which he deriues alone From heate that from his Centelles doe arise Shining as bright as stars in cleerest skies. And Nymphes, when that the heauens shall ioy you all With Iohn Fernandz, as now but with supposes, There shall no place be voide in all this land, Where sowe ye may not Lillies and fine Roses: And thou (light fame) stretch out thy flight, and call Thy mighty powers, and vse them heere at hand: And giue him that surname most souerayn Thou gauest vnto the famous Mantuan. And now I doe behold that Poet rare, Iayme Gacull, who in Valencian ryme Did shew his pregnant and his liuely wit, Which mounted to the highest cloudes in time: And Fenollar, whom I well to compare To Tityrus my thoughts cannot omit: For sounding heere his sweetest verse along These banks, the world shall heare his solemne song. Pinedas songs so copious and so fine, Shall also make my sweete banks to resound, By whose braue verse Pan conquer'd needes must be, Tygres made gentle: and they shall rebound His famous name, which neuer shall decline, Vnto the highest spheares in dignitie. I hope by him more honour to obtaine, Then proudest Smyrna did by Homer gaine. Behold the stated, milde, and sweetest grace, Wherewith Vincent Ferrand, a man most graue, Shall shew his highest iudgement, and his skill: Being in his time a Poet rare and braue. His verse shall hold king Aeolus in his place, And stay nay streames from running at their will, Hearing the sweetest sound and harmonie, Of all his verses gracious, graue, and hie. The heauens will not, nor reason will consent, That I should speake with humble stile and plaine Of that choise squadron, and without compare, Aboue mans reach an office to obtaine: Ferran, Sans, Valdellos, and excellent Cordero, and Blasqo a wit most rare, Gacet, more shining lights then faire Aurore, Of whom my spirits now shall sing no more. When of so great a Master I doe thinke, As excellent Borja of Montese, Who shewes his valour, as his wits diuine, As well in verse as any high emprese: Me thinkes, my fieldes, my riuers, and their brinks Shall with more hap and greater glorie shine, Then Tybur hath, though he within her wombe Was borne, that built the stately towne of Rome. And thee who of same father, place, and name, And of the selfe same highest linage bred, Most excellent Don Ioan, whose surname shall In Pindus, and Parnase be honoured. For euerie one to reare his verse shall frame With pen aboue the globe celestiall. The Muses that doe dwell in Helicone, Make for thee there a crowne and stately throne. The Romane people with their heroes Was not so proud, when they did all despise, As my most fertill soile, and I shall be When that great Aguilon shall once arise, Whom both in war, in counsell, and in peace, In verse, and valour, his dexteritie Shall to the highest top of honour reare, Where Marius yet, and Fabius neuer were. Now Seraphin Centellas I doe see, Who lifting vp his high and loftie song, And militarie art vnto the skie, Builds for his verse a fort most sure and strong. And shewes himselfe so braue a man to be In courage, skill, and true nobilitie, That now begins my sweete content of hart, To see his valour, and his great desart. But now I feare me that I cannot praise Don Luys Milan, euen as I doe desire, Who shall in musicke to such skill attaine, That to Orpheus wreathe he shall aspire: His vaine shall be so stately in his daies In heroicke verse, that I beleeue in vaine That they will name before this Adamant Cyno Pystoya, and Guido Caualcante. Thou that shalt get so great apart, and taste Of Pegasus fount, that mighty deaw and sweete, And whom the dwellers of Parnassus hill Shall with a standard of braue poesie greete: (Noble Falcon) heere words I will not waste In praising thee, for fame shall that fulfill: And shall be carefull that thy learned name In all the world with praise she will proclame, Praising alwaies the famous Emperour Charles the great King, Fame makes the world to knowe him; And though aboue the stars she doth commend him, Little it is to that that she doth owe him, You shall behold him to excell so fur, With fauour that the Muses all will lend him, His surname shall the worlde so much delight, That Hesiodes name shall be forgotten quite. He that declares the stately Romane lawes, He that a fine and daintie verse compoundes, He that the wise Lycurgus doth excell, And all the Poets of Verona groundes, Comes next in place, whose golden chariot drawes Fame with her trumpe, his praises to foretell: And this is Oliuer, whose memorie Controules the old and newest historie. Knowing faire Nymphes, your good daies to begin Make thousand outward signes of inward ioy, For now (me thinkes) I doe behold euen then Two famous men who shall their mindes imploy, The one to war, the other still to win Saluation for the soules of sinfull men. Ciurana and Ardenol, who shall raise Their highest verse to heauen with endlesse praise. What? Will you see a iudgement sharpe and sure, A generall skill, a graue and setled minde, A liuely spirit, and a quicke conceate, A sweete consort, poeticall and fine, That sauage beastes to mildnesse doth enure? Of Philip Catalan behold the great Wisedome and wit, who therefore hath no meane A portion in the fountaine Hyppocrene. Heere shall you see a high and loftie wit, Who shall bring honour to our pleasant fieldes, Endowed with a braue and noble spright, Cunning in all things that good letters yeeldes, The learned Pellicer, whose braine shall fit For poemes, making them his chiefe delight: In which his skill and methode shall be great, His iudgement deepe, a sweete and quicke conceate. Behold the man whose noble brest containes Knowledge most rare, and learning generall, Orpheus seemes with him to be combinde, Apollos fauours on his head doe fall: Minerua giues him wit in plentious vaines, And Mars a noble hart and valiant minde: I meane Romani, comming now addressed With all the best, that learning hath professed. Two sunnes within my bankes shall now arise, Shining as bright as Titan in his sphere, And many spring tides in one yeere shall bee, Decking my bankes and meadowes euery where: The hurtfall snowe, nor hard vntempered ice Shall hide my plaines, nor couer any tree When ecchoes in my woods or greenes reherse Vadillos and Pinedas sweetest verse. The meetres of Artiede, and Clement, so Famous shall be in their yoong tender yeeres, That any thinking to excell the same, But base to them and humble shall appeere: And both amongst the wisest sort shall showe Quicke and reposed wits with endlesse name. And after giue vs from their tender flowers Fruits of more woorth amongst more learned powers. The fount, that makes Parnassus of such prize, Shall be Iohn Perez of such woorthy fame, That from swift Tana vnto Ganges source, He shall dilate his admirable name: To stay the hastie windes he shall suffice, And riuers running with most swiftest course, Filling them all with woonder, that shall throng To heare his verse, and graue and solemne song. The man to whom a woorthy name is due Of right, for his abilitie and skill, Whom all my sacred Nymphes in time shall knowe, And all my Shepherdes shall with praises fill For verse most high: amongst the learned crew His honour and his praise shall daily growe: Almudeuar it is, whose shining wing Vnto the stars his golden praise must bring. In vulgar toong the famous Espinose Shall make the historie of Naples cleere, After he hath reuiu'd the memorie Of the Centellas highly linag'd heere With such a loftie style: That fame bestowes His praise abroad, the which shall neuer die: And make this Poet, second vnto none, To be renown'd in worlds but lately knowne. But now I feele a certaine ioy of minde, That makes mine aged hart to leape apace, But onely thinking of that great content, That Bonauida brings into this place: In grauest learning he shall leaue behinde The rest, whose glorie he shall still preuent: His fine and pithie verse, with Laurell drest, In euery age shall sound from east to west. Now Don Alonso comes in place, who shall The Rebolledos surname much increase In all the world, to raise his woorthy name Aboue great Maro he shall neuer cease, And seeme to haue no humane wit at all But singing with most loftie verse: the same, His fine conceit, his art and vaine so high, It seemes he shall haue robbed from the skie. For end of this most sweete and pleasant song And last conclusion of this generall skill, I giue you him, by whom dame Nature shall The Circle of the world with woonder fill: My simple praises should but doe him wrong And all his vertues most heroicall, His valour, wit, nobilitie which graceth His bountie, faith and zeale which he imbraceth. This is Aldana monarch of such might, That iointly souldiours and braue verses makes: That (with great reason) the most famous men As far as Phebus with his light awakes Doe doubte if he be Petrarke Tuscans light, Or Petrarke he: But yet admiring then, To see that where fierce Mars doth shew his face, Apollo milde should haue so great a place. After this captaine there is none whom I With my poore verse may honour and commend, For next vnto the golden sunne that star That brightest shines in darknes must depend: And yet besides the short time doth deme, To praise each one for poesie and war: Farewell, farewell, for vnto you the rest Heereafter I will sing with cleerer brest. The end of the third Booke. The fourth Booke of the third Part of Diana. [The faire, the fresh, the red and rosie morning] The faire, the fresh, the red and rosie morning Doth follow still the long and tedious night, And after darknes comes the sunshine day, When Nymphes goe foorth to walke the freshest meades, The aire resounding with their sweetest songs, And cheerefull notes of many chirping birdes. I am lesse happy then the pretie birdes, That are saluting of the merrie morning, With ratling foorth their sugred notes and songs: For in the morne I mourne, as in the night, Be this a desart or most fragrant meade, Be this a cloudie or most shining day. In such a haplesse hower, and dismall day So dead I was, that neuer can these birdes, Which in the dawning ioy both hill and meade, Nor the Vermillion face of freshest morning Driue from my soule a darke and deadly night, Nor from my brest a lamentable song. My voice shall neuer change her woonted song, And for my selfe it neuer will be day: But I will first die in eternall night, Though more and more doe sing the warbling birdes, And fairer rise the bright and purple morning, To shine vpon, and cherish this faire meade. O irkesome garden! and O dolefull meade! Since she, that cannot heare my plaining song, And with her beames of beautie staines the morning, Doth not giue light vnto my needefull day: O trouble me no more you prating birdes, For without her your morning is but night. In that time of the still and silent night, When in the townes, the hils, the vales, and meades, All mortall men take rest, the beastes and birdes, I most of all doe force my greeuous song, Making my teares euen with the night, and day, At noone, at night, and after in the morning. One Morning onely conquere must my Night, And if one Day illustrate shall this Meade, Then will I heare with ioy the Songs of Birdes. Syrenus. Louers, with pride enioy your full content, To see your selues in fauour and in grace, For I doe ioy to see my torments spent, And ioy to see them in obliuions place: I ioy to see my captiue hart so free, I ioy to see my selfe in libertie. For after suffring worldes of endlesse thrall, The fauours of a proud and scornefull dame So lately come, and seldome doe befall, That euen the best, and greatest of the same Is, not to neede them, nor to be possest Of trifling totes a fond and fained iest. Now laugh mine eies, and thanke Dianas vaine, Thanke her that brought you to this happy turne, Her crueltie and hate your life did gaine, By her disdaine, by her vnseemely scorne Your libertie, in bondage led away, You haue redeem'd, thrise happy be that day. For if by suffring torments for her sake, Ten thousand times more beautifull she weare, And deerest loue to me if she did make, Yet such content, as now in hating her, I should not haue: And this doth ioy my hart, That my disdaine doth beare so great a part. O soueraine God! that once I might but knowe Greefe without hope to sease vpon thy soule, And that the God of loue would wound thee so, And so thy scornefull hart with paines controule, That fully vnreueng'd I might not be, For that great wrong which thou hast done to me. For then I would (and lesse it were not meete) Be to thy greefe so cruell and so fierce, That if with teares, and lying at my feete, Thou didst thy paines and torments all rehearse, And at my handes thy life if thou didst craue, Answere I would, Thy life I would not saue. God graunt thou maist for euer seeke me out, And (Shepherdesse) that I my selfe may hide: That thou might'st say: O turne thee once about, And looke on me: and that I may deride, And answere thee, whom now I haue forgot, Hence (Shepherdesse) away and vexe me not. That thou maist say for thee I die in paining, And on my knees to thee I come a creeping, What noueltie is this, O what disdaining? And I may goe, and leaue thee thus a weeping, And answere thee for paines that I did borrow, I ioy and laugh to see thee in this sorrow. If this thou doubt'st with solemne oth I sweare, That while I liue, I will doe this and more: For now no paines, nor torments I doe feare, And suffer not, as I did once before: And I did neuer loue so much thy name, As from my hart I now abhor the same. And glad I am he hath forgot thee quite, That for thy sake was once so great a foole; And for thy loue did suffer such despite, And such fond lessons in blinde fancies schoole: And it is meete that he should suffer shame, That in these follies was so much to blame. For cruell Loue with Fortune doth agree, And tickle Fortune like to Cupid wauers: Then (iolly Shepherdes) I would counsell yee Not to gape after Loues, and Fortunes fauours: And if ye meane a sweete life to procure, Freedome imbrace, and captiue Loue abiure. O that thou heard'st me now (ingrate Diane) To vnderstand, what I doe say more cleere, And how much more my soule doth yet retaine In plainer termes, if thou wert present heere, To tell thee, that I might vnto thy face Degorge my minde vnto thy great disgrace. But yet it is the best (to ioy my hart) For thee to shun the presence of my sight: For I shall loose (no doubt) no little part Of that great ioy, that pleasure, and delight Of my reuenge, for it would pitie mee And greeue me too I thinke in seeing thee. Then doe I wish, that I may neuer see Thy greeuous presence, nor thy face againe, Bicause vnto my soule it needes must be A greater torment and more cruell paine, To see thee when I sweare, I loue thee not, Then when thou had'st my deerest loue forgot. [O eies that are not now as once tormented] Syrenus. O eies that are not now as once tormented, When first my star enueagled and disguis'd you: O ioyfull thoughts, and quiet minde absented, O carelesse hart, now will I once aduise you, That since you made Diana discontented, To see, loue, thinke on you, let this suffice you, That I doe hold your counsell best of many, In vaine to see, nor loue, nor thinke of any. Arsileus. O eies that haue to greater light attained, Looking vpon that sunne, your onely treasure, O ioyfull thoughts, in thousand ioies distrained, O happy hart, the seate of secret pleasure: Although Belisa would haue once disdained To see, to loue, or thinke on me at leisure, Yet hold I this a heauen, as like was neuer To see, to loue, and thinke on her for euer. Syrenus. Let now the goodly spring tide make vs merie, And fieldes, which pleasant flowers do adorne, And vales, meades, woods, with liuely colours flourish, Let plentious flockes the Shepherds riches nourish, Let hungrie woolues by dogs to death be torne, And lambes reioice, with passed winter wearie: Let euery riuers ferrie In waters flowe, and siluer streames abounding: And fortune, ceaslesse wounding, Turne now thy face, so cruell and vnstable, Be firme and fauourable: And thou that kill'st our soules with thy pretenses, Molest not (wicked loue) my inward senses. Let countrie plainnes liue in ioies not ended, In quiet of the desart meades and mountaines, And in the pleasure of a countrie dwelling: Let Shepherds rest, that haue distilled fountaines Of teares: prooue not thy wrath, all paines excelling, Vpon poore soules, that neuer haue offended: Let thy flames be incended In hautie courtes, in those that swim in treasure, And liue in ease and pleasure: And that a sweetest scorne (my woonted sadnes) A perfect rest and gladnes And hils and dales, may giue me: with offences Molest not (wicked loue) my inward senses. In what law find'st thou, that the freest reason, And wit, vnto thy chaines should be subiected, And harmelesse soules vnto thy cruell murder? O wicked loue, the wretch that flieth furder From thy extremes thou plagu'st. O false, suspected, And carelesse boy, that thus thy sweetes dost season, O vile and wicked treason. Might not thy might suffice thee, but thy fuell Of force must be so cruell? To be a Lord, yet like a Tyrant minded, Vaine boy with errour blinded, Why dost thou hurt his life with thy offences, That yeelds to thee his soule and inward senses. He erres (alas) and fowly is deceiued That cals thee God, being a burning fire, A furious flame, a playning greefe and clamorous, And, Venus sonne (that in the earth was amorous, Gentle, and milde, and full of sweete desire) Who calleth him, is of his wits bereaued, And yet that she conceaued By proofe, so vile a sonne and so vnruly, I say (and yet say truly) That in the cause of harmes, that they haue framed, Both iustly may be blamed: She that did breede him with such vile pretenses, He, that doth hurt so much our inward senses. The gentle sheepe and lambes are euer flying The rauening woolues and beastes, that are pretending To glut their mawes with flesh they teare asunder: The milke white doues at noise of fearefull thunder Flie home amaine, themselues from harme defending, The little chicke, when puttocks are a crying: The woods and meadowes dying For raine, of heauen (if that they cannot haue it) Doe neuer cease to craue it: So euery thing his contrarie resisteth, Onely thy thrall persisteth In suffring of thy wrongs without defences, And lets thee spoile his hart and inward senses. A publike passion, natures lawes restraining, And, which with wordes can neuer be declared: A soule twixt loue, and feare, and desperation, And endlesse plaint, that shuns all consolation, A spendlesse flame, that neuer is impaired: A friendlesse death, yet life in death maintaining: A passion, that is gaining On him, that loueth well and is absented: Whereby it is augmented, A iealousie, a burning greefe and sorrow. These fauours louers borrow Of thee fell Loue, these be thy recompences, Consuming still their soule and inward senses. Arsileus. O let that time a thousand monthes endure, Which brings from heauen the sweete and siluer showres, And ioies the earth (of comforts late depriued) With grasse and leaues, fine buds, and painted flowres: Eccho returne vnto the woods obscure, Ring foorth the Shepherds songs in loue contriued: Let olde loues be reuiued, Which angrie winter buried hath of late: And that in such a state My soule may haue the full accomplishment Of ioy and sweete content: And since fierce paines and greefes thou dost controule, Good loue doe not forsake my inward soule. Presume not (Shepherds) once to make you mery With springs, and flowres, or any pleasant song, (Vnlesse milde loue possesse your amorous brestes) If you sing not to him, your songs doe werie, Crowne him with flowres, or else ye doe him wrong, And consecrate your springs to his behestes: I to my Shepherdesse My happie loues with great content doe sing, And flowres to her doe bring. And sitting neere her by the riuer side, Enioy the braue springtide. Since then thy ioies such sweetnesse doe enroule, Good loue doe not forsake my inward soule. The wise in ancient times a God thee nam'd, Seeing that with thy power and supreme might Thou didst such rare and mighty woonders make: For thee a hart is frozen and inflam'd, A foole thou mak'st a wise man with thy light, The coward turnes couragious for thy sake: The mighty Gods did quake At thy commaund: To birdes and beasts transformed: Great monarches haue not scorned To yeeld vnto the force of beauties lure: Such spoiles thou dost procure With thy braue force, which neuer may be toulde With which (sweete loue) thou conqu'rest euery soule. In other times obscurely I did liue But with a drowsie, base, and simple kinde Of life, and onely to my profit bend me: To thinke of loue my selfe I did not giue, Or for good grace, good partes, and gentle minde Neuer did any Shepherdesse commend me: But crowned now they send me A thousand garlands, that I woon with praise, In wrestling daies by daies, In pitching of the bar with arme most strong, And singing many a song, After that thou didst honour, and take hould Of me (sweete loue) and of my happy soule. What greater ioy can any man desire, Then to remaine a captiue vnto loue, And haue his hart subiected to his power? And though sometimes he taste a little sower, By suffring it, as milde as gentle doue, Yet must he be, in lieu of that great hire Whereto he doth aspire: If louers liue afflicted and in paine, Let them with cause complaine Of cruell fortune, and of times abuse, And let them not accuse Thee (gentle loue) That dost with blisse enfoulde Within thy sweetest ioies each louing soule. Behold a faire sweete face, and shining eies, Resembling two most bright and twinkling stars; Sending vnto the soule a perfect light: Behold the rare perfections of those white And Iuorie hands, from greefes most sure bars: That minde wherein all life and glorie lies, That ioy that neuer dies, That he doth feele, that loues and is beloued, And my delights approoued To see her pleas'd, whose loue maintaines me heere: All those I count so deere, That though sometimes Loue doth my ioies controule, Yet am I glad he dwels within my soule. [Let now each meade with flowers be depainted] Let now each meade with flowers be depainted, Of sundrie colours sweetest odours glowing: Roses yeeld foorth your smels, so finely tainted, Calme windes, the greene leaues mooue with gentle blowing: The christall riuers flowing With waters be increased: And since each one from sorrowes now hath ceased, (From mournefull plaints and sadnes) Ring forth faire Nymphes, your ioyfull songs for gladnes. Let springs and meades all kinde of sorrow banish, And mournefull harts the teares that they are bleeding: Let gloomie cloudes with shining morning vanish, Let euery bird reioice, that now is breeding: And since by new proceeding, With marriage now obtained, A great content by great contempt is gayned, And you deuoid of sadnes, Ring forth faire Nymphes, your ioyfull songs for gladnes. Who can make vs to chaunge our firme desires, And soule to leaue her strong determination, And make vs freeze in Ise, and melt in fires, And nycest harts to loue with emulation: Who rids vs from vexation, And all our minds commaundeth? But great Felicia, that his might with standeth That fild our harts with sadnes, Ring forth faire Nymphes, your ioyfull songs for gladnes. Your fields with their distilling fauours cumber (Bridegroome and happie Bride) each heauenly power Your flockes, with double lambes increas'd in number, May neuer taste vnsauourie grasse and sower: The winters frost and shower Your kids (your pretie pleasure) May neuer hurt, and blest with so much treasure, To driue away all sadnes, Ring forth faire Nymphes, your ioyfull songs for gladnes. Of that sweete ioy delight you with such measure, Betweene you both faire issue to ingender: Longer then Nestor may you liue in pleasure: The Gods to you such sweete content surrender, That may make milde and tender The beasts in euerie mountaine, And glad the fields and woods and euerie fountaine, Abiuring former sadnes, Ring forth faire Nymphes, your ioyfull songs for galdnes. Let amorous birds with sweetest notes delight you, Let gentle winds refresh you with their blowing, Let fields and forrests with their goods requite you, And Flora decke the ground where you are going: Roses, and vilets strowing, The Iasmine and the Gilloflower With many more: and neuer in your bower To taste of houshold sadnes, Ring forth faire Nymphes, your ioyfull songs for gladnes. Concord and peace hold you for aye contented, And in your ioyfull state liue yee so quiet, That with the plague of iealousie tormented Ye may not be, nor fed with Fortunes dyet: And that your names may flie yet To hils vnknowen with glorie, But now bicause my brest so hoarse, and sorie It faints, may rest from singing, End Nymphes your songs, that in the clouds are ringing. The end of the fourth Booke. The fifth Booke of the third Part of Diana. [I should haue dide, and neuer viewed thee] I should haue dide, and neuer viewed thee (Faire Shepherdesse, vnwoorthily forgot) Since that I durst presume to liue, and bee Before thy sweetest sight, and loue thee not. A happy loue, and fortune I should prooue, Both which my paines and sorrowes should abate, If by remembring of thy deerest loue, I should forget the greefe of former hate. For now the feare of death, and leesing thee, I feare will be my guerdon and my lot, Since that I durst presume to liue, and bee Before thy sweetest sight, and loue thee not. [My soule doth leape for ioy to haue] My soule doth leape for ioy to haue My wished loue againe, For there's no other ioy to craue, Nor greefe to giue me paine. I doe not thinke of sorrowes past, Our loue it may offend: Of any present greefe to taste, For hate that hath an end. Reioice (my soule) such blisse to haue, Since with so high a game, There is no other ioy to craue, Nor greefe to giue me paine. [Svch ioy I feele doth in my soule surmount] Svch ioy I feele doth in my soule surmount, That now againe I thinke it nothing strange: If that a pleasure of so great account Doth cost two thousand torments for exchange. Rtill did I looke but still my comforts staied, But when my soule did once enioy the same, With their content and sweete delight I paied My staying, and their tariance did not blame. Let paines therefore within my soule surmount, Sorrowes and plaints to me shall not be strange, If for a pleasure of so great account, They giue me thousand torments in exchange. [Tvrne thy faire eies (wherein my shame] Tvrne thy faire eies (wherein my shame I see) faire Shepherdesse, aside: For looking on me with the same, To looke on thee, I am denide. With thy two sunnes so dost thou giue, And cast me beames with pearcing eie, That though by seeing thee I liue, Yet when thou look'st on me I die: Eies that are of such art and frame, Thou must beware to keepe aside, For looking on me with the same, To looke on thee I am denide. Like as the snowe vnto the sunne, And as the marke vnto the sight, As cloudes are with the windes vndone, As waxe before the fires light: So doe thy fairest eies with shame Confound me, and my soule deuide: For looking on me with the same, To looke on thee I am denide. Behold what mightie loue is bent To doe, and fortune doth ordaine To make my sorrowes still augment By the sweete guerdon of my paine. Thine eies doe feede my amorous flame, And sight of them my life doth guide: But if thou view'st me with the same, To looke on thee I am denide. [Yong Shepherd) turne aside, &amp; moue] Yong Shepherd) turne aside, &amp; moue Me not to follow thee, For I will neither kill with loue, Nor loue shall not kill mee. Since I will liue, and neuer fauour showe, Then die not for my loue I will not giue: For I will neuer haue thee loue me so, As I doe meane to hate thee while I liue. That since the louer so doth proue His death, as thou dost see, Be bold I will not kill with loue, Nor loue shall not kill mee. [If to belou'd it thee offends] If to belou'd it thee offends, I cannot choose but loue thee still: And so thy greefe shall haue no end, Whiles that my life maintaines my will. O let me yet with greefe complaine, Since such a torment I endure: Or else fulfill thy great disdaine, To end my life with death most sure. For as no credit thou wilt lend, And as my loue offendes thee still, So shall thy sorrowes haue no end Whiles that my life maintaines my will. If that by knowing thee, I could Leaue of to loue thee as I doe, Not to offend thee, then I would Leaue of to like and loue thee too, But since all loue to thee doth tend, And I of force must loue thee still, Thy greefe shall neuer haue an end, Whiles that my life maintaines my will. [Methinks, thou tak'st the woorser way] Methinks, thou tak'st the woorser way, (Enamoured Shepherd) and in vaine, That thou wilt seeke thine owne decay, To loue her, that doth thee disdaine. For thine owne selfe, thy wofull hart Keepe still, else art thou much to blame, For she, to whom thou gau'st each part Of it, disdaines to take the same: Follow not her that makes a play, And iest of all thy greefe and paines, And seeke not (Shepherd) thy decay To loue her, that thy loue disdaines. [Since thou to me wert so vnkinde] Since thou to me wert so vnkinde, My selfe I neuer loued, For I could not loue him in my minde, Whom thou faire Mistresse dost abhor. If viewing thee, I saw thee not, And seeing thee I could not loue thee, Dying, I should not liue (God wot) Nor, liuing, should to anger moue thee. But it is well that I doe finde My life so full of torments: For All kinde of ills doe fit his minde, Whom thou (faire Mistresse) dost abhor. In thy obliuion buried now My death I haue before mine eies, And heere to hate my selfe I vow As (cruell) thou dost me despise: Contented euer thou didst finde Me with thy scornes, though neuer (for To say the truth) I ioyed in minde, After thou didst my loue abhor. [Shepherd, why dost thou hold thy peace?] Sylu. Shepherd, why dost thou hold thy peace? Sing: and thy ioy to vs report. Arsil. My ioy (good Shepherd) should be lesse, If it were told in any sort. Sylu. Though such great fauours thou dost win, Yet deigne thereof to tell some part: Arsil. The hardest thing is to begin. In enterprises of such arte. Sylu. Come, make an end, no cause omit Of all the ioies that thou art in, Arsil. How should I make an end of it, That am not able to begin. Sylu. It is not iust, we should consent, That thou shouldst not thy ioies recite, Arsil. The soule that felt the punishment Doth onely feele this great delight. Sylu. That ioy is small, and nothing fine, That is not told abroad to many, Arsil. If it be such a ioy as mine. It can be neuer told to any. Sylu. How can this hart of thine containe A ioy, that is of such great force? Arsil. I haue it, where I did retaine My passions of so great remorce. Sylu. So great and rare a ioy as this No man is able to withhold, Arsil. But greater that a pleasure is, The lesse it may with words be told. Sylu. Yet haue I heard thee heeretofore Thy ioies in open songs report: Arsil. I saide, I had of ioy some store, But not how much, nor in what sort. Sylu. Yet when aioy is in excesse, It selfe it will vnfold, Arsil. Nay such aioy should be the lesse, If that it might be told. A Riddle. [Neere to a Shepherd did a damsell sit] Neere to a Shepherd did a damsell sit, As leane as withered sticke by scorching flame: Her body as full of eies as might be in it, A toong she had, but could not mooue the same. Her winde she drew aboue, and eke beneath, But from one part she neuer yet did change, A wofull Shepherd came to kisse her breath, Then made she plaints most sorrowfull and strange: The more the Shepherd put his mouth vnto Her mouth in stopping it, she cried amaine, Opening her eies, and shutting them againe. See now what this dumbe Shepherdesse could doe, That when her mouth he did but touch or kisse, He waxeth dumbe, but she still speaking is. A Riddle. [I sawe a hill vpon a day] I sawe a hill vpon a day, Lift vp aboue the aire: Which watered with blood alway And tilled with great care, Herbes it brought foorth Of mickle woorth. Pulling a handfull from that ridge And touching but the same, Which leauing neere vnto a bridge, Doth cause much sport and game, (A thing scarce of beleefe) Lamenting without greefe. A Riddle. [What bird is that so light] What bird is that so light, Her place that neuer changeth: She flies by day and night, In all the world she rangeth: Ouer the sea at once she flies, Mounting aboue the loftie skies. She's neuer seene by eies, And who doth seeke to show her Hath beene accounted wise: Yet sometimes we doe knowe her, Onely the wals by viewing well Of her close house, where she doth dwell. A Riddle. [Tell me what Master he may be] Tell me what Master he may be, Whose Master is his man? Bound like a sencelesse foole is he, Wittie, it nothing can. Vnlearned, yet he doth abound In learning graue and most profound: When that I take him by the hand, Although I heare him not, His meaning yet I vnderstand, Though him I haue forgot. So wise is he, though wordes nor motions showing, Yet thousand things he tels me woorth the knowing. A Riddle. [Shew me a horse of such a kinde] Shew me a horse of such a kinde, That in the strangest fashion Doth neuer eate, but of the winde Doth take his sustentation: Winged before, and wing'd behinde: Strange things he doth, and wondrous deeds: And when he runs his race, Vpon his brest with haste he speedes. His reines with maruellous grace Come from his sides that neuer bleedes. And in his course he doth not faile, If rightly he doth wag his taile. A Riddle. [Tell me (good Sirs) what Bird is that that flies] Tell me (good Sirs) what Bird is that that flies Three cubits high, and yet doth neuer rise, With more then thirtie feete that mount and fall, With wings that haue no plume nor pens at all: Beating the aire it neither eates, nor drinks, It neither cries, nor sings, nor speakes, nor thinks. Approching neere vnto her cruell death, She wounds, and kils vs with the stones she throwes: A friend to those that spend their deerest breath In spoiles, and thefts, in mortall wounds and blowes: Wherein she takes her pleasure and her fill, Hiding the men in waues that she doth kill. Florisias Song. Flie storming verse out of my raging brest With furious anger, malice, and despite: Indigned spirits, once at my request Powre foorth your wrath and pen prepare to write With scornefull stinging and inuectiue stile, Against a people brutish, base, and vile: A vile, peruerse and monstrous kinde of men, Who make it but their pastime, and their game, With barbarous mouth and with vnciuill pen To slaunder those, who lest deserue the same: Women I meane a workmanship diuine, Angels in shape, and Goddesses in minde. Thou wicked man that dost presume too hie Of thy perfections, but without desart, False man I say, accustomed to lie, What euill canst thou thinke within thy hart, Or speake of her, whose goodnes more or lesse, Doth fill the world so full of happinesse, But onely this, that woman was the cause, Though not alone, of one exceeding ill, In bringing foorth (constrained by natures lawes) A man, whose mischiefes all the world doth fill: Who after that he is conceiu'd and borne, Against his mother proudly liftes his horne. Whom if she had not borne, poore silly dame, With fewer greefes her life she might haue lead, For then he should not slaunder thus her name, And such a crowe she should not then haue bred, That being hatch'd, her dam would thus despise, And daily labour to plucke out her eies. What man in all the world did euer knowe, (Although the tendrest father he had beene) Those cares, and greefes, that sorrow, and that woe, Which wiues haue for their husbands felt, and seene? And how the louing mother for her sonne With sorrow hath beene oftentimes vndone? Behold with what affection, and what ioy, What gentlenes, and what intensiue loue, The mother doth intreate her little boy? Which after doth a Traitour to her prooue: Requiting ill her paines and loue so kinde With powring sorrowes still into her minde. What iealous feares, what fearefull iealousies, Doe haunt the mother for her cruell sonne? What paine, when that in any paine he lies, What greefe, when that with greefe he is vndone? What perfect gladnes, and what sweete content, When that he is to any goodnes bent? Alas how pensiue and how sad they ar, If that their husbands suffer any paine: What sorrow, when they trauell somewhat far, What moane, when that they come not soone againe: A thousand greefes to heare their losse of wealth, Ten thousand deathes to heare their want of health. But men that are so full of false deceate, Our daily sorrowes neuer doe requite, Or thinke of them, though they be neuer so great, But rather such their malice and despite Is; that our louing cares both great and small, Vniust suspects, and iealousies doe call. The cause of which surmise is onely this, That as these wicked and detested men Of custome are enclined to stray amisse, And in false loue their wits and wealth to spend, Do thinke it now a burden to their liues, To be belou'd so truely of their wiues. Then since in louing them we euer finde Our selues apayde with hatefull scorne and blame, I thinke it best, for easing of our minde, Quite to forget their nature, sexe, and name: Or else to leaue our ioies in looking on them, Or if we looke, not once to thinke vpon them. But yet it is a pretie iest to see Some kind of men, whose madnes is so great, That if the woman will not wholly bee At their desires, then in a franticke heat They call her Tygresse, cruell, and vnkinde, And traiteresse vnto a louing minde. Then shalt thou see these men vnseemely call The modest women, whom they would haue naught, Coy and disdainfull to conuerse withall: And her that's chaste, vnmanner'd and vntaught. Those that be wise and sober, full of pride: And cruell those, whose honesties are tride. I would to God that those dishonored names Did fit them all, as well as all the rest, Then none of them should bide so many shames, Nor be deceiu'd by men, that loue them lest: For being cruell, proude, and rusticall, They would not loue, nay could not loue at all. For if the thing, which they so faine would haue, By any meanes they cannot once obtaine, Then do they wish for death, or for their graue: But yet the same no sooner they attaine, But make it but a sport and merie game, And straight forget that ere they lou'd the same. They faine themselues most sorrowfull and sad, And wearied with a long and painfull life: They still do tell the paines that they haue had, And other lyes, which are with them so rife: They call themselues vnhappie, poore, and blinde, Confounded slaues, yet all but words of winde. O how they can make Oceans of their eies! And terme their flames their torments and their paines, And breath out sighes, like vapours in the skies, And belch out sobs like Aetnas burning vaines: And crie, lament, and mourne, and otherwhile Dissemble like the weeping Crocodile. Sometimes they make themselues like conquered slaues, Sometimes themselues most valiant they do faine, Sometimes great Lords, with many other braues, Sometimes throwen downe, and vanquished againe: Their wounds their ioyes, their paines their pleasures make And happie comfort in their prisones take. A thousand times they curse their haplesse stars, Despising life, and happie death implore: Yet in the end so valiant in these wars Of life and death, and other passions more, That thousand deaths they say they passe and trie, And yet they neuer make an end to die. They giue, they gaine, they heale, they wound, they plie, their soule, their life, their harms, their harts, their teares, they ioy, they liue, they burne, they paine, they die, with hap, with hope, with heate, with greefe, with feares. And so in all their loues, and what they say, There is a strange confusion euerie way. And for this cause when Melibe in vaine With daily suites his loue to me did make, By telling me his amorous greefe and paine, and euerie other passion for my sake: I answered him (good Shepherd) let not grieue thee, I vnderstand thee not, and lesse beleeue thee. See therefore men how iustly you deserue To leese our loue defam'd by your abuse: Since from this counsell we must neuer swerue, (As by the wisest dayly put in vse) To put no faith nor trust in any lyer, Nor loue that man, whom loue cannot inspire. From this day therefore call vs now no more Vnpitifull and cruell homicides, For tis no reason, that vpon our score You should nicke vp so many merie tides, Nor with our liues and honours (to our cost) Enrich your selues, and after make your boast. For if (perhaps) a chaste and honest maide Should looke vpon you in familiar sort, Or talke with you, then straight it would be saide, That she is light, and then with false report Will iudge her naught, by fauouring with a kisse: Fie shamelesse men, why blush you not at this. And in this sort the Shepherdesse and dame Of what degree soeuer that they bee, On euerie side doth suffer wrong and blame, Since that your wicked toongs in one agree To call them shamelesse if they loue you well; And cruell, if your loue they do expell. And now you hold vs (which is worst of all) For such accursed women, and so naught That all those ils which vnto you befall, You say you haue them onely by our fault. For your misfortunes, deaths, and other harme. You say they come by our enchants and charmes. Nay they do rather happen vnto you By want of wisedome and your simple sence, And not by our beautie; for most true It is that Paris folly and offence Did cause the ruine of King Priames towne: And not faire Hellens beautie cast it downe. But why so like dishonest women do you With lying toongs so basely vs entreate? When that so oft you do allure vs to you With feastes, and maskes, and all of them so great, That scarce you let vs rest in any sort, But forcibly do draw vs to your sport. Then of our honours, and of our estates You haue no care, and no respect at all, For we no sooner gone out of your gates, And from your feastes, which we regarded small, But by and by your toongs do goe awrie, Misterming vs that could not you denie. And yet you are so blinded in this ill, And troublesome, when that your suites you mooue, That you will haue the woman (gainst her will) To die in hot desire of your loue. So rude you be, that you are not content To haue some small and modest fauour lent. And thus the liues of these poore silly dames, Which otherwise were modest, milde, and chaste, And therewithall their honours, and good names, Like traitours vile you conquer, spoile, and waste. So that those women, that haue gone astray, By your meanes were brought vnto decay. But now what pen, what toong or golden verse Of women may the vertues rare set downe? How may my simple skill and wit reherse Their praises and perfections of renowne? Their constancie, their loue, and faith so pure, Which in their harts remaines so firme and sure. In many things the greatnes of their minde They shew, contemning base and doubtfull feare: As those, whose tender loue hath beene so kinde Vnto their husbands, when they liuing were, That all their moanes and sorrowes for their death They ended soone, by stopping of their breath. And if for vertue, and his chaste intent Hippolytus deserued any praise, On th' other side behold that excellent And noble Roman Matrone in her daies With stabbing dagger giuing vp the ghost, I meane faire Lucrece, for her honour lost. It was no doubt great valour in the youth, As neuer like hath beene in all the rest, Who vowing to his father faith and truth, Deni'd his stepdames foule and fond request. All which admit: Hippolytus is but one, But thousands of Lucrecias haue beene knowne. Giftes haue we more (our beauties set aside) For in good letters famous haue we bin: And now to prooue our iudgements often tride, And sharpnes of our finest wits therein, Let Sappho and Corynna well suffice, Who when they liu'd, for learning got the prise. And learned men doe therefore banish vs Their schooles, and places where they do dispute, For feare (if we should argue and discusse) With praise we should their arguments confute: Too proud therefore, they would not by their will, That women should excell them in their skill. And if some authors, scorned in their loues, Haue written ill of women, in their hate, Not this our credits any whit disprooues, And can as lesse diminish our estates: Since they themselues haue writ as ill of men, Beleeue not then their lying toongs and pen. Yet this doth cause some small and little change, And alteration in our great desarts: For they must needes (and sure it is not strange, Considering their vile malicious harts) In whatsoeuer they doe write or say, To speake the woorst of women that they may. But yet among these Authors thou shalt finde Most famous women, and most excellent: Peruse their works but with indifferent minde, And thou shalt see what numbers they present Of good and honest Dames, before thine eies, Of louing, faithfull, holy, chaste, and wise. They doe adorne the world with goodly graces, And with their vertues giue it golden light: The shining beautie of their sweetest faces Doth fill each hart and eie with great delight. They bring all comforts, gladnes, peace, and ioy, And driue away all sorrowes, and annoy. By them (false men of bad and wicked mindes) You get great honour, glorie, and renowne: And for their sakes, inuenting sundry kindes Of verses, get sometimes the Laurell crowne: And for their loue, in Martiall feates againe To golden praise and fame you doe attaine. You therefore that imploy your wits and time, In searching out the course of others liues, If that you finde some woman toucht with crime Amongst so many widowes, maides, and wiues: Condemne not all for one poore soules offence, But rather hold your iudgements in suspence. And if so many Dames so chaste, and faire, Cannot subdue your proud and hautie harts, Behold but one, whose vertues are so rare, To whom the heauens so many goods imparts, That onely she possesseth in her brest As many giftes, nay more then all the rest. The brauest men, and most heroicall, And those that are most perfect in conceate, I see this Lady far excell them all, With her diuine perfections, and so great, Which Orpheus did sing vpon a day, As on his harpe most sweetely he did play. Saying: That in that happy land, where white And chalkie cliffes are steept in Brittish seas, A morning star should rise exceeding bright, Whose birth will siluer Cynthia much displease, In that her golden light, and beauties gleames Shall far surpasse her brothers borrowed beames. And such a Lady shall she be indeede, That she shall ioy each hart with happy chaunce: Her woorthy house, wherein she shall succeede, With titles of great praise she shall aduaunce: And make the same more glorious and more knowne, Then euer did the Affrican his owne. Make triumphes then for birth of such a dame, And let each hart be glad that hath beene sorie: Reioice Meridian springs from whence she came; You linage her, she honours you with glorie, Her name from East to West, from North to South Is well esteem'd and knowne in euery mouth. Come then you Nymphes, resigne to her your powers, Faire Nymphes that follow Cynthia in her chace, Come waite on her and strowe the ground with flowers, And sing in honour of her matchlesse grace: And Muses nine that dwell in mount Parnasse Let verse nor song without her praises passe. Thou dar'st not Rome (in seeing her) presume With Brutus stately Iland to compare, But sooner wilt thy selfe with greefe consume, To see how far she doth excell those faire Ladies of Rome renowned in their daies, In euery thing wherein they got most praise. In bountie Porcia she shall much exceede, In wisedome passe Cornelia Pompeies wife, In honour Liuia, so haue her stars decreed, And chaste Sulpitia in modestie of life: Her beautie and the vertues in her brest, Eugeria staines, and conquers all the rest. This is the Thought that honours my desire, This is my Parnasse and Aonian spring, This is the Muse that giues me holy fire, This is the Phœnix with her golden wing, This is the star, and power of such might, That giues me glorie, spirit, plume and light. Petrarke had left his Laura all alone, Folchet Aldagias praise with loftie stile, Guilliaum the Countesse of Rossiglion, Raymbald his Lady Morie Verdefueille, To grace his verse he would besides refuse The Countesse of Vrgiel for his Muse. Anacreon Euripile defied And Americ, Gentile, Gascoignes light: Raymbald the Lord of Vacchieres denied Of Monferrato Beatrice to delight With sweetest verse to win her noble grace Sister vnto the Marquis Boniface. Arnoldo Daniel had as much repented Bouilles praise his Lady long agon, Bernard had neuer with his verse contented The faire Vicountesse of Ventideon. (Though these were Dames of beautie and renowne, Gracing each Poet with a Laurell crowne.) If they had seene this Lady in their time, Who all their giftes and beauties doth possesse, They had strain'd foorth inuention, verse, and rime, To celebrate so high a Patronesse. On her their thoughts and pens they had imployed, Happy so rare a Muse to haue enioyed. This did Orpheus sing with sweetest verse, And Eccho answered to his siluer voice, And euery time he did the same rehearse, The land and sea did presently reioice To heare the ioyfull newes of such an one, By whom their honour should be so much knowne. Now then from this day foorth and euermore Let wicked men their false opinions leaue, And though there were not (as there is) such store Of woorthy Dames (as vainly they conceiue) This onely one with honour shall recall, And amplifie the glorie of vs all. [Poore Melibee of loue and hope forgot] Poore Melibee of loue and hope forgot, Told to Florisia greefes that he had past, She answered him: I vnderstand thee not, And lesse beleeue thee (Shepherd) what thou saiest. He saith: My peerelesse Shepherdesse, Behold the paine wherewith I die, Which I endure with willingnesse, And seeke that greefe, which I would flie: My hot desires doe burne and die I wot, Hope is my life, but feare the same doth waste: She answered him: I vnderstand thee not, And lesse beleeue thee (Shepherd) what thou saiest. He saith: The pale and pinching care Hath beene so pleasant to my minde, That how much more fals to my share, The more I doe desire to finde: I craue no guerdon for my painefull lot, But as I loue, to be belou'd as fast: She answered him: I vnderstand thee not, And lesse beleeue thee (Shepherd) what thou saiest. He saith: My death should now redresse My paines, but for the greeuous ill Which I should feele (faire Shepherdesse) In leauing of to see thee still: But if I see thee sad, a harder knot Of greefes I feele, and greater death doe tast: She answered him: I vnderstand thee not, And lesse beleeue thee (Shepherd) what thou saiest. He saith: In seeing thee I die, And when I see thee not, I paine, In seeking thee, for feare I flie, I haue to finde thee out againe. As old Proteus was woont to change his cote, Figure, and shape which long time did not last: She answered him: I vnderstand thee not, And lesse beleeue thee (Shepherd) what thou saiest. He saith: I doe pretend to craue No more good then my soule can get: Bicause with that small hope I haue, (Me thinkes) I doe offend thee yet. For suffring for thy sake the smallest iot Of wounding greefe a thousand ioies I tast: She answered him: I vnderstand thee not, And lesse beleeue thee (Shepherd) what thou saiest. Prouençall Rythmes. When that with thousand parti-coloured flowers The springtide comes in euerie pleasant mead, And glorious Titan, free from winters showers, With golden beames the fields doth ouerspread, The Shepherds rich, and frollicke in their bowers, With pipes and songs their flockes to fields do lead: The nightingall with warbling throte Doth tug forth many a pleasant note, that makes the woods to ring: The fountaines cleere as Christall glasse, About the which, vpon the grasse The Nymphes do sit and sing: But let Eluinia turne her eies from all those sweete delights, Then doth continuall winter rage with stormy daies and nights. When that the freezing Northren windes disgrace The fragrant flowers, the stately trees and tall Of all their pride, and couereth euery place With flakes of snow, which neuer cease to fall: And nightingals their songs leaue for a space, And desert fieldes, that haue no greene at all: The daies are yrkesome short, and sad, The cold nights blow, as they were mad, With many a bitter blast: The cloudes as darke as any pitch, And thicke as lothsome mud in ditch, The aire do ouercast. But let Eluinia walke the fields or where it please her best, There merie springtide doth returne her praises to protest. If that the angrie heauens sometimes throw downe A fearfull lightning or some cruell thunder, The silly Shepherd, far from wood or towne, Begins to feare, to tremble and to wonder, And if the hayle fall thicke vpon the ground Like little stones, do beat and burst asunder The fruit, and leaues in euerie place, And spoiles the flowers of their grace, A strange, and pitious sight: The Shepherd runs away amaine, Leauing his sheepe vpon the plaine With swift and fearfull flight: But let Eluinia walke the fields her beautie euerie where Doth cleere the heauens, and rids the Shepherds hart from trembling feare. And if by chaunce I sing or pipe on hie, Vnder the shade of Elme or little hill, The Song thrush and the heauenly Larke replie Vnto my songs, with sweetest notes at will: And when the fresh and Western windes in skie Breath forth an aire, so pleasant and so still: When euerie ioy, and sweete content, And euerie day in pleasures spent Doth giue me new delights, And free from feare with liuely cheere In happines I spend the yeere, The pleasant daies and nights: But if Eluinia once do frowne, I am much more afraide Then if a burning lightning had my sences all dismaide. If that Diana goeth forth to chace The sauage beastes, with bended bow to tame, With troups of Nymphes that waite vpon her grace Whose thoughts chaste sports and exercise do frame: And with the same with great delight do trace The woods and lawnes in seeking out some game. Hamadriades and Napees faire With strowing Roses, do prepare The way before their Queene: The Nymphes that follow sweetly sing, And hils and dales with triumphes ring, And woods both fresh and greene: But if she come vnto the wood, where my Eluinia chaceth She makes her silent, quailes her pride, and beauties all disgraceth. And when her bodie whiter then the snow She washeth in the fountaine christall bright, If thither Cynthia should but chaunce to goe, And see those parts so daintie and so white, For shame she would cast downe her eies I know, And so depart, confounded at that sight: For in those fountaine waters cleere So braue a figure doth appeere, As like was neuer seene: So faire a face, such golden haire With rarest grace are shining there As like hath neuer beene: And bold Acteon if he did but see there alone, Had not beene turn'd into a Hart, but to a Marble stone. A thousand times my song I will reply thee, In euerie place where I doe feed my sheepe, But hence away, for pitie now go hie thee Vnto my Loue, and tell her how I weepe. See if thou canst but mooue her hart To some small pitie of my smart, And of my little rest: Go to my faire and fatall star, Tell her what wounding thoughts do war Within my painfull brest. O happie man if that thou mightest this grace of Fortune trie, To see Eluinia change her minde, or else thy selfe to die. [Diana, Loue, and my faire Shepherdesse] Diana, Loue, and my faire Shepherdesse, Did in the field their chiefest cunning trie, By shooting arrowes at a tree neere by, Whose barke a painted hart did there expresse: Diana stakes her beautie mercilesse, Cupid his bowe, Argia her libertie: Who shewed in her shot a quicker eie, A better grace, more courage, and successe: And so did she Dianas beautie win, And Cupids weapons, by which conquer'd prize So faire and cruell she hath euer bin, That her sweete figure from my wearied eies, And from my painfull hart her cruell bowe Haue stolne my life and freedome long agoe.</field>
