      <field name="fulltext">TO THE EARL OF HARROWBY, THE FOLLOWING SONNETS ARE RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY HIS OBLIGED SERVANT, THE AUTHOR. Torquay, May 4, 1835.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Raised, like a jewelled trophy, in mid-sky Orion shone, Jove's star o'erhung the West, Eastward, in all her beauty early drest, Venus proclaim'd the conquering Sun was nigh: Thousands of nameless Worlds stood glittering by; And myriads, streaming far beyond the rest From Heaven's low circuit to the polar crest, Were seen, through optic tube, by wondering eye: Nor yet unmarshalled, like a routed Host, In shining multitudes at random driven, Crowd they thro' some interminable coast; All, in the regions infinite of Heaven, In their appointed course, as Thou, Lord, know'st, Obey the voice of Thy commandâonce given. II. ON PRESENTING THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL WITH âSPECIMENS OF ITALIAN SONNETS WITH TRANSLATIONS.â Among the titles which thy worth commend To Fame's bright record, and the World's esteem, First to the grateful Muse, and dearest, seem The gifted Scholar and the Patron-friend: 'Tis thus invoked she woos thee to suspend All graver cares, and, by the Tuscan stream, In shades romantic wrapt, indulge the dream, Which to their votary's prayer the Sisters lend. Scipio and LÃ¦lius, as pleased Marcus tells, Would oft, when Senates closed, the hours beguile, Pacing the yellow sands in quest of shells. Now England's course is smooth, and no cloud lowers, Quit, noble Harrowby, the helm awhile, And stoop to Poesy's minuter flowers. III. Ye Stars of Heaven, that, through the veil of Night, Look mercifully down, ah! gaze ye not, With pity, on this dark sublunar spot, Whose good so soon was marred by evil's blight? Perchance, within your spheres' unfading light, Immortal Beings hold a godlike lot; Who never the command divine forgot, Nor feared their Maker's voice, nor shunned his sight: Or, are ye stationed in the wilds of space To welcome those, who Death have overthrown, And fit their vision for the blissful place? From glory on to glory fuller shown Our Guides, till we behold Him face to face, And, in His likeness, know as we are known. IV. To this fair Island, in the western sea, From green Devonia's vales I cameâto die; In vain the fondest care, serenest sky, Long had gone forth th' immutable decree: Long had I been resignedâYe, only, Ye, Who watched my slow decline with anxious eye, To Earth still bound me with affection's tye; For Love made known what sorrow yours would be: Yet mourn notâAll the shadowy scene must leave At morn or noon, ev'n those, who stay awhile, Count but a few brief hours, and sink at eve: Like Israel's Prince resume your wonted style; Ye cannot doubt my bliss, ye may not grieve, Whilst in your memory lives my dying smile. V. Though Alps in awful grandeur stood around, With all the wonders their deep bosoms hold, Summer's bright verdure, snow's eternal cold, Dark pine-clad steeps, and torrent-gulf profound; Still, like the Pilgrim, on sweet errand bound, Whose eyes with passing glance the scenes behold, Which realms of beauty to his view unfold, I sped with eager step tow'rds Latian ground: My fancy lingered round the imperial halls, Where she had made herself a shadowy home, By Tiber's banks, and Anio's waterfalls: My childhood's thought, my youth's desire, was Rome: Strangely I longed to walk within her walls, And worship God beneath his proudest dome. 1821. VI. Chief of the giant mountains! awful form! Alp! on whose brow, wreathed with eternal snows, Suns smite in vain, when radiant summer glows, And harvests ripen through thy valleys warm; Oft I behold thee girdled with the storm, Oft, when the Moon her quiet splendour throws O'er thy vast solitudes, and darkly shows The scars and ruins which thy sides deform. Thy summit pure, so free from earthly stain, Seems meet approach to that immortal state Where peace unclouded holds her starry reign: The Few who climb thee, with strange joy elate, Thus mingling with the skies, forget their pain, Like Pilgrims fresh-arrived at heaven's own gate. VII. Ocean! I love thee in thy boisterous mood, When thy strong billows wrestle with the land, Or, with high crest careering o'er the strand, Leap the dark cliff, and scare the sea-bird's brood: I love thee, Ocean, when by Zephyr woo'd Thy placid waters tremblingly expand, And his soft whisper greet with smiles, as bland As thy face wore, when God first call'd thee good. Yet most I love thee, when, from low-browed cave, I watch, as sheds the Moon the golden path, That leads to heaven across thy slumbering wave: But I abhor thee, when, in senseless wrath, Thou swallowest up the gentle, and the brave, In sight of home, and friends, that throng to save. VIII. Beauty! when intellectual charms are thine, And kindling features eloquently speak Soft sensibility, and temper meek, I fondly turn, and worship at thy shrine; But when these gifts, that make thee all divine, Ennoble not the soul, nor bloom of cheek, Nor radiant eye, nor skin as damask sleek, Shall win a single wreath from hand of mine. Nor mean my service, nor though chastened, cold; To gaze unseen, unknown, wakes more delight Than misers feel when brooding o'er their gold. Then the attempt to picture thee aright! To shape thy absent form in fancy's mould! Imagination takes no sweeter flight. IX. Passing th' enclosure where the dead repose, I saw, in sable weeds, a gentle pair Lingering with fond regard, at evening's close, Beside a little grave fresh-swelling there: Silent they stood, serene their thoughtful air; There fell no tear, no vain complaint arose; Faith seemed to prompt the unutterable pray'r, And to their view the eternal home disclose. Next Sabbath brought me where the floweret layâ Record of high descent the marble bore, Heir of a noble house, and only Stay; And these words gathered from the Bible's storeâ âThe Lord hath given, the Lord hath ta'en away, His holy name be blessed evermore.â X. They tell me, Boy, that, with too eager pace, I strain with thee up Learning's arduous steep, And by untrodden paths advance, nor keep The road, that gently rises from the base: 'Tis true, from height to height to loftier place, I lead thee on, and barriers overleap, Where others, by dull ways, obscurely creep, Nothing beholding of the glorious chase; Yet is thy watchful Father ever by, Ever he stretches back a helping hand, Informs thy steps, and bids thee fearless try; One effort more, and on the top we stand,â There, in the freshness of a purer sky, Range we at leisure through the flowery land. XI. They picture Death a tyrant, gaunt and grim, And, for his random aim, temper a dart Of bite so mortal, that the fiery smart Consumes, and turns to dust the stoutest limb. Thus dire to meet, yet shrink not they from him Who walk, by faith, in singleness of heart; The simply wise, who choose the watchful part, Nor let their eyelids close, or lamps grow dim. Nor always dark, and terrible his mien; As those, who by the couch the night-watch keep, Have known, spectators of the blessed scene, When friends, who stand around, joy more than weep, As, with hushed step, and smile of love serene, In the soft guise he comes of gentle Sleep. XII. Constance! though on the couch of sickness laid, Thy present ill with pictures of the past Is oft beguiled; so fresh the colours last In thy mind's mirror pure, at will display'd; For thou hast Alp and Apennine survey'd; Rome on her ruined throne of empire vast; Art's wonders, forms in mould of beauty cast, And nature, lovelier than herself, portray'd. Visions of Italy still charm thine eyes: Often, amid the gloom of sleepless hours, Thy chamber brightens with her happy skies; Her fruits hang golden, fragrant breathe her flowers; And tuneful, as the day in glory dies, The knell of evening chimes from convent towers. XIII. Lord! I would hunger after that blest food, Thirst after that life-giving draught of thine, And ever, if to will and do were mine, The one thing needful seek and only good; But ah! to interrupt her better mood How many Foes against my Soul combine; Foes, that, unless thy powerful arm divine Extend its aid, by me are ill withstood: Yet rich thy Promise is, faithful thy Wordâ âAsk, at my throne let all thy wants be told, And in due season shall thy prayer be heard.â The prayer, thy grace now prompts, hear, Lord, at length; Deliver me, as thou wert wont of old, And, in my weakness, glorify thy strength. XIV. Would I to healthful sounds reclaim my Lyre! I pierce the green wood to some flowery nook, There on sweet Spenser cast regardful look; He chastens old, and kindles new desire. Not more were wont the Muses to inspire Dreamers of old with draught from sacred brook Of Castaly, when strange emotions shook Their tuneful souls, as winds the trembling wire. From vain delights, and lap of slothful down, Bewildered thoughts, and soft infectious speech, Who would escape, must quit the impure town; Returning, where, beneath the white-armed beech, By valley's stream, or hillock's verdant crown, Her simple lesson Nature waits to teach. XV. Roused by the billow's melancholy dirge, I woke, as Night her sable banner furled; What time pale mists, in forms fantastic curled, Like spectral shapes, come flitting o'er the surge: Then, looking eastward, on the ocean's verge From the near sun I saw red flashes hurled; As rolls the pageant from the nether world, And from the waves the golden wheels emerge. Never of old did more portentous light Suspend the seaman's oar, when, like a pyre, Lemnos appeared at evening, kindling bright; Ratherâwhen, tasked by Jove in sudden ire, The God was labouring with his crew all night, On glowing anvils shaping forked fire. XVI. Expectant on the grass-crowned cliff we lay; The signal sounded, to the enamoured wind Three lovely barks their snowy sails unbind, And big with swelling canvas stretch away. Swans, on the bosom of calm inland bay, That, by some fear to sudden speed inclin'd, Urge the blue waters till they stream behind, Not swifter seem, or whiter-winged than they. Nor eager those, alone, who seek the prize; As in full theatre, the scene begun, Rank above rank attentive crowds arise: Aloud the Victor, when the goal is won, We greet, and with the vanquish'd sympathise; Heedless, perchance, how our own race be run! XVII. I never with such horror stood aghast, As when in lone Pompeii's silent street, I felt thy mighty pulse, Vesuvius, beat, And from thy jaws saw burst the fiery blast: Thunders were loud, and smoke in columns vast Mantled the air with darkness, and strange heat Warned the sad peasant from his vine-clad seat, As down the fruitful slope the red stream pass'd. I feared lest might return that deathful hour, When to their Gods for help the people ran, And there was none, in temple, nor in tower: And to my vision came the enthusiast man, Who perished in the breath of that foul shower, Nature's dread secrets obstinate to scan. Naples, 1822. XVIII. Oft Winter, Babbicombe, thy lonely shore Hath lashed, since, freighted with a laughing crew, Our bark along the marge of Ocean flew, And stirred with gentle keel thy pebbly floor: We recked not what the future had in store, Bright, as thy embayed waters, to our view The present smiled, for life and hope were new, And look of peace the far horizon wore. Landed, in happy groups we wandered free, Some ranged the woods, some 'thwart the deep blue air Walked the high cliff, and traced a wider sea. The rock our table formed, the turf our chair, Nor sad the guests beneath the whispering tree, For Youth and Innocence and Love were there. XIX. Friends, gentle Friends, how often I repeat The wish, that near my own your dwelling stood, Not proudly built, yet elegantly neat, On some green slope, by hill o'erlooked and wood: Thither I oft should turn my eager feet, There with pure joys divert the pensive mood, Nor idly trifle, precious time to cheat, But prompt, and prompted be, to mutual good. Happy, thrice happy those, who, ere their days Be spent, from wandering in vain shadows cease, And view serene, as fade life's evening rays, The brightness of a better world increase; Still onward led by Her, whose ways are ways Of Pleasantness, and all whose paths are Peace. XX. Chief splendour of the azure-vaulted sky; Thou from thy golden urn the softest ray Dost pour, refreshing the sun-wearied eye, And lighting fancy on her dreamy way: Bewildered in the beautiful display, Methinks that thou, and all the stars on high, For me alone usurp the throne of day, So still and voiceless all earth's creatures lie: Vain thought! how many commune with thee now, On sleepless couch, from out the prison's gloom, Amid lone wilds, and on the distant prow. Thou soothest those who weep beside the tomb, And fond hearts at thine altar breathe the vow, Dazzled with hope, and blind to future doom. XXI. Here, where the night-breeze moans like a distant knell, I would hold converse with my kindred dead, And shape them to mine eye, as when they fled To the pure clime where righteous spirits dwell: Imagination work thy mightiest spellâ My Sire appears, light, such as sun-beams shed On vernal showers, enwreathes his sainted head, He seems to sayâSon! guard thy Mother well. Sisters! ye too do leave your heaven awhile, For this brief moment surely were ye spared, To teach me how above the Angels smile: Brothers! with whom life's joys and pains were shared, I mark the import of that warning style, Lips never plainlier spake,ââBe thou prepared.â XXII. Past the grey tombs what space an arrow flies, The darkening road winds down a hollow glade, Romantic spot! and sweetly solemn made By over-arching trees of giant size: Above, Aricia's battlements arise, As on the branches of the lofty shade The town were based, with all its long parade Of domes and turrets basking in the skies. More shadowy depths and varied tints of green Not Vallombrosa clothe, here, Stranger, stay, And on thy tablet spread the sylvan scene: Nor charmed alone the prospect's fair array, Old memories my raptures flashed between, And peopled thick the silent Appian Way. 1822. XXIII. Pacing, as I was wont, on day of rest, Amid the Coliseum's awful round, From distant corridor there came a sound, As of a voice that published tidings blest: Along the vaulted way I forward press'd, And soon a group of dark-eyed Romans found, Intent and fixed, like men some spell had bound, The Preacher with such power their souls address'd. The words he spake, his gesture, and rapt look, Betokened one whom Heaven had rendered bold To ope the treasures of the sacred book. Methought the Shepherd visibly forsook Temples, where holy things were bought and sold, For two or three thus gathered to his fold. Rome, 1822. XXIV. Ere the wide waters on my view had smil'd, From inland vale, in sunset's shapeful hue, Oft Fancy traced their level line of blue, And pictured cliffs where golden clouds were pil'd; Often the Sea-birds' wail my mind beguil'd, I loved the boisterous home from which they flew; From out dark pines when winds loud murmurs drew, Methought I heard the waves in chorus wild. At length I blest a Brother's guiding hand, The goal was reached, and as I stood entranced, A new world viewing from the lofty land, Suddenâaround the precipice that veils The western sky, a warrior-ship advanced,â On the blue waste a Pyramid of Sails. XXV. Ye sacred Arks of Liberty! that float Where Tamar's waters spread their bosom wide, That seem, with towering stern and rampart side, Like antique castles girt with shining moat; Should War the signal give with brazen throat, No more recumbent here in idle pride, Your rapid prows would cleave the foaming tide, And to the nations speak with thundering note. Thus, in the firmament serene and deep, When summer clouds the earth are hanging o'er, And all their mighty masses seem asleep, To execute heaven's wrath and judgments sore, From their dark wombs the sudden lightnings leap, And vengeful thunders peal from shore to shore. XXVI. Is this the spot where Rome's eternal foe Into his snares the mighty legions drew, Whence from the carnage, spiritless and few, A remnant scarcely reached her gates of woe? Is this the stream, thus gliding soft and slow, That, from the gushing wounds of thousands, grew So fierce a flood, that waves of crimson hue Rushed on the bosom of the lake below? The Mountains that gave back the battle-cry, Are silent now, perchance, yon hillocks green Mark where the bones of those old warriors lie. Heaven never gladdened a more peaceful scene; Never left softer breeze a fairer sky To sport upon thy waters, Thrasymene! XXVII. Often, when standing fearful near the brink Of towering cliff, whose rugged brow o'erhung Some dark ravine, where solitary sprung A lovely flower, wild rose, or glowing pink, I've fondly gazed, until I ceased to shrink From the sharp edge, and could myself have flung To the low crevice, where the floweret clung, Though with my prize I down were doomed to sink. In this enchanting world of love and light Are forms a thousand times more sweet and fair, And precipices near, that more affright; Taught by another's perilous proof, beware, Nor lean too much on reason's vaunted might; Those only are secure, who gaze not there. XXVIII. I stood at gaze where the free hills arise, Whence rocks 'mid deepest solitudes are seen, And glimmering through dark foliage, the blue sheen Of Ocean stained with heaven's own sapphire dyes: Then into the deep air I raised my eyes; The stedfast dome was cloudless and serene, Fit roof to over-arch so fair a scene, For earth in loveliness vied with the skies. Enrolled, methought, among a happier race, I felt immortal moments as I said, Death finds no entrance here, and Sin no place: Then quick to mark where recent footsteps led, I saw One bending o'er the furrow's trace, And on his brow the primal sentence read. XXIX. My window's open to the evening sky, The solemn trees are fringed with golden light, The lawn here shadowed lies, there kindles bright, And cherished roses lift their incense high: The punctual Thrush, on plane-tree warbling nigh, With loud and luscious voice calls down the night; Dim waters, flowing on with gentle might, Between each pause are heard to murmur by. The book that told of wars in holy land, (Nor less than Tasso sounded in mine ears) Escapes unheeded from my listless hand. Poets, whom Nature for her service rears, Like Priests in her great temple minist'ring stand, But in her glory fade when she appears. Bolham, 1824. XXX. O Thou! whose golden reins curb steeds of fire, Blest be the rosy Hours that onward bring Thy glorious pomp, now Night with folded wing Hides in her cave, and heaven's pale host retire: Fresh from their flowery beds the gales respire, To rapture new awakes each living thing, Rivers run joyous, woods harmonious ring, As Earth, unveiling, shows her green attire. Now Ocean shines distinct, the bark unmoors; Flocks to the dewy mountains from the fold Go forth, the springing lark above them soars; And hopeful Man, as on thy state is roll'd, Welcomes the beam that o'er the cluster pours A deeper dye, and ripens fruits of gold. XXXI. Lived there beneath the earth in depths profound A Race, like us, with reason's light endued, Yet who, less privileged, had never viewed The sky, the ocean, and the emerald ground; Then were they sudden from these shades unbound, And led into this world, with wonders strewedâ As they the spacious theatre reviewed, How would the spectacle delight, confound! The sun, the azure sky, the floating cloud, The sea, woods, rivers, and the flowery sod, And each fair scene the beams of day unshroud: The star-pav'd heaven by shining planets trodâ With eyes in wonder rais'd, and rapture loud, Ah! would they not exclaim? a God! a God! XXXII. TO THE REVEREND CARRINGTON LEY, VICAR OF BERE REGIS, DORSET. Friend of my youth! whom time hath made more dear, Not evils, only, years, as they advance, Darkly unfold, witness the happy chance! That from such hateful distance brings thee near: Scenes long o'ershadowed brightly reappear; Again, perusing with enraptured glance The early pages of life's sweet romance, I taste the freshness of our vernal year. Haste, my retreat hath store of charms for thee, Sweet note of native birds, and by clear stream Trees, whose green arches often cloister me; Remembered books, awakening ancient theme,â Nor wants there wine, laid up for sober glee, When Grenville was installed our Chief supreme. Bolham, Tiverton. XXXIII. How oft maturer years are charmed with store Of scenes from glowing pages caught in youth, When words, like pictures, living colours wore, And fiction's impress was as strong as truth; The Red Sea! when the built-up waves down pour On Egypt's hostâamid the corn-sheaves, Ruth!â Or, Cadmus, portrayed in profaner lore Watching the growth of men from Dragon's tooth! In my ideal gallery appear Two trees, which I more fondly contemplate Than any my own hands have planted here; The Plane, that shaded Tully in debate, And Fig-tree, to returning warriors dear, That spread its branches near the ScÃ¦an gate. XXXIV. Columns, all statue-crowned, their deep files spread On either hand, whilst from twin fountains spring Waters, that beat the air with dewy wing, Then radiant fall upon their marble bed: To the majestic front thus proudly led, What pencil's force, what strong imagining Shall paint, as back the lofty gates they fling, The firmament of glory overhead. Fit emblem of the great Creator's deed, When heaven's blue concave crowned the mighty plan, And the first mortal earth's young verdure trod. The Nations here, forgetful of their creed, ExclaimâO noblest monument of man! O Temple worthy of the living God! Rome, 1822. XXXV. I may not taste the fragrant breath of Spring, And gaze upon her beauty, and caress The flowers embosomed with such tenderness, And her sweet advent not be heard to sing; When insects are abroad on gentle wing, And birds, melodious, throng the green recess, When rising joys all living creatures bless, And sounds of gladness through the valleys ring. Now Earth's redeemed from winter's icy chain, And buds and blossoms drink the sun-lit shower, And verdant fallows teem with infant grain, I too would feel heaven's renovating power, And on the true vine grafted, there remain A living branch, until the vintage hour. XXXVI. TO THE MEMORY OF SUSAN, VISCOUNTESS EBRINGTON. Death! thou hast laid a matchless victim low, And overwhelmed, by such untimely doom, The lordly hall and Peasant's bower in gloom, So many hearts are pierced by this one blow! Yet, blessed truth! though vanish'd from below, Her beauty lives, her gentle virtues bloom Imperishably fair beyond the tomb, Where the pure streams of life for ever flow. Adorned with every grace of form and mind, She perfected what nature fondly plann'd, And grew to be the model of her kind. When worth, like hers, retires at Heaven's command, To friend, or parent, grief is not confined,â We mourn for dead a Daughter of the Land. XXXVII. The tidings cameâmy Brother was no moreâ Heart-stricken, to the Palatine I went, There on a sculptured stone Time's hand had rent, I sat me down my spirit to restore: Friends there were none, They wept on Albion's shore; Yet each grey Fane, each aged Monument, Seemed on my sorrow feelingly intent: Such look of sympathy the Ruins wore. And Men, with whose high deeds the world yet rings, Appeared, as evening gloomed, and Conquerors pass'd With Nations in their train, and captive Kings; And voices, from that shadowy concourse vast, Whispering the vanity of earthly things Were heard, as flitted by the midnight blast. Rome, 1822. XXXVIII. Louisa! guarding still the name of Winn, Rememberest thou Devonia's vernal hue, Her orchards blooming flowery vales within, Her dewy skies, and sea of softest blue? Rememberest Greenway, and th' expanding view Of Dart's full waters, Becky's thundering din, And northward, where, oak-garlanded anew, Down from her mountain-lair career'd the Linn? That valley too, strange wilderness of stone, And the bold path hung midway from the surge, And sky-built crags, old Druids' misty throneâ These scenes remembered, I too may emerge Who gazed with thee, however dimly shown, Content, if seen within the picture's verge. XXXIX. 'Twas near the walls that gird th' imperial town, Where from a lonely Convent's still retreat I saw, whilst Tiber glowed beneath my feet, From heaven's illumined vault the Sun go down; The lofty Capitol, like burnished crown, Blazed on the City's brow,âeach hallowed seat, Each mournful relic of the perished Great, Seemed once more brightening into old renown; The Plain in purple haze lay slumbering deep, The giant arches, that bestrode it, shone A bridge of gold to blue Albano's steep. Man, here alas! for ages overthrown, With no gleam kindles, sunk in deathlike sleep, His ruin, Rome, is darker than thine own. XL. THE ROCK-WALK. A Spot, whose beauty ev'n from gainful haste Wins brief delay, long space enjoyed by those Who the slow walk repeat, or in repose Eye the blue waves, and sea-born breezes taste: Green swelling hills of Devon, foliage-traced, With cliffs romantic round bright waters closeâ Here blushes early, lingers late the rose, The myrtle here survives the leafy waste. Like isles pine-pinnacled the glassy deep O'ershadowing, when War's loud note alarms, Here England's battle-ships dread muster keep: The Peasant oft, so glory's service charms, Viewing the bannered squadrons from this steep, Joins the bold crew and dares the strife of arms. XLI. Season of bursting leaves! for many a day I've watched thy coming, and strict search have made Beside the tangled copse, and open glade, For the fresh charm of new-invested spray: Blest dropping clouds! mild warmth of brighter ray! At length the chestnut from the brown wood's shade Flings emerald gleams, along the lane's arcade Elms with green light illuminate my way: Yon Oak, where build the social birds and pair, Into rich foliage is swarming out, And sunward shineth with a golden glare. Ye tardy trees, that linger still and doubt, Unbind your leafy locks, the southern air Invites, and stranger cuckoo's mellow shout. XLII. As One, who in the battle's hot career Sees a loved comrade fall, yet onward goes Urged by the rapid war, and whelming foes, And, scarcely sighing, o'er him drops no tear; Thus I, when Death a brother struck, was near, Yet in such dread array came on fresh woes, That desperate borne to meet th' impending blows, Scarce a wild look I cast on one so dear. Now hath misfortune spent her angry store, And slow-recovering from the stunning shock At length the prostrate senses wake once more; Feeling returns, with deep remembrance sore Of treasure lost, upon the lonely rock I sit, and shipwrecked hopes and life deplore. January, 1826. XLIII. The gale that winged with fragrance softly blew, Now spread the sulphurous taint of death,âthe rill Tuneful and clear, was bloodstain'd now and still,â Banks trodden down, and blacken'd their green hue; Yet to this stream from adverse camps withdrew, To quench hot thirst, Warriors, with peaceful will; Rancour was soothed, and Pity's tender thrill Kindled in each rough breast emotions new. Like Knights of old, at close of battle fray, Each to the other courteous service lends, And hands are joined and vows exchanged that day: Sudden a voice of loud command ascends, âTo arms,â âto arms,ââthe battle moves, and they, Who strangers smote before, now smite their friends. XLIV. Psalm 119, v. 71. O ye! who through the vale of sorrow plod, Attend the words which Israel's prince declared, When God was wrath, nor his own servant spared, Till deep repentance won the approving nod. Yesâwhen we bend beneath affliction's rod, No more by beauty of the world ensnared, Vain Man at sight of coming judgment scared, Turns from his idols to the living God. Though pain excruciate, and death affright, Yet as the wasted body sinks, the soul Beholds eternal things with purer sight. Affliction! so my wandering steps control, That, tho' I pass with thee through darkest night, I may at dawning reach the heavenly goal. XLV. How silently on her smooth axle turns Th' unwearied Earth, bearing with rapid ease Waters of mighty rivers and broad seas, Whilst not a drop o'erflows their brimming urns! Naught hindered when the loud volcano burns; Alike unmoved by hurricane or breeze; Perish her infant flowers, or, aged trees, Bent on her errand all delay she spurns: By night, by day, still eager to fulfil Her task of ages, in a ceaseless round She moves, obedient to her Maker's will. Ah would that Man, on his brief journey bound, So kept his course, and, spite of transient ill, Thus unperturb'd a Traveller were found! XLVI. She grieved that her loved Season's pensive hue, Its colours sadly gay, so soon should fade, And she not seek, in thoughtful mood, the glade, Nor from grey steep the mellow landscape view: Others too grieved, that One, so fond and true, Marked not with them each sudden gleam and shade, The leaf's light fall, the stillnessâdeeper made By rustling breeze, or birds forlorn and few. O pure delight! when minds are well agreed, To commune thus with Woman, early taught In Nature's page devotedly to read: Lady, with theeâwho, in thy vernal hour, Like some heaven-favoured plant, art richly fraught With Wisdom's golden fruit, and Beauty's flower. XLVII. Had I the skill of Lawrence and chaste hues, Then would I, Lady, thy resemblance trace, And oft before mine eyes the portrait place, Nor trust alone to Memory and the Muse; Then others might thy countenance peruse, And say, when bending o'er th' expressive face,â To paint that tender look's peculiar grace The fondest words were vain that Poets use! Ah me! for neither Art brings full content, Sinceâthy mild voiceâhow were its sweetness told? And howâthy manner's gentle blandishment? Woman, thus precious, Genius' sons of old In visions saw, heaven-taught to represent Her, whose fond arms the holy babe enfold. XLVIII. Raise, raise, dear gentle Flower, thy drooping head, That gracious Heaven may open to thy view, Cheer with its beams, refresh thee with its dewâ Look up, dear gentle Flower, be comforted. Set in His garden, by His bounty fed, Whilst others by the way-side idly grew, In purer air, among the chosen few, Thou hast in strength and beauty flourished. âAh, say, how droop not, if, in that same bower, A loved one sink beneath such early doom, That grew with me in sunshine, and in shower.â Ere the full fragrance, and immortal bloom Of that fair world be Hers, dear weeping Flower, Thy loved One must be gathered to the tomb. XLIX. Proud One! I reckon thee thus highly placed At the Great Master's hospitable board, For other purpose than to wear and waste,â He claims thy service, claims to be adored: This homage paid, 'tis given thee to taste, To see o'er all thy works his blessing pour'd; Whilst those, who only to their pleasures haste, Shall pine amid th' abundance of their hoard. âAh, say, how serve him best, how best adoreââ A Brother, Sister see in all who grieve, And in thine own behold a common store: Who doeth thus shall thankfully believe His words, who all our sins and sorrows bore,â More blessed 'tis to give than to receive. L. Oh never, Lady, in the desert plain Did Pilgrim hail with such intense delight Green shade and fountain cool, as I the sight Of one whose friendship was my earliest gain: Blooming I left thee, 'mid the virgin train, Like some fair rose on stem of graceful height, Whose beauties open to the flattering light Of golden morn, and skies without a stain. Alas! not mine alone the saddened brow; Thine too with sorrow's cloud is overcast, And eyes that beamed with joy, are tearful now: Ah! let us hope that every storm is past, That voyaging abreast with gentle prow, We may the peaceful haven reach at last. LI. Time, I rejoice, amid the ruin wide That peoples thy dark empire, to behold Shores against which thy waves in vain have roll'd, Where man's proud works still frown above thy tide. The deep-based Pyramids still turn aside Thy wasteful current, vigorously old Lucania's temples their array unfold, Pillar, and Portico, in simple pride. Nor less my joy, when, sheltered from thy storms In earth's fond breast, hid treasure bursts the sod,â Elaborate stone in sculpture's matchless forms. Oft did I mock thee, Spoiler, as I trod The glowing courts where still the Goddess warms, And stern in beauty stands the quivered God. LII. Well I remember, on my youthful ear When first the solemn Hallelujahs fell; Through dim aisles roll'd the echoes, like the swell Of mighty waters when the winds career: Great was my transport, and sublimed by fear; High thoughts of those, who in God's presence dwell, Possess'd my soul, and Judgment, Heaven, and Hell As dread realities did now appear: And when the deep notes ceas'd, and evening gleamed, A voice serene amid the pillared gloom Of the Redeemer sang, and the Redeemed; Of Death, and Resurrection from the tomb; How the rejected One, and the blasphemed, Should in His glory come, and seal our doom. LIII. In healthânot rich, nor meanly poor, my state Is more than kinglyâno one envies me, For Nature's varied scenes to all are free, And in her paths I early stray and late. Contented stand I at another's gate, And gaze on fruits whose sweets untasted be, Walk 'mid his sheaves and share the reaper's glee, His barns are fill'd, whilst I congratulate. I feel the Love that wakes each vernal flower, That pours from secret urns the tuneful brooks, And gives to summer-suns their ripening power. Deep things I read in Autumn's thoughtful looks, And when the snow falls thick in darkening shower, How bright my chamber, and what friends my books! LIV. The Sonnets with the Initials C. L. are by a friend. THE EVENING STAR. A Gem upon the diadem of Night, Yon peerless Planet beams athwart the West. Is that thy dwellingâthat thy place of rest My Mother? dost thou bathe in the pure light By mortals unapproached, or with the bright And duteous Seraph hymnest thou? Oh blest In the companionship of Saintsâthe guest Of Heaven's Great King, triumphant in the might Of thy Redeemer! haply dost thou e'er Bend on this world of ours thy meek blue eye E'en as of yore 'twould gaze in ecstasy On yonder orb intent? what strife and care And sin doth meet thy vision! earthward then Look not, my Motherâhie thee home agen. 1830. C. L. LV. BIRDIE. Star of my life's pale eve! sweet Birdie, Child Of long soul-treasured hopes, how fondly dwell On thee thy Mother's thoughts and mineâhow swell Our hearts with joy to mark thy movements wild, So graceful in their gladness! We have smiled Albeit with awe, to hear thee lisping tell Thy golden day-dreams gushing from the well Of thy deep love-bright dreams and undefiled, And breathing all of heaven! Oh not of earth That pure and loving spirit that wakes in thee Each pulse and throb for her who gave thee birthâ Unfaltering trust and truthâfeelings that be Too calm for sorrow, too sedate for mirth Thy childhood's unreproved Idolatry! 1844. C. L. LVI. ON THE DEATH OF THE REV. HENRY ALFORD, M.A., FORMERLY FELLOW OF WADHAM COLLEGE, OXFORD. He's goneâmy guide at school, my college friendâ Scant space have I for utteranceâstill my heart, Fresh with old memories, yearneth to impart Such record as of Man is rarely penn'd. Wide fields with Wadham-gardens softly blend, His chamber view'd the scene: Here, books apart, The lone bird warbling, We, on Nature, Art, Oft mused, and truths of higher aim and end: Daily I mounted to his pleasant cell: But Time flowed on, and bore him out of sight: Not out of mind. A thousand tongues can tell, That, ever, when a Being pure and bright I traced, whose life became his faith so well, Thou, Alford, wert my theme and my delight. 1852. LVII. AFTER READING âEUSEBIUS,â B. V., CH. I. Theirs was the living faith, heroic breast, Who, when the rack no yielding cry had wrung, To the fierce flame or foul hyÃ¦na flung, Still their Lord's name, meek sufferers, confest. O noble army of Earth's Holiest! From whose free blood the Church to ripeness sprung, Well may we read your story, conscience-stung, Who, what ye earn'd, inheritâdangerous rest; Well shrink ashamedâon whom the morning's chill Or mid-day heat strikes like a Martyr's pain, If summon'd some small duty to fulfil. Gold, easy gift, without a muscle's strain Now wins a Martyr's praise, and win it will, In days when death is loss, and life is gain. LVIII. TO L. L. Three lustres, my beloved, have well nigh past Since that dear time when holy vow and ring Gave thee to me a Bride, and from their wing Years as they fly new blessings o'er us cast. Witness our children, not the least nor last, Health on their cheekâhow bright hath been the spring Of their young livesâhow glad its blossoming! Lapp'd in thy sheltering love from sorrow's blast! Then kneel with me, sweet Mother! while we bless, With thoughts devout and lowly thankfulness, His Name, who grants us all that heart can crave. Together pray His Holy Spirit may still Ourselves and these our treasures guard from ill, For the dear sake of Him who died to save. 1851. C. L. LIX. Ne'er wa dream So like a waking; in pure white robes Like very sanctity she did approach. That Voice! was it an Angel's? Ah, full well I knew itâ'twas âa sound that could not die.â âFather,â it cried, and still that gentle cry My listening ear holds captive to the spell. What lips, save thine, beloved, could syllable That word with so sweet power, by mystic tie To bind me to thy precious memory, Deep in my heart of hearts henceforth to dwell! Though but in dreams as now, oh let me hear Once more that voice, blest Spirit, for of Heaven Its music breathes, and love, Heaven's atmosphere. Of rest and peace it speaksâof man forgivenâ Of tearless eyesâbright robesâwhite waving wings, And Seraph harpings to the King of kings. May, 1855. C. L. LX. Dollond, a lover of thy name and skill Would fain that wonder-working tube possess With which, if any, thou hast power to bless The nightly gazer and his dreams fulfil. 'Twas thy great ancestor who hoping still, Where Newton's self despair'd, by patient stress Work'd the dark problem, till all colourless Flow'd the pure rays as water from the rill. Many incumbent on ancestral fame Lean proudly idle on a gather'd store, No kindred sympathies their breasts inflame; But thou, to old renown hast added more, And, reverential, well upheld a name, To grateful science dear on every shore. LXI. TO THE REV. W. R. DAWES, F.R.A.S. Not better to the plain-encamp'd Chaldee, Or him who from MycenÃ¦'s palace-wall Watch'd nightly for the news of Ilion's fall, Were known the stars of heaven than, Dawes, to thee: Awe-struck they view'd the glittering canopy; Whilst thou, with Science, handmaid at thy call, Turnest thy mind-illumined eye on all, Descrying systems link'd in harmony. Who first saw Saturn's dim mysterious ring? Who, when huge spots darken'd the day-star's face, Their changes mark'd, and mighty eddying? Grateful the eager moment I retrace, When we, as oped the Dome with upward spring, Sounded the shining depths of boundless space. Observatory, Haddenham, 1860. LXII. THE TWO GARDENS. Too precious rosebuds in our gardens grew, And train'd and tended with untiring care They fill'd the eye with beauty and the air With fragranceâwater'd by the gracious dew Of love divine, their blossoms oped and threw A charm o'er all who watch'd them blooming there; And youth and age breathed blessings and a prayer On their young heads with loving hearts and true: And one was chosen by a courtly guest, Sweet flower!âthe halls of nobles to adorn, And, like a gem, to sparkle on his breast; And one was gather'd by the Angel Death With tenderest hand, and borne aloft to wreathe The brow that wore for us the mocking thorn. 1856. C L. LXIII. BARON. Like Autumn leaves our pets drop one by one From out our sight, as we ourselves draw near Life's final goal.âForgive, then, if a tear Bedew the sod where sleeps a favourite gone. His form was faultlessâtruth, love, duty shone In his mild eye.âStill ringing in my ear A voice, that voice, sounds âBaron, Baron, here!â And he, in wildest mood, would heed its tone. Is there no heaven for such fidelity? Like that wherein the untutor'd Indian dreamt âHis faithful dog might bear him company,â From all the torturing ills of life exempt? Say, what is instinct,âwhat the immortal mind Of mortal man? what conscience? how defined? 1861. C. L. LXIV. Man in the image of Jehovah made, Man, born to love his kind, yet bred to hate,â Is Man become a burthen to the state, Toil-spent to sink and wither in the shade? What? has the earth withholden the green blade? Falls there no more the early rain and late? Hath the brown fallow ceased to vegetate, And flocks to bring forth thousands in the glade? Ah no,âboon Nature, liberal as of old, From her full bosom yields increase of food, Herds without number, corn a hundred-fold. 'Tis Man alone that hath her aim withstood, To the low lust of gain insatiate sold, And dead to every sense of brotherhood. 1844. LXV. How manifold are thy deep wonders, Lord, Night after night into thy heavens I gaze, And watch as circling through the starry maze The golden planets move in sweet accord. Oh! blasphemy of Fools! oh! thought abhorr'd! That would the eternal characters erase, Which to the creature show in living blaze Creative Wisdom, and a God record; Yea, characters, that they who run may read, Writ everywhere, throughout each land and sea, In telling of His Power are all agreed: Yet nought on earth beneath, in heaven above, Declares, like Jesus, sinner, given for thee, A God of Holiness, a God of Love. LXVI. THE ARBOR VITÃ. Four Decades, thou, in sunshine and in rain, Close by my threshold a tall sentinel Hast stood;âwhen first I crossed it, thou canst tell Of home's late severed ties how keen the pain! But hope returnedâthose fond regrets were vain, Charm'd by new scenes, I learnt to love the swell Of Bere's brown heaths, while to my lonely cell Came friends, alas! who ne'er can come again: And well, dear tree, thy vigil thou hast kept; Hast seen how oft we've joyed, how seldom wept, Seen kindred, brothers, parents, children, wifeâ The loved and loving up our pathway tread; Are they not nowâthe living and the deadâ In one all gathered round The Tree of Life? 1861. C. L. LXVII. THE CLIMBING BOY AND PRIMROSES. Black as an Ethiop with his sack and brush A tiny boy came sauntering down the lane, What time the young spring suns and dewy rain Ope'd the fresh primrose buds: blithe as the thrush That carolled lustily in yonder bush He whistled, while the flowers he plucked amain; Each like some gem of price to him was gain,â Toil had not quenched his spirit's joyous gush. âTo the shorn lamb God tempereth the wind,â Oh Nature, gentle Mother! Thou art kind To all thy childrenâe'en thy abject ones Bask in the sunshine of thy radiant smile, Breathe thy rich odours, list thy soothing tones, And life of half its weary load beguile. 1851. C. L. LXVIII. TO THE MEMORY OF GEORGE AND ANN BODLEY, NONAGENARIANS, OF WITHLEIGH GOODMAN, TIVERTON. A farm lies mapp'd upon the green hill-side, Once by a yeoman own'd, of no mean name, But from a worthy Knight deriv'd, the same Who the Bodleian's learned store supplied. Hither, when Blundell's school-gates open'd wide, And I was free to go, none ever came More welcome to the good man and his Dame, In summer or at merry Christmas tide. Dear scenes of cheerful toil! at morn's first glow I follow'd the blithe Mower to the vale, And watch'd as sank the grass in lengthening row. Singing, the maiden fill'd her foaming pail, And when the silent fields were white with snow, Echo would mock the quick beat of the flail. LXIX. Although grown old in wondering, still the sight Of the young moon, lit from the sun anew, Strikes as a fresh creation on my view, Another splendour added to the night. Rounded to fulness now, and now less bright, Shrinking, as Ocean shrinks, from stranded crew, Whose sails flap idly since the tide withdrew, The planet seems to ebb and flow with light. To our own fortunes, linked by some dark chain, We, fellow voyagers, to bring her near, And her dim features scan, our vision strain, Eager to know if on her spotted sphere, With hill-top rough, and smooth with golden plain, Dwell beings like ourselves, of hope and fear. LXX. THE FIRST LEAF OF THE ALBUM. Urania's Gift! Ah let it be A rich and teeming treasury Of bright thoughts innocently wild And playful as thyself, sweet child! Whence thou may'st summon at command As from thy own loved fairy-land Full many a legend, many a lay Of Sylph or Mermaid, Sprite or Fayâ Art's loveliest forms, and flowers of Song, Sparkling like gems its leaves among, âAnd every thing that pretty binâ Greet thee whene'er thou look'st therein. October, 1848. C. L. LXXI. THE LAST LEAF OF THE ALBUM. Urania's Gift! When first the virgin leaves The unspotted page unfolded, Youth's sweet days Were opening too:âthen all that art displays Of bright and beautiful, or fancy weaves In her capricious mood, or wit conceives, Was culled to please our darling; now the fays Have fled, the song has ceased, hushed are the lays Of our mute harpsâo'er her the Cypress grieves. Oh! how we loved her! every living thing To her caress with looks of love replied. What made thee, faithful Sport! lie listening Upon her grave as though she had not died? For brutes, more blest, as holy Minstrels sing, See Angel forms to our dull sense denied. 1861. C. L. LXXII. IN MEMORY OF THE HONOURABLE JOHN ST. CLAIR, A.B., WHO DIED IN 1842, AGED 21, AT CH. CH., OXFORD, AND LIES BURIED IN THE CATHEDRAL. Ah, say, why weep for one thus early blest, Fond Parents, Sisters fond? your tears are due If for yourselves ye weepâto mortal view Fall'n is the pillar of your earthly rest. But he, dear Saint, is Heaven's immortal guest: After a rapid voyage and dangers few, Steering by that one living light and true, The port, that ye still seek, he hath possest. Oh mercy rare! to reach before life's noon The goal, so oft denied to fervent prayer, Angels alone can estimate the boon. And ye who pass his tomb or linger there, Musing on one whose summons came so soon, Live as he liv'd, to die as died St. Clair. LXXIII. I thank them for their work, the pious dead, Who, strong in faith, this glorious pile begun, Each sire, through ages, leaving to his son, The growing walls till all was perfected. Here, in these echoing aisles sublime, be read The Scriptures, here God's grace be sought and won, Not in that curtain'd nook, as if to shun The gaze of men, and stint the living bread. Summon thy Preachers, the eloquent and good, And from the lanes and from the highways brought At thy wide gates let in the Multitude; Nourish thy Children, as a Mother ought, And thou shalt stand, as Church hath rarely stood, Based on the love of those whom thou hast taught. LXXIV. MORETON CHURCH REPAIRED, 1847â8. âAnd shall the Ark of Godâ cried Israel's King âIn curtains bide, while I in cedar dwell?â My gilded beams and roofs vermilion well A curse upon my Father's house might bring. Louder and loftier yet he sweeps the stringâ âThou, whom the Heaven of Heavens, or deepest Hell May not containâO God! Thou need'st no cell Reared by man's hand for Thy inhabiting.â Yet David scorned to offer to The Lord Of that which cost him noughtâpunctual he weigh'd E'en the last shekel to the Jebusite. Nor would'st thou, Frampton, see thy God adored With hearts less meek, because thy hands have paid In earthly dross for a more costly rite. 1849. C. L. LXXV. THE PRINCE OF WALES AT THE TOMB OF WASHINGTON. Beneath embowering shades on Vernon's height Columbia's darling son, her hero sleeps; A pilgrim there, borne o'er the Atlantic deeps, Young Albert stands, Heir of Britannia's might. Nought recks he now of that unholy spite 'Twixt Sovereign and subject, or the heaps Of kindred slain on Saratoga's steeps In deadlier feud than that fell Theban fight: Himself the child of Freedom, to the free He brings a graceful Tributeânigh the stone That seals the Patriot's grave he plants a treeâ Emblem of friendship pledged, of passions gone, Homage of Fatherland to Liberty Won by thy sword, immortal Washington. 1860. C. L. LXXVI. Lady, would'st thou be blest as Britain's Queen, And worthily the lofty task fulfil, Upholding good, discountenancing ill, And thus bear golden fruit on stem so green; Shun, shun the Flatterer, whose lips unclean, Poison of asps in honied words distil, Whose wiles with Pleasure's phantom cheat the will, Wreathing with flowers the gulf that yawns unseen; And know thyselfâhence is thy weakness known, Thy want of other help, want best supplied By earnest kneelings at the heavenly throne: Thus shalt thou walk serene by virtue's side, At once the Nation's Ruler and thine own; Yeaâto thy very Counsellors a Guide. 1837. LXXVII. Lady, I fear to check the joyous flow Of happiness that warms thy youthful heart, To make from those bright eyes the moisture start In tears of pity for such depth of woe; But thou art worthy as a Friend to know What myriads of thy people feel the smart Of want and sickness, whom the threatening dart Of death would gladden by a speedier blow. The praise of thousands, happier in their store, And blessings from fair lips have followed thee And thy good Albert to each princely door; Taste now a higher pleasure, godlike be, 'Tis thy prerogative, and for the poor Wake with thine own a Nation's sympathy. 1843. LXXVIII. TO THE REVEREND CHARLES STRONG. âFriend of my youth.â Thy earliest Muse to me Such title gave, dear Strongâand now that name Old and too partial friend, thou well may'st claim. When fresh from Blundell's seat, a stripling, free In Balliol's courts to gather from the tree Of classic lore the precious fruits I came, Thou wert my counsellor and guide, to fame And her steep path aye beckoning cheerily. And still in thy own Wadham's chamber, oft Waked by thy hand the organ's solemn swell And Dunsford's merry laugh, and Templer's soft And winning accents are remembered well. And Eagles, âFancy's Child,â too soon inurned Alas! by us how loved, how deeply mourned! 1860. C. L. LXXIX. BEATRICE CENCI AND CHARLOTTE CORDAY. Two lovely forms I picture as they stood Clad in their grave-clothes,âone a parricide, And one a murderessâeach her hand had dyedâ This in Marat'sâthat in a father's blood. Yet were they maidens both of gentlest mood: And who their victims? miscreants who defied God's laws and man's, whose crimes to heaven cried For vengeance,âmonsters of hell's foulest brood. Tears for the Cenci!âWho shall say that she Was guilty when with calm cold eye she dared The rack and axe, rather than worse disgrace. And thou, proud France! where was thy chivalry Thy old renown? A girl it was that bared Her arm to hurl thy tyrant to âhis place.â 1851. C. L. LXXX. TO MY DEAD PAROQUET. Well may I mourn, nor blush to own my woe, Now death hath silenced that half-human note, Marring, sweet bird, thy green and golden coat And neck, where rainbow hues would come and go. Dear Poll, I never shall forget theeâno, Charms, beyond graceful shape and tuneful throat, Made me, a Stoic deem'd, so strangely doat, And still bid tears, as I caress thee, flow; For thou wert fond, intelligent and true, And shamedst many of the lordly race Who reason boast, but friendship never knew. Methinks thy Being to some happy place Will yet ascend, where love shall have its due, For God is love, and wants not power or space. Dawlish, August 30, 1838. LXXXI. Joys, meteorlike, oft flatter us, and fade: Of moments brief and bright, I fain would tell, Which, Memory treasures in her sacred cell, Like gems, for frequent view, in casket laid. 'Twas Juneâon sunny lawn and leafy shade We gazed from open window, with faint swell Sighed the soft air, breathing the odorous smell Of flowers that richly gentle care repaid. Last seen, the blooming Mother was a child; Me she remember'd not, but well, my bird: At this two little ones looked up and smiledâ Dear names of Friends entombed from me she hearsâ The Past return'd, the heart's deep fount was stirr'd And love, that slept, awoke bedew'd with tears. Worth, Sussex, 1852. LXXXII. Sir Thomas Aclandâdear familiar name! Ill-changed for lordly title,âyet most due, If Britain's weal kept manfully in view, Pure life, ancestral worth, build up a claim: Through town and hamlet long hath his fair fame Flourished a household themeâif tidings flew Of his approach, all hailed, good men and true, The Bayard of the West sans fear, sans blame: For of her love though many worthy be, Still ever in Devonia's heart and eye Of all her sons foremost and first was He. To ease well earned we yield thee with regret; Bright was thy morn, calm be thy evening sky, Thou chivalrous, thou grand old Baronet! 1857. LXXXIII. IN MEMORY OF CHARLES HOARE, ESQ., TO WHOM LUSCOMBE OWES ITS BEAUTIES, AND DAWLISH A DEBT OF LASTING GRATITUDE. Thankful I walk, and happy then, amid The dark files, Luscombe, of thy solemn trees, Or, 'neath high-blossoming magnolias hid Inhale the fragrance of the fitful breeze. O blest retreats, that welcome fondly bid To thoughtful minds, and profit while ye please, Deeply I feel, if Pilgrim ever did, The healthful influence of scenes like these. How liberal He, whose taste, creative, made Rude Nature smileâwith blushing beauty stored The verdant slope, and shaped the hollow glade. Well may the grateful strain to him be poured; For here, Man seems, so charms the dreamy shade, To Eden and to Innocence restored. LXXXIV. THOMAS DRUMMOND, ESQ., FORMERLY UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR IRELAND. Drummond, on state affairs with eye so keen, Perhaps some thought religion might be cold In that full breast, whereas she made thee bold And thy love quicken'd for the island green. 'Twas not thy wont on arm of flesh to lean, Faith in the crucified was thy stronghold; And that thou gather'd wert into His fold, Let thy life witness and thy death serene. No need hast thou of pillar proudly placed, Nor words that friendship's partial pen indites, Whose memory on a nation's love is based. On some broad living rock 'mid Erin's heights, Thine own in giant characters be tracedâ Know ye have duties, Sirs, as well as rights. LXXXV. ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE FIRST VOLUME OF âARIOSTO.â Rose, I would copy from the olden time, When deeds of courtesy and love prevailed, And none did win the Muses, but was hailed By all their sacred sons with grateful rhyme. For thou hast not mis-spent thy youthful prime, Nor to th' Hesperian regions vainly sailed, Like Him who first the fleece's guard assailed, Thou, too, bring'st treasures from the Sun's own clime. May prosperous gales still breathe upon thy way, And cheering thousands crowd the fading shore, Eager to catch again thy jocund lay. Orpheus, high-seated on thy gallant prow, Shall echo from his harp unwonted lore, Whilst I fresh bays will gather for thy brow. LXXXVI. âNow,â said Mrs. Blencowe, âyou have heard the fate of my daughter Frampton's Bullfinch, go and write a Sonnet upon it.â A gentle Dame, fond of her little bird, Summon'd a skilful Artist to pourtray Its tiny shape, that, pictured, it might stay When the soft warble should no more be heard. The Painter came, the creature scarcely stirr'd, For one was near who watch'd each new display The pencil wrought, till drest in plumage gay The favourite to the tablet was transferr'd. Ah, me! a vase stood by, wherein were dipp'd The vermeil tints, hither poor Bully flew, And all unseen the tainted water sipp'd. Caught to the breast which still in death it knew, There droop'd it, like a flower untimely nipp'd, And dying chirp'd what seem'd a fond adieu. LXXXVII. MISS HOLFORD, AUTHOR OF âWALLACE,â âMARGARET OF ANJOU,â AND OTHER POEMS. It chanced in Winter that I shelter'd me In a mild southern vale, where dwelleth one Who in her youth had, harping, waked a tone That rang thro' Britain's Isle, from sea to sea. Wallace, like his own mountains, bold and free, The Hero was that her first raptures won; Next, Margaret! wandering with thy princely son, She sought a Heroine, and sang of Thee. What tho' be quenched the lightning of her eye, What tho' the Harp that to the northern blast Gave such wild music, hush'd, unsmitten, lie. Shall we not honour her for triumphs past, Joy with her joy, and answer sigh with sigh, And, loyal, smooth her pillow at the last! LXXXVIII. TO T. MERIVALE, ESQ., ON BEING PRESENTED WITH HIS COLLECTED POEMS. Ere Merivale, in our autumnal day We met, from thy clear page, I learnt thy mind, And needed none to whisper he is kind, Of temper chivalrous, and wisely gay: All this and more, applausive, I could say, Descant on taste, from classic source, refined, Wit, feeling, harmony with grace combined, And thoughts that speak Religion's lofty sway. Would that thy Dante's wish, were granted me! Smooth bark, bright waters and at will to roam With a few genial friends adorn'd like thee: Meanwhile, tho' distant from thy hearth my home, Still, in green shade, or by our pleasant sea, I commune with thee in each cherish'd tome. Dawlish, 1840.</field>
