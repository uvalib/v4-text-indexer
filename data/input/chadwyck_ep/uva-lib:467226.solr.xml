      <field name="fulltext">ALL HALLOW'S EVE Basil Menzies Brian Percy Brian Tearfully sinks the pallid sun. Menzies Bring in the lamps: Autumn is done. Percy Nay, twilight silvers the flashing drops; And a whiter fall is behind. Brian And the wild east mouths the chimney-tops, The Pandean pipes of the wind. Menzies The dripping ivy drapes the walls; The drenched red creepers flare; And the draggled chestnut plumage falls In every park and square. Percy Nay, golden garlands strew the way For the old triumph of decay. Basil And I know, in a living land of spells— In an excellent land of rest, Where a crimson fount of sunset wells Out of the darkling west— That the poplar, the willow, the scented lime, Full-leaved in the shining air Tarry as if the enchanter time Had fixed them deathless there. In arbours and noble palaces A gallant people live With every manner of happiness The amplest life can give. Percy Where? where? In Elfland? Menzies No; oh no! In Elfland is no rest, But rumour and stir and endless woe Of the unfulfilled behest— The doleful yoke of the Elfin folk Since first the sun went west. The cates they eat and the wine they drink, Savourless nothings are; The hopes they cherish, the thoughts they think Are neither near nor far; And well they know they cannot go Even to a desert star: One planet is all their poor estate, Though a million systems roll; They are dogged and worried, early and late, As the demons nag a soul, By the moon and the sun, for they never can shun Time's tyrannous control. The haughty delicate style they keep Only the blind can see; On holynights in the forest deep, When they make high revelry Under the moon, the dancing tune Is the wind in a cypress tree. They burn the elfin midnight oil Over their tedious lore; They spin the sand; and still they toil Though their inmost hearts are sore— The doleful yoke of the restless folk For ever and ever more. But could you capture the elfin queen Who once was Cæsar's prize, Daunt and gyve her with glances keen Of unimpassioned eyes, And hear unstirred her magic word, And scorn her tears and sighs, Lean would she seem at once, and old; Her rosy mouth decayed; Her heavy tresses of living gold, All withered in the braid; In your very sight the dew and the light Of her eyes would parch and fade; And she, the immortal phantom dame, Would vanish from your ken; For the fate of the elves is nearly the same As the terrible fate of men: To love; to rue: to be and pursue A flickering wisp of the fen. We must play the game with a careless smile, Though there's nothing in the hand; We must toil as if it were worth our while Spinning our ropes of sand; And laugh and cry, and live and die At the waft of an unseen wand. But the elves, besides the endless woe Of the unfulfilled behest, Have only a phantom life, and so They neither can die nor rest— Have no real being at all, and know That therefore they never can rest— The doleful yoke of the deathless folk Since first the sun went west. Percy Then where is the wonderful land of spells, Where a crimson fount of sunset wells, And the poplar, the willow, the scented lime Tarry, full-leaved, till the winter-time, Where endless happiness life can give, And only heroic people live? Basil We know, we know, we spinners of sand! In the heart of the world is that gracious land; And it never can fade while the sap returns, While the sun gives light, and the red blood burns. LAMMAS Herbert Percy Sandy Ninian Percy A health, in cider, golden, racy, rough— The harvest and the harvesters! Sandy I drink In amber spirit that enshrines the heart Of an old Lothian summer. Percy Summers old And Gules of August!—to their memory I drink, and to the memory of those Who wielded shining sickles. Forth they went, The gaunt and ragged heralds of the morn: Before them spread the sighing leagues of grain; Behind, the tardy sun arose and struck All day on men and women obstinate Against the stubborn ranks, the golden horde: Silent and set, as their long-sworded sires Who fought the crashing rollers on the strand And stared athwart the ocean wistfully Into the moaning storm, the reapers reaped: And they grew lean; and the sun burnt them black: A sea of living gold poured round their feet And rose in crested shocks; still and anon The whetstone shrieked against the curving blade. I drink the swarthy harvesters of old! Herbert To them all honour! But I also drink The merry singing wheels that lighten toil. Sandy And drive men into cities where they rot! Nor do they lighten toil— Ninian A truce to this! Let us see things and say them. Why debate? Sandy Debate? The sergeant-major of the tongue! Rather we should invite his discipline. Percy Well said, indeed! It is this same Debate That overmasters armies; that distils From rancorous commotion amity; It is the proof, sifter and alkahest Of all opinion, and the ordeal keen Of knowledge, reason and intelligence; The arbiter of right; the only source, Camp, castle and estate of liberty. The sword did never yet perpetuate The work it reared—too sharp a trowel, still With bloody mortar building on the sand. The word alone endures; but prophecy Being now invalid, we exalt Debate. Sandy The blare of personal and party aims In parliaments and journals seems indeed No substitute for Sinai; but it serves: And from the vehement logomachy Of interest and cabal, something humane At happy intervals proceeds. Ninian How now! ‘Something humane at happy intervals!’ A meagre output for your demiurge! Percy Debate, like every energy divine, Careless of centuries, elaborates Events effectual for eternity. The cavillers, impatient of delay, Like little boys that violate the earth To see if seedlings sprout, resent the mode, When they descry the immaterial Advancement in a decade; but we know, We, ponderers devout of secular years, How this most tedious Cyclops, this Debate, Laborious long in darkness and distress, Hammered and forged the adamantine chains That shackle tyranny, and now begins To smelt the ore from which shall yet be wrought A kingly crown for every child of man. Ninian I see no hope in wrangling. Nations pass From panic into panic; all men seem Fools or fanatics. Percy Well? ... Proceed; discuss. Ninian Not I; for now you put me on my guard Sometimes when I forget myself I talk As though I were persuaded of the truth Of some received or unreceived belief; But always afterwards I am ashamed Of such lewd lapses into bigotry. Percy Intolerantly tolerant, I say! Sandy This is debauchery: defend yourself! Ninian I cannot; I have tried it many a time, And always failed, because the thing I say Seems not more just than that which I deny; Nor would I if I could, because to me It now appears inept to take a side. I know that silence would become me best, And I endeavour to be quiet. Sandy Oh! Ninian Indeed I do.... Now I shall say no more. Herbert Why do you take offence so readily? Ninian I am not well: I am haunted. Lo, I stand On Arthur's Seat. The chill and brindled fog That plumed the Bass and belted Berwick Law, That hung with ghostly tapestry the stones Of bleak Tantallon, from the windy Forth, Noiseless and dim, speeds by the pier of Leith, And by Leith Walk, its dreary channel old, To flood the famous city, Edinburgh. Then, like the spectre of an inland sea By wanton sorcerers troubled and destroyed, It foams with whitening surges through the vale, The fair green hollow over Salisbury Crags; And rises clasping every gentle slope, Uneven scar, and fairy-girdled knoll, Till with the hungry passion of the dead It hugs the high earth, frantic to supply Its own lean misty ribs, and live again Terrestrial, with the mountain for a soul. I stand and watch. The fog begins to ebb; And sunset weaves of all the waning wreaths A veil of lace, investing goldenly The rock-piled castle—plinth and monolith Of ruby deep and dark in soaring groups; The Monument aflame with chrysolite; St Giles's garland-crown studded with gems. A bell rings faintly: curled and braided smoke O'erhangs the humming Canongate, and flings Dusky festoons that wither as they fall About the wasted towers of Holyrood. In front the burnished disc of day descends The ample crimson west; behind, the night In silent legions troops into the air.— Masses of vision overwhelm me thus: I am haunted by the heavens and the earth— Darkness and light; and when I am addressed I answer from the point, or petulantly, Or say the opposite of what I would, And am most awkward, helpless, and forlorn. Wherefore I shun the company of men, Not fearing them, but fearful of myself; Surely to strive to please and still to fail Is to be wretched in the last degree. Sandy Then do not strive to please: contemn contempt, And trust yourself. Ninian But I mistrust myself: A word, a glance, a cloud, a beam of light, A perfume from its orbit shakes my soul. Sandy This weakness comes because you look without. Ninian I look without: you look within: what then? You are possessed; I, obsessed: that is all. I am besieged by things that I have seen: Followed and watched by rivers; snared and held In labyrinthine woods and tangled meads; Hemmed in by mountains; waylaid by the sun; Environed and beset by moon and stars; Whispered by winds and summoned by the sea. Herbert What do you note now? Ninian By a Kentish road, Across the down where poles in ricks repose, Delivered from the burden of the bines, And golden apples on their twisted boughs Illumine ancient orchards, descend, Watching and wondering to the Medway's bank. The alder and the hazel dip their leaves; The grass-green willow shakes; the spiny thorn, Embossed and lustrous with its load of haws, Shines in the water like a burning bush; And broad and deep, muttering outlandish things, The heavy river rolls its umber flood. Convolvuluses overhang the brink, Pallid or watchet-hued, and still as bells That in a trance imagine tuneful chimes Of virtue to enchant a moonlit mere. On river lawns with emerald velvet spread The ewes sedately browse the three-piled nap. A distant clang of shouts and laughter rings Across the valley from the gleaming tents Of sunburnt hoppers at their evening meal; And fainter voices from the roadside inn Echo about the air, and dwell and die. Crowned by the yellow oasthouse from whose cowl Banners and scarfs of fleecy smoke hang out, And busked with serried, tawny-clustered vines, Far-reaching slopes lean up along the sky. The drowsy wind touches a fitful stop; The Medway mutters dreaming as it rolls; In bronzing brakes and thickets deeply choired Autumnal tokens birds at leisure pipe; While the sun, shut within a donjon high Of massive cloud, through secret loopholes flings His moted beams that quiver visibly Broadcast; or seem ethereal lances, stacked By the celestial watchmen who patrol The world at night, and on their silent rounds Move to the ghostly music of the spheres. Herbert And whence comes this obsession? Ninian Hark! Behold! The floor is flooded with the tide. I lounge Upon a shingle bolster. Dimly seen Beyond the weathergleam a pennon'd mast, A drift of smoke, hover and disappear; And in the midst dark sails of mackerel boats Over a reach of water, brown as tan, Dance, deftly tripping the uneven waves. Nearer, a yellow width unwinds; between, A point of emerald glows, and suddenly Shoots out and burns its way towards the west— A spark in tinder, then a stripe of fire, And last a sheet of phosphorescent green Fuming with white waves. Listen! at my feet The uplifted shuddering rollers headlong fall, And jangle on the beach as the surf breaks In silver chains and shekels; while the wind Out of the southwest sings across the deep. Straightway a new sky makes another sea. Occultly gifted, light upon the waves Juggles with hidden beams behind a cloud Bright but impenetrable. Near the shore A vein of saffron shines; beyond, a band Of olive hue blends with a sapphire zone; Further away, wine-coloured water heaves Against a high sea-wall of swarthy fog. Is it the sea that gleams in merging breadths Of colour dark and wet? Or do the powers, That decorate the quarters of the world, In some vast crucible dissolve and fuse Virginal mines of ruby, malachite, Jacinth and chrysoprase to pave the floor Of ocean rough with wrecks and skeletons? Nature is now about some mystery! But while I watch, ere I can mark the change, The passionate sun flames through the shrivelled cloud, And all the crisp and curling water wakes, Blue as the naked sky that bathes in it. Herbert How does it happen you are so beset? Ninian I shall attempt to tell you honestly. It was engraven deeply on my mind In daily lessons from my infancy Until I left my father's house, that not Ability and knowledge, beauty and strength, But goodness only can avail. I watched, And thought I understood that beauty, strength And knowledge ought to reign, they being indeed The trinity of goodness; but I claimed That this should be revealed to me, that I Should be directly warned by God Himself In the old fashion. Strange it seems; and yet It was not very strange. Each morn and eve, Year after year, I heard the prophets read, Heard strong believing prayer: the atmosphere Was not allied more nearly to my breath Than to my mind the thought of God—no dream Of deity; a living, active God. On hill-tops, by the sea, in storm, in calm I cried to Him to speak to me; with tears Solicited a sign. Sleepless and pale I wandered like a ghost, and day and night Waited upon a message from on high. Sunset and sunrise came; the seasons past; The years went slowly by; but still to me The universe was dumb. Books helped me not, Except for pleasure or to gain command Of words: I would have God's own voice or none At last I ceased to hope and found content In roaming through the land. The magic sun Drew pictures on my sight. Wondering I watched; Nor could the secular fairy ever change My wonder into curiosity. All my emotion and imagining Were of the finest tissue that is woven From sense and thought. No well-thumbed page appeared In the hard book of memory when I woke: Amazed I trembled newly into life: I seemed to be created every morn. A golden trumpet pealed along the sky: The sun arose; the whole earth rushed upon me. Sometimes the tree that stroked my window-pane Was more than I could grasp; sometimes my thought Absorbed the universe, which fell away And dwindled from my ken, as if my mind Had been the roomy continent of space.— My way of life led me to London town, And difficulties—which I overcame, Equipped with patience and necessity. Then suddenly before my thoughts might leap Resurgent from the living tomb of care And dip their wings in dawn, about me clung The slimy folds of sin: its nether coils Are hidden in the sepulchre of time, The glutted past; the pallid future strains In travail with its fiery eyes and fangs: I peer from out the slippery middle wreaths And see blurred visions of the world, or watch The flashing scenes that haunt my memory. When heedfully I viewed my latter days— Considering for the first time in my life The naked facts of my affairs and me— I found that underneath indifference To every aim saving a livelihood And leisure to enjoy nature and art, My source of strength, though never to myself Confessed before, had been the lurking thought That poison, or a bullet, or the waves Could stop the unendurable ecstasy Of pain or pleasure, at whichever pole Of passion I determined to forsake The orb of life, on my acceptance thrust In ignorance and disregard of me, My temperament and fitness for the gift; But now that refuge of despair is shut, For other lives have twined themselves with mine. And yet.... How shall I seize you with due dread Of the offensive tide that stifles me, The worm obscene in whose close coils I writhe? ... Now I conceive it clearly; you shall mark Fate's way with me! A tedious decade hence My son shall come and pitifully cry, ‘Father, why am I weak, outclassed, outcast? ‘I cannot do the things that others do; ‘I take no place in work or play; my brains ‘Are unelastic: something in my head ‘Snaps when I fain would study; visions rise ‘Unsummoned; phantom tongues mumble strange news; ‘And when I would contend in games, my bones ‘Grow pithless, and my sinews shrink; my heart!— ‘Who wore it out with sensual drudgery ‘Before it came to me? what warped its valves? ‘It has been used: my heart is secondhand! ‘Why had I not the force to be born great, ‘Fit for a splendid stage, a noble part, ‘A crisis in the world? Why must I think ‘Such things at seventeen? Why think at all ‘When love should lap me in a constant dream? ‘I have no faith instinctive in myself; ‘No reservoir profound of energy; ‘No fathomless resource; no central fire; ‘No passionate aroma in my blood ‘Filling the world with fragrance where I come; ‘No rapt imagination to transmute ‘All pallor into glory. Life you gave: ‘Where is my birthright, sir, beauty and strength?’ What can I say to him? Herbert Percy Sandy The truth! Ninian This then:— ‘My son, your ancestors supplanted you: ‘You are my child; hence are your teeth on edge. ‘Our blood is stale; the tree from which we spring ‘Fades at the top. Two of our family ‘Have died insane in my time: one I saw ‘Go mad. The sounds and sights that visit you ‘Attend me too, foretellers of our doom. ‘The ultimate iniquity is mine; ‘But from a root in distant ages sunk ‘The loathsome filaments entangle you. ‘And I impeach the smooth conniving world, ‘The bland accomplice that has made and makes ‘A merit of defect, a cult of woe, ‘Sowing exhausted land with seed that's foul, ‘To harvest tares of madness, impotence, ‘Uncomeliness in wasteful granaries— ‘I mean asylums, prisons, hospitals. ‘If only nineteen hundred years ago ‘A gospel of the pride of life had rung ‘Our doleful era in; if the device ‘In nature's choice of beauty and of strength ‘Had then been shown to man, how had the world ‘Approved the excellent expedient, ‘With voluntary euthanasia ‘Weeded humanity at once, and made ‘A race of heroes in a golden age! ... ‘This helps not. All the blame is mine, my son, ‘Who never should have been’ ... It palsies me; I cannot comfort him; he stands and stares Defeated ere he was begot.—Behold The ancient snake that pinions me! Like one Chained to a column in a turbid stream, About my ears a sluggish billow flaps, And chokes and daubs me with its ropy wash. Sandy Escape! I know the manner! Live at speed; And call your least caprice the law of God; Disdain the shows of things, and every love Whose stamen is not hate; self-centred stand; Accept no second thought; in every throb Your heart gives, every murmur of your mind, Listen devoutly to the trump of doom. You are your birthright; let it serve you well: Be your own star, for strength is from within, And one against the world will always win! Ninian I cannot act. The subtle coils grow tense, And crush my limbs, my heart, my throat, my head. I am the sufferer, the endurer, I. Yet God who gives no presage hitherto, Haply intends hereafter to be heard. I am not thinking solely of myself, But of the groaning cataract of life, The ruddy stream that leaps importunate Out of the night, and in a moment vaults The immediate treacherous precipice of time, Splashing the stars, downward into the night. Meanwhile for me no lulling opiate, No dream, no mystic solvent: I must watch Hopeless, unhelped, till I go mad or die. Herbert But you have hope and help. Ninian I? Show me them! Herbert You went forth seeking God and found the world The sounds and sights that haunt, and help and please. The canopy and state of day and night: The pageant of the year; the changing moods, The loyal constancy and testament Of Nature—her asides, her hints, and smiles, Her clear ideas of repose and toil, Her covenant and noble ministry Of light and darkness, and of life and death, Are the true salve for your distempered mind. Blame not yourself too much; admit no fear Of madness with the sunrise in your blood; And hold your own intelligence in awe As the most high: there is no other God— No God at all; yet God is in the womb— A living God, no mystic deity. With idols in its infancy the world Deceived itself as maidens do with dolls, And as it grew pretended and believed That what it should bring forth already reigned. Now is its hour come, but it only knows The sick dismay and anguish, ignorant Of birth-pangs and an offspring more divine Than man has yet imagined. I have woes, As you and all men have in their degree; So let us think we are the tortured nerves Of Being in travail with a higher type. I know that I shall crumble back to dust, And cease for evermore from sense and thought, But this contents me well in my distress:— I, being human, touch the highest reach Attained by matter, and within me feel The motion of a loftier than I: Out of the beast came man; from man comes God. Deepest delight is in the certainty That to the all pervading element Wherein the universe disports a while, Ethereal oblivion, my deeds And I eternally belong. Ninian Yes... See, They throng the room!—no spectres, but themselves: Sibilant depths of darkness; avenues Of latticed light; ambrosial, pine-strewn glades; Ravines and waterfalls; the grass-green turf, Where primroses by secret alchemy Distil from buried treasure golden leaves, And where forget-me-nots above the tombs Of snow-drops hang their candelabra, trimmed With azure light—turquoise by magic roots Drawn from the bowels of the earth and changed To living flame; roses, laburnum, lilac; Sunrise and sunset like a glowing vice Bloodstained that grips the world; the restless moon Swung low to light us; clouds; the limpid sky; The bourdon of the great ground-bee, athwart A lonely hill-side, vibrant on the air, And subtler than the scent of violets; Sonorous winds, storm, thunder, and the sea. MIDSUMMER DAY Basil Sandy Herbert Sandy I cannot write, I cannot think; 'Tis half delight and half distress: My memory stumbles on the brink Of some unfathomed happiness— Of some old happiness divine. What haunting scent, what haunting note, What word, or what melodious line, Sends my heart throbbing to my throat? Basil What? thrilled with happiness to-day, The longest day in all the year, Which we must spend in making hay By thrashing straw in Fleet Street here! What scent? what sound? The odour stale Of watered streets; the bruit loud Of hoof and wheel on road and rail, The rush and trample of the crowd! Herbert Humming the song of many a lark, Out of the sea, across the shires, The west wind blows about the park, And faintly stirs the Fleet Street wires. Perhaps it sows the happy seed That blossoms in your memory; Certain of many a western mead, And hill and stream it speaks to me. With rosy showers of apple-bloom The orchard sward is mantled deep; Shaded in some sequestered coombe The red deer in the Quantocks sleep. Basil Go on: of rustic visions tell Till I forget the wilderness Of sooty brick, the dusty smell, The jangle of the printing-press. Herbert I hear the woodman's measured stroke; I see the amber streamlet glide— Above, the green gold of the oak Fledges the gorge on either side. A thatched roof shines athwart the gloom Of the high moorland's darksome ground; Far off the surging rollers boom, And fill the shadowy wood with sound Basil You have pronounced the magic sign! The city with its thousand years, Like some embodied mood of mine Uncouth, prodigious, disappears. I stand upon a lowly bridge, Moss-grown beside the old Essex home; Over the distant purple ridge The clouds arise in sultry foam; In many a cluster, wreath and chain A silvery vapour hangs on high, And snowy scarfs of silken grain Bedeck the blue slopes of the sky; The wandering water sighs and calls, And breaks into a chant that rings Beneath the vaulted bridge, then falls And under heaven softly sings; A light wind lingers here and there, And whispers in an unknown tongue The passionate secrets of the air, That never may by men be sung: Low, low, it whispers; stays, and goes; It comes again; again takes flight; And like a subtle presence grows And almost gathers into sight. Sandy The wind that stirs the Fleet Street wires, And roams and quests about the Park, That wanders all across the shires, Humming the song of many a lark— The wind—it is the wind, whose breath, Perfumed with roses, wakes in me From shrouded slumbers deep as death A yet unfaded memory. Basil About Midsummer, every hour Ten thousand rosebuds opening blush, The land is all one rosy bower, And rosy odours haunt and flush The winds of heaven up and down: On the top-gallant of the air The lark, the pressman in the town Breathe only rosy incense rare. Sandy And I, enchanted by the rose, Remember when I first began To know what in its bosom glows Exhaling scent ambrosian. A child, at home in streets and quays, The city tumult in my brain, I only knew of tarnished trees, And skies corroding vapours stain. One summer—Time upon my head Had showered the curls of years eleven— Me, for a month, good fortune led Where trees are green and hills kiss heaven. By glen and mountain, moor and lawn, Burn-side and sheep-path, day and night, I wandered, a belated faun, All sense, all wonder, all delight. And once at eve I climbed a hill, Burning to see the sun appear, And watched the jewelled darkness fill With lamps and clustered tapers clear. At last the strongest stars were spent; A glimmering shadow overcame The swarthy-purple firmament, And throbbed and kindled into flame; The pallid day, the trembling day Put on her saffron wedding-dress, And watched her bridegroom far away Soar through the starry wilderness. I clasped my hands and closed my eyes, And tears relieved my ecstasy: I dared not watch the sun arise; Nor knew what magic daunted me: And yet the roses seemed to tell More than the morn, had I but known The meaning of the fragrant smell That bound me with a subtle zone. But in the gloaming when we played At hide-and-seek, and I with her Behind a rose-bush hid, afraid To meet her gaze, to breathe, or stir, The dungeon of my sense was riven, The beauty of the world laid bare, A great wind caught me up to heaven Upon a cloud of golden hair; And mouth touched mouth; and love was born; And when our wondering vision blent, We found the meaning of the morn, The meaning of the rose's scent. Ah me! ah me! since then! since then! Herbert Nay, nay; let self-reproaches be! Now that this thought is throned again, Be zealous for its sovereignty. Basil And brave, great Nature must be thanked; And we must worship on our knees, And hold for ever sacro-sanct Such dewy memories as these. MAYDAY Brian Menzies Brian Late—you are late. And where have you been? Menzies I have been in the woods and the lanes. Brian And what have you heard, and what have you seen, And what in your fancy reigns? Menzies I have heard the ring-dove coo, And the cuckoo toll his bell; I have seen the shrieking jay flash blue Athwart a wooded dell. I have heard the chattering streamlet run In haste to reach the sea; I have watched the golden bee, Cupid and Hymen in one, Morn, noon, and afternoon, Fulfil the tingling hours With the murmuring sound of his bridal tune As he married the waiting flowers. The long, long hedgerows white with May Bordered the rustling lanes; And a fragrant wind blew all the day. Brian But what in your fancy reigns? Menzies There reigned, and is regnant still, A memory, long forgot, Of a lowland town, a lowland hill, And a lowland woman's lot. She shed her tears, and dreamed her dreams, And wore her sad wan smiles, Where a wide water winds and gleams Among its links and isles. Rock-perched a royal borough towers High over the highest trees, With crumbling walls and faded bowers And mouldering palaces. Near by a hill its dark crest lifts Sheer from the river bank, And cloudy shadow broods and shifts About its russet flank. The land is stained with purple dyes Of high-romantic scenes; The air still quivers with the sighs Of tragic kings and queens; The very ploughman holds his plough As proudly as a lance; The milkmaid bears a dreamy brow, Inheriting romance. Even in my father's time a crew Of lads and lasses gay Would dip their faces in the dew Upon the first of May. This joyful mood might not withstand The age's growing care, When railways hacked and scored the land, And wires engraved the air. One woman only, all forlorn, While twenty summers flew, Still climbed the hill each May-day morn Her beauty to renew! What love, what loss, what hope was hers No man or maid could tell, But all the loyal lowlanders Esteemed her custom well. Dressed in a hat with broken plume, A cape, and worn black frock, Before the dawn she left her room, And climbed by scar and rock. And so to-day by lane and burn, By scented hedge and shaw, At many a pause and sudden turn Her wistful face I saw. And once as in a waking dream The whole fair lowland shone— The palaced rock, the hill, the stream, The softly coming dawn: And she with sobs and murmured cries To earth's green bosom laid Her withered cheek, while from her eyes Hot dew on cold dew strayed. Brian What was her end?MenziesOh, exquisite! Winter and Spring she lay Bedridden in a palsy fit; But on the first of May, When the lark waked the sun, she too Arose, and in a trance Went forth to bathe her face in dew, The martyr of romance. They found her on the green hill-side At home, and sleeping fast Her endless sleep, Death's pallid bride, Most beautiful at last. (Singing within.) ‘Remember us poor Mayers all, ‘And thus we do begin ‘To lead our lives in righteousness, ‘Or else we die in sin. ‘I have been rambling all this night, ‘And almost all this day, ‘And now returned back again ‘I bring you a branch of May.’ Brian An antique minstrel! Hark! Menzies It is Basil: I know his note. (Enter Basil, carrying a branch of hawthorn blossom.) Menzies Have you been where the night-jar haunts the dark In outland ways remote? Basil I have been with the nightingale: I have learned his song so sweet: I sang it aloud by wood and dale, And under my breath in the street. If the words would only flow— Menzies Oh, sing it now! Basil No, no! But it went like this, I think:— ‘Where the purple hyacinths grew, ‘And the campions white and pink, ‘The jewelled butterflies flew ‘From jewelled cups to drink; ‘And some were violet-eyed, ‘Some blue, some rosy-red, ‘Gold-plumed, or damask-dyed, ‘Earth-born and heaven-bred; ‘And every chalice drooped and sighed ‘When the splendid revellers fled; ‘But never a flower its cup denied ‘Though the wine of life was shed. ‘The lark from the top of heaven raved ‘Of the sunshine sweet and old; ‘And the whispering branches dipped and laved ‘In the light; and waste and wold ‘Took heart and shone; and the buttercups paved ‘The emerald meads with gold. ‘Now in the forest is night; ‘The flowers have gone to sleep; ‘But the stars have opened their eyes of light ‘Under the brows of heaven deep; ‘And gentle shadows cross my sight, ‘And murmurs rustle and creep; ‘And the very darkness is fresh and bright ‘With the tears the sweet dews weep. ‘The wind steals down the lawns ‘With a whisper of ecstasy, ‘Of moonlit nights and rosy dawns, ‘And a nest in a hawthorn tree, ‘Of the little mate for whom I wait, ‘Flying across the sea, ‘Through storm and night as sure as fate, ‘Swift-winged with love for me.’ Menzies And so you brought home the May With the nightingale's song in your ears. Basil And sad eyes flashed for a moment gay, Or welled with happy tears, When they saw my branch and remembered the day, And forgot the tedious years. And I thought as I tuned my rhyme, And waved the branch in my hand, Of the famous olden time When a Maypole stood in the Strand. Brian Let the Golden Days return! Menzies And let the May-Queen reign! Basil When smokeless fires burn, And London is born again! ST GEORGE'S DAY Basil Menzies Percy Brian Herbert Sandy Herbert I hear the lark and linnet sing; I hear the whitethroat's alto ring. Menzies I hear the idle workman sigh; I hear his hungry children cry. Sandy Still sad and brooding over ill: Why listen to discordant tones? Herbert We dream, we sing, we drive the quill To keep the flesh upon our bones. Therefore what trade have we with wrongs, With ways and woes that spoil our songs? Menzies None, none! Alas, there lies the sting! We see, we feel, but cannot aid; We hide our foolish heads and sing: We live, we die; and all is said. Herbert To wonder-worlds of old romance Our aching thoughts for solace run. Brian And some have stolen fire from France. Sandy And some adore the Midnight sun. Menzies I, too, for light the world explore, And trembling, tread where angels trod; Devout at every shrine adore, And follow after each new god. But by the altar everywhere I find the money-changer's stall; And littering every temple-stair The sick and sore like maggots crawl. Basil Your talk is vain; your voice is hoarse. Menzies I would they were as hoarse and vain As their wide-weltering spring and source Of helpless woe, of wrath insane. Herbert Why will you hug the coast of Hell? Brian Why antedate the Judgment Day? Menzies Nay, flout me not; you know me well. Basil Right, comrade! Give your fancy way. Menzies I cannot see the stars and flowers, Nor hear the lark's soprano ring, Because a ruddy darkness lowers For ever, and the tempests sing. I see the strong coerce the weak, And labour overwrought rebel; I hear the useless treadmill creak, The prisoner, cursing in his cell; I see the loafer-burnished wall; I hear the rotting match-girl whine; I see the unslept switchman fall; I hear the explosion in the mine; I see along the heedless street The sandwichmen trudge through the mire; I hear the tired quick tripping feet Of sad, gay girls who ply for hire. Basil To brood on feeble woe at length Must drive the sanest thinker mad; Consider rather weal and strength. Menzies On what foundations do they stand? I mark the sable ironclad In every sea; in every land, An army, idling on the chain Of rusty peace that chafes and frets Its seven-leagued limbs, and bristled mane Of glittering bayonets; The glowing blast, the fire-shot smoke Where guns are forged and armour-plate; The mammoth hammer's pounding stroke; The din of our dread iron date. And always divers undertones Within the roaring tempest throb— The chink of gold, the labourer's groans, The infant's wail, the woman's sob. Hoarsely they beg of Fate to give A little lightening of their woe, A little time to love, to live, A little time to think and know. I see where from the slums may rise Some unexpected dreadful dawn— The gleam of steeled and scowling eyes, A flash of women's faces wan! Basil This is St George's Day. Menzies St George? A wretched thief I vow. Herbert Nay, Menzies, you should rather say, St George for Merry England, now! Sandy That surely is a phantom cry, Hollow and vain for many years. Menzies I hear the idle workmen sigh; I hear the drip of women's tears. Herbert I hear the lofty lark, The lowly nightingale Basil The Present is a dungeon dark Of social problems. Break the gaol! Get out into the splendid Past Or bid the splendid Future hail. Menzies Nor then, nor now, nor first, nor last, I know. The slave of ruthless Law, To me Time seems a dungeon vast Where Life lies rotting in the straw. Basil I care not for your images Of Life and Law. I want to sing Of England and of Englishmen Who made our country what it is. Herbert And I to praise the English Spring. Percy St George for Merry England, then! Menzies There is no England now, I fear. Basil No England, say you, and since when? Menzies Cockney and Celt and Scot are here, And Democrats and ‘ans’ and ‘ists’ In clubs and cliques and divers lists; But now we have no Englishmen. Basil You utter what you never felt, I know. By bog and mount and fen, No Saxon, Norman, Scot, or Celt I find, but only Englishmen. Herbert In all our hedges roses bud. Basil And thought and speech are more than blood. Herbert Away with spleen, and let us sing The praises of the English Spring! Basil In weeds of gold and purple hues Glad April bursts with piping news Of swifts and swallows come again, And of the tender pensive strain The bulfinch sings from bush to bush. Percy And oh! the blackbird and the thrush Interpret as no master may The meaning of the night and day. Sandy They catch the whispers of the breeze And weave them into melodies. Brian They utter for the hours that pass The purpose of their moments bright. Basil They speak the passion of the grass, That grows so stoutly day and night. Herbert St George for merry England then! For we are all good Englishmen! Percy We stand as our forefathers stood For Liberty's and Conscience' sake. Herbert We are the sons of Robin Hood, The sons of Hereward the Wake. Percy The sons of yeomen, English-fed, Ready to feast or drink or fight. Herbert The sons of kings—of Hal and Ned, Who kept their island right and tight. Percy The sons of Cromwell's Ironsides, Who knew no king but God above. Basil We are the sons of English brides, Who married Englishmen for love. Sandy Oh, now I see Fate's means and ends! The Bruce and Wallace wight I ken, Who saved old Scotland from its friends, Were mighty northern Englishmen. Brian And Parnell, who so greatly fought Against a wanton useless yoke, With Fate inevitably wrought That Irish should be English folk. Basil By bogland, highland, down, and fen, All Englishmen, all Englishmen! Menzies There is no England now, I say— Brian No England now! My grief, my grief! Menzies We lie widespread, the dragon-prey Of any Cappadocian thief. In Arctic and Pacific seas We lounge and loaf: and either pole We reach with sprawling colonies— Unwieldy limbs that lack a soul. Basil St George for Greater England, then! The Boreal and the Austral men! They reverence the heroic roll Of Englishmen who sang and fought: They have a soul, a mighty soul, The soul of English speech and thought. Sandy And when the soul of England slept— Basil St George for foolish England, then!— Sandy Lo! Washington and Lincoln kept America for Englishmen! Basil Hurrah! The English people reigns Across the wide Atlantic flood! It could not bind itself in chains! For Yankee blood is English blood. Herbert And here the spring is queen In robes of white and green. Percy In chestnut sconces opening wide Tapers shall burn some fresh May morn. Brian And the elder brightens the highway side, And the briony binds the thorn. Sandy White is the snow of the leafless sloe The saxifrage by the sedge, And white the lady-smocks a-row And sauce-alone in the hedge. Basil England is in her Spring; She only begins to be. Oh! for an organ voice to sing The summer I can see! But the Past is there; and a mole may know, And a bat may understand, That we are the people wherever we go— Kings by sea and land! Herbert And the spring is crowned and stoled In purple and in gold. Percy Wherever light, wherever shade is, Gold and purple may be seen. Brian Gold and purple lords-and-ladies Tread a measure on the green. Herbert In deserts where the wild wind blows Blossoms the magic hæmony. Percy Deep in the Chiltern woodland glows The purple pasque anemone. Basil And England still grows great And never shall grow old; Within our hands we hold The world's fate. Menzies We hold the world's fate? The cry seems out of date. Basil Not while a single Englishman Can work with English brains and bones! Awaiting us since time began, The swamps of ice, the wastes of flame! In Boreal and Austral zones Took life and meaning when we came. The Sphinx that watches by the Nile Has seen great empires pass away: The mightiest lasted but a while; Yet ours shall not decay. Because, although red blood may flow, And ocean shake with shot, Not England's sword but England's Word Undoes the Gordian Knot. Bold tongue, stout heart, strong hand, brave brow The world's four quarters win; And patiently with axe and plough We bring the deserts in. Menzies Whence comes this patriotic craze? Spare us at least the hackneyed brag About the famous English flag. Basil I'll spare no flourish of its praise. Where'er our flag floats in the wind Order and justice dawn and shine. The dusky myriads of Ind, The swarthy tribes far south the line, And all who fight with lawless law, And all with lawless men who cope Look hitherward across the brine, For we are the world's forlorn hope. Menzies That makes my heart leap up! Hurrah! We are the world's forlorn hope! Herbert And with the merry birds we sing The praises of the English Spring. Percy Iris and orchis now unfold. Brian The drooping-leaved laburnums ope In thunder-showers of greenish gold. Menzies And we are the world's forlorn hope! Sandy The lilacs shake their dancing plumes Of lavender, mauve, and heliotrope. Herbert The speedwell on the highway blooms. Menzies And we are the world's forlorn hope! Sandy Skeletons lurk in every street. Herbert We push and strike for air and scope. Brian The pulses of rebellion beat Where want and hunger sulk and mope. Menzies But though we wander far astray, And oft in gloomy darkness grope, Fearless we face the blackest day, For we are the world's forlorn hope. Sandy St George for Merry England then! For we are all good Englishmen! Basil St George for Greater England then! The Boreal and the Austral men! All By bogland, highland, down, and fen, All Englishmen, all Englishmen! Who with their latest breath shall sing Of England and the English Spring! THE END</field>
