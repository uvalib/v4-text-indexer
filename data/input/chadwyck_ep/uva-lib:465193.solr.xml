      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. DEDICATION. TO THE EARL OF RADNOR. TO THE REV. MR. J. LANGHORNE, ON READING HIS VISIONS OF FANCY, &amp;c. BY MISS WHATELEY. Fraught with each wish the friendly breast can form, A simple muse, O! Langhorne, would intrude; Her lays are languid, but her heart is warm, Tho' not with Fancy's potent powers endu'd. Fancy, tho' erst she shed a glimmering ray, And op'd to fairy scenes my infant eye, From Pain, and Care, has wing'd her chearful way, And with Hygeia sought a milder sky. No more my trembling hand attempts the lyre, Which Shenstone oft (sweet bard) has deign'd to praise; Even tuneful Langhorne's friendship fails t' inspire The glow that warm'd my breast in happier days. Yet not this cold heart can remain unmov'd, When thy sweet numbers strike my raptur'd ear; The silver sounds, by ev'ry muse approv'd, Suspend a while the melancholy tear. What time, on Arrowe's osier'd banks reclin'd, I to the pale moon pour'd thy plaintive lay; Smooth roll'd the waves, more gently sigh'd the wind, And Echo stole the tender notes away. Sweet Elves and Fays, that o'er the shadowy plains Their mystic rites, and mazy dance pursue, Tun'd their light minstrelsy to softer strains, And from thy lays their melting music drew. Sweet son of Fancy! may the white-rob'd Hours Shed their kind influence on thy gentle breast; May Hebe strew thy vernal path with flow'rs, Blest in thy love, and in thy friendship blest. Smooth as thy numbers may thy years advance, Pale Care and Pain their speeding darts suspend; May Health, and Fancy, lead the chearful dance, And Hope for ever her fair torch extend. For thee may Fame her fairest chaplets twine; Each fragrant bloom, that paints Aonia's brow, Each flow'r, that blows by Alcidale, be thine; With the chaste laurel's never-fading bough: On thee may faithful friendship's cordial smile Attendant wait to sooth each rising care; The nymph thou lov'st be thine, devoid of guile, Mild, virtuous, kind, compassionate, and fair. May thy sweet lyre still charm the generous mind, Thy liberal muse the patriot spirit raise; While, in thy page to latest time consign'd, Virtue receives the meed of polish'd praise. SONNET TO MR. LANGHORNE. BY JOHN SCOTT, ESQ. Langhorne, unknown to me (sequester'd swain!) Save by the Muse's soul-enchanting lay, To kindred spirits never sung in vain, Accept the tribute of this light essay; Due for thy sweet songs that amus'd my day! Where Fancy held her visionary reign, Or Scotland's honours claim'd the pastoral strain. Or Music came o'er Handel tears to pay: For all thy Irwan's flow'ry banks display, Thy Persian lover and his Indian fair; All Theodosius' mournful lines convey, Where Pride and Av'rice part a matchless pair; Receive just praise and wreaths that ne'er decay, By Fame and Virtue twin'd for thee to wear. Amwell, near Ware, 16 March, 1766. TO THE HONOURABLE CHARLES YORKE. A Muse that lov'd in Nature's walks to stray, And gather'd many a wild flower in her way, To Nature's friend her genuine gifts would bring, The light amusements of Life's vacant spring; Nor shalt thou, Yorke, her humble offering blame, If pure her incense, and unmixt her flame. She pours no flattery into Folly's ear, No shameless hireling of a shameless Peer, The friends of Pope indulge her native lays, And Gloucester joins with Lyttelton to praise. Each judge of art her strain, tho' artless, loves; And Shenstone smil'd, and polish'd Hurd approves. O may such spirits long protect my page, Surviving lights of Wit's departed age! Long may I in their kind opinion live! All meaner praise, all envy I forgive.— Yet fairly be my future laurels won! Nor let me bear a bride to Hardwicke's son! Should his free suffrage own the favour'd strain, Tho' vain the toil, the glory were not vain. PROEMIUM. WRITTEN IN 1766. In Eden's The River Eden, in Westmorland. vale, where early fancy wrought Her wild embroidery on the ground of thought, Where Pembroke's The Countess of Pembroke, to whom Sir Philip Sidney dedicated his Arcadia, resided at Appleby, a small but beautiful town in Westmorland, situated upon the Eden. grottos, strew'd with Sidney's bays, Recall'd the dreams of visionary days, Thus the fond Muse, that sooth'd my vacant youth, Prophetic sung, and what she sung was truth. “Boy, break thy lyre, and cast thy reed away; Vain are the honours of the fruitless bay. Tho' with each charm thy polish'd lay should please, Glow into strength, yet soften into ease; Should Attic fancy brighten every line, And all Aonia's harmony be thine; Say would thy cares a grateful age repay? Fame wreathe thy brows, or Fortune gild thy way? Ev'n her own fools, if Fortune smile, shall blame; And Envy lurks beneath the flowers of Fame. Yet, if resolv'd, secure of future praise, To tune sweet songs, and live melodious days, Let not the hand, that decks my holy shrine, Round Folly's head the blasted laurel twine. Just to thyself, dishonest grandeur scorn; Nor gild the bust of meanness nobly born. Let truth, let freedom still thy lays approve! Respect my precepts, and retain my love! STUDLEY PARK. TO THE REV. MR. FARRER. Farrer! to thee these early lays I owe: Thy friendship warms the heart from whence they flow. Thee, thee I find, in all I find to please; In this thy elegance, in that thy ease. Come then with Fancy to thy fav'rite scene, Where Studley triumphs in her wreaths of green, And, pleas'd for once, while Eden smiles again, Forget that Life's inheritance is pain. Say, shall we muse along yon arching shades, Whose aweful gloom no brightning ray pervades; Or down these vales where vernal flowers display Their golden bosoms to the smiles of day, Where the fond eye in sweet distraction strays, Most pleas'd, when most it knows not where to gaze? Here groves arrang'd in various order rise, And bend their quiv'ring summits in the skies. The regal Oak high o'er the circling shade. Exalts the hoary honours of his head. The spreading Ash a diff'ring green displays, And the smooth Asp in soothing whispers plays. The Fir that blooms in Spring's eternal prime, The spiry Poplar, and the stately Lime. Here moss-clad walks, there lawns of lively green, United, form one nicely-varying scene: The varying scene still charms th' attentive sight, Or brown with shades, or op'ning into light. Here the gay tenants of the tuneful grove, Harmonious breathe the raptures of their love: Each warbler sweet that hails the genial Spring, Tunes the glad song, and plies th' expanded wing: The love-suggested notes, in varied strains, Fly round the vocal hills and list'ning plains: The vocal hills and list'ning plains prolong, In varied strains, the love-suggested song. To thee, all-bounteous Nature! thee they pay The welcon e tribute of their grateful lay! To thee, whose kindly-studious hand prepares The fresh'ning fields and softly-breathing airs; Whose parent-bounty annual still provides Of foodful insects such unbounded tides. Beneath some friendly leaf supremely blest, Each pours at large the raptures of his breast; Nor changeful seasons mourns, nor storms unkind, With those contented, and to these resign'd. Here sprightly range the grove, or skim the plain, The sportive deer, a nicely-checker'd train. Oft near their haunt, on him who curious strays, All throng'd abreast in fix'd attention gaze; Th' intruding spy suspiciously survey, Then butting limp along, and lightly frisk away. Not so, when raves the pack's approaching roar, Then Loves endear, then Nature smiles no more: In wild amaze, all tremblingly-dismay'd, Burst thro' the groves, and bound along the glade. 'Till now some destin'd stag, prepar'd to fly, Fires all the malice of the murd'ring cry: Forc'd from his helpless mates the fated prey Bears on the wings of quiv'ring Fear away: In flight (ah! could his matchless flight avail!) Scorns the fierce steed, and leaves the flying gale. Now trembling stops—and listens from afar In long, long deep'ning howls, the madd'ning war; While loud-exulting triumphs thunder round, Tremble the mountains, and the rocks rebound. In vain, yet vig'rous, he renews his race, In vain dark mazes oft perplex the chace: With speed, inspir'd by grief, he springs again Thro' vaulted woods, and devious wilds in vain. Th' unrav'lling pack still, onward-pouring, trace The various mazes of his circling race. Breathless at last with long-repeated toil, Sick'ning he stands—he yields—he falls the spoil. From all the various blooms of painted bow'rs, Fair, banky wilds, and vallies fring'd with flow'rs, Where Nature in profusion smiles delight, With pleasure-sated turns the roving sight. Come then, bright vision! child of heav'nly day! From this fair summit ampler scenes survey; One spacious field in circling order eye, And active round the far horizon fly; Where dales descend, or ridgy mountains rise, And lose their aspect in the falling skies. What pleasing scenes the landskip wide displays! Th' inchanting prospect bids for ever gaze. Hail charming fields, of happy swains the care! Hail happy swains possest of fields so fair! In peace your plenteous labours long enjoy; No murd'ring wars shall waste, nor foes destroy; While western gales Earth's teeming womb unbind, The seasons change, and bounteous suns are kind. To social towns, see! wealthy Commerce brings Rejoicing Affluence on his silver wings. On verdant hills, see! flocks innum'rous feed, Or thoughtful listen to the lively reed. See! golden harvests sweep the bending plains; “And Peace and Plenty own a Brunswick reigns.” The wand'ring eye from Nature's wild domain Attracted, turns to fairer scenes again. Scenes, which to thee, refining Art! belong, Invite the poet, and inspire the song. Sweet, philosophic muse! that lov'st to stray In woody-curtain'd walks and dim-seen day, Lead me, where lonely Contemplation roves, Thro' silent shades and solitary groves. Stop, daring foot! the sacred maid is here! These awful glooms confess the goddess near. Low in these woods her fav'rite scene is laid, The fence umbrageous, and the dark'ning shade, Whose bow'ry branches bar the vagrant eye, Assailing storms and parching suns defy. A gentle current calmly steals serene, In silv'ry mazes, o'er the weeping green, 'Till op'ning bright, its bursting waters spread, And fall fast-flashing down a wide cascade. A spacious lake below expanded lies, And lends a mirror to the quiv'ring skies. Here pendent domes, there dancing forests seem To float and tremble in the waving gleam. While gaily-musing o'er it's verdant side, Pleas'd I behold the glassy riv'let glide; Bright in the verdure of the blooming year, Where circling groves their full-blown honours wear; Ambrosial daughter of the spicy spring, While fragrant woodbine scents each zephyr's wing; While nectar-footed Morn, approaching, dyes, In radiant blush, the rosy-checker'd skies; The first fair Eden, o'er th' inchanted plain Reviving, smiles, or seems to smile again. Hail, blissful scene! divine Elysium hail! Ye flow'ry blooms eternal sweets exhale: The blest asylum's here, the sacred shore, Where toils tumultuous tear the breast no more. From wild Ambition free, from dire Despair, Appalling Terror, and perplexing Care, Happy the Man who in these shades can find That angel-bliss, Serenity of Mind; Walk the fair green, or in the grotto lie, With hope-strung breast, and heav'n-erected eye! While cheated worlds, by Pleasure's lure betray'd, Thro' rocks and sands pursue the syren-maid; And, long-bewilder'd, urge the weary chace, Tho' still the phantom slips their vain embrace: 'Tis his with pitying eye to see—to know Whence purest Joy's perennial fountains flow. With this exalting charm divinely blest, The dear reflection of a blameless breast: Where sweet-ey'd Love still smiles serenely gay, And heav'nly Virtue beams a brighter ray. Soft, smoothly-pacing slide his peaceful days, His own his censure, and his own his praise: Alike to him, both subjects of the grave, The seepter'd monarch, and the menial slave. Thrice happy he who Life's poor pains has laid In the lone tomb of some sequester'd shade! More amply blest, if gloriously retir'd, With Learning charm'd, and with the Muses fir'd; Who nobly dares with philosophic eye, Thro' full Creation's bounded orbs to fly; Pleas'd, in their well-form'd systems, still to find The matchless wisdom of th' immortal mind. Still charm'd, in Nature's various plan, to trace His boundless love and all-supporting grace. Ye pompous great! whose dream of glory springs From sounding titles, or the smiles of kings: Ye, laurell'd in the bleeding wreathes of war! And ye, whose hearts are center'd in a star! Say, all ye sons of power and splendor, say, E'er could ye boast one unimbitter'd day? Cease the vain hope in dazzling pomp to find Divine Content, to humbler lots assign'd; The modest fair frequents the lowly cell, Where smiling Peace and conscious Virtue dwell. While thro' the maze of winding bow'rs I stray, The shade's dim gloom, or vista's op'ning day; Soft-sighing groves, where silky breezes fill, Kiss the smooth plain, and glassy-dimpling rill; In silent vales, by sadly-mourning streams, Where swift-ey'd Fancy wings her waving dreams; What sacred awe the lonely scenes inspire! What joys transport me, and what raptures fire! Visions divine, inchanted I behold, And all the Muses all their charms unfold. Ye, woods of Pindus, and Ætolian plains, No more shall listen to immortal strains: Flow unconcern'd, no Muse celestial sings, Ye Thracian fountains, and Aonian springs! No more your shades shall leave their native shore, Nor songs arrest your raptur'd currents more. And thou, Parnassus, wrapt in deep alcoves, Mourn, in sad silence, thy forasken groves: No more thy warblers rival notes admire, Nor choral zephyrs fill the breathing lyre. Each drooping laurel bends its languid head; The strains are vanish'd, and the Muses fled. To nobler hills, where fairer forests grow, To vales, where streams in sweeter accents flow; To blooming Studley's more delightful shades Welcome, ye sacred, ye celestial maids! Wake the soft lute, here strike the sounding string, Make the groves echo, and the vallies ring; Harmonious lead, thro' rosy-smiling bow'rs, The soft-ey'd Graces and the dancing hours. In awsul scenes retir'd where gloomy night. Still broods, unbanish'd by returning light; Where Silence, fix'd in Meditation deep, Folds in her arms her fav'rite offspring Sleep; Musing along the lonely shades I roam 'Till beauteous rises a devoted dome; Thy fane, seraphic Piety! low plac'd In sable glooms, by deep'ning woods embrac'd. Nor radiant here the Prince of Day displays His morning blushes, nor meridian blaze: Rolls o'er the world the splendid orb unseen, 'Till his last glories gild the streaming green; Then sportive gleams thro' parting columns play, Here waves a shadow, and there smiles a ray. Just emblem of the man who, free from strife, Th' uneasy pains that vex the noon of life; Not dazzled with the diamond-beaming zone, Flash of a lace, or brilliance of a stone, Courts the last smiles of Life's declining ray, Where Hope exulting reaps eternal day. The sacred solitude, the lone recess, An awful pleasure on my soul impress. Raptures divine thro' all my bosom glow, The bliss alone immortal beings know. Ah, knew that sovereign bliss no base alloy, Wer't thou, my Farrer! witness to my joy; What nobler pleasure couid we boast below! What joy sublimer Heav'n itself bestow! Haste, my gay friend! my dear associate, haste! Life of my soul, and partner of my breast! Quick to these shades, these magic shades retire: Here light thy Graces, and thy virtue fire: Here sheds sweet Piety her beams divine, And all the Goddess fills her heav'nly shrine. Celestial maids before her altar move: White-handed Innocence, and weeping Love. Her tow'ring domes let Richmond boast alone; The sculptur'd statue and the breathing stone: Alone distinguish'd on the plains of Stowe, From Jones's hand the featur'd marble glow: Tho' there unnumber'd columns front the skies, To fancied Gods forbidden temples rise; Unenvied, Studley, be this pomp of art, 'Tis thine the pow'r to please a virtuous heart. From this lov'd scene with anxious steps I trace Each devious winding of the banky maze; To the tall summit of the steep repair, And view the gay surrounding prospect there. What joys expand my breast! what rapture warms! While all the landskip opens all its charms: While pleas'd I see, the parting shades between, The lake fair-gleaming and the smoother green; Thro' lowly grots where wand'ring shadows stray, Groves gently wave, and glist'ning waters play. On thee, fair Hackfall! Fancy bends her eye, Longs o'er the cliffs and deep'ning lawns to fly. Inchanted sees each silv'ry-floating wave Beat thy green banks, thy lonely vallies lave: And now delighted, now she joys to hear Thy deep, slow falls, long-lab'ring thro' her ear. All-beauteous Nature! object of my song, To thee my first, my latest strains belong: To thee my lays I tune, while envious art In rival charms here courts the raptur'd heart. Like thee to please, she decks the painted bow'r, Spreads the smooth lawn, and rears the velvet flow'r: With winding arbours crowns the sylvan dale, And bends the forest o'er the lowly vale: Bids the loud cataract deep-thund'ring roar, Or winds the riv'let round a mazy shore. Ambitious still, like thee, when she beguiles, Wins with thy grace, and in thy beauty smiles. In this gay Upon an eminence, east of the gardens, stands a house of Chinese structure. Dome where sportive Fancy plays, And imag'd life the pictur'd roof arrays; Proud in thy charms the mimic shines confest, Beams the soft eye, and heaves the panting breast. From thee, prime source! kind-handed Goddess! flow The purest blessings that we boast below: To thee its beauty owes this charming scene, These groves their fragrance, and those plains their green: For thee the Muses wreaths eternal twine, Immortal Maid! for every Muse is thine. Oh, wou'd'st thou lead me thro' the boundless sky! Regions untravell'd by a mortal eye; Or kindly aid, while studious I explore Those arduous paths thy Newton trod before! There wond'ring shou'd my ravish't eye survey New worlds of being, and new scenes of day. But if for my weak wing and trembling sight, Too vast the journey, and too full the light; Inglorious here I'll tune the lowly reed, How rolls the fountain, and how springs the mead. Or, bear me to the banks, ye sacred Nine! Of beauteous Isis, or the silver Tine. To Tine's delightful banks, where, ever gay, The generous F?lives the peaceful day: F?still free from passion's fretful train, Ne'er felt the thorn of anguish nor of pain: His heart-felt joys still Nature's charms improve, Her voice is music, and her visage love: Pleas'd with the change each various season brings, Imbrowning autumns, and impurpled springs: For him kind Nature all her treasures yields, She decks the forest, and she paints the fields. O say! where bloom those :ime-surviving groves, Where ancient bards first sung their sacred loves: Those sadly-solemn bow'rs, ye Muses! say, Where once the melancholy Cowley lay? When long perplext with Life's deluding snares, Her flatt'ring pleasures, and her fruitless cares; Obscure he fled to sylvan shades alone, And left mankind, to be for ever known. Such were the scenes where Spenser once retir'd, When great Eliza's fame the Muse inspir'd; When Gloriana led her poet's dreams, O'er flow'ry meadows, and by murm'ring streams. Immortal bards! whose death-contemning lays Shall shine, distinguish'd with eternal praise. Knew my poor Muse, like these to soar sublime, And spurn the ruins of insulting Time; Where'er I stray: where blooming Flora leads, O'er sunny mountains, and thro' purple meads; Or careless in the sylvan covert laid, Where falling rills amuse the mournful shade, Ye, rural fields, should still resound my lay, And thou, fair Studley! smile for ever gay. GENIUS AND VALOUR: A PASTORAL POEM. WRITTEN IN HONOUR OF A SISTER KINGDOM. MDCCLXIII. Amyntor, Chorus of shepherds. Where Tweed's fair plains in liberal beauty lie, And Flora laughs beneath a lucid sky; Long winding vales where crystal waters lave, Where blythe birds warble, and where green woods wave, A bright-hair'd Shepherd, in young beauty's bloom, Tun'd his sweet pipe behind the yellow broom. Free to the gale his waving ringlets lay, And his blue eyes diffus'd an azure day. Light o'er his limbs a careless robe he flung; Health rais'd his heart, and strength his firm nerves strung. His native plains poetic charms inspir'd, Wild scenes, where ancient Fancy oft retir'd! Oft led her faeries to the Shepherd's lay, By Yarrow's banks, or groves of Endermay. Nor only his those images that rise Fair to the glance of Fancy's plastic eyes; His country's love his patriot soul possess'd, His country's honour fir'd his filial breast. Her lofty genius, piercing, bright, and bold, Her valour witness'd by the world of old, Witness'd once more by recent heaps of slain On Canada's wild hills, and Minden's plain, To sounds sublimer wak'd his pastoral reed— Peace, Mountain-echoes! while the strains proceed. Amyntor. No more of Tiviot, nor the flowery braes, Where the blythe Shepherd tunes his lightsome lays; No more of Leader's faery-haunted shore, Of Athol's lawns, and Gledswood banks no more. Unheeded smile my country's native charms, Lost in the glory of her arts and arms. These, Shepherds, these demand sublimer strains Than Clyde's clear fountains, or than Athol's plains. Chorus of shepherds. Shepherd, to thee sublimer lays belong, The force divine of soul-commanding song. These humble reeds have little learnt to play, Save the light airs that cheer the pastoral day. Of the clear fountain, and the fruitful plain We sing, as Fancy guides the simple strain. If then thy country's sacred fame demand The high-ton'd music of a happier hand— Shepherd, to thee sublimer lays belong, The force divine of soul-commanding song. Amyntor. In spite of faction's blind, unmanner'd rage, Of various fortune and destructive age, Fair Scotland's honours yet unchang'd are seen, Her palms still blooming, and her laurels green. Freed from the confines of her Gothic grave, When her first light reviving Science gave, Alike o'er Britain shone the liberal ray, From Enswith's A chain of mountains near Folkstone in Kent. mountains to the banks of Tay. For James James the First, King of Scotland, author of the famous old song, entitled Christ's Kirk on the Green. the Muses tun'd their sportive lays, And bound the monarch's brow with Chaucer's bays. Arch Humour smil'd to hear his mimic strain, And plausive Laughter thrill'd thro' every vein. When Taste and Genius form the royal mind, The favour'd arts a happier era find. By James belov'd the Muses tun'd their lyres To nobler strains, and breath'd diviner fires. But the dark mantle of involving Time Has veil'd their beauties, and obscur'd their rhyme. Yet still some pleasing monuments remain, Some marks of genius in each later reign. In nervous strains Dunbar's bold music flows, And Time yet spares the Thistle and the Rose. A poem so called, written in honour of Margaret, daughter of Henry VII. on her marriage to James IV.King of Scots By Mr.William Dunbar. O, while his course the hoary warrior steers Thro' the long range of life-dissolving years, Thro' all the evils of each changeful age, Hate, Envy, Faction, Jealousy, and Rage, Ne'er may his scythe these sacred plants divide, These plants by Heaven in native union tied! Still may the flower its social sweets disclose, The hardy Thistle still defend the Rose! Hail happy days! appeas'd by Margaret's charms, When rival Valour sheath'd his fatal arms; When kindred realms unnatural war supprest, Nor aim'd their arrows at a sister's breast. Kind to the Muse is Quiet's genial day; Her olive loves the foliage of the bay. With bold Dunbar arose a numerous choir Of rival bards that strung the Dorian lyre. In gentle Henryson's Mr. Robert Henryson, an ingenious pastoral poet. unlabour'd strain Sweet Arethusa's shepherd breath'd again. Nor shall your tuneful visions be forgot, Sage Bellentyne, Mr. John Bellentyne, Archdean of Murray, author of beautiful allegorical poem, entitled, Virtue and Vice. and fancy-painting Scott. Mr. Archibald Scott, in the year 1524, translated the Vision, a poem, said to have been written in the year 1360. He was author of the Eagle and the Redbreast also, and several other pieces written with uncommon elegance for their day. But, O my country! how shall Memory trace Thy bleeding anguish, and thy dire disgrace? Weep o'er the ruins of thy blasted bays, Thy glories lost in either Charles's days? When thro' thy fields destructive Rapine spread, Nor sparing infant's tears, nor hoary head. In those dread days the unprotected swain Mourn'd on the mountains o'er his wasted plain. Nor longer vocal with the Shepherd's lay Were Yarrow's banks, or groves of Endermay. Chorus of shepherds. Amyntor, cease! the painful scene forbear, Nor the fond breast of filial duty tear. Yet in our eyes our fathers' sorrows flow, Yet in our bosoms lives their lasting woe. At eve returning from their scanty fold, When the long sufferings of their sires they told, Oft we have sigh'd the piteous tale to hear, And infant wonder dropt the mimic tear. Amyntor. Shepherds, no longer need your sorrows flow, Nor pious duty cherish endless woe. Yet should Remembrance, led by filial love, Thro' the dark vale of old afflictions rove, The mournful shades of sorrows past explore, And think of miseries that are no more; Let those sad scenes that ask the duteous tear, The kind return of happier days endear. Hail, Anna, hail! O may each muse divine With wreaths eternal grace thy holy shrine! Grav'd on thy tomb this sacred verse remain, This verse more sweet than Conquest's sounding strain: “She bade the rage of hostile nations cease, “The glorious arbitress of Europe's peace.” She, thro' whose bosom roll'd the vital tide Of Britain's Monarchs in one stream allied, Clos'd the long jealousies of different sway, And saw united Sister-Realms obey. Auspicious days! when Tyranny no more Rais'd his red arm, nor drench'd his darts in gore. When, long an exile from his native plain, Safe to his fold return'd the weary swain. Return'd, and, many a painful summer past, Beheld the green bench by his door at last. Auspicious days! when Scots, no more opprest, On their free mountains bar'd the fearless breast; With pleasure saw their flocks unbounded feed, And tun'd to strains of ancient joy the reed. Then, Shepherds, did your wondering sires behold A form divine, whose vesture flam'd with gold; His radiant eyes a starry lustre shed, And solar glories beam'd around his head. Like that strange power by fabling poets feign'd, From east to west his mighty arms he strain'd. A rooted olive in one hand he bore, In one a globe, inscrib'd with sea and shore. From Thames's banks to Tweed, to Tay he came, Wealth in his rear, and Commerce was his name. Glad Industry the glorious stranger hails, Rears the tall masts, and spreads the swelling sails; Regions remote with active hope explores, Wild Zembla's hills, and Afric's burning shores. But chief, Columbus, of thy various coast, Child of the Union, Commerce bears his boast. To seek thy new-found worlds, the vent'rous swain, His lass forsaking, left the lowland plain. Aside his crook, his idle pipe he threw, And bade to Music, and to Love adieu. Hence, Glasgow fair, thy wealth-diffusing hand, Thy groves of vessels, and thy crowded strand. Hence, round his folds the moorland Shepherd spies New social towns, and happy hamlets rise. But me not splendor, nor the hopes of gain Should ever tempt to quit the peaceful plain. Shall I, possest of all that life requires, With tutor'd hopes, and limited desires, Change these sweet fields, these native scenes of ease, For climes uncertain, and uncertain seas? Nor yet, fair Commerce, do I thee disdain, Tho' Guilt and Death and Riot swell thy train. Cheer'd by the influence of thy gladdening ray, The liberal arts sublimer works essay. Genius for thee relumes his sacred fires, And Science nearer to her heaven aspires. The sanguine eye of tyranny long clos'd, By Commerce foster'd, and in Peace repos'd, No more her miseries when my country mourn'd, With brighter flames her glowing genius burn'd. Soon wandering fearless many a muse was seen O'er the dun mountain, and the wild wood green. Soon, to the warblings of the pastoral reed, Started sweet Echo from the shores of Tweed. O favour'd stream! where thy fair current flows, The child of nature, gentle Thomson, rose. Young as he wander'd on thy flowery side, With simple joy to see thy bright waves glide, Thither, in all thy native charms array'd, From climes remote the sister Seasons stray'd. Long each in beauty boasted to excel, (For jealousies in sister-bosoms dwell) But now, delighted with the liberal boy, Like Heaven's fair rivals in the groves of Troy, Yield to an humble swain their high debate, And from his voice the palm of beauty wait. Her naked charms, like Venus, to disclose, Spring from her bosom threw the shadowing rose; Bar'd the pure snow that feeds the lover's fire, The breast that thrills with exquisite desire; Assum'd the tender smile, the melting eye, The breath favonian, and the yielding sigh. One beauteous hand a wilding's blossom grac'd, And one fell careless o'er her zoneless waist. Majestic Summer, in gay pride adorn'd, Her rival sister's simple beauty scorn'd. With purple wreathes her lofty brows were bound, With glowing flowers her rising bosom crown'd. In her gay zone, by artful Fancy fram'd, The bright rose blush'd, the full carnation flam'd. Her cheeks the glow of splendid clouds display, And her eyes flash insufferable day. With milder air the gentle Autumn came, But seem'd to languish at her sister's flame. Yet, conscious of her boundless wealth, she bore On high the emblems of her golden store. Yet could she boast the plenty-pouring hand, The liberal smile, benevolent and bland. Nor might she fear in beauty to excel, From whose fair head such golden tresses fell; Nor might she envy Summer's flowery zone, In whose sweet eye the star of evening shone. Next, the pale power, that blots the golden sky, Wreath'd her grim brows, and roll'd her stormy eye; “Behold,” she cried, with voice that shook the ground, (The Bard, the Sisters trembled at the sound) “Ye weak admirers of a grape, or rose, “Behold my wild magnificence of snows! “See my keen frost her glassy bosom bare! “Mock the faint sun, and bind the fluid air! “Nature to you may lend a painted hour, “With you may sport, when I suspend my power. “But you and Nature, who that power obey, “Shall own my beauty, or shall dread my sway.” She spoke: the Bard, whose gentle heart ne'er gave One pain or trouble that he knew to save, No favour'd nymph extols with partial lays, But gives to each her picture for her praise. Mute lies his lyre in death's uncheerful gloom, And Truth and Genius weep at Thomson's tomb. Yet still the Muse's living sounds pervade Her ancient scenes of Caledonian shade. Still Nature listens to the tuneful lay, On Kilda's mountains and in Endermay. Th' ethereal brilliance of poetic fire, The mighty hand that smites the sounding lyre, Strains that on Fancy's strongest pinion rise, Conceptions vast, and thoughts that grasp the skies, To the rapt youth that mus'd on See Mr. Ogilvie's Ode to the Genius of Shakespear. Shakespear's grave, To Ogilvie the muse of Pindar gave. Ode to Time. Ibid. Time, as he sung, a moment ceas'd to fly, And lazy Ode to Sleep. Ibid. Sleep unfolded half his eye. O wake, sweet bard, the Theban lyre again; With ancient valour swell the sounding strain; Hail the high trophies by thy country won, The wreaths that flourish for each valiant son. While Hardyknute frowns red with Norway's gore, Paint her pale matrons weeping on the shore. Hark! the green clarion pouring floods of breath Voluminously loud; high scorn of death Each gallant spirit elates; see Rothsay's thane With arm of mountain oak his firm bow strain! Hark! the string twangs—the whizzing arrow flies: The fierce Norse falls—indignant falls—and dies. O'er the dear urn, where glorious Wallace William Wallace, who, after bravely defending his country against the arms of Edward I. was executed as a rebel, though he had taken no oath of allegiance. sleeps, True Valour bleeds, and patriot Virtue weeps. Son of the lyre, what high ennobling strain, What meed from thee shall generous Wallace gain? Who greatly scorning an Usurper's pride, Bar'd his brave breast for liberty, and died. Boast, Scotland, boast-thy sons of mighty name, Thine ancient chiefs of high heroic fame, Souls that to death their country's foes oppos'd, And life in freedom, glorious freedom clos'd. Where, yet bewail'd, Argyle's warm ashes lie, Let music breathe her most persuasive sigh. To him, what Heaven to man could give, it gave, Wise, generous, honest, eloquent and brave. Genius and Valour for Argyle shall mourn, And his own laurels flourish round his urn. O, may they bloom beneath a fav'ring sky, And in their shade Reproach and Envy die! THE VISIONS OF FANCY. IN FOUR ELEGIES. La raison scait que c'est un songe, Mais elle en saisit les douceurs: Elle a besoin de ces fantômes, Presque tous les plaisirs des hommes Ne sont que de douces errcurs. Gresest. WRITTEN IN 1762. ELEGY I. Children of Fancy, whither are ye fled? Where have ye borne those Hope-enliven'd hours, That once with myrtle garlands bound my head, That once bestrew'd my vernal path with flowers? In yon fair vale, where blooms the beechen grove, Where winds the slow wave thro' the flowery plain, To these fond arms you led the tyrant, Love, With Fear and Hope and Folly in his train. My lyre, that, left at careless distance, hung Light on some pale branch of the osier shade, To lays of amorous blandishment you strung, And o'er my sleep the lulling music play'd. “Rest, gentle youth! while on the quivering breeze “Slides to thine ear this softly breathing strain; “Sounds that move smoother than the steps of ease, “And pour oblivion in the ear of pain. “In this fair vale eternal spring shall smile, “And Time unenvious crown each roscate hour; “Eternal joy shall every care beguile, “Breathe in each gale, and bloom in every flower. “This silver stream, that down its crystal way “Frequent has led thy musing steps along, “Shall, still the same, in sunny mazes play, “And with its murmurs melodise thy song. “Unfading green shall these fair groves adorn; “Those living meads immortal flowers unfold; “In rosy smiles shall rise each blushing morn, “And every evening close in clouds of gold. “The tender Loves that watch thy slumbering rest, “And round thee flowers and balmy myrtles strew, “Shall charm, thro' all approaching life, thy breast, “With joys for ever pure, for ever new. “The genial power that speeds the golden dart, “Each charm of tender passion shall inspire; “With fond affection fill the mutual heart, “And feed the flame of ever-young Desire. “Come, gentle Loves! your myrtle garlands bring; “The smiling bower with cluster'd roses spread; “Come, gentle Airs! with incense-dropping wing “The breathing sweets of vernal odour shed. “Hark, as the strains of swelling music rise, “How the notes vibrate on the fav'ring gale! “Auspicious glories beam along the skies, “And powers unseen the happy moments hail! “Extatic hours! so every distant day “Like this serene on downy wings shall move; “Rise crown'd with joys that triumph o'er decay, “The faithful joys of Fancy and of Love.” ELEGY II. And were they vain, those soothing lays ye sung? Children of Fancy! yes, your song was vain; On each soft air though rapt Attention hung, And Silence listen'd on the sleeping plain. The strains yet vibrate on my ravish'd ear, And still to smile the mimic beauties seem, Though now the visionary scenes appear Like the faint traces of a vanish'd dream. Mirror of life! the glories thus depart Of all that Youth and Love and Fancy frame, When painful Anguish speeds the piercing dart, Or Envy blasts the blooming flowers of Fame. Nurse of wild wishes, and of fond desires, The prophetess of Fortune, false and vain, To scenes where Peace in Ruin's arms expires Fallacious Hope deludes her hapless train. Go, Syren, go—thy charms on others try; My beaten bark at length has reach'd the shore: Yet on the rock my dropping garments lie; And let me perish, if I trust thee more. Come, gentle Quiet! long-neglected maid! O come, and lead me to thy mossy cell; There unregarded in the peaceful shade, With calm Repose and Silence let me dwell. Come happier hours of sweet unanxious rest, When all the struggling passions shall subside; When Peace shall clasp me to her plumy breast, And smooth my silent minutes as they glide. But chief, thou goddess of the thoughtless eye, Whom never cares or passions discompose, O blest Insensibility be nigh, And with thy soothing hand my weary eyelids close. Then shall the cares of love and glory cease, And all the fond anxieties of fame; Alike regardless in the arms of Peace, If these extol, or those debase a name. In Lyttelton though all the Muses praise, His generous praise shall then delight no more, Nor the sweet magic of his tender lays Shall touch the bosom which it charm'd before. Nor then, tho' Malice, with insidious guise Of friendship, ope the unsuspecting breast; Nor then, tho' Envy broach her blackening lies, Shall these deprive me of a moment's rest. O state to be desir'd! when hostile rage Prevails in human more than savage haunts; When man with man eternal war will wage, And never yield that mercy which he wants. When dark Design invades the cheerful hour, And draws the heart with social freedom warm, Its cares, its wishes, and its thoughts to pour, Smiling insidious with the hopes of harm. Vain man, to other's failings still severe, Yet not one foible in himself can find; Another's faults to Folly's eye are clear, But to her own e'en Wisdom's self is blind. O let me still, from these low follies free, This sordid malice, and inglorious strife, Myself the subject of my censure be, And teach my heart to comment on my life. With thee, Philosophy, still let me dwell, My tutor'd mind from vulgar meanness save; Bring Peace, bring Quiet to my humble cell, And bid them lay the green turf on my grave. ELEGY III. Bright o'er the green hills rose the morning ray, The wood-lark's song resounded on the plain; Fair Nature felt the warm embrace of day, And smil'd thro' all her animated reign. When young Delight, of Hope and Fancy born, His head on tufted wild thyme half-reclin'd, Caught the gay colours of the orient morn, And thence of life this picture vain design'd. “O born to thoughts, to pleasures more sublime “Than beings of inferior nature prove! “To triumph in the golden hours of Time, “And feel the charms of fancy and of love! “High-favour'd man! for him unfolding fair “In orient light this native landscape smiles; “For him sweet Hope disarms the hand of care, “Exalts his pleasures, and his grief beguiles. “Blows not a blossom on the breast of Spring, “Breathes not a gale along the bending mead, “Trills not a songster of the soaring wing, “But fragrance, health, and melody succeed. “O let me still with simple Nature live, “My lowly field-flowers on her altar lay, “Enjoy the blessings that she meant to give, “And calmly waste my inoffensive day! “No titled name, no envy-teasing dome, “No glittering wealth my tutor'd wishes crave; “So Health and Peace be near my humble home, “A cool stream murmur, and a green tree wave. “So may the sweet Euterpe not disdain “At Eve's chaste hour her silver lyre to bring; “The muse of pity wake her soothing strain, “And tune to sympathy the trembling string. “Thus glide the pensive moments, o'er the vale “While floating shades of dusky night descend: “Not left untold the lover's tender tale, “Nor unenjoy'd the heart-enlarging friend. “To love and friendship flow the social bowl! “To attic wit and elegance of mind; “To all the native beauties of the soul, “The simple charms of truth, and sense refin'd. “Then to explore whatever ancient sage “Studious from Nature's early volume drew, “To chase sweet Fiction thro' her golden age, “And mark how fair the sun-flower, Science, blew! “Haply to catch some spark of eastern fire, “Hesperian fancy, or Aonian ease; “Some melting note from Sappho's tender lyre, “Some strain that Love and Phœbus taught to please. “When waves the grey light o'er the mountain's head, “Then let me meet the morn's first beauteous ray; “Carelessly wander from my sylvan shed, “And catch the sweet breath of the rising day. “Nor seldom, loitering as I muse along, “Mark from what flower the breeze its sweetness bore; “Or listen to the labour-soothing song “Of bees that range the thymy uplands o'er. “Slow let me climb the mountain's airy brow, “The green height gain'd, in museful rapture lie, “Sleep to the murmur of the woods below, “Or look on Nature with a lover's eye. “Delightful hours! O, thus for ever flow; “Led by fair Fancy round the varied year: “So shall my breast with native raptures glow, “Nor feel one pang from folly, pride, or fear. “Firm be my heart to Nature and to Truth, “Nor vainly wander from their dictates sage: “So Joy shall triumph on the brows of youth, “So Hope shall smooth the dreary paths of age.” ELEGY IV. Oh! yet, ye dear, deluding visions stay! Fond hopes, of Innocence and Fancy born! For you I'll cast these waking thoughts away, For one wild dream of life's romantic morn. Ah! no: the sunshine o'er each object spread By flattering Hope, the flowers that blew so fair, Like the gay gardens of Armida fled, And vanish'd from the powerful rod of Care. So the poor pilgrim, who in rapturous thought Plans his dear journey to Loretto's shrine, Seems on his way by guardian seraphs brought, Sees aiding angels favour his design. Ambrosial blossoms, such of old as blew By those fresh founts on Eden's happy plain, And Sharon's roses all his passage strew: So Fancy dreams; but Fancy's dreams are vain. Wasted and weary on the mountain's side, His way unknown, the hapless pilgrim lies, Or takes some ruthless robber for his guide, And prone beneath his cruel sabre dies. Life's morning-landscape gilt with orient light, Where Hope and Joy and Fancy hold their reign, The grove's green wave, the blue stream sparkling bright, The blythe hours dancing round Hyperion's wain, In radiant colours Youth's free hand pourtrays, Then holds the flattering tablet to his eye; Nor thinks how soon the vernal grove decays, Nor sees the dark cloud gathering o'er the sky. Hence Fancy conquer'd by the dart of Pain, And wandering far from her Platonic shade, Mourns o'er the ruins of her transient reign, Nor unrepining sees her visions fade. Their parent banish'd, hence her children fly, The fairy race that fill'd her festive train; Joy tears his wreath, and Hope inverts her eye, And Folly wonders that her dream was vain. A POEM TO THE MEMORY OF MR. HANDEL. WRITTEN IN 1760. Spirits of music, and ye powers of song, That wak'd to painful melody the lyre Of young Jessides, when, in Sion's vale He wept o'er bleeding friendship; ye that mourn'd, While freedom, drooping o'er Euphrates' stream, Her pensive harp on the pale osier hung, Begin once more the sorrow-soothing lay. Ah! where shall now the Muse fit numbers find? What accents pure to greet thy tuneful shade, Sweet harmonist? 'twas thine, the tender fall Of pity's plaintive lay; for thee the stream Of silver-winding music sweeter play'd, And purer flow'd for thee—all silent now The water-music. Those airs that, breathing o'er the breast of Thames, Led amorous Echo down the long, long vale, Delighted; studious from thy sweeter strain To melodise her own; when fancy-lorn, She mourns in anguish o'er the drooping breast Of young Narcissus. From their amber urns, Rorantesque Comas a Fronte removit ad Aures. Ovid. Met. Parting their green locks streaming in the sun, The Naiads rose and smil'd: nor since the day, When first by music, and by freedom led From Grecian Acidale; nor since the day, When last from Arno's weeping fount they came, To smooth the ringlets of Sabrina's hair, Heard they like minstrelsy—fountains and shades Of Twit'nam, and of Windsor fam'd in song! Ye heights of Clermont, and ye bowers of Ham! That heard the fine strain vibrate thro' your groves, Ah! where were then your long-lov'd Muses fled, When Handel breath'd no more?—and thou, sweet Queen, That nightly wrapt thy Milton's hallow'd ear In the soft ecstacies of Lydian airs; L'Allegro and II Penseroso, set to Music by Mr. Handel. That since attun'd to Handel's high-wound lyre The lay by thee suggested; could'st not thou Sooth with thy sweet song the grim See Milton's Lycidas. fury's breast? Cold-hearted Death! his wanly-glaring eye Nor Virtue's smile attracts, nor Fame's loud trump Can pierce his iron ear, for ever barrd To gentle sounds: the golden voice of song, That charms the gloomy partner of his birth, That soothes Despair and Pain, he hears no more, Than rude winds, blust'ring from the Cambrian cliffs, The traveller's feeble lay. To court fair fame, To toil with slow steps up the star-crown'd hill, Where Science, leaning on her sculptur'd urn, Looks conscious on the secret-working hand Of Nature; on the wings of genius borne, To soar above the beaten walks of life, Is, like the paintings of an evening cloud, Th' amusement of an hour. Night, gloomy night Spreads her black wings, and all the vision dies. Ere long, the heart, that heaves this sigh to thee, Shall beat no more! ere long, on this fond lay Which mourns at Handel's tomb, insulting Time Shall strew his cankering rust. Thy strain, perchance, Thy sacred strain shall the hoar warrior spare; For sounds like thine, at Nature's early birth, Arous'd him slumbering on the dead profound Of dusky chaos; by the golden harps Of choral angels summon'd to his race: And sounds like thine, when Nature is no more, Shall call him weary from the lengthen'd toils Of twice ten thousand years. O would his hand Yet spare some portion of this vital flame, The trembling Muse that now faint effort makes On young and artless wing, should bear thy praise Sublime, above the mortal bounds of earth, With heavenly fire relume her feeble ray, And, taught by Seraphs, frame her song for thee. I feel, I feel the sacred impulse—hark! Wak'd from according lyres the sweet strains flow In symphony divine: from air to air The trembling numbers fly: swift bursts away The flow of joy—now swells the flight of praise. Springs the shrill trump aloft; the toiling chords Melodious labour thro' the flying maze; And the deep base his strong sound rolls away, Majestically sweet—Yet, Handel, raise, Yet wake to higher strains thy sacred lyre: The Name of ages, the Supreme of things, The great Messiah asks it; He whose hand Led into form yon everlasting orbs, The harmony of Nature—He whose hand Stretch'd o'er the wilds of space this beauteous ball, Whose spirit breathes thro' all his smiling works Music and love—yet, Handel, raise the strain. Hark! what angelic sounds, what voice divine Breathes thro' the ravisht air! my rapt ear feels The harmony of Heaven. Hail sacred Choir! Immortal Spirits, hail! If haply those That erst in favour'd Palestine proclaim'd Glory and peace: her angel-haunted groves, Her piny mountains, and her golden vales Re-echo'd peace—But, Oh! suspend the strain— The swelling joy's too much for mortal bounds! Tis transport even to pain. Yet, hark! what pleasing sounds invite mine ear So venerably sweet? 'Tis Sion's lute. Behold her Judas Maccabeus. hero! from his valiant brow Looks Judah's lion, on his thigh the sword Of vanquish'd Apollonius—The shrill trump Thro' Bethoron proclaims th' approaching fight. I see the brave youth lead his little band, With toil and hunger faint; yet from his arm The rapid Syrian flies. Thus Henry once, The British Henry, with his way-worn troop, Subdu'd the pride of France—Now louder blows The martial clangor: lo Nicanor's host! With threat'ning turrets crown'd, slowly advance The ponderous elephants— The blazing sun, from many a golden shield Reflected, gleams afar. Judean chief! How shall thy force, thy little force sustain The dreadful shock! Chorus of youths, in Judas Maccabeus. The hero comes—'Tis boundless mirth and song And dance and triumph; every labouring string, And voice, and breathing shell in concert strain To swell the raptures of tumultuous joy. O master of the passions and the soul, Seraphic Handel! how shall words describe Thy music's countless graces, nameless powers! When See the Oratorio of Samson. he of Gaza, blind, and sunk in chains, On female treachery looks greatly down, How the breast burns indignant! in thy strain, When sweet-volc'd piety resigns to heaven, Glows not each bosom with the flame of virtue? O'er Jephtha's votive maid when the soft lute Sounds the slow symphony of funeral grief, What youthful breast but melts with tender pity? What parent bleeds not with a parent's woe? O, longer than this worthless lay can live! While fame and music sooth the human ear; Be this thy praise: to lead the polish'd mind To Virtue's noblest heights; to light the flame Of British freedom, rouse the generous thought, Refine the passions, and exalt the soul To love, to heaven, to harmony and thee. THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE MIND. EPISTLE I. TO GENERAL CRAUFURD. WRITTEN AT BELVIDERE, 1763. Where is the man, who, prodigal of mind, In one wide wish embraces human kind? All pride of sects, all party zeal above, Whose Priest is Reason, and whose God is Love; Fair Nature's friend, a foe to fraud and art— Where is the man, so welcome to my heart? The sightless herd sequacious, who pursue Dull Folly's path, and do as others do, Who look with purblind prejudice and scorn, On different sects, in different nations born, Let Us, my Craufurd, with compassion view, Pity their pride, but shun their error too. From Belvidere's fair groves, and mountains green, Which Nature rais'd, rejoicing to be seen, Let Us, while raptur'd on her works we gaze, And the heart riots on luxurious praise, Th' expanded thought, the boundless wish retain. And let not Nature moralize in vain. O sacred Guide! preceptress more sublime Than sages boasting o'er the wrecks of time! See on each page her beauteous volume bear The golden characters of good and fair. All human knowledge (blush collegiate pride!) Flows from her works, to none that reads denied. Shall the dull inmate of pedantic walls, On whose old walk the sunbeam seldom falls, Who knows of nature, and of man no more Than fills some page of antiquated lore— Shall he, in words and terms profoundly wise, The better knowledge of the world despise, Think Wisdom center'd in a false degree, And scorn the scholar of Humanity? Something of men these sapient drones may know, Of men that liv'd two thousand years ago. Such human monsters if the world e'er knew, As ancient verse, and ancient story drew! If to one object, system, scene confin'd, The sure effect is narrowness of mind. 'Twas thus St. Robert, in his lonely wood, Forsook each social duty—to be good. Thus Hobbes on one dear system fix'd his eyes, And prov'd his nature wretched—to be wise. Each zealot thus, elate with ghostly pride, Adores his God, and hates the world beside. Tho' form'd with powers to grasp this various ball, Gods! to what meanness may the spirit fall? Powers that should spread in Reason's orient ray, How are they darken'd, and debarr'd the day! When late, where Tajo rolls his ancient tide, Reflecting clear the mountain's purple side, Thy genius, Craufurd, Britain's legions led, And Fear's chill cloud forsook each brightning head, By nature brave, and generous as thou art, Say did not human follies vex thy heart? Glow'd not thy breast indignant, when you saw The dome of Murder consecrate by Law? Where fiends, commission'd with the legal rod, In pure devotion, burn the works of God. O change me, powers of Nature, if ye can, Transform me, make me any thing but man. Yet why? This heart all human kind forgives, While Gillman loves me, and while Craufurd lives. Is Nature, all benevolent, to blame That half her offspring are their mother's shame? Did she ordain o'er this fair scene of things The cruelty of priests, or pride of kings? Tho' worlds lie murder'd for their wealth or fame, Is Nature all-benevolent to blame? O that the world were emptied of its slaves! That all the fools were gone, and all the knaves! Then might we, Craufurd, with delight embrace, In boundless love, the rest of human race. But let not knaves misanthropy create, Nor feed the gall of universal hate. Wherever Genius, Truth, and Virtue dwell, Polish'd in courts, or simple in a cell, All views of country, sects, and creeds apart, These, these I love, and hold them to my heart. Vain of our beauteous isle, and justly vain, For freedom here, and health, and plenty reign, We different lots contemptuously compare, And boast, like children, of a fav'rite's share. Yet tho' each vale a deeper verdure yields Than Arno's banks, or Andalusia's fields, Tho' many a tree-crown'd mountain teems with ore, Tho' flocks innumerous whiten every shore, Why should we, thus with Nature's wealth elate, Behold her different families with hate? Look on her works—on every page you'll find Inscrib'd the doctrine of the social mind. See countless worlds of insect being share Th' unenvied regions of the liberal air! In the same grove what music void of strife! Heirs of one stream what tribes of scaly life! See Earth, and Air, and Fire, and Flood combine Of general good to aid the great design! Where Ancon drags o'er Lincoln's lurid plain, Like a slow snake, his dirty-winding train, Where fogs eternal blot the face of day, And the lost bittern moans his gloomy way; As well we might, for unpropitious skies, The blameless native with his clime despise, As him who still the poorer lot partakes Of Biscay's mountains, or Batavia's lakes. Yet look once more on Nature's various plan! Behold, and love her noblest creature man! She, never partial, on each various zone, Bestow'd some portion, to the rest unknown, By mutual interest meaning thence to bind In one vast chain the commerce of mankind. Behold, ye vain disturbers of an hour! Ye dupes of Faction! and ye tools of Power! Poor rioters on Life's contracted stage! Behold, and lose your littleness of rage! Throw Envy, Folly, Prejudice behind! And yield to Truth the empire of the mind. Immortal Truth! O from thy radiant shrine, Where light created first essay'd to shine; Where clust'ring stars eternal beams display, And gems ethereal drink the golden day; To chase this moral, clear this sensual night, O shed one ray of thy celestial light! Teach us, while wandering thro' this vale below We know but little, that we little know. One beam to mole-ey'd Prejudice convey, Let Pride perceive one mortifying ray. Thy glass to fools, to infidels apply, And all the dimness of the mental eye. Plac'd on this shore of Time's far-stretching bourn, With leave to look at Nature and return; While wave on wave impels the human tide, And ages sink, forgotten as they glide; Can life's short duties better be discharg'd, Than when we leave it with a mind enlarg'd? Judg'd not the old philosopher aright, When thus he preach'd, his pupils in his sight? “It matters not, my friends, how low or high “Your little walk of transient life may lie. “Soon will the reign of Hope and Fear be o'er, “And warring passions militate no more. “And trust me, he who, having once survey'd “The good and fair which Nature's wisdom made, “The soonest to his former state retires, “And feels the peace of satisfied desires, “(Let others deem more wisely if they can), “I look on him to be the happiest man.” So thought the sacred Sage, in whom I trust, Because I feel his sentiments are just. 'Twas not in lustrums of long counted years That swell'd th' alternate reign of hopes and fears; Not in the splendid scenes of pain and strife, That Wisdom plac'd the dignity of life: To study Nature was the task design'd, And learn from her th' enlargement of the mind. Learn from her works whatever Truth admires, And sleep in death with satisfied desires. EPISTLE II. TO WILLIAM LANGHORNE, MA. WRITTEN IN 1765 Light heard his voice, and, eager to obey, From all her orient fountains burst away. At Nature's birth, O! had the power divine Commanded thus the moral sun to shine, Beam'd on the mind all Reason's influence bright, And the full day of intellectual light, Then the free soul, on Truth's strong pinion born, Had never languish'd in this shade forlorn. Yet thus imperfect form'd, thus blind and vain, Doom'd by long toil a glimpse of truth to gain; Beyond its sphere shall human wisdom go, And boldly censure what it cannot know? For what Heav'n gave let us the donor bless, Nor than their merits rank our mercies less. 'Tis ours to cherish what Heav'n deign'd to give, And thankful for the gift of being to live. Progressive powers, and faculties that rise From earth's low vale, to grasp the golden skies, Tho' distant far from perfect, good, or fair, Claim the due thought, and ask the grateful care. Come, then, thou partner of my life and name, From one dear source, whom Nature form'd the same, Ally'd more nearly in each nobler part, And more the friend, than brother, of my heart! Let us, unlike the lucid twins that rise At different times, and shine in distant skies, With mutual eye this mental world survey, Mark the slow rise of intellectual day, View Reason's source, if man the source may find, And trace each science that exalts the mind. “Thou self-appointed Lord of all below! “Ambitious Man, how little dost thou know? “For once let Fancy's towering thoughts subside; “Look on thy birth, and mortify thy pride! “A plaintive wretch, so blind, so helpless born, “The brute sagacious might behold with scorn. “How soon, when Nature gives him to the day, “In strength exulting, does he bound away! “By instinct led, the fostering teat he finds, “Sports in the ray, and shuns the searching winds. “No grief he knows, he feels no groundless fear, “Feeds without cries, and sleeps without a tear. “Did he but know to reason and compare, “See here the vassal, and the master there, “What strange reflections must the scene afford, “That shew'd the weakness of his puling lord!” Thus Sophistry unfolds her specious plan, Form'd not to humble, but depreciate man. Unjust the censure, if unjust to rate His pow'rs and merits from his infant-state. For, grant the children of the flow'ry vale By instinct wiser, and of limbs more hale, With equal eye their perfect state explore, And all the vain comparison's no more. “But why should life, so short by Heav'n ordain'd, “Be long to thoughtless infancy restrain'd— “To thoughtless infancy, or vainly sage, “Mourn through the languors of declining age?” O blind to truth! to Nature's wisdom blind! And all that she directs, or Heav'n design'd! Behold her works in cities, plains, and groves, All life that vegetates, and life that moves! In due proportion, as each being stays In perfect life, it rises and decays. Is Man long helpless? Through each tender hour, See love parental watch the blooming flow'r! By op'ning charms, by beauties fresh display'd, And sweets unfolding, see that love repaid! Has age its pains? For luxury it may— The temp'rate wear insensibly away. While sage experience, and reflection clear Beam a gay sunshine on life's fading year. But see from age, from infant weakness see, That Man was destin'd for society; There from those ills a safe retreat behold, Which young might vanquish, or afflict him old. “That, in proportion as each being stays “In perfect life, it rises and decays— “Is Nature's law—to forms alone confin'd, “The laws of matter act not on the Mind. “Too feebly, sure, its faculties must grow, “And Reason brings her borrow'd light too slow.” O! still censorious? Art thou then possess'd Of Reason's power, and does she rule thy breast? Say what the use—had Providence assign'd To infant years maturity of mind? That thy pert offspring, as their father wise, Might scorn thy precepts, and thy pow'r despise? Or mourn, with ill-match'd faculties at strife, O'er limbs unequal to the task of life? To feel more sensibly the woes that wait On every period, as on every state; And slight, sad convicts of each painful truth, The happier trifles of unthinking youth? Conclude we then the progress of the mind Ordain'd by wisdom infinitely kind: No innate knowledge on the soul imprest, No birth-right instinct acting in the breast, No natal light, no beams from Heav'n display'd, Dart thro' the darkness of the mental shade. Perceptive powers we hold from Heaven's decree, Alike to knowledge as to virtue free, In both a lib'ral agency we bear, The moral here, the intellectual there; And hence in both an equal joy is known, The conscious pleasure of an act our own. When first the trembling eye receives the day, External forms on young perception play; External forms affect the mind alone, Their diff'rent pow'rs and properties unknown. See the pleas'd infant court the flaming brand, Eager to grasp the glory in its hand! The crystal wave as eager to pervade, Stretch its fond arms to meet the smiling shade! When Memory's call the mimic words obey, And wing the thought that faulters on its way; When wise Experience her slow verdict draws, The sure effect exploring in the cause, In Nature's rude, but not unfruitful wild, Reflection springs, and Reason is her child: On her fair stock the blooming scyon grows, And brighter thro' revolving seasons blows. All beauteous flow'r! immortal shalt thou shine, When dim with age yon golden orbs decline; Thy orient bloom, unconscious of decay, Shall spread and flourish in eternal day. O! with what art, my friend, what early care, Should Wisdom cultivate a plant so fair! How should her eye the rip'ning mind revise, And blast the buds of Folly as they rise! How should her hand with industry restrain, The thriving growth of Passion's fruitful train, Aspiring weeds, whose lofty arms would tow'r With fatal shade o'er Reason's tender flow'r. From low pursuits the ductile mind to save, Creeds that contract, and vices that enslave; O'er life's rough seas its doubtful course to steer, Unbroke by av'rice, bigotry, or fear! For this fair Science spreads her light afar, And fills the bright urn of her eastern star. The liberal power in no sequester'd cells, No moonshine courts of dreaming schoolmen dwells; Distinguish'd far her lofty temple stands, Where the tall mountain looks o'er distant lands; All round her throne the graceful arts appear, That boast the empire of the eye or ear. See favour'd first, and nearest to the throne By the rapt mien of musing Silence known, Fled from herself, the Pow'r of Numbers plac'd, Her wild thoughts watch'd by Harmony and Taste. There (but at distance never meant to vie) The full-form'd image glancing on her eye, See lively Painting! On her various face Quick-gliding forms a moment find a place; She looks, she acts the character she gives, And a new feature in each feature lives. See attic ease in Sculpture's graceful air, Half loose her robe, and half unbound her hair; To life, to life, she smiling seems to call, And down her fair hands negligently fall. Last, but not meanest, of the glorious choir, See Music, list'ning to an angel's lyre. Simplicity, their beauteous handmaid, drest By Nature, bears a field-flower on her breast. O Arts divine! O magic Powers that move The springs of truth, enlarging truth, and love! Lost in their charms each mean attachment ends, And Taste and Knowledge thus are Virtue's friends. Thus Nature deigns to sympathize with art, And leads the moral beauty to the heart; There, only there, that strong attraction lies, Which wakes the soul, and bids her graces rise; Lives in those powers of harmony that bind Congenial hearts, and stretch from mind to mind: Glow'd in that warmth, that social kindness gave, Which once—the rest is silence and the grave. O tears, that warm from wounded Friendship flow! O thoughts that wake to monuments of woe! Reflection keen, that points the painful dart; Mem'ry, that speeds its passage to the heart; Sad monitors, your cruel power suspend, And hide, for ever hide, the buried friend: —In vain—confest I see my Craufurd stand, And the pen falls—falls from my trembling hand. E'en Death's dim shadow seeks to hide, in vain, That lib'ral aspect, and that smile humane; E'en Death's dim shadow wears a languid light, And his eye beams thro' everlasting night. 'Till the last sigh of Genius shall expire, His keen eye faded, and extinct his fire, 'Till Time, in league with Envy and with Death, Blast the skill'd hand, and stop the tuneful breath, My Craufurd still shall claim the mournful song, So long remember'd, and bewail'd so long. AN ODE TO THE RIVER EDEN. WRITTEN IN 1759. Delightful Eden! parent stream, Yet shall the maids of Memory say, (When, led by Fancy's fairy dream, My young steps trac'd thy winding way) How oft along thy mazy shore, That many a gloomy alder bore, In pensive thought their Poet stray'd; Or, careless thrown thy bank beside, Beheld thy dimply waters glide, Bright thro' the trembling shade. Yet shall they paint those scenes again, Where once with infant-joy he play'd, And bending o'er thy liquid plain, The azure worlds below survey'd: Led by the rosy-handed Hours, When Time trip'd o'er that bank of flowers, Which in thy chrystal bosom smil'd: Tho' old the God, yet light and gay, He flung his glass, his scythe away, And seem'd himself a child. The poplar tall, that waving near Would whisper to thy murmurs free; Yet rustling seems to soothe mine ear, And trembles when I sigh for thee. Yet seated on thy shelving brim, Can Fancy see the Naiads trim Burnish their green locks in the sun; Or at the last lone hour of day, To chase the lightly glancing fay, In airy circles run. But, Fancy, can thy mimic power Again those happy moments bring? Can'st thou restore that golden hour, When young Joy wav'd his laughing wing? When first in Eden's rosy vale, My full heart pour'd the lover's tale, The vow sincere, devoid of guile! While Delia in her panting breast, With sighs, the tender thought supprest, And look'd as angels smile. O Goddess of the crystal bow, That dwell'st the golden meads among; Whose streams still fair in memory flow, Whose murmurs melodise my song! Oh! yet those gleams of joy display, Which bright'ning glow'd in Fancy's ray. When, near thy lucid urn reclin'd, The dryad, Nature, bar'd her breast, And left, in naked charms imprest, Her image on my mind. In vain—the maids of Memory fair No more in golden visions play; No friendship smoothes the brow of Care, No Delia's smile approves my lay. Yet, love and friendship lost to me, 'Tis yet some joy to think of thee, And in thy breast this moral find; That life, tho' stain'd with Sorrow's showers, Shall flow serene, while Virtue pours Her sunshine on the mind. AUTUMNAL ELEGY. TO MISS CRACROFT. 1763. While yet my poplar yields a doubtful shade, Its last leaves trembling to the Zephyr's sigh; On this fair plain ere every verdure fade, Or the last smiles of golden Autumn die; Wilt thou, my Nancy, at this pensive hour, O'er Nature's ruin hear they friend complain; While his heart labours with th' inspiring power, And from his pen spontaneous flows the strain? Thy gentle breast shall melt with kindred sighs, Yet haply grieving o'er a Parent's bier; Poets are Nature's children; when she dies, Affection mourns, and Duty drops a tear. Why are ye silent, brethren of the grove, Fond Philomel, thy many-chorded lyre So sweetly tun'd to tenderness and love, Shall love no more, or tenderness inspire? O mix once more thy gentle lays with mine; For well our passions, well our notes agree: An absent love, sweet bird, may soften thine; An absent love demands a tear from me. Yet, ere ye slumber, songsters of the sky, Thro' the long night of winter wild and drear: O let us tune, ere Love and Fancy die, One tender farewell to the fading year. Farewell ye wild hills, scatter'd o'er with spring! Sweet solitudes, where Flora smil'd unseen! Farewell each breeze of balmy-burthen'd wing! The violet's blue bank, and the tall wood green! Ye tuneful groves of Belvidere, adieu! Kind shades that whisper o'er my Craufurd's rest! From courts, from senates and from camps to you, When Fancy leads him, no inglorious guest. Dear shades adieu! where late the moral Muse, Led by the dryad, Silence, oft reclin'd, Taught Meanness to extend her little views, And look on Nature to enlarge her mind. Farewell the walk along the woodland-vale! Flower-feeding rills in murmurs drawn away! Farewell the sweet breath of the early gale! And the dear glories of the closing day! The nameless charms of high, poetic thought, That Spring's green hours to Fancy's children bore; The words divine, Imagination wrote On Slumber's light leaf by the murmuring shore— All, all adieu! From Autumn's sober power Fly the dear dreams of Spring's delightful reign; Gay Summer strips her rosy-mantled bower, And rude winds waste the glories of her train. Yet Autumn yields her joys of humbler kind; Sad o'er her golden ruins as we stray, Sweet Melancholy soothes the musing mind, And Nature charms, delightful in decay. All-bounteous power, whom happy worlds adore! With every scene some grateful change she brings— In Winter's wild snows, Autumn's golden store, In glowing Summers and in blooming Springs! O most belov'd! the fairest and the best Of all her works! may still thy lover find Fair Nature's frankness in thy gentle breast; Like her be various, but like her be kind. Then, when the spring of smiling youth is o'er; When Summer's glories yield to Autumn's sway; When golden Autumn sinks in Winter hoar, And life declining yields its last weak ray; In thy lov'd arms my fainting age shall close, On thee my fond eye bend its trembling light: Rememb'rance sweet shall soothe my last repose, And my soul bless thee in eternal night. TO MISS CRACROFT. 1763. When pale beneath the frowning shade of death, No soothing voice of love, or friendship nigh, While strong convulsions seiz'd the lab'ring breath, And life suspended left each vacant eye; Where, in that moment, fled th' immortal mind? To what new region did the spirit stray? Found it some bosom hospitably kind, Some breast that took the wanderer in its way? To thee, my Nancy, in that deathful hour, To thy dear bosom it once more return'd; And wrapt in Hackthorn's solitary bower, The ruins of its former mansion mourn'd. But, didst thou, kind and gentle as thou art, O'er thy pale lover shed the generous tear? From those sweet eyes did Pity's softness start, When Fancy laid him on the lowly bier? Didst thou to Heaven address the forceful prayer, Fold thy fair hands, and raise the mournful eye, Implore each power benevolent to spare, And call down pity from the golden sky? O born at once to bless me and to save, Exalt my life, and dignify my lay! Thou too shalt triumph o'er the mouldering grave, And on thy brow shall bloom the deathless bay. Dear shades of genius! heirs of endless fame! That in your laureate crowns the myrtle wove, Snatch'd from oblivion Beauty's sacred name, And grew immortal in the arms of Love! O may we meet you in some happier clime, Some safer vale beneath a genial sky; Whence all the woes that load the wing of time, Disease, and death, and fear, and frailty fly! THE COMPLAINT OF HER RING-DOVE. TO MISS CRACROFT. 1759. Far from the smiles of blue hesperian skies, Far from those vales, where flowery pleasures dwell, (Dear scenes of freedom lost to these sad eyes!) How hard to languish in this lonely cell! When genial gales relume the fires of love, When laughing Spring leads round the jocund year; Ah! view with pity, gentle maid, your dove, From every heart-felt joy secluded here! To me no more the laughing Spring looks gay; Nor annual loves relume my languid breast; Time slowly drags the long, delightless day, Thro' one dull scene of solitary rest. Ah! what avails that dreaming Fancy roves Thro' the wild beauties of her native reign! Breathes in green fields, and feeds in freshening groves, To wake to anguish in this hopeless chain? Tho' fondly sooth'd with Pity's tenderest care, Tho' still by Nancy's gentle hand carest, For the free forest, and the boundless air, The rebel, Nature, murmurs in my breast. Ah let not Nature, Nancy, plead in vain! For kindness sure should grace a form so fair: Restore me to my native wilds again, To the free forest, and the boundless air. SONNET IN THE MANNER OF PETRARCH. TO MISS CRACROFT. 1765. On thy fair morn, O hope-inspiring May! The sweetest twins that ever Nature bore, Where Hackthorn's vale her field-flower-garland wore, Young Love and Fancy met the genial day. And, all as on the thyme-green bank I lay, A nymph of gentlest mien their train before, Came with a smile; and Swain, she cried, no more To pensive sorrow tune thy hopeless lay. Friends of thy heart, see Love and Fancy bring Each joy that youth's enchanted bosom warms! Delight that rifles all the fragrant spring! Fair-handed Hope, that paints unfading charms! And dove-like Faith, that waves her silver wing.— These, Swain, are thine; for Nancy meets thy arms. WRAPPED ROUND A NOSEGAY OF VIOLETS. TO MISS CRACROFT. 1761. Dear object of my late and early prayer! Source of my joy! and solace of my care! Whose gentle friendship such a charm can give, As makes me wish, and tells me how to live. To thee the Muse with grateful hand would bring These first fair children of the doubtful Spring. O may they, fearless of a varying sky, Bloom on thy breast, and smile beneath thine eye! In fairer lights their vivid blue display, And sweeter breathe their little lives away! ON THE MORAL REFLECTIONS CONTAINED IN HER ANSWER TO THE ABOVE VERSES. TO MISS CRACROFT. 1761. Sweet moralist! whose moving truths impart At once delight and anguish to my heart! Tho' human joys their short-liv'd sweets exhale Like the wan beauties of the wasted vale; Yet trust the Muse, fair friendship's flower shall last, When life's short sunshine, like its storms is past; Bloom in the fields of some ambrosial shore, Where Time, and Death, and Sickness are no more. WRITTEN IN A COLLECTION OF MAPS. 1765. Realms of this globe, that ever-circling run, And rise alternate to embrace the sun; Shall I with envy at my lot repine, Because I boast so small a portion mine? If e'er in thought of Andalusia's vines, Golconda's jewels, or Potosi's mines; In these, or those, if vanity forgot The humbler blessings of my little lot; Then may the stream that murmurs near my door, The waving grove that loves its mazy shore, Withhold each soothing pleasure that they gave, No longer murmur, and no longer wave! THEODOSIUS TO CONSTANTIA. 1760. Let others seek the lying aids of art, And bribe the passions to betray the heart; Truth, sacred Truth, and Faith unskill'd to feign, Fill my fond breast, and prompt my artless strain. Say, did thy lover, in some happier hour, Each ardent thought, in wild profusion pour? With eager fondness on thy beauty gaze, And talk with all the ecstasy of praise? The heart sincere its pleasing tumult prov'd; All, all declar'd that Theodosius lov'd. Let raptur'd Fancy on that moment dwell, When thy dear vows in trembling accents fell; When Love acknowledg'd wak'd the tender sigh, Swell'd thy full breast, and fill'd thy melting eye. O! blest for ever be th' auspicious day, Dance all its hours in pleasure's golden ray! Pale sorrow's gloom from every eye depart! And laughing joy glide lightly thro' the heart! Let village-maids their festive brows adorn, And with fresh garlands meet the smiling morn; Each happy swain, by faithful Love repaid, Pour his warm vows, and court his village maid. Yet shall the scene to ravish'd memory rise; Constantia present yet shall meet these eyes; On her fair arm her beauteous head reclin'd, Her locks flung careless to the sportful wind. While Love, and Fear, contending in her face, Flush every rose, and heighten every grace. O, never, while of life and hope possest, May this dear image quit my faithful breast! The painful hours of absence to beguile, May thus Constantia look, Constantia smile! ELEGY. 1760. The eye of Nature never rests from care; She guards her children with a parent's love; And not a mischief reigns in earth or air, But time destroys, or remedies remove. In vain no ill shall haunt the walks of life, No vice in vain the human heart deprave, The pois'nous flower, the tempest's raging strife From greater pain, from greater ruin save. Lavinia, form'd with every powerful grace, With all that lights the flame of young desire; Pure ease of wit, and elegance of face, A soul all fancy, and an eye all fire. Lavinia!—Peace, my busy, fluttering breast! Nor fear to languish in thy former pain: At length she yields—she yields the needful rest; And frees her lover from his galling chain. The golden star, that leads the radiant morn, Looks not so fair, fresh-rising from the main; But her bent eye-brow bears forbidding scorn,— But Pride's fell furies every heart-string strain. Lavinia, thanks to thy ungentle mind; I now behold thee with indifferent eyes; And Reason dares, tho' Love as Death be blind, Thy gay, thy worthless being to despise. Beauty may charm without one inward grace, And fair proportions win the captive heart; But let rank pride the pleasing form debase, And Love disgusted breaks his erring dart. The youth that once the sculptur'd nymph admir'd, Had look'd with scornful laughter on her charms, If the vain form, with recent life inspir'd, Had turn'd disdainful from his offer'd arms. Go, thoughtless maid! of transient beauty vain, Feed the high thought, the towering hope extend; Still may'st thou dream of splendor in thy train, And smile superb, while love and flattery bend. For me, sweet peace shall soothe my troubled mind, And easy slumbers close my weary eyes; Since Reason dares, tho' Love as Death be blind, Thy gay, thy worthless being to despise. INSCRIPTION ON THE DOOR OF A STUDY. O thou that shalt presume to tread This mansion of the mighty dead, Come with the free, untainted mind; The nurse, the pedant leave behind; And all that superstition, fraught With folly's lore, thy youth has taught— Each thought that reason can't retain,— Leave it, and learn to think again. Yet, while thy studious eyes explore, And range these various volumes o'er, Trust blindly to no fav'rite pen, Remembering authors are but men. Has fair Philosophy thy love? Away! she lives in yonder grove. If the sweet Muse thy pleasure gives;— With her in yonder grove she lives: And if Religion claims thy care; Religion, fled from books, is there. For first from Nature's works we drew Our knowledge, and our virtue too. TO LORD GRANBY. In spite of all the rusty fools That clean old nonsense in the schools; Nature, a mistress never coy, Has wrote on all her works—Enjoy. Shall we, then, starve, like Gideon's wife, And die to save a makeweight's life? No, friend of Nature, you disdain So fair a hand shou'd work in vain. But, good my Lord, make her your guide. And err not on the other side: Like her, in all you deign to do, Be liberal, but be sparing too. When sly Sir Toby, night by night, With his dear bags regales his sight; And conscience, reason, pity sleep, Tho' virtue pine, tho' merit weep; I see the keen reproaches fly Indignant from your honest eye; Each bounteous wish glows unconfin'd, And your breast labours to be kind. At this warm hour, my Lord, beware The servile Flatterer's specious snare, The fawning Sycophant, whose art Marks the kind motions of the heart; Each idle, each insidious knave, That acts the graceful, wise, or brave. With festive board, and social eye, You've seen old Hospitality; Mounted astride the moss-grown wall, The genius of the ancient hall. So reverend, with such courtly glee, He serv'd your noble ancestry; And turn'd the hinge of many a gate, For Russel, Rous, Plantagenet. No lying porter levied there, His dues on all imported ware; There, rang'd in rows, no liveried train E'er begg'd their master's beef again; No Flatterer's planetary face Plied for a bottle, or a place, Toad-eating France, and fiddling Rome Kept their lean rascals starv'd at home. “Thrice happy days!” In this, 'tis true, Old times were better than the new; Yet some egregious faults you'll see In ancient Hospitality. See motley crowds, his roof beneath, Put poor Society to death! Priests, knights and 'squires debating wild, On themes unworthy of a child; 'Till the strange compliment commences, To praise their host, and lose their senses. Go then, my Lord! keep open hall; Proclaim your table free for all; Go, sacrifice your time, your wealth, Your patience, liberty, and health, To such a thought-renouncing crew, Such foes to care—e'en care for you. “Heav'ns! and are these the plagues that wait “Around the hospitable gate?— “Let tenfold iron bolt my door, “And the gaunt mastiff growl before; “There, not one human creature nigh, “Save, dear Sir Toby, you and I, “In cynic silence let us dwell; “Ye plagues of social life, farewel!” Displeases this? The modern way, Perhaps, may please—a public day. “A public day! detested name! “The farce of friendship and the shame. “Did ever social freedom come “Within the pale of drawing-room? “See pictur'd round the formal crowd! “How nice, how just each attitude! “My Lord approaches—what surprise! “The pictures speak, the pictures rise! “Thrice ten times told the same salute, “Once more the mimic forms are mute. “Mean while the envious rows between, “Distrust and Scandal walk unseen; “Their poisons silently infuse, “'Till these suspect, and those abuse. “Far, far from these, in some lone shade, “Let me, in easy silence laid, “Where never fools, or slaves intrude, “Enjoy the sweets of solitude!” What! quit the commerce of mankind! Leave virtue, fame, and worth behind! Who fly to solitary rest, Are Reason's savages at best. Tho' human life's extensive field Wild weeds, and vexing brambles yield; Behold her smiling vallies bear Mellifluous fruits, and flowrets fair! The crowds of folly you despise— Associate with the good and wise; For virtue, rightly understood, Is to be wise, and to be good. MONODY. 1759. Ah scenes belov'd! ah conscious shades, That wave these parent-vales along! Ye bowers where Fancy met the tuneful maids, Ye mountains vocal with my Doric song, Teach your wild echoes to complain In sighs of solemn woe, in broken sounds of pain. For her I mourn, Now the cold tenant of the thoughtless urn— For her bewail these strains of woe, For her these filial sorrows flow, Source of my life, that led my tender years, With all a parent's pious fears, That nurs'd my infant thought, and taught my mind to grow. Careful, she mark'd each dangerous way, Where youth's unwary footsteps stray: She taught the struggling passions to subside; Where sacred truth, and reason guide, In virtue's glorious path to seek the realms of day. Lamented goodness! yet I see The fond affections melting in her eye: She bends its tearful orb on me, And heaves the tender sigh: As thoughtful, she the toils surveys, That crowd in life's perplexing maze, And for her children feels again All, all that love can fear, and all that fear can feign. O best of parents! let me pour My sorrows o'er thy silent bed; There early strew the vernal flower, The parting tear at evening shed— Alas! are these the only meed Of each kind thought, each virtaous deed, These fruitless offerings that embalm the dead? Then, fairy-featur'd Hope, forbear— No more thy fond illusions spread: Thy shadowy scenes dissolv'd in air, Thy visionary prospects fled; With her they fled, at whose lamented shrine Love, gratitude, and duty mingled tears, Condemn'd each filial office to resign, Nor hopeful more to soothe her long-declining years. TO MRS.? IN TEARS FOR THE DEATH OF A FRIEND. 1762. So feeble Nature weeps o'er friendship's grave, And mourns the rigour of that law she gave: Yet, why not weep? When in that grave expire All Pembroke's elegance, all Waldegrave's fire. No more those eyes in soft effulgence move, No more that bosom feels the spark of love. O'er those pale cheeks the drooping graces mourn, And Fancy tears her wild wreath o'er that urn. There Hope at Heaven once cast a doubtful eye, Content repin'd, and Patience stole a sigh. Fair Friendship griev'd o'er ?'s sacred bier, And Virtue wept, for ? dropt a tear. TO MRS. GILLMAN. With sense enough for half your sex beside, With just no more than necessary pride; With knowledge caught from Nature's living page, Politely learn'd, and elegantly sage— Alas! how piteous, that in such a mind So many foibles free reception find! Can such a mind, ye gods! admit disdain? Be partial, envious, covetous, and vain? Unwelcome Truth! to love, to blindness clear! Yet, Gillman, bear it;—while you blush to hear. That in your gentle breast Disdain can dwell, Let knavery, meanness, pride that feel it, tell! With partial eye a friend's defects you see, And look with kindness on my faults and me. And does no Envy that fair mind o'er-shade? Does no short sigh for greater wealth invade; When silent merit wants the fostering meed, And the warm wish suggests the virtuous deed? Fairly the charge of vanity you prove, Vain of each virtue of the friends you love. What charms, what arts of magic have conspir'd Of power to make so many faults admir'd? FRAGMENT, WRITTEN AT CLARE-HALL ON THE KING's ACCESSION. 1760. While every gale the voice of triumph brings, And smiling Victory waves her purple wings; While earth and ocean yield their subject powers, Neptune his waves and Cybele her towers; Yet will you deign the Muse's voice to hear, And let her welcome greet a Monarch's ear? Yes; midst the toils of glory ill-repaid, Oft has the Monarch sought her soothing aid. See Frederic court her in the rage of war, Tho' rapid vengeance urge his hostile car: With her repos'd in philosophic rest, The sage's sunshine smooths the warrior's breast. Whate'er Arcadian fancy feign'd of old Of halcyon days, and minutes plum'd with gold; Whate'er adorn'd the wisest, gentlest reign, From you she hopes—let not her hopes be vain! Rise, ancient suns! advance, Pierian days! Flow, Attic streams! and spring, Aonian bays! Cam, down thy wave in brisker mazes glide, And see new honours crown thy hoary side! Thy osiers old see myrtle groves succeed! And the green laurel meet the waving reed! CÆSAR's DREAM, BEFORE HIS INVASION OF BRITAIN. 1758. When rough Helvetia's hardy sons obey, And vanquish'd Belgia bows to Cæsar's sway; When, scarce-beheld, embattled nations fall, The fierce Sicambrian, and the faithless Gaul; Tir'd Freedom leads her savage sons no more, But flies, subdued, to Albion's utmost shore. 'Twas then, while stillness grasp'd the sleeping air, And dewy slumbers seal'd the eye of care; Divine Ambition to her votary came: Her left hand waving, bore the trump of fame; Her right a regal sceptre seem'd to hold, With gems far-blazing from the burnish'd gold. And thus, “My Son,” the Queen of Glory said; “Immortal Cæsar, raise thy languid head. “Shall Night's dull chains the man of counsels bind? “Or Morpheus rule the monarch of mankind? “See worlds unvanquish'd yet await thy sword! “Barbaric lands, that scorn a Latian lord! “See yon proud isle, whose mountains meet the sky, “Thy foes encourage, and thy power defy! “What, tho' by Nature's firmest bars secur'd, “By seas encireled, and with rocks immur'd, “Shall Cæsar shrink the greatest toils to brave, “Scale the high rock, or beat the maddening wave?” She spoke—her words the warrior's breast inflame With rage indignant, and with conscious shame; Already beat, the swelling floods give way, And the fell genii of the rocks obey: Already shouts of triumph rend the skies, And the thin rear of barbarous nations flies. Quick round their chief his active legions stand, Dwell on his eye, and wait the waving hand. The Hero rose, majestically slow, And look'd attention to the crowds below. ‘Romans and Friends! is there who seeks for rest. ‘By labours vanquish'd, and with wounds opprest? ‘That respite Cæsar shall with pleasure yield, ‘Due to the toils of many a well-fought field. ‘Is there who shrinks at thought of dangers past, ‘The ragged mountain, or the pathless waste— ‘While savage hosts, or savage floods oppose, ‘Or shivering fancy pines in Alpine snows? ‘Let him retire to Latium's peaceful shore; ‘He once has toil'd, and Cæsar asks no more. ‘Is there a Roman, whose unshaken breast ‘No pains have conquer'd, and no fears deprest? ‘Who, doom'd thro' Death's dread ministers to go, ‘Dares to chastise the insults of a foe; ‘Let him, his country's glory and her stay, ‘With reverence hear her, and with pride obey. ‘A form divine, in heavenly splendor bright, ‘Whose look threw radiance round the pall of night, ‘With calm severity approach'd and said, “Wake thy dull ear, and lift thy languid head. “What! shall a Roman sink in soft repose, “And tamely see the Britons aid his foes? “See them secure the rebel Gaul supply; “Spurn his vain eagles and his power defy? “Go! burst their barriers, obstinately brave; “Scale the wild rock, and beat the maddening wave.” Here paus'd the Chief, but waited no reply, The voice assenting spoke from every eye; Nor, as the kindness that reproach'd with fear, Were dangers dreadful, or were toils severe. INSCRIPTION IN A TEMPLE OF SOCIETY. Sacred rise these walls to thee, Blithe-eyed nymph, Society! In whose dwelling, free and fair, Converse smoothes the brow of care. Who, when waggish Wit betray'd To his arms a sylvan maid, All beneath a myrtle tree, In some vale of Arcady, Sprung, I ween, from such embrace, The lovely contrast in her face. Perchance, the Muses as they stray'd, Seeking other spring, or shade, On the sweet child cast an eye In some vale of Arcady; And blithest of the sisters three, Gave her to Euphrosyne. The grace, delighted, taught her care The cordial smile, the placid air; How to chase, and how restrain All the fleet, ideal train; How with apt words well-combin'd, To dress each image of the mind— Taught her how they disagree, Awkward fear and modesty, And freedom and rusticity. True politeness how to know From the superficial shew; From the coxcomb's shallow grace, And the many-modell'd face: That Nature's unaffected ease More than studied forms would please— When to check the sportive vein; When to Fancy yield the rein; On the subject when to be Grave or gay, reserv'd or free: The speaking air, th' impassion'd eye, The living soul of symmetry; And that soft sympathy which binds In magic chains congenial minds. INSCRIPTION IN A SEQUESTERED GROTTO. 1763. Sweet peace, that lov'st the silent hour, The still retreat of leisure free; Associate of each gentle power, And eldest born of harmony! O, if thou own'st this mossy cell, If thine this mansion of repose; Permit me, nymph, with thee to dwell, With thee my wakeful eye to close. And tho' those glittering scenes should fade, That Pleasure's rosy train prepares; What vot'ry have they not betray'd? What are they more than splendid cares? But smiling days, exempt from care, But nights, when sleep, and silence reign; Serenity, with aspect fair, And love and joy are in thy train. ANOTHER INSCRIPTION IN THE SAME GROTTO. 1756. O Fairest of the village-born, Content, inspire my careless lay! Let no vain wish, no thought forlorn Throw darkness o'er the smiling day. Forget'st thou, when we wander'd o'er The sylvan Beleau's A small river in Westmorland. sedgy shore, Or rang'd the woodland wilds along; How oft on Herclay's A romantic village in the abovementioned county, formerly the seat of the Herclays, earls of Carlisle. mountains high We've met the morning's purple eye, Delay'd by many a song? From thee, from those by fortune led; To all the farce of life confin'd; At once each native pleasure fled, For thou, sweet nymph, wast left behind. Yet could I once, once more survey Thy comely form in mantle grey, Thy polish'd brow, thy peaceful eye; Where e'er, forsaken fair, you dwell, Tho' in this dim sequester'd cell, With thee I'd live and die. LEFT WITH THE MINISTER OF RIPONDEN, A ROMANTIC VILLAGE IN YORKSHIRE. 1758. Thrice happy you, whoe'er you are, From life's low cares secluded far, In this sequester'd vale!— Ye rocks on precipices pil'd! Ye ragged desarts, waste and wild! Delightful horrors, hail! What joy within these sunless groves, Where lonely Contemplation roves, To rest in fearless ease! Save weeping rills, to see no tear, Save dying gales, no sigh to hear, No murmur, but the breeze. Say, would you change that peaceful cell, Where Sanctity and Silence dwell, For Splendor's dazzling blaze? For all those gilded toys that glare Round high-born power's imperial chair, Inviting fools to gaze? Ah friend! Ambition's prospects close, And, studious of your own repose, Be thankful here to live: For, trust me, one protecting shed, And nightly peace, and daily bread Is all that life can give. WRITTEN AMONG THE RUINS OF PONTEFRACT CASTLE. 1756. Right sung the bard, that all-involving age, With hand impartial deals the ruthless blow; That war, wide-wasting, with impetuous rage, Lays the tall spire, and sky-crown'd turret low. A pile stupendous, once of fair renown, This mould'ring mass of shapeless ruin rose, Where nodding heights of fractur'd columns frown, And birds obscene in ivy-bow'rs repose: Oft the pale matron from the threat'ning wall, Suspicious, bids her heedless children fly; Oft, as he views the meditated fall, Full swiftly steps the frighted peasant by. But more respectful views th' historic sage, Musing, these awful relics of decay, That once a refuge form'd from hostile rage, In Henry's and in Edward's dubious day. He pensive oft reviews the mighty dead, That erst have trod this desolated ground; Reflects how here unhappy Sal'sbury bled, When faction aim'd the death-dispensing wound. Rest, gentle Rivers! and ill-fated Gray! A flow'r or tear oft strews your humble grave, Whom Envy slew, to pave Ambition's way, And whom a Monarch wept in vain to save. Ah! what avail'd th' alliance of a throne? The pomp of titles what, or pow'r rever'd? Happier! to these the humble life unknown, With virtue honour'd, and by peace endear'd. Had thus the sons of bleeding Britain thought, When hapless here inglorious Richard lay, Yet many a prince, whose blood full dearly bought The shameful triumph of the long-fought day; Yet many a hero, whose defeated hand In death resign'd the well-contested field, Had in his offspring sav'd a sinking land, The Tyrant's terror, and the Nation's shield. Ill could the Muse indignant grief forbear, Should Mem'ry trace her bleeding Country's woes; Ill could she count, without a bursting tear, Th' inglorious triumphs of the vary'd Rose! While York, with conquest and revenge elate, Insulting, triumphs on St. Alban's plain, Who views, nor pities Henry's hapless fate, Himself a captive, and his leaders slain? Ah prince! unequal to the toils of war, To stem ambition, Faction's rage to quell; Happier! from these had Fortune plac'd thee far, In some lone convent, or some peaceful cell. For what avail'd that thy victorious queen Repair'd the ruins of that dreadful day? That vanquish'd York, on Wakefield's purple green, Prostrate amidst the common slaughter lay: In vain fair Vict'ry beam'd the gladd'ning eye, And, waving oft her golden pinions, smil'd; Full soon the flatt'ring goddess meant to fly, Full rightly deem'd unsteady Fortune's child. Let Towton's field—but cease the dismal tale: For much its horrors would the muse appal, In softer strains suffice it to bewail The Patriot's exile, or the Heroe's fall. Thus silver wharf, A river near the scene of battle, in which were slain 35,000 men. whose crystal-sparkling urn Reflects the brilliance of his blooming shore, Still melancholy-mazing, seems to mourn, But rolls, confus'd, a crimson wave no more. PRECEPTS OF CONJUGAL HAPPINESS. Friend, sister, partner of that gentle heart Where my soul lives, and holds her dearest part; While love's soft raptures these gay hours employ, And time puts on the yellow robe of joy; Will you, Maria, mark with patient ear The moral Muse, nor deem her song severe? Through the long course of Life's unclouded day, Where sweet contentment smiles on Virtue's way; Where Fancy opes her ever-varying views, And Hope strews flowers, and leads you as she strews; May each fair pleasure court thy favour'd breast, By truth protected, and by love caress'd! So Friendship vows, nor shall her vows be vain; For every pleasure comes in Virtue's train; Each charm that tender sympathies impart, The glow of soul, the transports of the heart, Sweet meanings, that in silent truth convey Mind into mind, and steal the soul away, These gifts, O Virtue, these are all thy own; Lost to the vicious, to the vain unknown! Yet blest with these, and happier charms than these, By Nature form'd, by genius taught to please, E'en you, to prove that mortal gifts are vain, Must yield your human sacrifice to pain; The wizard Care shall dim those brilliant eyes, Smite the fair urns, and bid the waters rise. With mind unbroke that darker hour to bear, Nor, once his captive, drag the chains of Care, Hope's radiant sunshine o'er the scene to pour, Nor future joys in present ills devour, These arts your philosophic friend may shew, Too well experienc'd in the school of woe. In some sad hour, by transient grief opprest, Ah! let not vain reflection wound your breast! For memory, then, to happier objects blind, Though once the friend, the traitor of the mind, Life's varied sorrows studious to explore, Turns the sad volume of its sufferings o'er. Still to the distant prospect stretch your eye, Pass the dim cloud, and view the brightening sky; On Hope's kind wing, more genial climes survey, Let Fancy join, but Reason guide your way, For Fancy, still to tender woes inclin'd, May sooth the heart, but misdirects the mind. The source of half our anguish, half our tears, Is the wrong conduct of our hopes and fears; Like ill-train'd children, still their treatment such, Restrain'd too rashly, or indulg'd too much. Hence Hope, projecting more than life can give, Would live with angels, or refuse to live; Hence spleen-ey'd Fear, o'er-acting Caution's part, Betrays those succours Reason lends the heart. Yet these, submitted to fair Truth's controul, These tyrants are the servants of the soul; Through vales of peace the dove-like Hope shall stray, And bear at eve her olive branch away, In every scene some distant charm descry, And hold it forward to the brightening eye; While watchful Fear, if Fortitude maintain Her trembling steps, shall ward the distant pain. Should erring Nature casual faults disclose, Wound not the breast that harbours your repose: For every grief that breast from you shall prove, Is one link broken in the chain of love. Soon, with their objects, other woes are past, But pains from those we love are pains that last. Though faults or follies from Reproach may fly, Yet in its shade the tender passions die. Love, like the flower that courts the Sun's kind ray, Will flourish only in the smiles of day; Distrust's cold air the generous plant annoys, And one chill blight of dire contempt destroys. O shun, my friend, avoid that dangerous coast, Where peace expires, and fair affection's lost; By wit, by grief, by anger urg'd, forbear The speech contemptuous, and the scornful air. If heart-felt quiet, thoughts unmixt with pain, While peace weaves flowers o'er Hymen's golden chain, If tranquil days, if hours of smiling ease, The sense of pleasure, and the power to please, If charms like these deserve your serious care, Of one dark foe, one dangerous foe beware! Like Hecla's mountain, while his heart's in flame, His aspect's cold, and Jealousy's his name. His hideous birth his wild disorders prove, Begot by Hatred on despairing Love! Her throes in rage the frantic mother bore, And the fell sire with angry curses tore His sable hair—Distrust beholding smil'd, And lov'd her image in her future child. With cruel care, industrious to impart Each painful sense, each soul-tormenting art, To Doubt's dim shrine her hapless charge she led, Where never sleep reliev'd the burning head, Where never grateful fancy sooth'd suspense, Or the sweet charm of easy confidence. Hence fears eternal, ever-restless care, And all the dire associates of despair. Hence all the woes he found that peace destroy, And dash with pain the sparkling stream of joy. When love's warm breast, from rapture's trembling height, Falls to the temperate measures of delight; When calm delight to easy friendship turns, Grieve not that Hymen's tore more gently burns. Unerring Nature, in each purpose kind, Forbids long transports to usurp the mind; For, oft dissolv'd in joy's oppressive ray, Soon would the finer faculties decay. True tender love one even tenor keeps; 'Tis reason's flame, and burns when passion sleeps. The charm connubial, like a stream that glides Through life's fair vale, with no unequal tides, With many a plant along its genial side, With many a flower that blows in beauteous pride, With many a shade, where peace in rapturous rest Holds sweet affiance to her fearless breast, Pure in its source, and temperate in its way, Still flows the same, nor finds its urn decay. O bliss beyond what lonely life can know, The soul-felt sympathy of joy and woe! That magic charm which makes e'en sorrow dear, And turns to pleasure the partaken tear! Long, beauteous friend, to you may Heaven impart The soft endearments of the social heart! Long to your lot may every blessing flow, That sense, or taste, or virtue can bestow! And oh, forgive the zeal your peace inspires, To teach that prudence which itself admires. OWEN OF CARRON. There is something romantic in the story of the following Poem; but the Author has his reasons for believing that there is something likewise authentic. On the simple circumstances of the ancient narrative, from which he first borrowed his idea, those reasons are principally founded, and they are supported by others, with which, in a work of this kind, to trouble his readers would be superfluous. THIS POEM IS INSCRIBED TO A LADY, WHOSE ELEGANT TASTE, WHOSE AMIABLE SENSIBILITY, AND WHOSE UNAFFECTED FRIENDSHIP, HAVE LONG CONTRIBUTED TO THE PLEASURE AND HAPPINESS OF THE AUTHOR. On Carron's side the primrose pale, Why does it wear a purple hue? Ye maidens fair of Marlivale, Why stream your eyes with pity's dew! 'Tis all with gentle Owen's blood That purple grows the primrose pale; That pity pours the tender flood From each fair eye in Marlivale. The evening star sate in his eye, The sun his golden tresses gave, The north's pure morn her orient dye, To him who rests in yonder grave! Beneath no high, historic stone, Tho' nobly born, is Owen laid, Stretch'd on the green wood's lap alone, He sleeps beneath the waving shade. There many a flowery race hath sprung, And fled before the mountain gale, Since first his simple dirge ye sung; Ye maidens fair of Marlivale! Yet still, when May with fragrant feet Hath wander'd o'er your meads of gold, That dirge I hear so simply sweet Far echoed from each evening fold. II. 'Twas in the pride of William's William the Lyon, king of Scotland. day, When Scotland's honours flourish'd still, The Moray's earl, with mighty sway, Bore rule o'er many a Highland hill. And far for him their fruitful store The fairer plains of Carron spread; In fortune rich, in offspring poor, An only daughter crown'd his bed. Oh! write not poor—the wealth that flows In waves of gold round India's throne, All in her shining breast that glows, To Ellen's The Lady Ellen, only daughter of John earl of Moray, betrothed to the earl of Nithisdale, and afterwards to the earl Barnard, was esteemed one of the finest women in Europe, insomuch that she had several suitors and admirers from foreign courts. charms, were earth and stone. For her the youth of Scotland sigh'd, The Frenchman gay, the Spaniard grave, And smoother Italy apply'd, And many an English baron brave. In vain by foreign arts assail'd, No foreign loves her breast beguile, And England's honest valour fail'd, Paid with a cold, but courteous smile. “Ah! woe to thee, young Nithisdale, “That o'er thy cheek those roses stray'd, “Thy breath, the violet of the vale, “Thy voice, the music of the shade! “Ah! woe to thee, that Ellen's love “Alone to thy soft tale would yield! “For soon those gentle arms shall prove “The conflict of a ruder field.” 'Twas thus a wayward sister spoke, And cast a rueful glance behind, As from her dimwood glen she broke, And mounted on the moaning wind. She spoke and vanish'd—more unmov'd Than Moray's rocks, when storms invest, The valiant youth by Ellen lov'd With aught that fear, or fate suggest. For love, methinks, hath power to raise The soul beyond a vulgar state; Th' unconquer'd banners he displays Controul our fears, and fix our fate. III. 'Twas when, on summer's softest eve, Of clouds that wander'd west away, Twilight with gentle hand did weave Her fairy robe of night and day. When all the mountain gales were still, And the wave slept against the shore, And the sun, sunk beneath the hill, Left his last smile on Lemmermore. A chain of mountains running through Scotland from east to west. Led by those waking dreams of thought That warm the young unpractis'd breast, Her wonted bower sweet Ellen sought, And Carron murmur'd near, and sooth'd her into rest. There is some kind and courtly sprite That o'er the realm of Fancy reigns, Throws sunshine on the mask of night, And smiles at Slumber's powerless chains; 'Tis told, and I believe the tale, At this soft hour that sprite was there, And spread with fairer flowers the vale, And fill'd with sweeter sounds the air. A bower he fram'd (for he could frame What long might weary mortal wight: Swift as the lightning's rapid flame Darts on the unsuspecting sight). Such bower he fram'd with magic hand, As well that wizard bard hath wove, In scenes where fair Armida's wand Wav'd all the witcheries of love. Yet it was wrought in simple shew; Nor Indian mines nor orient shores Had lent their glories here to glow, Or yielded here their shining stores. All round a poplar's trembling arms The wild-rose wound her damask flower; The woodbine lent her spicy charms, That loves to weave the lover's bower. The ash, that courts the mountain-air, In all her painted blooms array'd, The wilding's blossom blushing fair, Combin'd to form the flowery shade. With thyme that loves the brown hill's breast, The cowslip's sweet, reclining head, The violet of sky-woven vest, Was all the fairy ground bespread. But, who is he, whose locks so fair Adown his manly shoulders flow? Beside him lies the hunter's spear, Beside him sleeps the warrior's bow. He bends to Ellen—(gentle sprite, Thy sweet seductive arts forbear) He courts her arms with fond delight, And instant vanishes in air. V. Hast thou not found at early dawn Some soft ideas melt away, If o'er sweet vale, or flowery lawn, The sprite of dreams hath bid thee stray? Hast thou not some fair object seen, And, when the fleeting form was past, Still on thy memory found its mien, And felt the fond idea last? Thou hast—and oft the pictur'd view, Seen in some vision counted vain, Hast struck thy wondering eye anew, And brought the long-lost dream again. With warrior-bow, with hunter's spear, With locks adown his shoulder spread, Young Nithisdale is ranging near— He's ranging near yon mountain's head. Scarce had one pale moon pass'd away, And fill'd her silver urn again, When in the devious chase to stray, Afar from all his woodland train, To Carron's banks his fate consign'd, And, all to shun the fervid hour, He sought some friendly shade to find, And found the visionary bower. VI. Led by the golden star of love, Sweet Ellen took her wonted way, And in the deep-defending grove Sought refuge from the fervid day— Oh!—Who is he whose ringlets fair Disorder'd o'er his green vest flow, Reclin'd in rest—whose sunny hair Half hides the fair cheek's ardent glow? 'Tis he, that sprite's illusive guest, (Ah me! that sprites can fate control!) That lives still imag'd on her breast, That lives still pictur'd in her soul. As when some gentle spirit fled From earth to breathe elysian air, And, in the train whom we call dead, Perceives its long-lov'd partner there; Soft, sudden pleasure rushes o'er, Resistless, o'er its airy frame, To find its future fate restore The object of its former flame. So Ellen stood—less power to move Had he, who, bound in slumber's chain, Seem'd haply, o'er his hills to rove, And wind his woodland chace again. She stood, but trembled—mingled fear, And fond delight and melting love Seiz'd all her soul; she came not near, She came not near that fated grove. She strives to fly—from wizzard's wand As well might powerless captive fly— The new cropt flower falls from her hand— Ah! fall not with that flower to die! VII. Hast thou not seen some azure gleam Smile in the morning's orient eye, And skirt the reddening cloud's soft beam What time the sun was hasting nigh? Thou hast—and thou canst fancy well As any Muse that meets thine ear, The soul-set eye of Nithisdale, When wak'd, it fix'd on Ellen near. Silent they gaz'd—that silence broke; ‘Hail goddess of these groves,’ he cry'd, ‘O let me wear thy gentle yoke! ‘O let me in thy service bide! ‘For thee I'll climb the mountain steep, ‘Unwearied chase the destin'd prey, ‘For thee I'll pierce the wild-wood deep, ‘And part the sprays that vex thy way, ‘For thee’—‘O stranger, cease,’ she said, And swift away, like Daphne, flew, But Daphne's flight was not delay'd By aught that to her bosom grew. 'Twas Atalanta's golden fruit, The fond idea that confin'd Fair Ellen's steps, and bless'd his suit, Who was not far, not far behind. VIII. O Love! within those golden vales, Those genial airs where thou wast born, Where Nature, listening thy soft tales, Leans on the rosy breast of morn. Where the sweet Smiles, the Graces dwell, And tender sighs the heart remove, In silent eloquence to tell Thy tale, O soul-subduing Love! Ah! wherefore should grim Rage be nigh, And dark Distrust, with changeful face, And Jealousy's reverted eye Be near thy fair, thy favour'd place? IX. Earl Barnard was of high degree, And lord of many a lowland hind, And long for Ellen love had he, Had love, but not of gentle kind. From Moray's halls her absent hour He watch'd with all a miser's care; The wide domain, the princely dower Made Ellen more than Ellen fair. Ah wretch! to think the liberal soul May thus with fair affection part! Though Lothian's vales thy sway controul, Know, Lothian is not worth one heart. Studious he marks her absent hour, And, winding far where Carron flows, Sudden he sees the fated bower, And red rage on his dark brow glows. For who is he?—'Tis Nithisdale! And that fair form with arm reclin'd On his?—'Tis Ellen of the vale, 'Tis she (O powers of vengeance!) kind. Should he that vengeance swift pursue? No—that would all his hopes destroy; Moray would vanish from his view, And rob him of a miser's joy. Unseen to Moray's halls he hies— He calls his slaves, his ruffian band, And, ‘Haste to yonder groves,’ he cries, ‘And ambush'd lie by Carron's strand. ‘What time ye mark from bower or glen ‘A gentle lady take her way, ‘To distance due, and far from ken, ‘Allow her length of time to stray. ‘Then ransack straight that range of groves.— ‘With hunter's spear, and vest of green, ‘If chance, a rosy stripling roves,— ‘Ye well can aim your arrows keen.’ And now the ruffian slaves are nigh, And Ellen takes her homeward way: Though stay'd by many a tender sigh, She can no longer, longer stay. Pensive, against yon poplar pale The lover leans his gentle heart, Revolving many a tender tale, And wondering still how they could part. Three arrows pierc'd the desert air, Ere yet his tender dreams depart; And one struck deep his forehead fair, And one went through his gentle heart. Love's waking dream is lost in sleep— He lies beneath yon poplar pale; Ah! could we marvel ye should weep; Ye maidens fair of Marlivale! X. When all the mountain gales were still, And the wave slept against the shore, And the sun, sunk beneath the hill, Left his last smile on Lemmermore; Sweet Ellen takes her wonted way Along the fairy-featur'd vale: Brogjt o'er his wave does Carron play, And soon she'll meet her Nithisdale. She'll meet him soon—for at her sight Swift as the mountain deer he sped; The evening shades will sink in night,— Where art thou, loitering lover, fled? O! she will chide thy trifling stay, E'en now the soft reproach she frames: ‘Can lovers brook such long delay? ‘Lovers that boast of ardent flames!’ He comes not—weary with the chace, Soft slumber o'er his eyelids throws Her veil—we'll steal one dear embrace, We'll gently steal on his repose. This is the bower—we'll softly tread— He sleeps beneath yon poplar pale— Lover, if e'er thy heart has bled, Thy heart will far forego my tale! XI. Ellen is not in princely bower, She's not in Moray's splendid train; Their mistress dear, at midnight hour, Her weeping maidens seek in vain. Her pillow swells not deep with down; For her no balms their sweets exhale: Her limbs are on the pale turf thrown, Press'd by her lovely cheek as pale. On that fair cheek, that flowing hair, The broom its yellow leaf hath shed, And the chill mountain's early air Blows wildly o'er her beauteous head. As the soft star of orient day, When clouds involve his rosy light, Darts thro' the gloom a transient ray, And leaves the world once more to night; Returning life illumes her eye, And slow its languid orb unfolds— What are those bloody arrows nigh? Sure, bloody arrows she beholds! What was that form so ghastly pale, That low beneath the poplar lay?— ‘'Twas some poor youth—Ah Nithisdale!’ She said, and silent sunk away. XII. The morn is on the mountains spread, The wood-lark trills his liquid strain— Can morn's sweet music rouse the dead? Give the set eye its soul again? A shepherd of that gentler mind Which Nature not profusely yields, Seeks in these lonely shades to find Some wanderer from his little fields. Aghast he stands—and simple fear O'er all his paly visage glides— ‘Ah me! what means this misery here! ‘What fate this lady fair betides?’ He bears her to his friendly home, When life, he finds, has but retir'd;— With haste he frames the lover's tomb, For his is quite, is quite expir'd! XIII. ‘O hide me in thy humble bower,’ Returning late to life she said; ‘I'll bind thy crook with many a flower; ‘With many a rosy wreath thy head. ‘Good shepherd, haste to yonder grove, ‘And, if my love asleep is laid, ‘Oh! wake him not; but softly move ‘Some pillow to that gentle head. ‘Sure, thou wilt know him, shepherd swain, ‘Thou know'st the sun rise o'er the sea— ‘But oh! no lamb in all thy train ‘Was e'er so mild, so mild as he.’ ‘His head is on the wood-moss laid; ‘I did not wake his slumber deep— ‘Sweet sings the redbreast o'er the shade— ‘Why, gentle lady, would you weep?’ As flowers that fade in burning day, At evening find the dew-drop dear, But fiercer feel the noon-tide ray, When soften'd by the nightly tear; Returning in the flowing tear, This lovely flower, more sweet than they, Found her fair soul, and wandering near, The stranger, Reason, cross'd her way. Found her fair soul—Ah! so to find Was but more dreadful grief to know! Ah! sure, the privilege of mind Can not be worth the wish of woe. XIV. On melancholy's silent urn A softer shade of sorrow falls, But Ellen can no more return, No more return to Moray's halls. Beneath the low and lonely shade The slow-consuming hour she'll weep, Till Nature seeks her last-left aid, In the sad, sombrous arms of sleep. ‘These jewels, all unmeet for me, ‘Shalt thou,’ she said, ‘good shepherd, take; ‘These gems will purchase gold for thee, ‘And these be thine for Ellen's sake. ‘So fail thou not, at eve and morn, ‘The rosemary's pale bough to bring— ‘Thou know'st where I was found forlorn— ‘Where thou hast heard the redbreast sing. ‘Heedful I'll tend thy flocks the while, ‘Or aid thy shepherdess's care, ‘For I will share her humble toil, ‘And I her friendly roof will share.’ XV. And now two longsome years are past In luxury of lonely pain— The lovely mourner, found at last, To Moray's halls is borne again. Yet has she left one object dear, That wears love's sunny eye of joy— Is Nithisdale reviving here? Or is it but a shepherd's boy? By Carron's side, a shepherd's boy, He binds his vale-flowers with the reed; He wears love's sunny eye of joy, And birth he little seems to heed. XVI. But ah! no more his infant sleep Closes beneath a mother's smile, Who, only when it clos'd, would weep, And yield to tender woe the while. No more, with fond attention dear, She seeks th' unspoken wish to find; No more shall she, with pleasure's tear, See the soul waxing into mind. XVII. Does Nature bear a tyrant's breast? Is she the friend of stern controul? Wears she the despot's purple vest? Or fetters she the free-born soul? Where, worst of tyrants, is thy claim In chains thy children's breasts to bind? Gav'st thou the Promethéan flame? The incommunicable mind? Thy offspring are great Nature's,—free, And of her fair dominion heirs; Each privilege she gives to thee; Know, that each privilege is theirs. They have thy feature, wear thine eye, Perhaps some feelings of thy heart; And wilt thou their lov'd hearts deny To act their fair, their proper part? XVIII. The lord of Lothian's fertile vale, Ill-fated Ellen, claims thy hand; Thou know'st not that thy Nithisdale Was low laid by his ruffian-band. And Moray, with unfather'd eyes, Fix'd on fair Lothian's fertile dale, Attends his human sacrifice, Without the Grecian painter's veil. O married Love! thy bard shall own, Where two congenial souls unite, Thy golden chain inlaid with down, Thy lamp with Heaven's own splendor bright. But if no radiant star of love, O Hymen! smile on thy fair rite, Thy chain a wretched weight shall prove, Thy lamp a sad sepulchral light. XIX. And now has Time's slow wandering wing Borne many a year unmark'd with speed— Where is the boy by Carron's spring, Who bound his vale-flowers with the reed? Ah me! those flowers he binds no more; No early charm returns again; The parent, Nature keeps in store Her best joys for her little train. No longer heed the sun-beam bright That plays on Carron's breast he can, Reason has lent her quivering light, And shewn the chequer'd field of man. XX. As the first human heir of earth With pensive eye himself survey'd, And, all unconscious of his birth, Sate thoughtful oft in Eden's shade; In pensive thought so Owen stray'd Wild Carron's lonely woods among, And once, within their greenest glade, He fondly fram'd this simple song: XXI. Why is this crook adorn'd with gold? Why am I tales of ladies told? Why does no labour me employ, If I am but a shepherd's boy? A silken vest like mine so green In shepherd's hut I have not seen— Why should I in such vesture joy, If I am but a shepherd's boy? I know it is no shepherd's art His written meaning to impart— They teach me, sure, an idle toy, If I am but a shepherd's boy. This bracelet bright that binds my arm— It could not come from shepherd's farm; It only would that arm annoy, If I were but a shepherd's boy. And, O thou silent picture fair, That lov'st to smile upon me there, O say, and fill my heart with joy, That I am not a shepherd's boy. XXII. Ah lovely youth! thy tender lay May not thy gentle life prolong: See'st thou yon nightingale a prey? The fierce hawk hovering o'er his song? His little heart is large with love: He sweetly hails his evening star, And fate's more pointed arrows move, Insidious, from his eye afar. XXIII. The shepherdess, whose kindly care Had watch'd o'er Owen's infant breath, Must now their silent mansions share, Whom time leads calmly down to death. ‘O tell me, parent if thou art, ‘What is this lovely picture dear? ‘Why wounds its mournful eye my heart, ‘Why flows from mine th' unbidden tear? ‘Ah! youth! to leave thee loth am I, ‘Tho' I be not thy parent dear; ‘And would'st thou wish, or ere I die, ‘The story of thy birth to hear? ‘But it will make thee much bewail, ‘And it will make thy fair eye swell— She said, and told the woesome tale, As sooth as shepherdess might tell. XXIV. The heart, that sorrow doom'd to share, Has worn the frequent seal of woe, Its sad impressions learns to bear, And finds full oft, its ruin slow. But when that seal is first imprest, When the young heart its pain shall try, From the soft, yielding, trembling breast, Oft seems the startled soul to fly. Yet fled not Owen's—wild amaze In paleness cloath'd, and lifted hands, And horror's dread, unmeaning gaze, Mark the poor statue, as it stands. The simple guardian of his life Look'd wistful for the tear to glide; But, when she saw his tearless strife, Silent, she lent him one,—and died. XXV. ‘No, I am not a shepherd's boy,’ Awaking from his dream, he said, ‘Ah where is now the promis'd joy ‘Of this?—for ever, ever fled! ‘O picture dear!—for her lov'd sake ‘How fondly could my heart bewail! ‘My friendly shepherdess, O wake, ‘And tell me more of this sad tale. ‘O tell me more of this sad tale— ‘No; thou enjoy thy gentle sleep! ‘And I will go to Lothian's vale, ‘And more than all her waters weep.’ XXVI. Owen to Lothian's vale is fled— Earl Barnard's lofty towers appear— ‘O! art thou there,’ the full heart said, ‘O! art thou there, my parent dear?’ Yes, she is there: from idle state Oft has she stole her hour to weep; Think how she ‘by thy cradle sate,’ And how she ‘fondly saw thee sleep.’ See the ancient Scottish ballad, called Gill Morrice. Now tries his trembling hand to frame Full many a tender line of love; And still he blots the parent's name, For that, he fears, might fatal prove. XXVII. O'er a fair fountain's smiling side Reclin'd a dim tower, clad with moss, Where every bird was wont to bide, That languish'd for its partner's loss. This scene he chose, this scene assign'd A parent's first embrace to wait, And many a soft fear fill'd his mind, Anxious for his fond letter's fate. The hand that bore those lines of love, The well-informing bracelet bore— Ah! may they not unprosperous prove! Ah! safely pass yon dangerous door! XXVIII. ‘She comes not;—can she then delay?’ Cried the fair youth, and dropt a tear— ‘Whatever filial love could say, ‘To her I said, and call'd her dear. ‘She comes—Oh! no—encircled round ‘'Tis some rude chief with many a spear. ‘My hapless tale that earl has found— ‘Ah me! my heart!—for her I fear.’ His tender tale that earl had read, Or ere it reach'd his lady's eye, His dark brow wears a cloud of red, In rage he deems a rival nigh. XXIX. 'Tis o'er—those locks that wav'd in gold, That wav'd adown those cheeks so fair, Wreath'd in the gloomy tyrant's hold, Hang from the sever'd head in air; That streaming head he joys to bear In horrid guise to Lothian's halls; Bids his grim ruffians place it there, Erect upon the frowning walls. The fatal tokens forth he drew— ‘Know'st thou these—Ellen of the vale?’ The pictur'd bracelet soon she knew, And soon her lovely cheek grew pale.— The trembling victim straight he led, Ere yet her soul's first fear was o'er: He pointed to the ghastly head— She saw—and sunk, to rise no more.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. Et vos, O Lauri, carpam; et te, proxima Myrte! Sic positæ quoniam suaves miscetis odores. VIRG. THE FABLES OF FLORA. ?Sylvas, saltusque sequamur Intactos? Virg. FABLE I. THE SUNFLOWER AND THE IVY. As duteous to the place of prayer, Within the convent's lonely walls, The holy sisters still repair, What time the rosy morning calls: So fair, each morn, so full of grace, Within their little garden rear'd, The flower of Phœbus turn'd her face To meet the power she lov'd and fear'd. And where, along the rising sky, Her god in brighter glory burn'd, Still there her fond observant eye, And there her golden breast she turn'd. When calling from their weary height On western waves his beams to rest, Still there she sought the parting sight, And there she turn'd her golden breast. But soon as night's invidious shade Afar his lovely looks had borne, With folded leaves and drooping head, Full sore she griev'd, as one forlorn. Such duty in a flower display'd The holy sisters smil'd to see, Forgave the pagan rites it paid, And lov'd its fond idolatry. But painful still, though meant for kind, The praise that falls on Envy's ear! O'er the dim window's arch entwin'd, The canker'd Ivy chanc'd to hear. And “See,” she cried, “that specious flower, “Whose flattering bosom courts the sun, “The pageant of a gilded hour, “The convent's simple hearts hath won! “Obsequious meanness! ever prone “To watch the patron's turning eye; “No will, no motion of its own! “'Tis this they love, for this they sigh: “Go, splendid sycophant! no more “Display thy soft seductive arts! “The flattering clime of courts explore, “Nor spoil the convent's simple hearts. “To me their praise more justly due, “Of longer bloom, and happier grace! “Whom changing months unalter'd view, “And find them in my fond embrace.” “How well,” the modest flower replied, “Can Envy's wrested eye elude “The obvious bounds that still divide “Foul Flattery from fair Gratitude. “My duteous praise each hour I pay, “For few the hours that I must live; “And give to him my little day, “Whose grace another day may give. “When low this golden form shall fall “And spread with dust its parent plain; “That dust shall hear his genial call, “And rise, to glory rise again. “To thee, my gracious power, to thee “My love, my heart, my life are due! “Thy goodness gave that life to be; “Thy goodness shall that life renew. “Ah me! one moment from thy sight “That thus my truant-eye should stray! “The god of glory sets in night! “His faithless flower has lost a day.” Sore griev'd the flower, and droop'd her head; And sudden tears her breast bedew'd: Consenting tears the sisters shed, And, wrapt in holy wonder, view'd. With joy, with pious pride elate, “Behold,” the aged abbess cries, “An emblem of that happier fate “Which heaven to all but us denies. “Our hearts no fears but duteous fears, “No charm but duty's charm can move; “We shed no tears but holy tears “Of tender penitence and love. “See there the envious world pourtray'd “In that dark look, that creeping pace! “No flower can bear the Ivy's shade; “No tree support its cold embrace. “The oak that rears it from the ground, “And bears its tendrils to the skies, “Feels at his heart the rankling wound, “And in its poisonous arms he dies.” Her moral thus the matron read, Studious to teach her children dear, And they by love, or duty led, With pleasure heard, or seem'd to hear. Yet one less duteous, not less fair, (In convents still the tale is known) The fable heard with silent care, But found a moral of her own. The flower that smil'd along the day, And droop'd in tears at evening's fall; Too well she found her life display, Too well her fatal lot recall. The treacherous Ivy's gloomy shade, That murder'd what it most embrac'd, Too well that cruel scene convey'd Which all her fairer hopes effac'd. Her heart with silent horror shook; With sighs she sought her lonely cell: To the dim light she cast one look; And bade once more the world farewell. FABLE II. THE EVENING PRIMROSE. There are that love the shades of life, And shun the splendid walks of fame; There are that hold it rueful strife To risk Ambition's losing game; That far from Envy's lurid eye The fairest fruits of Genius rear, Content to see them bloom and die In Friendship's small but kindly sphere. Than vainer flowers tho' sweeter far, The Evening Primrose shuns the day; Blooms only to the western star, And loves its solitary ray. In Eden's vale an aged hind, At the dim twilight's closing hour, On his time-smoothed staff reclin'd, With wonder view'd the opening flower. “Ill-fated flower, at eve to blow,” In pity's simple thought he cries, “Thy bosom must not feel the glow “Of splendid suns, or smiling skies. “Nor thee, the vagrants of the field, “The hamlet's little train behold; “Their eyes to sweet oppression yield, “When thine the falling shades unfold. “Nor thee the hasty shepherd heeds, “When love has fill'd his heart with cares, “For flowers he rifles all the meads, “For waking flowers—but thine forbears. “Ah! waste no more that beauteous bloom “On night's chill shade, that fragrant breath, “Let smiling suns those gems illume! “Fair flower, to live unseen is death.” Soft as the voice of vernal gales That o'er the bending meadow blow, Or streams that steal thro' even vales, And murmur that they move so slow: Deep in her unfrequented bower, Sweet Philomela pour'd her strain; The bird of eve approv'd her flower, And answer'd thus the anxious swain. Live unseen! By moonlight shades, in valleys green, Lovely flower, we'll live unseen. Of our pleasures deem not lightly, Laughing day may look more sprightly, But I love the modest mien, Still I love the modest mien Of gentle evening fair, and her star-train'd queen. Didst thou, shepherd, never find, Pleasure is of pensive kind? Has thy cottage never known That she loves to live alone? Dost thou not at evening hour Feel some soft and secret power, Gliding o'er thy yielding mind, Leave sweet serenity behind; While all disarm'd, the cares of day Steal thro' the falling gloom away? Love to think thy lot was laid In this undistinguish'd shade. Far from the world's infectious view, Thy little virtues safely blew. Go, and in day's more dangerous hour, Guard thy emblematic flower. FABLE III. THE LAUREL AND THE REED. The The reeds on the banks of the Cephisus, of which the shepherds made their pipes, Sylla's soldiers used for arrows. reed that once the shepherd blew On old Cephisus' hallow'd side, To Sylla's cruel bow apply'd, Its inoffensive master slew. Stay, bloody soldier, stay thy hand, Nor take the shepherd's gentle breath: Thy rage let innocence withstand; Let music soothe the thirst of death. He frown'd—He bade the arrow fly— The arrow smote the tuneful swain; No more its tone his lip shall try, Nor wake its vocal soul again. Cephisus, from his sedgy urn, With woe beheld the sanguine deed; He mourn'd, and, as they heard him mourn, Assenting sigh'd each trembling reed. “Fair offspring of my waves,” he cried; “That bind my brows, my banks adorn, “Pride of the plains, the rivers' pride, “For music, peace, and beauty born! “Ah! what, unheedful have we done? “What dæmons here in death delight? “What fiends that curse the social sun? “What furies of infernal night? “See, see my peaceful shepherds bleed! “Each heart in harmony that vy'd, “Smote by its own melodious reed, “Lies cold, along my blushing side. “Back to your urn, my waters, fly; “Or find in earth some secret way; “For horror dims yon conscious sky, “And hell has issu'd into day.” Thro' Delphi's holy depth of shade The sympathetic sorrows ran; While in his dim and mournful glade The Genius of her groves began: “In vain Cephisus sighs to save “The swain that loves his watry mead, “And weeps to see his reddening wave, “And mourns for his perverted reed: “In vain my violated groves “Must I with equal grief bewail, “While desolation sternly roves, “And bids the sanguine hand assail. “God of the genial stream, behold “My laurel shades of leaves so bare! “Those leaves no poet's brows enfold, “Nor bind Apollo's golden hair. “Like thy fair offspring, misapply'd, “Far other purpose they supply; “The murderer's burning cheek to hide, “And on his frownful temples die. “Yet deem not these of Pluto's race, “Whom wounded Nature sues in vain; “Pluto disclaims the dire disgrace, “And cries, indignant, They are men.” FABLE IV. THE GARDEN ROSE AND THE WILD ROSE. As Dee, whose current, free from stain, Glides fair o'er Merioneth's plain, By mountains forc'd his way to steer Along the lake of Pimble Mere, Darts swiftly thro' the stagnant mass, His waters trembling as they pass, And leads his lucid waves below, Unmix'd, unsullied as they flow— So clear thro' life's tumultuous tide, So free could Thought and Fancy glide; Could Hope as sprightly hold her course, As first she left her native source, Unsought in her romantic cell The keeper of her dreams might dwell. But ah! they will not, will not last— When life's first fairy stage is past, The glowing hand of Hope is cold; And Fancy lives not to be old. Darker, and darker all before; We turn the former prospect o'er; And find in Memory's faithful eye Our little stock of pleasures lie. Come, then; thy kind recesses ope! Fair keeper of the dreams of Hope! Come with thy visionary train; And bring my morning scenes again! To Enon's wild and silent shade, Where oft my lonely youth was laid; What time the woodland Genius came. And touch'd me with his holy flame.— Or, where the hermit, Bela, leads Her waves thro' solitary meads; And only feeds the desart-flower, Where once she sooth'd my slumbering hour: Or rous'd by Stainmore's wintry sky, She wearies echo with her cry; And oft, what storms her bosom tear, Her deeply-wounded banks declare.— Where Eden's fairer waters flow, By Milton's bower, or Osty's brow, Or Brockley's alder-shaded cave, Or, winding round the Druid's grave, Silently glide, with pious fear To sound his holy slumbers near.— To these fair scenes of Fancy's reign, O Memory! bear me once again: For, when life's varied scenes are past, 'Tis simple Nature charms at last. 'Twas thus of old a poet pray'd; Th' indulgent power his pray'r approv'd, And, ere the gather'd rose could fade, Restor'd him to the scenes he lov'd. A Rose, the poet's favourite flower, From Flora's cultur'd walks he bore; No fairer bloom'd in Esher's bower, Nor Prior's charming Chloe wore. No fairer flowers could Fancy twine To hide Anacreon's snowy hair; For there Almeria's bloom divine, And Elliot's sweetest blush was there. When she, the pride of courts, retires, And leaves for shades, a nation's love, With awe the village maid admires, How Waldegrave looks, how Waldegrave moves. So marvell'd much in Enon's shade The flowers that all uncultur'd grew, When there the splendid Rose display'd Her swelling breast, and shining hue. Yet one, that oft adorn'd the place Where now her gaudy rival reign'd, Of simpler bloom, but kindred race, The pensive Eglantine complain'd.— “Mistaken youth,” with sighs she said, “From Nature and from me to stray! “The bard, by splendid forms betray'd, “No more shall frame the purer lay. “Luxuriant, like the flaunting Rose, “And gay the brilliant strains may be, “But far, in beauty, far from those, “That flow'd to Nature and to me.” The poet felt, with fond surprise, The truths the sylvan critic told; And, “Though this courtly Rose,” he cries, “Is gay, is beauteous to behold; “Yet, lovely flower, I find in thee “Wild sweetness which no words express, “And charms in thy simplicity, “That dwell not in the pride of dress.” FABLE V. THE VIOLET AND THE PANSY. Shepherd, if near thy artless breast The god of fond desires repair; Implore him for a gentle guest, Implore him with unwearied prayer. Should beauty's soul-enchanting smile, Love-kindling looks, and features gay, Should these thy wandering eye beguile, And steal thy wareless heart away; That heart shall soon with sorrow swell, And soon the erring eye deplore, If in the beauteous bosom dwell No gentle virtue's genial store. Far from his hive one summer-day, A young and yet unpractis'd bee, Borne on his tender wings away, Went forth the flowery world to see. The morn, the noon in play he pass'd, But when the shades of evening came, No parent brought the due repast, And faintness seiz'd his little frame. By nature urg'd, by instinct led, The bosom of a flower he sought, Where streams mourn'd round a mossy bed, And violets all the bank enwrought. Of kindred race, but brighter dies, On that fair bank a Pansy grew, That borrow'd from indulgent skies A velvet shade and purple hue. The tints that stream'd with glossy gold, The velvet shade, the purple hue, The stranger wonder'd to behold, And to its beauteous bosom flew. Not fonder haste the lover speeds, At evening's fall, his fair to meet, When o'er the hardly-bending meads He springs on more than mortal feet. Nor glows his eyes with brighter glee, When stealing near her orient breast, Than felt the fond enamour'd bee, When first the golden bloom he prest. Ah! pity much his youth untry'd, His heart in beauty's magic spell! So never passion thee betide, But where the genial virtues dwell. In vain he seeks those virtues there; No soul-sustaining charms abound: No boney'd sweetness to repair The languid waste of life is found. An aged bee, whose labours led Thro' those fair springs, and meads of gold, His feeble wing, his drooping head Beheld, and pitied to behold. “Fly, fond adventurer, fly the art “That courts thine eye with fair attire; “Who smiles to win the heedless heart, “Will smile to see that heart expire. “This modest flower of humbler hue, “That boasts no depth of glowing dyes, “Array'd in unbespangled blue, “The simple clothing of the skies— “This flower, with balmy sweetness blest, “May yet thy languid life renew:” He said, and to the Violet's breast The little vagrant faintly flew. FABLE VI. THE QUEEN OF THE MEADOW AND THE CROWN IMPERIAL. From Bactria's vales, where beauty blows Luxuriant in the genial ray; Where flowers a bolder gem disclose, And deeper drink the golden day. From Bactria's vales to Britain's shore What time the Crown Imperial came, Full high the stately stranger bore The honours of his birth and name. In all the pomp of eastern state, In all the eastern glory gay, He bade, with native pride elate, Each flower of humbler birth obey. O, that the child unborn might hear, Nor hold it strange in distant time, That freedom e'en to flowers was dear, To flowers that bloom'd in Britain's clime! Thro' purple meads, and spicy gales, Where Strymon's The Ionian Strymon. silver waters play, While far from hence their goddess dwells, She rules with delegated sway. That sway the Crown Imperial sought, With high demand and haughty mien: But equal claim a rival brought, A rival call'd the Meadow's Queen. “In climes of orient glory born, “Where beauty first and empire grew; “Where first unfolds the golden morn, “Where richer falls the fragrant dew: “In light's ethereal beauty drest, “Behold,” he cried, “the favour'd flower, “Which Flora's high commands invest “With ensigns of imperial power! “Where prostrate vales, and blushing meads, “And bending mountains own his sway, “While Persia's lord his empire leads, “And bids the trembling world obey; “While blood bedews the straining bow, “And conquest rends the scatter'd air, “'Tis mine to bind the victor's brow, “And reign in envy'd glory there. “Then lowly bow, ye British flowers! “Confess your monarch's mighty sway, “And own the only glory yours, “When fear flies trembling to obey.” He said, and sudden o'er the plain, From flower to flower a murmur ran, With modest air, and milder strain, When thus the Meadow's Queen began: “If vain of birth, of glory vain, “Or fond to bear a regal name, “The pride of folly brings disdain, “And bids me urge a tyrant's claim: “If war my peaceful realms assail, “And then, unmov'd by pity's call, “I smile to see the bleeding vale, “Or feel one joy in Nature's fall, “Then may each justly vengeful flower “Pursue ber Queen with gen'rous strife, “Nor leave the hand of lawless power “Such compass on the scale of life. “One simple virtue all my pride! “The wish that flies to mis'ry's aid; “The balm that stops the crimson tide, The property of that flower. “And heals the wounds that war has made.” Their free consent by zephyrs borne, The flowers their Meadow's Queen obey; And fairer blushes crown'd the morn, And sweeter fragrance fill'd the day. FABLE VII. THE WALL-FLOWER. “Why loves my flower, the sweetest flower “That swells the golden breast of May, “Thrown rudely o'er this ruin'd tower, “To waste her solitary day? “Why, when the mead, the spicy vale, “The grove and genial garden call, “Will she her fragrant soul exhale, “Unheeded on the lonely wall? “For never sure was beauty born “To live in death's deserted shade! “Come, lively flower, my banks adorn, “My banks for life and beauty made.” Thus Pity wak'd the tender thought, And by her sweet persuasion led, To seize the hermit-flower I sought, And bear her from her stony bed. I sought—but sudden on mine ear A voice in hollow murmurs broke, And smote my heart with holy fear— The Genius of the Ruin spoke. “From thee be far th' ungentle deed, “The honours of the dead to spoil, “Or take the sole remaining meed, “The flower that crowns their former toil! “Nor deem that flower the garden's foe, “Or fond to grace this barren shade; “'Tis Nature tells her to bestow “Her honours on the lonely dead. “For this, obedient zephyrs bear “Her light seeds round yon turret's mold, “And undispers'd by tempests there, “They rise in vegetable gold. “Nor shall thy wonder wake to see “Such desart scenes distinction crave; “Oft have they been, and oft shall be “Truth's, Honour's, Valour's, Beauty's grave. “Where longs to fall that rifted spire, “As weary of th' insulting air; “The poet's thought, the warrior's fire, “The lover's sighs are sleeping there. “When that too shakes the trembling ground, “Borne down by some tempestuous sky, “And many a slumbering cottage round “Startles—how still their hearts will lie! “Of them who, wrapt in earth so cold, “No more the smiling day shall view, “Should many a tender tale be told; “For many a tender thought is due. “Hast thou not seen some lover pale, “When evening brought the pensive hour, “Step slowly o'er the shadowy vale, “And stop to pluck the frequent flower? “Those flowers he surely meant to strew “On lost affection's lowly cell; “Tho' there, as fond remembrance grew, “Forgotten, from his hand they fell. “Has not for thee the fragrant thorn “Been taught her first rose to resign? “With vain but pious fondness borne “To deck thy Nancy's honour'd shrine! “'Tis Nature pleading in the breast, “Fair memory of her works to find; “And when to fate she yields the rest, “She claims the monumental mind. “Why, else, the o'ergrown paths of time “Would thus the letter'd sage explore, “With pain these crumbling ruins climb, “And on the doubtful sculpture pore? “Why seeks he with unwearied toil “Thro' death's dim walks to urge his way, “Reclaim his long-asserted spoil, “And lead Oblivion into day? “'Tis Nature prompts, by toil or fear “Unmov'd, to range thro' death's domain: “The tender parent loves to hear “Her children's story told again. “Treat not with scorn his thoughtful hours, “If haply near these haunts he stray; “Nor take the fair enlivening flowers “That bloom to cheer his lonely way.” FABLE VIII. THE TULIP AND THE MYRTLE. 'Twas on the border of a stream A gaily-painted Tulip stood, And, gilded by the morning beam, Survey'd her beauties in the flood. And sure, more lovely to behold, Might nothing meet the wistful eye, Than crimson fading into gold, In streaks of fairest symmetry. The beauteous flower, with pride elate, Ah me! that pride with beauty dwells! Vainly affects superior state, And thus in empty fancy swells: “O lustre of unrivall'd bloom! “Fair painting of a hand divine! “Superior far to mortal doom, “The hues of heav'n alone are mine! “Away, ye worthless, formless race! “Ye weeds, that boast the name of flowers? “No more my native bed disgrace, “Unmeet for tribes so mean as yours! “Shall the bright daughter of the sun “Associate with the shrubs of earth? “Ye slaves, your sovereign's presence shun! “Respect her beauties and her birth. “And thou, dull, sullen ever-green! “Shalt thou my shining sphere invade? “My noon-day beauties beam unseen, “Obscur'd beneath thy dusky shade!” “Deluded flower!” the Myrtle cries, “Shall we thy moment's bloom adore? “The meanest shrub that you despise, “The meanest flower has merit more. “That daisy, in its simple bloom, “Shall last along the changing year; “Blush on the snow of winter's gloom, “And bid the smiling spring appear. “The violet, that, those banks beneath, “Hides from thy scorn its modest head, “Shall fill the air with fragrant breath, “When thou art in thy dusty bed. “E'en I, who boast no golden shade, “Am of no shining tints possess'd, “When low thy lucid form is laid, “Shall bloom on many a lovely breast. “And he, whose kind and fost'ring care “To thee, to me, our beings gave, “Shall near his breast my flowrets wear, “And walk regardless o'er thy grave. “Deluded flower, the friendly screen “That hides thee from the noon-tide ray, “And mocks thy passion to be seen, “Prolongs thy transitory day. “But kindly deeds with scorn repaid, “No more by virtue need be done: “I now withdraw my dusky shade, “And yield thee to thy darling sun.” Fierce on the flower the scorching beam With all its weight of glory fell; The flower exulting caught the gleam, And lent its leaves a bolder swell. Expanded by the searching fire, The curling leaves the breast disclos'd; The mantling bloom was painted higher, And every latent charm expos'd. But when the sun was sliding low And ev'ning came, with dews so cold; The wanton beauty ceas'd to blow, And sought her bending leaves to fold. Those leaves, alas! no more would close; Relax'd, exhausted, sick'ning, pale; They left her to a parent's woes, And fled before the rising gale. FABLE IX. THE BEE-FLOWER. This is a species of the orchis, which is found in the barren and mountainous parts of Lincolnshire, Worcestershire, Kent, and Herefordshire. Nature has formed a bee apparently feeding on the breast of a flower with so much exactness, that it is impossible at a very small distance to distinguish the imposition. For this purpose she has observed an economy different from what is found in most other flowers, and has laid the petals horizontally. The genius of the orchis, or satyrion, she seems professedly to have made use of for her paintings, and on the different species has drawn the perfect forms of different insects, such as bees, flies, butterflies, &amp;c. Come, let us leave this painted plain; This waste of flowers that palls the eye: The walks of Nature's wilder reign Shall please in plainer majesty. Thro' those fair scenes, where yet she owes Superior charms to Brockman's art, Where, crown'd with elegant repose, He cherishes the social heart— Thro' those fair scenes we'll wander wild, And on yon pastur'd mountains rest; Come, brother dear! come, Nature's child! With all her simple virtues blest. The sun far-seen on distant towers, And clouding groves and peopled seas, And ruins pale of princely bowers On Beachb'rough's airy heights shall please. Nor lifeless there the lonely scene; The little labourer of the hive, From flower to flower, from green to green, Murmurs, and makes the wild alive. See, on that flowret's velvet breast How close the busy vagrant lies! His thin-wrought plume, his downy breast, Th' ambrosial gold that swells his thighs! Regardless, whilst we wander near, Thrifty of time, his task he plies; Or sees he no intruder near? And rest in sleep his weary eyes? Perhaps his fragrant load may bind His limbs;—we'll set the captive free— I sought the living Bee to find, And found the picture of a Bee. Attentive to our trifling selves, From thence we plan the rule of all; Thus Nature with the fabled elves We rank, and these her sports we call. Be far, my friends, from you, from me, Th' unhallow'd term, the thought profane, That Life's majestic source may be In idle fancy's trifling vein. Remember still, 'tis Nature's plan Religion in your love to find; And know, for this, she first in man Inspir'd the imitative mind. As conscious that affection grows, Pleas'd with the pencil's mimic power; The well known fables of the Painter and the Statuary that fell in love with objects of their own creation, plainly arose from the idea of that attachment, which follows the imitation of agreeable objects, to the objects imitated. That power with leading hand she shews, And paints a Bee upon a flower. Mark, how that rooted mandrake wears His human feet, his human hands! Oft, as his shapely form he tears, Aghast the frighted ploughman stands. See where, in yonder orient stone, She seems e'en with herself at strife, While fairer from her hand is shewn The pictur'd, than the native life. Helvetia's rocks, Sabrina's waves, Still many a shining pebble bear, Where oft her studious hand engraves The perfect form, and leaves it there. O long, my Paxton, An ingenious portrait painter in Rathbone Place. boast her art; And long her laws of love fulfil: To thee she gave her hand and heart, To thee, her kindness and her skill! FABLE X. THE WILDING AND THE BROOM. In yonder green wood blows the Broom; Shepherds, we'll trust our flocks to stray. Court Nature in her sweetest bloom, And steal from care one summer-day. From him William Hamilton of Bangour. whose gay and graceful brow Fair-handed Hume with roses binds, We'll learn to breathe the tender vow, Where slow the fairy Fortha winds. And oh! that he Thomson. whose gentle breast In Nature's softest mould was made, Who left her smiling works imprest In characters that cannot fade; That he might leave his lowly shrine, Tho' softer there the seasons fall— They come, the sons of verse divine, They come to Fancy's magic call. “What airy sounds invite “My steps not unreluctant, from the depth “Of Shene's delightful groves? Reposing there “No more I hear the busy voice of men “Far-toiling o'er the globe—save to the call “Of soul-exalting poetry, the ear “Of death denies attention. Rouz'd by her, “The genius of sepulchral silence opes “His drowsy cells, and yields us to the day. “For thee, whose hand, whatever paints the spring, “Or swells on summer's breast, or loads the lap “Of autumn, gathers heedful—Thee whose rites “At Nature's shrine with holy care are paid “Daily and nightly, boughs of brightest green, “And every fairest rose, the god of groves, “The queen of flowers, shall sweeter save for thee. “Yet not if beauty only claim thy lay, “Tunefully trifling. Fair philosophy, “And Nature's love, and every moral charm “That leads in sweet captivity the mind “To virtue—ever in thy nearest cares “Be these, and animate thy living page “With truth resistless, beaming from the source “Of perfect ligh immortal—Vainly boasts “That golden Broom its sunny robe of flowers: “Fair are the sunny flowers; but, fading soon “And fruitless, yield the forester's regard “To the well-loaded Wilding—Shepherd, there “Behold the fate of song, and lightly deem “Of all but moral beauty.” “Not in vain”— I hear my Hamilton reply, (The torch of fancy in his eye) “'Tis not in vain,” I hear him say, “That Nature paints her works so gay; “For, fruitless tho' that fairy Broom, “Yet still we love her lavish bloom. “Cheer'd with that bloom, yon desart wild “Its native horrors lost, and smil'd. “And oft we mark her golden ray “Along the dark wood scatter day. “Of moral uses take the strife; “Leave me the elegance of life. “Whatever charms the ear or eye, “All beauty and all harmony; “If sweet sensations these produce, “I know they have their moral use. “I know that Nature's charms can move “The springs that strike to Virtue's love.” FABLE XI. THE MISLETOE AND THE PASSION-FLOWER. In this dim cave a druid sleeps, Where stops the passing gale to moan; The rock he hollow'd o'er him weeps, And cold drops wear the fretted stone. In this dim cave, of diff'rent creed, An hermit's holy ashes rest: The school-boy finds the frequent bead, Which many a formal matin blest. That truant-time full well I know, When here I brought, in stolen hour, The druid's magic Misletoe, The holy hermit's Passion-flower. The off'rings on the mystic stone Pensive I laid, in thought profound, When from the cave a deep'ning groan Issued, and froze me to the ground. I hear it still—Dost thou not hear? Does not thy haunted fancy start? The sound still vibrates thro' mine ear— The horror rushes on my heart. Unlike to living sounds it came, Unmix'd, unmelodiz'd with breath; But, grinding thro' some scrannel frame, Creak'd from the bony lungs of death. I hear it still—“Depart,” it cries; “No tribute bear to shades unblest: “Know, here a bloody druid lies, “Who was not nurs'd at Nature's breast. “Associate he with dæmons dire, “O'er human victims held the knife, “And pleas'd to see the babe expire, “Smil'd grimly o'er its quiv'ring life. “Behold his crimson-streaming hand “Erect!—his dark, fix'd, murd'rous eye!” In the dim cave I saw him stand; And my heart died—I felt it die. I see him still—Dost thou not see The haggard eye-ball's hollow glare? And gleams of wild ferocity Dart thro' the sable shade of hair? What meagre form behind him moves, With eye that rues th' invading day; And wrinkled aspect wan, that proves The mind to pale remorse a prey? What wretched—Hark—the voice replies, “Boy, bear these idle honours hence! “For, bere a guilty hermit lies, “Untrue to Nature, Virtue, Sense. “Tho' Nature lent him powers to aid “The moral cause, the mutual weal; “Those powers he sunk in this dim shade, “The desp'rate suicide of zeal. “Go, teach the drone of saintly haunts, “Whose cell's the sepulchre of time; “Tho' many a holy hymn he chaunts, “His life is one continu'd crime. “And bear them hence, the plant, the flower; “No symbols those of systems vain! “They have the duties of their hour; “Some bird, some insect to sustain.” THE COUNTRY JUSTICE. BY ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S JUSTICES OF THE PEACE FOR THE COUNTY OF SOMERSET. PART THE FIRST. TO RICHARD BURN, LL.D. ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S JUSTICES OF THE PEACE FOR THE COUNTIES OF WESTMORLAND AND CUMBERLAND. INTRODUCTION. In Richard's days, when lost his pastur'd plain, The wand'ring Briton sought the wild wood's reign, With great disdain beheld the feudal hord, Poor life-let vassals of a Norman Lord; And, what no brave man ever lost, possess'd Himself—for Freedom bound him to her breast. Lov'st thou that Freedom? By her holy shrine, If yet one drop of British blood be thine, See, I conjure thee, in the desart shade, His bow unstrung, his little household laid, Some brave forefather; while his fields they share, By Saxon, Dane, or Norman banish'd there! And think he tells thee, as his soul withdraws, As his heart swells against a tyrant's laws, The war with Fate, though fruitless to maintain, To guard that liberty he lov'd in vain. Were thoughts like these the dream of ancient time? Peculiar only to some age, or clime? And does not Nature thoughts like these impart, Breathe in the soul, and write upon the heart? Ask on their mountains yon deserted band, That point to Paoli with no plausive hand; Despising still, their freeborn souls unbroke, Alike the Gallic and Ligurian yoke! Yet while the patriots' gen'rous rage we share, Still civil safety calls us back to care;— To Britain lost in either Henry's day, Her woods, her mountains one wild scene of prey! Fair Peace from all her bounteous vallies fled, And Law beneath the barbed arrow bled. In happier days, with more auspicious fate, The far-fam'd Edward heal'd his wounded state; Dread of his foes, but to his subjects dear, These learn'd to love, as those are taught to fear, Their laurell'd Prince with British pride obey, His glory shone their discontent away. With care the tender flower of love to save, And plant the olive on Disorder's grave, For civil storms fresh barriers to provide, He caught the fav'ring calm and falling tide. The Appointment, and its Purposes. The social laws from insult to protect, To cherish peace, to cultivate respect; The rich from wanton cruelty restrain, To smooth the bed of penury and pain; The hapless vagrant to his rest restore, The maze of fraud, the haunts of theft explore; The thoughtless maiden, when subdu'd by art, To aid, and bring her rover to her heart; Wild riot's voice with dignity to quell, Forbid unpeaceful passions to rebel, Wrest from revenge the meditated harm, For this fair Justice rais'd her sacred arm; For this the rural magistrate, of yore, Thy honours, Edward, to his mansion bore. Ancient Justice's Hall. Oft, where old Air in conscious glory sails, On silver waves that flow thro' smiling vales, In Harewood's groves, where long my youth was laid, Unseen beneath their ancient world of shade, With many a group of antique columns crown'd, In gothic guise such mansion have I found. Nor lightly deem, ye apes of modern race, Ye cits that sore bedizen Nature's face, Of the more manly structures here ye view; They rose for greatness that ye never knew! Ye reptile cits, that oft have mov'd my spleen With Venus, and the Graces on your green! Let Plutus, growling o'er his ill-got wealth, Let Mercury, the thriving god of stealth, The shopman, Janus, with his double looks, Rise on your mounts, and perch upon your books! But, spare my Venus, spare each sister Grace, Ye cits, that sore bedizen Nature's face! Ye royal architects, whose antic taste, Would lay the realms of Sense and Nature waste; Forgot, whenever from her steps ye stray, That folly only points each other way; Here, tho' your eye no courtly creature sees, Snakes on the ground, or monkies in the trees; Yet let not too severe a censure fall, On the plain precincts of the ancient Hall. For tho' no sight your childish fancy meets, Of Thibets' dogs, or China's perroquets; Tho' apes, asps, lizzards, things without a tail, And all the tribes of foreign monsters fail; Here shall ye sigh to see, with rust o'ergrown, The iron griffin and the sphynx of stone; And mourn, neglected in their waste abodes, Fire-breathing drakes, and water-spouting gods. Long have these mighty monsters known disgrace, Yet still some trophies hold their ancient place; Where, round the Hall, the oak's high surbase rears The field-day triumphs of two hundred years. Th' enormous antlers here recal the day That saw the forest-monarch forc'd away; Who, many a flood, and many a mountain past, Nor finding those, nor deeming these the last, O'er floods, o'er mountains yet prepar'd to fly, Long ere the death-drop fill'd his failing eye! Here, fam'd for cunning, and in crimes grown old, Hangs his grey brush, the felon of the fold. Oft, as the rent feast swells the midnight cheer, The maudlin farmer kens him o'er his beer, And tells his old, traditionary tale, Tho' known to ev'ry tenant of the vale. Here, where, of old, the festal ox has fed, Mark'd with his weight, the mighty horns are spread: Some ox, O Marshall, for a board like thine, Where the vast master with the vast sirloin Vied in round magnitude—Respect I bear To thee, tho' oft the ruin of the chair. These, and such antique tokens, that record The manly spirit, and the bounteous board, Me more delight than all the gew-gaw train, The whims and zigzags of a modern brain, More than all Asia's marmosets to view Grin, frisk, and water in the walks of Kew. Character of a Country Justice. Thro' these fair vallies, stranger, hast thou stray'd, By any chance, to visit Harewood's shade, And seen with honest, antiquated air, In the plain Hall the magistratial chair? There Herbert sate—the love of human kind, Pure light of truth, and temperance of mind, In the free eye the featur'd soul display'd, Honour's strong beam, and Mercy's melting shade; Justice, that, in the rigid paths of law, Would still some drops from Pity's fountain draw, Bend o'er her urn with many a gen'rous fear, Ere his firm seal should force one orphan's tear; Fair Equity, and Reason scorning art, And all the sober virtues of the heart— These sate with Herbert, these shall best avail, Where statutes order; or where statutes fail. General Motives for Lenity. Be this, ye rural Magistrates, your plan: Firm be your justice, but be friends to Man. He whom the mighty master of this ball, We fondly deem, or farcically call, To own the Patriarch's truth however loth, Holds but a mansion crush'd before the moth. Frail in his genius, in his heart, too, frail, Born but to err, and erring to bewail; Shalt thou his faults with eye severe explore, And give to life one human weakness more? Still mark if Vice or Nature prompts the deed; Still mark the strong temptation and the need: On pressing Want, on Famine's pow'rful call, At least more lenient let thy justice fall, Apology for Vagrants. For him, who, lost to ev'ry hope of life, Has long with fortune held unequal strife, Known to no human love, no human care, The friendless, homeless object of despair; For the poor Vagrant, feel, while he complains, Nor from sad freedom send to sadder chains. Alike, if folly or misfortune brought Those last of woes his evil days have wrought; Believe with social mercy and with me, Folly's misfortune in the first degree. Perhaps on some inhospitable shore The houseless wretch a widow'd parent bore; Who, then, no more by golden prospects led, Of the poor Indian begg'd a leafy bed. Cold on Canadian hills, or Minden's plain, Perhaps that parent mourn'd her soldier slain; Bent o'er her babe, her eye dissolv'd in dew, The big drops mingling with the milk he drew, Gave the sad presage of his future years, The child of misery, baptiz'd in tears! Apostrophe to Edward the Third. O Edward, here thy fairest laurels fade! And thy long glories darken into shade While yet the palms thy hardy veterans won, The deeds of valour that for thee were done, While yet the wreaths for which they bravely bled, Fir'd thy high soul, and flourish'd on thy head, Those veterans to their native shores return'd, Like exiles wander'd, and like exiles mourn'd; Or, left at large no longer to bewail, Were vagrants deem'd, and destin'd to a jail! Were there no royal, yet uncultur'd lands, No wastes that wanted such subduing hands? Were Cressy's heroes such abandon'd things? O fate of war! and gratitude of kings! The Gypsey-Life. The gypsey-race my pity rarely move; Yet their strong thirst of Liberty I love. Not Wilkes, our freedom's holy martyr, more; Nor his firm phalanx, of the common shore. For this in Norwood's patrimonial groves, The tawny father with his offspring roves; When summer suns lead slow the sultry day, In mossy caves, where welling waters play, Fann'd by each gale that cools the fervid sky, With this in ragged luxury they lie. Oft at the sun the dusky elfins strain The sable eye, then, snugging, sleep again; Oft, as the dews of cooler evening fall, For their prophetic mother's mantle call. Far other cares that wandering mother wait, The mouth, and oft the minister of Fate! From her to hear, in ev'ning's friendly shade, Of future fortune, flies the village-maid, Draws her long-hoarded copper from its hold; And rusty halfpence purchase hopes of gold. But, ah! ye maids, beware the Gypsey's lures! She opens not the womb of Time, but yours. Oft has her hands the hapless Marian wrung, Marian, whom Gay in sweetest strains has sung! The parson's maid—sore cause had she to rue The Gypsey's tongue; the parson's daughter too. Long had that anxious daughter sigh'd to know What Vellum's sprucy clerk, the valley's beau, Meant by those glances, which at church he stole, Her father nodding to the psalm's slow drawl; Long had she sigh'd, at length a prophet came, By many a sure prediction known to fame, To Marian known, and all she told, for true: She knew the future, for the past she knew. Where, in the darkling shed, the moon's dim rays Beam'd on the ruins of a one-horse chaise Villaria sate, while faithful Marian brought The wayward prophet of the woe she sought. Twice did her hands, the income of the week, On either side, the crooked sixpence seek; Twice were those hands withdrawn from either side, To stop the titt'ring laugh, the blush to hide. The wayward prophet made no long delay, No novice she in Fortune's devious way! “Ere yet,” she cried, “ten rolling months are o'er, “Must ye be mothers; maids, at least no more. “With you shall soon, O lady fair, prevail “A gentle youth, the flower of this fair vale. “To Marian, once of Colin Clout the scorn, “Shall bumkin come, and bumkinets be born.” Smote to the heart, the maidens marvell'd sore, That ten short months had such events in store; But holding firm, what village-maids believe, ‘That strife with fate is milking in a sieve;’ To prove their prophet true, tho' to their cost, They justly thought no time was to be lost. These foes to youth, that seek, with dang'rous art, To aid the native weakness of the heart; These miscreants from thy harmless village drive, As wasps felonious from the lab'ring hive. END OF THE FIRST PART. PART THE SECOND. TO ROBERT WILSON CRACROFT, ESQ. Born with a gentle heart, and born to please With native goodness, of no fortune vain, The social aspect of inviting ease, The kind opinion, and the sense humane; To thee, my Cracroft, whom, in early youth, With lenient hand, and anxious love I led Thro' paths where science points to manly truth, And glory gilds the mansions of the dead: To thee this offering of maturer thought, That, since wild Fancy flung the lyre aside, With heedful hand the Moral Muse hath wrought, That Muse devotes, and bears with honest pride. Yet not that period of the human year, When Fancy reign'd, shall we with pain review, All Nature's seasons different aspects wear, And now her flowers, and now her fruits are due. Not that in youth we rang'd the smiling meads, On Essex' shores the trembling angle play'd, Urging at noon the slow boat in the reeds, That wav'd their green uncertainty of shade. Nor yet the days consum'd in Hackthorn's vale, That lonely on the heath's wild bosom lies, Should we with stern severity bewail, And all the lighter hours of life despise. For Nature's seasons different aspects wear, And now her flowers, and now her fruits are due; A while she freed us from the scourge of Care, But told us then—for social ends we grew. To find some virtue trac'd on life's short page, Some mark of service paid to human kind, Alone can chear the wintry paths of age, Alone support the far-reflecting mind. Oh! often thought—when Smith's discerning care To further days prolong'd this failing frame! To die, was little—But what heart could bear To die, and leave an undistinguish'd name? Blagdon-House, Feb. 22, 1775. Protection of the Poor.Refers to the conclusion of the First Part. Yet, while thy rod restrains the needy crew, Remember that thou art their monarch too. King of the Beggars!—Lov'st thou not the name? O, great from Ganges to the golden Tame! Far-ruling sovereign of this begging ball, Low at thy footstool other thrones shall fall. His alms to thee the whisker'd Moor convey, And Prussia's sturdy beggar own thy sway; Courts, senates—all to Baal that bend the knee, King of the beggars, these are fiefs to thee! The Mahometan Princes seem to have a regular system of begging. Nothing so common as to hear that the Dey of Algiers, &amp;c. &amp;c. are dissatisfied with their presents. It must be owned, it would be for the welfare of the world, if Princes in general would adhere to the maxim, that, “it is better to “beg than to steal.” Tu poscis vilia rerum, Quamvis fers te nullius egentem. Hor. But still, forgot the grandeur of thy reign, Descend to duties meaner crowns disdain; That worst excrescency of power forego, That pride of kings, Humanity's first foe. Let age no longer toil with feeble strife, Worn by long service in the war of life; Nor leave the head, that time hath whiten'd, bare To the rude insults of the searching air; Nor bid the knee, by labour harden'd, bend, O thou, the poor man's hope, the poor man's friend! If, when from Heav'n severer seasons fall, Fled from the frozen roof, and mouldering wall, Each face the picture of a winter-day, More strong than Teniers' pencil could pourtray;— If then to thee resort the shivering train, Of eruel days, and cruel man complain, Say to thy heart [remembering him who said] ‘These people come from far, and have no bread.’ Nor leave thy venal clerk empower'd to hear; The voice of want is sacred to thy ear. He, where no fees his sordid pen invite, Sports with their tears, too indolent to write; Like the fed monkey in the fable, vain To hear more helpless animals complain. But chief thy notice shall one monster claim, A monster furnish'd with a human frame, The parish-officer!—tho' Verse disdain Terms that deform the splendor of the strain; It stoops to bid thee bend the brow severe On the sly, pilfering, cruel overseer; The shuffling farmer, faithful to no trust, Ruthless as rocks, insatiate as the dust! When the poor hind, with length of years decay'd, Leans feebly on his once subduing spade, Forgot the service of his abler days, His profitable toil, and honest praise, Shall this low wretch abridge his scanty bread, This slave, whose board his former labours spread? When harvest's burning suns and sick'ning air From labour's unbrac'd hand the grasp'd hook tear, Where shall the helpless family be fed, That vainly languish for a father's bread? See the pale mother, sunk with grief and care, To the proud farmer fearfully repair; Soon to be sent with insolence away, Referr'd to vestries, and a distant day! Referr'd—to perish!—Is my verse severe? Unfriendly to the human character? Ah! to this sigh of sad experience trust. The truth is rigid, but the tale is just. If in thy courts this caitiff wretch appear, Think not, that patience were a virtue here. His low-born pride with honest rage controul; Smite his hard heart, and shake his reptile soul. But, hapless! oft thro' fear of future woe, And certain vengeance of th' insulting foe, Oft, ere to thee the poor prefer their pray'r, The last extremes of penury they bear. Wouldst thou then raise thy patriot office higher, To something more than magistrate aspire? And, left each poorer, pettier chace behind, Step nobly forth, the friend of human kind? The game I start courageously pursue! Adieu to fear! to indolence adieu! And, first we'll range this mountain's stormy side, Where the rude winds the shepherd's roof deride, As meet no more the wintry blast to bear, And all the wild hostilities of air. —That roof have I remember'd many a year; It once gave refuge to a hunted deer— Here, in those days, we found an aged pair;— But Time untenants—Hah! what seest thou there? “Horror!—By Heav'n, extended on a bed “Of naked fearn, two human creatures dead! “Embracing as alive!—ah, no!—no life! “Cold, breathless!” 'Tis the shepherd and his wife. I knew the scene, and brought thee to behold What speaks more strongly than the story told. They died thro' want— “By every power I swear, “If the wretch treads the earth, or breathes the air, “Thro' whose default of duty, or design, “These victims fell, he dies.” They fell by thine. “Infernal!—Mine!—by—” Swear on no pretence: A swearing Justice wants both grace and sense. When thy good father held this wide domain, The voice of sorrow never mourn'd in vain. Sooth'd by his pity, by his bounty fed, The sick found med'cine, and the aged bread. He left their interest to no parish-care, No bailiff urg'd his little empire there: No village-tyrant starv'd them, or oppress'd; He learnt their wants, and he those wants redress'd. E'en these, unhappy! who, beheld too late, Smote thy young heart with horror at their fate, His bounty found, and destin'd here to keep A small detachment of his mountain-sheep. Still pleas'd to see them from the annual fair Th' unwritten history of their profits bear; More nobly pleas'd those profits to restore, And, if their fortune fail'd them, make it more. When Nature gave her precept to remove His kindred spirit to the realms of love, Afar their anguish from thy distant ear, No arm to save, and no protection near, Led by the lure of unaccounted gold, Thy bailiff seiz'd their little flock, and sold. Their want contending parishes survey'd, And this disown'd, aud that refus'd to aid: A while, who should not succour them, they tried, And in that while the wretched victims died. “I'll scalp that bailiff—sacrifice.” In vain To rave at mischief, if the cause remain! O days long lost to man in each degree! The golden days of hospitality! When liberal fortunes vied with liberal strife To fill the noblest offices of life; When Wealth was Virtue's handmaid, and her gate Gave a free refuge from the wrongs of fate; The poor at hand their natural patrons saw, And lawgivers were supplements of law! Lost are those days, and Fashion's boundless sway Has borne the guardian magistrate away. Save in Augusta's streets, on Gallia's shore, The rural patron is beheld no more. No more the poor his kind protection share, Unknown their wants, and unreceiv'd their pray'r. Yet has that Fashion, long so light and vain, Reform'd at last, and led the moral train? Have her gay vot'ries nobler worth to boast For Nature's love, for Nature's virtue lost? No—fled from these, the sons of fortune find What poor respect to wealth remains behind. The mock regard alone of menial slaves, The worship'd calves of their outwitting knaves! Foregone the social, hospitable days, When wide vales echo'd with their owner's praise, Of all that ancient consequence bereft, What has the modern Man of Fashion left? Does he, perchance, to rural scenes repair, And “waste his sweetness” on the essenc'd air? Ah! gently lave the feeble frame he brings, Ye scouring seas! and ye sulphureous springs! And thou, Brighthelmstone, where no cits annoy, (All borne to Margate, in the Margate-hoy,) Where, if the hasty creditor advance, Lies the light skiff, and ever-bailing France, Do thou defend him in the dog-day suns! Secure in winter from the rage of duns! While the grim catchpole, the grim porter swear, One that he is, and one, he is not there, The tortur'd us'rer, as he murmurs by, Eyes the Venetian blinds, and heaves a sigh. O, from each title folly ever took, Blood! Maccarone! Cicisbeo! or Rook! From each low passion, from each low resort, The thieving alley, nay, the righteous court, From Bertie's, Almack's, Arthur's, and the nest Where Judah's ferrets earth with Charles unblest;— From these and all the garbage of the great, At Honour's, Freedom's, Virtue's call—retreat! Has the fair vale, where rest, conceal'd in flowers, Lies in sweet ambush for thy careless hours, The breeze, that, balmy fragrance to infuse, Bathes its soft wing in aromatic dews, The stream, to soothe thine ear, to cool thy breast, That mildly murmurs from its crystal rest;— Have these less charms to win, less power to please, Than haunts of rapine, harbours of disease? Will no kind slumbers o'er thine eyelids creep, Save where the sullen watchman growls at sleep? Does morn no sweeter, purer breath diffuse Than steams thro' alleys from the lungs of Jews? And is thy water, pent in putrid wood, Bethesda-like, when troubled only good? Is it thy passion Linley's voice to hear, And has no mountain-lark detain'd thine ear? Song marks alone the tribes of airy wing; For, trust me, man was never meant to sing: And all his mimic organs e'er exprest, Was but an imitative howl at best. Is it on Garrick's attitude you doat? See on the pointed cliff yon lordly goat! Like Lear's, his beard descends in graceful snow, And wild he looks upon the world below. Superior here the scene in every part! Here reigns great Nature, and there little art! Here let thy life assume a nobler plan, To Nature faithful, and the friend of man! Unnumber'd objects ask thy honest care, Beside the orphan's tear, the widow's pray'r. Far as thy power can save, thy bounty bless, Unnumber'd evils call for thy redress. Seest thou afar yon solitary thorn, Whose aged limbs the heath's wild winds have torn? While yet to cheer the homeward shepherd's eye, A few seem straggling in the ev'ning sky! Not many suns have hasten'd down the day, Or blushing moons immers'd in clouds their way, Since there a scene, that stain'd their sacred light, With horror stopp'd a felon in his flight; A babe just born that signs of life exprest, Lay naked o'er the mother's lifeless breast. The pitying robber, conscious that, pursu'd, He had no time to waste, yet stood and view'd; To the next cot the trembling infant bore, And gave a part of what he stole before; Nor known to him the wretches were, nor dear, He felt as man, and dropp'd a human tear. Far other treatment she who breathless lay, Found from a viler animal of prey. Worn with long toil on many a painful road, That toil increas'd by Nature's growing load, When ev'ning brought the friendly hour of rest, And all the mother throng'd about her breast, The ruffian officer oppos'd her stay, And, cruel, bore her in her pangs away, So far beyond the town's last limits drove, That to return were hopeless, had she strove. Abandon'd there—with famine, pain and cold, And anguish, she expir'd—the rest I've told. “Now let me swear—For, by my soul's last sigh, “That thief shall live, that overseer shall die.” Too late!—His life the gen'rous robber paid, Lost by that pity which his steps delay'd! No soul-discerning Mansfield sate to hear, No Hertford bore his prayer to mercy's ear; No lib'ral justice first assign'd the gaol, Or urg'd, as Camplin would have urg'd his tale. The living object of thy honest rage, Old in parochial crimes, and steel'd with age, The grave church-warden! unabash'd he bears Weekly to church his book of wicked prayers. And pours, with all the blasphemy of praise, His creeping soul in Sternhold's creeping lays! END OF THE SECOND PART. PART THE THIRD. TO THOMAS SMITH, M.D. Of Wrington, in the County of Somerset, THIS LAST OF THE LITTLE POEMS, INTENDED TO CULTIVATE, IN THE PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, THAT HUMANITY BY WHICH HE IS SO AMIABLY DISTINGUISHED, IS GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED BY HIS MOST OBLIGED, MOST AFFECTIONATE, AND MOST FAITHFUL SERVANT, THE AUTHOR. Depredation. O, No! Sir John—the Muse's gentle art Lives not to blemish, but to mend the heart. While Gay's brave robber grieves us for his fate, We hold the harpies of his life in hate. Ingenuous youth, by Nature's voice addrest, Finds not the harden'd, but the feeling breast; Can form no wish the dire effects to prove Of lawless valour, or of venal love, Approves the fondness of the faithful maid, And mourns a gen'rous passion unrepaid. Yet would I praise the pious zeal that saves Imperial London from her world of knaves; Yet would I count it no inglorious strife To scourge the pests of property and life. Come then, long skill'd in theft's illusive ways, Lord of the clue that thrids her mighty maze! Together let us beat all Giles's fields, Try what the night-house, what the round-house yields, Hang when we must, be candid when we please, But leave no bawd, unlicens'd, at her ease. Say first, of thieves above, or thieves below, What can we order till their haunts we know? Far from St.James's let your Nimrods stray, But stop and call at Stephen's in their way. That ancient victualler, we've been told, of late, Has kept bad hours, encourag'd high debate; That those without still pelting those within, Have stunn'd the peaceful neighbours with their din; That if you close his private walls invest, 'Tis odds, you meet with some unruly guest— Good Lord, Sir John, how would the people stare, To see the present and the late Lord Mayor, This was written about the year 1776. Bow to the majesty of Bow-street chair! Illustrious chiefs! can I your haunts pass by, Nor give my long-lov'd Liberty a sigh? That heav'nly plant which long unblemish'd blew, Dishonour'd only, only hurt by you! Dishonour'd, when with harden'd front you claim To deeds of darkness her diviner name! For you grim Licence strove with hydra breath To spread the blasts of pestilence and death: Here for poor vice, for dark ambition there She scatter'd poison thro' the social air. Yet here, in vain—Oh, had her toil been vain, When with black wing she swept the western main; When with low labour, and insidious art, She tore a daughter from her parent's heart! Oh, Patriots, ever patriots out of place, Fair Honour's foil, and Liberty's disgrace! With spleen I see your wild illusions spread Thro' the long region of a land misled; See commerce sink, see cultivation's charms Lost in the rage of anarchy and arms! And thou, O Ch—m, once a nation's pride, Borne on the brightest wave of glory's tide! Hast thou the parent spurn'd, the erring child With prospects vain to ruin's arms beguil'd? Hast thou the plans of dire defection prais'd For the poor pleasure of a statue rais'd? Oh, Patriots, ever patriots out of place, From Charles quite graceless, up to Grafton's grace! Where forty-five once mark'd the dirty door, And the chain'd knife Chained to the table, to prevent depredations. invites the paltry whore; Tho' far, methinks, the choicest guests are fled, And Wilkes and Humphrey number'd with the dead, Wilkes, who in death would friendship's vows fulfil, True to his cause, and dines with Humphrey still— Where sculks each dark, where roams each desp'rate wight, Owls of the day and vultures of the night,— Shall we, O Knight, with cruel pains explore, Clear these low walks, and think the bus'ness o'er? No—much, alas! for you, for me remains, Where Justice sleeps, and Depredation reigns. Wrapt in kind darkness, you no spleen betray, When the gilt Nabob lacqueys all the way: Harmless to you his towers, his forests rise, That swell with anguish my indignant eyes; While in those towers raz'd villages I see, And tears of orphans watering every tree. Are these mock-ruins that invade my view? These are the entrails of the poor Gentoo. That column's trophied base his bones supply; That lake the tears that swell'd his sable eye! Let here, O Knight, their steps terrific steer Thy hue and cry, and loose thy bloodhounds here. Oh, Mercy, thron'd on his eternal breast, Who breath'd the savage waters into rest; By each soft pleasure that thy bosom smote, When first creation started from his thought; By each warm tear that melted o'er thine eye, When on his works was written ‘These must die!’ If secret slaughter yet, nor cruel war Have from these mortal regions forc'd thee far, Still to our follies, to our frailties blind, Oh, stretch thy healing wings o'er human kind! —For them I ask not, hostile to thy sway, Who calmly on a brother's vitals prey; For them I plead not, who, in blood embru'd, Have ev'ry softer sentiment subdu'd. Prisons. Yet, gentle power, thy absence I bewail, When seen the dank, dark regions of a gaol; When found alike in chains and night enclos'd, The thief detected, and the thief suppos'd! Sure, the fair light and the salubrious air Each yet-sus pected prisoner might share. —To lie, to languish in some dreary cell, Some loathed hold, where guilt and horror dwell, Ere yet the truth of seeming facts be tried, Ere yet their country's sacred voice decide, Britain, behold thy citizens expos'd, And blush to think the Gothic age unclos'd! Filiation. Oh, more than Goths, who yet decline to raze That pest of James's puritanic days, The savage law 7I. c. 4. that barb'rously ordains For female virtue lost a felon's pains!— Dooms the poor maiden, as her fate severe, To toil and chains a long-enduring year. Th' unnatural monarch, to the sex unkind, An owl obscene, in learning's sunshine blind! Councils of pathics, cabinets of tools, Benches of knaves, and parliaments of fools! Fanatic fools, that, in those twilight times, With wild religion cloak'd the worst of crimes!— Hope we from such a crew, in such a reign, For equal laws, or policy humane? Here, then, O Justice, thy own power forbear; The sole protector of th' unpitied fair. Tho' long intreat the ruthless overseer; Tho' the loud vestry tease thy tortur'd ear; Tho' all to acts, to precedents appeal, Mute be thy pen, and vacant rest thy seal. Yet shalt thou know, nor is the diff'rence nice, The casual fall from impudence of vice. Abandon'd guilt by active laws restrain, But pause.....if Virtue's slightest spark remain. Left to the shameless lash, the hard'ning gaol, The fairest thoughts of modesty would fail. The down-cast eye, the tear that flows amain, As if to ask her innocence again; The plaintive babe, that slum'bring seem'd to lie On her soft breast, and wakes at the heav'd sigh; The cheek that wears the beauteous robe of shame; How loth they leave a gentle breast to blame! Here, then, O Justice, thy own power forbear;— The sole protector of th' unpitied fair! THE ORIGIN OF THE VEIL. Warm from this heart while flows the faithful line, The meanest friend of beauty shall be mine. What Love, or Fame, or Fortune could bestow, The charm of praise, the ease of life I owe To Beauty present, or to Beauty fled, To Hertford living, or Caernarvon dead, To Tweedale's taste, to Edgecumbe's sense serene, And, Envy spare this boast, to Britain's Queen. Kind to the lay that all unlabour'd flow'd, What Fancy caught, where Nature's pencil glow'd, The Fables of Flora. She saw the path to new, tho' humble fame, Gave me her praise, and left me fools to blame. Strong in their weakness are each woman's charms, Dread that endears, and softness that disarms. The tim'rous eye retiring from applause, And the mild air that fearfully withdraws, Marks of our power these humble graces prove, And, dash'd with pride, we deeper drink of Love. Chief of those charms that hold the heart in thrall, At thy fair shrine, O Modesty, we fall. Not Cynthia rising o'er the wat'ry way, When on the dim wave falls her friendly ray; Not the pure æther of Æolian skies, That drinks the day's first glories as they rise; Not all the tints from evening-clouds that break, Burn in the beauties of the virgin's cheek; When o'er that cheek, undisciplin'd by art, The sweet suffusion rushes from the heart. Yet the soft blush, untutor'd to controul, The glow that speaks the susceptible soul, Led by nice honour, and by decent pride, The voice of ancient virtue taught to hide; Taught beauty's bloom the searching eye to shun, As early flowers blow fearful of the sun. Far as the long records of time we trace, Plato mentions two provinces in Persia, one of which was called the Queen's Girdle, the other the Queen's Veil, the revenues of which, no doubt, were employed in purchasing those parts of her Majesty's dress. It was about the middle of the third century, that the eastern women, on taking the vow of virginity, assumed that veil which had before been worn by the Pagan pricstesses, and which is used by the religious among the Romanists now. Still flow'd the Veil o'er modesty's fair face: The guard of beauty, in whose friendly shade, Safe from each eye the featur'd soul is laid,— The pensive thought that paler looks betray, The tender grief that steals in tears away, The hopeless wish that prompts the frequent sigh, Bleeds in the blush, or melts upon the eye. The man of faith thro' Gerar doom'd to stray, A nation waiting his eventful way, His fortune's fair companion at his side, The world his promise, Providence his guide; Once, more than virtue dar'd to value life, And call'd a sister whom he own'd a wife. Mistaken father of the faithful race, Thy fears alone could purchase thy disgrace. “Go,” to the fair, when conscious of the tale, Said Gerar's Prince, “thy husband is thy veil.” He is the veil of thine eyes to all that are with thee, and to all others.—Gen. xx. 16. Vet. Trans. O ancient faith! O virtue mourn'd in vain! When Hymen's altar never held a stain; When his pure torch shed undiminish'd rays, And fires unholy died beneath the blaze! For faith like this fair Greece was early known, And claim'd the Veil's first honours as her own. Ere half her sons, o'er Asia's trembling coast, Arm'd to revenge one woman's virtue lost; Ere he, whom Circe sought to charm in vain, Follow'd wild fortune o'er the various main, In youth's gay bloom he plied th' exulting oar, From Ithaca's white rocks to Sparta's shore: Free to Nerician gales From the mountain Neritos in Ithaca, now called Nericia. the vessel glides, And wild Eurotas The Spartan river. smoothes his warrior tides; For am'rous Greece, when Love conducts the way, Beholds her waters, and her winds obey.

With all that soothes the heart, that wins, or warms, All princely virtues, and all manly charms, All Love can urge, or Eloquence persuade, The future hero woo'd his Spartan maid. Yet long he woo'd—in Sparta slow to yield, Beauty, like valour, long maintain'd the field. “No bloom so fair Messene's banks disclose, “No breath so pure o'er Tempe's bosom blows; “No smile so radiant throws the genial ray “Thro' the fair eye-lids of the op'ning day; “But deaf to vows with fondest psssion prest, “Cold as the wave of Hebrus' wint'ry breast, “Penelope regards no lover's pain, “And owns Ulysses eloquent in vain. “To vows that vainly waste their warmth in air, “Insidious hopes that lead but to despair, “Affections lost, desires the heart must rue, “And Love, and Sparta's joyless plains, adieu! “Yet still this bosom shall one passion share, “Still shall my country find a father there. “Ev'n now the children of my little reign “Demand that father of the faithless main, “Ev'n now, their prince solicitous to save, “Climb the tall cliff, and watch the changeful wave. “But not for him their hopes, or fears alone! “They seek the promis'd partner of his throne; “For her their incense breathes, their altars blaze, “For her to heaven the suppliant eye they raise. “Ah! shall they know their prince implor'd in vain? “Can my heart live beneath a nation's pain?” There spoke the virtue that her soul admir'd, The Spartan soul, with patriot ardour fir'd. “Enough!” she cried—“Be mine to boast a part “In him, who holds his country to his heart. “Worth, honour, faith, that fair affection gives, “And with that virtue, ev'ry virtue lives.” Omnes omnium caritates, &amp;c.—Cic. Pleas'd that the nobler principles could move His daughter's heart, and soften it to love, Icarius own'd the auspices divine, Wove the fair crown, The women of ancient Greece, at the marriage ceremony, wore garlands of flowers, probably as emblems of purity, fertility, and beauty. Thus Euripides, ????? ???? ??? ?????????? ?????? ????, ?? ??????????? Iph.

Should he the comfort of his life's decline, His life's last charm to Ithaca resign? Or, wand'ring with her to a distant shore, Behold Eurotas' long-lov'd banks no more? Expose his grey hairs to an alien sky, Nor on his country's parent bosom die? The ancients esteemed this one of the greatest misfortunes that could befall them. The Trojans thought it the most lamentable circumstance attending the loss of their pilot Palinurus, that his body should lie in a foreign country. —Ignotâ, Palinure, jacebis arenâ. Virgil. “No, Prince,” he cried; “for Sparta's happier plain “Leave the lov'd honours of thy little reign. “The grateful change shall equal honours bring, “—Lord of himself, a Spartan is a King.” When thus the Prince, with obvious grief opprest, “Canst thou not force the father from thy breast? “Not without pain behold one child depart, “Yet bid me tear a nation from my heart? “—Not for all Sparta's, all Eubœa's plains”— He said, and to his coursers gave the reins. Still the fond sire pursues with suppliant voice, 'Till, mov'd, the Monarch yields her to her choice. “Tho' mine by vows, by fair affection mine, “And holy truth, and auspices divine, “This suit let fair Penelope decide, “Remain the daughter, or proceed the bride.” O'er the quick blush her friendly mantle fell, And told him all that modesty could tell. No longer now the father's fondness strove With patriot virtue or acknowledg'd love, But on the scene that parting sighs endear'd, Fair Modesty's Pausanias, who has recorded the story on which this little poem is founded, tells us that this was the first temple erected to Modesty in Greece. first honour'd fane he rear'd.

VERSES IN MEMORY OF A LADY. WRITTEN AT SANDGATE CASTLE, 1768. Nec tantum ingenio, quantum servire dolori. Propert. Let others boast the false and faithless pride, No nuptial charm to know, or known, to hide, With vain disguise from Nature's dictates part, For the poor triumph of a vacant heart; My verse the god of tender vows inspires, Dwells on my soul, and wakens all her fires. Dear, silent partner of those happier hours, That pass'd in Hackthorn's vales, in Blagdon's bowers! If yet thy gentle spirit wanders here, Borne by its virtues to no nobler sphere; If yet that pity which, of life possest, Fill'd thy fair eye, and lighten'd thro' thy breast; If yet that tender thought, that gen'rous care, The gloomy power of endless night may spare; Oh! while my soul for thee, for thee complains, Catch her warm sighs, and kiss her bleeding strains. Wild, wretched wish! Can pray'r with feeble breath, Pierce the pale ear, the statu'd ear of death? Let patience pray, let hope aspire to prayer! And leave me the strong language of despair! Hence ye vain painters of ingenious woe, Ye Lytteltons, ye shining Petrarchs, go! I hate the languor of your lenient strain, Your flow'ry grief, your impotence of pain. Oh! had ye known, what I have known, to prove The searching flame, the agonies of love! Oh! had ye known how souls to souls impart Their fire, or mix'd the life-drops of the heart! Not like the streams that down the mountain side, Tunefully mourn, and sparkle as they glide; Not like the breeze, that sighs at ev'ning-hour On the soft bosom of some folding flower; Your stronger grief, in stronger accents borne, Had sooth'd the breast with burning anguish torn. The voice of seas, the winds that rouse the deep, Far-sounding floods that tear the mountain's steep; Each wild and melancholy blast that raves Round these dim towers, and smites the beating waves— This soothes my soul—'tis Nature's mournful breath, 'Tis Nature struggling in the arms of death! See, the last aid of her expiring state, See Love, e'en Love, has lent his darts to fate! The lady died in child-bed. Oh! when beneath his golden shafts I bled, And vainly bound his trophies round my head; When crown'd with flowers, he led the rosy day, Liv'd to my eye, and drew my soul away— Could fear, could fancy, at that tender hour, See the dim grave demand the nuptial flower? There, there his wreathes dejected Hymen strew'd; And mourn'd their bloom unfaded as he view'd. There each fair hope, each tenderness of life, Each nameless charm of soft obliging strife, Delight, love, fancy, pleasure, genius fled, And the best passions of my soul lie dead; All, all is there in cold oblivion laid, But pale remembrance bending o'er a shade. O come, ye softer sorrows, to my breast! Ye lenient sighs, that slumber into rest! Come, soothing dreams, your friendly pinions wave, We'll bear the fresh rose to yon honour'd grave; For once this pain, this frantic pain forego, And feel at last the luxury of woe! Ye holy suff'rers, that in silence wait The last sad refuge of relieving fate! That rest at eve beneath the cypress' gloom, And sleep familiar on your future tomb; With you I'll waste the slow-departing day, And wear, with you, th' uncolour'd hours away. Oh! lead me to your cells, your lonely aisles, Where resignation folds her arms and smiles; Where holy faith unwearied vigils keeps, And guards the urn where fair Constantia See Spectator, Nor.164. sleeps: There, let me there in sweet oblivion lie, And calmly feel the tutor'd passions die. MONODY. SUNG BY A REDBREAST. The gentle pair that in these lonely shades, Wand'ring, at eve or morn, I oft have seen, Now, all in vain, I seek at eve or morn, With drooping wing, forlorn. Along the grove, along the daisied green, For them I've warbled many a summer's day, Till the light dews impearled all the plain, And the glad shepherd shut his nightly fold; Stories of love, and high adventures old Were the dear subjects of my tuneful strain. Ah! where is now the hope of all my lay? Now they, perchance, that heard them all are dead! With them the meed of melody is fled, And fled with them the list'ning ear of praise. Vainly I dreamt, that when the wint'ry sky Scatter'd the white flood on the wasted plain, When not one berry, not one leaf was nigh, To sooth keen hunger's pain, Vainly I dreamt my songs might not be vain. That oft within the hospitable hall Some scatter'd fragment haply I might find, Some friendly crumb perchance for me design'd, When seen despairing on the neighbouring wall. Deluded bird, those hopes are now no more! Dull time has blasted the departing year, And winter frowns severe, Wrapping his wan limbs in his mantle hoar. Yet not within the hospitable hall The cheerful sound of human voice I hear; No piteous eye is near, To see me drooping on the lonely wall. TO A REDBREAST. Little bird, with bosom red, Welcome to my humble shed! Courtly domes of high degree Have no room for thee and me; Pride and pleasure's fickle throng Nothing mind an idle song. Daily near my table steal, While I pick my scanty meal. Doubt not, little though there be, But I'll cast a crumb to thee; Well rewarded, if I spy Pleasure in thy glancing eye: See thee, when thou'st eat thy fill, Plume thy breast, and wipe thy bill. Come, my feather'd friend, again Well thou know'st the broken pane Ask of me thy daily store; Go not near Avaro's door; Once within his iron hall, Woeful end shall thee befall. Savage!—He would soon divest Of its rosy plumes thy breast; Then, with solitary joy, Eat thee, bones and all, my boy! A CONTEMPLATION. O Nature! grateful for the gifts of mind, Duteous I bend before thy holy shrine; To other hands be fortune's goods assign'd, And thou, more bounteous, grant me only thine. Bring gentlest Love, bring Fancy to my breast; And if wild Genius, in his devious way, Would sometimes deign to be my ev'ning guest, Or near my lone shade not unkindly stray: I ask no more! for happier gifts than these, The suff'rer, Man, was never born to prove; But may my soul eternal slumbers seize, If lost to genius, fancy, and to love! MENALCAS. A PASTORAL. Now cease your sweet pipes, shepherds! cease your lays, Ye warbling train, that fill the echoing groves With your melodious love-notes! Die, ye winds, That o'er Arcadian valleys blow! Ye streams, Ye garrulous old streams, suspend your course, And listen to Menalcas.— Menalcas. Come, fairest of the beauteous train that sport On Ladon's flow'ry side, my Delia, come! For thee thy shepherd, silent as he sits Within the green wood, sighs: for thee prepares The various wreathes in vain; explores the shade Where lowly lurks the violet blue, where droops, In tender beauty, its fair spotted bells, The cowslip: oft with plaintive voice he calls The wakeful echo—What are streams or flowers, Or songs of blithe birds? What the blushing rose, Young health, or music, or the voice of praise, The smile of vernal suns, the fragrant breath Of ev'ning gales, when Delia dwells afar? INSCRIPTIONS ON A BEECH TREE, IN THE ISLAND OF SICILY. Sweet land of Muses! o'er whose favour'd plains Ceres and Flora held alternate sway; By Jove refresh'd with life-diffusing rains, By Phœbus blest with ev'ry kinder ray? O with what pride do I those times survey, When Freedom, by her rustic minstrels led, Danc'd on the green lawn many a summer's day, While pastoral ease reclin'd her careless head. In these soft shades: ere yet that shepherd fled, Whose music pierc'd earth, air, and heav'n, and hell, And call'd the ruthless tyrant of the dead From the dark slumbers of his iron cell. His ear unfolding, caught the magic spell: He felt the sounds glide softly through his heart; The sounds that deign'd of Love's sweet power to tell; And, as they told, would point his golden dart. Fix'd was the god; nor power had he to part, For the fair daughter of the sheaf-crown'd queen, Fair without pride, and lovely without art, Gather'd her wild flowers on the daisied green. He saw, he sigh'd; and that unmelting breast, Which arms the hand of death, the power of love confest. A MONODY, INSCRIBED TO MY WORTHY FRIEND JOHN SCOTT, ESQ. BEING WRITTEN IN HIS GARDEN AT AMWELL, IN HERTFORD. SHIRE, THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1769. Friend of my genius! on whose natal hour, Shone the same star, but shone with brighter ray; Oft as amidst thy Amwell's shades I stray, And mark thy true taste in each winding bower, From my full eye why falls the tender shower, While other thoughts than these fair scenes convey, Bear on my trembling mind, and melt its powers away? Ah me! my friend! in happier hours I spread, Like thee, the wild walk o'er the varied plain; The fairest tribe of Flora's painted train, Each bolder shrub that grac'd her genial bed, When old Sylvanus, by young wishes led, Stole to her arms, of such fair offspring vain, That bore their mother's beauties on their head. Like thee, inspir'd by love—'twas Delia's charms, Twas Delia's taste the new creation gave: For her my groves in plaintive sighs would wave, And call her absent to their master's arms. She comes—Ye flowers, your fairest blooms unfold, Ye waving groves, your plaintive sighs forbear! Breathe all your sragrance to the am'rous air, Ye smiling shrubs whose heads are cloth'd with gold! She comes, by truth, by fair affection led, The long lov'd mistress of my faithful heart! The mistress of my soul, no more to part, And all my hopes and all my vows are sped. Vain, vain delusions! dreams for ever fled! Ere twice the spring had wak'd the genial hour, The lovely parent bore one beauteous flower, And droop'd her gentle head, And sunk, for ever sunk, into her silent bed. Friend of my genius! partner of my fate! To equal sense of painful suffering born! From whose fond breast a lovely parent torn, Bedew'd thy pale cheek with a tear so late— Oh! let us mindful of the short, short date, That bears the spoil of human hopes away, Indulge sweet mem'ry of each happier day! No! close, for ever close the iron gate Of cold oblivion on that dreary cell, Where the pale shades of past enjoyments dwell, And, pointing to their bleeding bosoms, say, On life's disastrous hour what varied woes await! Let scenes of softer, gentler kind, A wake to fancy's soothing call, And milder on the pensive mind, The shadow'd thought of grief shall fall. Oft as the slowly-closing day Draws her pale mantle from the dew-star's eye, What time the shepherd's cry Leads from the pastur'd hills his flocks away, Attentive to the tender lay That steals from Philomela's breast, Let us in musing silence stray, Where Lee beholds in mazes slow His uncomplaining waters flow, And all his whisp'ring shores invite the charms of rest. IMITATION OF WALLER. WALLER TO ST. EVREMOND. O Vales of Penshurst, now so long unseen! Forgot each shade secure, each winding green; Those lonely paths, what art have I to tread, Where once young Love, the blind enthusiast, led? Yet if the genius of your conscious groves His Sidney in my Sacharissa loves; Let him with pride her cruel power unfold; By him my pains let Evremond be told. THE DUCHESS OF MAZARINE. ON HER RETIRING INTO A CONVENT. Ye holy cares that haunt these lonely cells, These scenes where salutary sadness dwells; Ye sighs that minute the slow wasting day, Ye pale regrets that wear my life away; O bid these passions for the world depart, These wild desires, and vanities of heart, Hide every trace of vice, of follies past, And yield to heaven the victory at last. To that the poor remains of life are due, 'Tis heaven that calls, and I the call pursue. Lord of my life, my future cares are thine, My love, my duty greet thy holy shrine: No more my heart to vainer hopes I give, But live for thee, whose bounty bids me live. The power that gave these little charms their grace, His favours bounded, and confin'd their space; Spite of those charms shall time, with rude essay, Tear from the cheek the transient rose away. But the free mind, ten thousand ages past, Its Maker's form, shall with its Maker last. Uncertain objects still our hopes employ; Uncertain all that bears the name of joy! Of all that feels the injuries of fate Uncertain is the search, and short the date, Yet ev'n that boon what thousands wish to gain? That boon of death, the sad resource of pain! Once on my path all Fortune's glory fell, Her vain magnificence, and courtly swell: Love touch'd my soul at least with soft desires, And Vanity there fed her meteor fires, This truth at last the mighty scenes let fall, An hour of innocence was worth them all. Lord of my life! O, let thy sacred ray Shine o'er my heart, and break its clouds away, Deluding, flattering, faithless world, adieu! Long hast thou taught me, God is only true! That God alone I trust, alone adore, No more deluded, and misled no more. Come, sacred hour, when wav'ring doubts shall cease! Come, holy scenes of long repose and peace! Yet shall my heart, to other interests true, A moment balance 'twixt the world and you? Of pensive nights, of long-reflecting days, Be yours, at last, the triumph and the praise. Great, gracious Master, whose unbounded sway, Felt thro' ten thousand worlds, those worlds obey; Wilt thou for once thy awful glories shade, And deign t'espouse the creature thou hast made? All other ties indignant I disclaim, Dishonour'd those, and infamous to name! O fatal ties for which such tears I've shed, For which the pleasures of the world lay dead! That world's soft pleasures you alone disarm; That world without you, still might have its charm. But now those scenes of tempting hope I close, And seek the peaceful studies of repose; Look on the past as time that stole away, And beg the blessings of a happier day. Ye gay saloons, ye golden-vested halls, Scenes of high treats and heart-bewitching balls! Dress, figure, splendour, charms of play, farewell, And all the toilet's science to excel; E'en Love that ambush'd in this beauteous hair, No more shall lie, like Indian archers, there. Go, erring love! for nobler objects given! Go beauteous hair, a sacrifice to heaven! Soon shall the veil these glowing features hide, At once the period of their power and pride. The helpless lover shall no more complain Of vows unheard, or unrewarded pain; While calmly sleep in each untortur'd breast My secret sorrow, and his sighs profest. Go, flattering train! and, slaves to me no more, With the same sighs some happier fair adore! Your alter'd faith I blame not, nor bewail— And haply yet, (what woman is not frail?) Yet, haply, might I calmer minutes prove, If he that lov'd me knew no other love! Yet were that ardour, which his breast inspir'd, By charms of more than mortal beauty fir'd; What nobler pride! could I to heaven resign The zeal, the service that I boasted mine! O, change your false desires, ye flattering train, And love me pious, whom ye lov'd profane! These long adieus with lovers doom'd to go, Or prove their merit, or my weakness show, But heaven, to such soft frailties less severe, May spare the tribute of a female tear, May yield one tender moment to deplore Those gentle hearts that I must hold no more. THE AMIABLE KING. The free-born Muse her tribute rarely brings, Or burns her incense to the power of kings; But Virtue ever shall her voice command, Alike a spade or sceptre in her hand. Is there a prince untainted with a throne, That makes the interest of mankind his own; Whose bounty knows no bounds of time or place; Who nobly feels for all the human race: A prince that acts in Reason's steady sphere, No slave to passion, and no dupe to fear; A breast where mild humanity resides, Where virtue dictates, and where wisdom guides; A mind that, stretch'd beyond the years of youth, Explores the secret springs of taste and truth? These, these are virtues which the Muse shall sing; And plant, for these, her laurels round a king! Britannia's monarch! this shall be thy praise; For this be crown'd with never-fading bays! THE HAPPY VILLAGER. Virtue dwells in Arden's vale; There her hallow'd temples rise; There her incense greets the skies, Grateful as the morning gale; There, with humble Peace, and her, Lives the happy Villager; There, the golden smiles of morn Brighter every field adorn; There the sun's declining ray Fairer paints the parting day: There the woodlark louder sings, Zephyr moves on softer wings, Groves in greener honours rise, Purer azure spreads the skies; There the fountains clearer flow, Flowers in brighter beauty blow; For, with Peace and Virtue, there Lives the happy Villager. Distant still from Arden's vale Are the woes the bad bewail; Distant fell Remorse, and Pain, And Frenzy smiling o'er her chain! Grief's quick pang, Despair's dead groan, Are in Arden's vale unknown: For with Peace and Virtue, there Lives the happy Villager! In his hospitable cell, Love, and Truth, and Freedom dwell; And, with aspect mild and free, The graceful nymph, Simplicity. Hail, ye liberal graces, hail! Natives all of Arden's vale: For, with Peace and Virtue, there Lives the happy Villager. HYMENEAL. ON THE MARRIAGE OF HIS PRESENT MAJESTY. Awake, thou everlasting lyre! That once the mighty Pindar strung, When wrapt with more than mortal fire, The gods of Greece he sung! Awake! Arrest the rapid foot of Time again With liquid notes of joy, and pleasure's melting strain. Crown'd with each beauteous flower that blows On Acidalia's tuneful side; With all Aonia's rosy pride, Where numerous Aganippe flows; From Thespian groves and fountains wild, Come, thou yellow-vested boy, Redolent of youth and joy, See Catullus. Fair Urania's favour'd child! George to thee devotes the day: To Hymen, haste away! Daughter of the genial main! Queen of youth and rosy smiles, Queen of dimple dwelling wiles; Come with all thy Paphian train: O, give the fair that blooms for Britain's throne, Thy melting charms of love, thy soul-enchanting zone! Daughter of the genial main! Bring that heart-dissolving power, Which once in Ida's sacred bower The soul of Jove oppos'd in vain: The sire of gods thy conqu'ring charms confess'd; And, vanquish'd, sunk, sunk down on Juno's fost'ring breast. She comes, the conscious sea subsides; Old Ocean curbs his thund'ring tides: Smooth the silken surface lies, Where Venus' flow'ry chariot flies: Paphian airs in ambush sleep On the still bosom of the deep; Paphian maids around her more, Keen-ey'd Hope, and Joy, and Love: Their rosy breasts a thousand Cupids lave, And dip their wanton wings, and beat the buxom wave. But mark, of more than vulgar mien, With regal grace and radiant eye, A form in youthful majesty! Britain, hail thy favour'd queen! For her the conscious sea subsides; Old Ocean curbs his thund'ring tides, O'er the glassy bosom'd main Venus leads her laughing train; The Paphian maids move graceful by her side, And o'er the buxom waves the rosy Cupids ride. Fly, ye fairy-footed hours! Fly, with aromatic flowers! Such as bath'd in orient dews, Beauty's living glow diffuse; Such as in Idalia's grove Breathe the sweets, the soul of love! Come, genial god of chaste delight, With wreathes of festive roses crown'd, And torch that burns with radiance bright, And lib'ral robe that sweeps the ground! Bring the days of golden joy, Pleasures pure, that never cloy! Bring to Britain's happy pair, All that's kind, and good, and fair! George to thee devotes the day: To Hymen, haste away. Daughters of Jove! ye virgins sage, That wait on Camus' hoary age; That oft his winding vales along Have smooth'd your silver-woven song; O wake once more those lays sublime, That live beyond the wrecks of time! To crown your Albion's boasted pair, The never-fading wreath prepare; While her rocks echo to this grateful strain, “The friends of freedom and of Britain's reign.” SONG. ['Tis o'er, the pleasing prospect's o'er!] 'Tis o'er, the pleasing prospect's o'er! My weary heart can hope no more— Then welcome, wan despair! Approach with all thy dreadful train! Wild anguish, discontent and pain, And thorny pillow'd care! Gay hope, and ease, and joy, and rest, All, all that charms the peaceful breast, For ever I resign. Let pale anxiety instead, That has not where to lay her head, And lasting woe be mine. It comes! I feel the painful woe— My eyes for Solyman will flow In silent grief again; Who, wand'ring o'er some mountain drear, Now haply sheds the pensive tear, And calls on me in vain. Perhaps, along the lonely shores, He now the sea's blue breast explores, To watch the distant sail; Perhaps, on Sundah's hills forlorn, He faints, with aching toil o'erborn, And life's last spirits fail. Ah, no! the cruel thought forbear! Avaunt, thou fiend of fell despair, That only death canst give! While Heav'n eternal rules above, Almena yet may find her love, And Solyman may live! WRITTEN IN A COTTAGE-GARDEN, AT A VILLAGE IN LORRAIN. OCCASIONED BY A TRADITION CONCERNING A TREE OF ROSEMARY. “Arbustum loquitur.” O thou, whom love and fancy lead To wander near this woodland hill, If ever music smooth'd thy quill, Or pity wak'd thy gentle reed, Repose beneath my humble tree, If thou lov'st simplicity. Stranger, if thy lot has laid In toilsome scenes of busy life, Full sorely may'st thou rue the strife Of weary passions ill repaid. In a garden live with me, If thou lov'st simplicity. Flowers have sprung for many a year O'er the village maiden's grave, That, one memorial-spring to save, Bore it from a sister's bier; And, homeward walking, wept o'er me The true tears of simplicity. And soon, her cottage window near, With care my slender stem she plac'd; And fondly thus her grief embrac'd; And cherish'd sad remembrance dear: For love sincere, and friendship free Are children of simplicity. When past was many a painful day, Slow-pacing o'er the village green, In white were all its maidens seen, And bore my guardian friends away. Ah death! what sacrifice to thee, The ruins of simplicity. One gen'rous swain her heart approv'd, A youth whose fond and faithful breast With many an artless sigh confess'd, In Nature's language, that he lov'd: But, stranger, 'tis no tale to thee, Unless thou lov'st simplicity. He died—and soon her lip was cold, And soon her rosy cheek was pale; The village wept to hear the tale, When for both the slow bell toll'd— Beneath yon flow'ry turf they lie, The lovers of simplicity. Yet one boon have I to crave; Stranger, if thy pity bleed, Wilt thou do one tender deed, And strew my pale flowers o'er their grave? So lightly lie the turf on thee, Because thou lov'st simplicity. THE PASTORAL PART OF MILTON'S EPITAPHIUM DAMONIS. O for the soft lays of Himeria's maids! The strains that died in Arethusa's shades; Tun'd to wild sorrow on her mournful shore, When Daphnis, Hylas, Bion breath'd no more! Thames' vocal wave shall ev'ry note prolong, And all his villas learn the Doric song. How Thyrsis mourn'd his long liv'd Damon dead, What sighs he utter'd, and what tears he shed— Ye dim retreats, ye wandering fountains know, Ye desert wilds bore witness to his woe: Where oft in grief he past the tedious day, Or lonely languish'd the dull night away. Twice had the fields their blooming honours bore. And Autumn twice resign'd his golden store, Unconscious of his loss, while Thyrsis staid To woo the sweet muse in the Tuscan shade: Crown'd with her favour, when he sought again His flock forsaken, and his native plain; When to his old elm's wonted shade return'd— Then—then, he miss'd his parted friend—and mourn'd. And go, he cry'd, my tender lambs, adieu! Your wretched master has no time for you. Yet are there pow'rs divine in earth or sky? Gods can they be who destin'd thee to die? And shalt thou mix with shades of vulgar name; Lost thy fair honours, and forgot thy fame? Not he, the god whose golden wand restrains The pale-ey'd people of the gloomy plains, Of Damon's fate shall thus regardless be, Or suffer vulgar shades to herd with thee. Then go, he cry'd, &amp;c. Yet while one strain my trembling tongue may try, Not unlamented, shepherd, shalt thou die. Long in these fields thy fame shall flourish fair, And Daphnis only greater honours share; To Daphnis only purer vows be paid, While Pan or Pales loves the vulgar shade. If truth or science may survive the grave, Or, what is more, a poet's friendship save. Then go, &amp;c. These, these are thine: for me what hopes remain? Save of long sorrow, and of anguish vain. For who, still faithful to my side, shall go, Like thee, through regions clad with chilling snow? Like thee, the rage of fiery summers bear, When fades the wan flower in the burning air? The lurking dangers of the chase essay, Or sooth with song and various tales the day? Then go, &amp;c. To whom shall I my hopes and fears impart? Or trust the cares and follies of my heart? Whose gentle councils put those cares to flight? Whose cheerful converse cheat the tedious night? The social hearth when autumn's treasures store, Chill blow the winds without, and thro' the bleak elm roar Then go, &amp;c. When the fierce suns of summer noons invade, And Pan reposes in the green-wood shade, The shepherds hide, the nymphs plunge down the deep, And waves the hedge-row o'er the ploughman's sleep. Ah! who shall charm with such address refin'd, Such attic wit, and elegance of mind? Then go, &amp;c. Alas! now lonely round my fields I stray, And lonely seek the pasture's wonted way. Or in some dim vale's mournful shade repose— There pensive wait the weary day's slow close, While showers descend, the gloomy tempest raves, And o'er my head the struggling twilight waves. Then go, &amp;c. Where once fair harvest cloath'd my cultur'd plain, Now weeds obscene and vexing brambles reign; The groves of myrtle and the clustering vine Delight no more, for joy no more is mine. My flocks no longer find a master's care; Ev'n piteous as they gaze with looks of dumb despair. Then go, &amp;c. Thy hazel, Tyt'rus, has no charms for me; Nor yet thy wild ash, lov'd Alphesibee. No more shall fancy weave her rural dream, By Ægan's willow, or Amynta's stream, The trembling leaves, the fountain's cool serene, The murmuring zephyr, and the mossy green— These smile unseen, and those unheeded play, I cut my shrubs, and careless walk'd away. Then go, &amp;c. Mopsus, who knows what fates the stars dispense, And solves the grove's wild warblings into sense, Thus Mopsus mark'd—what thus thy spleen can move? Some baleful planet, or some hopeless love? The star of Saturn oft annoys the swain, And in the dull cold breast long holds his leaden reign. Then go, &amp;c. The nymphs too, piteous of their shepherd's woe, Came the sad cause solicitous to know. Is this the port of jocund youth, they cry, That look disgusted, and that downcast eye? Gay smiles and love on that soft season wait; Milton seems to have borrowed this sentiment from Guarini. Che se t'assale a la canuta etate Amoroso talento, Havrai doppio tormento, E di quel, che potendo non volesti, E di quel, che volendo non potrai. He's twice a wretch whom beauty wounds too late. Then go, &amp;c. One gentle tear the British Chloris gave, Chloris the grace of Maldon's purple wave— In vain—my grief no soothing words disarm, No future hopes, nor present good can charm. Then go, &amp;c. The happier flocks one social spirit moves, The same their sports, their pastures and their loves; Their hearts to no peculiar object tend, None knows a favo'rite, or selects a friend. So herd the various natives of the main, And Proteus drives in crowds his scaly train; The feather'd tribes too find an easier fate, The meanest sparrow still enjoys his mate; And when by chance or wearing age she dies, The transient loss a second choice supplies. Man, hapless man, for ever doom'd to know The dire vexations that from discord flow, In all the countless numbers of his kind, Can scarcely meet with one congenial mind; If haply found, death wings the fatal dart, The tender union breaks, and breaks his heart. Then go, &amp;c. Ah me! what error tempted me to go O'er foreign mountains, and thro' Alpine snow? Too great the price to mark in Tyber's gloom The mournful image of departed Rome! Nay, yet immortal, could she boast again The glories of her universal reign. And all that Maro left his fields to see, Too great the purchase to abandon thee! To leave thee in a land no longer seen!— Bid mountains rise, and oceans roll between!— Ah! not embrace thee!—not to see thee die! Meet thy last looks, or close thy languid eye! Not one fond farewell with thy shade to send, Nor bid thee think of thy surviving friend! Then go, &amp;c. Ye Tuscan shepherds, pardon me this tear! Dear to the muse, to me for ever dear! The youth I mourn a Tuscan title bore— See The Tuscans were a branch of the Pelasgi that migrated into Europe, not many ages after the dispersion. Some of them marched by land as far as Lydia, and from thence detached a colony under the conduct of Tyrsenus to Italy. Lydian Lucca for her son deplore! O days of ecstacy! when wrapt I lay Where Arno wanders down his flow'ry way,— Pluck'd the pale violet, press'd the velvet mead, Or bade the myrtle's balmy fragrance bleed!— Delighted, heard amid the rural throng, Menalcas strive with Lycidas in song. Oft would my voice the mimic strain essay, Nor haply all unheeded was my lay: For, shepherds, yet I boast your gen'rous meed, The osier basket, and compacted reed: Francino crown'd me with a poet's fame, And Dati When Milton was in Italy, Carlo Dati was professor of philosophy at Florence—a liberal friend to men of genius and learning, as well foreigners as his own countrymen. He wrote a panegyric and some poems on Lewis XIV. besides other tracts. taught his beechen groves my name. TO THE REV. MR. LAMB. Lamb, could the muse that boasts thy forming care, Unfold the grateful feelings of my heart, Her hand for thee should many a wreath prepare, And cull the choicest flowers with studious art. For mark'd by thee was each imperfect ray That haply wander'd o'er my infant mind; The dawn of genius brighten'd into day, As thy skill open'd, as thy lore refin'd. Each uncouth lay that faulter'd from my tongue, At eve or morn from Eden's murmurs caught; Whate'er I painted, and whate'er I sung, Tho' rude the strain, tho' artless was the draught; You wisely prais'd, and fed the sacred fire, That warms the breast with love and honest fame; You swell'd to nobler heights the infant lyre, Rais'd the low thought, and check'd th' exuberant flame. O could the muse in future times obtain One humble garland from th' Aonian tree! With joy I'd bind thy favour'd brows again, With joy I'd form a fairer wreath for thee. EPISTLE TO MR.? From scenes where fancy no excursion tries, Nor trusts her wing to smoke-invelop'd skies; Far from the town's detested haunts remov'd, And nought but thee deserted that I lov'd; From noise and folly and the world got free, One truant thought yet only stays for thee. What is that world which makes the heart its slave? A restless sea, revolving wave on wave: There rage the storms of each uncertain clime; There float the wrecks of Fortune and of Time: There Hope's smooth gales in soft succession blow, While disappointment hides the rock below. The syren pleasures tune their fatal breath, And lull you to the long repose of death. What is that world? ah!—'tis no more Than the vext ocean while we walk the shore. Loud roar the winds and swell the wild waves high, Lash the rude beach, and frighten all the sky; No longer shall my little bark be rent, Since Hope resign'd her anchor to Content. Like some poor fisher that, escap'd with life, Will trust no more to elemental strife; But sits in safety on the green-bank side, And lives upon the leavings of the tide; Like him contented you your friend shall see, As safe, as happy, and as poor as he. TO A LADY, ON READING AN ELEGY WRITTEN BY HER ON THE SEARCH OF HAPPINESS. To seek the lovely nymph you sing, I've wander'd many a weary mile, From grove to grove, from spring to spring; If here or there she deign'd to smile. Nay, what I now must blush to say, For sure it hap'd in evil hour; I once so far mistook my way, To seek her in the haunts of power. How should success my search betide, When still so far I wander'd wrong? For happiness on Arrowe's side, Was list'ning to Maria's song. Delighted thus with you to stay, What hope have I the nymph to see; Unless you cease your magic lay, Or bring her in your arms to me? TO ALMENA. FROM THE BANKS OF THE IRWAN. Where trembling poplars shade their parent vale, And tune to melody the mountain gale; Where Irwan murmurs musically slow, And breathing breezes through his osiers blow; Friend of my heart, behold thy poet laid In the dear silence of his native shade! Ye sacred vales, where oft the muse, unseen, Led my light steps along the moon-light green; Ye scenes, where peace and fancy held their reign, For ever lov'd, and once enjoy'd again! Ah! where is now, that nameless bliss refin'd; That tranquil hour, that vacancy of mind? As sweet the wild rose bears its balmy breast; As soon, the breeze with murmurs sooths to rest; As smooth, the stream of silver Irwan flows; As fair, each flower along his border blows: Yet dwells not here that nameless bliss refin'd, That tranquil hour, that vacancy of mind. Is it that knowledge is allied to woe; And are we happy, only e'er we know? Is it that Hope withholds her golden ray, That Fancy's fairy visions fade away? Or can I, distant far from all that's dear, Be happy only when Almena's near? That truth, the feelings of my heart disclose: Too dear the friendship for the friend's repose. Thus mourn'd the muse, when thro' his osiers wild, The hill-born Irwan rais'd his head and smil'd: “Child of my hopes,” he fondly cried, “forbear; “Nor let thy Irwan witness thy despair. “Has peace indeed forsook my flow'ry shore? “Shall Fame, and Hope, and Fancy charm no more? “Tho' Fame and Hope in kindred air depart, “Yet Eancy still should hold thee to her heart; “For, at thy birth, the village hind has seen “Her light wings waving o'er the shadowy green. “With rosy wreaths she crown'd the new-born hours, “And rival fairies fill'd thy bed with flowers; “In vain—if grief shall waste thy blooming years, “And life dissolve in solitude and tears.”— TO GEORGE COLMAN, ESQ. PREFIXED TO THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THEODOSIUS AND CONSTANTIA. To live beneath the golden star of love, With happier fancy, passions more refin'd, Each soft'ning charm of tenderness to prove, And all the finer movements of the mind— From gifts like these say, what the boasted gain Of those who exquisitely feel or know? The skill from pleasure to extract the pain, And open all the avenues of woe. Yet shall we, Colman, at these gifts repine? Implore cold apathy to steel the heart? Would you that sensibility resign, And with those powers of genius would you part? Ah me! my friend! nor deem the verse divine That weakness wrote in Petrarch's gentle strain! When once he own'd at love's unfav'ring shrine, “A thousand pleasures were not worth one pain.” The dreams of fancy sooth the pensive heart; For fancy's urn can new delights dispense: The powers of genius purer joys impart; For genius brightens all the springs of sense. O charm of every muse-ennobl'd mind, Far, far above the groveling crowd to rise!— Leave the low train of trifling cares behind, Assert its birthright, and affect the skies! O right divine, the pride of power to scorn! On fortune's little vanity look down! With nobler gifts, to fairer honours born, Than fear, or folly, fancies in a crown! As far each boon that Nature's hand bestows, The worthless glare of fortune's train exceeds, As yon fair orb, whose beam eternal glows, Outshines the transient meteor that it feeds. To Nature, Colman, let thy incense rise, For, much indebted, much hast thou to pay; For taste refin'd, for wit correctly wise, And keen discernment's soul-pervading ray. To catch the manners from the various face, To paint the nice diversities of mind, The living lines of character to trace, She gave thee powers, and the task assign'd. Seize, seize the pen! the sacred hour departs! Nor, led by kindness, longer lend thine ear: The tender tale of two ingenuous hearts Would rob thee of a moment and a tear. AN ODE TO THE GENIUS OF WESTMORELAND. Hail, hidden power of these wild groves, These uncouth rocks, and mountains grey! Where oft, as fades the closing day, The family of Fancy roves. In what lone cave, what sacred cell, Coæval with the birth of Time, Wrapt in high cares, and thought sublime, In awful silence dost thou dwell? Oft in the depth of winter's reign, As blew the bleak winds o'er the dale; Moaning along the distant gale, Has Fancy heard thy voice complain. Oft in the dark wood's lonely way, Swift has she seen thee glancing by; Or down the summer evening sky, Sporting in clouds of gilded day. If caught from thee the sacred fire, That glow'd within my youthful breast; Those thoughts too high to be exprest, Genius, if thou didst once inspire, O pleas'd accept this votive lay, That, in my native shades retir'd, And once, once more by thee inspir'd, In gratitude I pay. HYMN TO HOPE. ????? ???????? ????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ????? ??????? Hes. WRITTEN IN 1761. I. Sun of the soul! whose chearful ray Darts o'er this gloom of life a smile; Sweet Hope, yet further gild my way, Yet light my weary steps awhile, Till thy fair lamp dissolve in endless day. II. O come with such an eye and mien, As when by amorous shepherd seen; While in the violet-breathing vale He meditates his evening tale! Nor leave behind thy fairy train, Repose, Belief, and Fancy vain; That towering on her wing sublime, Outstrips the lazy flight of time, Riots on distant days with thee, And opens all futurity. III. O come! and to my pensive eye Thy far-foreseeing tube apply, Whose kind deception steals us o'er The gloomy waste that lies before; Still opening to the distant sight The sunshine of the mountain's height; Where scenes of fairer aspect rise, Elysian groves, and azure skies. IV. Nor, gentle Hope, forget to bring The family of Youth and Spring; The Hours that glide in sprightly round, The Mountain-Nymphs with wild thyme crown'd; Delight that dwells with raptur'd eye On stream, or flower, or field, or sky: And foremost in thy train advance The Loves and Joys in jovial dance; Nor last be Expectation seen, That wears a wreath of ever-green. V. Attended thus by Beleau's streams, Oft hast thou sooth'd my waking dreams, When, prone beneath an osier shade, At large my vacant limbs were laid; To thee and Fancy all resign'd, What visions wander'd o'er my mind! Illusions dear, adieu! no more Shall I your fairy haunts explore; For Hope withholds her golden ray, And Fancy's colours faint away. To Eden's shores, to Enon's groves, Resounding once with Delia's loves, Adieu! that name shall sound no more O'er Enon's groves or Eden's shore: For Hope withholds her golden ray, And Fancy's colours faint away. VI. Life's ocean slept,—the liquid gale Gently mov'd the waving sail. Fallacious Hope! with flattering eye You smil'd to see the streamers fly. The thunder bursts, the mad wind raves, From slumber wake the 'frighted waves: You saw me, fled me thus distrest, And tore your anchor from my breast. VII. Yet come, fair fugitive, again! I love thee still, though false and vain. Forgive me, gentle Hope, and tell Where, far from me, you deign to dwell. To sooth Ambition's wild desires; To feed the lover's eager fires; To swell the miser's mouldy store; To gild the dreaming chymist's ore; Are these thy cares? or more humane, To loose the war-worn captive's chain, And bring before his languid sight The charms of liberty and light: The tears of drooping Grief to dry; And hold thy glass to Sorrow's eye? VIII. Or do'st thou more delight to dwell With Silence in the hermit's cell? To teach Devotion's flame to rise, And wing her vespers to the skies; To urge, with still returning care, The holy violence of prayer; In rapt'rous visions to display The realms of everlasting day, And snatch from Time the golden key, That opens all eternity? IX. Perchance, on some unpeopled strand, Whose rocks the raging tide withstand, Thy soothing smile, in desarts drear, A lonely mariner may chear, Who bravely holds his feeble breath, Attack'd by Famine, Pain, and Death. With thee, he bears each tedious day Along the dreary beach to stray. Whence their wide way his toil'd eyes strain O'er the blue bosom of the main; And meet, where distant surges rave, A white sail in each foaming wave. X. Doom'd from each native joy to part, Each dear connection of the heart, You the poor exile's steps attend, The only undeserting friend. You wing the slow-declining year; You dry the solitary tear; And oft, with pious guile, restore Those scenes he must behold no more. XI. O most ador'd of earth or skies! To thee ten thousand temples rise; By age retain'd, by youth carest, The same dear idol of the breast. Depriv'd of thee, the wretch were poor That rolls in heaps of Lydian ore: With thee the simple hind is gay, Whose toil supports the passing day. XII. The rose-lip'd Loves that, round their queen, Dance o'er Cythera's smiling green, Thy aid implore, thy power display In many a sweetly-warbled lay. For ever in thy sacred shrine, Their unextinguish'd torches shine; Idalian flowers their sweets diffuse, And myrtles shed their balmy dews. Ah! still propitious, may'st thou deign To sooth an anxious lover's pain! By thee deserted, well I know, His heart would feel no common woe. His gentle prayer propitious hear, And stop the frequent-falling tear. XIII. For me, fair Hope, if once again Perchance, to smile on me you deign, Be such your sweetly-rural air, And such a graceful visage wear, As when, with Truth and young Desire, You wak'd the lord of Hagley's lyre; And painted to her Poet's mind, The charms of Lucy, fair and kind. XIV. But ah! too early lost!—then go, Vain Hope, thou harbinger of woe. Ah! no;—that thought distracts my heart: Indulge me, Hope, we must not part. Direct the future as you please; But give me, give me present ease. XV. Sun of the soul! whose chearful ray Darts o'er this gloom of life a smile; Sweet Hope, yet further gild my way, Yet light my weary steps awhile, Till thy fair lamp dissolve in endless day. HYMN TO PLUTUS. Great god of wealth, before whose sacred throne Truth, honour, genius, fame, and worth lie prone! To thy throng'd temples take one vot'ry more: To thee a poet never kneel'd before. Adieu the gods that caught my early prayer! Wisdom that frown'd, and Knowledge fraught with care Friendship that every veering gale could move! And tantalizing Hope, and faithless Love! These, these are slaves that in thy liv'ry shine: For Wisdom, Friendship, Love himself is thine! For thee I'll labour down the mine's dark way, And leave the confines of enliv'ning day; For thee Asturia's shining sands explore, And bear the splendours of Potosi's ore; Scale the high rock, and tempt the raging sea, And think, and toil, and wish, and wake for thee. Farewell the scenes that thoughtless youth could please; The flow'ry scenes of indolence and ease. Where you the way with magic power beguile, Bassora's deep, or Lybia's deserts smile. Foes of thy worth, that, insolent and vain, Deride thy maxims, and reject thy reign, The frantic tribe of virtue shall depart, And make no more their ravage in my heart. Away “The tears that pity taught to flow!” Away that anguish for a brother's woe! Adieu to these, and ev'ry tiresome guest, That drain'd my fortunes, or destroy'd my rest! Ah, good Avaro! could I thee despise? Thee, good Avaro; provident and wise? Plutus, forgive the bitter things I've said! I love Avaro; poor Avaro's dead. Yet, yet I'm thine; for Fame's unerring tongue In thy sooth'd ear thus pours her silver song. “Immortal Plutus! god of golden ease! “Form'd ev'ry heart, and ev'ry eye to please! “For thee Content her downy carpet spreads, “And rosy Pleasure swells her genial beds. “'Tis thine to gild the mansions of Despair, “And beam a glory round the brows of Care; “To cheat the lazy pace of sleepless hours “With marble fountains, and ambrosial bowers.” O grant me, Plutus, scenes like those I sung, My youthful lyre when vernal fancy strung. For me their shades let other Studleys rear, Tho' each tree's water'd with a widow's tear. Detested god!—forgive me! I adore. Great Plutus, grant me one petition more. Should Delia, tender, gen'rous, fair and free, Leave love and truth, and sacrifice to thee, I charge thee, Plutus, be to Delia kind, And make her fortunes richer than her mind. Be her's the wealth all heaven's broad eye can view; Grant her, good god, Don Philip and Peru. HYMN TO HUMANITY. Parent of Virtue, if thine ear Attend not now to Sorrow's cry; If now the pity-streaming tear Should haply on thy cheek be dry; Indulge my votive strain, O sweet Humanity. Come, ever welcome to my breast, A tender, but a cheerful guest; Nor always in the gloomy cell Of life-consuming sorrow dwell; For Sorrow, long-indulg'd and slow, Is to Humanity a foe; And Grief, that makes the heart its prey, Wears Sensibility away. Then comes, sweet nymph, instead of thee, The gloomy fiend Stupidity. O may that fiend be banish'd far, Though passions hold eternal war! Nor ever let me cease to know The pulse that throbs at joy or woe. Nor let my vacant cheek be dry, When sorrow fills a brother's eye; Nor may the tear that frequent flows From private or from social woes, E'er make this pleasing sense depart, Ye cares, O harden not my heart. If the fair star of fortune smile, Let not its flatt'ring power beguile: Nor borne along the fav'ring tide, My full sails swell with bloating pride. Let me from wealth but hope content, Rememb'ring still it was but lent; To modest merit spread my store; Unbar my hospitable door! Nor feed, for pomp, an idle train, While Want unpity'd pines in vain. If Heav'n, in ev'ry purpose wise, The envy'd lot of wealth denies; If doom'd to drag life's painful load Thro' Poverty's uneven road, And, for the due bread of the day, Destin'd to toil as well as pray; To thee, Humanity, still true, I'll wish the good I cannot do; And give the wretch that passes by, A soothing word—a tear—a sigh. Howe'er exalted, or deprest, Be ever mine the feeling breast. From me remove the stagnant mind Of languid indolence, reclin'd; The soul that one long Sabbath keeps, And thro' the sun's whole circle sleeps; Dull Peace, that dwells in Folly's eye, And self-attending Vanity. Alike, the foolish, and the vain Are strangers to the sense humane. O, for that sympathetic glow Which taught the holy tear to flow, When the prophetic eye survey'd Sion in future ashes laid; Or, rais'd to Heav'n, implor'd the bread That thousands in the desert fed! Or when the heart o'er Friendship's grave Sigh'd,—and forgot its power to save— O, for that sympathetic glow, Which taught the holy tear to flow! It comes: it fills my labouring breast! I feel my beating heart opprest. Oh! hear that lonely widow's wail! See her dim eye! her aspect pale! To Heav'n she turns in deep despair, Her infants wonder at her prayer, And, mingling tears they know not why, Lift up their little hands and cry. O God! their moving sorrows see! Support them, sweet Humanity. Life, fill'd with grief's distressful train, For ever asks the tear humane. Behold in yon unconscious grove The victims of ill-fated love! Heard you that agonizing throe? Sure this is not romantic woe! The golden day of joy is o'er; And now they part—to meet no more. Assist them, hearts from anguish free! Assist them, sweet Humanity. Parent of Virtue, if thine ear Attend not now to Sorrow's cry; If now the pity-streaming tear Should haply on thy cheek be dry, Indulge my votive strain, O sweet Humanity. HYMN TO THE RISING SUN. From the red wave rising bright, Lift on high thy golden head; O'er the misty mountains, spread Thy smiling rays of orient light! See the golden god appear; Flies the fiend of darkness drear; Flies, and in her gloomy train, Sable Grief, and Care, and Pain! See the golden god advance! On Taurus' heights his coursers prance: With him haste the vernal hours, Breathing sweets, and drooping flowers. Laughing Summer at his side, Waves her locks in rosy pride; And Autumn bland with aspect kind, Bears his golden sheaf behind. O haste, and spread the purple day O'er all the wide ethereal way! Nature mourns at thy delay: God of glory, haste away! From the red wave rising bright, Lift on high thy golden head; O'er the misty mountains, spread Thy smiling rays of orient light! A FAREWELL HYMN TO THE VALLEY OF IRWAN. Farewell the fields of Irwan's vale, My infant years where Fancy led; And sooth'd me with the western gale, Her wild dreams waving round my head, While the blythe blackbird told his tale. Farewell the fields of Irwan's vale! The primrose on the valley's side, The green thyme on the mountain's head, The wanton rose, the daisy pied, The wilding's blossom blushing red; No longer I their sweets inhale. Farewell the fields of Irwan's vale! How oft, within yon vacant shade, Has ev'ning clos'd my careless eye! How oft, along those bands, I've stray'd, And watch'd the wave that wander'd by! Full long their loss shall I bewail. Farewell the fields of Irwan's vale! Yet still, within yon vacant grove, To mark the close of parting day; Along yon flow'ry banks to rove, And watch the wave that winds away; Fair Fancy sure shall never fail, Tho' far from these, and Irwan's vale! HYMN TO THE ETERNAL PROVIDENCE. Life of the world, Immortal Mind; Father of all the human kind! Whose boundless eye that knows no rest, Intent on Nature's ample breast; Explores the space of earth and skies, And sees eternal incense rise! To thee my humble voice I raise; Forgive, while I presume to praise. Tho' thou this transient being gave, That shortly sinks into the grave; Yet 'twas thy goodness, still to give A being that can think and live; In all thy works thy wisdom see, And stretch its tow'ring mind to thee. To thee my humble voice I raise; Forgive, while I presume to praise. And still this poor contracted span, This life, that bears the name of Man; From thee derives its vital ray, Eternal Source of life and day! Thy bounty still the sunshine pours, That gilds its morn and ev'ning hours, To thee my humble voice I raise; Forgive, while I presume to praise. Thro' Error's maze, thro' Folly's night, The lamp of Reason lends me light. When stern Affliction waves her rod, My heart confides in thee, my God! When Nature shrinks, oppress'd with woes, E'en then she finds in thee repose. To thee my humble voice I raise; Forgive, while I presume to praise. Affliction flies, and Hope returns; Her lamp with brighter splendour burns; Gay Love with all his smiling train, And Peace and Joy are here again. These, these, I know, 'twas thine to give; I trusted; and, behold, I live! To thee my humble voice I raise; Forgive, while I presume to praise. O may I still thy favour prove! Still grant me gratitude and love. Let truth and virtue guide my heart; Nor peace, nor hope, nor joy depart; But yet, whate'er my life may be, My heart shall still repose on thee! To thee my humble voice I raise! Forgive, while I presume to praise. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATIONS. THE DEATH OF ADONIS. FROM THE GREEK OF BION. Bion, the pastoral poet, lived in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus. By the epithet ?????????, every where applied to him, it is probable that he was born at Smyrna. Moschus confirms this, when he says to the river Meles, which had before wept for Homer, ???? ????? ????? ???? ????????? It is evident, however, that he spent much of his time in Sicily. Moschus, as he tells us, was his scholar; and by him we are informed, that his master was not a poor poet. “Thou hast left to others thy riches,” says he, “but to me thy poetry.” It appears from the same author, that he died by poison. The best edition of his works, is that of Paris, by M.de Longe-Pierre, with a French translation. 1759. Adonis dead, the muse of woe shall mourn; Adonis dead, the weeping Loves return. The Queen of Beauty o'er his tomb shall shed Her flowing sorrows for Adonis dead; For earth's cold lap her velvet couch forego, And robes of purple for the weeds of woe. Adonis, the favourite of Venus, was the son of Cynaras, king of Cyprus. His chief employment was hunting, though he is represented by Virgil as a shepherd, “Oves ad flumina pavit Adonis.” He was killed by a wild boar, if we may believe Propertius, in Cyprus. ?“Percussit Adonim “Venantem idalio vertice durus Aper.” The anniversary of his death was celebrated through the whole Pagan world. Aristophanes, in his Comedy of Peace, reckons the feast of Adonis among the chief festivals of the Athenians. The Syrians observed it with all the violence of grief, and the greatest cruelty of self-castigation. It was celebrated at Alexandria in St. Cyril's time; and when Julian the apostate made his entry at Antioch, in the year 362, they were celebrating the feast of Adonis. The ancients differ greatly in their accounts of this divinity. Athenæus says, that he was the favourite of Bacchus. Plutarch maintains, that he and Bacchus are the same, and that the Jews abstained from swine's flesh because Adonis was killed by a boar. Ausonius, Epig.30, affirms that Bacchus, Osiris, and Adonis, are one and the same. Adonis dead, the muse of woe shall mourn; Adonis dead, the weeping Loves return. Stretch'd on this mountain thy torn lover lies. Weep, Queen of Beauty! for he bleeds—he dies. Ah! yet behold life's last drops faintly flow, In streams of purple, o'er those limbs of snow! From the pale cheek the perish'd roses fly; And death dims slow the ghastly-gazing eye. Kiss, kiss those fading lips, ere chill'd in death; With soothing fondness stay the fleeting breath. 'Tis vain—ah! give the soothing fondness o'er! Adonis feels the warm salute no more. Adonis dead, the muse of woe shall mourn; Adonis dead, the weeping Loves return. The lines in the original run thus: ?????? ?????? ????? ???? ???? ????? ??????. ?????? ?? ? ???????? ????? ???? ??????? ?????. ?????? ??? ???? ????? ????? ????? ????????, ??? ?????? ????????? ????????. The two first of these lines contain a kind of witticism, which it was better to avoid—This author had, however, too much true genius to be fond of these little affected turns of expression, which Musæus and others have been industrious to strike out. These four verses are transposed in the translation for the sake of the connection. His faithful dogs bewail their master slain, And mourning dryads pour the plaintive strain. Not the fair youth alone the wound opprest, The Queen of Beauty bears it in her breast. Her feet unsandal'd, floating wild her hair, Her aspect woeful, and her bosom bare, This image of the sorrow of Venus is very affecting, and is introduced in this place with great beauty and propriety. Indeed, most modern poets seem to have observed it, and have profited by it in their scenes of elegiac woe. Distrest, she wanders the wild wastes forlorn, Her sacred limbs by ruthless brambles torn. Loud as she grieves, surrounding rocks complain, And echo thro' the long vales calls her absent swain. Adonis hears not: life's last drops fall slow, In streams of purple, down his limbs of snow. The weeping Cupids round their queen deplore, And mourn her beauty, and her love no more. Each rival grace, that glow'd with conscious pride, Each charm of Venus with Adonis dy'd. Adonis dead, the vocal hills bemoan, And hollow groves return the sadd'ning groan. When the poet makes the rivers mourn for Venus, he very properly calls her ????????; but this propriety perhaps was merely accidental, as he has given her the same appellation when she wanders the desart. The swelling floods with sea-born Venus weep, And roll in mournful murmurs to the deep: In melting tears the mountain-springs comply; ????? ?? ?? ?????? ????????????.? Paleness being the known effect of grief, we do not at first sight accept this expression; but when we consider that the first emotions of it are attended with blushes, we are pleased with the observation. The flowers, low-drooping, blush with grief, and die. ? ?? ?????? ?????? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ?????? ??????? ??????. This passage the scholiasts have entirely misunderstood. They make ?????? Venus, for which they have neither any authority, the Doric name she borrows from that island being always ????????, nor the least probability from the connection. This proves that the island Cythera was the place where Adonis perished, notwithstanding the opinion of Propertius and others to the contrary. Cythera's groves with strains of sorrow ring; The dirge funereal her sad cities sing. Hark! pitying echoes Venus' sighs return; When Venus sighs, can aught forbear to mourn? But when she saw her fainting lover lie, The wide wound gaping on the with'ring thigh; But streaming when she saw life's purple tide, Stretch'd her fair arms, with trembling voice she cry'd: Yet stay, lov'd youth! a moment ere we part, O let me kiss thee!—hold thee to my heart! A little moment, dear Adonis! stay! And kiss thy Venus, ere those lips are clay. Let those dear lips by mine once more be prest, 'Till thy last breath expire into my breast; Then, when life's ebbing pulse scarce, scarce can move, I'll catch thy soul, and drink thy dying love. That last-left pledge shall sooth my tortur'd breast, When thou art gone— When, far from me, thy gentle ghost explores Infernal Pluto's grimly-glooming shores. Wretch that I am! immortal and divine, In life imprison'd whom the fates confine. He comes! receive him to thine iron-arms; Blest Queen of Death! receive the Prince of Charms. Far happier thou, to whose wide realms repair Whatever lovely, and whatever fair. The smiles of joy, the golden hours are fled: Grief, only grief, survives Adonis dead. The loves around in idle sorrows stand, And the dim torch falls from the vacant hand. Hence the vain zone! the myrtle's flow'ry pride! Delight and beauty with Adonis died. Why didst thou, vent'rous, the wild chace explore, From his dark lair to rouze the tusky boar? Far other sport might those fair limbs essay, Than the rude combat, or the savage fray. Thus Venus griev'd—the Cupids round deplore; And mourn her beauty, and her love no more. Now flowing tears in silent grief complain, Mix with the purple streams, and flood the plain. Yet not in vain those sacred drops shall flow, The purple streams in blushing roses glow: And catching life from ev'ry falling tear, Their azure heads anemonies shall rear. But cease in vain to cherish dire despair, Nor mourn unpitied to the mountain-air; The last sad office let thy hand supply, Stretch the stiff limbs, and close the glaring eye. That form repos'd beneath the bridal vest, May cheat thy sorrows with the feint of rest. For lovely smile those lips, tho' void of breath, And fair those features in the shade of death. Haste, fill with flowers, with rosy wreathes his bed. Perish the flowers! the Prince of Beauty's dead. Round the pale corse each breathing essence strew, Let weeping myrtles pour their balmy dew. Perish the balms, unable to restore Those vital sweets of love that charm no more! 'Tis done.—Behold, with purple robes array'd, In mournful state the clay-cold limbs are laid. The Loves lament with all the rage of woe, Stamp on the dart, and break the useless bow. Officious these the wat'ry urn supply, Unbind the buskin'd leg, and wash the bleeding thigh. O'er the pale body those their light wings wave, As yet, tho' vain, solicitous to save. All, wild with grief, their hapless queen deplore, And mourn her beauty, and her love no more. Dejected Hymen droops his head forlorn, His torch extinct, and flow'ry tresses torn: For nuptial airs, and songs of joy, remain The sad, slow dirge, the sorrow-breathing strain. Who wou'd not, when Adonis dies, deplore? Who wou'd not weep when Hymen smiles no more? The graces mourn the Prince of Beauty slain, Loud as Dione on her native main: The fates relenting join the general woe, And call the lover from the realms below. Vain, hopeless grief! can living sounds pervade The dark, dead regions of eternal shade? Spare, Venus, spare that too luxuriant tear Numa seems to have borrowed the custom he instituted of mourning a year for the deceased from the Greeks. For though it is said only ten months were set apart, yet ten months were the year of Romulus till regulated by his successor. For the long sorrows of the mournful year. THE HAPPINESS OF A MODERATE FORTUNE AND MODERATE DESIRES. FROM THE FRENCH OF MR. GRESSET. WRITTEN IN 1760. O goddess of the golden mean, Whom still misjudging folly flies, Seduc'd by each delusive scene; Thy only subjects are the wise. These seek thy paths with nobler aim, And trace them to the gates of fame. See foster'd in thy fav'ring shade, Each tender bard of verse divine! Who, lur'd by fortune's vain parade, Had never form'd the tuneful line; By fortune lur'd or want confin'd, Whose cold hand chills the genial mind. In vain you slight the flow'ry crown, That fame wreathes round the favour'd head! Whilst laurell'd victory and renown Their heroes from thy shades have led; There form'd, from courtly softness free, By rigid virtue and by thee. By thee were form'd, from cities far, Fabricius just, Camillus wise, Those philosophic sons of war, That from imperial dignities Returning, plough'd their native plain, And plac'd their laurels in thy fane. Thrice happy he, on whose calm breast The smiles of peaceful wisdom play, With all thy sober charms possest, Whose wishes never learnt to stray. Whom truth, of pleasures pure but grave, And pensive thoughts from folly save. Far from the crowd's low-thoughted strife, From all that bounds fair freedom's aim, He envies not the pomp of life, A length of rent-roll, or of name: For safe he views the vale-grown elm, While thunder-sounding storms the mountain pine o'erwhelm. Of censure's frown he feels no dread, No fear he knows of vulgar eyes, Whose thought, to nobler objects led, Far, far o'er their horizon flies: With Reason's suffrage at his side, Whose firm heart rests self-satisfied. And while alternate conquest sways The northern, or the southern shore, He smiles at Fortune's giddy maze, And calmly hears the wild storm roar. Ev'n Nature's groans, unmov'd with fear, And bursting worlds he'd calmly hear. Such are the faithful hearts you love, O Friendship fair, immortal maid; The few caprice could never move, The few whom int'rest never sway'd; Nor shed unseen, with hate refin'd, The pale cares o'er the gloomy mind. Soft sleep, that lov'st the peaceful cell, On these descends thy balmy power; While no terrific dreams dispel The slumbers of the sober hour; Which oft, array'd in darkness drear, Wake the wild eye of pride to fear. Content with all a farm would yield, Thus Sidon's monarch liv'd unknown, And sigh'd to leave his little field, For the long glories of a throne— There once more happy and more free, Than rank'd with Dido's ancestry. With these pacific virtues blest, These charms of philosophic ease, Wrapt in your Richmond's tranquil rest, You pass, dear C?, your useful days. Where Thames your silent vallies laves, Proud of his yet untainted waves. Should life's more public scenes engage Your time that thus consistent flows, And following still these maxims sage For ever brings the same repose; Your worth may greater fame procure, But hope not happiness so pure. TRANSLATIONS FROM PETRARCH. 1765. SONNET CLXXIX. Tho' nobly born, to humble life resign'd; The purest heart, the most enlighten'd mind; A vernal flower that bears the fruits of age! A chearful spirit, with an aspect sage,— The power that rules the planetary train To her has given, nor shall his gifts be vain. But on her worth, her various praise to dwell, The truth, the merits of her life to tell, The Muse herself would own the task too hard, Too great the labour for the happiest bard. Dress that derives from native beauty grace, And love that holds with honesty his place; Action that speaks—and eyes whose piercing ray Might kindle darkness, or obscure the day! SONNET CCLXXIX. Fall'n the fair column, blasted is the bay, That shaded once my solitary shore! I've lost what hope can never give me more, Tho' sought from Indus to the closing day. My twofold treasure death has snatch'd away, My pride, my pleasure left me to deplore; What fields far-cultur'd, nor imperial sway, Nor orient gold, nor jewels can restore. O destiny severe of human kind! What portion have we unbedew'd with tears? The downcast visage, and the pensive mind Thro' the thin veil of smiling life appears; And in one moment vanish into wind The hard-earn'd fruits of long, laborious years. SONNET CCLVII. Where is that face, whose slightest air could move My trembling heart, and strike the springs of love? That Heaven, where two fair stars, with genial ray, Shed their kind influence on my life's dim way? Where are that science, sense and worth confest, That speech by virtue, by the graces drest? Where are those beauties, where those charms combin'd, That caus'd this long captivity of mind? Where the dear shade of all that once was fair, The source, the solace of each amorous care; My heart's sole sovereign, Nature's only boast? —Lost to the world, to me for ever lost! SONNET CCXXXVIII. Wail'd the sweet warbler to the lonely shade; Trembled the green leaf to the summer gale; Fell the fair stream in murmurs down the dale, Its banks, its flow'ry banks with verdure spread, Where, by the charm of pensive Fancy led, All as I fram'd the love-lamenting tale, Came the dear object whom I still bewail, Came from the regions of the chearless dead: And why, she cried, untimely wilt thou die? Ah why, for pity, shall those mournful tears, Start in wild sorrow from that languid eye? Cherish no more those visionary fears, For me, who range yon light-invested sky! For me, who triumph in eternal years! MILTON'S ITALIAN POEMS TRANSLATED, AND ADDRESSED TO A GENTLEMAN OF ITALY. ADDRESS. TO SIGNOR MOZZI, OF MACERATA. To thee, the child of classic plains, The happier hand of Nature gave Each grace of Fancy's finer strains, Each Muse that mourn'd o'er Maro's grave. Nor yet the harp that Horace strung With many a charm of easy art; Nor yet what sweet Tibullus sung, When beauty bound him to her heart; Nor all that gentle Provence knew, Where each breeze bore a lover's sigh, When Petrarch's sweet persuasion drew The tender woe from Laura's eye. Nor aught that nobler Science seeks, What truth, what virtue must avoid, Nor aught the voice of Nature speaks, To thee unknown, or unenjoy'd? O wise beyond each weaker aim, That weds the soul to this low sphere, Fond to indulge the feeble frame, That holds awhile her prisoner here! Trust me, my friend, that soul survives, (If e'er had Muse prophetic skill) And when the fated hour arrives, That all her faculties shall fill, Fit for some nobler frame she flies, Afar to find a second birth, And, flourishing in fairer skies, Forsakes her nursery of earth. Oh! there, my Mozzi, to behold The man that mourn'd his country's wrong, When the poor exile left his fold, Hanc etiam vix Tityre duco. Virg. And feebly dragg'd his goat along! On Plato's hallow'd breast to lean, And catch that ray of heavenly fire, Which smooth'd a tyrant's sullen mien, And bade the cruel thought retire! Amid those fairy-fields to dwell Where Tasso's favour'd spirit saw What numbers none, but his could tell, What pencils none, but his could draw! And oft at eve, if eve can be Beneath the source of glory's smile, To range Elysian groves, and see That Nightly Visitant—'ere while, Who, when he left immortal choirs, To mix with Milton's kindred soul, The labours of their golden lyres Would steal, and ‘whisper whence he stole.’ Ausonian bard, from my fond ear By seas and mountains sever'd long, If, chance, these humble strains to hear, You leave your more melodious song, Whether, adventurous, you explore The wilds of Apenninus' brow, Or, musing near Loretto's Within a few miles of Macerata. shore, Smile piteous on the pilgrim's vow, The Muse's gentle offering still Your ear shall win, your love shall woo, And these spring-flowers of Milton fill The favour'd vales where first they grew. For me, depriv'd of all that's dear, Each fair, fond partner of my life, Left with a lonely oar to steer, Thro' the rude storms of mortal strife;— When Care, the felon of my days, Expands his cold and gloomy wing, His load when strong affliction lays On hope, the heart's elastic spring. For me what solace yet remains, Save the sweet Muse's tender lyre; Sooth'd by the magic of her strains, If, chance, the felon, Care, retire? Save the sweet Muse's tender lyre, For me no solace now remains! Yet shall the felon, Care, retire; Sooth'd by the magic of her strains. Blagdon-House, June 26, 1776. SON. I. [O lady fair, whose honour'd name is borne] O lady fair, whose honour'd name is borne By that soft vale where Rhyne so loves to stray, And sees the tall arch crown his wat'ry way! Sure, happy he, tho' much the Muse's scorn, Too dull to die beneath thy beauty's ray, Who never felt that spirit's charmed sway, Which gentle smiles, and gentle deeds adorn, Tho' in those smiles are all love's arrows worn, Each radiant virtue tho' those deeds display! Sure, happy he who that sweet voice should hear Mould the soft speech, or swell the tuneful strain, And, conscious that his humble vows were vain, Shut fond Attention from his closed ear; Who, piteous of himself, should timely part, Ere love had held long empire in his heart! SON. II. [As o'er yon wild hill, when the browner light] As o'er yon wild hill, when the browner light Of evening falls, the village-maiden hies To foster some fair plant with kind supplies, Some stranger plant, that, yet in tender plight, But feebly buds, ere Spring has open'd quite The soft affections of serener skies. So I, with such like gentle thought devise This stranger tongue to cultivate with care, All for the sake of lovely lady fair, And tune my lays in language little try'd By such as wont to Tamis' banks repair, Tamis' forsook for Arno's flow'ry side, So wrought love's will that ever ruleth wide SON. III. [Charles, must I say, what strange it seems to say] Charles, must I say, what strange it seems to say, This rebel heart that Love hath held as naught, Or, haply, in his cunning mazes caught, Would laugh, and let his captive steal away; This simple heart hath now become his prey. Yet hath no golden tress this lesson taught, Nor vermeil cheek that shames the rising day: Oh! no—'twas Beauty's most celestial ray, With charms divine of sov'reign sweetness fraught! The noble mien, the soul-dissolving air, The bright arch bending o'er the lucid eye, The voice that, breathing melody so rare, Might lead the toil'd moon from the middle sky! Charles, when such mischief arm'd this foreign fair, Small chance had I to hope this simple heart should fly. SON. IV. [In truth I feel my sun in those fair eyes] In truth I feel my sun in those fair eyes, So strongly strike they, like that powerful ray, Which falls with all the violence of day On Lybia's sands—and oft, as there, arise Hot wasting vapours from the source where lies My secret pain; yet, haply, those may say, Who talk love's language, these are only sighs, That the soft ardors of the soul betray. The concetti of the Italian in the conclusion of this Sonnet were so obstinate, that it seemed scarce possible to reduce them into any reputable form of translation. Such trifling liberties as the translator shall appear to have taken with these Poems, must be imputed to a desire of getting over blemishes of the same kind. SON. V. [An artless youth, who, simple in his love] An artless youth, who, simple in his love, Seem'd little hopeful from his heart to fly, To thee that heart, O lady, nor deny The votive gift, he brings; since that shall prove All change and fear and falsity above, Of manners that to gentle deeds comply, And courteous will, that never asketh why; Yet, mild as is the never wrathful dove, Firmness it hath, and fortitude to bear The wrecks of nature, or the wrongs of fate, From envy far, and low-designing care, And hopes and fears that vulgar minds await, With the sweet Muse, and sounding lyre elate, And only weak, when love had entrance there. CANZON. Gay youths and frolic damsels round me throng, And smiling say, Why, shepherd, wilt thou write Thy lays of love adventurous to recite In unknown numbers and a foreign tongue? Shepherd, if Hope hath ever wrought thee wrong, Afar from her and Fancy's fairy light Retire—So they to sport with me delight; And other shores, they say, and other streams Thy presence wait; and sweetest flowers that blow, Their ripening blooms reserve for thy fair brow, Where glory soon shall bear her brightest beams; Thus they, and yet their soothing little seems; If she, for whom I breathe the tender vow, Sing these soft lays, and ask the mutual song, This is thy language, Love, and I to thee belong!
