Duke of Norfolk. Sir Henry Norreys, Attendant on Queen Anne. Sir Francis Weston, Attendant on Queen Anne. Sir William Brereton, Attendant on Queen Anne. Sir William Kingston, Lieutenant of the Tower. Angelo Caraffa, a follower of Ignatius Loyola. Mark Smeaton. Queen Anne. Countess of Rochford. Countess of Wiltshire, Mother of Queen Anne. Magdalene Smeaton. SCENE. A small Garden near Westminster. Mark Smeaton, Magdalene Smeaton. MAGDALENE. Oh welcome, welcomeâthough I scarcely hoped That he who long hath dwelt in foreign climes, And now comes wearing the proud garb of Courts, Would waste the precious treasure of a thought On poor forgotten sister Magdalene. MARK. Still the same humble tender Magdalene, Who deems, that none can rate her modest worth More high than her retiring self. Sweet sister, I would not wound thy heaven-devoted ears With the unwonted sounds of worldly flattery; But in far distant climes, 'mid strangers' faces, That night was sweetest when I dream'd of thee, Our native garden here, our little world Of common joys and sorrows. MAGDALENE. Dearest Mark, The heart deems truth whate'er it wishes true. And wilt thou now and then steal hither to me, When thou'rt not call'd for at the Court? wilt bring Thy music, such as in the royal Chapel Thou'rt wont to sing? Rude though mine ear, it loves Thy music, brother. MARK. Dearest, yes, I'll bring All these, and hymns forbidden there; there's one Was taught me by a simple fisher boy, That sail'd the azure tide of that bright bay That laves the walls of Naples: as he sungâ What time the midnight waves were starr'd with barks, Each with its single glowworm lamp, that tipt The waters round with rippling lines of lightâ You would have thought Heaven's queen had strew'd around Silence, like that among the stars, when pause The Angels in ecstatic adoration. MAGDALENE. Speak on, speak on!âWere it a stranger's voice That thus discoursed, I could lose days in listening; But thineâ MARK. Oh! Magdalene, thou know'st not here In our chill, damp, and heavy atmosphere, The power, might, magic, mystery of sweet sounds! Oh! on some rock to sit, the twilight winds Breathing all odour byâat intervals To hear the hymnings of some virgin choir, With pauses musical as music's self, Come swelling up from deep and unseen distance: Or under some vast dome, like Heaven's blue cope, All full and living with the liquid deluge Of harmony, till pillars, walls, and aisles, The altar paintings and cold images, Catch life and motion, and the weight of feeling Lies like a load upon the breathless bosom! But speaking thus, hours will seem minutes, sister, Andâ MAGDALENE. Thou would'st say farewell. Yet ere we part I long to speak one wordâI dare not say Of counselâbut the love, whose only study Is one heart's book, gains deeper knowledge, Mark, Of its dark leaves, than schools can teach, or man Learn from his fellow men. MARK. Sage monitress! MAGDALENE. Oh! Mark, Markâin one cradle were we laid, Our souls were born together, bred together; In all thy thoughts, emotions, my fond love Anticipated thine own consciousness; I felt them, ere thyself knew thine own feelings: And never yet impetuous wish was born In that warm heart, but till fulfilment crown'd it Thou wert its slaveâits bounden, fetter'd slave. Oh! watch thyself, mistrust, fearâ MARK. What? MAGDALENE. Why all things.â In that loose Court, they say, each hard observance, Fast, penance, all the rites of holy Church, Are scoff'd; the dainty limbs are all too proud T'endure the chastening sackcloth. Sin is still Contagious: like herself are those that wait On that heretical and wicked Queen. MARK. The wicked Queen!âoh! sister, dearest sister, For the first time I'd see thy pure cheek burn With penitent tears; go kneel, and ask Heaven's pardonâ Scourge thy misjudging heartâthe wicked Queen! Heaven's living miracle of all its graces! There's not a breathing being in her presence But watches the least motion of a look, Th'unutter'd intimation of desire, And lives upon the hope of doing service, That done, is like the joy blest Angels feel In minist'ring to prayers of holiest Saints. Authority she wears as 'twere her birthright; And when our rooted knees would grow to earth In adoration, reassuring gaiety Makes the soul smile at its own fears. MAGDALENE. But, Mark, Believes she as the Church believes? MARK. I know not What she believesâI see but what she does. Loose Court, and shameless Queen!âher audience Is of the wretched, destitute, forlorn: The usher to that Court is Beggary, And Want the chamberlain; her flatterers, those Whose eloquence is full and bursting hearts; Her parasites, wan troops of starving men Round the full furnish'd boardâpale dowerless maidsâ Nuns, like thyself, cast forth from their chaste cloisters To meet the bitter usage of the world; While holiest men are ever in her presence: Nor can their lavish charity exhaust The treasures of her goodness. MAGDALENE. Oh! Mark, Markâ My only joy on earthâthat, if my soul E'er dream'd of Heaven, wert evermore a part, Th'intelligible part of its full bliss, Thou art not warp'd by pride of new opinion? MARK. Is't new t'adore the mingled consummation Of beauty, gentleness, and goodness? MAGDALENE. Cease! For this, for hearing this, I must do penanceâ Fast, weep, and pray; and, oh! beware, bewareâ The holy Father comes, whose keen eye reads The inmost soul; I've felt him pluck the thought I dared not speak from its dark sanctuary I' the heart, and cast it down before mine eyes Till my soul shuddered at its own corruption. He sees us notâstand backâ'twere ill t'intrude Upon his saintly privacy, whose soul Haply is prostrate at Our Lady's feet, In our behalf, his poor unworthy flock. Half of his life, our lady Abbess says, Is spent in Heaven, while the pale body here Pines in the absence of its nobler guest. MARK. How, Angelo! MAGDALENE. Peace, peace; seal lips and ears. [They retire. Angelo Caraffa. ANGELO CARAFFA. They cross'd me, and I needs must followâto th'Abbey; T'insult their fathers' graves; to mock the Saints That from the high empurpled windows glare On the proud worshippers, whose secret hearts Disdain their intercession; scarce a lamp Burnt on the prayerless shrines, and here and there Some wan sad votress, in Our Lady's chapel, Listening in vain for the full anthem, told Her beads, and shrunk from her own lonely voice. But when I saw the Arch-heretic enrobed In the cope and pall of mitred Canterbury, Lift the dread Host with misbelieving hands, And heard another's voice profane read out, In their own dissonant and barbarous tongue, The living word of God, the choking wrath Convulsed my throat, and hurrying forth I sought A secret and unechoing place, t'unload My burthen'd heart! 'Twas the first timeâthe last That holy Indignation hath o'erleap'd Wisdom's strong barriersâthe ill-govern'd features Play'd traitor to the close-wrapt heart. But thou That art a part of God's dread majesty, In whose dusk robe his own disastrous purposes Th'Almighty veils, twin-born with Destiny, Inexorable Secrecy! come, cowl This soul in deep impervious blackness!âGrant I may deny myself the pride and fame Of bringing back this loose apostate land To the true Faith. Be all mine agency Secret as are the springs of living fire In the world's centre, bury deep my name, That mortal eye ne'er read it, till emblazed Amid the roll of Christ's great Saints and Martyrs It shake away the oblivious gloom of ages. Angelo, Mark, Magdalene. ANGELO. Ye may approachâthe youth, or I mistake, Of whom Saavedra wrote, whose dulcet voice And skilful handling the sweet lute were famed Through Italyâmost fair report, young man, Hath been thy harbinger. MARK. Good reverend father, That men so wise, whose words are treasured counsels To mightiest Kings, should deign to note a name Like mine, moves wonder. ANGELO. Youth, thou hast a soul, For which thy spiritual guide must answer, As for a Monarch's; in her care, the Church That guards the loftiest, ne'er o'erlooks the meanest. Thou'rt new about the Court, and our good Queen, With gracious affability, will sit Listening to thy sweet languaged lute; thou'rt there In high esteem. MARK. Her Highness hath been pleased To hear me more than once, but word of praise From her had been a treasure, that my memory Had laid in store, for my whole life to brood on. ANGELO (aside). So warm!âI had forgot thy station, youth; But with the great we rank far less by birth Than estimation; and the power of ministering To their delight becomes nobility. MARK. What?âsays your wisdom so? ANGELO. Good youth, I charge thee, Cherish that modesty that well becomes thee; But yet if Fame belie thee not, thy powers May bind high-scop'd Advancement to thy serviceâ Thou may'st compete ere long withâwhich affects Her Majesty most of her servants? MARK. Each Partakes alike of that all-winning easeâ Not the proud condescension, which disdains Most manifestly when it stoops the lowestâ All are her slaves, seeming almost her equals: She's lovedâ ANGELO. Enough!âReport speaks bounteously Of Henry Norreys: he and William Brereton And Francis Weston, are about her stillâ MARK. Not one, I do believe, would deem his life Ill barter'd for her serviceâ ANGELO. And Lord Rochford, Her noble brotherâas a Poet, youth, His art is kindred to thine own, its rival In making the mute air we breathe an element Of purest intellectual joyâthe Queen To her close privacy admits. MARK. I've heard She takes delight beyond all words to hear Our harsher English tongue, by his smooth skill, And noble Surrey's, and learn'd Wyatt's, flow Melodious, as the honey-lipp'd Italian. ANGELO. 'Tis well. Thy orphan'd youth, I learn, Mark Smeaton, Wants that imperious curb Heaven delegates To parents' hands; mine order, rank, and station Give to my counsels th'impress of command: I charge thee then, by thine own soulâbewareâ Should golden honours, as belike they may, Shower on thee, wear them still with humbleness. Serve that bewitching but too easy Queen Assiduously, but still honourably. Aspire not, by whatever voice thou'rt summon'd, To perilous distinction; youth, again I say, take heedâone single day omit not, On forfeiture of my paternal care, To pour thy full confessing soul before me. MARK. What can your Wisdom mean? MAGDALENE. He means, dear brother, To merit his poor servants' prayers for thisâ Prayers that shall mount before the earliest lark, Earth's first thanksgiving voice t'indulgent Heaven. Withdraw, withdraw, he heeds no moreâaway. [Exeunt. ANGELO. That warning was a master-stroke: it brings The impossible within the scope of thought; We do forbid but what may come to pass; And he will brood on it, because forbidden, Till his whole soul is madness. All the rest Are full of their proud honour, and disdain To torture with vain villanous misconstruction Each innocent phrase to looseness. Cursed woman! 'Gainst whom remorselessness is loftiest duty, And mercy sin beyond Heaven's graceâthink'st thou To be a Queen, and dare to be a woman! Play fool upon thy dizzy precipice, Nor smile, nor word, nor look, nor thought but's noted In our dark registers; each playful jest Is chronicled, and we are rich in all That's ocular proof and circumstance of guilt To jealousy's distemper'd ear. And thou, Proud King! the Church's head!âeach lustful thought, Each murtherous deed, is a new link of the chain By which our slaves are trammell'd: we'll let slip Thy own fierce passions, ruthless as the dogs Of war, to prey on thy obdurate heart; And they shall drag thee down, base, suppliant, Beneath our feetâor drive thee maddening on, An hideous monster of all guilt, to fright The world from its apostasy, and brand The Heretic cause with thy eternal shame. Whitehall. Queen Anne, Attendants, her Almoner. ALMONER. So please your Majesty, your pensioners Flock in such hungry and still gathering troops, The table's full. QUEEN. Then, Sir, spread more, the Queen Commands it. ALMONER. But the cost, your Grace! QUEEN. Weigh that When thou dost serve ourself, not our poor neighbours. Why sate I down but yesterday, 'mid pomps And luxuries that might have fed a village? Go coin those wines, barter for homelier cates Those candied superfluities. ALMONER. It stands not With the King's honour thus to mulct and limit Your Highness state. QUEEN. Still less, Sir, to contract And weigh with base frugality the alms His Grace bestows through me, his humble agent. The bounty of the King, Heaven's delegate, Should be as Heaven's: the Sun, that through the grate Of some barr'd dungeon lights the pallid cheek Of the poor prisoner, is a gracious gift; But that which argues the great God of Nature Is the rich prodigality of light, That kindles the wide universal sky And gladdens worlds. But to descend to truths Of homelier prudence. 'Tis not well to feast A lazy herd of sleek unlabouring drones. Most true, Sir; but his Majesty hath pleased To take some certain Convents and rich Abbeys Into his royal hands; they that were bred To sun themselves in careless indolence Are cast abroad to buffet the hard world For bare subsistence; even the once mitred Lords Of manors, benefices, lands, and palaces, Ill husbanding their limited maintenance, Are brought to beggary and painful want: Therefore our bounty must outrun awhile Our better wisdom. ALMONER. I obey your Highness. QUEEN. And have our best thanks for your prudent caution As for your prompt compliance.â Gracious Heaven! I thought a throne would give the power of blessing Illimitableâto speak, were to make glad All hearts. Alas! the higher we aspire, The wider spreads beneath us the dark scene Of human wretchedness, which even to lighten Wants not Heaven's goodness only, but Heaven's wisdom, While easy mischief waits on meanest minds. The idiot with a wanton brand may fire Th'imperial city, a base beggar's brood Infect a paradise with pestilence, While deep-laid schemes of princeliest goodness end In wider evil, and thrice heavier ruin. Ye smile to hear these solemn arguments Upon these laughter-loving lips. LADY ROCHFORD. Your Highness Is ever thus, or gladdening with your mirth Or teaching with your wisdom. QUEEN. Lady Rochford, Might I not add that thou art ever flattering? A brother's wife should too sincerely love To pamper a vain heart with praise. LADY ROCHFORD (aside). Still shamed And still rebukedâcurse on her proud humility! QUEEN. Enough of thisâin truth the board that led To this grave reasoning forces oft a smile Even on Compassion's tearful face: the strange, The motley groups! the doubts, the awe, the fears, The pride of beggary! There are, who patch, As though in honour of the royal feast, With scarlet and rich hues their loose hung tatters; And some will creep, as they were led to justice, Along the hall, and the next instant pledge, Like jovial courtiers, the Queen's health. But those Of the old religion move me most. They steal Reluctant with suspicious steps, each instant Crossing themselves, to exorcise, no doubt, The fiends beneath the board: each time they touch Or dish or flagon, they renew the charm, As though the viands flavour'd of rank heresy, And 'twere a deadly sin to taste the dole Of wicked Gospeller. Last noon came in Two maids, whose tatter'd veils but ill conceal'd Their wan and famine sunken cheeks, not worn With holy fast, but bitter withering want; Desperate they ate, as conscious of their sin: Anon a pattering sound of beads I heard, A voice half breathless muttering broken Aves; Lo, the good lady Abbess, come to save Her soul-endanger'd charge; but, sad to tell, The tempting fumes o'erpower'd her holy rigour, And the grave mother to the flesh-pots fell. ATTENDANT. Madam, the Countess Wiltshire. Lady Wiltshire. LADY WILTSHIRE. Dearest Anne! My child!âYour Highness' pardon, my old lips Will never learn th'unwonted reverence; Still clings the old familiar fondness round me. QUEEN. Dear mother, have I ceased to be your child Being a Queen? for your attendance, Ladies, We thank you, and ere long may task your service; But nowâin truth I play the Queen but ill Beside the cradle of my childâand thus Within my mother's armsâ [The Ladies retire. LADY WILTSHIRE. Oh! who had thought Our little playful Anne, all mirth and frolic, The veriest madcap that ere made a mother Tremble, rejoice, and smile, and weep at once, Should sit on England's throne. Nay, if thou bribe not My garrulous age, I may betray strange tales Not all beseeming the high sceptred state Of the Queen's majesty. QUEEN. I much mistrust youâ In truth I do LADY WILTSHIRE. Well, Heaven be praised for all, Chiefly that I and thy good Father, Anne, Have lived with our own eyes to witness it. And now come when it will, thou'lt have me buried In royal state; my funeral pomp shall have Sceptres and royal scutcheons in its train: I'll not endure that my base epitaph Write me plain wife of good Sir Thomas Boleyn; I'll be emblazed in characters of gold, The mother of Queen Anne. QUEEN. Ay, in good time, Some twenty years or more we'll think of this: But, by my faith, best mother, there's no joy Of all that wait like chain'd and harness'd slaves Around the thrones of kingsâthe pomp, the splendour, The hearty voice of popular acclaim, The grave esteem of godly men, the power Boundless of succouring the distress'd, the grace And favour of a royal Husband, worthiest, Were he a peasant, of our fondest dotage; The consciousness of being an humble means To build anew Christ's desolated Churchâ There's nought morefull, sincere, and rapturousânoughtâ Than thus repaying all the pains, the prayers Of her that bore me, nursed me, trained me up To this high doom, making me like herself. Mother, all other joys make my cheek smile; But thy affectionate and blameless pride Makes gladness speak her truer languageâtears And here comes one will not rebuke our weeping, My noble Rochford. Lord Rochford. ROCHFORD. Does your Highness pardon This bold intrusion? QUEEN. I will pardon all But this cold courteous ceremony: I would not, Brother, for my throne, forego My station in thy heart. Wert thou a stranger, Thy letter'd fame had given thee entrance here. 'Tis such as thou adorn a court, less honour'd Than honouring; for you Poets hold a court Which whoso visits not hath lost all title To that nobility endures for ages, Where Kings are proud to enter. There's no clime Nor age, not even the Heaven of Heavens, but sends, Summon'd by your plumed herald Fantasie, Its embassage of noblest images To do you service; and ye entertain them Right royally, do make them move to music That they forget the sounds of their own spheres. ROCHFORD. Your Highness! QUEEN. Nay, your Sister! ROCHFORD. Sweet rebuke: Dear Sister, I've been toiling in your service, Or rather turning toil to sweet delight; I've been enriching my rude verse with thoughts I stole from thee in that religious converse We held some days ago, when we discussed The idolatrous practices of Rome, adoring With disproportionate and erring reverence The Holy Virgin. I've a hymn, methinks Will not offend.âWill 't please your Highness hear it? QUEEN. Most willingly, it suits the hourâfor eve, That steals so softly on the quiet world, Seems made for solemn music, even as nature Breath'd silence over all in earth and Heaven, Vocal alone with grateful man's thanksgiving. ROCHFORD. Hereâcall Mark Smeaton, bid him bring his lute. The above, Smeaton. ROCHFORD. Now, boy, that tune I told thee of within; And look thou touch it masterly: her Grace Hath that nice ear that vibrates to the touch Of harmony, so tremblingly alive The slightest discord jars on it like anguish. Not with that shaking handâ Look, the Queen smiles. Right, boy, thou own'st that inspiration. The Protestant's Hymn to the Virgin. 1 Oh! Virgin Mother! not with choral hymn Around the lamp-deck'd altar high and dim, Where silver bells are faintly ringing, And odorous censers lightly swinging; Till blazing forth above, beneath, around, Rolls the full organ's never-ceasing sound: Not with the costly gift of gold and gem, Where thy enshrined image stands, Loveliest, though fram'd by daring human hands, And halo'd with thy sun-like diadem: Not with the deep devotion of the heart, Close folded arms across the heaving breast, And words that find no breath, and sighs supprestâ Mary, we seek not thee With suppliant agony Of burning tears, that all unbidden start; To mortal name our jealous souls deny The incommunicable meed of Deity. 2 And thou, where'er thy everlasting seatâ If ever human prayer, with noise unmeet, Up to thy radiant throne on high, Ascend through the reluctant sky; Or earthly music its fond notes intrude Upon the silence of beatitude: Lowliest as loveliest among mortal maids! With all the grief that may abate The changeless bliss of thy empyreal state, Ever thy sad dejected look upbraids The misdirected homage, vain and blind; Aside thou turnest thy offended ears Where one Hosanna fills th'acclaiming spheres; Oh! conscious child of Eve, Mary, thy soul doth grieve At godhead's sacred rite to thee assign'd; Mourning the rash unholy injury done To the redeeming name of thy Almighty Son! 3 Yet ne'er Incarnate Godhead might reside, Save where his conscious presence glorified; Thee, therefore, lovelier far we deem Than eye may see or soul may dream. Unchangedâunwasted by the pains of earth, Thou didst bring forth the fair immortal birth: And Hope and Faith, and deep maternal Joy, And Love, and not unholy Pride, With soft unevanescent glory dyed Thy cheeks, while gazing on the peerless boy; And surer than prophetic consciousness, That he was born all human-kind to bless! The musical and peopled air was dim, Mary, where'er thy haunt, With angels visitant, Nor always did the viewless Seraphim Stand with their plumed glories unconfest, To see the Eternal Child while cradled on thy breast. 4 And what, though in the winter, bleak and wild, Thou didst bring forth the unregarded child, The summon'd star made haste to shine Upon that new-born face divine, And the low dwelling of the stabled beast Shone with the homage of the gorgeous East. Though driven far off to Nilus' reedy shore, As thou didst slake thy burning feet, Where o'er the desert fount the arching palm-trees meet: Still its soft pillow'd charge thy bosom bore; And thou didst watch in rapture his sweet sleep; Or gaze, while sportive he thy locks carest, Or drank the living fountain of thy breast. Yet, Mary, o'er thy soul A silent sadness stole, Nor could thy swelling eyes refuse to weep, For Rachel, desolate, in agony, And Bethlehem's mothers childless all but thee. 5 Nor fail'd thy watchful spirit to behold The secret inborn Deity unfold: Nor e'er without a painless awe, The wonderous youth the mother saw; For in the Baptist's playful love appear'd The homage of a heart that almost fear'd: And though in meek subjection still he dwelt Beneath thy husband's lowly home; Oft from his lips would words mysterious come; The soul untaught the present Saviour felt. As more than prophet raptures o'er him broke, And fuller still the inspiration pour'd, Half-bow'd to earth unconscious knees adored: Mary, before thy sight, The wonder-working might, Prerogative of highest Godhead woke; Unfearful yet!âwhen instant at his sign, The water vessels blush'd with generous wine. 6 Blest o'er all women! did thy heart repress, Humble as chaste, each thought of loftiness, When wonder after wonder burst Around the child thy bosom nurst;â The dumb began to sing, the lame to leap; His unwet footsteps trod the unyielding deep; Still at his word disease and anguish ceased, And healthful blood began to flow, Ruddy, beneath the leper's skin of snow; And shuddering fiends the tortured soul released; And from the grave arose the summon'd dead? Yet, ah! did ne'er thy mother's heart repine, When he set forth upon his dread design? Mary, did ne'er thy love His piteous fate reprove, When on the rock reposed his houseless head? Seem'd it not strange to thy officious zealâ All pains, all sorrows, save his own, to heal? 7 Yet, oh! how awful, Desolate! to thee, Thus to have shrined the living Deity! When underneath the loaded Rood, Forlorn the childless mother stood: Then when that voice, whose first articulate breath Thrill'd her enraptured ear, had now in death Bequeath'd her to his care whom best he loved; When the cold death-dew bathed his brow, And faint the drooping head began to bow, Wert thou not, saddest, too severely proved? As in thy sight each rigid limb grew cold, And the lip whiten'd with the burning thirst, And the last cry of o'erwrought anguish burst, Where then the Shiloh's crown, Mary, the Christ's renown, By Prophets and Angelic harps foretold? Was strength to thy undoubting spirit given? Or did not human love o'erpower thy trust in Heaven? 8 But when Death's conqueror from the tomb return'd, Was thine the heart that at his voice ne'er burn'd? Follow'd him not thy constant sight, Slow melting in Heaven's purest white, To take his ancient endless seat on high, On the right hand of Parent Deity? And when thine earthly pilgrimage was ended, We deem not, but that circled round, With ringing harps of Heaven's most glorious sound, Thy spirit, redeem'd through thy Son's blood, ascended: There evermore in lowliest loftiness, Meek thou admirest, how that living God, That fills the Heavens and Earth, in thee abode. Mary, we yield to thee All but idolatry; We gaze, admire, and wonderâlove and bless: Pure, blameless, holy, every praise be thine, All honour save thy Son's, all glory but divine. SCENE. The Palace of the Bishop of Winchester. ANGELO. More blood! more blood!âthree noble brethren more, From the Carthusian's decimated house The execution of the Prior and several of the Brethren of the Carthusian Monastery for denying the King's Supremacy, was amongst the most barbarous transactions of this period, the chief guilt of which must be attributed to the unrelenting disposition of the King., Doom'd to the blockâay, pour it forth like water! Make your Thames red, till your proud galleys plough Their way, and leave a sanguine wake behind them: Set wide the gates of Hell, and summon thence Murder, enthron'd on your high judgment seat; Arm her dark sister, lawless Massacre, With the dread axe of public Execution; Can Hell, or Earth's confederate Kings prevail 'Gainst the true Church?âBut, oh! ye martyr'd souls! Spirits, with whose saintly blood their robes are wetâ Oh! all-accomplished More, and sainted Fisher, Rejoice ye not that with your death ye rouse The fire-wing'd ministers of Heaven's just wrath, That welcoming your souls to th'abode of bliss, Stand with spread wings, and ready girt for vengeance! But ye, the pulpit Captains of the Schism, Worse than the worstâsoul murderers, Hell's Apostlesâ Ye would pour oil into the Church's wounds That your own parricide hands have rent, and think They will not plead against you.âOh! ye blind To earthly wisdom as Heaven's light, that dare not Greatly to sin, or, politicly severe, Crush where ye conquerâye will stand aloof From the black scaffold, preach, protest, forswear All deeds of blood; yet your infected cause Shall smell of it to latest generations! Oh fools! to plunge in internecine strife, Yet pause, and fear to slay:âdeserving none, And by Heaven's throne receiving none, to dream Of showing mercy; either way ye perish, Or shed the martyrs' blood, whose dying voices Arm Earth, Hell, Heaven, 'gainst your ungodly cause; Abstain, the unchecked recoil of our fierce vengeance Shall sweep you to the appointed pit of Hell! Angelo, Gardiner. ANGELO. My Lord of Winchester, thou hast received Our full credentials from St. Peter's chair? GARDINER. Brother in Christ, thou know'st this land rejects Rome's Bishop and his tyrannous usurpation. ANGELO. That Stephen Gardiner owns no power in Rome I know, nor yet in England. What cares he For King or Pontiff, so he may maintain The proud supremacy of Stephen Gardiner. A second, but a greater Wolsey, thou, With thine unbounded soul, would'st rule o'er allâ Church, State, the worldâ GARDINER. Italian, thou'rt too boldâ ANGELO. Too true, good Islander! but think not, Gardiner, I or lament or deprecate thy greatness. What qualities that make man fit to rule Meet not in Winchester's capacious soul? The statesman's large and comprehensive mind; The politician's keen prophetic eye; The scholar's mastery o'er the realm of knowledge; Smooth manners, that with courtly art persuade; The eloquent pen, pregnant with thought profound; Quickness to penetrate each dark design; Sagacity to wind the unwilling soul To his own purpose: wisest in the counsel; Deep read in booksâin man's dark heart still deeper; Most knowing in all Europe's courts. Blest England, If she but prize his worth; himself most blest, If but to his own interests blind, he err not On his ascendant pathâ GARDINER. Your meaning, brother? ANGELO. A Churchman, and abase the Church's rule! To wrest the thunder from his awful grasp, Whose delegates are we, as he is Heaven's, And place it in the temporal tyrant's hands, That hath no scope nor end but his own pride And carnal lust of sway! Rome covets power, But for her sons, with wholesome tyranny, To their own weal, to govern kings and nations. Oh! traitor to thy people, King, and God, As to thyself! to cast away the sceptre That sways man's soul to his immortal vantage! Son of the Holy Church, I exorcise The fiend of disobedience from thine heart; By all thou lov'stâpomp, majesty, dominion, By all thou hat'stâth'apostate cause and crew, Th'all powerful Cranmer!âay, I see thy cheek Blanch, thy low quivering lipâby all thou fear'st, By all thou hop'st, thou 'rt ours, thou 'rt Rome's, thou 'rt Heaven's! GARDINER. Good Father, walls have earsâthe treacherous air, With terrible delation, wanders round The thrones of Kings. ANGELO. Thou think'st not, I or Rome Would urge a rashness, which might wreck our cause: Would have thee cast this wise dissembling off, By which thou hast won the easy confidence Of foolish heretics: be supple still, And seeming true, thou 'rt worthier of our trust. We know thy heart our own, and lend awhile Thy tongue, thy pen, to the proud King, t'abase him To a more abject slave of thee and Rome. Now hear me, Prelate, glut thine ear with tidings, For there are dark and deep delved plots, that scape Even Gardiner's lynx-eyed sightâthy soul shall laugh. The Queenâthe Boleynâthe false harlot hereticâ She's in our toilsâlost, doom'dâ GARDINER. I know the King Is fallen away to a new lust, and hates Where once he doted.âBut her death!â ANGELO. What! versed In courts like Gardiner, and not know how close Death waits upon the blasting hate of Kings? I tell thee, she shall dieâdie on a scaffold! Die branded like a base adulteress!â Die like a hereticâthe Church's foe!â Die unabsolved, unhousel'dâdie for ever! GARDINER. Ay, but her blameless life; the love she wins By subtle sorcery from every rank. ANGELO. Blameless!âan heretic avow'd, proclaim'd, The nursing mother of Apostasy! Heap crime on crime, load all her soul with blackness, Make her name hideous to the end of time; Yet is she not, to a true son of the Church, More odious, more abominableâall sins Are in that one! Adultery, murder, nought Is wanting but desire or meet occasion, And the loose heart gives way. GARDINER. But this Jane Seymour Is of no better brood. ANGELO. What reck we who Or what she is, she shall give place t'another, Another still, till the fierce flame burns out, And shame, remorse, and horror, all the furies That howl and madden round the guilty bed, Seize on the abject Monarch! He shall lick The dust beneath our feet, and pay what price The Church ordain, for tardy reconcilement. GARDINER. Brother, draw near! thy speech hath bodied forth What hath come floating o'er my secret thought. ANGELO. And own'st thou not Heaven's manifest inspiration? GARDINER. So thou wilt bring to pass what Gardiner left In unaccomplish'd vision! Man of men, What fame shall wait, what canonizing glory On sainted Angelo. ANGELO. While Stephen Gardiner Must sink into the baser rank. Oh! fear not, Nor jealously mistrust me, lest I cross Thy upward path: I have forsworn the world, Not with the formal oaths that burst like flax, But those that chain the soul with triple iron. Earth hath no guerdon I may covet, none I may enjoy.âThou, Stephen Gardiner, Shalt rule submissive Prelates, Peers and Kings, Loftiest in station, as in mind the mightiest; And a perpetual noon of golden power Shall blaze around thy lordly mitred state. I'm girt for other journeys: at that hour, When all but crown'd the righteous work, this Isle Half bow'd again to the Holy See, I go Far in some savage land unknown, remote From civilized or reasonable life, From letters, artsâwhere wild men howl around Their blood stain'd altarsâto uplift th'unknown, Unawful Crucifix: I go to pine With famine; waste with slow disease; the loathing And scorn of men. And when thy race is run, Thou, Winchester, in marble cemetery, Where thy cathedral roof, like some rich grove, Spreads o'er, and all the walls with 'scutcheons blaze, Shalt lie. While anthem'd choirs and pealing organs, And incense clouds, and a bright heaven of lamps, Shall solemnize thy gorgeous obsequies; O'er my unsepulchred and houseless bones, Cast on the barren beach of the salt sea, Or arid desert, where the vulture flaps Her dreary wings, shall never wandering Priest Or bid his beads or say one passing pray'r. Thy memory shall live in this land's records While the sea girds the isle; but mine shall perish As utterly as some base beggar's child That unbaptiz'd drops like abortive fruit Into unhallow'd grave. GARDINER. Impossible! Rome cannot waste on such wild service minds Like thine, nor they endure the base obedience. ANGELO. Man of this world, thou know'st not those who tread The steps of great Ignatius, those that bear The name of Jesus and his Cross. I've sunk For ever title, rank, wealthâeven my being; And, self annihilated, boast myself A limb, a nameless limb, of that vast body That shall bespread the world, uncheck'd, untrac'dâ Like God's own presence, every where, yet no whereâ Th'invisible control, by which Rome rules The universal mind of man. On me My Father's palace gates no more shall open, I own no more my proud ancestral name, I have no property even in these weeds, These coarse and simple weeds I wear; nor will, Nor passion, nor affection, nor the love Of kindred touch this earth-estranged heart; My personal being is absorbed and dead. Thou think'st it much with cilice, scourge, and fast To macerate thy all-too pamper'd body, That thy sere heart is seal'd to woman's love, That child shall never climb thy knees, nor call thee His father:âon the altar of my God I've laid a nobler sacrifice, a soul Conscious it might have compass'd empire.âThis I've done; and in no brief and frantic fit Of youthful lust ungratifiedâin the hour Of disappointed pride. A noble born Of Rome's patrician blood, rich, letter'd, versed In the affairs of men; no monkish dreamer Hearing Heaven's summons in ecstatic vision. God spoke within this heart but with the voice Of stern deliberate duty, and I rose Resolved to sail the flood, to tread the fireâ That's noughtâto quench all natural compunction, To know nor right nor wrong, nor crime nor virtue, But as subservient to Rome's cause and Heaven's. I've school'd my haughty soul to subtlest craft, I've strung my tender heart to bloodiest havoc, And stand prepared to wear the martyr's flames Like nuptial robes;âfar worse, to drag to the stake My friend, the brother of my soulâif thus I sear the hydra heads of heresy. GARDINER. Think not thine order, brother, nor thy tenets, Sublime as that unquestioning devotion With which God's Seraphim perform his mandates, Unknown, unnoticed, unobserved. I lay The volume of this heart, that man ne'er read, Before thee. Here is hate of heresy, Deep, desperate as thine own. In the dead night, And in the secret prayers of my dark chamber, Like thee I cry, Holy and True, how longâ Oh! when will they blaze up and gladden heaven, The glorious purifying fires, and purge The land of its pollutions; when the Church Its pure and virgin whiteness rearray, And its true Sons shake off dissembling darkness? ANGELO. Oh! Gardiner, beware! No lust of vengeance, No carnal hate, nor hope of worldly triumph, Must leaven our heroic zeal: God's will Its sole commission, its sole end God's glory. We must gird up our souls to this high service, Alike subdue and bend our pride and passions To our great scope; with nought too stern or dread But that we'll on relentless, nought too base But we will stoopâmuch is already doneâ GARDINER. Enough, I ask no more, would know no more. I'll stand aloof, and wait in holy hope Th'appointed hour. ANGELO. In safety reap the harvest Sown in the sweat of other's brows. 'Tis well, Thus shall it be, thus best the cause will prosper; And, prosper but the cause, my work is done. Whitehall. QUEEN (dismissing her ladies). Awayâwe are not used to order twice; Awayâdepart.â I am aloneâaloneâ Nor that cold hateful pomp of fawning faces Pursues me, nor the true officious love Of those whose hearts I would not wring, by seeming The wretch I am: so pour thee forth, mine heart, Pour thy full tide of bitterness; for Queens Must weep in secret when they weep. I saw itâ 'Twas no foul visionâwith unblinded eyes I saw it: his fond hands, as once in mine, Were wreath'd in hers; he gazed upon her face Even with those sorcerous eyes, no woman looks atâ I know it, ah! too wellânor madly dote. That eloquence, the self-same burning words That seize the awe-struck soul, when weakest, thrill'd Her vainly-deaf averted ears.âOh, Heaven! I thank thee that I cursed her not, nor him. Jane Seymour, like a sister did I deem thee; But what of that? Thou'rt heaven-ordain'd to visit Her sins upon the head of her that dared To love, to wed another's lord. May'st thou Ne'er know the racking anguish of this hour, The desolation of this heart! But thou, Oh! thou, my crime, my madness! thou on whom The loftiest woman had been proud to dote, Had he been master of a straw roof'd cottage! Was't just to awe, to dazzle the young mind, That deem'd its transport loyal admiration, Submissive duty all, till it awoke And found it thrilling, deepest woman's love? Too late, too early disabusedâwould Heaven That I were still abused! Long, long I've felt Love's bonds fall one by one from thy pall'd heart. Oh! the fond falsehoods of my credulous soul! War, policy, religion, all the cares Of kingdoms, Europe's fate within thy hands, I pleaded to myself to justify Thy cold estrangement. Well, 'tis o'er, and I Must sit alone on my cold eminence, All women's envy, mine own scorn and pity. And all the sweetness of these virgin lips, And all the pureness of this virgin bosom, And all the fondness of this virgin heart, Forgotten, turn'd to scornâperchance to loathing. Heaven! was no way but this, and none but He To scourge this guilty heart? Thy will be done. I've still a noble Father, and a Brother, And, Powers of grace! my Motherâkill her not, Break not her heart,âfor sure 'twill break to hear it. My child, my child, thou only wilt not feel it: Thy parent o'er thy face may weep, nor thou Be sadder for her misery; thou wilt love me Though thy false father scorn and loathe. My Motherâ Oh! ne'er before would I have fled thy presence: Betray me not, my tear swoln eyes. Queen, Lady Wiltshire. LADY WILTSHIRE. Dear Anne, I come to task thy goodness: thou must use That witching influence none e'er resists; That, with a sweet and pardonable treason Makes the King's Grace thy slave, nor leaves him pow'r To think or speak but at thy pleasureâ QUEEN (aside). Heaven! Each word wrings blood from my torn heart. LADY WILTSHIRE. In truth, There never lived who could refuse thee ought; For thou wert never known to ask amiss. But, thou'rt all tears. QUEEN. Noughtânoughtâthy story, Mother. LADY WILTSHIRE. Ay, nothing sure will chase away thy weakness, Be 't of the body or the mind, so soon As that sweet consciousness that thou art using The power Heaven gave thee in Heaven's cause. His Grace The Primate waits without t'implore your Highness, That the old high-born Prior of the Carthusians, And two right noble brethren of that house, That, obstinate and self will'd, still subscribe not The King's supreme dominion, may find mercy, Nor perish on the ignominious scaffold. QUEEN. My Lord of Canterbury at our door! The presence of that righteous man, dear Mother, Breathes sanctity as though from Heaven; our hearts O'erflow at once with prayer and holiest thoughts. Admit his Grace. The above. Cranmer. QUEEN. Your blessing, holy Father. CRANMER. Heaven save your Highness! But, remember, Lady, Prayers of anointed Priests or mitred Prelates Are poor and valueless to such as come From those that wear Christ's truest livery, The wretched and the broken hearted. QUEEN (aside). Heaven, I own thy voiceâthen mine are surely heard. CRANMER. I'll teach your Grace to do Heaven violence, By shrining your blest name in vows of men, From death released, from cruel public death. The Countess Wiltshire hath made known our suit; And though my soul abhor the wilful hardness Of these proud men, yet they were nursed in errorâ In error, but for all-enlightening grace, That still had darken'd our own souls. Were Heaven Extreme t'avenge its outraged majesty, Would the red roaring thunder ever cease? And shall the axe earth's injured Monarchs wield Be never satiate with the offending blood? QUEEN. Had I the power! CRANMER. The power! thou'st ever been The rainbow o'er the awful throne. The King, That lives but in thy presence, ne'er disdain'd Thy righteous supplication. Oh! great Queen, Our cause, the Gospel cause, the cause of Christ, Is spotted o'er with shame. Rude sacrilege Usurps the name of godly Reformation, And revels in the spoil of shrine and altar. Men have cast down the incensed heathenish image To worship with more foul idolatry The gold of which 'twas wrought; and all the blood The too relentless Law for Treason sheds, Attaints our blameless faith of direst cruelty. QUEEN (aside). More woe, more woeâto know these holy hopes, This noble trust, misplaced and frustrate all! Your Grace o'ervalues our poor influence, Such as it is. LADY WILTSHIRE. The King! QUEEN. I'll know the worst. Dear Mother, leave us. Come contempt or shame, She must not witness it: but he the rather Will seek to compensate the heart's deep wrongs By outward graciousness. Wretch, wretch myself, I may relieve the wretchedness of others:â Be 't as it may, the world shall never know Through me the secret of his sin, his falsehood, But deem him by my love the gentlest husband As the most noble Monarch upon Earth. King Henry. KING. Refuse our mandateâshut their Abbey gates Against our Poursuivantsârefuse our oathsâ Now, by St. Paul, not one of them shall wear His shaven crown on his audacious shoulders! CRANMER. Your Majesty will hear your faithful servant. KING. I'll none of itâtheir heads or their allegiance. God's death! have all our Parliament and Peers, Our Rev'rend Bishops, given their hands and seals, And shall we thus be mocked and set at nought By beggarly and barefoot monks? Archbishop, Out of our love to thine own reverend person, We do refuse thy most unwise petition. Good foolish man, not one of them but urged By that old Priest of the Seven Hills would burn us, Body and soul. We'll have no Kings but one, None but ourself.âTut, not a word. How now? What, Nan? what blank? what all a mort? Thy jests, And thy quaint sayings, and thy smilesâ QUEEN. My Liege, I have been sued to be a suppliant For those that, fall'n beneath thine high displeasureâ KING. 'Sdeath! ye've our answerâas I pass'd but now Jane Seymour was set on t'entreat our mercy; We yielded not, nor thought of being wearied At every step with the old tedious taleâ Art answer'd? QUEEN. What I am, I owe your Grace, And in most deep humility confess it; But being as I am, your Grace's wife, I knew not that my maid's rejected prayer Precluded further speechâ KING. Why, how now, wayward! Your maid! good truth, Sir Thomas Boleyn's daughter's Right nobly served. I'd have you know, proud woman, What the King gives, the King may take awayâ Who raised up one from dust, may raise another. Look to thyself, I sayâthou may'st have cause; Look, and be wiseâbe humble. For your Grace We've business in our Councilânot a wordâ Our Queen's our subject still. QUEEN (alone). And this is he, The flower of the world's chivalry, most courtly Where met the splendor of all courts! When Europe Sent its three Sov'reigns to that Golden field, Which won all eyes with liberal noble bearing? Which charm'd all ears with high and gracious speech? Which made all hearts his slaves by inbred worth But English Henry? by his pattern all Moved, spoke, rode, tilted, shaped their dress, their language, And he that most resembled England's King Was kingliest in the esteem of all. This he That lay whole hours before my worshipp'd feet, Making the air melodious with his words? So fearful to offend, having offended So fearful of his pardon, not myself More jealous of my maiden modesty; The bridegroom of my youth, my infant's Father! Ah! me, my rash and inconsiderate speech, My pride, hath wrought from his too hasty nature This shame upon mine head: he'll turn, he'll come My prodigal back to mine heartâif not, I'm born his subject, sworn before high Heaven His faithful wife; then let him cast me from him, Spurn, trample me to dustâthe foe, the stranger That owns no law of kindred, blood, or duty, Is taught, where every word is Heaven's own oracle, To love where most he's hated. I will live On the delicious memory of the past, And bless him so for my few years of bliss, My lips shall find no time for harsh reproach; I'll be as one of those sweet flowers, that crush'd By the contemptuous foot, winds closer round it, And breathes in every step its richest odours. An Apartment in Westminster. Angelo, Lady Rochford. ANGELO. In that proud Prelate's heart a noble chord All writers agree in the unprincipled and unnatural character of the Countess of Rochford, who suffered at a subsequent period for being accessary to the criminal conduct of Queen Catharine Howard. I touch'd, now harp we on a baser string. The Lady Rochford! thou art here to tell me That thou fulfill'st the terms on which the Church, In its high plenitude of power, absolves The guilty soul. LADY ROCHFORD. I come, Sir, to advise With your wise sanctity. ANGELO. We've judged already, And look but for obedienceâhast thou scatter'd Those hints and seeds of hate in the King's path, That he behold this Queen in her true colours? LADY ROCHFORD. I have; with zeal so fatal, with success So manifest, mine inmost soul recoils At the base service. ANGELO. Hast obtain'd that paper In Lady Wingfield's hand? LADY ROCHFORD. 'Tis here. ANGELO. Good! good!â LADY ROCHFORD. Inexorable!âmust I show no mercy? Must crime be still atoned by crime? Oh! think, She is my husband's sisterâhis, the bridegroom Of my fond youthâ ANGELO. To whom thou art so true And faithful! LADY ROCHFORD. Ha! what need of words to thee, That read'st the inmost depths of this dark heart More clearly than myselfâI hate that husband, For that I've injured him so deeply; hate Her virtue that reproaches mine own shame: But yet to slander her pure fameâ ANGELO. You said Erewhile you doubted her yourself. LADY ROCHFORD. The sinful Have a base interest to drag down the holy To their own level. Set me some strange penance, Shall grind the flesh, and wring the heart's-blood forth; Oh! any thing but this base wicked service! ANGELO. Thou wilt do all but what the Church commands. What is it for a life like thineâa life That doth confess, bewail, forswear its sins, But with new zest t'indulgeâthat com'st so oft With the foul tale, that I do fear to breathe The tainted air of my confessional? For such a life is not that place ordain'd Where air is fire, life pain, and language howling? LADY ROCHFORD. Oh! horror! ANGELO. Look that thou perform our bidding To the strict letter, the extremest point, Wary and secret, as becomes a servant Would merit grace and favour. LADY ROCHFORD. I'm no servantâ A slaveâa lash'd, a crouching, abject slave, In the iron bondage of my sins! ANGELO. Ungrateful! When I might hurl thee, black with malediction, Where all thy direst visions of remorse, The racking moments of remember'd crime, The fangs of Conscience tearing at thy heart, Thy tossing, feverish, spectre-staring midnights, Would seem remission, peace, delight to years Interminableâ LADY ROCHFORD. Oh! my soul! my soul! ANGELO. And I have taught thee how to merit favour From those to whom the eternal keys are givenâ Tinged your black desperation with the hue Of hopeâAway! back to thy dutyâwatch! And those who weigh in the everlasting scales Service against rebellion, and obedience Against transgression, may at length strike down The balance, and pronounce thee what thou dar'st notâ Thou dost notâhope may be thy lot.âAway! The Garden, as before. Mark Smeaton, Magdalene Smeaton. MAGDALENE. My brother! MARK. Oh! her voiceâit will not ceaseâ It sounds within my ears, within my heart. And thou, my harp once loved, but now a treasure Which kingdoms will not buy; of her sweet tones Thou'lt keep the perfume, as the Arabian air The smell of spices. MAGDALENE. Mark, thou'rt strangely moved; Speak to meâkeep from her no jealous secret, From her who loves thee with so whole a heart: Nor thy unkindness, were't in thy soft natureâ Nor sorrows, they would but endear thee moreâ Nor even thy sins, if that way I could fear theeâ Could e'er estrangeâ MARK. The Queen! the Queen! my sister: She sent for meâshe made me sit before her. As my hand trembled on my lute, she smiled With gracious playfulnessâoh! what a store Of precious memories I've treasured upâ Look, motion, word, like relics, have I shrined them In the heart's sanctuary, where all my thoughts Shall come in daily pilgrimage devout Till I am dust and clay. I miserable, With such a refuge! sinful, with the power Of her controlling holiness about me! MAGDALENE. Oh! brother, brother, my misgiving heart Recoils, it knows not why, from words that sound Like dangerous profanation: I have forsworn All love but that which cloister'd nuns may feel Before the bleeding crucifix; but yet I feel that there is sin in thy wild language, Sin, not less deep in thought because in deed Impossible.âLo! Father Angelo. MARK. This awful man again!âmust we ne'er meet But his appalling look, inscrutable Yet scrutinizing all, must cite to judgment Each passing thought, each word, each wishâ MAGDALENE. Mark, Mark, Do any but the guilty dread the presence Of holiest men? He comes to visit here The mother of my youth, whose outcast age Hath none but me, of all our scatter'd convent, To smooth her dying pillow, watch her wants; And none but Father Angelo t'attend her, So constantly as though no soul but hers Needed his zealous function. Angelo. The above. ANGELO. So, fair youth, Our prophecies fall trueâthou'rt i' the sunshine. Last eve, I ask not, if the dangerous song Beseem'd a son of Holy Churchâthat sin Be theirs not thine. MARK. How knew he this? ANGELO. Had those That take in charge th'eternal souls of men No ways of knowledge to the vulgar eye Inscrutable, our task were ill fulfill'd. So tell me, youth, and look that thou speak truth, Truth to the word, the letter, even the toneâ Fell no peculiar private passages, Nor word, nor sign, nay, nor familiar motion, Emphatic tone, nor more expressive pause, Between thyself and the Queen's Grace? MARK. Good Sir, Think on my baseness and her stateâ ANGELO. So young And so dishonest! Boy, look to 't! Thy soul, Thy soul that lives in bliss or dies for ever, Is on the hazard (but I speak in love, And not in anger) spake she not more gently? Glanced not her eye more kindly than 'twas wont? Drank not her ears thy songs with longer rapture? Awes not her presence less, and charms the more?â Boy, boy, take heedâbe warn'd, be wise. MARK. Sir, Sir, Is't possible, in human nature! where, In History or Legend, wild and marvellous, Is't written, that a Queenâa Queen like herâ The Queen of Queens in beauty and in goodness, Stoop'd to consider one like me? ANGELO. This life Hath strange vicissitudes. This Queen, this partner Of England's throne, I can remember well The Duchess of AlenÃ§on once esteem'd Of note scarce higher in her royal court Than thou in England'sâso, once more, beware. There is no price man's enemy will not pay For one immortal soul. Now, the good Abbessâ Daughter, advanceâhow fares it with your charge? MAGDALENE. Sir, longing for your presence, as the blind For light: your holy words breathe deeper calmness O'er all her frame, than medicine's opiate drugs; Her only fear of death is lest she want Your parting benediction. ANGELO. InâI'll follow. MARK. Will he not warn me not to wing the air, Lest I should fly too near the parching Sun, And shrivel into dust?âTo doubt his wisdom Were to impeach man's general estimate; T'arraign his charity would give the lie To a whole life of painful sanctity, And slur th'anointed Priesthood with contempt. Yet herâof her to speak, to think, t'imagine Less than the purest, chastest, holiest, bestâ An Angel by Heaven's providence unplumed, Lest, weary of this tainting world, she fly Untimely to her native skies; and I, A poor, unknown, a homeless, friendless boyâ The more I think the wilder grow my thoughts, And every thought is stamp'd with her bright image; She is my world of fantasy, each sound Is as her voice, each gleam of light her look, And midnight hath no vision but of her. Whitehall. Queen and Ladies, Sir Henry Norreys, Sir Francis Weston, Sir William Brereton, Mark Smeaton. NORREYS. Your Majesty will grace the tilt to-day? QUEEN. The King so wills it: mine obedience rather Than mine own humour sways my choice. NORREYS. I had dared To hope that he, your Grace has deign'd to name Your Knight, being Champion of the ring, your Highness Had given him victory by your presence. QUEEN. Norreys, Trust me, I wish thee all that proud success Thy valour and thy truth deserve. NORREYS. That wish Is triumphâand my vaunting adversaries Are strewn already at my feet. QUEEN. Sir Henry, This language breathes of the blithe air of France; It brings back recollections of my youth, When all my life was like a jocund dream, Or air of gayest music:âbut, time pressesâ So, Gentlemen, in the old Knightly phrase, Go bear you bravely for your Mistress' sake. WESTON. Our Mistress thus commanding, what true Knight Can fail or falter. QUEEN. Courteous words, Sir Francis; But I mistake me or that name calls up Anotherâand, in truth, a fairer lady. WESTON. Notâas I live. QUEEN. Take heed! false oath, false Knight: Enough of thisâ NORREYS. We kiss your Highness' hands, And with this talisman of strength set forth. QUEEN. Heaven prosper you! [MARK SMEATON kneels also. How now? thou'rt over-bold: Thou dost forget thy rank and station, youth; Thou'rt not, I deem, of gentle blood. MARK. No, no, A look suffices me. QUEEN. Truth, noble Sirs, Your gallantry's infectious; this poor youth Must need admire and imitate your courtesies: Take heed that thou offend no moreâbe modest, As thou wert wont. And now to horse, Sir Knightsâ Go forward, and Heaven speed the brave and noble! So now to Greenwich, to look gay and light As this May morning, with a heart as heavy As dull November; to be thought the happiest, Be the most wretched of all womankind. [Exeunt. Near Whitehall. Gardiner and Angelo. ANGELO. My Lord of Winchesterâthou'st seen the King? GARDINER. I've seen a raging madman loose; he came From Greenwich at full speed; their horses seem'd Like those who ride for life from a lost battle:â What hath befallen? ANGELO. The game is won ere played! It fires beyond our hopes, the sulphurous train Flames up, they're hurl'd aloft, but not to Heaven. Wake, Hell! and lift thy gates; and ye, that tenant The deepest, darkest, most infuriate pit, Th'abyss of all abysses, blackest blackness, Where that most damning sin, the damning others, With direst, most remorseless expiation, Howls out its drear eternity, arouse The myriad voices of your wailing; loud As when the fleshly Luther, or the chief Of his cursed crew have one by one gone down To tread your furnace chambers!âRise! prepare The throne of fire, the crown of eating flames! She comesâthe Queen, the fatal Queen, whose beauty Hath been to England worse, more full of peril, Than Helen's was to Troy, hath seal'd for death, For death eternal, irremediable, Whole generations of her godless sons, And made her stately church a heap of ruin! GARDINER. I am no heretic: why keep me thus Upon the rack? ANGELO. When slightest accidents Lead to effects that change the doom of nations, Dost thou not read the visible hand of Heaven? GARDINER. Who questions it? ANGELO. Why then beholdâadore it! My Lord, we're wise and politic, but yet A foolish kerchief falling to the ground Shall more advance our high and righteous cause Than months of subtlest craft. GARDINER. Explain. ANGELO. I stood Within the tilt-yard, not to take delight Carnal, unpriestly, in the worldly pageant: Though, Heaven forgive me! when the trumpets blew, And the lists fell, and Knights as brave, and full Of valour as their steeds of fire, wheel'd forth, And moved in troops or single, orderly As youths and maidens in a village dance, Or shot, like swooping hawks, in straight career; The old Caraffa rose within my breastâ Struggled my soul with haughty recollections Of when I rode through the outpour'd streets of Rome, Enamouring all the youth of Italy With envy of my noble horsemanship. But I rebuked myself, and thought how Heaven Had taught me loftier mastery, to rein And curb with salutary governance Th'unmanaged souls of men. But to our purpose; Even at the instant, when all spears were levell'd, And rapid as the arblast bolt, the Knights Spurr'd one by one to the ring, when breathless leant The Ladies from their galleriesâfrom the Queen's A handkerchief was seen to fall; but while Floating it dallied on the air, a Knight, Sir Henry Norreys, as I learnt, stoop'd down, Caught, wreath'd it in his plume, regain'd his spear, And smote right home the quivering ring: th'acclaim Burst forth like roaring waters, but the King Sprang up, and call'd to horse, while tumult wild Broke up the marr'd and frighted ceremony. GARDINER. Something of this I augur'd: as the King Swept furious by, he beckon'd me; yet seem'd Too busied with his wrathful thoughts to heed Whom thus he summon'd; and I heard him mutter âThe saucy groom!â and terms, which to repeat Were not o'erfitting priestly lips, but coupled With the Queen's name most strangely. Seeing this, I thought it in mine office to administer Grave ghostly admonition, mingled well With certain homily and pulpit phrases Of man's ingratitude, and gracious Kings Whose bounties are abused; the general looseness Of the age. The more I spake, the more he madden'd, As though my words were oil on fire. ANGELO. 'Twas well, But must be better; I have further tidings. I pass'd the Tower, and saw Sir William Kingston, Summon'd, 'twas said, with special haste, come forth Among his archers. GARDINER. Ha! there's more in this. ANGELO. Prelate, there shall beâwhere's the King? GARDINER. I left him Near the apartment of Jane Seymour. ANGELO. Good! The field of battle where we have them all At vantage.âLead me to him. GARDINER. Thee? ANGELO. What! jealous still? Then go thyselfâbe speedy. Thou lovest the King, my Lord of Winchester: Suits it thy reverence, then, and holy station, Nearest his bosom, in his closest counsels, That he retain a wanton in his bosom, When there is one hath damning evidence At peril of his life? GARDINER. Where? who? ANGELO. The Man Am I.âThou see'st, my Lord, thine all the glory, The gratitude for this great serviceâmine The peril. Strike, strike now, strike home, my Lord. GARDINER. I see it: as we pass, thou shalt unfold All that remains behind; and, trust me, Brother, Thou shalt have thy reward. ANGELO. I shallâin Heaven. Whitehall. QUEEN. What can it mean? Each face as I pass'd by Was gathering blackness; and a silent pity Sate upon brows that turn'd aside to avoid me. The menials are infected: not a groom, As I descended from my litter, lent His hand to aid me; and my anti-rooms Are mute and empty, even as though the plague Had tainted all the air. Well, what of this?â Oh, God of Grace! thou'rt bounteous still! Fall off The cumbrous trappings and appendages Of mine uneasy state, thou leav'st me yet One far too old and one too young to change: My child, my Mother, and my Innocence, Shall make me up a blest society, An Empress girt about with handmaid-queens Might envy.âAt her charge I left my Mother, Her charge, whose joy renews her youth, and makes her Like some fond nurse o'er her first bornâ Lady Wiltshire. LADY WILTSHIRE. Come, come, She sleepsâthyself, dear Anne, not half so lovely: Come sit by her, and gaze on her, for hours, For days: a violet on a bed of snow, A pearl in ivory set, the brightest star Where all are bright in the soft milky wayâ There's no similitude she doth not shame. Her forehead arch'd by Heaven to fit a crown! I've almost wish'd thou ne'er shouldst bear a boy, Dear Anne, to bar her from the throne she's born to. QUEEN. Mother, I follow thee. The above. Kingston and Guard. QUEEN. Ha! in my chamber Arm'd men! Sir William Kingston, thou'rt o'er bold To press unbidden on our privacy. KINGSTON. By the King's special mandate, I attach Your Highness. QUEEN. Stay, Sir, as you hope for mercy. My mother! she is old and fondâher heart Will break. Dear Motherâbackâgo backâthe King, Willing to do your daughter honour, sends Good Kingston and his guard. God pardon me! The first untruth that e'er defiled my lips. Now, Sir, your message: the King's Grace, I heard, In his displeasure for some weighty cause, Commands his Queen to prison; I obey, Sir. KINGSTON. Your Majesty must hold yourself in readiness T'imbark on the instant for the Tower. QUEEN. The Tower! Oh, mother! mother! that the time should come When I should wish thee in thy quiet grave. My childâthat I should wish thee yet unborn;â Shall I find justice, Sir? The singular conduct and language of Anne when she was arrested is strictly historical. See Burnet's History of the Reformation. KINGSTON. The meanest subject In all the realm would not impeach the equity Of the King's Grace with such a dangerous doubt. [Queen bursts into laughter. Your Highness! QUEEN. Start ye thus to see me laugh? There's laughter that is grief's most bitter language, Laughter that hath no mirthâand such is mine. Lieutenant of the Tower, I tell thee this: I've done, Sir, in my days, some good, through Christ; If they misjudge my cause, yea, but a jot, The fiery indignation from above Shall blast the bosom of this land, the skies Shall be as brass, nor rain nor drop of dew Shall moisten the adust and gaping earth. KINGSTON. I would beseech your Highness to compose Your too distemper'd mind. QUEEN. Where are the Bishops, The holy Bishops? They will plead my cause, And make my enemies kneel at my footstool. I needs must laugh, Sir, but I'll weep anon, Weep floods, weep life blood, weep till every heart Shall ache and burst to see me. Now I'll kneelâ Behold me kneel!âand imprecate Heaven's vengeance If I'm not guiltless. Comeâawayâawayâ Is your barge ready? Sooner to my judgment, Sooner to my deliverance.âSo, back To those I dare not name, I dare not think of. The Garden as before. Angelo, Mark Smeaton. ANGELO. Good youth, I know not if it grieve me more, Thy fair preferment thus is nipp'd i' the bud, Or give me joy that thou hast 'scaped the snares That might have limed thy soul. MARK. Is it then true, Sir? Is't possible? Thou art all truth, thou wilt not Torture my heart with such a hideous falsehood. There was a rude tall fellow with a halberd, Who spake of it, and with his villainous jests And fiendish laughter tainted the Queen's name, Her snowy, spotless, air-embalming name! I told him to his teeth he lied; and if His scoffing fellows had not troop'd around him, I'd struck him to the earth. ANGELO. Rash boy, beware! This sounds like treason. MARK. If the King himself Set such example to high heaven, cast off Its richest bounties with such insolent scorn, What wonder if ingratitude become The fashion of his court, and the most favour'd Change to the blackest traitors? ANGELO. Mark, 'tis true The Queen is order'd prisoner to the Towerâ Most true; yet know'st thou not the worst: the King Has changed to such a deadly hate against her, That she must dieâ MARK. Die! die!âNo, Sir, no soul Will load itself with such a deep damnation: Earth would break out in execration, Heaven With unexampled thunders interdict The horrible sentence! ANGELO. Youth, I'll trust thee farther. Come hither, closeâthy love to thy lost mistress Warrants my somewhat dangerous confidence: She stands between the King and a new lustâ He must be widow'd, e'er his guilty heart Glut its foul appetite. MARK. Oh! reverend Father, Does not thy flesh grow cold, thy holy heart Sicken still more and more at this bad world? For me, for me, she will so hallow deathâ She will so darken and make void this earth At her departureâI and all true servants Will seek out our untimely graves, to attend, Adore her, in a better world; at least, Not live in this, when sunless of her presence. ANGELO. Now, as a heretic I love her not, But yet my charity would not she were cast, Where she must perish body and soul in hell; I'd have her liveâlive on, in shame and sorrow; For sorrow is the mother of true penitence. MARK. Is there no way to save her? ANGELO. None. MARK. Then, farewell All hope, all joy in this world's wilderness, A barren waste of sand, the fountain dried That was its life and gladness.â ANGELO. None, but that At which our nature shudders, that would damn The name to blackest branded infamy, Would peril the eternal soul, would give The fiends such awful vantage, by a crime, A wilful crime, so like th'accursed Judas, That good men would not stay to seek the cause, But heap the head with merciless execration. Where shall we find, in these degenerate days, Devotion more than Roman?âWho will risk His fame, his soul, to save a woman's life, And give a heretic time to pluck the brand Of her lost soul out of hell fire? MARK. Good Father, Wrap not thy speech in darkness. ANGELO. If the King, On some just plea (and these new Gospellers Do admit none but foul adultery) Were but divorcedâhow long, how honourably Liv'd the Imperial Catherine!âwhich were bestâ Her spotless name be tainted, or her body Writhe on a scaffold, and her soul in flames? MARK. Horrible! horrible!âto live with name Spotted with shame, or die for aye!â ANGELO. E'en soâ To bear a branded life, nor maid, nor widow, Nor wife; for who would wed a tainted outcast? She were beneath the lowest groom. MARK. True, true. On, I beseech you, Sir. ANGELO. Do we not force The deadliest poison down the best-lov'd lips, If, by its wholesome intervention, life Be prison'd in the mortal frame? We hate At first the stern physician, but erewhile The wiser heart o'erflows with grateful love. MARK. Good reverend Sir, tell me at onceâdirectly, With no prudential riddling in thy phrase, What must he do would save the Queen? ANGELO. Avouch, And with a solemn oath, in the face of Heaven, That they have done together that foul sin That taints the lips to speak, the heart to think on. MARK. Oh! but 't must be a nobler perjury. Who would believe th'impossible falsity Averr'd by baser lips? ANGELO. Those that would fain Believe, are ne'er o'er-nice or scrupulous. MARK. Too much at once, with falsehood to blaspheme Such goodness, on this side of Heaven unknown, And be a base and perjured wretch! ANGELO. The Church, On meet occasionâand what cause more noble Than possible redemption of a soul Like hers, sold captive to the heretic crew?â Hath power to absolve the guilt of falsest oaths. MARK. Dost say so? ANGELO. Oh! that soft luxurious neck Bare on the cold dark block to lie, the axe Come gleaming down with horrid expeditionâ MARK. I'll do'tâ ANGELO. Thou! soft and timorous boy! MARK. I'll do't If fiends stand plucking at my soul, and Hell Yawn at my feet! Thou, Father, thou wilt case My soul in adamantine resolution. I'll save her, if I die, on earthâfor ever! Do with me as thou wiltâI'll speak, I'll swear, I'll pull down good men's imprecations, Heaven'sâ No, Heaven will pardon if I save the heavenly! Upon my head rain curses, contumelies, She will erewhile be taught to bless me; ways Will sure be found to teach her why I've dared Thus 'gainst my nature, bold and falseâshe'll know it, She'll know it allâmy pains, my hopes, my truth!â Anne Boleyn landing at the Tower. Sir William Kingston, Guards. QUEEN. Hereâhere, then, all is o'er!âOh! awful walls, Oh! sullen towers, relentless gates, that open Like those of Hell, but to receive the doom'd, The desperateâOh! ye black and massy barriers, But broken by yon barr'd and narrow loopholes, How do ye coop from this, God's sunshine world Of freedom and delight, your world of woe, Your midnight world, where all that live, live on In hourly agony of death! Vast dungeon, Populous as vast, of your devoted tenants! Long ere our bark had touch'd the fatal strand, I felt your ominous shadows darken o'er me, And close me round; your thick and clammy air, As though 'twere loaded with dire imprecations, Wailings of dying and of tortured men, Tainted afar the wholesome atmosphere. KINGSTON (to the Guard). Advance your halberds. QUEEN. Oh! Sir, pauseâone look, One last long look, to satiate all my senses. Oh! thou blue cloudless canopy, just tinged With the faint amber of the setting sun, Where one by one steal forth the modest stars To diadem the sky:âthou noble river, Whose quiet ebb, not like my fortune, sinks With gentle downfall, and around the keels Of those thy myriad barks mak'st passing music:â Oh! thou great silent city, with thy spires And palaces, where I was once the greatest, The happiestâI, whose presence made a tumult In all your wondering streets and jocund marts:â But most of all, thou cool and twilight air, That art a rapture to the breath! The slave, The beggar, the most base down-trodden outcast, The plague-struck livid wretch, there's none so vile, So abject, in your streets, that swarm with lifeâ They may inhale the liquid joy Heaven breathesâ They may behold the rosy evening skyâ They may go rest their free limbs where they will: But Iâbut I, to whom this summer world Was all bright sunshine; I, whose time was noted But by succession of delightsâOh! Kingston, Thou dost remember, thou wert then Lieutenant, 'Tis nowâhow many years?âmy memory wandersâ Since I set forth from yon dark low-brow'd porch, A brideâa monarch's brideâKing Henry's bride! Oh! the glad pomp, that burn'd upon the watersâ Oh! the rich streams of music that kept time With oars as musicalâthe people's shouts, That call'd Heaven's blessings on my head, in sounds That might have drown'd the thundersâI've more need Of blessing now, and not a voice would say it. KINGSTON. Your Grace, no doubt, will long survive this trial. QUEEN. Sir, Sir, it is too late to flatter me: Time was I trusted each fond possibility, For hope sate queen of all my golden fortunes; But nowâ KINGSTON. Day wears, and our imperious mandate Brooks no delayâadvance. QUEEN. Back, back, I say!â I will not enter! Whither will ye plunge me? Into what chamber, but the sickly air Smells all of bloodâthe black and cobweb'd walls Are all o'ertraced by dying hands, who've noted In the damp dews indelible their tale Of tortureânot a bed nor straw-laid pallet But bears th'impression of a wretch call'd forth To execution. Will ye place me there, Where those poor babes, their crook-back'd uncle murder'd, Still haunt?âInhuman hospitality! Look there! look there! fear mantles o'er my soul As with a prophet's robe, the ghostly walls Are sentinel'd with mute and headless spectres, Whose lank and grief-attenuated fingers Point to their gory and dissever'd necks, The least a lordly noble, some like princes: Through the dim loopholes gleam the haggard faces Of those, whose dark unutterable fate Lies buried in your dungeons' depths; some wan With famine, some with writhing features fix'd In the agony of torture.âBack! I say: They beckon me across the fatal threshold, Which none may pass and live. KINGSTON. The deaths of traitors, If such have died within these gloomy towers, Should not appal your Grace with such vain terrors; The chamber is prepared where slept your Highness When last within the Tower. QUEEN. Oh! 'tis too good For such a wretchâa death-doom'd wretch as me. My Lord, my Henryâhe that call'd me forth Even from that chamber, with a voice more gentle Than flutes o'er calmest watersâwill not wrong Th'eternal Justiceâthe great law of Kings! Let him arraign meâbribe as witnesses The angels that behold our inmost thoughts, He'll find no crime but loving him too fondly; And let him visit that with his worst vengeance. Come, Sir, your wearied patience well may fail: On to that chamber, where I slept so sweetly, When guiltier far than now. Onâon, good Kingston. Whitehall. King Henry and Attendants. KING. 'Sdeath! ye're all traitors: the King's bed defiled, And by his grooms, and ye must pause and parley For proof and witness! Find me demonstration, Or I'll be law, witness, and judge. A King Not to cast off a wanton from his bed, But must be trammel'd, thwarted, check'd, control'd By quirks of law, old formal statutes, rolls Of parchment scribbled o'er with musty phrases! I'll let you know our will's this kingdom's law. Where's Norreys? ATTENDANT. He awaits your Highness' pleasure. KING. Come hither, Norreys: we have loved, have trusted youâ Could ye find out no nobler way than this Of being a traitor? could your daring lust Stoop to no humbler paramour than our Queen? NORREYS. Your pardon, Sire, but save your Highness' presence, Show me the man dare taint my name with treason, I'd dash my gauntlet in his face, and choke Th'audacious lie within his venomous throat. And more, excepting still my Liege's person, Whoe'er hath slander'd the Queen's honour, be it With me, or Knight far worthier of her favour, I do defy that man to mortal battle, Body to body, as a KnightâI'll prove him The most convicted, recreant, foulest slanderer, Whose breath e'er soil'd a Lady's spotless name! KING. Thou hast done us service, Norreys; for that reason, Though we impeach our honour by our mercy, Confess, if treacherous opportunity Or her too easy virtue did allure thee, (For in the heat and wild distemperature Of passion, noblest souls forget themselves). Be bold, be dauntless, but be true: we pledge The honour of a King, to give thee back Thy forfeit life; for look ye, she shall dieâ She and her minions!âStand thou forth our witness, Perchance, beside thy life, our grace may find Some meet return. NORREYS. I do beseech your Highness, What act of mine in all my life avouches The slanderous hope, to buy or life, or what I value more, my Sov'reign's gracious favour, I'd perjure mine own soul, accuse the blameless? My Liege, you are abusedâfoully abused! Some devil hath beset your easy ear. If you strike off this unoffending head, Your Majesty will lose a faithful servantâ That's soon replaced; but for the Queen, I say, And will maintain it with my life, the best, The chastest Queen, the closest nun in Europe, Is Messalina to a Vestalâ KING. Off! Away with him to the Tower.âWhat! have we stoop'd Thus to be gracious, to be scorn'd and rated, And by our slaves? The above. Winchester. KING. Why how now, Winchester? Another Churchman come t'impeach his King, And with mock charitable incredulity Arraign his justice? I'd but now a missive From Cranmer;âhe, forsooth, good blameless man, Knowing no sin himself, believes there's none In others.â'Sdeath! I'll hear no more excuses; The fact's as clear, or shall be, as yon Sun. Thou think'st her guiltless? GARDINER. Till this hour, my Liege, I could have pledged my life, sworn strongest oaths That such a monstrous sinâa sin that darkens The annals of mankind, makes us suspect Some moral plague broke out in human natureâ Had been impossible. Oh! best and greatest, That best and greatest to ungrateful men Should be a licence thus to wrong the bounties By which they lived!âAnd that the Queenâraised up From a Knight's daughter to the throne of Englandâ A partner of King Henry's bedâthe strange, Th'unnatural act doth give itself the lie! It doth out argue closest demonstration, And make us rather deem our senses traitors Than trust the assurance of most damning proofs. KING. Ha! proofs! GARDINER. Would there were none, my Liege, who bears Tidings of shame to an abused husband, That husband too a King, a glorious Kingâ Sire, my ungracious presence still will seem A base remembrancer of these foul deeds, Odious as theyâ KING. Your proofs, good Prelate, proofs. GARDINER. Is the confession of the guilty, forced By no stern tension of the searching rack, Nor laceration of the bleeding flesh, But free, unbribed, unsoughtâ KING. Ha! which? GARDINER. My Liege, 'Tis that outdoes all record of old crime, Makes true all tales of fabulous wantonness; It is the boyâthe beardless boy!âOh! lust, Blind as unbridled, frantic as impure, That no discrimination knows, nor choice Of base from noble, foul from fairâto fall From the allow'd embrace of such a Kingâ KING. Now, by St. Paul! thou wear'st our patience.âSpeak, How got ye this? look ye confirm it. GARDINER. Sire, May't please your Highness, that a holy Friar, Albeit I know your Grace for weightiest reasons Mistrusts their order, hath perpetual access Unto the prisoner Smeaton. KING. Ha! a priest I' the plotâwhy then 'tis ripe and pregnant. Gardiner, We are bound to thee. My Lord of Winchester, Look thou make good this charge against our Queen, Or, by St. Paul! thou shalt have cause to rue it. So, back to Greenwich; we'll go hunt the deer! Blow hornsâyell dogsâwe'll have a gorgeous day! The Sun is in the Heavens, and our high heart Is mounting with him. Offâto horseâto horse. The Tower. QUEEN. âBlessed are those that weep.ââOh! truth of truths, Not understood till feltâthou grace of Heaven, Spirit of Christ, thou didst not all forsake me, When my whole life was like a banquetâserved By Pride and Luxuryâdangerous cup-bearers. Prayers, all unwonted on the dainty couch, Where Queens are lapt in purple, fail'd not me; Mine heart, a place forbid to pain or sorrow, Thou didst incline to other's grief: I read In the deep lines of woe-worn cheeks, the bliss Of resignation to the Eternal will; And felt, admired, adored the Christian beauty Of graces that I had no scope to practise. But now, oh Christ! that thou vouchsafest me The mercy of afflictionâoh! the warmth Of prayer that burns upon my lips, the deep, The full religion that o'erflows my heart. My cited thoughts stand ready at my call, And undistracted memory ranges o'er My map of lifeâwhere it is wilderness Or weed-o'ergrown, pours streams of penitence; But where the sunshine of Heaven's grace, though cross'd By hasty clouds of earthly passion, gleams Upon the golden harvest of good deeds, It glorifies that Sun in humblest thankfulness. Thee, therefore, amiable prison, theeâ Oh! Solitudeâdreadful in apprehension; When present, to the friendless, the best friend! Henceforth will I esteem, as much beyond The pride and press of courts, as I feel nearer To Heaven within you. Queen, Cranmer. QUEEN. Good my Lord Archbishop, I will not wrong thee by the idle question Why here? 'Tis sorrow's dwelling, and thou art here But in obedience to thy heart and function. CRANMER. I come not, Lady, to erect anew The much misused Confessional, where Sins Best hid in shameful silence, or wrung forth In voiceless anguish, to Heaven's midnight ear, Are acted o'er again in foul recital:â But oh, if thou art fallen, the saintliest pupil In our young school of Christian graces, thou That to the living fountain of the Gospel Cam'st duly, to draw forth the eternal waters, What infamy will blacken o'er our cause. A horror of deep darkness hath oppress'd The Church, that waits in awful hope th'event. QUEEN. Cranmer, behold this book, my sole companion, Yet whose sweet converse makes my prison day So short, I'm fain t'encroach upon the night. Sir, were I guilty (and in truth I know My crime but vaguely), there's a passage here Of one detected in such nameless sin, That had been blotted with my scalding tears: 'Tis stainless, and in truth unread; nor ask I If my accusers are less deep in Sin. If I am guilty, let who will cast first The avenging stone, and heap the death upon me. CRANMER. Heaven's Grace be praised! but oh! the obdurate King. QUEEN. There's death in thy sad looks: speak, I'll endure it. He that has placed this cross upon my shoulders Will give me strength to bear it. I defy not, With boastfulness unfeminine, the shame, The agony; nor yet ungrateful speak As weary of a world only too full Of joyance. Thou, my child, would'st well rebuke Thy mother's selfish soul if she could leave thee Without a rending of her heart-strings: thou Not less, my mother! most of all, my husband! If unreluctant I could load thy soul With the foul crime of my judicial murder; Even our afflicted Church may ill sustain The loss of my unworthy aid. CRANMER. Oh! rate not Thus low your faithful service: farewell now Vain hope, that the whole land should hear the Word Of God go forth on all the winds; no more Fatigue the deaf cold Saint with fruitless pray'r, Or kiss with pilgrim lips the unheeding shrine: That not a village, not a silent hamlet In mountain solitude, or glen, of traveller Untrod, should want its sabbath bell to knoll To purest worship: that a holy priesthood, Chaste, simple, to themselves alone severe, Poor below luxury, rich beyond contempt, Environ'd with their heaven-led families, Should with their lives most saintly eloquence Preach ChristâChrist only:âwhile all reverend Learning In arch'd cathedral cloister, or the grove That bosoms deep the calm and thoughtful college, Should heavenward meditate, and bring to earth The knowledge learnt amid the golden stars. But now shall irreligious Avarice Pluck from his lips the Scholar's doleâthe Temples Lie desecrate in ruinâor the night Of ancient ignorance and error sink On the dark land for ever and for ever. QUEEN. Alas! Sir, why enamour me with life, Making me deem myself of value here, Here in this world, which I must leave?âSo young To be cut off, and so untimely! cast A blooming branch to the cold grave! Yet Heaven, Whose cause it is, will raise defenders up. My child! my daughter! oh prophetic soul! I dare not trust, yet will not disbelieve Thy glorious omens. Good my Lord Archbishop, Thou'lt not endure these knees should grow to earth, To less than Heaven; but I adjure thee, watch Her ripening spirit, sow the seed, ne'er lost Though cast on the waste waters. CRANMER. Heaven but grant The life and power! QUEEN. T'another subject now, My sins, my sins! CRANMER. Of them to Christ alone;â That heart bleeds freeliest that inly bleeds. QUEEN. Bear with me yet, my Lord, for I must tax Your kindness further. There is one, but one In all this world, my memory names, hath cause To think of me as of her enemy, The Lady Mary; for a dying woman Entreat her pardon. I've a letter here, Writt'n to the King with such poor eloquence As I am mistress of: beseech thee hear it; Then, if thou wilt, be thou the bearer of it. The Letter. This is little more than a versification of the celebrated letter; the authenticity of which Mr. Ellis appears to have established. âSire, your displeasure and imprisonment Are all so strange to me, that what to write I know not, what t'excuse: you sent erewhile Mine enemy to urge me to confess, And so secure your favour;âwillingly, If to confess a truth might purchase me My ne'er-despised safetyâbut imagine not Your wife will own a sin ne'er soil'd her thoughts. Never had Prince a wife so loyalâduteous, So to affection true, as your Anne Boleyn. That name and place had been my life's content, God and your Grace so willing it; yet ne'er Forgot I, that the fancy which had raised me, Might wander to another fairer object. You chose me, nor deserving, nor desiring, Your Queen and Partner:âhaving so honour'd me, Good, your Grace, let no light unworthy motive, Nor my malicious enemies' false council, Withdraw your favour from me, least the stain, Th'indelible stain of a disloyal heart, Attaint your duteous wife and royal daughter. Try me, good King, but with a lawful trial, Not with my foes my judgesâtry me openly; So shall my innocence shine forth as day, Your nice and jealous honour be absolved, Th'opprobrious voice of the world's slander silenced:â Or by the undoubted plainness of my guilt, Your Grace escape all censure of rash harshness, And God and man approve th'extremest rigour Of vengeance on a lawless wife:âthen freely Your Grace may follow that your heart's affection, Fix'd where I know, but where I may not name. But if my death, worse than my death, my shame, In your high councils is already doom'd, I make my prayer to God to pardon you, To blot this most unprincely usage of me From your account, when thou and I shall meet Before his judgment throne, where I shall stand, Judge howsoe'er the world, in saintly whiteness. I've but one more request; on me alone, If it must fall, fall all thy wrathâOh! touch not The innocent lives of those poor gentlemen In prison for my sake. If e'er thy wife Found favour in thy sightâif e'er thine ear Found music in Anne Boleyn's nameâdeny not This last, this dying prayer. No more I trouble thee. The Holy Trinity keep your good Grace In health, life, happiness, and holiness. Written from my doleful prison in the Tower, Your loyal and most faithful wife, Anne Boleyn.â CRANMER. God, that can make the marble heart like wax, Make this his instrument of grace! QUEEN. Amen. A Prison in the Tower. Angelo. ANGELO. Down, impotent remorse! temptation, down! My soul abjures thee! and thou, carnal pride, That wilt not use the means this world calls base For that great end, t'advance the faith of Christ! What if the span of some few mortal lives Be somewhat shrunk, some eyes untimely closed On this world's Sun, will not ten thousand souls Live through eternity's unfathom'd years, And a whole nation walk in moral light? 'Tis but the wise relentlessness of Heaven. Doth the dread earthquake feel remorse, that makes A populous city one vast tomb, where Guilt And Innocence lie side by side? Does Pity Pale the blue cheek of pestilence, that blasts Whole nations? Doth the sweeping deluge pause, And hold suspended its vast weight of waters, To give the righteous time to fly the ruin? The best, the wisest, holiest Saints and Pontiffs Have sent fierce war with undiscerning vengeance To waste the heretic's land; for though just Heav'n Turn from the field of carnageâfrom the city Made desolate, far rather it beholds them, Than the fierce tossings of the infernal pit, And Hell made rich with everlasting souls.â Here are but two; one guiltless, and one guilty. Onâand be fearlessâon, my soul! He sleeps; Poor wretch, thou'lt sleep ere long more deepâhe dreams. MARK, (in his sleep). Her voiceâher voiceâye heard her lute-like voice, Who loosed these bonds, who led me forth from death. 'Twas I, your servant, Iâ Where am I?âwho And what art thou?âThe Father Angelo! Oh! sleep, sweet sleep, art thou a prophetess, Or but a gracious and most kind deceiver? Oh! palace builderâoh! thou Queen of bridals, That in the silent prison mak'st the bells Sound for the jocund marriageâoh! magician, With realm of witchcraft wide as thoughtâtime, place, And circumstance, combine, and shift, and change, Like spirits on thy sorcerous wand that wait, And all things are that are notânight is day, Grief joy, death life, th'impossible becomes Breathing reality; thou dost take up Th'unpillow'd beggar, and dost proudly seat him Upon a throneâdost bring the Queen of queens Down to the level of a boy like me. ANGELO. Mark Smeaton, I am here to know thy purpose, Thy calm deliberate purpose: yet 'tis time To disavow thy dangerous evidenceâ Yet, but not long: I saw the Judges pass Across the court, and one that bare an axe Went first, as to denote they sate in judgment Upon a capital crime. MARK. Then she must dieâ If by mine oath she is found guilty, who Shall intercept that bloody instrument?â ANGELO. There has been stir and parleying to and fro Concerning a pre-contract, said to exist Between the Queen, when young, and the Lord Piercy; And wherefore this, but the relenting King Would be content to break the chain asunder That galls him. MARK. Yet to swearâbefore high Heavenâ All seeing Heaven!âHeaven, that in thunder spake The stern command, âThou shalt not bear false witness!â ANGELO. 'Tis well:âwhat is't to thee if the fierce King Add to his ruthless soul the crime of murder; And one unhousel'd heretic more bear down, Her soul all leprous with its gangrene taint, To burn for endless ages? I had brought The deposition, that but wants thy signet And oath before some witnesses that wait I' the court withoutâbut to the flames with it, And to the block with herânot worth the jeoparding The immortal spiritâ MARK. Not worth!âif'twere but death, To go to sleep in the cold grave, and know That she walk'd harmless in the living world. Oh! Sir, but Hell has some thrice darkest chamber, Some outcast dwelling, where the perjured hear The hissing and the execration of the damn'd. ANGELO. Crime is not crime but in its motive:âthou Art false but to be trueâfalse to her fame, True to her better interests.âBut I came not To argue. Yet when thou go'st hence, take heed Thou pass not o'er the hill where Traitors die; Lest trammel'd in the press, thou 'rt forced to see, From first to last, the hideous deedâthe stroke, The agony, the despair, the writhing hands, The sever'd neck, the cry to Heaven, that Heaven Shall turn away from, andâ MARK. Give me the paper; Let me not read it, lest its hideous falsehood Shake my faint resolution. Thereâ'tis done! ANGELO. What, ho! within,âye see this youth deliver This instrument as his own deed. WITNESSES. We do. ANGELO. Now in and sleep again. MARK. Sleep!ânever more; The perjured do not sleep; the slanderers, those That bear false witnessâyet Heaven knows, and Heaven Will pardonâand she too, like Heaven, will know, Like Heaven will pardon! Sir, I cannot think Thou hast deceived me; if thou hast, the tortures Of all eternity will be too short T'avenge this wicked subornation! ANGELO. Peace! MARK. Oh! pardon, Sir, my thoughts do swim so strangely; Things all so monstrous and incredible Have come to pass, there 's nought that seems too strange, And nothing is but what could never be. That thou, a man of such strict saintliness, Should'st be so false, finds credit with me only Because it is impossible, and far Beyond the reach and scope of our belief. A Hall in the Tower. Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, Marquis Exeter, and others as Judges. The Queen, and Officers. NORFOLK. Read our commission. OFFICER. Thomas Duke of Norfolk, The Duke of Suffolk, Marquis Exeter, Earl Arundel, and certain other peers Here present; ye are met in the Tower of London, By special mandate from the King, t'arraign Of certain dangerous and capital treasons Against the peace and person of the King Anne, Queen of England. CRIER. Come into the Court Anne, Queen of England. QUEEN. Here. OFFICER. Anne, Queen of England, (Be seated, it beseems your Grace's station,) Look on this Court, these peers of England, met, By the King's high commission, to pass sentence Between thyself and the King's Graceâhast ought T'object ere thou 'rt arraign'd? QUEEN. I'd thought, my Lords, It had stood more with the King's justice, more With the usage of the land, a poor weak woman Had not been forced t'abide your awful ordeal Alone and unadvised; that Counsel, learned In forms of law, and versed by subtle practice In forcing from the bribed or partial witnesses Th'unwilling truth, had been assigned me.âWell, Be't as it isâI have an advocate Gold cannot fee, nor circumstance appal; An advocate, whose voiceless eloquence, If it should fail before your earthly court, Shall in a higher gain me that acquittal Mine enemies' malice may deny me hereâ Mine Innocence. Proceed. OFFICER. Anne, Queen of England, Thou stand'st arraign'd, that treasonously and foully, To the dishonour of his Highness' person And slander of his issue, thou hast conspired With certain Traitors, now convict and sentencedâ George, Viscount Rochford, Henry Norreys, Knight, Sir William Brereton, Francis Weston, Knights, And one Mark Smeaton,â QUEEN. Pause, Sir; heard I rightly My Brother's name, Lord Rochford's? I beseech you, My Lords, what part bears he in this Indictment? OFFICER. The same with all the rest. QUEEN. Great God of Thunder Refrain thy bolt!âmy Lords, there are among ye Have noble Sisters, if ye deem this possible, I do consent ye deem it true. Go on, Sir. OFFICER. And one Mark Smeaton. QUEEN. Would they make me smile With iteration of that nameâa meet And likely lover for King Henry's Queen! NORFOLK. Read, now, the Depositions. Each and all, My Lords, ye have perused that dangerous paper Written by the Lady Wingfield, now deceasedâ Heard sundry evidence of words unseemly And most unroyal spoken by her Grace. QUEEN. The Depositions! good, my LordâI'd thought T'have seen my accusers face to face: is this The far renown'd and ancient English Justice? OFFICER. The Deposition of Lord Viscount Rochford:â That for th'impossible and hideous charge, His soul abhors it with such sickly loathing, Words cannot utter it: to stab the babe I'the mother's arms, to beat the brains from out A father's hoary head, had been to nature Less odious, less accurst. QUEEN. There spake my brother. OFFICER. The Deposition of Sir Henry Norreys:â That the Queen's Grace is as the new-born babe For himâfor others, he will prove her so In mortal combat 'gainst all England. Sir Francis Westonâdoth deny all guilt, With an asseveration, if in thought Or word he hath demean'd her Grace's honour, He imprecates Heaven's instant thunder-bolt. Sir William Breretonâif all women here In England were as blameless as her Grace, The Angels would mistake this land for Heaven. Mark Smeaton doth confessâ QUEEN. Confess! OFFICER. That twice In guilty commerce with the Queenâ QUEEN. My Lords, Who is it hath suborn'd this wretched boy? I do arraign that man, in the dread court Whose sentence is eternity! My soul Shall rise in judgment, when the Heavens are fire Around Christ's burning throne, against that man; And say on earth he murder'd my poor body, And that false swearing boy's lost soul in Hell. OFFICER. This full confessionâsign'd, and in the sight Of witnesses deliver'd, in due form Of law, in every part clear and authentic. NORFOLK. Anne, Queen of England, ere this high commission Pass to their final sentence, hast thou aught To urge upon their Lordships in defence Or palliation of these fearful charges? QUEEN. My Lords! th'unwonted rigour of the King And mine imprisonment have something shaken My constant state of mind: I do beseech you, If I speak not so reverently or wisely Of the King's justice as I ought, bear with me. I will not say, that some of you, my Lords, For my religion and less weighty motives, Are my sworn enemiesâ'twere to disparage The unattainted whiteness of my cause, That had defied the malice of the basest, Nor deigns mistrust the high-soul'd enmity Of English Nobles. When that I have forced you To be the vouchers for my honesty, My fame's pure gold shall only blaze the brighter, Tried in the furnace of your deadly hate! My Lords, the King, whose bounties, numberless And priceless, neither time nor harsher usage Shall ever raze from my heart's faithful tabletsâ The King, I say, took me an humble maid, With not a jewel but my maiden fame: That I'm his wife, seeing the infinite distance Between my Father's daughter and a throne, Argues no base or lowly estimate. Think ye a crown so galling to the brows, And a Queen's name so valueless, that false And recreant to the virtue which advanced me, I should fall off thus basely?âI am a mother, My Lords, and hoped that my right royal issue Should rule this realm: had I been worse than worst, Looser than loosestâthink ye I'd have peril'd The pride of giving birth to a line of Kings, And robb'd my children of their sceptred heritage? Your proofs, my Lords!âsome idle words, that spoken By less than me, had been forgotten air: The force of words dwells not on their mere letters, But in the air, time, place, and circumstance In which they're utter'dâthe poor laughing child Will call himself a King, will ye indite him Of treason? If less solemnly I've spoken Or gravely than beseem'd my queenly state, 'Twas partly that his Grace would take delight In hearing my light laughing words glance off, As is the wont in gay and courtly France:â Partly, that raised from such a lowly state Haply to fall again, I watch'd my spirit, Lest with an upstart pride I might offend The noble Knights whose service honour'd me. If thus I've err'd, through humbleness familiar, Heaven will forgive the fault, though man be merciless! To the rest, my Lords! knowing nought living dared Attaint my fame, my enemies have ransacked The Grave; the Lady Wingfield hath been summon'd To speak against me from her tombâand what?â Vague rumours! that I will not say base Envy (I'll have more charity to the dead than they To me), but pardonable error, zeal For the King's honour, may have swollen to charges, That if ye trust, not the shrined Vestal's pure. My Lords, my Lords, ye better know than I What subtle arts, what gilded promises Have been employ'd to make the noble Knights My fellow criminals, my Accusers! which Might not have purchased life by this base service, And crept into a late and natural grave? But let me ask, my Lords, which, base enough, And so disloyal, as t'abuse thus grossly The bounties of so good a King, had risen To this wild prodigality of honour, For a loose woman to lay down his head And taint his name, his blood, with infamy? For this besotted boy!âmy Lords, I know not If to rebut this charge with serious speech; Such as it is, my Lords, this modest beauty Made me a Queen, and other Kings disdain'd not To lay their flattering incense at its shrine. My Lords, there 's none amongst your noblest sons, Rich in ancestral titles, none so moulded By nature's cunning symmetry, so high In station, but my favour had endangered His truth t'his King:âand I, I that disdain'd Less than a crown, with wayward wantonness Demean me to a half form'd, base born slave!â I do demandâif that ye will not damn Your names to everlasting infamyâ Here, in this court, this instant, ye bring forth This boy: if with one word I force you not To do me justice on this monstrous slanderâ Do with me as ye will. I've done, and now Renew an old petition:âif the King, Abused and cheated of his wonted mercies, Hath sworn my death;âso order it, I pray you, That on my head alone fall all his wrath: Let these untainted gentlemen go free, And mine all honour'd Brother. Spare the King The anguish of unnecessary crime, And with less blood defile your own fair names. NORFOLK. Anne, Queen of England, first this Court commands You lay aside the state and ornaments Of England's Queen. QUEEN. As cheerfully, my Lords, As a young bride her crown of virgin flowers. NORFOLK. Prisoner, give ear! I, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, In name of all th'assembled Peers, declare The verdict of this court:âall circumstance, All proof, all depositions duly weigh'd, We do pronounce thee guilty of High Treason.â And, further, at the pleasure of the King, Adjudge thy body to be burnt with fire, Or thine head sever'd from thy guilty shoulders. QUEEN. Lord God of Hosts!âthe way! the truth! the life! Thou know'st me guiltless; yet, oh! visit not On these misjudging men their wrongful sentenceâ Shew them that mercy they deny to me. My Lords, my Lords, your sentence I impeach not; Ye have, no doubt, most wise and cogent reasons, Best heard perhaps in th'open court, to shame The wretched evidence adduced. My Lords, I ask no pardon of my Godâfor this Of which ye 've found me guiltyâto the King In person and in heart I've been most true. Haply I've been unwise, irreverent, And with unseemly jealousies arraign'd His unexampled goodness. This I say not To lengthen out my too protracted life, For God hath given, will give me strength to die. I'm not so proudly honest, but the grief Of my suspected chastity is gall And wormwood to me; were 't not my sole treasure, It less had pain'd me thus to see it blacken'd. My Lords, I take my leave:âupon your heads, Upon your families, on all this kingdom, On him who is its head and chiefest grace, The palm of Europe's sovereignty, may Heaven Rain blessings to the end of timeâthat most, And most abundant, his redeeming grace! A Prison. Magdalene, Mark Smeaton. MAGDALENE. Oh! Mark, Mark, Mark, to find thee here, and thus! Brother, that I should come to shame through thee! Through thee, my heart's one pride! I pray'd my way Through mocking men to find thee. Some did spurn me, Did almost void their rheum on me; and some Pitied me with more barbarous charity That I'm thy Sister; thou whom I had chosen Before the proudest Knight of all the Court. And thou must dieâall croak'd that in mine ear, The Ravens! All in drear accord.â MARK. Die! die! Oh! yesâthe solemn forms must be gone through, And the stern sentence read and register'd. And then!âoh then! what pride of rank, what distance Shall keep two branded criminals asunder? Oh! pardon me, that thus my selfish soul Rejoice in thy debasement: thou wilt know What I have risk'd, have suffer'd, all for thee. Oh! what 's the worldâits infamyâits prideâ To those that love? they 're their own world. MAGDALENE. Oh! Mark, Dear Mark, this dreadful prison, and the awe Of deathâthe guiltâoh! would I dared deny it; The guilt hath made thee frantic: not a word Hath meaning to mine earsâthou look'st on me, Not as a man condemn'd to die, with eyes All gleaming with a horrid joy. MARK. Thou, too, Thou only, Magdalene, shalt find free entrance To the retired garden of our joy. The above. Angelo. MARK. Oh! Father Angelo! is she set free? Where is she gone? may I yet follow her, And tell her with what violence to my soul I've forced and bow'd myself to crime to save her? ANGELO. She will be free anon; thou first. MARK. Dost say so? Now will I wait, and linger all unseen; And when the massy doors roll back, and slow The huge portcullis groans along its grooves, And down the drawbridge fallsâI shall behold her, Along the frowning files of gloomy archers, Come gliding like a swan on turbid waters. ANGELO. Deceive thyself no moreâI spake of freedom, For death it is that frees th'encumber'd spirit From the dark prison of this world; nor she Nor thou shall ever pass these iron gates, But to th'appointed stroke of death. MAGDALENE. Look, look! He cannot speak! he chokes, he shivers!âlook, He 's dying. Oh! already you have kill'd him. My Brother, wake! ANGELO. Oh! youth, whom Heaven hath chosen For its blind instrument to work the ruin Of its most deadly enemy, I'm come To fit thee for thy sacrificeâarise A Martyr to the glorious cause. I open The gates of Heaven before thy mounting soul. MARK. Devil! no man of God! unmeasured liar! My soul is sick at thee. Thou hold the keys Of Heaven, thou bloody wretch forsworn? thou worse, If worse can be than mine own perjured self, I spurn thee, curse thee, execrate thy faith And thee! ANGELO. Die, then! die lost, accurst for ever! Go with thy leprous soul unwash'd to Hell, To see what hideous torments wait on perjury. MARK. Avaunt! ANGELO. Weak boy and thankless, whom I've wrought To be a sharer in this great design; Were thine head crown'd, thy body rough with scars Won in the service of the Church, the joy And pride of nations waiting on thy footsteps, I'd trample on thy corpse with merciless heel, If o'er it lay my way to lift the throne Of Peter o'er the carnal Lords of earth. MAGDALENE. Oh! save himâsave him! I have heard thee speak In language that might melt the stoniest hearts; I've heard thee pray with such soul-kindling warmth Beside the bed of our departed Mother, That iron bonds had burst like flax before thee. ANGELO. It stands not in my power; but, oh! rash youth, Go not a rebel to the Church, to meet The Church's Lord:âkneel, I entreat thee, kneel; Let me not say I've slain thy soul; confess, Repent, and be absolved. MARK. Avaunt! away!â Wash thine own soul from thine own sins: kneel thou, Howl for thy crimes, thy treasons, and thy murders! And, if Christ give me power to pardon thee, 'Twill more avail thee in thy hour of need Than all thy formal conjuring absolutions. With herâwith herâthe gracious, good, and chaste, I'll take my everlasting portion; trust Even where she trusts; go where she goesâOh! no, My perjuries! my murders! when my soul Would rise to track the starlight path of hers, They'll hiss me, howl me down, down, down to blackness, To horror, now the element of my soul. ANGELO. The bell! It sounds for thee, it summons thee! I hear the trampling feet down the long galleries; The grating bolts fall back: kneel, kneelâthe Church Will pardon thy wild wordsâbe reconciled. MARK. Off!âI will have no share or portion with you. Think you your crimes and murders, ye, no Priests Of the great God of Truth and Holiness, Will not out-preach you from the face of earth: This air at length shall purify itself From your curst doctrines. ANGELO. Saints and Holy Angels, Hear not his blasphemies! but thee, my daughter, Will I bestow among some holy Sisters. MAGDALENE. With thee, my Brother's Murderer? thee, whose guile Has tainted his immortal soul with sin? Sir, I'm a weak and foolish maid; I know not The nice distinction of your rival creeds; But this I knowâ'tis not the faith of Christ, Of Christ the merciful, the sinless Christ, To guile an innocent youth to such a sin, And make a murderer of a heart had paused To take the meanest insect's life. Oh! Brother, Dear Brother, I will die with thee; they'll leave A corner in thy narrow bed where I May creep and hide my weary head. ANGELO. Be wise. MAGDALENE. Noâif I may not die, I'll starveâI'll begâ I'll serve the basest and most loathsome office, Ere owe my pittance to my Brother's murderer. ANGELO. They're hereâthey are at the door. MAGDALENE. Ah!â MARK. Peace, my Sister! Look you, I'm calm. I've hopeâbut not of life. I'll tell theeâhark! I will go forthâI'll stand Before the public eyeâand then and there I will undo the deadly crime I've done; Unswear what I have sworn, with such strange oaths That they perforce shall cancel their rash doom, And she shall live, and not quite curse my memory. Though their drums roll, and trumpets blare, I'll shriek The audible truthâand then I'll lay me down And take my quiet deathâmy quivering tongue Still murmuring of her slander'd innocence. And God shall give me grace not to denounce thee; Thou shalt live on, and eat thy heart to see Thy frustrate malice. Live, and still behold Man after man, and kingdom after kingdom, Fall from the faith that perjuresâmurders! Hark! They're hereâoh, Magdalene!âFarewell. MAGDALENE. Not yet, I'll not part yet; there's none to pray for thee But I; there's none to wind thy corpseâto weep, To die upon it. MARK. Call on Christ, my Sister, On Christ alone; cry loudly, fervently. They're hereâcome, come. MAGDALENE. Go on, I'll follow thee, Even to the brink, into the grave: go on; Till I am pluck'd perforce from thee, I'll follow. ANGELO (alone). Oh! thou that thrice denied'st the Lord of Life, Yet wert the Rock on which th'Eternal Church Was built, thou know'st, oh! Peter, that in zeal For thy soul-saving throne, against my nature, I've cast away this life. Oh! if thy servant Have ought deserved by this self sacrifice, Thou with thy powerful intercession stand Between his soul and endless burnings. Grant The Masses I will pay, while life is mine, May slake full soon the Purgatorial fires, And gales of Paradise come breathing o'er His rescued spirit. So on to death, poor youth, Not unabandon'd, not unwept by him Whose aid thou scornest now; but thou shalt own There, where all motives and all hearts are known. A Chamber in the Tower. QUEEN. Oh! Heaven! will they keep up this heavy din For ever, mocking me with hope, that now For me they're knollingâroll on roll and clash On clash!âOh! music most unmusical! That never soundest but when graves are open, And widows' hearts are breaking, and pale orphans Wringing their hands above a silent bier.â Four knells have rung, four now are dustâthou only Remain'st, my Brother! thou art kneeling now, Bare thy majestic neckâA pauseâmore long Than wonted; hath the mercy of the Kingâ The justice rather?âshalt thou rush again To our poor Mother's arms, and tell her yet She's not all childless?âStill no sound!âalas! It may be that the rapture of deep pity, And admiration of his noble bearing, Suspends all hands at their blood-reeking work, And casts a spell of silence o'er all sounds.â Ha! thou low-rolling doubling drumâI hear thee! Stern bell, that summon'st to no earthly temple! Thou'rt now a worshipper in Heaven, my brother, And thy poetic spirit ranges free Worlds after worlds, confest th'immortal kindred Of the blest angelsâfor thy heaven-caught fire, Still like that fire sprang upward, and made pure Th'infected air of this world as it pass'd. My childâmy motherâthey've forbidden me To see once more on earth your dear lov'd faces; There's mercy in their harshnessâhere's no place To entertain the future Queen of England, And God hath given me courage to keep down The mother in my heart; thou too, my parent, What hadst thou done but torn my heart asunder, And all distracted my calm thoughts of Heaven. Enter Sir William Kingston. QUEEN. Now all is o'er with those brave gentlemenâ They died, I know, Sir, as they lived, right nobly. KINGSTON. They gave their souls to their Redeemer, Lady, With protestations of your Highness' innocence, 'Twas their sole care and thought in death; they dared Heaven's utmost vengeance if they falsely swore. QUEEN. And that false youth, clear'd he our honour? KINGSTON. Loud He shrieked and struggled, not with fear of death, But with the burthen of some painful secret He would unfoldâthe rapid executioner Cut short his wailing. QUEEN. Most unrighteous speed! KINGSTON. Your Majesty's prepar'd? QUEEN. Oh! pomp of phrase, To tell a sinner to prepare for judgment; And yet, I think, Christ Jesus, through thy blood, I'm but about to change an earthly crown For one that's amaranth. There is no end Of the unexhausted bounties of the King: He made me first the Marchioness of Pembroke, Duchess of Dorset, then his sceptred Queen; And now a new advancement he prepares me, One of Heaven's angels.â Is it true, Sir William, You've brought from Calais a most dextrous craftsman In th'art of death?âhere's much ado, good truth, To smite asunder such a neck as this, My own slight hands grasp easily. Ye weep To see me smileâI smile to see you weep. I have no tears: I have been reading o'er His agony that suffer'd on the cross For such poor sinners as myself, and there Mine eyes spent all their moisture. KINGSTON. We rejoice To see your Highness meet your doom thus calmly. QUEEN. I am to dieâwhat's that?âwhy, thou and I And all of us die every night; and duly Morn to our spirits' resurrection comes With rosy light, fresh flowers, and birds' sweet anthems; But when our grave's our bed, that instant comes A morning, not of this world's treacherous light, But fresh with palms, and musical with angels. Oh! but a cruel, shameful, public deathâ There's no disease will let the spirit loose With less keen anguish than the sudden axe; And for the shameâthe sense of that's within! I've thoughts brook no communion or with that Or fear. My death the Lord may make a way T'advance his gracious purpose to this land: There'll be, will see a delicate timid woman Lay down her cheerful head upon the block As on a silken pillow; when they know 'Twas Christ that even at that dread hour rebuk'd Weak Nature's fears, returning home, they'll kneel And seek that power that turns our death to triumph.â Sir, are you ready?âthey'll allow me time To pray even there.âGo forward, Sir, we'll follow. The Scaffold. QUEEN. My fellow subjects, I am here to die! The law hath judged meâto the law, I bow. He that doth know all hearts, before whose throne, Ere ye have reach'd your homes, I shall stand tremblingâ God knowsâI've lived as pure and chaste as snow New fallen from Heaven; yet do not ye, my friends, Presumptuous judge anew my dangerous cause, Lest ye blaspheme against the wonted goodness Of the King's Graceâmost merciful and gentle I've ever known him, and if e'er betray'd From his kind nature, by most cogent reasons. Adore the hidden secrets of his justice As you would Heaven's. Beseech you, my good friends, If in my plenitude of power I've done Not all the good I might, ye pardon me:â If there be here to whom I've spoken harshly Or proudly, humbly I entreat forgiveness. âNo, Sir, I'll wear no bandage o'er mine eyes, For they can look on death, and will not shrink. Beseech you, Sirs, with modesty unrobe me, And let my women have the decent charge Of my poor body. Now, God bless the King, And make his Gospel shine throughout the land!</field>
