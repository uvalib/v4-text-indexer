      <field name="fulltext">An Epistle to Archdeacon Nares. From shores, whose solitude no brother shares, I raise my voice to thee, ingenuous Nares!— Far off, as if alike thine ear to reach From Hecla's ashes, or Cornubia's beach! If Maro Penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos. lyed not, our whole Isle was hurl'd— Aye—tost beyond the limits of the world! Remote from every Muse's genial smile, Buried amidst the billows was our Isle!— Struck off from life by some unlucky blow, Such Britain was, two thousand years ago! For his own Fame's, the Mantuan's trump may pass Tam ficti tenax quam nuncia veri.— But is not Cornwall now, what Britain was? In sooth, the dark Bolerium—(so to me It seems) is half-abandon'd to the sea! Here, if my harp, lone wanderer! I uplift, Rapt into song, from creek, or carne or clift, To the sad echo of the rock scarce rings One weak note, tremulous, from the dripping strings; Whilst gay Augusta bids the numbers rise That with responsive bosoms symphonize; Thro' golden portals guides the sacred march; And her heaven opens in a wider arch! Here, from these russet moors, those granite hills, These vales that sicken to polluted rills, Each Naïd as the poisoning mineral scares, And sigh thro' chasmy dells the summer-airs— Here, where, along the horizon's lurid verge, Whitens with restless foam the Atlantic surge; Say, shall the Muse her madrigals send forth— Her dulcet strains, to calm the blustering North? E'en now, tho' Maia from her cloud, serene, Bends in soft whispers o'er thy gentler scene, Nor from a dreary depth of darkness lours, But mild on grove and meadow melts in showers, Here Eurus sails around, and, wild and harsh, Sweeps the pale upland and the sedgy marsh: The broom, the fainting heathflowers floods o'erwhelm; The scath'd oak whistles to the stunted elm! Yes! the sod smokes!—the rain descends in sheets! Here, flash'd the lightnings—there, a sunblaze fleets! I see yon mill the sudden rays refract— Flares, like a torch, its wintry cataract! The huge clouds into fragments break! And, hark! It is the sea-gull's dirge!—The quivering lark Is mute. The martin, that had skimm'd, aloof, The unpeopled air, distrusts the friendless roof, And disappears: Nor vernal notes relieve The dun cold tenour of the untinted eve. True—we have rocks, whose Druid frowns sublime Give fancy to fling back the folds of time— The massy Logan-stone, Immense as the superincumbent rock may be, it has been, in some instance moveable by a rod. to hazel-rod Trembling; tho' it might seem by demigod Immoveable—the shaggy black Carnedde I know several composed of black iron stone, and shaggy with moss. That summons up the visionary dead! True—we have castles, where in solemn trance Uncurtain'd rise the Merlins of romance— Valour's plumed helm, and beauty's witching glance! True—we have ships, and wrecks that in the roar Of waters, hurried to our shelvy shore, With drowning seamen and their struggling cries Suave mari magno.— May feast poetic ears—poetic eyes! Ah! what are tones, from lute or lyre, to greet The crowd, tho' as Æolian breathings sweet!— The music, where is no melodious ear— The plaintive ditty, which provokes a sneer? Oh! I may fly, and none will heed my flight, From Carnbre's cromlech to Brownwilley's height, And, as I warbled once in boyish strain, Invoke the genii of the carnes again! Oh! I may roam thro' caverns scoop'd on high, And heave, unanswer'd, sigh succeeding sigh— The sea-scoop'd caverns, fit for moody minds To chaunt, unheard in, to the waves and winds! Far other is thy lot, my friend! to hail The umbrageous forest and the purple vale— The beech, whose silky shadow breathes repose, As in full pride its summer foliage flows— Rich in its floral dress, the extensive lawn; And, far within its cradling wood, withdrawn, Cool from a mossy bank the fountain-stream, And light fawns frisking round its amber gleam: —To greet, where rosy-wreath'd the Graces dance Link'd with the Loves, thy Lichfield's elegance: To wing to Heaven devotion's incense-fire, Where in Cathedral-state thy towers aspire. The humble Vicar of Newlyn has presumed to address this familiar Epistle to the “Canon Residentiary of Lichfield and Archdeacon of Stafford.”—But it is an Epistle, he trusts, to a sincere friend. Yet o'er an ampler space expand thy views; To brighter prospects points the enamour'd Muse: And of her classic train to science won, In thee Augusta courts her favourite son, Thy wit applauds, good-humour'd, sparkling, chaste, And bows, respectful, to thy critic taste. O LONDON! how I love—how hate thy name! O London! Britain's glory, Britain's shame! But to her own elect, hath wisdom giv'n To seek, thro' storm, the halcyon breath of heaven! And sure, 'tis heaven, where wit to virtue lends Its lamp, and liberal converse lights up friends; And learning opes to emulative youth The tomes of ancient honour, candour, truth, And knowlege that not dazzles but endears, The prop, the solace of declining years! What tho' on the shy Muse the Town obtrudes The murmurs and the tramp of multitudes; Tho', in the eternal tide, the alert, the grave, Riches and rags roll on, wave urging wave, Fluctibus in mediis, and tempestatibus urbis. Tho' in the conflict meditation reels, Stunn'd by the dizzy whirl—the din of wheels, Strepitusque rotarum. And, mingle amidst crashes, screams and jars, Dandies and tilburies, parasols and cars; Tho' feverish revelry usurps the night, And ball-room brilliance mocks the morning-light;— Say, is not Europe sedulous to share Treasures, uncounted treasures, glittering there? And shall we not press on, thro' humming streets, And cull, discreetly cull, “selectest sweets”? Say, do we view that universal mart— That central spot of science and of art, Those high-bred circles, fashion's prime resort, All the fine effluence of a polisht court, And Brunswick's mildness, which o'er warlike toils, Triumphal banners and barbaric spoils Hath shed its animating ray, once more In splendour to eclipse an Azincourt,— Now pleased to give, in this domestic calm, To letter'd worth its purer, nobler palm;— (There, if the Muse her faultless forms dispense, And modern grace meet old magnificence);— —Without the intenser thought, that spurns controul From every vulgar object, and the soul From gross—from mean mortality abstracts, Despising clamours, clarions, routs or racks, Or bids it smile on all the world beside, And to itself return with conscious pride? In such a scene if kindred spirits unite, Behold, in each pursuit, keen appetite— In every aspiration daring thought; Each work still nearer to perfection brought; A lustrous finish in the Historic line, In fancy the Promethean spark divine. Whilst some from chance assemble—from caprice— Whilst wit—while talents little of a piece, Purpureus pannus. And studiousness and skill, and Taste correct, The pliant soul, the strong rough Intellect, Pertness amid sterility of brain, And Fancy of its crude conceptions vain, Light airiness, a mind reserv'd and close, A drowsy dull complexion comatose, Invention quick, and efforts operose, The Passion, that betrays abundant bile, The habitual simper, and the specious smile, And envy, to destroy a rival's fame That shoots its arrows with insidious aim, And Ridicule that leers and laughter flings, Arm'd at all points with sly satiric stings— While such, with principles to effervesce, To fume or flame, would vainly coalesce— Whilst, feeble from disease or fast decay, They fret and vapour out their poor short day;— 'Tis yours, who rear on adamantine base The column'd strength of grandeur and of grace, Those eminent booksellers, the Hatchards, in Piccadilly, were honoured (and deservedly honoured) by the first meetings of “The Royal Society of Literature.” The Society have now Apartments in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. And thro' your Dome as sunlike Glory streams, In regal goodness bless the auspicious beams;— 'Tis yours, by no low partial biass bent, To give free scope to high-soul'd sentiment; Dejected merit to its place to raise, And cheer young genius in its rude essays,— As sweet esteem excites its trembling fires, And the head sanctions what the heart inspires. But say, if friendship feel—if candour think; If selfishness in social union sink; If all tend equal to the common weal; And Virtue to the compact fix her seal; Their bands, to Learning where her sons incline, Their silken bands with flowers if Pleasure twine;— Precarious is their life—a progeny Tho' fair in promise, only born to die Where no kind Patron rivets every tie— Fraternal spirits that flutter and expire, Where fed—where shelter'd by no fostering Sire. Ah! such, while temperance quaff'd the enlivening bowl, “The feast of reason, and the flow of soul”— Such, whilst thy genius, Pope! transcendent shone, Such, while the world of wit was all thine own! But genius fades, an evanescent flame; And wit must perish with our mortal frame! Of course, in conversation. And oral wit, it is conceived, is fugitive enough, whether with or without a Patron. But, under the wings of Princes, the ???? ????????? will be generated more rapidly, will shine more brilliantly, and will have a better chance of being perpetuated as transmitted from one set of men to another, their certain successors:—the ????? ??? ??? of the establishment. And, for composition, it will always acquire strength and splendour from emulation fostered by patronage. Such were the moral Johnson's festal hours— The rich—the titled—all revered his powers! Then kindred talents, in collision blazed; And candour censur'd, admiration prais'd! 'Tis past! That loftier tone of life is fled— And all lie number'd with the silent Dead;— Save a choice A chosen few, providentially permitted to remain a little longer upon earth —to shew the present generation what Knowlege is, as contrasted with Philosophism. —Simplicity with Affectation,—Benevolence and Candour with caustic and unfeeling Criticism.—In correcting the prevailing errors in Philology and Taste, the influence of the Royal Society of Literature will probably be found beneficial beyond all calculation. few, who, hovering yet below, On friendship lost a tear of love bestow!— Save a choice few, who, lingering yet behind, Perhaps, “with many a feeling too refined,” The haunts of cordial joy would fain explore, And mourn the shadow of those haunts no more; Pursue their phantom thro' the trophied gloom, And chase a shivering glimpse from tomb to tomb! Of the celebrated Literary Club in Gerard-Street, which consisted of forty-four noblemen and gentlemen of high station in rank and learning, two only survive—Earl Spenser and Lord Stowell. And of the Essex-Street-Club (thirteen of whom attended Johnson's funeral) three only are now living—Mr. Nichols, Mr. Chamberlain Clark, and Mr. Jodrell. 'Tis yours, my Friend!—tho' not the patronage Of Princes, can give back to torpid age Its buoyant lightness and its brisker blood, Or brace, with nerves anew, decrepitude; Tho' if, alas! a cankering blight consume The morning freshness of the mental bloom, Not for a little moment, sceptred sway Can rescue genius “snatched too soon away;”— 'Tis yours, conspicuous above all, to trace Perennial Truth, in race that follows race, To welcome those who “build the genuine rhyme,” Thro' fame's broad vista, fair in future time! And when, in many a harmonist, the fire Of Inspiration shall have waked the lyre, When he whose pencil drew “Remorse” so well, In tragic painting shall himself excell; When darker ages, from the Historian bright, Like “golden Leo's,” shall spring forth to light, And a new flush of elegance restore To former credit antiquarian lore; Another Coleridge shall his Albion charm, In fancy fertile, in affection warm; Again Mathias win the critic's prize, And other Turners—other Roscoes rise. From the “Ten Royal Associates,” Coleridge, Mathias, Turner and Roscoe are by no means invidiously selected. The author is not aware, that “the Ten are not equally worthy of the high distinction which they enjoy. Yet, darting into dim futurity, We can discern, at most, with aching eye, An image indistinct of Time gone by!— 'Tis but the same, less lovely to the sight, The Past reflected in a fainter light! And sweet if Memory's tints the Past pourtray, How pleasant to recal our Classic day; To court, once, once again, the Aonian maids O'ercanopied in Academus' shades; To bound in transport to the brightening view— To bound in transport, as when life was new! Thee, The Right Hon. William Wyndham,—Lord Grenville, D. C. L.—F. R. S.— F. A. S.—Chancellor of the University of Oxford.—His lordship is here introduced as of Christ Church, Oxford, and as of the Council of the Royal Society of Literature. Grenville! in those seats of science nurst— O thou, of Academus' sons the first— Thou, to whose care we see the willing Nine In recent state their edifice resign In Leicester-Fields.— Accomplisht Wyndham!—thee did Learning call With kindling eye, to Wolsey's pictur'd hall, And bade the meanest of her votaries join In cloystral shade his orisons with thine, And speed him to theatric pomp, where round In cluster'd rows, the electrifying sound That issued from thy tongue, thrill'd every soul, And pæans of applause burst forth as thunders roll And Memory pencils (nor her touch deceives) The very sun-tint that illumed the leaves, Bishop Burgess, President of “the Royal Society of Literature.” above is a picture, exact from memory. O Burgess! when down Christ-Church avenue My quickening steps thy silver tassel drew! Immortal Burgess! well had Heaven decreed A mitre for thy more distinguish'd meed! Yet tassels idly glisten—mitres fade! The unwithering crown of life shall gird thy head! So flourish'd, to inspire the laureate theme, In orient light, the groves of Academe! Elms! that o'erarch'd a Bagot! Bagot, Dean of Christ Church. I revere Your sacred glooms, to many a friendship dear! Nor the proud discipline, that mark'd the Dean Cyril Jackson, Dean of Christ Church. Of “sterner stuff,” could disenchant your scene; Nor he, my equal, Hall, Dean of Christ Church, of the same standing, to a day, with the writer of this Epistle—in this sense, his “equal.” of more placid port Warm'd by whose wing, how numerous the resort Of Alma's tribes! I ponder'd on the fires Of fervent youth; nor sons disgraced their sires!— Elms! that majestic rise, as erst ye rose, Shall not your shades, above the rest, disclose An ACLAND, Sir T. D. Acland, Bart. gentleman commoner of Christ Church, a member of “the Royal Society of Literature,” and of their “Council,” and possessor of that venerable mansion, Trerice, in this parish of Newlyn—a happy coincidence of circumstances and situations, to the writer of this Epistle; which, after his excursive views of Lichfield, London and Oxford, restores him to his own County, and his own parish, and at the same time brings the Epistle to a just conclusion. blazoning with the o'erpassing fame Of worth and talents, his escutcheon'd name? Shall we not hail him, emulous to shed New From the new Institution of “the Royal Society of Literature.” radiance around London's See Milton's L' Allegro— “Towred cities please us then,” and in his “Lib. Eleg.” “turrigerum caput,” as applied to London. The lines, where this expression occurs, discover Milton's strong attachment to the city.— “Tuque urbs Dardaniis, Londinum! structa colonis Turrigerum late conspicienda caput, Tu nimium felix intra tua mænia claudis Quicquid formosi pendulus orbis habet.”— See Warton's Milton, Edit. ii. pp. 429, 430. “towred head;” Or raptur'd midst his woods and waterfalls, Or generous in his hospitable halls, Where Devon spreads her combes, or swells her vales, And here, where Cornwall braves the westering gales; Here, where, the wayworn minstrel to entice To mantling cups, once bloom'd his old Trerice. On those sweet bowers have favouring monarch's smiled— Those bowers—for Cornwall is not all—a wild! And if my Sovereign, with no scornful eye Far in this solitude my walks descry; 'Midst those gray turrets, he may fling, perchance, On “the lone wanderer,” one regretful glance— A humble Vicar, yet perhaps too proud, Not prone to mingle with the ignoble crowd, Who tunes, in deep accord, the heroic strings To his hoar fathers, much attach'd to Kings! Always remarkable for their fidelity to their Kings. To Charles I. they sacrificed a very large part of their patrimony:—of which the remnant, in the hands of the writer of this Epistle is held chiefly under the Duke of Cornwall. And, whether to the Duke, the Prince or the King, his fourteen children have been carefully taught allegiance, and have imbibed loyalty, from precept and example, an hereditary principle. Nor haply will my gracious Liege Visitor of Christ Church, Patron of “the Royal Society of Literature,” and Duke of Cornwall. disdain The last-left harp in all the “pensive plain”— A harp, to rouse—tho' democrats deride The Poet's zeal, his Cornwall's honest pride— The pride which circles round her PRINCE's throne, And claims, with patriot-warmth, that PRINCE, her own! Scotland has its representative in “a Royal Associate:” So hath Wales. And Cornwall (which with the zeal of the men of Israel) would exclaim— “we have ten parts in our King”—may, one day, perhaps, boast of “a Royal Associate,” when the writer of this Epistle shall be gathered to his Fathers.
