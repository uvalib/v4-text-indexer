      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. THE VISIONS, AN ELEGY. This Poem was written on the terrace walk of the Palace garden at Lichfield, soon after the death of the Author's only sister, who died at 19, on the eve of her intended marriage. This, and all other Poems of this Collection marked; were written between the age of 17 and 23. With languid step and heart by sorrow torn, Haunt of my youth, I wander thro' thy grove, My loved Alinda's fate incessant mourn, And drop my blighted garlands as I rove. Yet e'en these rankling woes some respite find, And on the smiling landscape sooth'd I gaze, Where joy's wild music cheers the drooping mind, As Nature's warblers swell the song of praise. The blooming trees bend o'er the glassy stream, In June's gay pride they wave their flowing heads; While, from the setting sun, a golden gleam O'er these green fields the soften'd radiance sheds. But ah! behold the transient glories fly, And on the fair horizon steals a cloud, A few cold drops fall from the louring sky, And mute the plumy warblers, late so loud! What means this sudden damp—this awful gloom, This more than usual presage of the soul? All things are silent as Alinda's tomb, All but the death-bell's melancholy toll! From the rent earth why starts that horrid shade? O! from its power my shrinking spirit save! Why thus in dread funereal garb array'd, The shroud,—the pall,—the vestments of the grave? O'er the wan brow the shadowy crape is bound, And withering flowers in mournful wreaths are twined, That willows, yew, and cypress buds surround, With dark, warp'd leaves unfragrant and declin'd. Her cheek all bloodless, and all dim her eye, With hollow tone, she cries,—“Behold Despair! “She bids thee ceaseless heave th' heart-rending sigh, “And shed eternally the bitter tear. “A glowing sun, in Summer splendour gay, “Soft gales, that scatter fragrance as they rove, “The beauteous flowers, that drink the humid ray, “'Mid the wild transports of the vocal grove, “Have they a charm for thee?—and still remains, “Deep in thy breast, fond joy's congenial tide? “Springing at Beauty's glance and Pleasure's strains, “Do her bright streams thro' Sorrow's mansion glide? “See'st thou this rose? its gay, its crimson glow “Faded and gone, and all its fragrance fled! “This sullied lily, once, with breast of snow, “Was the chaste glory of its verdant bed. “Yet this the lily, this the splendent rose “Alinda gather'd on her jocund way, “When her fair cheek could rival bloom disclose, “When her eyes beam'd with health's enlivening ray. “Beneath this shade she cropt the glowing flowers, “Herself a fairer flower,” that Death has cropt, “From this lov'd bank, where oft, in happy hours, “She raised each stem whose sickly blossom dropt. “Mark'd every charm of Nature's varying year, “Of Fancy's lucid orb each hue refined, “And all that lifts the spirit, warm and clear, “High o'er th' inert, the common mass of mind. “Where is she now?—within the narrow cell, “Pale, cold, and sunk, she lies in dread repose! “Then, Julia, bid thy joys a long farewell! “Young as thou art, in youth's gay hours they close.” I hear no more;—the spectre's hollow tone Sinks in the wind that howls along the glade, And darkness o'er its ghastly form has thrown, Gloom following gloom, impenetrable shade. Cold as the falling dews, tear chasing tear, Streams on my folded hands!—yet I remain, Transfix'd with anguish at the doom severe, While night and horror gather on the plain; Silent and mournful has the lingering hour Beheld me plunged in Sorrow's deadly dreams; But now, while soften'd winds forget to roar, On a cloud's edge the star of evening beams; And now, emerging, all the stellar fires Light the dark cope, as with unnumber'd eyes; Yet soon, before night's ample orb, retires Each lesser glory that illumes the skies. Circled with shadowy hills the grassy vale, The Vale of Stowe, which slopes down from Lichfield Cathedral. Thro' plenteous dews, shines silver'd by her light, While the embosom'd lake, beneath the gale, Reflects her lustre, tremulously bright. Ah see! a form, than yon full orb benign Of lustre more benevolent appears! And, as she glides from an o'ershadowing pine, My earnest eyes dispense their gathering tears. “To the meek words of Patience listen calm, “Lone child of Sorrow,” the kind vision cries; “Receive on thy pierced heart my healing balm, “And to my voice attune thy soften'd sighs! “Wiltthou from Heav'n receive the nectar'd draught “Of bliss, yet start if in the mingled bowl “Rise the alloying griefs that fate has brought, “Commission'd from above, to wean thy soul? “Medicinal, tho' sharp, the blended woe.— “Thou, who hast been most happy, bow resign'd! “For man no more unfading roses blow, “Winter lays waste his year, and grief his mind. “But Heav'n, that sends abroad the breath of Spring “T' expand the foliage, and disclose the flowers, “Shall to the sorrowing mind sweet comforts bring, “And warmly renovate its fainting powers. “Two sister-handmaids to the Will Divine, “For this blest purpose, quit the seraph train; “Thro' me, thro' Patience, first its mercies shine; “O gently listen, and no more complain! “Yield to my influence, my behests obey, “So shall the lenient hand of Time to thee “Lead pious Cheerfulness, fair child of day, “Whom the Dread Voice has bade succeed to me. “Again her comforts shall thy breast pervade, “Tho' clouds of sorrow have eclipsed their ray, “And she will chace each dark and deadly shade, “Till life's fresh paths shall brighten on thy way. “Thy soul, humiliated, now feels and mourns “The tarriance short of giddy joy below; “But guard thee well, when jocund she returns, “Against the meteor-fires that round her glow. “To many a dangerous path those fires shall lead, “While through luxuriant scenes with thee she roves, “Where snares for Innocence infest the meads, “Circean-banquets rise, and syren-groves. “Stain'd is the spirit, following Luxury's lure, “Cold is the heart, by earthly pride made hard, “And 'gainst the cold, the thankless, and impure, “The everlasting gates of bliss are barr'd. “While to the kind, warm heart, resign'd sedate, “The blooming wreaths of happiness are given, “For peace on earth and joys immortal wait “Good-will to Man and confidence in Heaven.” Now melts the vision in the moon's pale beam, And o'er my soul serener thoughts arise, Grief prompts no more her ineffectual stream, And swell no longer her convulsive sighs. But let me haste the deeper woes to sooth, That press so hard on life's declining years, With filial fondness sedulously smooth My parents' thorny pillow, steep'd in tears. The bridal vestments waited to array, In emblematic white, their duteous maid; But ne'er for them arrived that festal day; Their sweet, crush'd lily low in earth is laid. O! she was all parental Hopes desire, To gild declining life with softest light; Ill can my frailer mind's impetuous fire Compensate her mild soul's eternal flight! And yet, on their lone couch, this heart sincere, With tender love, shall shed some bless'd relief, Watch for the moment when its voice may cheer, And joy to mark the ebbing tide of grief. And young Honora, Miss Honora Sneyd, since Mrs Edge- worth, the daughter of Edward Sneyd, Esq. She was adopted by Mr and Mrs Seward, and educated in their family. In her 18th year she became the object of the brave, unfortunate Ma- jor André's unalienable attachment. in each rising charm Of form and mind, the pious task shall aid; O! like their loved Alinda, soft and warm, Glows this transplanted flower that decks their shade. Scarce o'er her head are thirteen summers flown, Yet clear intelligence, unswerving truth, And every soothing sympathy, have thrown Meridian lustre o'er her morn of youth. And dost thou stretch, dear maid, those gentle arms, Smile through thy tears, in pity's hallow'd guile? Shield me, my love, from woe's o'erwhelming harms, Thy tears are balm, and peace is in thy smile. Thy tender accents, on my grief-chill'd soul Fall, like the vernal breath on wintry bowers, When, from the fleecy clouds, that lightly roll, Silent and mild descend the sunny showers. And since in Thee, to every worth alive, The sacred energies of Friendship burn, Thy love, my dear Honora, shall revive The joys that faded o'er Alinda's urn. (j.) KNOWLEDGE, A POEM IN THE MANNER OF SPENCER. Is there a joy that gilds our stormy days, For which the soul of man so much should pine As heaven-born Knowledge? Yet her sacred rays Are as the diamond's, and by art must shine; The latent beams more exquisitely fine In some of highest worth, yet all require Industrious care, or lost the light divine Ordain'd to wake each elegant desire That shall to all that's fair, and great, and good aspire. While yet unknown the principles of art, Impervious veils must shroud its radiance clear; When sluggish ignorance surrounds the heart No lustres can pervade the darkness drear, But all as colours to the blind appear; Where Pleasure's tint, celestial, rosy red, Majestic purple, scarlet, hue of war, The undulating mantle of the mead, And Heaven's gay robe, a dark, unmingled mass is spread. There glows in man a principle innate, Of powerful bias, which to good, or ill, Low, or exalted, must direct his state, And one fixed purpose of the soul fulfill, As early choice, to habit grown, shall will; If, like the lark that mounts the orient beam, His wing he not expand, aspiring still To Wisdom's sun, whence light and beauty stream, He sinks in murky caves, where owls and ravens scream. Youth is life's spring, the seed-time, when the mind Fosters each new idea planted there; If we neglect to sow the grain refined, No future pains can raise a harvest fair; And memory, warm and soft in early year As yielding wax, disused, grows cold and hard, Nor aught retains of each impression rare, Which, when retain'd, acquire the high reward Bestow'd by star-crown'd Fame on timely studious bard. Mild Sensibility, whose trembling light Has rarely fail'd to shine in youthful breast, Resisted, chill'd, withdraws her influence bright, From the dull spirit, in its stagnant rest; She flies!—and with her flies each lovely guest, From her deriving all their noblest powers, Genius and Truth, in sun-gilt mantle drest, Love, Friendship, Pity, all that speed the hours, And strew the path of life with ever blooming flowers. PORTRAIT OF MISS LEVETT. Then of Lichfield, and afterwards wife of the Rev. Richard Levett. This picture, in verse, was drawn by the author at eighteen. Tho' lovely Stella's pleasing features show Nor Phydian symmetry, nor Titian glow, Yet Mind imparts, their transient charms to foil, Life to her glance, and magic to her smile. When serious tender, and when gay serene, Consummate elegance in all her mien, To her the youth from vaunted beauty flies, And for the Graces, in their favourite, sighs, They, in the very ribbons that o'ershade Her lively brows, her auburn tresses braid, Infuse, with playful spirit, all their own, The power resistless of the Cyprian zone. Her dress, her air, her accent to attain, See emulative fair-ones strive in vain! While sires and matrons in attention vie, And watch the rising archness in her eye. E'en envious maids, in life's deserted wane, Look half as pleased as if beloved again; Lose, as they listen, all their sullen cares, Remit their scandal, and neglect their prayers. Round the grave Scholiast as her spirit plays, Behold him chace it thro' its brilliant maze, And, sexual pride subdued, at length disown The Salique Law for Wit and Fancy's throne! (j.) ELEGY ADDRESSED TO CORNET V?, IN THE AUTUMN 1765. Ere yet thou seek'st Ierne's jocund shore, Pensive I wave this tributary lay; Confess thy Julia must the fate deplore, That soon shall lead thee o'er the wat'ry way. Tinged with no blush, she boasts herself thy friend, That gentle name, from dangerous wishes free! Yet will no merit from the boast pretend, For who, who would not be the friend of thee? While youth and bloom, and dignity combine, All that can interest, all that can adorn, To manly grace attempering softness join, Life's noon-tide lustres in her orient morn. The lights of intellect around thee thrown, Thy modest virtues every where the theme!— Strange, if the coldest maid should blush to own Desert so high awakes her owed esteem. Love's fairy visions for a while are gay, A little, little while, when they are new, But soon the sweet enchantment fades away, Transient as summer morn's exhaling dew. Ah, then approach a throng of secret woes, To faithless hope the varied pang succeeds; The thorny pillow banishes repose; The wounded heart inevitably bleeds. Yes, bleed it must, and bleed at every vein, When the pale brood, of Disappointment born, Attendants oft on Love's tyrannic reign, Teach the lost maid her living death to mourn. If my presaging soul aright divine, Such the sad lot I am ordain'd to prove, Should I, rash votary at that dangerous shrine, Receive the rose-deck'd chains of guileful love! No wreaths of amaranth he weaves for me, Then guarded rise my gay, my youthful hours! Calm be my thoughts, my artless bosom free From the sharp thorns of transitory flowers! But, happier amity, pervade my breast, With tranquil empire, thro' these vernal years, While, in Horatio's trusting friendship blest, Mine his prosperity, and mine his cares. This sympathizing heart implores the task To sooth thee, drooping in thy native clime; Give then the precious confidence I ask, The tender records The author had heard, and be- lieved, that her friend was attached, at the time this poem was written, to a young lady at Angiers. of the vanish'd time! My pitying spirit shall partake thy pains, And griefs divided lose their power to blight; Watch the lone sigh, that steals to Gallia's plains, Where Beauty mourns thy much unwilling flight. Ah! pale no more thy star of love should gleam, Could my soul's wishes its soft orb command, But point in purest light each languid beam, And on the azure zenith shining stand. O! may unblemish'd Honour guard thy fame, And plumy Conquest triumph on thy sword; Thine be each meed the milder virtues claim, Health, Peace, and Plenty, hand-maids of thy board! When ardent Youth, and rosy Love are flown, O! e'en thy graces cannot bribe their stay! As Joy had brighten'd in thy radiant noon, May soft Contentment gild thy closing day! And when thou soarest from these veering spheres, From busy Life, and from its silent bourne, Thine be the bliss, that change nor period fears, In the blest regions of the nightless morn. (j.) THE HAY-FIELD, A MORNING SCENE. The joys, gay Spirit of the social plain, And useful labours, renovate my strain, Rising, it vibrates to thy oaten reed, And sings the artless pleasures of the mead. No frown the Muse from Truth and Nature fears, Tho' pale Refinement sicken as she hears. Now is it June's bright morn, and Beauty twines The glowing wreaths that deck her thousand shrines; On the lark's wing, sweet music hails the day, And o'er the sun-beam pours his liquid lay; While the blithe Spirit of the social plain Leads Health, and Love, and Gladness in his train. Crown'd with her pail, light rocking as she steps, Along the fresh moist grass, young Lucy trips. The rustic vest is from her ancle drawn, Yet catches many a dew-drop of the lawn. Warm on her downy cheek health's deepest glow, And in her eyes its lavish lustres flow; And in her voice its wildly-warbled song Floats, and returns the echoing glades among. Her nut-brown tresses wanton on the gale, Her breath perfumes afresh the blossom'd vale. Nine blooming maidens meet her in the grove, And ask and tell the tender tale of love; With their prone fork and mystic scroll they frame, Tracing on sand each heart-recorded name. O'er the bared shoulder hangs the idle rake, And busy Fancy paints the coming wake; But from the lip th' unfinish'd periods break, And joy's warm blushes deeper tinge the cheek; For, see th' expected youths, in manhood's pride, Stoutly are striding down the mountain's side; High o'er the rapid brook at once they bound, And gay good-morrows thro' the plain resound! And now is Labour busy in the dale; The cow stands duteous by the cleanly pail, Where the rich milk descends in eddying tides, Pure as the virgin hands thro' which it glides. The youths, with short'ning arm and bending head, Sweep their bright scythes along the shiver'd mead; Three blithsome maids the grassy treasure shake, Three draw, with gentle hand, the thrifty rake; And three, 'mid carol sweet and jocund tale, Scatter the breathing verdure to the gale. Where yonder cottages' ascending smoke, In spiral columns, wreaths the sun-gilt oak; The careful parents of the village dwell, And dress the savoury pottage in the cell; Their little rosy girls and boys prepare The steaming breakfast thro' the vale to bear. See, with pleased looks, gay Ceres' happy train Watch their young donors loaded on the plain, Inhale the grateful fumes that round them rise, Mark their slow, heedful step and earnest eyes, The chubby hands that grasp the circling rim, Where health's warm viand rises to the brim. Light on the violet bank recline the band, And take the present from the willing hand; With eager appetite, and poignant taste, Thank the kind bearers, and enjoy the feast. Yon tall white spire, that rises 'mid the trees, Courting, with golden vane, the passing breeze, A peal, far heard, sends merry down the dale, The notes of triumph tell a bridal tale. The hallow'd green sod the swift river laves, Dark alders trembling o'er the sunny waves; Its ripling breast receives each measured round, Mellowing the shrillness of the silver sound. Our youthful lovers hail th' harmonious noise, And Hope anticipates their bridal joys; Pours all her magic influence on the scene, Laughs in their eyes, and triumphs in their mien. Sportful their infant friends around them rove, And all is frolic, innocence, and love. May equal bliss the varying year adorn, And gild the labours of each future morn! Whether the wanton hours, that lead the spring, Catch silver rain-drops from her shining wing, Or zoneless Summer, flaunting o'er the meads, Empurpled bloom, and richest fragrance sheds; Or auburn Autumn, from her full lap, throws The mellow fruits upon the bending boughs; Or Winter, with his dark relentless train, Wind, snow, and sleet, shall desolate the plain; Howl o'er the hill, and as the river raves, In drear stagnation warp th' arrested waves. Yes, may the days of bloom and ripeness find Such joys rewarding each untainted mind; And, in the rage of the severer hours, May balmy Comfort, with assuasive powers, Present the stores by former toil amass'd, Pile the warm hearth, and dress the neat repast; Bid sport and song prepare the gladsome rite, Then smooth the pillow through the stormy night! Thus Health and Love the varying year shall crown, While Truth and Nature smile, tho' pale Refinement frown. INSCRIPTION For an Urn in a Gentleman's Garden, amid the Mountainous Parts of Scotland, where two Lovers had been killed by the fall of an impending Precipice. Blow, Winter-wind, these desert rocks around, No blight from thee my cypress garland fears! Away ye months, with light and roses crown'd! But, melting April, steep it in thy tears! Here the fond lover to his fair one told The tale of tenderness and gay delight, When, from its base, th' incumbent mountain roll'd, And Beauty, Youth, and Love, were whelm'd in night. Ah! gentle stranger, pensive o'er me bend, Who, in these deathful scenes, am doom'd to prove, A sad memorial of the timeless end, And living grave, of Beauty, Youth, and Love! LOVE ELEGIES AND EPISTLES. These little poems were written in the early youth of the author. They describe an attachment between a lady of birth, rank, beauty, and talents, the daughter of wealthy parents, and a gentleman, much her inferior in family and station, without fortune, and her equal only in intellect, merit, and affection. Nor is the situation entirely imaginary; the author was entrusted with the perusal of a prose correspondence between that unhappy pair, which bore the same sort of relation to the ensuing poems, as the real letters between Abelard and Eloisa bear to Pope's Love-Epistle, “Eloisa to Abelard.” EVANDER to EMILLIA. ELEGY. Dreary and dark, in autumn's wane, The mournful evening falls, And hollow winds and chilling rain Beat fast upon the walls. From the drench'd caves' incumbent tops, With wet and weltering sound, At intervals, the heavy drops Plash on the wat'ry ground. Time was, ah, well-remember'd time! When wintry blasts severe, More welcome than the vernal prime, Were music to my ear. When many an evening's stormy hour, Emillia, pass'd with thee, I thank'd the rain, and wind's loud roar, That banish'd all but me. Now my sick soul these wintry glooms Oppress with cruel sway, Since my life's light no more illume Dark eve, or sullen day. With folded arms, by waning fires, I hear the howling wind, And sigh that faithful fond desires Congenial winter find. Yes, long I sit by waning fires, And heavy eave-drops count; My heart no sprightlier sound requires, Or listless spirits want. For sprightly sounds discordant rise, Where cherish'd woes are dear, They but insult the lover's sighs, Insult his starting tear. Yet, yet my soul might better bear These absent weeks forlorn, Did not presaging clouds of fear Lour on thy wish'd return. Authority's yet dreaded power, Goaded by busy foes, May wait on that eventful hour, And bring a train of woes. Beneath this dread, by waning fires, I muse the night away; This dread, that 'gainst my peace conspires, Resist it as I may. O! let thy pen my throbbing heart With softest balm assuage, And better hopes, with love impart, To chase the sad presage! So shall I bless the minutes' course, How slow soe'er they move, Since bring they must the day, perforce, That gives me back my love. EVANDER to EMILLIA. EPISTLE. Can words, O loveliest of thy sex! express My soul's devotion in its wild excess? This hand, extended, might as soon contain The mighty waters of the boundless main. Tender and ardent is that heart of thine, But ah! not pierced,—not rapt,—not lost as mine! What man e'er shone on woman's dazzled gaze As thou on mine, bright sun-beam of my days! Tho' every youthful charm were round him placed, Narcissus boasted, or Adonis graced. Hope, Love, and Extacy's adorning sway, Inert and pale, upon my senses lay, Till, on their dull expanse, in floods of light, Stream'd those dear eyes—a day upon my night! Shed kindling graces o'er my altering frame, Till I nor look, nor seem, nor am the same. Thus all my thoughts, with secret force, persuade, Had ne'er on me these melting glances play'd; The honour'd object of thy tender cares, Whose now changed form a love-born magic wears, No more had lived, than life could be retain'd, When nor by air nor aliment sustain'd; A human shape indeed might breathe and move, Some dim resemblance of the man you loved; But, had his eyes been found indeed the same, Untouch'd by Passion's soul-enkindling flame? Source of that glow of intellect refined, That meets the efflux of thy fervent mind! The same his lip, without its conscious smiles, Gay progeny of hope, and tender wiles? Thro' life's dull path plodding their destined way, In the trite business of the vapid day, Would equal grace his listless limbs have crown'd, As when o'er the unburden'd earth they bound, Seek, with elastic speed, her gladdening sight, Who speaks in music, and who moves in light? Ah no! such cold privation had assign'd His form unlovely, as opake his mind. In the dun slip, a garden falsely call'd, Narrow and long, with dusty brick enwall'd. Behind the crowded streets, whose mansions high Breathe the thick smoke, that shrowds the summer sky, If there a hapless rose-tree meets the view, How faint its odour, and how dim its hue! A dusky red each rivell'd orbit wears, And tinged with livid yellowness appears. Borne where th' exhaling scents perfume the dawn, From glowing border, or from verdant lawn, Where soft showers fall, and tepid breezes blow, And setting suns in golden radiance flow, What living bloom the swelling globes array! What rich luxuriance loads the bending spray! Its poignant sweets the stealing gales disclose, And Flora boasts the splendour of her rose. So boasts Emillia of the form and face Love, and her charms, endow'd with all their grace, That lost to them, no eye had e'er allured A canker'd rose, by sunless walls immured. Light of my life, with all thy cloudless rays, Shine ever thus, and gild my future days; Still shed those vital beams, whose blest controul My frame illumined, and inspired my soul! ELEGY. EMILLIA EMBROIDERING—AND JEALOUS. My partial friends, ye praise the mimic flowers, Which from my hand, in gay creation, rise; But, ah! this little talent's flatter'd powers No pleasing gleam of self-applause supplies. Vainly ye descant on the golden light, Vainly the soft and blended shades ye praise; Observe my florets swell upon the sight, And curve, and float from their entwining sprays. Fatal to me has proved this native sense Of grace and beauty, that their brilliant glow Taught my obedient needle to dispense, And lead their wavy lines in easy flow. But for that treacherous sense, with calm survey, These eyes Evander's charming form had met, Then had my peaceful night, my jocund day, Escaped delusive joy, and long regret; This sad distrust, these cruel pangs unfelt, That shroud the vernal mornings as they shine, Now that Evander's eyes no longer melt In tender passion, as they gaze on mine; Now, that he wastes in idle cares the days, Who once long ages deem'd each absent hour; Now, that a rival nymph so often strays, With air embarrass'd, round Evander's bower. (j.) EPISTLE. EVANDER TO EMILLIA. [O! why this ceaseless, cruel, strange distrust] O! why this ceaseless, cruel, strange distrust, To thy own charms, and my vow'd faith unjust? Ingrate!—with what impatience did I dart On these expected scriptures of thy heart! Yet while my lips their seal unbroken press'd, A latent dread rose sickening in my breast; Since, ah! too oft, of late, the sullen eye, The air repulsive, the upbraiding sigh, Repress'd—no not repress'd my fond desires, But fed their rising flame with gloomy fires. And now, as if 'twere not enough of pain, That long, long tracts of hill, and dale, and plain, Rise separating, and force our hearts to prove The sick dejection of divided love; Doubts that from shadowy causes wildly flow, Change sick dejection to corrosive woe. Conscious of all its torture on my soul, Thou pourest honey in the venom'd bowl Of causeless jealousy, of needless strife, Dark suicides on all the joys of life! But long it is since sweetness unallay'd Was to my thirsty, glowing lip convey'd In that diurnal draught, thy hands consign To him, whose heart, irrevocably thine, Resents, and dreads, sighs, shudders, and deplores, To death desires thee, and to guilt adores. Away, ye murmurs!—do not dazzling charms, Each grace that gay, triumphant beauty arms, Wit, genius, affluence, and pride, unite To quench my daring hopes in endless night; Bid her avoid his sight, and scorn his truth, Whose lot obscure o'er-shades her radiant youth; And who her peace too generously prefers To join his yet improsp'rous fate with hers, Till Time and Industry disperse the gloom, In which relentless Fortune shrouds his home? But O! she would forsake her summer-bower, Tho' fierce winds howl, and clouds tempestuous lour, Commit to all their rage her tender form, And share with him the pelting of the storm! Then with whate'er injustice she upbraid, Whate'er my shock'd, recoiling sense invade Indifference, perfidy, or latent art, Charged thus remorseless on my faithful heart, That fears to lead her where the tempest blows, And glooms impend of deep-involving woes, Yet, O my soul! the dread arraignment bear, Nor cherish anger, nor admit despair; Since, if she ceased to love, her rage would cease, The heart emancipated sinks to peace, Calls calm disdain and silence to its aid, And, once renouncing, will no more upbraid! Come then, ye sweet and bitter pages, come, Traced by the hand that must award my doom; By thine, Emillia, despot of my soul, My life's adorner, and my fate's controul. Then, tho' deplore I must these doubts insane, Their dire reproaches, their presages vain, Still every wild, injurious thought of thine, While thy dear heart-strings round my image twine, I will endure;—and deprecate the scorn, Of jealous love, not cold indifference, born; Appease this seeming—O! but seeming hate, Know I am loved, and compromise with Fate. ELEGY. EMILLIA TO EVANDET—IN RENAWED JEALOUSY. The wailful accents of an heart in pain, The sigh prophetic, the upbraiding tear— Can their obtrusive sorrows hope to gain My wandering lover's cold, reluctant ear? My lover!—I renounce th' expression vain;— How vain, ingrate! thy alienated eyes To Lydia's flatter'd pride too well explain, Thy soft attentions, thy desiring sighs. Once they were mine;—but they are mine no more! Yet how I prized them all too well thou know'st; Well as I know complaint will ne'er restore My powerless eyes the empire they have lost. This younger, gayer rival, who obtains The vows, long-pledged to me—will her light heart Thrill with the pleasures, tremble with the pains Thy griefs inflict, or that thy joys impart? Tho' Time has still, in all their power to please, Left the unfaded graces of thy form, Yet oh! his iron hand must shortly seize That air, that look, with love and transport warm. Seize them with blighting force, ere Lydia's youth, And scanty stock of beauty, scanty sure! Shall pass away;—then can'st thou trust her truth? Hope for attachment permanent and pure? Hope it from such an heart, from such a mind, When thy yet lovely form dim age assails, And, from their now meridian course declined, Shrouds all thy graces in his icy veils? Ah, no!—disparity, the scorner's jest, Shall gloom with sad distrust each passing day, And to the pillow of thy midnight rest The wounding thorns of jealousy convey. Thy grieved remonstrance then will Lydia hear? Vouchsafe to sooth thee e'en with faithless vows? Check, for Evander's peace, her gay career, And shun the pleasures honour disallows? O! when th' uplifted eye-brow's steady scorn Shall rack thy fondness, and confirm thy fears, Each hope of thine to soften, or to warn, Vain as my sighs, and wasted as my tears, Then of the throes, that now my bosom swell, Perfidious! shalt thou feel how sharp the pain, And my proud rival shall avenge me well On all thy broken vows and cold disdain! EPISTLE. EVANDER TO EMILLIA. [Ah! can'st thou say contemptuously I smiled] Ah! can'st thou say contemptuously I smiled When thou, with flashing eye and vehemence wild, Solemn did'st urge that I would bend no more My steps to Lydia's interdicted door?— Smile!—yes, I might, but no contemptuous air Breath'd hated insult on my angry fair; Well might I smile, that dread of Lydia's charms Thy dear, tumultuous, jealous heart alarms! Lydia thy rival!—O resistless power Of that momentous, consecrated hour, When in thy soften'd eye's seducing gaze I read the transports of my future days, Can its remembrance, all my soul that fires, E'en in thy absence kindling fierce desires, Permit a momentary wish to prove The base apostacy of grov'ling love? As soon my wandering steps should desperate roam Far from these blooming shades, my youth's loved home, Where winding vallies wave in golden pride, Thro' tufted banks, where glassy rivers glide; Where fleecy flocks the green hill's side adorn, Gay linnets warbling from the blossom'd thorn, And each wide mead, and little sloping field To numerous herds the silver'd herbage yield; These would I leave, as soon, for some rude shore, Vex'd by the stormy sea's incessant roar; Or seek the clime, whose frowning aspect shocks, Where arid heaths stretch lonely o'er the rocks, And but one narrow stream's chill waters pour, In straight blue line, along the russet moor, Or, at the foot of mountains, bare and pale, Obliquely huddles down the stony vale; While all the phantoms, which the desert haunt, Danger, and Dread, and Misery, and Want, In blank sterility's abhorr'd domain, With houseless solitude and silence reign. Yet be my home such scene of dire alarms, If e'er I seek thy rival's meaner charms; Nor must thou dream that aught of insult dwelt In that spontaneous smile's imputed guilt. Contempt of thee!—O! never could it rise, E'en in contending Beauty's jealous eyes! Thy sex's envy may produce their hate Of those eclipsing charms that round thee wait; Man's selfish pride, for daring to reprove, With undissembled scorn, presumptuous love; But none were ever, for an instant, free From insuppressive reverence of thee; And could thy dear Evander's lip reveal What yet nor slighted love nor envy feel?— The luckless smile, that did thy rage inspire, Was anger, melting in enamour'd fire, Beneath that childish frown upon thy brow, And eager claim of a superfluous vow. It was those ever-varying traits, combined, Of face, of form, of temper, and of mind; Those infant graces, with the ripen'd charms, That full-blown youth in gay resplendence warms; Yes, 'twas their fascinating union fired My daring passion, which so high aspired; Else had this heart, by calmer wishes sway'd, To thy bright self a safer homage pay'd; Awed by thy wit, thy birth, thy beauty's rays, Had view'd thy form with less tumultuous gaze. But thou, infatuating foe of peace! Thou dear, child-woman! by thy strange caprice, Join'd to thy charms, thy talents proud controul, And softness, stealing o'er my captive soul, Hast left me no alternative to prove, But death, or madness, if I lose thy love. ELEGY. EVANDER TO EMILLIA. [Thou say'st my love is reasonless, to spare] Thou say'st my love is reasonless, to spare No glance, no smile, that ceremonies crave, To Being masculine, ere yet he bear, White on his brow, the blossoms of the grave. I own the charge;—for ah! do I not know The power of each bright glance, each lovely smile? That dangerous transport, or that cureless woe, Seizes the heart, their melting sweets beguile? Thy early looks, thy early smiles on me Shone unimpassion'd; no enamour'd ray Shot thro' my fever'd senses, to decree Death, or possession, to the future day. Yet so essential to my peace they grew, All was delightless where they failed to flow, Tho' too serenely shining on my view To bid one thought with rising passion glow. Not then arisen the dazzling, magic light, Which now for me the Summer's sun adorns With lustre, ah! so exquisitely bright, That all the rays, gilding his splendid morns, Robb'd of its effluence, seem to my sick soul, Dim as the April dawn, with clouds begirt, Clouds, that but catch, as thro' the skies they roll, One wat'ry gleam, to edge their dusky skirt. “Unreasonable!”—alas! thou know'st not how, How much unreasonable!—for O! 'tis more Than yet rapacious passion durst avow, Than love delirious ever knew before!— Then, if thou would'st the balm of life should steal Soft o'er my lids, when night's dun sceptre sways; That health's warm beams disease's mists repel Through my or few, or many coming days, Guard, towards all others, guard thy lips, thine eyes, Cold be to them the hopes thy graces bring! Thy glance,—the sun in winter's icy skies, Thy smile,—the first pale ray of tardy Spring! (j.) EPISTLE. EVANDER TO EMILLIA. [Yes, my Emillia, I can say with truth] Yes, my Emillia, I can say with truth, Had Emma's Henry really stain'd his youth With those dark crimes his jealousy assumed, By murder branded, and to exile doom'd, Passion sincere had forced him to dissuade From sharing fate so dire, the noble maid; Prompted each plea he urges to remove The dread resolve of such disastrous love, Short of the base reproach, the Cynic sneer, And boasted fondness for a lovelier fair, Closing the trial, needless and severe. Too well I know thy heart, which fate inspires With Emma's softness, Eloisa's fires, Has deem'd my rack'd affection's guardian fear To snatch thee, from thy calm, and sunny sphere, Down to the clime, where clouds and whirlwinds spread, A faithless scruple, and a coward dread; That thou for me would'st every ill endure, When, drear as Winter, as its tempests sure, Reproach and penury, around us flow, And quench our marriage torch in floods of woe. Thou dar'st remind me, in a covert threat, Of the proud scorn devoted Hammond met, Who, when he own'd his terrors to involve Her he adored in selfish love's resolve, Till the depriving frowns of Fate should cease, And his walls glow with competence and peace, Heard her impute to dull indifference' power The generous scruple of that ill-starr'd hour; Saw her their long-twined bands of fondness tear, Rush to another's arms, and leave him to despair. Me thou remindest of that cruel scorn, Of female pride, and causeless vengeance born. I feel the latent meaning most unkind, And thee, injurious maid, in turn, remind, That poor, forsaken, ruin'd Hammond died The victim of his Delia's faithless pride. And let thy rage, with fancied wrongs insane, Steel every thought with Delia's proud disdain, The instant thou shalt feel thy heart can bear The doom congenial of my last despair; Feel that remorse no pang'd regret shall raise, To blast the quiet of thy future days.

What is my crime, unjust Emillia, say?— Yes, I am guilty!—but no guilt towards thee My conscious sighs, my starting tears betray. This heart its thankless coldness should deplore, Too beauteous despot, at an higher shrine, Lost, as I seem, in life's meridian hour, To all created excellence but thine. Yon gorgeous sun, no more my light by day, For me the moon's soft, shadowy shining vain; Me, nor the rose delights, in bright array, Me, nor the silver lily of the plain. Before thy charms the blooming season fades, A love delirious, with tyrannic sway, Absorbs my every thought, my soul pervades, Thy frown my darkness, and thy smile my day! Then may injurious jealousy be driven Far from thy heart, and all its peace return! Instruct me to reform my crime to Heaven, But love me dearer for the guilt I mourn! (j.) EPISTLE.

[O! thou art absent, and resentment's power] O! thou art absent, and resentment's power Forsakes Evander in this lonely hour; His weak resolves dispersed, he sees not now The angry knitting of thy scornful brow; Forgets that its dear curves, by Nature made Those beamy eyes to soften and to shade, And graceful, in that kind assignment, look As alders bending o'er the glassy brook, To his afflicted sight so lately rose Deform'd by fancied wrongs, and causeless woes. Now present only to his mental sight Those orbs, that roll in floods of dewy light, Tempering beneath his gaze their dazzling ray, Like bright stars waning at the dawn of day; To his internal ear, from that sweet tongue, No sounds less melting than the syren's song, Such, as in days long fled, resistless stole Through every thrill'd perception of his soul; Yes, only such, thy boundless power to prove, Brings the recording spirit of his love.

[I wish in vain!—too distant thou] I wish in vain!—too distant thou To hear thy lover's plaintive voice; Enchantress, wert thou present now, To urge his oft repeated vow, Would'st thou his drooping soul rejoice? Would'st thou extend thy snowy arms, And clasp him to thy fragrant breast? Sooth every dread that yet alarms From cruel Fate's impending harms, And lull corroding cares to rest? Blest recompense for years of pain!— Come, Angel, come, with look benign, Come to the heart, whose warm disdain Would spurn a crown and regal train, Opposed to one soft glance of thine! But O! too oft Reflection arms Against my peace, and sullen dwells On my scant dole of all the charms, Whose power eye-govern'd woman warms, And her enamour'd wish impells. I grudge thee then that auburn hair, Which thy transparent brow adorns, Thy thrilling smile, thy graceful air, A voice, to soften stern despair, A cheek, that shames the summer morns. But O! much more than all, my heart Breathes o'er those orbs its jealous sighs; Those orbs, that rays of genius dart, That love's resistless powers impart, Those smiling, chiding, fatal eyes.

The precious tenderness these lines impart, Falls on my sick, alarmed, and longing heart, Like dews on flowers by sultry noon-beams dry, Like balmy sleep on Labour's closing eye. But this long absence!—Countless are its pains, Sprung from the thought, how fast our being wanes, How scant its span!—that weeks and months must roll Towards love, and life's dark and avoidless goal, Ere Time the ravish'd happiness restores To pass together some of those few hours, Forming the short, irrevocable day, Which stays for none, and fleets so swift away. ELEGY. EVANDET TO EMILLIA. [Emillia, thou art far away] Emillia, thou art far away, And languid creep the vacant hours; Yet, when the last mild evening chased, With yellow light, the recent showers, Their wonted path my slow steps found, The green and shady lanes among, That wind around the sylvan cot, The cot with ivy curtains hung. Soft setting sun-beams gently glanced O'er the young leaves a sweet farewell; But ah! to these delightless eyes How vacant seem'd the bloomy cell! Tho' gilded by that vernal light, Tho' linnets warbled in the gale, A lone and wintry look it wore, And silence seem'd to shroud the vale. Thy little faithful dog I met, Saw him the circling lanes explore, Rush down the glades, then up the steps Spring to thy closed and silent door; With eager eye and plaintive whine, Snuff thro' each chink the passing air; Ah! little wretch, I mournful cried, Thy lovely mistress is not there! Slowly he walk'd away, and hung His sullen head,—and nothing cared How oft I call'd to tempt his stay, And sooth the peevish grief I shared. He left me near the silent door, No more half-open'd to thy friend When dull the clouds of Evening lour, And fast her heavy dews descend; Or drizzling rains, that often weep, When winds no longer bend the spray, The moist and early vanish'd sun, That shrinks from April's wayward day. Now, in that little hall's dear grate, No social embers glow the while, To us so kindly to disclose The mutual glance, the tender smile. Protecting walls!—asylum blest, From every influence unkind! The rigour of inclement skies, The rigour of th' unfeeling mind; From Pride and Avarice' taunting sneer, Authority's yet dreaded frown, Whose chidings loud the gentle voice Of Love's persuasive pleadings drown. That sylvan cottage is thine own, A tender mother's kind bequest; Far from thy haughty father's power, 'Twill give us shelter, food, and rest. Till that was thine, thou know'st full well I pleaded 'gainst my self to thee, Opposing thy too generous love, Which dared the last distress for me. But now, that shelter, food, and rest, May meet us in this ivy bower, Come to these faithful longing arms, And scorn the curbs of Pride and Power! The busy bustling haunts of men, Thy lover shall for thee resign; For us the Winter's hearth shall glow, For us the Summer sun will shine. The great ones court thee for their bride; With thee, in ceremonial glare, They would the pomps of life divide, For that the world proclaims thee fair. Ah! it is vanity, not love, That bids them prize thy matchless charms; But love alone, and love like mine, Deserves the heaven of those soft arms. But can that tender yielding soul Its generous warfare long maintain, Defy constraint, and haste to seek The shelter of these arms again? O yes! while Memory's power remains, Her glowing images shall prove, In thy dear breast, the constant guards, When Force would disunite our love. ELEGY. EVANDET TO EMILLIA.

For now my love-devoted soul at rest, Hails all the lonely graces of the scene; Hails them in soft, confiding fondness blest, And leaves Ambition to her anxious spleen. Her pomps, her triumphs, disregarded shine, While fair Emillia's melting heart is mine. Would I this lock of my Emillia's hair, Floating in golden threads upon the breeze, Resign for all Ambition's votaries wear, For all they pine to see a rival seize? Ah, no! dear pledge of Love and Hope, that pour Their precious essence on this rosy hour! Fate will restore thee, angel, kind and bright As Spring's gay morning on the troubled sea, That heaved and surged thro' the long, stormy night, Like my tumultuous soul when far from thee, By thy vain doubts disturb'd and jealous throes, Darkening our perils by superfluous woes. The clouds disperse! our long-disastrous love, Trembling beneath pale Ruin's hovering wings, Emerges from their shade!—O! may it prove No meteor-fire, that now before us springs, But a mild pole-star to the dear retreat, Where Peaoe and Competence our steps shall greet. O! to gaze on thee all the summer's day, Hear thy sweet accents charm the winter eve, And through the hours of slumber's stealing sway Thy balmy breathings on my cheek perceive! What full reward for every woe, that shed Gloom on th' impassion'd years, irrevocably fled! (j.) EVANDER to EMILLIA.

O! pitiless of spirit!—but away, Ye weak complaints, ye unavailing groans! Now, stung by Disappointment's madd'ning sway, Scruples, and fears, my desperate love disowns. Oft did they wound thee;—I abjure their crimes! Extinct all hope of more propitious times, Long years of wasted youth elapsed I see, And former terrors curse—e'en tho' they throbb'd for thee. Her hovering ghost, whose violated boon Sought from the scourge of power our loves to save, Shall see us meet,—now,—in this night's pale noon, And lock our hands across her sacred grave. There thy decisive vows my soul shall claim; By the last silence of her mouldering frame, By Death's dark shrines and unresisted power, That only his dread stroke shall e'er divide us more. Still can Emillia's heart, like mine, desire? Then Fate in vain may spread her direst loom; Nor yet, if Persecution light her pyre, Shall its fierce flames our destin'd joys consume. A robe of pure asbestos we can wear, And while the raging fires around us glare, With arms entwined our solemn steps shall move, Safe in the shielding garb, supplied by faithful love. All that affrights the prosperous and the vain, Reproach, with taunting lip, and scornful brow, And shuddering penury, and fever'd pain, To blast the powers of life, the spirit bow; The bed of death, the dim funereal gloom, A timeless pall, an unlamented doom, Clasp'd in each other's arms, be firmly scorn'd, Nor ought of wealth and pride, for love renounced, be mourn'd! Then shall I gaze on my Emillia's form Through the long summer's day and winter's night; Her smile my sun, her frown my only storm, Her health and love, my sources of delight; Her grave, my quiet bed of lasting rest, Where power, and hate, no longer shall molest, Reproach and penury no more dismay, While undivided sleeps our earthly-hapless clay. HONORA, AN ELEGY. Written on the terrace walk in the palace garden, Lichfield, the day on which Miss Honora Sneyd left that place for a month's residence in Shropshire, May 1769. Honora fled, I seek her favourite scene With hasty step, as I should meet her there; The hasty step and the disorder'd mien Fond expectation's anxious semblance wear. This bowery terrace, where she frequent stray'd, And frequent cull'd for me the floral wreath, That tower, that lake,—yon willow's ample shade, This celebrated willow of Stowe Valley, from its very uncommon magnitude, excites the attention of naturalists. It is of recorded dearness to Dr Johnson, whence a mistaken idea arose that he had planted it. All, all the vale her spirit seems to breathe. I seize the loved resemblance it displays, With mixture strange of anguish and delight; I bend on vacancy an earnest gaze, Where strong illusion cheats my straining sight. But ah, it fades!—and no relief I find, Save that which silence, memory, hope confer; Too soon the local semblance leaves my mind, E'en where each object seem'd so full of her. And Memory, only Memory, can impart The dear enduring image to my view; Has she not drawn thee, loveliest, on my heart In faithful tints, and permanent as true? Transcending all associate forms disclose Of evanescent likeness; or each grace The breathing pencil's happiest effort throws O'er the bright lines that imitate thy face. As much too fix'd as theirs too fleeting found, The pencil but one look, one gesture brings; But varying charms, each accent's thrilling sound From Recollection's juster portrait springs. Be then th' embosom'd image only sought, Since perfect only can its magic prove! O! rise with all Honora's sweetness fraught, Vivid, and perfect, as her Anna's love. Shew me how fair she seems, when on the gale Her waving locks, in soft luxuriance, play; As lightly bounding down the dewy vale, She pours her rival beauties on the day! How fair, e'en when displeasure's darkening frown, And scorn itself are lovely on her brow; Like summer shades, that sweep the vale adown, Pass o'er the flowers, and heighten all their glow; Yet fairer, when her brightening spirit spreads, In blest vicissitude, the cheering ray, As Sensibility, quick veering, sheds Its clouds and sun-shine o'er her April-day. But fairest when her vermeil lips disclose, In many a magic smile and melting tone, The varied accent through the pearly rows, That proves the mental graces all her own. THE ANNIVERSARY. WRITTEN JUNE 1769. Ah, lovely Lichfield! that so long hast shone In blended charms, peculiarly thine own; Stately, yet rural; through thy choral day, Though shady, cheerful, and though quiet, gay; How interesting, how loved, from year to year, How more than beauteous did thy scenes appear! Still, as the mild Spring chased the wintry gloom, Devolved her leaves, and waked her rich perfume, Thou, with thy fields and groves around thee spread, Lift'st, in unlessen'd grace, thy spiry head; But many a loved inhabitant of thine Sleeps where no vernal sun will ever shine. Why fled ye all so fast, ye happy hours, That saw Honora's eyes adorn these bowers? These darling bowers, that much she loved to hail, The spires, she call'd “the Ladies of the Vale!” Fairest, and best!—Oh! can I e'er forget To thy dear kindness my eternal debt? Life's opening paths how tenderly it smooth'd, The joys it heighten'd, and the pains it sooth'd? No, no! my heart its sacred memory bears, Bright 'mid the shadows of o'erwhelming years; When mists of deprivation round me roll, 'Tis the soft sun-beam of my clouded soul. Ah, dear Honora! that remember'd day, First on these eyes when shone thy early ray! Scarce o'er my head twice seven gay springs had gone, Scarce five o'er thy unconscious childhood flown, When, fair as their young flowers, thy infant frame To our glad walls an happy inmate came. O! summer morning, of unrivall'd light, Fate wrapt thy rising in prophetic white! June, the bright month, when Nature joys to wear The livery of the gay, consummate year, Gave that envermeil'd day-spring all her powers, Gemm'd the light leaves, and glow'd upon the flowers; Bade her plumed nations hail the rosy ray With warbled orisons from every spray. Purpureal Tempe, not to thee belong More poignant fragrance, or more jocund song. Thrice happy day! thy clear auspicious light Gave “future years a tincture of thy white;” Well may her strains thy votive hymn decree, Whose sweetest pleasures found their source in thee; The purest, best that memory explores, Safe in the past's inviolable stores.— The ardent progress of thy shining hours Beheld me rove through Lichfield's verdant bowers, Thoughtless and gay, and volatile and vain, Circled by nymphs, and youths, a frolic train; Though conscious that a little orphan child Had to my parents' guidance, kind and mild, Recent been summon'd, when disease and death Shed dark stagnation o'er her mother's breath. While eight sweet infants' wailful cries deplore What not the tears of innocence restore; And while the husband mourn'd his widow'd doom, And hung despondent o'er the closing tomb, To us this loveliest scion he consign'd, Its beauty blossoming, its opening mind. His heart-felt loss had drawn my April tears, But childish, womanish, ambiguous years Find all their griefs as vanishing as keen, Youth's rising sun soon gilds the showery scene. On the expected trust no thought I bent, Unknown the day, unheeded the event. One sister dear, from spleen, from falsehood free, Rose to the verge of womanhood with me: Gloom'd by no envy, by no discord jarr'd, Our pleasures blended, and our studies shared; And when with day and waking thoughts they closed, On the same couch our agile limbs reposed. Amply in friendship by her virtues blest, I gave to youthful gaiety the rest; Considering not how near the period drew When that transplanted branch should meet our view, Whose intellectual fruits were doom'd to rise, Food of the future's heart-expanding joys; Born to console me when, by Fate severe, The Much Beloved Miss Sarah Seward, who died in her 19th year, and on the verge of her purposed nuptials. should press a timeless bier, My friend, my sister, from my arms be torn, Sickning and sinking on her bridal morn; While Hymen, speeding from this mournful dome, Should drop his darken'd torch upon her tomb. 'Twas eve;—the sun, in setting glory dress'd, Spread his gold skirts along the crimson west; A Sunday's eve!—Honora, bringing thee, Friendship's soft Sabbath long it rose to me, When on the wing of circling seasons borne, Annual I hail'd its consecrated morn. In the kind interchange of mutual thought, Our home myself and gentle sister sought; Our pleasant home, The Bishop's Palace at Lichfield. round which th' ascending gale Breathes all the freshness of the sloping vale; On her green verge the spacious walls arise, View her fair fields, and catch her balmy sighs; See her near hills the bounded prospect close, And her blue lake in glassy breadth repose. With arms entwined, and smiling as we talk'd, To the maternal room we careless walk'd, Where sat its honour'd mistress, and with smile Of love indulgent, from a floral pile The gayest glory of the summer bower Cull'd for the new-arrived,—the human flower, A lovely infant-girl, who pensive stood Close to her knees, and charm'd us as we view'd. O! hast thou mark'd the Summer's budded rose, When 'mid the veiling moss its crimson glows? So bloom'd the beauty of that fairy-form, So her dark locks, with golden tinges warm, Play'd round the timid curve of that white neck, And sweetly shaded half her blushing cheek. O! hast thou seen the star of eve on high, Through the soft dusk of Summer's balmy sky, Shed its green light, and in the glassy stream Eye the mild reflex of its trembling beam? So look'd on us, with tender, bashful gaze, The destined charmer of our youthful days; Whose soul its native elevation join'd To the gay wildness of the infant mind, Esteem and sacred confidence impress'd While our fond arms the beauteous child caress'd. Dear Sensibility! how soon thy glow Dyed that fair cheek, and gleam'd from that young brow! How early, Gen erosity, you taught The warm disdain of every grov'ling thought, Round sweet Honora, e'en in infant youth, Shed the majestic light of spotless truth; Bid her for others' sorrow pour the tear, For others' safety feel th' instinctive fear; But for herself, scorning the impulse weak, Meet every danger with unaltering cheek; And through the generally unmeaning years Of heedless childhood, to thy guardian cares, Angelic Friendship, her young moments give, And heedless of herself for others live. ODE TO CONTENT. Mild as the star-beam on the silent wave, Soft as the tints of yon etherial bow, That bends its bright arch o'er the dark concave, And bids the storm its destined limit know, Do thou, Content, with equal step sedate, Rise o'er the mind's dim clouds, and break the storms of Fate! O! welcome as the spirit of the morn, Whose diamond eyes prelude a golden day, Choir'd by the linnets from the blossom'd thorn, The green hill yellowing in her dewy ray, As o'er its timid bosom soft she glides, Silvering the winding rill, that warbles down its sides! While, with a loosen'd zone, gay Pleasure strays, Crowning with rosy wreaths the frolic hours, While busy Fame collects immortal bays, And Hope reclines in amaranthine bowers, Round thee, Content, health-breathing sweets exhale, As crops thy gentle hand yon lilies of the vale. On fair Honora may thy influence shine For her thy cheek with purest blushes glow! More does she prize one halcyon plume of thine Than all that decks Ambition's jewel'd brow. Near her may thy light steps perpetual rove With the associate forms of Fancy, Truth, and Love! EPISTLE TO MISS HONORA SNEYD. —Written, Sept. 1770. Miss H. Sneyd was then at Bristol, on account of a consumptive complaint. Alone, beneath these bowers, last night I stray'd, The spires high peering o'er their green arcade; There see thy friend delusion's power employ To bid one faithless moment gleam with joy; For this thy name pervades the twilight gloom, Borne by soft echoes round the sacred dome. I call'd Honora in that cheerful tone, Which oft pursued, when for an instant flown, And always brought thee back, with lively air, The rising thought, or sprightly song to share. Ah! dearest, mark thou, with a pitying smile, The flattering, soothing, self-deceiving guile! Back on the half-closed door I turn'd mine eye, And taught my heart to fancy thou wert nigh; That, as thou'rt wont, at Love's alarm'd request, Thou hadst return'd to seek a warmer vest, To shield thee from the dangers evening brings, Chill gales, and night-dews on her humid wings; That I should see thee glide the steps adown Fleet in the haste, with which thou still wert prone Again to seek the friend, who never yet Thy wish'd return with heart ungladden'd met. Yet, why, thou urgest, by deception gain A mimic joy, that must increase the pain When Disappointment brings her sick chagrin To lone Privation's melancholy scene? But O! each varied species Sorrow knows Endured for thee, Honora, welcome grows More than or festal wit, or syren air, Which thou, my life's adorner, dost not share. Calm were the gales, the Moon, serenely bright, Shed her white efflux thro' the noon of night, And the long shadows of the spires were drawn Distinct, with all their turrets, on the lawn. Raised to their summit, my enthusiast eyes Hail'd those loved witnesses of all my joys; Of each expanding charm that crown'd thy youth, Beauty and wit, and elegance and truth; Warm hopes and smiles gilding the happy years, Dimm'd but by transient Sorrow's April-tears. O! how those pleasures deck'd the rising days, Winter's pale dawn, and Summer's kindling rays! Shall e'er again, I cried, in thrilling strains, Such orient mornings tinge yon golden vanes? Fatigued, at length, on those proud heights to dwell, On the moist, silver'd ground my glances fell; But still each thought with fair Honora staid, Who late, enervate, from her Lichfield stray'd; Seeking, where Bristol's tepid fountains rise, The health that fled beneath our colder skies. Then thus again, in half-formed accents, stole Th' impassion'd dictates of her Anna's soul. Ah! sure she must, at those soft springs, regain The strength that wasted on her favourite plain! Their lenient power the fever's course shall break, That dyed with hectic flash her lovely cheek; Parch'd that moist lip, and from its vermeil hue Exhaled energic Health's ambrosial dew; And, banishing the Wood-Nymph's airy grace, Sunk the light step in Languor's stealing pace; Bade the warm sense of Pleasure fade and cloy, And veil'd the facile smile of Youth and Joy. Yet that she will return, my soul divines, Bright o'er its fears that dear dependence shines; Return, with frame unclouded by disease, With sense of pleasure, and the wish to please. Thus, to the downcast eye of musing thought, Fondness and Hope their glowing visions brought; Charm'd to anticipate, with cheering powers, The sweet revival of those happy hours, When, brief or long, the ever-gladden'd day Left on our pillows, as it stole away, Not one regret, save for its rapid flight, And not a fear, but lest some cruel blight, From injured health, or accidental harm, Deny the successor its power to charm, And shroud that ardent Spirit which explores Science' bright fanes, and Fancy's fairy bowers. So, while the past and future were combined In the light chains, by Hope and Memory twined, Up to those conscious spires I look'd once more, Whispering my heart that Heaven would soon restore Honora to her loved domestic scene, With health's clear spirit glowing thro' her mien. Surprised, I saw their spiral summits hazed, Dim, and more dim, receding as I gazed; And scarce a minute passed, ere in a cloud The mist convolving, form'd a total shroud. Damp on my heart the dark'ning omen fell, And rising tears within my eye-lids swell. So late this moon-deck'd night, high o'er the fanes, When not a breeze crept on the neighbouring plains, Sat tracing their fair forms in state serene, With shadowy pencil, on the silver'd green. And now,—but let me not my peace resign, Grim Superstition, at thy sable shrine! Demon of Night, and baseless terror fly, Nor charge with omens the capricious sky! Vows not Honora that the vital flame Relumes its course thro' her late languid frame? Yes,—the light form, the fair expressive face, Assume their pristine bloom, their nameless grace. Soon shall my soul that fervid spirit find Darting each varied effluence of mind; And since in those dear veins the purple tide Begins once more in even streams to glide, My gladden'd eye, in Hope's perspective cast, Sees future days enchanting as the past; As blest a consciousness the sun illume, And gild the dimness of the wintry gloom; Shed wonted lustre o'er the Spring's soft hours, And deck in brighter glow her rising flowers; While sweeter still the woodland pours its strains, And morns as roseate tinge yon golden vanes. ELEGY WRITTEN AT THE SEA-SIDE. AND ADDRESSED TO MISS HONORA SNEYD. I write, Honora, on the sparkling sand!— The envious waves forbid the trace to stay: Honora's name again adorns the strand! Again the waters bear their prize away! So Nature wrote her charms upon thy face, The cheek's light bloom, the lip's envermeil'd dye, And every gay, and every witching grace, That Youth's warm hours, and Beauty's stores supply. But Time's stern tide, with cold Oblivion's wave, Shall soon dissolve each fair, each fading charm; E'en Nature's self, so powerful, cannot save Her own rich gifts from this o'erwhelming harm. Love and the Muse can boast superior power, Indelible the letters they shall frame; They yield to no inevitable hour, But will on lasting tablets write thy name. EPISTLE TO MISS HONORA SNEYD, MAY 1772. WRITTEN IN A SUMMER EVENING, FROM THE GRAVE OF A SUICIDE. This spot is known to the inhabitants of Lichfield by the name of Bessy Banks' Grave. When the author walked thither, in the year 1791, she found the two trees, which stood on each side the tumulus, had been recently cut down, and deplored a devastation which she almost fancied sacrilegious. It suits the temper of my soul to pour Fond, fruitless plaints beneath the lonely bower, Here, in this silent glade, that childhood fears, Where the love-desperate maid, of vanish'd years, Slung her dire cord between the sister trees, That slowly bend their branches to the breeze, And shade the bank that screens her mouldering form, From the swart Dog-Star, and the wintry storm. Ah! dear Honora, summer sheds again Music, and fragrance, light, and bloom, in vain, While my sick heart thy smiles no longer cheer, Nor melt thine accents on my listening ear. An hour has finish'd its appointed date, Since on this lone recorded turf I sate.— How quiet is the green seclusion found! How deep the solitude that broods around! No labouring hinds on yonder meads appear, No human voice, no distant step, I hear; Yet the sweet linnets warble on the bough, And tender ringdoves languishingly coo; The nearly-meeting trees, with plenteous spray, Arch o'er the darkling lane that winds away Far to the right.—In front, the silent fields Now shadows sweep, now evening radiance gilds; While, to the left, soft sun-beams, as they wane, Yellow the green paths of the lonely lane; Where lavish hedgerows boast the wilding's bloom, Where briar-roses shed their rich perfume; And gadding woodbines, as their branches wave, Waft all their fragrance to the hapless grave. Ah! much I grieve that summer hours consume, Unshared by thee, the rival of their bloom; Hours that soft joys should thro' the heart infuse, And steep the eye-lids in their balmy dews. To thee, Honora, sister of my soul, To thee be all their blessings as they roll! And yet, at times, let kind regret be thine, Steal o'er thy charms, and shade them as they shine, For that thy Anna, from her friend away, Sighs 'mid the glories of the summer day! Thou say'st,—To me, now destined to remain In the joy-hallow'd groves, and conscious plain, Less irksome must our grieved disunion prove, Than rise to thee the pains of absent love, Torn as thou art, in all thy tender truth, From the dear haunts of our long happy youth; But sure, of parted friends, her lot we find Pressing the heaviest on the mournful mind, Who lingers where each object seems array'd In the fair semblance of the absent maid; Where bowers and lawns her stamp and image bear, At once, alas! so distant, and so near! And, to the aching heart, and tearful eye, Stand the mute spectres of departed joy. TIME PAST. WRITTEN JAN. 1773. Return, blest years! when not the jocund Spring, Luxuriant Summer, nor the amber hours Calm Autumn gives, my heart invoked, to bring Joys, whose rich balm o'er all the bosom pours; When ne'er I wish'd might grace the closing day, One tint purpureal, or one golden ray; When the loud storms, that desolate the bowers, Found dearer welcome than Favonian gales, And Winter's bare, bleak fields than Summer's flowery vales. Yet not to deck pale hours with vain parade, Beneath the blaze of wide-illumined dome; Not for the bounding dance;—not to pervade And charm the sense with music;—nor, as roam The mimic passions o'er theatric scene, To laugh, or weep;—O! not for these, I ween, But for delights, that made the heart their home, Was the grey night-frost on the sounding plain More than the sun invoked, that gilds the grassy lane. Yes, for the joys that trivial joys excel, My loved Honora, did we hail the gloom Of dim November's eve;—and, as it fell, And the bright fire shone cheerful round the room, Dropt the warm curtains with no tardy hand; And felt our spirits and our hearts expand; List'ning their steps, who still, where'er they come, Make the keen stars, that glaze the settled snows, More than the sun invoked when first he tints the rose. Affection,—Friendship,—Sympathy,—your throne Is winter's glowing hearth;—and ye were ours, Thy smile, Honora, made them all our own. Where are they now?—alas! their choicest powers Faded at thy retreat;—for thou art gone, And many a dark, long eve I sigh alone, In thrill'd remembrance of the vanish'd hours, When storms were dearer than the balmy gales, And the grey barren fields than green luxuriant vales. LICHFIELD, AN ELEGY. WRITTEN MAY 1781. Distinguish'd city! Whose name, and city-arms testify her military honours in ancient times. Addison's father being Dean of Lichfield, the infancy of that celebrated author was probably passed in her bosom; and it is well known what eminent men, in later days, were educated beneath her walls.—round thy lofty spires Bellona's spears, and Phœbus' golden lyres, Threw gleams of glory, whose unfading flame, Amidst thy country's annals, gilds thy name. Has Beauty made thee its peculiar care, Bade thee arise pre-eminently fair? Or do remember'd days, that swiftly flew, When life and all her blooming joys were new, To my thrill'd spirit emulously bring Illusions brighter than the shining Spring? Yet, independent of their glowing spell, Around thy spires exclusive graces dwell; For there alone the blended charms prevail Of city stateliness, and rural dale. High o'er proud towns where Gothic structures rise, How rare the freshness of unsullied skies! Oft cling to choral walls the mansions vile, Unseemly blots upon the graceful pile! Here not one squalid, mouldering cell appears, To mar the splendid toil of ancient years; But, from the basis to the stately height, One free and perfect whole it meets the sight, Adorn'd, yet simple, though majestic, light; While, as around that waving basis drawn, Shines the green surface of the level lawn, Full on its breast the spiral shadows tall, Unbroken, and in solemn beauty, fall. Near fanes, superb as these, how seldom found Exemption from the city's mingled sound; The iron rattling in the heavy drays, The rumbling coaches, and the whirling chaise; The clank of weary steeds, released the rein, That slowly seek the neighbouring pond, or plain; The town-cries, dinning from the crowded mart, And the loud hammers of assiduous art! Here (only when the organ's solemn sound Shall swell, or sink, the vaulted roofs around, While, from the full-voiced choir, the echoes bear The pealing anthem through the circling air,) No ruder voice the noon-day silence knows, Than birds soft warbling 'mid luxuriant boughs. For now in graceful freedom flow the trees. The trees of the cathedral walk at Lichfield are flowering limes, so beautiful when their branches are left to grow naturally. It is, however, only very lately that the tasteless custom has been renounced of lopping them to form a straight line at top. A barbarism, which existed when Major André was at Lichfield, and to which he alludes, with so much playful elegance, in the second of those charming letters subjoined to the Monody. That skirt the lawn, and wanton in the breeze. Their light arcades in soft perspective throw Stowe's shelter'd fields, that gently slope below;— Th' embosom'd lake, that, curling to the gale, Shines, the clear mirror of the sylvan vale; While on its bank, to humble virtue kind, Where still the poor man's prayers acceptance find, The mouldering tower, Stowe Church, said to be the mother church of this city, is older than its cathedral. that 'mid the shade appears, Green with the gather'd moss of countless years. There his pale corse may quiet shelter crave, As swells th' unequal turf with many a grave; And there the suns of summer-evening look, There tinge the waters of its huddling brook. We mark the villa, Two elegant houses, one at the foot, the other near the top of that umbrageous rising, which soon, but beautifully, bounds this valley to the east. They were built in the year 1756, by a lady of the Aston family, of whom frequent mention is made in Dr Johnson's letters to Mrs Piozzi, when she was Mrs Thrale. rising near the lake, And fairer she, that 'midst the verdant brake, From sultry gleam, and wintry tempest shrill, Stands softly curtain'd on the eastern hill; The suburb-cots, that to the right extend, And, half embower'd in village-semblance, bend Towards the lone, rustic spire, Green-Hill Church, belonging to the city. that stands serene Upon the south-hill top, and awes the smiling scene; While, save that to the left, o'er sloping fields, Her soft, blue glimpse the distant country yields, Closed are the gentle hills, that curve around, And form the beauteous valley's early bound; Throw every single feature it displays Distinct and forward on the placid gaze; Where nought disturbs, as soft the landscape glows, Its silent graces in their sweet repose. Now blends the liberal Spring thro' all the scene The blossoms, silvering 'mid their tender green; With king-cups gay each swelling mead she fills, And strews them yellow o'er the circling hills. Yet more majestic fanes may meet my gaze, And vallies, winding in a richer maze, But ah! 'tis those remember'd days that flew, When life and all her golden joys were new, That, beaming o'er the thrill'd remembrance, bring Illusions brighter than the lucid Spring. Compared with them, May's rosy morning spreads No poignant sweetness from her violet beds; Dim her bright noon, and rude her softest gale, And June's purpureal evening cold and pale. Days, that delight so vivid knew to bring, Why did ye hasten on so swift a wing? Ye taught angelic Friendship to impart Sweets from a lovely sister's Miss Sarah Seward. She died in her 19th year. The first poem in this collection is an Elegy to her memory. feeling heart. Mild was my Sarah as the vernal hours That ope the tender almond's blushing flowers; And O! blest days of Pleasure's soft increase, That rose in gladness, and that set in peace, Ye saw Honora, loveliest of the maids That deck'd our winter dome, our summer shades! What sweetness beaming o'er that peerless face! O'er that light form what animated grace! How did that mind's warm energies disdain Whate'er allures the haughty and the vain! How spurn the tinsel claims of wealth and birth! How cherish every gleam of wit and worth! What varying charms, in turn, ascendance gain'd, And in her voice, her air, her glances reign'd! Ninon's gay spirit, gladness to inspire, Lucretia's modesty, Cornelia's fire; O! of all hours was she!—Those hours are past, And the wide world contains her not!—such haste Make happy times to join the vanish'd train, That shadow'd o'er by grief, or rack'd by pain, In mercy fled:—but you, in light array'd, Why paused you not in Lichfield's bloomy shade? Why set your suns so soon, whose kindling rays Made all the summer of my youthful days? When first this month, stealing from half-blown bowers, Bathed the young cowslip in her sunny showers, Pensive I travell'd, and approach'd the plains, That met the bounds of Severn's wide domains. As up the hill I rose, from whose green brow The village church Weston, on the edge of Shropshire. o'erlooks the vale below, O! when its rustic form first met my eyes, What wild emotions swell'd the rising sighs! Stretch'd the pain'd heart-strings with the utmost force Grief knows to feel, that knows not dire remorse; For there—yes there,—its narrow porch contains My dear Honora's cold and pale remains, Whose lavish'd health, in youth, and beauty's bloom, Sunk to the silence of an early tomb. Thus, as I journied, grieved Reflection rose To meet the lone memorial of my woes, Honora's timeless grave;—then first beheld, Since, in that little porch, beside the field, It sunk neglected, while no stone remains To guard the sacred relics it contains. The wearied steeds, in languid pace and slow, Indulged the rising luxury of woe; With drooping neck, as they had shared my pain, Lingering they passed the solitary fane. Swift-rushing tears my straining eye-balls glazed, And thus my Spirit whispered as I gazed. “O! fairest among women!—dark and deep, Beneath that rude stone arch, thy lasting sleep! With all her woodland choir, resounding clear, The voice of Morning does not pierce thine ear; Gay Evening Suns, in Summer-glory drest, In vain look golden on thy bed of rest, Since from those rayless eyes their splendours fail To lift the dim impenetrable veil! “How early rose the intellectual powers In bloom, in strength, that shamed maturer hours! On that dear lip what mute attention hung, As dropt the precept from the Sage's tongue, While from his fruitful mind, in Science train'd, She caught the sense, ere language half explain'd! How soon did Genius all her soul engage! How glow'd those eyes along the Poet's page! What generous goodness taught that now cold heart To bear in others' joys so warm a part; Pour o'er another's woe the ready tear; Watch by the couch of pain with tender fear; Each wish prevent, each injury forgive, “And, heedless of herself, for others live!” “And is this all of my Honora's fate? O! wasted thus!—O! transient thus the date Of every excellence, that e'er combined To breathe perfection on the female mind! “Serene the day, and balmy is the gale; Spring's lucid hues are glistening o'er the vale; Blue gleams the lake A fine sheet of water near Weston-Hall, belonging to Lord Bradford. the circling trees between, And one sweet blackbird hymns the smiling scene. Thus mildly bright the hours of promise shine, But O! an all-resisting woe is mine; My soul not e'en the hours of promise cheer, And vernal music sickens on my ear; Peace, little warbler! mute forsake thy spray, Intrusive all the sweetness of thy lay; Or cease thy strain that cannot sooth my woes! Or wake Honora from her long repose.” Then roll'd the wheels, descending to the plain, Swift from the silent hill and rustic fane; Me to the life-warm scene Newport, the residence of the author's amiable friend, Mrs Short. they soon convey'd, When glad'ning eyes the mists of grief pervade. But to this vale Strow Valley, Lichfield. restored, where all I see, My dear Honora, seems so full of thee; Where not indeed thy pale remains are laid, But, warm with life, thou seem'st to deck the glade, I half reproach my heart, that gayer hours Beheld it yielding to the social powers; When the kind glance, and smile of friendship stole, At intervals, thy image from my soul! Ye shades of Lichfield, will ye always bring Illusions brighter than the shining spring? O! ere these eyes, that all our haunts explore With fond affection's gaze, shall ope no more, Lose not of her one consecrated trace, Whose image gives you this exclusive grace! Present it still, by Memory's potent aids, Ye choral turrets, and ye arching shades! Waft her remember'd voice in every gale! Wear her etherial smile, thou lovely vale, When Spring, in wayward April's veering days, Shoots the spruce foliage from the naked sprays; When Summer bids, thro' ev'ry splendid hour, Consummate beauty glow in ev'ry bower; When Autumn, turning back her golden eyes, Of parting Summer asks his varied dyes, With which she decks, but ah! to vanish soon, Her saffron morning, her pellucid noon; Nay, e'en when Winter sheds o'er the dim plains His shrouding snows, loud winds, and beating rains! Then, should or Fame, or Pleasure, to my ear Whisper that Talent blooms neglected here, Lure to the circles where congenial fire Might Emulation's generous warmth inspire; Yet here the spirit of departed joy Shall chain my step, shall fascinate my eye; Chace with his local spells awakening powers, Each languid consciousness of wasted hours; And o'er the present all that lustre cast That beams reflected from the fairer past. INVOCATION TO THE GENIUS OF SLUMBER. WRITTEN, OCT. 1787. Spirit of Dreams, that when the dark hours steep In the soft dews of life-embalming sleep, Our busy senses, canst restore the lost, The loved, the mourn'd, from Death's mysterious coast, Propitious lately to my votive lay, And the lone musing of the joyless day, From 'whelming years, and from sepulchral night, Thou gav'st Honora to my slumbering sight: Deck'd in those varied graces that array'd In youth's first bloom, the fair ingenuous maid; In all those pure affections gladd'ning powers, That wing'd with joy the animated hours, Alike when her sweet converse welcome made Morn's rising light, and Evening's stealthy shade; The months with flowers adorn'd, with radiance warm The vernal day, and e'en the wintry storm. She look'd, as in those golden years foregone, Spoke, as when love attuned each melting tone; When, by my side, her cautious steps she moved, Watching the friend solicitously loved, Whose youthful strength, in one disastrous day, Had fall'n to luckless accident a prey, And needed much, to save from future harm, The eye attentive, the supporting arm. Remember'd looks, ye rays of Friendship's flame, Long my soul's light, and guardians of my frame! Why, visionary Power, so seldom kind To the deprived, the life-retracing mind; Withholding oft, 'mid thy obtrusive swarm, My day-dream's idol, fair Honora's form? O! when thou giv'st it, then, and only then, Lost to my woes, I live with her again. Again on me those soft'ning eye-balls shine! I hear her speak! I feel her arm on mine! Real as fair, the tender pleasures glow, Sweet, as the past was potent to bestow, Freed from that sense which shrouds with dire controul Volition's image in a cypress stole; That tells me, searching wide creation o'er, My dear Honora I shall find no more; That on her lonely grave, and mouldering form, Six dreary winters poured the ruthless storm, Violent and dark as my soul's primal woe When first I found that beauteous head laid low. On that unshrined, yet ever-sacred spot, By faithless Love deserted and forgot, Six bloomy springs their crystal light have show'd, Their sun-gilt rains in fragrant silence flow'd, Mild as my sorrows (calm'd by passing years) Time-soften'd sighs, and time-assuaged tears. Once, as the taper's steady light convey'd Upon the white expanse the graceful shade Of sweet Honora's face, the traces fair My anxious hand pursued, and fixed them there; To throw, in spite of Fate's remorseless crimes, Soft soothing magic o'er succeeding times. For this dear purpose, near my couch I placed The shade, by Love assiduously traced; And, while no sullen curtain drops between, The image consecrates the sombrous scene; Serenely sweet it stands,—at morn, at eve, The first, last object these fond eyes perceive: And still my heart, and oft my lips address The shadowy form of her who lived to bless. Now strikes the midnight clock;—the taper gleams With the faint flash of half-expiring beams, And soon that lovely semblance shall recede, And Sleep's dim veils its thrilling powers impede. I feel their balmy, kind, resistless charms Creep o'er my closing eyes,—I fold my arms, Breathing in murmurs thro' the paly gloom, “Come to my dreams, my lost Honora, come! Back as the waves of Time benignly roll, Shew thy bright face to my enchanted soul!” MONODY ON MRS RICHARD VYSE, ADDRESSED TO HER HUSBAND, SINCE GENERAL VYSE. This poem was written the day before that lady's funeral, and in view of the villa where she died, in the Vale of Stowe, near Lichfield. I. 'Tis gloom, and silence all!—where late so gay The strains of pleasure in each gale were borne; Where white-robed Truth had fix'd her stedfast sway, And love's bright florets deck'd the rising morn. How constantly, beneath yon shade, The little, rosy Comforts play'd! While to the warblings of the plumy choir Responsive transport struck her golden lyre!— Thou dashing stream, swift hurrying down the glade, Oft has thy clear and sparkling wave convey'd The balmy whispers tender thoughts inspire, As shed the bridal star its gay enamour'd fire. II. Now through the vale a sullen stillness reigns, The shades embrown'd by woe, Frown o'er the house of death!—the blasted plains No more with beauty glow! Or is it Sorrow's misty shower That dims the hue of every flower, Draws from the lake the livid gleam, And hears the ominous raven scream?— Round Anna's bower the damps of horror rise, And shroud the splendours of the azure skies, Since she, who brighten'd summer's charms, Is torn in life's gay bloom, From young Ricardo's widow'd arms, The victim of the tomb. To that loved bower she shall no more return! Bend your dark tops, ye pines, and guard her sacred urn! III. Ah! gentle pair, your bliss was too refined, Too subtly sweet, too exquisite to last; For ne'er shall man unfading pleasures find, Where Grief, and Pain, may breathe the withering blast. How dire the ravage in that hour When sunk, beneath their baleful power, Each joy, bright springing from congenial taste, From warm impassion'd Love, from Friendship chaste; From Plenty, summon'd by approving Fate, To glide serenely through your open gate; From all that softens life, from all that cheers, And nurses Eden's rose in this chill vale of tear. IV. Rash man was made to mourn:—exempt alone Who transport ne'er have felt; Whose hearts, girt round by Dulness' leaden zone, Nor Love, nor Pity melt; On whose dead calm of vacant hours Nor Rapture beams, nor Anguish lours.— Lone mourner o'er thy Anna's grave, Since Youth and Love were weak to save, Thy fruitless sorrows with this truth controul, Soft whispering to thy fond, thy faithful soul, That all the woes, which shroud thy noon-tide rays, Bend thee to earth, and lay thy prospects waste; Are borne for her, whose fair, unclouded days Of wintry storm had never felt the blast; The large arrears of grief she must have paid, Had she not early sunk in death's eternal shade. V. O! think, had fell disease assaulted thee, The rushing fever, or the slow decline, These sufferings had been hers—this agony Wrung her mild bosom, that now tortures thine; And shall not her far happier doom Gild, with its seraph rays, thy gloom? Since sun-eyed Faith empowers thee to pervade The dreary grave's incumbent shade; Lift its dark curtains from the regions bright, And see thy love ascend her throne of light, Where bliss, that ne'er shall end, and ne'er can cloy, Succeeds your nuptial year of seldom equall'd joy. TO MRS COLTMAN OF HULL. OCTOBER 1772. Bright as the dew-drop on the brow of morn, Fair as the lily by the fountain side, Sweet as the damask rose-bud, newly born On verdant banks, where glassy rivers glide, Thou, Isabella, in the vale of life, Far from Ambition's paths art charm'd to stray, Shunning the haunts of pride and envious strife, Each Muse, each Grace, companions of thy way. Thy winter's cheerful hearth, thy summer suns, May attic wit and virtue still adorn! Brightning thy destin'd hour-glass as it runs, Crowning thy night with peace, with joy thy morn! Long may Hygeia lead thee to her springs, And with full draughts thy glowing lip bedew! And while Prosperity her garland brings, May nought that blesses bid thee once adieu! RECEIPT FOR A SWEET JAR. Through freezing hours would you pervade your rooms With each fine odour of the summer-blooms, Learn from the Muse to form the fragrant spell, And bid her rhymes its artful process tell. When Spring's first sweets the pendant violets pour, Strew, with unsparing hand, that lovely flower; When Fraxanella's spicy sighs exhale, And pale Syringas languish on the gale; When all the aromatic tribe entwine Their vernal garlands round Hygeia's shrine, Crop the rich spoils beneath the noon-day sun, And be with these thy grateful task begun! Then when the nymph, that decks the glowing year, Bids to the day her loveliest boast appear, As her gay rose expands its crimson gems, Of the bright offspring rob the parent stems; From noon to noon the splendid foliage lay, The added heaps shall added sweets convey; And scarce less liberally, to swell thy hoard, Her spikes let azure lavender afford; From orange-groves be silvery blooms consign'd, With starry jessamine of scent refined. From the soft umbrage of Idalian bowers Bid graceful myrtles shed their blossom'd showers; And, emulous of raspberry's tempting sweet, Let mignionets their floral sisters greet. With cinnamon let cloves and mace descend, And in the marble vase their virtues blend, One ounce of each;—and then, with sparing hand, Bid luscious musk his potent scent expand, A few small grains;—dispersing 'mid the rest, No sick'ning odours shall the sense molest, But, when time mellows their too cloying power, They shall increase the sweets of spice and flower. Yet liberal most the snowy mineral spread Between each layer, in sparkling plenty shed, Since where bright Salt her crystalines extends, She brings an active host of powerful friends, To whose pervading and protecting sway, Fell Dissolution yields his languid prey. And you, who wish your breathing flowers may rise With scent primeval, on December's skies, Still, as you spread them, every layer between, Profusely let this white preserver gleam, While scantier sprinklings of the spicy dust, By art thus blended, aid the poignant gust. And let each rising morn behold with care Thy busy fingers mix each former layer; And be that task renew'd when setting light Resigns her faded empire to the night. So shall no taint pollute thy treasured flowers, No must offensive foil their fragrant powers; But odours, rich as those of Saba's vale, Rise on hybernal Albion's bleakest gale, Sweets, which the breath of her gay months excells, While in thy vase eternal summer dwells. INVOCATION TO THE SHADE OF PETRARCH, AND TO THE SPIRITS OF THE PERSIAN POETS, ON THEIR COMPOSITIONS BEING TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH, BY SIR WILLIAM JONES. This was written when first Sir William's Oriental Miscellany appeared. Boast of Italian plains, that once did'st rove Where lucid Sorga leads her winding wave From its deep fountain in Valclusa's grove, Whose lavish laurels in her waters lave, Thou, who so oft hast struck the silver shell To hopeless Love, and wedded Laura's charms, See passing ages yet enchanted dwell, On thy sweet verse, and feel thy soft alarms! Ah! sacred shade of that enamour'd youth, Still shall thy myrtles bloom with fairest hue, While one kind tear descends from tender Truth, Again each fading blossom to renew. But share those myrtles with that minstrel bland, Whose skill afresh hath strung thy silver lyre, And taught the echoes of his native land The plaint harmonious of thy fond desire. With him your bright poetic honours share, You that awaked the song on Mithra's plains, Breath'd your wild warblings on the fragrant air, And at the fount of light illumed your strains. The veils that hid you thro' the rounds of time From European eyes, are torn away, And all the fire of oriental rhyme Glows in our isle with undiminish'd ray: Spirits of eastern bards, where'er shall rove Your British guardian, from your musky vales, Sun-hallow'd hills, and each odorous grove, Bring the rich incense that perfumes your gales! O'er his young head the spicy treasures blend, And from your brightest gems a crown obtain! On him may all the tribute stores descend Who hung with Persian wreaths the Albion Muses' fane! ODE TO WILLIAM BOOTHBY, ESQ. WRITTEN IN THE SUMMER 1775. Ere yet Alexis bend his purposed way The Peak's rude rocks and devious vales among, O! may he pause, and, listening to my lay, Accept the moral precept of the song! And ye, blest sisters of th' inspiring spring, Too partial, cease to wander and to sing Where Arethusa's silver fountain flows! Or, if Castalian plains ye haunt, ah, bend Your steps where rival scenes extend, And every varied tint of beauty glows, Mix'd with the spirit of the mountain gale, Whose stolen perfumes float and wanton o'er the vale! There, under pendant rocks, his amber flood, As Hebrus swift, impetuous Derwent pours; And now, beneath the broad, incumbent wood, Silent and smooth and deep, he laves the shores; Till, gaily rushing from his darksome way, His foamy waters glitter on the day, Resistless, dashing o'er each rugged mound; And still, on his umbrageous bank, he shows Woodbines and harebells and the musky rose, The heavy, velvet wild bees murmuring sound. His every grace that decks Pieria's clime, Green vale, and steepy hill, and broken rock sublime. Here, in meanders swift, the silver Wie The river Wie runs through Mensaldale, the loveliest of the Peak Vallies, and through the rich meads below Bakewell, where it winds and curves with capricious wantonness. The waters of the Derwent have a tint of amber, which seems to suit the dark and luxuriant foliage on their banks, and is well contrasted by the white foam, almost perpetually formed by its rocky channel. The clearness of the Wie is still more beautiful. Hence it becomes the mirror of the exquisite scenery on its borders. Wantons around the Naiads of his wave, Thro' scenes, where mighty Nature's spirit free Each coy and wood-wild grace luxuriant gave. Behold, in lucid beauty, from the tide Rise his kind nymphs, and for the race that glide With sinuous track, and in their eddies play, Ask mercy!—Wilt thou then, with barbarous care, Th' unreal insect, false and fair, Seductive fling along their glassy way? Hasten, ye Muses, from Sicilian glades, The guiltless tenants guard of these all-lovely shades! And may your strains a purer joy impart, And cruel purposes in pity melt! Humane of song! O steal into his heart, Till life-destroying hopes no more are felt! Tell him how much profaned that eye benign, By Nature form'd with other fires to shine, Love's ardent beam, and Mercy's dewy ray, How much profaned, when, with inhuman lour, Its deathful level streams!—ah, pour The sacred strain, and save the tender prey! Avert each cruel, unresisted blow, Tell him, no laureate meeds for such achievements grow! Of wasted hours may generous minds beware, Nor fatal be their strength, their skill, their speed! Link'd with the Graces, lo, the Nine appear! Hark, how they warn thee from each ruthless deed! Now, while thy life's purpureal moments reign, Rove with these guardian nymphs, hill, dale, and plain! Their zones shall gird thee, and their lays inspire, Storing each sense with permanent delight; That, when thy youth has wing'd its flight, When faded all the tints of gay desire, On the mild evening of thy vital day Science and Taste may shine with cloud-dispelling ray! ODE This Ode is an answer to Mr Boothby's verses on the preceding Ode, which verses he sent to the author from Tunbridge. TO BROOKE BOOTHBY, ESQ. AFFERWARDS SIR BROOKE BOOTHBY. Not yet is it reveal'd, ye sacred Nine, If, with humane accordance to my lay, Ye rear'd, in Peak's sweet vales, your rocky shrine, And lured Alexis from the sylvan prey.— That late his brother's chorded shell Ye struck, its charming numbers tell; They bear the symbols of your quire, Aonian sweetness, Attic fire; So prompt with happiest melody to flow When your Hilario strikes the lyre; And with the clearest light to glow, As gay or pensive themes his song inspire.— All uninvoked, upon Hilario's brows, Each rival Muse and Grace her loveliest garland throws. Flying from shades, which veil the sultry day, From gales, that breathe the essence of the spring, From streams, where pearly-wristed Naiads play, From echoes, faithful to each tuneful string, The muses seek yon garish plain, Tunbridge. Haunt of the frolic and the vain.— Forsaken Nine! Hilario there Leads in light dance a mortal fair, And all your soft and silver harps are drown'd Amid the viol's scrannel noise, And hautboy's loud, metallic sound, Skilless, yet suiting well such vulgar joys, As, with the wanderer, ye reluctant rove Far from poetic plain, or Learning's hallow'd grove. For the moist, orient lustres, as they stream, Sloping and trembling on the mazy rill, The splendours of the white meridian beam, That warms the vale, and flames upon the hill, Eve's crimson throne, and golden rays, The lustre's many-pointed blaze A noon-day night profusely pours, Of gaudy violated hours; And for the shining locks, the rural crown, The wavy robe, so light and free, That flows thy agile limbs adown, And decks thy smiling brow, Simplicity, Quaint Fashion, by her own trim fingers drest, Pranks, with a vacant smile, her stiff, fantastic vest. Ah! more than potent is the myrtle chain, Since Folly can a heart like thine ensnare! While kindred Genius views thee with disdain, Loit'ring, and listening to each idiot fair. Resigning thus thy wasted day, Exclusive own Love's magic sway, If thus his fires delusive lead Thy charmed foot to marshy mead, Where sinks its languid step, tho' form'd to gain The height sublime, where brightly glows, Above the gems that deck the vain, The sweet, unfading, scientific rose: But thou, since meaner garlands bind thy brows, Boast not those rival claims thy despot disallows! In allusion to his verses which maintain that love may subsist with rival passions. See the elegant edition of his Poems, published 1796, by Cadell, page 59. The strongest bias of the youthful soul Love's dark magnetic instantly can turn; Behold the Bacchanal forsake his bowl, The fierce grow gentle, and the stoic burn! Sylvan Diana's cruel sports Too long thy graceful brother courts; But ah! though deaf to Julia's lay, Had one bright nymph adjured his stay, Would the warm youth have sought the buskin'd train? Ah no! attentive to her sigh, Their echoing horns might wind in vain; No shaft of his had fleeted thro' the sky; The victim in the sacrificer found, Pierced by a keener dart, had spared the purposed wound. And do not now the Nine successless plead, From scenes, where only syren pleasures sing, Hilario's steps they might assiduous lead Back to his wonted haunt, their hallow'd spring? In vain applause her pæan breathes, And ardent knowledge twines her wreaths; For him extracts each pedant thorn, Ere yet his brows those wreaths adorn. Ah me! the magic of enamour'd smiles, The tender glance, disorder'd air, With all the soft voluptuous wiles, That wind round lofty souls the fatal snare, Shall mock thy late proud boast, and force thee own Thy baby Godhead sits despotic on his throne. SONGS. THE COUNTRY MAID, A PASTORAL BALLAD. An easy heart adorns the vale, And gilds the lonely plain; No sighs of mine increase the gale, No peevish tears the rain. From happy dreams, the orient beams Awake my soul to pleasure; With cheek that glows, I milk my cows, And bless the flowing treasure. To tend the flock thro' summer's day Is surely no disgrace; A wreath of leaves from noon-tide ray Defends my shaded face. Industrious heed the hours shall speed On pinions gay and light; The rising thought, with virtue fraught, Shall consecrate their flight. A maple dish, a cedar spoon, Seem fair and sweet to me, When, on a violet bank, at noon, I sit, and dine with glee. From crystal rill my cup I fill, And praise the bounteous giver; Nor with the great would change my state, But dwell in vales for ever. I love to mark the sultry hour, When Phœbus ardent glows, How deeply still are plain and bower In undisturb'd repose; All but the rills, that down the hills Their glittering waters fling, And round the bowers, on sweet, wild flowers, The bees, that murmuring cling. When eve's grey mantle veils the sun, And hill's late gilded height; When green banks whiten, as the moon Sheds wide her milky light, I mark the vales and shadowy dales, In soft perspective showing; Their winding streams, beneath her beams, In trembling lustre flowing. Then homeward my pleased steps I bend To yonder ivied cottage, Where parents dear and gentle friend Prepare the savoury pottage. The wholesome fare, the pious prayer, Conclude my day so pleasant! Ye rich and proud, confess aloud Right happy such a peasant. (j.) SONG. The first verse is from an old ballad. [Florio, by all the Powers above] Florio, by all the Powers above, “Plighted to me eternal love; “And as a rose adorn'd my breast, “He on its leaf the vow impress'd; “But, while the winds did round us play, “Vow, leaf, and promise blew away.” For this, when summer mornings glow, O! shall I veil their beams in woe? And 'mid the rosy hours of youth, Weep and repine o'er vanish'd truth? No! let me hail the shining day, Blithe as the lark, that meets its ray. Beauty and Health have joys that prove Balm for the wounds of slighted love; And when a faithful lover gains The heart, a false one now disdains, Ungrateful Damon may deplore What vain regret shall ne'er restore. Celia to Florio then shall say, “Vow, leaf, and promise, blew away;” And to those winds I gave my grief, That bore the love-recorded leaf; Nor do I chide the gales, or thee, Since thou art false—and I am free! And, till return those hours of prime, Borne on the onward stream of time; Yes, till the spring restores to me That very leaf inscribed by thee, Scorning thy sighs, shall Celia say, “Vow, leaf, and promise, blew away!” ACHILLES, Written on request, for music. A CANZONET. RECITATIVE. Achilles roams the damp and sounding shore, Nor hears th' approaching tempest's sullen roar; Indignant mourns, by rage and anguish toss'd, His honour stain'd, his fair Briseis is lost! AIR. —Bass. Mix'd with the rising wind his groan;— Mark it, proud Troy! the welcome sound Respites thine altars and thy throne, Tho' fierce Tydides thunder round. ACHILLES. AIR. —Amoroso. “My Maid, my black-eyed Maid,” deprived of thee, Life has no joy, and love no charm for me! AIR.— Bravoura. Tyrant, 'tis well!—in baffled combat long Thy vanquish'd myriads shall avenge this wrong! PRECEDING AIR RESUMED. But ah! nor love, nor glory, now I boast, Brightly they shone, now darken'd each, and lost. CHORUS. Hero, to thee shall great revenge remain, And Grecian armies strew the Trojan plain! SONG. [The, mute grey fields, and leafless bowers] The, mute grey fields, and leafless bowers Now vainly wait the vernal hours; Yet vernal hours to them will come, Awake the song, and ope the bloom. To me more dear than vernal hours To mute grey fields and leafless bowers, Were Damon's accents, Damon's strain, But Damon speaks, nor sings again! On him hath closed the silent door Shall never, never open more, And on my heart, by nought consoled, The trembling hand of Hope is cold! And bleak fields suit, and suits this iron sky The lonely spirit of departed joy. SONG. [My Stella sleeps, the sultry hour] Recitative. My Stella sleeps, the sultry hour Seals her soft eye-lids in the bower, And see, the snowy rose she wore Is fallen upon the verdant floor. Air. Ah Rose, thou hast fled from a throne Where thy fairness and scent are out-done, And the graces that rival thy own Thy envy has taught thee to shun. And O! since thy thorns might annoy A breast all the graces adorn, To the mansion of love and of joy, Pale Rover! thou shalt not return. SONG. [On a mount a cottage stands] On a mount a cottage stands Half way down the sunny side, And a little vale commands Where the glassy waters glide. There ascends a curtain'd hill, From the stormy north it shields; At its foot a church and mill, Clustering hedgerows, narrow fields. Pleasant, pleasant is the scene When the spring and summer shine, Yet within that cot, I ween, Dwells a fairer love of mine. Her sweet smile a spirit pours Which, when blooming seasons fail, Lovelier makes than summer bowers Winter's grey and naked vale. BALLAD. [I wake and weep, when wintry winds] I wake and weep, when wintry winds Are howling loud upon the lea, And louder blasts my fancy finds For William, on the foaming sea; But, calming soon the pictured storm, Sweet hopes into my bosom creep, And tell me, summer breezes warm Shall waft him safely o'er the deep. Four years, on India's sultry coast, Has war's rude voice my love detain'd; While here, to every pleasure lost, His Mary's languid form remain'd; And o'er the steep rock still to lean, Still eager watch each gliding sail, That languid form is duly seen, At ruddy morn, and evening pale. But ah! no handkerchief I mark Stream from the deck in crimson dye! Dear signal! wanting thee, the bark Is hail'd by many a mournful sigh. Its shouts discordant seem to me, That echo from the stony pier, Since William's face I cannot see, Since William's voice I cannot hear. SONG OF THE FAIRIES TO THE SEA-NYMPHS. Hasten, from your coral caves, Every nymph that sportive laves In the green sea's oozy wells, And gilds the fins, and spots the shells! Hasten, and our morrice join, Ere the gaudy morning shine! Rising from the foamy wave, Instant now your aid we crave; Come, and trip like our gay band, Traceless on the amber sand. Haste! or we must hence away, Yet an hour, and all is day! At your bidding, from our feet Shall the ocean monsters fleet, Sea-nettle and sting-fish glide Back upon the refluent tide. Haste! the dawn has streak'd the cloud, Haste! the village cock has crow'd. See! the clouds of night retire, Hesper gleams with languid fire! Quickly then our revel join, The blush of morn is on the brine! Loiterers, we must hence away, Yonder breaks the orb of day. SONG [Bleak gloomy winds will surely rise] ADAPTED TO THE NEW AIR IN PLEYEL'S GRAND CONCERTANTE. Bleak gloomy winds will surely rise, When autumn hastes away; Ah! so shall swell my rising sighs, So wintry grow my day. Lost to my view, when Cloe's form No more adorns this shade; Then, O then, must Sorrow's storm My drooping soul invade. Fast falling tears bedew the ground When dark November lours, Nor yet less lavish will be found, These eyes' descending showers. Doom'd when I feel my sick'ning heart To wail its vanish'd joys; Now, e'en now, the dreaded smart My present bliss destroys. Cease, Fancy, cease the golden prime Of Love's delights to veil; Cease to present the cruel time When every joy must fail! Live while we may,—'tis all we can, And shun the thought that mourns! Crown with roses life's short span, But lean not on their thorns! SONG. [In sylvan scenes, when Laura hails] In sylvan scenes, when Laura hails The flowers that deck the grove, Ye Dryads, in the passing gales, O! whisper to my love! And tell her, as she smiling views The beauteous vernal train, How short a time their splendid hues And breathing sweets remain. Soft in the dells, when silver streams From bubbling fountains stray, Ye Naiads, guide the waking dreams That o'er her fancy stray! And when she sees, thro' meads and groves, The waters swiftly glide, Inspire the thought, that youthful hours No longer tarriance bide! Then, Venus, come! and tell the Fair Those rosy hours are thine; And bid her snowy hands prepare The marriage wreath to twine. Since flowers and streams, and youth and love, So rapid fleet away, O teach my Laura to improve The time that will not stay! BALLAD. [Hast thou escaped the cannon's ire] Hast thou escaped the cannon's ire, Loud thundering o'er the troubled main? Hast thou escaped the fever's fire, That burnt so fierce on India's plain? Then, William, then I can resign, With scarce one sigh, the blooming grace, Which in thy form was wont to shine, Which made so bright thy youthful face. That face grows wan by sultry clime, By watching dim those radiant eyes; But Valour gilds the wrecks of Time, Tho' youth decays, tho' beauty flies; An honest heart is all to me, Nor soil, nor time, makes that look old; And dearer shall the jewel be Than youth, or beauty, fame, or gold. SONG. [The stormy ocean roving] I The stormy ocean roving, My William seeks the foe; Ah me! the pain of loving, To war when lovers go! II O! why my locks so yellow, Should rosy garlands bind, When trembles yonder willow, As blows the sullen wind? III Ye nymphs, who feel no anguish, My garlands gay ye wove, But I in absence languish, And fear for him I love. IV Nor yet the sprays of willow Shall wave my temples o'er, But weeds, that ocean's billow Leaves dark upon the shore. V Pale willows suit the sorrow The fair forsaken knows; Fierce War has wing'd the arrow That wounds my soul's repose. VI Sad on the beach I linger, And watch the altering sea; But no cold doubts shall injure, My love is true to me! VII Yet, till rest crown my pillow, Till peace my love restore, Be mine the weeds yon billow Leaves dark upon the shore! ADDRESS TO HOPE. SONG. Thou sun of the spirit, dispersing each cloud, When the sad sense of danger my bosom would shroud, Not Spring, as she chases the Winter's loud storm, Ever blest the chill earth with a lustre so warm. O! how had I borne the dire thoughts of the fray, When War's cruel voice call'd my lover away, Had'st not thou, gentle Hope, veil'd the battles' increase, And bent thy soft beams on the harbour of Peace! To cheer and irradiate a bosom like mine, Can the splendour of Glory be potent as thine? It plays on the crest of the hero, but shews Red traces of danger thro' legions of foes; It gilds e'en destruction, I know, to the brave, But to love, what can brighten the gloom of the grave? Then do thou draw a veil o'er the battle's fierce gleams, And on Safety's dear harbour O! bend thy soft beams! And now, gentle Hope, art thou faithful as kind, Not false were thy fires while they shone on my mind; My hero returns!—the dread danger is o'er, And, crown'd with new laurels, he speeds to the shore; Yet to light the dim Future, sweet Hope, do not cease, Thro' life let thy torch be the guard of my peace; That still it may gild the warm day-spring of youth, As it shone on his safety, now shine on his truth. SONG. [My Celia vow'd, at early dawn] My Celia vow'd, at early dawn, To meet me on the blossom'd lawn; And now the dewy light of morn, Arising, gems the silver thorn; But, hush'd in sleep, my fair one now Forgets, alas! her tender vow! Gay linnets carol from the hill, And sparkling flows the mountain rill; Wild rose and woodbine scent the gale, And breathe their perfumes thro' the vale; But, hush'd in sleep, my charmer laid, Forgets the tender vow she made. Come, lovely nymph, they seem to say, Adorn with us the rising day! For charms like thine alone can bring The joys that crown the breathing Spring; In vain her songs, her beauties rise, If faithless Slumber seals those eyes! SONG. [Here is the bank I loved so well] Here is the bank I loved so well, But all its flowers are shrunk away! And here the lately verdant dell, Where I and Henry used to stray! Ah me! I sigh, and look around, No marks of what it was remain, Save yon rude rock, that wept and frown'd, When gay the bower, and green the plain! While happy, under summer skies, We gazed upon its dropping brow, I little thought how soon these eyes With as perpetual tears should flow. If once this heart to love were cold, And man's base falsehood could divine, O! I would sell my youth for gold, My marriage vow at Plutus' shrine. Then alter'd looks I should not mourn, The faithless glance I should not see; The false one leave me, or return, 'Twould then be all the same to me. 'Tis not the blast, that piercing blows, 'Tis not the rains, that beating pour; I mourn not what their rage may do, To thin my flock, and blight my bower. Nor nightly were my bosom bare To all their wild inclemency, I would not shed this bitter tear, But Henry's love grows cold to me! Pass a few months, and we behold Time lead again the blooming Spring, But ne'er shall Time to hearts grown cold, Again the vanish'd kindness bring. SONG, FROM METASTATIO. [Mild breeze, when thou shalt fan my fair] Mild breeze, when thou shalt fan my fair, Tell her a sigh augments thy gales; But to reveal the source forbear, From whence thy gentle breath exhales. Clear stream, if thou her step shalt meet, Say, with a tear thy currents swell, But do not to the nymph repeat, From whose enamour'd lid it fell. SONG. [In the mid-day of summer, and far from the shade] In the mid-day of summer, and far from the shade, Beneath a steep rock, a young shepherd was laid; The roses of beauty had paled on his face, Yet each look was expressive, each motion was grace. Thus flow'd his soft numbers;—and strange that a swain, With such eyes, and such numbers, should languish in vain! Ye fierce beams of noon, on my bosom that dart, How languid your heat to the flames in my heart! The breezes attemper the fervours of day, But what can my passion for Chloris allay? Not the wild breath of Anger its fires can assuage, Not the ice of Indifference extinguish its rage. That frozen indifference unpitied I mourn, Neglected I leave her, unmark'd I return; No sigh for my pain, and no smile for my joy, No transport can melt her, no anger annoy; Yet still, self-supported, tho' hopeless my flame, Like the lamp monumental, 'tis ever the same. SONG OF A NORTHERN LOVER, IN WINTER. The dark winds are blowing around the rude hill, And the ice of the evening has crusted the rill; Thy waves, O Loch Lomond! can glitter no more, But in dim, stony fragments incumber thy shore. And now for the moon, looking mild on the brook, Swift lights of the north thro' the zenith are struck; Those flashes, pale streaming, will guide my lone way, And the steps of a lover in safety convey. Then louder the wings of the winter may sound, And the frost's cutting arrows dart keener around, So the white shrouding flakes of the snow Snow, covering mines, pits, and pools, slightly frozen, in mountainous countries, is imminently dangerous, especially where there are no turnpike roads. are withheld, From the mine of the heath, and the lake of the field SONG. [If stormy, o'er enamell'd vales] If stormy, o'er enamell'd vales, Keen Eurus sweeps with blighting sway, When Zephyr's mild and balmy gales Had waked the bloom of orient May, That orient bloom at once is lost, She droops forlorn in silent bowers; And sighs, amid untimely frost, For glowing suns and silver showers. So droops my heart, that trembling feels The power of Stella's icy scorn; Each rising joy her frown repels, And wintry grows my summer morn. Ah, Stella! cold and cruel maid! Eternal shall that winter prove? And wretched in the lonely glade Must injured Truth despair of Love? PASTORAL BALLAD. O! share my cottage, dearest maid! Beneath a mountain, wild and high, It nestles in a silent glade, And a clear river wanders by. Each tender care, each honest art, Shall chase all future want from thee, If thy sweet lips consent impart To climb these craggy hills with me. Far from the city's vain parade, No scornful brow shall there be seen; No dull Impertinence invade, Nor Envy base, nor sullen Spleen; The shadowy rocks, that circle round, From storms shall guard our sylvan cell, And there shall every joy be found That loves in peaceful vales to dwell. When late the tardy sun shall peer, And faintly gild you little spire; When nights are long, and frosts severe, And our clean hearth is bright with fire, Sweet tales to read! sweet songs to sing! O! they shall drown the wind and rain, E'en till the soften'd season bring Merry spring-time back again! Then hawthorns, flowering in the glen, Shall guard the warbling feather'd throng; Nor boast the busy haunts of men So fair a scene, so sweet a song. Thy arms the new-yean'd lamb will shield, And to the sunny shelter bear, While, o'er the rough and breathing field, My hands impel the gleaming share. Ne'er doubt our wheaten ears will rise, And full their yellow harvest grow; Then taste with me the sprightly joys That Love and Industry bestow! Their jocund power can banish strife, Her clouds no passing day will see, Since all the leisure hours of life Shall still be spent in pleasing thee. SONG. [From thy waves, stormy Lannow, I fly] From thy waves, stormy Lannow, I fly; From the rocks, that are lash'd by their tide; From the maid, whose cold bosom, relentless as they, Has wreck'd my warm hopes by her pride!— Yet lonely and rude as the scene, Her smile to that scene could impart A charm, that might rival the bloom of the vale— But away, thou fond dream of my heart! From thy rocks, stormy Lannow, I fly! Now the blasts of the winter come on, And the waters grow dark as they rise! But 'tis well!—they resemble the sullen disdain That has lour'd in those insolent eyes. Sincere were the sighs they represt, But they rose in the days that are flown! Ah, nymph! unrelenting and cold as thou art, My spirit is proud as thine own. From thy rocks, stormy Lannow, I fly! Lo! the wings of the sea-fowl are spread To escape the loud storm by their flight; And these caves will afford them a gloomy retreat From the winds and the billows of night; Like them, to the home of my youth, Like them, to its shades I retire; Receive me, and shield my vex'd spirit, ye groves, From the pangs of insulted desire! To thy rocks, stormy Lannow, adieu! GLEE. Now Spring wakes the May-morn, the sweetest of hours Calls the lark to the sun-beam, the bee to the flowers; Calls Youth, Love, and Beauty to hail the new day, And twine their gay garlands in honour of May; Yet hope not, amid the soft pleasures they bring, That moments so jocund will pause on their wing! Obey, my fair Laura, the summons that breathes In the hue of the trees, in the scent of the wreaths, In the song of the woodlands, for love is the lay, And lustre and perfume are types of his sway; More tuneful his accents, more rosy his spring, And O! not less rapid the flight of his wing! ODE TO EUPHROSYNE, AN EPITHALAMIUM ON THE MARRIAGE OF DOCTOR D? AND MISS M?. Daughter of Heaven, and friend of earth, Who fear'st no cloud upon thy rosy light, Parent of Health, and Wit, and Mirth, Dispensing permanence to gay delight, Euphrosyne, this sacred hour, Consecrate the mutual vow!— Impassion'd Love must twine his wreath in vain, And vainly gild the nuptial chain, If thou should'st rove more favour'd scenes among, Goddess of my rising song! Of texture frail then would each joy be form'd, And care must chill the hearts enamour'd transport warm'd. Queen of the dimpled smile, be near, Thy influence on the bridal garland breathe! Since oft the buds of nightshade darkly peer Beneath the sprays of that envermeil'd wreath, Too prone are Grief, Disease, and Care, To slide those mournful emblems there; And oft, with pallid lip and furrow'd brows, Jealousy remorseless throws Fires on the marriage flame, which soon expand, And change it to a livid brand; But thou, gay Goddess, with auspicious mien Hymen's bright torch can'st guard, his blooming garland screen. Come then, on the morning gale, Chasing every demon pale! So flies the mist when Phoebus gleams, Pierced thro' and thro' with arrowy beams Come then, and the lovers hail, Worthy all thy dear caressing, Liveliest smile, and fondest blessing!— Venus bade the youth inherit Love, and virtues that endure; Flames, which fired the lover's spirit, When time was young, and faith was pure. Not gay Leander with more ardour warm When his firm nerves each rising dread withstood; When, braving night,—the sea,—the howling storm, He plough'd the billows of the Euxine flood. This plighted pair should midnight waves divide, As bold an arm would stem the loud, conflicting tide. A deep glen hides his chosen maid, The tender flower of that sequester'd vale; In the sweet lily's charms array'd, When from the sun its folding leaves conceal The bending cups of purest snow, Whence its lavish perfumes flow. So dwells, beneath that modest air, A soul, as her complexion fair, As her quick blush, and sunny tresses warm; Mindless to fear, or practise harm, No cold distrust repels its fervent glow, Closes her liberal hand, or shades her smiling brow. Credulity, of Virtue born, With the swift-springing drop of pity's dew, In mild simplicity, adorn, And shed o'er her ripe youth their freshest hue; While Taste, arranging Fancy's stores, A clear libation gently pours Incessant on the texture of her mind; By the sparkling streams refined From rust opake, and from the misty stains Which languid indolence retains. Haste then, Euphrosyne, and bless the shrines, Where the dear artless maid her plighted hand resigns! Be the faithful, generous pair, Goddess, thy incessant care! Wave thou still, with jocund mirth, Thy light wand o'er their glowing hearth, Where drops no briny tear! Wave it, when wintry storms are yelling Loud around their cheerful dwelling; When summer rays, the year adorning, Bless each mountain, dale, and plain, Light again the crystal morning, Gild the splendent noon again; Or tinge the purple clouds of beauteous eve, Slowly that fade into the stealing night.— O! may each veering scene from thee receive White tints of peace, and pleasure's ruddy light! Since absent thou, how dim our youthful days, Thou, who canst more illume the gorgeous, solar blaze! PROLOGUE WRITTEN FOR THE TRAGEDY OF BRAGANZA. On Britain's stage, when Roman Portia charms, And female grace with manly courage arms, Each sex alike her daring virtues fire, The fair exult, and all the brave admire. Beyond her Brutus' life the public weal Nobly she loves, and animates his zeal, But soon the o'er-strain'd cords of courage break, And fatal madness triumphs o'er the wreck. More self-sustain'd, pride of a recent age, Louisa's radiance gilds the historic page, Her portrait here, display'd in faithful light, A virgin muse exhibits to your sight. She pleads the unpractised hand of truant Youth, But boasts the sacred patronage of Truth. Oft have you wept Elfrida's fancied woes, Charm'd with each virtue that her bard bestows; While Truth indignant fled the varnish'd theme, He cloth'd the faithless fair with worth supreme; Each shrinking voice confess'd the touch refined, That chased the Ethiop blackness of her mind. O! let those tears for bright Louisa stream, Around whose brows the genuine virtues beam! Contempt of death, in Freedom's glorious cause, By sterner manhood shown, demands applause; Such glorious heights when softer woman soars, Awaken'd Sympathy her tribute pours; The heart's quick throb, sweet sigh, and raptured tear, For Love and Beauty, that so greatly dare. Oft has your rigid justice been disarm'd When graceful Cleopatra spoke and charm'd. Still the imperial criminal inspires Some kind compassion for unhallow'd fires, Tho' worlds ill-lost o'erwhelm her hero's fame, And victim millions curse the guilty flame; Yet still, beneath her self-inflicted fate, Her death, by the application of the Asp. You feel her guilty, but confess her great; Own the rash deed high-soul'd,—in that dark time Stampt with no dire reproach, no impious crime. Long years of error thus the generous mourn, When Courage clasps the expiatory urn. A purer spirit now demands acclaim, True patriot virtue in a female frame, And more than Roman firmness.—In that cause, Ye Britons, mitigate the critics' laws! For her dear sake, who your own spirit breathes, Adorn her poet with your honour'd wreaths! On you his hopes, on you his fears await, Your smile is glory, and your frown is fate. PROLOGUE WRITTEN FOR MR PENN. An itinerant performer of great ability, whom indiscretion, and an extravagant wife, had prevented from attaining better situations, which his talents would have adorned. This prologue was spoken by him very finely, for his benefit, at Birmingham, in the spring 1782. With Nature's truth, be it the actor's care, By turns, each passion's varied form to wear; Assume the joy, the grief, the fear, the rage, That charm, and thrill, and fire the scenic page; Bid Rowe, bid Otway's magic softness rise, Steal o'er his form, and languish in his eyes; Melt in his voice, till Memory hints no more The woes unreal; but, with forfeit power, Resigns her empire o'er the yielding soul To sighs and tears she ceases to controul. Take heed that energy, sublimely strong, Imbibe the meteor-fires of gloomy Young; When, as scorn'd love paternal envy goads, Fierce Perseus invocates the dire abodes; To aid grim Vengeance, calls their demon hosts From the red confines of sulphureous coasts; Or, when fell Zanga's sable hand shall spread “Eternal curtains round Alonzo's bed.” Now, as the powers of later genius shine, And Jephson glows along his nervous line, Ne'er may unskilful acting cloud the rays, Inferior only to his Shakespear's blaze! Whether, with every anguish Love can feel, Braganza tremble at th' impending steel; Or the devoted Narbonne's passions lead, Headlong and fierce, to the accursed deed, While rolls the thunder, and the lightnings glare On the proud Filiacide's upstarting hair. In scenes like these, the just performer draws The fixed attention, and the mute applause; Yet most his powers enkindle rising fame From mighty Shakespear's orb of solar flame. But real grief, the scenic Proteus knows, Will blunt the mimic joys, the mimic woes. How hard to breathe, tho' loftiest themes inspire, The monarch's dignity, the warrior's fire; The phrenzied passion, in its dreariest glare, Love's tender grace, and Hope's energic air, When sharp Distress, the bane of studious Art, Sits, like a vulture, on the bleeding heart. Long 'twas my fate its ravenous tooth to feel, Yet, unrepining, every pang conceal; But, at the public smile, the bird of prey Spreads his dark wing, and swiftly flies away. With generous voice, and liberal hands, that know Warmly to praise, and nobly to bestow, My honour'd patrons, your protecting power, So kindly active in this anxious hour, Soft in my recent wounds pours oil and wine, And bids the health of peace once more be mine! PROLOGUE TO THE CIRCASSIAN, WRITTEN IN AUTUMN 1782. Slow from an ebon throne's majestic height, A beauteous form glides mournful on my sight, The floating purple, and the lofty mien, Proclaim the empress of the tragic scene; Divine Melpomene!—aggrieved she stands, Tears fast descending on her folded hands; The showery clouds thus dim the azure skies, Thus round the moon the misty halos rise. But soft!—the Muse of Anguish sighing speaks, Faint on my ear the murmuring accent breaks; Low hollow gales the plaintive sounds convey, And thus the mourner says,—or seems to say: “Can then the tender female bosom prove “A keener pang than disappointed love? “Ah me! for light Thalia more than shares “My darling Sheridan's devoted cares! “On her vain brows his lavish wreaths are thrown, “His thousand radiant gems emblaze her zone. “What tho' her bounty gave to his bright wand “O'er each gay grace of wit supreme command, “Yet, with sublimer force, my chemic fire “With proud distinction Parody of one of the lines in Mr Sheridzn's Monody on Garrick. deck'd his sacred lyre; “To purest gold its warbling wires I turn'd, “When their sweet lays o'er lifeless Garrick mourn'd. “And once he sung, in elevated strain, See his fine Epilogue to Semiramis. “My charms superior, and my right to reign; “When, with the majesty my impulse throws “In chasten'd splendour, on the poet's brows, “He bade the tears, that stream'd o'er Asia's Queen, “Flow soft in real Sorrow's lonely scene: “And, while they melt the heart, inspire its zeal “To sooth by pity, or by bounty heal. “Ah! soon he smiled those graceful tears away, “And for my frolic Rival wore the lay. “Yet let me hope the jocund pride of youth “Alone has warpt from me his love and truth; “That soon the rover may again be mine, “And with unfading laurels deck my shrine. “To-night an humbler hand the meed bestows, “And on my shrine the cypress garland throws. “O! may the fost'ring breath of public praise, “Preserve from cruel blight the votive sprays!” I hear no more—for, with a pensive smile, Slow glides the Muse down yonder winding isle. May you, ye brave, ye wise, ye good, ye fair, Fulfil, with suffrage kind, her fervent prayer! And since no force of wit, or comic art, Can shut to Sorrow's plaint the British heart, Hope whispers that your praise may bless the Bard, His first ambition, and his bright reward. PROLOGUE TO THE FORTUNATE DISAPPOINTMENT. A play written by Mrs Short, then of Newport, and represented by the pupils of her seminary. To teach our ductile youth the pleasing art, Whose powers persuasive steal into the heart, When graceful motion, and when accent just, Prove faithful ever to the writer's trust, No idle aim, no light design betrays, For virtue smiles on generous thirst of praise: And oft exterior elegance we find Give added influence to the noble mind! Since warmest glow the emulative fires, If, while our sense approves, our taste admires. But more important, more exalted views Prompt the kind efforts of our moral muse. Still (that the youthful maid each fault may scorn, Of cold reserve, or baser malice born) Bid fair Ingenuousness each thought reveal, To the mild guardians of her studied weal, Whom long experience has empower'd to know, When fleeting pleasures lead to lasting woe. Thus, while forewarn'd by them, ye shun the bowers Where serpents lurk beneath the gaudy flowers, Oft will their cares the passing hour employ To ope for you the springs of genuine joy; Point the safe track where Life's worst perils cease, The ways of pleasantness, the paths of peace. EPILOGUE TO THE FORRUNATE DISAPPOINTMENT. To-night the scene display'd what secret smart, What self-reproach must wound the virgin's heart, Rashly who dares from monitory eyes Veil her increasing passions, as they rise!— Ah thankless!—cold!—she has no middle choice, But long repentance, or enduring vice, Eliza's tears, or the detested guile Of artful Caroline's betraying smile; Fault leads to fault, till all the soul's defiled, And in base woman, ends the cunning child. Eliza, Eliza and Caroline, characters in the play. drooping, seems a blighted rose, That, while each sister-bud in beauty blows, Deep in its core the cankering worm receives, Whose sickly slime cements the yellowing leaves. Thus Disingenuousness, with chill controul, Contracts the worth, the gladness of the soul; Dims all the rays that light the artless eye, Pales the soft cheek, and prompts the secret sigh. But guilty Caroline we shuddering view, Like the fell spider, weave her treacherous clue. Emblem of hearts, where Envy's venom swells, That dark, sly, solitary reptile dwells; Bane to the heedless insect of the meads, That near the gleaming maze of viscous threads Waves the light wing, which now no more shall bear The entangled victim thro' the sunny air. Thus spirits mischievous, who ne'er can prove Joys, or of sisterly, or social love, Stung by their conscious worthlessness, prepare, For others' peace, the smooth insidious snare. O! be it ours to watch each thought betimes, Ere errors grow, by habit, into crimes! To think the counsels guardian friends impart Best shield from ill the inexperienced heart; Cherish each virtuous impulse, and improve To fairest flowers the seeds of duteous love! Flowers of the mind, ye fear no winter's rage, Grace our gay prime, adorn our fading age, If still, to strengthen their yet fragile stems, And in unfading colours tint their gems, A term in botany for the first buds of flowers. Enlivening Gratitude, and generous Truth, Shine the warm day-stars of our rising youth. COMPLAINT OF AN ARABIAN LOVER. ODE. Wide o'er the drowsy world, incumbent Night, Sullen and drear, his sable wing has spread! The waning moon, with interrupted light, Gleams cold and misty on my fever'd bed! Cold as she is, to her my bursting heart Shall pour its waste of woe, its unavailing smart. Thro' the long hours—ah me! how long the hours! My restless limbs no balmy languors know; Grieved tho' I am, yet grief's assuaging showers From burning eye-balls still refuse to flow; Love's jealous fires, A critical friend of the author's seemed to doubt whether a frown kindling fire was just metaphor; but, since it is poetically orthodox to say that the flame of love is lighted by the sunny ray of a smile, that of jealousy may certainly be said to enkindle from the lightning ofa frowning eye. There are lurid and dismal fires, as well as bright and cheerful ones. kindled by Aza's frown, Not the vast watery world, with all its waves can drown. Slow pass the stars along the night's dun plain! Still in their destined sphere serene they move; Nor does their mild effulgence shine in vain, Like the fierce blazes of neglected love: But this—this pang dissolves the galling chain! Aza, a broken heart defies thy fix'd disdain! BLINDNESS, A POEM. WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF AN ARTIST, WHO LOST HIS SIGHT BY THE GUTTA SERENA, IN HIS TWENTY-EIGHTH YEAR, AND WHO WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO CHANGE HIS PROFESSION FOR THAT OF MUSIC. Long for my circling years the Lord of Day Illumed creation with his glorious ray; And long of youth and health the rosy hours Saw liberal toil, with promissory powers, Preparing, against faded age, the peace Of modest competence, when strength might cease. Then,—as with cheerful hope my earnest sight Imbibed the blessings of the sacred light, Slow on that sight the mists preclusive stole; Dim and more dim the gathering shadows roll, Till, with the last thick drop, the visual boon Sunk into darkness 'mid the blaze of noon! How have I loved the changeful year to trace, Each laughing beauty, each terrific grace; To see warm Spring her vital influence pour, Green the bleak field, and gild the balmy shower; Tint the young foliage with her tenderest hue, And feed the opening flowers with richest dew! Charm'd did I see bright Summer climb the sky, Leave half the river's pebbly channel dry, On breathing meads the fragrant haycocks pile, Till the ripe Year's consummate glories smile:— View'd jocund Autumn rear her rival sheaves, With gold and purple tip the unfaded leaves; Crown amber morning with serenest noons, And night's dark zenith with protracted moons; Shake the rich fruit from every loaded bough, And with the wheaten wreath adorn her brow; Till colder gales the paled horizon roam, And stain and smear the gold-empurpled bloom, While sweeping fogs, conglobing as they pass, Bend with their silent drops the long coarse grass, And change, as on screen'd plat it timid blows, To livid hue the lone and lingering rose; Bare the rude thorns on all the russet hills, And crust with ice the borders of the rills;— Pensive I mark'd, when, with reverted eyes, Disorder'd garments and foreboding sighs, The last fair season left hill, dale, and plain, The yielded victims of the iron reign:— Saw Winter rove the dun and whistling heath, Swoln floods arresting with petrific breath, Send round the mountains all his winds to howl, Pale the slow morn, and bid the long night scowl; But ah! the glowing hearth, the neat repast, Derided oft the despot's power to blast, Since, if without his furious storms might pass, Boom thro' the vales, and rattle on the glass, Within was the gay talk, the flowing bowl, And Friendship's smile, that summer of the soul! Beloved vicissitudes! to me ye live Only on memory's record;—yet ye give The retrospective pleasure, ne'er to rise To the sad few, of ever-rayless eyes, Whose infant orbs, not opening on the light, From night maternal sprung to ceaseless night; Lost to their sense each charm kind Nature shews, That dawns and spreads, that varies and that glows. Then grateful let me prove, indulged to find Exemption from those pangs which rack the mind, Springing from foil'd solicitude to reach What Genius cannot paint, nor Wisdom teach; Pangs which the fruitless thirst to know inspires With ever-craving, never-fed desires! Comparing thus severer with severe, Arrested by my groan, exhaled my tear! Yet, yet Creation stands a blank to me, Her face now cover'd with a sable sea; Still am I doom'd thro' life's rough paths to stray, A long, deprived, and desolated way. But, to relieve inevitable woes, To my internal sight auspicious rose A beauteous pair:—Music, the nymph sublime, With stores increasing from the morn of Time; Such melodies as, slowly rising, stole On Saul's distracted sense with sweet controul, Till frantic Rage and fell Despair were flown, And Hope resumed her abdicated throne. Thus, Music, it was thine, by high behest, To charm and tranquillize the stormy breast, Ere harmony began her mazy rounds, Blending accordant with discordant sounds, Till thro' the ear the mingled currents roll, One sweet, one perfect, one revolving whole; Its charm with melody and verse combined, And bade thee, Music, reign o'er every mind. Rebellious only theirs, who breathe and move, Palsied to sympathy and dead to love; Dull as the rank, gross weeds, that feed and sleep, Where silent Lethe's opiate waters creep. Nymph of all climes by Nature, and thy code, By Art invented, thro' the wide abode Of civilized existence, power obtains Social to spread th' intelligible strains. While varying language, in each foreign clime, Is only known by study and by time, One are thy symbols, and where'er they come, At once perceived, escape the Bable doom. “Sphere-born,” thou com'st from black Despair to save, And sooth me fall'n into a living grave. Another comes, of mission more benign, In mortal semblance, tho' with soul divine! And whose the form the gentle Seraph wears, Scattering her roses o'er this vale of tears? Example bright to these degenerate times, Dark with the Ethiop stains of female crimes; She, whom no levity allures to stray Near e'en the confines of the faithless way; Who sooths the wretched and the hungry feeds, Heaven calls her Mercy, but Earth names her Leeds; This morning star, this fair, diffusive light, That sparkles by, and gilds my live-long night. VERSES, SENT WITH SOME ORNAMENTS FOR THE HAIR TO MISS MARGARET KNOWLES, ON HER RECOVERY FROM INOCULATION FOR THE SMALL POX, IN HER 17TH YEAR. WRITTEN IN THE SPRING. Nymph, for the giver's sake, thy tresses bind With these slight tokens of her wishes kind, Mix'd with her praise for having dared disarm The dread contagion of its power to harm, Furrow the cheeks, and blast their rising bloom, Or prove the loathsome escort to the tomb. Now, blithe as morning larks, thy steps shall stray, Fearless, tho' beauty's demon cross thy way. His fell effluvia, when it loads the gale, Thy rosy breath untainted may inhale, And waft thy pious gratitude to Heaven, Who with the bane, the antidote has given. END OF VOLUME FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. VERSES These verses were sent to the Gentleman's Magazine by Dr Darwin, a short time after they had been presented to him by their author, and sent without her knowledge, and with an alteration in the concluding lines; which alteration invokes the nymph of Botany to grace the scene. They are here inscribed as they were originally printed. Fourteen years after, in the spring 1792, the first part of that splendid poem, The Botanic Garden, appeared, which had been some years oddly preceded by the second part of the work. In that first part its author has placed the above verses as the exordium of his poem, with some slight verbal alterations, and with a few brilliant lines of his own interwoven. There is no hint in the notes, or even by a quotation mark, that this poetic landscape was the work of another pen. The circum- stance would have been immaterial, if the lines had not ap- peared in print with the name of their author; but that cir- cumstance rendered that claim necessary. Other periodical publications of that day copied them from the Gentleman's Magazine. WRITTEN IN DR DARWIN'S BOTANIC GARDEN Near Lichfield, July, 1778. O come not here, ye proud, whose breasts enfold Th' insatiate wish of glory, or of gold! O come not here, whose branded foreheads wear The eternal frown of envy or of care! For you no Dryad decks her fragrant bowers, For you her sparkling urn no Naiad pours; Unmask'd by you, light Graces skim the green, And hovering Cupids aim their shafts unseen. But thou, whose mind the well-attemper'd ray Of taste and virtue lights with purer day; Whose finer sense each soft vibration owns, Mute and unfeeling to discordant tones; Like the fair flower, that spreads its lucid form To meet the sun, but shuts it to the storm; For thee my borders name the glowing wreath, My fountains murmur and my zephyrs breathe; To charm thine eye, amid the crystal tide, With sinuous track, my silvery nations glide; My choral birds their vivid plumes unfold, And insect armies wave their wings of gold. And if with thee some gentle maid should stray, Disastrous Love companion of her way, O! lead her timid step to yonder glade, Whose arching rock incumbent alders shade! These, as meek evening wakes the temperate breeze, And moon-beams glimmer thro' the trembling trees, The rills that gurgle round shall sooth her ear, The weeping rock shall number tear for tear; In a gloomy recess of this dell, there is a rock that drops about once in every minute, alike in dry and wet seasons. And as sad Philomel, alike forlorn, Sings to the night, reclining on a thorn, While at mute intervals each falling note Sighs in the gale, and whispers round the grot, The sister-woes shall calm her throbbing breast, And softest slumbers steal her cares to rest. Thus spoke the Genius, as he stept along, Dr Darwin is here considered as the genius of the place, since he first cultivated and adorned the tangled and swampy plain. And bade these lawns to Peace and Truth belong; Down the steep slopes he led, with modest skill, The willing path-way, and the vagrant rill; Stretch'd o'er the marshy vale the willowy mound, Where shines the lake amid the cultur'd ground; Rear'd the young woodland, smooth'd the wavy green, And gave to Beauty all the quiet scene. O! may no ruder step the bowers prophane, No midnight wassaler deface the plain! And when the tempests of the wintry day Blow golden autumn's varied leaves away, Winds of the North, restrain your icy gales, Nor chill the bosom of these Happy Vales! The Author claimed these verses in Dr Darwin's life- time. Two years before he died, they appeared in her name, in Shaw's History of Staffordshire. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF MR JOSEPH SYKES, OF WEST-ELLA, AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN. Bleak winds no longer lowl around the hill, Nor wildly eddy through the shrinking vale; No more the grey frost creeps upon the rill, But kind Favonius breathes the soften'd gale. And morn arising, from her vermil wing, 'Mid the coy dell, and on the liberal plain, Showers each luxuriant blessing of the spring, Her crystal sun-beam, and her balmy rain. I hail thee, Spring! but my sad eyes o'erflow, No joy of mine thy soft revival greets; Yet still, for purposes of tender woe, Give me to cull thy choicest bosom'd sweets. Pure lilies, screen'd by your unfolding leaves, Violets, that breathe your incense on the morn, Each flower, that from the dewy light receives Its orient hues, my votive wreath adorn! And o'er the dear Amintor's early tomb, Where Friendship pours her tributary tear, Strewn by the rivals of his youthful bloom, And O! congenial garland, languish there! Fade, blossoms, fade! for so each kindred grace In young Amintor faded in its prime, When dire disease approach'd with stealing pace, To antedate the withering power of Time. Retir'd, like you, no gaudy vain parade Glanc'd o'er his talents one obtrusive ray; He woo'd chaste Science in the rural shade, And won, but shunn'd to lead her into day. Warm, though unboasted, that ingenuous heart, Whose every thought was tender, brave, and free, While all the treasures Knowledge could impart, Dear soaring Spirit, she prepar'd for thee. Light of thy parents' eyes!—but now no more On thy soul's treasures shall they proudly gaze; Treasures, outweighing far the boasted store Of many, counting twice thy lapse of days. Still must the dim eyes of bereaved love Strain on each bright memorial through their tears: Ah! how the sick'ning Fancy loves to rove O'er blasted promises of happy years! And as the essence of a serpent proves Potent the venom from its bite to throw, So thus to feed on perish'd hopes, removes The mortal influence from their sting of woe. Yes, in the cause that made our grief extreme, We see our bane and antidote appear, Sooth'd to remember Hope's delightful beam, Though now extinguish'd on the early bier. We feel how oft illusive shines that ray When clearest it allures our flatter'd sight, Shews all the paths of life so bright and gay, That rise magnetic in its dubious light. There winds gay Pleasure's track, with roses strewn, But now we feel that ne'er untorn'd they glow; On Learning's bays that Envy's blight is thrown, That stain'd with blood the warrior-laurels blow. Yet Prudence may extract each wounding thorn, Fame, strength'ning as sherises, screen from blight; And chance avert from Valour's radiant morn The sanguine clouds, that threaten timeless night. They may,—but who, ah! who can say they shall? Does no just dread Hope's fairy dreams annoy? E'en realis'd, yet Wisdom's tear will fall O'er triumph vain for unenduring joy. Short since we know the most protracted span Of pale Longevity's soon number'd years;— But Hope, contemplating the stinted plan, Throws it in perspective, and calms our fears. Now, ere their time, our fairy visions fade, Relentless Death has quench'd Hope's silver ray! But O! what form irradiates wide the shade? What beauteous Daughter of eternal day? See, she pervades the dense, and mournful gloom! With radiant smile the vault funereal cheers! I know thee, Faith, thou only canst illume The night of sorrow, and the vale of tears. While warm devotion lifts thy starry eyes, O'er Death's drear cell thy sacred torch shall wave, And see! the late extinguish'd fires arise, In brighter lustre, from the opening grave! Ah! brighter did I say? the Solar Light, When from the East his summer's glory pours, Not more transcends the waning orb of night, Than heavenly hopes, the hopes of mortal hours. Immortal Hope on endless pleasure bends On transport unallay'd her quenchless beam, Shews their pure fountain free from all that blends Danger and pain with joy's terrestrial stream. Beyond life's treacherous rocks and stormy wave, Reveals the boundless bliss, for us in store, When past the darksome confines of the grave, We meet our Angel Friend to part no more. To part no more!—blest Falth, the sounds are thine! And at those sounds each fond regret will cease, Parental Love no longer shall repine, But all its rebel sighs be hush'd to peace. Now rise the hopes that only thou canst bring, Supreme from each repining woe to save; Resistless Death, O! where is now thy sting? O! where thy victory, insatiate Grave? CHARITY, PRIZE POEM AT BATH-EASTON: Containing a Paraphrase of the 13th Chap. of Corinthians. What awful light invests the day? Not less unlike proud summer's ray Than pallid gleams of cold December's noon. The myrtles glow with liveliest green, The mystic vase seems plainer seen, Though all ungilded by the lavish sun. With clear, yet sober beauty shine The verdant bower, the classic shrine, As when, in calmest hour of silent night, In soft perspective rise the vales, The silvered lawns, the shadowy dales, Beneath the full-orb'd moon's unclouded light. Behold a beauteous form appears, Inhabitant of happier spheres, Whose charms divine all human charms transcend! Does then, to grace this Delphic grove, Bright Clio leave the courts above, And, glorying in its tuneful powers, descend? Ah, no! for o'er the placid shrine Nor solar emanations shine, Nor lyres Aonian pour the liquid strain; The tender limbs, the angel face Have female, but celestial grace, And yet no Nymph she seems of Phœbus' train. In that mild eye's translucent ray No frolic pleasures idly play, Nor raptur'd fancy lifts their sacred ball; No purple robe redundant flows, No gemm'd tiara brightly glows; All snowy white the decent garments fall. And to her veil'd and spotless breast A sacred book is fervent press'd, With red drops stain'd the hallow'd leaves appear; Now gently o'er the shrine she bends, Her arm, with modest grace, extends, And silver sweet the accents meet our ear. “Attend, ye Fair,—ye Learn'd,—ye Gay; “To peace I point the certain way, “To all the happiness your state may claim; “Ne'er shall ye find its sweet, coy stores “On Luxury's voluptuous shores, “Nor rise they on th' Icarian wings of fame. “That to be blest is to be good, “These leaves proclaim, with martyr-blood “Seal'd is their truth—and awful when they sung “Me Charity, by power divine, “First Priestess of the Christian shrine, “The vault of Heaven with seraph-pæans rung. “Once more my power, my mission learn, “And know;—could ye events discern, “As yet dim embryos in the womb of time; “Though ye were grac'd with every art “That Wisdom, Science, Wit, impart, “Though Faith were your's unswerving and sublime; “For virtuous purpose, though ye pour The institution of Bath-Easton was a charitable one. “The votive strain beneath this bower, “Where blest Benevolence the garland weaves; “If not for me ye wake the string, “With tongues of angels though ye sing, “No ear divine the tinkling sound perceives: “And though ye smooth the thorny bed, “Where Sickness leans her languid head, “And pining Want, with fainting step, retires; “Though e'en to the devouring flames “Ye patient yield your mortal frames “When superstition lights demoniac pyres; “If in the proud and rigid breast “My soft, my generous behest “Each seeming-virtuous action fails to inspire, “Then are they fruitless in the eye “That lights the earth, and glads the sky, “Of Wisdom,Truth,and Love,th'Almighty Sire. “He bade me bend the stubborn mind “To all that's patient, soft, and kind, “Suspicion pale, and red-ey'd anger chace; “The vaunt of Pride, and Envy's stings; “Th' envenom'd dart that Slander flings, “Cruel Assassin of the Human Race! “When prophecies are heard no more, “When vanish'd Wisdom's priceless lore, “And cold, and silent every mortal tongure, “These blest unerring leaves ordain “That I shall range yon azure plain, “Immortal as the source from whence I sprung. “And when, amid the falling spheres, “With me unswerving Faith appears, “And Hope triumphant rises o'er the storm, “Great as they are, yet more sublime “The Omnific Voice will hail me prime, “Who his benign commands did best on earth perform. She spake—she smil'd!—The Vision, heavenly bright, Melted in purest rays of liquid light. Lady Miller, patrouess of that poetic institution, at her villa, near Bath, always appointed the subject of the verses written for the festival. A description of its ceremonies will be found prefixed to the Author's Monoday on Lady Miller. MONODY ON THE DEATH OF DAVID GARRICK, ESQ. Prize Poem at Bath-Easton. Dim sweeps the shower along the misty vale, And Grief's low accents murmur in the gale. O'er the damp vase, Horatio, sighing, leans, And gazes absent on the faded scenes. Soft melancholy shades each sprightly grace, That wont to revel o'er his Laura's face, When, with sweet smiles, the garlands gayshe twin'd, And each light spray her roseate ribbons bind. Dropt from her hand the scattered myrtles lie; And lo! dark cypress meets the earnest eye! For lifeless Garrick sighs from Genius breathe, And weeping Beauty culls the funeral wreath. Great Shakespear's spirit, with its solar rays, Led him through all the wide, theatric maze; Through the deep pathos of its mournful themes, Through the light magic of its playful dreams. He caught the genuine humour, glowing there, Wit's vivid flash, and Cunning's sober leer. The strange distress, that fires the kindling brain, When roams the heart-rent Sire the stormy plain; Lear. When dire Ambition, from the regal room Macbeth. In silence, night, and horror's breathless gloom, Conscience-appal'd, his crimson hands surveys, And turns to fancied sounds the wide reverted gaze; Or when the pale Youth, in the midnight shade, Hamlet. Pursues the steel-clad phantom through the glade; Or, starting from his couch, with wild affright When the crown'd Murderer glares upon our sight, Richard the Third. And all his senses fly the dire controul Of guilt-struck terror, rushing on his soul,— Our subject passions own'd the sway compleat, And hail'd their Garrick, as their Shakespear, great. That voice, which pour'd its music on the ear, Sweet as the songsters of the vernal year; Those graceful gestures, and that eye of fire, With rage that flam'd, or languish'd with desire; Awak'd the jocund mirth in dimples sleek, Or made the chilling blood forsake the cheek, Where are they now?—Dark, in the narrow cell, Insensate,—shrunk,—and wan,—and cold, they dwell; A silence, solemn, and eternal keep, Where neither love shall smile, nor anguish weep. Breathe, Genius, still the tributary sigh! Still gush, ye liquid pearls, from Beauty's eye! With slackened strings suspend your harps, ye Nine, While round his urn yon cypress wreath ye twine; Then give his talents to your loudest fame, And grave on your high shrines, Garrick's unrivall'd name. ODE ON THE PYTHAGOREAN SYSTEM. Prize Poem at Bath-Easton. Spirit of man, if thy mysterious fires Are emanent from that Eternal Light, In whose comparison the Sun retires, Eclips'd and pale, can System trace thy flight, When thou shalt seek, freed from corporeal load, In dim Futurity a new abode? Ah no! strange destinies her dreams prepare For thy undying sense of joys and pains; How ill the Samian Sage explains Samian Sage.—Pythagoras. Thy trackless wanderings in yon fields of air! Inadequate the bonds, by which he tries To chain thee still to earth, when lost, by guilt, the skies. And yet, howe'er imperfect, wild, and strange, His tenets seem; still, as they not discard A sacred sense, along their erring range, Of punish'd crime, and virtue's fair reward, They soar, though on weak wings, above the sphere Where broods mad Atheism o'er precepts drear; Or, with incessant sneer, delights to lead, By cold Oblivion's deep and sable waves, His grovelling crew of sensual slaves, Inebriate, muttering Epicurus' creed, And impious quenching in the sullen stream The brightning torch of Hope, kindled at Truth's pure beam. Our more enlighten'd Sage disdained to fold In blank Annihilation's icy shroud, The Spirit warm, that, from her earthly hold, Had wings to soar above yon azure cloud; Yet has he much perplex'd her doubtful way To Guilt's dark shores, and Virtue's realms of day. But tune thy notes, my lyre, to gayer strains; Admit the futile system for an hour; Embrace its creed, invoke its power, And to its fond illusions give the reins; Conceive the soaring mind has earthly bounds, And vegetates, or breathes, through Fate's eternal rounds. Then while Revenge meets his congenial lot, And howls the tiger of the desert plain; While sensual Love burns in the odious Goat, And in the Hog the Glutton feasts again; While selfish Dulness indolently laves, A cold Torpedo in the stagnant waves; While Avarice grovels in the sateless Worm, And baneful Envy, on the Hornet's wing, Rises, and darts the barbed sting; While Vanity assumes a kindred form, Sports a gay Butterfly in summer's noon, And shewsher gilded wings, quick glancing to the Sun; Me, whom nor rage, nor thirst of proud controul, Nor wish impure, inflames to deeds abhorr'd; Nor costly viand, nor inebriate bowl Allures to revel at the Glutton's board; I, who can weep for sorrows not my own, Nor covet gold, nor envy bright renown; If, for impetuous errors, ill-restrain'd, For many a frail omission, frequent mourn'd, For talents wasted, prudence scorn'd, My struggling spirit must to earth be chain'd, Ah! gentle be its expiatory doom, In Brute-Existence dumb, or vegetable gloom! If sink it must, O grant, ye lenient Powers, Soft that it fall on Laura's Delphic shrine; Then rise a myrtle in her blooming bowers, Whose verdant arms may round her altars twine! There, as the tuneful train, the groves among, Pour the full cadence of the dulcet song, While yet around me trill the charming strains, While gentle Laura bends my glossy spray, And graceful weaves its garlands gay, My ardent spirit scarce shall feel its chains; Scarce shall its silent destiny deplore, Since yet I form the wreaths, which once with pride I wore. INVOCATION OF THE COMIC MUSE. Prize Poem at Bath-Easton. Onthis mirth-devoted day, From these festal bowers away, In your sable vestments flee, Train of sad Melpomene! Ye, who midnight horrors dart Through the palpitating heart; Fear, that flies its shadowy cause, With hurried step and startled pause; Straw-crown'd Phrenzy's glaring gaze, Chaunting shrill her changing lays: Nor let dim-ey'd Grief appear, Weaving mournful garlands here, Cypress-buds, and fading flowers, Wet with cold November's showers; Nor with the damp, wan brow, and streaming wound, Let stern, self-pierc'd Despair her hollow groans resound. Thalia come, fantastic Fair, Enthron'd in pantomimic car! Thine open brow with roses bind, By morning's lucid rays entwin'd; Thine azure vest flow lightly down, And vivid glow thy rainbow zone! Haste thee, Nymph, with sunny hair, With varied voice, and jocund air, Adorn'd with all the laughing grace, That decks the sweet betwitching face Of her, who o'er the knee of snow Archly snaps young Cupid's bow; Alluding to a celebrated picture of Mrs Kauffman's, The Nymphs disarming Cupid. For O! in that more beauteous maid Than Grecian pencil e'er display'd, Bright from Angelica's unrival'd hand, Goddess, thy portrait glows, and charms the gazing Land. Nor let this Delphic Vase alone Thy all-enlivening influence own; Exert then still thy magic power To whiten every passing hour For him, whose taste decided shines In the fair Priestess of these shrines; For her, who guides the devious feet Of Genius to this fair retreat, Her verdant prize extending there;— Ah still for them, the generous Pair, Collect thou each idea bright From Fancy's shrine of missive light; From Health, from Love, from Virtue's ray, To gild through life their varied day, Illume the night, and bless the rising morn, And with the beams of bliss the golden sun adorn. AMUSEMENTS OF WINTER. Written in 1779. Now, in the tempests of the wintry sky, The whirling leaves of sickly Autumn fly; But blithe Euphrosyne will soon appear, And gild the horrors of the darkening year. Soon shall she hail, with buskin'd Dian's horn, The light, ambiguous, of the tardy morn; Mark the fierce Courser, the gay Youth beneath, Neigh as he paws the earth, and ardent breathe; Toss the light mane, and snuff the moisten'd gale, Till vocal throats proclaim the tainted dale. Then the fleet hoof the echoing forest shakes, Then dash the deep-mouth'd hounds among the brakes; The high, rough hill the hunter-throng deride, Strain up its steep, and thunder down its side; Sweep through the misty vale, in long array, And shout exulting o'er the treacherous prey. Hygeia's eyes, whence diamond lustre streams, Deck the pale Orient with their glad'ning beams. She can the short and louring day illume, And, with her dimpled Sister, mock the gloom. Twins and companions ever on the earth, Are the bright Goddesses of Health and Mirth. Now fall the fearful Night's incumbent shades, And the swoln river pours along the glades; Wild as the gulphing waves their eddies form, Shrieks the remorseless spirit of the storm. But, for the Social, shines the clean, warm hearth, And all within the walls is love and mirth. Pleas'd with the absence of intrusive Day, Science and Wit their varied stores display; And the heart feels, whate'er our Bards may sing, Bright winter-fires propitious as the spring; Since most the Youth the timid Virgin fires, When he, and only he, her breast inspires; No golden suns, no fragrant flowers, to share The charm'd attention of the list'ning Fair. And when the howling wind and beating rain Shake the firm roof, and plough the delug'd plain, The sweet affections, in those fearful hours, Rule the kind bosom with augmented powers; Then most the Sense, and Soul, dependence feel On Love's gay smile, and Friendship's cordial zeal. In splendid roofs, the brilliant chandelier Pours trembling lustre on the full-plum'd Fair, And to their rival eyes the scenes unfold That glitter azure, and that glitter gold. Here fickle Fortune leads her motley throng, Where varied laws to varied states belong: Solemn Spadille, the Lewis of the Train, Rules with despotic sway the velvet plain; Whist's graver tribes Republic schemes display, Her still chang'd rulers bearing sober sway; While Pam, like Prussian Frederic, darts to view, Exulting o'er the vanquish'd troops of Loo. All these, and more, with deeds of proud acclaim, Flock to the standard of the giddy Dame. His vassal monarchs thus Atrides bore From Grecian cities to the Trojan shore. Hark the soft flutes, and loud'ning hautboys sound, And youthful Beauty glides her graceful round; Till brisker measures rapid urge along The light, the mutable, the bounding throng. When graver pleasures their pursuits engage, Majestic Tragedy sublimes the stage, Till her gay Sister puts the pomp to flight, And Mirth resumes her empire o'er the night. Now rapt Cecilia strikes the golden lyre, Wakes to wild rage, or melts in soft desire; And to her vocal tubes, and marshall'd strings, A thousand blended harmonies she brings. Their leader, Melody, they still sustain, And with sonorous grandeur lift the strain. Then from the full Orchestra loud resounds The volant fugue, with its successive sounds. Heard, and but heard, lo! now the soften'd notes Invite the song, that round the area floats, When graceful Harrop pours the liquid lay, Sweet as the warbler on the moonlight spray. Her fine expression, her consummate art Lift the moist eye, and thrill the feeling heart; Strike e'en the prating fools of fashion dumb, Till late all voice, they now all ear become. 'Twas thus that, listening to the Syren's strain, Charm'd Scylla hush'd her barkers on the main. These are thy Syrens, Winter,—while they sing, In vain the wild winds whirl on darken'd wing. Divine Euphrosyne, they form thy train, For absent thou, e'en they would sing in vain; But from the radiance of thy laughing eye, The fiends of wintry Nature coward hie To howling heaths—damp fens—and murky caves, Uprooted forests, and o'er-whelming waves. As low-hung skies dismiss their dusky steam, Before the rising Sun's pervading beam, So fly November's monsters o'er the lea, And leave the world to Music—Love—and Thee. BERMUDA, ADDRESSED TO DOCTOR TUCKER, A young Physician, Native of that Island. While springs from thy thrill'd heart the patriottear, Thine, generous Youth, my sympathy sincere; Beneath our transient suns and wayward skies, As bend regretful thy reverted eyes Far o'er the mighty Ocean of the West, Where thy lov'd Island lifts her palmy breast, And shoreless solitudes around her reign, Gem of the vast, and melancholy main! Oft, in my fancy, I behold thee trace Each mild exemption, and each glowing grace, That bless thy native region, as she laves Her massy pillars These are very tall rocks around Bermuda. in the lonely waves, That ceaseless rave, See Shakspeare's Tempest, where Ariel alludes to the high surf around this island. “Thou call'st me at midnight, to fetch dews “From the still vex'd Bermuda.” and dash her rocky shore, But to innoxious winds all idly roar; Like peevish babes that from the mother's breast Fling the wild head and scorn the offer'd rest, Yet, in their impotence of childish rage, Excite not anger stern, nor sad presage. So fair Bermuda, with maternal smile, Derides the furious seas that lash her Isle, Since her bright Year, in youth eternal crown'd, With flowers perennial decks the glowing ground; Protrudes successive germs from every root, And shews, on the same bough, the blossom and the fruit. Whate'er with liberal hand rich Autumn throws, Dreads nor the Winter's wind, nor chilling snows. She to fresh Spring resigns her ripen'd pride, And green young leaves the juicy treasure hide. The sweet Bermuda, Nature's strife unknown, Reclines at ease on her cerulean throne; Feels no swart Sirius o'er her shining day Breathe the sick gale, or dart the livid ray, But calls the punctual breeze, The sea breezes at Bermuda come on about noon, and last till day-dawn. to fan the hours, That dance incessant 'mid her lemon bowers; To sigh through yellow groves of luscious canes, Or sweet palmettos, branching o'er the plains; Gently, with fragrant breath, at eve to blow, And cool the perfum'd night till morn shall glow; Hears birds, of every hue, with lavish throat Pour from each shade the wild, voluptuous note, Sees Plenty bear an unexhausted horn, And roseate Beauty deck the bursting morn. For there no twilight veils In those latitudes the sun shines out instantaneously on the break of dawn. the dewy rays, But o'er the dusk immediate glcries blaze, While lofty cedars rise to meet the beams, Whose fluid gold o'er the dark foliage streams, Back as they throw the sable shroud of night, And give the gorgeous scene to glow in light; Sees no dim cloud o'ershade her noon-tide bowers, Or wet her purple eve with chilling showers; But silent dews the closing florets feed, Swell the young grain, and saturate the mead While amber odours cheer the bloomy vale, And Health's clear spirit blends with every gale. Well may thy mind, dear Youth, incessant rove To those luxuriant scenes of peace, and love; Where on thy early life, energic, rose The hope that stimulates, the bliss that glows; Each good fraternal friendship can impart, Or parent fondness pour upon the heart. Yet, if resistless Destiny ordains Thy future years to our less favour'd plains, Amid the thicken'd sky, the howling storm, O! may no mental blast thy peace deform! May Science bless with richest stores thy youth, And Wisdom guide thee to the shrine of Truth! O'er fond Regret, Hope, Love, and Joy prevail, Warm as Bermuda's Sun, and gentle as her Gale! ELEGY ON CAPTAIN COOK. Sorrowing, the Nine beneath yon blasted yew Shed the soft drops of pity's holy dew; Mute are their tuneful tongues, extinct their fires; Yet not in silence sleep their silver lyres; To the bleak gale they vibrate sad and slow, In deep accordance to a Nation's woe. Ye, who ere-while for Cook's illustrious brow Pluck'd the green laurel, and the oaken bough, Hung the gay garlands on the trophied oars, And pour'd his fame along a thousand shores, Strike the slow death-bell!—weave the sacred verse, And strew the cypress o'er his honour'd hearse; In sad procession wander round the shrine, And weep him mortal, whom ye sung divine! Say first, what Power inspir'd his dauntless breast With scorn of danger and inglorious rest, To quit imperial London's gorgeous domes, Where, deck'd in thousand tints, young Pleasure roams; In cups of summer-ice her nectar pours, Or twines, 'mid wint'ry snows, her roseate bowers; Where the warm Orient loads Britannia's gales With all the incense of Sabæan vales; Where soft Italia's silken sons prolong The lavish cadence of the artful song; Where Beauty moves with fascinating grace, Calls the sweet blush to wanton o'er her face, On each fond youth her soft artillery tries, Aims the light smile, and rolls the frolic eyes: What Power inspir'd his dauntless breast to brave The scorch'd Equator, and th' Antarctic wave? Climes, where fierce Suns in cloudless ardors shine, And pour the dazzling deluge round the Line; The realms of frost, where icy mountains rise, 'Mid the pale summer of the polar skies?— It was Benevolence!—on coasts unknown, The shiv'ring natives of the frozen zone, And the swart Indian, as he faintly strays “Where Cancer reddens in the solar blaze,” She bade him seek;—on each inclement shore Plant the rich seeds of her exhaustless store; Unite the savage hearts, and hostile hands, In the firm compact of her gentle bands; Strew her soft comforts o'er the barren plain, Sing her sweet lays, and consecrate her fane. While half the warring world, in senseless strife, Dire thirst of power, and lavish waste of life, Sent their hoarse thunders o'er the seas to roar, And dye the distant waves in human gore, O fair Benevolence! thy guiding ray With light so pure illum'd the wat'ry way, Amaz'd and charm'd the Sons of Ravage stood, And by its lustre, streaming o'er the flood, Mark'd thy mild Hero's rising ships afar, And hush'd to peace the brazen throat of War; His sacred ensigns view'd with moisten'd eye, And struck the blood-stain'd flag, and sail'd admiring by! When high in rage the troubled deep they plough'd, Thus to thy charms War's haughty chieftains bow'd, Lovely Benevolence!—O Nymph divine! I see thy light step print the burning Line! Thy lucid eye the dubious pilot guides, The faint oar struggling with the scalding tides.— On as thou lead'st the bold, the glorious prow, Mild, and more mild, the sloping sun-beams glow; Now weak and pale the lessen'd lustres play, As round th' horizon rolls the timid day; Barb'd with the sleeted snow, the driving hail, Rush the fierce arrows of the polar gale; And through the dim, unvaried, ling'ring hours, Wide o'er the waves incumbent Horror low'rs. From the rude summit of yon frozen steep, Contrasting Glory gilds the dreary deep! Lo!—deck'd with vermil youth and beamy grace, Hope in her step, and gladness in her face, Light on the icy rock, with outstretch'd hands, The Goddess of the new Columbus stands. Round her bright head the plumy peterels soar, The Peterel is a bird found in the frozen seas; its neck and tail are white, and its wings of a bright blue. Blue as her robe, that sweeps the frozen shore; Glows her soft cheek, as vernal mornings fair, And warm as summer-suns her golden hair; O'er the hoar waste her radiant glances stream, And courage kindles in their magic beam. She points the ship its mazy path, to thread The floating fragments “In the course of the last 24 hours, we passed through several fields of broken ice; they were in gencral narrow, but of considerable extent. In one part the pieces of ice were so close, that the ship had much difficulty to thread them.” of the frozen bed. While o'er the deep, in many a dreadful form, The giant Danger howls along the storm, Furling the iron sails “Our sails and rigging were so frozen, that they seemed plates of iron.”with numbed hands, Firm on the deck the great Adventurer stands; Round glitt'ring mountains hears the billows rave, And the vast ruin The breaking of one of these immense mountains of ice, and the prodigious noise it made, is particularly described in Cook's second voyage to the South Pole.thunder on the wave.— Appal'd he hears!—but checks the rising sigh, And turns on his firm band a glist'ning eye.— Not for himself the sighs unbidden break, Amid the terrors of the icy wreck; Not for himself starts the impassion'd tear, Congealing as it falls;—nor pain, nor fear, Nor Death's dread darts, impede the great design, Till Nature “After running four leagues this course, with the ice on our starboard side, we found ourselves quite embayed, the ice extending from north-north-east, round by the west and south, to east, in one compact body; the weather was tolerably clear, yet we could see no end to it.” draws the circumscribing line. Huge rocks of ice th' arrested ship embay, And bar the gallant Wanderer's dangerous way.— His eye regretful marks the Goddess turn The assiduous prow from its relentless bourn. And now antarctic Zealand's drear domain Frowns, and o'erhangs th' inhospitable main. On its chill beach this dove of human-kind For his long-wand'ring foot short rest shall find, Bear to the coast the olive-branch “To carry a green branch in the hand on landing, is a pacific signal, universally understood by all the islanders in the South Seas.” in vain, And quit on wearied wing the hostile plain.— With jealous low'r the frowning natives view The stately vessel, and adventurous crew; Nor fear the brave, nor emulate the good, But scowl with savage thirst of human blood! And yet there were, who in this iron clime Soar'd o'er the herd on Virtue's wing sublime; Rever'd the stranger-guest, and smiling strove To sooth his stay with hospitable love; Fann'd in full confidence the friendly flame, Join'd plighted hands, and name exchang'd The exchange of names is a pledge of amity among these islanders, and was frequently proposed by them to Captain Cook and his people; so also is the joining noses. for name. To these the Hero leads his living store, And pours new wonders on th' uncultur'd shore Captain Cook left various kinds of animals upon this coast, together with garden-seeds, &amp;c. The Zealanders had hitherto subsisted upon fish, and such coarse vegetables as their climate produced; and this want of better provision, it is supposed, induced them to the horrid practice of eating human flesh. The silky fleece, fair fruit, and golden grain; And future herds and harvests bless the plain. O'er the green soil the kids exulting play, And sounds his clarion loud the bird of day; The downy goose her ruffled bosom laves, Trims her white wing, and wantons in the waves; Stern moves the bull along th' affrighted shores, And countless nations tremble as he roars. So when the Daughter of eternal Jove, And Ocean's God, to bless their Athens strove, The massy trident with gigantic force Cleaves the firm earth—and lo! the stately horse; He paws the ground, impatient of the rein, Shakes his high front, and thunders o'er the plain. Then Wisdom's Goddess plants the embryon seed, And bids new foliage shade the sultry mead; 'Mid the pale green the tawny olive shine, And famish'd thousands bless the hand divine. Now the warm solstice o'er the shining bay, Darts from the north its mild meridian ray; Again the Chief invokes the rising gale, And spreads again in desert seas the sail; O'er dangerous shoals his steady steerage keeps, O'er walls of coral, The coral rocks are described as rising perpendicularly from the greatest depths of the ocean, insomuch that the sounding-line could not reach their bottom; and yet they were but just covered with water. These rocks are now found to be fabricated by sea-insects. ambush'd in the deeps; Strong Labour's hands the crackling cordage twine, And sleepless Patience “We had now passed several months with a man constantly in the chains heaving the lead.” heaves the guardian line. Borne on fierce eddies black Tornado springs, Dashing the gulphy main with ebon wings; In the vex'd foam his sweeping trail he shrouds, And rears his serpent-crest amid the clouds; Wrapp'd in dark mists with hideous bellowing roars, Drives all his tempests on, and shakes the shores. Already has the groaning ship resign'd Half her proud glories to the furious wind. The fear-struck mariner beholds from far, In gathering rage, the elemental war; As rolls the rising vortex, stands aghast, Folds the rent sail, or clasps the shivering mast! Onward, like Night, the frowning Demon comes, Show'rs a dread deluge from his shaken plumes; Fierce as he moves the gulphed sand uptears, And high in air the shatter'd canvass bears. Hardly the heroes in that fateful hour Save the torn navy from his whelming power; But soon from Industry's restoring hand, New masts aspire, and snowy sails expand. On a lone beach a rock-built temple “On one part of this isle there was a solitary rock, rising on the coast with arched cavities, like a majestic temple.” stands, Stupendous pile! unwrought by mortal hands; Sublime the ponderous turrets rise in air, And the wide roof basaltic columns bear; Through the long aisles the murm'ring tempestsblow, And Ocean chides his dashing waves below. From this fair fane, along the silver sands, Two sister-virgins wave their snowy hands; First gentle Flora Flora is the Goddess of modern Botany, and Fauna of modern Zoology: hence the pupils of Linnæus call their books Flora Anglica—Fauna Danica, &amp;c. “The Flora of one of these islands contained 30 new plants.”—round her smiling brow Leaves of new forms, and flow'rs uncultur'd glow; Thin folds of vegetable silk, In New Zealand is a flag of which the natives make their nets and cordage. The fibres of this vegetable are longer and stronger than our hemp and flax; and some, manufactured in London, is as white and glossy as fine silk.

It is perpetually jumping along on its hind legs, its fore legs being too short to be used in the manner of other quadrupeds. bounding by her side; Around the Nymph her beauteous Pois “The Poi-bird, common in those countries, has feathers of a fine mazarine blue, except those of the neck, which are of a beautiful silver grey; and two or three short white ones, which are in the pinion-joint of the wing. Under its throat hang two little tufts of curled white feathers, called its poies, which, being the Otaheitean word for ear-rings, occasioned our giving that name to the bird; which is not more remarkable for the beauty of its plumage, than for the exquisite melody of its note.” display Their varied plumes, and trill the dulcet lay; A Giant-bat, The bats which captain Cook saw in some of these countries were of incredible dimensions, measuring three feet and a half in breadth, when their wings were extended. with leathern wings outspread, Umbrella light, hangs quiv'ring o'er her head.

With earnest gaze the still enamour'd crew Mark the fair forms; and as they pass, pursue; But round the steepy rocks, and dangerous strand, Rolls the white surf, “As we passed this island, many of its trees had an unusual appearance, and the richness of the vegetation much invited our naturalists to land, but their earnest wishes were in vain, from the dangerous reefs and the violence of the surfs.” and shipwreck guards the land.

Now leads Benevolence the destin'd way, Where all the Loves in Otaheite stray. To bid the Arts disclose their wond'rous pow'rs, To bid the Virtues consecrate the bow'rs, She gives her Hero to its blooming plain:— Nor has he wander'd, has he bled in vain! His lips persuasive charm th' uncultur'd youth, Teach Wisdom's lore, and point the path of Truth. See! chasten'd love Captain Cook observes, in his second voyage, that the women of Otaheite were grown more modest, and that the barbarous practice of destroying their children was lessened. in softer glances flows, See! with new fires parental duty glows. Thou smiling Eden of the southern wave, Could not, alas! thy grateful wishes save That angel-goodness, which had blest thy plain?— Ah! vain thy gratitude, thy wishes vain! On a far distant, and remorseless shore, Where human fiends their dire libations pour; Where treachery, hov'ring o'er the blasted heath, Poises with ghastly smile the darts of death, Pierc'd by their venom'd points, your favorite bleeds, And on his limbs the lust of hunger feeds! Thus when, of old, the muse-born Orpheus bore Fair Arts and Virtues to the Thracian shore; Struck with sweet energy the warbling wire, And pour'd persuasion from th' immortal lyre; As soften'd brutes, the waving woods among, Bow'd their meek heads, and listen'd to the song; Near, and more near, with rage and tumult loud, Round the bold bard th' inebriate maniacs crowd— Red on the ungrateful soil his life-blood swims, And Fiends and Furies tear his quiv'ring limbs! Gay Eden of the south, thy tribute pay, And raise, in pomp of woe, thy Cook's Morai! The Morai is a kind of funeral altar, which the people of Otaheite raise to the memory of their deceased friends. They bring to it a daily tribute of fruits, flowers, and the plumage of birds. The chief mourner wanders around it in a state of apparent distraction, shrieking furiously, and striking at intervals a shark's tooth into her head. All people fly her, as she aims at wounding not only herself, but others. Bid mild Omiah bring his choicest stores, The juicy fruits, and the luxuriant flow'rs; Bring the bright plumes, that drink the torrid ray, And strew the lavish spoil on Cook's Morai! Come, Oberea, hapless fair-one! come, With piercing shrieks bewail thy Hero's doom!— She comes!—she gazes round with dire survey!— Oh! fly the mourner on her frantic way. See! see! the pointed ivory wounds that head, Where late the Loves impurpled roses spread; Now stain'd with gore, her raven tresses flow, In ruthless negligence of maddening woe; Loud she laments!—and long the Nymph shall stray With wild unequal step round Cook's Morai! But ah!—aloft on Albion's rocky steep, That frowns incumbent o'er the boiling deep, Solicitous, and sad, a softer form Eyes the lone flood, and deprecates the storm.— Ill-fated Matron!—far, alas! in vain Thy eager glances wander o'er the main!— 'Tis the vex'd billows, that insurgent rave, Their white foam silvers yonder distant wave, 'Tis not his sails!—thy Husband comes no more! His bones now whiten an accursed shore!— Retire,—for hark! the sea-gull shrieking soars, The lurid atmosphere portentous low'rs; Night's sullen spirit groans in ev'ry gale, And o'er the waters draws the darkling veil, Sighs in thy hair, and chills thy throbbing breast— Go, wretched Mourner!—Weep thy griefs to rest! Yet, though through life is lost each fond delight, Though set thy earthly sun in dreary night, Oh! raise thy thoughts to yonder starry plain, And own thy sorrow selfish, weak, and vain; Since, while Britannia, to his virtues just, Twines the bright wreath, and rears th' immortal bust; While on each wind of heav'n his fame shall rise, In endless incense to the smiling skies; The attendant Power, that bade his sails expand, And waft her blessings to each barren land, Now raptur'd bears him to the immortal plains, Where Mercy hails him with congenial strains; Where soars, on Joy's white plume, his spirit free, And angels choir him, while he waits for Thee. VERSES TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN. See the sky glows!—how fierce the beams of noon Pour their wide splendours o'er the yellow hill! But rosy hours fly fast;—dim Autumn soon Shall, from her drizzling urn, the gay green valley fill. Pale billows then shall cast a sickly gleam Through the thin umbrage of the rifled groves; Whose rustling leaves, thick show'ring, swell the stream, That drenches the 'lorn mead, and widens as it roves. With many a rising sigh for pleasures flown We view the destin'd ravage, cold, and drear; But let a few frore months be past and gone, And the sweet hour of prime shall renovate the year. But ah! no minstrel of the merry morn Shall wake to joy the icy sleep of Age; No purple wreaths the palsied brow adorn, Or chace of pain and death the desolate presage. Like broken lustres in the golden West, Now auburn tints gleam sunny in thy hair; And Youth's warm spirit, dancing in thy breast, Looks through thy shining eyes, and animates thy air. Seize the awaken'd moments—for they speed Thy light gay bark to Age's torpid wave; And with th' exalted thought, the generous deed, Quick, from Oblivion's gulph, thy rescu'd memory save! The Man, whose name on virtuous lips shall dwell, Disdains to think the mortal lot severe, Nor heeds the darkness of the funeral cell; Fame, and the Summer-Morn shall gild his passage there! ODE TO THE SUN. Published in May 1780. I. Lord of the Planets! in their course Through the long tracts of never-ceasing day, Who to their orbs with matchless force, Bendest their rapid, wild, reluctant way; Though midst the vast and glitt'ring maze Of countless worlds, that round thee blaze, Small, dim, and cold, our little Earth appears, Thy life-enkindling light she shares: From the chill Pole's far-shining mountains frore, Milton, in his Paradise Lost, uses that fine old word, synonimous to the common word frozen. —“The parching Air “Burns frore, and Cold performs the effect of Fire.” Also Spencer, “O! my heart's blood is well nigh frore, I feel.” To sandy Afric's sultry shore, Wide o'er her plains thy living lustres stream, In Lapland's long pale day, and swart Numidia's beam. II. For her, with delegated right, Thy virgin-sister in thy absence shines, Throws her soft robe of snowy light O'er sullen Night's opake and shadowy shrines; Thy watchful sentinel, she reigns Controuler of the watry plains, Onward her silver arm the Ocean guides, Or dashes back the impetuous tides. But thou, on the green wave's capacious bed, Hast light, and life, and gladness shed, Through liquid mountains, as they roll, Darting the beauteous beam, the vivifying soul, III. That paints the shell's meand'ring mould, Or spots the twinkling fin with gold; That gives the diamond's eye to blaze With all thy bright and arrowy rays.— Low in the billowy hold, Where the mighty whales are straying, And the burnish'd dolphins playing, There, with tremulous light, thou charmest Nations basking in thy gleam; And e'en there thy earth thou warmest With thy mild prolific beam: From the dwarf coral, with his vermil horns, Or sea-moss, matted round her briny caves, To the broad oak, that Albion's cliff adorns, And bears her sons triumphant o'er the waves; Each stem, root, leaf, fair fruit, and floret bright, Lustre and fragrance drink from thy all-cheering light. IV. Remov'd from its more ardent ray, In grassy Albion's deep umbrageous. vales, Thou bid'st them bloom in soft array, And breathe sweet incense on her vernal gales. Thy red Morn blushes on her shores, And liquid gems profusely pours; Thy gay Noon glows with unoppressive beams, And glitters on her winding streams; Thy modest Evening draws the deep'ning shades O'er her green hills, and bowery glades, Till the fair Months, with faded charms, Shrink in the chilly grasp of Winter's icy arms. V. But this highly-favoured year —This Ode was written at the end of that remarkable fine year, 1779, during which there was scarce any winter; but at that period England was involved in the ruinous miseries of the American war. From thee with gifts peculiar sprung; At thy command Autumna fair Her golden vest o'er shiv'ring Winter flung; And bade him his pale ling'ring hours Gaily deck with fragrant flow'rs; For his hoar brow matur'd the Violet wreath, From his wan lip bid Pleasure breathe; No more he blasts the plain, or warps the tide, Thou throw'st his icy bonds aside. His soften'd gale serenely blows, Till with Italia's charms hybernal Albion glows. VI. But see!—with bright hair drench'd in blood, On a rock that braves the flood, Her Genius sits, and pours the tear, Mindless of thy rosy year; Since War's terrific brood Bid in chains his Commerce languish, Fright his shrines with groans of anguish.— Great SUN! would lovely Peace, descending, Hither guide her dove-drawn car, And with thine her influence blending, Break the wintry clouds of War, Then should yon Angel-Form, that now deplores His wasted wealth, his bleeding joys, Rush from the rock, and, springing to the shores, Unbind fair Commerce, fetter'd where she lies; Indignant hurl those fetters to the main, As thou threw'st back, great Sun! old Hyems' icy chain. VERSES TO CAPTAIN ELIOTT, Written in the blank leaf of a manuscript Book, WHICH CONTAINED HIS POEMS. In life's gay more, in Circe's frolic train, Health to the youth wo shunn'd their tempting harms; Scorn'd his pure mind, and plighted faith, to stain With bowls inebriate, and with venal charms! And led the muse, where muses seldom rove, Where rudely clang'd Bellona's gore-stain'd shield; Sweet is the moral song, the lays of love That wak'd, and warbled o'er the tented field. For thee, 'mid prouder laurels of the war, Long may the bays their classic odours breathe! And the gay Goddess of the morning star, Twine the soft myrtle, and complete the wreath! For thee, th' impervious cloud again prepare, That veil'd her Paris on Scamander's plain; So, 'mid the volleying thunders of the war, Round thee its thousand bolts shall fly in vain. Yet, while the soft suffusion shields thy brow, A fate unlike the Trojan's may'st thou prove, Win the proud trophy from the flying foe, And live to Glory, while thou liv'st to Love! VERSES Inviting Mrs C—? to Tea on a public Fast-day, DURING THE AMERICAN WAR. Dear Stella, 'mid the pious sorrow Our monarch bids us feel to-morrow, The ahs! and ohs! supremely triste, The abstinence from beef, and whist; Wisely ordain'd to please the Lord, And force him whet our edgeless sword, Till, shipping o'er the Atlantic rill, We cut provincial throats at will; 'Midst all the penitence we feel For merry sins,—'midst all the zeal For vengeance on the saucy foe, Who lays our boasted legions low; I wish, when sullen evening comes, That you, to gild its falling glooms, Would, without scruple cold, agree Beneath these walls to sip your tea. From the chaste, fragrant, Indian weed Our sins no pampering juices feed; And though the hours, with contrite faces, May banish the ungodly aces, And take of food a sparing bit, They'll gluttonize on Stella's wit. “Tea!” cries a Patriot, “on that day 'Twere good you flung the drug away, Rememb'ring 'twas the cruel source Of sad distrust, and long divorce 'Twixt nations, which, combin'd, had hurl'd Their conquering javelin round the world. “O! Indian shrub, thy fragrant flowers To England's weal had deadly powers, When Despotism, with impious hand, To venom turn'd thine essence bland, To venom, subtle, foul, and fell, As steep'd the dart of Isdabel! “Have we forgot that dread libation Which cost the life of half the nation? When Boston, with indignant thought, Saw poison in the perfum'd draught, And caus'd her troubled bay to be Bot one vast bowl of bitter Tea; While Ate, Goddess of Vengeance. chiefly bidden guest, Came sternly to the fatal feast, And mingled with its baneful flood Brother's!—Children's!—Parent's blood; Dire as the banquet Atreus serv'd, When his own son Thyestes carv'd, And Phœbus, shrinking from the sight, Drew o'er his orb the pall of night. “To-morrow then, at least, refrain, Nor quaff thy bleeding country's bane! For O! reflect, poetic Daughter, 'Twas hapless Britain's laurel-water!” Alluding to captain Donellan's murder of sir Theodosius Boughton by laurel-water—an event, which at that time agitated the public mind considerably. See the Dying Indian in Dodsley's poems: “The dart of Isdabel prevails! 'twas dipt “In double poison.” ON THE FUTURE EXISTENCE OF BRUTES. “The beasts that perish.”—Those few words are shown On the dread pages of inspir'd Record, By Man, proud Man! as he were doom'd alone To meet, for guiltless pains, supreme reward. Yet knows he well, that on the leaves divine, Oft from the seeming sense we must refrain, And, lest warm Hope consistency resign, The letter wave, the spirit to obtain. For Brutal Life, while reasoning we explore The text misconstru'd much, it but declares That Man's free thoughts, and deeds import him more, Since this, his state of trial, is not theirs. To earthly life he perishes;—but here The vast momentous difference is implied, He perishes accountable—aware That choice was given, and reason for its guide. I mark the tones of arrogance exclaim, “Since they are form'd incapable of sin, “Of innocence instinctive where's the claim? “It well may be as it had never been” True, if permitted ills did ne'er oppress, If certain as their innocence, their peace, With the short date of being Brutes possess, Heaven might ordain their consciousness should cease: Yet not infringe those never altering laws Of equity and mercy, which combin'd To form the essence of th' Eternal Cause, Judge, Guardian, Friend of all existing kind. But since full oft the pangs of dire disease, Labour, and famine, and oppression hard, From cruel Man, the blameless victims seize; Of Heavenly Justice they may claim reward. Alas! the dumb defenceless numbers, found The wretched subjects of a tyrant's sway, Who hourly feel his unresisted wound, And hungry pine through many a weary day; Or those, of lot more barbarously severe, Who strain their weak, lame limbs beneath the load Their fainting strength is basely doom'd to bear, While smites the lash, the steely torments goad; Has God decreed this helpless, suffering train Shall groaning yield the vital breath he gave, Unrecompens'd for years of want, and pain, And close on them the portals of the grave? Ah, no! the great Retributory Mind Will recompense, and may perhaps ordain Some future mode of being, more refin'd Than ours, less sullied with inherent stain; Less torn by passion, and less prone to sin, Their duty easier, trial less severe, Till their firm faith, and virtue prov'd, may win The wreaths of Life in yon Eternal Sphere. This then may form the much rewarding doom;— But O! whate'er the nature of the meed, Theirs it must be; then let us now presume Their guiltless cause, on other grounds, to plead. Suppose permitted ills did not oppress, That certain as their innocence, their peace, And thus, that with the Being they possess, Sensation might, without injustice, cease; Yet still, proud Man! in this scorn'd tribe below Shall more than innocence thy pride impede, Nature, where all the generous ardours glow, And action, vying with thy noblest deed. If strength, if grace, if magnitude of frame, To give the dignifying power must fail, If not from them proceeds the sacred claim, That lifts the creature on creation's scale; If mind shall ever be to form preferr'd, Courage to force, to beauty sentiment, One Brute, at least, has powers, by heaven conferr'd, That for a doom oblivious were not lent. Ah! what but Heaven-born sentiment corrects, Refines,—adorns,—ennobles being? still From the contagious taint of vice protects, Controuls the organs, and exalts the will? This should'st thou feel, perforce then shalt thou see, That animal perfection must depend, Human and Brute alike, on the degree In which the lights of sentiment extend. In Brutal life if exquisite they prove, If Education may increase their force, If fond, intelligent, and faithful love Rise in the breast, and strengthen on its course; If, in a silent servitude to man, Energic friendship burns with generous strife, Say, can'st thou deem thy Dog's short, vital span Stopt on the confines of eternal life? His natural temper fervent, choleric, fierce, Nay bloody, see, by sentiment subdued! Subdued, for thee, to every soft reverse, For thee, in all its native rage renew'd! When unattach'd, and yet to Man unknown, Wolfish and wild, the wilderness he roves; Bays with his horrid howl the silent moon, And stalks the terror of the desert groves. Yet mark this heart of savage enterprise, Moulded by thee to all that's kind and sweet; See him approach with mild, imploring eyes, And lay his strength and courage at thy feet! Charm'd to exchange them for the soft delights Of growing love, his duteous head he lays Light on thy knee;—his lifted eye invites The wish'd command, which instant he obeys. At that known voice, with ardour, up he springs, And in the joy of usefulness elate, With gladden'd haste th' endear'd commission brings, Or drives intruding vagrants from thy gate. Thy wealth, thy person, anxious to protect, And gentle only to thy frequent friends, Nor bribe, nor flattery gain his coy respect, Useless the flattery, and the bribe offends! When Night broods sullen o'er the drowsy earth, Though faint with mid-day toil, he scorns repose, Leaves the warm comforts of the ember'd hearth, To guard thy slumbers, and appal thy foes; Watchful and listening, walks his silent rounds, Scenting the lurking stranger from afar, And, if he pass the interdicted bounds, The loud, indignant bark proclaims the war. Or Beast,—or Man,—is he to prey devote? With fangs terrific, and with burning eyes, Rushes thy brave protector on his throat, And low in blood the dark destroyer lies! But yet, if fear resign what theft supplied, He, pitying, from the prostrate foe recoils.— Mark then the victor, great in honest pride, Content with conquest, rest upon his spoils! Though high in health, the pleas of hunger strong In tempting opportunity arise, Generously proud, he scorns his trust to wrong, And all untouch'd the prey he rescu'd lies. Vainly do night and secrecy accord, This sacred sense of honour to controul! Can human records fairer proof afford, Of all that elevates a thinking soul? Exempt the nuptial, and the filial ties, Hast thou one Friend amongst the reasoning kind, On whom thy secret heart for truth relies Thus ardent, noble, constant and refin'd? To selfish passions thus superior found, Whom neither interest sways, nor arts beguile? To thee, in faith and trust, unfaultering bound, Thy will his law, his happiness thy smile. Ah, wretch ingrate, to liberal hope unknown! Does pride encrust thee in so dark a leaven, To deem this spirit, purer than thine own, Sinks, while thou soarest to the light of Heaven? What though, when Reason all her power displays, Drawn from philosophy's most copious source, Too subtle proves creation's endless maze For her best skill, to mighty for her force; Or, when she tries the mystery to explain Of the tremendous Expiatory Plan, Shows, only shows, how arrogant, how vain Such needless, daring scrutiny in Man; Yet, while Almighty Wisdom thus appears To human powers inscrutably sublime, Her gracious form Almighty Justice rears, Unveil'd, unchanging through the rounds of time. Hear, from the centre of the Eternal Throne, Her awful voice the fix'd award disclose, If evils over guiltless life are strewn, The God, who gave that life, will recompense its woes. TO MISS SEWARD. IMPROMPTU. As Britain mourn'd, with all a mother's pain, Two Sons, two gallant Sons, ignobly slain; Mild Cook, by savage fury robb'd of breath, And martial Andre doom'd to baser death! The Goddess, plung'd in grief too vast to speak, Hid in her robe her tear-disfigur'd cheek. The sacred Nine, with sympathetic care, Survey'd the noble mourner's dumb despair; While from their choir the sighs of pity broke, The Muse of Elegy thus warmly spoke: “Take, injured Parent, all we can bestow, “To soothe thy heart, and mitigate thy woe!” Speaking, to earth the kind enthusiast came, And veil'd her heavenly power with Seward's name; And that no vulgar eye might pierce the truth, Proclaim'd herself the friend of Andre's youth. In that fair semblance, with such plaintive fire, She struck the chords of her pathetic lyre, The weeping Goddess owns the blest relief, And fondly listens, with subsiding grief; Her loveliest daughters lend a willing ear, Honouring the latent Muse with many a tear. Her bravest sons, who in their every vein Feel the strong pathos of the magic strain, Bless the enchanting lyre, by glory strung, Envying the dead, who are so sweetly sung. W. Hayley. MONODY ON MAJOR ANDRE. Loud howls the storm! the vex'd Atlantic roars! Thy genius, Britain, wanders on its shores! Hears cries of horror wafted from afar, And groans of anguish, mid the shrieks of war! Hears the deep curses of the great and brave, Borne in the wind, and echoing o'er the wave! On his damp brow the sable crape he binds, And throws his victor-garland Alluding to the conquest by Lord Cornwallis. to the winds; Bids haggard Winter, in her drear sojourn, Tear the dim foliage from her drizzling urn; With sickly yew unfragrant cypress twine, And hang the dusky wreath round Honour's shrine; Bids steel-clad Valour chace his dove-like bride, Enfeebling Mercy, from his awful side, Where long she sat, and check'd the glowing rein, As whirl'd his chariot o'er the embattled plain; Gilded with sunny smile her April tear, Rais'd her white arm and stay'd th' uplifted spear; Then, in her place, bids Vengeance mount the car, And glut with gore the insatiate dogs of war!— With one pale hand the bloody scroll The Court-martial decree, signed at Tappan, for Major Andre's execution. he rears, And bids his nations blot it with their tears; And one, extended o'er th' atlantic wave, Points to his Andre's ignominious grave! And shall the Muse, that marks the solemn scene, “As busy fancy lifts the veil between,” Refuse to mingle in the awful train, Nor breathe with glowing zeal the votive strain? From public fame shall admiration fire The boldest numbers of her raptur'd lyre To hymn a stranger?—and with ardent lay Lead the wild mourner round her Cook's morai, While Andre fades upon his dreary bier, And Julia's The name by which Mr Andre addressed the author in his correspondence with her. only tribute is her tear? Dear, lovely Youth! whose gentle virtues stole Through Friendship's soft'ning medium on her soul! Ah no!—with every strong resistless plea, Rise the recorded days she pass'd with thee, While each dim shadow of o'erwhelming years, With eagle-glance reverted, Memory clears. Belov'd companion of the fairest hours That rose for her in joy's resplendent bow'rs, How gaily shone on thy bright morn of Youth The Star of Pleasure, and the Sun of Truth! Full from their source descended on thy mind Each generous virtue and each taste refined. Young Genius led thee to his varied fane, Bade thee ask all his gifts, Mr Andre had conspicuous talents for poetry, music, and painting. The newspapers mentioned a satiric poem of his upon the Americans, which was supposed to have stimulated their barbarity towards him. Of his wit and vivacity, the letters subjoined to this poem afford ample proof. They were addressed to the author by Mr Andre when he was a Youth of eighteen. nor ask in vain; Hence novel thoughts in ev'ry lustre drest Of pointed wit, that diamond of the breast; Hence glow'd thy fancy with poetic ray, Hence music warbled in thy sprightly lay; And hence thy pencil, with his colours warm, Caught ev'ry grace, and copied ev'ry charm, Whose transient glories beam on beauty's cheek, And bid the glowing ivory breathe and speak. Blest pencil! by kind fate ordain'd to save Honora's semblance from her early grave. Miss Honora S?, to whom Mr Andre's attachment was of such singular constancy, died in a consumption, a few months before he suffered death at Tappan. She had married another gentleman, four years after her connection with Mr Andre had, by parental authority, been dissolved. To that marriage her father gave a reluctant consent. So groundless was the idea of the Reviewers, who, when this poem was first published, imagined, from some expressions, whose sense they had mistaken, that she was urged into wedlock against her inclination. Oh! while on Julia's arm Mr Andre drew two miniature pictures of Miss Honora S?, on his first acquaintance with her at Buxton, in the year 1769, one for himself, the other for the author of this poem. it sweetly smiles, And each lorn thought, each long regret beguiles, Fondly she weeps the hand, which form'd the spell, Now shroudless mould'ring in its earthy cell! But sure the Youth, whose ill-starr'd passion strove With all the pangs of inauspicious love, Full oft deplor'd the fatal art, that stole The jocund freedom of its Master's soul! While with nice hand he mark'd the living grace, And matchless sweetness of Honora's face, The enamour'd youth the faithful traces blest, That barb'd the dart of Beauty in his breast; Around his neck th' enchanting portrait hung, While a warm vow burst ardent from his tongue, That from his bosom no succeeding day, No chance should bear that talisman away. 'Twas thus Apelles bask'd in beauty's rays, And felt the mischief of the stedfast gaze; Trac'd with disorder'd hand Campaspe's charms, And as their beam the kindling canvas warms, Triumphant love, with still superior art, Engraves their wonders on the Painter's heart. Dear lost companion! ever constant youth! That fate had smil'd propitious on thy truth! Nor bound th' ensanguin'd laurel on that brow, Where Love ordain'd his brightest wreath to glow! Then Peace had led thee to her softest bow'rs, And Hymen strew'd thy path with all his flow'rs; Drawn to thy roof, by friendship's silver cord, Each social joy had brighten'd at thy board; Science, and soft affection's blended rays Had shone unclouded on thy lengthen'd days; From hour to hour thy taste, with conscious pride, Had mark'd new talents in thy lovely bride; Till thou hadst own'd the magic of her face Thy fair Honora's least engaging grace. Dear lost Honora! o'er thy early bier Sorrowing the muse still sheds her sacred tear! The blushing rose-bud in its vernal bed, By zephyrs fann'd, by glist'ring dew-drops fed, In June's gay morn that scents the ambient air, Was not more sweet, more innocent, or fair. Oh! when such pairs their kindred spirit find, When sense and virtue deck each spotless mind, Hard is the doom that shall the union break, And fate's dark billow rises o'er the wreck. Now Prudence, in her cold and thrifty care, Frown'd on the maid, and bade the youth despair; For power parental sternly saw, and strove To tear the lily bands of plighted love; Nor strove in vain;—but while the fair-one's sighs Disperse like April-storms in sunny skies, The firmer lover, with unswerving truth, To his first passion consecrates his youth; Though four long years a night of absence prove, Yet Hope's soft star shone trembling on his love; Till hovering rumour The tidings of Honora's marriage: Upon that event Mr Andre quitted his profession as a merchant, and joined our army in America. chas'd the pleasing dream, And veil'd with raven-wing the silver beam. “Honora lost! my happy rival's bride! “Swell, ye full sails! and roll, thou mighty tide! “O'er the dark waves forsaken Andre bear “Amid the volleying thunders of the war! “To win bright glory from my country's foes, “E'en in this ice of love, my bosom glows. “Voluptuous London! in whose gorgeous bow'rs “The frolic Pleasures lead the dancing Hours, “From orient vales sabæan odours bring, “Nor ask her roses of the tardy Spring; “Where Painting burns the Grecian meed to claim, “From the high temple of immortal Fame, “Bears to the radiant goal, with ardent pace, “Her Kauffman's beauty, and her Reynolds' grace; “Where music floats the glitt'ring roofs among, “And with meand'ring cadence swells the song, “While sun-clad poesy the bard inspires, “And foils the Grecian harps, the Latian lyres.— “Ye soft'ning luxuries! ye polish'd arts! “Bend your enfeebling rays on tranquil hearts! “I quit the song, the pencil, and the lyre, “White robes of peace, and pleasure's soft attire, “To seize the sword, to mount the rapid car, “In all the proud habiliments of war.— “Honora lost!

To the full gale the nearer billows roar, And proudly lash the circumscribing shore; While furious on the craggy coast they rave, All calm and lovely rolls the distant wave; For onward, as the unbounded waters spread, Deep sink the rocks in their capacious bed, And all their pointed terror's utmost force But gently interrupts the billows course. So on his present hour rude passion preys, So smooth the prospect of his future days; Unconscious of the storm, that grimly sleeps, To wreck its fury on th' unshelter'd deeps. Now yielding waves divide before the prow, The white sails bend, the streaming pennants glow, And swiftly waft him to the western plain, Where fierce Bellona rages o'er the slain. Firm in their strength opposing legions stand, Prepar'd to drench with blood the thirsty land. Now Carnage hurls her flaming bolts afar, And Desolation groans amid the war. As bleed the valiant, and the mighty yield, Death stalks, the only victor o'er the field. Foremost in all the horrors of the day, Impetuous Andre leads the glorious way; Till, rashly bold, by numbers fore'd to yield, They drag him captive from the long-fought field.— Around the hero croud th' exulting bands, And seize the spoils of war with bloody hands; Snatch the dark plumage from his awful crest, And tear the golden crescent from his breast; The sword, the tube that wings the death from far, And all the fatal implements of war! Silent, unmov'd, the gallant youth survey'd The lavish spoils triumphant ruffians made; The idle ornament, the useless spear He little recks, but oh! there is a fear Pants with quick throb, while yearning sorrows dart Through his chill frame, and tremble at his heart. “What though Honora's voice no more shall charm! “No more her beamy smile my bosom warm! “Yet from these eyes shall force for ever tear “The sacred image of that form so dear?— “Shade of my love! The miniature of Honora. A letter from Major Andre to one of his friends, written at that period, contained the following sentence. “I have been taken prisoner by the Americans, and stript of every thing except the picture of Honora, which I concealed in my mouth. Preserving that, I yet think myself fortunate.” —though mute and cold thy charms, “Ne'er hast thou blest my happy rival's arms! “To my sad heart each dawn has seen thee prest! “Each night has laid thee pillow'd on my breast! “Force shall not tear thee from thy faithful shrine; “Shade of my love! thou shalt be ever mine! “'Tis fixed!—these lips shall resolute inclose “The precious soother of my ceaseless woes. “And should relentless violence invade “This last retreat, by frantic fondness made, “One way remains!—Fate whispers to my soul “Intrepid Portia “Brutus. Impatient of my absence, “And grieved that young Octavius, with Mark Antony “Had made themselves so strong, she grew distract, “And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.” Julius Cæsar, act 4. sc. 4. and her burning coal! “So shall the throbbing inmate of my breast “From love's sole gift meet everlasting rest!” While these sad thoughts in swift succession fire The smother'd embers of each fond desire, Quick to his mouth his eager hand removes The beauteous semblance of the form he loves. That darling treasure safe, resign'd he wears The sordid robe, the scanty viand shares; With chearful fortitude content to wait The barter'd ransom of a kinder fate. Now many moons in their pale course had shed The pensive beam on Andre's captive head. At length the sun rose jocund, to adorn With all his splendour the enfranchis'd morn. Again the hero joins the ardent train That pours its thousands on the tented plain; And shines distinguish'd in the long array, Bright as the silver star that leads the day! His modest temperance, his wakeful heed, His silent diligence, his ardent speed, Each warrior-duty to the veteran taught, Shaming the vain experience time had brought. Dependence scarcely feels his gentle sway, He shares each want, and smiles each grief away; And to the virtues of a noble heart, Unites the talents of inventive art; Since from his swift and faithful pencil flow The lines, the camp, the fortress of the foe; Serene to counteract each deep design, Points the dark ambush, and the springing mine; Till, as a breathing incense, Andre's name Pervades the host, and swells the loud acclaim. The Chief no virtue views with cold regard, Skill'd to discern, and generous to reward; Each tow'ring hope his honor'd smiles impart, As near his person, and more near his heart The graceful youth he draws,—and round his brow Bids rank and pow'r their mingled brilliance throw. Oh! hast thou seen a blooming morn of May In crystal beauty shed the modest ray, And with its balmy dew's refreshing show'r Swell the young grain, and ope the purple flow'r, With brightning lustre melt in radiant noon, Rob'd in the gayest mantle of the sun? Then 'mid the splendours of its azure skies, Oh! hast thou seen the cruel storm arise, In sable horror shroud each dazzling charm, And dash their glories back with icy arm? Thus lour'd the deathful cloud amid the blaze Of Andre's rising hopes, and quench'd their rays! Ah fatal embassy!—thy hazards dire His kindling soul with ev'ry ardour fire. As fair Euryalus, to meet his fate, With Nysus rushes from the Dardan gate, Relentless fate! whose fury scorns to spare The snowy breast, red lip, and shining hair, So graceful Andre launches on the waves, Where Hudson's tide its dreary confine laves. With firm intrepid foot the youth explores Each dangerous pathway of the hostile shores; But on no veteran-chief his step attends, As silent round the gloomy wood he wends; Alone he meets the brave repentant foe, Sustains his late resolve, receives his vow, With ardent skill directs the doubtful course, Seals the firm bond, and ratifies its force. 'Tis thus, America, thy generals fly, And raise new banners in their native sky! Sick of the mischiefs artful Gallia pours, In friendly semblance on thy ravag'd shores. Unnatural compact!—shall a race of slaves Sustain the ponderous standard Freedom waves? No! while their feign'd protection spreads the toils, The vultures hover o'er the destin'd spoils. How fade provincial glories, while ye run To court far deeper bondage than ye shun! Is this the generous active rising flame, That boasted liberty's immortal name, Blaz'd for its rights infring'd, its trophies torn, And taught the wise the dire mistake to mourn, When haughty Britain, in a luckless hour, With rage inebriate, and the lust of pow'r, To fruitless conquest, and to countless graves Led her gay legions o'er the western waves? The Fiend of Discord, cow'ring at the prow, Sat darkly smiling at th' impending woe! Long did my soul the wretched strife survey, And wept the horrors of the deathful day; Through rolling years saw undecisive War Drag bleeding Wisdom at his iron car; Exhaust my country's treasure, pour her gore In fruitless conflict on the distant shore; Saw the firm Congress all her might oppose, And while I mourn'd her fate, rever'd her foes. But when, repentant of her prouder aim, She gently waves the long disputed claim; Extends the charter with your rights restor'd, And hides in olive wreaths the blood-stain'd sword; Then to reject her peaceful wreaths, and throw Your Country's freedom to our mutual foe!— Infatuate land!—from that detested day Distracted councils, and the thirst of sway, Rapacious avarice, superstition vile, And all the Frenchman dictates in his guile Disgrace your Congress!—Justice drops her scale! And radiant Liberty averts her sail! They fly indignant the polluted plain, Where truth is scorn'd, and mercy pleads in vain. That she does plead in vain, thy witness bear, Accursed hour!—thou darkest of the year! That with misfortune's deadliest venom fraught, To Tappan's plain the gallant Andre brought. Oh Washington! I thought thee great and good, Nor knew thy Nero-thirst of guiltless blood! Severe to use the pow'r that fortune gave, Thou cool determin'd murderer of the brave! Lost to each fairer virtue, that inspires The genuine fervour of the patriot fires! And you, the base abettors of the doom, That sunk his blooming honours in the tomb, Th' opprobrious tomb your harden'd hearts decreed, While all he ask'd was as the brave to bleed! No other boon the glorious youth implor'd Save the cold mercy of the warrior-sword! O dark, and pitiless! your impious hate O'er-whelm'd the hero in the ruffian's fate! Stopt with the felon-cord the rosy breath! And venom'd with disgrace the darts of death! Remorseless Washington! the day shall come Of deep repentance for this barb'rous doom! When injur'd Andre's memory shall inspire A kindling army with resistless fire; Each falchion sharpen that the Britons wield, And lead their fiercest lion to the field! Then, when each hope of thine shall set in night, When dubious dread, and unavailing flight Impel your host, thy guilt-upbraided soul Shall wish untouch'd the sacred life The concurrent testimony even of the British officers, during the years which have elapsed since this poem was first published, acquits general Washington of that imputed cruelty, which had so forcibly impressed the grieved heart of the author, concerning the sacrifice of major Andre's life. They acknowledge that there was but one way to have saved the gallant sufferer, viz. by general Arnold having been given up in exchange, who had fled to the English army. It was believed by the American officers, that general Arnold had so taken his measures, that if the projected interview with Andre had been discovered, while they were together, it might have been in his power to have sacrificed Andre to his own safety. This report was urged to the prisoner by an American officer, commissioned from general Washington, who wished his preservation, to induce him to write to general Clinton, requesting him to propose the exchange—but major Andre would not listen a moment to the suggestion. However, though it is urged, that general Washington could not, with safety to himself, and justice to his country, set aside the decision of the court-martial, surely it was in his power to have rendered the manner in which major Andre was to suffer, less wounding to the sensibility of an intrepid spirit. you stole! And when thy heart appall'd, and vanquish'd pride Shall vainly ask the mercy they deny'd, With horror shalt thou meet the fate thou gave, Nor pity gild the darkness of thy grave! For infamy, with livid hand, shall shed Eternal mlldew on the ruthless head! Less cruel far than thou, on Ilium's plain Achilles, raging for Patroclus slain! When hapless Priam bends the aged knee, To deprecate the victor's dire decree, The generous Greek, in melting pity spares The lifeless Hector to his father's pray'rs, Fierce as he was;—'tis cowards only know Persisting vengeance o'er a fallen foe. But no intreaty wakes the soft remorse, Oh murder'd Andre! for thy sacred corse; Vain were an army's, vain its leader's sighs!— Damp in the earth on Hudson's shore it lies! Unshrouded welters in the wint'ry storm, And gluts the riot of the Tappan The place where major Andre was put to death.-worm! But Oh! its dust, like Abel's blood, shall rise, And call for justice from the angry skies! What though the tyrants, with malignant pride, To thy pale corse each decent rite denied! Thy graceful limbs in no kind covert laid, Nor with the christian requiem sooth'd thy shade! Yet on thy grass-green bier soft April-show'rs Shall earliest wake the sweet spontaneous flow'rs! Bid the blue hare-bell, and the snow-drop there Hang their cold cup, and drop the pearly tear! And oft, at pensive eve's ambiguous gloom, Imperial Honour, bending o'er thy tomb, With solemn strains shall lull thy deep repose, And with his deathless laurels shade thy brows! Lamented youth! while with inverted spear The British legions pour th' indignant tear! Round the dropt arm the funeral-scarf Our whole army in America went into mourning for major Andre, a distinguished tribute to his merit. entwine, And in their hearts' deep core thy worth enshrine; While my weak muse, in fond attempt and vain, But feebly pours a perishable strain, Oh! ye distinguish'd few! whose glowing lays Bright Phœbus kindles with his purest rays, Snatch from its radiant source the living fire, Andlight with vestal flame your Andre's hallow'd Pyre! ODE TO POETIC FANCY. Warm in May's pellucid noon See Love and Beauty wanton o'er the vale Which the young spring has green'd;—and lo! they hail Thee, Fancy, rival of the sun; Thou, who with brighter red canst deck the rose That by yon glassy fountain blows; A more voluptuous odour breathe On ardent Summer's spicy wreath, Or wake, with powers to higher aims consign'd, The tender buds of joy in the enlighten'd mind. With bounding step the Goddess comes, Bending on high her gay, aerial bow; The splendid Phœnix' golden plumes O'er her fair brow in loose effulgence flow! Each various hue of colour'd light Quick glances o'er the silver'd white Resplendent in her vest, And the bright beam of extacy Flashes triumphant from her eye, And swells her polish'd breast; While Zeuxis' pencil, Orpheus' lyre, Pygmalion's heaven-descended fire, The smiling pleasures bring, as round they throng, And hymn, in sportive tone, her last enchanting song. This Ode was written on the publication of Mr Hayley's Triumphs of Temper. That song, which to her Hayley's ear Whilom she breath'd in transport gay and loud. See Ariosto's spirit, from yon cloud, Stoops, the congenial notes to hear. His glad eye marks an Elfin Sprite descend, Elfin Sprite.—Sophrosyne, the Goddess of Mr Hayley's supernatural machinery in that poem. From many a mystic orb to rend The veil, that dimly spread between, Their secrets hid from mortal ken. The curtain falls!—and to our wondering sight Sophrosyne appears, amid new worlds of light. O, Fancy! with fastidious smile Though Dulness, and though Envy may proclaim That thou, in thy distinguish'd isle, Art of diminish'd power, and faded fame, The Delphic treasure of this day, The magic of thy Hayley's lay, Shall prove the slander vain; Since seldom have more vivid shone The lustre of thy rain-bow zone, Or sweeter trill'd the strain, Than when on Hayley's open brow Thou bad'st thy loveliest garland glow, When all thy powers endow'd his favour'd rhyme, Pleasure's envermil'd light, and Horror's shade sublime. When pale Misfortune's ruthless gale, Ice-breath'd and fell, has those soft streams controul'd, That from the silver fount of comfort roll'd Quiet adown this mortal vale; O, Fancy, but for thee, mild Hope had stood Blighted beside the frozen flood; E'en halcyon Love with ruffled plume Had sunk amid the gathering gloom; But thou again can'st melt th' arrested waves, Till in their clear, warm tide, the shivering spirit laves. Each persecuting fiend of life Thy wand controuls, at least with transient sway; Smooth grows the furrow'd brow of Strife, Smiles on the haggard cheek of Avarice play; Terror drops the extended wing, And Envy sheaths her venom'd sting, Darting at others good; E'en gaunt Ambition, from his car Unyokes the fiery steeds of war, Dark with the stains of blood; Pale Grief, from veiled lids, no more Sheds the lone, incessant shower; Her dim eye brightens in thy soften'd rays, As, raising slow her head, she listens to thy lays. For her thou lay'st thy glories by, A veil extending o'er each dazzling hue, That Sorrow's tear-swoln eye would ache to view, As splendid insults on her frequent sigh. Congenial drops suffuse thy radiant glance, Suspension stays thy bounding dance; The foliage wild, the dusky plume, Succeeding to each gaudy bloom, With gentle breath thou fill'st the pensive shell, Attun'd to April gales, in Echo's airy cell. Where'er thou rov'st, enchanting Maid, To soothe the hapless, or the gay to charm; Return thou still to Hayley's shade, With every sacred inspiration warm! From the coy dell, and lavish bower, Bring every zest of every flower, In graceful gift and free; For gentle Love, and Virtue there, With letter'd Taste, an altar rear To Happiness and thee. O! hither bring thy purest fire, To sublimate each low desire! So with augmenting lustre shall it shine, The sweet abode of Peace, and thine own chosen shrine. EPISTLE TO CORNELIA. Cornelia, yes, it would be hard to find The leading impulse of Belinda's mind, When, in the motley band, that forms her train, The gay, the proud, the indolent, the vain, Ardent she boasts a longing wish to view Such ill-match'd spirits join her modish crew, Those, who nor share her pleasures, nor supply, Things so unlike herself, as Thou, and I! Three sheets, this day, one bounteous packet brought Full of strange trifling with exalted thought; Our fair Arachne's web, so fond to spread, From films internal, every glittering thread; Since from no stores the verbal textures spring, That books, that anecdote, that science bring; Through sentimental mazes finely spun Wide in eternal circles smooth they run, Attenuant rivals of the silvery lines That float in air when Summer's morning shines. How warm she boasts the intercourse refin'd, The kindred virtue, the congenial mind! Such as illum'd (she vows) her glittering bowers, When lov'd Cornelia's converse wing'd the hours; When all the mental graces, led by thee, Made, only not Elysium—wanting me! Friend of my youth, what Cynic could upbraid The laugh of scorn, when in thy tints array'd, Those consecrated hours before us roll, Their feasts of reason, and their flow of soul? Thee, summon'd to adorn that festal board, With all that Friendship, Science, Wit afford, Thee when we view, consign'd, with air serene. By the fair mistress of th' Arcadian scene, Consign'd in turn to ev'ry ancient beau, Obsequious cringing in the splendid shew; While she in mystic rites consumes the morn, The fancied vestment studious to adorn; Tried at the mirror,—tried,—and still retried, Ah! willing labour of assiduous pride! Light till it floats in elegance supreme, Each Rival's envy, each Admirer's theme; And when, as the late dinner-bell around Spreads, through the gay saloon, the silver sound, The nymph descends amid the dazzled throng. Each mirror ogling as she glides along, To glut her senses and to charm her eyes With food more grateful than the board supplies, Pil'd though it be with all of rich and rare That glides the ater, or that wings the air; Till they, with every native semblance chang'd, In taste Parisian flavor'd and arrang'd, Wake the pale Epicure's keen hope, and vie With Gallic Perigord's recorded pie. Round for a dearer feast she looks the while, With triumph's gay anticipating smile; For those wish'd flatteries, that reward and bless The morning labours o'er the evening dress. And there, encircled by the gaudy shew, By every bauble, and by every beau, Musing I see my sage Cornelia sit, Inly repentant of her wasted wit; Launch'd twice, or thrice, around the glittering board, 'Mid belles, and sparks, the colonel, and my lord; With aim as lucky, and with equal lot As the keen arrow at the wool-pack shot; See her in speechless eloquence resign All hope one fashionable theme to join; “Charmant the Opera!—Theatre, how triste!” Each step of Vestris, and each chance of whist; Or,—when the gilded drawing-room invites To yield victorious Pam his wonted rites, Listless, and leaning o'er Belinda's chair Bend on the velvet board the vacant stare; Much marvelling what spell her footsteps drew To such a maze of nothingness and Loo! Thus past those hours, a lavish pen pourtray'd As blest by friendship, and in wit array'd; Belinda, boast them long!—since ne'er again Cornelia figures in thy modish train. I, who had ne'er beheld this dame refin'd, This cloud-formed friend, this meteor of a mind, But when the shades of languor, and of pain, Screen'd every passion, frivolous and vain, Lur'd by her specious tenderness, impart The bleeding griefs that rankled at my heart; Death, recent death of her my soul held dear, The pang'd remembrance, the incessant tear; The mortal dart shook o'er a mother's head, The night's despondence, and the morning's dread. Lo! in reply to all her eye had met Of filial grief, and friendship's long regret, Her answering pages eloquently rave Of every joy Cornelia's converse gave; And of her own charm'd thoughts, that love to greet Me, happy me! amid my green retreat, Where still, she tells me, smiling fortune blends The glad society of polish'd friends With melting music, and the strains divine Of Poesy inspir'd by all the nine. Replying thus to lines, where heart-sick woe Sought in her breast kind pity's balmy flow, She proves it, in profession's spite, their lot Ne'er to be read, or instantly forgot. Type of such hearts, amid the garden's store, Their gifts where Flora and Pomona pour, Shines the gay orange-gourd, of gorgeous grain, In lavish promise, and allurement vain. Who would not guess its splendid veins supplied Streams, rich as gush from Seville's golden pride? But ah! less taste, less nutriment it yields Than the uncultur'd weed that choaks the fields; The watry juice within that glowing mould Is vapid, sick'ning, colourless, and cold. Cornelia, skill'd to trace, with reason's force, Each action's motive to its secret source, Say why Belinda, to such fruitless end, Apes, what she ne'er was form'd to be,—a Friend? A Friend to us, whose granted faith must bring Intrusive homage on a flagging wing. Ah! wherefore grasping at such barren power, Defraud her toilet of one precious hour; Why these warm phrases, that to Friendship prove A mockery vain, as Coquetry to Love; This pomp of kindness, that thus idly feigns, Joyless exults, and sorrowless complains; These wandering lights—this cold, this meteor fire, Lit to mislead, and blazing to expire? Perchance, in Sorrow's mazes doom'd to stray, Fondly we deem its ineffectual ray, As the illusive gleams before us glide, To Friendship's shelter our auspicious guide. Hope, whose rash course wise Doubt not oft impedes, Smiles through her tears, and follows where it leads; Till round her erring footsteps, startled, checkt, Rise the cold billows of confirm'd neglect. From such vain models spleen'd Museus Museus.—The name Mason allots to Pope in his beautiful Monody on that Poet. drew The light camelion nymphs that meet our view, While in the immortal beauty of his lays Lives bold Injustice to remotest days. Such though there be,—twin Sisters of the Fair Who spreads for us the sentimental snare, Ah! do the empty tribe his fancy paints, Dispassion'd Sinners, and voluptuous Saints, Coquets, that seize the Sage's clue, and spin it, With all the cloud-form'd Cynthias of the minute, Do these epitomize the female kind, Than man more virtuous, more than man refin'd? How many duteous maids to filial cares Yield unrepining all their rosy years! How many fair and faithful wives sustain From base ingratitude the keenest pain, Feel ev'ry woe that broken vows create, Deepen'd by cold neglect, or sullen hate! The Sot, returning from his midnight crew Each loathsome night, how many live to view; In outrag'd delicacy shudder near, Breathe the scorn'd sigh, and shed th' unheeded tear; Their lot in bitterness of thought endure, Nor once reproach for ills they cannot cure!— What grieving numbers find the wealth they brought Melt in Profusion's spilt and needless draught; Or stores, that might exempt from hourly fear, From mean dependence, and from want severe, Their injur'd selves,—their little ones,—behold Risqu'd in the avarice of superfluous gold; The Gamester's desperate avarice,—more unjust Injurious, baleful, than the sordid lust That goads the Miser to increase his gain, Freezing his heart 'gainst ev'ry thought humane! Through trials, hard as these, how oft are seen The tender Sex, in fortitude serene; Revenge unsought, and injuries unreveal'd, Each wrong forgiven, and each fault conceal'd! Whate'er of Woman's frailty ye have known, Own then, Creation's Lords, impartial own, If right, or wrong, the spleenful Bard defin'd The general texture of the female mind! Say, do two passions only sway our soul, The thirst of pleasure, and of proud controul? And, while the mortals masculine pursue The various object, seen in various view, As “some to business, some to pleasure take,” Is “every woman at her heart a Rake?” Says Hogarth's pencil so?—that through the will Trac'd hidden impulse with unerring skill; That firm, and faithful to his moral views, Drew real life in nature's genuine hues; And with more striking, more resistless force, Warns lurking vice, on her progressive course, Than all that poignant wit, in nervous rhyme, Rouses, to lash a folly, or a crime. See, in its speaking tints, the ruin'd maid, First plate in the Rake's Progress. By solemn vows, and tender trust betray'd, From perjur'd love, with bursting grief, depart, His gold refusing, who recalls his heart! Yet, 'mid the prospect dire of all that strows The path of Woman with the sharpest woes, O'er his deep crimes her darkest fears impend; For their dread doom her bitterest tears descend! Environ'd as she is by every ill, To her heart's first impression faithful still, Round his lov'd image yet resistless rise Thrill'd recollections of their former joys; Those pleading accents! that impassion'd sigh! The shining ardours of that lucid eye, Whose glance might thaw, with its enamour'd glow, “On Dian's lap the consecrated snow!” Smote by sore famine and the Winter's wind, To keen reproach and taunting scorn consign'd, And oft to her chill'd bosom pressing wild, Pledge of his love, her little, helpless child, Near the false youth she strays, unseen, unknown, His fate more dreading, than she dreads her own. While Love's deserter, Fashion's bubbled tool, Compound abhorr'd of villain and of fool! His hours in flatter'd ostentation wastes, Ere to the orgies of the night he hastes. Then what an odious groupe the board surround! See the second plate—the Brothel. Here sottish filthiness distains the ground; There lolls detested Lewdness, lost to shame, Here to the pictur'd Globe applies the flame; O speaking emblem of the mortal doom When Sin's dread fires the general peace consume! Ere fully play'd Profusion's desperate part, Wasting that wealth, which harden'd first his heart, Through her wild vortex as the false-one goes, An happier lot the sweet Forsaken knows. 'Gainst new temptation proof, though doom'd to mourn, She rises o'er the woes of Want and Scorn; Ingenious Industry resource affords, Its efforts decent Competence rewards. Behold the pencil's power display again, The heart of Woman, and the vice of Man! See the third plate—the Arrestment. Round the gay Wretch, clos'd in the tossel'd chair, Law's ruthless ministers severely glare; Drag towards the lonely prison's dim retreat Th' embroider'd victim from his gilded seat. Her pensive step by chance conducted there, Mark the too faithful, the too generous fair! See her, with streaming eyes, the scene behold, See! in that injur'd hand the rescuing gold! Sav'd from the reckless debtor's bound forlorn By her, whom he betray'd to want and scorn, Preserv'd, yet thankless, sullen, cold, and rude, Steel'd 'gainst remorse, and dead to gratitude, From the imploring look, the warning sighs, To the mean refuge of his vice he flies. Now, in another speaking scene display'd, See the fourth plate—the Marriage. Rise the loose Rake, and violated Maid; We see him at the outrag'd altar stand, Breathe the false vows, and plight th' insidious hand; Vows, to yon hapless Fair-one only due, Afflicted, sinking in a distant pew, She hears the prostituted Youth engage To loath'd deformity and wither'd age. Wealth thus re-purchas'd at a price so base, Again he runs profusion's headlong race; Again her drains have sunk the golden pile, And made the odious Hymen vain as vile. At length the fate of folly and of vice Hurl'd, past redemption, by the loaded dice, All, all its horrors now the false-one feels; See! in demoniac agony, he kneels! See the fifth plate—the Gaming Table. See eyes uprais'd, in desperation fierce, On his own head invoke the direful curse! It falls!—the careless phrenzy fires his brain, And whips and stripes, and manacles remain. Beyond e'en all sweet Prior's lays impart Of the firm texture of the female heart, When gentle Emma rises o'er the snare That groundless doubt, and jealousy prepare, View life's just Limner eminently prove “The faith of Woman, and the force of Love;” See the last plate—Bedlam. The last sad scene of guilt aveng'd disclose, And its fair victim's voluntary woes. And now unveil'd, beneath the pencil's truth, Stands the accomplish'd doom of perjur'd Youth. Where yelling Bedlam shuts, to darkness hurl'd. The furious maniac from the trembling world; Chang'd for its horrid dungeon's dreariest shade. Her decent table, and her downy bed, See on his straw that injur'd form reclin'd, Her wrongs forgotten, to her dangers blind, And scorning the strong sense of corporal pain, Scarce feel her bruises from the rattling chain! One struggling arm her soft arms fold around;— The gash'd head bleeding from the self-struck wound, Towards the blank floor, with hideous laugh, he turns, Nor heeds the guardian form, that o'er him mourns. Shock'd, yet assiduous to assuage his woe, While on his writhing limbs her eyes o'erflow, Fain would her soothing tones to rest beguile The dire contortion and the ghastly smile! Satiric pupils of Museus' train, Echoing your Master's dogmas, false and vain, The just, the life-drawn scene consider well, And then in this, a female bosom, tell Which passion govern'd through each hapless hour, The love of pleasure, or the love of power! From constancy, above their reach, or aim, Who female fickleness aloud proclaim, Turn we, Cornelia, to thy happier life, Thou duteous Daughter, and thou faithful Wife, Whom beauty's dangerous gifts and triumphs ne'er To indolence, or vanity's soft snare, Once tempted; thou, that in youth's jocund hours Sought truth and science, in their classic bowers; Yet whom nor they, nor all the fame they brought, When wits admired thee, and when sages sought, Seduced one duty to resign, that spreads The smile of peace, the balm of comfort sheds, And gay prosperity's enlivening bloom Through the mild precincts of thy happy home. Virtues like thine consume in truth's bright fire, Th' invidious slander of the Cynic lyre. And ye of the proud Sex, that shun to prove The blissful intercourse of wedded love, Whom yet, upon whose fair and manly frame No foul distortion bars your tender claim To win, with all its soft and generous fires, The heart of woman to your just desires, You, with the tetchy bard's invidious sneer, Will you asperse the sex you should revere? Resemble him, who felt each passion warm Check'd by the influence of his hapless form? Who, sore with disappointment's galling pain, Hated the sex, to which he sued in vain. Turn from the Railer!—nor, without the fate, That warpt his mind to the false bent of hate, Draw, in the causeless rage of kindred spleen, The gloomy curtains of his cold chagrin Before the purple torch, that love displays To light your steps through life's bewilder'd maze. Yes, let each liberal youth, who would not be That suicide on self-felicity, Though wisely he may shun the gaudy snare, Spread by the vain, the fashionable Fair, For winning patterns of the powers that throw, On wedded hearts, delight's unfading glow, Fond love, resisting, in a woman's breast, The stings of falsehood, and the lures of rest; Wit, brilliant wit, with soberest wisdom join'd, Each charm of temper, and each strength of mind; The first in Hogarth's melting female see, And for the last, Cornelia, study thee! EPISTLE TO Mr ROMNEY, BEING PRESENTED BY HIM WITH A PICTURE OF WILLIAM HAYLEY, ESQ. Ingenious Romney, in thy liberal heart We feel thy virtues rivals of thy art; Indulgent wilt thou then accept my lay, Though faintly gilded by poetic ray, When it would tell how much to thee I owe, That on these walls thy Hayley's features glow? Remote in studious bowers, around his head Too long false Modesty her shadows spread; But when at length upon the general sight Rose his gay Muse, array'd in classic light, Full on thy science The first of Mr Hayley's admirable Poems on the Sciences, is addressed to his friend Romney, and characterizes the great painters, ancient and modern, comparing them with the poets. her warm effluence shone, And mark'd its dear relation to her own, Painting and Poetry on one bright throne; And 'mid their mutual votaries display'd The kindred excellence that ne'er shall fade. High on the tablet, consecrate to fame, Painter belov'd, appears thy honor'd name. Reclin'd and musing on the secret shade, Oft have aerial Beings round me play'd, While Fancy, promptress of the waking dream, Bent her clear prism upon its rising theme; Blest could I catch, O Romney, as they shine, As brilliant lights, and shades as bold as thine! Ah! not for me, in such resistless blaze, Descend Poetic Fancy's plastic rays; But when their utmost force the Muse inspires, Through clearest crystal when they dart their fires, Then scenes arise, in intellectual hue, Gay, soft, and warm, as Claude or Poussin drew; Then setting sun-beams gild the lonely vale, Wet with the shower and trembling from the gale; Green circling hills imbibe them as they stream, And their moist tops are yellow in the gleam. Or sternly if she leads the mental sight Where Horror scowls, beneath incumbent night, With all Salvator's savage dignity Scowl the dark, rugged rock, and lurid sky. When Love and Beauty to her pen are given, She draws their forms in colours dipt in heaven; For Homer's leaf her hands the hues prepare, And Helen shines as Titian's Venus fair. She orient tints to Milton's page supplies, And his sweet Eve with Raphael's Mary vies, While deck'd in floating pomp the gorgeous angels rise. Or, if, obedient to her potent sway, Passions embodied move in long array; If wild Revenge fierce bound into his car, Wave the dark crest, and shake the lance of war; If Love sit melting in the azure eye, Dye the warm blush, and swell the tender sigh; Glares conscious Guilt, or trembles hurried Fear, Or if mild Pity drop the balmy tear, Poetic Fancy o'er the shape and face Breathes Michael's force, and Guido's flowing grace; Nor to one image, nor one scene confin'd, Successive pictures rise before the mind. Here Poesy o'er Painting proudly towers, Nor boasts unjustly her superior powers; Since, though to Painting's free and ardent hand, Is given to wake each form of fair and grand; To rival Nature with her vivid hues; To speak the language of the loftiest muse; Yet, to a point of time her force restrain'd, One fixed effect can only be attain'd By the slow labour of revolving days, Though Art consummate on the canvas blaze. Thus triumphs Poesy;—yet Painting knows A power more precious; on affection's woes To shed a softer, a more chearing ray, Than beams from Mason's, or from Hayley's lay. See lovely Susan on the sea-beach stands, And stretches o'er the waves her trembling hands; Upbraids the bounding ship, whose sails unfurl'd Court the dread hazards of the wat'ry world; While, ling'ring on the windy deck in vain, William's dear form gleams dimly o'er the main;— Now distance veils him on the misty deep, And slow she turns, to wander, and to weep. What, 'mid these sorrows, may her tears beguile, And wake on her pale lip the pensive smile? O Painting! great Magician! thine the power That gilds unhappy Susan's gloomy hour; Warm in thy tints, in thy expression bright, Still charming William lives before her sight; Distinct his speaking eye, his graceful brows, And all himself the idol portrait glows. Say, Poesy, can thy rich stores impart Such precious balsam to the wounded heart? What equal medicine boast thy mighty Nine, Though strains Orphean warble from their shrine? Since if the fair ideal forms we trace, Rivals of life in colour, strength, and grace, Yet, when emerging Genius charms our sight, Free as it soars Aonia's sacred height, And our pleas'd thoughts the consciousness desire Of features warm'd and beaming with its fire; Features, which to our mortal eye unknown Might to our mind by plastic art be shown, 'Tis then that Poesy, responseless found, Frowns on her pen and throws it on the ground. Though ne'er beheld the actual form he wears, My spirit thus thy Hayley's fame reveres; Marks his dear Muse her charming strains extend, And boasts the privilege to call him Friend. But when in vain my grateful wishes sought His living image in the stores of thought, Thy pencil, Romney, the desire supplies, And bids me see the generous Bard I prize. O! while in each bold lineament we find Some emanation of his ardent mind, See worth benign, and copious knowledge throw Their mingled grace upon his pensive brow, Still, glowing Artist, shall thy gift impart Unsated pleasure to my conscious heart. Dear is that gift as the soft, silver rain, And breath Favonian, to the April plain, As Memory's voice recalling happy days, As to my favour'd muse thy Hayley's praise. WRITTEN IN THE BLANK PAGE OF THE SORROWS OF WERTER. It is said, the characters of Werter, Charlotte, and Albert, the disastrous passion of the former, and the terrible event it produced, were real, together with nearly all the sentiments in Werter's letters; heightened, no doubt, in the powers of eloquence, by passing through the pen of the celebrated German novelist. There has been much ridiculous cant about the fancied immorality of these interesting volumes. The long miseries and tragic death of Werter, breathe an awful warning against imitating his error, and evince the fatal power of indulging an hopeless passion, even for a most amiable object, to blast the destiny, and to render fruitless all the virtues of a naturally generous and good young man. Absurd censurers are angry that he is not made despicable, because he was criminally indiscreet. They are incensed that his woes excite compassion. With equal justice, Othello might be deemed an immoral play, because we cannot with-hold our esteem and pity from the man, who, giving way to suspicious appearances, murders his innocent wife. Werter, by giving way to his affection for an engaged woman, though without the least design to seduce her, renders his own existence insupportable. There is no temptation to copy the conduct of either character; therefore neither the play, nor the novel, can justly be taxed with having an immoral tendency. The light of moral warning breaks out stronger, from beneath the shades in such characters, than from the unmingled brightness of those, who are represented faultless, or at least exempt from any very marked error. O thou, who turnest this impassioned leaf, Where Anguish claims the sympathetic grief, If no relentless prejudice can bind In stagnant frost the mercy of thy mind; If thou shalt guess how hard to inflict the smart Of icy absence on the glowing heart, When all that charm'd the sense, th' affection won, Dwells in that form, which prudence bids us shun; That present, soothes each rankling woe to rest, Departed, desolates the languid breast, Then thou'lt lament, amidst thy virtuous blame, The wretched victim of a baneful flame, Where ill-starr'd Love its deadliest lightning shed On the pale Suicide's devoted head, And woes, that would no holier thought allow, Threw ghastly shadows on the bleeding brow.— Still, as thou weep'st their unresisted powers, The virtues of the lost-one's happier hours Shall o'er his fatal errors gently rise, Live in thy heart, and consecrate thy sighs! And for the soft compassion thou hast shown For woes and frailties, to thy soul unknown, For generous sympathy, which shines confest, Eternal inmate of the noble breast, Ne'er may embosom'd grief thine eye-lids dim,— O! live to love, but not to mourn, like him! WRITTEN IN THE TITLE PAGE OF A VOLUME CONTAINING Mr JEPHSON's TRAGEDIES. Poetic Spirits, bend your ardent gaze On this rich effluence of dramatic rays! Than those alone less eminently bright, That dart from Shakespear's orb their solar light, Fastidious Spleen, and canker'd Envy fly, Nor thou! O mole-eyed Prejudice, be nigh! Then, nervous Jephson, shall thy muse obtain Applause, that opes the gate of Glory's fane. WRITTEN IN A DIMINUTIVE EDITION OF GRAY'S POEMS. All to the lofty Ode that genius gives Within these few and narrow pages lives; The Theban's strength, and more than Theban's grace, A lyric Universe in fairy space. VERSES WRITTEN IN THE BLANK LEAVES OF MR HAYLEY'S POEMS, PRESENTED BY A. SEWARD, TO WM, GROVE, ESQ. OF LICHFIELD, 1793. If e'er just taste, and sympathy sincere, Reader, thy breast illum'd, they kindle here, Here, at the Sun of Genius, for it shines And pours a flood of radiance through the lines. But to perceive in what degree each theme Draws life and beauty from the plastic beam; To mark how deep its sacred force pervades, Its lights how lustrous, and how soft its shades, Demands a kindred Spirit, skill'd to pierce The coyest labyrinths of Aonian verse; And Hayley's powers due praise can only gain When Poets analyze his various strain; Feel the extent of every just design, And taste the flowing sweetness of the line; The learn'd allusions mark, th' inventive art, The skill to energize and melt the heart; Through all the imagery empower'd to trace The strength impressive, and the winning grace; Behold the gay satiric verse arise From the rich source Benevolence supplies; For with her lustre, flashing from the lyre, Nor spleen, nor malice, mix their lightless fire; Since, though the pomp of letter'd Insolence, Cold-hearted Vanity, and nice Pretence, Stript of their veil, the lucid rhyme displays, Yet every virtue brightens in its rays. Ingenious Grove! thy own poetic vein, Its classic elegance, its tuneful strain, Are certain pledges, that to thee belong Powers, to appreciate well the Poet's song, And competent to breathe the just acclaim, Unerring harbinger of lasting fame. WRITTEN IN THE BLANK LEAF OF A SMALL POCKET EDITION OF THOMSON's SEASONS, THE GIFT OF MISS NOTT, OF LICHFIELD. The gilded volume, where to actual sight The sculptor's powers the poet's scenes array, And rival praise by rival grace excite, Proves not to me a source of that delight, These small unornamented leaves convey. Since they present, in an unburden'd hand, As my lone step o'er hill and valley strays, To fancy's eye, each trace of fair, or grand, Of bright, or fading, solemn, wild, or bland, The waxing, or the waning year displays. Yes, little book! like Elfin sprites of old, Thou to thy mistress shalt auspicious prove, And while thy leaves exhaustless charms unfold, More shall they please, since thee her eyes behold A welcome present from a friend they love. WITH A LOCK OF THE AUTHOR's HAIR, TO A GENTLEMAN WHO REQUESTED IT. Not with the bright, yet dangerous rose of love, By Florio's hand, be this light lock enwove, But with the lily, cull'd from Friendship's bowers, That hides no thorns beneath its snowy flowers. ON SEEING MR HAYLEY'S WORKS INVIDIOUSLY CRITICIZED IN THE PUBLIC PRINTS OF THE YEAR 1783. Rise, kindred dunces, from your drear abodes, Where Folly nurs'd you, and where Envy goads! Rise, till your growing numbers equal those That hurl'd at Pope's bright verse their murky prose! So you, at length, may raise the tardy ire By Wit and Genius arm'd with all their fire. Rise! that another Dunciad soon may save Your venom'd tribe from Lethe's whelming wave, And Hayley bear you through the walks of time, Rendering your worthless names immortal as his rhyme! VERSES TO THE CELEBRATED PAINTER, MR WRIGHT, OF DERBY, WRITTEN IN 1783. Thou, in whose breast the gentle virtues shine, Thou, at whose call th' obsequious graces bow, Fain would I, kneeling at the Muses' shrine, Gather the laurel for thy modest brow. And should in vain my feeble arm extend, In vain the meed these faltering lays demand, Should, from my touch, the conscious laurel bend, Like coy Mimosa, shrinking from the hand, Sensitive plant. Yet thy bright tablet, with unfading hues, Shall beam on high in honour's envied fane, By him emblazon'd, whose immortal muse Mr Hayley celebrated Mr Wright's talent in his first great Work, Epistles on Painting. Adorn'd thy science with her earliest strain; Brought every gem the mines of Knowledge hide, Cull'd roseate spoils from Fancy's flowery plains, And with their mingled stores new bands supplied, That bind the sister Arts in closer chains. What living lights, ingenious Artist, stream, In mingling mazes as thy pencil roves! With orient hues in bright expansion beam, Or bend the flowing curve that beauty loves! Charm'd as we mark, beneath thy magic hand, Mr Wright's Moonlight Views of Matlock.—18. His Vesuvius—18. His Virgil's tomb. What sweet repose surrounds the sombrous scene, Where, fring'd with wood, yon moon-bright cliffs expand, The curl'd waves twinkling as they wind between; Start, as on high thy red Vesuvius glares, Through Earth and Ocean pours his sanguine light, With billowy smoke obscures the rising stars, Or darts his vollied lightnings through the night; Sigh, where 'mid twilight shades, yon pile sublime, In cumbrous ruin, nods o'er Virgil's tomb, Where, nurs'd by thee, poetic ivies climb, Fresh florets spring, and brighter laurels bloom; Or weep for Julia, in her sea-girt cave, His Julia, banished to a desert island by her grandfather, Augustus, for her amours with Ovid. Exil'd from love in beauty's splendid morn, Wild as she gazes on the boundless wave, And sighs, in hopeless solitude, forlorn. Now, ardent Wright, from thy creative hand, With outline bold, and mellowest colouring warm, Rival of life, before the canvas stands My Father's lov'd and venerable form! O! when his urn shall drink my falling tears, Thy faithful tints shall shed a bless'd relief, Glow with mild lustre through my darken'd years, And gild the gathering shades of filial grief! EPISTLE TO WILLIAM HAYLEY,Esq. This poem, as far as the 64th line, was written in the chaise, returning from Coleshill to Lichfield, the author having accompanied Mr Hayley so far on his road to London in December 1781. 'Tis past!—the shades of deprivation lour, Numbing, with influence cold, the heavy hour. Thy joys, O Friendship! fly ere well begun, Like the mild shining of yon liquid sun Through this short winter's day:—and yet I hear Haylean accents vibrate on my ear; Still on that countenance I seem to gaze, Whence mingled stream the intellectual rays. But ah! the sweet ideal mockery flies, Silence and vacancy around me rise! Wrap my chill'd spirit in their icy vest, And chace each dear illusion from my breast. Haste, ye tir'd steeds, that o'er the miry way To my lone home these listless limbs convey! There Hayley's mute resemblance still remains, To sooth the absent friend's regretful pains; Yet well she knows that the repining sigh, The tear, that dims the disappointed eye, Shall prove how weak the pencil's utmost art To match the faithful tablet of the heart. But when the form, there shrin'd, too oft survey'd, Perhaps the generality of people have not sufficiently attended to the operation of their minds, respecting the personal idea they retain of the long absent, or the dead, so as clearly to comprehend the eight ensuing lines. No picture, be it ever so well painted, can vie with the memory in that exactness, with which she presents, early in absence, the image of that form and face, whose lineaments are dear to us. Therefore, actual pictures of beloved friends would not be so eagerly coveted, but that we render this darling, internal image indistinct, by recalling it too frequently; as that strength of line, which gives sharpness and spirit to a copper-plate, becomes injured after a certain number of impressions have been taken off. By repeated use, the plate, if not retouched, will produce only a dim and shadowy mass, in which the features and countenance cannot be very distinctly discerned. So it is with the memory, after continual recurrence, and pressure of the affections upon the image she presents, which, for a considerable period, she had presented with that perfect precision, to which no powers of the pencil can attain;—but, in time, the image becomes indistinct, not from any decay in the powers of memory; not from the affections growing cold, but merely from intense and incessant recurrence. Yes, it is beneath the constant glow of ardent imagination, that the impression, given by memory, has faded. Then it is that a good, nay even an indifferent picture, or a paper-profile of a dear lost friend, strengthens our recollection, in the same manner that retouching a copper-plate restores its power of giving animated impressions. The author wishes that all who peruse these remarks, and have dispositions sufficiently affectionate to contemplate fervently, and often, in their own minds the image of one, fondly beloved, whom they have, for a length of years, or for ever lost, would recollect if, after a time, they were able to recall that image with equal precision, as they could remember the features, and air, of other deceased, or absent persons, with whom they had been well acquainted, but of whom, being less interesting to their affections, they had only casually thought. The superior distinctness with which the less beloved image comes back to the mind, upon its summons, proves the philosophic truth of these remarks, and is the cause why we so fondly desire the penciled remembrance of those we love, to refresh that ideal image which intense and perpetual contemplation had rendered evanescent. Locke says—“The pictures drawn in our minds of our absent friends, are laid in fading colours, which, if not sometimes refreshed, will vanish and disappear.” It might have been expected that a philosopher so accurate and discriminating, would have pursued the observation, and reminded us, that there are two causes, exactly opposite to each other, which produce this vanishing; viz. the mind not having dwelt upon the originals of those its pictures often enough to make their image strong and vivid after long absence; —and, its too frequently casting upon such inshrined resemblances, the dazzling light of fervent meditation. It is not meant that fervent meditation will produce forgetfulness of the general idea of the persons of those we fondly regret, but that it will, in time, make us unable to recall them with that precision we desire, without the help of the pencil. Beneath the ardent beam of Thought shall fade, For the mark'd lines that Memory's tints display In contemplation's fire will melt away, Then, Romney The celebrated painter., nor till then, my soul shall own Thy perfect skill, and each regret atone, For more than mortal art no longer pine, And cease to boast superior power to thine. And now, illumined by the crystal rays, Fair spires, again ye meet my wonted gaze! Your forms majestic, in the fleecy skies, As conscious of recorded honours, rise; Shield for your Bards, and Chiefs Alluding to the tradition of a battle fought in the time of the Romans, and to the remains of the warriors' tombs on the scene of action, Berocop Hill, near the city., of former days, The warrior-laurel, and the classic bays. Chiefs, o'er whose sunk, sepulchral, mossy stone, The suns and storms of countless years have flown; And they, of later times, who wing'd afar Lichfield stood a siege by Cromwell's army, in the civil war of that period. From your high towers, the volleying bolts of war. For that fam'd Pair —Johnson and Garrick were both edueated at Lichfield, under the author's maternal grandfather, the Rev. John Hunter, Prebendary of the Cathedral, and Master of the Free-School., in youth's delightful spring, Pluming beneath your shade their eaglet wing, What time, to fire each passion of the heart, Ye saw young Garrick form his matchless art, Your stripling Johnson, build the lofty rhyme, Or ruminate the moral thought sublime. And late ye saw, at evening's solemn hours, —It was Mr Hayley's custom, during his fortnight's residence at Lichfield, to walk in the side aisles of the Cathedral during choir-service at evening prayers, which are always performed by candle-light in winter. The arches of those aisles were then open at top into the choir. When the church was altered, in the year 1788, the arches were closed up, which prevents all the fine effect of dubious light and shadow, described in the ensuing lines. On week days the choir is but imperfectly illuminated. As sigh'd the winter-blast amid your towers, Britain's distinguish'd Bard beneath you stray, And bend through your long aisles his musing way; Observe the gleams, from your half-lighted choir, Throw the long levell'd line of paly fire High o'er the darksome arch, and awful spread Ambiguous glimmer round his pensive head; While the faint rays o'er distant objects wave, That seem the sombre spectres of the grave. O! will that honour'd Bard, in future time, Remember her, who view'd the thought sublime, Enthron'd majestic in his earnest eye, Slow as the gloomy figures glided by? With one kind sigh will his great soul repay Pledg'd hours Unforeseen business obliged Mr Hayley to abridge his purposed visit to Mr Seward and his daughter.of letter'd joys his flight has borne away? And now again this roof, so lately blest, Receives me musing on its transient guest. Slow as my step, with joyless thought, I turn, The known apartments seek, and entering mourn, Instant each object to my sense recalls The Friend, so widely wandering from these walls. Though the mild sun, in this hybernal hour, Turns his gold eye on yonder moss-grown tower, Stow church stands in the little rural valley, overlooked by the east front of the Bishop's palace, the residence of Mr Seward and his family. Yet the lone graces of the quiet scene, The vale, still grassy, and the lake serene, Distinct and clear present themselves in vain; Dim, as the sailing cloud, surcharg'd with rain, My swimming eyes have drawn the misty veil, O'er sunny tower, blue lake, and grassy dale; For through the walls a sullen silence reigns, So late resounding with delightful strains; Accents that Friendship's hallow'd powers inspire, Aonian lays, and more than attic fire. And now the clamorous bell's unwelcome peal Calls me, reluctant, to the cheerless meal; No bounding step along the hall I hear, But turn my head, and hide the starting tear. High-soul'd attachment, by thy powerful sway, Of deep regrets how large a sum we pay For joys, that triumph in their proud increase, And rashly pass the level line of Peace! Milton, in the close of his sonnet to Mr Laurence, insinuates that there is danger in too frequently indulging the luxury of intellectual society, thus— What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice, Of attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise To hear the lute well touch'd, and artful voice Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air? He, who of these delights can judge, and spare To interpose them oft, is not unwise. TO THE MEMORY OF LADY MILLAR. The late lady Millar, of Bath-Easton, near Bath, held an assembly at that elegant villa, once a fortnight during the Bath season. She rendered this meeting a poetical institution, giving out subjects at each assembly for poems to be read at the ensuing one. The verses were deposited in an antique Etruscan vase, and were drawn out by gentlemen appointed to read them aloud, and to judge of their rival merits. These gentlemen, ignorant of the authors, selected three poems from the collection which they thought most worthy of the three myrtle wreaths, decreed as the rewards and honours of the day. The names of the persons who had obtained the prizes were then announced by lady Millar. Once a year the most ingenious of these productions were published. Four volumes have already appeared, and the profits been applied to the benefit of a charity at Bath; so that lady Millar's institution was not only calculated to awaken and cultivate ingenuity, but to serve the purposes of benevolence and charity. It had continued about six years, and ceased with the death of its amiable patroness.— That event happened in July, 1781. Not to your shades alone, ye martial Dead, The scatter'd flow'rs of plaintive rhyme belong, Tho' Valour, marching round your grave, may shed The richest seeds of elegiac song; Tho' Fame's proud chissel o'er your trophied tomb Hangs the bright falchion high, and bends the warrior-plume. When Death with silent footstep prints the plain, And spreads o'er female worth his sable pall, Shall Poesy renounce the mournful train, Shall her melodious tears refuse to fall, Where Friendship's sighs, where Love's deep groans invite, And Virtue calls aloud to aid the solemn rite? Ye, who essay'd to weave the golden thread, And gem with flow'rs the woof of high applause, The pious veil o'er shroudless Andre spread, O'er Ander, murder'd in his country's cause; Ye, who with foliage dun and plumage grey, Rear'd high the sacred shade that wav'd o'er Cook's Morai; Ye Sister Nine, that weep departed worth, Pour from your echoing strings the soothing lay, Chaunt the slow requiem o'er this hallow'd earth, That hides your Laura's life-deserted clay; Hides the coldheart, which glow'd with all your fires, The hand, that deck'd with wreaths your manychorded lyres. Oft have ye seen her, in her classic bow'rs, Weave the rich myrtle round the early rose; And grace with dearer joy the festive hours Than vain parade, or idle mirth bestows; While from her glance benign young Genius caught Spirit to ope fresh mines of soul-exalting thought. And sure, o'er polished circles to diffuse The new ambition, virtuous and refin'd, To the light Graces lead the loftier muse, And their twin'd hands with rosy chaplets bind, Not less deserves the meed of tuneful praise, Than Valour his proud wreath, than Wit his deathless bays. To her gay dome, that decks the breezy vale, Enlighten'd Pleasure led a jocund crew, And youths and virgins in the vernal gale, With eager step to her chaste revel flew; While to the inspiring God, that gilds the day, Pure the devotion rose in many a glowing lay. Propitious heard the Pow'r, and gaily beam'd, Gilding the foliage of the verdant shrine; And bending o'er her vase, fair Laura seem'd The smiling Priestess of the sacred Nine, As her green wreath she wove, to grace the Bard, Whose sweet superior song might claim the wish'd reward. But now, disastrous change!—alas! no more Her gentle looks, and dulcet voice invite The willing train their festive songs to pour, And wing the passing moments with delight; O'er the lone vase, e'erwhile so gaily crown'd, A dim hand draws the veil of sable lawn around; And to her shade the mingled dirge of woe An elegy to the memory of lady Millar, set to music for three voices, by Dr Harrington, of Bath. Ascends from Harrington's harmonious hand; The plaintive sounds with varied sweetness flow, And through the scenes that feel her loss expand; His melting notes impress with magic art Her recollected worth on ev'ry generous heart. Benignant Laura! to the Muses dear, Thy virtuous mind with bright ambition glow'd, To tune the lyre, the votive shrine to rear, By Science hallow'd in their fair abode; From sterling wit to clear each base alloy, And fill with purest fires the crystal lamp of joy. With high-soul'd pleasure, and ingenuous truth, 'Twas thine to nurse the hopes of young Renown; 'Twas thine to elevate the views of youth; To look, with calm disdain, superior down On Pride's cold frown, and Fashion's pointed leer; On Envy's serpent lie, and Folly's apish sneer. Wide through the murky shades, by Malice shed, To shroud its blossoms, and its foliage blight, With rising strength thy verdant altar spread, And bards of loftiest spirit join'd its rite; And with their oaken, and their laurel crown Inwove thy myrtle buds, fair wreath of fair Renown! Though all unknown to Fame its artless reed, My trembling hand, at thy kind bidding, tried To crop the blossoms of the uncultur'd mead, The primrose pale, the briar's blushing pride, And on thy vase with true devotion laid The tributary flow'rs—too soon, alas! to fade. Safe through thy gentle ordeal's lambent flame, My Muse, aspiring, dar'd the fiercer blaze, The Reviewers.

Dear to the parent-source from whence I drew The spark of life, and all that life endears, Time-honour'd Graves! Rev.

There tender Whalley Rev Mr Whalley, of Langford Court, near Bristol, author of that interesting love poem, Edwy and Edilda. struck his silver lyre To Love and Nature strung,—as mingled flows With elegiac sweetness epic fire, In the soft story of his Edwy's woes; Its beauteous page shall prompt, through distant years, The thrill of generous joy, the tide of pitying tears.

Anstey himself would join the sportive band, Anstey, enlivener of the serious earth! At the light waving of whose magic wand, New fountains rose, and flow with endless mirth; Pouring on Fancy's soul a glow as warm, As Bath's rich springs impart to Health's reviving form. Immortal Truth, for his salubrious song, Pluck'd the unfading laurel from her fane; Since oft, amid the laugh of Momus' throng, Wisdom has gravely smil'd, and prais'd the strain; Pleas'd to behold the Fools of Fashion hit By new, unrival'd shafts of ridicule and wit. Bright glows the list with many an honour'd name, Whom Taste in Laura's votive throng surveys; But Hayley flashes in a type of flame, Trac'd by a sun-beam the broad letters blaze! Rapt Britain reads the long-recording fire, Claps her triumphant hands, and bids her realms admire! While check'd by gen'rous friendship's modest frown, That will not hear the praise it joys to give; My fingers quit the chords of high renown, On which his young, but deathless glories live; Yet with these lays one grateful wish shall blend, And on Devotion's wing to list'ning Heaven ascend. Through lengthen'd years that pass, and passing shine, While Health and Joy on their bright moments wait, May his pure mind, with all its warmth benign, Set late and cloudless in the depths of fate; Not early, like fair Laura's spirit, fly From this dark earthly scene, to its congenial sky! Stay the white radiance of thy silver car O'er Laura's hallow'd turf, fair Queen of Night, And from the orbit of thy herald-star, Feed all its pensive flow'rs with dewy light! For so her gentle spirit oft' would shed Soft Pity's light and dews on Pain's deserted head. When Fashion o'er her threw the shining vest, When Pleasure round her trill'd the Syren song, The sighs of Pity swell'd her polish'd breast, The tones of Mercy warbled from her tongue; She bade the fires of classic lore pervade With charity's kind warmth Lady Millar's poetic institution was also a charitable one. misfortune's barren shade. Not in the wealth of Andes' glitt'ring mines, Not in the charms the zone of love bestows, The female form so exquisitely shines, Though Empire binds the circlet on her brows, As when compassion sheds her lustre meek, Swims in the moistened eye, and wets the glowing cheek. O witness thou, so eminently good, That in the regal robe, and beauty's pride, At Calais' conquer'd gate, sweet smiling stood, By thy victorious Edward's awful side! In martial ire War's sable cloud he seem'd, And thou the radiant bow, that o'er its darkness beam'd. Boast of thy sex, and glory of the throne! O'er all thy form what matchless graces spread, When thy fair eyes in moist suffusion shone, And from thy cheek the changing crimson fled, As on the neck of Edward's captive foes To thy afflicted sight the opprobrious cord arose! Oh! while the fair, with soul-subduing pow'r, On her bent knee their forfeit lives implor'd; When, like two stars seen through a rushing show'r, Her watry eyes gaz'd earnest on her lord, 'Twas then thy virtues, loveliest queen, outshone Thy Edward's victor-plume, waving o'er Gallia's throne! Thus while with fervent zeal the auspicious Nine O'er Laura's form the classic cestus threw, Hung all their golden harps within her shrine, And ting'd her wreaths with undecaying hue, Yet, Charity, thy soft seraphic flame A purer glory shed around her spotless name. And harmonizing sweet with Friendship's lyre The grateful blessings of the poor shall blend, And borne on angel-wings to Heaven's full choir, Sublime the breath of Gratitude ascend; With strains more dulcet swell the aspiring gales, Than rise from Pindus' grove, than float in Thespian vales. Nor yet that worth, which shunn'd the public view, Wilt thou, O mournful muse! refuse to sing; Each virtue rather to its shade pursue, And stoop from shining heights thy trembling wing; Teach the soft sex whence genuine transport flows, Tell them, domestic joy the fullest bliss bestows. This beauteous lesson may they wisely read In the white page of Laura's vital state; And emulate each great, each gentle deed, That crown'd her fame, or that disarm'd her fate; For sky-rob'd Innocence can smiling brave The dart of instant death, and triumph o'er the grave. O, born to smooth the rugged path of life, For all who trod with thee its mazy round! Where neither gloomy Care, nor noisy Strife, Dark Spleen or haggard Jealousy were found; For Chearfulness and Love, with potent sway, The Lares of thy hearth, chas'd ev'ry Fiend away. Since well thou knew'st, nor pomp nor festal show, In the gay revel of their gorgeous night, On youth's warm breast could breathe so pure a glow, As sweet domestic comfort's cheering light; For soft she sheds, on halcyon pinions borne, Her poppies o'er the night, her roses on the morn. In dissipation's giddy circle whirl'd, One joy sincere can erring Beauty prove, A rake's loose homage or a flatt'ring world, Supply the sweetness of connubial love; Where fix'd esteem shall lasting joy inspire, And blend the husband's faith with all the lover's fire? Nor less that bliss the virtuous bosom knows Whilst its fond care a parent's woe beguiles; When life's pale winter, with the filial rose Adorn'd and happy, still serenely smiles; Lulls the chill gale of each repining sigh, And basks in joy's warm gleam when the lov'd child is nigh. Thus duteous Laura hung, with vestal care, O'er the dim trembling light of waning age; The waste of time and sickness to repair, And steal attention from each dark presage; Discharging thus affection's vast arrears Of countless debts incurr'd through childhood's helpless years. And thus her infants, in a distant hour, With fairest worth parental hopes had blest; Strew'd her declining path with ev'ry flow'r, Her fost'ring hand had planted in their breast; But ah! that hand is cold! and points no more The surest path of peace, on virtue's sacred shore! Ye lovely innocents, whose loss severe The Muse with tender sympathy surveys, If such memorials as her love can rear, May catch, in future years, your filial gaze, Here shall your parent's pure emblazon'd name, Light you to fairest deeds by emulation's flame! Yet must this verse thy kind indulgence crave, Thou, who wilt most perceive its failing art; Who view'st, slow wand'ring round thy Laura's grave, Her juster image in thy widow'd heart; For the fond wish to bid her merits live, Forgive the fainter tints, the erring line forgive! O faithful Memory! may thy lamp illume Her honour'd sepulchre with radiance clear; Connubial love shall rest upon her tomb, And infant duty shed its April tear; There, with veil'd brows, parental fondness mourn, Bend o'er the holy earth, and consecrate her urn! EPISTLE TO THE REV. DR WILLIAM BAGSHOT STEVENS, OF REPTON, DERBYSHIRE, WRITTEN IN 1783. If yet, unbless'd with learning's guardian aids, I rov'd the labyrinths of Aonian shades, And in the gloomy and the silent hour Wove the dun foliage of their cypress bower, The oak-crown'd Chief, and laurel'd Warrior's tomb Elegy on captain Cook—Monody on major Andre. Solemn to strew;—and cropt their floral bloom For a fair votary's urn, my priz'd reward Monody on lady Miller. Lives in the smile of Repton's classic Bard. Yet not the letter'd smile's inspiring ray, When most its warmth shall gild my pensive lay, Such intellectual luxury can impart, Or pour such sweet sensations on my heart, As when, ingenious Lyrist, brightly shine Through the clear medium of thy classic line, Alluding to the Retirement, published by Mr Stevens, in 1782, the first of a small, but beautiful collection of poems, printed for Ab. Portal of the Strand; Faulder, of New Bond-street; and Kearsley, No. 46, Fleet-street. This work went through two editions, though it met the utmost injustice that dullness and spleen could produce, in one of the leading Reviewers. No compositions, especially those of so young a man, are without imperfections. The few defects of Retirement were assiduously pointed out, and exaggerated, and many unexceptionable lines and expressions clumsily ridiculed; while the numerous passages of striking and unborrowed beauty, were passed over in silence; but the Gentleman's Magazine did more justice to those excellencies, which must impress and delight every reader, who possesses any portion of poetic taste. On every hill, and vale, and plain, and grove, The seraph forms of Beauty, Truth, and Love. Sing on, sweet Bard! for to thy happy lyre, When beams the setting sun with chasten'd fire, And evening clouds, half pierc'd with light, have spread Their floating purple round his golden head, High o'er their edge, as soft they sail along, Shall bend the spirits of congenial song; Thomson, great Nature's darling votary, bow The leafy honours of his placid brow, And lofty Akenside shall hail the strains That Beauty decks, and Energy sustains. Sing on, sweet Bard! when spring's gay warblers cease To celebrate the jocund year's increase, And summer must no more his thirst subdue In the expanding rose-bud's lucid dew; But, with their fading hues, and closing bells, The pale, shrunk flowers shall strew the whiten'd dells, And autumn's lingering steps, retreating, press Their fallen petals down the lone recess, Still may thy song, to every rising gale, Sigh through the dim and melancholy vale; And when the aerial archer, as he flies, Wings the red arrow through the gloomy skies, And furious Trent, high o'er his banks shall pour The turbid waters round thy favourite bower, Ceaseless do thou the rising strain prolong, And hail stern winter with thy solemn song! While for the lyre, that erst to the soft days Of bloomy summer breath'd the lovely lays, On thy nerv'd arm the Eolian shell be slung, Full to the tempest's angry wailing flung; And he, whose strains, on cold Temora's hill, Mourn'd o'er the eddies of the darken'd rill, The fame resounding of the fallen brave, O'er Erin's heath, and Ullin's stormy wave, He, on his thin, grey mist descending slow, Shrill as the frequent blast is heard to blow, 'Mid the lone rocks thy wandering steps shall find, And lift thy harp to winter's loudest wind. O! when its tones fall murmuring on the floods, Deeply respondent to the groaning woods, Each lofty note, that hymns the rifled year, With force impressive shall assail the ear, As when thou call'st the shuddering thoughts to mourn O'er talents wither'd Referring to Mr Stevens' beautiful descriptions in his poem, Retirement, of the hard fate of those great poets, Spencer, Milton, Otway, Collins, and Chatterton, each of whom struggled with the evils of neglect and poverty; and all, except Milton, became their victims. I am tempted to instance here the passages which relate to Collins and Chatterton, to prove that in praising the genius of Mr Stevens, I have not been influenced by partiality. Collins—quoted from Retirement. “But who is he whom later garlands grace? “Lo! his worn youth, beneath the chilling grasp “Of penury, faints; and in her mournful shroud, “Darkening all joy, all promises of bliss, “All health, all hope, dire melancholy saps, “In drear decay, the fabric of his mind! “See shuddering Pity, o'er his fallen soul “Wring her pale hands!—Regardless of the guide “That lifts his steps, regardless of the friend “That mourns, nor sadly conscious of himself, “Silent, yet wild, his languid spirit lies! “The light of thought has wander'd from his eye, “It glares, but sees not!—yet this breathing corse, “This youthful driv'ller, Nature's ghastliest form,— “O! who would love the lyre!—in all the courts “Of fancy, where abstracted beauty play'd “With wildest elegance, his ardent shell “Enamour'd struck, and charm'd the various soul. Chatterton—quoted from Retirement. “See later yet, and yet in drearier state, “Where dawning Genius, struggling into day, “Sinks in a dark eclipse!—No friendly heart, “With love propitious, and no angel-hand “With prosperous spell his labouring sun relieve, “And chace the gather'd clouds that drop with blood! in the untimely urn; To grieve that Penury's resistless storm Beat cold and deadly o'er the shrinking form, Where mighty Genius had those powers enshrin'd, Whose reign is boundless o'er each feeling mind; To mourn that anguish durst the heart invade Beneath the regal purple's awful shade, That, steep'd in blood, at the fanatic frown, From Charles' pale brows should fall the thorny crown; Charles the First—quoted from Retibement. —“in mockery see, “O'er royal sorrow sits, in stern array, “The traitrous judgment! In the eye of Heaven “O'er his meek brow dishonourable death “Unwinds her sable flag. Elizabeth—from the same Poem. See in Hume's History, the death of that Queen. “O mark, where Gloriana lies!—behold! “On the cold pavement for the jewell'd throne! “Mark, as the soothing friend, or to her ear, “In wily humour creeping, the base speech “Of adulation breathes!—Dread sovereign queen! “Imperial Mistress! Arbitress of Earth! “Mark, if the Goddess, at the alluring sound, “Unveil her sorrowing eye!—Mark if the pride “Of empire, glistening on her crown, adorn “Her brow's wan horror!—if a nation's prayer “Gladden her heart!—Stern at her bosom hang, “Bath'd in her blood, and twisted with the strings “Of life, the inexorable Fiends of Woe! That England's virgin majesty should close A long illustrious life in bitterest woes; She, who, in wisdom firm, as vast in power, On grateful millions shed the prosperous hour. O! how unlike those councils dark, that hurl'd The torch of Discord o'er the western world! This poem was written in retropection of that fatal American war, which dismembered the British Empire. Whatever ills may to the past succeed, Though lust of war may doom a world to bleed, And bleed in vain, yet may no public gloom Nor private sorrow, blight thy classic bloom! And to the Sons of Genius, whose sad fate Thy mournful lines, with sacred force, relate, O! may thy fortunes no resemblance bear, Yet may thy rising fame their deathless laurels share! TO WILLIAM HAYLEY, Esq. ON LEAVING EARTHAM, HIS SEAT IN SUSSEX, SEPT, 1782. To-morrow's dawn must bring the unwelcome hour, When my reluctant spirit's kind farewell Shall mourn in sighs, through Eartham's beauteous bower, The vanish'd pleasures of the sylvan cell. The clouds of future torpid days to chace, On its dear scenes the tender thought shall dwell, And Memory restore each lovely grace, That decks their radiant hill, and dusky dell. The full luxuriance of yon sloping wood, Circling the golden field with pomp of shade, And, where mild Comfort's downy pinions spread, The village, bosom'd in the leafy glade. The path-way fence, with shrubs and florets strewn, Soft as it winds the bright mount's steepy side; While, on th' opposing hill, dark forests frown On the noon's glory, in their sombrous pride. Green as the livelier eminence ascends, The champaign splendours bursting on the sight, Where far and wide the dazzling vale extends, Clos'd by the distant main, that rolls in light! Groves half as beauteous may delight these eyes, Thy bowers, gay Lichfield, lovely scenes afford; But ah! what keen regrets must wake my sighs, To miss the pleasures of the Haylean board! Where, as his pencil, Romney's The celebrated Mr Romney was then on a visit to Eartham. Glows with bold traits, original and strong, While Heron's Miss Heron, of Portsmouth. lays diffuse each tuneful charm; Eliza's Mrs Hayley. wit enchants, and melting song. But thou, dear Bard, our master-spring of joy, How shall I breathe to thee the sad farewell? Yet long thy kindness, grateful shall employ The mind it gladden'd in thy sylvan cell. ADDRESS TO THE SUN. WRITTEN IN A CHAISE, RETURNING OUT OF SUSSEX, SEPT. 15, AFIER A SIX WEEKS RESIDENCE AT MR HAYLEY'S SEAT, IN THAT COUNTY, 1782. Bright God of Day, whose long-enshrouded beams The almost incessant stormy weather of July and August, in the summer 1782, will not be forgotten. Now dart refulgent on the glancing streams, Since thou did'st suffer, through the months that claim The boon consummate of thy cloudless flame, Dim Auster still, in dank, and dropping groves, To breathe the sullen strain that Winter loves, Why now invest, with all thy pomp of light, The tardy morning, and the hast'ning night? But soon shall this late, gaudy race be run, Soon shall thy steeds our chill horizon shun; Their labouring way through billowy ether gain, While the pale ice-drop trembles on their mane. Not with such transient fires, and slack'ning pace, May thy own Hayley own his mortal race! Be life for him one lengthen'd summer day, With fame, health, friendship, love, and pleasure gay; O! be it long are wintry powers assail, Spread the dull cloud, or wake the stormy gale! Intrusive Sun!—more dazzling splendours play On these moist eyes, with uncongenial ray; Unwished, unwelcome, in these vacant hours, Through which affection droops, and fancy lours; Send, as they seek a less inspiring sky, The gaze reverted, and the straining eye To wood-crown'd Sussex, in whose bright domain, The Muses on their new Parnassus reign. But now, O Sun! from yonder western hill, Thy glories soften on the gilded rill; Yet, since the ruthless hand of distance spreads To my reverted gaze, her waste of meads; Rears barrier mountains, ting'd with thy last ray, Ah! what shall cheer the long ensuing way? Lone deprivation breathes respondent sighs, The gilded stream grows pale, and Eve's chill gales arise. ADDRESS TO WOMAN. FROM THE ITALIAN. Designed for peace, and soft delight, For tender love, and pity mild, O seek not thou the craggy height, The howling main, the desert wild! S ay in the shelter'd valley low, Where calmly blows the fragrant air, But shun the mountain's stormy brow, For darken'd winds are raging there. The ruffian Man endures the strife Of tempests fierce, and furious seas; Ah! better guard thy transient life, Woman, thou rosy child of ease! Rash Man, for glory's fading wreath, Provokes his early, timeless doom, Seeks every varied form of death, And desperate hastens to the tomb; But thou, O Gentlest! what can rend, With cruel grief, thy panting heart? Nor Heaven, nor Man, dost thou offend, Indeed! what never? The Italian poet flatters a little, it must be granted—his translator owns it— nor will the lordly sex assert that female woes are always imaginary. What fancied woes can dread impart? Ah! surely, on thy primal day, Great Nature smil'd in kindest mood, Suspended held the bloody fray, And hush'd the wind, and smooth'd the flood! While Man, who lives a life of pain, Was with a soul vindictive born, Loud winds blew round him, and the rain Beat furious on his wintry morn. But thou, beneath a vernal sky, What distant tempest wakes thy fears? Why does that soft, that trembling eye Gleam through a crystal film of tears? Stay in the vale;—no wild affright Shall cross thy path, nor sullen care But go not to the craggy height, The dark, loud winds are raging there! VERSES TO THE Rev. WILLIAM MASON, ON HIS SILENCE RESPECTING DR JOHNSON'S UNJUST CRITICISMS UPON MR GRAY'S WORKS, IN THE LIVES OF THE POETS.—WRITTEN IN 1782. These verses were published in one of the Gentlemen's Magazines, in 1783. Long have I seen the injured muse of Gray, Angry and mournful, before Mason stand, With asking eyes, that flash'd th' indignant ray, A pen extending, with impatient hand. I hear her awful voice reproach the bard, That rude malicious hands, permitted, tear From her fair brows, the wreath 'twas his to guard With gratitude, and friendship's sacred care. That unrepell'd the brazen faulchion flies, Whose blade is steep'd in Envy's venom'd dews, From that Philistine critic, who defies The chosen armies of the heavenly muse. Blush, Loiterer, blush, that from thine able arm Truth's victor pebbles were not slung ere now, The Giant's vaunting prowess to disarm, And sink, deep buried in his haughty brow! Mason, canst thou the vulture-talons spy, Mark the dead eagle's noble bosom gor'd, That taught thy muse to build her aerie high, And on whose guardian wing aloft she soar'd,— To glory soar'd, in sun-bright fields of fame! O! canst thou mark, and let illiberal dread Unnerve thy arm, and quench thy spirit's flame? Then shall ingratitude her mildew shed, And stain thy garlands, to remotest years, With the disgraceful spots of cold and selfish fears. EPITAPHS. ON HANNAH ROBINSON, OF LICHFIELD, ADDRESSED TO HER HUSBAND, THE REV R. G. ROBINSON. Ere ten shor months have ran their swift career, Three lovely sisters press the untimely bier! Last of the fallen blossoms! griev'd I pay, At thy pure shrine, this tributary lay. If ever dwelt with mortal woman's mind Angelic worth, from sin's dark stains refin'd, O gentle Hannah! in thy beauteous frame From Heaven to Earth the soft perfection came. Unhappy Husband, who art doom'd to mourn The lamp of joy extinguish'd in her urn, May thy torn breast congenial meekness prove, O, live to emulate thy sainted love! So shalt thou, passing a few destin'd years, With pious hope illume thy falling tears, And when thy clay this sacred dust shall join, Be ever hers who transiently was thine. ON LADY MILLER INSCRIBED ON HER MONUMENT IN THE ABBEY CHURCH, BATH. Once, in this now cold breast, those virtues shone, Which tender thought, and lasting record claim; Then, 'mid the wrecks of time, devoted stone, Uninjur'd bear thy Miller's spotless name! When clos'd the numerous eyes, that round her bier Have wept the loss of wide-extended worth, O, gentle Stranger! may one generous tear Drop, as thou bendest o'er this hallow'd earth! Are truth, and science, love, and pity thine, With liberal charity and faith sincere? Then rest thy wandering step beneath this shrine, And greet a kindred Spirit hovering near! ON ELIZA JONES, WIFE OF THE REVEREND JOHN JONES. O, pure of spirit! that hast soar'd away To thy congenial realms of cloudless day, Eliza, Angel! wilt thou hover near, And teach his soul thy wounding loss to bear, Sorrowing who saw thy cypress garland wove, Ere time had dimm'd one hue of life, or love? Then o'er the darkness, gather'd round his head, Thy guardian care the light of hope will shed, Shewing the harbour bright, religion forms For the heart wreck'd by griefs o'er-whelming storms. So shall that heart, from fruitless anguish free, Teach thy lov'd children to resemble thee; And when, in future years, they pious turn The moistened eye of duty on this urn, Here shall its consecrated tablet prove Their Mother's virtue, and their Father's love. ON MISS ANNE LAWLEY, DAUGHTER OF SIR ROBERT LAWLEY, OB. 1790. ÆTAT. 11. Sweet transient Object of incessant cares, Snatch'd from thy parents' hopes, and fears, and prayers, Let them, reflecting on life's thorny ways, Change groans of anguish to submissive praise, That thy much favour'd, and yet spotless soul, Thus early reaches the triumphant goal; Obtains the prize at the appointed place, Without the toil and danger of the race! ON DAVID GARRICK, Esq. This epitaph on Mr Garrick was requested and written in the year 1792, for his monument in Lichfield Cathedral, but not used, the sculptor not having left a space large enough for its insertion. While on this marble bends thy pensive eye, Here, Stranger, breathe the tributary sigh! Beneath these groves their Garrick nurs'd the art, That reign'd resistless o'er each feeling heart; And here those virtues dawn'd, whose power benign Bids Faith, for him, celestial palms entwine. Oft had his bounty, with pervading ray, Chas'd the dark clouds from want's tempestuous day, And oft his silence, generous as his aid, Hid from the world the noblest part he play'd. ON MRS BENNET, This lady had a personal friendship with Richardson, the well-known author of Clarissa Harlowe, &amp;c. which, beginning in her youth, continued till his death. Her destiny was uncommon as her merit. Deserted by her husband before she was sixteen, she knew not, through the remainder of her days, whether she was a wife, or widow. She had to struggle with the mortifications of dependence, and a narrow fortune, considering her birth and education. When, in declining life, the latter was augmented from fifty to eighty pounds per ann. she spared twenty annually to the distressed daughter of a deceased gentleman, who during his life had been a generous and protecting friend to herself. OB. SEPTEMBER 1792, ÆTAT. 73. The pale cold form these gates of death inclose, When warm with life, the gem of women rose. Immortal Richardson, through many a year, Watch'd her pure soul along its bright career, Saw it arise, collected, and sedate, O'er the oppressive gloom of wayward fate. Her friendship taught his eagle-glance to find Each perfect model rising in her mind, When female virtues from his hallow'd page In cloudless glory school'd a thoughtless age. Bennet, tho' set thy earthly sun, whose ray Pour'd all the fires of intellectual day, Yet its sunk orb on every heart has spread, That living honour'd, and that mourn'd thee dead, A glow celestial, potent to illume The mists of grief, the shadows of the tomb. ON ELIZA WHATELEY, WHO DIED MAY 1793, AGED NINE YEARS. Mild as the dew, that cheers the drooping flowers, Bright as its drops, Eliza's infant hours. Ah! scarce less transiently their influence given, They shone, but soon exhaling, rose to Heaven. Ye dawning talents, virtues soft and kind, That lighted and adorn'd her opening mind, Ye leave her parents' wounded hearts to mourn Their hopes, their comforts, perish'd in her urn. Religion, harbinger of endless life, Calm thou their sorrow's unavailing strife, And, with blest hope that they shall meet her there, Gild the short hours of lone privation here! ON ELIZABETH, WIFE OF J. B. SIMPSON, ESQ. OF BABWORTH, IN YORKSHIRE. She was celebrated for her skill in Painting and Music. Though breathing tints, wak'd by this now cold hand, To widow'd love's admiring gaze remain, No more Eliza's melting tones expand, Till choiring with the seraph's kindred strain. Yet, while the mourner wails his years forlorn, In floods of anguish, o'er her early doom, Sky-towering Hope, on Faith's strong pinion borne, Bursts the dark portals of the ruthless tomb. ON ELIZABETH, WIFE OF THE REV. MICHAEL BAXTER, OF TAMWORTH. In the dire list of agonizing woes, Severest grief the human bosom knows, Is the fond husband's lot, ordain'd to lead His infants round their mother's clay-cold bed. Youth, beauty, virtue, modesty's mild grace, Charms of the mind irradiating the face, Could they, Eliza, have revers'd thy doom, Love had not quench'd his torch upon thy tomb. Too early Angel! be thy bliss the balm This wound to heal, these rebel griefs to calm, Till the resigning heart shall cease to mourn A blighted lily, and a timeless urn! ON THE HON. HENRIETTA BAGOT, OB. JAN. 13, 1797, AGED 16. Ye, who in sprightly health, and strength, and bloom, By choice, or chance, view Henrietta's tomb, Of vanish'd virtues while you mourn the fate, Ponder the warning of this early date! Her mortal lot, in youth, in beauty's prime, What was,—what is,—think!—and redeem the time! Gay converse!—facile smiles!—Hope's rising light!— Eternal silence!—and a mornless night!— O! late the solace of thy parents' eyes, Balm of their rest, and day-star of their joys! Sunk from this orb of error, loss, and woe, Risen 'mid the spheres that change, nor sorrow know, If grief, if faith, bend mutual o'er thy shrine, The pang is human—but the trust divine. ON MISS WINGFIELD, of SHREWSBURY, OB. DECEMBER 1797, ÆT. 25. O! perish'd flower!—O! early darken'd day! Deplor'd eclipse of youth's meridian ray! Maria, she who mourns thy wither'd bloom, And weaves her cypress garland o'er thy tomb, Well knew the worth this now cold form enshrin'd, Pure in the last recesses of the mind; Each shaded excellence, that shunn'd the crowd, Devote to Friendship, Wisdom, and to God. Spirit benign, implore, from Mercy's Throne, Meekness resign'd and holy as thine own, To sooth their bosoms, whose parental woe They, who have lost an Angel, only know, And wake consoling thoughts of that blest clime, Where smiles eternal shame the tears of time. INSCRIBED ON THE MONUMENT OF THE Rev. WILLIAM BAGSHOT STEVENS, IN REPTON CHURCH. HE DIED 1800. Reader, if thee each sacred worth inspire, The Patriot's ardour, and the Poet's fire; Unsullied honour, friendship's generous glow, Sky-pointing hope, that smiles on finite woe Such Stevens was, and thy congenial tear Drops on the Scholar,—Bard,—and Christian's bier. FOR A MARBLE TABLET IN LICHFIELD CATHEDRATA SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN SA VILLE, FORTY-EIGHT YEARS VICAR-CHORAL OF THAT PLACE, DIED AUGUST 2,1803, AGED 67. Once in the heart, cold in yon narrow cell, Did each mild grace, each ardent virtue dwell; Kind aid, kind tears, for others' want and woe, For others' joy, the gratulating glow; And skill to mark, and eloquence to claim For genius in each art, the palm of fame. Ye choral walls, ye lost the matchless song When the last silence stiffen'd on that tongue. Ah! who may now your pealing anthems raise In soul-pour'd tones of fervent pray'r and praise? Saville, thy lips, twice on thy final day, Here breath'd, in health and hope, the sacred lay. Short pangs, ere night, their fatal signal gave, Quench'd the bright Sun for thee—and op'd the grave! Now, from that once fair form This epithet alludes to proportion rather than colour. and beaming face, Insatiate worms the lingering likeness chase; But thy pure spirit fled from pains and fears, To sinless,—changeless,—everlasting spheres. Sleep then, pale, mortal frame, in yon low shrine, “Till angels wake thee with a note like thine!” ON GENERAL SIMCOE. To deck lamented Simcoe's hallow'd tomb, Bid all thy laurels, sacred Honour, bloom! Depriv'd Britannia, o'er thy warrior's bier Veil the droop'd head and bend the inverted spear! Genius and Art, your greenest wreaths bestow, And here, Religion, bid thy amaranths blow! Connubial Love, thy thornless roses bring, That shed o'er wintry life perpetual spring! Friendship and filial duty, blend your tears, Pour'd o'er the memory of departed years! Here, O ye Virtues, spread your palms divine, This once warm bosom was your chosen shrine. But since no gem escapes the sullying vein, No radiant sun the slightly-darkening stain, Some spots of frailty in that soul might rise, Whose altering form here cold and silent lies; Now, from his earthly bound for ever freed, Angel of mercy, for thy votary plead, Till Love redeeming wash his stains away, Ope the bright gate and give the nightless Day! EPISTLE TO F. C. R. MUNDY, Esq. OF MARKETON, DERBYSHIRE.—WRITTEN 1794 With pride, O Mundy, can a soul like thine Survey the stores of Fortune's golden mine; All her caprice can give, or can restrain, All that can glut the sordid, and the vain; The circling grove, the lawns extended wide, Flocks, white and numerous, on the green hill's side, The menial train, gay roof, and costly food, The graceful person, and the gentle blood; Since thy keen glance, where'er it turns, may see, Fools, coxcombs, villains, share those claims with thee?— Thee! on whose path Aonian splendours shine, And shame the treasures of the golden mine. No, Mundy, no!—th' injurious doubt forget, Pardon the needless fear, the vain regret, While in a juster scale thy spirit weighs The Muse's smile, with fashion's empty praise! But soft, thy steady purposes require Graver applause than vibrates on the lyre; Scorning to feed their fame with such slight things As fond libations from Pierian springs, From Burn, and Blackstone, they incessant draw The thicken'd juices of important Law! But ah! what equal honours can reward The toil, which to a Justice, chang'd a Bard! The author hopes she shall not be understood too seriously through this sportive poem. She has every honour for the profession of a public magistrate, and only means to say, that it does not require, she presumes, that brilliance of imagination, necessary to form a poet, accomplished as Mr Mundy. It is hoped she may be excused for trying to exait her honoured masters, the Bards. O! when clear spirits, generous, rapt, inspir'd, By judgment cultur'd, as by genius fir'd, Stoop from the heights, whence they had shed, sublime, Th' etherial essence of the deathless rhyme, And in the dimmer sphere of mortal light, Drop the strong pinion, plum'd for eagle-flight, Something we feel of that regretful pain, Impress'd by busy memory on the brain, Sad as she marks the illustrious Rousseau Rousseau supported himself, during several years, by copying music for the professors of that science, at the time when he refused royal gratuities. Imprint the harmonic types, intent and slow. How does the heart for wasted talents grieve, Recalling thus, the dark, improsp'rous eve, When one dull taper o'er the labour'd page Flings its weak ray, and aids the hapless sage With toil, like this, to obtain an humble bed, On which might rest secure his honour'd head! Deep shall the feeling heart his fate deplore, That sees him, from repeated treachery sore, With thirst of independence half insane, Its fever'd ardour throbbing through each vein, Scorn the luxurious board, where flattery sings, Scorn titled friendship, and the boon of kings, And earn scant viands to support that frame, Whose spirit lives, the immortal “Heir of Fame!” But, Mundy, thou, by kinder fate, art laid Where smiling affluence spreads her verdant shade. Not thee, Dependence' torpid hand restrains, Binding thy glowing soul in icy chains; Her freezing breath nor bids thy warblings cease, Nor blights the stainless lilies of thy peace; Then, from its track wilt thou thy spirit force, Though gleams of glory mark its happy course? O! tell it not, “Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon, lest the sons of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.” The reader will perceive the propriety of the personages introduced in this parody. The muses are desired not to mention Mr Mundy's preference of law to poetry, on the banks of the Hebrus, because it was there that the poet, Orpheus, was destroyed by Bacchanalian women, whose descendants would be likely to triumph in such a preference, from their hereditary aversion to the lyre; not in Lydia, because Midas, king of that country, decreed the palm to Pan, in his contest with Apollo.— His daughters, therefore, would probably exult in poetic apostacy. —It is thus “That our frail thoughts dally with vain surmise.”, ye bright Parnassian maids, On Hebrus' bank, nor in the Lydian shades, Lest Bacchanalian sons of Thrace rejoice, Lest Midas' daughters triumph in the choice! The sagest magistrate on Derwent side!— Is that the fame, to fire a Poet's pride? Shall Mundy bid the lyric pæan pause, That county-halls may murmur hoarse applause? I know thy specious maxim, to delude Thy mind's strong impulse from sublimer good, “Be useful.”—'Tis the motto of the wise, But efforts surely should with talents rise; Those efforts disproportion'd to the powers, In one erroneous stream of lavish'd hours Life glides,—and reason's tear regretful flows, Since no reflux the speedy current knows. Most useful he, perhaps, who tills the soil, Yet, to mean minds we leave that needful toil; But Mundy poises, through his wide command, The scales of equity with even hand!— We grant the purpose worthy, yet can see Numbers as equal to that task as he. Common humanity, and shrewd plain sense, May gain each honour Sessions can dispense, Acquire each art, by which his Worship knows The petty wounds of equity to close. Superior views the Poet's labours claim, Enduring good to man his glorious aim. In that high hope he bids the kindling page Illume with virtue's ray, the distant age; Till all of Great, of Amiable, and Wise, In brilliant lights, and beauteous colours rise; Gay imag'ry with moral precept blend, Nature's fine limner, Virtue's ablest friend, Such, as when standing in the forest green, The Bard immortalized Mr Mundy printed 500 copies, for presents to his friends, of one of the most admirable local poems in our language, bearing the name and describing, in the most appropriate traits, the scenery of Needwood Forest. The composition is enriched with moral sentiments, pathetic episodes, and fanciful machinery.the wood-wild scene, And mix'd, with skill, amongst the traces bright, Truth's mellow tints, and Pity's tender light. O shall he cease to hymn great Nature's stores, Her vales irriguous, her resounding shores; Her watry world, in azure curves display'd; Th' enamel'd mead, the forest's pomp of shade; All that the mountain's steepy summits yield; All that the morning's ruddy blushes gild; And all that basks in noon's refulgent glare, Or shadowy sinks beneath the evening star? O! shall he cease, on Virtue's charms serene, On Sensibility's enamour'd mien, On mild Philosophy's exploring care, On Wisdom beauteous, yet severely fair, On ardent Science, gentle Love, to throw Poetic hues of ever-living glow? Forbid the cold apostacy, ye powers That shed Aonian roses on his bowers! May Mundy's hand, illum'd by all your fire, Assert its claims, and reassume the lyre! Then, while each neighbouring squire, and justice, post, On Time's fleet wing, to cold Oblivion's coast, Though rich, as ere the liveried suit display'd, Though wise, as e'er the county-hall obey'd, Thou, finer spirit, urge thy happier way, Where shines, for Genius, Fame's unsetting day! Should coronets with stars and garters blend, And, at the royal nod, in state descend, Ah say, could Fortune, in her vainest mood, Deck'd with these glittering types of airy good, Vie with the powers, from Nature's hand obtain'd, By art and learning polish'd and sustain'd? Powers, that, exalting o'er the titled throng The glowing children of the deathless song, With immortality's bright meed reward The exalted labours of the honour'd bard; Such, Mason, as thy splendid verse displays, Or stream, in varied course, through Hayley's lays, Or as, when Beattie, 'mid the lonely vale, Breath'd all the soul of music on the gale, Whose tuneful numbers sacred truths impart, Fir'd the charm'd fancy, and exalt the heart. Mundy, the Nine ordain thou should'st aspire To share the sacred empire of the lyre; That ceaseless round thy auburn brows entwine Wit's sparkling gems, and fancy's rays divine. And shalt thou with a chill'd and thankless soul, Contemn their honours, and their fires controul? Or to their shrines thy glowing wreath The poem, Needwood Forest, which its author cannot be prevailed upon to publish generally. refuse, Who dipt its florets in their living dews? Ah no! thy talents are thy country's claim; Her public press, the Rubicon of fame, She bids thee pass;—and though its sable wave Prepares for Dulness a disgraceful grave, It must be past, ere Genius can attain Its destin'd goal in Glory's radiant fane. Far on the opposing shore thy sharpen'd sight May penetrate the altar's blazing height, And on its mystic tablet plainly see These lines, poetic Fame inscrib'd for thee. “To me, O Mundy, give the indebted lay, “Thy place is here,—my Minstrel, come away!” THE RED-BREAST and SPARROW. A FABLE. As near a rural cot a Robin sung, From the thatch'd roof an envious Sparrow sprung. Dost thou, he cried, in emulation proud, Vie with luxuriant Summer's plumy crowd, Who in gay bowers their various ditties weave, Charm the bright morn, or sooth the fading eve? O! why should'st thou thy feeble throat expand? Why, shivering, take thy solitary stand On the ice-crusted wall, or naked tree, As if dull Winter could be cheer'd by thee? Fastidious Critic, the mild warbler cried, Who deem'st the wish to please, obtrusive pride, Their strains adorn'd, while yet the year was young, The reign of beauty with the charms of song. Through wat'ry clouds when April sun-beams play'd, On the spruce foliage of the half-blown glade, At measur'd intervals, the Blackbird's lay, Sweet, though unvaried, hymn'd the crystal day; In May's bloom'd morn the Lark, with carol clear, Pierc'd, as he soar'd, the roseate climes of air; When through her copse, with hawthorns flowering round, The stealing moon-beams checquer'd all the ground, Silver'd the sheety lakes, and winding brooks, And shed their hoary light upon the rocks, Silence and Night in rapt attention hung On plaintive Philomel's transcendent song; Round the dark hills the melting cadence thrill'd, And widely floated o'er the whiten'd field. But ah! the choir of Summer chaunt no more, And the pale Months their silent throats deplore. Yet, nor from envy, nor ambition rise My little songs, that cheer the wintry skies; Superior lays, amid the vernal grove, Sing the bright reign of Beauty and of Love; And if my humble effort aught avails To gladden yon grey glens, and drifted vales, Weak, though I own the far inferior strain, 'Tis all I ask, nor have I sung in vain. MOUNT ETNA. WRITTEN AFTER HAVING READ MR BRYDONE'S TOUR THROUGH SICILY. Imagination, while thy kindling eyes Flame o'er the climes these faithful pages trace, O may'st thou paint them, as sublime they rise, In novel beauty, and horrific grace! Swell the rich treasures of poetic fanes With all the pomps that mighty Etna boasts, As, glaring o'er the affrighted deep, she reigns The pride, and terror, of Ausonian coasts! With thy keen glance the veils of distance pierce, With thy firm step conduct my venturous way, And on the texture of my proudest verse The changeful glories of those heights display! Now the proud steep climbing with toilsome tread, We mark the wonders of its triple zone; Mr Brydone tells us, that the three distinct seasons, Summer, Spring, and Winter, in inverted order, form the torrid, the temperate, and the frigid zone, round the ascending heights of Mount Etna. Round the broad base see sultry Summer lead The stores luxuriant of his glowing throne. While, on the rising edges of his clime, Emergent Spring her leafy mantle spreads, Woods, waving wide, in hues of vernal prime, Blue trickling rills and flower-embroider'd meads; Till Winter, o'er each blooming plain and grove, Draws the chill circle of his pallid line; Dim fields of ice, and gelid rocks above, And sleety gales, and dreary lakes combine. Then while, amaz'd, we lift exploring eyes To the vast Cone, high in the lurid air, We mark, in one eternal union, rise The elements, that wage eternal war. Deep in the snows, it has no power to melt, View the dread gulph, in all its boiling ire, Where sleet, and ice, and wintry waves, have felt How weak their force to quench its raging fire. Terrific Pinnacle! thy sides inclose The unfathom'd Gulph, coeval with the world; And by thy flames, that burst 'mid circling snows, Up sightless heights the blazing rocks are hurl'd. Their dire explosion rends the frozen mound, Shakes the firm earth, and thunders o'er the deep; While issuing deathful, from the fierce profound, Rolls the red Lava down the icy steep!— But we, in hours less terrible, prepare, Adventurous, to pursue our faithless way, And, though the drifted snows our steps ensnare, Reach the extremest point, ere dawns the day. Now long, pale gleams shoot thro' the sky, and warn Retreating darkness of the Solar glance; And hills, rocks, plains, and seas, and night, and morn, Blend, undivided, through the vast expanse. But morning, by degrees, exerts her power; The stars are quench'd!—the shadows melt away! Forests, that late seem'd like black gulphs to lour, Rise, in faint green, beneath the glimmering ray. Wide spread the skirts of strength'ning light around; And from the orient waves, that stretch serene, And with their silver line th' horizon bound, While states and nations dimly intervene, On plains, rocks, mountains, rivers, seas, and isles Bursts the gay Sun!—his plastic beams are hurl'd! And to our strain'd and startled senses, smiles, New to our gaze, a whole illumin'd World! While high exalted in the trackless air, Alarm'd, and doubting if on earth we stand, Scarce knows our sight to separate and compare The countless objects of its vast command. As on a map, o'er Sicily we look, Trace all her rivers through their mazy sweep, From their first source, a little gurgling brook, Till, breadth'ning soon, they mingle with the deep; But, rising at his spring a current wide, Devoted Acis Mr Brydone mentions the pecuhar coldness of this river, hence often called in Sicily, il fiume Freddo; also, that it rises out of the earth at once, a large stream. It is the river celebrated by the poets, into which the nymph Galatea transformed the shepherd Acis, her lover, after he had been killed by the giant, Polypheme. Mr Brydone ingeniously observes, that the extreme velocity of the current, seems, from our recollection of the fable, to be inspired by terror. hurries through the plain, Speeds from the Giant's voice with frighted tide, And throws his icy waters in the main. Here vine-clad Lipari, with her lucid streams, Gay Alicudi, and Panari there, While Strombola, a lesser Etna, gleams, And wreaths with spiral smoke the fields of air. These, as by magic, in the visual rays, Close drawn around the mountain skirts are shown, Seeming as lifted up to meet our gaze, Like medals in a watry bason thrown. This is Mr Brydone's own simile, and beyond any other which could have been chosen, brings to the mind's eye these peculiar effects of vision. Poets and orators often find themselves obliged to accommodate great things to our perception, by comparing them to small ones. These comparisons are often happy, and sometimes sublime. “Thou spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.” Milton compares the fallen angels in Pandemonium to bees, and Homer, Menelaus, guarding the dead body of Patroclus, to a fly. Instances of this sort in the noblest writers are innumerable. Then o'er the space immense weak vision strains, And feels its aching powers confus'd and lost, Else, that might view hot Barca's sandy plains, And verdant Thessaly's remoter coast. Now turn we, sighing, from the boundless scene, Mocking the feeble sight's eluded ray, While wonder mellows into thought serene, As sinks, in evening shades, the garish day. Here, while we rove beneath thy wayward skies, Green Albion, zoned by Ocean's azure wave, To Nature let our heart's thanksgivings rise For all she banish'd, as for all she gave; That not on our cold mountain-heights reside, On Snowdon or Helvellyn's peak sublime, The Etnean graces;—in their ardent pride, And baleful charms, exil'd this happier clime. Faithful if here their lineaments shall flow, O, Brydone! may the praise be thine alone! Since in thy traits arise, thy colours glow The bright Destroyers, on their Burning Throne! EPISTLE TO COLONEL ST. GEORGE. WRITTEN APRIL 1783, Sinec with the laurels, whose luxuriant bough Oft veils the sternness of the warrior's brow, For thee the arts their varied foliage twine, Their roses blossom, and their myrtles shine, Why, St. George, should thy soul disdain the powers So fondly cultur'd in the muses' bowers? O! shall the etherial dews, by Genius shed, In full libation, on thy favour'd head, Be scorn'd, for that their joy-dispensing flood Feeds not the wreath that vegetates on blood? Colonel St George had nobly distinguished himself in the late disastrous war with America. He now lives with a considerable part of his head shot away, and though feeble, emaciated, and in almost constant pain, his imagination and his virtues have lost nothing of their vigour. His wit, and genius for allegoric and humourous invention in the art of the pencil, are first-rate. He is singularly happy in the grotesque humour of some of his designs, in the sublimity of others, and in the originality of all. He is also a pleasing poet, though not a poetic author—but upon these talents he sets so little value as to seem disgusted when their excellence is praised. To the above note, coeval with the composition of the poem, its author grieves to add—that Colonel St George was assassinated, in the year 1798, in his house in Ireland, by the rebels —and thus finally perished for his attachment to the government of this country. Not so the warrior, who, like thee, surveys Heroic glory with an eagle's gaze, Great Frederic!—Form of steel, and soul of flame, Who shares with Swedish Charles the palm of fame! See him, the toils of camps and battles done, Pant for the softer wreaths by Fancy won, Spring to the muses' lists, and ardent dare The lyric contest with the gay Voltaire! Thou, whose high soul with kindred fires has glow'd Whose generous blood in fuller stream has flow'd, Whose finer fancy takes an ampler range, Sublime, and humourous, in graceful change, Ah! learn, like him, to prize the gentler powers, That brighten languid life's oppressive hours, Light with the torch of joy the social board, When Peace in lilies hides the sated sword. And pardon if beyond the deeds, that gain The loudest pæan on the martial plain, Each grace in thee my female sense admires, Of softer texture, and of milder fires, And, far beyond them all, the virtues bland, The melting heart, the unwithdrawing hand, That seek the Child of Want, and bounteous throw Sweet balm of comfort on the mourner's woe. Then, gallant St. George, let thy feeling heart Conceive how deeply pain'd reflection's smart, When I was taught to fear offence might spring Late that I rashly touch'd a grating string, By jealous honour proudly taught to jar, When he, that wears the garland of the war, Disgusted listens to the trivial voice, Whose warm applause shall make an humbler choice; Since, ah! too great of soul, the Hero says, “Praise not heroic is unvalued praise.” ODE ON TIME. O'er him, by health and fortune crown'd, Time steals with step so light, Scarce are his faint impressions found On the gay forehead's open round, Or shining orb of sight. Smooth as the young Camilla borne, With printless step and fleet, O'er plenteous fields of ripen'd corn, Whose bending stalks the gales of morn Bow on the passing feet. But o'er the dim form, press'd by woes, He treads with heavy pace, Sweeps his broad scythe, and, as he goes, Down falls the summer pride, and shows Worn Nature's furrow'd face. LOUISA TO EMMA, HER FRIEND IN THE EAST-INDIES. OCTOBER 21, 1779. Thee, Emma, four slow circling years have seen Press, with thy pensive foot, savannas green; Seen thee, with fond affection's moisten'd gaze, And the low-warbled song of former days, Wind round the shadowy rock, and shelving glade, Where broad Bananas stretch their grateful shade; Bend o'er the West thy longing eyes, and chide The tardy breeze that fans the unfreighted tide. Now, as with filial care thy light step roves, Through India's palmy plains, and spicy groves, To bless thee, exil'd thus in youth's gay prime, May sprightly health resist the torrid clime, Temper the sickly blast, the fever'd ray, And peace, and pleasure, lead the shining day! Yet, when thou know'st, for me that sorrow shrouds Hope's crystal mirror with impervious clouds, The sighs, and tears, that tenderest pity speak, Shall swell thy breast, and chill thy glowing cheek; Since one have been our pleasures, one our cares, From the first dawn of those delicious years, What time, inspir'd by joy's enlivening powers, We chas'd the gilded insect through the bowers; And oh! I fondly tell my anxious heart, The dearest truth experience can impart, That yet, to quench this sympathy of soul, Time, and the world of waters, vainly roll. O'er this deep glen, departing Autumn throws, With kind reverted glance, a short repose, Ere yet she leaves her England's fading scene, Where sickly yellow stains the vivid green, And many an icy morn, and stormy gale, Embrown the pathway of the winding vale. Now, while I seek the bosom of the glade, And the thin shelter of the impoverish'd shade, Unequal steps, and rising sighs, disclose The thorny pressure of tyrannic woes; And where the incumbent rock, with awful face, Bends o'er the fountain, gurgling from its base, And marks the limit of the silent dell, Sadly I sit, my bosom'd griefs to tell; Invoke thy spirit, those fond griefs to soothe, And bid, alas! their surging tide be smooth. It will not be;—since here, with yearning thought, By weak, involuntary impulse brought, Where love and memory bear resistless sway, And all the weakness of the soul betray! O ye known objects!—how ye strike my heart! And vain regrets, with keener force, impart! Slow, through the faded grove, past pleasures glide, Or sadly linger by the fountain's side. Dear, awful witness of a broken vow, Steep rock, how sternly frowns thy rugged brow! But, if the frequent blast shall bend thy pines, Clear at thy foot the crystal water shines! Though drizzling clouds the misty mountains veil, Yet the mild sun-beam gilds the narrow dale! Though vernal flow'rs this bank no more adorn, Nor Summer's wild rose blushes on its thorn, Yet shelter'd, mossy, dry, and warm, it draws The heedless roving step to quiet pause. Thus the pale year, though Nature's edicts urge Her step to Winter's desolating verge, Sedately passes to the drear domain, And breathes, e'en yet, soft comforts o'er the plain; But oh! for me, in youth's luxuriant glow, Hope's lovely florets wither as they blow! No grief my bosom at our parting knew, But that of bidding thee a long adieu; And the sweet tears, that such soft sorrows bring, Fall, as light rain-drops in the sunny spring; For youthful hope, subduing tender fears, Bounds o'er the gulf of interposing years; While, through their course, her airy hands avert Misfortune's arrow from the wanderer's heart. Soon then did cheerfulness the morn illume, And peace descend with evening's grateful gloom; They saw my breast in that clear spirit gay, Which speeds the social hour so fast away. Now expectation's fervour rose, to hail The youthful master of this quiet vale, My blooming brother—from Oxonia's towers, Who sought, with tender haste, his native bowers. 'Twas noon, and ripen'd summer's fervid ray From cloudless ether shed oppressive day. As on this shady bank I sat reclin'd, My voice, that floated on the waving wind, Taught the soft echoes of the neighbouring plains Milton's sweet lays, in Handel's matchless strains. Presaging notes my lips unconscious try, And murmur—“Hide me from day's garish eye!” Ah! blest, had Death beneath his sable shrine Hid me from all the woes that since were mine! Beneath my trembling fingers lightly rung The lute's sweet chords, responsive while I sung. Faint in the yellow broom the oxen lay, And the mute birds sat languid on the spray; And nought was heard, around the noon-tide bower, Save, that the mountain bee, from flower to flower, Seem'd to prolong, with her assiduous wing, The soft vibration of the tuneful string; While the fierce skies flam'd on the shrinking rills, And sultry silence brooded o'er the hills! As on my lip the lingering cadence play'd, My brother gaily bounded down the glade, And, while my looks the fire of gladness dart, With ardour press'd me to his throbbing heart; Then to a graceful stranger turn'd, whose feet, With steps less swift, my coyer welcome meet. O'er his fine form, and o'er his glowing face, Youth's ripen'd bloom had shed its richest grace; Tall as the pine, amidst inferior trees, With all the bending osier's pliant ease. O'er his fair brow, the fairer for their shade, Locks of the warmest brown luxuriant play'd. Blushing he bows!—and gentle awe supplies Each flattering meaning to his downcast eyes; Sweet, serious, tender, those blue eyes impart A thousand dear sensations to the heart; Mild as the evening star, whose shining ray Soft in the unruffled water seems to play; And when he speaks—not music's thrilling pow'r, No, not the vocal mistress of the bow'r, When slow she warbles from the blossom'd spray, In liquid blandishment, her evening lay, Such soft insinuating sweetness knows, As from that voice in melting accent flows! Yet why, fond memory! why, in tints so warm, Paint'st thou each beauty of that faultless form? His specious virtues surely might impart Excuse more just for this devoted heart. Oh! how each noble passion's seeming trace Threw transient glories o'er his youthful face! How rose, with sudden impulse, swift, and strong, For ev'ry secret fraud, and open wrong, The oppressor acts, the helpless feel, or fear, Disdain's quick throb, and Pity's melting tear! So well its part each ductile feature play'd, Of worth, such firm, though silent promise made, That to have doubted its well-painted truth, Had been to want the primal grace of youth, Credulity, that scorns, with gen'rous heat, Alike to practise, or suspect deceit. Cease, vain regrets; excursive fancy, cease! Ye only wound afresh my bleeding peace, And keep from gentle Emma's anxious ear, The event she longs, yet kindly dreads, to hear; But ah! nor singular, nor strange the tale, My sister-sufferers mourn in every vale; For gold, and dazzling state, incessant prove, In Man's hard heart, the murderers of love. While many a sun in summer-glory rose, Eugenio's lip no softer accent knows Than friendship dictates—but disorder'd praise, Scarce half-express'd; the musing ardent gaze; The varying cheek; the frequent smother'd sigh, Reveal the latent meaning of his eye; Plain, and yet plainer ev'ry hour, declare The shining secrecies, that languish there. These are the days that fly on rapture's wing, Empurpling ev'ry flower that decks the spring; For when delicious Hope, with whisper bland, Wakes the dear magic of her potent wand, More vivid colours paint the rising morn, And clearer crystal gems the silver thorn; On more luxuriant shade the noon-beam plays, And richer gold the evening-sun arrays; Stars seem to glitter with enamour'd fire, And shadowy hills in statelier grace aspire; More subtle sweetness scents the passing gales, And softer beauty decks the moon-light vales; All Nature smiles! nor e'en the jocund day, When festive roses strew the bridal way, Darts through the virgin breast such keen delight, As when soft fears with gay belief unite; As hope, sweet, warm, seducing hope inspires, Which somewhat questions, what it most desires; Reads latent meaning in a lover's eye, Thrills at his glance, and trembles at his sigh; As o'er the frame disorder'd transport pours, When only less than certainty is ours. At length, that rosy certainty appears, With faithless promises of golden years. Here, by this fountain side, Eugenio strove To trace the tender progress of his love; 'Twas on the evening of a splendid day;— Calm on the gilded grass the fountain lay! But oh! when doubt, in that dear moment, fled, A calm more sunny o'er my bosom spread! As the gay lark his last clear carol sung, And on a slanting sun-beam warbling hung, With sweeter music trill'd the vesper lay, Than when he soar'd amid the blaze of day; But yet a thousand times more sweet the sound, In which my soul its dearest blessing found! Slow on the Sun had stol'n the sailing cloud, And drawn o'er his gay fires the purple shroud, Then roll'd away!—till, by no shade represt, A far the setting orb emblaz'd the west; Lighted with arrowy beams the ocean caves, And sunk with splendour in the illumin'd waves. Thus oft would Modesty her blush employ, Coyly to veil the radiance of my joy; But from these eyes the sun-bright gladness beam'd, And all the triumph of my bosom stream'd! 'Twas here,—e'en here!—where now I sit reclin'd, And Winter's sighs sound hollow in the wind; Loud, and more loud the blast of evening raves, And strips the oaks of their last, lingering leaves; The eddying foliage in the tempest flies, And fills with duskier gloom the thick'ning skies. Red sinks the Sun, behind the howling hill, And rushes, with hoarse stream, the mountain rill, And now, with ruffling billow, cold, and pale, Runs, swoln, and dashing, down the lonely vale; While to these tear-full eyes, Grief's faded form Sits on the cloud, and sighs amid the storm! Yet, dreary vale! detain thy pensive guest, Though drizzling sleet beats cold upon her breast! To this sad soul more welcome are thy glooms, Than Spring's green bowers, or Summer's gaudy blooms; Nor asks an heart, that only breathes to sigh, A warmer mansion, or a kinder sky! And still that destin'd heart, so fond to mourn, And dwell on scenes, which never can return, Shrinks, e'en as guilty bosoms shrink from shame, To join with perfidy Eugenio's name; Feels its soft streams in ev'ry pulse recede From the pain'd mention of one barbarous deed, That kills my hopes, like Eurus' fierce career On the bright foliage of the early year; Which turns, while premature its buds disclose, To livid yellowness the damask rose. Thou see'st, my Emma, with what fond delay The unwilling spirit loiters on her way; Clings to past scenes that wore gay summer's form; Clings to the wildness of the wint'ry storm, To stop the sad narration, ere it throw, Dark on my fate, the long, long night of woe. Yet, O my soul! resume it, ere the power Of wasting sickness brings the fever'd hour, That stops the ill-guided pen in the weak hand, And shakes from life's dim glass the ebbing sand! Thou, Emma, wilt not blame my easy youth, That soon this heart declar'd its tenderest truth. Ah! could I dream he feign'd, whose glances warm With ceaseless ardour wander'd o'er my form? And as gay smiles, and youthful graces fair, Shone in my eyes, and harmoniz'd my air, Not one unheeded pass'd his eager gaze, His fervent, yet discriminating praise; Though oft he swore, amid the fond survey, The mind they grac'd was lovelier far than they; Protested oft, that mind was form'd to share Each high-soul'd purpose, and each virtuous care; Catch ev'ry new idea, as it rose, Partake his joys, and melt with all his woes; False could I think that vow, whose starting tear Sprung, the warm witness of a faith sincere? Now dawn'd the appointed, but unwelcome day, That bore my dearest brother far away, Where foreign climes might store his ripening youth, With observation, science, taste, and truth. The same sad day my lov'd Eugenio sigh'd Adieus impassion'd to his promis'd bride; Yet often urg'd, inspiring faithless ease, That between us fate spread no cruel seas;— Alas! in his chang'd heart my eyes explore, Of falsehood's waves,—a sea,—without a shore! Where Thames expands with freedom's wealthy pride, Attractive Commerce calls him to her tide; As with firm step she runs along the strand, And points to the tall ship, the distant land. His rising interests on the call attend, For with a father's prosperous fate they blend. Thus, with these interests, duty's filial power Unites to tear him from Louisa's bower; But parting sorrows yield them to the force Of strong necessity's resistless course, By generous confidence when lull'd to rest, That broods, on dove-like pinion, o'er the breast; While, from kind letters, rays of joy pervade The gloomy moments of the love-sick maid; And oh! how warm, how bright those letters glow'd. What ardent love, in melting language flow'd, My dearest Emma, thou wilt ne'er explore! The brilliant talismans are mine no more! Pride, virgin pride, pronounc'd the stern behest, And tore the faithless scriptures from my breast! Through four sweet months, to my delighted eyes These precious tablets of my bliss arise! At length, dread silence,—torturing doubt and fear. Prompt the pang'd sigh—but check the softer tear; Through the lone day, and lonelier night, impart “The hope deferr'd, that maketh sick the heart.” Wish'd morning comes!—and hour succeeds to hour! But still, suspense, and terror, o'er me lour; Chace each conjecture kind, with fierce controul, And send their cruel ice-bolts through my soul. Three wretched weeks my throbbing bosom bears The wounding conflict of its various fears, While Rumour's voice inflames my grief, and pride. And gives Eugenio to a wealthier bride. My trembling hands, the sick suspense to ease, From day to day the public records seize; While glances, rapid as the meteor's ray, Eager amidst the crowded columns stray; Snatch at sad certainty from busy fame, Yet dread to meet my dear Eugenio's name. Now glooms on the stain'd page the barbarous truth, And blights each blooming promise of my youth! Eugenio married!—Anguish, and despair, In ev'ry pompous killing letter glare! Thy love, a sacrifice to glut thy pride! Ah! what avail the riches of thy bride! Can they avail, remorseless as thou art, To tear the wrong'd Louisa from thy heart? Gold, and ye gems, that lurk in eastern cave, Or to the sun your gay resplendence wave, Can joys sincere, one heart-felt transport live In aught ye purchase, or in aught ye give? A bliss, to rival those thy avarice lost, Insolvent India shall but vainly boast! Was it for this my gentle brother's heart Bore in our growing loves so warm a part! That soft indulgence deck'd his open brows, That smiles fraternal hail'd our mutual vows! And, as he kindly breath'd the parting sigh, Love's crystal fluid rushing to his eye, Was it for this our blooming hopes he blest, Seiz'd our twin'd hands, and clasp'd them to his breast? Ah! did he know his lov'd Louisa's fate, What energy would nerve his rising hate!— Haste, my Lorenzo, to thy sister's aid! With thy swift vengeance be her wrongs repaid! Ye rising winds, his wandering sails restore! Ye refluent waters, bear him to the shore! And thou, vain bride! enjoy the meteor-ray, The fancied sun-beam of thy nuptial day! Stern fury waits, to quench its transient light, In deep, ensanguin'd, everlasting night!— Bleed, faithless, bleed! Louisa's wrongs explor'd, Shall frown relentless on her brother's sword!— Rash, lost Louisa! could'st thou bear the strife? Throw on a fatal chance thy brother's life? Or stretch, a victim to thy proud disdain, Eugenio, pale, and bleeding, on the plain? Endure that from a bosom, once so dear, Convulsive pangs the trembling life should tear! Oh! should'st thou, certain of the cruel truth, Behold, in fancy's eye, the slaughter'd youth, Could'st thou that lov'd, that lovely form survey, And see it faded to insensate clay? Eternal darkness on those eye-lids hung? Eternal silence stiffen on that tongue? No! wildly, from the bare surmise, I start, And treble fondness rushes through my heart; Live!—live, Eugenio!—free from fierce alarms. Blest, if thou canst, e'en in my rival's arms! O! safe, thro' lengthen'd years, may'st thou remain From all the varied forms of deathful pain! From injur'd honour's unrelenting ire, The blast of accident, the fever's fire! Soft may those dangerous graces melt away, And gently sink in scarce perceiv'd decay! For this my breast its cureless woes shall hide, Nor sting fraternal love, nor generous pride. Yes, dear Lorenzo! thou shalt still believe, Tho' much the thought thy gentle breast will grieve, Louisa, lost to tenderness, and truth, In the vain levity of thoughtless youth, Prov'd to Eugenio's love a cold ingrate, And lightly splenetic deserv'd her fate. Cruel remembrance! how shall I assuage The yearning pangs of thy incessant rage? What balmy comfort can the heart pervade, When bitter tears his broken faith upbraid, Whose hand, we fondly hop'd, should wipe away Their flowing sorrows through each future day? Since in reflection's grasp each blessing dies, When the forc'd struggling spirit must despise Him who, encircled with perfection's zone, Long in our sight scarce less than angel shone. For if credulity her warmth impart, With veils of light she screens the selfish heart; But barbarous perfidy's severe extreme, In shades eternal, shro uds each gorgeous beam. On the arch'd windows thus, that proudly grace An high majestic temple's awful face, When pours the setting sun its darting rays, An hundred solar orbs appear to blaze; But when the incumbent shades of louring night Curtain the source of this illusive light, Its evanescent fires no more remain, But horrors gather round the darken'd fane; The lofty turrets, desolately grand, In dreary state, and lonely silence stand; Through the dim aisles pale spectres seem to flit, And hollow groans the whispering walls repeat. So, round Eugenio's form, that rises yet, 'Mid pride's cold frown, and passion's warm regret, Depriv'd of all the lustre it retain'd, When gay belief with sunny hue remain'd, Incessant now the fiends of Avarice glide, With dark Ambition scowling at their side. Detested impotence of flatter'd charms, That could not bind my wanderer to my arms! Ah! what avail'd your beauties, but to lure That fleeting love, ye knew not to secure! Like opening flow'rs, that deck the desert glade, Fair to no purpose, flatter'd graces fade!— One healing draught—and all shall yet be well! “Peace is the pale-eyed sister of the cell,” The cell of Death—where misery only knows The soft exemption,—and the long repose. Ah no!—a guardian spirit seems to say, “Stay thee, Louisa, yet a little stay! “Awake not righteous Heaven's avenging hate, “By rashly plunging in the waves of fate! “Though time, for woes like thine, admits no cure, “Yet learn its hardest lesson, to endure! “Not long shall life her torturing sense impart “Of the barb'd shaft, that rankles in thy heart. “Thou shalt not need to stain thy spotless soul, “Nor want the ensanguin'd knife, the envenom'd bowl; “Thy soul's belov'd, by vain ambition fir'd, “Deaf, as the grave, to all that once inspir'd, “To love's soft voice,—to honour's awful plea, “Lives to another!—and is lost to thee!” Eugenio married!—Oh!—yon village bell, That flings on the cold gale its mournful knell! The solemn pause,—the loud repeated toll, Calling the pale corse to its darksome goal, Not plainer there the tale of death relate, Than these detested words pronounce my fate! Eugenio married, seals Louisa's doom, Her sure, though lingering passport to the tomb! And thou, soft mourner o'er my bosom's smart! Friend of my soul, and sister of my heart! A fallen blossom while thy tears embalm, Regrets that fondness prompts, let fondness calm; Since though this mortal frame, affection's slave, Wastes by the envenom'd wound that falsehood gave, I still possess, thus withering in my youth, The peace of innocence, the pride of truth; My soul is conscious of its heavenly sire, The cherub, Faith, has lent her wings of fire; Man, the base object of my scorn, it leaves, To join that gracious power, that ne'er deceives! When busy rumours to thy ear disclose The long enfranchisement of all my woes, Oh! let thy mind's pure eye behold me soar Where light, and life, from springs unfailing pour! Mark the bright circlets of the eternal morn, In radiant points, my smiling brows adorn! By kindred seraphs see thy friend embrac'd, Nor one slight thought on false Eugenio waste! Yet, though from pain and grief for ever free, Throw back soft pity's tender glance on thee! Smile at the human weakness of thy tears, And long to welcome thee to happier spheres! SECOND EPISTLE. EUGENIO TO EMMA, ON HER RETURN FROM THE EAST-INDIES. April 15, 1781. Start not, dear Emma, at an hapless name, Veil'd, to thy sense, in perfidy and shame! Oh! deep indeed the mists, they long have spread, To fancy's eye, round this devoted head! While deeper still the shades of anguish lower, Drear as the night upon the wint'ry bower, When bitter winds howl fearful o'er the plains, And the bright stars are quench'd amid the rains! So quench'd each smiling pleasure's roseate ray, That once illumin'd lost Eugenio's way! But e'er his tortur'd soul's incessant strife Burst the dark confines of disastrous life, Given, or with-held, by Emma's guardian hands, As her friend's peace hereafter best demands, Will she receive Eugenio's last request, In faithful trust for her Louisa's breast, Hear his sad story—that yet dares appear To claim her justice, and implore her tear? If so, let now thy gentle heart incline To mourn the trials, and the pangs of mine! No longer shalt thou think I basely sold My peace, my liberty, my love, for gold: That gold did purchase them, we know too well; But Oh! no sordid sacrifice they fell! Learn then those dire events, whose tyrant sway Forc'd me to throw joy's vital root away, Yield my Louisa to their stern controul, Gem of my youth! and day-star of my soul! To thee, so long accustom'd to disclose Whate'er on life the strengthen'd colour throws, To thee Louisa questionless appeal'd! Reveal'd my vows, my broken faith reveal'd; Taught thee, through scenes, now past and gone, rove, And hate the mean apostate to his love. Veil'd by her native groves, I left the maid, And journey'd onward from that blooming glade, With eyes, full oft reverted as I pass'd, With many a look to heaven in fervour cast, To implore protection for Louisa's peace, Her health's dear safety, and our love's increase. Ere yet I join'd the animated train, Whose full-fraught vessels seek the ports of gain, To that domestic scene I bent my way, Which far in Deva's woodland mazes lay; A rural kind retreat from all the cares Which busy Commerce for her sons prepares. Translucent Deva the green valley laves, And darkling alders screen her wandering waves, Till slow she rises from o'er-hanging shades, And, seen, at distance, through the opening glades, With bank less veil'd, and streams that mildly shine, Leads round the lonely hills her silver line. In that sweet dale, and by a mountain's side, Whose sheltering heights the angry North deride, Abode, so late, of cheerfulness and ease, White gleams the mansion through the waving trees! Tall are the trees that whisper round its walls, And soft the path-way down the valley falls! Oh! how each charm, that decks the quiet scene, Assum'd new grace, and wore a softer mien, From the blest thought, that soon the nuptial hour Would lead Louisa to my native bower! 'Twas there my gentle parents often knew The calm sweet night, the day that lightly flew; And there the heart-felt pleasure gaily shew'd Eugenio's welcome to the green abode. A father's elevating gladness proved How dear the presence of the son he loved. My gentle mother, archly smiling, prest The love-sick wanderer to her honoured breast; For so she fondly called her darling youth, Yet lov'd his ardour, and approved his truth. My sisters, fair, ingenuous, graceful maids, The acknowledg'd pride of all the neighbouring shades, Met me with bounding step, and joyous mien, And rays of transport brightened all the seene. Nor wilt thou, mighty Love! upbraid my heart, For bearing in their joys so warm a part; Since no ambition gloomed my father's brow, No thirst of wealth reproached my plighted vow; He scorned to name Louisa's want of gold, But gladly listened while her worth I told. Pleased has he seen her in this melting eye, Pleased with her name, half whispered in a sigh; Then would I grasp his hand, and ardent say, “Oft shall my parents bless our bridal day, “Since, from that soul of sweetness, they shall share “A daughter's tenderness, an angel's care; “For hers each virtue, and each grace refin'd, “That breathe on loveliness the glow of mind, “And, with assiduous duty's cheering power, “Strew life's worn path with ev'ry filial flower.” One eve, as on the shady bank I rode, Where through new dales the beauteous Deva flow'd, Loitering I listen to the red-breast clear, The last, lone songster of the waning year. Light o'er the leaves sweet Autumn breathes serene, And tips with gold their yet unfaded green. Now many a vapour grey the stream exhales, And twilight steals unheeded on the vales; O'er the hill tops the lines of crimson run, The glowing raiments of the vanished sun; Nor yet the deep'ning shades of night impede My roving course, which pensive musings lead, What time the moon of Ceres mildly throws Her shadowy grace, and breathes her soft repose O'er the dark shrubs, that clothe the rocky steeps, Shelve from their tops, and fringe the crystal deeps; While, as around those rocks the river glides, White moon-beams tremble in the glancing tides. Sudden, wild sounds are borne along the gales! The piercing shriek my startled ear assails! But scarce a moment, with check'd rein, I stand, The uplift'd cane grasp'd sternly in my hand, Ere bending forward o'er my eager horse, Urging, with needless spur, his rapid course, And plunging through the deep, opposing flood, I pierce the tangled mazes of the wood. On fibrous oaks, that roughen all the ground, My steed's fleet hoofs with hollow noise resound; And, doubled by the echoes from the caves, Appal a guilty band of desperate slaves; For soon, in ruthless, felon-gripe, I found A beauteous female, screaming on the ground; Dragged from her horse, that grazed unconscious near, Her tresses torn, and frantic with her fear. Two liveried youths, attendant on the maid, At the first onset in that gloomy glade, Had, or seduced by gold, or winged by dread, From danger, and from duty, coward fled. Alarm'd, the villains quit their struggling prey, And two, with terror struck, speed fast away. Fiercer the third, the arm of blood extends; The levell'd tube, in dire direction, bends! Yet no cold fear arrests my vengeful force, And his wing'd death-ball flies with erring course; But not descends my nervous blow in vain, The hidden lead indents the murderer's brain; With one demoniac glance, as down he fell, The soul starts furious from its vital cell. Then tender pity and assiduous care, Conduct me swiftly to the swooning fair. The light, cool drops, scoop'd from the neighbouring spring, O'er her pale brow solicitous I fling; Till life's warm tide, which long the heart detains, Returns, slow purpling the forsaken veins. In one deep sigh, as recollection came, It wakens gratitude's impetuous flame. ‘For more than life,’ exclaims the trembling maid, ‘I stand indebted to thy generous aid.’ ‘Cease, fair-one, cease: well might this arm deserve ‘That deadliest palsies wither ev'ry nerve, ‘Had it refus'd the aid to thee it gave, ‘Or coward shunn'd the duty of the brave! ‘But let me now, since danger haunts delay, ‘To safer scenes my lovely charge convey. ‘Deep in yon vale, Ernesto's modest dome ‘Lifts its fair head—my tranquil, happy home! ‘There ev'ry welcome shall her steps receive, ‘That hospitable affluence knows to give.’ This said, her trembling form, with anxious haste, My twining arms on her light courser plac'd; Then, as emerging from the darkling wood, Along the moon-bright dales we slowly rode, Surpris'd his gorgeous trappings I behold, The net of silver, and the thongs of gold; While all the vestments of the lovely dame The pride of elevated rank proclaim. The costly lace had golden leaves imprest Light on the borders of the pearly vest; Her taper waist the broider'd zone entwines, Clasp'd by a gem, the boast of orient mines; On as we pass, on ev'ry side it gleams, And to the moon, in trembling lustre, streams. Dear Emma, that the splendid garb could gain, E'en in an hour exempt from grief and pain, The attentive gaze, proves my devoted heart From eyes so bright met no resistless dart; For when the maid Love's potent cestus wears, The jealous God no glance dividual bears. Ah! in those halycon days, a mind at ease Empower'd slight things to interest, and to please; That memory should their faded tints relume, When deprivation's deepest shadows gloom, Perhaps seem strange!—but now, that full, and free, My long imprison'd spirit springs to thee, Friend of my love! to whom I dare reveal All that my soul has felt, or knows to feel, So softened seem the asperities of grief, My senses anchor on the kind relief; With trivial circumstance retard the pen, Ere languid solitude shall lour again; For oh! when, lost in woes of lengthen'd date, Alone we've lean'd upon the thorn of fate, Seeking, at last, the kind assuasive rest, Found only on compassion's downy breast, We feel, as soft the imparted sorrows flow, Almost discharged the bitterness of woe. Within Ernesto's hospitable gates, Alarme at my delay, Affection waits; But as I lead the bright distinguished maid, Explain her danger, and my prosperous aid, The dear inhabitants around her move, With deep respect, kind care, and generous love. And soon we learn, our peaceful walls contain The splendid heiress of a vast domain, Emira, she, whose wealth, and charms, inspire The crowd of titled youth with amorous fire; While rumour paints her, midst the obsequious train, Though frolic, insolent; though haughty, vain. But to our eyes, these wild and wandering fires Are screen'd by rising hopes, and gay desires; For still, the parting hour with care delay'd, Emira loiters in Ernesto's shade; The noon-tide sun, the evening's softer ray Beholds the fair one through the valley stray; Thus, on Matilda leaning, Eugenio's sister. fondly own Her heart's new choice in passion's warmest tone. “Lost to the world, for ever could I dwell “In the dear precincts of this sylvan cell; “Renounce each vain, though once ador'd delight, “That dissipates the day, or gilds the night; “That can each gay seducing art employ, “To flatter beauty, and inspirit joy.” Thus the proud maid, of all her scorn disarmed, By strange, and partial preference strongly charmed, Feels a new Eden steal upon the bowers, And chides with sighs the swiftly fleeting hours; Still at the cheerful board, or as she roves Along the plain, or lingers in the groves, Each glowing wish, from new-born passion sprung. Each soft disorder, on her eye-lids hung, At my approach reveal, though much in vain, What words are little wanted to explain. Vain! had I never seen the matchless grace, The touching sweetness of Louisa's face; Where from each feature beams, or mildly plays, Refined intelligence, with varying rays; Where native dignity, with air serene, Conscious, not arrogant, adorns her mien; While from those eyes, in scorn of artful wiles, The tender spotless soul looks out, and smiles,— These unbeheld, yet still Emira's charms Had ne'er allured Eugenio to her arms; For oh! the fevered languor of the eye, The restless blushes, the voluptuous sigh, The impatient haughtiness, but half concealed, The rage of pleasure in each glance revealed, Though, in youth's fervid hours, perchance they fire The kindling ardours of unawed desire, Quench, while the transient flames their force impart, The torch of passion, ere it reach the heart. 'Twas thus the youthful Ithacan survey'd The Goddess Nymph, beneath her magic shade; While Eucharis' mild beauties foil'd the sway Of charms, that deck'd the Daughter of the Day; By love protected, when the princely boy Beheld the dame her wonted lures employ; Saw her fine form, by all the graces drest, The glowing purple of the floating vest, And on her blooming cheek the tresses bright, That play'd in wavy wreaths of golden light, Or on her snowy bosom, shining fell, Like a warm sun-beam on a lily's bell. Not more Emira's charms my soul engage, The fair Calypso of a sensual age; And than licentious beauty less, the stores That splendid fortune on Emira pours; Or the proud boast of lineal blood, allied To rank, and power, could wake that senseless pride, Which quenches the soft warmth that love inspires, And lights the nuptial torch with rayless fires. To save the fair-one from the thorny smart Of hopeless passion, rankling in her heart, I urge my gentle sisters to reveal All my charm'd senses for Louisa feel; The worth, the graces, which around her wait, And all the smiling prospect of our fate. Emira listens with impassion'd scorn, Of wounded pride, and rival anger born. Unwished, unwelcome, as the theme arose, Her clouded cheek in deep suffusion glows, Proudly exclaiming,—“ Can Eugenio prove “Cold, and obdurate to my lavish love? “Has beauty's magic zone my bosom bound, “Does rank exalt me, and has fortune crown'd, “That faint attractions in a village maid “Should shield the passions which these eyes invade? “Impossible!—but oh! thy lips impart “The sting of jealousy, that goads my heart. “Matilda, all my waking dreams divine “Thy charming brother shall at length be mine! “This grovelling flame was but ordain'd to prove “Thy friend's wish'd triumph at the shrine of love, “And, by comparison of brighter charms, “To light Eugenio to Emira's arms.” Thus, while self-flattering pride her mind assures, The artful Fair-one spreads her varied lures; Sometimes, with archness laughing in her eyes, Hangs on my arm, and ridicules my sighs; And oft with coyer tenderness appears, While love's warm glances steal through shining tears; Now, with arch'd brow, and supercilious stare, Affects the empress dignity of air; And now, as reasoning with a wayward heart, In trances, broken by the frequent start, With pausing step she wanders through the grove, A female Proteus in the wiles of love! To muse at leisure on my lovely maid, And woo her image in the lonely glade, Where no Emira, by the rigid laws Politeness dictates, my attention draws, Far in the wilds I wander through the day, And to a lowly cot at midnight stray; There taste the sweetness of that deep repose, Which from applauding conscience gently flows, When health, and hope, their downy pinions spread, And scatter roses on the youthful bed. Light with the dawn disperse my tender dreams; And now the Sun looks golden on the streams!— O Morn! the last for me that gaily rose, On Memory's tablet still thy beauty glows. Charmed, as I wandered through the dewy vale, And drank the spirit of the mountain-gale, How little did my unconscious heart divine, The joys thou gav'st should ne'er again be mine! On as I roved along the winding glades, A youth in haste the sylvan copse pervades! Says, his commission instantly recalls My devious step to the paternal walls. Upon the rustic countenance appears A fixed solemnity, that wakes my fears. “Oh! is all well?”—with breathless haste I cry. “Thy friends are well,”—his faltering lips reply; Then dread, lest sad intelligence invade The precious quiet of my native shade, Sickens my heart;—and swiftly as I go, From my pale lip disorder'd accents flow; Each moment, for Louisa's life, arise Prayers, that implore the mercies of the skies. And now my quick, unequal steps are led, A day of gladness where they used to spread; But ah! no silver tones Eugenio call! No bounding footstep meets me in the hall! Suspense, with all its heavy heart-ach, teems, And palpable the solemn stillness seems! So, when returning from the well-fought plain, As near thy castle-walls thou led'st thy train, O Hardiknute! such pangs as these opprest, In hope's warm hour, thy brave, and veteran breast. Along the midnight glooms, that thick impend, While howls the storm, the beating rains descend, Thou see'st no guard upon the turret's height, Whose streaming torches used to gild the night! Black, as a mourning weed, they silent stand, And daunt the stoutest heart in Scotia's land! Appalled, like him, I felt the stillness dire; Eager to learn—not daring to enquire; As one transfix'd, a few dread minutes wait, While silent horror shrouds impending fate! My Father entered—with a cheek how pale! And oh! that look!—it told an awful tale! 'Twas mournful!—supplicating!—“Heavenly powers! “In that dim gaze how deep an anguish lowers! “Louisa! lives she?”—dreading the reply, My soul hung trembling in my straining eye. “My son, the sweet Louisa lives,—and knows, “I hope, the peace that innocence bestows; “Oh! may it long be hers!—but now remains “A task for me, replete with sharpest pains!— “Eugenio!—Penury's dire blasts assail, “And hope is frozen in the bitter gale! “Yes,—Belmor has deceiv'd my boundless trust, “To friendship treacherous, and to faith unjust! “Unhappy hour, when confidence entire “Lur'd me to follow that misleading fire, “Those gay commercial visions, false, and vain, “The glittering meteors of his artful brain! “Too well he knew no genuine light they gave, “And now they sink in ruin's whelming wave! “Oh! great, and numberless the ills, that spread “Their mingled horrors round this aged head! “The pang of seeing thy sweet sisters, born “To fairest hopes, from ease and affluence torn “Exposed to all those guileful snares, that wait “The beauteous indigent's disastrous fate! “Ills, whose bare dread a Father's bosom tears, “And blends with agony his anxious cares. “Thy dearest Mother!”—Here he turn'd his head, And pausing wept;—at length, resuming, said, “These hovering woes, that o'er our house impend, “Thou, my dear Son, e'er their dread weight descend, “Thou canst avert!—but oh! at what a price! “Persuasion shall not urge—nor prayers entice. “Two hours ere thy return, Emira found “Thy Sisters' eyes in streaming torrents drowned; “Learn'd, from their trembling lips, the cruel cause, “Which the dark cloud of consternation draws “Wide o'er my roof—that yesterday survey'd, “Domestic comfort's fair, and favourite shade. “We know that fortune on Emira pours “Her golden treasures in unstinted showers.— “Eugenio! she stands ready to replace “Thy Father's comforts on a lasting base! “Rescue his failing fame!—the numbers save, “Whose hopes in his destruction find a grave; “Andlight, while woe's dark cloudher wealth removes, “Joy's living spark in many an eye he loves! “But at the price—Great God!—thy Father's fears “Shrink from the sound, and whelm it with his tears! “By sharp distress at last to name it driven!— “Thy hand to her,—e'en at the altar given!— “Alas! the impossibility e'en now “Glooms in the grief, the horror of thy brow!— “Oh! for myself—I could not wish to gain “Exemption from the sharpest earthly pain, “By banishing each hope, his love had won, “From the kind, duteous bosom of my son! “But for their dearer sakes who fall with me, “Perhaps I dare—to hope e'en this from thee. “Thou know'st, when peace and plenty's jocund powers, “Hung theirripe clustersround our blooming bowers, “The joys that love, not those which wealth impart, “Form'd the warm wish for thee, that fill'd my heart; “But now—Eugenio, listen, could'st thou bear “Louisa's breast this weight of woes should share? “Would'st thou the blossoms of her youth transplant “Into the blasting soil of worldly want? “Whose pangs, though ne'er her soft complaints reveal, “She will not therefore less severely feel; “Since, when a breast, far dearer than our own, “Receives the darts by that fell demon thrown, “Fast wasting health, and spirits broke, will prove, “Far from extracted, they are barb'd by love.” Here sighs, that seem'd to shake his frame, betray'd How deep he felt the sorrows he pourtray'd; But yet, though still his heart with anguish bled, Fail'd speech recovering soon, again he said: “It is not much my waning life's remains “Should shorten'd sink by penury's cruel pains; “Ah! rather could I bear their utmost strife, “Than wish to quench the torch that gilds thy life. “Sweet possibility! which yet appears, “Borne on the eventful flight of days, and years, “Whose chance propitious might each bar remove, “Or industry restore the joys of love; “Though sharp the consciousness, that Belmor's art “Must to my fame the deadliest wound impart! “For oh! the many, who their ruin owe “To my rash hope's unhappy overthrow, “Will, without scruple, think by fraud I won “The confidence, which drew that ruin on. “Hard to resign, for such opprobrious blame, “The honest triumph of a spotless name; “E'en when the heart dares to itself appeal “From blind injustice, and misguided zeal! “Their torrent reason strives to stem in vain; “Truth pleads to air, if prejudice arraign. “Her censures daily level with the base “A thousand names, no actual crimes disgrace; “Pull down the fame a life of virtue built, “And stamp imprudence with the brand of guilt. “And yet, I would not ask my child to save “From pains, that seem to rob of rest the grave, “My hapless spirit, at a price so great, “To shade perchance with deeper gloom his fate! “But, oh! my lov'd Eugenio!—from a woe, “Sharper, I trust, than thou wilt ever know, “My sense recoils!—my wife!—my dearest wife! “The sweet companion of my lengthened life! “Thy mother!—for whose peace, and health, my cares, “My fond attention, my incessant prayers, “The day and night beheld!—Oh! must I see “That dear one pine in helpless poverty? “While pale, and trembling, sinks the vital flame, “Must her soft, delicate, and feeble frame, “To charity's donation, cold, and scant, “Owe its exemption from extremest want? “Can I see this, unable to obtain “Those common comforts the laborious gain, “Conscious, my own infatuate rashness shed “This bitter phial on her gentle head? “My Son!—my Son!”—Then, on my shoulder thrown, Heart-smote, and wan, he heav'd the bitter groan. Oh! while these arms their honour'd burden prest, As his sunk cheek felt cold upon my breast, What words can paint the deep distress I bore, What horror smote me, and what anguish tore? Could I behold the author of my birth Thus bend in woe the hoary head to earth; Round his weak frame such whelming anguish rage, Nor snatch from the dread storm his failing age, Because my hopes—my peace, perhaps my life Were doom'd to perish in the filial strife? Impossible!—the softer passions fly, Nor dare dissolve great Nature's primal tie. “Be comforted, my father!—Could thy son, “Oh! could he live to see thee thus undone, “Endure the knowledge, that when fortune gave “The power to save thee, he refus'd to save? “The torturing self-reproach must rend his brain, “And wake to phrenzy the remorseful pain. “But O my love!—yet pardon me!—I go “Alone to stem conflicting tides of woe! “I go, to teach my soul her arduous task, “And gain by prayer the fortitude I ask!” So saying, to his couch my sire I led, And smoothed the pillow for his languid head. With softer tears his trembling eye-balls shone, And faltering accents ardent blest his son. Then up the mountain's steep and craggy side, With step precipitate, I wildly stride; Now stung with tortures of the last despair; Now sunk in grief;—now energiz'd by prayer; Nor yet in vain the heart-rending efforts prove, Warm duty rises over bleeding love! The struggle past!—my peace!—my freedom given! Thy anchor, Hope, on shoreless oceans driven! What then to justice, or to love remained, But to restore the heart, my vows had gained? Wrench from Louisa's breast its cherished bane, And nobly the last sacrifice sustain? Renounce her pity, and inspire her hate, In tenfold gloom though it involve my fate? Teach her to think the villain-baseness mine, That bows the venal heart at fortune's shrine? So might the indignant sense of barter'd truth Quench the disastrous passion of my youth; Now doom'd to darken every hope, that cheers, With shining promises, the rising years! Had I the dread necessity explained, That with resistless force my freedom chained; Tore the sweet bands, by virtuous passion tied, And stampt our constancy with parricide; Then had Louisa fortified my soul, And urged my ling'ring step to duty's goal; Had given me back, with pity's softest brow, Of love so ruinous, the ill-starred vow; A self-devoted exile fled my arms, But sorrowing fled them, and resigned her charms To fruitless constancy, and fond regret; Ordained to mourn—unable to forget; That pine in solitude the live-long day, Feed on the heart, and steal the life away. Louisa's pity had my sufferings found, Somewhat it sure had balm'd the embosomed wound; But since e'en her dear sympathy was weak, Of fate's dread shaft the envenomed point to break, I strove to avert the slow-consuming pain, And, for the conflict, armed her with disdain; That cruel conflict, which the passions prove, Ere high-souled scorn subdues a rooted love. Still, to my being's latest verge, be borne The dear, mistaken maid's unceasing scorn; Ah! be they borne in this unhappy breast, To the cold bed of its eternal rest! Near seems that rest my wearied life desires, Pain breaks her springs, and sickness dims her fires; And hope, who comes in sable vest array'd, Points, with pale hand, to death's eternal shade! But yet,—when past the expiatory doom, When misery's shafts lie broken on my tomb, The exploring gaze, sweet Emma, kindly bend On the dear bosom of thy beauteous friend; If thou shalt mark, that cold contempt sustains The seat of softness from assaulting pains; That no dim tears her cheek's warm roses pale, No sighs of anguish swell the lonely gale, Whose murmurs o'er the grass-green sod shall rise, Where cold, and peaceful, lost Eugenio lies, Then, that thou name me not, my soul implores, Nor snatch the peace away disdain restores; The cruel change thy tenderness will fear, Of pride's stern frown, for pity's heart-wrung tear. Oh! shall one selfish wish her peace invade, That love so agoniz'd may sooth my shade? No, Emma, no!—my soul for hers shall wait, Till soft it pass the everlasting gate; From those dear eyes till light divine shall clear The film, that mortal chance had darken'd here; Fond memory's deep reproach for aye remove, And pleading seraphs reunite our love! But oh! should pity, with intrusive sway, Range her sad images in dire array, And to Louisa's mental sight disclose The bed of death—the agonizing throes; Oh! should she think she sees in struggles rise That breath, which wak'd for her the fondest sighs! Those eyes, whose softness shall no more betray, Throw their last glances on the final day!— In such an hour, should scorn, and anger prove Weak to dispel the grief-awaken'd love; Sorrowing for him, who could her hopes deceive, Should she, in bitterness of spirit, grieve For guilt, which, unextenuated, rears Barriers to last beyond this vale of tears; Then, Emma, then, the sad events relate, That wove the sable texture of our fate. My dear Louisa!—pardon him, who strove, By means so seeming harsh, to quench thy love! Hard was the task, that kindness to resign, Which my torn bosom could demand of thine; Esteem, that might have borne eternal date, Since plac'd, by virtue, past the reach of fate; That bless'd compassion, my sad lot had won, A wretch by fortune, not by crimes undone; These to renounce!—with my own hand to throw In her dark chalice added dregs of woe; To pierce my soul with voluntary pains, A suicide on comfort's last remains, Was hard!—but generous love the effort made, Thy quiet ask'd;—I trembled and obey'd! When to that purer world our souls are borne, Where every veil from every breast is torn, My willing spirit, in the realms above, Shall meet the searching eye of wounded love To thee, Louisa, my past woes impart, And hear thy angel voice absolve my heart. THIRD EPISTLE. LOUISA TO EMMA, WRITTEN THE DAY AFTER SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM HER EUGENIO'S EXCULPATING LETTER. April, 21, 1781. O thou soft hope, that once with lustre gay Didst gild the hours of love's delicious day! What, though no more the lively joy remains, That trac'd thy light step o'er these earthly plains, Yet, piercing now despair's incumbent shroud, Soft hope, thou lookest from yon parting cloud; And my lov'd Emma's hand the vision shews, That smiles my struggling spirit to repose! Bright in Eugenio's vindicated truth, That vision lights anew my drooping youth; Since, in perspective beauteous, it displays A long eternity of blissful days; Of all those sacred joys our souls shall prove, “When pleading seraphs reunite our love.” 'Tis true, Eugenio, through life's thorny way, In far divided paths our steps shall stray; It is not given us, when rude blasts assail, And pale misfortune breathes the bitter gale, It is not given, to temper, and assuage, Each for the other's breast, its cruel rage; Nor mutually to feel the cheering rays, When health, and joy, inspirit summer-days. Our little barks, their flattering port in view, Fate, on life's billowy surge, asunder threw; Friend of my soul! we are not doom'd to gain The sunny isle of that tempestuous main; But Oh! thy virtue, long imagin'd lost, Has felt the wreck of no insidious coast! The deep and troubled floods, it knew to brave! It rises buoyant on the stormy wave! Vain are those storms, by which its course is driven, Since sure, though distant, is the port of Heaven. My dear Eugenio, the dread voice will prove Indulgent to the frail excess of love, Which to such sad extremes would blindly run, Lavish of health, and sickening at the sun; Since, while an unaccusing conscience threw The eternal portals open to my view, My spirit sunk, a prey to fond despair, And coldly view'd that Heaven thou could'st not share; Soil'd with its griefs those amaranthine flowers, Inwove by faith in bright religion's bowers. Angel of Mercy! thou wilt gently breathe Exhaling sighs upon that sullied wreath; And the dim stains of my impatient tears, Impassion'd yearnings, and desponding fears, Shall vanish, as chill dews that morning throws, By summer winds are wafted from the rose! Oh! how o'er-joy'd my dazzled sight surveyed These words, in Emma's characters pourtray'd, “He is not guilty!”—rapid from my tongue They, in exulting iteration, sprung. “Read, dear Louisa, and acquit the heart “That bears in all thy griefs so large a part.” Think'st thou, my Emma, thy benign command Met an unwilling eye, a tardy hand? Heaven! with what force these hands, these eyes, impell'd, Seize the known characters, so long with-held! While every letter, ere examin'd, wears The uninjur'd magic of the vanish'd years! Disorder'd sounds my lips pronounce, nor spare The useless question to the unconscious air. “Does that dear hand yet trace Louisa's name? “Will it his love, his innocence proclaim? “How may this be?—yet Emma says 'tis so.” Then did I read, and weep, and throb, and glow, Approve, absolve, admire, and smile, and sigh, Till pensive Peace shone mildly in my eye; Back with that lost esteem, my heart deplor'd, The wanderer came, with half her rights restor'd. So luckless Clairmont's thorny path she smooths; So his sharp sense of many an ill she sooths; One dear recover'd hope his grief beguiles, And, 'midst the wreck of all the rest, he smiles. Emma, thou knew'st him well;—the jocund youth, Ambition's votary, yet of taintless truth. Lur'd by the wealth the glowing Andes hide, He long'd to pass the interposing tide. Remembrance sees him on the sea-beach stand, His fair Clarissa weeping on his hand. With anxious smiles her varying cheek he dries, And talks of prosperous winds, and favouring skies. Clear was the sky, and gentle were the gales, And wide and waving stream'd the snowy sails; While, tossing the green sea-weed o'er, and o'er, Crept the hush'd billow on the shelly shore; Soft as the autumnal breeze among the sheaves, Or gently rustling in the fallen leaves; And rolling in blue light the watery way With frosted silver seem'd bedropt and gay. Impatient Clairmont led his pensive bride, As slow she scal'd the vessel's stately side. So smooth the seas, the tall bark seem'd to sleep, While her gay pennants ting'd the glassy deep. Day after day mild breezes freshen'd round, Till skies alone the mighty waters bound. But now, far distant from Britannia's shore, Round craggy steeps where angry billows roar, Rise the dark winds!—and borne on flagging wing, On the bent mast the screaming Fulmars cling! And soon the fury of the wildest storm That could the vext and swelling sea deform, With death's shrill voice, shrieks in the rending shrouds, As mounts the dizzy vessel to the clouds; Or prone shoots swiftly to the billowy vale, While the wet seaman's altering cheek is pale. The whirling ship the guiding rudder mocks, It strikes!—it bursts upon the bulging rocks! Unhappy Clairmont, who had vainly tried In the toss'd boat to place his beauteous bride, Sees on the deck, pale, trembling, as she stood, The sudden billow dash her to the flood; While on the riven plank himself convey'd, With only life, beneath a stranger shade, Wakes from the briny trance, and wakes to know, Of fate's dark stores, the most accomplish'd woe! Borne by a friendly sail, that now he stands A ruin'd wanderer on his native lands, Seems little;—Love's severer tortures reign With force despotic, and exclusive pain. This borne, from month to month, and year to year, At length unlook'd-for tidings charm his ear; His fair Clarissa lives!—on coasts unknown Wreck'd like himself, unfriended and alone, By destiny severe, an hapless slave, Pines on rude shores beyond the Atlantic wave; Yet, that she lives is so unhoped a joy!— Before it doubt, and fear, and anguish fly! She lives!—and fate may aid the ardent strife, And to his arms restore his long-lost wife! In that dear hope pale misery's tortures cease, And agony subsides almost to peace. So I—but to Eugenio swift impart How full the pardon of Louisa's heart! Oh! let him not repent he wrung her mind With fruitless woes, so generously design'd; Since, though they fail'd her freedom to restore, Had she not long been destin'd to deplore His mind, as cruel, venal, false, and vain— O but for that!—the soul-distracting pain, Whose unexpected flight makes other grief Sink in the softness of that blest relief, Her spirit ne'er, as now, had risen above The poignant woes of disappointed love; Of that disunion here, stern Fate commands, Who throws her edicts with such ruthless hands! But greater ills remov'd, the less remain Shorn of their pointed stings, and lost their bane. Say, in Louisa's breast no longer glow The inward fires of life-consuming woe; Distant alike from pain's incumbent gloom, And sprightly pleasure's gaily-kindling bloom, The vital powers effuse a softer flame, And with serener beams pervade her frame. Oh, bid him live!—live, to fulfil each part That makes such awful claims upon his heart; And as a husband, as a father, prove Virtuous, and great, as in his filial love! I too shall live!—Health's warmer currents brook, Yet unconfirm'd, upon my faded cheek: Last night their honey'd dews prolong'd my rest, As soft they sprung within my cherish'd breast. O Night! the first exempt from wildest throes Of fever'd pain, that chas'd the short repose, Since my Eugenio's seeming coldness strove, Alas! how much in vain! to quench my love. Yes, I shall live to expiate by a mind Bow'd to its fate, and cheerfully resign'd, The dangerous raslmess, which my peace had thrown On human chance, and errors not my own. Here, to my favourite bower, at rising day, With tranquil step, I bent my purpos'd way; For here I first beheld the graceful youth, And here he promis'd everlasting truth; And here, to thee, my friend, I us'd to grieve, When life could charm no more, nor hope deceive; And here, my long afflicted spirit, freed From that barb'd shaft, on which it wont to bleed, Now bids its soften'd feelings gently flow To her, who draws the deadly sting of woe. Once more these eyes, with smiles of pleasure, hail The vernal beauties of my native vale; The plenteous dews, that in the early ray Gem the light leaf, and tremble on the spray; The fresh cool gales, that undulating pass, With shadowy sweep, along the bending grass.— Now throw the shrubs and trees the lengthen'd shade On the smooth turf distinct!—and now they fade, As sinks the sun, behind a cloud withdrawn, That late unveil'd shone yellow on the lawn. Soft o'er the vale from this my favourite seat, Serene I mark the vagrant beauties fleet; In different lights the changing features trace, Catch the bright form, and paint the shadowy grace. Where the light ash, and browner oak extend, And high in air their mingled branches bend, The mossy bank, beneath their trembling bowers, Arises, fragrant with uncultur'd flowers, That stoop the sweet head o'er the latent spring, And bear the pendant bees, that humming cling. Just gleams the fount—for, curving o'er its brink, The lengthen'd grass, the shining waters drink; Their green arms half its glassy beauties hide, As from beneath them steals the wandering tide, And down the valley careless winds away, While in its streams the glancing sun-beams play. But where the greenwood hill, with arching shade, Opes the light vista up the winding glade, I see a venerable form descend; His slow steps falter as they hither bend. Soft lifts the breeze the locks of silver grey, And gentlest meanings his mild looks convey! Stranger, whoe'er thou art, thy faded face And bending form have many a touching grace. He stops!—I hasten to explore the cause Of that fix'd gaze!—of that impassion'd pause! Upon reading this third epistle to a friend, he observed, that perhaps a comparison of Louisa's own situation with the harder fate of her lover, and her tender pity for the inevitable miseries of such a union, might have been acceptable in the place of the episode of Clairmont, and the description of the bower; but it should be considered, that Louisa wrote under the immediate impression of her extacy to find Eugenio guiltless; that her mind was not sobered enough for reflection. To have investigated the unhappy lot of her lover, must have been a melancholy employment. Eased of an oppressive weight of misery, her exhilarated spirits admit not, so early, any painful ideas. She does not discriminate, she felicitates her destiny. Her sympathy in the fate of her friends grows more lively—she recollects the situation of Clairmont—Joy is naturally loquacious, and she is gratified in relating his story to her Emma. She awakens with new vivacity to the impressions of pleasure, which her mind was accustomed to receive from scenic objects. The propensity to dwell on them prevailed even in the hours of her unhappiness. It is an habit which compares and assimilates the smiling, or the gloomy views of nature, to the internal feelings, and is common to people of a lively imagination. In the exultation of her heart to find her lover yet estimable, Louisa speeds to the bower, so impressed with his image. Its beauties strike her more forcibly than ever, and in this frame of mind she naturally feels delight in painting them. FOURTH EPISTLE. LOUISA TO EMMA. April 25, 1781. Oh! my lov'd Emma, I have much to tell, Since last I sent thee an abrupt farewell; But be the chain of those events regain'd, That led my steps, where awful horrors reign'd, And through the gloom their light of joy reveal'd, By Fate's eclipsing hand so long conceal'd. Rising impatient from the mossy seat, With asking eyes, the stranger guest I meet; He clasps my hand!—Oh! in that look benign, What rays of love, and angel-pity shine! Sweet cordial confidence my bosom cheers, Yet thrilling start the soft spontaneous tears. “What chance, or generous impulse, may I bless, “Thrice gentle stranger, for this kind address; “That thus thou visitest this lonely grove, “And gazest on me with paternal love?” “Ah! sweet Louisa,” the mild form replies; His words slow mingling with the rising sighs, “Behold in me, the source of all the woes “That paled on thy fair cheek the early rose! “But thou art generous, and wilt kindly shed “Forgiveness on Ernesto's aged head; “Yes, thou wilt much allow to sad extremes, “For round thee, as a light, compassion beams!” With pleas'd surprise my beating heart expands: My swifter tears fall copious on his hands; My trembling knee involuntary bends, For deepest reverence with my transport blends: “O Heaven! art thou that being, so rever'd, “In happier days to my charm'd soul endear'd? “Which oft, unconscious of thy form, survey'd “Thy worth, by filial tenderness display'd. “All, all is known!—no selfish murmurs rise, “Nor groans arraign the mandates of the skies; “Nobly Eugenio their high call obey'd!— “Oh! what a wretch were I, should I upbraid, “Because the exalted youth, whose heart I won, “Deserves the blessing, to be born thy son! “Some vagrant drops may fall, some rebel sighs, “Perchance to our divided loves arise; “But banish'd now is misery's ruthless smart, “Though sad, not wretched, my devoted heart; “And oh! since poor Louisa thus obtains “Thy generous love, thy soothing pity gains, “On them each fond regret shall sink to rest, “Nor memory whisper, how she once was blest. “Honour'd Louisa! fair angelic maid, “With every blessing be thy worth repaid! “But time flies rapidly!—the least delay “Ill suits the important message I convey; “An hapless penitent adjures thee fly, “To pardon and receive her dying sigh; “O come with me, Louisa!—at thy gates, “Lo! in the glen, the expecting chariot waits!” Silent—astonish'd—trembling—faint—and pale, My hurried step he hasten'd to the vale; And soon, as seated by his side I rode, Thus, from his lip, Emira's story flow'd. ‘When to the altar my unhappy son ‘Led the gay bride, whom all unsought he won, ‘Pensive his eye, and serious was his air; ‘Though, with attentive, and respectful care, ‘He strove to hide the sorrows of his soul, ‘But could not oft their bursting sigh controul, ‘Bright, and adorn'd, as came the high-born maid, ‘In every lavish elegance array'd. ‘Yet oft I saw, that inauspicious morn, ‘From smother'd consciousness, the transient scorn ‘Cast lurid flame at times, amid the joy ‘That glow'd voluptuous in her ardent eye, ‘When she perceiv'd, no ray of fond desire ‘Met her warm glance, or authoris'd its fire; ‘Saw deep-felt anguish in her bridegroom prove ‘The power supreme of violated love; ‘And oft his notice, courteous, yet constrain'd, ‘Eager she sought; receiving it, disdain'd; ‘And still each day increas'd the vain chagrin, ‘And wak'd new sallies of malicious spleen; ‘The pensive homage of a wounded mind, ‘Though grateful, sad, and, without ardour, kind, ‘Seem'd to reproach those eyes, as powerless grown, ‘Whose glance, she deem'd, might make the world her own. ‘Unjust Emira! that could'st hope to gain ‘Love's glowing homage from an heart in pain; ‘Thou should'st have sooth'd the involuntary smart, ‘And with his friendship satisfied thy heart; ‘Thus sweet, and gentle, thou hadst quickly won ‘That grateful tribute from my generous son; ‘But well he knew, thy vain ill-govern'd mind, ‘Nor soft compassion knew, nor love refin'd; ‘So unregretful saw her wasted hours ‘Resign'd to dissipation's restless powers; ‘Yet wish'd those powers a kind relief might prove ‘To the pain'd sense of disappointed love; ‘And sometimes hop'd, the strong maternal claims ‘Might lead her light desires to softer aims, ‘When a sweet cherub-daughter blest her arms, ‘Whose features promis'd all her mother's charms; ‘But no maternal tenderness she shares, ‘The gay Emira scorns its gentle cares. ‘And when to pleasures, frivolous and vain, ‘He saw succeed, a mad licentious train; ‘Play, ruinously high, and dark intrigue ‘Prompt the wild wish, and form the baneful league, ‘How oft has he adjur'd her to reflect, ‘What priceless peace her wild pursuits neglect! ‘On me propitious Heaven the power bestow'd ‘To cancel the vast debt my fortunes ow'd ‘To proud Emira,—for my lucky sails ‘Return'd, rich freighted, from Hispania's vales; ‘Those sails, whose venture rash, and long delay, ‘With all a bankrupt's misery crossed my way. ‘Now many a smiling chance combin'd to raise, ‘Above the level of my fairest days, ‘That wealth, whose dreadful and impending fall ‘In one wide ruin had involv'd us all, ‘But that Emira, in that fateful hour, ‘Snatch'd my devoted credit from its power; ‘And duteous, noble, dear Eugenio stood, ‘A youthful victim to his father's good. ‘Yet when I saw, that mean unfeeling pride ‘Rul'd the vain bosom of the worthless bride, ‘My soul rejoic'd, with interest to repay ‘The heavy debt of that disastrous day; ‘For what idea can more painful rise, ‘Than much to owe, where owing we despise? ‘One scene, alas! my heart can ne'er forget, ‘Nor memory paint it without keen regret, ‘That in the female breast, so form'd to prove ‘The sweet refinements of maternal love, ‘Disdain, and guilty pleasure, should controul, ‘And to its yearnings indurate the soul. ‘Consummate from her toilette's anxious task, ‘Emira, hastening to the midnight mask, ‘The apartment enter'd, where Eugenio stood, ‘And near me lean'd, in deeply musing mood. ‘My folding arms their rosy infant prest ‘To the fond throbbings of a grandsire's breast. ‘She, with the tones of petulant reproach, ‘And neck averted, call'd her tardy coach. ‘I mark'd Eugenio's disapproving sigh, ‘As the licentious vestment caught his eye; ‘The lofty turban, from whose surface rais'd, ‘Glitter'd the silver plume, the diamond blaz'd; ‘The snowy veil, in soft disorder thrown; ‘The bosom, rising from the loosen'd zone; ‘And limbs, by golden muslin ill conceal'd, ‘Whose clinging folds their perfect form reveal'd. ‘With heart-felt pain the injur'd husband saw ‘The fair thus scorn decorum's guardian law; ‘Saw all that decent dress, that modest pride, ‘“Which doubles ev'ry charm it seeks to hide,” ‘Once the bright dame of Britain's loveliest boast, ‘In the seraglio's wanton inmate lost! ‘Seizing her struggling hand, Eugenio tries ‘To warn the fair devoted, ere she flies, ‘Where infamy in silent ambush strays ‘Amidst the antic throng, the midnight blaze. “Oh! is it thus, he said, a wedded dame “Lights the loose profligate's disgraceful flame? “If'gainst an husband's claim thy heart is sear'd, “By Heaven establish'd, and by man rever'd, “To that, if thy high spirit scorns to bend, “Yet, O Emira! hear me as thy friend! “Snatch thy bright youth, and all its countless charms, “From a dread ambush of o'erwhelming harms, “Whose demon-tribe some evils shall impart, “To reach and wring the most obdurate heart! “How will that haughty, that aspiring mind, “Which claims the incessant homage of mankind; “Sees to those graces, flattering crowds avow, “Proud rank unbend, and rival beauty bow; “How will it bear to change this soft respect, “For studied insolence, and rude neglect? “The nod familiar of the coxcomb throng? “Thy name the theme of their lascivious song; “And from the high-bred dames, that now excite, “And share the revels of thy dangerous night, “Who, when detection's livid spots arise, “Will studious shun, affecting to despise; “Canst thou the unbending knee's cold insult bear, “Their smile of malice, and their vacant stare? “Shafts, which wrong'd virtue only can sustain, “And rise superior to the unjust disdain.” ‘Thus while he pour'd, to check this rash career, ‘The startling questions on her wounded ear, ‘Frowning she strove to disengage her hand, ‘And fly the just reproach, the firm demand; ‘While sullen brows, and flashes of disdain, ‘Too plainly proved the awful challenge vain. ‘Then striving, from a softer cause, to impart ‘The virtuous wish to her misguided heart, ‘A father's fondness melting in his look, ‘From my embrace the smiling babe he took; ‘Exclaiming, as in all its touching charms ‘He gave it to her half-unwilling arms; “Alas!

Through the remaining way our mutual sighs, From awe-struck thought, in solemn silence rise. Shuddering we now draw near the house of death, And find yet stays the intermitting breath. What agitated dread my bosom tears, When pausing we ascend the silent stairs!— As we approach the slowly-opening door!— As my pain'd senses, horror-chill'd, explore The dim apartment, where the lessen'd light Gives the pale sufferer to my fearful sight! The matchless grace of that consummate frame Withering beneath the fever's scorching flame. Outstretched and wan, with labouring breath she lies, Closing in palsied lids her quivering eyes. Eugenio's hand lock'd in her clasping hands, As hush'd and mournful by her couch he stands! Horror, and pity, mingled traces flung, Which o'er his form, like wintry shadows, hung; Yet, on my entrance in that dreary room, A gleam of joy darts through their awful gloom! Oh! what a moment!—my Eugenio's face!— Alas!—how faded its once glowing grace! Past hours of woe on his pale cheek I read, In eyes whose beams, like waning stars, recede! Faintly the sound of that known voice I hear, “Oh, my Louisa!” scarce it meets my ear, Lest the imperfect slumber should be found Chas'd by the check'd involuntary sound. But clear the senses of the dying seem, Like the expiring taper's flashing beam. Scarce audibly though breath'd, Louisa's name Emira hears, and her enfeebled frame, With sudden powerless effort, strives to raise; But, sinking back, her eyes, in eager gaze, Are fix'd on mine,—what anguish in their beams! O conscious guilt! how dreadful thy extremes! The chill numb hands, whence deadly dews had broke, Snatch'd from her lord's, when starting she awoke, Now, as they seem unable to extend, Softly I take, as o'er her couch I bend; She turns away, opprest by thought severe, And steeps her pillow in the bitter tear. Alas! be calm! be comforted! I cried. “Do you too pardon?”—shrilly she replied, Bending again on me that burning ray, Whose heat no contrite waters could allay— “Then, dear Louisa, peaceful shall I die, “Since hallow'd thus my last—remorseful sigh; “But Oh! 'tis dread—when memory displays “The guilt-stain'd retrospect of vanish'd days! “The secret—selfish joy—which hail'd the blow, “That laid Ernesto's prosperous fortunes low; “Sever'd those hands—whose glowing hearts were join'd, “The sacred union of the kindred mind.— “Heaven re-unites them!—and the wretch removes, “That impious rose between their plighted loves; “Who not content to blast their sweet increase, “And arm—Eugenio's virtue—'gainst his peace, “Added”—But now, from feebleness, or shame, A deadly faintness sickens through her frame. Reviving shortly—“I would fain,” she cries, “Ere everlasting darkness close these eyes, “Intreat of that kind spirit—sweet, and mild, “Its future—generous goodness—to my child. “Love her, Louisa—love her—I implore, “When lost Emira—wounds thy peace no more! “Oh! gently foster in her opening youth, “The seeds of virtue—honour—faith—and truth, “For thy Eugenio's sake!—who gave her birth, “And gave—I trust—the temper of his worth! “And when—on his lov'd knees—my infant climbs, “Adjure him—to forget her mother's crimes! “I know thou wilt!—I feel thy heart expand, “In the dear pressure—of that gentle hand. “O ye wrong'd pair! in the last awful morn, “When my stain'd soul at the eternal bourn “Shall trembling stand—her final doom to hear, “She less shall dread—to meet the injur'd there! “Congenial mercy—she may hope to prove, “From the offended powers—of truth—and love!” While yet these interrupted accents hung, Faint on the rigid lip, and faltering tongue, The stiffening spasm, the suffocating breath, Gave dread presage of near approaching death.— Now roll the eyes in fierce and restless gaze! Now on their wildness steals the ghastly glaze! Till o'er her form the shadowy horrors spread The dim suffusion that involves the Dead. Thus wealth, and rank, and all their gorgeous train, The proud that madden, and ensnare the vain; Youth's frolic grace, and beauty's radiant bloom, Sink, in the dreary silence of the tomb; But oh! rejoice with me, that hope's blest beam Threw o'er the dark abyss one trembling gleam! For thy Louisa—Words can ill impart How dear the comforts eddying round her heart! How soft the joy, by sorrow's shading hand Touch'd into charms more exquisitely bland! Or paint Eugenio's transports as they rise, More sweet for generous pity's mingled sighs; Sweet above all, from the exulting pride Of self-approving virtue, strongly tried. Applauding Conscience, yes! to thee 'tis given, To inspire a joy, that antedates our heaven! Thus, on Moria's consecrated height, Flow'd the obedient patriarch's fond delight, When o'er the filial breast, his faith to seal, On high had gleam'd the sacrificing steel; Thus flow'd, when at the voice, divinely mild, His raptur'd hands unbound his only child! O come, my Emma!—yet thou ne'er hast seen Embodied virtue in Eugenio's mien; Grace, grandeur, truth, and tenderness combin'd, The liberal effluence of the polish'd mind! And for more generous pleasures than we prove, The bliss surveying of the friends we love, Sure we must wait, till angels shall impart Their own perfection to the expanded heart! Haste then to share our blessings, as they glow Through the receding shades of heaviest woe!— As spring's fair morn, with calm, and dewy light, Breaks through the weary, long, and stormy night, So now, as through the vale of life we stray, The Star of Joy relumes, and leads us on our way! SONG OF ROXANA. This, and the ensuing and very superior poem, the Song of Zillia, are from the under-written prose translations, of strains, sung by dancing nymphs in Persia, at the Grand Vizier's feast, at which a gentleman was present, who made these prose translations. SONG OF ROXANA, A NAME SIGNIFYING SPLENDOUR. I. “When, O my beloved Lord, will thou return? My heart's “idol, my soul's treasure! when wilt thou return to bless the “eyes of thy Roxana?—In vain do I look for thee—my eyelids “ache in watching for thy approach. II. “The sofa for my beloved is dressed with garlands of jessamine. “I have strewed it with the beauties of my garden, “and perfumed it with the oil of roses. III. “My chamber is scented with the rich essence of the Latura. “Hasten then, my beloved!—every thing is prepared “for thy reception. Gladden the heart of thine handmaid by “thy presence, thou first of her joys, chief happiness of her “soul!” A PERSIAN POEM. When, to thy own Roxana's arms, Wilt thou, my lovely lord, return? When on thy blaze of youthful charms Shall these desiring glances turn? Anxious I wait thee in the spicy grove;— My eye-balls ache with watching for my love. The sofa, for my lord's repose, Is scattered o'er with jess' mine wreaths; There every flower, that Persia knows, Voluptuous odour breathes; While in full drops descend the roseate oils, Press'd from the glowing Orient's ripen'd spoils. Light on my couch the virgins shed Zest, from the rich Latura drawn; And all in soft profusion spread, Embath'd in sweets, the snowy lawn. Haste then, O haste, to glad these longing eyes, Pride of my life, and transport of my joys! THE SONG OF ZILLIA. THE SONG OF ZILLIA. “O! thou lamp of my life, my first, my only love, in vain “do I now call upon thee. Thou art afar off, and hearest not “the voice of thy Zillia,—once the most favoured of thy Seraglio. “Shawls of Cassimir, and robes of Irva, were presents from “my Lord—such gay attire has no charms for Zillia—They “cannot make her happier. “Thy palaces, thy baths, and thy gardens, afford me ho “pleasure—Take them back—they no longer delight me. “The mango and pomegranate tempt me in vain—for the “fragrance of flowers, and odours of spices, or the songs of “minstrels, I have no relish. “But return, O my Lord, to thine handmaid!—come back “to her arms!—restore to her thy heart, and every pleasure “will be renewed—she will be the happiest of women. Lamp of thy tender Zillia's vital day, Throb of her heart, her first, her only love, Incessant as her steps disorder'd stray Along the vacant,—silent,—lonely grove, Once the selected of thy beauteous train, Calls her far wandering Lord, but calls in vain! Ah, my loved Sultan! often hast thou bound Golconda's diamonds on my youthful brow! But dim the plum'd and jewel'd turban found In faded eyes, that weep a broken vow. Lost is the gem, that shames Peruvia's store, Thy heart, my Lord—restore it!—O, restore! Ye robes of Irva, ye embroider'd veils, Gifts of my Lord, this hapless breast that bind, Ah! when the piercing dart of grief assails, Can ye defend my love-devoted mind? From suns ye screen, or when chill dews prevail, Not from love's fire, or absence' icy gale. Ye gilded palaces, ye marble cells, In which the tepid fountain sleeps serene, Ye bowers of roses, where the night-bird tells His amorous story to the floral queen, Ah! what avail ye? powerless to atone The heart estrang'd, that once was all my own! These gay pavilions, these odorous bowers, So long the joy of thy distinguish'd maid! They charm no more;—no more, with tempting powers, Pomegranates redden through their leafy shade; Unheard the minstrel trills the liquid strain, And Persia lights her fragrant gums in vain. But let my Sultan seek these longing arms, His eyes shall give my darkened gems to shine; These gay retreats assume their wonted charms, And all the bliss of vanish'd days be mine. Blest, above women, shall the fair-one prove, Who twines for him the purple wreaths of love! EASTERN ODE TRANSLATED FROM THE PROSE OF SIR WILLIAM JONES. “Thou hearest the song of the nightingale, that the vernal “season approaches. Spring has spread a bower of joy “in every grove, and the almond sheds her silver blossoms. Be “cheerful, be full of mirth, for the spring passeth away, it will “not last. “The groves and hills are covered with all sort of flowers. “A pavilion of roses, the seat of Pleasure, is raised in the “garden. Who knows which of us shall be alive when the “season ends? Be cheerful, he full of mirth, for the spring “passeth away, it will not last. “The edge of the bower is filled with the light of Ahmed. “Amongst the plants, the fortunate tulips represent their “companion. Come, O people of Mahomed, this is the season “of merriment! Be cheerful, &amp;c. “Again the dew glitters on the leaves of the lily, like the “Water of a bright scymitar. The dew drops fall through the “air on gardens of roses—Listen to me—listen to me, if thou “desirest to be delighted! Be cheerful, &amp;c. “The roses and lilies are like the cheeks of beautiful maids, “in whose ears pearls hang, like drops of dew. Deceive not “thyself with thinking that these charms will have a long duration. “Be cheerful, &amp;c. “Tulips, roses, and anemonies appear in the garden. The “showers and sun-beams, like sharp lancets, tinge the banks “with the colour of blood. Spend the day agreeably with “thy friend! “The time is past when the plants were sick, and the rosebud “hung its drooping head on its bosom. The season is “come, in which the rocks and mountains are covered with “tulips. Be cheerful, &amp;c. “Each morning the clouds shed gems over the rose-garden. “The breath of the gales is full of Tartarian musk—Be not “neglectful of thy duty, through too great love of the world! “The sweetness of the bowers have made the air so fragrant, “that the dew is changed into rose-water. The sky “spreads a pavilion of bright clouds over the garden. Be “cheerful, &amp;c. “Whoever thou art, know, that the black gusts of the Autumn “had seized the garden—but the king of the world appears, “dispensing pleasure to all. In his reign the happy “cup-bearer desired, and obtains the flowing wine. Be “cheerful, &amp;c. “By these strains I hope to celebrate this delightful valley. “May they be a memorial to its inhabitants, and remind them “of this assembly, and of those fair maids. Be cheerful, be “full of mirth, for the spring passeth away, it will not last.” Hark, the sweet Nightingale! how soft she hails The blooming season, and its balmy gales! Wild floats her song amid expanding bowers, And the young almond sheds the silver flowers. Then let us all be happy while we may, For soon the inspiring spring shall pass away! A thousand florets deck each hill and grove, And the rose flaunts in pleasure's gay alcove. Ah! ere pale Winter, paler fate may breathe The deadly gale, that blasts our vital wreath! Hope not, while youth and health their treasures bring, Life's rapid hours will pause upon their wing! The light of Beauty glitters round the bowers, For lovely as my Ahmed, shine the flowers; Each varied tulip emulates my fair, Her glowing cheek, dark eye, and golden hair. Soon, like their hues, her beauties must decay; We live to love, in youth's resplendent day! Again the dews, from leaves of lilies, glance, Bright as the watry polish of the lance. Their moisture soft the clust'ring roses share, It falls, from floating clouds, through balmy air. Hear me! O hear me, if ye mean to prove In youth's short hours, the joys of Spring, and Love! Gay are the flowers, as Persia's nymphs appear When the pearl trembles in the fair-one's ear. They, like the form they emulate, array'd, Shine but to wane, and blossom but to fade. Too fair to last, expect their swift decay, And taste the transient sweetness while you may! Their beauteous orbs anemonies disclose, Gay tulips flourish, and the splendid rose. Like spears, This simile, in the original, of the sunbeams darting through the rains, and tinging the wet banks with the colour of blood, to sharp lancets; and the preceding one, of dew upon lilies, to the watry lustre of polished steel, are each peculiarly in the spirit of the oriental poets, whose comparisons are bold and sublime, but rather broad and general, than answering at all points; yet not the less beautiful for such want of precision. Surprise, to find these two characteristic similes omitted in Sir W.Jones' versification of this ode, induced the author of these poems to give the above translation. at times, the sun-beams pierce the rains, Tinging the weltering bank with sanguine stains. This day, while fast those vernal showers descend, Allot to Wisdom, Fancy, and thy friend! Past is the time, the wintry days are fled When the dim rose-bud hung its shrivell'd head; The time is come when rocks are crown'd with flowers, And the wild mountains vie with cultur'd bowers. Glad let us be since e'en rude rocks are gay, And wear the gaudy wreaths of Love and May. Now her moist gems the early morning throws In the fresh bosom of the opening rose. Shall avarice draw thee from our blooming vales Whose musky perfumes linger on the gales? What groveling cares do heaps of gold create! Let love and beauty rule our softer fate! Thy garden sweets as high the light winds drew, They chang'd to rose-water the falling dew. The gilded clouds a rich pavilion form, Without the sable spot, that threats the storm; Then shall our temples one dim shade display? Ye sunny smiles, adorn them while ye may! Late round the bowers the winds of Autumn mourn'd, But soon, and bright, the solar Lord return'd. Of him the cup-bearer desir'd the vine, And flows, from purple orbs, the rosy wine! Free bleed the grapes, and freely flows my song, That gaily tells what joys to youth belong! O! live my song, that future years may hail These charming maids, and this enchanting vale! The charming maids have listen'd to my lays, And sure the verse will live, they deign to praise! Since though it tells how short the vernal day, It bids us live to pleasure while we may. DAPHNE's COYNESS ACCOUNTED FOR. Fontenelle observes that Daphne fled from Apollo lest he should give her physic—The author formed her bagatclle upon that hint. O! stay, lovely Nymph, while you hear who 'tis woos ye, That the blithe god of wit, and of music, pursues ye, Arrest thy fleet foot, that hastes wildly along, Nor fly from the Lord of Verse, Physic, and Song! At that dreadful word, Physic, she doubles her speed, She springs through the thicket, she bounds o'er the mead, For when fancy should paint a warm youth to have kiss'd her, It presented, O, horrid! a bolus, and blister! So, at length, to escape from the Doctor's advances, She commits her soft beauties to roots, and to branches. Dull God!—had'st thou boasted, to vanquish her scorn, Of thy locks hyacinthine, that burnish the morn, Of the grace of those limbs, that can curb thy fierce horses, And firm thro' the Zodiac direct their rash courses; Hadst thou urg'd her to turn, and to gaze on those eyes, The blessing of earth, and the boast of the skies, Talk'd less of thy knowledge, and more of thy charms, Would the nymph have preferr'd a cold tree to thy arms? No, no! 'twas the thought, and the dread of a potion, Which made her, thus oddly, renounce loco-motion. Ah! ne'er, but for that, had the coy tree of fame Stood, trembling and silent, by Arethuse' stream; And the Bards, who have gain'd by this amorous quarrel, Might have worn the dull bays, but had miss'd the bright laurel. VERSES TO Mr. HAYLEY, CONCERNING UNPUBLISHED REMAINS OF OSSIAN. Mr Hayley had heard that Mr Boothby (since, Sir Brooke Boothby) was in possession of such morceaus, and applied to him on the subject. The above lines were written extempore after supper, by Sir Brooke, and the author of this Miscellany, about the year 1784. Here are verses that greet you in strange motley dress, Gay Boothby's arch fragment ek'd out by A.S. “Sweet Bard of these times, whose poems are verse, “No fragment have I of Gallic, or Erse, “Of old Ossian's old raiment if more we must see, “Not a rag of his cloak e'er descended to me; “And, if I durst say so, I dont much repine, “For these Epics in prose are no favourites of mine; “'Tis the sun, who obscur'd in a mist, dimly gleams, “Depriv'd of his ardour, and shorn of his beams; “'Tis the glimmering twilight, where all is confus'd, “And the uncertain sight with vain phantoms abus'd; “'Tis”—Yes, I'll tell you what 'tis, gentle Sir, on my word, It is effrontery matchless, and worse than absurd, When on crack'd bells of wit your few changes you ring all, When pigmies, like you, dare attack Giant Fingal. Immers'd in Low Latin, Sir Brooke Boothby, then Mr Boothby, had been recently engaged in translating Linnæus, whose herbal titles are often promiscuously taken from the generally harsh names of the Continental professors. High German, and Dutch, On the claims of the Poet how dar'd you to touch? And to write too in rhyme your impertinent letter! Pity those who judge others dont know themselves better! Pray, Sir, when you call on your elegant muse, Is it Danish, or Swedish, or Polish, you use? Hedwigia, Plants called after Dutch and German botanists. Rotbollio, Bauxbamia, Serckæa, Wackendorffia, Zuzyigium, Schwalbea, Zægæa? Such horrible jargon the Muses would drive all, As the smell of the fish did Tobit's black rival: Yet that was a simile vended in haste, For 'tis thou art the fiend on the bride-bed of Taste, And ne'er shall that virgin an happy wife be, Till Genius, her bridegroom, shall drive away thee. To consummate their loves in the temple of Fame, That bridegroom, from Scotia's bleak scenery, came; Strong in youth, though four centuries o'er him had roll'd, For Genius poetic can never grow old: Rich in beauty, tho' sombre the hue of each grace, For the sweetness is shaded that smiles on his face; His harp the free hand of Sublimity strung, And Pathos distill'd all her balm on his tongue; Mighty Nature his pencil so exquisite made, That it softens each light, as it mellows each shade; Brings the object so full and distinct on the eye, As shines the green vale, or as darkens the sky, That rapt we can suffer no thought intervene, But stand in the desert, and view the lone scene. Heretic decisions thus bronzing thy brow, Assuredly, Boothby, the demon art thou; The dose Asmodean I long to see given, Till from chamber poetic thou fairly art driven; So for Ossian's high claim, when you, demon-like, mock it, May a shoal of rank herrings be stuff'd in your pocket! WRITTEN IN AUTUMN, 1784, AFTER A VISIT TO COLTON, THE SEAT OF WILLIAM GILBERT, ESQ. IN STAFFORDSHIRE. Sweet were the joys, that o'er my spirit flow'd In kind and generous Gilbert's blest abode; From Nature, and from him, the calm retreat Boasts all that joins the lovely, and the great. Charm'd from the track, which winds the mountain's brow, Peering so proudly on a world below, I mark'd the circling heights, that bare, and pale, Zone the rich bosom of his sylvan vale; Where darksome woods rise murmuring to the gales, Robe the near hills, and sink into the dales; With pomp theatric many a mountain crown, And screen the bulging rock's terrific frown. How soft, around their sombrous basis drawn, Shines the green bosom of the sloping lawn! While, 'mid their dusky labyrinths widely spread, Swells the illumin'd bosom of the mead; And, skirting its light edge in waving rows, Ting'd with autumnal gold, the umbrage flows. What wizard dells! how tangled, dark, and steep! Down whose rough sides the foaming waters leap, And with meand'ring course, and tuneful wail, Run silvering onward through the gloomy dale! How smooth those cliffs, that meet the noon-tide ray, Rounding in gilt convexity away! How clear the lake, that on the green hill sleeps! How full the shrubs, that fringe its crystal deeps! Whose Dryads o'er the liquid mirror lean, Braid their light locks, and view their graceful mien. Still, as, supported by his arm, I stray'd, Climb'd the bold hill, or trac'd the silent glade, Listening I heard his honour'd lips explain The laws there given to Nature's lavish reign; The just restraints, that chasten'd wanton art, And prov'd his taste ingenuous as his heart. But Gilbert's virtues claim an holier meed Than praises warbled from the doric reed; Since not alone with beauty's robe he veils The sterile rocks, and drains the marshy dales, His cares Alluding to his benevolent efforts in the senate, for the better regulation of the Poor's laws. the desert wilds of life explore, He lives the friend, and guardian of the poor; Seeks, with unwearied aim, their lasting weal, Their kind warm shelter, and their wholesome meal. Deep in the lone recesses of the wood, As leaning, late in pensive mood, he stood, He mark'd the brook, descending from on high, In one straight channel tire the earnest eye, And, in the thirst for scenic beauty, sigh'd To see its course in numerous streams divide. High on its brow The accidental fall of part of a rock, in one of the Colton glens, auticipated Mr Gilbert's design of dividing the straight channel of a stream, which fell down the declivity, by throwing into it stony fragments. the rock's stern Genius stood, And struck the crag, that beetled o'er the flood, It falls!—huge fragments thunder on the waves! The startled stream in many a current raves; Throws her white foam amid the darkling glades, And rapid flashes through entangled shades. Thus, at benignant Gilbert's wish to expand The streams of Charity with skilful hand, May giant Power suspend each ruthless claim, Revere his virtue, and assist its aim; Strike Law's stern rock, till falling statutes force The tides of bounty into happier course! With me not only shall remain the trace Of his lov'd Colton's bold, romantic grace, But of each rational and pure delight, That cheer'd its walls with intellectual light; Those smiles, awakening with resistless power, The quick affections of the social hour, Beam'd from her looks, who bounds his joys on earth, Choice of his heart, and partner of his worth! COLEBROOK DALE. Scene of superfluous grace, and wasted bloom, O, violated Colebrook! in an hour, To beauty unpropitious and to song, The Genius of thy shades, by Plutus brib'd, Amid thy grassy lanes, thy woodwild glens, Thy knolls and bubbling wells, thy rocks, and streams. Slumbers!—while tribes fuliginous invade The soft, romantic, consecrated scenes; Haunt of the wood-nymph, who with airy step, In times long vanish'd, through thy pathless groves Rang'd;—while the pearly-wristed Naiads lean'd, Braiding their light locks o'er thy crystal flood, Shadowy and smooth. What, though to vulgar eye Invisible, yet oft the lucid gaze Of the rapt Bard, in every dell and glade Beheld them wander;—saw, from the clear wave Emerging, all the watry sisters rise, Weaving the aqueous lily, and the flag, In wreaths fantastic, for the tresses bright Of amber-hair'd Sabrina.—Now we view Their fresh, their fragrant, and their silent reign Usurpt by Cyclops;—hear, in mingled tones, Shout their throng'd barge, their pond'rous engines clang Through thy coy dales; while red the countless fires, With umber'd flames, “Each battle sees the other's umber'd face.”—Shakespear. bicker on all thy hills, Dark'ning the Summer's sun with columns large Of thick, sulphureous smoke, which spread, like palls, That screen the dead, upon the sylvan robe Of thy aspiring rocks; pollute thy gales, And stain thy glassy waters.—See, in troops, The dusk artificers, with brazen throats, Swarm on thy cliffs, and clamour in thy glens, Steepy and wild, ill suited to such guests. Ah! what avails it to the poet's sense, That the large stores of thy metallic veins Gleam over Europe; transatlantic shores Illumine wide;—are chang'd in either Ind For all they boast, hot Ceylon's breathing spice; Peruvian gums; Brazilia's golden ore; And odorous gums, which Persia's white-rob'd seer, With warbled orisons, on Ganges' brink, Kindles, when first his Mithra's living ray Purples the Orient.—Ah! the traffic rich, With equal 'vantage, might Britannia send From regions better suited to such aims, Than from her Colebrook's muse-devoted vales, To far resounding Birmingham, the boast, The growing London of the Mercian realm; Thence to be wafted o'er our subject seas To every port;—yes, from that town, the mart Of rich inventive Commerce. Science there Leads her enlighten'd sons, to guide the hand Of the prompt artist, and with great design Plan the vast engine, whose extended arms, Heavy and huge, on the soft-seeming breath Of the hot steam, rise slowly;—till, by cold Condens'd, it leaves them soon, with clanging roar, Down, down, to fall precipitant. Nor yet Her fam'd Triumvirate, Messrs. Bolton, Watt, and Kier. in every land Known and rever'd, not they the only boast, Of this our second London; the rapt sage, Doctor Priestley, then residing at Birmingham, and the event wholly unforeseen, which drove him thence in the year 1791, with so much loss of property, and induced him to quit his native country. It is to be regretted that he drew upon himself the hatred of the hierarchy, and the fury of the populace, by quitting his philosophic studies for the thorny paths of schismatic controversy, and republican politics. Who trac'd the viewless Aura's subtle breath Through all its various powers, there bending feeds The lamp of Science with the richest oils Which the arch-chemist, Genius, knows to draw From Nature's stores, or latent, or reveal'd. While neighbouring cities waste the fleeting hours, Careless of art and knowledge, and the smile Of every Muse, expanding Birmingham, Illum'd by intellect, as gay in wealth, Commands her aye-accumulating walls, From month to month, to climb the adjacent hills; Creep on the circling plains, now here, now there, Divergent—change the hedges, thickets, trees, Upturn'd, disrooted, into mortar'd piles, The street elongate, and the statelier square. So, with intent transmutant, Chemists bruise The shrinking leaves and flowers, whose steams saline, Congealing swift on the recipient's sides, Shoot into crystals;—and the night-frost thus Insidious creeping on the watry plain, Wave after wave incrusts, till liquid change To solid, and support the volant foot. Warn'd by the Muse, if Birmingham should draw, In future years, from more congenial climes Her massy ore, her labouring sons recall, And sylvan Colebrook's winding vales restore To beauty and to song, content to draw From unpoetic scenes her rattling stores, Massy and dun; if, thence supplied, she fail, Britain, to glut thy rage commercial, see Grim Wolverhampton lights her smouldering fires, And Sheffield, smoke-involv'd; dim where she stands Circled by lofty mountains, which condense Her dark and spiral wreatlis to drizzling rains, Frequent and sullied; as the neighbouring hills Ope their deep veins, and feed her cavern'd flames; While, to her dusky sister, Wolverhampton has the greatest part of her iron from Ketley, a dreary and barren wold in her vicinity. Ketley yields, From her long-desolate, and livid breast, The ponderous metal. No aerial forms On Sheffield's arid moor, The East-moor, near Sheffield, which is dreary, though the rest of the country surrounding that town, s very fine. or Ketley's heath, E'er wove the floral crowns, or smiling stretch'd The shelly scepter;—there no Poet rov'd To catch bright inspirations. Blush, ah, blush, Thou venal Genius of these outraged groves, And thy apostate head with thy soil'd wings Veil!—who hast thus thy beauteous charge resign'd To habitants ill-suited; hast allow'd Their rattling forges, and their hammer's din, And hoarse, rude throats, to fright the gentle train, Dryads, and fair hair'd In Milton's Comus we find the plural of Naiad made three syllables, thus “Amid the flowery kirtled Naiades.” And the old pastoral poet, Browne, so pluralizes the word Nereid, thus “Call to a dance the fair Nereides.” Naiades;—the song, Once loud as sweet, of the wild woodland choir To silence;—disenchant the poet's spell, And to a gloomy Erebus transform The destined rival of Tempean vales. INDEPENDENT INDUSTRY TRUE VIRTUE. ADDRESSED TO Mr WILLIAM NEWTON, WITH THE AUTHOR'S FORMER PUBLICATIONS. William Newton's father was a carpenter in the Peak of Derbyshire, with a large family. He was too ignorant to give his son any literary advantages, and too indigent to procure them for him. A dame-school, where a little writing was taught, formed the boundary of our minstrel's education. He worked at his father's trade, and early became so ingenious, skilful, and industrious, as to be employed by a few families of consequence in the neighbourhood. On those occasions, it has been said, he used to examine books, accidentally left in the apartments where he worked. They a wakened into sensibility and expansion the internal fires of his spirit. Every species of fine writing engaged his attention, but poetry enchanted him. From that period all the earning of his mechanic industry, which he could prudently spare, were expended in purchasing books. Mr Cunninghame, an ingenious and lettered clergyman in the Peak, accidentally discovered this flower of the desert. A reserved disposition, modest and unobtrusive, had over his talents cast a veil, which few had capacity to pierce. Newton was employed, not only to execute, but to construct machines for the Derbyshire cotton-mills, and he had been previously retained as one of the master-workmen in the Duke of Devonshire's splendid buildings at Buxton. Early in life he married a woman of his own rank, and is known to be a kind husband, a tender father, and, in all respects, a worthy man. When the author was with her father at his living in the Peak, in the summer 1783, Mr Cunninghame told her, that Newton had a considerable number of well-chosen books, religious, philosophic, historic, and poetic. It was then that Mr C? first introduced him to her, as the minstrel of her native mountains. Mr Newton is not ill looking, but has nothing in his appearance beyond the decent and the clean, till conversation on ingenious subjects lights up his countenance. When the first embarrassments were past, which arose from a modest consciousness that he had not the manners of polished life, he conversed, though in the accent of his country, on various themes, with perspicuity and taste, and in perfectly good language; upon the books he had read, the striking scenery of the few countries he had seen, and the nature of his own destiny, perceptions, and acquirements. The ease and elegance of his epistolary style are most extraordinary, his birth and uneducated youth considered.—The following are extracts from a letter of thanks, which the author received from him on being presented with the compositions she had sent into the world. “All that your pensive, your lonely friend can return for “this unmerited kindness, are the warm effusions of a grateful “heart. My walk along the vale of life, has not been through “a wilderness of sweets. Your having scattered in my path “flowers of so agreeable an odour, culled from the bowers of “the muses, will lighten, in many an irksome hour, the weight “of manual labour. Since I received this testimony of your “regard, hope and joy have aided the hands of the mechanic. “Sublime and beautiful objects, which I used to view with “melancholy languor, have now acquired the most animating “charms in my sight. As a warm sun-beam dispels the heavy “dews, and raises the head of the drooping field-flower, so has “your kind attention dispersed the clouds, which were cast “about me by adverse fortune. I have lately added to my “little collection of poetry, the works of that sublime bard, “and learned and ingenious critic, Mr Hayley; and I now “live in the midst of charming Monsaldale, whose graces you “have so faithfully described in the poem, which you have “been so good to address to me. Last week Mr Cunninghame “found me in this lovely valley, surrounded by wheels, springs, “and other mechanical implements. To his imagination they “appeared as the effect of magic, and he called me Prospero.” To have found, in the compositions of a laborious villager, some bright sparks of native genius, amid the dross of prosaic vulgarity, had been pleasing, though perhaps not wonderful; but the elegance and harmony of Newton's writings, both in prose and verse, are miraculous, when it is remembered that till Mr Cunninghame distinguished him, he had associated only with the unlettered vulgar. Monsaldale is the loveliest of the Derbyshire vallies. If its features are less sublime than those of Dovedale, they are more soft and smiling, and not less picturesque. Strange that Monsaldale should seldom be included in the chart traced out for the curious, who mean to explore the wonders, and the beauties of Derbyshire! The following stanzas are extracted from a poem, written by Newton, and addressed to the author of this miscellany. They were composed during the dangerous walk, which his business obliged him to take through the severe winter 1785, between the little town of Tideswell, where his family resided, and Monsaldale, where he was employed in the cotton-mills. He took this walk every morning, before the day broke, and every evening after it had closed, over the bleak and mountainous tracts of Tideswell Moor, always covered with snow when the winters are rigid. “Scarce through the sod my cot aspires, “Scarce shelter'd from the weltering storm, “Yet here the muses ring their lyres, “When pealing rains the night deform. “Far from that cot, each social friend, “And every dear, domestic tie, “My pensive hours I'm doom'd to spend, “And oft to heave the bitter sigh. “For me pale Slander taints the gale, “Suspicion spreads her murky snares, “Disease's dreaded shaft assails, “And her dark chalice Hate prepares. “Lurking beneath a fair disguise, “Her zone with daggers planted round, “Ingratitude, with changing eyes, “Strives Sensibility to wound. “Ye Sister Nine, again inspire “The joys my better moments knew, “When fairy Hope, and young Desire, “On light wing, round my temples flew. “Yet here, on Tideswell's wintry moor, “While drifted snows my steps ensnare, “And through the night the tempests roar, “And fiercely whirl my frozen hair; “As, straggling, towards my home I wend, “Sweet fancy cheers the dreary way, “On my chill'd heart her fires descend, “Bright as the star that leads the day; “And, basking in her cordial beams, “The foster'd Julia's form appears; “The Goddess deck'd her tuneful themes, “Soft warbling through revolving years. “Me Julia's friendship cheers each morn; “Truth whispers it shall ever last; “Then let me present evils scorn, “And bravely triumph o'er the past!” Thou gentle Bard, on whose internal sight Genius has pour'd her many-coloured light; With whom the loveliest of the Virtues dwell, Waving their halcyon plumes around thy cell, Though fortune, blind to merit, fail to throw One gaudy trophy on thy pensive brow, Conscious of worth, thy high, and free-born soul Disdains to court her insolent controul. Though yet proud fame no sunny glance has shed On the low roof, that screens thy modest head, The same exalted spirit scorns to wail Her echoes silent in thy lonely vale. Yet, while one votary of the Muses blames The unjust neglect of those capricious dames, O! may she stimulate that noble pride, Which rather seeks in humblest roof to hide Talents, which Nature's bounty lavish gave, Than, courting Fortune's smile, commence her slave; Than climb Parnassus' steep and dangerous ways, Than drop the rose of Peace to grasp the bays. Thy quiet steps my fancy loves to trace Through walks of savage, or of gentle grace; And, pleas'd, she finds the scenes, that gave thee birth, Types of thy lot, thy talents, and thy worth. As conscious Memory, with reverted glance, Roves the long-known Near the author's native village, Eyam, in Derbyshire. and mountainous expanse, At once her pencil's faithful traits restore The windy tracts of Tideswell's naked moor; Stretch'd on vast hills, that in wide range prevail, Bleak, stony, bare, monotonous, and pale. Far on the waste, in noon-tide's sultry rays, The frequent lime-kiln flings the umber'd blaze. Its suffocating smoke incessant breathes, Shrouding the sun in black convolving wreaths; And oft, with sullied ashes heapt around, Sinks the dark mine, and blots the pallid ground. In vain warm Spring demands her mantle green, No sheltering hedges vivify the scene; O'er its grey breast no undulating trees Wave their bright foliage to the lively breeze, But from the moor the rude, stone walls disjoin, With angle sharp, and long unvarying line, Each cheerless field, where, slowly wandering, feed The lonely cow, and melancholy steed; Expos'd abide the Summer's sultry breath, And wintry storm, that yells along the heath. At length benigner mountains meet our eyes, Whose shrubby heights, in rounder grace, arise; And, from their first steep summit, pleas'd we throw Our eager glances on the depths below, As sinks abrupt the sylvan Monsaldale From the fierce sun-beam, and the howling gale. Behold, in front, the lucid river spread The bankless waters o'er the sunny mead; As of his broad, and sheety shallows proud, Shine, the clear mirrour of the passing cloud; Then, to the left, along the valley glide, With soft meander, and in narrower tide, Through banks, where thick the spreading alders grow, And glassy waves reflect each pendent bough. Refreshing sweets the breathing hay-cocks yield, Richly that tuft the long and narrow field, As graceful, to the right, it curves away Round the green cliffs, with scatter'd ash-trees gay. The red and varied leaf of the mountain-ash justifies the epithet gay. Cliffs, whose smooth breast, above the shadow'd stream, Swells to the sun, and yellows in his beam; While on the opposing shore dwarf foliage hides, Sombrous and soft, the mountain's lofty sides, Throwing its latest fringe upon the flood That laves the concave of the shrubby wood, Till down low rocks, disparted, moss'd, and steep, In broken streams the frothing waters leap, Then through the mazes of the rambling dale Silent they lapse, or rush with tuneful wail. The self-taught Edwin, in his lowly state, Feels this sweet glen an emblem of his fate; For as it stands, in beauty rich and rare, By wild hills neighbour'd, healthy, bleak, and bare, So, midst unletter'd hinds, as rude as those, He, pensive Minstrel of the mountains, rose; Who, like devoted Chatterton, was born In Nature's triumph and in Fortune's scorn, With kindred talents, but with happier mind, By prudence guarded, as by taste refined; Whom Industry preserves from woes severe, Which ill the noble spirit knows to bear; Saves from those pains that Wealth's mean sons deride, Dependent hopes, and heart-corroding pride, When, for wish'd amity, and ow'd respect, It meets the chilling scorn of base neglect; The stingy patron's contumelious aid, The taunt of Envy, studious to upbraid, All, all the ills, by which the proud are known To crush the talents, that eclipse their own. Be thine the mercies, Edwin, which reward E'en manual labour to the enlighten'd Bard, Energic health; and, in rare union join'd, The melting heart, and philosophic mind! Genius is thine;—before his solar state, O! fly ye mists of inauspicious fate! His are the floods of cloudless day, that show The charms that Nature, Knowledge, Art bestow. Has he not given thee wealth, which shames the toys Fortune bestows, and vanity enjoys? Toys of the groveling soul, empower'd to seize On the soft splendours of luxurious ease; Whom yet, with scorn, discerning eyes behold Pleas'd with life's tinsel, reckless of its gold; Gold, richer far than paves Golconda's mine, The genuine wealth of intellect divine, That buys, disdaining Fortune's bounded plain, Creative Mind's illimitable reign. And if, in that vast range, my Muse's powers Lure thy pleas'd tarriance in her cypress bowers, Ah! should'st thou feel, that real sweets belong To the pale florets of her pensive song, The thought that they have sooth'd thy toils, shall dwell Warm with the heart-felt joys, that Fame's bright meed excel. TO THE Rev. JOHN GRANVILLE. Clear was the morn, that saw me, pensive, leave, Pellucid Calwick, thy umbrageous scene; Morn, that beheld the sigh repining heave, And eyes unjoyous meet the blue serene. But had those eyes beheld the azure day Mild in thy large and watry mirror shine, A glance more lively then had hail'd its ray, A lighter heart confess'd its power benign. Yet, though no sunny skies illumed the hours, Pass'd, honour'd Granville, in thy spacious dome, Though winds incessant howl'd around thy bowers, Troubled thy lake, and lash'd it into foam; Though, with eternal rains, the silver Dove Rush'd, swell'd and turbid, down thy beauteous vale, Yet did the friends, yet did the life I love Deride the watry skies, the stormy gale. Thy charming Harriet, Mrs Granville. to my heart how dear! Still in that heart her graceful image lives; Still do I seem her gentle voice to hear, Still feel the glow her cheerful kindness gives. Ah! when your mutual praise my strains pursu'd, And his, to whom those strains allegiance own, Dewes, Court Dewes, Esq. of Wellsburn, in War wickshire, since deceased. the refin'd, the learn'd, the wise, the good, On a self-doubting mind it warmly shone. Beneath thy walls, each elegant delight, By knowledge, taste, and sentiment bestow'd, Rose on the spirit, in succession bright, Till each pale day in mental sunshine glow'd. Thro' her dim showers, half shrouding vale, and lawn, I saw, dear Granville, that no fairer shades, For Lansdown, in poetic tints were drawn, No clearer waters, and no greener glades; When, at thy noble ancestor's request, Who led sweet Pope his forest-haunts among, They rose, in soft, Aonian graces drest, To bloom for ever in unrivall'd song. The blended charms thy crystal scene supplies, Had my weak muse an equal power to trace, On Poesy's bright texture soon should rise Its sylvan charms, in undecaying grace. But ah! I may not hope she can display The splendid web the Bard of Windsor wove, Yet, for his Granville, no sincerer lay Breath'd Friendship's ardour thro' the vocal grove. Connubial and parental bliss is thine, O! may they prove as permanent as sweet! And be the voice of gratulation mine Whene'er I hail thee in thy green retreat! Written Sept. 1786, after a fortnight's residence at Calwick, the seat of the Granville family, in Staffordshire. It stands on the verge of a large, clear, and beautiful lake, with islands. A branch of the river Dove passes through it, and a rich valley forms the scenery on the opposite coast, through which the main river winds. It is bounded by near hills, and beyond them are seen some of the larger Peak mountains. A wood rises behind the house. EPISTLE TO NATHANIEL LISTER, Esq. OF LICHFIELD, ON HAVING READ HIS VERSES IN MANUSCRIPT, WRITTEN DECEMBER 1786. That gentleman is since deceased. Meantime his second son has given to the public prints repeated proofs of very fine poetic talents. Encircled by thy filial band, O, Lister, pleas'd I see thee stand, Rich in the blessing that can balm Each mental wound, each sorrow calm, And every irksome care beguile, The sweetness of the duteous smile. Of fortune and of love possest, With all the sunshine of the breast, At ease thy placid spirit woos The favours of a jocund muse, Who scatters, at thy mild desire, Careless graces o'er thy lyre. Not thee, she marks a luckless son, Whose fortune and renown are one, Who, if his twice-important strain The surly bookseller in vain To-day allows its face to show In front of pamphlet-crowded bow, Must pine, alas! in two-fold sorrow, When pride and hunger fast to-morrow. Nor yet she marks thee, high of aim, A throbbing candidate for fame, Who, plac'd within the sheltering bowers Where ease and plenty speed the hours, Far from their rosy confine strays In authorism's dangerous ways, Where Envy's restless ills betide, Her thorns infest, her serpents glide, Those rhyming snakes, whose malice long Pursues the Bard of higher song. And mark the scribbling Serpent's station, Artificer of defamation! Who, sore beneath the general sense Of his vain Muse's impotence, Turns public Critic, to supply His spleen, and gaunt necessity; Breathes purchas'd praise, in servile tone, On lays as meagre as his own, And with rapacious spite abuses Each happier votary of the muses. Behold, from day-light cautious screen'd, His kennel-dirt, with labour glean'd, This self-elected censor fling, This dull, insidious, nameless thing. Every month teems with strictures on poetry, that display the kindred talents and kindred temper of many of our modern reviewers to those critics, who, in the days of Dryden and Pope, denied them genius, learning, every thing which distinguishes the poet from the mere versifier. O, wise art thou those paths to shun, Where much is lost, and little won; For never, with enduring roots The genuine Poet's laurel shoots, Or high its blooming branch shall wave, Till sprung from his unconscious grave. Yet oft, for candid friends, persuade Thy muse to warble in this shade. Its gales have been inured to spring With notes Aonian on their wing. Ah! witness many a sparkling rhyme, By Garrick rung in tuneful chime, Ere yet on Britain's stage he shone, And shar'd the wreath his Shakespear won! And witness Johnson's loftier strains, Proud glory of his native plains: And theirs, the learn'd, and lucky pair, Dr. Green, and Dr. Newton, afterwards Bishops of Lincoln and Lichfield. They passed many of their youthful years in Lichfield, of which Bishop Newton was a native, and in which Bishop Green was usber to the maternal grandfather of the author of these poems, the Rev. John Hunter; whose school was of high reputation, and from whom David Garrick, and Samuel Johnson, received their classic education. At that period Dr. Green, and Dr. Newton, were rivals in their attachment to the late Mrs Seward, the author's mother, and then Miss Hunter, whose beauty was the theme of their muse. Ordain'd to fill the prelate chair; For modest Green, in Lichfield grove, With Newton, tun'd his lute to love, And many a Muse delighted shed Her myrtle on each rival head, Ere yet the mitre's envied round Their brows with graver honours bound. Witness the bright, the jocund powers, That gave to wit the social hours, When, as their festal influence glow'd, Each prompt idea, as it flow'd, Thy fancy tinged with brilliant dyes, Ingenious, and ingenuous Vyse! The late Rev. Arch-deacon Vyse, Canon of Lichfield. Epigrams, and gay ballads, of exquisite spirit, flowed extempore from his lips, but he declined publishing them. Witness the lays that still engage Poetic eyes, on Dodsley's page, Meek Davies, thine, whose feeling mind Was by each Christian grace refin'd, While purest rays of Delian fire Shed living lustre on thy lyre. Mr Shaw, the Historian of Staffordshire, inserted, with the author's consent, this poem in his work, p. 348. Beneath the lines on Dr Davies, he gives a note of reference to p. 290 of his history—but his information there, on the subject of that gentleman's poetic works, is not accurate. Thus—“He was the author of Verses on Camden's Picture, and of those to Bishop Cornwallis, in Dosdley's Miscellany. He was about to publish his poems, but was dissuaded from it.” In the fifth volume of Dodsley's miscellany, will be found, by Dr. Sneyd Davies, Canon of Lichfield, “Vacuna.” “On John Whalley Arranging Pamphlets.” A classic and exquisite little Poem, entitled, “Epithalamium on the Marriage of Mr Dodd and Miss St. Lege.” “Verses on Two Friends, Mr Dodd and Mr Horace Walpole born the same day.” Nothing can be happier than the thoughts in that panygeric, justly characterising two very eminent, and very opposite, yet united spirits. So far from being dissuaded from publishing his poetry, he did publish it, in a now rare, as valuable collection of poems, given to the public about the year 1744, by his friend the before-mentioned Mr Whalley, Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and who was himself, as that volume evinces, an ingenious poet. It was dedicated to Horace Walpole. Its pages from 175 to 264, glow with the emanations of Dr Davies' genius. The verses on seeing Archbishop Williams' Monument in Caernarvonshire, are tender, solemn, impressive, and interesting. So is the poem to C. P. It contains the following lines, which speak for themselves. —At this spot, this point, “Here, Pitt, The late Lord Chatham. we social meet, and gaze around, “And look back to the scenes our pastimes trod “In life's fresh morning, when the gamesome hours “Had sliding feet, and laugh'd themselves away. “Luxurious season! vital prime! where Thames “Flows by Etona's walls, and cheerful sees “Her sons wide swarming;—and where sedgy Cam “Bathes with slow lapse his academic grove; “Pierian walks!—O never, never hope, “Impossible, untenable, to grasp “Those joys again, to feel alike the pulse “Dancing, and fiery spirits b iling high; “Or see the pleasure, that with careless wing “Swept on, and flowery garlands toss'd around, “Disporting. Try to call her back;—as soon “Bid yesterday return, arrest the flight “Of time; or musing on the river's brink “Say to the wave, that huddles swiftly by “For ever;—“from thy fountain roll anew!” Source of my Life, Rev. Thomas Seward, Canon of Lichfield. In conjunction with Mr Simpson, he published in 1751, an approved Edition of Beaumont and Fletcher's Plays, with critical notes of much ingenuity. The excellent preface was intirely his. His Female Right to Literature, published in the 2d volume of the first edition of Dodsley's Miscellany, has been much and justly celebrated. That same volume, p. 302, contains Mr Seward's Verses on Shakespear's monument at Stratford-upon-Avon. They do not yield, either in spirit, or beauty, to any panygeric on that great poet, which has been given by our noblest Bards. In the subsequent editions of that Miscellany, there is an idiot alteration in that poem, made by some man, who thought a completer rhyme a good atonement for grossly injuring the sense— “Nor yet unrival'd the Meonian strain, “The British Eagle, and the Mantuan Swan “Tower equal heights—but happier Stratford thou, &amp;c.” The editor chose to print Swan Swain, at the expense of all consistency in the metaphor. and all the joys That from a cultured mind arise, Thy efforts, liberal as benign, The glories of the Delphic Shrine To my yet infant eyes display'd In these green vales, this blooming shade; Thou, who didst chace the mists of time From sylvan Fletcher's beauteous rhyme, And graver Beaumont's nervous page, The faithful mirrour of his age. Thou, in whose free harmonious song The Female Rights shall flourish long; That song, with generous disdain, Which breaks the sullen pedant's chain, Forg'd our aspiring sex to bind From ranging the high tracts of mind, Where Fancy's flowers, and Learning's fruit, On every side, luxuriant shoot;— Source of my Life, it will not prove A vain essay of filial love, Here, if a right thy daughter claim To rank with theirs thy honour'd name, Whose silver lyre's harmonious sound Made lovely Lichfield classic ground, Though now thy vital lamp's faint light Gleams on the verge of its long night, Pale, dim, and weak its social blaze, And pale its intellectual rays. Mr Seward's life was preserved by the skill and attention of Dr. Jones, of Lichfield, more than three years after the composition of the above poem. Mr Seward resided in the Bishop's palace at Lichfield, the last 32 years of his life, as did his predecessor, Mr Walmsley, the learned, and liheral patron of David Garrick, and Samuel Johnson. While duteous love, with anxious aim, Guards from rude blasts its quivering flame, Through yet a few more quiet years, That bring to thee nor pains, nor fears, O, be it mine to cheer, and warm Thy drooping heart, thy helpless form! And now recorded be the song, That floated sweet these vales among, Or lighten'd with satiric ray, The song of proudly virtuous Day. Thomas Day, Esq. since deceased, Author of the Dying Negro, which has, by misinformation, been given in one of the public prints of the year 1800, to his friend, Mr Bicknel, also deceased. It is a noble composition, and the first poem that called the attention of this nation to the miseries inflicted on that abused race. Mr Day's Sandford and Merton is a very popular work on education. The philosophic Mr Keir, published a Life of that Gentleman, ingeniously wtitten, but with too indiscriminate eulogy. Mr Day's mind was rather great than amiable; his virtues were of a stern complexion. He resided in Lichfield during the years 1771 and 1772, and was living when the above poem was written. Pride, it is still thy sullen part To check each kindling glow of heart; For how should soft affection thrive, How keep its tender blooms alive, Where thy repulsive shadow lours, Like the dark yew on springing flowers! That sheds its chilling damps around, And wintry makes the vernal ground. So changest thou affection's beam, To cold, and colourless esteem. Yet, bounteous Day, that groveling pride Did ne'er thy words and actions guide, Which deals its smiles in each degree, As rank, or wealth, their gifts decree; 'Tis thine to look too coldly down On talents liberal as thine own, While sickness, want, and sorrow, share Thine ample boon, thy watchful care. See favour'd Lichfield's classic train Adorn'd by Elliot's happy strain! F. P. Elliot, Esq. then of Shenston-Moss, near Lichfield. And his, for whom the Sisters nine, And Sisters three, in strife combine, Which should their choicest gifts award, That form the Courtier, and the Bard. Ah! need I say 'tis Boothby claims Brooke Boothby, Esq since Sir Brooke Boothby, and then of Lichfield. These honours from the goddess-dames? With vigorous mind, whose efforts bend Where Science' widening bounds extend, That ductile, to his earnest gaze Expand before its potent rays; And whose so seldom erring art Averts, or blunts the mortal dart, Relaxing from severer toil Here Darwin won Dr Darwin, Author of the Botanic Garden, Zoonomia, &amp;c. He was an inhabitant of Lichfield, from the year 1757 to 1781. the Muses smile; Fram'd in these bowers the splendid rhyme, Of brightest glow, and richest chime, Still nervous, though it still retain The Leonine, and Runic chain; And ne'er, Oh Bard! their power disclaim, For thou canst gem each link they frame. These silver lyres are heard no more On Stow's calm lake, and grassy shore; Yet Grove, William Grove, Esq. then living, but since, alas! deceased. The richness of his poetic vein may be observed in his Sonnet to the Author of these Volumes. It is amongst the complimentary poems addressed to her, and prefixed to her miscellany. as through their mead he roves, With classic notes, that Clio loves, Though seldom, yet at times pervades The silence of these verdant shades And, Lister, may they echo long The tones of thy convivial song! EPISTLE TO GEORGE ROMNEY, Esq. ON HIS HAVING PRESENTED THE AUTHER'S PICTURE TO HER FATHER, MAY 1788. Thou, who hast given so many golden hours, That Genius consecrates by all her powers, Given them, the heart of failing age to warm, By the wish'd semblance of a daughter's form, Accept the sole reward thy efforts sought, The acknowledg'd joy this generous present brought. Creative efforts!—that with living hues Fix the illusive likeness, and diffuse O'er all the breathing form, and glowing face, With art's last happiness, the nameless grace, Born of thy pencil, for the actual boon, Knew nor my youth's fresh morn, or ripen'd noon. Long since, in a lov'd Father's feeble breast, Life's train of anxious wishes sunk to rest; Yet one remain'd, one fond wish linger'd still, For the pledged gift of thy consummate skill. “O, my Belov'd!” how often would he say, “Fast as my worn existence fleets away, “Life's prov'd uncertainty to sprightly health, “May rob my soul of all its earthly wealth; “Childless I yet to my late grave may go, “Where only tears for thee would cease to flow: “'Twere comfort still to think, should Heaven ordain “My hopeless years to prove so sharp a pain, “Something might yet to these dim eyes apear, “That should that look, that smile of kindness wear, “With which thou com'st to bless each lingering day, “Of feeble age, in its perceiv'd decay.” The shades of yesternight were softly drawn Wide o'er these blooming fields, and circling lawn, And the dear Full of Days his pillow prest In the soft slumber of an infant's rest; Two wond'rous Youths, Mr Henry Cary, and Mr Thomas Lister, who each, at the age of fifteen, published verses of much beauty and classic elegance. who strike the Muses lyre, Ere manhood's dawn, with all a poet's fire, Sat by thy friend, to speed the evening hours By culling florets from Aonian bowers; When gladly, through the swift-unfolding door, The promis'd gift a smiling servant bore. With curious eyes the youthful Lyrists hail, The heav'd dismission of each tardy nail, Till to their sight the speaking canvass shone, And made the magic of thy pencil known. At early day to the lov'd couch I creep, Chasing with lenient voice a Father's sleep, Then near its pillow draw his hearts desire, Mark his wan cheek faint tinged with pleasure's fire, Enjoy his warm apostrophe to thee, And his now seldom tear of extacy. O! generous Romney! whose expansive heart Glows the blest rival of thy perfect art, Thy genius is a Sun, that now serene Shines on the surface of a wintry scene; Pale waning Life smiles in its glad'ning rays, And to their light a Bramin's homage pays. IDYLLIUM. FROM THE ITALIAN. Beauteous infant, dearest boy, Whither did thy sister hie? Her favourite hill, and brook, and glade See not, to day, the charming maid. Has she led her new-shorn flock Through the vale, or towards the rock? Went she forth at early morn? Will she, ere the noon, return? Tell me;—ah! if tell thou wilt, Purple-streak'd and orange-gilt, This apple,—larger, look, and finer Than yesterday I gave at dinner, This I'll give;—aye this, and more, There's a little bird in store, A lovely bird, and green his wing, Round his neck a silken string.— Silent yet!—O, thankless elf! Thankless, even as herself. Stubborn chit!—no more to thee, Listening, leaning on my knee, Will I tell delightful tales Of dancing fays in moonlight vales, Mingling all I sing, or say, With kisses kind, and frolic play. What!—hush!—call thy mother!—fye! Faithless hope!—perfidious boy! The mother's here, with passion wild, This it is to trust a child! Here take the apple,—get along Little fool,—and hold thy tongue! TO Mrs SMITH, DAUGHTER OF MR SAVILLE, ON HER SINGING IN PUBLIC,—JANUARY 1789. In human form should powers divine appear, And seraph choirings touch the mortal ear, Some harsh and darken'd bosoms would be found Cold and fastidious to the charming sound; Too loud,—too soft,—too spirited,—too tame, Form their vain jargon of unmeaning blame. That something wrong they know not to express, Which sense can ne'er explain, nor science guess. Too proud to praise, and much too fine to feel, Their censure strange should souls like these reveal, O fear them not—they are not worth thy fear, Yet whence, too modest! whence that starting tear? Friendship, thou sayst, is partial; yet rely On pleasure's tear, swift springing to the eye; Trust thou the sweetness of thy melting song, When loud encores thy silver tones prolong. Trust them, at least from stranger-lips, who ne'er Knew thy mild virtues, or thy fate severe. Instructed still on thy melodious course By him at once thy voice, and virtue's source, Who guides thee every coarser sound to shun, Swell the soft note, the brilliant descant run; And gives the soul of poetry to dwell In thy sweet tones, that sweetest flutes excell, Be thou assured Eliza, thou wilt find Thy power establish'd o'er each feeling mind; Then safely resting on thy filial claim, Win the bright honours of harmonic fame. And would'st thou a resembling music hear And learn how meet thy notes the general ear, Come to the wild wood, and the glen with me, When leafy June has curtain'd every tree; There, in the still noon of the lunar night, Shall sounds congenial thrill thee with delight, When, hid beneath long grass, a liquid tune The bubbling runnel warbles to the moon. ALPINE SCENERY. A POEM. ADDRESSED TO THE REV. THOMAS SEDGWICK WHALLEY, DURING HIS RESIDENCE ON THE CONTINENT, IN 1785. Glad, as the lone night-wanderer, on his way Hails the mild day-spring, red'ning on the shore, We meet description's light diffusing ray, Shining on climes not given us to explore. Powers, that thro' distant scenes, or soft, or dread, Lead the charm'd spirit with supreme controul, Where icy hills, or torrid plains, are spread, Where winds might waft us, or where seas might roll. Rich in those powers, energic, warm, and bland, The leaves where Wraxal, More, and Coxe explain How clime prevails,—thrones rise,—or laws expand, To ravage, or to bless each mark'd domain. And gayer Sterne, whose page, to latest time, Britons shall love;—since its pervading art, As manners vary with the varied clime, Winds through the labyrinths of the human heart. Does one mild virtue spread its lunar ray, Deep in the pensive bosom's coy recess, Untrac'd by him along its latent way To love,—to pity,—charity,—and peace? Or lurks one selfish passion, sly, and grave, But at his touch its genuine form shall wear? To whose free pen presiding Genius gave The force resistless of Ithuriel's spear. And shalt not thou, O daring Cook! obtain The lasting homage of the enquiring soul, Who, 'mid the dangers of the frozen main, Lifts the pale curtains of the southern pole! But now what meed shall my thrill'd fancy pay The talents, which to public honours cold, Yet warm to amity, those scenes display That did to their delighted sense unfold, When up the Savoy mountains This poem is intended as a poetical mirror to the striking pictures of Alpine scenery, which Mr Whalley's letters from the Continent presented to the author. Whalley rose, Where Alpine eagles have their aeries built; Saw rocks as bold as savage Rosa shows, And dales as soft as sunny Claude has gilt; His lov'd Chatilion's home; Baron de Chatilion, a young Savoyard nobleman, whom Mr Whalley met at Dijon, and on whose account he and Mrs Whalley passed the winter at Chambery, the capitol of Savoy, situated amidst some of the highest Alps. It is the winter residence of the Chatilion family. whose youthful mind Congenial wit, and kindred worth adorn; By genius nerv'd, by classic taste refined, A summer ripeness in a vernal morn. What marvel, Whalley, that an heart like thine Should brave the surging storms, that ceaseless howl When winter yells around that craggy shrine With icy breath and petrifying scowl; What marvel?—drawn by the magnetic power, That soul to soul so instantly endears, Investing friendship's young, and blossoming hour With all the fruits that crown her mellowest years. I bless that power, illum'd by fancy's ray, It gives to thy free pen supreme command, That bears me with resistless force away, And on the rocks of Savoy bids me stand; Shows me the Alps, huge in embattled pride, A clust'ring Phalanx, meet the wintry gales; Or where, dispers'd, they seem, with giant stride, To chace each other to the gloomy vales; Now, in vast curtains of encircling clouds, Wrap their stupendous heads from mortal eyes; And then, awakening, pierce the misty shrouds, Roll the dark volumes back—and brave the skies. I see, as winter blots the lurid air, The savage Graces o'er the mountains stalk, Shake the frore horrors from their shaggy hair, While howling wolves attend their desert walk; Then, as with livid hand, and Gorgon frown, Sternly they wave the pale, petrific wand O'er the loud floods, down, down the vast steeps thrown;— In silent ice the shrinking cataracts stand. Now charm'd I mark the genial breath of spring To life, and beauty wake the dreary scene, When o'er the melting vales she hastes to fling Her silver blossoms, and her tender green; And on the lawns, between the mountains spread, To bid the floret's lavish perfume flow, Against their basis rest its blushing head, Whose summits whiten in eternal snow. I mark the clouds, that gorgeous summer shows, Enfold the mountain-cliffs with mantles bright, Or gather on their vast, imperial brows In glorious diadems of colour'd light; Or sail from rock to rock, and change their form, As setting suns their last effulgence shed, That, now with gold, and now with crimson warm, Tinges their floating skirts, magnificently spread. Charm'd I behold purpureal autumn lead Her grapes of deep, or of transparent stain, Round the tall steeps, and o'er the yellow mead, Varied, and spotted with the sable grain. The black grain, which, sowed in patches amidst the corn-fields of Savoy, produces a landscape singularly shaded, and new to an English eye. View that cold mass, shining as though it drew New radiant whiteness from the orb that fills With cordial strength, and gives the tyrian hue To the rich vines that deck the opposing hills; Hear melted cataracts thunder down the steeps, Startling the gloomy valley's deep repose, Whose current, as from rock to rock it leaps, Retains the whiteness of its parent snows, Ample and still, that on the mountain's brow, Heedless of tepid, or of stormy gales, Sit,—in calm contrast to the roar below Of filial torrents, tumbling to the vales. They, through the wide-stretch'd forest, black with pines, Run silvering onward with divided streams, While, in the vale, the lone Montmelion shines, The fortress on the rock, Montmelion, was the last that yielded to Lewis the Fourteenth, when he conquered Savoy. This rock stands single in the centre of the vale, wholly unconnected with the surrounding Alps. Gilded by sunny evening's saffron gleams. Once, on that insulated summit, rose The towers most hostile to ambition's sway, That ere for Savoy's weal had dar'd oppose The Gallic victor, on his ruthless way. Resisting long, they found resistance vain, And to the polish'd despot slowly yield;— Why did not wanton Montespan detain Voluptuous Louis from the deathful field? Tender repentant Valiere!—not thy tears For honour lost so deeply pitied flow, As those sad sighs, and agonizing fears That rose, in all the bitterness of woe, When the pale Genius of that lovely land Lean'd from his rock, defil'd with goary stains, And saw fierce War stretch forth his red right hand, Drenching with blood those fair, and fertile plains. Wall'd by the cloud-capt Alps on every side, The plenteous vales of Savoy guarded seem From the fierce inroad of Ambition's tide, When neighbouring powers unsluice its wasteful stream. But ah! what barriers may kind Nature rear Which that fell Demon, on his restless course, Shall not, in some disastrous hour, o'er-peer, Sap by his art, or vanquish by his force? O happier Switzerland!—as yet 'tis thine To see bright Liberty triumphant shake Her radiant Ægis on thy craggy shrine, And dip her pinions in thy silver lake! So it was then with that country—alas, the change! Not on its fertile banks, or through the street Of busy Zuric, does the squalid crew Of useless beggary the traveller meet, Wound his reluctant ear, and shock his view; But Plenty breathes an universal gale, And liberal Commerce every want supplies, For equal her unfetter'd powers prevail, Urge the quick step, and animate the eyes. Where idleness, or vicious waste alone Want Life's warm comforts, or her soft repose; O Monarchy! can thy proud pomp atone For those lost joys Equality bestows? Ye, who so loudly plead for kingly sway, The author has since been convinced by the fatal Revolution in France, that a limited monarchy, with its subordinate ranks, is the best form of government for a great nation like that country, or Britain. The rank of nobles, and the pageant train Of mean subordination, speed your way Where Savoy's richest vallies teem in vain. Not for her hapless sons her vineyards bend, With loaded branches, from the mountain's side; O! not for them her golden vales extend, Or slope her forests in theatric pride. In beauty's pomp, in vegetation's wealth Boon Nature cloth'd her vallies and her bowers; But seek her capital,—view life, and health, Shudder, and pine beneath her crumbling towers! O! if that form of government is best That makes its people happiest,—then compare The crowds Chambery's ruin'd streets infest With those that breathe throng'd Zuric's gladden'd air! And when that calm comparison is made By English spirits, shall they fail to guard Those sacred laws, Ambition would invade, And save us from a Despot's proud award? But now, from blessings England never knew, From evils which, I trust, she ne'er shall prove, Turn thou, my soul, thy unavailing view, And seek the scenes thy kindling senses love! Though, hapless Savoy, Liberty is fled From thy wild haunts, that every charm disclose, Yet, with my friend, thy mazes let me tread, And in thy graces half forget thy woes. Calm let us sit, at Evening's solemn hour, Beneath a rock;—and see her mantle brown Veil the mark'd features of each Alpine tower, Till in one huge stupendous mass they frown; View Night's pale orb her shadowy pomp assume, And o'er the sombrous cliffs majestic ride; And partially their craggy points illume Or deck with hoary light their stony side; Silver the vale, which at their feet secure Slumbers,—and smiles amid its peaceful dreams; Bares its green bosom to the radiance pure, That gems the Iser's wildly-devious streams. And during brighter hours, in smiling gaze, Shall our fix'd eyes the Bourgian Lake A beautiful lake in the province of Bourgia. The ancient castle of the Chatilion family stands upon it, but in too ruinous a state to be their general habitation. Mr Whalley, on his tour through that province with the Baron, passed a very tempestuous night in that shattered castle. behold, When Autumn-evenings, and their burnish'd rays, Tint her green waters with etherial gold; That lake, spread wide between stupendous hills, Whose sylvan curtains slope and kiss her tide; While through them gleam the tributary rills, That rush, with frothing haste, to swell her pride. I view thy friend's paternal walls ascend From her broad bosom to an height sublime; While o'er her waves the shatter'd turrets bend, And frown defiance vain to whelming time. Yet there, amid the ravage of his powers, The desolate Graces hold their pensive reign, Silent they stand beneath the cloven towers, Which, what they lose in strength, in interest gain. Thou, Whalley, in the mansion large and drear, Whose mouldering walls dismantled seem to scowl, At midnight laid, wert not displeas'd to hear The rising tempest o'er the waters howl. Against the rattling windows as it beat, And mutter'd thro' the chasms, no weak alarm Shock'd thy aw'd sense—tho' oft the ponderous gate Fiercely it shook, as with a giant's arm. Nor would my friend that solemn scene have changed For all the hand of luxury knows to spread; Not then his rapt imagination ranged To the gilt roof, bright hearth, and downy bed. Or if a wish in softer scenes to rove Stole through his breast, amid that awful gloom, 'Twas for the murmurs of a cypress grove, 'Twas for the silence of a sister's tomb. Mr Whalley lost his beloved sister, the lovely and excellent Mrs Sage, two years before he left England. Thus, when the oak groan'd sullen in the wind, And distant far the drizzling dawn of day, Alone, and musing, at its roots reclin'd, On cold Temora's hill great Ossian lay; And heard his harp, high on the riv'd boughs hung, By pale dim hands disturb'd, low-jarring shake; While shadowy shields amid the tempest rung, Clash'd by the spirits of the troubled lake. Nor griev'd, but that the loud, and angry storms The voice of the heroic Dead might drown; The noble mind reveres terrific forms, And grows enamour'd of their darkest frown. Now from those scenes, where awful horror sheds Gloom, that contrasts sweet beauty's ruddy light, My gentle friend his lov'd Eliza leads Where throng'd Avignon's lofty domes invite. Yet there no ardour of his soul decays, Fann'd, lone Valclusa, The celebrated valley near Avignon. The laurels which Petrarch had so lavishly planted there, in allusion to the name of his mistress, are no longer to be found. Olives are now the only trees in the stony, rocky, and barren precincts near the Fountain. by thy amorous gales; He, as with Sorga's winding wave he strays, The rocks—the streams—the hallow'd Fountain hails! And where those rocks, with shadowy summits, lean O'er the clear waters, in their solemn rest, And not a wave, upon the deep serene, Disturbs the darken'd fountain's glassy breast, With Heaven-directed eyes I see him bend; I see the shade of Petrarch hovering nigh, Pleas'd with his glory's richest gale to blend The rising incense of a generous sigh.— Now, when the neighbouring mountain's rigid snows, Spring's milder rays for aye inured to mock, Sink, as the Summer's sun more fiercely glows, Deep to the fluid sources in the rock, 'Tis then the Naiad from their sullen sleep Wakes her deep waters;—and in murmuring tones High o'er the cavern'd basin bids them leap Adown the shelving mound of rocky stones; In flashing eddies swell thy lucid train, Clear Sorga, wandering through the olive bowers, Till, in an ampler mirror, proud Sommane The Chateau de Sommane. It stands on the right-hand side of the valley, and was once the habitation of Laura. It still belongs to her direct descendants, and was lately inhabited by the learned and ingenious Abbe de Sade, who, some years since, published the voluminous history of Petrarch and Laura, the Abbé's ancestress. From this work Mrs Dobson formed her valuable abridgement. Eyes the dark shadows of her lonely towers It suits ye well, that air of stately gloom, O towers, where high-born Laura sojourn'd long! The Nymph by beauty deck'd with peerless bloom, The Nymph immortaliz'd in peerless song. Thee, Whalley, breathing, as thou rangest there, Petrarch's sweet lays, how often I behold! The lays that paint Valclusa's charming fair, Bright as its laurels, as its fountain cold. Shade of the Bard, who form'd that deathless lay, And gave thy vale to fame, a dearer guest Shall ne'er among its lone meanders stray, Ne'er shalt thou hail a more congenial breast! Yet still, sublimer Savoy, still thy haunts On Whalley's mind in deeper trace shall dwell; Not that alone thy loftier grace enchants The spirit, touch'd by Fancy's potent spell; Those awful heights the stamp and image bear Of dearest amity;—her living smile Each recollected mountain long shall wear, Each vale romantic and each rocky pile. Where Matron excellence The Baroness de Chatilion. in friendship warm, Source, and Protectress of each dear delight, Breath'd through the social walls the sacred charm That gives to Virtue the convivial night. There, with Chatilion's duteous cares to vie, Two other noble sons assiduous strove, And watch'd each glance of her maternal eye, In deep respect, and with preventive love. While their sweet sister, whom the loves adorn, With hope's soft blush, and facile smile serene, Bright as the star that leads the vernal morn, Sat sparkling by, and more illum'd the scene. A mother's mild restrictions only known, There, 'twas thy lot, fair maid, to meet the rays, That still on thee with cordial lustre shone, In each fraternal glance, and social gaze; Those suns of the cheer'd heart, that never shine Within monastic walls;—in gloom precise, From day to day, where Gallic virgins pine, Or buy dismission at a fatal price. The young women of France and Savoy are educated in monasteries, nor, in general, mix at all with the world till they are removed from their gloomy and wearisome exclusion, to be married to the husband appointed for them. With-held the joys, that other joys excell, And from progressive passion only flow, Whose tender constancy may best repel The gay contagion of the faithless vow, Breath'd from the frolic dames, by vice ensnared, Vice, whose attractions seize the unguarded heart When conjugal indifference has prepared The youthful bosom for their venom'd dart. Ye Gallic parents, to the nuptial shrine When you, to glut your avarice, or your pride, From the unsocial convent's shade malign Lead to the altar the unsoften'd bride, To Nature, and to Duty lost ye prove, Ye, who from Youth's soft bosom have with-held That previous, gradual, voluntary love, Of nuptial faith the adamantine shield. Hard on your hoary heads the future crimes Of this your filial sacrifice shall bear, When the seductions of licentious times Her young, and undefended heart ensnare. Yet O! how general this parental guilt, In France!—in Savoy!—miserable proof Of tyranny, on proud example built, From thrones descending to the private roof! A rare exemption from the common doom, Maid of Chatilion's race, thou late didst prove, When joys domestic gilt thy years of bloom, Far from the lonely cloister's frowning grove. But O! if bliss illume our earthly course, How soon, al s! its cheering lustres fly! That matron-worth, of all those joys the source, The silver cord, that link'd each social tie, Smote by the ruthless hand of dire disease Gasps on her fever'd couch!—my gentle friends, What pain was yours to see the tyrant seize The form, that duteous love in vain defends! O! grieved reverse of those enlivening hours, That stay'd you on your purpos'd way so long! Now, for the soul's, and senses' darling powers, Wit, science, music, and its melting song,— The stealing step!—the hush'd and darken'd room!— The anxious whisper!—the extended cross! The manly grief, that firmly meets its doom, Yet inly ruminates, and mourns its loss! The wailful accent,—the o'erwhelmed eye Of helpless beauty!—trembling, chill'd, and faint, With arms extended, and convulsive sigh, Sunk on the pillow of the dying saint.— And thou, my friend, a stranger though so late, In this sad scene art not refus'd thy part; Not shut to thee is sorrow's silent gate, Not cold to thee its agonizing heart. Nor can thy hesitating step forbear, Thy trembling hands the curtains slowly ope; Thy faltering words the tender fraud prepare, And half articulate the faithless hope. Dim eyes that feebly rise to thine, the while, In gaze incredulous;—the pale, cold hand Wav'd gently; with a faint, and pensive smile On the wan lip, that tender fraud withstand; And in expression, far beyond the reach Of vocal breath, while life is ebbing fast, Solemn the task of resignation teach, And say to griev'd affection—All is Past! Yet, as with energy angelic fir'd, The glowing interest in her pious breast, By thine, and thy Eliza's worth inspir'd, O'er Nature's final struggles rise confest; For, as thou kneelest by the bed of death, Thy fingers clasping o'er thy moisten'd eyes, And hear'st, with ear appall'd, the short'ning breath, Warming her icy hand with ceaseless sighs; E'en in that awful, that momentous hour, When the dark grave's terrific portals ope, On thee the expiring lips their blessings pour, Mix'd with the accents of immortal hope! O! may those fervent blessings, on my friends Breath'd by departing goodness, be fulfill'd! Then, as new joys each varying clime extends, Shall health and peace their wandering footsteps gild. Till back, at length, to Albion's silver shores, To open arms, and longing hearts they fly;— Glad may they hail the period, that restores Her soft green vallies, and her wayward sky! If glow her suns less permanently bright, If breathe her gales less exquisitely bland; If her hills rise a less stupendous height, Her glassy lakes in less expansion stand; Yet o'er her lov'd, capricious region broods Dear Safety, still on Halcyon pinions found; No bursting mountain pours the fiery floods, No dire convulsion rends the quiet ground; No gloomy tyrant glares upon her throne, Breaking with crimson hands the legal rod, Nor raves Intolerance, with bigot frown, Usurping still the attributes of God; But liberal Freedom, in the gracious form Of Albion's tutelary Genius, there Breathes, with unchanging sway, her influence warm, Though suns, and winds, and skies, and tempers veer. With every soft affection in her train, My friends, their purpos'd years of absence o'er, Shall she not summon to her verdant plain? Shall she not welcome to her silvery shore? Since, though for her their hands, in state sublime, Nor bear the olive, nor the laurel bough; Their perfect worth, in many a foreign clime, Reflects mild lustre on her sacred brow. For this, when glad they furl the slacken'd sail, Her quicken'd step shall print the yielding sands; Their wish'd return delighted will she hail, Whose virtues honour'd her in distant lands. ODE ON GENERAL ELIOTT's RETURN FROM GIBRALTAR, IN 1787. I. With grateful welcome, with triumphant praise, Thy honour'd Chief, O rescued Britain, meet! Whose dauntless prowess, in resplendent rays, Shone on the darkness of thy long defeat; Gave thee, on thy silvery shores, While Peace the civic crown restores, Beneath her train of joys again to shine, As loss had ne'er chastis'd, oppression ne'er been thine. II. Think, Britannia, think how late, Around thy pale unshelter'd head, To blast thy gloomy pride, avenging fate Unequal war's disastrous terrors spread; While thy torn trophies, drench'd in blood, She scatter'd o'er the western flood, That the provincial standard high she rais'd, By Gallia's lilies deck'd, by Spain's proud crest emblaz'd. I. That thy vain foes, elated to behold The long Invincible at last subdued; Their tide of conquest to that fortress roll'd, By sullen Spain with dread and envy view'd. See! in united strength and pride, At Calpe's base their navies ride, Hurl up its steeps the thunders of their power, That burst the social roof, and rend the warrior tower! II. Crest-fall'n Britain, where were then The rumours of thy matchless might? And where had been the empress of the main, Had skill and valour risen a common height? No common height those bulwarks rose, When Eliott lighten'd on thy foes, Wing'd his red bolts, that wrapp'd their fleets in flame, Resistless as his sword, and glowing as his fame! I. Mark the invading host, elate no more! Recoiling pause between a choice so dire! Alike they hear the British lion roar In the o'erwhelming flood, and raging fire! Groaning they plunge!—in wild despair, With raiment scorch'd, and blazing hair! The billows, closing o'er their struggling frames, Are purpled by the gore, illumin'd by the flames! II. Warm in virtue's native glow, Heroic Eliott's great ally, His valiant Curtis, bending o'er the prow, With all the twice-bless'd angel Shakespeare beautifully says of Mercy: “?it is twice-bless'd, “It blesses him that gives, and him that takes.” in his eye, Commands to push his conquering oars, Where most the fiery torrent pours; The victims from their instant fate to save, And snatch them back to life, from the devouring wave. I. O Britain!—O my country! then 'twas thine T' emerge from ev'ry cloud that veil'd thy light! In all the plendour of that worth to shine, Which erst, with ray peculiar, deck'd thy might; What time, amidst thy vanquish'd foes, Thy name with added lustre rose, For that thy precepts to thy sons impart, With the undaunted soul, the generous melting heart. II. High thy martial influence soar'd, On Belgian plains when Gallic gore, In Freedom's cause, intrepid Marlborough pour'd; And white for England, the eventful hour, Beneath the royal William's sword, 1.9.Royal William's sword—Duke of Cumberland. When gaunt rebellion grimly cower'd, When, of her scorpion stings disarm'd, she fled, In Scotia's desert caves to hide her recreant head. I. Nor sacred less the youthful warrior's fame, Dear-bought Quebec! upon thy plains beheld, Who fall'n and bleeding—at the loud acclaim That hail'd Britannia mistress of the field; That bade her crimson standard rise Victorious in the echoing skies, Lifts the pale eye, a gleam of transport fires, And, smiling on his wounds, triumphantly expires! II. Palms unfading round their urn Let their favour'd country strew! Since to the lavish wreaths she long had worn, They brought new laurels of enduring glow; To Eliott, more indebted, raise In higher tone, the notes of praise, Who hid, in glory's blaze, her livid stain, Impress'd by rash attempts, irresolute and vain. I. So when the wintry tempest's baleful powers Have risen a vernal day-spring to deform, If the all-cheering sun, at evening hours, Throws back the sable curtains of the storm, Green hills, and gilded mountains gay, In dewy brightness meet his ray; Creation kindles, as its lustre flows, Till, in a soften'd night, he leaves her to repose. II. Fruitful as the ensuing morn, When smiling May with zephyr sports, The graceful arts Britannia's dome adorn, And floats her Commerce to the distant ports. To thee, brave Eliott! well she knows Their mild prosperity she owes; Since awful honour must his beams unveil, Ere full the arts can bloom, or Commerce widely sail. I. A meaner mind, such signal conquest gain'd, Had rush'd to meet its country's pæans warm; But Eliott, calm, through circling years, remain'd Beneath the Rock, defended by his arm; Her shatter'd ramparts to restore, And firm through ages bid them tower; That from her brow the British flag may stream, To proud Iberia's gales in majesty supreme. II. Not the trophies, not the strains Of transport, on his Albion's shore, When Eliott's deeds rung thro' her vaulted fanes, The acknowledg'd bulwarks of her falling power, Could lure, with all that joy prepares, The hero from his guardian cares; No praise, no meed, no trophy he desir'd, Save that which conscious worth, in all its glow, inspired. I. His toils accomplish'd, to his native clime, In unassuming greatness, lo! he comes!— And can it be, that the elapse of time The sacred sense of gratitude consumes? No, Britain, no!—thy raptur'd gaze, Thy fairest meed, thy warmest lays, Shall chase the doubt, and shame the injurious fear, In thy resounding ports when Eliott's sails appear II. May the blessings that await Honour on the lap of Peace, Illustrious soldier! mark thy future fate, Bloom like thy virtues, with thy years increase! Long may'st thou, benignly, see Britannia, generous, brave, and free, Wide o'er the world, as in her laurel'd prime, Dart the commanding glance, and lift the brow sublime! END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. EYAM. This poem was written August 1788, on a journey through Derbyshire, to a music-meeting at Sheffield. The author's father was then Rector of Eyam, an extensive village, that runs along a mountainous terrace, in one of the highest parts of the Peak. She was born there, and there past the first seven years of her life, and often, in future periods of her youth and riper years, visited the place with her father, on several weeks residence. The middle part of the village is built on the edge of a deep dell, which has very picturesque and beautiful features. For one short week I leave, with anxious heart, Source of my filial cares, the Full of Days, Lur'd by the promise of Harmonic Art To breathe her Handel's soul-exalting lays. Pensive I trace the Derwent's amber wave, From the peculiar nature of the clay on the mountains from which it descends, the river Derwent has a yellow tint, that well becomes the dark foliage on its banks, and the foam produced by a rocky channel. Foaming through umbrag'd banks, or view it lave The soft, romantic vallies, high o'er-peer'd By hills and rocks, in savage grandeur rear'd. Not two short miles from thee, can I refrain Thy haunts, my native Eyam, long unseen?— Thou and thy lov'd inhabitants, again Shall meet my transient gaze.—Thy rocky screen, Thy airy cliffs I mount; and seek thy shade, Thy roofs, that brow the steep, romantic glade; But, while on me the eyes of Friendship glow, Swell my pain'd sighs, my tears spontaneous flow. In scenes paternal, not beheld through years, Nor view'd, till now, but by a Father's side, Well might the tender, tributary tears, From keen regrets of duteous fondness glide! Its pastor, to this human-flock no more Shall the long flight of future days restore! Distant he droops,—and that once gladdening eye Now languid gleams, e'en when his friends are nigh. Through this known walk, where weedy gravel lies, Rough, and unsightly;—by the long, coarse grass Of the once smooth, and vivid green, with sighs To the deserted Rectory I pass;— Stray through the darken'd chambers' naked bound, Where childhood's earliest, liveliest bliss I found; How chang'd, since erst, the lightsome walls beneath, The social joys did their warm comforts breathe! Ere yet I go, who may return no more, That sacred pile, 'mid yonder shadowy trees, Let me revisit!—Ancient, massy door, Thou gratest hoarse!—my vital spirits freeze, Passing the vacant pulpit, to the space Where humble rails the decent altar grace, And where my infant sister's ashes sleep, Whose loss I left the childish sport to weep. Now the low beams, The ancient custom of hanging a garland of white roses, made of writing paper, and a pair of white gloves, over the pew of the unmarried villagers, who die in the flower of their age, is observed to this day in the village of Eyam, and in most other villages and little towns in the Peak, with paper garlands hung, In memory of some village youth, or maid, Draw the soft tear, from thrill'd remembrance sprung, How oft my childhood mark'd that tribute paid. The gloves, suspended by the garland's side, White as its snowy flowers, with ribbons tied;— Dear Village, long these wreaths funereal spread, Simple memorials of thy early dead! But O! thou blank, and silent pulpit!—thou, That with a Father's precepts, just, and bland, Did'st win my ear, as reason's strength'ning glow Show'd their full value, now thou seem'st to stand Before my sad, suffus'd, and trembling gaze, The dreariest relic of departed days. Of eloquence paternal, nervous, clear, Dim Apparition thou—and bitter is my tear! REMONSTRANCE ADDRESSED TO WILLIAM COWPER, ESQ. IN 1788, ON THE SARCASMS LEVELLED AT NATIONAL GRATITUDE IN THE TASK. These verses were not sent to Mr Cowper, on account of the reported depression on his spirits, and were during his lifetime, for the same reason, with-held from the press. “I would not enter The line and half, with which this poem opens, are taken from the Task. So says its author of those who feel no pang of conscience for having set their foot upon a noisome reptile. on my list of friends, “Tho' grac'd with polish'd manners,” tho' endow'd With talents destin'd to immortal fame, But wanting generosity, the man Who darts the blighting of satiric wit, Lanc'd from a spleenful heart, or sullen weaves The dark anathemas of Calvin's school Against a nation's praise, its grateful praise, Pour'd for the assiduous culture of those gifts Bestow'd by Heaven,—not on the general mind, But on the chosen Few, ordain'd to prove In what full portion to the human soul God can impart intelligence; the rays Destin'd to stream from their eternal source Through future ages. O'er each feeling heart Shed they not transport which allays each ill, Sickness, and pain, and sorrow; lift the mind, Seating its pleasures high, till waste expense And frivolous pursuits, fatigue or pall, While all the grosser train of sensual joys Prove vapid as they are guilty?—Read we not On Inspiration's page, “Who loves not man Whom he hath seen, how should he love his God, Yet unbeheld?” So he, who would repress The fervent tribute of each thankful heart For true delights and pure, receiv'd from Man, May fear his Maker, but will never know The nobler piety, that fits the soul For happiness and Heaven. O! wintry Spirit, Hurling thine icy bolt of sarcasm See the invidious ridicule of the Stratford jubilee in the 6th Book of the Task, a poem whose descriptive powers are always admirable, and whose morality and piety are often sublime. Against the loveliest and most generous rites That e'er an honest, grateful nation paid At the bright shrine of Genius! Look'st thou back With grudging eyes The use of that word here has been objected to, as too low an expression and unmusical; but surely it had been unwise to have expunged it, because it may be familiar in the dialect of our peasantry, since the English vocabulary has no word which would exactly give its meaning in the two passages where it occurs in the Remonstrance. Learned men have asserted, that grudge has no precise synonime in any language. Its harsh sound, where an harsh feeling is to be expressed, cannot be a just objection. Neither the words envious, or malignant, nor yet unwilling, or reluctant, convey its perfect meaning. The two first are too strong, the second not strong enough. Grudge is a word so peculiar in its signification, that it should not be banished from serious poetry. It stands between unwillingness that our neighbour should possess a certain good, and hating, or envying him its possession. Grudge denotes a feeling stronger than reluctance, yet less bitter than hatred, less vile than envy; and finally, it has been used by our best writers in their serious strains, as the authorities in Johnson's Dictionary prove. If false refinement has rejected any word, the loss of which cannot with precision be supplied, and which has no indecent meaning, those who wish rather to write nervously than nicely, should endeavour, by using it themselves, to recall the exile. Cowper, in the Task, has the word grudge twice, see book iii, page 119, first edition. on those applausive hours When Poesy and Music, with twin'd arms, Attended jubilant?—to Avon's bank From the remotest confines of our isle, Her silver shores, and mast-aspiring towns, Her tower'd cities and her villa'd hills, Her lakes, her rivers, and her golden vales, Summon'd those glowing votaries, who with hearts Exulting in their country's proudest boast, And by the patriot passion taller grown, Stood tiptoe on Avona's brink, and there Strew'd all the rifled Summer's bloomy stores; The incense of the warmer Orient toss'd; Pour'd in loud paeans the triumphant song, And from the cup, carv'd from the hallow'd tree, Sprinkled the bright libation; tree, that fell At the harsh dictate of a kindred mind, Gastril, who having bought the premises on which it stood, cut down Shakespear's mulberry tree, inhospitably to preclude the request of travellers to pay visits of poetic veneration to the tree planted by the great poet of England. Kindred in spleen, though much unlike in power, To thine, Misanthropist! Nor singly rose This murmur, cold and dreary as the rill That ink-like huddles through the russet moor, Powerless to fertilize. Lo! in a strain Vide 6th Book of the Task. Fanatic and illiberal as the lay Maligning Avon's festival, thou scorn'st Thy country, marshalling in holy shrines The harmonic strength of Europe, to fulfil The great designs Briarean Handel plann'd; “Strong in new arms, lo! giant Handel stands, “Like bold Briareus with his hundred hands!” He certainly composed his Oratorios for a band whose complete number the comparative fewness of musical performers rendered then unattainable. That mighty, matchless German, who attun'd His lyre seraphic to thy native tongue!— Thou heard'st with grudging and disgusted ear Those great designs attain'd, when, thro' the aisles Of the vast ancient fane, in torrents burst Those floods of harmony, that lift the soul Upon their swelling and tumultuous waves Up to the Throne of God.—O! what is Virtue, If praise of those, who thus their talents ten Ardent improv'd, is folly, or is vice? The appropriation of those sums to charitable purposes which were collected at the Handelian commemorations, places the injustice of Cowper's sarcasm upon a level with its absurdity, accusing them, as it does, of a profane and idolatrous tendency. Nor only on the wreaths for Genius twined Fall the deep shadows of this Cynic spleen; Mark how ungenerous the beauteous strain See latter part of the first book of the Task. The episode begins, But far above the rest, and with most cause I pity thee.— Closes, that sings the desolate of heart, Forlorn Omai, on his native hills Wandering, with eyes that search the watry waste “For sight of ship from England!”—why pollute Thy lovely requiem to his vanish'd joys With heartless taunt on the illustrious band That led him hither, and restor'd him back, At his kind, natural wish, that nobly sprung From patriot love, too probably, alas! Requited ill, and pregnant with the pangs Of fruitless, stung regret. Was it for gain That those illustrious Chiefs, with daring hand, Rais'd the pale curtains of the southern Pole?— Loth as thou art to credit human worth, O! Bard unjust! thou know'st that not for gold, Gems, or false glory, they explor'd and brav'd Climes dangerous and unknown; but to diffuse The blessings mild of cultivated life Amid the perilous and lonely haunts Of the lugubrious savage, straying slow, Silent and comfortless, o'er pathless wastes Torrid, or frore. Thus on the worth, that rose Its nation's honour, thy immortal muse, Which should record it to succeeding times, For the bright, fostering dews of just applause, Sheds cankerous scorn. And was it not enough To impute to every wild and idle weed Of human frailty, such envenom'd juice As slowly circles through thy latent veins, Death-giving hemlock?—Was not that enough, Without enlisting a much favour'd muse Against Just Praise, the spur of great designs, And O! twice blest, like Mercy? Was thy lyre Thus highly gifted for such warfare rude? For notes, O! how unlike the strains that stole From the sweet harp of Jesse's pitying son, Before whose kind, assuasive, melting tones Flew the despair which spread her raven-wing O'er the sunk spirit of Saul!—Thee, Bard morose, Churlish amid thy fancy's golden stores, Thee will I teach, censorious as thou art, What is not Virtue. Listen to my verse; Confute it if thou canst;—if not, admit The force of Truth, though rushing from a lyre Less richly strung, less solemn than thine own! It was not—is not—and can ne'er be virtue, Merely from terror to abstain from vice; Merely to sigh for sufferings, which result From proud unfeeling Man's abuse of power, Careless, or rancorous;—nor yet to seize The rod of indignation, to chastise The vanities and follies of mankind With that asperity, which ill becomes A fellow-mortal frail.—'Tis not to check, With cynic sneer, that fervour of the soul, Which, grateful for the transport Genius gives, Praises the unwearied culture of its powers, God's gift magnificent. No, sacred Virtue, These constitute thee not;—for O 'tis thine With soft compassion's pleading eye to look, And with benign allowance, on each fault Not wearing crime's dark hue, though thee thyself No such weak errors taint. It is to hope Much from the mercy of a parent judge On him he made so frail.—It is to know That all thou see'st of selfish, light, and vain, Far less of sin possesses, than the pride, Rigid and drear, which shuts the censor's heart Against construction charitable; against Tender indulgence.—'Tis to love, applaud, And emulate, whatever has its rise In glad fraternal kindness, and the power Of gratitude, dispersing by its glow Envy, and Hate, and Fear, which darkling roam That man's cold mind, who feels another's right To Fame's bright wreath, yet brings no votive flower. Now, if disdainful of my humble verse, It soften not the Satirist's marble breast, O! may he listen to an higher strain, A strain of Inspiration, and it breathes No precept hostile to my lays!—but list, List, I adjure thee! since it much imports Thy welfare temporal, and eternal!—try The censures harsh of thy stern muse, who oft As with the tongue of missive angels speaks, Try them by test unerring, by the Voice Which sounding brass and tinkling cimbal call'd The human, and angelic strains combin'd, If wanting Charity;—there should they fail, Thy censures harsh to that pure ordeal brought, Reform them, and grow social, just, and kind, Reform them, and be happy!—With firm hand Disroot thy bosom's hemlock!—there it grows, Dark spots denote the weed, illiberal spleen, Adverse to praise, however nobly earn'd, Where latent hope of a reward on high Prompts not its fervour; sullen, bigot-pride, Hating for errors, less perhaps than thine. Since on that anxious and indignant brow Genius has long her amaranthine crown Exulting placed, may they, who hold their torch High o'er the paths of Peace, Daughters of Heaven, Star-pointing Hope, and meek-voic'd Charity, Clear that gloom'd brow, illume those eyes severe, Solicitous, and sad!—O, clasp the veil Mild Charity extends, of sky-wove grain, Blessing the hand, which gently lets it fall Upon a brother's frailty! From thy hand When thus it may descend, immortal Hope Shall, with her silver anchor, thy void grasp Smiling supply, and, upward soaring, chase Terror's black clouds, and to thy gladden'd view Disclose the realms of Everlasting Light! When this Remonstrance to Cowper was written, its author only knew him in his publications. Mr Hayley's Biography of that unfortunate man softens, by excited pity, the indignation which had arisen from the ungenerous passages reprobated here;—but the delineation of Cowper's character, and the records of his life, compared with the illiberal censures which disgrace the interesting and beautiful pages of the Task, teach us, more than ever, to deplore the dire Calvinistic principles, which ruined his peace, and which could so freeze and narrow a heart, which Nature had made warm and expansive. They taught him to anathematize for departed genius, sublimer and more extensive than his own, Shakespear and Handel, that praise for the magnificent talents they had cultivated, which his published letters prove him to have been desirous to obtain for his own poetry. March 1806. CRUGAL's GHOST, APPEARING TO CONNAL, —FROM OSSIAN. This, and the ensuing version, are not calculated for the admirers of Ossian. Those who have a true taste for him, in the simple grandeur of the translation in solemn prose, will think, with the author of this Miscellany, that the most sonorous rhyme and best constructed measure cannot improve his poetic charms. But there are people of genius, who have fervent taste for lyric excellence, that consider poetry, divested of measure, as bombastic prose. Influenced by that prejudice, they perceive neither grandeur nor beauty in the awful and striking imagery of the old Bard. The author of the above paraphrase, convinced that the songs of Ossian contain poetic matter, potent to elevatc and render beautiful, any mode of composition, here tries the effect of that, in which Pope has given us a still more ancient Bard than Ossian. The passages very well bear being detached, and form in themselves a perfect whole. She thinks the ghosts of Cruoal, and Cuchullin, vie in sublime and mournful grace with those of Patroclus and of Hector—with that of Margaret in the exquisite ballad, and almost with the Spirit, in the Book of Job, which passed before the eyes of Eliphaz, amid the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men. Lull'd by the dashing of the mountain stream, Beneath the aged tree, in quiet dream, Brave Connal lies. A stone with moss o'erspread, Forms a grey pillow for the warrior's head. At distance from the Chiefs he seeks repose; The race of Colgar fear no treacherous foes. Shrill as the winds o'er heathy Lena sweep, He hears the voice of night assail his sleep; And waking, marks a gleam of dusky red Glide down the hill, and reach his mossy bed. Young Crugal's semblance hovers in the ray, Fall'n in the slaughter of that deathful day. His face, is like the moon in shrouding rains; His robes, the clouds, that rise from marshy plains; Gleam, like decaying flames, his eyes around, And dart upon his breast the livid wound! As mortal visitant, with life-blood warm, The dauntless chief accosts the shadowy form. “Fam'd on the hill of Deer, what chance has led “The valiant Crugal to my mossy bed? “Ah! why so pale?—that never knew'st to yield, “Son of the hill, and breaker of the shield!” The airy head low bending, as in grief, One dim hand stretch'd o'er the recumbent chief, A wailful sound the bloodless lips exhale, Thin as the reedy Lego's rising gale. “Wide o'er its native hills my ghost has stray'd, “But my pale corse on Ullin's shore is laid. “No more wilt thou with Crugal commune kind, “Or on the heath his lonely steps shalt find; “My trackless feet through fields of air have past, “Light as high Cromla's ever-whistling blast. “But, O! my warning voice may Connal mark! “I see the cloud of death descending dark; “O'er Lena's plain it hovers!—Erin's hosts “Must fall!—fly, Connal, from the field of ghosts!” He sighs!—and, like the darken'd moon, retires Amid his whistling blast, and meteor fires. “Stay,” cries the valiant Connal, “Crugal stay, “Son of the windy hill, and meteor-ray! “What mountain-cave has thy pale corse possest? “What green cliff blossoms o'er thy house of rest? “Shall not thy voice in wintry storms arise? “Shall we not hear it in the torrent's noise, “When feeble children of the wind come forth, “And shriek amid the tempests of the north? Rising he moves, with rapid step, and light, His armour ringing to the blast of night; Speeds to the heroes, slumbering on the field, And o'er Cuchullin strikes the clanging shield. “Why, (says the ruler of the car,) why come “The steps of Connal through the midnight-gloom? “Against the alarming sound my spear might turn, “And his slain friend the rash Cuchullin mourn.” ‘Rever'd Cuchullin, Chief of deathless fame, ‘To my late rest the ghost of Crugal came. ‘Dim through his form the midnight stars appear'd, ‘And like a distant stream his voice I heard. ‘Upon my startled ear it slowly broke, ‘And of the dark and narrow dwelling spoke, ‘For this he glided o'er the marshy heath, ‘The voice of woe, the messenger of death!— ‘For peace, or truce, O chief of Dunsaick, try, ‘Or o'er the heath of Lena instant fly.’ Then, gravely smiling, with intrepid air, Replies the dauntless ruler of the war. “He spoke to us of death's impending storm, “Though stars dim twinkled thro' his misty form!— “Connal, the rising gales, that murmur'd near, “From Lena's cavern rush'd upon thine ear;— “Or if it was thy Crugal's semblance pale, “Why not to me impart the deathful tale? “Thee did he teach his cave of rest to find, “His narrow house, that feeble son of wind! “My sword might penetrate its dark retreat, “And force his knowledge from its secret seat. “But small that knowledge, he was here to-day;— “Knew'st thou he swell'd the slaughter of the fray? “Scarce o'er these hills his ghost has wing'd its flight, “Who there could tell him we should fall in fight?” ‘Yet heed the warning voice, brave Connal cries! ‘On the swift gale each warrior's spirit flies; ‘They dwell together in their gloomy cave, ‘Talk of the fate of Chiefs, the hero's grave.’ “Of other Chiefs—but let them ne'er presume “To waste prediction on Cuchullin's doom! “May in their caves my fate neglected lie!— “The Chief of Erin was not born to fly! “I will not fly from Swaran!—if I fall, “Swift shall my spirit seek their airy hall; “My tomb, in years of future fame, shall rise, “Sought by the brave, and hallow'd by their sighs; “On my cold stone the hunter's tear descend, “And sorrowing o'er it fair Bragela bend.— “I fear not death,—but fear ignoble flight, “Stain of the youthful warrior's former might!— “Oft has great Fingal, from his rapid car, “Seen conquest mine amid the rage of war.— “Dim phantom of the hill, appear to me! “Shew in thy livid hand my death's decree; “No thought of flight shall thy pale doom inspire, “Son of the whistling blast, the meteor-fire! “Go, Connal, loudly strike the high-hung shield, “From yon riv'd oak dark shadowing on the field; “Peace is not in the sound.—My Chiefs shall hear, “Start from their sleep, and snatch the prostrate spear.— “Though Fingal yet no promis'd aid fulfils, “Nor leads his heroes from their stormy hills, “Yet, Son of Colgar, will we scorn to fly, “But nobly conquer, or as nobly die!” THE GHOST OF CUCHULLIN. FROM OSSIAN. On Dora's hill, the fires of parting day, With soften'd lustre, shed the yellow ray; Yet scarce thy sunk behind the mountain's breast Ere gathering storms the fading scene invest. Loud hollow gales fell murmuring on the floods, And shook Temora through his bending woods. One ample cloud a sable curtain rear'ds, And faint, behind its edge, a red star peer'd, And in its shade a tall, unreal form Stalk'd through the air, and mourn'd amid the storm. His lengthen'd steps o'er the vast mountain pass'd, And his broad shield a pale effulgence cast. Too well Cuchullin's faded form I knew, Yet, ere my lips could breathe their last adieu, Swift, on his howling blast, away he strode, And night, and horror, gather'd on the wood. EPISTLE TO Mr Newton, the Derbyshire Minstrel, ON RECEIVING HIS DESCRIPTION, IN VERSE, OF AN AUTUMNAL SCENE, NEAR EYAM, IN THAT COUNTY, SEPTEMBER, 1791. High on the airy mountain's sunny side, On the rais'd heath-bush, gay in purple pride, You seat me, Edwin, where you sat serene, And with the pen of Genius sketch'd the scene; Taught his bold lines each feature wild to trace, Each rude magnificence, each sylvan grace; Vast barren hills, and deep luxuriant dales, That the sun gilds, the volant cloud half veils, Alternate. Ah! no spot recorded then, No distant valley, and no nearer glen, That twining Wye's cerulean current laves, Or yellow Derwent with his frothing waves; No rock, no hamlet, on the mountain's swell, No village, nestling in the shadowy dell, But, as I meet their lov'd, familiar name, Swift, as the lightning's penetrating flame, To my charm'd soul return her morning years, Their transports heighten'd, and dispell'd their cares. Thus on the spirit Memory's local spell No time can weaken, and no change repel; It melts the heart, and rushes through the brain, With pleasure, sweeter for the mingled pain. What heart but feels that pain, that pleasure's strife, Oft as it traces back the maze of life! But O! where warm the ingenuous passions glow, That avarice, pride, nor wild ambition know, This local spell!—how instant is it's power, To chase the Present, and the Past restore! Scotland, than thine, what poets more endear Their native scenes, and send our spirits there? Ah! when they sing of Tay, of Forth, and Clyde, Of Leader-Haughs, and Yarrow's flowery side, Their strains my heart with softer rapture fire Than Mason's, Gray's, or Darwin's lays inspire; Their loftier rhyme though loftier Genius taught, Glow in their image, and sublime their thought. And when you, Edwin, bid description's truth Recall the scenes that charm'd my early youth, I feel these eyes suffus'd by gushing tears, While through their crystal shine my happier years, Fair as the Spring's first flowers, and verdant fields, Seen through the illumin'd rains departing April yields. TO Mr JOHN SALT, of LICHFIELD, Since Dr Salt, of Birmingham. ON HAVING READ SOME OF HIS COMPOSITIONS ON A RAINY EVENING, IN AUGUST, 1789. Late on a sullen Summer night Thy intellectual morning hung; I mark'd its dawn with calm delight, Whose vivid, soft, and dewy ray, From the rich orb of Genius sprung, Each adolescent grace among, Gives lovely promise of a golden day. But, leaving metaphoric lays, Let me, ingenuous Youth, impart, Warm in the glow of honest praise, Fond, local hopes to see thy name Increase the claims to classic art, Philosophy and high desert, That raise thy Lichfield to the heights of Fame. ON THE SUDDEN DEATH OF THE CELEBRATED Mr NORRIS, of OXFORD, BATCHELOR OF MUSIC. He died September the 3d, 1790, the week after he had conducted the Musical Festival, at Birmingham. He sung in the New Church in that town, “Thy rebuke hath broken his heart,” from the Messiah, with great feeling, after he had been treated with cruel disrespect by a part of his audience the preceding evening, who hissed, on a mistaken supposition that he was intoxicated, when they saw him so much oppressed by a song of parental woe, in Jeptha, that he was unable to finish it. Instant the mortal stroke the warbler smote! Eternal silence seals the tuneful throat! Ah, Norris, thine! whom Albion heard so long Pour in impressive tones the hallow'd song, With all thy Handel's glorious page inspires, Pathos that melts, and energy that fires. High o'er the numerous band we saw him late, Saw choirs combin'd his graceful mandate wait; And heard the too, too applicable lay His drooping spirit's mild complaint convey Of that injurious, that ungrateful sound, Which the shock'd ear with ruthless force could wound, For that his trembling nerves, oppress'd with pain, Whelm'd in resistless tears one tender strain. Oh, when that powerful voice, in peals of praise, Led the loud chorus through the harmonic maze, Breath'd the pathetic song, that on the breast Religious awe, and contrite grief imprest, How little we divin'd, who heard ere while His full notes floating through the vaulted aisle, That death's dark clouds around the minstrel hung, That the sweet Swan his own sad requiem sung! ON MAJOR ANDRE. SERIOUS EPIGRAM TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH. It is gratifying to see this tribute of generous eulogy paid to the memory of a gallant, unfortunate English officer, by a Frenchman, whose nation was at war with ours, at the period of Major Andre's death. In youth's gay bloom illustrious André died, Flower of a day, nipt by the wintry storm; His heart strung high by valour's noblest pride, His mien with love's seducing ardour warm. Glory, in characters of living gold, Writes on his sacred shrine the patriot name, And one Great Act, which bids e'en warriors old Thank its example for their fresh-earn'd fame. HAROLD's COMPLAINT. The author put this Ode into verse, December 1790, from the prose inserted below. In 1797, it appeared, translated by Mr Mason, in his third volume of poems, then given to the world. His translation, inverting the order of Harold's triumphs, produces anti-climax, a defect from which the original is free. After the boast of defeating a mighty army, and of having slain their leader, it is bathos to exult in the feats of riding, rowing, swimming, skating, &amp;c. A SCANDINAVIAN ODE. FROM DR ALEXANDER'S HISTORY OF WOMEN. “The Scandinavian women were chaste, proud, and tenacious of their lover's glory, despising such as spent their life in obscurity. We, therefore, often find an hero minutely detailing his accomplishments, and pursuits, to the object of his passion, as in the following Ode of Harold the Valiant.”— See Alexander's History of Women. I One day, while on the Ocean blue “One day we were but sixteen in a vessel. “A storm arose, and swelled the sea. It filled the “loaded ship, but we diligently cleared it away. Thence I “formed hopes of the happiest success in love—but a Russian “maiden scorns me. “I know how to perform eight exercises. I dart the lance. “I sit firmly on horseback—I tune the pipe—I lead the “dances—I am inured to swimming—I am skilful at the oar— “I know how to run along the ice with skates—I fight vali. “antly;—and yet a Russian maiden scorns me. “I was born in the high country of Norway, where the inhabitants “handle their bows so well, but I preferred guiding “my ships amidst the rocks of the ocean, far from the habitations “of men. I have run through all the seas with my vessels “—and yet a Russian maiden scorns me. “My ships have made the tour of Sicily—we were all magnificent “and splendid. My brown vessel, full of mariners, “rapidly rowed to the utmost extent of my wishes. Wholly “taken up with war, I thought my course would never slacken, “and yet a Russian maiden scorns me. “Can she deny that on the great day when, posted near “the city, I joined the battle, and fought against the people “of Drontheim? Their troops trebled ours; it was a dreadful “conflict. I valiantly handled my arms, and left behind me “lasting monuments of my exploits. I left the renowned “king of Drontheim breathless on the field, and yet a Russian “maiden scorns me.” The glittering sun-beams pour, With vessel light, and scanty crew, We gaily left the shore. Black rose the storm, and in the hold The frothing waters lay, But toil their whelming force controul'd, And clear'd them all away. Then swift we flew before the wind, And gain'd the distant isle; The omen fair I hop'd to find Of beauteous Aura's smile; But yet, my toils, though fortune crown, Has all I love forsworn me, My constancy sustains her frown, The Russian maiden scorns me. II In manly sports, and manly toils, Twice four, I proudly shine, And kinder nymphs, with rosy smiles, For me the garlands twine. 'Tis mine to dart the gleaming lance; To curb the bounding steed; To tune the pipe, the mazy dance, With graceful step, to lead; To ply the oar, to rove the deep, And, o'er the frozen wave, On volant steel, like winds, to sweep; To meet in fight the brave; But ah, though great in arts and arms, From love's blest hope she warns me, Not all my well-won glory charms, A Russian maiden scorns me. III On Norway's wintry mountains high My natal morn arose, Whose sons can teach their shafts to fly, Unerring from their bows: But o'er the lone sea bends my course, The bounding ship I guide, Where, 'mid vast rocks, with fatal force, Surges the confluent tide. On every sea my flying sails The rising winds have caught, And though to tempest swell'd the gales, No sheltering harbour sought; But ah! though courage speed my prow, And subject seas have borne me, A frozen heart impels, I know, The Russian maid to scorn me. IV Around Calabria's winding shore My dark ships grandly ride, With mariners, a numerous store, Their youthful leader's pride. Devoted to the clang of arms, Victorious in their strife, I gloried in their loud alarms, And liv'd a warrior's life: Nor dreamt that long indulgent Fate Would ever cloud her brow, And with a peevish woman's hate, My fondest hopes o'erthrow. Now rival chiefs my woes deride, And generous friendship mourns me; Hates (while it chides my vanquish'd pride,) The Russian maid that scorns me. V O! wou'd this charming maid recall The wonders of that day, When near the southern city's wall, I join'd the bloody fray; When Drontheim's armies trebled ours, And thunder'd o'er the plain, While every wave its river pours Ran purple to the main; When conquest, on her eagle-wing, Flew hovering o'er my shield, And Drontheim's long-resistless king Lay breathless on the field; Yet, yet, to blight my youth with cares, Has all I love forsworn me, The garland of the war she tears, The Russian maiden scorns me. THE LAKE; OR MODERN IMPROVEMENT IN LANDSCAPE. Grand, ancient, gothic, mark this ample dome, Of fashion's slave, the uncongenial home! Long have its turrets braved the varying clime, And mock'd the ravage of relentless time. The owner shrugs his shoulders, and deplores One vile effect of his self-squander'd stores, That the triste edifice must still remain To shock his lordship's gaze, and blot the plain; That no gay villa may supply its place, Rise in Italian, or in Gallic grace. “But, yet,” he cries, “by Fashion's aid divine, “Rescued from sylvan shrouds, my scenes may shine; “Resistless goddess, to thy votary come, “And chace the horrors of this leafy gloom!” She comes!—the gaudy despot stands confest, Known by her mien assur'd, and motley vest; The vest, mistaken by her servile train For beauty's robe of sky-enwoven grain, Deck'd with each varying form, each living hue, That Nature hallow'd, and her Repton drew. Scorning their power, and reckless of expense, The foe of beauty, and the bane of sense; Close by my lord, and with strange projects warm, Stalks o'er the scenes her edicts shall deform. “Yon broad, brown wood, now darkening to the sky, “Shall prostrate soon with perish'd branches lie; “Yield golden treasures for our great design, “Till all the scene one glassy surface shine.” Mid shrubs, and tangled grass, with sparkling waves, A little vagrant brook the valley laves; Now hid, now seen, the wanton waters speed, Hurrying loquacious o'er their pebbly bed. “A Lake! she cries, this source can never fail, “A lake shall fill our undulating dale! “No more the dingles shall sink dark and deep, “No waving hedgerows round the meadows sweep; “All must be Lake this level lawn between, “And those bare hills, and rocks, that form the screen, “Peer o'er the yet proud woods, and close the scene.” What recks it her that, many a tedious year, Barren and bleak its naked banks appear! Since, tho' the pliant Naiad swiftly pours Her urn exhaustless to receding shores, Sullen and tardy found, the Dryad train Are still, thro' circling seasons, woo'd in vain, Ere the dusk umbrage shall luxuriant flow, And shadowy tremble o'er the lake below; Which curtain'd thus, changes its leaden hue, Rising a silver mirror to the view. See, at the pert behest, subservient toil Plough with the victim woods the echoing soil! See, the forced flood th' o'erwhelmed valley laves, O'er fields, lanes, thickets, spread the silent waves!— No lively hue of spring they know to wear, No gorgeous glow of the consummate year; No tinge that gold-empurpled autumn spreads O'er the rich woodland, sloping from the meads, But stagnant, mute, unvarying, cold, and pale, They meet the winter-wind, and summer-gale. Between the base of yonder gothic pile, Whose towers frown sullen o'er the wat'ry spoil, And the chill lake's uncomfortable breast, Lo! on the lawn, with venerable crest, A few old oaks defend the tired survey, In part, from that dull pool's eternal grey; While, gleaming, underneath their darksome boughs, With better grace the torpid water shows. Again the dame her swarthy agents calls, Raised is the ready axe—and—ah! it falls! They who had seen whole centuries roll away, No more half-veil the lake, and mitigate the day. Too late the slumbering Genius of the scene Starts from his mossy couch, with wilder'd mien; Dismay'd beholds, and all too late to save, His graces destined to a watery grave; His winding brook, green wood, and mead and dell, His grassy lanes, and moss-encircled well; And for the guardian oaks, now prostrate laid, His winter screen, his sultry summer's shade, Sees the weak saplings, dotted on the lawn, With dark and clumsy fence around them drawn, Warp in the noon-tide ray, with shrivell'd rind, And shrink, and tremble in the rising wind. In vain he curses the fantastic power, And the pale ravage of her idiot-hour; But no vindictive ire the spell revokes, Fall'n are the woods, and lawn-adorning oaks! Fled every varied charm boon Nature gave, No green field blossoms, and no hedge-rows wave! On the dim waters nods the useless sail, And Eurus howls along the deluged vale. His reign usurp'd, since Time can ne'er restore, Indignant rising to return no more, His eyes concealing with one lifted hand, Shadowing the waters, as his wings expand, The injured Genius seeks the dstant coast, Like Abdiel, flying from the rebel host. WRITTEN AFTER HAVING VISITED MISS MORE, AND HER SISTERS AT COWSLIP GREEN, NEAR BRISTOL, IN AUGUST 1791. Fair, silent scene, soft rising in the vale, By mountains guarded from each stormy gale, Long, 'mid thy sloping lawn, and winding glade, And mossy cell, for contemplation made, Be seen, in health and peace, the virgin train, Led by the boast of Britain's tuneful plain, Where Genius oft has fed its kindling fires, Roll'd the rapt eye, and struck the golden wires, Bristol; that hears her More's distinguish'd name Wafted, by echoes, round the shrine of Fame. On whose mild brow she sees bright laurels twine, Cull'd from their choicest bowers by all the nine, Enwreath'd with charity's assuasive balm, And faith, and virtue's never-dying palm. And ye, sweet satellites, that gently bear Your lesser radiance round this beamy star, Aiding her pious efforts to impart Religion's lustre Mrs H.

See Mason's quarto edition of Gray's Poems and Letters, published 1775, page 168. Thus far my youth has labour'd to explore The springs of thought, and Nature's mystic lore; No languid votary of the Muse I came, To trace her footsteps up the steeps of Fame; To bid the streams, that Roman fountains yield, Flow in full currents o'er Britannia's field. Ah, lov'd Favonius, who those labours shared, Whose voice could animate, whose praise reward; The prop, the stimulus of all my powers, On thee the rayless cloud incumbent lours; There, my fond grasp thy fading form evades, Sunk, and involv'd in death's eternal shades. Friend of my youth, O! with what pangs I found The gloomy mists of sickness gathering round! Saw thy heart struggling with convulsive throes, That heart, so quick to feel for others' woes! Saw, in dire progress, fell disease prevail, Dim thy clear eye, thy vivid colour pale; Saw numbing languor steal each youthful garce, From those light limbs, from that expressive face, Where piety sublime, affections mild, And all the soul of truth ingenuous smiled. Yet once, O once! the flattering foe of life Seem'd to recede, and quit the cruel strife; Then did my grateful vows ascend the skies, Then did bright hopes anticipating rise, That we again thro' classic groves shou'd stray, And mutually deceive the tardy day. Ah, hopes presumptuous!—ah ungranted pray'rs! Ah, helpless efforts!—and ah, wasted cares! Ah, mournful hours, condemn'd to lasting pain, To sighs incessant, and to anguish vain! But thou, dear shade, to whom superfluous flows This bitter flood of unavailing woes, Full bliss enjoy the starry plains among, In the pure ether whence thy essence sprung! And if, beyond misfortune's icy blight, Pitying, thou bendest from thy throne of light, To view the turbulence of human fate, Rash love, and envy, fear, and pride, and hate, Behold these griefs! that, desolate of heart, Pierc'd by deprived affection's rankling dart, Amid the silence of the lonely hour, To thee, O long belov'd! to thee I pour! More is not mine to give, since now remains But the sad luxury of these cherish'd pains, Casting their fruitless wail, their hopeless tear To thy dumb ashes, and thy timeless bier! PARAPHRASE of GRAY's ALCAICK ODE, written in the ALBUM OF THE GRAND CHARTREUSE, on his way back to england, after having visited the italian cities with mr walpole. This attempt is boldly paraphrastic. It appeared to the translator that Gray must mean more than he has, at least, perspicuously expressed, when he says, in this latin ode, that “the sublime scenery round the Chartreuse inspires him with more religious reverence than the statues of Phitias, adorned with gold.” Strange indeed, if it did not; since, though such objects may excite admiration of human skill, they have no obvious tendency to inspire devotion. Surely that was saying too little for those awful monuments of their Creator's power, which inevitably lift the serious and feeling heart to its God. The above English version ventures to make the poet say what he must have meant;—that he there more powerfully feels the presence of the Deity, than amid the pomp of the Romish altars, adorned with pictures, and statues, steaming with incense, and blazing with gold. The translator also takes the liberty to add another, and more pious idea to that, with which Gray's latin ode some what abruptly concludes. Hail, guardian of this deep severe retreat, Divine Religion! by whatever name Thou would'st my lips thy sacred power should greet: No common power these solemn scenes proclaim. Here, 'mid the desert cliffs that sternly frown, O'er trackless mountains as my slow step roves, These giant rocks, that waving pines embrown, These roaring waters, and this night of groves, To my aw'd spirit, and my throbbing heart Plainer a present Deity disclose, Than Raphael tints, or Phidian forms impart When bright with gold the fragrant altar glows. Hail, solemn scenes! and to my wearied mind Your sheltering shades, your placid quiet yield; But O! should fate deny my youth to find In your wrapt silence a protecting shield, Swift should she bear me to the vortex wild, By human strife in storms perpetual whirl'd, Grant me, kind Heaven, some climate lone and mild, Some vale sequester'd from the struggling world! Where, free from vulgar tumults of the vain, Calm I may feel my vital powers decay, And all unvex'd, at least by mental pain, Meet the long night with hope of endless day! In his edition of his friend's works Mason observes, that this latin poem is “marked with some of the finest touches of Gray's melancholy muse. The extreme gloom and disgust to the world, breathed through its stanzas, probably resulted from his disagreement with Mr Walpole, which occasioned his premature return to England.” Gray's letters thus describe the situation of the grand Chartreuse:—“We “proceeded on horses which are used to the way, up the “mountain of the Chartreuse. It is six miles to the top; the “road winds up it, generally not six feet broad. On one “hand, rocks, with woods of pine-trees hanging over their “heads; on the other, a monstrous precipice, almost perpendicular, “at the bottom of which rolls a torrent, that sometimes “tumbling amongst the fragments of stone, which have “fallen from above, and somet mes precipitating itself down “vast descents, with noise like thunder, which is still increased “by the echoes from the mountains on each side, concurs “to form one of the most awful, the most romantic, the most “astonishing scenes I ever beheld. Add to this, the strange “views made by the cliffs and craggs on the other hand, “which in many places throw themselves from the summit “down to the vale, and the river below, and you will conclude “we had no occasion to repent our pains.” TO Sir NIGEL GRESLEY. APOLOGY FOR NOT ACCEPTING HIS INVITATION TO A MASQUERADE-BALL AT HIS SEAT, DRAKELOW, IN STAFFORDSHIRE. Ah, Gresley! skill'd to deck the festal rite With Taste's coy art, and Fancy's various light, Charm'd when the summon'd train forsake their home, Grotesque and gay, to fleet beneath thy dome; Could I, amid the jocund band, convene Youth, health, or spirit, to the glittering scene, Then should my pen thy flattering passport greet With gladden'd heart, and with acceptance meet; But long-precarious health, life's faded bloom, And recent ravage of the ruthless tomb, Clos'd o'er my friends, forbid the pageant bowers To shine before me with magnetic powers. When graver Pleasures, and domestic Mirth, Rise the soft Lares of that glowing hearth, Where Drakelow, white as o'er the vale she gleams, Eyes her fair form in Trent's pellucid streams, Mine may it be to share the joys benign, More grateful to existence' dim decline; To view expanding mind, with effluence warm, Illume thy lov'd Maria's Miss Gresley, then fourteen, Sir Nigel's eldest daughter. youthful form; To mark around that ever liberal board, Bless'd by glad welcome from its graceful lord, With sportive glee his lovely infants sit, And bright Louisa Miss Louisa Gresley, Sir Nigel's sister, since Mrs William Gresley. lance the darts of wit; While most his sense and spirit render gay The golden leisure of the social day. TO ?SHERIVE, Esq. STUDENT AT OXFORD. When Sherive breathes, the classic bowers among, For me the honours of the plausive song, He wakes the hope, that dormant long had lain, Sunk amid life's dull cares, and grief, and pain; The hope, that yet my verse-encircled themes, Buoyant may rise above oblivion's streams, While still the guiding star of praise benign Shall o'er the cold and darkling waters shine. SONNET, to the Rev. RICHARD POLWHELE, ON HIS POEM UPON THE INFLUENCE OF LOCAE ATTACHMENT. That ingenious and learned gentleman had seen his charming Poem absurdly and arrogantly criticised by one of the periodical Censors. Amidst other utterly groundless objections, he accused the poet of unlicensed and affected verbalism, instancing particularly the words slumberous, and memorize. For both, Johnson shews the high authority of Shakespear, Milton, and Pope; and for the latter, a prose sentence of eminent beauty by Wotton, thus:—“Let their lives, which were bravely lost, be memorized on the full tablets of time.” After accusing Mr Polwhele of affectation in using them, the critic proceeds to assert that such expressions have the effect of a November fog, in completely annihilating every thing like sense and beauty in a composition. Now, it is evident, that were they as unhappily, as, in fact, they are happily used, their mal-influence could extend only to the sentence in which they are found; and since he cannot deny that they are clearly intelligible, at least, it is impossible they can have the obscuring effect of a fog, even upon that single sentence. The critic who could use such an inapplicable metaphor in prose, is miserably incompetent to sit in judgment upon poetry, and under the proud name too of the British Critic. By the same decider was the author of these poems accused of rendering several of her passages nonsense by the use of the word thrill: The following were some of the lines instanced. Speaking of Roubilliac's glorious monument in Wrexham Church, she says, “The sainted maid, amid the bursting tomb, “Hears the last trumpet thrill its silent gloom.” And also, “Marks the soft tear from thrill'd remembrance sprung.” Also, “What strains Eolian thrill the dusk expanse.” This critic must be poorly read in Milton, Pope, and Gray, and indeed, in all our best poets, since in them he might repeatedly find the word thrill used in the same sense. Johnson thus defines it as a verb active, “to thrill, to pass with a shuddering sensation.” Our hearts, or our memory may certainly be thrilled either by pleasure, pain, surprise, or terror, and so, in the language of poetry, may the tomb, the air, and other things, which are literally inanimate.—Milton says, in his hymn on the nativity, “Nature, that heard such sound “Beneath the hollow round “Of Cynthia's seat the airy region thrilling.” And Addison, “Ran thro' each nerve, and thrill'd in every vein.” And Prior, “His killing pleasure, his extatic smart, “And heavenly poison thrilling thro' thy heart.” But of similar use of the word thrill, the instances are endless. Polwhele, whose genius, in the colours clear Of poesy and philosophic art, Traces the sweetest impulse of the heart, Scorn, for thy Muse, the envy-sharpen'd spear, In darkness thrown, when shielded by desert She seeks the lyric fane. To virtue dear Thy verse esteeming, feeling minds impart Their vital smile, their consecrating tear. Fancy and judgment view with gracious eyes Its kindred tints, that paint the silent power Of local objects, deeds of high emprize To prompt; while their delightful spells restore The precious vanish'd days of former joys, By Love, or Fame, enwreath'd with many a flower. THE FIRST PSALM PUT INTO VERSE. Blest is the man, who ne'er hath stay'd Where sinners idly meet, Nor in their dangerous mazes stray'd, Nor press'd the scorner's seat! But still the Lord's eternal law Proves his uncloy'd delight, To ponder it with sacred awe Each passing day and night. Like the fair tree, beside the stream, Whose roots the waters lave; While ripening in the summer beam, Its fruits luxuriant wave. No blight shall on his leaf descend, For still hath Heav'n decreed, That full prosperity attend His every thought and deed. But for the unrepenting race, Not such their transient day, They are like chaff, which wild winds chase, Scatter'd from earth away. Therefore the wicked shall not stand In Judgment's dread abode, Nor sinners 'midst the righteous band That meet before their God. For He discerns the pure of heart, But, at the impious hurl'd, Eternal Vengeance speeds the dart, Which strikes them from the world. 137th PSALM PARAPHRASED. By clear Euphrates' palmy tide Near Babylon's high towers, Remembering Sion, oft we sigh'd And wept her vanquish'd powers. Our silent harps on trees we hung That wav'd along its shores; Then our proud foes required the song Of Sion's hallow'd bowers. How shall we sing the sacred strains, O Solyma! that flow'd, And taught thy echoing rocks and plains The mercies of our God! If thee, Jerusalem, my heart E'er ceases to regret, Let my right hand its tuneful art, And all its skill forget! If I forget thee, let my tongue, Parch'd to my palate cleave! Yes, if to thee, amid the song, My sighs forbear to heave. Remember Edom's sons, O Lord! In Sion's fatal day, Howling aloud their fell award Amid th' unequal fray! When red with Idumean gore Fair Olivet was found, These fanes, they cried, shall rise no more, Down with them to the ground! Daughter of Babylon, thy doom, From God's avenging hand, In retribution dread shall come, And desolate the land. And blest the man, whom Heav'n ordains To 'whelm thy boasted towers, And dash thy infants on the plains, As thou did'st slaughter ours! TO CHARLES SIMPSON, Esq. BARRISTER; WITH THOS.

Rival of Johnson's tomes Lives of the Poets. in every glow That Talent sheds, or Judgment can bestow; Guiltless of all which stains their specious page, Envy's fell blight, and Party's stormy rage, More learn'd It is well known that, with the exception of Chaucer, Johnson knew little of our early obsolete poetry. Mr T. Warton, in this his ingenious and learned work, shews us the prima stamina of an infinite number of those poctic flowers which adorn the juvenilia of Milton's muse. The style of Mr T. Warton's notes is eloquent in the first degree. We often find passages whose oratoric force and beauty equal the finest sentences of Dr Johnson. to trace, more generous to admire, This pours on Genius Taste's enlightning fire.

TO MAJOR ROOKE of MANSFIELD, ON THE PUBLICATION OF HIS DIURNAL REGISTER OF THE WINDS FOR THE TWO LAST YEARS. OCTOBER, 1796. No gale unlucky may thy fortunes find, Benign historian of the wayward wind! But, when it rises with proverbial sway, O! may it cast all fickleness away On grateful wings, from blight, and tempest free, Blow only good, from every point, to thee! TO CH. CLARKE, Esq. ON HIS REQUEST TO OBTAIN THE AUTHOR'S SIGNATURE WRITTEN WITH HER OWN HAND. (IMPROMPTU.) Our self-inscrib'd name, as the scroll were a treasure, When strangers request, in their fanciful pleasure, It flatters the hope that our bark may be scudding From this corporal climate of beef and of pudding, To the high shrine of Fame, where posterity know men, And we deem such request a right prosperous omen. But gales inauspicious oft blow from that region, And for one who attains it they blow back a legion; Then in spite of Clark's wish, and his brother's kind record, A Tour through England and Wales was published in 1793, by Edward Clark, Esq. brother to the gentleman whom the above Impromptu addresses. Mr E. Clarh's volume is adorned with aquatinta drawings. Lichfield is described there, and very flattering mention made of the Author of this Miscellany. Whose rays from that shrine my pale streamers have checker'd, Its winds will too probably soon blow from leeward, And sink in oblivion's cold waves Anna Seward. A WARNING EXHORTATION. Celia, I read thy melting eye; Thy check'd, yet stealing sighs I hear; See from thy cheek the roses fly, Or doubly glow when Florio's near. Ah! not from his seducing glance Too rashly drink the nectar'd bane! Avoid him in the graceful dance, Nor listen to his warbled strain! It helps not, it avails not there, Thy beauty's rising power to charm; That his stung senses own thee fair Is but thy too triumphant harm. Ne'er to the sacred, marriage shrine Thee shall the haughty Florio lead; O lost, if still that heart of thine, On latent, hopeless wishes feed! Long shall thy love-lit eyes be dim If soon thou art not bravely free; The dart will not be barb'd for him, Which surely shall be barb'd for thee. Amid the busy scenes of life Proud Florio shall thy image lose, Forgotten in Ambition's strife, Eclipsed by Grandeur's dazzling views; While thou, supine, in lonely shades, Shalt pale and sullen willows weave, Swelling the list of hapless maids, Who sigh disdain'd, neglected grieve. O then, in time, from future woes A shield in resolution seek, And twine no more the thorny rose 'Mid chains thy juster pride should break! Now, while thou may'st, the bliss dissolve, That lightens but with transient ray! Since clouds are gathering, to involve This shining, faithless, April day. TO HUMPHRY REPTON, Esq. ON BEING PRESENTED BY HIM WITH HIS LANDSCAPE OF STOWE-VALLEY. Mr Repton took the view from the drawing-room window, in the Bishop's Palace at Lichfield, the home of the author from her earliest youth. Ingenious Repton, from thy pencil warm, Shines this loved scene, with more than scenic charm; Since each soft feature, by th' associate powers, Of youth and love and friendship's blissful hours, Brings back, thro' every season, as it veers, Some striking image of the vanish'd years; Whether the months of bloom, and light, and love, With silver blossoms curtain yonder grove; With golden king-cups bid the mead be gay, And all the lake in molten glass inlay; Or when less genial mornings of the spring, Chill'd by retreating Winter's icy wing, The darkling waters with their gusts assail, And curl the mists along the rainy vale. Dear is that vale, when Summer's sultry days In one white, dazzling, circumabient blaze, Shadeless, excessive, all distionctness hide, Straining the visual rays, that scarce divide The circling hills, blue lake, and mossy tower, The hedge-row motionless, the silent bower; While shrink mute lirds, where central branches spread, And lowing mothers hang the heavy head, Wade in the sedgy brook that sluggish flows, Or crowd beneath the alder's dusky boughs. Dear, when the amber noon of autumn gilds The flame-tipt umbrage, and the level fields; Dear, e'en tho' sullen wintry clouds impend, And showers of leaves, in eddying winds, descend; While the mild auburn nymph, that crowns the year, Mourns her swoln waters, and her forests sear; To Fancy's eye her exile seems to wail, And, down the little, desolated vale, To press, with lingering step, as one that grieves, Its white, shrunk petals, and its rustling leaves. When o'er the livid lake, and grey waste fields His blasting rod the stormy despot wields; And thro' the rifled grove, in wild career, Howls the loud knell of the expiring year, Yet loved the scene:—And now, when tempests roar, Thick snows descend, and ice incrusts the shore, On its changed face no more my eye shall dwell, No fruitless sighs 'gainst Nature's laws rebel; But be it mine the glowing hearth to pile, And woo the mild Penates' The Penates, or Lares, are the household gods. There is a beautiful hymn to them in Mr Southey's Miscellany. lively smile! Thus, while ascending fires, with influence bright, Deride the sickly sun and howling night, In as disarming power thy tints shall foil The year's grim tyrant, yelling o'er his spoil, Charm'd, since the consecrated vale I see In one eternal Summer cloth'd by thee. PHILIPPIC ON A MODERN EPIC. Base is the purport of this epic song, Baneful its powers;—but O! the poesy! (What can it less when sun-born Genius sings?) Wraps in reluctant ecstacy the soul Where poesy is felt;—tho' here it paint In all the lurid traits of Nero's heart, The high heroic spirit of that prince Who graced the crown he wore; Britannia's boast, Harry of Monmouth!—he, who ne'er exposed His ardent legions on the deathful plain Where flamed not his broad shield, nor his white plumes, It is mentioned by the historians, that in the field of Agincourt, the white plumes of the king's helmet were always seen waving in the front of the battle. Play'd in the battle's van.—What claim'd he then From France, at the sword's point, but ceded rights Howe'er perfidiously with-held, when pledg'd For aye to England, after the proud day Of Cressy's thundering field? Cannon were first used by the English at the battle of Cressy. Then Gallia's star Sunk, and the planet of the argent shores Rose glittering on the zenith's azure height, What time upon the broken spears of France, And prostrate helms, immortal Glory stood, And with the lilies of that vaunting clime, Like a gay bridegroom, wreath'd the victor brows Of her great Edward.—O! unnatural boy! O beardless parricide! thy treacherous Muse, In the dire splendour of Medusa's charms Balefully deck'd, an impious task essays, Lab'ring to turn to deadliest aconite The laurel wreaths of Agincourt;—to brand The hallow'd lustre of the British name With slavish meanness, with rapacious avarice, And the wolf's rage. Britain, whose martial fire Applauding ages have pronounced adorn'd With fair munificence, and temper'd still By God-like mercy's sway,—O, dark of heart, As luminous of fancy! quit, for shame, Quit each insidious pretence to virtue, To Christian faith, and pity!—Dry thy tears For age-pass'd woes, they are the crocodile's, And o'er the murder of the royal victims, And o'er the Christian faith's apostacy, Witness'd in France, cry, “Vive la Liberte!” Dip thy young hands in her o'er-flowing chalice, Brimm'd with the gore of age, infants, and beauty, And, throwing thy red cap aloft in air, Laugh with the fierce hyena! Cooler reflection, and a long experience of the mischiefs resulting from the sanguinary system which this government has unwarned pursued through the last 14 years, have justified this Poet's representation of Henry the Fisth's conduct in invading France, and convinced me that the deprecation in Joan of Arc of monarchical ambition and rapacity, under that proud and specious term Military Glory, proceeded from benevolence to the Human race, and from a spirit of justice too firm to be warped by the vanity of national enthusiasm.—Anna Seward, Sept, 1807. LLANGOLLEN VALE, INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY ELEANOR BUTLER, AND MISS PONSONBY. Luxuriant Vale, thy country's early boast, What time great Glendour gave thy scenes to Fame; Taught the proud numbers of the English host, How vain their vaunted force, when Freedom's flame Fir'd him to brave the myriads he abhorr'd, Wing'd his unerring shaft, and edg'd his victor sword. Here first those orbs unclosing drank the light, Cambria's bright stars, the meteors of her foes; What dread and dubious omens According to the records of Lewis Owen, the year 1349 was distinguished by the first appearance of the pestilence in Wales, and by the birth of Owen Glendour. Hollingshed relates the marvellous tale of his father's horses, being found that night in their stables, standing up to the middle in blo d. The Bard, Iolo Goch, mentions a comet, which marked the great deeds of Glendour, when he was in the meridian of his glory.—See Mr Pennant's Tour. mark'd the night, That lour'd ere yet his natal morn arose! The steeds paternal, on their cavern'd floor, Foaming, and horror-struck, “fret fetlock-deep in gore.” Plague, in her livid hand, o'er all the isle, Shook her dark flag, impure with fetid stains; While “Death, on his pale horse,” Isaiah. with baleful smile, Smote with its blasting hoof the frighted plains. Soon thro' the grass-grown streets, in silence led, Slow moves the midnight cart, heapt with the naked dead. Yet in the festal dawn of Richard's reign, Richard the Second. Thy gallant Glendour's sunny prime arose; Virtuous, tho' gay, in that Circean fane, Bright Science twin'd her circlet round his brows; Nor could the youthful, rash, luxurious king Dissolve the hero's worth on his Icarian wing. Sudden it drops on its meridian flight!— Ah! hapless Richard! never didst thou aim To crush primeval Britons with thy might, And their brave Glendour's tears embalm thy name. Back from thy victor-rival's vaunting throng, Sorrowing, and stern, he sinks Llangollen's shades among. Soon in imperious Henry's Henry the Fourth. dazzled eyes, The guardian bounds of just dominion melt; His scarce-hoped crown imperfect bliss supplies, Till Cambria's vassalage be deeply felt. Now up her craggy steeps, in long array, Swarm his exulting bands, impatient for the fray. Lo! thro' the gloomy night, with angry blaze, Trails the fierce comet, and alarms the stars; Each waning orb withdraws its glancing rays, Save the red planet, that delights in wars. Then, with broad eyes upturn'd, and starting hair, Gaze the astonish'd crowd upon its vengeful glare. Gleams the wan morn, and thro' Llangollen's Vale Sees the proud armies streaming o'er her meads. Her frighted echos warning sounds assail, Loud, in the rattling cars, the neighing steeds; The doubling drums, the trumpet's piercing breath, And all the ensigns dread of havoc, wounds, and death. High on a hill as shrinking Cambria stood, And watch'd the onset of th'unequal fray, She saw her Deva, stain'd with warrior-blood, Lave the pale rocks, and wind its fateful way Thro' meads, and glens, and wild woods, echoing far The din of clashing arms, and furious shout of war. From rock to rock, with loud acclaim, she sprung, While from her Chief the routed legions fled; Saw Deva roll their slaughter'd heaps among, The check'd waves eddying round the ghastly dead; Saw, in that hour, her own Llangollen claim Thermopylæ's bright wreath, and aye-enduring fame. Thus, consecrate to glory.—Then arose A milder lustre in its blooming maze; Thro' the green glens, where lucid Deva flows, Rapt Cambria listens with enthusiast gaze, While more enchanting sounds her ear assail, Than thrill'd on Sorga's bank, the love-devoted Vale.

'Mid the gay towers on steep Din's Brinna's cone, In 1390, Castel Dinas-Brân, now a bare ruin, was inhabited by the lovely Lady Mifanwy Vechan, of the house of Tudor Trevor. She was beloved by the Bard Hoel. See Mr Pennant's Tour, adorned by a pleasing translation in English verse, of one of Hoel's poems in her praise, and complaining of her coldness. The ruins of Castel Dinas-Brân, are on a conoid mountain of laborious access. It rises in the midst of Llangollen Valley. Her Hoel's breast the fair Mifanwy fires.— O! Harp of Cambria, never hast thou known Notes more mellifluent floating o'er the wires, Than when thy Bard this brighter Laura sung, And with his ill-starr'd love Llangollen's echoes rung. Tho' Genius, Love, and Truth inspire the strains, Thro' Hoel's veins tho' blood illustrious flows, Hard as th' Eglwyseg rocks Rocks of the Eagles. They are opposite Castel Dinas-Brân. The Rev. Mr Roberts of Dinbren asserts, that the word Eglwyseg, has that interpretation. Mr Pennant derives it from the name of a gentleman, to whose memory the neighbouring column was erected; though, in another part of his Tour, he mentions Leland's testimony, that a pair of eagles built annually in the Eglwyseg rocks, and that a person was let down in a basket to take the young, with another basket over his head, to protect him from the fury of the parent-birds. This tradition favours Mr Roberts' etymology. That Gentleman has lately added largely to his paternal house, situated on a noble mountain in Llangollen Valley. The house stands near its craggy summit, and looks as if it had been scooped out of the rocks. A very narrow valley, containing two sloping copses, and a few bright little fields, with a woody lane winding between them, divides Mr Roberts' mountain from the opposite elevation of Castel Dinas-Brân. The south-east front of the house looks immediately into this narrow valley; the barren, and very singular Eglwyseg rocks on the left, and Castel Dinas-Brân in front. Between the base of the latter, and the sloping foot of his own mountain, Mr R. has the bird's-eye prospect of Llangollen Town, and a part of the Vale.—The author of this Poem, is indebted to the friendly hospitality of Mr and Mrs Roberts, for an opportunity of contemplating the beauties of their own scene, and of the celebrated Valley of Llangollen. her heart remains, Her smile a sun-beam playing on their snows; And nought avails the Poet's warbled claim, But, by his well-sung woes, to purchase deathless fame. Thus consecrate to Love, in ages flown,— Long ages fled Din's-Brinna's ruins show, Bleak as they stand upon their steepy cone, The crown and contrast of the Vale below, That, screen'd by mural rocks, with pride displays Beauty's romantic pomp in every sylvan maze. Now with a vestal lustre glows the Vale, Thine, sacred Friendship, permanent as pure; In vain the stern authorities assail, In vain persuasion spreads her silken lure, High-born, and high-endow'd, the peerless twain, Right Honourable Lady Eleanor Butler, and Miss Ponsonby, now seventeen years resident in Llangollen Vale, and whose guest the author had the honour to be during several delightful days of Summer. Pant for coy Nature's charms 'mid silent dale, and plain. Thro' Eleanora, and her Zara's mind, Early tho'genius, taste, and fancy flow'd, Tho' all the graceful arts their powers combin'd, And her last polish brilliant life bestow'd, The lavish promiser, in youth's soft morn, Pride, pomp, and love, her friends, the sweet enthusiasts scorn. Then rose the fairy palace of the Vale, Then bloom'd around it the Arcadian bowers; Screen'd from the storms of Winter, cold and pale, Screen'd from the fervours of the sultry hours, Circling the lawny crescent, soon they rose, To letter'd ease devote, and Friendship's blest repose. Smiling they rose beneath the plastic hand Of energy, and taste;—nor only they, Obedient Science hears the mild command, Brings every gift that speeds the tardy day, Whate'er the pencil sheds in vivid hues, Th' historic tome reveals, or sings the raptured Muse. How sweet to enter, at the twilight grey, The dear, minute Lyceum The Library, fitted up in the Gothic taste, the painted windows of that form. In the elliptic arch of the door, there is a prismatic lantern of variously tinted glass, containing two large lamps with their reflectors. The light they shed resembles that of a volcano, gloomily glaring. Opposite, on the chimney-piece, a couple of small lamps, in marble reservoirs, assist the prismatic lantern to supply the place of candles, by a light more consonant to the style of the apartment, the pictures it contains of absent friends, and to its aërial music. of the dome, When, thro' the colour'd crystal, glares the ray, Sanguine and solemn 'mid the gathering gloom, While glow-worm lamps diffuse a pale, green light, Such as in mossy lanes illume the starless night. Then the coy scene, by deep'ning veils o'erdrawn, In shadowy elegance seems lovelier still; Tall shrubs, that skirt the semi-lunar lawn, Dark woods, that curtain the opposing hill; While o'er their brows the bare cliff faintly gleams, And, from its paly edge, the evening-diamond Evening star. streams. What strains Æolian thrill the dusk expanse, As rising gales with gentle murmurs play, Wake the loud chords, or every sense intrance, While in subsiding winds, they sink away! Like distant choirs, “when pealing organs blow,” And melting voices blend, majestically slow. “But ah! what hand can touch the strings so fine, “Who up the lofty diapason roll “Such sweet, such sad, such solemn airs divine, “Then let them down again into the soul!” These lines with inverted commas, are from Thomson's Castle of Indolence. The prouder sex as soon, with virtue calm, Might win from this bright pair pure Friendship's spotless palm. What boasts tradition, what th' historic theme, Stands it in all their chronicles confest Where the soul's glory shines with clearer beam, Than in our sea-zon'd bulwark of the west, When, in this Cambrian Valley, Virtue shows Where, in her own soft sex, its steadiest lustre glows? Say, ivied Valle Crucis, The picturesque ruins of Valle Crucis Abbey, one of the most striking objects in this Valley. They are particularly described by Mr Pennant, and there are engravings of them in his Tour. time-decay'd, Dim on the brink of Deva's wandering floods, Your riv'd arch glimmering thro' the tangled glade, Your grey hills towering o'er your night of woods, Deep in the Vale's recesses as you stand, And, desolately great, the rising sigh command, Say, lonely, ruin'd pile, when former years Saw your pale train at midnight altars bow; Saw Superstition frown upon the tears That mourn'd the rash irrevocable vow, Wore one young lip gay Eleanora's smile? Did Zara's look serene one tedious hour beguile? For your sad sons, nor Science wak'd her powers; Nor e'er did Art her lively spells display; But the grim idol Superstition. vainly lash'd the hours That dragg'd the mute, and melancholy day; Dropt her dark cowl on each devoted head, That o'er the breathing corse a pall eternal spread. This gentle pair no glooms of thought infest, Nor Bigotry, nor Envy's sullen gleam Shed withering influence on the effort blest, Which most should win the other's dear esteem, By added knowledge, by endowment high, By Charity's warm boon, and Pity's soothing sigh. Then how should Summer-day or Winter-night, Seem long to them who thus can wing their hours! O! ne'er may pain, or sorrow's cruel blight, Breathe the dark mildew thro' these lovely bowers, But lengthen'd life subside in soft decay, Illumed by rising Hope, and Faith's pervading ray. May one kind ice-bolt, from the mortal stores, Arrest each vital current as it flows, That no sad course of desolated hours Here vainly nurse the unsubsiding woes! While all who honour Virtue, gently mourn Llangollen's vanish'd Pair, and wreath their sacred urn. VERSES ON WREXHAM, AND THE INHABITANTS OF ITS ENVIRONS. Proud of her ancient race, Britannia shows Where, in her Wales, another Eden glows, And all her sons, to truth, and honour dear, Prove they deserve the paradise they share. Thrice happy Wrexham, 'mid thy neighbouring groves Stray, with 'twin'd arms, the Virtues, and the Loves, There Fletcher, Mrs Fletcher of Gwernheyled—Gwernheyled, means Sunny Alders. from her own Gwernheyled, beams, Fair as its meads, and liberal as its streams; The Sister Apperlys, The two Miss Apperlys. in youth's soft morn, With rising charms the festal scenes adorn; And friendly Price, Mrs Parry Price, late of that neighbourhood. as happy, free, and gay, As when, in life and beauty's rosy May, She shone, the Hebe of her green retreat, With half the youth of Cambria at her feet. See Cunliffe's eyes The Lady of Sir Foster Cunliffe, Baronet. diffuse the gladdening ray, And shed around her Pleasure's golden day; Meridian loveliness, majestic grace, Stream o'er her form, and lighten in her face; While Sense and Virtue's blended influence dart The look, the voice, resistless to the heart. Nor only, Wrexham, do thy circling groves Boast the fair virtues, and the radiant loves, There Hayman's song, Watkin Hayman, Esq. with its enchanting powers, Floats thro' thy vales, thy mansions, and thy bowers; Her hallow'd temple there Religion shows, That erst with beauteous majesty arose In ancient days, when Gothic art display'd Her fanes, in airy elegance array'd, Whose nameless charms the Dorian claims efface, Corinthian splendour and Ionic grace; Then plied, with curious skill, now rarely shown, Th' adorning chissel, o'er the yielding stone. But as those Graces which alone delight With their fine forms the captivated sight, Must not aspire to emulate the art That, while it charms the eye, pervades the heart, See Gothic elegance the palm resigns, When Art in intellectual greatness shines.

A POEM, WRITTEN ON THAT COAST, AND ADDRESSED TO ITS PROPRIETOR. SIR JOHN STANLEY. Thee, Stanley, thee, our gladden'd spirit hails, Since life's first good for us thy efforts gain, Who, habitants of Albion's inland vales, Reside far distant from her circling main. These lightsome walls, beneath thy generous cares Arose, the lawny scene's convivial boast, While at thy voice clear-cheek'd Hygeia rears Her aqueous altars on this tepid coast. This coast, the nearest to our central home, That green Britannia's watry zone displays, Now gives the drooping frame a cheerful dome, The large and handsome Hotel, built in the year 1792, by Sir John Stanley, and which converts these pleasant Downs into a commodious sea-bathing place. Whose Lares smile, and promise lengthen'd days. When gather'd fogs the pale horizon steep, Falling in heavy, deep, continual rain, If, ere the sun sink shrouded in the deep, His crystal rays pervade the vapoury train, Dry are the turfy downs, diffusive spread O'er the light surface of the sandy mound, Where e'en the languid form may safely tread, Drink the pure gale, and eye the blue profound. Dear scene!—that stretch'd between the silver arms Of Deva, Deva, the classical name of the Dee. “Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream.” Milton's Lycidas. Also Prior, in Henry and Emma. “Him, great in peace and wealth, fair Deva knows.” Milton probably uses the epithet wizard, in allusion to the rites and mysteries performed on the banks of the Deva, or Dee. In Spencer, the river is made the haunt of magicians. That fine poetic scholar and critic, the late Mr T. Warton, observes, in his Edition of Milton's lesser Poems, that Merlin used to visit old Timon in a green valley, at the foot of the mountain, Rauran-Vaur, in Merionethshire, from which mountain the river Deva springs. See Fairy Queen, B.1.C.ix.V.4. In Drayton, an old poet, with whose works Milton was familiar, it is styled “the hallowed, the holy, the ominous flood.” and of Mersey, meets the main, And when the sun-gilt day illumes its charms, Boasts of peculiar grace, nor boasts in vain. Tho' near the beach, dark Helbrie's lonely isle, Reposes sullen in the watry way, Hears round her rocks the tides, returning, boil, And o'er her dusky sandals dash their spray. Mark, to the left, romantic Cambria's coast, Her curtain'd mountains rising o'er the floods; While seas on Orm's beak'd promontory burst, Blue Deva swells her mirror to the woods. High o'er that varied ridge of Alpine forms, Vast Moel-y-Fammau The first word spoken as one syllable, as if spelt Mole. The name signifies in Welch, Mother of Mountains. It is seen in the Hoyle-Lake prospect, behind the Flintshire Hills, and considerably higher than any of them. towers upon the sight, Lifts her maternal bosom to the storms, And screens her filial mountains from their blight. Far on the right, the dim Lancastrian plains, In pallid distance, glimmer thro' the sky, Tho', hid by jutting rocks, thy splendid fanes, Commercial Liverpool, elude the eye. Wide in the front the confluent oceans roll, Amid whose restless billows guardian Hoyle, To screen her azure Lake when tempests howl, Spreads the firm texture of her amber Isle. The Sand Island, six miles long, and four broad, which lying in the sea, a mile from shore, forms the Lake; and breaking the force of the tides, constitutes the safety of that Lake as an harbour and bathing-place. And tho' the surging tide's resistless waves Roll, day, and night, its level surface o'er, Tho' the skies darken, and the whirlwind raves, They froth,—but rush innoxious to the shore. When fear-struck seamen, 'mid the raging flood, Hear thundering Shipwreck yell her dire decrees, See her pale arm rend every sail, and shroud, And o'er the high mast lift her whelming seas, If to thy quiet harbour, gentle Hoyle, The shatter'd navy thro' the tempest flies, Each joyous mariner forgets his toil, And carols to the vainly angry skies. What tho' they vex the Lake's cerulean stream, And curl its billows on the shelly floor, Yet, in despite of Fancy's timid dream, Age, and infirmity, may plunge secure. How gay the scene when Spring's fair mornings break, Or Summer-noons illume the grassy mound, When anchor'd navies crowd the peopled Lake, Or deck the distant ocean's skiey bound! Like leafless forests, on its verge extreme Rise the tall masts;—or spreading wide their sails, Silvering, and shining in the solar beam, Stand on that last blue line, and court the gales. The peopled Lake, of song, and lively cheer, And boatswain's whistle bears the jovial sound; While rosy pennants, floating on the air, Tinge the soft seas of glass, that sleep around. 'Twas on these Downs King William encamped his army on the Hoyle Lake Downs, before he took shipping from thence, on his victorious expedition to Ireland. the Belgian hero spread His ardent legions in auspicious hours, Ere to Ierne's hostile shores he led To deathless glory their embattled powers. When, like the conqueror of the Eastern World, That stemm'd with dauntless breast the Granic flood, His victor-sword immortal William whirl'd, And Boyne's pale waters dyed with rebel blood. Since now, to health devoted, this calm shore Breathes renovation in its foamy wave, For the kind Donor shall each heart implore, The good his energies to others gave. That long on him clear-cheek'd Hygeia's smile, And long on all he loves, serene may shine, Who from thy sparkling coast, benignant Hoyle, Diffused the blessings of her crystal shrine. HERVA, AT THE TOMB OF ARGANTYR. A RUNIC DIALOGUE. Herva. Argantyr, wake!—to thee I call, Hear from thy dark sepulchral hall! 'Mid the forest's inmost gloom, Thy daughter, circling thrice thy tomb, With mystic rites of thrilling power Disturbs thee at this midnight hour! I, thy Sauferlama's child, Of my filial right beguil'd, Now adjure thee to resign The charmed Sword by birth-right mine! When the Dwarf, on Eyvor's plain, Dim glided by thy marriage-train, In jewel'd belt of gorgeous pride, To thy pale and trembling bride, Gave he not, in whisper deep, That dread companion of thy sleep?— Fall'n before its edge thy foes, Idly does it now repose In the dark tomb with thee?—awake! Spells thy sullen slumber break! Now their stern command fulfill!— Warrior, art thou silent still?— Or are my gross senses found Deaf to the low sepulchral sound?— Hervardor,—Hiarvardor,—hear! Hrani, mid thy slumber drear! Spirits of a dauntless race, In armour clad, your tombs I trace. Now, with sharp and blood-stain'd spear, Accent shrill, and spell severe, I wake you all from slumber mute, Beneath the dark oak's twisted root!— Are Andgrym's hated sons no more That sleeps the Sword, that drank their gore?— Living,—why, to Magic Rhyme, Speaks no voice of former time, Low as o'er your tombs I bend To hear th' expected sounds ascend, Murmuring from your darksome hall, At a virgin's solemn call?— Hervardor,—Hiarvardor,—hear! Hrani,—mark my spell severe! Henceforth may the semblance cold, That did each warrior's spirit hold, Parch, as corse unblest, that lies Withering in the sultry skies!— Ghastly may your forms decay, Hence the noisome reptile's prey, If ye force not, thus adjur'd, My Sire to yield the charmed Sword! Argantyr. Arm'd amid this starless gloom, Thou, whose steps adventurous roam; Thou, that wav'st a magic spear Thrice before our mansions drear, Devoted virgin,—know in time The mischiefs of the Runic Rhyme, Forcing accents, mutter'd deep, From the cold reluctant lip! Me no tender father laid Entomb'd beneath an hallow'd shade; It was no friendly voice that gave The oak, that screen'd a warrior's grave, Gave it, in malignant tone, To the blasting thunderstone.— Timeless now these bones decay, Pervious to the baleful ray Of the swart star.—'Mid battle's yell The charm'd, the fatal weapon fell From my unwary grasp.—A knight Seiz'd the Sword of magic might. Virgin, of thy spells demand His name,—and from his victor hand, Try if thy intrepid zeal May win the all-subduing Steel. Herva. Warrior, thus, with falsehood wild, Seek'st thou to deceive thy child?— Sure as Odin doom'd thy fall, And hides thee in this silent hall, Here sleeps the Sword.—Pale Chief, resign That, which is by birthright mine! Fear'st thou, spirit of my sire, At thy only child's desire, Glorious heritage to yield, Conquest in the deathful field? Argantyr. Daring Herva, listen yet, Spare thy heart its long regret! Why trembling shrunk thy mother's frame When the Fatal Present came? Virgin, mark the boding word, Sullen whisper'd o'er the Sword! It prophesied Argantyr's foes Should rue its prowess;—yet that woes Greater far his Race should feel, Victims of the Cruel Steel, When, in blood of millions dyed, It arms an ireful fratricide. Maid, no erring accents warn;— Of sons to thee, hereafter born, One thy Chiefs shall Hydreck name, Dark spirited!—but dear to fame Shall blooming Hiaralmo live.— Maid, his doom thy mandates give! Renounce, renounce the dire demand, Or to thy sons, in Hydreck's hand, Fatal proves, some future day, The Charmed Sword.—Disturb it not!—away! Herva. Argantyr,—hear thy daughter's voice, Spells decree an only choice! Or, in perturbed tomb unblest, The silence of sepulchral rest Shall no more thy sunk eye steep, Close no more thy pallid lip, Or, ere this night's shadows melt, Mine the Sword, and gorgeous belt. Argantyr. Young maid,—who as of warrior might, Roamest thus to tombs by night, In coat of mail, with voice austere, Waving the corse-awakening Spear O'er thy dead ancestors;—offence, And danger threaten!—hie thee hence! Herva. Obey, obey, or sleep no more! Now my sacred right restore! The Sword, that joys when foes assail, Sword, that scorns the ribbed mail, Scorns the car, in swift career, Scorns the helmet, scorns the spear; Scorns the nerv'd experienc'd arm; Argantyr, yield it to my charm! 'Tis not well the victor's pride, With thee in silent tombs to hide; Thy child, thy only child, demands,— Reach it with thy wither'd hands! Argantyr. The death of Hiaralmo lies Beneath this mouldering arm!—and rise Round its edge, the lurid fires, Hostile to unaw'd desires. Hie thee hence, nor madly dare The death-denouncing grasp;—beware! Herva. Not if thousand fires invade Streaming from its angry blade. Innoxious are the fires that play Round the corse, with meteor ray, And in these waste hours of night Silent death-halls dimly light; Yet, gliding with consuming force, Undaunted would I meet their course. Argantyr. Thou, whose awless voice proclaims Scorn of the sepulchral flames, Lest their force around thee swell, Punishing thy daring spell, And thy mortal form consume, Herva, see!—thy father's tomb Opens!—mark, to thee restored, Rising slow, the baneful Sword!— See, it meets thy rash desire Bickering with funereal fire! Herva. Warrior, now dost thou reclaim The lustre of thy former fame; Lo, the Sword, a seeming brand, Blazes in thy daughter's hand! Nor perishes that hand beneath Vapourous flames, that round it wreathe, Gleam along the midnight air, Illume the forest wide,—and glare On the scath'd Oak!—Sepulchral wood, Thee I quit for fields of blood! Nor would I, on its fateful range, This Sword, with all its meteors, change For the Norweyan sceptre.—Lo, Death, and conquest, wait me now!— Argantyr. Hiaralmo's future bane, Grasp'd with exultation vain, Fatal, fatal shall be found To thee, and thine, in cureless wound! By that wound 'tis now decreed Hydrek's self at length shall bleed! Herva, less thy long regret Had thy chiefs in combat met Andgrym's sons, with warlike zeal, Met them in uncharmed steel. Herva. Sleep, Argantyr,—Chief of might, Thro' the long, the dreary night; Nor let strife, and bitter scorn, 'Mid Herva's offspring, yet unborn, Disturb thee in the tomb!—and mark, The Spear, that broke thy slumber dark, Round the blasted oak I wave, That ill protects a warrior's grave! Soon shall its scath'd trunk be seen Cloth'd in shielding bark, and green As before the vengeful time, When, by force of baleful Rhyme, It shrunk amid the forest's groan, Smote by the red thunder-stone. Thro' the renovated boughs, Guardians of thy deep repose, Shall the hail no longer pour, The livid dog-star look no more! Spirits of the elder dead, Spell-awak'd from slumber dread, Not to your spears, in martial pride, Resting by each hero's side, Not to your gore-spotted mail, Steely shroud of warrior pale, Shall, thro' thousand winters, drain Driving snow, or drenching rain; Nor, while countless summers beam On arid plain, or shrinking stream, Thro' the widening chink be known Reptile vile of sultry noon, To wind the slimy track abhorr'd!— Fate is mine, since mine the Sword! Argantyr. Herva, thine the source of woes, Direful long to all thy foes, Ere against thy peace it turn, And thou thy bleeding race shalt mourn. When extinct the tomb's blue fires, Whose light now gleams, and now retires, Quivering o'er its edge, forbear To touch the Venom'd Blade;—beware! Venom, for the blood prepar'd Of twelve brave chiefs, their dread reward. Herva, now thy father's tomb Slowly closes!—Ne'er presume Again to breathe, in Odin's hall, Shrill the corse-disturbing call! Herva. I go,—for these blue fires infest The troubled tomb's presumptuous guest; As of step profane aware, Round me, more and more they glare.— Hervardor, Hiarvardor,—keep Lasting slumber!—Hrani sleep! And sleep Argantyr!—Chiefs of might, Quiet be your mornless night! INSCRIPTIONS. EACH WRITTEN ON A CARD INCLOSED IN A LETTER-CASE, NETTED BY THE AUTHOR, AND PRESENTED TO HER FRIENDS. TO MRS WINGFIELD OF SHREWSBURY. OCTOBER 1794. Since each soft virtue of domestic life, Of tender parent, and of faithful wife, Kind sister, duteous daughter, friend sincere, Found in thy bosom a congenial sphere, Whence all their purest emanations flow'd, With pity melted, with affection glow'd, So may each paper, which shall slumber here, Thro' many a vexing, many a waning year, Speak of thy weal, and speak of their's whose doom Thy future days must darken, or illume. TO MISS WINGFIELD OF SHREWSBURY. Since deceased. OCTOBER 1794. Oft, when thy hands shall slip this rosy string, Her may its nets to thy remembrance bring, Who, as she wove them, still invok'd for thee A fate from care, regret, and anguish free; Each night, that health and peace may seal thine eyes, Each morning prove a harbinger of joys, That life, which must pass on, may glide, the while, Mild as thy glance and cheering as thy smile! TO MISS CATHERINE WINGFIELD. OCTOBER 1794. O may this silken prison long contain Love's tender vows, and Friendship's cordial strain! Yet ne'er for thee, may sorrow's darken'd hours Require, lov'd maid, their sympathetic powers; Still may indulgent Heaven, with guardian care, Ordain thee happy, as it form'd thee fair! TO MISS REMMINGTON, OF LICHFIELD. Since Mrs Thos. White. JANUARY 1795. Ne'er, sweet Maria, may this net enfold The lines of faithless love, or friend grown cold, But those blest Talismans, whose spells can smooth Life's thorny path, and all its sorrows sooth! Yet may thy ruling star so kindly glow That few the thorns, and vanishing the woe! TO MISS FERN OF LICHFIELD. APRIL 1795. If e'er, Eliza, grief awakes thy sigh, Pales that red lip, or dims that lucid eye, O may this gay envelop then contain, From hands belov'd, the lenitives of pain; Yet seldom may thy fair and prosperous fate Demand the pensive sympathetic trait, But Friendship, tender, fervent, and sincere, Breathe the glad strains of gratulation here! TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY ELEANOR BUTLER, WITH THE SAME PRESENT. Thou, who with firm, free step, as life arose, Led thy loved friend where sacred Deva flows, On Wisdom's cloudless sun with thee to gaze, And build your eyrie on that rocky maze; Ah, Eleanora! wilt thou gently deign To bid these nets the tribute lines contain, When Virtue, Genius, Rank, and Wealth, combine, To pay ow'd homage at so pure a shrine? And O! when kindling with the lovely theme, The blest reality of Hope's fond dream, Friendship, that bliss unshar'd disdains to know, Nor sees, nor feels one unpartaken woe; When for such worth, in each exalted mind, Resolv'd as man, and more than woman kind, Their warm admirers ask a length of years, Unchill'd by terror, and unstain'd by tears, Then may the fervent benedictions lie! And long, long hence meet Eleanora's eye, While with her Zara's it shall frequent rove The treasur'd records of esteem, and love! TO MISS PONSONBY.

INSCRIPTIONS, SEALED UP AND INCLOSED IN NET LETTER-CASES, PRESENTED TO THE CHARITABLE REPOSITORY AT LICHFIELD. TO THE YOUNG MARRIED LADY WHO HUMANELY PURCHASES THIS TRIFLE. SEPTEMBER 1800. If, gentle Lady, thou hast paid Thy faithful vows at Hymen's shrine, Oft in these silken folds be laid Each tender animated line, Which absent Love sincerely pours As business urges forc'd delay; Kind sun-beams of the winter'd hours, When thy dear Lord is far away. And, gentle Lady, round thy knees Do blooming infants gaily sport, With duteous smiles essay to please, With lifted eyes thy favour court? O! may their virtues noon-tide rays, That now, in Life's fresh morning dawn, Illuminate thy waning days, When Time's dim veils are o'er thee drawn! TO THE YOUNG UNMARRIED LADY, WHO PURCHASES ME. SEPTEMBER 1800. Sweet maid, is thy soft, snowy hand Unplighted yet, and gaily free? O may thy graces soon command A power, that shall resemble me! Since me a silken cage thou'lt find For all thy future swains fond letters, And may thy charms his wishes bind In as indissoluble fetters! And when, enamour'd, he shall yield All power his freedom to regain, With sense, and smiles, and virtue, gild His viewless, but eternal chain! LYDIA LETTER-CASE. TO THE LADY, WHETHER SINGLE OR MARRIED, WHO SHALL CHARITABLY PURCHASE THIS TRIFLE. SEPTEMBER 1800. If, Lady, thou art fair, take heed, I pray, That more than charms exterior round thee play! Each sun, that looks on Beauty, wastes her power, E'en as it feeds, and fades, the summer flower; Then O! collect, against such failing sway, Charms of the mind, that fear no pale decay; And, as the holly's cluster'd berries rise Bright in the year's dim wane, and icy skies, So may those charms, when fled thy youthful prime, Glow with gay strength amid the snows of time! TO THE LADY WHO MAY PURCHASE THIS ENVELOPE, AND WHO MAY NOT BE A CELEBRATED BEAUTY. SEPTEMBER 1800. In courts and balls each undistinguish'd face, Boasting nor Hebe's bloom, nor Helen's grace, To no more purpose of delight is there, Than to enhance the triumphs of the fair; Obscured, near Beauty's shining forms to stray, As moon and stars around the sun by day; Or by that homage find their pride sustain'd Which their eclipsing rivals had disdain'd; The wretched gleanings, with tired hand, to rake, And insincere attention give and take. But O! if thine the Mind's true charms appear, To dazzling Beauty leave her proper sphere; Unenvying leave her to her transient sway, The speedy darkning of her solar ray! Thou, in thy milder orb—of private life, As duteous Daughter, and endearing Wife, Kind Sister, gentle Mistress, faithful Friend, Shalt find with Life alone thy empire end! TO THE DOWAGER LADY BLAKISTON, WITH A LETTER-CASE. Conscious that she, whose hand these nets enwove, Honour'd the virtuous man, Colonel Cane, Lady Blakiston's second husband, a gentleman of distinguished excellence of heart and urbanity of manners. who once was thine, Permit the precious scriptures of his love Here in their folds to find a faithful shrine! O! to the treasur'd sorrows of thy breast May future years no sad accession bring, But comfort, peace, and resignation blest, Fall on thy heart from Time's unpausing wing, Till late it shall present the final day, From mortal bonds that sets thee ever free, And calls to his thy willing soul away, Who once an Eden made this earth to thee. TO MRS SIDDONS. Siddons, when first commenc'd thy ardent course, The powers that guard the Drama's aweful shrine, Beauty, and grandeur, tenderness, and force, Silence that speaks, and eloquence divine, For thee erected that approachless throne None may or hope to conquer, or to share, And all our subject passions trembling own Each various sense subdued and captive there: Yet the heart says, respect a rival claim, A claim that rises in unvanquish'd strife; Behold, dividing still the palm of Fame, Her radiant Science, and her spotless Life! ODE ON ENGLAND'S NAVAL TRIUMPHS IN THE PRESENT WAR. This Ode was written on receiving intelligence of Admiral Nelson's victory on the Nile. Sublime to all the rising winds Britannia's ensigns gaily stream; From Howe's bright day proud Gallia finds Her naval strength a vanish'd dream; “That Britain rules the subject waves, “And vows her sons shall ne'er be slaves. When Jervis, on the Atlantic deep, Intrepid crush'd Iberia's sails, He taught St Vincent's rocky steep, Her torrid hills, and sultry vales, “That great Britannia rul'd the waves, “And vow'd her sons should ne'er be slaves. And when illustrious Duncan stood To France and Holland's blended train, In tyrant and apostate blood Afresh he stampt the patriot strain, “Rule Britannia, rule the waves, “Britons never shall be slaves. But hark! from Afric's glowing shores What sounds exulting Glory brings! How loud Britannia's Lion roars, How high her Genius soars—and sings “Rule Britannia, &amp;c. The motley flag of France no more Shall vaunting greet her bloody coast, Before resistless Nelson's power It sunk!—appall'd!—o'erwhelm'd!—and lost! “Rule Britannia, &amp;c. Invaded Egypt, at the sight, Her grateful shores illumin'd wide; Old Nile records that wondrous night, Resounding o'er his purpled tide, “Rule Britannia, &amp;c. Ye partners of that matchless hour, Return, to future ages famed; Return the charter'd song to pour When Nelson and the Nile are named, “Rule Britannia, rule the waves, “Britons never shall be slaves. [After the preceding stanzas were written and sung at a music meeting at Birmingham, Admiral Warren's speedily-succeeding Victory was announced.] The flag of triumph yet again Floats from the temple's gilded height! Gay fires ascend!—the patriot strain Redoubled rends the vault of night! “Rule Britannia, rule the waves, “Britons never shall be slaves! On green Ierne's menaced strand Rebellion, darkly cowering, stood, And heard the charter'd song expand 'Mid skies of flame, o'er seas of blood, “Rule Britannia, &amp;c. Saw fell Invasion's routed horde, Victorious Warren, strike to thee, Loud as thy cannon's thunder pour'd, And hail'd redeem'd Ierne free, Whose sons, while Britain rules the waves, To haughty France shall ne'er be slaves. O Source of Mercies! to thy name Shall Praise her grateful notes prolong, That thus ascends, in high acclaim, Thy favour'd nation's hallow'd song, “Rule Britannia, rule the waves, “Britons never shall be slaves.” TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE MARCHIONESS OF DONEGALL, WITH MR HAYLEY'S LIFE OF MILTON. Go, rescuing Volume, seek her gentle hands Whose heart o'er every noble deed expands! To such thy page inevitably dear, Where Truth, resistless as Ithuriel's spear, From party-prejudice, Alluding to Dr Johnson's unjust biography of Milton. malignant spleen, And literary envy draws the screen, Whose sophist reasoning, and detractive powers, Satanic influence breath'd in Eden's bowers; Yet with some merits, pious, liberal, kind, Held union strange in Johnson's mighty mind. Lo! all is day in this redeeming tome! Again in light the amaranth garlands bloom; And, as unveil'd appears each dark'ning aim, Great in the lustre of his former fame, Immortal Milton stands to future times, Nor sighing Goodness mourns his fancied crimes. These leaves while graceful Donegall explores, New pleasures shall augment her bosom's stores; Increase the happiness, that hourly swells Where the soul's sunshine, conscious Virtue, dwells. And O! what virtue more unclouded beams Than from her spotless life continual streams? Virtue, that 'mid distinction's dazzling rays, And in the tempting and the dangerous days Of blooming charms, and inexperienc'd youth, Shone the bright pattern of connubial truth; With growing lustre and with strength'ning powers From life's gay morning to its noontide hours. What then was innocence and faith sincere, The blush of modesty and pity's tear, Now glows with energies, that widely spread Comfort on penury's deserted head, And guards that Worth, which rank and wealth behold Change all their tinsel to Intrinsic Gold. TO MISS GODFREY, Sister to the Marchioness of Donegall. WITH MR HAYLEY'S LIFE OF MILTON. Here, from that excellence of mind and heart Which seated Milton high in Honour's fane, From genius, piety, and lyric art, Recedes injustice' dark but transient stain. Thou, gentle Maid, whose kindred spirit shares Each virtue thy fair sister's life displays, Wilt joy to see expos'd the sophist snares That wilder judgment in their artful maze. And O! to each more bright these leaves will shine, Their truth, their eloquence, more welcome prove, Viewing the Bard, whose songs ye feel divine, Given back to Glory by the Friend ye love. SONNET I. I have slightly altered this Sonnet since the Collection was last published.—Anna Seward. When life's realities the soul perceives Vain, dull, perchance corrosive, if she glow With rising energy, and open throw The golden gates of Genius, she achieves His fairy clime delighted, and receives In those gay paths, where thornless roses blow, Full compensation.—Lo, with alter'd brow Lours the false world, and the fine spirit grieves! No more young Hope tints with her light and bloom The darkening scene.—Then to ourselves we say, Come, bright Imagination, come! relume Thy orient lamp; with recompensing ray Shine on the mind, and pierce its gathering gloom With all the fires of intellectual day! SONNET II. The future, and its gifts alone we prize, Few joys the present brings, and those alloy'd; Th' expected fulness leaves an aching void; But Hope stands by, and lifts her sunny eyes That gild the days to come.—She still relies The phantom Happiness not thus shall glide Always from life.—Alas!—yet ill betide Austere Experience, when she coldly tries In distant roses to discern the thorn! Ah! is it wise to anticipate our pain? Arriv'd, it then is soon enough to mourn. Nor call the dear consoler false and vain, When yet again, shining through April-tears, Those fair enlight'ning eyes beam on advancing years. SONNET III. WRITTEN AT BUXTON IN A RAINY SEASON. From these wild heights, where oft the mists descend In rains, that shroud the sun, and chill the gale, Each transient, gleaming interval we hail, And rove the naked vallies, and extend Our gaze around, where yon vast mountains blend With billowy clouds, that o'er their summits sail; Pondering, how little Nature's charms befriend The barren scene, monotonous, and pale. Yet solemn when the darkening shadows fleet Successive o'er the wide and silent hills, Gilded by watry sun-beams, then we meet Peculiar pomp of vision. Fancy thrills, And owns there is no scene so rude and bare, But Nature sheds or grace or grandeur there. SONNET IV. TO HONORA SNEYD, Afterwards Mrs Edgeworth. WHOSE HEALTH WAS ALWAYS BEST IN WINTER. MAY 1770. And now the youthful, gay, capricious Spring, Piercing her showery clouds with crystal light, And with their hues reflected streaking bright Her radiant bow, bids all her warblers sing; The lark, shrill carolling on soaring wing; The lonely thrush, in brake, with blossoms white, That tunes his pipe so loud; while, from the sight Coy bending their dropt heads, young cowslips fling Rich perfume o'er the fields.—It is the prime Of hours that beauty robes:—yet all they gild, Cheer and delight in this their fragrant time, For thy dear sake, to me less pleasure yield Than, veil'd in sleet, and rain, and hoary rime, Dim Winter's naked hedge and plashy field. SONNET V. TO A FRIEND, WHO THINKS SENSIBILITY A MISFORTUNE. Ah, thankless! canst thou envy him who gains The Stoic's cold and indurate repose? Thou! with thy lively sense of bliss and woes!— From a false balance of life's joys and pains Thou deem'st him happy.—Plac'd mid fair domains, Where full the river down the valley flows, As wisely might'st thou wish thy home had rose On the parch'd surface of unwater'd plains, For that, when long the heavy rain descends, Bursts over guardian banks their whelming tide!— Seldom the wild and wasteful flood extends, But, spreading plenty, verdure, beauty wide, The cool translucent stream perpetual bends, And laughs the vale as the bright waters glide. SONNET VI. WRITTEN AT LICHFIELD, IN AN EASTERN APARTMENT OF THE BISHOP'S PALACE, WHICH COMMANDS A VIEW OF STOW VALLEY. In this chill morning of a wintry Spring I look into the gloom'd and rainy vale; The sullen clouds, the stormy winds assail, Lour on the fields, and with impetuous wing Disturb the lake:—but Love and Memory cling To their known scene, in this cold influence pale; Yet priz'd, as when it bloom'd in Summer's gale, Ting'd by his setting sun.—When sorrows fling, Or slow disease, thus o'er some beauteous form Their shadowy languors, form, devoutly dear As thine to me, Honora, with more warm And anxious gaze the eyes of love sincere Bend on the charms, dim in their tintless snow, Than when with health's vermilion hues they glow. SONNET VII. By Derwent's rapid stream as oft I stray'd, With Infancy's light step and glances wild, And saw vast rocks, on steepy mountains pil'd, Frown o'er th' umbrageous glen; or pleased survey'd The cloudy moonshine in the shadowy glade, Romantic Nature to th' enthusiast child Grew dearer far than when serene she smil'd, In uncontrasted loveliness array'd. But O! in every scene, with sacred sway, Her graces fire me; from the bloom that spreads Resplendent in the lucid morn of May, To the green light the little glow-worm sheds On mossy banks, when midnight glooms prevail, And softest silence broods o'er all the dale. SONNET VIII. TRANSLATION. Short is the time the oldest being lives, Nor has longevity one hour to waste; Life's duties are proportion'd to the haste With which it fleets away;—each day receives Its task, that if neglected, surely gives The morrow double toil.—Ye, who have pass'd In idle sport the days that fled so fast, Days, that nor Grief recalls, nor Care retrieves, At length be wise, and think, that of the part Remaining in that vital period given, How short the date, and at the prospect start, Ere to the extremest verge your steps be driven! Nor let a moment unimprov'd depart, But view it as the latest trust of Heaven! SONNET IX. Seek not, my Lesbia, the sequester'd dale, Or bear thou to its shades a tranquil heart; Since rankles most in Solitude the smart Of injur'd charms and talents, when they fail To meet their due regard;—nor ev'n prevail Where most they wish to please:—Yet, since thy part Is large in life's chief blessings, why desert Sullen the world?—Alas! how many wail Dire loss of the best comforts Heaven can grant! While they the bitter tear in secret pour, Smote by the death of friends, disease, or want, Slight wrongs if thy self-valuing soul deplore, Thou but resemblest, in thy lonely haunt, Narcissus pining on the watry shore. SONNET X. TO HONORA SNEYD. APRIL 1773. Honora, should that cruel time arrive When 'gainst my truth thou should'st my errors poize, Scorning remembrance of our vanish'd joys; When for the love-warm looks, in which I live, But cold respect must greet me, that shall give No tender glance, no kind regretful sighs; When thou shalt pass me with averted eyes, Feigning thou see'st me not, to sting, and grieve, And sicken my sad heart, I could not bear Such dire eclipse of thy soul-cheering rays; I could not learn my struggling heart to tear From thy loved form, that thro' my memory strays; Nor in the pale horizon of despair Endure the wintry and the darken'd days. SONNET XI. How sweet to rove, from summer sun-beams veil'd, In gloomy dingles; or to trace the tide Of wandering brooks, their pebbly beds that chide; To feel the west-wind cool refreshment yield, That comes soft creeping o'er the flowery field, And shadow'd waters; in whose bushy side The mountain-bees their fragrant treasure hide Murmuring; and sings the lonely thrush conceal'd: Then, Ceremony, in thy gilded halls, When forced and frivolous the themes arise, With bow and smile unmeaning, O! how palls At thee, and thine, my sense!—how oft it sighs For leisure, wood-lanes, dells, and water-falls; And feels th' untemper'd heat of sultry skies! SONNET XII. JULY 1773. Chill'd by unkind Honora's alter'd eye, “Why droops my heart with pining woe forlorn,” Thankless for much of good?—what thousands, born To ceaseless toil beneath this wintry sky, Or to brave deathful oceans surging high, Or fell Disease's fever'd rage to mourn, How blest to them would seem my destiny! How dear the comforts my rash sorrows scorn!— Affection is repaid by causeless hate! A plighted love is changed to cold disdain! Yet suffer not thy wrongs to shroud thy fate, But turn, my soul, to blessings which remain; And let this truth the wise resolve create, The Heart estranged no anguish can regain. SONNET XIII. JULY 1773. Thou child of Night and Silence, balmy Sleep, Shed thy soft poppies on my aching brow! And charm to rest the thoughts of whence, or how Vanish'd that priz'd Affection, wont to keep Each grief of mine from rankling into woe. Then stern Misfortune from her bended bow Loos'd the dire strings;—and Care, and anxious Dread From my cheer'd heart, on sullen pinion fled. But now, the spell dissolv'd, th' enchantress gone, Ceaseless those cruel fiends infest my day, And sunny hours but light them to their prey. Then welcome midnight shades, when thy wish'd boon May in oblivious dews my eye-lids steep, Thou child of Night and Silence, balmy Sleep! SONNET XIV. JULY 1773. Ingratitude, how deadly is thy smart Proceeding from the form we fondly love! How light, compar'd, all other sorrows prove! Thou shed'st a Night of woe, from whence depart The gentle beams of patience, that the heart 'Mid lesser ills, illume.—Thy victims rove Unquiet as the ghost that haunts the grove Where Murder spilt the life-blood.—O! thy dart Kills more than life,—e'en all that makes life dear; Till we “the sensible of pain” would change For phrenzy, that defies the bitter tear; Or wish, in kindred callousness, to range Where moon-ey'd Idiocy, with fallen lip, Drags the loose knee, and intermitting step. SONNET XV. WRITTEN ON RISING GROUND NEAR LICHFIELD. MAY 1774. The evening shines in May's luxuriant pride, And all the sunny hills at distance glow, And all the brooks, that thro' the valley flow, Seem liquid gold.—O! had my fate denied Leisure, and power to taste the sweets that glide Thro' waken'd minds, as the blest seasons go On their still varying progress, for the woe My heart has felt, what balm had been supplied? But where great Nature smiles, as here she smiles, 'Mid verdant vales, and gently swelling hills, And glassy lakes, and mazy, murmuring rills, And narrow wood-wild lanes, her spell beguiles Th' impatient sighs of grief, and reconciles Poetic minds to life, with all her ills. SONNET XVI. TRANSLATED FROM BOILEAU. Apollo, at his crowded altars, tired Of votaries, who for trite ideas thrown Into loose verse, assume, in lofty tone, The Poet's name, untaught, and uninspir'd, Indignant struck the Lyre.—Straight it acquired New powers, and complicate. Then first was known The rigorous Sonnet, to be framed alone By duteous bards, or by just taste admir'd.— Go, energetic Sonnet, go, he cried, And be the test of skill!—For rhymes that flow Regardless of thy rules, their destin'd guide, Yet take thy name, ah! let the boasters know That with strict sway my jealous laws preside, While I no wreaths on rebel verse bestow. SONNET XVII. This, and the following Sonnet, have been slightly altered by their Author since the last edition. Ah! why have I indulged my dazzled sight With scenes in Hope's delusive mirror shewn? Scenes, that too seldom human life hath known In more than vision rise;—but O! how bright The Mind's soft sorceress pour'd her rosy light On every promis'd good;—oft on the boon Which might at Fame's resounding shrine be won, Then lanc'd its beams where all the Loves invite! Now, with stern hand, Fate draws the sable veil O'er the frail glass!—Hope, as she turns away, The darken'd crystal drops.—Heavy and pale, Rain-drizzling clouds quench all the darts of day: Low mourns the wind along the gloomy dale, And tolls the death-bell in the pausing gale. SONNET XVIII. AN EVENING IN NOVEMBER, WHICH HAD BEEN STORMY, GRADUALLY CLEARING UP, IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY. Ceas'd is the rain; but heavy drops yet fall From the drench'd roof;—yet murmurs the sunk wind Round the dim hills; can yet a passage find Whistling thro' yon cleft rock, and ruin'd wall. Loud roar the angry torrents, and appal Tho' distant.—A few stars, emerging kind, With green rays tremble thro' their misty shrouds: And the moon gleams between the sailing clouds On half the darken'd hill.—Now blasts remove The shadowing clouds, and on the mountain's brow, Full-orb'd she shines. Half sunk within its cove Heaves the lone boat, with gulphing sound:—and lo! Bright rolls the settling lake, and brimming rove The vale's blue rills, and glitter as they flow! SONNET XIX. TO ? Farewell, false Friend!—our scenes of kindness close! To cordial looks, to sunny smiles farewell! To sweet consolings, that can grief expel, And every joy soft sympathy bestows! For alter'd looks, where truth no longer glows, Thou hast prepared my heart;—and it was well To bid thy pen th' unlook'd-for story tell, Falsehood avow'd, that shame, nor sorrow knows. O! when we meet,—(to meet we're destin'd, try To avoid it as thou may'st) on either brow, Nor in the stealing consciousness of eye, Be seen the slightest trace of what, or how We once were to each other;—nor one sigh Flatter with weak regret a broken vow! SONNET XX. ON READING A DESCRIPTION OF POPE'S CARDENS AT TWICKENHAM. Ah! might I range each hallow'd bower and glade Musæus cultur'd, many a raptured sigh Would that dear, local consciousness supply Beneath his willow, in the grotto's shade, Whose roof his hand with ores and shells inlaid. How sweet to watch, with reverential eye, Thro' the sparr'd arch, the streams he oft survey'd, Thine, blue Thamésis, gently wandering by! This is the Poet's triumph, and it towers O'er Life's pale ills, his consciousness of powers That lift his memory from oblivion's gloom, Secure a train of these heart-thrilling hours By his idea deck'd in rapture's bloom, For spirits rightly touch'd thro' ages yet to come. SONNET XXI. Proud of our lyric galaxy, I hear Of faded Genius with supreme disdain; As when we see the miser bend insane O'er his full coffers, and in accents drear Deplore imagin'd want;—and thus appear To me those moody censors, who complain, As Shaftsbury plain'd Of the Poets, who were contemporary with Lord Shaftsbury, Dryden, Cowley, Pope, Prior, Congreve, Gay, Addison, &amp;c, in the period which this age styles Augustan, his lordship speaks with sovereign scorn. In his Characteristics he, without making any exception, labours to prove, that the compositions of Dryden are uniformly contemptible. See his advice to an author in the second volume of the Characteristics, and also his miscellaneous reflections, in the third volume; “If,” says he to the authors, “your “Poets are still to be Mr Bayeses, and your prose writers Sir “Rogeis, without offering at a better manner, must it follow “that the manner is good, and the wit genuine?” Thus it is that the jealousy people of literary fame often feel of each other, produces the foolish and impolitic desire of decrying the general pretensions of the Age to Genius.— Their narrow selfishness leads them to betray the common cause which is their true interest to support. They persuade the credulous many, with whom envy of superior talents increases their willingne sto despise, that imagination is become enervated; designing, however, to have it understood, that in their individual instance exists the sole exception, “For they would each bestride the narrow world “Like a Colossus.” in a now boasted reign, That “Poesy had left our darken'd sphere.” Whence may the present stupid dream be traced That now she shines not as in days foregone? Perchance neglected, often shine in waste Her Lights, from number into confluence run, More than when, thinly in th' horizon placed, Each orb shone separate, and appear'd a sun. SONNET XXII. SUBJECT CONTINUED. You, whose dull spirits feel not the fine glow Enthusiasm breathes, no more of light Perceive ye in rapt Poesy, tho' bright In Fancy's richest colouring, than can flow From jewel'd treasures in the central night Of their deep caves.—You have no sun to show Their inborn radiance pure.—Go, snarlers, go; Nor your defects of feeling, and of sight, To charge upon the Poet thus presume, Ye lightless minds, whate'er of title proud, Scholar, or Sage, or Critic, ye assume, Arraigning his high claims with censure loud, Or sickly scorn; yours, yours is all the cloud, Gems cannot sparkle in the midnight gloom. SONNET XXIII. TO MISS E.S. Do I not tell thee surly Winter's flown, That the brook's verge is green;—and bid thee hear, In yon irriguous vale, the blackbird clear, At measur'd intervals, with mellow tone, Choiring the hours of prime? “of prime.”—Milton's Par. Lost. and call thine ear To the gay viol dinning in the dale, With tabor loud, and bag-pipe's rustic drone To merry shearer's dance;—or jest retail From festal board, from choral roofs the song; And speak of Masque, or Pageant, to beguile The caustic memory of a cruel wrong?— Thy lips acknowledge this a generous wile, And bid me still the effort kind prolong; But ah! they wear a cold and joyless smile. SONNET XXIV. TRANSLATION. Behold the day an image of the year! The year an image of our life's short span! Morn, like the Spring, with growing light began, Spring, like our youth, with joy, and beauty fair; Noon picturing Summer;—Summer's ardent sphere Manhood's gay portrait.—Eve, like Autumn, wan, Autumn resembling faded age in man; Night, with its silence, and its darkness drear, Emblem of Winter's frore and gloomy reign, When torpid lie the vegetative powers; Winter, so shrunk, so cold, reminds us plain Of the mute grave, that o'er the dim corse lours; There shall the weary rest, nor aught remain To the pale slumberer of life's checker'd hours! SONNET XXV. PETRARCH to VAUCLUSE. This Sonnet is not a Translation or Paraphrase, but is written in the character of Petrarch, and in imitation of his manner. Fortunate Vale! exulting Hill! dear Plain! Where morn, and eve, my soul's fair ido! stray'd, While all your winds, that murmur'd thro' the glade, Stole her sweet breath; yet, yet your paths retain Prints of her step, by fount, whose floods remain In depth unfathom'd; 'mid the rocks, that shade, With cavern'd arch, their sleep.—Ye streams, that play'd Around her limbs in Summer's ardent reign, The soft resplendence of those azure eyes Tinged ye with living light.—The envied claim These blest distinctions give, my lyre, my sighs, My songs record; and, from their Poet's flame, Bid this wild vale, its rocks, and streams arise, Associates still of their bright Mistress' fame. SONNET XXVI. O Partial Memory! years, that fled too fast From thee, in more than pristine beauty rise, Forgotten all the transient tears and sighs Somewhat that dimm'd their brightness! Thou hast chas'd Each hovering mist from the soft suns, that grac'd Our fresh, gay morn of youth;—the heart's high prize, Friendship,—and all that charm'd us in the eyes Of yet unutter'd love.—So pleasures past, That in thy crystal prism thus glow sublime, Beam on the gloom'd and disappointed mind, When youth and health, in the chill'd grasp of Time, Shudder and fade;—and cypress buds we find Ordain'd life's blighted roses to supply, While but reflected shine the golden lights of joy. SONNET XXVII. See wither'd Winter, bending low his head; His ragged locks stiff with the hoary dew; His eyes, like frozen lakes, of livid hue; His train, a sable cloud, with murky red Streak'd.—Ah! behold his nitrous breathings shed Petrific death!—Lean, waleful birds pursue, On as he sweeps o'er the dun lonely moor, Amid the battling blast of all the winds, That, while their sleet the climbing sailor blinds, Lash the white surges to the sounding shore. So com'st thou, Winter, finally to doom The sinking year; and with thy ice-dropt sprays, Cypress and yew, engarland her pale tomb, Her vanish'd hopes, and aye-departed days. SONNET XXVIII. O, Genius! does thy sun-resembling beam To the internal eyes of man display In clearer prospect, the momentous way That leads to peace? Do they not rather seem Dazzled by lustres in continual stream, Till night they find in such excessive day? Art thou not prone, with too intense a ray, To gild the hope improbable, the dream Of fancied good?—or bid the sigh upbraid Imaginary evils, and involve All real sorrow in a darker shade? To fond credulity, to rash resolve Dost thou not prompt, till reason's sacred aid And fair discretion in thy fires dissolve? SONNET XXIX. SUBJECT CONTINUED. If Genius have its danger, grief, and pain, Which common sense escapes, yet who would change The powers, thro' Nature and thro' Art that range, To walk the bounded, dull, tho' safer plain Of moderate intellect, where only reign Some faint perception of the Sweet,—the Strange, The Gay,—the Grand,—the Tender,—the Sublime, And all the varied stores of Fancy's clime? Destructive shall we deem yon noon-tide blaze, If, transiently, the eye, o'erpower'd, resign Visual distinctness?—Shall we rather praise The moon's pale light?—With owlish choice incline That common sense her lunar lamp should raise, Than that the solar fires of Genius shine? SONNET XXX. That song again!—its sounds my bosom thrill, Breathe of past years, to all their joys allied; And, as the notes thro' my sooth'd spirits glide, Dear recollection's choicest sweets distil, Soft as the morn's calm dew on yonder hill, When slants the sun upon its grassy side, Tinging the brooks that many a mead divide With lines of gilded light; and blue, and still, The distant lake stands gleaming in the vale. Sing, yet once more, that well-remember'd strain, Which oft made vocal every passing gale In days long fled, in Pleasure's golden reign, The youth of changed Honora!—now it wears Her air—her smile—spells of the vanish'd years! SONNET XXXI. TO THE DEPARTING SPIRIT OF AN ALIENATED FRIEND. O, ever dear! thy precious, vital powers Sink rapidly!—the long and dreary night Brings scarce an hope that morn's returning light Shall dawn for thee!—In such terrific hours, When yearning fondness eagerly devours Each moment of protracted life, his flight The rashly-chosen of thy heart has ta'en Where dances, songs, and theatres invite. Expiring Sweetness! with indignant pain I see him in the scenes where laughing glide Pleasure's light forms;—see his eyes gaily glow, Regardless of thy life's fast ebbing tide; I hear him, who should droop in silent woe, Declaim on actors, and on taste decide! SONNET XXXII. SUBJECT OF THE PRECEDING SONNET CONTINUED. Behold him now his genuine colours wear, That specious false-one, by whose cruel wiles I lost thy amity; saw thy dear smiles Eclips'd; those smiles, that used my heart to cheer, Wak'd by thy grateful sense of many a year When rose thy youth, by Friendship's pleasing toils Cultured;—but Dying!—O! for ever fade The angry fires.—Each thought, that might upbraid Thy broken faith, which yet my soul deplores, Now as eternally is past and gone As are the interesting, the happy hours, Days, years, we shared together. They are flown! Yet long must I lament thy hapless doom, Thy lavish'd life and early-hasten'd tomb. SONNET XXXIII. JUNE 1780. Last night her form the hours of slumber bless'd Whose eyes illumin'd all my youthful years.— Spirit of dreams, at thy command appears Each airy shape, that visiting our rest, Dismays, perplexes, or delights the breast. My pensive heart this kind indulgence cheers; Bliss, in no waking moment now possess'd, Bliss, ask'd of thee with memory's thrilling tears. Nightly I cry,—how oft, alas! in vain,— Give, by thy powers, that airy shapes controul, Honora to my visions!—ah! ordain Her beauteous lip may wear the smile that stole, In years long fled, the sting from every pain! Show her sweet face, ah show it to my soul! SONNET XXXIV. JUNE 1780. When death, or adverse fortune's ruthless gale, Tears our best hopes away, the wounded heart Exhausted, leans on all that can impart The sympathetic charm; its mutual wail Sooths the sick soul. Ah! never can it fail To balm our bleeding grief's severest smart; Nor wholly vain feign'd Pity's solemn art, Tho' we should penetrate her sable veil. Concern, e'en known to be assum'd, our pains Respecting, kinder welcome far acquires Than cold neglect, or mirth that grief profanes. Thus each faint glow-worm of the night conspires, Gleaming along the moss'd and darken'd lanes, To cheer the gloom with her unreal fires. SONNET XXXV. SPRING. APRIL 29TH, 1782. In April's gilded morn when south winds blow, And gently shake the hawthorn's silver crown, Wafting its scent the forest-glade adown, The dewy shelter of the bounding doe, Then, under trees, soft tufts of primrose show Their palely-yellowing flowers;—to the moist sun Blue harebells peep, while cowslips stand unblown, Plighted to riper May;—and lavish flow The lark's loud carols in the wilds of air. O! not to Nature's glad enthusiast cling Avarice, and pride.—Thro' her now blooming sphere Charm'd as he roves, his thoughts enraptur'd spring To Him, who gives frail man's appointed time These cheering hours of promise and of prime. SONNET XXXVI. SUMMER. JUNE 27TH, 1782. Now on hills, rocks, and streams, and vales, and plains, Full looks the shining day.—Our gardens wear The gorgeous robes of the consummate year. With laugh, and shout, and song, stout maids and swains Heap high the fragrant hay, as thro' rough lanes Rings the yet empty waggon.—See in air The pendent cherries, red with tempting stains, Gleam thro' their boughs.—Summer, thy bright career Must slacken soon in Autumn's milder sway; Then thy now heapt and jocund meads shall stand Smooth,—vacant,—silent,—thro' th' exulting land As wave thy rival's golden fields, and gay Her reapers throng. She smiles, and binds the sheaves; Then bends her parting step o'er fall'n and rustling leaves. SONNET XXXVII. AUTUMN. OCTOBER 27TH. 1782. Thro' changing months a well-attemper'd mind Welcomes their gentle or terrific pace.— When o'er retreating Autumn's golden grace Tempestuous Winter spreads in every wind Naked asperity, our musings find Grandeur increasing, as the glooms efface Variety and glow.—Each solemn trace Exalts the thoughts, from sensual joys refin'd. Then blended in our rapt ideas rise The vanish'd charms, that summer-suns reveal, With all of desolation, that now lies Dreary before us;—teach the soul to feel Awe in the present, pleasure in the past, And to see vernal morns in Hope's perspective cast. SONNET XXXVIII. WINTER. DECEMBER 1ST, 1782. If he whose bosom with no transport swells In vernal airs and hours commits the crime Of sullenness to Nature, 'gainst the time, And its great Ruler, he alike rebels Who seriousness and pious dread repels, And awless gazes on the faded clime, Dim in the gloom, and pale in the hoar rime That o'er the bleak and dreary prospect steals.— Spring claims our tender, grateful, gay delight; Winter our sympathy and sacred fear; And sure the hearts that pay not pity's rite O'er wide calamity; that careless hear Creation's wail, neglect, amid her blight, The solemn Lesson of the Ruin'd Year. SONNET XXXIX. WINTER EVENING. DECEMBER 7TH, 1782. When mourn the dark winds o'er the lonely plain, And from pale noon sinks, ere the fifth cold hour, The transient light, imagination's power, With knowledge, and with science in her train, Not unpropitious Hyems' icy reign Perceives; since in the deep and silent hour High themes the rapt concent'ring thoughts explore, Freed from external Pleasure's glittering chain. Then most the understanding's culture pays Luxuriant harvest, nor shall Folly bring Her aids obtrusive.—Then, with ardent gaze, The Ingenious to their rich resources spring, While sullen Winter's dull imprisoning days Hang on the vacant mind with flagging wing. SONNET XL. DECEMBER MORNING. This Sonnet was written in an apartment of the west front of the Bishop's Palace at Lichfield, inhabited by the Author from her thirteenth year. It looks upon the Cathedral-Area, a green lawn encircled by prebendal houses, which are white from being rough-cast. DEC. 19TH, 1782. I love to rise ere gleams the tardy light, Winter's pale dawn;—and as warm fires illume, And cheerful tapers shine around the room, Thro' misty windows bend my musing sight Where, round the dusky lawn, the mansions white, With shutters clos'd, peer faintly thro' the gloom, That slow recedes; while yon grey spires assume, Rising from their dark pile, an added height By indistinctness given.—Then to decree The grateful thoughts to God, ere they unfold To Friendship, or the Muse, or seek with glee Wisdom's rich page:—O, hours! more worth than gold, By whose blest use we lengthen life, and free From drear decays of age, outlive the old! SONNET XLI. INVITATION TO A FRIEND. DEC. 21ST, 1782. Since dark December shrouds the transient day, And stormy winds are howling in their ire, Why com'st not Thou, who always can'st inspire The soul of cheerfulness, and best array A sullen hour in smiles?—O haste to pay The cordial visit sullen hours require!— Around the circling walls a glowing fire Shines;—but it vainly shines in this delay To blend thy spirit's warm Promethean light. Come then, at Science, and at Friendship's call, Their vow'd disciple;—come, for they invite! The social powers without thee languish all. Come, that I may not hear the winds of Night, Nor count the heavy eave-drops as they fall. SONNET XLII. DEC. 31ST, 1782. Lo! the Year's final Day!—Nature performs Its obsequies with darkness, wind and rain; But man is jocund.—Hark! th' exultant strain From towers and steeples drowns the wintry storms! No village spire but to the cots and farms, Right merrily, its scant and tuneless peal Rings round!—Ah! joy ungrateful!—mirth insane! Wherefore the senseless triumph, ye, who feel This annual portion of brief life the while Depart for ever?—Brought it no dear hours Of health and night-rest?—none that saw the smile On lips belov'd?—O! with as gentle powers Will the next pass?—Ye pause!—Yet careless hear Strike these last clocks, that knell th' expiring year! SONNET XLIII. TO MAY, IN THE YEAR 1783. My memory, long accustom'd to receive In deep-engraven lines, each varying trait Past times and seasons wore, can find no date Thro' many years, O! May, when thou hadst leave, As now, of the great Sun, serene to weave Thy fragrant chaplets; in poetic state To call the jocund Hours on thee to wait, Bringing each day, at morn, at noon, at eve, His mild illuminations.—Nymph, no more Is thine to mourn beneath the scanty shade Of half-blown leaves, and shivering to deplore Thy garlands immature, thy rites unpaid; Meads dropt with gold Dropt with gold—Kingcups. again to thee belong, Soft gales, luxuriant bowers, and wood land song. SONNET XLIV. Rapt Contemplation, bring thy waking dreams To this umbrageous vale at noon-tide hour, While ull of thee seems every bending flower, Whose petals tremble o'er the shadow'd streams Give thou Honora's image, when her beams, Youth, beauty, kindness, shone;—what time she wore That smile, of gentle, yet resistless power To sooth each painful passion's wild extremes. Here shall no empty, vain intruder chase, With idle converse, thy enchantment warm, That brings, in all its interest, all its grace, The dear, persuasive, visionary form. Can real life a rival blessing boast, When thou canst thus restore Honora early lost? SONNET XLV. This Sonnet was written when the balloon enthusiasm was at its height. From Possibility's dim chaos sprung, High o'er its gloom the Aërostatic power Arose!—Exulting nations hail'd the hour, Magnific boast of Science!—Loud they sung Her victory o'er the element, that hung, Pressing to earth the beings, who now soar Aerial heights;—but Wisdom bids explore This vaunted skill;—if, tides of air among, We know to steer our bark.—Here Science finds Her buoyant hopes burst, like the bubble vain, Type of this art;—guilty, if still she blinds The sense of fear; persists thy flame to fan, Sky-vaulting Pride, that to the aweless winds Throws, for an idle show, the Life of Man! SONNET XLVI. Dark as the silent stream beneath the night, Thy funeral glides to Life's eternal home, Child of its narrow house!—how late the bloom, The facile smile, the soft eye's crystal light, Each grace of youth's gay morn, that charms our sight, Play'd o'er that form!—now sunk in death's cold gloom, Insensate! ghastly!—for the yawning tomb, Alas! fit inmate.—Thus we mourn the blight Of virgin-beauty, and endowments rare In their glad hours of promise.—O! when age Drops, like the o'er-blown, faded rose, tho' dear Its long known worth, no stormy sorrows rage; But swell when we behold, unsoil'd by time. Youth's broken lily perished in its prime. SONNET XLVII. ON MR SARGENT'S DRAMATIC POEM, THE MINE. Petra, and Fossilia, are personifications of the first and last division of the fossil kingdom. The author of this beautiful Poem supposes the gnomes to be spirits of the, mine performing the behests of Petra and Fossilia, as the sylphs, gnomes, salamanders, &amp;c. appear as handmaids of the Nymph of Botany in that exquisite sport of imagination, the Botanic Garden. With lyre Orphean, see a bard explore The central caverns of the mornless night, Till now ne'er echoing to Æonian rite He comes!—and lo! upon the sparry floor, Advance to welcome him, each sister power, Petra, stern queen, Fossilia, cold and bright, And call their gnomes, to marshal in his sight The gelid incrust, and the veined ore, And flashing gem.—Then, while his songs pourtray The mystic virtues gold and gems acquire, With every charm that mineral scenes display, Th' imperial sisters praise the daring lyre, And grateful hail its new and powerful lay, That seats them high amid the Muses' choir. SONNET XLVIII. Now young-eyed Spring, on gentle breezes borne, 'Mid the deep woodlands, hills, and vales, and bowers, Unfolds her leaves, her blossoms, and her flowers Pouring their soft luxuriance on the morn. O! how unlike the wither'd, wan, forlorn, And limping Winter, that o'er russet moors, Grey, ridgy fields, and ice-incrusted shores, Strays!—and commands his rising winds to mourn, Protracted life, thou art ordain'd to wear A form like his; and, should thy gifts be mine, I tremble lest a kindred influence drear Steal on my mind;—but pious Hope benign, The soul's bright day-spring, shall avert the fear, And gild existence in her dim decline. SONNET XLIX. ON THE USE OF NEW AND OLD WORDS IN POETRY. While with false pride, and narrow jealousy, Numbers reject each new expression, won, Perchance, from language richer than our own, O! with glad welcome may the Poet see Extension's golden vantage! the decree Each way exclusive, scorn, and re-enthrone The obsolete, if strength, or grace of tone Or imagery await it, with a free, And liberal daring!—For the critic train, Whose eyes severe our verbal stores review, Let the firm bard require that they explain Their cause of censure; then in balance true Weigh it; but smile at the objections vain Of sickly spirits, hating for they do! The particle for is used in the same sense with because, by Shakespear, and Beaumont and Fletcher. “But she, and I, were creatures innocent, “Lov'd for we did. Bea. and Fle. Two Noble Kinsmen. “—Nor must you think “I will your serious and great business scant “For she is with me. —Othello. “They're jealous for they're jealous.” —Othello. SONNET L. In every breast affection fires, there dwells A secret consciousness to what degree They are themselves belov'd.—We hourly see Th' involuntary proof, that either quells, Or ought to quell false hopes,—or sets us free From pain'd distrust;—but, O, the misery! Weak self-delusion timidly repels The lights obtrusive—shrinks from all that tells Unwelcome truths, and vainly seeks repose For startled fondness, in the opiate balm Of kind profession, tho', perchance, it flows To hush complaint—O! in belief's clear calm, Or 'mid the lurid clouds of doubt, we find Love rise the sun, or comet of the mind. SONNET LI. TO SYLVIA, ON HER APPROACHING NUPTIALS. Hope comes to Youth, gliding thro' azure skies With amaranth crown:—her full robe, snowy white, Floats on the gale, and our exulting sight Marks it afar.—From waning life she flies, Wrapt in a mist, covering her starry eyes With her fair hand.—But now, in floods of light, She meets thee, Sylvia, and with glances, bright As lucid streams, when Spring's clear mornings rise. From Hymen's kindling torch, a yellow ray The shining texture of her spotless vest Gilds;—and the month that gives the early day The scent odorous, Milton, in the Par. Lost, gives the lengthened and harmonious accent to that word, rather than the short, and common one: —“the bright consummate flower “Spirit odorous breathes.” and the carol blest, Pride of the rising year, enamour'd May, Paints its redundant folds with florets gay. SONNET LII. Long has the pall of midnight quench'd the scene, And wrapt the hush'd horizon.—All around, In scatter'd huts, Labour, in sleep profound, Lies stretch'd, and rosy Innocence serene Slumbers;—but creeps, with pale and starting mien, Benighted Superstition.—Fancy-found, The late self-slaughter'd man, in earth yet green And festering, burst from his incumbent mound, Roams!—and the slave of terror thinks he hears A mutter'd groan!—sees the sunk eye, that glares As shoots the meteor.—But no more forlorn He strays;—the spectre sinks into his tomb! For now the jocund herald of the morn Claps his bold wings, and sounds along the gloom. “It fadeth at the crowing of the cock.” —Hamlet. SONNET LIII. WRITTEN IN THE SPRING 1785 ON THE DEATH OF THE POET LAUREAT. The knell of Whitehead tolls!—his cares are past, The hapless tribute of his purchased lays, His servile, his Egyptian tasks of praise!— If not sublime his strains, Fame justly placed Their power above their work.—Now, with wide gaze Of much indignant wonder, she surveys To the life-labouring oar assiduous haste A glowing bard, by every Muse embraced.— O, Warton! chosen Priest of Phœbus' choir! Shall thy rapt song be venal? hymn the Throne, Whether its edicts just applause inspire, Or Patriot Virtue view them with a frown? What needs for this the golden-stringed lyre, The snowy tunic, and the sun-bright zone Ensigns of Apollo's Priesthood. SONNET LIV. A PERSIAN KING TO HIS SON. FROM A PROSE TRANSLATION IN SIR WILLIAM JONES' ESSAY ON THE POETRY OF THE EASTERN NATIONS. Guard thou, my son, the helpless and the poor, Nor in the chains of thine own indolence Slumber enervate, while the joys of sense Engross thee, and thou say'st, “I ask no more.”— Wise men the shepherd's slumber will deplore When the rapacious wolf has leapt the fence, And ranges thro' the fold.—My son, dispense Those laws, that justice to the wrong'd restore.— The common-weal should be the first pursuit Of the crown'd warrior, for the royal brows The people first enwreath'd.—They are the root, The king the tree. Aloft he spreads his boughs Glorious; but learn, impetuous youth, at length, Trees from the root alone derive their strength. SONNET LV. ON THE QUICK TRANSITION FROM WINTER TO SUMMER, IN THE YEAR 1785. Loud blew the north thro' April's pallid days, Nor grass the field, nor leaves the grove obtains, Nor crystal sun-beams, nor the gilded rains, That bless the hours of promise, gently raise Warmth in the blood, without that fiery blaze, Which makes it boil along the throbbing veins.— Albion, displeased, her own loved Spring surveys Passing, with volant step, o'er russet plains; Sees her to Summer's fierce embraces speed, Pale, and unrobed,—Faithless! thou well may'st hide Close in his sultry breast thy recreant head, That did'st, neglecting thy distinguish'd isle, In Winter's icy arms so long abide, While Britain vainly languish'd for thy smile! SONNET LVI. TO A TIMID YOUNG LADY, DISTRESSED BY THE ATTENTIONS OF AN AMIABLE AND ACCEPTED LOVER. What bashful wildness in those crystal eyes, Fair Zillia!—Ah! more dear to Love the gaze That dwells upon its object, than the rays Of that vague glance, quick, as in summer skies The lightning's lambent flash, when neither rise Thunder, nor storm.—I mark, while transport plays Warm in thy lover's eye, what dread betrays Thy throbbing heart:—yet why from his soft sighs Fleet'st thou so swift away?—like the young hind, “Vitas hinnuleo me similis Chloe.” Horace. That bending stands the fountain's brim beside. When, with a sudden gust, the western wind Rustles among the boughs that shade the tide: See, from the stream, innoxious and benign, Starting she bounds, with terror vain as thine! SONNET LVII. WRITTEN THE NIGHT PRECEDING THE FUNERAL OF MRS CHARLES BUCKERIDGE. In Lichfield Cathedral the funeral rites are performed early in the morning. In the chill silence of the winter eve, Thro' Lichfield's darken'd streets I bend my way By that sad mansion, where Nerina's clay Awaits the Morning Knell;—and awed perceive, In the late bridal chamber, the clear ray Of numerous lights; while o'er the ceiling stray Shadows of those who frequent pass beneath Round the pale Dead.—What sounds my senses grieve! For now the busy hammer's stroke appals, That, “in dread note of preparation,” falls, Closing the sable lid!—With sighs I hear These solemn warnings from the house of woes; Pondering how late, for young Nerina, there, Joyous, the love-illumin'd morn arose. SONNET LVIII. Not the slow Hearse, where nod the sable plumes, The Parian statue, bending o'er the Urn, The dark robe floating, the dejection worn On the dropt eye, and lip no smile illumes; Not all this pomp of sorrow, that presumes It pays Affection's debt, is due concern To the for Ever Absent, tho' it mourn Fashion's allotted time. If Time consumes, While life is ours, the precious vestal-flame Memory should hourly feed;—if, thro' each day, She with whate'er we see, hear, think, or say, Blend not the image of the vanish'd frame, O! can the alien heart expect to prove, In worlds of light and life, a re-united love! SONNET LIX. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY MARIANNE CARNEGIE, Passing her winters at Ethic House on the Coast of Scotland, with her Father, Lord Northesk, who retired thither after the death of his excellent Countess. WRITTEN FEBRUARY 1787. Lady, each soft effusion of thy mind, Flowing thro' thy free pen, shows thee endued With taste so just for all of wise, and good, As bids me hope thy spirit does not find, Young as thou art, with solitude combined That wish of change, that irksome lassitude, Which often, thro' unvaried days, obtrude On youth's rash bosom, dangerously inclin'd To pant for more than peace.—Rich volumes yield Their soul-endowing wealth.—Beyond e'en these Shall consciousness of filial duty gild The gloomy hours, when Winter's turbid seas Roar round the rocks; when the dark tempest lours, And mourn the winds round Ethic's lonely towers. SONNET LX. The above Sonnet was addressed to a friend, who had fastidiously despised, because he did not think it exquisite sculpture, the statue of a water-nymph in Mr Knight's singular, and beautiful cold bath at Downton Castle near Ludlow. It rises amidst a rotunda, formed by rocks, and covered with shells and fossils, in the highest elevation of that mountainous and romantic scene. Why view'st thou, Edwy, with disdainful mien, The little Naiad of the Downton wave, High 'mid the rocks, where her clear waters lave The circling, gloomy basin?—In such scene, Silent, sequester'd, few demand, I ween, That last perfection Phidian chissels gave. Dimly the soft and musing form is seen In the hush'd shelly, shadowy, lone concave.— As sleeps her pure, tho' darkling fountain there I love to recollect her, stretch'd supine Upon its mossy brink, with pendent hair, As dripping o'er the flood.—Ah! well combine Such gentle graces, modest, pensive, fair, To aid the magic of her watry shrine. SONNET LXI. TO MR HENRY CARY, Then of Sutton Coldfield. ON READING HIS SONNETS WRITTEN AT SIXTEEN. Disciple of the bright Aonian Maid In thy life's blossom, a resistless spell Amid the wild wood, and irriguous dell, O'er thymy hill, and thro' illumined glade, Led thee, for her thy votive wreaths to braid, Where flaunts the musk-rose, and the azure bell Nods o'er loquacious brook, or silent well.— Thus woo'd her inspirations, their rapt aid Liberal she gave; nor only thro' thy strain Breath'd their pure spirit, while her charms beguiled The languid hours of sorrow, and of pain, But when youth's tide ran high, and tempting smiled Circean pleasure, rescuing did she stand, Broke the enchantress' cup, and snapt her wand. SONNET LXII. When this Sonnet was written, the subject of it had languished three years beneath repeated paralytic strokes, which had greatly enfeebled his limbs, and impaired his understanding. Contrary to all expectation he survived three more years, subject, through their progress, to the same frequent and dreadful attacks, though in their intervals he was apparntly free from pain or sickness. Dim grows the vital flame in his dear breast From whom my life I drew;—and thrice has Spring Bloom'd; and fierce Winter thrice, on darken'd wing, Howl'd o'er the gray, waste fields, since he possess'd Or strength of frame, or intellect.—Now bring Nor morn, nor eve, his cheerful steps, that press'd Thy pavement, Lichfield, in the spirit bless'd Of social gladness. They have failed, and cling Feebly to the fix'd chair, no more to rise Elastic!—Ah! my heart forebodes that soon The Full of Days shall sleep;—nor Spring's soft sighs, Nor Winter's blast awaken him!—Begun The twilight!—Night is long!—but o'er his eyes Life-weary slumbers weigh the pale lids down! SONNET LXIII. TO COLEBROOKE DALE. Thy Genius, Colebrooke, faithless to his charge, Amid thy woods and vales, thy rocks and streams, Form'd for the train that haunt poetic dreams, Naiads, and nymphs,—now hears the toiling barge And the swart Cyclops' ever-clanging forge Din in thy dells;—permits the dark-red gleams, From umber'd fires on all thy hills, the beams, Solar and pure, to shroud with columns large Of black sulphureous smoke, that spread their veils Like funeral crape upon the sylvan robe Of thy romantic rocks, pollute thy gales, And stain thy glassy floods;—while o'er the globe To spread thy stores metallic, this rude yell Drowns the wild woodland song, and breaks the poet's spell. SONNET LXIV. TO MR HENRY CARY, ON THE PUBLICATION OF HIS SONNETS. Prais'd be the Poet, who the Sonnet's claim, Severest of the orders that belong Distinct and separate to the Delphic song, Shall venerate, nor its appropriate name Lawless assume. Peculiar is its frame, From him derived, who shunn'd the city throng, And warbled sweet thy rocks and streams among, Lonely Valclusa!—and that heir of fame, Our greater Milton, hath, by many a lay Form'd on that arduous model, fully shown That English verse may happily display Those strict energic measures, which alone Deserve the name of Sonnet, and convey A grandeur, grace and spirit, all their own. SONNET LXV. TO THE SAME. Marcellus, since the ardours of my strain To thy young eyes and kindling fancy, gleam With somewhat of the vivid hues, that stream From Poesy's bright orb, each envious stain Shed by dull critics, venal, vex'd and vain, Seems recompens'd at full;—and so would seem Did not maturer sons of Phœbus deem My verse Aonian.—Thou, in time, shalt gain, Like them, amid the letter'd world, that sway, Which makes encomium fame;—so thou adorn, Extend, refine and dignify thy lay, And indolence, and syren pleasure scorn; Then, at high noon, thy Genius shall display The splendours promised in its shining morn. SONNET LXVI. Nobly to scorn thy gilded veil to wear, Soft Simulation!—wisely to abstain From fostering Envy's asps;—to dash the bane Far from our hearts, which Hate, with frown severe, Extends for those who wrong us;—to revere With soul, or grateful, or resign'd, the train Of mercies, and of trials, is to gain A quiet conscience, best of blessings here!— Calm conscience is a land-encircled bay, On whose smooth surface tempests never blow; Which shall the reflex of our life display Unstain'd by crime, tho' gloom'd with transient woe; While the bright hopes of Heaven's eternal day Upon the fair and silent waters glow. SONNET LXVII. ON DOCTOR JOHNSON'S UNJUST CRITICISMS IN HIS LIVES OF THE POETS. When Johnson's idolaters are hard pressed concerning his injustice in those fallacious though able pages;—when they are reminded that he there tells us the perusal of Milton's Paradise Lost is a task, and never a pleasure;—reminded also of his avowed contempt of that exquisite Poem, the Lycidas;— of his declaration that Dryden's absurd Ode on the death of Mrs Anne Killegrew, written in Cowley's worst manner, is the noblest Ode in this language;—of his disdain of Gray as a lyric poet; of the superior respect he pays to Yalden, Blackmore, and Pomfret;—When these things are urged, his adorers seek to acquit him of wilful misrepresentation by alledging that he wanted ear for lyric numbers, and taste for the higher graces of Poetry:—but it is impossible so to believe, when we recollect that even his prose abounds with poetic efflorescence, metaphoric conception, and harmonious cadence, which in the highest degree adorn it, without diminishing its strength. We must look for the source of his injustice in the envy of his temper. When Garrick was named a candidate for admission into the Literary Club, Dr Johnson told Mr Thrale he would black-ball him. “Who, Sir? Mr Garrick! Companion “of your youth! your acknowledged friend!”—“Why, “Sir, I love my little David better than any, or all of his flatterers “love him; but surely we ought to sit in a society like “ours, ‘unelbow'd by a Gamester, Pimp, or Player.” See Supplement to Dr Johnson's Letters, published by Mrs Piozzi. Could aweful Johnson want poetic ear, Fancy, or judgment?—no! his splendid strain, In prose, or rhyme, confutes that plea.—The pain Which writh'd o'er Garrick's fortunes, shows us clear Whence all his spleen to Genius.—Ill to bear A friend's renown, that to his own must reign, Compared, a meteor's evanescent train, To Jupiter's fix'd orb, proves that each sneer, Subtle and fatal to poetic sense, Did from insidious Envy meanly flow, Illumed with dazzling hues of eloquence, And sophist-wit, that labour to o'er-throw Th' awards of Ages, and new laws dispense That lift the Mean, and lay the Mighty low. SONNET LXVIII. ON THE POSTHUMOUS FAME OF DOCTOR JOHNSON. Well it becomes thee, Britain, to avow Johnson's high claims!—vet boasting that his fires Were of unclouded lustre, Truth retires Blushing, and Justice knits her solemn brow; The eyes of Gratitude withdraw the glow His moral strain inspired.—Their zeal requires That thou should'st better guard the sacred lyres, Sources of thy bright fame, than to bestow Perfection's wreath on him, whose ruthless hand, Goaded by jealous rage, the laurels tore, That Justice, Truth, and Gratitude demand Should deck those lyres till time shall be no more.— A radiant course did Johnson's glory run, But large the spots that darken'd on its sun. SONNET LXIX. TO A YOUNG LADY, PURPOSING TO MARRY A MAN OF IMMORAL CHARACTER IN THE HOPE OF HIS REFORMATION. Time, and thy charms, thou fanciest will redeem Yon aweless libertine from rooted vice. Misleading thought! has he not paid the price, His taste for virtue?—Ah, the sensual stream Has flow'd too long.—What charms can so entice, What frequent guilt so pall, as not to shame The rash belief, presumptuous and unwise, That crimes habitual will forsake the frame?— Thus, on the river's bank, in fabled lore, The rustic stands; sees the stream swiftly go, And thinks he soon shall find the gulph below A channel dry, which he may safe pass o'er.— Vain hope!—it flows—and flows—and yet will flow, Volume decreaseless, to the Final Hour. SONNET LXX. TO A YOUNG LADY IN AFFLICTION, WHO FANCIED SHE SHOULD NEVER MORE BE HAPPY. Yes, thou shalt smile again!—Time always heals In youth, the wounds of sorrow.—O! survey Yon now subsided deep, thro' night a prey To warring winds, and to their furious peals Surging tumultuous!—yet, as in dismay, The settling billows tremble.—Morning steals Grey on the rocks;—and soon, to pour the day From the streak'd east, the radiant orb unveils In all his pride of light.—Thus shall the glow Of beauty, health, and hope, by soft degrees Spread o'er thy breast; disperse these storms of woe; Wake, with sweet pleasure's sense, the wish to please, Till from those eyes the wonted lustres flow, Bright as the sun on calm'd and crystal seas. SONNET LXXI. TO THE POPPY. While Summer roses all their glory yield To crown the votary of love and joy, Misfortune's victim hails, with many a sigh, Thee, scarlet Poppy of the pathless field, Gaudy, yet wild and lone; no leaf to shield Thy flaccid vest, that as the gale blows high, Flaps, and alternate folds around thy head.— So stands in the long grass a love-craz'd maid, Smiling aghast; while stream to every wind Her garish ribbons, smear'd with dust and rain; But brain-sick visions cheat her tortured mind, And bring false peace. Thus, lulling grief and pain, Kind dreams oblivious from thy juice proceed, Thou flimsy, shewy, melancholy Weed. SONNET LXXII. WRITTEN IN THE RAINY SUMMER OF 1789. Ah, hapless June! circles yon lunar sphere Yet the dim Halo? whose cold powers ordain Long o'er these vales should sweep, in misty train, The pale continuous showers, that sullying smear Thy radiant lilies, towering on the plain; Bend low, with rivel'd leaves of canker'd stain, Thy drench'd and heavy rose.—Yet pledg'd and dear Fair Hope still holds the promise of the year; Suspends her anchor on the silver horn Of the next wexing orb, tho', June, thy day, Robb'd of its golden eve, and rosy morn, And gloomy as the Winter's rigid sway, Leads sunless, lingering, disappointing hours Thro' the song-silent glades and dropping bowers. SONNET LXXIII. TRANSLATION. He who a tender long-lov'd wife survives, Sees himself sunder'd from the only mind Whose hopes, and fears, and interests, were combin'd, And blended with his own.—No more she lives! No more, alas! her death-numb'd ear receives His thoughts, that trace the past, or anxious wind The future's darkling maze!—His wish refined, The wish to please, exists no more, that gives The will its energy, the nerves their tone!— He feels the texture of his quiet torn, And stopt the settled course that action drew; Life stands suspended—motionless—till thrown By outward causes, into channels new;— But, in the dread suspense, how sinks the soul forlorn! SONNET LXXIV. In sultry noon when youthful Milton lay, This romantic circumstance of our great Poet's juvenility was inserted, as a well known fact, in one of the General Evening Posts in the Spring 1789, and it was there supposed to have formed the first impulse of his Italian journey. Supinely stretch'd beneath the poplar shade, Lured by his form, a fair Italian maid Steals from her loitering chariot, to survey The slumbering charms, that all her soul betray. Then, as coy fears th' admiring gaze upbraid, Starts;—and these lines, with hurried pen pourtray'd, Slides in his half-clos'd hand;—and speeds away.— “Ye eyes, ye human stars!—if, thus conceal'd “By sleep's soft veil, ye agitate my heart, “Ah! what had been its conflict if reveal'd “Your rays had shone!”—Bright nymph, thy strains impart Hopes, that impel the graceful bard to rove, Seeking thro' Tuscan vales his visionary love. SONNET LXXV. SUBJECT CONTINUED. He found her not:—yet much the Poet found, To swell Imagination's golden store, On Arno's bank, and on that bloomy shore, Warbling Parthenope; in the wide bound, Where Rome's forlorn Campania stretches round Her ruin'd towers and temples;—classic lore Breathing sublimer spirit from the power Of local consciousness.—Thrice happy wound, Given by his sleeping graces, as the fair “Hung over them enamour'd,” the desire Thy fond result inspired, that wing'd him there, Where breath'd each Roman and each Tuscan lyre, Might haply fan the emulative flame, That rose o'er Dante's song, and rival'd Maro's fame. SONNET LXXVI. THE CRITICS OF DR JOHNSON'S SCHOOL. In jargon, like the following, copied from a Review, are works of Genius perpetually criticised in our public prints:— “Passion has not sufficient coolness to pause for metaphor, nor “has metaphor ardour enough to keep pace with passion.”— Nothing can be less true. Metaphoric strength of expression will burst even from vulgar and illiterate minds when they are agitated. It is a natural effort of roused sensibility in every gradation, from unlettered simplicity to the highest refinement. Passion has no occasion to pause for metaphors, they rush upon the mind which it has heated. Similies, it is true, are not natural to strong emotion. They are the result of spirits that are calm, and at leisure to compare. Lo! modern critics emulously dare Ape the great despot; throw in pompous tone And massy words their true no-meaning down! But while their envious eyes on Genius glare, While axioms false assiduously they square In arrogant antithesis, a frown Lours on the brow of Justice, to disown The kindred malice with its mimic air. Spirit of Common Sense! must we endure The incrustation hard without the gem? Find in th' Anana's rind the wilding sour, The oak's rough knots on every osier's stem? The dark contortions of the Sybil bear, Whose inspirations never meet our ear? SONNET LXXVII. O! hast thou seen a vernal morning briht Gem every bank and trembling leaf with dews, Tinging the green fields with her amber hues, Changing the leaden streams to lines of light? Then seen dull clouds, that shed untimely night, Roll envious on, and every ray suffuse, Till the chill'd scenes their early beauty lose, And faint, and colourless, no more invite The glistening gaze of joy?—'Twas emblem just Of my youth's sun, on which deep shadows fell, Spread from the Pall of Friends; and Grief's loud gust Resistless, oft would wasted tears compel: Yet let me hope, that on my darken'd days Science, and pious Trust, may shed pervading rays. SONNET LXXVIII. Sophia tempts me to her social walls, That 'mid the vast Metropolis arise, Where splendour dazzles, and each pleasure vies In soft allurement; and each science calls To philosophic domes, harmonious halls, And storied galleries. “And storied windows richly dight.” Il Penseroso. With duteous sighs, Filial and kind, and with averted eyes, I meet the gay temptation, as it falls From a seducing pen.—Here—here I stay, Fix'd by Affection's power; nor entertain One latent wish, that might persuade to stray From my aged nurseling, in his life's dim wane; But, like the needle, by the magnet's sway, My constant trembling residence maintain. SONNET LXXIX. While unsuspecting trust in all that wears Virtue's bright semblance stimulates my heart To find its dearest pleasures in the part Taken in other's joys; yielding to theirs Its own desires, each latent wish that bears The selfish stamp, O! let me shun the art Taught by smooth Flattery in her courtly mart, Where Simulation's studied smile ensnares! Scorn that exterior varnish for the mind, Which, while it polishes the manners, veils In showy clouds the soul.—E'en thus we find Glass, o'er whose surface clear the pencil steals, Grown less transparent, tho' with colours gay, Sheds but the darken'd and ambiguous ray. SONNET LXXX. As lightens the brown hill to vivid green When juvenescent April's showery sun Looks on its side, with golden glance, at noon; So on the gloom of life's now faded scene Shines the dear image of those days serene, From Memory's consecrated treasures won; The days that rose, ere youth, and years were flown, Soft as the morn of May;—and well I ween If they had clouds, in Time's alembic clear They vanish'd all, and their gay vision glows In brightness unobscur'd; and now they wear A more than pristine sunniness, which throws Those mild reflected lights that soften care, Loss of lov'd friends, and all the train of woes. SONNET LXXXI. ON A LOCK OF MISS SARAH SEWARD'S HAIR, WHO DIED IN HER TWENTIETH YEAR. My Angel Sister, tho' thy lovely form Perish'd in youth's gay morning, yet is mine This precious ringlet!—still the soft hairs shine, Still glow the nut-brown tints, all bright and warm With sunny gleam!—Alas! each kindred charm Vanish'd long since; deep in the silent shrine Wither'd to shapeless dust!—and of their grace Memory alone retains the faithful trace.— Dear Lock, had thy sweet owner liv'd, ere now Time on her brow had faded thee!—My care Screen'd from the sun and dew thy golden glow; And thus her early beauty dost thou wear, Thou all of that fair frame my love could save From the resistless ravage of the grave! SONNET LXXXII. From a riv'd tree, that stands beside the grave Of the self-slaughter'd, to the misty moon Calls the complaining owl in night's pale noon; And from a hut, far on the hill to rave Is heard the angry Ban-Dog. With loud wave Yon rous'd and turbid river surges down, Swoln with the mountain-rains, and dimly shown Appals our sense.—Yet see! from yonder cave, Her shelter in the recent, stormy showers, With anxious brow, a fond expecting maid Steals towards the flood!—Alas!—for now appears Her lover's vacant boat!—the broken oars Roll down the tide!—What images invade! Aghast she stands, the statue of her fears! SONNET LXXXIII. ON CATANIA AND SYRACUSE SWALLOWED UP BY AN EARTHQUAKE. FROM THE ITALIAN OF FILACAJA. Here, from laborious Art, proud Towns, ye rose! Here, in an instant, sunk!—nor aught remains Of all ye were!—on the wide, lonely plains Not e'en a stone, that might these words disclose, “Here stood Catania;”—or whose surface shows That this was Syracuse:—but louring reigns A trackless Desolation.—Dim domains! Pale, mournful strand! how oft, with anxious throes, Seek I sad relics, which no spot supplies!— A Silence—a fix'd Horror sears my soul.— Inexplicable doom of human crimes, What art thou?—Ye o'erwhelmed cities, rise! That your terrific skeletons may scowl Portentous warning to succeeding times! SONNET LXXXIV. While one sere leaf, that parting Autumn gilds, Trembles upon the thin, and naked spray, November, dragging on his sunless day, Lours, cold and sullen, on the watry fields; And Nature to the waste dominion yields, Stript her last robes, with gold and purple gay.— So droops my life, of your soft beams despoil'd, Youth, Health, and Hope, that long exulting smil'd; And the wild carols, and the bloomy hues Of merry Spring-time, spruce on every plain Her half-blown bushes, moist with sunny rain, More pensive thoughts in my sunk heart infuse Than Winter's grey, and desolate domain, Faded, like my lost youth, that no bright Spring renews. SONNET LXXXV. TO MARCH. March, tho' the hours of promise with bright ray May gild thy noons, yet, on wild pinion borne, Loud winds more often rudely wake thy morn, And harshly hymn thy early-closing day. Still the chill'd earth wears, with her tresses shorn, Her bleak, grey garb:—yet not for this we mourn, Nor, as in Winter's more enduring sway, With festal viands, and associates gay, Arm 'gainst the skies;—nor shun the piercing gale; But, with blue cheeks, and with disorder'd hair, Meet its rough breath;—and peep for primrose pale, Or lurking violet, under hedges bare; And thro' long evenings, from our Lares claim The thrift of stinted grate, and sullen flame. SONNET LXXXVI. TO THE LAKE OF KILLARNEY. This Sonnet was written on having read a deseription of the Killarney scenery immediately after that of the Vale of Vaucluse, uncultivated and comparatively desert as the latter has been through more than the present century. Pride of Ierne's sea-encircled bound, Rival of all Britannia's Naiads boast, Magnificent Killarney!—from thy coast Tho' mountains rise with noblest woods embrown'd; Tho' ten-voiced echoes send the cannon's sound In thunders bursting the vast rocks around, Till startled wonder and delight exhaust In countless repercussion—isles embost Upon thy liquid glass; their bloomy veil Sorbus and arbutus;—yet not for thee So keenly wakes our local ecstacy, As o'er the narrow, barren, silent dale, Where deeply sleeps, rude circling rocks among, The love-devoted fount enamour'd Petrarch sung. SONNET LXXXVII. TO A YOUNG LADY, ADDRESSED BY A GENTLEMAN, CELEBRATED FOR HIS POETICAL TALENTS. Round Cleon's brow the Delphic laurels twine, And lo! the laurel decks Amanda's breast! Charm'd shall he mark its glossy branches shine On that contrasting snow; shall see express'd Love's better omens, in the green hues dress'd Of this selected foliage.—Nymph, 'tis thine The warning story on its leaves to find, Proud Daphne's fate, imprison'd in its rind, And with its umbrage veil'd; great PhŒbus' power Scorning, and bent, with feet of wind, to foil His swift pursuit, till on Thessalian shore Shot into boughs, and rooted to the soil.— Thus warn'd, fair maid, Apollo's ire to shun, Soon may his spray's and Votary's lot be one. SONNET LXXXVIII. [The three following Sonnets are written in the character of Werter; the sentiments and images chiefly, but not entirely, taken from one of his letters.] THE PROSPECT A FLOODED VALE. Up this bleak hill, in wintry night's dread hour, With mind congenial to the scene, I come! To see my Valley in the lunar gloom, To see it whelm'd.—Amid the cloudy lour Gleamsthe cold moon;—and shows the ruthless power Of yon swoln floods, that white with turbid foam Roll o'er the fields;—and billowy as they roam, Against the bushes beat!—A vale no more, A troubled sea, toss'd by the furious wind!— Alas! the wild and angry waves efface Pathway, and hedge, and bank, and stile!—I find But one wide waste of waters!—In controul Thus dire, to tides of misery and disgrace Love opes the flood-gates of my struggling soul. SONNET LXXXIX. SUBJECT CONTINUED. Yon late but gleaming moon, in hoary light Shines out unveil'd, and on the cloud's dark fleece Rests;—but her strengthen'd beams appear to increase The wild disorder of this troubled night. Redoubling echoes seem yet more to excite The roaring winds and waters!—Ah! why cease Resolves, that promis'd everlasting peace, And drew my steps to this incumbent height? I wish!—I shudder!—stretch my longing arms O'er the steep cliff!—My swelling spirits brave The leap, that quiets all these dire alarms, And floats me tossing on yon stormy wave! But Oh! what roots my feet?—what spells, what charms The daring purpose of my soul enslave? SONNET XC. SUBJECT CONTINUED. My hour is not yet come!—these burning eyes Have not yet look'd their last!—else, 'mid the roar Of this wild Storm, what gloomy joy to pour My freed, exhaling soul!—sublime to rise, Rend the conflicting clouds, inflame the skies, And lash the torrents!—Bending to explore Our evening seat, my straining eye once more Roves the wide wat'ry waste;—but nought descries Save the pale flood, o'erwhelming as it strays. Yet Oh! lest my remorseless fate decree That all I love, with life's extinguished rays Sink from my soul, to sooth this agony, To balm that life, whose loss may forfeit thee, Come dear Remembrance of Departed Day. SONNET XCI. On the fleet streams, the sun, that late arose, In amber radiance plays;—the tall young grass No foot hath bruis'd—clear morning, as I pass, Breathes the pure gale, that on the blossom blows; And, as with gold yon green hill's summit glows, The lake inlays the vale with molten glass.— Now is the year's soft youth;—yet me, alas! Cheers not as it was wont;—impending woes Weigh on my heart!—the joys, that once were mine, Spring leads not back;—and those that yet remain Fade while she blooms.—Each hour more lovely shine Her crystal beams, and feed her floral train; But ah with pale, and waning fires, decline Those eyes, whose light my filial hopes sustain. SONNET XCII. Behold that tree in Autumn's dim decay, Stript by the frequent, chill, and eddying wind; Where yet some yellow, lonely leaves we find Lingering and trembling on the naked spray, Twenty, perchance, for millions whirl'd away! Emblem, alas! too just, of human kind! Vain Man expects longevity, design'd For few indeed; and their protracted day What is it worth that Wisdom does not scorn? The blasts of Sickness, Care, and Grief appal, That laid the friends in dust, whose natal morn Rose near their own!—and solemn is the call;— Yet, like those weak, deserted leaves forlorn, Shivering they cling to life, and fear to fall SONNET XCIII. Yon soft star, peering o'er the sable cloud, Sheds its green lustre The lustre of the brightest of the stars always appeared to me of a green hue; and they are so described by Ossian. thro' the darksome air.— Haply in that mild planet's crystal sphere Live the freed spirits, o'er whose timeless shroud Swell'd my lone sighs, my tearful sorrows flow'd. They, of these long regrets perhaps aware, View them with pitying smiles.—O! then, if e'er Your guardian cares may be on me bestow'd, For the pure friendship of our youthful days, Ere yet ye soar'd from earth, illume my heart, That roves bewilder'd in Dejection's night, And lead it back to peace!—as now ye dart, From your pellucid mansion, the kind rays, That thro' misleading darkness stream so bright. SONNET XCIV. All is not right with him, who ill sustains Retirement's silent hours.—Himself he flies, Perchance from that insipid equipoise, Which always with the hapless mind remains That feels no native bias; never gains One energy of will, that does not rise From some external cause, to which he hies From his own blank inanity.—When reigns, With a strong cultur'd mind, this wretched hate To commune with himself, from thought that tells Of some lost joy, or dreaded stroke of fate He struggles to escape;—or sense that dwells On secret guilt towards God, or Man, with weight, Thrice dire, the self-exiling flight impels. SONNET XCV. On the damp margin of the sea-beat shore Lonely at eve to wander;—or reclined Beneath a rock, what time the rising wind Mourns o'er the waters, and, with solemn roar, Vast billows into caverns surging pour, And back recede alternate; while combin'd Loud shriek the sea-fowls, harbingers assign'd, Clamorous and fearful, of the stormy hour; To listen with deep thought those awful sounds; Gaze on the boiling, the tumultuous waste, Or promontory rude, or craggy mounds Staying the furious main, delight has cast O'er my rapt spirit, and my thrilling heart, Dear as the softer joys green vales impart. SONNET XCVI. The breathing freshness of the shining morn, Whose beams glance yellow on the distant fields, A sweet, unutterable pleasure yields To my dejected sense, that turns with scorn From the light joys of dissipation born. Sacred Remembrance all my bosom shields Against each glittering lance she gaily wields, Warring with fond regrets, that silent mourn The heart's dear comforts lost.—But, Nature, thou, Thou art resistless still;—and yet I ween Thy present balmy gales, and vernal blow, To Memory owe the magic of their scene; For with such fragrant breath, such orient rays, Shone the soft mornings of my youthful days. SONNET XCVII. TO A COFFIN-LID. LICHFIELD, MARCH 1790. Thou silent door of our eternal sleep, Sickness, and pain, debility, and woes, All the dire train of ills existence knows, Thou shuttest out for ever!—Why then weep This fix'd tranquillity,—so long!—so deep! In a dear Father's clay-cold form?—where rose No energy, enlivening Health bestows, Thro' many a tedious year, that used to creep In languid deprivation; while the flame Of intellect, resplendent once confess'd, Dark, and more dark, each passing day became. Now that angelic lights the Soul invest, Calm let me yield to thee a joyless frame, Thou silent Door of Everlasting Rest. SONNET XCVIII. Since my griev'd mind some energy regains, Industrious habits can, at times, repress The weight of filial woe, the deep distress Of life-long separation; yet its pains, Oft do they throb along these fever'd veins.— My rest has lost its balm, the fond caress Wont the dear aged forehead to impress At midnight, as he slept;—nor now obtains My uprising the blest news, that could impart Joy to the morning, when its dawn had brought Some health to that weak frame, o'er whichmy heart With fearful fondness yearn'd and anxious thought.— Time, and the Hope that robs the mortal dart Of its fell sting, shall cheer me—as they ought. SONNET XCIX. ON THE VIOLENT THUNDER STORMS. DECEMBER 1790. Remorseless Winter! in thy iron reign Comes the loud whirlwind, on thy pinion borne; The long, long night,—the tardy, leaden morn; The grey frost, riv'ling lane, and hill, and plain; Chill silent snows, and heavy pattering rain. These are thy known allies;—and life forlorn, Yet patient, droops, nor breathes repinings vain; But now, usurper, thou hast madly torn From Summer's hand his stores of angry sway; His rattling thunders with thy winds unite, On thy pale snows those livid lightnings play, That pour their deathful splendours o'er his night, To poise the pleasures of his golden day, Soft gales, blue skies, and long-protracted light. SONNET C. WRITTEN DECEMBER 1790. Lyre of the Sonnet, that full many a time Amus'd my lassitude, and sooth'd my pains, When graver cares forbade the lengthen'd strains, To thy brief bound, and oft-returning chime A long farewell!—the splendid forms of rhyme When grief in lonely orphanism reigns, Oppress the drooping soul.—Death's dark domains Throw mournful shadows o'er the Æonian clime; For in their silent bourne my filial bands Lie all dissolv'd;—and swiftly-wasting pour From my frail glass of life, health's sparkling sands. Sleep then, my Lyre, thy tuneful tasks are o'er; Sleep! for my heart bereav'd, and listless hands, Wake with rapt touch thy glowing strings no more! TO MÆCENAS. BOOK THE FIRST, ODE THE FIRST. I. Mæcenas, from Etrurian princes sprung, For whom my golden lyre I strung, Friend, Patron, Guardian of its rising song, O mark the youth, that towers along, With triumph in his air; Proud of Olympic dust, that soils His burning cheek and tangled hair! Mark how he spreads the palm, that crown'd his toils! Each look the throbbing hope reveals That his fleet steeds and kindling wheels, Swept round the skilfully-avoided goal, Shall with illustrious chiefs his echo'd name enrol. II. Who the civic crown obtains, Or bears into his granaries large The plenteous tribute of the Libyan plains; Or he, who watches still a rural charge, O'er his own fields directs the plough, Sees his own fruitage load the bough; These would'st thou tempt to brave the faithless main, And tempt with regal wealth, thy effort should be vain. I. The stormy south howls thro' the sullen cloud, Contending billows roar aloud! The merchant sees the gathering danger rise, And sends a thousand yearning sighs To his dear shelter'd home.— Its shades receive him;—but the tides Grow smooth;—the wild winds cease to roam; And see!—his new-trimm'd vessel gaily rides!— Fir'd with the hope of wealth, once more He quits, so hardly gain'd, the shore; Watches, with eager eye, th' unfurling sail, Nor casts one look behind to the safe, sylvan vale. II. The youth of gay, luxurious taste, The Romans, in general, made no regular meal till the business of the day was over. They considered a mid-day feast as a mark of indolence and luxury. Breaks, in the arbutus' soft shade, The precious day with interrupting feast; Or quaffs, by some clear fountain in a glade, The mellow wine of ruby gleam, While in vain the purer stream Courts him, as gently the green bank it laves To blend th' enfevering draught with its pellucid waves. I. Th' uplifted trumpet, and the clarion, send, Confus'd, the mingled clang afar; Lo! while the matron's tender breast they rend, Her soldier hails that din of war.— The wood-land Chase desired, Far other sound the hunter charms; By the enlivening shout inspired, Her breaks from his young bride's encircling arms; Nor heeds the morning's wintry gale, While his deep-mouth'd hounds inhale The tainted breeze, or hold the stag at bay, Or while, from his strong toils, the wild boar bursts away. II. Thee bright Learning's ivy crown “Diis miscent superis.] A manner of expression not “unusual amongst the Greeks and Latins, for any eminent degree “of happiness. Unless we adopt this explanation of the “words, says Dacier, we shall make Horace guilty of a manifest “contradiction, since a few lines farther he tells his patron, “that his suffrage, not the ivy crown is that, which will “exalt him to the skies. The judicious emendation of the late “Bishop of Chichester, who for Me doctarum, reads Te doctarum, “removes all objection; and adds beauty to the Ode by “the fine compliment it contains to Mæcenas.”— Brom. Hor. Exalts above a mortal fate; Me shady groves, light nymphs, and satyrs brown, Raise o'er the crowd, in sweet sequester'd state. And there is heard the Lesbian lute, And there Euterpe's Dorian flute; But, should'st thou rank me with the Lyric Choir, To Glory's starry heights thy Poet would aspire.— TO PYRRHA. BOOK THE FIRST, ODE THE FIFTH. Where roses flaunt beneath some pleasant cave, Too charming Pyrrha, what enamour'd boy, Whose shining locks the breathing odours lave, Woos thee, exulting in a transient joy? For whom the simple band dost thou prepare, That slightly fastens back thy golden hair? Alas! how soon shall this devoted youth Love's tyrant sway, and thy chang'd eyes deplore, Indignant curse thy violated truth, And count each broken promise o'er and o'er, Who hopes to meet, unconscious of thy wiles, Ingenuous looks, and ever facile smiles! He, inexperienc'd mariner! shall gaze In wild amazement on the stormy deep, Recall the flattery of those sunny days, That lull'd each ruder wind to calmest sleep. 'Twas then, with jocund hope, he spread the sail, In rash dependence on the faithless gale. Ah wretch! to whom untried thou seemest fair! By me, who late thy halcyon surface sung, The walls of Neptune's fane Horace alludes to the custom of the Roman mariners after a shipwreck—that of suspending their garments, which had been drenched in the storm, in the temple of Neptune, together with a votive tablet, on which the circumstances of the danger and escape, were nainted. inscrib'd, declare That I have dank and dropping garments hung, Devoted to the God, whose kind decree Snatch'd me to shore, from an o'erwhelming sea. TO MUNATIUS PLANCUS. He had been twice Consul; was of Brutus' and Cassius' party, but went over to Augustus, who received him with kind respect. However he revolted from him, persuaded by the friends of Marc Antony, that the battle of Actium would decree the Empire to that General. The event, so contrary, brought Munatius back to the feet of Augustus, but he was not received with former kindness, nor did he deserve it, and retired, chagrined, to his fine seat at Tivoli, in the wood of Tiburnus, so called from the neighbouring city, Tibur. There also, and near the falls of Tivoli, described at full in Mr Gray's letters, Horace had a villa. The poet, perceiving the spirits of Munatius dejected, writes this Ode to reconcile him to his destiny, and to inspire him with delight in the beautiful scenery by which he was surrounded; insinuating, that should Augustus banish him, which was no improbable event, he ought not to despond, but to form his conduct upon the spirited example of Teucer; who, together with his friends and followers' was banished his native city, Salamis, by his father, because he had not revenged upon the Greeks the death of his brother Ajax.—The disinterested design of this Ode, and the humane attention it pays to a disgraced nobleman, are much to the poet's honour, who was perhaps, in general, more disposed to gratulate the powerful, than to sooth the unfortunate. BOOK THE FIRST, ODE THE SEVENTH. Be far-famed Rhodes The capital of an island of the same name in the Mediterranean, and famous for the Colessal Statue. the theme of loftier strains, Or Mitylene, The chief city of Lesbos, praised by Cicero for its advantageous situation, elegant buildings, and fertile soil. as their bard decrees; Or Ephesus, where great Diana reigns, Or Corinth, towering 'twixt the rival seas; Or Thebes, illustrious in thy birth divine, Purpureal Bacchus;—or of Phœbus' shrine, Delphos oracular; or warbling hail Thessalian Tempe's flower-embroider'd vale. The art-crown'd city, chaste Minerva's pride, There are, whose endless numbers have pourtray'd; They, to each tree that spreads its branches wide, Prefer the tawny Olive's It was believed that Minerva presented the seed of the olive-tree to the Athenians. scanty shade. Many, in Juno's honour, sing thy meads, Green Argos, glorying in thy agile steeds; Or opulent Mycene, whose proud fanes The blood of murder'd Agamemnon stains. Nor patient Lacedæmon wakes my lyre, Who trains her sons to all the warrior's toil; Nor me Larissa's A beautiful city, upon one of the hills in Thessaly. airy graces fire, Tho' round her hills the golden vallies smile: But my loved mansion, 'mid the circling wood, On the green bank of clear Albunea's flood, Its walls resounding with the echo'd roar, As Anio's torrents down the mountain pour. Amid my blooming orchards pleas'd I rove, Guiding the ductile course of murmuring rills; Or mark the curtains of the sacred grove Sink in the vales, or sweep along the hills. Ah, friend! if round my cell such graces shine, This surely must be the poet's meaning in mentioning his own villa, when he is endeavouring to awaken in Munatius a taste for the surrounding beauties of his more magnificent seat. Commentators rationally conclude that some connecting lines have been lost from the Latin of this Ode. It appears to me, that the idea which those dismembered lines conveyed, must necessarily have been the comparison added in the four ensuing lines, which makes the transition easy. The Palace of Tiburnian shades is thine; She every feature of the scene commands, And Empress of its varied beauty stands. Tho' frequent mists the young Favonius shroud, Bending his flagging wing with heavy rains, Yet oft he chases every showery cloud, Winnowing, with pinion light, th' aerial plains; Ah! thus from thee let each dark vapour roll, That rash Ambition gathers on the soul; The jocund pleasures in her absence rise, Glow in the breast, and sparkle in the eyes. And thou, Munatius, whether fate ordain The camp thy home, with glancing javelins bright; Or if the graces of that fair domain, Umbrageous Tivoli, thy steps invite; If trumpets sound the clang that warriors love, Or round thee trill the choirings of the grove, In flowing bowls drown every vain regret, Enjoy the Present, and the Past forget! The walls of Salamis when Teucer fled, Driven by a parent's unrelenting frown, Hope from his spirit chased each anxious dread, While on his brow he bound the poplar crown; In rich libation pour'd the generous wine, Then bath'd his temples in the juice divine; And thus, with gladden'd eye, and air sedate, Address'd the drooping followers of his fate. “Wherever Destiny, a kinder friend “Than he who gave me birth, may point the way, “Thither resolv'd our duteous steps shall bend, “Nor know presaging fear, nor weak delay. “Doubt flies when Teucer leads, and cold despair, “In Teucer's auspices, shall melt to air; “Phœbus ordains that, in more favouring skies, “Another prosp'rous Salamis shall rise. “So much alike her fountains, fanes, and bowers, “That e'en her name shall dubious meaning bear;— “Then, my lov'd friends, who oft, in darker hours, “Have shar'd with me a conflict more severe, “O! let us lose in wine our sorrow's weight, “And rise the masters of our future fate! “This night we revel in convivial ease, “To-morrow seek again the vast and pathless seas.” TO LYDIA. BOOK THE FIRST, ODE THE EIGHTH. O, Lydia! I conjure thee tell Why, with persisting zeal, thou dost employ The strongest power of amorous spell On Sybaris, belov'd too well, Wounding his fame amid voluptuous joy? Why shuns he now the noon-tide glare, Inur'd to whirling dust, and scorching heat? Ceases the warrior-vest to wear In which he us'd, with graceful air, Aspiring youths, all emulous, to meet? Why is it now no more his pride To rein the ardent horse with agile arm? With new-strung sinews to divide The yellow Tyber's angry tide, When the tempestuous showers its rage alarm? Why hates he, as the viper's gore, The wrestler's oil, that supples every vein? Why do we see his arms no more With livid bruises spotted o'er, Of manly sports the honourable stain? 'Twas his to whirl, with matchless skill, The glancing quoit, the certain javelin throw, While crowds, with acclamations shrill, The lofty circus joy'd to fill, And all the honours of the day bestow. Such fond seclusion why desire?— Thus Thetis' care her blooming son conceal'd, Ere yet commenc'd that contest dire, When mournful gleam'd the funeral pyre, Thro' ten long years, on Ilium's purpled field. In vain the female vest he wore, That Love maternal might avert his fate; Lest his spear drink the Lycian gore, Lest sinking Troy his force deplore, And Death with Glory meet him at her gate. TO THALIARCHUS. This Ode was probably written at the country seat of that nobleman, near the mountain Soracte, in Tuscany, twenty-six miles from Rome. BOOK THE FIRST, ODE THE NINTH. In dazzling whiteness, lo! Soracte towers, As all the mountain were one heap of snow! Rush from the loaded woods the glittering showers; The frost-bound waters can no longer flow. Let plenteous billets, on the glowing hearth, Dissolve the ice-dart ere it reach thy veins; Bring mellow wines to prompt convivial mirth, Nor heed th' arrested streams, or slippery plains. High Heaven, resistless in his varied sway, Speaks!—The wild elements contend no more; Nor then, from raging seas, the foamy spray Climbs the dark rocks, or curls upon the shore. And peaceful then yon aged ash shall stand; In breathless calm the dusky cypress rise; To-morrow's destiny the Gods command, To-day is thine;—enjoy it, and be wise! Youth's radiant tide too swiftly rolls away; Now, in its flow, let pleasures round thee bloom; Join the gay dance, awake the melting lay, Ere hoary tresses blossom for the tomb! Spears, and the steed, in busy camps impel; And, when the early darkness veils the groves, Amid the leafless boughs let whispers steal, While frolic Beauty seeks the near alcoves. Soft as thy tip-toe steps the mazes rove, A laugh, half-smother'd, thy pleas'd ear shall meet, And, sportive in the charming wiles of love, Betray the artifice of coy retreat; And then the ring, or, from her snowy arm, The promis'd bracelet may thy force employ; Her feign'd reluctance, height'ning every charm, Shall add new value to the ravish'd toy. TO LEUCONOE. BOOK THE FIRST, ODE THE ELEVENTH. Leuconoe, cease presumptuous to inquire Of grave diviner, if successive years Onward shall roll, ere yet the funeral pyre, For thee and me, the hand of Friendship rears! Ah rather meet, with gay and vacant brow, Whatever youth, and time, health, love, and fate allow; If many winters on the naked trees Drop in our sight the paly wreaths of frost, Or this for us the last, that from the seas Hurls the loud flood on the resounding coast.— Short since thou know'st the longest vital line, Nurse the near hope, and pour the rosy wine. E'en while we speak, our swiftly-passing youth Stretches its wing to cold Oblivion's shore; Then shall the future terrify, or sooth, Whose secrets no vain foresight can explore? The Morrow's faithless promise disavow, And seize, thy only boast, the Golden Now. TO APOLLO. BOOK THE FIRST, ODE THE THIRTY-FIRST. What asks the Poet, when he pours His first libation in the Delphic Bowers? Duteous before the altar standing, With lively hope his soul expanding, O! what demands he, when the crimson wine Flows sparkling from the vase, and laves the golden shrine? Not the rich and swelling grain That yellows o'er Sardinia's isle; Nor snowy herds, slow winding thro' the plain, When warm Calabria's rosy mornings smile; Nor gold, nor gems, that India yields, Nor yet those fair and fertile fields, Which, thro' their flow'ry banks as calm he glides, The silent Liris' A beautiful river of remarkably placid current. It rises near Sora, a city of Latium, which it divides from Campania. azure stream divides. Let those, for whom kind fortune still Leads lavish tendrils o'er the sloping hill, Let such, with care their vineyard dressing, Their bursting grapes assiduous pressing, Gather, self-gratulant, the costly store, And of the future year propitious suns implore! May luscious wines, in cups of gold, Oft for the wealthy merchant flow! Nor let cold Thrift those plenteous draughts withhold That prosperous Commerce shall again bestow. The flowing bowl he safely drains, Since every favouring God ordains That more than once, The Poet deems it a peculiar mark of the favour of the Deities when the merchant is enabled safely to make repeated voyages in one year through hazardous seas. within the circling year, His prow shall o'er the smooth Atlantic steer. Me, let tawny olives feed! Me, lenient mallows from the simple mead! Son of Latona, grant the blessing, That, a cloudless mind possessing, And not infirm of frame, in soft decay, Cheer'd by the breathing lyre, my life may pass away! TO HIS ATTENDANT. BOOK THE FIRST, ODE THE THIRTY-EIGHTH. Boy, not in these Autumnal bowers Shalt thou the Persian vest dispose, Of artful fold, and rich brocade; Nor tie in gaudy knots the sprays and flowers. Ah! search not where the latest rose Yet lingers in the sunny glade; Plain be the vest, and simple be the braid! I charge thee, with the myrtle wreath Not one resplendent bloom entwine; We both become that modest band, As stretch'd my vineyard's ample shade beneath, Jocund I quaff the rosy wine; While near me thou shalt smiling stand, And fill the sparkling cup with ready hand. TO SALLUST. BOOK THE SECOND, ODE THE SECOND. Dark in the Miser's chest in hoarded heaps, Can gold, my Sallust, one true joy bestow, Where sullen, dim, and valueless it sleeps, Whose worth, whose charms, from circulation flow? Ah! then it shines attractive on the thought, Rises, with such resistless influence fraught As puts to flight pale Fear, and Scruple cold, Till Life, e'en Life itself, becomes less dear than Gold. Rome, of this power aware, thy honour'd name O Proculeius! ardently adores, Since thou did'st bid thy ruin'd brothers claim A filial right in all thy well-earn'd stores.— To make the good deed deathless as the great, Yet fearing for her plumes Icarian fate, Penna metuente solvimust surely be allusive to the dissolving pinions of Icarus—and mean, that deeds of private generosity are apt to melt from the recollection of mankind; while those of what is called heroic exertion go down to Posterity. For this idea of the passage the translator was indebted to a learned friend. This record, Fame, of precious trust aware, Shall long, on cautious wing, solicitously bear. And thou, my Sallust, more complete thy sway, Restraining the insatiate lust of gain, Than should'st thou join, by Conquest's proud essay, Iberia's hills to Libya's sandy plain; Than if the Carthage sultry Afric boasts, With that which smiles on Europe's lovelier coasts, Before the Roman arms, led on by thee, Should bow the yielding head, the tributary knee. See bloated Dropsy added strength acquire As the parch'd lip the frequent draught obtains; Indulgence feeds the never-quench'd desire, That loaths the viand, and the goblet drains. Nor could exhausted floods the thirst subdue Till that dire Cause, which spreads the livid hue O'er the pale form, with watry languor swell'd, From the polluted veins, by medicine, be expell'd. Virtue, whate'er the dazzled vulgar dream, Denies Phraates, seated on thy throne, Immortal Cyrus, Joy's internal gleam, And thus she checks the crowd's mistaken tone; “He, only he, who, calmly passing by, “Not once shall turn the pure, unwishing eye “On heaps of massy gold, that near him glare, “My amaranthine wreath, my diadem shall wear.” TO THE HONOURABLE THOMAS ERSKINE. UORACE, BOOK THE SECOND, ODE THE THIRD, IMITATED. OCTOBER, 1796. Conscious the mortal stamp is on thy breast, O, Erskine! still an equal mind maintain, That wild Ambition ne'er may goad thy rest, Nor Fortune's smile awake thy triumph vain, Whether thro' toilsome tho' renowned years 'Tis thine to trace the law's perplexing maze, Or win the Sacred Seals, whose awful cares To high decrees devote thy honour'd days. Where silver'd poplars with the stately pines Mix their thick branches in the summer sky, And the cool stream, whose trembling surface shines, Laboriously oblique, is hurrying by; There let thy duteous train the banquet bring, In whose bright cups the liquid ruby flows, As life's warm season, on expanded wing, Presents her too, too transitory rose; While every Muse and Grace auspicious wait, As erst thy handmaids, when, with brow serene, Gay thou didst rove where Buxton views elate A golden palace deck her savage scene. The author had the pleasure of passing a fortnight with Mr and Mrs Erskine at Buxton, in August 1796. At frequent periods woo th' inspiring band Before thy days their summer-course have run, While, with closed shears, the Fatal Sisters stand, Nor aim to cut the brilliant thread they spun. Precarious tenant of that gay retreat, Fann'd by pure gales on Hampstead's airy downs, Where filial troops for thee delighted wait, And their fair mother's smile thy banquet crowns! Precarious tenant!—shortly thou may'st leave These, and propitious Fortune's golden hoard; Then spare not thou the stores, that shall receive, When set thy orb, a less illustrious lord. What can it then avail thee that thy pleas Charm'd every ear with Tully's periods bland? Or that the subject passions they could seize, And with the thunder of the Greek command? What can it then avail thee that thy fame Threw tenfold lustre on thy noble line? Since neither birth, nor self-won glory, claim One hour's exemption from the sable shrine. E'en now thy lot shakes in the urn, whence Fate Throws her pale edicts in reverseless doom! Each issues in its turn, or soon, or late, And lo! the great man's prize!—a silent Tomb! TO BARINE. BOOK THE SECOND, ODE THE EIGHTH. Barine, to thy always broken vows Were slightest punishment ordain'd; Hadst thou less charming been By one grey hair upon thy polish'd brows; If but a single tooth were stain'd, A nail discolour'd seen, Then might I nurse the hope that, faithful grown, The Future might, at length, the guilty Past atone. But ah! no sooner on that perjur'd head, With pomp, the votive wreaths are bound, In mockery of truth, Than lovelier grace thy faithless beauties shed; Thou com'st, with new-born conquest crown'd, The care of all our youth, Their public care;—and murmur'd praises rise Where'er the beams are shot of those resistless eyes. Thy mother's buried dust;—the midnight train Of silent stars,—the rolling spheres, Each God, that list'ning bows, With thee it prospers, false-one! to profane. The nymphs attend;—gay Venus hears, And all deride thy vows; And Cupid whets afresh his burning darts On the stone, moist with blood, that dropt from wounded hearts. For thee our rising youth to manhood grow, Ordain'd thy powerful chains to wear; Nor do thy former slaves From the gay roof of their false mistress go, Tho' sworn no more to linger there; Triumphant Beauty braves The wise resolve;—and, ere they reach the door, Fixes the faltering step to thy magnetic floor. Thee the sage matron fears, intent to warn Her stripling;—thee the miser dreads, And, of thy power aware, Brides from the Fane with anxious sighs return, Lest the bright nets thy beauty spreads, Their plighted lords ensnare, Ere fades the marriage torch; nay even now, While undispers'd the breath, that form'd the nuptial vow! TO TITUS VALGIUS. This Ode is addressed to his friend, an illustrious Roman, who had lost a beloved son. The poetic literature of Titus Valgius is ascertained by the honourable mention made of him by Horace, in his Tenth Satire, Book the First. Valgius, like Sir Brooke Boothby, in these days had poured forth a train of elegiac sorrows over the blight of his filial hopes. Horace does not severely reprove these woes, he only wishes they may not be eternal, and that he will, at least, suspend them and share the public joy; for this Ode was composed while the splendid victories, which Augustus had obtained in the East, were recent. BOOK THE SECOND, ODE THE NINTH. Not ceaseless falls the heavy shower That drenches deep the furrow'd lea; Nor do continual tempests pour On the vex'd Caspian's The Caspian is a stormy and harbourless sea—Yet the poet observes that not even the Caspian is always tempestuous—insinuating, that inevitable as his grief must be for such a loss, it yet ought not to be incessant. billowy sea; Nor yet the ice, in silent horror, stands Thro' all the passing months on pale Armenia's lands. The coldness of Armenia is well known, surrounded as it is by the high mountains of Niphates, Pariades, Antiaurus, and Ararat, which are always covered with snow. Fierce storms do not for ever bend The mountain's vast and labouring oak, Nor from the ash its foliage rend, With ruthless whirl, and widowing stroke; But, Valgius, thou, with grief's eternal lays Mournest thy vanish'd joys in Mystes' shorten'd days. When Vesper trembles alike the evening and morning star —appearing first and remaining last in the horizon, it ushers in both the evening and the dawn. In the first instance it is called Vesper, or Hesperus, in the last Lucifer, or Phospher. in the west, Or flies before the orient sun, Rise the lone sorrows of thy breast.— Nor thus did aged Nestor shun Consoling strains, nor always sought the tomb, Where sunk his filial hopes, Antilochus, the son of Nestor, observing his father likely to fall in battle, by the sword of his adversary, threw himself between the combatants, and thus sacrificed his own life to preserve that of his parent. in life and glory's bloom. Not thus, the lovely Troilus slain, His parents wept the princely boy: Nor thus his sisters mourn'd, in vain, The blasted flower of sinking Troy; Cease, then, thy fond complaints!—Augustus' fame, The new Cesarian wreaths, let thy lov'd voice proclaim! So shall the listening world be told Medus, By the rivers Medus, and Niphates, are meant the Parthians, or Scythians, for they are the same people, and the Armenians. The river Tigris, rising in the cold mountain Niphates, Horace gives its name to the stream, as he does that of Medus to the Euphrates, which Plato asserts to have been formerly so called. Uniting those rivers in his verse, the poet means to denote the Roman conquest over two enemies widely distant from each other. and cold Niphates guide, With all their mighty realms controul'd, Their late proud waves in narrower tide; That in scant space their steeds the Scythians rein, The Scythians, or Parthians, were a warlike people, famous for their equestrian prowess, for the speed of their horses, and for the unerring aim of their arrows, shot when flying on full speed. Augustus obliged their king, Phraates, not only to restore the Roman standards and prisoners, taken many years before, but to withdraw his troops from Armenia. Nor dare transgress the bounds our victor arms ordain. TO LICINIUS MURENA. Licinius Murena was a Patrician of high rank, one of the brothers of Proculeius, whose fraternal generosity is celebrated in the Ode to Sallust, the ninth of these Paraphrases. The property of Licinius had been confiscated for having borne arms against the second Triumvirate. Upon this confiscation Proculeius divided two-thirds of that large fortune, with which the Emperor had rewarded his valour and fidelity in the royal cause, between Licinius, and his adopted brother, Terentius, whose fortunes had suffered equal wreck on account of the party he had taken. Horace wrote this Ode soon after the affectionate bounty of Proculeius had restored his friend to affluence. It breathes a warning spirit towards that turbulent, and ambitious temper, which Horace perceived in this young nobleman. The poet, however, has used great address and delicacy, making the reflections not particular but general; and he guards against exciting the soreness people feel from reprehension for their prevailing fault, by censuring with equal freedom the opposite extreme. That kind caution insinuated in this Ode, proved eventually vain, as did also the generosity of the Emperor, who soon after permitted Licinius to be chosen Augur;—probably at the intercession of his favourite Mæcenas, who had married Terentia, a daughter of that house, and whom Horace calls Licinia in the Ode which is next paraphrased. Upon the election of Licinius to this post of honour, trust, and dignity, we perceive the spirits of Horace greatly elevated; probably as much from the pleasure he knew Mæcenas would take in the promotion of his brother-inlaw, as from the attachment himself bore to Licinius. A peculiar air of hilarity shines out in the Ode addressed to Telephus, written the evening on which this Licinius, then newly chosen Augur, gave his first supper to his friends. The reader will find it somewhat lavishly paraphrased in the course of this selection. By the above Ode the poet seems to have feared the seditious disposition of Licinius:—but when he afterwards strung his lyre to notes of triumph for the honours of his friend, he little imagined that friend would finally suffer death for ungratefully conspiring against the monarch, who had so liberally overlooked his former enmity. BOOK THE SECOND, ODE THE TENTH. Not always, dear Licinius, is it wise On the main sea to ply the daring oar; Nor is it safe, from dread of angry skies, Closely to press on the insidious shore. To no excess discerning spirits lean, They feel the blessings of the golden mean; They will not grovel in the squalid cell, Nor seek in princely domes, with envied pomp to dwell. They pine, that lifts so high her stately boughs, Writhes in the storms, and bends beneath their might, Innoxious while the loudest tempest blows O'er trees, that boast a less-aspiring height. As the wild fury of the whirlwind pours, With direst ruin fall the loftiest towers; And 'tis the mountain's summit that, oblique, From the dense, lurid clouds, the baleful lightnings strike. A mind well disciplin'd, when sorrow lours, Not sullenly excludes Hope's smiling rays; Nor, when soft Pleasure boasts of lasting powers, With boundless trust the promiser surveys. It is the same dread Jove, who thro' the sky Hurls the loud storms, that darken as they fly; And whose benignant hand withdraws the gloom, And spreads rekindling light in all its living bloom. To-day the soul perceives a weight of woe;— A brighter morrow shall gay thoughts inspire. Does Phœbus always bend the vengeful bow? Wakes he not often the harmonious lyre? Epidemic diseases were, by the Pagans, believed to be the effect of having offended Apollo. The arrows he shoots among the Greeks in the first Book of the Iliad, produce the pestilence, which follows the rape of his Priest's daughter, Chryseis. When we consider the dependence of the human constitution upon the temperate, or intemperate influence of the sun, the avenging bow of Phœbus appears an obvious allegory; —and since it is in the hours of health that the fine arts are sought and cultivated, the sun, under the name of Phœbus, Apollo, &amp;c. is with equal propriety of fable, supposed their patron, as well as the avenger of crimes by the infliction of diseases. Be thou, when danger scowls in every wave, Watchful, collected, spirited, and brave; But in the sunny sky, the flattering gales, Contract, with steady hand, thy too expanded sails. TO MÆCENAS. Of that artful caution, which marks the character of Horace, this Ode forms a striking instance. He declines the task appointed by his patron, that of describing the Italian wars, because he foresees that in its execution he must either disoblige the Emperor and his Minister, by speaking too favourably of their enemies, or offend some friends, whom he yet retained amongst those, who had exerted themselves against the Cæsars. Horace endeavours to soften the effect of this noncompliance by a warm panegyric upon Licinia, the betrothed bride of Mæcenas.She is in other places called Terentia. Both these names have affinity to those of her brothers, Licinius, afterwards Augur, and her adopted brother, Terentius. Horace mentions plainly the Numantian wars, and those with Hannibal, but artfully speaks of those of Brutus, and Cassius, and of the character of Antony, under fabulous denominations, sufficiently understood by Augustus, and his Minister. Dacier justly observes how easy it is to discern, that by the Lapithæ, and Giants, defeated by Hercules on the plains of Thessaly, the poet means the armies of Brutus, and Cassius, defeated by Augustus, almost in the same place, at the battle of Philippi. He concludes also that by Hylæus is meant Mark Antony, who assumed the name of Bacchus, and ruined himself by his profligate passion for Cleopatra. Another commentator observes, that as the Giants, and Lapithæ, are said to have made the palace of Saturn shake, so also did Brutus, and Cassius, and afterwards Mark Antony, make all Italy tremble, and that it is Rome itself that Horace would have to be understood by the magnificent Palace of Saturn. Some critics seek to destroy all the common sense, beauty, and character of this Ode, by denying the allegoric interpretation; and also by insisting that Licinia was the poet's own mistress, and not the mistress of his patron. It had been absurd, and inconceivably unmeaning, if, when he was requested to sing the triumphs of Augustus in the Italian wars, he should, during the brief mention of them, have adverted to old fables, uniting them, not as a simile, but in a line of continuation with the Numantian, and Carthaginian wars; unless, beneath those fables, he shadowed forth the Roman enemies of Augustus. The idea that Licinia was the mistress of Horace, has surely little foundation:—for it were strange indeed if he could take pleasure in describing amorous familiarities between Mæcenas, and the person with whom himself was in love. One of these critics alleges, as the reason why this lady could not be the destined bride of Mæcenas, that it would have been as indiscreet in him to have admitted Horace to be a witness of his passion for Licinia-Terentia, as it would have been impertinent in the poet, to have invaded the privacies of his patron. It is not necessary, from this Ode, to conclude that Horace had witnessed the tender scene he describes. He might, without any hazard of imputed impertinence, venture to paint, from his imagination, the innocently playful endearments of betrothed lovers. The picture was much more likely to flatter than to disgust the gay, and gallant Mæcenas. BOOK THE SECOND, ODE THE TWELFTH. Mæcenas, I conjure thee cease To wake my harp's enamour'd strings To tones, that fright recumbent Peace, That Pleasure flies on rapid wings! Slow conquest on Numantia's plain, Or Hannibal, that dauntless stood, Tho' thrice he saw Ausonia's main Redden with Carthaginian blood; The Lapithæ's remorseless pride, Hylæus' wild inebriate hours; The Giants, who the Gods defied, And shook old Saturn's splendid towers; These, dear Mæcenas, thou should'st paint, Each glory of they Cæsar's reign, In eloquence, that scorns restraint, And sweeter than the poet's strain; Show captive kings, who from the fight Drag at his wheels their galling chain, And the pale lip indignant bite With mutter'd vengeance, wild and vain. Enraptur'd by Licinia's grace, My Muse would these high themes decline, Charm'd that the heart, the form, the face Of matchless excellence is thine. Ah, happy friend! for whom an eye, Of splendid, and resistless fire, Lays all its pointed arrows by, For the mild gleams of soft desire! With what gay spirit does she foil The pedant's meditated hit! What happy archness in her smile! What pointed meaning in her wit! Her cheek how pure a crimson warms, When with the Nymphs, in circling line, Bending she twines her snowy arms, And dances round Diana's shrine! The Roman ladies, according to ancient custom, danced with entwined arms, around the Altar of Diana, on the day of her Festival. Mæcenas, would'st not thou exchange The treasures gorgeous Persia pours, The wealth of Phrygia's fertile range, Or warm Arabia's spicy shores, For one light ringlet of the hair, Which shades thy sweet Licinia's face, In that dear moment when the fair, In flying from thy fond embrace, Relenting turns her snowy neck, To meet thy kisses half their way, Or when her feign'd resentments check The ardours thy warm lips convey? While in her eyes the languid light Betrays a yielding wish to prove, Amid her coy, yet playful flight, The pleasing force of fervent love; Or when, in gaily-frolic guise, She snatches her fair self the kiss, E'en at the instant she denies Her lover the requested bliss? TO POSTHUMUS. BOOK THE SECOND, ODE THE FOURTEENTH. Alas! my Posthumus, the years Unpausing glide away; Nor suppliant hands, nor fervent prayers, Their fleeting pace delay; Nor smooth the brow, when furrowing lines descend, Nor from the stoop of age the faltering frame defend. Time goads us on, relentless sire! On to the shadowy shape, that stands Terrific on the funeral pyre, Waving the already kindled brands.— Thou canst not slacken his reluctant speed, Tho' still on Pluto's shrine thy Hecatomb should bleed. Beyond the dim lake's mournful flood, That skirts the verge of mortal light, He chains the forms, on earth that stood Proud, and gigantic in their might; That gloomy lake, o'er whose oblivious tide Kings, Consuls, Pontiffs, Slaves, in ghastly silence glide. In vain the bleeding field we shun, In vain the loud and whelming wave; And, as autumnal winds come on, And wither'd leaves bestrew the cave, Against their noxious blast, their sullen roar, In vain we pile the hearth, in vain we close the door. The universal lot ordains We seek the black Cocytus' stream, That languid strays thro' dreary plains, Where cheerless fires perpetual gleam; Where the fell brides their fruitless toil bemoan, And Sisyphus uprolls the still-returning stone. Thy tender wife, thy large domain, Soon shalt thou quit, at Fate's command; And of those various trees, that gain Their culture from thy fost'ring hand, The Cypress only shall await thy doom, Follow its short-liv'd Lord, and shade his lonely tomb! TO LYCE, ON HER REFUSING TO ADMIT HIS VISITS. BOOK THE THIRD, ODE THE TENTH. Now had you drank cold Tanais' wave, Whose streams the drear vale slowly lave, A barbarous Scythian's bride; Yet, Lyce, might you grieve to hear Your lover braves the winds severe, That pierce his aching side. O listen to the howling groves, That labour o'er your proud alcoves, And hear the jarring door! Mark how the star, at eve that rose, Has brightly glaz'd the settled snows, While every leaf is hoar! Gay Venus hates this cold disdain;— Cease then its rigours to maintain, That sprightly joys impede, Lest the strain'd cord, with which you bind The freedom of my amorous mind, In rapid whirl recede! Born of a jocund Tuscan sire, Did he transmit his ardent fire, That, like Ulysses' Queen, His beauteous daughter still should prove Relentless to the sighs of love, With frozen heart and mien?— If nor blue cheek of shivering swain, Nor yet his richest gifts obtain Your smile, and soft' ning brow; Nor if a faithless husband's rage For a gay Syren of the stage, And broken nuptial vow; If weak e'en Jealousy should prove To bend your heart to truer love, Yet pity these my pains, O Nymph, than oaks more hard, and fierce As snakes, that Afric's thickets pierce, Those terrors of the plains! When heavy falls the pattering shower, And streaming spouts their torrents pour Upon my shrinking head, Not always shall wild Love command These limbs obsequiously to stand Beneath your dropping shed. TO THE FOUNTAIN OF BLANDUSIA. It was common with the Antients to consecrate fountains by a sacrifice, and vinous libations, poured from goblets crowned with flowers. Lively imaginations glow over the idea of such a beautiful ceremony. BOOK THE THIRD, ODE THE THIRTEENTH. Nymph of the stream, whose source perpetual pours The living waters thro' the sparkling sand, Cups of bright wine, enwreath'd with summer flowers, For rich libation, round thy brink shall stand, When on the morrow, at thy Bard's decree, A young and spotless kid is sacrificed to thee. He, while his brows the primal antlers swell, Conscious of strength, and gay of heart, prepares To meet the female, and the foe repel.— In vain he wishes, and in vain he dares! His ardent blood thy pebbly bed shall stain, Till each translucent wave flows crimson to the plain. In vain shall Sirius shake his fiery hairs O'er thy pure flood, with waving poplars veil'd, For thou, when most his sultry influence glares, Refreshing shade, and cooling draughts shalt yield To all the flocks, that thro' the valley stray, And to the wearied steers, unyok'd at closing day. Now dear to Fame, sweet fountain, shalt thou flow, Since to my lyre those breathing shades I sing That crown the hollow rock's incumbent brow, From which thy soft loquacious waters spring. To vie with streams Aonian be thy pride, As thro' Blandusia's Vale thy silver currents glide! TO TELEPHUS. At the feast, held in honour of Licinius Murena having been chosen Augur, Horace endeavours to turn the conversation towards gayer subjects than Grecian Chronology, and the Trojan war, upon which his friend Telephus had been declaiming; and for this purpose seems to have composed the ensuing Ode at table. It concludes with a hint, that the unpleasant state of the poet's mind, respeeting his then mistress, incapacitates him for abstracted themes, which demand a serene and collected attention, alike inconsistent with the amorous discontent of the secret heart, and with the temporary exhilaration of the spirits, produced by the occasion on which they were met. This must surely be the meaning of Horace in this Ode, however obscurely expressed. People of sense do not, even in their gayest conversation, start from their subject to anoher of total inconnection. When the latent meaning in the concluding verses is perspicuously paraphrased, it accounts for the poet's preference at that period, of trifling to literary subjects. These slight, and often obscure allusions, closely, and what is called faithfully translated, give a wild and unmeaning air to the Odes of Horace, which destroys their interest with the unlearned admirers of poetry. To give distinct shape and form to these embryo ideas, often capable of acquiring very interesting form and shape, is the aim of these Paraphrases. Telephus, who was a Greek, appears to have been a youth of noble birth—being mentioned as such in the Ode to Phyllis, which will be found farther on amongst these Paraphrases. From that to Lydia, so well known, and so often translated, we learn that he had a beautiful form, and was much admired by the Roman ladies. BOOK THE THIRD, ODE THE NINETEENTH. The number of the vanish'd years That mark each famous Grecian reign, This night, my Telephus, appears Thy solemn pleasure to explain; Or else assiduously to dwell, In conscious eloquence elate, On those who conquer'd, those who fell At sacred Troy's devoted gate. But at what price the cask, so rare, Of luscious Chian may be ours, Who shall the tepid baths prepare, And who shall strew the blooming flowers; Beneath what roof we next salute, And when shall smile these gloomy skies, Thy wondrous eloquence is mute, Nor here may graver topics rise.— Fill a bright bumper to the moon! She's new!—auspicious be her birth! One to the midnight!—'tis our noon Of jocund thought, and festal mirth! And one to him, for whom the feasts This night are held with poignant gust, The translator was doubtful about using that word, till she recollected it in the gravest of Pope's Poems, “Destroy all creatures for thy sport and gust; “Then cry, If man's unhappy God's unjust.” Essay on Man. Murena, whom his Rome invests With solemn honours, sacred trust! Kind omens shall his voice convey, That may each rising care beguile; Propitious fled the birds to-day? Will Love be ours, and Fortune smile?— Arrange the cups of various size, The least containing bumpers three, And nine the rest.—Come, no disguise! Nor yet constraint, the choice is free! All but the Bard's—the bowl of nine He is, in duty, bound to fill; The Muses number to decline Were treason at Aonia's hill. For here the Sisters shall preside, So they allow us leave to laugh; Unzoned the Graces round us glide, While we the liquid ruby quaff. Yet they, in kind and guardian care, Dreading lest wild inebriate glee With broils disturb our light career, Would stint us to their number, three. Away, ye prudes!—the caution wise Becomes not this convivial hour, That every dull restraint defies, And laughs at all their frigid power.— Thou say'st I rave;—and true thou say'st, Nor must thou check the flowing vein, For sprightly nonsense suits him best Whom grave reflection leads to pain. Why mute the pipe's enlivening note? Why sleeps the charming lyre so long? O! let their strains around us float, Mix'd with the sweet and jocund song! And lavish be the roses strewn! Ye flutes, ye lyres, exulting breathe! The festal hour disdains to own The mournful note, the niggard wreath. Old Lycon, with the venal fair, Who courts yet hates his vile embrace, Our lively strains shall muttering hear, While Envy pales each sullen face: Thou, with thy dark luxuriant hair, Thou, Telephus, as Hesper bright, Thou art accomplish'd Chloe's care, Whose glance is love's delicious light. Thy utmost wish the fair-one crowns, And thy calm'd heart may well pursue The paths of knowledge;—Lyce frowns, And I, distasteful, shun their view. From themes, that wake the powers of mind, The wounded spirit sickening turns; To those be then this hour consign'd, That Mirth approves, tho' Wisdom spurns. They shall disarm my Lyce's frown, The frolic jest, the lively strain, In flowing bowls, shall gaily drown The memory of her cold disdain. TO PHYLLIS. EXHORTING HER TO BE CONTENT WITH A FRUGAL SACRIFICE. BOOK THE THIRD, ODE THE TWENTY-THIRD. My Phidyle, retired in shady wild, If thou thy virgin hands shalt suppliant raise, If primal fruits are on thy altars pil'd, And incense pure thy duteous care conveys, To sooth the Lares, when the moon adorns, With their first modest light, her taper horns; And if we pierce the throat of infant swine, A frugal victim, not the baleful breath Of the moist South shall blast our tender vine; Nor shall the lambs sink in untimely death, When the unwholesome gales of Autumn blow, And shake the ripe fruit from the bending bough. Let snowy Algidum's wide valleys feed, Beneath their stately holme, and spreading oak, Or the rich herbage of Albania's mead, The steer, whose blood on lofty shrines shall smoke! Red may it stain the Priest's uplifted knife, And glut the higher powers with costly life! The rosemary and myrtle's simple crown Thou on our household Gods, with decent care, Art gently placing; and they will not frown; No stern demand is theirs, that we prepare Rich flocks, and herds, at duty's solemn call, And, in the pomp of slaughter, bid them fall. O! if an innocent hand approach the shrine, The little votive cake it humbly lays, The crackling salt, that makes the altar shine, Flung on the cheerful sacrificial blaze, To the mild Lares shall be grateful found As the proud steer, with all his garlands crown'd. TO MELPOMENE. BOOK THE FOURTH, ODE THE THIRD. Not he, O Muse! whom thy auspicious eyes In his primeval hour beheld, Shall victor in the Isthmian contest rise; Nor o'er the long-resounding field Impetuous steeds his kindling wheels shall roll, Gay in th' Olympic race, and foremost at the goal. Nor in the Capitol, triumphant shown, The victor-laurel on his brow, For cities storm'd, and vaunting kings o'erthrown;— But Tibur's streams, that warbling flow, And groves of fragrant gloom, rssound his strains, Whose sweet Eolian grace high celebration gains. Now that his name, her noblest Bards among, Th' imperial city loudly hails, That proud distinction guards his rising song, When Envy's carping tongue assails; In sullen silence now she hears his praise, Nor sheds her canker'd spots upon his springing bays. O Muse! who rulest each melodious lay That floats along the gilded shell, Who the mute tenant of the watry way Canst teach, at pleasure, to excel The softest note harmonious sorrow brings, When the expiring swan her own sad requiem sings,— Thine be the praise, that pointing Romans guide The Stranger's eye with proud desire That well he note the man, whom crowds decide Should boldly string the Latian lyre.— Ah! when I charm, if still to charm be mine, Nymph of the warbling shell, be all the glory Thine! TO WILLIAM HAYLEY, Esq, BOOK THE FOURTH, ODE THE SEVENTH, IMITATED. The snows dissolve, the rains no more pollute, Green are the sloping fields, and uplands wide, And green the trees luxuriant tresses shoot, And, in their daisied banks, the shrinking rivers glide. Beauty and Love the blissful change have hail'd, While, in smooth mazes, o'er the painted mead, Aglaia The eldest of the Graces. ventures, with her limbs unveil'd, Light thro' the dance each Sister-Grace to lead. But O! reflect, that sport, and beauty, wing Th' unpausing hour!—if Winter, cold and pale, Flies from the soft, and violet-mantled Spring, Summer, with sultry breath, absorbs the vernal gale. Reflect, that Summer-glories pass away When mellow Autumn shakes her golden sheaves; While she, as Winter reassumes his sway, Speeds, with disorder'd vest, thro' rustling leaves. But a short space the moon illumes the skies; Yet she repairs her wanings, and again Silvers the vault of night;—but no supplies, To feed their wasting fires, the lamps of life obtain. When our pale forms shall pensive vigils keep Where Collins, Akenside, and Shenstone roam, Or quiet with the Despot, Johnson, sleep, In that murk cell, the body's final home, To senseless dust, and to a fleeting shade Changes the life-warm being!—Ah! who knows If the next dawn our eye-lids may pervade? Darken'd and seal'd, perchance, in long, and last repose. When vivid thought's unceasing force assails, It shakes, from life's frail glass, the ebbing sands; Their course run out, ah! what to us avails Our fame's high note, tho' swelling it expands! Reflect, that each convivial joy we share Amid encircling Friends, with grace benign, Escapes the grasp of our rapacious heir;— Pile then the steaming board, and quaff the rosy wine! Illustrious Hayley!—in that cruel hour, When o'er thee Fate the sable flag shall wave, Not thy keen wit, thy fancy's splendid power, Knowledge, orworth, shall snatch thee from the grave. Not to his Mason's grief, from Death's dim plains Was honour'd Gray's departed form resign'd; No tears dissolve the cold Lethean chains, That, far from busy life, the mortal semblance bind. Then, for the bright creations of the brain, O! do not thou from health's gay leisure turn, Lest we, like tuneful Mason, sigh in vain, And grasp a timeless, tho' a Laurel'd Urn! TO LIGURIA. BOOK THE FOURTH, ODE THE TENTH. O Thou! exulting in the charms, Nature, with lavish bounty, showers, When youth no more thy spirit warms, And stealing age thy pride alarms, For fleeting graces, and for waning powers; When all the shining locks, that now Adown those ivory shoulders bound, With deaden'd colour shade thy brow, And fall as from th' autumnal bough Leaves, that rude winds have scatter'd on the ground; And on that cheek the tints, that shame May's orient light and Summer's rose, Dim as yon taper's sullen flame, Shall, in a dusky red, proclaim That not one hue in wonted lustre glows; When wrinkles o'er Liguria's face Their daily strengthening furrows lead; When faithful mirrors cease to place In her charm'd sight each blooming grace, And will no more her heart's proud triumph feed; Then the chang'd maid, with secret shame, Shall thus the past, and present chide; O! why, amid the loud acclaim, That gave my rising charms to fame, Swell'd this coy bosom with disdainful pride? Or why, since now the wish to yield Steals pensive thro' each melting vein, The ice dissolv'd, that scorn congeal'd, And every tender thought reveal'd, Why, vanish'd Beauty, com'st not thou again? TO PHYLLIS. INVITING HER TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTH-DAY OF MÆCENAS. BOOK THE FOURTH, ODE THE ELEVENTH. Sweet Phyllis, leave thy quiet home, For lo! the ides of April come! Then hasten to my bower; A cask of rich Albanian wine, In nine years mellowness, is mine, To glad the festal hour. My garden-herbs, in fragrance warm, Our various chaplets wait to form; My tender ivies grow, That, twining in thy amber hair, Add jocund spirit to thine air, And whiteness to thy brow. My walls with silver vessels shine; Chaste vervin decks the modest shrine, That longs with crimson stains To see its foliage sprinkled o'er, When the devoted lamb shall pour The treasure of his veins.

A wealthier maid, in pleasing chains, Illustrious Telephus It is agreed that this is the same young nobleman to whom the Ode is addressed, on Licinius being appointed Augur, and which has been paraphrased in this Collection. detains, From humble Thee withdrawn. When pride would daring hopes create, Of Phaeton recall the fate, Consumed in his career! Let rash Bellerophon, who tried The fiery Pegasus to guide, Awake thy prudent fear! Thus warn'd, thy better interest know, And cease those charming eyes to throw On youths of high degree! Come then, of all my loves the last, For, every other passion past, I only burn for thee! Come, and with tuneful voice rehearse The measures of thy Poet's verse And charm the list'ning throng! Believe me, fairest, all our cares Will soften at the melting airs That deck the lyric song. ON THE PLEASURES OF RURAL LIFE. The reader will remember, that in the course of these Paraphrases the design has been avowed of stretching the pictures of Horace upon a wider canvas, of filling up what are so often mere outlines. If learned eyes ever glance over this Ode, it is hoped they will not frown upon the many circumstances and reflections which have been added, upon a presumption, induced by the pleasing nature of the subject, since the Roman customs and manners are preserved with fidelity. Those customs and manners, resulting from their festal, gay, and picturesque religion, cannot surely be presented without proving interesting. Yet, to create this interest, stronger and more circumstantial description seems required than can be found in Horace, if the Paraphraser may be allowed to judge of the poetic feelings of others by her own. It was doubtless sufficient for his contemporary readers, and for those of some succeeding generations, that he slightly alluded to events and ceremonies, which were familiar to their recollection. In our day more precision is demanded, at least by those who have poetic taste without knowledge of the dead languages, or intimacy with the national and domestic customs of that time, and of that people. Also, to strengthen this necessary interest in the mind of the reader, it must be eligible to infuse a more liberal portion of those sentiments and ideas, which speak to the heart in every age, and in every climate. To scholars the fascinating music of the Latin tones and measures, and the elegance with which Horace knew to select, and to regulate them, recompence the obscurity which is so frequent in his allusions, and in the violence of his transitions from one subject to another, between which the line of connection is with difficulty traced. What is called a faithful translation of these Odes cannot, therefore, be interesting to unlearned lovers of verse, how alive soever they may be to poetic beauty.—A literal translation in the plainest prose, will always shew the precise quantity of real poetic matter, contained in any production, independent of the music of its intonation, and numbers, and the elegance of its style.—The prose translations of Horace's Odes evince that their merit does not consist in the plenitude of poetic matter, or essence, constituted by circumstances of startling interest, by exalted sentiment, impassioned complaint, or appeal, distinct and living imagery, happy apposite allusion, and sublime metaphor; but in certain elegant verbal felicities and general charm of style, produced by the force and sweetness of the Latin language, subservient to the fine ear, the lively and exquisite taste of Horace. These are the graces which we find so apt to evaporate in translation, while genuine Poetic Matter, as defined above, is capable of being transfused into any other language without losing a particle of its excellence, provided the chemist, who undertakes the operation, has genius and skill. The more this poetic matter in an author abounds, the more close and faithful a translator, who has judgment, may venture to render nis version —but to transfuse merely verbal felicities into another language is an attempt scarcely less fruitless than to clasp the rainbow. A kindred nothingness, as to poetic value, ensues. There is, however, a considerable, though not abounding quantity of poetic matter, or essence, in Horace; but it bears no proportion to the profusion of those evanescent glories, which will not bear the grasp of another language. To give that essence in increased quantity, and in the frecdom of unimitative numbers is attempted in this selection. Dryden and Pope translated upon that plan, and hence their Paraphrases have the spirit of original poems. Ere this note closes, its Author desires to observe, that painters cannot take a striking likeness of a face in which there is no predominant feature, and the poet can only make his image, or description, distinct, animated, and forcible, by bringing forward some characteristic trait of the object he is presenting. When Horace says in this Ode, “How pleasing is it to see “the well-fed sheep hastening home,” the observation is not picturesque, and therefore does not strongly impress the imagination; but when he adds—“to see the weary oxen dragging, “with languid neck, the inverted ploughshare,” he give perhaps the most poetic feature in this Ode. Had he only said, “to see the oxen returning from their labour,” his oxen had been as much without character as his sheep, and the sentence must have passed unimpressive over the mind of the reader. It is the words—dragging, with languid neck, the inverted ploughshare, that makes the sentence Poetry, and empowers it to arrest and charm the fancy. Had Horace always written thus, undeviating fidelity had been the best aim of his translator, and the sure way of rendering him delightful in every language. BOOK THE FIFTH, EPODE THE SECOND. I. Thrice happy he, whose life restores The pleasures pure of early times; That ne'er, with anxious heart, explores The rugged heights ambition climbs; Exempt from all the din, the toil, the care, That cities for their busy sons prepare; Fatigue, beneath the name of pleasure, Contentious law, usurious treasure, A tedious mean attendance on the great, And emulation vain of all their pomp and state. II. Not his sound and balmy sleep The trumpet's martial warning breaks; Nor the loud billows of the angry deep, When thro' the straining cords the tempest shrieks; But the morning's choral lay, Chanted wild from every spray. Swift at the summons flies the wilder'd dream, And up he springs alert, to meet the orient beam. I. The vine-clad hill he lightly scales, Dacier observes that vines supported on the highest trees produce wines of the most exquisite flavour. Where tall the frequent poplars rise, From branch to branch assiduous trails The pendent clusters rich supplies; And cautious prunes the weak, the useless shoot, Engrafting healthier boughs, that promise fruit.— Then his arms serenely folding, And the smiling scene beholding, Marks, as the fertile valley winds away, His flocks and lowing herds, in ample numbers stray. II. Then to the warm bank below, Yellow with the morning-ray, And sees his shelter'd hives in even row, And hears their hum mix with the linnet's lay. Recent from the crystal springs Many a vessel pure he brings, In them, from all the waxen cells to drain The fragrant essence rich of flow'ry dale and plain. I. On the river's shady side White his gather'd flock appears, And, plung'd into the flashing tide, Their curl'd and snowy fleece he shears; But when, 'mid laughing fields diffusive spread, Majestic Autumn rears her placid head, Wreath'd with wheaten garlands yellow, Bearing various fruitage mellow, How gladly from the trees, that loaded stand, Shakes he the ripen'd pears, engrafted by his hand; II. Or his swelling grapes, that vie With the fleece of Tyrian stain! Such precious gifts his grateful cares supply To thee protector of his wide domain, Bounteous Sylvanus!—and to thee, The garden's watchful Deity; Beneath your favouring power he little cares Who wields the Lictor's rod, or who the fasces bears. I. In sultry noon's oppressive ray, Beneath the holme, of ample shade, His listless limbs he loves to lay On herbage, matted in the glade; Hears down the steeps the white rills dashing play, Till under the long grass they purl away; While, on wing of swift vibration, Murmuring range the honied nation, And the sweet stock-dove, the thick boughs among, His dewy slumber courts with her complaining song. II. Loud when wintry winds arise, And the feeble race appal, While o'er the earth, from dim and thicken'd skies, The flaky snows in white profusion fall, Then the sylvan chace he seeks;— Lo! furious from the thicket breaks The gnashing boar!—Flies he, or stands at bay, Into the circling toils the staunch dogs drive the prey. I. When thro' the clear, and sparkling air, Fleet the pointed darts of frost, The filmy nets, now here, now there, For thievish birds, are lightly toss'd; Or, plac'd with silent heed, the wily snares, To lure the stranger-cranes, and timid hares. Rich viands they, whose pleasing flavour Crown his board, reward his labour. In those convivial hours the heart forgets Its vain tumultuous hopes, and all its fond regrets. II. These the pleasures unalloy'd, That brighten oft the rural scene; But, if yet dearer joys supply the void, That, even there, will sometimes intervene When days are cold, and nights are long, And business goes a little wrong, Should an endearing faithful Wife be seen, With the warm light of love she chases gloomy spleen. I. As the Sabine matron chaste, Active as th' Apulian wife, See she assumes, with cheerful haste, The pleasing cares of wedded life; Draws the clean vestment o'er the little limbs, And, when the tearful eye of passion swims, With mild authority commanding, Repressing ill, and good expanding, Anxious she weeds the infant heart betimes, Ere ill propension thrive, and ripen into crimes. II. Dusky grows the winter-eve, In hurdled cotes the flocks are penn'd; Her vessels pure the frothing milk receive, As from swell'd udders its full streams descend. Bright the crackling faggots blaze, While she strains the eager gaze, O'er the dim vale to see her husband come, With tir'd, yet willing step, to his warm, happy home. I. Her beating heart, and gladden'd eyes Perceive him ope the wicker gate; And swift her busy hand supplies The flowing bowl, the steaming plate; Her sparkling wine from their own vintage press'd, From their own stores her grateful viand dress'd; Less welcome far the proud collation, Cull'd with painful preparation, When earth, and air, and seas, have been explor'd For those expensive meats, that pile the Consul's board. II. Not the shell-fish, pampering food! Of Lucrine's azure lake the boast; Nor luscious product of the eastern flood, Driven by the stormy winds upon our coast; Nor costly birds, that hither rove Natives of Ionian grove, Can with more poignant zest his senses meet Than the love-kneaded cates, of this unpurchas'd treat. I. To his border's guardian power The feast of Terminus, one of the rural gods, was held on the first of February, at which time, in those warm climates, the spring is very forward. When he spreads the vernal feast, Then bleeds the kid, in lucky hour, From the hungry wolf releas'd; The Romans fancied that the struggle and terror of a kid on being seized by the wolf, made its flesh more tender. Then round the primal lamb's sweet flesh is seen The crisp salubrious herbage of the green; And, from loaded boughs descending, Unctuous olives richly blending; These form the dainties of his festal day, When every heart expands, and every face is gay. II. Circled by a jocund train, With joy the new-shorn flock he hears Come bleating homeward o'er the russet plain; While slow, with languid neck, the weary steers The inverted ploughshare drag along, Mindless of the shepherd's song; Then, round his smiling Household-Gods, surveys A numerous, menial group, the proof of prosperous days. I. 'Twas thus, amidst his ill-got wealth, The Roman usurer justly thought, Resolv'd to purchase peace and health, And live, at length, as Nature taught; No more with subtle avarice to lend, Oppressive foe beneath the name of friend! Now grasping views, for once, rejected, He on the Ides The middle of a month. his sums collected, But on the Calends, The beginning of the next month. lo! with anxious pain, On the same interest vast, he sends them forth again. II. Thus can lust of gold controul, Tho' the heart urge a wiser choice, By force of habit lord it o'er the soul, And stifle e'en Conviction's powerful voice. See, with sighs the miser yield The promis'd joys of wood, and field; Against experienc'd disappointment, try With gold to purchase that, which gold can never buy! TO NEAERA. BOOK THE FIFTH, EPODE THE FIFTEENTH. 'Twas night—the moon, upon her sapphire throne, High o'er the waning stars serenely shone, When thou, false Nymph, determin'd to prophane Them, and each power that rules the earth, and main, As thy soft, snowy arms about me twin'd Close as round oaks the clasping ivies wind, Swore, while the gaunt wolf shall infest the lea, And red Orion vex the wintry sea, While gales shall fan Apollo's floating locks, That shed their golden light o'er hills and rocks, So long thy breast should burn with purest fires, With mutual hopes, and with unchang'd desires. Perjur'd Neaera! thou shalt one day prove The worth, the vengeance of my slighted love; For O! if manhood steels, if honour warms, Horace shall fly, shall scorn thy faithless charms; Seek some bright maid, whose soul for him shall glow, Nor art, nor pride, nor wandering wishes knw. Then should'st thou languish, sigh, and weep once more, And with new vows his injur'd heart implore, Nor sighs, nor vows, nor tears shall he regard, Cold as the snow and as the marble hard. And Thou, triumphant youth, so gay, so vain, Proud of my fate, exulting in my pain, Tho' on thy hills the plenteous herd should feed. And rich Pactolus roll along thy meed; For thee tho' Science ope the varied store, And Beauty on thy form its graces pour, Ere long shalt thou, while wrongs like these degrade, Droop with my woes, and with my rage upbraid; See on a rival's brow thy garlands worn, And, with her falsehood, bear my jocund scorn. TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE, ON THEIR RENEWING THE CIVIL WARS. BOOK THE FIFTH, ODE THE SEVENTH. Where do ye rush, ye impious trains, Why gleams afar the late-sheath'd sword? Is it believ'd that Roman veins Their crimson tides have sparely pour'd? Is not our scorn of safety, health, and ease, Shewn by devasted climes, and blood-stain'd seas? Those scowling brows, those lifted spears, Bend they against the threat' ning towers Proud Carthage emulously rears? Or Britain's still unconquer'd shores? That her fierce sons, yet free from hostile sway, May pass in chains along our Sacred Way? No!—but that warring Parthia's curse May quickly blast these far-fam'd walls; Accomplish'd when, with direful force, By her own strength the city falls; When foes no more her might resistless feel, But Roman bosoms bleed by Roman steel. O! worse than wolves, or lions fierce, Who ne'er, like you, assault their kind! By what wild phrenzy would ye pierce Each other's breast in fury blind?— Silent and pale, ye stand with conscious sighs, Your struck soul louring in your down-cast eyes! The blood our rising walls that stain'd, Shed by the ruthless fratricide, Romulus, who killed his brother Remus, for ridiculing his wall by leaping over it. High Heaven's avenging power ordain'd Should spread the rage of discord wide, Bid kindred blood in dread profusion flow Thro' darken'd years of expiatory woe. GREVILLE AND JULIA Sleep is on man, and darkness all things hides, The English Ballad uses the past tense thro' the three first stanzas; this Paraphrase the more dramatic, more impressive present tense. The distant clocks, marking the midnight hour, is not in either the Ballad or the Latin poem. In William and Margaret, each stanza rhymes only twice, but the first has no rhyme. Our best writers use the imperfect rhymes freely, and I think to the advantage of their verse, as mourn and scorn, abode, and God, frost and coast;—but feet and sleep, which are given as rhymes in the exordium of that Ballad, are not within the bounds of privilege. And night's last hour the distant clocks repeat; The doors unfold!—dead Julia's image glides, Silent and slow,—and stands at Greville's feet! Her face like April morns when winds are loud, And wintry clouds deform the dubious day; See, from her feet she lifts the folding shroud, “And clay-cold was her lily hand “That held her sable shroud.” William and Margaret. The epithet lily is too nice and pretty for its situation, and sable seems utterly improper, since shrouds were white in Mallet's time, as in ours. Perhaps the epithet sable, temporarily inapplicable, has been one reason for believing the whole of this Ballad ancient, since it was probably the old custom to wrap the dead in black stuff, or linen. The gathering up the sepulchral robe from her feet, instead of merely holding it, is one of Vincent Bourne's variations, and adds the grace of motion to the figure. Statue-like stillness is not necessary to apparition -costume. The ghost in Hamlet beckons the prince to follow it. With snow-pale hands, cold as the weltering clay!— When youth is flown, and all that decks thee now, This apostrophe to a young prince is another improvement in the Latin version. It preserves the moral of the original and less spirited stanza, with heightened force from the personal address, and from the grand image in the third line. Compare it with the stanza in the Ballad: “So shall the fairest face appear “When youth and years are flown, “And such the robe that kings must wear “When death has reft their crown.” Here is no picture, and years after youth in the second line, form a pleonasm;—but the exquisite music produced by the alliteration in those two words, and by the number of vowels in the line, disarms criticism. Ah! royal Ciparissis, such thy doom; Then death shall strike the diadem from thy brow, The shroud thy robe, the lightless tomb thy home. Her form, while peace and hope were hers, was fair This stanza in the Ballad is common-place; in the Latin poem it is an original and charming description of a young beauty; yet to that which speaks only of her smiles and blushes, the charms of her eyes are added by the figure of the morning star in this Paraphrase. In the next stanza also, the discriminating “et faciles risus,” of the Latin version, is preserved by the epithet ready. A prompt smile is characteristic of early youth, though Vincent Bourne is the first poet who, by marked description, has recognized the propensity. The word gay does not, in itself, sufficiently express that facility of smile. As rising flowers beneath the beams of May; And her lips smiled and blush'd, and morn's bright star Stood in her eyes, as when it leads the day. But slow disease that kindling blush consumed, And grief eclips'd the gay and ready smile; No more the naked lip or laugh'd, or bloom'd;— Death call'd his worm, and gave th' untimely spoil. “Awake!—thy Julia calls thee!—Fate severe “Sends her pale corse to wander from the grave! “At length, O! now at length, let pity hear “Whom changed and faithless love refus'd to save. “Tandem, O nunc tandem,” the repetition greatly increases the pathos, and is closely rendered in this Elegy. “These dark, waste hours allow the restless ghost “To burst the cerements of the festering dead; “This is the dull, the dreary hour “When injur'd ghosts complain; “When yawning graves give up their dead “To haunt the faithless swain!” William and Margaret. Excellent as are the three first lines of this original stanza, yet the Latin quatrain strengthens the awful horrors of inhumation, and the re-translator flatters herself they have not here lost any of their terrific powers. Swain, in the last line of the stanza from William and Margaret, seems a botching appellation, used merely from the rhyme's necessity Whatever might have been the original meaning of the word swain, custom has attached to it a certain character of amorous effemi. nacy and tenderness ill-suited to the perfidious conduct of the accused, and the sepulchral solemnity of the accuser. “Terror of Him, who once to pity lost, “In vain remorse th'avenging doom may dread! “Thy oath!—thy pledge!—remember them, and fear!— “Now, if thou canst, thy barbarous crime atone! “Lo! thy too faithful maid, a spectre drear, “Gives back thy vows—and sternly claims her own! “This face, once gaz'd on with ecstatic eyes, “Once prais'd so fondly, why did'st thou desert? “Why, with thy tender looks, thy pleading sighs, “Win, but to desolate my yielding heart? “Thy promise, (ah! false promiser of joys!) “How could'st thou break, to crush my rising years? These parenthetic and passionate exclamations are all in the Latin poem, and add great effect to the solemn and upbraiding challenge. “Why flatter (cruel flatterer!) these eyes, “Yet leave them fading in unpitied tears? “How could'st thou say my lips, in early bloom, “Shamed the first crimson of the Summer's rose! “Why said'st thou so?—and why did I presume, “Rash maid, to credit thy deluding vows! “This alter'd face!—now does it bloom?—behold! “Nulla mihi heu! florit facies que floruit ecce!” How much more spirit in that line than in “This face, alas! no more is fair.” William and Margaret. The word, ecce! is a striking challenge to observe her changed face, and to contrast it with its former beauty. “This lip, this ghastly lip no blush retains! “Death is in these sunk eyes!—and on this cold “And livid cheek no lingering charm remains! “The hungry worm my wasting form devours, This line in the old Ballad is of most unpoetic construction, viz. “The hungry worm my sister is” “Feeds on these limbs, insatiate with her prey;— “A cold,—a long,—a tedious night is ours, “Till the late rising of the nightless day! “Hark!—the cock crows!—the warning note he gave; “Hark!—yet again!—A long—a last farewell! “Come, perjur'd, view thy gift!—the deep, dark grave “Where thy lost Julia's dismal relics dwell!” Now sing the birds, and from the purpling east The sun prepares to give the golden day!— Pale Greville, every horror in his breast, Leaps from his couch, and frantic speeds away; And to the tomb, the fatal tomb is flown, Where cold in death his injured Julia lay;— A moment stands by the rais'd turf!—then down, Headlong he falls on the dissolving clay. Thrice calls he, “Julia!” in a piercing sound, Thrice does he weep, and thrice, with groans, complain; Then, clasping wild the swell'd and hallow'd ground, Nor weeps!—nor groans!—nor speaks!—nor moves again! SONNET [Stranger, when o'er yon slant, warm field no cloud] Laid in the drawer of the thatched shed by the brook at Plas Nwydd, the Villa of the Right Hon. Lady Eleanor Butler, and Miss Ponsonby, in Llangollen Vale. WRITTEN IN AUTUMN 1799. Stranger, when o'er yon slant, warm field no cloud Steals,—at its foot, the verge of a wild brook, In tangled dell, where sun-beams never look, Press this screen'd seat, and mark the waters crowd Close to the cliff down their steep channel rude; Leaping o'er rugged stones, that aye provoke Foam and hoarse murmur; while the pendant oak Frowns o'er the little, clamorous, lonely flood.— Impetuous Deva's honours yield to thine, Dear brook, for O! thy scanty billows lave Friendship and Fancy's consecrated shrine; And thou may'st tell the stream of mightier wave, Here oft they muse the noontide hours away, Who gild thy vale with intellectual ray. SPEECH OF THE NYMPH OF THAT BROOK, WHICH, AFTER HEAVY RAIN, BECOMES A DEEP, VIOLENT, AND FORMIDABLE TORRENT. Lo! down yon steep of vales proud Deva borne, Rolls the hoarse treasures of her flashing urn! Yet bears my stream, as o'er the rocks it raves, Not tribute, but defiance to her waves. SONNET. This Sonnet is in the style of our elder poets, with whom the hyperbole was a favourite poetic figure. [Gay trips my nymph along the green retreat] Gay trips my nymph along the green retreat, With frolic airy steps; and where they go Fresh florets rise in twice their wonted glow; Yellower the sun-beams o'er the meadows fleet, Or fancies fond possess me. Her light feet, Glancing along, no other traces show; They bend not the young grass, that springs to meet The falling arch of April's showery bow; Nor bruise the emmet on her busy way; And if the downy blow-ball Ben Jonson's name for the seedvessels of the Dandelion. flies its stalk, So would it fly beneath the gentlest play Of western winds; when, with his tuneful talk, Amid new leaves, each songster of the grove Cheers on her mossy nest his listening love. A MEDITATION. In every season, every change of life, To give that zest which she can only give, Hope must preside incessant. Poverty, With all her train of ills;—th' unerring grasp Of grief and sickness;—thy soul-wasting powers, Pale-ey'd Captivity! without the aid, Cordial and sweet, of that associate mild, Who could support? Not e'en the happiest lot Here, in these low abodes of sin and care, Sustains her absence gladly.—Not the gifts Shower'd in the year's luxuriance; nor yet those Shook on all sides from Fortune's golden wheel, Might satisfy the soul, did not young Hope Stretch o'er the onward scene her potent wand, And give them brighter colouring. Thus all The vapid present yields, in its best mood, Leaves the sick heart unsatisfied;—but thou, Enchantress, blest of mission, canst sustain, Canst animate, and on the vermeil dawn, The white effulgent noon, and golden eve, Of bloomy Summer, shed ideal light, Which more than crowns their beauty. Thou canst lift With rosy hand, the veils of time, and pledge To youth the flowers of love;—to manhood point The paths of wealth and glory;—to worn age The downy couch, warm hearth, and social friend. But far beyond all these, sustain'd by faith, Thou canst extend the Heav'n-illumin'd torch Gilding the grave; and, past its darksome bourne, Disclosing the fair realms of joy and love Where Night and Winter never come;—nor pain, Nor dread of change;—but one celestial Morn Purples th' Immortal Year; and one bright Spring Of gratitude and bliss exhaustless flows Thro' the redeem'd, emancipated soul. THE TERRESTRIAL YEAR, ON HER PROGRESS THRO' THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC. JANUARY IN ARIES. Close to her ram cold January clings, And on his beard her pearly ice-drop flings; Awakes the shivering Year, yet young, to rise, Tho' wild winds whistle thro' the iron skies. FEBRUARY IN TAURUS. Like fair Europa, February stands, And wreathes her bull's stout neck with floral bands. Spurning the frozen circle, loud he roars, And scorns her snowy and her golden flowers. Pleas'd, yet with pensive smile, the dubious Year Welcomes that primal tribute to her sphere. MARCH IN GEMINI. March o'er the twins her stormy wing expands, And fills with violets sweet their infant hands; They sooth the Year, on her tempestuous way, Spite of her bleak blue cheek, and kirtle grey. APRIL IN CANCER. Young April laughs to see her Crab recede, Then wets with peevish tears the glistering mead; Soon, cheer'd again, on high her bow she bends; On the moist grass one lucid horn descends. With joy as wayward, she salutes the year, Placing a crystal crown upon her hair; With flowers and watry sun-beams wreathes it round, Then strikes it soil'd and darken'd, to the ground. Patient our timid Traveller deplores The wild caprice of April's veering hours; Now, 'mid soft gales, throws back her wintry vest, Now, in the rude storm, folds it o'er her breast; Turns the soft eye of Hope on lively May, Serene of smile, nor smiling to betray. MAY IN LEO. May, like celestial Una, mild and fair, Her Lion leads thro' roseate climes of air; In chains of hyacinth content to stray, He neither roars, nor rages on his way. The blue-ey'd month her gladden'd Mistress greets, And calls the vales to yield their bosom'd sweets; Bids morning clouds with orient tinges glow, Each clear brook warble, and each zephyr blow; Each silver'd hedge, each arbour, newly blown, And blossom'd fruit-tree, smile upon the sun; From their green centre, while the plumy throng Pour the wild music of the woodland song. JUNE IN VIRGO. June meets the Virgin with triumphant air, Each the gay handmaid of the passing Year; Charm'd they survey her, 'mid the zephyrs bland, Bright and consummate, on the zenith stand. She views on earth's warm fields, the rustics blithe, Sweep thro' the shivering grass the gleamy scythe; Stout maids th' exhaling treasure shake around, And ringing wains, yet empty, beat the ground. Now heap'd, thro' lanes, she sees them nodding slow, Scattering their fragrant litter as they go. So pass the hours of long-protracted light Till glimmering falls the scarcely curtain'd night. JULY IN LIBRA. And now the Year, first with descending pace, Slow down the Zodiac comes with smiling grace. July the yet unfaded beauty hails, And weighs her various gifts in golden scales. Luxuriant roses his moist temples shield From beams that smite the hill, and parch the field; Thro' the hush'd grove the lazy breezes sigh, And half the river's pebbly bed is dry. AUGUST IN SCORPIO. The glowing Year glides on, and to her clime Lo! zoneless August gives the golden time! Threads, indolent of step, th' etherial bound, And hears beneath the reaper's shout resound; Observes bright sheaves, like troops of dancers, stand On hills, and laughing fields, and crown the land; Sees full fruits redden in the sultry ray, Peer thro' the leaves, and bend the loaded spray. She bids her Scorpion hear the reapers sing, Sheath the fierce claw, nor dart the venom'd sting; But, from the waning dog-star, oft he sheds On stagnant pools, thick groves, and arid meads, The deadly virus, whence disease prevails, Steams from the loitering floods, and breathless dales. With plenty cloy'd the swart Month saunters on, And of the Sirian influence fearful grown, Scarce marks her mistress' path descending slope, And leaves obeisance to the months of hope. SEPTEMBER IN SAGITARIUS. With looks that speak an apprehensive heart, The Year perceives her summer joys depart, Tho' mild September by her archer stands, Bearing his arrows in her gentle hands; Or decks with wheaten ears her bended bow, While horn and hound the welkin rend below. OCTOBER IN CAPRICORN. Now tann'd October and his Goat, appear, And down the Zodiac lead the faded Year. Her pensive eyes his dusky hand behold Paint with fleck'd purple and with tarnish'd gold His rustling leaves, ere yet they drop, or sail, Slow circling, on the damp and mournful gale. NOVEMBER IN AQUARIUS. November, entering, bids Aquarius bear His winds, and weltering rains thro' gloomy air; Chill, with dense fogs, the cheerless, tardy morn, Wrap soon-invading night in pall forlorn, And till December, and his train appear, Pour the loud urn on the expiring Year. DECEMBER IN PISCES. He comes!—his deadly signals round her rise, The naked branches, and the sunless skies; Holds in his livid hands, a scaly pair, Voiceless and dull, the types of her despair. 'Mid snows, that shroud the hard and ridgy land, Stern, by his side, see blasting Silence stand; Stretch widely her petrific wand, of force To arrest the floods upon their eddying course!— The Year beholds, and with the last dismay, Her wither's honours, and exhausted sway. Mute all her streams!—no sound,—no motion cheers, Each naked forest stands a pile of spears! And now, amid the wreck of all she gave, Shuddering she sinks in the oblivious grave. INSCRIBED ON THE BACK OF A LANDSCAPE, DRAWN BY THE REV. WILLIAM BREE OF COLESHILL, IN WARWICKSHIRE. Here, from the hand of Genius, meets your eye The tangled foliage of a shadowy dell; Meets it in Nature's truth;—and see, the brook Thro' yon wild thicket work its way oblique, Hurrying and dashing thro' the lonely wood! INSCRIBED ON THE BACK OF THE COMPANION LANDSCAPE. From the same vivid pencil, now appear The social comforts;—Love them, as they rise On the soft confines of a scene sublime! Look up the right-hand glade; it surely leads To the embosom'd village. Snowy white The raiment see, which cleanliness prepares Against the Sabbath morn. The good old horse, Mark him, he drags, with weary neck, the cart Bearing to yonder mill the bags, well fill'd With life's best nutriment. The mill-house mark, Standing on the steep verge of the same brook, Which late we saw laborious work its way Over rough stones, and crags, and roots of trees, Roaming the wood-wild solitude;—but now Bright it emerges to the haunts of men, To light, to usefulness.—Observe the mill Dash the white waters from its clattering wheel! Hark! thro' the eye we hear it.—Cheering din, Thou break'st the mountain-silence merrily! INSCRIBED ON THE BACK OF A LANDSCAPE, COPIED FROM GLOVER, BY MISS FLEMING OF LICHFIELD. It is a golden view, the sunny glow Sleeps on the water!—Of unnumber'd tints Gorgeous, this bordering wood, with its proud oak, That lords it on the bank, have now put on The burnish'd livery of receding suns, Ere yet their fires grow pale. Pure, glassy stream, The forest, skirting to thine utmost edge, Curtains thee amply; while the far-off hill Lifts its grey, barren summit, faintly gleam'd. Look on the herd, how leisurely they pace, In social line, the narrow, bloomy lane Descending to the flood! Do you not see A luxury of quiet in their step, Congenial to the landscape?—farther on, In yonder little goats?—how calm they sit Close to the brink, and with declining head Muse on their watry image!—Then the boy, Heedfully following the full-udder'd train On his staid horse! while up the left-hand glade Streams the rich setting sun, and on his back And shoulders warmly plays. No child, I ween, Of fancy he; for sure his sober eye Marks little of the beauty he beholds; Yet we perceive a measureless content Sit on his sun-burnt cheek. Dale, to thy charms Pays or the poet's or the painter's mind A better homage?—'Tis a right good boy; He loves the brutes he follows;—they love him, And we will say he earns his supper well. ADDRESS TO THE RIVER IN A LANDSCAPE, BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN BY THE REV. WILLIAM BREE, AND IN THE POSSESSION OF THE REV. HENRY WHITE OF LICHFIELD. After a lonely course thro' yon deep woods, And the green quietness of distant vales, Now, gentle River, to the haunts of men The rude, stone arches, stretching o'er thy flood, Note thine approach;—and, as with silent course, Thou glidest under them, the staid old cow And lumpish horse above, are driven a-field By time-worn herdsman. Then, in swifter course, Thy lately tranquil streams, jocund and loud, Rush down the wier.—Again, soon calm'd, they flow, And the young day shines on their glassy train. So dost thou wander by the pleasant base Of a clean village, climbing up the steep And shrubby knoll; while, bosom'd in thick trees, The church the hill-top crowns.—The day is young; Clos'd yonder cottage door; the din and hum Of clamorous infants and laborious man, Unheard as yet; tho' from the chimney-tops The grey smoke, rising to the church-yard trees, Curls its light vapours round the boughs, and gives Promise of morning-meal.—Behold the cart, That late, well loaded, on thy pebbled bank Had creak'd and crept, at the yet silent mill Stopt; those kind stores resigning, which shall soon Employ thy loit'ring waters, and awake The clattering hubbub of the busy scene. Adown those rocky stairs, which to thy brink Lead from the hamlet cots, ere while shall step, With cleanly pail, light rocking on her head, The rustic maid, new risen; for she has seen Thro' lattice, curtain'd by the briar-rose, Her cow, slow pacing up thy left-hand bank, Intelligent of hour; the burden rich Duteous to yield;—and, yet more welcome, sees, Not far behind, the youth belov'd, from cops'd And hay-stack'd tenement, down in the vale. Yes, and thou soon shalt hear the tender vows Of true love breath'd; and breath'd in sweeter sound Than song of linnet, or the quiet tune Of thine own stream, when hush'd are all the woods. Mark that clos'd door, for it shall ope ere long; It is the good Dame's school;—and in shall creep, Like bees in spring-time to their dusky hive, The little troop, and in resembling hum Mutter the morning task;—but when yon tower Shall tell, far heard, the welcome tale of noon, Some striding, and some tumbling o'er the sill, The infant-tribe releas'd, with clamour loud, Shall totter down, and on thy shelving bank Shout, laugh, and squabble, strenuous while they hurl The frequent stone, dividing thy smooth waves. But on the morrow Sabbath-bells shall ring, And 'twixt the matin and the vesper hour, And at the rosy setting of the sun, That little, lawless multitude, which late, Noisy and wild, had clamour'd on thy brink, In Sunday vestment, and with sober gait, Walk by their parent's side, while from each hand The varied posies, dappled pink and rose, Woodbine, and fragrant southernwood and thyme, Scent the wide air. Leisure and quietness, Apparel clean, and vacant looks, all speak The sacred day of rest; and thou shalt bear, From that wood-mantled tower, the holy chimes, Silver'd and mellow'd on thy liquid course, To neighbouring farm, or cottage. There we trust Right welcome is the sound; more welcome still The Pastor's voice persuasive, when he speaks Of hopes eternal. Charitable deeds Shedding a daily beauty on his life That makes his doctrines saintly; while combin'd They form a picture, delicate of trait, Soft as the scene now mirror'd in thy breast; While the soft scene, and thou, its mirror clear, Are all the sweet creation of his hand Whose touch is genius, and whose life is love. Mr Bree's scenes are his own creation, since he seldom draws from Nature, and never from copies. TO MISS HONORA SMITH of LICHFIELD. This young creature plays every air she catches with full and elegant bass accompaniment, intuitively and spontaneously discovered;—also beautiful compositions intirely her own, and this without knowing the names of the notes or the keys.— Sept. 1803. She has within this month only, begun to learn music scientifically. WRITTEN JUNE 1800. Screen'd, dear Honora, by that icy veil Of virgin modesty, incessant worn, What playful wit, what plastic genius dwell Coy glancing sun-beams of thy April morn! Whate'er thy untaught harmonies impart From volant fingers to the answering wires; Or when thy slow strains melt upon the heart, Sweeping each varying chord, as taste inspires, At the creative wonders of thy hand Rapt sons of Science in amazement start, Listening the strains, that brilliant, soft, or grand, Rise at thy touch, and smile on baffled art. And when thy sportive fancies steal abroad, So wild, so new, grotesque, and strange they show, Not less we wonder at their cold abode, Such roses bursting from their sheet of snow! When filial love, by many a melting tear, Dropt on thy mother's breast, its force proclaims, Surprised we see an ardent heart appear, A little Hecla pouring forth its flames. Expanding, strength'ning, may thy mind retain Its powers, its worth, its latent fires thro' life! Priceless the blessing then which they shall gain; Who hail thee sister, daughter, friend, or wife. ADMONITION TO ROSILDA. Florio the wild, the frolic, and the loud, Of curb impatient and of outrage proud; Skill'd on the turf, familiar in the stews, Whose lawless senses not a vice refuse, But young and titled, amorous and gay, Deigns at thy feet his nuptial wreath to lay, Admir'd Rosilda!—ah, in time beware, Trust not thy peace to the resplendent snare, Nor from that man of errors hope to prove The faith and tenderness of wedded love! Thy fond attention, thy unswerving truth, Thy beauties, given in such a morn of youth, As fairly promises their rising sway A brighter noon and long-enduring day, While each auxiliar elegance combines, The wit that sparkles, and the sense that shines. These rare endowments!—ah, they all are vain, Habitual vices boast a stronger chain! Inured to change, change only can impart Exhaustless transport to the sensual heart. Blow not the bubble hope, that peerless charms May bind the wedded wanderer to thine arms, When soft attractions in a stranger face, The wanton glance, the gay, voluptuous grace, Venal, or libertine, his faith invade Who asks not virtue's or religion's aid! As soon expect, on yonder grassy height The new-fall'n drifts of April's winter'd night Lasting should prove, as when on Jura's side, A vast mountain in Switzerland. Their pure expanse may Summer suns deride! Lo! on our humbler mountains dawns the day, And the warm south-wind meets him on his way; Wide o'er their fleecy tops the sun shall glow, And where is then their dissoluble snow? A MARINE VIEW MORALIZED ADDRESSED TO MISS ANNE LLOYD OF DERBY. This Poem was written on request, in the year 1800, in the MS. volume of verses, collected by that young lady. Upon the page destined for these stanzas, a beautiful little sea-scene, with a light-house, and a small turret on the shore, had been previously drawn by her cousin, Miss J. Cheney of Langley. In tender light, and softly shadow'd round, Spreads yon smooth bay, with tall and lesser tower; The distant land, by domes and turrets crown'd, Gleams, yet almost eludes the visual power. That slender pinnace, with its folded sails, Seems o'er the glassy flood to glide serene, Heedless of altering skies, tempestuous gales, And future dread convulsions of the scene. Now let us moralize this pencil'd page; Perchance, dear maid, it shall admonish thee; Its traits may oft thy serious thoughts engage, The towers prove mystic, typical the sea! View'd as life's sea the calm and flattering wave; As Truth and Wisdom's strength the ampler tower. The light-house. Whose fires from wreck may human vessels save When Fate or Passion's whelming billows roar. Should, from yon lesser tower, the lamp of love Fling o'er the veering deep its roseate ray, Tho' not like those, the guardian fires, that prove Quenchless by storms, rage madly as they may, Yet, if with tender Hero's Alluding to the story of Hero and Leander in Ovid. watchful care Thou striv'st to shield it from tempestuous breath, May no congenial sorrow prompt thy tear, Nor hovering danger, nor untimely death! And be those far-off palaces and fanes A prosperous city, whence thy bark may bear Wealth, that used wisely, peace of mind obtains, Wealth, that pale indigence may smiling share! Then while, amid the rocks and shoals of time, The frail love-lighted lamp may gild thy way, From Wisdom's tower her fires shall stream sublime, And mark thy course to Realms of Nightless Day. TO CLARISSA. Sweet maid, who culturest in thy vernal prime Those plants that flourish 'mid the frosts of time, Long, with assiduous care, proceed to store A portion rich of wisdom's varied lore, Borne from thy native England's classic fane, Th' historian's record and the poet's strain; The moral pages, tracing to their source Each subtle passion on its erring course, And those blest leaves, which can their force controul, The sacred tome, that anchor of the soul! Thus when no more exterior blossoms rise, Nor love's gay torch shall kindle from those eyes, The fruits of knowledge, and its lights, will shame The fading florets, and th' uncertain flame; Attention, tenderness, respect ensure, Which given to merit, shall thro' life endure. A FAREWELL TO THE SEAT OF LADY ELEANOR BUTLER, AND MISS PONSONBY, IN LLANGOLLEN VALE, DENBIGHSHIRE. SEPTEMBER, 1802. O Cambrian Tempe! oft with transport hail'd, I leave thee now, as I did ever leave Thee, and thy peerless mistresses, with heart Where lively gratitude and fond regret For mastery strive, and still the mastery gain Alternate. Oft renew'd must be the strife When, far from this loved region, and from all That now its ancient witchery Since this poem was written, all the native romance of the river at this spot, has been destroyed by a detestable cotton-mill. revives; Revives, with spells more potent erst than knew Your white-rob'd Druids on their Deva's bank Aweful to frame; when the loud mystic song, And louder clang of their unnumber'd harps, Drown'd e'en the river's thunder, where she throws All, all her waters in one rocky chasm, Narrow, but fathomless, and goads them on Roaring and foaming, while Llangollen's steeps Rebellow to the noise. Ye, who now frame Your talismans resistless, O! receive, Ye mild Enchantresses, my warm adieu! Time, that for me hath pass'd full many a year On broad and withering pinion, may have quench'd By the rude wafture of his dusky wing, Fancy's clear fires;—Enthusiasm may waste In her own fruitless energies, and pine, Vainly may pine for the exhausted powers Of bankrupt language, bankrupt of the skill To please, with varied praise, the taste made coy By riot of encomium; but yet The benediction of increasing love, Bless'd pair, receive with no ungracious ear! When first your Eden in this hallow'd vale Stole on these eyes; its solemn graces first Imprest my senses, pliant to their wish, The muse of landscape came, and to my hand Her pallet, glowing in ideal hues, With smiles extended. Straight my doubtful pen Eager I dipt, and, not unfaithful, rose Some features of the scene. Yet, even then, In Friendship's primal hours, my soul perceiv'd Feelings, that more defied expression's power To speak them truly, than to paint the charms Of those distinguish'd bowers;—their mountains vast, Here pale and barren, and there dark with woods; Yon mural rocks, whose surface still defies All change of seasons, though they deign to yield, At intervals, their grey and wannish hue Purpling to orient suns, and catching oft The occidental amber; sylvan glades, Bright fields, and shadowy lawn, whose concave bound No beam of noon can pierce. Far to the left, Beyond those walks which the tall branching trees O'er-arching, darken; past the sunny field On whose warm breast they open, lo! the shed On mossy pillars propt, and its screen'd seat Beneath its slant, thatch'd roof: Ah! pause we there, For there we wander to the latest verge Of a lone clamouring brook, which down its slop'd And craggy channel struggles; for the stones, Pointed and huge, ceaseless impede and vex Its passage to the base of the rude mound That rises opposite this shelter'd seat, And instant rises. Dark the mound and rude, But not inflexible. Its rocky steep No longer spurns, as it had often spurn'd, The mountain shrubs and trees, when infant roots, O'er balanced by exterior boughs, possest No strength to penetrate that rocky steep, And wind its darkling fissures; till at length, Art, with unwearied hand, had form'd a shield Against the brook, that undermines when calm, When violent, tears; 'gainst the repellant cliff, And force it to receive in its rude breast Each stranger-scion;—so, with lucky skill, The guardian sisters wove their net-work firm With tough, yet pliant withy, from the base To flood-mark rising; upright and transverse Bars, crossing each the other, forming each Their vacant inch dividual. Therefore now Nor waters mine the root, nor tear the branch; Nor cliff, so late impenetrable, checks Th' insinuating fibres on their course, Their thousand arms diverging far and wide, And to the centre piercing; while the boughs Bend their green heads o'er the chaf'd brawling stream, Around the huge stones eddying; fearless now, Conscious of deep-struck root, e'en when thick rain, Heavy and loud, has, 'mid the tempest's roar, Fall'n vertical; and when the madden'd brook No longer meets from tranquil human eye The gaze contemplative. Appall'd we shrink From the tumultuous flood, that tumbles down Fearfully deep, and often hurling up The yeasty billow, while the tide below Thunders and groans. Remorseless in its rage, But quickly spent, while under calmer skies, Or 'mid the balmy drop of quiet rain, Shallow it rushes, and innoxious raves. Innoxious, said I? Pardon, clamorous brook! Thy general course, rage madly as thou may'st Beneath a storm'd horizon, kind is found And ministrant to man, for pass we yet A little way along thy turfy bank, And we shall view, well pleased, thy useful waves Leap o'er a clattering mill-wheel, high above In the brook's hilly channel, 'mid whose brakes, Thick and entangled, gleams the snowy foam. See, higher yet on the still rising slope, Another hub-bub tenement obtains Ability from this oft violent stream To yield the first, best nutriment we gain. Haste to the scene, benignant powers of life, Mild Lachesis, and gay Hygeia, haste, From day to day propitious!—on that bank, Mossy and canopied with gadding boughs, Spin firm the vital thread! and brim the cup With juice salubrious! breathing soft, the while, Dear Eleanora, and her Zara's name. CONSOLATION, ADDRESSED TO MR THOS. H?D, APRIL 1801, WITH A POCKET-BOOK. Accept this tribute, H?d, as the pledge Of my assured conviction that thy trust Ne'er had been stain'd by those imputed faults Which hurl'd thee from thy station, where yon towers, Gothic and grand, arise, diffusing far The blessings of their Lord. Where still subsists State, by swoln pride unstain'd; home-residence, Munificence, with ever-open gate; Ready supply to want; protection kind, As Chieftains to their clans in olden time When tenantry was filial. Haply now, V?, in thy domain is found, exempt From feudal vassalage, each feudal good. H?, 'twas lately thine those lofty halls Watchful to guard;—those fair and ample lawns Flank'd with their woods luxuriant; numerous fields Rich in the food of flocks and herds, that range A second Canaan; or, of higher use, Wave wide their bending gold in Ceres' smile. Yes; to protect them e'en with Argus' eyes, From menial riot, and the injurious arts, Servile and peculant, was thine;—to spread, With even hand, the delegated store Of liberal charity. Then didst thou rouse To daily action thy experienced skill; Talents commensurate to highest trust; Attachment warm, and all the energies That brave the winter storms, and scorn the suns Parching the plains at noon-tide; strenuous still Well to discharge thy duty. Ah, too well, For thine own safety, was that duty done! Less faithful service ill could brook the glance Piercing extortion's veil; nor would endure Thy voice of just reproof, nor the firm hand Curbing profusion. Then were form'd those wiles, That, woven round thy late confiding lord, And his ingenuous lady, by degrees, Disgraced thee in their trust; themselves all truth, Long deeming faithful those who very long Had bask'd in their bright rays, while thou to them Wert but a man of yesterday. And thus Those smiles benign, that cheered thee through thy months Of arduous designation, faded grown, Sunk, ere 'twas long, in that unpierc'd eclipse Suspicion gendered, which the kindling heart Suspected without cause, so seldom knows Patient to suffer. All the Briton woke, And, for an interval, Discretion lost Remembrance of that maxim, which enjoins The servant to submission, meek of eye, Of voice unmurmuring, howsoe'er accused Where real fault is none. So did'st hou rush Into the snare which Falsehood had prepared To banish whom it fear'd; make thee provoke The fate which Goodness, by delay, perchance Had learnt thou did'st not merit. Much I grieved Talents so rare, and energies so prompt, Should, through misdeeming, be forsaken found By thy thrice gracious lord. The deep, dark work Of evidence untrue, from Hate avow'd, And from dissembled Friendship; while the last, Assuming grief for errors well devised, Won thy abused master to belief. So sly Iago warp'd the noble Moor! So Zanga pitied leonora's guilt! 'Twas a black cloud burst o'er thee. For a time Thou stood'st like a young tree by lightning struck, Struck, but not blasted. Yet thy leaves did droop As they would wither. Soon the timely dew Of springing Hope revived them. In those hours Mark'd I the starting tear, by manly pride Dispersed or ere it fell; the quivering lip And the clear conscience which rebuked thy nerves, Steadying them quickly. Now the hour is come, Ample of recompence; th' illustrious house That nursed thy youth to virtue, and that gave, Resign'd thee rather to more arduous trust, Opes wide its sheltering gates, and reinstates Him whom it deems incapable of fraud, Or scarce less guilty negligence; since years Of faithfulness unswerving, had inspired Such confidence, as no delusive breath, Calumniating through interest, could destroy. Well knows thy generous young lord, that he, Whom his loved father, wise and good, had train'd, Trusted, and never found that trust betray'd, Could not at once apostatize, and rush On vices unhabitual, that must wrong His noble patron, while they madly rik'd Destruction to his own well-founded hopes. And that young lord, heir of his father's spirit, He is the day-spring which succeeds the storm That shook his forest-tree; his are the dews In whose kind balm its lately drooping leaves Smile on the sun!—And he is haply serv'd By one of proved fidelity, The head steward at B? whose heart No sting of envy feels, no jealous fears Illiberal; but who welcomes thy return With all a brother's gladness. Upright men Act ever thus, and love congenial worth. That strain was gratulant; yet, ah! the thought Is ever grievous, that his lord and thine, In youth's high noon, and in the rising hours Of life and fame, droops heart-struck o'er the tomb; Turns the impassion'd, recollecting eye, On a crush'd rose, and its soon-perish'd bud! Lamented fate! that he should inly pine In double deprivation; often steal Beneath the shadowy languish of the moon, Mourning his blasted hopes; a loved, lost wife, Fair as the spring when May's pellucid morns Crimson the orient; while no sparkling stream, Fresh from the rock, in those soft hours of prime, Was purer than her mind. She died!—yet still All was not lost!—An infant pledge of love, Sweet transcript of her mother's charms, a while Smiled consolation!—but O! second pang Scarcely less keen, when to the recent grave Of his soul's treasure, he resign'd her child! Yet, surely happiness is still in store For B?'s virtue, thus severely tried, When time has balm'd his wounds! in store for him Who loses not in grief's funereal gloom, The care of others' welfare!—O! for him May that coy flower of life blossom again, Twined with no spray ill-omen'd!—So desires Her heart, which oft has ponder'd and deplored The lurking cypress in his bridal wreath. Servant obliged, deserve his guardian love, Who, with a youthful Daniel's judgement weighs A charge improbable; who clears thy tame, Who gives thee back to fair prosperity And gratitude's superior bliss!—Be thine To serve him long and truly! To that end Oft pour thy secret soul to Heaven in prayer, Whose aiding grace, never implored in vain, When ask'd sincerely, shall direct thy ways; Shine on the zenith of thy life; illume Waning existence, and shall pour its light Into the dreary chambers of the grave; Confine of boundless bliss, or utter woe, As faith and virtue, or as scorn and sin Refine, or stain our being. Faithful thou First to thy God, from him receive the power Well to discharge thy debt to human worth. TO ROBERT HARPER, Esq. SENT TO HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE HE TOOK HIS BRIDE TO THEIR HOUSE IN LONDON. This evening's shade no mirth, no joy beguiles, Beneath that roof, fair Catherine's home so long; Grief, ill conceal'd, in forced and transient smiles, Sits on each heart, and falters on each tongue. Yes, Harper, e'en on thine;—since, if thy brow From Nature's hand its candid traits obtain'd, Thou hast an heart to feel for all who know, And love and lose the treasure thou hast gain'd. Long on your mutual fate, that every star Propitious to the weal of life may shine, Still shall my soul implore, when distant far From her, whose hand, and vows, and heart are thine, Oft as her form shall to my memory rise, And wake, with kindest wishes, selfish sighs. BALLAD IN THE ANCIENT SCOTCH DIALECT, AULD WILLIE'S FAREWELL, A Free-Booter, taken in a Border Battle, and condemned to be Executed. In those days of continual civil war amongst the separate clans, each party hanged their prisoners. This Ballad was sent to Mr Scott, editor of The Border Minstrelsy, who inserted it in the third volume of that popular work. In his letter to the author, he observed, that the stoutest antiquarian in Scotland could not, after perusing Auld Willie's Farewell, suspect that the writer had the misfortune to have been born south of the Tweed. Fareweel my ingle, Hearth. bleezing bright When the snell Bitter. storm's begun; My bouris Chamber. casements aw sae light, When glints the bonnie sun! Fareweel my deep glen, speck'd wi' sloe, O' tangled hazles full; Green leas and heathery heathy hills, where low My kine and glourin sulky bull. Fareweel my red deer, jutting proud, My rooks, o' murky wing! Farewell my wee birds, lilting singing loud, Aw in the merry Spring! Fareweel my sheep, that sprattle on, In a lang line, sae braw, handsome Or lie on cliffs, the rocks aboon, above Like late-left patch o' snaw. Fareweel my burn, that wimpling dimpling rins, My clattering brig o' yew! My scaly tribe, wi' gowden fins, Sae nimbly flickering twinkling through! Fareweel my boat, and lusty oars, That skelp dash wi' miekle spray! Fareweel my braes high banks on Tiviot shores, That cool the Simmer's day! Fareweel my neighbours, whase swift steed O'er Saxon bounds ha' scower'd, Soom'd swam drumlie turbid floods when moons were dead, And ilka each star was smoor'd! Maist dear for a' ye shared wi' me When scaith injury and prey did goad, And danger, like a wraith, spectre did flee Along the darksome road. Fareweel my winsome handsome wife, sae gay, Fu' fain frae hame to gang, Wi' spunky lads to geck romp and play, The flowrie haughs meadows among! Fareweel my gowk! cuckow thy warning note Then aft-times ca'ed aloud, Tho' o' the word that swal'd thy throat, Gude faith, I was na' proud. And pawky sly gowk, sae free that maid'st, Or e'er I hanged be, Would I might learn if true thou said'st When sae thou said'st to me! ADDRESSED TO THE REV. THOMAS SEDGEWICK WHALLEY, ON LEAVING HIS SEAT, MENDIP LODGE, IN SOMERSETSHIRE, OCT. 10TH, 1804. Farewell, my friend! who 'mid thy Alpine bowers, Hast sooth'd and cheer'd my soul, depress'd by woe! Thine many a potent spell to wing the hours, And in life's winter bid the spirit glow. Yes, e'en tho' sorrow aid the frost of time, To blight the forms of fancy as they rise, Till all of Great, of Lovely, of Sublime, Is view'd with tearful tho' admiring eyes. High on thy mountain-eminence I stand, Or range the lawny walk, that zones its brow, See vales, and woods, and lesser hills expand, As in a map, the verdant steeps below. Pledges of life, see villas throng'd acquire Sweet power to socialize the blooming plains; Pledges of Life Eternal, many a spire Turn to the orient sun their golden vanes. While yonder, stretching far its amber line, Dividing England from the Cambrian strand, Wide in the blush of morning glows the brine, Bristol Channel. Milton uses the word brine for the sea, “The air was calm, and on the level brine “Sleek Panope and all her sisters play'd.” Lycidas That bears our commerce to each distant land. These, seen from the full shades that crown thy hill, Or from thy gay Veranda's An Italian colonade roofed light arcade, With poignant transport must the bosom fill, If peace and joy its secret sense pervade. On me the various landscape shines in vain, Since the grave's iron slumber seals those eyes Now, that must never view thy bright domain, Or meet thy rays of genius as they rise; Each generous kindness, worth without alloy, Meet them, and blend with them congenial fires, O! in that thought, my sensible of joy Sinks in my breast, and ere it warms, expires. Nor yet the Tuscan splendours of thy walls, Where all of elegance and art unite To charm the eye, that vanish'd sense recalls;— No, not one spark of its extinguish'd light! But when I see thee, Friend, thus high upraised Above pale Envy's reach, on Fortune's shrine, And when my eyes have on those blessings gazed Which for thy heart the wreaths of comfort twine; When all her soften'd emanations live In the consoling sweetness of thy smiles, Then from thy joys my joyless hours receive Reflected peace, that transiently beguiles; Beguiles to sweet forgetfulness the grief, That dim in deprivation shrouds my heart; Mine, while life still is mine, be that relief A Friend's dear bliss now only can impart. Long be thy gentle consort the mild light, Shedding content o'er all thy waning days! And may they stretch with long protracted flight, And bear to Heaven thy grateful pious praise! And may Distemper's mist from thee and thine, Thy lovely Frances, and thy faithful wife, Fly, like the rain when Summer mornings shine, Nor stain with one pale cloud thy eve of life! Edwy, farewell! to Lichfield's darken'd grove, With aching heart, and rising sighs, I go, Yet bear a grateful spirit as I rove For all of thine which balm'd a cureless woe. THE GRAVE OF YOUTH. When life is hurried to untimely close In the years of crystal eyes and burnish'd hair, Dire are the thoughts of death;—eternal parting From all the precious soul's yet known delights, All she had clung to here;—from youth and hope, And the year's blossom'd April;—bounding strength, Which had out-leap'd the roes, when morning suns Yellowed their forest-glade;—from reaper's shout And cheerful swarm of populous towns;—from Time, Which tells of joys forepast, and promises The dear return of seasons, and the bliss Crowning a fruitful marriage;—from the stores Of well-engrafted knowledge;—from all utterance, Since, in the silent grave, no talk!—no music! No gay surprise, by unexpected good, Social, or individual!—no glad step Of welcome friend, with more intenseness listen'd Than warbled melody!—no father's council! No mother's smile!—no lover's whisper'd vow!— There nothing breathes save the insatiate worm, And nothing is but the drear altering corse, Resolving silently to shapeless dust In unpierc'd darkness and in blank oblivion. TO MRS SKERETT WRITTEN, NOV. 1805. Of gentle manners, and enlighten'd mind, Wert thou, Albinia, in thy youth's soft prime, When thrice 'twas ours, in converse free and kind, Short space to gild of swiftly-passing time. And with thy brother, Mr Mathias. to whose cultured youth The classic Fanes their radiant stores display'd, While warmth of heart, genius, and manly truth, Then, as through life, his ardent spirit sway'd. So once again, to blend the soul's clear stream! Charm'd would my sense that pleasing view discern, But hope is cold on the presented theme, And her dear hands a darken'd mirror turn. Yet, friends esteem'd, to memory oft ye rise, Bright from the past, as refluent pleasures cheer; Though ye no more may glad these mortal eyes. Far spent my day, and the long night is near! TO MISS CATHERINE MALLET. Yet two short days, my Catharine! then no more, Beneath our long-loved spires, thy graceful form Shall lightly glide, to cheer my languid hour With emanations sparkling, soft, and warm, Shed from the mind's rich stores; and with the charm Of language accurate, by habit taught Th' ideal train with happiest powers to arm, That rise in swift subservience to each thought, Whether with Reason's strength, or Fancy's radiance fraught. Now damp November's desolating gale Covers the brooks with shrunk and yellow leaves; His iron skies scowl on our darling vale, Nor aught from sway more stern the scene reprieves. Of thee, since Destiny my heart bereaves, Lone wintry sighs in unison ascend With the chill blast which faded Nature grieves. On me her griefs, but not her hopes attend; Spring shall return to her, when distant far my friend! No Expectation tells, with voice benign, That future years shall give her back to me! Thou may'st again behold these turrets shine, These bowers may spread, these meadows bloom for thee, But here no more wilt thou thine Anna see! Yet not for that shroud those mild eyes in gloom! She twines the cypress wreath, by Heaven's decree, For many a victim of the ruthless tomb; Set are her heart-dear orbs where no blest mornings come! For thee, loved maid, extracted be each thorn That lurks amid the roses of thy fate, Knowledge and Taste are thine, and bid thee scorn Each shaft of Envy, Falsehood, Pride, and Hate; For thou hast soar'd where they have never sat; Traced Genius in his sun-track; with rapt gaze, Adored bright Nature in her scenic state, And in thy morn of life, and riper day, Fed thy clear lamp of Faith from Truth's unclouded ray! Lichfield, Nov. 1805. IMPROMPTU, WRITTEN IN THE BLANK LEAVES OF MISS ANNA BURT'S REPOSITORY OF FRIENDSHIP. Before thine altar, Virtue, ever kneel The maid whose beauty charms the kindling heart! The maid, ordain'd Affection's power to feel, In Nature's truth and in the scorn of Art! Enchanting Anna, if aright I read, Stands in the level of that cordial prayer; Hers be the rosy and the amaranth wreath, Which Love and Friendship for the Good prepare! So may her years in placid currents flow, Gay as her smile, and radiant as her eye; Pure as her blush, where those soft colours glow Warm May diffuses in the orient sky! Live, gentle Nymph, to bless and to be blest, Tho' rare such lot in life's ambiguous maze; Transient, at least, be all that wounds thy breast Till melt thy finite in eternal days! ELEGY, WRITTEN AS FROM A FRENCH LADY, WHOSE HUSBAND HAD BEEN THREE YEARS PRISONER OF WAR AT LICHFIELD. Fled are the years Love should have call'd his own, Bearing my wasted youth they roll'd away; Dost thou conceive, my husband, how I moan Thro' the long, lonely, disappointed day? Night comes.—Ah! every instant, as it flies, Feeds my impatience to behold thee here.— Morning will soon relume the darken'd skies, But when shall my soul's morning re-appear? Each separated moment dost thou count With a regret solicitous as mine? Ruthless the foe who swells their vast amount, And bids thee in unransom'd bondage pine! For thee, I judge thee by myself, and know, Dear, hapless Exile! all thou must endure; The cheerless days, and every heart-sick woe That Liberty might chase, and Love should cure. Yet, O! when absence all my soul o'er-powers, Why does thy pen with-hold the only aid? When gales blow homeward from the hostile shores, Why are th' expected lines of Love delay'd? Question unwise!—Does not this heart require Trust in my husband's tenderness and truth? What else can slake the slow-consuming fire My peace that scorches, and that wastes my youth? Trust in his love my heart demands,—and, Oh! Another confidence blest power obtains, Rescuing my senses from severer woe, Than e'en this cruel banishment ordains; Reliance that kind Heaven preserves his life, His health from wasting by Disease's brands; That not to their restraints his faithful wife Owes her late baffled hopes and vacant hands. If she may judge his feelings by her own, And grateful Memory urges that she may, He numbers tear for tear, and groan for groan, Thro' the slow progress of the joyless day. With sweet remembrances my thrilling heart Full of the Past surrounds itself in vain; They rise!—they charm!—but soon, alas! impart, By sad comparison, increase of pain. No fond deception, nor yet Hope, nor Fear Arrest the pace of life-exhausting Time!— He might return!—one word, and he is here!— Ah! why are bonds for him who knows not crime? Fierce War ordains them!—Fiend of human kind!— Fetters and death one murder overtake; From thee the Guiltless no exemption find, Thy murder'd millions glut the vulture's beak! And from such fate remember, O my soul, Exile and bonds severe redemption prove; That thought drops sweetness in the bitter bowl Quaff'd to the dregs by long-divided love. Oft to my aid this consciousness I call, To close the eyes, which still have op'd to weep.— When Night and Sorrow spread their mingled pall, That thought distills th' oblivious balm of sleep. All things around me seem to expect him here; My Husband's favourite robe enfolds me still; Here have I rang'd the books he lov'd,—and there Placed the selected chair he us'd to fill. Again to be resum'd, if yielding Fate, At length, would give him back to love and me; Then should I see him there reclin'd sedate, Our darling children clinging round his knee! And lo! at yonder table where they stand!— Their glances o'er the map of England stray; Ah! on the too, too interesting land How bends thy Annise her intense survey! And now she smiles, and to her brother turns, Her finger placed on Lichfield!—there, she says, There is our dear, dear father!—O! how yearns My very soul to mark their ardent gaze! Frequent, this killing absence to beguile, Anxious I watch, as traits of thee arise, I see them playing in my Annise' smile, I meet them in thy Frederic's candid eyes. Their strengthen'd bloom, their much expanded mind Shall recompense my beauty's vanish'd trace; Yet thou wilt love me more, when thou shalt find Thy absence written on my faded face. Dearest, farewell!—tho' misery now be ours, Slow time will bring the re-uniting day, When Thou, and Joy, shall bless these lonely bowers, By sweet excess o'er-paying long delay! TO MISS MANSEL, OF TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE. Pure are the orient tints of early bloom, That o'er thy cheek, in soft suffusion, play; Bright are the streaming lustres, which illume The silent eloquence those eyes convey. So pure, so bright, as opening life aspires, Dear Isabella, be thy happy youth! And may thy soul's hereditary fires Guide thee indevious to the shrines of Truth, And set thy pleasures on a scale so high, That all which frolic Beauty's hope impels, Insidious Flattery's betraying joy, Intrigue's light page, and Dissipation's spells, Shall meet seduceless the undazzled gaze, That Nature's charms and Wisdom's page explores Beneath pale moons while classic Camus strays, And when red Morning blushes on his shores! So shall thy heart, which mild Affection fills, Be, when fierce Passion's fatal fervour glows, Cold as the summit of Helvetian hills When the sun strikes their unobeying snows. Then borne o'er each vain wish and idle care, By the mind's soaring and superior powers, Thy painless sighs shall be as vernal air, Thy tears as dews exhaling from the flowers. ADDRESS TO THE YOUNG ROSCIUS. Written after having seen him in five of his principal characters on the Lichfield Theatre, June 1807. E'en as the sun, beneath the Line, comes forth, Where no prelusive glimmerings warn the night, Strips her dense mantle from the sabled earth, And pours himself at once in floods of light, So on our eyes, young Day-Star, didst thou break, In dazzling effluence and resistless charm, Ere in thy soul those passions could awake That look'd, and breath'd, and lighten'd from thy form. We saw them, at thy magic call, appear, Tho' but till then to manhood only known; Yes, ere upon thy head the thirteenth year The violets of a primy Spring had strown. In all Expression's subtlest shades they came Thro' that Promethean glance, those varied tones, Love, Jealousy, and Horror, Rage, and Shame, Their hopes, their fears, their transports, and their groans. In thee, and in the scorn of gradual Art, Genius her proudest miracle began; Gave thee despotic empire o'er the heart, Long years ere growth and strength might stamp thee man. Beneath the crown upon that infant brow, The robe imperial on that fairy frame, Stream'd all which grace and grandeur can bestow, All which a monarch's dignity proclaim. Thy Proteus soul each garb of feeling wore, Fire in thine eye, and passion in thine air; And still became thee, and in equal power, Garlands of love, and laurel'd wreaths of war. Now thrice has Phœbus pass'd each duteous sign Since first thy talents met our wondering gaze; Still in augmenting lustre seen them shine, Still scorning, like himself, all borrow'd rays. Seen the expansion of thy fair renown, Thy powers, thy graces rising with thy years.— So bright thy morn, what splendours wait thy noon! What trains of light, eclipsing all thy peers! When Youth and Art's proud summit thou shalt gain, Passions that now are but illusive deem'd, Then shall their empire in thy heart attain, Then be what long, by miracle, they seem'd: And when they glow in all their genuine fire, Deeply are felt as gloriously pourtray'd, O! may they nought in actual life inspire That can thy virtue, or thy peace invade! Above pale Envy's reach, thy soaring fame Long may accordant multitudes attest! And prosp'rous Love, and pure Religion frame The shield impassive for thy youthful breast! And may advancing life for thee display The gems of knowledge, and of joy the flowers; Shine unobscur'd on thy consummate day, With softest sun-set gild thine evening hours. On wealth and rank while rolls Oblivion's stream, Thy memory o'er its whelming waves shall climb, For thy dear country shall record thy name, And bind thy splendant wreaths on the dark brow of Time. A FAVOURITE CAT'S DYING SOLILOQUY, ADDRESSED TO MRS PATTON OF LICHFIELD. Long years beheld me Patton's mansion grace, The gentlest, fondest of the feline race; Before her frisking thro' the garden glade, Or at her feet, in quiet slumber, laid; Prais'd for my glossy back, of tortoise streak, And the warm smoothness of my snowy neck; Soft paws, that sheath'd for her the clawing nail; The shining whisker, and meand'ring tail. Now feeble age each glazing eye-ball dims, And pain has stiffen'd these once supple limbs; Fate of eight lives the forfeit gasp obtains, And e'en the ninth creeps languid thro' my veins. Much, sure, of good the future has in store, When Lucy basks on Patton's hearth no more, In those blest climes where fishes oft forsake The winding river and the glassy lake; There as our silent-footed race behold The spots of crimson and the fins of gold, Venturing beyond the shielding waves to stray, They gasp on shelving banks, our easy prey; While birds unwing'd hop careless o'er the ground, And the plump mouse incessant trots around, Near wells of cream, which mortals never skim, Warm marum The affection of cats for marum and valerian is well known. They will beat down the stems, mat them with their feet, and roll upon them. creeping round their shallow brim; Where green valerian tufts, luxuriant spread, Cleanse the sleek hide, and form the fragrant bed. Yet, stern dispenser of the final blow, Before thou lay'st an aged Grimalkin low, Bend to her last request a gracious ear, Some days, some few short days to linger here! So, to the guardian of her earthly weal Shall softest purs these tender truths reveal: Ne'er shall thy now expiring Puss forget To thy kind cares her long-enduring debt; Nor shall the joys that painless realms decree, Efface the comforts once bestow'd by thee; To countless mice thy chicken bones preferr'd, Thy toast to golden fish and wingless bird: O'er marum border and valerian bed Thy Lucy shall decline her moping head; Sigh that she climbs no more, with grateful glee, Thy downy sofa and thy cradling knee; Nay, e'en by wells of cream shall sullen swear, Since Patton, her lov'd mistress, is not there. TO LITTLE CATHERINE HARPER, AGED THREE YEARS, PRESENTING HER WITH A BLUE SATTIN BONNET. My gift may suit thee, fairy fair, Thy dear blue eyes, thy flaxen hair. In this soft tint sweet violets glow, In this the early harebells blow; From their young hours stern Winter flies, And shines the sun in sapphire skies. Blue o'er smooth seas the halcyons skim; Minerva's eyes in azure swim; In plain cerulean Luna stands, When mild she looks on seas and lands. If sturdy Whigs desire to see The stubborn nymph, proud Liberty, The supple Tory looks askew, And crowns his forehead with true blue. Hope from the prism this colour chose, And blue her robe redundant flows. So, in the tissue of thy fate, This tint, so gay and fortunate, All prevalent, dear child, be seen To chase the pale forsaken green, The yellow tinge of jealousy, And every dim and dismal dye! And may this hue of summer skies, Of Wisdom's fair, enlight'ning eyes, Of vernal harebell's modest bloom, Of sea-born halcyon's little plume, Of Tory ribands, Luna's plain, The vest of Hope, the violet's stain, Still prove for thee, as years increase, Emblem of innocence and peace. INSCRIBED ON THE BLANK LEAVES OF THE POEM MADOC. Reader, if instant thy soul-lighted eyes Perceive the claims of Genius as they rise, Welcome this noblest effort of the Nine, To deck with epic wreath their English shrine, Since here they rose, to emulate, at length, The Mantuan sweetness, the Meonian strength, And our green vales and silver shores along, Pour'd Eden's grand, imperishable song. Again, in all their pomp, they strike the lyre, Rapid, and glowing with primeval fire; And in the Cambrian's lofty story twine Each human interest with each grace divine Of rapt Imagination, when she soars From common talents flat and glimmering shores, Her lamp t' illumine at that orbit prime, Whose fires are quenchless by the floods of time. Thus, for the glory of the nineteenth age, The Epic Muse awakes her sacred rage; In no false ornaments her numbers shine,— The diamonds sparkle genuine from the mine. What harmonies our captive ear engage! What living landscapes glow on every page! What characters, in Nature's force display'd, With coy Discrimination's subtlest aid, In Cimbric regions, and on Indian shores, Call to the Epic verse the Drama's powers! O! mark, the thoughts with truth and virtue beam, Shewing what God shall judge, and Christ redeem; The asbestos A vegetable substance, soft and pliant as muslin, and which fire cannot consume. robe which the chaste style arrays, Impassive shield from Envy's lurid blaze; Where simple, nervous as in early time, Where plaintive, touching, and where rais'd, sublime. If thou rememberest through how many a year Deaf as the grave was found the general ear To Verse, Paradise Lost, which, through the long period intervening between its first publication, in the author's life-time, and Addison's Essays upon it in the Spectator, met little public notice, while his equally beautiful lesser works, Lycidas, Comus, L'Allegro, and Il Penseroso, were scarcely known at all, till more than seventy years after his death. whose fame is now the nation's cause, With scarce one voice appellant from her laws; How long the owlish orb of general sight Found mist and darkness in excessive light; If conscious of each grandeur and each grace, The Poet's sun-track thy clear vision trace; If thy heart throb to see thy native land Once more the Muse's eminence command; And if thy spirit, o'er such glorious lays, Wait not for tardy precedents in praise,— Then, generous Reader, then, for Madoc claim. With voice anticipant, the palm of Fame; And on each leaf, in patriot pride, descry The bursting germs of immortality! Such minds, where never Envy's cloud appears, View Madoc buoyant on the tide of years, Float, like the song, which left the mortal maze For scenes “where angels tremble while they gaze,” And, touch'd alike by Genius' solar ray, Vanquish Oblivion, and maintain the day! TO F. N. C. MUNDY,Esq. ON HIS POEM, THE FALL OF NEEDWOOD FOREST. Poet of Needwood, much my heart approves This thy owed duty to his ravaged groves, The lost! the lovely!—who, in better days, View'd their each grace reflected in thy lays: “Needwood Forest,” one of the sweetest ocal poems in our language, of which Mr Mundy, in 1776, printed 500 copies for presents to his friends. He has resisted all solicitation to publish it at large; but such a beautiful work cannot die. It will be given to future times; so also will the Fall of Needwood. And O! when many a future age has pass'd, Rolling oblivious o'er his nameless waste, Its some-time beauties shall again revive, And in thy pictured strains for ever live. Come, pensive list'ning, ye once jocund throng, Whilome that roved those Forest Haunts along! Explored, with pleasure bright'ning in your air, Each coy, green labyrinth, and each turfy lair, Still, as in prime of youth, the wanton Spring Expanded to the sun her showery wing, And cliffs, illustrious in their golden bloom, Rose o'er the glades of light-besprinkled gloom. Nor absent ye, when Summer's fervid hours Dropt more luxuriant curtains on the bowers, And the vast oak's writhed arms, of dusky green, Shadow'd the dappled tenants of the scene; With rival elm, whose mossy trunk appears Out-numbering far the lonely eagle's years. Nor when the months consummate left their vales To suns less ardent, less benignant gales, And Autumn painted, with his tawny hand, The shrinking foliage; and, in colours bland, Streak'd the pale red with purple, faint and brief, And tipt with tarnish'd gold each trembling leaf. Nor e'en when Phœbus' steeds, no longer fleet, With mane dishevell'd, streaming to their feet, Struggling through clouds, th' hybernal solstice gain, Their necks bedropt with globes of freezing rain, And the loud tyrant of the dying year Stript other groves, made other forests sear; For Needwood to his sway disdain'd to yield, His polish'd umbrage an unfailing shield, Those numerous hollies on his breast and brow, That thrust their scarlet clusters through the snow, Or spread their glossy leaves to transient rays, The rebel glory of the icy days. Nor if, ere yet arisen, dim Morning heard Your light-heel'd coursers paw the dewy sward, When the sly prowler stole adown the wind, And hoped he left no tell-tale scent behind. Vain hope! your swift staunch hounds the scent began; To right and left their hurrying numbers ran, Till found the taint, in streaming files they hie, And in one shrill, continuous clamouring cry, To which th' accordant forest joyous rings, Hang on his rear while o'er the vale he springs; Dash through the rhymy glades, and round the hills, As when, receiving tribute brooks and rills, O'er flinty bed a river foams and roars, Loud and impatient of meandering shores, Or, deepen'd, shews the Sun his mirror'd face, Or zones with silver light the mountain's base. Now, come with Mundy, where the ruin lowers, He hymns the dirge of the devasted bowers! Echo his wailing o'er their fallen state, Whom centuries hail'd irregularly great! Come, execrate the edict that destroy'd, Leaving time-hallow'd Needwood bare and void! There fell Imagination's rural fane! Thence fled fair-shafted Dian's votive train; All which the bard entranced in forest sees, Satyrs and Fauns, and leaf-crown'd Dryades! Milton, in Comus, makes Naiades the plural of Naiad: “Amid the flowery-kirtled Naiades.” They fled, when Avarice, with rapacious frown, From Mercia's temples struck her sylvan crown. Yet, gentle Minstrel, they whose raptured ears Drank thy sweet song in the departed years, Saw oaken wreaths thy auburn brows entwine, The well-won meed at Needwood's shadowy shrine, Shall find thy Gratulation's vivid glow Match'd by the Requiem, in its mournful flow; The orb of Mundy's muse-illumined day Setting with rival, though with milder ray; Pleased, shall compare the evening with the noon, And feel, in equal power, the Cypress garland won. TO REMEMBRANCE. Remembrance, while thy precious beam Shines beauteous on my early life, How kind a refuge dost thou seem From worn Existence' present dream, Her weariness, her doubts and strife! Dim are the mists that Time has thrown On years which fled so fast away; But, in thy humid lustre gone, They leave those years, for ever flown, To rise all lovely in thy ray. When June's red dawn had streak'd the plains, And bade the kindling Orient throw Her blushes on these Choral Fanes, They shone, in her slant rosy stains, Fairer than in the noontide glow. Then with what fond delight I hail'd The dawn, which must those eyes unclose That o'er my destiny prevail'd, Each joy increas'd, each grief repell'd, Which in my youthful bosom rose! E'en to exist was ecstacy, To feel the sun, to breathe the gale; Charm'd to expect, to hear, to see Friends, whose dear smiles were more to me Than all Peruvian mountains veil! More rosy than the morn of June Those happy days, now far removed; And sweeter than the linnet's tune, That gaily choir'd its liquid sun, The accents of the lips I loved! But Earth, deprived, no longer seems In fair ideal light to glow; Pale as the ice-incrusted streams Beneath the cold moon's trembling gleams, The brightest scene she now can show. E'en tho' the gay consummate year Reveal, in her luxuriant pride, All that her gorgeous livery wear, Hills, dales, and woods, reflected fair, In lake and river's glassy tide. Low in the chambers of the grave Stretch'd are those forms, in iron sleep, Who to these scenes their magic gave; Whom vows, nor tears, nor prayers could save, All, all I loved, and all I weep! Where, Lichfield, the unrivall'd sway Brave Andre See Major André's beautiful letters, prefixed to the Monody on his disastrous fate. once assign'd to thee? He bade thee thy spired head display Amid thy vales, and proudly say,— I am, and there is none but me! Enchantress, broken is thy spell, Snapt thy charm'd wand, eclips'd thy star; And to the dark and narrow cell The Spirit points, here wont to dwell, And spread his purple beams afar. Yes, the fair Spirit of delight, So long who made these bowers his home! Now sad he folds his pinions bright, And, pondering the sepulchral blight, Sits mute and sorrowing on the tomb; Griev'd while I rove each well-known street, And, with faint step, the fields explore; Lost, lost the vital hope to greet The friends, whom there I used to meet, And whom, alas! I meet no more. No more, Honora, shall I see Thy speaking eyes, that cheer'd my soul! Saville, the gates of harmony Eternally were closed to me, When thou didst pass the Mortal Goal! No due return of months and years Shall bring you, ever-loved, again; Mine are feign'd smiles and genuine tears, The darken'd hopes, the torpid fears, And all Privation's lonely pain. Yet O! since Death's avoidless hour, Remembrance! may extinguish thee, Beyond the grave disarm thy power Terrestrial blessings to restore, Which shone the mind's soft sun to me. Lest that should be, with all its gloom, Life will I cherish to the last, And grateful for its day of bloom, Turn from the shadow of the tomb, To muse and to recall the past.
