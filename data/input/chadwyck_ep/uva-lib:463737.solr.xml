      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE and his singuler good Lord &amp; Patron, Edvvard De Vere, Earle of Oxenforde, Uicount Bulbeck, Lord of Escales and Badlesmére, and Lord great Chamberlayne of England, Antony Munday wisheth in this world a triumphant tranquillitie, with continuall increase of Honorable Dignitie, and after this life, a Crown of euerlasting felicitie, in the eternall Hierarchie. VERO NIHIL VERIVS This poem accompanies a coat of arms whose motto is used as the poem's title. A happy race God graunt the woorthy wight, to whom this Creast of honnor dooth pertain: To liue in ioy, vnto his harts delight, and after death among the Saints to reign. The Authors Commendation of the Right Honorable Earle of Oxenford. E xcept I should in freendship seeme ingrate, D enying duty, where to I am bound: W ith letting slip your Honnors woorthy state, A t all assayes, which I haue Noble found. R ight well I might refrayne to handle pen: D enouncing aye the company of men. D own dire despayre, let courage come in place, E xalt his fame whom Honnor dooth imbrace. V ertue hath aye adornd your valiant hart, E xampled by your deeds of lasting fame: R egarding such as take God Mars his parte, E che where by proofe, in Honnor and in name. E che one dooth knowe no fables I expresse, A s though I should encroche for priuate gayne: R egard you may (at pleasure) I confesse, L etting that passe, I vouch to dread no paine. E che where, gainst such as can my faith distaine. O r once can say, he deales with flatterye: F orging his tales to please the fantasye. O f mine intent your Honnor iudge I craue, X ephirus blowe your Fame to Orient skyes: E xtoll I pray this valiant Brittayne braue, N ot seeming once Bellona to despise. F or valliantnes beholde young Cæsar heere, O r Hanniball loe Hercules in place: R ing foorth (I say) his Fame both farre and neere, D out not to say, De Vere will foes deface. Verses written by the Author vpon his Lords Posey. VERO NIHIL VERIVS. V ertue displayes the trueth in euery cause, E che vaine attempt her puisance dooth disprooue: R epelling falsehood, that dooth seek eche clause, O f dire debate Dame Trueth for to remooue. N othing vvee say that truer is then trueth, I t follie is against the streame to striue: H ard is the hap that vnto such ensueth, I n vain respects the trueth for to depriue, L et such take heed for folly dooth them driue. V aunt not to much of thy vainglorious state, E steeme the trueth for shee vvil guide thee right: R efrain alvvay to trust to fickle fate, I n end shee fayles so simple is her might. V se tried trueth so shalt thou neuer fall: S vveet is the yoke that shall abridge thy thrall. FINIS. Cladius Hollyband, in the Commendation of his Schollers exersise: his Verses thus Englished. If thou wilt flye from diuers Uices vayne, And in this world abide in quiet stay: And with thine eyes perceiue a Mirrour plain: Of things conuenient for thy self eche day. Peruse this woork, where thou no dout shalt finde: A rule to keep thy state in stedfast kinde. For like a Torche it cleerely giueth light, Unto Dame Uertues famous Mansion place: Without acquaintaunce with the wicked wight, Which by no meanes such honor can purchase. This is the guyde of manners prooued playne: To teach thee flye the feare of farder payne. Dum spiro spero. C.H. Finis. Thomas Procter in Commendation of this Woork, and the Author therof. What, shall I speak, or shall I holde my peace? I knowe not wel which of them bothe were best If of my freend my pen in prayse should preace, Some would alledge of freendship I exprest. But sith his matters are so manifest. To speak my minde what shall I need to feare: Since good report his Woorks well woorthy are. If I should seeme hauing perusde the same, And see no cause why I should not commend: To let it passe I should deserue but shame, Beside displeasure of my loouing freend. I would be loth in either to offend. But to say trueth, bothe daungers to preuent: He well deserues because so well he ment. He showes how fraile our earthly Honor is, How soone our pleasures perish vnto nought: What daunger turnes to bale our worldly blisse, By elder Age which haue such frailtie sought. At length how Death eche state to earth hath brought. The hautyest hart that vaunts of Uictors force: His direfull dart vnbreaths without remorce. The Wise whose wit inferiour vnto none, Through his abuse bewayles his follyes fall: The Ualliant yeelds, and conquerd makes his mone, The Rich complaines to minde his fault to call, By these estats he seemes to warne vs all. Lest through our Wit, our Strength and Riches store: We vainly vaunt, and last their losse deplore. Of pamperd Pride, of Enuye and of Wrath, Of lothsome Lust and filthie Gluttony: Of Couetousnes and sluggish Sloth he hath, Prescribde the shame and greefe that comes therby. Last biddeth vs such shamelesse sins to fly. For feare as those who haue them selues abusde: Wee waile to late their warnings good refusde. Some of these Men were Kings, Dukes, Earles and Lords, Some woorthy Knights some learned Iudges weare: But what of that? no fauour Death affordes, Hee striketh vs vncertain when or wheare. Hee vnregardes of what estate wee are. As soone the King that rules the regall Crown, Yeelds vnto him as dooth the siely Clown. And piercst with Death wherto wee all shall yeeld, Their shameless sins with sorow they bemone: Whome neither VVit nor force of Mars his sheeld, Can sauegarde them through their abuse orethrone, Ne Worldly VVelth may proffit any one. Nor earthly ioyes wherin they seemd to trust. Auailes a whit to help their sutes vniust. Of Elder Age hee showes the frail estate, Who in their liues Inferiours were to sin: Besides hee dooth vnto vs all relate, A perfect path for vs to walk therin, And to amend hee wils vs to begin. For at the length eche one account shall giue: If one the Earth hee wel or il did liue. Hee wel deserues because hee sought so wel. To publish that might teach vs what wee are: And took in hand our Elders liues to tel, Whose shameles sinnes might warne vs to beware. And by their fall wils vs to haue a care. Wherfore let mee your Uerdits wholely tel: And MVNDAY thank that vsde his Wit so wel. Nil melius arte. T P. T. N. in commendation of this vvoork. The Caruer often cuts from hard and craggie stone/ Some rare deuise &amp; curio? woork in hope to please ech one But some that look theron oft times at rend? talk/ When they them selues can hardly freme the like of r?der chalk So likewise he that p?d with pain this mirror for thy ease Is sure though some slow his pains that that some he shall displease. The woork it self no fables are but wouen from holy writ. Wherto he hath in Tragick wise some prety Stories knit. All which are doon for thy delight wherin he freendly showes: That lofty mindes are subiect sure vnto a thousand woes. Heerin he showes example wise/the guerdon due to Pride: To Treason/Murder/Lechery/and Couetousnes beside. Which if you shun or if it be thou feel some priuie prick: Then thank him who dooth wish thee wel though he do toutch the quick. And if thou know thy self for to be free from these/ Lend him good will as he deserues who seeks none to displease. Who though he haue not loomd so farre as finer wits could weaue it yet as it is vnto thy skil he is content to leaue it Allow his labour yet accept what he hath dun/ And thou shalt see the monthly steps that Munday meanes to run: And I his Freend and thine shall think as wel of thee/ As Mundayes woork dooth wel deserue accounted of to bee. Petit ardua Virtus. T N. Finis. E. K. Gentleman in commendation of the Author. The hart of man rightly ech gift should commend, that man vnto man for freendship dooth send. For so Christe him self left ensample behind, As Scripture dooth declare concerning such minde. The gift of the rich men Christe did reiect, But to the poore VViddowe hee gaue good respect. For shee of her need did offer mites twain, And they of their plenty, abundance and gain. Her minde was the cause that Christe did beholde, The smalnes of the gift and not handfuls of Golde. My goodwil therfore likewise must commend, The labours of any that to Vertue dooth tend. VVherin is contained things woorthy of sight, Heerin wel perfourmed and now brought to light. Ed. Knight. Finis. Mathew VVighthand in the behalf of his Freend Antony Munday. Svch vvoful vvights as vvayle the vvant of vvelth, And drovvnes their dayes in gulfs of gaping greefe: Such siely soules as scornes their holsome helth, To run a race deuoyd of rare releefe. Such vvilfull vvights that svvims in follies fond: And drovvnes their dayes in depth of dollours pond. Such simple Sots as sits in sullen seats, And skoules to shroud in seas of stayed state: Such mirthlesse mates as mouthes no sugred meats, But drencht in dole and drovvnd in dark debate. If such (I say) vvould once peruse this vvoork, They vvould denounce in lothed life to lurk. Eche fond attempt vvith greefe they vvould bemone, Eche heauy hap that hath them past of yore: And in this Glasse discerne their faults eche one, And frame their liues for to offend no more. Their Ancesters dooth them heer vvarning giue: In vvhat estate beseemes them best to liue. Then let my freend obtaine your good report, Since for his paynes he craues no other hire: His hope is good, that of the freendly sort. He shall receiue that vvhich he dooth require. I leaue you heere to iudge and say the best: So Munday shall obtayne his due behest. Ad huc Cœlum voluitur. M. VV. FINIS. William Hall in commendation of his Kinseman Antony Munday. Thy tender time to take such task in hand, Demonstrates playne thy zeale &amp; good intent: Which when I had at leysure ouer scand, And finding proof wherto thy minde was bent. I thought it good in mine vnskilfull verse: A Kinsemans looue in breefe for to rehearse. Yet lest some think that I affectly vse, My pen in praise thy deeds for to display: To wiser wits I leaue the same to chuse, And let them iudge if I doo rightly say. So shall I rid my hands of farther blame: And nerthelesse thou shalt obtaine thy fame. Vse time therfore as Wisdome shall direct, And take thy time as leysure shall admit: Lest in thine age Dame Science thee reiect, And so thy time with speedy foot dooth flit. Few woords and sweet, occasion bids me end: A thousand thanks I yeeld vnto my freend. Dum vires annique sinunt, tollerate laborem: Nam veniet tacito curua senectapede. Ouid. Respice finem. W H. Finis Thomas Spigurnel in praise of the Book and the Author. For all that Chaucer had great praise/ For penning verse which he did vse: By pratling pen his fame to raise/ And so to occupy his muse. Yet therin sure he did abuse, His muse, his minde and eke his wit: By leauing things that were more fit. My Freend heer paynfully hath pend, A Mirrour playne for vs to view: A Glasse wheron wee may depend, To see what mischeef dooth ensue, Of wickednes and eke the crue. Of such as do delight therin: And so their owne destruction win. The Historyes be sacred sure, And such as be moste woorthy prayse: For Uertue by them shall indure, And so cut of all wicked wayes, And so I leaue by pen to prayse, The fame of this moste woorthy Booke And eke the pains that Munday took. T S FINIS THE FIRST BOOKE OF THE Mirrour of Mutabilitie, rightly named, the Principall parte of the Mirrour for Magistrates. PRIDE. P RIDE is the root, from vvhence all vice dooth spring, R ich is that man, that can auoyd the same: I nfernall vvoes for guerdon it dooth bring, D eserued due to their perpetuall shame: E che one therfore regarde his verteous name. THE COMPLAINT OF King Nabuchodonozor, sometime King of Babilon, for the inordinate and excessive PRIDE, that he vsed in his life time. Caput. 1. On highest tipe of Honors lofty name, I some time did in Princely pomp remayne: Bothe farre and neer I bore the golden fame, And who but I in cheefe estate did reign? Till suddainly in all my peacocks plumes: I was throwen down for all my freating fumes. What so thou be that fayne wouldst knowe my name, And how I liu'd, attend vnto my tale: Nabuchodonozor, I am the very same, Who suddenly was turnd from blisse to bale. In Pride I rulde, and flaunted with the best: Who me denayd, by power I supprest. I am that King which did the Image frame, Wherto all men should treble homage giue: Those that rebeld should taste the scorching flame, This in my Pride I vsde while I did liue. Blood, blood, was all I dayly did desire: Such was the rule wherto I did aspire. When Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, To homage did my golden God disdayne: In flaming Fornace soone I did them throwe, Wherin I thought to woork their cruell payne. But of my will, see how I was deceiued: God by his might my puissant pomp bereued. His Angell did preserue them in the flame, So that they did no harme at all sustayne: No, not one hear did perish out of frame, This when I saw, did gorge me with disdayne. I thought my self inferiour vnto none: But I as God triumphant rulde alone. I thought eche wight was subiect vnto me, I thought it prayse to beare a loftie name: Pride rulde my hart, I could not Uertue see, Uice did abound my pleasure for to frame. A mortall man? no, no, a God and eke obayd: My whole estate in pamperd Pride I swayd. No one I thought that could my power suppresse, Much lesse I thought to finde my equall mate: With woordes I causde to bow bothe more and lesse, With hauty deeds I maintaynd still my state, This stomack stout disdaynd to stoupe all: This mightie minde no feare could once apall. But yet the Lord to make me feele his might, Bereft me cleane of mine Impeciall seat: For seuen yeeres space, my Pride for to requite, In shape of Oxe on ground he made me eat. A iust reward which I did well deserue: Since so I did disdayne his name to serue. Yet at the length his mercy tooke such place, That he restorde me to my Seat agayne: And where before I ran an vncouth race, With treble ioy my Crowne I did attayne. Now I perciu'ed God brought my state so lowe: And raysd me vp, that I my self might knowe. Beholde how gratious was the Lord to me, That liued long moste odious to beholde: See how at length his mercy set me free, And brought me home agayne into his folde, And though that I did run awhile astray: Loth was the Lord to see me cast away. You Potentates that rule in high degree, Remember how your state is heere vnsure: And though on Earth a while your bidings be, It is but lent, it dooth not aye indure. Think as to day your life you doo sustayne: To morrowe dead, the proofe heer of is playne. Think not to liue as Gods vpon the land, Remember still that Pride will haue a fall: Consider you are Subiect to Gods hand, And in a moment passe away you shall. Liue stil to dye, that you may redy be: When God shall call eche one in his degree. See how my Pride was quickly layd in dust, Beholde you may my Mutabilitie: My Princely rule wheron I whole did trust, Did naught auayle my state to fortifie. He set me vp, agayne, he brought me lowe: That I to you a warning plaine might showe. Remember diuers past in preter time, That haue receiu'd as sudden fall as I: And haue likewise offended in this crime, Now wisely looke, you like tread not awrye. Proud Lucifer fell down from Heauen hye: And all through Pride God did in him espye. Beware of Pride therfore my Brethern all, With your estates still holde your selues content. Pride, Pride, was only cause of my great fall, And for my Pride beholde how I was shent. Example take, be warned now by me: Let me suffise your pattern for to be. And to my graue with speed I haste agayne, Since I haue tolde that which I did desire: For now I hope that you will shun the payne, That comes through Pride, whose lew is lasting fire. And thus adieu, God graunt eche one may see: Unto his state, and so content to be. FINIS. ENVYE.

What, shall I speak? or shall I holde my peace? What shall I doo? all lothes my face to see: The more I muse, the more dooth woe increace, The more I shun, the more it followes me. My former deeds I wish recalld to be. But Uarlet fye, thou speakest to to late: For right reuenge is falne vpon thy pate. Why should I shun, or hide to showe my name? To all the world I am an open gaze: The infant young on Herod cryeth shame, So black Defame my name abroad dooth blaze: That to looke vp, oh how I stand in maze. To Heauen, no, cast down thy head to Hell: There is the place, where thou of right must dwel. But that all men may mirrour take by me, List to the tale that heer I will vnfolde: Heere warning take, let me your mirrour be, See how at length I trapped am in holde: You Gallants gay, take heed, be not to bolde, Least that you run to soone in Enuyes snare: And so be caught before you can beware. I Herod am, whose hart with greefe did gore, When Christe was borne, whom men their Sauiour call: I sent foorth Mages to foresee therfore, Which way I might procure him for my thrall: In hart I still desirde his finall fall. But God who sawe such Enuye in my brest: Did me bereaue of that I hoped best, Unto my hart it was an endles spight, That of the Ievves a King he nam'd should bee: O then (quoth I) if catch that wretch I might, All were mine owne, mine honor then were free, The pomp of all might then redound to me. But they in whome I fully fixt my trust: Returnd no more, their promise was vniust. I vowed to come with homage to this King, Dissembling then my ardent zeale of hart: Hoping that so I might him vnder bring, And by this drift fulfill my bloody part. But all in vayne, the more returnd my smart. And how I frye, and freat in spight therfore: Iudge you if one may any wayes doo more. Condemd I am to the infernall flame, For lothsome life which I would not preuent: Proud Pluto now torments my noble name, Now to to late I lothe my life lewd spent. Be warnd therfore, eche man keep him content. Clime not to high, for sudden comes the fall: Which leads you to an euerlasting thrall. You stately Kings that haue the charge in hand, To gouern those that doo them Subiects vow: Foresee by me such sinne for to withstand, Be not to proud, vnto your duties bow. Rememember you but Subiects are as now. I can instruct how other should deplore: But I my self could not take heed before. Call vnto minde the slaughter that I made, Of tender infants from their mothers brest: See how Dame Enuye led me by her shade, That mercilesse poore Sucklings I opprest. And through my Realme none could haue any rest. But what reuenge did light on me therfore: Is to well knowen, I need to speak no more. For suddenly I caught a bloody knife, Incenst with ire, to woorke mine owne decay: My Seruaunt would not let me spill my life, But he perforce constraynd my hand to stay. Els desperatly I meant my self to slay. But now at last, beholde a greater chaunge: Woe to reporte the matter is so straunge. A loathsome creature then I was to see, Upon my carckasse Uermin vile did eat: Such odious sauours did proceed from me, None could abide for to approche my Seat. For to beholde my body vermins meat. My freends and all, now suffered me to lye: My stinck was such, that none could come me nye. A iust reward for Enuye that I vsde, A mirrour playne for all that come behinde: To think how much my self I haue abusde, And altred cleane from out of natures kinde. A man, a beast, such doome was me assignde. And as I was, euen so I doo remayne: Til iudgement come, to quit me for my payne. Sufficient warning heere I haue you tolde, For to beware how like you doo offend: Now hence I must to troubles treble folde, Which will abide continuall without end. If therfore thou wilt to thy self be freend. Shun Enuyes snare, take heed of lofty minde: So neuer shalt thou wauer out of kinde. FINIS. VVRATH.

THE COMPLAINT of King Pharao, sometime King of Egipt, vvoorthily punnished of GOD, for his vvrathfull dealings tovvard the Children of Israel. Caput. 3. Am I that Pharao that did guyde, The noble Land of Egipt late? Am I that Pharao that did slyde, From happy helth, to wayling woe? And am I he, that sought eche way, For to subuert the Israels state? Then iustly is mine owne decay, Falne downe on me, for dooing so. I haue dese'ud the trueth to say, A thousand times as many moe. For all the Plagues that God me sent: Could not inforce me to repent. Ten seuerall Plagues God sent to me, Ere I would let his Children goe: With Frogs aud Lice moste straunge to see, To mooue my hardned hart with all: With diuers Plagues he payd me pat, For to reclaime my stoutnes so. But I esteemed not of that, I thought my state should neuer fall. I thought to beat all nations flat, Before that I would gayne the thrall. But who so fights agaynst the Lord: He speeds but bad, as I accord. I did perseuer in my thought, I did not force the Lord on hye: I thought my power should euer speed, And that his might I could deface: My hardned hart with VVrath was bent, I thought to mount vp to the Skye. But climing, see how I was shent, For down I fell in lothesome case. And now my deed I doo repent, For running such a wretched race. Beholde how heer I diue in paine: Yet can not dye though almoste slayne. The furious Fiends torment my ghoste, For pleasure vsed in my life: Trounst and turmoyld in freesing frost, Ye burnes this frost as whot a[illeg.] fire Thus doo I passe my dollye dayes, Amid a thousand heaps of strife: And from them can escape no wayes, To late it is for to retire. But iust desart (as all men sayes, Fell down on me in midst of ire. O loathed life, fayne would I dye: Cease Pharao, thou in vaine doost crye. Be warned now you Lordings all, Let Pharaos fall teach you beware: Spit foorth that griesly goring gall, Which makes you Enuyes seruile slaue: See Pharao, who of late inioyd, What hart could wish, deuoyd of care. And see, how now I am annoyd, Iudge if a guerdon right I haue. Because my time I aye imployd, To fancyes fond which I did craue. And now my pleasure spent before; With sowry sauce I doo deplore Say now you see a pattern playne, That you the like mischaunce may shun: See heere the lue of deep disdayne, That fostred was in Enuyes lap: Respect your state ere you begin, Now you yaur after steps may run, So shall you scape the sinck of sin: Which Pluto proud dooth round bewrap, When you espy another in: I think you may escape the trap. Say not but you haue warning had: Of one that feeles his state to bad. And thus adiew, I must return, As Gally slaue vuto my paine: To place where sily soules doo mourne, In lothsom lake of Enuy fell: I must not slack my seruice due. But with all speed must turne again, And there be locked fast in mue: Among a thousand feends of Hell, Take heed therfore, think on my lue: And of the place where I doo dwell. Then neuer wil you fall in this: But still take heed to doo a misse. FIMIS. LECHERYE.

THE COMPLAINT of King Dauid, (by Gods permission) annointed King of Israel, sorovvfully from the bottome of his hart, bemoning his vnbrideled Lust of Lecherye, committed vvith BERSABA the VVife of VRIAS, and for the procuring of her Husbands death, therby obtayning his purpose. Caput. 4. Did Adam fall for breaking Gods behest, From tipe of ioy to den of wayling woe? And did his fact deserue to be supprest? Then Dauids deed, deserueth treble so. Did Cayne offend when he his Brother slue, And was subornd from presence of Gods face? And if his fact did force his hart to rue, O Dauid, then thy deed deserues like case. What greater sinne then seeke the guiltlesse Blood? What greater shame then loathsome Lecherye? The World my fact hath open vnderstood, My cruell deed of lawlesse libertie. O Bersaba which so did blinde mine eyes. That I forgot my rule and Princely sway: Her seemely shape did force me to deuise, A thousand thoughts my purpose to assay. O when as thou didst laue thy body white, As in my windowe thee I did beholde: Me thought I saw a Gem of rare delight, A Phenix faire stampt out of beaten Golde. Then that I might my purpose bring about, On thy sweet shape to mittigate my payne: To bloody Warres I sent thy husband out, With giuing charge that there he should be slain. Then did I gayne my long desired trust, Thee Bersaba for to suffise my will: But I a wretch to deale with lawlesse Lust, Thee to defile, and husband thine to kill. O wicked deed, me thinks I still doo heare, Vrias blood for vengeaunce on me call: O mazed man, where was thy heauenly feare? What, didst thou think there was no God at all? O yes (my God) but sore deceiu'd was I, Before thy face so wretchedly to sinne: Thy mercy milde (O Lord) doo not deny, That yet I may thy dwellings enter in. O Bersaba, forgiuenes I doo craue, For that I wretch thy body did defile: Unlawfully desiring thee to haue, To spot thy name by such an vnkinde guyle. And thou Vrias through my deed was slayne, O where remaind the bounds of Princely sway: That for my Lust should so desire thy payne, And to thy foes vniustly thee betray. Thy dolefull death in hart I doo Lament, And sory am for this my wicked deed: Beholde (O Lord) my fact I doo repent, Whereon to think dooth make my hart to bleed. You Princes great that rule in regall state, Beholde how I did blindly run astray: And brought my self vnto destructions gate, But that my God redeemd me thence away. Take heed how you doo lawlesse looue require, Fly from such vice as from a Serpent vile: In feare of God your pleasures doo require, Then shall you not seduced be with guyle. Be warnd by me who am your preter past, See how I fell that neuer thought to fall: Gods mercy yet receiued me at last, And sorowing teares did make a mends for all. Direct your wayes as Iustice dooth beseeme, Assure you, then you can not walke a stray: And of this crime none can you guiltie deeme, Remember me, and thus I haste away. FINIS. GLVTTONY.

THE COMPLAINT of Diues for his Gluttony vsed in his life time: Caput. 5. Dround in the gulf of endlesse woes am I, A Glutton vile, moste odious to beholde: My life I led so lewdly out of frame, That all the World my presence doo despise. “And why, for that I might haue shund before: “But fond desire to that repugnant was. “I Lordly liued and fared of the best, “I like a Prince had all the World at wil: “To see the poore did gorge mee with disdaine. “I thought all much that went beside my mouth. “No, at my gate they should for hunger dye: “Ere I a whit would pity their estate. When Lazarus lay begging at my gate, I gaue great charge that none should him releeue: No not the crummes that from my table fel, To saue his life hee should them not obtain. The dogs to him more gentle was then I: They lickt his sores when els hee naught could get. And now beholde what haue I for my hire, An endles flame wherin I fry my hart: The helhounds stand and claw mee with their nailes, A thousand plagues I suffer in a day, And all not half so much as I deserue: Though ten times more they were adioynd to mee. Poore Lazarus that pining lay in colde, In Abrahams bosome free from harme remains: Where I had all the pleasure on the earth, And hee the woe, his ioyes are treble folde: My daintie diets now hath sauce ful sower, Now simple meat would serue for daintie fare. But hee they say, that wil no warning take, Deserueth wel to haue a like rewarde: And hee that makes a God vpon his drosse, Must buy it deer, as I alas haue doon: The pleasure that I had on earth before: Ful hard I now doo buy it to my cost. See what it is to trust in massy mark, See what it is to make a God of drosse: Beholde what gain returns vnto my share, for thinking that my life would alway last I am the wretch that did contemne the poore: but for contempt, beholde what did ensue. You Wordlings all that yet remain behinde, remember Diues drencht in deadly dole: See how desart ful rightly hath him sped, for lawlesse life deuoid of any grace. Who scornes at God, God sure wil scorne at him: Let him not trust that welth wil sauegarde bee. Wel since you haue my fatall fall beheld, I doubt not but you wil preuent the like: If so you doo, your pleasure may be more, If not, your woe shalbe as great as mine. But while you haue a space alotted you: Remember mee, and feare wil force you flye. And so Adieu, to Hel I must return, Where tristful torments trounse my caren corse: There must I liue, there must I neuer dye, O grisly greef that neuer wil haue end.

No greater plagues must be thy shameless share For lothed life which thou before didst vse, In crauing that which moste did the abuse.

I Iudas am that once Disciple was, To Christe that was my Lord and Maister deer; Beholde mee wretch that stands in presence heer. Who Traitour like his sorowes brought to passe. For beeing greedy of a golden gaine: For money put my Maister vnto paine. I am the Wretch that dipped in the dish, When as hee said, euen hee shall woork my woe: And see how I assented to doo so. For in the Garden with a traiterous kisse. I brought to passe how hee should Captiue bee; Led like a Lamb his slaughter for to see. I thirtie pence receiued for my deed, Which after warde when I recalld to minde: For my offence great wrath to mee assignde. Before the Preests I hasted then with speed, And threw the money in despight away: Confessing I the guiltlesse did betray. And foorth I went ashamed to showe my face, For stil my deed did gore mee to the hart: In that I had doon such a vilains parte. I could not rest nor bide in any place. But went and hangd my self vpon a tree: In place wheras all might mee plainly see. Then Belzabub began to play his parte, Hee came to fetch my sinful soule to hel: Where to to bad in torments I doo dwel. Without remorce as is my iust desart. Loe what an end my Auarice did gain: For preter ioyes, an after treble pain. Learne you therfore that see my greeuous fall, To flye from that which wil incurre your woe: If on your welth you set your pleasure so. Undoutedly to Sathan rest you thrall. From whome be sure you cannot start awrye, But in the lake of deadly dole shall lye. Take warning now from hart I you desire, Let Iudas stand a mirrour in your eyes; That Auarice in hart you may dispise. And not to hye abooue your reach aspire. For if you doo, your fall is straite at hand: Prepare before, seek therfore to withstand. And now I turn vnto my lasting paine, Desirous stil to end my lingring life: But stay a while, I must haue longer strife. Example take, to you I call again. Fly, flye I craue from presence of this vice, Who wil your woe a thousand wayes intice. FINIS. SLOTHE.

THE COMPLAINT OF Ionas for his slothfull slacking the commaundement of the Lord beeing sent to preach to the Niniuites. Caput. 7. Muse not my Freends though Ionas now, appeere before your face: I come to vtter foorth my crime, gainst Gods Almightie grace. For beeing straitly chargde by him, that I to Niniuie: Should goe and tel the People how, they liued in great miserye. I would not doo as I had charge, but went an other way: To Ioppa wher in secret sorte, to Tharsus I would stray. And finding hoyssed sayles at hand, and ready to depart: I entred ship not minding that, which was my cheefest part. So foorth wee launcht and vnder hatch, I went to take my rest: Desiring for to sleep my fil, for that did please mee best. But suddainly vnlooked for, a mightie storme did ryse: The anger of the God abooue, was threatned in the skyes. The ship was tossed wunderously. a greeuous sight to see: For death each man did then awayt, no way els might there bee. And stil the Maister plied his charge, to ease the heauy wait: Suspecting that should be the cause, wherwith the ship was frayght. So foorth hee cast his merchandise, into the swelling seas: When that was doon, yet nere the more, the tempest did appease. Then euery man fel on his knees, and loude to God did cry: Yet was the tempest terrible, and raged cruelly. Then vnder hatch the Maister came, where mee a sleep hee found: Awake quoth hee, and pray with vs, shun Sloth wee now are bound. Then to our prayers fel wee hard, yet all would not content: For stil it raged more and more, in vain their time was spent. At last the Maister thus gan say, my Freends if you agree: Wee lots wil cast which of vs all, procures this rage to bee. The Lots were their immediatly, deuided twixt vs all: And when each one had tooke his chaunce, the lot on mee did fall. Wel then (quoth I) since that this rage, procured is by mee: Into the seas doo cast mee strait, then all content shall bee. To which for sauegarde of their liues, they gladly did consent: But God though I offended had, would not my perishment. But present sent a mightie VVhale, when I was throwen in sea Within whose paunch free from all harm I did remain three dayes. And at the last deliuered was, this did my God for mee: So that by this the seas were calm and they escaped free. And though that I offended had, and slackt my duty so: God would not leaue mee succourlesse, but sheelded mee from wo. For when I called vnto minde. my great and lewd offence; The sighing sorowes from my hart, made speedy recompence. For God delighteth more to see, a sinner wayle his sin: Then hee should vengeance present or iudgment enter in. So for example you may see, my sin which was so sore: Gods mercy soone did mittigate, to make mee sin no more. You therfore that remain on earth, let this your minde suffise: Feare stil for to displease the Lord, be not to worldly wise. Fix stil your minde on heauenly things that neuer wil decay. The rest are but as shadowes heer, and soone wil passe away: What vantage is it for a man, to haue of riches store: And for to want the feare of God, which stil should be before. The more a man dooth fix his minde, vpon that filthy drosse: The more endamagde is his soule, vnto the vtter losse. For welth dooth pamper him so much, that God is clean forgot: And then at last vnto his pain, vpon him falls the lot. So that all good and verteous men, from company refuse him: And where before hee was esteemd, now they disdain to vse him. Then is hee throwen into the lake, of euerlasting pain: Whereas no fish shall rescue him, to cast him vp again. But shall among the damned soules, in endlesse torments dwel: Where weeping wayling dooth remain, euen to the pit of hel. Beare this in minde in all your woorks, before you doo begin: Remember God is merciful, and be afrayd to sin. Turne vnto God, and God to you, wil turn his cheerful face: Flye slauish Sloth, and then be sure, that God wil you imbrace. For idlenes is enemye, to goodnes as men say: Therfore doo shun the enemy, and one the Vertue stay. Let all that have you preter past, examples be to you, How you may learn in all assayes, vile sin for to eschew. And thus if you direct your wayes, you walk the path so right: That heauen is your inheritance, in foyle of Sathans spight. Anthony Munday. FINIS.

THE COMPLAINT of Absalon, for his vayne aspiring to the Imperiall Crovvn and Diademe of his Father King DAVID, and for his sudden fall he obtayned in his pretended purpose. Ca. 1. On whom the fates in lowring sorte did frown, I am the wight and Absalon by name: Wh? hauty hart (at last) perforce threw down Unto my woe, and thrise eternall shame. But he that seeks to clime beyond his reach: In end dooth fall, experience dooth me teach. So I for proof the sonne to Dauid king, Presumde imhart vnto my Father's place: A thousand woes I compast for this thing, And wisht as King his kingdome to imbrace. For stil desire did prick mee to the same: But duty said that I deserued blame. Wel what of that? let duty quake with colde, Let wanton wil prick foorth his lusty prime: My Fathers Age stil made mee very bolde, And stil mee thought hee liude to long a time. His hoary heares were far vnfit to guyde: So great a charge, this thought I in my pride. Wel at the last betide mee weale or woe, I would aduenture for this rare renown: By puisant force my might I ment to showe, So that therby I might attayne the crown. In spight of Sire, or doo what els hee could: His crown and realms obtain perforce I would. My Fathers force I naught esteeme (quoth I) I (present) wil erect a martiall hand: For either hee wil graunt, or els wil flye, Then Dauids seat comes pat into thy hand. O Absalon cheer vp thy noble hart. Proceed in this to play a Uictors part. Then lusty Lads I present did prepare, In steeled cotes to bring my pupose right: A mightie band I leuied for my share, Not doubting but to foyle my Fathers might. Both noyse of Drum, and clangering trumpet thril, Did prick mee foorth for to obtayne my wil. For what more fame vnto a hauty hart, Then to encounter with his mortall foe? What infamy obtaines hee that will start? And Cowardly like from out the skirmish goe. So euery houre I thought a yeer of twain: Til I by fight my Father crown did gain. Wel then at last with courage foorth I went, And all my traine for to perfourme the deed: At last wee came where conter force was bent, Gainst mee and mine for to resist with speed. With Cannon cracks the battail then began: Eche one to showe him self a martiall man. On each side then began the bloody blowes. Assault, assault the Captaines cry amain: The Ensignes spred the battels force for showes, The horsmen they the ranks haue broke in twain. the hurling shafts and fiery balles doo flye: With such a force as darkned is the skye. My men although they were the greater part, A number slaine, the rest began to faint: The other side are Uictors by desart, then dark annoy my courage did attaint. I had the wurst I thought it best to flye: Without I would before myne enmyes dye. Then fled I thence, and glad my life to saue, For God was angry with my vnkinde act: Considering I my Fathers crown did craue, And entred feeld, which was a bloody fact. For this my deed reuengement soone hee sent: to make mee knowe my hart was wicked bent. For in my flight my heare caught on a tree, Out of my saddle it did take mee quite: And there I hung most woful for to see, And could no way redresse my heauy plight. A guerdon iust thus fel vnto my share: Because against my Sire I would prepare. Then knew I wel my hainous great offence, Had brought mee to my due deserued hire: Which from the heauens was sent for recompence, Because so hye in hart I did aspire. Then wished I all were to doo again: Because as now I felt therof the pain. So long I hong in this my doleful pain, That Ioab did at last retire that way: When hee mee saw, incenst with ire amain, At mee hee ran perforce, and did mee slay. This sharp reuenge from heauen on mee fel: To teach mee gainst my Father to rebel. See gallant Brutes by mee a pattern plain, Of hauty hart aspiring to renown: Who did attempt my Fathers right to gain, And would haue robde him of his stately crown. But loe what guerdon dooth on mee betide: To pay mee home for my excessiue pride. Content your selues therfore with mean estate, Keep that which Iustice dooth to you allowe: Take heed by mee remember this my fate, Perforst the wrath of God on mee to bow.

THE COMPLAINT of Triphon for his crueltie committed against the yung King ANTIOCHVS, vvhome hee cruelly murdered as hee vvalked to disporte him, and for his cruel putting to death IONATHAS, and his tvvo Children, through vvhich hee crovvned himself King of ASIA. Caput.2. If loftie looks might gain immortall Fame, Or double dealing merit woorthy prayse: Then Triphon I by right deserue y? same, Because long time I sought it many waies But if that Vertue vaunteth for her fee: Defiance then is open come to mee. Promotion stil did prick my hart on hye, With whole desire to gain a Princes place: For by deceit I thought to mount the skye, But at the last deceit did mee deface. Deceit they say so long may vsed bee: That at the length his Maister shame wil hee. For so by mee the proof appeereth plain, When Alexander shrined was in graue: Antiochus his Sonne I did obtain: Thinking by him that I the Crown might haue. But Ionathas did make mee stil to doubt: Wherfore for him I brought a fetch about. When hee mee met with fortie thousand Men, A mightie hoast that made mee for to quake: A subtle shift to gloze that matter then, Dissembling I this drift did vnder take. And set my tung a philed phrase to frame: That no suspect there might be found of blame. I promised him ful many a gentle gift, So that at length his men hee sent away: I seeing I, so fine had playd this drift, This Ionathas for Prisoner I did stay. And at the last went out through Iuda Land: That they abroad my fame might vnderstand. To Simon who my prisoners Brother was, I message sent declaring that the cause: Why I retaind his Brother in this casse, Was for due det claimd by the Princes lawes. And if that hee would seek to set him free: His Children hee with speed should send to mee. Of Siluer eke an hundred talents more, To mee should come, els would I keep him stil: My wish was sent, of mony I had store, And eke his Children resting at my wil. Whome afterwarde to death I did commit: That so therby my purpose might fall fit. Then I of Asia was proclaimed King, This was the wish I looked for so long: But Fortune fel reuengement sharp did wring, And made mee for to sing an other song Demetrius Sonne Antiochus by name: Pursued mee fast to woork my open shame. And to my ships perforce made mee to flye, Els had I death sustayned at his hand: But ne the lesse on seas I wretch did dye, Deseruing wursse if that my fault were scand. But God this sharp reuenge on mee did take: A guerdon iust for treason I did make. Flye, Flye therfore take warning by my fall, Let this my deed take place within your brest: To make you flye the suddain sweetned gall, Which in the end prouoketh your vnrest. Fye on all treason, woe vnto the day: When first I sought this moste accursed way. Wel since I haue so slyly falne in snare, And haue to mee incurrde an endlesse pain: You gallant wights I wish you to beware, Betime, see you from wickednes refrayne. So of my woe for euer yon shall misse, And for my greef, shall reign in lasting blisse. FINIS. WICKEDNES.

THE COMPLAINT of King Achab King of Israel, for his wicked life led in IDOLATRIE and cruell Persecutions, and for sparing the life of the vvicked BENHADAB, King of Siria, vvhom GOD had deliuered into his hands only to put to death. Also for his procuring the poore NABOTH to be cruelly murdered, therby to get his Viniard, by the counsel of IEZABEL his Queene (vvhose blood the Dogs licked-vp on the ground) and also his ovvne blood, in the Battell fought at RAMOTH, according to the vvoord of the LORD. Caput. 3. Lasciuious life deserueth like rewarde, And disobedience must haue punishment: Where falshod rules y? trueth cannot be heard The rod must come to force them to repent. Where man disdaynes to stand of God in aw: Reuengement needs must come by Iustice law. Where Crueltie dooth harboure in the brest, And Rigor puts poore seely soules to paine: Where feare of God is vtterly supprest, And eke the minde addicted to disdaine. The sharpned swoord dooth hang abooue his head: If God so please, to strike him present dead. “For proofe wherof, I Achab may suffise, “Whose wayward wil from Wisdomes wayes was bent I lawlesse liued my God I did despise, In Idols I did fix my whole delight: That Iezabel whome I did take to Wife: Maintaind mee stil in this my lothsome life. For mine offence no raine for three yeeres space, Fel on the earth, all barren was and dry: So that by this a murrain came a pace, That man and beast a multitude did dye. The Prophet I Elia did disdain: Auouching hee was cause of all my pain. But moste of all, that wicked cursed King, Dispisde of God for wickednes of life: God did vouchsafe into my hands to bring, That so I might abridge him with my knife. But for because hee homage did to mee: I sau'd his life, and so did set him free. But yet alas poore silly Naboths death Puts mee in minde my vile and lewd desire: By wrongful meanes to stop his guiltlesse breth Procured vengeance on mee for my hire. His viniard I perforce would take away: So by these meanes poore Naboth I did slay. The Lord then sent his Prophet vnto mee, Who thus did say, for this thy wicked deed: In place wheras all men did plainly see, The Dogs on Naboths guiltlesse blood to feed: There shall they lick thy blood in self same case: Because thou didst all feare of God deface. When this I heard, because all men should say, That I was sory for my great offence: I sackcloth got and so began to pray, But this I faind, and glozed with pretence. And God who knew how I did glozings fain. Preparde a meane to pay mee for my pain. For as I sought how I might get again, The Cittie Ramoth which to mee was due: The Councel of Micheas did refrain, And followed those that false weare and vntrue. So there in fight an Arrow perced mee: Of which I dyed in my tranquilitie. Let now therfore this tristful tale of mee, Giue warning how you run likewise astray: Feare God and keep your selues in your degree, Follow the trueth, exile all fraude away. And think on mee that passed you before: To giue you warning that you sin no more. FINIS. RASHNES.

THE COMPLAINT of Iephtah sometime Iudge of Israel, for his so rash vovv, in the sacrifising of his Daughter, for the foyling of his enemyes. Caput. 4. The loftiest minde dooth catch the fall at length, The Wisest man is subiect to a stroke: The Champion stout y? va?teth in his strength Is forste at length his boasting to reuoke. All is but vayne to purchase mortall prayse: Which lasts awhile, and soone departs his wayes. Man dooth appoint, but God dooth all dispose, Euen so by me that sought vainglorious Fame: I vowde to God if I might foyle my foes, And to return as Uictor of the game. I vowed what thing did meet mee by the way: As sacrafice to him I ment to stay. Wel foorth I went, such good successe God gaue, That all my foes by force I did suppresse: I had the wish that I did wholely craue, I bare the name among bothe more and lesse. My vow I made remayned yet behinde: I little knew what thing I first should finde. Returning home with all my mightie train, My Daughter first in presence I did spye: A treble greef did agrauate my pain, My mirth was turnd to many a doleful cry: My hear I rent, and garments did deface: Twixt weale and woe I stood in doutful case. My promise made alas perfourmd must bee, For vnto God I firmely vowde the same: My Daughter eke brought treble woe to mee. That I on her my sacrafise should frame. No remedy but death shee must sustaine: And vnto her this tale I tolde with pain. O Daughter deer which earst was cause of ioy, Unto thy Sire to blemish dark debate: Now art become (alas) his great annoy, In that thy death is wrought by lucklesse fate, My rash attempt to purchase lasting prayse: Hath wrought the mean to end thy tranquil dayes. To God I vowed if I the feeld might win, What first I met, his sacrifise should be: My foes now foyld that would haue entred in, Beholde (my Deere) the lot dooth fall on thee. If I should seeke to saue thy tender life: My promise made would more procure my strife. What shall I say (alas) amazde I stand, My promise I must bring to full effect: Thy life therfore yeeld subiect to my hand, And be content this World for to reiect. The Maiden milde this answer made her Sire: Content to graunt to that he did require. Since you (O Father) haue supprest your foes, And since your vow dooth fall so right on mee: I yeeld my self to ease your after woes, I shall suffise your sacrifise to be. But for two Moneths to Desert I must wend: My state to mone before my life dooth end. The time expirde, the Mayden turnd agayne, Then offered I to God my Sacrifise: Thus my rash vow, returned to my payne, To hunt for praise, which did me moste despise. When Man wil make a vow without respect: It God offends, his soule it dooth detect. You yunger yeeres therfore be warnd by me, Unto your vowes alwayes haue good regard: Respect in time the daunger for to flee, Least vnto you doo happen like reward. Stil vow no more then well perfourme you may: And so be sure you cannot goe astray. FINIS. MAGNANIMITIE.

THE COMPLAINT of Sampson, for his fond declaring to his wife vvhere his cheefest strength vvas, vvhich made his eyes be pulled out by the Philistines. Caput 5. If I be he whose hauty hart and strength, Throughout the world extelled was by fame Suruey my life, peruse my deeds at length, And see how Women brought me vnto sh?e. For I bewraid my Riddle to my Wife: Which did procure to me a heauy strife. When as I set the Corne in fiery flame, The Philistines conuincst me through the deed: They bound me strait in hope to spoil my name, But yet the Lord did ayd me at a need. For nothing I esteemed of my bands: But valiantly broke them betweene my hands. Then Gaza gates on shoulders I did beare, Remoouing them vnto the Hebron hill: My might was such, of none I stood in feare, Til at the last through fondnes of my will. Unto my Wife my secret did bewray: And so by her obtayned my decay. I had example twise of her before, But yet (alas) no warning would suffise: If I had kept my self in Wisdomes lore, And her refraynd that did me so despise. I had not falne so soone into mishap: Nor ouerwhelmd with terrors tristfull trap. But now to late my folly I repent, And now I mone when as it is in vayne: When vnaduisde I sought my self to shent, And willing run vpon my bitter bayne. Wel may you say his payment he deser'ud: That saw his payn, &amp; would not haue it sweru'd. For twise the guyle I plainly did espye, When as she sayd, O Sampson now arise: The Philistines doo seeke to make thee dye, But quickly I preuented their deuise. Yet foolish man could not be warnd by this: But needs must tell wheras thy secret is. Her Sirens songs layd me a sleepe on lap, Then she from me my valiant force bereft: The Philistines then caught me in their trap, And then (alas) small comfort had I left. But that in God my trust I firmly heeld: Protesting him my Buckler and my Sheeld. They traitourlike mine eyes puld from my head, And in the Mill did vse me like a slaue: Beholde my Wife what courtesie she bred, See for my looue what recompence I haue. Now grinde poore wretch thy liuing for to get: To finde thee clothes, and also bread and meat. O seely Sampson now depriued of ioy, Where is the life that thou didst lead of yore? Is comfort turnd to direfull dark annoy, Is all thy fame now dead thou hadest before? Why? is it thou that burnt thy enmyes Corne? Beholde thy self (alas) thou art forlorne. Why, is it thou that shund the piercing pawes, Of Lion fierce that sought thy dire decay? And is it thou that rent his rauening iawes, And Honny hadst as thou wentst by the way? Looke on thy self (alas) to much vnwise: See how the world thine honor dooth despise. If with the Iaw of on poore siely Asse, So many men thou broughtest to the ground? Why then releeue this thine afflicted case, And haste thee strayt thy foes for to confound. Nay, stay awhile, thy folly first lament: Remember well how Wisdome hath thee shent. Would'st thou to feeld to fight against thy foes? O naked man, where is thy cheef defence? How canst thou now resist the battering blowes? Fye, Coward fye, goe shroud thy hot pretence. Think on the state thou didst inioy before: And sit thee down thy folly to deplore. Say, once thou hadst, that which thou now doost misse, Say, once thou wast free from all women kinde: Say, Sampson, once thou didst remain in blisse, And now reporte, O Sampson thou art blinde. Thou well mayst say, that once thou hadst the power: But now Dame Folly cleane hath cropt the floure. Goe cary Gaza gates vnto their place First take thy strength that brought them thence away: And then perhaps thou mayst thy foes deface, But til that time in thrall thou needs must stay. The scourging whip must teare thy tender skin: A guerdon iust which thou of right doost win. This is the thing the Philistines did craue, Thy thrall it is procures their iocond ioy: Since they haue got stout Sampson for their slaue, They him detaine their pleasure to imploy. And as a foole they vse thee at their Feast: With thy blinde sporte to frame some mery Iest. But yet one day as they did celebrate, Their Dagons Feast, I beeing then in place: To make them sporte, to God did yeeld my state, Desiring then I might them all deface. The house with olde, yung, great and small: I puld it down, so kild my self and all. Woe woorth Dalila that so wrought my shame, Woe woorth Dalila my vnconstant foe: Example take, let Sampsons bitter blame, Forewarne you how you trust to Women so. No more in secret to a Woman showe: Then you would haue that all the world should knowe. See heer stout Sampson valiant in his strength, Yet could he not a Loouers looke resist: For all his might, see how he fel at length, And forste to yeeld to Women as they list, Take heed by me, let Sampsons great mishap: Learne you beware to fall in such a trap. Ful many moe haue fallen in like case, And all through this, wherfore I warning giue: Remember Beautie beares a fickle face, And Beautie asks a treble cost to liue. You haue your choyse, which you wil take or leue Refuse the bad, the best you may receiue. FINIS SAPIENCE.

THE COMPLAINT of King Salomon King of Israel, for his inordinate looue borne to Outlandish VVomen, vvho brought him from the vvisest and richest King that euer vvas, to be cast out of Gods fauour, and to be euen in maner, like a stark foole. Caput. 6. Beholde (my freends) the wight whose fickle safe Through wanton wil procurde his wofull fall: See heer the man that thought his stedfast state Unlikely was to come in such a thrall. But wel ye see that Sinne deceiues the Wise: When fond conceits hath power to blinde his eyes. I Salomon whom God with Wisdome deckt, And worldly Welth wherof I had great store: Did think that sinne could neuer me infect, Because Dame Folly stil did stand before. And through the world blew foorth a golden blaze: That thousands came on Salomon to gaze. For when I had giuen sentence on the Childe, For whom two women stroue before my face: Such rare reporte went of my Iustice milde, That Salomon was knowen in euery place. Loe thus my God adornd mee frank and free: That all the World amazed stood at mee. Beside of welth I had the World at wil, To straunge it is to hear my large expence: Of golden gifts I aye enioyd my fil, My princely port, my Garders and defence. Were to to long to you for to recite: For all this welth did naught but blinde my sight. So that alas I cruelly transgrest, For fond delight intangled had my minde, Outlandish Dames did like my pleasure best, I clean forgot the wrath to mee assignde. Seuen hundred Queenes I Salomon did make: Of Concubines three hundred I did take. O wicked wretch, where was the feare of God, where was the wise foresights y? thou didst vse: what didst thou think there was no scorging rod That would correct thy hainous vile abuse. If so thou thought'st? why then y? didst but well: To liue so lewd, gainst duty to rebell. Why? did not God in dreame appeere to thee, And bad thee aske what best thy hart could craue? Did God not graunt thy wish perfourmd to be, And did permit that thou shouldst Wisdom haue? How thinkest thou? this canst thou not denay: How happens then thou wentest so astray. Alas, because thou didst not God regard, But in thy welth didst set thy whole delight: Eche wanton Dame with welth y? didst reward, This made thee fall in such a wofull plight. And where before thou wast esteemed wise: Now as a foole eche man dooth thee surmise. What wilt thou doo? thou sinned hast so sore, By kneeling down to Gods of stocks &amp; stones: That God will now respect thy case no more, Down on thy knees, sound foorth thy heauy gr?es Lament, lament (O wretch) thy wicked crime: Desire thy Lord to saue thy soule in time. You Potentates beholde my wofull fall, How wanton will hath throwen me in the dust: That now to sinne I rest a seruile thrall, Loe what reward obtaines vnlawfull Lust. My hainous faults recount before your eyes. And learne in time such vices to despise. Remember me that thought my self so wise, That I no way could gayne so great a fall: But when I did the feare of God despise, Ah wofull man, my comfort then was small. My trickling teares found fauour in Gods sight: And for my greef did yeeld me harts delight. So shall your liues be free from spotted blame, Your whole delight shalbe in feare of God: Then after death you gayne immortall fame, If so your liues be swayd with Wisdomes rod. Then shall you liue, and euermore be blest: Among the Saints in the eternall rest. FINIS. INCONTINENCYE. I f men respect their fickle date of time, N ovv in delight, then drovvnd in dark annoy.

Ca. 7. O Ammon fond, borne vnto great mishap, O lawlesse Lust that made thee doo the deed: O wicked wretch now throwen in terrors trap Where griesly gripes vpon thy carkasse feed. Fye on thee wretch, lothe for to showe thy face: Thy hainous act condems thee in eche place. Hadst thou the hart to woork such villany? No point of manhood did remaine in thee: So to dispoyle thy Sisters deere virginitie, A wicked wish desired for to be. No merueil though at sound of Ammons name: That all the world cryes on thee open shame. What art thou now? a man depriu'd of ioy, And subiect to a thousand heaps of woes: Thy pleasures past is sunk in dire annoy, Beholde thy fate how froward still it goes. Thy deed is more then is thy punnishment: Yet wicked wretch thou canst not be content. But moste of all when thou the deed hadst doone, And gotten that which thou didst wholy craue: Then in despite her presence thou didst shun, And thought great scorne her company to haue. O hardned hart yfraught with mallice fell: So gainst all law thy Sister to compell. O Thamar, I my wicked deed lament, I sorowe sore for my vnkinde offence: Deserued doome, full right my state hath shent, And for my deed, beholde my recompence. A iust reward, since so I did neglect: My duty bound to God in eche respect. For as I sat in midst of mirth of ioy, At Banquet with my Brother Absalon: Not thinking to receiue so great annoy, With bloody blade he killed me annon. Loe what a guerdon did befall to me: That so from natures law did disagree. If I had rulde my self in Reasons law, And framde my life vnto a good intent: Or if I had of God remaind in awe, Then had not I my time to vaynly spent. But where self will is suffered so at large: Great is the paynes that after will him charge. For idle life procures this lawlesse Lust, And idlenes is foe to Learnings lore: Where wanteth faith, hope and assured trust, There Sathan still hath libertye the more. And Sathan aye dooth forward frame the will: To that which would bothe soule and body spill. Therfore of Ammon heer a warning take, Learne in your youth to walke in vertues waies: Least sinne in age your pleasant ioy dooth slake, And so forget bothe God and blisfull dayes. Remember God, alwayes set him before: And your affayres shall better speed the more. Then vaine desire can neuer you assault, Nor no such sinne as I wretch did commit: Be warnd therfore by this my present fault, And shun such drifts as dooth no Christian fit.

Caput. 8. Although my deed dooth well demerit blame, My stately Pride and hautines of hart: Although my life so farre spent out of frame, Needs no reporte for such a vitious part. Yet that world may warning take by me: Ile tell my tale that all my life may see. And when you haue perusde my life at large, My mallice bent against my Fathers state: How blinde ambition did me ouercharge, With peeuish Pride (alas) vnfortunate. Reporte that I did well deserve my fall. In running headlong into such a thrall. I Adonia Sonne to Dauid King, Perceiuing age bedewe my Fathers state: By sundry sleights I sought about to bring, Presumpteously to pearch to be his mate. I thought his yeeres were so farre gone &amp; spent: that well I might presume to my intent. O what renown did I in pride suppose, To be a King and beare the souereign sway: By force of Armes to irritate my foes, By woords to cause my Subiects to obay. No life me thought in all the world more fit: Then princely pomp in regall throne to sit. It did me good to heare the braue reporte Of boldened brests indued with valiancy: Who trye their fate in mightie Mars his Court, Protesting faith to Magnanimitie. On carued Creast to shake the shiuering Launce: This valiant sporte their honors dooth aduaunce. This is the way to win them rare renown, This is the ioy that cheeres a Princes hart: This is the way to vaunt on Honors crown, And lasting Fame dooth quit them with desart. O valiant youthes, welfare your plied paines: Whose happy helths are valiant Uictors gaines. Well in this minde so farre I did proceed, That I had got such as would take my parte: Abiathar and Ioab bothe indeed, Did give consent to my presumpteous hart. A feast I made, where many did resorte: Wishing me King as woords did make reporte. O gallant ioy to heare so many say. With valiant voyce erected to the skyes: God saue our King, our woorthy Adonia, O wished pray so gladsome to mine eyes. But when my Father of my deed did knowe: My loftie pride was quickly laid full lowe. Those which before had called me their King, Left me alone, they durst it not auouch: O straunge euent to see such sorrowes spring, So soone a king, and made to soone to couch: Dame Iustice scornd that I should mount so hye: And threw me down in twinckling of an eye. With that I fled and hid my self for feare, To see what tidings would approche of this: Then Salomon for to preuent this geare, Was crowned King in moste triumphant blisse. At last of him my pardon I did gayne: So that I would in quietnes remayne. Yet wicked wretch through loftiness of minde, I could not holde my self with state content: But once more would reuert to former kinde, Aspiring still my purpose to attempt. And for to bring my matter more aboute: This prettye shift on sudden I found out. I sought to haue Abisag fayre to wife, Which when my Brother Salomon did spye: I could not keepe my self in quiet life, But still I sought to pearch my head on hye. Deserued death for pride I did attayne: So all my pomp on sudden did distayne. Now Lordings see my proud presumpteous hart, What liew I gaynd in recompence for all: See Iustice scornd at my vnlawfull part, And from the top did headlong make me fall, I which was Sonne vnto a famous King: By pamperd pride my ruin great did bring. ?Crussder trueth? will have her rightfull place, Her touchstone tries &amp; sounds eche mans intent: Though for a while Uaine glory her deface, Yet at the length her foes she will preuent. For Falshode dooth a while holde on her glose: But trueth at length her dealings will disclose. Now what auailes my loftines of minde, My princely pomp in midst of all my flowers: My hauty hart which made my sences blinde, And made me seeke to rule in Kingly bowers. What, haue I gaind immortall fame therby: Or such renown to pearch the azured skye? O no my freends, small honor is my share, Small is the fame that will redound to me: Shame is my due for this my rechelesse care, My wicked life so lothesome for to see. Rebelling so gainst Natures stayed state: And seeking so to be my Fathers mate. What, didst thou think thy Father liu'd to long, And duty bad thee to cut of his dayes? And did obedience mooue thee offer wrong, To him whose life so many men did prayse. Or canst thou iudge Dame Wisdome did agree: That so thou shouldst vsurp his dignitie? Alas, no, no, thy duty bad thee seeke, To serue thy Sire with reuerence in eche place, To stand in awe, to showe thy self so meeke, In euery point Obedience to imbrace. How saist thou now, hast thou doone so or no? Alas my freends in life I thought not so. Remember me which past before your time, Remember how I fell from blisse to bale: Be mindefull still of my presumpteous crime, Which forced me to tell this tristfull tale. Respect the end before you doo begin: Feare to offend in such a greeuous sinne. Consider life is but a puffe of winde, And worldly pomp is but a brittle blaze: Your earthly drosse dooth naught but make you blinde while you abide within this mortall maze. Ful many sin, but fewe their liues repent: Nor think how soone their folly will them shent. Gods Iudgement stands to cut down lofty grafts As seeme to reach more then they can aspire: Though for a time you faine such cunning crafts, As well you think to gaine your whole desire. The end brings all, the proofe hath oft been seene: Pride hath his due, iudge what therof I meane. And thus I wish you well your liues to frame, In modest meane to keepe your selues content: Auoyd this vice, and so you shun the blame, Which dooth belong to such as it frequent. Let Adonia serue example due: For perfect proofe that this his text is true. FINIS. VAIN GLORY. V aunt not to much of that vvhich is but vayne, A nd beare in minde thy state is heer vnsure: I t is not vvelth that can abridge thy payne, N or loftie looks thy vvelfare can procure. G reeue not to see thy neighbour prosper vvell, L et blinde Ambition rule thy hart no more: O r seek not gainst the simple soule to svvell, R egard to haue discretion good before. Y our happy helth shall aye increase the more. THE COMPLAINT of King Ptolomye King of Egipt, for his vnnaturall crueltie vsed tovvard the Famous ALEXANDER, vvho vvas his Sonne in Lavv. Caput. 9. No greater foe, then greedynes of minde, No seruile life like to contemptuous pride: No greater sinne then willing to be blinde, No folly more then in vain hope to bide. What more deceit? then look thy Freend in face: And woork his death, in most vngentle case. For proof wherof I Ptolomye may serue, Whose hauty hart, and moste ambitious minde: Procured mee from Princely rule to swerue, And cruelly to stray from Natures kinde. Wherfore my tale let peirce the flinty hart: How like they fall in such vnlawful part. My Daughter fair that Cleopatra hight, To Alexander of illustrious fame: In nuptiall band contented I did plight, Til Enuie vile contempt did seek to frame. My greedy minde my honor soon let fall: That in the end I lost both fame and all. My former vow I wretch did clean reuoke, Of faithful freendship to my sonne in law: Now perching pride had quickly strook the stroke Gainst verteous life wherof I had no awe. But banishing all fauour from my hart: Did seek to frame a moste vnlawful part. My noble Sonne from Kingdome beeing gon, Whose absence wrought the more for my intent: I ruled at home and none but I alone, Now thought I good my Sonne for to preuent. And of his Kingdome clean him to bereaue: By traitrous deeds I purposde to deceiue. Then I likewise to all his Citties went, Wherin I left of armed men good store: That at such time as serude for mine intent, I might obtain that long I wisht before. Yet for his sake vnto his Citties all: I was receiude with Fame imperiall. More Traitour I that such a deed could frame, Considering that I was receiude so wel: And only hee did yeeld to mee such fame, Gainst whom I did vnkindly so rebel. Wel, looue nor fauour could my minde intreat: But enuiously I went about this feat. When as I had eche Cittie fair subdude, That on the seas did harbour there about: By other shifts my fetches I renude, And now I had an other plat drawen out. Demetrius I did ioyne in league with mee: And so to war til all consumde might bee. My Daughter fair I took from rightful mate, And to Demetrius did her giue againe: Then had I raysde a slaunder vp of hate, How Alexander sought to haue mee slaine. And so through this such enuie vile I bred: That Kingdomes twain I crowned on my hed. O braue delight as braue as beaten Golde, O happy life long looked for before: I droue my Sonne into Arabian holde, Wheras to make my honor larger more. His hed was sent as present vnto mee: Oh how I ioyd when I this sight did see. But yet this pomp to short a time did last, Within three dayes I dyed in greeuous case: What vauntage then when honor all was past, Did I obtaine in my new Kingly place. My sonnes deer blood for vengeance stil dooth cry: Gainst me a wretch that wrought this villany. You Noble harts see heere a pattern playne, Of painted Pride contemning verteous life: See heere a gulf of Enuye and Disdayne, A mortall foe that still procured strife. See heere the wight whose folly made him fall: In seeking that which did return his thrall. See what I gaynd for greedines of minde, See how the Lord did pay me for my payne: In that I went so farre from Natures kinde, As woork the meanes to cause my sonne be slayn. Whose guiltlesse death beholde I now lament: Desiring pardon for my life mispent, Learne now therfore like Enuy to eschew, Least that your selues doo fall into like snare, Dout not but you shall finde the end to true, Therfore in time I wish you to beware. So are you sure the daunger to preuent: Of such a sinne as I poore wretch am shent. FINIS. VANITIE. V ievv vvel the state of euery mortall VVight, A lthough they boast of Beauties beames so much: N ote hovv that Death dooth equall all aright, I n each degree hee spareth not to touch. T he VVise, the Foole, the King and Begger bace, I s all alike that commeth in his cloutch. E xcepteth none, hee takes in euery place. THE COMPLAINT of Iezabel Wife to King Achab, for her inforcing her Husband to all kinde of vvickednesse and Idolatree, &amp; causing the Prophets of the Lord to be slain, and procuring the guiltles death of Naboth shee beeing iustly therfore plagued of the Lord. Caput. 10. If Beautie be a thing of such respect, If hauty hart the Body doo adorn: Why did my shape and beautie mee detect? Why did my pride make mee somuch forlorne And if all these were Uertues in a Wife, Why did so soon my pleasure turn to strife? O no deer Dames these vaunts are worldly vain, These are the pomps wherin you glory so: This painted pride procures your after pain, Which you lament distrest in double wo. And why? because you did not seek before: A souerain salue to cure so vile a sore. But lo deer Dames to much you be deceiude, To much you trust to that which is vnsure: For peeuish pride your sences hath bereude, Which makes you think for aye you shall indure. O think not so, for beautie is but vain, To day a ioy, to morrow, pinching pain. Beholde by mee if beautie might haue boast, Or hauty hart to haue Dame Honors place: Beholde her heer who through each forrain Coast Knew not her Peer for loftie lookes in face. But now what dooth my mounting minde auaile So long on flote, that glad to strike my saile. I Iezabel, soometime King Achabs Wife, Disdaining God and Idols did obay: Surmounting in all viciousnes of life, And only Pride did force mee run astray. For Pride from God did force my wilful fall: That grace nor vertue I esteemd at all. But in a World of pranked pleasures gay, I flaunted foorth as much as hart could craue: I was the cause the Preests of God to slay, And Naboths death desired for to haue. Why who but I, so many fetches had: With subtle sleights to make my fancy glad. But what at length was my deserued due, From windowe down I fel and brake my neck: By prophecie which I approoued true, This hire I had that Uertue would detect. In cinders small my Body lay on ground: Trod so with Horse that little could be found. Now see what came to Iezabel at last, See what became of my alluring face: My Peacoks plumes down in the dust were cast, What guerdon did my loftie pride purchase. Beholde my deeds, and then beholde my fame: Beholde my life, and then beholde my shame. Now daintie Dames your Mirrour take by me, To warne you pull your hauty heads more lowe: Let me you learne your welfare to foresee, And teach you how more grauitie to showe. Let Modestie your outward vestures be: And Uertue deck you inward frank and free. Leaue of these braue and sundry flaunting sutes, Leaue of to wish for euery straunge deuise: Milde Modestie your statelines rebukes, She would not haue you goe so coy and nice. But prudently to guyde your dealings so: That in eche place with vertue you may goe. Now when I smart I can you warning giue, That you may shun the sorrowes which I haue: Now I confesse, that verteously to liue, By due desart dooth endles honor craue. Counsell once had is better suer then neuer: Feare God, and then thou shalt be crowned euer. FINIS. WILFVLNES. VV here men doo more respect their priuate gayne, I n vaine excesse, then VVisdomes stayed state: L ight to contemne, slovve to release their paine, F rom vvhom bothe helth and riches is ingrate. V sing them selues as belly Gods so rude, L eaning vpon the honor of their pelf: N ot scorning still themselues for to intrude, E che man to pole, for to inrich himself. S o slides from God to greater greefe renued. THE COMPLAINT of Zedekia sometime King of Iuda, for neglecting his vovved othe and faithfull promise made to King Nabuchodonozor, in suffering all sinne and vvickednes to abound in his Kingdome, beeing iustly plagued of GOD therfore. Caput. 11. Amid the rest giue Zedekia place, Iosias Sonne to tell his great mishap: Whom Folly fond so greeuous did deface As in my pomp depriu'de me at a clap. Such crooked chaunce that for a time did smile: But at the length displayd a hidden guyle. First was I King and ruled Iuda Land, In promise that I constant would remain: When as this Welth was brought into my hand I suffred sin to much to haue the raine. Gods woord was clean suppressed in the dust: The Preests and Rulers sind in filthy lust. The Chaldies then Ierusalem destroyd, The holy Temple burnd with flaming fire: My Soldiars all with terror were annoyd, I taken was, so did my sinnes require. My sonnes were slayne (O greefe) before my face: Mine eyes puld out in moste accursed case. Then captiue I to Babilon was led, In fettered chaines with direfull dole yfraught: My people poore with tirrany were fed, All long of sinne which I (alas) haue wrought. Thrise twentye yeeres and ten they bid the pain: Till Cirus came their freedome to obtaine. Loe thus I liu'd, loe thus I had my shame, A guerdon iust to counteruaile my hire: take heed therfore how you contemn Gods name, For your reward is euerlasting fire. My sinfull life, my death so voyd of grace: Let now suffise to warn you in eche place. Fewe woords shall serue, in haste I goe my way, And wish you well my perill to foresee: Be rulde by trueth, let Uertue beare the sway, Think on the end the daunger for to flee. For I haue proou'd that which I rew with payn: And wish to late I had not liu'd so vayne. FINIS. Honos alit Artes. FINIS. Antony Munday.</field>
