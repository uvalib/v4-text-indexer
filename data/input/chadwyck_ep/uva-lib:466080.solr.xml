      <field name="fulltext">OF THE ALTAR 1 INVENI QUEM DILIGIT ANIMA MEA What do I see? The semblance of a little wheaten cake Stampt with the image of Him Who for my sake Died on His Passion-tree. That wheat was grown in the eternal field, And threshed with love's own flail, and heavily ground Between the stones of life and death, and found In perfectness, that I might see revealed My Lover and my God; Him from Whose eyes There dropt the sorrow-drops all humanwise; Him at Whose nod The everlasting hills would quake and flee. This do I see. What do I see? The chalice seeming of the grapes' red juice, With water mingled, as for daily use. O Love and Lord of me, That juice is of the blood-red grapes that grew Upon the living Vine Whose fruitage knew The ripening of the everlasting Sun Whose course was ne'er begun. O Lover mine, O King, What is indeed this thing, This high, love-dreadful thing? Thy Life, Thy Death, Thy Resurrection, all The glory of Thine Ascension festival In these few minutes' space Passing before my face. Here do I bow my head, And in my heart be said Things of adoring love my tongue all weak Frames not itself to speak. Oh, here is bitterest bitter and sweetest sweet; And here is hunger and thirst and drink and meat; And here are clouds of agony, the mist Wherefrom doth rise the glory of the sun; Here the defeat and here the victory won; And here is God Himself in Eucharist. 2 FOUND IN THE TEMPLE Long since, a sorrowing woman sought her Son; Among her kinsfolk and acquaintance sought, And all in vain; till last her footsteps brought This Mother to God's temple. Daylight shone Upon her night of tears; her quest was won; For there she found her Darling. Wisdom-fraught, One glorious Charity, He sat and wrought The work His Father gave Him to be done. O Jesus, when we seek Thee sorrowing, Shall we not surely find Thee when we go Where Thy dear flamelet ever burns to show Thy Presence in Thy temple. Here we cling Unto Thy feet, dear Lord who stoopest low To lift us to the Presence of our King. 3 A SONNET OF THE MOST HOLY EUCHARIST To eye of sense, only a cake of wheat! To eye of sense, only a little wine! To Faith's clear sight, the Majesty divine, God's heart with its eternal human beat, And God's own wounded hands and wounded feet, And side, spear-torn to be for aye the shrine Where contrite hearts, pierced by that love benign, Know that His justice and His mercy meet. To Thee, O glorious Guest, to Thee whose word Of charity hath bidden us to be, Heart, soul and spirit bend with bended knee. Smite Thou and slay our hate, our pride, dear Lord, Here in our kneeling, with the two-edged sword Of Thy dread love and dread humility. 4 WHENCE TO ME Whence to me, that the Mother of my Lord Should come to me? So, from Elizabeth's humility, Went forth the word Before the inviolate Shrine, wherein that day The mighty Lord of all creation lay. Whence to us, that our God and Sovran Lord Should come to us? Come in His Manhead and His Godhead thus; Come to accord On this poor altar, made the loveliest place, His gift most wonderful, His sweetest grace? 6 IN REPARATION A First Friday's Communion What can we do, dear Lord, to make amends For all the ills that we have heaped on Thee? Our meanness for Thy generosity; The wrong of day by day, that never ends; The wounding in the house of us Thy friends;â And all the nameless weight of infamy, The unuttered shame of that fell century Whose blasting breath still day by day ascends? This will we do, most wronged, most patient One; At Thy dear feet Thy penitents will kneel, And Thou wilt lift them into Thy embrace, These who in reparation fair have won The gift of gifts wherein Thou dost reveal The splendour of Thine all-forgiving grace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OF THE SWEET MOTHER 7 CONCEPTA EST MARIAâI O ye four winds of Paradise, Breathe to and fro, That odours from the beds of spice To God may go; While the four rivers of Paradise In rhythm shall flow, And all the bloom of Paradise For God shall blow. Breathe, ye four winds of Paradise, North, south, east, west; News of the great and sweet emprize Bear on your breast: How the All-good, All-strong, All-wise, In dear behest, Sendeth to dwell beneath our skies A stainless guest. Breathe it, O winds of Paradise, North, south, east, west. Flow, ye four rivers of Paradise, East, west, north, south, Water the earth so long that lies In sorry drouth; Rivers that flow beneath God's eyesâ Words of His mouth, Flow, ye four rivers of Paradise, East, west, north, south. Bloom, all ye flowers of Paradise, In bright array; Bow, all ye flowers of Paradise, Your heads to-day; Lift them, and let all scents arise Wherewith to say The perfect Rose of Paradise Buds forth to-day. 8 CONCEPTA EST MARIAâII To-day within God's Eden-garth is sown Seed that shall be a plant for Him alone. To-day doth time the fair foundation see Of God's high fane of gold and ivory. That perfect plant shall bloom with Flower of God: That hallowed temple by His feet be trod. Full many a lily soul of God's delight; But none like Mary's soul, effulgent white. Full many a soul rose-red in love's true glow; But none like hers that fire and light shall know. And many a virgin hears the Bridegroom's call; But His own spotless one excels them all. Bear it aloft, the word that cannot fail; Hail, O thou full of grace, hail, Mary, hail! Mother most pure, Maiden most glorious, Mary Immaculate, oh, pray for us. 9 MATER AMABILIS Mater Amabilis, Ora pro nobis! Love-worthy Mother, Pray for your children. Among the host of lovely names you bear, O Mary, there is none more perfect-sweet Than that whereby your children ever greet Their Mother in the dear Lorettan prayer, Wherein, O God's beloved, they call you thisâ Mater Amabilis! Love-worthy Mother, you, love-worthy Maid, Whom all the generations rise to bless, Drew God to you in your love-worthiness, Which could accept Himself, nor be afraid, Nor aught of grace magnificent could miss,â Mater Amabilis! Love-worthy Mother, far and far doth reach Beyond the deepest depth, the highest height, Into the one illimitable light, What we essay to body forth in speech, Feeble, yet stronger for love's emphasis,â Mater Amabilis! Our earth in perfect fealty you trod, You only found all-fair, all-pure, all-true; Thrice worthy of the love we bring to you, The one found worthy of the love of God; Bear us on that dear Heart of yours to His,â Mater Amabilis! Sweet Mother, worthy of the Worthiest, Stoop down to us and take the love that we, Unworthy children, offer willingly, O Mother, who have borne Him on your breast! Those lovely feet of yours we bend to kiss,â Mater Amabilis! 10 PRAY FOR ME, MOTHER OF GOD! Pray for me, Mother of God! To you I cry. Pray for me, Mother, now and the hour I die. O if too weak to call on your darling name When the now and the hour of my death are one and the same, Failing of tongue, as failing of eye and of ear, Still on the beat of my heart my Mother shall hear Sweetest of names e'er given to the earth save One, Mother of mine, your name with the name of your Son. Jesus! Mary! O dearest and loveliest! His name on yours, as erst His head on your breast. Pray for me, Mother,âOh, pray for me now, I cry! God only knows if it be this hour I die. 11 OUR LADY'S CROWNS He crowned thee first, O Blessed One, with grace, And set thee, from thy fair conception hour, Creation's perfect seed and plant and flower, Beautiful in the brightness of His Face. He crowned thee next with joy, child of His love,â The joy wherein His whole world had its part; The supreme joy that waited for thy heart, Seeing none else could bear the weight thereof. And next He crowned thee with His sorrow,âthee He called upon His crucifixion morn, And girt thy brows with His own piercing thorn, And clothed thee with His purple of mockery. And last, in splendour full, of light and sound, In all the exultant sheen of Heaven's high day, He set thee in thy queendom, there for aye With glory everlasting robed and crowned. 12 TO THE MOTHER, FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN BONDS Sweet Mary Mother, of thy charity, Look down from heaven's high glory and joy to bless The holy ones on whom doth sorely press The mightiness of their desire to see His lovely face who died to set them free. Thou knowest they suffer sore for home-sickness; For that dear sight they pine in deep distress, In their own country they are fain to be. Pray for them, Mother, who know in such desire Pain vaster far than earth's most heavy woe, Because Love's fire transcends all other fire. O Mother, pray for them that they may know, These who in waiting and longing suffer so, The call bidding His darlings come up higher. 13 IMMACULATA, ORA PRO NOBIS A father's little chidren disobeyed His household laws, and grieved him very sore; And they, having grieved him, grieved, and so no more Was the old joyaunce by the children made. Because their hearts away from him had strayed, (Never his heart from them), they did implore One sister who was love to the heart's core To ask for pardon, they ashamed, afraid. She went, and love-like, looked up to his face, Saying, Forgive them! And the father smiled Upon his one love-perfect little child. I give thee thy sweet prayer, O full of grace: I pardon them, My dove, My undefiled: I set My children in their old dear place. 14 TO THE QUEEN OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY Give me a rose, my Mother, A rose, I pray, Out of your fadeless garden, All fresh to-day; Upon the scentful petals Your blessing lay, And give me, Queen and Mother, A rose, I pray. What colour will the rose be, O Mother bright? Purer than the argent moonshine, Of cloudless night; Whiter than snow sun-smitten On Alpine height; White with your own soul's whiteness, God's matchless white. Yes, give me, dear my Mother, This rose of white. Or will the petals, Mother, Be crimson-dyed, Red as your own Compassion, The ebbless tide That flowed at full when Jesus Hung crucified? Give me this rose, my Mother, Deep-crimson-dyed. Another rose, O Mother, A rose of gold, Each petal a ray of glory, The glory untold Of the light of the Sun of Justice, Your hand doth holdâ O Mother mine, that fairestâ That rose of gold. Two roses, white and crimson, Of your fair grace, Give to my bosom's keeping, And bid me trace In purity and loving, With steadfast pace, The way to the unveiled splendour Of Jesus' Face. The Golden Rose that is not Of time or space.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHRISTMASTIDE 16 BETHLEHEM BELLS 'Tis God's dear warden fosterer Joseph, Wendeth his way to Bethlehem; 'Tis God's own Maid who is in his keeping, And God's high angels go with them. (Hush! they will break the silence soon, Bethlehem bells of joyful tune.) Where shall her tender guardian bring her? For them no hostel opens a gate; Oh, but her hour is close upon her. Oh, but it groweth dark and late. (Hush! they will burst the dark profound, Bethlehem bells of loving sound.) Housed in a stable is Mary Mother; Cradled in manger God doth lie; Warden Joseph adores and watchesâ Red of the dawn is in the sky. (Hearken! hearken! above the cloud, Bethlehem bells ring sweet and loud.) Is this the place for the great King's dwelling? The sphere that to God Himself is given? Oh, for our King, what a sordid palace! Oh, for our God, what a sorry heaven! (Hark to the bells that ring abroad, Behold your King, behold your God!) Nothing it mattereth, palace or stable, The ways of God being great and even; Where the King is, there is the palace; God Himself is the making of Heaven. (They ring beyond moon, and sun, and star; They ring anear as they ring afar: Throughout all space they ring to-day, Bethlehem bells that ring for aye.) 18 JESUS IS BORN! Mourner, who goest Heart-sick and lorn, Here is thy comfort, Jesus is born! Happy one, wearing Rose without thorn, Deepen thy gladness, Jesus is born! Pilgrim, with journeying Weary and worn, Here is thy rest-place, Jesus is born! Babes whom He loveth, Laugh ye this morn, God's joy upon you, Jesus is born! Sinners unloving, Cease ye to scorn; Lo, for your pardon, Jesus is born! God hath fulfilled it, Promise long-sworn: Ring out Hosannas! Jesus is born! 20 AT THE MANGER Babe in the manger, low we kneel to Thee. What art Thou come to be? More than our lips can tell, exceedingly. Jesus, our Love, although we love Thee coldly; Jesus, our Captain, though we fight unboldly; Jesus, our Master, though we disobey Thee; Jesus, our Teacher, though we oft gainsay Thee. Jesus, the Way of peace and joy exceeding; Jesus, the very Truth, our footsteps leading; Jesus, the Light above the dark prevailing; Jesus, our Daily Bread of Life unfailing. Babe in the manger, low we kneel to Thee, Lord, who art come to be More than our hearts may know, eternally. 22 CHRISTMAS, 1915 O bells that ring at midnight, dawn and morn, The Christ is born, ye say, the Christ is born. The little Prince of Peace in manger lies, And God looks on His world through a Babe's eyes. Yet flame and blood proclaim that world at war; And anguish broods above all things that are. Still, still persistent bells proclaim this Birth Bringing good will to men, and peace on earth. Peace and good will in war and hate's despite: Dawn of the day, though dark and long the night. For, whether fields on earth be lost or won, The banners of the King go on, go on. And whether march of Time be swift or slow, The banners of the King shall forward go. Yea, though the world by wars be rent and torn, For evermore the Prince of Peace is born: And Faith and Love proclaim in Bethlehem speech, Glad tidings of great joy to all and each.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PASSIONTIDE AND EASTER 23 BEHOLD YOUR KING! Behold your King! Oh, sorrow of this thing! His face from shame and spitting He doth not hide; Suffers His eyes to be blinded, His hands to be tied; On His shoulders the slavedom's loathly gallows will let them lay, Will carry it, fall with it, rise again, fall again, on through the Sorrowful Way. Behold your King! Oh, the uncomely thing! Oh, the most blessed thing, Thus to behold our King. To look on One On Whose back the plowers have plowed those furrows of theirs; Who standeth in silence wrapt, nor answereth By the word of immortal life to the question of mortal death. Purple, in sooth, He wears, And that is a crown He bears; And what is the purple but cloak that a soldier has worn? And what is the crown but spikes of the platted thorn? And what is the sceptre, indeed, But a reed? Robed and crowned and sceptred, where His throne? Even the cross of the wicked to hang upon. Behold your King! Oh, wondrous joyful thing! Here in His immortality, No more to die. Our King of might, Our King of love, In garments dight By glory wove. Our King with hands that show Marks jewel-bright where the dark nails did go; Whose glorious feet are doubly glorified By the red gems that were love's wounds; whose side Displays the ruby of great price, where flowed Water and blood. We who beheld our King In shame and anguishing Look on Him now, As the black thorns that pierced His brow We know for rays of light, Quenchless and infinite. See Him ascend, Our King, our God, our Friend, Up to the supreme heights where love has part, Who knew the very core of suffering's heart. And see Him, as we kneel before Him thus, Stoop from His glory to abide with us.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN SPLENDORIBUS SANCTORUM 24 ST. GABRIEL THE ARCHANGEL Many an angel stands around Mary Queen in glory crowned; Mary Queen loves them well; but most she loveth Gabriel. Of all angels round the Throne, Gabriel is Mary's own. Evermore with sweetest breath Hail Mary! Gabriel saith. When Lucifer down fell from Love's heaven to Pride's hell, Gabriel fair, strong, tried, stood with Michael on God's side, When he smote the serried host warring with the Holy Ghost. Gabriel's heart a message heard of the Everlasting Word. Gabriel's face new splendour took from the splendour of God's look. Gabriel's swift love-shod feet to the rhythm of travel beat; Gabriel's luminous wings spread wideâdropt when God said Abide. Other work is to do ere that message time be due. Gabriel's feet went many roads in the will at one with God's. Gabriel saw chaos stirred by the voice of God's word. Gabriel saw the void fill with the beauty of His will. And Gabriel saw the birth of time from heaven for earth: Saw too God's purpose fair in man and woman there. His voice in joy's chorus rang when the stars of morning sang. Gabriel who saw man made saw man's Maker disobeyed; Saw the shut, guarded gate; heard the word bidding Wait. Gabriel's day went on and on, seeing many an errand done. To the captive in strange land Gabriel's voice said Understand. And his tongue set wide ope God's golden gate of hope. Time goes, time flies; ever see Gabriel's eyes Even as God bids them see who possess eternity. Gabriel's feet tread again where Lucifer wrought pain. Gabriel's message falls free on the ear of Zachary. Gabriel waits a little space in the light of God's face. Then God bids him know His dear will sayeth Go. Go with greatest message e'er great angelhood might bear. Swifter than light can run down to earth from her sun, Gabriel flashes forth, a ray from the heart of God's day; Looks on Mary Virgin's face; kneels, hails her Full of Grace. God's sweetest name of all from his lips first doth fall. Of all angels round the Throne Gabriel is Mary's own. Evermore with sweetest breath Hail Mary! Gabriel saith. 25 JOSEPH, FILI DAVID, NOLI TIMERE O just one, thou didst hear God bid thee not to fear. Fear not to take to thee Thy wife, Mary. Fear not the closed inn; Fear not to win Shelter for thy sweet care Where oxen fare. Fear not the midnight, bright With Light of Light. Fear not to have thy King In fostering. Fear not the exile road, Bearing thy God. Fear not the quiet breath Of Nazareth. Fear not for Him who plies Work 'neath thine eyes. Fear not for her whose fame Splendours thy name. Fear not, O comforter Of Him and her! Fear not at last to die, With these Two by. Fear not to take thy crown, Thy blest renown. And grant us aye and e'er Thy fostering care, That so we too may hear God bid us not to fear. 26 ST. STEPHEN, FIRST MARTYR Thine eyes, O Stephen, saw thy Lord and God Standing to greet His martyr, from whose tongue The accents of His living truth had rung: First of the band who follow where He trod, Like His, thy blood gave blessing to the sod; Like His thy pardoning prayer for those that flung Death over thee. To him in grace it clung, Who was to wear love's ring, love-robed and shod. To many a one thy âWelcome Homeâ was given; But welcome's joy in supreme radiance glowed When, chief among thy pardoned foes, full-shriven, That soul in triumph entered God's abode, (The Vision lent erewhile, for aye bestowed), And Paul unshamed beheld the face of Stephen. 27 ST. JOHN THE EVANGELIST Thou darling of the Master's heart, what gift for thee were best, Who liest at the Paschal board upon that Master's breast? A wondrous gift shall come to thee, thou highly favoured one, A gift of worth untold, beneath to-morrow's darkened sun. Oh, in thy depth of love and woe, to-morrow thou shalt be With her, the Mother of thy Lord, by His Redemption Tree. Thy mother, John, had craved for thee by Him a royal seat: This mother sees thee standing now below His bleeding feet. And He, whose plenitude of love knows neither stint nor thrift, Shall give to thee, His well-beloved, His Mother for a gift. Behold thy Mother! Thus, in thee, to all His ransomed ones, Mother, behold thy son! Behold thine own unnumbered sons! 28 SAINTS ROUND THE ALTAR Oh, they throng, the countless Hallows, round the altar where He lies, Whom we see by Faith's high vision, Whom they see with open eyes. These, the glorious Saints of Jesus, women and men who held on high Fast the standard of the Lamb through all their sharpest agony. These, the lovely Saints of Jesus, women and men whose lives confest Through the good of God's bestowing the perfection of His best. These, the darling baby Hallows, crowned with golden crowns that press No whit heavier than the daisy wreaths of childly happiness. Oh, the whiteness of their raiment, raiment washed in priceless Blood! Oh, the brightness of their faces, blest in Love's beatitude! Saints of Jesus, Saints of Jesus, who your blest reward have won, At His altar we are kneeling, in your sweet communion. We the erring, we the feeble, we by storm-winds tossed and driven, We the conquered in the battles where so faintly we had striven. We with sordid spirit meanly who look down and thus deny To our eyes the unuttered grandeur of God's generosity. We who grovel, seeking, searchingâwe, the children of the Kingâ Soiled possessions, worthless havings, with a muckrake gathering. Pray for us, O happy Hallows, ye who bring to this high place Honour folded in His honour, grace reflexion of His grace. Pray for us all weak and needing, yet who say in faith serene, This your Monarch is our Brother, and our Mother is your Queen! 29 TE CANDIDATUS LAUDET EXERCITUS Lord and God, with hearts uplifted do we render thanks to Thee, And confess Thee in the splendours of Thy saints eternally! In the splendours of Thy martyrs we confess Thee, Lord and God, In the glorious white-robed army who through blood and fire have trod. Multitudes of men and women, by Thy love allured, sufficed, Laying down the life He gave them at the feet of Jesus Christ. Oh, the call of Jesus rang through every fibre of their frame, And they rose and followed Jesus to His hill of death and shame. Oh, the call of Jesus sounded, My beloved, come up higher! And they passed into His glory through the heart of blood and fire. Great the army as it marches past the bounds of time and space, In the glory of the vision of the Lord's unveiled face. Band of baby Hallows, fearless of the smiters' sword, who made Crowns and palms their childly playthings in the sacrificial shade. See the Hymn for Lauds, Feast of the Holy Innocents. Glorious Prophets and Apostles; Keepers of the mighty Keys; Folk unnoticed and forgotten, numbered now with such as these. Boys and girls yet keeping dew of youth upon their locks undried; Aged ones whose faith undaunted force of sword and fire defied. Prime of manhood, soldiers, rulers, kings of science and of song; Women wearing Mary's mantle, and in Mary's spirit strong. And while time with us abideth, and the King of Love hath foes, Still the white-robed martyr army in its strength and number grows. Trinity of love transcendent, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, We confess Thee, we adore Thee, in Thy white-robed martyr host!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OTHER DEVOTIONAL POEMS 30 CREDO What is our God, the God we own, Before whose feet in spirit we fall; Who makes, preserves, destroys alone, And fills all by containing all; St. Augustine. Who is from all eternity, In whom we breathe and move and be? The Lord of Hosts, the Prince of Peace, Whose eyes unerring look upon High angelhood that veils to bless The Holy, Holy, Holy One; And manhood in the germ, that yet Shall be in Godlike splendour set. They war, His angels and His men, Or in deep peace they do His will; Its meaning high above their ken, Guessing or not, they do it still, Through past and now and future rolled In Ã¦ons never to be told. We raise the stone, and Him we find; Logion. We cleave the wood, and He is there; We see Him through the tears that blind, We touch with lifted hands of prayer; Before His altar, on His sod, We know our Lover and our God. A King of dreadful majesty, A King of love more dreadful yet; In whom the world's foundations be, Whose eyes with human tears were wet; The Lord of Life, who lay alone, A corpse behind a sealÃ©d stone. He took the measure of a span Who filleth all infinitude; Maker of man, and very Man; Immortal dying on a Rood; And all Creation's heart is bowed To this her God who wore her shroud. And more, yet more; from glory won, Magnificence inherited, He stoops to hold communion With man in veils of wine and bread; O height of love! O love's abyss! Man face to face with God in this! Before the angels' joyful shout, Or morning stars' high harmonies; Before the birth of faith or doubt, Ere Death, contending for the prize, In wrestling fierce with Life had striven, The Love-begotten Love was given. If million after million Of years rolled o'er the world, His thought, Yet in the time of ripeness won He for whom time and space are nought, Infinitude, Eternity, Hung, time-revealed, upon a Tree. If millions more uncounted fall Slow down Eternity's abyss, Before this God be all in all, What betwixt Him and man is this? With Him no future is, no past But one great now, for aye to last. He doeth that, and suffereth Its doing, which we tremble at; Lets slip the dogs of war and death; Binds fast with iron chains and great; One nation crowns with glory; one Putteth to sore confusion. Yet Love, in veil of mystery, Is He; no cruel Fate and stark Which grips the trembling souls that lie And shudder in their lonely dark; Or at some dreadful Presence guess, More dreadful than the loneliness. O Thou, considering tenderly The feeble tongues that lisp Thy state, The wavering souls that stay on Thee, By gentleness of Thine made great; Love, Love, and Love, revealed, unknown, Thee we adore and Thee we own! 31 THE SPIRIT INDEED IS WILLING, BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK O three He calls to watch with Him close by the reddening sod Where drops the sweat of agony, the agony of God. O three of watch in sleep forgone, your flesh too weak will prove; And angelhood shall comfort Him, and not your human love. And more, yet more; the hour draws nigh, the traitor's This is He. The kiss, the clash of swords and clubs, and ye to turn and flee. And one of you with curse and oath will e'en deny the Friend Who, loving in the world His own, had loved them to the end. And one alone, to-morrow noon shall dare the shame and dread, To stand beneath the cross till all shall be consummated. Yet all you three in supreme love and supreme courage high Shall will to suffer and work for Him, shall dare for Him to die. Lord Jesus, Who hast bid Thy friends anear Thee watch to keep, If earthly heaviness weigh down our eyelids and we sleep, Speak Thou to us, as once to those Thy gentleness did speak, The spirit truly wills aright, although the flesh be weak. Oh, be the spirit willing then, to strive in might afresh, And let the spirit's might o'ercome the weakness of the flesh. Bid us to cast the dread away, to fling the shame aside, And follow on where these have led, for Thee who lived and died. 32 GIVER OF LIGHT Giver of light, the dark was on Thy soul; Bringer of joy, great woe was at Thy breast; Weary of limb, Thou giv'st Thy children rest; Wounded and torn, Thou mak'st Thy children whole. Gladness they know from Thy most bitter dole, Food from Thy hunger, holiest drink and best From thirst of Thine, Thou Love made manifest: And from Thy crown of thorns their aureole. O Lord our God, yet darkly do we see; But still the blood-marked way where Thou didst tread Shines with a radiance more than morning's red, Or sunset's flush: and following after Thee We seek the Resurrection of the dead, And find the Life of all eternity. 33 SEEKERS The soul through love that seeketh Through love will sure attain, Whether the love bring gladness, Whether the love bring pain. To them that knock God opens, He bids them find who seek; And one knocks loud and home-like, And one taps low and weak; One sees afar in searching; Another is slow of sight; One goeth his way unwearied; Another hath little might. But each and every seeker Love-led to make the quest, Shall know the joy of finding; In finding shall be blest. 35 ANY CHILD TO THE NEW-FOUND MOTHER I AD MATREM, SANCTAM ECCLESIAM O my Mother, fair exceeding, with the lovely smile august, And the true lips, ever pleading for the holy things and just, To thy little one's great needing Thou hast bent thy gracious heeding, And hast bidden her to love thee, as she must. For thy love of love has won her, and the Voice Divine has said, â'Tis the Mother, look upon her, of my living, of my dead!â And the radiancy and honour of thy chrism, O glorious donor, And the blessing of thy mouth are on her head. Storm-clouds far away have drifted, chased by splendour of thine eyes, And, with peace and joy fair-gifted, here, thy little child, she lies, By thine arms of comfort lifted where, upon the Rock unrifted, God hath set thee, Bride of Jesus, perfectwise. In that peace and joy's bestowing, thou hast spoken to her heart, Saying, âChild, in all thy going let thy brothers' needs have part: For my strayed, for my unknowing, for my holy saved, still owing, Mine to love and suffer, pray and trust, thou art.â II AD MATREM, SANCTUM ECCLESIAM Sweet my Mother, thou hast called, and I have heard That which thrilled my soul and stirred; Yea, mine own beloved, thou hast bid me come To thy heart, which is my home: And I lie in happy shelter on thy breast, As a young bird in its nest. Dear, I thought another's voice the voice of thee, That was speaking unto me. Had I heard thy voice, oh, should I not have known From all other tone its tone? Had I ever seen the truth within thine eyes, I had bid my soul arise; I had hastened, dare I hope and think, to flee, Glorious Mother, unto thee! Thou, my liberal-souled and tender, leav'st unchid Those who knew not what they did. Steeped in radiance of thy love, I do not shrink, O my Mother! as I think That those kindest, tenderest hands can wield the sword Of the judgement of the Lord; Shoot the arrows of His wrath from out His bow,â Yea, beloved, it is so! For thy love is as thy Lord's; and thine intent, In thy sternest punishment, Is the saving of the souls of His desire, Holy Mother, as by fire. Ever one with Him in will, His heart, His bride, Thou defied art He defied; Thou beloved art He beloved; and in thy face Is the fulness of His grace. 37 TO MY GUARDIAN ANGEL At Lustleigh, Devon, September. Angel mine, I am glad to be Here in this beautiful hill country; Glad, so glad, to have left the town, And see the blue instead of the brown. Oh, such a wonder of purple and blue, Lovely, my angel, even to you Who know the ineffable heights that rise In the smile of God our Father's eyes. Tell me, is it not easier far To be good where space and colouring are, Here, in the glory of Lustleigh down, Than far to the east, in London Town? Friend of the kind, wise brow, I wot I speak as a child that knoweth not. But oh, thank God for these hills so dear; And oh, thank God that He brought me here. Angel mine, to whom it is given To know the glorious heights of heaven, To drink from the undefilÃ©d rills That rise in the everlasting hills, Teach me, through these my mortal eyes Something of them to realize; Learning, in this my mortal spell, The invisible things by the visible. Bid hills of Devon whisper me Thought of what heaven's fair heights must be, Those heights that Mary in spirit trod As she carried the happy news of God In swiftness all unhurriedly To her blessed kin of the hill country, All the while that her spirit fair Was breathing the dear own-country air Far above earthly joys and ills, On the heights of the everlasting hills. Help me to gain the footing sure Of those the dear Lord counteth pure, On the glorious hills that Mary knew, And ever calleth her children to. 38 KEEPING IN GIVING We lay our hand upon our dearest thing, And take it to the altar, as we say, âLord, here we come Thy calling to obey, Who would not keep back aught from Thee, our King. Lo, this our fairest, choicest offering Before Thy feet with willing heart we lay: Accept the sacrifice we make to-day, Accept the best beloved gift we bring.â But let us well beware lest thought should seek The ram caught in the briers; some device Whereby the joy of keeping might be won. O God, have mercy on Thy children weak, Who think to offer perfect sacrifice, Yet crave redemption for the only son. 39 THE MASTER'S WILL Thou new-annealed, who in thy love dost ache To pour out suffering nard-like on His feet, 'Tis great things thou art fain to do; His wheat Sow, reap and thresh, nor any wages take; The stones upon His roadway sit and break; Panting and thirsty, for the desperate heat, Or shivering in the heavy wind and sleet; Only to suffer, suffer for His sake. And what if thus the Lover of lovers said; âNot thine the way of brake and tearing brier; Not thine the torment of the frost and fire; I give thee gladness, of My passion bred; I give thee joy; and this is My desire Thou keep its morning-dew upon thy head.â 40 IN COMMENDATION Into the hands that have fashioned the all, Into the hands that were pierced at Love's call. The hands of our Father, our Brother, our Friend, The soul of this brother of ours we commend. We bless Thee, O Father, for all that was fair In him of our love, and we lift up our prayer That, wherever the earth-mist have swept o'er his sight, Its dark be disperst in Thine infinite light. Thou hearest, O Thou of the ear ever nigh, As out of the depths unto Thee is our cry For pardon and health and the ultimate grace Of the day that is vision of Thee face to face. Thus, into the hands that have fashioned the all, Thus, into the hands that were pierced at Love's call, The hands of our Father, our Brother, our Friend, The soul of this brother of ours we commend. 41 MAKE ME LOVE THEE SO O Jesus, make me love Thee so I shall not ask, nor care, to know Where Thou wouldst have me go. I would, my Lord, my God, I were Like those true souls that have no care Except Thy life to share, And love Thee in that perfectness Of self-surrender Thou wilt bless With calm in toil and stress. Like them indeed I cannot be; I cannot love Thee worthily; Yet, Jesus, look on me. Break Thou my heart with that sweet look Which, more than bitterest rebuke, Can pierce who Thee forsook: And heal the heart deep-wounded thus With Thy sweet comfort luminous, Dear Heart, pierced through for us. 42 THE LADY COURTESY Whence art thou, O thou Lady Courtesy? What strain illustrious hath given thee birth? Was a High-King thy father? Did our earth Give a High-Queen the grace of bearing thee? What court hath reared thee, so exceedingly Beautiful in transcendency of worth That shames the praise whose fulness is but dearth. Tell us thy lineage and thine own country. Love is my father, Charity my mother. Of these great two-in-one begotten and borne, I came to earth with song o' the sons of morn, Whose sister am I; and each, beloved brother. Yea, I am of a Court unearthly fair; All-courteous God hath presence-chamber there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOR A CHILD 43 GIVE ME THINE HEART Let me do some little thing For the love of Christ my King: Something brave and gentle too, Something He would have me do. Let me say some little word For the love of Christ my Lord: Little word of help or praise; Little kindly word always. Let me bear some little thing For the love of Christ my King: Little disappointment, loss; Not be sullen, not be cross. P'raps I mayn't do anything Specially to please my King: Maybe none will want my deed; Maybe none my word will need. P'raps I shan't be vexed at all; P'raps âall rightâ till evenfall: Shall I then, to please my King, Have no little offering? No. There's something yet more fair Than to do, or speak, or bear: So all day I'll try to be What my King desires of me. And, when I kneel down at night, Fold my hands in Jesus' sight, Tell Him that I've tried to be All that he would like to see; Say I've loved Him all the day.â Then I think He'll smile and say: Little child, you've done your best, And I love you. Go to rest. 44 FROM NAZARETH TO CALVARY Jesus is Lord of all, and He Became a little child like me. Our dear St. Joseph worked and won Keep for the darling Foster-Son; And Blessed Mary spun and sewed And cooked and swept, and always shewed The sweetest love, the holiest care, For little Jesus living there. And as the Boy, from year to year, So good, so great of heart, so dear, Grew on in wisdom and in grace, He also worked in that sweet place. Then, by-and-by, our Jesus went From that blest home where He had spent So many years; went to fulfil His Father's will, which was His will. He always did that will, and so, When God had told Him forth to go, He went to do whate'er it meant; To suffer and to die content. I have my cosy little bed: He had not where to lay His head. And love for me a home has made: And He was hated and betrayed. God loved us, and His love was such No one but He could love so much; And this was why, from Nazareth, Dear Jesus went to Calvary's death. And this was why, when death was o'er, He lived again, to die no more. What can we do for Him who cared So much for us; for Him who shared Our life, and died that we might dwell With Him in joy? 'Tis love Him well. And better still, and still more blest Isâlove this darling Jesus best. 45 BEFORE THE TABERNACLE Sweetest Jesus, kind and dear, For my sake abiding here, Not in glory bright and great, But in poor and mean estate; Look on me who kneel before This Your little curtained door. Through that door if I could see, You would look like bread to me; But Yourself is there, I know, For Yourself has told me so. Humbly here I kneel and pray; Help me, Jesus, day by day, Till the time when I shall see You in all Your majesty. Help me, Jesus, to refrain From all naughty words and vain, And from every naughty deed Like the things that made You bleed. By the wounds Your dear hands bore, Give me grace to love You more; By the wounding of Your Feet, Teach me Your obedience meet; By the wounding of Your Side, Let me in Your Heart abide. Bless my dear ones, dearest Lord, In their thought and deed and word; Bless, dear Jesus, every one. Jesus sweet, my time is done, So, good-bye. And yet I know How Your love will with me go, Though within the church You stay All the night and all the day. 46 A KING'S DAUGHTER OF HETHENESSE How she was strangely made ready to receive the Faith, seeing as in a vision the great things that befell when the Lord Jesus redeemed the world: how the monks who brought the Great Message to her father's Court were slain, all save one: how the King's daughter fled the country and won to a Christian land, being baptized on the way thither: how she was taken to a convent: how the Great Message through her prayers unceasing was again sent to her father, and how he received the Faith. Told by her to the nuns of the convent wherein she was Abbess, when she lay a-dying, and by the Abbess who came after her set down in writing. Our Mother, whose love was the drawing of souls to their God, Lay dying, and I was of those upon whom was bestowed The sweetest of honour, to sit by the side of our saint, And watch, with love-hearing, love-seeing, for token most faint Of a wish love is quick to interpret and seek to fulfil, From her, whose dear will, as we knew it, was one with God's will. All strangely the fever had smitten, and hurt her, and burned, And sad were our vigils beside her, and daylight returned Each morning, and looked on our sorrow, for she whom we loved Was gript in the fangs of the fever, and wildly she moved; And the words on her dear holy lips were all strange to our ears, Some tongue that not one of us knew; and we cried through our tears And our anguish to Him who stood weeping by Lazarus' grave, And prayed Him, because of His sorrow, to help her and save: And we cried to our Lady of Grief, to His Mother most dear, And we wept to the Saints whom we loved, that strong prayer in God's ear Might even prevail, and our stricken beloved one arise As of old, with His praise on her tongue, and His love in her eyes. But not by our prayers and our tears might her healing be won, So we kneeled in submission and prayed that His will might be done. Then peace came upon her; the fever went out of her eyes. And she lay as a comforted baby that blessedly lies In the arms of the mother that loves it; and calm was her face As she smiled on her children with all the old sweetness and grace. The Shrift and the Unction were given her, and day after day, The Food for the journey was brought her, and happy she lay. And the strength of her love still enwrapt us, as calm on the height Of her Phasge she looked on the country of love and of light. Full often she spoke to us, tender of heart and of speech, Whose silence much more than the words of all others could teach: And lastly she told us the marvellous tale of her youth, How God led her forth from her country and kin by His Truth; And my Sisters, who chose me, unworthy, to sit in her place, Have prayed me to write it, and so, by the help of God's grace, I essay it. God grant that it be to the glory of Him, Though the gold of her telling be dulled and the fine gold be dim. We deem of her happy in rest, peace, refreshment, indeed; Yet pray for the soul of our Mother, and pray for our need. The Abess's Story I was a mighty king's daughter, who knew not the Name Whereby we are saved; and one feast-day, at noon-tide, there came A lad from the bounds of our kingdom, who told us that men Were come from a country far off, and were waiting as then With a message of peace unto men of good will. Then my sire Laughed loud, and the princes laughed too, and he called the lad nigher, To know of him who was the monarch whose message of peace Was sent unto him, the most mighty; to him whose increase Was the waxing of earth, and whose failing her sorrowful wane.â And the lad smiled a smile in his calmness, and answered again, âSir King, they who sent me will tell thee.â Great laughter and mirth Out leapt at the word of my sire, âHe is king of all earth, Small doubt, who hath sent us a herald so mighty as thou, Ungrown of the beard and the shoulders, and smooth of the brow!â But the lad, lowly louting, spake nought, though I deemed his heart said, âMy King is the greatest of kings of the living and dead!â Then my father made sign unto me, who was standing anear, To approach him yet nearer; and whispered his word in my ear. I heard him, and trembled and shuddered, but knew not the why, For oft he had bid me, his daughter, to look with the eye Of the sight beyond sight I was born with, and tell what should be; For the wisdom of women was on me, and far could I see; I heard what was silent for him, and I saw what was veiled, And oft I had saved his great lordship from woes that assailed, For the soul of a prophet was in me; but now I stood stark, And the heart of me died in my bosom, as, stifling and dark, The silence enwrapped me and held me. My women upraised, And took me away from the sight of the courtiers that gazed, And bore to a chamber soft-lighted, to lay on a bed And watch me, as women sit watching their lady that's dead. Not stilled was the shout of the feast, nor its laughter made vain, For they deemed I should rise from my trance to behold them again. Oh the blindness and darkness that wrapped me! The loneness and woe Of the spirit that goeth alone where her mates cannot go! A land of the shadow of death, and the quenching of life; A land of the breaking of hope, and of anguish and strife; A land of upheaval and terror, a land of despair, Of a presence that blasted and slew with its cark and its care. But out of the blindness and darkness of night, and the awe Of the sorrow and loneness, One lifted my soul, and I saw Far away to the still happy blue of the sky and the sea,â Where the meeting of ocean and ether unwist of by meâ That blue was a glory of tenderness radiant and soft, And the birds therein spread out their wings, as they soared high aloft; And the light of the distant gleamed lovely and lighted the near, And the eyes that were blessed by the sight of the far-off grew clear, Till I knew of a beauty, a splendour more fair than a dream, And I knew that it was and would be, nor a whit did it seem. The glory sank down to my soul, and the fear was all gone, And I looked out with eyes newly purged, and they looked upon One More fair than the men that I knew, than the gods that I guessed, With the love of the earth and the heaven for a zone round His breast; With the might of the Maker of all for a crown on His head, And with eyes that could pierce to the heart of the hell of the dead; With lips that were bright with the radiance of utterance like gold, And hands that were strong with the strength that ne'er droops nor grows old. The glory of youth and of prime, and the glory of eld, Behaloed the Body enshrining the Spirit beheld By men who had willed the beholding, by women who loved, And children who laughed in His arms in their joy unreproved. They thought I had died, and they came with their anguish and wail. And dressed me in garments of splendour, and laid on the bale; But I rose, and I spakeâLet them come, O my father, for lo! I have tasted the bitter of darkness, the sweet of a glow That spake to the heart of the darkness and bad it depart; And I kneel to a Presence unknown with the knee of my heart. Then the black-vested men with the tonsure were fetched, and I stood, And knew they were speaking, and bowed me, and knelt to the Rood, And the tale that they told was the tale of Redemption. I sat, As one who with ears of the listening hears nothing thereat. And I know not, have no understanding of how I was taught, But the rapture and awe was upon me; the vision was brought That blinded me, glad of the blinding for so could I see The vision again in its beauty that came unto me; To me, who should know of the men what they knew and believed, But could not hold open my eyes for the glory received On the eye-balls, whose lids were close-shut, to behold Him once more, The Lord of high fairness and worship I saw heretofore. But, lo! as I looked on Him steadily, dimness dropped down, And the glory was blotted away in the dusk of a frown From a Face that I saw not, for no man could live did he see; And I saw how the Face was in shadow, and slow upon me, Came the vision, the last of my visions for ever. I knew, Even I, how a tree was uplifted stark-straight 'gainst the blue, And a bar ran across it, and wide on that bar were outstretched The arms of the Mighty, the Glorious; and sighings were fetched From the heart of the world as the Fairest hung heavily there, And the lips of Him parted to utter a cry of despair, The lips that were parched in the anguish of terrible thirst; And I knew in the depth of my soul how the Last and the First, With thorns for the crown, and blood-chrism, and cross for the throne, Was King over Death by His dying. I knew that alone He entered the place of the veiling, the realms of the shade, To give God again the lost world which through Him had been made. The Spirit commended to God and the Body all slack, And the sun gone away from the heaven and the night-tide come back. I watched as the hours of His darkness rolled heavily on, Till the sun rose again, and grew high, and fell low, and was gone; And the earth passed again into darkness, and kept her embrace Of the Body in wrappings of linen, the white-covered Face; And the fragrance of spikenard and myrrh was in every fold Of the cerements that clung to the Body, so stiff and so cold: But the tomb was all filled with a fragrance more fragrant than nard, As the Fairest One lay in the bosom of darkness, and shared The sleep that's alike for the highest and meanest of men, Till the earth had passed out of the shadow of darkness, and thenâ Oh, gladness exceeding! Oh, light of all splendours the sum! Oh, glory of praise to love's glory, for Easter has come! Then I rose in the light, and I lifted my voice to proclaim The King, and the Lord and the Master, Christ Jesus, His name. I spake to the priests, and they listened, and little they said, But looked upon me as though looking on one who had fed On the fruitage of Eden, by man unwithheld, unbestowed, From the hand of no angel, indeed, but the hand of her God. But the hearts of my kinsmen were angry because of this thing, And they fell on the men of good-will and the peace of the King, And left them all ghastly and broken, bedrenched with their blood, And they laughed, and they shouted, and maddened, and trampled the Rood. And late, when I stole through the darkness to help, an I might, But one of the priests was alive, and I helped him that night, And we fled from the land through the wilds, in the deep of the shade, And he sealed me Lord Christ's in a stream that we crossed undismayed; And he gave me the fairest of names, of the Mother of God. Me, the first fruits, and only, as then, of the Faith on the sod. So we passed out together, God-guided, until that we came To the land of a people that knew of the Lord by His name; He gave me in charge to the Abbess, whose convent looked down From the height of the hills on the pastures that girded a town; And there did I pray for my father and each of my kin, That He who had died for us all would assoil them of sin. Monks bore them the message of peace and good will once again, And they listened, and bowed the knee low, where the martyrs were slain. I know, for the merchants have told it, that now in that land, Where my father once ruled in the might that no man could withstand, High honour is paid to the Name that is high above names, And the crucified Maker of man, in allegiance that claims The soul, and the spirit, and body, is worshipped and loved, And the idols are swept into darkness, untroubled, unmoved. So now ye have heard me, my Sisters, and know of God's ways To me and to mine in the flesh, in the spirit, His praise Be uplifted by me and by mine,ânay, the whole world uplift Its heart to its Maker and Lover, the Giver, the Gift. O children He gave me, abide in the love that makes whole, And pray for the souls that He died for, and pray for my soul.</field>
