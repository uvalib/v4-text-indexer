      <field name="fulltext">ATHELSTON 1 Lord, þat is off my?tys most, Fadyr and sone and holy gost, Bryng vs out off synne, And lene vs grace so for to wyrke, To loue boþe God and holy kyrke, Þat we may heuene wynne. Lystnes, lordyngys þat ben hende, Off falsnesse, hou it wil ende A man þat ledes hym þerin. Off foure weddyd breþeryn I wole ?ow tel, Þat wolden yn Yngelond go dwel, Þat sybbe were nou?t off kyn. 2 And alle foure messangeres þey were, Þat wolden yn Yngelond lettrys bere, As it wes here kynde. By a forest gan þey mete Wiþ a cros, stood in a strete, Be leff vndyr a lynde. And, as þe story telles me, Ylke man was of dyuers cuntre, In book iwreten we fynde— For loue of here metyng þare, Þey swoor hem weddyd breþeryn for euermare, In trewþe trewely dede hem bynde. 3 Þe eldeste off hem ylkon, He was hy?t Athelston, Þe kyngys cosyn dere; He was off þe kyngys blood, Hys eemes sone, I vndyrstood; Þerfore he ney?yd hym nere. And at þe laste, weel and fayr, Þe kyng hym dyyd withouten ayr; Þenne was þer non hys pere But Athelston, hys eemes sone; To make hym kyng wolde þey nou?t schone, To corowne hym with gold so clere. 4 Now was he kyng semely to se: He sendes afftyr hys breþeryn þre, And gaff hem here warysoun. Þe eldest broþir he made eerl of Douere— And þus þe pore man gan couere— Lord off tour and toun. Þat oþer broþer he made eerl of Stane— Egelond was hys name, A man off gret renoun— And gaff hym tyl hys weddyd wyff Hys owne sustyr, dame Edyff, Wiþ gret deuocyoun. 5 Þe ferþe broþir was a clerk, Mekyl he cowde off Goddys werk: Hys name it was Alryke. Cauntyrbury was vacant And fel into þat kyngys hand; He gaff it hym, þat wyke, And made hym bysschop of þat stede, Þat noble clerk, on book cowde rede— In þe world was non hym lyche. Þus avaunsyd he hys broþer þorw? Goddys gras, And Athelston hymseluen was A good kyng and a ryche. 6 And he þat was eerl off Stane— Sere Egeland was hys name— Was trewe, as ?e schal here. Þorw? þe my?t off Goddys gras, He gat vpon þe countas Twoo knaue-chyldren dere. Þat on was fyfftene wyntyr old, Þat oþer þryttene, as men me told: In þe world was non here pere— Also whyt so lylye-flour, Red as rose off here colour, As bry?t as blosme on brere. 7 Boþe þe eerl and hys wyff, Þe kyng hem louede as hys lyff, And here sones twoo; And offtensyþe he gan hem calle Boþe to boure and to halle, To counsayl whenne þey scholde goo. Þerat sere Wymound hadde gret envye, Þat eerl off Douere, wyttyrlye, In herte he was ful woo; He þou?te al for here sake False lesyngys on hem to make, To don hem brenne and sloo. 8 And þanne sere Wymound hym beþou?te: ‘Here loue þus endure may nou?te; Þorw? wurd oure werk may sprynge.’ He bad hys men maken hem ?are; Vnto Londone wolde he fare, To speke wiþ þe kynge. Whenne þat he to Londone come, He mette with þe kyng ful sone. He sayde: ‘Welcome, my derelyng.’ Þe kyng hym fraynyd soone anon Be what way he hadde igon, Wiþouten ony dwellyng. 9 ‘Come þou ou?t be Cauntyrbery, Þere þe clerkys syngen mery Boþe erly and late? Hou faryth þat noble clerk, Þat mekyl can on Goddys werk? Knowest þou ou?t hys state? And come þou ou?t be þe eerl off Stane, Þat wurþy lord in hys wane? Wente þou ou?t þat gate? Hou fares þat noble kny?t, And hys sones fayr and bry?t, My sustyr, ?iff þat þou wate?’ 10 ‘Sere,’ þanne he sayde, ‘wiþouten les, Be Cauntyrbery my way I ches; Þere spak I wiþ þat dere. Ry?t weel gretes þee þat noble clerk, Þat mykyl can off Goddys werk; In þe world is non hys pere. And also be Stane my way I drow?; Wiþ Egeland I spak inow?, And with þe countesse so clere. Þey fare weel, is nou?t to layne, And boþe here sones.’ Þe king was fayne, And in his herte made glad chere. 11 ‘Sere kyng,’ he sayde, ‘?iff it be þi wille, To chaumbyr þat þou woldest wenden tylle, Counsayl for to here, I schal þe telle a swete tydande, Þer comen neuere non swyche in þis lande Off al þis hundryd ?ere.’ Þe kyngys herte þan was ful woo Wiþ þat traytour for to goo; Þey wente boþe forþ in fere; And whenne þat þey were þe chaumbyr withinne, False lesyngys he gan begynne On hys weddyd broþer dere. 12 ‘Sere kyng,’ he sayde, ‘woo were me, Ded þat I scholde see þe, So moot I haue my lyff; For by hym þat al þis worl wan, Þou hast makyd me a man, And iholpe me for to þryff. For in þy land, sere, is a fals traytour; He wole doo þe mykyl dyshonour, And brynge þe on lyue; He wole deposen þe slyly, Sodaynly þan schalt þou dy, Be Crystys woundys fyue.’ 13 Þenne sayde þe kyng: ‘So moot þou the, Knowe I þat man, and I hym see? His name þou me telle.’ ‘Nay,’ says þat traytour, ‘þat wole I nou?t, For al þe gold þat euere was wrou?t— Be masse-book and belle— But ?iff þou me þy trowþe wil ply?t, Þat þou schalt neuere bewreye þe kny?t, Þat þe þe tale schal telle.’ Þanne þe kyng his hand vp rau?te, Þat false man his trowþe betau?te; He was a deuyl off helle! 14 ‘Sere kyng,’ he sayde, ‘þou madyst me kny?t, And now þou hast þy trowþe me ply?t Oure counsayl for to layne: Sertaynly, it is non oþir But Egelane, þy weddyd broþir— He wolde þat þou were slayne; He dos þy sustyr to vndyrstande He wole be kyng off þy lande, And þus he begynnes here trayne; He wole þe poysoun ry?t slyly, Sodaynly þanne schalt þou dy, Be hym þat suffryd payne.’ 15 Þanne swoor þe kyng be cros and roode: ‘Meete ne drynk schal do me goode, Tyl þat he be dede; Boþe he and hys wyff, hys soones twoo, Schole þey neuere be no moo In Yngelond on þat stede.’ ‘Nay,’ says þe traytour, ‘so moot I the, Ded wole I nou?t my broþer se; But do þy beste rede.’ No lengere þere þen wolde he lende: He takes hys leue, to Douere gan wende. God geue hym schame and dede! 16 Now is þat traytour hom iwent. A messanger was afftyr sent To speke with þe kyng. I wene he bar his owne name: He was hoten Athelstane; He was foundelyng. Þe lettrys were imaad fullyche þare, Vnto Stane for to fare Wiþouten ony dwellyng, To fette þe eerl and his sones twoo, And þe countasse alsoo, Dame Edyue, þat swete þyng. 17 And in þe lettre ?it was it tolde, Þat þe kyng þe eerlys sones wolde Make hem boþe kny?t; And þerto his seel he sette. Þe messanger wolde nou?t lette, Þe way he rydes ful ry?t. 18 Þe messanger, þe noble man, Takes hys hors and forþ he wan, And hyes a ful good spede. Þe eerl in hys halle he fande; He took hym þe lettre in his hande, Anon he bad hym rede: ‘Sere,’ he sayde also swyþe, ‘Þis lettre ou?te to make þe blyþe: Þertoo þou take good hede. Þe kyng wole for þe cuntas sake Boþe þy sones kny?tes make— To London I rede þe spede. 19 ‘Þe kyng wole for þe cuntas sake Boþe þy sones kny?tys make, Þe blyþere þou may be. Þy fayre wyff with þe þou bryng— And þer be ry?t no lettyng— Þat sy?te þat sche may see.’ Þenne sayde þat eerl with herte mylde: ‘My wyff goþ ry?t gret with chylde, And forþynkes me, Sche may nou?t out off chaumbyr wyn, To speke with non ende off here kyn, Tyl sche delyueryd be.’ 20 But into chaumbyr þey gunne wende, To rede þe lettrys before þat hende, And tydyngys tolde here soone. Þenne sayde þe cuntasse: ‘So moot I the, I wil nou?t lette tyl I þere be, Tomorwen or it be noone. 21 ‘To see hem kny?tys, my sones fre, I wole nou?t lette tyl I þere be: I schal no lengere dwelle. Cryst for?elde my lord þe kyng, Þat has grauntyd hem here dubbyng; Myn herte is gladyd welle.’ 22 Þe eerl hys men bad make hem ?are; He and hys wyff forþ gunne þey fare, To London faste þey wente. At Westemynstyr was þe kyngys wone; Þere þey mette with Athelstone, Þat afftyr hem hadde sente. 23 Þe goode eerl soone was hent, And feteryd faste, verrayment, And hys sones twoo. Ful lowde þe countasse gan to crye, And sayde: ‘Goode broþir, mercy! Why wole ?e vs sloo? What haue we a?ens ?ow done, Þat ?e wole haue vs ded so soone? Me þynkiþ ?e arn oure foo.’ Þe kyng as wood ferde in þat stede; He garte hys sustyr to presoun lede— In herte he was ful woo. 24 Þenne a squyer, was þe countasses frende, To þe qwene he gan wende, And tydyngys tolde here soone. Gerlondes off chyryes off sche caste, Into þe halle sche come at þe laste, Longe or it were noone. ‘Sere kyng, I am before þe come Wiþ a chyld, dou?tyr or a sone; Graunte me my bone, My broþir and sustyr þat I may borwe, Tyl þe nexte day at morwe, Out off here paynys stronge; 25 ‘Þat we mowe wete be comoun sent In þe playne parlement...’ ‘Dame,’ he sayde, ‘goo fro me; Þy bone schal nou?t igrauntyd be, I doo þe to vndyrstande. For, be hym þat weres þe corowne off þorn, Þey schole be drawen and hangyd tomorn, ?yff I be kyng off lande.’ 26 And whenne þe qwene þese wurdes herde, As sche hadde be beten wiþ ?erde, Þe teeres sche leet doun falle. Sertaynly, as I ?ow telle, On here bare knees doun sche felle, And prayde ?it for hem alle. ‘A, dame,’ he sayde, ‘verrayment, Hast þou broke my comaundement? Abyyd ful dere þou schalle.’ Wiþ hys foot (he wolde nou?t wonde) He slow? þe chyld ry?t in here wombe: Sche swownyd amonges hem alle. 27 Ladyys and maydenys þat þere were, Þe qwene to here chaumbyr bere, And þere was dool inow?. Soone withinne a lytyl spase A knaue-chyld iborn þer wase, As bry?t as blosme on bow?. He was boþe whyt and red; Off þat dynt was he ded— Hys owne fadyr hym slow?. Þus may a traytour baret rayse, And make manye men ful euele at ayse, Hymselff nou?t afftyr it low?. 28 But ?it þe qwene, as ?e schole here, Sche callyd vpon a messangere, Bad hym a lettre fonge, And bad hym wende to Cauntyrbery, Þere þe clerkys syngen mery Boþe masse and euensonge. ‘Þis lettre þou þe bysschop take, And praye hym for Goddys sake Come borewe hem out off here bande. He wole doo more for hym, I wene, Þanne for me, þou? I be qwene— I doo þe to vndyrstande. 29 ‘An eerldom in Spayne I haue of land; Al I sese into þyn hand, Trewely, as I þe hy?t, An hundryd besauntys off gold red. Þou may saue hem from þe ded, ?yff þat þyn hors be wy?t.’ ‘Madame, brouke weel þy moregeue, Also longe as þou may leue: Þerto haue I no ry?t; But off þy gold and off þy fee, Cryst in heuene for?elde it þe; I wole be þere tony?t. 30 ‘Madame, þrytty myles off hard way I haue reden, siþ it was day: Ful sore I gan me swynke; And for to ryde now fyue and twenti þertoo, An hard þyng it were to doo, Forsoþe, ry?t as me þynke. Madame, it is nerhande passyd prime, And me behoues al for to dyne, Boþe wyn and ale to drynke. Whenne I have dynyd, þenne wole I fare. God may couere hem off here care, Or þat I slepe a wynke.’ 31 Whenne he hadde dynyd, he wente his way, Also faste as þat he may, He rod be Charynge-cros, And entryd into Flete-strete, And seþþyn þorw? Londone, I ?ow hete, Vpon a noble hors. Þe messanger, þat noble man, On Loundone-brygge sone he wan— For his trauayle he hadde no los— From Stone into Steppyngebourne, Forsoþe his way nolde he nou?t tourne; Sparyd he nou?t for myre ne mos. 32 And þus hys way wendes he Fro Osprynge to þe Blee. Þenne my?te he see þe toun Off Cauntyrbery, þat noble wyke, Þerin lay þat bysschop ryke, Þat lord off gret renoun. 33 And whenne þey runggen vndernbelle, He rod in Londone, as I ?ow telle: He was non er redy; And ?it to Cauntyrbery he wan, Longe or euensong began; He rod mylys fyffty. 34 Þe messanger noþyng abod; Into þe palays forþ he rod, Þere þat þe bysschop was inne. Ry?t welcome was þe messanger, Þat was come from þe qwene so cleer, Was off so noble kynne. He took hym a lettre ful good speed, And sayde: ‘Sere bysschop, haue þis and reed’; And bad hym come wiþ hym. Or he þe lettre hadde halff iredde, For dool, hym þou?te, hys herte bledde; Þe teeres fyl ouyr hys chyn. 35 Þe bysschop bad sadele hys palfray: ‘Also faste as þay may, Bydde my men make hem ?are; And wendes before,’ þe bysschop dede say, ‘To my maneres in þe way; For noþyng þat ?e spare, And loke, at ylke fyue mylys ende A fresch hors þat I fynde, Schod and noþyng bare; Blyþe schal I neuere be, Tyl I my weddyd broþer see, To keuere hym out off care.’ 36 On nyne palfrays þe bysschop sprong, Ar it was day, from euensong— In romaunce as we rede. Sertaynly, as I ?ow telle, On Londone-brygge ded doun felle Þe messangeres stede. ‘Allas,’ he sayde, ‘þat I was born! Now is my goode hors forlorn, Was good at ylke a nede; ?istyrday vpon þe grounde, He was wurþ an hundryd pounde, Ony kyng to lede.’ 37 Þenne bespak þe erchebysschop, Oure gostly fadyr vndyr God, Vnto þe messangere: ‘Lat be þy menyng off þy stede, And þynk vpon oure mykyl nede, Þe whylys þat we ben here; For ?iff þat I may my broþer borwe, And bryngen hym out off mekyl sorwe, Þou may make glad chere; And þy warysoun I schal þe geue, And God haue grauntyd þe to leue Vnto an hundryd ?ere.’ 38 Þe bysschop þenne nou?t ne bod: He took hys hors, and forþ he rod Into Westemynstyr so ly?t; Þe messanger on his foot alsoo: Wiþ þe bysschop come no moo, Neþer squyer ne kny?t. Vpon þe morwen þe kyng aros, And takes þe way, to þe kyrke he gos, As man off mekyl my?t. Wiþ hym wente boþe preest and clerk, Þat mykyl cowde off Goddys werk, To praye God for þe ry?t. 39 Whenne þat he to þe kyrke com; Tofore þe rode he knelyd anon, And on hys knees he felle: ‘God, þat syt in Trynyte, A bone þat þou graunte me, Lord, as þou harewyd helle— Gyltles men ?iff þat þay be, Þat are in my presoun free, Forcursyd þere to ?elle, Off þe gylt and þay be clene, Leue it moot on hem be sene, Þat garte hem þere to dwelle.’ 40 And whenne he hadde maad his prayer, He lokyd vp into þe qweer; Þe erchebysschop saw? he stande. He was forwondryd off þat caas, And to hym he wente apas, And took hym be þe hande. ‘Welcome’, he sayde, ‘þou erchebysschop, Oure gostly fadyr vndyr God.’ He swoor be God leuande: ‘Weddyd broþer, weel moot þou spede, For I hadde neuere so mekyl nede, Siþ I took cros on hande. 41 ‘Goode weddyd broþer, now turne þy rede; Doo nou?t þyn owne blood to dede, But ?iff it wurþy were. For hym þat weres þe corowne off þorn, Lat me borwe hem tyl tomorn, Þat we mowe enquere, And weten alle be comoun asent In þe playne parlement... 42 ‘Who is wurþy be schent. And, but ?iff ?e wole graunte my bone, It schal vs rewe boþe or none, Be God þat alle þyng lent.’ 43 Þanne þe kyng wax wroþ as wynde, A wodere man my?te no man fynde Þan he began to bee: He swoor oþis be sunne and mone: ‘Þey schole be drawen and hongyd or none— Wiþ eyen þou schalt see. Lay doun þy cros and þy staff, Þy mytyr and þy ryng þat I þe gaff; Out off my land þou flee! Hy?e þe faste out off my sy?t; Wher I þe mete, þy deþ is dy?t; Non oþir þen schal it bee.’ 44 Þenne bespak þat erchebysschop, Oure gostly fadyr vndyr God, Smertly to þe kyng: ‘Weel I wot þat þou me gaff Boþe þe cros and þe staff, Þe mytyr and eke þe ryng; My bysschopryche þou reues me, And crystyndom forbede I þe: Preest schal þer non syngge; Neyþer maydynchyld ne knaue Crystyndom schal þer non haue; To care I schal þe brynge. 45 ‘I schal gare crye þorw? ylke a toun Þat kyrkys schole be broken doun, And stoken agayn wiþ þorn. And þou schalt lygge in an old dyke, As it were an heretyke. Allas, þat þou were born! 46 ‘?iff þou be ded, þat I may see, Asoylyd schalt þou neuere bee; Þanne is þy soule in sorwe. And I schal wenden in vncouþe lond, And gete me stronge men of hond; My broþir ?it schal I borwe. I schal brynge vpon þy lond Hungyr and þyrst ful strong, Cold, drou?þe, and sorwe; I schal nou?t leue on þy lond Wurþ þe gloues on þy hond, To begge ne to borwe.’ 47 Þe bysschop has his leue tan. By þat his men were comen ylkan: Þey sayden: ‘Sere, haue good day.’ He entryd into Flete-strete; Wiþ lordys off Yngelond gan he mete Vpon a nobyl aray. On here knees þey kneleden adoun, And prayden hym off hys benysoun; He nykkyd hem wiþ nay. Neyþer off cros neyþer off ryng Hadde þey non kyns wetyng; And þanne a kny?t gan say. 48 A kny?t þanne spak with mylde voys: ‘Sere, where is þy ryng? where is þy croys? Is it fro þe tan?’ Þanne he sayde: ‘?oure cursyd kyng Haþ me refft off al my þyng, And off al my worldly wan; And I haue entyrdytyd Yngelond: Þer schal no preest synge masse with hond, Chyld schal be crystenyd non; But ?iff he graunte me þat kny?t, His wyff and chyldryn fayr and bry?t: He wolde with wrong hem slon.’ 49 Þe kny?t sayde: ‘Bysschop, turne agayn; Off þy body we are ful fayn; Þy broþir ?it schole we borwe. And, but he graunte vs oure bone, Hys presoun schal be broken soone, Hymselff to mekyl sorwe. We schole drawe doun boþe halle and boures; Boþe hys castelles and hys toures, Þey schole lygge lowe and holewe. Þou? he be kyng and were þe corown, We scholen hym sette in a deep dunioun: Oure crystyndom we wole folewe.’ 50 Þanne, as þey spoken off þis þyng, Þer comen twoo kny?tys from þe kyng, And sayden: ‘Bysschop, abyde, And haue þy cros and þy ryng, And welcome, whyl þat þou wylt lyng, It is nou?t for to hyde— Here he grauntys þe þe kny?t, Hys wyff and chyldryn fayr and bry?t; Again I rede þou ryde. He prayes þe pur charyte Þat he my?te asoylyd be, And Yngelond long and wyde.’ 51 Hereoff þe bysschop was ful fayn, And turnys hys brydyl and wendes agayn— Barouns gunne wiþ hym ryde— Vnto þe Brokene-Cros off ston; Þedyr com þe kyng ful soone anon, And þere he gan abyde. Vpon hys knees he knelyd adoun, And prayde þe bysschop off benysoun; And he gaff hym þat tyde. Wiþ holy watyr and orysoun, He asoylyd þe kyng þat weryd þe coroun, And Yngelond long and wyde. 52 Þenne sayde þe kyng anon ry?t: ‘Here I graunte þe þat kny?t, And hys sones free, And my sustyr hende in halle. Þou hast sauyd here lyuys alle: Iblessyd moot þou bee.’ Þenne sayde þe bysschop also soone: ‘And I schal geuen swylke a dome— Wiþ eyen þat þou schalt see— ?iff þay be gylty off þat dede, Sorrere þe doome þay may drede, Þan schewe here schame to me. 53 Whanne þe bysschop hadde sayd soo, A gret fyr was maad ry?t þoo, In romaunce as we rede— It was set, þat men my?te knawe, Nyne plow?-lengþe on rawe, As red as ony glede. Þanne sayde þe kyng: ‘What may þis mene?’ ‘Sere, off gylt and þay be clene, Þis doom hem thar nou?t drede.’ Þanne sayde þe good kyng Athelston: ‘An hard doome now is þis on: God graunte vs alle weel to spede!’ 54 Þey fetten forþ sere Egelan— A trewere eerl was þer nan— Before þe fyr so bry?t. From hym þey token þe rede scarlet, Boþe hosyn and schoon þat weren hym met, Þat fel al for a kny?t. Nyne syþe þe bysschop halewid þe way, Þat his weddyd broþer scholde goo þat day, To praye God for þe ry?t. He was vnblemeschyd foot and hand; Þat saw? þe lordes off þe land, And þankyd God off hys my?t. 55 Þey offeryd hym with mylde chere Vnto seynt Powlys hey?e awtere, Þat mekyl was off my?t. Doun vpon hys knees he felle, And þankyd God þat harewede helle, And hys modyr so bry?t. 56 And ?it þe bysschop þo gan say: ‘Now schal þe chyldryn gon þe way Þat þe fadyr ?ede.’ Fro hem þey tooke þe rede scarlete, Þe hosen and schoon þat weren hem mete, And al here worldly wede. Þe fyr was boþe hydous and red, Þe chyldryn swownyd as þey were ded; Þe bysschop tyl hem ?ede; Wiþ careful herte on hem gan look; Be hys hand he hem vp took: ‘Chyldryn, haue ?e no drede.’ 57 Þanne þe chyldryn stood and low?: ‘Sere, þe fyr is cold inow?.’ Þorw?out þey wente apase. Þey weren vnblemeschyd foot and hand: Þat saw? þe lordys off þe land, And þankyd God off his grace. 58 Þey offeryd hem with mylde chere To seynt Poulys hy?e awtere; Þis myracle schewyd was þere. And ?it þe bysschop efft gan say: ‘Now schal þe countasse goo þe way, Þere þat þe chyldryn were.’ 59 Þey fetten forþ þe lady mylde; Sche was ful gret igon with chylde, In romaunce as we rede— Before þe fyr when þat sche come, To Iesu Cryst he prayde a bone, Þat leet his woundys blede: ‘Now, God, lat neuere þe kyngys foo Quyk out off þe fyr goo.’ Þeroff hadde sche no drede. 60 Whenne sche hadde maad here prayer, Sche was brou?t before þe feer, Þat brennyd boþe fayr and ly?t. Sche wente fro þe lengþe into þe þrydde; Stylle sche stood þe fyr amydde, And callyd it merye and bry?t. Harde schourys þenne took here stronge Boþe in bak and eke in wombe; And siþþen it fel at sy?t. 61 Whenne þat here paynys slakyd was, And sche hadde passyd þat hydous pas, Here nose barst on bloode. Sche was vnblemeschyd foot and hand: Þat saw? þe lordys off þe land, And þankyd God on rode. Þey comaundyd men here away to drawe, As it was þe landys lawe; And ladyys þanne tyl here ?ode. Sche knelyd doun vpon þe ground, And þere was born seynt Edemound: Iblessyd be þat foode! 62 And whanne þis chyld iborn was, It was brou?t into þe plas; It was boþe hool and sound. Boþe þe kyng and bysschop free Þey crystnyd þe chyld, þat men my?t see, And callyd it Edemound. ‘Halff my land,’ he sayde, ‘I þe geue, Also longe as I may leue, Wiþ markys and with pounde, And al afftyr my dede— Yngelond to wysse and rede.’ Now iblessyd be þat stounde! 63 Þenne sayde þe bysschop to þe kyng: ‘Sere, who made þis grete lesyng, And who wrou?te al þis bale?’ Þanne sayde þe kyng: ‘So moot I thee, Þat schalt þou neuere wete for me, In burgh neyþer in sale; For I haue sworn be seynt Anne Þat I schal neuere bewreye þat manne, Þat me gan telle þat tale. Þey arn sauyd þorw? þy red; Now lat al þis be ded, And kepe þis counseyl hale.’ 64 Þenne swoor þe bysschop: ‘So moot I the, Now I haue power and dignyte For to asoyle þe as clene As þou were houen off þe fount-ston; Trustly trowe þou þervpon, And holde it for no wene: I swere boþe be book and belle, But ?iff þou me his name telle, Þe ry?t doom schal I deme: Þyselff schalt goo þe ry?te way Þat þy broþer wente today, Þou? it þe euele beseme.’ 65 Þenne sayde þe kyng: ‘So moot I the, Be schryffte off mouþe telle I it þe, Þerto I am vnblyue— Sertaynly, it is non oþir But Wymound, oure weddyd broþer; He wole neuere þryue.’ ‘Allas,’ sayde þe bysschop þan, ‘I wende he were þe treweste man, Þat euere ?it leuyd on lyue. And he wiþ þis ateynt may bee, He schal be hongyd on trees þree, And drawen with hors fyue.’ 66 And whenne þat þe bysschop þe soþe hade Þat þat traytour þat lesyng made, He callyd a messangere, Bad hym to Douere þat he scholde founde, For to fette þat eerl Wymounde: (Þat traytour has no pere!) ‘Sere Egelane and hys sones be slawe, Boþe ihangyd and to-drawe. (Doo as I þe lere!) Þe countasse is in presoun done; Schal sche neuere out off presoun come, But ?iff it be on bere.’ 67 Now wiþ þe messanger was no badde; He took his hors, as þe bysschop radde, To Douere tyl þat he come. Þe eerl in hys halle he fand: He took hym þe lettre in his hand On hy?, wolde he nou?t wone: ‘Sere Egelane and his sones be slawe, Boþe ihangyd and to-drawe: Þou getyst þat eerldome. Þe countasse is in presoun done; Schal sche neuere more out come, Ne see neyþer sunne ne mone.’ 68 Þanne þat eerl made hym glade, And þankyd God þat lesyng was made: ‘It haþ gete me þis eerldome.’ He sayde: ‘Felawe, ry?t weel þou bee! Haue here besauntys good plente For þyn hedyr-come.’ Þanne þe messanger made his mon: ‘Sere, off ?oure goode hors lende me on: Now graunte me my bone; For ?ystyrday deyde my nobyl stede, On ?oure arende as I ?ede, Be þe way as I come.’ 69 ‘Myn hors be fatte and cornfed, And off þy lyff I am adred,’ Þat eerl sayde to hym þan; ‘Þanne ?iff myn hors scholde þe sloo, My lord þe kyng wolde be ful woo To lese swylk a man.’ 70 Þe messanger ?it he brou?te a stede, On off þe beste at ylke a nede, Þat euere on grounde dede gange, Sadelyd and brydelyd at þe beste. Þe messanger was ful preste, Wy?tly on hym he sprange. ‘Sere,’ he sayde, ‘haue good day; Þou schalt come whan þou may; I schal make þe kyng at hande.’ With sporys faste he strook þe stede; To Grauysende he come good spede, Is fourty myle to fande. 71 Þere þe messanger þe traytour abood, And seþþyn boþe insame þey rod To Westemynstyr wone. In þe palays þere þay ly?t; Into þe halle þey come ful ry?t, And mette wiþ Athelstone. He wolde haue kyssyd his lord swete. He sayde: ‘Traytour, nou?t ?it! lete! Be God and be seynt Jhon, For þy falsnesse and þy lesyng I slow? myn heyr, scholde haue ben kyng, When my lyf hadde ben gon.’ 72 Þere he denyyd faste þe kyng, Þat he made neuere þat lesyng, Among hys peres alle. Þe bysschop has hym be þe hand tan; Forþ insame þey are gan Into þe wyde halle. My?te he neuere with crafft ne gynne, Gare hym schryuen off hys synne, For nou?t þat my?te befalle. Þenne sayde þe goode kyng Athelston: ‘Lat hym to þe fyr gon, To preue þe treweþe wiþ alle.’ 73 Whenne þe kyng hadde sayd soo, A gret fyr was maad þoo, In romaunce as we rede— It was set, þat men my?ten knawe, Nyne plow?-lenge on rawe, As red as ony glede. Nyne syþis þe bysschop halewes þe way, Þat þat traytour schole goo þat day: Þe wers hym gan to spede. He wente fro þe lengþe into þe þrydde, And doun he fel þe fyr amydde: Hys eyen wolde hym nou?t lede. 74 Þan þe eerlys chyldryn were war ful smerte, And wy?tly to þe traytour sterte, And out off þe fyr hym hade; And sworen boþe be book and belle: ‘Or þat þou deye, þou schalt telle Why þou þat lesyng made.’ ‘Certayn, I can non oþer red, Now I wot I am but ded: I telle ?ow noþyng gladde— Certayn, þer was non oþer wyte: He louyd hym to mekyl and me to lyte; Þerfore enuye I hadde.’ 75 Whenne þat traytour so hadde sayde, Fyue good hors to hym were tayde, Alle men my?ten see wiþ y?e— Þey drowen hym þorw? ylke a strete, And seþþyn to þe Elmes, I ?ow hete, And hongyd hym ful hy?e. Was þer neuere man so hardy, Þat durste felle hys false body: Þis hadde he for hys lye. Now Iesu, þat is heuene-kyng, Leue neuere traytour haue betere endyng, But swych dome for to dye.
