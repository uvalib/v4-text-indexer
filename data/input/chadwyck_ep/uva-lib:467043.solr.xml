      <field name="fulltext">PART I LYRICAL POETRY VERSES IN PREFACE: FOR ADELAIDE To you, who are my verses, as on some very future day, if you ever care to read them, you will understand, would it not be somewhat trivial to dedicate any one verse, as I may do, in all humility, to my friends? Trivial, too, perhaps, only to name you even here? Trivial, presumptuous? For I need not write your name for you at least to know that this and all my work is made for you in the first place, and I need not to be reminded by my critics that I have no silver tongue such as were fit to praise you. So for once you shall go indedicate, if not quite anonymous; and I will only commend my little book to you in sentences far beyond my poor compass which will help you perhaps to be kind to it: ‘Votre personne, vos moindres mouvements me semblaient avoir dans le monde une importance extra-humaine. Mon cœur comme de la poussière se soulevait derrière vos pas. Vous me faisiez l'effet d'un clair-de-lune par une nuit d'été, quand tout est parfums, ombres douces, blancheurs, infini; et les délices de la chair et de l'âme étaient contenues pour moi dans votre nom que je me répétais en tachant de le baiser sur mes lèvres. ‘Quelquefois vos paroles me reviennent comme un écho lointain, comme le son d'une cloche apporté par le vent; et il me semble que vous êtes là quand je lis des passages de l'amour dans les livres.... Tout ce qu'on y blâme d'exagéré, vous me l'avez fait ressentir.’ Pont-Aven, Finistère, 1896. Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat incohare longam. They are not long, the weeping and the laughter, Love and desire and hate: I think they have no portion in us after We pass the gate. They are not long, the days of wine and roses: Out of a misty dream Our path emerges for a while, then closes Within a dream. A CORONAL With His songs and Her days to His Lady and to Love Violets and leaves of vine, Into a frail, fair wreath We gather and entwine: A wreath for Love to wear, Fragrant as his own breath, To crown his brow divine, All day till night is near. Violets and leaves of vine We gather and entwine. Violets and leaves of vine For Love that lives a day, We gather and entwine. All day till Love is dead, Till eve falls, cold and gray, These blossoms, yours and mine, Love wears upon his head. Violets and leaves of vine We gather and entwine. Violets and leaves of vine, For Love when poor Love dies We gather and entwine. This wreath that lives a day Over his pale, cold eyes, Kissed shut by Proserpine, At set of sun we lay: Violets and leaves of vine We gather and entwine. NUNS OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION For The Countess Sobieska von Platt Calm, sad, secure; behind high convent walls, These watch the sacred lamp, these watch and pray: And it is one with them when evening falls, And one with them the cold return of day. These heed not time; their nights and days they make Into a long, returning rosary, Whereon their lives are threaded for Christ's sake: Meekness and vigilance and chastity. A vowed patrol, in silent companies, Life-long they keep before the living Christ: In the dim church, their prayers and penances Are fragrant incense to the Sacrificed. Outside, the world is wild and passionate; Man's weary laughter and his sick despair Entreat at their impenetrable gate: They heed no voices in their dream of prayer. They saw the glory of the world displayed; They saw the bitter of it, and the sweet; They knew the roses of the world should fade, And be trod under by the hurrying feet. Therefore they rather put away desire, And crossed their hands and came to sanctuary; And veiled their heads and put on coarse attire: Because their comeliness was vanity. And there they rest; they have serene insight Of the illuminating dawn to be: Mary's sweet Star dispels for them the night, The proper darkness of humanity. Calm, sad, secure; with faces worn and mild: Surely their choice of vigil is the best? Yea! for our roses fade, the world is wild; But there, beside the altar, there, is rest. VILLANELLE OF SUNSET Come hither, Child! and rest: This is the end of day, Behold the weary West! Sleep rounds with equal zest Man's toil and children's play: Come hither, Child! and rest. My white bird, seek thy nest, Thy drooping head down lay: Behold the weary West! Now are the flowers confest Of slumber: sleep, as they! Come hither, Child! and rest. Now eve is manifest, And homeward lies our way: Behold the weary West! Tired flower! upon my breast, I would wear thee alway: Come hither, Child! and rest; Behold, the weary West! MY LADY APRIL For Léopold Nelken Dew on her robe and on her tangled hair; Twin dewdrops for her eyes; behold her pass, With dainty step brushing the young, green grass, The while she trills some high, fantastic air, Full of all feathered sweetness: she is fair, And all her flower-like beauty, as a glass, Mirrors out hope and love: and still, alas! Traces of tears her languid lashes wear. Say, doth she weep for very wantonness? Or is it that she dimly doth foresee Across her youth the joys grow less and less, The burden of the days that are to be: Autumn and withered leaves and vanity, And winter bringing end in barrenness. TO ONE IN BEDLAM For Henry Davray With delicate, mad hands, behind his sordid bars, Surely he hath his posies, which they tear and twine; Those scentless wisps of straw, that miserably line His strait, caged universe, whereat the dull world stares, Pedant and pitiful. O, how his rapt gaze wars With their stupidity! Know they what dreams divine Lift his long, laughing reveries like enchaunted wine, And make his melancholy germane to the stars'? O lamentable brother! if those pity thee, Am I not fain of all thy lone eyes promise me; Half a fool's kingdom, far from men who sow and reap, All their days, vanity? Better than mortal flowers, Thy moon-kissed roses seem: better than love or sleep, The star-crowned solitude of thine oblivious hours! AD DOMNULAM SUAM Little lady of my heart! Just a little longer, Love me: we will pass and part, Ere this love grow stronger. I have loved thee, Child! too well, To do aught but leave thee: Nay! my lips should never tell Any tale, to grieve thee. Little lady of my heart! Just a little longer, I may love thee: we will part, Ere my love grow stronger. Soon thou leavest fairy-land; Darker grow thy tresses: Soon no more of hand in hand; Soon no more caresses! Little lady of my heart! Just a little longer, Be a child: then, we will part, Ere this love grow stronger. AMOR UMBRATILIS A gift of Silence, sweet! Who may not ever hear: To lay down at your unobservant feet, Is all the gift I bear. I have no songs to sing, That you should heed or know: I have no lilies, in full hands, to fling Across the path you go. I cast my flowers away, Blossoms unmeet for you! The garland I have gathered in my day: My rosemary and rue. I watch you pass and pass, Serene and cold: I lay My lips upon your trodden, daisied grass, And turn my life away. Yea, for I cast you, sweet! This one gift, you shall take: Like ointment, on your unobservant feet, My silence, for your sake. AMOR PROFANUS For Gabriel de Lautrec Beyond the pale of memory, In some mysterious dusky grove; A place of shadows utterly, Where never coos the turtle-dove, A world forgotten of the sun: I dreamed we met when day was done, And marvelled at our ancient love. Met there by chance, long kept apart, We wandered, through the darkling glades; And that old language of the heart We sought to speak: alas! poor shades! Over our pallid lips had run The waters of oblivion, Which crown all loves of men or maids. In vain we stammered: from afar Our old desire shone cold and dead: That time was distant as a star, When eyes were bright and lips were red. And still we went with downcast eye And no delight in being nigh, Poor shadows most uncomforted. Ah, Lalage! while life is ours, Hoard not thy beauty rose and white, But pluck the pretty, fleeting flowers That deck our little path of light: For all too soon we twain shall tread The bitter pastures of the dead: Estranged, sad spectres of the night. VILLANELLE OF MARGUERITES For Miss Eugénie Magnus ‘A little, passionately, not at all?’ She casts the snowy petals on the air: And what care we how many petals fall! Nay, wherefore seek the seasons to forestall? It is but playing, and she will not care, A little, passionately, not at all! She would not answer us if we should call Across the years: her visions are too fair; And what care we how many petals fall! She knows us not, nor recks if she enthrall With voice and eyes and fashion of her hair, A little, passionately, not at all! Knee-deep she goes in meadow grasses tall, Kissed by the daisies that her fingers tear: And what care we how many petals fall! We pass and go: but she shall not recall What men we were, nor all she made us bear: ‘A little, passionately, not at all!’ And what care we how many petals fall! YVONNE OF BRITTANY For Marmaduke Langdale In your mother's apple-orchard, Just a year ago, last spring: Do you remember, Yvonne! The dear trees lavishing Rain of their starry blossoms To make you a coronet? Do you ever remember, Yvonne? As I remember yet. In your mother's apple-orchard, When the world was left behind: You were shy, so shy, Yvonne! But your eyes were calm and kind. We spoke of the apple harvest, When the cider press is set, And such-like trifles, Yvonne! That doubtless you forget. In the still, soft Breton twilight, We were silent; words were few, Till your mother came out chiding, For the grass was bright with dew: But I know your heart was beating, Like a fluttered, frightened dove. Do you ever remember, Yvonne? That first faint flush of love? In the fulness of midsummer, When the apple-bloom was shed, Oh, brave was your surrender, Though shy the words you said. I was glad, so glad, Yvonne! To have led you home at last; Do you ever remember, Yvonne! How swiftly the days passed? In your mother's apple-orchard It is grown too dark to stray, There is none to chide you, Yvonne! You are over far away. There is dew on your grave grass, Yvonne! But your feet it shall not wet: No, you never remember, Yvonne! And I shall soon forget. BENEDICTIO DOMINI For Selwyn Image Without, the sullen noises of the street! The voice of London, inarticulate, Hoarse and blaspheming, surges in to meet The silent blessing of the Immaculate. Dark is the church, and dim the worshippers, Hushed with bowed heads as though by some old spell, While through the incense-laden air there stirs The admonition of a silver bell. Dark is the church, save where the altar stands, Dressed like a bride, illustrious with light, Where one old priest exalts with tremulous hands The one true solace of man's fallen plight. Strange silence here: without, the sounding street Heralds the world's swift passage to the fire: O Benediction, perfect and complete! When shall men cease to suffer and desire? GROWTH I watched the glory of her childhood change, Half-sorrowful to find the child I knew, (Loved long ago in lily-time) Become a maid, mysterious and strange, With fair, pure eyes—dear eyes, but not the eyes I knew Of old, in the olden time! Till on my doubting soul the ancient good Of her dear childhood in the new disguise Dawned, and I hastened to adore The glory of her waking maidenhood, And found the old tenderness within her deepening eyes, But kinder than before. AD MANUS PUELLAE For Leonard Smithers I was always a lover of ladies' hands! Or ever mine heart came here to tryst, For the sake of your carved white hands' commands; The tapering fingers, the dainty wrist; The hands of a girl were what I kissed. I remember an hand like a fleur-de-lys When it slid from its silken sheath, her glove; With its odours passing ambergris: And that was the empty husk of a love. Oh, how shall I kiss your hands enough? They are pale with the pallor of ivories; But they blush to the tips like a curled sea-shell: What treasure, in kingly treasuries, Of gold, and spice for the thurible, Is sweet as her hands to hoard and tell? I know not the way from your finger-tips, Nor how I shall gain the higher lands, The citadel of your sacred lips: I am captive still of my pleasant bands, The hands of a girl, and most your hands. FLOS LUNAE For Yvanhoé Rambosson I would not alter thy cold eyes, Nor trouble the calm fount of speech With aught of passion or surprise. The heart of thee I cannot reach: I would not alter thy cold eyes! I would not alter thy cold eyes; Nor have thee smile, nor make thee weep: Though all my life droops down and dies, Desiring thee, desiring sleep, I would not alter thy cold eyes. I would not alter thy cold eyes; I would not change thee if I might, To whom my prayers for incense rise, Daughter of dreams! my moon of night! I would not alter thy cold eyes. I would not alter thy cold eyes, With trouble of the human heart: Within their glance my spirit lies, A frozen thing, alone, apart; I would not alter thy cold eyes. NON SUM QUALIS ERAM BONAE SUB REGNO CYNARAE Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine; And I was desolate and sick of an old passion, Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head: I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion. All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat, Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay; Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet; But I was desolate and sick of an old passion, When I awoke and found the dawn was gray: I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion. I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind, Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng, Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind; But I was desolate and sick of an old passion, Yea, all the time, because the dance was long: I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion. I cried for madder music and for stronger wine, But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire, Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine; And I am desolate and sick of an old passion, Yea hungry for the lips of my desire: I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion. VANITAS For Vincent O'Sullivan Beyond the need of weeping, Beyond the reach of hands, May she be quietly sleeping, In what dim nebulous lands? Ah, she who understands! The long, long winter weather, These many years and days, Since she, and Death, together, Left me the wearier ways: And now, these tardy bays! The crown and victor's token: How are they worth to-day? The one word left unspoken, It were late now to say: But cast the palm away! For once, ah once, to meet her, Drop laurel from tired hands: Her cypress were the sweeter, In her oblivious lands: Haply she understands! Yet, crossed that weary river, In some ulterior land, Or anywhere, or ever, Will she stretch out a hand? And will she understand? EXILE For Conal Holmes O'Connell O'Riordan By the sad waters of separation Where we have wandered by divers ways, I have but the shadow and imitation Of the old memorial days. In music I have no consolation, No roses are pale enough for me; The sound of the waters of separation Surpasseth roses and melody. By the sad waters of separation Dimly I hear from an hidden place The sigh of mine ancient adoration: Hardly can I remember your face. If you be dead, no proclamation Sprang to me over the waste, gray sea: Living, the waters of separation Sever for ever your soul from me. No man knoweth our desolation; Memory pales of the old delight; While the sad waters of separation Bear us on to the ultimate night. SPLEEN For Arthur Symons I was not sorrowful, I could not weep, And all my memories were put to sleep. I watched the river grow more white and strange, All day till evening I watched it change. All day till evening I watched the rain Beat wearily upon the window pane. I was not sorrowful, but only tired Of everything that ever I desired. Her lips, her eyes, all day became to me The shadow of a shadow utterly. All day mine hunger for her heart became Oblivion, until the evening came, And left me sorrowful, inclined to weep, With all my memories that could not sleep. O MORS! QUAM AMARA EST MEMORIA TUA HOMINI PACEM HABENTI IN SUBSTANTIIS SUIS Exceeding sorrow Consumeth my sad heart! Because to-morrow We must depart, Now is exceeding sorrow All my part! Give over playing, Cast thy viol away: Merely laying Thine head my way: Prithee, give over playing, Grave or gay. Be no word spoken; Weep nothing:let a pale Silence, unbroken Silence prevail! Prithee, be no word spoken, Lest I fail! Forget to-morrow! Weep nothing: only lay In silent sorrow Thine head my way: Let us forget to-morrow, This one day! [You would have understood me, had you waited] Ah, dans ces mornes séjours Les jamais sont les toujours. Paul Verlaine You would have understood me, had you waited; I could have loved you, dear! as well as he: Had we not been impatient, dear! and fated Always to disagree. What is the use of speech? Silence were fitter: Lest we should still be wishing things unsaid. Though all the words we ever spake were bitter, Shall I reproach you dead? Nay, let this earth, your portion, likewise cover All the old anger, setting us apart: Always, in all, in truth was I your lover; Always, I held your heart. I have met other women who were tender, As you were cold, dear! with a grace as rare. Think you, I turned to them, or made surrender, I who had found you fair? Had we been patient, dear! ah, had you waited, I had fought death for you, better than he: But from the very first, dear! we were fated Always to disagree. Late, late, I come to you, now death discloses Love that in life was not to be our part: On your low lying mound between the roses, Sadly I cast my heart. I would not waken you: nay! this is fitter; Death and the darkness give you unto me; Here we who loved so, were so cold and bitter, Hardly can disagree. APRIL LOVE For Arthur Cecil Hillier We have walked in Love's land a little way, We have learnt his lesson a little while, And shall we not part at the end of day, With a sigh, a smile? A little while in the shine of the sun, We were twined together, joined lips, forgot How the shadows fall when the day is done, And when Love is not. We have made no vows—there will none be broke, Our love was free as the wind on the hill, There was no word said we need wish unspoke, We have wrought no ill. So shall we not part at the end of day, Who have loved and lingered a little while, Join lips for the last time, go our way, With a sigh, a smile? VAIN HOPE Sometimes, to solace my sad heart, I say, Though late it be, though lily-time be past, Though all the summer skies be overcast, Haply I will go down to her, some day, And cast my rests of life before her feet, That she may have her will of me, being so sweet, And none gainsay! So might she look on me with pitying eyes, And lay calm hands of healing on my head: ‘Because of thy long pains be comforted; For I, even I, am Love: sad soul, arise!’ So, for her graciousness, I might at last Gaze on the very face of Love, and hold Him fast In no disguise. Haply, I said, she will take pity on me, Though late I come, long after lily-time, With burden of waste days and drifted rhyme: Her kind, calm eyes, down drooping maidenly, Shall change, grow soft: there yet is time, meseems, I said, for solace; though I know these things are dreams And may not be! VAIN RESOLVES I said: ‘There is an end of my desire: Now have I sown, and I have harvested, And these are ashes of an ancient fire, Which, verily, shall not be quickened. Now will I take me to a place of peace, Forget mine heart's desire; In solitude and prayer, work out my soul's release. I shall forget her eyes, how cold they were; Forget her voice, how soft it was and low, With all my singing that she did not hear, And all my service that she did not know. I shall not hold the merest memory Of any days that were, Within those solitudes where I will fasten me.’ And once she passed, and once she raised her eyes, And smiled for courtesy, and nothing said: And suddenly the old flame did uprise, And all my dead desire was quickened. Yea! as it hath been, it shall ever be, Most passionless, pure eyes! Which never shall grow soft, nor change, nor pity me. A REQUIEM For John Gray Neobule, being tired, Far too tired to laugh or weep, From the hours, rosy and gray, Hid her golden face away. Neobule, fain of sleep, Slept at last as she desired! Neobule! is it well, That you haunt the hollow lands, Where the poor, dead people stray, Ghostly, pitiful and gray, Plucking, with their spectral hands, Scentless blooms of asphodel? Neobule, tired to death Of the flowers that I threw On her flower-like, fair feet, Sighed for blossoms not so sweet, Lunar roses pale and blue, Lilies of the world beneath. Neobule! ah, too tired Of the dreams and days above! Where the poor, dead people stray, Ghostly, pitiful and gray, Out of life and out of love, Sleeps the sleep which she desired. BEATA SOLITUDO For Sam. Smith What land of Silence, Where pale stars shine On apple-blossom And dew-drenched vine, Is yours and mine? The silent valley That we will find, Where all the voices Of humankind Are left behind. There all forgetting, Forgotten quite, We will repose us, With our delight Hid out of sight. The world forsaken, And out of mind Honour and labour, We shall not find The stars unkind. And men shall travail, And laugh and weep; But we have vistas Of gods asleep, With dreams as deep. A land of Silence, Where pale stars shine On apple-blossoms And dew-drenched vine, Be yours and mine! TERRE PROMISE For Herbert P. Horne Even now the fragrant darkness of her hair Had brushed my cheek; and once, in passing by, Her hand upon my hand lay tranquilly: What things unspoken trembled in the air! Always I know, how little severs me From mine heart's country, that is yet so far; And must I lean and long across a bar, That half a word would shatter utterly? Ah might it be, that just by touch of hand, Or speaking silence, shall the barrier fall; And she shall pass, with no vain words at all, But droop into mine arms, and understand! AUTUMNAL For Alexander Teixeira de Mattos Pale amber sunlight falls across The reddening October trees, That hardly sway before a breeze As soft as summer: summer's loss Seems little, dear! on days like these! Let misty autumn be our part! The twilight of the year is sweet: Where shadow and the darkness meet Our love, a twilight of the heart Eludes a little time's deceit. Are we not better and at home In dreamful Autumn, we who deem No harvest joy is worth a dream? A little while and night shall come, A little while, then, let us dream. Beyond the pearl'd horizons lie Winter and night: awaiting these We garner this poor hour of ease, Until love turn from us and die Beneath the drear November trees. IN TEMPORE SENECTUTIS When I am old, And sadly steal apart, Into the dark and cold, Friend of my heart! Remember, if you can, Not him who lingers, but that other man, Who loved and sang, and had a beating heart,— When I am old! When I am old, And all Love's ancient fire Be tremulous and cold: My soul's desire! Remember, if you may, Nothing of you and me but yesterday, When heart on heart we bid the years conspire To make us old. When I am old, And every star above Be pitiless and cold: My life's one love! Forbid me not to go: Remember nought of us but long ago, And not at last, how love and pity strove When I grew old! VILLANELLE OF HIS LADY'S TREASURES I took her dainty eyes, as well As silken tendrils of her hair: And so I made a Villanelle! I took her voice, a silver bell, As clear as song, as soft as prayer; I took her dainty eyes as well. It may be, said I, who can tell, These things shall be my less despair? And so I made a Villanelle! I took her whiteness virginal And from her cheek two roses rare: I took her dainty eyes as well. I said: ‘It may be possible Her image from my heart to tear!’ And so I made a Villanelle. I stole her laugh, most musical: I wrought it in with artful care; I took her dainty eyes as well; And so I made a Villanelle. GRAY NIGHTS For Charles Sayle Awhile we wandered (thus it is I dream!) Through a long, sandy track of No Man's Land, Where only poppies grew among the sand, The which we, plucking, cast with scant esteem, And ever sadlier, into the sad stream, Which followed us, as we went, hand in hand, Under the estrangèd stars, a road unplanned, Seeing all things in the shadow of a dream. And ever sadlier, as the stars expired, We found the poppies rarer, till thine eyes Grown all my light, to light me were too tired, And at their darkening, that no surmise Might haunt me of the lost days we desired, After them all I flung those memories! VESPERAL For Hubert Crackanthorpe Strange grows the river on the sunless evenings! The river comforts me, grown spectral, vague and dumb: Long was the day; at last the consoling shadows come: Sufficient fo the day are the day's evil things! Labour and longing and despair the long day brings; Patient till evening men watch the sun go west; Deferred, expected night at last brings sleep and rest: Sufficient for the day are the day's evil things! At last the tranquil Angelus of evening rings Night's curtain down for comfort and oblivion Of all the vanities observèd by the sun: Sufficient for the day are the day's evil things! So, some time, when the last of all our evenings Crowneth memorially the last of all our days, Not loth to take his poppies man goes down and says, ‘Sufficient for the day were the day's evil things!’ THE GARDEN OF SHADOW Love heeds no more the sighing of the wind Against the perfect flowers: thy garden's close Is grown a wilderness, where none shall find One strayed, last petal of one last year's rose. O bright, bright hair! O mouth like a ripe fruit! Can famine be so nigh to harvesting? Love, that was songful, with a broken lute In grass of graveyards goeth murmuring. Let the wind blow against the perfect flowers, And all thy garden change and glow with spring: Love is grown blind with no more count of hours, Nor part in seed-time nor in harvesting. SOLI CANTARE PERITI ARCADES For Aubrey Beardsley Oh, I would live in a dairy, And its Colin I would be, And many a rustic fairy Should churn the milk with me. Or the fields should be my pleasure, And my flocks should follow me, Piping a frolic measure For Joan or Marjorie. For the town is black and weary, And I hate the London street; But the country ways are cheery, And country lanes are sweet. Good luck to you, Paris ladies! Ye are over fine and nice, I know where the country maid is, Who needs not asking twice. Ye are brave in your silks and satins, As ye mince about the Town; But her feet go free in pattens, If she wear a russet gown. If she be not queen nor goddess She shall milk my brown-eyed herds, And the breasts beneath her boddice Are whiter than her curds. So I will live in a dairy, And its Colin I will be, And it's Joan that I will marry, Or, haply, Marjorie. ON THE BIRTH OF A FRIEND'S CHILD For Victor and Nellie Plarr Mark the day white, on which the Fates have smiled: Eugenio and Egeria have a child. On whom abundant grace kind Jove imparts If she but copy either parent's parts. Then, Muses! long devoted to her race, Grant her Egeria's virtues and her face; Nor stop your bounty there, but add to it Eugenio's learning and Eugenio's wit. EXTREME UNCTION For Lionel Johnson Upon the eyes, the lips, the feet, On all the passages of sense, The atoning oil is spread with sweet Renewal of lost innocence. The feet, that lately ran so fast To meet desire, are soothly sealed; The eyes, that were so often cast On vanity, are touched and healed. From troublous sights and sounds set free; In such a twilight hour of breath, Shall one retrace his life, or see, Through shadows, the true face of death? Vials of mercy! Sacring oils! I know not where nor when I come, Nor through what wanderings and toils, To crave of you Viaticum. Yet, when the walls of flesh grow weak, In such an hour, it well may be, Through mist and darkness, light will break, And each anointed sense will see. AMANTIUM IRAE When this, our rose, is faded, And these, our days, are done, In lands profoundly shaded From tempest and from sun: Ah, once more come together, Shall we forgive the past, And safe from worldly weather Possess our souls at last? Or in our place of shadows Shall still we stretch an hand To green, remembered meadows, Of that old pleasant land? And vainly there foregathered, Shall we regret the sun? The rose of love, ungathered? The bay, we have not won? Ah, child! the world's dark marges May lead to Nevermore, The stately funeral barges Sail for an unknown shore, And love we vow to-morrow, And pride we serve to-day: What if they both should borrow Sad hues of yesterday? Our pride! Ah, should we miss it, Or will it serve at last? Our anger, if we kiss it, Is like a sorrow past. While roses deck the garden, While yet the sun is high, Doff sorry pride for pardon, Or ever love go by. IMPENITENTIA ULTIMA For Robert Harborough Sherard Before my light goes out for ever if God should give me a choice of graces, I would not reck of length of days, nor crave for things to be; But cry:‘One day of the great lost days, one face of all the faces, Grant me to see and touch once more and nothing more to see. For, Lord, I was free of all Thy flowers, but I chose the world's sad roses, And that is why my feet are torn and mine eyes are blind with sweat, But at Thy terrible judgement-seat, when this my tired life closes, I am ready to reap whereof I sowed, and pay my righteous debt. But once before the sand is run and the silver thread is broken, Give me a grace and cast aside the veil of dolorous years, Grant me one hour of all mine hours, and let me see for a token Her pure and pitiful eyes shine out, and bathe her feet with tears.’ Her pitiful hands should calm, and her hair stream down and blind me, Out of the sight of night, and out of the reach of fear, And her eyes should be my light whilst the sun went out behind me, And the viols in her voice be the last sound in mine ear. Before the ruining waters fall and my life be carried under, And Thine anger cleave me through as a child cuts down a flower, I will praise Thee, Lord, in Hell, while my limbs are racked asunder, For the last sad sight of her face and the little grace of an hour. A VALEDICTION If we must part, Then let it be like this; Not heart on heart, Nor with the useless anguish of a kiss; But touch mine hand and say: ‘Until to-morrow or some other day, If we must part.’ Words are so weak When love hath been so strong: Let silence speak: ‘Life is a little while, and love is long; A time to sow and reap, And after harvest a long time to sleep, But words are weak.’ SAPIENTIA LUNAE For André Lebey The wisdom of the world said unto me: ‘Go forth and run, the race is to the brave; Perchance some honour tarrieth for thee!’ ‘As tarrieth,’ I said, ‘for sure, the grave.’ For I had pondered on a rune of roses, Which to her votaries the moon discloses. The wisdom of the world said: ‘There are bays: Go forth and run, for victory is good, After the stress of the laborious days.’ ‘Yet,’ said I, ‘shall I be the worms’ sweet food, As I went musing on a rune of roses, Which in her hour, the pale, soft moon discloses. Then said my voices: ‘Wherefore strive or run, On dusty highways ever, a vain race? The long night cometh, starless, void of sun, What light shall serve thee like her golden face?’ For I had pondered on a rune of roses, And knew some secrets which the moon discloses. ‘Yea,’ said I, ‘for her eyes are pure and sweet As lilies, and the fragrance of her hair Is many laurels; and it is not meet To run for shadows when the prize is here;’ And I went reading in that rune of roses Which to her votaries the moon discloses. [Cease smiling, Dear! a little while be sad] Dum nos fata sinunt, oculos satiemus Amore. Propertius Cease smiling, Dear! a little while be sad, Here in the silence, under the wan moon; Sweet are thine eyes, but how can I be glad, Knowing they change so soon? For Love's sake, Dear, be silent! Cover me In the deep darkness of thy falling hair: Fear is upon me and the memory Of what is all men's share. O could this moment be perpetuate! Must we grow old, and leaden-eyed and gray, And taste no more the wild and passionate Love sorrows of to-day? Grown old, and faded, Sweet! and past desire, Let memory die, lest there be too much ruth, Remembering the old, extinguished fire Of our divine, lost youth. O red pomegranate of thy perfect mouth! My lips' life-fruitage, might I taste and die, Here in thy garden, where the scented south Wind chastens agony; Reap death from thy live lips in one long kiss, And look my last into thine eyes and rest: What sweets had life to me sweeter than this Swift dying on thy breast? Or, if that may not be, for Love's sake, Dear! Keep silence still, and dream that we shall lie, Red mouth to mouth, entwined, and always hear The south wind's melody, Here in thy garden, through the sighing boughs, Beyond the reach of time and chance and change, And bitter life and death, and broken vows, That sadden and estrange. SERAPHITA Come not before me now, O visionary face! Me tempest-tost, and borne along life's passionate sea; Troublous and dark and stormy though my passage be; Not here and now may we commingle or embrace, Lest the loud anguish of the waters should efface The bright illumination of thy memory, Which dominates the night: rest, far away from me, In the serenity of thine abiding-place! But when the storm is highest, and the thunders blare, And sea and sky are riven, O moon of all my night! Stoop down but once in pity of my great despair, And let thine hand, though over late to help, alight But once upon my pale eyes and my drowning hair, Before the great waves conquer in the last vain fight. EPIGRAM Because I am idolatrous and have besought, With grievous supplication and consuming prayer, The admirable image that my dreams have wrought Out of her swan's neck and her dark, abundant hair: The jealous gods, who brook no worship save their own, Turned my live idol marble and her heart to stone. QUID NON SPEREMUS, AMANTES? For Arthur Moore Why is there in the least touch of her hands More grace than other women's lips bestow, If love is but a slave in fleshly bands Of flesh to flesh, wherever love may go? Why choose vain grief and heavy-hearted hours For her lost voice, and dear remembered hair, If love may cull his honey from all flowers, And girls grow thick as violets, everywhere? Nay! She is gone, and all things fall apart; Or she is cold, and vainly have we prayed; And broken is the summer's splendid heart, And hope within a deep, dark grave is laid. As man aspires and falls, yet a soul springs Out of his agony of flesh at last, So love that flesh enthralls, shall rise on wings Soul-centred, when the rule of flesh is past. Then, most High Love, or wreathed with myrtle sprays, Or crownless and forlorn, nor less a star, Thee may I serve and follow, all my days, Whose thorns are sweet as never roses are! CHANSON SANS PAROLES In the deep violet air, Not a leaf is stirred; There is no sound heard, But afar, the rare Trilled voice of a bird. Is the wood's dim heart, And the fragrant pine, Incense, and a shrine Of her coming? Apart, I wait for a sign. What the sudden hush said, She will hear, and forsake, Swift, for my sake, Her green, grassy bed: She will hear and awake! She will hearken and glide, From her place of deep rest, Dove-eyed, with the breast Of a dove, to my side: The pines bow their crest. I wait for a sign: The leaves to be waved, The tall tree-tops laved In a flood of sunshine, This world to be saved! In the deep violet air, Not a leaf is stirred; There is no sound heard, But afar, the rare Trilled voice of a bird. DECORATIONS: IN VERSE AND PROSE BEYOND Love's aftermath! I think the time is now That we must gather in, alone, apart The saddest crop of all the crops that grow, Love's aftermath. Ah, sweet,—sweet yesterday, the tears that start Can not put back the dial; this is, I trow, Our harvesting! Thy kisses chill my heart, Our lips are cold; averted eyes avow The twilight of poor love: we can but part, Dumbly and sadly, reaping as we sow, Love's aftermath. IN VERSE DE AMORE Shall one be sorrowful because of love, Which hath no earthly crown, Which lives and dies, unknown? Because no words of his shall ever move Her maiden heart to own Him lord and destined master of her own: Is Love so weak a thing as this, Who can not lie awake, Solely for his own sake, For lack of the dear hands to hold, the lips to kiss, A mere heart-ache? Nay, though love's victories be great and sweet, Nor vain and foolish toys, His crowned, earthly joys, Is there no comfort then in love's defeat? Because he shall defer, For some short span of years all part in her, Submitting to forego The certain peace which happier lovers know; Because he shall be utterly disowned, Nor length of service bring Her least awakening: Foiled, frustrate and alone, misunderstood, discrowned, Is Love less King? Grows not the world to him a fairer place, How far soever his days Pass from his lady's ways, From mere encounter with her golden face? Though all his sighing be vain, Shall he be heavy-hearted and complain? Is she not still a star, Deeply to be desired, worshipped afar, A beacon-light to aid From bitter-sweet delights, Love's masquerade? Though he lose many things, Though much he miss: The heart upon his heart, the hand that clings, The memorable first kiss; Love that is love at all, Needs not an earthly coronal; Love is himself his own exceeding great reward, A mighty lord! Lord over life and all the ways of breath, Mighty and strong to save From the devouring grave; Yea, whose dominion doth out-tyrant death, Thou who art life and death in one, The night, the sun; Who art, when all things seem: Foiled, frustrate and forlorn, rejected of to-day, Go with me all my way, And let me not blaspheme. THE DEAD CHILD Sleep on, dear, now The last sleep and the best, And on thy brow, And on thy quiet breast, Violets I throw. Thy scanty years Were mine a little while; Life had no fears To trouble thy brief smile With toil or tears. Lie still, and be For evermore a child! Not grudgingly, Whom life has not defiled, I render thee. Slumber so deep, No man would rashly wake; I hardly weep, Fain only, for thy sake, To share thy sleep. Yes, to be dead, Dead, here with thee to-day,— When all is said 'Twere good by thee to lay My weary head. The very best! Ah, child so tired of play, I stand confessed: I want to come thy way, And share thy rest. CARTHUSIANS Through what long heaviness, assayed in what strange fire, Have these white monks been brought into the way of peace, Despising the world's wisdom and the world's desire, Which from the body of this death bring no release? Within their austere walls no voices penetrate; A sacred silence only, as of death, obtains; Nothing finds entry here of loud or passionate; This quiet is the exceeding profit of their pains. From many lands they came, in divers fiery ways; Each knew at last the vanity of earthly joys; And one was crowned with thorns, and one was crowned with bays, And each was tired at last of the world's foolish noise. It was not theirs with Dominic to preach God's holy wrath, They were too stern to bear sweet Francis' gentle sway; Theirs was a higher calling and a steeper path, To dwell alone with Christ, to meditate and pray. A cloistered company, they are companionless, None knoweth here the secret of his brother's heart: They are but come together for more loneliness, Whose bond is solitude and silence all their part. O beatific life! Who is there shall gainsay, Your great refusal's victory, your little loss, Deserting vanity for the more perfect way, The sweeter service of the most dolorous Cross. Ye shall prevail at last! Surely ye shall prevail! Your silence and austerity shall win at last: Desire and mirth, the world's ephemeral lights shall fail, The sweet star of your queen is never overcast. We fling up flowers and laugh, we laugh across the wine; With wine we dull our souls and careful strains of art; Our cups are polished skulls round which the roses twine: None dares to look at Death who leers and lurks apart. Move on, white company, whom that has not sufficed! Our viols cease, our wine is death, our roses fail: Pray for our heedlessness, O dwellers with the Christ! Though the world fall apart, surely ye shall prevail. THE THREE WITCHES All the moon-shed nights are over, And the days of gray and dun; There is neither may nor clover, And the day and night are one. Not an hamlet, not a city Meets our strained and tearless eyes; In the plain without a pity, Where the wan grass droops and dies. We shall wander through the meaning Of a day and see no light, For our lichened arms are leaning On the ends of endless night. We, the children of Astarte, Dear abortions of the moon, In a gay and silent party, We are riding to you soon. Burning ramparts, ever burning! To the flame which never dies We are yearning, yearning, yearning, With our gay and tearless eyes. In the plain without a pity, (Not an hamlet, not a city) Where the wan grass droops and dies. VILLANELLE OF THE POET'S ROAD Wine and woman and song, Three things garnish our way: Yet is day over long. Lest we do our youth wrong, Gather them while we may: Wine and woman and song. Three things render us strong, Vine leaves, kisses and bay; Yet is day over long. Unto us they belong, Us the bitter and gay, Wine and woman and song. We, as we pass along, Are sad that they will not stay; Yet is day over long. Fruits and flowers among, What is better than they: Wine and woman and song? Yet is day over long. VILLANELLE OF ACHERON By the pale marge of Acheron, Methinks we shall pass restfully, Beyond the scope of any sun. There all men hie them one by one, Far from the stress of earth and sea, By the pale marge of Acheron. 'Tis well when life and love is done, 'Tis very well at last to be, Beyond the scope of any sun. No busy voices there shall stun Our ears: the stream flows silently By the pale marge of Acheron. There is the crown of labour won, The sleep of immortality, Beyond the scope of any sun. Life, of thy gifts I will have none, My queen is that Persephone, By the pale marge of Acheron, Beyond the scope of any sun. SAINT GERMAIN-EN-LAYE (1887-1895) Through the green boughs I hardly saw thy face, They twined so close: the sun was in mine eyes; And now the sullen trees in sombre lace Stand bare beneath the sinister, sad skies. O sun and summer! Say in what far night, The gold and green, the glory of thine head, Of bough and branch have fallen? Oh, the white Gaunt ghosts that flutter where thy feet have sped, Across the terrace that is desolate, And rang then with thy laughter, ghost of thee, That holds its shroud up with most delicate, Dead fingers, and behind the ghost of me, Tripping fantastic with a mouth that jeers At roseal flowers of youth the turbid streams Toss in derision down the barren years To death the host of all our golden dreams. AFTER PAUL VERLAINE I Il pleut doucement sur la ville. Rimbaud Tears fall within mine heart, As rain upon the town: Whence does this languor start, Possessing all mine heart? O sweet fall of the rain Upon the earth and roofs! Unto an heart in pain, O music of the rain! Tears that have no reason Fall in my sorry heart: What! there was no treason? This grief hath no reason. Nay! the more desolate, Because, I know not why, (Neither for love nor hate) Mine heart is desolate. II Colloque Sentimental Into the lonely park all frozen fast, Awhile ago there were two forms who passed. Lo, are their lips fallen and their eyes dead, Hardly shall a man hear the words they said. Into the lonely park, all frozen fast, There came two shadows who recall the past. ‘Dost thou remember our old ecstasy?’— ‘Wherefore should I possess that memory?’— ‘Doth thine heart beat at my sole name alway? Still dost thou see my soul in visions?’ ‘Nay!’— ‘They were fair days of joy unspeakable, Whereon our lips were joined?’—‘I cannot tell.’— ‘Were not the heavens blue, was not hope high?’— ‘Hope has fled vanquished down the darkling sky.’— So through the barren oats they wanderèd, And the night only heard the words they said. III Spleen Around were all the roses red, The ivy all around was black. Dear, so thou only move thine head, Shall all mine old despairs awake! Too blue, too tender was the sky, The air too soft, too green the sea. Always I fear, I know not why, Some lamentable flight from thee. I am so tired of holly-sprays And weary of the bright box-tree, Of all the endless country ways; Of everything alas! save thee. IV The sky is up above the roof So blue, so soft! A tree there, up above the roof, Swayeth aloft. A bell within that sky we see, Chimes low and faint: A bird upon that tree we see, Maketh complaint. Dear God! is not the life up there, Simple and sweet? How peacefully are borne up there Sounds of the street! What hast thou done, who comest here, To weep alway? Where hast thou laid, who comest here, Thy youth away? TO HIS MISTRESS There comes an end to summer, To spring showers and hoar rime; His mumming to each mummer Has somewhere end in time, And since life ends and laughter, And leaves fall and tears dry, Who shall call love immortal, When all that is must die? Nay, sweet, let's leave unspoken The vows the fates gainsay, For all vows made are broken, We love but while we may. Let's kiss when kissing pleases, And part when kisses pall, Perchance, this time to-morrow, We shall not love at all. You ask my love completest, As strong next year as now, The devil take you, sweetest, Ere I make aught such vow. Life is a masque that changes, A fig for constancy! No love at all were better, Than love which is not free. JADIS Erewhile, before the world was old, When violets grew and celandine, In Cupid's train we were enrolled: Erewhile! Your little hands were clasped in mine, Your head all ruddy and sun-gold Lay on my breast which was your shrine, And all the tale of love was told: Ah, God, that sweet things should decline, And fires fade out which were not cold, Erewhile. IN A BRETON CEMETERY They sleep well here, These fisher-folk who passed their anxious days In fierce Atlantic ways; And found not there, Beneath the long curled wave, So quiet a grave. And they sleep well These peasant-folk, who told their lives away, From day to market-day, As one should tell, With patient industry, Some sad old rosary. And now night falls, Me, tempest-tost, and driven from pillar to post, A poor worn ghost, This quiet pasture calls; And dear dead people with pale hands Beckon me to their lands. TO WILLIAM THEODORE PETERS ON HIS RENAISSANCE CLOAK The cherry-coloured velvet of your cloak Time hath not soiled: its fair embroideries Gleam as when centuries ago they spoke To what bright gallant of Her Daintiness, Whose slender fingers, long since dust and dead, For love or courtesy embroidered The cherry-coloured velvet of this cloak. Ah! cunning flowers of silk and silver thread, That mock mortality! the broidering dame, The page they decked, the kings and courts are dead: Gone the age beautiful; Lorenzo's name, The Borgia's pride are but an empty sound; But lustrous still upon their velvet ground, Time spares these flowers of silk and silver thread. Gone is that age of pageant and of pride: Yet don your cloak, and haply it shall seem, The curtain of old time is set aside; As through the sadder coloured throng you gleam; We see once more fair dame and gallant gay, The glamour and the grace of yesterday: The elder, brighter age of pomp and pride. THE SEA-CHANGE Where river and ocean meet in a great tempestuous frown, Beyond the bar, where on the dunes the white-capped rollers break; Above, one windmill stands forlorn on the arid, grassy down: I will set my sail on a stormy day and cross the bar and seek That I have sought and never found, the exquisite one crown, Which crowns one day with all its calm the passionate and the weak. When the mad winds ar unreined, wilt thou not storm, my sea? (I have ever loved thee so, I have ever done thee wrong In drear terrestrial ways.) When I trust myself to thee With a last great hope, arise and sing thine ultimate, great song Sung to so many better men, O sing at last to me, That which when once a man has heard, he heeds not over long. I will bend my sail when the great day comes; thy kisses on my face Shall seal all things that are old, outworn; and anger and regret Shall fade as the dreams and days shall fade, and in thy salt embrace, When thy fierce caresses blind mine eyes and my limbs grow stark and set, All that I know in all my mind shall no more have a place: The weary ways of men and one woman I shall forget. Point du Pouldu DREGS The fire is out, and spent the warmth thereof, (This is the end of every song man sings!) The golden wine is drunk, the dregs remain, Bitter as wormwood and as salt as pain; And health and hope have gone the way of love Into the drear oblivion of lost things. Ghosts go along with us until the end; This was a mistress, this, perhaps, a friend. With pale, indifferent eyes, we sit and wait For the dropt curtain and the closing gate: This is the end of all the songs man sings. A SONG All that a man may pray, Have I not prayed to thee? What were praise left to say, Has not been said by me, O, ma mie? Yet thine eyes and thine heart, Always were dumb to me: Only to be my part, Sorrow has come from thee, O, ma mie? Where shall I seek and hide My grief away with me? Lest my bitter tears should chide, Bring brief dismay to thee, O, ma mie? More than a man may pray, Have I not prayed to thee? What were praise left to say, Has not been said by me, O, ma mie? BRETON AFTERNOON Here, where the breath of the scented-gorse floats through the sun-stained air, On a steep hill-side, on a grassy ledge, I have lain hours long and heard Only the faint breeze pass in a whisper like a prayer, And the river ripple by and the distant call of a bird. On the lone hill-side, in the gold sunshine, I will hush me and repose, And the world fades into a dream and a spell is cast on me; And what was all the strife about, for the myrtle or the rose, And why have I wept for a white girl's paleness passing ivory! Out of the tumult of angry tongues, in a land alone, apart, In a perfumed dream-land set betwixt the bounds of life and death, Here will I lie while the clouds fly by and delve an hole where my heart May sleep deep down with the gorse above and red, red earth beneath. Sleep and be quiet for an afternoon, till the rose-white angelus Softly steals my way from the village under the hill: Mother of God, O Misericord, look down in pity on us, The weak and blind who stand in our light and wreak ourselves such ill. VENITE DESCENDAMUS Let be at last; give over words and sighing, Vainly were all things said: Better at last to find a place for lying, Only dead. Silence were best, with songs and sighing over; Now be the music mute; Now let the dead, red leaves of autumn cover A vain lute. Silence is best: for ever and for ever, We will go down and sleep, Somewhere beyond her ken, where she need never Come to weep. Let be at last: colder she grows and colder; Sleep and the night were best; Lying at last where we can not behold her, We may rest. TRANSITION A little while to walk with thee, dear child; To lean on thee my weak and weary head; Then evening comes: the winter sky is wild, The leafless trees are black, the leaves long dead. A little while to hold thee and to stand, By harvest-fields of bending golden corn: Then the predestined silence, and thine hand, Lost in the night, long and weary and forlorn. A little while to love thee, scarcely time To love thee well enough; then time to part, To fare through wintry fields alone and climb The frozen hills, not knowing where thou art. Short summer-time and then, my heart's desire, The winter and the darkness: one by one The roses fall, the pale roses expire Beneath the slow decadence of the sun. EXCHANGES All that I had I brought, Little enough I know; A poor rhyme roughly wrought, A rose to match thy snow: All that I had I brought. Little enough I sought: But a word compassionate, A passing glance, or thought, For me outside the gate: Little enough I sought. Little enough I found: All that you had, perchance! With the dead leaves on the ground, I dance the devil's dance. All that you had I found. TO A LADY ASKING FOOLISH QUESTIONS Why am I sorry, Chloe? Because the moon is far: And who am I to be straigtened in a little earthly star? Because thy face is fair? And what if it had not been, The fairest face of all is the face I have not seen. Because the land is cold, and however I scheme and plot, I can not find a ferry to the land where I am not. Because thy lips are red and thy breasts upbraid the snow? (There is neither white nor red in the pleasance where I go.) Because thy lips grow pale and thy breasts grow dun and fall? I go where the wind blows, Chloe, and am not sorry at all. RONDEAU Ah, Manon, say, why is it we Are one and all so fain of thee? Thy rich red beauty debonnaire In very truth is not more fair, Than the shy grace and purity That clothe the maiden maidenly; Her gray eyes shine more tenderly And not less bright than thine her hair, Ah, Manon, say! Expound, I pray, the mystery Why wine-stained lip and languid eye, And most unsaintly Maenad air, Should move us more than all the rare White roses of virginity? Ah, Manon, say! MORITURA A song of the setting sun! The sky in the west is red, And the day is all but done: While yonder up overhead, All too soon, There rises, so cold, the cynic moon. A song of a winter day! The wind of the north doth blow, From a sky that's chill and gray, On fields where no crops now grow, Fields long shorn Of bearded barley and golden corn. A song of an old, old man! His hairs are white and his gaze, Long bleared in his visage wan, With its weight of yesterdays, Joylessly He stands and mumbles and looks at me. A song of a faded flower! 'Twas plucked in the tender bud, And fair and fresh for an hour, In a lady's hair it stood. Now, ah, now, Faded it lies in the dust and low. LIBERA ME Goddess the laughter-loving, Aphrodite befriend! Long have I served thine altars, serve me now at the end, Let me have peace of thee, truce of thee, golden one, send. Heart of my heart have I offered thee, pain of my pain, Yielding my life for the love of thee into thy chain; Lady and goddess be merciful, loose me again. All things I had that were fairest, my dearest and best, Fed the fierce flames on thine altar: ah, surely, my breast Shrined thee alone among goddesses, spurning the rest. Blossom of youth thou hast plucked of me, flower of my days; Stinted I nought in thine honouring, walked in thy ways, Song of my soul pouring out to thee, all in thy praise. Fierce was the flame while it lasted, and strong was thy wine, Meet for immortals that die not, for throats such as thine, Too fierce for bodies of mortals, too potent for mine. Blossom and bloom hast thou taken, now render to me Ashes of life that remain to me, few though they be, Truce of the love of thee, Cyprian, let me go free. Goddess, the laughter-loving, Aphrodite, restore Life to the limbs of me, liberty, hold me no more Having the first-fruits and flower of me, cast me the core. TO A LOST LOVE I seek no more to bridge the gulf that lies Betwixt our separate ways; For vainly my heart prays, Hope droops her head and dies; I see the sad, tired answer in your eyes. I did not heed, and yet the stars were clear; Dreaming that love could mate Lives grown so separate;— But at the best, my dear, I see we should not have been very near. I knew the end before the end was nigh: The stars have grown so plain; Vainly I sigh, in vain For things that come to some, But unto you and me will never come. WISDOM Love wine and beauty and the spring, While wine is red and spring is here, And through the almond blossoms ring The dove-like voices of thy Dear. Love wine and spring and beauty while The wine hath flavour and spring masks Her treachery in so soft a smile That none may think of toil and tasks. But when spring goes on hurrying feet, Look not thy sorrow in the eyes, And bless thy freedom from thy sweet: This is the wisdom of the wise. IN SPRING See how the trees and the osiers lithe Are green bedecked and the woods are blithe, The meadows have donned their cape of flowers The air is soft with the sweet May showers, And the birds make melody: But the spring of the soul, the spring of the soul, Cometh no more for you or for me. The lazy hum of the busy bees Murmureth through the almond trees; The jonquil flaunteth a gay, blonde head, The primrose peeps from a mossy bed, And the violets scent the lane. But the flowers of the soul, the flowers of the soul, For you and for me bloom never again. A LAST WORD Let us go hence: the night is now at hand; The day is overworn, the birds all flown; And we have reaped the crops the gods have sown; Despair and death; deep darkness o'er the land, Broods like an owl; we cannot understand Laughter or tears, for we have only known Surpassing vanity: vain things alone Have driven our perverse and aimless band. Let us go hence, somewhither strange and cold, To Hollow Lands where just men and unjust Find end of labour, where's rest for the old, Freedom to all from love and fear and lust. Twine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold Our life-sick hearts and turn them into dust. HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED POEMS TO CYNARA Ah take these songs my love, long time forgiven, Songs thou shalt never see, Yet let them stand as a token that I am shriven, As thou by me? The wrong is old, perchance could I approach thee, Eye speak to eye, who knows?— It should fade as a mist—ah well, I cannot reproach thee— He reaps who sows. Thou lovedst me once and I am still thy lover Fain of thee as of old Fain of thy lips and thy locks that did ever hover Twixt brown and gold Ay woe is me A MOSAIC Dreams, dreams of a day gone by! (Blue skies and the sunny south) A fair small face and a rosebud mouth, (O Love, my Love and Italy!) As the moist fresh rain in a time of drouth, She came, my Love, as a child to me. Grey olives and sparkling sea Shine bright through the clear calm air— Of gleaming gold is her waving hair— (O Love, my Love and Italy!) When the world was young and the earth was fair, She came, my Love, as a child to me. Dreams, dreams of a day gone by! (Grey eyes and a sunny smile) Pure and a maiden and free from guile, (O Love, my Love and Italy!) In a dream she came and a little while Tarried and went as a child from me. White horses out on the sea, Mist on the hills and a drizzling rain, The wind wails loud like a soul in pain:— (O Love, my Love and Italy!) I called her long yet I call in vain, Who came and went as a child from me. REQUIEM Encircle her head with a clustering wreath Of lilies and roses and woodland flowers, That she loved to pluck from garden and heath When the Earth smelt fresh of sweet May showers, And no sombre shade of sorrow had laid A pitiless hand on her sunny hours. Bring cowslips and violets and redolent may, And daffodowndillies all yellow clad, With the pale primrose, but never a spray Of sorrowing yew or cypress sad To shadow the grace of her peaceful face, With aught that is gloomy or dull or grey. For her life was a garden and she the pale Queen lily that ruled all that fair emprise. So weave her of flowers a maiden veil, That Death may not see her dear grey eyes, And hold her for aye, in his hut of clay, Where no sun shines and the stars never rise. Then one last long kiss on her beautiful hair, And one last long look at her shapely head,— Soft—turn away and shed never a tear, For the purest soul that ever sped, From a world of dust to her rest we trust— Nay—what is life that ye weep for the dead? POTNIA THEA When the voice of the gods hath spoken, The uttered word remains, The Parcae's web unbroken, Its pristine strength retains. Tho' the Cronian Zeus be dethronèd And desolate his shrines, Anangkè still star-crownèd, Her fateful threads entwines. Tho the goddess, the Cytherean, No longer with the Loves Flits o'er the blue Aegean To hallowed Paphos' groves. And Athênê has ceased enfolding The city of her heart, Its denizens beholding The Delian barque depart, Still the iconoclastic ages Touch not the veilèd dame Whom husbandmen and sages Avouch by different name. The Olympian queen's forgotten, Hephaestus' fires are cold, The sons of Zeus begotten, The heroes rest untold. Not a sound on the steep Cithaeron, Where once the Maenad's choir, Adored the mighty Bromian, With dithyrambic fire. Still the throne of Anangkè resteth Above the reach of years; Her crape-crowned sceptre breasteth The ages without fears. And when dynasties have been changed Of earths and gods and men, The goddess unestrangèd Shall be found ruling then. RONDEAU Could you forget, put out of mind, The vows you made, O most unkind? The sweet love songs, the fair and frail Lip utterance without avail, The pleasure that you used to find, Or said you found when passion blind, I kissed the hand that you resigned, Not all unwilling, maiden pale. Tho' you forget! Where once our sunny paths entwined There bloweth now the wintry wind:— Ah dreamt we then time would assail, Our trust and troth or love could fail, In those old days that lie behind, That you forget? RONDEAU In Autumn when the leaf is sere, In that still season of the year, Shall we not meet once more we twain, Who parted in the Spring of pain? With eyes of passion long grown clear, When youth is gone and Winter near, May we not meet once more my dear, Touch hands, forgive and part again, In Autumn? Tho' bitter anger still doth blear, The glory of the days that were, In rare still hours are you not fain To cry a truce to dear disdain, In Autumn? SONNETS in memoriam. H.C. ob. Feb. 24, 1886 I have no heart to wish thee back again To this sick earth, poor friend, who may have found, Beneath the kind cold shelter of the ground That calm memorial light that with much pain, Thou lost in thy last years and sought in vain. Nay it is better thus! thy life is crowned Tho' but in death with peace—no jarring sound Shall ever break the sleep wherein thou'rt lain. Yet when I mournfully recall to mind The fragrant summer days I spent with thee In such calm unison and how thy kind Unruffled cheerfulness would oftimes free My mind from brooding thought I look behind And fall before the shrine of memory. NOVALIS It has grown evening around me while I was looking into the red of morning. NOVALIS. Ay—even so—fixt was that ardent gaze Upon the East—his eagle eyes broad scanned The vault of heaven and all the outlying land, Shadowed in rose and amber neath the rays Born of the rising sun,—a day of days Was dawning for him mystical and grand, His budding hopes the morning soft breeze fanned, The future lay enwrapped in golden haze. A moment—and the loveliness is gone! Faded the glamour of morning from his sight, Faded the quivering radiance that shone On sea and shore and clothed the hills in light. A sombre shade of evening settled down And in the gathering gloom he stood alone. OF A LITTLE GIRL (I) When life doth languish midst the bitter wrong That riots everywhere, when all hopes fail, And comfort is most weak and doubt most strong, And friends are false and woman's troth proves frail, And all thy soul for very life-sickness Doth long to end, there yet is one sweet thing, One fresh oasis in the wilderness Of this sad world whereunto thou shalt cling As to salvation—a child's tender love. Ah do not doubt it—all things die and wane, Save this alone; this only lasts above, The lingering rule of weariness and pain, This love alone is stingless and can calm Life's fitful fever with its healing balm. (II) Was it at even, with the casement thrown Wide to the summer air, I sat and thought, Of that ideal which I ever sought, But fruitlessly—and so was fain to moan— ‘Ah weariness of waiting thus alone, With vanity of living all distraught, To find upon the earth nor peace nor aught Lovely or pure, whence all things sweet have gone.’ And then one passed the dark'ning road along And lit it with her childhood, that I felt Passion and bitterness like snowflakes melt Before the sun, and into praise and song From the despair wherein it long had dwelt My life burst flower-like and my soul grew strong. (III) The music in a name, who can conceive, Who may define? Ah child thou dost not know How many a time when my life's lamp burns low And hope's light flickers—thou wouldst not believe How thy dear treasured name will oft relieve My sinking heart, how sweetly soft and low My lips will frame it loath to let it go, And kiss it quietly till I cease to grieve. It is mine amulet, wrought rich and rare With lovely fantasies, it is a charm That whispered gently guardeth me from harm, It is my ritual, my mystic prayer, And in the hush of night thro' lattice bars I see it written in the lonely stars. (IV) Even as a child whose eager fingers snatch An ocean shell and hold it to his ear, With wondering, awe-struck eyes is hushed to catch The murmurous music of its coilèd sphere; Whispers of wind and wave, soul-stirring songs Of storm-tossed ships and all the mystery That to the illimitable sea belongs, Stream to him from its tiny cavity. As such an one with reverent awe I hold Thy tender hand, and in those pure grey eyes, That sweet child face, those tumbled curls of gold, And in thy smiles and loving, soft replies I find the whole of love—hear full and low Its mystic ocean's tremulous ebb and flow. (V) When it is over—when the final fight Has been out-fought and the last moisty clod Rattles upon my coffin, when the sod Seals me for ever in that land of night Whence joy and pain have ta'en impartial flight, And the old lanes my feet so oft have trod Know me no more but all men toil and plod Over my head, my name forgotten quite. Wilt thou sometimes—not often—God forfend That thought of me should chase away thy smile Or dull thy gladness, yet once in a while Dream of a day departed and a friend Who placed above the world and Fortune's prize The love that centred in thy childish eyes. (VI) For the last time, perhaps for weary years Perhaps for ever, I have looked upon Thy fair fair face;—those grey eyes that have shone Such comfort on me when the foul fiend fear's Gaunt haggard laugh would mock me and hot tears For very loathing of my life rain down, That trusting smile the one thing sweet I've known I' the bitterness of life—all disappears. Farewell, dear saint, I leave thee and I lay No tax upon thy memory though God knows This sobbing sea that sadly ebbs and flows Shall not more surely each returning day Cling to the callous shore than I in thee Behold my drear life's dearest memory. (VII) So—it is finished and I cannot weep Nor rave nor utter moan, life is too strong For my weak will, it carries me along On its fierce current till I fain would creep Into some cavern still and fall asleep And sleeping die, or melt like a sad song Into the winds—I care not to hold long This dreary life where pain alone is deep. O child, my child, forgive me, I am vain, Unworthy of thy love, I will not task Even thy pity, who have ta'en a mask And shall not show my living face again, Until the end of all things joy and pain Has given me more than now I dare to ask. (VIII) EPILOGUE [Let us go hence: the night is now at hand; The day is overworn, the birds all flown; And we have reaped the crops the gods have sown; Despair and death; deep darkness o'er the land, Broods like an owl; we cannot understand Laughter or tears, for we have only known Surpassing vanity: vain things alone Have driven our perverse and aimless band. Let us go hence, somewhither strange and cold, To Hollow Lands where just men and unjust Find end of labour, where's rest for the old, Freedom to all from love and fear and lust. Twine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold Our life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.] LA JEUNESSE N'A QU'UN TEMPS Swiftly passes youth away Night is coming, fades the day, All things turn to sombre grey. Pass the cup and drink, friends, deep Roses upon roses heap, Soon it will be time to sleep. Man, poor man, is born to die, Love and all things fair will fly Fill the cup and drain it dry. Make ye merry, while ye may; Snatch the sweetness of the day, Pluck life's pleasures while they stay When our youth has taken flight, When the day is lost in night, There can be no more delight. Here's a glass to memory Here's to death and vanity, Here's a glass to you and me. SONG OF THE XIXTH CENTURY O send us light! More light, more light and fuller clearer day, We mortals moan and shudder at the night, And ever still the shadows grow more grey, The stars less bright. O give us faith— In God, Man, anything to rise and break The mists of doubt, we cry, but like a wraith It still eludes our grasp and no rays streak The dark of Death. O give us rest! We all unrestful sigh, we ask not joy Who stand with tearless eyes by life opprest,— Joy turns to pain and love and sorrow cloy, But Peace is best. A LULLABY Sleep soundly, my pretty child, Sleep, sleep on And all things fearful and all things wild Far, far from thy pillow begone, Dream of the morrow, Thou shalt not wake to weep Unknowing of sorrow, O sleep, my little one, dream and sleep. Sleep softly, my darling sleep! Soon, too soon Dawneth the day when thou canst weep, Weep, wail for the joy that is flown, Wearily yearning, For love that is passed away, For peace unreturning. SPLEEN In the dull dark days of our life We wander without a goal; And the plague of living and strife Eats worm-like into our soul To the tune of sighing and tears, A weary purposeless band, For the destined desolate years, We fare thro' the Hopeless land. On our lips are signs as of fire, Our eyes are wild with despair, We are burnt with a fierce desire For that we know not nor care. With loathing of life that is past, With horror of days to be, We shiver like leaves in the blast, Neath the breath of memory In the tearing fangs of remorse We are fain to fall in the mire, And wallowing seek for the source, Of the Lethe we desire. Yet still are we troubled and torn, By ennui, spleen and regret, Whatever the depths of our scorn, We cannot hope to forget. O man, poor pitiful worm, Foul nature's filthiest spawn, As the helmless ship in a storm So thou from the day thou art born AFTER MANY YEARS Sleep on dear now! With thy golden hair that flows On thy calm, thy icy brow And thy close shut eyes, I trow The sounds of my song cannot move thee now. As they moved thee little in life—God knows. Time was of old, I did lull thee on my knee, And thy locks of rippling gold Streamed on my arm that did enfold, And rocked thee to sleep who wast not so cold, As thou liest now in Death's mystery. How many years Have waned since that distant day, Seen dim thro' a mist of tears? How many cycles of years? Answer me, child, for I have my fears That it was not real but part of a play. Is it a dream To see thee so calm and cold, Who when I knew thee did seem Never more still than the stream? Or is it part real and partly a dream Or a dream or in part the days of old? Have I grown grey? Or can it be I am dead. And in spite of all they say, And all I myself have said, It is not all done with the very dead, When the light of this life is worn away? Nay it is true! And I cannot doubt dear heart, That this is really you. 'Tis too sad not to be true And I mind me now it was this I knew When the high gods had it that we should part. You pay no heed, And I will not linger long For I trow you have no need Still to be lulled by my song. Now you sleep so sound and will sleep so long You can do without me in very deed. PRAETERITA O childish forms and faces That live in memorie's shrine; O pleasant paths and places That small feet trod with mine, The old days that are dying Soft melodies are sighing Of something that is lying, Pale in the past behind The laughter that rejoices Responds not to our quest, The tender children's voices, Are long time hushed to rest, And all the stress of ages, And all the love of sages Can not return the pages That life has once down pressed. Before us dawns the vista Of all our days to be, But shall we find, my sister, The charm that used to be We know now to our sorrow, The sad and strange to morrow, Can never never borrow The old time mystery. When you and I did wander On straying childish feet, Before us lying yonder The hills so strange and sweet; When life was in the dawning, The fair and golden morning Sent unto us no warning To stay the years' deceit. The golden light has faded That met our dazzled eyes, The purple hills are shaded, And leaden clouds arise; And spring of childhood's gladness And youth's brief summer madness Has yielded to the sadness Of dull autumnal skies. ADIOS! My sweet child-love, farewell! My little tender flower Who comforted me long and well, In many a hope-deserted hour, I bid thee now farewell. The years shall come and go And thro' thy village home, The rippling streamlet still shall flow, While far away my footsteps roam, Who bid thee now farewell. O sweet, O saintly face, And innocent grey eyes, That shone with such pathetic grace, Wherein such dreamy wisdom lies, I bid you now farewell. Flow on, dear life in peace, In peace and purity, And all my life I shall not cease, To hold thee shrined in memory, Who bid thee now farewell. SERAPHITA—SERAPHITUS I seek for thee, I call thee, O my darling In the land of wild unrest, Very fain I were to see thee and to hold thee And be pillowed on thy breast. All my early hopes and faiths have long time failed me, And this life of ours doth seem In the deathless sleep that hems the world on both sides But an evil passing dream Yet I long for thee, thou one form pure and perfect, In the seething obscene throng, Just to hold thee for one instant and to know thee, Then to part and pass along. It would help me on the dreary path before me, On the road thro Life to Death, To have met thee once, belovèd, ere I hie me To my home the earth beneath. Somewhere tho' I know thee not, I know thou dwellest, Somewhere on the earth, my queen, Thou art sitting waiting for me fond and faithful, Tho' a whole world flow between. And I send these songs out to thee from the shadows, And I call to thee and cling, Who are shrinèd tho' perchance I never find thee, In whatever song I sing. IT IS FINISHED The pure grey eyes are closèd now, They shall not look on yours again; Upon that pale and perfect brow, There stays no sign of grief or pain. The little face is white and cold, The parted lips give forth no breath, The grape-like curls of sun-bleached gold, Are clammy with the dews of death. Speak to her and she will not hear, Caress her, but she will not move, No longer feels she hope or fear, No longer knows she hate or love. Ah dream no false or futile dreams, Nor lull thyself on fantasy, That death is other than it seems, Or leads to immortality. She will not speak to thee again, Tho' thy whole soul in tears be shed, For tears and prayers are all in vain, She is but dead, she is but dead! ERE I GO HENCE Ere I go hence and am no longer seen, Ere I go hence into the dark of death, And leave my body and my vital breath, While over me the grass grows dank and green, Let me behold thee, let me once again Press thy fair palm, my fairest without stain, Ere I go hence. Ere I go hence and leave this upper light, Ere I go hence into the deathless sleep That lies beyond the land, where cold and deep, The stream of Lethe flows thro' endless night, Let me once more, my sweet child love, behold Thy pure grey eyes, thy tresses of bright gold— Ere I go hence. Ere I go hence and cast away all pain, Ere I go hence and falter and forget The fever and the madness and regret That make all life, all love so passing vain— O my heart's darling, let me hear once more The music of thy step upon the floor, Ere I go hence. TRANSIT GLORIA A gleam thro' the darkness Of years and of days, A transient lifting Of misery's haze! A sound of soft music, A momentary lull, Of this foul gnawing ennui, Then all things grow dull. A rift in life's shadow, Brief even as vain, The madness of pleasure, The sadness of pain. A dream of hope crownèd In days of despair; A vision of beauty In Vanity Fair. Like sweet children's voices, To one usèd long, To harsh-laughing harlots' Lascivious song. Like snow-drops in winter, Like soft summer rain, Like sleep to the weary And harassed by pain. Like long cherished memories, Death-white with regret, Too sad to remember, Too sweet to forget. Dreams of what might have been, Ere terrors were rife, A pause in the passion, The fever of life. A verdant oasis, With all around sand, A gush of blue violets, The touch of a hand. A meeting, a parting, For aeons and years; A smile changing quickly To passionate tears. Ah gone is the phantom Of hope and delight, And faded the vision In infinite night. Life's wave bears me onward A rudderless bark; Somewhere in the future, Death looms in the dark. The current flows faster, Loud waileth the wind; All sweet things and faces Fade fainter behind. The end cometh surely, And each weary wave Brings nearer and nearer, The haven, the grave. And soon from her labour, Tired mem'ry will cease And infinite slumber Bring infinite peace. 'Twas but for a moment This rift thro' the days, This transient lifting Of misery's haze. SONNET TO NATURE MORITURI TE SALUTANT Thou unclean harpy, odorous of despair, I offer up no praises on the shrine Of thy wild beauty; thou art not divine, Nor reverent at all thy tranquil air; I know thee, evil one, and I am ware Of all thy vileness;—never song of mine Shall swell the shameful triumphs that are thine Thou shalt not cajole me of ev'n one prayer. O false, foul mother who to sate thy lust, Insatiate of misery doth consume The lives that thou hast fashioned out of dust, Who feedest on the children of thy womb, Thy beauty cannot conquer our distrust, Thy tenderness is crueller than a tomb. AWAKENING We have dreamt dreams but now they are long over, Dreams of a life the other side of death; Drop down the curtain on the play completed, The farce of life is finished with the breath. We have believed the beautiful, false stories, Fed on the faiths that after childhood fail, Now to our eyes the universe appeareth A vessel rudderless without a sail. Man, in a world but fair in semblance only Veiling in light its secret of disgust, Is he not far of all vile things the vilest, He, the foul spawn of Nature's filthy lust? Man with his hopes and pitiful illusions, Is he not pitiful, grotesque, forlorn? White with desire for that life cannot proffer, Must we not weep that ever we were born? Is there one happy? Can there be one happy? Nay, for the only good we can attain, Death our dull goal, the senseless sleep for ever Puts alike end to pleasure and to pain. There shall we rest, but shall not ever know it, Shall not have love nor knowledge, nor delight, Only shall feel the fevered life fall from us, Sleepers unwitting in an endless night. LULLABY Blow soft thou summer wind, Rough be not nor unkind, Whisper outside the room, Where in the peaceful gloom, My darling lies a-sleeping. Let thy soft lullabies Shut the dear innocent eyes Of my child who lies a-sleeping. Stream on ye pale moon-beams, Light up her childish dreams, Flow round her small white bed Halo her golden head— My darling lies a-sleeping. Let her repose be sound, Wrap her in peace around, My child who lies a-sleeping. Hush, hush, thou unkind life, Tumid and full of strife, Let her sleep tranquilly, Let her white childhood be, My sweet who lies a-sleeping. Save her soft eyes from tears And the bitter love of years,— My child who lies a-sleeping. THE OLD YEAR We stand at the end of the old year, On the threshold of the new, And we turn to the old year dying, And shrink from the strange and new; Ah, all fair children, welcome The strong, young year that is born, For us, who are no more children, Who have little to do with morn, We will sit, old year, in the firelight, And see the last of you. There you lie, with your sick, scarred visage, Who were once so fair to see, And the death-dew clings to your forehead, And your breath draws painfully:— In accents low you tell us, How there is one end to all, How love endures for a season, How mirth departs in the fall— As the day is, so the tomorrow, As it has been, it shall be. Where are they, the loves and passions Of the old, sad year that dies? They are dead, they are gone, forgotten More swift than the summer skies;— The tears, the song, the laughter,— Ah say, were they worth regret? Old year, is it kind or cruel, That we wander and forget The good and the ill we gather From every year that dies? Nay we wish thee well, we forgive thee, And ywis that this is true,— There are fairer days in the old years Than ever dawn in the new! What if we find fresh faces In the young new year that dawns, A guerdon of joy or sorrow, A crown of laurel or thorns,— There are sweeter things in the old years Than ever come with the new. THE NEW YEAR The bells ring out, the year is born, And shall we hope or shall we mourn? Shall we embrace the young, new year, Or shall we turn back lingering eyes, To the low bier, Where in his pall the old year lies? What shall he bring to men who weep, To men who laugh and men who sleep, So very weary of the sun? Shall one of these men ever gain, Ah even one, His heart's desire nor find it vain? Hope not, fear not: he only bears The message of the elder years! A little love, a little pain! To some a sweet or idle dream, To some again, The sleep wherein we do not dream. Ah sweet, my child, and yet mine own, Though I must wander on alone, Love me a little, clasp me still With thy soft hands, and I will bear For good or ill The burden of the coming year. FROM THE ICELANDIC Long time ago, I vowed to the Sea, My destined wife, My one desire, I will give thee my life To hold of me: For others the green, the daedal earth My joy, my sorrow, my tears, my mirth Be thine O Sea! They called me fickle, they called me cold, My human loves— Cried: ‘His fancy moves as the salt sea moves’, Who were not told, How thy bitter kisses held my heart, Sealed thine forever and set apart My bride, my Sea! O changeful one! I cried to the Sea, O changeless one! I forget me all things beneath the Sun, When rocked by thee. Thine anger woos me, thy tempests thrill, For am I not thine, to do thy will O Sea, my Sea? And now thou art risen to prove my vows, My wooing done, I was ever thy lover—, shall I shun To be thy spouse? Was it not this that I knew before, Waited and yearned for, when I swore To wed the Sea? So!—comfort me, cool me, shed thy breath, Spare no embrace; Ah lean thy brow over me, shroud my face, Kiss me to Death; I am one with thee, O most sweet, held fast, Made thine for ever, thy spouse at last, O Sea, my Sea! LOVE'S EPILOGUE When summer dies There's an end of singing; Dumb tears are springing To wistful eyes, At the death of summer When the swallow flies, His swift course winging To softer skies. Ev'n so, most sweet, Is song time departed, And we are parted, As was most meet, At the death of summer, At the year's defeat, To cry sad hearted, That love is fleet. Now all is said, It were ill to tarry, With tears to harry, Love that is dead. In the chill of autumn, When the leaves are shed, His corse we carry, To earth, his bed. Ah, look not there, To where Love reposes! Till tired life closes, Be fain! Beware! In the chill of autumn,— Ah, forget thee where With rue and roses, Thou hid'st Love's bier RONDEAU Hélène You loved me once! I charge you, sweet, Leave me this last, one faith—in spite Of broken vows and time's deceit, You loved me once! What tho' I sit in utter night And hear the swift, departing feet Of young desires that take their flight, And mourn that love should be so fleet, And weep that you should prove so light, The time has been I was complete,— You loved me once! ROUNDEL To Hélène The golden hours! Ah, prithee, art not fain Sometimes to drop a tear for their dead sake, Who were so fair, to yearn for them again, The golden hours? Could I forget them? Not though I should take Of Lethe and Nepenthe for my pain; I shall remember, sleeping and awake, While life is life, my love and thy disdain— Nay, though I die, methinks, I shall not slake The thirst wherewith my soul recalls in vain The golden hours! RONDEL Ah, dear child, in whose kiss Is healing of my pain, Since life has given me this, I will no more complain. My heart to life, ywis, Thy clinging hands enchain, Ah, dear child in whose kiss, Is healing of my pain. Love me—I shall not miss Old loves that did but stain, Thy blue eyes teach me bliss,— I am not all in vain, Ah, dear child, in whose kiss Is healing of my pain. Discedam, explebo numerum, reddarque tenebris, I decus, i, nostrum; melioribus utere fatis. Because my life is an unworthy thing Outworn and mildewed, I am dismayed, I dare not give it thee, O child! O maid! Too late divined, too sweet for me to sing: Surely, my barren days I may not bring, But rather giftless come, lest any shade Or prescience of autumn should be laid Upon thy fair life in its blossoming. Yet would I give thee all, who stand aside, Giving thee naught: yea! gladly lie down dead That haply coming, where the roads divide On lilies still thy tender feet might tread, In daisied ways of innocence abide, Until thy tale of days is reckoned. AGAINST MY LADY BURTON: ON HER BURNING THE LAST WRITING OF HER DEAD HUSBAND ‘To save his soul’, whom narrowly she loved She did this deed of everlasting shame, For devils' laughter; and was soulless proved Heaping dishonour on her scholar's name. Her lean distrust awoke when he was dead; Dead, hardly cold; whose life was worn away In scholarship's high service; from his head She lightly tore his ultimate crown of bay. His masterpiece, the ripe fruit of his age, In art's despite she gave the hungry flame; Smiled at the death of each laborious page, Which she read only by the light of shame. Dying he trusted her: him dead she paid Most womanly, destroying his life's prize: So Judas decently his Lord betrayed With deep dishonour wrought in love's disguise. With deep dishonour, for her jealous heart His whole life's work, with light excuse put by For love of him, or haply, hating art. Oh Love be this, let us curse Love and die. Nay! Love forgive: could such a craven thing Love anywhere? but let her name pass down Dishonoured through the ages, who did fling To the rank scented mob a sage's crown, And offered Fame, Love, Honour, mincingly To her one God—sterile Propriety! THE REQUITAL Because I am idolatrous, and have besought, With grievous supplication, and consuming prayer, The admirable image; that my dreams have wrought, Out of her swan's neck and her dark, abundant hair; The jealous gods that brook no worship save their own, Turn my live idol marble, and her heart—a stone! A LETTER FROM M.M. VERSIFIED OUT OF POOR PROSE INTO CATCHPENNY VERSE! Dear Sir! would you be popular, Then never mention Greek! Be arrogant and insular, Dear Sir, would you be popular: Cut classics; and for guiding star, Read Birrell once a week. Dear Sir! would you be popular, Then never mention Greek. Lionel Johnson. [In the days of the good, gay people] In the days of the good, gay people, Of the little folk in green, The Moon shone clear in Fairyland, Or ever the world was seen. [As his own Arthur fared across the mere] In vein we cross the seas change lands, In search of that we know not HITHERTO UNCOLLECTED POEMS THE PASSING OF TENNYSON As his own Arthur fared across the mere, With the grave Queen, past knowledge of the throng, Serene and calm, rebuking grief and tear, Departs this prince of song. Whom the gods love Death doth not cleave nor smite, But like an angel, with soft trailing wing, He gathers them upon the hush of night, With voice and beckoning. The moonlight falling on that august head Smoothed out the mark of time's defiling hand, And hushed the voice of mourning round his bed— ‘He goes to his own land’. Beyond the ramparts of the world where stray The laureled few o'er fields Elysian, He joins his elders of the lyre and bay, Led by the Mantuan. We mourn him not, but sigh with Bedivere, Not perished be the sword he bore so long, Excalibur, whom none is left to wear— His magic brand of song. FANTASIE TRISTE To my first love Loved all above; In late spring; Pansies, pansies Such strange fancies Was all I had to bring. To my last love Loved all above: At evening Of autumn One chrysanthemum Is all I have to bring. O first, be last In a dim past! With the dead flowers And the strayed hours There are no flowers left to bring There are no songs left to sing Let be at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II DRAMATIC AND EPIC POETRY THE PIERROT OF THE MINUTE A DRAMATIC PHANTASY IN ONE ACT THE CHARACTERS A Moon Maiden Pierrot THE SCENE A glade in the Parc du Petit Trianon. In the centre a Doric temple with steps coming down the stage. On the left a little Cupid on a pedestal. Twilight. (Pierrot enters with his hands full of lilies. He is burdened with a little basket. He stands gazing at the Temple and the Statue.) Pierrot. My journey's end! This surely is the glade Which I was promised: I have well obeyed! A clue of lilies was I bid to find, Where the green alleys most obscurely wind; Where tall oaks darkliest canopy o'erhead, And moss and violet make the softest bed; Where the path ends, and leagues behind me lie The gleaming courts and gardens of Versailles; The lilies streamed before me, green and white; I gathered, following: they led me right, To the bright temple and the sacred grove: This is, in truth, the very shrine of Love! (He gathers together his flowers and lays them at the foot of Cupid's statue; then he goes timidly up the first steps of the temple and stops.) Pierrot. It is so solitary, I grow afraid. Is there no priest here, no devoted maid? Is there no oracle, no voice to speak, Interpreting to me the word I seek? (A very gentle music of lutes floats out from the temple. Pierrot starts back; he shows extreme surprise; then he returns to the foreground, and crouches down in rapt attention until the music ceases. His face grows puzzled and petulant.) Pierrot. Too soon! too soon! in that enchanting strain, Days yet unlived, I almost lived again: It almost taught me that I most would know— Why am I here, and why am I Pierrot? (Absently he picks up a lily which has fallen to the ground, and repeats:) Pierrot. Why came I here, and why am I Pierrot? That music and this silence both affright; Pierrot can never be a friend of night. I never felt my solitude before— Once safe at home, I will return no more. Yet the commandment of the scroll was plain; While the light lingers let me read again. (He takes a scroll from his bosom and reads:) Pierrot. ‘He loves to-night who never loved before; Who ever loved, to-night shall love once more.’ I never loved! know not what love is. I am so ignorant—but what is this? (Reads) ‘Who would adventure to encounter Love Must rest one night within this hallowed grove. Cast down thy lilies, which have led thee on, Before the tender feet of Cupidon.’ Thus much is done, the night remains to me. Well, Cupidon, be my security! Here is more writing, but too faint to read. (He puzzles for a moment, then casts the scroll down.) Pierrot. Hence, vain old parchment. I have learnt thy rede! (He looks round uneasily, starts at his shadow; then discovers his basket with glee. He takes out a flask of wine, pours it into a glass, and drinks.) Pierrot. Courage, mon Ami! I shall never miss Society with such a friend as this. How merrily the rosy bubbles pass, Across the amber crystal of the glass. I had forgotten you. Methinks this quest Can wake no sweeter echo in my breast. (Looks round at the statue, and starts.) Pierrot. Nay, little god! forgive. I did but jest. (He fills another glass, and pours it upon the statue.) Pierrot. This libation, Cupid, take, With the lilies at thy feet; Cherish Pierrot for their sake Send him visions strange and sweet, While he slumbers at thy feet. Only love kiss him awake! Only love kiss him awake! (Slowly falls the darkness, soft music plays, while Pierrot gathers together fern and foliage into a rough couch at the foot of the steps which lead to the Temple d'Amour. Then he lies down upon it, having made his prayer. It is night.) Pierrot. (Softly.) Music, more music, far away and faint: It is an echo of mine heart's complaint. Why should I be so musical and sad? I wonder why I used to be so glad? In single glee I chased blue butterflies, Half butterfly myself, but not so wise, For they were twain, and I was only one. Ah me! how pitiful to be alone. My brown birds told me much, but in mine ear They never whispered this—I learned it here: The soft wood sounds, the rustlings in the breeze, Are but the stealthy kisses of the trees. Each flower and fern in this enchanted wood Leans to her fellow, and is understood; The eglantine, in loftier station set, Stoops down to woo the maidly violet. In gracile pairs the very lilies grow: None is companionless except Pierrot. Music, more music! how its echoes steal Upon my senses with unlooked for weal. Tired am I, tired, and far from this lone glade Seems mine old joy in rout and masquerade. Sleep cometh over me, now will I prove, By Cupid's grace, what is this thing called love. (Sleeps.) (There is more music of lutes for an interval, during which a bright radiance, white and cold, streams from the temple upon the face of Pierrot. Presently a Moon Maiden steps out of the temple; she descends and stands over the sleeper.) The Lady. Who is this mortal Who ventures to-night To woo an immortal, Cold, cold the moon's light, For sleep at this portal, Bold lover of night. Fair is the mortal In soft, silken white, Who seeks an immortal. Ah, lover of night, Be warned at the portal, And save thee in flight! (She stoops over him: Pierrot stirs in his sleep.) Pierrot (Murmuring). Forget not, Cupid. Teach me all thy lore: ‘He loves to-night who never loved before.’ The Lady. Unwitting boy! when, be it soon or late, What Pierrot ever has escaped his fate? What if I warned him! He might yet evade, Through the long windings of this verdant glade; Seek his companions in the blither way, Which, else, must be as lost as yesterday. So might he still pass some unheeding hours In the sweet company of birds and flowers. How fair he is, with red lips formed for joy, As softly curved as those of Venus' boy. Methinks his eyes, beneath their silver sheaves, Rest tranquilly like lilies under leaves. Arrayed in innocence, what touch of grace Reveals the scion of a courtly race? Well, I will warn him, though, I fear, too late— What Pierrot ever has escaped his fate? But, see, he stirs, new knowledge fires his brain, And Cupid's vision bids him wake again. Dione's Daughter! but how fair he is, Would it be wrong to rouse him with a kiss? (She stoops down and kisses him, then withdraws into the shadow.) Pierrot (Rubbing his eyes). Celestial messenger! remain, remain; Or, if a vision, visit me again! What is this light, and whither am I come To sleep beneath the stars so far from home? (Rises slowly to his feet.) Pierrot. Stay, I remember this is Venus' Grove, And I am hither come to encounter— The Lady (Coming forward, but veiled). Love! Pierrot (In ecstasy, throwing himself at her feet). Then have I ventured and encountered Love? The Lady. Not yet, rash boy! and, if thou wouldst be wise, Return unknowing; he is safe who flies. Pierrot. Never, sweet lady, will I leave this place Until I see the wonder of thy face. Goddess or Naiad! lady of this Grove, Made mortal for a night to teach me love, Unveil thyself, although thy beauty be Too luminous for my mortality. The Lady (Unveiling). Then, foolish boy, receive at length thy will: Now knowest thou the greatness of thine ill. Pierrot. Now have I lost my heart, and gained my goal. The Lady. Didst thou not read the warning on the scroll? Pierrot (Picking up the parchment). I read it all, as on this quest I fared, Save where it was illegible and hard. The Lady. Alack! poor scholar, wast thou never taught A little knowledge serveth less than naught? Hadst thou perused—but, stay, I will explain What was the writing which thou didst disdain. (Reads) ‘Au Petit Trianon, at night's full noon, Mortal, beware the kisses of the moon! Whoso seeks her she gathers like a flower— He gives a life, and only gains an hour.’ Pierrot (Laughing recklessly). Bear me away to thine enchanted bower, All of my life I venture for an hour. The Lady. Take up thy destiny of short delight; I am thy lady for a summer's night. Lift up your viols, maidens of my train, And work such havoc on this mortal's brain That for a moment he may touch and know Immortal things, and be full Pierrot. White music, Nymphs! Violet and Eglantine! To stir his tired veins like magic wine. What visitants across his spirit glance, Lying on lilies, while he watch me dance? Watch, and forget all weary things of earth, All memories and cares, all joy and mirth, While my dance wooes him, light and rythmical, And weaves his heart into my coronal. Music, more music for his soul's delight: Love is his lady for a summer's night. (Pierrot reclines, and gazes at her while she dances. The dance finished, she beckons to him: he rises dreamily, and stands at her side.) Pierrot. Whence came, dear Queen, such magic melody? The Lady. Pan made it long ago in Arcady. Pierrot. I heard it long ago, I know not where, As I knew thee, or ever I came here. But I forget all things—my name and race, All that I ever knew except thy face. Who art thou, lady? Breathe a name to me, That I may tell it like a rosary. Thou, whom I sought, dear Dryad of the trees, How art thou designate—art thou Heart's-Ease? The Lady. Waste not the night in idle questioning, Since Love departs at dawn's awakening. Pierrot. Nay, thou art right; what recks thy name or state, Since thou art lovely and compassionate. Play out thy will on me: I am thy lyre. The Lady. I am to each the face of his desire. Pierrot. I am not Pierrot, but Venus' dove, Who craves a refuge on the breast of love. The Lady. What wouldst thou of the maiden of the moon? Until the cock crow I may grant thy boon. Pierrot. Then, sweet Moon Maiden, in some magic car, Wrought wondrously of many a homeless star— Such must attend thy journeys through the skies,— Drawn by a team of milk-white butterflies, Whom, with soft voice and music of thy maids, Thou urgest gently through the heavenly glades; Mount me beside thee, bear me far away From the low regions of the solar day; Over the rainbow, up into the moon, Where is thy palace and thine opal throne; There on thy bosom— The Lady. Too ambitious boy! I did but promise thee one hour of joy. This tour thou plannest, with a heart so light, Could hardly be completed in a night. Hast thou no craving less remote than this? Pierrot. Would it be impudent to beg a kiss? The Lady. I say not that: yet prithee have a care! Often audacity has proved a snare. How wan and pale do moon-kissed roses grow— Dost thou not fear my kisses, Pierrot? Pierrot. As one who faints upon the Libyan plain Fears the oasis which brings life again! The Lady. Where far away green palm trees seem to stand May be a mirage of the wreathing sand. Pierrot. Nay, dear enchantress, I consider naught, Save mine own ignorance, which would be taught. The Lady. Dost thou persist? Pierrot. I do entreat this boon! (She bends forward, their lips meet: she withdraws with a petulant shiver. She utters a peal of clear laughter.) The Lady. Why art thou pale, fond lover of the moon? Pierrot. Cold are thy lips, more cold than I can tell; Yet would I hang on them, thine icicle! Cold is thy kiss, more cold than I could dream Arctus sits, watching the Boreal stream: But with its frost such sweetness did conspire That all my veins are filled with running fire; Never I knew that life contained such bliss As the divine completeness of a kiss. The Lady. Apt scholar! so love's lesson has been taught, Warning, as usual, has gone for naught. Pierrot. Had all my schooling been of this soft kind, To play the truant I were less inclined. Teach me again! I am a sorry dunce— I never knew a task by conning once. The Lady. Then come with me! below this pleasant shrine Of Venus we will presently recline, Until birds' twitter beckon me away To mine own home, beyond the milky-way. I will instruct thee, for I deem as yet Of Love thou knowest but the alphabet. Pierrot. In its sweet grammar I shall grow most wise, If all its rules be written in thine eyes. (The lady sits upon a step of the temple, and Pierrot leans upon his elbow at her feet, regarding her.) Pierrot. Sweet contemplation! how my senses yearn To be thy scholar always, always learn. Hold not so high from me thy radiant mouth, Fragrant with all the spices of the South; Nor turn, O sweet! thy golden face away, For with it goes the light of all my day. Let me peruse it, till I know by rote Each line of it, like music, note by note; Raise thy long lashes, Lady! smile again: These studies profit me. (Taking her hand.) The Lady. Refrain, refrain! Pierrot (With passion). I am but studious, so do not stir; Thou art my star, I thine astronomer! Geometry was founded on thy lip. (Kisses her hand.) The Lady. This attitude becomes not scholarship! Thy zeal I praise; but, prithee, not so fast, Nor leave the rudiments until the last. Science applied is good, but t'were a schism To study such before the catechism. Bear thee more modestly, while I submit Some easy problems to confirm thy wit. Pierrot. In all humility my mind I pit Against her problems which would test my wit. The Lady (Questioning him from a little book bound deliciously in vellum). What is Love? Is it a folly, Is it mirth, or melancholy? Joys above, Are there many, or not any? What is love? Pierrot (Answering in a very humble attitude of scholarship). If you please, A most sweet folly! Full of mirth and melancholy: Both of these! In its sadness worth all gladness, If you please! The Lady. Prithee where, Goes Love a-hiding? Is he long in his abiding Anywhere? Can you bind him when you find him; Prithee, where? Pierrot. With spring days Love comes and dallies: Upon the mountains, through the valleys Lie Love's ways. Then he leaves you and deceives you In spring days. The Lady. Thine answers please me: 'tis thy turn to ask. To meet thy questioning be now my task. Pierrot. Since I know thee, dear Immortal, Is my heart become a blossom, To be worn upon thy bosom. When thou turn me from this portal, Whither shall I, hapless mortal, Seek love out and win again Heart of me that thou retain? The Lady. In and out the woods and valleys, Circling, soaring like a swallow, Love shall flee and thou shalt follow: Though he stops awhile and dallies, Never shalt thou stay his malice! Moon-kissed mortals seek in vain To possess their hearts again! Pierrot. Tell me, Lady, shall I never Rid me of this grievous burden! Follow Love and find his guerdon In no maiden whatsoever? Wilt thou hold my heart for ever? Rather would I thine forget, In some earthly Pierrette! The Lady. Thus thy fate, whate'er thy will is! Moon-struck child, go seek my traces Vainly in all mortal faces! In and out among the lilies, Court each rural Amaryllis: Seek the signet of Love's hand In each courtly Corisande! Pierrot. Now, verily, sweet maid, of school I tire: These answers are not such as I desire. The Lady. Why art thou sad? Pierrot. I dare not tell. The Lady (Caressingly). Come, say! Pierrot. Is love all schooling, with no time to play? The Lady. Though all love's lessons be a holiday, Yet I will humour thee: what wouldst thou play? Pierrot. What are the games that small moon-maids enjoy, Or is their time all spent in staid employ? The Lady. Sedate they are, yet games they much enjoy: They skip with stars, the rainbow is their toy. Pierrot. That is too hard! The Lady. For mortal's play. Pierrot. What then? The Lady. Teach me some pastime from the world of men. Pierrot. I have it, maiden. The Lady. Can it soon be taught? Pierrot. A simple game, I learnt it at the Court. I sit by thee. The Lady. But, prithee, not so near. Pierrot. That is essential, as will soon appear. Lay here thine hand, which cold night dews anoint, Washing its white— The Lady. Now is this to the point? Pierrot. Prithee, forbear! Such is the game's design. The Lady. Here is my hand. Pierrot. I cover it with mine. The Lady. What must I next? (They play.) Pierrot. Withdraw. The Lady. It goes too fast. (They continue playing, until Pierrot catches her hand.) Pierrot (Laughing). Tis done. I win my forfeit at the last. (He tries to embrace her. She escapes; he chases her round the stage; she eludes him.) The Lady. Thou art not quick enough. Who hopes to catch A moon-beam, must use twice as much despatch. Pierrot (Sitting down sulkily). I grow aweary, and my heart is sore. Thou dost not love me; I will play no more. (He buries his face in his hands: the lady stands over him.) The Lady. What is this petulance? Pierrot. 'Tis quick to tell— Thou hast but mocked me. The Lady. Nay! I love thee well! Pierrot. Repeat those words, for still within my breast A whisper warns me they are said in jest. The Lady. I jested not: at daybreak I must go, Yet loving thee far better than thou know. Pierrot. Then, by this altar, and this sacred shrine, Take my sworn troth, and swear thee wholly mine! The gods have wedded mortals long ere this. The Lady. There was enough betrothal in my kiss. What need of further oaths? Pierrot. That bound not thee! The Lady. Peace! since I tell thee that it may not be. But sit beside me whilst I soothe thy bale With some moon fancy or celestial tale. Pierrot. Tell me of thee, and that dim, happy place Where lies thine home, with maidens of thy race! The Lady (Seating herself). Calm is it yonder, very calm; the air For mortals' breath is too refined and rare; Hard by a green lagoon our palace rears Its dome of agate through a myriad years. A hundred chambers its bright walls enthrone, Each one carved strangely from a precious stone. Within the fairest, clad in purity, Our mother dwelleth immemorially: Moon-calm, moon-pale, with moon stones on her gown The floor she treads with little pearls is sown; She sits upon a throne of amethysts, And orders mortal fortunes as she lists; I, and my sisters, all around her stand, And, when she speaks, accomplish her demand. Pierrot. Methought grim Clotho and her sisters twain With shrivelled fingers spun this web of bane! The Lady. Their's and my mother's realm is far apart; Her's is the lustrous kingdom of the heart, And dreamers all, and all who sing and love, Her power acknowledge, and her rule approve. Pierrot. Me, even me, she hath led into this grove. The Lady. Yea, thou art one of hers! But, ere this night, Often I watched my sisters take their flight Down heaven's stairway of the clustered stars To gaze on mortals through their lattice bars; And some in sleep they woo with dreams of bliss Too shadowy to tell, and some they kiss. But all to whom they come, my sisters say, Forthwith forget all joyance of the day, Forget their laughter and forget their tears, And dream away with singing all their years— Moon-lovers always! (She sighs.) Pierrot. Why art sad, sweet Moon? (Laughing.) The Lady. For this, my story, grant me now a boon. Pierrot. I am thy servitor. The Lady. Would, then, I knew More of the earth, what men and women do. Pierrot. I will explain. The Lady. Let brevity attend Thy wit, for night approaches to its end. Pierrot. Once was I a page at Court, so trust in me: That's the first lesson of society. The Lady. Society? Pierrot. I mean the very best Pardy! thou wouldst not hear about the rest. I know it not, but am a petit maître At rout and festival and bal champêtre. But since example be instruction's ease, Let's play the thing.—Now, Madame, if you please! (He helps her to rise, and leads her forward: then he kisses her hand, bowing over it with a very courtly air.) The Lady. What am I, then? Pierrot. A most divine Marquise! Perhaps that attitude hath too much ease. (Passes her.) Ah, that is better! To complete the plan, Nothing is necessary save a fan. The Lady. Cool is the night, what needs it? Pierrot. Madame, pray Reflect, it is essential to our play. The Lady (Taking a lily). Here is my fan! Pierrot. So, use it with intent: The deadliest arm in beauty's armament! The Lady. What do we next? Pierrot. We talk! The Lady. But what about? Pierrot. We quiz the company and praise the rout; Are polished, petulant, malicious, sly, Or what you will, so reputations die. Observe the Duchess in Venetian lace, With the red eminence. The Lady. A pretty face! Pierrot. For something tarter set thy wits to search— ‘She loves the churchman better than the church.’ The Lady. Her blush is charming; would it were her own! Pierrot. Madame is merciless! The Lady. Is that the tone? Pierrot. The very tone: I swear thou lackest naught, Madame was evidently bred at Court. The Lady. Thou speakest glibly: 'tis not of thine age. Pierrot. I listened much, as best becomes a page. The Lady. I like thy Court but little— Pierrot. Hush! the Queen! Bow, but not low—thou knowest what I mean. The Lady. Nay, that I know not! Pierrot. Though she wear a crown, 'Tis from La Pompadour one fears a frown. The Lady. Thou art a child: thy malice is a game. Pierrot. A most sweet pastime—scandal is its name. The Lady. Enough, it wearies me. Pierrot. Then, rare Marquise, Desert the crowd to wander through the trees. (He bows low, and she curtsies; they move round the stage. When they pass before the Statue he seizes her hand and falls on his knee.) The Lady. What wouldst thou now? Pierrot. Ah, prithee, what, save thee! The Lady. Was this included in thy comedy? Pierrot. Ah, mock me not! In vain with quirk and jest I strive to quench the passion in my breast; In vain thy blandishments would make me play: Still I desire far more than I can say. My knowledge halts, ah, sweet, be piteous, Instruct me still, while time remains to us, Be what thou wist, Goddess, moon-maid, Marquise, So that I gather from thy lips heart's ease, Nay, I implore thee, think thee how time flies! The Lady. Hush! I beseech thee, even now night dies. Pierrot. Night, day, are one to me for thy soft sake. (He entreats her with imploring gestures, she hesitates: then puts her finger on her lip, hushing him.) The Lady. It is too late, for hark! the birds awake. Pierrot. The birds awake! It is the voice of day! The Lady. Farewell, dear youth! They summon me away. (The light changes, it grows daylight: and music imitates the twitter of the birds. They stand gazing at the morning: then Pierrot sinks back upon his bed, he covers his face in his hands.) The Lady (Bending over him). Music, my maids! His weary senses steep In soft untroubled and oblivious sleep, With mandragore anoint his tirèd eyes, That they may open on mere memories, Then shall a vision seem his lost delight, With love, his lady for a summer's night. Dream thou hast dreamt all this, when thou awake, Yet still be sorrowful, for a dream's sake. I leave thee, sleeper! Yea, I leave thee now, Yet take my legacy upon thy brow: Remember me, who was compassionate, And opened for thee once, the ivory gate. I come no more, thou shalt not see my face When I am gone to mine exalted place: Yet all thy days are mine, dreamer of dreams, All silvered over with the moon's pale beams: Go forth and seek in each fair face in vain, To find the image of thy love again. All maids are kind to thee, yet never one Shall hold thy truant heart till day be done. Whom once the moon has kissed, loves long and late, Yet never finds the maid to be his mate. Farewell, dear sleeper, follow out thy fate. (The Moon Maiden withdraws: a song is sung from behind: it is full day.) The Moon Maiden's Song Sleep! Cast thy canopy Over this sleeper's brain, Dim grow his memory, When he awake again. Love stays a summer night, Till lights of morning come; Then takes her wingèd flight Back to her starry home. Sleep! Yet thy days are mine; Love's seal is over thee: Far though my ways from thine, Dim though thy memory. Love stays a summer night, Till lights of morning come; Then takes her wingèd flight Back to her starry home. (When the song is finished, the curtain falls upon Pierrot sleeping.) The End SECTIONS FROM LA PUCELLE EXTRACT FROM CANTO XIII [A glorious spectacle now rose to view, The age of pleasure and of wonders too, Great Louis and his sumptuous court now move, Where all the arts were instigate by love. Love reared the structure of Versailles renowned, By Love the dazzled multitudes were crowned, From flowery couch Love formed great Louis' throne, Spite of the clash of arms and battle's groan; Love, to the chief and sun of all his court Led the most charming rivals to resort, Impatient all and glowing with desire; First Mazarin's fair niece, her eyes on fire, Then generous and tender Vallière, Then Montespan, more proud and debonnaire. One yielding to ecstatic rapture's power, The other waiting pleasure's promised hour.] A metamorphosis his vision had; In long black cloak lugubriously clad, Love casts aside the roses from his hair And hides his forehead 'neath a bonnet square. White silly Scruple, icy Decency. Conceal his traits of smiling infancy. Him follows Hymen on mysterious feet: His torches twain flame out with equal heat, Fires without glow, whose chilly flames and white Fatigue the places they pretend to light. By these sad candles' flickering unkind, With pimps and eke a priest, who go behind, Great Louis, poppy-crowned and cassock led Proceeds his ancient Harridan to wed. He, who of Bourbons, far surpassed the rest, The monk sees cozened by a flabby breast, Upon a couch he stirs his aged nag; Love is in tears and all his faithful tag: To Paphos all the games and laughter fly, Paris, the Court are all for piety. A lechery as brutal as intense Is all the pleasure now that's left to sense. The air grows dense, and cynic wits maintain Diogenes', not Epicurus' reign. In deep extremes of drunkenness obscure The courtier seeks his freedom to procure; Cassocked Hercules, Priapus in a cloak, Upon the palace lay their obscene yolk; To this disgusting pair all hommage tends, Whom sheer brutality alone commends, Beauty and grace at their good pleasure dance; Such is the end of gentle love in France, When Providential care or Destiny, The bigot king laid with his ancestry. The monk then saw the Regent's happy time; The pleasant reign of license had its prime, As folly tinkling loud her bells in hand With lightsome step tripped over Gallia's land, When pious men as simple fools appear, Soft Argenton and joyous Parabère! 'Tis through your care, Cythera's god once more, In Orléans' palace, men again adore, About his shrines once more the incense blows. The god of Taste, the one compeer Love knows, To genius seeks to join all charms that please. Fauns and Priapus, brutal Hercules Are forced to make the Convents their retreat, Nor dare in merry France to take their seat. CANTO XVII CORISANDRE My reader by experience is acquaint That the fair god, whom as a child they paint, (Though childish games are hardly all his sport) Hath quivers two, of very different sort. The one holds arrows, whose entrancing sting Is felt with little risk or suffering; These grow with time, and penetrate the heart, Leaving the lively wounds they there impart. Like raging fire, his other arrows fly, Swift from the bow and burning instantly, On senses five destruction fell they wreak, With lively red illuminate the cheek; With a new blood, men feel their bodies fired, And with new being, hold themselves inspired. Nothing they understand, their eyes are bright, Gesture and action follow their mad flight. Waters which boil tumultuous on the fire, Which, o'er the copper's brink, rise and retire, Which run away and leap and fall and waltz, Are but an image, incomplete and false, Of love's fierce fire, when once it agitates: You know it, brethren mine, and all its states! But this capricious god, our light love's king, Contrived anon a far more pleasant thing: Betwixt Cutendre and Blois, he caused to dwell A beauteous maid, whose aspect amiable Had left the charms of Agnes far behind, If, with her beauty, her heart had been kind. (A kind heart's worth much beauty in a dame!) Foolish and young, Corisandre was her name. Love's will it was, each king or cavalier, Young bachelor or magistrate severe, Should seek, grown foolish, being overfond With this fair idiot a closer bond; Servants, the people and the viler herd Alone exempt were from this law absurd; Gentle or kingly race one had to own Thus to grow mad. Nor was it that alone: The healing art, as much hemp as you will, Brought little help and succour 'gainst this ill; And worse and worse the brain would daily grow, Till the fair fool would some complaisance show, And such a time in destiny was writ That, at the last, she might attain to wit. On Loire's banks nurtured, lovers, more than one, For Corisandre's sight, were all undone; One, losing memory and sense, for food Just as a stag, would pasture in the wood; And one would think his buttocks were of glass, And being jostled by the folk who pass, Would weep because his back-side had been broke. Goyon is sure he is of female folk, Wears petticoats and dies of his despairs, Because, to truss them up no lover cares: A saddle Valori takes, by no means light; He thinks himself an ass—is doubtless right— Asks for his load, and ceases not to bray. Sablé, transformed into a saucepot's way, On three feet walks; upon the ground, one hand, And one bow-legged. Alas, in this our land, Amongst the madmen we might well have been, Though the fair Corisandre we ne'er had seen. Who is the sapient wit, who has not once, Through his desires, been proved a very dunce? Who has not had a check? In prose or verse, All men are madmen, if they are not worse. Now Corisandre a grandmother possessed, Though stiff, a worthy dame by all confessed, Whose pride, though she concealed it in the shade, Was to behold the fools her daughter made. But scruples 'gan her mind at last to urge, Sorry she was for such a dismal scourge. Her daughter then so fatal to the mind, Within an hidden chamber she confined. Before the castle she took care to place Custodians two, with a forbidding face, Ready the house's entrance to maintain Against all comers, who would risk their brain. The foolish Fair, to such seclusion brought, Sang, sewed, embroidered, very little thought, Regret or care, not e'en the least desire Moved her to heal her lovers' maddened fire, Though had the beauty had this tenderness, All it had cost her, would be to say Yes. The haughty Chandos, in high anger still That his proud combatant had 'scaped his skill, Straight to his Britons in his wrath returns; E'en as the hound, whose savage jaw which yearns Has snapped in vain at the escaping hare, Turns, while his yelps of anger rend the air, Then to his master with slow steps will go, Head hanging down, and long tail drooping low. Well his unworthy animal he cursed Who, in soft duel, brought him off the worst. His general withal, hastes to supply A youthful colonel, happening to be by; Bold Irishman, by name Paul Tirconel, Whose chest was broad, who bore himself right well, As stout of arm as limb, with iron spine, Whose haughty brow was sealed with the consign Of one who never such affronts would face, As now made Chandos redden in disgrace. This martial pair, with gallant throng behind, The gates of Corisandre's house now find; They seek to enter, when the porters cry: ‘We bid you halt; bethink you ere you try To enter here and Corisandre behold, If you would wish what wits you have to hold.’ Proud Chandos this a further insult deems, Onward he rushes, while his fury teems; With one straight blow, he sends twelve yards away One porter, with his arm put out of play; Aching and bruised he lies upon the sand. Paul Tirconel, with no less ruthless hand, Spurs on his fiery steed and whips him twice, Presses his knees, lets rein and in a trice The courser like a lightning flash has sped, And passes o'er the other porter's head; Lifting his front, a moment still he gazed, A moment rests astonished and amazed, Then turning round receives a doughty blow, Which, like his erstwhile colleague, lays him low. So in the province, some gay officer, A dandy, natty, fond of sport and stir, Runs to the play amain, the porter beats And, without paying, from his ravished seats He hisses everything he contemplates. The English suite within the courtyard swarm; The ancient Dame descends in high alarm, While Corisandre, affrighted at the noise, Her kirtle dons and from her room deploys. Chandos addresses her a salute short, True Englishman! much speech was not his forte; But when he saw a face so innocent, That lily-skin, those charms so succulent, Those budding breasts and arms of ivory, Which nature's hands had rounded artfully, A happy chance he vowed was his to seize; When Corisandre, with mien not quite at ease, Casts him a glance which little seemed to say. For Paul Tirconel, in his courteous way, Saluted both the daughter and the dame, And ogled in his turn and felt love's flame. What happened then? Alas, fell madness came. Chandos, affected by that malady, As horse-dealer, native of Normandy, The youthful fair declares to be a horse, Who must be saddled, mounted in due course, He whips her fleshly saddle with a crack, And in a trice is mounted on her back. The fair cries out, and under Chandos falls. Paul Tirconel, whom different mania calls, A tavern-keeper holds himself to be, And takes the fair, who's crouched upon her knee, For a fat tun of wine, which he must bore, Good wine and lees from th'orifice to draw. Still straddling her, Chandos cries out: ‘Have done, God dam! You're mad, I think the evil one Has crossed your wits; you cannot even tell From tun of wine, my white mare Isabel!...’ ‘It is my tun, my tap's occasion.’ ‘It is my horse...’ ‘My brother, 'tis my tun...’ Both were exactly certain they were right, And for their mad opinion fain to fight, With just such fire, as monks in angry vein, Devotion of their scapular maintain, Or d'Olivet upholds his Cicero. Swift contradictions rattle to and fro, And certain words, which, thank my modesty, I spare my readers' ears; vocabulary Which, loathed by proper pride, our Britons famed, Who vaunt their sabres, look on unashamed. As winds, which gather force, though erstwhile weak, Are roused and growl and fragile vessels break, Which toss too much the waters to withstand, Horror is shed by them o'er all the land— So our two Englishmen at first were viewed In laughter's semblance and a joking mood; Then vexed, delirious fancies on them steal, They both rush on, determined death to deal. Both are on guard, in a like posture shown, With outstretched arms and bodies forward thrown, In quart, in tierce, their tough skins they attack. But soon all rule and measure 'gin to lack, As hotter still, and fiercer, more incensed With slashing blows of the keen steel they fenced. Less fierce in Etna's forge the one-eyed crew, Out of the anvil, fiery sparks pursue, Beneath less heavy hammers, who prepare For thunder's master his big cannon there. On every side blood casts a lavish stain, From neck and arm and from the riven brain, But not one cry succeeded to the wound; The worthy dame would cure them sans a sound, To strip them of their armour she desired, A Pater said, a confessor required: Her daughter all the time, with languid view, Bridled and sought her coiffure to renew. Our British pair, exhausted, drenched in gore, Were lying both full length upon the floor, When who should come but the great King of France With all his gallant knights, who bore the lance, And those bright fair, within his court, who throve Worthy of Mars and of the God of Love. Beholding these, the beauteous Fool draws nigh, And humbly drops a clumsy curtesy, Bids them good day with utter nonchalance, And looks at all things with indifference. Who e'er had thought that nature would admit Poison so much in eyes so lacking wit. The beauty even hardly deigns to glance At the distracted, handsome heads of France. Heaven sheds its benign graces every day, Which mortals take in very different way; All things are fashioned to the time and place, And very diverse are the effects of grace. The self-same sap when nourished in the earth, Of divers fruits the essences of birth, Produces pinks, the thistle and the rose; And d'Argens sighs when d'Arget laughter knows. Maupertuis of folly's as prolific As Newton of his theories scientific. A certain king to use his soldiers knows As often for his loves as 'gainst his foes. All's variable; and in a different strain Function the British and the Gallic brain: Each one the customs of his country fits; With Englishmen, of hard and sombre wits, Madness is atrabilious, black as night; But with the French, it lively is and light. Our folk the hands of one and other seize, Dance in a ring, sing choruses that please. The fat Bonneau exertions makes immense, Though just as scant of breath as of cadence; While Father Bonifoux, psalter in hand, Dances with slower steps with the mad band; Him doth the page, above the rest, beguile, Though by his pious language and his smile, His accent, gestures and his eyes so kind, It seemed the Father had a rag of mind. That novel ill which fascinates the view Of this most royal and fantastic crew, Leads them the castle's great court-yard to deem A garden, wherein flows a pleasant stream. They wish to bathe, their clothes and corslets pass, And nakedly disport them on the grass, Swim in the void, and lift aloft the chin, Thinking clear water covers them within. The monk, the while he swam, 'tis meet to note, From the enchanting page was ne'er remote. At such a mass of noddles without brain, Such nudity, our modest fair with pain, The Maid and Agnes and fair Dorothy Discreetly turned their head and shut the eye, Then looked again, then after once again Eyes, heart and hand to the celestial plain. ‘Have I then come’, cried Joan, ‘to such a pass? I have St. Denis for me and mine ass; And many an impious Briton I have braved, Avenged my prince, and many a convent saved; T'wards Orléans' walls my stressful way I've ta'en; And Destiny must make my labour vain— Our heroes mad?’ Agnes and Dorothy Contained themselves with certain difficulty; Sometimes they laughed, sometimes were passing sad To see great kings and noble heroes mad. But what to do? Where fly? Oh, whither get? Cutendre's castle they might well regret; Had not a servant, of her secret lore, Taught them the art wits wandering to restore. ‘Good sense once lost,’ she said, ‘'tis Fate's decree, To brains whence it has flown, restored can be, Only when Corisandre the fair will deign In snares of love to let herself be ta'en.’ This good advice was not without avail, The muleteer to heed it did not fail: Doubtless you know that lecher of remark Was always amorous of Joan of Arc, And jealous of the ass, discreet of walk, That Amazon he never ceased to stalk. When thus he heard, in confidence arrayed, He starts forthwith his King and France to aid. Just in a corner chanced the fair to lie, Whom from afar he had been pleased to spy; T'wards her he runs, well armed with fire and rage. They thought him mad, who was the only sage. O muleteer! on thee what treasures rare Kind nature had bestowed with partial care, Thy lowly fortune compensating well. With one swift bound he subjugates the belle. To her, in fine, the pleasing moment came To learn and know; and scarce was lit that flame Of pleasure, whereof previous ignorance In her young soul had dulled intelligence, Than the enchaunting spell prevails no more, And every brain is almost as before; Almost I say, for there was slight mistake. King Charles, forsooth, the sturdy sense must take Of old Bonneau, who, for his part received Wits of the monk; and thus were all deceived. Little advantage came of this exchange; The human reason, God's great gift, 'tis strange, Is a small thing, but grudgingly bestowed, And every mortal's content with his load. So change had with the lovers no effect; Each one preserved for his fair dame elect His former taste and sweet significance: And what has love to do with common sense? For Corisandre, new knowledge she procured Of good and ill; a confidence assured Of art and taste, an excellent reward For all her previous innocence ignored; All this the presents of a muleteer! Thus Adam's silly partner, so we hear, In garden lived and pleasure came not near, Until the Devil hove within her sight, And made her charming, subtile, witty, light, As are the women whom to day we meet, Who have no need the Devil to entreat. CANTO XXI Now must I tell what consequences sad Conculix' most disgraceful conduct had; What to audacious Tirconel befell, What succour strange and salutary as well Our Reverend friar was able to entreat For Dorothy, and for the Sorel sweet, And with what art he set them safe and free. With what a fire and what dexterity, Maid from Dunois was ravished by the ass, And how God's vengeance on him came to pass, Who had, with Satan's help, defiled the Maid. But before all, 'tis Orléans siege arrayed, Where many warriors brave clashed arms and fell, 'Tis there we need to let our interest dwell. O God of Love! O power by frailty known! O fatal Love! how nearly hadst thou thrown That citadel of France in hostile hands, Success unhoped of those who hate our lands. What Bedford, in experience grown old, And Talbot sought to do, albeit bold, And failed at last, O Love, thou wouldst attain! Reader, reflect, their fatal flames of bane Your bodies burn, and sore your souls beguile. Dear child! thou workest ruin with a smile. In that sad land, while Love his arrows flings, Where hundred heroes struggled for two Kings, His tender hand, months since wrought grievous smart On mighty Talbot with a golden dart, That in the first of his two sheaves he found. It was before that siege so long renowned, An armistice, alas too short, they make; Louvet and he, in peace their supper take; This Louvet, president of worthy fame, Was rash enough to bid to sup his dame. Madame inclined somewhat to play the prude; Wherefore Love thought her pride should be subdued. For prudes he hates and oft will them abase. Thus he deranged the sternness of her face, Her noble dignity he changed indeed, For certain traits which unto madness lead. Dame President, on this auspicious day, Great Talbot wins and charms his wits away. You've seen already that grim escalade, Assault of blood, and horrid cannonade, Those brave attempts, and all those desperate fights, Within, without, and on the ramparts' heights; When Talbot and his fiery following train The ramparts and the gates had burst and ta'en; When on them from the houses' tops there broke Sword, flame and grisly death at one fell stroke. Then fiery Talbot, with his agile walk, Tramples the dying, through the town to stalk, He upset all things, crying out aloud: ‘My Britons, enter and disarm the crowd!’ Much he resembled then to war's great god, Beneath his footsteps echoing the sod, When Discord and Bellona and high Fate, As minister of Death arm him with hate. Dame President within her walls a breach That looked upon a ruined cot, could reach; And through this hole her gallant could espy, His golden helm, where feathers curl and fly, His mailed arm, and those live sparks of flame, Which from his pupils' orbits darting came, That carriage proud, that demi-god's great air; Dame President was almost in despair; With shame dumbfounded and bereft of wits: As once, when in her grated stage box sits That erst famed beauty love has sore inflamed, And ogles Baron, actor justly famed. With ardent eyes she feasts upon his face, His rich adornment, gestures and his grace, Mingled with his her accents in tones low, Love's flames received, her senses owned the glow. Unable to resist, Dame President, Consumed by passion, calls her confidant: ‘Run, Suson, fly, and when you find him, say, O bid him come and lead me hence away! Convey to him, if him you can not find That he take pity on my lot unkind; That if he be a worthy, gallant knight, I'll sup with him, within his house to-night.’ The confidant dispatched a little page; It was her brother; well he earned his wage; With no delay six hardy lackeys call At Louvet's house, and force the outer wall. They enter and a woman masked they see, Painted and patched, with many a coquetry, Her hair or true or false raised to a bow, On either side in curls was rayed below. They take her up; she vanished from view, By secret paths which the brave Talbot knew. The handsome Talbot on that famous day Through so much blood and fire had made his way, That on the eve in dalliance with Love's charms, He would forget the trouble of his arms. Each mighty hero, though he win or lose, To sup with a fair dame, would rather choose. Thus Talbot, who has suffered no defeat, Awaits within his house his lady sweet. All things are ready for a supper fine; The chased glass flagons of the rarest wine Twixt lumps of cooling ice are there to tap, Those liquid rubies, and that brilliant sap, Which Citeaux' blessed cellars hoard and hide; In the proud tent, upon the other side, A sofa, elegantly shaped, is placed, Soft, low and wide, with proper fittings graced, With back inclined, and two supports incased. There our two lovers at their will could play; Sir Talbot 'gan to live in the French way. His care was first forthwith, the fair to find, Who to his wooing had proved passing kind. All things around him of his lady tell. They bring her in, she's introduced as well. A monster gray, in childish ruffs and frills, Just three feet high, not to forget her heels. Her little eyes with lively red ornate, Yellow effusions ever inundate; Her broad flat nose, twisted and turned within Seems to drop straight upon her long hooked chin. The Devil's mistress, Talbot thinks to take; He utters cries at which the tables shake. It was fat Louvet's sister whom had brought The guard when in his house his wife they sought; She strutted round with pride and pleasure spent, In rich delight at such a ravishment. Dame President the direst grief assailed; To think how her high enterprise had failed, She quite lost heart at this misreckoning, And cursed her sister like a Valois King. Already love had troubled sore her wit, 'Twas worse now jealousy had part in it, Her troubled mind was lit with further flame, And madder than before she now became.</field>
