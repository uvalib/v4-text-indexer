Remember Adams fall How we were condemned all In hell perpetuall there for to dwell. 3 Remember Gods goodnesse O thou man, O thou man, Remember Gods goodnesse And his promise made. Remember Gods goodnesse, How he sent his sonne doubtlesse Our sinnes for to redresse, be not affraid. 4 The Angels all did sing, O thou man, O thou man. The Angels all did sing Vpon the Shepheards hill. The Angels all did singe Praises to our heauenly King, And peace to man liuing with a good will. 5 The shepheards amazed was, O thou man, O thou man. The shepheards amazed was To heare the Angels sing, The shepheards amazed was How it should come to passe That Christ our Messias should be our King. 6 To Bethlem did they goe, O thou man, O thou man, To Bethlem did they go The shepheards three, To Bethlem did they goe To see where it were so or no, Whether Christ were borne or no to set man free. 7 As the Angels before did say, O thou man, O thou man, As the Angels before did say, So it came to passe, As the Angels before did say, They found a babe whereas it lay In a manger wrapt in hay, so poore he was. 8 In Bethlem he was borne, O thou man, O thou man, In Bethlem he was borne, For mankind sake, In Bethlem he was borne For vs that were forlorne, And therefore tooke no scorn our flesh to take. 9 Giue thanks to God alway, O thou man, O thou man, Giue thanks to God alway With heart most ioyfully, Giue thankes to God alway, For this our happy day, Let all men sing and say holy, holy.
