      <field name="fulltext">TO THE HONOVRABLE AND TRVLY GENEROUS, the Lord of Colrane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend Mr. Charles Aleyn upon his learned Poëme. The noblest spurre unto the sonnes of fame, Is thirst of honour, and to have their name Enrold in faithfull History: thus worth Was by a wise ambition first brought forth. Blest Edward whom posterity shall know By this unspotted worke, to which we owe Our knowledge of thy choisest deeds: so just Has bin my freind unto thy reverend dust. Truth is the Historians crowne, and Art Squares it to stricter comelinesse: each part Thou skilfully observ'st, whose learned sleight Shall teach succeeding ages how to write. Goe on t'improove the world, and scorne the harme That malice can finde out, desert's a charme. Be fortunate as knowing, may thy braine Iove-like bring forth valour and wit, disdaine Those torturers of wit that stuffe these time With rude composures, and unseason'd rimes. It will be weaknesse to inlarge thy praise, Thy owne judicious Poeme is thy bayes. Iohn Hall. To my freind Mr. Charles Aleyn. Charles, by thy Muse Edward the Black seems faire, The daring sonne of an undanted Sire. Live not my hopes, if I can judge more rare Their acts, or thy expression. To require An equall censure, this with truth accords, They give thee matter, thou afford'st them words. Iohn Lewis. To his honoured Friend M?. Charles Aleyn of his Battailes. Fame that did sing the glory of that day, When those two Kings their banners did display, And in her eares for jewels hang their praise, Would higher if she could thy glory raise. Both parts are done so well, that Martiall men Scarce know who acted best, the sword, or pen. For thy cleere fancy hath shap'd things so right, That he that reads thy booke, shall see the fight. So lively thou hast drawne the face of feare, That one would think thou hadst been present there. Grones, wounds, &amp; death so well thy Muse can paint, That when a coward reads it, he will faint. Doubt not of praise; let venom'd Envy pine, Fame gave their heads the Laurell, and will thine. Gilb. W. To his much esteemed Friend M? Charles Aleyn, on his Battaile of Crescey. Proud Fame doth speake her meaner tales, but sings This more majestick strugling of Kings, And of these Worthies; from whose mighty strife Honour her patterne takes, Valour her life. She layes her Trumpet by; thy Muse supplies That shrill and empty noise, with dying cries: Whose ruthfull accents on each faile of breath, Tune hymnes to daring soules, in noates of death. Bellona doth Apollo's rage inspire, And from the dint of swords strikes active fire; Wherewith thy kindled straines, dry Lethes waves, And lighten our great Edwards in their graves. The father joy'd, who high Directour stood, While his fierce sonne, imbru'd in Gallick blood, Hew'd troopes in peeces, as if fury would Vnmake mankinde: no lesse triumph could Appease that Lion rage, whose potent charmes Gave early vigour to his youthfull armes. Thy Bayes advance his Sword, his Sword thy Bayes; So joynes with Mars his dread, thy Muses praise. Readers thy Battaile doe best praises lend, In fearfull tremblings, and their hayre on end. Henry Blount. THE BATTAILE OF CRESCEY. Tis true, my hand our Edwards cann't enrowle In honours brazen leaves; nor draw a line In their fam'd table, unlesse Homers soule Were made by wondrous transmigration mine. I car'd not though Pythagoras did misse In all Philosophy, if true in this. Yet when I shall have drawne some Genius forth, Whose high-borne streines are priviledg'd from time, Who in the handling of a theme of worth, May drowne fames trumpet with a mighty rime, Twill be some comfort, when my light is done, It was the Phosphorus unto the Sunne. Sure Edward's old enough: why then will France Still under-rate him as one under age? His yeeres lay claime to his inheritance; He hath tooke forth out of his pupilage. Perhaps De Valois in a courteous hate, Is loth to trouble him with his owne estate. The Norwey Oke, when 'twas a tender twig, Homag'd to every blast; but when 'tis growne, It dares the windes: and this Heroick Sprig, When yong, was dislocated from his owne: But now confirm'd in growth, and breathing man, France shall be taught, he needs no Guardian. For otherwise it might be well conceiv'd, Edward was unfit heire, if that a Realme, Which from his Grandsire Philip was deriv'd, Must not have him, but others at the helme. A birthright's deere, and if the French will try it, And Edward sell it, it is blood must buy it. Philip of Valois doth alledge succession, And Edward makes succession his plea; Both urge same titles for the same possession: But Edward neerer stands by a degree. In a right line the right on Edward fals. But Philip stands with the collaterals. Indeed the Salicque law thinkes no Crowne fit For Edwards mothers head: yet Edwards owne By just descent doth well consort with it; Not for her sonne, but selfe, she's barr'd the Crowne, That life which to his right his Grandsire gives, Dies in his mother, in himselfe relives. Here Edward thinkes it time to draw his sword, For that undrawne cuts his successive line; And natures law this Canon doth afford, Thou may'st with justice vindicate what's thine. Tis nat'rall equity: great Edward then Had fought with nature, if not fought with men. And though succession stood not for the cause, There's something else in natures pandects writ, Proclaimes this war, a just one by her lawes; For natures dimmer light doth favour it. For she our selves unto our selves commends, Nor bids us suffer what our foe intends. Nature hath taught even beasts some skill in armes, Some pretty art of war, some trick in fight, Some cunning posture to avert their harmes, And make their owne revenge in their owne right. He's in mans lowest forme that cannot learne, And con a lesson which even beasts discerne. Shall Edward num'd with a cold lethargy, See France exasperate the rebellious Scot? The Scot which earst had vow'd him fealty; Shall Edward winke, and say he saw it not? Who must not onely be spectator here, But actor upon honours theater? In Aquitane France violates his rites, Infests his country, takes his cities there, And in a well-prepared fleet affrights With royall piracies our Ilands here Not to encounter wrongs that would undoe us, Makes them our guests, &amp; bids them welcom to us. But Edwards feares are marching neerer home; France to his root the axe is now applying, (As he had certified the See of Rome) And swords are now in distance of discrying. Then meet them Edward, and in time contest; Preventing Physick ever was the best. Seven mouthed Nilus in his unknowne head Might well be nipt: but when he shall enlarge His growing selfe in a more spacious bed, Twill pose Alcides to attempt the charge. Let not thy foe still passe without controwling, Like fame &amp; snowbals he'le get strength by rowling But where will Edward meet to try this prize? Himselfe said England should not be the stage; The Theory of war did this advise, In France to lay his selfe and state at gage. I had rather see a scarfire quench'd in thine, Or in Vcalegons lodgings than in mine. Edward's in Flanders now, in Flanders lets His rights be publish'd, and his letters sent To the adjoyning townes; some letters sets On their Church doores, bearing the same intent The cause and patron he will not dissever, God and his right are married for ever. Flanders is his, provided he will beare The French kings title; for she thinketh so To guild her fact, because she once did sweare, Never against the King of France to goe. By this ambiguous trick she doth dispence Both with her oath, and with her conscience. Edward before did beare two flowers de Lis, Now the whole armes the law of armes will yeeld; He quartereth their armory with his, The Lions and the Lilies in one field. You'll say, the Lilies spin not; there's no need, Tis blood is to be drawne, and not a thred. France with an equall forwardnesse prepares His willing troopes, conducted by the choice Of high-borne Leaders sideing in these wars, And fronteth Edward neere to Vermandois. There was the preface of this work, but looke To Crescey, and to Poictiers for the booke. The armies are in sight, the world's in feare, And meditates some fatall alteration; Whilst it sees Fate with two great agents there, Ready to grapple with such preparation, That let one quit the field, you cannot tell To mate the other with a paralell. Much by the Pope was wrought, no lesse was wrought By the Sicilian King, whose skill in starres, And leaves of heaven, did take this lesson out, That France should lose much life blood in these wars; But like to truant boyes, though he entreat, They will not learne their lesson, but be beat. In countenances all the day is spent, And in each others mutuall survey, To take a measure of themselves, but meant To use some other rule, some stricter way, When hands shold censure, if their eyes judg'd true, For this was nothing but an enterview. Romes mediation, and Sicilia's prayer Was cost ill spent; for they themselves will stay Themselves from fight: as you have seene a paire, Who held and sought to, needs will make a fray. If you but lose your hold, and lose no words, They very fairely will put up their swords. Pardon high soules; I know 'twas policy, Not cowardise that made this seeming fault: For France in France will not her fortunes try, The English fewer, thought not fit to assault. The actions like the causes different are, You stay'd in wisdome, and they stay'd in feare. The Kings dislodge: Philip to Paris goes, Edward to Brabant, to confirme his friends: Suffolk is left to counterchek his foes, And Edwards voyage now for England bends, Where he expecteth, till the laurell boughes Shall reach their growth, which must enshade his browes. But Suffolk too adventrous, neere Lile Is taken, while he made himselfe beleeve Fortune was not a she, nor would beguile The trust he had put in her. To conceive That Fortune alway will our suits commence, Is a presumption, not a confidence. The Lord of Rambois doth the Duke surprise In a blinde ambush: a Commander must Vse pretty cheats, darke stratagems devise; If not perfidious, they are not unjust. No matter in thy enemies defeit, If it be open force, or fine deceit. After the high exploits which he had done, After the smooth proceedure of successe, Chance like the Moone eclipsed his honours Sunne, And hid it in a veile of gloominesse. All men have some black bils to pay, and yet He never liv'd, that dyed in fortunes debt. This check did much import Edwards designes; Tis ominous stumbling in our setting forth: It workes upon the wavering Flemmings mindes. Tis hard to trust a mercenary worth. He's moulded new at every alteration; Who dares sell life, dares sell his reputation. Edward is studious to repaire this errour, And with a speedy care prepares a fleet; France hoping our mischance had beene our terrour, At Sluce in Flanders will our navy meet. But that unfortunate disgrace, which wee Received on land, is wash'd away at sea. While all these woodden castles stand together, They seem'd like forrests planted in the seas; And if you wonder how this wood came hither, Thinke, as Amphions musick brought the trees To build his city up, these trees did come Woo'd by the musick of the Fife and Drum. The other fleet, that from the North was led Vnder the fate of Morleys happy hand, Ioyn'd with the King, the French encountered With such a shock, that both fleets staggering stand. So meet the clouds, and the Symplegades Thus joust, and tourney in the Thracian seas. We had the faire advantage of the day, The Sun and winde were seconds in this fight: The Sun did face to face himselfe display, And make them stand like night-birds in the light: The winds of heaven being mixed with our breath, Playd on their faces, and did whisper death. The French with horrour and with wounds pursu'd, Make flight their study, yet they cannot fly. They strike the water like a fowle eneav'd: At once they fear'd, and did not feare to dy. They drowne themselves, so to escape the foe, Th' English were cowards, and durst not doe so. Most of the men are either slaine, or drown'd, Most of the ships in the curl'd waves are whirl'd: You would have thought those vessels had been bound By some new passage to the other world; And that they had discover'd in those seas, A neerer way to the Antipodes. There one upon a mast doth pearching stand, And thinkes to run from death by sitting still: As when some flood comes sweeping on the land, The Peasant turn'd ambitious, climes a hill. But the aspiring of the waves at last, Doth top that hill, and overpearch that mast. There one (poore trust) unto some rope doth trust, Or anchour holds, and will not let it goe. And questions with himselfe, if that he must Or hope for mercy from the sea, or foe. Weary at length, and desperate of either, Lets goe the anchour, and his hope together. Another makes a broken plank his boat, And hath no ores, but those which nature gave him, On mixed blood and water he doth float, But neither blood, nor water now can save him: Yet there was some of his owne naturall blood, Which striv'd to waft him in this crimson flood. Iustly the French on Buchet lay the blame, Who basely loth fit moneys to defray, Refus'd to take soldiers of marke and name, Who conscious of their worth, ask'd greater pay. When covetous Cheifes are sparing of their crowns, Few soldiers will be prodigall of wounds. But he ignoble Generall had mann'd His ships with halfe-made, and inferiour men Who (conscionable things) could not demand More then they knew their meanes could pay agen. How cheaply doe we see some service bought? True: but it is of fooles, whose ware is nought. Rich in the greatest conquest that our seas Could boast before, he leades his men (whom fates Destine for higher actions than these) With a victorious march to Tourney gates. And as the men at armes the town environ, They stood about it like a wall of iron. Let Tourney quake, great Edward's at her gate, And like a meteor menaceth her wals: Tourney may glorie in her better fate, If by the hands of Edward, Tourney fals. For 'tis a comfort by great hands to dy, And thus to fall is next to victory. His Cartill then he did dispatch from Chin To Philip: addes no complement, but this, Plaine Philip: for he thought it was a sinne To call him King of that was none of his. Whatso'er of King, Edward had Philip sent, So much of King, Edward had Philip lent. He shewes that he the fairest wayes had us'd, And softest termes to have his right restor'd; But since those lenitives had been refus'd, The case must be disputed by the sword. It is the method Physick thinks most sure, A desperate griefe must have a desperate cure. And that the French might know his personall worth, He dar'd de Valois to a single fight, And if not that, to draw a hundred forth, That fewer slaughters might decide the right. A good King knowes (cause all depend on him) To lose a subject, is to lose a limb. I dare not question, if a Leader should Be personally seene in such an action; It is enough for me, that Edward would, His precedent is reall satisfaction: A King's a god on earth, and this Ile call Edwards divinity; one die for all. But such defiances are vaine to those, Who rather trust their numbers, than their right: Now army army, all must all oppose: Some coward joyn'd with company, dares fight: This is the ground which he relies upon, Some may have valour there, though he hath none. Here valiant Philip thinkes the lay unjust, As for the chalenge, 'twas beneath his feare: What reason is alledg'd why Philip must Lay downe the stakes for both the gamesters there? At France alone must both their dice be throwne? Philip thinks 'tis unjust: that stake's his owne. Our Edwards propositions thus denyed, Tis Edwards resolution, that the fate And fortunes of both Kingdomes should be tried, Within ten dayes after his letters date: The French know this resolve: 'tis bravely done, To tell thy foman when thou wilt come on. Twas genuine valour in our Grandsires, who Proclaimed when, and what they meant to doe, And scorn'd like theeves to steale upon a foe, A foe unwarned, is unarmed too. By sculking out to beat an enemy, Doth pilfer honour, and steale victory. Good Theodosius did himselfe allot This ten dayes space, to try his enemy, If he would venture on his power, or not Rather embrace and hug his clemency. Pitie doth kisse true valour, it did ne'r Rebate a Cimeter, or blunt a speare. Yet 'twas an act of pure humanity, For in a rigorous strictnesse Edward might In the first ranke marshall extremity, For he already had declar'd his right. And when our rights and wrongs apparant are, Nature's the Herald to denounce the war. And now the enemy is on his way, The French, Navar, the Scotch, and Boheme King, To take this hungry Lion from his prey: Fower Kings but named, might some terrour bring. But titles never were by judgment fear'd: Had all the host been Kings, he had not car'd. The flowers of France were gathered, and set In this one field, to scare, not deck the day: Where his choice flow'rs, the valiant nobles met; And Chevalliers in sight as brave as they Who were perhaps, but as our Tulips are, Vselesse in Physick, though for colours rare. Our English soldiers were as few, as plaine: They're halfe so many, a fourth part so fine: Yet hearts as brave as theirs, twice dyde in graine. With them the Flemming and high Dutch combine. And in our front th' Imperiall Eagle flew, Shaking the plumes that victory did mue. The English long to argue with their foes And make full demonstration of their powers. Heavens doe dispose and shape the hearts of those, Whom it hath markt, and prickt for Conquerours. What though they fewer were? if heaven intends The agents are proportion'd to their ends. High-sp'rited Philip with an equall heat Pants for the combat: reason doth deny: His Councellours advise, his friends entreat, Not to lay all his fortunes on one die. He's an ill husband, and will beg at last, Will venture all's revenues at a cast. Vpon this board they play at little game, Some petty skirmishes; and we are beat: But when rich stakes, and greater wagers came, Philips ill throwing lost what ere was set. As one that hath good luck to play for pins, But let him play for money, never wins. While th' eye of Europe on this action bends, Either with griefe, or with too strong intention, It seemes to water at the sight, and spends Her summe of teares: for if they want prevention, Who'er is dim'd, Europe will want some light, And will prove porblind, if not lose her sight. Europe may feare, these cannot be dismaid, For they have other worke: as when two Champions, who ne'r were taught to be affraid, Are listed in, deaths businesse to doe, The pale ring of spectatours, which are there, Are farre more frighted than the fighters are. The cloud of war was ready to dissolve To showers of blood: the aire affrighted fear'd The blowes it should receive: they all resolve To goe, or send to death: but all is cleard: What was presaged black, proves a faire day, A Ladies breath dispeld the storme away. Sister to Philip, mother to Edwards wife, The Lady Iane de Valois interceeds, A cloystered Nun sets period to the strife, Or else whole troopes had died, but now none bleeds: Troopes of that force, that had they joynd in one, Had throwne a palenesse on the Turkish moone. While they are fixt on their intentions, she Fights with their passions, runs from side to side, And with firme patience, ripe dexterity, Cuts her owne way, and will not be denied. The captive windes thus labour in the ground, To rend that passage that could not be found. Goe blessed Nun, whose tunefull eloquence, And sinewie rhet'rick did winde the state Of the great question then was in suspence: Thou didst in this so supererogate; That if one may anothers merit have, Thy surplusage a world of scolds shall save. Coriolanus armd with fury, dar'd Bid a defiance to ingratefull Rome; And would have humbled her proud hils, nor feard Had the grim father of Romes founder come. His mothers loving prayer make him yeeld, Her armes, not Romes, must make him quit the field. Edward for England hasts, puts out of pay His forreine aids: he findes his treasuries Starv'd by his Officers, since he went away: The Dutch shall not share in his victories: The English only shall partake in glory, None else be quoted in their honourd story. Nor is it wisdome where no treasures are, To hope for succour from a strange supply: Mony's the nerve and ligament of war, It makes them fight, and keepes from mutiny. Leaders are soules, armies the bodies, coine The vitall spirits that doe both combine. This truce was midwife to that high dislike Louys of Bavier tooke, who now pretends Edward had wrongd him, who a truce did strike, And not let him be privy to his ends. The man that from thy friendship would be gone, Can an occasion finde where thou leftst none. But fare him well: Louys is far from France, Edward a new confederate hath found, Who can more powerfully his case advance, Monfort in France can France more deeply wound. Louys at every instant cannot come, Monfort's in distance, and he can strike home. Now war doth quit her prison, and rejoice To try in Britaine her uncertaine chance. Edward for Monfort stands, Philip for Blois, Who both plead right in that inheritance: Weapons are drawne on both sides to cut out Their rights, but are put up before they fought. For now two Cardinals (a Nun before) Make a faire truce, and are the shields of France, As Fabius of Rome: their words fence more Than armes; but when the English next advance, And march to Crescey, then the French shall know Their Church hath not a guard for such a blow. Impatient Mars once more to prison must, And fast from blood; nor dare once dreame of fight, Their tooles of death for want of use shall rust, Whilst plowmen stewd in sweat make theirs looke bright Tis irons proper use, for which twas found, Not to carve up a Christian, but the ground. This pause doth not determine, but defer, And make more worke for wounds, when next they fought: This rest doth to another day refer. This fire is but smothered, not put out. Truce is the cour-few bell, whose humming chime Rakes up wars embers for some other time. Now though their helmets gather rust, and are The shops where spiders weave their bowels forth; Yet let not those brave heads, which did them weare, In rusty idlenesse entomb their worth. The spirits are extinct, and valour dies, Without their soveraigne diet, exercise. Which mov'd our second Arthur to erect A table, lest their magnanimity Should languish in dull coldnesse, and neglect Of practising their armes, and Chevalry. For exercise and emulation are The parents that beget children for war. Fam'd Arthur worthy of best pens, but that Truth is so far before 'tis out of sight. Thy acts are made discourse for those that chat Of Hamptons cut-throat, or the Red-rose Knight: Yet there is truth enough in thy faire story, Without false Legends to enshrine thy glory. Some Monkish pen hath given thy fame more blowes, Than all the Saxons could thy body lend: The hand a sacrifice to Vulcan owes, That kild the truth by forgeries it pend. When truth and falshood enterlaced ly, All are thought falshoods by posterity. And to invite great men from forreine parts (Guests worthy of this table) he did ad Rich salaries to sublimate their hearts For high designes: some guerdon must be had To raise a great, and a dejected soule: Virtue steeres bravely where there's such a pole. Antiquity the Arts so flourishing saw, Cheerd by their Patrons sweet and temperate aire: Twas hope of meed that made Apelles draw Such an unvalued peece of Philips heire: And well he might: rewards not only can Draw such a picture, but make such a man. Philip well knowing this association Was of high consequence, and great import, A table did erect in imitation, Where Almaines and Italians should resort. He writ by Edwards copy: in all Schooles Examples may instruct as well as rules. Yet in the reigne of this first sonne of Mars, All is not sternely ruggged; some delights, Sweet amorous sports to sweeten tarter wars, And then a dance began the Garter Knights. They swell with love, that are with valour fild, And Venus doves may in a headpeece build. As Sarums beauteous Countesse in a dance Her loosned garter unawares let fall, Renowned Edward tooke it up by chance, Which gave that order first originall. Thus saying to the wondring standers by, There shall be honour to this silken tie. From that light act this Order to begin, May seeme derogatory from its worth: And yet small things have directories been Actions of veneration to bring forth. That accident might the originall prove: Nobility lies couching under love. At least the mott retorted on the Queene, And smiling Courtiers might from hence proceed. Something like that of Philips, having seene The regiment of lovers that lay dead At Cheronea. May destruction fall On them, who these thinke any ill at all. Some the beginning from first Richard bring, (Counting too meanly of this pedegree) When he at Acon tied a leather string About his soldiers legs, whose memory Might stir their valour up. But choose you whether You'll Edwards silke prefer, or Richards leather. But they take not a scruple of delight, More than's by nature given to relish paine At once, you're welcome pleasure, and good night, Before tis setled, tis expeld againe. As dogs of Nilus drinke, a snatch, and gone; Sweets must be tasted, and not glutted on. By this time France is rank, her veines are full And ripe to be let blood; deaths instruments Are now keene edged, which before were dull, And fit to execute the minds intents. The furies rowsed from their loathed shelves, For former fastings, now may feast themselves. This truce was not to famish them, but get Them better stomachs when they next shall feed; The fight, and not the war was ended yet, War by peace only is determined. Truce but suspends a war, makes it not cease: For there's no medium between war and peace. Th' act of hostility, and the exercise Of war hath stoppage, but the war is still: As when victorious sleep doth win my eyes, And captivate my senses; yet none will Say I have lost my sense: thus truces are But the mere sleepes, and holydayes of war. The sword, the shield, the battaile axe, the speare, Are taken from the well stor'd armory, And that which justly shall beget most feare, The well experienc'd English archery, Who knew to conquer. Parthia cann't shew Such high rais'd Trophies as our English bow. Tall ships are rigg'd, and with provision stord, Stay but a while, till a faire winde shall rise: Yong Iason had nor such with him aboard, When bound to Colchos for the golden prize. The merry ships as they were launching forth, Did seeme to dance to have in them such worth The sailes as if with child, grew big with wind, And long to have flowne ore the briny ford: The rising waves for feare, themselves declind, Supposing they were Neptunes were aboard: Or else for feare Neptune kept down the maine, Lest seeing them, it would have chang'd the reigne. The vessels are unlading of their fraight, Richer than ever crost the seas before; The earth with longing did appeare to wait, As proud to have their footsteps on the shore. But the dipleased sea growne angry now, Vext for this losse, fretted her wrinckled brow. But if wise nature had informd the earth, That all her Vert should into Gules be turnd, Or of that blood she should teeme such a birth As she had of the Giants, she had mournd, Or else sunck downe under the trembling flood, Then had they fought in a red sea of blood. None knew to what his purposes did lead, Nor how he aimed: his councels he did close Vnder the seale of silence, all were freed From possibility to tell his foes. Counsels should ly so deep, none might them sound, This god the Romans buried in the ground. Some thirty thousand foot great Edward led, With these were joynd twenty five hundred horse. The French the fields with five such numbers spred; Yet heated by their wrongs, he beards their force. Not Clements mediation can asswage The just incensed flame of Edwards rage. Their hosts before twice did their weapons shake, Twice did their hosts returne without a stroke, They truce at Tourney, and at Malstroict make, A truce twice made, the French as often broke. The unmanly forfeit of fidelity Is worst eclipse in sphere of majesty. The truce thus broke, they for themselves pretend The other guilty of this fraction, They can no longer hold; their hands did bend Vnto this businesse of destruction, And worke of ruine: and conclude it fit To prove the will which destiny had writ. Questionlesse Philip brake it, for he spils Bacons and Clissons blood in Normandy: Nor can one place confine his rage, he kils Edwards approved friends in Picardy. Our friends are parts make us entirely one, What's left of us is lame, when they are gone. Man, as he's man, to sheild from injury, Man by that bare relation's bound to doe: But if they be our friends, that double ty Makes valour justice, and one virtue two. Woods protect beasts, and altars slaves defend, A friend for sanctuary flyes to his friend. But what's the fault that Philip here pretends? A sinne drawne from the womb; they English were. But more: these worthies all were Edwards friends. O that's a mortall sinne France cannot spare. Yet since they crowned with these titles dy, It is their honour, not their miscry. But that which most agreeved Edward strooke, And to his honour seem'd the greatest staine, Philip too hautily that homage tooke, Which Edward did to him for Aquitaine. When you depresse great spirits that aspire, You throw down bals to make them rise the higher Must active Edward homage to him sweare, Whom Edward thinkes of him should hold in fee? Philip might well that ceremonie spare, Nor brave him with that lower qualitie, Who was his equall, and should shake his throne, And him out of it, for this act alone. It is a trespasse against martiall right, To take up wrongs on trust, and not repay: When bearing old ones new ones do invite, There Clement cannot Edwards fervour stay, Since he is justly fir'd, lesse shall be done Now by a Pope, than had been by a Nun. His fleet sets down his men in Normandy, And then is left to th' faith of Huntingdon. In this faire heaven of magnanimity, The Prince the rising starre of honour shon, Fixt here so soone by's fathers hand, who meant He there should fall, or guild that firmament. In Ianuary, and about this time The forward trees did buds and blossomes bring, The winter did anticipate the prime, May I not think, that this prodigious spring Presag'd this sprig of fame so soone should sprout, And shoot the buds of hopefull actions out? When higher acts must presently be done, And works of wonder; those whom heaven doth cast For actors, with great forwardnesse come on, And are made fit with a miraculous haste. They're perfected by instants, not degrees: At once they blossome like the Mulbery trees. March on; and now at Caranton they are, Great Clissons hands are naild upon her gates: This act shall make her feele th' extreme of war, And wronged Clissons hands shall spin her fates. Like a Petar they make her gates to fly, And ope a passage to their misery. For Caranton can now no longer hold, (For guilt is fearfull) and the English are Like heards of wolves amidst a fleecy fold, Wrong'd favours turn'd to fury none will spare. From for drams of Clissons blood whole pounds are shed. And hundreds are attonement for his head. The wals that would have guarded them, shall burne, And cause they shar'd in guilt, be razed downe: Edward the buildings doth to atomes turne, As if he would annihilate the towne. For that his corps they of its rites beguile: The towne in flames is Clissons funerall pile. After some warmer bickerings they win The populous towne of Caen in Normandy: Then Falaise, Lyseaux, Houfleur they take in, Who yeeld their fortunes which they durst not try. If Caen be cast, whose pleas more urging are, These dare not bring their cases to the bar. Swords sweating drops of blood, do sacrifice To Edwards slaughterd friends: where ere they came, Vindictive fires whole villages surprize, And in a lightning round make such a flame, That if the fire under the Moone were spent, There were supplies for that fourth element. With these two ushers having cut his way, (Which could have cut one through the Alpes) hee spred His force i'th' Ile of France; for yet no stay Had shewd it selfe, no foe had made a head. Edward's neere Paris now; and in the eye Of France will wrastle for the mastery. Philip awaked had purveied together A goodly power, which he to Meulan led; Edward retires upon his comming thither, And France imagines that our Edward fled. But twas not Meulan where they should debate, Twas printed Crescey in the map of fate. And twas high time to bid the English stand, But yet they had not clos'd with them in fight. They tumble downe the bridges, and command Th' impetuous streames to countercheck their might. Edward must combat, if he will passe ore, Now against water, as with fire before. But while the English are in search to finde Where it is fordable, and how they might Gaine to the other side, the French divin'd By weake conjectures, that this stay was flight. Thus doe we build assurance on a wave, And easily beleeve what we would have. Weake man (the well stor'd shop of vanities) (Dreame of a shade, and shadow of a dreame) Erects presumptions on uncertainties, And is in feares, and hopes fondly extreme. Thoughts aiery castles in a breath doe fall, And hopes which highest fly, flag first of all. Edward in them will nourish this conceit, That he is still afraid, to make them dare Come neerer danger, nor will he deny't They should interpret that this stay was feare: But spight of comments, when he meets them next, They'll finde their glosse was nothing to his text. The streame no longer can their journey bound, Nor with his winding armes the passage keepe On Blanchtaque upon Some the English found A ford which nature had not made so deepe: For nature durst not be rebellious To stay, whom heaven would have victorious. Where was this ford before? never before This maiden ford had an impression in it: Never till now was there a passage ore: Till now no traveller could ever win it To let him passe: as if this loving shelfe For this great favour had reser'vd it selfe. A simple peasant did the way direct, Who to the English then a prisoner was: A jumping hind did once the ford detect, Where Clovis might Viennas river passe. Nature hath made nothing so base, but can Read some instruction to the wisest man. Then Edward bravely enterd on the ford, (Like to great Philips greater sonne, when he Fought against Porus) with this moving word, He that doth love me, let him follow me: It was a word so forcive, that it might Make valour wonders doe, and basenesse fight. Philip six thousand foot, a thousand horse, Sends to the ford whom Godmar led a long: To lay a rub before the English course: But opposition maketh strength more strong. For virtue gathers heat by having foes; Valour is chil'd and numb'd when none oppose. As when the sea hath artificiall bounds, And dammes have laid command upon the waves, Not rebell-like to overrun the grounds; More madded with these stops, it wildly raves. For valour's of that one-ey'd Captaines minde, Twill make a passage where it cannot finde. Fury is not by full resistance tamde, Voiding must ward it: he is mad will stay, A Beare or Bull broke loose: fury enflamd Is violent in all that's in its way. What stands before is offered to the eye In the true nature of an enemy. And now St. George. The French are mowed down Like men ripe for the sword: the English won The quitted bank; Godmar is overthrown, And when no hands to fight, hath feet to run: And lest their army should too great be thought, Leads back two thousand fewer then he brought. The losse was not so great as the disgrace, For Godmar startled with our resolution, His soldiers saw cold feare writ in his face, And in those letters read their owne confusion. Apish of what they saw their Captaine doe, He was affraid, and so will they be too. They bring their King nothing but feare, and shame, They seeme like sp'rits which haunt a charnell house, They were so pale: so red, as if they came From Tyrian dyfat, or a Greeke carouse. Who is't can blazon both the colours there? Purpled at once with shame, candied with feare. Philip tooke fire, strooke with this hard event, (And yet his heat sufficient to give fire) His violent intentions are bent Almost to breaking; and his wilde desire Cals for his danger, as one meant to fight To whip himselfe for his owne oversight. Anger's the mother of a furious haste, Haste the stepmother of the best designes: Things that are longest ripening, longest last, A sudden elevation soone declines. Precipitate resolves abortive come, Like a rude embryon from miscarying womb. Counsell advis'd, that his distouted men Should have some pause to breath, and rectifie Their startled spirits, then fall on agen. But he blowne up with hope of victory, Flyes to the English army, whence he thought Conquest to fetch, but he it thither brought. Calme Edward is encamp'd at Crescey now, Which in his mothers right was Edwards owne: Crescey is famed for that overthrow, Where horrour in the deepest die was showne. To be in view of that which is ones right, Would make a heart far lesse than Edwards fight. Well temper'd Edward having sent by prayer His hope to heaven, begins to draw the fashion His army now should go in, with such faire Assurednesse, and freedome from all passion, That he had pos'd a Stoick to see there So great a danger with so small a feare. In three battalias the King drew out His men, by valiant Commanders led: Wales her yong Lion in the vangard fought, Which like a herse in forme was ordered. It were enough to make a coward fly, To see this emblem of mortality. With him was Harcourt, Warwick, and La Ware, Beaucham, and Bourchier, worthies who knew well The use of hand and head: the next troopes are Led by Northampton, Suffolk, Arundel, Chiefes who like soules could the dull spirits stir, In the chill heart of coldest follower. The third batalia King Edward led, His soldiers might under his conduct be Proud, and secure: so Mars stood in the head Of his robustious Thracian company. The three battalias seem'd as they did stand, The three-fork'd thunder in Ioves flaming hand. The van the Prince of hope and honour led. To give first welcome to the enemy. The body of the strength is managed By Suffolk active soule of Chevalry. Edward to moderate brings up the reere, And like a Pilot stands behinde to steere. The English army is clos'd up behinde, And barricado'd that they cannot flie. Their horses tooke away, put them in minde, That they were there to conquer, or to die. Tis policy to bar the meanes of flight, Necessity will make a coward fight. Couragious Edward spurs their valour on, And cheeres his sprightfull soldiers: where he came, His breath did kindle valour where was none, And where it found a spark, it made a flame. Armies of fearfull Harts will scorne to yeeld, If Lions be their Captaines in the field. Through all the army this tenth worthy rid, With a white rod in his victorious hand; As if to chastise fortune if she did But dare his uncontrol'd designes withstand. Though fooles and cowards at the name doe quake, The wise and valiant their fortune make. The King (as strength joyned with wisdome should) Set targets in the front, to save his men From Genoan crosbowes; so wise Rome of old Gave crownes to them that sav'd a citisen. Offensive rashnesse she did not commend: Tis the first act valour to defend. Which made the old King of Bohemia say, The English marshalling speakes this intent, Either to lose their lives, or win the day: To get a Trophy, or a monument. A soldier hath two aimes; to win, or dy: A coward two, quickly to win, or fly. Old age had thrown a darknesse on his eyes, He saw not objects in a distance were: He sees not how our English army lies, Yet he did farther see, though not so far. He could not reach the army with his sight, And yet he saw the issue of the fight. Our army by the French was mastered In number, in advantage, and in show. Yet all with Edwards right were ballanced. Furious D' Alanson in the front must goe To keepe with's fire: had he been in the rere, That had beene in the van, though he not there. Then Savois Earle to make the conquest full, Brings in a thousand to the enemy, To share in his hop'd fortunes, and to pull A pinion from the wing of victory: But Savoy here his debt to nature payes, And plucketh Cypresse for triumphant Bayes. Philip his bloody banner did erect, On which they lay much faith, as faln from hev'n: And that the French like rigour might expect From a just fury, Edward to be even, Advanc'd his Dragon Gules, to let them know, They must have none that will no mercy show. Black was the day: the Chaos was thus black Before twas said, let there be light; the clouds Opend their watry treasures, which did crack They were so full, all is in sable shrouds: The symptomes of true griefe were in the sphere, As if it meant to be chiefe mourner here. The Sun at first halfe scared with the sight, Behind the Moone with halfe his body lies: So soone as he was quitted of this fright, He shot his beames full on the Frenchmens eyes, And 'gainst them let his rayes like arrowes fly, As if he sided with our archery. Then on a cloud an arch triumphall drew, And lookt upon that watry looking-glasse, That he himselfe might by reflexion view, Whether his late eclipse had chang'd his face: Or else it was to let the English know How much they were indebted to the bow. The lightning cuts the aire with flaming wing, Willing to aid the Sun in that dark day: And heavens great shot did in the welkin ring, And with loud bellowings usher the fray, As if for those great Lords which there should fall, Heaven ow'd a volly to the funerall. Shoales of ill-boding ravens (as if the sky Had not beene dark enough) a shadow made Dark as the clouds; that though the glorious eye Of heaven had shin'd they had beene in the shade. Fowles joyntly met to feast upon the dead, The guests were tombes where men were buried. Death in this gloominesse thus shadow'd out, Presag'd an army should be overthrowne, Twas Bohems augury before they fought: He saw the death of others, not his owne. He stood too neere himselfe: some eyes command The objects distance, see not what's at hand. The pikes are order'd, ensignes are displayd, And menace brave extremity; the light Of glittring helmes, and waving streames made A day seem cleere which before seemed night: Pale feare had amorous lookes, and all the while Terrour lookt lovely, and death seem'd to smile. The shafts headed with death, and wing'd with speed, Now to the arched engine they apply, Which as if hungry on mans flesh to feed, With greedy certainty appear'd to fly. Their bowes with such a certainty they drew, As Phœbus did when he the Python slew. We to the greygoose wing more conquests ow, Than to the Monks invention; for then We cull'd out mighty armes to draw the bow, Striplings oft serve us now, then only men. For these hot engines equall mischiefe can, Discharged by a boy, or by a man. Bullets, because they undiscerned fly, Worke lesse effects of feare: but dangers seen, If they cannot be fenc'd, more terrifie; At startled sense, reason hath startled been; Amaz'd to have so many shafts in sight, In hope to ward them they forget to fight. A well selected archer can let fly Thrice, for one shot of the best musketeere: And barbed arrowes gall more eagerly, Where they once light, they second fresh wounds there; And mad the horse, who will not forward stur, More sensible of them, than of the spur. Who madded as they backward fly, doe fall Foule on their owne, and doe their service there, Whilst their owne horses their owne quarters maull, They both themselves and enemy must feare. Thus broke, with an unwilling courtesie, They ope a passage to the enemy. The musketeers discharge but in one rank At once, but whole squadrons of archers may: These wound at randome, they but at point blank; And when both sides are now engag'd in fray At push of pike; behinde the armed foot, Though muskets cannot, yet the bows may shoot. At the fam'd battaile of Lepanto, when Valiant yong Austria was Admirall. The Turkish archery did slay more men, Than by our peeces of all sorts did fall. And the white faith of history cann't show That ere the musket yet could beat the bow. The Genoan bowes to make the French horse way In the first point are ranged: but the showres Auxiliary heav'n distill'd that day, Dissolve the Genoan strings, but hurt not ours. Small things work much where victory is due, And only hurt your foe, though might hurt you. Now since their bowes unserviceable be, The King commanded Alanson to rent And beat them from the point: thus oft we see Actions condemn'd for some ill accident Which may miscarry, when tis not the crime Of those that did attempt them, but the time. Meane men are often in small faults impeacht, Greatnesse above the clouds so high is shrin'd, It cannot by Ioves greatest shot be reacht, And laughs at the low vollies of the wind: Wolfebane 'mongst roses leaves its deadly sent, Faults among great men finde no punishment, Good discipline had set them in the front, As first to taste the danger, and to beare The weighty pressure of the ensuing brunt: Wise policy would still have kept them there, I'th' face of horrour, for no cause but that, To be the buts which we might levell at. But Alanson pretending that their course, Was hindred by them, cryes, on, on, my friends, Beare downe this baser Genowaies with your horse, And on their bellies raise your higher ends. Thy rashnesse, Alanson, will blast thy name, And on their ruines thou shalt build thy shame, Our English of their strings more care did take, Whose winged pursuivants deaths message beare, Some through loves seat, the liver, passage make, As if our Archers had beene Cupids there: Some strike lifes seat, the heart, so that you can Scarce tell, if death did shoot them or a man. As when the colder region of the aire Moulds raine to haile-shot, the relenting tree Of the plump God, lusty before, and faire, Loseth her rubies with heavens battery. Thus fell the foe; for shoot though in the dark, Tis hard to misse, when the whole field's a mark. The Genovaes thus broken, and disgrac'd, Divert their anger, and their choler bend Against the French; thus vext, they're soone displac'd: Dishonour had untaught them to defend. They cann't prevaile, who are at once to fight With th' English arrowes, and the French despight. And lest this rupture should be clos'd agen, And cemented with order, and with care: The English wedg'd together, dashing in, Did rive these breaches greater then they were. Small cracks are previous to the greatest rents: Meane things dispose to highest consequents. The Genoan tempest thus dispell'd, their force Divided wins no feare; a mighty flood Cut in small rils, is weakned in his course, And parted strength is easily withstood. Divide, and then you conquer: for though none Can breake a sheafe of darts, he may breake one. Disorder's next to ruine, and destroyes The essence of creatures, order did create. Then by the rule of contrarieties, Tis a disorder doth annihilate, By this ill shaped enemy do fall, Both bodies politick and naturall. Continued or collected bodyes are Weakned by their disunion; but doe Get strength by un'ty; beames reflex'd are far More hot, because they are united: so We see in bodies livened by a soule, The union of the parts conserves the whole. Divisions ruine Realmes: the Monarchies Of Mars his Rome, and Macedon thus fall: Christendomes whip that now doth tyrannize, Shall thus returne to her originall. Factions those commas are, that bring the state Of Kingdomes to their period, and to fate. The hot Count Alanson with fiery horse Scoures ore the plaines with an impetuousnesse, Which eas'ly made it a short winded course: As it was said of great Themistocles: His flame was soone extinguish'd, and did draw To a too sudden end, like fire in straw. The Generous mettal'd courser (as if we Had beene too slow on foot) is taught to fight: We borrow speed to meet our enemy, And fly to our revenge: and to doe right Vnto the active French; old Thessaly Won not more Garlands than her Chevalry. Armies (if we Iphicrates will heare) Are of themselves dull bodies, nor can weeld Their Sullen weights, unlesse the horse be there, Which are the feet: indeed the horse at field Are best in actions of celerity, In expeditions, and discovery. But horse 'gainst resolute foot but little win: The mounting is more firme, the aime's more sure: For footmen haue their moving from within, They from their horse: yet horse are more secure In flight, and have (as Xenophon did say) But the advantage when they run away. Alanson now the causey hath transpast, Paved with Genoan bodies: with him post Sauoy and Lorraine, not with speed, but haste; As if all had beene lost, if they not lost. But 'twas ill weather they did journey in: A showre of steele did wet them through the skin. At the first charge they with such furie went, As if they were their owne artillery: Their second charge wants fire, as if they meant To prove the censure of antiquity; That at the first they could out-act a man, But at the next doe lesse than women can. Though the first troopes that came did cut, and draw Danger so like it selfe, with shape so fit, With looke so grim, that he who never saw Danger before, would guesse that that were it: Yet they want Edwards hand; for they did but Cut out their danger, he their ruine cut. He led a regiment of well-pickt forces, Who tilting through their quarters, rend their way: With crosbowes he securely flank'd his horses, That shafts and lances might together play. Shafts, as if carri'd, lend a certaine blow, Speares, as if shot, did suddenly do so. They're now at rugg'd embraces with the foe, And bring death sooner by their being there: Tis the best act of love that hate can doe, By hastning death to give lesse time to feare. He that tooke feare to halves, was there a saver, Death at once had, and lookt for is a favour. The sprightly Count is quickly out of breath, Like to heavens lightning, as soone out, as seene, A gallant flash before the night of death; Those edges soonest turne, that are most keene. A sober moderation stands sure, No violent extremities endure. Those motions continue, that doe goe Natures soft pace: she doth her progresse hold With a firm'd softnesse: like those dames that doe Walk lively, when the Church book stiles them old: Yet natures selfe redoubling her haste, Sayes her owne motions have not long to last. As soone as banks were set to bound the course Of this fierce eddy, Alanson's engaged Within the lists of death; the galled horse (Impatient patients of their wounds) enraged, Dismount their riders, vext, that they did beare Men, that did spur them to those dangers there. Valour on either side was so sincere, That it refus'd no test, and fear'd no touch: Nor in the weight was any difference there, Both to a scruple equally as much. The dayes and nights were never poiz'd more even, By the impartiall ballances of heaven. Danger growne proud, did like an Eagle scorne To stoope at flyes, or on small quarries light: The weight of France ambitiously was borne On Edward: English against Philip fight. The Tamarisk's secur'd by growing under, They're Pine's &amp; Cedars that are cuft with thunder. It is wars cruell policy to play High at the head: armies are pulled downe Best by the poule: when Kings lives waft away In a Red Sea; the soldiers vent their owne Through their wide wounds. In these great engines Kings Doe stand at once, both for the wheeles and springs. Now carefull Philip his battalia brings To disengage his cosen: and foresight And providence in Kings doe make them Kings: Kingdomes are Chaoses without their light. And in Niles mystick characters, the eye More than the scepter noted majesty. Suffolk as wary on his battaile drew, To aid his Prince, and check the King of France: While rusty horrour through the armies flew, And dealt his dole of death: indiff'rent chance Durst not yet choose the side on which to be, And no lesse wavering was victory. Reason it selfe did think it fit to leave them To their wilde passions, and let fury guide: Now choler of their reason doth bereave them: If fury be at home, reason's deni'd. Madnesse and anger differ but in this, This is short madnesse, that long anger is. The swords forgat to glister any more, As loth to lend their light to that dark shade: They're double dyde in a deep graine of gore, You'ld think they had so many Comets made: So many by their fatall seisures di'd, That Atropos might lay her knife aside. The pondrous mace wheeling about, did fall Like ruine on their heads: there a scull flyes New rob'd of braines: they did so strongly maull, As if a single stroke should pulverize. If any death did aske more blowes then one, The act were sullied, and the lustre gone. Of old the Tyrian Dyers thus did slay The Purple fishes: if more strokes than one Were us'd in killing them, by very stay The blood converted to corruption. So dropt the French; as if 'twere meant thereby, They should a purple death like Purples die. The artificiall wood of speares was wet With yet warme blood; and trembling in the winde, Did rattle like the thornes which nature set On the rough hyde of an arm'd Porcupine: Or looked like the trees which dropped gore, Pluckt from the tomb of slaughter'd Polydore. Here a hand sever'd, there an eare was cropt; Here a chap falne, and there an eye put out; Here was an arme lopt off, there a nose dropt; Here halfe a man, and there a lesse peece fought. Like to dismembred statues they did stand, Which had been mangled by times iron hand. There one (as if unwilling should be spent Cost to make Marble seeme to live) doth meane To be himselfe a cheaper monument, Whilst slaine, he still upon his sword doth leane. And for the service he did there that day, Himselfe stood there as his owne statua. Here one, all of whose selfe was as one wound, (Oftner transfixt than mighty Scævas shield) Sometimes himselfe, sometimes he beats the ground, Or clings so fast, as if he'de win the field. So many wayes to death, yet doth not die, The soule uncertaine which way it should flie. There two united gores doe make one flood, Wherein the duellers do saile to death: Thus Elephants and Dragons mix their blood When both do conquer, and both lose their breath. Their angry bloods did in two chanels run, But friendly now in death flow but in one. King Edward like a cloud hung on a hill, (As Africks Captaine said of Fabius) Marking those gamesters, ready to distill When need should bid him be propitious: And whilst he wisely watched for their sakes, Not only view'd the sport, but kept the stakes. Hence with a setled spirit he survai'd His troopes of lively combatants, (for he Was spirit in this sphere, and if it stayd, Could give it motion, and activity: Nay, if he pleas'd to take that resolution, Give it the period, and last revolution.) As an old Eagle pearched on a tree, (After the Sunne hath ratified her brood By their unwavering eyes) is proud to see Her royall birds embrue themselves in blood. So stood the King, whose heart within him glowes To see his Eaglet flesht upon his foes. But as Ioves trees, that crowne proud Idas brow, Stoope at stiffe Eols oft repeated rore, And many drops can eat a Marble through: So numbers iterated beare valour ore. What? can a faintnesse fall on such? it can: Edward may faint, though he be more than man. Nor the intelligence that moves the sphere, Nor sphere it selfe doth any faintnesse prove; Because there is no contranitence there: Nat'rals moved nat'rally may ever move. If to the center were an immense space, A stone for ever could maintaine the race. But whilst our soules have union with clay, Our limbes in upper motions are prest By their owne struggling weight another way. Exhausted spirits bid our motions rest. No mortall's indefatigable: then Had they not fainted, who had thought them men? Now as the English hover on the brink, Of ruine, ready now to make a fraight For gristly Charons leaking boat, and sink Vnder the pressure of their numerous weight. Vnto the King regardfull Suffolk sent: He knows to win, that knows how to prevent. The messenger returnes; his answer this: While the Prince lives, his highnesse will not care, Nor think of aid: he saith the day is his, As lawfull as his birthright: nor will share In his unrivall'd fame; the field must be Either his grave, or stage of victorie. And though he were dismist without a man, Yet with a nobler present; for he brought Accesse of courage, which all numbers can Out poise; for they are uneffectuall thought. And some new spirit did upon them fall, Breath'd from the check of such a Generall. He was not cruell in this act; his sonne Now for his honour fought: and in this strife Aid had tooke from't: therefore the King sends none, To shew he valu'd honour above life. To be indulgent to his life, had beene To kill his honour, and the greater sin. What distance is in man? some are so much Beneath a man, that they are scarse above The worst of beasts: this message cannot touch This man of men, nor his fixt spirit move. But should you it unto a coward tell, It had been deaths stroke, and the passing bell. But 'twas to Edward, and this Edward could As well put off himselfe, as put on feare: It were a sinne to worth, if any should Not think him dreadlesse, and undanted there: For he was heire apparant to the state, And feare had prov'd him illegitimate. Looke, as the earth foundation of all Our staring buildings, yet it selfe hath none; But its owne selfe secures it selfe from fall; And hath no buttresses to leane upon. For whilst grave bodies to the center run, They hug that point, and poise themselves thereon. Thus an Heroick soule lodg'd in a brest, In which are center'd all the lines of worth, Closely compacted on it selfe doth rest, And for its selfe its owne supplies brings forth. Edwards owne worth, if no supports come on, Is its owne base to stay it selfe upon. As when the fire winks with a sulphrie blew, When nipping winter doth astringe the mould In her strait bands; degrees of heat accrew From the circumstant and beleagring cold: The heat contracted burnes more fervently, Hugg'd in th'embraces of its enemy. And as the middle region of the aire, (The seat of chilnesse) hath the cold made great, Being besieged by the other paire, Which keepe the cold penn'd inward with their heat, Which would be weakned by diffusion: so Valour hath its intension from the foe. Hope in great actions is too weak a hold, And yeelds her enterteiner to his foe: When churlish winds with testy Neptune scold, We cut the cables, and let anchours goe. Then hope to win when hope of aid is gone, The way to safety is to looke for none. Now to themselves left, for themselves to try, They wrought out the advantage with the sword: They studied to be knowne to victory, And fought as fresh, as if they ne'r had stird: You might have thought that in this field, the ground For the perpetuall motion had been found. If we had any cowards in the field, They purge their aguish passion, at the sight To see their Prince menace his flaming sheild Like to the Sun; and speare, like Comet light. Where shadowes terminate, light issues in: Tis first to dare to fight, tis next to win. But if there were among our English host, Within the colder region of whose blood There dwelt perpetuall ice, and shiv'ring frost, Which could not be dissolv'd: they did this good; For every English that did basely die, Bequeath'd his foe his feare for legacy. The game of death was but a jest before, Turn'd earnest now: before they did but try To use their weapons; there they did no more But meditate, here practise how to die. And if sterne Mars had left his sanguine throne, Here he had met more Diomeds than one. Mortality till now had but defraid Some trifling reck'nings on deaths bloody score, Some items not worth counting; now death's payd Whole summes: and Charons boat which leakt before, Had sunk right downe, had not his Stygian flood Been made more saileable, thickned with blood. Armour, as if 'twere sensible of smart, Fals to the ground: his flesh who did it beare, Is the best coat of proofe to guard his heart, And their owne armes are the best targets there: Weapons are dull'd but stomachs keener are, And hearts are better pointed then they were. In Africk, neere heavens porter Atlas side, A Lionesse beseig'd by men and hounds, There makes a breach where it is most denide, As free from hope of life, as feare of wounds, Led by despaire, she scoures about the plaine, Thirsty of blood as Africa of raine. So march'd the Prince with his black regiment, (Assisted by the armes of valiant Lords) And topt the gawdy Poppies as they went, And struck such terrour, that before the swords Did seize, the French stood trembling: thus an oke Shakes with the winde ushers the thunderstroke. For they like thunder shot their fury through Where solidnesse did most resistance make; And brake in peeces what they could not bow; Whereon they stand, and thence advanced take Their stately flight: on humbled backs we rise, And on the wings of ruine, conquest flies. Thus Rome in a sedition was tooke When Arnulph came their mutinies to quell; His soldiers shoutings such amazement strooke, That from the wall the startled Romans fell: Their heapes were scaling ladders, and their fall Made him the staires on which he clim'd the wall. And still the French are hard at work about The dreames their weening phantasies did make; But finde the metall that they should beat out So tough, it would not an impression take. For conquests have too much realitie To be the works of the mere phantasie. The Boheme King in head of all his men, Encounters with destruction, and dares Death to a duell, which did meet him then, And with deepe cuts cancell his date of yeeres: Disarm'd him not, he still his weapon held, As if his ghost should fight when he was kild. Twas thy desire, brave Prince, thou shouldst be set To combat one might parallell a King: Edward's the match by whom thou shalt be met: Bohemias Winter fought with Englands Spring: And there thou stoop'st under his high command: Death durst not kill thee but with Edwards hand. There lay the trophie of our Chevalry Plum'd of his Ostridge feathers; which the Prince Tooke as the ensigne of his victory, Which he did after weare; and ever since The Prince of Wales doth that atcheivement beare, Which Edward first did win by conquest there. But did no bearded meteors appeare, Which Fate sets up at Princes funerals, To light them to the other world? for there Another King, Majorcas Soveraigne fals. One King's too much: but there two Kings must dy, And leave two crownes to crowne one victory. And here Alanson had his glorious light Put out, being hurri'd with too furious haste; Which longer would have flam'd, if carried right With moderation; thus a light will last, If it be gently carried about, Run with it hastily, it will go out. Kings, upon whom many depend, have us'd T'have danger at a distance, nor at all Tread within reach: the Theban Chiefe accus'd Himselfe for being neere an arrowes fall. For Kings are those cheife stones which arches knit, If one be dislocated, all will flit. A loyall subject hath nor life nor breath But what's infus'd, and breathed from the Prince. Who if he rashly shall encounter death, Stifles too cruelly his influence. And tis a Problem whether thus to dy, Or greater rashnesse be, or cruelty. Leaders without disgrace have sometime fled: He that did fly this day, may next day fight: Great Amurath had not beene vanquished, Had not Huniades been sav'd by flight. Where life more than our death availes the State, Valour by flight may looke for better fate. Thus Bohemes sonne, since hope had not the face, To promise life, or conquest by his stay: Conceiv'd it rather wisdome, than disgrace, To live by flight; when 'twas the only way: And 'twas enacted he should be preserv'd, For heav'n the Empire had for him reserv'd. But otherwise a Leader must not move, But cope with danger: here a Captaines flight Reads basenesse to his men, and coward love Of an ignoble life; in such a fight A valiant Diomed will rather dy, And scorne to stir though Nestor bids him fly. Twice was the King of France beat off his horse, By Henault mounted up as oft did rise: And acted to the height of single force, He did so nobly fight, so well advise, He seem'd his armies hand, and armies head: He fought like Scæva, and like Cæsar led. The King this act to Henault ow'd alone, Who was his prisoner; and late did fly From Edwards service; as if he had gone To act this scene of strength and piety. For Fate in Adamant did this engrave, That he should leave a King, a King to save. The valiant King still wrastles with his fate, As if he would untwist what that had weav'd; Deeming the web of fate had beene like that, With which the Grecian Dame her loves deceiv'd: Flesh cannot breake the threds the fates have spun, Like Narses web, theirs cannot be undone. The blood which streamed from his neck and thigh, (Imprinted rudely by th' impartiall blade) Were it the subject of old Poetry, It had ere this an herb or flowre been made: Philip by Herbalists had beene enrould, Narcissus like, or Hyacynth of old. To leave his station he was hardly brought, Though he heard love and pity bid him fly To seeke his preservation, for he thought, He left behind the braver company: But mov'd by danger, and their love, he fled: Nature first shewes the ward to fence the head. Having outliv'd this massacre, he flies To Bray: and being question'd who was there, The Fortune of his France, the King replies. True: for the King and State like fortune share. Proteus hath many faces, so hath she, But Kings and subjects the same face doe see. Nor Frances strength nor fortune can prevaile: Fortune hath left no refuge but to fly. Soone as the King turn'd head, his men turn'd taile, And leave at once the field and victory. Soone turn'd the King, the army turn'd as soone, Thus a small rudder turnes a Galeone. Feare doth descend: for when inferiours do See wise men fearfull, and their betters fly, They think themselves are privileged so, That precedent this act doth justifie. If with this epilepse the head be tooke, Th'inferiour parts are in an instant strooke. But let them fly: it is enough, if we Can hold our owne, by standing on our guard, And provident defence; for policy Did teach the ranks might breake by following hard. Nor was it charity to chase them now; They had pursuers in them, feares enough. Nor could we tell what dangerous mischiefe lay To be hatch'd up under the wings of night, Which had even now discountenanc'd the day, And rob'd the noble office of the sight. Ruine might there be stumbled on, and we Had blinfold fought like the Andabatæ. The King congratulates his sonne for this Faire earnest of his future victories; And sealeth up his language with a kisse. With mute expressions the Prince replies: Silence hath Rhetorick, and veiles are best To portraict that which cannot be exprest. Wars greater tempest had forgat to blow, And horrours thicker clouds were driven away; But lighter mists, and weaker blasts did now Appeare to dim the honour of the day: Thus when a roring storme hath ceas'd to rave, A trembling noise still murmurs on the wave. When the next morn had blusht to see the field Looke redder than it selfe, in purple dight: Some scatter'd reliques willing to be kild, Meet rather with a slaughter than a fight. If the sound bodies of whole armies faile, Tis madnesse for sore members to assaile. Some troopes commanded by the Prior of France, And Roans Archbishop, run to meet the sword; And led by staring rashnesse, or blind chance, Fly to their death: as I have seene a bird Leaving the gentle hand, that kept it tame, Quit the soft pearch, and fly into the flame. These by the English breathing death are blown Out of the field: and day drawne out of night: So many Lords of France were overthrown, That yet I ne'r could judge, if that I might Or a misfortune, or an honour call That losse should alwayes on their Nobles fall. So many Nobles to account this day! And death finde not one English in her list! No English Nobles were that day to pay Mortality her dues: no Noble mist. Well may you think some Deitie did them shrowd, As Venus did her Troian in a cloud. FINIS. THE BATTAILE OF Poictiers under the Fortunes of Edward, sirnamed the Black. Not in full orbe as yet his honour shines: True honours orbes are fild by digits; grow By orderly additions: high designes Doe with methodicall progression goe. Tall Cedars by degrees advance the top. Tis mushrome honour in a night shoots up. Nature, the hand and instrument of heaven, With sober pace advanceth fairely on: Her peeces are produc'd by smooth and even Degrees, and grow by soft accession. Nature by mediums works, leaps not at all, And honour leapt to seemes unnaturall. But yet she stayes not, but doth gently pace In her continued march: and high-borne sp'rits Work, as a Faulcon to wring to her place Wins aire by constant circlings, not alights, Macedons heire could glory, he did raise His name by expeditions, not delayes. And though some pause to virtues acts be set, Yet no Herculean pillars: she must not Stand or retreat, but labour forward yet, In great attempts plus ultra is the mot. For virtues motion there's no period made, And 'tis a star must not be retrograde. Then on great Prince thou eldest sonne of Fame, Honours first-borne; continue still to adde Item to virtues, and weare a name Charg'd with more well-won titles than he had: Contest for thy inheritance in fame: More just thy interest, more faire thy claime. France was the Court wherein the case was tri'd, With title so apparant, proofes so cleare, His plea for honour could not be deni'd By justice brib'd: nay, if more worlds there were, And Philips sonne had triumph'd on them all, His suit for honours birthright here should fall. France is still sick, nor could the blood was lost At Crescey, her integrity restore: Her now more dangerous relapse must cost A dearer dose than was prescrib'd before: Th' originals of her distempers are The spirits and the humours of Navar. How is't Navar? too big for thy estate? Thy own much meanes, and kingdome of thy mother? It would take all thy thoughts to manage that, Nor leave one thought to think upon another. Much did I say? alas, there's nothing such, He that ne'r had enough, had never much. His state did ly like tinder on the fire Of his ambition, whose subtle heat At first did to the Constable aspire: He must be nothing, cause he is so great. We see some excellent worth markt out by fate, To be the Soveraignes love, and subjects hate. While he at truce with care, was layd a sleepe: (Sleepe the distinction betwixt men and gods) Navar and others enter'd, while none keepe A guard about him, but his curtaine rods. Where falling on him, mortally did wound him, And haply thought, they left him as they found him. King Iohn must temporize in this new case: Time will be waited on by Majesty: Tis proper to an action, as place To bodies: when the winds are contrary, Wise Pilots change their course: when they are for't They veere about, and make up to their port. Navar is promis'd favour, if he would But aske: he did: yet they did closely mue him: But this the Councell did but to uphold Publique respect, and his owne merit shew him. And for the greater state, three Queenes implore, To beg that pardon which was given before. Having obtein'd release, he goes away, And his wound with him: it had better been Those blowes had not been fastened, unlesse they Had been playd home enough: tis often seene, Such strokes are spurs to fury: who doth dare To strike, and not strike sure, a sleeping bare? He tenders up himselfe, his meanes, his friends, To Edwards service, who could well advance Such powerfull agents to atcheive his ends, And use a part of France to ruine France: You may a Kingdome enter when you please, If you have one within that keepes the keyes. Then he takes in some townes in Normandy, To make his party stronger: he beleeves His high offence must have security By acting greater projects; and conceives No puling suit for mercy can assure him, Continued rebellions must secure him. King Iohn must once againe the scene obey; Dissembling is his ward, not open war: He must have patience till at once he may Both apprehend occasion, and Navar. Time's a wilde thing, and hardly to be man'd, And if not watch'd, will never come to hand. Soone did occasion her lock present, For Charles the Dolphin being now at Roan, Navar to doe him honour thither went, But might have left that complement undone. Before they had halfe din'd, King Iohn did play The servitour, and tooke this guest away. Then from them all he culled out a messe, And too impatient of a longer pause, He did for them another banquet dresse, Who died without triall of the lawes: And without processe suffer'd in the place, And said their Nunc dimittis for their grace. Thus Damocles did sit at his rich fare, And yet not thus; for there the pendant blade Was truly held, though weakly, by a haire: But this dropt downe, and execution made: Our dangers and delights are neere allies; From the same stem the rose and prickle rise. The dreaming parties of Navar awake, Strooke with this fright: thus in a halfe made sleepe, When the deluding phantasie doth make Some horrid dreame, we still our slumber keepe, But when the fancy brings the danger neere To touch our selves, we are rows'd up by feare. Dreadfull confusion streamed from this blood, Without judiciall proceeding shed: King Iohn will be ingulfed in this flood, Nor all the hands of France hold up his head: His Kingdome is beheaded. To attone The losse of these foure heads, France lost her own. Harecourt and Philip brother of Navar Enrag'd saile over, and in England land: This massacre they to the King declare, And beg no boone but justice from his hand: Like to those Indians, that did never cry For ought but justice to their Deity. Lowd cry'd the murder, and they lowdly storme Against this great injustice: to proceed Without faire order of the Law, and forme, The case and persons unexamined: Till triall shall the doubtfull case assoile, The sword of justice should ly steept in oile. Edward imbrac'd the time; he had an eye Could levell this advantage to his end: He knew times declinations did ly Poiz'd on one moment, on one point depend. The metall's hot, and Edward must not hold, Twill no impression take, if it be cold. And that this expedition might be Maintain'd, the Parliament did grant to pay Such great taxations on their wools, that he Might spend sixe yeeres a thousand markes a day. That the firme base of Kingdomes may not reele, Tis laid on mines of gold, as well as steele. Edward resolv'd, foure thousand men did choose To be Postillians of his greater power Before the clouds open their lids, they ouze Some single teares to usher downe the shower. Glocester lands this force in Normandy, To be the prologue of the Tragedy. And now these martiall Revellers are set Vpon the Neustrian stage, with habits fit For their high parts: there forward Philip met To act that prologue, if they yeeld him it: As on a stage upon some fore-compact, You see two strive, who should the prologue act. But wisdome did their fortitudes unite, And wed this couple in a safer tie: When in one center many beames doe light, The heat is rais'd by this societie: And they conjoyn'd portended as much woe, As Iove and Saturne in conjunction doe. And in the quarrell of agreiv'd Navar Prevaile in Normandy; strong cities win, And force Carcasson; nor would fortune bar That cities gates where they would enter in. They shot without a counterbuffing shock, Like to a thunderbolt through Languedock. The townes yeeld up, only by feare agast, Not yet beseig'd; men by timidity Are on more dang'rous resolutions cast, Than by the wildnesse of temerity. Virtues defects nothing of her possesse, But rashnesse may, for that is an excesse. Nor was their time so cheap to cast away Vpon a lazie seige; this action Dies with her motion; prejudiciall stay Had kild their fairer processe. Philips sonne Did longer at one tedious leaguer lie, Than he was winning Persias Monarchy. It was their better way to overrun And spoile the champian: fires and weapons are The usefull instruments of destruction, In the advancing of the justest war, Which like a staring Basiliske doth waste, Kill with the touch, and with the breath doth blast. But in his conq'ring march proclaimes the cause, And justifying title of the war; Which was to vindicate the injurd lawes, And to redeeme imprisoned Navar: Which still in hold lay smother'd like a fire, Which should breake out, and raise his fury higher. Though many bonds doe mutuall aid invite, Yet to be man is a sufficient tie; Communion of nature bids us right And shelter innocence from injurie. States to the height of happinesse are growne, When others injuries are thought their owne. Nature on other creatures doth bestow Some naturall munition; but to man Nature gave man: who doth by nature owe All offices of piety; nor can The injur'd for their faults be bard tuition: We succour not the manners, but condition. Those wealthy summes this voyage to us gave, Which to King Iohn those Countries yeerely paid, Which did enervate France: though Kingdomes have Strong bones, and joints whereon their weight is laid. Yet all their actions dull, and sp'ritlesse prove, If without meanes, the sinewes which must move. But Gloster's not my theme: (though he too high For ablest quils to reach) I must retreat To Edwards quarters, and there vainly try To make his greatnesse make these measures great. The only muse I sue to, is his Name, And uncorrupt relation of his fame. Now France is gone to cure the wound was made By Glosters arme; and ready to apply His weapon-salve, he heares of Edwards blade Drawne at a fairer marke than Normandy. Gloster but wounded an inferiour limb; Edward aim'd at the heart, and miss'd not him. Led by this new occasion, and decree, King Iohn conducts his powers from Normandy, To entertaine yong Edwards men, for he Was prickt to lay the scene by destiny. Poictiers must beare the tempest of these wars, Drawn thither by the influence of his stars. But what makes Edward here? why doth he brave? And in an others Court himselfe sit Lord? Sure there's some cause; his fortitude must have As well the scales of justice, as her sword: For valours motion is irregular, where Iustice is not the mover of the sphere. And he that courting honour in the field, Would wed her nobly to his virtue, must Hold passion in; on a firme basis build, And know the causes of his war be just. Great actions if not founded deepe, will reele: The greatest ship must have the strongest keele. Tis th' only goodnesse of the cause, that can Be true incentive to the imps of Mars: For justice is mans virtue, as he's man: Event sits Iudge, awarding in those wars Right her desert; and wars ambiguous dy Runs well, if cast by the hand of equity. To procure peace, or keepe a foe at bay By warding injuries, cals a war just; But not to hug revenge, and make a way For brutish ferity; but that Kings must Keepe Kings in good opinion, that they know What a wrong is, and how to use a foe. Or to recover what our right hath been, And what's detein'd unjustly to regaine: Where justice ends, there justly wars begin. Our Edward thus did war in Aquitaine. Thus fierce Camillus taught the insulting Gaul To weigh the treasure, and restore it all. These are the sole conditions which can Make an invasion legitimate: Which notion printed in the Indian By natures finger, made him wonder at The woman-King Semiramis, that she Would wage a war, not touch'd by injury. Right stood for us: Navar had right in Bry: Glocester led an army in that right: And in his owne Edward did France defie: For right the Prince, for right did Gloster fight. For those false keyes which lock up justice, are The keyes which ope Ianus his doores of war. Edward unto the Prince that Dutchy gave, Confirm'd it by his Charter: with intent He should some care, as well as honour have, And verse himselfe in rules of government. It is an act that hath more glory in it, To rule a conquer'd state, than first to win it. King Iohn will settle upon Charles his sonne This very Dutchy; which did owe her state To Englands Edward, who confirm'd it on The Prince, with charge his right to vindicate. Kings do mark Kings proceedings; and to eye Their wayes is politick necessity. This was that Charles whom the French story write First Dolphin: Humbert broken at the chance Of's eldest sonnes decease, did give his right Of Dolphiny to Philip King of France. But with this caution confer'd the same, They should the heire of France the Dolphin name. He died in that noble company (Company be's comfort) were at Crescey slaine, Where Philip to allay his misery, Did win the by, although he lost the maine. He needs must owe one favour to his fate, Although he lost himselfe he won a State. Go vindicate thy right? a word that can Effect a wonder on lame cowardise, And teach it move: but to the Prince, a man To picture prowesse by; it did but this; Remove those lets which did his valour stay, Streames have selfe motions, take the dams away. Thus when a pondrous stone whose weight propends Down to the loved center, with a stop Hath an encounter, as it downward tends; And with that interposure is kept up; Whosoe'r shall displace th' impediment, Imparts no motion but by accident. Still had the King seene peaces smiling brow, And smoother front, had he not bard his foes Of that for which there was no right to show; As once a Pope the Indies did dispose, Which made the barbarous king to laugh at this, One should dispose of what was none of his. The revolution of affaires is writ In fortunes motley booke; which is compos'd Of pages black and white: King John thinks fit To study both, as if he had suppos'd Himselfe an ill proficient, should he looke Only upon the white ones in the booke. The unexperienc'd King dares sport with flame, And sindge his royall pinions; he doth thinke The bloody die of Mars is but a game; And thirsts wars bitter potions to drinke. His father dranke not all the viols up, Edward's his Doctor to dresse him a cup. He musters up his men, extracts the best Out of the English masse; Salsbury, Lile, Suffolk, and Warwick: men that might contest With antique worth, and lead the right hand file: Wise Princes have wise seconds; nor alone Imbark in actions: eyes see more than one. Suppose the generall wise, and valiant, Such the Commanders: yet if be propos'd Projects of consequence, they doe not grant They should in one brests conclave be dispos'd; But call a martiall Court, and there debate Which side makes best conclusion for the state. Captaines are armies heads; which heads must be The seat of reason and direction, whence Through the inferiour limbs of soldiary Discretion is infus'd by influence. Though ruddy Bacchus from Ioves thigh was ta'ne, Yet armed Pallas issu'd from his braine. Such were the soldiers here, and such the head: Mars could not here select a soldier out, But could command: no Captaine but could lead The Gods, when they against the Giants fought. Mars would have chose these soldiers in his wars, And Mars his soldiers Edward for their Mars. The Prince eight thousand sinewy archers brings Armed with fatall engines which were try'd, And never taught the foile; as if their wings Impropriated conquest to their side. Their whistling shafts alway victorious fly, Feather'd with plumes were pluckt from victory. A thousand men at armes cull'd out, did looke Like iron statues art had taught to goe, Which stood more firmely on the ground they tooke, Than Macedonias Phalanx e'r could doe. And as the Prince these fiery warriours led, He seem'd the starre some Comet followed. Some of the French Nobility adher'd; Captall de Buch, Montferrand, and D'Esparre: France knew that they were worthy to be fear'd: We, that their helpe was soveraigne in war. The Scorpion thus, as Nat'rallists do write. Is the best cure against the Scorpions bite. That which doth most distract and terrifie; The English were in divers parts of France: Whilst Glocester is yet in Normandy, Wales doth in Aquitaine the war advance. For in a war that hath more feats than one, More feare's diffused, and more pillage won. The Norman townes had been regain'd if Iohn Had not from thence by Wales diverted been. Pisa's thus saved from subversion, And dangerous leaguer of the Florentine; By the withdrawing of his powers from thence, To be imployed in his owne defence. And now my fancy sees great Edward rise, Mars his Enthusiast: his actions were Raptures of Valour, and deepe extasies Of man above himselfe: for drawing here His spirits from their matter, passed more Himselfe, than he surpass'd the world before. He on the stage of Aquitaine did play That part, which none beside can personate: In every course or found, or made a way, And prostrates as infallible as fate. Like to deaths harbinger his passage made, And there death lodged, where he lodg'd his blade. Cities of such a strength (that they had beene Abler t'ensure the Godlings from surprize Than lodging in strange shapes:) did let him in As if he had been keeper of the keyes And raining arrowes in a feather'd shower, He could have peirc'd more than a brazen tower. Some townes invited by their strength withstand, Not out of hope to stand, but out of shame: Some yeeld more to his name, than to his hand; For that had conquer'd them before he came. While some are forc'd, some yeelded as he went, And seem'd to have been won by precedent. Thus fall the shrubs, poore neighbours of an Oke, Whose top kisseth the clouds, whose root sounds hell Which vanquisht by th' assault of sturdy stroke, With groning fall the under wood doth fell, Small states sinke with the fall of greater states, The same their fortunes, and the same their fates. The strongest Cittadell, and stateliest Hold Gave entrance at the gates, or gaping rents, Ambitious of new landlords for their old: And Castles like so many monuments Gave up their men, who were strooke dead with feare, Summon'd to rise by Edwards trumpeter. There as through houses the mad fire was running, They seem'd like beacons all in flames, which were Not fir'd by France to tell the foe was comming, But by the foe to tell that he was there: Or else at once did those two places show Where Comets burne, and which they threaten too Clement the sixt of Rome, strikes in for peace, An act of which few of them guilty are; The Papacy arriv'd at the encrease Of her progression by forraine war. And since the Eagle did some plumes afford, It thriv'd lesse by the Keyes than by the sword. But Wales th' exact Idæa of a sonne, And true Commander, wisely did deny't: Vnwarranted from home had it beene done, He had entrench'd upon his fathers right. Th' injunctions of thy Prince must stand, not thine; The soule of Martiall feats is discipline. Out of this well-stor'd arcenall doe come Weapons, which are the hands of victory, And triumph's her rich crowne: why did old Rome Make their Victoria a Deitie, Which had not beene, much lesse had been divine, If not both made, and shrin'd by Discipline. Sterne Manlius yeelds his victorious sonne Vnto the Lictours axe, because he fought Without command, though challenged; and had won The day from Metius, and rich spoiles had brought, The losse of such a sonne doth rather choose, Than Rome the least of discipline should lose. Single example! sure yong Manlius saw Conquest was feisible: why then should he Give rather blind obedience to that law, Than win so coy a thing as victory? If new occasion faire advantage brings, We may apply our selves unto the things. No eare to lecture of soft peace is turn'd, Mars his red letters writ with sword and speare, Must still be read: his valour's but adjourn'd, Tis not prorogu'd: it was no period here, But as a breathing comma to the Prince; Such stops as these are spurs to violence. As I have seene come galloping amaine A gentle Knight, who meeting on the road An old freind long unseene, doth entertaine Some short discourse, then with his gingling goad Prick up Grashopper, and devoure the way, And win with speed, what he had lost by stay. And thus a streame proud with a fall of raine, Topping his bankes, and scorning the controule Of a poore chanell, winneth from the plaine, And with impetuous violence doth roule: But if some dam shall countercheck his waves, It breakes the dam and more insulting raves. The Prince shoots smoothly through without recoile, And townes so eas'ly homag'd to his name, As if he went but to receive the spoile Which Fortune had told out against he came; And with so swift dispatch effected this, That Cæsars Vici was but slow to his. As sensitives which with most swiftnesse move, Are fullest of best spirits: so actions are, Whose active heat makes them succesfull prove, And fortune waiteth most on such a war: Edward knew this, and he like lightning shone, At once he came, broke thorough, and was gone. Faire fortune was ingross'd to him by fate, Yet was he not more fortunate than wise: Wise as Huniades, as fortunate As Castriot, which two this one comprize. He seem'd to take townes at a cast, and get (As once Timoleon) cities in a net. This happy entrance strong impression makes, But different in the French, and English mindes: There it works terrour, here it courage takes; It credits ours, discredits their designes. These faire exordiums are the wayes to win, It is wars Rhet'rick bravely to begin. Now shiv'ring winter fledg with feather'd raine, Cover'd the earth with beds of watrish downe, Which warnes the Prince to quit the open plaine, And have his soldiers winter'd in a towne, Who unto Burdeaux unimpeach'd retreats, And for this yeere takes leave of Martiall feates. The peircing frosts candi'd in Gallick skyes, Against their countries foes would so combine, The tunicles should not secure their eyes, And all the humors would turne chrystalline: In their blue channels the red streames had stood, And spirits been congealed in that flood. Therefore the Prince will not his men bestow In fields unshelter'd, whilst the leagu'ring cold, And battering engines of chill ice and snow Assault the spirits, and surprize their hold. Who let their men i'th' field in winter ly, Both combat nature, and the enemy. The Sunne surrounding with a fleet careere On the highway of the Ecliptick line, Had inned in his winter signes this yeere, And at the goale his mounture did decline. Thus Edward to his winter Tropick came, Advancing through the Zodiack of fame. As when a fat and teeming soile is growne Fat, and o'rspent; and by its often birth Threatens a barren womb, the moyling clowne Fallowes the acres of his languisht earth: Thus Cheifes indulge their wearied soldiers rest, And husband valour in their fallow'd brest. Apollos yew is not at all times bent, It sometime feriates, and string is slackt: The sinewes of his lyre not alway rent With screwing torture, nor with winding rackt. These rests, and stops with sweet variety, Tune all our actions to a harmony. And thus the Sun, when he takes up his light, As 'twere to rest it in a misty shrowd: Will shew a face more glorious, and bright Thorough the breach of the dissolved cloud. Nay, thus my pen by only stay will write A smoother letter than it drew last night. Now had the Sun rid through his winter stage, And lighted at the lusty Ram: the earth With herbes, as Æson, did renue her age, And was impregnate with a numerous birth. Flora to ope her wardrobe did begin As 'twere to deck her at her lying in. The constellation of the winged Steed Rising with Sol, attempereth the aire To the radicall humour, and doth breed Blood in the strouting veines, and sp'rits repaire: Soldiers in spring double their service can, A man in winter is but halfe a man. The speckled Snake when he hath new put on His annuall coat, with seeming-triple tongue, Cals for the fight; and basked in the Sun, Is able or to give, or pay a wrong: But when th' earth lies like one great ball of snow, Alas, poore Snake, what mischeife can it doe. The Prince, who had in winter seem'd to set, Advanceth forward with th' advancing Sun: Doth not his resolute designes forget, Nor to consummate what he had begun. Not to promote what we doe once commence, Argues a weaknesse, and a diffidence. When great ones for great actions are bound, And sailed far i'th' voyage, they will not Turne for their honour, but be rather drown'd; Nor can perhaps: as those the gulfe have shot. Or not begin or finish, is a rule As well in Mars his as in Venus schoole. Nerves would bee cramp'd, the lazie blood would freeze; Limbs be unactive, should they longer ly; And if they still should sacrifice to ease, Valour would fall into a lethargy: Dull lakes are choakt with melancholick mud, Motions do cleere, and crystallize a flood. No body's healthfull without exercise; Iust wars are exercises of a State: Virtue's in motion, and contends to rise With generous ascents above a mate. Princes in motion with the spheres contest, Made more for veneration, than for rest. He still will be assailant, nor attend His dangers comming, (we may fall asleepe In watching danger;) he shall best defend His Kingdomes safty, and her honour keepe By just invasives: they that dare assaile, Are thought the strongest, and for that prevaile. By this first comming on Edward translates Danger to French from English: ancient Rome Had her most dangerous knocks at her owne gates, But fought with triumph, when shee fought from home. To war abroad is best security; Mischeifes great part is its vicinity. With uncontrouled march he did advance Through Bruges, Perigort, and Limosin: And seiz'd the bosome of affrighted France; The terrour of his acts usher'd him in. The lowd report of his victorious name Did execution long before he came. As when the nurses rod cannot appease The child; at th' hearing of some horrid name Tis husht: thus Turky with Huniades Stilled their children, saying that he came. A frightfull name's as forcive as a blow Both Edwards name and arme can overthrow. For he like light diffused in the aire, Spreads without opposition, meets no stay To check his faire proceedings, nor impaire His smoother fortune wheeling on her way. No lets encounter'd with his fortunes yet: They ran as smoothly as Musæus writ. As yet there's no abatement of his power, No blood expended, they did nothing meet Whereby they might disgust the wars; no sower As yet had been attemper'd with their sweet. Thus Arethusa slides through Neptunes bed, And keepes her maiden streame unravished. But what? no French that may our valour give Life by encounter? is it their intent To kill't by kindnesse, which by blowes must live, And be redeemed from its languishment? That unimployed fals in a swound, and then With blowes, not kisses, it is fetch'd agen. Or rather are the armes of frighted France Pinion'd with feare? what not a Chevaleere That for his mistresse sake dares try his lance, If not, for's country be a champion here? Yes: now their horsemen like a tempest come, Acknowledg'd then the flower of Christendome. King Iohn such unexpected haste did make, (His spirits heated with too quick a fire) He did the Prince at Poictiers overtake: He wing'd his hope, and imped his desire, As if he would his hasty fates importune, He might outrun his father in misfortune. Iohn, who dares say thou wert not Philips son, Heire to his crowne, successour in his fate? Twas thy inheritance to be undone: Ill fortune prov'd thou wert legitimate. The weight of Philips crowne did thee decline, Philips was made of thornes, and so is thine. The King mistooke it for a chase, and thought To overtake were to surprize his foe: As when a hound with snuffing long hath sought Through waylesse woods, which way the game did go. Rowses by chance a Lion for a Deere, And thus the French did rowse a Lion here. Vnder the heavy burthen of their power They seem'd to make the groning center yeeld, And with a cloud of men (able to shower Destruction on the world) darken the field. A whirlwind scowring from the Northerne waine, Did ease th'oppressed, cleare the darkned plaine. They had the ods of number six to one, A wonder by a sixth to be withstood: So many speares at once, and lances shone, Did in a champaine seeme to make a wood. But I have heard, a woolfe did never feare A flock of sheepe, how great so e'r it were. Let fond Tigranes in a proud despight Laugh at Romes handfull; and in bravery Brag to his men, they were too few for fight, And but too many for an embassie. They chas'd this bragart, and the conquest won, And made his honour set before the Sun. For 'tis not crab'd Arithmetick that must Be judge of valour: in th' exactest rate Of men, we weigh, not number them: nor trust Counters, but scales to give their estimate. Their quire was greatest, but the English are More skil'd in th' anthemes, and sad hymnes of war. They have the ods of country; the cause is Try'd in their Court; and we are forc'd to play In their owne alley: nay, they're strain'd by this To fight: they lose their country with the day, But in invasive wars abroad, we doe But lose our selves, and not our country too. Vpon the soile where thou wert borne, to flee, Cries bastard in thy face: is it not just To pay her life, which once did lend it thee? Thou ne'r couldst better dy, and once thou must. Give me a Cock that ne'r durst strike a blow, Vpon his dunghill he will beat his foe. Nay, as if fortune had a patent lent For France t'ingrosse all the advantages: Ods in conceit: conceit, an instrument, Which though phantastick, breeds realities. The pregnant mothers strong imagination Hath given her womb a reall alteration. The King of France his army did draw out, And on a spacious plaine embattelled: His numerous multitude he wheel'd about Like the First mover; and the fields did spread With traine too long, and wings too short to fly Vnto so high a pitch as victory. His hopes had now impos'd on his beleefe, That he already had the victory: He thinks that tedious, which all else thinke breife: He meanes to joyne his battaile presently. Desires are hasty, and when hopes are strong, Minutes are lazy, and compendiums long. He's highly rais'd by flattering conceit And selfe opinion, that he might be strooke With greater ruine from so great a height: As when an Eagle hath some shell-fish tooke, She beares it up aloft, that she may breake That with a fall, she could not with her beake. They think to scourge our Heros, and with steele Whip this yong warriour, who now was made Professour in his art, and scorn'd to feele Check or correction from the proudest blade. It will not come into their memories, That he at Crescey fought his master prize. Scorning the petty numbers which we brought, They rate us pris'ners more than enemies: And against light of truth, and nature thought, That efficacious force in number lies. He is blind hardy, that will dangers slight, For they grow heavy, when they once seeme light. 'Mongst natures utensils you cannot see A thing so poore, but may be instrument To shape great actions; though the object be Tough to receive, untoward to be bent. The power that gives all actions their lawes, Prepares the object, and exalts the cause. If chance claim'd not an interest in tents, And schooles of Mars; then the French numbers might Seeme in good eyes enforcing arguments For strong conclusions: but she claimes such right, That 'tis a question, whether Rome had more Set upon Virtues, or on Fortunes score. But France hath greater opposition here Then single fortune: had we cowards beene, She had empark'd us like a heard of Deere: But in so few ne'r was more valour seene. A multitude could never make a head Against fierce Lions, if by Lions led. While the French, swolne with vaine and sickish hope Of victory, are ready now to burst In feav'rish choler on the foe; the Pope With fatherly prevention tried first If for such fevers any thing might be A soveraigne cure besides phlebotomy. To mediate betweene this mighty paire He sent two Cardinals: the French withstood With eares of proofe, and fortified 'gainst prayer, Their Crosier staves could here do little good: Nay, if the Herault of the Gods had come, He might have broke his rod, and so flowne home. We were too far gone in this Maze to fly, Nor humane judgement could present a light To shew us out: Time and necessity Advise the Prince leane to peace, which might Not be inglorious, and give a blow Vpon his honour deeper than a foe. Lest he lose all, the Prince will lose a part, And disengage himselfe at any rate. Wisdome adviseth the most generous heart To bend with th'inclination of his state. Wee meet with fortunes shocks, and beare her weights By stooping, not by standing at our heights. But France presuming fatally there are Vpon her side matchlesse advantages; Will heare no musick but the sounds of war, The hymnes of peace are but dull aires to these. Thus Semele the thundercrack will heare, And die with that which only pleas'd her eare. Their ventrous King will desperately play To win a penny, or to lose a crowne; And lose himselfe with losing of the day: Yet might have stayd his hand, and not have thrown Fish with a golden hooke, and lose that hooke, It cann't be valu'd, with what could be tooke. The Prince beset with strong objections, Of opposits can no evasion see: Would therefore yeeld to all conditions, And yeeld up all things but himselfe, and he Cannot be guilty of such base controule, Whose body't selfe's no prison to his soule. As at that sea-fight when the windes doe try To dispossesse rugg'd Neptune of his right: And both combine against an Argosie Which rather would be neuter in the fight: The master casts his goods into the sea, As t'were the ransome that should set him free. But they will Edward have to satisfie Their high desires: Edward must basely yeeld Himselfe a pris'ner: nay, he'll rather die, Than yeeld, and liue: nay, 'fore he quits the field, He'll take their King. Tis just, he that will choose To take thy freedome, should his freedome lose. He gives conditions, as if we were Now in his hands, and really possest In's overweening thoughts: and doth not feare Our fortune, or our valour: but profest Hee'd set us lawes. But Edward thought it fit Those lawes like Draco's should in blood be writ. His articles at first did terrour strike, And did our minds in dark suspenses hold, But ended things to laugh at; not unlike The armed charets in the fields of old, Wherein both sithes and speares were borne: Were first a terrour, afterward a scorne. To yeeld ones selfe, and yeeld before a blow, Cals indignation from a Cowards brest: He could not yeeld his honour to his foe, For others had in that some interest. He had deceiv'd country, and King, for he To them for's honour must accomptant be. Liberty is devolved to the sonne, Which doth enhance its price: as you have seene Something preserv'd with great religion, Only for this. It had his grandsires beene. Tis priz'd but by conjecturall conceit, Like an old peece for which there is no weight. His life and honour at the stake did ly, Set to be throwne at in this martiall game: He'll therefore lose his life couragiously, To keepe from forfeit his engaged fame: And with a fearlesse progresse dangers meet, Life not in length, but in the use is sweet. The King of France an errour did commit, And wars for errours scarse have second roome: Had he but tim'd it, and not joyned yet, We eas'ly would to composition come. Fortune's a market, if a while you stand, Things will grow cheap, and fall into your hand. Had reason given him patience to stay Till time were ripened, we had been too weak To fight, if elder by a month: delay Had crumbled us, whom valour could not breake: It is a rule Cheiftaines to Fabius ow, To get the conquest, and not strike a blow. We could not with provision be stor'd He might have cut it off without a blow: Famine had beene more forcive than the sword; But he will fondly buckle with the foe: And by his folly make our fortune great: Serpents prove Dragons when they Serpents eat. Good King; he did his resty passions ride Without a bit: who in their wilde carere Dash him on this, then on the other side, Then give a fall, which he did never feare. But to his passions attribute not all; Something on times vicissitudes must fall. Great actions are not molded out of hand, They aske their time for just conception, Lest they should prove blind issues: they demand A first, and second agitation; And are on arguments of counsell tost, Or else on fortunes waves, and there are lost. When mature counsell hath concluded what Is to be done; and how contriv'd, we need Dispatch, the life of things, to practise that: Consult at leisure, prosecute with speed. Which Titus by his emblem well descri'd, A nimble Dolphin to an anchour ti'd. King Iohn admits no consultation To ripen his designes, as if 't had bin Too short a time for his destruction: Grapling with dangers brings them sooner in. Actions are weakened with too hasty speed, Thus predigestion doth diseases breed. Heads are the wombs where actions must be Conceiv'd, and fashioned in all their parts, And stay the time of just delivery, Or else the head miscarries, and aborts. A hudling haste shapes no production right: Iove could not get the Muses in a night. He kens not precedents that went before, But with erected, and ambitious eye, Thinks on surmis'd advantages to soare, Nor minding what's before him to mount high. Thus a seeld Dove with right up mountures flyes, Because she sees not, what before her lyes. If he had but his fathers Legend read, There had been lectures to have taught him wit: The name of Crescey might have strooke him dead, To think like fortune might attend us yet. Heav'n destining a fall, muffles the eyes, And whom it will destroy, it stupefies. And though it could by't selfe, if it would choose, Confound this sacrifice of ruine, yet It doth for meanes, those dispositions use Inherent in the person that is set For mark. Perdition from our selfe proceeds, As selfe disorder selfe diseases breeds. When some did th' Emperour Charles the fourth advise To dare the Turkish Cressant, he refus'd; Cause through the current of all histories He saw much blood was in those wars effus'd. The ancient times what is the best do show, The moderne teach what is most fit to doe. Historians to some Courts have had recourse By Kings commands; who did of them explore The former age: that they might steere their course As skilfull Pilots of great states before, And cut out all their actions by the thred Of ancient times. Best Doctors are the dead. When Zeuxis did his Iuno goe about, From the choise shapes of th' Agrigentine dames He cull'd the rarest of perfections out. Thus Princes do arrive at highest names; For they the best of all examples take, When they the Iuno of their power do make. Their former suffrings might instructions be: 'Tis best anothers madnesse to enjoy: They might their owne through other danger see: And with what fate we did our shafts employ: From fire which hath once burnt it to refraine, Moves in the circle of an infants braine. Though fooles from wisdome doe derive no wit; Whose better deeds touch not their observation. Yet from their losse wisdome hath benefit, And in their errours reads an information. He that shall see a ship run on a shelfe, Is mad if he will run upon't himselfe. When Archimedes engines once had fear'd, And did at Syracuse the Romans maull, Not one in all the leaguer once appeard, But stood the space of danger from the wall. If they a peece of rope, or wood did spy, Supposing it an engine, they would fly. Iohn in's owne losse will read instruction, And try experience on himselfe; they sing To a deafe rock who tune persuasion: The Card'nals is dull Rhet'rick; for a King Not to be forced, is a glorious state, But not perswaded, is a dangerous fate. For though the faults of private men may be Stayd in themselves: a Princes may redound And be reflex'd on thousands: thus at sea Men by a shipboys fault are rarely drown'd; But if the Pilot shall a fault commit, They're cast upon the ground, or sunk, or split. Wise Cheifes would purchase, were it to be sold, A foes returne: which made that Worthy say, If he will go, make him a bridge of gold, No metall is too deere to pave his way. Vnwelcome oppositions will at length Create a sudden fury, and new strength. Force when it meets a yeelding object, dies; Shoot at a wall of mud, 'twill dull the blow: But it gets life by contrarieties, As is observ'd in motion; none can throw A cork so far, as he can throw a stone, 'Cause this resistance makes, and that makes none. The French well mounted did so firmely ride, They seem'd some monster made of man and beast: Thus rid the Centaures by Enipus side, Invited to Perythous his feast Nessus did fall by great Alcides bow, Thus the French Centaures had their overthrow. Iohn on his horse the confidence did lay, And thinks he sooner shall upon their speed Alight at th' hope and honour of the day; But this opinion did an errour breed. An eye through water measures nothing streight, Nor wisdome through the glasse of preconceit. His camp of so much matter did consist, And forme so little, that it scarce could roule That grosnesse, which inclines what way it list, As if not actuated with a soule; Or if it were aliue, it reeld about, Like the vast Cyclops when his eye was out. He sees not how the Prince had laid his men Close in a bushy, and unequall ground; His horse, though better, could do nothing then; And while at once they feele the arrowes wound, And windings of a bush, they doe mistake, They feele the stinging of some winding snake. A ground (as I have seene some dining roome, Whose seeling Art hath cut in wandring Vines, So that by nature) where no horse can come, But is supplanted by th' intangling twines. The creeping Vines with their erroneous course, Were made by nature shackles for their horse. Chance the great stickler in this worlds affaire, (Cheifly in that of war) did Edward choose To be the greater favourite of the paire, And have the ground which he could wisely use: Though Fortune wants the fortune to be ey'd, Her pace is sure, if virtue be her guide. He knew those places most commodious were, And advantagious against their horse: They could not for the ground approach too neere: So he in place was greater, lesse in force, And wins by that: for conquest in some case, Is not got more by valour, than by place. We borrow'd this advantage from the place, The French Kings errour did another make; No place was giv'n by merit, but by grace, Which makes deservers cold to undertake. When no faire aspect shineth on deserts, There is a dearth presag'd on Armes and Arts. Three hundred horse he culled from the rest, The rest conceiving it a high neglect, Think themselves worst, 'cause others are thought best, And 'gin to envy whom he did select. Envy's a race, in which the runners minde Those who do run before, not who behinde. In great designes we such impressions see Impeach an action, where the minde must look Point blank upon the work, not squinting be By the affections from the bus'nesse took. A shaking eye hath an uncertaine sight, And minds by passion moved, aime not right. Vext by disgrace, they discontented grow, And thus distracted, either study why They were rejected with dislike, or how To be reveng'd for such an injury; And readier are to double their despight, Than animate their courages to fight. Distasts that have from Envy tooke their life, Have strongest constitutions, and doe dy Much later than the most inhumane strife, That had a being from an injury. Ten yeeres will wheele Troys destiny about, But Rome and Carthage for whole ages fought. The Prince helpt by these errours, and the ground Strengthen'd by nature, where his men were laid, Vs'd art to make it stronger than 'twas found, That it might more unpassable be made, Rests not in what was by mere nature done, Art is to perfect what that hath begun. The night before, ditches and trenches cast So wide, they might not by the horse be leapt: His archers close behind the banks were plac'd, From whence they shot, and were so safely kept, That I would prove, and by no proofe but this, The place conserveth what conteined is. Yet it were weaknesse, if he were content With strength of place; and therefore that he might Have brests as fortifi'd, he did present His men with the necessity to fight. When a needs must commands us to begin, We lose with honour, or with wonder win. When soldiers hem'd in desperation stand, They have in courage what they want in hope; Necessity in wars strengthens the hand, In arts the head: and there it found a Trope. A dying serpent doth most venome cast, Valour fights deadly, when she fights her last. His men with obstinacy armed so, And resolution, that the farewell breath Of Edwards gasping men could blast a foe: And if no friends would vindicate their death, Yet this should be their comfort, here to dy, Should be their birth-day to eternity. What e'r his worth did, like Elixar, touch, If that the metall were dispos'd to worth, It render'd it by the contaction such: And as the Loadstone sheds its virtue forth, And gives it selfe to this, from this to that, So Edward doth himselfe communicate. And now with horrour I the French espy Come rouling o'r the champaine like a flood: Their swords like scourging Comets in the sky Prognosticated deluges of blood To drowne us in, but that the English bow, Like the propitious meteor, sayd no. They came, as I conceive a river made By the dissolved snows upon a hill, Which in the precipice cannot be stayd: But when the weight of this impetuous rill Hath beene unladed on the plaines beneath, It softly creepes, as 'twere it selfe to breath. Here you may see their foremost troop of horse, With a resolved bravery charge the banks; There see the ruder archers breake their course, And spoile the method of their order'd ranks. Thus 'gainst a rocke deepe founded in the maine, The waves oft sally, oft repulst againe. There see their second troope so close compact, As if that all should but inflict one stroke, And be but as one person in that act: But falling on our men at armes are broke: Thus on the stones a storme of haile doth fall, It breaks it selfe, and doth no hurt at all. Now see the third ride forward in a brave, Then backward beat, then vanish out of sight: As I have seene a straw slide on a wave, Vntill encounter'd with a narrow streight, Then forward, backward, and about it whirles, And then is swallow'd in the spongy curles. Th' edge of their razour valour soone did break, And could not hold, because not built upon A resolution; but that we were weak, Remove this cause, and that effect is gone. Rashnesse her heat but to first onsets brings, Then slugs, like wasps, when they have lost their stings. Yet they those weaker places flockt about, Which did best guards and opposition want. Thus the Rhinoceros with armed snowt Wounds the soft belly of the Elephant. Experience teacheth man, nature a beast, T' assault the weakest, unattempt the rest. We had been ouerlaid with numbers now, And if declining had been crushed quite: The body of our army did not bow, But standing right is setled with the weight. Imposed weights columnes which leane deface, But standing streight, doth fix them on their base. Had Plato seene this army, he would sweare, (Ravish'd to see such wonders done by men) Valours Idæa had existence there, And ne'r before vouchsaf'd to lodge with men. Valour so high, that whatso'er may be Conceiv'd of it, is no hyperbole. Here Edward fought, and there the French men fly, Whilst he an alley through their quarters made: They count it not a harme, but grace to dy, If that their deaths were honour'd with his blade. No Herault shows an armes of such a note, As where his weapon gave the bloody coat. So sublimate, and subtile was the flame With which his spirits glow'd in this great strife: That when Prometheus a man did frame, And wanted fire to give his creature life. Had he been here, he never had gone higher, And not rob'd Heav'n, but Edward for this fire. Tell me not of the fatall sheild of Rome, That fell from heav'n into grave Numa's lap, Nor of her mother Troys Palladium, Whose losse was the vancurrier of mishap. He was of more importance in this field, Than either Troys Palladium, or Romes shield. There Audley stood, thus Diomed did stand, When he the God of Battaile did defie: His flaming sword came lightning from a hand Of as swift execution as his eye. The bloody lines which there his steele did write, Were perfect copies how the world should fight. Renowned Audley who did vow to stand, First in the battaile, and didst seale thy word With many wounds; take from thy Princes hand Five thousand marks feesimple for reward. When such a Sun as Edward lustre showes, Reward's the shadow that with virtue goes. Who is that? Warwick? yes 'tis he, be gone, He is deaths swordbearer who went before To make death way, which else could have found none, He slaughter'd many, and affrighted more. The thunderdart, though but on one it fall, Yet doth it strike a terrour on them all. There come the common soldiers, who did light Their valour at their Captaines; no commands Of Leaders, but examples make them fight; They seem'd like Briareus with's hundred hands. And if employ'd, they could as well as he Have rescu'd Iupiter, and set him free. That which the Cardinall foretold, was true, That since he could not move, the stones should cry; For when their arrowes were consum'd, they threw Their bowes away, and made the pibbles fly. Their shot was stones, their arcenall the lands, Their slings their armes, their stonebows were their hands. So many heaps of slaughter'd men did raise The field in swelling hils, that no man will Have faith enough in these last faithlesse dayes, To think the sword so many men could kill; But rather that some stroke from heav'n did fall, Or spreading sicknesse did infect them all. Those who are under Sagittarius borne, If Chaldee wizards truly calculate, Expire not naturally, but are torne Like twigs stript off by violence of fate: Vnder what these were born, though none can tell, I know they under Sagittarius fell. The Scepticks, Pyrrohs schollers, doe beleeve Death not concernes humanity a jot: (For death is not when they are yet alive, And when death is, then they themselves are not) Could not for all the braves they write or say, Meet death with more resolvednesse than they. Those witty feigners of antiquity, That with a drop was from some lover shed, Could give a tincture to the mulbery, And make her paler greene looke sanguine red, Had they then lived, and this field had seene, There had no fruit in all the world beene greene. When all the stars in the same point are met, Wherein they were when this great field was fought, And shall be in the same position set, This act (say some) shall come againe about. But this concludeth that opinion vaine, So high a feat cannot be done againe. So many suffer for the Kings offence, (The Greeks were punish'd, and the Generals sin) Subjects are plagu'd, and in them the Prince; It ends in them, and did begin in him. Thus Physick makes th'ignobler members bleed For a distemp'rature lies in the head. See in that heap one man among the rest, Vnder those bleeding carcasses survive; And by the weighty multitude opprest, Themselves unburied bury him alive. And must be pleas'd with this unequall lot, The living shall have graves, the dead have not. One lower by the head, whose growth a blow Had spoild: a blow some Curtleaxe let drive. Kicks with his feet, as if he meant to show, He had an anger could himselfe survive. Thus a dismembred snake, when newly slaine, With head topt off, will menace with his traine. Here armes lopt off, put them in minde to use The service of their legs in time, before They shall those necessary members lose. Here one that lost a leg fretted, and swore At his owne madnesse, he so long should stay, That now he could not run, but hop away. There see a man, who, had his heart been good, And perfect as his legs, had scap'd the foe; Who in a chilling feare congealed stood, And had the heart, yet not the heart to goe, He's slaine in his affright: thus at a bush The bullet striketh the amazed Thrush. There might you see a helmet full of head, Like to an iron monument stand out: Here all the field with plumes of feathers spread, Which mocked by the winds, did fly about. The hov'ring plumes presented to their sight, Was a presaging emblem of their flight. Here Iohn of France with steely wand did show Wonders, encircled in a hostile ring: There noble Philip ran the army through To disengage his father and his King. Thus Affrican amongst the thickest ranks Fought for old Scipio at Ticinus banks. That noyse of horrour, To the King, the King Makes all forsake him; while his valiant sonne Bringing such aid, as single strength could bring, Is christned Hardy for this action. When others were cut down, these Worthies stood, And look'd like storers in a new faln wood. But now he's prisoner: yet did behold His bondage with so firme, so sweet an eye, And brow so ev'n, as if he meant to hold Some paradoxes against liberty. A soule resolved, and well squared man, Fals on his base, through fortune, how she can. But what is this I heare? ô, 'tis fly, fly, Or a rude noise of soldiers that would live, And in confusion for quarter cry, Which should they sooner aske, he'd sooner give. Valour and Mercy are the fixed Poles On which the sphere of Edwards honour rowles. It is the first revenge, when feare shall bow The proud opposer; and best victory To triumph over stomachs, and to throw The soules, not bodies of the enemy. And 'tis the height of punishment, to see Thy foe for mercy humbled at thy knee. Kings are Gods pictures, and their mercy lends Best life unto the peeces: clemency And gentle moderation best commends Their acts, and doth their fortunes beautifie, These glorious lustres are the varnish cast, To make their deeds not only shine, but last. Mercy declar'd unto a foe, doth show W' are cit'zens of this world, and would not be Cut off by ferity; and lets men know No sep'ratists are in humanity. Here we maintaine communion, for our hearts Are Continents, not Iles from other parts. King Iohn with humble state is entertein'd, Not dealt with roughly as an enemy: Edward by valour his first conquest gain'd, And wins a second by his courtesie. Base Wolves and Beares still urge a yeelding foe, Edward's a Lion, and he cann't doe so. Tis proper to choise spirits to releeve, As well as conquer men, and when they dy, It will more crowne their memory, to leave Favours, than conquests in their diary. But looke for ruine when a coward wins, For feare and cruelty were ever twins. In midst of triumph heare the cryer say, Remember thou art man, to moderate Thy fortune: on a steepe descent we stay Our selves, and horse: thus in a high-rays'd state We use a moderation, and begin On fortunes steepe to reine our passions in. The constitution of the soule is cleane, That can digest great fortunes, which converts To wind, and humour, and is rarely seene Free from impoisoning the noblest hearts. It is the best felicity, to be Not foild, and vanquish'd by felicity. So many pris'ners in this battaile tooke, Who did into the armes of mercy yeeld, As might have taken us: at the first looke They seem'd enough to win againe the field; Save that these ods did for the English stand, One keeper can ten prisoners command. So many noble Lords did write with blood, And seale with wounds, that France did love her King, As if the Nobles did not think it good, The commons should their testimony bring To ratifie this truth: themselves will be Th'only subscribers to this verity. Edward forbad the chase of those that fly, And whilst the soldiers for the booty sought, He joy'd in th' honour of his victory: For pillage is beneath a Gen'rals thought: Impli'd by him that said: Gather thou these My freind, for thou art not Themistocles. Then gave them sepulture, which is allow'd By the commerce of war, and humane right: Where earth upon the dead is not bestow'd, They brutishly against those dead doe fight, And passe revenges bounds: this debt we owe To th' nature, if not person of the foe. Edward the heav'ns doth humbly gratifie, Whose stars had for him in their courses fought, And led him by the hand to victory, And like sure convoies, through his dangers brought. Timotheus thrives not after he denies A share to fortune in his victories. Conquests are heav'n faln things, and Victours bayes Are wreath'd and platted there: when Rome did send Armies abroad, she did such Leaders raise, Whom good successe and fortune did commend, As well as prowesse; and did ev'ry where More shrines to Fortune, than her Virtue reare. Then he bestowes rich largesse on his men, T'enflame their minds, that if they did not love Virtue for her owne selfe, rewards should then Win their loves to her, and their dulnesse move. Reward is the great pillar of a state, Which doth support as strongly as her fate. A gen'rous spirit is not drawn, but led To stake a life, and hazard it in war: Soldiers their blood will liberally shed, Where free rewards and liberall guerdons are. Aurelian takes this counsell: to bestow Gold on his men, and iron on his foe. Then heightens them with commendation: praise Is the reflexion doth from virtue rise: These faire encomiums doe virtue raise To higher acts: to praise is to advise; Telling men what they are, we let them see, And represent to them, what they should be. And they were worthy of it: Rome n'r saw An army yet, to which this host would yeeld; Nor braver Chiefe than Edward e'r did draw Her pow'rfull legions into the field. Edward shall mate the proudest He of Rome, Let Cæsars selfe, her great Dictatour come. When Rome had conquer'd all the world beside, Then, and but then she durst attempt the Gaules, Gaules who before her powers did deride, And oft had scourged her at her owne wals. Rome never durst the stubborne Gaul defie, 'Till she had not another enemy. But England had another pow'rfull foe, The hardy Scot to threaten from the North Incursions; yet then did Edward goe From home, and lead with him an army forth; And spight of Oracle a conquest win, Which said, we should with Scotland first begin. Victorious Cæsar led experienc'd men, Custom'd as well to conquests as to fights: Those whom Heroick Wales conducted then, Were but mere novices in Mars his rites: New chang'd the whip for sword, the share for sheild, And Ceres fat for Mars his bloody field. The Gaules indeed were resolute in war, Whom Cæsar with his legions vanquished, Yet were those Gaules inferiour by far Vnto the French: for the French conquered The Gaules, who could not then themselves defend, Ev'n when Romes selfe did them assistance lend. Ariovistus with his Germans had The Gaules in slavery (a great allay To the best temper'd spirits) and had made Factions to take their soveraignty away: Seditions are the rils, which at the length Weaken the current and maine streame of strength. When Christendome did in distraction ly Vnder the Arrian faction, and did grone Rent by the schisme of his wilde heresie, And fumed in this mad combustion, Then Mechas Pseudoprophet Mahomet came, Th'incendiary of a greater flame. But now the French were free, a setled state, And fixt to the obedience of one Lord: A King for fame, and fortune, wondred at; Vnder his colours Kings did draw the sword. A King for whom, one did himselfe bereave Of rule for love; and one for mony leave. Against a state thus strong, and setled thus, Edward durst come with an unpractis'd few: The French had more advantages of us, Than Cæsar of those Gaules he overthrew. And yet there were more marks of valour made In France by th' English, than the Roman blade. Then why hath History so copious been In old Romes strength, as if it meant to say, Not what should win beleefe, but wonder win: Thus Alexander left in India So great an armour, which should rather be T' amaze, than to informe posterity. Mighty Third Edward thou didst propagate Strength in thy children, though we often see Their seed degen'rous, and 'tis thought a fate, The sonnes of Heroes should a blemish be: Pure was the graine, when it at first was sowne, But it hath many husks when it is growne. Who hath in virtues Zenith seated beene, Swerves farthest in his fall: a mighty spright Highly sublim'd, is stranger to a meane, And is not foil'd in sinne, but fals downe right. And for the sins which such great Sires have done, The heav'ns have oft tooke vengeance on the sonne. And sometime too great men uxorious are, (Such was Themistocles) and let their wives With too indulgent education mar The hoped fortunes of their childrens lives. Children, like water on a table spilt, Are eas'ly drawne into what shape thou wilt. Or while those fathers are abroad imployd, Lesse care is had of their minority: Or 'tis to shew perfections are not ty'd To the succession of a family; For all the things and actions of the world Are in a circular conversion whirld. But noble Edwards fortitude descends Downe to his sonnes. This royall Eagle breeds An airy of true Eaglets, not commends Doves to the world: a valiant race succeeds This valiant father: ne'r could Heros vaunt Of two such mighty sonnes, as Wales and Gaunt. Who could Castile as well as France controule, When Pedro dispossess'd, their armes requir'd: But Ile sit downe untill some richer soule With a diviner Calenture enfir'd, O'r the Pirenes shall those triumphs sound, My Muse at farthest but to France was bound. Now farewell Lords who seeme t'have throwne despaire Vpon the world; which feares, while it shall last It hardly shall be crown'd with such a paire; For nature lost the moulds where you were cast, Or else in making you it spent such store, That it hath scarse materials for more. Sleepe feared soules: and 'till an Angell wake you, Let peace seale up your monumentall stones: And were it not a sacriledge to take you, And weare for amulets your sacred bones, Those bones a better omen would become, Then mighty Castriots, or great Ziscas Drum.
