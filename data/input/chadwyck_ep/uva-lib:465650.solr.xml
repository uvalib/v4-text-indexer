      <field name="fulltext">[Volume 1] PASTORALS. PASTORAL FIRST. Inscribed to the Albion Fair. ? Nunc scio quid sit amor. Virg. By flow'ry banks of Tweed, whose waters glide Thro' famous valleys, crown'd with rural pride, Young Colin led his flock, as summer gay, And healthful as the bounteous gift of May. Yet mourn'd the swain; for, pierc'd by sad despair, The slave of love, and its consuming care, Along the willow-fringed banks he stray'd, While sighs the anguish of his heart betray'd: Hung o'er the flood a shady poplar grew, This as he lean'd, the falling tears bedew; On this he gaz'd, and while his sorrows flow'd, Warm kisses on the letter'd rind bestow'd. Fair Albion Dames! to whose love-darting eyes The vanquish'd world resigns bright Beauty's prize; By Love inspir'd, I sing his tender strains; My tale of love the cruel fair disdains: Tho' the cold maid my numbers fail'd to move, In vain I sing not while your smiles approve; Accept my verse, the fav'rite page shall shine, And sacred myrtle round my temples twine. Ye woodland scenes! where vainly I retire, Defence from Phœbus', not from Cupid's fire; Ye shady beeches! listen to my strain, Inspir'd by Delia, and her proud disdain; Sad Colin, doom'd her cruel scorn to prove, To you, ye rocks! declares his hopeless love. Cold hearted maid! for thee, in early bloom, I waste, neglected, and in tears consume; In peace retir'd, my happier days were spent In harmless pleasure, and in calm content. On balmy wings each smiling summer came, And found me careless by the cooling stream: When gloomy winter vex'd the troubl'd air, Safe from his storms I watch'd my fleecy care: At village feasts, amid the rural throng, I rul'd the dance, and rais'd the simple song; Or drove my flock to pasture o'er the lee, Happy from love and wild ambition free. All conqu'ring love! I feel thy tyrant reign, Inspir'd by thee, I burn and waste in vain: Ye gods! what magic can our hearts secure, What art can shield us from thy mighty pow'r! The fiercest souls thy matchless force can move, And gods themselves have felt all conqu'ring love. Too well thy nature and thy pow'r I know, Now hapless left to unremitting woe. No more from harmony I hope for ease, Nor flow'ry lawns, nor sunny fields, can please; All nature's beauty yields no joy to me, For nature saddens, since despis'd by thee. The breath of mildew kills the vernal bloom; With dire disease the harmless flocks consume; Chill winter blasts the glory of the year, Thy scorn, O Delia! is the plague I fear. Sweet are soft slumbers on the verdant plain; Sweet cooling fountains to the thirsty swain; Sweet gentle sunshine, or descending show'rs, To fervent bees, or to the drooping flow'rs; Thou, Delia, all my hope, and, without thee, What's joy, or sun, or life itself, to me! Come, lovely nymph! thy cruel scorn resign; Come, lovely nymph! and feed thy flocks with mine. Happy with thee, thro' flow'ry fields I'll stray, Or waste, in pleasing toils, the summer's day; Your snowy flock to freshest pasture lead, Or by the breezy shore, or verdant mead Irriguous, where the purple vi'lets glow, The strawb'ries ripen, and the roses blow; There, soft reclin'd, and banish'd ev'ry care, I'll sing, or wreath with flow'rs thy beauteous hair. Now all around me breathes the blushing year, Prideful the trees their flourish'd branches rear; From fragrant blooms the grateful odours rise, And hopeful harvest glads the shepherd's eyes; All nature smiles, the hill, the flow'ry plain, Love, only love, no kind return can gain. Come, charming maid! for thee my bow'r is crown'd With roses, balmy woodbine breathes around; O'er the green turf my spotless wool is cast, And choicest fruits afford a rich repast: Besides, while rival nymphs my favour woo With gifts, their gifts are all reserv'd for you: Ev'n blooming maids have su'd my love to gain, And am'rous nymphs prefer their gifts in vain; With me their charms no kind acceptance boast, In thine alone all other charms are lost. Nor of unseemly form, nor rustic mien, As late I view'd me in the chrystal plain. Let others boast the gay effeminate air, The boyish wiles, which gain the trifling fair; The manly feature, void of Lydian art, Tho' brown with toil, will gain the worthier heart. Ah! guileful spite, and faithless love, destroy My blasted prime! which braves the joint annoy Of storm inclement, and the scorching sun, By woman's stern ingratitude undone! Besides, the rural throng, my Doric lays, Beneath the shade, in crouding circles, praise; The wood nymphs fair, the village maidens bring Their gifts, and round me dance in jocund ring; And the harmonious sisterhood impart Their magic pow'rs to melt the feeling heart. Ah! wretch! the only nymph I sing to gain Repays with scorn, and mocks the shepherd's strain. The bleating sheep, the rugged rocks return My wild complainings, and in pity mourn: In vain I sing, while she disdains my lay, Ah! heart insensate! and more hard than they. I burn! I burn! as woodland shades consume, Conceive destruction, and assist their doom. O when wilt thou thy killing scorn forego; When will thy breast an equal passion know? Storms cease to bluster, and the seas to roar; Even raging tempests give their fury o'er: Would heav'n you too were mutable as these, And could be soften'd like relenting seas; But deaf, as rocks beat by the sounding main, You frown unmov'd, regardless of my pain. Ye conscious echoes! vocal through the dale, To Delia loud proclaim my mournful tale: On all your wings, ye fanning zephyrs, bear, And breathe my sorrows round the cruel fair: Her virgin pride my tender verse shall move, And soft compassion touch her soul with love. Ah hapless swain! thy Delia is not kind, But stern and ruthless as the winter wind, She Colin and his profer'd love disdains, And Colin vainly to the rocks complains. No sigh nor tear her killing scorn disarms, She claims thy life the victim of her charms. I go! I go! compell'd by proud disdain; Kind death is near to rid me of my pain: Where o'er the flood projects the rocky steep, And hoarse below is roll'd the grumbling deep; From its proud height my wretched weight I'll throw, And rest in death from love's tormenting wo. Adieu my flocks! adieu ye groves and plains! Now cease ye woods, no more resound my strains. PASTORAL SECOND. Inscribed to John Home, Esq; Author of the celebrated Tragedy of Douglas, And other Dramatic Works. Hic gelidi fontes, hic mollia prata Lycori, Hic nemus, hic ipso tecum consumerer ævo.— Damon and Hylas. Now Sol the skies with purple light array'd, The glories of his western throne display'd. Where the clear stream, with verdant alder crown'd, Flows gently murm'ring o'er the channel'd ground: While all is flush'd by the departing ray, Damon and Hylas fram'd the rural lay; Young Damon o'er the perjur'd Chloris mourn'd, And Hylas for his absent Delia burn'd. Soft as they sung, the sighing groves complain, The sorrowing flocks, attentive, heard the strain; With pity mov'd, the silver swans deplore, And taught the theme to all the list'ning shore; The list'ning shore to every verse reply'd, And zephyr o'er the bending osiers sigh'd. O thou! whom Phœbus and the Nine inspire, With pow'rful art to strike the sounding lyre, To rouse the British youth to war's alarms, To fire each patriot breast with glory's charms, To call forth virtue by the magic sound, From crouds attentive, and consenting round; Accept, O Home! and let this myrtle twine Around thy garland, woven by the Nine: This humble shrub would some protection claim Among thy laurels, rising into fame. Damon. Ye sylvan pow'rs! ye genii of the grove! Ye echoes! vocal with my tale of love: Ye meads! adorn'd with flow'rs of golden hue, That fill their cups with tears of evening dew! Ye mourning woods! ye weeping fountains! join Sighs with my sighs, and shed your tears with mine; Of Chloris, perjur'd, loudly I complain; Hear, and assist this last, my dying strain. No more the days on golden wings shall rise, While bounteous nature paints the vernal skies; For me no joys shall purple autumn bring, Nor winter conquest at the village ring: The verdant mountain, and the flow'ry field, The shepherd's charge, no more delight shall yield; With Chloris nature did her charms display, With her they flourish'd, and with her decay: For her well pleas'd I join'd the rural throng, The shepherd's fortune, and the shepherd's song; By her forsaken, these delight no more, Nor plains, nor mountains, nor the breezy shore: While well known scenes and conscious groves I view, My passion rages, and my griefs renew. Say, hapless youths! who love's disaster prove, How great the anguish sprung from slighted love. Chloris! I waste beneath thy proud disdain; Resound, ye woods, resound my dying strain. Here where the green walks lead to op'ning glades, Cool'd by soft fountains and embow'ring shades; Here, hand in hand, with Chloris have I stray'd, Chloris then faithful to the vows she made; Here on the sunny bank, where fairest grows The golden king-cup and the blushing rose, I gather'd ev'ry flow'r that seem'd most fair, And deck'd the garland for her beauteous hair: Each morn her favour with fresh gifts I sought, And downy chesnuts from my hamlet brought. Ah! now these careless joyful days are gone, Chloris is fled, and I am left alone; Chloris the shepherd and his gifts disdains, Resound ye woods! resound my dying strains. Where the tall poplar speads its branching shade, On the fair rind I carv'd the vows she made: Ev'n then I clasp'd her in my circling arms, And glow'd enamour'd with deceitful charms; Her faith she pledg'd, invok'd the gods above, And call'd on all the mighty pow'rs of love. She swore and said, when Chloris perjur'd proves, Vultures shall fly before the fearless doves; O'er the mid land shall boiling ocean roar, And waving harvests turn to sandy shore; On barren oaks shall golden apples grow, And rivers backward to their fountains flow. Flow back, ye streams! and seek your springs again; Arise ye floods! and overwhelm the plain; Chloris is false: no more the dove shall fear, Nor barren oaks their fruitless branches rear. Ye powers! that over love mysterious reign! To you I come, nor let me plead in vain: For you at midnight shall my incense rise With all the pomp of magic sacrifice; Cypress shall wave your flaming altars round; With lonely weed each image shall be crown'd; By moon-light I will cut the unripen'd ear, And mournful yew, and deadly night-shade bear; Libations dire your list'ning pow'r shall move, I'll drink the potion, and forget to love; While witness to your rites, the silver moon, Eclipsing oft, shall look with pity down. I rave! I rave! what charms successful prove Against the shafts of all-subduing love! Chloris still in my inmost bosom reigns, Fills every thought, and burns through all my veins: With slow dissolving anguish I consume, And life is only but a joyless gloom; Soon will its care and adverse frown be o'er, Damon at rest, and Chloris lov'd no more; Damon to silent dreary shades shall go, Where luckless lovers rest from human wo. Farewel, ye flocks! adieu, ye groves and plains! Now cease, ye woods, no more resound my strains. Next Hylas sung, while, from the hawthorn spray, The nightingale pursu'd her am'rous lay. Hylas. Begin, my muse, the soft Sicilian strain, Sicilian muses haunt the flow'ry plain. Now the cool evening sheds its purple ray, And dewy night succeeds the scorching day; From new shorn meads the dusty swains retreat, The weary reaper seeks his humble seat; Beneath the shade the jovial lab'rers rest, And every swain is with his Sylvia blest. Where now, Oh! where can charming Delia stray, While love's soft fires upon her Hylas prey. Begin, my muse! the soft Sicilian strain; Such am'rous lays a mighty charm contain. While Orpheus sung, he sooth'd the shades below, And Hell consenting, mourn'd the poet's wo: Th'ambitious youth Timotheus could inspire With love at once, and check the rising fire: With song the Syrens rul'd the lawless main, And mighty warriors bound in magic chain: By song I try my Delia's heart to move, And numbers shall recal my absent love. Hark! from the spreading oak's aerial boughs, His ling'ring mate the am'rous ring-dove woos: From yonder beech, th'impatient turtle sighs, And see, her lover at the signal flies: Forlorn, unpity'd, and unheard, I mourn; 'Tis night, yet Delia deigns not to return. Begin, my muse! the soft Sicilian strain; Come, Delia, come, and bless thy faithful swain! As Phœbus sunk, the yellow sunflower mourns, Shuts up its leaves, and droops till he returns; As, without genial heat, the tender vines Decay, and ev'ry with'ring flow'ret pines: So, far from Delia, love's dissolving flame, And fruitless sighs, destroy my sinking frame. Absent from thee, what object can delight, The flocks displease, and sunshine turns to night; The woodbine shade its balmy sweets denies, The drooping lily hangs its head and dies; Th'industrious bees neglect their flow'ry toil; Come, Delia! come, and all around will smile. Begin, my muse! the soft Sicilian lay, My song, ye floods, to Delia's ear convey. Perhaps ev'n now, amid your crystal waves, Her snowy sides the naked wanton laves; Breath soft, ye zephyrs! round the gentle fair, Ye river nymphs! employ your friendly care, May no rough touch her tender limbs molest, Nor rougher wave insult her snowy breast: But Delia haste! thy simple vestures seize, Nor give thy beauties to the ruder breeze; Come, Delia! come! and let my longing arms Infold thee, glowing with disorder'd charms. But whence the fields this sudden verdure wear, And o'er the plain resounding shouts I hear, Soft am'rous whispers die along the shore, And, ere he sets, gay Phœbus smiles once more. 'Tis Delia, Delia, ye immortal pow'rs! Delia consents to bless the silent hours: Cease then, ye gentle muses! to complain, No more resound the soft Sicilian strain. Thus sung the shepherds at the close of day, The sky still blushing with the ev'ning ray: Safe in the fold they lodge their fleecy care, And, warn'd by Hesper, to their home repair. PASTORAL THIRD.

Non me carminibus vincet, nec Thracius Orpheus, Nec Linus. ? Colinet and Palemon. How gay the season in its pride appears! Each rural scene autumnal honours wears.

In young-ey'd beauty virtue bright'ning glows, As angel pity weeps o'er human woes, And Scotia's blooming maids, by Yarrow's stream, Sing to their plaintive lyres the fav'rite theme. The bleating flocks on their soft fleeces lie; From pasture hills the lowing herds reply: The yellow harvests whiten all the plain With Ceres' stores, to glad the happy swain: The orchards burnish, where ripe apples grow, And plumb and peach their fragrant tribute shew. Adown the vale, all on the margin green Of pastoral Tweed, the rural tribes are seen At pastime, as the jocund rebecks sound, How fleet their twinkling footsteps beat the ground: And sportive Marian, with eyes sidelong glance Of powerful magic, through the mazy dance, Conducts the charm'd Alexis, every pow'r Of love, attractive, in their blessful hour. Ye princely Throng, who grace Tweed's verdant plain, Who bless the hamlets of the rural swain, Nor coy disdain to make their fortune grow, Who swell your state, and cause the tide to flow Back to its native ocean: shield the muse! Oh! lend the refuge which the proud refuse! The forest oak the lowly shrub secures, The lowly shrub with mantling growth embow'rs His regal strength. The silver larix hides The shadow'd stream, and branches by its sides. Descend! revisiting your prosp'rous swains, To bless their pastimes and their rural strains. Colinet. Thrice blissful plain, where Tweed's sweet currents stray, Where past'ral muses on thy margin play, And shepherd-swains do shear their bleating sheep On Lammermuir, or snowy Cheviot steep: Where nymphs so fair haunt thy Arcadian stream, Like Galatea, whose fresh beauties beam Pure as the season, as she drives her flock, New wash'd, to bask beneath Sicilian rock, Still stain'd by Acis's blood. Oh! when shall I With you, kind mates! in these green pastures lie: When shall I leave Ore's barren, joyless shore, Where wrongs and poverty my days devour, Amid a barb'rous throng: my sheep consume By rot, and mildew blasts the vernal bloom, And Ceres' better hope. When shall I stray Down Leaderhaughs with you the live-long day; Or visit Gallashiels and Cowdenknows, Where first on shepherd's flute my infant muse Incondite verses sung. To pass my days With you I long, and bind my brows with bays, When ever absent from this tyrant shore, Nor pains, nor wrongs, nor loss I shall deplore. Palemon. Soft are thy numbers, Colinet, and bring Sweet sadness, as when birds of ev'ning sing. The lot of man is trouble; we increase This nat'ral evil by unhappiness. But smooth thy brow; our past'ral Sov'reign, She Who smiles on all, may ray her smiles on thee With grace benevolent. On barren heath I fed my pining flocks: by her bequeath, Transplanted to those southern vales, I grew In branching honours, like the poplar bough. Oh! had you seen the Noble Pair, as late Amid the hamlets at their yearly treat: The swains, with garlands crown'd, all em'lous seen, Low hail their pastoral Lord and pastoral Queen: How fairer than Pomona by his side She smil'd a rural, blooming, past'ral Bride. Like Cynthia on Eurota's flow'ry strand, Begirt with nymphs, her lovely huntress band Of Daughters bright, on whom the Parent smil'd In extacy, as when fresh beams begil'd Sweet break of morn: around the shepherds threw Fresh wreaths of ev'ry fragrance, ev'ry hue; While hand in hand, encircling in the dance The Noble Pair, their twinkling footsteps glance. Young Mico sweep'd the sprightly lyre, the strains Of old Dametas rouse the list'ning swains: Tho' fourscore summers crown'd his silver'd age, Yet joys of youth this wond'rous man engage: He danc'd around his past'ral Queen, and play'd The songs of Tweed, till summer's day decay'd. And had you seen that day when all the land Triumph'd, and all was pastime, you should stand A convert to our happiness, which flows From this chief fountain that our Queen bestows! Her cares thro' all the hamlets; nor will deem The time mispent as in Arcadian dream. Whate'er the proud, the selfish churl may boast, Her cares are ever pleasing, never crost: She sees her children in her vassals share The blessings she rejoices to prepare; As chosen Delegate, and pleas'd dispense, The smiles of Heav'n and Heav'nly providence. Colinet. Oh! when shall such great sentiments be read In others breasts, the little tyrant dread; Nor plague, nor barren Ceres, save what yields The hamlets loss of flocks, and herds, and fields. Their only care is adverse to the swain, To rack his rent, and raise his toils as vain: Nor reck they how their opulence does grow, Of proud estate from plunder'd swains brought low. How when the plague of Heaven thins the fold, And blasts their fields, the just remit their gold; Nor madly crave, what, in disast'rous hour, Descending floods and merc'less storms devour. Infernal avarice! with fiends combin'd, Demons of wrath, to desolate mankind! Palemon. Thrice happy swains, who feel their bliss complete, When such indulgence in such patrons meet. Fierce storms may howl, the snowy tempests rave, The roaring floods descend, but ne'er bereave The shelter'd shepherds, who full joyous sing, Safe from all storms, beneath their Sov'reign's wing. Nor let us, simple swains, whose thoughts are rude, Of men and manners, of all things conclude, From climes and customs. Nature ever flows To that prime fountain, whence her succour grows. Hail, golden age! when modern crimes unknown, The hamlets stood by innocence alone. No tyrants threaten'd, and no scoundrel train Of prouling tacksmen, to devour the swain: When mother earth, by her own children plough'd, Who plough'd the seas, to settle, not to croud The world with rapine, did, with grateful smile, Invite their labour, and return their toil With usury. When the accursed love Of gems, and Tyrian robes, and wealth, which move The world to crimes, was not yet known, nor ore Dug to betray, much better in the store Of Mammon hid, ten thousand fathom deep, Than amongst men, such bloody conflicts keep. When these usurp'd no rule, and worth rever'd Sole for herself, became her own reward. Oh, golden age! shall never man behold These Eden scenes of paradise unfold: And truth prevail, richer, than golden store, Or gems, or pearl, or mines of precious ore. Colinet. Then thy fair winding flood should copious flow In purest streams, sweet Tweed! and myrtles grow To shade thy cooling tides from summer's ray; Each fragrant shrub on thy rich banks display Sabean odours, like the groves which weep Sweet gums of Po, or Tagus' golden deep: While down thy shores Caister's silver throng, To princely bow'rs, repeat melodious song. Then heroes, princes, and descending gods Again shall grace our plains and bless'd abodes; Again the goddess, whose retreat we mourn, Astræa, to forsaken climes, return: And princely shepherds in our peaceful Dell, Again descend, with Tweed's glad swains to dwell. Fair was Adonis, the prime Cyprian swain, Belov'd of Venus, but belov'd in vain. Of am'rous nymphs, and am'rous wiles, no care Had he, but to the woodlands would repair, To rouse the chace, or drive his num'rous sheep To Idas' pastures, or Cytheron steep. Blyth of his gamesome prime, unbroke, and coy, Fair Venus lov'd, and gain'd the lovely boy: Nor yet her arts his coy reserve could tame; Oft for his flock he left the Cyprian dame: He led his flock, fair as the spotless snow Of Thracian Rhodope, nor fear'd to go Down the deep forests with his deadly bow. Till woful gash'd, as in his Cyrnean den He rous'd the angry savage, with his men, And staunch Molossian dogs; the mournful croud Lay out this shrivel'd flow'r where Venus stood; More lovely in her tears and grief, she cry'd, “Ah! what avails my plaint, to kings ally'd, “The prince of shepherds, and Cytheron's pride. “So young, so lovely, in thy manhood's prime, “Torn by a savage in thy native clime. “The joyless plains with me shall ever mourn; “The conscious day, the month, the year return “With signs of cruel fate: from native rocks, “Whence sweet Adonis led his bleating flocks, “Wat'ring these plains, a fountain fresh shall flow, “Yearly distain'd with bloody signs of wo: “Each bord'ring flow'r the mark of sorrow wears, “And Venus still shall swell the brook with tears. “Ah! wretched Venus! cruel fates bequeath “This shrivel'd flow'r, Adonis, cold in death. “Ah fairest flow'r! despoil'd of all thy charms, “He lyes unconscius in a goddess arms.” Palemon. The beauteous Atalanta, with her train Of female hunters, grac'd th'Arcadian plain; And in the rural hamlets hid, consumes Her virgin prime, amid the op'ning blooms. Sworn of bright Cynthia's band, she bears the bow, And golden buskins on her ankles glow: Health arms her limbs with strength, and pride with scorn Distain'd her cheek; she wakes with hound and horn The crimson'd dawn, nor mountain savage fears, Nor fiercest lions, till soft love appears In shepherd Hypomene. Then fades her eye: Her huntress courage leaves the nymph to sigh In lonely bow'r: her darts neglected lie: Once dread of many a tusky boar, who fell Transfix'd in the deep woods, or winding dale Of fam'd Laconia. Now he warmly woos: The maiden huntress flies, and he pursues, Fir'd by her charms: till, as she reach'd the heights Of snowy Hæmus, in her modest flights, Where could a hapless virgin fly? He threw The golden lure of Venus in her view; And as she stoop'd to grasp the envy'd prize, He seiz'd the richest treasures by surprise. 'Mid nuptial bow'rs young Hymen's torch convey'd The willing bride, who fled a tim'rous maid. The vales rejoice, as o'er Eurota's plain The blissful lovers sway with ample reign. Colinet. By Esca's flood the lion Scot upheld Fam'd Scotia's cross, in many a bloody field; Her native guard upon the bold frontiers, He brav'd the mighty in the strife of spears. Twice twenty chiefs of Egbert at his board, A menial train, attend their victor Lord. A bevy fair, to serve a Baron's state, As many blooming captive dames await, Tending domestic cares: the swains secure, Within strong forts, defy each hostile pow'r, With num'rous flocks and herds: the flying host, Innur'd to conquest, scour the ocean's coast; Fell dread of foes; and guard the holy fires, Where bright Melrosia wakes her virgin quires In sacrifice, and pure oraisons paid To heav'nly Pow'rs, their shelt'ring wings to spread, And save her country from the stranger band Of Pagan spoilers, who lay waste the land. Like the fair lilly of the vale she grew In the sweet prime of youth; her beauty drew Young Caledon, ensnar'd by virgin wile, Of looks and eyes, which could the Brave beguile. The flow'ry spring show'd fairer, the bright eye Of summer sparkl'd; the ripe blushing dye Of autumn painted rapture, as the Maid With Caledon, adown sweet Tiviot stray'd, List'ning his tale of love. With early spring, Shedding sweet flow'rets from his purple wing, Blyth Hymen came, with mask and courtly guise, To reallumne at blaze of radiant eyes His mystic torch. Anon the loud alarms Of dire invasion, call the Brave to arms. Bold like the brindl'd lion o'er his prey Rose Caledon, and mark'd his horrid way, With blood and death: the vaunting pagan band, He bound, or stretched them on the crimson sand; Returning victor in their ships to hail Northumbria's kindred tow'rs fierce storms assail With ruffian broil: Alas! 'mid raging waves, The Flow'r of Scotland sink in wat'ry graves. And, oh! Melrosia! who shall comfort thee! The Prince, thy Bridegroom, tomb'd in wint'ry sea. Nine moons the raving Princess o'er the shores Demands his mangl'd corse: nine moons deplores, The chearful light shut out, in darksome cell, Where wailing melancholy loves to dwell. At last, by pitying Heav'n restor'd, with train Of noble Maids, she seeks Tweed's blissful plain, The haunt of her belov'd. There loves to dwell, 'Mid groves and streams, and with his passing bell, To wake her Vestal Choirs; and morn and eve To usher with oraisons for the Brave; Imploring Heav'n thro' all these holy bow'rs, To shield her people from the Pagan pow'rs. Tweed's echoing shores her holy hymns repeat, And holy Angels guard her pure retreat: Each village maid, and shepherd of the dell, At evening hear Melrosia's silver bell; And white rob'd Seraphs, choiring in the air Till dawn of morn, lament the Sainted Pair. Each cornice, freeze, and architrave bewray, The mimic labours cunning hands pourtray; The blooming Maids who Jed and Tiviot grace, In snowy viels the rich Mosaic trace: And peerless Nymphs, from Fortha's winding shore, In silk Melrosia's gordian knots explore; Whose fame for faith, and love unchang'd, shall grow, While forests shade us, or pure fountains flow. Adieu chaste Naid of the streams! thy tale Our nymphs and swains shall learn in ev'ry vale: Their sweetest flow'rs, the Sisters never cease To strew, where Faith with Valo'r sleeps in peace. Palemon. The Prince of Shepherds, who on Sion's hill, Nor scorn'd to feed his flock, nor to instill His wholesome doctrine, he will often take As Pilot of this Galilean lake, This world's gulph, his lecture from the page Of sacred lore, our proud hearts to engage By winning smiles of grace and truth, so pure Of ought to earth ally'd; th'inchanting lure, Must gain all hearts, to hear the Shepherd sing, On simple reed, the songs of Sion's King, By angel choirs re-echo'd. Touch'd with fire, Indocile, rustic, rude on mystic lyre, When shall my closed lips be op'd to sing The loves of Solima and Sion's King. Colinet. I see these better days the fates dispense, To sing of Grace and mystic Providence; When impious Pride and Falsehood's group no more Unload their poisons on this world's shore. Mean time, while hope reposes, let us raise A verdant altar to the Prince of Peace; Who once a Hebrew Swain resigned to save His princely life, his vassals from the grave. No bleeding lambs nor sheep shall ever soil The holy oracle, nor herds defile, But purest sacrifice of grateful praise, Faith, Holiness, and Love, shall ever blaze In hecatombs, to Him who left the sky, Who taught and bled that man might never die. He breath'd his spirit in his friends, and said, “Follow the harmless shepherd's peaceful trade; “Protect your lambkins from the rout which prey “With rav'nous range, way-lurking to betray “Unguarded folds. Oh! watch the prouling croud “Of lawless man, oppressive, false, and proud. “Let Shepherd Boys, who tend with nightly guard “Of mastive watch, obtain their meet reward. “Be never niggard of your stores, nor lead “By base example to unrighteous deed. “Encourage modest Merit: tyrant crimes “Invade all right, in these corrupted times. “Brave prosp'rous guilt, nor sink the poor man's scale, “When falsehood, malice, pow'r, and pride prevail. “Avenge their Cause: nor, impious, thou! refuse “Their much deserted int'rests to espouse, “'Gainst traitors false: They are the Mystic Spouse. “The gen'rous mind makes ev'ry burden light “Unto the Poor, nor robs them of their Right. “Godlike dispense the blessings Heav'n bestows “Freely on all: The lamp of day, which glows “With purest fire, is emblem that our light “Should shine, and drive these shadows of the night.” Palemon. Arise, fond swain! to sing, and not to preach, Is here an office, and within your reach. The gentlest Critics mildly will reprove Our motely tales of shepherds, heroes, love. Arise! the storm, from Cheviot mountains rare, And piercing, blows: The lambkins faintly bear The drizzling show'r; behind this grove to-night We rest: to pastures green with morning light. PASTORAL FOURTH. Most humbly inscribed to the Right Honourable the Lady Frances Douglas. Extinctam nymphæ crudeli funere Daphnen Flebant. ? Colinet, Palemon. Sweet is the ev'ning hour, the blushing west, From crimson cloud, invites the flocks to rest: The star of eve, as to his dome he glides, With streamy splendor, gilds the mountain sides: The moon serene, in glory to her sphere Ascends: the stars faint twinkling disappear: All nature rests: the vulture's lazy flight Imposes silence on the ear of night. Now, Colinet, renew the mournful song, Which gain'd the prize amid our shepherd throng: Our stated hour is come, at Douglas' grave, To mourn with dirges due, and garlands weave; To strew the latest flow'rs the season yields, Their yearly tribute from consenting fields: Sing, while beside the shaded tomb I mourn, And plaintive verses with meet rites return. And thou, bright Dame! by ties of nature join'd, And stronger love's in sympathy combin'd, Who ever hears, or sadly seems to hear, The suff'ring Fair One, in a Daughter's ear, Repeat her tales of sorrow, while the moon Eclipsing seems to stoop with pity down; Accept, thrice princely Douglas! what you chuse, Your fav'rite eclogue, when the past'ral muse Her select songs presented at the shrine Of fairest Candor, whose sweet graces join To shield th'Immortal Sisters: They who move Th'impassion'd soul with pity and with love, Or sacred grief, whose streaming sorrows flow, With angel tears, conjoin'd o'er human wo. So while, sweet winding Tweed! thy swelling streams, With purest wave, divide two sister realms, Sicilian muses, to thy list'ning swains, On Doric reed, shall sing Arcadian strains. Thy wand'ring tides, amid the noble throng, Who haunt thy shores, repeat the shepherds song: Nor they disdain in Langholm's bowr's to hear The verse which charm'd fair Douglas' classic ear. So shall the baleful harpy tribe deplore The golden crown they sacraligious tore: And pallid Envy's strife be ever laid, While lawrel wreaths my barren temples shade. Colinet. Ye tuneful Sisters! Leave your silver springs Of Tweed, and listen while your Shepherd sings: Come from your wat'ry bow'rs and grottos deep, Sweet wells of sadness, which for ever weep: In sacred sympathy conjoin'd, bestow Your angel tears on female worth laid low. And ye sad Swains your murm'ring fountains hide With branching cypress o'er the shaded tide. Exchange gay garlands for funereal flow'rs, And mourn for Douglas in dismantl'd bow'rs: Hang sable pansies, bell-flow'rs, round her grave, And dirges sing; this dying charge She gave. Ye little Loves bestow the streaming tear, As when you weep'd Adonis on his bier; His lovely limbs gash'd by the Cyprian boar, His snowy limbs distain'd in dust and gore. Belov'd by Venus, but belov'd in vain, He bleeds extended on the crimson'd plain. Here with your golden darts, now useless grow'n, Inscribe a verse on the relenting stone. Douglas! the pride of Scotia's dames, deplore, Douglas! our glory and our boast, no more; Here shrowded in the tomb, and clay cold lies, While we lament with unavailing sighs: And ev'ry shepherd leaves his flocks, to pay His mournful tribute to the Noblest Clay. Let nature change, let all the world deplore, Douglas! our glory and our boast, no more! 'Tis done, and see, the deep funereal gloom O'ercasts all nature, and proclaims our doom. With gelid pearls the shrevil'd forests rear Their arms, their honours scatter'd on Her bier. Lo! where on earth the flow'ry tribes consume The breath of nature, and her endless bloom: With Her they flourish'd, and with her consign Their silken hues in sorrow to repine. Ah! what are nature's various charms she wore, Douglas lies cold in death, and charms no more! For Her the sorrowing flocks refuse to feed, The thirsty herds abhore the wat'ry mead, The silver swans by fam'd Caister's shore Her piteous death in mournful plaints deplore; As to their flow'ry margins they retire From vultures sang, and in sweet notes expire. In deep recess coy Echo silent lies, Forgets her fate and sad Narcissus' sighs, Belov'd to madness: Ah! with piteous look, The scornful boy devour'd the chrystal brook In love's strong magic fix'd: a woful prey The Nymphs Despiser sunk, and pin'd away By melting love: now in Elysian grove He joins sweet Echo, and returns her love: Where amaranthine flow'rs the Pair adorn On beds of roses sunk without a thorn. The gen'rous Nymph the lovelorn maiden hears, Repeats her sighs, and answers tears with tears. Fair Douglas' fate with weeping train she mourns In grot and bow'r, and meet lament returns: Her name with pleasure once she taught the shore, Douglas lies cold in death, and charms no more! And oh! sad Sisters! of the sacred spring, Who deck Her shrine, Her dying mandates sing. When on the bed of death the Parent lay, To the stern grizzly king a hapless prey; And her sweet Boy embrac'd, to heaven she pray'd, With trembling hands on her young Douglas laid, And mother's pleading eyes: “Just God! she cry'd, “Great God! I bless you for his manly pride. “Of comfort reft, in want, in death undone “By false reproach, I glory in my Son “And heav'n's Redemption; which now nigh the goal “Of a rough race, sustains my fainting Soul. “Mercy absolves: from scenes of deep'ning wo, “My sacrifice of praise shall purer flow, “With radient Choirs, before the sapphire throne, “Where Mercy pleads with Justice for my Son; “Completing ev'ry hope: while here below “A mother sees her branch of Douglas grow “Amid connubial Virtues; the Prime Train “Of Princely Friendships stretch their golden chain. “Nor wealth nor grandeur I on Thee confer, “Tho' born both wealth and grandeur high to share: “The Father of the fatherless approve “Thy course to Virtue and thy Country's love. “Humble the proud, who may thy worth deride, “And fire thy soul to deeds of honest pride. “Born to be Great, aspire to raise thy Name, “Tread in each Kindred Heroes steps to fame. “The sword of Douglas in the battle wield, “The Pride of peace, in war, a nation's Shield: “For this gay vice and empty pomp disdain, “But deck with Truth, abhoring Falsehood's stain. “Pow'r without Worth and high Descent deride, “And pageant Coronets, the vain man's pride: “Woo Justice, Truth, and gracious Heav'n shall raise “Some noble Mind to bless thy prosp'rous days: “To right the Orphan, lift thy scale on high, “To shine with glory, while these shadows fly.’ Her speech the chilly hand of death supprest, And smiling on her Son She sunk to rest On angels wings in mansions of the bright, Laving her grief's sad wound in rivers of delight. Much injur'd Shade! Oh! could this verse avail, I'd fill the world with thy too rigid tale; That brightest Eyes should weep o'er thy sad fate, And Fame to distant climes thy Wrongs relate; That all the Good, and all the Just should come, And all ye Fair! to weep at Douglas' tomb: Sad pilgrims yearly to console Her shade With oraisons and carols for the Dead. What tho' no pillar'd arch adorn the place With scutcheon'd state, nor sculptur'd marble grace Thy humble cell; each mournful Muse shall weep, And tune their lyres unto thy sorrows deep. What tho' vile sacrilege with base combine, Of all its honours robb'd thine injur'd Shrine: The Just shall honour Thee thro' all the land, Thy spotless fame eternal wreathes command. While staring ghosts, and yelling demons wait On ruthless villainy, entomb'd in state: Good Genii here their nightly station keep, Where Truth and Innocence serenely sleep. Bright Peace, with Olive Crown and Angels blest, Shall guard the tomb where Douglas' relicts rest. Pity, sweet pilgrim, visit thy sad cell, And fond Remembrance ring thy solemn knell. And ev'ry spring from grot and sylvan bow'rs, The wood Nymphs fair shall strew thy grave with flow'rs; With snow drop, primrose, each sweet smelling hue, And still with annual rites their pleasing task renew. Palemon. Sweet tuneful Colinet, the strains you sing, As is the music of the murm'ring spring. Sweet are soft slumbers on the verdant plain, Sweet cooling fountains to the thirsty swain, Sweet gentle sunshine, or descending show'rs, To fervent bees, or to the drooping flow'rs; Yet fountains, slumbers, sunshine to the bee, Not half so pleasing, as these strains to me. Colinet. To Thee bright Goddess, now our grief no more, Lambkins shall bleed, if Heav'n increase our store, While forests shade us, flow'rs their sweets bestow, Thy Name, thy Honour, and thy Praise shall grow! See! moist Arcturus sheds unwholesome dews, Arise, the groves a noxious shade diffuse: Chill Eurus blows, and Nature feels distress, Time conquers all, and we must time redress. Adieu ye shepherds-loves, ye mountains, streams, Adieu ye lovelorn shepherds rural themes, Adieu Fair, Peerless, Prime Arcadian crew, Douglas, farewell! sweet Banks of Tweed, adieu! [Occasional Poems] EPITHALAMIUM ON THE MARRIAGES OF His Grace JOHN Duke of Athole, Right Hon. DAVID Viscount Stormont, AND THOMAS GRAHAM of Balgowan, Esq; WITH THE Three Most Amiable Daughters OF The Right Hon. CHARLES Lord Cathcart. CANTO I. Sponsalia cantabit Musa: Di cœpta secundent Fœdera! et æterno connectat pectora nexu Intemerata fides; ter nobili sanguine surgant, Qui terris dent jura væstris! securaque præstent Imperia, et lapsis norint succurrere rebus. Deep in the foaming brine, where Ocean laves Fam'd Albion's isle, with ever-toiling waves, With gems and pearl the radiant palace stands, Chrystalline frame, where Amphitrite commands. Their orgies here, the Sisters of the deep, Seven festive days in annual splendor keep; What time Hyperion from the southern goal His chariot wheels, to warm the freezing pole. With feast and song the sea-green Nymphs combine, In full libations pour the sparkling wine, In mystic dance their silver tridents rear In homage to the regent of the sphere. First Thetis to the sacred feast is borne In em'rald car, which antique gems adorn, And sculptur'd gold, where blazon'd bright is seen The lineage high of Ocean's ancient Queen. Proud, by her side, her eldest offspring came, The Thracian Doris, Nereus' blooming dame, Whose fifty Daughters follow'd o'er the tide, Her maidens fair, their parents vaunted pride. Eucrate, mild as spring, with garlands gay; Cymodoce, who raging seas can stay; Chaste Galatea, whose fresh beauties beam In Acis bath'd her sweet Sicilian stream: Erato prime, with love's black tresses crown'd; Young Psamathe, for snowy breasts renown'd; Cymothe fleet, whose steps the waves beguile; And Glauce charming, with resistless smile; With all their sister tribe, in jovial mood, Laving their snowy limbs in briny flood. In order next came Neptune's blooming train, Fam'd Albion's Daughters, each in coral wain: First stately Forth, with many a crowding sail, And winding tides, enamour'd of the vale, Choice Ceres' haunt, renoun'd in Bruce's reign, When English Edward mourn'd his myriads slain. Her beauteous nymphs, in silver veils bedight, Glide thro' the deeps, like heavenly graces bright, Three princely crowns, their tribute meet, they bore, With sparkling pearl from the Indian shore: And all the way they sung a Nuptial Song For Cathcart's Brides, to whom sweet strains belong. “Fair rise the new-born year! like blushing rose, “To Hymen's shrine the lovely Cathcart goes.” From silver lakes, which bathe her verdant isles, Came branching Taia, with Hesperian spoils, Whose hundred streams, obsequious urge their way To hail true lovers on their bridal day; Proud of their noble race, whose peerless worth, Wooing the lovely daughters of the Forth, In league of amity, each sister tide Conjoins; together, o'er the waves they ride. Then wealthy Clyde, who loyal tribute bore, Of choicest nectar, from the Indian shore; Whose fost'ring Stream the Muses Choirs adorn, And wealthy Commerce set on western Throne. Heard ye their Strains See Mr Richardson's elegant poem.! as up the stately wave, The refluent river march'd with pride, to lave In eastern Forth, whose flow'ry vales along Melodious waft the Shepherd's nuptial song. From pleasing dales sweet Tweed, once doom'd to glide 'Twixt hostile realms, now crown'd with rural pride, Where many a Castle fair hangs o'er the wave, And many a Baron bold, with warriors brave Repell'd invasion: now in purer tide Her lovely Daughers bathe their beauty's pride. Or in the shades of Tiviot, Parent Stream! Or silvan Jed, as in Arcadian dream, Lead on the dance; or urge, in jocund throng, The circling chace, these rural scenes among. And Devon's Nymph, who laves with wa'try store Her silver mass, presents the shining ore: Nor longer jealous, hides her rich supplies, Since princely Jason bears her golden prize. The swelling Spey, and Varar's far-fam'd flood, With northern Naids yeild their scaly brood; And Deva's stream, fost'ring her learned Quire, Charm'd with the magic of the Minstrel's lyre. Next came the Nymphs from many a courtly bow'r, Where Lordly Thamis' swelling waters pour; Or stormy Humber, with the chaste Sabrine Commix their sparkling sands with diamond sheen: Or subterranean mines, where Tina flows, And Commerce rich from sable mass bestows. The King of Floods high tow'rs above the rest, Augusta's image top'd his ruby crest: Consign'd by fate, a triple crown he bore, And trident, ensign of imperial pow'r. Pride grac'd his brow, and conscious honour high, And loyal zeal, and freedom's fearless eye; Three gorgeous robes enrich'd with gold he brought His artists frame with lively figures wrought. Last came the peerless Daughter of the sea, Th'imperial Queen whom gods and men obey, Celestial Venus: splendent from afar, With purple radiance blaz'd her diamond car; Her car the doves with silver plumage drew, Around her train on golden pennons flew; These to the winds her floating crimson spread, These o'er the waves Idalian flow'rets shed: With regal pomp, the prime of Nereus' race, She rides sublime their festival to grace. Old Ocean smooths his brow, and joys again To bear the fairest offspring of the main; His hundred floods with fond embraces join, And to the hall conduct the Charge Divine. All these, obsequious, tend the sov'reign call, To grace the feast in Amphitrite's hall. Supreme the Goddess sat on regal throne, Where pillar'd gold and diamond splendor shone. Their homage paid, this blooming bevy join O'er feast ambrosial, and nectarean wine. From orient pearl, they feast in shining rows, In em'rald cups the sparkling bev'rage flows In circling course: to grace the feast descends Prime Harmony, and magic pleasance blends. 'Mid harpings clear resounds th'Eolian lyre With melting strains; nor mute the vocal Quire; In sweet response, at every close they sung, Whilst o'er the flood these gratulations rung: “Hail, sacred Morn! thrice blest, and fairest, rise! “That leads Hyperion up the Eastern skies, “With Hymen in his train, whose genial ray “Revives the world, and drives these shades away. “Rise, sacred Morn! arise! and with thee bring “First birth of Time, the ever-blooming Spring: “With rosy pleasures in their gay career, “And joyance meet to crown the festive year.” Thus pass'd the jovial week, now twilight grey In silver-skirted cloud conducts the day, Then all in homage to the circling sky, With mystic morrice ends their jubily. On chrystal seats reclin'd in princely hall The sea-green Nymphs attend the sov'reign call, Where in rotation Amphitrite bestows On every district where her current flows The annual boon: in just succession rise The Albion Floods, and claim their rightful prize. The Pow'r consenting thus awards their claim, Yours is the boon, ye Nymphs! of mighty fame. Loyal allegiance thus fix'd Fate repays, Then tribute claim of all the sea surveys. With low obeisance and according voice 'Gan lordly Thames announce the gen'ral choice: “Hail Neptune's Queen! whose mace of dreadful pow'r “Controuls the floods, and quells the stormy stour; “Who brings Hyperion on his annual way, “Whom clouds, and winds, and wat'ry pow'rs obey; “No common boon we crave, no treasures shine, “No diamond flaming from the eastern mine, “Nor pow'rs increase to scar the world's repose, “Nor guilty wreaths from Turk or Christian foes, “Nor tribute praise; th'etherial herald dame “Awes distant climes with Albion's warlike fame: “Her native main the world's vast wealth conveys, “And crowns of conquest at her footstool lays. “This be the boon, great Amphitrite prepare, “In sovereign state, with this assemblage fair, “To join, with mystic rites, on Thame's strand, “The Noble Brides in Hymen's golden band. “Whose happy Lovers wait in nuptial weir, “The richest treasure of the new-born year. “For Athole, he who rules with princely sway, “Where branching Taia's silver currents stray, “And fertile Mona, with his mountains steep, “Their ancient realm o'erlooks the western deep; “In whose high mind prime honour builds her bow'r, “And Worth gives lustre beyond wealth or pow'r, “For Cathcart fair avows his am'rous flame, “The brightest Nymph from Fortha's winding stream. “And gallant Graham, from martial lineage sprung “Of Patriot Chiefs, by ancient poets sung, “Smit with the charms that in Maria shine, “With ardour woos, where worth and beauty join. “But who comes yonder! with a bridegroom's haste, “Like princely Phœbus from the gorgeous east! “'Tis He in foreign courts supreme to guide “Britannia's Weal, and o'er her fate preside! “Now while her mighty Genii in their sphere, “The weight of empire for their Stormont bear: “The toils of state he gilds with beauty's smile, “For Hebe could the cares of Jove beguile; “And in Louisa's bloom, with virgin grace “Of virtue, charming in so fair a face, “Proffers to virtuous love what here below “Exalted minds are only bless'd to know; “The nectar'd joys which Hymen mix'd above “For kindred souls, who mutual passion prove; “When Venus' Son, with chosen golden darts “Of passion chaste, has pierc'd two faithful hearts. “Lo here, the pride of birth and merit join'd, “Begild the branches of a noble kind, “Cathcart their Sire, from ancient peers renown'd, “With civil fame, and martial plaudit crown'd, “On whom his country looks, with hope elate, “In evil times to prop Britannia's state. “His Consort, sprung from Brandon's princely race, “Whose fame the annals of our Isle shall grace, “And circling fair in many a noble tide, “Down Albion's vale, with bounteous current glide, “Left her fair Image in her Daughter train, “Love's pledges, when she sought the heavenly plain; “Heirs of her worth: now, from the starry sky, “She marks their safety with a Parent's eye; “Like saintly guard, from shafts of mortal wo, “She shields the precious Pearls she left below. “Such their descent, and such the princely band, “Who grace with bridal pomp Thames' flow'ry strand. “With jocund troop, th'imperial Paphian Dame, “Who first inspir'd, will crown the lover's flame, “And with her bring all mystic Jollity, “Hymen and bright Autonoe's Progeny; “The Graces Three, in whom all charms combine, “Offspring of Jove, and crown'd with youth divine: “Whose winning smiles bid virtue brighter glow, “Whose honey'd breath can temper cups of wo; “Whose presence blest, enhances human joy; “Whose absence, would life's fairest scenes destroy, “Blast frolic youth, bid grandeur's plumage fade, “And regal glory shrink a ghastly shade: “For this your splendid palace we explore, “To guide your train to Thamis' festive shore. “Dread Goddess! hear, this proffer'd boon consign, “And we the wealth of Indian worlds resign.” The Pow'r replies: “Your fond petition gain, “To Thames we pass, with all this blooming train: “And now my steeds, impatient of controul, “With fiery neighings, claim the distant goal; “Aurora calls me from her rosy sphere, “And ling'ring Phospher chides, with circlet clear.” The Nereids heard, their busy march prepare, And all the Nymphs who on the billows fare, Their cars ascend; in marine state they glide O'er the blue waves, which stoop their tow'ring pride. With gorgeous troop the Goddess pass'd sublime, Who rules the swelling seas in ev'ry clime; In crystal orbs her pearly axle flew, The Tritons brave their coral trumpets blew, Her smiles the winds and murm'ring tempests fled, Her golden scepter smooth'd the Ocean's bed: Fair on her forehead beam'd the morning star, The sun's bright orbit rose beneath her car; Whose flaming glories, from th'etherial gate, Full royally disclose imperial state. All Nature shouts, the birds of every name, And howling wilds, the year's return proclaim. Air, earth, and sea, herds on a thousand hills, Till ev'ry land the general joyance fills. Aloft the Year, girt with her figur'd zone, Rode with Hyperion on his golden throne: Around the new-born Pow'rs perennial seat, Flew forms ideal, endless to relate. The winged Hours, in silver reins confin'd The flying coursers, which outstrip the wind: The crouding Days, and fleeting Months appear, With unborn ages hov'ring in the rear. With chant of merry birds, soft-breathing Spring Seem'd shedding flow'rets from her crimson wing. In loose attire the radiant Summer bound Her spicy wreaths, and roses strew'd around. Like nuptial bride, with highly blooming charms, Ripe Ceres blush'd in Autumn's circling arms. From ruffian blast, in ermine's speckled pride, Coy Winter strove her sick'ning frame to hide. These must'ring journey with the new-born year In endless circuit thro' the rolling sphere Revolving ever, till in ruins hurl'd, Expires the shining fabric of the world. CANTO II. Ter fortunate Sponsus! tibi ducitur uxor, Quæ Thalamus pietate beat, virtutibus ornat, Et stirpis claræ decus morum transfulget honore. Succrescat fœcunda Aula! agnoscat alumnos, Gaudiisque decurrant venientes molliter anni, Nec vobis alias decernant fidera tædas. Thro' the mid Ocean, fann'd with am'rous gales, Bright Amphitrite in state imperial sails. Around the Queen, in blooming Beauty's pride, The jocund bevy o'er the billows glide. They speed their voyage all the live-long day, And reach, with eve, Tamesias' ample bay. There up the wid'ning channel's wond'ring stream They wind with stately march their squadron trim, Where lordly rises, 'mid the smiling plain, The regal Seat where Albion monarchs reign, And Julian Tow'rs begild the peopl'd strand, The envy, and the dread of every land. Here Fate ordains her fav'rite Line to rule With Naval Scepter fear'd from pole to pole: To awe the proud, to set the nations free From slavish chain of grasping tyranny: While o'er the deeps, like heav'n's red fire, is hurl'd, Their thund'ring storm, to shake a guilty world. To save a downward age, now Mercy brings Th'imperial ensigns to the best of Kings; Augustus sways and decks his triple crown With justice, mildness, Grandeur's best renown, And public love. Ye fretful factions, play! Like clam'rous swarm beneath Hyperion's ray; Short is your span, the summer breezes soil Your varnish'd hues in dust, and close your idle toil. Should rebel pride our scenes of peace deform, Firm Royalty outrides the swelling storm; The Skilful Pilot tried in boist'rous seas, Guides public safety to the port of peace: Whilst grateful Nations, loyal, bold, and free, Bear down the league of factious anarchy, Blest in Augustus' love. The Albion Queen, Like Venus from the flood, with sov'reign mein, And Siren voice, charming rude winds that blow, With smiles of amity, shall kindly shew, Like Cynthia mild, or Hesper's orient beam That skirts the brow of night with silver gleam: For in her sphere She shines, with virtues rare, To soothe the Monarch's or the Peoples care. Forgive the Muse, she soars on trembling wing, 'Mid Loyal Throng, their excellence to sing; Would blend unequal voice in duteous lay T'imperial Pow'r, whom three great realms obey, And heav'n implore with pure oraisons meet, His Toils to prosper who upholds the state. Onward they pass, where Thamis' op'ning grove, Splendent afar, reveals the bow'r of love. Before the marble gate, with stedfast eye, Watch'd Constancy, who guides the orbs on high, In faithful course, bids vernal seasons glow, Or rising year, love's better gifts, bestow. Within shone faithful love, and virtue's pride, And Virgin Beauty, grac'd on either side With prime Nobility, and Honour high, And blushing Merit sweet, with downcast eye, With many a princely Dame, and gallant Peer, To grace their nuptials rob'd in gorgeous wier. And hark! the damsels sing their carols sweet, While jocund hautboy, with respondence meet, Conducts the song: “Come forth, ye Nymphs! so fair, “Bright Venus' train, your bridal crowns prepare: “Love's radiant harbinger, with golden crest, “The star of ev'ning, trembles in the west; “And, for the Bridegroom, chides the ling'ring hours, “And brings the Bride into the bridal bow'rs. “Now Hymen lights his torch in trim array, “And starry night shines lovelier than the day; “'Tis Hymen calls, attend the sacred sound, “The cares of love, with love's best joys are crown'd.” Now cease, ye damsels! cease your nuptial song! Lo! where they, brightest of the virgin throng, Whom crowns of worth and beauty prime adorn, Break from their chambers, like the blushing morn, Or Sol's chaste Sister, flush'd with purple ray, From eastern palace to eclipse the day. In glitt'ring robes array'd, and garlands green, The Brides, in semblance like some maiden Queen, Like Dian on Eurota's flow'ry strand, With shafts unerring, 'mid the huntress band: Or when Jove's Daughter calls his progeny, They shine in beauty like the Graces Three. But who is she! in virgin robes array'd, Of silver silk, as suits the noble maid, Like youthful Hebe, dazzling ev'ry eye, Adjusts their train where ambush'd Cupids ly. And now, with other throng, the hall rebounds, The bright assemblage hear celestial sounds; The warbling lute, and soft recorders clear, With clanging trumpets pierce the echoing air, Whilst from a golden cloud, with concourse bright, Unfolds the state of sov'reign Amphitrite. Great Tethys' Race, bedeck'd in em'rald sheen, The Albion Pow'rs, and love's imperial Queen, With meet oraisons greet each noble Bride, Then range their squadron gay on either side. Bright Ocean's dame, on either Bride bestows A sparkling crown, enchaced with diamond rows. Venus their cestus binds, where winning Smiles, And young Desire, and Beauty, range their wiles. The Graces, handmaids to the rival Fair, In artful ringlets spread their flowing hair: And all the concourse rang'd in brilliant row, Choice service do, fond courtesy to show; While glancing round, from many a radiant eye, Th'unerring shafts of mighty Cupid fly. Anon the Bridegroom's summons seems to say “Arise, my Turtle Dove! and come away! “Bleak Winter's gloom, with dark suspence is fled, “The dawning year now gilds his orient head; “The woodlands round your bridal carols sing, “And youthful Hymen shakes his fragrant wing: “A thousand pleasures wait in trim aray, “Arise my best Belov'd! and come away.” The Gallant Baron, with a Parent's pride Conducts, in solemn state, each Sister Bride, Where sacred priest before the altar stands, And joins the faithful Pairs in holy bands; Blending his utt'rence chaste with cordial pray'r, “May faith and truth, high heav'ns best blessings, share.” Return'd in pomp, the gay assemblage greet The nuptial train, with gratulations meet: In the bright van, the sov'reign Queen of Love, With Amphitrite, their princely favour prove: Taia and Forth, their maids, in trim array, Before their steps with flow'rets strew'd the way. On lovely Cathcart's brow, with bright renown, Irradiant Athole plac'd his ducal crown: Louisa's coronal, from the Graces' grove Stormont intwin'd with never-fading love. Graham's martial wreaths on fair Maria shine, Heroic laurel wove with myrtle twine: While Beauty's Guard, like Red-Cross Knights of old, In shining circle stand the Brothers bold. And now, in order plac'd, each smiling guest, In Princely guise proceeds the nuptial feast; The lustres blaze, the sparkling bev'rage flows, And festive joyance in each bosom glows. The Queen of Love demands the mystic song, At her command begin the virgin Throng; At her command prime Harmony descends, The muses Train their magic pleasance blends. Resounds Arion's harp, and Sirens three, Commixing charm of heav'nly minstrelsy, With trembling voice angelical, controul, And steal with ravishment the thrilling soul. They sung high mysteries of verse sublime, Where daring fancy never learn'd to climb; The loves of Vesta, crown'd in bright abodes, Espous'd by Cœlum, eldest of the Gods, From whom descends th'immortal progeny, The Gods of Hades, Ocean, Earth, and Sky. Of ancient Time, the annals of his reign They sung, 'ere Sol illumin'd the starry plain, When Chaos heard the dreadful voice, and fled, Creation struggling in her infant bed: The waters sought the deep, the fluid air Compass'd the globe, and fire the heav'nly sphere. Then life and light, and Nature's frame begun, And first to measure time the regent Sun, By whom ordain'd the hour, day, month, and year, With unborn ages, in fixed course appear. Anon, with martial strain, the halls rebound, The Tritons brave, their coral trumpets sound. They sung the terrors of the Norric sword, When furious Suen, with vent'rous sails, explor'd High Scotia's shore, across the foaming main, With host vindictive, for his kinsmen slain: They, from the burden'd deep, unloading, range Their iron freight, of armed warriors strange, With silvan spoils, and bowmen skilled to guide Their Doffrine shafts: Stalks Devastation wide, And Rape, and Death, from Bertha's martial town, To Deva's stream, and northern Caledon. With spoil and pride inflate, the barb'rous band, With tyrant rod, control'd th'indignant land, 'Till Athole, Stormont, and the gallant Graham, Their country's shield, like Northern tempest came. Fallen, with his Peers, on Taia's purple heath, The Scandian mourn'd his glory set in death; In his proud fleet the flying rout consume, The Victors whelm them in a fiery doom. Then rear each leader's tomb with lordly guise, Sad sable beacons, seen with streaming eyes, While Scandia shuns high Scotia's fatal shore, And mourns her wariors who return no more. Thus plaintive, soon to joy they strung the lyre With melting sounds, that kindle soft desire, And youthful fancy; for of Love they tell, And League of Amity, meet charm to quell Demons of war, and hatred: How the dart Of Venus' son, unerring, pierc'd the heart Of Caledon, in Beauty's blooming pride, To pine for Anna fair, his Cimbrian bride. With wealthy dow'r, of many a verdant isle, Which 'mid the blust'ring Ocean seems to smile, Whose fishy lakes, and shaggy dales, the gleam Of ling'ring Summer, greets with fost'ring beam, The Virgin came; in gilded vessel, crown'd, With gallant chiefs, and streamers, to the sound Of silver fifes: beneath the waving shade Of silken canopy, the beauteous Maid, With winning looks, and magic charm, is seen, To soothe rude winds and waves, like Egypt's Queen, When up the silver Nile her galleys move, With Anthony; nor bless'd with virtuous love. And now the Lover spies his Bride afar, In navy struggling with the wat'ry war; For, envious of their joy, with adverse storm, The sudden tempests Anna's way deform, With barb'rous rage divide whom love conjoin'd, The Princess captive by the ruffian wind, Forc'd from a Bridegroom's arms, by rapine rude, Is born on wings of tempest o'er the flood; And hardly 'scap'd, with ships half-wreck'd, explores High Lochlin's port, within the shelt'ring shores. The Prince consum'd with Venus' pleasing pain, The more the jealous elements restrain, The more he burns for his betrothed bride, And faithful follows o'er the angry tide. Her virgin grace, the light of radiant eyes, And virtue meetly shrin'd in beauteous guise, Kindle the blazing torch beheld afar, And, like Love's harbinger, the friendly star, Which drew Leander cross the rapid tide Of Thracian Bosphorus, to Hiero's bed, With grateful splendors gild his path, and keep His am'rous voyage o'er the foaming deep: The torch of Venus burns to light his way, Where Cimbrian Princess, like the blooming May, Awaits to crown his faith, each peril o'er, With love's sweet joys in Hymeneal bow'r. Then pass'd the nuptial months, in pastime bright, Of feast, and courtly mask; and many a knight Won fame and favour at the rapid course; Or, proudly mounted on his barbed horse, And kindling prowess at bright Beauty's glance, Couch'd in fierce tournament his quiv'ring lance. Each morn shook pleasance from his fragrant wings, And young-ey'd Love increasing treasure brings: Till rich in public praise, and homage due, The Royal Pair, renown'd for passion true, In pomp departed, with their princely band, And rul'd, with growing fame, their native land. The minstrels ceas'd; for now in western foam The star of evening sought his radiant dome: The Graces and young Loves, with golden wing, The Bridal Pairs into their chamber bring: The Queen of Floods, and all the marine Pow'rs, Thro' the still wave explore their wat'ry bow'rs. 'Twas silence all, in heavenly tow'rs on high, The Spheres kept watch, with ever-waking eye: Sweet on the lawn, from the etherial steep, Fond Cynthia with Endymion seem'd to sleep: When at their lattice, with sweet bird of eve, Her mate, the muse thus parting carol gave. “Farewel True Hearts, whom Hymen's sacred pow'r, “Blending the Honours of such Noble Line, “In chaste league does combine; “May heav'nly blessings on your nuptials show'r. “Be Constancy and Love your wealthy dow'r! “For Virtue, bright'ning fair, in Beauty's eyes, “Outsoaring winged Fame, and Titles proud, “That mock the idle crowd, “Is meetly crown'd with Merits golden prize. “And may the guardian Cohort of the skies, “Who hold in charge your safety to maintain, “Within the refuge of their wings embrace “Your Life and Princely Race; “And increase strengthen Hymen's golden chain. “And may high Grace conduct your Kindred Train “To share full bliss, when mortal pleasures fly, “Angelic Saints, the streams of life among, “Circling in radiant Throng, “To crown your joys of Immortality.” The mottos of the Epithalamium may be thus translated. CANTO I. Sing muse! the nuptial song: May heav'n from high, Smile on such union with propitious eye; And sacred faith, in everlasting chain Of golden concord, kindred hearts constrain. Joy gild your days: long may your noble race In Albion's isle preside, with lordly grace, Tending the public weal; our anchor'd hope, In peace, in war, their country's stable prop. CANTO II. Thrice favour'd! to receive at Hymen's shrine, What far the splendors of high birth outshine; Truth, piety, and female honour pure, Prime crown of love, bright beauty's richest dow'r. From noblest stem, may hopeful branches shoot, With blossom rip'ning into golden fruit: Your gentle fates in pleasing current flow, By heav'n conjoin'd, nor cloud nor sorrow know. THE CYRNEAN HERO. HUMBLY INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF PEMBROKE. Hail to the Chief! whom civic wreathes adorn, Whose loud acclaim from pole to pole is borne; Whose godlike strife to save a sinking land, To wrench the scourge from stern Oppression's hand, To shield the last remains, the children brave Of Freedom struggling 'mid the Tyrrhene wave; The British Youth shall mark with fond surprize, And Patriots feel their kindred passions rise; More bold to plead for their invaded laws, And grapple danger for the public cause; To quell the storm when mad'ning factions roar, Or tyrant Bourbon, from his hostile shore, Like great Paoli, 'tend their Country's call, Resolv'd on conquest, or a glorious fall. What tho' illib'ral France, with venal band, Now proudly lords it o'er thy native land! The sordid State prepare with tyrant frown And slavish yoke, to bend thy country down. What tho' fell bondage shakes her iron rod O'er Cortes' walls, glad freedom's late abode! Yet brighter days shall gild the fav'rite Isle And Fate relenting, on her warriors smile. The race of Herc'les ev'ry danger braves, Nor tamely bends to hosts of Latian slaves. The public love each kindred bosom fills, And pours her champions from a hundred hills: Feircely they rally o'er the Cyrnean The Author in this Poem uses the antient name of Corsica, which was called Cyrnum or Cyrna by the Greeks, from Cyrnus, the son of Hercules, who was supposed to have been the first who planted a colony in that island. See Stephanus de urbibus, or that curious and interesting History of Corsica, published in the year 1770, by the ingenious James Boswell, Esq; of Auchinleck. shore, And drench the island with invader's gore. Unconquer'd Cyrna, struggling to be free, Still rends the yoke of galling slavery; Renews the mortal charge with deep'ning roar, Like the wild waves which dash her rocky shore. Still Bourbon's mercenary host shall bleed; Again high Cyrna lift her laurel'd head; Again triumph in thy victorious sword, The public father to his sons restor'd. Thus would the Muse, who in thy wrongs takes part, Who feels the pangs which rend thy patriot heart, To sooth thy grief, her humble tribute bring Of lenient hope, shed from her trembling wing. Hope, our good Angel, with bright radiance crown'd, With healing hand, allays Misfortune's stound: Dispels the gloom which adverse tempests raise, And gilds dark Providence with orient rays: Points to the shipwreck'd mariner afar His port, and guides him like the polar star. What roused the Asmonean race to arms, Who shook the Syrian Tyrant with alarms! What steel'd the heart of Brutus, sternly good, To save fall'n Rome, redeem'd by Cæsar's blood! What led the Great, whose pinion'd fame does soar, Thee, Tamerlane! distain'd with eastern gore! The toiling Muscovite, Gustavus bold, To face each danger, when in arms grown old! 'Twas the big hope still bounding in their breast To save mankind, by tyrant pow'r opprest. The harvest reap'd in iron fields, to see Bless'd peace establish'd, and their country free. This arm'd fair England's champions for the fight, To combat Myriads in their country's right; Victorious Alfred stain'd with Danish gore, Her Edwards, Henrys, on the Gallic shore; Their swords the scourge of Heav'n, with vengeful glare Shook o'er the soe dread pestilence and war; While kingdoms, tyrants, shrunk before their frown, Whose scanty legion shook the Gallic throne. The land which trembling fear'd a foreign sword, With grateful welcome hail'd her laurel'd Lord: Wing'd conquest led: grim Bondage stalk'd behind, In rattling chains, she for the brave design'd: High-thron'd, her guardian spread the gifts of Peace, And freedom charter'd to a dauntless race: Beneath his buckler, loyal, bold, and free, They shar'd the golden sweets of Liberty. Oh Liberty! man's first and choicest treasure, Bright soul of virtue, sacred source of pleasure, Daughter of Heaven! with every blooming grace To charm the bold, and polish human race. Without thee Nature droops, and all we boast Of Country, Friends, and Kindred, all is lost: The plume of grandeur fades, life knows no blessing; No choice, no rich endearment worth caressing. The world, a dreary, darksome prison lies, Where all the soul of man within him dies: Dies to each great design, the minion tame Of guilty power, the slave of sin and shame. For thee, what hardships would the bold endure! How brave the vengeance of oppressive pow'r! How, following fierce thro' toil, war, bonds, and death, Resound the onset with their latest breath! Unconquer'd struggle, or, should freedom bleed, Sink, crown'd with glory, 'mid the honour'd dead. Descend, dread Goddess of the fearless eye! Come from eternal splendors of the sky! Oh! shield the nations from despotic pride, From rage and violence, usurping wide: And teach them rais'd, to guard, with manly grace, The native rights and honours of their race. Dread Goddess, rise! extend thine equal reign From farthest Ind' to Zembla's freezing main: But chiefly hover, with benignant smiles, Where, 'mid old Ocean, tow'r the British isles; Where thy true race, of mind and courage high, Repel the yoke of wasteful slavery. While dreadful o'er the subject waves is hurl'd, Like Heav'n's, their thund'ring storm, to shake a guilty world. Here fix thy seat, and blaze with Roman flame, In senates bold no tyrant arts can tame: Rouze them to feel for the atrocious deed; Brandish thy terrors at the guilty head: From mean submission vindicate the land, And give the vengeance to thy dauntless band: Till pride and stern oppression be no more, And foreign tyrants own Britannia's pow'r; Whose Prince and people prop the general cause, Supporting and supported by the laws; While savage bondage, driv'n abroad to reign, Feels her own scourge, and bites her iron chain. Ye generous Britons! could this verse avail To rouse your rage at suff'ring Freedom's tale; Then might the wretched, struggling with their fate, Revere thine arm, which props each falling state: Assert their rights beneath thy guardian care, And taste the sweets which you profusely share. But whither would my wayward fancy rove! Inrich'd with liberty and virtue's love, Paoli rests in hope; nor aught abates Of this prime anchor, 'mid the frowning fates. Ye mean usurpers, insolent through pow'r! Hang forth your trophies from Aleria's tow'r! Raze Freedom's seat! and when her sons complain, Load them to groan beneath a heavier chain! Bluster, ye Fates! ye stormy squadrons, rise! And sound the charge with thunder's dreadful voice! The Island trembles; but, estrang'd from fear, Her Pilot looks beyond where bright'ning skies appear; Where radiant hope breaks o'er the ocean stream, To gild her Shores, like Phosphor's orient beam. Meanwhile, exil'd from all the great can boast, From friends, from kindred, from your native coast: It will ever be remembered, with regret, how, after a hot campaign, the French army entirely reduced the brave Corsicans. Paoli (now beset with traitors and assassins, the mercenary pack set on by lawless power to hunt down the brave and unfortunate) left the Island, where he could continue no longer with advantage to his Countrymen. Landing in Italy, he passed through several states, where he was entertained with respect, and at last took refuge in England. There all ranks seemed to contend in paying homage to Fortitude and Freedom in the Person of Paoli. He was carried to St James's, and there courteously received; suitable apartments were assigned him; the chief of the nobility attended his levee; and, where-ever he passed, the people followed the Hero with public honours and applause.Honour'd and safe, by Thames' fam'd stream repose, Nor dread the guile of Cyrna's vengeful foes. Fair Albion joys thy kindred soul to trace, And speaks her welcome with a fond embrace: Unfolds her gates, the Brave Man's sanctuary, To shelter worth, and freedom fled with thee. Her circ'ling seas a shining bulwark stand To shield the patriot 'scaped from Pharaoh's hand. Here, while the tempests lour, and Bourbon waits, The hir'd assassin of weak Latian states: The mem'ory of thy country's wrongs efface In great designs, to save a sinking race; To pour the lenitive, with healing hand, In aching wounds that rankle thro' the land; And form with Roman skill the Cyrnean race, 'Mid war's alarum taught the arts of peace. Here whet thy rage, that when the hour shall come, When righteous heav'n shall seal the tyrant's doom, Paoli may in awful vengeance rise, To crush the proud, like thunder from the skies. And what may sooth the Brave, thy public cause Secures thee Britain's wonder and applause: Her Peers, the pride and bulwark of the land, The Sons of Freedom, give thee friendship's hand. Piercy and princely Douglas foremost found To tame the dragon, foil'd with many an wound: The scourge of tyrants grace thy modest gate, To mourn with thee sad Cyrna's ruin'd state. Behold! they come! Pembroke, of gallant soul! Thy pangs to soothe, thy Cyrna's foes controul: Whose order'd squadrons shake the plain afar, With thund'ring storm, to pierce the ranks of war; Pembroke, to ev'ry courtly grace ally'd; In fields the Brave Man's friend, and early try'd. See! Caledonia, once depress'd and low, When pow'r and slav'ry forc'd the brave to bow, Exalts her tow'ring front, and hastes to greet The cause of liberty, with rev'rence meet; Admires in thee the fire which blaz'd of old In Græme, in Bruce, in Douglas firm and bold, Who toil'd for Scotland in the throat of death, And peal'd her triumph with his latest breath. Her cities hail thee, and her senates wait T'inroll thy name with chiefs and patriots great. See Him! whom genius and true worth adorn, And early wreaths, from stern oppression torn; Who, rous'd by freedom's and by virtue's flame, First heard the clarion peal Paoli's name: Left learned ease and Albion's blissful shore, In distant climes thy fortunes to explore: There brav'd infested seas, nor fear'd to go Thro' hostile camps throng'd dire with freedom's foe, Till every peril past, 'mid fire and sword, Glad Boswell hail'd high Cyrna's warlike Lord. He hop'd to see thy righteous cause prevail, And sullen bondage mourn her sinking scale: Rehears'd the annals of thy rising State, And leagu'd with Princes to avert her fate. But now an exile from thy tribes, opprest With ev'ry pang which rends thy patriot breast; True cordial friendship glowing in his face, In Grief and joy he claims thy warm embrace: Invokes high heav'n to vindicate thy right, And rouses Europe to the glorious fight. So when proud Cæsar stretch'd his iron rod, Expelling freedom from her fam'd abode: The Mauritanian, smit with virtue's charms, Ador'd the Goddess in her Cato's arms; Arrang'd his myriads, kindling at the call, To humble Cæsar, or with Cato fall. Thus I, the follower of the tuneful croud, By winding Forth rehearse my sonnets rude, Nor rich to aid, nor pow'rful to redress, The Muse may mourn with greatness in distress: Breath her oraison, nor in blushes hide, Aw'd by the frown of insolence and pride. The sacred strains to worth and freedom due, Paoli! borrow dignity from you. The tears we shed when injur'd nations groan, Mount with their cry to the celestial throne. Nor lacks the Muse her burthen to complain; The lot of man is stamp'd with grief and pain. And she has mourn'd fell Envy's poison'd dart, And galling scorn, which gnaws the conscious heart; And foul ingratitude, the worst of crimes, To blast fair honour tried in bitter times. Of these she well could plain her baleful song, But patience checks, and other cares belong: To tend the charge the Sov'reign Sheperd gave, To feed my flock along the briny wave; To watch their safety from the prouling croud, But most from man, oppressive false and proud. There, whilst they haply brouze the wholesome flow'r, On sunny cliff, or sport the harmless hour, I ease my pastoral reed, and, pleas'd, retire To charm wild Echo with my rustic lyre. Or wand'ring, pensive, hear the brave complain, And consecrate to Cyrna's Chief the strain. ON THE LATE GREAT Naval and Military Preparations; Humbly Inscribed to the Most Noble JAMES MARQUIS OF GRAHAM, Colonel of the Caledonian Band of Heroes. Est et Volscorum egregia de gente Camilla, Agmen agens peditum, et florentes ære catervas, Bellatrix ? Virg. Heard you dread Mars his brazen clarion sound! Heard you the thunders of his wasteful car! Scotia's unconquer'd strength of hills rebound, And fierce descend her glitt'ring ranks of war. To arms, ye brave! and free! your Country cries, The voice of fearless Freedom and of Fame, Of parents, kindred, children, all we prize, Behind your shield their sacred refuge claim. For faithless Bourbon, sworn with tyrant boast To quench your glory, with unnumber'd band Of Death and Rapine, from his hostile coast Vindictive hastens to devour the land. Their furious purpose with insidious guile The Tyrants mask'd, rousing th'infernal brood Of Parricide against the Parent Isle To lift her arm, distain'd with kindred blood: Sad while we droop, spent with ignoble hate, Like the fell Vultures hov'ring o'er their prey, In iron fang would grasp th'enfeebled state, To groan beneath the scourge of tyrant sway. And shall mean Slav'ry lord it o'er the Isle, O'er Faith and Freedom, in whose cause was spilt Her childrens' blood; and the rich heirs despoil Of vast estate, the trophies of his guilt! Yet shou'd the Nine the trembling Muse inspire, And lift her reed to their full trumpet strain; Rouse Ocean's Queen, resistless in her ire, With banner'd terrors o'er the subject main; She'd call each Godlike Hero from the sphere Where bright enshrin'd they prop a nation's doom; And, ever watchful o'er the public care, Wait Heaven's high mandate to dispel the gloom. Immortal Russel! Bourbon's fierce controul; And Vernon! thou! who crush'd the pride of Spain: Dread Howard! Raleigh! Hawke's undaunted soul! O fire with Glory's call your kindred train! They call thee, O thou Great One! to arise, To save thy country, on proud Bourbon hurld, To pour her naval thunder, as the skies Roll the loud storm which shakes a guilty world. Britannia's awful Genius be thy guide! Inspire, auspicious, and direct the blow! As when Armada, 'mid the burning tide, Before her sons Lord Charles Howard, Lord Henry Seymour, and the bold Admirals Drake, Raleigh, Frobisher, and Hawkins, have made their names immortal, by completing the destruction of the Spanish Armada, when Philip invaded England in 1588. The renowned Lord Hawke overthrew M. Conslans, who had sailed from Brest to cover the then intended invasion in November 1759. And Britain hath, with a mother's joy and glory in her heroic son, recorded in her annals, in letters of gold, what will be read with peculiar exultation by the brave and free to latest ages, That, on the ever memorable 12th of April 1782, the most active and intrepid Lord Rodney, at a time when the British empire was brought into the most imminent danger, by the wicked combination of many powerful Princes, headed by the ambitious House of Bourbon, most successfully encountered the numerous fleets of France, with all their army on board, conducting by Count de Grasse, to join the Spanish armament, in order to complete the conquest of the West India Islands, and invade the empire where most accessible. The gallant Briton, fired with the public cause, fell upon the enemy's fleet with a spirit, skill, and fury unknown before, and spread terror, death, and carnage through every ship. With irresistible ardour, he continued this most bloody and decisive battle a whole day, till night closed upon the dreadful scene. The very flower and strength of the French navy was sunk, taken, or effectually destroyed. The undaunted Count de Grasse, who did all that man could do to prevent this fatal catastrophe, with his few surviving officers, fighting it out bravely to the last, was taken in the famous Ville de Paris, a most capital ship, which was the glory and boast of the French nation. Thus the irrisistible spirit and undaunted bravery of one great man gave a mortal blow for ever to this proud and alarming confederacy; turned the scales of a most disastrous and expensive war on the side of Britain, against all her numerous and vaunting enemies; and, under the particular direction of Divine Providence, who ordains the rise and the fall of nations, saved, by a most signal and complete victory, the British empire, when pushed to the very verge of destruction. The successful manœuvres of one skilful, active, and undaunted Admiral, whose soul was proof against every consideration, save the Love of his King and Country, established again, in the estimation of the world, the declining character of the British nation, maintained with splendour the empire of the seas, and diffused peace and tranquillity over all Europe. It will not be forgotten, that, in 1778, Lord Rodney defeated the Spanish fleet under the brave Don Langara, who, with his Rear-Admiral and several ships of the line, fell into his hands. He also reduced St Eustatia, where several millions in specie and merchandize were taken. The Dutch fleet richly laden, were also captured; and their Admiral, fighting bravely, was killed. Such heroic actions render Lord Rodney the most distinguished naval character of the times; and reflect a lustre round the Hero, which neither fortune nor nobility, nor the most flattering exertions of panegyric, can bestow; and which no clouds raised by Malice, Envy, and party, by outlaws and abandoned traitors to their ccountry, with all their impotent attempts, shall ever be able to tarnish or eclipse to latest ages. of glory, sunk in wo. Hail, Rodney! thrice with naval triumph crown'd, While Spain, Batavia, mourn thy thunders roar, And haughty France, transfix'd with mortal wound, Bows her proud sails, and dyes the seas with gore. For Thee, with trophies of immortal fame, Thy country decorates the arch of praise; With darling sons enrolls thy deathless name, Example! glory! boast of future days! Long shall the Muses sing in peaceful quire The Hero, He! turning with effort great The storm of war: 'mid thunder, death, and fire, Resolv'd to fall, or stem the tides of fate. And herald fame on angel trumpet blow Hesperian Isles redeem'd! the subject main Circling her empire! while the vanquish'd foe Mourn their proud league and pomp of war as vain. While Envy fell with clam'rous faction fled, Foul Harpies they! to blast thy flow'ring fame, In Hell's deep gloom shall hide the guilty head Before the triumph of thy loud acclaim. While thus her future theme in jublee song, Th'extatic Muse, with thrilling soul, surveys, Their native flow'rs she culls for Scotia's throng To wreathe the Crown of their immortal praise. Oft has the blood-stain'd Caledonian sword Repell'd Invasion from her sea-girt shore; In fields of death bright Liberty explor'd; Her gifts redeem'd from fang of lawless pow'r.

I see them Victors by Savannah's flood, Where dying Maitland won the civic Crown; Humbl'd Invasion in her stormful mood: Like him of Thebes entomb'd with just renown. I see the gallant Graham, with Buchan brave, Arrange their cohorts for the mortal strife: The Caledonian spurns the name of Slave, And without Freedom, Peerage, Wealth, and Life. Sons of the Goddess, of the fearless eye, Resistless, terrible the Heroes come; For Scotland sworn to conquer or to die, To purchase Freedom, or a glorious tomb.

Sprung from the far-fam'd Caledonian race, Thy raptur'd Country marks, renew'd in thee, That soul of glory, which in war, in peace, Encrown'd the fame of such prime Ancestry. Whilst Albion shakes beneath the thund'ring pow'r Of War and Discord, from Tain's shores they come, Like tempest, to dispel the stormy stour, With trusty swords, to fix a nation's doom. A nation's bulwark, tried in dire alarms, In them their Country calls Her champions forth, Her voice they hear, and, 'mid the strife of arms, Rush like the thund'ring tempest of the North. Nor droop, ye Brave! that many laurels crown One martial Maid: bright Dames of England! rise, By patriot-virtues, to that prime renown Which gives fresh lustre to all-conqu'ring eyes. Like Volscian Queen, o'er Latium's glitt'ring strand, Fearless She goes where spears and banners burn; Where Chiefs, officious, wait Her high command, And rushing cohorts at Her pleasure turn. In warlike guise pleas'd by Her side to wait, The lordly Wemyss, Captain of the host, Scans with a leader's eye their martial state; By the bright Maid himself distinguish'd most. At Her command, they hew their flaming way In length'ning column, horrent from afar: The noble Stewart guides their fierce array, And swells the onset 'mid the ranks of war. In dread array, o'er hill and dale they go Where danger calls, where on the purpl'd heath Proud Eiren fell beneath their vengeful bow, And Sweno mourn'd his glory set in death. Should villain Envy, fierce with basilisk eye, And venal Clamour, hell's foul harpies, tear The wreath of praise, your pinion'd fame shall fly, On eagle's wing, beyond their guilty sphere. On Scotia's hills unfading wreaths shall grow, Each grateful plain their flow'ry tribute yield; Her fairest nymphs shall deck the warrior's brow, Who o'er his Country lifts his guardian shield. With You shall all Your Country's wishes rest: Health to the Brave! who, prodigal of life, Scorning to bask in ease, with dauntless breast Arise her Champions 'mid the mortal strife. May Albion's awful Genius be Your guide Thro' fields of death: On You her civic crown Bestow; best recompence, when conscious pride, With Mother's eye, shall mark You for her own. VERSES ADDRESSED TO HIS GRACE HENRY DUKE OF BUCCLEUGH. Go, happy Muse! with grateful song explore The streams, and groves, which grace Esk's winding shore. There, down the deep'ning dale and vocal wood, Plain with the feather'd tribes your sonnets rude. Hear the first trooping choir salute the spring, How sweet the sky-lark and the thrustle sing; The finch and linnet blend their warbling throat In ceaseless concert, to the lively note Of mellow blackbird: Philomel so sweet Complain and Halcyon with respondence meet To the bass cadence of the waters fall; O'er gay parterres hear whisp'ring Zephyrs call, Charm'd Echo from her Princely Bow'r still answering to all. O'er blooming Cynthia's walks the Muse would rove, Nor envy Tempe's vale, nor fabl'd grove: A Fairer than fair Cynthia, bears command, Or She who haunts Eurota's flowery strand, And leads a brighter Choir: the angel grace Of young eye'd Beauty marks her Noble Race. The Train of blooming Hope sit smiling there, Full sweet the Fruit whose Blossom shews so fair! A nation turns, and marks with pleas'd surprise, The godlike Virtues of their Race arise: Sees from the Parent Tree his Branches shoot, With promise rip'ning into Golden Fruit. That best Ambition to be Truly Great, And wed bright Honour to a high estate; Making the tide of all their greatness flow Back to the ocean, whence its succours grow; To Bounteous Heaven, that gave a Princely Share, For blessing thousands cast upon their care: Gave Power and Worth, an image of her own, To shake Corruption on her venal throne: Gave Eloquence, to rouse the Kindling Band Of Patriots Firm, and save a sinking land. To crown Fine Talents, gave a Princely Soul, Like magnet faithful to its native pole; With ardor in their Country's Cause to burn, And every virtue to this Center turn; To stem the plagues which taint a nation's blood, The bane of Av'rice, Riot's torrent flood; The tide of venal baseness, and the shame, The worst to blast a nation's awful fame. T'unmask the snakes of Faction's hydra band, And crush each mean usurper thro' the land. T'expel the Stygian brood, and woo the grace Of public virtues to resume their place; Woo Concord, Peace, with wreaths of olive crown'd, From dove-like wing dispensing blessings round; The Public Love, which blaz'd in happier times; Bright Temperance, unstain'd with modern crimes: Rough Industry to build the common weal, And fraught with great designs the public zeal, To touch each cordial spring; the Parent, Soul, Like fire Promethean, to inspire the whole. They come, each glorious purpose to pursue; At their approach, see fading scenes renew; City and mart, with new-born pride appear, And rural scenes the bloom of Eden wear. Commerce, more gay, explores each distant land, And richer harvests tempt the reaper's hand. The cherish'd arts, with fond ambition join, To charm the Lib'ral Soul that makes them shine: Bright Science lifts aloft her starry head, And every Muse explores the shelt'ring shade. Such was my theme, as, by the winding stream Of shady Esk, I shunn'd the Summer beam; List'ning, I heard, or seem'd to hear, the call To visit, Noble Scott, thy Princely Hall: Following, with grateful step, “The storm is o'er,” I said, “my bark now finds a shelt'ring shore. “Th'insidious shelves are past, which lurking lay, “Like deadly Malice, to devour their prey. “I fear not galling Scorn's envenom'd dart, “Nor Envy's snake, which gnaws the villain's heart; “Nor critic's fang, nor harpy's hateful cry, “My Chieftain's Palace is my sanctuary.” Sept. 1784. VERSES On three Beautiful Sister Ladies Of great Fortune, in their Childhood. Sororibus componam parvula munuscula Musæ. An. Sweet Flow'rs! so fair which vernal hues begild, Etherial Gift! to grace our desart wild: Beneath kind skies, and fanning Zephyrs born, Your Fortha's shore, Prime Roses to adorn: Where young eyed Beauty smiles in saintly guise, As harmless Cupid all unquiver'd lyes, And Truth, with Innocence, and Peace, secure, Flying the world, haunt your blissful bow'r. Long blossom, fair! Hyperion, in his way, Shall foster Pearls, that shall eclipse his ray: The bright Hesperides, with tribute meet Of summer gales, their golden Blossoms greet: And Guardian Pow'rs unfading fruits bestow, Faith, Hope, and Love, which to the heav'ns shall grow: While native Forth, proud of her precious Store, Shall waft new Jasons from each wond'ring shore: Rival the Fame of Colchis' golden strand, And match the Wealth of either Indies land. Sweet Flow'rs of Hope! may no unkindly blast The orient sunshine of your morn o'ercast: Nor Pain nor Griefs' untimely storm appear, Shriv'ling your leaves before the mellowing year: But may the radiant Cohort of the skies, Like Argus, guard the Flow'rs of Paradise. Long with a Mother's eye, a Mother's prayer, In conscious rapture o'er her pleasing Care, Like Eden's peerless Dame in bless'd retreat, Bright Evelina, on your safety wait, Fost'ring your vernal hues. Long see you grow In Wisdom's soil: Your snowy bosoms glow With female Worth, prime sense of Honour high, Pure Truth, and Merit, sweet with downcast eye. Immortal Blooms! surpassing Eden's kind, Where Beauty shines the mirror of the Mind, And rises fairer from the waste of Time, To sky-born Lusture in the Heav'nly Clime. Hov'ring extatic with a prophet's eye, Hope joys her glitt'ring prospects to descry; While guardian Saints, in airy forms arrayed, The Blooms of Eden with their wings o'ershade. May 1781. VERSES UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF LADY GLENORCHY. Now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity—the greatest of these is Charity. —1 Cor. xiii. Vain the attempt to memorize thy name In this unpolish'd verse. The just record, Which bears the blazon of thy virtuous fame, To rear more lasting trophies can afford. To all indulgent, to thyself severe, Whilst prying Envy scans no faults to chide, You draw the veil, in form of Candour fair, That hides thy neighbour's vanity or pride. To squander wealth, and honour far more dear, Heap'd on the shrine of luxury and scorn, Full many toil: A nobler course you steer, Soothing the lament wild of worth forlorn. To tend the widow's and the orphan's cry, By vice oppress'd; to still the bursting grief Of female Virtue, with despairing eye, Sunk at her Spoiler's door to beg relief. To clothe the Naked, set the Pris'ner free, To feed the Hungry with the Bread of Life, The work is thine, O meek-ey'd Charity! Friend of the friendless, 'mid this mortal strife. “Thus guard my Flock,” the sov'reign Shepherd gave Supreme command; and bid such virtue rise From sin in triumph, and the ghastly grave, To crowns of life and glory in the skies. POEM. And—a certain man—fell—among thieves, Luke x. 30. To brave fell envy's shaft, and faction's rage, Teach me, firm soul of Athens, martyr'd Sage! Thou Cranmer! foremost of the sainted Band, Who round the crimson Altar radiant stand, Teach me with suff'ring patience to endure The scoff or scourge of persecution's power. When drunk with success, an imperious Nation Blasts ev'ry wreath with acts of indignation, Spoil'd of a Christian's right, of life, of fame, Let me admire in death immortal Graeme. O godlike race! whom civic crowns adorn, To crush the proud, to save your Country born; Bruce, Wallace, Douglas! fear'd in fields of death, Pealing her triumph with your latest breath; Beauteous in life, or 'mid the stormy gloom, When heaven mysterious call'd you to the tomb; Your bleeding Worth let me admiring eye, And greatly learn to live, or calmly die; Reckless of fortune's frown or faction's roar, Steer on my shatter'd bark to the celestial shore. Should my few days be doom'd in humble state Beneath the good, but far above the great, To pass: Hear, gracious heaven! my fervent prayer, And save my soul 'mid sorrow, want, and care. Be mine, affliction! not that stoic pride May scorn my neighbour, or thy counsels chide, Or holy spleen, with Pharasaic eye, Frown where the pardon'd penitent does lie; Faith humbly bend, and kiss the lifted rod; Nor fret thyself for man, nor impious question God. Be mine affliction! that my heart may know The bliss of heaven, to melt at human woe; To muster still on worth's deserted side, 'Gainst scoundrel rapine fierce, and scoundrel pride: In bleeding wounds the balm of comfort pour, And wipe the rain from ev'ry drooping flow'r. Be mine affliction! so in careful mood I urge religion's and my country's good, Tho' weak, with willing zealous heart engage To stem the torrent of a downward age; To wrench the scourge from proud Oppressor's hand, And brave each base Usurper thro' the land; Each sordid aim, each selfish scheme forego, And lose the private in the public woe. Oh! shield me Heav'n! when storms of envy break, And Rome combines with breth'ren false to wreck Treasure's endearing life; my spotless Name, My children, peace and fortune, whelm'd in shame, To please a Bigot's rage: when Malice' dart, And Envy's tooth which gnaws the villain's heart; When Falsehood mean, and Perj'ry's ruffian hand, With arts from hell involve the sacred Band Of man's own house: His children! gracious God! Nurtur'd 'mid jails, in want, in drear abode Of pinching poverty! o'er her clamant brood, Nurs'd in the desart with her streaming blood, Thus the fam'd Pelican attends, replete With strong sensations, reckless of her fate, To rear her callow young. Ah! vaunted Fair! Once subject of my songs, my love, my care, And angels deem'd, till snar'd by Jesuit arts, And chang'd to fiends, they act no female parts. Like her of Sorek See the history of Delilah, Judges, chap. xvi. ver. 4. &amp;c., false and foul as hell, By Jesuits taught 'gainst Nature to rebel In Perj'ry, Parricide, and Treason's fell. Oh! shield me Heav'n from this impoison'd Dart, When spiteful Levites pierce a Levite's heart With slanders keen. From the remorseless hate Of Joseph's Brethren, sold to slavish state: They saw the anguish of his Soul, when He, Guiltless, in vain, besought their cruelty. Fierce storms of persecution round my head, For ruin roar: Oh! God of mercies, lead My soul to patience firm, to peace, to Heav'n, Forgiving all, to pray to be forgiven. Then may some Christian friend, if such there be, In this rank world, the friend of misery; When Priests turn'd Atheists, swoll'n in Atheist pride, Defy religion, and my wrongs deride; The P?y Inquis?

TO THE ELEGANT SERAPHINA, PERFORMING ON THE PIANO FORTE, AT A PRIVATE CONCERT. Sweet Harmonist! say whence you guiltless stole Such soft melodious tuneful chords, controle Of list'ning Saints, of Terror, Death, and Pain, Who by thy magic, start to life again. Say, in Apollo's regions dost thou dwell, With the sweet Nine! in Meads of Asphodel, And garlands weave; bathing in raptures high Th'incharm'd sprite, in wells of Harmony. Or dost thou with angelic Choirs receive Th'afflicted Fair One, from the troubl'd wave Of Life's rude ocean: With harmonious flight, To steep the soul in streamlets of delight; Charming the pangs of mortal grief with song Divine, according with angelic throng. Oh! are thy dulcet strains which charming flow From thy sweet harp, unerring sign to show, That Virtue pure, that Chastity, and Love, The noblest passion that does Angels move, Which blessed Saints to noblest heights improve; With Elegance and Youth have built their cell In thy fair shrine, where all the Muses dwell: And bring us willing captives at thy feet, As Lion Monarchs did fam'd Orpheus greet; And hid their horrid fangs, their brindl'd mane, To hear the poet of false Love complain: In slumbers quench'd the light'ning of his eyes, To hear the minstrel mourn in deep melodious sighs. Oh! swell once more the high melodious flow Of angel symphonies, with exstatic glow; With rapture, spirit, execution bold, Like Saint Cecilia, or like Handel old, Prime Son of Orpheus, charming th'incharmed soul, The thrilling fancy, by sublime controle Of magic science. Again, when shall I hear! Thy tuneful numbers burst upon the ear, In ravishment divine; entranc'd behold Thy silver flying fingers, deck'd with gold, Roll back the tides of chastest Harmony, Meandring feuge, wrought resonant and high, O'erflowing ev'ry bound of mortal song, To lead the willing charmed captive throng, Thy conquer'd audience, bless'd from Heav'n to hear A Virgin Seraph guides the melodious sphere Of Science, Genius, Beauty, Youth, and Love, Which Heav'n admires, and her bless'd choirs approve. Say, warbling Philomel! 'mid thy beauteous train, What heart can hear unmov'd thy thrilling strain! Thy tender strains awake the soul of love, Thy music can the joys of saints improve; With charm divine, can kindle soft desire, Can sooth dull care, and set the soul on fire. When shall I bask recumbent by thy side, In glow of harmony's o'erflowing tide! Attend such strains as angels lean to hear From heav'nly bow'rs, and leave their blissful sphere, With sweetest Echo, sorrow to beguile, Thro' thy seraphic music. Oh! somewhile Soft bring me to thy bow'r, and let me know The bliss of heav'n in thy melodious flow. Oh! let me burn beneath thy Phœnix eye, And all the wiles of love and music try, Conceive the angel flame, Promæthean fire, And in sweet ravishments of love expire. EXTEMPORE AT A CONCERT Where L???

Fallen Royalty! for thee in Albion's dale, The Muse shall mourn, culling each fragrant flow'r To strew thy path: But what avail Her sacred tears to charm thy bitter stow'r. See the Ode to Sir Robert Murray Keith. Proud on Cimbria's throne reposing, Rob'd in garb of regal state, Troubl'd thoughts in vain composing The usurper Julian sat: Pow'r and grandure her pavilion, Rear'd high o'er the Baltic wave, At her footstool, fortune's minion Flatt'ry kneel'd a fawning slave. Yet the Syren's soothing blandish Fail'd to calm her throbbing breast; Yet transfix'd with secret anguish, Guilt in vain assay'd to rest. Round her purple couch entwining, Rous'd remorse her Gorgon train; Fear with jealousy combining, Wreath'd her glitt'ring crown with pain. 'Twas the midnight dreary season, When her death like watch appears; To the thorny couch of treason, Conscience told her dismal fears. “Oh! the keen tormenting anguish “That has robb'd my soul of rest; “Doom'd in the pride of life to languish, “With corroding cares opprest. “Nor the pageant pomp of grandeur, “Can the sick'ning fancy please; “What is greatness! what is splendor, “When the mind is not at ease! “Nor gay pleasure's courted potion “Can my inward bale controul; “All the waters of the ocean “Cannot wash the guilty soul.” Julian spoke, when startling horror Seem'd the knell of death to hear, O'er the wave lamenting louder, Female voices rend the air: Fades the taper's lurid lustre, Ghastly pale the Tyrant shook, As dread scene in radiant muster, From the sky the vision broke. All in dazzling glory splendant, Now releas'd from mortal frame, With bright troop of saints attendant, Albion's injur'd Princess came. O'er her starry front suspending Angels held a heav'nly crown, Whence so late the traitor rending, Dash'd the wreaths of prime renown. For the faded form of sorrows, Dying of a broken heart, Worth celestial Beauty borrows, Grace and joy that never part. Round the Princess Angels hover, Robes of radiance sweep the ground, Kindred Heroes dread discover Their imperial brows encrown'd. Hark! the voice of injur'd greatness, Like the midnight thunders drear, All dismays the scepter'd trait'ress, Conscious guilt, appall'd with fear. Think, thou! whose usurping grandeur Fills the Cimbrian throne of state; Think on thy detested splendor, Purchas'd by my wretched fate. Faith, nor League, nor fair Dominion, Could that fatal night restrain, When with murder and rebellion You profan'd my Blameless Reign. Now beyond thy shafts of malice, Rising to the starry sphere, Julian, in thy guilty palace, Thy dread doom with horror hear. Peace and Hope, sweet twins of Virtue, Shall be strangers to thy breast: Fell Despair, with Terror's wild crew, Still shall rob thy couch of rest. Round thy sceptre, gain'd by treason, Guile and factious strife shall twine: Base Dishonour, with full blazon, Crown that shameless head of thine. Thro' the world the hiss of scorning Still shall hail insidious pride: Public loss thy reign deforming, Public shame thy annals hide. Go! False Queen! your Triumphs muster, Soothe Remorse with Treason's boast; Spread your plumes in gorgeous lustre, Soon by storms of vengeance cross'd. In your gilded galley gliding, Urge thro' life your prosp'rous way: See! the deathful tempest hiding, Grimly waits his ev'ning prey. Go! like Ahab's varnish'd Princess, Seize the Children's regal right! Urge the brave, by false pretences, Call the triple shades of night! Spoil the vineyard! while the Keepers 'Tend their harmless dance and song; Press the vintage, busy reapers! Wicked Fortune crowns the strong! Hold that dagger! Angels flying From sweet Mercy's seat on high! Spare a Mother's second dying, In fierce arms of agony! Full my cup of deep affliction, From the dreadful dregs relieve; Let my Orphans claim protection, Let me rest beyond the grave. If one gleam of Hope ascending, Cheers the darkness of thy breast, When thy dream of state is ending, Think on Her you once oppress'd. Think on all my Sad Undoing, Torn in Youth from high estate; From my Zenith plung'd in ruin, To my grave pursu'd with hate. Think on all my rueful story, Murder'd by thy stern decree, Think on Denmark's martial glory, Think on England sham'd in me. ELEGY Sacred to the Memory of the Right Hon. the Lady Jammima Hope. Candida miratur limen Olympi. Celestial Visitant! who left 'erewhile Thy native skies, to brighten Earth's dull scene, Charming our twilight with thine angel smile, Life's troubl'd ocean with thy look serene. Thou can'st not die: Thy bloom shall never fade, Blown by the breath of Heav'n's creating grace; Thy purity in saintly robes array'd, Thy mildness splendent in a Cherub's face. Here set thy morning beam, Faith's eye sublime Can pierce where newly trimm'd thy splendors rise: So steals fair Hesper down the westlin clime: So lights his crescent bright in other skies. There far within the starry concave high, Where thousand Choirs carrol Jehovah's praise, And thousand Censers to their song reply, Flashing with dreadful pomp their golden blaze: You join Heav'n's jub'lee: or by streams of joy Hold sweet communion with a kindred Throng; Or round the Sapphire mount, in blest employ, Attend the inexpressive Nuptial Song.

Weary'd with griefs sad office, pleasing pain, To join with sorrow the consenting voice, The gen'rous sigh, and sympathetic tear; Forth from the lonly mansions of the dead, With fault'ring steps I turn'd, and left the Fane Where pious grief had led me to discharge My mournful tribute at Belinda's grave. To shed in sadness the soft falling tear, To strew the green turf with sweet smelling flow'rs, And sing soft rest to the departed shade. Disconsolate along the fresh show'r'd bank I slowly took my solitary way; The chrystal brook, which fed the bord'ring flow'rs, With plaintive murmers sought the distant vale, The curfew, solemn knell of day, prepar'd The world for rest; the chearful Sun had sunk His golden orb, and Philomel alone, Sole sitting in the neighb'ring grove, pursu'd With may a warbl'd maze her trilling strain. Down on the dark green grass I lay reclin'd, And while still night in ebon mantle clad, With silent steps, led forth her stary train, Thus sadly to the listning vale I mourn'd: O fatal day! thou bitter source of wo! Which left us poor bereft of what we priz'd: O cruel Death! which robb'd the world of joy, And for Belinda, comliness itself, Soft feeling pity, virtue mildly great, Wit, elegance, and open-hearted truth, Left us the cold pale corse; the dull remains Of worth returning to her native skies. O mournful change! how has Death's killing blast Transform'd the roses of that damask cheek To deadly hue! those eyes, with wisdom bright, Which like two friendly stars their blessings shed Benevolence and peace to human kind, How has dark night extinguish'd all their fire! That tongue which with the voice of music spoke, While more enamour'd still Palemon hung In pleasing admiration, as when men High favourd hear descending angels talk, How has dumb silence with strong magic bound The pow'r harmonious, never to awake, That look divine, pervading to the soul, That elegance of form, resistless shap'd By Beauty's finest hand; how has the bane Of chilling death each wond'rous charm destroy'd; And all ye nobler graces of the mind, Whom Fancy fails to paint, and mortal tongue But ill explains by words, how are ye fled From human sight! thou heav'nly piety, Conjugal love, sincere parental care, Domestic goodness, friendship, social joy Endearing life, kind sympathy which falls The generous tear, and hastens to relieve; Good nature smiling like the golden morn, Clear sense, and virtue fearful to offend, Each precious gift which bounteous Heav'n bestows, To shine admir'd, and bless the world with good. O ruthless Death! thy cruel hand hath cropp'd This beauteous flow'r, and rifled all its sweets! Belinda, in the beauty of her youth, Show'd like the poplar glory of the grove, Which lifts the verdant top, and spreads its boughs, Dispensing fragrance, till some stormy night Shiver its strength, and tearing from its seat, Spread forth the beauteous ruin on the plain. O early lost! in the full noon of life, When ev'ry grace shone in its summer bloom! The sad rememb'rance only now remains, Which, fondly whisp'ring what Belinda was, Recounts to thee, Palemon! all her worth, Renews thy loss, and on thy fancy preys. Enamour'd, o'er this precious gem you hung, And drunk in pleasure from its beamy rays; But, in ill-fated hour, rapacious Death, Like the night felon, stole, with silent steps, And quench'd thy diamond's blaze, and left thee dark, Forlorn, of all thy wealthy treasure spoil'd. No more the smiling Hours, on golden wings, Shall pass rejoicing, nor behold thee gaze On Beauty's face, enamour'd of her charms. No more, at ev'ning walks, shall hear the voice Of conjugal esteem, of tenderness, Of friendship, honest worth, and glad content, In busy converse join'd. Thy pleasing race, The fruit of faithful love, no more shall meet The Mother's fondness, hasting to explain Th'imploring look; nor friend nor kindred feel The virtuous transport, that endearing bliss, Which crown'd the social hour, when gentle peace, When harmless mirth, and honesty of heart, When wit refin'd, and gen'rous freedom, met. For now the friendly star, which lately shone So lovely bright, is shorn of all its beams; The beauteous blaze is set, and cheerless night Darkling succeeds. Yet know, Belinda dies Only to view; for, like the western sun, She set to rise with fresh resplendent beams In brighter skies, and shine with nobler fires, While Nature's Lord, who wak'd th'immortal flame, Has rais'd the splendor never more to set. Palemon, dry thy tears, and, with the eye Of holy faith, look up, this sacred truth Speaks wond'rous joy to thy deploring mind: Though for a space the stroke of death shall part Whom ev'ry wish and holy tie had bound; Yet shall they meet, the long lost friends shall meet, The tender husband and the loving wife, And meet rejoicing, they shall part no more. Such was my theme, while solemn Night began Her peaceful reign; fair Hesperus was set In the clear west, while, with unclouded ray, Night's Empress shone, bright Cynthia, from her throne. Glad of her silver beams in haste I rose, And homeward fast explor'd my weary way. Aug. 1757. To the Memory of the Right Honourable SHOLTO CHARLES DOUGLAS, EARL OF MORTON.

O early lost! thy Country's better prop In evil times—While the bright beam of Hope Circl'd true greatness! Heav'n's mysterious doom, Now veils thy glory in the dark cold tomb. A Star of Douglas sets; yet sets to rise In Heav'nly sphere, where Virtue never dies. Peace to the Brave!

VERSES FOR GENERAL WOLFE's MONUMENT. General James Wolfe was one of those Commanders who was early distinguished by the greatness of military capacity, combined with the most intrepid valour, with skill and ardour in time of action.—With such remarkable qualities he was chosen by the Earl of Chatham, and presented to the King as the most eligible officer to conduct the expedition against Canada, anno 1759.—After surmounting every obstacle, he routed the French troops in a decisive engagement; in which, like the illustrious Theban hero, he fell by a glorious wound in the moment of victory, being told the enemy were flying on every side, he expired with this gallant sentiment: “Britain triumphs! I die contented!” Here rests the Chief with civic honours crown'd, Immortal Wolfe, thro' either World renown'd: His country's boast; who Freedom's thunder bore, And conqu'ring banners, o'er Canada's shore. Whose soul of glory, Bourbon's fierce controle, Could bound the British empire with the pole. Thrice loyal, brave, and politic in war! Fall'n in thy Zenith, like a blazing star: “Britain triumphs,” the bleeding victor cry'd, And, smiling in the arms of conquest, died. Hail patriot worth! nor can proud fame afford To rival the bright trophies of thy sword; Nor conscious Britain boast a nobler wreath, Glory and Empire purchas'd by thy death: Thy death remotest ages shall admire; Thy trophies only with the world expire. November, 1759. TO THE MEMORY OF MAJOR PITCAIRN, And his very gallant Fellow Officers and Soldiers, who fell in their Country's Cause, in pursuit of Victory, against the Rebels, at Bunker's Hill, July 17, 1775. His saltem accumulem donis, et fungar inani Munere. ? Æn. Virg. What godlike form, from yon imperial car, Descends to trace the horrid waste of war! 'Tis Britain, sorrowing o'er her martial train, With cruel wounds by doom of battle slain. Nor crown, nor wreathe, her locks dishevel'd wear; She rends her laurels for her heroes' bier; She beats her breast, and, grov'ling on the ground, Embalms with tears each mangled soldier's wound, Calls on each dying Chief, and crowns the Brave With living fame beyond the ghastly grave. Thrice loyal, skill'd, and dauntless in the field! The Vet'ran's glory, and thy People's shield! How might thy Country, for her Soldier, spare The traitor croud, who mock the public care! Who see her life-blood stream from ev'ry vein, While selfish luxury and ease distain These dastard souls Pitcairn! for thee shall flow The Muses' tears—'tis all they can bestow. For thee, and for thy brother-heroes slain, The Sacred Sisters weep. On Boston's plain They hang your tombs with never-fading wreaths, A conscious Nation to her Sons bequeaths. True to her cause, a scanty loyal Band, They brav'd rebellion's hosts on Boston's strand, Struggling for Britain, in the throat of Death, They peal'd her triumph with their latest breath: 'Mid war's dread thunders, as immortal, stood, And seal'd her costly conquest with their blood. And now she celebrates their obsequies With honours due, and bids their trophies rise: On bleeding heart inscribes each fav'rite name, Her sons best monument to live to fame: And ever turning where the tombs around Of loyal valour bless the hallow'd ground, In fancy's ear laments, with wailing cry, “On yonder shore my clay-cold Warriors lie!” Thus, when bold Faction, leagu'd with impious hate, To rend the Roman or the Grecian state, Muster'd her lawless myriads, still in vain, Some orphan'd matron, 'mid the patriot slain, Her slaughter'd sons, with speechless grief, hangs o'er, With briny tears laving the crimson gore; Thanks the great Gods they for their country bled, And lays her children with the honour'd dead; While, hov'ring o'er, th'etherial herald Dame Sounds to the list'ning world the just acclaim. Sept. 1775, FOR THE MONUMENT OF THE HONOURABLE GENERAL CHARLES COLVIL. Ye whose consenting bosoms beat for fame, And fuel seek to feed the hallow'd flame This marble scan: Here noble Colvil's dust In hope reposes, with unshaken trust. Sprung from that race renown'd in many a field, Whose valour firm, the king's and people's shield, Blaz'd for their country, see their laurels twine With native worth, to crown the Hero's shrine, Where loyal zeal, and patriot love discreet, And martial praise, and social virtue, meet. O born to arms! to toil in evil times, When Britain's banner wav'd o'er hostile climes; And Freedom call'd thee with her dauntless band To quell proud Bourbon, or Iberia's land; To pour her thunder on the Belgic plain, And calm the storm of faction's rebel train. Then bless'd thy silver'd age, her conflicts o'er, With peace and fame, by Fortha's winding shore. Here, what is mortal of the brave, receive What sacred rest untainted faith can give; Victor thro' him who foil'd the grizly King, With heav'nly hosts triumphant carols sing. While we bewilder'd in our sphere below, Ascend the radiant path thy virtues shew; Mark all thy manly worth with conscious eye, And nobly learn to live, and calmly die. August 1775. ON THE DEATH OF CHARLES ERSKINE, Esq; of Alva, A young Gentleman of Fortune and Family, whose many excellent Qualifications once excited the most flattering Hopes. ? Nox incubat atra. Virg. Incircl'd sportive in his mother's arms, The sprightly Youth smiles sweet as breathing spring, Which flow'ry May on her fond bosom warms, Or mantles soft in dew-besprinkl'd wing. How sweet the fruit whose blossom shews so fair! What rising hopes distend a parent's breast! Who views, in golden dreams, his youthful heir, Belov'd of Heav'n, and by the world caress'd. In spring of life he puts his verdure forth, And gives his op'ning flow'rets to the sun; Like strength of summer, tow'rs his manly Youth, Rejoicing in some glorious sphere to run. But man is vain: in fancy's dream to-day He soars a vapour, by opinion fed, To-morrow comes, and all his beams decay, A wind arises, and the shadow's fled. Swift rising storms deface the vernal sky, The short-liv'd beauty of our morn is lost; Like flow'rs we flourish, oft, like flow'rs, we die, Cropt in the bud, by Death's untimely frost. Full oft, like Primrose and Narcissus fair, The blasted bloom of youthful hope expires; All vain the parents tear, the parents pray'r, When righteous Heav'n th'intrusted pledge requires. Full oft arrested in her mad carreer, Vaulting Ambition finds a narrow grave: Full oft the patriot claims the sacred tear, Bewail'd by thousands whom he toil'd to save. Nor high descent, nor wealth, nor state avail, Nor plumes more fair which dawning virtues yield: By Death's keen blast youth's blossom'd sweets exhale, Like lillies shrivell'd in the fading field. Hail, gentle Shade! while all thy pangs are o'er, And angels wreath thy never-fading crown, Fancy thine imag'd greatness would explore, The race of glory which thou might'st have run. Perhaps, thou may'st have reap'd a deathless name, With kindred Heroes in the warlike field, Whose glorious deeds blaz'ning the arch of fame, To great empryze their high incentive yield. Perhaps, thy noble spirit may have blaz'd In list'ning Senates for thy Country's weal; Dash'd Faction down, and modest Worth uprais'd, 'Gainst bold Oppression stamp'd the just appeal. Or girt with mitred Peers in rev'rend state, Taught Monarchs truth from Heav'n's celestial store; Or leaving care and grandeur to the Great, Bright science in her shady haunts explore. But, what avails fond Hope! thy fond desire To bless mankind! the grave's dark silent urn Seals up the rays of thy Promethean fire; O'ercasts the morn which never can return. Death's dreary shade has quench'd gay Fancy's ray, Where Hope so fondly mark'd each great empryze: Thy kind'ling spirit loaths the dull cold clay, Thy Virtues seek their own congenial skies. Thy golden gleam of morn is set in gloom, Around thy Bier the silent Mourners croud, Thy flow'rs of Genius shrunk into the Tomb, The tears of Pity bathe thine early shroud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Volume 2] TO THE MEMORY OF THE HONOURABLE WILLIAM LESLIE, Captain in the gallant Seventeenth Regiment, who was unfortunately slain when his Battalion forced their Way through the Provincial Army, January 3. 1777. CANTO I. Brave William was an Earl's son, His parents joy and pride; With knightly bow'rs their castle shone By Leven's crystal tide. His breath was like the vernal air, His cheeks of roseat hue, His manly form beyond compare, His eyes like April dew. Yet well he lov'd in sweat and toil To train his youthful morn, Aurora's dawn would oft beguile With voice of hound and horn; From grot and bow'r would oft repair The nymphs, with sly resort, Like Echo for Narcissus fair, To watch the hunters sport. Whose sweet officious courtesies, Meeting repulse, would prove, With blushing charms, how he defies He guile of softening love. Like that sweet boy Adonis. whom Venus woo'd, He love with coy disdain Would scorn, and laurel'd Fame pursu'd, Amid his dauntless train. And now, with sparkling eyes, he hears War's brazen trumpet roar, “To arms! her crest Rebellion rears On Atalanta's shore!” In vain his lovely Sisters sue His ardour to repress, In vain his Mother, drown'd in wo,— He leaves their fond embrace. And he has plough'd the sea-green wave, With many a martial train, All sworn the groaning land to save From Faction's galling chain; For likest Stygian fiends among, With bloody flags unfurl'd, Rebellion march'd her lawless throng To spoil the western world. And by her side, in false disguise, Of heav'n-born liberty, Licentious Faction, speaking lies, Strode in proud rivalry; Heavier Oppression laid her rod On ev'ry loyal head, And through, bright Peace! thy bless'd abode, Vi'lence and Rapin spread. The British Host, with eager sails, The ocean's dragon sought, And in her dreadful den assails; From morn to eve they fought. How glow'd brave William's gen'rous soul, Amid the strife of arms! Whose only wish was to controul Rebellion's fierce alarms. For Britain's glory sole he draws The steel, nor prizes fame, An empty sound! his country's cause Inspires a nobler flame. Now by a thousand foes inclos'd, With Murray Sir Alexander Murray of Balmanno, Bart, was a Scotch officer of family, and of uncommon merit. In the action of Long Island, August 28, his regiment, the gallant 17th, had the post of honour in the brigade which so eminently distinguished themselves under the conduct of the brave General Grant.—Sir Alexander was unfortunately slain at the head of the advanced guard, as he was bravely encouraging the soldiers. cut his way, And fearless Scott An officer who acquired that day great honour and public commendation by his intrepid valour., like lions rous'd, They drive the trembling prey. Now toils by valiant Percy's side, Where spears and banners burn, Where He, the soldier's Friend and pride, Does war's dread fortune turn: Or follows where fam'd England's Knight, Like guardian angel flew, Triumphant 'mid the deadly fight, To save the vanquish'd crew. Ah! 'mid the horrent clash of arms, He miss'd his warlike friend, Who wont, in time of fierce alarms, His per'lous steps to tend: And oft o'er the embattled plain He call'd, and o'er the heath; And often William rang'd in vain The pallid heaps of death. At last, low in the silent dale, He found this Knight so true, A lifeless corpse, all ghastly pale, His looks of deadly hue. Ah! early lost, like some sweet flow'r, Death on thy prime doth prey; How gallant 'mid the battle's stowr, And now a clod of clay! Ah! how shall I such tidings bear To Taia's winding shore! How tell thy wailing Kindred dear, I saw thee stretch'd in gore! With tears they bathe his crimson wound, With tears bedew his grave; His tomb with laurel wreathes is crown'd, Beside the sea-green wave. CANTO II. As yet wild Tumult rends the Shores, And o'er th'ensanguin'd plain Rebellion, dy'd in blood, deplores Her fiercest Champions slain: Nor quell'd by foul discomfiture, Like Hydra for her prey, Gath'ring her Train with guileful lure, She watch'd a better day. And soon that better day drew near, When Fate revers'd her loom, With keen revenge and conflicts drear, And many a Warrior's doom. Ev'ning drew on her silent reign, Still, as the watch of Death, Brave William, with his faithful train, Pitch'd on the whist'ling Heath. 'Twas Honour's post, who wreathes her brow With Danger, Death, and Fame; Hither to curb th'insulting Foe, With dauntless band, She came. Now ev'ry eye was clos'd in sleep, All in his Tent reclin'd, William allay'd in slumbers deep, The bale of anxious mind. Like one some direful message sent, With sorrow to disclose, A shrouded Ghost, before his Tent, His slaughter'd Friend arose: “Why sleep secure on hostile ground! “The foe have cross'd the wave, “With myriads sworn, like Captives bound, “To thrall our Vet'rans brave. “See Mawhood Col. Mawhood, who commanded the battalion, distinguished himself in the most particular manner, by his conduct and heroism, and received the public thanks and approbation. turn the battle's tide! “See hostile Champions slain! “I see the purple wounds you hide, “Slow drooping o'er the plain. “Follow! where patriot worth defies “All dangers, death, or shame, “Who greatly for his country dies, “Lives to immortal fame.” In air the mournful vision fled, While William nought dismay'd, Sprung from a hardy soldier's bed, And thus submissive said;— “Thou who in uncreated light “Presides! whose grace on high “Conducts the erring world aright, “And heav'n's immensity! “Thy soldier see! no selfish cause “Of guilty war pursue, “The sword his injur'd country draws, “To whom his life is due. “Whate'er my doom, by thy decree, “O may my country reign “Supreme! and Gallic perfidy, “And Faction's rage restrain.” Faint gleam'd the early dawn of morn, He hears with boding sound Of loud alarm, his Chieftain's horn; The Warrior's arm around. Before his loyal troop he flew, Like light'ning o'er the field, And swift where threat'ning danger grew, He Interpos'd his shield, But what can courage, what can skill, Against the deadly weight Of savage numbers, who, with guile, Th'indignant bands beset. In wedging brigade thrice they toil'd To hew their bloody way, And thrice, in circling orb recoil'd, Repair'd their grim array. Yield Leslie! yield! accept, young Knight! The terms which we bequeath, Nor longer in unequal fight, Brave an untimely death! The steel replies—with many a pass The desp'rate heroes close, And many a soldier press'd the grass Amid his dying foes. Breathing revenge the Britons fierce Explore their bloody way, The rebel toils, like lions pierce, To rend the hunter prey. Then thro' the horrid breach of war Victorious pour amain, And joyful 'scap'd, review afar The hostile heaps of slain. But ah! soon sets their clouded joy, William's deep wound reveal'd Damps ev'ry heart with sad annoy, He sinks upon the field! All help is vain, the life blood streams Adown his snowy breast! His eyes grow dim, two setting beams By death's dark shades o'ercast! The dying hero by the hand His mournful Chieftain took, Aghast the victor cohort stand, All faint sweet William spoke: “Droop not, my valiant friends! dismaid, “I meet a glorious death; “Britain triumphs!” he bow'd his head, And peaceful yields his breath. So have I seen a lily fair, Which vernal hues adorn, Sink blasted by the blust'ring air, Of all its beauty shorn: So seem'd the youth, Adonis was the son of Cynara King of Cyprus. belov'd in vain, Gash'd by the Cyprian boar, His snowy limbs sunk on the plain, In dust and crimson gore. O fatal doom of war! full well Britain for thee might spare Her sons who bask in slothful cell, And mock the public care, Whose idle pastime, dance, and song, Or shameless riot lewd; While in the battle's closing throng, The bravest spend their blood. For thee sweet youth! in Scotia's vale, The wood-nymphs fair shall weep, And wailing Echo tell thy tale, In ev'ry mountain steep. In silent grief thine Eden flow, And Leven swoll'n with tears, As thro' the grove in fun'ral wo, Thy whit'ning spire appears. Short was thy race! the setting beam Proclaims how high might grow The laurels of thy deathless fame, Had Fate delayed the blow. But ah! they dig thine early grave, By Milsone's crimson shores, Thy Parents mourn their William brave, Thy Country thee deplores! SAVANNAH. To The Immortal Memory of the Hon. Colonel JOHN MAITLAND, Brother to James Earl of Lauderdale, &amp;c. &amp;c. Member of Parliament for The District of Haddington, Dunbar, North-Berwick, Lauder, and Jedburgh; Whose Loyalty, Conduct, and Intrepid Valour Were eminently displayed At the Memorable Siege of Savannah, When, charging at the head Of his Invincible Caledonians, He repulsed the Combined Forces Of France and America, In a Most Bloody, Obstinate, and Successful Conflict, These Stanzas are Inscribed: A Sincere but Imperfect Testimony Of that Public Esteem and Veneration Which is justly due to the Worthy Friend And Lover of his Country. With invincible spirit, although wasted by a lingering sickness, The Hon. Col. John Maitland conducted Frazer's Highlanders through the various fatigues of a perplexing, laborious, and hazardous march, to withstand the hitherto successful progress of the arms of Bourbon and the revolted colonies. The presence and heroic exertions of so great a character aroused the valour of the British forces, to discharge their important trust in the hour of danger. The council of war were on the very brink of signing a capitulation, when Col. Maitland gave his voice for a most vigorous resistance, and threatened to report the officer to his Sovereign who should propose such a cowardly surrender. The speech and spirit of the Hero entered deep into the minds of the council. They cried out with one voice “to abide the onset, to contend for the rights and glory of their country. After many shining proofs of zeal and activity, of resolution and manly perseverance, Col. Maitland had the distinguished fortune to repulse the united forces of the enemy in that memorable and desperate assault which they made upon the British lines on the ever famous 9th of October 1779.—Count D' Estaing, Count Polaski, the French Generals Dillon and Fontaing, with the Rebel Chiefs, Price, La Motte, and Rutledge, (who was killed by the very gallant Capt. Tawse, after having twice planted the American standard on the chief redoubt), with all the flower of their troops, were either desperately wounded or slain. But behold the inscrutable ways of destiny! Scarce had Providence raised up this Deliverer of Britain, to check the growth of an unnatural rebellion, and to turn the scourge of a calamitous and bloody war against the House of Bourbon, when the joy of the victorious army, of his country, and of all good men, was damped by his death. Worn out by the most excessive toil and anxiety of mind, the Hero expired while the enemy were accomplishing their ignominious retreat. Britons! acknowledge the hand of Heaven in all these meritorious national services of the Hon. Col. Maitland, who, in the face of envy and opposition, of peril and death, and superior to every consideration which spurs on the disappointed and malignant petulence of our most distinguished modern Pseudo-Patriots, heroically re-established the declining glory of the British arms, in one of those most important and critical moments which decide the fate of nations. Imitate the active zeal, the unshaken loyalty, the enterprising courage, the manly ardour, and perseverance, of this truly noble and distinguished Patriot, who died, like another Wolfe, in almost the moment of victory, struggling to sustain the interests and the glory of his country, against the most formidable combinations of her enemies. Dysart, 27th Jan. 1780. Quis, te, Magne Cato! tacitum, te Cosse! relinquat! Quis, Gracchi Genus! ? Virg. CANTO I. Wasted by war's annoyance rude, Her hostile myriads closing round, Britain, by fam'd Savannah's flood, With scanty files maintain'd her ground. In front, proud Bourbon, to enslave, With fleets approach'd in dread array, The Gallic vulture from the wave, With keen eye hov'ring o'er his prey. Behind, Rebellion's ruthless train, Worst fiends of Discord, War, and Death, Conjoin'd to shake Britannia's reign, With slavish ensigns croud the heath. Silence kept watch with boding eye Along the bulwarks: Grief, despair, In doubt to struggle, yield, or fly, Distract the Chief with various care. For Gallia's boast D'Estaing., with Gothic rage, The stain of knighthood, and of arms, Who spares nor feeble sex nor age, Summons the Free with stern alarms. “Set wide your gates! I proffer life! “Rebels! receive your Gallic Lord! “Nor madly brave in deadly strife “The rage of his resistless sword. “This arm Grenada's wealthy seats “O'erthrew, and dash'd your island pride. “Brave not, ye slaves! the merc'less fates! “What storm, rage, carnage, may betide. “Three days in truce attentive weigh “The joys our faithful vassals share, “Beneath Gaul's mild, imperial sway; “The vanquish'd, Death! and black Despair! Suspence, Alarm, the ghastly Train Which wait on war, appal the Brave; And womens tears not shed in vain, Their infants, lovers, fires to save. Bereft of hope, bereft of aid, To prop their own or country's state, To yield the throng consult, persuade, All vain, to stem the tides of fate! One shameful day depress'd had seen Her warlike fame which climbs the skies, The scepter'd rule of Albion's Queen, Beneath her oceans, ne'er to rise: Her freeborn sons enchain'd, to rue Their worst disgrace, a Tyrant's prey; From freedom torn, and fealty true, To groan in bondage and dismay. And now th'unwelcome tidings go Where Britain's Champion, to restrain The savage inroads of the foe, Encamp'd his Caledonian Train: Maitland! far-fam'd, our stable prop In adverse times, train'd in the field; The Soldier's Friend, his Country's Hope, His Prince's Pride, his People's Shield. His vig'rous prime, 'mid war's annoy, Consum'd; not so the warrior's flame: Great daring darted from his eye, The hero glow'd thro' sickly frame. True glory fires his patriot soul, His pleading Country's Cause to save, False Bourbon's treasons to controul, Meet triumph! or a glorious grave! Anon his hasty trumpets sound, His vet'rans croud in stern array; The Chief imparts the tidings round, The Britons hear without dismay. “Haste on, ye Brave! your Country cries! “Fierce wolves of France and Faction wait: “The Freeborn, chains, shame, death, defy; “Your swords decide an empire's fate.” On vengeance bent, with hearts so true O'er marshy wastes they burst their way: 'Mid hosts of foes they struggle through, Like Nubian lions to their prey. Savannah's gates the wish'd relief Invite, where fears irres'lute reign, And doubtful cares distract the Chief To yield, or Britain's right maintain. Forlorn with toil, in dust and sweat, With Cato's spirit Maitland stood: Resistance urg'd with bold debate, And rous'd to arms the list'ning crowd. “Freedom your lot, or endless shame! “Your Country pleads in ev'ry vein; “And dares he boast a Briton's name, “Who scorns her glory to sustain! “Her sinking scale one great effort “O'er public shame and loss shall raise: “One glorious hour her high report “Redeem from stain of adverse days. “Let cowards skulk; to brave alarms, “Hark! Glory calls! In Heav'n I trust, “Bourbon shall bow to British arms; “Her laurels soil in blood and dust. “O Heav'ns! to turn war's headlong tide “With ruin on th'insulting foe! “Their vaunted trophies' guilty pride, “In vengeance' crimson'd fields laid low. “This palm I crave, thro' fire and death; “Eternal infamy entwine “The coward's ignominious wreath! “ See the Bard, by the elegant Mr Gray.To triumph! and to die, be mine!” His speech, like rain to drooping flow'rs, Lost courage thro' the host convey'd; They shine in arms, and from their tow'rs The bloody sign for war display'd. The brazen tires, destruction fell, Watch to disgorge the foes among, Peals from the spire war's dreadful knell, Fierce faces o'er the bulwarks throng. Yet e'er they turn to work of death, For feeble sex the heralds plead: “Meet refuge in your ships bequeath, “Nor see the child and mother bleed! “Pity! weak infancy, or age, “Or helpless Women, harm receive; “Harmless themselves: from battle's rage, “The loss and glory wait the Brave.” The plund'ring Goth with merc'less frown, As fierce he drew his thirsty sword, “No terms for yon devoted Town! “Save what the rage of storm afford. “Presumption vain, which dar'd impede “The Gallic Monarch's sov'reign sway; “E'er long, he cried, shall victim bleed! “That Rebel States may rue the day.” He said; and, with infernal roar, Their freight the thund'ring cannon cast; Attend the fiends of death and gore, The welkin rings with sulph'rous blast. Six furious days, thro' groaning air, Red fire, iron hail, destruction, ride; Six dreadful nights, with horrent glare, Their walls sustain the fiery tide. Protracted broil, with erring rage, The dastard foe urge on afar; The Heroes, burning to engage, Pour from the lines for closer war. The conflict grew where-e'er they turn, In closing strife their salcions ring: A thousand lances round them burn: A thousand deaths are on the wing. There toil'd Moncrieff of dauntless soul, The British Thunder skill'd to guide, Like Mars, whose mad'ning chariots roll Thro' raging Conflict's purple tide. Valiant M'Pherson, Fraser, Grahame, Like wolves assail, unquell'd by wounds: The path of conquest leads to fame, 'Mid fire, and death, with glory crown'd. The battle swerv'd along the field, Deep gor'd with dol'rous horns afar, The Goth recalls behind his shield His broken files, the wreck of war. Nor quell'd by foul discomfiture, Like wrathful dragon, for his prey, Gath'ring her train with guileful lure, He watch'd for a decisive day. CANTO II. Dark was the morn with low'ring shade, No swart star twinkled thro' the gloom; With raging storm the Gauls invade, And Rebel Hosts to seal their doom. Full soon the circling trench was pass'd; Fierce tribes, with desp'rate ardour stung, To scale the wall like furies press'd; Within, lament and uproar rung. Wild, in the van, with flaming brand, The furious Goth drew ev'ry eye; As dread he strove, with chosen band, To scale and fire the turrets high. Grim by his side, in Treason's guise, With rebel ensigns, Lincoln stood; The hireling Pole, Polasky, hies, Like falcon, bent on spoil and blood. Long hung the war in doubtful scale, On death resolv'd before they yield, Till savage numbers 'gan prevail With perseverance o'er the field. Pale fear o'er all the bulwarks sped, Despair unmans the Chieftain's soul, Their fire no more destruction spread, Their swords no more the Goth controul. And now the flying route give way, Redoubled axes rend the gates, The murd'rers mark their trembling prey, The sword of bloody Slaughter waits. One raging hour had sunk thy tow'rs, Savannah, sack'd with fire and sword; And Britain, crush'd by barb'rous powr's, Had bow'd in thrall to Gallic lord. When He, by guardian angels led, To turn the scale of death and shame, From Lincoln vanquish'd, Maitland sped, To die, or save his country's fame. Like lion rous'd, all dust and blood, 'Mid the wild waste of war he flew: These he transfix'd in wrathful mood, These headlong down the walls he threw. Again Britannia's banners fly, His trumpets sound her fierce acclaim, Beneath his steel what numbers die, Or refuge seek in flight and shame. Where victor Tawse, with glorious wound, Like tyger panting o'er his prey, 'Gainst hosts of foes maintain'd the mound, The Caledonians hew their way. With bold Moncrieff's congenial soul, An empire's fate, in throat of death, The Hero turns with shame and dole, Dashing proud Gallia's drooping wreath. As two fierce winds the tempest gloom, With flashing lightning fraught, dispel O'er Caspian brine, they stamp the doom Of Bourbon: Slaughter stalks the vale. The Goth, his fiercest champions slain, Beheld, and flies with ghastly wound. Polasky, soil'd by lawless stain Of war, expires before the mound. Stern Rutlidge, Price, and Odwin brave, Amid their mangled brigades lay. Not Dillon's soldier-skill could save, Nor Grasse A Colonel, a relation of the Count de Grasse. escape the bloody fray. Veiling in night his foul remorse, Lincoln, ignoble traitor! fled. Deep guilt, pale fear, impel his course, To leave the dying and the dead. Gnashing with rage, fell grief, and pain, The crest-fall'n Goth essay'd to hide Bourbon's deep wound: then o'er the main, Disgraceful, stems th'indignant tide. “And with thee go! that foulest stain “Of Bourbon's crown, to latest times, “False faith of Kings, not sworn in vain, “To mask the guilt of blackest crimes: “Rebellion's impious steel to guide “The sons to pierce the Parents breast, “Reckless what vengeance may betide “Their own, by Treason's fiend opprest.” And now the happy bands combine, Glad victors o'er the barb'rous foe, In dangers join'd, now join'd in wine, And mirth, their conscious hearts o'erflow. Britain's high fame and rights secure From Gallic fang and war's annoy, Heaven's rod to humble guilty pow'r, To Heav'n ascends their pious joy. Their civic wreaths the Victor greet, And homage due, as to his tent, Sunk down in glorious dust and sweat, Borne by his faithful guards he went. “Your praise, Brave Friends! to Heav'n is due; “The Hero spoke with plaintive sound: “Britain triumphs! proud France shall rue “In future woes this rankling wound!” Then, sad to see, all ghastly pale, A mortal qualm the CHIEF opprest; Cold sweats his trembling limbs assail, Convulsion heaves his manly breast: Whether heroic soul, enshrin'd In mansion frail of mortal dust, On highest deeds intent, rejoin'd Her kindred train, the brave and just; Or, like Hyperion, having run His glorious race, for brighter skies Departed, like the setting sun, Rob'd in his own ethereal dyes. In speechless woe hung o'er the CHIEF His Caledonians: help is vain! The hoary vet'ran droops in grief, The host lament an Hero slain. In death he cries, “Farewell, ye Brave! After the very unfortunate repulse of the British army before Charlestown, these brave Caledonians, in testimony of their intrepid valour, had the post of honour assigned them; and saved the remainder of the troops, by covering the retreat. “Conscience unfading palms bequeaths, “His Prince and Country's rights to save, “Maitland cou'd die a thousand deaths. “Fate cuts frail life! my lot is cast! “Immortal, loos'd from mortal frame: “Britain triumphs! from envious blast, “Oh! save your SOLDIER's honest fame!” With smile of conscious triumph burst That heart which cou'd for Britain die; Cou'd soil proud plumes of France in dust; Not villain Envy's shafts defy. Where Percy, Douglas, Wolfe, repose, With ev'ry high immortal name, 'Mid heav'nly hosts, the Victor goes Beyond the flight of mortal fame. Oh! hadst thou led with fair command Her host o'er Ashley's The campaign was from the beginning loitered away in a most shameful inactivity. Count Polasky threw in 1500 men into the place, and the Honourable Colonel Maitland remonstrated in vain against such most unworthy and unsoldier-like proceedings. blood-stain'd field! Where shrunk the vanquish'd loit'ring band Behind thy Caledonian shield: Thy Country ne'er had mourn'd in vain, Nor Freedom wept in tears of blood: Nor Malice mean, with guileful stain, Thy blazon of bright Fame withstood. Ah! round thy trophied arch of praise Envy's insidious harpies fly! With vengeful fangs to rend the bays Which loyal Valour hung on high: Vain strife! on eagle-pinions borne, Thy Worth's acclaim to heav'n shall go, Whilst Malice rides the blast of Scorn, Felon! to reap where others sow! Who yonder! gild the the ethereal steep, Bright Truth! dread Justice! awful train! With Caledonia o'er the deep, The vengeful demons to enchain. Ye Fiends! to Erebus! they cry, A nation's voice is in the sound: Lo! where she hastes, of fearless eye, To guard her SOLDIER's hallow'd ground. “Peace! to thy Patriot dust, the Brave, “And Free, shall yearly pilgrims come: “And oft suspend the dashing wave “To weep at MAITLAND's hallow'd tomb. “The Realm you sav'd with loss of life, “Each spring shall flow'ry wreaths bestow: “Her village Maids, with pious strife, “Fresh garlands on thy marble throw. “Where silver winding Fortha glides, “In grief, her rural BOWER's among; “Or devious Tweed in murmurs chides “The Swains' Arcadian dance, and song; “Scotland, while Autumn annual wears “The garb of Wo, her loss shall mourn; “And brightest eyes with pearly tears “In HATTON's GROVE bedew thine urn. “On Britain's bleeding heart be writ “My SON's best monument, true praise! “And herald Fame the theme transmit, “To fire her youth in future days! “But praise is weak: the Muse who sings “Thy dirge may not improve tehy fame; “And they who soar on bolder wings “Shall borrow from thy DEATHLES's NAME. Dysart, 27th Jan. 1780. TO THE IMMORTAL MEMORY OF WILLIAM DALRYMPLE, Esq; INSCRIPTION from the Marble Monument in Westminster Abbey, December 1782. To the memory of William Dalrymple, Esq; eldest son of Sir John Dalrymple, Bart. one of the Barons of Exchequer in Scotland, and of Elizabeth Hamilton Macgill, representative of the Viscounts of Oxenford. Who, tho' heir of ample estates, preferred to a life of indolence and pleasure, the toilsome and perilous profession of a seaman, when his country was in danger. At the age of eighteen he was one of the Officers who advised Captain Salter, and animated the crew of the Santa Margarita, to attack the Amazon, a French ship of superior force, in sight of the French fleet. Pleased with a spirit so like his own, that brave Officer, in a desperate action, took her, but his brave adviser sell! yet received, in the public dispatches of his skillful and generous Commander, the honourable testimony, “That he was a worthy and deserving youth, who, had he lived, would have been an ornament to his profession:” Yet leaving to his once happy parents (in whose fond eyes he appeared to promise whatever might be expected from genius, spirit, and the best gift of God, a kind and melting heart,) the endearing remembrance of his virtues. Father of all! grant to the prayer of a mother and a father, that the surviving children may imitate the qualities of such a brother, and that there may never be wanting to the British youth the spirit to pursue that line of public honour which he marked out for himself and for them! Obiit July 29, 1782. One of the Officers who fell in that desperate Action, when the Gallant Captain SALTER took the L'Amazon, of much superior force, in sight of the French fleet. Præclarum facinus gestum Monumentum est ejus qui gessit. Era. “Shall proud France, high domineering, “Lord it o'er our native main! “By her vain gods vainly swearing “She will end Britannia's reign. “Vainly Neptune sea dominions “To the Queen of Isles has giv'n, “If proud Bourbon's slavish minions “Dare dispute the will of Heav'n. “Vainly from our decks disclosing, “Tyres of vengeful thunders roll; “Vain on native deep reposing, “Britons rule from pole to pole. “Can the freeborn sons of Ocean “Droop before a host of slaves; “What is numbers! force! promotion! “Britain death with glory craves! “Hark! for bloody combat crying, “Hark! she pleads in ev'ry vein; “Scorning horror, carnage, dying, “Hearts of oak, her rights maintain. “Seven score heroes greatly daring, “Souls of glory, rough and true, “All the signal claim for warring, “Noble Captain! claim their due! “Dalrymple! spread our bloody streamers, “Pour our vengeance on the foe; “Teach yon Bourbon gaudy dreamers “Britons rule where sails can go.” The chieftain spoke, the hero gallant Spread the bloody cross for war, While the Amazon so valiant, Pow'r and pride drew on afar. O'er the waves triumphant gliding, Double strength to brave the foe, In his glitt'ring host confiding, Trimly did the Frenchman shew. Rough and bold the sons of Ocean Point their thunders cross the wave, Reaping 'mid the dire commotion Conquest or a wat'ry grave. By the red cross banner flying, Hark! the brave Dalrymple's cry! “For our country what is dying! “Brothers we have all to die! “Death with glory is the measure “Heaven to the brave bequeaths: “Amid fire and death with pleasure, “Brothers, twine the British wreaths.” Hark! the work of death commencing; Cannon shake the trembling flood; Thousand fiery fates are glancing, All is uproar, storm, and blood. In the combat foremost charging, Bold Dalrymple, youthful knight, 'Mid the deadly battle raging, Leads the storm, and swells the fight. Earth and ocean, heav'n resounding, Float the decks with streaming gore, Sulphur, horror, death confounding, Swell tempestuous, thunders roar. In the Frenchman, hideous ruin, All the officers in the Amazon were slain in the engagement, and the killed and wounded of the crew were above two hundred. Ghastly pale, bestrides the deck; Now too late he mourns undoing, Vaunted glory gone to wreck. Each hostile chieftain bleeds, retiring From the charge with ghastly wound; Breathless, vanquish'd, faint, expiring, Sinks the crew in slaughter drown'd. For the last assault preparing, Stagg'ring, hopeless, in their might, Bloody, maimed, and despairing, Brave Dalrymple stay'd the fight. “Yield, and spare your gallant remnant, “Who survive this mortal fray; “Vain yon tyrants proud pretendment, “George and Britain claim the day. “How my soul exults with glory! “That I urg'd the daring blow: “Brother heroes! bright in story, “Shall our names to ages go! “See! where Bourbon strikes her banner, “The Amazon is Britain's prize; “Hearts of oak will firmly man her, “From her staff our red cross rise.” Oh! dire mischance! the hero speaking, Deadly bullets pierc'd his heart; That manly heart which ne'er knew breaking, Save when dying heroes part! Ghastly pale he bleeds extended, In his victor ship, his bier! The sad crew in uproar blended Beat their breasts and rend the air. The tears of pity o'er the valiant Salter sheds in manly woe, O'er him at dawn of morn so gallant, Cold at eve, in death laid low. “Adieu thrice bravest Caledonian! “Envious fates have quench'd thy breath, “Not thy fame: The Amazonian “Shall unfading laurels wreath. “Scotland long with mother's sorrow “Thy untimely fate deplore; “Ah! untimely; fame shall borrow “From thy plaudit wings to soar.” Th'immortal Sisters o'er thy marble Long shall sound the note of praise; Grateful monarchs as they warble Shall thy marine trophies raise. There with peerless Chiefs reposing, Drake and Shovel, Russel brave, Learn from these thy mates disclosing, What is valour 'yond the grave. Crown'd with naval wreaths, thy glory Of heroic deeds bequeath, A peerless name, in Britain's story, That survives the wreck of death. Death, beyond thy house of mourning, Sets the brave from prison free; Thy pure sp'rit the world spurning, Basks in immortality. May heroic worth expiring For their country, honour'd sleep; May thy kindred train admiring Still thy bright example keep. Long thy parents greatly glory In thy valour's high renown: Britain long respect thy story, While she wreaths thy civic crown. Castle of Oxenford, 9th Sept. SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF COLONEL JAMES WEBSTER. Onward to the field where Slaughter Grim bestrides the crimson'd plain, Britain bleeds; Repulse has taught her How the strife of war is vain; Vain the host who proudly vaunting Glory in their warlike might, Vain the battle, Heav'n wanting, To direct the storm aright. Hark! the gallant Webster crying, “Courage, Brothers! of the field; “What is bleeding! what is dying! “Britain rests behind your shield. “Slaves of Bourbon, Slaves of Treason, “Rob our Country of her right; “Arms and valour these shall reason “While we have an arm to fight.” While a thousand deaths were flying, Fiery Fates destroying round, One commission'd for his dying, Sure, too sure, the Hero found. One step backward proudly bending, Stagg'ring, pale, the Hero stay'd: Mortally wounded, yet contending, Thrice he wav'd his flaming blade. “Save me, Heaven! from repining; “Doom of battle is from high! “Cheerful to my fate resigning, “For my Country I can die! “Had just Heav'n pleas'd to lengthen “Busy life one other day! “Fleeting life with hope would strengthen “Britain's trophies to display. “Hark! another summons calling, “In these gaping wounds away! “In the bed of glory falling, “Let me rest without dismay: “Brief my passage! life warm streaming “From my heart where ardours glow “For my Country, fair hopes gleaming “Shew their bright'ning scenes below. “Bear me where Cornwallis gallant “Swells the onset; 'neath his Eye; “Lay me where the Free and Valiant “Greatly for their Country die.” Webster spoke: The Chief declining, Gash'd with wounds in youthful prime, Peaceful sunk in death reclining, Like fresh rose in sultry clime. Round the clay cold-Hero lying, Stretch'd on his untimely bier, Mourn the Brave. Cornwallis sighing Sheds the Friends, the Soldiers tear. Tell loud fame the mournful story, Which will pierce a Monarch's heart: To his Country, who shall glory In her Son, the news impart. Tell his aged Father, stooping To the grave, his darling Son Bled for Britain! Tell him drooping How his glorious race was run! Tell a Sister's anguish weeping O'er her Father's, Brother's grave, Civic honours, with them sleeping, Crown the Worthiest and the Brave. St. Andrew's, 1782. St. Salvator's Coll. TO THE IMMORTAL MEMORY OF THE RENOWNED CAPTAIN COOKE This most intelligent and enterprising Officer was chosen by the Right Honourable the Lords of the Admiralty to conduct the several expeditions which were undertaken between the years 1768 and 1780, for the discovery of the south polar regions, and for exploring the several islands of the Great South Sea. What gave life and vigour to all these researches was the express orders of his present Majesty, the royal and munificent patron of scientific and naval discoveries, so beneficial to the interests of a great maritime state. How successfully these expeditions were conducted by this most famous circumnavigator is obvious, from the splendid edition of several large volumes, most elegantly illuminated with curious charts and drawings. Such was the avidity of the public to obtain the first impression of such interesting compilations, from the journals of Captain Cooke, that the whole large impression was bought up in the course of a few days, and the price of the book with the learned and curious, on account of the first impression of such elegant charts and engravings, rose from four guineas the set to eighteen guineas, in seven days. These volumes contain the most authentic, the most curious and interesting narration of all the wonderful discoveries made by this great man, and his very learned associates, the most ingenious and philosophic Mr Banks and Dr Solander, the learned disciple of the great Linnæus; also a particular and minute account of all his many hardy, dangerous, and enterprising voyages. A new and very elegant edition of the four last volumes is with all expedition now preparing. The work will be executed in the highest taste, by the most eminent London artists, and merits the attention and encouragement of the public, when all things are considered, in a very distinguished manner.. Humbly inscribed to the Right Honourable Lord Viscount Keppel, First Lord Commissioner, and to the Lords Commissioners of his Majesty's Board of Admiralty. Wand'ring from clime to clime, observant stray'd, Their manners noted, and their states survey'd; On stormy seas unnumber'd toils he bore, Safe with his friends, to gain his natal shore: Ah! man unbless'd! Mysterious Fates ordain Him never more to reach his native plain! Odys. Has Britain such a son, to dare the pole Where never sail was spread, nor seas did roll, Chain'd in eternal frost! Through years of toil, T'explore these unknown coasts: see ocean boil In storms of freezing horror, storms of fire, And death, which bid the boldest hearts retire To Zeeland's joyless bay: bleak refuge sure, Where, in the dreary clime, Chaos demure Sits brooding o'er her empire, and combines The elemental war: Where uproar joins A thousand voices, and the startling ears Of wild affright her thousand horrors hears, Tremendous bursting Icebergs! mountain ice, Coeval with the storms, floating device Of ocean, launch'd, to block Antarctic seas From Cooke's bold search, and the bless'd moment seize To save the poles. Great, daring, vent'rous Soul! How couldst thou three times wind the southern pole! Thrice brave keen famine, death, with vent'rous prow, And thrice amid the wreck of Chaos go, With Britain's cross, where never helm did steer: With thy bold Argonauts, these limits drear How couldst thou, Jason-like invade, and view, Undaunted, Argo Navis fires renew Their radiant path; and mighty Chiron roll His glitt'ring cohort thrice around the pole! Such hearts of adamant the gods bestow On chiefs, who toil that Britain's fame may grow. Hail Noble Guardians of the subject main! Whose bold research nor wind nor wave restrain; Nor winter's freezing horrors of the pole, Nor arctic nor antarctic can controul: Go spread your sails! another world to view, And chiefs your bold researches to pursue, Send forth as spies, or trace the blissful isles, Where everlasting spring with Venus smiles, And youth and beauty in the bow'ring shade On Eden's couch, by past'ral streams are laid. Explore new Canaans, people, commerce, stores Of nature's knowledge, wid'ning with her shores. See the the vast waste of ocean boundless roll O'er either tropic to the freezing pole, In whose kind lap, the harmless nations lie, Unknown our guilt beneath a purer sky: Nor foul disease, The Hollanders or the Spaniards had unhappily communicated this malady to the inhabitants long before the arrival of Captain Cooke in the South Seas. till Europe visit paid, And cruelly, Calypso's Nymphs betray'd. Visit the frozen isthmus, sea or land, Which joins the Asian to Nuadas' strand: Hear Russian Bosphorus, with sullen roar, Lave with white foam the high approaching shore. Or see great nature build her chrystal mound Eternal ice grim ocean's northern bound; Where these two ample continents disjoin'd By mighty Neptune, lie in frost combin'd In strong embrace: There sails no further go, But tow'ring mountains of chrystalline snow, With star-eyed Hydra's flaming Orbits glow, And bid the Spy of ocean southward turn, Where radiant bands of blazing Orion burn. These wint'ry realms of storm explor'd, the muse Attends the Chief, and hails his ling'ring crews Amid the Friendly Isles. There peaceful dwell The Sun's prime offspring in their flow'ry dell; His gentlest sons and daughters, who defy The pride of dress in naked majesty: Nor seek the leaves of Eden to conceal What nature, climate, custom, there reveal. How sweet your rest beside these murm'ring streams! How sweet your joys! all fairy golden dreams, By brightest Nymphs and Genii lull'd asleep, And ever by young Loves entranced deep In joys of Paradise. Oh! envy'd wiles! Of artless beauty, in Calypso's isles! As fancy guides bold youths! employ your time, Hark! Britain calls you to another clime. There northern Kametzchatka's dreary strand, And frozen Isles, your daring toils demand: Again your British hearts of steel, for see The surly race in savage chivalry Brandish the pond'rous club, and peal alarms, So save their desart clime from British arms. Their scaly cinctures cast, they raging fling The pond'rous mass, and launch the whistling sling. How many cares, how many hopes and fears Distract the Hero's soul, who faithful rears Britannia's cross on barb'rous shores, and strives To keep her honour safe, and precious lives Intrusted to his guard. No wrongs shall stain Thy blameless record, where each deed humane Begilds the page: Bright Mercy's form appears With Prudence hand in hand, and modest wears Her angel viel. Ah! mystic fates bequeath To crown thy worth, the fairest civic wreath. In direful dangers prov'd, ah! must we come, Renowned Cooke! to wail thy hapless doom. Exploring various kindred tribes which lie In lone retreat beneath the eastern sky, Those secret stores which Providence does hide, Till Heav'n mysterious draw the veil aside, And shew her grand Designs: There woful fate Arrests; which drown'd in tears the Nine relate. Where vast Pacific rolls her ocean stores, Embracing eastern Sandwich verdant shores, The lonely Islands verging to the north, Beneath the tropic stretch their bulwark forth, Breaking the South Sea foam: There overhead The champion Sons of brightning Leda lead Their starry trains to light grim Neptune's way, For wandring prows who bless the well known ray, Which nightly guides them, from the deeps of air, In fair array, winding with radiant glare Revolving march. By margin of the deep He met the angry Demon, who did keep Jealous Hesperian Climes: And guards the poles Arm'd with black storms. A Dragon now he rolls His cumb'rous length, with deadly fangs and mail: A hideous Fury next, with dire assail Of flaming brand. Anon a Lion, shakes His brindl'd mane: The deepest forrest quakes With horrors dire. Behold yon savage Rout, Rous'd by his roaring, pour with barb'rous shout In weeds uncouth, in feather'd cinctures proud, And rugged skins of Phorcis' scaly brood. They rush to dread encounter: O'er the strand The Demon strod, to guard his native land, With envious glare: “Ye Spoilers, come not here “To spy our weakness: Britain's brandish'd spear “Contends in vain. Her Chiefs no further go, “With over-curious search, my realms to know: “The secrets of th'immeasurable deep “Safe with old Chaos in oblivion sleep. “Here I your boundary have watchful set, “To guard my crown, by foreign guile beset. “The circle's mark'd, which shall your range confine “In narrow grave: To deal this justice mine. “Hence back, ambitious Briton! none shall know “The secrets of my empire; none bestow “On stranger brows my crown.” He said, and near The horrid savage Rout for death appear: The Demon leads, and o'er the purple strand, They stretch the scanty harmless British band. There Cooke renown'd, all heaven and earth explor'd, Fell by the jealous Demon's guilty sword. Thrice hapless Chieftain! could this verse avail, I'd fill the world with thy disastrous tale The author residing in a remote part of the country, had no opportunity till lately of perusing that most elegant Monody on this mournful subject by the ingenious Miss Seward. The richly flowing fancy, the fine exertions of true poetic genius, by this Fair Sister of the Muses, had deservedly superseded all farther attempts as vain and unnecessary.; Renew a Nation's grief, a Monarch's tear, With decent rites to grace thy mournful bier. For thee, thy orphan'd Mates in vain deplore, A mangled corse upon Barbaric shore: Nereus and Doris, with their Daughter Train, Bewail thy fate in caverns of the main; And furious Neptune drives his fiery brood, To whelm the Fiends drown'd in the briny flood. Thou, Widow'd Dame! who o'er his empty tomb Weeps while fond memory augments thy doom, Admit the stranger Muse with thee to mourn The Naval Chief, and monumental urn Rear in sequester'd grove: With decent wo, Like thine, her unaffected sorrows flow. The mournful Muse, who in thy loss takes part, Who feels the pangs which rend thy widow'd heart, To soothe thy grief would pious tribute bring Of lenient hope, shed from her trembling wing. Hope, our good angel, with bright radiance crown'd, With healing hand allays thy bitter stound; And points thy Cooke, beneath another Sky, Exploring wonders, with extatic eye; Where brighter Suns do light him on his way, And blissful Shores encharm his long delay; And new discover'd Realms and Tribes receive Th'amazed Stranger, shipwreck'd, from the wave Of this dark world, which lib'ral spirits find Is all a dungeon-prison to the mind, Which in Etherial Sphere exults to go Thro' depths of knowledge, never reach'd below, And reads the God in all. Imperfect here The tree of knowledge in our twilight Sphere: But these New Heavens and New Earth proclaim Transcendently the God: Their glorious frame Below, leads man to know himself, and raise 'Mid Cherub Choirs, divinest songs of praise To Him, whose works thro' wide creation's bound Unknown, how shall heaven's Architect, himself unsearchable, be found! Exalt thine eye! thy Cooke is gone before On this last voyage, to that native shore, Where thou shalt join him, nor be parted more. Triumph thou lonely Fair! thy Chief shall go On wings of Fame, beyond where seas shall flow. Thy Faith and Truth be sung by Britains Fair, Who nightly did his nuptial robes prepare, And chang'd, unchang'd thy heart, all joy to wo, Saw Prince and People tribute tears bestow: In face of Kindred read the dire alarms Of Cooke you long'd to welcome in your arms. St. Salvator's Coll. St. Andrew's 1784. TO THE MEMORY OF ALLAN MALCOLM, Esq; Of LOCHORE; Heir and Representative of the ancient Knights Baronets of Lochore, Captain in the 33d Regiment of Foot, who was mortally wounded at the head of the Advanced Guard, in the moment of victory, over the Provincial Army, and expired with many brave Gentlemen on the field of battle, before the walls of Charlestown. Vita brevis est, gloriæ cursus sempiternus. Cic. Hark! the wailing voice of sorrow Shrieks adown sad Ora's vale, See the sedgy Sister borrow Weeds of mourning and bewail! Youth and valour warm in dangers, Fall'n in battle, cold as clay, Slain for Britain, among strangers, She laments the fatal day. Young Sir Malcom, fir'd with glory, For his country sought the field, Where her Chiefs renoun'd in story, Fought with hearts unknown to yield. Scorning sloth and guilty pleasure, While his country calls to arms, With the boldest he would measure Spears, and rouse the fierce alarms. Gallant spirits! who defying Danger, in the throat of fate Toil for Britain, to her dying, Leave fair honour's vast estate. “We her champions fiercely warring, “Spend our blood in mortal strife, “Toils and dangers, nations daring, “For our country, death or life. “Life, her civic honours wreathing, “These a nation toil'd to save; “Death, immortal fame bequeathing, “Be our treasure in the grave.” Malcolm spoke, amid the burning Of bright spears he rush'd amain, Proudest warriors overturning, How he shook the trembling plain! Thrice the broken ranks repairing, Like a lion o'er his prey, Fround the youthful Hero, glaring Terror, death, and wild dismay. Thrice retreating, thrice advancing Britain's banners on the foe, Where a thousand deaths were glancing He receiv'd a deadly blow. Wounds retard not bleeding valour, Scarcely death his lance restrains, To the last a fierce assailer, Still he charg'd the flying Trains. Till the floods of life decaying, Like the Youth on Timnahs plain, E'en in death his foes dismaying, Malcolm sunk amid the slain. Mournful Ora heard the tidings Ecchoing 'mid her wat'ry bow'rs, Diving thro' her chalky hidings, Sad she seeks Atlanta's tow'rs. In her silver grasp intwining, There she warms the stiff'ning Clay, With her fountain Nymphs combining, There she shrieks in sad dismay. In her chaste embrace the Warrior Shrouded pale in Ora's arms, Passes Ocean's foaming barrier, Ever dead to war's alarms. The etherial sp'rits ascending Swift explore their native sky, The terrestrial parts attending O'er the deep with Ora hie. There beneath the blue waves sitting, She bewails her clay cold Son, Fun'ral wreathes of purples knitting, Thrice she shriek'd his course is run. Nine times in balmy dews of morning Ora laves his breathless Clay, And with king-cup flow'rs adorning, Hides him where her fountains play. In her wat'ry chambers keeping, All her naids round the bier, Lota, Gilda, Kenla, weeping, Wild their raven tresses tear. “Thine these honours Youth and Valour! “These our Virgin Griefs bestow, “Thou couldst brave each rude assailer, “Thou for others lyest so low” Seven ambrosial drops selecting, Where in caves her fountains run, In his torpid ear injecting, With meet rhymes, she call'd her Son. Gentle Ora learn'd the magic In Levinia's chrystal hall, When the Sisters mourn'd so tragic Caledon's In the old war songs the Scottish Princes had their names from the territories over which they presided; so the ancient Caledonia, Scotia, Angusia, Argathelia, &amp;c. untimely fall. Then from secret gulphs enraging, She, with Leven's deluge wide, Sweno's The Scandian Princes, as the most ancient records inform us, frequently invaded Caledonia. The Friths of Moray, Tay, and Forth, which water the eastern coasts, were navigable for a long way by their numerous fleets of small burthen. Landing their troops about Whitsuntide, near the river Leven, then, with all her tributary brooks, overflowing her banks, they were defeated by Constantine 2d, with great slaughter. Great numbers perished in the river in attempting to escape the sword. This Prince, much renowned for his justice and valour in war, was afterwards cruelly murdered by these desperadoes in a cave near Crail. Some noted obelisks mark the field of battle to this day; and, on the north banks of the river Leven, are still to be seen the most famous monuments of the Scandian Princes who fell in this desperate invasion. These battles were fought an. 874. bloody Peers engaging, Whelm'd 'em deep in Fortha's tide. Hence the brightest Nymph of Ocean Taught her spells of Old Albain, To recal, by mystic lotion, Fearless Youths in battle slain. By the boon of Shepherd Royal, Who could tread the Syrian lake, Will at times the Chieftain loyal From his deathlike trance awake: And at certain seasons fitting, He is known by kindred train, By his Mother, Father sitting, Warding evil, grief, or pain. Fancy sees young Malcolm stalking Nightly in his lonely hall; Kindred Fancy hears him talking, Where the airy voices call: Fond Remembrance views him sporting At the toils which charm the brave; Lavinia's Nymphs, with dawn resorting, Mark his horn adown the wave. From her chrystal lakes o'erflowing, Mournful Ora loves to weep; Hark! her whisp'ring reeds rank growing, In her tears their plainings steep. With indignant currents wand'ring, Sullen, slow, She winds her tide, From deep Dens and Spells meand'ring, Where accursed Wizards hide. They with Hags and Demons plotting, Just, nor good, nor pity know; But the human feature bloating, Jeer in scorn at deepest wo: They with Scoundrel Tribe assailing, Lewdness, Riot, Envy pale, Ruthless drive the Muse bewailing Far from gentle Ora's vale. Yet the banish'd Halcyon hiding, Loves by groves and streams to dwell, In Arcadian train confiding, Seeks, sweet Tweed! thy flow'ry dell. Native valleys! streams! and mountains! Yarrow! Jed! fair Tiviot's wave! 'Mid refuge of your hallow'd fountains, From vile fang of Harpies save. Take me to your green retreating, Where the Sisters Nine reside, Where, in bright assemblage meeting, Beauty, Valour, Worth, abide. Leave, Oh! leave me not to languish That I sung the Loyal Brave; Soothe the bursting heart of anguish, Decking once each hallow'd Grave. The tuneful Nine, in angel pity, Steep the Muse's melting strain; Scotia hears the Shepherd's ditty, Sung by her bright Virgin Train. Genii of her lakes arising, Nightly guard each Hero's bier! Wat'ry Naids! Merit prizing, O'er them weep the sacred tear. O'er the silver flow'rets tripping, Which embroider ev'ry lake, Fairy Elves! your orgies keeping, Carol till fresh morn awake! Echo's coyest Nymphs! resorting, Leave your ivy-mantl'd cell, And with herald Fame reporting, Wide their civic virtues tell! Village Maids and Swains, reclining, From your toils, at ev'ning hour, Hear the Warrior Shades repining! See their torch in storied bow'r! Peaceful rest their silent dwelling, By Atlanta's western lake, Till the Sovereign Pow'r compelling, Bid their dust to life awake. Caledonia guards their glory, Which the Loyal Brave have won, Deathless in the Muses story, Shall their honour'd plaudit run. Tweed shall waft the fav'rite ditty Down her rural, devious wave, While their Parents bursting pity Fresh bedews their early Grave. St Salvator's Coll. St Andrew's. TO THE MEMORY OF THE HONOURABLE HAMILTON DOUGLAS HALYBURTON, BROTHER OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE GEORGE DOUGLAS, EARL OF MORTON, First Lieutenant under Commodore Sir Charles Douglas, on the American station, who, with all his brave Fellow Officers, unhappily perished in a tempest, on the Jersey shore, whither they had gone to quell a mutiny among the British seamen. Sunt lachrymæ rerum. In his lofty ship revolving Watchful cares for Britain's fate, 'Mid his fearless Chiefs resolving, High, the warlike Douglas sat. By merit rais'd to envy'd station, He who rules his native main, To restrain the rebel nation, Sends the Bold with Chosen Train. With the dauntless Knight consorting, Noble Douglas, stern in strife, Leads his Heroes Against all earnest intreaties of Sir Charles Douglas, the Hon. Hamilton Douglas Halyburton went with the following officers into the barge to stay the mutiny of the seamen, viz. Lieutenant James Champion of Marines, Messrs James Haywood, Charles Gascoine, William Sprey, George Towers, George Faddy, William Scott, David Reddie, and Alexander Johnston. They were some hours after put ashore upon the Jersey side, and after the tempest abated were all found frozen to death in one another's arms. The other three gentlemen, Messrs Andrew Hamilton, Robert Wood, and William Thomlison, were also found frozen at a little distance: They had attempted to reach the shelter of a house. See the letter from Commodore Sir Charles Douglas, London Chronicle, May 6, 1784. Brave, resorting For their Country, death or life. Fiends of discord, fiends of ruin Their abhor'd dissentions spread, Like fell pest'lence, undoing All that Loyal Virtue bred. Wide and far the plagues of faction, Like the brood of Sin and Death, Drive the nations to distraction, Famine, fire, and sword, and wrath. Sons of Belial proud assailing, On vast wings of havoc flew, And their rebel shame unveiling, Tempt with guile the British Crew. All beneath the mask of friendship Treason crys, “Your toils are vain! “Vain your strife, your cares, and hardship, “Fortune crowns our freeborn Train! “Shall vile yoke of courtly Minion “Thrall the free unshakl'd soul! “Shall their guilty base Dominion “All your joys of life controul! “Sons of Freedom! Heirs of Pleasure! “Fly the jail of loyal Slaves, “Seek the Goddess golden Treasure, “Freedom hides beyond the waves.” Strange to tell, the Sons of Ocean, Late so loyal, rough, and bold, Poison'd by the Syren potion, Barter all for rebel gold. Hark the noble Douglas calling “Arm ye Brave! for traytors doom; “By your sword of justice falling, “Treason meets a wat'ry tomb. “Thro' the Navy burns infection, “Loyal mark your Country's cry; “Stem, bold Chiefs, the tides of faction, “Or with Douglas dare to die. “Go, thou bravest Son of Thunder,” Crys the fearless Douglas Knight, “May thine arm disperse asunder “Thousands in the mortal fight. “May thy chosen Band so gallant “For their Country rich return, “Wreaths of glory wait the Valiant, “Who the scales of danger turn.” Far, their chearful shouts resounding, Douglas climbs the blue top'd wave; Swift on snowy pennons bounding, They the furrow'd ocean cleave. As the royal eagle flying, Drives the troublers of his reign, Wasteful vultures shrilly crying Down the steep etherial plain. So before him fled the traitors, Spent with toil, a hapless prey, Remorse and terror mark their features, Sunk in trembling and dismay. Now submissive, kneel th'offenders, Nor in vain to Douglas pray'd, He, for them, and their defenders, The keen sword of justice stay'd. Now they penitent returning, To the Chief allegiance swore, And with shame and sorrow burning, Leave the hated Syren shore. When the foaming billows roaring, Prelude to the coming storm, Lift the barge of Douglas soaring On rough edge of waves deform. In dire conflict, winds engaging, Loud and hoarse, outstorm the waves, And with uproar wild enraging, Vex old Ocean's deepest caves. On the horrent summit riding, As on headlong verge of fate, Noble Douglas, firm confiding, Thus bespeaks each trembling mate. “Courage, Brothers! fearless Britain “Rides the storm of angry waves; “And by many tempests beaten, “Undismay'd their rudeness braves. “Amid toils and death, our station “The superior Fates have plac'd: “In her Sons th'unconquer'd Nation “Ne'er by us shall be disgrac'd. “Calm within, the Brave resigning, “'Mid tempestous seas repose: “Guilt, on downy couch reclining, “Never peace nor resting knows.” Anon, the tempest, Courage speaking, To resistless fury grew, All their hopes and fortunes wrecking, Tenfold horrors rush in view. Furious winds the onset blowing, Rain, with thunder, fire, and hail, Mountain waves to heav'n growing, Wild for death, the Band assail. “Earth and Heav'n, Air and Ocean,” Douglas cries, “have all decreed, “In this direful rude commotion, “That our loyal hearts should bleed. “Icy hand of Death is closing “Fast on all; in close embrace “Let us perish! firm reposing “Lasting hope in Heav'n's Grace.” Art and courage nought availing, Freezing cold arrests the Brave: Death their glowing hearts assailing, Chills them 'mid the boiling wave. There the angry Demons shrieking, 'Mid the wint'ry tempest flew, Vengeance for their kindred wrecking, Whom the Brave in battle slew. Airy ghosts of widows wailing England's youth, by Douglas slain, Wrathful, hagard looks unveiling, Swell the horrors of the main. 'Mid th'etherial uproar riding, These with storm the youths o'ercast, And in icy mantle hiding, Bleach them in the northern blast. Adieu, ye Bravest! death enduring For your Country: Jealous Fate Stamps your exit; praise securing, Herald Fame shall on you wait. Long your Country mourn, lamenting O'er her Children: Th'adverse Crew Of hostile faction, sad relenting, Hang your tomb with trophies due. Hark! the wild fowl, shrilly wailing, Sing their dirge: The airy Throng, With British oak their brows inveiling, Guard each hallow'd Corse from wrong. 'Mid his Bands, in speechless sorrow, Long shall Douglas mourn the Brave: Fond Remembrance ever borrow Wreaths to hang their hallow'd Grave. Long, with grief, their Kindred bending, Shall bedew their empty urn: Long, the tuneful Sisters, blending Verse with tears, in pity mourn. St. Salvator's Coll. St Andrew's, March 1784. ELEGIAC POEMS. ELEGY I. To Miss B?. Hushd was rude Winter's blast, the breathing Spring Had wak'd each flow'r, and tun'd the vocal grove, Had shower'd fresh roses from her purple wing, And sent through Nature the great Soul of Love. To hail the year in woodlands warbling round, In hawthorns blooming, youths and maidens hie; The Beauty, sick of fops, all empty found, The faithful Lover, worn with many a sigh. Then bright S?, sprightly blooming Maid, Pride of the circle, and the Poet's theme, Left high Edina, for the greenwood shade, The balmy Zephyr, and the murm'ring stream. She pass'd, like Cynthia, whom the Virgin Tribe, And youthful Band, with sacred songs adore; Her eyes dart fatal shafts on ev'ry side; She pierces hearts, and kills with secret pow'r. How graceful on the sea-beat mole she stood, With Love's black Tresses waving to the wind; With Venus' eyes she calm'd the raging flood, With Venus' smile she sooth'd each storm unkind. His bark the hurrying mariner prepares, Proud of his beauteous Freight, and plies the oar; A thousand Lovers send a thousand pray'rs, To speed her voyage to the fort'nate shore. Meanwhile the Nymph, with highly blooming charms Like Egypt's Queen, sat Sov'reign of the Main; Her beauteous look sharp Eurus' breath disarms, Her graceful smiles the swelling tides restrain. Old Neptune smooth'd his brow, and hastes to bear Another Venus; the gay smiling skies, And Zephyrs shed for joy a show'ry tear, And fann'd the sail with breath of am'rous sighs. Cupid, as o'er the winding Forth he flew, Mistook the Fair One for the Paphian Dame; Choice arrows from his sounding quiver threw, And burning mischief from his torches flame. Swift to the greenwood shade She beauteous hies, With flow'rets fresh to deck her sylvan Bow'r; Thrice bless'd the Youth! selected by the Skies To share thy Virgin Love, thou fairest Flow'r! Go, Lovely Nymph! for thee the season glows, The balmy Zephyrs fan the cooling grove, And wafting odours from the blushing rose Attune thy soul to Harmony and Love. ELEGY II. To the Same. When pleasing cares disturb the youthful breast, When ardent sighs speak forth the heart's desire, When hopes and fears consume the hours of rest, Then Venus sets a lover's soul on fire: Then would I scorn the wealth which many chuse, And look on gay plum'd honour with disdain: Th'inspired mind a nobler aim pursues, And Venus' slave submits to Venus' chain. Should Fame, or Pow'r, or Wisdom, plead to move A lover's mind, with all their specious shew, While Venus soothes me with the smiles of Love, Like Paris, ever at her shrine I bow. While S? smiles, with lovely beaming eyes, Here let me kneel; no other boon I claim: Beneath the sun the Phœnix burns and dies, Beneath her charms I burn with grateful flame. Sweet are thy smiles, O Fair One! and bestow New life beneath the sunshine of thine eyes: Deadly the shaft of scorn from Cupid's bow, And where it strikes, the hapless lover dies. The Merchant dreads the rage of winter seas, And fearful cares surround the Tyrant's crown, The Mother hears of war with trembling knees; I know no danger but the Fair One's frown. A Lover prays, vouchsafe a gentle ear, Be kind as beautiful; then shall I joy A sweeter Music than proud Art's to hear, And for the fairest Form my verse employ. ELEGY III. The Author to his Lyre. To the Same. Awake my Lyre! thy sadly pleasing strain Shall sooth my anguish, while thy numbers flow: Awake my Lyre! it fits thee to complain, In sounds according with thy Master's wo. Sweet as my Love, thy voice O tuneful Lyre! And Youths and Maids attend thine am'rous lay: Like Her you plaintive feed a Lover's fire, But yield no hope his torment to allay. In vain, great Hermes destin'd thee to charm, In vain, the Sisters taught their Bard to sing, The Pow'rs of Love the Pow'rs of Art disarm, And all thy magic can no comfort bring. Phœbus in vain would wake thy Siren sound, To calm the tumults of a Lover's breast, The God of Love each captive sense has bound In cruel Chains, nor gives his Victim rest. Yet shall thy sad and solemn music say, How much I suffer, and how much I love, And bright S? shall thy song repay. With pity where her Charms destructive prove. ELEGY IV. To Mrs R?, of R?h?se, On a Visit in Sickness. Ut vidi, ut perii, ut me malus abstulit error! Scarcely escap'd from Eurus sick'ning blast, Stagg'ring and faint I left the bed of Pain, And like some half wreck'd mariner aghast, Revolv'd the various horrors of the main. In sad review like troubled dream arose, The pains of life: And what is life I said! A fleeting April flower, a vernal rose Born in the desert world to bloom and fade. And what is life mis-spent! A noisome weed, That taints the air till it forever dies; And what, when it thro' Virtue's path does lead Our steps; th'immortal flower of Paradise. Thus pond'ring, lo! a female Form drew near, In Vision bright, with youthful Beauty crown'd, Such as of Dian's band were won't appear With quiver'd pride to trace the woodlands round. Her aubourne Tresses graceful seem'd to flow In dainty curles, shadowing her iv'ry Neck, Her cheeks with purple light of Love did glow, And morning sweet, seem'd in her Eyes to break. Like jocund Queen of May, she smiling said As gently by my side she took her place, Why do'st thou pine forlorn, in dreary shade, Why suffer rankling Care to spoil thy peace. Has ill-requited Love o'ercast thy day With clouds; or stern Misfortune caus'd thy pain: Some faithful Fair One can thy smart allay; Pastime and Converse sweet, our ease regain. Thus spoke the Fair: By none of these forlorn I droop; 'tis sickness pale has made me dwell Recluse, and many a pang that I have born, But say who kindly greets my lonely cell. Thy charming sympathy bespeaks thy place, Some Nymph Angelic, who with magic pow'r Of pity bright'ning in so fair a face, Descends with joy to gild life's darkling hour. Or Hebe thou! who crown'd with youth divine, Bestowes the nectar'd bev'rage of the sky; For sweeter nectar from these Lips of thine, In speech distills, and pleasure from thine eye. Or art thou She who down the flow'ry shore Of winding Forth with bright Hygeia stray'd; Fair Queen of Health, and young ey'd Love who bore The double prize, and mighty conquests made. Ah! from what Sun bursts on my ravish'd sight This beam of Beauty, while these shadows fly; And now I mark thy faultless form aright, Shap'd by the faultless hand of Harmony. Maria! thou, who late like Scotland's Queen In radiant Circle, made all hearts your prize, Superior 'mid our star-ey'd Beauties seen, Like Venus, when she gilds the Westlin skies. Who e'er I be, the blushing Dame rejoin'd, I come to bring thee to our social Train, Where friendly Converse, Wit, and Mirth combin'd, Forever smile, and banish Care and Pain. And we have built high o'er the murm'ring deep With curious art, renew'd, our vernal bow'r; Where Peace and blyth Content their pastimes keep, And Nymphs and Nereids grace the festive hour. Then leave your cell, and leave this dull annoy, And you shall hear the Syren Sisters sing; Whose songs shall steep your charmed soul in joy, Or win you forth to hail the new born spring. Maria spoke, and to her bower we go; The blooming Bevy heal'd my sickness smart; But soon I mourn'd the fiercest shaft of wo, For cruel Cupid pierc'd my bleeding heart. SONNET To FAIR CLARA. To the Same. Lips which Venus might adorn, Hide! oh hide! your coral dyes: Stars which do mislead the morn Sparkling bright in Clara's eyes; Hide your beams! nor in your sphere Tempt a Lover to despair. Cheeks where vermil roses glow, Iv'ry neck of radiant guise, Sweetly swelling Breasts of snow, Where inshrin'd young Cupid lies, Hide in shades of golden hair, Nor tempt a Lover to despair. Involv'd in Zephyr's honey'd breath, Ah! by magic charm undone, Ah! I meet a noble death, Phænix like, beneath the sun; Both an envy'd fortune prove, He for Glory, I for Love. SONNET See anonymous verses. The additional stanza by the author. To the Same. He who Hebe's dimpling cheek, Or Venus golden locks admires, Or from star-like eyes does seek Fuel to maintain his fires; As old Time makes these decay, So his flames must waste away. But a chaste adorned Mind, Gentle Thoughts, and calm Desires, Hearts with mutual love combin'd, Kindle never dying fires, Where these are not, never prize Golden locks nor radiant Eyes. To what female Shrine so fair This prime Sisterhood resort; They each mortal charm repair, Grafting their immortal Sort; Beauty fades like April morn, These with lasting Grace adorn. Sir AMBROSE AND Fair PORTIA. Inscribed to the Amiable Miss H?. CANTO I. Sir AMBROSE sat in tower so high, Feeding his constant smart, With charm of chastest imagery, Instamp'd on faithful heart. Below the sea green billows roll'd Responsive to his song, While list'ning to the tale he told, On wing the wild fowl throng. “'Tis not the bloom of young desire “When roseat hues adorn, “And Orient Beauty's gay attire “Smiles like an April morn: “'Tis not the fleeting dream of love “My sick'ning fancy warms, “Nor looks, nor eyes, which artful move “To kindle Soft alarms. “Let the fair Syrens sly deceive “The gaudy saunt'ring throng, “Who, scorning merit, idly grieve “Such fairy scenes among. “Far nobler prize my heart constrains, “Yielding to soft controul; “Far other beauty binds in chains “The magnet of my soul. “For Portia, fair and peerless maid, “With modest looks and smiles, “Like blush of virgin rose display'd, “My feverish thought beguiles. “Though She like stately pine appears, “By Fortha's verdant shore; “Though She her golden tresses wears, “To shade her goodly store: “Yet here more sovereign worth enshrin'd, “Eclipses Beauty's 'Tyre; “More lasting beauties of the mind “Here fan a Lover's fire. “Discretion, with adornment rare “Of every power to please, “Good nature, of angelic air, “And Virtue leagu'd with Peace. “The generous sigh for others good, “Prime tenant of the breast; “Pity, who lends, in melting mood, “Her hand to the deprest; “Contentment, Truth and Chastity, “All met in holy cell, “Bless'd sisterhood of Piety, “In Portia's bosom dwell. “O! had Sir Ambrose there a place, “In her esteem to stand, “He would not prize the fairest face “That shines on Fortha's strand. “O! might he wait by Portia's side, “Like Squire of low degree, “Partake the pleasance such divide, “Nor fear proud rivalry. “Like captive bird, within her bow'r, “Soft minstrelsy employ; “Her ear with warbling prelude lure, “And kisses sweet enjoy. “Thrice bless'd, such excellence to woo, “With constancy discreet; “My faithful heart, my faithful vow, “Offering with incense meet. “For her I'd brave the torrid zone, “'Mid freezing Zembla pine; “Pierce the Siberian wilds alone, “Potosi's deepest mine. “For her, with rival Knights, I'd bear “The weight of helm and shield; “Couch in the van the quiv'ring spear, “She purchase of the Field. “Fierce tournaments for Her explore, “Her fame, with trumpet sounds, “Proclaim on Nile or Ganges' shore, “And write my love with wounds. “But ah! how vain my vows and pray'r, “Which Portia may deride! “Which only Echo deigns to hear, “Sung to the winds and tide. “How vain the strife, by hardy deed, “My loyal flame to show, “If Portia dooms true love to bleed, “Regardless of his wo! “Yet let me gain the victor's wreath, “New garlands for the Fair; “Ennobled by a Lover's death, “These passion true declare. “Let my last song, if not with joy, “Be fraught with doleful sighs, “Mine elegy: 'Mid death's annoy, “So sings the swan, and dies. “What though I paint, in passion'd strain, “The anguish of my heart! “This only feeds a lover's flame, “Not heals a Lover's smart. “What though the Fair, with beauteous smile, “Essay'd my thoughts to prove; “Arm'd her coy glance with magic wile, “And taught my heart to love: “Yet must I feed a hopeless flame, “A hopeless toil pursue: “Not choice, but Fortune, yields the Dame, “And Fortune is not true. “With suitors vex'd, like Argosee, “By adverse tempests tost, “She wrecks her golden treasury “Upon an unknown coast. “Thus prying censure blames; not so “Her cautious choice I deem; “Pond'ring on life's important throw, “Perchance a golden dream. “Some of the goodliest fruits we meet “A treacherous poison hold; “The fairest flowers not always sweet, “Not all that glisters gold. “Safe from the world's ensnaring lure, “Like Saint in holy cell, “On heavenly Providence secure, “Her hopes and fortunes dwell. “To Heaven she yields her Spousal Choice, “With holy credit new, “The sacred lot, Heav'n's solemn voice, “Confers a Bridegroom true. “And she has plac'd in holy bow'r “Three lots, with mystic pride; “Who happ'ly draws in favour'd hour, “Has Portia for his bride. “Full many a Knight of good degree “His hopeful fortune tries, “With oraisons to Pow'rs on high, “To yield the envy'd Prize. “Full many a youth of gentle kind, “Like bankrupt merchant crost, “Curses false Fortune's cruel wind, “Wrecking his gainful boast. “And now with dawning morn elate, “To Portia's halls I hie, “Hanging the chain of all my fate “On wheel of destiny. “O! may yon guardian Choir above “My prosperous venture met! “O snare this silver bird of love “In mystic toils she set! “Rightly, ye Pow'rs! my footsteps turn, “Who all my fortunes scan; “Else never, never to return, “I go a banish'd man! “Never to see bright Portia more, “Nor friend nor sacred home; “Nor sportive Muse on Forthas' shore, “But through the world to roam.” CANTO II. O'er glitt'ring waves now dawning morn, Purpl'd, Sir Ambrose, tow'rs; The Sun in golden chariot borne, Starts from his eastern bowers: All nature wakes: The woodlands round Chant to the sky-lark's song: The Shepherd's flute, with jocund sound, Pipes to the bleeting throng. The fields rejoice in sunny dale, The village tribes repair To morning task; or artless tale Rehearse, devoid of care. Ambrose alone estrang'd from joy, Forsakes his couch of rest, Where doubts and fears, with pale annoy, Had scar'd his anxious breast: And ever waking jealousy, Like guard of Argus' eyes, On watch, lest chance or rivalry, Should steal his golden Prize. Forlorn he pass'd the sleepless hours, Pond'ring his devious way; Where shelt'ring in hesperian bow'rs This envy'd Treasure lay. And now his horn with shrilling sound Summons in Gothic hall His trusty yoemen, gath'ring round, To 'tend his early call. “Fair smiles the morn with cloudless shine, “Meet emblem of my Love; “O might her smiles with charm divine “My faithful vows approve! “For now I go with Knightly State, “To woo this peerless Dame, “And mystic Lot decides my fate, “Repaid with Love or Shame. “Thro' distant lands and desarts drear, “Our arduous journey lies, “But what is labour, death, or fear, “While Portia fair the prize! “And let us march in martial boast, “Each on his stately steed, “Discourteous Knights on stranger coast “May rude contentions breed. “Or should my hopes be foil'd, I go “Forlorn with trusty band, “To drown, in arms, a Lover's wo “Warring in foreign land.” He said, his faithful Yoemen bold, Must'ring in gorgeous wier, With stately steeds, and banner'd gold, Around their Chief appear. Proud he bestrides his courser brave, Like Knight in days of yore, When riding o'er the Colchian wave, He claim'd his golden store. Onward they pass, o'er length'ning plain Urging their eager claim, Nor hill, nor flood, their course detain, Nor Phœbus' sultry beam. O'er dreary dales, like hawkes pursue Elate, their distant prey, And o'er the mountain path renue The toil of many a day. The shaking marsh, the foaming deep, The desart wilds, in vain, Where plund'ring Hords their station keep, Their patient Rout restrain. At length bright morning's cheerful beams, More grateful scenes disclose, With verdant fields and past'ral streams The flow'ry vales arose. With sweet vicissitude they change, The pathless wilds and muirs, For rural hamlets fair arange, Gay lawns, and stately tow'rs. The recess of a mountain steep A tuneful grove display'd, Where Love and Venus seem'd to keep Their haunt in cooling shade. Pomona yielded fruitage sweet, Flora her fragrant flow'rs, A bevy Bright, with Minstrels meet, Spring from their darkling bow'rs: Their snowy limbs, their rosy smiles, Their locks of raven hue, Shadowing fair breasts, with am'rous wiles, 'Gan ev'ry heart subdue. “Ye whose consenting bosoms beat “To pleasure's soft alarms, “Here close your various search, and sate “Desire in Beauty's arms! “Ambition spread thine ermin'd pride! “Fame haunt the tented field, “Let guilt and power the world divide! “Love better joys can yield. “Here youthful dalliance, peace, and joy, “Crown'd with unfading prime, “Far from the changeful world's annoy, “Disport in native clime. “Come, taste the raptures of our bowl, “Your fruitless toils forego, “And we will bathe the charmed soul “In joys which Lovers know.” With magic lure the Sirens sung, Ambrose their guile defies, Arms with reproach his scornful tongue, And in disdain replies: “How vain is Beauty's gaudy flow'r, “The shadow of a shade! “Poor pageant of an idle hour, “Born just to bloom and fade. “How vainer still when modest Grace, “Which might the Sex adorn, “To Circe's wanton wiles gives place, “Transforming praise to scorn. “When beauty spreads deceitful snare, “Her vauntage to destroy, “Changing to thrall of pain and care “Her golden dreams of joy, “Be Faith and Truth our lasting prize! “Of female Worth the crown, “And Virtue chaste, which never dies, “When all your bliss is flown.” Sir Ambrose thus, with looks severe, Each turn'd his ling'ring steed, While whelm'd in shame and sad despair, False Beauty's bevy fled. CANTO III. Like bird from snare, with eager speed, O'er hill and dale they hie, Till, as the length'ning shades proceed, Fair bulwarks they espy. Orgus, for his renowned race, These rear'd on rising ground; A Baron He, with lordly grace, Rul'd in his rocky mound. Thither they bend; the ward on wall Gives summons where he sat; The porter, rous'd with clarion's call, Unfolds the stately gate. O'er circling moat the bridge is cast, The Knight, with trusty Squires, In marble court alights in haste, The lordly fort admires. The menial train, in order'd state, To hall of audience lead, Where Orgus, in his gorgeous seat, Bids the grave Stranger speed. In golden cups, the glitt'ring train Present the sparkling wine; And then, in story loud and vain, He talk'd of Rufus' line. Of Guendola, whose Ebran's fame Could salve the infamy Of thrones desoil'd by guilty blame, Cancell'd by chastity. Of Cambria's Prince, and Cymbelline, And Vortiger, with hive Of Saxons false, to undermine Those sweets which made them thrive. He talk'd of Locrine, Brutus' son, Of Albanact of old, From whom his noble lineage run, In line of Barons bold; And shew'd their feats, with blazon proud, Pourtray'd in Gothic hall, Their high descent, their royal blood, Unstain'd by foreign thrall. And now his splendid table stor'd With costly cheer and wine, Sir Ambrose, with this mighty Lord, Sits down in state to dine. His martial train apart repair, Their strength with travel worn; In the high stalls their coursers fare, O'er lib'ral heaps of corn. When flowing cups, with potent charm, Had wak'd the op'ning heart, Thus Orgus, with carousing warm, 'Gan secret thoughts impart. “I know thee well, Sir Ambrose thou! “Nor thy behest can hide; “Big with vain hope, you vainly woo “Bright Portia for your bride. “Thy mind what magic can inspire, “Where many a heart is lost, “There, with rash venture, to aspire, “Braving an unknown coast! “Or why thus through the world to roam, “In fruitless foreign chace, “When plumed honour, nearer home, “Shews with as fair a face! “Here Fame and Birth, like diamond store, “In golden links combin'd; “The sacred image all adore, “And art thou only blind!” “Blind let me be, so I prefer, “True Worth's unborrow'd shine; “For native Merit shames the glare “Of birth, like foreign mine.” “But I'll outmatch thee, Orgus said, “The Dame born to command “All hearts, Vanessa! thou shalt wed, “And with Her half my land.” “Ill fare the Knight, unworthy he “To gain such peerless prize: “Who would not sue on bended knee, “Where birth with merit vies. “And Ambrose here, with conscious pride, “Could act true lover's part, “Nor ever sue a worthier Bride, “Had Love not reft his heart: “For there's in Love imperial sway, “All vauntage to controul, “Of human boast, and thrall's her prey, “Prime magnet of the soul.” “But dangers lurk in every field,” Cries Orgus, big with wrath; “Bethink thee, in thy path, conceal'd, “Of ambush, war, and death.” “Nor ambush, war, nor death I dread,” Says Ambrose, with disdain, “When Portia is the victor's meed, “And life without her pain.” “Then go, unwise! from good to ill, “Thy rivals proud have sworn “Thy pains to soothe, thy blood to spil, “And shroud thy corse ere morn.” Sir Ambrose led his Yeomen bold, They cross the castle's mound In fair array; their horns of gold A fierce defiance sound. CANTO IV. Course on my trusty Friends with speed! While day shines in the sky, For ambush'd foes it is decreed Against our safety lie: And Orgus' Sons are of the plot To work a Rival's fall: May Heaven decide our destin'd lot, May snares the crafty thrall. Then o'er the fertile plain they flew, And o'er the whistling heath, And as the chearful sun withdrew, They slack their steeds to breath. When, bursting from the neighb'ring wood, A hostile troop drew near With clam'rous noise; in vengeful mood, Each couch'd his quiv'ring spear. “Yield Slaves, or die! Rombaldo cries, “Such was their Leader's name, “Vain your atchieve in knightly guise “To force our vaunted Dame: “Her Champions we! whose arms shall prove “Who best deserves the Fair, “And quell your rash aspiring love “In death, and black despair.” The boaster spoke; his squadron fierce Assails at his command, The trusty Yeomen bravely pierce Thrice through the vanquish'd band. Again their bloody toils renew, The glitt'ring faulchion's wound, The closing spears in shivers flew, And many press'd the ground. Unquell'd each frowning squadron stood, And now the mortal fray Had clos'd in gen'ral death, and blood; Beneath the setting ray: When Ambrose spoke, the rival Lord, And must our Yeomen die, And must the combat be restor'd For our proud rivalry. Let us alone the battle wage, To whom the spoils belong, Nor, in the barb'rous work of rage, Consume, this valiant throng. “Agreed! Rombaldo cries, and swore, “This javline shall decide “My rightful claim: In Ambrose gore “By arm of prowess dyed. And now the Chiefs, with lordly prance, Traverse the destin'd ground; And now they couch the quiv'ring lance At the shrill trumpet's sound: The Champions start; in mid carreer They meet with dread intent, The sounding mail repells the spear, The spears in shivers went. Again they turn, the falchion gleams To end their furious fight; Down Ambrose, arm the blood in streams Serves but to rouse his might. At the next charge, with vengeful speed Against his foe He flew; And headlong down, both Knight and steed, Groaning to earth he threw. Then seiz'd the pledge of his emprize, Rombaldo's helm and sword, And bids the band in scornful guise Replace their victor Lord. Nor stay'd; annon, Rombaldo's train In friendly arms prevail, To raise their Champion from the plain, Fainting in cumbrous mail. Meanwhile bright Portia in her Bow'r In fond retirement sat, And dream'd her Knight, all dangers o'er, Had drawn the prosp'rous fate. His am'rous vows the Lady bright Long heard, pure offering! What time the marine red cross Knight, Vanquish'd proud Iber's King. Her dreams, his Suit, with rivals proud Beset, awak'd the flame Of Virgin Love, in pleasing mood Pleading his juster claim. Each Suitor vain dismiss'd, aside, The per'lous lots She threw, For surer love a willing Bride In stronger fetters drew. Ambrose! course on thy prosp'rous way To Portia's stately tow'rs, Her little page, in trim array Conducts, while ev'ning lours. Propitious fate has stamp'd thy doom; With nuptial Bevy hies The blythsome Hymen to relume, His torch at Portia's eyes. And now the castle's blaze, afar, His am'rous journey guides, Grateful as ev'ning's golden star, When to his dome he glides. And now the watch, on turret high, Welcome Sir Ambrose Band, Full wide the ready portals fly, And in the Court they stand. But who can paint these Lovers true, Meeting in fond embrace! How when his per'lous march She knew, The roses left her face: How, when She saw her wounded Knight, She swoon'd, thro' pain and care! Like wreath of snow, from Arthur's height, He grasp'd the falling Fair. Anon restor'd, her female prime In fresher lustre shows, So smiles the Sun in southern clime, Thro' white, or damask rose. Her golden locks dishevell'd flow, Bright Venus' magic veil, And chaste affection's roseat glow, Sweet artifice! conceal. They lead the Knight, 'mid lustre's shine, To close his hours in rest, While, golden dreams of bliss divine His days with Portia bless'd. Apart She mourns; the rival sword Which caus'd a Lover's smart, Her iv'ry breast with pity gor'd, And pierc'd her maiden heart. Bless'd Pair! whom gentlest sates conjoin, Not chance nor treasur'd store; Thrice happy Knight! who gains a mine Richer than worlds of ore. The harmless pleasures, side by side, Lead on the jocund hours, And Constancy with Love ally'd, Frequent their Nuptial Bow'rs. Like Two fair Trees with blossoms crown'd, The glory of the grove, They spread their golden Branches round, The Fruits of faithful Love. The fields rejoice, the smiling vale, Where winding Fortha strays: Whose village maids the pleasing tale Repeat to future days. Banks of Forth, 1785. CURSORY THOUGHTS IN THE S????y of the Ab??y. INSCRIBED TO ANDREW CROSBIE, ESQ. ADVOCATE, VICE-DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF ADVOCATES, F. R. S. OF EDINBURGH, AND OF THE SOCIETY OF SCOTTISH ANTIQUARIES, WHOSE EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE, AND EMINENT ABILITIES, BOTH AS LEARNED COUNSEL, AND AT THE BAR, REFLECT DIGNITY AND LUSTRE AROUND THOSE SHINING GOOD QUALITIES, WHICH ADORN SOCIETY, WHICH DISTINGUISH THE HUMANE, THE DISINTERESTED, AND MANLY CHARACTER. Tantæne animis cælestibus iræ! ? Virg. Ye Regal Seats! where native Monarchs sway'd, When Scotia's fame, triumphant as her sword, Pervaded every clime, nor swelling pride Of haughty Normans circumscrib'd her state; To you I fly, ordain'd, in better days, Meet refuge for the friendless, when the rod Of guilt triumphant, in this iron age, Bears down the Juster Cause: Propitious hide, In circle of your sanctuary, the son, Outcast, forlorn, a stranger to the tear Which Pity gives to Misery, full oft The only mite here left her to bestow. Perhaps he bends beneath Misfortune's rain, Or faithless friends, like parricides, pursue, In howling pack; or sad reverse of trade, Or dire mischance of ocean, fire, or storm, Has ever shipwreck'd on the sea of life, With all his clamant children; or the snares Of gen'rous surety, plunder'd for his friend. Nor waste, nor luxury, nor costly schemes Of grasping avarice, with loss repaid, Has made them poor: The Destiny which rules O'er all, which, smiling, fills our flowing cup With each endearing sweet, or, frowning stern, With stepdame's eye, refuses ev'ry good Her fav'rites share, 'tis this which casts their lot, The rich man's portion, purple, feast, and song, While patience starves, or bends beneath the weight Of sickness, want, reproach; Perhaps the bent, The sacred biass of a gen'rous soul, Like Heav'n, dispensing bliss, who gives, and feels For others, goodness far surpassing self, And every selfish view, beyond the sphere Of fortune, narrow for their lib'ral mind, Has brought them, venerable exiles, here, To seek that refuge once they freely gave, Which now they lack themselves. Set wide your gates, Thou hallow'd asylum! and save the good, The just, the gen'rous, from vindictive fang Of sordid Avarice, of Justice stern, Inexorable, deaf to Mercy's cry. Let not th'illustrious Friend to mis'ry lack The cordial sympathy he once bestow'd On all distress'd: Oh! may he never feel These woes, which villain luxury prepares, With cruel thoughtless insult, to o'erwhelm The hoary head of age. Let not the chains Of wanton guilt, or malice, mark the limbs Of poor misfortune, like a felon dragg'd 'Mid treason, murder, perj'ry, to a jail, Depriv'd of air, of liberty, and link'd With such society their soul abhors, And pleas'd, recoils upon itself. Near may The legal privileged ruffian, he, Whose gorgon visage stamp'd for blackest deeds, Speaks gibbets, death, and Erebus, profane Thy holy threshold with defilement vile Of unbless'd feet: Nor e'er his scrols unfold, In sacrilegious mockery of the law, With licenc'd outrage, to invade man's right: Safe, in thy magic circle may they dwell Remote from all annoy: Sweet slumbers close Their careful eyes: Sweet may the red breast sing Beneath their lattice, to the orient blaze Of golden morn, and smiling health, and peace, Virtue's fair sisters, lead them thro' the haunts Of moral contemplation, till the powers, The guardian Genii of these walls, conjoin'd With mild Astræa, set the prisoners free. Within your peaceful precincts, kind receive Th'unshelter'd head, long struggling with the storm Of Life's rude ocean: By confederate strife Of Parents, Brothers, Kindred, oh! despoil'd Of every right: Yet from the list'ning bar Of judgment turning, sham'd to plead a cause Of helpless Orphans, nature shrinks to hear. O public insult to humanity! Trembling with heart-felt agony to speak The horrid tale; which tears the finest chords, The tortured, nicely feeling frame within; While silent, suff'ring patience, bleeds convuls'd On sharpest rack. Compar'd with this, the worst Of mortal plagues, which nature 'gainst herself Arms inwardly, how calm th'instructed mind, Exalted in its peace, may stand the shock Of common evils, welcome every round Of fickle fortune, brave the Lordly frown Of tyrant greatness, who disdains to hear The poor man's cause, or, impious, overturns, Like swelling Pharoah, mid his lyar train Of flatt'ry vile, meet levee for mean pride. Well may they bear, unmov'd, the restless toil Of carping envy, hostile still to good, Or secret malice, with her fiend-like arts, Sly, undermining every honest praise: The scoff of brutal ignorance, the scorn Of fools, and knavish outlaws, the foul pride Of rank hypocrisy, who boastful talks Of God, and vaunted faith, and love divine, Yet impious, in the afflicted's case, defies All works of love, the God of love ordains, And disapprove their passport from high bliss, Aliens to good rejected. Scorn the trade, The slav'ry mean of many a dastard heart, Who bears on high the shameless front, nor spares To revel on the wreck such hirelings make; The plagues of a bad world, the tools of pride, The slaves of pampar'd luxury: No care, No honest toil they know, save to complete The little tyrant's knavish plan who rules Despotic o'er some paultry spot: These moil, By hellish fraud and art'fice, to ensnare The freeborn, and enchain them to the yoke, Which galls their liberty, bends their spirit down, And moulds them for submission: The fearless few Of virtues train, who cross the little strides Of pigmy power, as bravest cruelly feel The scourge which levels man. Ye abject slaves! Of tyranny, who work another's will, And basely serve your own, go sink the scale Of widows, orphans, and the poor man's lot, Heavy at best: Ye div'lish hirelings! lift O'er them the proud, the insolent, the scum, The dross of earth, to keep them low: Employ Your guileful, plotting, scoundrel train, renown'd For every vice, when Fiends possession take, And urge on man's damnation. Haste! devour The poor, the widow's house, the orphans spare, And sacred portion; what the ruffian bands Of harden'd outlaws, roving pirates arm'd, Or private robbery, not so deep in crimes, Had spar'd, remorseful, to the pension'd roll Of crying want and age. Then all t'ensure The speedy fall of Him, whose soul abhores Such cruel deeds, whose tearful eyes o'erflow For wrongs he cannot cure, who braves the wrath Of plodding sly deceit, who thwarts bold vice, Who stands forth in the gape such Demons make; Go! Bribe the abandon'd, tempt the perjur'd down The yawning gulphs of horror! loose each tye, Each fear, each curb, each sacred bond which chains All social life, to truth, to honesty, To just, and right, to man, and to his God, And to enforce mean vengeance, damn mankind! HAIL princely domes! fair mansions of our kings, Whose structure proud, with high embattled tow'rs And antique galleries, and pillard state, Does sooth the pensive melancholy thought: Whose cloyster'd walls and holy fanes decayed, Majestic yet in ruin, steal the soul From sad remembrance of these evil times, To happier thoughts of golden Ages past, Unstain'd with modern crimes. To you I call, And to your wildy pleasing solitudes Of rocks, and dales, and mountains hoar, beneath Whose verdant sides the goodliest prospect lies, Of princely seats in fair arrange, of woods, And pastures green, of chrystal lakes, and seas, Unbounded, graced with many a gliding sail; And distant hills, and high Edina crown'd With lofty spires, and maiden towers, which deck In Gothic majesty the lengthning scene: Oft let me trace with frequent foot your wilds, What time gay morning dawns, or ev'ning hour To contemplation, tunes the pensive mind. Your solemn echos to the ear of night, And thousand wakeful fires, her listning guard, Shall oft repeat, in lib'ral verse my Song, In numbers unpremeditate. Apart, Secure, in refuge of your ivy'd rocks, And pendant mountains hoar, I round survey The crowding urbane landscape: Oft at noon Look down on all the busy tribes below With philosophic eye. Ye gaudy trains! Of plummed peagentry, who idly cross Life's jostling path, say! What's the vain avail Of all your endless labours! The vain shew Of useless wealth and greatness! Death concludes The narrow race, and on the mimic group And hurrying player, shuts the changeful scene. Ye purse-proud citizens! who bustling raise Yon dusty clouds, annoyance to the poor, The harmless, useful schemes of honest trade, Which builds, which props the fabric of the State, When will tir'd Av'rice, not grasping more, Leave their just portion to the crowds who starve! Like the Behemoth, bask in sunny clime, Your vaunted strength, along the willowy shore, Draining the rivers tide, which freely flows, Refreshing far the plain, till swilling lust Of selfish Mammon desolate the scene. Good Genii! unrolling human lot, With kindliest biass, who enchain the Fiends Malignant, only active to infuse Their swelling spleen empois'ning Nature round, Oh! save us from the plagues Yon Felons shed, Pandora's box, with deadliest bane renew'd. See! where with haggard lip and corse deform! Meet dwelling for such Wretch, thro' life he steals, Defrauding his staunch creditor, the grave, That felon, Faustus, with his dev'lish arts, Ensnaring widows, orphans, to devour Their sacred pittance, or with Turpin rob The hives industrious, in disdain of law; The Necromancers skulk 'mid Honour'd Train, Who shun the Scoundrels, and as hell abhor. In contemplation's solitudes remote, Oh! hid me from yon ruthless group, who turn Aside from misery, and fiend-like shut The doors of mercy, while misfortune mourns The scourge of vice. Ye lordly drones! vile group Of pride and meanness, who consume the hive, The stores of thousands, on your idle train, Squand'ring in cruel riot, what might bless Some sober families, who pine in want, Roll on in selfish, pamper'd sloth, and shove Yon friendless bankrupt from the path, attir'd In weeds uncouth, unpity'd and forlorn. See how apart he shuns the meas'ring eye Of strutting insolence, and wipes the tear Which modest worth and honesty, depress'd, Oft consecrate to deck the shrine of pride. So in yon mountain wild, the wounded deer His bleeding stound apart bewails, and shuns The boyant ranging herd: In sportive ease, As taught by cruel man, whose thoughtless mirth Insults the wretched, struggling with their fate, The trooping quarry with consent avoid Their helpless brother, and full lordly pass Their fellow-outcast, while mute patience bears The gen'ral scorn, the dow'r of misery, And sighs his pangs to the deep shelt'ring shade. Ye Sisters Nine! who held your fav'rite haunt, In days of yore, in these fair regal seats, Your peaceful residence, with footsteps pure, Oh! say, for to your hallow'd ken reveal'd All nature lies: Is vice, with brazen front, And fearless stride, o'erleaping ev'ry bound, A Fiend let loose to domineer on earth, Because the laws are impotent to curb, Unable to subdue the lawless pest, Bent on foul deeds, inhuman and accurs'd, On earth establishing the works of hell? Say is the evil world, like fell disease, Which daily gathers increase, bad and worse, Incurable! Has virtue, in the eye Of human race, once lovely, kind, and pure From ev'ry blemish, name and nature lost, Congenial with the skies, and, sad reverse, Put on the demon form of loathsome, foul, Of bloated spite, fierce insolence, of power Gigantic monster! with a hundred hands, To do a thousand black abhorred deeds, Which make all hell rejoice, and ravage earth, Their waste abode, meet dwelling for such Fiends. Are all things chang'd for worse! That inward light, That charity, pure truth, and sacred faith 'Twixt man and man, have names without existence, As sounds taught children. In the schools we learn Of these eulogium high, and vaunted phrase, And from the bar, and pulpit, their acclaim With zealous orat'ry proceeds: Alas! These only empty names, mere echo sounds; A voice and nothing more remains of thee, Thou radiant angel Virtue! Heav'n's first born, Her loveliest, dearest child! No stranger once On earth, in Paradise, to eye of man Once passing fair. Abroad into the world, Walk forth, 'tis all a dream: What schoolmen teach, The libertine crowd decry, with hissing scorn. Hypocrisy, mean Atheist, thee abjures, For sordid ends, and triumphs in his gain, Tho' coward Conscience blame his losing trade. Masking in sacred garb, with semblance starch Of ev'ry holy Grace, of Mild and Meek, Vile counterfeits! when sacerdotal Pride, Hypocrisy, to varnish cruel guile, And the revengeful Villain lurks beneath, How many Achans, fir'd with Atheist love Of the accursed thing, now fawn on pow'r, And proudly lord it o'er God's Heritage, O'erleaping ev'ry bound: Unseemly league! To work their tyrant purpose, to forsake Their altars, and their oracles of peace, Apostate Traitors! with satannic zeal, Wide humbling man, to build proud Phar'o's scheme: To crush the friendless, to bear down the scale Of public liberty, abhorred tools Of guilty pow'r! Mean troublers of our peace! Whom Heav'n shall vex with tenfold plagues return'd. Ye grov'ling cringing slaves! worst shame of all Th'apostate Eldership! Oh! hide your heads, Lest the pure light withdraw its holy beam, Prophan'd by monstrous sights: Oh! hide your heads Before the Lord of Conscience, He, who tries The treasons of the times, with awful search Pervading Solyma, with godlike ken Of eyes all-seeing, as with candle's flame, Or blazing torch, to shew th'accursed thing Which causeth Judah stumble, each false friend Who only lurks in Zion to betray. What legion Demons, quitting nobler game, Could tempt such fawning dastards to destroy The Church's discipline! to sell their faith For Judas' paltry barter! with rude force, To rend that adamantine hallow'd bond, Th'eternal chain the Church o'er Satan holds, And Belial's sons; the chain which binds your souls: But you have sold them, instruments of crimes, To slavish villainy, to tyrant pow'r, To a remorseless Bigot, who betrays The Church, the Public, and the charter'd rights Of Freemen sold, to build his grov'ling scheme. Within your midnight secret Popish pale Of partial select Ses????, pack'd in haste, Go plead for dire abortion, murder, crimes Which want a name: Send forth suborned proofs, Bandied about by sensual parasites, By shameless Matrons, outlaws, knaves, and fools, Falsehood's black wiles enroll'd! the Devil's voice, Against all truth, all conscience, and all law! Mean scoundrels, go! and from unhallow'd den Of perjury and treason ne'er disclos'd, Save when the gulphs of Tophet dire disgorge Their rankness to pollute the world with crimes, Send lustful dalliance forth, swoll'n tyrant pride, O'erleaping ev'ry bound; with Athiest train Of policy, or Hell's black plagues in one; Yon d???? V???? to infect the age With habitude unclean. The Cherub face Of sacred Childhood scapes not leudness fang, Which shelt'ring in the refuge of rank wiles, Embolden'd by the purest, chast reserve, Foully invaded Heav'n. Oh! hide your head, Thou purest Sun! nor shine on Villain deeds, The Muses will not speak, nor Shame declare. Ah! tell it not in Gath! the hoary scape Of rev'rend Elders, like Susanna's twain, Commixes with the sacrilegious group Of Belial and proud Eli's sons; seduce, By impious suff'rance, unguarded youth To revelry and rape: With Hell's defile Prophane each holy sanctuary, and seat Leud sons of Satan with the sons of God. And when your cup o'erflows, in honest minds Inkindling indignation, Fiends abash'd Appal'd in triple shades shall joyous deem Their Guilt, and Judas by your crimes out done, Who, boasting vows and offerings of peace, Do pious homage only to betray, Trampling on dreadful Mysteries. In scorn Of all, and reeking from the sensual stye Of drunkenness, go! bring your Champion forth! With Athiest profanation, with disdain Of holiest things, insulting God and Man, His grace divine, the crimson streams which flow Around his dreadful Altar, schemes of love To man eternal, by base man prophan'd; Go! seat your champion at the Royal Feast, And while all Israel troubl'd deep complain With uproar's voice, yon grov'ling slavish tribe Of Levites, Rulers, Apostates, shall draw O'er all oblivion's viel. Bold sinners know Th'all-seeing Judge, who reigns enthron'd in light Numbers your secret thoughts, your evil deeds, Against the dread Assize. Hot burning wrath Avenging his own cause, devour'd the seats Of Korah's Usurpation: Plung'd in death Those shrieking rebels, in the gulphs of pride: This Nadab with unhallow'd fire consum'd, And melted Sinais' rocky heights convuls'd, And all the sacrilegious. Trembling, fear! This burning Tophet, roaring for her prey! Forbid it all ye gracious Powers, who watch O'er Man's apostacy! such group should spring From laws too feeble, to restrain the floods Of bold iniquity, that preys on man: The laws are wisely fram'd, the tables pure, Where Justice, Wisdom, Truth, with finger dread, Are fairly writ, that ev'ry eye may see Where duty draws us, ev'ry inward thought May tremble to transgress: Corruption's plague, With influence malign, invades the spheres, And bloats the sun, and taints the inward light, Once rational, to resist that sanction high, Connected still with universal good, To Man observant, but with penal force To hold in awe offenders, to ensure Obedience, till o'er the flaming arch The Sapphire throne descend, and trumpet voice Of heaven's dread Justice' peal the last Assize. Nor is mankind so lost, so dead to sense, To feelings fine of virtue, and her praise, So blind to Nature's light, as to disdain What's honest, pure, and true. A pow'r in all, The umpire Conscience, delegate of heaven, Internal Monitor, the voice of God, Points ev'ry upright path we take in life; Unerring guide, as magnet to the pole: The written tables, fenc'd with terrors dread, Of Thunder and of Justice' edged sword, Constraining Man to Man, to Heaven, to God, Enforce on all with sovereign sanction firm. Yet is there vast defect, if lawful thus To name such monstrous evil; pregnant long With gross corruption, present, and to come; The Shame, the Bane, the Bravo of our state, Who opens mines of wickedness unknown, When Pagans, Goths, and Saracens bore rule: Or Antichrist vile Man of lies, and sin, Reign'd uncontroul'd in fiery wrath, and spread Hell's desolation thro' the works of God. Justice with hand impartial weighs the cause Twixt Man and Man, and hence between the signs Of heav'ns high concave, blaze her golden scales. And just the praise of him in quest of right, Who scorning vile chicanery of law, The guise of varnish'd falsehood, hateful trade! Of Knaves, who cheat and spoil at Justice feet, While he Misfortune's friend, thro' ev'ry maze Impartial, active, guides to center true The polar point where only Truth does lie, His aim unveiling Falshood, not to hide. For with unhallowed foot, with guileful haste, And eager vissage keen, to push a trade Against the peace of all, or right or wrong, Some wealthy felon, or some orphan'd train, His fraud, his wiles, his villain wrongs oppress; To him the same, just or unjust no care Of plund'ring Turpin, train'd to merc'less deeds, Of licenc'd villainy, the Pirate bent On rapine, marks his prey, and thro' the maze Of writs unnumber'd lengthening as they wind The fatal labyrinth, with high encrease Of number, subject, value, as the leaves Of the Cumean Maid, he leads them on, An Ignis Fatuus, 'mid the pits of death, Devoted to destruction: Thrice hapless proof, Corruption reigns o'er all, when justest cause Of good men is perverted at the will, The nod of every Outlaw, when the wrong'd Must suffer rapine, in pursuit of right, And vaunted Justice bleeds by her own sword; While fell Tresilian stamps the firm decree, And weeping Mercy, with averted eye, Turns from the bench of law, whose impure stain, From Foulest Channels loudly pleads redress. Ah! see yon guilty train of conscious Knaves, Who trembling, stand abash'd, the sacred light Within them, waking keen remorse, and woes They cannot speak; for those are they who sold The just man's cause, who sold a Briton's Rights, Subourned tools of faction! Their good name, Their Friends', Instructors', all their worldly share Of present good they prize; and better hopes, Bartered of heavenly bliss, the meanest scorn Of all the damn'd: Who, gracious Powers, defend From Hell's delusion, by most solemn oath, Did seal their impious bargain, wrecking all, That man holds dear; and, in the phrensy'd mood Of clam'rous faction, deaf to every voice, Her own except; braving the yawning gulph Of dread hereafter. Ah! Thrice remorseless band, Befool'd of all, by a mean scoundrel snar'd, And taught his rebel purposes, encag'd, A nest of birds unclean. Lo, yonder chair Of judgment, where Astræa once more would Descend, did not a false Prov? Judge, O Sacrilege abhord! usurp the seat, A better's right, by partial decrees stain'd, Injust, absurd, mere insolence of pow'r, The scoff of lowest intellects, the scorn Of School-boys, and their theme for low contempt. Just powers! who love mankind, defend the free, The brave, the wrong'd, who friendless in such strife, Outface the meaness of a Jeffries vile, Who sacrilegous, sold law, conscience, soul, To work politic Tyrants will: To plead Excuse for perj'ry, for treason base, For every vice which gradual mining saps, A nation's life; which tramples on the right, The Briton's charter'd privilege to be heard, And fully heard, against a Demon fell, Who wants a name, 'ere B? sentence pass. Thrice holy walls! Whose desolated pile, And storied mansions mould'ring to decay, Scarce serve to shield the mighty dead intomb'd From proud annoy, ye Princes! Monarchs! laid, With factious peers, once troublers of your peace, Beneath one common marble Ah! how vain Your faded grandeur, your once high estate, Your titl'd peerage, the full blaze of pow'r, The tide of fortune the rich pomp of pride, Now shriv'ld in the dust. Your Trophied Gates, Your Ample Courts, once throng'd with cavalcades Of pageant state, of flattery base, intent, To rise by early adulation; these Avail no more, nor in historic page, Can save your mem'ry from the tonchstone proof Of candid speculation, from keen pen Of satyr dread, or bigots wanton rage. 'Tis now your vanity and pride must feel, The curse of being great; and deep convinc'd, Yield to the challeng'd, sharp, tormenting proof, That every toil is vain, save Wisdom's, she Who trains man to the noblest end of life, The life of God and virtue, which survives, When all your Crowns and Palaces decay, And heaven's bright starry mansions sink in night. The gaudy sun is sunk, the Maiden Towers Shine to the crimson'd sky: The solemn hour Of closing evening, leads me to lament At Julia's Tomb; there strew the latest flowers Which fading autumn yields. Hail! holy shrine Good Genii haunt; where fancy's eye does trace Heroic Shades, and Kindred Chiefs, and Saints Encrown'd, who leave their Amaranthine bowers To visit thy cold relicts in the tomb. Thou! once the first in bloom of youth! the pride Of Scotia's beauteous dames; the first, the hope Of Douglas princely Line, the first in worth, And in the gloom of adverse fortune train'd, The first in misery: Say, is there not, Some blest reversion in the sky, for those Who drink the cup of bitterness! entomb'd, O teach prime Moralist! The Rich, the Great, That true nobility ne'er dwelt in blood, Or lineage high! that graceful She resides, Where worth and valour shine, and Public Love, That angel flame, which like the fire Prometheus He stole, Exalts the hero, dignifies the pride Of Princes, Statesmen, in whom mercy smiles, To Shield th'unshelter'd head. Look from they sphere, To guard thy offspring from the fatal snares Which haunt the great! look with a Mother's eye Upon their princely League, and build thine House, Amid connubial virtue: May the fame Of heroes, patriots, Scott, and Douglas rise, In them, renew'd with glory: May the smiles, Th'enchanting love of Providence, embrace Thy numerous progeny: Oh! deign to hear In thy high sphere this request; if the care Of faithful vassalage in wrongs long tryed, Can reach immortals, may the helpless race Who clamant, croud the lowly plunder'd shed Of him, whose melting heart in sorrow bleeds, In want unfriended, 'mid the worst of Wrongs, Find kindly refuge from oppressive Pow'r: Or if ordain'd to mourn, thus sooth each pang; Our poverty Once sav'd our Master's House. THE INGENIOUS AND LEARNED M? GRAY, Then republishing his beautiful Lyric Poems. O thou! high seated on the muses hill! Possessing Phoebus' lyre and Phoebus' skill; Whether from the lofty steep you boldly sing, Or crop fresh roses by the sacred spring, Or quaff the stream, while Fancy to thine eyes, Bids Nature's charms in heav'nly vision rise; To grace thy Song, to steal the ravish'd heart, To wake the Virtues, and their Joys impart: Accept, O Gray! the humble wreath I bring, Tune my rude reed and teach me how to sing. Teach me like thee to gain the willing soul, By Moral Truth, and Music's soft controul! Above the great, above the world to rise, Prometheus like, and borrow of the skies. Teach me the Shafts of malice to malice to deride, The tooth of envy, and the frown of pride; Secure from ills that vex the rich and great, To sail life's ocean in a lowly state. Not selfish, as amidst its storm I steer, To hide mine eyes from mis'ry's falling tear; But bless'd to cheer the gloom of sad despair, To hear the orphan's and the widow's pray'r; To sooth their pangs, unfold Religion's plan, Weep o'er their woes, and know myself a man. Dysart, 1768. ON THE MEMORABLE SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR, Where the Gallant GENERAL ELLIOT with his brave Garrison, for many months baffled all all the power of Spain, and in her final defeat, by the distruction of the Floating Batteries, won immortal laurels. ? Elliotusne exurere classem, Cantabricam, ipsos que potuit submergere ponto, Unius ob noxam, et furias! ? Virg. Triumphant Victors! o'er the pride of Spain, Who like the Bands of Asia, did sustain The war of nations, and their wrathful mood, Quench'd in red deluges of fire and blood: While Classic Muses deeds heroic sing, Admit, ye brave! the humble wreaths I bring, To hang your Tow'rs, and deck your glitt'ring Arms, In peaceful Trophies, pil'd from war's alarms. Long share the treasur'd sweets your valour won, Those Laurels which the bravest have out-done: Unequal'd conduct, patient courage, join'd With arts defensive to resist mankind. The length'ning leaguer, danger, famine, death, Brave Souls! defying with your latest breath: The British Goddess on the heights of fame, With blazon high inrolls her Soldier's name: Elliot, with blooming mural garlands crown'd, While Calpes bulwarks grace Herculean mound. With thunders roar thy midnight light'ning's glare, Devour whole hosts, and rack the groaning air. Like dire Vesuvius hid in fiery clouds, Thy Rocky Mortars whelm the hostile crouds, With show'rs of Lava, from the mountain's womb, In gulphs of sire whole armies to entomb. 'Mid bursting horrors, see what hosts expire! What floating Castles sink in seas of fire! Bourbon! thy glories shrink, the pride of Spain Founders in tempest, 'mid the burning main. So sunk the proud in that destructive hour When vain Cantabria hasten'd to devour With mooned fleets, and hosts, and tyrant faith, A dragon Monster, fierce for works of death. Like Erebus impatient for their prey, The arm of Heaven dash'd their vast array. Her valiant Sons, like northern tempest, came, Their fleets to scatter, and the dragon tame: Resistless, fierce to meet their country's foe, Her Sons of glory strike the mortal blow; Arm'd with fierce flames, Armada's pomp o'erthrew, As Michael's might the Pandemonian crew. So, while embattl'd nations rage in vain, The Queen of Isles sits Sovereign of the Main: Her Sons, the thunder in her hand, are hurl'd, Like the loud storm which shakes a guilty world. In fields of blood Cantabria's hosts expire, And vaunting navies sink in gulphs of fire. St Salvator's College, St Andrew's, 1782. SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF MAJOR ANDRE. Et bello audacis populi vexatus et armis, Finibus extorris, complexu avulsus Iulæ, Auxilium imploret videatque indigna suorumque Funera: nec, cum se Lodovico pactu iniquo Tradiderit, regno, aut optata luce fruatur; Sed cadat ante diem, mediaque inhumatus arena. If dying Patriots claim a nation's tear, If civic Worth be yet to Britain dear, If public Love and loyal Zeal bequeath, By Goths devoted to a felon's death, Immortal fame; her herald voice shall sound His deathless praise, till every shore rebound: Till Nature's theme celestial spheres reply Of Andre, for his Country doom'd to die. Thrice loyal! brave! Gem in barbaric clime! Where every grace adorns thy youthful prime; And civic Worth her splendors bright displays, Till ruthless Traitors quench'd thy diamond blaze, And all thy treasures to the Furies gave, While madd'ning demons dig thine early grave. With every private public virtue blest! With thee thy Country's choicest wishes rest. What tho' no trophied pile thine ashes keep, Where Britain's Hero might entombed sleep: What tho' no scutcheon'd arch adorn the place, Where guilt and greatness only oft disgrace The pride of Art: the Sov'reign of the main And fearless Freedom weep, thy guardian Train. Thro' future times her warrior Youth shall come, Their arms to burnish at her Soldier's tomb: While Britain sad, reclining on her spear, With Mother's grief bewails her Andre's bier: On bleeding heart inscribes the deathless name, Her Son's best monument to live to fame: And ever turning, where in hallow'd shade, By haunted stream her fearless Chief is laid; In Fancy's ear laments with wailing cries, “On yonder shore my clay-cold Andre lies.” THE INVASION. Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus Nigræ feraci frondes in Algido, Per damna, per cædes, ab ipso Ducit opes animumque ferro. Hor. in Drus. Where her deep foundations hiding, 'Neath the foaming western waves, Lordly Mona tow'rs deriding Storms which tear th'Eolian caves, On chrystalline throne suspended O'er the deep in dazzling state, Britain's Goddess shone attended By her Train, which faithful wait: Lion fortitude protending Ægis fell, and dreadful spear; Freedom's dauntless form contemning Dangers, death, and giant fear: Wisdom, justice, might, resembling Th'awful Pow'rs who rule the pole, With adamantine chain assembling Public Love, who binds the whole. From her chair imperial bending, Set with diamonds orient vien, Thus, the sov'reign Pow'r descending, Loud bespeaks her native main. Hear ye subject deeps of Ocean! Circling this terrestrial ball, Fate who rules each dire commotion, Bids you rest from foreign thrall. The annals of the former as well as of the late war are emblazon'd with records of the most signal national deliverances, and brilliant victories over the numerous fleets and armies of France. No time can erase the memory of the glorious service done his country, when the magnanimous Sir Edward Hawke encountered and subdued the powerful fleets of Bourbon, equipped for the invasion and destruction of the British nation. While we glory in the name and prerogative of free Britons, the important overthrow of the common enemy of our religious liberty, accomplished under the immediate direction of divine providence, must be engraven on our hearts in the very deepest characters of gratitude and praise: And more especially as the discomfiture of an enraged and disappointed enemy brings to our remembrance the awful catastrophe of another Armada (in that age of heroism) whose signal overthrow, at that critical time, was the everlasting renown of the English navy, as it was in a most eminent degree the supreme safety and deliverance of these nations. But these atchievement of true heroism have been recorded by much abler pens; I consine myself to the northern invasion. With manifest design to devide the force, to distract the attention of Britain from making a suitable resistance, while M. Conflans spread terror and desolation over the southern coasts of England, M. Thurot was appointed by express commission from the French King to disturb the eastern coasts of Scotland, the northern and western islands, and to land his troops in some of the remote districts, as should appear most eligible at the time. After a long delay, M. Thurot succeeded at last in getting into the north seas with his squadron, which had been blocked up for many weeks by twenty sail of British men of war. Thurot's fleet consisted of the Marshal Belleisle of 48 guns, 600 men, the Begon of 36 guns, 600 men, La Blonde 36 guns, 400 men, La Terpsichore 24 guns, 230 men, La Marante 24 guns, 140 men. This armament took on board a select draught of troops from five different regiments. It was furnished with 168 guns, with 900 sailors, and with 1270 soldiers, draughted from the Swiss guards, from the corps of Hussars, and the light armed companies about Dunkirk. The rumour of such an armament, so completely furnished, was sufficient to disturb the peace of a country entirely defenceless towards the north, alarming apprehensions were entertained of their destination, and Commodore Boice watched their motions, with a large fleet of men of war, and followed their course as far north as Aberdeen. After collecting from the islands of Orkney what could then be had of provisions, they sailed for the western islands about the end of January 1760: There they landed in a few days, and continued two weeks victualling their little fleet. M. Thurot was of the greatest service to the gentlemen of Ilay, to John Campbell of Ardmac, to Mr M'Donald, and Mr M'Neil, in procuring payment to the inhabitants for meal, flour, and cattle. Particularly, he behaved in the most generous and honourable manner, obliging the land-officers to lay down all the gold they had, and to give draughts for the remainder on the King's Bank at Paris. Some officers had been so mean as to cheat the people with mock bills on the resident at the Hague; but this was severely remonstrated against by M. Thurot, whose deportment was in every respect most honourable, like a soldier. When by consent they had agreed to burn and waste the whole country, he brought from his desk the commission from the French King, which expressly declared against hostilities unless resisted; and when some appeared yet by their looks refractory, he swore in great indignation, that not a soul of them should set foot again aboard the Marshal Belleisle who should commit the least trespass upon the friendly and defenceless inhabitants of the western islands. Bourbon's vasty fleets alarming, Plough no more th'indignant wave: Tyrant pow'r her miriad's arming, No more threatens to enslave. In her vanquish'd Conflans flying, Proud France bows her dragon pride: And the crimson'd billows dying, Seeks her coward shame to hide. See her vaunted lilies drooping, Once ador'd by myriad slaves, To the British lion stooping, Sink amid th'exulting waves. 'Bove the boast of fall'n greatness, Britain tow'rs her laurel'd head, To enchain the scepter'd traitress, By the heav'nly fates decreed. See the nations wide exulting, Triumph in haughty Bourbon's fall: Pow'r and pride with scorn insulting, “These no more the world enthral.” All to guard the realms of Ocean, From Invasion's grasping chain, Watching warlike Thuro's motion, Here I range my guardian train. While the youth of France confiding Vainly in unnumber'd band, With their fleets the ocean hiding, Hasten to devour the land; Thuro bold, with host of warriors, Firm resistance to divide, For the Hyperborean barriers, Ploughs the raging wint'ry tide. He his thronging cohorts cheering, “Death or conquest is the prize,” 'Mid rude storms and billows steering, Bravely Kingdoms three defies. Ilay's verdant shores alarming, Yet a mild, a gen'rous foe; Eiren's northern port disarming, Hark! his horns brief triumph blow. See! his fleet, in vaunting glory, Back explores proud Bourbon's coast; Fancy speaks his boastful story, Soon by Elliot's squadron cross'd. Here I watch, and here the valiant, Who 'mid winds and billows toil, Shall encounter Thuro gallant, All his short-liv'd trophies soil. Thus the Goddess: Soon her thunder O'er the echoing surge rebounds; Banner'd terrors, fear, and wonder Soon the trembling deep confounds. Warlike Thuro, greatly daring, Fires his vet'rans for the fight; In the front, the Hero warring, Braves the rage of mortal might. All to meet on burning ocean, Britain's champions fearless lead, Elliot He! 'mid dire commotion, Ever first in van to bleed. Hark! the battle wildly raging, Sulphur, horror, death, and fire, Martial Chiefs with Chiefs engaging, 'Mid the mangled heaps expire. O'er the gory decks bestriding, Carnage, horror, death prevail; Wild dismay in tempest riding, Wide the troubled waves assail. 'Mid the mortal onset charging, Mark the fearless Thuro's cry! Thus his fainting mates enraging, “We must conquer, or must die.” “Glorious laurels homeward bearing M. Thurot landed at Carricfergus about a thousand troops: The town was without walls, and garrisoned by 180 new recruits, who, without ammunition, most obstinately defended the gate with their fixed bayonets. The Old Castle, in whose wall was a breach of 50 feet, capitulated with the town. The French there lost near 100 men, and again embarked on some sudden information, after carrying off the arms and necessaries from the Royal Magazine. Upon the first tidings of the enemy being at Carricfergus, Commodore Elliot sailed in the Eolus, with the Pallas and Brilliant of 36 guns each, and in two days came up with the French squadron off the Isle of Man. The engagement continued near four glasses, and was obstinate, bloody, and decisive. They were all captured, the Marshal Belliesle commanded by M. Thurot, the La Blonde by Captain La Kayce, and the Terpsichore by Captain Dufraudais. The gallant M. Thurot fighting bravely to the last, and encouraging his men, was unfortunately slain. The engagement having been continued closely and for so long a time, the slaughter on board the French ships was a perfect carnage: Amid the undistinguished mass of mangled bodies, the corpse of the brave commander was thrown over board with others. The public thanks was decreed by the Irish House of Commons, to Commodore Elliot and the other Captains with him, but the joy of all ranks was clouded by the death of Thurot; so far had the humane and generous conduct of an enemy gained upon the impartial sensations of mankind. Some days after, the body of Thurot was cast ashore near Wigton, and being known by his dress and by some certain particular marks, was interred in the church-yard of Sorbay. A monument was erected over his grave, and his portrait engraven in copper, by subscription., “Our rich freight in battle won; “Striplings these proud honours tearing! “Shall the bravest be outdone! “Death with glory is the measure, “Partial fate bestows the brave, “Grant Just Pow'rs! the soldiers treasure, “Conquest, or a glorious grave.” Where a thousand fates were flying, Thuro bleeding urg'd the strife, Desperate, and bent on dying, Amid slaughter scorning life. “Spare the Bravest! Elliot charges “Ev'ry warrior, spare the Brave! “Where the mortal combat rages “Fly ye Bold! and Thuro save! “Strike your banners! vain resistance!” Thrice their courage to renew, Drooping courage with assistance, Thuro cheers the vanquish'd crew. Ah! amid the desp'rate toiling, To the last, a Leader's part, Acting brave, a shot recoiling Woful peirc'd the Hero's heart. Then the bloody conflict ending, Gallia bows her crested pride: Shame with deepest sorrow blending, They the Victors will abide. Gen'rous Elliot shields the vanquish'd, For the wounded meet relief Thro' the ships bestows; and anguish'd Mourns the fallen Gallic Chief. Where of old the Nymphs of Ocean Deck'd the warlike Fergus' grave, Crea's Here is the burial place of the famous Fergus Lord of Galloway, who so bravely repulsed the various inroads of the ancient Britons, and gave them a memorable overthrow. streams, in hallow'd lotion, Kindly bathe the mangl'd brave. In her chaste embrace the gallant, She intombs from rolling tide, Where her Chieftans, free and valiant, In her holy fanes abide. Britain's Monarch hails the story Of her conquest; and anew Crowns her Elliot's marine glory, With applause to valour due. O'er the wild waves fearless Britain Shall repel proud Bourbon's yoke: She, by foreign tempests beaten, Flourish like her native oak. Hark! the sons of Neptune bearing Britain's fame from shore to shore, Shout in full carousal cheering, “Haughty Bourbon is no more.” “See her faded lilies drooping, “Sink amain in British wave; “See her pageant glory stooping, “Bends before the free and brave. “To our brave Commanders drinking “Brimming bumpers, let us vie; “They, from dangers never shrinking, “Fight to conquer or to die. “Death or glory is the measure “For the Brave the Fates bequeath; “Britons, spoil'd of Freedom's treasure, “Seek her in the jaws of Death. EPITAPHIUM. Hic situs est Thurot, Dux quem tria regna timebant, Et sobolem jactant, quem tria regna suam. Anglia virtutem, vim Hibernia, Scotia belli, Dura pati; Lodovix nil nisi tela dedit. Sic placuit Fatis. Tres inter consitas gentes, Quam bene nunc cineres trepidans circumfluit Crea: Non vane resupinum, Mavors quem belligerantem Torvum pertimuit facie, Elliotus in undis, Victor tristis æmulum, Laurique sacravit honore.
