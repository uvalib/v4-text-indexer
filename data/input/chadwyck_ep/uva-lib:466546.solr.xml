      <field name="fulltext">TO THE LORD BISHOP OF CHICHESTER, These Seatonian Poems ARE, IN TOKEN OF VENERATION OF HIS CHARACTER AND OFFICE, AND OF THANKFULNESS FOR HIS MANY LABOURS, BY PERMISSION, DEDICATED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE LOOSING OF THE EUPHRATEAN ANGELS. 1845. I. Once more farewell! The sunset ray Is glittering on the tropic bay: Its waves are glorious to behold, With crests of crimson and of gold: But glow, by passing Zephyrs kiss'd, At distance like an amethyst. And clouds of brightness o'er them glance, As 'twere in mystic fairy dance, And with celestial fingers weave A coronet for parting Eve Of wildly purple light: The following Poem is grounded on the commonly received hypothesis, that by the four Angels are signified the four principal Sultanies of the Saracenic empire, which, having been “bound” by the Crusades, were “loosed,” and permitted to extend themselves after the fall of the Latin Dominion in Palestine, and the ruin of Constantinople. It comes! it comes! that matchless glow On heaven above, and earth below, Which brightest dream can never know Till Fancy yields to sight! II. Lo! through the deepening twilight, peep On heaven's serene and azure deep, The shining squadrons of the sky, That never beam on northern eye: Canopus, like imperial gem On night's eternal diadem, And nameless constellations rise That vie with England's winter skies, And half replace their loss: But chief, in perfect beauty drest, Like conscious Empress of the rest, The peerless Southern Cross. Day lingers yet with rosy smile Upon thy peaks, sweet mountain-isle! Or calmly dies away: Where once, through sunshine or through shower, From break of morn till evening hour My feet were wont to stray: The dizzy bridge that spann'd the abyss, The goat-path down the precipice, The mountain-stream, I knew: The peak in sunset purple deck'd, The cloud on crag sublimely wreck'd,— And mark'd the boundless sea reflect The sky's intenser blue: What time the thunder-cloud was spread On Ruivo's crest of gloomy red, And Arrieiros' mighty head Shone out in evening-gold; And modest twilight stole along The needle ridge of sharp Cidr?o, Pico Ruivo, Pico dos Arrieiros, Pico do Cidr?o—mountains in Madeira. And sweet machete was mixed with song In the dim ‘Pilgrims' Fold.’ O lovelier far than tongue can tell, Eternal mountains! fare ye well! III. Eternal! Strange and vain the word Thus of terrestrial beauty heard! E'en now it lingers not,—the day When that magnificent array Like morning clouds must pass away And leave no trace behind: Thus by its ruin giving birth To those new Heav'ns and that new Earth, The resting-place of Peace and Love, The mansions promised from above To ransom'd human-kind: The day in types and signs foretold By seers that prophesied of old; A day of darkness and of woe, Whose advent, angel may not know, Nor man to man declare; Thus taught to spend his hours below In watching unto prayer: Lest haply, coming like a thief, That time of terror and of grief Should take him unaware. IV. Yet not unheralded by fear The End of all things shall draw near: By portents, writ in heavenly lines, By ‘fearful sights and mighty signs.’ The blood-red moon shall walk no more Her path of brightness, as before; The ocean with unwonted roar, And anguish'd moan, shall vex his shore,— The sun be clad in black: The heaven, and all its powers decay, The constellations fade away; And, as she hastens to her end, Must Nature's suffering self portend The universal rack. So saith the vision from on high, The ‘more sure word of prophecy.’ V. Such scenes, serene in faith the while, On that Apocalyptic isle The loved Apostle saw: Elect and blest! To him alone The future glory was made known, The emerald rainbow round the Throne, And God, their God, from Whom His own Eternal comfort draw: The sea of glass, serenely fair, The thousand times ten thousand there That worship day and night: What time, in mystic vision set, He viewed the things that were not yet: And thence, with piercing sight, To earth her future fate reveals In the dread Loosing of the Seals! VI. 'Tis done! A sevenfold Angel-band Take golden trumpets in their hand, And there, the Eternal Throne around, Each hath prepared himself to sound.— The first shrill blast! Rev. viii. 7. And issuing forth From the cold regions of the North, With flinty hearts, and wild blue eyes, And dissonance of barbarous cries, Germanic myriads, pour'd On the sweet land of corn and wine, Athwart the pathless Apennine, The mountain-torrent ford: On, on they sweep with whirlwind-sway, Through steel and fire and death obey The bidding of their lord: And Roman legions shrink and quail, And vain the trust in lance and mail And well-attemper'd sword: Wake, Rome, O wake! 'Tis all too late! The Goth, the Goth is at thy gate! Maiden and veteran, babe and sire, Have known ‘the mingled hail Rev. viii. 7. and fire’ Of that barbarian horde. VII. Another blast! With dauntless breast The conqueror hastens to the West: O'er prostrate realms and kings he trod, —Dark Attila, the Scourge of God! Anguish, and rapine, and dismay Attend the victor's reddening way: On Rome's imperial ocean came A mighty mount, Rev. viii. 8. that blazed with flame: Amidst that troubled sea it glowed, And the changed billow foam'd with blood. Another woe is past: And yet it slumbereth not, the sword That works the Vengeance of the Lord: And dreader fury is outpour'd With each succeeding blast. And still the Angel-voice we know Proclaiming sadly, Woe! Woe! Woe! VIII. From the land of the spice-tree, the land of the palm, Where founts scatter freshness, and flowers breathe balm, Where the breeze, as it travels the greenwood, brings A thousand sweets on his silken wings, And the sky hath no cloud, and the fair earth smiles In the lovely array of the Fortunate Isles; Where at twilight, beside the shady well, You may catch the chime of the camel's-bell; And the hill and the dale are fair to see With the glossy green of the coffee-tree: From the land, on whose happy confines press The fearful realms of the wilderness, With its blistering heat, and its fierce white glare, And the fire of its sun, and the drought of its air; Where from close of twilight till blush of morn, Led forth by the strains of the clarion and horn, They journey right onward,—the pilgrim array,— For the “Ship of the Desert” can teach them the way: —From Araby's country, the far East's boast, The great False Prophet goes out with his host! IX. They gather! they thicken! on, on, they pour! 'Tis a land as the Garden of Eden Joel ii. 3. before: Ye may mark their track as they onward press,— 'Tis a blighted and desolate wilderness: They ford the river, they scale the bank, They stumble not in their serried rank, They laugh at pity, they mock at fear, They scorn the shaking of sword and spear; And the tramp of their horse is as dread and as loud As the burst of a mountain thunder-cloud; And the mail of their horsemen as thick to the eye As the locust-swarm of an Afric sky; And the gold-deck'd turban is seen afar, And ye know the flash of the scymetar: Their prince Abaddon Rev. viii. II. hath well his name, For ruin and havock is all their aim: And men, as they view that onward tide, Shall pant for death as for plighted bride! X. And hark! for the camp and the battle-hour, The dread seducer hath words of power: “They that shall fall in march or fight, Are called by Allah to realms of light: Where in giant pearls the Houris dwell, And reach to the faithful the wine-red shell: With their words so sweet, and their forms so fair, Their gazelle-like eyes, and their raven hair: Where the raptured ear may drink its fill Of the heavenly music of Izrahil: And Tuba, next Allah's throne on high, Owes gladness and Immortality. One sight of that Paradise well repays Long nights of watching and weary days: And he that falls with his sword in hand Shall wake at once in the promised land. And monarch on monarch, and state on state, Shall be conquer'd by Islam,—for Allah is great: And the faithful shall gather the gold like dust, And the gems like pebbles, for Allah is just: And shall comfort His warriors, and wipe their tears, In the endless repose of Eternity's years!” XI. Speed, speed the summons West and North! Call each recruit and veteran forth! Herald of woe! ere yet too late, Haste for thy life across the strait! Legate and Prefect, one and all, Double the guards, and man the wall! Where are the legions, Asia's boast, Where Lycia's pride, and Phrygia's host? Make one brave stand, hold firm one post, The invaders are but men! Be sons indeed of them that died In trampling Carthaginian pride, And forced Jugurtha's battle-tide To his own wilds again! XII. On, on they roll! Ye might as well Check with a sand-mound Ocean's swell, As with pale foot and dastard horse, Dream to oppose the invader's course! Now in the desert,—now, elate, He thunders at Damascus' gate;— The queenly city falls: And trumpets mix with shrieks of woe, And streams of blood, like water, flow In Antioch's purple halls. Avoid that hour of hopeless grief: Tiberias! hail the victor chief! Fair Salem, once the earth's delight, And precious in the Almighty's sight, The irrevocable doom is spoke, Prepare thee for the Othman yoke! —And still, in unopposed advance, The turban'd squadrons shake the lance: Their's is the growth of Egypt's fields, And trembling Alexandria yields The riches of the main: And sea-girt Carthage, she that erst The Roman bands had well-nigh burst, Stoops to the Moslem yoke accurst, And wears the Prophet's chain! XIII. Oh, who may count the hopeless tears That thick bedew the waste of years, While, gathering strength and winning fame, Westward and westward Islam came! A traitor calls: with hope elate They man the ships, they cross the strait: And Calpe, from her beacon-brow, Hath caught the nearing squadron now: And Roderick, waked by battle-din From dreams of pleasure and of sin, Would fain avert, by one brave blow, The trespass that hath wrought him woe, And end, o'ermatch'd in bloody strife, By noble death ignoble life. And Lusitania weeps in chains, And Ebro flows through captive plains, And no deliverer nigh: Save where, the seat of Christian throne, Mountain Asturias holds her own; And Gaul, with gladden'd eye, Surveys the heaps of them that fell Beneath the sword of stern Martel! XIV. Europe is up! from the cot to the throne The summons that issued from Clermont is known: The arrow they feather, the bow they shape, From the snow-crown'd Alp to the Icy Cape: There is donning of helmet in England and France, There is girding of armour and whetting of lance: The war-cry is loud, and the pennon is spread From the Holy Island to Beachy Head: They have taken the vow to be spent and to spend From the cliffs of Dover to far Land's End: And the knights of Normandy burnish the mail, And the burghers of Calais equip the sail: The yeoman comes down from the green hill-side; The lover forsaketh the plighted bride; And Kentish shepherds the sheephook spurn, And the vines are untended in mountain Auvergne: And brambles grow in the field apace, And the deer is tame in the wildwood chase: And the peasant hath shod his oxen twain To serve for steeds in the warrior-train: And farewells are spoken, and vows are made, And prayers are breathed for the great Crusade. For those Four Angels that dwell around The streams of Euphrates must straitly be bound. XV. Like clouds, that in the April day O'er hill and valley flit away, And as the breeze goes by, the grass Can show no traces where they pass, So those rude bands, untaught to know The wiles and onset of the foe, Whose skill-less hand so lately took The javelin for the pruning-hook, Through Europe poured the stream amain That never should return again. The last fierce strife for life and death, The failing hand, the gasping breath, The dying shriek, the anguish fell, Hungarian wolves, ye know right well; Far, far from every loved one's reach Their graveless bones are left to bleach; And long the widow's heart shall beat At every sound of entering feet, Too fondly deeming him at hand That moulders in Bohemian sand. And long the sire, though weary now Of trembling limb and wrinkled brow, Shall call on Heaven with earnest cries That still his son may close his eyes. Few, few of many, shall behold Santa Sophia's vaults of gold: And fewer win their passage o'er The love-famed strait to Asia's shore. XVI. But louder the tumult and braver the sight Where the knighthood of Europe are trick'd for the fight: With Godfrey of Boulogne and Fulke of Anjou And Robert of Normandy, “tender and true”: And the banners wave and the clarions peal, And the host, as it moves, is one glare of steel: They know not of doubt, and they dream not of flight, For their faces are set like a rock for the fight: And the coward Cæsar grows pale afar, And his trembling courtiers the straits would bar: But who shall gainsay them? but who may deny A passage to those that will force it or die? Through Asia they sweep in their terrible might; On the plains of Nicæa they muster for fight: They circle Antioch with mound and fosse, And the Crescent is humbled beneath the Cross: And thinn'd in numbers, but glad of soul, They stand at length at their journey's goal! XVII. Fit theme of high emprise for thee, Bard of romance and chivalry! How first that band, with joyful awe, Afar the Holy City saw: How minaret and dome and spire Glow'd in the parting sunbeam's fire: Mingling that wondrous tale the while With knightly gest and wizard's guile. How, when the hard-fought day was o'er, And Salem own'd the Cross once more, They bade Duke Godfrey take the helm, And guide the tempest-troubled realm: But where his Suffering Lord had worn The Crown inwove with twisted Thorn, He would not,—humble chief as bold,— Put on the diadem of gold. XVIII. Alas! far other theme is ours: We have the thorns, and he the flowers: 'Tis ours to trace, in mournful line, The fated kingdom's slow decline: How with his sires the monarch slept, And Salem o'er his ashes wept: And year by year, and day by day, Resolve and courage died away: And civil feuds wax'd fierce and high, And friends were far, and foemen nigh; And Christian knights dishonour'd troth, And monarchs swerved from plighted oath; And midst the invader's battle-cry There came the sound of revelry; And Moslem-conquerors round the few In ever-narrowing circle drew.— Still, mindful of her brethren's cause, Her sword avenging Europe draws: She sent the noble and the brave To victory,—and they found a grave! XIX. Waken the trump! Bid alarm-bells ring out! Speed forth the herald! make ready the scout! Galleys of Pisa! strain yard and bend mast! Stout be the oarsmen and steady the blast! Pass ye the tidings by pen and by mouth,— Saladin, Saladin comes from the South! Troops he hath victuall'd, forced marches he makes: Quarter in battle he gives not nor takes: Lo! 'tis his herald that biddeth King Guy Look to his palace, for ruin is nigh! He hath sworn by the Black Stone of Mecca to rest When abased is the pride of fair Galilee's crest: When the Templars' fierce lances have melted away, As the wind drives the leaves on November's dim day: When the wealth of the burghers is pillaged and gone, And Palestine knows not the Knights of Saint John: When Salem hath bow'd to the Crescent again, And her king is his captive,—but never till then! XX. At Sephoris they make their stand, The bulwarks of the threaten'd land: There Arnauld, shame of Christian knights, There Raoul of the thousand fights; There, false of heart, in vauntings high, The traitor-Count of Tripoli; Props of the state, the Orders twain Have sent their brethren to the plain: And forced at last to meet the foe, King Guy stakes all on that one throw. No needed rest,—no truce from arms: The night is wild with fresh alarms: And evermore, with battle-shout, The Turcopules are up and out. Oh! for one drop of water now For the parch'd throat and burning brow! At eve the dread sirocco came To fan the desert into flame: No shadows slake that heat intense, No evening-dews their balm dispense: And windward fires blazed high and bright, With demon-art, the livelong night: And many a yeoman sigh'd in vain For England's splashing streams again: And many a knight, with eager eye, Caught the first reddening of the sky, Presaging with its mournful glow A redder battle-field below! XXI. But why pursue, in gloomy strain, The havock of Tiberias' plain, And bid its memory wake? Was the prophetic voice in vain That from the Altar spake? Loose the Four Angels, said that sound, That yet, in dread Euphrates bound, Their mystic chain obey: Avenging spirits, that have power A year, Rev. ix. 14. a month, a day, an hour, The third of men to slay. XXII. 'Tis a fair spring morning! The breeze is high, The clouds flit fast through the bright blue sky; And the voice of the trumpet sinks and swells O'er the purple waves of the Dardanelles: And Moslem cries on the gale are borne From the Seven fair Towers to the Golden Horn: And clarions echo and cannons roar From the Grecian walls to the Lycian shore; For by Othman bands, at their Lord's behest, The Cæsar's City is hardly press'd. And the strong man totters with hunger now, And the mother weeps o'er her child's cold brow: And Prince and burgher are full of woe, For famine hath come to aid the foe. But tidings are spread from gate to gate,— “Five Christian galleys are off the strait!” With countless myriads the walls are lined That gaze on the billows and watch the wind: For steadily onward they win their way, And their prows are white with the snowy spray: They near the harbour, they cross the bar, And their cannon sweep the waves afar: In vain shall the fleet, like a crescent, spread From fair Chalcedon to Pera's head: In vain shall the Moslem tyrant chafe: The harbour is won, and the City is safe! 'Twas the last brave deed of a falling land: The Lord hath spoken, and who shall withstand? XXIII. More glorious then, with kingly mien, The Palæologus was seen In that sad night, when hope was gone, And his last morn was drawing on, Than that Imperial line, so long Renown'd in history and in song, The memory of whose ancient sway, In few brief hours must pass away. At midnight held they council high How best like Christian chiefs to die: How the great Empire, sinking fast, Most gloriously should end at last. For all that night, by torch and lamp, They labour in the invader's camp: They level mound, they fill ravine, The ladder plant, and pile fascine, And fourscore galleys, moor'd at hand, Threaten, with lofty prow, the strand. The Cæsar joins in rites Divine, Eternal Wisdom! in Thy shrine: And pardon from his vassals takes, And mans each post,—for morning breaks: And then, with all untroubled eye, Leaving his halls, goes forth to die. XXIV. The hour is come! the war-cries wake: By sea and land assault they make: And cannons roar, and bastions shake, And arrows shower like rain: And, careless of the heaps that fall, They hurry onwards towards the wall The helpless peasant train, Whose corpses soon shall form the way By which their lord may reach his prey. From morn till noon the fosse they fill: The bridge of death grows higher still; The Christian bands, with labouring breath, Are faint and wearied in the death Of such ignoble foes: Till fresh and panting for the war, With lance, and pike, and scymetar, The Janizaries rose: And pouring in resistless tide Havock and ruin far and wide, They whelm the city's hapless side, And wall and battlement are dyed With freshly welling gore: To new attacks the chieftains call With trumpet, drum, and atabal: From line and galley, bridge and wall, They thunder evermore. The Cæsar flings away the robe That once had sway o'er half the globe: He finds the warrior's death he sought, And, living while her monarch fought, Rome and her sway are o'er. XXV. Seal up the vision! Empires must decay, And monarchs, with their people, pass away: And conquerors on the paths of victory press, And fruitful lands become a wilderness; Resistless nations rise from realms unknown, The mighty fail, the slave ascend the throne: But all, as history's opening leaves unfold, Fulfil the doom the Eternal spake of old: Until, redeem'd and purified from sin, The fulness of the Gentiles shall come in, And that Archangel's voice from shore to shore Proclaims in thunder, Time shall be no more; And they that sleep shall hear the trumpet's call, And Heaven rejoice, and God be All in all! EDOM. 1849. I As Autumn-clouds, when day is almost done, Crowd from the West, in gloomy splendour dyed, And rear a death-pavilion for the sun, With purpler radiance clothing mountain-side, And flinging ghastlier hues on ocean's tide; While the great forest moans, for far and near The fitful breezes strip her summer pride; Wilder the sky, the landscape grows more drear, And Nature stands in awe, and men's hearts fail for fear: II So Earth hath reached her evening. Even now The shadows of her night are closing round; The dimmed crown trembles on the kingly brow, Imperial cities totter to the ground, And all the Powers of Darkness are unbound; For hearts held truest, rights deemed holiest erst, Weighed in the balances, are wanting found; And Faith like chaff before the storm dispersed, And laws of God are scorned, and human ties are burst. III Spirit of Truth, Who knowest all our fears! Prophetic light amidst the gloom display, To Whom one day is as a thousand years, To Whom a thousand years are as one day; By Whose unerring torch, in far survey, The future woes Thy holy seers have kenned, That war, and warlike rumours, and array Of nation against nation, shall portend: These things must come to pass, and then shall be the end. IV O for a vision of the latter time Like that which on the Apostate Prophet came! When, left of God, on Peor's heights sublime He stood beside the sacrificial flame; And, bearing each its annals and its name, The shades of coming empires flitted past; He marked their waxing and their waning fame, He saw the sceptres quail, the thrones downcast, And His dominion rise, which only is to last. V But 'tis not ours to turn the future page, The page concealed from all, save only One; Enough, 'mid records of historic age, To read how He hath said, and how 'twas done: O Queen of many waters, how thy Throne Was meted with destruction's utmost line, And that a desert which was Babylon; How Ninus' towers have felt the doom divine; How, Edom's sovereign once, imperial Petra, thine! VI Never, no nevermore, O Teman's pride, Amidst thy streets shall sound the voice of glee; Never the voice of bridegroom and of bride, Never the tabret and the minstrelsy; Never the wayfarer at nightfall see The taper's gleam, the fire-light's friendly show; The solitary eagle over thee Poises, in evening splendour all a-glow, And from his watch-tower marks destruction's realm below. VII Never, Isaiah xxxiv. 10-17. thou giant of the days of old, The sons of men shall haunt thy homes again; Nor shall the shepherd near thee pitch his fold, Nor shall th' Arabian harbour on thy plain; But doleful creatures there shall have domain, The vulture's shriek resound, the jackal's cry; The adder and the scorpion there shall reign: Such, in th' eternal record writ on high, Was Idumea's fate, the doom of Prophecy! VIII —That old primæval dwelling! where the sun Shot dimly down athwart the forest glade, And the soft breezes, with the eve begun, Sweet whispering in the palm-tree branches made; And dark-haired maidens, when the light decayed, Came with the pitcher to the brimming well, Lingering, till thro' the brake the fire-flies played, And o'er Judæa's far hill-country fell The twilight's crimson haze, and night dissolved the spell. IX Meet dwelling for a Patriarch! there each night To Abraham's God his orisons ascended; There, in the fragrance of the morning light, With whispering leaves and wild-wood notes they blended; There, too, each little knee in reverence bended, At Isaac's bidding worshipped each twin-boy: Then in the greenwood, those sweet matins ended, Or in the sheepfold sought the known employ, Beneath the hallowed shade of Beer-la-häi-roi. X Methinks that in that springtide of the world, Woods, hills, and valleys glowed more green and bright; With lustier sap the vine's young tendril curled Around the wedded elm; the morn was dight With chains of brighter dewdrops, and the night Kindled in lovelier tints the glowing West, And moon and stars shed forth a purer light: Meantime those two, in life's sweet opening blest, In Mamre's shade abode, nor sought for other rest. XI But oh, how far, from one same mountain pouring, Twin streams at birth may speed their several way! One through its rocky bed of torture roaring, One gliding onward in its gentle play Thro' sunny vales, and woods that breathe of May: And those twin forms that in the forest vast Together strayed, together knelt to pray, Together sought their couch,—few years be past,— Whose lot so widely thrown, so parted at the last? XII O Sin, mysterious still, as when at first Our Father stretched his hand, and ate, and fell; In children and in children's children curst, And flinging misery as by magic spell O'er unborn generations!—who may tell The terrors of that slighted day of grace, When he, who soon shall know his loss too well, Can for a late repentance find no place, And bears the curse himself, and brands it on his race! XIII 'Tis done, the irrevocable deed!—And now, Infatuate Esau, thou hast sinned away Thy Birth-right's virtue! vain to smite the brow— To wring the hands—to bend the knees—to pray “Hast thou not yet a blessing?”—But to-day The promise was thine own: now, vainly wise, Thou seest thy glory uttermost decay; For that the grace of God thou didst despise, The Curse ??? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????. Sept. Cont. Theb. 696. shall haunt thee still with dry and tearless eyes. XIV Yes, it is gone, the land with honey flowing, The goodly land!—it never can be thine; The Holy City in God's glory glowing, The Temple, filled with brightness all divine, The Altar, that shall be Earth's central shrine, The festal rites of each revolving year, The glories of the Sacerdotal line: Thy treasury is the sword, thine empire fear, Thy desolate abode the mountain-peaks of Seir. XV He sowed the seed of Sin; revolving years Matured it into Death. As when the gale On its light wings the seedling Upas bears, And plants it, far from men, in Javan dale; From earth and air its little leaves inhale The venom of its race, in every shoot, Until it loads with death the tainted vale; So Esau's crime, that one primæval root, In Edom, age by age, brought forth its bitter fruit. XVI A morn of clouds and darkness! Near and nearer Around God's City draws the dense array; Chaldean trumpets sounding clear and clearer, The requiem pour for Sion's fatal day; Flashes from scimitar the clouded ray; Echoes from crag and tower the trumpet's peal; Assyria's cohorts hew their bloody way; Judæa's chosen warriors faint and reel; And shout responds to shout, and steel is clashed on steel. XVII The Temple glittering in its marble whiteness, His heritage Whom Heaven can not contain, That whilome flashed intolerable brightness From holy Olivet to Ramah's plain, Vain now its Ark, its dread Shechinah vain; The Lord of Sabaoth hath forsook His Throne; Around the brazen steps blood flows like rain; The shriek of agony, the stifled groan, Burst from the scattering flock that late He called His own. XVIII In flickering guise while yet the fire-wreaths played, One sunbeam fell upon it,—'twas the last; And lit up portico and colonnade, And that fair roof that earthly skill surpassed, And those twin glorious pillars, dim and vast; Till gathering flames enwrapped it in their fold, And from the fretted vaulting groin fell fast The glittering dewdrops of the molten gold; And, volumed deep and thick, the smoke-cloud o'er it rolled. XIX There, on the marble pavement, where of yore The vast assembly knelt to keep the Feast; Close to the Altar, where they laid before The spoils of India and the further East, They lie, the mail-clad Prince, the grey-hair'd Priest, The mother, clasping still her clay-cold child; And scarcely yet from earthly pangs released, The maiden-form,—while that last terror wild Still sits on her pale face, and tresses dust-defiled. XX Then Idumæa's mailèd chiefs stood by, And Teman's warriors ranged their cohorts round; “Be Sion for a ruin!” was their cry; “Down with it! Down with it unto the ground!” And in the cross-ways “Neither shouldest thou have stood in the cross-way,” &amp;c. Obad. 14. was the ambush found To cut off Judah's remnant. Faint they came, Wounded, and weak, and weary, with the sound Yet in their ears of shout and rushing flame; And 'scaped the foe to fall beneath a brother's aim. XXI Woe to eternal anger! that can dare Pursue its victim over land and tide, That never ceases, never pauses, ne'er Flags in its ardour, never turns aside, By no fond prayers, no tears, is pacified, Forgiveness laughs to scorn; and then gives o'er When in the heart-blood of its foeman dyed: Woe to the hate that Teman's people bore “Because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity....I will send a fire upon Teman.” Amos i. II. To Salem's chosen towers, the hate for evermore! XXII And think'st thou not, proud Kingdom, that her God Will visit for the wrath that time defies? The city that was low beneath His rod Shall once more lift her turrets to the skies; The glory of the latter house shall rise Beyond the former; yet on Sion's gate The nations of the earth shall fix their eyes, And Kings and Princes enter in with state, Until the Monarch comes on Whom the world shall wait. XXIII But thou, hear thou thy doom. Thus saith the Lord: “O thou Jeremiah xlix. 12—18. that in the mountain-crags dost rest, Vain is thy pride of dwelling,—vain the horde In Seir's tall peaks that fix their eagle's nest; Others with peace and plenty shall be blest, In bondage and dishonour shalt thou bow, By danger harassed, and by want distrest; If all the Earth rejoice, yet shalt not thou, Who bear'st for evermore Cain's mark upon thy brow.” XXIV —A change is on the vision: far and wide Idols have fall'n, and shrines are in decay; From East to West they own the Crucified, And the glad messengers of heavenly day Go forth to preach His Name Who lives for aye; They tell it to Arabia's happy gales, And where the Dead Sea's sullen waters play; And Idumea, in her thousand vales, Reflects that Sun to whom the day-star's radiance pales. XXV On Bosrah's heights the evening's glory falls; The grey rock flushes; from the wilderness The pilgrim marks the glow of Petra's walls, Her palms that tower aloft in summer's dress, Her fortress-crags, her marble terraces; But chief in matchless splendor catch the eye The temples, where in God's great Name they bless; For many a dome, upswelling to the sky, Speaks to the praise of Him That rules Eternity. XXVI Aye, 'twas a glorious scene! what time the Eve Drew her soft fairy veil athwart those piles; As if that house of beauty loth to leave, Departing yet, she decked in loveliest smiles The fair mosaics, and the long-drawn aisles, And flowery capitals, and jewels rare, And ivory, carved in thousand curious wiles; Where morn and night arose the chanted prayer And hearts, inspired by Heaven, to Heaven ascended there. XXVII Founded they were midst agony and fears, When Hell call'd all her forces to th' attack, Midst widows' lamentations, orphans' tears, Midst the wild beasts, the scaffold, and the rack, By men the cost that counted, nor looked back, But through the Cross went onward to the Crown: Whose courage failed them not, nor love grew slack, Until, the Tyrant's malice trampled down, They saw that Lord for Whom on Earth they won renown. XXVIII May not their memories plead? and shall not all The prayers, that like a cloud of incense rise, The alms that like the dews of evening fall, Prevail to avert the judgment of the skies? Is He extreme to mark iniquities Whose name is Loving-kindness? Shall He yet Fix on that ancient deed avenging eyes, And, in His seat of strictest justice set, Remember Edom's sins, her deeds of love forget? XXIX Themselves shall they deliver; and on high With their great Lord accepted shall they stand; Shall wear the garments of felicity, And drink in heavenly joys at His right hand; Companions now of that victorious band Who wear the garland after perils sore: But think not in thy pride, accursèd land, That thou shalt profit by the toils they bore: Thy sea of trouble rolls, though they have gained the shore. XXX Hark The Chronicon Alexandrinum informs us, that the Emperor Decius transported lions from Africa into Edom, to serve as a barrier against the incursions of the Saracens. to the savage uproar! where afar Rome's veteran soldiers, trembling, loose the chain, And, grating on strong hinges, draw the bar Of those wild desert-fiends!—With flowing mane, And blood-shot eyeballs, they that long have lain In durance, sally with impetuous bound, And glory in their strength, and scour the plain: A fence of death to compass Edom round, Another scourge of God for Seir's unholy ground. XXXI —Again the vision changes. For with shout And atabal and lance and scimitar The apostate Prophet's hordes have issued out; And in the swelling surge of Islam's war Nor mountain-range nor desert-waste can bar The warriors of the Crescent, as they go Onward and onward still: till Edom's star, Majestic Petra, lays her honours low; At once forsakes her God, at once admits His foe. XXXII Yet still at even-tide the camel-bells Come chiming up across the desert free; And at the gate the gathering concourse swells The riches of the entering train to see; The precious tears of that bright Indian tree, And coral, torn from deep Philippine bay, And amethyst, and Candian ivory, And gems, that in Golconda's mines once lay, And woven air, that vests the maidens of Cathay. XXXIII And riches grow and splendour; and it seems As all in vain prophetic doom were writ; And royal Petra, in her golden dreams, Sees not before her feet the yawning pit; The Lady of the desert doth she sit, The arbitress of those twin seas;—the mart Where all bright things of either world may flit, All that may touch the eye or win the heart; And who shall lay her low?—who bid her fame depart? XXXIV O hard of heart to yield belief! shall He On Whom the general powers of nature wait, Who holds the elements in ministry, While flame and cloud and tempest form the state He takes, and billows swell to work the fate His mouth shall speak, and lightnings speed intent; Shall He lack means thy pride of heart to abate? Is He a mortal that He should repent? Shall He pass by the sin, and check the punishment? XXXV —It were a glorious thing, if we might be Admitted to the Palace of the Air; It were a glorious sight, if we might see The treasures hid in dread arrayal there, Against the day when mercy shall not dare To check the arm of justice; when on high All fearful sights and mighty signs declare The day of utter desolation nigh, And hope becomes despair, and sorrow agony. XXXVI Not such the power the Lord's right arm hath turned Against thee now; a deadlier curse is thine— An iron sky, with drought perpetual burned, A heaven of brass. O land of corn and wine! Henceforth thy doom is barrenness: the brine Lies caked upon the desert, thick and hoar, As early dew when Autumn's sun-beams shine: Nor seek the cause, too deep for human lore; He works the wonder now Who prophesied before. XXXVII The sun is on the desert day by day, The fierce Sirocco parches up the night, The tall palms wither in the scorching ray, The sand-waves kindle in intenser white: Where once, the fainting traveller's delight, The fountain threw its bubbling waters high, And, scattering dew-gems round it pure and bright, Went flashing forth beneath the summer's sky, And reeds that whispered soft, and leaves made sweet reply; XXXVIII There is a barren glen whereon the heat Smites with its fiercest radiance; bare and black The crags frown o'er it, and when day-hues fleet, Fling on the night-air dread reflection back: Woe for the traveller on the desert-track That hurrying thither, breathes his soul in prayer One drop to find, his maddening thirst to slack; What agony of heart, what dim despair, As down he sinks, to meet his dread foreboding there! XXXIX And hope and love and life are fading fast; The strong man's nerve and pulse avail him not; And still intenser breathes the fiery blast, And vultures hover o'er the fated spot; The lips are drawn; a few tears, thin and hot, Course down the pallid cheek; the gasping sigh Comes short and shorter; memory is forgot; The hands' convulsive catch and glazing eye Point to the conqueror, Death, and speak his coming nigh. XL But still he sees—O vision fond yet sweet!— The shady dell, the cattle by the pool, The cold damp foot-falls of the fairies' feet That print the grass in dewy evening cool: Anon he dreams the tempest-clouds bear rule, And the big drops are falling;—O that plash, As strong desire turns Fancy to its fool! 'Tis now like pattering rain on oak or ash, And now as when o'er crags dark Foyer's waters crash. XLI Such mortal wastes environ Edom round, Fed by no dews, by no cool breezes fanned; The wandering Arab flies that fatal ground, And tells of bones that whiten on the sand Of them that came from some far Western land; And many a tale of awe he loves to weave When tents are pitched, and camels patient stand; What time the caravan is hushed at eve, And the last tints of day the western cloud-wreaths leave. XLII Yea, and he speaks, This belief of the Arabs is mentioned repeatedly by Lord Lindsay, Chateaubriand, and other travellers in the East. night closing darker in, Of sounds, then heard when shepherds pen their fold, Like tramp of horse, and battle's mingled din, That haunt the fields where slaughter was of old; And wails, that make the very heart's blood cold, And shouts of victory and trumpets' bray; And next of low sad voices he hath told, That from the hill-side call, at close of day, The traveller by his name, and lure him from his way. XLIII Woe for him then, as over crag and sand The Spirit of the Wilderness leads on; Ne'er shall he see the watch-fires of his band; Forward and forward, till all hope is gone, Chasing the voice mysterious. And anon Of Pihahiroth's waste the legends tell, Hard by the sea where Israel's glory shone, How aye, since there the red-cross warriors fell, Rings forth, at matin-hour, a ghostly matin-bell. XLIV Land of the drought, the famine, and the sword, Land of unearthly terrors! if it be That, when thy cup of vengeance is outpoured, There lacks one drop of perfect misery To fill the goblet,—not alone on thee These woes descend, but, like the plague-spot, spread O'er them that walk thy plains. O Traveller, flee; They, and they only, have escaped that fled; And they that will abide, their doom be on their head! XLV Come forth in all thy beauty, Star of Night! Look down upon those ruins! See, at last For toilsome travel girt, and armed for fight, The venturous traveller hath the desert past; On broken frieze and capital are cast Fitful and death-like shadows, by the gleam Of Arab chieftain's watch-fire, waning fast; That chief hath sworn the pilgrim Frank should dream In Petra's walls, and drink of Wady Mousa's The Arab chief who conducted Captains Irby and Mangles swore by the true faith of a Mussulman, that the Franks should drink of Wady Mousa, in spite of the opposition of the Sheikh of that place. stream. XLVI Yes, he has gained his end!—has laughed to scorn The perils of the desert and the sword; And those fair piles, of art majestic born, His pencil's magic power hath safely stored; For this to Heaven his earnest prayer was poured, Prayer too successful, if he might but learn The doom against the high adventure scored Of them whose hearts for Petra's treasures yearn— —Through Edom pass who may, he never shall return. XLVII For ah! too late, upon the fevered bed, Tended by stranger hands and stranger hearts, When round his eyes flit shadowy forms of dread, And pestilence through every artery darts Mysterious poison, and the sick man starts At the dim gulph that he must pass—too late Shall he remember, ere all memory parts, How he that enters Idumea's gate Shall speak his mortal doom, and ratify his fate. “Thus will I make Mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out, and him that returneth.” Ezek. xxxv. 7. Keith well observes, that of the four principal travellers who have visited Edom, Irby and Mangles did not pass through it, and they returned home; Seetzen and Burchhardt did pass through it, and they never returned. XLVIII How long, O Lord, how long! And wilt Thou never Look with Thy tender love on Esau's race? And shall the whirlwind of destruction ever Sweep in its wrath o'er Edom's dwelling-place? Th' immeasurable riches of Thy grace, Shall they not win their way?—The heavy sin Die schwere Schuld ist schwer gebüsst. Schiller. Hath heavily been punished: shall not place At last be found that mercy enter in, And that long-promised line of golden years begin? XLIX Yes! far as shore can stretch, or sail has reached, Midst pagan wisdom and barbaric horde, The everlasting Gospel must be preached, And the One Faith acknowledge the One Lord: Then, when as o'er the deep the waves are poured, And earth is full of that All-glorious Name, For Idumea mercy shall be stored, And Seir's wild mount shall yet His praise proclaim, And for her grief have joy, and double for her shame. L O let that day approach! when now at length The kingdoms of the world shall own His sway, The Everlasting! when in matchless strength The Gospel-Heralds shall have won their way, Changed hopelessness to hope, turned night to day, Lightened the blind, taught praises to the dumb, Yea, raised up life in death. And still we pray, Our first desire and last, and wishes' sum, Hasten that glorious time! O God, Thy kingdom come! MAMMON. 1852. Twilight is on the broad and glorious Rhine! From dark ravine and dewy valley now Each stream-voice echoes hoarser: pinegroves sing Their everlasting strain more solemnly, Faint in the distance; faint, and yet most sweet, Like spirit-whisperings, that, when night grows old And the sick taper glimmers faintlier, call The righteous Homeward: brighter ev'n than that, (Bright though that be) wherewith the moon to-night Decks the Seven Mountains. Each, with base enwrapped In solitude and mist and shade, exalts His noble head to a serener world, And wears a halo-diadem of light. 'Twere no unworthy lesson, gazing first On that celestial splendour, where the star That bids the shepherd fold, is riding high 'Twixt Lichtenstein and Sternberg, and the clouds Bright as with bdellium and the onyx-stone Attend the moon, and some few planets dare Her fullest blaze of light, and deck the sky With gems of gold, (that country's gold is good) Genesis ii. 12. “And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx-stone.” Then to look down upon the waves that hide, Dimpling and eddying in their seaward course, That old mysterious treasure, The allusion is to the Legend of the Niebelungen, murdered by Hagen for their treasure, now concealed in the Rhine. swept belike Down to some river cavern, or concealed In the fair treacherous arms of green Lurlei. The celebrated Rhine whirlpool, near Saint Goar. So heavenly things with earthly scenes contrast: They—those celestial riches—breathe of peace, And draw the spirit up, by some sweet charm, Into the City, whose abiding streets Are golden, as it were transparent glass, Whose light has jasper radiance, and whose throngs Wear the blest diadem before their God, And sing His endless praise. The earthly hoard, That dim and yellow clay which men call gold, O'er which the Rhine-waves chant, from age to age, Their song of sadness, teaches other lore: Tells of th' oppressor and th' oppressed; the shriek Of mortal fear, the thick short sob of death, The midnight burial, and the ceaseless worm That gnaws the conscience; tells of fierce despair; And cries, as with the avenger's voice, for blood. O Mammon! thou hast won o'er this fair world (Fair but for thee, and in thy spite yet fair) A heritage of woe! On many a moor From Ural steppes, that greet the dawning day, To the green prairies of the further west, Thou rear'st thy trophies. Where each autumn saw The desert kindle with its blushing heath In all its purple beauty, there, one morn, There sank upon its breast a purpler stain. Thence is the place accursed: thence at eve The lated peasant shuns the spot, and tells Of shrieks that, in the lull of autumn-gusts, Mysterious rise, and footsteps not of earth; And as the shuddering circle gather in Around the winter hearth, the murderer's tale One moral ends: This did the lust of gold. Thine, Spirit of all evil, where the Alps Look from their southern barriers, hoar with snow, Down on Italian plains, and all the land Is young with life and spring, a land of vines And olives, love and beauty, bloom and hope,— Thine, midst dark ilex or the lighter shade Of cork or green acacia, is the Cross, The crosses erected in Southern Europe on spots where a murder has been committed. That, grey with years and battered with the storm, Tells yet, that God's great vengeance never sleeps. In the far west, where suns go down in gold, And fancy loves to linger, building up Her domelike palaces in gorgeous clouds, Islands there are of everlasting spring, Where seas of deep calm blue smile ?????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? countlessly 'Twixt woods of emerald: where, in mimic war, The green banana waves her giant flags, Her silver trumpets the datura sounds, And squadron'd forests, marshall'd as for fight, March o'er the land: where birds of glorious wing, Bright as some rainbow's fragments, kindle up The twilight of the groves; and earth and sky, Redundant with their life, would render back Their flush of beauty, their excess of song, In sacrifice to God, who gave them all,— Thou too hast altars here, thy cursed shrines, The following lines allude to the custom of the Buccaneers, in concealing a treasure, to bury the body of a slave close by, in order that his spirit might keep watch over the deposit. O Mammon, dark with crime, and based on blood: Thither they came, those wanderers of the wave, Who owned no nation, who adored no God Save thee, thou Prince of this world! in whose ears The orphan's cries were song, whose flag was death, In whose regard the widow's tears were joy, And desolate hearths a triumph; in whose hands The cup that, brimmed with wine, had dregs of blood: Thither they brought, their decks heaped high with spoil, Great ingots of rough gold, and priceless stones That flashed a ruby-blaze, or softlier glowed With emerald's sheen, or sapphire's, king of gems: Goblets, embossed with rude barbaric pearl That shone in Delhi's banquets, delicate shrines Torn from the ancient church, where lilies hang In silver droopingness, and oak-leaves wreathe Their golden chaplets, and acanthus twines Its cold moist tendrils in metallic life; They brought the treasures of the tomb,—the ring That in the festival of bridal troth Pledged Loveliness to Faith; the ring that saw, Through many an hour of hope and year of joy, Bright eyes, and happy faces, and the light Of tried affection, and the gathering group Of rosebuds round the mother-rose; the ring That when this life in better life was lost, And earthly swallowed up of heavenly love, Decked the cold finger still, to teach that Faith O'erleaps the grave, and Hope can mock at Death. ....They furl the sails: the grating anchor drops: The black flag quivers idly in the breeze: They choose the spot: a long low tongue of sand, Barren and bleaching in the tropic sun, Or rank with twilight-venom, when the dew From festering jungle, and unknown lagoon, And foul morass, exhales the mortal plague. One gazes on that scene, whose gaze no more Shall earthly landscape fix: the murdered slave Must in the treasure's sepulchre be laid, By prayer unblest, by Christian men unknown, That so his spirit, restless in the earth Until its consummation, evermore Might guard the lone deposit. So at eve Should plunderers fly the spot, and tell of forms Glimmering amidst the shade, and low sad wails, Nor dare to tempt the treasure's spirit-watch. Yet would that these lone places of the earth Were all that owned thy lordship, O thou great And tyrant monarch! Thou, in Christian lands, Exalt'st thy throne above the Throne of God: Thou on His servants weld'st thy heavy chains, And lead'st them willing captives. No expanse Of eastern waters is before us now, No gallant vessel, laden with the spoils Of nations: this is Mammon's truer shrine: High noon on breezy fields and heathy hills, The song of birds, the toying of the gale With trees and flowers: but no sweet sounds of noon, Or sight of summer gladness, which God made, To cheer the heart, to smoothe the brow of him Who sits and toils, a ready slave, for gold. Duskness and dreariness around, and age That brings decay, not reverence: all the air Peopled with motes, that dance like restless thoughts Of riches: tomes inscribed with mystic signs, Huge chests of well-wrought iron, in whose jaws Moulder the parchments, by extremest art Contrived, and hours of patient toil, to give Immortal heritage to mortal man And make the future sure. So days go by Heaping his treasure higher, where he sits The lord of all, intent upon his world Of growing schemes,—and what a world it is! His is the bark that on the southern breeze Spreads her white sails o'er Biscay's stormy gulf: His are the camels that midst turban'd troops Of Islam, and the loud muezzin's cry, ('Tis sunset there) are entering Bagdad's gate: For him the Epirot peasant tills the vine Aulona yields, and Parga's summery height: For him, where cold antarctic suns go down, Midst giant icebergs towering to the sky In grim blue desolation, sturdy hands Press the hard chase of ocean-shouldering whales! For him, in southern groves, where lordly Rhone Gives bridal troth to Arar, spins the worm Her silken vest: for him, in eastern isles, They tear the coral from the sea-nymph's halls, And the pierced fish exudes transparent pearl. He the meanwhile, force, heart, and soul of all, Spans deserts in his schemes, and bridges deeps: Knits east and west in one: nor severed tongues Nor robber-hordes, nor pathless wastes, impede. Yet, lord of others, bowing at his will Nature's hard powers, and man's yet harder heart, Enjoining sea and flame to make a league And do his bidding, borrowing, for the wings To speed his thoughts, the lightning's viewless might; Whom courtly heads are bowed to, whom great kings Delight to honour,—he is Mammon's slave: He to the god of this world offers all, All he has here, and all he hopes beyond: The widow's eye is dim with nightly woe, —He never wipes her tears: the prisoner's heart Is sick with hope,—he never breaks his chains: Therefore no treasures is he laying up Where moth may not corrupt, nor thief destroy: He hath his portion here, for this world's gems Bartering the one true Pearl: for earthly gold Surrendering up the golden streets of Heav'n, And thus, with all his hoards, not rich toward God. And bloodier sacrifice in days of old Men never gave to Chemosh, or the thirst Of sateless Moloch, when in Ammon's groves The shrieks of children filled his dread abode: Albeit no image Mammon's temple decks, Yet stand the victims in his house, and all The instruments of offering: 'tis a feast Not as of old, where once to taste of death Was all the agony his rites enjoined, And though the earthly frame were crushed, the soul Might part unconquered: this, long day by day, And year by year, works death in very life, Dims the bright eye, drives colour from the cheek, Looses the silver cord, dries up the play Of life's sweet fount, and breaks the golden bowl. And as such sacrifice were all too mean, The very soul, God's likeness upon earth, They rack and wear and grind, until it lies Wreck of His work and ruin of itself. Hence childhood is no childhood: hence the Spring Hath no dear innocent pleasures, dewy strolls, And fields with cowslips bright and wreaths of May: Summer no glorious woods, what time the sun Deluges heav'n with his excess of light, But leaves them twilight: Autumn kindles not His burning tints, nor yields his wildwood spoil: And Winter, surly monarch, brings no charms To soothe his frosts and wile his long drear nights, No Christmas fire, nor tale of goblin lore. Nor lacks fit temple for such rites: the huge Misshapen shrine of wealth that, smeared and gaunt, Stretches its many-windowed hideousness Athwart the murky street, and belches forth Its everlasting clouds of smoke and flame: Nor lacks fit music: the incessant clang That jars and thrills and quivers through the dome In fevered hurry, making it instinct As with a ghastly life that is not life, Itself meet anthem for the god of gold. But better spirits now invade thy shrine, Strong though thou art, O Mammon!—stronger far Is Love, that never tires in seeking out The lost and helpless; Hope, that points across Life's stormy deep to Death's serener shore; Faith, kindling at His Word who cannot lie, Her heavenly torch; and Justice, chief of all, That checks the oppressor in his height of pride, Lifts the oppressed from earth, and marks the bounds,— ‘Thus far, but no step further!’ These, howe'er Ill spirits or ill men oppose awhile,— Living and conquering on for evermore, Shall flinch not from the strife, until they set The prisoner free, and speak goodwill to men. But fresher lures are thine, and subtler charms To spread thy worship..... Lo! thou wavest thy wand Over a parched and barren land, a land In earth's far limits, desolate and drear, Whereto no traveller ventures, on whose plains No taper breaks the horror of the night, Nor busy hum of men awakes the morn: But all the summer withers in the fire Intenser suns shoot forth,—with poisonous fogs The dim Pacific blights the closing year,— And night and day its melancholy surge Makes mournful music. At the enchanter's touch The rivers roll down gold: gold streaks the sands: Gold fills the mountain's crystal veins: the rock Is crushed to gold. And straight as if for life, Yea rather, struggling as for Eden's Gate, Men pant and agonise to enter in; Leave all dear home-joys, children's sports at eve, And eyes that tell, and lips that breathe, of love, For dark companionship of them whose heart Hard as the nether millstone, foul with guile, Respects no law, regards nor God nor man, Throws pity to the wind: whose hand is red With stains, that not unnumbered hoards of gold Can turn to whiteness. There, when burning suns Parch life and vigour up, and autumn moons Look down in deadly radiance, toiling on, Heart, hand, and eye intent, they bear all woe, They brave all danger; girding up their loins For battle with the rock and with the storm, The pestilence and savage beast. For them No holy bell awakes the Day of Prayer: For them, when Nature sinks beneath her load, No gentle hands compose the couch, no voice Breathes hope of this world, or the world to come Into the failing ear: the branch-roofed hut That moans beneath the gale, or scantly shades The intolerable glare of noon, is theirs; The rude unhallowed visitings of them Who with foul jest or tale of new-found spoil Would smoothe the dying pillow: last of all, The soul that parts without a hope or prayer; The untended corpse, and hurried unblest grave. Oh! if they knew what half the earthly toil, What half the anguish of their yielding up Children, or bride, or home, or friends, might gain Of heavenly guerdon! There are those that tempt The selfsame peril, bear the selfsame toil, Yea, die, in man's dim sight, the selfsame death. These do it to obtain a mortal prize; Those an immortal. These to gather in A perishable harvest of the dross That fades with very using; those to gain An endless meed of labour: souls redeemed By no vile price of things corruptible, But with the Blood of that Eternal Lamb, Who wills that where He is, they too should be. Servants of God, press onward! In His sight Your perils and your toils are laying up Your great reward: His are ye: Him ye serve; And suffering with Him, with Him too shall reign. It were a glorious scene, if, rolling back The thick dim mist of ages, we might bid Those princely merchant cities live and glow In second life! Thee, Tyre, the mart of earth! Whose white sails glittered from the prophet-heights Of Carmel, to the portals of the west, The twin Atlantic pillars; yea, that dared, With unknown oceans battling, to upraise Their Asian flag on Europe's western shores. Thee, Carthage, that in equal contest long Strov'st for the world's huge empire: thee not least, Bride of the Adriatic, building up On the blue waves thy snowy palaces, A very dream of beauty, where all day Dome, spire, and lordly arch, and hallowed shrine Mirror themselves in that unruffled main, And all night long the moon, from that deep sky, Weaves fairy network out of light and shade Athwart the river streets. By thee they rose, O Mammon, Prince of this world! They by thee Attained their height of fame: by deeds of blood And merciless rapine adding realm to realm, And heaping hoard on hoard, till like the fire Kindled from exhalation of some marsh That shoots across the autumn night, they sank And left a dark and sudden void behind. Not such as these, my country! though on thee, Spite of thy boast, hang Mammon's heavy chains, Yet not as these thou drew'st thy battle sword When banded Europe, resolute to bow Thy forehead to the dust, stood girt for war: Thou, not as they for lucre's cursed sake, Pour'd'st forth thy chosen warriors at his call, Who, when the oppressor's rod was snapped in twain, Lured by no fancied glory, turned aside By no ambition, sheathed his victor sword, Spake the glad tidings, and bade earth have peace. Therefore his name thro' England's thousand homes Was as a household word: and now his deeds Are with past ages, England weeps at once The hero o'er his foes and o'er himself With tears unknown before: and other years Shall wreathe a deathless chaplet round the name Of him whom righteous cause and mighty toils And victor-end made glorious—Wellington! Honour to them, and blessing be to Him Who made them what they are, that dare to laugh At Mammon's witcheries, building up on high Their surer treasures! Following in His steps Who, seeing “all the kingdoms of the world “And all the glory of them,” stood unmoved, They turn away from perishable things And seek their meed in heav'n. They speak the word: The tall spire glimmers o'er the swelling copse Of oak or chestnut, hallowing all the scene, And calls to prayer the hearts that never prayed, And turns the scoffer's blasphemy to praise. They in the fœtid caverns of the mine Shed holiest light: they from the mouths of babes And sucklings perfect praise: they speed the sail That flakes the great Atlantic, or that glows In summer creeks betwixt palmetto groves, Or hails the midnight sun, where icebergs grind Against the eternal barriers of the Pole. The wilderness and solitary place Pour blessings on them: smile the desert wastes, And blossom as the rose: they gather in The harvest of the earth, against the day When the round world shall be the Lord's again, And all the fulness of it. Then at last The kingdom and the riches shall be His, And He shall reign for ever. Wanes the night, And day is dawning fast: our part shall be To hail each brightening streak that heralds now Its near approach; and till it breaks, to watch! JUDITH. 1856. I. The gloom and gathering of a night That heralds in the storm! On ancient gate, and terraced height, And bulwarks towering in their might, And, in the eve's last radiance bright, Each massy idol form, To whom, in days of old, as now, Chaldæa's children love to bow;— To whom, in hymns of praise, ascribe Their victories o'er each warrior-tribe, O'er Sepharvaim's Isaiah xxxvii. 13. distant shore, Henah and Ivah, names of yore: And all the city's toil and strife Is blending into rest: As droops Day's brightness and its life Amid the dark'ning West. II. More lone and dark, more grey and grim, Each temple sinks in silence dim: The shades a deeper awe diffuse Amidst those awful avenues, Where wingëd forms of giant height Stretch out to distance infinite: And where, while evening's softer balm Descends 'midst intervening palm, And bids its feathery branches wave O'er frieze and vault and architrave,— Each monster mass of storied stone Seems more unearthly and more lone: Each idol-vista, South and North, Glooms more interminably forth, And points, in ever-narrowing Aisle, Towards the Temple's central pile. Yes:—even in very ruin, vast, Such relics of the Assyrian past, Midst desolation, drought, and sand, Startle and awe the pilgrim band. The pomp and revelry of yore, The music and the mirth are o'er: The halls that flashed with gems and gold In one decay are blent; No shepherd there will pen his fold, Nor Arab pitch his tent: No sight to bid the heart rejoice, No scene of pomp and pride: Hushed is the feast, and stilled the voice Of bridegroom and of bride: Those memories of a victor-race Are all arrayed in gloom: There finds the owl her dwelling-place, There bitterns build and boom: Such was the lot denounced of yore By masters of prophetic lore, And such Assyria's doom. III. But now, as daylight dies away, And eve turns purple into grey, Tier over tier, in dizzy height, The palace flashes into light; The halls glow out more fiercely bright, The courts more wildly blaze: And deeper yet, and deader shades O'erwhelm the silent colonnades, Amidst whose dim and vast arcades No venturous footstep strays. The mansion of imperial state, With light and shade reticulate, Lifts up her blazing head on high, And glares against the midnight sky: The trumpet bids her brazen throat Above the feast resound, And dulcimers with gentler note, And flutes make airier music float The vaulted roof around. IV. Then went the royal edict forth, (That lordly gathering's end,) —“Thus saith the Lord of all the earth,— Let all the earth attend: Each race and tribe that owns our sway From the great Sea to far Cathay, From where the twilight dies away, To where the morn dawns, freshly grey,— Our will receive,—our law obey;— And this shall be the sign: Our chiefs and squadrons, issuing out With pomp of war and battle shout, To every land and realm shall go,— —Or parched by summer's fiercest glow, Or girt with everlasting snow, Or decked with oil and wine: From each receiving, at their feet, Water and earth, the tribute meet That marks us this world's monarch throned, The Lord, by all his vassals owned; In token of our royal right And Nabuchodonosor's might.” V. As once on Egypt's evil day The locust-swarm arose; So, in its terrible array, O'er lands that tremble and obey, The endless torrent flows. All have one courage, all one vow: In meet array they muster now, Marshalled for war, and charged with death, On the green plain of Bectileth: For every realm hath armed her best, And sent them to the fight: And North and South, and East and West, Their varying sons unite: They leave the jungles, wild and far, That choke the vales of Malabar: They leave the shores where pearlfish lie Midst seas that seem another sky: From Tartary's steppes they pour amain; And Beloochistan's arid plain: They leave the mango-woods that rise Beneath the glare of Indian skies, And the sweet palm-groves and the rest Whence Araby hath name, the Blest: Yea, where he mats, with sand and weed, His hut, the starveling Samoyede, They gather, in unwarlike shew, With the rude pike and ruder bow: They come, convened by spell and ban, The nomad tribes of Turkistan: And Lydia's women-hearts are there, And Phrygia's sons their falchions bare. For Nabuchodonosor's yoke The whole wide world must sway: The Lord of all the earth hath spoke,— Let all the earth obey! VI. Where is the God of Israel now? And where is Israel's Trust? And shall His ransomed yield to bow Before an arm of dust? Westward and westward rolls the storm; Beyond Palmyra's walls they swarm: Damascus' harvest-fields were white When morning kindled into light; Damascus' harvest-fields, at night, Were bare, and black and seer: Judith li. 27. No more the merchant-craft shall ply Among the cities, walled and high, That, in the crystal Arbonai, Ibid. ii. 24. Are mirrored fair and clear: And Midian's sheepcotes, wrapped in flame, Shall speak of Midian's woe and shame, To many a coming year. As Eden smiles the land before; Their sheaves the peasants bind; And, like Gehenna's very door, The wreck that glares behind. Ho, all! your closest squadrons form! Westward and westward rolls the storm. VII. O gods of many an ancient fane, Gods of the mountain and the plain! Are hecatombs of victims slain, Are magic spells and rites in vain One little hour of peace to gain, One little hour of right retain, Before the invader's host? O shrines, with human blood-drops dyed, Proved then most false, when sorest tried! Have all your thousand prophets lied,— Was falsehood all their boast? What! in this great and fearful hour, Hath Baalzebub's arm no power? Hath Dagon ceased to save? Must suppliant hands in vain embrace Their Nisroch of the eagle-face? Finds Tyre from Tyre's own god no grace, That lady of the wave? Yes! perish all the impostors' swarm!— Westward and westward rolls the storm. VIII. O Israel, once the Lord's elect! Can Israel's God no more protect? O Thou, their glory and their song, Why standest Thou far off so long? Where are the mercies shed of old Upon the sheep of Thine own fold? Look, how Thy ransomed people bow In sackcloth and in ashes now Around Thy holy shrine; And still Thou answerest not their vow, And still Thou giv'st no sign. Not one is there, from shore to shore, That understandeth any more; Not one that, skilled in prophet-lore, May speak to Abraham's line. Awake, and manifest Thy praise To those assembled nations; Awake, as in the ancient days Of former generations! Yea, for Thy loving-mercy's sake, Arm of the Lord, awake! awake! IX. Keep the hill-passages up from the plain; Westward and westward they hurry amain: Strengthen the battlement! burnish the brass! Stop ye the fountain, and scarp ye the pass! Men of Bethulia, mark from afar All the long line of the oncoming war: See, how the horizon is heaving in life! Multitudes, multitudes rush to the strife! Squadron on squadron are battleward rolled: Elephants stalk in their trappings of gold: Steeds, in their madness of joy to engage, Swallow the ground in their fierceness and rage: Battle-axe, battle-bow, scymetar, lance, Flash out around them the armies advance: Water and earth ye have sworn to refuse,— Vengeance they vow on the land of the Jews: None shall escape me, the great or the small, Saith Holofernes, the Lord of them all. Men of Bethulia! gallant and true! Judah and Benjamin lean upon you. X. Of all most fearful woes to try, Of all most dreadful deaths to die, In the dark crew of suffering first, Now is thy time to rule, O Thirst! No water from the living well; Nowater from the pool; No drop, from Heaven's own blessed cell, To comfort and to cool! Once happy childhood, day by day, Now moans its tiny life away; The little tongue no more can speak; Death's greyness shades the little cheek; The frame is stretched on misery's rack; The eyes grow glazed, the tongue grows black: The big unconscious tear-drops fall Whose end shall be that Heavenly Hall Where tears are wiped away: And the strong man is brooding nigh In voiceless, matchless agony, To watch, with dim and fever'd eye, His darling's slow decay. With death, and such a death, in view, A single heart is good and true, And from the city one great wail Goes up to God above; And man's resolve and courage fail, But never woman's love. Then wakes the murmur fierce and strong, But hushed at first, and low; “How long, O Lord of Hosts, how long Must we resist the foe? What thought of hope? what use to wait? Give up the keys and ope the gate!” —And gathering tone, and winning strength, It swells amidst the crowd at length: “Assyria's Chiefs have scaled the pass, Assyria's hosts environ; The Heaven above our heads is brass, The Earth beneath is iron: Better, where every choice seems worst, To die by sword, than die by thirst. Yield then the city, ere too late: Give up the keys, and ope the gate!” XI. “Have courage, brethren! five days still For patience and for prayer; Those past and over, have your will, If then no succour in our ill Proclaim Jehovah's care.” —Resolved against the Assyrian yoke Ozias thus, and Charmis spoke. “Meanwhile, send up one earnest cry To Abraham's God, Who dwells on high, To hear us from His Sanctuary, And work deliverance there.” XII. Hast thou not seen the evening star, When, victor o'er the midnight war Of thunder-clouds on high, It glitters from their darksome breast, Impressing on their fierce unrest Its own serenity? Thus, as debate grew high and loud, And wild division rent the crowd, Forth, as they spake such words of shame, In all her beauty, Judith came. Heav'n gave the far-off star its beam: Earth's vapours feel and own its gleam: Heav'n sent amidst the angry press A vision of such loveliness, With skill to guide, with hope to bless, To be their comfort in distress, And bring them to the port. And thus she stood amidst the strife, As one that came with words of life From God's celestial court. XIII. “And is it thus ye bind,” she cried, “His strength, Who dwells on high? Thus mete His power to guard and guide, Who made the earth and sky? Wherefore should He accept the term Of this world's child, the dust and worm, And save you when ye will? Is it not His, to-day, to-morrow, To fix the period of your sorrow, And turn to bliss your ill? O slow of heart! O dull of hope! Five little days your utmost scope? Five days His sovereign power to tie, Whose own is all eternity? Hear me: by me shall come the blow That lays the Assyrian tyrant low In all his fierce array: Hear me: God's strength shall be my lamp, His Wisdom be my stay; And thus amidst the alien camp His light shall guide my way. In Him confiding, let me go, And ye shall find, and Israel know, One woman's arm can quell the foe, One woman's hand can deal the blow That sets Bethulia free.— And wilt Thou not, O Lord, be just To crush the mighty in the dust, And to lift up the hearts that trust And make their boast in Thee?” XIV. Now are her widow's robes laid by, Her joyous garb put on; And thus, apart, with tearful eye, She makes her orison: “Thou Who—and Thou art still the same— Did'st arm with righteous brand, Avenger of a deed of shame, My father Simeon's hand; Such courage now on me confer, Thine own avenging minister: And nerve my arm and steel my heart, That, though I win by woman's art, My hand may play no woman's part In retribution's hour. So Assur's chiefs and serfs shall own That Thou art Lord, and Thou alone; And all their gods of wood and stone Shall tremble at Thy power.” XV. Now, in the camp, the watch-fires' light Was smouldering to decay, As, through the stillness of the night, To where the tents gleamed ghostly white, Two women bent their way. The mirth was high, and loud the song In Holofernes and his throng: The silver lamps soft radiance poured; With gold and jewels flashed the board: And silken hangings waved on high That blazed in Sidon's deepest dye, Where, 'neath that priceless canopy, Assyria's chieftain lay. In vaunting high, in frenzied hope, With Israel's God he dares to cope, And laugh at Israel's stay. She came, Bethulia's fairest form, As dawns the rainbow on the storm: She came the chieftain's eyes to bless And conquer with the loveliness That, in his hour of joy and mirth, Promised a Paradise on earth. With words to comfort and secure, The tale she wove, she framed the lure; How Israel's God would soon forsake The people of His rest, Because His holy tithes they take, By famine sore distrest. “That done, Bethulia's towers shall be, Lord Holofernes, given to thee: And thou and I shall work a deed Whereof the years to come shall read: Shall raise the power, and swell the fame Of Nabuchodonosor's name. Such is the task that He ordains, The God Who over Israel reigns; I am His servant, as ye see: He hath a work to do by me.” XVI. Five days of fear, five days of woe, Five days of triumph to the foe, And still no help is here; The shadows lengthen out upon The giant plain of Esdrelon, Another eve is near. Then had ye seen, if mortal eye Might pierce the shades that hide Those portals of eternity Where future things abide— Then had ye seen, midst evening's ray, Death's Angel speed his bidden way: To no mean man his course is bent; He comes not for the old; He hath an errand to a tent That flames with gems and gold: He hath an errand to the strong, The high of heart and pride: For vengeance, though it tarry long, Shall not be turned aside. Vain, Holofernes, now to flee; He hath a message unto thee! XVII. Night hath come down in its gloom and its state: Hark! in the stillness a voice at the gate: “Open the portal, assemble the crowd, God the Avenger hath smitten the proud; Tell ye the tidings to far and to near; Conquering Judah, away with your fear! Spite of his rage, and his threats, and his lust, Great Holofernes is stretched in the dust; He at a woman's feet bowed him and fell; Him his own falchion hath hurried to hell: He that o'er kindreds and nations had sway, He, whom the wide world had learned to obey, Found in the beauty of woman his lure,— Found it and perished,—and yet she is pure. Nineveh now shall have wailing for mirth, Now shall her idols be bowed to the earth: Send ye the tidings to Salem with speed; Incense shall glimmer and victims shall bleed. Own Him, Who trust in His goodness rewards, King of all kings, own Him Lord of all lords! XVIII. Those scenes are past—but past is not The faith and hope they tell; That raised a Judith's victor lot, That consecrates the mountain spot Where Holofernes fell. The deed is o'er, the faith remains: The faith that through all toils and pains Shall win her conquering way; That scorns her light affliction here, And sees in vision bright and clear The things that last for aye: The faith that rather chooses now The mockery of her foes, And to her God persists to bow Though all the world oppose: The faith that for her Captain's sake Hath braved the scaffold and the stake; The faith that, spite of care and fear, God guard and strengthen in us here, Although its vision must be dim, Until He take us Home to Him! SINAI. 1857. Eternal Spirit, Who in ancient days To Thine elected servants,—thenceforth filled With wisdom to discern things else seal'd up From human eye, and courage to proclaim The truth amidst a world that hates the truth, And lore prophetic, and the artist-skill That shapes to heavenly beauty earthly forms,— In divers times and sundry manners spak'st; Sometimes amidst the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on the sons of men, Anon by parable, or type, or sign, In varying nature; Thou Whose lore was heard On desolate mountains or on city roofs, In sevenfold thunders, or the still small voice;— If Thou, from God proceeding, God Thyself, Dost on the sightless pour Thy Day, dost wake To heavenly harmonies the sleeping ear, Dost teach the dumb to speak Thy praise, the dull Of heart to know Thy knowledge,—hear me now: And since of Thee, though not as yet Thyself, But in Thy works, made manifest, my theme,— So guide me doubtful, so uphold me weak, That I, with awe and reverence, knowing well The place whereon I stand is holy ground, May yet draw nigh to that great sight,—yet hear The Angel-trumpet wax exceeding loud, And tell, nor rashly nor unmeetly, how ‘God came from Teman, and the Holy One From Paran, Exodus xiii. 18; and margin. at the Giving of the Law, And bade the whole wide world hear Sinai's voice. Oh! for one glance at that tremendous night, That night to be remembered, when the host Encamped by Pi-hahiroth, at the word —“Command that they go forward!”—dared the sea: A brazen wall on this side and on that, Fathoms on fathoms overhead, its waves Curled and leapt up and bounded in their joy, Beneath that mighty strong east wind, while yet It girded in that horrid vale, a wall As solid as the eternal adamant: And still, as morning kindled to high noon, And still, as high noon melted into eve, The pillary cloud went on, half cloud, half tower, Before the ransomed people, till at last Old Afric's dim mysterious range began To burn in living purple, purple first, Then furnace-like, beneath the sun's red ball: And ever, in their five-fold Exodus viii. 18; and margin. ranks, moved on The people of the Lord,—and evermore Chariot and horse,—innumerable host!— The flower of Zoan, followed hard behind: Until the westering orb's last rays were shot Athwart the glassy sea-walls, kindling up A thousand magic colours, such as ne'er Sparkled in sea-nymph's cave or Indian gem: Next came the great grey calm of that day's death: Then mailed Orion eyed the two-fold hosts. But when the fourth watch of the night had changed Israel's angelic guards,—for such were there Then,—‘and they had but newly set the watch,’ Judges vii. 19.— The pillar-cloud removed behind, and flashed Unutterable brightness o'er the rear Of that retreating victor-host, and poured Intolerable gloom on Egypt's rout,— Nor saw the one the other all that night. Who can assault, when God Himself defends? If God be for us, who can be against? The morning dawns,—the rod is stretch'd,—the flood Returns in all his strength,—and Israel sees The Egyptians dead that day on that sea-shore. —And thus, O Captain of Thy faithful band, True Leader of Thy people! even thus Thou, by Thy mighty hand and outstretch'd arm, —Stretch'd out upon the Cross,—hast set them free From worse than Egypt's iron chain, led home Thy banished ones from exile, crowned Thy Saints With light and life and everlasting love! O change of changes! from the Land of On Into the broad free desert! No more now Those requiem-chambers of the old dead world, Those mountain pyramids of Kings, where each Reposes in his glory,—by the craft Of painter imaged on the narrowing walls Of corridors and passages and vaults; Of corridors more labyrinthine still, More intricately serpentining, led In everlasting funeral array Of one long, long procession,—on, on, on, Midst monster-headed genii, and the forms Of gods and demigods, and her that holds The ostrich feather, Justice; and the Sun Hawk-headed, and Osiris: while above On every cornice painted thousand-fold Spreads its blue wings the all-embracing sky: Till in the central vault of all the dome, The central vault, whereto the endless lines Intwisted and enlinked, corradiate still, Received among the gods, a god himself, In the black marble of his last long home The lonely lord of all the fabric lies. No more of death! The desert teems with life, The broad majestic desert! From this peak I see all Israel marshalled in his tents According to his tribes! And vanward there Ramps Judah's royal Lion, from whose might The kingly sceptre never more shall pass Till, Priest and Monarch, Shiloh's self be come: And he that trusts in guile, and not in strength, The adder by the horse-path; and the race Whom in unequal war a troop must first Conquer, but ‘he shall overcome at last’: And he, the wolf-whelp, that at morning-tide Shall ravin, but at eve divide the spoil: And he, whose blessings have prevailed beyond The blessings of his ancestors, and filled The utmost bound of those eternal hills: I see them all—accursed he that bans, Blessed be he that blesses them!—arrayed With their Almighty's own Almightiness,— All fed with bread celestial, all baptised So lately, ‘in the cloud and in the sea.’ 1 Cor. x.2. What do they here? where straitening in, the plain Sees on each flank his mountain-walls arise In ever-narrowing defile scarr'd and seam'd; Here purple, as the mid-Atlantic; there Crimson as grape-leaves turn at autumn's touch: As if each multitudinous mass had boiled With foaming fiery lava, and at once Heard some magician's voice, and turn'd to stone. What do they here?—Nay, this is not the place: This is the vestibule, and not the shrine; Though here, too, morn by morn, how wildly grand To hear the myriad-voiced unearthly hymn Reverberated back from rock and peak, And ‘toss'd and troll'd’ from cliff to cliff,—‘Arise, ‘Arise, O Lord! and scatter Thou Thy foes! ‘Let them that hate Thee flee before Thy face!’ Numbers x. 35. But onward eye and heart and soul! while still, As prescient of some dreader mystery, Rocks, giant rocks, grow more gigantic,—peaks Tower heavenward more sublimely; all wild forms Mix in a wilder chaos, all deep hues Assume a tint yet deeper; girding in The very Altar of that mountain shrine, That naked platform-cliff that towers on high, Goal of the course and temple of the hills. That is the spot of spots to mortal man: That is the place whence God shall teach the world. O wondrous Pentecost!—when wan and dim Over the mountains of the unknown east In all her timid beauty woke the morn: A summer morn:—but not like summer breeze The rushing mighty wind that swept adown Each moaning cleft, nor yet like summer clouds The flashing glory of the Sacred Mount: They gather, tent by tent and line by line, The thousands and ten thousands,—every eye Upturn'd in mute expectancy of awe: And a great dreadful hush is on the camp. They gather,—sinful man to meet his Judge, The creature his Creator: face to face Shall mortal eyes see Him That made not death. They gather,—and at once the mountain-side Is clad with darkness, darkness to be felt, Horrible, outer darkness: waxes straight The trumpet's voice exceeding long and loud: And thus, midst thunder-peal and lightning-flash, Midst sights and sounds of terror, and the gaze Of trembling multitudes,—God spake the Law. Oh high eternal Law! so pure amidst The vast defilements of an evil world, So resolute to keep thine onward path Though human subterfuge and earthly guile, Though force and fraud and profit block thy way: Yea, though in all her hideous forms, gaunt Pain Start up to match Thee, and though Death itself —And who but thou canst conquer death?—oppose! Thou, like the sun-ray, that will enter in The lordly palace, kindling up its state, And adding glory to its gems and gold, And lustre to its riches, yet not less Will kiss the cradle of the peasant's babe,— Thou stand'st midst nations on the battle-field Supremest arbiter, and though awhile Hush'd midst the din of arms,—yet still thou call'st The God of Battles to thy constant aid To crush the oppressor, and to raise the oppressed: And not the less, midst sights and sounds of peace, Thou gently lead'st the gentle: not the less Presid'st o'er children, like a child thyself; Art with them from the cradle, goest forth As forth they go to battle with the world; And guarded by them, guard'st them to the end. For thee the Martyrs dared to win their Crowns, And drink the bitter cup of this world's woe, Strong in thy strength, if so they might attain The river of God's bliss for evermore. And still a living, still a reigning power Thou conquerest and shalt conquer till that day, That blissful day, when justice shall exult, Triumphant, in its own euthanasy, And there be no law but the law of Love. But hark! Amidst the thunder and the din Of tempest and of trumpet, that low voice That whispers,—‘Speak thou with us, we obey; But let not God speak with us lest we die.’ And thus he goes, alone of mortal men, Into the thick black darkness: thus the Chief, The daysman Job ix. 33. 'twixt the people and their God, In that mysterious forty days, heard sounds Ineffable by human voice, saw sights Intelligible to no earthly eye. There saw he all the glory of the Lord, There saw he all His goodness: not as that Which makes the heavenliness of heaven itself, The Beatific Vision: that to gain Needs must we lay aside this earthly vest And put on the celestial: not so he Who then saw God, and seeing God, yet lived. Yet oh! for that brief hour wherein he heard The wondrous proclamation, written yet Deep in the inmost heart, as oft as now Some wandering sinner turns again to God! It came not in the terror and the storm, It was not echoed in the thunder-peal, It flashed not in the lightning: soft its voice As breath of summer gale o'er beds of flowers, Soft as the gentlest, tenderest fleece of cloud That flecks some mountain-peak at eve: ‘The Lord The merciful and gracious: pardoning sin, Forgiving all transgression: keeping truth And covenant and mercy with His own To thousand generations.’—Thou hadst need Thus pardon, Lord, if man will thus rebel! Scarce was the wondrous vision closed, and scarce The summer sun was shining as he wont On the grey sides of Horeb, weaving there That everlasting vest of light and shade On immemorial crevices and peaks, Than, false and faithless to their plighted word, “All that the Lord commands us, we will do,” —Forgetful of His Hand, Who made the sea A way for His redeem'd, they crave new gods To lead them onward,—they proclaim a feast,— The desert has its Martyr, Reference is made to the Jewish tradition that Hur, for opposing the idolatry of the people, was put to death; which gives an emphasis to the question addressed by Moses to Aaron, “What did this people unto thee?” and the crowd Bow down before ‘a calf that eateth hay.’ O Faith, whose trophies deck this lower world, Albeit thy guerdon is laid up on high!— Who nerv'st the feeble arm to dare great deeds For Him thou lovest, steel'st the woman's breast To conquer death, and tortures worse than death, And shame beyond all tortures,—who hast stood, When earthly hopes and earthly helps drop off Like autumn leaflets from a mountain ash, Firm as the mountain where that ash hath root,— And calmly point'st from earthly agony Which is but for a moment, to the prize Of more exceeding and eternal weight;— Where wert thou then? Thenceforth the heavy wrath Fell upon Israel: plague on plague thenceforth, Affliction on affliction: till, save two, None entered on the blessed vales and hills That flowed with milk and honey: none had part In the long-promised and the final rest. Five centuries pass. O space of this brief world Writ in what characters of woe and blood! What empires have departed! What great wars Have thundered and have passed, like summer storms! What conquering realms have owned the victor's yoke, What victors been forgotten! yet those peaks, Horeb and Sinai, and the lesser heights That gird the sacred valley, still shine out In all their summer majesty, though none, Save wandering Arab, now may lift his eye Up to the hills whence Israel's help once came: Whence Israel's help still comes. For faint and lone, A solitary exile ventures nigh Where once the tramp of thousands echoed—where Once the twelve tribes fell down and owned the Law. Can he the lonely, he the exile, he The fugitive and alien, can he come In the same strength wherein these thousands marched, Strength not their own, but drawn from Him, the same To-day and yesterday and evermore? Yes: great the tribulation whence he flies; But great his victory also: he of late Stood single midst the host of idol-Priests, Alone confronting Israel's gathered tribes. “Choose ye this day the God whom ye will serve: The Lord of Hosts or Baal: and the power That answereth by fire, let Him be god!” Then all day long rose wail and moan and prayer Up to the molten image—Israel's King And Priests and people, call upon their god, —No voice, no sound,—not any that regards. And now the Western sea is bridged with gold Where the great sun is sinking: like a path For happy spirits, freed from earthly toil, To enter on their land of golden rest. Faint as a summer-cloud, the rosy peaks Of Cyprus crest the horizon:—that besides All is blue sea—blue, calm, unruffled deep: The winds have died away, one lazy cloud Hangs o'er the scene:—the palm-trees have forgot To whisper, and the parch'd and thirsty ground Sees yet another twilight gather in Upon a heaven of brass and fields of iron. But when in Salem's Temple far away The evening sacrifice was offered up, Then stands the Prophet by his Altar—then Bids them o'er victim, base, and trench, to dash Their barrels from the ocean, ere he call The God of Heaven,—the God in Whom we live And move and have our being, to reply. “Hear me, O Lord, and let all Israel know That Thou hast turned this people's heart to Thee!” At once across the grey sky redly glared A cataract of fire: at once the stones And dust and ocean-wave and victim blazed; And the great cry rose up from earth to heaven, —“The Lord is God! The Lord, He is the God!” —And now, aweary of his life, he treads With slow and painful footsteps all the path That his forefathers went:—and sore bested By foes that thirsted for his blood, he seeks The lonely peak and ancient Mount of God. Thence fed by Angels' food, the wanderer comes To test its ancient fame: hath Sinai's God No fresh deliverance? dwells in Sinai's ridge No mystic influence yet? Or hath the past Buried the past, and were the ancient days A tale of wonder, not a pledge of help? There, in the darkness of the cave, he rests Faithless and hopeless:—“Take away my life: I am not better than my fathers were.” Forth from the Lord's own seat the tempest came: The wild ravines re-echoed: aged rocks, Grey with the lichens of a thousand years, Fought their last fight against that storm, and fell: But the Lord was not in the wind. Then quaked The ridges where His feet had stood of old: The mountain trembled: dismal sounds rang out From its dark womb, and echoed down the vale. (Such wails he hears, the wandering Bedouin, What time eve closes in, and deems that moan The voice of God, and awe-struck flies the plain.) But the Lord was not in the earthquake. Next A mighty fire was kindled on the brow Where once His footsteps passed with prints of flame. Glowed in its light,—for eve was closing in,— Each nearer peak and shattered pinnacle, Glowed terebinth and ilex, glowed the cliff Purple, or deeper crimson,—while within The ghostly cavern flung fantastic shades. But the Lord was not in the fire. And then A still small voice proclaimed the present God. What dost thou here, Elijah? O great Mount! Great with the mysteries of God's earlier voice, Great, for that on thy statutes, weal or woe,— Eternal weal, eternal woe,—depend, Thou stoodest forth of yore, thou standest yet God's mountain midst all mountains: where His power Is stamped in characters of living flame, The birth-place of the Law, the Law of fear, The law that saith, “This do and thou shalt live: This do not, thou shalt die.” From thee we turn, From thee and from thy terrors, to the Hill The nobler Hill, whence hang our golden hopes. Not thee, contending with the clouds of earth, Not thee, scarr'd deeply with the change and chance Of earthly elements, not thee whose frame Is built on hidden gulfs of fire, we need: We seek the heavenly Sion: we are come Unto the city of the Living God, The innumerable company of saints And angels in their varying ministry, The general assembly and the Church Of all the first-born that are writ in heaven: And chief and crown and glory of them all, The Lord Who first went up the Mount of pain, Ere He ascended the celestial Hill. Thus from the earthly to the heavenly shrine, From Sinai on to Sion; from the realm Of awe and terror to the Land of Love:— When shall we wake, and waking, find us there? EGYPT. 1858. I. A midnight, such as ne'er before Was writ on history's page; To be proclaimed from shore to shore, And sung from age to age! Along each dim historic line Of giant statues, half divine, That lead toward the midmost shrine Of Egypt's sleeping kings, A fierce, wild gleam is on the air; The tramp of gathering hosts is there; The torch glows out with murky glare, And over many a forming square Unearthly radiance flings. For not with banner, not with shout, No warrior's pomp nor pride, At midnight did the Lord go out, And Egypt's firstborn died! II. O past the power of human speech, Past utterance of the song to teach,— How those granitic temples rise And gloom athwart the quiet skies; The moon, a pale and sickly disk, Looks down upon each obelisk, And throws a shadow gaunt and dim O'er lines of kingly Anakim, O'er human pomp and human pride, And human passions deified: All so unearthly, all so vast, All breathing of the mighty past. Here is the chieftain's latest bed Of old heroic story; The monarch, midst the monarch-dead, Reposes in his glory. III. But not with warrior's pomp and boast They marshal now, the midnight host: Far as the plots of verdure smile Down the green valley of the Nile, No cot, but on the midnight gale Pours out its grief, lifts up its wail; None, where the hot tear is not shed Upon the loved and first-born dead. In vain, poor mother, dost thou strive To keep that little spark alive: The Lord of Life, the Lord of Death Claims, for no fault of thine, his breath. It is that Egypt may be bent Before the King omnipotent: It is that Pharaoh's chiefs may own Jehovah God, and Him alone. In vain to strive, in vain to flee Thy king's resistless Foe: ‘I reck not of the Lord,’ saith he, ‘And Israel shall not go:’ The nation quails before the stroke The monarch's madness dared provoke. IV. Oh vainly warned! when Nile's great flood Rolled—miracle of fear!—with blood: When league past league, on either shore, Came ripples, thick with clotted gore, As if in vengeance on their foes The murdered innocents arose. Oh who may paint that fearful sky When clouds grew dark, and winds grew high, The day when threatened judgment came In sheets of mingled hail and flame! Upon the tender crop it drove, That sleet of solid ice; It shattered, in the idol-grove, The gods of man's device: All through the cavern's dim profound Echoed that thunder's mighty sound; And pealed and pealed again its roar Through sepulchre and corridor. Oh fearful judgment from on high With unresisted sway! The Lord is fighting from on high Against the sons of clay. V. Day comes again: but such a morn From Eastern clouds was never born, As when, from Afric's torrid sand, The desert-swarms, a monster band, Came pouring o'er that cursed land, That miserable race: Reference is made to the tradition of the Jews, corroborated by the Book of Wisdom (xvi. 3), that the swarms of Exod. viii. 20 were swarms of beasts, not of flies. With eyes that sparkled living fire, Monsters unknown and portents dire, Came hurrying on apace. Such visions, in the dead of night, Crowd o'er the sick man's aching sight, And, as he longs for morning light, In feverish dreams have place. O God, Whom all things serve alike, How many ways hast Thou to strike! How many means to overthrow And grind to dust Thy strongest foe! VI. On Goshen's land the morning broke In light, and life, and beauty; And blithely Goshen's sons awoke To toil in that day's duty: Upon the ripples of the Nile The Eastern sunbeams twinkled; And from the pasture-land the while The merry sheep-bells tinkled; In all its glory flowed along The old majestic river; And thanks arose in prayer and song To that day's Lord and Giver: The voice of children at the tank,— The shout of honest labour,— The feet that turned the water-crank Cheered up by pipe and tabor: The work goes on, the sport proceeds So gaily and so brightly; No insect skims, o'er water-weeds, More merrily and lightly. VII. Anguish, terror, woe and error, Over Zoan's people shed: Desolation fills the nation, 'Tis a city of the dead; All is fearful, all is lonely; Darkness, utter darkness only! Darkness, ink-like, pitchy darkness, Darkness making hearts to melt; Awful darkness, outer darkness, Darkness such as may be felt. Nature's self seems past and o'er, Darkness, darkness evermore. VIII. O hardened heart, that still provokes The Great Avenger's ceaseless strokes! The terror of nine plagues is past: And yet remains the worst and last. One fate on palace and on hall, On cottage and on shed: The firstborn stay and hope of all In one great night lies dead! Such night as never was before, Such night as never shall be more. Now Israel's ransomed tribes may go, Themselves thrust out in Egypt's woe: God bids: the mighty East wind blows The Red sea wave to sever; —This morn may ye behold your foes,— But not again for ever! IX. I tell not now the glorious night That saw Jeshurun's victor-flight: How on each side the sea stood high A rampart, azure as the sky: Above,—the light waves rippling hoary,— Beneath,—that wall's crystalline glory. Six hundred thousand chosen men Entered, at eve, that horrid glen: The cloudy pillar went before, The Lord's sure guide from shore to shore: While frenzied now, but unsubdued, All Egypt, man and horse, pursued. Nor tell I how, as on they wind, At midnight came the cloud behind, And cast unutterable woe Of terror on the advancing foe: And poured a radiance calm and bright O'er Israel, as on festal night. The monarch's heart with terror reels, Shrink back in awe the brave: The Lord struck off their chariot wheels That heavily they drave: Then, echoed by the stone-like sea, Rose the wild outcry,—‘Let us flee!’ Too late! too late! O man of God, Stretch out once more the mystic rod! In vain they bend their backward way, In vain retreat endeavour; Them Israel may behold to-day, But not again for ever. X. The battle hath been fought and won; The Lord hath dealt the blow: And gladly towards the rising sun The ransomed people go: And many a year and many an age Sweeps over Zoan's heritage, And many a chief of fame is hid Within the awful pyramid; But still, through circling times, the priests Serve ancient gods with ancient feasts, And worship still with honour due Osiris and his demon crew. Meanwhile Judæa's prophet-lays Foretel their fall in coming days; And Mede and Persian from afar Cry on the chace and urge the war With battle-axe and scymetar 'Gainst Egypt's rites divine: Down with the giant forms of old, Monarch and god together rolled: Nor spoil of gems, nor bribe of gold, Can save each idol-shrine. Morning may rise with purple wings; But never more shall float The sound which sun-touched Memnon flings, That sweet mysterious note: For shrine and temple are defaced In undistinguishable waste. XI. Let those who list it, rather sing The pride of Egypt's second spring: When buried learning rose again, And poets struck the venal strain; And girt with many a princely quay Fair Alexandria ruled the sea; Until her merchant flag was furled Before the Empress of the world: And Egypt felt the destined fate A patriarch's voice had spoke; And stooping from her princely state Received a victor's yoke: Long had that doom been writ above, When all the world was lost for love. XII. I rather turn from scenes like this To Him Whose woe hath wrought our bliss: Who left that high eternal throne To share our mortal lot: And when He came amidst His own His own received Him not. For not alone in Canaan's land His blessed Footsteps trod: But Egpyt's old benighted strand Received the coming God. No herald hastened to proclaim And blaze abroad His mighty name; No gathering clouds did honour meet, And bowed them down before His feet; An Infant snatched from blood and strife Seeks for the exile's wretched life: But never yet did nation bring Such welcome to a victor king. Allusion is made to the legend that, when our Lord entered the land of Egypt, every idol fell prostrate in its temple. He passed the boundary of the Land— She knew her Sovereign well: In every shrine from strand to strand The idol reel'd and fell: Their reign is o'er, their work is done: ‘From Egypt have I called My Son!’ XIII. Arm of the Lord that wast mighty of yore, What! is the day of thy victories o'er? Egypt and Egypt's innumerous force, Monarch and warrior, rider and horse, Dared in the steps of Thy people to tread,— Sank in the mighty abysses as lead! Fiercer than Pharaoh the monarch that now Bids to his idols Thine Israel bow: Come to their succour, O God, as of old! The following lines refer to the Tenth Persecution, which raged, perhaps, with greater fury in Egypt, than in any other part of the world. Wilt Thou not fight for the sheep of Thy fold? Let not him, counting our gain to be loss, Spurn at the Monarch Who died on the Cross: God of all victory! rise and lay low As in the days of past ages, the foe! XIV. He wills not, as in other days, Such trophies of His might to raise: Another war must now be tried, O follower of the Crucified! This is the triumph thou must win, To suffer, rather than to sin. All pangs to bear, all woes to dare, To yield thy lingering breath, And with the Son of God to share The highest victory, Death! XV. Thou canst not, impotent of heart, Tax as thou wilt thy demon-art, So much inflict, as, be thou sure, A Christian Martyr will endure. Go! bid the theatre be deck'd As for a festal day,— And try thou, if the Lord's elect Thy mandate will obey: Go! summon round the Cæsar's Throne Thy chosen ones to bend; The God of Hosts is with His own, And will be to the end. Command each cursed engine near,— A woman shews no woman's fear; The child a sea of pain may stem For that eternal diadem: They well may shame and woe despise Who have a mansion in the skies. XVI. The legend was told in the days of old, How the fifty wise men met; And in strength divine, Saint Katherine Was before the tribunal set. And she spake of the gods, (if gods they be, Whom we neither may love nor fear,) That have eyes indeed, but cannot see, That have ears, but cannot hear: And their power and their hate we may well contemn, Who can neither do good nor ill; And they that make them are like to them, In spite of their boasted skill: How the Cæsar sat on the judgment-seat, And called for the flame and the steel; And bade them bind her hands and feet Upon the tormenting wheel: But the lightning flashed, and the thunder rolled, By the God of Vengeance sent, And the fire descended, as once of old, And the wheel in pieces rent; And beautiful angels came down from on high, As in death she calmly lay, And bare her corpse to Mount Sinai In Arabia far away: And they laid her within the rock-hewn cave, For the days of her strife were o'er: And the church that arose above that grave Shall be famous evermore! XVII. Thus saith the legend that we deem A lovely and a pious dream; But this I doubt not—Angels' love Conveys them from the realm above, To succour those who nobly die A sacrifice to God on high: And doubly glorious, doubly blest Are they who take the martyr's rest. XVIII. Yes: and with many a martyr's fate Was Egypt's country dedicate. For the multitude of those who fled into the desert from the Egyptian persecution, and there perished, see Eusebius, H. E. viii. 13. They fled to many a cave and den, To many a waste and wild; They trod in many an unknown glen, —The mother and her child: And then they laid them down to sleep, The sleep that hath no ending; And there were none to wail and weep, Beside their bed attending: The lip of infants vainly pressed And marvelled at the clay-cold breast, Until the soul, so free from stain, So loving and so tender, That dear, dear mother joined again In heaven's eternal splendour. XIX. O day of woe! O fearful loss When to the Crescent bowed the Cross! When Islam's swarms spread far and wide Where Athanasius toiled and died; And bade the foul impostor teach Where Cyril's lips were wont to preach. From Europe pour'd, in endless tide, The followers of the Crucified, And three times battling, three times foiled, At length for Zoan's land they toiled. They marshall 'neath the saintly king Who rules his happy France; Reference is made to the Crusade of S. Louis, and its admirable description by the Sieur de Joinville. It is a glorious gathering Of pennon and of lance: So brave and loving is that soul, So noble in its self-control, So snowy pure, that it may be Well emblemed by its fleur-de-lys. And Islam's sons are gathering fast, And Islam's shout is on the blast; And Almoadan's royal brow With fear and woe is furrowed now: And either chief his battle sets In front of Cairo's minarets. XX. The long, long day went wearily; The long, long night went drearily: Upon each tent, from the hot sky sent, The sunbeams fell intensely: Above the camp the evening damp And fever-fog rose densely: With the stagnant wave the canal was foul That the Christian army bounded; And at night the screech of the sad screech-owl O'er the Christian army sounded: When the sun went down o'er the waste of brown, In mingled sand and cloud, There were forms, men said, of woe and dread, Of coffin and hearse and shroud: Then stalked the plague from tent to tent Throughout the Christian armament: A plague by fetid marshes sown, A plague by human skill unknown, A plague that sapped, by slow decay, Each power of life and soul away: And bred, where'er its anguish ran, Corruption in the living man. XXI. O king! the King of kings denies That Cairo's towers shall be thy prize: This be thy triumph,—to endure Unmoved thy tribulations; This be thy victory,—to ensure God's own blest crown of patience: Unsway'd by proffered rope or sword, Unless the Prophet be adored; By threat of torture vainly tried Except thou spurn the Crucified. Think not the foe can e'er prevail, Albeit as victor greeted; Think not, although thy battles fail, That thou canst be defeated! XXII. In westering clouds the sun is hid; Eve gathers round the pyramid: The twilight flings a parting smile Upon the broad and glorious Nile: The sunset breezes rise, and shed Soft music from the palm-tree's head; And one light boat with sail and oar Hath crossed the stream and gained the shore. —Yes: nowhere else can evening cast Such great reflections of the past, As where she glimmered round the path Of Joseph and of Asenath; Bade Israel's children cease from toil, Or saw them rich with Pharaoh's spoil. —'Tis gone and o'er. I would the strain That hath call'd up the past again, And told of that Almighty Hand So oft stretched out on Zoan's strand, And tried, too boldly, to relate Each change and chance of human fate, Were worthier, land of God! to be A record of the past and thee! A further Prize was adjudged to these hexameters. Monarch of ages, the First and the Last, Whose measureless vision Joining the Past and the Future in one, (where as infinite rivers, Here, in a moment of time, their two eternities mingle,) This by Thy Saints hast writ, and that by Thy Prophets foretellest; Oh what a moment of time, what a brief-told span of existence Thou hast appointed for man! Though he mete out the path of the comet, Measure the depths of the sea, and number the stars of the heaven, Triumph o'er time, and annihilate space! If his years Thou hast shortened Since their duration at first, 'twas not harshly, O God, nor severely;— Who in the passage to Life, (for what is this life but a passage Out of the storm into calm, to our own dear Country from exile, Into the region of joy from the kingdom of sorrow,) would linger? There is the goal of our race, the reward and the end of our contest; There is the happy array of the souls made perfect through suffering: There is the realm where tempests are not,—where Paradise blossoms, Where God's Noon is eternal, and God's own Spring everlasting. Oh how they beckon us on,—those former and earthly companions Who have put off the corruptible now, and assumed the eternal,— Oh how they call us away from this earth's poor lures and enticements, Perishing when at the brightest, no sooner enjoyed than departed! This is the voice of their love, as they point to the infinite future, —“Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection!” Yet would I fain,—(for autumnal repose and the glory of sunset Call back the years that are gone in thoughts not gloomy but solemn,) Now that, a monarch in death, the great sun draws to his setting, Decking the earth with his beauty and kindling the sky with his splendour, Fain would I turn to the realm of the past; that marvellous kingdom Where, when the midnight shall come, this day, now dying in beauty, Shall, in the grave of years, be written for ever and ever.— What is the line of monarchs that, far as can history venture, Looms on th' horizon, a band so ghost-like and shadowy—monarchs Passing in godlike array athwart the shadows that cradle Time in his awful departure from out of eternity's bosom? Mighty indeed that race, and mighty its memories, rising In the green vale of the Nile, the dead midst the living around them: Temples august in their granite, and calm great obelisks, soaring Up from the earth and its din, and statues, huge and majestic, Statues of deified monarchs, or king-like gods, may I name them? There is his last long sleep, the Chief and the Priest and the Father, Heart of the shrine and its worship: himself in cornice and passage, Trampling the proud in his wrath, or raising the meek in his mercy: There in the pillar sublime, the lawgiver seated in judgment Executes justice for all: there lastly, as earth is departing, Gently received by the gods as a god, was his earthly entombment. Spring should come down on the fields, and summer should fade into autumn, Thousand-fold thousands of times, (so intended the skill of the builder,) While, in the midst of the shrine, undisturbed, untended, decayless, Sleeping the infinite sleep, the monarch reposed in his glory. None should behold those walls, none gaze on the wild decorations, Sacred to silence and night, till the king should awake from his slumbers, Then, when the earth and sky should be mingled together in ruin. Who hath o'erthrown those temples? Who scattered in measureless fragments Idol, and pillar, and sphinx into heaps of eternal confusion, Dashing the statues of kings into grinning deformity, mingling Granite, and marble, and clay with the fierce wild sweep of a whirlwind? Tremble, ye idols of Egypt! The mighty avenger approaches: Tremble, ye priests of the stock and the stone; let them rise, let them save you, If they have ears for your prayers, if victims and hymns be availing! Where are the soldiers of yore? Let the long, long lines of the archers Stand in the front of the war; let them shoot, as they shot at Megiddo, 2 Chron. xxxv. 22, 23. When to the grave of his youth they hurried the ruler of Sion, Him that was faithful alone in a faithless and ill generation. Vainly they marshal for battle: the shout of the Mede and the Persian Daunting each spirit, and chilling each sense, grows louder and louder: Bel boweth down to his fate, and Nebo stoopeth to ruin. Laden with gold and with jewels the camels are treading the desert, Weary with those vast loads of capital, cornice, and pillar, Destined to serve in the victor's abode. Hence, ruin on ruin; Hence, when the sun sinks low, and the purple and African desert Glows as the steel on the anvil,—the long slant rays of the sunbeam, Mournfully gilding the ruin, makes sadder the sad desolation. Music is hushed in those halls; the voice of the bride and the bridegroom Never shall echo again; no light of a candle shall glimmer; Beasts of the desert are there, and owls in their desolate places. Marvellous still is the scene, though its youth and its strength have departed: Man may pass by and his works, but the flow of the stream is eternal: ? immota labascunt: Et quæ perpetuo sunt agitata, manent. Fanus Vitalis. Cradled in silence, and lapped in obscurity, onward and onward Winding or forcing its way through dim and impassable mountains, Peaks unknown and untrodden, mysterious Crophi and Mophi, Herodotus, II. 28. ?????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??? ????????, ??? ?????, ??? ???????????? ???????? ?? ????? ????? ??????, ?? ???, ?????, ?? ??, ????. Then, in convulsion and jar, with writhing and feverish waters, Struggling and panting along, where the cataract, wonderful portal, Opens its beautiful way thro' the fair green valley of Egypt. Egypt, unchanged and unchangeable land! since the days of thy glory Oh what mutation of earth, what rise and extinction of nations! There where the forest primeval was stretched, with the gnarl of its branches Shadowing acre on acre, a deep green ocean of verdure, Commerce hath wedded together the flame and the water, combining City and city in one; and with more than the speed of the lightning Darting, o'er mountain and vale, the thought and the word and the action. There, by the deep sea-shore, where was nought but the wearisome ripple, Hour after hour, of the wave, and the lonesome scream of the sea-gull, Now is the clang of the dock, the voice of the mallet and hammer, Clamping and clenching the planks that shall ride the queen of the ocean. Thou wast the same, O land of the past! thy obelisks pointed Up to the noontide sun,—thy sphinxes, in terrible beauty, Guarded the shrine and its gate, when Ishmael's merchantmen entered Bearing their spices and myrrh, and leading the captive and bondman, Him that was sold from the pit in the distant valley of Dothan. Strong in the strength of thy God, be faithful amidst the unfaithful; Bear yet awhile that dungeon! A mightier captive than thou art, Suffers in type with thee; He is taken from prison and judgment, Yet in the end to the throne, the eternal throne is exalted! —Beautiful season of old, when down and valley and hillside Yielded a place for his flocks, while the great oak, stretching her branches Over the greensward round, was the Patriarch's home for a season. Here was the light tent pitch'd, the earth gave treasure of water: Here was the altar erected to God: while pastoral princes Came with their proffer of peace, and knelt at the shrine of El-Bethel. Gen. xxxv. 7. Now for awhile farewell to the plain of beautiful Canaan: God hath commanded, Advance! O'er the earth the famine is raging; Only in Zoan is food: and with visions of peace and of plenty Happier tidings arrive,—too happy at first for reception, ‘Joseph is yet alive; is alive, and is Lord over Egypt! Bravely the brave old man goes forth with the tribes of the future: Casting his all upon God, Whose word is his light and his waymark Now, as in years long past: ‘for certainly I will be with thee; ‘I will go down with thy steps, and again will bring thee to Canaan.’ Thus, when an evening of calm, succeeding the day of the tempest, Pours through the rifts of the clouds the marvellous glory of sunset, Gilding each hard dark edge, and melting the mist into silver; Then earth sends to the sky her great oblation of incense; Sparkles the tree and the flower; the birds chant gladly their Vespers; Greener the green mead glows, more azure the blue of the æther:— Thus is the calm fair end of a life so chequered with chances. Now o'er the waste of the sand he beholds the pyramids gleaming; Now is enwrapped in those dear, dear arms: now Goshen the happy, Goshen the best of the land, the home of the future, is round him. Year after year rolls on; the little ones bloom into youthood, Youth into man's ripe strength, and the full ripe vigour of manhood Melts into eld: while still, the Prince and the Priest of his people, Jacob awaits his call; and expects the repose of the righteous. When shall the season draw nigh,—the season foretold? What chieftain Bursting the dungeon and loosing the chain, shall deliver Jeshurun? Arm of the Lord! it is time to awake: the bondage is bitter, Heavy and sore is the yoke wherewith they burden Thy people! Is not Thine own word pledged, that years four hundred and thirty Rolling away, shall redeem Thy flock? O remember Thy promise; Think of the Saints of the past: of the Saints, O God of the living, Dwelling with Thee in the peace of Thy home, and deliver their children! Oh what a night was that, what a night to be ever recorded, When from the seat of the Lord went forth the Mandate of Judgment! When the Eternal Word, Wisdom xviii. 15, 16. as a warrior armed for the slaughter, Leapt from his throne, and stood on the earth, but reached to the heaven! Death in the courts of the palace, and death in the hut of the bondman: Everywhere, everywhere, death. The sad low wail of the firstborn Hangs on the midnight air, while the pitiless angel of sorrow Stays not and knows not to spare. No avail in the skill of physician; Vain is the prayer of devotion, and vain the voice of affection. But, in the Lord's own land, with the Lord's own people, is gladness, Where the mysterious blood is sprinkled on lintel and doorpost, Warding the stroke of death. They eat the mystical supper, Standing, and sandalled, and hasty of mien, and girt for departure. (So, when the world and its deeds shall be o'er, when the angel of judgment Summons the quick and the dead, woe! woe! where the Paschal Oblation Hath not besprinkled each soul,—thence writ with the reprobate people!) Now there is forming of lines, and the blast of the trumpet at midnight; Torches glare out in the streets; they marshal by tribes and by houses: Borrow ye jewels of gold, saith the Lord, and jewels of silver; As she hath spoil'd, so let her be spoil'd: oppress the oppressor: Gather the double of all, in the hour of her just retribution. Hurriedly sweeps the array, where the voice of the ruler directs it, Billow on billow, instinct with life: still onward and onward Take they the desolate way of the wild, by Succoth and Etham. Who shall protect them now? The chariots and horses of Egypt Thunder behind, and the deep is before, and the wail of the trumpet, Prancing of steeds, and shout of the foe, wax louder and louder. Then from the Throne of God, that Throne, where the weary have refuge, Where in the midst of distress there is calm, that mandate was uttered, —Mandate not uttered alone that day for the thousands of Judah,— But to all ages addressed, and to all generations, “Go forward!” Forward, when all seems lost, when the cause looks utterly hopeless; Forward, when brave hearts fail, and to yield is the rede of the coward; Forward, when friends fall off, and enemies gather around thee; Thou, though alone with thy God, though alone in thy courage, Go forward! Nothing it is with Him to redeem or by few or by many: Help, though deferred, shall arrive; ere morn the night is at darkest. Oh what a wonderful sight, as the wild sea, hither and thither, Piled itself up, and was raised in a heap! A horror of gladness Thrilled through the host, as, on this side and that, the obedient water Stood like an adamant wall, with a dark, deep valley below it: Valley, where coralline trees stretched out their branches of beauty. But on each face of the pile, so glassy and golden together, Now (for it drew to the eve) were the westering sunbeams reflected. Yea, in what marvellous tints, through the very abyss of the ocean, Struck they and pierced they and lingered! What hues of crimson and jasper Shaded away, or commingling, led onward and onward the vision Into the far sea depth! what soft and violet pulses Quivered afar through the mass, instinct with glory and splendour! Marvels unknown till then: for till then never had Nature Opened the sea-nymphs' hall, and revealed the palace of ocean. Tribes of the Lord, advance! the Pillar of Cloud is before you! Go, where your God shall lead! And night hath come down in her blackness. Only the deep tramp, tramp of the hosts, and the shout of the captains, Neighing of steeds, and thunder of car. Now woman and childhood Wearily, wearily drag their steps; while fiercer and gladder, Deeming the prey in their clutch, press on those thousands of Egypt. Woe for the faint and the few! When lo! the pillary vapour, (Just as the midnight divides the departing day from the morrow,) Hitherto leading the van, now fearfully swoops to the rearward, Right between host and host. On Zoan ineffable terror Poured from that horrible cloud, as its congregate masses of blackness Swirled through the labouring air: but gladness and glory on Judah, Such as the Presence of God streams down on the Seats of the Blessed. Glowed in its radiance the host: glowed banner and armour and buckler; Squadron and line of advance glowed out: on the watery bulwark Flickered and trembled the broken array and fragments of splendour. Ah! but the Form! That Form that looked on the army of Egypt Forth from the pillar of cloud, to distract and to madden and frenzy? Then fell terror on hearts that till then never had trembled: Then blanched lips that had never grown pale: the chariots of Memphis Heavily, heavily, heavily drave: their wheels were shattered; Blended were horse and foot. ‘Let us flee! let us flee!’ was the outcry: ‘Back, for the Lord is with them and battles against the Egyptian!’ Woe, for the word Too late! Ah, bitterly, bitterly uttered, Then when the harvest is past, and the summer is ended for ever! One little moment of time, one brief imperceptible second, Closes the portal of hope: Here, none but the desperate enter! Back on the wreck of the host rush down those mighty abysses; Back on the king and the prince; back, back on the horse and the rider: One wild shriek of despair; and then that silence for ever. Oh for the vision that once came down by the river of Chebar, Ezekiel i. 3. Teaching the Son of Man of past and present and future! Then with a pencil of light might I picture the course of the ages Such as the pyramids saw! By the mouth of the River of Egypt Rises the merchant queen, that had sway o'er the sea of the inland. Over the tideless waves went forth those vessels of commerce, Visiting island and port, as far as the Pillars of Atlas; Yea, with undaunted prow stemming boldly against the Atlantic, Coasting the shores of the West, till they entered the Bay of Ulysses: Ulyssipolis, that is, Lisbon. Or, more adventurous still, their carved beak turned to the southward, Anchored they under Madeira, the sweetest Isle of the Ocean. Learning awakes from her sleep where the Ptolemy wieldeth the sceptre; Echo again some few faint strains of the poets of Hellas; Though the sweet source of the song be dried, still harmony lingers, Oh how poor, how faint, how weak, ere dying for ever! Now o'er the land of the Nile is the Western Eagle triumphant; Now is the mart of the earth, and the world's great granary, Roman; Marvellous change! But a change more marvellous time in its fulness Hurries along; when the Cross shall o'erthrow the altars of Egypt; When to the Name and the fame of the Crucified dedicate, temples Shall in the city lift up their head; in the desolate places Hallow the soil that was once the domain and abode of Osiris. Oh what a fight to the death! What glorious conflict of martyrs! Oh what a struggle of Satan! What rage and despair of the fiend-gods! When to the rack men went, as the victor might go to a triumph, Hugging each engine of pain as a bride; in the theatre stood they Waiting the rush and the roar of the beast, that terrible passage Up to the Vision and Glory of God, the Sight Beatific. Tier upon tier rose high with the pitiless multitude crowded: Præfect and Consulars sat where the silken and delicate awning Shielded the noon-day sun; beneath, in the very arena, He that is Martyr of martyrs again was crowned in His servant. Nor with the steel and the torture alone was the battle decided: Into the wilds they fled, to the desert and cavern and mountain, Dying of hunger and thirst, the babe and the mother together, Leaving their bones to whiten, a prey to the vulture and jackal; Till in the day, when the Lord shall descend in His terror to judgment, They shall obey His voice and be glorious for ever and ever. —This is the way that they fought, those heroes of Christ and His Kingdom; This is the way that they conquered, by toil and by patient endurance: Therefore they now are before His Seat, where the River of Pleasure Springs from the Throne of the Lamb That was slain, as glassy as crystal; Where there is no more curse, but on either side of the River Groweth the Tree of Life with her twelve fruits, each in their season; Where they shall see His Face, and His Name shall be in their foreheads. Now is the battle-array that shall crush or the Cross or the demon; Where in the great sea-square of the merchant city of princes, Rises the idol on high, that ancient idol, Serapis, See the story in Socrates, H. E. V. 16. Doomed to be struck to the earth,—so saith the command of the Cæsar. —Who hath the courage to deal that blow? For the prophets of Egypt Tell, when that image shall fall, how the sky and the ocean shall mingle, Darkness shall cover the world, and nature return into chaos. “Give me an axe,” saith a firm brave voice. And the multitude cower, Trembling and shrinking together, and deem that the end is approaching. “Strike in the Name of the Lord!” And the idol trembles and totters: Down with it, down to the ground! It falls, but a marvellous thunder Echoes within that frame. Great terror is over the people; Till from their ancient abode, in myriad, myriad numbers, Pours forth a cohort of rats. Then peals of measureless laughter; ‘These be thy gods, O Egypt!’ The landscape of history darkens: Pour from the tents of the East his hordes, the Impostor of Mecca: Glows in the front of their van a land like the Garden of Eden: Blackens behind their rear a howling and terrible desert. Now is the land of the Nile yet again the servant of servants, Mighty in thoughts of the past alone: while the fabrics of ages Sadly and dimly look down on the hopes and the schemes of the future. Relics of Pharaoh's renown, how strangely they blend and commingle Into the present, the great highways of peace and of commerce, Where from our country are sent her commands to the world of the Sunrise, Where from the sea to the sea go forth the telegraph flashes! Lord of the Past and the Future, Whom history preaches and blesses, Who by Thy wisdom uphold'st Thine own through the perils of this world! Still, when a Pharaoh attacks, raise up for Thy people a Moses; Still let the Red Sea wave be a path of escape for Thy Ransomed; Still through the desert lead on, still sever the waters of Jordan; Till they obtain, at the last, their promised inheritance, Canaan! THE DISCIPLES AT EMMAUS. 1859. Why from the western clouds walks Evening forth In such transcendent hues? Why sinks the Sun Behind Judæa's hills, in such array Of golden majesty, that never yet Eneglaim's Ezekiel xlvii. 10. “The fishers shall stand upon it”—the Dead Sea— “from Engedi even unto Eneglaim.” fisher saw that sullen lake Clad in such living purple as to-day? That Bethlehem's shepherd—(as he shades his eyes, And marks how Light and Beauty interweave Their delicate threads of opal in the West Round those strong bars of crimson,)—lifts his heart, And blesses God Who made the world so fair? —O Nature, cursed of old for man's offence! O God's Creation, once so beautiful, So perfect in thy beauty,—since defiled By man's defiler!—well thou may'st to-day Gird thee with festal splendour, tire thy brow With living light, and pour thy beauty forth! Now the first time, the very first of all, The great sun sets upon a ransomed earth: Sees man redeem'd, and God victorious: sees Captivity led captive, Death by death O'erwhelm'd, and Life out-bursting from the Grave. There is one spot, a spot the Angels know, —O touch it gently, thou red messenger Of beauty from the West! with softest kiss Salute each hallow'd blade! It now is clad With evening's gems, but three days since was decked With that tremendous dew of Blood, which spake The death-throes of an agonizing God: 'Twas there the strife began: there face to face He stood, Whose purer eyes abhor all guilt, With heap'd-up centuries of transgression, crime Of untold generations, stretching back To that first sin that lost us Paradise And brought in death,—and forwards, length'ning out In vista, hideous and more hideous yet, To the last deed of violence that shall be Before the Archangel's Trumpet! And He knelt With Head bow'd down on that most holiest spot, That anchorage of every soul,—and said, If it be possible,—oh prayer thrice breathed In Agony that only God can know!— Let this cup pass away: yet not My Will But Thine be done.—And where were mortals then? Where were the Victor's glory? where the Name Exalted o'er all names of things in Heav'n, And things on earth, and things beneath the earth: The One, the Only Name wherein is life And strength and love and comfort? Aye! exult, Exult, O Sun, and leap for joy, O Earth! Oh how transfigured now, since, three days erst, Sweet light extinct at high noon, dim eclipse Dragged on, o'er mountain range and desert sand, And labouring ox, and bright spring beds of flowers, And young green woods, the funeral pall of God: What time the Athenian sage, Allusion is made to the well-known tale that S. Dionysius the Areopagite burst forth into such an exclamation when observing the miraculous eclipse at our Blessed Lord's Crucifixion. amidst the band Of pale disciples, shiv'ring in their fear, “Or this world's God is suffering, or the frame “Of this world's self,” he said, “is breaking up!” What time—for some believe the marvellous tale, The story of Tamois is related by Plutarch in his work on the Cessation of Oracles: and Tiberius is by that author said to have enquired into the truth of the tale from the lips of Tamois himself.— His vessel bounding o'er the wine-dark sea, The pilot Tamois heard that voice,—“Whene'er “Thy galley nears Phalacrum's stormy cape, “Proclaim thou from the prow,—‘Great Pan is dead!’” Nay! speed the vessel! spread all canvas! woo Each favouring breeze, and fly the dangerous coast! —Vain human forethought! vain the seaman's art! Soon as the white cliff beetles o'er the deep, Fails the fair breeze: the sails droop idly down: And Tamois, now a bowshot from the coast, Afraid to disobey, yet loth to speak, Makes proclamation that Great Pan is dead. At once, ten thousand thousand hideous cries And doleful lamentations,—whispered bans Of unseen things that flap their spirit-wings And gibber through the air, and make it sad With woe and wailing. These infernal Powers Have learnt the enigmatic lore, and know Their human empire fall'n.—The breeze springs up; The vessel onward flies: and queenly Rome Hath heard, nor understood, the wondrous tale. Oh pleasant pilgrimage, where arching boughs Talk to each other, and the breeze,—of spring With all its soft young beauty! There the fig Puts forth its milky leaves—the cactus there Bristles with oar-like petals; while the copse Echoes the bulbul's full delicious notes, And all is vernal joy.—But who are these, Twain pilgrims, as it seems, that, slow and sad, Leaving the Holy City, and the pile Of snowy glory, tow'ring o'er the abyss On this side and on that, majestic shrine Of prayer for nations, where the Paschal Feast As yet invites to worship, wend their way To fair Emmaus?—Hark! their talk, the while, Is of a King, esteemed the Son of God, Who yet hath yielded to the Law of Man: Is of a great Deliverer, That could save Others, it seems, but could not save Himself: Is of a mighty Prophet, That could stay Diseases by a word, could bid the sea Boiling in maddest fury, to be still, Command the fiends that torture human frames Back to their place of torment, yea, restore Lord of the gates of hell, the dead to life: Their guide, their friend, their ruler. Where are now His promises of Love? Where now their hopes Of many mansions in His Father's House? Their Head is gone,—their visions fled,—for He, By most unrighteous judgment doom'd, hath died That shameful death, the malefactor's Cross, Accounted with transgressors: yea, to-day Is the third day since all these things were done. What is to them the splendour of the sky, The loveliness of spring?—The sun that sets So glorious now, shall rise more glorious still; The flowers that died in autumn, have assumed Their newer life, and every tinted leaf Opes its young channel to the verdurous sap. For Him is no awak'ning, till the hour Of Heavenly right, reversing earthly wrong; The Resurrection of the latter day. Oh happy hours of converse, when He spake As man spake never! Oh dear fields and paths Trod by those blessed feet, thenceafter nailed Fast to the bitter Cross! Oh pleasant skies Of blue Gennesaret! obedient waves Whose midnight surges into peace He trod! Him by what name must they remember now, Or Son of God, or Son of Man? If this, Woe to those hopes whose aim is based on clay! If that,—can He, the Immortal, taste of death, The impassible, of suffering? He that holds The Heaven of Heavens in that Almighty grasp Be held within the grave?— Methought that now In this spring landscape there were pilgrims twain: And lo! a third is with them; Who draws near With salutation sweet yet grave, and asks The cause that hath set sadness on their brow. “Hast thou not heard,—or hast thou stood aloof From all the Paschal pilgrims,—of the things That these last days have brought to every ear?” “What things?” that Stranger asks. And straight the tide Of mingled hope and fear and love breaks forth: How they had hoped that He Who fed the crowds, Who heal'd the sick, Who still'd the waves, Who held The keys of hell and death, had been the King, Jeshurun's promised Monarch: He Whose Throne Should stretch its sceptred sway from shore to shore, Yea from the river to the world's confine: To Whom all kings should bow, Whom every power Should own supreme, we trusted it was He! We trusted,—till our hopes were nail'd to that, The self-same Cross whereon our Master hung. Yea certain of our company, who bare No woman's heart with more than woman's love, Were early at the tomb, whereat they saw A vision of the Seraphs; and they asked, Why seek ye thus the Living midst the dead? The Angels they beheld, and we, who went Wing'd with their tale, beheld them too: but Him, The Angels' Monarch, saw we not. “O fools And slow of heart,” that Stranger said, “who thus Reject the teaching of prophetic lore! And ought not He, the Anointed, to have trod The path of suffering first, ere He assumed The exceeding glorious and eternal Crown? Ought He not first to breast the howling waves Amidst the night of this world, ere at length The morn now come, Compare S. John xxi. 4. “But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore:” which is usually applied by the Fathers to the shore of Heavenly rest, and the morning of the Resurrection. He stands upon the shore? What other lesson taught they, since of old, Ere yet the cherubim with fiery sword Had guarded Eden's entrance, God's great love Promised the Woman's Seed That was to reign, But not before He suffered,—He shall bruise The serpent's head, but thou shalt bruise His heel? Why else were all their labours, who were made Types of the Promised Ruler, but for this? Why trod he wearily the three days' march, The long-sought offspring, “Isaac, whom thou lov'st,” And bare the fire, and bare the wood, but not The lamb for the burnt-offering: he that lamb Bound on the Altar, while above his son That glorious father bared the trembling knife? Why else the thousand victims, pouring out Their meek and patient lives, and offering up Their innocence for offences not their own, While o'er their death rang trumpet peal and shawm, The psaltery and the cymbal? Oh vast roof Radiant with gems and gold! oh dim-seen forms Of Angels brooding o'er the Mercy Seat! Why on that dreadest hour, that fast of fasts, The Day of Great Atonement, went the Priest Into the Holy of the Holies, where In its unutterable majesty God's own Shechinah burn'd? Why else the tale Of Israel's champions, victors by defeat; Through bondage and through exile and contempt, And midnight march, and flight of peril, raised, The good fight fought, to Salem's peaceful throne?” —Oh how He spake, that Stranger! how His words Roll'd off the darkness from the byegone times S. Luke xxiv. 27. “He expounded unto them, in all the Scriptures, the things concerning Himself.” Hence, in the present poem, some of the types are described at length, on which our Blessed Lord may be supposed more particularly to have dwelt. And touch'd them with prophetic light! He shewed The plain beneath Mount Carmel, Gideon, a type of Christ. Judges vii. 16—21. where the glow Of thousand thousand watchfires lighted up The stilly midnight, while the warrior sons Of Edom and of Midian slept the sleep Of glutted insolence, and dreamed of spoil Won from a morrow richer than to-day. But what the arms of God's elected chief And of his brave three hundred? Not the sword And spear and shield, the warrior's earthly guard; But pitchers, moulded by the potter's art, And lamps within the pitchers: “What I do, That see that ye do also.” Then the cry, “The sword of Gideon and of God!” the crash Of shattered pitchers, and the glare that burst Upon the midnight host; while round and round, Now here, now there, that shout's great thunder rose, “The sword of God and Gideon!”—Even thus, Almighty Conqueror, didst Thou seek the foe Amidst the night of this world: even thus, The mortal vessel shattered gloriously, Flash'd forth the Godhead! Yea, and they that bear Thy Name, must do Thy deeds: must freely yield This mortal frame to anguish and to death, If this Thy call, and fear not them that kill, And after that have nought that they can do: Oh glorious lot of Martyrs!—Yet not less They tread His footsteps, who for Him endure A life-long death; who spend and who are spent In labour, mocked at by the world,—in strife Both with the ill within them and without: In self-denial that, by slow degrees, Wearing the mortal vessel out, at length Shall unimprison the internal light. Anon He led them in His god-like talk To Dagon's temple, Samson, a type of Christ. Judges xvi. 25—30. where the shouting crowd Bade the imprisoned warrior make them sport; Captive, and blind, and fettered, there he stands, A spectacle of woe; yet none the less Retains the unconquerable will, to die Himself, and by his death destroy the foe. On those twain pillars of the house he leans, And makes his prayer: “Remember me, O God, This once, O God, and strengthen me this once, Only this once, that I may be avenged, And with the dying Philistines may die.” One lengthened hideous tug, and down they come, The pillars of the temple, crashing in On those besotted thousands. So the dead His death, were more than those his life, destroyed. —Not less, O glorious Captive, didst Thou hang A spectacle to angels, on that Cross, The watch-tower of the world, the whilst Thy hands, Nailed to its bitter wood, for us burst through The fetters of damnation, crushed for us By death the reign of death, and brought forth life; Life without sickness, life without end, life Such as the angels live, and next to God. Still were those travellers' ears attent, although The westering sun gave warning that the eve Must send the latest incense of her flowers, The latest music of her birds, to heaven. Forthwith that unknown Friend—(for friend He was, Who poured in comfort on the orphaned men, As holy morn pours light and warmth and joy On utter darkness)—shifts the scene, and shows Philistia's hosts and Israel's, face to face Stretched in the valley of the Terebinth, David, a type of Christ. 1 Sam. xvii. 1 Sam. xvii. 2. “The valley of Elah:” rather “of the Elah,” that is, of the Terebinth tree. And shouting for the battle. Hope on those, Secure of victory, sits: these sullen shame Weighs down, and fear that dares not tempt defeat. For lo! the enormous champion tow'rs along, Matchless in brutal strength, sole relic now Of those gigantic demigods who erst Held sway o'er Canaan. How he belches forth Words of fierce scorn and bitter biting jeers Against the people of the Lord Most High, Against the Lord Himself!—But why repeat That tale of nursery-faith, “Twined to the people's pious nursery-faith.”—Wallenstein. which infants hear Half-pleased, half-frightened, while the firelight throws Fantastic shadows round them, and the wind Goes rioting forth upon the Sunday Eve Of howling Mid-November! They the while Pillow their head upon the Mother's breast, And in that warm white nest shut out the sight Of great Goliath, and the brazen glare Of shield and sword and terrible weaver's beam. A tale of nursery-lore: yet tale fulfilled In its deep strength, when He, the Infant, born In David's City, Bethlehem, went to meet The fierce Goliath of the human race. But not as warriors go, with noise confused, Isaiah ix. 5. And garments rolled in blood; with captains' shout And thunder of the battle: but despised, A poor man midst the poor, He gently dropped His Majesty, the friend of sinners still; Till in the final conflict, drinking first The brook of deep affliction by the way, Psalm cx. 7. He conquered; with Goliath's sword cut off The slaughter of Goliath with his own sword, so continually taken by early commentators, of death destroyed by death. Goliath's head, by toil abolished toil, By woe wiped off all tears, by death slew death, By rising, raised us to eternal life. Thus called He up the champions, one by one, Whose mortal course prefigured His, the Christ's: And cheered those faithful two by many a proof That He must suffer ere He reigned.—But then, Just as the sun went down beneath the hills, He touched the “more sure word of prophecy:” How David, in his ecstasy, Psalm xxii. beheld Messiah's Agony,—the hands and feet Pierced by the bitter nails; the frame so racked; Each member so distorted; gall His meat, And vinegar His drink. And next to him, The son of Amoz told his sadder tale: He is rejected and despised of men, A man of sorrows and acquaint with grief: And we esteemed Him not: His face was marred More than the sons of men;—'twas marred for us; For surely, surely, He hath borne our griefs And carried all our sorrows! Isaiah liii. He in death Was with the malefactor, but His grave Among the rich and noble. Come thou forth, O Daniel! Daniel ix. 26, 27. and declare the time, ordained Before the world was, when to save that world, Messiah for its guilt shall be cut off. The seventy weeks are ended: needs must Christ Have entered on His Work.—The twelve-fold band Repeat the self-same tale,—from him that sank, Gulphed in that ocean-shouldering monster's maw, Down to the bottom of the mountains,—thence Called up from black despair, to light and joy,— To him who hailed the Conqueror o'er the Grave, Hosea xiii. 14.— Death! I will be thy Death! (Oh glorious song! Repeat it, Earth, with all thy thousand tongues, And hail it, Heaven!) O Grave, behold and own Thy great Destroyer! Thus that Stranger spoke: And as He spoke, a glorious vision brake Upon the twain. As when the pilgrim gropes His doubtful way through thunder-fog and mist Down terrible Y Wyddfa, Y Wyddfa: “The Conspicuous;” the highest point of Snowdon.—where each step Is peril, where each pause is utter doubt, And error is destruction,—if perchance The western breeze lifts off that vaporous skirt High from the double summit, then each range Of circling mountains laughs in sunlit joy, While the clear path shoots downward, and below Basks sweet Llanberris in the summer eve:— So from their souls fled agony and doubt, And in its stead came love and joy and peace, And their hearts burnt within them. They meanwhile Have reached their journey's goal; a peasant's cot Where myrtle breathes out fragrance, and the snow Of orange bloom alternates with the gold Of the ripe fruit, while vines, from elm to elm, Fling the young beauty of their tendrils out. “Abide with us,” they say; “the day is spent; “Abide with us, and rest.” He set His Face Towards the upland slope, where yet abide The sentinels of twilight: still they urge Redoubling their petition. As He yields, The board is spread: and at the frugal meal They stand, and give God thanks: then sit and eat. Nay! mark that Stranger now! He taketh bread, He blesseth, and He breaketh. And their eyes Are opened, and they know 'Him! It is He, The Lord of Whom they spake: the Lord That died, And rose again; and lives for evermore. And He hath vanished! Oh to see Him yet! “Did not our hearts burn in us as He shewed How Moses and the Prophets speak of Him, His Death and Victory?”—That same hour they rise, And lighted by the Paschal Moon, that now Floods holy Olivet with trembling light, Wend back towards the City. There the Eleven Had met this eve in silence and in fear, With doors fast locked, lest enemies intrude. Two days agone, “Though all men,” was their boast, “Reject Thee and deny Thee, yet not we:” And they forsook the first!—And what if now They who forgat Him be by Him forgot? What if the golden chain of love be snapped?— Nay, never, never deem it! This His Law: Loving His own, He loves them to the end. Meanwhile, up hill, through copse, down vale, they go Where lately He was with them: on they press With this one yearning hope, to tell the tale That shall remove all fear and end all doubts. Now they have reached the portal, now they meet The challenge of the soldier: now they tread The dim and silent city streets, and gain The upper room, that kernel of the Church. And lo! they hear the tale they thought to tell: “The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared To Simon!” O the joy of joys! O Day Blest beyond all days! Portal to the sky! The golden ladder, lifting man to God! And Thou,—what tongue can tell Thy praise?—what heart, Bursting in thankfulness, can sing Thy love, Thou vanquished Victor, Crucified Supreme, That reign'st, because thou suffered'st! Thou hast now Done with those woes for ever: Thou hast left That glorious ?????????? to Thy band Battling in this world; Thou upon the vault Of “terrible crystal,” Ezekiel i. 22. which the Angels tread, Stand'st in the midst, the Lamb That hast been slain; And see'st the prostrate Elders, and the Four Mysterious Living Creatures, and the souls Perfect through suffering, that have reached Thy Land By the same path Thou trodd'st: and how they strike Their purest light-harps, and ascribe to Thee The glory and the wisdom and the might, The victory and salvation! Grant me, God, One day, the lowest place beneath their feet! RUTH. 1860. I. He stood on that prophetic height, The chief of Israel's host, And cast, inspired of God, his sight Round Canaan's furthest coast: Where Spring, like some fair youthful queen, Decked Jordan's banks with loveliest green, And, right in Judah's onward road, The City of the Palm-trees glowed, And Idumæa's mountains lay Far in the South, obscurely grey, To where the purple died away Upon the Western main: Where Ephraim's hills in glory shone, By sea-stormed Carmel, on and on, Till, crowned with snow-wreaths, Lebanon Girt in Sidonia's plain. Nor less he views each future scene, Though many a century intervene; How Judah's holier mount shall own The Lord's elected seat, And Sion's future towers enthrone The footstool of His feet: —Behold the land thy tribes must win, But plead thou not to enter in! II. Of all the vision, sweet yet faint, That cheered the warrior and the saint, What landscape could so brightly shine, Bethlehem-Ephratah, as thine? Dear sunny fields,—true “House of bread,”— True home of David's race; Whence Judah's mystic bands are fed And whence endued with grace; Where He His earliest light shall pour, The Flower of Jesse's rod; The Wonderful, the Counsellor, The Everlasting God: Where Israel's tribes shall lift the horn, And Satan's ranks be riven, What time to us a Child is born, To us a Son is given: Where midnight skies shall sing His birth, The future Lord of ransomed earth; Nor Gloria in Excelsis cease From furthest shore to shore To tell of “peace to men of peace,” From thenceforth evermore. III. O glorious theme! but all too high For my unskilful minstrelsy: I rather turn my ruder rhyme Back to the scenes of earlier time; Though still we mark the dews that gem Each leaf and flower of Bethlehem; Still note the evening's latest tint Upon her rustic turrets glint; Though many a sun has yet in turn To ripen Bethlehem's corn, And many a summer's course to burn, Before her Lord is born. Let others tell how here that Name, That Blessed Name, was won; And wreathe a garland for His fame, The everlasting Son: To no such strain I tune my string, No such renown I hail; I leave them all,—content to sing A simple village-tale. IV. A sky of the deepest and tenderest blue: A landscape that glistens with May's first dew: The land of the olive, the land of the vine, The region that floweth with oil and with wine: While the pathway, down to the valley, glows With Hermon's lily, and Sharon's rose: And, like peaceful squadrons in rank enrolled, The broad slopes glitter with barley-gold: What spot upon earth, as the spot where we stand, Is so like the happy eternal Land? But there is no riving of heart from heart: There none can sorrow, and none can part: There sickness is banished, and dried each tear, And consoled each mourner—'tis not so here! V. 'Tis not so here—for sad and slow, With words of doubt, and mien of woe, Three pilgrims onward stray; They mark not how, exulting loud, The lark, from yonder purple cloud, Salutes the early day: They reck not how the air is balm, How nature's very self breathes calm, And all her tribes are gay: No! there is hidden grief that lies Too deep for all her harmonies. Three pilgrims: one with matron air, And features worn, yet sadly fair, And beauty in its calm decay, As landscape in an autumn day: And two that to her neck have clung, Like roses round some firmer stem, O'er which their gentle leaves have hung, And which their red buds diadem. Both lovely as a dream—both dight In robes of eastern beauty's light: But she, whose darker ringlets deck The fair pure brow, and purer neck, Whose eye is clear and firm and true As summer heaven of deepest blue, Whose clinging gesture tells how much Affection speaks by very touch,— Go forth and search from East to West For tenderest eye and snowiest breast, For mingled loveliness and truth, And thou shalt find their home in Ruth! But who that sees them now, would dare To think that Orpah were less fair? Less fixed in faith, less firm in hope, With every toil, for love, to cope? VI. Two summer morns alike may break, And bid the wood's sweet anthems wake; And one shall mark its sun descend Unclouded, to his glorious end, And one shall see the whirlwind rise, And storm and gloom enshroud its skies. Two summer larks alike may spring, At daybreak, on their upward wing; And this at eve shall carol loud Beneath her canopy of cloud, And that, before the west is grey, Shall flutter as the fowler's prey. Two rosebuds shall alike be seen To burst their shrine of emerald green; And one shall shed its life-long breath In sweetness, and be sweet in death; And one, ere yet 'tis fully burst, With mildew and with blight be curst. And so these twain:—this hour shall view Which is the feigned and which the true. VII. With her fair sad face, and her matron grace, She spake to her daughters twain; And her glance was cast to the days that were past, And could never return again: To the loved ones that lie 'neath an alien sky, And moulder in heathen clay; And never shall stand in the Lord's own land Till the Resurrection Day. VIII. “O happy hours, while yet of old The God of Jacob watched His fold, While yours, mine own, it was to bless With love and careful tenderness: And though remembering, day by day, The Lord's own mansion, far away, And mindful, at each evening's rise, Of Shiloh's holy Sacrifice,— Still had I hoped one day to tread, With you and with the holy dead, To you unknown, but dear to them, The quiet fields of Bethlehem. That hope is past: and though my heart Half breaks to say it, we must part: 'Tis the Most High that wills it—No! Cling not to me, sweet daughters, so! I have no sons, my joy and pride, Henceforth to claim in each their bride; I have no hope, in sinking age To find a home for heritage. Turn, then, and seek your native shore; Turn to your people's shrine once more: And, wheresoe'er your lot be thrown, The God we trust in guard His own! And give you some one day to prove His best and holiest treasure, love; And infants that shall yet be pressed With mother's rapture to the breast: And so His aid be by you felt, His shield around you spread, As, in the former days, ye dealt With me, and with the dead!” IX. O Orpah, dost thou hide thy face, And canst thou bear to sever? And hast thou heart for that embrace Which says farewell for ever? —Thou, in Whose Hand is earthly bliss, Oh give me any woe but this! That where I lean with every power Of faith and love and trust, I ever should endure the hour That crushes all to dust! Take those I love, if so Thy will, And I may love them dearlier still: They pass but for a while away, They dwell at home with Thee;— And I shall go to them, tho' they Shall not return to me: But thus to lose the faith of years,— 'Tis grief that lies too deep for tears: 'Tis gloom, whence hope no ray can borrow: 'Tis night that cannot look for morrow. Once more I pray:—an Orpah's kiss,— O give me any woe but this! X. What time the storm was black as night, And rain was driving fast, And gulfs of cloud, from height to height, Were tossed before the blast: Hast thou not seen the rainbow-arch From North to South serenely march, And heard its own consoling cheer, ‘Be of good comfort! God is here!’ So as they stood beside the palm Where Orpah bade farewell, Those accents full of love and calm Upon the silence fell: “Whate'er of weal, whate'er of woe, Beset thy future way, Whither thou goest, I will go, And where thou stayest, stay: Where'er thou shalt have bowed the knee, Whatever path have trod, Thy people shall my people be, Thy God shall be my God: And when that darkest hour draws nigh, Yet be not thou afraid: For where thou diest, I will die, And there will I be laid: And God do so and more to me, If aught but death part me and thee!” XI. Three thousand years have passed away Since first those words were spoken, And still, as on that very day, Their spell remains unbroken: The exile on an alien shore Drinks in their high devotion, The home-wrapped seaman cons them o'er Upon the Atlantic Ocean: The soldier grasps them for his shield Before the sign of battle; They whisper comfort in the field Above the cannon's rattle: Watchword of woman's love, that still Will mock at space, and smile at ill: That, when the clouds close darkest round, Will only shine the brighter; That, when the rest are faithless found, Will only cling the tighter: ‘The Lord do so and more to me, If aught but death part me and thee!’ XII. See Psalm lxv. Thou art praised in Sion, O God of Hosts! And to Thee they perform the vow, When they go to worship in Salem's coasts, And before Thine Altar bow: Thou visitest earth with a glorious birth; Thou makest it plenteous indeed; And the River of God shall fatten the sod, For so Thou preparest the seed: Thou waterest her furrows, Thou droppest the grain Into every little vale; And Thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, Nor lettest the increase fail: Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness here, And Thy clouds drop fatness still: They shall comfort and bless the wilderness, And gladden each little hill: —The folds shall be full of sheep! The valleys so thick with corn, That for very joy they shall laugh and leap, When Thou liftest Thy people's horn! XIII. So from the break of early day, Until the night grew dim, In Ephratah, while all was gay, Went on the harvest hymn: But thou in harvest joy to share, Poor wanderer! hast but little care! —She hastened forth from Bethlehem With all a Mother's pride, Content the world's wild waves to stem, Her husband at her side: Now she returns in life's decay, Youth's brightest dreams dissolved away: Her footsteps, like an alien's, roam Round that which once she called her home: And, but for this dear treasure, now Hers by affection and by vow, As lonely midst her own she stands, As shipwrecked man on stranger sands. ‘O call me not Naomi,—God Hath changed my former name! And for the Crown He sends the rod, And for the glory, shame: Yet to His Will content to bow,— My title must be Mara now!’ XIV. I marvel not that poets teach Of that fair golden time, When heart was pure, when thought was speech, When heart was in her prime. And so I deem, as I behold Where Bethlehem's harvest waves in gold, And see the lord of all the land Come forth amidst his reaper band, With gentle mien and kindly air, As if an equal part they bare, —The master in the servants' toil, The servants in the master's spoil. “The Lord be with thee!”—O sweet token Of love to God and man unbroken! O glorious words, which not alone Shall Bethlehem's hills repeat, But after years, from zone to zone, Shall echo at the Lord's own Throne In many a cadence sweet: What time the vast Cathedral pile, From vaulted Nave and fretted Aisle, Shall, all in answer meet, “And with thy spirit!” make reply, In that full choral harmony! XV. But one there is, of stranger mien, Who dares in those sweet fields to glean, Where none may grudge, and none upbraids, Amidst the ranks of Israel's maids; Although the fierce sun, flaming down, Hath tinged her cheek with darker brown, Although with unaccustomed toil She gather in the reaper's spoil, Deem not her task unblessed above— She toils in faith, and works for love. “Hearken, my daughter! Seek not now In other fields to stray, But by my maidens tarry thou, And in my harvest stay: And at their fountain cool thy lip, And in their cup thy morsel dip: Have I not charged them, that they be As though they shared one home with thee?” XVI. —Oh, in this world, that turns its sight To darkness rather than to light, And, in its course embruted, That loves to brand the pure and bright As faithless and polluted; The very worst suspecting still, And out of good inventing ill; In this poor judgment-seat of dust, How great a thing is holy trust! —The merry harvest feast is past; The harvest pipe is hushed at last; In scattered farm and distant cot Of many a wild and hill-side spot, The reapers, while in silence dim The moon her bright watch keepeth, Once more commend themselves to Him, Who slumbereth not nor sleepeth. But Boaz,—he must be secure Whose willing hand hath fed the poor,— But Boaz lays him down to rest, Where are the barn sheaves closeliest prest. When the Lord's banner is unfurled, And crushed are death and sin, Thus, in the harvest of the world, He shall be garnered in! XVII. Oh blame her not! she comes impressed By Israel's law in clear behest: Directed by the lore of age To claim her wifely heritage: As pure as Angels in the sky, As safe as in a sanctuary. The heaven is calm, the night is dark: That barn-floor is her holy ark: He sleeps the good man's slumber sweet; She crouches stilly at his feet: And guardian Angels watch above, With looks of joy and thoughts of love: They see, in prophet-vision clear, The future scenes that shall be there: The Babe that comes our woes to heal, And make our bitter sweet: The Virgin Mother that shall kneel And worship at His Feet: Though Israel may reject her Lord, The ox and ass shall know The Prince, for evermore adored, Who comes to dwell below: And hither shall the wise men bring Their offerings three, to own The God, the Mortal, and the King, Who reigns from Sion's throne! When shall the promised time appear, That this shall be, and this be here? That promised time and King they see, And trace His line, sweet Ruth, to thee! XVIII. Why should I tell how midnight rest With holy, plighted troth was blest? Why should I tell, at Bethlehem's gate How Bethlehem's chosen elders wait, And call the God Who rules the sky The sacred bond to ratify? How she, the alien one, who chose In Israel's land to find repose, Her home, her kin, her gods forsaken, From Israel's God hath guerdon taken? And therefore is her name enrolled In that celestial page, Which, writ in characters of gold, Shall live from age to age: And therefore doth her story shine, Unspotted, in Messiah's line; And she hath won the endless fame That from her heathen-root He came. And so, amidst a world of strife, She speaks the words of hope and life: ‘If thou art called to toil for truth, Yet be not thou afraid; But think upon the God of Ruth, And He shall give thee aid!’ KING JOSIAH. 1862. Who, with apparel stained of crimson hue, —Like one that treads the winefat, or as chief Returning victor from the field of blood— Comes softly thro' the woodland?—Who but He, The God of Autumn, guarding plighted troth, Troth, then first plighted when He stretched the bow From Ararat to Elbrouz, “while earth lasts, Seedtime and harvest, day and night, shall be”?— He speaks the word: and leafy chapels, late Rich with the music of a thousand songs, Green shrines, where nightingales from eve till morn Poured antiphonal joy, and loftier Aisles, Sweet with the wild doves' gurgling note of love, Assume the sunset of the year. The elm Dissolves in golden showers: the maple sends A flock of red leaves, like the rainbow-birds Of tropic forests, wandering through the air; And the brave oak tears off his purpler vest. “God made not death:” and autumn had no rule In His first Paradise, nor shall have place In that, the better Paradise, which One, On the dim evening of a stormy day, With dying lips foretold to dying ears, Saying, “To-day shalt thou be with Me there.” Yes: Autumn is of Earth: and Earth hath too An Autumn of the nations. Then the sap Which, in its young wild life, joined land to land, Turned forests into cities, made the sea White with a thousand sails, sent lion-hearts To found new empires, making glad the waste With woman's love and beauty, children's smiles, And man's brave honest toil, and all that bids The sad and solitary land rejoice, Dies at its very fountain. Then strong arms Falter and tremble: then strong hearts grow faint:— And efforts dwarf and dwindle, and the night Cometh when none can work. So nations' years Draw to the mournful autumn of their close; And such an autumn knows no second spring. So Israel's autumn now; as shortening days, And rising winds, and gathering clouds, proclaim. Yet, as in Western forests, ere the snow Wraps the whole earth in Winter's bridal veil, Ere nature's pulses cease, ere yet the wolf Wakes the gaunt echoes of the leafless trees, The Indian knows of gentler gales,—of flowers Decked in half-vernal beauty,—knows of skies Cloudless, or flecked with soft-winged specks, that drop Their playful shadows where the warm wind breathes, —And all the more presages that the end, The dead year's winding-sheet, is therefore nigh: Or, as when hectic's deadly rose hath burnt Some maiden cheek,—and kindled up the eye To deeper beauty, while each waning day Gives troth more earnest to the last great Foe; And they, the hopeless watchers, know her lot No other bridal chamber than the grave: Perchance, in that last conflict, nature wakes Her utmost efforts, and, a moment, Life Winning her last, last field, keeps Death at bay: Yet not the less, poor Mother, dost thou see The glazing eye, damp brow, and all that makes The laying down the flesh so hard, at hand:— So Israel trod the last steep steps of death. A helpless, hopeless struggle thine, O King, Last very King of Judah! Yet not less I deem that chief's a glorious part, who now, Outnumbered, outmanœuvred, sure of fate, While arm can strike, or heart can beat, fights on. Nor less the pilot's, who, when utmost skill Hath done its part, and done its part in vain, With mainmast by the board, and bulwarks gone, And boats swept off, while right ahead, the deep Churns, on the jaws of some near reef, its foam, Stands by the helm, and faithful to the last, Rules the devoted vessel. Them, if not The meed of man, the Crown of God, awaits. Wherefore let God's great temple, that dear House Of Israel's praises, raise its head once more! Once more with trumpet peal, and gentler lute, And dulcimer and psaltery, pour the strain Over the thousand victims! Let the Priests, The sons of Aaron, in their courses wait: And choose ye out the Lamb, and strike the blood On lintel and on doorpost, while the tale Of Israel's great salvation passes round: And eat with girded loins, and staff in hand, And bitter herbs: while orphan lips It is well known that a portion of the Passover Service, according to the Jewish tradition, was necessarily said by an orphan; to which our Lord's words, “I will not leave you orphans,” spoken on that same Passover night, have probably reference. rehearse The glories of that Red Sea march, and tell Of horse and rider thrown into the sea: And let the great shout rise—“For He is good, His Mercy is for ever,”—echoed back From Sion to Mount Olivet, and o'er The Hill of Evil Counsel. There are ears Now drinking in this jubilance of praise, That, pass how short a space! shall hear the roar Of flame-cones shooting high above those towers; The wild Chaldean yell,—the groan of death, The sob of mortal anguish, and the shriek Of maiden's last despair. And eyes which now Behold the goodly cohort, that arrayed In linen vest and ephod, as one man, Pour from a thousand trumpets God's great praise,— Those eyes shall see the marble halls enwrapped In smoke and fire, while streams of molten gold Run down the glorious pavement, and the air In far-off vales and palmgroves breathes the scent Of cedar roofs consuming. But not yet: While Judah's monarch lives, her life is charmed: So spake, by woman's voice, the Lord of Hosts: “Thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, And shalt not see the evil.” So the Feast Was Queen of all past Festals:—and the King, If hopeless of his country's future, still Goes forth to wreak God's vengeance on the shrines That thus have wrought her ruin. Aye, strike on! Still in thine ear those curses ring,—still glare Those letters in thine eyes: “If thou shalt turn To such foul gods of wood and stone, the fear Of those devoted nations, then accursed In city art thou, and in field accursed: Accursed in going out and coming in: Accursed in basket and in store: Accursed In fruit of body, and in fruit of land; In increase of thy kine and of thy sheep: Then shall the plague, the thing Vulg. Psalm xc. 6. A negotio perambulante in tenebris. that walks by night, Stalk through thy dwelling: then consumption seize The flower of all thine offspring: then the Lord Shall smite thee with the mildew and the blight, The blasting, and the burning, and the scab: Then shall the heaven above thee turn to brass, The earth beneath be iron. Thou shalt grope At noonday in the darkness that is felt: Thou shalt betroth a bride in all her youth And all her beauty; and her beauty' and youth Others shall rifle. So shalt thou become A byeword and a hissing and a curse: One way shalt thou go forth against thy foes; Ten ways shalt flee before them.” So he stands Amid that cypress grove, where autumn suns Diffuse a mournful splendour: where they lie Who passed away—I say not, fell asleep— In worship of the hate of Israel's God. —Thou seest yon forest where the great oaks cast Their broken and fantastic shades athwart The greensward glades, where, but for them, the sun Had ploughed his golden furrows on the lea?— Yes; they have seen, since that great day of wrath, Four centuries of foliage. Then he came, The Prophet of the Living God,—he told God's vengeance on the Altar and the King. Oh wise for others! madman for himself! He ventured on the Martyr's path: he saw The Monarch's hand outstretched: he saw it struck And palsied in the very act of sin: Then rose his prayer like incense to the skies, And so the sin was pardoned. Yet not less Himself was faithless,—yet not less himself Obeyed an alien teacher. So he left A monument to other years of sin So hardly punished, that, in future days, God's Prophet may obey the Lord he tells: God's Seer may be God's Saint. Now 'midst the tombs Under the cypress trees,—those mossy stones Grey with the lichens of four hundred years, He rests, rests well at last. “Let him alone: Let no man move his bones.” The heavy guilt Hath heavily been punished: he shall now Stand forth the safeguard of the treacherous friend, And lured by him to death, preserve in death. Nor doubt that, by a short rough path, he went To happier fields: “no lion shall be there; Nor any evil beast go up thereon.” And will not all avail? The tears, the prayers, The rendering back its beauty to God's shrine, The casting down of idols? Shall not this Plead for the guilt of many a year of sin?— No more than all the tears of autumn-dew Can call back spring's poor flowers: no more than gales Rich with September-fragrance, can awake May's fresh green foliage on the forest bough. “There is a sin to death:” there is a time When God shuts up the future: leaving there A certain looking for of fiery wrath. Woe, woe for him that hangs about the gate, Which entered, hope departs! And yet despite Of warning and of mercy, spite of all That his good Angel, in mysterious way, Whispers in those dim chambers of the heart, In spite of utmost danger, man sins on. Thou, glorious King of Judah, thou shalt save Thyself before the ruin: thou shalt find Before the ship goes down, a blessed port: But Israel's doom was fixed, what time she shed The blood of all those Martyr-seers, what time There stood an idol in the house of God: 2 Kings, xxi. 7. Some stoned, some sawn asunder, some with sword Sent to their glory: they of whom the world Was not found worthy: they who wandered, clad In sheepskins and in goatskins, far and wide, Tormented and afflict and destitute: And chiefly him, the eagle-seer, who soared So far above things earthly—who proclaimed “A Virgin shall conceive and bear the Son;” The Monarch That should reign, but reign by death, Should be rejected and despised of men, Afflicted, and deserted, and contemned: Who saw the goodly Land, to which That King Should call His followers, in His time, to share The many mansions of His Father's House. “The sun shall be no more thy light by day, Neither for brightness shall the moon,” he cried; “The Lord shall be Thine everlasting light, And all thy mourning days have found their end.” That blood calls still, calls bitterly: the years Of idol-worship, join their cry to that. Look backward to the glory of that day, When gold and gems, and utmost heart conjoined Built up that glorious temple. Step by step, Conquest on conquest, loss by loss, it fell. Oh manifold oblations—threefold feasts That drew all Israel, whether Paschal Lamb Called them—or when they kept the Festal “Weeks,” Or sojourned under tents! These all must cease; Must cease—and they shall sit by other streams, And sing the Lord's song in an alien land. May they not plead on high?—those glorious Kings, True both in act and suffering,—from the day When Zephathah saw Ethiopian hosts In numbers numberless, o'erwhelmed;—and when, Far in the wilderness, the rising sun Turned into crimson every newborn spring;— And when the Assyrian host, arrayed about The battlements of Sion, vaunted high “Where is the King of Eden? where the King Of Hena and of Ivah? Have their gods Delivered Judah's people from my hands?” And when,—oh wonder not on earth alone, But reaching to the Heavens! the sun went back, And every planet heard His voice, Who rules Arcturus and the Pleiades, and girds Peerless Orion with his golden belt: And ten degrees were added to the world, And all its cares and joys and woes;—and when The Angel of the Lord went out by night, A gloomy night, when mist enwrapped the earth As with its funeral pall, and midst the tents That girded Salem, sent, in one same hour, One hundred fourscore thousand to their doom: —May not these Saints now plead on high? Themselves They have delivered: they have gained the seat On the right hand of mercy: they shall quaff The river of His pleasures evermore: But none can save his brother; none can make Agreement unto God for him: it cost More to redeem their souls: and he must needs Let that alone for ever. Who is this That, entering from the Northern Gate, rides on Adown the hill of David? This is he, Envoy of Israel's ancient foe,—to claim Freedom of passage over Israel's realm. O hapless people, own the voice of God! Hear it, O Son of David! Now the ship Is driven into the “place where two seas meet:” On this side and on that the high, high waves Would dash thy little bark to pieces. Now Own thou the word of God, albeit proclaimed From lips unused to speak it. He, who once Said, “Israel's God I know not, nor will let The tribes of Israel's God go free,”—he now, (In generations long adown the line, The golden line of thousand years,) demands Like passage here God's children asked for there. Woe! when amidst the darkness of the mine, Long toiled for, hoped for long, the glorious gem Gladdens the heart, and flashes on the eyes Of them whose strong right arms with eager toil Have delved to gain it—if perchance that gem Priceless, except one flaw, by that one flaw, Weighed in the scales, is robbed of half its worth Thou think'st, O King of Judah! that to thee And thee alone, God speaks; but know thou this: God by an alien voice can teach His law True, as by holiest prophets. Thou wouldst keep His land by alien footsteps undefiled. But what if this thy trial? what if this The lesson that thou, learning, might'st redeem So many a lesson by thy tribes unlearned? Oh if thou wouldst but hear him! Oh if now, Thou, even thou, at least in this thy day, Wouldst listen to the things that touch thy peace! —It may not be; the sentence had gone forth: The sentence then enrolled, what time the cry Went up from earth to heaven, of all the blood, The martyr-blood, of them that died for Him, “Which the Lord would not pardon.” 2 Kings xxiv. 4. Go then forth, Go, King of Judah, battle with thy God! Thou, who so long hast fought the glorious fight, Run the true race so long, and kept the faith,— And must thou turn astray at last? He speaks— Hear it, or hear it not,—from God's Own Mouth. O fearful balance! Israel's scales are poised; Their sins on this side, God's dear love on that: And tekel is the verdict. Therefore now, God's Own elected Jewel, to the fight! Thou shalt be His when He makes up His own, Safe in the golden shrine wherein the true And brave ones are His own predestinate: But dream thou not of earthly victories won; Of Alleluias which shall echo back From every hill round Salem. Thou hast once Offered the holiest Passover of all; Now shalt thou be the victim. Forth he went In his own strength, O Sion, to the fight: Now he returns in other guise: the hand That held so late the royal sceptre, touched And withered by the grave. Now God's Own House Hath seen its latest glories. Triumph now, O Judah's earliest, Judah's latest Foe! This is the last of reckonings up: this hour Takes the long line of Judah's ancient kings, Weighs in the balances, and finds them fail. Woe, woe for these! Joy, joy for him! For them That struggle still amidst the storm, that yet Strive hard amidst the battle, almost whelmed Amidst the peril of its eddies, woe! Woe to the men that shall behold the house,— “The beautiful and holy house,” enwrapped In Babylonian fire! But joy to him, So early called to fight, so soon to peace! Who would not gladly gird his armour on, If, wearing it a moment, he might hang That armour forthwith in the hall of Rest? The fight he fought, the toils he bore, are ours; Like his, our idols also; hand to hand With them our warfare; only now no more The battle-field is visible: 'tis deep In the recesses of the inmost heart; “The good I would I do not”—there the strife— “The evil that I would not that I do.” And Judah's Monarch won the truer crown; But won it by his death. And how shall we, God's own elected Israel, triumph now, Till when, in that last battle with the Foe, Egypt then crushed for ever, we shall fall? THE SEVEN CHURCHES OF ASIA. 1863. Aye, let them wreak the deadliest of their hate Upon the Lord's Elected! Let them speed, Far as the Empire spreads her giant arms, The bolt of persecution; gird their loins For battle with the Lord and with his Christ; And test the strength of agony by hope, Of faith by torture; setting present shame Against the exceeding and eternal Crown: And learn how Love counts this her deepest joy, To match herself with Death; joy doubly dear When Death comes armed in doubly hideous form. —I see them pass—O bright palmiferous band That none can number!—all arrayed as fits The King's triumphant warriors, who came out Of mighty tribulation, but are now Clad in the white robes of eternal peace: —I see them pass, the Crown upon their head, To join the everlasting marriage-feast: Old men, who only grieved that life in them Was but so poor a thing to fling away: Soldiers, once vowed to Cæsar's Throne, now bound By Military Sacrament to One Greater than Cæsar: maidens that till then Had known no ruder visiting of touch Than mother's gentle arm, or sister's kiss; But, in an ecstasy of joy, shall now Find, in the rack's long terrible embrace, Their truer bridal. These are they that stood Firm in the Colosseum, when the cry “The Christians to the Lions!” rose to Heaven: That gave their bodies to the flame, but not Their souls to idols: mothers that endured To see their little ones' most tender life Ebbing away beneath the scourge, and shed No tear, but rather urged them to the fight. Well borne the darkness and the tempest!—He, His People's Leader, in His own dear Voice To every soul that agonised for Him Shall speak of Winter over, raindrops passed, And the sweet Turtle's song of endless peace. ‘Arise, My love, My fair one! come away!’ An Easter morn on Patmos! All around The bluely-trembling sea smiles countlessly; While splintery peak and crag go towering up, Height above height, where soft and tender clouds Nestle, as Beauty clings to Valour's breast. —But what to him, most loving and most loved Of all the King's Apostles, is the light That flickers on the heaving wave—the sail That like a snowy sea-bird flashes out, Then tacks again to darkness? There he stands Upon the wild sea-shore, and sends his thoughts Back to the Day of days, when first they came Breathless with haste and ecstasied with joy: ‘The Lord is risen indeed!’ And so it dawned, The glorious spring-day of a ransomed earth. He sees the Garden by the Sacred Rock, He breathes its very incense; even now Its Palms make music to him; he beholds The Napkin that had touched the Glorious Head Folded apart: the Grave clothes, (useless now, Since Death by death is swallowed up of Life,) Laid by themselves:—he listens to the bray Of trumpet and of cymbal, that floats on From Sion's hill, where Priest and people keep The Paschal Feast, not knowing that the Lamb, The great Oblation of the earth, is slain, Slain by their hands but three short days agone: And still he stands and muses. Oh how near We tread the confines of the spirit-world! How thin the veil that hides it! Who but feels Sometime, in night's dim silence and dead noon, Conscious that those we deem so far are near, The lost are present? Who that has not heard Of strange mysterious warnings, or perchance The work of Guardian Angel, or belike Of friend who, having loved us, loves us still, And who, now free, would guard us, captives yet? —Who has not felt, in hour of need or woe, Illapses more than earthly?—This be sure: That when we solve—God grant we solve it well!— That last and greatest riddle, when our eyes Begin to open on the spirit-land, Then we shall learn how mixed and intertwined Thro' all our course, has been that land with this. —Who that has then stood ministering, and watched The strange on-coming of that fearful Thing Whose viewless presence fills the room, and makes Him that had never seen its advent yet, Say, as by some new instinct,—This is Death!— Who that has, awe-struck, marked the dying eye Follow through vacancy some form no sight Of living man could reach, but feels—‘He now Is on the very point of making out The terrible enigma,—he is now Half in the world where flesh and blood come not.’ —Earth and earth's scenes have vanished! Boundless sea And royal coronet of clouds, that hang Above the eternal mountain,—where are they? And Who is here? He here, the First and Last; The Alpha and Omega; the Amen; The Faithful and True Witness. Not as erst He stood in that tremendous hour of shame, (O loving hour for man!) or when He trod The Via Dolorosa, summing up The bitterness of all that suffering Life In the most conquering Passion of His Death. —Intense in brightness stands He: in His hand The Sevenfold coronet of stars; the Lamp, The Sevenfold golden Lamp is by His side: He comes to walk amidst His sevenfold Church, And speak her Angels' sentence: so to speak That Mercy yet give season to amend; To strengthen what is wanting; to confirm That which as yet is stable. Not as then, When in the darkness and the cloud, amidst Adoring bands of Angels, He shall sit, The final Arbiter of human things; And the Archangel's trumpet voice proclaim That time shall be no longer. Then no place For late repentance: no oblation then Of prayers, or tears, or almsdeeds shall avail: When all the kindreds of the earth shall mourn, And the Elect lift up with joy their heads. —But not as yet that Advent: now He comes With mercy tempering justice: comes to cheer His champions to the fight; with loving words To warn the self-deceivers; to inspire Fresh courage in the faint, and bid the strong Press bravelier onward to the heavenly crown. Stand forth, and hear the sentence of Thy Lord, City of Temples, Asia's Primate Church! ‘I know thy works, thy patience, and thy faith: Thy hatred to the evil: thou hast borne, And for My Name's sake laboured, fainting not. But this I have against thee; thou hast left Thy earliest love, the kindness of thy youth, The love of thine espousal-tide. Jeremiah ii. 2. Repent: Or know, thy candlestick shall be removed, And darkness settle round and gird thee in.’ Ah me! I look adown the line of years, But that first love returns not! Still she stands Firm to the truth, and faithful to her Lord: Proclaims, as with a voice of thunder, Reference is made to the Council of Ephesus: the Third Œcumenical, in which the Nestorian heresy was finally condemned. how He, of a truth, Incarnate for our sake, Is consubstantial with Humanity: But grievous wolves and ravening enter in: Acts xx. 29. And Grace decays, and Love grows weak, until The accursed Crescent towers above the Cross; And all her Martyrs' blood, and all the toil And faith of her Confessors, end in this;— The Angel of the Church long leagues away, Priests fled, and Altars overthrown, and scarce Two mouldering huts that name the Name of Christ! O what a sevenfold flood of glory pours In the following lines, the seven blessings “To him that overcometh” are taken in the connection which the best Commentators, and more especially, of late, the Dean of Westminster, have seen in them. In each succeeding promise, brightening still And kindling in intenseness to the close, “To him that overcometh!” He shall eat, Eat of the Tree of Life; not that which erst Bloomed in the earthly Paradise, whereof Man ate not through God's love; lest, if he ate, He in this mortal world should live for aye: But that abiding, that enduring Life, Life of the Blessed, Life of God Himself; Life whence the Fountain of all good things springs, The Beatific Vision!—Into that, The lost and lovely Eden, Death came in: But now no fear of death deflowers their joy, No pining malady, no bloodless age; Yea, “he that overcometh shall not be Hurt of the second Death.” He treads not now The waste and howling wilderness of earth; As erst they trod, around whose tent, each morn, Angelic food descended with the dew: Yet hath he heavenly Manna, while he sits At that high Banquet, where the Victors rest; And tell how, 'neath their Chief's protecting Arm, They went from strength to strength. For war is o'er: The iron sceptre in the Lord's Right Hand Hath dashed the Foe in pieces; with the Chief The followers conquer; their long trial past, Their carnal battles over.—Is there yet A higher bliss for them that overcome? “Him will I make a pillar in God's shrine: He shall no more go out.” O Joy of joys! O blest necessity of sinlessness! Reference is made to the Beata necessitas non peccandi of the Schoolmen. And ask ye more than this? Then hear the close. “To him that overcometh will I give To sit with Me upon My Throne, as I, The Agony endured, the Crown put on, Sat down upon the Eternal Father's Throne.” —O glorious Rainbow, decked with sevenfold hues! O perfect Octave of Eternal Bliss! What sweetest strain of music floats adown The eternal mountain? Passing sweet, as though 'Twere some faint echo of the notes they hymn, The “harpers harping, with their harps,” who bow Before the golden Throne: yet passing sad, As though a heart-wreck centred in each note? —I know thy poverty (but thou art rich) Thou Church whose name is Myrrh! Smyrna the same as Myrrha; see Dean Trench.—The incense needs Must feel the fire, or ere its sweetness lifts Her trailing cloud of beauty through the air: The violet trodden under foot gives out A more than double fragrance: and the string Racked to the full sends forth its sweetest sound. —Well to that glorious Angel S. Polycarp. rings that note, Keynote of persecution! “In the world Ye shall have tribulation.” O how fierce The assault of Satan on that spotless Church! ‘Be faithful to the death, and I will give The Crown of Life!’—And lo! I view the scene, Where he, who bare in very deed much fruit, Stands forth, the athlete in the glorious strife; Stands forth, the whilst they raise the pile; and marks, Serene, the wood reared up, the fire prepared, And knows himself the Victim. And he speaks: “Fourscore and six years have I served this Lord, And found a loving Master;—shall I now Deny His Service?”—And himself the while, Amidst the flame, as gold refined, is tried: And tried, is proved: and proved, receives the Crown. O twin and loving Sisters! faultless both, Judged by those searching eyes! And Smyrna still, And Philadelphia, clinging to the faith, Inherit that same promise: they are kept Because they kept the word of patience, firm Amidst encircling weakness: pillars they Amongst surrounding ruin.—O pledged word Of God's Eternal Truth! Nor deem thou these Sole witnesses of faith from age to age; But rather think how each succeeding day, Since the first hour He tabernacled here, Hath blazoned forth His Truth, hath taught the weak To lean on Him the Mighty; dropped in Balm Assuaging myriad wounds: but only thus: As those elected Five amid the Seven, It is to be noticed that only Sardis and Laodicea, of all the Seven Churches, have no internal heresy nor outward attack against which they are warned. By struggle or with self or with the Foe. And thou, too, dweller hard by Satan's throne, Thou hast thine offering ready:—not as those, When in the marble court the Priests stood ranged, With trumpet and with clarion: and the flame Leapt high and flickering,—and the assembled tribes Fell down and worshipped: other gift is thine: One dear oblation, but that one worth all The Synagogue could offer: one that stood Single, against a multitude of foes, Valiant, amidst fierce taunts of coward ranks, Constant, amidst a host of unbelief. O Faithful and True Witness! he was then Witness for Thee, and champion of Thy rights: Therefore his lot is with the sons of God, His Portion with the Saints.—Nor he thy one And only boast, O Pergamum! That day, When kingly Rhone shall see his banks girt in With struggling crowds, and all along the shore The Lictors, and the Eagle, and the Priests, And legionary soldiers follow on In long procession, and the curule chair Receives the fierce Proconsul; there they stand, Those Martyrs of Lugdunum, spurning back The offered incense: slave they stand, and Priest, Bishop and soldier, ready for the war, And strong in Christ's own strength: while devilish art Searches each sense and avenue of life; And scourge and rack and pincer join with flame To torture nerve and sinew;—them amidst A Pergamene shall hold no hindmost place. ‘Call us not,’ say they, ‘Martyrs: there is One, And One alone True Martyr: we are His —Not Martyrs, but poor servants,—rendering back The life He gave us first and then redeemed.’ Wake, Thyatira, rouse thee! Take in hand The Spirit's sword and smite the accursed sect; Them who deny that in this very flesh The Lord was born and died: and thence deny That flesh thus made God's temple, needs must now Be, as His Spirit, holy. This their boast; To know “the depths of Satan:” to give up The body to each vile dishonouring lust; The while the soul, in some serener height, Sits unpolluted, mistress of her peace, And combats pleasure's self with pleasure's arms. ‘This is the glorious triumph,’—such their lore,— ‘Not by hard toil to keep that body down ‘Like some chained prisoner; not to wage the war ‘Immortal against mortal: but to plunge ‘Headlong in fleshly riot, and, by that, ‘Mock Satan's power in Satan's own domain.’ The foregoing lines refer to the Gnostic heresy: which, denying the Incarnation, denied also the necessity of the purity of the body. Up, Thyatira! though thy works are more, —The latter than the former,—persevere; That which thou hast already, hold thou fast, Until he come, Whose Coming is thy goal! Let Sardis stand for judgment; by her side The city of the murderess queen, whose heights Look down upon the Lycus. Laodicea, at first Diospolis; then Thoas: at last so-called from Laodice, the wife of Antiochus the II., whom she afterwards murdered. They alone No foemen have within, no fear without, No fire of persecution, no assault Of ravening heresy. A still deep calm: Nor dread of ill occurrent. Thus He speaks, That holds the Seven Spirits, and seven stars: Angel of Sardis, hear!—‘I know thy works: Thou hast the name of living, and art dead.’ —The fair wind blows; the vessel is in port: O'er incense-breathing Tmolus, through the vale Whence, white with swans, Caÿster seeks the sea, The Apostolic missive passes on:— Forthwith through Sardis spreads the high report, The Lord That died and rose and lives for aye, Hath spoken to His faithful here.—At once They crowd His House; expectant that His praise Will crown that fame the Churches deem their due. —O woeful, fearful wakening now! “Thou hast A name that thou art living, but art dead: Thy works have I found wanting.” And they think Of that tremendous night, when, midst the glare Of myriad lamps, the melody of lute, Of psaltery and of sackbut, while from gold They quaffed the golden juice of priceless vines, While glorious roofs were echoing back the laugh, And storied walls the music; while each charm That Beauty, reft of Beauty's one true pearl, Could weave round that infatuate monarch,—still Madlier the revel, foullier went the jest; Then in that selfsame hour the ghastly hand, The spirit-hand, that joined no earthly shape, Gleamed out so cold upon the wall, above The glare of lamps and torch: and traced so plain, In characters that iced their blood who saw, (Deep horror grew more deep, dead heart more dead) The fatal tekel.—This, O King, thy fate: Weighed in the balances, and wanting! Thus Came fearful awe on Sardis. ‘Yet look up, O remnant that are left! Thou hast a few That have not stained their garments; they shall walk With Me in white.—And wilt thou hear His Voice? —Let the long lines of future years respond. —When stood'st thou forward in the battle? When Sent'st thou thy sons to agonise for Him Thy Lord and Leader?—Oh, the utter wreck Of those two mouldering shafts that bear thy name! And thou, companion in her guilt and shame, And Sister in her sentence,—‘I,’ thou sayest, ‘Am rich and multiplied with goods, and stand ‘In need of nought!’ Ah me! in need of all, Since needing Him That should be all in all. Wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, And settling on thy lees: nor cold nor hot. I counsel thee to buy the gold that comes Bright from affliction's furnace: raiment white In that most dearest stream of Calvary's Mount. Apocalyptic Vision! of whose shrine This is the Sevenfold Portal! stretching out From strength to strength, from hope to hope, until Thou reachest to the pinnacle of bliss: Thy manifold afflictions end in joy; Thy manifold attacks in endless peace. —And is that peace, and is that joy, for me?— THE END</field>
