      <field name="fulltext">SMALLER POEMS, &amp;c. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?? ????? ??????? ??????????. (Tweddell, Prolus. viii.) Tempore quo primùm vestis mihi tradita pura est, Jucundum cùm ætas florida ver ageret, Multa satis lusi: non est Dea nescia nostrî, Quæ dulcem curis miscet amaritiem. (Catull. Ixvi. 15.) [Father of All!] Father of All! in every age, In every clime adored; By saint, by savage, and by sage; Jehovah, Jove, or Lord! Thou Great First Cause, least understood! Who all my sense confined To know but this, that Thou art good, And that myself am blind: Yet gave me, in this dark estate, To know the good from ill; And binding nature fast in fate, Left free the human will. What conscience dictates to be done, Or warns me not to do; This teach me more than hell to shun, That more than heaven pursue. What blessings thy free bounty gives, Let me not cast away; For God is paid, when man receives: T' enjoy is to obey. Yet not to earth's contracted span Thy goodness let me bound: Or think Thee Lord alone of man, When thousand worlds are round. Let not this weak unknowing hand Presume thy bolts to throw; And deal damnation 'round the land, On each I judge thy foe. If I am right, thy grace impart Still in the right to stay: If I am wrong, O teach my heart To find that better way. Save me alike from foolish pride, Or impious discontent At aught thy wisdom has denied, Or aught thy goodness lent. Teach me to feel another's woe, To hide the fault I see; That mercy I to others show, That mercy show to me. Mean though I am, not wholly so, Since quicken'd by my breath; O lead me, whereso'er I go, Through this day's life or death. This day be bread and peace my lot: All else beneath the sun Thou know'st if best bestow'd, or not; And let thy will be done. To Thee, whose temple is all space, Whose altar earth, sea, skies; One chorus let all beings raise, All nature's incense rise! (Pope.) [Come here, fond youth, whoe'er thou be] Come here, fond youth, whoe'er thou be That boast'st to love as well as me; And, if thy breast have felt so wide a wound, Come hither and thy flame approve: I'll teach thee what it is to love, And by what marks true passion may be found. It is to be all bath'd in tears, To live upon a smile for years, Shakspeare has given us similar characteristics of this passion: It is to be made all of sighs and tears;— It is to be all made of faith and service:— It is to be made all of fantasy, All made of passion, and all made of wishes; All adoration, duty, and observance; All humbleness, all patience and impatience; All purity, all trial, all observance. (As You Like It, V. 2.) In a French writer we find a parallel description: Par son respect l' amour vrai se declare; C' est lui qui craint, qui se fuit, qui s' égare; Qui d' un regard fait son suprême bien, Désire tout, prétend peu, n' ose rien. Of which the last line is borrowed from Tasso's Brama assai, poco spera, nulla chiede. To lie whole ages at a beauty's feet; To kneel, to languish, to implore, And still—though she disdain—adore: It is to do all this, and think thy sufferings sweet. It is to gaze upon her eyes With eager joy and fond surprise— Yet temper'd with such chaste and aweful fear, As wretches feel who wait their doom; Nor must one ruder thought presume, Though but in whispers breathed, to meet her ear. It is to hope, though hope were lost, Though heaven and earth thy wishes cross'd: Though she were bright as sainted queens above, And thou the least and meanest swain That folds his flock upon the plain, Yet if thou darest not hope, thou dost not love. It is to quench thy joy in tears, To nurse strange thoughts and groundless fears: If pangs of jealousy thou hast not proved, Though she were fonder and more true Than any nymph old poets drew, O never dream again that thou hast loved. If, when the darling maid is gone, Thou dost not seek to be alone Rapt in a pleasing trance of tender woe; And muse and fold thy languid arms, Feeding thy fancy on her charms, Thou dost not love—for love is nourish'd so. If any hopes thy bosom share, But those which love has planted there, Or any cares but his thy breast enthral; Thou never yet his power hast known: Love sits on a despotic throne, And reigns a tyrant—if he reigns at all. Now, if thou art so lost a thing, Hither thy tender sorrows bring; And prove, whose patience longest can endure: We'll strive whose fancy shall be tost In dreams of fondest passion most— For, if thou thus hast loved, oh! never hope a cure. (Mrs. Barbauld.) THE HOLY LAND, A SEATON PRIZE POEM; 1800. ORIGINALLY DEDICATED TO THE REV. CHARLES SYMMONS, D. D. (And inserted in the ‘Musæ Seatonianæ,’ II. 299.) Crescite felices, Eoæ crescite palmæ. ARGUMENT. Invocation. Palestine invaded by Joshua. Nativity of Christ: His Miracles; and Crucifixion. Destruction of Jerusalem. Pagan, and Mahometan pollutions: Crusades. Pilgrimage over France; Italy; and Greece; by Acre, to Jerusalem. The present unpeopled and unproductive state of Judæa. Conjectures about it's future condition. Allusion to the doctrine of the Millennium. Conclusion. Spirit so lately fled of Him, whose lyre 'Mid it's light Task with strains of holiest theme Oft sounded, and for Sion's songs renounced Th' accomplish'd Sofa's praise, oh yet pursue Thy wonted ministry; and breathe again Accents, which seraphs, from their tuneful toil Pausing, deem'd more than mortal! Oh, 'ere heaven Receive thee, Spirit, for it's loftier airs Impatient, cast that mystic robe below— Thy Cowper's mantle—on the pilgrim muse, And guide to Palestine her destined way. Eventful Palestine! whose hallow'd name, Like some dread spell, from memory's inmost depths With thrilling magic wakes a shadowy train Of joys and woes, thy many-colour'd fate Whence shall the bard begin?—From that bright hour When to thy land, of idol fiends the prey, Remphan and Rimmon and the crew obscene Of Bäalim, th' avenger Israel rush'd; And Jordan, in it's pride of summer-flood “For Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest.” (Josh. iii. 15.) Roll'd backward, own'd his mission. In the van March'd Havock, and with Canaan's guilty line Strew'd the red plain, from utmost Sidon north To Gaza's frontier bound. With equal stroke Th' impartial steel smote manhood's towering crest, And nerveless age: the buckler of her charms, Which erst repell'd the blunted shafts of war, Even Beauty rear'd in vain. The bastion's strength, Whose front impregnable defied th' assault Of sturdiest enginry, subdued by sound Sank: and th' auxiliar sun, to human voice Then first obedient, o'er th' ensanguined field Stay'd his fleet coursers. Such the righteous doom Of realms, apostate from their Lord: such doom The victor felt, as oft his knee forsook Jehovah's altar; or in battle bow'd Beneath Philistim's spear, or scourged with plagues (Disastrous option! 2 Sam. xxiv. 13.) or for many a year Crush'd by Assyria's fetters. Still unfill'd His sin's deep measure, and his sufferings still Less than extreme; 'till Heaven's Anointed came, And God rejected crown'd his crimes and woes. Whence was that star, which through the blue profound From eastern climes advancing, hung it's lamp O'er royal Bethlehem; not with comet-glare Portending war to nations, but of ray Pacific? 'Twas the harbinger of morn: That Sun's glad herald, from whose living spring Natures scarce finite in perennial stream Draw floods of intellect, and bathe in light Strong beyond human ken. In thickest cloud Shrouding his native glories, lest the blaze Of orient Deity with mortal flash Should blast the gazer's vision, He arose— So darken'd, yet refulgent. Through the cell Of maniac Guilt, exulting in his chain, Darted the sudden dawn. Their rigid clasp Instant his bonds remit: with night's foul train His cherish'd phrensy flies; and freed he springs, On faith's firm wing, to liberty and heaven. Those deeds, high-favour'd Land, 'twas thine to see In that bright day of wonders, which have shed O'er all thy lakes and hills a holy light, Glowing with inextinguishable flame, Though thou and thine are prostrate. In the dust Thy relics shine; and deep-indented still, By time's aye-rolling billows uneffaced, The pilgrim tracks the footsteps of his God. Ah! deeds—the pride of Israel, and his shame! His pride, that unto him alone display'd The mighty Workman stood, of other eyes Seen by reflected beam; his shame, and crime Of costliest expiation (yet unpaid— Though Scorn with finger stretch'd, and biting Wrong, Untired pursue the exile) that He stood Display'd in vain! Yet Nature knew her Prince; And prompt, as when at first th' Almighty Word Awed the conflicting elements to peace, Obey'd his powerful voice. Th' infuriate storm, Which with rough pinion swept Judæa's wave, Fled at his bidding; and in stillest calm Th' obsequious surface slept. On restless couch Wan Fever pined: He spake, and ruddy health Sprang from her roseate bower, with pristine bloom To light the faded cheek. Departed saints, Dread spectacle! their yawning tombs forsook, To hail the Victim-God. But Israel saw, Prompt at his voice, th' infuriate storm retire; Saw ruddy health on Fever's faded cheek Shed pristine bloom; saw yawning sepulchres Resign their shrouded captives—sceptic still, And unconvinced; nay, to th' accursed tree (Oh guilt, most worthy of the Flavian sword, And centuries of anguish!) doom'd his King, And stretch'd his own Messiah on the cross. From the black west, in Salem's evil hour, The tempest came; and 'round her glittering domes Raved the resistless blast. Beneath it's rage, Which never burst upon a nobler prey, Sank in wide ruin whelm'd her triple wall, And temple's golden splendor. Far away, Born in her summer-beam, on rapid wing Fled revelry and song. In scornful state, Raised by the fierce invader, idol forms (Jove, and Adonis, and th' Idalian Queen “Ab Hadriani temporibus usque ad imperium Constantini, per annos circiter centum octoginta, in loco Resurrectionis simulacrum Jovis, in Crucis rupe statua ex marmore Veneris à gentibus posita colebatur; existimantibus persecutionis auctoribus, quòd tollerent nobis fidem Resurrectionis et Crucis, si loca sancta per idola polluissent. Bethleem nunc nostram, et augustissimum orbis locum, de quo Psalmista canit (Ixxxiv. 12.) “Veritas de terrâ orto est,” lucus inumbrabat Thamuz, i. e. Adonidis; et in specu, ubi quondam Christus parvulus vagiit, Veneris amasius plangebatur.” (Hieron. Epist. ad Paulin.)) Mark'd to th' indignant traveller's shrinking glance, Where Earth first heard her Saviour's infant wail; Where, with keen throe, she felt his mortal pang; And where she saw Him rise, death's conquering Lord, Pure from Corruption's touch, by proper force Triumphant. But imperial Constantine Redeem'd the hallow'd soil, and from their base The guilty mockeries push'd. In after-times, When his false Koran on the captive's breast With his sharp steel th' impostor Arab graved, Fast by God's fallen fane A Turkish mosque now usurps the site of Solomon's Temple. it's gorgeous horns The crescent lifting high, to pious wrath Goaded the stern crusader, and impell'd To chase pollution from th' insulted hill. O'er Christendom's rude plains with frantic yell The Red-Cross Hermit flew, his crimson flag Waving aloft, and to the holy tomb Summon'd her barbarous tribes. Through climes unknown, At his wild whoop, in rout fanatic rush'd Th' enthusiast myriads: on their scatter'd rear Hung Famine, meagre fiend, with shrivell'd lips Blasting the yellow harvest. Ætna thus, Deep-heaving, from her darksome caverns pours The fiery surge; and sad Sicilia mourns Her buried hopes. Their woes were long to tell, Where all was woe; 'till Salem's rescued streets Smoked with her tyrants' blood. Then, thrown aside The wearied sword, and hush'd the battle's roar— Up Calvary's mount the barefoot victors toil'd, Kiss'd the blest stone, and melted into tears. See Gibbon's ‘Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,’ chap. Iviii. (XI. 85.) and Hume's ‘History of England,’ I. 333. Neither of these historians, however, seem fully to sustain the conjecture, that “six millions upon the first summons of Peter the Hermit assumed the cross:” though Robertson, in his ‘Charles V.’ I. 28., states it on the concurring testimony of contemporary authors, some of whom (particularly Fulcherius Carnotensis, the sixth of the ten published by Bongarsius under the fanatic title of ‘Gesta Dei per Francos’) had accompanied this destructive expedition. Even now to Sion's aweful solitudes, Roused by th' inspiring theme, the Muse directs Her towering course. O'er Gallia's far-spread land Hurrying, with tearful eye she marks the shrine By impious hands to harlot Reason rear'd; From her bruised shield the lily's silver pride Effaced, and high-born Capet's nameless tomb. In war's dread garb the village-swain array'd, The noiseless city, and forsaken field Crowd on her glance, and force her pitying sigh. Thus, view'd at distance, Egypt's giant piles Attract the stranger's foot. With lagging step He winds amazed around their ample base, And climbs with straining gaze th' aërial spire; Within, pale Death, in grisly pomp enthroned, Rules the twin realms of silence and the grave. Vergniaud, the eloquent friend of Brissot, in answer to a pernicious motion of Robespierre, once observed: “Vous vaincrez vos ennemis—je le crois: mais la France, epuisée par les efforts faits pour vaincre ses ennemis exterieurs, dechirée par les factions, sera encore epuisée par les hommes, par l'argent qu'il aura fallu tirer de son sein; et craignez qu'clle ne ressemble à ces antiques monumens, qu'on retrouve en Egypte. L'etranger, qui les aperçoit, s'étonne de leur grandeur: s'il y pénètre, qu' y trouve-t-il? —Des cendres inanimées, et le silence des tombeaux.” Thence, over Alpine heights, Ausonia's bowers The wanderer greets; her plains of old renown, And Mincio's sinuous stream—ah! stream, no more Conscious of Maro's sylvan minstrelsy, Whose oaten reed to the responsive woods Sung beauteous Amaryllis. Other sounds Burst on her startled ear, the shrill-toned fife, Trumpet, and drum, and all the clanging war; And urge her way to Tiber's trophied shore. On Tiber's trophied shore, in fate's dark cloud His terrors quench'd, the Latian eagle lies; Whose plume, exulting 'mid the blaze of day, Defied the vulgar shaft. She sees, and weeps Her Rome's departed glories. More she weeps The lofty spirit fled, and proud disdain Of tyrant power, and virtue's vestal flame. Across th' Ionian next by Delphi's steep, The forked mount, and famed Castalia's spring To Athens, scene of all her infant joys, Anxious she speeds. But there nor Pictured Porch Glowing with various life, nor Virgin's fane, Nor marble breathing from the Phidian hand Meets her sad eye. By Rome's fell lightning scathed With partial blast, at Othman's withering touch Th' Athenian amaranth died: the servile brow No chaplet binds. Yet other sorrows wound, With keener pang, the Muse's gentle breast. There in his early bloom, 'mid classic dust Once warm with grace and genius like his own, Her favourite John Tweddell, Esq. M. A., late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. The close of these lines may, perhaps, feebly recal to the reader's mind the conclusion of the subjoined Hendecasyllables, of exquisite beauty.

D. 1191, to the assailants, reinforced by the arrival of the Kings of England and France, who for some time “acted by concert, and shared the honour and danger of every action.”—“This harmony, however (the historian adds) was of short duration, and occasions of discord soon arose between these jealous and haughty princes.” (Hume.) towers to soft repose Invite the way-worn pilgrim.

It is a notion, however, by no means confined to the Holy City. A similar honour, if it be one, has been claimed by Xenophon for Athens: and for Delphi, among others, by Euripides, Orest. 325., where the Scholiast relates the story, upon which the epithet ?????????? rests; and with his statement his brother annotator on Pindar, Pyth. iv., nearly agrees. Ovid (Metam. x. 168.) adopts the tradition; and the later Roman poets (Claudian, Prol. in Cons. Mall. Theod., and Statius, Theb. I. 118.) only differ from him by applying it, with a venial partiality, to Parnassus in the immediate neighbourhood. Pliny, likewise (H. N. XI. 58.) asserts this privilege of central position to Abydus. A passage, in favour of the claim of Jerusalem, is quoted by Johnson from Sir John Mandeville. (Hist. Eng. Language.) The Brahmins deem Benares, as too excellent to constitute a portion of this perishable globe, a gem studding it's centre! throne, And rule with golden sway the circling world. Oh! come that day of glory, that bright speck Far in the dim horizon's utmost verge By Prophecy's unerring finger mark'd To Faith's strong eye—when, with th' innumerous good Of every age, the white-robed saint shall stray Through groves of paradise, and drink unquench'd Th' exhaustless stream of science!

From whose keen spear the atheist crew appall'd Shrunk to their native night—with all, whose voice And harmonising life in virtue's cause Their blended rhetoric pour'd, shall shine as stars; Glowing in heaven's eternal firmament With beam unchanged, while suns and worlds decay. THE RAISING OF JAÏRUS' DAUGHTER, A POEM; 1803. ORIGINALLY DEDICATED TO WALTER FAWKES, ESQ. Sed revocare gradum— (Virg. Æn. vi. 128.) Death's iron slumbers chased, th' expectant tomb 'Reft of it's prey, and o'er the clay-cold cheek Life's refluent lustre shooting, theme for less Than seraph's harp too high, with trembling hand The bard essays. Aonian mockeries, hence! Back to your Pindus, nor let foot profane Vex the chaste ground. 'Twas yours of yore to sing, How with his lyre's soft magic Orpheus thrill'd The ear of Dis; and from his doleful realm, But that nor love nor pity dwelt in hell, Had borne Eurydice: the strain of truth Claims loftier inspiration. O be thou, Blest Faith (as 'tis thy wont, 'mid scenes of fate, With heaven's own strength to nerve the sinking soul) The Christian poet's Muse; on wing of flame Buoy his faint flight, and guide him through the gloom. For lo! where tossing on her restless couch Meagre and flush'd, the food of hectic fires, Gasps in weak conflict with the mortal fiend Capernaum's lovely daughter; gasps in vain, Beneath his withering grasp. Nor art can lure, Nor might can shake him from his destined spoil. Vainly to him sweet Innocence her palms Spreads suppliant, and entreats with many a tear Short respite from her death-pangs: Youth in vain Pleads his brief hopes, or ere they bloom, decay'd; In sudden midnight quench'd his morning sun, His glittering day-dreams fled! The sigh of Love, Breath'd from the inmost soul; pure Friendship's prayer. Which fain with life would buy the life she craves; Affection's tender prompt solicitude, Keen to explore and eager to relieve The want, just hinted by the asking glance— All fruitless to arrest the ebbing blood, Or check the pulse, with mad precipitance Fast hurrying to it's goal! But who shall tell The woe Jaïrus feels, as fix'd he marks In her (so late his bosom's foremost pride) The quivering livid lip, it's long farewell Faint whispering; turn'd to him the dying look, Him anxious seeking with it's latest beam, And fondly lingering on the much-loved face! Ah! whither shall he bend his soul's sad view? Where find repose? The future, once so bright, When Hope and Fancy sketch'd the happy groups Dear to a grandsire's breast, appals him now With horror's direst forms—the shrouded corse, The bier, the black procession. Scared he shrinks, And back through many a well-remember'd year Darts his quick eye: but O yet deeper pangs Lie ambush'd there! Too faithful to the past, Officious Memory throngs the living scene With all the father's joys—the fond caress, The heart-sprung smile, the glance intelligent, The speaking gesture, and the courted knee, Throne of the babe's delight! In dumb despair, Dumbness to which all eloquence is mute, He hides his countenance. At Aulis thus, When 'midst assembled Greece his knife of death Stern Calchas brandish'd o'er the victim-maid, Forth from the circling host in various guise Burst the wild passions, by immortal art Stamp'd on the glowing canvas. The pretended marriage with Achilles, which Ulysses suggested as a lure to draw Iphigenia to Aulis, with the substitution of a stag for the royal victim, and the daring originality with which Timanthes represented the agonies of Agamemnon in his picture of the Sacrifice, are too well known to need detail. Furious here The frantic mother raved; there prostrate sued The weeping friend; Achilles half unsheath'd His mighty blade, ?????? ?? ?? ??????? ???? ?????.(Hom. Il. a. 194.) and Telamon's brave son Then first knew terror. Even Ulysses felt Thrill through his icy heart the sudden throe, And wish'd uncounsell'd now his prosperous wile. Apart in majesty of grief, with face (Beyond the painter's happiest mimicry) Wrapp'd in his lifted robe, Atrides stood Sadly pre-eminent; and art was hail'd Even in defeat triumphant. But avaunt Tales of the Tauric huntress, and the hind Vicarious, and the rescued nymph, though told In strains of deathless glory. Holier song Befits the Christian bard, whose golden lyre Should own no string, that sounds to aught but heaven. Borne on that sigh, her gentle spirit rose Buoyant through yon blue concave; and shook off (Half angel, ere it fled) it's beauteous clay: Amidst the trifling discordancy of the Evangelists, which occurs in this place, it may be proper to state that I have followed St. Matthew. To it's bright home by sister-seraphs led, And by glad myriads of the sainted just Greeted with hymns of triumph. So the lark, Late in some sunless cottage-nook confined, The toy of froward youth, if chance throw wide It's prison-doors and bid the captive range Free as it's kindred choir, with strange delight Hears and obeys; and, soaring to the skies, Floats on light plume amid the liquid noon. Nare per æstatem liquidam. (Virg. Georg. iv. 59.) O ye, around whose knee a daughter's arms (As, tottering on, she hail'd your wish'd return) Have fondly fasten'd; whose transported ear Has drunk the prattler's accents, as she lisp'd Your welcome back with many a proffer'd kiss, And smiles which art would emulate in vain— Weep for the lost Jaïrus. Ye have known What 'twas, amid the million cares and woes (Man's hapless lot below) to find at home That magic circle, o'er whose charmed round, Save by the guidance of the wizard fates, Nor cares nor woes intrude. O pause and think, Even in your noontide blaze of rapture think, If God his fostering beam should turn aside, What darkness may be yours! and, while ye kneel In grateful fervor to protecting heaven, In generous sadness for Jaïrus weep. No; o'er his agonies rejoice: rejoice, That sharpest suffering led his anxious step To life's pure source, and bade him from that fount Exhaustless drink and live. With show of hate Thus oft kind Mercy, mask'd in anger's guise, Smites whom she loves. The mad tornado oft Sweeps on rough wing across a smiling land; And what was Eden ere the spoiler came, Lies a waste wilderness: but thence the breeze, Which stagnant erst in sultry stillness slept, Is quicken'd into health, and genial gales Play round the languid temple. “Tempests occasionally shake our dwellings and dissipate our commerce, but they scourge before them the lazy elements, which without them would stagnate into pestilence. In like manner Liberty herself, the last and best gift of God to his creatures, must be taken just as she is. You might pare her down into bashful regularity, and shape her into a model of severe scrupulous law; but she would, then, be Liberty no longer: and you must be content to die under the lash of this inexorable Justice, which you had exchanged for the bannera of Freedom.” (Erskine's Speech for Stockdale, II. 268.) Borne from far, Where Nubia melts beneath the burning day, Oft the broad torrent with resistless flood Whelms infant Spring; and trembling Egypt views O'er his soft bloom the wide-spread deluge close: Yet thence emerging soon the rosy boy, With lusty sinew by the billow strung, Quaffs the rich tide and thrives at every pore. Haste then to Christ, and prostrate at his feet, With hope's bright ardor glowing in thine heart, Implore his sovereign aid. To that blest ear The good man's sorrows never rise in vain. O tell him that thy child, thy manhood's joy, Th' expected grace and guardian of thine age, In Death's chill gripe has wither'd, like a flower Scathed by the summer-storm.—But no; forbear! He knows thy woes: thy bosom's inmost pulse Throbs to his eye. And lo, with eager haste Zealous through thronging crowds he presses on, At thine and Pity's summons! Stay him not, Ye curious, ye diseased: And thou, whose blood Twelve tedious springs th' insatiate plague Mark v. 29.has drain'd, Catch not his robe; though thou art wretched too, Revere a parent's anguish. Wondrous man! Even from his hem, by Faith's pure finger touch'd, The healing virtue flows, nor aught delays His onward foot. And now the deafening din Of minstrel mourners marks the drear abode, Where fast the maiden slumbers; undisturb'd By wailing friends, the deep funercal dirge, And all the pomp of grief. And now her hand The Saviour takes; now from th' almighty lip Issues the irresistible decree, “Damsel, arise.” Her mortal sleep dispell'd, And life's new vigour tingling through her veins, Instant she wakes, as from a raptured dream Chased by the morn's soft whisper; and beholds, With all the daughter rushing to her eyes, Her father by her side. O what was then His gush of joy, as to his bounding heart He caught, he clasp'd her close! Not more the bliss The patriot hero feels, whose lifted arm Guards his loved prince, while round his country's coasts Invasion's hovering harpies scream for prey: Not more his bliss when, sheath'd the hallow'd steel (It's work of glory done, and in the dust Th' insulting foe laid low) with honest toil, 'Mid the dear pledges of domestic love, He tills the fields his unbought valour saved. And so when, sign of universal doom, 'Midst heaven's circumference yon golden orb Shall veil his flaming forehead; and the moon, Portentous phase! on æther's azure vest Glare a red blood-spot—while in fearful course Athwart or backward, whirling through the void, The lawless planets rush; and earth, convulsed, Deep to her centre shakes—on Death's dull ear Again the thrilling voice shall burst, again From his gaunt grasp the shrouded victim rend, And pour through all his caves empyreal day. No single corse, as when with joy's wild throb Close to his heaving breast Jaïrus strain'd His rescued child; but swarms, to equal whom Night's spangled host or Libya's world of sand Were faint comparison, to sudden life Shall start amazed. With keen compunction some, Self-sentenced ere they meet their righteous Judge, Shall to the crashing rocks and mountains cry To screen them from his presence. Fruitless prayer! Nor rocks, nor whelming mountains, can subdue The conscious bosom's anguish: deep within Coil'd round their life-strings lies th' immortal worm, And gnaws with sharp remorse the quivering heart. Others (and O may he, whose feeble hand Frames this weak verse, the chosen number swell!) Their mortal clay resign'd, in heavenly forms Shall rise, resplendent as the summer-sun Even in his midday lustre; and with bliss, O'erpaying years of bitterest agony, Hear the glad accents: “Faithful servants, come; “Receive your promised meed. Your toils were great, “And great is their reward. The God ye served, “Steadfast when Passion sapp'd and Scorn assail'd, “He, He is yours: for you is twined the wreath “Of Eden's greenest amaranth, and for you “Flung wide th' eternal portals. Enter in, “Your task complete, your race of duty run, “And share the joys and glories of your Lord.” THE SUFFERINGS OF THE PRIMITIVE MARTYRS: A SEATON PRIZE POEM, 1811. ORIGINALLY DEDICATED TO MRS. GRANT, AUTHORESS OF THE ‘DISSERTATION ON THE SUPERSTITIONS OF THE HIGHLANDERS OF SCOTLAND.’ “?Dabit Deus kis quoque finem.” ARGUMENT. Introduction. Stephen; and his Jewish Persecutors. Nero burns Rome; and charges the crime upon the Christians. First Persecution: Peter and Paul suffer; the former crucified with his head downward. Domitian causes Clemens, his collegue in the Consulship, to be martyred, and banishes his widow Domitilla to Pandataria. St. John exiled to Patmos, where he writes the Apocalypse. Ignatius thrown to wild beasts. Polycarp burnt. Pliny, Proconsul of Bithynia.—The English Martyrs; Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, &amp;c. Apostrophe to Faith. Affliction no test of demerit. Other species of Martyrdom: Missionaries; the Macleods, &amp;c. Conclusion. 'Tis seal'd. From Rome's dread Autocrat proceeds The Mandate, with unconscious evidence Stablishing the sure word prophetical, That ‘they who will in Jesus godly live Shall suffer persecution.’ 2 Tim. iii. 12. This 'twas thine First, Stephen, to attest (in Christian tomes Thence Proto-martyr named) ere Nero yet His crimson rescript issued; thine to see, As on thy bruised form beat the stony shower, Thy Saviour on his throne of adamant Seated by God's right-hand. It's pearled gates Heaven opens wide to cheer, before they close In momentary sleep, Acts vii. 60. thy languid eyes, And with it's own effulgence gild thy brow: O rapture far surpassing all thy pangs, Were they ten thousandfold; when thy worst foes, Struck with the sudden lustre, in thy face Discern reflected Deity, Ib. vi. 15. and shrink, Even while they perpetrate the deed of blood! Ah tottering temple! ah devoted towers! Ah wretched race, beloved of God in vain! How with thine own Messiah dost thou wage Unequal war, and on his embassies Heap contumely and anguish! Lifted erst By his strong arm from error's deathful shade, To thee, high-favour'd One, 'twas given to catch On thy tall pinnacles the purple dawn, And glow while all was dreariest gloom around. As when his tube some Herschel to the moon, Crescent or waning, points, intent to note And fathom all her depths, fast by her marge Of some proud mount he marks the golden top Glittering with heaven's first beam, while at it's foot Flows darkness; so did'st thou, Judæa, rise— Thou radiant singly, 'midst a world of night! —But thou art fall'n; and who shall weep thy fate? Yet stormier days the growing Church await, And keener woes. With devilish malice bent, Tremendous frolic! to renew the scene Of burning Troy, the felon prince applies His secret torch; and, ere the night's pale orb Has reach'd it's noon, with more than rival flame Rome reddens. Perish in that mortal blaze Phidias, and Myron, and Praxiteles, The pride of ancient Greece; and more than these, Perish the Valour which achieved, the Taste Which prized the rich possession, Intellect, Youth, Beauty, Innocence, beneath the sweep Of the wide-wasting fury. He meanwhile Perch'd, heartless ravager! like some foul bird, That croaks and scents the carnage of the field, From his safe battlements surveys afar The beauteous glare, and with his lyre derides The ruin he has caused.

Can hands, held up in prayer Unto a God of love, his creatures doom To crimeless, cureless wretchedness? Yes—so Nero pronounces, their Accuser-Judge; And other fires are kindled. Wrapp'd in coats Bituminous, or in the shaggy spoil Of Libyan lioness, alternately They blaze a living flambeau; or engaged In conflict strange with brutes (though savage these, Less savage than the fiend who let them slip) They die by the stern gripe of horrid fangs; Or, dragg'd along the crowded hippodrome, With head supine in the empurpled sand Trace the prolific furrow. Sanguis Martyrum semen Ecclesiæ. Then fell ye, Peter and Paul, through many a toilsome day Your race of duty run; fell but to rise, Where long your pure ambition had aspired, From earth to paradise. Inverted there, As loth to rival even upon the Cross His Saviour, Cephas hangs; how changed from him, Who once with oaths that Saviour disavow'd, And back from death recoil'd, as from a thing Which heaven would poorly compensate! Where now Thy gorgeous dreams of hierarchal state, The sceptre and the crosier intertwined, Themes of thy morning-visions? Vanish'd all; Or rather for a more enduring pomp, Wreaths æther-dipt and crowns above the stars, Richly exchanged. But Bigotry demands Her breathing-space. Not always can her sword Drink blood, not always blaze her murtherous pyre. Brief time she pauses. O'er the Capitol, Ere many a year has roll'd, it's baleful orb The Flavian meteor lifts; and by it's beam, Of his own lictors victim, Clemens dies. Him not the majesty of fasces borne Conjunctive, nor the softer charities Domestical, protect from the fell sway Of his Imperial Collegue. But he falls, Not singly stricken by the storm.

'Twere long to character the subtile hate, Which hunted David's issue, bent to crush Messiah's kindred lineage; “Domitian murthered all the nephews of Jude, called ‘the Lord's Brethren,’ and slew all he could find of the stock of David, as Vespasian did before him, lest any of that race should enjoy the kingdom.”—“Some of the stock of David were brought to Domitian to be slain; but he, finding them to be poor simple unlearned men who, as it appeared by the hardness and callousness of their hands, worked hard for their bread, and discovering that Christ's Kingdom (which they were always talking about, and which indeed seemed to be the cause of all the Emperor's jealousy) was not of this world, but divine and heavenly, they were soon dismissed.” to the gaunt And famish'd tigress gave Theophorus, By this name Ignatius designated himself, as meaning “One who has Christ in his breast,” in his interview with Trajan, A. D. 107. See Milner's excellent ‘History of the Church of Christ,’ I. 166— 190. The two letters likewise of the Proconsul of Bithynia, and the emperor Trajan in the same volume (160—162) do indeed, as Mr. M. observes, abundantly prove that “virtue in Pliny's writings, and virtue in St. Paul's, mean not the same thing.” See Plin. Epist. X. 97, 98. Polycarp was Bishop of Smyrna. Antioch's good Bishop, and with fire's dread scourge Smote mitred Polycarp. ‘His ashes flew, No marble tells us whither.’ Cowper. Rome could point Of yore, when darkness veil'd her Vatican, To where each several relic was enshrined, Single or duplicate; for might we trust The legendary lore apocryphal Of that long night, each martyr'd saint would seem (So crowded is her hallow'd charnel-house) Geryon, or fabled Briareus! “All the graves and catacombs were exhausted to furnish Relics: not a bone, not the least scrap of any saint, that was not removed into the holy wardrobe, to raise money to the showers. Where the monuments were dubious and blended, the names and bodies of pagan slaves were taken into the Church-calendar and treasury. Disputes and quarrels arose among the numerous pretenders to one and the same relic, which could never be decided; but the victory was various and alternate, according to the fruitful inventions and ingenious lies of the contending impostors.” (Bentley's Sermon at Cambridge, Nov. 5, 1715.) This however, it should be remembered, was written very nearly a hundred years ago, and but a little week before the first rebellious attempt to supersede the Brunswicks by the Stuarts had been happily suppressed by the actions at Preston and Dumblaine. The learned preacher himself admits, in the sequel of his Discourse, that “Popery since the Reformation had, even in it's own quarters, permitted learning and humanity:” and I myself some years ago, addressing an Academical audience, ventured to express my conviction that “Time, the grand agent in diffusing intellectual and civil blessings, had not passed over the Vatican alone” without leaving behind him a share of his bounties. Whether, indeed, the relative state of the Romish (even Gallican) and English church be accurately expressed by Archbishop Wake in his last Letter to the Ecclesiastical Historian Dupin, In dogmatibus, prout à te candidè proponuntur, non admodùm dissentimus, I may still be permitted to retain the Academicorum ?????: but our remaining differences are surely not of a nature to justify the withholding of those rights, which the more temperate Irish Catholics now claim at our hands; even if policy did not appear most vehemently to urge the concession, and the example of Catholic states entrusting themselves with unabused confidence to the Protestants Saxe and Neckar and Wurmser and Alvinzy could not be pleaded against us, and the names of Burke and Windham and Grenville and Grey and Pitt and Fox (a Sextumvirate, to which it would be difficult in these times to add a seventh) were not marshalled in their favour. Archdeacon Balguy's Discourses contain a very spirited charge on Religious Liberty. Thou too, If sedulously full the lay aspired To trace Religion's triumphs and her tears, Her corporal suffrances, her bosom'd joys; Thou too, Bithynia's ruler, should'st attest (Even while thou doom'st) her zeal, impregnable To earthly fears or hopes; and prove how far, Gentlest as thou wert deem'd of pagan kind, The Christian's clemency surpass'd thine own. You the bard may not sing, As Martyrs, entitled to the appellation of primitive only by their creed and their lives. I have made no mention of the infant victims of heathen persecution, the ?flores martyrum, Quos lucis ipso in limine Christi insecutor sustulit, Ceu turbo nascentes rosas; (Prudent. ???? ????.) though I am not ignorant of the distinctions made upon the subject by the early Christian Writers, particularly Gregor.

Thus through their frame Thou breathest the buoyant spirit, undepress'd By dungeons damp where Pestilence collects Her choicest stores, by chains unmanacled, And by those ties uncheck'd whose tender force Even in death's hour, when other bonds dissolve, With tightening pressure grasps the beating heart. And deem we those forsaken of their Lord, Who in the perilous time when Murther, mask'd In saintly garb, with ravenous tooth devour'd His myriads at a meal, Young. defied the fiend— Because they sunk within his withering clutch? Then have we vainly read, that God in love Scourges his favour'd sons, and by the keen And bleaching winter of adversity Braces and purifies: then have we read Vainly, that ‘light and momentary pangs, Encounter'd firmly for the Crucified, With heavenly glory's everlasting weight Bear not comparison.’ Rom. viii. 18. ?????? ?? ????????? ??????? ????????, ??? ???????? ??????? ? ?????? ?????, ??? ? ??? ???? ?????? ?????????? ?? ?? ????? ?? ??????. ??? ??? ?? ???? ???????? ??? ??????????, ? ????? ????? ????????? ??????? ??? ????? ???????????? ?????? ????????????????, ?. ?. ?.

Who not waits, When sceptred Glo'ster stalks in guilty pomp, Expectant—till on Bosworth's righteous field, Avenging the brief triumphs of his pride, The crown'd assassin bleeds? When Epopee Leads forth her shadowy phalanx, who condemns, If for a little space Vice rears his crest, Towering o'er prostrate Innocence? Anon, She lifts her candid front: the clouds disperse, And in the sun-bright throng of coming years She hails her high reward. Nor fears the wretch, Whom Justice summons to his country's bar— Be but that country England—that his judge, Or ere the long-spun narrative be closed, Will with impatient spleen pronounce his doom. No: 'tis but when th' Unerring Artist weaves His plots mysterious, we explore the work With blind precipitation, madly hiss As passion prompts, and heedless of the sure Though late catastrophe, with daring hand Hurl our weak bolt before the curtain falls. And is there then no martyrdom, beside The wheel and cross? With mingled joy and pain Thrills there no heart save his, who at the stake, When Nature shrinks from the resistless flame, Feels strong within him the sustaining God? Answer me ye, who traverse Greenland's wastes, And 'mid her regions of perennial snow Plant Sharon's rose! Or answer ye, who brave In climes of torrid fire the yellow plague: Or, where it's inland sea Ontario spreads, Fearless unto his lonely haunt pursue The sullen savage; destined to receive, Haply, from the dire object of your toils Your mortal stroke! Nor shall ye of the Muse Sleep unremember'd in your distant tomb, Gallant Macleods, For an account of the sufferings and steadfastness of these ‘noble Martyrs,’ see Mrs. Grant's late interesting ‘Essays on the Superstitions of the Highlanders of Scotland,’ II. 138—142. The regiment, of which they formed a part, consisted of Highlanders from the Isles, under the command of a General Macleod; and I have therefore ventured to distinguish them all, on the principle of clanship, by his name. Of above two hundred, who fell into the hands of Tippoo Saib, very few survived. Their sad story is detailed, with nearly historical accuracy, in the above lines. Warmly has the same delightfully-national Authoress of ‘Letters from the Mountains’ proclaimed, “These must not sleep in darkness and in death.” whom war's precarious game Gave to Mysore's remorseless prince. By day The fervid noon, and drenching dews by night, Alternate parch'd and chill'd you. Food was yours, Which Famine lothed to taste. No soothing voice, Honour's firm tone, or whisper'd hope of fame, Lured, animated, solaced. Far from all That nerves the soul, the sympathising friend, Th' applauding world; from Caledonia far, Loved by her sons beyond all other loves, Ye met the shock, though life and liberty (Such liberty, as despots can bestow!) Clung to the offer'd turban; and with faith Primeval, worthy of a nobler lyre, Spurn'd the rich bait. As some fair cluster'd flowers, Which in the desert waste their transient sweets, Shrivell'd by heat or shivering in the storm, Ye died. Now life and liberty are yours— Such liberty as despots cannot give, Such life as despots cannot take away! But why her vagrant course to realms remote, Arctic or tropic, or the myriad isles Nameless in thick profusion scatter'd o'er The vast Pacific, bends th' excursive Muse? Answer her ye, who in your Saviour's cause Even from the babbling of compatriot tongues The worldling's specious scoffings have endured, And infidel's light gibes. Yet hostile shafts, Barb'd with sharp sophistry or venom'd sneer, Glance from the breast in panoply of faith Securely mail'd. But who unpain'd can bear, When friend encounters friend, the pitying glance, Pitying or scornful; who the kind reproach, Which chides to serve, and wounds because it loves? Yet flinch not Thou, or from the pitying eye, Or chiding tongue; on some triumphant day Doom'd haply from thy Master to receive (Fruit of thy firmness, and it's recompence!) That friend's conversion. Grappled to thee then By sympathy, than steeled hook more strong, How will he bless the pious stubbornness, Which won him from his error? How delight To mix sweet counsels in the house of God, Catch from thy glowing lip intenser flame, And with united incense perfume heaven! O friendship worthy of the sacred name, Transporting intercourse for fawning crowds Ill-barter'd; when two harmonising souls, From the world's feverish bustle far removed, Together pour their humble orisons Of prayer and praise, or with consentient glance Explore creation's wonders! Happier still, Ah then most happy they of human kind, If to the raptured pair the holy names Of Sire and Son belong! Deep in their hearts The memory lives of many a tender look, And many a fond caress. The hawthorn'd vale Hand link'd in hand they traverse, Health and Peace And Competence attending, or ascend The mountain's brow, or on the ocean-beach Stray the long summer-morn. With varied voice Beach, vale, and mountain hymn their maker God. They join in nature's concert. Tutor'd thus And fitted for eternity, though Death Sever by fate's decree the hallow'd bond, Fly but a few short years, they re-unite With all the Martyr'd, all the Sainted Just Of every age, their earthly warfare o'er— Welcome, blest hour!—no more to part, in heaven. JOSEPH MADE KNOWN TO HIS BRETHREN: A SEATON PRIZE POEM, 1812. QRIGINALLY DEDICATED TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF LEEDS. O qui complexus, et gaudia quanta fuerunt! (Hor. Serm. I. v. 43.) Around the Memphian board See Geddes on Gen. xlv. 10. p. 138, Crit. Rem.; where he doubts whether the seat of government was fixed at Memphis, Heliopolis (On, Gen. xli. 45.), or Tanis. Patrick, from the Zoan of Ps. lxxviii. 43., places it at the latter. the patriarchs sit, And plenty crowns the banquet, plenty long To their sunk eyes unknown. With wonder each, Even in the hall of strangers, views himself By Zaphnath-paaneah's high command (Such name in grateful Egypt Ipsumque Ægypto præficiens, per annos octoginta (comp. Gen. xli. 46., and l. 26.) purpurâ vestitum et coronâ coronatum in curru aureo incedere fecit: et quùm virtute omni admirabilis esset, omnia ratione disponebat, et potestate concessâ omnibus in rebus humiliter utebatur, quæ res hujusmodi felicitatis apud Ægyptios causa fuit.

In this last paragraph the Chronicler, probably, refers to that amiable trait of the Ægyptian character, which disposed them (according to Diod. Sic. lib. I.) ????????? ?????????? ???? ??? ?? ??????????. Clement of Alexandria likewise informs us, in the First book of his Stromata, that ????? ????????? ??? ???????????—??????????? ???????.

And Naphtali, with Zilpah's offspring, Gad And Asher, on whose line wait happier days And regal dainties, Ib. xlix. 20. That Sir William Drummond in his ‘Œdipus Judaïcus,’ following generally Kircher and Dupuis, has attempted to resolve Jacob's prophecies in this chapter into a series of astronomical allusions to the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, I am not ignorant. He differs from his predecessors, indeed, in assigning Gemini to Benjamin; and there appears, throughout, a great lack of correspondence in the succession of the two corresponding dozens: not to mention, that in referring Zebulun to Capricorn (to which, however, Gad seems to have what, in any other case, the Right Honourable Author would probably have deemed irresistible pretensions) he is obliged to take for granted, that Kircher had “found some tradition,” though “he has not given the slightest intimation,” upon the subject; and that the parallelism of Manasseh and Sagittarius he has left wholly “to the ingenuity of his readers to supply!!” They seem, indeed, to fall to each other, merely because they are the unappropriated relics of their respective series! But that Reuben is typical of Aquarius, Simeon and Levi of Pisces, Judah of Leo, Issachar of Cancer, Dan of Scorpius, Gad of Aries, Asher of Libra, Naphtali of Virgo, and Ephriam of Taurus, and that Shiloh is a bright star (Shuleh) in Scorpius, is elaborately contended in a profound Essay of forty-three pages!!! crouching Issachar, And Zebulun; last, from his anxious sire Reluctant torn, ingenuous Benjamin The circle fills. In blameless revelry The sparkling cup goes round; Ib. xliii. and Want and Woe, Lull'd by the scene, relax their horrid grasp. Why 'midst this universal merriment, The mantling goblet and the festal blaze, Fastens on Benjamin the banquet's Lord Such look intense, as beams in fondest hour From doting parent's eye? Liberal to all, Why to the youngest, with selection nice Cull'd from the table's choicest luxuries, Sends he in the o'erflowing of his soul The five-fold mess? Unconscious of the tie, Which binds them to their sympathising host, They are his Brothers! All in infancy, Offspring of different mothers, with like pride Press'd the same father's knee; in boyhood all Shared the same games, deeming the summer's day For their joint sports too short: and had not Vice, Jealous of One untainted by her wiles, Their holy bond dissolved, all still had slept Beneath the same dear roof. But Benjamin With double force encircled Joseph's heart. Fruit of a common womb, from Rachel both Quaff'd the rich stream of life. Revenge, alas! And Envy, hellish fiends, with mildewing breath Nipp'd in their elder-born the tender shoots Of love fraternal. To a roving band, Of crimes divulged, Gen. xxxvii. 2. caresses scant bestow'd Resentful, favour'd Joseph they consign'd. To Egypt borne, strange fortunes he endured, Storm and alternate sunshine—sunshine still Within his breast, while all without was gloom! A salve; a cherish'd steward, to his charge Spite of temptation trusty, though his faith Devoted him to bonds; not even in bonds Deserted of his God: of Pharaoh's throne Next raised the grace and guard, in golden car From his full garners, minister of fate, He scatters life. Egypt the hoarded grain Buys with her birth-right; and all-whelming Nile, When with his annual flood he floats the land, Washes no soil save Pharaoh's. The priests, indeed, retained theirs, Gen. xlvii. 22.: but this would, probably, bear only a small proportion to the whole of the layproperty surrendered to the King upon this occasion. Distant tribes Through many a clime Gen. xli. 57. at Joseph's bidding breathe, Droop if he doubts, and if he dooms expire. Their wonted wealth even Canaan's fields deny; Ib. xlii. 5. Canaan, hereafter with the bee's rich toil Ambrosial and the nectar'd vine ordain'd To gladden Israel. Memphis in the throng Of supplicants importunate beholds The Patriarch Ten, his right-hand's son alone Ib. xxxv. 18. Left to console their solitary sire. By Joseph recognised, himself unknown (For twenty summers with embrowning suns Had changed his hue, and dignity's stiff garb Cumber'd his form, while tones of mimic wrath His yearning heart belied) with sifting tongue Their story he elicits; and demands, Price of his future bounty, Benjamin Companion of their mission. Conscience now, Oft sleeping long, but ever sure to wake, Stirs in their bosoms. Joseph's anguish'd cries Entreating mercy, as with shrinking glance He eyed the pilgrim-traders, thrill their ears With pangs unfelt before. But Vengeance just, Sternly retributive (so Conscience deems) Exacts their cherish'd brother. Hardly wrung From Jacob's arms—his Rachel's last remain, His age's child—with many a tender charge, And many a bribe to sooth the despot's heart, The blooming envoy joins their train; and hence, Loading the board the banquet's luxuries, The mantling goblet and the festal blaze. And lo! where joyous, with rich freight dismiss'd, Homeward the Hebrews haste; and much they talk Of Egypt, though not yet her Pyramids, This, however, is far from being ascertained; as both the period of their erection, and the object of it, are still involved in obscurity. Some, indeed, have regarded them as the result of the Israelitish bondage-labours. Even the date of the opening of the Great Pyramid is unknown. It is hoped, Lieut. Wilford may from Shanscrit records be enabled to elucidate these mysteries. Work of a royal artist, with their tops Sky-piercing fix'd the traveller's curious gaze: Much too of him their hospitable host, His questionings harsh, his liberal courtesies (Wondrous alike in both) with grateful warmth They converse hold.

This passage has been the cause of much perplexity. Bishop Wilson proposes a different punctuation, by omitting the point after ‘divineth,’ to take off from Joseph the imputation of using what he calls “unwarrantable practices.” Other Annotators explain, from Julius Serenus, the mode of Divination by the Cup in use among the Egyptians, Abyssinians, and Chaldeans, involving an appeal to diabolical agency; and quote from the celebrated Cornelius Agrippa his, “Erat olim apud Assyrios in magno pretio hydromantiæ species, Lecanomantia nuncupata, à pelvi aquæ plenâ, cui imponebantur aureæ et argenteæ laminæ et lapides pretiosi certis imaginibus, nominibus, et characteribus inscriptæ; ad quam etiam referri potest artificium, per quod plumbo aut cerâ liquefactis et in aquam projectis, rem quam scire cupimus manifestis exprimunt imaginum notis.” (De Occult. Philosoph. I. 57. fo. lxxiii. ed. 1533.) Bishop Patrick suggests two or three solutions, but they are none of them perfectly satisfactory. The original verb, in our version construed ‘to divine,’ admits much variety of interpretation. That Joseph, if our translation be correct, must at least have affected to practise augury, can scarcely be denied after reading his own speech in the fifteenth verse; and this Geddes excuses by suggesting, that ‘the Mosaic Law against divination was not yet promulgated.’ To Kennicott's rendering of v. 5, “Therefore he would certainly discover concerning it,” he strongly objects. See, also, Le Clerc in loc. stays their speed. As when the sun From Cancer pours his culminating blaze, And hill and vale in rich embroidery drest Drink the full radiance; if the Power of storm Spread his black wing across the gorgeous scene, Instant the landscape droops, and deeper gloom Sits on the lurid air: the Patriarchs thus, From their bright noon of joy precipitant, Sink to profoundest woe. And was it thine, All-lovely as thou seemest, Benjamin, Thine the foul deed? Requital infamous Of tenderness peculiar! But thy blush, Ingenuous boy, the slanderous charge repels. Thy sacred load thou knew'st not. Backward now, Mournful and slow, to Joseph's presence borne, With generous intercession Judah pleads The trembler's cause; the vehemence recounts, Which tore him from their parent's straining clasp, That parent's love and too-prophetic fears, By Want alone surmounted; last, himself (His brother's promised pledge) to servitude He proffers with more virtuous eagerness, Than others covet freedom. Farther suit Their judge endures not: Nature long constrain'd, With ecstasy too great to be suppress'd, Forces her way. From public gaze withdrawn, And all the pomp and garb of state thrown by, While tears and cries announce his labouring soul, He stands disclosed to the astonish'd train Joseph, of their relentless trafficking Erst victim. From his soft forgiving glance They shrink confounded; but his gentle tones Breathe love and peace—“I am your brother, He “Whom once ye sold to Egypt; but, be sure, “You I not therefore blame. Auspicious heaven “Guided the dread achievement; and through me “Treasured it's swelling harvests, to sustain “My father's house.

Bid him haste, “Himself and his (so sovereign Pharaoh wills) “To share at once, and double all my joys.” Thus saying, with th' unblemish'd culprit twined In close embrace, he melts in happy tears. Short sequel asks my tale. With sinking heart Faint, as distrustful of so high a bliss Luke xxiv. 41. (For love most doubts, what still it most desires) Jacob at length, by proof resistless won, Quits unrepining Hebron's flowery vales, And Egypt to her shepherd-denizens Cedes Goshen's verdant pastures. He beholds, Theme of a realm's unprostituted praise, His long-wept son, pursued where'er he moves By every eye, by every knee adored, And blest by every tongue; yet 'midst his weal, As 'mid his woes, unalter'd. He beholds: And streams of transport flood his aged cheeks. O Ye, by virtuous acts and favouring heaven Lifted above your hopes, whose fathers live To glory in their offspring, speak the bliss Such consciousness imparts! To be extoll'd, Whate'er your toils, by hosts of your compeers, And read your triumphs in a nation's eyes, Is noble recompence, which to disclaim (Were such the arduous sacrifice injoin'd) Scarce lies in man's frail nature. But a meed Still purer waits the good man at his home, Far from the clamorous crowd; when He, whose lip The infant spirit breathed, whose lessons urged, Whose life allured to virtue, clasps his boy Charged with a people's well-earn'd eulogies, And with his strong reflected radiance glows. Others less happy, of their sires bereft, Hold still their onward course, with frequent sigh Given to their prosperous orphanship; and think, As o'er the venerated dust they bend, How sweet it were if He, whose pious care Tended the flexile scion, hail'd perchance Enraptured the full promise of it's bloom, And by his morning and his evening prayer Drew on it's head the nurturing dews of spring, Could taste it's ripen'd fruit: yet deem it crime To call his liberated spirit back, To mark their joys; joys haply not unshared Even of blest souls, if bliss of mortal source May rise permitted, incense-like, to heaven. Rather the lore paternal, from the grave Borrowing a sacred charm, they meditate; To some weak brother fill the lost One's place, And trace the copy blazon'd in the skies. And we are brothers all, my countrymen, Co-heirs of Freedom, whose unceasing care Watch'd o'er our tender childhood. Hers we are, By every filial tie in her great cause— From him high-seated on the throne, to those Who guard it's base—bound to resist her foe; To lose whate'er of life is worth the grasp Equally destined, should or force or fraud To that fierce foe give entrance. Wider still Extends the Christian chain. That golden bond, What nation clasps it not! Britannia, long With gospel-harvests have thy valleys laugh'd, And largely hast thou reap'd the plenteous crop.

From her pure lip, As erst from Solomon's the Southern queen, Nations shall gather wisdom, for their wealth (Peruvia's gold, and far Golconda's gems) Rich barter: o'er th' emancipated globe— On Niger's banks, by Lena's frozen tide, Or where in infancy Missouri plays— Venial idolatry! barbarian hordes Shall bow them at the name of Englishman. By actions unbelied, our tongues shall boast A common derivation: through the earth, As the wide waters o'er the ocean-bed, The Holy Volume shall it's stores unfold, And one vast brotherhood embrace mankind. THE DEATH OF SAUL AND JONATHAN, A POEM; 1813. INSCRIBED TO THE HON. J. W. WARD. ??? ?? ?? ????? ???????? ???????. (Mosch.) Heard ye that solemn strain, the dirge of death, By valiant Jabesh 1 Sam. xxxi. 11, 12. breathed, as on he moves With all the mournful minstrelsy of grief; The flute's low-murmur'd note, the muffled drum, Deep-toned bassoon, and trumpet's clang between, Weeping his Saul departed—from that Saul How changed, who erst in battle's perilous van Strode foremost, and with arm resistless crush'd Whate'er opposed! But though from greatness fallen, And lodged in earth unblest, 1 Sam. xxxi. 13. he shall not lack Even from his hunted 1 Sam. xxvi. 20. foe high eulogy, Beseeming Heaven's Anointed. In that corse, With many a barbed shaft 1 Sam. xxxi. 3. unseemly gored (His myriad wrongs forgotten) Jesse's son Sees but his country's chief, his Michal's sire, His boyhood's bounteous patron. Keener pangs Thrill his firm frame, as near with blood besmear'd He marks thy bosom, gentle Jonathan, Whose last throb heaved for him! Thy long long years Of faith, which nor adversity's stern frown, Nor thy fierce father's envious threats could shake, Rush on his mind—And hark! his lyre he strikes Attuned to saddest cadence, while his lip Gives sobbing utterance to his generous woe! ‘How are the Mighty fall'n! The flower, Which scented Israel's royal bower, Has soil'd in vulgar dust it's head, And all it's bloom is vanished! ‘O not in Gath be told the tale; From Askelon's proud dames conceal The wretchedness 'tis ours to feel: Lest, borne upon the western gale, Philistia's shouts of triumph wound our ear, And with unhallow'd taunt insult the pious tear. ‘No dew upon thy mountains fall, Gilboa; on thy fields no shower Henceforth it's balmy treasure pour: For there, the bruised shield of Saul, The Mighty's shield, was vilely cast away; As though no sacred oil had blest his brow for sway. ‘Heroes of many a gallant deed, Not vainly wielded Saul his sword, Not vainly twang'd his son the cord; Theirs lion-force, theirs eagle-speed! And though nor speed nor force could ward their end, Lovely and loved in life, in death 'twas theirs to blend. ‘Daughters of Israel, him bewail, Who bade your limbs the scarlet fold; Your arms, your necks who wreathed with gold, And joy'd your glittering forms to hail! Scathed by the storm, the Mighty fills his urn: On thy high places scathed, thee, Jonathan, I mourn. ‘Thy voice was music to mine ear— Music, which heaviest thoughts beguiles— And sunbeams to mine eye thy smiles: Nor I to thee less fondly dear! Much as my soul has relish'd maiden's love, Thy tenderness arose their tenderest flights above. ‘How are the Mighty fall'n! The flower, Which scented Israel's royal bower, Has soil'd in vulgar dust it's head, And all it's bloom is vanished!’ Flow'd never from the elegiac shell Such tuneful grief: nor when the Dorian mourn'd His Bion lost, and wept that meanest herbs, The garden's lowly growth, should rise renew'd, While Man—the great, the valiant, and the wise— Sinks in unwaking sleep; nor when each flower, That sad embroidery wears, “our Milton cropp'd, “To strew the laureat hearse where Lycid lay;” Nor when his Parnell Albion's Homer wail'd, “Dear to the Muse in vain.” For theirs were lyres, Though sweet, of human fabric. David's eye O'er his friend's faded form dropp'd tears divine: The wreath he wove was twined with flowers from heaven. And long upon his memory dwelt that form, In it's first lustre. Oft as he review'd Those scenes (still best beloved) of early prime, When with light crook 'twas his from lion's paw, Brave boy! or bear's, in Bethlehem's solitudes To guard his father's flock; his Jonathan Stooping to lift him from the lowly vale Of shepherd-life, and seat him near the throne Fast by himself, in his own garment robed, Girt with his zone and with his quiver graced, 1 Sam. xviii. 4. Held his dim gaze and bathed his glowing cheek. Nor 'mid the splendors of his after-years, His wars of triumph, peaceful pageantries, Or even (to his frail heart by crime endear'd) His Bathsheba's caress, came o'er his soul Aught so sublimely sweet as those pure hours, When each unto his other dearer self Gave the entire possession of his breast. Pardon, dread Mourner, that my feeble touch Profanes the holy harp, which thou alone Might'st sweep unblamed. Beneath my theme opprest Like thee I feel, when for the giant-strife Cased in thy prince's mail. Yet must I dare Th' adventurous achievement: O be mine, As my weak fingers wander o'er it's strings, To catch some portion of thy hallowing fire. For such, while yet thou wast a rustic boy, Ere glad Judæa own'd thee for her lord, The sorcery of thy native woodnotes wild, That thou could'st charm to rest the busy fiends Which gnaw'd thy moody sovereign. From thy wires Issued such heavenly music, fell Despair Her iron gripe unclench'd; and gave him back, Again a king, to cheerfulness and power. With grateful rapture echo Gibeah's domes, And Michal's cheek is flush'd with filial joy. And did no other passion, royal maid, Deepen that pure carnation? In the effect, A father's face with wonted smiles relumed, Pass'd he who pour'd the strain medicinal, The blooming Cause, unmark'd? Did no fleet gleam, With added glow kindling thy countenance, No hurried pulse his wish'd arrival hail? Or rather, all unconscious of the lay, Hung not thy soul upon the Minstrel's lip? Did'st thou not note with more than daughter's zeal, Whilst o'er his harp he lean'd, his eye's keen glance, As in thy sire with intuition quick He watch'd the workings of his magic song? Nor was it only thine with love's rich store, Prized o'er all other price, to recompense The healing hymn; nor thine alone of those His valour saved, th' imperial house of Saul, To pay the stripling champion with thy heart, When from Goliath's slaughter he return'd Triumphant. With like ardor Jonathan, Though doom'd his orb from that bright star to meet Total eclipse, it's rising radiance scann'd, And proudly track'd it's glories through the skies. And hence each murky fog, each sanguine cloud Raised by his father's breath to quench it's blaze, Ceaseless he wept. To his pure clasp no bar, That of untitled stem the hero sprung, Whose virtues were patrician. Lurk'd his friend, Chased by a thankless prince, in Naioth's hold Or far Adullam's cave, 'mid Hareth's woods Or Keilah's traitor towers, 1 Sam. xviii. 12. or (safer there, Where none were to be served, and to betray!) In Ziph's unpeopled wastes? With foot untired In Naioth, or amid thy forest-depths, Hareth, or in Adullam's sheltering night, Ziph or ungrateful Keilah, Jonathan Anxious to rescue, as his sire to slay, Pursued the homeless wanderer: and could faith Beyond all Greek, all Roman fame have wrought Redemption for a fated line, his sons Had still sway'd Judah's sceptre, and the wilds Of Bethlehem ne'er had lost their shepherd-boy. But Heaven's resolves will have accomplishment; And often guilt, beyond itself avenged, On it's own innocent race drags ruin down. Messiah's great progenitor must wear Saul's forfeit diadem: and filial worth Sinks in the parent's wreck. The shatter'd trunk Lies in Gilboa's field, it's palmy crown Stripp'd by the storm; and there, untimely strew'd, It's verdant scions in their summer-pride Of the same tempest victims! But thy hour Retributive, disinterested Prince, Is come; and floods of bliss thy brief woes drown. Where Paradise it's lengthening glades extends Robed in eternal green, 'tis thine with him Thou loved'st on earth to stray; thy mortal cares Remember'd, if remember'd, but t' enhance Thy present transports; nor shall harsh behest Of cruel father e'er divide you more. And shall the bard his pausing lyre suspend, Nor give one strain to that which urged the whole, Dear Friendship? Most unworthy he to taste, Whose recreant tongue not owns, it's hallow'd joys! O ?, Nothing now forbids my filling up this blank with the dissyllable, Basil; and those, who are interested about me or my friendships, will have no difficulty in assigning to it the proper surname. thou alike in weal and woe Found trusty, might I utter unbetray'd The name, which springs to my impatient lip, How would I syllable it forth! But thou Hast that within thee (should this mystic verse E'er meet thy conscious vision) that, with throb Answering to mine, will recognise and seize Each veil'd allusion, as in fond disguise Cautious it shadows forth our early hours. A halo-glory crowns each blessed spot Visited by our steps in youth's sweet prime, And thither—for near thee are spread the scenes Refulgent—when the needful toils of life Relax their hold upon thee, turn thy feet In happy pilgrimage; and, “Here we stray'd (So commune with themselves thy tender thoughts) “Soon as the morning-sun you heathery brow “Smote with slant beam, while yet the pearly dew “Hung on each crimson bell; here pour'd uncheck'd “The soul's pure current, or of youthful loves “Conversing, or of Granta's amaranth bowers, “And many a studious friend with hooks of steel “Link'd to our common heart!” Those hours are fled; And far by fortune sunder'd we pursue, As various duty guides, our separate tracks, Cheer'd by rare interview.

Conclusion. “Let there be light!”—So spake th' Almighty Word, And streams of splendor gush'd around their Lord. Forth at that bidding, emulous to run His course of glory, sprang the giant Sun; And, as he chased the scattered rear of night, “Scattering the rear of darkness.” (Sacontalá, Act IV.) O'er the wide East diffused his earliest light. There while his infant beam on Ganges play'd, Or hung entranced o'er Agra's spicy glade, India, first cherish'd with his orient ray, Shone like a bride in brightest colours gay. Cradled on earth's soft lap, it's lowly bed, In blushing pride luxuriant Butea Pennant's ‘Outlines of Hindostan,’ II. 95. spread: Itself a grove, the banyan there was seen, Arch within arch, and “echoing walks between;” Par. Lost, IX. 1107. There Vegetation fix'd her choice abode, And one sweet garden all the region glow'd. When the world sunk into it's watry grave, India rose brilliant from the penal wave; Shook off her stains, and rich in nature's charms, Rush'd to the Sun's invigorating arms. Rear'd in her fields, and foster'd by her skies, The growth of mind attain'd it's loftiest size: There where the mango swell'd on every bough, And double harvests teem'd without the plough, Her happy race knew none save letter'd toil, And Arts and Science bless'd the genial soil. Ere Revelation flamed from Sinai's height, India rejoiced in patriarchal light. Tradition there preserved, from sire to son, That first great truth, that God is All and One; 'Till fabling bards the mystic song began, And learned darkness stole on wilder'd man. His rigid code then selfish Brahma framed, Then for his Caste it's proud distinction claim'd; Waved o'er the cheated realm his ebon wand, And scatter'd demon-meteors through the land. So born and fed 'mid Turan's mountain-snows, Pure as his source, awhile young Ganges flows; Through flowery meads his loitering way pursues, And quaffs with gentle lip the nectar'd dews; 'Till, swoln by many a tributary tide, His waters wash some tall pagoda's side: Then broad and rough, 'mid rocks unknown to day, Through tangled woods where tigers howl for prey, He foams along; and, rushing to the main, Drinks deep pollution from each tainted plain. Yet still kind Science, prodigal of good, Smiled on her dusky suitor as he woo'd. To him, while Europe's hordes lay whelm'd in shade, Her fullest charms the radiant power display'd: Show'd him the wonders of her secret lore, The plant's retiring virtues to explore; From midnight depths the sparkling gem to raise, And bid it on the brow of beauty blaze: Urged him afar to send his ranging eye 'Mid the bright orbs, that gild the peopled sky; To trace the self-poised planets, as they run In endless circle round their central sun: See whirling earth, with two-fold impulse driven, Wheel through the vast obliquity of heaven; While day and night, and all the changeful year, Turn as she turns and hang on her career: Taught him, with useful fiction, to portray The glittering monsters of th' ecliptic way: Th' innumerous host of stars to group and name, That pour on worlds unseen their solar flame; Orion's might which sways the southern seas, Arcturus, and the cluster'd Pleiades: The knowledge of physics (particularly astronomy) by which the old Hindus were distinguished, as well as their metaphysical, ethical, and poetical fame, are briefly stated by Robertson, with his accustomed elegance, in the Appendix to his ‘Historical Disquisition concerning Ancient India;’ and more at large by Craufurd, in his ‘Sketches’ of that ingenious people. Taught him with subtiler skill, and better art, To pierce the close recesses of the heart; Hold moral beauty to man's raptured sight, Guide him from passion's glare to reason's light; And prompt him, to himself severely true, His high descent to prove, his glorious end pursue. Nor only Science led her Indian youth With patient labour to the throne of truth, Studious by just gradation to refine From brute to human, human to divine: But Fancy rapt him on her wing of fire To realms sublime, where bliss outruns desire; Where streams of crystal feed ambrosial flowers, And Love and Glory speed the laughing hours: There to his hand resign'd her powers of sway, Her lyre, and liquid voice, and numerous lay; Gave him her holy hymn, her lofty ode, To sing the chieftain or to sound the God: Gave him her stately epic, to rehearse His Arjun's The Bhágvat Geeta, or ‘Dialogues of Krishna and Arjun,’ an extract from the Mahabharat (the great epic poem of India, written, if we may trust the chronology of the Brahmins, within a century after the deluge) was translated by Mr. Wilkins from the original Sanscrit in 1785. It contains all the grand mysteries of the Brahminical faith. fame with all the pomp of verse; When Krishna, mounted on the hero's car, Bore him secure amid the clanging war: Gave him her drama's tearful vase, to pour O'er virtue's sacred anguish pity's shower; When soft Sacontalá See Sir William Jones' elegant version of Calidasa's drama, ‘The Fatal Ring.’ It's author, the Shakspeare of India, was the brightest of the Nine Gems, who adorned the court of Vicramáditya in the century immediately preceding the birth of Christ. in Canna's grove Press'd the fond pledge of her Dushmanta's love, Or as her steps yet linger'd on the green (Of all her infant sports the happy scene) Wept o'er each flower, her garden's blameless pride. Kiss'd the young fawn that sorrow'd by her side; And still, to ease her bosom's bursting swell, To flower and fawn prolong'd the sad farewell. And did oblivion quench this hallow'd fire? May Genius like the brood of earth expire? With meteor-front a few short moments soar, Then sink forgotten, and be seen no more? Ah! no: by age undimm'd his cheek appears; His laurell'd brow defies th' assault of years. 'Twas Mecca's star, whose orb malignant shed It's baleful ray o'er India's distant head. Fleet from the stormy west, on steed of flame, To blast her bloom the Bactrian Mahmoud of Ghizni; who, after desolating India by twelve successive irruptions (the first, A. D. 1002), under the pretence of converting it's inhabitants to the true faith, founded a dynasty which lasted about 150 years. archer came: Beside him rode, twin ministers of fate, The Lust of Empire and Religious Hate; And still, where'er their sanguine banners flew, Spring's rosy splendors vanish'd from the view. Her last faint throb of struggling life to crush, See from the north remorseless Timur rush! His drear morasses, and his boisterous sky, The fire-eyed This was the peculiar feature of Tamerlane. “His eyes (say the historians) appeared full of fire.” Krishen and the nine Gopia, mentioned below, are the obvious prototypes of the Grecian Apollo and his Muses. Tartar quits without a sigh: Calls his grim squadrons from their realms of snow, And leads where zenith suns strange lustre throw: By Bember's foot, who dreary, black, and bold Stands the stern guard of Cashmere's vale of gold; Through bowery Matra, where the Gopia nine In love's disport with youthful Krishen join. There while the mango from it's stem they tear, Or light with saffron-wreaths The saffron-flowers of the Michelia are used by the Indian ladies, to relieve the jetty blackness of their hair. (Pennant, ib.) their raven hair, O'er India's plains the myriad swarms expand, And Science, Genius, Fancy fly the land. So, 'mid th' effulgence of her ardent skies, In the broad noon a spot is seen to rise, Dread Typhon's cradle! O'er th' horizon's space The monster spreads, till heaven scarce yields him place; Then pours his fury, and with vengeful sweep Bears houses, herds, and harvests to the deep: Before the fiend the groves of Eden bloom, Behind him scowls a desert and a tomb. “The land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness.” (Joel ii. 3.) Thus India, bright in fortune's favouring hour, Bewail'd the ravage of invading power. Witness imperial Delhi's When Tamerlane caused it to be destroyed, A. D. 1397, upon the pretext of an insult offered to his troops, after the horrid ceremony of ‘the Joar.’ fatal day, When bleeding Rajahs choked proud Jumna's way: Witness, Benares, thy neglected towers, Where Wisdom mused in academic bowers; Their quadrant-curves For a particular account of the celebrated Observatory at this place, see a Letter from Sir Robert Barker to the President of the Royal Society of London, read May 29, 1777. where learned walls display'd, And gnomon-pillars threw their length of shade: Witness the voice suppress'd, the silent shell, Which erst in lovely strife were wont to swell: Witness (ah! heaviest curse) the night of mind, To Superstition's ghastly brood resign'd. Now all her veins the lethargy invades; Mute are her schools, and hush'd her warbling shades. No more the Muse exulting Fancy fires, Prompts the high thought, the lofty strain inspires: Memory no more to the degenerate line Points, where their country's ancient glories shine; On Youth's pure cheek bids generous passion glow, Or lifts his arm to lay th' oppressor low. Ah, wretched land! to every ill a prey; Thy sons enslaved, thy cities in decay! But light the chains, the abject frame that bind, To those which bow to earth th' aspiring mind. Where once th' Hindu his simple prayer preferr'd, And sweet his caroll'd hymn of praise was heard; His turf-built altar unembrued with blood, His gentle heart's religion, to do good; There in her gory shrine, with outstretch'd hands, Her human food stern Calica The blood-thirst of this black goddess (the wife of Shiva, and the counterpart of the Tauric Diana or Hecate) is allayed in proportion to the dignity of her victim. After an offering of fish or tortoise, it soon recurs: by the sarabha it is quenched for twenty five, and by the tiger for a hundred years: but man is her favourite sacrifice, and his blood is effectual for a complete chiliad. This latter oblation however, as Sir William Jones informs us, is now forbidden. demands: There his huge car the monster-god Jagrenaut. The car of this deity is four stories high, and moves upon sixteen wheels; beneath which, numbers of his deluded votaries annually throw themselves to be crushed to death, as a sure passport to immortal happiness. impels O'er prostrate crowds, who court the crushing wheels: There, from her babes by savage Brahmins borne, The widow'd mother clasps her consort's urn; With ill-feign'd triumph mounts his blazing pyre, And sinks, proud trembler! in the sacred fire. This custom still prevails in the Mahratta empire, and in the dominions of the ancient Rajahs, particularly among families of distinction. By the English it has been uniformly opposed. These, Superstition's execrable train, Throng the vex'd soul where darkness holds her reign. Thus, Elephanta, For a description of this stupendous subterranean temple consult Thevenot, Anquetil, Robertson, Pennant, &amp;c. but, especially, Niebuhr. through thy cavern'd halls Portentous sculptures frown along the walls: With snaky wreaths, in strong projection bold, Clasp the wide arch, the massive shaft enfold; And, as amid the gloom their forms dilate, In the chill'd breast mysterious awe create. When India saw Medina's crescent fail, And the mild flame of Zion's star prevail, Well might she hope the beam, which once had glow'd To guide her sages Matt. ii. 2. to the God's abode, Would now, bright harbinger of peace! dispense On her faint head it's healing influence. But, ah! it rose in clouds. With sanguine glare Ambition's comet fired the sickening air: And, black exhaling from the putrid ground, The mists of avarice heaven's blest radiance drown'd; Breathed thick infection o'er the dawning day, And quench'd the lustre of th' eternal ray. 'Tis past. Too long Oppression's tyrant-race Have ground her children with their iron mace! Too long has Silence heard her whisper'd fears, And glens impervious drank her flowing tears! 'Tis past. Her bosom stung with conscious shame, Awaken'd Albion re-asserts her fame; Inclines in pity to a groaning land, Wrests the foul sceptre from the spoiler's hand; And, greatly lavish in the glorious cause, Grants with her Jones Sir William. Of this extraordinary man—extraordinary in respect of talents, attainments, and virtues, singly perhaps unequalled, but assuredly never before so united, Mr. Gibbon (in cases of simple literature, no mean commender) pronounced, that “he was equally familiar with the Year-Books of Westminster, the Commentaries of Ulpian, the Attic Pleadings of Isæus, and the Sentences of Arabian and Persian Cadhis.” From such a quarter, we do not look for any panegyric upon his conscientious investigation and acceptance of Christianity. her science and her laws— Her Jones, high-gifted to fulfil her plan; The friend of learning, freedom, truth, and man. His were the stores of letter'd time, comprest The mind of ages in a single breast; The glance to catch, the patience to inquire, The sage's temper and the poet's fire. In him the wealth of Greece and Latium shone, Their Themis, Clio, Erato his own; And his, reveal'd in all their dazzling hues, The luscious charms of Asia's florid Muse: With her o'er Schiraz' roseate plain he roved, Where Hafiz revell'd and where Sadi loved; On Rocnabad's green marge delighted stray'd, Heard her soft lute The lutanist Mirza Mahomed, from his sweetness called Bulbul, ‘the Nightingale,’ is recorded to have excited the emulation of his namesake birds, in a grove near Schiraz. (Pennant, ib. 261.) Sir W. J. had the story from one, who was himself witness to the circumstance. in Mosellay's sweet shade: Then pierced the mazy depths of Sanscrit lore, While Brahmins own'd a light unseen before; Bow'd to their master-pupil, and confest With humbled brow the genius of the West. “At a public durbar, a few days after his death, the Pundits could neither restrain their tears for his loss, nor find terms to express their admiration at the wonderful progress he had made in the sciences which they professed.” (Lord Teignmouth's ‘Life of Sir William Jones.’) But nobler cares are his: for human kind He plies his restless energies of mind. Strung by that orb, beneath whose flaming ray Inferior natures crumble to decay, With growing speed he presses to the goal, And his fleet axles kindle as they roll. 'Twas his to bid admiring India see, In Law, In 1794, Sir William Jones published his translation of ‘The Ordinances of Menu,’ comprising the Indian system of religious and civil duties. In the lines beginning ‘Law, which in heaven, &amp;c.’ the reader will recognise a feeble imitation of the following sublime period of Hooker, which closes the first book of his ‘Ecclesiastical Polity:’ “Of Law there can be no less acknowledged, than that her seat is the bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the world. All things in heaven and earth do her homage, the very least as feeling her care, and the greatest as not exempted from her power: both angels, and men, and creatures of what condition soever, though each in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent, admiring her as the mother of their peace and joy.” pure reason's ripen'd progeny: Law, which in heaven and earth holds sovereign sway; Whose rule the bad endure, the good obey; Whose giant grasp o'er whirling spheres extends, Whose tender hand the insect-speck befriends; Her voice of quiring worlds th' harmonious mode, And her high throne the bosom of her God. Ah! short the blessing: of ethereal fire One vivid burst, to lighten and expire! In vain the Christian crown'd the learned name, And boundless knowledge form'd his meaner fame! He falls, bewail'd from where Hydaspes laves His sands of gold, to Thames' distant waves: Isis and Ganges weep their sage's doom, And mingle sorrows o'er his early tomb. O stay your griefs, sad streams! On length of years Rests not the age, which ruthless Time reveres. Ripe to his grave unspotted Youth descends, Though to his cheek the rose it's radiance lends; And hoary Folly ranks in childhood's train, Taught to be wise by rolling suns in vain. Wisd. iv. 8, 9. Nor all extinct he dies. From earth's low climes, By frailties sullied or obscured by crimes, To his own heaven resumed, o'er Asia's night Still shall he shed his tutelary light; Still kindred worth with rival zeal inspire, And pour from Wellesley's urn transmitted fire. Wellesley, his Eton's boast, his Oxford's pride, Loved by each Muse, to every Grace allied; Though yet unsheath'd his blazing faulchion waves, And yet fresh millions he subdues and saves; His eye's soft beam still throws on Learning's groves, And fosters while he guards the arts he loves. E'en now on Hugli's banks the pile he rears, Forms with his mind, and with his presence cheers; In gorgeous state the glittering turrets rise, And brighter dawn illumes the Eastern skies.

(name to learning dear) Train the fair promise of the opening year: From Granta's mart convey th' exhaustless store, Her schools' ingenuous strife, her classic lore; All that her Newton, all her Bentley taught, Her Barrow's eloquence, her Bacon's thought; The precious cargo bear to India's strand, And a new Granta decks the happy land. Granta! the name wakes memory's softest tear: O to my heart beyond all rival dear! Dream of my night, and vision of my day, Accept the homage of this grateful lay. That I have friends, my throbbing bosom's pride, That love for me his fillet threw aside; That round my hearth his tenderest pledges shine, That home and peace and competence are mine— To thee, next heaven, I owe: and should the strain, Which now I raise, thy favouring plaudit gain; Thou gavest the lyre from which the music springs, Thou gavest the art to sweep it's sounding strings. Return, my Muse: for lo! where o'er the main Returning Science eastward leads her train— Law, nurse and guardian of each useful art; Honour, pure sovereign of the noble heart; Blithe Industry, who whistles at his plough; And Freedom, choicest gift her hands bestow. Loud o'er the champaign bursts the ryut's song, And rustic echoes the glad note prolong; As o'er his rice-field's floating verdure thrown, His gay parterres and woodland's podded down, Rice, opium, and cotton supply the chief employment and support to the peasantry of Hindostan. Hodges represents the manufacturer as setting up his light loom every morning in the cool shade, and taking it home with him in the evening. His eye ascends to heaven with glistening gleam, Joy tunes his tongue, and Albion is his theme: Albion, who now each selfish care resign'd, And all her glories flashing on her mind, Now that the foe high lifts his blood-stain'd brand, And law and freedom hang upon her hand, Rides proudly buoyant o'er her own blue wave, And what she bled to win would die to save. Beneath th' o'er-arching banyan's hallow'd gloom, The swarthy artist plies his dexterous loom. Light through it's filmy maze the shuttle springs, Nor deigns to touch the gossamery strings: The slender form vests more than Coan “?Cois tibi penè videre est, Ut nudam.”(Hor. Sat. I. ii. 101.) grace, And half seduce the eye from beauty's face. The glance of Science now fresh cares demand, And wants and woes entreat her soothing hand. With patient toil on each new scene she pores, Each lonely dell, each tangled brake explores: Dauntless the death-snake's This most fatal reptile (the Cobra de morte) is said, perhaps fancifully, to bear upon it's head the marks of a scull and two crossbones. (Pennant, ib.) dreary haunt invades, Led by her own effulgence through the shades: Then, where with hues unprofitably gay Superba reddens in the blaze of day, Her subtilest spell bids Chemia there apply, From the deep fibre wring it's hoarded dye; O'er the fine web the blushing tincture shed, And gird with richer wreaths her India's head. Where long it lurk'd, withdrawn from day's fierce glare, Bids Medicine thence the wholesome simple bear; From the coy root extort it's liquid health, And bribe stern death with vegetable wealth. On Delhi's plain, or where by Agra's towers His foaming urn cœrulean Jumna pours, (As erst on Sunium's point) some Plato stands, With virtue's magic charms th' ingenuous bands; Points to the fair, and good, and brave, and free, And bids them view, and emulate, and be: Through each young vein the tingling ardor glows, And all Ilissus into Ganges flows. Her too the social charities attend; The foe she softens, and endears the friend. —What wretch art thou, those desert wilds among, Whose fearful footsteps shun the human throng? Who fliest to forests, exiled from thy kind, And all thy youth's best transports left behind? Ah! by those streaming tears I know thee now, And the despair that sits upon thy brow, Devoted Paria! Of the dreadful exclusion of these unhappy beings from society, a striking exemplification is given by St. Pierre, in his ‘Chaumière Indienne.’ Their very shadow, in the estimation of the purer Hindu, literally pollutes what it passes over; and, if they happen to touch one of the Nayrs, or old nobles of Malabar (of the Khatre caste) they are not unfrequently cut down by his sword. outcast of thy race, Thrown shivering from thy fellows' fond embrace: Like a blue plague-spot, hapless thing! abhorr'd; Thy touch pollution, and thy doom the sword! Yet thee, even thee, shall heavenly Science greet, Pierce with her sun-bright beams thy dark retreat; Restore the blameless joys that once were thine, And close without a cloud thy late decline. Yes: thou again the bosom's glow shalt prove, The hand of friendship and the lip of love; Thee shall the village-cot protect from harms, And Brahmins clasp thee with fraternal arms. Nor these th' illusions of poetic land, Whose airy splendors mock the grasping hand. Where Bhâgulpour uplifts her front sublime, See to her topmost summits Cleveland “Is genus indocile ac dispersum montibus altis Composuit, legesque dedit.” This gentleman, who died in 1783, civilised the savages of his district chiefly by trusting himself among them unarmed, stating his benevolent purpose, and making occasional presents to their wives and children. (Hodges, and Penn. ib.) climb; Call from their craggy dens her savage swarm, With learning polish, with affection warm; Bid through their souls the flame ethereal thrill, And mould their melting natures to his will. Her tints Contentment to the scene applies, And the waste desert blooms a paradise. But chief Religion, venerable maid, Raptured repairs where first her footsteps stray'd, When down to earth she came, an angel guest; And man, yet pure, her genial presence blest. On Guilt's dark brow her glittering cross appears, His sullied cheek is wash'd with pious tears; And Ganges, hallow'd still for holier ends, Death-stream no more, It is one of the objects of Hindu superstition, to be carried (if possible) when expiring, to the banks of the Ganges. his wave baptismal lends. E'en now from yonder strand I see them move, The mild evangelists of peace and love. Unstain'd with Afric's blood, they bend their prows Where in his fiery belt Dahomey glows; Hoist round the stormy Cape their straining sail, From Yemen's mountains woo the fragrant gale, And bear (strange merchandise!) to Asia's shore The Gospel's bright imperishable ore: Unsold to deal it's unbought wealth, “Freely ye have received, freely give.” (Matt. x. 8.) their plan; Their traffic, to redeem the soul of man. To check their eager march, Tibetian snows And Caggar's sands their trackless wilds oppose: Onward they press at Duty's sacred call, South, North, o'er Decan's ghauts and China's wall; Stretch uncontroll'd their Saviour's gentle reign, And art and nature bar their way in vain. On mosques where late the lurid crescent shone, Pagodas rear'd to shrine an idol-stone, Seringham's walls spread many an acre o'er, And the proud domes of gorgeous Gazipour For a description of this immense pagoda, see Craufurd's ‘Sketches,’ I. 108, note. The mosque of Gazipour is the pride of Mahometan religious architecture. Her banner'd cross victorious Albion waves, Beneath that symbol strikes, beneath that symbol saves. O beauteous Queen! O dear-loved Mother-Isle! Thine is each gallant aim, each generous toil. For thee, while Fame her wreath of amaranth twines, And with her palm thy native oak combines, The succour'd orphan lisps his little prayer, And the slave's shackles crumble in thine air. With what delight thy winding shores I tread, Catch thy white sails by busy Commerce spread, With labouring gaze ascend thy rocky steeps, Or hear thy thunder bellowing o'er the deeps— Heaven knows: and, hung th' event on vow of mine, Thy cloudless sun should never know decline. Hold then thy high career: while France essays With poor intrigue to crop thy well-won bays, And mask'd in traffic's or religion's robe, Merchant or preacher, traverses the globe; To shake thee, proof in Europe to alarms, On Asia's plains with Holkar's faithless arms: Pursue thy glorious course. Be this thy art, Not to corrupt, but meliorate the heart: Where'er mankind in gentile darkness lie, Instruction's blessed radiance to supply; O'er the oppress'd soft mercy's dews to shed, And crush with ruin the oppressor's head. O haste your tardy coming, days of gold, Long by prophetic minstrelsy foretold! Where yon bright purple streaks the orient skies, Rise Science, Freedom, Peace, Religion rise: 'Till, from Tanjore to farthest Samarcand, In one wide lustre bask the glowing land; And (Brahma from his guilty greatness hurl'd With Mecca's Lord) Messiah rule the world! LAURA. When Laura first, with heavenly radiance bright, Beam'd in full lustre on my ravish'd sight, Ere yet the wonder spake, I saw and loved— What marble by such beauty were not moved! But when, in tones as music soft and clear, With nature's melody she charm'd mine ear, Her tongue confirm'd the triumph of her eyes; Who sees is wounded, but who listens dies. TRAFALGAR. ???????? ????????. (Hom.) ?animamque in vulnere ponit. (Virg.) Hark to yon shout, that rends the sky! Hark to yon bosom-rending groan! The pæan that of victory, And this the knell of Nelson gone! Ring, ring the merry peal of joy; Breathe, breathe the solemn note of woe: Let transport now the heart employ, Now let the tear for Nelson flow. In gallant trim the Spaniard rush'd, The light Gaul buoyant by his side: —O'er them the ocean-wave has gush'd; They sleep beneath the wintry tide. TRAFALGAR, cherish'd bitter name, Shall still to our remembrance rise; Scene of our proudest costliest fame— Where France is crush'd, and Nelson dies! Still in the van of victory Shall England's flag o'er ocean sweep; And still from every seaman's eye Shall Nelson's trophies banish sleep. Ring, ring, &amp;c.

When Rome was yet in ancient virtue great, Ere tyrant Cæsars had unnerved the state; Proud of her toilette's wealth, a modish Fair The costly hoard to famed Cornelia bare: And, having press'd it on her cold survey, With conscious triumph claim'd a like display. Soon as from school her boys, the Gracchi, came; “Behold my jewels (cried the happy Dame): “These are the gems a mother most should prize, “These glitter brightest to maternal eyes.” Her inmost soul confounded at the view, The self-admonish'd visitant withdrew. Such were the matrons virtuous Rome admired: From such sprang patriots who, by toils untired, Even to the last despotic sway defied; And, vanquish'd in the noble conflict—died. One such I could, but may not name (for she, Blind to herself, would deem it flattery) One who, Cornelia-like, each hour employs, Sweet labour! 'mid the sphere of filial joys; To courtiers leaves exhausted India's store, And rich in living diamonds asks no more. IMPROMPTU: Spoken between the third and fourth Acts of Mrs. Cowley's Tragedy, entitled, ‘The Fall of Sparta.’ So great thy art—that, while we view'd Of Sparta's sons the lot severe, We caught the Spartan fortitude, And saw their woes—without a tear. LINES Addressed to Lady Miller, on the Urn at Bath-Easton. Miller, the Urn in ancient times ('tis said) Held the collected ashes of the dead: So thine, the wonder of these modern days, Stands open night and day for lifeless lays. Leave not unfinish'd then the well-form'd plan, Complete the work thy classic taste began; And oh! in future, ere thou dost inurn 'em, Remember first to raise a pile—and burn 'em. PROLOGUE ON GENERAL WOLFE. TRANSLATION. When great and little felt the common blow, And mingled sorrows o'er Æmilius low, While funeral games the hero gone record, Rome her lost favourite with these scenes deplored: And who to-night shall view them re-appear, Nor to our hero give as true a tear? Though fann'd by Conquest's wing our banners stream, Where Phœbus darts his earliest, latest beam; Even 'midst our very torrent triumphs springs Some bitter tear, some lawful sorrowings. If aught of fair contains the thirst of fame, If genius, faith immutably the same, If arduous laurels, and in youth's sweet prime Valour and virtue cropt before their time— If aught of fair in these, or lovely be, That fair, that lovely, Wolfe, belongs to thee! Nor diest thou all: for aye the wreath shall bloom, Which weeping Britain hangs upon thy tomb: The massive marble royal hands shall rear, Destined thy glory's deathless tale to bear: Thither in crowds shall England's heroes flow, And from thy ashes catch a kindred glow; While, as they read in victory's lap thy fall, “Be such,” they cry, “our course—be such its goal.” FINIS.</field>
