      <field name="fulltext">To the most Noble and Illustrious Lady, both for Nobility and Piety, as of Vertue a rare and peerlesse example, Lady Anne Kare, Countesse of Ancram. The Lizards eyes the face of man amazeth, Looking on which the more and more it gazeth: When I your heaven infused graces view, Madam, my sense amazed stares on You. Heaven tempers so its gifts in You alone, As that all graces seeme combin'd in one; When I do homage to Nobility, Straight on it doth reflect Your piety; So earthly glory and that of heav'n begun Makes You a glorious object like the Sunne, Which darreth forth so many rayes of light, As that they dazle this my scantling fight. In You great Iunos stately majestie Is fraught with Christian love and charity; You have what vertues learn'd Minerva hath, And for her Ã¦gis, you are arm'd with faith: What's Venus beautie to Your sacred face, Which is the Physiognomie of grace? If for the golden apple there should be A strife amongst the goddesses; To thee Let Paris give it, so he surely shall Please all the three, Your selfe being more than all. Your Honours humble, and most devoted to serve you, Robert Farlie. To his friend the Author. I need not praise thy Booke: No more to tell, Then that it Pictures hath, will make it sell: Bookes gaudy, like themselves most do now buy, Fine, trim, adorned Bookes, where they may spy More of the Carvers than th' Authors skill, And more admire the Pencill, than the Quill: Pamphlets, whose Outsides promise, they may finde What may their Eyes feede, rather than their minde: Nay now adayes who almost doth behold, One booke without a gaudy Liv'ry sold: E'ne Poetry it selfe is at a stay, For all it's Feet, if Carvers mak't not gay. But as for this thy Worke (my Friend) Divine, Which no pen worthily can praise, but thine. It wants no Sculptill Art, to set it forth, Twill fast enough away, with its owne worth, Tis hard to say, whether the Muses traine, Or else the Graces, most in thee doe raigne. Thy Pen was well employ'd: bring it to sight, Thy Phansie's Waighty, though thy subject's Light. Who, that thee knowes not, ever would surmise, That out of Scotia such Light should arise? Goe forward, and the Muses so thee love That thou a second Buchanan maist proove. How subtile is thy stile! in holy Writ How vers'd thou art! How fluent is thy wit! About the Virgins Lamps, while thou dost toyle, I'le say, thou hast not lost labour and oyle. Fame shall here light her Torch, and thy name blaze To after ages, which no time shall raze: Thy Candle shall outshine the Sunne; it's rayes Shall not obscure their Light, nor yet thy praise. The purblind judgement of the Criticke rout Shall never this extinguish without doubt; To snuffe it with their censures them allow, Twill brighter shine, they shall not it out blow: Iohn Hooper. To the Author. Heroes bright lampe, which she on Sestus strand, Set up to be a marke, by which might land Her lov'd Leander, when he crost the Sea Of Hellespont; long since was out, and we Onely enjoy its fame, the light is gone, And tow'r is buried in oblivion. Th' Ãgyptian Pharos, which was fam'd to be The worlds seav'nth wonder, in obscurity Lyes ruin'd, and that multiplicit light, Once to the Marriners a Sunne by night, Is now extinct; for tis decreed by fate, What Art doth reare, that Time shall ruinate: Nay holy Writ assures, at the last day The starres shall fall from heaven, the sunne decay, The Moone be turnd to blood, those which God made First most resplendent lights, at last shall fade. But thy Lights most transcendent, can hand Of Time or Fate (which all things else hath scand,) Put to these Lights an end, for these shall be Bright shining Tapers to Eternity. Christopher Drayton. To the Author. That I may tell the world how I admire Thy well-pend Flames; one sparke of that fire, Which warmes thy learned brest, bestow on mee, I, then a Poet, would dare speake of thee. If I should write thy praise when I have done I hold a Candle to the flaming Sunne I thinke thy towring Muse a Starre hath reach'd; Or else a Beame from bright Apollo fetch'd To light each Taper by; for their pure flame Doth well assure us, it from Heaven came. William Povey. To the Ingenious Author, on his Latin and English Morall Emblems. Two Lights within two severall Spheares were hurld, In the divided Chaos of the World, When like an Embryo this whole Masse of Clay, Before the Fiat, yet imperfect lay. And being brought to birth, by him whose power Hath all Eternity; and yet no how'r: The day was subject to the Nobler light, And to the lesser did obey the Night. So in this Midwifery of wit, by Thee Delivered, two lights, two Subjects be. Thy nobler Roman stile to day-borne men Children of Arts, directs thy Latin pen. And that the duller ignorant might see, They have a Mother-Moone begot by Thee: Thine as Gods creatures serve to leade the way To him that gave a night, succeeding Day. Tho. Beedome Britaines Great Lights. Persia thy Eternall fire is come to nought, The Vestals flame is spent, more than Rome thought. Both fires are gone with Empires: Heav'n above Gives light and power to them, who Heav'n doe love. Unto our Land two Lights are now transfer'd; The Persians Sunne, Romes Vesta are interr'd. Oxonia. Great Oxford, Thine the Bible e're hath beene; For firmely standing Vesta it is seene, Hence threefold Crowne, Thou hast deserv'd by right; That's not of Gold, but of Empyrean Light. Cantabrigia. My right hand holds the Sunne, my left doth show The Cup, from which true light and Nectar flow; These cherish so the Palmes of Victory, That they are trophees of Eternity. To the Reader. Since Courteous Reader, this our course is one, Well overtaken, you shall not passe alone: You saile this sea of life, and so doe I; Unto the Haven of Heaven we both doe hye; But harke you, least in darkenesse we doe stray, Here be some Lights for to direct our way: Torches and Candles, and if the wind doe blow, Here with a Lanterne safely we may goe; Make use of these, untill you come to shore, Where we shall have Heavens Light for evermore. Robert Farlie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Morall Emblems. 1. [My light from whence it came, mounts stil on high] My light from whence it came, mounts stil on high Vnto the source of light that's never dry. Like as the Rivers to the Ocean runne, From whence their secret fountaines first begun; Like as the stone doth to the center sway; To the Spheres my light still makes his way. No joyes, delights, and greatest weights of gold, Or pampering pleasure fast our soule can hold. The panting soule rests not, untill it see Is maker God, a Tri-une Deitie. 2. [And loth'st thou me, my Soule, loving to goe] And loth'st thou me, my Soule, loving to goe Elsewhere, I pray thee whither, let me know, Was thou not all this while my deerest mate, My guest, my convoy, consort in estate; While I did florish, thou didst constant prove, My times are darkned now, so is thy love? Here as a captive to a keeper, so I tyed was with thee, at list, to goe, Banisht from home: loe now my bonds are loose, Thou dy'st, I glad runne to my fathers house. Soules bond with body hardly maketh breach Yet this doth dye, and that Heav'ns dwelling reach. 3. [Sometimes I was the brood of Gold'n-haird sunne] Sometimes I was the brood of Gold'n-haird sunne, More pure, more chast, than Vesta's watchfull nunne, Purer than Easterne gemmes, than Saphirs bright, Purer than Ophirs gold, than Rubies light, Purer than Pactols gravell often try'd In fire, and furnace seven times purify'd: But since the fates to grease did me combine, His filthy dregges are judged to be mine: For why conjunction doth contagion make, And from th'impure the pure infection take. The soule once plung'd into the body darke, Forgets it was a chast and divine sparke. 4. [One candle dispels the darkenesse of the night] One candle dispels the darkenesse of the night, And many doe resemble PhÅbus light: One Sunne illight us the round globe every where, What way th'horizon bounds the hemisphere: If you ten thousand thousand Sunnes should see At once, O what a day light would that be! When Christ amidst the clouds our doome shall plead, When Earth and Sea shall render up their dead Saints more then starres at once shall mount on hye. As glorious Sunnes, to meete Christ in the skye. That day shall drive away the darkenesse so, That after that, no day shall darkenesse know. 5. [Whose purchase was his pouch, his house a tun] Whose purchase was his pouch, his house a tun, Criticke of actions whatsoever done, That learned dogge, at noone-tyde tinn'd his light, Searching for one, whose actions were upright. The Eagles young ones by the Sunne are try'd, Mens actions by the lamp are best espy'd; For men in day time maskt with vizards goe Of truth and faith making an outward show. But when they can nights secret silence find, Before the lamp they doe unmaske their mind. Happy is he whom Sunne and Lamp sees one, Who's honest still, though witnesse there be none. 6. [Titans day burning lamp is set on high] Titans day burning lamp is set on high, The more to light'n the Earth from saphir sky; His beames more glorious and conspicuous shine From East to West, from South to midnight line: My light you must not under bushell put, Nor in a chinky corners prison shut; That lights may cleare the chambers all throughout, They must aloft be hanged round about. You holy Priests, to whom the word of light Is trust, advance your torches in the sight Of mortals, shew them who in darkenesse dwell, The narrow way that leads to Heaven, from Hell. 7. [If thus my light nights sable silence glads] If thus my light nights sable silence glads, Making a cheerefull roome in midnight shads, If Gold'n-like PhÅbus and his silver sister, He in the day, shee in the night doth glister; What thought-surpassing light then shall that be, When we in Heaven Empyrean God shall see? Sooner thou canst the world hold in thy hand, Or in a shell containe the glassie strand; Than tell how glorious is the light of Heaven, That dark'ns the Sunne, Moone, Stars, and Planets seven: This onely tell: it is not PhÅbus light, Nor PhÅbes, nor the spangles of the night. That light which tongue cannot, nor mind descry, Once shalt thou see, a supreame Diety. 8. [Light is the Torches life of heavenly kind] Light is the Torches life of heavenly kind, Thus to a fraile and greasie masse combind, To which the Painter beauty doth impart, Giving it glosse and colour from his Art. The painting's nought, light doth the Torch commend Which first was framed onely for this end. It is our mind that doth our life approve, Shewing our race derived from above. Blind Fortunes goods, kins generosity Youths strength, and beauties curiosity Make not, unlesse the spirit doe us season With that Heav'n-bred sparkle of divine reason. 9. [My Light is pleasant, when the night doth gloome] My Light is pleasant, when the night doth gloome, And pitchy darkenesse lines the mourning roome; Whither thou lists Cleanthes smoake to blow, Or if the Matron like to twist her tow. When PhÅbus setteth, I watch centenall Vntill he from my station doth me call. Spare me, lend not my light to Titans ray; So shalt th' enjoy me when there is no day. If thy estate be meane, husband it well, And it Attalick wealth shall parallell. 10. [Foure Elements in this my body are] Foure Elements in this my body are All yockt in one, yet ever still at warre; As all agree to nourish this my light So to my ruine they combine their might: Aire maketh way for flame, Earth builds a pyre, My moisture feeds the still consuming fire. Still as I shine by light, by light I dy, As cause of life, so of mortality, It was Prometheus fault who stole away Heav'ns fire, and joyn'd it to his mortall clay. Moisture doth heat, and heat doth moisture quale, That dryes our body, this makes it dampe and fraile, That which doth give, doth likewise spend our breath; The first of being, is first houre of death. 11. [Whilst I give light to others, I decay] Whilst I give light to others, I decay; I lose my selfe, whilst I to others play: I watch all night with an unsleepy eye, And oft, before the day doth dawne, I dye: How oft am I by blustering Boreas mockt, And lightning others, I my selfe am chokt; If tumult, or a night assailing be, I am employ'd, no rest, no peace for me: What most of men neglect, that I observe, To succour others, though my selfe should starve: A Law but not of nature, which directs All of themselves to have the prime respects. Codrus the King, his Country to defend, Much like a Prodigall his life did spend; The Pelican to feede her plumelesse brood, Doth lance her breast, and straine her purest blood, The watchfull sheepherd seldome seeing sleepe, Directs, and keepes from wolves his straying sheepe: Even Christ himselfe, the Sonne of the most Hie, Did suffer death, least mortall man should die. 12. [Nature propounds a dilemme, chuse I must] Nature propounds a dilemme, chuse I must, Either to dye by light, or rot by rust: If I seeke ease and rest, then lazinesse Doth me consume with mouldy hoarinesse; But if I love to shine with glorious ray, Then by my flames in teares I melt away. Patience doth light'n this evill: I wish to live In glorious light, and light to others give, This life is worne out with laborious toile, And slothfull rest doth minde and body spoile; But yet it's better for to dye a sparke, Than like a laizie moule to live in darke. 13. [The Crafts-man did me of pure tallow frame] The Crafts-man did me of pure tallow frame, And made me fit to nourish heav'ns flame; One thing remain'd, that I should take with fire, When season due, and fit houre doth require: Loe how the rats catching me all alone, With envious teeth my body cease upon; I dye before my day, they life prevent; Before I live, my livelesse body's spent: I dying could with teares my death bemoane, But this untimely death doth yeeld me none. The infant so oft doth it selfe entombe, Before it see the day, in mothers wombe. So by untimely death youths hope decayes, Which might have well deserved many daies. 14. [When that my clammy substance was entire] When that my clammy substance was entire, I was an earthly nurse of heav'n-bred fire; Now envious time doth me in ashes turne And to a tedious snuffe my light doth burne: Loe I have done, take thou this light of mine; I yeeld, doe what thou canst, the turne is thine. So the Comedian having plaid his share, Gives place to others, who then actors are: A King his weighty office having done, Dying transfers his Scepter to his sonne: When that the crasie Souldiers strength doth faile, The younger must the enemy assaile. Happy is he the evening of whose daies Doth crowne his death with ever-living bayes. 15. [The glassie gulfe joyn'd with Earths globe in one] The glassie gulfe joyn'd with Earths globe in one Gives waters to the rivers, looseth none: The Sunne that makes so many glorious dayes, Doth loose no light, and still he wast's his rayes: The Loadstone to the iron gives vertue rare, And yet no wayes his owne he doth impaire: So this my torch can give to others light, And still, as is his wont, shine perfect bright. Thus Divine Wisdome doth communicate Her selfe, that others may participate. The good more common better is, and grace Wisheth, all were partakers of her case. 16. [The carefull Matrone in her cell below] The carefull Matrone in her cell below, Let fall a groat, yet where she did not know: Forthwith she tinnes a Light, then with her broome She neatly sweepes the corners of the roome. Thus from the dust and darkenesse when she finds it, More than the Phrygian Midas wealth she mindes it. Our soule a divine sparke since that it fell Into Cimmerian darkenesse of this cell, The soules true knowledge doth appeare no more Which goeth beyond Pygmalions richest store. Then must we light Cleanthes Lamp and find By study, the lost treasure of our mind. 17. [When PhÅbus sets in the Hesperian streames] When PhÅbus sets in the Hesperian streames And Westerne shores blush with his drowned beames; Then I as PhÅbus second must give Light, And act my part in darkenesse of the night: But now my Light complaines that I decay, And into greasie teares doe melt away; So I am forst to yeeld. O turne thy teame PhÅbus, and Phospher shew thy morning beame. When Christ the Sonne of righteousnesse did goe Vnto his Heavenly mansions from below Then he his holy servants did command, Conspicuous to the world, like lights, to stand; But when they faile with watching, toile, and age, And now are ready to goe off the stage, Then up they yeeld the light of life and cry; O come thou Sonne of righteousnesse, we die. 18. [In secret silence of the night what's done] In secret silence of the night what's done Is trust to me, concealed from the Sunne PhÅbus did Mars and Venus love betray, And turning backe did greater crimes bewray: What I doe see when witnesse is asleepe, That like Harpocrates I closely keepe. Let mortals learne to rule their tongue by me, What lawfull secret they doe heare or see. 19. [When as my Light much like an ev'ning starre] When as my Light much like an ev'ning starre, Did cast his glittering beames both neare and farre; Then light me glorious, flame me dreadfull made, And none injuriously durst me upbraide; But when my Light into a snuffe did turne, And cloth'd with darkenesse, I did cease to burne, Loe how without defence I naked stand, Thus torne and rent by this devouring band. Glory, as envy, so it terrour lends To Mortals: Majesty it selfe defends; But after treacherous Fortune flies away, To an unarmed dwarfe its made a prey. 20. [Thou goest about mischiefe and still dost feare] Thou goest about mischiefe and still dost feare, Least this my light 'gainst thee should witnesse beare; So having put me out thou think'st to worke Thy will, and yet in secret still to lurke. Thou art deceiv'd, the darknesse of this cell Containes a light, that sees the lowest hell. But thou a Want, canst not perceive this light, Neither discerne Sun-shine from cloudy night. Then shalt thou seeit, when the Diety Shall kindle that sparke which in thy breast doth ly. What e're thou dost looke to that Light which made All Lights, and shines as day in midnight shade. 21. [I am consumed with devouring fire] I am consumed with devouring fire, Whilst Vulcane gainst me doubles thus his ire: The hand, much like an Isthme, doth separate The flames, and doth it selfe prÃ¦cipitate Into open danger, shewing so its love, The scorching flames compels it to remove. A thriftlesse husband if he spend his state, And so the wife loving to goe too neat; Their stocke and meanes quickely goes to decay, And late repentance comes, when all's away. But if a friend their ruine would prevent, And stay their fall; be sure he shall be shent: He losing labour scarce shall harmelesse goe, They both against him turne their malice so. Oft times who parteth quarrels and debate, Against himselfe doth turne the parties hate. 22. [My splendor with his bright and Sun-like ray] My splendor with his bright and Sun-like ray, Doth cheere the house, and darkenesse chase away; To thee wh'art blind, I'm darke as sable night, It's thy default, not mine; thou lak'st thy sight. The Moule cannot Hypertons glory see; Who want their eyes, no comfort have by me. Christ is the glory of that light from hie, Which can the darkest Chaos full descry; And yet we see him not untill our eyes He open, which thickest darkenesse doth surprise; Then doth his light unto himselfe reflect From us as mirrours, with a new aspect. 23. [No glory could I shew, wer't not the night] No glory could I shew, wer't not the night In sable clouds did mantle up heavens light. When starres are vail'd, and PhÅb' her hornes doth hide, Laying her cresset and attire aside. The more nights fogge doth maske the spangled spheare, The more in darkenesse doth my Light appeare; Nights foggy cold doth make my flame more strong, And light's more glorious pitchy clouds among. If you together contraries paralell, By contrary opposition they excell. Vertue compare with vice; and you shall see, This shew his glory, that his infamie. 24. [Now Boreas puffing in his boistrous ire] Now Boreas puffing in his boistrous ire Blows as he were to kindle Vulcans fire: He doth undoe me by his churlishnesse, I am consumed more, and shine the lesse: He spends his labour, so I lose mine oyle, As no wayes fit to undergoe such toyle. You beat the Asse lingring under his load, The generous Horse deserveth not a goad: The Muses sonnes cannot away with lashes, Which are more fitting for Arcadian asses. Each strength within his limits, Nature bounds, Which who so passeth, Nature he confounds. 25. [Lights starre-like splendor doth allure this flye] Lights starre-like splendor doth allure this flye, Not knowing that she may be burnt thereby: Thus whilst she kindled with a great desire Of Light, loe how shee dies in flaming fire. Glory in purple robes is set on hie, Envious to many, lovely to the eye: But many times glory doth fooles undoe, Whilst, without wit and reason, they it wooe: It raiseth them that with the greater fall, It may them overthrow and crush withall. Whilst Icarus soares to Hyperions beames, He headlong fals into th' Icarian streames; And Pha'ton daring for to rule the day, Was thunder-beate, and burnt with PhÅbus ray. We nearer to the Sunne more glorious are, If of the scorching rayes we be aware. 26. [When I this wisht-for light to tinne desire] When I this wisht-for light to tinne desire, I prostrate crave it from this flaming fire; From whence if light come not in fitting time, I am consum'd before the light be mine. Whose meanes are small, whom Fortune favours not, They take their patrons mercy for their lot; To them their supplications they direct, Attending still with homage and respect; Delay undo'th them, makes them spend their oyle, Their hopes grow lesse, and greater is their toyle; Unlesse their Patrons timely shew their love: Our gifts, by timely giving, double prove. 27. [I shined brightly whilst I stood upright] I shined brightly whilst I stood upright, And firmely seated gave a perfect light; But after that mischance did me surprise, I am cast downe and know not how to rise. Helpe, helpe, who sees my case, now succour me, So, as before, my Light shall glorious be. A man may fall, this brittle life of ours Is subject to more chances than to houres: Or fortune false, or errours slippery fall Suffers us not, constant to proove at all: Happy is he who falling findes a man, Much like a God, supporting what he can. By hurt he learning gaines, he wiser growes, And with the weary Oxe more warily goes. 28. [All living things with others losse maintaine] All living things with others losse maintaine Their life, not so my harmelesse light I gaine. The plant doth feede upon the fertile soile; And bruitish beasts the pleasant plants doe spoile; So harmelesse beast, and bird, and fish must dy, To pamper mans too licorish gluttony. But of condition though I mortall be; Yet this my Light is onely nurst by me. The most of men doe live by others losse, Whilst others goods they to themselves engrosse: So man proves wolfe to man, and robbery gives Most gaine to him, who most unjustly lives. Thrice happy's he, who's of his state content, As if it were Crassus or CrÅsus rent. 29. [What e're my stat's, my love proves constant still] What e're my stat's, my love proves constant still To this my Soule, we part against our will; Or when fierce Boreas with his blustering gale, Or some mischance my lovely sight doth quale: Else I and Light my life, would never part, Before to ashes fates did me convert. Nature commands us to maintaine our breath And being, shunning life-destroying death. Yet man from Atropus oft takes the knife, And cuts his fatall thred devouring life: For why, he fearing death before his day, Before th' allarum, makes himselfe away. Ah wretch! unworthy to behold the skye, Who will not live, and knowes not how to dye. 30. [My Light is gone, yet hope doth still remaine] My Light is gone, yet hope doth still remaine, That Light revived shall me quick'n againe. I gaine by death, for so I longer last, Life shall returne, after some houres are past. All of us dye, when this our threed is spunne, And cut, deaths drousie sleepe is then begunne. After the ghuest is gone, the Innes decay, Our body's turn'd to rubbish and to clay, Vntill the soule returning doe possesse Our bodies in Eternall happinesse. 31. [My Light up to Heav'ns Mansions still doth move] My Light up to Heav'ns Mansions still doth move, Seeking his native place of rest above; But being ty'd in bondage to this frame, It stoopes to seeke his food, and feed his flame: So still it sinkes downeward, untill it turne Into a snuffe, and ashes cease to burne. My mind, I know not how, longeth to flye, Vnto the Heavenly Courts and Saphire sky, But still its plung'd, so to the body bound, That its compel'd to grovell on the ground: Thus cralling for its food my soule can fret, And tasting Lote, his Country doth forget. 32. [Svch is lights love to Heaven, that still above] Svch is lights love to Heaven, that still above It mounts, and cannot to the center move; Hold you it under, it will upward reach, And through its ruinous body make a breach. Our soule doth bend our bodies straight and even, As with it selfe, it would them raise to Heaven; But all in vaine it undergoes such toyle, The body will not leave its native soyle: Age puls it downe, and makes it stoope full low, Till death doth give his fatall overthrow Then through the bodies breach the Soule doth rise, And like a conquerour, mount to the skyes. 33. [I carry about with me, my frugall store] I carry about with me, my frugall store, With which I am content, and seeke no more; I fit be meane, I can with it agree, What state soever, welcome comes to me: I never begge; alive, what is distresse, I know not; but once dead, I care for't lesse. Some live on others trenchers, and doe eate The bread of sloth, for which they never sweat: They're greedy ravens of mankind, kitching drones, Rich tables harpyes, rats, Chamelions. The wiseman howsoever he doth finde Fortune, to it he fits and frames his mind, He doth preferre his course and country faire, Vnto his Patrons dole and dishes rare. 34. [When thou in darknesse of the night didst blaze] When thou in darknesse of the night didst blaze, I could not without envy on thee gaze; But when the Cyclop Titan comes in sight, There is no ods twixt darkenesse and thy light: I doe not envy thee, although thou shine; No glor' I have nor is the glory thine. As lightsome bodyes doe a shaddow give; So glory without envy cannot live: When greater glory doth the meane suppresse, It likewise takes the envy from the lesse. 35. [Who fearst outragious Vulcans damned ire] Who fearst outragious Vulcans damned ire, And wouldst be safe from night-surprising fire; Put out the flame, the smoaking snuffe suppresse, Least from the smoake the fire it selfe redresse; For fire is next to smoake, and oft its seene, That reaking snuffe a blazing fire hath beene. Who feares the damned fire of inward lust, And Cupids flames, observe this rule he must. Hearts concupiscence, 'fore it's vehement, Looke that in words he suffer't not to vent; For words are smoake of burning hearts desire; Smother his words, he needs not feare the fire: But otherwayes a whorish complement, Doth blow his fire, and makes him give consent. 36. [A thousand evils this my life doth spend] A thousand evils this my life doth spend, At length fierce Boreas thereto puts an end: My light, my heat, my flame and all is past; Onely, whilst breath remaines, my hope doth last. This life of ours is tost to and againe, Time and unconstant Fortune workes our bane: Care kils us, griefe, diseases doth outweare This life, Death dragges us to the dolefull biere. Fortune takes what she in the morning gave; Or enemies robbe and spoile what e're we have; Strength, beauty perish honours flye away, False friends, when meanes are gone, they will not stay: Hope's onely constant in adversity, Before she's kild by death, she will not fly. 37. [Whilst I did shine fierce Boreas put me out] Whilst I did shine fierce Boreas put me out, Againe he kindles me at the second bout: As sometimes did the clowne, now Boreas doth, Both heat and cold he breatheth from his mouth, The billow whom it cast into the maine, Returning threw him in the Shippe againe; Fortune throwes downe, then raiseth from the ground; Achilles speare doth cure whom it did wound. Losses prove good to some; whom Greece condemnd, The Persian for his vallour could commend. Be not cast downe, dispaire not at mischance, God who hath crossed thee, will thee advance. 38. [Hero who dwelt by Hellesponticke strand] Hero who dwelt by Hellesponticke strand, Hang'd forth a Light, Leanders marke for land, Whither his helmelesse course he steerd and mov'd, Whilst he made haste to see his welbelov'd, Which when fierce Boreas with his blustring blast Put out, he in the floods away was cast: So that his wedding light became a torch, To convoy him to Proserpines blacke porch. Almighty God who made all by his power, Holds forth his Light from the Celestiall Tower: That when the stormes our tossed soules annoy, It may direct us to our heav'nly joy. No storme against this Light can so prevaile But Saints unto their wisht-for Haven may saile. Where for their Wedding torch this Light they have, Which never shall convoy them to their grave. 39. [When as the waxen light and candle did shine] When as the waxen light and candle did shine, As was the taper, so the candle was fine: When light is gone, this gives an odious snuffe, That smels of Hyblas sweete nectarian stuffe. So when the wicked sits in honours chaire, Vnto the good man all doe him compare; But when death sparing none, his maske puls off, And changing Fortune sets him for a scoffe: Then to the frittle people he doth stinke, His name smels like a common-shore or sinke: The good againe, even in adversity, Cares not for Fortunes false inconstancy; And when against him death hath done her best, His name smells like the Phenix spicy nest. 40. [When stormie Boreas puts the seas in rage] When stormie Boreas puts the seas in rage, And swelling waves intesting warre do wage; When sun is darkn'd, when night doth heav'n confound, And foaming billowes give a discord sound. My light then leads the way through reeling strands, Guiding by Scyllas rocks, Charybdis sands. Here we are tossed in a maine of feares; But Christ our admirall the lanterne beares; Least we should suffer shipwracke in the night, He leads us through all dangers by his light. Who then would'st come to Heav'ns long wisht for bay, Follow thy Saviour who's Truth, Light, and Way. 41. [When as my Light with beames did brightly shine] When as my Light with beames did brightly shine, And starre-light was but equall unto mine; I was in great request and set above, Was deare to all, who saw me, did me love: Now breathing sighes, and languishing I grone: I'm hatefull to my selfe, belov'd of none. If once againe my light beginne to burne, With it my light and honour shall returne. When Fortune standing on her slippery ball, Doth favour, then are we admir'd of all; But if she frowne, then flatterers flye away, No friends abide, if once your meanes decay: O but if Fortune change, and smile againe, Then fawne these flatterers, and beare up your traine. Much like the Sea these Clients flote and flow; And Fortune turnes her coat, at every show. 42. [In vaine thou mantles up this light of mine] In vaine thou mantles up this light of mine, Thinking that no man shall perceive it shine. But all in vaine, flame will it selfe bewray And through thy coat, by burning, make his way. Who in his lower heart doth hurt conceale, Hoping that nothing shall the same reveale. He hides the torches of the hellish rout, Which will at length with violence burst out: Who doth conceive Orestis impious thought, It will ere long to furious fact be brought. Dissemble what thou can'st, that inward sparke Will burst forth into Light, though now its darke. 43. [The Smith the steele, so tempers in the fire] The Smith the steele, so tempers in the fire, As that it may indure flints stroke and ire; The flint and steel, 'gainst others while they strive, Give sparkles, which the tinder keeps alive; Vntill the sulphure to the match gives flame, Which keeps and to the candle doth give the same; The candle thus lighted proper use hath none: Thus all ordained is for man alone. Dame Nature so commandeth ev'ry thing In his owne kind to serve his lord and King; Things of meere being, and which doe not live, As Elements, food to the living give; The living herbs doe beasts with sense mainetaine, And these, to feede us, ev'ry houre are slaine: So every thing is for the use of man, To God should he not doe then, what he can? 44. [When as the conqu'ring fleete return'd from Troy] When as the conqu'ring fleete return'd from Troy, And Pallas stormy wrath did them annoy; Then Nauplius sought revenge upon the Greekes, And hang'd out Lanterns on the rocky creekes; The Greekes deceived did the rockes mistake, And dashing gainst them did nights shipwracke make. Whilst we unto our wisht-for Country goe, This lifes feirce billowes tosse us to and fro; Honour and glory hang out lights so faire, And Siren-like doe seeke us to ensnare: A joyfull, quiet haven they doe pretend; But oft they draw us to a dolefull end: If thou be wise shunne honours lights so hy, And from shipwracking Siren pleasure fly. 45. [My Light into a snuffe is almost turn'd] My Light into a snuffe is almost turn'd, And now the candle to smoaking ashes burn'd, Behold another Light stands ready by, Which to enjoy my place will make me dye. Yet not unpunish'd it puts out my breath, My very ashes doe revenge my death. So doth the sonne his Father make away, If not with sword, with griefe, before his day, That he his Fathers goods and meanes may joy, Which Nemesis revenging doth convoy. For oft the spendthrifts goods so evill gotten Are spent before his Fathers bones are rotten. 46. [Who so beholds this smoaky snuffe of mine] Who so beholds this smoaky snuffe of mine, He must needs thinke that sometime I did shine; But now my Light is gone, my glory's darke, Onely of light I have the brand and marke. Who for his Country hath with valour stood, His wounds doe shew, that he hath spent his blood: In Venus training who hath beene practised, Some token he beares of what he exercised. The Schollars badge, are sallow lookes and blanch, The gluttons is the fatnesse of his panch. Vertue and vice doth leave some token behind, Which of themselves doe put us still in minde. 47. [My Light is best maintain'd with little Oyle] My Light is best maintain'd with little Oyle, Too much of that which feeds me, doth me spoile. Deluge of waters drownes the fertile ground, Soft dropping raines makes it with grasse abound: Riot in cheere the body kils and minde, The meanest fare, the best for both we finde: Rather in Mica than Apollo dine, If thou wouldst wit and health still to be thine. 48. [Whilst theeves doe digge at middle of the night] Whilst theeves doe digge at middle of the night, Working the workes of darknesse, not of Light; No sooner through the window they me spy But they affrighted turne their backes and fly. This Light ill-doers no wayes can abide, Simply revealing, what they falsely hide. There was a time when all in darkenesse lay, When mortals had a naturall night, no day; Then Satan that arch-theefe did range abroad, Seeking in hearts and houses his aboad; But since that Christs bright Starre hath shewne his Light, Great Pan is dead, the Devill is put to flight. 49. [Before my Light was to the winds a scorne] Before my Light was to the winds a scorne, My body likewise subject to be torne; Now for a safeguard I this lanterne have, So whilst I shine from wrong it doth me save; Even as the Diamond his light forth sends, And with his hardnesse still himselfe defends. Honour is subject to unconstant chance, Nor can it without envy't selfe advance: Vertue to honour is a brasen wall, Guarded with which, it is not hurt at all; And how so ever Fortun's stormes doe blow, Yet Glory lurking thus, his light can show. 50. [This waxen torch is able to endure] This waxen torch is able to endure The winds, when Ãolus puts them in ure, It leads the way in darknesse of the night, And, though the serene fall, it shewes his Light: The candle still lurks at home, and there doth show Its light, not caring how the winds doe blow, This as the houses joy at home doth stay, The other still abroad doth make his way. The hardy husband from his house goes forth Seeking to compasse businesse of worth; He sailes by rockes and sands, earely and late He toiles, and seekes to purchase an estate: The wife at home much like a snaile she sits On hous-wifry employing all her wits: Vlysses in his travels hard did shift, Penelope at home did use her thrift. 51. [Whilst stormy winds about the Lanterne rage] Whilst stormy winds about the Lanterne rage, The light ought to have lurked in his cage; Vntimely love undoes him while he lends His Light, loe how his harmelesse life he spends. When troops of enemies besiege the wall, For feare of hurt, shut gates, though friends doe call. If that a friend accompanyed with a foe Doth come, feare neighbour danger, let him goe. If thou lov'st to be charitable, doe So good to others, that it hurt not you. 52. [This little rift and chap workes all my woe] This little rift and chap workes all my woe, Whilst thorow it fierce Boreas doth blow: A crevise is a City gate to death, Who still in ambush seekes to stop our breath: A little chinke doth drowne the loaded barke, A stately house is burned with a sparke; And one disease doth this our health annoy, One wound our life is able to destroy: One Sinne can Soule and Body overthrow Into the hell, and darkenesse thats below. Doe not a danger which is meane despise; From meanest causes greatest evils arise. 53. [One chinke there was and not another way] One chinke there was and not another way For Boreas, his fury to essay; So Hectors fatall gift Aiax confounded, And stob'd him where he onely could be wounded; Apollo so directed Paris dart To wound Achilles foote, and kill his heart. Death lies in ambush like an enemy, And brasheth where our sconces weakest be. Whether an icecle or drop of water, Or gnat, or Londons Scholler-killing letter. A thousand trickes we see of cunning death; He makes or finds a way to stop our breath. 54. [Ah wretch unworthy of thy infamous name] Ah wretch unworthy of thy infamous name, Burne not this sacred Church, to raise thy fame: For though twas built by Heath'ns impiety, Yet ought it not be thus destroy'd by thee: Trust me impiety every where is nought, And Heath'ns their heathen profanenesse dearely bought: Let Tolose gold, and Delphus robbery, And Hammons sandy ire this testifie: It's thine, not my default, for I was made For sacrifice, and to make Creatures glad. Nothing so harmelesse and so good can be, Which may not hurt, by mans impiety. 55. [Behold the Bridegroome comes, he takes his way.] Behold the Bridegroome comes, he takes his way. Nor Man, nor Angell knowes the houre or day; He saies, he'le come, much like a tbeefe in night, To judge the world with equity and right; Angels shall charge with trumpets sounding cleare, And Christ as Iudge shall in the clouds appeare; The righteous &amp; the wicked shall arise, Bodies and Soules, to passe upon that size; He who the oyle of preparation hath, Whom Christ shall find furnish'd with saving faith, Shall with the blessed Bridegroome mount on hie, Mongst Seraphimes triumphing gloriously; But he who hath no oyle, nor faith at all, Heavens dreadfull Iudge shall that man cursed call, And banish him into the pit of hell, Where with the fiends for ever he must dwell. 56. [Mvch like as wine the nurse of Poets veine] Mvch like as wine the nurse of Poets veine, When prison-like the caske doth it conteine; Farre from the bottome while you draw the wine, You will it find more plenteous and more fine; But when you come to dreg, no wine abounds, Both least and worst remaineth in the grounds: Such like the shining of a candle we see, Which kindled once burnes not still equally; At first it giv's greater and clearer light, And is more pleasant both to smell and sight; But when it comes to snuffe and even spent, It shineth lesse, and gives a filthy sent. The candle &amp; wine's our life, which, in its prime, Doth flourish more, and hath more hope of time; But when with mustie age our life decayes, Then many sorrowes have we, and few dayes. 57. [When first my light did shine, you lik'd me well.] When first my light did shine, you lik'd me well. Now that is gone; you hate my loathsome smell; You with prolongers made me live, and art Preserv'd my light; but now Time acts his part, Triumphant Time, shewes now my glasse is runne, (What way God knowes) I finde my threed is spunne; Envy hath playd its part, and I doe goe To Coffin: as I doe, all must doe so. Time breaths a shrewd and life-bereaving blast, Yet upward flyes my light, where it shall last. I'me glad to part from body, which I lov'd So deere, that many wayes and arts I prov'd The mudwall to maintaine, and body save, But yet in spight of me t'will go to grave. This is my comfort, Body, that thy tombe Which is thy grave, shall be thy mothers wombe To bring thee once againe unto the light, And life, which death shall never know, or night: Then be content, though you and I depart: Yet Soule and Body still shall have one heart. 58. [Flame goes to heav'n, from whence it once did come] Flame goes to heav'n, from whence it once did come, Bids earth adue, and what it hath therefrom, The snuffe to ashes, smoake turnes into ayre; Lights beauty's gone, which sometime was so faire: When death hath giv'n his last and fatall blow, Our soule to Heaven, our Earth to earth doth goe; Riches and honours, which it once did love, The Soule now lothes; and seekes to dwell above. Learne Mortals, all false pleasures to contemne, And treasures, which the soule must once condemne: Seeke rather for the graces of the minde, Which you your convoy to the Heaven will finde. Sursum corda. FINIS.</field>
