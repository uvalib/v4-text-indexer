      <field name="fulltext">[Oh could my mind, unfolded in my page] Oh could my mind, unfolded in my page, Enlighten climes and mould a future age There as it glewed, with noblest frenzy fraught, Dispense the treasures of exalted thought; To Virtue wake the pulses of the heart, And bid the tear of emulation start! Oh could it still, through each succeeding year, My life, my manners, and my name endear; And, when the poet sleeps in silent dust, Still hold communion with the wise and just!— Yet should this Verse, my leisure's best resource, When through the world it steals its secret course, Revive but once a generous wish supprest, Chase but a sigh or charm a care to rest; In one good deed a fleeting hour employ, Or flush one faded cheek with honest joy; Blest were my lines, though limited their sphere, Though short their date, as his who traced them here. 1793. THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY. IN TWO PARTS. 1792. ?Hoc est Vivere bis, vitâ posse priore frui. Mart. Part I. Dolce sentier,? Colle, che mi piacesti,? Ov' ancor per usanza Amor mi mena; Ben riconosco in voi l'usate forme, Non, lasso, in me. Petrarch. ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART. The Poem begins with the description of an obscure village, and of the pleasing melancholy which it excites on being revisited after a long absence. This mixed sensation is an effect of the Memory. From an effect we naturally ascend to the cause; and the subject proposed is then unfolded with an investigation of the nature and leading principles of this faculty. It is evident that our ideas flow in continual succession, and introduce each other with a certain degree of regularity. They are sometimes excited by sensible objects, and sometimes by an internal operation of the mind. Of the former species is most probably the memory of brutes; and its many sources of pleasure to them, as well as to us, are considered in the first part. The latter is the most perfect degree of memory, and forms the subject of the second. When ideas have any relation whatever, they are attractive of each other in the mind; and the perception of any object naturally leads to the idea of another, which was connected with it either in time or place, or which can be compared or contrasted with it. Hence arises our attachment to inanimate objects; hence also, in some degree, the love of our country, and the emotion with which we contemplate the celebrated scenes of antiquity. Hence a picture directs our thoughts to the original: and, as cold and darkness suggest forcibly the ideas of heat and light, he, who feels the infirmities of age, dwells most on whatever reminds him of the vigour and vivacity of his youth. The associating principle, as here employed, is no less conducive to virtue than to happiness; and, as such, it frequently discovers itself in the most tumultuous scenes of life. It addresses our finer feelings, and gives exercise to every mild and generous propensity. Not confined to man, it extends through all animated nature; and its effects are peculiarly striking in the domestic tribes. Twilight's soft dews steal o'er the village-green, With magic tints to harmonize the scene. Stilled is the hum that thro' the hamlet broke, When round the ruins of their ancient oak The peasants flocked to hear the minstrel play, And games and carols closed the busy day. Her wheel at rest, the matron thrills no more With treasured tales, and legendary lore. All, all are fled; nor mirth nor music flows To chase the dreams of innocent repose. All, all are fled; yet still I linger here! What secret charms this silent spot endear? Mark yon old Mansion frowning thro' the trees, Whose hollow turret wooes the whistling breeze. That casement, arched with ivy's brownest shade, First to these eyes the light of heaven conveyed. The mouldering gateway strews the grass-grown court, Once the calm scene of many a simple sport; When all things pleased, for life itself was new, And the heart promised what the fancy drew. See, thro' the fractured pediment revealed, Where moss inlays the rudely sculptured shield, The martin's old, hereditary nest. Long may the ruin spare its hallowed guest! As jars the hinge, what sullen echoes call! Oh haste, unfold the hospitable hall! That hall, where once, in antiquated state, The chair of justice held the grave debate. Now stained with dews, with cobwebs darkly hung, Oft has its roof with peals of rapture rung; When round yon ample board, in due degree, We sweetened every meal with social glee. The heart's light laugh pursued the circling jest; And all was sunshine in each little breast. 'Twas here we chased the slipper by the sound; And turned the blindfold hero round and round. 'Twas here, at eve, we formed our fairy ring; And Fancy fluttered on her wildest wing. Giants and genii chained each wondering ear, And orphan-sorrows drew the ready tear. Oft with the babes we wandered in the wood, Or viewed the forest-feats of Robin Hood: Oft, fancy-led, at midnight's fearful hour, With startling step we scaled the lonely tower; O'er infant innocence to hang and weep, Murdered by ruffian hands, when smiling in its sleep. Ye Household Deities! whose guardian eye Marked each pure thought, ere registered on high; Still, still ye walk the consecrated ground, And breathe the soul of Inspiration round. As o'er the dusky furniture I bend, Each chair awakes the feelings of a friend. The storied arras, source of fond delight, With old achievement charms the wildered sight; And still, with Heraldry's rich hues imprest, On the dim window glows the pictured crest. The screen unfolds its many-coloured chart. The clock still points its moral to the heart. That faithful monitor, 'twas heaven to hear, When soft it spoke a promised pleasure near; And has its sober hand, its simple chime, Forgot to trace the feathered feet of Time? That massive beam, with curious carvings wrought, Whence the caged linnet soothed my pensive thought; Those muskets, cased with venerable rust; Those once-loved forms, still breathing thro' their dust, Still, from the frame in mould gigantic cast, Starting to life—all whisper of the Past! As thro' the garden's desert paths I rove, What fond illusions swarm in every grove! How oft, when purple evening tinged the west, We watched the emmet to her grainy nest; Welcomed the wild-bee home on weary wing, Laden with sweets, the choicest of the spring! How oft inscribed, with Friendship's votive rhyme, The bark now silvered by the touch of Time; Soared in the swing, half pleased and half afraid, Thro' sister elms that waved their summer-shade; Or strewed with crumbs yon root-inwoven seat, To lure the redbreast from his lone retreat! Childhood's loved group revisits every scene; The tangled wood-walk and the tufted green! Indulgent Memory wakes, and lo, they live! Clothed with far softer hues than Light can give. Thou first, best friend that Heaven assigns below To sooth and sweeten all the cares we know; Whose glad suggestions still each vain alarm, When nature fades and life forgets to charm; Thee would the Muse invoke!—to thee belong The sage's precept and the poet's song. What softened views thy magic glass reveals, When o'er the landscape Time's meek twilight steals! As when in ocean sinks the orb of day, Long on the wave reflected lustres play; Thy tempered gleams of happiness resigned Glance on the darkened mirror of the mind. The School's lone porch, with reverend mosses grey, Just tells the pensive pilgrim where it lay. Mute is the bell that rung at peep of dawn, Quickening my truant-feet across the lawn; Unheard the shout that rent the noontide air, When the slow dial gave a pause to care. Up springs, at every step, to claim a tear, Some little friendship formed and cherished here; And not the lightest leaf, but trembling teems With golden visions and romantic dreams! Down by yon hazel copse, at evening, blazed The Gipsy's fagot—there we stood and gazed; Gazed on her sun-burnt face with silent awe, Her tattered mantle, and her hood of straw; Her moving lips, her caldron brimming o'er; The drowsy brood that on her back she bore, Imps, in the barn with mousing owlet bred, From rifled roost at nightly revel fed; Whose dark eyes flashed thro' locks of blackest shade, When in the breeze the distant watch-dog bayed:— And heroes fled the Sibyl's muttered call, Whose elfin prowess scaled the orchard-wall. As o'er my palm the silver piece she drew, And traced the line of life with searching view, How throbbed my fluttering pulse with hopes and fears, To learn the colour of my future years! Ah, then, what honest triumph flushed my breast; This truth once known—To bless is to be blest! We led the bending beggar on his way, (Bare were his feet, his tresses silver-grey) Soothed the keen pangs his aged spirit felt, And on his tale with mute attention dwelt. As in his scrip we dropt our little store, And sighed to think that little was no more, He breathed his prayer, “Long may such goodness live!” 'Twas all he gave, 'twas all he had to give. Angels, when Mercy's mandate winged their flight, Had stopt to dwell with pleasure on the sight. But hark! thro' those old firs, with sullen swell, The church-clock strikes! ye tender scenes, farewell! It calls me hence, beneath their shade, to trace The few fond lines that Time may soon efface. On yon grey stone, that fronts the chancel-door, Worn smooth by busy feet now seen no more, Each eve we shot the marble thro' the ring, When the heart danced, and life was in its spring, Alas! unconscious of the kindred earth, That faintly echoed to the voice of mirth. The glow-worm loves her emerald-light to shed Where now the sexton rests his hoary head. Oft, as he turned the greensward with his spade, He lectured every youth that round him played; And, calmly pointing where our fathers lay, Roused us to rival each, the hero of his day. Hush, ye fond flutterings, hush! while here alone I search the records of each mouldering stone. Guides of my life! Instructors of my youth! Who first unveiled the hallowed form of Truth! Whose every word enlightened and endeared; In age beloved, in poverty revered; In Friendship's silent register ye live, Nor ask the vain memorial Art can give. But when the sons of peace, of pleasure sleep, When only Sorrow wakes, and wakes to weep, What spells entrance my visionary mind With sighs so sweet, with transports so refined? Ethereal Power! who at the noon of night Recall'st the far-fled spirit of delight; From whom that musing, melancholy mood Which charms the wise, and elevates the good; Blest Memory, hail! O grant the grateful Muse, Her pencil dipt in Nature's living hues, To pass the clouds that round thy empire roll, And trace its airy precincts in the soul. Lulled in the countless chambers of the brain, Our thoughts are linked by many a hidden chain. Awake but one, and lo, what myriads rise! Each stamps its image as the other flies. Each, as the various avenues of sense Delight or sorrow to the soul dispense, Brightens or fades; yet all, with magic art, Control the latent fibres of the heart. As studious Prospero's mysterious spell Drew every subject-spirit to his cell; Each, at thy call, advances or retires, As judgment dictates or the scene inspires. Each thrills the seat of sense, that sacred source Whence the fine nerves direct their mazy course, And thro' the frame invisibly convey The subtle, quick vibrations as they play; Man's little universe at once o'ercast, At once illumined when the cloud is past. Survey the globe, each ruder realm explore; From Reason's faintest ray to Newton soar. What different spheres to human bliss assigned! What slow gradations in the scale of mind! Yet mark in each these mystic wonders wrought; Oh mark the sleepless energies of thought! The adventurous boy, that asks his little share, And hies from home with many a gossip's prayer, Turns on the neighbouring hill, once more to see The dear abode of peace and privacy; And as he turns, the thatch among the trees, The smoke's blue wreaths ascending with the breeze, The village-common spotted white with sheep, The church-yard yews round which his fathers sleep; All rouse Reflection's sadly-pleasing train, And oft he looks and weeps, and looks again. So, when the mild Tupia dared explore Arts yet untaught, and worlds unknown before, And, with the sons of Science, woo'd the gale That, rising, swelled their strange expanse of sail; So, when he breathed his firm yet fond adieu, Borne from his leafy hut, his carved canoe, And all his soul best loved—such tears he shed, While each soft scene of summer-beauty fled. Long o'er the wave a wistful look he cast, Long watched the streaming signal from the mast; Till twilight's dewy tints deceived his eye, And fairy-forests fringed the evening-sky. So Scotia's Queen, as slowly dawned the day, Rose on her couch and gazed her soul away. Her eyes had blessed the beacon's glimmering height, That faintly tipt the feathery surge with light; But now the morn with orient hues pourtrayed Each castled cliff and brown monastic shade: All touched the talisman's resistless spring, And lo, what busy tribes were instant on the wing! Thus kindred objects kindred thoughts inspire, As summer-clouds flash forth electric fire. And hence this spot gives back the joys of youth, Warm as the life, and with the mirror's truth. Hence home-felt pleasure prompts the Patriot's sigh; This makes him wish to live, and dare to die. For this young Foscari, whose hapless fate Venice should blush to hear the Muse relate, When exile wore his blooming years away, To sorrow's long soliloquies a prey, When reason, justice, vainly urged his cause, For this he roused her sanguinary laws; Glad to return, tho' Hope could grant no more, And chains and torture hailed him to the shore. And hence the charm historic scenes impart; Hence Tiber awes, and Avon melts the heart. Aërial forms in Tempe's classic vale Glance thro' the gloom and whisper in the gale; In wild Vaucluse with love and Laura dwell, And watch and weep in Eloïsa's cell. 'Twas ever thus. Young Ammon, when he sought Where Ilium stood and where Pelides fought, Sate at the helm himself. No meaner hand Steered thro' the waves; and, when he struck the land, Such in his soul the ardour to explore, Pelides-like, he leaped the first ashore. 'Twas ever thus. As now at Virgil's tomb We bless the shade and bid the verdure bloom; So Tully paused, amid the wrecks of Time, On the rude stone to trace the truth sublime; When at his feet, in honoured dust disclosed, The immortal Sage of Syracuse reposed. And as he long in sweet delusion hung, Where once a Plato taught, a Pindar sung; Who now but meets him musing, when he roves His ruined Tusculan's romantic groves? In Rome's great forum, who but hears him roll His moral thunders o'er the subject soul? And hence that calm delight the portrait gives: We gaze on every feature till it lives! Still the fond lover sees the absent maid; And the lost friend still lingers in his shade! Say why the pensive widow loves to weep, When on her knee she rocks her babe to sleep: Tremblingly still, she lifts his veil to trace The father's features in his infant face. The hoary grandsire smiles the hour away, Won by the raptures of a game at play; He bends to meet each artless burst of joy, Forgets his age, and acts again the boy. What tho' the iron school of War erase Each milder virtue and each softer grace; What tho' the fiend's torpedo-touch arrest Each gentler, finer impulse of the breast; Still shall this active principle preside, And wake the tear to Pity's self denied. The intrepid Swiss, who guards a foreign shore, Condemned to climb his mountain-cliffs no more, If chance he hears the song so sweet, so wild, His heart would spring to hear it when a child, Melts at the long-lost scenes that round him rise, And sinks a martyr to repentant sighs. Ask not if courts or camps dissolve the charm: Say why Vespasian loved his Sabine farm; Why great Navarre, when France and freedom bled, Sought the lone limits of a forest-shed. When Diocletian's self-corrected mind The imperial fasces of a world resigned, Say why we trace the labours of his spade In calm Salona's philosophic shade. Say, when contentious Charles renounced a throne To muse with monks and meditate alone, What from his soul the parting tribute drew? What claimed the sorrows of a last adieu? The still retreats that soothed his tranquil breast Ere grandeur dazzled, and its cares oppressed. Undamped by time, the generous Instinct glows Far as Angola's sands, as Zembla's snows; Glows in the tiger's den, the serpent's nest, On every form of varied life imprest. The social tribes its choicest influence hail:— And when the drum beats briskly in the gale, The war-worn courser charges at the sound, And with young vigour wheels the pasture round, Oft has the aged tenant of the vale Leaned on his staff to lengthen out the tale; Oft have his lips the grateful tribute breathed, From sire to son with pious zeal bequeathed. When o'er the blasted heath the day declined, And on the scathed oak warred the winter-wind; When not a distant taper's twinkling ray Gleamed o'er the furze to light him on his way; When not a sheep-bell soothed his listening ear, And the big rain-drops told the tempest near; Then did his horse the homeward track descry, The track that shunned his sad, inquiring eye; And win each wavering purpose to relent, With warmth so mild, so gently violent, That his charmed hand the careless rein resigned, And doubts and terrors vanished from his mind. Recall the traveller, whose altered form Has borne the buffet of the mountain-storm; And who will first his fond impatience meet? His faithful dog's already at his feet! Yes, tho' the porter spurn him from the door, Tho' all, that knew him, know his face no more, His faithful dog shall tell his joy to each, With that mute eloquence which passes speech.— And see, the master but returns to die! Yet who shall bid the watchful servant fly? The blasts of heaven, the drenching dews of earth, The wanton insults of unfeeling mirth, These, when to guard Misfortune's sacred grave, Will firm Fidelity exult to brave. Led by what chart, transports the timid dove The wreaths of conquest, or the vows of love? Say, thro' the clouds what compass points her flight? Monarchs have gazed, and nations blessed the sight. Pile rocks on rocks, bid woods and mountains rise, Eclipse her native shades, her native skies:— 'Tis vain! thro' Ether's pathless wilds she goes, And lights at last where all her cares repose. Sweet bird! thy truth shall Harlem's walls attest, And unborn ages consecrate thy nest. When, with the silent energy of grief, With looks that asked, yet dared not hope relief, Want with her babes round generous Valour clung, To wring the slow surrender from his tongue, 'Twas thine to animate her closing eye; Alas! 'twas thine perchance the first to die, Crushed by her meagre hand when welcomed from the sky. Hark! the bee winds her small but mellow horn, Blithe to salute the sunny smile of morn. O'er thymy downs she bends her busy course, And many a stream allures her to its source. 'Tis noon, 'tis night. That eye so finely wrought, Beyond the search of sense, the soar of thought, Now vainly asks the scenes she left behind; Its orb so full, its vision so confined! Who guides the patient pilgrim to her cell? Who bids her soul with conscious triumph swell? With conscious truth retrace the mazy clue Of summer-scents, that charmed her as she flew? Hail, Memory, hail! thy universal reign Guards the least link of Being's glorious chain. Part II. Delle cose custode e dispensiera. Tasso. ANALYSIS OF THE SECOND PART. The Memory has hitherto acted only in subservience to the senses, and so far man is not eminently distinguished from other animals: but, with respect to man, she has a higher province; and is often busily employed, when excited by no external cause whatever. She preserves, for his use, the treasures of art and science, history and philosophy. She colours all the prospects of life; for we can only anticipate the future, by concluding what is possible from what is past. On her agency depends every effusion of the Fancy, who with the boldest effort can only compound or transpose, augment or diminish the materials which she has collected and still retains. When the first emotions of despair have subsided and sorrow has softened into melancholy, she amuses with a retrospect of innocent pleasures, and inspires that noble confidence which results from the consciousness of having acted well. When sleep has suspended the organs of sense from their office, she not only supplies the mind with images, but assists in their combination. And even in madness itself, when the soul is resigned over to the tyranny of a distempered imagination, she revives past perceptions, and awakens that train of thought which was formerly most familiar. Nor are we pleased only with a review of the brighter passages of life. Events, the most distressing in their immediate consequences, are often cherished in remembrance with a degree of enthusiasm. But the world and its occupations give a mechanical impulse to the passions, which is not very favourable to the indulgence of this feeling. It is in a calm and well-regulated mind that the Memory is most perfect; and solitude is her best sphere of action. With this sentiment is introduced a Tale illustrative of her influence in solitude, sickness, and sorrow. And the subject having now been considered, so far as it relates to man and the animal world, the Poem concludes with a conjecture that superior beings are blessed with a nobler exercise of this faculty. Sweet Memory, wafted by thy gentle gale, Oft up the stream of Time I turn my sail, To view the fairy-haunts of long-lost hours, Blest with far greener shades, far fresher flowers. Ages and climes remote to Thee impart What charms in Genius and refines in Art; Thee, in whose hands the keys of Science dwell, The pensive portress of her holy cell; Whose constant vigils chase the chilling damp Oblivion steals upon her vestal-lamp. They in their glorious course the guides of Youth, Whose language breathed the eloquence of Truth; Whose life, beyond preceptive wisdom, taught The great in conduct, and the pure in thought; These still exist, by Thee to Fame consigned, Still speak and act, the models of mankind. From Thee gay Hope her airy colouring draws; And Fancy's flights are subject to thy laws. From Thee that bosom-spring of rapture flows, Which only Virtue, tranquil Virtue, knows. When Joy's bright sun has shed his evening-ray, And Hope's delusive meteors cease to play; When clouds on clouds the smiling prospect close, Still thro' the gloom thy star serenely glows: Like yon fair orb, she gilds the brow of night With the mild magic of reflected light. The beauteous maid, who bids the world adieu, Oft of that world will snatch a fond review; Oft at the shrine neglect her beads, to trace Some social scene, some dear, familiar face: And ere, with iron tongue, the vesper-bell Bursts thro' the cypress-walk, the convent-cell, Oft will her warm and wayward heart revive, To love and joy still tremblingly alive; The whispered vow, the chaste caress prolong, Weave the light dance and swell the choral song; With rapt ear drink the enchanting serenade, And, as it melts along the moonlight-glade, To each soft note return as soft a sigh, And bless the youth that bids her slumbers fly. But not till Time has calmed the ruffled breast, Are these fond dreams of happiness confest. Not till the rushing winds forget to rave, Is Heaven's sweet smile reflected on the wave. From Guinea's coast pursue the lessening sail, And catch the sounds that sadden every gale. Tell, if thou canst, the sum of sorrows there; Mark the fixed gaze, the wild and frenzied glare, The racks of thought, and freezings of despair! But pause not then—beyond the western wave, Go, see the captive bartered as a slave! Crushed till his high, heroic spirit bleeds, And from his nerveless frame indignantly recedes. Yet here, even here, with pleasures long resigned, Lo! Memory bursts the twilight of the mind. Her dear delusions soothe his sinking soul, When the rude scourge assumes its base control; And o'er Futurity's blank page diffuse The full reflection of her vivid hues. 'Tis but to die, and then, to weep no more, Then will he wake on Congo's distant shore; Beneath his plantain's ancient shade renew The simple transports that with freedom flew; Catch the cool breeze that musky Evening blows, And quaff the palm's rich nectar as it glows; The oral tale of elder time rehearse, And chant the rude, traditionary verse With those, the loved companions of his youth, When life was luxury, and friendship truth. Ah, why should Virtue fear the frowns of Fate? Hers what no wealth can buy, no power create! A little world of clear and cloudless day, Nor wrecked by storms, nor mouldered by decay; A world, with Memory's ceaseless sunshine blest, The home of Happiness, an honest breast. But most we mark the wonders of her reign, When Sleep has locked the senses in her chain. When sober Judgment has his throne resigned, She smiles away the chaos of the mind; And, as warm Fancy's bright Elysium glows, From Her each image springs, each colour flows. She is the sacred guest! the immortal friend! Oft seen o'er sleeping Innocence to bend, In that dead hour of night to Silence given, Whispering seraphic visions of her heaven. When the blithe son of Savoy, journeying round With humble wares and pipe of merry sound, From his green vale and sheltered cabin hies, And scales the Alps to visit foreign skies; Tho' far below the forkèd lightnings play, And at his feet the thunder dies away, Oft, in the saddle rudely rocked to sleep, While his mule browses on the dizzy steep, With Memory's aid, he sits at home, and sees His children sport beneath their native trees, And bends to hear their cherub-voices call, O'er the loud fury of the torrent's fall. But can her smile with gloomy Madness dwell? Say, can she chase the horrors of his cell? Each fiery flight on Frenzy's wing restrain, And mould the coinage of the fevered brain? Pass but that grate, which scarce a gleam supplies, There in the dust the wreck of Genius lies! He, whose arresting hand divinely wrought Each bold conception in the sphere of thought; And round, in colours of the rainbow, threw Forms ever fair, creations ever new! But, as he fondly snatched the wreath of Fame, The spectre Poverty unnerved his frame. Cold was her grasp, a withering scowl she wore; And Hope's soft energies were felt no more. Yet still how sweet the soothings of his art! From the rude wall what bright ideas start! Even now he claims the amaranthine wreath, With scenes that glow, with images that breathe! And whence these scenes, these images, declare, Whence but from Her who triumphs o'er despair? Awake, arise! with grateful fervour fraught, Go, spring the mine of elevating thought. He, who, thro' Nature's various walk, surveys The good and fair her faultless line pourtrays; Whose mind, profaned by no unhallowed guest, Culls from the crowd the purest and the best; May range, at will, bright Fancy's golden clime, Or, musing, mount where Science sits sublime, Or wake the Spirit of departed Time. Who acts thus wisely, mark the moral Muse, A blooming Eden in his life reviews! So rich the culture, tho' so small the space, Its scanty limits he forgets to trace. But the fond fool, when evening shades the sky, Turns but to start, and gazes but to sigh! The weary waste, that lengthened as he ran, Fades to a blank, and dwindles to a span! Ah! who can tell the triumphs of the mind, By truth illumined and by taste refined? When age has quenched the eye and closed the ear, Still nerved for action in her native sphere, Oft will she rise—with searching glance pursue Some long-loved image vanished from her view; Dart thro' the deep recesses of the Past, O'er dusky forms in chains of slumber cast; With giant-grasp fling back the folds of night, And snatch the faithless fugitive to light. So thro' the grove the impatient mother flies, Each sunless glade, each secret pathway tries; Till the thin leaves the truant boy disclose, Long on the wood-moss stretched in sweet repose. Nor yet to pleasing objects are confined The silent feasts of the reflecting mind. Danger and death a dread delight inspire; And the bald veteran glows with wonted fire, When, richly bronzed by many a summer-sun, He counts his scars, and tells what deeds were done. Go, with old Thames, view Chelsea's glorious pile, And ask the shattered hero, whence his smile? Go, view the splendid domes of Greenwich—Go, And own what raptures from Reflection flow. Hail, noblest structures imaged in the wave! A nation's grateful tribute to the brave. Hail, blest retreats from war and shipwreck, hail! That oft arrest the wondering stranger's sail. Long have ye heard the narratives of age, The battle's havoc and the tempest's rage; Long have ye known Reflection's genial ray Gild the calm close of Valour's various day. Time's sombrous touches soon correct the piece, Mellow each tint, and bid each discord cease: A softer tone of light pervades the whole, And steals a pensive languor o'er the soul. Hast thou thro' Eden's wild-wood vales pursued Each mountain-scene, majestically rude; To note the sweet simplicity of life, Far from the din of Folly's idle strife; Nor there awhile, with lifted eye, revered That modest stone which pious Pembroke reared; Which still records, beyond the pencil's power, The silent sorrows of a parting hour; Still to the musing pilgrim points the place Her sainted spirit most delights to trace? Thus, with the manly glow of honest pride, O'er his dead son the gallant Ormond sighed. Thus, thro' the gloom of Shenstone's fairy grove, Maria's urn still breathes the voice of love. As the stern grandeur of a Gothic tower Awes us less deeply in its morning-hour, Than when the shades of Time serenely fall On every broken arch and ivied wall; The tender images we love to trace, Steal from each year a melancholy grace! And as the sparks of social love expand, As the heart opens in a foreign land; And, with a brother's warmth, a brother's smile, The stranger greets each native of his isle; So scenes of life, when present and confest, Stamp but their bolder features on the breast; Yet not an image, when remotely viewed, However trivial, and however rude, But wins the heart, and wakes the social sigh, With every claim of close affinity! But these pure joys the world can never know; In gentler climes their silver currents flow. Oft at the silent, shadowy close of day, When the hushed grove has sung its parting lay; When pensive Twilight, in her dusky car, Comes slowly on to meet the evening-star; Above, below, aërial murmurs swell, From hanging wood, brown heath, and bushy dell! A thousand nameless rills, that shun the light, Stealing soft music on the ear of night. So oft the finer movements of the soul, That shun the sphere of Pleasure's gay control, In the still shades of calm Seclusion rise, And breathe their sweet, seraphic harmonies! Once, and domestic annals tell the time, (Preserved in Cumbria's rude, romantic clime) When Nature smiled, and o'er the landscape threw Her richest fragrance, and her brightest hue, A blithe and blooming Forester explored Those loftier scenes Salvator's soul adored; The rocky pass half-hung with shaggy wood, And the cleft oak flung boldly o'er the flood; Nor shunned the track, unknown to human tread, That downward to the night of caverns led; Some ancient cataraot's deserted bed. High on exulting wing the heath-cock rose, And blew his shrill blast o'er perennial snows; Ere the rapt youth, recoiling from the roar, Gazed on the tumbling tide of dread Lodore; And thro' the rifted cliffs, that scaled the sky, Derwent's clear mirror charmed his dazzled eye. Each osier isle, inverted on the wave, Thro' morn's grey mist its melting colours gave: And, o'er the cygnet's haunt, the mantling grove Its emerald arch with wild luxuriance wove. Light as the breeze that brushed the orient dew, From rock to rock the young Adventurer flew; And day's last sunshine slept along the shore, When lo, a path the smile of welcome wore. Imbowering shrubs with verdure veiled the sky, And on the musk-rose shed a deeper dye; Save when a bright and momentary gleam Glanced from the white foam of some sheltered stream. O'er the still lake the bell of evening tolled, And on the moor the shepherd penned his fold; And on the green hill's side the meteor played; When, hark! a voice sung sweetly thro' the shade. It ceased—yet still in Florio's fancy sung, Still on each note his captive spirit hung; Till o'er the mead a cool, sequestered grot From its rich roof a sparry lustre shot. A crystal water crossed the pebbled floor, And on the front these simple lines it bore. Hence away, nor dare intrude! In this secret, shadowy cell Musing Memory loves to dwell, With her sister Solitude. Far from the busy world she flies, To taste that peace the world denies. Entranced she sits; from youth to age, Reviewing Life's eventful page; And noting, ere they fade away, The little lines of yesterday. Florio had gained a rude and rocky seat, When lo, the Genius of this still retreat! Fair was her form—but who can hope to trace The pensive softness of her angel-face? Can Virgil's verse, can Raphael's touch impart Those finer features of the feeling heart, Those tend'rer tints that shun the careless eye And in the world's contagious climate die? She left the cave, nor marked the stranger there; Her pastoral beauty and her artless air Had breathed a soft enchantment o'er his soul! In every nerve he felt her blest control! What pure and white-winged agents of the sky, Who rule the springs of sacred sympathy, Inform congenial spirits when they meet? Sweet is their office, as their natures sweet! Florio, with fearful joy, pursued the maid, Till thro' a vista's moonlight-chequered shade, Where the bat circled, and the rooks reposed, (Their wars suspended, and their councils closed) An antique mansion burst in solemn state, A rich vine clustering round the Gothic gate. Nor paused he there. The master of the scene Saw his light step imprint the dewy green; And, slow-advancing, hailed him as his guest, Won by the honest warmth his looks expressed. He wore the rustic manners of a Squire; Age had not quenched one spark of manly fire; But giant Gout had bound him in her chain, And his heart panted for the chase in vain. Yet here Remembrance, sweetly-soothing Power! Winged with delight Confinement's lingering hour. The fox's brush still emulous to wear, He scoured the county in his elbow-chair; And, with view-halloo, roused the dreaming hound That rung, by starts, his deep-toned music round. Long by the paddock's humble pale confined, His aged hunters coursed the viewless wind: And each, with glowing energy pourtrayed, The far-famed triumphs of the field displayed; Usurped the canvass of the crowded hall, And chased a line of heroes from the wall. There slept the horn each jocund echo knew, And many a smile and many a story drew! High o'er the hearth his forest-trophies hung, And their fantastic branches wildly flung. How would he dwell on the vast antlers there! These dashed the wave, those fanned the mountain-air. All, as they frowned, unwritten records bore Of gallant feats and festivals of yore. But why the tale prolong?—His only child, His darling Julia, on the stranger smiled. Her little arts a fretful sire to please, Her gentle gaiety and native ease Had won his soul; and rapturous Fancy shed Her golden lights and tints of rosy red. But ah! few days had passed, ere the bright vision fled! When Evening tinged the lake's ethereal blue, And her deep shades irregularly threw; Their shifting sail dropt gently from the cove, Down by St. Herbert's consecrated grove; Whence erst the chanted hymn, the tapered rite Amused the fisher's solitary night; And still the mitred window, richly wreathed, A sacred calm thro' the brown foliage breathed. The wild deer, starting thro' the silent glade, With fearful gaze their various course surveyed. High hung in air the hoary goat reclined, His streaming beard the sport of every wind; And, while the coot her jet-wing loved to lave, Rocked on the bosom of the sleepless wave; The eagle rushed from Skiddaw's purple crest, A cloud still brooding o'er her giant-nest. And now the moon had dimmed with dewy ray The few fine flushes of departing day. O'er the wide water's deep serene she hung, And her broad lights on every mountain flung; When lo! a sudden blast the vessel blew, And to the surge consigned the little crew. All, all escaped—but ere the lover bore His faint and faded Julia to the shore, Her sense had fled!—Exhausted by the storm, A fatal trance hung o'er her pallid form; Her closing eye a trembling lustre fired; 'Twas life's last spark—it fluttered and expired! The father strewed his white hairs in the wind, Called on his child—nor lingered long behind: And Florio lived to see the willow wave, With many an evening-whisper, o'er their grave. Yes, Florio lived—and, still of each possessed, The father cherished, and the maid caressed! For ever would the fond Enthusiast rove, With Julia's spirit, thro' the shadowy grove; Gaze with delight on every scene she planned, Kiss every floweret planted by her hand. Ah! still he traced her steps along the glade, When hazy hues and glimmering lights betrayed Half-viewless forms; still listened as the breeze Heaved its deep sobs among the aged trees; And at each pause her melting accents caught, In sweet delirium of romantic thought! Dear was the grot that shunned the blaze of day; She gave its spars to shoot a trembling ray. The spring, that bubbled from its inmost cell, Murmured of Julia's virtues as it fell; And o'er the dripping moss, the fretted stone, In Florio's ear breathed language not its own. Her charm around the enchantress Memory threw, A charm that soothes the mind, and sweetens too! But is Her magic only felt below? Say, thro' what brighter realms she bids it flow; To what pure beings, in a nobler sphere, She yields delight but faintly imaged here: All that till now their rapt researches knew, Not called in slow succession to review; But, as a landscape meets the eye of day, At once presented to their glad survey! Each scene of bliss revealed, since chaos fled, And dawning light its dazzling glories spread; Each chain of wonders that sublimely glowed, Since first Creation's choral anthem flowed; Each ready flight, at Mercy's call divine, To distant worlds that undiscovered shine; Full on her tablet flings its living rays, And all, combined, with blest effulgence blaze. There thy bright train, immortal Friendship, soar; No more to part, to mingle tears no more! And, as the softening hand of Time endears The joys and sorrows of our infant-years, So there the soul, released from human strife, Smiles at the little cares and ills of life; Its lights and shades, its sunshine and its showers; As at a dream that charmed her vacant hours! Oft may the spirits of the dead descend To watch the silent slumbers of a friend; To hover round his evening walk unseen, And hold sweet converse on the dusky green; To hail the spot where first their friendship grew, And heaven and nature opened to their view! Oft, when he trims his cheerful hearth, and sees A smiling circle emulous to please; There may these gentle guests delight to dwell, And bless the scene they loved in life so well! Oh thou! with whom my heart was wont to share From Reason's dawn each pleasure and each care; With whom, alas! I fondly hoped to know The humble walks of happiness below; If thy blest nature now unites above An angel's pity with a brother's love, Still o'er my life preserve thy mild control, Correct my views, and elevate my soul; Grant me thy peace and purity of mind, Devout yet cheerful, active yet resigned; Grant me, like thee, whose heart knew no disguise, Whose blameless wishes never aimed to rise, To meet the changes Time and Chance present, With modest dignity and calm content. When thy last breath, ere Nature sank to rest, Thy meek submission to thy God expressed; When thy last look, ere thought and feeling fled, A mingled gleam of hope and triumph shed; What to thy soul its glad assurance gave, Its hope in death, its triumph o'er the grave? The sweet Remembrance of unblemished youth, The still inspiring voice of Innocence and Truth! Hail, Memory, hail! in thy exhaustless mine From age to age unnumbered treasures shine! Thought and her shadowy brood thy call obey, And Place and Time are subject to thy sway! Thy pleasures most we feel, when most alone; The only pleasures we can call our own. Lighter than air, Hope's summer-visions die, If but a fleeting cloud obscure the sky; If but a beam of sober Reason play, Lo, Fancy's fairy frost-work melts away! But can the wiles of Art, the grasp of Power Snatch the rich relics of a well-spent hour? These, when the trembling spirit wings her flight, Pour round her path a stream of living light; And gild those pure and perfect realms of rest, Where Virtue triumphs, and her sons are blest! AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND. 1798. Villula, ? et pauper agelle, Me tibi, et hos una mecum, quos semper amavi, Commendo. PREFACE. Every reader turns with pleasure to those passages of Horace, and Pope, and Boileau, which describe how they lived and where they dwelt; and which, being interspersed among their satirical writings, derive a secret and irresistible grace from the contrast, and are admirable examples of what in painting is termed repose. We have admittance to Horace at all hours. We enjoy the company and conversation at his table; and his suppers, like Plato's, “non solum in præsentia, sed etiam postero die jucundæ sunt.” But, when we look round as we sit there, we find ourselves in a Sabine farm, and not in a Roman villa. His windows have every charm of prospect; but his furniture might have descended from Cincinnatus; and gems, and pictures, and old marbles, are mentioned by him more than once with a seeming indifference. His English imitator thought and felt, perhaps, more correctly on the subject; and embellished his garden and grotto with great industry and success. But to these alone he solicits our notice. On the ornaments of his house he is silent; and he appears to have reserved all the minuter touches of his pencil for the library, the chapel, and the banqueting-room of Timon. “Le savoir de notre siècle,” says Rousseau, “tend beaucoup plus à détruire qu'à édifier. On censure d'un ton de maitre; pour proposer, il en faut prendre un antre.” It is the design of this Epistle to illustrate the virtue of True Taste; and to show how little she requires to secure, not only the comforts, but even the elegancies of life. True Taste is an excellent Economist. She confines her choice to few objects, and delights in producing great effects by small means: while False Taste is for ever sighing after the new and the rare; and reminds us, in her works, of the Scholar of Apelles, who, not being able to paint his Helen beautiful, determined to make her fine. An Invitation—The Approach to a Villa described—Its Situation— Its few Apartments—Furnished with Casts from the Antique, &amp;c.—The Dining-Room—The Library—A Cold-bath—A Winter-walk—A Summer-walk—The Invitation renewed—Conclusion. When, with a Réaumur's skill, thy curious mind Has classed the insect-tribes of humankind, Each with its busy hum, or gilded wing, Its subtle web-work, or its venomed sting; Let me, to claim a few unvalued hours, Point out the green lane rough with fern and flowers; The sheltered gate that opens to my field, And the white front thro' mingling elms revealed. In vain, alas, a village-friend invites To simple comforts and domestic rites, When the gay months of Carnival resume Their annual round of glitter and perfume; When London hails thee to its splendid mart, Its hives of sweets and cabinets of art; And, lo, majestic as thy manly song, Flows the full tide of human life along. Still must my partial pencil love to dwell On the home-prospects of my hermit-cell; The mossy pales that skirt the orchard-green, Here hid by shrub-wood, there by glimpses seen; And the brown path-way, that, with careless flow, Sinks, and is lost among the trees below. Still must it trace (the flattering tints forgive) Each fleeting charm that bids the landscape live. Oft o'er the mead, at pleasing distance, pass Browsing the hedge by fits the panniered ass; The idling shepherd-boy, with rude delight, Whistling his dog to mark the pebble's flight; And in her kerchief blue the cottage-maid, With brimming pitcher from the shadowy glade. Far to the south a mountain-vale retires, Rich in its groves, and glens, and village spires; Its upland-lawns, and cliffs with foliage hung, Its wizard-stream, nor nameless nor unsung: And through the various year, the various day, What scenes of glory burst, and melt away! When April-verdure springs in Grosvenor-square, And the furred Beauty comes to winter there, She bids old Nature mar the plan no more; Yet still the seasons circle as before. Ah, still as soon the young Aurora plays, Tho' moons and flam beaux trail their broadest blaze; As soon the sky-lark pours his matin-song, Tho' Evening lingers at the Masque so long. There let her strike with momentary ray, As tapers shine their little lives away; There let her practise from herself to steal, And look the happiness she does not feel; The ready smile and bidden blush employ At Faro-routs that dazzle to destroy; Fan with affected ease the essenced air, And lisp of fashions with unmeaning stare. Be thine to meditate an humbler flight, When morning fills the fields with rosy light; Be thine to blend, nor thine a vulgar aim, Repose with dignity, with Quiet fame. Here no state-chambers in long line unfold, Bright with broad mirrors, rough with fretted gold; Yet modest ornament, with use combined, Attracts the eye to exercise the mind. Small change of scene, small space his home requires, Who leads a life of satisfied desires. What tho' no marble breathes, no canvass glows, From every point a ray of genius flows! Be mine to bless the more mechanic skill, That stamps, renews, and multiplies at will; And cheaply circulates, thro' distant climes, The fairest relics of the purest times. Here from the mould to conscious being start Those finer forms, the miracles of art; Here chosen gems, imprest on sulphur, shine, That slept for ages in a second mine; And here the faithful graver dares to trace A Michael's grandeur, and a Raphael's grace! Thy gallery, Florence, gilds my humble walls; And my low roof the Vatican recalls! Soon as the morning-dream my pillow flies, To waking sense what brighter visions rise! O mark! again the coursers of the Sun, At Guido's call, their round of glory run! Again the rosy Hours resume their flight, Obscured and lost in floods of golden light! But could thine erring friend so long forget (Sweet source of pensive joy and fond regret) That here its warmest hues the pencil flings, Lo! here the lost restores, the absent brings; And still the Few best loved and most revered Rise round the board their social smile endeared? Selected shelves shall claim thy studious hours; There shall thy ranging mind be fed on flowers! There, while the shaded lamp's mild lustre streams, Read ancient books, or dream inspiring dreams; And, when a sage's bust arrests thee there, Pause, and his features with his thoughts compare. —Ah, most that Art my grateful rapture calls, Which breathes a soul into the silent walls; Which gathers round the Wise of every Tongue, All on whose words departed nations hung; Still prompt to charm with many a converse sweet; Guides in the world, companions in retreat! Tho' my thatched bath no rich mosaic knows, A limpid spring with unfelt current flows. Emblem of Life! which, still as we survey, Seems motionless, yet ever glides away! The shadowy walls record, with Attic art, The strength and beauty which its waves impart. Here Thetis, bending, with a mother's fears Dips her dear boy, whose pride restrains his tears. There Venus, rising, shrinks with sweet surprise, As her fair self reflected seems to rise! Far from the joyless glare, the maddening strife, And all the dull impertinence of life, These eyelids open to the rising ray, And close, when Nature bids, at close of day. Here, at the dawn, the kindling landscape glows; There noon-day levees call from faint repose. Here the flushed wave flings back the parting light; There glimmering lamps anticipate the night. When from his classic dreams the student steals, Amid the buzz of crowds, the whirl of wheels, To muse unnoticed—while around him press The meteor-forms of equipage and dress; Alone, in wonder lost, he seems to stand A very stranger in his native land! And (tho' perchance of current coin possest, And modern phrase by living lips exprest) Like those blest Youths, forgive the fabling page, Whose blameless lives deceived a twilight age, Spent in sweet slumbers; till the miner's spade Unclosed the cavern, and the morning played. Ah, what their strange surprise, their wild delight! New arts of life, new manners meet their sight! In a new world they wake, as from the dead; Yet doubt the trance dissolved, the vision fled! O come, and, rich in intellectual wealth, Blend thought with exercise, with knowledge health; Long, in this sheltered scene of lettered talk, With sober step repeat the pensive walk; Nor scorn, when graver triflings fail to please, The cheap amusements of a mind at ease; Here every care in sweet oblivion cast, And many an idle hour—not idly passed. No tuneful echoes, ambushed at my gate, Catch the blest accents of the wise and great. Vain of its various page, no Album breathes The sigh that Friendship or the Muse bequeathes. Yet some good Genii o'er my hearth preside, Oft the far friend, with secret spell, to guide; And there I trace, when the grey evening lours, A silent chronicle of happier hours! When Christmas revels in a world of snow, And bids her berries blush, her carols flow; His spangling shower when Frost the wizard flings; Or, borne in ether blue, on viewless wings, O'er the white pane his silvery foliage weaves, And gems with icicles the sheltering eaves; —Thy muffled friend his nectarine-wall pursues, What time the sun the yellow crocus woos, Screened from the arrowy North; and duly hies To meet the morning-rumour as it flies; To range the murmuring market-place, and view The motley groups that faithful Teniers drew. When Spring bursts forth in blossoms thro' the vale, And her wild music triumphs on the gale, Oft with my book I muse from stile to stile; Oft in my porch the listless noon beguile, Framing loose numbers, till declining day Thro' the green trellis shoots a crimson ray; Till the West-wind leads on the twilight hours, And shakes the fragrant bells of closing flowers. Nor boast, O Choisy, seat of soft delight, The secret charm of thy voluptuous night. Vain is the blaze of wealth, the pomp of power! Lo, here, attendant on the shadowy hour, Thy closet-supper, served by hands unseen, Sheds, like an evening-star, its ray serene, To hail our coming. Not a step profane Dares, with rude sound, the cheerful rite restrain; And, while the frugal banquet glows revealed, Pure and unbought—the natives of my field; While blushing fruits thro' scattered leaves invite, Still clad in bloom, and veiled in azure light;— With wine, as rich in years as Horace sings, With water, clear as his own fountain flings, The shifting side-board plays its humbler part, Beyond the triumphs of a Loriot's art. Thus, in this calm recess, so richly fraught With mental light, and luxury of thought, My life steals on; (O could it blend with thine!) Careless my course, yet not without design. So thro' the vales of Loire the bee-hives glide, The light raft dropping with the silent tide; So, till the laughing scenes are lost in night, The busy people wing their various flight, Culling unnumbered sweets from nameless flowers, That scent the vineyard in its purple hours. Rise, ere the watch-relieving clarions play, Caught thro' St. James's groves at blush of day; Ere its full voice the choral anthem flings Thro' trophied tombs of heroes and of kings. Haste to the tranquil shade of learned ease, Tho' skilled alike to dazzle and to please; Tho' each gay scene be searched with anxious eye, Nor thy shut door be passed without a sigh. If, when this roof shall know thy friend no more, Some, formed like thee, should once, like thee, explore; Invoke the lares of his loved retreat, And his lone walks imprint with pilgrim-feet; Then be it said, (as, vain of better days, Some gray domestic prompts the partial praise,) “Unknown he lived, unenvied, not unblest; Reason his guide, and Happiness his guest. In the clear mirror of his moral page We trace the manners of a purer age. His soul, with thirst of genuine glory fraught, Scorned the false lustre of licentious thought. —One fair asylum from the world he knew, One chosen seat, that charms with various view! Who boasts of more (believe the serious strain) Sighs for a home, and sighs, alas! in vain. Thro' each he roves, the tenant of a day, And, with the swallow, wings the year away!” THE VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS. 1812. Chi se'tu, che vieni—? Da me stesso non vegno. Dante. PREFACE. The following Poem (or, to speak more properly, what remains of it) has here and there a lyrical turn of thought and expression. It is sudden in its transitions, and full of historical allusions; leaving much to be imagined by the reader. The subject is a voyage the most memorable in the annals of mankind. Columbus was a person of extraordinary virtue and piety, acting, as he conceived, under the sense of a divine impulse; and his achievement the discovery of a New World, the inhabitants of which were shut out from the light of Revelation, and given up, as they believed, to the dominion of malignant spirits. Many of the incidents will now be thought extravagant; yet they were once perhaps received with something more than indulgence. It was an age of miracles; and who can say that among the venerable legends in the library of the Escurial, or the more authentic records which fill the great chamber in the Archivo of Seville, and which relate entirely to the deep tragedy of America, there are no volumes that mention the marvellous things here described? Indeed the story, as already told throughout Europe, admits of no heightening. Such was the religious enthusiasm of the early writers, that the Author had only to transfuse it into his verse; and he appears to have done little more; though some of the circumstances, which he alludes to as well-known, have long ceased to be so. By using the language of that day, he has called up Columbus “in his habit as he lived;” and the authorities, such as exist, are carefully given by the Translator. THE ARGUMENT. Columbus, having wandered from kingdom to kingdom, at length obtains three ships and sets sail on the Atlantic. The compass alters from its ancient direction; the wind becomes constant and unremitting; night and day he advances, till he is suddenly stopped in his course by a mass of vegetation, extending as far as the eye can reach, and assuming the appearance of a country overwhelmed by the sea. Alarm and despondence on board. He resigns himself to the care of Heaven, and proceeds on his voyage. Meanwhile the deities of America assemble in council; and one of the Zemi, the gods of the islanders, announces his approach. “In vain,” says he, “have we guarded the Atlantic for ages. A mortal has baffled our power; nor will our votaries arm against him. Yours are a sterner race. Hence; and, while we have recourse to stratagem, do you array the nations round your altars, and prepare for an exterminating war.” They disperse while he is yet speaking; and, in the shape of a Condor, he directs his flight to the fleet. His journey described. He arrives there. A panic. A mutiny. Columbus restores order; continues on his voyage; and lands in a New World. Ceremonies of the first interview. Rites of hospitality. The ghost of Cazziva. Two months pass away, and an Angel, appearing in a dream to Columbus, thus addresses him: “Return to Europe; though your Adversaries, such is the will of Heaven, shall let loose the hurricane against you. A little while shall they triumph; insinuating themselves into the hearts of your followers, and making the World, which you came to bless, a scene of blood and slaughter. Yet is there cause for rejoicing. Your work is done. The cross of Christ is planted here; and, in due time, all things shall be made perfect!” INSCRIBED ON THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT. Unclasp me, Stranger; and unfold, With trembling care, my leaves of gold, Rich in Gothic portraiture— If yet, alas, a leaf endure. In Rábida's monastic fane I cannot ask, and ask in vain. The language of Castile I speak; Mid many an Arab, many a Greek, Old in the days of Charlemain; When minstrel-music wandered round, And Science, waking, blessed the sound. No earthly thought has here a place, The cowl let down on every face; Yet here, in consecrated dust, Here would I sleep, if sleep I must. From Genoa when Columbus came, (At once her glory and her shame) 'Twas here he caught the holy flame. 'Twas here the generous vow he made; His banners on the altar laid. Here, tempest-worn and desolate, A Pilot, journeying thro' the wild, Stopt to solicit at the gate A pittance for his child. 'Twas here, unknowing and unknown, He stood upon the threshold-stone. But hope was his—a faith sublime, That triumphs over place and time; And here, his mighty labour done, And his course of glory run, Awhile as more than man he stood, So large the debt of gratitude! One hallowed morn, methought, I felt As if a soul within me dwelt! But who arose and gave to me The sacred trust I keep for thee, And in his cell at even-tide Knelt before the cross and died— Inquire not now. His name no more Glimmers on the chancel-floor, Near the lights that ever shine Before St. Mary's blessed shrine. To me one little hour devote, And lay thy staff and scrip beside thee; Read in the temper that he wrote, And may his gentle spirit guide thee! My leaves forsake me, one by one; The book-worm thro' and thro' has gone. Oh haste—unclasp me, and unfold; The tale within was never told! CANTO I. NIGHT—COLUMBUS ON THE ATLANTIC—THE VARIATION OF THE COMPASS, &amp;C. Say who, when age on age had rolled away, And still, as sunk the golden Orb of day, The seaman watched him, while he lingered here, With many a wish to follow, many a fear, And gazed and gazed and wondered where he went, So bright his path, so glorious his descent, Who first adventured—In his birth obscure, Yet born to build a Fame that should endure, Who the great secret of the Deep possessed, And, issuing through the portals of the West, Fearless, resolved, with every sail unfurled, Planted his standard on the Unknown World? Him, by the Paynim bard descried of yore, And ere his coming sung on either shore, Him could not I exalt—by Heaven designed To lift the veil that covered half mankind! Yet, ere I die, I would fulfil my vow; Praise cannot wound his generous spirit now. 'Twas night. The Moon, o'er the wide wave, disclosed Her awful face; and Nature's self reposed; When, slowly rising in the azure sky, Three white sails shone—but to no mortal eye, Entering a boundless sea. In slumber cast, The very ship-boy, on the dizzy mast, Half breathed his orisons! Alone unchanged, Calmly, beneath, the great Commander ranged, Thoughtful not sad; and, as the planet grew, His noble form, wrapt in his mantle blue, Athwart the deck a deepening shadow threw. “Thee hath it pleased—Thy will be done!” he said, Then sought his cabin; and, their garments spread, Around him lay the sleeping as the dead, When, by his lamp to that mysterious Guide, On whose still counsels all his hopes relied, That Oracle to man in mercy given, Whose voice is truth, whose wisdom is from heaven, Who over sands and seas directs the stray, And, as with God's own finger, points the way, He turned; but what strange thoughts perplexed his soul, When, lo, no more attracted to the Pole, The Compass, faithless as the circling vane, Fluttered and fixed, fluttered and fixed again! At length, as by some unseen Hand imprest, It sought with trembling energy—the West! “Ah no!” he cried, and calmed his anxious brow. “Ill, nor the signs of ill, 'tis thine to show; Thine but to lead me where I wished to go!” Columbus erred not. In that awful hour, Sent forth to save, and girt with Godlike power, And glorious as the regent of the sun, An Angel came! He spoke, and it was done! He spoke, and, at his call, a mighty Wind, Not like the fitful blast, with fury blind, But deep, majestic, in its destined course, Sprung with unerring, unrelenting force, From the bright East. Tides duly ebbed and flowed; Stars rose and set; and new horizons glowed: Yet still it blew! As with primeval sway Still did its ample spirit, night and day, Move on the waters!—All, resigned to Fate, Folded their arms and sate; and seemed to wait Some sudden change; and sought, in chill suspense, New spheres of being, and new modes of sense; As men departing, though not doomed to die, And midway on their passage to eternity. CANTO II. THE VOYAGE CONTINUED. What vast foundations in the Abyss are there, As of a former world? Is it not where Atlantic kings their barbarous pomp displayed; Sunk into darkness with the realms they swayed, When towers and temples, thro' the closing wave, A glimmering ray of ancient splendour gave— And we shall rest with them.—Or are we thrown” (Each gazed on each, and all exclaimed as one,) “Where things familiar cease and strange begin, All progress barred to those without, within? —Soon is the doubt resolved. Arise, behold— We stop to stir no more ... nor will the tale be told.” The pilot smote his breast; the watchman cried “Land!” and his voice in faltering accents died. At once the fury of the prow was quelled; And (whence or why from many an age withheld) Shrieks, not of men, were mingling in the blast; And armed shapes of god-like stature passed! Slowly along the evening-sky they went, As on the edge of some vast battlement; Helmet and shield, and spear and gonfalon Streaming a baleful light that was not of the sun! Long from the stern the great Adventurer gazed With awe not fear; then high his hands he raised. “Thou All-supreme ... in goodness as in power, Who, from his birth to this eventful hour, Hast led thy servant over land and sea, Confessing Thee in all, and all in Thee, Oh still”—He spoke, and lo, the charm accurst Fled whence it came, and the broad barrier burst! A vain illusion! (such as mocks the eyes Of fearful men, when mountains round them rise From less than nothing) nothing now beheld, But scattered sedge—repelling, and repelled! And once again that valiant company Right onward came, ploughing the Unknown Sea. Already borne beyond the range of thought, With Light divine, and Truth Immortal fraught, From world to world their steady course they keep, Swift as the winds along the waters sweep, Mid the mute nations of the purple deep. —And now the sound of harpy-wings they hear; Now less and less, as vanishing in fear! And see, the heavens bow down, the waters rise, And, rising, shoot in columns to the skies, That stand—and still, when they proceed, retire, As in the Desert burned the sacred fire; Moving in silent majesty, till Night Descends, and shuts the vision from their sight. CANTO III. AN ASSEMBLY OF EVIL SPIRITS. Tho' changed my cloth of gold for amice grey— In my spring-time, when every month was May, With hawk and hound I coursed away the hour, Or sung my roundelay in lady's bower. And tho' my world be now a narrow cell, (Renounced for ever all I loved so well,) Tho' now my head be bald, my feet be bare, And scarce my knees sustain my book of prayer, Oh I was there, one of that gallant crew, And saw—and wondered whence his Power He drew, Yet little thought, tho' by his side I stood, Of his great Foes in earth and air and flood, Then uninstructed.—But my sand is run, And the Night coming ... and my Task not done!.. 'Twas in the deep, immeasurable cave Of Andes, echoing to the Southern wave, Mid pillars of Basalt, the work of fire, That, giant-like, to upper day aspire, 'Twas there that now, as wont in heaven to shine, Forms of angelic mould and grace divine Assembled. All, exiled the realms of rest, In vain the sadness of their souls suppressed; Yet of their glory many a scattered ray Shot thro' the gathering shadows of decay. Each moved a God; and all, as Gods, possessed One half the globe; from pole to pole confessed! Oh could I now—but how in mortal verse— Their numbers, their heroic deeds rehearse! These in dim shrines and barbarous symbols reign, Where Plata and Maragnon meet the Main. Those the wild hunter worships as he roves, In the green shade of Chili's fragrant groves; Or warrior-tribes with rites of blood implore, Whose night-fires gleam along the sullen shore Of Huron or Ontario, inland seas, What time the song of death is in the breeze! 'Twas now in dismal pomp and order due, While the vast concave flashed with lightnings blue, On shining pavements of metallic ore, That many an age the fusing sulphur bore, They held high council. All was silence round, When, with a voice most sweet yet most profound, A sovereign Spirit burst the gates of night, And from his wings of gold shook drops of liquid light! Merion, commissioned with his host to sweep From age to age the melancholy deep! Chief of the Zemi, whom the Isles obeyed, By Ocean severed from a world of shade. I. “Prepare, again prepare, Thus o'er the soul the thrilling accents came, “Thrones to resign for lakes of living flame, And triumph for despair. He, on whose call afflicting thunders wait, Has willed it; and his will is fate! In vain the legions, emulous to save, Hung in the tempest o'er the troubled main; Turned each presumptuous prow that broke the wave, And dashed it on its shores again. All is fulfilled! Behold, in close array, What mighty banners stream in the bright track of day! II. ‘No voice as erst shall in the desert rise; Nor ancient, dread solemnities With scorn of death the trembling tribes inspire. Wreaths for the Conqueror's brow the victims bind! Yet, tho' we fled yon firmament of fire, Still shall we fly, all hope of rule resigned?” He spoke; and all was silence, all was night! Each had already winged his formidable flight. CANTO IV. THE VOYAGE CONTINUED. Ah, why look back, tho' all is left behind? No sounds of life are stirring in the wind.— And you, ye birds, winging your passage home, How blest ye are!—We know not where we roam. We go,” they cried, “go to return no more; Nor ours, alas, the transport to explore A human footstep on a desert shore!” —Still, as beyond this mortal life impelled By some mysterious energy, He held His everlasting course. Still self-possessed, High on the deck He stood, disdaining rest; (His amber chain the only badge he bore, His mantle blue such as his fathers wore) Fathomed, with searching hand, the dark profound, And scattered hope and glad assurance round; Tho' like some strange portentous dream, the Past Still hovered, and the cloudless sky o'ercast. At day-break might the Caravels be seen, Chasing their shadows o'er the deep serene; Their burnished prows lashed by the sparkling tide, Their green-cross standards waving far and wide. And now once more to better thoughts inclined, The sea-man, mounting, clamoured in the wind. The soldier told his tales of love and war; The courtier sung—sung to his gay guitar. Round, at Primero, sate a whiskered band; So Fortune smiled, careless of sea or land! Leon, Montalvan, (serving side by side; Two with one soul—and, as they lived, they died) Vasco, the brave, thrice found among the slain, Thrice, and how soon, up and in arms again, As soon to wish he had been sought in vain, Chained down in Fez, beneath the bitter thong, To the hard bench and heavy oar so long! Albert of Florence, who, at twilight-time, In my rapt ear poured Dante's tragic rhyme, Screened by the sail as near the mast we lay, Our nights illumined by the ocean-spray; And Manfred, who espoused with jewelled ring Young Isabel, then left her sorrowing: Lerma “the generous,” Avila “the proud”; Velasquez, Garcia, thro' the echoing crowd Traced by their mirth—from Ebro's classic shore, From golden Tajo, to return no more! CANTO V. THE VOYAGE CONTINUED. Yet who but He undaunted could explore A world of waves, a sea without a shore, Trackless and vast and wild as that revealed When round the Ark the birds of tempest wheeled; When all was still in the destroying hour— No sign of man! no vestige of his power! One at the stern before the hour-glass stood, As 'twere to count the sands; one o'er the flood Gazed for St. Elmo; while another cried “Once more good morrow!” and sate down and sighed. Day, when it came, came only with its light. Though long invoked, 'twas sadder than the night! Look where He would, for ever as He turned, He met the eye of one that inly mourned. Then sunk his generous spirit, and He wept. The friend, the father rose; the hero slept. Palos, thy port, with many a pang resigned, Filled with its busy scenes his lonely mind; The solemn march, the vows in concert given, The bended knees and lifted hands to heaven, The incensed rites, and choral harmonies, The Guardian's blessings mingling with his sighs; While his dear boys—ah, on his neck they hung, And long at parting to his garments clung. Oft in the silent night-watch doubt and fear Broke in uncertain murmurs on his ear. Oft the stern Catalan, at noon of day, Muttered dark threats, and lingered to obey; Tho' that brave Youth—he, whom his courser bore Right thro' the midst, when, fetlock-deep in gore, The great Gonsalvo battled with the Moor, (What time the Alhambra shook—soon to unfold Its sacred courts, and fountains yet untold, Its holy texts and arabesques of gold) Tho' Roldan, sleep and death to him alike, Grasped his good sword and half unsheathed to strike. “Oh born to wander with your flocks,” he cried, “And bask and dream along the mountain-side; To urge your mules, tinkling from hill to hill; Or at the vintage-feast to drink your fill, And strike your castanets, with gipsy-maid Dancing Fandangos in the chestnut shade— Come on,” he cried, and threw his glove in scorn, “Not this your wonted pledge, the brimming horn. Valiant in peace! Adventurous at home! Oh, had ye vowed with pilgrim-staff to roam; Or with banditti sought the sheltering wood, Where mouldering crosses mark the scene of blood!—” He said, he drew; then, at his Master's frown, Sullenly sheathed, plunging the weapon down. CANTO VI. THE FLIGHT OF AN ANGEL OF DARKNESS. War and the Great in War let others sing, Havoc and spoil, and tears and triumphing; The morning-march that flashes to the sun, The feast of vultures when the day is done; And the strange tale of many slain for one! I sing a Man, amid his sufferings here, Who watched and served in humbleness and fear; Gentle to others, to himself severe. Still unsubdued by Danger's varying form, Still, as unconscious of the coming storm, He looked elate; and, with his wonted smile, On the great Ordinance leaning, would beguile The hour with talk. His beard, his mien sublime, Shadowed by Age—by Age before the time From many a sorrow borne in many a clime, Moved every heart. And now in opener skies Stars yet unnamed of purer radiance rise! Stars, milder suns, that love a shade to cast, And on the bright wave fling the trembling mast! Another firmament! the orbs that roll, Singly or clustering, round the Southern pole! Not yet the four that glorify the Night— Ah, how forget when to my ravished sight The Cross shone forth in everlasting light! 'Twas the mid hour, when He, whose accents dread Still wandered through the regions of the dead, (Merion, commissioned with his host to sweep From age to age the melancholy deep) To elude the seraph-guard that watched for man, And mar, as erst, the Eternal's perfect plan, Rose like the Condor, and, at towering height, In pomp of plumage sailed, deepening the shades of night. Roc of the West! to him all empire given! Who bears Axalhua's dragon-folds to heaven; His flight a whirlwind, and, when heard afar, Like thunder, or the distant din of war! Mountains and seas fled backward as he passed O'er the great globe, by not a cloud o'ercast From the Antarctic, from the Land of Fire To where Alaska's wintry wilds retire; From mines of gold, and giant-sons of earth, To grots of ice, and tribes of pigmy birth Who freeze alive, nor, dead, in dust repose, High-hung in forests to the casing snows. Now mid angelic multitudes he flies, That hourly come with blessings from the skies; Wings the blue element, and, borne sublime, Eyes the set sun, gilding each distant clime; Then, like a meteor, shooting to the main, Melts into pure intelligence again. CANTO VII. A MUTINY EXCITED. What tho' Despondence reigned, and wild Affright— Stretched in the midst, and, thro' that dismal night, By his white plume revealed and buskins white, Slept Roldan. When he closed his gay career, Hope fled for ever, and with Hope fled Fear. Blest with each gift indulgent Fortune sends, Birth and its rights, wealth and its train of friends, Star-like he shone! Now beggared and alone, Danger he wooed, and claimed her for his own. O'er him a Vampire his dark wings displayed. 'Twas Merion's self, covering with dreadful shade. He came, and, couched on Roldan's ample breast, Each secret pore of breathing life possessed, Fanning the sleep that seemed his final rest; Then, inly gliding like a subtle flame, Thrice, with a cry that thrilled the mortal frame, Called on the Spirit within. Disdaining flight, Calmly she rose, collecting all her might. Dire was the dark encounter! Long unquelled, Her sacred seat, sovereign and pure, she held. At length the great Foe binds her for his prize, And awful, as in death, the body lies! Not long to slumber! In an evil hour Informed and lifted by the unknown Power, It starts, it speaks! “We live, we breathe no more! The fatal wind blows on the dreary shore! On yonder cliffs beckoning their fellow-prey, The spectres stalk, and murmur at delay! —Yet if thou canst (not for myself I plead! Mine but to follow where 'tis thine to lead) Oh turn and save! To thee, with streaming eyes, To thee each widow kneels, each orphan cries! Who now, condemned the lingering hours to tell, Think and but think of those they loved so well!” All melt in tears! but what can tears avail? These climb the mast, and shift the swelling sail. These snatch the helm; and round me now I hear Smiting of hands, out-cries of grief and fear, (That in the aisles at midnight haunt me still, Turning my lonely thoughts from good to ill) “Were there no graves—none in our land,” they cry, “That thou hast brought us on the deep to die?” Silent with sorrow, long within his cloak His face he muffled—then the Hero spoke. “Generous and brave! when God himself is here, Why shake at shadows in your mid career? He can suspend the laws himself designed, He walks the waters, and the wingèd wind; Himself your guide! and yours the high behest, To lift your voice, and bid a world be blest! And can you shrink? to you, to you consigned The glorious privilege to serve mankind! Oh had I perished, when my failing frame Clung to the shattered oar mid wrecks of flame! —Was it for this I lingered life away, The scorn of Folly, and of Fraud the prey; Bowed down my mind, the gift His bounty gave, At courts a suitor, and to slaves a slave? —Yet in His name whom only we should fear, ('Tis all, all I shall ask, or you shall hear) Grant but three days”—He spoke not uninspired; And each in silence to his watch retired. At length among us came an unknown Voice! “Go, if ye will; and, if ye can, rejoice. Go, with unbidden guests the banquet share. In his own shape shall Death receive you there.” CANTO VIII. LAND DISCOVERED. Twice in the zenith blazed the orb of light; No shade, all sun, insufferably bright! Then the long line found rest—in coral groves Silent and dark, where the sea-lion roves:— And all on deck, kindling to life again, Sent forth their anxious spirits o'er the main. “Oh whence, as wafted from Elysium, whence These perfumes, strangers to the raptured sense? These boughs of gold, and fruits of heavenly hue, Tinging with vermeil light the billows blue? And (thrice, thrice blessed is the eye that spied, The hand that snatched it sparkling in the tide) Whose cunning carved this vegetable bowl, Symbol of social rites, and intercourse of soul?” Such to their grateful ear the gush of springs, Who course the ostrich, as away she wings; Sons of the desert! who delight to dwell 'Mid kneeling camels round the sacred well; Who, ere the terrors of his pomp be passed, Fall to the demon in the redd'ning blast. The sails were furled: with many a melting close, Solemn and slow the evening-anthem rose, Rose to the Virgin. 'Twas the hour of day, When setting suns o'er summer-seas display A path of glory, opening in the west To golden climes, and islands of the blest; And human voices, on the silent air, Went o'er the waves in songs of gladness there! Chosen of Men! 'Twas thine, at noon of night, First from the prow to hail the glimmering light; (Emblem of Truth divine, whose secret ray Enters the soul, and makes the darkness day!) “Pedro! Rodrigo! there, methought, it shone! There—in the west! and now, alas, 'tis gone!— 'Twas all a dream! we gaze and gaze in vain! —But mark and speak not, there it comes again! It moves! what form unseen, what being there With torch-like lustre fires the murky air? His instincts, passions, say, how like our own? Oh! when will day reveal a world unknown?” CANTO IX. THE NEW WORLD. Long on the deep the mists of morning lay, Then rose, revealing, as they rolled away, Half-circling hills, whose everlasting woods Sweep with their sable skirts the shadowy floods: And say, when all, to holy transport given, Embraced and wept as at the gates of Heaven, When one and all of us, repentant, ran, And, on our faces, blessed the wondrous Man; Say, was I then deceived, or from the skies Burst on my ear seraphic harmonies? “Glory to God!” unnumbered voices sung, “Glory to God!” the vales and mountains rung, Voices that hailed Creation's primal morn, And to the shepherds sang a Saviour born. Slowly, bare-headed, thro' the surf we bore The sacred cross, and, kneeling, kissed the shore. But what a scene was there? nymphs of romance, Youths graceful as the Faun, with eager glance, Spring from the glades and down the alleys peep, Then head-long rush, bounding from steep to steep, And clap their hands, exclaiming as they run, “Come and behold the Children of the Sun!” When hark, a signal-shot! The voice, it came Over the sea in darkness and in flame! They saw, they heard; and up the highest hill, As in a picture, all at once were still! Creatures so fair, in garments strangely wrought, From citadels, with Heaven's own thunder fraught, Checked their light footsteps—statue-like they stood, As worshipped forms, the Genii of the Wood! At length the spell dissolves! The warrior's lance Rings on the tortoise with wild dissonance! And see, the regal plumes, the couch of state! Still, where it moves, the wise in council wait! See now borne forth the monstrous mask of gold, And ebon chair of many a serpent-fold; These now exchanged for gifts that thrice surpass The wondrous ring, and lamp, and horse of brass. What long-drawn tube transports the gazer home, Kindling with stars at noon the ethereal dome? 'Tis here: and here circles of solid light Charm with another self the cheated sight; As man to man another self disclose, That now with terror starts, with triumph glows! CANTO X. CORA—LUXURIANT VEGETATION—THE HUMMING-BIRD—THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. Then Cora came, the youngest of her race, And in her hands she hid her lovely face; Yet oft by stealth a timid glance she cast, And now with playful step the Mirror passed, Each bright reflection brighter than the last! And oft behind it flew, and oft before; The more she searched, pleased and perplexed the more! And looked and laughed, and blushed with quick surprise! Her lips all mirth, all ecstasy her eyes! But soon the telescope attracts her view; And lo, her lover in his light canoe Rocking, at noontide, on the silent sea, Before her lies! It cannot, cannot be. Late as he left the shore, she lingered there, Till, less and less, he melted into air!— Sigh after sigh steals from her gentle frame, And say—that murmur—was it not his name? She turns, and thinks; and, lost in wild amaze, Gazes again, and could for ever gaze! Nor can thy flute, Alonso, now excite As in Valencia, when, with fond delight, Francisca, waking, to the lattice flew, So soon to love and to be wretched too! Hers thro' a convent-grate to send her last adieu. —Yet who now comes uncalled; and round and round, And near and nearer flutters to the sound; Then stirs not, breathes not—on enchanted ground? Who now lets fall the flowers she culled to wear When he, who promised, should at eve be there; And faintly smiles, and hangs her head aside The tear that glistens on her cheek to hide? Ah, who but Cora?—till inspired, possessed, At once she springs, and clasps it to her breast! Soon from the bay the mingling crowd ascends, Kindred first met! by sacred instinct Friends! Thro' citron-groves, and fields of yellow maize, Thro' plantain-walks where not a sun-beam plays. Here blue savannas fade into the sky. There forests frown in midnight majesty; Ceiba, and Indian fig, and plane sublime, Nature's first-born, and reverenced by Time! There sits the bird that speaks! there, quivering, rise Wings that reflect the glow of evening skies! Half bird, half fly, the fairy king of flowers Reigns there, and revels thro' the fragrant hours; Gem full of life, and joy, and song divine, Soon in the virgin's graceful ear to shine. 'Twas he that sung, if ancient Fame speaks truth, “Come! follow, follow to the Fount of Youth! I quaff the ambrosial mists that round it rise, Dissolved and lost in dreams of Paradise!” For there called forth, to bless a happier hour, It met the sun in many a rainbow-shower! Murmuring delight, its living waters rolled 'Mid branching palms and amaranths of gold! CANTO XI. EVENING—A BANQUET—THE GHOST OF CAZZIVA. The tamarind closed her leaves; the marmoset Dreamed on his bough, and played the mimic yet. Fresh from the lake the breeze of twilight blew, And vast and deep the mountain-shadows grew; When many a fire-fly, shooting thro' the glade, Spangled the locks of many a lovely maid, Who now danced forth to strew our path with flowers And hymn our welcome to celestial bowers. There odorous lamps adorned the festal rite, And guavas blushed as in the vales of light. There silent sate many an unbidden Guest, Whose steadfast looks a secret dread impressed; Not there forgot the sacred fruit that fed At nightly feasts the Spirits of the Dead, Mingling in scenes that mirth to mortals give, But by their sadness known from those that live. There met, as erst, within the wonted grove, Unmarried girls and youths that died for love! Sons now beheld their ancient sires again; And sires, alas, their sons in battle slain! But whence that sigh? 'Twas from a heart that broke! And whence that voice? As from the grave it spoke! And who, as unresolved the feast to share, Sits half-withdrawn in faded splendour there? 'Tis he of yore, the warrior and the sage, Whose lips have moved in prayer from age to age; Whose eyes, that wandered as in search before, Now on Columbus fixed—to search no more! Cazziva, gifted in his day to know The gathering signs of a long night of woe; Gifted by Those who give but to enslave; No rest in death! no refuge in the grave —With sudden spring as at the shout of war, He flies! and, turning in his flight, from far Glares thro' the gloom like some portentous star! Unseen, unheard! Hence, Minister of Ill! Hence, 'tis not yet the hour! tho' come it will! They that foretold—too soon shall they fulfil; When forth they rush as with the torrent's sweep, And deeds are done that make the Angels weep! Hark, o'er the busy mead the shell proclaims Triumphs, and masques, and high heroic games. And now the old sit round; and now the young Climb the green boughs, the murmuring doves among. Who claims the prize, when winged feet contend; When twanging bows the flaming arrows send? Who stands self-centred in the field of fame, And, grappling, flings to earth a giant's frame? Whilst all, with anxious hearts and eager eyes, Bend as he bends, and, as he rises, rise! And Cora's self, in pride of beauty here, Trembles with grief and joy, and hope and fear! (She who, the fairest, ever flew the first, With cup of balm to quench his burning thirst; Knelt at his head, her fan-leaf in her hand, And hummed the air that pleased him, while she fanned) How blest his lot!—tho', by the Muse unsung, His name shall perish, when his knell is rung. That night, transported, with a sigh I said “'Tis all a dream!”—Now, like a dream, 'tis fled; And many and many a year has passed away, And I alone remain to watch and pray! Yet oft in darkness, on my bed of straw, Oft I awake and think on what I saw! The groves, the birds, the youths, the nymphs recall, And Cora, loveliest, sweetest of them all! CANTO XII. A VISION. Still would I speak of Him before I went, Who amongus a life of sorrow spent, And, dying, left a world his monument; Still, if the time allowed! My Hour draws near; But He will prompt me when I faint with fear. ... Alas, He hears me not! He cannot hear! Twice the Moon filled her silver urn with light. Then from the Throne an Angel winged his flight; He, who unfixed the compass, and assigned O'er the wild waves a pathway to the wind; Who, while approached by none but Spirits pure, Wrought, in his progress thro' the dread obscure, Signs like the ethereal bow—that shall endure! As he descended thro' the upper air, Day broke on day as God himself were there! Before the great Discoverer, laid to rest, He stood, and thus his secret soul addressed. “The wind recalls thee; its still voice obey. Millions await thy coming; hence, away. To thee blest tidings of great joy consigned, Another Nature, and a new Mankind! The vain to dream, the wise to doubt shall cease; Young men be glad, and old depart in peace! Hence! tho' assembling in the fields of air, Now, in a night of clouds, thy Foes prepare To rock the globe with elemental wars, And dash the floods of ocean to the stars; To bid the meek repine, the valiant weep, And Thee restore thy Secret to the Deep! “Not then to leave Thee! to their vengeance cast, Thy heart their aliment, their dire repast! To other eyes shall Mexico unfold Her feathered tapestries, and roofs of gold, To other eyes, from distant cliff descried, Shall the Pacific roll his ample tide; There destined soon rich argosies to ride. Chains thy reward! beyond the Atlantic wave Hung in thy chamber, buried in thy grave! Thy reverend form to time and grief a prey, A spectre wandering in the light of day! “What tho' thy grey hairs to the dust descend, Their scent shall track thee, track thee to the end; Thy sons reproached with their great father's fame, And on his world inscribed another's name! That world a prison-house, full of sights of woe, Where groans burst forth, and tears in torrents flow! These gardens of the sun, sacred to song, By dogs of carnage, howling loud and long, Swept—till the voyager, in the desert air, Starts back to hear his altered accents there! “Not thine the olive, but the sword to bring, Not peace, but war! Yet from these shores shall spring Peace without end; from these, with blood defiled, Spread the pure spirit of thy Master mild! Here, in His train, shall arts and arms attend, Arts to adorn, and arms but to defend. Assembling here, all nations shall be blest; The sad be comforted; the weary rest; Untouched shall drop the fetters from the slave; And He shall rule the world He died to save! “Hence, and rejoice. The glorious work is done. A spark is thrown that shall eclipse the sun! And, tho' bad men shall long thy course pursue, As erst the ravening brood o'er chaos flew, He, whom I serve, shall vindicate his reign; The spoiler spoiled of all; the slayer slain; The tyrant's self, oppressing and opprest, Mid gems and gold unenvied and unblest; While to the starry sphere thy name shall rise, (Not there unsung thy generous enterprise!) Thine in all hearts to dwell—by Fame enshrined With those, the Few, that live but for Mankind; Thine evermore, transcendent happiness! World beyond world to visit and to bless.” [Thy lonely watch-tower, Larenille] On the two last leaves, and written in another hand, are some stanzas in the romance or ballad measure of the Spaniards. The subject is an adventure soon related. Thy lonely watch-tower, Larenille, Had lost the western sun; And loud and long from hill to hill Echoed the evening-gun, When Hernan, rising on his oar, Shot like an arrow from the shore. —“Those lights are on St. Mary's Isle; They glimmer from the sacred pile.” The waves were rough; the hour was late. But soon across the Tinto borne, Thrice he blew the signal-horn, He blew and would not wait. Home by his dangerous path he went; Leaving, in rich habiliment, Two Strangers at the Convent gate. They ascended by steps hewn out in the rock; and, having asked for admittance, were lodged there. Brothers in arms the Guests appeared; The Youngest with a Princely grace! Short and sable was his beard, Thoughtful and wan his face. His velvet cap a medal bore, And ermine fringed his broidered vest; And, ever sparkling on his breast, An image of St. John he wore. The Eldest had a rougher aspect, and there was craft in his eye. He stood a little behind in a long black mantle, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword; and his white hat and white shoes glittered in the moon-shine. “Not here unwelcome, tho' unknown. Enter and rest!” the Friar said. The moon, that thro' the portal shone, Shone on his reverend head. Thro' many a court and gallery dim Slowly he led, the burial-hymn Swelling from the distant choir. But now the holy men retire; The arched cloisters issuing thro', In long long order, two and two. When other sounds had died away, And the waves were heard alone, They entered, tho' unused to pray, Where God was worshipped, night and day. And the dead knelt round in stone; They entered, and from aisle to aisle Wandered with folded arms awhile, Where on his altar-tomb reclined The crosiered Abbot; and the Knight In harness for the Christian fight, His hands in supplication joined;— Then said as in a solemn mood, “Now stand we where Columbus stood!” “Perez, thou good old man,” they cried, “And art thou in thy place of rest?— Tho' in the western world his grave, That other world, the gift he gave, Would ye were sleeping side by side! Of all his friends He loved thee best.” The supper in the chamber done, Much of a Southern Sea they spake, And of that glorious City won Near the setting of the Sun, Throned in a silver lake; Of seven kings in chains of gold And deeds of death by tongue untold, Deeds such as breathed in secret there Had shaken the Confession-chair! The Eldest swore by our Lady, the Youngest by his conscience; while the Franciscan, sitting by in his grey habit, turned away and crossed himself again and again. “Here is a little book,” said he at last, “the work of him in his shroud below. It tells of things you have mentioned; and, were Cortes and Pizarro here, it might perhaps make them reflect for a moment.” The Youngest smiled as he took it into his hand. He read it aloud to his companion with an unfaltering voice; but, when he laid it down, a silence ensued; nor was he seen to smile again that night. “The curse is heavy,” said he at parting, “but Cortes may live to disappoint it.”—“Ay, and Pizarro too!” A circumstance, recorded by Herrera, renders this visit not improbable. “In May, 1528, Cortes arrived unexpectedly at Palos; and, soon after he had landed, he and Pizarro met and rejoiced; and it was remarkable that they should meet, as they were two of the most renowned men in the world.” B. Diaz makes no mention of the interview; but, relating an occurrence that took place at this time in Palos, says, “that Cortes was now absent at Nuestra Señora de la Rábida.” The Convent is within half a league of the town. JACQUELINE. 1813. I. Twas Autumn; thro' Provence had ceased The vintage, and the vintage-feast. The sun had set behind the hill, The moon was up, and all was still, And from the Convent's neighbouring tower The clock had tolled the midnight-hour, When Jacqueline came forth alone, Her kerchief o'er her tresses thrown; A guilty thing and full of fears, Yet ah, how lovely in her tears! She starts, and what has caught her eye? What—but her shadow gliding by? She stops, she pants; with lips apart She listens—to her beating heart! Then, thro' the scanty orchard stealing, The clustering boughs her track concealing, She flies, nor casts a thought behind, But gives her terrors to the wind; Flies from her home, the humble sphere Of all her joys and sorrows here, Her father's house of mountain-stone, And by a mountain-vine o'ergrown. At such an hour in such a night, So calm, so clear, so heavenly bright, Who would have seen, and not confessed It looked as all within were blest? What will not woman, when she loves? Yet lost, alas, who can restore her?— She lifts the latch, the wicket moves; And now the world is all before her. Up rose St. Pierre, when morning shone; —And Jacqueline, his child, was gone! Oh what the madd'ning thought that came? Dishonour coupled with his name! By Condé at Rocroy he stood; By Turenne, when the Rhine ran blood. Two banners of Castile he gave Aloft in Notre Dame to wave; Nor did thy cross, St. Louis, rest Upon a purer, nobler breast. He slung his old sword by his side, And snatched his staff and rushed to save; Then sunk—and on his threshold cried, “Oh lay me in my grave! —Constance! Claudine! where were ye them? But stand not there. Away! away! Thou, Frederic, by thy father stay. Though old, and now forgot of men, Both must not leave him in a day.” Then, and he shook his hoary head, “Unhappy in thy youth!” he said. “Call as thou wilt, thou call'st in vain; No voice sends back thy name again. To mourn is all thou hast to do; Thy play-mate lost, and teacher too.” And who but she could soothe the boy, Or turn his tears to tears of joy? Long had she kissed him as he slept, Long o'er his pillow hung and wept; And, as she passed her father's door, She stood as she would stir no more. But she is gone, and gone for ever! No, never shall they clasp her—never! They sit and listen to their fears; And he, who thro' the breach had led Over the dying and the dead, Shakes if a cricket's cry he hears! Oh! she was good as she was fair. None—none on earth above her! As pure in thought as angels are, To know her was to love her. When little, and her eyes, her voice, Her every gesture said “rejoice,” Her coming was a gladness; And, as she grew, her modest grace, Her down-cast look 'twas heaven to trace, When, shading with her hand her face, She half inclined to sadness. Her voice, whate'er she said, enchanted; Like music to the heart it went. And her dark eyes—how eloquent! Ask what they would, 'twas granted. Her father loved her as his fame; —And Bayard's self had done the same! Soon as the sun the glittering pane On the red floor in diamonds threw, His songs she sung and sung again, Till the last light withdrew. Every day, and all day long, He mused or slumbered to a song. But she is dead to him, to all! Her lute hangs silent on the wall; And on the stairs, and at the door Her fairy-step is heard no more! At every meal an empty chair Tells him that she is not there; She, who would lead him where he went, Charm with her converse while he leant; Or, hovering, every wish prevent; At eve light up the chimney-nook, Lay there his glass within his book; And that small chest of curious mould, (Queen Mab's, perchance, in days of old,) Tusk of elephant and gold; Which, when a tale is long, dispenses Its fragrant dust to drowsy senses. In her who mourned not, when they missed her, The old a child, the young a sister? No more the orphan runs to take From her loved hand the barley-cake. No more the matron in the school Expects her in the hour of rule, To sit amid the elfin brood, Praising the busy and the good. The widow trims her hearth in vain. She comes not—nor will come again. Not now, his little lesson done, With Frederic blowing bubbles in the sun; Nor spinning by the fountain-side, (Some story of the days of old, Barbe Bleue or Chaperon Rouge half-told To him who would not be denied;) Not now, to while an hour away, Gone to the falls in Valombré, Where 'tis night at noon of day; Nor wandering up and down the wood, To all but her a solitude, Where once a wild deer, wild no more, Her chaplet on his antlers wore, And at her bidding stood. II. The day was in the golden west; And, curtained close by leaf and flower, The doves had cooed themselves to rest In Jacqueline's deserted bower; The doves—that still would at her casement peck, And in her walks had ever fluttered round With purple feet and shining neck, True as the echo to the sound. That casement, underneath the trees, Half open to the western breeze, Looked down, enchanting Garonnelle, Thy wild and mulberry-shaded dell, Round which the Alps of Piedmont rose, The blush of sunset on their snows: While, blithe as lark on summer-morn, When green and yellow waves the corn, When harebells blow in every grove, And thrushes sing “I love! I love!” Within (so soon the early rain Scatters, and 'tis fair again; Though many a drop may yet be seen To tell us where a cloud has been) Within lay Frederic, o'er and o'er Building castles on the floor, And feigning, as they grew in size, New troubles and new dangers; With dimpled cheeks and laughing eyes, As he and Fear were strangers. St. Pierre sat by, nor saw nor smiled. His eyes were on his loved Montaigne; But every leaf was turned in vain. For in that hour remorse he felt, And his heart told him he had dealt Unkindly with his child. A father may awhile refuse; But who can for another choose? When her young blushes had revealed The secret from herself concealed, Why promise what her tears denied, That she should be De Courcy's bride? —Wouldst thou, presumptuous as thou art, O'er Nature play the tyrant's part, And with the hand compel the heart? Oh rather, rather hope to bind The ocean-wave, the mountain-wind; Or fix thy foot upon the ground To stop the planet rolling round. The light was on his face; and there You might have seen the passions driven— Resentment, Pity, Hope, Despair— Like clouds across the face of Heaven. Now he sighed heavily; and now, His hand withdrawing from his brow, He shut the volume with a frown, To walk his troubled spirit down: —When (faithful as that dog of yore Who wagged his tail and could no more) Manchon, who long had snuffed the ground, And sought and sought, but never found, Leapt up and to the casement flew, And looked and barked, and vanished thro'. “'Tis Jacqueline! 'Tis Jacqueline!” Her little brother laughing cried. “I know her by her kirtle green, She comes along the mountain-side; Now turning by the traveller's seat,— Now resting in the hermit's cave,— Now kneeling, where the pathways meet, To the cross on the stranger's grave. And, by the soldier's cloak, I know (There, there along the ridge they go) D'Arey, so gentle and so brave! Look up—why will you not?” he cries, His rosy hands before his eyes; For on that incense-breathing eve The sun shone out, as loth to leave. “See—to the rugged rock she clings! She calls, she faints, and D'Arcy springs; D'Arcy so dear to us, to all; Who, for you told me on your knee, When in the fight he saw you fall, Saved you for Jacqueline and me!” And true it was! And true the tale. When did she sue, and not prevail? Five years before—it was the night That on the village-green they parted, The lilied banners streaming bright O'er maids and mothers broken-hearted; The drum—it drowned the last adieu, When D'Arcy from the crowd she drew. “One charge I have, and one alone, Nor that refuse to take, My father—if not for his own, Oh for his daughter's sake!” Inly he vowed—'twas all he could; And went and sealed it with his blood. Nor can ye wonder. When a child, And in her playfulness she smiled, Up many a ladder-path he guided Where meteor-like the chamois glided, Thro' many a misty grove. They loved—but under Friendship's name; And Reason, Virtue fanned the flame, Till in their houses Discord came, And 'twas a crime to love. Then what was Jacqueline to do? Her father's angry hours she knew, And when to soothe, and when persuade; But now her path De Courcy crossed, Led by his falcon through the glade— He turned, beheld, admired the maid; And all her little arts were lost! De Courcy, Lord of Argentière! Thy poverty, thy pride, St. Pierre, Thy thirst for vengeance sought the snare. The day was named, the guests invited; The bride-groom, at the gate, alighted; When up the windings of the dell A pastoral pipe was heard to swell, And lo, an humble Piedmontese, Whose music might a lady please, This message thro' the lattice bore, (She listened, and her trembling frame Told her at once from whom it came) “Oh let us fly—to part no more!” III. That morn ('twas in Ste. Julienne's cell, As at Ste. Julienne's sacred well Their dream of love began) That morn, ere many a star was set, Their hands had on the altar met Before the holy man. —And now, her strength, her courage spent, And more than half a penitent, She comes along the path she went. And now the village gleams at last; The woods, the golden meadows passed, Where, when, Toulouse, thy splendour shone, The Troubadour, from grove to grove, Chanting some roundelay of love, Would wander till the day was gone. “All will be well, my Jacqueline! Oh tremble not—but trust in me. The Good are better made by Ill, As odours crushed are sweeter still; And gloomy as thy past has been, Bright shall thy future be!” So saying, thro' the fragrant shade Gently along he led the Maid, While Manchon round and round her played: And, as that silent glen they leave, Where by the spring the pitchers stand, Where glow-worms light their little lamps at eve, And fairies revel as in fairy-land, (When Lubin calls, and Blanche steals round, Her finger on her lip, to see; And many an acorn-cup is found Under the greenwood tree) From every cot above, below, They gather as they go— Sabot, and coif, and collerette, The housewife's prayer, the grandam's blessing! Girls that adjust their locks of jet, And look and look and linger yet, The lovely bride caressing; Babes that had learnt to lisp her name, And heroes he had led to fame. But what felt D'Arcy, when at length Her father's gate was open flung? Ah, then he found a giant's strength; For round him, as for life, she clung! And when, her fit of weeping o'er, Onward they moved a little space, And saw an old man sitting at the door, Saw his wan cheek, and sunken eye That seemed to gaze on vacancy, Then, at the sight of that beloved face, At once to fall upon his neck she flew; But—not encouraged—back she drew, And trembling stood in dread suspense, Her tears her only eloquence! All, all—the while—an awful distance keeping; Save D'Arcy, who nor speaks nor stirs; And one, his little hand in hers, Who weeps to see his sister weeping. Then Jacqueline the silence broke. She clasped her father's knees and spoke, Her brother kneeling too; While D'Arcy as before looked on, Tho' from his manly cheek was gone Its natural hue. “His praises from your lips I heard, Till my fond heart was won; And, if in aught his Sire has erred, Oh turn not from the Son!— She, whom in joy, in grief you nursed; Who climbed and called you father first, By that dear name conjures— On her you thought—but to be kind! When looked she up, but you inclined? These things, for ever in her mind, Oh are they gone from yours? Two kneeling at your feet behold; One—one how young;—nor yet the other old. Oh spurn them not—nor look so cold— If Jacqueline be cast away, Her bridal be her dying day. —Well, well might she believe in you! She listened, and she found it true.” He shook his aged locks of snow; And twice he turned, and rose to go. She hung; and was St. Pierre to blame, If tears and smiles together came? “Oh no—begone! I'll hear no more.” But, as he spoke, his voice relented. “That very look thy mother wore When she implored, and old Le Roc consented. True, I have erred and will atone; For still I love him as my own. And now, in my hands, yours with his unite; A father's blessing on your heads alight! . . . Nor let the least be sent away. All hearts shall sing ‘Adieu to sorrow!’ St. Pierre has found his child to-day; And old and young shall dance to-morrow.” Had Louis then before the gate dismounted, Lost in the chase at set of sun; Like Henry when he heard recounted The generous deeds himself had done, (What time the miller's maid Colette Sung, while he supped, her chansonnette) Then—when St. Pierre addressed his village-train, Then had the monarch with a sigh confessed A joy by him unsought and unpossessed, —Without it what are all the rest?— To love, and to be loved again. HUMAN LIFE. 1819. THE ARGUMENT. Introduction—Ringing of Bells in a neighbouring Village on the Birth of an Heir—General Reflections on Human Life—The Subject proposed—Childhood—Youth—Manhood—Love—Marriage— Domestic Happiness and Affliction—War—Peace—Civil Dissension —Retirement from Active Life—Old Age and its Enjoyments— Conclusion. The lark has sung his carol in the sky; The bees have hummed their noon-tide harmony. Still in the vale the village-bells ring round, Still in Llewellyn-hall the jests resound: For now the caudle-cup is circling there, Now, glad at heart, the gossips breathe their prayer, And, crowding, stop the cradle to admire The babe, the sleeping image of his sire. A few short years—and then these sounds shall hail The day again, and gladness fill the vale; So soon the child a youth, the youth a man, Eager to run the race his fathers ran. Then the huge ox shall yield the broad sir-loin; The ale now brewed, in floods of amber shine: And, basking in the chimney's ample blaze, Mid many a tale told of his boyish days, The nurse shall cry, of all her ills beguiled, “'Twas on these knees he sate so oft and smiled.” And soon again shall music swell the breeze; Soon, issuing forth, shall glitter through the trees Vestures of nuptial white; and hymns be sung, And violets scattered round; and old and young, In every cottage-porch with garlands green, Stand still to gaze, and, gazing, bless the scene; While, her dark eyes declining, by his side Moves in her virgin-veil the gentle bride. And once, alas, nor in a distant hour, Another voice shall come from yonder tower; When in dim chambers long black weeds are seen, And weepings heard where only joy has been; When by his children borne, and from his door Slowly departing to return no more, He rests in holy earth with them that went before. And such is Human Life; so, gliding on, It glimmers like a meteor, and is gone! Yet is the tale, brief though it be, as strange, As full, methinks, of wild and wondrous change, As any that the wandering tribes require, Stretched in the desert round their evening-fire; As any sung of old in hall or bower To minstrel-harps at midnight's witching hour! Born in a trance, we wake, observe, inquire; And the green earth, the azure sky admire. Of Elfin-size—for ever as we run, We cast a longer shadow in the sun! And now a charm, and now a grace is won! We grow in stature, and in wisdom too! And, as new scenes, new objects rise to view, Think nothing done while aught remains to do. Yet, all forgot, how oft the eye-lids close, And from the slack hand drops the gathered rose! How oft, as dead, on the warm turf we lie, While many an emmet comes with curious eye; And on her nest the watchful wren sits by! Nor do we speak or move, or hear or see; So like what once we were, and once again shall be! And say, how soon, where, blithe as innocent, The boy at sun-rise carolled as he went, An aged pilgrim on his staff shall lean, Tracing in vain the footsteps o'er the green; The man himself how altered, not the scene! Now journeying home with nothing but the name; Way-worn and spent, another and the same! No eye observes the growth or the decay. To-day we look as we did yesterday; And we shall look to-morrow as to-day. Yet while the loveliest smiles, her locks grow grey! And in her glass could she but see the face She'll see so soon among another race, How would she shrink!—Returning from afar, After some years of travel, some of war, Within his gate Ulysses stood unknown Before a wife, a father, and a son! And such is Human Life, the general theme. Ah, what at best, what but a longer dream? Though with such wild romantic wanderings fraught, Such forms in Fancy's richest colouring wrought That, like the visions of a love-sick brain, Who would not sleep and dream them o'er again? Our pathway leads but to a precipice; And all must follow, fearful as it is! From the first step 'tis known; but—No delay! On, 'tis decreed. We tremble and obey. A thousand ills beset us as we go. —“Still, could I shun the fatal gulf”—Ah, no, 'Tis all in vain—the inexorable Law! Nearer and nearer to the brink we draw. Verdure springs up; and fruits and flowers invite, And groves and fountains—all things that delight. Oh, I would stop, and linger if I might!”— We fly; no resting for the foot we find; All dark before, all desolate behind! At length the brink appears—but one step more! We faint—On, on!—we falter—and 'tis o'er! Yet here high passions, high desires unfold, Prompting to noblest deeds; here links of gold Bind soul to soul; and thoughts divine inspire A thirst unquenchable, a holy fire That will not, cannot but with life expire! Now, seraph-winged, among the stars we soar; Now distant ages, like a day, explore, And judge the act, the actor now no more; Or, in a thankless hour condemned to live, From others claim what these refuse to give, And dart, like Milton, an unerring eye Through the dim curtains of Futurity. Wealth, Pleasure, Ease, all thought of self resigned, What will not Man encounter for Mankind? Behold him now unbar the prison-door, And, lifting Guilt, Contagion from the floor, To Peace and Health, and Light and Life restore; Now in Thermopylæ remain to share Death—nor look back, nor turn a footstep there, Leaving his story to the birds of air; And now like Pylades (in Heaven they write Names such as his in characters of light) Long with his friend in generous enmity, Pleading, insisting in his place to die! Do what he will, he cannot realize Half he conceives—the glorious vision flies. Go where he may, he cannot hope to find The truth, the beauty pictured in his mind. But if by chance an object strike the sense, The faintest shadow of that Excellence, Passions, that slept, are stirring in his frame; Thoughts undefined, feelings without a name! And some, not here called forth, may slumber on Till this vain pageant of a world is gone; Lying too deep for things that perish here, Waiting for life—but in a nobler sphere! Look where he comes! Rejoicing in his birth, A while he moves as in a heaven on earth! Sun, moon, and stars—the land, the sea, the sky To him shine out as in a galaxy! But soon 'tis past—the light has died away! With him it came (it was not of the day) And he himself diffused it, like the stone That sheds awhile a lustre all its own, Making night beautiful. 'Tis past, 'tis gone, And in his darkness as he journeys on, Nothing revives him but the blessed ray That now breaks in, nor ever knows decay, Sent from a better world to light him on his way. How great the Mystery! Let others sing The circling Year, the promise of the Spring, The Summer's glory, and the rich repose Of Autumn, and the Winter's silvery snows. Man through the changing scene let us pursue, Himself how wondrous in his changes too! Not Man, the sullen savage in his den; But Man called forth in fellowship with men; Schooled and trained up to Wisdom from his birth; God's noblest work—His image upon earth! The day arrives, the moment wished and feared; The child is born, by many a pang endeared. And now the mother's ear has caught his cry; Oh grant the cherub to her asking eye! He comes ... she clasps him. To her bosom pressed, He drinks the balm of life and drops to rest. Her by her smile how soon the Stranger knews; How soon by his the glad discovery shows! As to her lips she lifts the lovely boy, What answering looks of sympathy and joy! He walks, he speaks. In many a broken word His wants, his wishes, and his griefs are heard. And ever, ever to her lap he flies, When rosy Sleep comes on with sweet surprise. Lock'd in her arms, his arms across her flung, (That name most dear for ever on his tongue) As with soft accents round her neck he clings, And, cheek to cheek, her lulling song she sings, How blest to feel the beatings of his heart, Breathe his sweet breath, and kiss for kiss impart; Watch o'er his slumbers like the brooding dove, And, if she can, exhaust a mother's love! But soon a nobler task demands her care. Apart she joins his little hands in prayer, Telling of Him who sees in secret there!— And now the volume on her knee has caught His wandering eye—now many a written thought Never to die, with many a lisping sweet His moving, murmuring lips endeavour to repeat. Released, he chases the bright butterfly; Oh he would follow—follow through the sky! Climbs the gaunt mastiff slumbering in his chain, And chides and buffets, clinging by the mane; Then runs, and, kneeling by the fountain-side, Sends his brave ship in triumph down the tide, A dangerous voyage; or, if now he can, If now he wears the habit of a man, Flings off the coat so much his pride and pleasure, And, like a miser digging for his treasure, His tiny spade in his own garden plies, And in green letters sees his name arise! Where'er he goes, for ever in her sight, She looks, and looks, and still with new delight! Ah who, when fading of itself away, Would cloud the sunshine of his little day! Now is the May of Life. Exulting round, Joy wings his feet, Joy lifts him from the ground! Pointing to such, well might Cornelia say, When the rich casket shone in bright array, “These are my Jewels!” Well of such as he, When Jesus spake, well might the language be, “Suffer these little ones to come to me!” Thoughtful by fits, he scans and he reveres The brow engraven with the Thoughts of Years; Close by her side his silent homage given As to some pure Intelligence from Heaven; His eyes cast downward with ingenuous shame, His conscious cheeks, conscious of praise or blame, At once lit up as with a holy flame! He thirsts for knowledge, speaks but to inquire; And soon with tears relinquish'd to the Sire, Soon in his hand to Wisdom's temple led, Holds secret converse with the Mighty Dead; Trembles and thrills and weeps as they inspire, Burns as they burn, and with congenial fire! Like Her most gentle, most unfortunate, Crown'd but to die—who in her chamber sate Musing with Plato, though the horn was blown, And every ear and every heart was won, And all in green array were chasing down the sun! Then is the Age of Admiration—Then Gods walk the earth, or beings more than men; Who breathe the soul of Inspiration round, Whose very shadows consecrate the ground! Ah, then comes thronging many a wild desire, And high imagining and thought of fire! Then from within a voice exclaims “Aspire!” Phantoms, that upward point, before him pass, As in the Cave athwart the Wizard's glass; They, that on Youth a grace, a lustre shed, Of every Age—the living and the dead! Thou, all-accomplish'd Surrey, thou art known; The flower of Knighthood, nipt as soon as blown! Melting all hearts but Geraldine's alone! And, with his beaver up, discovering there One who loved less to conquer than to spare, Lo, the Black Warrior, he, who, battle-spent, Bare-headed served the Captive in his tent! Young B—in the groves of Academe, Or where Ilissus winds his whispering stream; Or where the wild bees swarm with ceaseless hum, Dreaming old dreams—a joy for years to come; Or on the Rock within the sacred Fane;— Scenes such as Milton sought, but sought in vain: And Milton's self (at that thrice-honour'd name Well may we glow—as men, we share his fame) And Milton's self, apart with beaming eye, Planning he knows not what—that shall not die! Oh, in thy truth secure, thy virtue bold, Beware the poison in the cup of gold, The asp among the flowers. Thy heart beats high, As bright and brighter breaks the distant sky! But every step is on enchanted ground. Danger thou lov'st, and Danger haunts thee round. Who spurs his horse against the mountain-side; Then, plunging, slakes his fury in the tide? Draws, and cries ho! and, where the sun-beams fall, At his own shadow thrusts along the wall? Who dances without music; and anon Sings like the lark—then sighs as woe-begone, And folds his arms, and, where the willows wave, Glides in the moonshine by a maiden's grave? Come hither, boy, and clear thy open brow. Yon summer-clouds, now like the Alps, and now A ship, a whale, change not so fast as thou. He hears me not—Those sighs were from the heart. Too, too well taught, he plays the lover's part. He who at masques, nor feigning nor sincere, With sweet discourse would win a lady's ear, Lie at her feet and on her slipper swear That none were half so faultless, half so fair, Now through the forest hies, a stricken deer, A banish'd man, flying when none are near; And writes on every tree, and lingers long Where most the nightingale repeats her song; Where most the nymph, that haunts the silent grove, Delights to syllable the names we love. Two on his steps attend, in motley clad; One woeful-wan, one merry but as mad; Call'd Hope and Fear. Hope shakes his cap and bells, And flowers spring up among the woodland dells. To Hope he listens, wandering without measure Thro' sun and shade, lost in a trance of pleasure; And, if to Fear but for a weary mile, Hope follows fast and wins him with a smile. At length he goes—a Pilgrim to the Shrine, And for a relic would a world resign! A glove, a shoe-tie, or a flower let fall— What though the least, Love consecrates them all! And now he breathes in many a plaintive verse; Now wins the dull ear of the wily nurse At early matins ('twas at matin-time That first he saw and sicken'd in his prime) And soon the Sibyl, in her thirst for gold, Plays with young hearts that will not be controll'd. “Absence from Thee—as self from self it seems!” Scaled is the garden-wall; and lo, her beams Silvering the east, the moon comes up, revealing His well-known form along the terrace stealing. —Oh, ere in sight he came, 'twas his to thrill A heart that loved him though in secret still. “Am I awake? or is it. .. can it be An idle dream? Nightly it visits me! —That strain,” she cries, “as from the water rose, Now near and nearer through the shade it flows!— Now sinks departing—sweetest in its close!” No casement gleams; no Juliet, like the day, Comes forth and speaks and bids her lover stay. Still, like aërial music heard from far, As through the doors of Paradise ajar, Nightly it rises with the evening-star. —“She loves another! Love was in that sigh!” On the cold ground he throws himself to die. Fond Youth, beware. Thy heart is most deceiving. Who wish are fearful; who suspect, believing. —And soon her looks the rapturous truth avow. Lovely before, oh, say how lovely now! She flies not, frowns not, though he pleads his cause; Nor yet—nor yet her hand from his withdraws; But by some secret Power surprised, subdued, (Ah, how resist? And would she if she could?) Falls on his neck as half unconscious where, Glad to conceal her tears, her blushes there. Then come those full confidings of the past; All sunshine now, where all was overcast. Then do they wander till the day is gone, Lost in each other; and when Night steals on, Covering them round, how sweet her accents are! Oh when she turns and speaks, her voice is far, Far above singing!—But soon nothing stirs To break the silence—Joy like his, like hers, Deals not in words; and now the shadows close, Now in the glimmering, dying light she grows Less and less earthly! As departs the day, All that was mortal seems to melt away, Till, like a gift resumed as soon as given, She fades at last into a Spirit from Heaven! Then are they blest indeed; and swift the hours Till her young Sisters wreathe her hair in flowers, Kindling her beauty—while, unseen, the least Twitches her robe, then runs behind the rest, Known by her laugh that will not be suppress'd. Then before All they stand—the holy vow And ring of gold, no fond illusions now, Bind her as his. Across the threshold led, And every tear kiss'd off as soon as shed, His house she enters—there to be a light Shining within, when all without is night; A guardian-angel o'er his life presiding, Doubling his pleasures, and his cares dividing; Winning him back, when mingling in the throng, From a vain world we love, alas, too long, To fire-side happiness, and hours of ease Blest with that charm, the certainty to please. How oft her eyes read his; her gentle mind To all his wishes, all his thoughts inclined; Still subject—ever on the watch to borrow Mirth of his mirth, and sorrow of his sorrow. The soul of music slumbers in the shell, Till waked and kindled by the master's spell; And feeling hearts—touch them but rightly—pour A thousand melodies unheard before! Nor many moons o'er hill and valley rise Ere to the gate with nymph-like step she flies, And their first-born holds forth, their darling boy, With smiles how sweet, how full of love and joy, To meet him coming; theirs through every year Pure transports, such as each to each endear! And laughing eyes and laughing voices fill Their home with gladness. She, when all are still, Comes and undraws the curtain as they lie, In sleep how beautiful! He, when the sky Gleams, and the wood sends up its harmony, When, gathering round his bed, they climb to share His kisses, and with gentle violence there Break in upon a dream not half so fair, Up to the hill-top leads their little feet; Or by the forest-lodge, perchance to meet The stag-herd on its march, perchance to hear The otter rustling in the sedgy mere; Or to the echo near the Abbot's tree, That gave him back his words of pleasantry— When the House stood, no merrier man than he! And, as they wander with a keen delight, If but a leveret catch their quicker sight Down a green alley, or a squirrel then Climb the gnarled oak, and look and climb again, If but a moth flit by, an acorn fall, He turns their thoughts to Him who made them all; These with unequal footsteps following fast, These clinging by his cloak, unwilling to be last. The shepherd on Tornaro's misty brow, And the swart seaman, sailing far below, Not undelighted watch the morning ray Purpling the orient—till it breaks away, And burns and blazes into glorious day! But happier still is he who bends to trace That sun, the soul, just dawning in the face; The burst, the glow, the animating strife, The thoughts and passions stirring into life; The forming utterance, the inquiring glance, The giant waking from his ten-fold trance, Till up he starts as conscious whence he came, Aud all is light within the trembling frame! What then a Father's feelings? Joy and Fear In turn prevail, Joy most; and through the year Tempering the ardent, urging night and day Him who shrinks back or wanders from the way, Praising each highly—from a wish to raise Their merits to the level of his Praise, Onward in their observing sight he moves, Fearful of wrong, in awe of whom he loves! Their sacred presence who shall dare profane? Who, when He slumbers, hope to fix a stain? He lives a model in his life to show, That, when he dies and through the world they go, Some men may pause and say, when some admire, “They are his sons, and worthy of their sire!” But Man is born to suffer. On the door Sickness has set her mark; and now no more Laughter within we hear, or wood-notes wild As of a mother singing to her child. All now in anguish from that room retire, Where a young cheek glows with consuming fire, And Innocence breathes contagion—all but one, But she who gave it birth—from her alone The medicine-cup is taken. Through the night, And through the day, that with its dreary light Comes unregarded, she sits silent by, Watching the changes with her anxious eye: While they without, listening below, above, (Who but in sorrow know how much they love?) From every little noise catch hope and fear, Exchanging still, still as they turn to hear, Whispers and sighs, and smiles all tenderness That would in vain the starting tear repress. Such grief was ours—it seems but yesterday— When in thy prime, wishing so much to stay, 'Twas thine, Maria, thine without a sigh At midnight in a Sister's arms to die! Oh thou wert lovely—lovely was thy frame, And pure thy spirit as from Heaven it came! And, when recall'd to join the blest above, Thou diedst a victim to exceeding love, Nursing the young to health. In happier hours, When idle Fancy wove luxuriant flowers, Once in thy mirth thou bad'st me write on thee; And now I write—what thou shalt never see! At length the Father, vain his power to save, Follows his child in silence to the grave, (That child how cherish'd, whom he would not give, Sleeping the sleep of death, for All that live;) Takes a last look, when, not unheard, the spade Scatters the earth as “dust to dust” is said, Takes a last look and goes; his best relief Consoling others in that hour of grief, And with sweet tears and gentle words infusing The holy calm that leads to heavenly musing. But hark, the din of arms! no time for sorrow. To horse, to horse! A day of blood to-morrow! One parting pang, and then—and then I fly, Fly to the field, to triumph—or to die!— He goes, and Night comes as it never came! With shrieks of horror!—and a vault of flame! And lo! when morning mocks the desolate, Red runs the river by; and at the gate Breathless a horse without his rider stands! But hush!..a shout from the victorious bands! And oh the smiles and tears, a sire restored! One wears his helm, one buckles on his sword; One hangs the wall with laurel-leaves, and all Spring to prepare the soldier's festival; While She best-loved, till then forsaken never, Clings round his neck as she would cling for ever! Such golden deeds lead on to golden days, Days of domestic peace—by him who plays On the great stage how uneventful thought; Yet with a thousand busy projects fraught, A thousand incidents that stir the mind To pleasure, such as leaves no sting behind! Such as the heart delights in—and records Within how silently—in more than words! A Holiday—the frugal banquet spread On the fresh herbage near the fountain-head With quips and cranks—what time the wood-lark there Scatters his loose notes on the sultry air, What time the king-fisher sits perch'd below, Where, silver-bright, the water-lilies blow:— A Wake—the booths whitening the village green, Where Punch and Scaramouch aloft are seen; Sign beyond sign in close array unfurl'd, Picturing at large the wonders of the world; And far and wide, over the vicar's pale, Black hoods and scarlet crossing hill and dale, All, all abroad, and music in the gale:— A Wedding-dance—a dance into the night On the barn-floor, when maiden-feet are light; When the young bride receives the promised dower, And flowers are flung, herself a fairer flower:— A morning-visit to the poor man's shed, (Who would be rich while One was wanting bread?) When all are emulous to bring relief, And tears are falling fast—but not for grief:— A Walk in Spring—Grattan, like those with thee By the heath-side (who had not envied me?) When the sweet limes, so full of bees in June, Led us to meet beneath their boughs at noon; And thou didst say which of the Great and Wise, Could they but hear and at thy bidding rise, Thou wouldst call up and question. Graver things Come in due order. Every Morning brings Its holy office; and the sabbath-bell, That over wood and wild and mountain-dell Wanders so far, chasing all thoughts unholy With sounds most musical, most melancholy, Not on his ear is lost. Then he pursues The pathway leading through the aged yews, Nor unattended; and, when all are there, Pours out his spirit in the House of Prayer, That House with many a funeral-garland hung Of virgin-white—memorials of the young, The last yet fresh when marriage-chimes were ringing, And hope and joy in other hearts were springing— That House, where Age led in by Filial Love, Their looks composed, their thoughts on things above, The world forgot, or all its wrongs forgiven— Who would not say they trod the path to Heaven? Nor at the fragrant hour—at early dawn— Under the elm-tree on his level lawn, Or in his porch is he less duly found, When they that cry for Justice gather round, And in that cry her sacred voice is drown'd; His then to hear and weigh and arbitrate, Like Alfred judging at his palace-gate. Heal'd at his touch, the wounds of discord close; And they return as friends, that came as foes. Thus, while the world but claims its proper part, Oft in the head but never in the heart, His life steals on; within his quiet dwelling That home-felt joy all other joys excelling. Sick of the crowd, when enters he—nor then Forgets the cold indifference of men? Soon through the gadding vine the sun looks in, And gentle hands the breakfast-rite begin. Then the bright kettle sings its matin-song, Then fragrant clouds of Mocha and Souchong Blend as they rise; and (while without are seen, Sure of their meal, the small birds on the green; And in from far a school-boy's letter flies, Flushing the sister's cheek with glad surprise) That sheet unfolds (who reads, and reads it not?) Born with the day and with the day forgot; Its ample page various as human life, The pomp, the woe, the bustle, and the strife! But nothing lasts. In Autumn at his plough Met and solicited, behold him now Leaving that humbler sphere his fathers knew, The sphere that Wisdom loves, and Virtue too; They who subsist not on the vain applause Misjudging man now gives and now withdraws. 'Twas morn—the sky-lark o'er the furrow sung As from his lips the slow consent was wrung; As from the glebe his fathers till'd of old, The plough they guided in an age of gold, Down by the beech-wood side he turn'd away:— And now behold him in an evil day Serving the State again—not as before, Not foot to foot, the war-whoop at his door,— But in the Senate; and (though round him fly The jest, the sneer, the subtle sophistry,) With honest dignity, with manly sense, And every charm of natural eloquence, Like Hampden struggling in his Country's cause, The first, the foremost to obey the laws, The last to brook oppression. On he moves, Careless of blame while his own heart approves, Careless of ruin—(“For the general good 'Tis not the first time I shall shed my blood.”) On thro' that gate misnamed, thro' which before Went Sidney, Russell, Raleigh, Cranmer, More, On into twilight within walls of stone, Then to the place of trial; and alone, Alone before his judges in array Stands for his life: there, on that awful day, Counsel of friends—all human help denied— All but from her who sits the pen to guide, Like that sweet Saint who sate by Russell's side Under the Judgment-seat. But guilty men Triumph not always. To his hearth again, Again with honour to his hearth restored, Lo, in the accustom'd chair and at the board, Thrice greeting those who most withdraw their claim, (The lowliest servant calling by his name) He reads thanksgiving in the eyes of all, All met as at a holy festival! —On the day destined for his funeral! Lo, there the Friend, who, entering where he lay, Breathed in his drowsy ear “Away, away! Take thou my cloak—Nay, start not, but obey— Take it and leave me.” And the blushing Maid, Who thro' the streets as thro' a desert stray'd; And, when her dear, dear Father pass'd along, Would not be held—but, bursting through the throng, Halberd and battle-axe—kiss'd him o'er and o'er; Then turn'd and went—then sought him as before, Believing she should see his face no more! And oh, how changed at once—no heroine here, But a weak woman worn with grief and fear, Her darling Mother! 'Twas but now she smiled And now she weeps upon her weeping child! —But who sits by, her only wish below At length fulfill'd—and now prepared to go? His hands on hers—as through the mists of night, She gazes on him with imperfect sight; Her glory now, as ever her delight! To her, methinks, a second Youth is given; The light upon her face a light from Heaven! An hour like this is worth a thousand pass'd In pomp or ease—'Tis present to the last! Years glide away untold—'Tis still the same! As fresh, as fair as on the day it came! And now once more where most he loved to be, In his own fields—breathing tranquillity— We hail him—not less happy, Fox, than thee— Thee at St. Anne's so soon of Care beguiled, Playful, sincere, and artless as a child! Thee, who wouldst watch a bird's nest on the spray, Through the green leaves exploring, day by day. How oft from grove to grove, from seat to seat, With thee conversing in thy loved retreat, I saw the sun go down!—Ah, then 'twas thine Ne'er to forget some volume half divine, Shakespeare's or Dryden's—thro' the chequer'd shade Borne in thy hand behind thee as we stray'd; And where we sate (and many a halt we made) To read there with a fervour all thy own, And in thy grand and melancholy tone, Some splendid passage not to thee unknown, Fit theme for long discourse — Thy bell has toll'd! —But in thy place among us we behold One who resembles thee. 'Tis the sixth hour. The village-clock strikes from the distant tower. The ploughman leaves the field; the traveller hears, And to the inn spurs forward. Nature wears Her sweetest smile; the day-star in the west Yet hovering, and the thistle's-down at rest. And such, his labour done, the calm He knows, Whose footsteps we have follow'd. Round him glows An atmosphere that brightens to the last; The light, that shines, reflected from the Past, —And from the Future, too! Active in Thought Among old books, old friends; and not unsought By the wise stranger—in his morning-hours, When gentle airs stir the fresh-blowing flowers, He muses, turning up the idle weed; Or prunes or grafts, or in the yellow mead Watches his bees at hiving-time; and now, The ladder resting on the orchard-bough, Culls the delicious fruit that hangs in air, The purple plum, green fig, or golden pear, Mid sparkling eyes, and hands uplifted there. At night, when all, assembling round the fire, Closer and closer draw till they retire, A tale is told of India or Japan, Of merchants from Golconde or Astracan, What time wild Nature revell'd unrestrain'd, And Sinbad voyaged and the Caliphs reign'd:— Of Knights renown'd from Holy Palestine, And Minstrels, such as swept the lyre divine, When Blondel came, and Richard in his Cell Heard as he lay the song he knew so well:— Of some Norwegian, while the icy gale Rings in her shrouds and beats her iron-sail, Among the shining Alps of Polar seas Immovable—for ever there to freeze! Or some great Caravan, from well to well Winding as darkness on the desert fell, In their long march, such as the Prophet bids, To Mecca from the Land of Pyramids, And in an instant lost—a hollow wave Of burning sand their everlasting grave!— Now the scene shifts to Cashmere—to a glade Where, with her loved gazelle, the dark-eyed Maid (Her fragrant chamber for awhile resign'd, Her lute, by fits discoursing with the wind) Wanders well-pleased, what time the Nightingale Sings to the Rose, rejoicing hill and dale; And now to Venice—to a bridge, a square, Glittering with light, all nations masking there, With light reflected on the tremulous tide, Where gondolas in gay confusion glide, Answering the jest, the song on every side; To Naples next—and at the crowded gate, Where Grief and Fear and wild Amazement wait, Lo, on his back a Son brings in his Sire, Vesuvius blazing like a world on fire!— Then, at a sign that never was forgot, A strain breaks forth (who hears and loves it not?) From harp or organ! 'Tis at parting given, That in their slumbers they may dream of Heaven; Young voices mingling, as it floats along, In Tuscan air or Handel's sacred song! And She inspires, whose beauty shines in all: So soon to weave a daughter's coronal, And at the nuptial rite smile through her tears;— So soon to hover round her full of fears, And with assurance sweet her soul revive In child-birth—when a mother's love is most alive. No, 'tis not here that Solitude is known. Through the wide world he only is alone Who lives not for another. Come what will, The generous man has his companion still; The cricket on his hearth; the buzzing fly, That skims his roof, or, be his roof the sky, Still with its note of gladness passes by: And, in an iron cage condemned to dwell, The cage that stands within the dungeon-cell, He feeds his spider—happier at the worst Than he at large who in himself is curst! O thou all-eloquent, whose mighty mind Streams from the depth of ages on mankind, Streams like the day—who, angel-like, hast shed Thy full effulgence on the hoary head, Speaking in Cato's venerable voice, “Look up, and faint not—faint not, but rejoice!” From thy Elysium guide him. Age has now Stamped with its signet that ingenuous brow; And, 'mid his old hereditary trees, Trees he has climbed so oft, he sits and sees His children's children playing round his knees: Then happiest, youngest, when the quoit is flung, When side by side the archers' bows are strung; His to prescribe the place, adjudge the prize, Envying no more the young their energies Than they an old man when his words are wise; His a delight how pure ... without alloy; Strong in their strength, rejoicing in their joy! Now in their turn assisting, they repay The anxious cares of many and many a day; And now by those he loves relieved, restored, His very wants and weaknesses afford A feeling of enjoyment. In his walks, Leaning on them, how oft he stops and talks, While they look up! Their questions, their replies, Fresh as the welling waters, round him rise, Gladdening his spirit: and, his theme the past, How eloquent he is! His thoughts flow fast; And, while his heart (oh, can the heart grow old? False are the tales that in the World are told!) Swells in his voice, he knows not where to end; Like one discoursing of an absent friend. But there are moments which he calls his own. Then, never less alone than when alone, Those whom he loved so long and sees no more, Loved and still loves—not dead—but gone before, He gathers round him; and revives at will Scenes in his life—that breathe enchantment still— That come not now at dreary intervals— But where a light as from the Blessed falls, A light such guests bring ever—pure and holy— Lapping the soul in sweetest melancholy! —Ah then less willing (nor the choice condemn) To live with others than to think of them! And now behold him up the hill ascending, Memory and Hope like evening-stars attending; Sustained, excited, till his course is run, By deeds of virtue done or to be done. When on his couch he sinks at length to rest, Those by his counsel saved, his power redressed, Those by the World shunned ever as unblest, At whom the rich man's dog growls from the gate, But whom he sought out, sitting desolate, Come and stand round—the widow with her child, As when she first forgot her tears and smiled! They, who watch by him, see not; but he sees, Sees and exults—Were ever dreams like these? They, who watch by him, hear not! but he hears, And Earth recedes, and Heaven itself appears! 'Tis past! That hand we grasped, alas, in vain! Nor shall we look upon his face again! But to his closing eyes, for all were there, Nothing was wanting; and, through many a year We shall remember with a fond delight The words so precious which we heard to-night; His parting, though awhile our sorrow flows, Like setting suns or music at the close! Then was the drama ended. Not till then, So full of chance and change the lives of men, Could we pronounce him happy. Then secure From pain, from grief, and all that we endure, He slept in peace—say rather soared to Heaven, Upborne from Earth by Him to whom 'tis given In his right hand to hold the golden key That opes the portals of Eternity. —When by a good man's grave I muse alone, Methinks an Angel sits upon the stone And, with a voice inspiring joy not fear, Says, pointing upward, “Know, He is not here!” But let us hence; for now the day is spent, And stars are kindling in the firmament, To us how silent—though like ours perchance Busy and full of life and circumstance; Where some the paths of Wealth and Power pursue, Of Pleasure some, of Happiness a few; And, as the sun goes round—a sun not ours— While from her lap another Nature showers Gifts of her own, some from the crowd retire, Think on themselves, within, without inquire; At distance dwell on all that passes there, All that their world reveals of good and fair; Trace out the Journey through their little Day, And dream, like me, an idle hour away. ODE TO SUPERSTITION. 1786. I. 1. Hence, to the realms of Night, dire Demon, hence! Thy chain of adamant can bind That little world, the human mind, And sink its noblest powers to impotence. Wake the lion's loudest roar, Clot his shaggy mane with gore, With flashing fury bid his eye-balls shine; Meek is his savage, sullen soul, to thine! Thy touch, thy deadening touch has steeled the breast, Whence, thro' her April-shower, soft Pity smiled; Has closed the heart each godlike virtue blessed, To all the silent pleadings of his child, At thy command he plants the dagger deep, At thy command exults, tho' Nature bids him weep! I. 2. When, with a frown that froze the peopled earth, Thou dartedst thy huge head from high, Night waved her banners o'er the sky, And, brooding, gave her shapeless shadows birth. Rocking on the billowy air, Ha! what withering phantoms glare! As blows the blast with many a sudden swell, At each dead pause, what shrill-toned voices yell! The sheeted spectre, rising from the tomb, Points to the murderer's stab, and shudders by In every grove is felt a heavier gloom, That veils its genius from the vulgar eye: The spirit of the water rides the storm, And, thro' the mist, reveals the terrors of his form. I. 3. O'er solid seas, where Winter reigns, And holds each mountain-wave in chains, The fur-clad savage, ere he guides his deer By glistering star-light thro' the snow, Breathes softly in her wondering ear Each potent spell thou bad'st him know. By thee inspired, on India's sands, Full in the sun the Brahmin stands; And, while the panting tigress hies To quench her fever in the stream, His spirit laughs in agonies, Smit by the scorchings of the noontide beam Mark who mounts the sacred pyre, Blooming in her bridal vest: She hurls the torch! she fans the fire! To die is to be blest: She clasps her lord to part no more, And, sighing, sinks! but sinks to soar. O'ershadowing Scotia's desert coast, The Sisters sail in dusky state, And, wrapt in clouds, in tempests tost, Weave the airy web of Fate; While the lone shepherd, near the shipless main, Sees o'er her hills advance the long-drawn funeral train. II. 1. Thou spak'st, and lo! a new creation glowed. Each unhewn mass of living stone Was clad in horrors not its own, And at its base the trembling nations bowed. Giant Error, darkly grand, Grasped the globe with iron hand. Circled with seats of bliss, the Lord of Light Saw prostrate worlds adore his golden height. The statue, waking with immortal powers Springs from its parent earth, and shakes the spheres; The indignant pyramid sublimely towers, And braves the efforts of a host of years. Sweet Music breathes her soul into the wind; And bright-eyed Painting stamps the image of the mind. II. 2. Round the rude ark old Egypt's sorcerers rise! A timbrelled anthem swells the gale, And bids the God of Thunders hail; With lowings loud the captive God replies. Clouds of incense woo thy smile, Scaly monarch of the Nile! But ah! what myriads claim the bended knee! Go, count the busy drops that swell the sea. Proud land! what eye can trace thy mystic lore, Locked up in characters as dark as night? What eye those long, long labyrinths dare explore, To which the parted soul oft wings her flight; Again to visit her cold cell of clay, Charmed with perennial sweets, and smiling at decay? II. 3. On yon hoar summit, mildly bright With purple ether's liquid light, High o'er the world, the white-robed Magi gaze On dazzling bursts of heavenly fire; Start at each blue, portentous blaze, Each flame that flits with adverse spire. But say, what sounds my ear invade From Delphi's venerable shade? The temple rocks, the laurel waves! “The God! the God!” the Sibyl cries. Her figure swells! she foams, she raves! Her figure swells to more than mortal size! Streams of rapture roll along, Silver notes ascend the skies: Wake, Echo, wake and catch the song, Oh catch it, ere it dies! The Sibyl speaks, the dream is o'er, The holy harpings charm no more. In vain she checks the God's control; His madding spirit fills her frame, And moulds the features of her soul, Breathing a prophetic flame. The cavern frowns; its hundred mouths un close! And, in the thunder's voice, the fate of empire flows! III. 1. Mona, thy Druid-rites awake the dead! Rites thy brown oaks would never dare Even whisper to the idle air; Rites that have chained old Ocean on his bed. Shivered by thy piercing glance, Pointless falls the hero's lance. Thy magic bids the imperial eagle fly, And blasts the laureate wreath of victory. Hark, the bard's soul inspires the vocal string! At every pause dread Silence hovers o'er: While murky Night sails round on raven-wing, Deepening the tempest's howl, the torrent's roar; Chased by the Morn from Snowdon's awful brow Where late she sate and scowled on the black wave below. III. 2. Lo, steel-clad War his gorgeous standard rears! The red-cross squadrons madly rage, And mow thro' infancy and age; Then kiss the sacred dust and melt in tears. Veiling from the eye of day, Penance dreams her life away; In cloistered solitude she sits and sighs, While from each shrine still, small responses rise. Hear, with what heart-felt beat, the midnight bell Swings its slow summons thro' the hollow pile! The weak, wan votarist leaves her twilight cell, To walk, with taper dim, the winding aisle; With choral chantings vainly to aspire Beyond this nether sphere, on Rapture's wing of fire. III. 3. Lord of each pang the nerves can feel, Hence with the rack and reeking wheel. Faith lifts the soul above this little ball! While gleams of glory open round, And circling choirs of angels call, Canst thou, with all thy terrors crowned, Hope to obscure that latent spark, Destined to shine when suns are dark? Thy triumphs cease! thro' every land, Hark! Truth proclaims, thy triumphs cease! Her heavenly form, with glowing hand, Benignly points to piety and peace. Flushed with youth, her looks impart Each fine feeling as it flows; Her voice the echo of a heart Pure as the mountain-snows: Celestial transports round her play, And softly, sweetly die away. She smiles! and where is now the cloud That blackened o'er thy baleful reign? Grim darkness furls his leaden shroud, Shrinking from her glance in vain. Her touch unlocks the day-spring from above, And lo! it visits man with beams of light and love. THE SAILOR. 1786. The Sailor sighs as sinks his native shore, As all its lessening turrets bluely fade; He climbs the mast to feast his eye once more, And busy fancy fondly lends her aid. Ah! now, each dear, domestic scene he knew, Recalled and cherished in a foreign clime, Charms with the magic of a moonlight view; Its colours mellowed, not impaired, by time. True as the needle, homeward points his heart, Thro' all the horrors of the stormy main; This, the last wish that would with life depart, To meet the smile of her he loves again. When Morn first faintly draws her silver line, Or Eve's grey cloud descends to drink the wave; When sea and sky in midnight-darkness join, Still, still he sees the parting look she gave. Her gentle spirit, lightly hovering o'er, Attends his little bark from pole to pole; And, when the beating billows round him roar, Whispers sweet hope to soothe his troubled soul. Carved is her name in many a spicy grove, In many a plantain-forest, waving wide; Where dusky youths in painted plumage rove, And giant palms o'er-arch the golden tide. But lo, at last he comes with crowded sail! Lo, o'er the cliff what eager figures bend! And hark, what mingled murmurs swell the gale! In each he hears the welcome of a friend. —'T is she, 't is she herself! she waves her hand! Soon is the anchor cast, the canvas furled; Soon thro' the whitening surge he springs to land, And clasps the maid he singled from the world. A WISH. 1786. Mine be a cot beside the hill; A bee-hive's hum shall soothe my ear; A willowy brook, that turns a mill, With many a fall shall linger near. The swallow, oft, beneath my thatch, Shall twitter from her clay-built nest; Oft shall the pilgrim lift the latch, And share my meal, a welcome guest. Around my ivy'd porch shall spring Each fragrant flower that drinks the dew; And Lucy, at her wheel, shall sing In russet gown and apron blue. The village-church, among the trees, Where first our marriage-vows were given, With merry peals shall swell the breeze, And point with taper spire to heaven. AN ITALIAN SONG. 1793. Dear is my little native vale, The ring-dove builds and murmurs there; Close by my cot she tells her tale To every passing villager. The squirrel leaps from tree to tree, And shells his nuts at liberty. In orange-groves and myrtle-bowers, That breathe a gale of fragrance round, I charm the fairy-footed hours With my loved lute's romantic sound; Or crowns of living laurel weave, For those that win the race at eve. The shepherd's horn at break of day, The ballet danced in twilight glade, The canzonet and roundelay Sung in the silent green-wood shade: These simple joys, that never fail, Shall bind me to my native vale. THE ALPS AT DAY-BREAK. 1786. The sun-beams streak the azure skies, And line with light the mountain's brow: With hounds and horns the hunters rise, And chase the roebuck thro' the snow. From rock to rock, with giant-bound, High on their iron poles they pass; Mute, lest the air, convulsed by sound, Rend from above a frozen mass. The goats wind slow their wonted way, Up craggy steeps and ridges rude; Marked by the wild wolf for his prey, From desert cave or hanging wood. And while the torrent thunders loud, And as the echoing cliffs reply, The huts peep o'er the morning-cloud, Perched, like an eagle's nest, on high. ON A TEAR. 1793. Oh! that the Chemist's magic art Could crystallize this sacred treasure! Long should it glitter near my heart, A secret source of pensive pleasure. The little brilliant, ere it fell, Its lustre caught from Chloe's eye; Then, trembling, left its coral cell— The spring of Sensibility! Sweet drop of pure and pearly light! In thee the rays of Virtue shine; More calmly clear, more mildly bright, Than any gem that gilds the mine. Benign restorer of the soul! Who ever fly'st to bring relief, When first we feel the rude control Of Love or Pity, Joy or Grief. The sage's and the poet's theme, In every clime, in every age; Thou charm'st in Fancy's idle dream, In Reason's philosophic page. That very law which moulds a tear, And bids it trickle from its source, That law preserves the earth a sphere, And guides the planets in their course. WRITTEN IN A SICK CHAMBER. 1793. There, in that bed so closely curtained round, Worn to a shade and wan with slow decay, A father sleeps! Oh hushed be every sound! Soft may we breathe the midnight hours away! He stirs—yet still he sleeps. May heavenly dreams Long o'er his smooth and settled pillow rise; Nor fly, till morning through the shutter streams, And on the hearth the glimmering rush-light dies. TO TWO SISTERS. 1795. Well may you sit within, and, fond of grief, Look in each other's face, and melt in tears. Well may you shun all counsel, all relief. Oh she was great in mind, tho' young in years! Changed is that lovely countenance, which shed Light when she spoke; and kindled sweet surprise, As o'er her frame each warm emotion spread, Played round her lips, and sparkled in her eyes. Those lips so pure, that moved but to persuade, Still to the last enlivened and endeared. Those eyes at once her secret soul conveyed, And ever beamed delight when you appeared. Yet has she fled the life of bliss below, That youthful Hope in bright perspective drew? False were the tints! false as the feverish glow That o'er her burning cheek Distemper threw! And now in joy she dwells, in glory moves! (Glory and joy reserved for you to share.) Far, far more blest in blessing those she loves, Than they, alas! unconscious of her care. TO A FRIEND ON HIS MARRIAGE. 1798. On thee, blest youth, a father's hand confers The maid thy earliest, fondest wishes knew. Each soft enchantment of the soul is hers; Thine be the joys to firm attachment due. As on she moves with hesitating grace, She wins assurance from his soothing voice; And, with a look the pencil could not trace, Smiles thro' her blushes and confirms the choice. Spare the fine tremors of her feeling frame! To thee she turns—forgive a virgin's fears! To thee she turns with surest, tenderest claim; Weakness that charms, reluctance that endears! At each response the sacred rite requires, From her full bosom bursts the unbidden sigh. A strange mysterious awe the scene inspires; And on her lips the trembling accents die. O'er her fair face what wild emotions play! What lights and shades in sweet confusion blend! Soon shall they fly, glad harbingers of day, And settled sunshine on her soul descend! Ah soon, thine own confess'd, ecstatic thought! That hand shall strew thy summer-path with flowers; And those blue eyes, with mildest lustre fraught, Gild the calm current of domestic hours! WRITTEN TO BE SPOKEN BY MRS. SIDDONS. Yes, 't is the pulse of life; my fears were vain; I wake, I breathe, and am myself again. Still in this nether world; no seraph yet! Nor walks my spirit, when the sun is set, With troubled step to haunt the fatal board, Where I died last—by poison or the sword; Blanching each honest cheek with deeds of night, Done here so oft by dim and doubtful light. —To drop all metaphor, that little bell Called back reality, and broke the spell. No heroine claims your tears with tragic tone; A very woman—scarce restrains her own! Can she, with fiction, charm the cheated mind, When to be grateful is the part assigned? Ah, no! she scorns the trappings of her Art; No theme but truth, no prompter but the heart! But, Ladies, say, must I alone unmask? Is here no other actress, let me ask. Believe me, those, who best the heart dissect, Know every Woman studies stage-effect. She moulds her manners to the part she fills, As Instinct teaches, or as Humour wills; And, as the grave or gay her talent calls, Acts in the drama, till the curtain falls. First, how her little breast with triumph swells When the red coral rings its golden bells! To play in pantomime is then the rage, Along the carpet's many-coloured stage; Or lisp her merry thoughts with loud endeavour, Now here, now there,—in noise and mischief ever! A school-girl next, she curls her hair in papers, And mimics father's gout, and mother's vapours; Discards her doll, bribes Betty for romances; Playful at church, and serious when she dances; Tramples alike on customs and on toes, And whispers all she hears to all she knows; Terror of caps, and wigs, and sober notions! A romp! that longest of perpetual motions! —Till tamed and tortured into foreign graces, She sports her lovely face at public places; And with blue, laughing eyes, behind her fan, First acts her part with that great actor, man. Too soon a flirt, approach her and she flies! Frowns when pursued, and, when entreated, sighs! Plays with unhappy men as cats with mice; Till fading beauty hints the late advice. Her prudence dictates what her pride disdained, And now she sues to slaves herself had chained! Then comes that good old character, a Wife, With all the dear, distracting cares of life; A thousand cards a day at doors to leave, And, in return, a thousand cards receive; Rouge high, play deep, to lead the ton aspire, With nightly blaze set Portland-place on fire; Snatch half a glimpse at Concert, Opera, Ball, A meteor, traced by none, tho' seen by all; And, when her shattered nerves forbid to roam, In very spleen—rehearse the girls at home. Last the grey Dowager, in ancient flounces, With snuff and spectacles the age denounces; Boasts how the Sires of this degenerate Isle Knelt for a look, and duelled for a smile. The scourge and ridicule of Goth and Vandal, Her tea she sweetens, as she sips, with scandal; With modern Belles eternal warfare wages, Like her own birds that clamour from their cages; And shuffles round to bear her tale to all, Like some old Ruin, “nodding to its fall!” Thus Woman makes her entrance and her exit; Not least an actress when she least suspects it. Yet Nature oft peeps out and mars the plot, Each lesson lost, each poor pretence forgot; Full oft, with energy that scorns control, At once lights up the features of the soul; Unlocks each thought chained down by coward Art, And to full day the latent passions start! —And she, whose first, best wish is your applause, Herself exemplifies the truth she draws. Born on the stage—thro' every shifting scene, Obscure or bright, tempestuous or serene, Still has your smile, her trembling spirit fired! And can she act, with thoughts like these inspired? No! from her mind all artifice she flings, All skill, all practice, now unmeaning things! To you, unchecked, each genuine feeling flows; For all that life endears—to you she owes. A FAREWELL. 1797. Adieu! A long, a long adieu! I must be gone while yet I may. Oft shall I weep to think of you; But here I will not, cannot stay. The sweet expression of that face, For ever changing, yet the same, Ah no, I dare not turn to trace. It melts my soul, it fires my frame! Yet give me, give me, ere I go, One little lock of those so blest, That lend your cheek a warmer glow, And on your white neck love to rest. —Say, when, to kindle soft delight, That hand has chanced with mine to meet, How could its thrilling touch excite, A sigh so short, and yet so sweet? O say—but no, it must not be. Adieu! A long, a long adieu! —Yet still, methinks, you frown on me; Or never could I fly from you. TO ? 1814. Go—you may call it madness, folly; You shall not chase my gloom away. There's such a charm in melancholy, I would not, if I could, be gay. Oh, if you knew the pensive pleasure That fills my bosom when I sigh, You would not rob me of a treasure Monarchs are too poor to buy. FROM EURIPIDES. There is a streamlet issuing from a rock. The village-girls, singing wild madrigals, Dip their white vestments in its waters clear, And hang them to the sun. There first we met, There on that day. Her dark and eloquent eyes 'Twas heaven to look upon; and her sweet voice, As tuneable as harp of many strings, At once spoke joy and sadness to my soul! Dear is that valley to the murmuring bees; And all, who know it, come and come again. The small birds build there; and at summer-noon Oft have I heard a child, gay among flowers, As in the shining grass she sate concealed, Sing to herself. . . . . . . . . . FROM AN ITALIAN SONNET. 1810. Love, under Friendship's vesture white, Laughs, his little limbs concealing; And oft in sport, and oft in spite, Like Pity meets the dazzled sight, Smiles thro' his tears revealing. But now as Rage the God appears! He frowns, and tempests shake his frame!— Frowning, or smiling, or in tears, 'Tis Love; and Love is still the same. FROM A GREEK EPIGRAM. 1801. While on the cliff with calm delight she kneels And the blue vales a thousand joys recall, See, to the last, last verge her infant steals! O fly—yet stir not, speak not, lest it fall. Far better taught, she lays her bosom bare, And the fond boy springs back to nestle there. A CHARACTER. 1801. As thro' the hedge-row shade the violet steals, And the sweet air its modest leaf reveals; Her softer charms, but by their influence known, Surprise all hearts, and mould them to her own. CAPTIVITY. 1801. Caged in old woods, whose reverend echoes wake When the hern screams along the distant lake, Her little heart oft flutters to be free, Oft sighs to turn the unrelenting key. In vain! the nurse that rusted relic wears, Nor moved by gold—nor to be moved by tears; And terraced walls their black reflection throw On the green-mantled moat that sleeps below. WRITTEN AT MIDNIGHT. 1806. While thro' the broken pane the tempest sighs, And my step falters on the faithless floor, Shades of departed joys around me rise, With many a face that smiles on me no more; With many a voice that thrills of transport gave, Now silent as the grass that tufts their grave! TO AN OLD OAK. 1806. Trunk of a Giant now no more! Once did thy limbs to heaven aspire; Once, by a track untried before, Strike as resolving to explore Realms of infernal fire. Round thee, alas, no shadows move! From thee no sacred murmurs breathe! Yet within thee, thyself a grove, Once did the eagle scream above, And the wolf howl beneath. There once the red-cross knight reclined, His resting place, a house of prayer; And, when the death-bell smote the wind From towers long fled by human kind, He knelt and worshipped there! Then Culture came, and days serene; And village-sports, and garlands gay. Full many a pathway crossed the green; And maids and shepherd-youths were seen To celebrate the May. Father of many a forest deep, Whence many a navy thunder-fraught! Erst in thy acorn-cells asleep, Soon destined o'er the world to sweep Opening new spheres of thought! Wont in the night of woods to dwell, The holy Druid saw thee rise; And, planting there the guardian-spell, Sung forth, the dreadful pomp to swell Of human sacrifice! Thy singed top and branches bare Now straggle in the evening-sky; And the wan moon wheels round to glare On the long corse that shivers there Of him who came to die! TO THE GNAT. 1798. When by the green-wood side, at summer eve, Poetic visions charm my closing eye; And fairy-scenes, that Fancy loves to weave, Shift to wild notes of sweetest minstrelsy; 'Tis thine to range in busy quest of prey, Thy feathery antlers quivering with delight, Brush from my lids the hues of heaven away, And all is Solitude, and all is Night! —Ah now thy barbed shaft, relentless fly, Unsheaths its terrors in the sultry air! No guardian sylph, in golden panoply, Lifts the broad shield, and points the glittering spear. Now near and nearer rush thy whirring wings, Thy dragon-scales still wet with human gore. Hark, thy shrill horn its fearful larum flings! —I wake in horror, and dare sleep no more! TO THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF LADY ? 1798. Ah! why with tell-tale tongue reveal What most her blushes would conceal? Why lift that modest veil to trace The seraph-sweetness of her face? Some fairer, better sport prefer; And feel for us, if not for her. For this presumption, soon or late, Know thine shall be a kindred fate. Another shall in vengeance rise— Sing Harriet's cheeks, and Harriet's eyes; And, echoing back her wood-notes wild, —Trace all the mother in the child! TO A VOICE THAT HAD BEEN LOST. Vane, quid affectas faciem mihi ponere, pictor? Aeris et linguæ sum filia; Et, si vis similem pingere, pinge sonum. —Ausonius. Once more, Enchantress of the soul, Once more we hail thy soft control. —Yet whither, whither didst thou fly? To what bright region of the sky? Say, in what distant star to dwell? (Of other worlds thou seem'st to tell) Or, trembling, fluttering here below, Resolved and unresolved to go, In secret didst thou still impart Thy raptures to the pure in heart? Perhaps to many a desert shore, Thee, in his rage, the Tempest bore; Thy broken murmurs swept along, Mid Echoes yet untuned by song; Arrested in the realms of Frost, Or in the wilds of Ether lost. Far happier thou! 'twas thine to soar, Careering on the winged wind. Thy triumphs who shall dare explore? Suns and their systems left behind. No tract of space, no distant star, No shock of elements at war, Did thee detain. Thy wing of fire Bore thee amid the Cherub-choir; And there awhile to thee 'twas given Once more that Voice beloved to join, Which taught thee first a flight divine, And nursed thy infant years with many a strain from Heaven! TO THE BUTTERFLY. 1806. Child of the sun! pursue thy rapturous flight, Mingling with her thou lov'st in fields of light; And, where the flowers of Paradise unfold, Quaff fragrant nectar from their cups of gold. There shall thy wings, rich as an evening-sky, Expand and shut with silent ecstasy! —Yet wert thou once a worm, a thing that crept On the bare earth, then wrought a tomb and slept. And such is man; soon from his cell of clay To burst a seraph in the blaze of day! TO ? 1810. Ah! little thought she, when, with wild delight, By many a torrent's shining track she flew, When mountain-glens and caverns full of night, O'er her young mind divine enchantment threw, That in her veins a secret horror slept, That her light footsteps should be heard no more, That she should die—nor watched, alas, nor wept By thee, unconscious of the pangs she bore. Yet round her couch indulgent Fancy drew The kindred forms her closing eye required. There didst thou stand—there, with the smile she knew; She moved her lips to bless thee, and expired. And now to thee she comes; still, still the same As in the hours gone unregarded by! To thee, how changed, comes as she ever came; Health on her cheek, and pleasure in her eye! Nor less, less oft, as on that day, appears, When lingering, as prophetic of the truth, By the way-side she shed her parting tears— For ever lovely in the light of Youth! TO THE FRAGMENT OF A STATUE OF HERCULES, COMMONLY CALLED THE TORSO. 1806. And dost thou still, thou mass of breathing stone, (Thy giant limbs to night and chaos hurled) Still sit as on the fragment of a world; Surviving all, majestic and alone? What tho' the Spirits of the North, that swept Rome from the earth when in her pomp she slept, Smote thee with fury, and thy headless trunk Deep in the dust mid tower and temple sunk; Soon to subdue mankind 'twas thine to rise, Still, still unquelled thy glorious energies! Aspiring minds, with thee conversing, caught Bright revelations of the Good they sought; By thee that long-lost spell in secret given, To draw down Gods, and lift the soul to Heaven! AN EPITAPH ON A ROBIN-REDBREAST. 1806. Tread lightly here, for here, 'tis said, When piping winds are hushed around, A small note wakes from underground, Where now his tiny bones are laid. No more in lone and leafless groves, With ruffled wing and faded breast, His friendless, homeless spirit roves; —Gone to the world where birds are blest! Where never cat glides o'er the green, Or school-boy's giant form is seen; But Love, and Joy, and smiling Spring Inspire their little souls to sing! THE BOY OF EGREMOND. 1819. Say, what remains when Hope is fled?” She answered, “Endless weeping!” For in the herdsman's eye she read Who in his shroud lay sleeping. At Embsay rung the matin-bell, The stag was roused on Barden-fell; The mingled sounds were swelling, dying, And down the Wharfe a hern was flying; When near the cabin in the wood, In tartan clad and forest-green, With hound in leash and hawk in hood, The Boy of Egremond was seen. Blithe was his song, a song of yore; But where the rock is rent in two, And the river rushes through, His voice was heard no more! 'Twas but a step! the gulf he passed; But that step—it was his last! As through the mist he winged his way, (A cloud that hovers night and day,) The hound hung back, and back he drew The Master and his merlin too. That narrow place of noise and strife Received their little all of Life! There now the matin-bell is rung; The “Miserere!” duly sung; And holy men in cowl and hood Are wandering up and down the wood. But what avail they? Ruthless Lord, Thou didst not shudder when the sword Here on the young its fury spent, The helpless and the innocent. Sit now and answer, groan for groan. The child before thee is thy own. And she who wildly wanders there, The mother in her long despair, Shall oft remind thee, waking, sleeping, Of those who by the Wharfe were weeping; Of those who would not be consoled When red with blood the river rolled. WRITTEN IN THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND September 2, 1812. Blue was the loch, the clouds were gone, Ben-Lomond in his glory shone, When, Luss, I left thee; when the breeze Bore me from thy silver sands, Thy kirk-yard wall among the trees, Where, grey with age, the dial stands; That dial so well-known to me! —Tho' many a shadow it had shed, Beloved Sister, since with thee The legend on the stone was read. The fairy-isles fled far away; That with its woods and uplands green, Where shepherd-huts are dimly seen, And songs are heard at close of day; That too, the deer's wild covert, fled, And that, the asylum of the dead: While, as the boat went merrily, Much of Rob Roy the boat-man told; His arm that fell below his knee, His cattle-ford and mountain-hold. Tarbat, thy shore I climbed at last; And, thy shady region passed, Upon another shore I stood, And looked upon another flood; Great Ocean's self! ('Tis He who fills That vast and awful depth of hills;) Where many an elf was playing round, Who treads unshod his classic ground; And speaks, his native rocks among, As Fingal spoke, and Ossian sung. Night fell; and dark and darker grew That narrow sea, that narrow sky, As o'er the glimmering waves we flew; The sea-bird rustling, wailing by. And now the grampus, half-descried, Black and huge above the tide; The cliffs and promontories there, Front to front, and broad and bare; Each beyond each, with giant-feet Advancing as in haste to meet; The shattered fortress, whence the Dane Blew his shrill blast, nor rushed in vain, Tyrant of the drear domain; All into midnight-shadow sweep— When day springs upward from the deep! Kindling the waters in its flight, The prow wakes splendour; and the oar, That rose and fell unseen before, Flashes in a sea of light! Glad sign, and sure! for now we hail Thy flowers, Glenfinnart, in the gale; And bright indeed the path should be, That leads to Friendship and to Thee! Oh blest retreat, and sacred too! Sacred as when the bell of prayer Tolled duly on the desert air, And crosses decked thy summits blue. Oft, like some loved romantic tale, Oft shall my weary mind recall, Amid the hum and stir of men, Thy beechen grove and waterfall, Thy ferry with its gliding sail, And Her—the Lady of the Glen! ON ? ASLEEP. 1810. Sleep on, and dream of Heaven awhile. Tho' shut so close thy laughing eyes, Thy rosy lips still wear a smile, And move, and breathe delicious sighs!— Ah, now soft blushes tinge her cheeks, And mantle o'er her neck of snow. Ah, now she murmurs, now she speaks What most I wish—and fear to know. She starts, she trembles, and she weeps! Her fair hands folded on her breast. —And now, how like a saint she sleeps! A seraph in the realms of rest! Sleep on secure! Above control, Thy thoughts belong to Heaven and thee! And may the secret of thy soul Remain within its sanctuary! AN INSCRIPTION IN THE CRIMEA. 1812. Shepherd, or Huntsman, or worn Mariner, Whate'er thou art, who wouldst allay thy thirst, Drink and be glad. This cistern of white stone, Arched, and o'erwrought with many a sacred verse, This iron cup chained for the general use, And these rude seats of earth within the grove, Were given by Fatima. Borne hence a bride, 'Twas here she turned from her beloved sire, To see his face no more. Oh, if thou canst, ('Tis not far off) visit his tomb with flowers; And with a drop of this sweet water fill The two small cells scooped in the marble there, That birds may come and drink upon his grave, Making it holy . . . . . . . . . . AN INSCRIPTION FOR A TEMPLE DEDICATED TO THE GRACES. 1822. Approach with reverence. There are those within, Whose dwelling-place is Heaven. Daughters of Jove, From them flow all the decencies of Life; Without them nothing pleases, Virtue's self Admired not loved: and those on whom They smile, Great though they be, and wise, and beautiful, Shine forth with double lustre. WRITTEN AT MIDNIGHT. September 3, 1848. If Day reveals such wonders by her Light, What by her Darkness cannot Night reveal? For at her bidding when She mounts her throne The Heavens unfold, and from the depths of Space Sun beyond Sun, as when called forth they came, Each with the worlds that round him rolled rejoicing, Sun beyond Sun in numbers numberless Shine with a radiance that is all their own! REFLECTIONS. Man to the last is but a froward child; So eager for the future, come what may, And to the present so insensible! Oh, if he could in all things as he would, Years would as days and hours as moments be; He would, so restless is his spirit here, Give wings to Time, and wish his life away! Alas, to our discomfort and his own, Oft are the greatest talents to be found In a fool's keeping. For what else is he, However worldly wise and worldly strong, Who can pervert and to the worst abuse The noblest means to serve the noblest ends Who can employ the gift of eloquence, That sacred gift, to dazzle and delude; Or, if achievement in the field be his, Climb but to gain a loss, suffering how much, And how much more inflicting! Every where, Cost what they will, such cruel freaks are played; And hence the turmoil in this world of ours, The turmoil never ending, still beginning, The wailing and the tears.—When Cæsar came, He who could master all men but himself, Who did so much and could so well record it; Even he, the most applauded in his part, Who, when he spoke, all things summed up in him, Spoke to convince, nor ever, when he fought, Fought but to conquer—what a life was his, Slaying so many, to be slain at last, A life of trouble and incessant toil, And all to gain what is far better missed! The heart, they say, is wiser than the schools: And well they may. All that is great in thought, That strikes at once as with electric fire, And lifts us, as it were, from earth to heaven, Comes from the heart; and who confesses not Its voice as sacred, nay almost divine, When inly it declares on what we do, Blaming, approving? Let an erring world Judge as it will, we care not while we stand Acquitted there; and oft, when clouds on clouds Compass us round and not a track appears, Oft is an upright heart the surest guide, Surer and better than the subtlest head; Still with its silent counsels thro' the dark Onward and onward leading. This Child, so lovely and so cherub-like, (No fairer spirit in the heaven of heavens) Say, must he know remorse? Must Passion come, Passion in all or any of its shapes, To cloud and sully what is now so pure? Yes, come it must. For who, alas! has lived, Nor in the watches of the night recalled Words he has wished unsaid and deeds undone? Yes, come it must. But if, as we may hope, He learns ere long to discipline his mind, And onward goes, humbly and cheerfully, Assisting them that faint, weak though he be, And in his trying hours trusting in God— Fair as he is, he shall be fairer still; For what was Innocence will then be Virtue. Oh, if the Selfish knew how much they lost, What would they not endeavour, not endure, To imitate, as far as in them lay, Him who his wisdom and his power employs In making others happy! Hence to the Altar and with Her thou lov'st, With Her who longs to strew thy way with flowers; Nor lose the blessed privilege to give Birth to a Race immortal as Yourselves. Which trained by you, shall make a Heaven on Earth, And tread the path that leads from Earth to Heaven. FROM AN ITALIAN SONNET. Isaid to Time, “This venerable pile, Its floor the earth, its roof the firmament, Whose was it once?” He answered not, but fled Fast as before. I turned to Fame, and asked, “Names such as his, to thee they must be known. Speak!” But she answered only with a sigh, And, musing mournfully, looked on the ground. Then to Oblivion I addressed myself, A dismal phantom, sitting at the gate; And, with a voice as from the grave, he cried, “Whose it was once I care not; now 'tis mine.” WRITTEN IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY. October 10, 1806. Whoe'er thou art, approach, and, with a sigh, Mark where the small remains of Greatness lie. There sleeps the dust of Fox for ever gone; How near the Place where late his glory shone! And, tho' no more ascends the voice of Prayer, Tho' the last footsteps cease to linger there, Still, like an awful Dream that comes again, Alas, at best, as transient and as vain, Still do I see (while thro' the vaults of night The funeral-song once more proclaims the rite) The moving Pomp along the shadowy Aisle, That, like a Darkness, filled the solemn Pile; The illustrious line, that in long order led, Of those, that loved Him living, mourned Him dead; Of those the Few, that for their Country stood Round Him who dared be singularly good; All, of all ranks, that claimed him for their own; And nothing wanting—but Himself alone! Oh say, of Him now rests there but a name; Wont, as He was, to breathe ethereal flame? Friend of the Absent, Guardian of the Dead! Who but would here their sacred sorrows shed? (Such as He shed on Nelson's closing grave; How soon to claim the sympathy He gave!) In Him, resentful of another's wrong, The dumb were eloquent, the feeble strong. Truth from his lips a charm celestial drew— Ah, who so mighty and so gentle too? What tho' with War the madding Nations rung, “Peace,” when He spoke, was ever on his tongue! Amid the frowns of Power, the tricks of State, Fearless, resolved, and negligently great! In vain malignant vapours gathered round; He walked, erect, on consecrated ground. The clouds, that rise to quench the Orb of day, Reflect its splendour, and dissolve away! When in retreat He laid his thunder by, For lettered ease and calm Philosophy, Blest were his hours within the silent grove, Where still his god-like Spirit deigns to rove; Blest by the orphan's smile, the widow's prayer, For many a deed, long done in secret there. There shone his lamp on Homer's hallowed page. There, listening, sate the hero and the sage; And they, by virtue and by blood allied, Whom most He loved, and in whose arms He died. Friend of all Human-kind! not here alone (The voice, that speaks, was not to Thee unknown) Wilt Thou be missed.—O'er every land and sea Long, long shall England be revered in Thee! And, when the Storm is hushed—in distant years— Foes on Thy grave shall meet, and mingle tears! WRITTEN AT DROPMORE, July, 1831. Grenville, to thee my gratitude is due For many an hour of studious musing here, For many a day-dream, such as hovered round Hafiz or Sadi; thro' the golden East, Search where we would, no fairer bowers than these, Thine own creation; where, called forth by thee, “Flowers worthy of Paradise, with rich inlay, Broider the ground,” and every mountain-pine Elsewhere unseen (his birth-place in the clouds, His kindred sweeping with majestic march From cliff to cliff along the snowy ridge Of Caucasus, or nearer yet the Moon) Breathes heavenly music.—Yet much more I owe For what so few, alas, can hope to share, Thy converse; when, among thy books reclined, Or in thy garden-chair that wheels its course Slowly and silently thro' sun and shade, Thou speak'st, as ever thou art wont to do, In the calm temper of philosophy; —Still to delight, instruct, whate'er the theme. WRITTEN AT STRATHFIELD SAYE. These are the groves a grateful people gave For noblest service; and, from age to age, May they, to such as come with listening ear, Relate the story! Sacred is their shade; Sacred the calm they breathe—oh, how unlike What in the field 'twas His so long to know; Where many a mournful, many an anxious thought, Troubling, perplexing, on his weary mind Preyed, ere to arms the morning-trumpet called; Where, till the work was done and darkness fell, Blood ran like water, and, go where thou wouldst Death in thy path-way met thee, face to face. For on, regardless of himself, He went; And, by no change elated or depressed, Fought, till he won th' imperishable wreath, Leading the conquerors captive; on he went, Bating nor heart nor hope, whoe'er opposed; The greatest warriors, in their turn, appearing; The last that came, the greatest of them all— One scattering hosts as born but to subdue, And even in bondage withering hearts with fear. When such the service, what the recompense? Yet, and I err not, a renown as fair, And fairer still, awaited him at home; Where to the last, day after day, he stood, The party-zeal, that round him raged, restraining; —His not to rest, while his the strength to serve. WRITTEN IN JULY, 1834. Grey, thou hast served, and well, the sacred Cause That Hampden, Sidney died for. Thou hast stood, Scorning all thought of Self, from first to last, Among the foremost in that glorious field; From first to last; and, ardent as thou art, Held on with equal step as best became A lofty mind, loftiest when most assailed; Never, though galled by many a barbed shaft, By many a bitter taunt from friend and foe, Swerving or shrinking. Happy in thy Youth, Thy Youth the dawn of a long summer-day; But in thy Age still happier; thine to earn The gratitude of millions yet unborn; Thine to conduct, through ways how difficult, A mighty people in their march sublime From Good to Better. Great thy recompense, When in their eyes thou read'st what thou hast done; And may'st thou long enjoy it; may'st thou long Preserve for them what still they claim as theirs, That generous fervour and pure eloquence, Thine from thy birth and Nature's noblest gifts, To guard what They have gained! WRITTEN IN 1834. Well, when her day is over, be it said That, though a speck on the terrestrial globe, Found with long search and in a moment lost, She made herself a name—a name to live While science, eloquence, and song divine, And wisdom, in self-government displayed, And valour, such as only in the Free, Shall among men be honoured. Every sea Was covered with her sails; in every port Her language spoken; and, where'er you went, Exploring, to the east or to the west, Even to the rising or the setting day, Her arts and laws and institutes were there, Moving with silent and majestic march, Onward and onward, where no path-way was; There her adventurous sons, like those of old, Founding vast empires —empires in their turn Destined to shine thro' many a distant age With sun-like splendour. Wondrous was her wealth, The world itself her willing tributary; Yet, to accomplish what her soul desired, All was as nothing; and the mightiest kings, Each in his hour of strife exhausted, fallen, Drew strength from Her, their coffers from her own Filled to o'erflowing. When her fleets of war Had swept the main—had swept it and were gone, Gone from the eyes and from the minds of men, Their dreadful errands so entirely done— Up rose her armies; on the land they stood, Fearless, erect; and in an instant smote Him with his legions. Yet ere long 'twas hers, Great as her triumphs, to eclipse them all, To do what none had done, none had conceived, An act how glorious, making joy in Heaven; When, such her prodigality, condemned To toil and toil, alas, how hopelessly, Herself in bonds, for ages unredeemed— As with a god-like energy she sprung, All else forgot, and, burdened as she was, Ransomed the African. ITALY. PREFACE. In this Poem the Author has endeavoured to describe his Journey through a beautiful country; and it may not perhaps be uninteresting to those who have learnt to live in Past Times as well as Present, and whose minds are familiar with the Events and the People that have rendered Italy so illustrious; for, wherever he came, he could not but remember; nor is he conscious of having slept over any ground that has been “dignified by wisdom, bravery, or virtue.” Much of it was originally published as it was written on the spot. He has since, on a second visit, revised it throughout, and added many stories from the old Chroniclers and many Notes illustrative of the manners, customs, and superstitions there. THE LAKE OF GENEVA. Day glimmered in the east, and the white Moon Hung like a vapour in the cloudless sky, Yet visible, when on my way I went, Glad to be gone; a pilgrim from the North, Now more and more attracted as I drew Nearer and nearer. Ere the artizan Had from his window leant, drowsy, half-clad, To snuff the morn, or the caged lark poured forth, From his green sod upspringing as to heaven, (His tuneful bill o'erflowing with a song Old in the days of Homer, and his wings With transport quivering) on my way I went, Thy gates, Geneva, swinging heavily, Thy gates so slow to open, swift to shut; As on that Sabbath-eve when He arrived, Whose name is now thy glory, now by thee, Such virtue dwells in those small syllables, Inscribed to consecrate the narrow street, His birth-place,—when, but one short step too late, In his despair, as though the die were cast, He flung him down to weep, and wept till dawn; Then rose to go, a wanderer through the world. 'Tis not a tale that every hour brings with it. Yet at a City-gate, from time to time, Much may be learnt; nor, London, least at thine, Thy hive the busiest, greatest of them all, Gathering, enlarging still. Let us stand by, And note who passes. Here comes one, a Youth, Glowing with pride, the pride of conscious power, A Chatterton—in thought admired, caressed, And crowned like Petrarch in the Capitol; Ere long to die, to fall by his own hand, And fester with the vilest. Here come two, Less feverish, less exalted—soon to part, A Garrick and a Johnson; Wealth and Fame Awaiting one, even at the gate; Neglect And Want the other. But what multitudes, Urged by the love of change, and, like myself, Adventurous, careless of to-morrow's fare, Press on—though but a rill entering the sea, Entering and lost! Our task would never end. Day glimmered and I went, a gentle breeze Ruffling the Leman Lake. Wave after wave, If such they might be called, dashed as in sport, Not anger, with the pebbles on the beach Making wild music, and far westward caught The sun-beam—where, alone and as entranced, Counting the hours, the fisher in his skiff Lay with his circular and dotted line On the bright waters. When the heart of man Is light with hope, all things are sure to please; And soon a passage-boat swept gaily by, Laden with peasant-girls and fruits and flowers, And many a chanticleer and partlet caged For Vevey's market-place—a motley group Seen through the silvery haze. But soon 'twas gone. The shifting sail flapped idly to and fro, Then bore them off. I am not one of those So dead to all things in this visible world, So wondrously profound, as to move on In the sweet light of heaven, like him of old (His name is justly in the Calendar) Who through the day pursued this pleasant path That winds beside the mirror of all beauty, And, when at eve his fellow-pilgrims sate, Discoursing of the lake, asked where it was. They marvelled, as they might; and so must all, Seeing what now I saw: for now 'twas day, And the bright Sun was in the firmament, A thousand shadows of a thousand hues Chequering the clear expanse. Awhile his orb Hung o'er thy trackless fields of snow, Mont Blanc, Thy seas of ice and ice-built promontories, That change their shapes for ever as in sport; Then travelled onward and went down behind The pine-clad heights of Jura, lighting up The woodman's casement, and perchance his axe Borne homeward through the forest in his hand; And, on the edge of some o'erhanging cliff, That dungeon-fortress never to be named, Where, like a lion taken in the toils, Toussaint breathed out his brave and generous spirit. Little did He, who sent him there to die, Think, when he gave the word, that he himself, Great as he was, the greatest among men, Should in like manner be so soon conveyed Athwart the deep,—and to a rock so small Amid the countless multitude of waves, That ships have gone and sought it, and returned, Saying it was not! MEILLERIE. These grey majestic cliffs that tower to heaven, These glimmering glades and open chestnut groves, That echo to the heifer's wandering bell, Or woodman's axe, or steersman's song beneath, As on he urges his fir-laden bark, Or shout of goat-herd boy above them all, Who loves not? And who blesses not the light, When thro' some loop-hole he surveys the lake Blue as a sapphire-stone, and richly set With chateaux, villages, and village-spires, Orchards and vineyards, alps and alpine snows? Here would I dwell; nor visit, but in thought, Ferney far south, silent and empty now As now thy once-luxurious bowers, Ripaille; Vevey, so long an exiled Patriot's home; Or Chillon's dungeon-floors beneath the wave, Channelled and worn by pacing to and fro; Lausanne, where Gibbon in his sheltered walk Nightly called up the Shade of ancient Rome; Or Coppet, and that dark untrodden grove Sacred to Virtue, and a daughter's tears! Here would I dwell, forgetting and forgot; And oft methinks (of such strange potency The spells that Genius scatters where he will) Oft should I wander forth like one in search, And say, half-dreaming, “Here St. Preux has stood!” Then turn and gaze on Clarens. Yet there is, Within an eagle's flight and less, a scene Still nobler if not fairer (once again Would I behold it ere these eyes are closed, For I can say; “I also have been there!”) That Sacred Lake withdrawn among the hills, Its depth of waters flanked as with a wall Built by the Giant-race before the flood; Where not a cross or chapel but inspires Holy delight, lifting our thoughts to God From God-like men,—men in a barbarous age That dared assert their birth-right, and displayed Deeds half-divine, returning good for ill; That in the desert sowed the seeds of life, Framing a band of small Republics there, Which still exist, the envy of the world! Who would not land in each, and tread the ground; Land where Tell leaped ashore; and climb to drink Of the three hallowed fountains? He that does, Comes back the better; and relates at home That he was met and greeted by a race Such as he read of in his boyish days; Such as Miltiades at Marathon Led, when he chased the Persians to their ships. There, while the well-known boat is heaving in, Piled with rude merchandise, or launching forth, Thronged with wild cattle for Italian fairs, There in the sunshine, 'mid their native snows, Children, let loose from school, contend to use The cross-bow of their fathers; and o'er-run The rocky field where all, in every age, Assembling sit, like one great family, Forming alliances, enacting laws; Each cliff and head-land and green promontory Graven to their eyes with records of the past That prompt to hero-worship, and excite Even in the least, the lowliest, as he toils, A reverence no where else or felt or feigned; Their chronicler great Nature; and the volume Vast as her works—above, below, around! The fisher on thy beach, Thermopylæ, Asks of the lettered stranger why he came, First from his lips to learn the glorious truth! And who that whets his scythe in Runnemede, Though but for them a slave, recalls to mind The barons in array, with their great charter? Among the everlasting Alps alone, There to burn on as in a sanctuary, Bright and unsullied lives th' ethereal flame; And 'mid those scenes unchanged, unchangeable, Why should it ever die? ST. MAURICE. Still by the Leman Lake, for many a mile, Among those venerable trees I went, Where damsels sit and weave their fishing-nets Singing some national song by the way-side. But now the fly was gone, the gnat was come; Now glimmering lights from cottage-windows broke. 'Twas dusk; and, journeying upward by the Rhone, That there came down, a torrent from the Alps, I entered where a key unlocks a kingdom; The road and river, as they wind along, Filling the mountain-pass. There, till a ray Glanced through my lattice, and the householdstir Warned me to rise, to rise and to depart, A stir unusual, and accompanied With many a tuning of rude instruments, And many a laugh that augured coming pleasure, Mine host's fair daughter for the nuptial rite And nuptial feast attiring—there I slept, And in my dreams wandered once more, well pleased. But now a charm was on the rocks and woods And waters; for, methought, I was with those I had at morn and even wished for there. THE GREAT ST. BERNARD. Night was again descending, when my mule, That all day long had climbed among the clouds, Higher and higher still, as by a stair Let down from heaven itself, transporting me, Stopped, to the joy of both, at that low door, That door which ever, as self-opened, moves To them that knock, and nightly sends abroad Ministering Spirits. Lying on the watch, Two dogs of grave demeanour welcomed me, All meekness, gentleness, though large of limb; And a lay-brother of the Hospital, Who, as we toiled below, had heard by fits The distant echoes gaining on his ear, Came and held fast my stirrup in his hand While I alighted. Long could I have stood, With a religious awe contemplating That House, the highest in the Ancient World, And destined to perform from age to age The noblest service, welcoming as guests All of all nations and of every faith; A temple, sacred to Humanity! It was a pile of simplest masonry, With narrow windows and vast buttresses, Built to endure the shocks of time and chance; Yet showing many a rent, as well it might, Warred on for ever by the elements, And in an evil day, nor long ago, By violent men—when on the mountain-top The French and Austrian banners met in conflict. On the same rock beside it stood the church, Reft of its cross, not of its sanctity; The vesper-bell, for 'twas the vesper-hour, Duly proclaiming through the wilderness, “All ye who hear, whatever be your work, Stop for an instant—move your lips in prayer!” And, just beneath it, in that dreary dale, If dale it might be called, so near to heaven, A little lake, where never fish leaped up, Lay like a spot of ink amid the snow; A star, the only one in that small sky, On its dead surface glimmering. 'Twas a place Resembling nothing I had left behind, As if all worldly ties were now dissolved;— And, to incline the mind still more to thought, To thought and sadness, on the eastern shore Under a beetling cliff stood half in gloom A lonely chapel destined for the dead, For such as, having wandered from their way, Had perished miserably. Side by side, Within they lie, a mournful company, All in their shrouds, no earth to cover them; Their features full of life yet motionless In the broad day, nor soon to suffer change, Though the barred windows, barred against the wolf, Are always open!—But the North blew cold; And, bidden to a spare but cheerful meal, I sate among the holy brotherhood At their long board. The fare indeed was such As is prescribed on days of abstinence, But might have pleased a nicer taste than mine; And through the floor came up, an ancient crone Serving unseen below; while from the roof (The roof, the floor, the walls of native fir,) A lamp hung flickering, such as loves to fling Its partial light on Apostolic heads, And sheds a grace on all. Theirs Time as yet Had changed not. Some were almost in the prime; Nor was a brow o'ercast. Seen as they sate, Ranged round their ample hearth-stone in an hour Of rest, they were as gay, as free from guile, As children; answering, and at once, to all The gentler impulses, to pleasure, mirth; Mingling, at intervals, with rational talk Music; and gathering news from them that came, As of some other world. But when the storm Rose, and the snow rolled on in ocean-waves, When on his face the experienced traveller fell, Sheltering his lips and nostrils with his hands, Then all was changed; and, sallying with their pack Into that blank of nature, they became Unearthly beings. “Anselm, higher up, Just where it drifts, a dog howls loud and long, And now, as guided by a voice from Heaven, Digs with his feet. That noble vehemence Whose can it be, but his who never erred? A man lies underneath! Let us to work!— But who descends Mont Velan? 'Tis La Croix. Away, away! if not, alas, too late. Homeward he drags an old man and a boy, Faltering and falling, and but half awaked, Asking to sleep again.” Such their discourse. Oft has a venerable roof received me; St. Bruno's once —where, when the winds were hushed, Nor from the cataract the voice came up, You might have heard the mole work underground, So great the stillness there; none seen throughout, Save when from rock to rock a hermit crossed By some rude bridge—or one at midnight tolled To matins, and white habits, issuing forth, Glided along those aisles interminable, All, all observant of the sacred law Of Silence. Nor is that sequestered spot, Once called “Sweet Waters,” now “The Shady Vale,” To me unknown; that house so rich of old, So courteous, and, by two that passed that way, Amply requited with immortal verse, The Poet's payment.—But, among them all, None can with this compare, the dangerous seat Of generous, active Virtue. What though Frost Reign everlastingly, and ice and snow Thaw not, but gather—there is that within, Which, where it comes, makes Summer; and, in thought, Oft am I sitting on the bench beneath Their garden-plot, where all that vegetates Is but some scanty lettuce, to observe Those from the South ascending, every step As though it were their last,—and instantly Restored, renewed, advancing as with songs, Soon as they see, turning a lofty crag, That plain, that modest structure, promising Bread to the hungry, to the weary rest. THE DESCENT. My mule refreshed—and, let the truth be told, He was nor dull nor contradictory, But patient, diligent, and sure of foot, Shunning the loose stone on the precipice, Snorting suspicion while with sight, smell, touch, Trying, detecting, where the surface smiled; And with deliberate courage sliding down, Where in his sledge the Laplander had turned With looks aghast—my mule refreshed, his bells Gingled once more, the signal to depart, And we set out in the grey light of dawn, Descending rapidly—by waterfalls Fast-frozen, and among huge blocks of ice That in their long career had stopped mid-way. At length, unchecked, unbidden, he stood still; And all his bells were muffled. Then my Guide, Lowering his voice, addressed me: “Thro' this Gap On and say nothing—lest a word, a breath Bring down a winter's snow—enough to whelm The armed files that, night and day, were seen Winding from cliff to cliff in loose array To conquer at Marengo. Though long since, Well I remember how I met them here, As the sun set far down, purpling the west; And how Napoleon, he himself, no less, Wrapt in his cloak—I could not be deceived— Reined in his horse, and asked me, as I passed, How far 'twas to St. Remi. Where the rock Juts forward, and the road, crumbling away, Narrows almost to nothing at the base, 'Twas there; and down along the brink he led To Victory!—Desaix, who turned the scale, Leaving his life-blood in that famous field, (When the clouds break, we may discern the spot In the blue haze) sleeps, as you saw at dawn, Just where we entered, in the Hospital-church.” So saying, for a while he held his peace, Awe-struck beneath that dreadful Canopy; But soon, the danger passed, launched forth again. JORASSE. Jorasse was in his three-and-twentieth year; Graceful and active as a stag just roused; Gentle withal, and pleasant in his speech, Yet seldom seen to smile. He had grown up Among the hunters of the Higher Alps; Had caught their starts and fits of thoughtfulness, Their haggard looks, and strange soliloquies, Arising (so say they that dwell below) From frequent dealings with the Mountain-Spirits. But other ways had taught him better things; And now he numbered, marching by my side, The great, the learned, that with him had crossed The frozen tract—with him familiarly Thro' the rough day and rougher night conversed In many a chalet round the Peak of Terror, Round Tacul, Tour, Well-horn, and Rosenlau, And Her, whose throne is inaccessible, Who sits, withdrawn in virgin-majesty, Nor oft unveils. Anon an Avalanche Rolled its long thunder; and a sudden crash, Sharp and metallic, to the startled ear Told that far-down a continent of Ice Had burst in twain. But he had now begun; And with what transport he recalled the hour When, to deserve, to win his blooming bride, Madeleine of Annecy, to his feet he bound The iron crampons, and, ascending, trod The Upper Realms of Frost; then, by a cord Let half-way down, entered a grot star-bright, And gathered from above, below, around, The pointed crystals!—Once, nor long before, (Thus did his tongue run on, fast as his feet, And with an eloquence that Nature gives To all her children—breaking off by starts Into the harsh and rude, oft as the Mule Drew his displeasure), once, nor long before, Alone at day-break on the Mettenberg, He slipped and fell; and, through a fearful cleft Gliding insensibly from ledge to ledge, From deep to deeper and to deeper still, Went to the Under-world! Long-while he lay Upon his rugged bed—then waked like one Wishing to sleep again and sleep for ever! For, looking round, he saw or thought he saw Innumerable branches of a Cave, Winding beneath that solid Crust of Ice; With here and there a rent that showed the stars! What then, alas, was left him but to die? What else in those immeasurable chambers, Strewn with the bones of miserable men, Lost like himself? Yet must he wander on, Till cold and hunger set his spirit free! And, rising, he began his dreary round; When hark, the noise as of some mighty Flood Working its way to light! Back he withdrew, But soon returned, and, fearless from despair, Dashed down the dismal Channel; and all day, If day could be where utter darkness was, Travelled incessantly; the craggy roof Just over-head, and the impetuous waves, Nor broad nor deep, yet with a giant's strength, Lashing him on. At last as in a pool The water slept; a pool sullen, profound, Where, if a billow chanced to heave and swell, It broke not; and the roof, descending, lay Flat on the surface. Statue-like he stood, His journey ended; when a ray divine Shot through his soul, Breathing a prayer to Her Whose ears are never shut, the blessed Virgin, He plunged and swam—and in an instant rose, The barrier passed, in sunshine! Through a vale, Such as in Arcady, where many a thatch Gleams thro' the trees, half-seen and half-embowered, Glittering the river ran; and on the bank The Young were dancing ('twas a festival-day) All in their best attire. There first he saw His Madeleine. In the crowd she stood to hear, When all drew round, inquiring; and her face, Seen behind all and varying, as he spoke, With hope and fear and generous sympathy, Subdued him. From that very hour he loved. The tale was long, but coming to a close, When his wild eyes flashed fire; and, all forgot, He listened and looked up. I looked up too; And twice there came a hiss that thro' me thrilled! 'Twas heard no more. A Chamois on the cliff Had roused his fellows with that cry of fear, And all were gone. But now the theme was changed; And he recounted his hair-breadth escapes, When with his friend, Hubert of Bionnay, (His ancient carbine from his shoulder slung, His axe to hew a stair-way in the ice) He tracked their wanderings. By a cloud surprised, Where the next step had plunged them into air, Long had they stood, locked in each other's arms, Amid the gulfs that yawned to swallow them; Each guarding each through many a freezing hour, As on some temple's highest pinnacle, From treacherous slumber. Oh, it was a sport Dearer than life, and but with life relinquished! “My sire, my grandsire died among these wilds. As for myself,” he cried, and he held forth His wallet in his hand, “this do I call My winding-sheet—for I shall have no other!” And he spoke truth. Within a little month He lay among these awful solitudes, ('Twas on a glacier—half-way up to heaven) Taking his final rest. Long did his wife, Suckling her babe, her only one, look out The way he went at parting, but he came not; Long fear to close her eyes, from dusk till dawn Plying her distaff through the silent hours, Lest he appear before her—lest in sleep, If sleep steal on, he come as all are wont, Frozen and ghastly blue or black with gore, To plead for the last rite. MARGUERITE DE TOURS. Now the grey granite, starting through the snow, Discovered many a variegated moss That to the pilgrim resting on his staff Shadows out capes and islands; and ere long Numberless flowers, such as disdain to live In lower regions, and delighted drink The clouds before they fall, flowers of all hues, With their diminutive leaves covered the ground. There, turning by a venerable larch, Shivered in two yet most majestical With his long level branches, we observed A human figure sitting on a stone Far down by the way-side—just where the rock Is riven asunder, and the Evil One Has bridged the gulf, a wondrous monument Built in one night, from which the flood beneath, Raging along, all foam, is seen not heard, And seen as motionless!—Nearer we drew; And lo, a woman young and delicate, Wrapt in a russet cloak from head to foot, Her eyes cast down, her cheek upon her hand, In deepest thought. Over her tresses fair, Young as she was, she wore the matron-cap; And, as we judged, not many moons would change Ere she became a mother. Pale she looked, Yet cheerful; though, methought, once, if not twice, She wiped away a tear that would be coming; And in those moments her small hat of straw, Worn on one side, and glittering with a band Of silk and gold, but ill concealed a face Not soon to be forgotten. Rising up On our approach, she travelled slowly on; And my companion, long before we met, Knew, and ran down to greet her.—She was born (Such was her artless tale, told with fresh tears) In Val d'Aosta; and an Alpine stream, Leaping from crag to crag in its short course To join the Dora, turned her father's mill. There did she blossom, till a Valaisan, A townsman of Martigny, won her heart, Much to the old man's grief. Long he refused, Loth to be left; disconsolate at the thought. She was his only one, his link to life; And in despair—year after year gone by— One summer-morn, they stole a match and fled. The act was sudden; and, when far away, Her spirit had misgivings. Then, full oft, She pictured to herself that aged face Sickly and wan, in sorrow, not in wrath; And, when at last she heard his hour was near, Went forth unseen, and, burdened as she was, Crossed the high Alps on foot to ask forgiveness, And hold him to her heart before he died. Her task was done. She had fulfilled her wish, And now was on her way, rejoicing, weeping. A frame like hers had suffered; but her love Was strong within her; and right on she went, Fearing no ill. May all good Angels guard her! And should I once again, as once I may, Visit Martigny, I will not forget Thy hospitable roof, Marguerite de Tours; Thy sign the silver swan. Heaven prosper thee! THE BROTHERS. In the same hour the breath of life receiving, They came together and were beautiful; But, as they slumbered in their mother's lap, How mournful was their beauty! She would sit, And look and weep, and look and weep again; For Nature had but half her work achieved, Denying, like a step-dame, to the babes Her noblest gifts; denying speech to one, And to the other—reason. But at length (Seven years gone by, seven melancholy years) Another came, as fair and fairer still; And then, how anxiously the mother watched Till reason dawned and speech declared itself! Reason and speech were his; and down she knelt, Clasping her hands in silent ecstasy. On the hill-side, where still their cottage stands, ('Tis near the upper falls in Lauterbrunn; For there I sheltered now, their frugal hearth Blazing with mountain-pine when I appeared, And there, as round they sate, I heard their story) On the hill-side, among the cataracts, In happy ignorance the children played; Alike unconscious, through their cloudless day, Of what they had and had not; every where Gathering rock-flowers; or, with their utmost might, Loosening the fragment from the precipice, And, as it tumbled, listening for the plunge; Yet, as by instinct, at the customed hour Returning; the two eldest, step by step, Lifting along, and with the tenderest care, Their infant brother. Once the hour was past; And, when She sought, she sought and could not find; And when she found—Where was the little one? Alas, they answered not; yet still she asked, Still in her grief forgetting. With a scream, Such as an Eagle sends forth when he soars, A scream that through the wild scatters dismay, The idiot-boy looked up into the sky, And leaped and laughed aloud and leaped again; As if he wished to follow in its flight Something just gone, and gone from earth to heaven: While he, whose every gesture, every look Went to the heart, for from the heart it came, He who nor spoke nor heard—all things to him, Day after day, as silent as the grave, (To him unknown the melody of birds, Of waters—and the voice that should have soothed His infant sorrows, singing him to sleep) Fled to her mantle as for refuge there, And, as at once o'ercome with fear and grief, Covered his head and wept. A dreadful thought Flashed thro' her brain. “Has not some bird of prey, Thirsting to dip his beak in innocent blood— It must, it must be so!”—And so it was. There was an Eagle that had long acquired Absolute sway, the lord of a domain Savage, sublime; nor from the hills alone Gathering large tribute, but from every vale; Making the ewe, whene'er he deigned to stoop, Bleat for the lamb. Great was the recompense Assured to him who laid the tyrant low; And near his nest in that eventful hour, Calmly and patiently, a hunter stood, A hunter, as it chanced, of old renown, And, as it chanced, their father. In the South A speck appeared, enlarging; and ere long, As on his journey to the golden sun, Upward He came, the Felon in his flight, Ascending through the congregated clouds, That, like a dark and troubled sea, obscured The world beneath.—“But what is in his grasp? Ha! 'tis a child—and may it not be ours? I dare not, cannot; and yet why forbear, When, if it lives, a cruel death awaits it?— May He who winged the shaft when Tell stood forth And shot the apple from the youngling's head, Grant me the strength, the courage!” As he spoke, He aimed, he fired; and at his feet they fell, The Eagle and the child—the child unhurt— Tho', such the grasp, not even in death relinquished. THE ALPS. Who first beholds those everlasting clouds, Seed-time and harvest, morning noon and night, Still where they were, steadfast, immovable; Those mighty hills, so shadowy, so sublime, As rather to belong to Heaven than Earth— But instantly receives into his soul A sense, a feeling that he loses not, A something that informs him 'tis an hour, Whence he may date henceforward and for ever. To me they seemed the barriers of a World, Saying, Thus far, no further! and as o'er The level plain I travelled silently, Nearing them more and more, day after day, My wandering thoughts my only company, And they before me still—oft as I looked, A strange delight was mine, mingled with fear, A wonder as at things I had not heard of! And still and still I felt as if I gazed For the first time!—Great was the tumult there, Deafening the din, when in barbaric pomp The Carthaginian on his march to Rome Entered their fastnesses. Trampling the snows, The war-horse reared; and the towered elephant Upturned his trunk into the murky sky, Then tumbled headlong, swallowed up and lost, He and his rider. Now the scene is changed; And o'er the Simplon, o'er the Splügen winds A path of pleasure. Like a silver zone Flung about carelessly, it shines afar, Catching the eye in many a broken link, In many a turn and traverse as it glides; And oft above and oft below appears, Seen o'er the wall by him who journeys up, As if it were another, through the wild Leading along he knows not whence or whither. Yet through its fairy-course, go where it will, The torrent stops it not, the rugged rock Opens and lets it in; and on it runs, Winning its easy way from clime to clime Thro' glens locked up before.—Not such my path! The very path for them that dare defy Danger, nor shrink, wear he what shape he will; That o'er the caldron, when the flood boils up, Hang as in air, gazing and shuddering on Till fascination comes and the brain turns! The very path for them, that list, to choose Where best to plant a monumental cross, And live in story like Empedocles; A track for heroes, such as he who came, Ere long, to win, to wear the Iron Crown; And (if aright I judge from what I felt Over the Drance, just where the Abbot fell, Rolled downward in an after-dinner's sleep) The same as Hannibal's. But now 'tis passed, That turbulent Chaos; and the promised land Lies at my feet in all its loveliness! To him who starts up from a terrible dream, And lo, the sun is shining, and the lark Singing aloud for joy, to him is not Such sudden ravishment as now I feel At the first glimpses of fair Italy. COMO. I love to sail along the Larian Lake Under the shore—though not, where'er he dwelt, To visit Pliny; not, in loose attire, When from the bath or from the tennis-court, To catch him musing in his plane-tree walk, Or angling from his window: and, in truth, Could I recall the ages past and play The fool with Time, I should perhaps reserve My leisure for Catullus on his Lake, Though to fare worse, or Virgil at his farm A little further on the way to Mantua. But such things cannot be. So I sit still, And let the boatman shift his little sail, His sail so forked and so swallow-like, Well-pleased with all that comes. The morning-air Plays on my cheek how gently, flinging round A silvery gleam: and now the purple mists Rise like a curtain; now the sun looks out, Filling, o'erflowing with his glorious light This noble amphitheatre of hills; And now appear as on a phosphor-sea Numberless barks, from Milan, from Pavía; Some sailing up, some down, and some at rest, Lading, unlading at that small port-town Under the promontory—its tall tower And long flat roofs, just such as Gaspar drew, Caught by a sun-beam slanting through a cloud; A quay-like scene, glittering and full of life, And doubled by reflection. What delight, After so long a sojourn in the wild, To hear once more the peasant at his work! —But in a clime like this where is he not? Along the shores, among the hills 'tis now The hey-day of the Vintage; all abroad, But most the young and of the gentler sex, Busy in gathering; all among the vines, Some on the ladder and some underneath, Filling their baskets of green wicker-work, While many a canzonet and frolic laugh Come thro' the leaves; the vines in light festoons From tree to tree, the trees in avenues, And every avenue a covered walk Hung with black clusters. 'Tis enough to make The sad man merry, the benevolent one Melt into tears—so general is the joy! While up and down the cliffs, over the lake, Wains oxen-drawn and panniered mules are seen, Laden with grapes and dropping rosy wine. Here I received from thee, Basílico, One of those courtesies so sweet, so rare! When, as I rambled through thy vineyard-ground On the hill-side, thy little son was sent, Charged with a bunch almost as big as he, To press it on the stranger. May thy vats O'erflow, and he, thy willing gift-bearer, Live to become a giver; and, at length, When thou art full of honour and wouldst rest, The staff of thine old age! In a strange land Such things, however trivial, reach the heart, And thro' the heart the head, clearing away The narrow notions that grow up at home, And in their place grafting Good-Will to All. At least I found it so, nor less at eve, When, bidden as a lonely traveller, ('Twas by a little boat that gave me chase With oar and sail, as homeward-bound I crossed The bay of Tramezzine,) right readily I turned my prow and followed, landing soon Where steps of purest marble met the wave; Where, through the trellises and corridors, Soft music came as from Armida's palace, Breathing enchantment o'er the woods and waters; And thro' a bright pavilion, bright as day, Forms such as hers were flitting, lost among Such as of old in sober pomp swept by, Such as adorn the triumphs and the feasts By Paolo painted; where a Fairy-Queen, That night her birth-night, from her throne received (Young as she was, no floweret in her crown, Hyacinth or rose, so fair and fresh as she) Our willing vows, and by the fountain-side Led in the dance, disporting as she pleased, Under a starry sky—while I looked on, As in a glade of Cashmere or Shiràz, Reclining, quenching my sherbet in snow, And reading in the eyes that sparkled round, The thousand love-adventures written there. Can I forget—no never, such a scene So full of witchery. Night lingered still, When with a dying breeze I left Bellaggio; But the strain followed me; and still I saw Thy smile, Angelica; and still I heard Thy voice—once and again bidding adieu. BERGAMO. The song was one that I had heard before, But where I knew not. It inclined to sadness; And, turning round from the delicious fare My landlord's little daughter Barbara Had from her apron just rolled out before me, Figs and rock-melons—at the door I saw Two boys of lively aspect. Peasant-like They were, and poorly clad, but not unskilled; With their small voices and an old guitar Winning their way to my unguarded heart In that, the only universal tongue. But soon they changed the measure, entering on A pleasant dialogue of sweet and sour, A war of words, with looks and gestures waged Between Trappanti and his ancient dame, Mona Lucilia. To and fro it went; While many a titter on the stairs was heard, And Barbara's among them. When it ceased, Their dark eyes flashed no longer, yet, methought, In many a glance as from the soul, disclosed More than enough to serve them. Far or near, Few looked not for their coming ere they came, Few, when they went, but looked till they were gone; And not a matron, sitting at her wheel, But could repeat their story. Twins they were, And orphans, as I learnt, cast on the world; Their parents lost in an old ferry-boat That, three years since, last Martinmas, went down, Crossing the rough Benacus.—May they live Blameless and happy—rich they cannot be, Like him who, in the days of Minstrelsy, Came in a beggar's weeds to Petrarch's door, Asking, beseeching for a lay to sing, And soon in silk (such then the power of song) Returned to thank him; or like that old man, Old, not in heart, who by the torrent-side Descending from the Tyrol, as Night fell, Knocked at a City-gate near the hill-foot, The gate that bore so long, sculptured in stone, An eagle on a ladder, and at once Found welcome—nightly in the bannered hall Tuning his harp to tales of Chivalry Before the great Mastino, and his guests, The three-and-twenty kings, by adverse fate, By war or treason or domestic strife, Reft of their kingdoms, friendless, shelterless, And living on his bounty. But who comes, Brushing the floor with what was once, methinks, A hat of ceremony? On he glides, Slip-shod, ungartered; his long suit of black Dingy, thread-bare, tho', patch by patch, renewed Till it has almost ceased to be the same. At length arrived, and with a shrug that pleads “'Tis my necessity!” he stops and speaks, Screwing a smile into his dinnerless face. “Blame not a Poet, Signor, for his zeal— When all are on the wing, who would be last? The splendour of thy name has gone before thee; And Italy from sea to sea exults, As well indeed she may! But I transgress. He, who has known the weight of Praise himself, Should spare another.” Saying so, he laid His sonnet, an impromptu, at my feet, (If his, then Petrarch must have stolen it from him) And bowed and left me; in his hollow hand Receiving my small tribute, a zecchine, Unconsciously, as doctors do their fees. My omelet, and a flagon of hill-wine, Pure as the virgin-spring, had happily Fled from all eyes; or, in a waking dream, I might have sat as many a great man has, And many a small, like him of Santillane, Bartering my bread and salt for empty praise. ITALY. Am I in Italy? Is this the Mincius? Are those the distant turrets of Verona? And shall I sup where Juliet at the Masque Saw her loved Montague, and now sleeps by him? Such questions hourly do I ask myself; And not a stone, in a cross-way, inscribed “To Mantua”—“To Ferrara”—but excites Surprise, and doubt, and self-congratulation. O Italy, how beautiful thou art! Yet I could weep—for thou art lying, alas, Low in the dust; and we admire thee now As we admire the beautiful in death. Thine was a dangerous gift, when thou wert born, The gift of Beauty. Would thou hadst it not; Or wert as once, awing the caitiffs vile That now beset thee, making thee their slave! Would they had loved thee less, or feared thee more! —But why despair? Twice hast thou lived already; Twice shone among the nations of the world, As the sun shines among the lesser lights Of heaven; and shalt again. The hour shall come, When they who think to bind the ethereal spirit, Who, like the eagle cowering o'er his prey, Watch with quick eye, and strike and strike again If but a sinew vibrate, shall confess Their wisdom folly. Even now the flame Bursts forth where once it burnt so gloriously, And, dying, left a splendour like the day, That like the day diffused itself, and still Blesses the earth—the light of genius, virtue, Greatness in thought and act, contempt of death, God-like example. Echoes that have slept Since Athens, Lacedæmon, were Themselves, Since men invoked “By those in Marathon!” Awake along the Ægean; and the dead, They of that sacred shore, have heard the call, And thro' the ranks, from wing to wing, are seen Moving as once they were—instead of rage Breathing deliberate valour. COLL'ALTO. In this neglected mirror (the broad frame Of massy silver serves to testify That many a noble matron of the house Has sat before it) once, alas, was seen What led to many sorrows. From that time The bat came hither for a sleeping place; And he, who cursed another in his heart, Said, ‘Be thy dwelling, thro' the day and night, Shunned like Coll'alto.’”—'Twas in that old Pile, Which flanks the cliff with its grey battlements Flung here and there, and, like an eagle's nest, Hangs in the Trevisan, that thus the Steward, Shaking his locks, the few that Time had left, Addressed me, as we entered what was called “My Lady's Chamber.” On the walls, the chairs, Much yet remained of the rich tapestry; Much of the adventures of Sir Lancelot In the green glades of some enchanted wood. The toilet-table was of silver wrought, Florentine Art, when Florence was renowned; A gay confusion of the elements, Dolphins and boys, and shells and fruits and flowers: And from the ceiling, in his gilded cage, Hung a small bird of curious workmanship, That, when his Mistress bade him, would unfold (So says the babbling Dame, Tradition, there) His emerald-wings, and sing and sing again The song that pleased her. While I stood and looked, A gleam of day yet lingering in the West, The Steward went on. “She had ('tis now long since) A gentle serving-maid, the fair Cristine, Fair as a lily, and as spotless too; None so admired, beloved. They had grown up As play-fellows; and some there were, that said, Some that knew much, discoursing of Cristine, ‘She is not what she seems.’ When unrequired, She would steal forth; her custom, her delight, To wander thro' and thro' an ancient grove Self-planted half-way down, losing herself Like one in love with sadness; and her veil And vesture white, seen ever in that place, Ever as surely as the hours came round, Among those reverend trees, gave her below The name of The White Lady. But the day Is gone, and I delay thee. In that chair The Countess, as it might be now, was sitting, Her gentle serving-maid, the fair Cristine, Combing her golden hair; and thro' this door The Count, her lord, was hastening, called away By letters of great urgency to Venice; When in the glass she saw, as she believed, ('Twas an illusion of the Evil One— Some say he came and crossed it at the time) A smile, a glance at parting, given and answered, That turned her blood to gall. That very night The deed was done. That night, ere yet the Moon Was up on Monte Calvo, and the wolf Baying as still he does (oft is he heard, An hour and more, by the old turret-clock) They led her forth, the unhappy lost Cristine, Helping her down in her distress—to die. “No blood was spilt; no instrument of death Lurked—or stood forth, declaring its bad purpose; Nor was a hair of her unblemished head Hurt in that hour. Fresh as a flower just blown, And warm with life, her youthful pulses playing, She was walled up within the Castle-wall. The wall itself was hollowed secretly; Then closed again, and done to line and rule. Would'st thou descend?—'Tis in a darksome vault Under the Chapel: and there nightly now, As in the narrow niche, when smooth and fair, And as if nothing had been done or thought, The stone-work rose before her, till the light Glimmered and went—there, nightly at that hour, (Thou smil'st, and would it were an idle tale!) In her white veil and vesture white she stands Shuddering—her eyes uplifted, and her hands Joined as in prayer; then, like a Blessed Soul Bursting the tomb, springs forward, and away Flies o'er the woods and mountains. Issuing forth, The hunter meets her in his hunting-track; The shepherd on the heath, starting, exclaims (For still she bears the name she bore of old) ‘'Tis the White Lady!’” VENICE. There is a glorious City in the Sea. The Sea is in the broad, the narrow streets, Ebbing and flowing; and the salt sea-weed Clings to the marble of her palaces. No track of men, no footsteps to and fro, Lead to her gates. The path lies o'er the Sea, Invisible; and from the land we went, As to a floating City—steering in, And gliding up her streets as in a dream, So smoothly, silently—by many a dome, Mosque-like, and many a stately portico, The statues ranged along an azure sky; By many a pile in more than Eastern pride, Of old the residence of merchant-kings; The fronts of some, though Time had shattered them, Still glowing with the richest hues of art, As though the wealth within them had run o'er. Thither I came, and in a wondrous Ark, (That, long before we slipt our cable, rang As with the voices of all living things) From Padua, where the stars are, night by night, Watched from the top of an old dungeon-tower, Whence blood ran once, the tower of Ezzelin— Not as he watched them, when he read his fate And shuddered. But of him I thought not then, Him or his horoscope; far, far from me The forms of Guilt and Fear; tho' some were there, Sitting among us round the cabin-board, Some who, like him, had cried, “Spill blood enough!” And could shake long at shadows. They had played Their parts at Padua, and were floating home, Careless and full of mirth; to-morrow a day Not in their Calendar.—Who in a strain To make the hearer fold his arms and sigh, Sings, “Caro, Caro!”—'Tis the Prima Donna, And to her monkey, smiling in his face, Who, as transported, cries, “Brava! Ancora!” 'Tis a grave personage, an old macaw, Perched on her shoulder.—But who leaps ashore, And with a shout urges the lagging mules; Then climbs a tree that overhangs the stream, And like an acorn, drops on deck again? 'Tis he who speaks not, stirs not, but we laugh; That child of fun and frolic, Arlecchino. And mark their Poet—with what emphasis He prompts the young Soubrette, conning her part! Her tongue plays truant, and he raps his box, And prompts again; for ever looking round As if in search of subjects for his wit, His satire; and as often whispering Things, though unheard, not unimaginable. Had I thy pencil, Crabbe (when thou hast done, Late may it be ... it will, like Prospero's staff, Be buried fifty fathoms in the earth) I would portray the Italian—Now I cannot. Subtle, discerning, eloquent, the slave Of Love, of Hate, for ever in extremes; Gentle when unprovoked, easily won, But quick in quarrel—through a thousand shades His spirit flits, cameleon-like, and mocks The eye of the observer. Gliding on, At length we leave the river for the sea. At length a voice aloft proclaims “Venezia!” And, as called forth, She comes. A few in fear, Flying away from him whose boast it was, That the grass grew not where his horse had trod, Gave birth to Venice. Like the water-fowl, They built their nests among the ocean-waves; And where the sands were shifting, as the wind Blew from the north or south—where they that came, Had to make sure the ground they stood upon, Rose, like an exhalation from the deep, A vast Metropolis, with glistering spires, With theatres, basilicas adorned; A scene of light and glory, a dominion, That has endured the longest among men. And whence the talisman, whereby she rose, Towering? 'Twas found there in the barren sea. Want led to Enterprise; and, far or near, Who met not the Venetian?—now among The Ægean Isles, steering from port to port, Landing and bartering; now, no stranger there, In Cairo, or without the eastern gate, Ere yet the Cafila came, listening to hear Its bells approaching from the Red-Sea coast; Then on the Euxine, and that smaller Sea Of Azoph, in close converse with the Russ, And Tartar; on his lowly deck receiving Pearls from the Persian Gulf, gems from Golconde; Eyes brighter yet, that shed the light of love, From Georgia, from Circassia. Wandering round, When in the rich bazaar he saw, displayed, Treasures from climes unknown, he asked and learnt, And, travelling slowly upward, drew ere long From the well-head, supplying all below; Making the Imperial City of the East, Herself, his tributary.—If we turn To those black forests, where, through many an age, Night without day, no axe the silence broke, Or seldom, save where Rhine or Danube rolled; Where o'er the narrow glen a castle hangs, And, like the wolf that hungered at his door, The baron lived by rapine—there we meet, In warlike guise, the Caravan from Venice; When on its march, now lost and now beheld, A glittering file (the trumpet heard, the scout Sent and recalled) but at a city-gate All gaiety, and looked for ere it comes; Winning regard with all that can attract, Cages, whence every wild cry of the desert, Jugglers, stage-dancers. Well might Charlemain, And his brave peers, each with his visor up, On their long lances lean and gaze awhile, When the Venetian to their eyes disclosed The wonders of the East! Well might they then Sigh for new Conquests! Thus did Venice rise, Thus flourish, till the unwelcome tidings came, That in the Tagus had arrived a fleet From India, from the region of the Sun, Fragrant with spices—that a way was found, A channel opened, and the golden stream Turned to enrich another. Then she felt Her strength departing, yet awhile maintained Her state, her splendour; till a tempest shook All things most held in honour among men, All that the giant with the scythe had spared, To their foundations, and at once she fell; She who had stood yet longer than the last Of the Four Kingdoms—who, as in an Ark, Had floated down, amid a thousand wrecks, Uninjured, from the Old World to the New, From the last glimpse of civilized life—to where Light shone again, and with the blaze of noon. Through many an age in the mid-sea she dwelt, From her retreat calmly contemplating The changes of the Earth, herself unchanged. Before her passed, as in an awful dream, The mightiest of the mighty. What are these, Clothed in their purple? O'er the globe they fling Their monstrous shadows; and, while yet we speak, Phantom-like, vanish with a dreadful scream! What—but the last that styled themselves the Cæsars? And who in long array (look where they come; Their gestures menacing so far and wide) Wear the green turban and the heron's plume? Who—but the Caliphs? followed fast by shapes As new and strange—Emperor, and King, and Czar, And Soldan, each, with a gigantic stride, Trampling on all the flourishing works of peace To make his greatness greater, and inscribe His name in blood—some, men of steel, steel-clad; Others, nor long, alas, the interval, In light and gay attire, with brow serene Wielding Jove's thunder, scattering sulphurous fire Mingled with darkness; and, among the rest, Lo, one by one, passing continually, Those who assume a sway beyond them all; Men grey with age, each in a triple crown, And in his tremulous hands grasping the keys That can alone, as he would signify, Unlock Heaven's gate. LUIGI. Happy is he who loves companionship, And lights on thee, Luigi. Thee I found, Playing at Mora on the cabin-roof With Punchinello.—'Tis a game to strike Fire from the coldest heart. What then from thine? And, ere the twentieth throw, I had resolved, Won by thy looks. Thou wert an honest lad; Wert generous, grateful, not without ambition. Had it depended on thy will alone, Thou wouldst have numbered in thy family At least six Doges and the first in fame. But that was not to be. In thee I saw The last, if not the least, of a long line, Who in their forest, for three hundred years, Had lived and laboured, cutting, charring wood; Discovering where they were, to those astray, By the re-echoing stroke, the crash, the fall, Or the blue wreath that travelled slowly up Into the sky. Thy nobler destinies Led thee away to justle in the crowd; And there I found thee—trying once again, What for thyself thou hadst prescribed so oft, A change of air and diet—once again Crossing the sea, and springing to the shore As though thou knewest where to dine and sleep. First in Bologna didst thou plant thyself, Serving behind a Cardinal's gouty chair, Listening and oft replying, jest for jest; Then in Ferrara, everything by turns, So great thy genius and so Proteus-like! Now serenading in a lover's train, And measuring swords with his antagonist; Now carving, cup-bearing in halls of state; And now a guide to the lorn traveller, A very Cicerone—yet, alas, How unlike him who fulmined in old Rome! Dealing out largely in exchange for pence Thy scraps of Knowledge—thro' the grassy street Leading, explaining—pointing to the bars Of Tasso's dungeon, and the Latin verse, Graven in the stone, that yet denotes the door Of Ariosto. Many a year is gone Since on the Rhine we parted; yet, methinks, I can recall thee to the life, Luigi, In our long journey ever by my side; Thy locks jet-black, and clustering round a face Open as day and full of manly daring. Thou hadst a hand, a heart for all that came, Herdsman or pedlar, monk or muleteer; And few there were, that met thee not with smiles. Mishap passed o'er thee like a summer-cloud. Cares thou hadst none; and they, that stood to hear thee, Caught the infection and forgot their own. Nature conceived thee in her merriest mood, Her happiest—not a speck was in the sky; And at thy birth the cricket chirped, Luigi, Thine a perpetual voice—at every turn A larum to the echo. In a clime, Where all were gay, none were so gay as thou; Thou, like a babe, hushed only by thy slumbers; Up hill and down hill, morning, noon and night, Singing or talking; singing to thyself When none gave ear, but to the listener talking. ST. MARK'S PLACE. Over how many tracts, vast, measureless, Ages on ages roll, and none appear Save the wild hunter ranging for his prey; While on this spot of earth, the work of man, How much has been transacted! Emperors, Popes, Warriors, from far and wide, laden with spoil, Landing, have here performed their several parts, Then left the stage to others. Not a stone In the broad pavement, but to him who has An eye, an ear for the Inanimate World, Tells of Past Ages. In that temple-porch (The brass is gone, the porphyry remains,) Did Barbarossa fling his mantle off, And, kneeling, on his neck receive the foot Of the proud Pontiff—thus at last consoled For flight, disguise, and many an anguish shake On his stone pillow. In that temple-porch, Old as he was, so near his hundredth year, And blind—his eyes put out—did Dandolo Stand forth, displaying on his crown the cross. There did he stand, erect, invincible, Though wan his cheeks, and wet with many tears, For in his prayers he had been weeping much; And now the pilgrims and the people wept With admiration, saying in their hearts, “Surely those aged limbs have need of rest!” There did he stand, with his old armour on, Ere, gonfalon in hand, that streamed aloft, As conscious of its glorious destiny, So soon to float o'er mosque and minaret, He sailed away, five hundred gallant ships, Their lofty sides hung with emblazoned shields, Following his track to fame. He went to die; But of his trophies four arrived ere long, Snatched from destruction—the four steeds divine, That strike the ground, resounding with their feet, And from their nostrils snort ethereal flame Over that very porch; and in the place Where in an after-time, beside the Doge, Sate one yet greater, one whose verse shall live, When the wave rolls o'er Venice. High he sate, High over all, close by the ducal chair, At the right hand of his illustrious Host, Amid the noblest daughters of the realm, Their beauty shaded from the western ray By many-coloured hangings; while, beneath, Knights of all nations, some of fair renown From England, from victorious Edward's court, Their lances in the rest, charged for the prize. Here, among other pageants, and how oft It met the eye, borne through the gazing crowd, As if returning to console the least, Instruct the greatest, did the Doge go round; Now in a chair of state, now on his bier. They were his first appearance, and his last. The sea, that emblem of uncertainty, Changed not so fast for many and many an age, As this small spot. To-day 'twas full of masks; And lo, the madness of the Carnival, The monk, the nun, the holy legate masked! To-morrow came the scaffold and the wheel; And he died there by torch-light, bound and gagged, Whose name and crime they knew not. Underneath Where the Archangel, as alighted there, Blesses the City from the topmost-tower, His arms extended—there, in monstrous league, Two phantom-shapes were sitting, side by side, Or up, and, as in sport, chasing each other; Horror and Mirth. Both vanished in one hour! But Ocean only, when again he claims His ancient rule, shall wash away their footsteps. Enter the Palace by the marble stairs Down which the grizzly head of old Falièr Rolled from the block. Pass onward thro' the hall, Where, among those drawn in their ducal robes, But one is wanting—where, thrown off in heat, A brief inscription on the Doge's chair Led to another on the wall as brief; And thou wilt track them—wilt from rooms of state, Where kings have feasted, and the festal song Rung through the fretted roof, cedar and gold, Step into darkness; and be told, “'Twas here, Trusting, deceived, assembled but to die, To take a long embrace and part again, Carrara and his valiant sons were slain; He first—then they, whose only crime had been Struggling to save their Father.”—Thro' that door, So soon to cry, smiting his brow, “I am lost!” Was with all courtesy, all honour, shewn The great and noble captain, Carmagnola.— That deep descent (thou canst not yet discern Aught as it is) leads to the dripping vaults Under the flood, where light and warmth were never! Leads to a covered Bridge, the Bridge of Sighs; And to that fatal closet at the foot, Lurking for prey.— But let us to the roof, And, when thou hast surveyed the sea, the land, Visit the narrow cells that cluster there, As in a place of tombs. There burning suns, Day after day, beat unrelentingly; Turning all things to dust, and scorching up The brain, till Reason fled, and the wild yell And wilder laugh burst out on every side, Answering each other as in mockery! Few Houses of the size were better filled; Though many came and left it in an hour. “Most nights,” so said the good old Nicolo, (For three-and-thirty years his uncle kept The water-gate below, but seldom spoke, Though much was on his mind,) “most nights arrived The prison-boat, that boat with many oars, And bore away as to the Lower World, Disburdening in the Cànal Orfano, That drowning-place, where never net was thrown, Summer or Winter, death the penalty; And where a secret, once deposited, Lay till the waters should give up their dead.” Yet what so gay as Venice? Every gale Breathed music! and who flocked not, while she reigned, To celebrate her Nuptials with the Sea; To wear the mask, and mingle in the crowd With Greek, Armenian, Persian—night and day (There, and there only, did the hour stand still) Pursuing thro' her thousand labyrinths The Enchantress Pleasure; realizing dreams The earliest, happiest—for a tale to catch Credulous ears, and hold young hearts in chains, Had only to begin, “There lived in Venice”— “Who were the Six we supped with Yesternight?” “Kings, one and all! Though couldst not but remark The style and manner of the Six that served them.” “Who answered me just now? Who, when I said, ‘'Tis nine,’ turned round and said so solemnly, ‘Signor, he died at nine!’”—“'Twas the Armenian; The mask that follows thee, go where thou wilt.” “But who moves there, alone among them all?” “The Cypriot. Ministers from distant Courts Beset his doors, long ere his rising-hour; His the Great Secret! Not the golden house Of Nero, nor those fabled in the East, Rich though they were, so wondrous rich as his! Two dogs, coal-black, in collars of pure gold, Walk in his footsteps—Who but his familiars? They walk, and cast no shadow in the sun! And mark Him speaking. They, that listen, stand As if his tongue dropped honey; yet his glance None can endure! He looks nor young nor old; And at a tourney, where I sat and saw, A very child (full threescore years are gone) Borne on my father's shoulder thro' the crowd, He looked not otherwise. Where'er he stops, Tho' short the sojourn, on his chamber-wall, Mid many a treasure gleaned from many a clime, His portrait hangs—but none must notice it; For Titian glows in every lineament, (Where is it not inscribed, The work is his!) And Titian died two hundred years ago.” —Such their discourse. Assembling in St. Mark's, All nations met as on enchanted ground! What tho' a strange my sterious Power was there, Moving throughout, subtle, invisible, And universal as the air they breathed; A Power that never slumbered, nor forgave. All eye, all ear, no where and every where, Entering the closet and the sanctuary, No place of refuge for the Doge himself; Most present when least thought of—nothing dropt In secret, when the heart was on the lips, Nothing in feverish sleep, but instantly Observed and judged — a Power, that if but named In casual converse, be it where it might, The speaker lowered at once his eyes, his voice, And pointed upward as to God in Heaven— What tho' that Power was there, he who lived thus, Pursuing Pleasure, lived as if it were not. But let him in the midnight-air indulge A word, a thought against the laws of Venice, And in that hour he vanished from the earth! THE GONDOLA. Boy, call the Gondola; the sun is set.— It came, and we embarked; but instantly, As at the waving of a magic wand, Though she had stept on board so light of foot, So light of heart, laughing she knew not why, Sleep overcame her; on my arm she slept. From time to time I waked her; but the boat Rocked her to sleep again. The moon was now Rising full-orbed, but broken by a cloud. The wind was hushed, and the sea mirror-like. A single zephyr, as enamoured, played With her loose tresses, and drew more and more Her veil across her bosom. Long I lay Contemplating that face so beautiful, That rosy mouth, that cheek dimpled with smiles, That neck but half-concealed, whiter than snow. 'Twas the sweet slumber of her early age. I looked and looked, and felt a flush of joy I would express but cannot. Oft I wished Gently—by stealth—to drop asleep myself, And to incline yet lower that sleep might come; Oft closed my eyes as in forgetfulness. 'Twas all in vain. Love would not let me rest. But how delightful when at length she waked! When, her light hair adjusting, and her veil So rudely scattered, she resumed her place Beside me; and, as gaily as before, Sitting unconsciously nearer and nearer, Poured out her innocent mind! So, nor long since, Sung a Venetian; and his lay of love, Dangerous and sweet, charmed Venice. For myself. (Less fortunate, if Love be Happiness) No curtain drawn, no pulse beating alarm, I went alone beneath the silent moon; Thy Square, St. Mark, thy churches, palaces, Glittering and frost-like, and, as day drew on, Melting away, an emblem of themselves. Those Porches passed, thro' which the water-breeze Plays, though no longer on the noble forms That moved there, sable-vested—and the Quay, Silent, grass-grown—adventurer-like I launched Into the deep, ere long discovering Isles such as cluster in the Southern seas, All verdure. Every where, from bush and brake, The musky odour of the serpents came; Their slimy tract across the woodman's path Bright in the moonshine; and, as round I went, Dreaming of Greece, whither the waves were gliding, I listened to the venerable pines Then in close converse, and, if right I guessed, Delivering many a message to the Winds, In secret, for their kindred on Mount Ida. Nor when again in Venice, when again In that strange place, so stirring and so still, Where nothing comes to drown the human voice But music, or the dashing of the tide, Ceased I to wander. Now a Jessica Sung to her lute, her signal as she sate At her half-open window. Then, methought, A serenade broke silence, breathing hope Thro' walls of stone, and torturing the proud heart Of some Priuli. Once, we could not err, (It was before an old Palladian house, As between night and day we floated by) A Gondolier lay singing; and he sung, As in the time when Venice was Herself, Of Tancred and Erminia. On our oars We rested; and the verse was verse divine! We could not err—Perhaps he was the last— For none took up the strain, none answered him; And, when he ceased, he left upon my ear A something like the dying voice of Venice! The moon went down; and nothing now was seen Save where the lamp of a Madonna shone Faintly—or heard, but when he spoke, who stood Over the lantern at the prow and cried, Turning the corner of some reverend pile, Some school or hospital of old renown, Tho' haply none were coming, none were near, “Hasten or slacken.” But at length Night fled; And with her fled, scattering, the sons of Pleasure. Star after star shot by, or, meteor-like, Crossed me and vanished—lost at once among Those hundred Isles that tower majestically, That rise abruptly from the water-mark, Not with rough crag, but marble, and the work Of noblest architects. I lingered still; Nor sought my threshold, till the hour was come And past, when, flitting home in the grey light, The young Bianca found her father's door, That door so often with a trembling hand, So often—then so lately left ajar, Shut; and, all terror, all perplexity, Now by her lover urged, now by her love, Fled o'er the waters to return no more. THE BRIDES OF VENICE. It was St. Mary's Eve, and all poured forth For some great festival. The fisher came From his green islet, bringing o'er the waves His wife and little one; the husbandman From the Firm Land, with many a friar and nun, And village-maiden, her first flight from home, Crowding the common ferry. All arrived; And in his straw the prisoner turned to hear, So great the stir in Venice. Old and young Thronged her three hundred bridges; the grave Turk, Turbaned, long-vested, and the cozening Jew In yellow hat and thread-bare gaberdine, Hurrying along. For, as the custom was, The noblest sons and daughters of the State, Whose names are written in the Book of Gold, Were on that day to solemnize their nuptials. At noon a distant murmur through the crowd Rising and rolling on, proclaimed them near; And never from their earliest hour was seen Such splendour or such beauty. Two and two, (The richest tapestry unrolled before them) First came the Brides; each in her virgin-veil, Nor unattended by her bridal maids, The two that, step by step, behind her bore The small but precious caskets that contained The dowry and the presents. On she moved In the sweet seriousness of virgin-youth; Her eyes cast down, and holding in her hand A fan, that gently waved, of ostrich-plumes. Her veil, transparent as the gossamer, Fell from beneath a starry diadem; And on her dazzling neck a jewel shone, Ruby or diamond or dark amethyst; A jewelled chain, in many a winding wreath, Wreathing her gold brocade. Before the Church, That venerable structure now no more On the sea-brink, another train they met, No strangers, nor unlooked for ere they came, Brothers to some, still dearer to the rest; Each in his hand bearing his cap and plume, And, as he walked, with modest dignity Folding his scarlet mantle. At the gate They join; and slowly up the bannered aisle Led by the choir, with due solemnity Range round the altar. In his vestments there The Patriarch stands; and, while the anthem flows, Who can look on unmoved—the dream of years Just now fulfilling! Here a mother weeps, Rejoicing in her daughter. There a son Blesses the day that is to make her his; While she shines forth through all her ornament, Her beauty heightened by her hopes and fears. At length the rite is ending. All fall down, All of all ranks; and, stretching out his hands, Apostle-like, the holy man proceeds To give the blessing—not a stir, a breath; When hark, a din of voices from without, And shrieks and groans and outcries as in battle! And lo, the door is burst, the curtain rent, And armed ruffians, robbers from the deep, Savage, uncouth, led on by Barberigo And his six brothers in their coats of steel, Are standing on the threshold! Statue-like Awhile they gaze on the fallen multitude, Each with his sabre up, in act to strike; Then, as at once recovering from the spell, Rush forward to the altar, and as soon Are gone again—amid no clash of arms Bearing away the maidens and the treasures. Where are they now?—ploughing the distant waves, Their sails outspread and given to the wind, They on their decks triumphant. On they speed, Steering for Istria; their accursed barks (Well are they known, the galliot and the galley) Freighted, alas, with all that life endears! The richest argosies were poor to them! Now hadst thou seen along that crowded shore The matrons running wild, their festal dress A strange and moving contrast to their grief; And through the city, wander where thou wouldst, The men half armed and arming—everywhere As roused from slumber by the stirring trump; One with a shield, one with a casque and spear; One with an axe severing in two the chain Of some old pinnace. Not a raft, a plank, But on that day was drifting. In an hour Half Venice was afloat. But long before, Frantic with grief and scorning all control, The Youths were gone in a light brigantine, Lying at anchor near the Arsenal; Each having sworn, and by the holy rood, To slay or to be slain. And from the tower The watchman gives the signal. In the East A ship is seen, and making for the Port; Her flag St. Mark's. And now she turns the point, Over the waters like a sea-bird flying! Ha, 'tis the same, 'tis theirs! from stern to prow Green with victorious wreaths, she comes to bring All that was lost. Coasting, with narrow search, Friuli—in his spring, like a tiger They had surprised the Corsairs where they lay Sharing the spoil in blind security And casting lots—had slain them, one and all, All to the last, and flung them far and wide Into the sea, their proper element; Him first, as first in rank, whose name so long Had hushed the babes of Venice, and who yet, Breathing a little, in his look retained The fierceness of his soul. Thus were the Brides Lost and recovered; and what now remained But to give Thanks? Twelve breast-plates and twelve crowns, By the young Victors to their Patron-Saint Vowed in the field, inestimable gifts Flaming with gems and gold, were in due time Laid at his feet; and ever to preserve The memory of a day so full of change, From joy to grief, from grief to joy again, Through many an age, as oft as it came round, 'Twas held religiously. The Doge resigned His crimson for pure ermine, visiting At earliest dawn St. Mary's silver shrine; And through the city, in a stately barge Of gold, were borne with songs and symphonies Twelve ladies young and noble. Clad they were In bridal white with bridal ornaments, Each in her glittering veil; and on the deck, As on a burnished throne, they glided by; No window or balcóny but adorned With hangings of rich texture, not a roof But covered with beholders, and the air Vocal with joy. Onward they went, their oars Moving in concert with the harmony, Through the Rialto to the Ducal Palace, And at a banquet, served with honour there, Sat representing, in the eyes of all, Eyes not unwet, I ween, with grateful tears, Their lovely ancestors, the Brides of Venice. FOSCARI. Let us lift up the curtain, and observe What passes in that chamber. Now a sigh, And now a groan is heard. Then all is still. Twenty are sitting as in judgment there; Men who have served their country and grown grey In governments and distant embassies, Men eminent alike in war and peace; Such as in effigy shall long adorn The walls of Venice—to shew what she was! Their garb is black, and black the arras is, And sad the general aspect. Yet their looks Are calm, are cheerful; nothing there like grief, Nothing or harsh or cruel. Still that noise, That low and dismal moaning. Half withdrawn, A little to the left, sits one in crimson, A venerable man, fourscore and five. Cold drops of sweat stand on his furrowed brow. His hands are clenched; his eyes half-shut and glazed; His shrunk and withered limbs rigid as marble. 'Tis Foscari, the Doge. And there is one, A young man, lying at his feet, stretched out In torture. 'Tis his son. 'Tis Giacomo, His only joy (and has he lived for this?) Accused of murder. Yesternight the proofs, If proofs they be, were in the lion's mouth Dropt by some hand unseen; and he, himself, Must sit and look on a beloved son Suffering the Question. Twice to die in peace, To save, while yet he could, a falling house, And turn the hearts of his fell Adversaries, Those who had now, like hell-hounds in full cry, Chased down his last of four, twice did he ask To lay aside the Crown, and they refused, An oath exacting, never more to ask; And there he sits, a spectacle of woe, Condemned in bitter mockery to wear The bauble he had sighed for. Once again The screw is turned; and, as it turns, the Son Looks up, and, in a faint and broken tone, Murmurs “My Father!” The old man shrinks back, And in his mantle muffles up his face. “Art thou not guilty?” says a voice, that once Would greet the Sufferer long before they met, “Art thou not guilty?”—“No! Indeed I am not!” But all is unavailing. In that Court Groans are confessions; Patience, Fortitude, The work of Magic; and, released, revived, For Condemnation, from his Father's lips He hears the sentence, “Banishment to Candia. Death, if he leaves it.” And the bark sets sail; And he is gone from all he loves in life! Gone in the dead of night—unseen of any— Without a word, a look of tenderness, To be called up, when, in his lonely hours, He would indulge in weeping. Like a ghost, Day after day, year after year, he haunts An ancient rampart that o'erhangs the sea; Gazing on vacancy, and hourly there Starting as from some wild and uncouth dream, To answer to the watch.—Alas, how changed From him the mirror of the Youth of Venice; Whom in the slightest thing, or whim or chance, Did he but wear his doublet so and so, All followed; at whose nuptials, when he won That maid at once the noblest, fairest, best, A daughter of the House that now among Its ancestors in monumental brass Numbers eight Doges—to convey her home, The Bùcentaur went forth; and thrice the Sun Shone on the Chivalry, that, front to front, And blaze on blaze reflecting, met and ranged To tourney in St. Mark's.—But lo, at last, Messengers come. He is recalled: his heart Leaps at the tidings. He embarks: the boat Springs to the oar, and back again he goes— Into that very Chamber! there to lie In his old resting-place, the bed of steel; And thence look up (Five long, long years of Grief Have not killed either) on his wretched Sire, Still in that seat—as though he had not stirred; Immovable, and muffled in his cloak. But now he comes, convicted of a crime Great by the laws of Venice. Night and day, Brooding on what he had been, what he was, 'Twas more than he could bear. His longing-fits Thickened upon him. His desire for home Became a madness; and, resolved to go, If but to die, in his despair he writes A letter to the sovereign-prince of Milan, (To him whose name, among the greatest now, Had perished, blotted out at once and rased, But for the rugged limb of an old oak) Soliciting his influence with the State, And drops it to be found.—“Would ye know all? I have transgressed, offended wilfully; And am prepared to suffer as I ought. But let me, let me, if but for an hour, (Ye must consent—for all of you are sons, Most of you husbands, fathers) let me first Indulge the natural feelings of a man, And, ere I die, if such my sentence be, Press to my heart ('tis all I ask of you) My wife, my children—and my aged mother— Say, is she yet alive?” He is condemned To go ere set of sun, go whence he came, A banished man; and for a year to breathe The vapour of a dungeon. But his prayer (What could they less?) is granted. In a hall Open and crowded by the common herd, 'Twas there a Wife and her four sons yet young, A Mother borne along, life ebbing fast, And an old Doge, mustering his strength in vain, Assembled now, sad privilege, to meet One so long lost, one who for them had braved, For them had sought—death and yet worse than death! To meet him, and to part with him for ever!— Time and their wrongs had changed them all, him most! Yet when the Wife, the Mother looked again, 'Twas he—'twas he himself—'twas Giacomo! And all clung round him, weeping bitterly; Weeping the more, because they wept in vain. Unnerved, and now unsettled in his mind From long and exquisite pain, he sobs and cries, Kissing the old Man's cheek, “Help me, my Father! Let me, I pray thee, live once more among ye: Let me go home.”—“My Son,” returns the Doge, “Obey. Thy Country wills it.” Giacomo That night embarked; sent to an early grave For one whose dying words, “The deed was mine! He is most innocent! 'Twas I who did it!” Came when he slept in peace. The ship, that sailed Swift as the winds with his deliverance, Bore back a lifeless corse. Generous as brave, Affection, kindness, the sweet offices Of duty and love were from his tenderest years To him as needful as his daily bread; And to become a by-word in the streets, Bringing a stain on those who gave him life, And those, alas, now worse than fatherless— To be proclaimed a ruffian, a night-stabber, He on whom none before had breathed reproach— He lived but to disprove it. That hope lost, Death followed. Oh, if Justice be in Heaven, A day must come of ample Retribution! Then was thy cup, old Man, full to the brim. But thou wert yet alive; and there was one, The soul and spring of all that Enmity, Who would not leave thee; fastening on thy flank, Hungering and thirsting, still unsatisfied; One of a name illustrious as thine own! One of the Ten! one of the Invisible Three! 'Twas Loredano. When the whelps were gone, He would dislodge the Lion from his den; And, leading on the pack he long had led, The miserable pack that ever howled Against fallen Greatness, moved that Foscari Be Doge no longer; urging his great age; Calling the loneliness of Grief neglect Of duty, sullenness against the laws. —“I am most willing to retire,” said he: “But I have sworn, and cannot of myself. Do with me as ye please.”—He was deposed, He, who had reigned so long and gloriously; His ducal bonnet taken from his brow, His robes stript off, his seal and signet-ring Broken before him. But now nothing moved The meekness of his soul. All things alike! Among the six that came with the decree, Foscari saw one he knew not, and inquired His name. “I am the son of Marco Memmo.” “Ah,” he replied, “thy father was my friend.” And now he goes. “It is the hour and past. I have no business here.”—“But wilt thou not Avoid the gazing crowd? That way is private.” “No! as I entered, so will I retire.” And, leaning on his staff, he left the House, His residence for five-and-thirty years, By the same stairs up which he came in state; Those where the giants stand, guarding the ascent, Monstrous, terrific. At the foot he stopt, And, on his staff still leaning, turned and said, “By mine own merits did I come. I go, Driven by the malice of mine Enemies.” Then to his boat withdrew, poor as he came, Amid the sighs of them that dared not speak. This journey was his last. When the bell rang At dawn, announcing a new Doge to Venice, It found him on his knees before the Cross, Clasping his aged hands in earnest prayer; And there he died. Ere half its task was done, It rang his knell. But whence the deadly hate That caused all this—the hate of Loredano? It was a legacy his Father left, Who, but for Foscari, had reigned in Venice, And, like the venom in the serpent's bag, Gathered and grew! Nothing but turned to hate! In vain did Foscari supplicate for peace, Offering in marriage his fair Isabel. He changed not, with a dreadful piety Studying revenge; listening to those alone Who talked of vengeance; grasping by the hand Those in their zeal (and none were wanting there) Who came to tell him of another Wrong, Done or imagined. When his father died, They whispered, “'Twas by poison!” and the words Struck him as uttered from his father's grave. He wrote it on the tomb ('tis there in marble) And with a brow of care, most merchant-like, Among the debtors in his leger-book Entered at full (nor month, nor day forgot) “Francesco Foscari—for my Father's death.” Leaving a blank—to be filled up hereafter. When Foscari's noble heart at length gave way, He took the volume from the shelf again Calmly, and with his pen filled up the blank, Inscribing, “He has paid me.” Ye who sit Brooding from day to day, from day to day Chewing the bitter cud, and starting up As tho' the hour was come to whet your fangs, And, like the Pisan, gnaw the hairy scalp Of him who had offended—if ye must, Sit and brood on; but oh forbear to teach The lesson to your children. ARQUÀ. Three leagues from Padua stands and long has stood (The Paduan student knows it, honours it) A lonely tomb beside a mountain-church; And I arrived there as the sun declined Low in the west. The gentle airs, that breathe Fragrance at eve, were rising, and the birds Singing their farewell-song—the very song They sung the night that tomb received a tenant; When, as alive, clothed in his Canon's stole, And slowly winding down the narrow path, He came to rest there. Nobles of the land, Princes and prelates mingled in his train, Anxious by any act, while yet they could, To catch a ray of glory by reflection; And from that hour have kindred spirits flocked From distant countries, from the north, the south, To see where he is laid. Twelve years ago, When I descended the impetuous Rhone, Its vineyards of such great and old renown, Its castles, each with some romantic tale, Vanishing fast—the pilot at the stern, He who had steered so long, standing aloft, His eyes on the white breakers, and his hands On what was now his rudder, now his oar, A huge misshapen plank—the bark itself Frail and uncouth, launched to return no more, Such as a shipwrecked man might hope to build, Urged by the love of home—Twelve years ago, When like an arrow from the cord we flew, Two long, long days, silence, suspense on board, It was to offer at thy fount, Vaucluse, Entering the arched Cave, to wander where Petrarch had wandered, to explore and sit Where in his peasant-dress he loved to sit, Musing, reciting—on some rock moss-grown, Or the fantastic root of some old beech, That drinks the living waters as they stream Over their emerald-bed; and could I now Neglect the place where, in a graver mood, When he had done and settled with the world, When all the illusions of his Youth were fled, Indulged perhaps too much, cherished too long, He came for the conclusion? Half-way up He built his house, whence as by stealth he caught, Among the hills, a glimpse of busy life That soothed, not stirred.—But knock, and enter in. This was his chamber. 'Tis as when he went; As if he now were in his orchard-grove. And this his closet. Here he sat and read. This was his chair; and in it, unobserved, Reading, or thinking of his absent friends, He passed away as in a quiet slumber. Peace to this region! Peace to each, to all! They know his value—every coming step, That draws the gazing children from their play, Would tell them if they knew not.—But could aught, Ungentle or ungenerous, spring up Where he is sleeping; where, and in an age Of savage warfare and blind bigotry, He cultured all that could refine, exalt; Leading to better things? GINEVRA. If thou shouldst ever come by choice or chance To Modena, where still religiously Among her ancient trophies is preserved Bologna's bucket (in its chain it hangs Within that reverend tower, the Guirlandine) Stop at a Palace near the Reggio-gate, Dwelt in of old by one of the Orsini. Its noble gardens, terrace above terrace, And rich in fountains, statues, cypresses, Will long detain thee; thro' their arched walks, Dim at noon-day, discovering many a glimpse Of knights and dames, such as in old romance, And lovers, such as in heroic song, Perhaps the two, for groves were their delight, That in the spring-time, as alone they sate, Venturing together on a tale of love, Read only part that day.—A summer-sun Sets ere one half is seen; but, ere thou go, Enter the house—prythee, forget it not— And look awhile upon a picture there. 'Tis of a Lady in her earliest youth, The very last of that illustrious race, Done by Zampieri—but by whom I care not. He, who observes it—ere he passes on, Gazes his fill, and comes and comes again, That he may call it up, when far away. She sits, inclining forward as to speak, Her lips half-open, and her finger up, As though she said “Beware!” her vest of gold Broidered with flowers, and clasped from head to foot, An emerald-stone in every golden clasp; And on her brow, fairer than alabaster, A coronet of pearls. But then her face, So lovely, yet so arch, so full of mirth, The overflowings of an innocent heart— It haunts me still, though many a year has fled, Like some wild melody! Alone it hangs Over a mouldering heir-loom, its companion, An oaken-chest, half-eaten by the worm, But richly carved by Antony of Trent With scripture-stories from the Life of Christ; A chest that came from Venice, and had held The ducal robes of some old Ancestor. That by the way—it may be true or false— But don't forget the picture; and thou wilt not, When thou hast heard the tale they told me there. She was an only child; from infancy The joy, the pride of an indulgent Sire. Her Mother dying of the gift she gave, That precious gift, what else remained to him? The young Ginevra was his all in life, Still as she grew, for ever in his sight; And in her fifteenth year became a bride, Marrying an only son, Francesco Doria, Her playmate from her birth, and her first love. Just as she looks there in her bridal dress, She was all gentleness, all gaiety, Her pranks the favourite theme of every tongue. But now the day was come, the day, the hour; Now, frowning, smiling, for the hundredth time, The nurse, that ancient lady, preached decorum; And in the lustre of her youth, she gave Her hand, with her heart in it, to Francesco. Great was the joy; but at the Bridal feast, When all sate down, the Bride was wanting there. Nor was she to be found! Her Father cried, “'Tis but to make a trial of our love!” And filled his glass to all; but his hand shook, And soon from guest to guest the panic spread. 'Twas but that instant she had left Francesco, Laughing and looking back and flying still, Her ivory-tooth imprinted on his finger. But now, alas, she was not to be found; Nor from that hour could anything be guessed, But that she was not!—Weary of his life, Francesco flew to Venice, and forthwith Flung it away in battle with the Turk. Orsini lived; and long was to be seen An old man wandering as in quest of something, Something he could not find—he knew not what. When he was gone, the house remained awhile Silent and tenantless—then went to strangers. Full fifty years were past, and all forgot, When on an idle day, a day of search Mid the old lumber in the Gallery, That mouldering chest was noticed; and 'twas said By one as young, as thoughtless as Ginevra, “Why not remove it from its lurking place?” 'Twas done as soon as said; but on the way It burst, it fell; and lo, a skeleton, With here and there a pearl, an emerald-stone, A golden clasp, clasping a shred of gold. All else had perished—save a nuptial ring, And a small seal, her mother's legacy Engraven with a name, the name of both, “Ginevra.”—There then had she found a grave! Within that chest had she concealed herself, Fluttering with joy, the happiest of the happy; When a spring-lock, that lay in ambush there, Fastened her down for ever! BOLOGNA. 'Twas night; the noise and bustle of the day Were o'er. The mountebank no longer wrought Miraculous cures—he and his stage were gone; And he who, when the crisis of his tale Came, and all stood breathless with hope and fear, Sent round his cap; and he who thrummed his wire And sang, with pleading look and plaintive strain Melting the passenger. Thy thousand Cries, So well pourtrayed, and by a son of thine, Whose voice had swelled the hubbub in his youth, Were hushed, Bologna, silence in the streets, The squares, when hark, the clattering of fleet hoofs; And soon a Courier, posting as from far, Housing and holster, boot and belted coat And doublet, stained with many a various soil, Stopt and alighted. 'Twas where hangs aloft That ancient sign, the pilgrim, welcoming All who arrive there, all perhaps save those Clad like himself, with staff and scallop-shell, Those on a pilgrimage. And now approached Wheels, through the lofty porticoes resounding, Arch beyond arch, a shelter or a shade As the sky changes. To the gate they came; And, ere the man had half his story done, Mine host received the Master—one long used To sojourn among strangers, every where (Go where he would, along the wildest track) Flinging a charm that shall not soon be lost, And leaving footsteps to be traced by those Who love the haunts of Genius; one who saw, Observed, nor shunned the busy scenes of life, But mingled not, and mid the din, the stir, Lived as a separate Spirit. Much had passed Since last we parted; and those five short years— Much had they told! His clustering locks were turned Grey; nor did ought recall the Youth that swam From Sestos to Abydos. Yet his voice, Still it was sweet; still from his eye the thought Flashed lightning-like, nor lingered on the way, Waiting for words. Far, far into the night We sat, conversing—no unwelcome hour, The hour we met; and, when Aurora rose, Rising, we climbed the rugged Apennine. Well I remember how the golden sun Filled with its beams the unfathomable gulfs, As on we travelled, and along the ridge, Mid groves of cork and cistus and wild-fig, His motley household came—Not last nor least, Battista, who, upon the moonlight-sea Of Venice, had so ably, zealously, Served, and, at parting, thrown his oar away To follow through the world; who without stain Had worn so long that honourable badge, The gondolier's, in a Patrician House Arguing unlimited trust.—Not last nor least, Thou, tho' declining in thy beauty and strength, Faithful Moretto, to the latest hour Guarding his chamber-door, and now along The silent, sullen strand of Missolonghi Howling in grief.—He had just left that Place Of old renown, once in the Adrian sea, Ravenna! where, from Dante's sacred tomb He had so oft, as many a verse declares, Drawn inspiration; where, at twilight-time, Thro' the pine-forest wandering with loose rein, Wandering and lost, he had so oft beheld (What is not visible to a Poet's eye?) The spectre-knight, the hell-hounds and their prey, The chase, the slaughter, and the festal mirth Suddenly blasted. 'Twas a theme he loved, But others claimed their turn; and many a tower, Shattered, uprooted from its native rock, Its strength the pride of some heroic age, Appeared and vanished (many a sturdy steer Yoked and unyoked) while as in happier days He poured his spirit forth. The Past forgot, All was enjoyment. Not a cloud obscured Present or future. He is now at rest; And praise and blame fall on his ear alike, Now dull in death. Yes, Byron, thou art gone, Gone like a star that through the firmament Shot and was lost, in its eccentric course Dazzling, perplexing. Yet thy heart, methinks, Was generous, noble—noble in its scorn Of all things low or little; nothing there Sordid or servile. If imagined wrongs Pursued thee, urging thee sometimes to do Things long regretted, oft, as many know, None more than I, thy gratitude would build On slight foundations: and, if in thy life Not happy, in thy death thou surely wert, Thy wish accomplished; dying in the land Where thy young mind had caught ethereal fire, Dying in Greece, and in a cause so glorious! They in thy train—ah, little did they think, As round we went, that they so soon should sit Mourning beside thee, while a Nation mourned, Changing her festal for her funeral song; That they so soon should hear the minute-gun, As morning gleamed on what remained of thee, Roll o'er the sea, the mountains, numbering Thy years of joy and sorrow. Thou art gone; And he who would assail thee in thy grave, Oh, let him pause! For who among us all, Tried as thou wert—even from thine earliest years, When wandering, yet unspoilt, a highland-boy— Tried as thou wert, and with thy soul of flame; Pleasure, while yet the down was on thy cheek, Uplifting, pressing, and to lips like thine, Her charmed cup—ah, who among us all Could say he had not erred as much, and more? FLORENCE. Of all the fairest Cities of the Earth None is so fair as Florence. 'Tis a gem Of purest ray; and what a light broke forth, When it emerged from darkness! Search within, Without; all is enchantment! 'Tis the Past Contending with the Present; and in turn Each has the mastery. In this chapel wrought One of the Few, Nature's Interpreters, The Few, whom Genius gives as Lights to shine, Masaccio; and he slumbers underneath. Wouldst thou behold his monument? Look round! And know that where we stand, stood oft and long, Oft till the day was gone, Raphael himself; Nor he alone, so great the ardour there, Such, while it reigned, the generous rivalry; He and how many as at once called forth, Anxious to learn of those who came before, To steal a spark from their authentic fire, Theirs who first broke the universal gloom, Sons of the Morning. On that ancient seat, The seat of stone that runs along the wall, South of the Church, east of the belfry-tower, (Thou canst not miss it) in the sultry time Would Dante sit conversing, and with those Who little thought that in his hand he held The balance, and assigned at his good pleasure To each his place in the invisible world, To some an upper region, some a lower; Many a transgressor sent to his account, Long ere in Florence numbered with the dead; The body still as full of life and stir At home, abroad; still and as oft inclined To eat, drink, sleep; still clad as others were, And at noon-day, where men were wont to meet, Met as continually; when the soul went, Relinquished to a demon, and by him (So says the Bard, and who can read and doubt?) Dwelt in and governed. Sit thee down awhile; Then, by the gates so marvellously wrought, That they might serve to be the gates of Heaven, Enter the Baptistery. That place he loved, Loved as his own; and in his visits there Well might he take delight! For when a child, Playing, as many are wont, with venturous feet Near and yet nearer to the sacred font, Slipped and fell in, he flew and rescued him, Flew with an energy, a violence, That broke the marble—a mishap ascribed To evil motives; his, alas, to lead A life of trouble, and ere long to leave All things most dear to him, ere long to know How salt another's bread is, and the toil Of going up and down another's stairs. Nor then forget that Chamber of the Dead, Where the gigantic shapes of Night and Day, Turned into stone, rest everlastingly; Yet still are breathing, and shed round at noon A two-fold influence—only to be felt— A light, a darkness, mingling each with each; Both and yet neither. There, from age to age, Two Ghosts are sitting on their sepulchres. That is the Duke Lorenzo. Mark him well. He meditates, his head upon his hand. What from beneath his helm-like bonnet scowls? Is it a face, or but an eyeless skull? 'Tis lost in shade; yet, like the basilisk, It fascinates, and is intolerable. His mien is noble, most majestical! Then most so, when the distant choir is heard At morn or eve—nor fail thou to attend On that thrice-hallowed day, when all are there; When all, propitiating with solemn songs, Visit the Dead. Then wilt thou feel his Power! But let not Sculpture, Painting, Poesy, Or They, the Masters of these mighty Spells, Detain us. Our first homage is to Virtue. Where, in what dungeon of the Citadel, (It must be known—the writing on the wall Cannot be gone—'twas with the blade cut in, Ere, on his knees to God, he slew himself,) Did He, the last, the noblest Citizen, Breathe out his soul, lest in the torturing hour He might accuse the Guiltless? That debt paid, But with a sigh, a tear for human frailty, We may return, and once more give a loose To the delighted spirit—worshipping, In her small temple of rich workmanship, Venus herself, who, when she left the skies, Came hither. DON GARZÌA. Among those awful forms, in elder time Assembled, and through many an after-age Destined to stand as Genii of the Place Where men most meet in Florence, may be seen His who first played the Tyrant. Clad in mail, But with his helmet off—in kingly state, Aloft he sits upon his horse of brass; And they, that read the legend underneath, Go and pronounce him happy. Yet, methinks, There is a Chamber that, if walls could speak, Would turn their admiration into pity. Half of what passed, died with him; but the rest, All he discovered when the fit was on, All that, by those who listened, could be gleaned From broken sentences and starts in sleep, Is told, and by an honest Chronicler. Two of his sons, Giovanni and Garzìa, (The eldest had not seen his nineteenth summer) Went to the chase; but only one returned. Giovanni, when the huntsman blew his horn O'er the last stag that started from the brake, And in the heather turned to stand at bay, Appeared not; and at close of day was found Bathed in his innocent blood. Too well, alas, The trembling Cosmo guessed the deed, the doer; And, having caused the body to be borne In secret to that Chamber—at an hour When all slept sound, save she who bore them both, Who little thought of what was yet to come, And lived but to be told—he bade Garzìa Arise and follow him. Holding in one hand A winking lamp, and in the other a key Massive and dungeon-like, thither he led; And, having entered in and locked the door, The father fixed his eyes upon the son, And closely questioned him. No change betrayed Or guilt or fear. Then Cosmo lifted up The bloody sheet. “Look there! Look there!” he cried. “Blood calls for blood—and from a father's hand! —Unless thyself wilt save him that sad office. What!” he exclaimed, when, shuddering at the sight, The boy breathed out, “I stood but on my guard.” “Dar'st thou then blacken one who never wronged thee, Who would not set his foot upon a worm? Yes, thou must die, lest others fall by thee, And thou shouldst be the slayer of us all. Then from Garzìa's belt he drew the blade, That fatal one which spilt his brother's blood; And, kneeling on the ground, “Great God!” he cried, “Grant me the strength to do an act of Justice. Thou knowest what it costs me; but, alas, How can I spare myself, sparing none else? Grant me the strength, the will—and oh forgive The sinful soul of a most wretched son. 'Tis a most wretched father who implores it.” Long on Garzìa's neck he hung and wept, Long pressed him to his bosom tenderly; And then, but while he held him by the arm, Thrusting him backward, turned away his face, And stabbed him to the heart. Well might a Youth, Studious of men, anxious to learn and know, When in the train of some great embassy He came, a visitant, to Cosmo's court, Think on the past; and, as he wandered through The ample spaces of an ancient house, Silent, deserted—stop awhile to dwell Upon two portraits there, drawn on the wall Together, as of Two in bonds of love, Those of the unhappy brothers, and conclude From the sad looks of him who could have told, The terrible truth.—Well might he heave a sigh For poor humanity, when he beheld That very Cosmo shaking o'er his fire, Drowsy and deaf and inarticulate, Wrapt in his night-gown, o'er a sick man's mess, In the last stage—death-struck and deadly pale; His wife, another, not his Eleanor, At once his nurse and his interpreter. THE CAMPAGNA OF FLORENCE. 'Tis morning. Let us wander through the fields, Where Cimabuè found a shepherd-boy Tracing his idle fancies on the ground; And let us from the top of Fiesole, Whence Galileo's glass by night observed The phases of the moon, look round below On Arno's vale, where the dove-coloured steer Is ploughing up and down among the vines, While many a careless note is sung aloud, Filling the air with sweetness—and on thee, Beautiful Florence, all within thy walls, Thy groves and gardens, pinnacles and towers, Drawn to our feet. From that small spire, just caught By the bright ray, that church among the rest By One of Old distinguished as The Bride, Let us in thought pursue (what can we better?) Those who assembled there at matin-time; Who, when Vice revelled and along the street Tables were set, what time the bearer's bell Rang to demand the dead at every door, Came out into the meadows; and, awhile Wandering in idleness, but not in folly, Sate down in the high grass and in the shade Of many a tree sun-proof—day after day, When all was still and nothing to be heard But the cicala's voice among the olives, Relating in a ring, to banish care, Their hundred tales. Round the green hill they went, Round underneath—first to a splendid house, Gherardi, as an old tradition runs, That on the left, just rising from the vale; A place for Luxury—the painted rooms, The open galleries and middle court Not unprepared, fragrant and gay with flowers. Then westward to another, nobler yet; That on the right, now known as the Palmieri, Where Art with Nature vied—a Paradise With verdurous walls, and many a trellissed walk All rose and jasmine, many a twilight-glade Crossed by the deer. Then to the Ladies' Vale; And the clear lake, that as by magic seemed To lift up to the surface every stone Of lustre there, and the diminutive fish Innumerable, dropt with crimson and gold, Now motionless, now glancing to the sun. Who has not dwelt on their voluptuous day? The morning-banquet by the fountain-side, While the small birds rejoiced on every bough; The dance that followed, and the noon-tide slumber; Then the tales told in turn, as round they lay On carpets, the fresh waters murmuring; And the short interval of pleasant talk Till supper-time, when many a siren-voice Sung down the stars; and, as they left the sky, The torches, planted in the sparkling grass, And every where among the glowing flowers, Burnt bright and brighter.—He, whose dream it was, (It was no more) sleeps in a neighbouring vale; Sleeps in the church, where, in his ear, I ween, The Friar poured out his wondrous catalogue; A ray, imprimis, of the star that shone To the Wise Men; a vial-ful of sounds, The musical chimes of the great bells that hung In Solomon's Temple; and, though last not least, A feather from the Angel Gabriel's wing, Dropt in the Virgin's chamber. That dark ridge, Stretching south-east, conceals it from our sight; Not so his lowly roof and scanty farm, His copse and rill, if yet a trace be left, Who lived in Val di Pesa, suffering long Want and neglect and (far, far worse) reproach, With calm, unclouded mind. The glimmering tower On the grey rock beneath, his land-mark once, Now serves for ours, and points out where he ate His bread with cheerfulness. Who sees him not ('Tis his own sketch—he drew it from himself) Laden with cages from his shoulder slung, And sallying forth, while yet the morn is grey, To catch a thrush on every lime-twig there; Or in the wood among his wood-cutters; Or in the tavern by the highway-side At tric-trac with the miller; or at night, Doffing his rustic suit, and, duly clad, Entering his closet, and, among his books, Among the Great of every age and clime, A numerous court, turning to whom he pleased, Questioning each why he did this or that, And learning how to overcome the fear Of poverty and death? Nearer we hail Thy sunny slope, Arcetri, sung of Old For its green wine; dearer to me, to most, As dwelt on by that great Astronomer, Seven years a prisoner at the city-gate, Let in but in his grave-clothes. Sacred be His villa (justly was it called The Gem!) Sacred the lawn, where many a cypress threw Its length of shadow, while he watched the stars! Sacred the vineyard, where, while yet his sight Glimmered, at blush of morn he dressed his vines, Chanting aloud in gaiety of heart Some verse of Ariosto!—There, unseen, In manly beauty Milton stood before him, Gazing with reverent awe—Milton, his guest, Just then come forth, all life and enterprise; He in his old age and extremity, Blind, at noon-day exploring with his staff; His eyes upturned as to the golden sun, His eye-balls idly rolling. Little then Did Galileo think whom he received; That in his hand he held the hand of one Who could requite him—who would spread his name O'er lands and seas—great as himself, nay greater; Milton as little that in him he saw, As in a glass, what he himself should be, Destined so soon to fall on evil days And evil tongues—so soon, alas, to live In darkness, and with dangers compassed round, And solitude. Well-pleased, could we pursue The Arno, from his birth-place in the clouds, So near the yellow Tiber's—springing up From his four fountains on the Apennine, That mountain-ridge a sea-mark to the ships Sailing on either sea. Downward he runs, Scattering fresh verdure through the desolate wild, Down by the City of Hermits, and the woods That only echo to the choral hymn; Then through these gardens to the Tuscan sea, Reflecting castles, convents, villages, And those great Rivals in an elder day, Florence and Pisa—who have given him fame, Fame everlasting, but who stained so oft His troubled waters. Oft, alas, were seen, When flight, pursuit, and hideous rout were there, Hands, clad in gloves of steel, held up imploring; The man, the hero, on his foaming steed Borne underneath, already in the realms Of Darkness.—Nor did night or burning noon Bring respite. Oft, as that great Artist saw, Whose pencil had a voice, the cry “To arms!” And the shrill trumpet hurried up the bank Those who had stolen an hour to breast the tide, And wash from their unharnessed limbs the blood And sweat of battle. Sudden was the rush, Violent the tumult; for, already in sight, Nearer and nearer yet the danger drew; Each every sinew straining, every nerve, Each snatching up, and girding, buckling on Morion and greave and shirt of twisted mail, As for his life—no more perchance to taste, Arno, the grateful freshness of thy glades, Thy waters—where, exulting, he had felt A swimmer's transport, there, alas, to float And welter.—Nor between the gusts of War, When flocks were feeding, and the shepherd's pipe Gladdened the valley, when, but not unarmed, The sower came forth, and following him that ploughed, Threw in the seed—did thy indignant waves Escape pollution. Sullen was the splash, Heavy and swift the plunge, when they received The key that just had grated on the ear Of Ugolino, ever-closing up That dismal dungeon thenceforth to be named The Tower of Famine.—Once indeed 'twas thine, When many a winter-flood, thy tributary, Was through its rocky glen rushing, resounding, And thou wert in thy might, to save, restore A charge most precious. To the nearest ford, Hastening, a horseman from Arezzo came, Careless, impatient of delay, a babe Slung in a basket to the knotty staff That lay athwart his saddle-bow. He spurs, He enters; and his horse, alarmed, perplexed, Halts in the midst. Great is the stir, the strife; And lo, an atom on that dangerous sea, The babe is floating! Fast and far he flies; Now tempest-rocked, now whirling round and round, But not to perish. By thy willing waves Borne to the shore, among the bulrushes The ark has rested; and unhurt, secure, As on his mother's breast he sleeps within, All peace! or never had the nations heard That voice so sweet, which still enchants, inspires; That voice, which sung of love, of liberty. Petrarch lay there!—And such the images That here spring up for ever, in the Young Kindling poetic fire! Such they that came And clustered round our Milton, when at eve, Reclined beside thee, Arno; when at eve, Led on by thee, he wandered with delight, Framing Ovidian verse, and through thy groves Gathering wild myrtle. Such the Poet's dreams; Yet not such only. For look round and say, Where is the ground that did not drink warm blood, The echo that had learnt not to articulate The cry of murder?—Fatal was the day To Florence, when ('twas in a narrow street North of that temple, where the truly great Sleep, not unhonoured, not unvisited; That temple sacred to the Holy Cross— There is the house—that house of the Donati, Towerless, and left long since, but to the last Braving assault—all rugged, all embossed Below, and still distinguished by the rings Of brass, that held in war and festival-time Their family-standards) fatal was the day To Florence, when, at morn, at the ninth hour, A noble Dame in weeds of widowhood, Weeds by so many to be worn so soon, Stood at her door; and, like a sorceress, flung Her dazzling spell. Subtle she was, and rich, Rich in a hidden pearl of heavenly light, Her daughter's beauty; and too well she knew Its virtue! Patiently she stood and watched; Nor stood alone—but spoke not—In her breast Her purpose lay; and, as a Youth passed by, Clad for the nuptial rite, she smiled and said, Lifting a corner of the maiden's veil, “This had I treasured up in secret for thee. This hast thou lost!” He gazed and was undone! Forgetting—not forgot—he broke the bond, And paid the penalty, losing his life At the bridge-foot; and hence a world of woe! Vengeance for vengeance crying, blood for blood; No intermission! Law, that slumbers not, And, like the Angel with the flaming sword, Sits over all, at once chastising, healing, Himself the Avenger, went; and every street Ran red with mutual slaughter—though sometimes The young forgot the lesson they had learnt, And loved when they should hate—like thee, Imelda, Thee and thy Paolo. When last ye met In that still hour (the heat, the glare was gone, Not so the splendour—through the cedar-grove A radiance streamed like a consuming fire, As though the glorious orb, in its descent, Had come and rested there) when last ye met, And thy relentless brothers dragged him forth, It had been well, hadst thou slept on, Imelda, Nor from thy trance of fear awaked, as night Fell on that fatal spot, to wish thee dead, To track him by his blood, to search, to find, Then fling thee down to catch a word, a look, A sigh, if yet thou couldst (alas, thou couldst not) And die, unseen, unthought of—from the wound Sucking the poison. Yet, when Slavery came, Worse followed. Genius, Valour left the land, Indignant—all that had from age to age Adorned, ennobled; and head-long they fell, Tyrant and slave. For deeds of violence, Done in broad day and more than half redeemed By many a great and generous sacrifice Of self to others, came the unpledged bowl, The stab of the stiletto. Gliding by Unnoticed, in slouched hat and muffling cloak, That just discovered, Caravaggio-like, A swarthy cheek, black brow, and eye of flame, The Bravo stole, and o'er the shoulder plunged To the heart's core, or from beneath the ribs Slanting (a surer path, as some averred) Struck upward—then slunk off, or, if pursued, Made for the Sanctuary, and there along The glimmering aisle among the worshippers Wandered with restless step and jealous look, Dropping thick blood.—Misnamed to lull alarm, In every Palace was The Laboratory, Where he within brewed poisons swift and slow, That scattered terror 'till all things seemed poisonous, And brave men trembled if a hand held out A nosegay or a letter; while the Great Drank only from the Venice-glass, that broke, That shivered, scattering round it as in scorn, If aught malignant, aught of thine was there, Cruel Tophana; and pawned provinces For that miraculous gem, the gem that gave A sign infallible of coming ill, That clouded though the vehicle of death Were an invisible perfume. Happy then The guest to whom at sleeping-time 'twas said, But in an under-voice (a lady's page Speaks in no louder) “Pass not on. That door Leads to another which awaits thy coming, One in the floor—now left, alas, unlocked. No eye detects it—lying under-foot, Just as thou enterest, at the threshold-stone; Ready to fall and plunge thee into night And long oblivion!”—In that Evil Hour Where lurked not danger? Through the fairy-land No seat of pleasure glittering half-way down, No hunting-place—but with some damning spot That will not be washed out! There, at Caïano, Where, when the hawks were mewed and Evening came, Pulci would set the table in a roar With his wild lay—there, where the Sun descends, And hill and dale are lost, veiled with his beams, The fair Venetian died, she and her lord— Died of a posset drugged by him who sat And saw them suffer, flinging back the charge; The murderer on the murdered.—Sobs of Grief, Sounds inarticulate — suddenly stopt, And followed by a struggle and a gasp, A gasp in death, are heard yet in Cerreto, Along the marble halls and stair-cases, Nightly at twelve; and, at the self-same hour, Shrieks, such as penetrate the inmost soul, Such as awake the innocent babe to long, Long wailing, echo through the emptiness Of that old den far up among the hills, Frowning on him who comes from Pietra-Mala: In them, alas, within five days and less, Two unsuspecting victims, passing fair, Welcomed with kisses, and slain cruelly, One with the knife, one with the fatal noose. But lo, the Sun is setting; earth and sky One blaze of glory—What we saw but now, As though it were not, though it had not been! He lingers yet; and, lessening to a point, Shines like the eye of Heaven—then withdraws; And from the zenith to the utmost skirts All is celestial red! The hour is come, When they that sail along the distant seas, Languish for home; and they that in the morn Said to sweet friends “farewell,” melt as at parting; When, just gone forth, the pilgrim, if he hears, As now we hear it—wandering round the hill, The bell that seems to mourn the dying day, Slackens his pace and sighs, and those he loved Loves more than ever. But who feels it not? And well may we, for we are far away. THE PILGRIM. It was an hour of universal joy. The lark was up and at the gate of heaven, Singing, as sure to enter when he came; The butterfly was basking in my path, His radiant wings unfolded. From below The bell of prayer rose slowly, plaintively; And odours, such as welcome in the day, Such as salute the early traveller, And come and go, each sweeter than the last, Were rising. Hill and valley breathed delight; And not a living thing but blessed the hour! In every bush and brake there was a voice Responsive! From the Thrasymene, that now Slept in the sun, a lake of molten gold, And from the shore that once, when armies met, Rocked to and fro unfelt, so terrible The rage, the slaughter, I had turned away; The path, that led me, leading through a wood, A fairy-wilderness of fruits and flowers, And by a brook that, in the day of strife, Ran blood, but now runs amber—when a glade, Far, far within, sunned only at noon-day, Suddenly opened. Many a bench was there, Each round its ancient elm; and many a track, Well-known to them that from the high-way loved Awhile to deviate. In the midst a cross Of mouldering stone as in a temple stood, Solemn, severe; coeval with the trees That round it in majestic order rose; And on the lowest step a Pilgrim knelt In fervent prayer. He was the first I saw, (Save in the tumult of a midnight-masque, A revel, where none cares to play his part, And they, that speak, at once dissolve the charm) The first in sober truth, no counterfeit; And, when his orisons were duly paid, He rose, and we exchanged, as all are wont, A traveller's greeting. Young, and of an age When Youth is most attractive, when a light Plays round and round, reflected, while it lasts, From some attendant Spirit, that ere long (His charge relinquished with a sigh, a tear) Wings his flight upward—with a look he won My favour; and, the spell of silence broke, I could not but continue.—“Whence,” I asked, “Whence art thou?”—“From Mont' alto,” he replied, “My native village in the Apennines.”— “And whither journeying?”—“To the holy shrine Of Saint Antonio in the City of Padua. Perhaps, if thou hast ever gone so far, Thou wilt direct my course.”—“Most willingly; But thou hast much to do, much to endure, Ere thou hast entered where the silver lamps Burn ever. Tell me ... I would not transgress, Yet ask I must ... what could have brought thee forth, Nothing in act or thought to be atoned for?”— “It was a vow I made in my distress. We were so blest, none were so blest as we, Till Sickness came. First, as death-struck, I fell; Then my beloved Sister; and ere long, Worn with continual watchings, night and day, Our saint-like mother. Worse and worse she grew; And in my anguish, my despair, I vowed, That if she lived, if Heaven restored her to us, I would forthwith, and in a Pilgrim's weeds, Visit that holy shrine. My vow was heard; And therefore am I come.”—“Blest be thy steps; And may those weeds, so reverenced of old, Guard thee in danger!”—“They are nothing worth. But they are worn in humble confidence; Nor would I for the richest robe resign them, Wrought, as they were, by those I love so well, Lauretta and my sister; theirs the task, But none to them, a pleasure, a delight, To ply their utmost skill, and send me forth As best became this service. Their last words, ‘Fare thee well, Carlo. We shall count the hours!’ Will not go from me.”—“Health and strength be thine In thy long travel! May no sun-beam strike; No vapour cling and wither! May'st thou be, Sleeping or waking, sacred and secure; And, when again thou com'st, thy labour done, Joy be among ye! In that happy hour All will pour forth to bid thee welcome, Carlo; And there is one, or I am much deceived, One thou hast named, who will not be the last.”— “Oh, she is true as Truth itself can be! But ah, thou know'st her not. Would that thou couldst! My steps I quicken when I think of her; For, though they take me further from her door, I shall return the sooner.” AN INTERVIEW. Pleasure, that comes unlooked-for, is thrice welcome; And, if it stir the heart, if aught be there, That may hereafter in a thoughtful hour Wake but a sigh, 'tis treasured up among The things most precious! and the day it came Is noted as a white day in our lives. The sun was wheeling westward, and the cliffs And nodding woods, that everlastingly (Such the dominion of thy mighty voice, Thy voice, Velino, uttered in the mist) Hear thee and answer thee, were left at length For others still as noon; and on we strayed From wild to wilder, nothing hospitable Seen up or down, no bush or green or dry, That ancient symbol at the cottage-door, Offering refreshment—when Luigi cried, “Well, of a thousand tracks we chose the best!” And, turning round an oak, oracular once, Now lightning-struck, a cave, a thorough-fare For all that came, each entrance a broad arch, Whence many a deer, rustling his velvet coat, Had issued, many a gipsy and her brood Peered forth, then housed again—the floor yet grey With ashes, and the sides, where roughest, hung Loosely with locks of hair—I looked and saw What, seen in such an hour by Sancho Panza, Had given his honest countenance a breadth, His cheeks a flush of pleasure and surprise Unknown before, had chained him to the spot, And thou, Sir Knight, hadst traversed hill and dale, Squire-less.—Below and winding far away, A narrow glade unfolded, such as Spring Broiders with flowers, and, when the moon is high, The hare delights to race in, scattering round The silvery dews. Cedar and cypress threw Singly their depth of shadow, chequering The greensward, and, what grew in frequent tufts, An underwood of myrtle, that by fits Sent up a gale of fragrance. Through the midst, Reflecting, as it ran, purple and gold, A rain-bow's splendour (somewhere in the east Rain-drops were falling fast) a rivulet Sported as loth to go; and on the bank Stood (in the eyes of one, if not of both, Worth all the rest and more) a sumpter-mule Well-laden, while two menials as in haste Drew from his ample panniers, ranging round Viands and fruits on many a shining salver, And plunging in the cool translucent wave Flasks of delicious wine.—Anon a horn Blew, through the champain bidding to the feast, Its jocund note to other ears addressed, Not ours; and, slowly coming by a path, That, ere it issued from an ilex-grove, Was seen far inward, though along the glade Distinguished only by a fresher verdure, Peasants approached, one leading in a leash Beagles yet panting, one with various game In rich confusion slung, before, behind, Leveret and quail and pheasant. All announced The chase as over; and ere long appeared, Their horses full of fire, champing the curb, For the white foam was dry upon the flank, Two in close converse, each in each delighting, Their plumage waving as instinct with life; A Lady young and graceful, and a Youth, Yet younger, bearing on a falconer's glove, As in the golden, the romantic time, His falcon hooded. Like some spirit of air, Or fairy-vision, such as feigned of old, The Lady, while her courser pawed the ground, Alighted; and her beauty, as she trod The enamelled bank, bruising nor herb nor flower, That place illumined. Ah, who should she be, And with her brother, as when last we met, (When the first lark had sung ere half was said, And as she stood, bidding adieu, her voice, So sweet it was, recalled me like a spell) Who but Angelica?—That day we gave To pleasure, and, unconscious of their flight, Another and another! hers a home Dropt from the sky amid the wild and rude, Loretto-like; where all was as a dream, A dream spun out of some Arabian tale Read or related in a jasmine bower, Some balmy eve. The rising moon we hailed, Duly, devoutly, from a vestibule Of many an arch, o'erwrought and lavishly With many a labyrinth of sylphs and flowers, When Raphael and his school from Florence came, Filling the land with splendour—nor less oft Watched her, declining, from a silent dell, Not silent once, what time in rivalry Tasso, Guarini, waved their wizard-wands, Peopling the groves from Arcady, and lo, Fair forms appeared, murmuring melodious verse, —Then, in their day, a sylvan theatre, Mossy the seats, the stage a verdurous floor, The scenery rock and shrub-wood, Nature's own; Nature the Architect. ROME. I am in Rome! Oft as the morning-ray Visits these eyes, waking at once I cry, Whence this excess of joy? What has befallen me? And from within a thrilling voice replies, Thou art in Rome! A thousand busy thoughts Rush on my mind, a thousand images; And I spring up as girt to run a race! Thou art in Rome! the City that so long Reigned absolute, the mistress of the world; The mighty vision that the prophets saw, And trembled; that from nothing, from the least, The lowliest village (What but here and there A reed-roofed cabin by the river side?) Grew into every thing; and, year by year, Patiently, fearlessly, working her way O'er brook and field, o'er continent and sea, Not like the merchant with his merchandize, Or traveller with staff and scrip exploring, But ever hand to hand and foot to foot, Through nations numberless in battle-array, Each behind each, each, when the other fell, Up and in arms, at length subdued them All. Thou art in Rome! the City, where the Gauls, Entering at sun-rise through her open gates, And, through her streets silent and desolate, Marching to slay, thought they saw Gods, not men; The City, that, by temperance, fortitude, And love of glory, towered above the clouds, Then fell—but, falling, kept the highest seat, And in her loneliness, her pomp of woe, Where now she dwells, withdrawn into the wild, Still o'er the mind maintains, from age to age, Her empire undiminished.—There, as though Grandeur attracted Grandeur, are beheld All things that strike, ennoble—from the depths Of Egypt, from the classic fields of Greece, Her groves, her temples—all things that inspire Wonder, delight! Who would not say the Forms Most perfect, most divine, had by consent Flocked thither to abide eternally, Within those silent chambers where they dwell, In happy intercourse?—And I am there! Ah, little thought I, when in school I sate, A school-boy on his bench, at early dawn Glowing with Roman story, I should live To tread the Appian, once an avenue Of monuments most glorious, palaces, Their doors sealed up and silent as the night, The dwellings of the illustrious dead—to turn Toward Tibur, and, beyond the City-gate, Pour out my unpremeditated verse Where on his mule I might have met so oft Horace himself—or climb the Palatine, Dreaming of old Evander and his guest, Dreaming and lost on that proud eminence, Long while the seat of Rome, hereafter found Less than enough (so monstrous was the brood Engendered there, so Titan-like) to lodge One in his madness; and inscribe my name, My name and date, on some broad aloe-leaf, That shoots and spreads within those very walls Where Virgil read aloud his tale divine, Where his voice faltered and a mother wept Tears of delight! But what the narrow space Just underneath? In many a heap the ground Heaves, as if Ruin in a frantic mood Had done his utmost. Here and there appears, As left to show his handy-work not ours, An idle column, a half-buried arch, A wall of some great temple.—It was once, And long, the centre of their Universe, The Forum—whence a mandate, eagle-winged, Went to the ends of the earth. Let us descend Slowly. At every step much may be lost. The very dust we tread, stirs as with life: And not a breath but from the ground sends up Something of human grandeur. We are come, Are now where once the mightiest spirits met In terrible conflict; this, while Rome was free, The noblest theatre on this side Heaven! —Here the first Brutus stood, when o'er the corse Of her so chaste all mourned, and from his cloud Burst like a God. Here, holding up the knife That ran with blood, the blood of his own child, Virginius called down vengeance.—But whence spoke They who harangued the people; turning now To the twelve tables, now with lifted hands To the Capitoline Jove, whose fulgent shape In the unclouded azure shone far off, And to the shepherd on the Alban mount Seemed like a star new-risen? Where were ranged In rough array as on their element, The beaks of those old galleys, destined still To brave the brunt of war—at last to know A calm far worse, a silence as in death? All spiritless; from that disastrous hour When he, the bravest, gentlest of them all, Scorning the chains he could not hope to break, Fell on his sword! Along the Sacred Way Hither the triumph came, and, winding round With acclamation, and the martial clang Of instruments, and cars laden with spoil, Stopped at the sacred stair that then appeared, Then thro' the darkness broke, ample, star-bright, As tho' it led to heaven. 'Twas night; but now A thousand torches, turning night to day, Blazed, and the victor, springing from his seat, Went up and, kneeling as in fervent prayer, Entered the Capitol. But what are they Who at the foot withdraw, a mournful train In fetters? And who, yet incredulous, Now gazing wildly round, now on his sons, On those so young, well-pleased with all they see, Staggers along, the last?—They are the fallen, Those who were spared to grace the chariot-wheels; And there they parted, where the road divides, The victor and the vanquished—there withdrew; He to the festal board, and they to die. Well might the great, the mighty of the world, They who were wont to fare deliciously And war but for a kingdom more or less, Shrink back nor from their thrones endure to look, To think that way! Well might they in their pomp Humble themselves, and kneel and supplicate To be delivered from a dream like this! Here Cincinnatus passed, his plough the while Left in the furrow; and how many more, Whose laurels fade not, who still walk the earth, Consuls, Dictators, still in Curule state Sit and decide; and, as of old in Rome, Name but their names, set every heart on fire! Here, in his bonds, he whom the phalanx saved not, The last on Philip's throne; and the Numidian, So soon to say, stript of his cumbrous robe, Stript to the skin, and in his nakedness Thrust under-ground, “How cold this bath of yours!” And thy proud queen, Palmyra, thro' the sands Pursued, o'ertaken on her dromedary; Whose temples, palaces, a wondrous dream That passes not away, for many a league Illumine yet the desert. Some invoked Death and escaped; the Egyptian, when her asp Came from his covert under the green leaf; And Hannibal himself; and she who said, Taking the fatal cup between her hands, “Tell him I would it had come yesterday; For then it had not been his nuptial gift.” Now all is changed; and here, as in the wild, The day is silent, dreary as the night; None stirring, save the herdsman and his herd, Savage alike; or they that would explore, Discuss and learnedly; or they that come, (And there are many who have crossed the earth) That they may give the hours to meditation, And wander, often saying to themselves, “This was the Roman Forum!” A FUNERAL. Whence this delay?”—“Along the crowded street A Funeral comes, and with unusual pomp.” So I withdrew a little and stood still, While it went by. “She died as she deserved,” Said an Abate, gathering up his cloak, And with a shrug retreating as the tide Flowed more and more.—“But she was beautiful!” Replied a soldier of the Pontiff's guard. “And innocent as beautiful!” exclaimed A Matron sitting in her stall, hung round With garlands, holy pictures, and what not? Her Alban grapes and Tusculan figs displayed In rich profusion. From her heart she spoke; And I accosted her to hear her story. “The stab,” she cried, “was given in jealousy; But never fled a purer spirit to heaven, As thou wilt say, or much my mind misleads, When thou hast seen her face. Last night at dusk, When on her way from vespers—None were near, None save her serving-boy who knelt and wept, But what could tears avail him, when she fell— Last night at dusk, the clock then striking nine, Just by the fountain—that before the church, The church she always used, St. Isidore's— Alas, I knew her from her earliest youth, That excellent lady. Ever would she say, Good even, as she passed, and with a voice Gentle as theirs in heaven!”—But now by fits A dull and dismal noise assailed the ear, A wail, a chant, louder and louder yet; And now a strange fantastic troop appeared! Thronging, they came—as from the shades below; All of a ghostly white! “O say,” I cried, “Do not the living here bury the dead? Do Spirits come and fetch them? What are these, That seem not of this World, and mock the Day; Each with a burning taper in his hand?”— “It is an ancient Brotherhood thou seest. Such their apparel. Through the long, long line, Look where thou wilt, no likeness of a man; The living masked, the dead alone uncovered. But mark”—And, lying on her funeral-couch, Like one asleep, her eyelids closed, her hands Folded together on her modest breast, As 't were her nightly posture, through the crowd She came at last—and richly, gaily clad, As for a birth-day feast! But breathes she not? A glow is on her cheek—and her lips move! And now a smile is there—how heavenly sweet! “Oh no!” replied the Dame, wiping her tears, But with an accent less of grief than anger, “No, she will never, never wake again!” Death, when we meet the Spectre in our walks, As we did yesterday and shall to-morrow, Soon grows familiar—like most other things, Seen, not observed; but in a foreign clime, Changing his shape to something new and strange, (And through the world he changes as in sport, Affect he greatness or humility) Knocks at the heart. His form and fashion here To me, I do confess, reflect a gloom, A sadness round; yet one I would not lose; Being in unison with all things else In this, this land of shadows, where we live More in past time than present, where the ground, League beyond league, like one great cemetery, Is covered o'er with mouldering monuments; And, let the living wander where they will, They cannot leave the footsteps of the dead. Oft, where the burial-rite follows so fast The agony, oft coming, nor from far, Must a fond father meet his darling child, (Him who at parting climbed his knees and clung) Clay-cold and wan, and to the bearers cry, “Stand, I conjure ye!” Seen thus destitute, What are the greatest? They must speak beyond A thousand homilies. When Raphael went, His heavenly face the mirror of his mind, His mind a temple for all lovely things To flock to and inhabit—when He went, Wrapt in his sable cloak, the cloak he wore, To sleep beneath the venerable Dome, By those attended, who in life had loved, Had worshipped, following in his steps to Fame, ('Twas on an April-day, when Nature smiles) All Rome was there. But, ere the march began, Ere to receive their charge the bearers came, Who had not sought him? And when all beheld Him, where he lay, how changed from yesterday, Him in that hour cut off, and at his head His last great work; when, entering in, they looked Now on the dead, then on that master-piece, Now on his face, lifeless and colourless, Then on those forms divine that lived and breathed, And would live on for ages—all were moved; And sighs burst forth, and loudest lamentations. THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME. Have none appeared as tillers of the ground, None since They went—as though it still were theirs, And they might come and claim their own again? Was the last plough a Roman's? From this Seat, Sacred for ages, whence, as Virgil sings, The Queen of Heaven, alighting from the sky, Looked down and saw the armies in array, Let us contemplate; and, where dreams from Jove Descended on the sleeper, where perhaps Some inspirations may be lingering still, Some glimmerings of the future or the past, Let us await their influence; silently Revolving, as we rest on the green turf, The changes from that hour when He from Troy Came up the Tiber; when refulgent shields, No strangers to the iron-hail of war, Streamed far and wide, and dashing oars were heard Among those woods where Silvia's stag was lying, His antlers gay with flowers; among those woods Where by the Moon, that saw and yet withdrew not, Two were so soon to wander and be slain, Two lovely in their lives, nor in their death Divided. Then, and hence to be discerned, How many realms, pastoral and warlike, lay Along this plain, each with its schemes of power, Its little rivalships! What various turns Of fortune there; what moving accidents From ambuscade and open violence! Mingling, the sounds came up; and hence how oft We might have caught among the trees below, Glittering with helm and shield, the men of Tibur; Or in Greek vesture, Greek their origin, Some embassy, ascending to Præneste; How oft descried, without thy gates, Aricia, Entering the solemn grove for sacrifice, Senate and People!—Each a busy hive, Glowing with life! But all ere long are lost In one. We look, and where the river rolls Southward its shining labyrinth, in her strength. A City, girt with battlements and towers, On seven small hills is rising. Round about, At rural work, the Citizens are seen, None unemployed; the noblest of them all Binding their sheaves or on their threshing-floors, As though they had not conquered. Every where Some trace of valour or heroic toil! Here is the sacred field of the Horatii. There are the Quintian meadows. Here the Hill How holy, where a generous people, twice, Twice going forth, in terrible anger sate Armed; and, their wrongs redressed, at once gave way, Helmet and shield, and sword and spear thrown down, And every hand uplifted, every heart Poured out in thanks to heaven. Once again We look; and lo, the sea is white with sails Innumerable, wafting to the shore Treasures untold; the vale, the promontories, A dream of glory; temples, palaces, Called up as by enchantment; aqueducts Among the groves and glades rolling along Rivers, on many an arch high over-head; And in the centre, like a burning sun, The Imperial City! They have now subdued All nations. But where they who led them forth; Who, when at length released by victory, (Buckler and spear hung up—but not to rust) Held poverty no evil, no reproach, Living on little with a cheerful mind, The Decii, the Fabricii? Where the spade, And reaping-hook, among their household-things Duly transmitted? In the hands of men Made captive; while the master and his guests, Reclining, quaff in gold, and roses swim, Summer and winter, through the circling year, On their Falernian—in the hands of men Dragged into slavery with how many more Spared but to die, a public spectacle, In combat with each other, and required To fall with grace, with dignity—to sink While life is gushing, and the plaudits ring Faint and yet fainter on their failing ear, As models for the sculptor. But their days, Their hours are numbered. Hark, a yell, a shriek, A barbarous out-cry, loud and louder yet, That echoes from the mountains to the sea! And mark, beneath us, like a bursting cloud, The battle moving onward! Had they slain All, that the Earth should from her womb bring forth New nations to destroy them? From the depth Of forests, from what none had dared explore, Regions of thrilling ice, as though in ice Engendered, multiplied, they pour along, Shaggy and huge! Host after host, they come; The Goth, the Vandal; and again the Goth! Once more we look, and all is still as night, All desolate! Groves, temples, palaces, Swept from the sight; and nothing visible, Amid the sulphurous vapours that exhale As from a land accurst, save here and there An empty tomb, a fragment like the limb Of some dismembered giant. In the midst A City stands, her domes and turrets crowned With many a cross; but they, that issue forth, Wander like strangers who had built among The mighty ruins, silent, spiritless; And on the road, where once we might have met Cæsar and Cato and men more than kings, We meet, none else, the pilgrim and the beggar. THE ROMAN PONTIFFS. Those ancient men, what were they, who achieved A sway beyond the greatest conquerors; Setting their feet upon the necks of kings, And, through the world, subduing, chaining down The free, immortal spirit? Were they not Mighty magicians? Theirs a wondrous spell. Where true and false were with infernal art Close-interwoven; where together met Blessings and curses, threats and promises; And with the terrors of Futurity Mingled whate'er enchants and fascinates, Music and painting, sculpture, rhetoric, And dazzling light and darkness visible, And architectural pomp, such as none else! What in his day the Syracusan sought, Another world to plant his engines on, They had; and, having it, like gods not men Moved this world at their pleasure. Ere they came, Their shadows, stretching far and wide, were known; And Two, that looked beyond the visible sphere, Gave notice of their coming—he who saw The Apocalypse; and he of elder time, Who in an awful vision of the night Saw the Four Kingdoms. Distant as they were, Those holy men, well might they faint with fear! THE NUN. Tis over; and her lovely cheek is now On her hard pillow—there, alas, to be Nightly, through many and many a dreary hour, Wan, often wet with tears, and (ere at length Her place is empty, and another comes) In anguish, in the ghastliness of death; Hers never more to leave those mournful walls, Even on her bier. 'Tis over; and the rite, With all its pomp and harmony, is now Floating before her. She arose at home, To be the show, the idol of the day; Her vesture gorgeous, and her starry head— No rocket, bursting in the midnight-sky, So dazzling. When to-morrow she awakes, She will awake as though she still was there, Still in her father's house; and lo, a cell Narrow and dark, nought through the gloom discerned, Nought save the crucifix, the rosary, And the grey habit lying by to shroud Her beauty and grace. When on her knees she fell, Entering the solemn place of consecration, And from the latticed gallery came a chant Of psalms, most saint-like, most angelical, Verse after verse sung out how holily, The strain returning, and still, still returning, Methought it acted like a spell upon her, And she was casting off her earthly dross; Yet was it sad as sweet, and, ere it closed, Came like a dirge. When her fair head was shorn, And the long tresses in her hands were laid, That she might fling them from her, saying, “Thus, Thus I renounce the world and worldly things!” When, as she stood, her bridal ornaments Were, one by one, removed, even to the last, That she might say, flinging them from her, “Thus, Thus I renounce the world!” when all was changed, And, as a nun, in homeliest guise she knelt, Distinguished only by the crown she wore, Her crown of lilies as the spouse of Christ, Well might her strength forsake her, and her knees Fail in that hour! Well might the holy man, He, at whose feet she knelt, give as by stealth ('Twas in her utmost need; nor, while she lives, Will it go from her, fleeting as it was) That faint but fatherly smile, that smile of love And pity! Like a dream the whole is fled; And they, that came in idleness to gaze Upon the victim dressed for sacrifice, Are mingling in the world; thou in thy cell Forgot, Teresa. Yet, among them all, None were so formed to love and to be loved, None to delight, adorn; and on thee now A curtain, blacker than the night, is dropped For ever! In thy gentle bosom sleep Feelings, affections, destined now to die, To wither like the blossom in the bud, Those of a wife, a mother; leaving there A cheerless void, a chill as of the grave, A languor and a lethargy of soul, Death-like, and gathering more and more, till Death Comes to release thee. Ah, what now to thee, What now to thee the treasure of thy Youth? As nothing! But thou canst not yet reflect Calmly; so many things, strange and perverse, That meet, recoil, and go but to return, The monstrous birth of one eventful day, Troubling thy spirit—from the first at dawn, The rich arraying for the nuptial feast, To the black pall, the requiem. All in turn Revisit thee, and round thy lowly bed Hover, uncalled. Thy young and innocent heart, How is it beating? Has it no regrets? Discoverest thou no weakness lurking there? But thine exhausted frame has sunk to rest. Peace to thy slumbers! THE FIRE-FLY. There is an Insect, that, when Evening comes, Small though he be and scarce distinguishable, Like Evening clad in soberest livery, Unsheathes his wings and through the woods and glades Scatters a marvellous splendour. On he wheels, Blazing by fits as from excess of joy, Each gush of light a gush of ecstasy; Nor unaccompanied; thousands that fling A radiance all their own, not of the day, Thousands as bright as he, from dusk till dawn, Soaring, descending. In the mother's lap Well may the child put forth his little hands, Singing the nursery song he learnt so soon; And the young nymph, preparing for the dance By brook or fountain-side, in many a braid Wreathing her golden hair, well may she cry, “Come hither;” and the shepherds, gathering round, Shall say, “Floretta emulates the Night, Spangling her head with stars.” Oft have I met This shining race, when in the Tusculan groves My path no longer glimmered; oft among Those trees, religious once and always green, That still dream out their stories of old Rome Over the Alban lake; oft met and hailed, Where the precipitate Anio thunders down, And through the surging mist a Poet's house (So some aver, and who would not believe?) Reveals itself.—Yet cannot I forget Him, who rejoiced me in those walks at eve, My earliest, pleasantest; who dwells unseen, And in our northern clime, when all is still, Nightly keeps watch, nightly in bush or brake His lonely lamp rekindling. Unlike theirs, His, if less dazzling, through the darkness knows No intermission; sending forth its ray Through the green leaves, a ray serene and clear As Virtue's own. THE FOUNTAIN. It was a well Of whitest marble, white as from the quarry; And richly wrought with many a high relief, Greek sculpture—in some earlier day perhaps A tomb, and honoured with a hero's ashes. The water from the rock filled and o'erflowed; Then dashed away, playing the prodigal, And soon was lost—stealing unseen, unheard, Thro' the long grass, and round the twisted roots Of aged trees; discovering where it ran By the fresh verdure. Overcome with heat, I threw me down; admiring, as I lay, That shady nook, a singing-place for birds, That grove so intricate, so full of flowers, More than enough to please a child a-Maying. The sun had set, a distant convent-bell Ringing the Angelus; and now approached The hour for stir and village-gossip there, The hour Rebekah came, when from the well She drew with such alacrity to serve The stranger and his camels. Soon I heard Footsteps; and lo, descending by a path Trodden for ages, many a nymph appeared, Appeared and vanished, bearing on her head Her earthen pitcher. It called up the day Ulysses landed there; and long I gazed, Like one awaking in a distant time. At length there came the loveliest of them all, Her little brother dancing down before her; And ever as he spoke, which he did ever, Turning and looking up in warmth of heart And brotherly affection. Stopping there, She joined her rosy hands, and, filling them With the pure element, gave him to drink; And, while he quenched his thirst, standing on tip-toe, Looked down upon him with a sister's smile, Nor stirred till he had done, fixed as a statue. Then hadst thou seen them as they stood, Canova, Thou hadst endowed them with immortal youth; And they had evermore lived undivided, Winning all hearts—of all thy works the fairest. BANDITTI. Tis a wild life, fearful and full of change, The mountain robber's. On the watch he lies, Levelling his carbine at the passenger; And, when his work is done, he dares not sleep. Time was, the trade was nobler, if not honest; When they that robbed, were men of better faith Than kings or pontiffs; when, such reverence The Poet drew among the woods and wilds, A voice was heard, that never bade to spare, Crying aloud, “Hence to the distant hills! Tasso approaches; he, whose song beguiles The day of half its hours; whose sorcery Dazzles the sense, turning our forest-glades To lists that blaze with gorgeous armoury, Our mountain-caves to regal palaces. Hence, nor descend till he and his are gone. Let him fear nothing.”—When along the shore, And by the path that, wandering on its way, Leads through the fatal grove where Tully fell, (Grey and o'ergrown, an ancient tomb is there) He came and they withdrew, they were a race Careless of life in others and themselves, For they had learnt their lesson in a camp; But not ungenerous. 'Tis no longer so. Now crafty, cruel, torturing ere they slay The unhappy captive, and with bitter jests Mocking Misfortune; vain, fantastical, Wearing whatever glitters in the spoil; And most devout, though, when they kneel and pray, With every bead they could recount a murder; As by a spell they start up in array, As by a spell they vanish—theirs a band, Not as elsewhere of outlaws, but of such As sow and reap, and at the cottage-door Sit to receive, return the traveller's greeting; Now in the garb of peace, now silently Arming and issuing forth, led on by men Whose names on innocent lips are words of fear, Whose lives have long been forfeit.—Some there are That, ere they rise to this bad eminence, Lurk, night and day, the plague-spot visible, The guilt that says, Beware; and mark we now Him, where he lies, who couches for his prey At the bridge-foot in some dark cavity Scooped by the waters, or some gaping tomb, Nameless and tenantless, whence the red fox Slunk as he entered. There he broods, in spleen Gnawing his beard; his rough and sinewy frame O'erwritten with the story of his life: On his wan cheek a sabre-cut, well earned In foreign warfare; on his breast the brand Indelible, burnt in when to the port He clanked his chain, among a hundred more Dragged ignominiously; on every limb Memorials of his glory and his shame, Stripes of the lash and honourable scars, And channels here and there worn to the bone By galling fetters. He comes slowly forth, Unkennelling, and up that savage dell Anxiously looks; his cruise, an ample gourd, (Duly replenished from the vintner's cask) Slung from his shoulder; in his breadth of belt Two pistols and a dagger yet uncleansed, A parchment scrawled with uncouth characters, And a small vial, his last remedy, His cure, when all things fail. No noise is heard, Save when the rugged bear and the gaunt wolf Howl in the upper region, or a fish Leaps in the gulf beneath. But now he kneels; And (like a scout, when listening to the tramp Of horse or foot) lays his experienced ear Close to the ground, then rises and explores, Then kneels again, and, his short rifle-gun Against his cheek, waits patiently. Two Monks, Portly, grey-headed, on their gallant steeds, Descend where yet a mouldering cross o'erhangs The grave of one that from the precipice Fell in an evil hour. Their bridle-bells Ring merrily; and many a loud, long laugh Re-echoes; but at once the sounds are lost. Unconscious of the good in store below, The holy fathers have turned off, and now Cross the brown heath, ere long to wag their beards Before my lady-abbess, and discuss Things only known to the devout and pure O'er her spiced bowl—then shrive the sister-hood, Sitting by turns with an inclining ear In the confessional. He moves his lips As with a curse—then paces up and down, Now fast, now slow, brooding and muttering on; Gloomy alike to him Future and Past. But hark, the nimble tread of numerous feet! 'Tis but a dappled herd, come down to slake Their thirst in the cool wave. He turns and aims; Then checks himself, unwilling to disturb The sleeping echoes.—Once again he earths; Slipping away to house with them beneath, His old companions in that hiding-place, The bat, the toad, the blind-worm, and the newt; And hark, a footstep, firm and confident, As of a man in haste. Nearer it draws; And now is at the entrance of the den. Ha! 'tis a comrade, sent to gather in The band for some great enterprise. Who wants A sequel, may read on. The unvarnished tale, That follows, will supply the place of one. 'Twas told me by the Count St. Angelo, When in a blustering night he sheltered me In that brave castle of his ancestors O'er Garigliano, and is such indeed As every day brings with it—in a land Where laws are trampled on and lawless men Walk in the sun; but it should not be lost, For it may serve to bind us to our Country. AN ADVENTURE. Three days they lay in ambush at my gate, Then sprung and led me captive. Many a wild We traversed; but Rusconi, 'twas no less, Marched by my side, and, when I thirsted, climbed The cliffs for water; though, whene'er he spoke, 'Twas briefly, sullenly; and on he led, Distinguished only by an amulet, That in a golden chain hung from his neck, A crystal of rare virtue. Night fell fast, When on a heath, black and immeasurable, He turned and bade them halt. 'Twas where the earth Heaves o'er the dead—where erst some Alaric Fought his last fight, and every warrior threw A stone to tell for ages where he lay. Then all advanced, and, ranging in a square, Stretched forth their arms as on the holy cross, From each to each their sable cloaks extending, That, like the solemn hangings of a tent, Covered us round; and in the midst I stood, Weary and faint, and face to face with one, Whose voice, whose look dispenses life and death, Whose heart knows no relentings. Instantly A light was kindled and the Bandit spoke. “I know thee. Thou hast sought us, for the sport Slipping thy blood-hounds with a hunter's cry; And thou hast found at last. Were I as thou, I in thy grasp as thou art now in ours, Soon should I make a midnight-spectacle, Soon, limb by limb, be mangled on a wheel, Then gibbetted to blacken for the vultures. But I would teach thee better—how to spare. Write as I dictate. If thy ransom comes, Thou liv'st. If not—but answer not, I pray, Lest thou provoke me. I may strike thee dead; And know, young man, it is an easier thing To do it than to say it. Write, and thus.”— I wrote. “'Tis well,” he cried. “A peasant-boy, Trusty and swift of foot, shall bear it hence. Meanwhile lie down and rest. This cloak of mine Will serve thee; it has weathered many a storm.” The watch was set; and twice it had been changed, When morning broke, and a wild bird, a hawk, Flew in a circle, screaming. I looked up, And all were gone, save him who now kept guard And on his arms lay musing. Young he seemed, And sad, as though he could indulge at will Some secret grief. “Thou shrinkest back,” he said, “Well may'st thou, lying, as thou dost, so near A Ruffian—one for ever linked and bound To guilt and infamy. There was a time When he had not perhaps been deemed unworthy, When he had watched yon planet to its setting, And dwelt with pleasure on the meanest thing Nature gives birth to. Now, alas, 'tis past. Wouldst thou know more? My story is an old one. I loved, was scorned; I trusted, was betrayed; And in my anguish, my necessity, Met with the fiend, the tempter—in Rusconi. ‘Why thus?’ he cried. ‘Thou wouldst be free and dar'st not. Come and assert thy birth-right while thou canst. A robber's cave is better than a dungeon; And death itself, what is it at the worst, What, but a harlequin's leap?’ Him I had known, Had served with, suffered with; and on the walls Of Capua, while the moon went down, I swore Allegiance on his dagger.—Dost thou ask How I have kept my oath?—Thou shalt be told, Cost what it may. But grant me, I implore, Grant me a passport to some distant land, That I may never, never more be named. Thou wilt, I know thou wilt. Two months ago, When on a vineyard-hill we lay concealed And scattered up and down as we were wont, I heard a damsel singing to herself, And soon espied her, coming all alone, In her first beauty. Up a path she came, Leafy and intricate, singing her song, A song of love, by snatches; breaking off If but a flower, an insect in the sun Pleased for an instant; then as carelessly The strain resuming, and, where'er she stopt, Rising on tiptoe underneath the boughs To pluck a grape in very wantonness. Her look, her mien and maiden-ornaments Shewed gentle birth; and, step by step, she came, Nearer and nearer, to the dreadful snare. None else were by; and, as I gazed unseen, Her youth, her innocence and gaiety Went to my heart! and, starting up, I breathed, ‘Fly—for your life!’ Alas, she shrieked, she fell; And, as I caught her falling, all rushed forth. ‘A Wood-nymph!’ cried Rusconi. ‘By the light, Lovely as Hebe! Lay her in the shade.’ I heard him not. I stood as in a trance. ‘What,’ he exclaimed with a malicious smile, ‘Wouldst thou rebel?’ I did as he required. ‘Now bear her hence to the well-head below; A few cold drops will animate this marble. Go! 'Tis an office all will envy thee; But thou hast earned it.’ As I staggered down, Unwilling to surrender her sweet body; Her golden hair dishevelled on a neck Of snow, and her fair eyes closed as in sleep, Frantic with love, with hate, ‘Great God!’ I cried, (I had almost forgotten how to pray; But there are moments when the courage comes) ‘Why may I not, while yet—while yet I can, Release her from a thraldom worse than death?’ 'Twas done as soon as said. I kissed her brow, And smote her with my dagger. A short cry She uttered, but she stirred not; and to heaven Her gentle spirit fled. 'Twas where the path In its descent turned suddenly. No eye Observed me, tho' their steps were following fast. But soon a yell broke forth, and all at once Levelled with deadly aim. Then I had ceased To trouble or be troubled, and had now (Would I were there!) been slumbering in my grave, Had not Rusconi with a terrible shout Thrown himself in between us, and exclaimed, Grasping my arm, ‘'Tis bravely, nobly done! Is it for deeds like these thou wear'st a sword? Was this the business that thou cam'st upon? —But 'tis his first offence, and let it pass. Like the young tiger he has tasted blood, And may do much hereafter. He can strike Home to the hilt.’ Then in an under-tone, ‘Thus wouldst thou justify the pledge I gave, When in the eyes of all I read distrust? For once,’ and on his cheek, methought, I saw The blush of virtue, ‘I will save thee, Albert; Again I cannot.’” Ere his tale was told, As on the heath we lay, my ransom came; And in six days, with no ungrateful mind, Albert was sailing on a quiet sea. —But the night wears, and thou art much in need Of rest. The young Antonio, with his torch, Is waiting to conduct thee to thy chamber. NAPLES. This region, surely, is not of the earth. Was it not dropt from heaven? Not a grove, Citron or pine or cedar, not a grot Sea-worn and mantled with the gadding vine, But breathes enchantment. Not a cliff but flings On the clear wave some image of delight, Some cabin-roof glowing with crimson flowers, Some ruined temple or fallen monument, To muse on as the bark is gliding by. And be it mine to muse there, mine to glide, From day-break, when the mountain pales his fire Yet more and more, and from the mountain-top, Till then invisible, a smoke ascends, Solemn and slow, as erst from Ararat, When he, the Patriarch, who escaped the Flood, Was with his house-hold sacrificing there— From day-break to that hour, the last and best, When, one by one, the fishing-boats come forth, Each with its glimmering lantern at the prow, And, when the nets are thrown, the evening-hymn Steals o'er the trembling waters. Every where Fable and Truth have shed, in rivalry, Each her peculiar influence. Fable came And laughed and sung, arraying Truth in flowers, Like a young child her grandam. Fable came; Earth, sea and sky reflecting, as she flew, A thousand, thousand colours not their own: And at her bidding, lo! a dark descent To Tartarus, and those thrice happy fields, Those fields with ether pure and purple light Ever invested, scenes by Him portrayed, Who here was wont to wander, here invoke The sacred Muses, here receive, record What they revealed, and on the western shore Sleeps in a silent grove, o'erlooking thee, Beloved Parthenope. Yet here, methinks, Truth wants no ornament, in her own shape Filling the mind by turns with awe and love, By turns inclining to wild ecstasy, And soberest meditation. Here the vines Wed, each her elm, and o'er the golden grain Hang their luxuriant clusters, chequering The sunshine; where, when cooler shadows fall And the mild moon her fairy net-work weaves, The lute or mandoline, accompanied By many a voice yet sweeter than their own, Kindles, nor slowly; and the dance displays The gentle arts and witcheries of love, Its hopes and fears and feignings, till the youth Drops on his knee as vanquished, and the maid, Her tambourine uplifting with a grace Nature's and Nature's only, bids him rise. But here the mighty Monarch underneath, He in his palace of fire, diffuses round A dazzling splendour. Here, unseen, unheard, Opening another Eden in the wild, His gifts he scatters; save, when issuing forth In thunder, he blots out the sun, the sky, And, mingling all things earthly as in scorn, Exalts the valley, lays the mountain low, Pours many a torrent from his burning lake, And in an hour of universal mirth, What time the trump proclaims the festival, Buries some capital city, there to sleep The sleep of ages—till a plough, a spade Disclose the secret, and the eye of day Glares coldly on the streets, the skeletons; Each in his place, each in his gay attire, And eager to enjoy. Let us go round; And let the sail be slack, the course be slow, That at our leisure, as we coast along, We may contèmplate, and from every scene Receive its influence. The Cumæan towers, There did they rise, sun-gilt; and here thy groves, Delicious Baiæ. Here (what would they not?) The masters of the earth, unsatisfied, Built in the sea; and now the boatman steers O'er many a crypt and vault yet glimmering, O'er many a broad and indestructible arch, The deep foundations of their palaces; Nothing now heard ashore, so great the change, Save when the sea-mew clamours, or the owl Hoots in the temple. What the mountainous Isle Seen in the South? 'Tis where a Monster dwelt, Hurling his victims from the topmost cliff; Then and then only merciful, so slow, So subtle were the tortures they endured. Fearing and feared he lived, cursing and cursed; And still the dungeons in the rock breathe out Darkness, distemper. Strange, that one so vile Should from his den strike terror through the world; Should, where withdrawn in his decrepitude, Say to the noblest, be they where they might, “Go from the earth!” and from the earth they went. Yet such things were—and will be, when mankind, Losing all virtue, lose all energy; And for the loss incur the penalty, Trodden down and trampled. Let us turn the prow And, in the track of him who went to die, Traverse this valley of waters, landing where A waking dream awaits us. At a step Two thousand years roll backward and we stand, Like those so long within that awful Place, Immovable, nor asking, Can it be? Once did I linger there alone till day Closed, and at length the calm of twilight came, So grateful yet so solemn! At the fount, Just where the three ways meet, I stood and looked, ('Twas near a noble house, the house of Pansa) And all was still as in the long, long night That followed, when the shower of ashes fell, When they that sought Pompeii, sought in vain; It was not to be found. But now a ray, Bright and yet brighter, on the pavement glanced, And on the wheel-track worn for centuries, And on the stepping-stones from side to side, O'er which the maidens, with their water-urns, Were wont to trip so lightly. Full and clear, The moon was rising, and at once revealed The name of every dweller, and his craft; Shining throughout with an unusual lustre, And lighting up this City of the Dead. Mark, where within, as though the embers lived, The ample chimney-vault is dun with smoke. There dwelt a miller; silent and at rest His mill-stones now. In old companionship Still do they stand as on the day he went, Each ready for its office—but he comes not. And there, hard by (where one in idleness Has stopt to scrawl a ship, an armed man; And in a tablet on the wall we read Of shews ere long to be) a sculptor wrought, Nor meanly; blocks, half-chiselled into life, Waiting his call.—Here long, as yet attests The trodden floor, an olive-merchant drew From many an earthen jar, no more supplied; And here from his a vintner served his guests Largely, the stain of his o'erflowing cups Fresh on the marble. On the bench, beneath, They sate and quaffed and looked on them that passed, Gravely discussing the last news from Rome. But lo, engraven on a threshold-stone, That word of courtesy so sacred once, Hail! At a master's greeting we may enter. And lo, a fairy-palace! every where, As through the courts and chambers we advance, Floors of mosaic, walls of arabesque, And columns clustering in Patrician splendour. But hark, a footstep! May we not intrude? And now, methinks, I hear a gentle laugh, And gentle voices mingling as in converse! —And now a harp-string as struck carelessly, And now—along the corridor it comes— I cannot err, a filling as of baths! —Ah, no, 'tis but a mockery of the sense, Idle and vain! We are but where we were; Still wandering in a City of the Dead! A CHARACTER. One of two things Montrioli may have, My envy or compassion. Both he cannot. Yet on he goes, numbering as miseries, What least of all he would consent to lose, What most indeed he prides himself upon, And, for not having, most despises me. “At morn the minister exacts an hour; At noon the king. Then comes the council-board; And then the chase, the supper. When, ah when, The leisure and the liberty I sigh for? Not when at home; at home a miscreant-crew, That now no longer serve me, mine the service. And then that old hereditary bore, The steward, his stories longer than his rent-roll, Who enters, quill in ear, and, one by one, As though I lived to write and wrote to live, Unrolls his leases for my signature.” He clanks his fetters to disturb my peace. Yet who would wear them and become the slave Of wealth and power, renouncing willingly His freedom, and the hours that fly so fast, A burden or a curse when misemployed, But to the wise how precious—every day A little life, a blank to be inscribed With gentle deeds, such as in after-time Console, rejoice, whene'er we turn the leaf To read them? All, wherever in the scale, Have, be they high or low, or rich or poor, Inherit they a sheep-hook or a sceptre, Much to be grateful for; but most has he, Born in that middle sphere, that temperate zone, Where Knowledge lights his lamp, there most secure, And Wisdom comes, if ever, she who dwells Above the clouds, above the firmament, That Seraph sitting in the heaven of heavens. What men most covet, wealth, distinction, power, Are baubles nothing worth, that only serve To rouse us up, as children in the schools Are roused up to exertion. The reward Is in the race we run, not in the prize; And they, the few, that have it ere they earn it, Having, by favour or inheritance, These dangerous gifts placed in their idle hands, And all that should await on worth well-tried, All in the glorious days of old reserved For manhood most mature or reverend age Know not, nor ever can, the generous pride That glows in him who on himself relies, Entering the lists of life. PÆSTUM. March 4, 1815. They stand between the mountains and the sea; Awful memorials, but of whom we know not! The seaman, passing, gazes from the deck. The buffalo-driver, in his shaggy cloak, Points to the work of magic and moves on. Time was they stood along the crowded street, Temples of Gods! and on their ample steps What various habits, various tongues beset The brazen gates for prayer and sacrifice! Time was perhaps the third was sought for Justice; And here the accuser stood, and there the accused; And here the judges sate, and heard, and judged. All silent now!—as in the ages past, Trodden under foot and mingled, dust with dust. How many centuries did the sun go round From Mount Alburnus to the Tyrrhene sea, While, by some spell rendered invisible, Or, if approached, approached by him alone Who saw as though he saw not, they remained As in the darkness of a sepulchre, Waiting the appointed time! All, all within Proclaims that Nature had resumed her right, And taken to herself what man renounced; No cornice, triglyph, or worn abacus, But with thick ivy hung or branching fern; Their iron-brown o'erspread with brightest verdure! From my youth upward have I longed to tread This classic ground—And am I here at last? Wandering at will through the long porticoes, And catching, as through some majestic grove, Now the blue ocean, and now, chaos-like, Mountains and mountain-gulfs, and, half-way up, Towns like the living rock from which they grew? A cloudy region, black and desolate, Where once a slave withstood a world in arms. The air is sweet with violets, running wild Mid broken friezes and fallen capitals; Sweet as when Tully, writing down his thoughts, Those thoughts so precious and so lately lost, (Turning to thee, divine Philosophy, Ever at hand to calm his troubled soul) Sailed slowly by, two thousand years ago, For Athens; when a ship, if north-east winds Blew from the Pæstan gardens, slacked her course. On as he moved along the level shore, These temples, in their splendour eminent Mid arcs and obelisks, and domes and towers, Reflecting back the radiance of the west, Well might he dream of Glory!—Now, coiled up, The serpent sleeps within them; the she-wolf Suckles her young: and, as alone I stand In this, the nobler pile, the elements Of earth and air its only floor and roof, How solemn is the stillness! Nothing stirs Save the shrill-voiced cicala flitting round On the rough pediment to sit and sing; Or the green lizard rustling through the grass, And up the fluted shaft with short quick spring, To vanish in the chinks that Time has made. In such an hour as this, the sun's broad disk Seen at his setting, and a flood of light Filling the courts of these old sanctuaries, (Gigantic shadows, broken and confused, Athwart the innumerable columns flung) In such an hour he came, who saw and told, Led by the mighty Genius of the Place. Walls of some capital city first appeared, Half razed, half sunk, or scattered as in scorn; —And what within them? what but in the midst These Three in more than their original grandeur, And, round about, no stone upon another? As if the spoiler had fallen back in fear, And, turning, left them to the elements. 'Tis said a stranger in the days of old (Some say a Dorian, some a Sybarite; But distant things are ever lost in clouds) 'Tis said a stranger came, and, with his plough, Traced out the site; and Posidonia rose, Severely great, Neptune the tutelar God; A Homer's language murmuring in her streets, And in her haven many a mast from Tyre. Then came another, an unbidden guest. He knocked and entered with a train in arms; And all was changed, her very name and language! The Tyrian merchant, shipping at his door Ivory and gold, and silk, and frankincense, Sailed as before, but, sailing, cried “For Pæstum!” And now a Virgil, now an Ovid sung Pæstum's twice-blowing roses; while, within, Parents and children mourned—and, every year, ('Twas on the day of some old festival) Met to give way to tears, and once again Talk in the ancient tongue of things gone by. At length an Arab climbed the battlements, Slaying the sleepers in the dead of night; And from all eyes the glorious vision fled! Leaving a place lonely and dangerous, Where whom the robber spares, a deadlier foe Strikes at unseen—and at a time when joy Opens the heart, when summer-skies are blue, And the clear air is soft and delicate; For then the demon works—then with that air The thoughtless wretch drinks in a subtle poison Lulling to sleep; and, when he sleeps, he dies. But what are These still standing in the midst? The Earth has rocked beneath; the Thunder-bolt Passed thro' and thro', and left its traces there; Yet still they stand as by some Unknown Charter! Oh, they are Nature's own! and, as allied To the vast Mountains and the eternal Sea, They want no written history; theirs a voice For ever speaking to the heart of Man! AMALFI. He who sets sail from Naples, when the wind Blows fragrance from Posìlipo, may soon, Crossing from side to side that beautiful lake, Land underneath the cliff where, once among The children gathering shells along the shore, One laughed and played, unconscious of his fate; His to drink deep of sorrow, and, through life, To be the scorn of them that knew him not, Trampling alike the giver and his gift, The gift a pearl precious, inestimable, A lay divine, a lay of love and war, To charm, ennoble, and, from age to age, Sweeten the labour when the oar was plied Or on the Adrian or the Tuscan sea. There would I linger—then go forth again, And hover round that region unexplored, Where to Salvator (when, as some relate, By chance or choice he led a bandit's life, Yet oft withdrew, alone and unobserved, To wander through those awful solitudes) Nature revealed herself. Unveiled she stood, In all her wildness, all her majesty, As in that elder time ere Man was made. There would I linger—then go forth again; And he who steers due east, doubling the cape, Discovers, in a crevice of the rock, The fishing-town, Amalfi. Haply there A heaving bark, an anchor on the strand, May tell him what it is; but what it was, Cannot be told so soon. The time has been, When on the quays along the Syrian coast, 'Twas asked and eagerly, at break of dawn, “What ships are from Amalfi?” when her coins, Silver and gold, circled from clime to clime; From Alexandria southward to Sennaar, And eastward, through Damascus and Cabul And Samarcand, to thy great wall, Cathay. Then were the nations by her wisdom swayed; And every crime on every sea was judged According to her judgments. In her port Prows, strange, uncouth, from Nile and Niger met, People of various feature, various speech; And in their countries many a house of prayer, And many a shelter, where no shelter was, And many a well, like Jacob's in the wild, Rose at her bidding. Then in Palestine, By the way-side, in sober grandeur stood A Hospital, that, night and day, received The pilgrims of the west; and, when 'twas asked, “Who are the noble founders?” every tongue At once replied, “The merchants of Amalfi.” That Hospital, when Godfrey scaled the walls, Sent forth its holy men in complete steel; And hence, the cowl relinquished for the helm, That chosen band, valiant, invincible, So long renowned as champions of the Cross, In Rhodes, in Malta. For three hundred years There, unapproached but from the deep, they dwelt; Assailed for ever, yet from age to age Acknowledging no master. From the deep They gathered in their harvests; bringing home, In the same ship, relics of ancient Greece, That land of glory where their fathers lay, Grain from the golden vales of Sicily, And Indian spices. Through the civilized world Their Credit was ennobled into Fame; And, when at length they fell, they left mankind A legacy, compared with which the wealth Of Eastern kings—what is it in the scale? The mariner's compass. They are now forgot, And with them all they did, all they endured, Struggling with fortune. When Sicardi stood On his high deck, his falchion in his hand, And, with a shout like thunder, cried, “Come forth, And serve me in Salerno!” forth they came, Covering the sea, a mournful spectacle; The women wailing, and the heavy oar Falling unheard. Not thus did they return, The tyrant slain; though then the grass of years Grew in their streets. There now to him who sails Under the shore, a few white villages Scattered above, below, some in the clouds, Some on the margin of the dark blue sea And glittering through their lemon-groves, announce The region of Amalfi. Then, half-fallen, A lonely watch-tower on the precipice, Their ancient land-mark, comes. Long may it last; And to the seaman in a distant age, Though now he little thinks how large his debt, Serve for their monument! MONTE CASSINO. What hangs behind that curtain?”—“Wouldst thou learn? If thou art wise, thou wouldst not. 'Tis by some Believed to be His master-work, who looked Beyond the grave, and on the chapel-wall, As tho' the day were come, were come and past, Drew the Last Judgment. But the Wisest err. He who in secret wrought, and gave it life, For life is surely there and visible change, Life, such as none could of himself impart, (They who behold it, go not as they came, But meditate for many and many a day) Sleeps in the vault beneath. We know not much; But what we know, we will communicate. 'Tis in an ancient record of the House; And may it make thee tremble, lest thou fall! Once—on a Christmas-eve—ere yet the roof Rung with the hymn of the Nativity, There came a stranger to the convent-gate, And asked admittance; ever and anon, As if he sought what most he feared to find, Looking behind him. When within the walls, These walls so sacred and inviolate, Still did he look behind him; oft and long, With curling, quivering lip and haggard eye, Catching at vacancy. Between the fits, For here, 'tis said, he lingered while he lived, He would discourse and with a mastery, A charm by none resisted, none explained, Unfelt before; but when his cheek grew pale, (Nor was the respite longer, if so long, Than while a shepherd in the vale below Counts, as he folds, five hundred of his flock) All was forgotten. Then, howe'er employed, He would break off and start as if he caught A glimpse of something that would not be gone; And turn and gaze and shrink into himself, As though the Fiend were there and, face to face, Scowled o'er his shoulder. Most devout he was; Most unremitting in the Services; Then, only then, untroubled, unassailed; And, to beguile a melancholy hour, Would sometimes exercise that noble art He learnt in Florence; with a master's hand, As to this day the Sacristy attests, Painting the wonders of the Apocalypse. At length he sunk to rest and in his cell Left, when he went, a work in secret done, The portrait, for a portrait it must be, That hangs behind the curtain. Whence he drew, None here can doubt; for they that come to catch The faintest glimpse—to catch it and be gone, Gaze as he gazed, then shrink into themselves, Acting the self-same part. But why 'twas drawn, Whether, in penance, to atone for Guilt, Or to record the anguish Guilt inflicts, Or haply to familiarize his mind With what he could not fly from, none can say, For none could learn the burden of his soul.” THE HARPER. It was a Harper, wandering with his harp, His only treasure; a majestic man, By time and grief ennobled, not subdued; Though from his height descending, day by day, And, as his upward look at once betrayed, Blind as old Homer. At a fount he sate, Well-known to many a weary traveller; His little guide, a boy not seven years old, But grave, considerate beyond his years, Sitting beside him. Each had ate his crust In silence, drinking of the virgin-spring; And now in silence, as their custom was, The sun's decline awaited. But the child Was worn with travel. Heavy sleep weighed down His eye-lids; and the grandsire, when we came, Emboldened by his love and by his fear, His fear lest night o'ertake them on the road, Humbly besought me to convey them both A little onward. Such small services Who can refuse—Not I; and him who can, Blest though he be with every earthly gift, I cannot envy. He, if wealth be his, Knows not its uses. So from noon till night, Within a crazed and tattered vehicle, That yet displayed, in rich emblazonry, A shield as splendid as the Bardi wear, We lumbered on together; the old man Beguiling many a league of half its length, When questioned the adventures of his life, And all the dangers he had undergone; His ship-wrecks on inhospitable coasts, And his long warfare.—They were bound, he said, To a great fair at Reggio; and the boy, Believing all the world were to be there, And I among the rest, let loose his tongue, And promised me much pleasure. His short trance, Short as it was, had, like a charmed cup, Restored his spirit, and, as on we crawled, Slow as the snail (my muleteer dismounting, And now his mules addressing, now his pipe, And now Luigi) he poured out his heart, Largely repaying me. At length the sun Departed, setting in a sea of gold; And, as we gazed, he bade me rest assured That like the setting would the rising be. Their harp—it had a voice oracular, And in the desert, in the crowded street, Spoke when consulted. If the treble chord Twanged shrill and clear, o'er hill and dale they went, The grandsire, step by step, led by the child; And not a rain-drop from a passing cloud Fell on their garments. Thus it spoke to-day; Inspiring joy, and, in the young one's mind, Brightening a path already full of sunshine. THE FELUCA. Day glimmered; and beyond the precipice (Which my mule followed as in love with fear, Or as in scorn, yet more and more inclining To tempt the danger where it menaced most) A sea of vapour rolled. Methought we went Along the utmost edge of this, our world, And the next step had hurled us headlong down Into the wild and infinite abyss; But soon the surges fled, and we descried Nor dimly, though the lark was silent yet, Thy gulf, La Spezzia. Ere the morning-gun, Ere the first day-streak, we alighted there; And not a breath, a murmur! Every sail Slept in the offing. Yet along the shore Great was the stir; as at the noontide hour, None unemployed. Where from its native rock A streamlet, clear and full, ran to the sea, The maidens knelt and sung as they were wont, Washing their garments. Where it met the tide, Sparkling and lost, an ancient pinnace lay Keel upward, and the faggot blazed, the tar Fumed from the cauldron; while, beyond the fort, Whither I wandered, step by step led on, The fishers dragged their net, the fish within At every heave fluttering and full of life, At every heave striking their silver fins 'Gainst the dark meshes. Soon a boatman's shout Re-echoed; and red bonnets on the beach, Waving, recalled me. We embarked and left That noble haven, where, when Genoa reigned, A hundred galleys sheltered—in the day When lofty spirits met and, deck to deck, Doria, Pisani fought; that narrow field Ample enough for glory. On we went Ruffling with many an oar the crystalline sea, On from the rising to the setting sun In silence—underneath a mountain-ridge, Untamed, untameable, reflecting round The saddest purple; nothing to be seen Of life or culture, save where, at the foot, Some village and its church, a scanty line, Athwart the wave gleamed faintly. Fear of Ill Narrowed our course, fear of the hurricane, And that still greater scourge, the crafty Moor, Who, like a tiger prowling for his prey, Springs and is gone, and on the adverse coast (Where Tripoli and Tunis and Algiers Forge fetters, and white turbans on the mole Gather whene'er the Crescent comes displayed Over the Cross) his human merchandize To many a curious, many a cruel eye Exposes. Ah, how oft, where now the sun Slept on the shore, have ruthless scimitars Flashed through the lattice, and a swarthy crew Dragged forth, ere long to number them for sale, Ere long to part them in their agony, Parent and child! How oft, where now we rode Over the billow, has a wretched son, Or yet more wretched sire, grown grey in chains, Laboured, his hands upon the oar, his eyes Upon the land—the land, that gave him birth; And, as he gazed, his homestall through his tears Fondly imagined; when a Christian ship Of war appearing in her bravery, A voice in anger cried, “Use all your strength!” But when, ah when, do they that can, forbear To crush the unresisting? Strange, that men, Creatures so frail, so soon, alas, to die, Should have the power, the will to make this world A dismal prison-house, and life itself, Life in its prime, a burden and a curse To him who never wronged them? Who that breathes Would not, when first he heard it, turn away As from a tale monstrous, incredible? Surely a sense of our mortality, A consciousness how soon we shall be gone, Or, if we linger—but a few short years— How sure to look upon our brother's grave, Should of itself incline to pity and love, And prompt us rather to assist, relieve, Than aggravate the evils each is heir to. At length the day departed, and the moon Rose like another sun, illumining Waters and woods and cloud-capt promontories, Glades for a hermit's cell, a lady's bower, Scenes of Elysium, such as Night alone Reveals below, nor often—scenes that fled As at the waving of a wizard's wand, And left behind them, as their parting gift, A thousand nameless odours. All was still; And now the nightingale her song poured forth In such a torrent of heart-felt delight, So fast it flowed, her tongue so voluble, As if she thought her hearers would be gone Ere half was told. 'Twas where in the north-west, Still unassailed and unassailable, Thy pharos, Genoa, first displayed itself, Burning in stillness on its craggy seat; That guiding star so oft the only one, When those now glowing in the azure vault Are dark and silent. 'Twas where o'er the sea, (For we were now within a cable's length,) Delicious gardens hung; green galleries, And marble terraces in many a flight, And fairy-arches flung from cliff to cliff, Wildering, enchanting; and, above them all, A Palace, such as somewhere in the East, In Zenastan or Araby the blest, Among its golden groves and fruits of gold, And fountains scattering rainbows in the sky, Rose, when Aladdin rubbed the wondrous lamp; Such, if not fairer; and, when we shot by, A scene of revelry, in long array As with the radiance of the setting sun, The windows blazing. But we now approached A City far-renowned; and wonder ceased. GENOA. This house was Andrea Doria's. Here he lived; And here at eve relaxing, when ashore, Held many a pleasant, many a grave discourse With them that sought him, walking to and fro As on his deck. 'Tis less in length and breadth Than many a cabin in a ship of war; But 'tis of marble and at once inspires The reverence due to ancient dignity. He left it for a better; and 'tis now A house of trade, the meanest merchandise Cumbering its floors. Yet, fallen as it is, 'Tis still the noblest dwelling—even in Genoa! And hadst thou, Andrea, lived there to the last, Thou hadst done well; for there is that without, That in the wall, which monarchs could not give, Nor thou take with thee, that which says aloud, It was thy Country's gift to her Deliverer. 'Tis in the heart of Genoa (he who comes, Must come on foot) and in a place of stir; Men on their daily business, early and late, Thronging thy very threshold. But, when there, Thou wert among thy fellow-citizens, Thy children, for they hailed thee as their sire; And on a spot thou must have loved, for there, Calling them round, thou gav'st them more than life, Giving what, lost, makes life not worth the keeping. There thou didst do indeed an act divine; Nor couldst thou leave thy door or enter in, Without a blessing on thee. Thou art now Again among them. Thy brave mariners They who had fought so often by thy side, Staining the mountain-billows, bore thee back; And thou art sleeping in thy funeral-chamber. Thine was a glorious course; but couldst thou there, Clad in thy cere-cloth—in that silent vault, Where thou art gathered to thy ancestors— Open thy secret heart and tell us all, Then should we hear thee with a sigh confess, A sigh how heavy, that thy happiest hours Were passed before these sacred walls were left, Before the ocean-wave thy wealth reflected, And pomp and power drew envy, stirring up The ambitious man, that in a perilous hour Fell from the plank. A FAREWELL. And now farewell to Italy—perhaps For ever! Yet, methinks, I could not go, I could not leave it, were it mine to say, “Farewell for ever!” Many a courtesy, That sought no recompense, and met with none But in the swell of heart with which it came, Have I experienced; not a cabin-door, Go where I would, but opened with a smile; From the first hour, when, in my long descent, Strange perfumes rose, rose as to welcome me, From flowers that ministered like unseen spirits; From the first hour, when vintage-songs broke forth, A grateful earnest, and the Southern lakes, Dazzlingly bright, unfolded at my feet; They that receive the cataracts, and ere long Dismiss them, but how changed—onward to roll From age to age in silent majesty, Blessing the nations, and reflecting round The gladness they inspire. Gentle or rude, No scene of life but has contributed Much to remember—from the Polesine, Where, when the south-wind blows and clouds on clouds Gather and fall, the peasant freights his boat, A sacred ark, slung in his orchard-grove; Mindful to migrate when the king of floods Visits his humble dwelling, and the keel, Slowly uplifted over field and fence, Floats on a world of waters—from that low, That level region, where no Echo dwells, Or, if she comes, comes in her saddest plight, Hoarse, inarticulate—on to where the path Is lost in rank luxuriance, and to breathe Is to inhale distemper, if not death; Where the wild-boar retreats, when hunters chafe, And, when the day-star flames, the buffalo-herd, Afflicted, plunge into the stagnant pool, Nothing discerned amid the water-leaves, Save here and there the likeness of a head, Savage, uncouth; where none in human shape Comes, save the herdsman, levelling his length Of lance with many a cry, or, Tartar-like, Urging his steed along the distant hill As from a danger. There, but not to rest, I travelled many a dreary league, nor turned (Ah then least willing, as who had not been?) When in the South, against the azure sky, Three temples rose in soberest majesty, The wondrous work of some heroic race. But now a long farewell! Oft, while I live, If once again in England, once again In my own chimney-nook, as Night steals on, With half-shut eyes reclining, oft, methinks, While the wind blusters and the drenching rain Clatters without, shall I recall to mind The scenes, occurrences, I met with here And wander in Elysium; many a note Of wildest melody, magician-like Awakening, such as the Calabrian horn Along the mountain-side, when all is still, Pours forth at folding-time; and many a chant, Solemn, sublime, such as at midnight flows From the full choir, when richest harmonies Break the deep silence of thy glens, La Cava; To him who lingers there with listening ear Now lost and now descending as from Heaven! And now a parting word is due from him Who, in the classic fields of Italy, (If haply thou hast borne with him so long,) Through many a grove by many a fount has led thee, By many a temple half as old as Time; Where all was still awakening them that slept, And conjuring up where all was desolate, Where kings were mouldering in their funeral urns, And oft and long the vulture flapped his wing— Triumphs and masques. Nature denied him much, But gave him at his birth what most he values; A passionate love for music, sculpture, painting, For poetry, the language of the gods, For all things here, or grand or beautiful, A setting sun, a lake among the mountains, The light of an ingenuous countenance, And what transcends them all, a noble action. Nature denied him much, but gave him more; And ever, ever grateful should he be, Though from his cheek, ere yet the down was there Health fled; for in his heaviest hours would come Gleams such as come not now; nor failed he then, (Then and through life his happiest privilege) Full oft to wander where the Muses haunt, Smit with the love of song. 'Tis now long since; And now, while yet 'tis day, would he withdraw, Who, when in youth he strung his lyre, addressed A former generation. Many an eye, Bright as the brightest now, is closed in night, And many a voice, how eloquent, is mute, That, when he came, disdained not to receive His lays with favour. 1839. THE END.</field>
