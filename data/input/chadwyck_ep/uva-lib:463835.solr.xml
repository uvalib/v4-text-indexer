      <field name="fulltext">THE CHERRIE AND THE SLAE (WREITTOUN TEXT) 1 About a Bank with balmie bewes, where nightingals their nots renews, With gallant Goldspinks gay, The Mavise, Mirle, and Progne proud, The Lintwhite, Lark, and Laverock loud, Saluted mirthful May. When Philomel had sweetly sung, To Progne she deplored, How Tereus cut out her tongue, And falsely her deflorde; Which storie, so sorie, To shew ashamd she seemde, To heare her so neare her, I doubted if I dream'd. 2 The Cushat crouds, the Corbie cries, The Cuckow couks, the pratling Pyes To geck her they begin. The Iargoun of the iangling Iayes, The craiking Crawes, the keckling Kayes, They deav'd me with their din. The painted Pawne, with Argoes eyes, Can on his Mayock cal; The Turtle wailes on withered trees, And Echo answered all, Repeiting, with greiting, How faire Narcissus fell, By lying, and spying, His shadow in the Well. 3 I saw the Hurcheon and the Hare In hidlings hirpling heere and there, To make their morning mange; The Con, the Conny, and the Cat, Whese dainty dounes with dew were wat, With stiffe mustaches strang; The Hart, the Hynd, the Dae, the Rae, The Fulmart, and false Foxe: The bearded Buck clamb up the brae, With birsie Baires and Brocks. Some feeding, some dreading, The Hunters subtile snares, With skipping and tripping, They plaid them all in paires. 4 The aire was sober, soft and sweet, But mistie vapours, wind, and weet, But quyet, calme and cleare, To foster Floras fragrant flowres, Whereon Apollos paramours Had trinckled many a teare; The which like silver shakers shynde, Imbrodering beauties bed, Wherewith their heavy heads declinde, In Mayes colours clad: Some knopping, some dropping Of balmie liquor sweet, Excelling in smelling, Through Phœbus wholsome heat. 5 Mee thought an heavenly heartsome thing, Where dew like Diamonds did hing, Ou'r twinckling all the trees, To study on the flourishde twists, Admiring natures alcumists, Laborious busie Bees, Whereof some sweetest hony sought To stay their lives to sterve; And some the waxie vessels wrought, Their purchase to preserve: So heaping for keeping, It in their hyves they hide; Precisely, and wisely, For winter they provide. 6 To pen the pleasures of that Parke, How every blossome, branch, &amp; bark, Against the Sun did shine, I passe to Poets to compile In high heroick stately stile, Whose Muse surmatches mine. But, as I looked mine alone, I saw a river rinne Out ou'r a steepie rock of stone, Syne lighted in a linne, With tumbling, and rumbling, Amongst the Roches round, Devalling, and falling, Into a pit profound. 7 Through routing of the river rang The Roches, sounding like a sang, Where Descant did abound, With Treble, Tenor, Counter, Meene; An echo blew a Basse between, In Diapason sound, Set with the C-sol-fa-uth cleife, With long and large at list, With Quaver, Crotchet, Semi-briefe, And not a Minim mist: Compleetly, and sweetly She firdound flat and sharp, Than Muses, which uses To pin Apollos harpe. 8 Who would have tyr'd to heare that tone? Which birds corroborate ay abone, With layes of lovesome Larks; Which climb so high in Christal skyes, While Cupid wakned with the cryes Of natures chappel Clarks; Who, leaving al the heavens above, Alighted on the eard. Lo! how that litle Lord of love Before me there appeard! So mild-like, and child-like, With bow three quarters skant; Syne moylie, and coylie, Hee looked like a Sant. 9 A cleanly crispe hang over his eyes; His Quaver by his naked thyes Hang in a silver lace: Of gold betweene his shoulders grew Two pretty wings wherewith he flew, On his left arme a brace. This god soone off his geare he shook Vpon the grassie ground: I ran as lightly for to looke Where ferlies might be found: Amazed, I gazed To see his geare so gay; Perceiving mine having, He counted mee his prey. 10 His youth and stature made mee stout; Of doublenesse I had no doubt, But bourded with my Boy. Quoth I, “how call they thee, my child?” “Cupido, sir,” quoth he, and smilde; “Please you mee to imploy? For I can serve you in your sute, If you please to impire, With wings to flee, and shafts to shute, Or flames to set on fire. Make choice then of those then, Or of a thousand things; But crave them, and have them:” With that I woo'd his wings. 11 “What would thou give, my heart,” quoth he, “To have these wanton wings to flee, To sport thy sprite a while? Or what if love should send thee heere Bow, quaver, shafts, and shooting geare, Somebody to beguile?” “This geare,” quoth I, “cannot be bought, Yet I would have it faine.” “What if,” quoth he, “it cost thee nought But rendring all againe?” His wings then he brings then, And band them on my back: “Goe flye now,” quoth he now, And so my leave I take. 12 I sprang up with Cupido's wings, Whose shots and shooting geare resignes, To lend me for a day: As Icarus with borrowed flight, I mounted higher than I might, Ou'r perilous a play. First foorth I drew the double dart Which sometimes shot his mother, Wherewith I hurt my wanton heart, In hope to hurt another. It hurt me, or burnt mee, While either end I handle: Come see now, in mee now, The Butterflee and candle. 13 As she delites into the low, So was I browden of my bow, As ignorant as she: And as she flyes while she is fir'de, So with the dart that I desirde, Mine hands hath hurt mee to. As foolish Phaeton by sute, His father's chaire obtainde, I longed in loves bow to shoote, Not marking what it mean'de: More wilful, than skilful, To flee I was so fond, Desiring, impyring, And so was seene upond. 14 Too late I knew, who hewes too high, The spaile shal fall into his eye: Too late I went to schooles: Too late I heard the swallow preach, Too late Experience doth teach— The Schoole-master of fooles. Too late I find the nest I seek, When all the birds are flowne; Too late the stable door I steeke, When as the steede is stowne. Too late ay, their state ay, As foolish folk espy; Behind so, they finde so Remead, and so doe I. 15 If I had ripely beene advisde, I had not rashly enterprisde To soare with borrowed pens; Nor yet had sayde the Archer-craft, To shoot myselfe with such a shaft As Reason quite miskens. Fra Wilfulnes gave me my wound, I had no force to flee; Then came I groning to the ground: “Friend, welcome home!” quoth he. “Where flew you? whom slew yee? Or who brings home the booting? I see now,” quoth he now, “Ye have beene at the shooting!” 16 As scorne comes commonly with skaith, So I behovde to bide them baith: So staggering was my state, That under cure I got such check, Which I might not remove nor neck, But either staile or mait. Mine agony was so extreame, I swelt and swound for feare; But, ere I wakned off my dreame, He spoild me of my geare. With flight then, on hight then, Sprang Cupid in the skyes, Forgetting, and setting At nought my carefull cries. 17 So long with sight I followed him, While both my dazeled eyes grew dimme Through staring of the starnes; Which flew so thick before mine eyne, Some red, some yellow, blew, and greene, Which troubled all mine harnes, That every thing appeared two To my barbuilied braine; But long might I lye looking so Ere Cupid came againe; Whose thundring, with wondring, I heard up through the Aire; Through clouds so, he thuddes so, And flew I wist not where. 18 Then when I saw that god was gone, And I in langour left alone, And sore tormented too, Sometime I sigh'd while I was sad, Sometime I musde, and most gone mad, I doubted what to doe; Sometime I rav'd halfe in a rage, As one into despare: To be opprest with such a page Lord! if my heart was saire! Like Dido, Cupido I widdle and I wary, Who reft mee, and left mee, in such a feirie farie. 19 Then felt I Courage and Desire Inflame mine heart with uncouth fire, To me before unknowne; But then no blood in me remaines, Vnburnt or boyld within my vaines, By loves bellowes blowne. To drowne it, ere I was devourde, With sighs I went about; But ay the more I shoope to smoor'de, The bolder it brake out, Ay preasing, but ceasing, While it might break the bounds: Mine hew so, foorth shew so, The dolour of my wounds. 20 With deadly visage, pale and wan, More like Anatomic than man, I withered cleane away: As waxe before the fire, I felt Mine heart within my bosome melt, And piece and piece decay, My veines by brangling like to break— My punses lap with pith— So fervency did mee infect, That I was vext therewith. Mine heart ay, it start ay, The firie flames to flee: Ay howping, through lowping, To leape at libertie. 21 But O! alas! it was abusde, My carefull corps kept it inclusde In prison of my breast, With sighs so sopped and ou'rset, Like to a fish fast in a net, In deadthraw undeceast; Which, though in vaine it strives by strength For to pul out her head, Which profites nothing at the length, But hastning to her dead; With thristing and wristing The faster still is sho; There I so, did lye so, My death advancing to. 22 The more I wrestled with the wind, The faster still my selfe I finde: No mirth my minde could mease. More noy than I had never none, I was so altered and ou'rgone, Through drouth of my disease: Yet weakly, as I might, I raise, My sight grew dimme and dark; I staggered at the windling strayes, No token I was stark. Both sightles, and mightles, I grew almost at once; In anguish I languish, With many grievous groanes. 23 With sober pace yet I approach Hard to the River and the Roch, Whereof I spake before; The river such a murmure made, As to the sea it softly slade: The Craige was stay and shore. Then Pleasure did me so provoke There partly to repaire, Betwixt the River and the Rocke, Where Hope grew with Despare. A tree then, I see then, Of Cherries on the Braes; Below, too, I saw, too, A bush of bitter Slaes. 24 The Cherries hang aboue mine head, Like trickling Rubies round and red, So high up in the Heugh; Whose shadowes in the river shew, As graithly [glancing], as they grew On trembling twists and teugh, Whiles bow'd through burden of their birth, Declining downe their tops: Reflexe of Phœbus off the firth Now coloured all their knoppes, With dancing, and glancing, In tirle as Dornick champe, Which streamed, and leamed, Through lightnes of that lampe. 25 With earnest eye, while I espy That fruite betwixt me and the skye, Halfe gate almost to Heaven; The Craige so cumbersome to climb, The tree so tall of growth, and trim As ony arrow even; I calde to minde how Daphne did Within the Lawrel shrinke, When from Apollo she her hid: A thousand times I thinke That tree there to mee there, As hee his Lawrel thought; Aspyring, but tyring, To get that fruite I sought. 26 To climb that Craige it was no buite, Let bee to prease to pul the fruite In top of all the tree: I know no way whereby to come, By any craft, to get it clum, Appearandly to mee: The Craige was ugly, stay and dreigh, The tree long, sound and small; I was affraide to climb so high, For feare to fetch a fall. Affrayed, I stayed, And looked up aloft, Whiles minting, whiles stinting, My purpose changed oft. 27 Then Dread, with Danger, and Despare, Forbade me minting any mare, To raxe above my reach. “What? tush!” quoth Courage, “man, go to, He is but daft that hath to doe, And spares for everie speach; For I have oft heard sooth men say, And we may see't ourselves, That Fortune helps the hardie ay, And pultrons ay repels. Then care not, an[d] feare not, Dread, Danger nor Despare: To fazards, hard hazards Is death, or they come there. 28 “Who speeds, but such as high aspyres? Who triumphs not, but such as tyres To win a noble name? Of shrinking what but shame succeeds? Then doe as thou would have thy deeds In register of fame. I put the case, thou not prevailde, So thou with honour die, Thy life, but not thy courage failde, Shal Poets pen of thee. Thy name then, from Fame then, Can never be cut off; Thy grave ay shal have ay That honest Epitaph. 29 “What canst thou losse, when honour lives? Renowne thy vertue ay revives, If valiantly thou end.” Quoth Danger: “huly, friend, take head; Vntimous spurring spilles the stead: Take tent what yee pretend. Thogh Courage counsel thee to climb, Beware thou kep no skaith: Have thou no helpe, but Hope and him, They may beguile thee baith. Thysell now can tell now The counsel of these Clarkes; Wherethrow yet, I trow yet, Thy breast doth beare the marks. 30 “Burnt bairne with fire the danger dreads; So I believe thy bosome bleeds, Since last that fire thou felt: Besides that seindle times thou sees That ever Courage keeps the keyes Of knowledge at his belt: Though he bid fordward with the Gunnes, Smal powder he provides: Be not a Novice of that Nunnes Who saw not both the sides. Fooles haste ay, almaist ay, Ou'rsyles the sight of some, Who luikes not, or huikes not, What afterward may come. 31 “Yet Wisedome wisheth thee to wey This figure in Philosophy— A lesson worth to leare— Which is, in time for to take tent, And not, when time is past, repent, And buy repentance deare. Is there no honour after life Except thou slay thy sel? Wherefore hath Atropus that knife? I trow thou canst not tell, Who but it, would cut it, Which Clotho scarce hath spun, Destroying the ioying, Before it be begun. 32 “All ou'rs are repute to be vice— Ou'r high, ou'r low, ou'r rash, ou'r nice, Ou're hote, or yet ou'r cold: Thou seemes unconstant by thy signes; Thy thought is on a thousand things; Thou wats not what thou would. Let Fame her pitty on thee powre, When all thy bones are broken: Yon Slae, suppose thou think it sowre, Would satisfie to sloken Thy drouth now, of youth now, Which dries thee with desire: Asswage then, thy rage then, Foule water quencheth fire. 33 “What foole art thou to die a thirst, And now may quench it, if thou list, So easily, but paine? More honour is to vanquish ane, Than fight with tensome and be tane, And either hurt or slay[ne]: The practick is to bring to passe, And not to enterprise; And as good drinking out of glasse As gold in any wise. I lever have ever A fowle in hand, or tway, Then seeing ten flying About me all the day. 34 “Looke where thou lights before thou loupe, And slip no certainty for Hope, Who guides thee but be gesse.” Quoth Courage, “cowards take no cure To sit with shame, so they be sure: I like them all the lesse. What pleasure purchast is but paine, Or honour won with ease? He wil not lye where he is slaine, Who doubts before he dies. For feare then, I heare then, But onely one remead, Which latt is, and that is, For to cut off the head. 35 “What is the way to heale thine hurt? What way is there to stay thy sturt? What meanes to make thee merrie? What is the comfort that thou craves? Suppose these Sophists thee deceaves, Thou knowes it is the Cherrie. Since for it onely thou but thirsts, The Slae can bee no buite: In it also thine health consists, And in none other fruite. Why quakes thou, and shakes thou, Or studies at our strife? Advise thee, it lyes thee, On no lesse than thy life. 36 “If any patient would be pansde, Why should he loupe when he is lansde, Or shrinke when he is shorne? For I have heard Chirurgians say, Oft-times deferring of a day Might not be mend the morne. Take time in time, ere time be tint, For time will not remaine: What forceth fire out of the flint, But as hard match againe? Delay not, nor fray not, And thou shall see it sa: Such gets ay, as sets ay, Stout stomackes to the brae. 37 “Though all beginning be most hard, The end is pleasant afterward; Then shrinke not for no showre: When once that thou thy greening get, Thy paine and travel is forget: The sweete exceeds the sowre. Goe to then quickly, feare no thir, For Hope good hap hath height.” Quoth Danger, “be not sudden, Sir, The matter is of weight. First spy both, then try both, Advisement doth none ill: Thou may then, I say then, Be wilful when thou will. 38 “But yet to minde the proverbe call, ‘Who uses perils perish shal’; Short while their life them lasts.” “And I have heard,” quoth Hope, “that he Should never shape to saile the sea, That for all perils casts. How many through Despare are dead That never perils priev'd! How many also, if thou read, Of lives have we releiv'd! Who being even dying, But Danger, but desparde; A hunder, I wonder, But thou hast heard declarde. 39 “If we two hold not up thine heart, Which is the chiefe and noblest part, Thy works would not goe well; Considering the companions can Disswade a silly, simple man To hazard for his heale. Suppose they have deceived some, Ere we and they might meete, They get no credance where we come, In any man of sprite; By reason, their treason By us is plainely spyde; Revealing their dealing, Which dow not be denyde. 40 “With sleekie Sophismes seeming sweete, As all their doing were discreet, They wish thee to be wise; Postponing time from houre to houre But, faith, in underneath the flowre, The lurking serpent lyes; Suppose thou seest her not a stime, While that she sting thy foote: Perceives thou not what precious time Thy sleuth doth overshoote? Alas, man, thy case, man, In lingring I lament: Goe to now, and doe now, That Courage be content. 41 “What if Melancholy come in, And get a grip ere thou begin? Then is thy labour lost; For he will hold thee hard and fast, Til time and place and fruite be past, And thou give up the ghost: Then shal be graven upon that place, Which on thy tombe is laid, ‘Sometime there liv'd such one’—alas, But how shal it bee said? ‘Heere lyes now, but prise now, Into dishonours bed, A cowart, (as thou art), Who from his fortune fled.’ 42 “Imagine, man, if thou were laid In grave, and syne might heare this said, Would thou not sweat for shame? Yes, faith, I doubt not but thou would; Therefore, if thou have eyes, behold How they would smore thy fame! Goe to, and make no more excuse, Ere life and honour losse, And either them or us refuse: There is no other chose. Consider, togidder, That we doe never dwell: At length ay, but strength ay, The pultrons we expell.” 43 Quoth Danger, “since I understand That counsall can be no command, I have no more to say; Except, if that you thinke it good, Take counsel yet, ere ye conclude, Of wiser men then they: They are but rackles, young and rash, Suppose they thinke us fleit: If of our fellowship ye fash, Goe with them hardly beit. God speed you, they lead you, Who have not meekle wit; Expel us, yeeil tell us, Heereafter comes not yet.” 44 While Danger and Despare retir'de, Experience came in, and spear'de What all the matter meande; With him came Reason, Wit, and Skill. Then they began to aske at Will, “Where make you to, my friend?” “To pluck yon lustie Cherrie, loe!” Quoth he, “and quyte the slae.” Quoth they, “is there no more adoe, Ere yee win up the brae, But doe it, and to it, Perforce your fruite to pluck? Well, brother, some other Were better to conduct. 45 “We grant yee may be good enough, But yet the hazard of yon heugh Requyres a graver guide. As wise as yee ar may goe wrang; Therefore take counsell, ere ye gang, Of some that stands beside. But who were yon three yee forbade Your company right now?” Quoth Wil, “three preachers to perswade The poysonde Slae to pull. They tratled and pratled, A long halfe hour and mare; Foul fal them! they call them Dread, Danger, and Despare. 46 “They are more fashions than of feck: Yon fazards durst not, for their neck, Climb up the Craige with us. Fra we determined to die, Or then to climbe the Cherrie tree, They bode about the bush. They are conditionde like the Cat— They would not weete their feete; But yet if any fish we gate, They would be apt to eate: Though they now, I say now, To hazard have no heart; Yet luck we, or pluck wee The fruite, they would not part. 47 “But when we get our voyage wun, They shal not then a Cherrie cun, Who would not enterprise.” “Well,” quoth Experience, “ye boast; But he that reckon'd but his hoast, Oftimes he counteth twise. Ye sell the Baires skin on his back, But bide while ye it get; When ye have done, its time to crack: Ye fish before the net. What haste, sir, ye taste, sir, The Cherrie, ere yee pow it: Beware, sir, ye are, sir, More talkative nor trowit.” 48 “Call Danger back againe,” quoth Skil, “To see what he can say to Wil, We see him shoad so straite: We may not trow what each one tels.” Quoth Courage, “we concluded els, He serves not for our mate; For I can tel you al perquiere His counsel ere he come.” Quoth Hope, “whereto should he come here? He cannot hold him dum: He speaks ay, and seeks ay Delayes oft times and drifts, To grieve us, and dieve us, With Sophistrie and shifts.” 49 Quoth Reason, “why was he debarde? The tale is ill cannot be heard; Yet let us heare him anes.” Then Danger to declare began, How Hope and Courage tooke the man, To leade them all their lanes; How they would have him up the hill, But either stoppe or stay; And who was welcomer than Will? He would be foremost ay: He could doe, and should doe, Who ever would or nought. Such speeding proceeding Vnlikely was, I thought. 50 “Therefore I wisht him to beware, And rashly not to run ou'r far, Without such guides as yee.” Quoth Courage, “friend, I heare you faile, Take better tent unto your tale, Ye said it could not bee: Besides that ye would not consent That ever we should clim.” Quoth Wil, “for my part I repent, We saw them more than him; For they are the stayare Of us, as well as hee: I thinke now they shrinke now: Goe forward, let them bee. 51 “Goe, goe, we doe nothing but guckes: They say the voyage never luckes, Where each one hath a vote.” Quoth Wisedome gravely, “Sir, I grant, We were no worse your vote to want, Some sentence now I note: Suppose you speake it but be gesse, Some fruite therein I finde; Ye would be foremost I confesse, But comes oft-times behind. It may be that they bee Deceiv'd that never doubted: Indeed, sir, that head, sir, Hath meekle wit about it.” 52 Then wilful Will began to rage, And swore he saw nothing in age, But anger, yre, and grudge: “And for myselfe,” quoth he, “I sweare To quyte all my companions heere, If they admit you iudge. Experience is growne so old, That he begins to rave: The rest, but Courage are so cold, No hazarding they have; For Danger, farre stranger, Hath made them than they were; Goe fra them, we pray them, Who neither dow nor dare. 53 “Why may not wee three leade this one? I led an hundreth mine alone, But counsel of them all.” “I grant,” quoth Wisedome, “ye have led; But I would speere, how many sped, Or furthered but a fall? But either few or none, I trow, Experience can tell. He sayes that man may wite but you, The first time that hee fell. He kens then, whose pens then, Thou borrowed him to flee. His wounds yet, which stounds yet, He got them then through thee.” 54 “That,” quoth Experience, “is true: Will flattered him, when first he flew, Wil set him in a low. Will was his counsell and convoy; Will borrowed from the blinded Boy Both Quaver, wings, and bow; Wherewith before he say'd to shoote, He neither yeeld to youth, Nor yet had need of any fruite, To quench his deadly drouth; Which pines him, and dwines him, To death, I wot not how: If Will then, did ill then, Himselfe remembers now. 55 “For I, Experience, was there, Like as I use to bee all where, What time hee wited Will To be the ground of all his griefe, As I my selfe can bee a priefe And witnes thereuntill. There are no bounds but I have beene, Nor hidlings from mee hid, Nor secret things but I have seene, That he or any did; Therefore now, no more now, Let him thinke to concealde; For why now, even I now Am debtbound to reveald.” 56 “My custome is for to declare The truth, and neither eke nor paire For any man a ioate: If wilful Will delytes in lyes, Example in thy selfe thou sees, How he can turne his coate, And with his language would allure Thee yet to breake thy bones: Thou knowes thyself if he be sure: Thou usde his counsell ones; Who would yet behold yet To wreak thee, were not wee. Thinke on you on yon now,” Quoth Wisedome then to mee. 57 “Wel,” quoth Experience, “if hee Submits himselfe to you and mee, I wote what I should say: Our good advise he shall not want, Providing alwayes that hee grant To put yon Will away, And banish both him and Despare, That all good purpose spils; So he will mell with them no mare, Let them two flyte their fils: Such cossing, but lossing, All honest men may use.” “That change now were strange now,” Quoth Reason, “to refuse.” 58 Quoth Will, “fy on him, when he flew, That powde not Cherries then anew For to have staide his hurt.” Quoth Reason, “though he beare the blame, He never saw nor needed them, While he himselfe had hurt. First when he mistred not, he might, He needs, and may not now: Thy folly, when he had his flight, Empashed him to pow. Both hee now, and we now, Perceives thy purpose plaine, To turne him, and burne him, And blow on him againe.” 59 Quoth Skil, “what would wee longer strive? Far better late than never thrive; Come let us helpe him yet: Tint time we may not get againe, We waste but present time in vaine:” “Beware with that,” quoth Wit: “Speak on, Experience, let see; We think you hold you dumb.” “Of bygones I have heard,” quoth he; “I know not things to come.” Quoth Reason, “the season, With slouthing slydes, away; First take him, and make him A man, if that you may.” 60 Quoth Will, “if he be not a man, I pray you, sirs, what is he than? He lookes like one at least.” Quoth Reason, “if he follow thee, And minde not to remaine with mee, Nought but a bruital beast. A man in shape doth nought consist, For all your tanting tales; Therefore, sir Will, I would yee wist Your Metaphysick failes. Goe leare yet, a yeare yet, Your Logick at the schooles, Some day then, yee may then Passe Master with the Mules.” 61 Quoth Will, “I marvel what you meane; Should I not trow mine own two eyne, For all your Logick schooles? If I did not, I were not wise.” Quoth Reason, “I have told you thrise, None ferlies more than fooles; There be more senses than the sight, Which ye ov'rhaile for haste, To wit, if ye remember right, Smel, hearing, touch, and taste. All quick things have such things, I meane both man and beast, By kinde ay, we finde ay, Few lackes them at the least. 62 “So, by that consequence of thine, Or Syllogisme said like a swine, A Kow may learne thee laire. Thou uses onely but the eyes: She touches, tastes, smels, heares, and sees; Which matches thee, and maire. But since no triumph yee intend, As presently appeares, Sir, for your Clergie to be kend, Take yee two asses eares. No Miter perfyter Got Midas for his meed; That hood, sir, is good, sir, To hap your braine-sick-head. 63 “Ye have no feele for to defyne, Though yee have cunning to decline A man to bee a moole: With little work yet, yee may vowde To grow a gallant horse and good, To ride thereon at Yoole. But to our ground where wee began, For all your gustlesse iests, I must be master of the man, But thou to bruital beasts; So wee two must bee two, To cause both kinds be knowne; Keep mine then from thine then, And each one use their owne.” 64 Then Will, as angry as an ape, Ran ramping, swearing, rude and rape, Saw he none other shift; He would not want an inch his wil, Even whether't did him good or ill, For thirty of his thrift: He would be formest in the field, And master, if he might; Yea, hee should rather die than yeeld, Though Reason had the right. “Shal he now, make mee now His subiect or his slave? No, rather my father Shal quick goe to the grave. 65 “I height him, while mine heart is haile, To perish first, ere he prevaile, Come after what so may.” Quoth Reason, “doubt yee not, indeed, Yet hitte the naile vpon the head: It shall bee as yee say. Suppose yee spur for to aspire, Your bridle wants a bit; That marke may leave you in the myre, As sicker as yee sit. Your sentence repentance Shall leave you, I believe, And anger you langer, When yee that practick prieve. 66 “As yee have dyted your decreet, Your prophecy to bee compleat, Perhaps, and to your paines; It hath beene said, and may be so, ‘A wilful man wants never woe’ Though he get little gaines. But since ye thinkt an easie thing To mount above the Moone, Of your owne fiddle take a spring, And dance when yee have done. If than, sir, the man, sir, Like of your mirth, hee may; And speare first, and heare first, What he himselfe will say.” 67 Then altogether they began And said, “Come on, thou martyrde man, What is thy will, advise.” Abasde, a bony while I stood, And musde, ere I mine answere made; I turnd me once or twise, Beholding everyone about, Whose motions mov'd me maist. Some seem'd assured, some dread for doubt, Will ran red-wood for haist, With wringing and flinging, For madnes like to mang; Despare too, for care too, Would needs himselfe goe hang; 68 Which when Experience perceiv'd, Quoth he, “remember if I rav'de, As Will allegde of late, When as he swore, nothing he saw In age, but anger, slack and slaw, And cankred in conceite: Ye could not lucke, as he alledgde, Who all opinions spearde. Hee was so frack and firie edg'd, He thought us foure but feard. ‘Who panses what chanses,’ Quoth hee, ‘no worship wins. To some best shal come best, Who hap wel, rack well rins.’ 69 “Yet,” quoth Experience, “behold, For all the tales that ye have told, How hee himselfe behaves. Because Despare could come no speed, Loe! heere he hings, all but the head, And in a widdy waves. If you be sure once, thou may see, To men that with them mels; If they had hurt or helped thee, Consider by themsels. Then chuse thee, to use thee By us, or such as yon: Syne soone now, have done now; Make either off or on.” 70 “Perceiv'st thou not wherefra proceeds The frantick fantasie that feeds Thy furious flamming fire? Which doth thy bailfull brest combur, That none, indeed,” quoth they, “can cure, Nor helpe thine hearts desire. The piercing passions of the spirit, Which wastes thy vitall breath, Doth hold thine heavy heart with heate: Desire drawes on thy death. Thy punces pronunces All kinde of quyet rest; That fever hath ever Thy person so opprest. 71 “Couldst thou come once acquaint with Skil, Hee knowes what humours doth thee ill, And how thy cares contracts; Hee knowes the ground of all thy griefe, And recipies of thy reliefe: All medicines hee makes.” Quoth Skil, “come on, content am I To put mine helping hand: Providing alwayes hee apply To counsel and command. While wee then,” quoth he then, “Are minded to remaine, Give place now, in cace now Thou get us not againe. 72 “Assure thy selfe, if that we shed, Thou shalt not get thy purpose sped; Take heede, wee have thee told. Have done, and drive not off the day: The man that will not when he may, He shal not when hee would. What wilt thou doe? I would we wist: Accept, or give us ou'r.” Quoth I, “I think me more than blest To finde such famous foure Beside mee, to guide mee, Now when I have to doe; Considering what swidering Ye found me first into. 73 “When Courage crav'd a stomack stout, And Danger drave mee into doubt, With his companion Dread: Whiles Wil would up above the aire; Whiles I am drownde in deepe Despare; Whiles Hope held up mine head. Such pithie reasons and replies, On every side they shew, That I, who was not very wise, Thought all their tales were true. So mony and bony, Old problemes they proponit, But quickly and likely, I marvell meekle on it. 74 “Yet Hope and Courage wan the field, Though Dread and Danger never yeeld, But fled to finde refuge: Yet, when ye foure came, they were faine, Because ye gart us come againe: The[y] griende to get you iudge. Where they were fugitive before, Yee made them frank and free To speak and stand in aw no more.” Quoth Reason, “so should bee: Oft-times now, but crymes now, But even perforce, it fals, The strong ay with wrong ay Puts weaker to the wals; 75 “Which is a fault, ye must confesse: Strength was not ordained to oppresse With rigour by the right; But, by the contrare, to sustaine The loaden which ov'rburthend beene, As meckle as they might.” “So Hope and Courage did,” quoth I, “Experimented like, Show skilde and pithy reasons why That Danger lap the dyke.” Quoth Dreid, “sir, take heed, sir; Long spoken part must spill; Insist not, we wist not We went against our will. 76 “With Courage ye were so content, Ye never sought our smal consent; Of us ye stood not aw. Then Logick lessons ye allowit, And was determined to trow it: Alleageance past for Law. For all the proverbs wee perusde, Yee thought them skantly skild; Our reasons had beene as well rusde, Had ye beene as well wil'de To our side as your side, So truely I may tearme it; I see now in thee now Affection doth affirm't.” 77 Experience then smirking smilde: “We are no bairnes to be beguild,” Quoth he, and shooke his head; “For Authors who alledges us, They stil would win about the bus To foster deadly feede: For wee are equal for you all; No persons wee respect; We have been so, are yet, and shall Be found so in effect. If we were as ye were, We had comde unrequyrde; But wee now, ye see now, Doe nothing undesirde. 78 “There is a sentence said by some, ‘Let none uncald to counsell come, That welcome weines to bee’; Yea, I have heard another yet, ‘Who came uncald, unserv'd shuld sit’; Perhaps, sir, so may yee.” “Good-man, grande mercie for your gecke,” Quoth Hope, and lowly lowts: “If yee were sent for, we suspect, Because the Doctours doubts. Your yeares now appeares now With wisedome to be vext, Reioycing in gloysing, Till you have tint your text. 79 “Where yee were sent for, let us see Who would be welcomer than wee? Prove that, and we are payde.” “Wel,” quoth Experience, “beware; You know not in what case you are; Your tongue hath you betrayde. The man may able tine a stot Who cannot count his kinch; In your owne bow you are ov'rshot, By more then halfe an inch. Who wats, sir, if that, sir, Is sowre, which seemeth sweet? I feare now ye heare now A dangerous decreete. 80 “Sir, by that sentence yee have said, I pledge, ere all the play bee plaid, That some shall lose a laike. Since yee but put me for to prove Such heads as help for my behove, Your warrand is but waike. Speare at the man your selfe, and see, Suppose you strive for state, If hee regrated not how hee Had learnd my lesson late, And granted hee wanted Both Reason, Wit, and Skill; Compleaning, and meaning, Our absence did him ill. 81 “Confront him further face for face, If yet hee rewes his rackles race, Perhaps and ye shall heare; For ay since Adam and since Eve, Who first thy leasings did believe, I sold thy doctrine deare. What hath beene done, even to this day, I keep in minde almaist: Ye promise further than ye pay, Sir Hope, for all your haste; Promitting, unwitting, Your heghts yee never hooked; I show you, I know you; Your bygones I have booked. 82 “I would, incace a count were crav'd, Shew thousand, thousands thou deceivde, Where thou was true to one; And, by the contrare, I may vant, Which thou must, though it grieve thee, grant, I trumped never a man, But truely told the naked trueth To men that meld with mee, For neither rigour nor for rueth, But onely loath to lie. To some yet to come yet Thy succour shall be slight; Which I then must try then, And register it right.” 83 “Ha, ha!” quoth Hope, and lowdly leugh, “Ye'r but a prentise at the pleugh, Experience, yee prieve. Suppose all bygones as yee spacke, Ye are no Prophet worth a plack, Nor I bound to believe. Yee should not say, sir, till yee see; But, when yee see it, say.” “Yet,” quoth Experience, “at thee Make many mints I may, By signes now, and things now, Which ay before mee beares, Expressing, by gessing, The perill that appeares.” 84 Then Hope replyde, and that with pith, And wisely weigh'd his words therewith Sententiously and short; Quoth hee, “I am the Anchor grip That saves the Sailers and their ship From perill, to their port.” Quoth hee, “oft times that Anchor drives, As wee have found before, And loses many thousand lives By shipwrack on the shore. Your grips oft but slips oft, When men have most to doe, Syne leaves them, and reaves them Of my companion too. 85 “Thou leaves them not thy selfe alone, But to their griefe when thou art gone Gars Courage quite them als.” Quoth Hope, “I would ye understood, I grip fast if the ground be good, And fleets where it is false. There should no fault with mee be found, Nor I accusde at all. Wyte such as should have sound the ground Before the Anchor fall. Their leede ay, at neede ay, Might warne them, if they would; If they there would stay there, Or have good anchor-hold. 86 “If yee read right, it was not I, But onely Ignorance, whereby Their Carvels all were cloven. I am not for a trumper tane.” “All,” quoth Experience, “is ane; I have my processe proven, To wit, that we were cald, each one, To come before wee came; That now obiection ye have none, Your selfe may say the same. Ye are now, too farre now, Come forward, for to flee; Perceive then, ye have then The worst end of the tree.” 87 When Hope was gald into the quick, Quoth Courage, kicking at the prick, “Wee let you well to wit; Make hee you welcomer than wee, Then bygones, bygones, farewell he, Except hee seeke us yet. Hee understands his owne estate, Let him his chiftanes chuse; But yet his battel will bee blate, If hee our force refuse. Refuse us, or chuse us, Our counsel is, hee clim; But stay hee, or stray hee, We have none help for him. 88 “Except the Cherrie be his chose, Bee ye his friends, wee are his foes; His doings we despite. If we perceive him satled sa To satisfie him with the Slae, His company we quite.” Then Dread and Danger grew so glad, And wont that they had wun; They thought all seald that they had said, Sen they had first begun. They thought then, they mought then Without a partie plead; But yet there, with Wit there, They were dung downe indeed. 89 “Sirs, Dread and Danger,” then quoth Wit, “Ye did yourselves to mee submit; Experience can prove.” “That,” quoth Experience, “I past: Their owne confession made them fast; They may no more remove. For, if I right remember mee, This maxime then they made, To wit: the man with Wit should wey What Philosophs had said. Which sentence, repentance Forbade him deare to buy; They knew then how true then, And preasde not to reply.” 90 Though hee dang Dread and Danger down, Yet Courage could not [be] overcome, Hope heght him such an hyre: He thought himselfe, so soone he saw His enemies were laid so law, It was no time to tyre. Hee hit the yron while it was hait, Incace it might grow cold; For he esteemde his foes defaite, When once he found them folde. “Though we now,” quoth hee now, “Have beene so free and franke, Vnsought yet, ye mought yet For kindnesse cund us thanke. 91 “Suppose it so as thou hast said, That unrequyrde wee offered aide, At least it came of love. Experience, yee start too soone, Yee dow nothing while all be done; And then perhaps yee prove More plaine than pleasant, too, perchance: Some tell that have you tryit; As fast as you your selfe advance, Ye dow not wel deny it. Abide then your tide then, And waite upon the wind; Ye know, sir, ye ow, sir, To hold you ay behinde. 92 “When yee have done some doughty deeds, Syne ye should see how all succeeds, To write them as they were.” “Friend, huly, haste not halfe so fast, Lest,” quoth Experience, “at last Ye buy my doctrine deare. Hope puts that haste into your head, Which boyles your barmie braine; Howbeit, Fooles haste comes hulie speede; Faire heights make fooles be faine. Such smyling, beguiling, Bids feare not for no freets; Yet I now deny now That al is gold that gleets. 93 “Suppose not silver all that shines: Oft times a tentlesse Merchant tines, For buying geare be gesse; For all the vantage and the winning Good buyers gets at the beginning.” Quoth Courage, “not the lesse, Whiles as good Merchant tines as wins, If old mens tales bee true. Suppose the pack come to [the] pins, Who can his chance eshew? Then, good sir, conclude, sir, Good buyers have done baith; Advance then, take chance then, As sundry good ships hath. 94 “Who wist what would bee cheape or deare Should neede to traffique but a yeare, If things to come were kend. Suppose all bygone things be plaine, Your Prophecy is but prophane; Ye're best behold the end. Yee would accuse mee of a crime Almost before wee met; Torment you not before the time, Since dolour payes no debt. What by past, that I past, Ye wot if it was well: To come yet, by doome yet, Confesse ye have no feele.” 95 “Yet,” quoth Experience, “what than? Who may be meetest for the man, Let us his answere have.” When they submitted them to mee, To Reason I was faine to flee, His counsell for to crave. Quoth he, “since you yourselves submit To doe as I decreet, I shal advise with Skil and Wit, What they thinke may bee meete.” They cryde then, “we byde then At Reason for refuge; Allow him, and trow him, As governour and iudge.” 96 So said they all, with one consent, “What he concluds, we are content His bidding to obey. Hee hath authority to use; Then take his chose whom he would chuse, And longer not delay.” Then Reason rose and was reioysde: Quoth he, “mine hearts, come hither; I hope this play may bee composde, That we may goe together. To all now I shall now His proper place assigne; That they heere shal say heere, They thinke none other thing.” 97 “Come on,” quoth he, “companion, Skill, Ye understand both good and ill, In Physick yee are fine; Be medciner unto this man, And shaw such cunning as yee can, To put him out of paine. First gard the ground of all his griefe, What sicknes ye suspect; Syne looke what hee lackes for reliefe, Ere further he infect. Comfort him, exhort him, Give him your good advice; And panse not, nor skanse not, The perill nor the price. 98 “Though it be cumbersome, what recke? Finde out the cause by the effect And working of his veines. Yet while we grip it to the ground, See first what fashion may bee found To pacifie his paines. Doe what ye dow to have him haile, And for that purpose prease: Cut off the cause, the effect must faile, So all his sorrowes cease. His fever shall never From thencefoorth have no force; Then urge him to purge him, He will not waxe the worse.” 99 Quoth Skil: “his senses are so sicke, I know no liquor worth a leeke To quench his deadly drouth; Except the Cherrie help his heat, Whose sappy sloking, sharp and sweet, Might melt into his mouth, And his melancholy remove, To mitigate his minde. None wholesomer for your behove, Nor more cooling of kinde; No Nectar directar Could all the gods him give, Nor send him, to mend him, None like it, I believe. 100 “For drowth decayes as it digests.” “Why, then,” quoth Reason, “nothing rests But how it may bee had?” “Most true,” quoth Skil, “that is the scope, Yet we must have some helpe of Hope.” Quoth Danger, “I am rad His hastines breeds us mishap, When he is highly horst: I would wee looked ere wee lap.” Quoth Wit, “that were not worst. I meane now, conveene now The counsell one and all; Begin then, cal on then:” Quoth Reason, “so I shall.” 101 Then Reason rose with gesture grave, Belyve conveening all the lave, To see what they would say; With silver scepter in his hand, As Chiftane chosen to command, And they bent to obey. He pansed long before he spake, And in a study stood; Syne hee began and silence brake: “Come on,” quoth he, “conclude What way now we may now Yon Cherrie come to catch; Speak out, sirs, about, sirs; Have done—let us dispatch.” 102 Quoth Courage, “scourge him first that skars; Much musing memory but marres; I tell you mine intent.” Quoth Wit, “who will not partly panse In perils, perishes perchance, Ov'r rackles may repent.” “Then,” quoth Experience, and spake, “Sir, I have seene them baith, In bairnlines and lye aback, Escape and come to skaith. But what now of that now? Sturt followes all extreames; Retaine then the meane then, The surest way it seemes. 103 “Where some hes further'd, some has faild; Where part hes perisht, part prevaild: Alike all cannot lucke. Then either venture, with the one, Or, with the other, let alone The Cherrie for to plucke.” Quoth Hope, “for feare folke must not fash.” Quoth Danger, “let not light.” Quoth Wit, “bee neither rude nor rash.” Quoth Reason, “yee have right.” The rest then, though[t] best then, When Reason said it so, That, roundly and soundly, They should together goe 104 To get the Cherrie in all haste, As for my safety serving maist. Though Dread and Danger feard The peril of that irksome way, Lest that thereby I should decay, Who then so weake appearde, Yet Hope and Courage hard beside, Who with them wont contend, Did take in hand us for to guide Vnto our iourneyes end; Impleadging, and waidging, Both two their lives for mine, Providing the guiding To them were granted syne. 105 Then Dread and Danger did appeale, Alledging it could not be well, Nor yet would they agree; But said they should sound their retreate, Because they thought them no wise meete Conductores unto mee, Nor to no man in mine estate, With sicknes sore opprest; For they tooke ay the nearest gate, Omitting oft the best. Their nearest perquearest Is alwayes to them both, Where they, sir, may say, sir, “What recks them of your skaith?” 106 “But as for us two, now we sweare By him, before whom we appeare, Our ful intent is now To have you whole, and alway was, That purpose for to bring to passe; So is not theirs, I trow.” Then Hope and Courage did attest The gods of both these parts, If they wrought not all for the best Of mee, with upright hearts. Our Chiftane than liftane His scepter, did enioyne “No more there uproare there!” And so their strife was done— 107 Rebuiking Dread and Danger sore, Suppose they meant well evermore To me, as they had sworne; Because their neighbours they abusde, In so farre as they had accusde Them, as ye heard beforne. “Did ye not else,” quoth he, “consent The Cherry for to pow?” Quoth Danger, “we are well content; But yet, the maner how? We shal now, even all now, Get this man with us there; It rest is, and best is, Your counsel shall declare.” 108 “Wel said,” quoth Hope and Courage, “now We thereto will accord with you, And shall abide by them; Like as before we did submit, So wee repeate the samine yet; We minde not to reclaime. Whom they shal chuse to guide the way, Wee shal him follow straight; And further this man, what we may, Because wee have so height; Promitting, but flitting, To doe the thing we can To please both, and ease both, This silly sickly man.” 109 When Reason heard this, “then,” quoth hee, “I see your chiefest stay to bee, That we have nam'd no guide; The worthy counsel hath, therefore, Thought good that Wit should goe before, For perils to provide.” Quoth Wit, “there is but one of three Which I shall to you show, Whereof the first two cannot bee, For any thing I know. The way heere so stay heere Is, that wee cannot clim Even ov'r now, we foure now: That will bee hard for him. 110 “The next, if we goe downe about While that this bend of Craiges run out, The streame is there so starke, And also passeth wading deepe, And broader farre than we dow leape, It should be idle work. It growes ay broader nere the sea, Sen over the lin it came; The running dead doth signifie The deepnes of the same. I leave now to deave now, How that it swiftly slides, As sleeping and creeping; But nature so provides. 111 “Our way then lyes about the Lin, Whereby, a warrand, we shal win, It is so straight and plaine; The water also is so shald, We shal it passe, even as we wald, With pleasure and but paine; For as we see the mischief grow Oft of a feckles thing, So likewise doth this river flow Foorth of a pretty spring; Whose throat, sir, I wot, sir, You may stop with your neive; As you, sir, I trow, sir, Experience, can prieve.” 112 “That,” quoth Experience, “I can; All that yee said sen yee began, I know to be of truth.” Quoth Skill, “the samine I approve.” Quoth Reason, “then let us remove, And sleepe no more in sleuth. Wit and Experience,” quoth he, “Shall come before apace; The man shall come, with Skill and mee, Into the second place. Attour now, you foure now Shall come into a band; Proceeding, and leading, Each other by the hand.” 113 As Reason ordeinde, all obeyde; None was ov'r rash, nor none affraide, Our counsel was so wise: As of our iourney Wit did note, We found it true in every iote: God bles'd our interprise. For even as wee came to the tree, Which, as yee heard mee tell, Could not be clum, there suddenly The fruite for ripnes fell. Which hasting and tasting, I found myselfe relievde Of cares all and sares all Which minde and body grievde. 114 Praise be to God, my Lord, therefore, Who did mine health to mee restore, Being so long time pinde; Yea, blessed bee his holy Name, Who did from death to life recleame Mee, who was so unkinde. All Nations also magnifie This everliving Lord; Let me with you, and you with mee, To laude him ay accord; Whose love ay wee prove ay To us above all things; And kisse him and blesse him Whose Glore eternall rings.

On ane thre headit hecate in haist þair they cryit: “As we have fund in this feild this fundlin forfarne, First, his faith he forsaikis, in the feynd to confyde, Be vertew of thir wordis &amp; of this raw ?arne, And thryse thre and threttie knottis on ane blew threed; And of deid menis memberis, weill schewit in ane schoe, Quhilk we have band from top and tae, Ewin of ane hundreth men and mae: Now grant ws, devillis, ere ve gae Our dewtie to doe. “Be þe moving of þe mone, mapamone, &amp; þe kingis ell, Be phlegitoun, the sevin starnis, and þe Chairlvane, Be the hicht of þe heavin, and lawnes of hell, Be all the brether of belliallis buird in ane band, Be the pollis, þe planeittis, and singis all tuell, Be þe michtis of þe moone—lat mirknes remane,— Be the elementis [all] that our craft can compell, Be the floodis Infernall, and fureis of pane, Be all the ghaistis of our gang, that dwellis þair doun, In signe of stikis, that stinking strand, And pluto, that our court command, Resave this harlot of our hand, In name of Mahoun. “That this worme, in our wark, sick wonder can wirk; And, throw poysoun of þis poyd, our practic prevaillis To cut of our cwmmer to cum to the kirk, For the half of our help I hauld heir is haill.

Of bliss let it be als bair as þe birk, That tittest þat taidrell may tell ane ill taill: Let no wo in þis warld to þis wrache be wantit.” Be they haid said, the fyre flauch flew; Bothe thunder, weit, and windis blew; Quhair be the cwming cummeris knew Thair asking wes grantit. Quhen þe cummeris that crab with pluto contractit, They promeist, as parentis, [syne,] for thair awin pairt, Ane mother of mischeif, an they micht mak it, Ane Imp of all ill most meit for þair airt. Nikniven, as nwrische, to teich it, gart tak it, To saill the see in a sive, bot compas or cairt; And milk of ane harin tedder, that wyfis suld be wrakit, And þe kow give ane choppin wes wont give a quart; That bairnis suld bane baith bloode &amp; banis, Quhen they haue neither milk nor meill; Compellit be hunger for to steill, Then sall they give him to the deill, Ofter nor anes. Fra the dames devoitlie haid done þair devoir, In having that hurchoun, they haistit þame hame, Of þat mater to mak amangis þame na moir, saifing, nixt, þat þe Nunes þat nirlend suld name. thay cowit ther [the] kytrell, the face of it bair, And nippit it so done neir, that to sie it wes schame; Syne callit it peild pollart, they peild it so sair. “Quhair we clip” quod þe cwmmeris, “it cummeris na kame, For we have [heght] to Mahoun for hansell his hair.” They maid it lyk a scrapit swyne; And ay as they pold it, they gart it quhryn, And schuif, as we may sie syne, The face of it bair. Be ane eftir midnicht, þair office they endit; for then it wes na tyme for trumpouris to tairie: sum bakvard on biches and broodsowis bend[it], that cruikit crokadeill [they] quyt with þame they carie. vnto þe cocatrice in ane creill they send it; quhair, sevin ?eiris, it sowkit, sweillit, singit and sarie, The [kin of it] be þe cry, incontinent kend it, feching fude for to feid it, from the feild of pharie. Ilk elph of þame all broch ane almond oisteris; Bot wes no dayntie dische; Ane foul phlegmatik fowsum fiche: Insteid of sawthe, on it they piche. Sic fude [feid] sick foisteris!

With mudgeounes, and murgeounis, and mowing þe bane, They leit it, they lift it, they loif it, they lak it, They graip it, they grip it; It greitis, they grane; They bind it, they baw it, they bed it, they brat it. It skitterit, it squeillit; they startit ilk ane, quhill þe ky in the cuntrie startillit and chaisit, quhilkis rairing ran rid wood, rowtand in a rane. þe wild deir in thair den þe din hes displasit.

In Argyle, with þe gate, he ?eid amange glennis, Ay vsing þe office þair of a beist, Quhill blistles wes banisit for handling þe hennis; Syne fordward to flanderis fast fleid or he ceist. from þe poore anis þe pultrie he plukit be þe pennis, Incressing In corpis; þe hart in his breist, And Curage, inclynit to knaverie, men kennis, To pestilent purpoisss planelie he preist. Bot trewlie, to tell þe trewth vnto ?ow, In nawayis wes he wyse; He vsis cairtis and dyce, And fled na kynd of vyce, Or few, as I trow. He was ane fals schismatik, notor[ious]lie namit; Baith hurdome, &amp; homeceid, vnsell he vsit; for schismes, and Symonie, þat smachart wes schameit; Pryde, Ire, and Invy, that vndoche abvsit. Of caching, and coweitting, bitterlie blameit; for baidrie, and bordaling, lukles he lufit; [Thrist], drynes, and drinking, that devill defamit; fals, fen?eit, and flytting with [flaterie] infusit; Maist sinfull and sensuall—schame to reherss! Quhais feckles fuilichnes, And beistlie brukilnes, Can na man, I ges, weill put in verss. Ane vairloche, ane woirwolf, ane wowbat of hair, Ane devill, and ane dragoun, ane doyld dromodarie; Ane counterfute cuistroun that clerkis dois not cair; Ane claverand cohubie that crakis of þe farie; Quhois favourles phisnome dois dewlie declair His vyces and viceousnes. thocht I wald warie, Arcandam astrologia, a lanterne of lair, Affirmis his bleiritnes, to wisdome contrair, betaikning bothe bobbing and beldnes in aig, Greit fraud, and fals dissait, Capping with coyd conceat; witnesss sum verss he wreit, Half in a rage. Ane Anagrame, also, concerning that race, Suirlie sayis, it is a signe of a licherous lowne. His pailnes mixt pairtlie with broun in the face, Arcandam ascryvis to baibling ay boun, And tratling Intemperat, tymeles but place; Ane cowart, ?it cholerik, and drunk in ilk toune. And als his asss earis, an signe in schort space, That frenatik fuil sall grow mad lyk mahoun, Bot ?it sall he live lang, allace, quhilk wer loss; for sick ane traitling tratour, And baibling blasphimatour, wes nevir formit of natour— Sua gukit ane guise.

Finis MISCELLANEOUS POEMS (FROM THE LAING MANUSCRIPT) I. [LUIF STILL IN HOPE WITH PACIENCE.] Luif still in hope with pacience, My gentill hairt, for all thy woo. Quhy ar[t] thow euer so [in] suspence? Quhy threat ?e in ?our body so? Quhy is all plesure past ?e fro? Quhy art thow so dismaid but sence? Quhy art thow to thy self sic fo? Luif still in hope with pacience. Althocht I leive in mirthles mone, Half mingled with melancolie, Wald god þe day sall come anone, That þow thy awin desyre sall sie; Althocht it cum nocht instantlie, As ?e wald wiss with diligence, ?it on na wayis ?e weirie be, Bot luif in hope with pacience. In Luifis court quha listis to duell, At euerye schoure þai may nocht schrink, Bot oft man suffer stormes fell, And of þe well of dolour drink; No thing can gar þame wray nor wrink, No thing can do to thame offence, Bot pacientlie that thay will think, To luif in hope with pacience. Hope is þe onlie meit remeid, For þame þat lyis in memorie; Hope causis captivis demit to deid, In presoun strang richt blyith to be; Hope causis men in rageing see, To sowme thocht þai sie no defence: Hope causss luifaris, verrilie, To luif in hope with pacience. Hope causit Jacob fourtene ?eiris In bondage bass for to remane; Hope causit atrides and his feiris In Troy ten ?eiris to fecht full fane; Houpe causit penelopie to refrane Lang tuentie ?eiris in obseruance: Hope causit luifaris to constrane, And luif in hope with pacience. My Ladyis hert is nocht of Stone, I watt sche will nocht sie me die; I watt sche is nocht sic ane one As, god forbid, se crueltie. Hir gentilnes assuris me My service sche will recompance, Assuring hir that quhill I die, To luif in hope with pacience. O peirles peirle of pulchritude! O cheif charbucle of chaistitie! O deaisie deir! O rubie rude! The fairest flour of feminie. O plicht-anker of constancie! Eccept my seruice but offence, Assuring ?ow þat quhill I die, To luif in hope with pacience. Finis. II. [SUEIT HAIRT, REIOS IN MYND.] Sueit hairt, reioss in mynd, With conforte day and nicht, ?e haue ane luif as kynd As euer luifit weicht; Thocht I be out of sicht, Latt nocht ?our courage fall, My Joyfull hert and licht, ?e haif and euer sal. My bony burde, be blyith, And ?e sall find me so Imprent to ?ow, I kyith, To latt ?ow nocht be woo; Quhaireuer I ryde or go, ?e sall nocht sorie be, My leill luif, hert, and Ioo, Nane hes my hairt bot ?e. And ?ie, my trew luif sueit, This do ?e nocht gang stand, My blyithnes for to beit, As I serve at ?our hand; To think me nocht constand, My bony burd, lat be: My constant hairt sall stand To ?ow quhill þat I die. I bid no mair of ?ow, But god grant ?ow his bliss: God be als blyith of ?ow, As I wald be of þis, ?our lillie lippis to kiss, Thinkand þat mynd of ?ouris, My awin trew luif sche is, That luifis hir paramouris. Finis quod nescio. III. [WO WORTH THE FALL OF FORTOUNIS QUHEILL.] Wo worth the fall of fourtounis quheill, That was so cheangeabile vnto me! Than, quhen I thocht me sure and weill, Thow threw me down rycht suddanlie; Syne causit all my pleasures be Turnit in dolour day and nicht, For absence of hir fair bewitie, Quha onlie hes my hairtis licht. Schir Troyalus was nocht opprest With sic lamentabill peirsit payne For Cresceidis luif, quhome he luifit best, Wald into troy turne nocht agane; Bot ?it, sueit hairt, I mak ?ow plane Of þis oure pairting so suddanlie, I may nocht langer þis remane, Sen all my pleasure is gone from me. I am into dispair, allace! Agane I will ?ow newer sie, Remane or hant into þe place Quhair I may beir ?ow company; Bot ?it, sueit hairt, I testifie, My constant hairt sall nocht remove, Albeit ?e haue fra me absent be, Quha onlie hes my hairtis love. Finis quod nescio. IV. [PREPOTENT PALME IMPERIALL.] Prepotent palme Imperiall, Of perfyte pulchritude preclair! O lusume Lamp Etheriall, Quhais beamis bricht hes no compair! ?our angell face, fragrant and fair, Hes me bereft of my puir hairt, Quhais perfytnes I will declair, Gif ?e wald tak it in gude pairt. My witt of knawlege is to faint, With barrane speich and barbour brane, My toung vnabile is to paint That constant lufe þat dois remane Within my hairt, with greif and payne, For laik of knawlege to furth schawe; Sens I can nocht þe same explane, O wald to god ?our grace wald knawe! O happie war the Rethoriciane, That with sueit wourdis wald lament it! Alss happie war the gude musiciane, Wald sett and caus it to be prentit; And in ?our graces hand present it, Sua that ?e wald reid and pervs it, To knaw so soir I am tormentit, So that my grosnes war excusit. The vehement wodnes of the wind, Or rageing of þe Roring sey, Nor cannownis with þair thundering din, Nor ?et in battels for to be, Throw force of armes thocht I suld die, War nocht so grevous to my hairt, As to schaw furth my mynde to þe, Or latt ?ow knaw my painfull pairt. For quhen I haue declairit at large My mynde to ?ow with diligence, And hes committit all þe charge To ?our wisdome and excellence, Or ?it to ?ow suld do offence, That I so bauldlie durst proceid, Than suld I tak in patience, Ilk day to die ane sindrie deid. Quhairfore I humele pray ?our grace, Latt my complaint cum peirss ?our eareis, Gif pitie in ?our hairt hes place, As be ?our pulchritude appeiris; Than suld I nocht, with fludis of teiris, Bevaill the day, nor weip þe nicht, Nor ?it be faischet with deidis feiris, Throw absence of ?our bewte bricht. Lyke as it is the li?airtis kynd, Of mannis face to pray hir fude, So nature still steris vp my mynd To wew ?our peirles pulchritude; Quhairfore schortlie to conclude, Lat clemencie in ?ow be schawin, And nocht of mercie so denude, As rigorouslie to slay ?our awin.

Suppois I be of simple clan, Of small degrie and michtie name, My father is ane welthe man, Howbeit he be of littill fame. To tell the treuth I think nocht schame: For sen I was compellit to flie, I durst nocht duell with freindis at hame, For feir that folkis suld raveis me. Quhat fairlie thocht I tuke þe flicht? I was persewit with lad and loun: Rycht quyetlie into þe nicht, From the falkirk I maid me boun. My parentis may spair mony croun, Of gold and geir thay ar richt ryfe; Thairfor thay brocht me to þis toun, Heir for to be ane burges wyfe. It is nocht lang sen he begane, My fatheris hous for to frequent: Thay bad me tak ane mercheant man, Quhome with I was richt weill content.

My sinfull lyf dois still incress, My sorrow is þe mor; Frome wiketnes I can nocht ceiss, Wo is my hairtt þairfor. Som tyme quhen I think to do wiell And serue god nicht and day, My wiecket natur dois rebell, And leidis me astray. As bonnd and capteue wnto sin, Quhilk grewis me full soire, This miserie I do liue In; Wo is my hairtt þairfor. In deid sumtyme I do repent, And pardon dois obtene; bott ?itt, alace, Incontenentt, I fall to sin agane. My corrup nature is so ill, Offending mor and more, That I offend my lord god still; Wo is my hairtt þairfor. Wo is my hairt, wo is my mynd, Wo is my saull and spritt, That to my lord I am vnkynd, In quhome I suld delytt. Hes lowe alwayis I suld regerd, Quhilk towarttis me was so peure; bott I with sin do him reward, Most vnkynd creature, The best, þe bird, þe fiche, þe fowll, Thair maker do obeay; Bott I, þatt am ane leiffing saull, Am far much worss þan þai. For þai, according to þair kynd, To serue him do nocht ceass; Bott I, with sinffull hairtt and mynd, Do daylie him displeiss. Thes do I sore complene of sine, And withe king david weip, For I do ffeill my hairt within, The wairthe of god full deip. To hevene my eyis I dar nocht lift, Aganest it I hawe trespast; Nor In þe eirthe I find no scheift, Nor succoure þat can lest. Quhat sell I do? sell I dispair, And frome my saweoure slyd? Nay, god forbid, þair is na feir, Sen chrest for me hes deid. God became man and for ws men, He died and rais again; Hes merci greitt, we may se þan, For ever dois remane. Thairfoir my sinns will I confess, To god and mur[n]ing mak, Quha will forgeif þe same dowttles, For his sonne Chrystis saik. If sin In me god suld respect, Than do I knaw full will, hes Justice wald me sone rewers To þe deip pitt of hell. His glorius eyis can nocht abayd the full and fillthe smuk, quhairwith I am, on everie said, Coweritt as with ane Clok. Bott he in Chryst dois me behald, In quhome he dois delytt; And myn offences manifold, throw him releiffitt quytt. Reputting me amang the Just, Forgeifing all my sun, Thairfor my faithe, my houp, my trest, Sell ever be In hem. O Lord, Incress trew faithe In me, Thy guid spritt to me geif, Thatt I my grow in lowe to the, And evir seik to leiff In trew obedience of þai will, And thankfullnes of hairtt; And with þai graice so gaid me still, Thatt [I] my newir depairtt Frome thy trew[th], lord, and testement, all þe dayis of my lyff; nor frome þai Churche most Innocentt, thy awin trew spous &amp; wyf. Bott frome þatt fillthie hour of rome, Lord keip me ever more, as gratiouslie as þow hes done, thankis be to þe þairfor. And sen thow hes of gudnes, Forgevine all my sine, Strenthe me þai trewthe for to confess, And boldlie die þairin. Thatt as I hawe confessitt þe, Befor þe wickitt sortt, Thow may in þai guid tyme knaw me, to my Joy &amp; confortt. My Saull, returne vnto þai rest, Thow artt will satisfeitt; The lord hes grantit þai requist, And nothing þe denayitt. Prais be to god, þe Faþer of micht, praiss be to þe, o Cryst, praiss be to þe, Helie gost, Thre in on most heist. Finis. XXX. [PECCAUI PATER, MESERERE MEI.] Peccaui pater, meserere mei, I am nocht worthie to be callit thy chyld, quha stubburnelie hes went so lang astray, nocht lyk the sone, but lyk the prodigall wyld. my sillie saull with synnis is sa defylit, That sathan seikis to cache it as a prey. god grant me grace that he may be begylit: Peccaui, pater, meserere mei. I am abaysed how I dar be sa bauld, Befoir thy godlie presens till appeir; Or ha?aret anis the heavinis for to behauld, Quha am nocht wourdie that þe earth suld beir. ?it damne me nocht, quhome thow hes bocht so deir; Sed saluum me fac, dulcis fili dei, For out of luke þis leasing now I leir, Peccaui, pater, miserere mei. Gif thow, o lord, with rigour wald reuenge, quhat flesche befoir þe fatles suld be fund? Or quho is he quhais conscience culd him clenge, Bot by his brother is to sathan bund? ?it, of thy grace, thow tuke away þat ground, And send thy sone our penulties to pay, To saif ws from þe hideous, hellische hund: Peccaui, pater, miserere mei. I houpe for mercie, thocht my sinnis be hudge: I grant my guilt, and gronis to þe for grace. Thocht I wald flie, quhair suld I find refuge? Till heavin? o lord, þair is thy duelling place: The earth, thy futestule, ?ea, in hels palace, doun with þe deid; bot all most þe obey. Thairfoir I cry, quhill I haif tyme and space, Peccaui, pater, miserere mei. O gracious god, my guiltines forgeve, In sinneris deith sen thow dois nocht delyte, Bot rather þat þai suld convert and leive as witnes for thy sacret holy wryte. I pray the, thanne, thy promeis to perfyte With me, and I sall with þe psalmes say, To pen thy prais, and wondrous workis Indyte, Peccaui, pater, miserere mei. Suppois I sled, lat me nocht sleip in sleuth, In stinkand sty with sathanis sinfull suyne; Bot mak my tung þe trumpett of thy treuth, And len my verse sic vingis as ar devyne. Sen þow hes grantit me so gude ingyne To luif þe, Lord, in galland style and gay, Lat me no moir so trim ane talent tyne: Peccaui, pater, miserere mei. Thy spreit, my spreit to speik, with speid, inspyr. Holp, holie ghost! and be mongomries muse; flie doun on me in forkit tungis of fyre, as þow did on thyne awin apostles vse; And with thy fyre me ferventlie infuse To luif þe, lord, and langer nocht delay. My former folische fictionis I refuis: Peccaui, pater, miserere mei. Stoup, stubborne stomak, þat hes bene so stout; Stoup, filthy flesche, careou? of clay; Stoup, hardned hairt, before þe lord, and lout; Stoup, stoup in tyme, defer nocht day by day. Thow watt not [weill] quhen thou man pas away; [The tempter, als, is bissie to betrey.] Confess thy synnis, and schame nocht for to say, Peccaui, pater, miserere mei. To gryte Iehova salt all glore be givn, Quha schwpe my saull to his similitude; And to his sone, quhome he send doun from heavin, quhen I was lost, to by me with his blude; And to þe holy ghost, my gyder gude, Quho mot confirm my fayth to tak na fray, In me cor mundum crea—I conclude: Peccaui, pater, miserere mei. XXXI. [O LORD, MY GOD, TO ÞE I CRAY, HEIR MY COMPLENT.] O Lord, my god, to þe I cray, heir my complent, With sinnis so sair opprest am I that I wax fantt; My hairt is wexit Inwartlie with pane &amp; greif, That I am forst to cum to þe to seik releif, Confessing all my sinfullnes in thy presence, beseiking þe to grant me grace for my offence. my sinnis hes so provokit thyne Ire, þat I, allace! Deserwitt hes þe hellis fyr for my trespass. ?itt, Lord, to the I call and cray with hairtt Intreit: Thy word dois say nocht anis at all thow hes delytt In sinneris deithe, bott wald þat þai suld turne; quhilk promiss, lord, keip wnto me þat sair dois murne. If þat þow, lord, did call to mynd our sinis ilkane, than Iustifeit of adame kynd þair sell be nane. Except þow of [thy] fre merce saf ws frome deid, We ar all damnett eternalie withoutt remeid. Sen nan can throu his awin desertis be maid perfyt, we þe beseik into our hairt, grant ws þai spreitt; For nan can come to þe excep þat þow him draw, As chryst vnto his awin electt dois planlie schaw; Bott latt thy spritt with ws remane we þe exhort, In all our anguishe, greif, &amp; pane; and for þai names saik defend þai flok ilk ane, dispersit to þe warldis end, &amp; bring thame hame Into thay fald, þat now is wyd scatteritt abrod: be þow þair protectour, and gaid, þair lord, þair god. thow artt our heid, and over þai scheip, &amp; ever sell thay faithfull folk defend, &amp; peik frome pittis all; evin as þow keipit þai serwand noy þe ark within, quhen þow did all þe warld distroy for adame sine; and sauitt lott, quhen, In thayne air, þow did reproue Sodom, with furius flames of fyre frome hevine abou[e.] Thow brocht Iserall throw þe reid sie, baith saif &amp; sund; and pharaoh, with his gritt armie, þairin þow drownde; and Ionas, in þe quhellis bellie, þow safit thre dayis, syne send him into neniwe to preiche þai wayis.

And furiouslie, into his yre, thir cheldrene thre he cast into ane flame of fyre, þair bruntt to be; bott thy angell withe þame abod þe fyre to suaige, þat hurtt was no hair of þair heid for all his raig. þow did, o lord, defend and keip Susana frome Iudges fals, quhilk did pretend to wirk hir schame; And daniell in þe lyouns dene þow did preserue: Sic is þai fawore to all þame þat do þe sserue. Amangis þir exemplis all, we may imbring, How thow preserwit Dauid frome saull, and maid him king; And efter þat, of presone strang þow did relewe paull þe sulderis frome amang, þat none him greif. quhatt mister I to multiplie exampellis awld? thair restis an wark of þai merci ?itt to behald, of Iames the sext, our nobill king, quhome chryst mocht keip With Dauid, thow did him for to bring of dangeris deip. Quhen þat hes fois begud to fane and him persew, Achitophell and absalon thow þan overthrew; And þow did dullfulie doun ding þame, did þhame deir: Chryst, grantt him lang over ws to ring in þai trew feir. Nott onlie dois þow [þame] defend frome perelis gritt, bott als oft [als] þai do offend, þow dois remeitt thair sinnis ilk ane, and dois nocht lay þame to þair chairg, As in þe scriptur fund we may the same at large. Now sen þat þow hes heirtofor þai sseruantis sawitt, and sufferitt nane to be forlone, þat mercy crawitt, with petie than behald my greif, my pane, &amp; smartt, and for þai names saik releif my troublitt hairtt. The sowme of all þat I wald haue is þai merci, The quhilk for chrystis saik I craue of þe onlie, Forgeif me, quhen I haue offenditt, &amp; finalie bring me, quhen þat my lyf is enditt, to glore with þe. Finis. XXXII. [O LORD, MY GOD, SEN I AM BROCHT TO GREITT DISTRES.] O LORD, my god, sen I am brocht to greitt distres, and In my bodie þair is nocht bott hewenes, mak haist In tyme to succur me, o richteous Iudge, sene I haue nane In eirth bott þe for my refuge. My onlie hoip and confidence In þe is sett, assuring me þatt myne offence sell be for?itt, And all my tormenttis sell tak end with suddan speid, quhen þow sick confortt sell me send as I haue neid. Lord, strenthen me with patience to suffer ay quhatt pleasis best þai excellence on me to lay, and lett me nocht declyne att all In tyme of neid, bott ever more on þe to call for my remeid. help me to beir my burden, lord, for I am weik, and lett þai strenthe and cair accord, for þai name saik. assist me with þai holie spreitt, þat I may still, with constantt hairtt and houp repleitt, abaid þai will. At leist sum pairtt, I þe beseik, to suaige my pane; as thow artt loving, kynd, &amp; meik, þai wrathe refrane; Into thy iustice and iudgment deall nocht withe me, bott, sen þat I am panitent, grantt me mercie. Quhen strenthe and senses ar all gone, &amp; wordis faill, my hairtt and mynd in þe alone sell be all heill. þai promess, nor tender love, na tyme, nor tyd, butt of my hairtt will I remoue, nor ?itt lett slyd. If þat þai pleasur be, þat I sell now depairtt, I recommend my saull to þe with thankfull hairtt; quhen it sell hawe ane duelling plaice with angellis hie, to ring in hevenlie Ioy and peice perpetualie. If þatt þai pleasure be my lyf to spair, releif me of my miserie and presentt cair, remeid me þat am lyk to mange, and sor opprest, And [I] will sing þai praiss as lang as I my lest. Finis. XXXIII. [QUHA SO DOIS PUT ÞAIR CONFIDENCE.] Quha so dois put þair confidence, and treistis in me with trew accord, to thame I sell be ane defence, In tyme of neid (thus sayis þe lord) If þai stand stiflie be my word, Frome dangeris gritt þai selbe frei; thocht weickit perische be þe suord, to myne ane bukler will I be. Thocht Pharoth with his gritt armie, Israell to kill he did Intend, I led þame saiflie throw þe sea, And from his bost did þame defend, quhair he maid ane mischeifus end, baith he and all hes compannay; Thairfor to all I mak itt kend, to myne ane bukler will I be. Thocht I did all þe warld distroy, becaus þe wickit wald nocht mend, ?itt sawitt I my sarwantt Noy, And frome þe flud did him defend; quhair Sodem maid ane weickit end, I sawitt lot, as ?e may sie: To weickitt thocht greitt plaigis I send, to myne ane bukler will I be. Thocht wickit saull, and absalon, Dauid his kingdom wald haue rentt, ?itt causit I him to ring abone, And did þame plege with punischement. For Saull by his awin suord wes schent, And absalom was hangitt hie; Be þis is richt euident, to myn ane bukler will I be. Becaus wickitt Iesabill, þe quene, Eleas blod scho snair to spill, On hir gritt sorrow þir was sene; ?itt him I sawitt frome her Ill. For hors ran over hir at þair will, Doggis knew hir baneis assuretlie: Thocht wickitt wald my sarwandis kill, To myne ane bukler will I be. Thocht wickitt haman gartt vp sett Ane pair of gallows, lairg and lang, Belewene surelie for to gett Mordecai thairon to hang; ?itt I red him out of þat thrang; Haman þairon was hangit hie: quhair ever myne dois ryd or gang, to myne ane bukler will I be. Quhen Dan[i]ell wes overthrawin, in presoun deip with lyonnes strang, To him they did no thing bot fane, And lickit him with tungis sa lang; Bot quhen his fais come þame amang, they did þame ryis dispytfulie: Thocht myne sumtyme dois suffer wrang, to þame a bukler will I be. Quhen susanna was In point of deid, to me scho did boithe cray &amp; call, and me bethocht to mak remeid, and I did heir hir by and by. That þatt accusitt hir wranguslie, ane schamefull deid I gartt þame die: Thocht my sarwandis In danger lay, To þame ane bukleir will I be. Now ?e þat ar myne cheldrene deir, and be with me enteritt in band, ?e knaw full oft ?e stuid in feir of tensall baith of lyf and land; For quhen grett king did ?ow gainstand, and als ?our preistis þat ar so hie, As þen I sawitt ?ow fra þair hand, Sa will I ?itt ?our bukler be. ?e knaw they thocht ?ow to distroy, quhairfor þai sett þai men of weir, thinken þairwith ?ow to annoy, and daylie to ?ow do grett deir; Bott ?itt to feicht I did ?ow leir, and I gaue ?ow þe wictorie; As þan I did ?our baner beir, Sa will I ?itt ?our bukleir be. Sen I frome boundage maid ?ow frie, And outt of egypt did ?ow call, Thair wickitt lawes se ?e latt be— to þame attend na thing at all. And be not lyk þe doge þatt sell His womett lik maist schamfulie, Do ?ow so, plaiges sall on ?ow fall, And I sall nott ?our buckler be. And thocht I hawe begone to serue, according to þe law ?e sett, Fra ?e begin and for to sweirue, ?our richteuousnes sell be for?ett. Than I in haist, bott ony latt, Sall plaige ?ow for Inequitie, Besyd þe plaig, þat ?e sell gett, I sall no mor ?our buckleir be. Howbeit the wickitt did mak lawis for to suppress my word of licht, Compelling myne be greitt ouerthrawis, the sam obey be þair gritt mycht. Now sa far as they ar not rycht, bot saweris of Idolatrie, Do þame ganstand, both day and nicht, And ay ?our buckler will I be. Thocht nabucadonosor king cast sidrach and abendnago, And mesach als, into þe fyre, becaus on na wayis þai wald go Worschip the Imag he maid tho, bott prayitt to me richt ardentlie; And I did saife þame frome þair fo: Lyk wayis ?our bukler will I be. Thocht I the wickit tholl ?ow kill, and violent deith do ?ow deuoir, This promess sure I mak ?ow till, Ane better lyf I sell restoir To ?ow, quhair þat ?e sell In glore Ay ring withe me continulie; quhair ?e sell dwell for evermore; quhair I sell ay ?our bukleir be.

[HARKEN, HERKENE, ME THINK ANE TROMPETT DOIS STUND.] Harken, herkene, me think ane trompett dois stund, blawing ane dreidfull blast; aryss, ?e deid, outt of þe grund, cum to ?our Judgmenntt Last. The king of kingis, and god most hie, sall mak þis blast to blaw; for he sell cum In maistir[ie], to Judge boithe hie and law. Ten hundreth thousand angellis bricht, appostellis, and prophettis, His marteris all in oppin sicht, Sell sit In Judgment sett, For to beir witness, schairp and schor, aganis þe wickit trane, quhome cryst sell dame for ever more wnto eternall pane. For god, dowtles, most neidis be Just, and thocht it seames lang, ane compt of all men tak he must, of all þair evell and wrang. Quhat evere man befor hes done, In secreitt or In sicht, In presence of þat feirfull throne, It selbe brocht to licht. Bott sowme will say, I wein, and lauche goddis word to scorn: “the warld is now as it hes bene, sene mankynd first was borne. “Thairfoir it is vncredabill, thatt chryst sould come sa sone; It is also wnpossibille, this warld suld be vndone. “Thir thingis ar feynit of subtill men, as thingis to mak ws feir: Come, lett ws tak oure pleseure than, as lang as we be heir.” To this sanct peter ansuoris, contrary þair desyre, that bothe þe heven, and eik þe arthe, ar keip in stor for fyre, Unto þe day of last iudgment, and of perditioune, quhair with þe vngodlie selbe brunt, with greitt distructioun. Our god, quhilk promisit to come, his promess will nocht beir; quhairfor he will not tary lang, his coming is not far. Ane day is had as muche with him, as we ane thowsand ?eiris; Agane ane thousand ?eiris with him, bott as ane day appeiris. Not onlie peter wryttis so, that this day is at hand; bot we haue ressonis money mo, as ?e sell vndirstand. Our maister, Cryst, himsellff dois say, Sa dois þe apposellis all, that þis same last &amp; dreidfull day, Lyk to ane theif cum sell. Quhen þai sell wein þat all is will, In peice and quyit rest, euen than sell fall distrouctioun fell, quhen þai think on it less. Thai bocht and sauld befor þe fluid, thy drank and spairit na coist, thy tuik þair lust, as þai wor wod, and suddenlie wer lost. Sa sell þai do befor the dome, as chryst dois plainlie say; we sie the lyk to pas is come, quhy doutt we of þis day? Sanct Iames did beir the Iewis in hand, now money ?eiris befor, that Chryst, þe Iudge, did present stand, and knokit at þe dure. In his appocalipss, sant Ihone, dois planlie testifie, that chryst sayis [in] his awin persone, “behald, I come schortlie.” Sant peter wrett ane vþair quhair, and I beleif it trew: The finell end of all is neir, and schortlie will Insew. If they did think þe end at hand, sa mony ?eiris ago, muche moir aucht we to vnderstand, thair be not money mo. This by þe scripturis evident, it planlie dois appeir: now proue we sell by argument, þat this same day drawis neir. All thingis þatt be vnder þe sonne, manis saull exceptit plane, Lykwyse as they [did] anis begune, sa sell thay end againe. The fyre with heitt, and rege ferwent, Dois sor consume and burne, As sur and sertene argument, That all to it sell turne. Quhat so dois waist in evere pairt, the haill most neidis decay: the warld dois waist in evere airthe, quhairfor it most away. The sune, þe mone, þe starnis so fair and all þat hevenlie host, the wateris, and þe mowing air, Sum of þair strenthe heve lost. The erthe of auld gaue heir encress, without tillage or pane; bott now hir strenthe is les and les, and les þe workmanis gane. Now herbes haue lost thair auncient strenthe, that they did hawe beforn; Thais do laik thair breid and lenthe, and smaller is þe corn. The bodie[s] of all beistis grow les then they hawe bene before; thairby may ?e planlie ges, thair kynd is feblit soir. We hawe hard tell of gyanttis fell, that wer in elder tyme; bot now we be lyk emmettis small, if we compair to þame. Euerie thing quhen it is new, then it is fresche and fair; bott ?eitt we find this resoun trew, it waxis auld and bair. Religioun trew was anis ferwent, bott now we see it cauld; that is ane certene argument, this warld is faint and auld. Bott quhat so ever waxis auld, it wenischis away; thairfor by resone manifald, this warld must neidis decay. Quhen nott on dall, nor ?itt on hill, ?e sie þe sune do stand, na langer dowtt, I think, ?e will, that nicht is neir at hand. So quhen no wertew wsit is, in greitt, nor ?ett in small, than may we trewlie trust to this, the warld sell hawe ane fall. Quhen naturall hert dois man forsaik, and wynature dois abound, It cawsis him with fefeir quaik, and dois his lyf confound. [So] quhen þe lowe to god is small, and self lowe dois exceid, then certenlie some plaige mortall, sone efter lett ws dreid. Now luf to god is out of land, and sellff luf waxis strange; quhairfor þe warld most ceass to stand, I think, or it be lang. Quhen daithe drawis nereist man vnto, thy raig in þair mad moid; thy hawe no skyll to say or do, bott feir as þai war wode. Before þe end of all lykwayss, salbe in quyet rest; Now Antechryst dois stile deuyss the godle to molest. Bott let þat beist still rage and roir, and kill by sea and land, feir not, ?e folk of Chryst, thairfor, for ?our iudge is at hand. He will ?ow tak to heven full hie, and raiss ?ow frome þe ground: Prepair ?ow then to heir, schortlie, this ioyfull trompit sound. Our King is Iames, þe we pray, Lord, saif him with þai grace; Keip all his subiectis in gud stay, and all his foes defece. Come, Lord, come quicklie, we þe pray, and tak ws wp on hie, that we may sing [in bliss] for ay eternall praiss to the. Finis. XXXV.

I hawe assurance of þai spreitt, that þow þe laidneitt will releif, quhilk cumis to þe with hairtt contreitt, and in þi bontie dois beleif. my feibill faith, o lord, revieue, for thocht my sinis be lyk þe sand, ?it þow art habill to forgif, and raiss me with þai helping hand. Quha can onfen?eitlie repentt? quha can frome wickeitnes abstene vnles þai grace be to þame lentt, to sich &amp; sob with weiping ene? þe prayer profeittis nocht ane prene, except þe same from faith proceid: Latt faithe and graice In me grow grene, that I may turne to þe In neid. Lord, with my sellff I am disspleisitt, and weirreis of þis burdene fasst; thay wreyth, þairfor, let be appeisitt: for?ett my full offen[c]is past.
