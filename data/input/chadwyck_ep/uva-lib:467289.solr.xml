      <field name="fulltext">The First Stone ON READING THE UNPUBLISHED PORTIONS OF OSCAR WILDE'S âDE PROFUNDIS.â Thou, The complete mountebank, The scented posturer, The flabby Pharisee, The King of Life, The Lord of Language With the bad teeth; The whining convict And Prince of Hypocrites, That slouchest Out of the shameless slime, Shamelessly To the prison penitent form, Licking pious chops, And saying texts For the pleasuring And sweet approval Of tract-distributors; Who hast wept and wept, And wept and wept and wept, Like a man; For whom there was nothing left But âabsolute Humilityâ And Love; And who withal might observe, Ever so airily, In the very act and motion Of delivering stab on stab With a dirty butcher's knife At the unguarded breast Of one who out of her pain Had trusted thee, âThere is something So exquisite About Christ!â Behold in dark places They light tapers for thy picture And range thee about With sorrowing angels; And gibe and gibber And make swift trips to Dieppe, When they think the police May call... In open daylight At the street corners Wherever five shillings net Is nimbly to be compassed We are to hear Squeaky accounts Of thine âartistry,â Thy âconsummateâ wit, Thy âintolerableâ griefs, Thy âheroicâ fortitude, Thy âdignifiedâ penitence, Thy Humility And Love; And they murmur âRequiescatâ! And âLet us draw a veilâ! And âWho shall cast the first stone?â... O, fleering Falseness, Though this my little stone Bar me from Mercy It is for thee. So, where thou lurkest Drenched in stale tears And very sorry for thyself, âIn the lowest mire Of Malebolge Between Gilles de Retz And the Marquis de Sadeâ (Of a verity Thou knewest thy destined place!) So, where thou lurkest Playing gracefully with ideas In the delicious Impudent Oxford manner (Albeit still damp With the aforesaid sour tears), Or nobly regretting âThe clear turtle soup, The luscious ortolans In crinkled Sicilian vine leaves, The wonderful pÃ¢tes Procured directly from Strasbourg, The Perrier Jouet, The Dagonet 1880, And the marvellous liqueur brandy Served always At the bottom Of great bell-shaped glasses,â Not to mention Certain fine feather-beds; Or steeping the gew-gaw pearl Of thy indecent soul In the elegant Brummagem cup Which thy schoolfellow with the brogue Rather put out of shape At the Central Criminal Court, Here's for thee! âDe mortuis!â thou shalt cry Who cried of old with rouged lips âLove,â and who wept every day âFor the same space of time,â âHalf an hour,â to wit, Because a critic of parts Clothed like a labouring man, Spat in thy tallowy face, Seeing what none had yet seen, Namely the Judas heart Wrapped in thy coward hide. Dost thou forget, O thou Of the fragrant April memories Who went down the primrose path To the thin sound of flutes, And down the Old Bailey stairs To the sound of unwashed hisses, Dost thou forget A bilious canting knave, The weeper for his own woes, Convict C 33, Who having meekly obeyed The excellent prison rules, And having omitted to cause The excellent prison staff A single moment's pain, Was given the use of ink? âBehold,â he cried, âa boon! I have ink to spill and spare, By Narcisse, I have ink! Now for a ravishing job Which will put the Devil to blush And teach the race of men To wince when you call them men... âThere was a friend of mine Gat in my tuft-hunting days When I was yet no more Than âthe Bohemian Wilde,â The apothecary's son, James Whistler's lickspittle, A foolish, middling poet, A âbusyâ journalist, And the puling lecturer On ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay Art: From October 10th to 13th Of 1894â (Think of the glittering soul Thus tragically seared With unimportant dates!) âMy dear young friend lay ill Of a terrible cold in the head. An influenza cold, At Brighton, in an hotel: I, the great and the good, Nursed and tended him, Not merely with luxuries Of fruit and flowers and books, But with fond solicitude And singular affection; I got âspecial grapes from London,â Invented things to please him And remained at his bedside To quiet and amuse him... Under my kindly care In a day or two, of course, He recovered, and âwent for drives.â Then I feel extremely ill, A terrible fever attacks me, I had caught my friend's influenza! Oh yes, I had, I had! And how did he treat me? Sweet Jove! Help me to cry my wrongs! It was not a question of grapes, Flowers and charming gifts, It was a question, alas! Of common necessities; I could not get the milk The Doctor had ordered me; Lemonadeâlemonade Was pronounced impossible, And when I begged my friend To purchase a book for me At a neighbouring bookseller's shop, He actually didn't! For this black treachery I reproached him in scathing terms And bade him leave the room; But, when I lifted my head From the downy pillow in which I had carefully buried it, Believe me or not, as you will, My friend was still thereâand he laughed, A brutal common laugh, Laughed at me, Oscar Wilde, Oscar O'Flahertie Wilde, The intensive genius, The Lord of Language and Life, The Symbol of my Ageâ Told me I drank too much And that I ought to eat less, And turned on his wicked heel! âBy Tuesday the fever had gone, And so âI dined downstairs.â (You may judge of the horrible state In which I had been, from the fact That the day before, I dined And also supped, upstairs!) Next day was Wednesday, my birthday. Epistles of congratulation Showered on me through the post, One of them, need I remark, Was a letter from my friend: Did he express his regret For the ugly scene he had caused? Oh dear me no! Did he say âMany happy returnsâ? Probably so; perhaps not; Any way there were parts Of this hideous letter of his Which flicked me on the raw, As Plato might have put it, Or Longinus possibly, Or Pliny, or Dante, or Bion, Or Aeschylus, if you will. Especially loathsome and foul Were my friend's concluding words Which, for his shame, I set down, âWhen you are not on your pedestal You are not interesting. The next time you are ill I will go away at onceâ! âAh! what coarseness of fibre Does that reveal. What entire Lack of imagination... How often have these words Come fearfully back to me In the wretched solitary cell Of the various prisons I have been sent to (sic). I have said them to myself Over and over again... For him to write thus to me When the very illness and fever From which I was suffering I had caught from tending him Was of course revolting In its coarseness and crudity; And for any human being In the whole wide world to write thus To another would be a sin For which there is no pardon; Were there any sin For which there is none. âBut let me keep Love in my heart, You, who outraged me thus, Let me keep love in my heart, Lest I falter and fail And lose the trick of tears Which we in prison must use Or feel unhappy all day; For love of you my friend, Out of sheer love, I indite Forty-six thousand words Of livid chattering rage, Hate and malice and spite: Let down with piety, Humility and tears, And I do this inasmuch As you who laughed at me Are happy and at large In Paris, at Naples, or Rome, In golden Sicily, Or where the Cyprian palms Climb from the sea to the sun; You have books and flowers and friends, Meat and drink of the best, Purple and fine linen, Money and all it can buy, You who have written naught But a few undergraduate poems; While I blubber here forlorn In a latrine called a cell, Clothed with the felon's garb, A common convict, a âlagâ Doing his bitter âstretchââ I whose engaging plays Beat Congreve for brilliancy, For philosophy, Dumas fils And I suppose Everybody else For every other quality; I, Oscar Wilde, lie prone 'Mid the wreck of my wonderful life; Crushed by anguish, Bewildered with terror, Dazed through pain, âMulta gemens;â With nothing before me but ink, And nothing inside me but Love! âGive me my Testament, My Christmas Greek Testament, Let me weep a bit more, Tears are the supreme virtue, Niobe must have known What we feel who are pent In the hideous prison house: Every morning of late After I polish my tins I read the Gospels in Greek; It is such a delightful way Of opening the day; Every one, my dear friend, Even in a turbulent life Should read the Greek Testament, It is like going into a garden Of lilies, my dear young friend, Out of some narrow, dark house. And, while I remember it, Does it occur to you That each rich dish you ate When you lunched or dined with me, Each glass of amber champagne You swallowed at Willis's Rooms Where you were often my guest, Cost me a lot of money? Of course, in the vulgar, low, Undistinguished, profane Circles in which you move Such a question would not Be considered quite good style; But think it over and try To discern what a beautiful thought This is, which I now propound In the simple Socratic form; When you lay aside your mask To get a little breath Which you surely must do sometimes, Try to perceive with pain That when a man of parts, A man of supreme parts, The symbol of his age, Asks another man to sup, The man of supreme parts Is expected to foot the bill: This is what Dante meant When he wrote âAbandon hope All ye who enter here,â That is to say âAll ye Who enter Willis's Rooms;â St. Francis of Assisi Had the same thought, And it runs Like a thread of purple and gold Through my âPicture of Dorian Grayâ And through my âSoul of Manâ And all my other works. Perhaps in after life It will dawn upon your slow And darkened intellect That a sorrow's crown of sorrow Is remembering what one paid For other people's lunches, As Tennyson somewhere says. Pray excuse me for a moment, I must a little indulge In the prisoner's prerogative Of tears. âThen againâ This will wound your vanity, But I want to wound it, And thus bring you In some way nearer To a proper appreciation Of the Oxford temperament And my own flawless Art, Which you never understood Or sufficiently admired; Has it occurred to you That while you go free and at large Happy and indolent In Paris, at Naples or Rome, Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, I the damp prisoner, The Democritus of the gaols, The Lord of Language and Life, The Symbol of my Age, Am really suffering My terrible, terrible sentence And public obloquy Because of my friendship for you? âYou start with horror. Ah! Look at yourself in the glass, The author of my disgrace, The ruin of my house. Out of my love, I say You and yours are to blame For all that has happened to me; Love you know is the first Secret of this sad world, Love is a Sacrament That one should take kneeling, my friend: And IâI love you. Ah yes I insist on loving you Whether you like it or not... As I was saying, the Law, Your stupid English law, Pretended to send me here Because of my infamies With certain unkempt clods: Swine, who nevertheless Being approached by me, The dainty âartist in life,â Were simply âAriels, Delightfully suggestive And most stimulating.â It is quite true that my life Has been foul with perversities, And that I more than deserve My terrible punishment; (He who will not admit this And realise it to the full Must never lay claim to the grace And honour of friendship with me.) I don't regret what I did, I merely explain it and weep, For where there is sorrow, my friend, There clearly is holy ground; But I say to myself every day âIf I had never met you, Never allowed you to force Your way into a life So big with wonder and joy, I could have gone my gait, My mellow, spicy gait, Undisturbed, unabashed, Unassailed, and unhurt. Flauntingly impudent, Grinningly callous, Puffed out with Saumur, And full of ortolans, Down to the day of my death.â âOf course, I don't blame you, Oh no, oh no, no, no; Though you will see what I mean. Besides, if it wasn't you Who was it? Your father prepared With a guileless carrot or so Thrown at âmy actors,â the trap, The idiot booby-trap, Which tangled up my feet And brought me from my fame To this damp infamy, Your fatherâI borrow a phrase From the poor thieves and rogues Who harbour with me hereâ Your father âdid me inâ; If you had never been born, He wouldn't have troubled himself, And if he had never been born And his father hadn't been born And his father hadn't, why then Your father, my dear young friend, Would not have interfered, And I (don't you see?) should be free It is equally true, of course, That if my father hadn't been born, I should not have been born And couldn't have come to grief; But that is scarcely the point, So we won't labour it; I wish to show you how love Helps us to grasp the truth, How âthe cassia and myrrh of tearsâ Shed copiously every hour Lift us out of the rut Of vulgar reasoning, And âcreeping common sense,â And put us on the heights Where we perceive great truths And learn to love and forgive.â Here, O ineffable Lord Of the cynical inky arts And the split infinitive, Here is the drift and gist Of thy forty-six thousand words Thy ouvrage de longue haleine And deft apologia, Thy congregation of hints, Whispers and monkey rage, Whereby thou wouldst âput thyself rightâ And the friend thou lovedst all wrong; This is the gracious yield Of the humble, contrite heart Writ magnificently On paper stamped âReading Gaol.â With the cheap prison ink, And given to trusty hands Not to burn but to hold. âWhen I am dead my dearest (And not till I am dead) Publish the pious parts, The holy parts about Love, And Pity and Kindness and Tears, So that I figure no more As the super-fatted goat With emeralds round his neck And stercoraceous hooves, Who tore the lilies down And scattered the young vines, But rather as the dove Brooding in innocent joy, Or the kindly pelican Who keepeth a bleeding breast For love of her young things; So that in obscure time I may be seen to belong Not to the smirking fops And sexless demireps Whose fleers made hideous The Cities of the Plain, But to the company Of the untroubled saints Whose sins though scarlet were washed Milk-white with fire and tears, And who, in that they became As little children, might walk In the green fields with Christ: As for my friend... the parts About my friend... I think... 'Twere well... on the whole, 'twere well: Furnish a secret drawer And keep themâfor my friend; And he will live me out And never dream, good fool, How we have trussed him up A-teaching of him love: But I shall know... and you. And when he diesâwhy then We take our chance of print!â O Treachery! O damned And furtive Plotter! Thou Of whom the filthiest fiend Might wish to wash his hands. By whom Iago pales Into a gentleman And Wainwright shines snow-white; If any echo or hail Of this world reaches thee Deep in thy lampless lair Harken! The dubious dust Hidden in PÃ¨re la Chaise Beneath the Epstein stone Is not thou; and that stone Is not thy monument, Nor for thy memory: But on a Rock called Shame Sunken in letters of lead Which may not be effaced Till the slow clocks of Time Shall strike the ages out, Men read:â OSCAR FINGAL O'FLAHERTIE WILLS WILDE WHOSE SOUL WAS ALL A SIN, WHOSE HEART WAS ALL A LUST, WHOSE BRAIN WAS ALL A LIE.</field>
