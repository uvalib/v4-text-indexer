      <field name="fulltext">MYRRH AND AMARANTH HERBAL Love-lies-bleeding now is found Grown in every common ground. Love-lies-bleeding thrives apace With the dear forget-me-not: Nor is boy's love out of place Now in any garden plot. Love-in-a-mist, bewilderÃ¨d With the many tears Love shed, Seeks for herb-o'-grace to bind Up her wounds, and fever-few To give ease to a hurt mind; Wound-wort is not wanting too. Now the love-lies-bleeding grows More than lily or the rose; Love-in-idleness has gone Out of fashion; here are flowers Heartsease for to rest upon With remembrance of sweet hours. Ladders-to-heaven may be found Now in any common ground. TELLING THE BEES (For Edward Tennant) Tell it to the bees, lest they Umbrage take and fly away, That the dearest boy is dead, Who went singing, blithe and dear, By the golden hives last year. Curly-head, ah, curly-head! Tell them that the summer's over, Over mignonette and clover; Oh, speak low and very low! Say that he was blithe and bonny, Good as gold and sweet as honey, All too late the roses blow! Say he will not come again, Not in any sun or rain, Heart's delight, ah, heart's delight! Tell them that the boy they knew Sleeps out under rain and dew In the night, ah, in the night! NO MAN'S LAND Not to an angel but a friend He turned at the day's bitter end. It was so comforting to feel Some one was near, to see him kneel By the deep shell-hole's edge: to know He was not left to the fierce foe. This soldier who had eased his head And staunched the flow where it had bled, Who made a pillow of his breast Where the poor tossing head might rest, Wore a young face he used to know Yesterday, some time, long ago. The night's cold it was bitter enough, But who shall keep the fierce Day off? And must he lie, be burnt and baked In the hot sands, with lips unslaked?â Will no one give him dews and rain? Lord, send the frozen night again! But here's the one who comforted! No angel, but a boy instead, Slender and young, above him leans: The sands are changed to tender greens; He hears the wind in the sycamore Sing a low song by his mother's door. Such tender touches to his wound, Such loving arms to clasp him round, Until they find him the third day! The stretcher-bearers heard him say, âDon't leave me, Denis! I am here.â Denis? But Denis died last year! He will maintain that Denis was Beside him in his bitter case, Denis more beautiful and gay Than in the dear, remembered day: God sent no angel, but a friend To save him at the bitter end. QUIET EYES The boys come home, come home from war, With quiet eyes for quiet thingsâ A child, a lamb, a flower, a star, A bird that softly sings. Young faces war-worn and deep-lined, The satin smoothness past recall; Yet out of sight is out of mind For the worst wrong of all. As nightmare dreams that pass with sleep, The horror and grief intolerable. The unremembering young eyes keep Their innocence. All is well! The worldling's eyes are dusty dim, The eyes of sin are weary and cold, The fighting boy brings home with him The unsullied eyes of old. The war has furrowed the young face. Oh, there's no all-heal, no wound-wort! The soul looks from its hidden place Unharmed, unflawed, unhurt. THE SHORT ROAD TO HEAVEN There's a short road to Heaven, but you must take it young, And if you're for long living the road is all as long; A long road, a hard road, with many a turn and twist. The longer you'll be travelling, the easier it's missed. But the wise lads, the dear lads, they've put it to the touch, The lads of sweet-and-twenty, and maybe not so much; 'Tis the green way they've taken in the spring of their year, When all their birds are singing to make them pleasant cheer. The long road is dusty and never a streamlet sings, The dust lies on the hedgerows and on the birdies' wings; The longer that you travel the wearier you are And the farther off is Heaven and the stars are far. But the wise lads, the dear lads, the pathway's dewy green, For the little Knights of Paradise of eighteen and nineteen; They run the road to Heaven, they are singing as they go, And the blood of their sacrifice has washed them white as snow. The young mothers' darlings, ah, who would bid them stay? The short road to Heaven's a green and pleasant way; They run singing and leaping, they will be in before The night darkens on themâand there's God at the door. A CONNAUGHT MAN (For Hugh Maguire) Lord, when he shall come home from war, Give him no pastures green, But a wet wind and a soft wind With reek of turf between. Nor let Thy light shine overmuch Lest that his soul should fret For the grey mist and silver mist That he will not forget. Build him no pearl-white palaces Nor gardens fair and fine, Lest for his bare, far-stretching bogs His home-sick heart should pine. Not groves, nor any vermeil walks, Nor flowery pastures pied, But the great sweep of sky and land And the hills at eventide. Lord, when the men come from the war, Give each man his desire! Give him the soft wind and the rain And the reek of the turf fire. THE BROTHERS (For Arnold and Donald Fletcher.) One called from Salonika and his call Rang to his brother; Forded wide rivers, climbed the mountain wall, Seeking the other. Are you asleep, Arnold, or do you wake? Our way's together! The day's before us and the path we take Over the heather. As oft before, breasting the Wicklow hills, Light-foot and leaping Over the bog-pools and the singing rills, Side by side keeping. We have known all the best that life can give, Tasted the sweetest; Shall we grow old, lag heavy-foot and grieve, We, who were fleetest? Let us be gone while yet it is the morn Dewy before us, Light on the mountains and the springing corn And the lark o'er us! The voice from Salonika found the way Easy of passage, And to French Flanders on the second day Carried the message. Arnold has gone the way that Donald went, Donald's o'ertaken; Up to the highest peaks they climb unspent, Footing the bracken. THE SECRET FOE When now to battle he shall ride, The bravest of the brave, Joan the Maid be by his side And Michael, quick to save. Not against man's most fell device The shell, the gas, the mine; These he shall meet with steady eyes And courage half-divine. Oh, not the gaping wounds and red And not the tortured sense, And not the dying and the dead And his own impotence. But when the joy of battle faints And his hot blood grows chill, Be near him, all ye soldier saints, Lest Satan work him ill! Lest in the hour of his great fight This foe should him assail, The enemy that creeps by night Strike through his coat of mail. Sebastian of the arrows, haste, Michael and the White Maid, Lest in his splendid hour, at last, The soldier be afraid. THE VESTAL She goes unwedded all her days Because some man she never knew, Her destined mate, has won his bays, Passed the low door of darkness through. Sometimes she has a wild surmise Of what dear name he used to have, And what the colour of his eyes, And was he gay, or was he grave. Or if his hair was brown or gold, Or if his voice was low and clear To tell his love with, never told To hers or any woman's ear. His voice is lost upon the wind; And when the rain beats on her heart His eyes elude her, warm and kind, Where the dim shadows steal apart. What of their children all unborn? What of the house they should have built? She wanders through her days forlorn, The untasted cup of joy is spilt. She lives unwedded,âas for him He sleeps too sound for any fret At their lost kisses, or the dream Of the poor girl he never met. THE OLD HOUSE The boys who used to come and go In the grey kindly house are flown. They have taken the way the young feet know; Not alone, not alone! Thronged is the road the young feet go. Yet in the quiet evening hour What comes, oh, lighter than a bird? Touches her cheek, soft as a flower. What moved, what stirred? What was the joyous whisper heard? What flitted in the corridor Like a boy's shape so dear and slight? What was the laughter ran before? Delicate, light, Like harps the wind plays out of sight. The boys who used to go and come In the grey house are come again; Of the grey house and firelit room They are fain, they are fain: They are come home from the night and rain. WHEN YOU COME HOME All will be right when you come home, dear lad, But oh, 'tis long of coming that you are! Everything's wrong with all the world and sad; There are so many hurt in this long war, So many missing, who will never come, Lying out in the rain and in the cold. I shall forget it all when you come home, I shall forget the lonesome things they told. There's something, something sad, that troubles me. Beats like the rain upon my frightened heart; A tale about a girl, the thing might be, Whispered in corners, secret and apart; How he was killed and how she never knew Because God put a small cloud on her mind, And how she waited the black winters through And the wet summers; surely God was kind! I took a daisy from the garden-bed And plucked the petals, one by one, to tell When I and my true lover should be wed, This year: Next year: Never: the petals fell And stopped at Never. But it could not guess, The foolish daisy, what true love I had. I turned from daisies and I plucked heartsease To rest my heart on and be safe and glad. Everything's wrong, Love, since you went away, Such a queer world when all the boys are gone, And there is no one left but old and grey, Women and children, frightened and alone. Sometimes the tale is crying at my heart Of that poor girl. Maybe 'twas but a dream. When you come home the shadows will depart, The lonesome dreams die off in morning gleam. THE LAST QUESTION (For B. A. Bingham) They lifted up his weary head, Stained with a dark and bitter dew: âHow does the battle go?â he said. âSir, it is victory,ââwhen he heard He smiled the darkening shadows through And died as blithe as a singing bird. On the stained grass as on a bed Dying he lay and well contentâ âSir, it is victory,â they said. So smiling, smiling all the way, To the undying Dead he went As to a heavenly holiday. A HOLY WEEK SONG, 1918 Now when Christ died for man his sake A myriad men must die; His Via Crucis they must take And share His Calvary. God keep ye, gallant gentlemen, Let nothing you dismay, Who share Lord Jesus Christ His pain Upon this Good Friday! Now some shall turn and meet His gaze And say, âRemember me When Thou art come to Thine own place Where ransomed sinners be!â God rest ye, gallant gentlemen, For ye are bought with price, This day there wends a shining train The way to Paradise. The day our Lord Christ lay in grave The dead are piled so high The field slow-moving like a wave Sends up a mortal cry. God love ye, gallant gentlemen, Let nothing you dismay, For life is born and Death is slain Upon the Easter Day. FLOWER O' THE YEAR The laggard year is now at prime And primrose-time is daffodil-time; Where do the boys delay? What tether Hinders them from the heavenly weather, From violet-time and cowslip-time? Why do they keep the house so late? The sweet o' the year is at the gate, And hear the cuckoo calling, saying: Up, slug-a-bed! 'Tis time for Maying! The cuckoo calling early and late. They have stolen away before the dawn, No print in the May-dew on the lawn Betrays the way their light feet taking Set not the quaking grass to shaking, Running so light-foot in the dawn. The primrose and the daffodil weather Is here, and cowslips troop together; The lambs frolic in pastures gold, But since they come not it is cold. Cold the primrose and daffodil weather. THE GREAT MAY Who said the Spring was dead? She would not come again, Dust on her starry head, For a sad world in pain? The thing they have said in vain, She comes new garlanded: Lovely on hill and plain Her lights, her flowers are shed. Never was such a May! Mercy of God, to prove Life springs from the clay And every treasured love Walks in a heavenly grove. The Lord God's holiday To the soft coo of the dove With the young lambs at play. Lo! yours, and yours, are there, I see them leap and run In a May-world past compare Whereof our God is sun. They rejoice, yea, every one In the ambient light and air, Their pleasures are not done From morn till evening star. Never was such a Spring! Oh, you whose eyes are wet, Listen, take comforting, Our God does not forget. Poor folk that fear and fret Your hours are on the wing To the loves that wait you yet, Raised up and triumphing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LOVE-LIES-BLEEDING WITH WOUND-WORT RECOMPENSE (For Lord Kilhacken) That which I saved I lost And that I lost I found, And you are mine, oh tender little ghost, Whose grave is holy ground. That which I kept is flown, So fast the children grow, The only child I keep to be my own I lost long years ago. The little ones that stayed Slip from me while I cry: Oh, not so fast, so fast, you golden-head. Swift as the wind they fly. Not two days are the same. To-morrow will not see To-day's young children, crested like a flame, Gathered about my knee. One day a day will dawn Will see me dispossessedâ An empty nest whence singing-birds have flown. Who shall refill the nest? The years run out like sand To strip me of my pride; Then in my hand will steal a clinging hand. I keep the child who died. God gives and does not lend This one lamb of the fold; And he will need his mother to the end And never will grow old. A BIRTH-NIGHT SONG The Child is rocked on Mary's knee, Cold in the stall this bitter night, And âLullalay-loo,â soft singeth she, âMy little Boy and Heaven's Delight!â When singing stars went up the sky The Prince of Peace oped a sweet eye. His Highness now how small He lies! He to be God and Very God! A Jacob's ladder spans the skies Whereof each rung is angel-trod, And all their carols are of Peace, Though the sick world hath little ease. Come in, poor war-worn folk, and rest; Kneel where the sinless creatures kneel; The Babe snugged warm in Mother's breast, He is your Wound-Wort, your All-Heal Balsam for hurts that throb and smart, Small Rose of Love on Mary's heart. Shut close within His hand so small The sick heart's medicine; not a sword. Come in, come in, sad people all, Here is your ancient peace restored! âLullalay-loo,â sings Mary mild, Kissing her God, her Lamb, her Child. THE CROWN She had twelve stars for diadem; She had for footstool the full moon; Her quiet eyes, outshining them, Kept memories of the night and noon And the still morns at Nazareth When in her arms the Child drew breath. So safe, so warm, He slept by her, In her enfolding arms at peace, Her milky babe, little and dear; And yet the Tree that should be His Grew in the forest, wide and high, Whose branches should fill all the sky. He made twelve stars into her crown And set the moon below her feet. He was King in Jerusalem Town, With twelve spines for His Coronet To pierce the brain and blood and bone, Were made for Man's Redemption. Oh, when she answered Gabriel With âBe it done!â could she foresee The high pangs that she took as well? With Bethlehem should be Calvary? Or was that moment of high bliss Born with sharp pangs, fierce agonies? Hath she beneath her Crown of Stars Remem brance of the thorns wherewith Her people crowned her Son? What scars, Redder than roses in a wreath, Doth she wear in a coronal Under the lights that rise and fall? A WOMAN COMMENDS HER LITTLE SON To the aid of my little son I call all the magnalitiesâ Archangel, Dominion, Powers and Principalities. Mary without a stain, Joseph that was her spouse, All God's women and men, Out of His glorious House. The Twelve Apostles by him: Matthew and Mark and John, Luke, the Evangelists nigh him, So he fight not alone. Patrick, Columcille, Brideâ The Saints of the Irish nation; Keiran, Kevin beside, In the death and the desolation. Listen, ye soldier saints, Sebastian, Ignatius, Joan, Be by his side; if he faints, Strengthen my little son. In the Side of Christ I lay him, In the Wound that the spear made; In the pierced Hands I stay him, So I am not afraid. On the knees of the Blessed Mary And in the fold of her arm, Refuge and sanctuary Where he shall take no harm. To the Wound in the Heart of Christ, To the Trinity Three in One, To the Blood spilled out, unpriced, For love of my little son. THE YOUNG SOLDIER Since you were so young, child, I shall Not fear your noon or even-fall, Nor dread you are taken unawares, Nor weary Heaven with many prayers. I shall not wake at night afraid Of where your darling head is laid, Nor say: âHe finds the wind too rough, Dear God!â for now the wind's left off. I shall have ease though lightnings leap, Nor hear the thunder in my sleep, Nor dread the crying of the seas, Nor any mountain precipice. God pity her who lies awake Unquiet for some darling sake! Soft sleeps my little son to-night, Where many stars make candlelight! His sword is laid beside his knees; God knows my little son hath easeâ And I, his mother, may go sleep And pray for them who wake and weep. THE BOYS OF THE HOUSE (For Valentine and Hubert Blake) Young martyrs of the war, Who with your bright eyes star The shadows grey; Who steal at dawn and gloam In each beloved room So pale, so gay. Boys who will not grow old, Peach cheek and hair of gold, Smile and are flown; You will come back again, In the darkness and the rain, In the dusk, in the dawn. Remember, oh, dear Two, Two who came after you Who love, as you loved, The grey house and the woods, All the sweet solitudes You loved, approved. Dear martyrs of the war, Remember, where you are, Boys who have still To do, to bear, to attain To your glory and your gainâ By what steep hill? ALIENATION For the first time since he was born Her son, her rose without a thorn, They are at variance, they who were Always such closest friends and dear. Another face is in his dreams Under the sunbeams and moonbeams. In his changed glances she discovers Something, some chill between two loversâ Something of fear, and oh, it hurts! But shall not Love have its deserts And win forgiveness, though she still Sets her poor will against his will? For all day long the battle calls, And in the quiet evenfalls, And in the night which else is dumb, He hears the bugle and the drum. And the wild longing in him stirs For the fierce battle. He's not hers. But she her hidden way will keep, Striving against him even in sleep, Praying against him loud and low, âPity me, so he may not go!â Calling on Heaven that it conspire Against him and his heart's desire. God pity mothers when their sons Grow cold, that were their little ones! ANY MOTHER âWhat's the news? Now tell it me.â âAllenby again advances.â âNo, it is not Allenby But my boy, straight as a lance is. âOh, my boy it is that runs, Hurls his young and slender body On the dread death-dealing guns. Oh, he's down! his head is bloody!â âHaig's offensive has begun.â âSay not Haig's nor any other, Since it is my one sweet son In the gases' risk and smother. âHe is taken by the throat, In the bursting flame will quiver, He the billet for all shot, He the shell's objective ever.â So not Allenby nor Haig, But her darling goes to battle. All the world's red mist and vague Shattered by the scream and rattle. Just one slender shape she sees, One bright head tossed hither, thither; Oh, if he goes down the seas Whelm her and the world together! PRAYER AT NIGHT Lord, for the one who dies alone This night without companion, I cannot rest, I cannot sleep. O shepherd of the piteous sheep Run with Thy crook, and lift in haste The poor head to Thy loving breast. Oh slake his deadly thirst from streams Of Paradise, and give him dreams Of the mild weather, the green sward. Bind up his bitter wounds, O Lord, And give him comfort. Let him know His Shepherd 'tis that loves him so. Thou countest Thy flock: not one is lost But Thou goest seeking, for Thou knowest The poor things creep away to die Where none shall find save Thou art nigh. Thou tak'st them to Thy arms, Thy knees, And Thy sick lambs have sweetest ease. Now I shall close my eyes in sleep, Nor fret since they are Thine to keep, Oh, happy sheep, to have such care, The poorest, Love's own prisoner, Who comforts as his mother might, Rocking him into sleep at night. THE VISION (Katia: Easter Sunday, 1916) She had a vision in the dark Ere the first lark from nest took flight; She saw her own son from fierce strife Win to new Life and new Delight. The clouds were tattered round his head As sore bested he fought his foe, Where in the conflict he was ta'en And slainâshe did not see it so. She saw indeed his bitter case In that sad place, parched, without shade, And how her Christian Knight must fall In Paynim thrall, should Heaven not aid. But now what light burns in the cloud? What voices loud against his ear? St. Andrew and St. Patrick ride Close by his side; St. George is near. His banner floats upon the breeze, Like a gold fleece it wraps him roundâ So, cap-Ã -pie from head to knee, His enemy he strikes to ground. He's won the day, he's won the day! See the light play upon his brow! Brave in his armour and upright The Christian Knight is riding now. She had that vision of her son When by the moon asleep she layâ And woke to singing birds and dew, And knew that it was Easter Day. A COLLOQUY (For M. W.) âWhen you get to Heaven, seek and find my boy. Mother him!â âUntil you come?â âI shall never come. Earth was good enough for me who had all my joy In my Love, my Light of home. âBut to him be given, in overflowing measure, All the joys your Heaven can give if your God be just! He, my boy slain in his youth to serve some mad king's pleasure And his dreams and hopes in dust.â âHow shall I know him where so many boys are? Multitudes and multitudes ever they increase.â âOh, my boy is young and tall, with bird-russet hair And quiet eyes of peace. âHe who was killed in a quarrel not his own! All his days he had good-will to his fellow-men. Oh, your God is kind and just, shall He not atone And the dark ways be made plain? âSeek my son and find him, so he shall not miss Me, his mother-comrade, through his length of days.â âOh, but he would turn from a strange woman's kiss And ask where his mother delays. âSo be up and going for the way's not long! God who kissed His Mother dear, a Babe in Nazareth, Knows how they need mother-love, the dear and precious young, In the new Life where is no Death.â PALESTINE: 1917 How strange if it should fall to you, To me, our boys should do the deed The great Crusaders failed to do! To win Christ's Sepulchre: to bleed, So the immortal dream come true. What ghosts now throng the Holy Ground, With rusted armour, dinted sword, Listening? The earth shakes with the sound; The wind brings hither a fierce word: To arms, to arms, Sons of Mabound! In many a quiet cloister grey Cross-legged Crusaders, men of stone, Quiver and stir the Eastward way, As they would spring up and be gone To the Great Day, to the Great Day. Godfrey and Lion-Heart and all The splendours of the faithful years Watch our young sons from the Knights' stall, Ready to clap hands to their spears If ill befall, if ill befall. They say: It is the Child's Crusade Was talked of in our early Spring. St. George, St. Denis, to their aid! That was a boy's voice challenging, Shrill like a bugle, unafraid! Most wonderful, if your son, my son, Should win the Holy Thing at last! The might of Heathenesse be undone, The strong towers down, the gate unfast, Lord Christ come to His own, His own. PILGRIMS TO THE EAST This Christmas-time my son will come, God willing, to the Holy Place And by the manger's little room Will bend his knee and bow his face, Eager, with shepherds and with kings, For to behold the Holy Things. The very child I made will see, God willing, little Bethlehem, The Garden of the Agony, Olivet and Jerusalem And climb to Calvary's sacred hillâ Ah, but the world is Calvary still! My own son's feet the dust shall press, God willing, where the Holy Feet Passed on His Father's business: And some high room above the street Shall stir a memory of that Feast Where He himself was Eucharist. Yea, by the Gate called Beautiful My son, my little son, shall go And bathe in Siloam's healing pool. Yet if God will not have it so At least my son, in His high Name, Has travelled towards Jerusalem. COMFORT Now she need dread no more to grow Too old for him, she need not know The bitterness when he who was All hers turns to some younger face, And she his mother stands aside, Bidding her heart be satisfied. She need not to her own heart say, âFool, to be jealous! Now give way. The young are for the young, and all The new things are but natural. Cast no least shadow on his feast; Be glad just to be second best.â She need not to her chill heart tell She's loved a different way, but well. And like that bird who leans her heart Upon a thorn to ease its smart Turn to the child who's taken his love So that her darling son approve. Now she's no longer dispossessedâ For second best's but second bestâ He's hers for all Eternity And she his one felicity. Her little son, as when he lay Small in her arms one heavenly day. THE REFRESHMENT If I could have foreseen this hour, What terror and anguish I had seen! And not this time of joy at flower, Cool waters and a garden green. All day the battle in the East Thunders. Dear Angels, keep him well! His mother sits as to a feast. O heart of steel invulnerable! All night I sleep the young child's sleep And waken to the robin's song, Blithe as the bird. Dear Angels, keep My darling the sharp spears among. Ah now, I know whose Arms enfold, I rest on such a mighty Heart; He hides my eyes lest they behold, In a most heavenly place apart. Lord, if this ease be but a lull Ere the deep seas are over my head, I shall have had, O Beautiful! This hour joy-filled and comforted. THE PROMISE To you and you it shall be given, As unto Mary her lost Heaven; Her Son and your son come Alive out of the grave and gloom. Like hers your bliss is pre-ordained To see the wounds healed and unstained; Yea, you shall kiss with her Where the sharp blade hath left no scar. They shall come in warm to your cold Dropped arms that found naught to enfold, And on your heart be laid The young, the beloved, thorn-crowned head. Sudden some dawning or some eve Your dead son shall come in alive, As once came Mary's Son; The lost, the incredible Heaven be won.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PANSIES THE DREAM (For my Father) Over and over again I dream a dream, I am coming home to you in the starlit gloam; Long was the day from you and sweet 'twill seem The day is over and I am coming home. Then I shall find you as in days long past, Sitting so quietly in the firelight glow; âLove,â you will say to me, âyou are come at last.â Your eyes be glad of me as long ago. All I have won since then will slip my hold, Dear love and children, the long years away; I shall come home to you the girl of old, Glad to come home to youâoh, glad to stay! Often and often I am dreaming yet Of the firelit window when I've crossed the hill And I coming home to you from night and wet: Often and often I am dreaming still. Over and over again I dream my dream. Ah, why would it haunt me if it wasn't true? I am travelling home to you by the last red gleam, In the quiet evening I am finding you. THE MOTHER GIVES UP HER DAUGHTER Though I must yield her up to you, her lover, I have had sweetness more than you can know, The little great-eyed maid beyond recover, And all her tender worship long ago. Oh, you are wild for her and little wonder! She is so fair, so honest, kind and true. But in the lonely house I sit and ponder On what was mine and shall not pass to you. Oh, little darling, how the years went flying, And I her moon, her stars, her heart's delight! I hardly knew my loss and the dear dying Of lovely childhood with the day and night. Take herâoh, she is sweet beyond all praises! You shall not have her childhood sweeter still, Gone with the dancing daffodils and daisies, Where she was mine upon a heavenly hill. THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN There's a Little Old Woman walks in the night, Singing her love song like a falling keen; The Little Old Woman is the heart's delight, With the gold crown under her hood to tell her queen. The Little Old Woman's coming up this way, Playing on her harp-strings a magic air; There's this one and that one, they may not stay, Stealing out in the night after the player. The Little Old Woman is at the door, Though 'tis a queen she is, in rags she goes, Open the door to her, long-waited for! Oh, Love and Delight you are, the Dear Black Rose. The Little Old Woman she is begging bread; She shall never go hungry while the ages pass, With the love of her lovers she shall be fed And their hearts lie under her feet in the green grass. They go from the lit board and the fire of peat And the dreams and the longing stir in the blood. Sweet to be poor with her, yea, death is sweet, For the Dear Rose of Beauty in the beggar's hood. VIGIL At night, when all the house is still, Wide-waked the chairs and tables come And yawn and stretch their limbs until The maids appear with pan and broom. Through the dim hours they creak and groan, Their laughter plays with tyrant Man, Shaken with stiff derision For his pretensions and his span. Where's then their willing servitude? Meek slaves for their creator's use. They make a mock of flesh and blood That passes with a morning's dews. The heart that once leaped in the tree Yet lives in the fantastic shapes That foolish Man hath made to beâ But see how wide yon cupboard gapes! With âYoursâ and âMineâ they make great sport, Who saw us come and see us go, And will be when no least report Of us but what a stone can show. When ghosts and owlets flit abroad, The furniture's awake, aware, The floor complaining of its load, And what a creaking of the stair! THE GARDEN I know a garden like a child, Clean and new-washed and reconciled. It grows its own sweet way, yet still Has guidance of some tender will That clips, confines, its wilder mood And makes it happy, being good. Around the lordly mountains stand, For this is an enchanted land, As though their splendours stood to grace This little lovely garden place, Looking with wise and keeping eyes Upon the garden sanctities. Box borders edge each little bed, Paths narrow for a child to tread Divide the kitchen garden, dear And sweet with musk and lavender, And water-mints and beans in bloom. Be sure the honey-bee's at home. How should I tell in a sweet list Of beauties, rose and amethyst; The little water-garden cool On sultry days, and beautiful The wall-garden, the shade, the sun, Since they are lovely, every one. Hot honey of the pines is sweet, And when the day's at three o'clock heat A winding walk will you invite To a new garden out of sight. And a green seat is set so near The sluggish, stealing backwater. The Spirit of the garden plays At hide-and-seek an hundred ways And when you've captured her, she will Elude you, calling backward still, A silver echoâa sweet child, Demure and lovesome, gay and wild. WIND O Wind, I cannot see you pass, And yet I feel you as you go Around the world and every place, Shouting and singing loud and low. Your breath, your touch, is on my cheeks, Such soft caressing finger-tips! Can it be you whose anger wrecks The high trees and the tallest ships? You run so light o'er field and hill, You shake no frailest blossom down, And yet make havoc when you will O'er land and sea, in country and town. I hear you waking up from sleep Over the hills and far away, You giant, roaring as you leap O'er lambs and daisies at their play. O Wind, your name makes music sweet! You are a lovely thing, O Wind! And how the world were incomplete Without your unseen presence kind. For now your arms are round my neck, And now your buffets are too rough. And your sharp kisses on my cheek, And your fierce clasp and your wild love. The fool hath said it in his heart There are no miracles. O Wing Confute him when you fly apart Close-felt, beloved, invisible Thing. MENACE Oh, when the land is white as milk With bloom that lets no leaf between, When trees are clad in grass-green silk And thrushes sing in a gold screen: What is it ails Dark Rosaleen? Why is the banshee in the night Crying for all the young men gone? Now when the world with bloom is white, When the good sun's warm on the stone, Why does the Woman of Death make moan? As one who is not comforted, I heard in every lonely glen Dark Rosaleen cry for her dead And for her dying race of men. Dark Rosaleen, take heart again! For, oh, there's God in His high place And Patrick seated by His side To judge with Him the Irish race; And Columcille, Kieran and Bride Shall not forget before God's Face. There's Mary of the Seven Swords, Queen of the Gaelâoh, many a saint, With Oliver Plunkett to look towards The Mercy Seat, with praise and plaint, For Rosaleen, ever the Lord's. Oh, weep no more, Dark Rosaleen! Menace and terror pass you by. Oh, loved beyond the sceptred queen, Dark Rosaleen for whom men die! And loved till death, Dark Rosaleen. WINGS IN THE NIGHT Now in the soft spring midnight There's rush of wings and whirr, Birds flying softly, swiftly; The night's a-flutter, a-stir. Home by the bitter seas, They have sped home together. So glad to be coming home To the grey hills, the grey weather. Calling and calling softly One lights by the window-pane: The rook, weary with building, Turns to his sleep again. Ere ever the moor-hens wake And the wild duck come in, The birds are about the house With a long call and thin. They have wakened the wood-pigeon To make her plaintive moan, The wood-pigeon lamenting For sorrows not her own. Oh, they are never birds, But souls of men on the wind, Seeking the mother's breast, The heart that is soft and kind. Souls of the Irish dead, Flown from the fields of slaughter, Home to the mother's arms Over the wild grey water. THE REFUGE I will lift mine eyes to the mountains, To the mountains whence cometh my aid; I shall drink of the Mercy's crystal fountains, And shall not be afraid. St. Patrick and St. Bride be with me, And all the saints of the Gael; The wings of Heaven above and beneath me, The dead of Inisfail. The caves of the mountains shall receive me, I shall lie as at a mother's breast; The white food the King of Heaven shall give me, And the wine of Heaven for feast. Where the eagle screams over Nephin, Where the Reek of Patrick looks on the isles, From the voices of the world that fret and deafen, From the evil in her smiles, I shall creep, and the mountains will hold me, As a lamb that runs with the ewe, The warmth of the mother shall enfold me, I shall have milk and dew. EVENING (In Connaught) Gold from the edges of the horizon flowing, A great and golden sea: The light's spilled out of heaven and flowing, growing A gold immensity. The sea-bird now has gotten a golden feather, Gold are the Hundred Isles, Gold the white cabin like a cloud at tether Where the long evening smiles. The water-bird floats on the golden water, Golden her wings and crest As she were Fionnuala, the King's daughter, Preening a golden breast. The bog-pools now are fringed with golden lances, The bog-cotton's aflame; Gold are the mountains that were purple as pansies, Since the wild heather came. Oh, Heaven's o'er-arched with gold, that washing, flooding, Drenches, with golden rain The Dark Rose in her splendour, dreaming, brooding, That she is crowned again. AFTER ASCENSION Those twelve years from Ascension Until the day of meeting broke, She was not so much all alone As it might seem to common folk, Because no day passed without bliss: He gives Himself back to her kiss. He comes no more in human guise, Yet He is in their midst again. His wounds are there in all men's eyes, So doubting Thomas sees them plain; They pour the Wine and break the Bread, And the heart's hunger's comforted. The Apostle takes the Cup of Wine, The white Bread on the paten bright, O Food of angels dear, divine! The Lord of Life comes down in light, And sweeter than the honeycomb Rests in the heart that was His home. Give place! His Mother's claim is first; Her arms embrace her Son once more: On the kind breast where He was nurst He hath sweet ease as oft before. Morn after morn, through the twelve years, His love makes rapture of her tears. She guards the youngling Church as once She kept her small Son while He grew, Safe sheltered from the winds and suns, Comforted with soft rain and dew; Till it's full-grown and she is free For the long bliss that is to be. COLOURS Blues and greens are my delight Set in garlands of the white. When God made the violet He made nothing better yet. Lilac and the lavender Fit for queens of Heaven to wear. Many russets and the rose, God be praised for these and those! For the silvers and the greys Likewise ye shall give Him praise. Scarlet is a King's colour That the King of Kings once wore. Yet when everything is said, Bring me neither rose nor red. Give me blue and green below, Apple bloom and cherry snow. Blue forget-me-nots beneath Pear and plum-bloom in a wreath. Or wild hyacinths in a gladeâ Nothing better God has made. Blues and greens and a white bough Turn the earth to Heaven now. EPIPHANY (For Dora, 1918) She carried frankincense and gold When the Star guided her, And in her folded hands so cold She carried myrrh. Frankincense for the praise she owed, Gold for her gift was meet, But myrrh because so oft her road Was bitter-sweet. Lay her tired body in that earth Was holy to her mind! But the bird-soul flies in high mirth, Borne on the wind. It tosses in the Irish skies Awhile, so small and white, Ere it is goneâswiftly it flies Into the light. She has gone in with the Three Kings, In silk and miniver; The gold, the frankincense she brings, The sharp-sweet myrrh. THE IMAGE When a wild grace I see, A turn o' the neck, a curl, sweet hands, clear eyes, Gentleness, courtesy, dignity; In all these gifts Thee I surmise, surprise. All beauty and delight. Skin like a rose, a beauteous shape, an air Free and enchanting, give my weary sight Glimpses of Thee, Thou Beauty past compare. Strength, courage also are Thine. And joy of youth and wings that cleave the blue, Low singing and soft voices, I divine In these Thy beauty ancient yet ever new. Oh, when my startled eye Perceives this beauty league-long, sea and isle And eagle-crested mountains wild and high, I catch Thy Maker's thoughtâI see Thy smile. Some mirror out of range Flashes reflex of Heaven on this sweet earth, Brooding for ever, beautiful, without change, The blue-bell sea, the thousand streams' soft mirth. All beauty is of Thee. Kindness and quietness, moon and stars and sun, Gardens and woods, the bird in the new-fledged tree And sleep, O Kindest One! THE AERODROME So now the aerodrome goes up Upon my father's fields, And gone is all the golden crop And all the pleasant yields. They tear the trees up, branch and root, They kill the hedges green, As though some force, malign and brute, Ravaged the peace serene. There where he used to sit and gaze With blue and quiet eyes, Watching his comely cattle graze, The walls begin to rise. What place for robin or for wren, For thrush and blackbird's call? Now there shall be but flying men Nor any bird at all. 'Twas well he did not stay to know, Defaced and all defiled The quiet fields of long ago, Dear to him as a child. But when the tale was told to me I felt such piercing pain, They tore my heart up with the tree That will not leaf again. A SONG OF GOING I would not like to live to be very old, To be stripped cold and bare Of all my leafage that was green and gold In the delicious air. I would not choose to live to be left alone, The children gone away, And the true love that I have leant upon No more my staff and stay. I would not live to stretch my shrivelled hands To an old fire died low, Minding me of the long-lost happy lands And children long ago. Let me be gone while I am leafy yet And while my birds still sing, Lest leafless, birdless, my dull heart forget That ever it had Spring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LADDERS TO HEAVEN GOOD FRIDAY, A.D. 33 Mother, why are people crowding now and staring? Child, it is a malefactor goes to His doom, To the high hill of Calvary He's faring, And the people pressing and pushing to make room Lest they miss the sight to come. Oh, the poor malefactor, heavy is His load! Now He falls beneath it and they goad Him on. Sure the road to Calvary's a steep up-hill roadâ Is there none to help Him with His Crossânot one? Must He bear it all alone? Here is a country boy with business in the city, Smelling of the cattle's breath and the sweet hay; Now they bid him lift the Cross, so they have some pity: Child, they fear the malefactor dies on the way And robs them of their play. Has He no friends then, no father nor mother, None to wipe the sweat away nor pity His fate? There's a woman weeping and there's none to soothe her: Child, it is well the seducer expiate His crimes that are so great. Mother, did I dream He once bent above me, This poor seducer with the thorn-crowned head, His hands on my hair and His eyes seemed to love me? Suffer little children to come to Me, He saidâ His hair, his brows drip red. Hurrying through Jerusalem on business or pleasure People hardly pause to see Him go to His death Whom they held five days ago more than a King's treasure, Shouting Hosannas, flinging many a wreath For this Jesus of Nazareth. DISTRACTION When swarms of small distractions harry Devotion like the gnats that fly Till prayers are cold and customary, Not such as please Thee, Heaven-high. When I forget for all my striving Thy presence holy and august, Be Thou not angry, but forgiving To her Thou madest from the dust. Say to Thyself: This mortal being, So deaf, so blind, so prone to sin, Has glimpses of Me without seeing The places where the nails went in. Say: Through the crusts of earth, My creature Perceives Me, hails Me Lord above; Rumours of the lost innocence reach her, With full assurance of My love. Say: Of all marvels I have fashioned Is none more wonderful and new As that this thing should go impassioned For heights beyond her mortal view. What though her mind should play and ponder On small things meet for such as she! O love! O loyalty! O wonder! That in the darkness gropes for Me. THE DESERTED Thou Who wert kindest of the kindâ Since out of sight is out of mindâ There's none to do Thee kindnesses In Thy last anguish and distress. Thou art left all alone, alone. Where are Thy faithful lovers flown? Where is the multitude that fed, With loaves and fishes comfortÃ¨d? The blind Thou mad'st to see? the lame That walked? the one leper who came Of nine made clean? The dumb that spoke? Where are theyâall Thy loving folk? How is it they have naught to say? Where's Lazarus risen from the clay? Where is the widow of Nain? where Jairus's daughter, small and fair? Judas has sold Thee to Thy foes, And Peter weeps while the cock crows. Simon will help Thee on Thy road Unwillinglyâah, Lamb of God! Thou bearest the world's weight up that hill, And none to help Thee with good will; Stumbling and falling, while Thy hurt Makes for the rabble noble sport. But yet there's balm in Gilead, For here's His Mother, sweet and sad, Here's Magdalen weeping, and with them The women of Jerusalem; They have run all the way since one Brought them the news: He's not alone! Veronica is nothing loth To wipe His poor face with her cloth. His Mother's by Him and St. John, With many a starry legion; Magdalen's hair is round His feet, Her tears wash off the blood and sweat. Thou Who wert kindest of the kind, Though out of sight be out of mindâ Thou art not forgot: by land and sea The broken hearts come home to Thee, And bear Thine anguish and Thy grief Till the Third Day shall bring relief. LENTEN COMMUNION Rest in a friend's house, Dear, I pray: The way is long to Good Friday, And very chill and grey the way. No crocus with its shining cup, Nor the gold daffodil is up,â Nothing is here save the snowdrop. Sit down with me and taste good cheer: Too soon, too soon, Thy Passion's here; The wind is keen and the skies drear. Sit by my fire and break my bread. Yea, from Thy dish may I be fed, And under Thy feet my hair spread! Lord, in the quiet, chill and sweet, Let me pour water for Thy feet, While the crowd goes by in the street, Why wouldst Thou dream of spear or sword, Or of the ingrate rabble, Lord? There is no sound save the song of a bird. Let us sit down and talk at ease About Thy Father's business. (What shouts were those borne on the breeze?) Nay, Lord, it cannot be for Thee They raise the tallest cross of the three On yon dark Mount of Calvary! So soon, so soon, the hour's flown! The glory's dying: Thou art gone Out on Thy lonely way, alone. THE TEST Love has moods: and I am cold, Very cold ofttimes to Thee; Fain to slip from Thy dear hold To my follies and be free. Yet I love: Thou knowest all. I am Thine in heat and chill; Thou, Thou hast my heart in thrall, All my life and all my will. Thou, Immortal Lover, sure Knowest the way that lovers have, Now so cold, afraid, unsure, Now afire with love and brave. If I loved less it might be That the way was smoother, less Of the heavenly joys for me And the cast-down bitterness. I am coldâbe that Love's proof!â And I burnâthe proof again!â I would not be smooth but rough Lest the smoother love should wane. Give me earth or Heavenâand yet If it is Love's test to swing 'Twixt the earth and Heaven still setâ IâI ask no other thing. NOÃL I heard a song upon Christmas day And the feet of many going one way, The word the golden voice did say: Gloria in Excelsis! The air was filled with snowflakes white, And the singing stars danced in their flight, Sweet the song they sang in the night, Et in terra pax! Good singing folk, where is there peace, And for the broken heart heartsease? They chant: Come hither upon your knees, Venite ad Bethlehem! For now the Prince of Peace is born; For the full heart and the heart forlorn He signs His Peace upon Christmas Morn: Adeste Fidelis!</field>
