      <field name="fulltext">God standeth in the congregation of the gods: hee is Iudge amongst the gods. Psal. Lxxxii. To the very vertuous and my singular good Lady, the Lady Leighton, one of the Ladies of the Queenes Maiesties most honorable priuie Chamber: the Pilgrime wisheth a long and happie life, with such increase of honour, as her Ladiships godly indeuours doe deserue. The Preface. A poore Pilgrime who seekes the circle rounde Of all the worlde to finde his heartes desire, On tope of hie Pernassas hill hee found This booke, which al the Muses did admire, With golden chain on deske of Genepire Fast lockt it lay vpon Apollos seate. This in his brest did kindle first the fire, Both night and day he did the Gods intreate, Long time hee serude with trickling droppes of sweate Like drudge to learnings Ladies small and great: And in the ende they gaue him for his hyre Such knowledge as of them hee did require. Minerua nowe reuealed is renownde, For fame her name and due desart doth sounde: Her happie head with goodly crowne is crownde, Long may shee liue and clime in honour hier, All meanes remoude that may moue her to ire The Pilgrime praies, doubting his owne retyre. Goe streight and feare not. A Reuelation of the true Minerua. Almightie Ioue, he Saturne sage did sende, Commanding Mars, &amp; Mercury to meet, Apollo passing prudent did attend: And Neptune left the seas, and all his fleete, The God of gods, these Goodly Gods did greete: Then thus he saide, let it be knowen by you, Whom I on earth most worthie doe auowe. Forespent with speede, consumde well neere with haste, Pallas, shee there did piteously complaine, Both I, and all the worlde is quite digrast, My deare sister, Minerua mine, in vaine I liue alas, for now there doth remaine, No no, not one Minerua done away, Which in her place is meete to beare the sway. The Muses mourne, and mourne they may for mee Sith goddesse shee of greatest grace is gone, Poore Pallas I perplext with miserie, Am left alone, (alas) and all alone: To you, you gods my state I doe bemone, And if you will haue Pallas still remaine, Then you a newe Minerua must ordaine. Apollo sate with Saturne by his side, Hence Mercury, goe get thee hence hee saide, Doe seeke and searche through all the worlde so wide For her, who may bee newe Minerua made, Whose due deserued fame shall neuer fade. The winged God went thence as swift as winde: And Saturne sage did thus declare his minde. All sauage then like tearing Tigers fell, more bruite then beastes, there lust most lewd was law: Men liude when I a man with men did dwell, Then men by men were rent and eaten rawe: From wicked wilde euen I these men did drawe To ciuile life, by my good gouernment: They were inclinde to knowe what reason ment. Then lawes I made, and right at last did raigne, All men with one consent put to their hande: From hilles and woods in the most pleasant plaine men met like friendes, and as they there did stand, Both how, and who, should rule, and till the land I did ordaine, cities and townes they then did builde, of beastes, they were by mee made men. Then none did eate the sweete of others sweat, For thine by right, and merie mine I made, Therefore a God of all the gods most great They me ordainde, my fame can neuer fade Till heauen and all the earth be quite decaide: For Saturne sits aloft in seemely sphere, Euen so doth Mars (said Mars) as you shall heare. Thy mine and thine did breede such bitter strife, From out the worlde when thou wert once away, As euerie man did seeke eche others life, That witlesse will might haue the power of may To rule vnruld, to beare the chiefest sway: Then king with king, the weakest went to wracke, And mightie mine made feeble thine his lacke. Then might was right, for all thy lawes were lame, The goodly ground with blood was then imbrude, Then warres and warlike weapons I did frame, And force perforce, I right againe renude, Most quiet peace my bloodie warres insude: My trayned troupes of souldiers kept in awe, All such whose lewdnesse made their luste a lawe. You greatest gods doe graunt and giue me grace, Silenus sage (all Satier like) did say: To tell a truth here in this presse and place: Mars halfe amazde, his story there did stay: They gaue him leaue, then he without delay. men may bee gods, euen gods of great degree, Such gods must die like men, and so did wee. Why, howe, and who, by God and men bee made, Of mortall men immortall gods giue eare, when due deserued fame can neuer fade: Report by right aboue the earth shall reare All such, and set their names in seemely sphere, Such liue on earth more happie then the rest: Such haue in heauen a blisse of al the best. Bacchus did plant, and Ceres sowde the grounde, Neptune deuisde the swelling Seas to saile, Apollo for his learning was renownde: For worldly wit dame Pallas did preuaile, Euen shee who heere Mineruas want doth waile, Hæc prud?tiæ, illa sapi?tiæ dea. These all were gods by due desart, and shee A goddesse, next Minerua by degree. For heauenly wisedome Minerua. shee exceld eche one, Her knowledge was, the soule from sinne to saue, Which knowledge nowe is knowne alas to none, For all the worlde it is so bounsing braue As none, no one doth thinke vpon his graue: If Sapiens diuine wisdome bee dead, Then Pallas may with teares consume her bred. Diuinitie is made a masking coate, To compasse what the diuelishe doe deuise, Deceite and craft hath set their force aflote, All men haue wit, and no man nowe is wise: Like Proteas proude they do themselues disguise, No Gods but Diuels, no men but beastes they bee: Practising craft and deepe hypocrisie. As men before Saturnus time were rude, Nowe much more brute and sauage they will bee, If care of conscience doth not sinne detrude: You must therefore erect diuinitie, And one ordaine of great and good degree, Who must possesse Mineruas former place, So all the worlde true knoweledge will imbrace. Then hee and they all silent sodenlie, Their musing mindes did mourne and maruaile much, That this the last and latter age shoulde bee Forlorne, the greeued Gods heere at did grutch. Then Mercurie his quicke returne was suche, Like hagarde haulde from haughtie heauen hee fell, And thus hee did to them his trauell tell. Where Troy once stood no citie nowe doth stande, A rude vnlearned rowte in Thebs remayne, In Athens nowe there be a beastly bande, And Rome is rude her vaunting is in vayne: Euen so is France, all Italy, and Spayn, No Liuye liues, no Tully can bee found, There is not one good Poët on the ground. That haughtie hill Parnassus heauenly hie For learning where the louly Laurell grewe, The bramble brier hath got the victorie: The bankes once braue with flowres of goodly hewe, All Helecon is blacke with moulded blewe: Permessus springes be drie, the Nymphes be dead, The gorgious garlands gone, the Muses flead. The warres hath wipt what worthie was away, And Barbarye doth Christendom deuoure, The Turke, the Moore, the prince of Persia, They dayly do increase in strength and power, They learning lothe, they build like beastes their bower In igoraunce, they feare nor God nor diuell, They hate the good, they honour what is euill. Yet I am sent that Phœnix rare to finde Whom all in vaine I seeke and can not see, And yet shee liues, and is of Saturns kinde, Begot by Mars, preserud by Ioue, and shee Remaynes aliue, in place not knowne to mee, The firme of all the worlde my selfe haue sought, Yet her to finde the Oracle hath taught. Where Arctike poole with Guardes doth stand L. and two Lacking a third part. degrees from lande Minerua doth remaine: Where want of warre and quiet peace Hath cloid the countrey with increase of gold and goodly graine, Where Troynouant, where Athens newe, where noble Nymphes do dwell, Where manie modest Muses be, euen such as do excell. This greatest goddesse there in throne Of highest dignitie alone doth sit, and beare the sway: Olympus there, Pernassus hie, Permessus springes be neuer drie, the ground is greene and gay: The Palme and Laurell there doth growe, euen there her biding is, Out from the worlde, yet on the grounde, euen in a place of blisse. There comes quoth noble Neptune to my mind That same of yore which sober Sybill saide, When Mercurie in vaine shall seeke to finde: When all the worlde with warres shall be dismaide: When learnings light shall seeme to be decayde: Let Neptune then reioyce with triple mace, Let all the gods depart and giue him place. Where at the gods greatly greeued did frowne, And saide, the sea could not the lande excead: But suddainely there was a goodly crowne With garlandes gay on noble Neptunes head, Imbroderd braue in romane letters redde All percell gilt, and burnished with blewe, The truth was set, and thus it did insewe. The tearing tract of time hath wasted and worne out the worthie, The mightie maine now may mourne such losse, sith the sea hath her glory. The greeued gods did maruell all amazde, Such vnknowne sightes vpon this crowne were seene, About the toppe a swelling sea was raysde: In which a chalkie cliffe with medowes greene, There in on stately throne a royall Queene, A pransing Pegasus stood by the dame, And on his backe sat euerlasting fame. On hiest toppe a heauenly angell stood, Harde by his side a Harraulde had his place, From raging seas, euen from the Ocean flood Appearde a prince, bolde Brutus by his grace, To Harraulde he declarde his royall race: The king at armes his petigree he pende, The Angel markte and did his misse amende, The Queene to noble Brutus blood was found By long desent alied linially, Aeneas he who was so much renownde From him did Brute descende successiuely: The wandering prince had his natiuitie For him who was the eldest sonne, in seat His grandsier sat, of all the gods most great. The seat wherein this courtly Queene did sit was Rubie rare, none seene for sice so great, a golden globe was vnder both her feete, a comely cloude did compasse all the seate, the sea in vayne the cloude and globe did beate with foming froth, about her heauenly heade Pallas persaude a posie, which shee reade. Not such a godesse againe in Asia, Europ, or Affricke, for vertue, great degree, for her magnanimitie, Nowe let Apollo giue place, let Neptune sit in the chiefe seat, sith in his sea she doth dwel, ruling a world at her wil, Blissed &amp; blissed againe, three times thrise happie minerua, with thee and thine estate no mortal m? may c?pare. Then Pan (when Neptune had Apollos place) that rurall god and clownishe rustikes king, with shepheardes three attending on his grace, he plide his pipe, the one of them did sing, the second sighth, the third his handes did wring, when pastor Pan persaude their pitious plight, his pipe laide down he made his men resight their cause of care. From walled towne I Bembus wonted was a mightie masse of money once a yeere full xl. crownes I did returne, alas nowe xx. grootes I can not compasse cleere, my stocke, my store, my houshold stuffe most deere, I spend, and spoyle, and all to none auayle, lawgh he that list, Bembus shall weepe and wayle. On pleasant pipe to play did please me much, I did delight sweete ditties to indight: But nowe the woes of wretched warres be such As nothing els but howe in fielde to fight, And howe to keepe the flocke from souldiers sight: That rauening woolfe, whose neuer filled mawe With rage doth make his wicked will a lawe. Poore Colon I, and careful Comma shee My weded wife, once happie, nowe forlorne, Let vs complayne of fortunes crueltie, The countries grace, and nowe the countries scorne, X. men, v. flockes, v. plowes, to sowe my corne I keept, but nowe the greater is my care My flockes be stolne, my fruitfull fieldes be bare. The people for the princes pride are plagde, It falleth to the faultlesse subiectes lot, To double drinke in cruel cuppe of care, When peruerse princes madding minde doth dote: Bellona then doth sounde a dolefull note, Then blooddie men of warre the sweete doth eate Without regard of vs the shepheardes sweate. My Bembus deare thou knowest this Sommer last, Whose armie laide all leuell with the grounde Our corne halfe ripe, our vines were spoild as fast, Our townes be burnt, our woods worth many a pound Be quite destroyde, and where may nowe be founde One hedge, or ditch, not torne nor troden downe, This cursed crop we reape from hie renowne. In winter nowe when Boreas bitter blast Forbiddes in field that armed men shoulde meete, A greater griefe we countrey men do tast, Wee cessed are, the souldier eates thei sweete Of all our toile, a thing nor iust nor meete, Such is my state: yet this my hireling when Pan doth pipe what doth he then but sing. And sing thy seruaunt must good Colon, he Doth hope to haue (as he before hath had) A place of rest exempt from miserie, You both (I thinke) do sinne to be so sadde, Take mine aduise and be you euer glad, Do followe mee, forsake these fieldes though knowne, My selfe can giue the like they be mine owne. For I Epizenes a pastor am, Though nowe thy man yet I my selfe keepe men; With in my fieldes skipes many a lustie lambe, I dwell where beefe and bacon meate for men, where milke and honie floweth like the fenne: I dwell where want of warre and quiet rest Doth plainely proue Brittaine to be the best. Epizenes thou seemst to haue no sence, Bembus shall proue thee mad or ignorant, If so it be, why didst thou runne from thence? wherefore? because all thinges they be so scant where thou doest dwell, that naked neede and want Did driue thee thence, my neighbour Colon can Report thy state, when first thou wert his man. Bembus, do heare the storie of my state, Cloyd with the blisse which nowe I doe desire, I knowe not what the frowarde force of fate I being well, did make mee to aspire, By trauell I did thinke to clime vp hier, Thus not content in paradize to dwell, seeking for heauen, I founde out hatefull hell, By sea and lande my selfe with restlesse toyle The circle rounde of all the worlde haue sought, Since first I left my louely natiue soyle with deere expense my knoweledge I haue brought, The spice of Spayne, Canary wine is nought, The grapes of Fraunce, the fruite of Italye, Nor pleasant fieldes in Flanders pleaseth mee, What taxe, what tolle, what tribute do they pay? with dayly warres, what wretched liues they leade? Kinges they do cause continuall decay, Their subiectes liue in daily doubt and dread. They wofull wightes, do hate their hurtfull head, They curse their kings, like slaues which make th? serue, They till and toile, and yet for food they starue. Oppression rules with cruell tyrannie, In Spayne is spitefull superstition spread: Harde roughnes doth remaine in Germany, Fidelitie from faithlesse Fraunce was flead: In Italie fancie is suprime head: Blinde ignoraunce in Barbary remaine, The Turke doth loue the diuell, and God disdaine. But none of these in Britayne braue abide, Where godesse great Elizabeth doth raine. For God almightie with his grace doth gyde Her highnesse heart, and all her courtly trayne, That happie he who may with her remaine: Both poore and rich doth quietly possesse Their owne, the hauen of heauenly happinesse. When lust most leude made iustice leaue the lawe: And vice destroyd dame vertues stately stile: Diuinitie esteemde not worth a strawe: These three disdaind were banisht to exile, They left the lande, on seas they saild a while, And at the last on Brittayne braue they fell, Where queene Eliza made these Ladies dwel. Religion first a certaine signe of grace, Not next, but in her highnes heauenly heart, Amidst her minde vertue did take her place: Shee did commaund Iustice not to depart From her right hande, nor from her side to start: Then thus shee spake, during my doubtfull date I will bee Queene, you three shall rule my state. Epizenes (quoth) Pan if Bembus bee, If Colon with his Comma be content, Wee will depart to place vnknowen with thee, And sell or let the sheep courses for rent: Some god perhappes thy selfe hath hither sent, Vs to conduct to place where as wee may Liue like the men in rich Eutopia. And better much for libertie and gaine, if so you will, then let vs hence away. The windes bee good, doe neuer thinke it payne to sayle the Seas, within a month wee may haue happie hauen, and bee in blessed bay: my selfe will take that stately charge in hande, to guide your course, and winne the wished land. With this crosse staffe, wherewith I wonted was, height, length, and breadth of euery thing to tell, with that, and with an Astrolob of brasse, Globe, Compasse, a Nocturnall will doe well, with these, and with my Carde which doth excell, I so will saile, as you shall vnderstande: that Palinurus hate the Helme in hande. When Titan sittes in middayes circle seate, when goodly Guardes doth Artike Pole displaie, then shall you see a shephearde doe the feate, and perfectly direct you on your way: ouer the place where as I meane to stay, The North starre stands at fiftie two degree, That height founde out, wee finde felicitie. They were content, and as they did depart, The greatest god of all this goodly traine, I see (hee saide) thou hast the Sea mans Art: My Mercurie hath ceaselesse sought in vaine, Minerua there, Minerua doth remaine: Goe foorth my sonne and trauaile to newe Troy: Hee went, and came, and brought encrease of ioy. For as you see the swiftest Swallowes wing, Doth cut the skie, and leaues her haunt behind: So Mercurie the post of Gods did bring His message backe, whome Homer hath assignde: A messenger to them of heauenly kinde: To whome he did with speede his speeche adresse, And thus what hee had seene he did expresse. My trauaile proues the Oracle most true, The workmanship on Neptunes noble crowne, Doth represent halfe the deserued due, Of her the greatest goddesse of renowne: Minerua liues, let Pallas cease to frowne, She is aliue, my selfe her grace haue seene, In maiestie, of Britayne braue the Queene. To whom when first I made my message knowne, And saide, O Queene the gods doe thee salute, Saturne himselfe whose fame about is blowne: Mars Neptune, and Apollo great by brute, Pallas thy younger sister hath a sute vnto thy grace, they all, but chiefly she, Sent mee to know thy state and great degree. The Queene replide, I knowe no God but one And hee of heauen, who guides mee by his grace: The Heathen had their Gods which nowe bee gone, Whose Idols I by Gods spell did deface: There is one God and him I doe imbrace, No sister I, yet what they doe intende declare, for I all goodnes will defend. Most mightie prince Saturne doth signifie good gouernment: Neptune and Mars of might By Sea and land in warre haught valiancie, Apollo how diuinely to indight, Pallas wisdome to rule and raigne aright: Such vertues great from these men did descende, They are and shal be gods vnto the end. Yet banisht nowe they liue in darke exile, For where is valure or good gouernemente? Learning hath left her former stately stile, From prudence craft her right with rage hath rent: The cause why these destressed Gods haue sent me to this Ile, from that most mightie maine is this, they heare thy highnesse here doth raigne By right, ruling thie Realme with equitie, Heauenlie wisdome and godly zeale doth rest with thee, pitie and perfect pietie: God with his grace aboundantly hath blest thy grace, and thee inritcht aboue the rest, They, (other) Princes of another kinde Doe banishe such as thou doest seeke to finde. Hopelesse of helpe which when these gods did heare, They sent in post on message Mercury: I am not fame which flyeth here and there For Mercurie deare dame, doeh signifie A messenger, and for the gods am I Sent with this sute, if it may please thy grace, Both they and I will serue thee in this place. And then the Queene, my seruants? no, my saints, Copertiners of my crowne and dignitie: Let them leaue off their heeretofore complaints: Bid them come rule this mightie Realme with mee, And let them knowe my state and great degree: Tell them that nothing can delight mee more, Then they whose names I chiefly doe adore. Then might you see the prudent Pallas glade, And all her mourning garments done away, All her assistants sighde and sobd ful sad: Reioyced nowe, and Solemnizde that day With songes, and making garlandes gorgeous gay: Then thus shee spake, good Mercury at large, Report the thinges committed to thy charge. His replie.Her heauenly hewe, her more then mortall grace, (For vertue may mortall immortall make,) Her stately steppes, her princelie royall race, Her Maiestie makes mortall men to quake, Her dignitie doth make the gods to shake: When earthly eyes her highnesse doe behold, They doe affirme her forme not from the moulde. Ouer her head, angels with swordes in hande, Betwixt her eyes doth right remorse remaine, Before her face the feare of God doth stande, Salomons blisse abideth in her braine, Her eares bee stopt to matters vilde and vaine: From goodlie lips her learned tongue doth tell The way to heauen, where shee no doubt doth dwell. Contented life within her minde doth rest, Vpon her breast doth perfect blisle abide, And charitie doth sit vpon her chest: A certaine sure state that cannot slide Is fixt as best beseemes fast to her side, Most worthie prayse for her virginitie, Diana neuer halfe so chaste as she. Her arme doth rule a mightie Realme by right, Her hande doth giue eche one his due desart, To walke in righteous wayes is her delight, From perfect path her feete doe not depart, Her steppes most straight doe shew her heauenly heart, Vnder her feete raging reuenge doth couch, At her commaunde her valure to auouche. When treasons spightful, hid conspiracies, They woulde vntwine her worthie warped twist: These heauenly Angels then with Argus eies, Doe force the blooddie blade from traytours fist, Whose gotten gaine is heauie had I wist: When forraigne foes would reaue her princely crown, Then blacke reuenge doth beate their boastings down. This true report whilst Maias sonne hath made, And brought the gods from maruaile to a maze, Withouten shape all substantlesse a shade Appearde in sight, on which they all did gaze, Whose bended browes an inwarde griefe did blaze: This shadowe seemde with all her might in vaine, To turne the wheele where mankinde doth remaine. On toppe whereof Minerua hath her place, A glorious seat by which but one did sit, and hee not knowne, princes of royal race about the sides in place for them most fit, A godly youth and of a worthie wit Was plast with them, whose mothers due desart Quite from the wheele had laid her downe apart. Alecto then, the breader of debate Though pale, and wane yet blewe with ruthfull rage, Fie fortune fie (quoth she) fie on thy state, A goddesse? no, thou wart in elder age, Contemned nowe of plowman, prince and page, No homage done, honour, nor sacrifice, Come take reuenge of this contempt, arise, By nature I all happinesse doe hate, The giftes I giue are bitter griefes like gall, Hate, spight, malice, and madnesse, staie my state, With these I dayly doe deuise to thrall All such as sit aloft in stately stal: My pleasure is the fortunate to foyle, All my delight is in their speedie spoyle. With mightie arme to turne this wheele make hast: Let them belowe aboue in blisse remaine, My gorgeous Galathea is disgrast, Whom to aduance I toyle as yet in vaine, Of thee, and to thy grace shee doth complaine: Heare her at last, and let her not for aye By due desart be drowned in decay. But fortunes force was now of none auaile, When vices vilde to caue of cruell care Doe cast, her power then can not preuaile: When godly life, and vertues very rare, When they aduaunce, what fickle fortune dare molest such one, whom God in highest place hath set, whose steps be guided by his grace. Alecto lewd the hater of good hap when she perceiude dame fortunes feeble force, Shee made about and spide a second gap wherein shee leapt, O Pluto take remorse on vs she said, with voice hollow and hoarce: Shee sits thou sest in highest dignitie, which doth destroy thy mightie monarchie. The worlde thou knowest, I all the worlde was thine, Thy caues were cramd, when heauen all emptie was, Blinde ignorance that mighty mother mine shee ruld, shee rainde, she brought it so to passe That all was thine, euen shee maintaind the masse, And shee it was which gaue the triple crowne To him of Rome, of more then Ironia. muche renowme. But now, (not from Apollos learned braine) Out from the stocke of Mars is sprong a maide, Who doth both him, and thee, and mee disdaine, Thou sest by her thy kingdome is decayd, Thou sest her force, her fame can neuer fade, True knowledge shortly so shall stuffe the heauen, That all thy state shal stand at sixe and seuen. Quoth Pluto tell my Metropolitan, To no such end he hath his princely place, Hee keepes the keyes, his might may blisse or ban, Yet dothe hee see and suffer this disgrace, Tell him from mee I him and all his race will quite destroy except he doth pluck down, All suche as bee rebellers to my crowne. Thus did the Diuell with patience replie, But wh? the Pope had heard his princes minde, His heauie hearte in raging wrath did frie, In hast, post hast a counsaile hee assignde: Bals balling Priestes (not only bald but blinde,) From euery coast in flockes like Coutes they came, Thus spake the woolfe clad like a simple lambe. My ghostly care with mercie mixt too muche, Hath brought contempt, cursing shall nowe preuaile: This stubborne wretched wicked worlde is such. Nowe punishment and whippes of bitter bayle: They must and shall refourme, I will not faile, To plucke them downe with vengeance ruthfull reed: Which doe denie mee to bee supreme head. Haue I the power to curse, to blisse, to binde, To lose, to send to heauen or els to hel? Or is this key and triple crowne assignde To me, to suffer them thus to rebell? No no, I will subdue them very well: To Fraunce, to mightie Spaine, to Italie I Britane giue, Scotlande, and Germanie. Whose princes proud are fled from former faith, And doe deuise to rob mee of the rest, When as my state was at the hiest haigth Then happie he who with my toe was blest, Then all was mine from the'st vnto the west, Then on the backes of Emperours I trode? Then who but I, there was none other God. But nowe alas I liue in lowe degree, A woman doth mee and my might defie, The Gospel nowe my mortall enemie By meanes of her is preacht both farre and nie: As it reuiues, so I your pope doe die: As I do droupe, so you your selues must mourne, Looke well heereto before you be forlorne. This carefull court in haste it did deuise, It sent forth sectes, it traytors did retaine, Those rebels fled for feare which faine woulde rise, It made them practise matters vilde and vaine, Alectos Galathia did complayne Whome to aduaunce they haue, they do, and will, On feeble fort such show their slender skill. For as the seas do roare against the rocke In vaine, and windes no mountaines maie remooue, So there at Rome these forcelesse priestes did flock None of their popish practizes would proue, Which did so much that mightie monster moue, As straight he did a holie league conclude, Meaning by might the Gospel to detrude. Then Galathea presently was blest, If he may blesse who coulde nor can not curse, Hee made a shorte and yet the marke he mist, Hee stretcht the stringes of his plentifull purse In vaine, and all in vaine hee did disburse His Peterpence, all thinges had such successe, As well deserude his worships worthinesse. Which made him clap a loofe hooke to his saile, Peter put on his considering cappe, A fruitelesse flower passing poore &amp; pale: Without or smell, or tast, or sence, or sappe, A hidden hooke, a traine, a secrete trappe, Away the witch, the windes were not to scant, The fleete was rigde, and yet there was a want. Then from that borde he cast his sayles about, He did and doth an other drift deuise, Alecta with her stobourne seruauntes stoute Doth further forth his diuelishe enterprise, With false report to euery coaste she flies And filles the eares of euerie king with ire Against her grace to make them all conspire. The present gods seeing this great turmoile, Made haste with speede her person to defende, Saide Saturne let vs keepe her from the foile, This wicked world shee all her force doth bend To sinke such as by vertue woulde ascend. This is (said Mars) a valiant troupe I trowe: which dare attempt one womans ouerthrowe. And doth the diuell and he his depute there? Doe kinges consult, and furies fierce of hell, My daughter from her hie estate to teare? Dare they against both Ioue and vs rebell? O hie deuise, their courage doth excell: They faine woulde frame the ouerthrowe of one which must and shall remaine when they are gone, Whose pride, but first their rage we will resist, Menacing Mars with eyes like flaming fire, His face showde what was shrowded in his brest: He made all that were present to admire At his reuenge, and dare they thus conspire? They will (quoth hee) and I will doe the deede which shall preuaile, when shee shall stande in neede. Pallas with secrete suddaine ioy reuiude, Forgetting quite her griefes foretunne shee saide, Attende and heare the song I haue contriude, Giue eare you gods, lende me your louing ayde Apollo thou the best that euer plaide Take Lute in hand, tune to the waters fall, Minerua liues, whom Pallas honor shall. Farewell you kinges of all the continent both farre and neare, Against both gods, and goodnes you be bent with sworde and speare, Therefore with you the furies fierce of hell, We with the vertuous English Queene will dwell, she can not slide for we will side Her steppes, and make her fame excel. For true report with golden trumpe doth sounde her worthie prayse: But your reproch by rumour doth rebounde in the hie wayes Of all the worlde, so you in infamie Must liue, and shee in royall dignitie: howe can shee fade whom vertue made The greatest godesse by degree. Reioyce you gods to sing we will not cease, nowe we haue founde The chiefest place of rest and quiet peace vpon the grounde. For we shall sit euen by her seemely side, Whose mightie mase the golden world doth gide; so worthie a Queene was neuer seene, VVhose heauenly state shall neuer slide. From striking of his stringes Apollo stayde, VVhich brought this suddaine ende to Pallas song, His Lute laide downe hee thus vnto them saide, As wee be godes, so let vs do no wrong, you knowe the charge which doth to vs belong, Howe mightie Ioue the onely god aboue VVould vs on earth showe whom he best doth loue. If Pallas and the tried trueth doth proue The English Queene of all most worthie prayse, Then may wee boldely boast that God doth loue Her best, if most shee walketh in his wayes, VVhich if to proue make we no more delayes But let vs hence, for we with her will dwell If such shee be, if so shee doth excell. Then her we may and will immortall make, A goddesse great Minerua be her name, My Mercury hee shall him selfe betake To all the worlde, and there he shall proclame Both farre and neare her due deserued fame: All men that liue her grace they shall adore Both at this present time, and euermore. Quoth Pallas let it be as you haue saide, wee will depart, yet doubt not of the dame, Shee is by proofe and oracle displayde, Most certainelie I knowe shee is the same: And I before I hence depart, will frame A comely Coronet of goodly greene, which shall right well become a maiden Queene. And wee saide they will breake downe Floras bower Yeelding thereto the floweres of the fielde: Syluanus then stept from his stately towre, And I thereto such branches braue will yeelde (Saide hee,) as hath been seene but verie sielde, Of woodes, of groues, of goodly greene the god I am, you knowe they bowe if I but nod. Though hatefull Hyems wasting winters rage, With bitter blastes my tender bowes doth bite: Yet friendly Ver her rigor doth aswage, And all my groues with goodly greene doth dight: The modest Muses flocke for their delight Amidst my greene, they daily march for meede, They sing, they daunce, they there, their fancies feede. VVithin my groues such sacred trees doe growe As neuer will their louely greene forgoe, Them on your goddesse garlande I'le bestowe, Not onely them, but many flowres moe, Hearbes of all sortes if you will haue it so. Quoth Neptune, pearles and precious stones great store I will supplie, what woulde Pallas haue more. Then forth they went and gathered all was good, Great mightie bowes and branches home they brought, they did disgrace eche forrest, fielde, and wood. Neptune returnd who had his Indies sought, From thence he Iewels which were neuer bought For price, nor pay, they were so passing rare: To order all Pallas had all the care. Dame Flora with her nimble Nymphes came in, Euen there they did their louely lappes vnlade, And in her hande the prettie fairie Queene Shee helde a glasse, these flowres shall not fade, Them to preserue this water I haue made: They shall not die, nor droup, but florish faire, Nor feele the force of Sommers swelting aire. The Muses ix. ix. colours did present Of sowing silke vntwined yet in twist, To sowe, to weaue, to binde was their intent where need requirde, then with her faire fist A Morian maide when shee the place had blist, Chrystall, Currall, Amber, Bugle shee Laide downe, and saide these for your gerland be. The Graces called Charites came in, Two bagges, the third shee did a bottel beare, In which full twentie seueral roomes there bin All filde with water delicate and deare, Distilled all: and in the bagges there were Muske, Mirre, Siuit, and Ambergreece the best That hath bin seene, from th'est vnto the west, They all as one imploide their second care More busie then the birde which buildes her nest, To take the choice whose vertues were most rare, They litle slippes and branches of the best Did bring, they left and laide away the rest: Pallas her selfe did worke this worthie wreath most passing braue aboue, and braue beneath. Ix. noble worthies mightie Mars they prayde To passe with him to please their chiefe delight: Vij. sages then they thus to Saturne saide wee will with thee to see this worthie wight: Three Marriners indude with deepe insight Of seamans skill, worthie to frame a course where Neptune was in spight of Eols force: A learned troupe vnto Apollo prest, Of which were two inseparable seemde, Silenus, tho like mouners, yet the best Theologi by deedes and doctrine deemd, to him they went, of him they were esteemde: To garnishe Pallas worke with greater grace, By them eche branch and flower had her place. The Firre tree first her branch they did forbid, For it doth speares and warlike weapons make, The Oliues branch (whose vertue lieth hid) It hates, his rootes doe growe from Limbo lake, The mourning Cyprus bowe they did forsake: The first with redde, but that with black they bounde For them (from this) an other vse was founde. The Flower deluce though louely to beholde In question these the wisest did it call, And to refuse the same the gods were bolde: It representes trouble and cruell thrall, The leaues like swoordes do grow both tough &amp; tall, The roote though pleasant, poison is to such As doe it drinke, which made the Muses grutch. These thence for secrete cause they cast away, As too too bad to haue their being there, This comely crewe did solemnize that day, And Pallas made her perfite skill appeare, The Nymphes, and Ladies of the fountaines cleare More busie then a swarme of bees, they brought In laden armes such thinges as they had sought. A Pantarbe strange of great &amp; goodly sise, with workemanship as rare as was the stone, Shee there the first foundation did deuise, Grene grasse shee strowde a handfull thereupon, Trefoiles, Cincquefoiles, and caterfoiles among, The chosen slips of the Pomegranet tree, These bound with blacke, with white those did agree, whose secrete sence Libethrides did sing, whilst Dryades did other flowers bring. VVithin the Salamanders head a precious stone is founde, Of value rich, of vertue rare, none such vpon the grounde: VVho doth possesse the same, may stande vnhurt in flame of fiers force with fame. Nor Cupids might Can hurt such one with spight, Thrice happie wight VVho hath the Pantarbe found. Grasse is greene common like corne, yet doth it farre surmount, For only grasse maintaineth man, and is of chiefe account. The Romane Captaines wore garlandes thereof of yore, because they did restore the quiet peace, and made the warres surcease. A great increase it plainely doth present, The Primerose or Caterfoile first in the prime doth spring, It is the messenger to May of wilde flowers the king: Who first it findes must note his mistres by her Her colours coat, It growes like true loue knot, and doth present shee neuer will repent her voude intent, happie who first it findes. The Cincquefoiles sanctitie is such, the Gentiles did applie It chieflly in their sacrifice when they did purifie, In it nine colours bin, but chiefly white and greene the colours of a Queene, it doth declare The wearer hath great care with vertue rare to keepe her soule from sinne. The Trefoile hath his secrete sense, the vnitie of three It doth declare, and is in league with the Pomegranet tree: Cupid that braunch did beare, Whose hand with cruel speare Eche louers heart doth teare, it doth present All flesh to loue is bent, and must repent their losse of libertie. Thus though eche Ladie needes must loue and seeke for vnitie, Yet shee who doth the Pantarbe finde shall liue at libertie: With her reason shall rest, Fancie shall bilde no nest Within her blessed brest, the great increase of perfit loue, and peace, shall neuer cease, VVhere these flowers be worne. You happie Hamadryades nowe presse you out a pace, Bring foorth what best may beautifie the seconde ranke or race: This worke is well begunne, For wee our parts haue done, Now you must thither runne, in Pallas lap You must your flowers wrap, Mineruas cap Shee wil therewith adorne. Two branches then of euerlasting wood, which neuer will corrupt nor waste away, But euer greene, their sauour passing good, They doe declare her fame cannot decay VVhich doth them weare, by due desart I say Pallas them plast, and gaue the next degree Vnto the Cedar and Geniper tree. A thousand orient pearles shee hangde thereon, For white with greene will euer well agree, Sweete VVilliams then shee placed them among, And Lauinder for liberalitie: For her good workes, a braunche of Sauorie, Al these the worthie woodbind did imbrace: The Honisuckle gaue a greater grace Vnto them all, whose braunch with chrystall dight, Did muche increase the beholders delight. The Double Dill for her humilitie, Laustibi (health) the Affodill doth shewe, The Oking braunche her diuturnitie, And thereuppon did golden Acornes growe In comely knopps, hanging in seemely rowe: To furnishe these shee set a slip of sage For sustinance, all anger to aswage Next this shee gentle Gezemen did place, And thrifte she tide within our Ladies lace. Pallas a comely Carbuncle did take, whose royall rayse were bright like Phœbus beames, A triple towred toppe shee ment to make Thereon, for well she wist the glittering gleames Thereof did shine with goodly stately streames, And leand vnto the lookers on such light, That they might iudge of euery thing aright. And when shee had the hearbe Alimon founde, Alaluya by and by shee spide, The Larkesfoote fast with white to Burnet bounde, Dictamum she to Peneryall tyde, with goodly greene shee made them all abide: And beare the branche whose tender twigges did bend, with golden fruite as though their rine would rende: About the Lillies stalke Hearts ease was wrapt, And loue within our Ladies smock shee lapt. The pretie Pincke, the goodly Marie golde, Muske Roses mixt with seemely Sops in wine, Sweete Violets, of colours manifolde, The gentle Gylly flower florisht fine, Rosemary tide vnto a little Time, with Basell, Balme, I sope sweete Margerie, These were intrayld with branche of Rasper tree. Euen then shee did the double Daseye downe with blewe shee bounde it to the Laurell tree: The little Pauncie greatest of renowme, Cornations came with great humilitie, Doing vnto sweete Eglintine dutie: And then a branch of Palme with goodly grace, Her spreading spraise did beautifie the place. From hiest top out of one stately stemme Two royall Roses white and redde did growe, The Oliue tree most brauely grew by them, And by their rootes were set in seemely rowe Flowers and hearbes whose names I doe not knowe: Pallas her comely Casket did vnlocke, Before her face the Muses all did flocke. The Redrose first with precious pearles they dight, The white rose they inritch with rubies rare, Their stalke with Azure Saphires garnisht bright A secrete hidden vertue did declare, The Oliues goodly branches were not bare, For all her twigges with Emeraulds did bende, The Smarage did the Oliues greene amend. Of Topazes two sortes there haue bin founde, One sort like golde this garnisht Eglintine, Not on but by the Pauncie most renowmde, The other much more greene then grasse did shine, (By due desart the Ardonix is thine:) Thou doutie double Dayseie for thy tree The Daintie Diamon doth well agree. The other hearbes with Margarites were mixt, And heere and there did hang an Amatest, And euerie where a Iasynth betwixt Them both, and comely Chrystall to the rest, With guled Currall, Bugle of the best, Spangles of golde and siluer there were seene, All these set foorth dame Chloris goodly greene. The Fayrie Queene did season this with sweet, And when she had consarude it in such wise, As neither Brumas blastes, nor Atumns heate Coulde hurte, shee did with all her wit deuise, From euery branche a sweete perfume did rise, The flowers did retaine their proper smell, Quoth Pallas stay, this worke is passing well. Diana and her daintie damsels did Their friendly fingers vndefiled frame, When sacred solemne rites were finished, To beare being whithout or blot or blame Vnto her grace who was of greatest fame This rare deuise, with double dignitie Meauing to crowne Mineruas maiestie. The Poets Pince, and Harauldes chiefest king Mightie Palaphilos you might persaue To place ech one appointing euerie thing As it shoulde bee; the gods were bounsing braue, No goddesse there, no muse nor Nymphs was graue, All did with ioyfull Iubilie reioyce Shouting Minerua liues with often voyce. Then might you see the rurall dames come in, The youth like frie, olde folke like foules did flocke: With bags and baskits filde vp to the brimme, For Fauni did the Forrest gates vnlocke: And simple Cate clad in a russet frocke Brought branches thence, and flowers aporne full, The waies were woods made by the gadding scull, Apollo tooke in hand his pleasant Lute, And hee his Harp who said Euridicen, Thales did force with louely lippes her Flute, Calliope on Sitarne did begin, Melpomene on Viall prayse did winne, The Napeæ with the Nayades They did deuise and singe thes sweete ditties. The Nymphes and Ladies of the lake, Perfourme this great solemnitie All for their new Mineruas sake noble Naiades. And where renowmed Napeæ Is shee who doth deserue such fame? In England now Naiades, Elizabeth her name. With flant a flant this flanting flocke, The greatest goddesse by degree, They meane that maiden Queene to make with royall dignitie. Thither goe all this faire flocke with such so great solemnitie, All for their newe Mineruas sake noble Naiades. Thus they at last were come where Lud had laid Though not the first, foundations long before, VVhere then this courtly maiden Queene she staide With all her traine, and manie straingers more For then there were Ambassadors great store: Whom to delight, the people did prepare Triumphes, perfourmde with courage passing rare. The court it selfe none such my selfe haue seene In Fraunce, in Spayne, nor curious Italie, The courtiers, first the beautie of the Queene, Her goodly grace, her garments what they bee, No Empresse can make such showe as shee, For gold, for pearle, for precious stones of price, No one like her for robes of rare deuise. Then from the prince vnto the porest page, The worste in silke, the best in cloth of golde Richly inricht, the noble man so sage, The gentleman so ciuell to beholde, The courteous seruingman the boy though bolde, Yet he and they eche one in his degree, Did plainely proue him selfe ciuilitie. When Titans beames had banisht Lunas light And duskish dim which dide the day with darke, Sent foorth from fame report that worthie wight, With trompet shrille made heauen and earth to harke, Immortall gods and mortall men did marke The message which with great solemnitie, was thus declarde to all of each degree. The sheuered staues will well declare the minde Of them who heere this day will showe their might, An Earle by birth and of an noble kinde His chalenge will perfourme euen in despight Of him or them which dare withstande in fight, Therefore you Brutes which would inrich your name Cast armour one and trie the Tilte for fame. The Mertials and the Iudges had their place, The Harraldes prest to pen eche due desart, The Queene was come, there waited on her grace A hundred Ladies beautifull and braue, The forraine princes and her counsaile graue, When all the showe and euery thing was seene No colours cold compare with white and greene. The challenger proudly presumde to say That white and greene had not the brauest hewe, But that his Maistris bore the bell away: Her courtly colours were most worthie vewe Hee saide and swore, wherewith the trumpets blewe, The splents of speares which climde the cloudes aboue Did well declare the force of mightie loue. A Fierce defendant with a counter buffe Of this proud chalenger did chaunge the cheere, Spight of his force and all his cootes of proffe He made him leaue the fielde for feeble feare, Assistantes three forthwith there did appeare, The first did well, the second in his place, So did the thirde but for this one disgrace. In Helmet for the honour of his deare The Ladie whom they all did most commend, Her gallant plume and colours he did weare, Which for her sake like life he did defende: Yet force perforce, them to the ground did sende: And then the people cride God saue the Queene, No colours can compare with white and green. Therewith the cloud which did the gods inclose That they might walke, and see, and not be seene, Was quit with drawne, the people did suppose Heauen was broke loose, so might the royall Queene, So did the court, so all the worlde might deeme, The armed knightes the people in a traunce Did muse, and makt the order of this chaunce. First Saturne and vii. sages past before, Then mightie Mars with him ix. worthies went, Neptune he had three saylers and no more, Apollo Castor and Pollux. two for a learned intent, Silenus Preachers. v. all v. from heauen were sent, Then Mercury the ruler Fame. of report, Thus these vi. gods entred into the court. Next these dame Floras noble Nymphes came in, The Fayerie Queene, and Ladies of the lake, Diana and her Damsels then were seene, A troupe which did to chastitie betake Themselues, come thither for Mineruas sake, There Pallas and the learned Muses staid, And Pallas thus vnto Minerua sayd. Most mightie prince almightie Ioue the iust Would vs on earth showe whom he best doth loue, We haue inquirde, and nowe it is discust It is thy selfe, whom he who sittes aboue Hath so inricht that thou canst not remoue, From that which with his will doth well agree, Being of all the best felicitie. Nowe sith we see thy goodly gouernment, And finde howe passing straight thy steps do stand, We all be come, all wee for this intent To liue with thee, to bee at thy commande, And for that cause Pallas and all her bande, Doth heere resigne vnto thy worthie will Their worldly wit, and all their learned skill, Thy due desert hath thee Minerua made A goddesse great, with whom none can compare, For hee of heauen hath set it downe and said, The Britttain Queene shalbe that Phœnix rare, Whom death to touch with dart shall neuer dare: Thou shalt on earth eternally remaine As I haue done, though greater be thy gaine. Beholde these gods all readie to resigne The giftes for which they were eternized, Receiue thou them because they be all thine, Receiue also vnto thy heauenly head This Corronet, this garlande garnished Not like thy minde with gifts of greatest price, But as we coulde inricht with rare deuise, Shee thus adornd with double dignitie They did of mortall her immortall make, As thus shee sat amidst such maiestie The lookers on with louing feare did shake, Her goodly grace did make the gods to quake: The Muses then and all the people said thy due desert hath thee Minerua made. And then the Queene with more then mortall grace, The life (quoth shee) of euery liuing thing Must perish quite, for death will it deface: But death to death by due desert to bring Such death on earth is life euerlasting, I knowe right well such immortalitie you haue obtainde, and such remaines for me. And then forth from the slender suttel skies All Angellike there did a shape appeare, Euen as it is of ghosts deuine the gise A heauenly humane forme shee did on there: And yet shee was as Tytans beames so cleare, Immaculate not hauing spot of sinne, All clad in white thus did her grace begin. Within this worlde at last is one who hath inricht her name with euerlasting fame, This Ladie only shee alone shee shall inioy the same: the goddesses diuine, and all the Muses ix. to her they shall resigne: Because the due desartes which them immortal made This Ladie hath obtaind, her fame shall neuer fade. Proceed my Muse assist thy seruaunt nowe, Able his penne to publishe forth her praise Whose life is like dame Sinthias siluer rayse. That mightie God of heauen Ioua great, He doth permit, his highnes doth alowe Vnto her grace all earthly blesse shall bowe, And bide, and bee at her commaundement, With perfit blesse to beautifie her seate, Euen for that cause Euthumia is sent. With her this goddesse euermore shall stay, Then thus bespake blessed Euthumia. Goddesse of great accompt whose due desert doth farre surmount the peoples prayse, in no such wayse did euer woman walke: Faire Ladie sweet with thee, with thee I meane to talke, Talke and resigne to thee, euen to thy selfe my state, of all the world most fortunate, whose happines with perfit blesse is furnished, nowe I must dwell with thee, because thou doest excell. Thy vertues rare Do well declare To what thou art inclinde, The worthines of woman kinde, Thou dost approue that sexe is such As doth mankinde exceed, exceedeth man by much, By muche and moste of all, of all the royall reste, Thy perfite greate estate is beste, Thy birth right great, greater thy fame, Euthumias noble name I yeelde to thee my dignitie. Thy due deserued right, in deede thy right rewarde Rewarded by the gods, for when the gods had harde In what a perfit path you tread, And howe your life you leade, They did ordaine Mee to remaine With her whose state Was fortunate, So sent from them to you, to you, onely to you I bowe, And bende, and bind my selfe, my selfe vnto your will, Your wil? that is my worke, my worke that to fulfill. Sweet Eglintine shall haue the place, And notice of thy name, Which flowre to defend, euen to defende the same, Of passing pusiant power In hiest throne Hee which doth sit, he shall defende thee from thy fone, and so preserue the seate, the seat where thou dost sit, as neither hatreds heate not wicked wit, shall bloot thy goodnes with disgrace, amongst the gods thou shalt remaine for euermore. Aglaia most like the morning starre that godesse next Euthumia did appeare, none of the muses might with her compare, muche like her selfe shee found Minerua there: Suche beutie, bountie, personage and grace, Greatlie amazde she pausde a prettie space: Apollo then did downe his mightie mace, He thus describd the fauour of her face. Like newe refined golde Queene Hellens haire, Shee hath the browes of blissed Brissis braue, Egerias ere, shee hath Egestas eare, Chionis cheeke, and Chloris goodly grace, Neeras nose on fayre Venus face, The tongue of Telesilla, Tethis teeth, And Ledas lippes to lende louely reliefe. Of modest Myrta milde the smiling cheere, Dame Floras breth so sweet as violet, Clitias chin, like Collitina cleare, The necke of Nemesis, Doris, or Eudora, Her brests be braue like Diopeia, Shee is of all the worlde the brightest starre, Begot by Mars the mightie god of warre. Apollo staide, Aglaia did proceede Though much amazde to see ast'were her self, Aglaias eyes they on her face did feede, And coulde not satisfie themselues with sight, There was containd in it so great delight: Yet at the last her wordes did well display Her inwarde thought, thus did the Ladie say. Lady of all delight Delight of Ladies all, All the most worthie wight Most worthie wight they shall, Shall they? They shall in deed, Indeed, adore thy name, Thy name wth euerlasting fame. Fame flie thou foorth with speede, VVith speede let it be knowne to all vnder the Sunne, The Sun hath shinde vp? none such since first the world begun. To whom Aglaia doth resigne, For new Mineruas prayse doth shine More bright then heretofore did mine: VVith all a flaunt a flaunt, Thou as thou shouldst dost vaunt, The Gods of heauen doe graunt Thee euermore their heauenly grace, To prosper thee in euerie place. That goodly goddesse great renowmed Clytia she prest into the presse, th? thus the dame diuine did say, Braue Besse how are delights Of beauties brauest bright Plast in thy passing perfect personage, Stand foorth you worthie wights Beholde you heere in sight, The chiefest glorie of this present age: Vnto this gallant gay Doth worthie Clytia her name and fame resigne, All glory hath beene mine, All glory nowe is thine, With glory thou dost shine, so like the seemly Sunne, Braue Besse shal be thy name when al the world is done. Next her appeard a muse of great degree, And thus bespake comelie Calliope, A Ladie like my selfe at last, at last my selfe haue founde, that shee may be renowmde: Fame telles her name with busie blast To all vpon the ground: The sweetnesse of her voice Doth make the gods reioyce, Therefore Calliope To little Englands worthie Queene Doth giue her great degree. And then the Graces called Charytes With these speeches did all the people please: Amidst a gallant gardine greene, Where natures worthiest worke is seene, Impald with perfect blisse, Wherein one forme our selues haue founde All the good graces on the grounde, Euen there our biding is, With mery mindes wee there remaine, The place doth please vs so, It neuer shall bee seene nor saide, That wee from thence will goe: As foode feedes mortall fleshe, Euen so our mindes doe eate The perfect pleasures there doe grow, Most meete for Angels meate: Dido that courtly Carthage Queene, Of Troyes decay that fine Helen And gallant Venus gay, Iuno nor Pallas neuer dare, Diana chaste may not compare, With mightie Minerua For shee hath that which all they had, In much more perfect plight Then minde of man imagine may, Or Dittie can indight: VVe vaunt not then in vaine, For only wee are blest VVho doe inioy of all the worlde the very worthiest: Inioy? wee only doe possesse The highest haight of happinesse, Therefore wee will reioyce, For where all vertue doth remaine Euen shee who all the rest doth staine is made our only choyce. And this to you of heauen we vowe, whilst you her life do lend Only with her we will remaine, our faith shall her defend, her becke wee will obey, I shee shall haue our heart, and we with her wil runne and ride wee neuer will depart. On earth heauenly felicitie euen heere on earth not one but wee, and wee haue found the place, VVhere euery perfect sweete delight doth rest, and doth remaine by right: wee doe the branche imbrace, whose buds the blossomes bee of blisse, whose fruite Ambrosia, God keepe Minerua from mishap, God keepe her from decay, For with that goddesse greate wee doe possesse our place, And wee will dwell for euermore in her most faire face. Then Clio sister to Calliope, That modest mery Muse of great degree, Found out this Queene who had her goodly grace, shee all her giftes and goodnes did imbrace, Whome longe she did with maruell muche beholde, Thus shee at last her fancies did vnfolde. Macthlesse for musick once I was, none could my note come neere, nowe thou dost passe, thy voyce most cleere From healtfull lights and lounges belowe doth send, Such sweete and pleasant harmonie, The gods their eares doe bende, And after thee we see The rest of all the Muses run, to gaze vpon thy grace, Which as they do behold they finde, thy mothers faire face, to thee I Clio heere Doe giue eternitie, Thou noble Nymphe that hast no peere, Thy name and fame shall liue and neuer fade, The onely peece of worke that euer nature made Thus shee who once was but a mortall Queene, And subiect sate on fortunes turning wheele, The greatest goddesse nowe on earth is seene: Whose hie estate can neither roule nor reele, Nor fortunes force shall neuer hurt her heele: For vertue did and due desart aduaunce Her grace, and not the force of changing chance, Shee is not nowe as other princes bee, Who liue on earth to euery tempest thrall, Desert hath crownde her with eternitie, Her godly zeale in seate sempiternal Hath set her nowe, from thence shee can not fall: But liuely liue on earth eternally: And haue in heauen heauenly felicitie. Therewith this curious court brake vp, and I in ragged rime Was made the trumpet to their talk, the touchstone of the time. Amongst the gods there is none like thee O Lorde, There is none can do as thou doest. Psal. Lxxxvi. The Pilgrimes post scrip. Euermore my Muse shall magnifie thy name Most gracious, most right renowned dame Nowe that I knowe thy due deserued fame: most mightie prince the meanes thou hast made that all the world doth knowe howe vertue like a sea doth flowe in thee, and howe thou doest forslake the bitter bent of cruell Cupides bowe, free fro the force of fancies flashing flame, Most gratious, most right renowned dame Nowe that I knowe thy due deserued fame, Euermore my Muse shall magnifie thy name: first with thy wit who can compare, thy vertuous inclination is knowne to euery nation, thy learning and thy gifts most rare make perfite declaration nature thy equall neuer yet did frame. Nowe that I knowe thy due deserued fame Euermore my Muse shall magnifie thy name, Most gracious, most right renowned dame. Your Maiesties poore pilgrime, Thomas Blener Hasset. Heere endeth the first booke of the reuelation of the true Minerua.</field>
