      <field name="fulltext">????? ????? ????? ????? ????? ?????????? DEDICATION, ADDRESSED TO THE LEARNED CHARACTERS OF MY POEM. Guy's Porridge Pot ARGUMENT. APPEAL to the reader's feelings—disadvantages under which modern poets must labour—evil spirits of literature.—The author's security and courage—he defies and threatens them.— Poetical impediments removed in the usual manner—Hints at the subject.—Why the evil spirits cannot interfere.—Cautions given them not to transgress their proper limits.—Address to the reader—Author's prudence—that prudence necessary.—Hints— Allusion to an important subject—Hints again—The scene of this Poem discovered—distinguishing peculiarities of it—Great natural phenomenon—Learned allusion in explanation—A beautiful contrast in the characteristic description of some very good, and some very wise people.—Preparations for the conclusion— Reader's impatience—Author's prudence—Illuminati—Conclusion. BOOK I. “Double, double toil and trouble Fire, burn; and, cauldron, bubble.” Those that have tried, alone can pity His case who must be, will be witty, Who sweats with labor, shakes with doubt, And writes a line to scratch it out. The time is past since folk beginning Had got a muse to set them spinning. And when their first, their only prayer Was said to her, and she was there— Now hungry, cross-grained, grim reviewer, The golden age of literature was antecedent to criticism. The silver, when it was scarce. This is the iron, brazen, and leaden age. How happily would poor persecuted authors go on, if it were not for critical torments! I wish sincerely—and not on my own account—that Reviewers would give them a jubilee year, and pass an act of indemnity; an act of oblivion would be useless presently, for all offences therein committed. Sticks man with pen, as hare with skewer: No force withstands, no tear appeases, He does, and will do what he pleases; And giant-like where'er he meets him He turns, he bastes, he roasts, he eats him. But spells secure, lest fiend attack it With brimstone brush my fire-proof jacket— When fierce, I'm wrath—when sharp, uncivil, Saint Dunstan I, if he the devil. (So far, so good, now rest a little, My metaphor gets plaguy brittle: Better go slowly, better stay Till sure to find the straightest way.) If culprit I, if justice he His warrant cannot reach to me; All armed in brass, like stout knight-errant, Care I for justice or for warrant? And when I laugh at men or flatter, Is he a judge of praise or satire? Can he decide the cause between The author me, and those I mean Both sides unknown, unheard, unseen? To him who boldly soaring sings These metaphors are awkward things; Use all the caution that he may They get for ever in his way: Though changed, alas! mine is not plain So now I change it back again. I tell thee critic, those same people, Far off, live round provincial steeple. Who interferes while I am firking With all my might a neighbour's jerkin? Myself, my neighbour both unknown, What prudent man would risk his own? Goblin avaunt; I give thee warning To hang thy tail, and draw thy horn in! But gentle tender-hearted reader Our road is plain while I am leader, In spite of critic, wind, or weather, We chit-chat jog along together, If that be chit-chat tete-a-tete Si rixa est, ubi tu pulsas, ego vapulo tantum. Juv. Where you must listen, I must prate. I would, but dare not half unravel Cause why, place where, with whom, you travel. (Reader)“You dare not?” (Author)Hush! I give the reason Some folks have knives, and I a weason! Still one is bold, the other pressing, And no great secret learnt by guessing; I tell my tale about the people— (Reader)“What people?” (Author)Guess, and guess what steeple. (Reader)“They Mr. Malthus, Mr. Godwin, &amp;c. prove, who dread a want of vittle Great Britain to be very little: Take Scotland from it, he who searches May yet find room for many churches!” (Author)Take Scotland then, and solve my riddle, This place stands somewhere near the middle. (Reader)“I cannot guess.” (Author) Alas! Alas! poor Yorick! That scull had a tongue in it once. Ham. poor Yorick! Thy scull had brains!(Reader)“What is it—? (Author) Yes—, Fortune crazy creature, Has there reversed the laws of nature. Plat. Tim.—Lact. Inst.—Plat.—Arist. de Anim. Fire, air, and water lose in force The more, the farther from their source, As any man or child can tell us Who squirts with squib, or blows with bellows. But there, so freakish is the dame, The beams shine brighter than the flame: However strange my tale my sound I shall dwell longer on this part of my subject hereafter. There are, notwithstanding this general character which I have given, many individuals resident among the crowd, who deserve to be elevated above their neighbours. It is usual indeed to pay this compliment twice in every year, but much too partially. In the second part of my poem, if I have sufficient encouragement to continue it, I will do what I can for them. Neither have I any apprehensions but that sufficient encouragement will be given me. Some of those whom I am now describing, will be grateful enough to return the compliment, as well as they can, either by themselves or their friends. I expect every acknowledgment which critical modesty can offer me. And if my readers should meet in the different Reviews, notwithstanding my caution, with such words as these, fool, ass, knave, monster, &amp;c. let them remember how to read and construe all and each into the most delicate and refined expressions of approbation. Clouds rest within, and light around. I must explain, I see you doubt, Wisdom hath placed her sons without. As once philosophers, we know, Declared the sun was ice or snow. The people laughed, the dog-days came, They sought the shade, but held the same: What can be done? at last they venture To prove its rays unlike its centre. And thus with ? ?, in the smoke Dwell civil, quiet, decent folk— This should not have been said perhaps, without some few honourable exceptions. Even here there are certain little insects in literature who differ as much from the hero of my poem as a butterfly from an eagle; or as the hyssop on the wall, from the cedar of Lebanon. A love of reputation may burn as intensely in dwarfs as in giants, in the people of Lilliput as in the people of Brobdingnag. Numberless pretty little namby-pamby verses almost every week, which have no other essential fault but a want of sense and poetry, are from this origin. One unfortunate pygmy, who is lost, rashly launched into the literary ocean with a cockle-shell tragedy: others have more prudently confined themselves to the republication of their neighbours works, in a newspaper, with three or four introductory lines written by themselves. There are little Betty's in scribbling here who dispute the laurel with their two Reverend Instructors, and carry it away. In fact, authors which criticism must examine with the same microscopic minuteness as naturalists would do mites in a cheese, abound; but I, who am speaking of the cheese itself, may give a distinct and appropriate character, notwithstanding these its insignificant and almost imperceptible inhabitants. But all the learned, wise, and bright Live further off, live out of sight. Now reader! never mind the first, They eat through hunger, drink through thirst: And not alone from wants like these, They eat and drink just when they please— Like me, and, possibly, like you, But still, as I said before, there are some few honourable exceptions, some few instances of an ambitious spirit. I shall relate other particulars hereafter, at present I must content myself with the following.—One good citizen—alas! I am forced to acknowledge he was an adventitious citizen—fell before the mayor upon his knees, passionately implored the reasonable loan of an alderman's gown, and permission, when invested in that dignified garb, to congratulate his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and his Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence on their happy arrival. It is to be lamented that a request so laudable as this was refused him—not only because the princely guests have lost such an extraordinary specimen of wisdom and eloquence, but also because the disappointed citizen in question has become a victim to that timid and bashful sensibility which generally preys upon repulsed and neglected genius! They do what other people do— And, as I hinted, drink and eat Just what they have, or what they get. Virtues, thank God! not yet uncommon To English-man or English-woman. An empty belly genders strife, But peace reigns here 'twixt man and wife. Without a pistol, gun, or sabre, It must be confessed that this happy repose is occasionally disturbed by a tremendous foe to borough serenity called “Contested Election.” Still, however, there is some strong, though secret, influence, similar to that of gravitation or magnetism which keeps almost every thing here in its proper place. Foolish people, who were ignorant of this influence, might have wondered, perhaps, when they beheld one good man, whose loss is universally regretted, change and re-change his party seven times in less than a month. But it was found, on diligent enquiry, that he had received three different promises of a long lease from Pro, and four invitations to dinner from Con. As Con had also a house to dispose of, Con succeeded. On another occasion, there were silly, childish, half-witted mortals, so totally unacquainted with the world, as to shudder with horror or disgust, on hearing a Reverend Orator publicly attack the son of his former friend and his exhausted patron, though he knew that the accusation was false, and though he saw that the calumny must be refuted! Fortunately, indeed, there are very few who are so squeamish as this: and philosophers, like myself, may trace the power or influence of this same principle, called interest, in its operations, while we are totally ignorant of its nature. Each lives in quiet by his neighbour. Here let us stop, and rest, before I Conclude the wonders of my story.(Reader)“Conclude! whatever may be in it, Before you end, you should begin it.”(Author)Assuage your wrath, your haste assuage, What follows, comes another stage. In tale so very delicate I Acted like wise Illuminati, Who leading, checking, watching, trying, See Prof. Rob. and Ab. Bar.—Hom. Od.—Proclus de Tim. Athæn. Kir. Knew convert fit, from convert prying. He who with modest patience strains To learn, learns wonders for his pains. Before I tell, I make you follow Through brake and fen, o'er steep and hollow. Come on, if still resolved to roam, If weary, prithee Sir go home. The guide is paid—averse or willing— You have your choice, and I the The intended price of this book; but lo! the effects of fine paper!shilling. BOOK II. ARGUMENT. A SOLEMN address to the Spirits by whom I am inspired. Their office—power—dignity—and origin. Why preferable to Apollo and the Muses. Vows of perfect and perpetual devotion to them.—The story, according to Aristotle, abruptly commenced. News—of what—by whom carried—to whom brought—The Hero of the Poem—The elbow chair—The speech—Prediction—Preparations—A beautiful allusion to Homer. The Hero superior, in some respects, to Agamemnon—His predictions accomplished. Conclusion. “Boil thou first in the charmed pot.” Macbeth. Scene—The same till it shifts. Time—The same till it changes. All hail! ye powers of mystic song That nightly loose my stammering tongue; That fire my brain, and fill my soul With visions dim, with nothing whole; That bid misshapen forms arise And stand revealed before mine eyes; That multiply this candle here To girandole or chandelier! All hail! ye powers of every sort Whether ye boast your birth from port, Or, bound to let the truth appear, Blushing confess ye sprang from beer! Thrice I invoke your sacred line Spirits all hail! of beer and wine! Let pale-faced poet, if he chuses, Address Apollo and the muses; Inspired by you, I scorn to follow Either the muses or Apollo. For whispering groves, and gelid springs, And Pindus' tops, and Zephyr's wings, With lists, which poets must remember, Seem out of season in December; Hom. Il.—Anacr.—Pind.—Seneca.—Proper.—Liv. 3 B.— Ovid. Met.—Propert. And all the rocks and woods together May sleep, for me, till warmer weather; Besides I said (prim. vide Tom.) Though called and called they never come. Pindar may strive to make us quarrel Sweet red-nosed spirits of my barrel, But neither he nor Aristotle Parts me from you, or Baby Bottle! News flies as fast as fame can carry That Fox is chosen secretary! Post-office, shambles, bank, and fish-shop, Resound prophetic of a bishop. Happy the man who first arrives To tell the doctor how he thrives, What people say, ?????? ?????? ??? ????????? ???????. Soph.how sure they are That none stand half the chance of— So firm a friend, so fine a writer, His wig so suited to a mitre, And many pretty things beside, Feigned just as fast as he could ride. With lordly mien and solemn air, The doctor takes his elbow chair. Then rings for Ralph, who orders John To ask the cook if Jane is gone Through garden, orchard, field, and house, In search of daughter and of spouse. When servants, daughter, spouse appear He thus begins from elbow chair. “ Let not my candid reader imagine that I intend to gratify his malevolence by exposing the defects alone of this extraordinary character. There are enough of those who wish to elevate themselves, by depressing their neighbours. It is however possible to laugh at the foibles of a man, without detracting from his worth: besides this man stands in the very middle of my canvass, and how could he be omitted. (If this be a bull, so much the better for Reviewer, but to return.) My uncle Toby is not the less amiable for his whims. They endear him to the reader, and he gains almost as much by eccentricity as by benevolence. But this is only the case where eccentricity and benevolence are united. The person of whom I am speaking, is not inferior to my uncle Toby in whims and simplicity, or to any man in information and ????. Learning and eloquence are the most remarkable parts of his character, but the least estimable. True, there is much in it offensive to the prudish, ridiculous to the cunning, abominable to the hypocritical: but amends are made by the candid and enlightened—by a consciousness, which arises from experience, that those men who have known him the longest, must reverence him the most. You perceive, perhaps, that the subject has made me dull and serious—perhaps you perceived the former before. Now supposing that he has dared to follow me so far, I have anticipated the critic—But to return a second time. I may tickle, but I would not sting the doctor. I gather my nettles for the asses which surround him, and not for himself or his friends.Our brother tells us that the weight Of fearful things in church and state, Corruptions rank, and slanders evil Ecclesiastical and civil— Press sorely on, in short, demand Some wiser head, and firmer hand; And thus, as fit for seals and see, The people look to Fox and me.

As Somnus sent by mighty Jove Forsook the radiant realms of love, In darkness veil'd his silent wing, Then sought the tent, where slept the king.

I too, in the beginning of mine, have cautiously avoided any unpoetical resemblance. Thus sent by none, divine or mortal, This brother seeks the doctor's portal. You must have seen, or heard, or read, Feathers in swiftness yield to lead; He mounts, he flies, he cuts the air, For want of wings upon a mare, And fills with vain and empty words The doctor's scull like—House of Lords. No matter whether Somnus knew That what he whispered was not true; Who hears the modern Somnus vows, he Is twice as marvellous and drowsy. The doctor, like Atrides, goes Up stairs to dress in Sunday clothes: Erect he sits beside the bed As barber shaves his learned head— Behold that head, like cloud-capt tower, Adorned with monstrous cauliflower! Still sounds the news, the ear still itches, While shirt is air'd, and changed are breeches: Next waistcoat smooth as e'er was worn, The stuff is silk, the buttons horn: With long loose skirts a well-brushed coat, A stock stiff starched about his throat, And polished shoes to grace his feet,— I have spoken with great admiration of the Doctor's dress, but others have declared that formerly he could raise mustard and cress upon his hat crown. So all is comely, all is neat. Nay more, believe me, did he then Than Agamemnon king of men; Who dressed and hurried from the place, Nor washed his hands, nor washed his face. Now, gentle reader! now behold How true is what the doctor told “From East to West, from North to South, With anxious eyes, and gaping mouth, Congratulation sallies forth, The roads are covered with the cloth, And fortune brings them to his door Had these same prophetic tidings been true, and I wish indeed that they had, there is one great episcopal duty in which the Doctor would have yielded to none of his brethren. He has been qualifying himself most assiduously in the exercise of hospitality for a great many years; and if, as I have hinted in another place, his own morning calls are occasionally a little later than custom prescribes, it is accordant with that universal and unerring rule which instructs us to do as we would that others should do unto us. Just as he said, while clock strikes four!” BOOK III. ARGUMENT. INVOCATION according to custom.—Description of a future Doctor, who had been described before under the character of Somnus.—Second character.—The shadow of a shade.—The Author's caution to his reader respeeting some metaphorical language on this pair.—Extraordinary instances of laudable ambition —Pathetical address to them—A third character—The great man—surprising instance of his early attainments—His prudence—Good advice from the author—Description of jealousy.

We, wretched mortals! lost in doubts below But guess by humour, and but say we know. Pope. I wretched mortal! lost in doubts But hear of dinners, guess at routs: For all I learn is learnt from you, Pope says that “it is hard to conceive any address more solemn, any opening to a poem more noble and magnificent than Homer's invocation before his catalogue.” I am sorry that Pope has not lived to read mine. If I only equal Homer in solemnity and magnificence, I far surpass him in elegance and propriety. What do the muses know of ships and soldiers? Why should Homer suppose that they had more brass about them, or, individually, more tongues in their heads, than himself?—Now my pretty maidens, as they are described in the second book, can easily be imagined to relate what went on at a feast, and to tell who were the guests. If I had been sure of as many commentators as Homer was blessed with, I should have left these discoveries to them and my readers: but the former are alas! no more: and the latter may be, nay ten to one are, most lamentable blockheads. Tell, pretty maidens! tell me who? What shall I call, what title give That ???? less, neutral, negative, That shapeless substance, pursy ghost, Ambitious sluggard, walking post, That sediment of silly things, That Somnus but for lack of wings? How shall I name, or how be mute on, That rival of Sir Isaac Newton, That planeless flat, that pointless angle, That disputant too dull to wrangle, That philosophic butt for laughter, That doctor “that shall be hereafter.” Macbeth. He studious mortal, he can tell Diverging lines from parallel, Make ladies wonder while he passes Triumphant o'er the bridge of asses; And clowns admire his fruitful brain With “well done Doctor try again!” I have not done with this character yet: but it will save both time and trouble, to couple him with the next. They may run on together, like two of his own hounds. If they do not exactly agree, they cannot part: one pulls a little this way, and the other that, but still they go together. He brought the news—to him belong The earliest tributes of my song. —first arrived, and lo! we find The shadow of a shade behind!

Farewell! if aught my muse can do In stuffing owls, or painting you— Farewell if aught that muse avail Now which of these truly learned and sagacious admirers it was that wrote the Doctor's life, I pretend not to determine. But his life is written among the public characters, and evidently by an admirer. As a composition, it is rather too good for the first on my list, and, I should hope, rather too bad for any of the rest. The Doctor's style is vilely caricatured in all its defects, an infallible consequence of stupid imitation. His great stumbling-block is a climax, and now behold a climax which in any other work would have broken the writer's neck. “The riots in Birmingham, which happened in 1791, will be remembered by the latest posterity, not more for the numerous and diffusive mischiefs which they occasioned, than for the meanness of spirit”— very good—“blindness of rage”—very good again, hold up! “and intemperance of zeal”—O! lack a day!!!—“with which the mob attacked the peaceful abode of Dr. Priestley,” &amp;c. The shadow may have volunteered this life now, having been appointed or retained to write another hereafter. Let us hope, however, that the Doctor will live long enough “to do for him as much.” This will be a new and desirable method to the world, of repaying his kind intentions. It will reward an humble and patient successor to Boswell, and ruin an ancient axiom for ever. The book of which I have spoken, the public characters, is a very useful national work. Like some of the Reviews and other periodical publications, it employs those who either could or would do nothing else. Numbers gain their bread honestly, no doubt, now, that might otherwise be very burdensome to their parishes, or dangerous in a moral and well-regulated bridewell. The reviews, and the work under our consideration, are conducted upon very different plans, and thus they become suitable to very different capacities. Some men are better qualified for flattery than abuse, some can write and spell a little, who do not like the trouble of reading at all, and who foolishly fancy that reading is necessary; and lastly some, whose excessive stupidity would disqualify them for critics of any sort, possess abundant wisdom for biographers like these. This book excites our compassion, and it will be patronised by the humane. They will say to each of those who conduct it, like the good natured Lord Lafeu to Parolles, “Though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat.” But the book has other advantages besides these. It contains the lives of many, who, till now, were never known to have existed. It is of infinite service to such as are admired by none but themselves, and this is the case with ninety and nine men out of a hundred. We shall have the lives, most likely, of all those whom I am now celebrating, since they too, were it not for me, would be in a similar predicament. It is my business, however, if their ambition be not very immoderate, to save them the trouble of writing their own characters. The work is also exceedingly useful to those authors who fancy that others are not half so well qualified for this employment as themselves. See Mr. Pratt's Life, and two thirds of every Vol. Some, who were rather dissatisfied with the praises of their friends in a first life, have very obligingly consented to praise themselves in a second. See the second life of Miss Seward, 6th Vol. But allowances should be made for the vanities of a second life, when we reflect upon the weaknesses of a second childhood. And weakness would have served for an a pology thirty years ago. In fixing lanthorns to a tail! But, mercy on us! who comes next Half grinning, frowning, pleased, and vext; With studied air, contracted brow, As if he cried “now! mind me now!?” Did ever awe-struck mortals eyes View one so great, or one so wise? So sharp in wit, in sense so sound, So quick, so bright, yet so profound? Did ever laughing mortal see One half so pleased with self as he? 'Tis said that scarce a fortnight old, I only tell what I was told— With mimic gestures, varying faces, He studied attitudes and graces, And even then, that he would teach His nurse to rhyme, his doll to preach! Since nature, practice, age, combine, Frown on, frown on a great divine! While prudence shelters—and you, A very little Greek will do: Let Greek alone! and e'er you chatter On any other learned matter, Never forget this cautious plan, If not your subject, know your man. To brother parsons talk of war, Of fiddlesticks to Doctor— To beauties trace the roots of words, Prove Christianity to Lords, To clowns deal politics, and preach On all, but what he knows, to each! With smiles you strive, yet strive in vain To heal the wound, or hide the pain; In every twitch and jerk we see That green-eyed monster jealousy: Congratulation hails the host, And lo! like murder'd Banquo's Ghost, In scorn, a little loathsome beast Usurps the stool, and mocks the feast! For envy plays us slippery tricks In smaller things than bishoprics: “Be great,” exclaims the restless fagot, “A frog an ox—a mite a maggot;” And thus she fires thy sapient pate To rival, not to imitate. But never mind! the truly wise Can talk at least and moralize. If reason guide us, if we look, What means a crosier but a crook? And what is mitre, what is Lord, But name profane, but thing abhor'd? So wisdom taught me—reader so These great moralists instruct us to conquer envy by lessening the object envied, or the enjoyment of those whom we envy. If you see a rich man, say they, recollect his cares, and anticipate his losses. But this is encouraging as bad a passion as the one that it is intended to remove. It teaches us to rejoice in the calamities of another, and to consider ourselves as really unfortunate while our neighbour is happier. We must reduce his felicity before we can rest!

There is a gap between every two words. Instead of an aid it is an impediment. Poor Tom Warton's “Clock swinging slow with sweepy sway,” is ten times worse. This exquisite specimen is sufficient to place the author above all his brethren. There is something like fortune in the effusions of genius. To produce this they were united. Critics may cavil, but that which excites their malevolence, ensures my immortality. And every wrong, and every ill That vex'd them once, or vexes still. Since grief will rage, our thrifty sires Preserved their chins for floods and fires. Thus armed against the worst of woes, They tore their beards to save their clothes! But now, forsooth, as if despair Scorned such a brittle hold as hair— Or else as if the barber's lather Could take them both away togather I spell this word as it should be spelt, because it mends the rhyme.— The fearless, senseless, beardless fops, Wear costly clothes, and close-clipt tops, And for the sake of smoother joles Damn both their own and neighbour's souls! No beard had he, his clothes were new, But sorrow taught him what to do— Like Hassan, thrice, the afflicted man Sighed, smote his breast, and thus began! “Ah me forlorn! shall crowds behold In cassoc, band, and frame of gold, The Doctor smiling from a wall, Whilst I must never hang at all, Or sus. per Coll.! and shall he grace The exhibition with his face, Mine quite unknown! though formed with care Year after year, to figure there?” He spake, and ended with a sigh— Go wretched man! ah! go and die! Grief filled the house, his wife related Not why, but how, he mourned to The poet flies with friendship's wings, And softly says, or sweetly sings, “Tell me restless, tell me why Sullen sorrow dims your eye, Care contracts your clouded brow Tell me sometime! tell me now, What misfortune thus can move, Broken friendship, faithless love?

But swan or not, away he flew, And told the painter what to do. Yea on those very wings which bore That mighty burden there before; The wings of friendship—not of verse, On those he travels like a herse, With vast solemnity and state When lifeless figures load his pate; But empty, both the herse and he Move on with more celerity.

In dread sublimity of snout He fairly cut the Doctor out, And all the other sons of men From Fe Fo Fum to Saracen! BOOK V. ARGUMENT. A very pretty invocation. A short and an uncommon character—A shorter, and a still more uncommon one—Ambitious Jack—his imitations and originality—Good advice from the author—The Della Cruscan Poet's absence accounted for— Another Episode began, and the fifth book concluded. “Now good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both!” Macbeth. Come! for ye know me, I am he That scorns the tea-pot and the tea! That wisely wishes, when he sings, To tune his pipe with better things, And that extol'd, in strains divine, The wonderous powers of beer and wine! Come! be ye maids or not, for why Should poets talk of chastity? Come! be ye fair, or black ye be, For what the plague is that to me? Like Venus come, or Mother Bunch, Daughters of beer, and wine, and punch! Let statesmen growl, and heroes bristle, And let the wise man wet his whistle! Church clock had struck, and, hot as fire, The next that came was faithful — None hail'd in joy with greater glee, None felt in sorrow more than he: The feast he shared, and he would share A fast, if grief had kept one there. And, next to him, with rosy gills, Approached facetious, polished — A witty man, a wise one too, Who, knowing much, hid half he knew. Terrestrial Jack—thou man of earth! Though last, not least in weight and girth, From distant climes, the land of eating, Whipping, spurring, puffing, sweating; On foaming horse, with frantic haste Hail! king of suet! prince of paste! Zeal eats thee up, and he will eat A strange variety of meat! Men feed on flesh, and beasts on grass, But zeal must have a taste for brass! Ambitious Jack! if thou can'st speak Ten words, or more, of useless Greek; If thou can'st jabber right or wrong, In place or out, words ten feet long, If thou can'st lisp and sputter faster Than any man besides thy master: Then run the race which he has ran, And scorn to live like mortal man! Then wear no waistcoat if it reaches Within a foot above thy breeches— Let breeches fall, and waistcoat rise! Were braces made to bind the wise? How many travellers have shown That Zephyrs cool the torrid zone— So follow nature—where's the hurt In two or three square feet of shirt? The Doctor stands before thy sight, And what he does or thinks is right. But ways there are in which we own Cool easy Jack proceeds alone: Why lisp thy scorn when ladies talk? Why pick thy teeth with neighbour's fork? Why clap thine elbow in his plate? Why scrape thy nails, and scratch thy pate? But still whate'er thy sense or breeding, Thy width of shirt, or depth of reading, Thy lisping Latin, loosened braces, Untoward tricks, and strange grimaces, Thou wilt do well, in one thing more, To follow him who walks before— For men, like sheep, must go astray, Arist. Met.—Plut.—Arist de Anim. Who follow any other way. Mock thou his heart, since all declare Nothing is very faulty there. So Jack came last, and no one waited The rap of Della Cruscan — — For, like Achilles, swoln with ire, He shun'd, as hell, the Doctor's fire, Nor deigned to choak or drown his wrath With beef and mutton, soup and broth! Thus, gentle reader, thus began The rage which burst this mighty man. Not quite so sad the tale which I do Tell, as Æneas told to Dido; Nor half as long a time I bore ye, Conticuere comnes intentique ora tenebant. Virgil. My readers may depend upon the authenticity of this story in all its parts.So stretch your jaws to catch my story. For idle chat or learned bother One Doctor went to see another.(2nd Doctor) “Pray stay and dine.”(1st Doctor)“I dine at home.”(2nd Doctor) “The dishes cool! poo! nonsense! come.”(1st Doctor) “Lead on then! march!”—And so the sinner Said grace, sat down, and eat his dinner: As chance had snapt the horse's crupper, He staid to tea, he staid to supper, While drunken saddler fail'd to come How could the Doctor journey home? The brawn was fine, well boil'd the tripe, Tobacco fresh, and clean the pipe, So many causes all combined To check his haste, and change his mind. But they who are right hospitable Give not alone a place at table, The host and hostess therefore said “Doctor you better take a bed:” He thanks them both, and dare aver That none can answer no to her. He stays—the bed is soon prepared The night-cap warmed—the sheets are air'd, And you may tell, as if you'd seen, How soon the Doctor slipt between. BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. AFTER a display of no common learning, the narrative continued. The Doctor's extraordinary escape—Reflections and soliloquy—He moralises in vain—a proof of it.—The effects of his example on Somnus—The soliloquy related to the Della Cruscan Poet—and thus the Della Cruscan Poet's absence accounted for—A very old simile but a very good one—quite original in its application.—The author shews some astronomical knowledge— The Della Cruscan Poet's accomplishments—The surprising perverseness of many people during the representation of his tragedy, accounted for. “Double, double, toil and trouble, Fire burn; and cauldron bubble! Cool it with a Baboon's blood, Then the charm is firm and good!” Macbetm. Most gentle reader! prithee pardon The wanderings of thy humble bard on So very high a theme as this is— Who hears not, knows not what he misses. We go a journey, and the roads Are cross'd, not stopp'd, by Episodes. If grave Quintilian somewhere teaches How books resemble people's breeches, In this that breeches were designed To shew the shape, as books the mind— And thence infers, when hanging loose, The more the stuff, the less the use. Would he in buck-skin case confine us? Tollius Long.—Faber et Dacierus—Manutius—Boileau. Or if he would grave Longinus? Who rides on Pegasus, may ride With him and Homer by his side Both fast and slow, both far and wide. A man's a noodle if he aims To square his work by rules from Kaims, A man's a blockhead that would throttle His muse for sake of Aristotle. If not more gentle than discerning Reader, by this, you see my learning— That fairly known and duly rated, I turn again to—and— Now whether too much tripe or brawn, Or frightful dreams of fleeting lawn— Whatever caused, the Doctor fled The Doctor had better fortune on this occasion than he is said to have had on others. But just in time to save his bed. Perchance of what might hap aware, Before he bent his knees in prayer, He sought and found a seat-less chair. So well contrived, one less discerning, Less used than he to midnight learning; I say an uninstructed mind Might never know for what designed. Now was his time to bless the care Of those whose caution placed it there; He sits not thanklessly—lo! he Is heard in this soliloquy! “But just in time—scarce that I fear— 'Twas well I knew the corner where— Man, wretched man! by dangers warned, May learn to prize what late he scorned! How short his views! how often fated To wish for what he scorned or hated! Though critics spurn, and children mock it— O! were the Regent in my pocket! What would one page be worth to me Of Della Cruscan poetry! And was, forsooth, their only use To light a candle, singe a goose, Or curl the long lank hair of Molly? Wise men may live to curse their folly! I never dreamt, till doomed to lose them, This was the properest way to use them! Thou chattering, pompous, empty-pated, Half-reasoning, rhyming, prosing — — I'll bait thee as thou should'st be baited!” He searched his pockets o'er again, But moralized and searched in vain! In vain alas! for this is certain That Doctor used the other's curtain. 'Tis said—and I believe the tale, That Somnus, stuffed with tripe and ale, Cried “ho! my boots! the grey must gallop— A sixpence for an ounce of jalap!” How strong in man is lust of fame, He goes to bed, and does the same! But to return—enough is stated To shew why Della Cruscan — — Who heard of all the Doctor said Who related it also to me: and her authority is as good as a Muse's: not to say better. From vexed and listening chamber-maid. The ranting Regent's wrongs resented, “Et concione se” absented. Most people know that planets run For light and heat around the sun: (Alas! how plain it is to see As many know my simile! I must go on since I began it) And little worlds attend a planet: Far off indeed, tho' nearest, far, His beams came straight from Doctor — Now some astronomers have found The nearest planet turns not round, While one side roasts, they boldly tax his Unequal light for want of axis: But to apply what they remark, There may be moons though in the dark; And pictured Gorgon's pretty son Is just exactly such an one! This Mercury can write and speak Italian, German, French, and(Reader) “Greek!”(Author) Greek! who said Greek? did I put that in? No, Sir, he scorns both Greek and Latin! But to make up, there is none better Abrah. Roger. of Rel. Bram.—Cabbal. Diss. 8 Rittang. At senses, organs, and at meta- Physics in every different branch From Aristotle to Malbranche! He dwells on Hume and Hobbs and Clarke, Till clear grows dim, and light grows dark. In spite of Reid, or any other, He can convince by dint of bother Whatever silly men suppose Though pinch'd and pull'd that no one knows Whether he have or not a nose. But not confined to reason, he Indulged his vein for poetry. Shakspeare his model, and as like As sign-post painter to Vandyke. Though blushing Siddons kindly strain'd To save the play, and serve her friend— It happened most surprisingly That folk would laugh, when folk should cry! But wonder ceases when I tell ye His Regent has got Falstaff's belly. Sometimes in verse, sometimes in prose, —“professus grandia turget.” Hor. de Art. Poet. He stamps, he raves, he sweats, he blows, And nothing surely can be worse Than verse half prose, but prose half verse! And now I lay the bellows by Mysterious vase of mighty Guy! “Verum ita risores, ita commendare dicaces Conveniet Satyros—ita vertere seria ludo.” Hor. de Art. Poet. But soon their panting lungs shall strain To make thee smoke and boil again! And now, gentle Reader, I take my leave of you for the present. When we meet again, I will relate the remainder of my story. It is full of the most surprising matter; but I was impatient to make you acquainted with so many illustrious characters first. Having effected that, I shall communicate the rest— not only all they did, but all they said. In the mean time let me invite you to study diligently that which is in your hands. You are as yet only in the porch of this magnificent edifice which I am erecting to learning: but every other part, yea even to the closets and chambers, shall be thrown open. With all due humility, I earnestly and modestly believe that there is no one better calculated for your guide than myself. Is there any man who possesses either more fancy or more learning? I can let you into the secrets of literature better than most other persons, because I am far more candid, and thoroughly acquainted with them. I can tell you things of wise and learned men, and of men who are neither wise nor learned, which will harrow up your very soul, and make their bristles “like quills upon the fretful porcupine.” For the present, most gentle Reader, FAREWELL.</field>
