      <field name="fulltext">GRONGAR HILL. Silent Nymph, with curious eye, Who the purple ev'ning lie On the mountain's lonely van, Beyond the noise of busy man, Painting fair the form of things, While the yellow linnet sings; Or the tuneful nightingale Charms the forest with her tale; Come, with all thy various hues, Come, and aid thy sister Muse; Now, while PhÅbus, riding high, Gives lustre to the land and sky, Grongar Hill invites my song, Draw the landskip bright and strong; Grongar, in whose mossy cells, Sweetly musing, Quiet dwells; Grongar, in whose silent shade, For the modest Muses made, So oft I have, the ev'ning still, At the fountain of a rill Sate upon a flow'ry bed, With my hand beneath my head; While stray'd my eyes o'er Towy's flood, Over mead, and over wood, From house to house, from hill to hill, 'Till Contemplation had her fill. About his chequer'd sides I wind, And leave his brooks and meads behind, And groves, and grottos where I lay, And vistas shooting beams of day: Wide and wider spreads the vale, As circles on a smooth canal: The mountains round, unhappy fate! Sooner or later, of all height, Withdraw their summits from the skies, And lessen as the others rise: Still the prospect wider spreads, Adds a thousand woods and meads, Still it widens, widens still, And sinks the newly-risen hill. Now, I gain the mountain's brow, What a landskip lies below! No clouds, no vapours intervene, But the gay, the open scene Does the face of nature show, In all the hues of heaven's bow! And, swelling to embrace the light, Spreads around beneath the sight. Old castles on the cliffs arise, Proudly towering in the skies! Rushing from the woods, the spires Seem from hence ascending fires! Half his beams Apollo sheds On the yellow mountain-heads! Gilds the fleeces of the flocks, And glitters on the broken rocks! Below me trees unnumber'd rise, Beautiful in various dyes: The gloomy pine, the poplar blue, The yellow beech, the sable yew, The slender fir, that taper grows, The sturdy oak, with broad-spread boughs; And, beyond, the purple grove, Haunt of Phyllis, queen of love! Gaudy as the op'ning dawn, Lies a long and level lawn, On which a dark hill, steep and high, Holds and charms the wandering eye! Deep are his feet in Towy's flood, His sides are cloth'd with waving wood, And ancient towers crown his brow, That cast an aweful look below; Whose ragged walls the ivy creeps, And with her arms from falling keeps; So both a safety from the wind In mutual dependence find. 'Tis now the raven's bleak abode; 'Tis now the apartment of the toad; And there the fox securely feeds; And there the pois'nous adder breeds, Conceal'd in ruins, moss, and weeds; While, ever and anon, there falls Huge heap of hoary moulder'd walls. Yet time has seen, that lifts the low, And level lays the lofty brow, Has seen this broken pile complete, Big with the vanity of state; But transient is the smile of Fate! A little rule, a little sway, A sunbeam in a winter's day, Is all the proud and mighty have Between the cradle and the grave. And see the rivers how they run Thro' woods and meads, in shade and sun! Sometimes swift, sometimes slow, Wave succeeding wave, they go A various journey to the deep, Like human life to endless sleep! Thus is nature's vesture wrought, To instruct our wand'ring thought; Thus she dresses green and gay, To disperse our cares away. Ever charming, ever new, When will the landskip tire the view! The fountain's fall, the river's flow, The woody valleys, warm and low: The windy summit, wild and high, Roughly rushing on the sky! The pleasant seat, the ruin'd tow'r, The naked rock, the shady bow'r; The town and village, dome and farm, Each give each a double charm, As pearls upon an Ethiop's arm. See on the mountain's southern side, Where the prospect opens wide, Where the evening gilds the tide; How close and small the hedges lie! What streaks of meadows cross the eye! A step, methinks, may pass the stream, So little distant dangers seem: So we mistake the Future's face, Ey'd thro' Hope's deluding glass: As yon summits soft and fair, Clad in colours of the air, Which to those who journey near, Barren, brown, and rough appear; Still we tread the same coarse way; The present's still a cloudy day. O may I with myself agree, And never covet what I see: Content me with an humble shade, My passions tam'd, my wishes laid; For while our wishes wildly roll, We banish quiet from the soul: 'Tis thus the busy beat the air; And misers gather wealth and care. Now, ev'n now, my joys run high, As on the mountain-turf I lie: While the wanton Zephyr sings, And in the vale perfumes his wings; While the waters murmur deep; While the shepherd charms his sheep; While the birds unbounded fly, And with music fill the sky, Now, ev'n now, my joys run high. Be full, ye courts; be great who will; Search for Peace with all your skill: Open wide the lofty door, Seek her on the marble floor: In vain ye search, she is not there: In vain ye search the domes of Care! Grass and flowers Quiet treads, On the meads, and mountain-heads, Along with Pleasure, close ally'd, Ever by each other's side: And often, by the murm'ring rill, Hears the thrush, while all is still, Within the groves of Grongar Hill. THE COUNTRY WALK. The morning's fair; the lusty Sun With ruddy cheek begins to run; And early birds, that wing the skies, Sweetly sing to see him rise. I am resolved, this charming day, In the open field to stray, And have no roof above my head, But that whereon the gods do tread. Before the yellow barn I see A beautiful variety Of strutting cocks, advancing stout, And flirting empty chaff about: Hens, ducks, and geese, and all their brood, And turkeys gobbling for their food, While rustics thrash the wealthy floor, And tempt them all to crowd the door. What a fair face does Nature show! Augusta! wipe thy dusty brow; A landscape wide salutes my sight Of shady vales and mountains bright; And azure heavens I behold, And clouds of silver and of gold. And now into the fields I go, Where thousand flaming flowers glow, And every neighb'ring hedge I greet, With honeysuckle smelling sweet. Now o'er the daisy-meads I stray, And meet with, as I pace my way, Sweetly shining on the eye, A riv'let gliding smoothly by, Which shows with what an easy tide The moments of the happy glide: Here, finding pleasure after pain, Sleeping, I see a weary'd swain, While his full scrip lies open by, That does his healthy food supply. Happy swain! sure happier far Than lofty kings and princes are! Enjoy sweet sleep, which shuns the crown, With all its easy beds of down. The Sun now shows his noontide blaze, And sheds around me burning rays. A little onward, and I go Into the shade that groves bestow, And on green moss I lay me down, That o'er the root of oak has grown; Where all is silent, but some flood That sweetly murmurs in the wood; But birds that warble in the sprays, And charm ev'n Silence with their lays. Oh! pow'rful Silence! How you reign In the poet's busy brain! His num'rous thoughts obey the calls Of the tuneful waterfalls; Like moles, whene'er the coast is clear, They rise before thee without fear, And range in parties here and there. Some wildly to Parnassus wing, And view the fair Castalian spring, Where they behold a lonely well Where now no tuneful Muses dwell, But now and then a slavish hind Paddling the troubled pool they find. Some trace the pleasing paths of joy, Others the blissful scene destroy, In thorny tracks of sorrow stray, And pine for Clio far away. But stayâMethinks her lays I hear, So smooth! so sweet! so deep! so clear! No, it is not her voice I find; 'Tis but the echo stays behind. Some meditate Ambition's brow, And the black gulph that gapes below; Some peep in courts, and there they see The sneaking tribe of Flattery:â But, striking to the ear and eye, A nimble deer comes bounding by! When rushing from yon rustling spray, It made them vanish all away. I rouse me up, and on I rove; 'Tis more than time to leave the grove; The Sun declines, the evening breeze Begins to whisper through the trees; And as I leave the sylvan gloom, As to the glare of day I come, An old man's smoky nest I see Leaning on an aged tree, Whose willow walls, and furzy brow, A little garden sway below. Through spreading beds of blooming green, Matted with herbage sweet and clean, A vein of water limps along, And makes them ever green and young. Here he puffs upon his spade, And digs up cabbage in the shade; His tatter'd rags are sable brown, His beard and hair are hoary grown: The dying sap descends apace, And leaves a withered hand and face. Up Grongar Hill I labour now, And catch at last his bushy brow. Oh! how fresh, how pure the air! Let me breathe a little here. Where am I, Nature? I descry Thy magazine before me lie. Temples! and towns! and towers! and woods! And hills! and rills! and fields! and floods! Crowding before me, edg'd around With naked wilds, and barren ground. See, below, the pleasant dome, The poet's pride, the poet's home, Which the sunbeams shine upon, To the even from the dawn. See her woods, where Echo talks, Her gardens trim, her terrace walks, Her wildernesses, fragrant brakes, Her gloomy bowers, and shining lakes. Keep, ye gods! this humble seat For ever pleasant, private, neat. See yonder hill, uprising steep, Above the river slow and deep; It looks from hence a pyramid, Beneath a verdant forest hid; On whose high top there rises great, The mighty remnant of a seat, An old green tow'r, whose batter'd brow Frowns upon the vale below. Look upon that flowery plain, How the sheep surround their swain, How they crowd to hear his strain! All careless with his legs across, Leaning on a bank of moss, He spends his empty hours at play, Which fly as light as down away. And there behold a bloomy mead, A silver stream, a willow shade, Beneath the shade a fisher stand, Who, with the angle in his hand, Swings the nibbling fry to land. In blushes the descending sun Kisses the streams, while slow they run; And yonder hill remoter grows, Or dusky clouds do interpose. The fields are left, the lab'ring hind His weary oxen does unbind; And vocal mountains, as they low, Re-echo to the vales below. The jocund shepherds piping come, And drive the herd before them home; And now begin to light their fires, Which send up smoke in curling spires; While with light hearts all homeward tend, To Aberglasney I descend. But oh! how bless'd would be the day, Did I with Clio pace my way, And not alone and solitary stray! TO AURELIA. See, the flowery Spring is blown, Let us leave the smoky Town: From the Mall, and from the Ring, Every one has taken wing; Cloe, Strephon, Corydon, To the meadows all are gone What is left you worth your stay? Come, Aurelia, come away. Come, Aurelia, come and see What a lodge I've dress'd for thee; But the seat you cannot see, 'Tis so hid with jessamy, With the vine that o'er the walls, And in every window, crawls; Let us there be blithe and gay! Come, Aurelia, come away. Come with all thy sweetest wiles, With thy graces and thy smiles; Come, and we will merry be, Who shall be so blest as we? We will frolic all the day, Haste, Aurelia, while we may: Ay! and should not life be gay? Yes, AureliaâCome away. AN EPISTLE TO A FAMOUS PAINTER. Delightful partner of my heart, Master of the loveliest art! How sweet our senses you deceive, When we, a gazing throng, believe! Here flows the Po, the Minis there, Winding about with sedgy hair; And there the Tiber's yellow flood, Beneath a thick and gloomy wood; And there Darius' broken ranks Upon the Granic's bloody banks, Who bravely die, or basely run From Philip's all-subduing son; And there the wounded Porus, brought (The bravest man that ever fought!) To Alexander's tent, who eyes His dauntless visage, as he lies In death's most painful agonies. To me reveal thy heav'nly art, To me thy mysteries impart. As yet I but in verse can paint, And to th' idea colour faint, What to th' open eye you show, Seeming Nature's living glow; The beauteous shapes of objects near, Or distant ones confus'd in air; The golden eve, the blinking dawn, Smiling on the lovely lawn! And pleasing views of checker'd glades! And rivers winding thro' the shades! And sunny hills, and pleasant plains! And groups of merry nymphs and swains! Or some old building, hid with grass, Rearing sad its ruin'd face, Whose columns, friezes, statues lie, The grief and wonder of the eye! Or swift adown a mountain tall A foaming cat'ract's sounding fall, Whose loud roaring stuns the ear Of the wondering traveller; Or a calm and quiet bay, And a level, shining sea; Or surges rough, that froth and roar, And, angry, dash the sounding shore; And vessels toss'd, and billows high, And light'ning flashing from the sky; Or that which gives the most delight, The fair idea (seeming sight!) Of warrior fierce, with shining blade, Or orator, with arms display'd: Tully's engaging air and mien, Declaiming against Catiline; Or fierce Achilles towering high Above his foes, who round him die. Or Hercules, with lion's hide, And knotty cudgel thrown aside, Lifting AntÃ¦us high in air, Who in his gripe expires there. Or Sisyphus, with toil and sweat, And muscles strain'd, striving to get Up a steep hill a ponderous stone, Which near the top recoils, and rolls impetuous down; Or beauteous Helen's easy air, With head reclin'd, and flowing hair; Or comely Paris, gay and young, Moving with gallant grace along!â These you can doâI but advance In a florid ignorance, And say to you, who better know, You should design them so and so. THE INQUIRY. Ye poor little sheep! Ah! well may ye stray, While sad is your shepherd, and Clio away! Tell where have you been; have you met with my love, On the mountain, or valley, or meadow, or grove? Alas-a-day! Noâye are starv'd and half dead; Ye saw not my love, or ye all had been fed. Oh, Sun! did you see her? Ah, surely you did: 'Mong whatâwillows, or woodbines, or reeds, is she hid? Ye tall whistling pines! that on yonder hill grow, And o'erlook the beautiful valley below, Did you see her a-roving in wood, or in brake, Or bathing her fair limbs in some silent lake? Ye mountains! that look on the vigorous east, And the north, and the south, and the wearisome west, Pray tell where she hides her; you surely do know; And let not her lover pine after her so. Oh! had I the wings of an eagle, I'd fly Along with bright PhÅbus all over the sky; Like an eagle look down, with my wings wide display'd, And dart in my eye at each whispering shade: I'd search ev'ry tuft in my diligent tour, I'd unravel the woodbine, and look in each bow'r, Till I found out my Clio, and ended my pain, And made myself quiet and happy again. TO CLIO. FROM ROME. Alas, dear Clio, every day, Some sweet idea dies away: Echoes of songs, and dreams of joys, Inhuman absence all destroys. Inhuman absenceâand his train, Avarice, and toil, and care, and pain, And strife and trouble.âOh! for love, Angelic Clio, these remove! Nothing, alas, where'er I walk, Nothing but fear and sorrow talk; Where'er I walk, from bound to bound, Nothing but ruin spreads around, Or busts that seem from graves to rise, Or statues stern, with sightless eyes, Cold Death's pale people:âOh! for love, Angelic Clio, these remove! The tuneful song, O speed away, Say every sweet thing love can say, Speed the bright beams of wit and sense, Speed thy white doves, and draw me hence. So may the carved, fair, speaking stone, Persuasive half, and half moss-grown, So may the column's graceful height, O'er woods and temples gleaming bright, And the wreathed urn, among the vines, Whose form my pencil now designs, Be, with their ashes, lost in air, No more the trifles of my care. WRITTEN AT ST. PETER'S. O gracious Lord, forgive us; we are all, All of us, sinners vile; But these, who build Greatness upon their brethren's miseries; Who scorn to make Thy meek and patient life The pattern of their doings; yet put on A day-dress of religion; hypocrites! Who faiths absurd exact with fiery zeal; And strive to thrall the tongue to their decrees, Not win the spirit to the bond of love:â God of our fathers, keep us from the ways Of these foul hirelings. Less Thy glory pure Seek they to magnify, than that of men: For basest ends the simple they perplex, And with the guise of learning, check the hope That rises in their hearts from virtuous deeds. FRAGMENT. [While to the unstudied lay I leaned my ear] While to the unstudied lay I leaned my ear Fearful of noise, and covetous to hear, A white-robed friar rolled majestic in, Behind his belly, and his treble chin. He trod a noisy step, ungain, uneven, And showed a visage very fleshly given. Alas! who can the ills of life foresee? This holy limber lodged and stuck by me. Next a gray friar came with studied grace, A formal sadness hung upon his face, Poor man, mistaken zeal enticed him on, And shrunk my creature to a skeleton: Oft on his eyeballs, as his fancy strayed, The wild delirium of devotion played. While Dominic on one side pressed with pride, This pierced with carcass sharp my other side. FRAGMENT. IN HIS ITALIAN SKETCH BOOK. God of my favoured being! Thou hast made All things in wisdom. All things sing thy praise, God of the great Creation! when I raise, Before the sun and moon, my upturned eyes, Thee I confess: and, when I drop my sight Upon the holly's leaf, or bladed grass, And know that myriads feed along their folds, In perfect laws according to their kinds, Their wants, their wishes suited to the scene, Thee I acknowledge. WRITTEN AT OCRICULUM, IN ITALY, 1725. ALTERED 1730. Deep in a lonely wild, with brakes perplexed, And trunks of aged pines, and caves, and brooks; Among recumbent, ivy-grown remains Of once a city populous and proud, Long I reclined; and, with laborious hand, Figured, in picture, of the solemn scene The gloomy image: studious to excel, Of praise and fame ambitious: till her shade, Wide o'er the nodding towers, and Tiber's stream (Rolling beneath his willows, deep and dark) Evening extended; and, at length, fatigue Weighed down the droused sense, when, lo! appeared (Or awful rose before the mental eye, In vision promptive oft of sacred truths) The semblance of a seer. His open brow Calm wisdom smoothed. A veil of candid hue Hung on his silver hairs; his form erect A Tyrian robe o'erflowed, in comely folds Amply declining. To me full he turned, With outraised arm, his aspectâEloquence Spoke in the graceful act, and uttered these In numbers solemn:ââLate thy toils, obscure, Painful and perilous: thy date on earth How frail! how fleeting! has thy reason weighed? Shall the next rising sun mature the work Which now afflicts thee patient? Shalt thou raise (Fond hope!) in this fugacious scene, renown Sacred, immortal, as the poets feign, Erring? Alas, the various breath shall cease, That, yet a little while, perchance, may float, With idle sounds, about the listless grave. Poor retribution! Vain, mistaken man, Ev'n now the step of Time is at thy heels, And thee, and these thy paintings, and thy lyre, Briefly will sweep away. Around, behold, To age corrosive, all submit their forms: The Parian statue, and the brazen bust, The dome superb, the column of huge size, Prone on the ground, beneath the wandering weed; And shall the tender light and shade survive Of the soft flowing pencil? Lo, that heap! Can its dust tell thee once it rose a bath? Where are her silver urns? Where murmur now Her cool refreshing waters? Of yon tomb, Deep sunk in earth, with mouldering sculpture graced, Observe the proud inscription, how it bears But half a tale:âor turn thy curious eye To yonder obelisk, in ancient days By earthquake fall'n, a cedar's stately length, Thebaic stone, from waste ev'n yet secure, With hieroglyphic deep inwroughtâbut all With vain intent, where nations pass away, Where language dies. And now the veil of night Sables the vault of Heaven; the busy now Retire to rest, with these the bitter fruits Of their mistaken labours, care, and pain, And weariness, and sickness, and decay; Such as to-morrow shall their portion be, To-morrow and to-morrow; wretched man! Were it not better in the arms of ease To lie supine? or give the soul a loose, And frolic join, in song and riant dance, The sons of luxury? Pernicious voice! Which soon with soothing sound may sweetly lure Thy weary nature, yielding. O beware! Fly the false note, as did, in fable old, Laertes' son, on Scylla's baleful coast, The Syren's incantations: there remains Another path: not all to folly tend: Hear, and be wise; another path obscure, Narrow, despised, frequented by the few, Where sober Truth conducts the peaceful step, And, ever tuneful in the brightening scene,â Hear, and be wise,âthe silent audience charms. There shall the song reveal whate'er is meet Of thine own essence, of that conscious part (Diffused within thy frame), by which thou dost Or good, or evil; great, immortal gift! All marvellous! where matter has no share! Unutterable essence. There the song Shall tell thee, wrapt in pleasing fearful thought, In humble wonder, how thy form arose Without thy wisdom from the secret womb; How it acquires increase, suffers waste; By will not thine: by laws, to thee unknown, Incessantâtill the hour of fate performs Its dissolution, and, to life divine, Opens the speedy passage, soon revealed, Awful existence! Then declare, then say, What thought, what solemn business of the soul Shall entertain the pure eternal state! Hence, weigh thy own esteemâand yet beyondâ Marvel, within thyself to meditate That Being, whence the issues of thy life Perpetual flow; in thee He dwells, nor aught So small exists which He doth not pervade; Nor swells immensity of space beyond His boundless presence; nor to Him obscure Broods in the silent breast profoundest thought; His own works knows He not? Him who can tell! What eye discern! what earthly-musing thought The pure immediate essence may conceive! Language inadequate! Howe'er, as men, By reflex mild, behold the lamp of day Shorn of his radiance in the level flood; So, in the veil of His creation wide, So, shrouded in His boundless tabernacle, With lowliest reverence view the Infinite Majestyâo'er the blue vast above, In those bright orbs, innumerable worlds! And o'er this various globe, earth, ocean, air, Him, in his works, behold! How beauteous, all! How perfect each in its peculiar state! How therefore wise, how just, how gracious, He! As far as nature weak may imitate, So be thou just, and wise, and fill thy life With deeds of good; not with vain-glorious arts Attempered to short pomp, th' erroneous praise Of men vain-seeking, but humane and meek, Content and cheerful, with religious care, (In due regard to thy contingent state) Weighing what best may be performed, and what forbore. Thus shalt thou taste the bliss they seek on earth, Vainly they seek on earth, unspotted fame, Untroubled joy, and frequent ecstasy, Through blessed eternity, in visions, fair, Brighter than human fancy may behold. âWait thy destined task:â The day shall tell the lesson of thy life.â AS TO CLIO'S PICTURE. A FRAGMENT. O deeply learned, wisely modest, tellâ Is it a fault to like thy praise so well? Pleased to be praised by thee, my spirits glow, And could I ever, I could paint her now. I meet her beauties in a brighter ray, And in my eyebeams all her graces play. Painting, great goddess, mocks my vain desires, Her lofty art a lofty soul requires; Long studies too, and fortune at command, An eye unwearied, and a patient hand; And, if I cannot brook to be confined, What scenes of nature should instruct my mind; At home, abroad, in sunshine, and in storms, I should observe her in a thousand forms; Beneath the morning and the evening sky, Beneath the nightly lamp with patient eye; Where princes oft, and oft where slaves resort, In fleets and camps, at cities and at court; Low at the base of every pillared dome, And in the awful fields of ruined Rome. But what receives the man, but what return Before his ashes fill the silent urn? A very little of his life remains, And has he no reward for all his pains? None by the thoughtless and the gay arise, None shine with merit in the miser's eyes, A veil the envious over beauties throw, And proud ambition never looks below. Were it not better seek the arms of ease, And sullen time with mirth and music please, Hold pleasant parle with Bacchus over wine? THE CAMBRO-BRITON. A FRAGMENT. There's yet the thing on earth we virtue call, Of old so much admired. Who seeks recess, Among the fields afar, at close of eve, The creature may discern. I knew a man, Within the vales of Cambria, far withdrawn From life's flagitious stage, at humble ease: Through the green reed he sends the voice of love After his warfare. Pure and meek his life, And primitive of taste, as men were wont In ancient days to live. So little pleased His uncorrupted mind: so few his wants: Yet where he could abound I could not learn, Unless Content has some mysterious wealth, And that were his. I wished to be his friend: I wished I was: and much he taught my mind. Howe'er good will survives; he took the pipe, And all the voice of love melodious flowed Through the green reed. Alas! my countryman! Can a mean swain augment the public good? Behold the Iberian; lo, the Gaul exult Thunders THE RUINS OF ROME. Enough of Grongar, and the shady dales Of winding Towy, Merlin's fabled haunt, I sung inglorious. Now the love of arts, And what in metal or in stone remains Of proud antiquity, through various realms And various languages and ages fam'd, Bears me remote, o'er Gallia's woody bounds, O'er the cloud-piercing Alps remote, beyond The vale of Arno, purpled with the vine, Beyond the Umbrian and Etruscan hills, To Latium's wide champain, forlorn and waste, Where yellow Tiber his neglected wave Mournfully rolls. Yet once again, my Muse, Yet once again, and soar a loftier flight; Lo! the resistless theme, imperial Rome. Fall'n, fall'n, a silent heap; her heroes all Sunk in their urns; behold the pride of pomp, The throne of nations fall'n; obscur'd in dust; Ev'n yet majestical: the solemn scene Elates the soul, while now the rising sun Flames on the ruins, in the purer air Tow'ring aloft, upon the glitt'ring plain, Like broken rocks, a vast circumference; Rent palaces, crushed columns, rifled moles, Fanes roll'd on fanes, and tombs on buried tombs. Deep lies in dust the Theban obelisk Immense along the waste; minuter art, Gliconian forms, or Phidian, subtly fair, O'erwhelming; as th' immense Leviathan The finny brood, when near Ierne's shore Out-stretch'd, unwieldy, his island length appears Above the foamy flood. Globose and huge, Grey mould'ring temples swell, and wide o'ercast The solitary landscape, hills and woods, And boundless wilds; while the vine-mantled brows The pendent goats unveil, regardless they Of hourly peril, though the clefted domes Tremble to every wind. The pilgrim oft At dead of night, 'mid his oraison hears Aghast! the voice of Time, disparting tow'rs, Tumbling all precipitate down-dash'd, Rattling around, loud thundering to the moon; While murmurs soothe each awful interval Of ever-falling waters; shrouded Nile, Eridanus, and Tiber with his twins, And palmy Euphrates: they with dropping locks Hang o'er their urns, and mournfully among The plaintive-echoing ruins pour their streams. Yet here, advent'rous in the sacred search Of ancient arts, the delicate of mind, Curious and modest, from all climes resort, Grateful society! with these I raise The toilsome step up the proud Palatine, Through spiry cypress groves, and tow'ring pine, Waving aloft o'er the big ruin's brows, On num'rous arches rear'd: and frequent stopp'd, The sunk ground startles me with dreadful chasm, Breathing forth darkness from the vast profound Of aisles and halls, within the mountain's womb. Nor these the nether works: all these beneath, And all beneath the vales and hills around, Extend the cavern'd sewers, massy, firm, As the Sibylline grot beside the dead Lake of Avernus; such the sewers huge, Whither the great Tarquinian genius dooms Each wave impure; and, proud with added rains, Hark how the mighty billows lash their vaults, And thunder; how they heave their rocks in vain! Though now incessant time has roll'd around A thousand winters o'er the changeful world, And yet a thousand since, th' indignant floods Roar loud in their firm bounds, and dash and swell, In vain, convey'd to Tiber's lowest wave. Hence over airy plains, by crystal founts, That weave their glitt'ring waves with tuneful lapse Among the sleeky pebbles, agate clear, Cerulean ophite, and the flow'ry vein Of orient jasper, pleas'd I move along, And vases boss'd, and huge inscriptive stones, And intermingling vines; and figur'd nymphs, Floras and Chloes of delicious mould, Cheering the darkness; and deep empty tombs, And dells, and mould'ring shrines, with old decay Rustic and green, and wide-embow'ring shades, Shot from the crooked clefts of nodding tow'rs. A solemn wilderness! With error sweet, I wind the ling'ring step, where-e'er the path Mazy conducts me, which the vulgar foot O'er sculptures maim'd has made; Anubis, Sphinx, Idols of antique guise, and horned Pan, Terrific, monstrous shapes! prepost'rous gods Of Fear and Ign'rance, by the sculptor's hand Hewn into form, and worshipp'd; as even now Blindly they worship at their breathless mouths In varied appellations: men to these (From depth to depth in dark'ning error fall'n) At length ascrib'd th' Inapplicable Name. How doth it please and fill the memory With deeds of brave renown, while on each hand Historic urns and breathing statues rise, And speaking busts! Sweet Scipio, Marius stern, Pompey superb, the spirit-stirring form Of CÃ¦sar, raptur'd with the charm of rule And boundless fame; impatient for exploits, His eager eyes upcast, he soars in thought Above all height: and his own Brutus see, Desponding Brutus, dubious of the right, In evil days of faith, of public weal, Solicitous and sad. Thy next regard Be Tully's graceful attitude; uprais'd, His out-stretch'd arm he waves, in act to speak Before the silent masters of the world, And Eloquence arrays him. There behold, Prepar'd for combat in the front of war, The pious brothers; jealous Alba stands In fearful expectation of the strife, And youthful Rome intent: the kindred foes Fall on each other's neck in silent tears; In sorrowful benevolence embraceâ Howe'er, they soon unsheath the flashing sword, Their country calls to arms; now all in vain The mother clasps the knee, and ev'n the fair Now weeps in vain; their country calls to arms. Such virtue Clelia, Cocles, Manlius, rous'd; Such were the Fabii, Decii; so inspir'd The Scipios battled, and the Gracchi spoke: So rose the Roman state. Me now, of these Deep-musing, high ambitious thoughts inflame Greatly to serve my country, distant land, And build me virtuous fame; nor shall the dust Of these fall'n piles with show of sad decay Avert the good resolve, mean argument, The fate alone of matter.âNow the brow We gain enraptur'd; beauteously distinct The num'rous porticos and domes upswell, With obelisks and columns interpos'd, And pine, and fir, and oak: so fair a scene Sees not the dervise from the spiral tomb Of ancient Chammos, while his eye beholds Proud Memphis' relics o'er the Ãgyptian plain: Nor hoary hermit from Hymettus' brow, Though graceful Athens, in the vale beneath, Along the windings of the Muse's stream, Lucid Ilyssus, weeps her silent schools And groves, unvisited by bard or sage. Amid the tow'ry ruins, huge, supreme, Th' enormous amphitheatre behold, Mountainous pile! o'er whose capacious womb Pours the broad firmament its varied light; While from the central floor the seats ascend Round above round, slow-wid'ning to the verge, A circuit vast and high: nor less had held Imperial Rome, and her attendant realms, When drunk with rule she will'd the fierce delight, And op'd the gloomy caverns, whence out-rush'd, Before th' innumerable shouting crowd, The fiery, madded, tyrants of the wilds, Lions and tigers, wolves and elephants, And desp'rate men, more fell. Abhorr'd intent! By frequent converse with familiar death, To kindle brutal daring apt for war; To lock the breast, and steel th' obdurate heart, Amid the piercing cries of sore distress Impenetrable.âBut away thine eye! Behold yon steepy cliff; the modern pile Perchance may now delight, while that, rever'd In ancient days, the page alone declares, Or narrow coin through dim cÃ¦rulean rust. The fane was Jove's, its spacious golden roof, O'er thick-surrounding temples beaming wide, Appear'd, as when above the morning hills Half the round sun ascends; and tow'rd aloft, Sustain'd by columns huge, innumerous As cedars proud on Canaan's verdant heights Dark'ning their idols, when Astarte lur'd Too prosp'rous Israel from his living strength. And next regard yon venerable dome, Which virtuous Latium, with erroneous aim, Rais'd to her various deities, and nam'd Pantheon; plain and round; of this our world Majestic emblem; with peculiar grace, Before its ample orb, projected stands The many-pillar'd portal: noblest work Of human skill: here, curious architect, If thou assay'st, ambitious, to surpass Palladius, Angelus, or British Jones, On these fair walls extend the certain scale, And turn th' instructive compass: careful mark How far in hidden art, the noble plain Extends, and where the lovely forms commence Of flowing sculpture: nor neglect to note How range the taper columns, and what weight Their leafy brows sustain: fair Corinth first Boasted their order, which Callimachus (Reclining studious on Asopus' banks Beneath an urn of some lamented nymph) Haply compos'd; the urn, with foliage curl'd Thinly conceal'd, the chapiter inform'd. See the tall obelisks from Memphis old, One stone enormous each, or Thebes convey'd; Like Albion's spires they rush into the skies. And there the temple, where the summon'd state In deep of night conven'd: ev'n yet, methinks, The vehement orator in rent attire Persuasion pours; ambition sinks her crest; And, lo! the villain, like a troubled sea, That tosses up her mire! Ever disguis'd, Shall Treason walk? shall proud Oppression yoke The neck of Virtue? Lo! the wretch, abash'd, Self-betray'd Catiline! O Liberty, Parent of happiness! celestial born; When the first man became a living soul, His sacred genius thou; be Britain's care; With her secure, prolong thy lov'd retreat; Thence bless mankind; while yet among her sons, Ev'n yet there are, to shield thine equal laws, Whose bosoms kindle at the sacred names Of Cecil, Raleigh, Walsingham, and Drake. May others more delight in tuneful airs; In masque and dance excel: to sculptur'd stone Give with superior skill the living look; More pompous piles erect, or pencil soft With warmer touch the visionary board: But thou, thy nobler Britons teach to rule; To check the ravage of tyrannic sway; To quell the proud; to spread the joys of peace, And various blessings of ingenious trade. Be these our arts; and ever may we guard, Ever defend thee with undaunted heart. Inestimable good! who giv'st us Truth, Whose hand upleads to light, divinest Truth, Array'd in ev'ry charm: whose hand benign Teaches unwearied Toil to clothe the fields, And on his various fruits inscribes the name Of Property: O nobly hail'd of old By thy majestic daughters, Judah fair, And Tyrus and Sidonia, lovely nymphs, And Libya bright, and all-enchanting Greece, Whose num'rous towns, and isles, and peopled seas, Rejoic'd around her lyre; th' heroic note (Smit with sublime delight) Ausonia caught, And plann'd imperial Rome. Thy hand benign Rear'd up her tow'ry battlements in strength; Bent her wide bridges o'er the swelling stream Of Tuscan Tiber; thine those solemn domes Devoted to the voice of humbler pray'r; And thine those piles undeck'd, capacious, vast, In days of dearth, where tender Charity Dispens'd her timely succours to the poor. Thine, too, those musically-falling founts To slake the clammy lip; adown they fall, Musical ever; while from yon blue hills, Dim in the clouds, the radiant aqueducts Turn their innumerable arches o'er The spacious desert, bright'ning in the sun, Proud and more proud in their august approach: High o'er irriguous vales and woods and towns, Glide the soft whispering waters in the wind, And here united pour their silver streams Among the figur'd rocks, in murm'ring falls, Musical ever. These thy beauteous works: And what beside felicity could tell Of human benefit: more late the rest; At various times their turrets chanc'd to rise, When impious Tyranny vouchsaf'd to smile. Behold by Tiber's flood, where modern Rome Couches beneath the ruins: there of old With arms and trophies gleam'd the field of Mars: There to their daily sports the noble youth Rush'd emulous; to fling the pointed lance; To vault the steed; or with the kindling wheel In dusty whirlwinds sweep the trembling goal; Or, wrestling, cope with adverse swelling breasts, Strong grappling arms, close heads, and distant feet; Or, clash the lifted gauntlets: there they form'd Their ardent virtues: in the bossy piles, The proud triumphal arches; all their wars, Their conquests, honours, in the sculptures live. And see from ev'ry gate those ancient roads, With tombs high verg'd, the solemn paths of Fame: Deserve they not regard? O'er whose broad flints Such crowds have roll'd, so many storms of war; So many pomps; so many wond'ring realms: Yet still through mountains pierc'd, o'er valleys rais'd, In even state, to distant seas around, They stretch their pavements. Lo, the fane of Peace, Built by that prince, who to the trust of pow'r Was honest, the delight of human kind. Three nodding aisles remain; the rest an heap Of sand and weeds; her shrines, her radiant roofs, And columns proud, that from her spacious floor, As from a shining sea, majestic rose An hundred foot aloft, like stately beech Around the brim of Dian's glassy lake, Charming the mimic painter: on the walls Hung Salem's sacred spoils; the golden board, And golden trumpets, now conceal'd, entomb'd By the sunk roof.âO'er which in distant view Th' Etruscan mountains swell, with ruins crown'd Of ancient towns; and blue Soracte spires, Wrapping his sides in tempests. Eastward hence, Nigh where the Cestian pyramid divides The mould'ring wall, behold yon fabric huge, Whose dust the solemn antiquarian turns, And thence, in broken sculptures cast abroad, Like Sibyl's leaves, collects the builder's name Rejoic'd; and the green medals, frequent found, Doom Caracalla to perpetual fame: The stately pines, that spread their branches wide In the dun ruins of its ample halls, Appear but tufts; as may whate'er is high Sink in comparison, minute and vile. These, and unnumber'd, yet their brows uplift, Reft of their graces; as Britannia's oaks On Merlin's mount, or Snowdon's rugged sides, Stand in the clouds, their branches scatter'd round, After the tempest; Mausoleums, Cirques, Naumachios, Forums: Trajan's column tall, From whose low base the sculptures wind aloft, And lead through various toils, up the rough steep, Its hero to the skies: and his dark tow'r Whose execrable hand the city fir'd, And, while the dreadful conflagration blaz'd, Play'd to the flames; and PhÅbus' letter'd dome; And the rough reliques of CarinÃ¦'s street, Where now the shepherd to his nibbling sheep Sits piping with his oaten reed; as erst There pip'd the shepherd to his nibbling sheep, When th' humble roof Anchises' son explor'd Of good Evander, wealth-despising king, Amid the thickets: so revolves the scene; So Time ordains, who rolls the things of pride From dust again to dust. Behold that heap Of mould'ring urns (their ashes blown away, Dust of the mighty) the same story tells; And at its base, from whence the serpent glides Down the green desert street, yon hoary monk Laments the same, the vision as he views, The solitary, silent, solemn scene, Where CÃ¦sars, heroes, peasants, hermits, lie, Blended in dust together; where the slave Rests from his labours; where th' insulting proud Resigns his pow'r; the miser drops his hoard; Where human folly sleeps.âThere is a mood, (I sing not to the vacant and the young) There is a kindly mood of Melancholy, That wings the soul, and points her to the skies; When tribulation clothes the child of man, When age descends with sorrow to the grave, 'Tis sweetly-soothing sympathy to pain, A gently wak'ning call to health and ease. How musical! when all-devouring Time, Here sitting on his throne of ruins hoar, With winds and zephyrs sweeps his various lyre, How sweet thy diapason, Melancholy! Cool ev'ning comes; the setting sun displays His visible great round between yon tow'rs, As through two shady cliffs; away, my Muse, Though yet the prospect pleases, ever new In vast variety, and yet delight The many-figur'd sculptures of the path Half beauteous, half effac'd; the traveller Such antique marbles to his native land Oft hence conveys; and ev'ry realm and state With Rome's august remains, heroes and gods, Deck their long galleries and winding groves; Yet miss we not th' innumerable thefts, Yet still profuse of graces teems the waste. Suffice it now th' Esquilian mount to reach With weary wing, and seek the sacred rest Of Maro's humble tenement; a low Plain wall remains; a little sun-gilt heap, Grotesque and wild; the gourd and olive brown Weave the light roof: the gourd and olive fan Their am'rous foliage, mingling with the vine, Who drops her purple clusters through the green. Here let me lie, with pleasing fancy sooth'd: Here flow'd his fountain; here his laurels grew; Here oft the meek good man, the lofty bard, Fram'd the celestial song, or social walk'd With Horace, and the ruler of the world: Happy Augustus! who, so well inspir'd, Couldst throw thy pomps and royalties aside, Attentive to the wise, the great of soul, And dignify thy mind. Thrice glorious days, Auspicious to the Muses! then rever'd, Then hallow'd was the fount, or secret shade, Or open mountain, or whatever scene The poet chose to tune th' ennobling rhyme Melodious; ev'n the rugged sons of War, Ev'n the rude hinds rever'd the Poet's name. But nowâanother age, alas! is oursâ Yet will the Muse a little longer soar, Unless the clouds of care weigh down her wing, Since Nature's stores are shut with cruel hand, And each aggrieves his brother; since in vain The thirsty pilgrim at the fountain asks Th' o'erflowing wave.âEnoughâthe plaint disdain.â See'st thou yon fane? ev'n now incessant Time Sweeps her low mould'ring marbles to the dust; And PhÅbus' temple, nodding with its woods, Threatens huge ruin o'er the small rotund. 'Twas there beneath a fig-tree's umbrage broad, Th' astonish'd swains with rev'rend awe beheld Thee, O Quirinus, and thy brother-twin, Pressing the teat within a monster's grasp Sportive: while oft the gaunt and rugged wolf Turn'd her stretch'd neck, and form'd your tender limbs; So taught of Jove, ev'n the fell savage fed Your sacred infancies; your virtues, toils, The conquests, glories, of th' Ausonian state, Wrapp'd in their secret seeds. Each kindred soul, Robust and stout, ye grapple to your hearts, And little Rome appears. Her cots arise, Green twigs of osier weave the slender walls, Green rushes spread the roofs; and here and there Opens beneath the rock the gloomy cave. Elate with joy, Etruscan Tiber views Her spreading scenes enamelling his waves, Her huts and hollow dells, and flocks and herds, And gath'ring swains; and rolls his yellow car To Neptune's court with more majestic train. Her speedy growth alarms the states around Jealous; yet soon, by wond'rous virtue won, They sink into her bosom. From the plough Rose her dictators; fought, o'ercame, return'd, Yes, to the plough return'd, and hail'd their peers; For then no private pomp, no household state, The public only swell'd the gen'rous breast. Who has not heard the Fabian heroes sung? Dentatus' scars, or Mutius' flaming hand? How Manlius sav'd the capitol? the choice Of steady Regulus? As yet they stood, Simple of life; as yet seducing wealth Was unexplor'd, and shame of poverty Yet unimagin'dâShine not all the fields With various fruitage? murmur not the brooks Along the flow'ry valleys? They, content, Feasted at nature's hand, indelicate, Blithe, in their easy taste; and only sought To know their duties; that their only strife, Their gen'rous strife, and greatly to perform. They, through all shapes of peril and of pain, Intent on honour, dar'd in thickest death To snatch the glorious deed. Nor Trebia quell'd, Nor Thrasymene, nor CannÃ¦'s bloody field, Their dauntless courage; storming Hannibal In vain the thunder of the battle roll'd, The thunder of the battle they return'd Back on his Punic shores; 'till Carthage fell, And danger fled afar. The city gleam'd With precious spoils: alas, prosperity! Ah, baneful state! yet ebb'd not all their strength In soft luxurious pleasures; proud desire Of boundless sway, and fev'rish thirst of gold, Rous'd them again to battle. Beauteous Greece, Torn from her joys, in vain with languid arm Half raised her rusty shield; nor could avail The sword of Dacia, nor the Parthian dart; Nor yet the car of that fam'd British chief, Which seven brave years, beneath the doubtful wing Of vict'ry, dreadful roll'd its griding wheels Over the bloody war: the Roman arms Triumph'd, 'till Fame was silent of their foes. And now the world unrivall'd they enjoy'd In proud security: the crested helm, The plated greave and corselet hung unbrac'd; Nor clank'd their arms, the spear and sounding shield, But on the glitt'ring trophy to the wind. Dissolv'd in ease and soft delights they lie, 'Till ev'ry sun annoys, and ev'ry wind Has chilling force, and ev'ry rain offends: For now the frame no more is girt with strength Masculine, nor in lustiness of heart Laughs at the winter storm, and summer beam, Superior to their rage: enfeebling vice Withers each nerve, and opens every pore To painful feelings: flow'ry bow'rs they seek (As Ã¦ther prompts, as the sick sense approves) Or cool Nymphean grots; or tepid baths (Taught by the soft Ionians) they, along The lawny vale, of ev'ry beauteous stone, Pile in the roseate air with fond expense: Through silver channels glide the fragrant waves, And fall on silver beds crystalline down, Melodious murmuring: while Luxury Over their naked limbs, with wanton hand, Sheds roses, odours, sheds unheeded bane. Swift is the flight of wealth; unnumber'd wants, Brood of volupt'ousness, cry out aloud Necessity, and seek the splendid bribe; The citron board, the bowl emboss'd with gems, And tender foliage wildly wreath'd around Of seeming ivy, by that artful hand, Corinthian Thericles; whate'er is known Of rarest acquisition; Tyrian garbs, Neptunian Albion's high testaceous food, And flavour'd Chian wines, with incense fum'd To slake patrician thirst: for these, their rights In the vile streets they prostitute to sale; Their ancient rights, their dignities, their laws, Their native glorious freedom. Is there none, Is there no villain, that will bind the neck Stretch'd to the yoke? they come: the market throngs. But who has most by fraud or force amass'd? Who most can charm corruption with his doles? He be the monarch of the state; and lo! Didius, vile us'rer, through the crowd he mounts, Beneath his feet the Roman eagle cow'rs, And the red arrows fill his grasp uncouth. O Britons, O my countrymen, beware, Gird, gird your hearts; the Romans once were free, Were brave, were virtuous.âTyranny howe'er Deign'd to walk forth awhile in pageant state, And with licentious pleasures fed the rout, The thoughtless many: to the wanton sound Of fifes and drums they danc'd, or in the shade Sung CÃ¦sar, great and terrible in war, Immortal CÃ¦sar! lo, a God, a God, He cleaves the yielding skies! CÃ¦sar meanwhile Gathers the ocean pebbles; or the gnat Enrag'd pursues; or at his lonely meal Starves a wide province; tastes, dislikes, and flings To dogs and sycophants: a God, a God! The flow'ry shades and shrines obscene return. But see along the north the tempest swell O'er the rough Alps, and darken all their snows! Sudden the Goth and Vandal, dreaded names, Rush as the breach of waters, whelming all Their domes, their villas: down the festive piles, Down fall their Parian porches, gilded baths, And roll before the storm in clouds of dust. Vain end of human strength, of human skill, Conquest, and triumph, and domain, and pomp, And ease, and luxury! O luxury, Bane of elated life, of affluent states, What dreary change, what ruin is not thine? How doth thy bowl intoxicate the mind! To the soft entrance of thy rosy cave How dost thou lure the fortunate and great! Dreadful attraction! while behind thee gapes Th' unfathomable gulph where Ashur lies O'erwhelm'd, forgotten; and high-boasting Cham; And Elam's haughty pomp: and beauteous Greece; And the great queen of earth, imperial Rome. THE FLEECE. âPost majores quadrupedes ovilli pecoris secunda ratio est, quÃ¦ prima sit, si ad utilitatis magnitudinem referas: nam id prÃ¦cipue nos contra frigoris violentiam protegit, corporibusque nostris liberaliora prÃ¦bet velamina.â âColumella.

The care of Sheep, the labours of the Loom, And arts of Trade, I sing. Ye rural nymphs, Ye swains, and princely merchants, aid the verse. And ye, high-trusted guardians of our isle, Whom public voice approves, or lot of birth To the great charge assigns: ye good, of all Degrees, all sects, be present to my song. So may distress, and wretchedness, and want, The wide felicities of labour learn: So may the proud attempts of restless Gaul From our strong borders, like a broken wave, In empty foam retire. But chiefly Thou, The people's shepherd, eminently plac'd Over the num'rous swains of ev'ry vale, With well-permitted pow'r and watchful eye, On each gay field to shed beneficence, Celestial office!âThou protect the song. On spacious airy downs, and gentle hills, With grass and thyme o'erspread, and clover wild, Where smiling PhÅbus tempers ev'ry breeze, The fairest flocks rejoice! they, nor of halt, Hydropic tumours, nor of rot, complain; Evils deform'd and foul: nor with hoarse cough Disturb the music of the past'ral pipe: But, crowding to the note, with silence soft The close-wov'n carpet graze; where nature blends Flowrets and herbage of minutest size, Innoxious luxury. Wide airy downs Are Health's gay walks to shepherd and to sheep. All arid soils, with sand, or chalky flint, Or shells deluvian mingled; and the turf, That mantles over rocks of brittle stone, Be thy regard: and where low-tufted broom, Or box, or berry'd juniper arise; Or the tall growth of glossy-rinded beech; And where the burrowing rabbit turns the dust; And where the dappled deer delights to bound. Such are the downs of Banstead, edg'd with woods, And tow'ry villas; such Dorcestrian fields, Whose flocks innum'rous whiten all the land: Such those slow-climbing wilds, that lead the step Insensibly to Dover's windy cliff, Tremendous height! and such the clover'd lawns And sunny mounts of beauteous Normanton, Health's cheerful haunt, and the selected walk Of Heathcote's leisure: such the spacious plain Of Sarum, spread like ocean's boundless round, Where solitary Stonehenge, grey with moss, Ruin of ages, nods: such too the leas And ruddy tilth, which spiry Ross beholds, From a green hillock, o'er her lofty elms; And Lemster's brooky tract, and airy Croft; And such Harleian Eywood's swelling turf, Wav'd as the billows of a rolling sea: And Shobden, for its lofty terrace fam'd, Which from a mountain's ridge, elate o'er woods, And girt with all Siluria, sees around Regions on regions blended in the clouds. Pleasant Siluria, land of various views, Hills, rivers, woods, and lawns, and purple groves Pomaceous, mingled with the curling growth Of tendril hops, that flaunt upon their poles, More airy wild than vines along the sides Of treacherous Falernum; or that hill Vesuvius, where the bow'rs of Bacchus rose, And Herculanean and Pompeian domes. But if thy prudent care would cultivate Leicestrian fleeces, what the sinewy arm Combs through the spiky steel in lengthen'd flakes; Rich saponaceous loam, that slowly drinks The black'ning show'r, and fattens with the draught, Or marl with clay deep-mix'd, be then thy choice, Of one consistence, one complexion, spread Through all thy glebe; where no deceitful veins Of envious gravel lurk beneath the turf, To loose the creeping waters from their springs, Tainting the pasturage: and let thy fields In slopes descend and mount, that chilling rains May trickle off, and hasten to the brooks. Yet some defect in all on earth appears; All seek for help, all press for social aid. Too cold the grassy mantle of the marl, In stormy winter's long and dreary nights, For cumbent sheep; from broken slumber oft They rise benumb'd, and vainly shift the couch; Their wasted sides their evil plight declare. Hence, tender in his care, the shepherd swain Seeks each contrivance. Here it would avail, At a meet distance from the upland ridge, To sink a trench, and on the hedge-long bank Sow frequent sand, with lime, and dark manure, Which to the liquid element will yield A porous way, a passage to the foe. Plough not such pastures: deep in spongy grass The oldest carpet is the warmest lair, And soundest; in new herbage coughs are heard. Nor love too frequent shelter: such as decks The vale of Severn, nature's garden wide, By the blue steeps of distant Malvern wall'd, Solemnly vast. The trees of various shade, Scene behind scene, with fair delusive pomp Enrich the prospect, but they rob the lawns. Nor prickly brambles, white with woolly theft, Should tuft thy fields. Applaud not the remiss Dimetians, who along their mossy dales Consume, like grasshoppers, the summer hour; While round them stubborn thorns and furze increase, And creeping briars. I knew a careful swain, Who gave them to the crackling flames, and spread Their dust saline upon the deep'ning grass: And oft with labour-strengthen'd arm he delv'd The draining trench across his verdant slopes, To intercept the small meand'ring rills Of upper hamlets: haughty trees, that sour The shaded grass, that weaken thorn-set mounds, And harbour villain crows, he rare allow'd: Only a slender tuft of useful ash, And mingled beech and elm, securely tall, The little smiling cottage warm embower'd; The little smiling cottage, where at eve He meets his rosy children at the door, Prattling their welcomes, and his honest wife, With good brown cake and bacon slice, intent To cheer his hunger after labour hard. Nor only soil, there also must be found Felicity of clime, and aspect bland, Where gentle sheep may nourish locks of price. In vain the silken fleece on windy brows, And northern slopes of cloud-dividing hills Is sought, though soft Iberia spreads her lap Beneath their rugged feet, and names their heights Biscaian, or Segovian. Bothnic realms, And dark Norwegian, with their choicest fields, Dingles, and dells, by lofty fir embower'd, In vain the bleaters court. Alike they shun Libya's hot plains; what taste have they for groves Of palm, or yellow dust of gold? no more Food to the flock, than to the miser wealth, Who kneels upon the glittering heap, and starves. Ev'n Gallic Abbeville the shining fleece, That richly decorates her loom, acquires Basely from Albion, by th' ensnaring bribe, The bait of av'rice, which, with felon fraud For its own wanton mouth, from thousands steals. How erring oft the judgment in its hate, Or fond desire! Those slow-descending show'rs, Those hov'ring fogs, that bathe our growing vales In deep November (loath'd by trifling Gaul, Effeminate), are gifts the Pleiads shed, Britannia's handmaids. As the bev'rage falls, Her hills rejoice, her valleys laugh and sing. Hail, noble Albion! where no golden mines, No soft perfumes, nor oils, nor myrtle bow'rs, The vig'rous frame and lofty heart of man Enervate: round whose stern cerulean brows White-winged snow, and cloud, and pearly rain, Frequent attend, with solemn majesty; Rich queen of mists and vapours! These thy sons With their cool arms compress, and twist their nerves For deeds of excellence and high renown. Thus form'd, our Edwards, Henrys, Churchills, Blakes, Our Lockes, our Newtons, and our Miltons, rose. See the sun gleams; the living pastures rise, After the nurture of the fallen show'r, How beautiful! how blue th' ethereal vault; How verdurous the lawns, how clear the brooks! Such noble warlike steeds, such herds of kine, So sleek, so vast; such spacious flocks of sheep, Like flakes of gold illumining the green, What other paradise adorn but thine, Britannia? happy, if thy sons would know Their happiness. To these thy naval streams, Thy frequent towns superb of busy trade, And ports magnific add, and stately ships, Innumerous. But whither strays my muse? Pleas'd, like a traveller upon the strand Arriv'd of bright Augusta; wild he roves From deck to deck, through groves immense of masts; 'Mong crowds, bales, cars, the wealth of either Ind; Through wharfs, and squares, and palaces, and domes, In sweet surprise; unable yet to fix His raptur'd mind, or scan in order'd course Each object singly; with discov'ries new His native country studious to enrich. Ye shepherds, if your labours hope success, Be first your purpose to procure a breed To soil and clime adapted. Ev'ry soil And clime, ev'n ev'ry tree and herb, receives Its habitant peculiar: each to each, The Great Invisible, and each to all, Through earth, and sea, and air, harmonious suits. Tempestuous regions, Darwent's naked peaks, Snowdon and blue Plynlymmon, and the wide Aerial sides of Cader-yddris huge; These are bestow'd on goat-horn'd sheep, of fleece Hairy and coarse, of long and nimble shank, Who rove o'er bog or heath, and graze or browse Alternate, to collect, with due dispatch, O'er the bleak wild, the thinly-scatter'd meal. But hills of milder air, that gently rise O'er dewy dales, a fairer species boast, Of shorter limb, and frontlet more ornate; Such the Silurian. If thy farm extends Near Cotswold downs, or the delicious groves Of Symmonds, honour'd through the sandy soil Of elmy Ross, or Devon's myrtle vales, That drink clear rivers near the glassy sea; Regard this sort, and hence thy sire of lambs Select: his tawny fleece in ringlets curls; Long swings his slender tail; his front is fenc'd With horns Ammonian, circulating twice Around each open ear, like those fair scrolls That grace the columns of th' IÃ¶nic dome. Yet should thy fertile glebe be marly clay, Like Melton pastures, or Tripontian fields, Where ever-gliding Avon's limpid wave Thwarts the long course of dusty Watling-street; That larger sort, of head defenceless, seek, Whose fleece is deep and clammy, close and plain: The ram short-limb'd, whose form compact describes One level line along his spacious back; Of full and ruddy eye, large ears, stretch'd head, Nostrils dilated, breast and shoulders broad, And spacious haunches, and a lofty dock. Thus to their kindred soil and air induc'd, Thy thriving herd will bless thy skilful care, That copies nature; who, in ev'ry change, In each variety, with wisdom works, And pow'rs diversified of air and soil, Her rich materials. Hence SabÃ¦a's rocks, ChaldÃ¦a's marle, Ãgyptus' water'd loam, And dry Cyrene's sand, in climes alike, With diff'rent stores supply the marts of trade. Hence Zembla's icy tracts no bleaters hear; Small are the Russian herds, and harsh their fleece: Of light esteem Germanic, far remote From soft sea-breezes, open winters mild, And summers bath'd in dew: on Syrian sheep The costly burden only loads their tails: No locks Cormandel's, none Malacca's tribe Adorn; but sleek of flix, and brown like deer, Fearful and shepherdless, they bound along The sands. No fleeces wave in torrid climes, Which verdure boast of trees and shrubs alone, Shrubs aromatic, coffee wild, or tea, Nutmeg, or cinnamon, or fiery clove, Unapt to feed the fleece. The food of wool Is grass or herbage soft, that ever blooms In temp'rate air, in the delicious downs Of Albion, on the banks of all her streams. Of grasses are unnumber'd kinds, and all (Save where foul waters linger on the turf) Salubrious. Early mark, when tepid gleams Oft mingle with the pearls of summer show'rs, And swell too hastily the tender plains: Then snatch away thy sheep; beware the rot; And with detersive bay-salt rub their mouths; Or urge them on a barren bank to feed, In hunger's kind distress, on tedded hay; Or to the marish guide their easy steps, If near thy tufted crofts the broad sea spreads. Sagacious care foreacts: when strong disease Breaks in, and stains the purple streams of health, Hard is the strife of art: the coughing pest From their green pasture sweeps whole flocks away. That dire distemper sometimes may the swain, Though late, discern; when, on the lifted lid, Or visual orb, the turgid veins are pale; The swelling liver then her putrid store Begins to drink: ev'n yet thy skill exert, Nor suffer weak despair to fold thy arms: Again detersive salt apply, or shed The hoary med'cine o'er their arid food. In cold stiff soils the bleaters oft complain Of gouty ails, by shepherds term'd the halt: Those let the neighb'ring fold, or ready crook, Detain; and pour into their cloven feet Corrosive drugs, deep-searching arsenic, Dry alum, verdigris, or vitriol keen. But if the doubtful mischief scarce appears, 'Twill serve to shift them to a drier turf, And salt again: th' utility of salt Teach thy slow swains: redundant humours cold Are the diseases of the bleating kind. Th' infectious scab, arising from extremes Of want or surfeit, is by water cur'd Of lime, or sodden stave-acre, or oil Dispersive of Norwegian tar, renown'd By virtuous Berkeley, whose benevolence Explor'd its pow'rs, and easy med'cine thence Sought for the poor: ye poor, with grateful voice, Invoke eternal blessings on his head. Sheep also pleurisies and dropsies know, Driv'n oft from nature's path by artful man, Who blindly turns aside, with haughty hand, Whom sacred instinct would securely lead. But thou, more humble swain, thy rural gates Frequent unbar, and let thy flocks abroad, From lea to croft, from mead to arid field; Noting the fickle seasons of the sky. Rain-sated pastures let them shun, and seek Changes of herbage and salubrious flow'rs. By their all-perfect Master inly taught, They best their food and physic can discern; For He, Supreme Existence, ever near, Informs them. O'er the vivid green observe With what a regular consent they crop, At ev'ry fourth collection to the mouth, Unsav'ry crow-flow'r; whether to awake Languor of appetite with lively change, Or timely to repel approaching ills, Hard to determine. Thou, whom nature loves, And with her salutary rules entrusts, Benevolent Mackenzie, say the cause. This truth, howe'er, shines bright to human sense; Each strong affection of th' unconscious brute, Each bent, each passion of the smallest mite, Is wisely giv'n; harmonious they perform The work of perfect reason, (blush, vain man,) And turn the wheels of nature's vast machine. See that thy scrip have store of healing tar, And marking pitch and raddle; nor forget Thy sheers true pointed, nor th' officious dog Faithful to teach thy stragglers to return: So mayst thou aid who lag along, or steal Aside into the furrows or the shades, Silent to droop; or who, at ev'ry gate, Or hillock, rub their sores and loosen'd wool. But rather these, the feeble of thy flock, Banish before th' autumnal months: ev'n age Forbear too much to favour; oft renew, And through thy fold let joyous youth appear. Beware the season of imperial love, Who through the world his ardent spirit pours; Ev'n sheep are then intrepid: the proud ram With jealous eye surveys the spacious field; All rivals keep aloof, or desp'rate war Suddenly rages; with impetuous force, And fury irresistible, they dash Their hardy frontlets; the wide vale resounds; The flock amaz'd stands safe afar; and oft Each to the other's might a victim falls: As fell of old, before that engine's sway, Which hence Ambition imitative wrought, The beauteous tow'rs of Salem to the dust. Wise custom, at the fifth or sixth return, Or ere they've past the twelfth of orient morn, Castrates the lambkins; necessary rite, Ere they be number'd of the peaceful herd. But kindly watch whom thy sharp hand has griev'd, In those rough months, that lift the turning year: Not tedious is the office; to thy aid Favonius hastens; soon their wounds he heals, And leads them skipping to the flow'rs of May; May, who allows to fold, if poor the tilth, Like that of dreary, houseless, common fields, Worn by the plough: but fold on fallows dry; Enfeeble not thy flock to feed thy land: Nor in too narrow bounds the pris'ners crowd: Nor ope the wattled fence, while balmy morn Lies on the reeking pasture; wait till all The crystal dews, impearl'd upon the grass, Are touch'd by PhÅbus' beams, and mount aloft, With various clouds to paint the azure sky. In teasing fly-time, dank, or frosty days, With unctuous liquids, or the lees of oil, Rub their soft skins, between the parted locks; Thus the Brigantes; 'tis not idle pains: Nor is that skill despis'd, which trims their tails, Ere summer heats, of filth and tagged wool. Coolness and cleanliness to health conduce. To mend thy mounds, to trench, to clear, to soil Thy grateful fields, to medicate thy sheep, Hurdles to weave, and cheerly shelters raise, Thy vacant hours require: and ever learn Quick Ã¦ther's motions: oft the scene is turn'd; Now the blue vault, and now the murky cloud, Hail, rain, or radiance; these the moon will tell, Each bird and beast, and these thy fleecy tribe: When high the sapphire cope, supine they couch, And chew the cud delighted; but, ere rain, Eager, and at unwonted hour, they feed: Slight not the warning; soon the tempest rolls, Scatt'ring them wide, close rushing at the heels Of th' hurrying o'ertaken swains: forbear Such nights to fold; such nights be theirs to shift On ridge or hillock; or in homesteads soft, Or softer cotes, detain them. Is thy lot A chill penurious turf, to all thy toils Untractable? Before harsh winter drowns The noisy dykes, and starves the rushy glebe, Shift the frail breed to sandy hamlets warm: There let them sojourn, till gay Procne skims The thick'ning verdure, and the rising flow'rs. And while departing Autumn all embrowns The frequent-bitten fields; while thy free hand Divides the tedded hay; then be their feet Accustom'd to the barriers of the rick, Or some warm umbrage; lest, in erring fright, When the broad dazzling snows descend, they run Dispers'd to ditches, where the swelling drift Wide overwhelms: anxious, the shepherd swains Issue with axe and spade, and, all abroad, In doubtful aim explore the glaring waste; And some, perchance, in the deep delve upraise, Drooping, ev'n at the twelfth cold dreary day, With still continued feeble pulse of life; The glebe, their fleece, their flesh, by hunger gnaw'd. Ah, gentle shepherd, thine the lot to tend, Of all, that feel distress, the most assail'd, Feeble, defenceless: lenient be thy care: But spread around thy tend'rest diligence In flow'ry spring-time, when the new-dropt lamb, Tott'ring with weakness by his mother's side, Feels the fresh world about him; and each thorn, Hillock, or furrow, trips his feeble feet: O guard his meek sweet innocence from all Th' innum'rous ills, that rush around his life; Mark the quick kite, with beak and talons prone, Circling the skies to snatch him from the plain; Observe the lurking crows; beware the brake, There the sly fox the careless minute waits; Nor trust thy neighbour's dog, nor earth, nor sky: Thy bosom to a thousand cares divide. Eurus oft flings his hail; the tardy fields Pay not their promis'd food; and oft the dam O'er her weak twins with empty udder mourns, Or fails to guard, when the bold bird of prey Alights, and hops in many turns around, And tires her also turning: To her aid Be nimble, and the weakest, in thine arms, Gently convey to the warm cote, and oft, Between the lark's note and the nightingale's, His hungry bleating still with tepid milk: In this soft office may thy children join, And charitable habits learn in sport: Nor yield him to himself, ere vernal airs Sprinkle thy little croft with daisy flow'rs: Nor yet forget him: life has rising ills: Various as Ã¦ther is the past'ral care: Through slow experience, by a patient breast, The whole long lesson gradual is attain'd, By precept after precept, oft received With deep attention: such as Nuceus sings To the full vale near Soar's enamour'd brook, While all is silence: sweet Hinclean swain! Whom rude obscurity severely clasps: The muse, howe'er, will deck thy simple cell With purple violets and primrose flow'rs, Well-pleas'd thy faithful lessons to repay. Sheep no extremes can bear: both heat and cold Spread sores cutaneous; but, more frequent, heat: The fly-blown vermin, from their woolly nest, Press to the tortur'd skin, and flesh, and bone, In littleness and number dreadful foes. Long rains in miry winter cause the halt; Rainy luxuriant summers rot your flock; And all excess, ev'n of salubrious food, As sure destroys, as famine or the wolf. Inferior theirs to man's world-roving frame, Which all extremes in ev'ry zone endures. With grateful heart, ye British swains, enjoy Your gentle seasons and indulgent clime. Lo, in the sprinkling clouds, your bleating hills Rejoice with herbage, while the horrid rage Of winter irresistible o'erwhelms Th' Hyperborean tracts: his arrowy frosts, That pierce through flinty rocks, the Lappian flies; And burrows deep beneath the snowy world; A drear abode, from rose-diffusing hours, That dance before the wheels of radiant day, Far, far remote; where, by the squalid light Of fÅtid oil inflam'd, sea monster's spume, Or fir-wood, glaring in the weeping vault, Twice three slow gloomy months, with various ills Sullen he struggles; such the love of life! His lank and scanty herds around him press, As, hunger-stung, to gritty meal he grinds The bones of fish, or inward bark of trees, Their common sustenance. While ye, O swains, Ye, happy at your ease, behold your sheep Feed on the open turf, or crowd the tilth, Where, thick among the greens, with busy mouths They scoop white turnips: little care is yours; Only, at morning hour, to interpose Dry food of oats, or hay, or brittle straw, The wat'ry juices of the bossy root Absorbing: or from noxious air to screen Your heavy teeming ewes, with wattled fence Of furze or copse-wood, in the lofty field, Which bleak ascends among the whistling winds. Or, if your sheep are of Silurian breed, Nightly to house them dry on fern or straw, Silk'ning their fleeces. Ye, nor rolling hut, Nor watchful dog, require; where never roar Of savage tears the air, where careless night In balmy sleep lies lull'd, and only wakes To plenteous peace. Alas! o'er warmer zones Wild terror strides: their stubborn rocks are rent; Their mountains sink; their yawning caverns flame; And fiery torrents roll impetuous down, Proud cities deluging; Pompeian tow'rs, And Herculanean, and what riotous stood In Syrian valley, where now the Dead Sea 'Mong solitary hills infectious lies. See the swift furies, Famine, Plague, and War, In frequent thunders rage o'er neighb'ring realms, And spread their plains with desolation wide: Let your mild homesteads, ever-blooming, smile Among embracing woods; and waft on high The breath of plenty, from the ruddy tops Of chimneys, curling o'er the gloomy trees, In airy, azure ringlets, to the sky. Nor ye by need are urg'd, as Attic swains, And Tarentine, with skins to clothe your sheep; Expensive toil; howe'er expedient found In fervid climates, while from PhÅbus' beams They fled to rugged woods and tangling brakes. But those expensive toils are now no more, Proud tyranny devours their flocks and herds: Nor bleat of sheep may now, nor sound of pipe, Soothe the sweet plains of once sweet Arcady, The shepherds' kingdom: dreary solitude Spreads o'er Hymettus, and the shaggy vale Of Athens, which, in solemn silence, sheds Her venerable ruins to the dust. The weary Arabs roam from plain to plain, Guiding the languid herd in quest of food; And shift their little home's uncertain scene With frequent farewell: strangers, pilgrims all, As were their fathers. No sweet fall of rain May there be heard; nor sweeter liquid lapse Of river, o'er the pebbles gliding by In murmurs: goaded by the rage of thirst, Daily they journey to the distant clefts Of craggy rocks, where gloomy palms o'erhang The ancient wells, deep sunk by toil immense, Toil of the patriarchs, with sublime intent Themselves and long posterity to serve. There, at the public hour of sultry noon, They share the bev'rage, when to wat'ring come, And grateful umbrage, all the tribes around, And their lean flocks, whose various bleatings fill The echoing caverns: then is absent none, Fair nymph or shepherd, each inspiring each To wit, and song, and dance, and active feats; In the same rustic scene, where Jacob won Fair Rachel's bosom, when a rock's vast weight From the deep dark-mouth'd well his strength remov'd, And to her circling sheep refreshment gave. Such are the perils, such the toils of life, In foreign climes. But speed thy flight, my Muse; Swift turns the year; and our unnumber'd flocks On fleeces overgrown uneasy lie. Now, jolly swains, the harvest of your cares Prepare to reap, and seek the sounding caves Of high Brigantium, where, by ruddy flames, Vulcan's strong sons, with nervous arm, around The steady anvil and the glaring mass, Clatter their heavy hammers down by turns, Flatt'ning the steel: from their rough hands receive The sharpen'd instrument, that from the flock Severs the fleece. If verdant elder spreads Her silver flow'rs; if humble daisies yield To yellow crow-foot, and luxuriant grass, Gay shearing-time approaches. First, howe'er, Drive to the double fold, upon the brim Of a clear river, gently drive the flock, And plunge them one by one into the flood; Plung'd in the flood, not long the struggler sinks, With his white flakes, that glisten through the tide; The sturdy rustic, in the middle wave, Awaits to seize him rising; one arm bears His lifted head above the limpid stream, While the full clammy fleece the other laves Around, laborious, with repeated toil; And then resigns him to the sunny bank, Where, bleating loud, he shakes his dripping locks. Shear them the fourth or fifth return of morn, Lest touch of busy fly-blows wound their skin: Thy peaceful subjects without murmur yield Their yearly tribute: 'tis the prudent part To cherish and be gentle, while ye strip The downy vesture from their tender sides. Press not too close; with caution turn the points; And from the head in reg'lar rounds proceed: But speedy, when ye chance to wound, with tar Prevent the wingy swarm and scorching heat; And careful house them, if the low'ring clouds Mingle their stores tumultuous: through the gloom Then thunder oft with pond'rous wheels rolls loud, And breaks the crystal urns of heav'n: adown Falls streaming rain. Sometimes among the steeps Of Cambrian glades, (pity the Cambrian glades) Fast tumbling brooks on brooks enormous swell, And sudden overwhelm their vanish'd fields: Down with the flood away the naked sheep, Bleating in vain, are borne, and straw-built huts, And rifted trees, and heavy, enormous rocks, Down with the rapid torrent to the deep. At shearing-time, along the lively vales, Rural festivities are often heard: Beneath each blooming arbour all is joy And lusty merriment: while on the grass The mingled youth in gaudy circles sport, We think the golden age again return'd, And all the fabled Dryades in dance. Leering they bound along, with laughing air, To the shrill pipe, and deep remurm'ring cords Of th' ancient harp, or tabor's hollow sound. While th' old apart, upon a bank reclin'd, Attend the tuneful carol, softly mixt With ev'ry murmur of the sliding wave, And ev'ry warble of the feather'd choir; Music of paradise! which still is heard, When the heart listens; still the views appear Of the first happy garden, when Content To Nature's flow'ry scenes directs the sight. Yet we abandon those Elysian walks, Then idly for the lost delight repine: As greedy mariners, whose desp'rate sails Skim o'er the billows of the foamy flood, Fancy they see the less'ning shores retire, And sigh a farewell to the sinking hills. Could I recall those notes, which once the Muse Heard at a shearing, near the woody sides Of blue-topp'd Wreakin. Yet the carols sweet, Through the deep maze of the memorial cell, Faintly remurmur. First arose in song Hoar-headed Damon, venerable swain, The soothest shepherd of the flow'ry vale. âThis is no vulgar scene: no palace roof Was e'er so lofty, nor so nobly rise Their polish'd pillars, as these aged oaks, Which, o'er our fleecy wealth and harmless sports Thus have expanded wide their shelt'ring arms, Thrice told an hundred summers. Sweet Content, Ye gentle shepherds, pillows us at night.â âYes, tuneful Damon, for our cares are short, Rising and falling with the cheerful day,â Colin reply'd, âand pleasing weariness Soon our unaching heads to sleep inclines. Is it in cities so? where, poets tell, The cries of sorrow sadden all the streets, And the diseases of intemp'rate wealth. Alas, that any ills from wealth should rise! âMay the sweet nightingale on yonder spray, May this clear stream, these lawns, those snow-white lambs, Which, with a pretty innocence of look, Skip on the green, and race in little troops; May that great lamp, which sinks behind the hills, And streams around variety of lights, Recall them erring: this is Damon's wish. âHuge Breaden's stony summit once I climb'd After a kidling: Damon, what a scene! What various views unnumber'd spread beneath! Woods, tow'rs, vales, caves, dells, cliffs, and torrent floods; And here and there, between the spiry rocks, The broad flat sea. Far nobler prospects these, Than gardens black with smoke in dusty towns, Where stenchy vapours often blot the sun: Yet flying from his quiet, thither crowds Each greedy wretch for tardy-rising wealth, Which comes too late; that courts the taste in vain, Or nauseates with distempers. Yes, ye rich, Still, still be rich, if thus ye fashion life; And piping, careless, silly shepherds we, We silly shepherds, all intent to feed Our snowy flocks, and wind the sleeky fleece.â âDeem not, howe'er, our occupation mean,â Damon replied, âwhile the Supreme accounts Well of the faithful shepherd, rank'd alike With king and priest: they also shepherds are; For so th' All-seeing styles them, to remind Elated man, forgetful of his charge.â âBut haste, begin the rites: see purple Eve Stretches her shadows: all ye nymphs and swains Hither assemble. Pleas'd with honours due, Sabrina, guardian of the crystal flood, Shall bless our cares, when she by moonlight clear Skims o'er the dales, and eyes our sleeping folds: Or in hoar caves, around Plynlymmon's brow, Where precious min'rals dart their purple gleams, Among her sisters she reclines; the lov'd Vaga, profuse of graces, Ryddol rough, Blithe Ystwith, and Clevedoc swift of foot; And mingles various seeds of flow'rs, and herbs, In the divided torrents, ere they burst Through the dark clouds, and down the mountain roll. Nor taint-worm shall infect the yearning herds, Nor penny-grass, nor spearwort's poisonous leaf.â He said: with light fantastic toe, the nymphs Thither assembled, thither ev'ry swain; And o'er the dimpled stream a thousand flow'rs, Pale lilies, roses, violets, and pinks, Mix'd with the greens of burnet, mint, and thyme, And trefoil, sprinkled with their sportive arms. Such custom holds along th' irriguous vales, From Wreakin's brow to rocky Dolvoryn, Sabrina's early haunt, ere yet she fled The search of Guendolen, her stepdame proud, With envious hate enrag'd. The jolly cheer, Spread on a mossy bank, untouch'd abides, Till cease the rites: and now the mossy bank Is gaily circled, and the jolly cheer Dispers'd in copious measure; early fruits, And those of frugal store, in husk or rind; Steep'd grain, and curdled milk with dulcet cream Soft temper'd, in full merriment they quaff, And cast about their gibes; and some apace Whistle to roundelays: their little ones Look on delighted; while the mountain-woods, And winding valleys, with the various notes Of pipe, sheep, kine, and birds, and liquid brooks, Unite their echoes: near at hand, the wide Majestic wave of Severn slowly rolls Along the deep-divided glebe: the flood, And trading bark with low contracted sail, Linger among the reeds and copsy banks To listen; and to view the joyous scene.

Now, of the sever'd lock begin the song, With various numbers, through the simple theme To win attention: this, ye shepherd swains, This is a labour. Yet, O Wray, if thou Cease not with skilful hand to point her way, The lark-wing'd Muse, above the grassy vale, And hills, and woods, shall, singing, soar aloft; And he, whom learning, wisdom, candour, grace, Who glows with all the virtues of his sire, Royston approve, and patronize the strain. Through all the brute creation, none, as sheep, To lordly man such ample tribute pay. For him their udders yield nectareous streams: For him their downy vestures they resign; For him they spread the feast: ah! ne'er may he Glory in wants, which doom to pain and death His blameless fellow-creatures. Let disease, Let wasted hunger, by destroying live; And the permission use with trembling thanks, Meekly reluctant: 'tis the brute beyond: And gluttons ever murder, when they kill. Ev'n to the reptile ev'ry cruel deed Is high impiety. Howe'er, not all, Not of the sanguinary tribe are all; All are not savage. Come, ye gentle swains, Like Brama's healthy sons on Indus' banks, Whom the pure stream and garden fruits sustain, Ye are the sons of Nature; your mild hands Are innocent: ye, when ye shear, relieve. Come, gentle swains, the bright unsullied locks Collect: alternate songs shall soothe your cares, And warbling music break from ev'ry spray. Be faithful; and the genuine locks alone Wrap round: nor alien flake, nor pitch enfold: Stain not your stores with base desire to add Fallacious weight: nor yet, to mimic those, Minute and light, of sandy Urchinfield, Lessen, with subtle artifice, the fleece: Equal the fraud. Nor interpose delay, Lest busy Ã¦ther through the open wool Debilitating pass, and ev'ry film Ruffle and sully with the valley's dust. Guard, too, from moisture, and the fretting moth Pernicious: she, in gloomy shade conceal'd, Her lab'rinth cuts, and mocks the comber's care. But in loose locks of fells she most delights, And feeble fleeces of distemper'd sheep, Whither she hastens, by the morbid scent Allur'd; as the swift eagle to the fields Of slaught'ring war, or carnage: such apart Keep for their proper use. Our ancestors Selected such, for hospitable beds To rest the stranger, or the gory chief, From battle, or the chase of wolves, return'd. When many-colour'd ev'ning sinks behind The purple woods and hills, and opposite Rises, full-orb'd, the silver harvest-moon, To light th' unwearied farmer, late afield His scatter'd sheaves collecting; then expect The artists, bent on speed, from pop'lous Leeds, Norwich, or Froome; they traverse ev'ry plain, And ev'ry dale, where farm or cottage smokes: Reject them not; and let the season's price Win thy soft treasures: let the bulky wain Through dusty roads roll nodding; or the bark, That silently adown the cerule stream Glides with white sails, dispense the downy freight To copsy villages on either side, And spiry towns, where ready diligence, The grateful burden to receive, awaits, Like strong Briareus, with his hundred hands. In the same fleece diversity of wool Grows intermingled, and excites the care Of curious skill to sort the sev'ral kinds. But in this subtle science none exceed Th' industrious Belgians, to the work who guide Each feeble hand of want: their spacious domes With boundless hospitality receive Each nation's outcasts: there the tender eye May view the maim'd, the blind, the lame, employ'd, And unrejected age; ev'n childhood there Its little fingers turning to the toil Delighted; nimbly, with habitual speed, They sever lock from lock, and long, and short, And soft, and rigid, pile in sev'ral heaps. This the dusk hatter asks; another shines, Tempting the clothier; that the hosier seeks; The long bright lock is apt for airy stuffs; But often it deceives the artist's care, Breaking unuseful in the steely comb; For this long spongy wool no more increase Receives, while Winter petrifies the fields; The growth of Autumn stops; and what though Spring Succeeds with rosy finger, and spins on The texture? yet in vain she strives to link The silver twine to that of Autumn's hand. Be then the swain advis'd to shield his flocks From Winter's dead'ning frosts and whelming snows: Let the loud tempest rattle on the roof, While they, secure within, warm cribs enjoy, And swell their fleeces, equal to the worth Of cloth'd Apulian, by soft warmth improv'd: Or let them inward heat and vigour find, By food of cole or turnip, hardy plants. Besides, the lock of one continued growth Imbibes a clearer and more equal dye. But lightest wool is theirs, who poorly toil, Through a dull round, in unimproving farms Of common-fields: inclose, inclose, ye swains; Why will you joy in common-field, where pitch, Noxious to wool, must stain your motley flock, To mark your property? The mark dilates, Enters the flake depreciated, defil'd, Unfit for beauteous tint: besides, in fields Promiscuous held, all culture languishes; The glebe, exhausted, thin supply receives; Dull waters rest upon the rushy flats And barren furrows: none the rising grove There plants for late posterity, nor hedge To shield the flock, nor copse for cheering fire; And, in the distant village, ev'ry hearth Devours the grassy sward, the verdant food Of injur'd herds and flocks, or what the plough Should turn and moulder for the bearded grain: Pernicious habit, drawing gradual on Increasing beggary and nature's frowns. Add too, the idle pilf'rer easier there Eludes detection, when a lamb or ewe From intermingled flocks he steals; or when, With loosened tether of his horse or cow, The milky stalk of the tall green-ear'd corn, The year's slow-rip'ning fruit, the anxious hope Of his laborious neighbour he destroys. There are, who over-rate our spongy stores, Who deem that nature grants no clime but ours, To spread upon its fields the dews of heaven, And feed the silky fleece; that card, nor comb, The hairy wool of Gaul can e'er subdue, To form the thread, and mingle in the loom, Unless a third from Britain swell the heap: Illusion all: though of our sun and air Not trivial is the virtue: nor their fruit, Upon our snowy flocks, of small esteem; The grain of brightest tincture none so well Imbibes: the wealthy Gobelins must to this Bear witness, and the costliest of their looms. And though, with hue of crocus or of rose, No pow'r of subtle food, or air, or soil, Can dye the living fleece; yet 'twill avail To note their influence in the tinging vase. Therefore from herbage of old-pastur'd plains, Chief from the matted turf of azure marle, Where grow the whitest locks, collect thy stores. Those fields regard not, through whose recent turf The miry soil appears: not ev'n the streams Of Yare, or silver Stroud, can purify Their frequent-sully'd fleece; nor what rough winds, Keen-biting on tempestuous hills, imbrown. Yet much may be perform'd, to check the force Of nature's rigor: the high heath, by trees Warm-shelter'd, may despise the rage of storms: Moors, bogs, and weeping fens, may learn to smile, And leave in dykes their soon-forgotten tears. Labour and art will ev'ry aim achieve Of noble bosoms. Bedford Level, erst A dreary pathless waste, the coughing flock Was wont with hairy fleeces to deform; And, smiling with her lure of summer flow'rs, The heavy ox, vain-struggling, to ingulph; Till one, of that high-honour'd patriot name, Russel, arose, who drain'd the rushy fen, Confin'd the waves, bid groves and gardens bloom, And through his new creation led the Ouze, And gentle Camus, silver-winding streams: Godlike beneficence: from chaos drear To raise the garden and the shady grove. But see Ierne's moors and hideous bogs, Immeasurable tract. The traveller Slow tries his mazy step on th' yielding tuft, Shudd'ring with fear: Ev'n such perfidious wilds, By labour won, have yielded to the comb The fairest length of wool. See Deeping fens, And the long lawns of Bourn. 'Tis Art and Toil Gives Nature value, multiplies her stores, Varies, improves, creates: 'tis Art and Toil Teaches her woody hills with fruits to shine, The pear and tasteful apple: decks with flow'rs And foodful pulse the fields, that often rise, Admiring to behold their furrows wave With yellow corn. What changes cannot Toil, With patient Art, effect? There was a time, When other regions were the swain's delight, And shepherdless Britannia's rushy vales, Inglorious, neither trade nor labour knew, But of rude baskets, homely rustic gear, Wov'n of the flexile willow; till, at length, The plains of Sarum open'd to the hand Of patient culture, and, o'er sinking woods, High Cotswold show'd her summits. Urchinfield, And Lemster's crofts, beneath the pheasant's brake, Long lay unnoted. Toil new pasture gives; And, in the regions oft of active Gaul, O'er lessening vineyards spread the growing turf. In eldest times, when kings and hardy chiefs In bleating sheepfolds met, for purest wool PhÅnicia's hilly tracts were most renown'd, And fertile Syria's and JudÃ¦'s land, Hermon, and Seir, and Hebron's brooky sides; Twice with the murex, crimson hue, they ting'd The shining fleeces: hence their gorgeous wealth; And hence arose the walls of ancient Tyre. Next busy Colchis, bless'd with frequent rains, And lively verdure (who the lucid stream Of Phasis boasted, and a portly race Of fair inhabitants) improv'd the fleece; When, o'er the deep by flying Phryxus brought, The fam'd Thessalian ram enrich'd her plains. This rising Greece with indignation view'd, And youthful Jason an attempt conceiv'd Lofty and bold: along Peneus' banks, Around Olympus' brows, the Muses' haunts, He rous'd the brave to redemand the fleece. Attend, ye British swains, the ancient song. From ev'ry region of Ãgea's shore The brave assembled; those illustrious twins, Castor and Pollux; Orpheus, tuneful bard; Zetes and Calais, as the wind in speed; Strong Hercules; and many a chief renown'd. On deep Iolcos' sandy shore they throng'd, Gleaming in armour, ardent of exploits; And soon, the laurel cord and the huge stone Up-lifting to the deck, unmoor'd the bark; Whose keel, of wondrous length, the skilful hand Of Argus fashion'd for the proud attempt; And in th' extended keel a lofty mast Up-rais'd, and sails full-swelling; to the chiefs Unwonted objects: now, first now they learn'd Their bolder steerage over ocean wave, Led by the golden stars, as Chiron's art Had mark'd the sphere celestial. Wide abroad Expands the purple deep; the cloudy isles, Scyros, and Scopelos, and Icos, rise, And Halonesos: soon huge Lemnos heaves Her azure head above the level brine, Shakes off her mists, and brightens all her cliffs: While they, her flatt'ring creeks and op'ning bow'rs Cautious approaching, in Myrina's port Cast out the cabled stone upon the strand. Next to the Mysian shore they shape their course, But with too eager haste: in the white foam His oar Alcides breaks; howe'er, not long The chance detains; he springs upon the shore, And, rifting from the roots a tap'ring pine, Renews his stroke. Between the threat'ning tow'rs Of Hellespont they ply the rugged surge, To Hero's and Leander's ardent love Fatal: then smooth Propontis' wid'ning wave, That like a glassy lake expands, with hills, Hills above hills, and gloomy woods, begirt. And now the Thracian Bosphorus they dare, Till the Symplegades, tremendous rocks, Threaten approach; but they, unterrified, Through the sharp-pointed cliffs and thund'ring floods Cleave their bold passage: nathless by the crags And torrents sorely shatter'd: as the strong Eagle or vulture, in th' entangling net Involv'd, breaks through, yet leaves his plumes behind. Thus, through the wide waves, their slow way they force To Thynia's hospitable isle. The brave Pass many perils, and to fame by such Experience rise. Refresh'd, again they speed From cape to cape, and view unnumber'd streams, Halys, with hoary Lycus, and the mouths Of Asparus and Glaucus, rolling swift To the broad deep their tributary waves; Till in the long-sought harbour they arrive Of golden Phasis. Foremost on the strand Jason advanc'd: the deep capacious bay, The crumbling terrace of the marble port, Wond'ring he view'd, and stately palace-domes, Pavilions proud of luxury: around, In ev'ry glitt'ring hall, within, without, O'er all the timbrel-sounding squares and streets, Nothing appear'd but luxury, and crowds Sunk in deep riot. To the public weal Attentive none he found: for he, their chief Of shepherds, proud Ãetes, by the name Sometimes of king distinguish'd, 'gan to slight The shepherd's trade, and turn to song and dance: Ev'n Hydrus ceas'd to watch; Medea's songs Of joy, and rosy youth, and beauty's charms, With magic sweetness lull'd his cares asleep, Till the bold heroes grasp'd the golden fleece. Nimbly they wing'd the bark, surrounded soon By Neptune's friendly waves: secure they speed O'er the known seas, by ev'ry guiding cape, With prosperous return. The myrtle shores, And glassy mirror of Iolcos' lake, With loud acclaim receiv'd them. Ev'ry vale, And ev'ry hillock, touch'd the tuneful stops Of pipes unnumber'd, for the ram regain'd. Thus Phasis lost his pride: his slighted nymphs Along the with'ring dales and pastures mourn'd; The trade-ship left his streams; the merchant shunn'd His desert borders: each ingenious Art, Trade, Liberty, and Affluence, all retir'd, And left to Want and Servitude their seats; Vile successors! and gloomy Ignorance Following, like dreary night, whose sable hand Hangs on the purple skirts of flying Day. Sithence the fleeces of Arcadian plains, And Attic, and Thessalian, bore esteem; And those in Grecian colonies dispers'd, Caria and Doris, and IÃ¶nia's coast, And fam'd Tarentum, where Galesus' tide, Rolling by ruins hoar of ancient towns, Through solitary valleys seeks the sea. Or green Altinum, by an hundred Alps High-crown'd, whose woods and snowy peaks aloft Shield her low plains from the rough northern blast. Those, too, of BÅtica's delicious fields, With golden fruitage bless'd of highest taste, What need I name? The Turdetanian tract, Or rich Coraxus, whose wide looms unroll'd The finest webs? where scarce a talent weigh'd A ram's equivalent. Then only tin To late-improv'd Britannia gave renown. Lo, the revolving course of mighty Time, Who loftiness abases, tumbles down Olympus' brow, and lifts the lowly vale. Where is the majesty of ancient Rome, The throng of heroes in her splendid streets, The snowy vest of peace, or purple robe, Slow trail'd triumphal? Where the Attic fleece, And Tarentine, in warmest litter'd cotes, Or sunny meadows, cloth'd with costly care? All in the solitude of ruin lost, War's horrid carnage, vain ambition's dust. Long lay the mournful realms of elder fame In gloomy desolation, till appear'd Beauteous Venetia, first of all the nymphs, Who from the melancholy waste emerg'd: In Adria's gulph her clotted locks she lav'd, And rose another Venus: each soft joy, Each aid of life, her busy wit restor'd; Science reviv'd, with all the lovely arts, And all the graces. Restituted trade To ev'ry virtue lent his helping stores, And clear'd the vales around; again the pipe, And bleating flocks, awak'd the echoing lawns. The glossy fleeces now of prime esteem Soft Asia boasts, where lovely Cassimere, Within a lofty mound of circling hills, Spreads her delicious stores; woods, rocks, caves, lakes, Hills, lawns, and winding streams; a region term'd The paradise of Indus. Next, the plains Of Lahor, by that arbour stretch'd immense, Through many a realm, to Agra, the proud throne Of India's worshipped prince, whose lust is law: Remote dominions; nor to ancient fame Nor modern known, till public-hearted Roe, Faithful, sagacious, active, patient, brave, Led to their distant climes advent'rous Trade. Add too the silky wool of Libyan lands, Of Caza's bow'ry dales, and brooky Caus, Where lofty Atlas spreads his verdant feet, While in the clouds his hoary shoulders bend. Next proud Iberia glories in the growth Of high Castile, and mild Segovian glades. And beauteous Albion, since great Edgar chas'd The prowling wolf, with many a lock appears Of silky lustre; chief, Siluria, thine; Thine, Vaga, favour'd stream; from sheep minute On Cambria bred: a pound o'erweighs a fleece. Gay Epsom's too, and Banstead's, and what gleams On Vecta's isle, that shelters Albion's fleet, With all its thunders: or Salopian stores, Those which are gather'd in the fields of Clun: High Cotswold also 'mong the shepherd swains Is oft remembered, though the greedy plough Preys on its carpet: He, whose rustic Muse O'er heath and craggy holt her wing display'd, And sung the bosky bourns of Alfred's shires, Has favour'd Cotswold with luxuriant praise. Need we the levels green of Lincoln note, Or rich Leicestria's early plains, for length Of whitest locks and magnitude of fleece Peculiar; envy of the neighb'ring realms? But why recount our grassy lawns alone, While ev'n the tillage of our cultur'd plains, With bossy turnip, and luxuriant cole, Learns through the circling year their flocks to feed. Ingenious Trade, to clothe the naked world, Her soft materials, not from sheep alone, From various animals, reeds, trees, and stones, Collects sagacious: in EubÅa's isle A wond'rous rock is found, of which are wov'n Vests incombustible: Batavia, flax; Siam's warm marish yields the fissile cane; Soft Persia, silk; Balasor's shady hills Tough bark of trees; Peruvian Pito, grass; And ev'ry sultry clime the snowy down Of cotton, bursting from its stubborn shell To gleam amid the verdure of the grove. With glossy hair of Tibet's shaggy goat Are light tiaras wov'n, that wreathe the head, And airy float behind: the beaver's flix Gives kindliest warmth to weak enervate limbs, When the pale blood slow rises through the veins. Still shall o'er all prevail the shepherd's stores, For num'rous uses known: none yield such warmth, Such beauteous hues receive, so long endure; So pliant to the loom, so various, none. Wild rove the flocks, no burdening fleece they bear In fervid climes: nature gives nought in vain. Carmenian wool on the broad tail alone Resplendent swells, enormous in its growth: As the sleek ram from green to green removes, On aiding wheels his heavy pride he draws, And glad resigns it for the hatter's use. Ev'n in the new Columbian world appears The woolly covering: Apacheria's glades, And Canses, echo to the pipes and flocks Of foreign swains. While time shakes down his sands, And works continual change, be none secure: Quicken your labours, brace your slack'ning nerves, Ye Britons; nor sleep careless on the lap Of bounteous nature; she is elsewhere kind. See Mississippi lengthen on her lawns, Propitious to the shepherds: see the sheep Of fertile Arica, like camels form'd; Which bear huge burdens to the sea-beat shore, And shine with fleeces soft as feathery down. Coarse Bothnic locks are not devoid of use; They clothe the mountain carl, or mariner Lab'ring at the wet shrouds, or stubborn helm, While the loud billows dash the groaning deck. All may not Stroud's or Taunton's vestures wear: Nor what, from fleece RatÃ¦an, mimic flow'rs Of rich Damascus: many a texture bright Of that material in PrÃ¦torium wov'n, Or in Norvicum, cheats the curious eye. If any wool peculiar to our isle Is giv'n by nature, 'tis the comber's lock, The soft, the snow-white, and the long-grown flake. Hither be turn'd the public's wakeful eye, This golden fleece to guard, with strictest watch, From the dark hand of pilf'ring Avarice, Who, like a spectre, haunts the midnight hour, When Nature wide around him lies supine And silent, in the tangles soft involv'd Of death-like sleep: he then the moment marks, While the pale moon illumes the trembling tide, Speedy to lift the canvas, bend the oar, And waft his thefts to the perfidious foe. Happy the patriot, who can teach the means To check his frauds, and yet untroubled leave Trade's open channels. Would a gen'rous aid To honest toil, in Cambria's hilly tracts, Or where the Lune or Coker wind their streams, Be found sufficient? Far, their airy fields, Far from infectious luxury arise. O might their mazy dales, and mountain sides, With copious fleeces of Ierne shine, And gulphy Caledonia, wisely bent On wealthy fisheries and flaxen webs; Then would the sister realms, amid their seas, Like the three Graces in harmonious fold, By mutual aid enhance their various charms, And bless remotest climesâTo this lov'd end Awake, Benevolence; to this lov'd end, Strain all thy nerves, and ev'ry thought explore. Far, far away, whose passions would immure, In your own little hearts, the joys of life; (Ye worms of pride) for your repast alone, Who claim all Nature's stores, woods, waters, meads, All her profusion; whose vile hands would grasp The peasant's scantling, the weak widow's mite, And in the sepulchre of Self entomb Whate'er ye can, whate'er ye cannot use. Know, for superior ends th' Almighty Power (The Power, whose tender arms embrace the worm) Breathes o'er the foodful earth the breath of life, And forms us manifold; allots to each His fair peculiar; wisdom, wit, and strength; Wisdom, and wit, and strength, in sweet accord, To aid, to cheer, to counsel, to protect, And twist the mighty bond. Thus feeble man, With man united, is a nation strong; Builds tow'ry cities, satiates ev'ry want, And makes the seas profound, and forests wild, The gardens of his joys. Man, each man's born For the high business of the public good. For me, 'tis mine to pray, that men regard Their occupation with an honest heart, And cheerful diligence: like the useful bee, To gather for the hive not sweets alone, But wax, and each material; pleas'd to find Whate'er may soothe distress, and raise the fall'n, In life's rough race: O be it as my wish! 'Tis mine to teach th' inactive hand to reap Kind Nature's bounties, o'er the globe diffus'd. For this I wake the weary hours of rest; With this desire, the merchant I attend; By this impell'd, the shepherd's hut I seek, And, as he tends his flock, his lectures hear Attentive, pleas'd with pure simplicity, And rules divulg'd beneficent to sheep: Or turn the compass o'er the painted chart, To mark the ways of traffic; Volga's stream, Cold Hudson's cloudy straits, warm Afric's cape, Latium's firm roads, the Ptolemean fosse, And China's long canals. These noble works, These high effects of civilizing trade, Employ me, sedulous of public weal: Yet not unmindful of my sacred charge; Thus also mindful, thus devising good, At vacant seasons, oft; when ev'ning mild Purples the valleys, and the shepherd counts His flock, returning to the quiet fold, With dumb complacence: for Religion, this, To give our ev'ry comfort to distress, And follow virtue with an humble mind; This pure religion. Thus, in elder time, The rev'rend Blasius wore his leisure hours, And slumbers, broken oft: Till, fill'd at length With inspiration, after various thought, And trials manifold, his well-known voice Gather'd the poor, and o'er Vulcanian stoves, With tepid lees of oil, and spiky comb, Shew'd how the fleece might stretch to greater length, And cast a glossier whiteness. Wheels went round; Matrons and maids with songs reliev'd their toils; And ev'ry loom receiv'd the softer yarn. What poor, what widow, Blasius, did not bless, Thy teaching hand? thy bosom, like the morn, Op'ning its wealth? What nation did not seek, Of thy new-modell'd wool, the curious webs? Hence the glad cities of the loom his name Honour with yearly festals: through their streets The pomp, with tuneful sounds, and order just, Denoting labour's happy progress moves, Procession slow and solemn: first the rout; Then servient youth, and magisterial eld; Each after each, according to his rank, His sway, and office, in the commonweal; And to the board of smiling Plenty's stores Assemble, where delicious cates and fruits Of ev'ry clime are pil'd; and with free hand, Toil only tastes the feast, by nerveless Ease Unrelish'd. Various mirth and song resound; And oft they interpose improving talk, Divulging each to other knowledge rare, Sparks from experience that sometimes arise Till night weighs down the sense, or morning's dawn Rouses to labour, man to labour born. Then the sleek bright'ning lock, from hand to hand, Renews its circling course: this feels the card; That, in the comb, admires its growing length; This, blanch'd, emerges from the oily wave; And that, the amber tint, or ruby, drinks. For it suffices not, in flow'ry vales, Only to tend the flock, and shear soft wool: Gums must be stor'd of Guinea's arid coast; Mexican woods, and India's bright'ning salts; Fruits, herbage, sulphurs, minerals, to stain The fleece prepar'd, which oil-imbibing earth Of Wooburn blanches, and keen alum-waves Intenerate. With curious eye observe, In what variety the tribe of salts, Gums, ores, and liquors, eye-delighting hues Produce, abstersive or restringent; how Steel casts the sable: how pale pewter, fus'd In fluid spirituous, the scarlet dye: And how each tint is made, or mixt, or chang'd, By mediums colourless: why is the fume Of sulphur kind to white and azure hues, Pernicious else: why no materials yield Singly their colours, those except that shine With topaz, sapphire, and cornelian rays: And why, though Nature's face is cloth'd in green, No green is found to beautify the fleece, But what repeated toil by mixture gives. To find effects, while causes lie conceal'd, Reason uncertain tries: howe'er, kind chance Oft with equivalent discov'ry pays Its wand'ring efforts; thus the German sage, Diligent Drebbel, o'er alchymic fire, Seeking the secret source of gold, receiv'd Of alter'd cochineal the crimson store. Tyrian Melcartus thus (the first who brought Tin's useful ore from Albion's distant isle, And, for unwearied toils and arts, the name Of Hercules acquir'd), when o'er the mouth Of his attendant sheep-dog he beheld The wounded murex strike a purple stain, The purple stain on fleecy woofs he spread, Which lur'd the eye, adorning many a nymph, And drew the pomp of trade to rising Tyre. Our valleys yield not, or but sparing yield, The dyer's gay materials. Only weld, Or root of madder, here, or purple woad, By which our naked ancestors obscur'd Their hardy limbs, inwrought with mystic forms, Like Egypt's obelisks. The pow'rful sun Hot India's zone with gaudy pencil paints, And drops delicious tints o'er hill and dale, Which Trade to us conveys. Not tints alone; Trade to the good physician gives his balms; Gives cheering cordials to th' afflicted heart; Gives, to the wealthy, delicacies high; Gives, to the curious, works of nature rare: And when the priest displays, in just discourse, Him, the all-wise Creator, and declares His presence, pow'r, and goodness, unconfin'd, 'Tis Trade, attentive voyager, who fills His lips with argument. To censure Trade, Or hold her busy people in contempt, Let none presume. The dignity and grace, And weal, of human life, their fountains owe To seeming imperfections, to vain wants, Or real exigencies; passions swift Forerunning reason; strong contrarious bents, The steps of men dispersing wide abroad O'er realms and seas. There, in the solemn scene, Infinite wonders glare before their eyes, Humiliating the mind enlarg'd; for they The clearest sense of Deity receive, Who view the widest prospect of his works, Ranging the globe with Trade thro' various climes: Who see the signatures of boundless love, Nor less the judgments of Almighty Pow'r, That warn the wicked, and the wretch who 'scapes From human justice: who, astonish'd view Etna's loud thunders and tempestuous fires; The dust of Carthage; desert shores of Nile; Or Tyre's abandon'd summit, crown'd of old With stately tow'rs; whose merchants, from their isles, And radiant thrones, assembled in her marts; Whither Arabia, whither Kedar, brought Their shaggy goats, their flocks and bleating lambs; Where rich Damascus pil'd his fleeces white, Prepar'd, and thirsty for the double tint, And flow'ring shuttle. While th' admiring world Crowded her streets; ah! then the hand of Pride Sow'd imperceptible his pois'nous weed, Which crept destructive up her lofty domes, As ivy creeps around the graceful trunk Of some tall oak. Her lofty domes no more, Not ev'n the ruins of her pomp, remain; Not ev'n the dust they sunk in; by the breath Of the Omnipotent, offended, hurl'd Down to the bottom of the stormy deep: Only the solitary rock remains, Her ancient site; a monument to those, Who toil and wealth exchange for sloth and pride.

Proceed, Arcadian Muse, resume the pipe Of Hermes, long disus'd, though sweet the tone, And to the songs of nature's choristers Harmonious. Audience pure be thy delight, Though few: for ev'ry note which virtue wounds, However pleasing to the vulgar herd, To the purg'd ear is discord. Yet too oft Has false dissembling Vice to am'rous airs The reed apply'd, and heedless youth allur'd: Too oft, with bolder sound, inflam'd the rage Of horrid war. Let now the fleecy looms Direct our rural numbers, as of old, When plains and sheepfolds were the Muses' haunts. So thou, the friend of ev'ry virtuous deed And aim, though feeble, shalt these rural lays Approve, O Heathcote, whose benevolence Visits our valleys; where the pasture spreads, And where the bramble; and would justly act True charity, by teaching idle Want And Vice the inclination to do good, Good to themselves, and in themselves to all, Through grateful toil. E'en Nature lives by toil: Beast, bird, air, fire, the heav'ns, and rolling worlds, All live by action: nothing lies at rest, But death and ruin: man is born to care; Fashion'd, improv'd by labour. This of old Wise states, observing, gave that happy law, Which doom'd the rich and needy, ev'ry rank, To manual occupation; and oft call'd Their chieftains from the spade, or furrowing plough, Or bleating sheepfold. Hence utility Through all conditions; hence the joys of health; Hence strength of arm, and clear judicious thought; Hence corn, and wine, and oil, and all in life Delectable. What simple Nature yields (And Nature does her part) are only rude Materials, cumbers on the thorny ground; 'Tis toil that makes them wealth; that makes the fleece, (Yet useless, rising in unshapen heaps) Anon, in curious woofs of beauteous hue, A vesture usefully succinct and warm, Or, trailing in the length of graceful folds, A royal mantle. Come, ye village nymphs, The scatter'd mists reveal the dusky hills; Grey dawn appears; the golden morn ascends, And paints the glitt'ring rocks, and purple woods, And flaming spires; arise, begin your toils; Behold the fleece beneath the spiky comb Drop its long locks, or from the mingling card Spread in soft flakes, and swell the whiten'd floor. Come, village nymphs, ye matrons, and ye maids, Receive the soft material: with light step Whether ye turn around the spacious wheel, Or, patient sitting, that revolve, which forms A narrower circle. On the brittle work Point your quick eye; and let the hand assist To guide and stretch the gently-less'ning thread: Even, unknotted twine will praise your skill. A diff'rent spinning ev'ry diff'rent web Asks from your glowing fingers: some require The more compact, and some the looser wreath; The last for softness, to delight the touch Of chamber'd delicacy; scarce the cirque Need turn-around, or twine the length'ning flake. There are, to speed their labour, who prefer Wheels double-spol'd, which yield to either hand A sev'ral line: and many yet adhere To th' ancient distaff, at the bosom fix'd, Casting the whirling spindle as they walk: At home, or in the sheepfold, or the mart, Alike the work proceeds. This method still Norvicum favours, and the Icenian towns: It yields their airy stuffs an apter thread. This was of old, in no inglorious days, The mode of spinning, when th' Egyptian prince A golden distaff gave that beauteous nymph, Too beauteous Helen: no uncourtly gift Then, when each gay diversion of the fair Led to ingenious use. But patient art, That on experience works, from hour to hour, Sagacious, has a spiral engine form'd, Which, on a hundred spoles, a hundred threads, With one huge wheel, by lapse of water, twines, Few hands requiring; easy-tended work, That copiously supplies the greedy loom. Nor hence, ye nymphs, let anger cloud your brows; The more is wrought, the more is still requir'd: Blithe o'er your toils, with wonted song, proceed: Fear not surcharge; your hands will ever find Ample employment. In the strife of trade, These curious instruments of speed obtain Various advantage, and the diligent Supply with exercise, as fountains sure, Which, ever-gliding, feed the flow'ry lawn. Nor, should the careful State, severely kind, In ev'ry province, to the house of toil Compel the vagrant, and each implement Of ruder art, the comb, the card, the wheel, Teach their unwilling hands, nor yet complain. Yours, with the public good, shall ever rise, Ever, while o'er the lawns, and airy downs The bleating sheep and shepherd's pipe are heard; While in the brook ye blanch the glist'ning fleece, And th' am'rous youth, delighted with your toils, Quavers the choicest of his sonnets, warm'd By growing traffic, friend to wedded love. The am'rous youth with various hopes inflam'd, Now on the busy stage see him step forth, With beating breast: high-honour'd he beholds Rich industry. First, he bespeaks a loom: From some thick wood the carpenter selects A slender oak, or beech of glossy trunk, Or saplin ash: he shapes the sturdy beam, The posts, and treadles; and the frame combines. The smith, with iron screws, and plated hoops, Confirms the strong machine, and gives the bolt That strains the roll. To these the turner's lathe And graver's knife, the hollow shuttle add. Various professions in the work unite: For each on each depends. Thus he acquires The curious engine, work of subtle skill; Howe'er in vulgar use around the globe Frequent observ'd, of high antiquity No doubtful mark: th' advent'rous voyager, Toss'd over ocean to remotest shores, Hears on remotest shores the murm'ring loom; Sees the deep-furrowing plough, and harrow'd field, The wheel-mov'd waggon, and the discipline Of strong-yok'd steers. What needful art is new? Next, the industrious youth employs his care To store soft yarn; and now he strains the warp Along the garden-walk, or highway side, Smoothing each thread; now fits it to the loom, And sits before the work: from hand to hand The thready shuttle glides along the lines, Which open to the woof, and shut altern: And ever and anon, to firm the work, Against the web is driv'n the noisy frame, That o'er the level rushes, like a surge, Which, often dashing on the sandy beach, Compacts the trav'ller's road: from hand to hand Again, across the lines oft op'ning, glides The thready shuttle, while the web apace Increases, as the light of eastern skies Spread by the rosy fingers of the morn; And all the fair expanse with beauty glows. Or if the broader mantle be the task, He chooses some companion to his toil. From side to side, with amicable aim, Each to the other darts the nimble bolt, While friendly converse, prompted by the work, Kindles improvement in the op'ning mind. What need we name the sev'ral kinds of looms? Those delicate, to whose fair-colour'd threads Hang figur'd weights, whose various numbers guide The artist's hand: he, unseen flow'rs, and trees, And vales, and azure hills, unerring works. Or that, whose num'rous needles, glitt'ring bright, Weave the warm hose to cover tender limbs: Modern invention: modern is the want. Next, from the slacken'd beam the woof unroll'd, Near some clear-sliding river, Aire or Stroud, Is by the noisy fulling-mill receiv'd; Where tumbling waters turn enormous wheels, And hammers, rising and descending, learn To imitate the industry of man. Oft the wet web is steep'd, and often rais'd, Fast-dripping, to the river's grassy bank; And sinewy arms of men, with full-strain'd strength, Wring out the latent water; then, up-hung On rugged tenters, to the fervid sun Its level surface, reeking, it expands; Still bright'ning in each rigid discipline, And gath'ring worth; as human life, in pains, Conflicts, and troubles. Soon the clothier's shears And burler's thistle skim the surface sheen. The round of work goes on, from day to day, Season to season. So the husbandman Pursues his cares; his plough divides the glebe; The seed is sown; rough rattle o'er the clods The harrow's teeth; quick weeds his hoe subdues; The sickle labours, and the slow team strains; Till grateful harvest-home rewards his toils. Th' ingenious artist, learn'd in drugs, bestows The last improvement; for th' unlabour'd fleece Rare is permitted to imbibe the dye. In penetrating waves of boiling vats The snowy web is steep'd, with grain of weld, Fustic, or logwood mix'd, or cochineal, Or the dark purple pulp of Pictish woad, Of stain tenacious, deep as summer skies, Like those that canopy the bow'rs of Stow After soft rains, when birds their notes attune, Ere the melodious nightingale begins. From yon broad vase behold the saffron woofs Beauteous emerge; from these the azure rise; This glows with crimson; that the auburn holds; These shall the prince with purple robes adorn; And those the warrior mark, and those the priest. Few are the primal colours of the art; Five only; black, and yellow, blue, brown, red; Yet hence innumerable hues arise. That stain alone is good which bears unchang'd Dissolving water's, and calcining sun's, And thieving air's attacks. How great the need, With utmost caution to prepare the woof, To seek the best-adapted dyes, and salts, And purest gums! since your whole skill consists In op'ning well the fibres of the woof, For the reception of the beauteous dye, And wedging ev'ry grain in ev'ry pore, Firm as a diamond in rich gold enchas'd. But what the pow'rs, which lock them in the web; Whether incrusting salts, or weight of air, Or fountain-water's cold contracting wave, Or all combin'd, it well befits to know. Ah! wherefore have we lost our old repute? And who inquires the cause, why Gallia's sons In depth and brilliancy of hues excel? Yet yield not, Britons; grasp in ev'ry art The foremost name. Let others tamely view, On crowded Smyrna's and Byzantium's strand, The haughty Turk despise their proffer'd bales. Now see, o'er vales, and peopled mountain-tops, The welcome traders gath'ring ev'ry web Industrious, ev'ry web too few. Alas! Successless oft their industry, when cease The loom and shuttle in the troubled streets; Their motion stopt by wild Intemperance, Toil's scoffing foe, who lures the giddy rout To scorn their task-work, and to vagrant life Turns their rude steps; while Misery, among The cries of infants, haunts their mould'ring huts. O when, through ev'ry province, shall be rais'd Houses of labour, seats of kind constraint, For those who now delight in fruitless sports, More than in cheerful works of virtuous trade, Which honest wealth would yield, and portion due Of public welfare? Ho, ye poor! who seek, Among the dwellings of the diligent, For sustenance unearn'd; who stroll abroad From house to house, with mischievous intent, Feigning misfortune: Ho, ye lame! ye blind! Ye languid limbs, with real want oppress'd, Who tread the rough highways, and mountains wild, Through storms, and rains, and bitterness of heart; Ye children of Affliction! be compell'd To happiness: the long-wish'd daylight dawns, When charitable rigour shall detain Your step-bruis'd feet. Ev'n now the sons of Trade, Where'er their cultivated hamlets smile, Erect the mansion: here soft fleeces shine; The card awaits you, and the comb, and wheel: Here shroud you from the thunder of the storm; No rain shall wet your pillow: here abounds Pure bev'rage; here your viands are prepar'd; To heal each sickness the physician waits, And priest entreats to give your Maker praise. Behold, in Calder's vale, where wide around Unnumber'd villas creep the shrubby hills, A spacious dome for this fair purpose rise. High o'er the open gates, with gracious air, Eliza's image stands. By gentle steps Up-rais'd, from room to room we slowly walk, And view with wonder, and with silent joy, The sprightly scene; where many a busy hand, Where spoles, cards, wheels, and looms, with motion quick, And ever-murm'ring sound, th' unwonted sense Wrap in surprise. To see them all employ'd, All blithe, it gives the spreading heart delight, As neither meats, nor drinks, nor aught of joy Corporeal, can bestow. Nor less they gain Virtue than wealth, while, on their useful works From day to day intent, in their full minds Evil no place can find. With equal scale Some deal abroad the well-assorted fleece; These card the short, those comb the longer flake; Others the harsh and clotted lock receive, Yet sever and refine with patient toil, And bring to proper use. Flax too, and hemp, Excite their diligence. The younger hands Ply at the easy work of winding yarn On swiftly-circling engines, and their notes Warble together, as a choir of larks: Such joy arises in the mind employ'd. Another scene displays the more robust, Rasping or grinding tough Brasilian woods, And what Campeachy's disputable shore Copious affords to tinge the thirsty web; And the Caribbee isles, whose dulcet canes Equal the honey-comb. We next are shown A circular machine, of new design, In conic shape: it draws and spins a thread Without the tedious toil of needless hands. A wheel, invisible, beneath the floor, To ev'ry member of th' harmonious frame Gives necessary motion. One, intent, O'erlooks the work: the carded wool, he says, Is smoothly lapp'd around those cylinders, Which, gently turning, yield it to yon cirque Of upright spindles, which, with rapid whirl, Spin out, in long extent, an even twine. From this delightful mansion (if we seek Still more to view the gifts which honest toil Distributes) take we now our eastward course, To the rich fields of Burstal. Wide around Hillock and valley, farm and village, smile: And ruddy roofs, and chimney-tops appear, Of busy Leeds, up-wafting to the clouds The incense of thanksgiving: all is joy; And trade and business guide the living scene, Roll the full cars, adown the winding Aire Load the slow-sailing barges, pile the pack On the long tinkling train of slow-pac'd steeds. As when a sunny day invites abroad The sedulous ants, they issue from their cells In bands unnumber'd, eager for their work; O'er high, o'er low, they lift, they draw, they haste With warm affection to each other's aid; Repeat their virtuous efforts, and succeed. Thus all is here in motion, all is life: The creaking wain brings copious store of corn: The grazier's sleeky kine obstruct the roads: The neat dress'd housewives, for the festal board Crown'd with full baskets, in the field-way paths Come tripping on; th' echoing hills repeat The stroke of axe and hammer; scaffolds rise, And growing edifices; heaps of stone, Beneath the chisel, beauteous shapes assume Of frieze and column. Some, with even line, New streets are making in the neighb'ring fields, And sacred domes of worship. Industry, Which dignifies the artist, lifts the swain, And the straw cottage to a palace turns, Over the work presides. Such was the scene Of hurrying Carthage, when the Trojan chief First view'd her growing turrets. So appear Th' increasing walls of busy Manchester, Sheffield, and Birmingham, whose redd'ning fields Rise and enlarge their suburbs. Lo! in throngs, For ev'ry realm, the careful factors meet, Whisp'ring each other. In long ranks the bales, Like war's bright files, beyond the sight extend. Straight, ere the sounding bell the signal strikes Which ends the hour of traffic, they conclude The speedy compact; and, well-pleas'd, transfer, With mutual benefit, superior wealth To many a kingdom's rent, or tyrant's hoard. Whate'er is excellent in art proceeds From labour and endurance: deep the oak Must sink in stubborn earth its roots obscure, That hopes to lift its branches to the skies: Gold cannot gold appear, until man's toil Discloses wide the mountain's hidden ribs, And digs the dusky ore, and breaks and grinds Its gritty parts, and laves in limpid streams, With oft-repeated toil, and oft in fire The metal purifies: with the fatigue, And tedious process of its painful works, The lusty sicken, and the feeble die. But cheerful are the labours of the loom, By health and ease accompany'd: they bring Superior treasures speedier to the state Than those of deep Peruvian mines, where slaves (Wretched requital) drink, with trembling hand, Pale palsy's baneful cup. Our happy swains Behold arising, in their fatt'ning flocks, A double wealth; more rich than Belgium's boast, Who tends the culture of the flaxen reed; Or the Cathayan's, whose ignobler care Nurses the silk-worm; or of India's sons, Who plant the cotton-grove by Ganges' stream. Nor do their toils and products furnish more Than gauds and dresses, of fantastic web, To the luxurious: but our kinder toils Give clothing to necessity; keep warm Th' unhappy wand'rer, on the mountain wild Benighted, while the tempest beats around. No, ye soft sons of Ganges, and of Ind, Ye feebly delicate, life little needs Your fem'nine toys, nor asks your nerveless arm To cast the strong-flung shuttle, or the spear. Can ye defend your country from the storm Of strong Invasion? Can ye want endure, In the besieged fort, with courage firm? Can ye the weather-beaten vessel steer, Climb the tall mast, direct the stubborn helm, 'Mid wild discordant waves, with steady course? Can ye lead out, to distant colonies, Th' o'erflowings of a people, or your wrong'd Brethren, by impious persecution driv'n, And arm their breasts with fortitude to try New regions; climes, though barren, yet beyond The baneful pow'r of tyrants? These are deeds To which their hardy labours well prepare The sinewy arm of Albion's sons. Pursue, Ye sons of Albion, with unyielding heart, Your hardy labours: let the sounding loom Mix with the melody of ev'ry vale; The loom, that long-renown'd, wide-envy'd gift Of wealthy Flandria, who the boon receiv'd From fair Venetia; she from Grecian nymphs; They from Phenice, who obtain'd the dole From old Ãgyptus. Thus, around the globe The golden-footed Sciences their path Mark, like the sun, enkindling life and joy; And, followed close by Ignorance and Pride, Lead day and night o'er realms. Our day arose When Alva's tyranny the weaving arts Drove from the fertile valleys of the Scheld, With speedy wing, and scatter'd course they fled, Like a community of bees, disturb'd By some relentless swain's rapacious hand; While good Eliza, to the fugitives Gave gracious welcome; as wise Egypt erst To troubled Nilus, whose nutritious flood With annual gratitude enrich'd her meads. Then, from fair Antwerp, an industrious train Cross'd the smooth channel of our smiling seas; And in the vales of Cantium, on the banks Of Stour alighted, and the naval wave Of spacious Medway: some on gentle Yare, And fertile Waveney, pitch'd; and made their seats Pleasant Norvicum, and Colcestria's towers: Some to the Darent sped their happy way: Berghem, and Sluys, and elder Bruges, chose Antona's chalky plains, and stretch'd their tents Down to Clausentum, and that bay supine Beneath the shade of Vecta's cliffy isle. Soon o'er the hospitable realm they spread, With cheer reviv'd; and in Sabrina's flood, And the Silurian Tame, their textures blanch'd: Not undelighted with Vigornia's spires, Nor those, by Vaga's stream, from ruins rais'd Of ancient Ariconium; nor less pleas'd With Salop's various scenes; and that soft tract Of Cambria, deep-embay'd, Dimetian land, By green hills fenc'd, by ocean's murmur lull'd; Nurse of the rustic bard, who now resounds The fortunes of the fleece; whose ancestors Were fugitives from superstition's rage, And erst from Devon thither brought the loom; Where ivy'd walls of old Kidwelly's tow'rs, Nodding, still on their gloomy brows project Lancastria's arms, emboss'd in mould'ring stone. Thus, then, on Albion's coast, the exil'd band. From rich Menapian towns, and the green banks Of Scheld, alighted; and, alighting, sang Grateful thanksgiving. Yet, at times, they shift Their habitations, when the hand of pride, Restraint, or southern luxury, disturbs Their industry, and urges them to vales Of the Brigantes; where, with happier care Inspirited, their art improves the fleece, Which occupation erst, and wealth immense, Gave Brabant's swarming habitants, what time We were their shepherds only; from which state With friendly arm they rais'd us: nathless some Among our old and stubborn swains misdeem'd, And envy'd, who enrich'd them; envy'd those, Whose virtues taught the varletry of towns To useful toil to turn the pilf'ring hand. And still, when bigotry's black clouds arise (For oft they sudden rise in papal realms), They from their isle, as from some ark secure, Careless, unpitying, view the fiery bolts Of superstition, and tyrannic rage, And all the fury of the rolling storm, Which fierce pursues the suff'rers in their flight. Shall not our gates, shall not Britannia's arms Spread ever open to receive their flight? A virtuous people, by distresses oft (Distresses for the sake of truth endur'd) Corrected, dignify'd; creating good Wherever they inhabit: this our isle Has oft experienc'd; witness all ye realms Of either hemisphere, where commerce flows: Th' important truth is stampt on every bale; Each glossy cloth, and drape of mantle warm, Receives th' impression; ev'ry airy woof, Cheyney, and baize, and serge, and alepine, Tammy, and crape, and the long countless list Of woollen webs; and ev'ry work of steel; And that crystalline metal, blown or fus'd, Limpid as water dropping from the clefts Of mossy marble: not to name the aids Their wit has giv'n the fleece, now taught to link With flax, or cotton, or the silk-worm's thread, And gain the graces of variety: Whether to form the matron's decent robe, Or the thin-shading trail for Agra's nymphs; Or solemn curtains, whose long gloomy folds Surround the soft pavilions of the rich. They too the many-colour'd Arras taught To mimic nature, and the airy shapes Of sportive fancy: such as oft appear In old mosaic pavements, when the plough Up-turns the crumbling glebe of Weldon field; Or that, o'ershaded erst by Woodstock's bow'r, Now grac'd by Blenheim in whose stately rooms Rise glowing tapestries, that lure the eye With Marlb'ro's wars: here Schellenberg exults, Behind surrounding hills of ramparts steep, And vales of trenches dark; each hideous pass Armies defend; yet on the hero leads His Britons, like a torrent, o'er the mounds. Another scene is Blenheim's glorious field, And the red Danube. Here, the rescu'd states Crowding beneath his shield; there, Ramillies' Important battle: next, the tenfold chain Of Arleux burst, and th' adamantine gates Of Gaul flung open to the tyrant's throne. A shade obscures the restâAh, then what pow'r Invidious from the lifted sickle snatch'd The harvest of the plain? So lively glows The fair delusion, that our passions rise In the beholding, and the glories share Of visionary battle. This bright art Did zealous Europe learn of pagan hands, While she assay'd with rage of holy war To desolate their fields: but old the skill: Long were the Phrygians' pict'ring looms renown'd; Tyre also, wealthy seat of arts, excell'd, And elder Sidon, in th' historic web. Far distant Tibet in her gloomy woods Rears the gay tent, of blended wool unwov'n, And glutinous materials: the Chinese Their porcelain, Japan its varnish boasts. Some fair peculiar graces ev'ry realm, And each from each a share of wealth acquires. But chief by numbers of industrious hands A nation's wealth is counted: numbers raise Warm emulation: where that virtue dwells, There will be traffic's seat; there will she build Her rich emporium. Hence, ye happy swains! With hospitality inflame your breast, And emulation: the whole world receive, And with their arts, their virtues deck your isle. Each clime, each sea, the spacious orb of each, Shall join their various stores, and amply feed The mighty brotherhood; while ye proceed, Active and enterprising, or to teach The stream a naval course, or till the wild, Or drain the fen, or stretch the long canal, Or plough the fertile billows of the deep. Why to the narrow circle of our coast Should we submit our limits, while each wind Assists the stream and sail, and the wide main Woos us in ev'ry port? See Belgium build, Upon the foodful brine her envy'd power; And, half her people floating on the wave, Expand her fishy regions. Thus our isle, Thus only may Britannia be enlarg'd.â But whither, by the visions of the theme Smit with sublime delight, but whither strays The raptur'd Muse, forgetful of her task? No common pleasure warms the gen'rous mind, When it beholds the labours of the loom; How widely round the globe they are dispers'd, From little tenements by wood or croft, Through many a slender path, how sedulous, As rills to rivers broad, they speed their way To public roads, to Fosse, or Watling-street, Or Armine, ancient works; and thence explore, Through ev'ry navigable wave, the sea, That laps the green earth round: through Tyne, and Tees, Through Weare, and Lune, and merchandizing Hull, And Swale, and Aire, whose crystal waves reflect The various colours of the tinctur'd web: Through Ken, swift rolling down his rocky dale, Like giddy youth impetuous, then at Wick Curbing his train, and, with the sober pace Of cautious eld, meand'ring to the deep; Through Dart and sullen Exe, whose murm'ring wave Envies the Dune and Rother, who have won The serge and kersie to their blanching streams; Through Towy, winding under Merlin's tow'rs, And Usk that, frequent among hoary rocks, On her deep waters paints th' impending scene, Wild torrents, crags, and woods, and mountain snows. The northern Cambrians, an industrious tribe, Carry their labour on pigmean steeds, Of size exceeding not Leicestrian sheep, Yet strong and sprightly: over hill and dale They travel unfatigued, and lay their bales In Salop's streets, beneath whose lofty walls Pearly Sabrina waits them with her barks, And spreads the swelling sheet. For no-where far From some transparent river's naval course Arise, and fall, our various hills and vales, No-where far distant from the masted wharf. We need not vex the strong laborious hand With toil enormous, as th' Egyptian king, Who join'd the sable waters of the Nile From Memphis' tow'rs, to th' ErythrÃ¦an gulph: Or as the monarch of enfeebled Gaul, Whose will imperious forc'd an hundred streams, Through many a forest, many a spacious wild, To stretch their scanty trains from sea to sea, That some unprofitable skiff might float Across irriguous dales, and hollow'd rocks. Far easier pains may swell our gentler floods, And through the centre of the isle conduct To naval union. Trent and Severn's wave, By plains alone disparted, woo to join Majestic Thamis. With their silver urns The nimble-footed Naiads of the springs A wait, upon the dewy lawn, to speed And celebrate the union; and the light Wood-nymphs, and those who o'er the grots preside, Whose stores bituminous, with sparkling fires, In summer's tedious absence cheer the swains, Long sitting at the loom; and those besides, Who crown with yellow sheaves the farmer's hopes; And all the genii of commercial toil: These on the dewy lawns await, to speed And celebrate the union, that the fleece, And glossy web, to ev'ry port around May lightly glide along. Ev'n now behold, Adown a thousand floods the burden'd barks, With white sails glistening, through the gloomy woods Haste to their harbours. See the silver maze Of stately Thamis, ever chequer'd o'er With deeply-laden barges, gliding smooth And constant as his stream: in growing pomp, By Neptune still attended, slow he rolls To great Augusta's mart, where lofty Trade, Amid a thousand golden spires enthron'd, Gives audience to the world: the strand around Close swarms with busy crowds of many a realm. What bales, what wealth, what industry, what fleets! Lo, from the simple fleece how much proceeds. BOOK IV. THE ARGUMENT.

Now, with our woolly treasures amply stor'd, Glide the tall fleets into the wid'ning main, A floating forest: ev'ry sail, unfurl'd, Swells to the wind, and gilds the azure sky. Meantime, in pleasing care, the pilot steers Steady; with eye intent upon the steel, Steady before the breeze the pilot steers: While gaily o'er the waves the mounting prows Dance, like a shoal of dolphins, and begin To streak with various paths the hoary deep. Batavia's shallow sounds by some are sought, Or sandy Elb, or Weser, who receive The swain's and peasant's toil with grateful hand, Which copious gives return; while some explore Deep Finnic gulfs, and a new shore and mart, The bold creation of that Kesar's pow'r, Illustrious Peter, whose magnific toils Repair the distant Caspian, and restore To trade its ancient ports. Soon Thanet's strand, And Dover's chalky cliff, behind them turn. Soon sinks away the green and level beach Of Romney marish and Rye's silent port, By angry Neptune clos'd, and Vecta's isle, Like the pale moon in vapour, faintly bright. An hundred opening marts are seen, are lost; Devonia's hills retire, and Edgecombe mount, Waving its gloomy groves, delicious scene. Yet steady o'er the waves they steer: and now The fluctuating world of waters wide, In boundless magnitude, around them swells; O'er whose imaginary brim, nor towns, Nor woods, nor mountain tops, nor aught appears, But PhÅbus' orb, refulgent lamp of light, Millions of leagues aloft: heav'n's azure vault Bends overhead, majestic, to its base, Uninterrupted clear circumference; Till, rising o'er the flick'ring waves, the cape Of Finisterre, a cloudy spot, appears. Again, and oft, th' advent'rous sails disperse; These to Iberia, others to the coast Of Lusitania, th' ancient Tharsis deem'd Of Solomon; fair regions, with the webs Of Norwich pleas'd, or those of Manchester; Light airy clothing for their vacant swains, And visionary monks. We, in return Receive Cantabrian steel, and fleeces soft, Segovian or Castilian, far renown'd; And gold's attractive metal, pledge of wealth, Spur of activity, to good or ill Pow'rful incentive; or Hesperian fruits, Fruits of spontaneous growth, the citron bright, The fig, and orange, and heart-cheering wine. Those ships, from ocean broad, which voyage through The gates of Hercules, find many seas, And bays unnumber'd, op'ning to their keels; But shores inhospitable oft to fraud And rapine turn'd, or dreary tracts become Of desolation. The proud Roman coasts, Fall'n, like the Punic, to the dashing waves Resign their ruins: Tiber's boasted flood, Whose pompous moles o'erlook'd the subject deep, Now creeps along, through brakes and yellow dust, While Neptune scarce perceives its murm'ring rill: Such are th' effects, when Virtue slacks her hand; Wild Nature back returns. Along these shores Neglected Trade with difficulty toils, Collecting slender stores, the sun-dried grape, Or capers from the rock, that prompt the taste Of luxury. Ev'n Egypt's fertile strand, Bereft of human discipline, has lost Its ancient lustre: Alexandria's port, Once the metropolis of trade, as Tyre, And elder Sidon, as the Attic town, Beautiful Athens, as rich Corinth, Rhodes, Unhonour'd droops. Of all the num'rous marts, That in those glitt'ring seas with splendour rose, Only Byzantium, of peculiar site, Remains in prosp'rous state; and Tripolis, And Smyrna, sacred ever to the Muse. To these resort the delegates of trade, Social in life, a virtuous brotherhood; And bales of softest wool from Bradford looms, Or Stroud, dispense; yet see, with vain regret, Their stores, once highly priz'd, no longer now, Or sought, or valued: copious webs arrive, Smooth-wov'n of other than Britannia's fleece, On the throng'd strand alluring; the great skill Of Gaul, and greater industry, prevails; That proud imperious foe. Yet ahâ'tis notâ Wrong not the Gaul; it is the foe within Impairs our ancient marts: it is the bribe; 'Tis he who pours into the shops of trade That impious poison: it is he who gains The sacred seat of parliament by means, That vitiate and emasculate the mind; By sloth, by lewd intemp'rance, and a scene Of riot, worse than that which ruin'd Rome. This, this the Tartar, and remote Chinese, And all the brotherhood of life, bewail. Meantime (while those, who dare be just, oppose The various pow'rs of many-headed vice), Ye delegates of trade, by patience rise O'er difficulties; in this sultry clime Note what is found of use: the flix of goat, Red-wool, and balm, and coffee's berry brown, Or dropping gum, or opium's lenient drug; Unnumber'd arts await them: trifles oft, By skilful labour, rise to high esteem. Nor what the peasant, near some lucid wave, Pactolus, SimoÃ¯s, or Meander slow, Renown'd in story, with his plough upturns, Neglect; the hoary medal, and the vase, Statue, and bust, of old magnificence Beautiful relics: oh, could modern time Restore the mimic art, and the clear mien Of patriot sages, Walsinghams, and Yorkes, And Cecils, in long-lasting stone preserve! But mimic art and nature are impair'dâ Impair'd they seemâor in a varied dress Delude our eyes; the world in change delights; Change then your searches, with the varied modes And wants of realms. Sabean frankincense Rare is collected now: few altars smoke Now in the idol fane: Panchaia views Trade's busy fleets regardless pass her coast: Nor frequent are the freights of snow-white woofs, Since Rome, no more the mistress of the world. Varies her garb, and treads her darken'd streets With gloomy cowl, majestical no more. See the dark spirit of tyrannic power. The Thracian channel, long the road of trade To the deep Euxine and its naval streams, And the MÃ¦otis, now is barr'd with chains, And forts of hostile battlement. In aught That joys mankind the arbitrary Turk Delights not: insolent of rule, he spreads Thraldom and desolation o'er his realms. Another path to Scythia's wide domains Commerce discovers: the Livonian gulph Receives her sails, and leads them to the port Of rising Petersburgh, whose splendid streets Swell with the webs of Leeds: the Cossack there, The Calmuc, and Mungolian, round the bales In crowds resort, and their warm'd limbs enfold, Delighted; and the hardy Samoid, Rough with the stings of frost, from his dark caves Ascends, and thither hastes, ere winter's rage O'ertake his homeward step; and they that dwell Along the banks of Don's and Volga's streams, And borderers of the Caspian, who renew That ancient path to India's climes, which fill'd With proudest affluence the Colchian state. Many have been the ways to those renown'd Luxuriant climes of Indus, early known To Memphis; to the port of wealthy Tyre; To Tadmor, beauty of the wilderness, Who down the long Euphrates sent her sails; And sacred Salem, when her num'rous fleets, From Ezion-geber, pass'd th' Arabian gulph. But later times, more fortunate, have found O'er ocean's open wave a surer course, Sailing the western coast of Afric's realms, Of Mauritania, and Nigritian tracts, And islands of the Gorgades, the bounds, On the Atlantic brine, of ancient trade; But not of modern, by the virtue led Of Gama and Columbus. The whole globe Is now, of commerce, made the scene immense; Which daring ships frequent, associated, Like doves, or swallows, in th' ethereal flood, Or, like the eagle, solitary seen. Some, with more open course, to Indus steer: Some coast from port to port, with various men And manners conversant; of th' angry surge, That thunders loud, and spreads the cliffs with foam, Regardless, or the monsters of the deep, Porpoise, or grampus, or the rav'nous shark, That chase their keels; or threat'ning rock, o'erhead, Of Atlas old; beneath the threat'ning rocks, Reckless, they furl their sails, and, bart'ring, take Soft flakes of wool; for in soft flakes of wool, Like the Silurian, Atlas' dales abound. The shores of Sus inhospitable rise, And high Bojador; Zara too displays Unfruitful deserts; Gambia's wave inisles An oozy coast, and pestilential ills Diffuses wide; behind are burning sands, Adverse to life, and Nilus' hidden fount. On Guinea's sultry strand, the drap'ry light Of Manchester or Norwich is bestow'd For clear transparent gums, and ductile wax, And snow-white iv'ry; yet the valued trade, Along this barb'rous coast, in telling, wounds The gen'rous heart, the sale of wretched slaves; Slaves by their tribes condemn'd, exchanging death For life-long servitude; severe exchange! These till our fertile colonies, which yield The sugar-cane, and the Tobago-leaf, And various new productions, that invite Increasing navies to their crowded wharfs. But let the man, whose rough tempestuous hours In this advent'rous traffic are involv'd, With just humanity of heart pursue The gainful commerce: wickedness is blind: Their sable chieftains may in future times Burst their frail bonds, and vengeance execute On cruel unrelenting pride of heart And av'rice. There are ills to come for crimes. Hot Guinea too gives yellow dust of gold, Which, with her rivers, rolls adown the sides Of unknown hills, where fiery-winged winds, And sandy deserts rous'd by sudden storms, All search forbid: howe'er, on either hand Valleys and pleasant plains, and many a tract Deem'd uninhabitable erst, are found Fertile and populous: their sable tribes, In shade of verdant groves, and mountains tall, Frequent enjoy the cool descent of rain, And soft refreshing breezes: nor are lakes Here wanting; those a sea-wide surface spread, Which to the distant Nile and Senegal Send long meanders: whate'er lies beyond, Of rich or barren, ignorance o'ercasts With her dark mantle. Mon'motapa's coast Is seldom visited; and the rough shore Of Cafres, land of savage Hottentots, Whose hands unnatural hasten to the grave Their aged parents; what barbarity And brutal ignorance, where social trade Is held contemptible! Ye gliding sails, From these inhospitable gloomy shores Indignant turn, and to the friendly Cape, Which gives the cheerful mariner good hope Of prosp'rous voyage, steer: rejoice to view, What trade, with Belgian industry, creates, Prospects of civil life, fair towns, and lawns, And yellow tilth, and groves of various fruits, Delectable in husk or glossy rind: There the capacious vase from crystal springs Replenish, and convenient store provide, Like ants, intelligent of future need. See, through the fragrance of delicious airs, That breathe the smell of balms, how traffic shapes A winding voyage, by the lofty coast Of Sofala, thought Ophir; in whose hills Ev'n yet some portion of its ancient wealth Remains, and sparkles in the yellow sand Of its clear streams, though unregarded now; Ophirs more rich are found. With easy course The vessels glide! unless their speed be stopp'd By dead calms, that oft lie on those smooth seas While ev'ry zephyr sleeps: then the shrouds drop; The downy feather, on the cordage hung, Moves not; the flat sea shines like yellow gold, Fus'd in the fire; or like the marble floor Of some old temple wide. But where so wide, In old or later time, its marble floor Did ever temple boast as this, which here Spreads its bright level many a league around? At solemn distances its pillars rise, Sofal's blue rocks, Mozambic's palmy steeps, And lofty Madagascar's glittering shores, Where various woods of beauteous vein and hue, And glossy shells in elegance of form, For Pond's rich cabinet, or Sloan's, are found. Such calm oft checks their course, 'till this bright scene Is brush'd away before the rising breeze, That joys the busy crew, and speeds again The sail full-swelling to Socotra's isle, For aloes fam'd; or to the wealthy marts Of Ormus or Gombroon, whose streets are oft With caravans and tawny merchants throng'd, From neighb'ring provinces and realms afar; And fill'd with plenty, though dry sandy wastes Spread naked round; so great the pow'r of trade. Persia few ports; more happy Indostan Beholds Surat and Goa on her coasts, And Bombay's wealthy isle, and harbour fam'd, Supine beneath the shade of cocoa groves. But what avails, or many ports or few? Where wild Ambition frequent from his lair Starts up; while fell revenge and famine lead To havoc, reckless of the tyrant's whip, Which clanks along the vallies: oft in vain The merchant seeks upon the strand whom erst, Associated by trade, he deck'd and cloth'd; In vain, whom rage or famine has devour'd, He seeks; and with increas'd affection thinks On Britain. Still howe'er Bombaya's wharfs Pile up blue indigo, and, of frequent use, Pungent saltpetre, woods of purple grain, And many-colour'd saps from leaf and flow'r, And various gums; the clothier knows their worth; And wool resembling cotton, shorn from trees, Not to the fleece unfriendly; whether mixt In warp or woof, or with the line of flax, Or softer silk's material: though its aid To vulgar eyes appears not; let none deem The fleece in any traffic unconcern'd; By ev'ry traffic aided; while each work Of art yields wealth to exercise the loom, And ev'ry loom employs each hand of art. Nor is there wheel in the machine of trade, Which Leeds, or Cairo, Lima, or Bombay, Helps not, with harmony, to turn around, Though all unconscious of the union act. Few the peculiars of Canara's realm, Or sultry Malabar; where it behoves The wary pilot, while he coasts their shores, To mark o'er ocean the thick rising isles; Woody Chaetta, Birter rough with rocks; Green-rising Barmur, Mincoy's purple hills; And the minute Maldivias, as a swarm Of bees in summer on a poplar's trunk, Clust'ring innumerable; these behind His stern receding, o'er the clouds he views Ceylon's grey peaks, from whose volcanos rise Dark smoke and ruddy flame, and glaring rocks Darted in air aloft; around whose feet Blue cliffs ascend, and aromatic groves, In various prospect; Ceylon also deem'd The ancient Ophir. Next Bengala's bay, On the vast globe the deepest, while the prow Turns northward to the rich disputed strand Of Cormandel, where Traffic grieves to see Discord and Avarice invade her realms, Portending ruinous war, and cries aloud, âPeace, peace, ye blinded Britons, and ye Gauls; Nation to nation is a light, a fire Enkindling virtue, sciences, and arts:â But cries aloud in vain. Yet wise defence, Against Ambition's wide-destroying pride, Madras erected, and Saint David's Fort, And those which rise on Ganges' twenty streams, Guarding the woven fleece, Calcutta's tow'r, And Maldo's and Patana's: from their holds The shining bales our factors deal abroad, And see the country's products, in exchange, Before them heap'd; cotton's transparent webs, Aloes, and cassia, salutiferous drugs, Alom, and lacque, and clouded tortoiseshell, And brilliant diamonds, to decorate Britannia's blooming nymphs. For these, o'er all The kingdoms round, our draperies are dispers'd, O'er Bukor, Cabul, and the Bactrian vales, And Cassimere, and Atoc, on the stream Of old Hydaspes, Porus' hardy realm; And late-discover'd Tibet, where the fleece, By art peculiar, is compress'd and wrought To threadless drap'ry, which in conic forms, Of various hues, their gaudy roofs adorns. The keels, which voyage through Molucca's straits, Amid a cloud of spicy odours sail, From Java and Sumatra breath'd, whose woods Yield fiery pepper, that destroys the moth In woolly vestures: Ternate and Tidore Give to the festal board the fragrant clove And nutmeg, to those narrow bounds confin'd; While gracious nature, with unsparing hand, The needs of life o'er ev'ry region pours. Near those delicious isles, the beauteous coast Of China rears its summits. Know ye not, Ye sons of Trade, that ever-flowery shore, Those azure hills, those woods and nodding rocks? Compare them with the pictures of your chart; Alike the woods and nodding rocks o'erhang. Now the tall glossy towers of porcelain, And pillar'd pagods shine; rejoic'd they see The port of Canton op'ning to their prows, And in the winding of the river moor. Upon the strand they heap their glossy bales, And works of Birmingham, in brass or steel, And flint, and pond'rous lead from deep cells rais'd, Fit ballast in the fury of the storm, That tears the shrouds, and bends the stubborn mast: These for the artists of the fleece procure Various materials; and for affluent life The flavour'd tea, and glossy painted vase; Things elegant, ill-titled luxuries, In temp'rance us'd, delectable and good. They too from hence receive the strongest thread Of the green silkworm. Various is the wealth Of that renown'd and ancient land, secure In constant peace and commerce; till'd to th' height Of rich fertility; where, thick as stars, Bright habitations glitter on each hill, And rock, and shady dale: ev'n on the waves Of copious rivers, lakes, and bord'ring seas, Rise floating villages. No wonder, when In ev'ry province, firm and level roads, And long canals, and navigable streams, Ever, with ease, conduct the works of toil To sure and speedy markets, through the length Of many a crowded region, many a clime, To th' imperial towers of Cambalu, Now Pekin, where the fleece is not unknown; Since Calder's woofs, and those of Exe and Frome, And Yare and Avon slow, and rapid Trent, Thither by Russic caravans are brought, Through Scythia's num'rous regions, waste and wild, Journey immense! which to th' attentive ear, The Muse, in faithful notes, shall brief describe. From the proud mart of Petersburgh, ere-while The wat'ry seat of Desolation wide, Issue these trading caravans, and urge, Through dazzling snows, their dreary trackless road; By compass steering oft from week to week, From month to month; whole seasons view their toils. Neva they pass, and Kesma's gloomy flood, Volga, and Don, and Oka's torrent prone, Threat'ning in vain; and many a cataract In its fall stopp'd, and bound with bars of ice. Close on the left, unnumber'd tracts they view White with continual frost; and on the right The Caspian lake, and ever flow'ry realms, Though now abhorr'd, behind them turn, the haunt Of arbitrary rule, where regions wide Are destin'd to the sword; and on each hand Roads hung with carcases, or under foot Thick strown; while in their rough bewilder'd vales, The blooming rose its fragrance breathes in vain, And silver fountains fall, and nightingales Attune their notes, where none are left to hear. Sometimes o'er level ways, on easy sleds, The gen'rous horse conveys the sons of Trade; And ever and anon the docile dog, And now the light rein-deer, with rapid pace Skims over icy lakes; now slow they climb Aloft o'er clouds, and then adown descend To hollow valleys, till the eye beholds The roofs of Tobol, whose hill-crowning walls Shine, like the rising moon, thro' wat'ry mists: Tobol, th' abode of those unfortunate Exiles of angry state, and thralls of war; Solemn fraternity! where carl, and prince, Soldier, and statesman, and uncrested chief, On the dark level of adversity, Converse familiar; while, amid the cares And toils for hunger, thirst, and nakedness, Their little public smiles, and the bright sparks Of trade are kindled. Trade arises oft, And virtue, from adversity and want; Be witness, Carthage, witness, ancient Tyre, And thou, Batavia, daughter of distress. This, with his hands, which erst the truncheon held, The hammer lifts; another bends and weaves The flexile willow; that the mattock drives: All are employ'd; and by their works acquire Our fleecy vestures. From their tenements, Pleas'd and refresh'd, proceeds the caravan Thro' lively-spreading cultures, pastures green, And yellow tillages in op'ning woods: Thence on, thro' Narim's wilds, a pathless road They force, with rough entangling thorns perplext; Land of the lazy Oztiacs, thin dispers'd, Who, by avoiding, meet the toils they loathe, Tenfold augmented; miserable tribe, Void of commercial comforts; who, nor corn, Nor pulse, nor oil, nor heart-enliv'ning wine, Know to procure; nor spade, nor scythe, nor share, Nor social aid; beneath their thorny bed The serpent hisses, while in thickets nigh Loud howls the hungry wolf. So on they fare, And pass by spacious lakes, begirt with rocks And azure mountains; and the heights admire Of white Imaus, whose snow-nodding crags Frighten the realms beneath, and from their urns Pour mighty rivers down, th' impetuous streams Oby, and Irtis, and Jenisca, swift, Which rush upon the northern pole, upheave Its frozen seas, and lift their hills of ice. These rugged paths and savage landscapes pass'd, A new scene strikes their eyes: among the clouds Aloft they view, what seems a chain of cliffs, Nature's proud work; that matchless work of art, The wall of Sina, by Chihoham's pow'r, In earliest times, erected. Warlike troops Frequent are seen in haughty march along Its ridge, a vast extent, beyond the length Of many a potent empire; tow'rs and ports, Three times a thousand, lift thereon their brows At equal spaces, and in prospect 'round Cities, and plains, and kingdoms, overlook. At length the gloomy passage they attain Of its deep-vaulted gates, whose op'ning folds Conduct at length to Pekin's glitt'ring spires, The destin'd mart, where joyous they arrive. Thus are the textures of the fleece convey'd To Sina's distant realm, the utmost bound Of that flat floor of steadfast earth; for so Fabled antiquity, ere peaceful Trade Inform'd the op'ning mind of curious man. Now to the other hemisphere, my Muse, A new world found, extend thy daring wing. Be thou the first of the harmonious Nine From high Parnassus, the unweary'd toils Of industry and valour, in that world Triumphant, to reward with tuneful song. Happy the voyage o'er th' Atlantic brine By active Raleigh made, and great the joy, When he discern'd, above the foamy surge, A rising coast, for future colonies Op'ning her bays, and figuring her capes, Ev'n from the northern tropic to the pole. No land gives more employment to the loom, Or kindlier feeds the indigent; no land With more variety of wealth rewards The hand of Labour: thither, from the wrongs Of lawless rule, the free-born spirit flies; Thither Affliction, thither Poverty, And Arts and Sciences: thrice happy clime, Which Britain makes th' asylum of mankind. But joy superior far his bosom warms, Who views those shores in ev'ry culture dress'd; With habitations gay, and num'rous towns, On hill and valley, and his countrymen Form'd into various states, pow'rful and rich, In regions far remote: who from our looms Take largely for themselves, and for those tribes Of Indians, ancient tenants of the land, In amity conjoin'd, of civil life The comforts taught, and various new desires, Which kindle arts, and occupy the poor, And spread Britannia's flocks o'er ev'ry dale. Ye, who the shuttle cast along the loom, The silkworm's thread inweaving with the fleece, Pray for the culture of the Georgian tract, Nor slight the green savannahs, and the plains Of Carolina, where thick woods arise Of mulberries, and in whose water'd fields Up springs the verdant blade of thirsty rice. Where are the happy regions, which afford More implements of commerce, and of wealth? Fertile Virginia, like a vig'rous bough, Which overshades some crystal river, spreads Her wealthy cultivations wide around, And, more than many a spacious realm, rewards The fleecy shuttle: to her growing marts The Iroquese, Cheroques, and Oubacks, come, And quit their feath'ry ornaments uncouth, For woolly garments; and the cheers of life, The cheers, but not the vices, learn to taste. Blush, Europeans, whom the circling cup Of luxury intoxicates; ye routs, Who, for your crimes, have fled your native land; And ye voluptuous idle, who, in vain, Seek easy habitations, void of care: The sons of Nature, with astonishment And detestation, mark your evil deeds; And view, no longer aw'd, your nerveless arms, Unfit to cultivate Ohio's banks. See the bold emigrants of Acadie, And Massachusett, happy in those arts, That join the politics of Trade and War, Bearing the palm in either; they appear Better exemplars; and that hardy crew, Who, on the frozen beach of Newfoundland, Hang their white fish amid the parching winds: The kindly fleece, in webs of Duffield woof, Their limbs, benumb'd, enfolds with cheerly warmth, And frieze of Cambria, worn by those, who seek, Thro' gulphs and dales of Hudson's winding bay, The beaver's fur, tho' oft they seek in vain, While winter's frosty rigour checks approach, Ev'n in the fiftieth latitude. Say why (If ye, the travell'd sons of Commerce, know), Wherefore lie bound their rivers, lakes, and dales, Half the sun's annual course, in chains of ice? While the Rhine's fertile shore, and Gallic realms, By the same zone encircled, long enjoy Warm beams of PhÅbus, and, supine, behold Their plains and hillocks blush with clust'ring vines. Must it be ever thus? or may the hand Of mighty Labour drain their gusty lakes, Enlarge the bright'ning sky, and, peopling, warm The op'ning valleys, and the yellowing plains? Or, rather, shall we burst strong Darien's chain, Steer our bold fleets between the cloven rocks, And through the great Pacific ev'ry joy Of civil life diffuse? Are not her isles Num'rous and large? Have they not harbours calm, Inhabitants, and manners? haply, too, Peculiar sciences, and other forms Of trade, and useful products, to exchange For woolly vestures? 'Tis a tedious course By the Antarctic circle: nor beyond Those sea-wrapt gardens of the dulcet reed, Bahama and Caribbee, may be found Safe mole or harbour, till on Falkland's Isle The standard of Britannia shall arise. Proud Buenos Ayres, low-couched Paraguay, And rough Corrientes, mark, with hostile eye, The lab'ring vessel: neither may we trust The dreary naked Patagonian land, Which darkens in the wind. No traffic there, No barter for the fleece. There angry storms Bend their black brows, and, raging, hurl around Their thunders. Ye advent'rous mariners, Be firm; take courage from the brave. 'Twas there Perils and conflicts inexpressible, Anson, with steady undespairing breast, Endur'd, when o'er the various globe he chas'd His country's foes. Fast-gath'ring tempests rous'd Huge ocean, and involv'd him: all around Whirlwind, and snow, and hail, and horror: now, Rapidly, with the world of waters, down Descending to the channels of the deep, He view'd th' uncover'd bottom of th' abyss; And now the stars, upon the loftiest point Toss'd of the sky-mix'd surges. Oft the burst Of loudest thunder, with the dash of seas, Tore the wild-flying sails and tumbling masts; While flames, thick-flashing in the gloom, reveal'd Ruins of decks, and shrouds, and sights of death. Yet on he far'd, with fortitude his cheer, Gaining, at intervals, slow way beneath Del Fuego's rugged cliffs, and the white ridge, Above all height, by op'ning clouds reveal'd, Of Montegorda, and inaccessible Wreck-threatening Staten-land's o'erhanging shore, Enormous rocks on rocks, in ever-wild Posture of falling; as when Pelion, rear'd On Ossa, and on Ossa's tott'ring head Woody Olympus, by the angry gods Precipitate on earth were doom'd to fall. At length, through ev'ry tempest, as some branch, Which from a poplar falls into a loud Impetuous cataract, though deep immers'd, Yet reascends, and glides, on lake or stream, Smooth through the valleys: so his way he won To the serene Pacific, flood immense, And rear'd his lofty masts, and spread his sails. Then Paita's walls, in wasting flames involv'd, His vengeance felt, and fair occasion gave To show humanity and continence, To Scipio's not inferior. Then was left No corner of the globe secure to pride And violence: although the far-stretch'd coast Of Chili, and Peru, and Mexico, Arm'd in their evil cause; though fell disease, Un'bating labour, tedious time, conspir'd, And heat inclement, to unnerve his force; Though that wide sea, which spreads o'er half the world, Deny'd all hospitable land or port; Where, seasons voyaging, no road he found To moor, no bottom in th' abyss, whereon To drop the fast'ning anchor; though his brave Companions ceas'd, subdu'd by toil extreme; Though solitary left in Tinian's seas, Where never was before the dreaded sound Of Britain's thunder heard; his wave-worn bark Met, fought, the proud Iberian, and o'ercame. So fare it ever with our country's foes. Rejoice, ye nations, vindicate the sway Ordain'd for common happiness. Wide, o'er The globe terraqueous, let Britannia pour The fruits of plenty from her copious horn. What can avail to her, whose fertile earth By ocean's briny waves are circumscrib'd, The armed host, and murd'ring sword of war, And conquest o'er her neighbours? She ne'er breaks Her solemn compacts in the lust of rule: Studious of arts and trade, she ne'er disturbs The holy peace of states. 'Tis her delight To fold the world with harmony, and spread, Among the habitations of mankind, The various wealth of toil, and what her fleece, To clothe the naked, and her skilful looms, Peculiar give. Ye too, rejoice, ye swains; Increasing commerce shall reward your cares. A day will come, if not too deep we drink The cup, which luxury on careless wealth, Pernicious gift, bestows; a day will come When, through new channels sailing, we shall clothe The Californian coast, and all the realms That stretch from Anian's Straits to proud Japan, And the green isles, which on the left arise Upon the glassy brine, whose various capes Not yet are figur'd on the sailor's chart: Then ev'ry variation shall be told Of the magnetic steel, and currents mark'd, Which drive the heedless vessel from her course. That portion too of land, a tract immense, Beneath th' Antarctic spread, shall then be known, And new plantations on its coast arise. Then rigid winter's ice no more shall wound The only naked animal; but man With the soft fleece shall everywhere be cloth'd. Th' exulting Muse shall then, in vigour fresh, Her flight renew. Meanwhile, with weary wing, O'er ocean's wave returning, she explores Siluria's flow'ry vales, her old delight, The shepherd's haunts, where the first springs arise Of Britain's happy trade, now spreading wide, Wide as th' Atlantic and Pacific seas, Or as air's vital fluid o'er the globe. TO AARON HILL, ESQ., ON HIS POEM CALLED âGIDEON.â Tell me, wondrous friend! where were you When Gideon was your lofty song? Where did the heaving spirit bear you When your fair soul reflected strong Gideon's actions, as they shin'd Bright in the chambers of the mind? Say, have you trod Arabia's spicy vales, Or gather'd bays beside Euphrates' stream, Or lonely sung with Jordan's waterfalls, While heav'nly Gideon was your sacred theme? Or have you many ages given To close retirement and to books, And held a long discourse with Heaven, And noticed Nature in her various looks? Full of inspiring wonder and delight, Slow read I Gideon with a greedy eye, Like a pleas'd traveller, that lingers sweet On some fair and lofty plain Where the sun does brightly shine, And glorious prospects all around him lie. On Gideon's pages beautifully shine Surprising pictures rising to my sight, With all the life of colour and of line, And all the force of rounding shade and light, And all the grace of something more divine. High on a hill, beneath an oak's broad arm, I see a youth divinely fair! âPensive he leans his head on his left hand; His smiling eye sheds sweetness mix'd with awe; His right hand with a milk-white wand some figure seems to draw! A nameless grace is scatter'd through his air, And o'er his shoulders loosely flows his amber-colour'd hair.â Above, with burning blush, the morning glows, The waking world all fair before him lies; âSlow from the plain the melting dews, To kiss the sunbeams, climbing, rise.â Methinks the grove of Baal I see, In terrac'd stages mount up high, And wave its sable beauties in the sky: âFrom stage to stage broad steps of half-hid stone, With curly moss and bladed grass o'ergrown, Lead awfulââ Down in a dungeon deep, âWhere through thick walls, oblique, the broken light From narrow loop-holes quivers to the sight, With swift and furious stride. Close-folded arms, and short and sudden starts, The fretful prince, in dumb and sullen pride, Resolves escape.ââ Here in red colours, glowing bold, A war-like figure strikes my eye. The dreadful sudden sight his foes behold. Confounded so, they lose the power to fly; âBackening they gaze at distance on his face, Admire his posture, and confess his grace; His right hand grasps his planted spear.â Alas! my Muse! Through much good will you err, And we the mighty Author greatly wrong, To gather beauties here and there, As but a scatter'd few they were, While ev'ry word's a beauty in his song! TO MR. SAVAGE, SON OF THE LATE EARL RIVERS. Sink not, my friend! beneath misfortune's weight, Pleas'd to be found intrinsically great. Shame on the dull! who think the soul looks less Because the body wants a glitt'ring dress; It is the mind's for ever bright attire, The mind's embroidery, that the wise admire. That which looks rich to the gross vulgar eyes, Is the fop's tinsel, which the grave despise; Wealth dims the eyes of crowds, and while they gaze, The coxcomb's ne'er discovered in the blaze. As few the vices of the wealthy see, So virtues are conceal'd by poverty. Earl Rivers! In that name how would'st thou shine! Thy verse how sweet! Thy fancy how divine! Critics and bards would, by their worth be aw'd, And all would think it merit to applaud. But thou hast nought to please the vulgar eye, No title hast, nor what might titles buy. Thou wilt small praise, but much ill-nature find, Clear to thy errors, to thy beauties blind; And if, though few, they any faults can see, How meanly bitter will cold censure be! But since we all, the wisest of us, err, Sure it's the greatest fault to be severe. A few, however, yet expect to find Among the misty millions of mankind, Who proudly stoop to aid an injured cause, And o'er the sneer of coxcombs force applause; Who with felt pleasure see fair Virtue rise, And lift her upward to the beckoning prize; Or mark her labouring in the modest breast, And honour her the more, the more deprest. Thee, Savage! these (the justly great) admire; Thee, quick'ning judgments phlegm with fancy's fire; Thee slow to censure, earnest to commend, An able critic, but a willing friend. A NIGHT PROSPECT. WRITTEN ON LINCOLN HEATH, 1751. [FROM THE MSS.] Nigh are the rising spires of Lamplugh's fane, Stateliest of Gothic fabrics; and the crags Of ruins glimmer: every zephyr brings Into my ears the slow deep-swelling toll Of the great curfew. So, the traveller, On Lindum's heath, secure, may bate his pace, Pleased with the mild descent of purple night; While o'er the circles of her solemn vault, Eternal Wisdom with almighty hand Rolls worlds and worlds. Behold those glittering stars, And open all thy mind to think the space, Hence to each orb, that makes such glorious suns So small appear! Their moons and earths, like ours, Which round them move, are lost to ardent sight; So vast extends the distance! Yet on those Planets, to us invisible, are spread Europes and Asias, regions not unlike To those we act on. Hark, ye things of pride! God, ever gracious, sends his suns abroad To light, and cheer, and bless more realms and worlds, Than folly's narrow thought can reach to damn. AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND IN TOWN. Have my friends in the Town, the busy, gay Town, Forgot such a man as John Dyer? Or heedless despise they, or pity the clown, Whose bosom no pageantries fire? No matter, no matter, content in the shadesâ Contented! why everything charms meâ Fall in tune all adown the green steep, ye cascades! Till hence rigid Virtue alarms me. Till Outrage arises, or Misery needs The swift, the intrepid avenger: Till sacred Religion, or Liberty bleedsâ Then mine be the deed, or the danger. Alas! what a folly, that wealth and domain We heap up in sin and in sorrow! Immense is the toil, yet the labour how vain! Is not life to be over to-morrow? Then glide on my moments, the few that I have, Sweet-shaded, and quiet, and even, While gently the body descends to the grave, And the spirit arises to heaven. ON THE DESTRUCTION OF LISBON, 1756. One moment overturns the toils of man, And humbles greatness: Lisbon sinks in dust. Earthquakes, and floods, and fires, and falling towers, Thunder among the scatter'd crowds! Rich, poor, Young, old, slave, peasant, prince, unheeded, fly, From the swift rage of death, and strive to grasp At wretchedness! When I consider these; When I consider scenes of ancient times, Ruins on ruins, thrones on buried thrones; And walk on earth as on a globe of graves; When the high heavens I view, and there behold Planets, stars, comets, worlds innumerous, To splendour rising, and from splendour fall'n; My spirits shrink within me: what is man! How poor a worm!âbut, when I meditate His boundless cogitations, high desires; And th' infinite Creator, all in all, Gracious and wise;âeach gloomy fear retires, And heaven's eternal light revives my soul. FOR DR. MACKENZIE'S BOOK, âTHE HISTORY OF HEALTH,â ETC. 1756. When long experience, with sagacious thought, And learning, and benevolence, and care, Retires to form a work for human use, No vulgar gift expect. No vulgar gift Is that which gives, to every good we taste, Its pleasing relish. Who will not desire To share preventive wisdom? far, far off, To drive the hag, distemper? Health, preserved, With far more vigour blooms than health restored. So high has been the strain of gratitude, That divine honours were to PhÅbus given, And Ãsculapius, and the Coan sage, Who the Mackenzies were of ancient days. PARAPHRASE OF PART OF CHAPTER XII. OF ECCLESIASTES. Now thy Creator, in the prime of youth, Remember; ere those evil days approach When every withering nerve must cease to feel The touch of worldly pleasures: while the sun And moon, and spangled stars, on the high vault Of heaven, thou canst behold, that teach thy mind Worship and praise: ere yet the shadows fall Of life's dank evening; ere thy mortal frame Around thee shrink, and trembling hands and knees Fail to sustain thee; when the lightest thing, The nimble grasshopper, a burden drops Upon thy bending shoulders; and thick gloom O'erspread thy windows; when the grinders cease Their preparations for the chemic work Of balmy nutriment, and the sweet notes, With which the daughters of harmonious sound Play on thy slackened ears, are faintly heard; Ill hour of penitence. Now, in thy prime, Or ever broken be the golden bowl, Or loosed the silver cord, or e'er the wheel Breaks at his source, which rolls the vital streamâ Remember thy Creator; that thy soul, When earth to earth, when dust to dust returns, May reascend to heaven, and, at His throne, Receive the fulness of immortal joy. TO HIS SON. Temperance, exercise, and air, Make thee strong and debonair; Quiet, competence, and health, Furnish thee with real wealth; Truth, humility, and love, Lead thee to the bliss above. More, at best, is but a bubble, More is often toil and trouble. THE END.</field>
