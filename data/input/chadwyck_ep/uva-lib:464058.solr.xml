Incipit Prologus de Historia Britannie transumpta per Robertum in materna lingua. Lordynges that be now here, if ?e wille listene &amp; lere All the story of Inglande als Robert Mannyng wryten it fand, &amp; on Inglysch has it schewed, not for þe lerid bot for þe lewed, ffor þo þat in þis land[e] wone þat þe Latyn no Frankys cone, ffor to haf solace &amp; game? In felawschip whe? þai sitt samen. And it is wisdom for to wytten þe state of þe land, &amp; haf it wryten, what manere of folk first it wan, &amp; of what kynde it first began; And gude it is for many thynges for to here þe dedis of kynges, whilk were foles, &amp; whilk were wyse, &amp; whilk of þam couthe most quantyse, and whilk did wrong, &amp; whilk ryght, &amp; whilk maynten[e]d pes &amp; fyght. Of þare dedes sall be my sawe; &amp; what tyme, &amp; of what lawe I sall yow schewe fro gre to gre sen þe tyme of sir Noe, ffro Noe vnto Eneas, &amp; what betwix þam was; And fro Eneas till Brutus tyme, ffro Brutus till Cadwaladres, þe last Bryton þat þis lande lees. All þat kynde &amp; all þe frute þat come of Brutus, þat is þe Brute; And þe ryght Brute is told nomore þan þe Brytons tyme wore. After þe Bretons þe Inglis camen, þe lordschip of þis lande þai namen, Southe &amp; northe; west &amp; est, þat calle me? now þe Inglis gest. when þai first [came] amang þe Bretons, þat now ere Inglis, þan were Saxons; Saxons Inglis hight alle oliche; þai aryued vp at Sandwyche In þe kynges tyme Vortogerne, þat þe lande walde þam not werne. þat were Maysters of alle þe toþire, Hengist he hight, &amp; Hors his broþire; þes were hede, als we fynde, where-of is comen oure Inglis kynde. A hundrethe &amp; fifty ?ere þai com or þai receyued cristendo?; So lang woned þai þis lande in, or þai herde out of Saynt Austyn, Amang þe Bretons with mykelle wo, In sclaundire &amp; threte, &amp; in thro. þes Inglis dedes ?e may here, as Pers telles alle þe manere. One Mayster Wace þe ffrankes telles, þe Brute, all þat þe Latyn spelles, ffro Eneas till Cadwaladre; þis Mayster Wace þer leues he. And ryght as Mayster Wace says, I telle myn Inglis þe same ways; ffor Mayster Wace þe Latyn alle rymes þat Pers ouerhippis many tymes. Mayster Wace þe Brute alle redes, &amp; Pers tellis alle þe Inglis dedes; þer Mayster Wace of þe Brute left, ryght begynnes Pers [þer] eft, And tellis forth þe Inglis story, &amp; as he says, þan say I. Als þai haf wryte? &amp; sayd, haf I alle in myn Inglis layd, In symple speche as I couthe, þat is lightest in mannes mouthe. I mad noght for no disours, ne for no seggers, no harpours, Bot for þe luf of symple me? þat strange Inglis ca? not ke?; ffor many it ere þat strange Inglis In ryme wate neuer what it is; And bot þai wist what it mente, ellis me thoght it were alle schente. I made it not forto be praysed, bot at þe lewed me? were aysed. If it were made in ryme couwee, or in strangere or enterlace, þat rede Inglis it ere inowe, þat couthe not haf coppled a kowe, þat outhere in couwee or in baston som suld haf ben fordon, so þat fele men þat it herde suld not witte howe þat it ferde: I see in song, in sedgeyng tale of Erceldoun &amp; of Kendale, Non þam says as þai þam wroght, &amp; in þer sayng it semes noght; þat may þou here in sir Tristrem; ouer gestes it has þe steem, Ouer alle that is or was, if me? it sayd as made Thomas; But I here it no ma? so say, þat of som copple som is away; So þare fayre sayng here befor? is þare trauayle nere forlor?; þai sayd it for pride &amp; nobleye, þat non were suylk as þei; And all þat þai wild ouerwhere, all þat ilk will now forfare. þai sayd in so quante Inglis þat many one wate not what it is. þerfore [I] henyed wele þe more In strange ryme to trauayle sore; And my witte was oure thynne So strange speche to trauayle in; And forsoth I couth[e] noght so strange Inglis as þai wroght; And me? besoght me many a tyme to turne it bot in light[e] ryme; þai sayd, if I in strange it turne, to here it manyon suld skurne; ffor it ere names full selcouthe þat ere not vsed now in mouthe; And þerfore for þe comonalte þat blythely wild listen to me, On light[e] lange I it bega?, for luf of þe lewed ma?, to telle þam þe chaunces bolde þat here before was don &amp; tolde. ffor þis makyng I will no mede bot gude prayere when ?e it rede; þerfore, [alle] ?e lordes lewed, ffor wham I haf þis Inglis schewed, Prayes to God he gyf me grace,— I trauayled for ?our solace;— Of Brunne I am, if any me blame, Robert Mannyng is my name; Blissed be he of God of heuene þat me, Robert, with gude wille neuene; In þe third Edwardes tyme was I whe? I wrote alle þis story, In þe hous of Sixille I was a throwe; Danz Robert of Malto? þat ?e know, did it wryte for felawes sake, whe? þai wild solace make. Dares Frigius, qui historiam Troianorum scripsit, ait se militasse vsque dum Troia capta est, hosque duces se vidisse cum indutie essent &amp; partim prelio interfuisse. Dares the Freson of Troie first wrote, &amp; putt it in buke þat we now wote; he was a clerk and a gude knyght, when Troie was lorn he sawe þat fight; Alle þe barons wele he knewe, he tellis þer stature &amp; þer hewe, long or schorte, whyte or blak, alle he telles, gude or lak. Alle þer lymmes, how þai besemed, In his buke has Dares demed, Both of Troie &amp; of Grece, whatkyns schappe was ilka pece; Of manyon he reknes &amp; sayes, both of Troiens &amp; of Gregeis, þat it were oure long to telle, &amp; many wald not þer-in duelle þare names alle forto here, bot þe Latyn is fayre to lere. Ego Galfridus Arthurus Monemutensis, qui hanc historiam Britonum de eorum lingua in nostram transferre curaui, dimitto fortunas successoribus meis scribendas. Geffrey Arthure of Minumue, fro Breton speche he did remue, &amp; made it alle in Latyn þat clerkes haf now knawyng in. In Gloucestre was fonden a buke þat þe Inglis couthe not rede no luke, On þat langage þai knew no herde; bot an erle þat hyght Roberde, he prayed þat ilk clerk Geffrey to turne it fro þat speche away In-to Latyn, as it mente, þat þe Inglis mot know þe entente; ffor Geffrey knew þe langage wele, In Latyn he broght it ilka dele. Siþen com a clerk, Mayster Wace, to make romance had he grace, &amp; turned it ro Latyne, &amp; rymed it in Frankis fyne vnto þe Cadwaladres; no forer, þer makes he ses. Als Geffrey in Latyn sayd, so Mayster Wace in Frankis layd; þe date of Criste was þan þis lyue, A thousand ?ere fifty &amp; fyue. Than com out of Brydlyngton Pers of Langtoft, a chanon; Als Mayster Wace þe same he says, bot he rymed it oþer ways; he begynnes at Eneas, of alle þe Brute he tellis þe pas, &amp; s[i]þen alle þe Inglis dedis; feyrere langage non ne redis. After þe Inglis kynges he says þer pris þat all in metir fulle wele lys; And I, Robert, fulle fayn wald bringe In Inglis tonge þer faire saiynge. God gyve me grace wel to spede, þys rym on Englische for to rede. Genealogia primi regis Troge &amp; Enee a Noe et Saphet vsque ad Loquerinum deducta.

His sone was cald sire Saphet. Iauan, his sone þat cam of hym, He hadde a sone þat hight Setym; Setymes sone, Ciprius hight, A man of ffame &amp; of myght; So mikel þat tyme was his fame, þe lande of Cipre of hym had name. Of þys noble sire Cyprius, Was a sone þat hight Cretus; þis Cretus an ilde he augte, þe name of hym Cret hit laughte.

At þat metyng (among ylkon) Taken was sire Antygon, &amp; an oþer, sire Anacletoun. &amp; best of hem were born doun: Þyse two prisons, Brutus þem led; Of þeym of Grece, fewe þer fledde. Pandras þe kyng had sorw in sight Þat he was so al desconfit, &amp; þat his brother taken was; He com ageyn into þat pas, &amp; wende haue founde Brutus þore,— Help he hadde, &amp; purueyed more,— Bot Brutus was til his castles gon Wiþ Antygo &amp; Anacleton; He warnysched hem wiþ men of armes, ffor he dredde deseite &amp; harmes. Whon þe kyng fond hym þer nought, To bisege þe castel he þought; Vnto þe sege he hym hastede His purueaunce he wold were wastede; Berfreys dide make to gyue assaut Þat Brutus mought falle y þe faut; To mangeneles he dide make stones, Wiþ þer assaut to casten alle at ones. Þey wyþynne stode in karneles, Wyþ arblastes schotten ageyn quarels, &amp; grete tres ful vnryde Þey caste agein on ylk a side; Enginours þey hadde wyþynne ynowe, At þeym wyþouten ageyn to þrowe, Þat non dyrste comen þe wal ney, Bot for drede hel[d] þeym a drey; Þey casten wyldfyr wiþ engynes.

Þe sege was hard to þeym wyþynne, &amp; þey wyþoute myghte nought wynne, Ne nought ne schold, of ful fer longe, ?yf hit ne were for honger stronge; Þe faute þey dredde comynge byforn, Þe host was mykel, &amp; lite had corn; Þey asked Brutes of conseill, What þey schold do for more vitail: “Conseile vs er hit be goon, “Hit ys to late whan we haue non, “Whan we haue nough[t] vs to fede, “Þe castel most we ?elde nede.” Þus þey seide, þe men were wyse, &amp; Brutus byþoughte hym of queintise: Queyntise bihouede hym nedly þenke, Þat his enemy schold waite a blenk; &amp; mykel peril byhoues hym haue, Þat auntres hym his frend to saue. Brutus had yn his prison Antygon &amp; Anacleton; Brutes tok hym by þe top, &amp; seide, “Hedles schal þou hop! “Bot þou do als y þe seye, “Of myn hand[e] schalt þou deye, “Boþe þe kynges broþer and þou; “&amp; boþe myght þou saue now.” “Sire,” he seide, “do ?our wille! “How mygh[t] y vs saue fro ylle, “Sey me, sire, on what manere; “&amp; ?yf y may, y wol ?ow here.” Brutus seyde, “þou schalt go “Alone to nyght, wyþouten mo, “To þeym þat loke þat on entre, “&amp; sey til hem als y sey þe: “Sey þou hast stolen þe kynges brother “Out of prison, &amp; non oþer; “In to þe wode þou hast hym led, “Bot ferrer may þou nought, for dred, “ffor þo men þat þe wode loke, “Þat hym ne þe þey ouertoke; “Bot ilkon, bid hem come wiþ þe, “Þat noman byhinde be; “&amp; we schul be busched þer biside, “&amp; ?yf y may, þey schol abyde “Þat þey ne go nought vs to wrye, “Ne [nought] desturble me my weye.” Anacletus graunted wel, ?yf Brutus wold be tryst as stel Þat his lyf he wolde hym saue. Brutus dide hym sykernesse haue. Anacletus, forþ he went, &amp; dide als Brutus had hym sent. At bed-tyme, when men were in rest, Brutus wiþ his folk was prest, &amp; wel armed wente þer weye Þer he knew by o valeye. In þe wode bisides þat entre He busched hem in parties þre.

Þe Troiens þat had ben yn turpel, At midnight tok þey conseil, Þat Coryneus out scholde go Wiþ his owen ost, &amp; no mo, &amp; busche hym in a wode byside: “Þe frankisch ost ?e schul here bide, “&amp; whan þer ost ys al comen, “&amp; ?e haue a-geyn þem nomen, “Þan schol þey se þat ?e ar fo, “Þey schol nought drede on ?ow to go. “&amp; take non auisement, “ffor ?e ar fewe, þey schol nought tent, “&amp; ?e schal abate ?ow hardely, “ffor atte here bak y come redy; “Þe maistrie schal oures be, “ffor coward elles hald þou me.” Coryneus he dighte hem ?erne, &amp; went out at þe day[e] sterne, &amp; busched þem on a rowe þat þe Frensche moughte þem nought knowe. þe Peyteuyns comen atte morwen tyde, þe Troiens a-geyn þem gon ride Turynus a knyght, Brutus cosyn, He parted þe host of [þe] Peyteuyn, &amp; rod þer host al þorow out, Might noman bere his strokes stout; Merueyloslike was he hardy, His hardinesse was foly; In al þe host ne hadde he pere, Of no strengthe þat men myght here, (Bot þe geaunt, sire Coryne, ?it was he al so strong as he:) He triste to mykel on his myght; Ouer fer he ?ede on hem to fight: He had slayn, þe story seys, Six hundred Peyteuyns &amp; Fraunceys; Siþen com alle þe frankische route, &amp; closed hym yn al aboute. De occisisione Turnij, &amp; edificacione castri de Toures in Turonia. Er þan ouer cam Coryneus, Er was he slayn, þis knyght Turnus. Right to ded as he was kast, Brutus hasted hym ferly fast, And tok þe body fro þeym alle Er he of his hors gan falle, And bar hit vp vntil his tour, þer was he beryed wyþ honur. ffor loue of Turnus, þat gode knyght, Toures in Tureyne now hit hight; &amp; after Toures þat ilke cite; Tureyne hat al þat contre. Brutus retorned to þat fyght, And Coryneus halp wiþ al his myght; Þe ffrankische host was al by-twene, Bytwyxt þeym to þey made al clene Of ffrankische &amp; of Peyteuyns; Þey leye in dykes &amp; in kynes, Þey soughten how þey mought hem hyde, In bataille woltey no lenger byde. Whan al was fled, &amp; [þe] feld was playn, Brutus turned his folk a-geyn; Ilkon to þer castel went, &amp; þen þey helde a parlement. Þer parlement, þys was þe ende, “Euerylkon to schip schold wende, “&amp; drawe þer vitaille to þe se, “&amp; weyue al þat ilk contre.” When þey had don as y ?ow seye, Þey set vp seyl, &amp; went þer weye; Þey seyled boþe day &amp; nyght, Þat neuere striken, bot ay vpright, Til þey aryved—as our book seys— In Dertemuithe at Toteneys. Hic primo Brutus intrauit Albion cum suo nauigio apud Toteneys. Al holyke com þer flote In Dertemuthe, at o schote; þat ys þe Ilde þat dame Dyane Hyght Brutus &amp; his kynde alane. Out of þe schip þey com tyl land Wiþ mykel ioye, y vnderstand, When þey wyste þat þey were set To wone þer Diane had þem het, In þat Ilde of Albyon, &amp; þenked þer godes euerilkon. þat ylke tyme was nought late,— fful longe hit ys, as seyþ þe date,— þat tyme þat Brutes aryued her, A þousand &amp; two hunded ?er, So mykel was hit byforn Er Iesu was of Marye born. In þat tyme wer here non hauntes Of no men bot of geauntes. (Geaunt ys more þan man; So seys þe bok, for y ne can; Lyke men þey ar in flesche &amp; bon; In my tyme saw y neuere non. Of membres haue þey liknes þe lymes alle þat in man ys.) Twenty geauntz were in þys lond; Of on þe name wryten y fond, Gogmagog, þus was told; ffor he was strong, gret, &amp; bold, Gogmagog þus men hym calle; Þey seyden he was most of alle. Þe Troiens, when þey þe geauntz sawe, Wyþ þer bowes at þeym gon drawe, &amp; also wyþ dart &amp; spere. þe geauntz couþe hem nought were; Vp to þe hilles fro þem þey wend, &amp; left þe Troiens þe pleyn lond. A day þe Troiens made þer feste After þe manere of þer geste, Wyþ caroles, trompes, &amp; pypyng, ffor ioie of þer newe wonyng. Whan þey had karoled alder best, &amp; ilkon schold han go to rest, So come þe geauntz þat ylke nyght, &amp; on þe Troiens smyte doun ryght. fformest was sire Gogmagog, He was most, þat foule froge; Þey faught wyþ trees þat þey vp drowe,— Y can nought seye whilk þey slow,— Oþer wepen had þey non, Bot smyten wiþ tres or casten ston. When þey had fought, &amp; went to fle, In to þe hilles a-gayn to be, Þan were þe Troiens þeym bifore, &amp; gaf þem woundes depe &amp; sore, &amp; slowe þem þe moste part Wiþ spere &amp; bowe, swerd &amp; dart. Gogmagog, þe Troiens tok; þan saide Brutus ‘þat þey schold lok ‘Wheþer he wer strenger, or Cornyus.’ A place to pleye, ordeyned Brutus,— Corineus was wel of þat graunt— ffor to wrastle wyþ þat geaunt; On a clyf faste by þe se Þe wrastlyng was ordeyned to be; Alle þey ?ede, ?onge &amp; elde, Þat wrastlyng to byhelde. De ludo inter Coryneum &amp; Gogmagogum. Coryneus first vp he stirt, &amp; wyþ a cloþ his body gyrt; Strait in þe flank dide hym lace, &amp; com &amp; stod forth y þe place. Þen Gogmagog ros vp sone; He hadde hym dight, &amp; was al bone. Þe firste pul so harde was set Þat þeyr brestes to-gyder met; Þeir handes ouer bakkes þey caste, Syde to syde was set ful faste; Þer was turn ageynes turn; Þat waykest was, byhoued spurn. ffor-setten byfore, &amp; eke byhynde, Wyþ crokes ilkon oþer gan bynde; Oft aboute ilk oþer þrew, þe stem stod vp, so þey blew. þey handled boþe sore þer nekkes; Chynnes, chekes, gef harde chekkes; Þeyr teþ gnaisted wiþ nose snore, Hurtlede hedes set ful sore; Ilk oþer pulled, ilk oþer schok, Wiþ fet in fourche ilk oþer tok. Wyþ trip forsetten, ilk oþer to gyle, In lyft in wryþyng þey sayed vmwhile; Ilkon fro erthe dide oþer ryse Wyþ strengþe more þan wyþ queintise. Gogmagog proued his strengþe,— Twelue cubyte he was in lengþe,— In armes Coryneus he laught, &amp; on hym drow so strong a draught þat þre rybbes brosten in his side, &amp; had ner cast him [at] þat tyde. Þen was Coryneus a-schamed Þat he was for þe geaunt lamed; He recouered his strengþe for tene, Of skaþe wold he hym no more mene; Wyþ þat þe geaunt [anon] he hente, &amp; in his armes so hym wente Þat Gogmagog gan to swowene, &amp; bar hym wyþ þe bank [a]doune; Doun of þe roche he let hym falle— þerfore ffaleys men gon hit calle;— Er he cam doun, was flesche &amp; bon Al to-ryuen fro ston to ston. A gret þrowe þer he lay ded, Þe water of his blod was red. Brutus ordinauit &amp; fecit manciones per loca. When þe geauntz were o dawe, þe Troiens hadden na more awe; Tounes, houses, dide þey make, &amp; mesured lond, &amp; dide hit stake þat ilkon dide his owen knowe; þen tyled þey lond, &amp; dide hit sowe. þat tyme þys lond hight Albyon; When Brutus cam, þat name was gon; ffor Albion was Brutes wayne, þerfore he dide hit calle Brutayne. When he &amp; hise fro Troye nam, Troiens were called til þey þer cam; After þe Troiens þys name was set, ffor name of Brutes first highte Bret; Afterward hit turned eftsones, ffor Brutus folk was cald Brutones. þat name held hit of Bretoun Long syþen þe Incarnacion, Til Gormound cam &amp; he[re] gan aryue, Þe Brutons awey he dide hem dryue. Vneþe siþen any on ros Þat longe bar any los. Þat of his spoken mykel in dede; Ney atte þe ende ?e may hit rede. Coryneus hadde a god party Of þe lond, for he was worþy. Þer Corineus dide bataille, Þat contre he tok þat highte Waille; Of Corni &amp; Waille, þat was wynnyng, Hadde Cornewaille þe name gynny[n]g; Cornewaille com of Coryneus, &amp; Brutayne com of sire Brutus. Ilkon to þeym þer frendes drow, &amp; bygged lond[e] for þeir prow: ffro stede to stede gon þey wende; Þer best was, þer wolde þey lende, &amp; multeplyed, &amp; wel þrof, &amp; woxen riche, kant &amp; cof. In fewe ?eres al þe kynde Of folk, þey woxen mykel mynde. Constructio Noue Troie, qui iam dicitur Londonia. Brutus byhe[d] þe mountaynes &amp; auised hym o þe playnes, biheld þe wodes, watres, &amp; ffen, Where esyest wony[n]g were for men; Als watres ronnen wel, he byheld, &amp; mede wiþ þe eryed feld, What fruyt he hoped hit wolde bere. His folk wax faste his lond to were, He þoughte in herte he wolde do make A newe biggyng for Troyes sake; A stede to seche he ?ede to se, Wher he best þoughte, &amp; most ayse. A water he fond, &amp; cald hit Tamyse, After his langage, þer on his wyse: “Y schal sette her, oure kynde to ioye, “A cite for þe loue of Troye; “ffor Troye was so noble a cite, “Newe Troye þe name schal be.” Newe Troye longe hit hight, Tyl som men come wiþ langage lyght,— Schort speche hadde þey in haunt,— &amp; cald Newe Troye, Trenouant. Al ys on, ho so hit knewe, Trenouant &amp; Troye newe; Troye newe ys Trenouant, Two wordes in on, &amp; non ys want. þen cam a kyng, Lud was his name, &amp; made a gate in þat same; Kaer Lud þe name laught, ffor loue of Lud þat hit aught; ffor to haue of hym renoun, Kaer Lud þey calde þe toun. When Saxons com, þat name ne couthe,— Þer owen speche was best yn mouþe— þey cald hit Ludden &amp; London: þus þe name cam eft don, London, on Saxons langage. Now Englysche holden þate heritage, Als men of oþer nations þat han be here syþ þe Bretons; As þe names of contres Ben chaunged, &amp; lawes &amp; fees, ffro þe firste þat þey were named, Als straunge folk han hider y-samed. Whan Brutus had set his cite &amp; burgeys mad, &amp; gaf þeym fee, In lawe wysly to welde, &amp; pes to haue in ?onkþe &amp; elde, He regned ffoure &amp; twenty ?er In al Bretaigne fer &amp; ner. Al was Brutaigne, by elde tales, Engelond, Scotlond, &amp; Walys, þyse þre were þenne al on, þat erest was cald Albyon; Albion highte þyse londes þre, ffor þey ar closed al wiþ þe se. Post decessum Bruty, regnauit Lokerynus filius eius. Brutus had wyþ Ignogyn þre childre: þe eldest hight Lokeryn, Þat oþer, Kamber &amp; Albanak; þise lyuede byhynde Brutus bak, &amp; buryed hym, his sones þre. When he was ded in his cite, Þyse þre brethere in loue &amp; pes Parted þe lond, &amp; ilkon ches, &amp; held þem payed on þer partys, Als þe þre royames lys. Lokeryn ches first, he was eldest; þys lond of Logres hit fel hym best. Logeres hit ys after his name; ffor Lokeryn, Logers had hit þe name. Kamber til his part gan ?erne North west þe water of Seuerne, In length, in brede, als hit [gan] lye, &amp; for his name kald hit Kambrie: Kambrie hit highte, by þo tales, Þat lond þat now ys cleped Wales; &amp; for þe quen dame Galaes, ffor loue of hure, þat name þey ches. Somme now seye for oþer reson Galeys was cald, for duk Galon: Whylom þys duk was of power, &amp; gret renoun hadde fer &amp; ner. Albanak was ?ongest of alle, þe moste wodeland gan hym falle. Albanak kalde his partie After his name, Albanie: Albanie highte þat now ys Scotland, As y schal ?ow telle how y fand: þe name of Scotlon, þe firste rote Hit was gyuen a mayden Scote; Scote was ffaraones doughter þe kynge, Tyl Scotland was scho wedded ?ynge, And was til hire gyuen, &amp; scheo hit aughte; Of hire þe name Scotland laughte. Numbert, a kyng o Huneys, A robbour he was al, hit seys; He robbed þe ildes alle a-boute; Of lyþer men he hadde gret route. Of Albanye men til hym spak, Þat was a childes Albanak: Wiþ Albanak fayn wold he fyght, &amp; Albanak faste ageyn hym dight; Bot Albanak sone þer he slow; His folk fledde, &amp; southeward drow, &amp; pleyned þem to sire Lokeryn How þey ascaped wiþ mykel pyn. Lokeryn vntil Kamber sent; Þey gadered host, &amp; þyder went. A-gayn þeim com sire Numbert; Of þeym boþe was he nought ferd. In an arme of þe se Met þey to-gidere alle þre. þe Bretons were wel mo þan he; In-to þat water þey dide hem fle; þey ne ascaped for no thyng &amp; so þer drenkled Humbert þe kyng. ffor Humbert gan þer mys-falle, Sire Lokeryn dide þe water calle Humber, after sire Humbert, ffor he dreynte þerin in apert. ffro Alemaigne sire Humbert cam, Þe ildes he robbed al so he nam. Sire Lokeryn tok þat he had reft, Þre faire maydenes in his schip were left: þe kynges doughter of Germyne Was þe fairest of alle þre. Sire Lokery[n] byheld faste þat may, Scheo was þe fairest til his pay; Tendrely he dide hure ?eme, Of alle scheo was most til his queme; Estrilde þat maiden hight, Was non so fair in Lokerynes sight. Corineus, ?it lyued he þo, He hadde a doughter, &amp; no mo; He had spoken wiþ Lokeryn To wedde his doughter Gwyndolyn; Lokeryn &amp; he were in couenaunt, &amp; þey boþe had mad þe graunt, Þat, for þe loue of fair Estrilde, Lokeryn haf brokene hit, fayn he wylde. Corineus herde hit sone seye: þer Lokeryn was, he tok þe weye; An ax in his hand he tok, On Lokeryn loþliche gan he lok, &amp; angrily til hym he spak,— Nought bot wrathe his mouþ brak,— He seide, “Lokeryn, þou art a fol! “þy selue dightest þe to dol: “þy ded of me þen schalt þou haue; “Þer-fro noman schal þe saue. “Why hast þou my doughter forsaken “þat in trouþe þow haddest taken? “Þat ys þe þank þat þou me cones! “I hope to wynne þat þou inne wones. “Y serued þy fader in many nede, “&amp; yuel ?eldest þou me my mede. “I auntred me in many chaunce “þy fader Brutus forto auaunce; “Many strok gaf in many stour “To brynge þy fader til his honur; “&amp; ?it þy self auaunce y wylde. “Bot for on þey calle Estrylde, “fforsake[st] my doughter Gwyndolene, “&amp; dost me despit &amp; tene! “Whil (þou wost) y am on lyue, “Schalt þou haue non oþer wyue! “þou bryngest þe in foul fame, “&amp; dost me gret onoy &amp; schame, “&amp; my doughter Gwendolyn!” &amp; leyde hand on Lokeryn, &amp; wolde han venged þer his tene, Nadde lordes schoten hem bytwene &amp; departed hem o twynne, And preied Cornyus forto blynne. Lokerinus desponsauit hic Gwendolenam. Þey conseilled sire Lokeryn: He ?ede &amp; wedded Gwyndolyn. Bot he forgat in none manere ffaire Estrilde þat was hym dere: In Londone he dide hure kepe Vnder erthe in a seler depe; Estrylde was longe þare, Seuen ?er &amp; somwhat mare. When Lokeryn schold til hire go, To dwelle wiþ hure a day or to, Vntil his wyf þen tolde he “þat he schold go in priuete, “&amp; stille make his sacrifise “Til his Godes þer wyþ his seruise; “ffor openly ne fel hit nought “To do þat seruise þat he had wrought.” So longe he pleyed wiþ Estrilde Þat scheo hadde a mayden childe: Sabren hit highte, as whit as glas, &amp; fairere þan þe moder was. Gwyndolene a child had þan, A sone þat highte Madan: Coryneus hadde hit to loke; When tyme was, set hit to boke. Whan þat Corineus was ded, Dame Gwyndolene he misbed; ffor hure fader dide him tene, He drof awey dame Gwyndolene, &amp; tok Estrild[e] til his quene As dame Gwyndolene had bene. Scheo sey no bettere myghte auaille, Scho gadered an ost in Cornewaylle; Tyl hure frendes scheo pleyned hyre; Ageyn Lokeryn þey gon hem atyre Wyþ gret host out of mesure. Vpon a water men calde Esture, In Dorsete-schire, þey mette, &amp; to bataille swyþe þey sette. þe kyng was slayn þer wiþ a schote, þe host destruyed ilk a crote; þe quen had þer þe heyer hand, Scheo dide seise al þe land, Scheo did þen take faire Estrilde, &amp; Sabrin þat was hure child, &amp; dide þem yn a water cast; ffor þeym þe name ys roted fast; Seuerne hit hight, for þe child Sabren, ffor þat child þat name we ken: Þat tyme þat þis chaunce fel, Lyuede þe prophete Samuel. Gwyndolene was þen stout, Scheo dide þe folk vntil hire lout: Ten ?er wiþ Lokeryn had scheo ben, &amp; siþen fiftene wynter, quen. When Madan couthe kepe his þyng, In hure lyue was he mad kyng. To Cornewaille sche turnede eft, To kepe þat hure fader left. Madan gat vpon his wyf Two sones þat ay lyued in strif; Malyn highte þe eldest broþer, Membrice men calde þat oþer. Madan regned fourty ?er, &amp; left his sones þat lond in wer. Þyse brethere were euere wrothe, ffor þe lond þey striuen boþe. Membrice for trewes to Malyn sent, In pes to holde a Parlement; Bot Membrice to treson drow, His broþer Malyn priuely he slow; Þorow slaughter &amp; þorow treson Membrice hadde þe region. Þys Membrice wax vnkynde, ffordede god men þat he myght fynde, Reften oþer land or lyf, Or forsok his wedded wyf, &amp; haunted synne of Sodome: Vnkyndely to bestes he com. Twenty ?er þen had he space, &amp; als he went in wode to chace, Many wolues alone he mette; Also þeues abouten hym þey set, Lym fro lym hym al to-rent; &amp; so Membrice to deþe went. Þen Saul regned in Iudea, And Eristeus in Lacudemonia. Ebrauk his sone was of age, Had þis lond in heritage. He was a ful noble knyght, A gret nauye he dide hym dight; He was þe first man of þys lond þat robbed by se oþer by sond. Wiþ Cornewaleys he stod to chaunce, Þey &amp; he robbed al ffraunce; Þey robbed tresor &amp; vitaille; Hom in to Bretaigne þen gan þey saille. When he hadde y-now tresour &amp; fe, In þe North he made a cite; Kaer Ebrak he calde þat toun; Anoþer, Aclud, vpon Brutoun. Kaer Ebrak first men spak, Syþen men caldyt Eborak; ffor frankysche speche ys nought so lyk, ffor Eborak þey caldit Euerwyk. Aclud he calde Maidenes toun, Carlauerok es now þe renoun; Maydeneskastel by þat day, Wiþ maydenes had he þer his play. Sexti wynter he regned lyues, &amp; twenty sones had by twenti wyues, &amp; þrytty doughtres by þe same. Of þyse children, lystneþ þer name: Nomina filiorum &amp; filiarum Regis Eboracy.

Belyn gaf nought of his manace, Bot þoughte he scholde ?it don him chace, &amp; sent hym bode by his men bolde, “Þat he had taken, þat wolde he holde; “ffor his praieres noþyng wolde do, “Ne for his loue namore þan so.” Hys folk were al redy &amp; dight Agaynes Brenne for to fyght: Bysyde a wode at Kalenters Mette þe breþere wyþ here baners; Eyþer oþer mykel þey hated, Þe felonloker þey hem abated; Dartes til oþer þey schotte ful faste, Grete stones wyþ slynges caste, Scharpe launces þorow scheldes smot, &amp; brighte swerdes þorow helmes bot; Sone by nekkes þey sesede sore Wyþ knyues smyten to deþ ay-whore, Þorow heued &amp; þrote, breste &amp; bak, ffruschte to-gidere, þat nekkes brak. Þe Bretons bolded styfly to stande, &amp; nought þe norþerne, bot were fleande; To flyght þey fledde, ilk bataille seer, &amp; Belyn folewede, &amp; neyghed hem ner; Two þousand fleyng he þer slow, Als þey vntil þer schipes drow. Brenne, þat made most þat wo, Wyþ peyne he skaped þe slaughtre fro; Vneþes he skaped, þe hauene he hent; His twelfte &amp; he, to se þey went; Alle he les bote þo twelue, To ffraunce he wente wyþ hem hym selue. ffyftene þousand slayn were told, Wyþoute prisoners þat were in hold. Whan al þis wo was brought til ende, &amp; Brenne in-til ffraunce gan wende, Belyn vntil ?ork he went, &amp; þere he held his parlement. He askede his barons, and spak, “What scholde be don of sire Guthlak?” Gutlak byforn sent to Belyn, Out of prison þer he lay yn, “Þat of Belyn he wolde holde “Al his honur, ?if þat he wolde, “Denmark his lond, quyt &amp; cler, “And gyuen hym truwage ilka ?er; “Syker þerof he wolde hym make, “Wyþ bond, &amp; god ostage to take; “Wyþy he myghte lede safly “His lemman, wyþouten vyleny.” Belyn had fol gret desyr To haue truwage of his enpir. Þorough leue of þe parlement, Gutlak &amp; his lemman went, When he had sworn &amp; don omage, &amp; bondes mad, &amp; gyuen hostage, To Belyn to halde þer couenaunt, fforto wende he hadde þe graunt. Gutlak, to go, sone he was ?are, Wyþ schip vntil his lond to fare. Belyn held wel þenne his honour, &amp; wysly was god governour; He louede pes wyþ al hys myght, &amp; pesyble men held he to ryght. Hys lond Bretayne he went þorow-out, &amp; ilka countre biheld about; Byheld þe wodes, watres, &amp; fen, &amp; no passage fond he mad for men, Ne heye strete þorow no contre, Neyþer to burgh ne to cyte. Þorow myres, hylles, &amp; vales, He made brugges &amp; causes, Heye stretes for comun passage, Brugges ouer watres dide he stage: Þe firste he made, he cald hyt “ffosse;” Þorow-out þys londe hit goþ til Scosse; Hit bygynnes atte Toteneys, &amp; endeþ þenne at Cateneys. An oþer strete þan ordeyned he: ffro Souþ-haumpto? opon þe se, To Mene yn Walys, (Seint Dauies now hight,) Ikenyldestrete reches ful ryght: Two causes ouer þe lond in lengþe &amp; brede, Þat men ouerthwert in passage ?ede. When þey were maked als he ches, He comaunded till alle haue pees; Alle schold haue pees &amp; fredam Þat in his stretes ?ede or cam; &amp; ?yf hit were any of hyse Þat for-dyde his ffraunchise, fforfeted schold ben al his þyng, &amp; hym self taken til þe kyng. Brenne þat was gon in to ffraunce, Hym schamed sore of his chaunce Þat hit was so wyde yspred Þat his lemman was a-wey led. Hym self &amp; his twelf felawes Serued þe kyng ?eres &amp; dawes; Knyght he was, curteys &amp; wys, Oueral he hadde los &amp; pris; What ony knyght hadde to þer lyuere, His was largest, for he was fre; Mykel was he preysed of prowesse, &amp; ful wel loued for his largesse; He couþe mykel of curtesy, &amp; faire hym bar, as man worþy. When his los was þorow ronnen, &amp; in þe lond his pris hadde wonnen, Wiþ wham he made any soiour, He preyed for help &amp; for socour ffor to conquere his heritage, Þat Belyn reftym wiþ outrage; &amp; ?ede to Burgoyne, to Duk Segwyn, Bysought hym of help ageyns Belyn. Þe Duk louede his compaignie, &amp; gaf hym of his tresorie. Brenne was yn speche curteys, &amp; konnynge knyght by many weys; He couþe of chas &amp; of ryuere, Inow of game of here manere; Gentil of body, wyþ fair visage, He semed a man of hey parage, &amp; was plesaunt &amp; seruisable. Þe Duk was riche wyþoute fable, &amp; of his body had non heyr Bot a mayde ferly feyr. Inough sche hadde þat tyme of elde, Þat scheo myght take a lord to welde; He spak louely, wysly, &amp; stille. &amp; serued þe Duk at al his wylle, &amp; wel hym payed alle his dedes, &amp; oueral wel he spedde his nedes. Þe Duk his doughter gaf hym to wyue, To haue þe Duche after his lyue. Þen þoughte þe Duk, þat hym fel feir Þat God had sent hym suche on til heyr. Brenne obeysed hym curteysly, &amp; seide “Sire Duk, graunt mercy!” Al men hym louede, &amp; held hym dere, Ech man hym payed wel his manere. ffel þanne wyþynne þe twelf-monþ ende, Swyche a grace God gan hym sende, Þat he deyde, þe Duk Segwyn. Of al þe Duche, Brenne tok seysyn; Hys barons þat louede hym wel byfore, After louede hym mykel more; Wel louede hym ilka Burgyloun, &amp; knyghtes of þeyr nacioun; He hadde þe lond wyþ al þe rente, And a ?ong lady fair &amp; gente. In al his welþe forgat he nought How Belyn hadde wyþ hym wrought, &amp; held þe londes þat his schold be; Bot whan he sey his tyme eyse, He sent for knyghtes &amp; squiers, ffrendes he soughte, &amp; waged souders; Wyþ gret ost cam til Normandie, &amp; purueyde þer a gret nauye. Whan hit was tyme, had wynd at wille He passed þe se wyþouten ylle. Belyn herde wel þat he cam; Wyþ folk ynogh ageyns hym nam; Þer bataylles assembled wyþynne a lite, &amp; redy were almost to fyghte. De Humilitate Tonewenne, matris Belyni &amp; Brenni. So com þeyr moder, dame Tonewenne, Þat bar boþe Belyn &amp; Brenne, Bytwyxt þer hostes, tremblyng for drede; ffol old scheo was, haltyng scheo ?ede; Ouer al scheo asked where was Brenne. Atte þe laste, men gan hure kenne; &amp; Brenne herd seye þat hit was sche; He saide “Moder, welcome be ?e!” Hure armes aboute his nekke sche cast,— Boþe ostes wondred þer-ate fast,— Vntil hure girdel hure cloþes sche rent; Naked byfore þe host sche went; Vntil Brenne gretynge sche spak, Hur fyngres sche wrast, þe blod out brak, Sche tremblede &amp; sykede inderly, Handes &amp; face brest al blody: “Dere child!” scheo seid, “wher hastow ben? “Now þanky God y haue þe sen! “Sone,” sche seide, “list now to me, “&amp; do als y schal conceille þe. “Lo, here þe pappes þat þou on sok! “Þyse armes hit arn þat þe bylok! “Here ys þe wombe ?e boþe ynne ware! “Þys body ?ow bar wiþ wo &amp; kare! “Y am sche þat for ?ow kneled! “Now þenk o þat sorwe þat y þenne feled! “Ley now no sorewe me more byforn, “ffor hym þat let ?ow of me be born! “Ley doun þyn armes, me forto saue! “Wylle nought þat y for þe deþ haue! “Þou mysdost, þat þou now fandes “To brynge straungers of outlandes “Vs forto robben &amp; to slo! “Rest þe! let þy mod ouer go! “Þou hast namo breþere in wold; “Þy fader ys ded, þy moder ys old; “Suffre, for no þyng in lyue, “Þy pore frendes a-way to dryue! “Þou scholdest vs presente &amp; gyue, “&amp; helpe vs alle in pes to lyue; “Bot now þou comest to reue vs our [socour], “Þat scholdest ben oure mayntenour. “Lef folye! &amp; y vndertake, “?yf þou on hym wilt pleynte make, “And y fynde he haue þe gylt, “He schal amenden right als þou wilt; “Bot ?yf þou seist he dide þe fle, “I seye nay; witnesse on þe! “ffyrst þou bygonne al yn wrong; “So al þe folye ys on þe longe, “Þe firste folye &amp; yuele dedes. “When þou intil Norwey ?edes, “Wyf to take, wyþouten leue, “Þat schewede þou mentest hym to greue, “&amp; broughtest Norn men hym tasaille: “Þerfore þou lostest þy bataille; “Þy blame ys now ?yt fol grym, “Þat swiche an host bryngest on hym “&amp; schapest oure desherytysoun, “&amp; þys londes destruccioun! “So mykel yuel wold he nought þe, “Al-þey his power so mykel myght be. “Brenne, sone! what þenkest þou? “Com til acord now for þy prow! “Ley doun þy swerd, do wey þy scheld, “Wyþdraw þy folk out of þe feld; “&amp; sek þe pes, for charite! “Þe same schal he do to þe.” Brenne hure preyere vnderstod; ffor loue of hure changed his mod; His helm, his hauberk, he dide vnlace; Al bar-heued, wyþ open face, Cam he wiþ his moder Tonewenne, &amp; also dide Belyn to Brenne: Þeyr moder dide hem to-gedere kysse. ffor þat saughtlyng was mykel blisse; More of wrath was þer nought spoken; ffor loue in armes ilk oþer þey loken. Al þus þen ended þe breþere wrathe, Þer tene turned to game &amp; glathe. ffro þeþen to Londone þey went, &amp; þer þey helde a parlement; Of þeyr parlement was þe ende, To wynne ffraunce wolde þey wende. Belyn dide somone his Bretons, &amp; Brenne haþ alle his Burgylons. By tyme &amp; terme þat þey had set, Boþe ostes atte hauene met, &amp; schiped ouer into ffraunce; To wynne hit, þey hoped was her chaunce. By-twyxt hem was þen a batille don: Þe force of ffraunce fel ful son, Þey durede nought to fighte in feld; Þe breþere dide hem to þeym ?eld; Casteles þey sesede fer &amp; ner, &amp; wonne alle ffraunce wyþynne a ?er. When al þe folk were atter dome, Þey seide þey wolde wende to Rome, And leue non þat þey fond, Bot ?yf þey helde of þeym þer lond. Þey sente aboute to diuerse costes, Of doughti folk þey gadered hostes ffor to wynne pris &amp; prow; Þey passed þe Mountaynes of Moungow; Taurynus þey toke, &amp; Iuerye, &amp; alle þe Cytes of Lombardye, Vrceles, Pauye, &amp; Tremoygne, Melan, Plesence, &amp; grete Boloyne; Þey passed þe water of Tauron, &amp; þe hul of Mount Bardon; þey robbed þorow al Tuskane, &amp; al ouer rod, &amp; þorow ran. Als þey ryfled landes ay whore, Rome þey neighed ay þe more. Romayns dredden hem for to deye, ffor þo tydynges þat þey herd seye; Al day of passande men þey herd, Þe two breþere wonnen al þe werd. Þey of Rome had chosen þat ?er Two noble men of gret power, Þat þey scholde, when þey had nede, Þer folk vntil bataille lede, &amp; saue þer landes, holde þem to ryght, ffor doughtiest þey were in fyght: Sire Procenna, þat on hight so, Þat oþer men calde sire Galbao; Þyse to were þeyr conseillours, &amp; speke vnto þe senatours “What þey wolde, how hadde þey tight, “Þeyr cite ?elde, or stande to fyght.” Þe Sene seide þey were affrayed, Non hem wyþstod, bot þorow alle strayed: “Wiþ swilk to fighte, we haue non host, “ffor þey han folk wyþ þe most; “&amp; ?yf we myghte oure pes haue, “Þorough mekenesse oure gode saue, “&amp; oure seluen at here pes lyue, “Gold &amp; seluer we wolde þem gyue. “Ouer þat, þey schul haue truage, “To passe &amp; do vs non vtrage; “ffor strong hit were for oure cite “To be destruyed, &amp; al þe contre.” In al þer drede, &amp; al þer dome, Þe breþere come &amp; byseget Rome. Þorow comun assent of þe senatours, Þey presented þe breþere gret tresours; &amp; to be in here auowery, Truage þey graunted hem for þy. Þe breþere tok of þem hostage; Twenty childre of þe beste lynage &amp; of þe richest of al þe toun, Þey presented hem as for raunson: Þus was þe pes bytwixt hem graunted, Bot lytel þrowe þey hit haunted. Belyn &amp; Brenne remued þer host, By Lombardye þey wente þe cost, To werren opon þe Alemauntz, &amp; take truage of þe remenauntz. Þey were letted by þe Romayns, Þat couenaunt breke; rise þeym a-geyns; &amp; proue þey wolde þeir hardinesse, And seide þey wolde do more pruesse. Þey send for knyghtes oueral aboute, &amp; gaderet ost gret &amp; stoute, Wel armed in ilke a conreye; After þe breþere þey tok þeir weye; On þem þey þowte to smyte al fresse, Ithe Mountaingnes to holdem at destresse, Þat non of hem scholde namore come Of þo breþere eft to Rome. Þey sente messages on þer partye, In to Alemayne, þe breþere to spie, Þat ilka pas þey scholde so wayte, Ithe Mountz holden hem so straite, ?yf þey schold passe on eyþer syde, Wyþ force þey schold hem ouer ryde. Al þus on ilk a side þey ros, To haue þe breþere host in clos; &amp; atter passyng in to þe mount, Þe Alemauntz schold ben in þer frount; Þorow force of þer god ordynaunce, Þey schold nought passe þorow no chaunce. When Belyn perseyued þe ffelonye, Þey conseilled on þer partie Þat Brenne scholde turne a-gayn To wyþstande þe host Romayn, And Belyn scholde on his side Agayns þe host of Alemauntz ryde; &amp; whilk of þem best myghte spede, Schold turne &amp; helpe þe toþer at nede. When Romayns wyste Bren schold come, Þey toke þe wey agayn to Rome, Þat Brenne schold neighe Rome no ner, &amp; þe breþere a sondre fer. Þorow a spye Belyn herde seye, &amp; taughte Brenne a geyner weye; To trauersen hem al ouer þere score, &amp; passe þe Romayns wel byfore. Þey chose gyours þe contre knew, To lede þem wye trist &amp; trew, &amp; brynge þem wel to þat strete Þer þeym byhoued Romayns mete. Þey iourneyed boþe dayes &amp; nyght Al so stille as þey myght, Wyþoute noise, cry, or how, Vntil þe entre of Moungow. &amp; when þey were in þe valeye, Þer ledere seide, “þys ys þeir weye! “By þys þey come, hit is certeyn; “Oþer wey haue þey non ageyn.” To þat passage þey come at nyght; Þe mone schon ful faire &amp; bright; Brenne bad þem ber ham [al] pryue, Wiþ-oute noyse, til tyme schold be. Sone after cam þe Romaynes route; Of non þey hadde drede ne doute. By þe mone þat so lyght schon, Þey spedde hem faste swythe to gon. Atte passage glyfte þey þer eyene; Agayns þe mone sawe þey schyne Helmes, hauberkes, scheldes vp-lyfte. Þenne were þe Romayns al a-glyfte: Þe Bretons hadde þe Romay[n]s byden; Al so swyþe þey to þem ryden; Brenne þem boldede, bad þem wel smyte, “ffelleþ ?our fos þat wolde ?ou byte!” Oueral þe Bretons þeym assailled; Þe Romayns route fel &amp; failled; Þey nadde no tome for to fle, Ne place to huyden hem priue. Þe Bretons bowaylled þeym, &amp; hew; In buskes, bankes, doun þeym þrew; Þe slaughtre lasted al þat nyght, Til hit sprang þe dayes lyght; &amp; al þat day afterward, Vntil þe nyght, was bataille hard. Þe nyght departed þem o sunder: Þat any askaped, hit was a wonder. Þat oþer day in þe morwen tyde, Toward Brenne, Belyn gan ryde;— ffer from his broþer wold he nought go, What chaunce so bytidde of mo;— &amp; Brenne þat byfore nam, Abod [þer] vntil Belyn cam. When þey were to-gyder comen, Boþe vntil Rome nomen, &amp; byseged hit aboute,— &amp; þey of Rome were ful stoute,— On alle sides þey sette engyns, Als Brenne ordeyned, &amp; belyns. Mynours þey hadde ynowe, &amp; sleye, Þe wal to perce &amp; vndermye. Þo wyþynne deffended hem wel, At þat tyme lostey nought a del; Wyþ arblastes schoten quarels vnryde, Inow men broughte, &amp; leide by syde; Wyþ grete stones þey hem affrayed. Þe Romayns were nought desmayed, Þey launced darte, bowes drowe, ffele þey felde, &amp; manye slowe. Þe breþere leften þer assaut al, &amp; persed no þyng of þe wal. Longe lastede þat ilk distaunce, To þe breþere gret noyaunce; Galewes dide þe breþere renge; Of þer blod þey wol þeym venge; Þe galewes þey reysed vp ful heye,— Þe Romayns wel myght hem se wyþ eye,— &amp; hongeden alle þer hostagers, Burgeyses sones, lordes peres. Þat kynde, y trowe, had sorewe &amp; wo, To schames deþ þat saw hem go. De Subuersione fratrum. Alle olyke þer fore were wroþ, &amp; alle seide, &amp; swore þer oþ, In pes ne schold þey passe quyt, Bot þey wer wroken on þat despit. On þyse men tristed þe Romayns þo, On Prosenna &amp; on sire Gabao, ffor þyse wer gon to Lumbardye To procure Rome more partye. After þeyn abyden þe Romayns; A day to come þey sette certayns; Þat day was ner of þer comyng, Þe Romayns þat day mad þer samnyng, &amp; ber hem ful egrely &amp; stout; Þey armede hem, &amp; isseden out, &amp; oþe breþere faste þey sought, &amp; þey ageyn ne spared hem nought. Als þey foughten best in stour, Com her chefteyns wyþ more socour; Oþe breþere þey fullen alle on a res: Þan were þey boþe in hard destres; Þe Romayns vpon þe oþer partz, Þat oþer side, Poyles &amp; Lombartz, &amp; felde fele of þe Burgoylons, &amp; calde þem “cowardz! hore sons! “We schol ?ow do drynke ?our owen blod, “&amp; spare oure water of Tyber flod! “On þys half Moungow, what do ?e, “Vs to chalange of vur fe? “&amp; þat ?e henge our children heye, “Þat vilenye ?e schulle abye! “To ?ow was hit an yuel conseil; “Þat schul ?e fele to wroþer hayl.” Wiþ suche vmbreides þey hem missayde, &amp; grete strokes vpon þeym leyde; Obak a-geyn [þey] dide þem go, &amp; dide þem braye &amp; crye for wo. Belyn &amp; Brenne were al dysmayed Þat þe Romayns so þem affrayed; Þe Bretons sawe þer syde ?ede lowe, Þey rempede þem to reste a þrowe; In þer restyng þey gan hem mene, A parlement made þem bitwene, &amp; gadered þer folk a-geyn to fyght, Armed hem newe, &amp; renged hem right, In sere batailles set þeym a sondres, Boþe by þousands &amp; by hundreds. Of þe hardiest &amp; defensables, Made þey Mayster Conestables, &amp; bad hem in þer bataille holde, Þat non fro oþer schold flitte ne folde. [beside were set to þer socoure, archers to maynten þam in stoure; þe alblasters on þe toþer side, ilkon for oþer better to bide. doun on fote þe moste gan light o? fote þei renged þam to fight.] Þo þat were strong, hardy, &amp; wyght, fformest þey were set to fyght; Þey bere þe launces vp and doun, On þe manere of a scheltroun; &amp; non for wele ne for wo Ne scholde byforen oþer go, Ne go swyþer þan softe paas, At ones to smyte, as comeþ þe cas; &amp; non schold baldere þan oþer be, Ne noman [schold] fro oþer fle. When þey had set ilk a bataille, On what manere þey schold assaille, Trompe blewe, &amp; greyles ronge, On boþe parties þer batailles sprong. On ilka side were strokes ynowe, Speres dide þem breste &amp; bowe; After þe speres þat þey set, Syþen wiþ swerd &amp; knyf þey met; Ilk oþer on ran ilk oþer to styke; Vpon þe dede ?ede þe quyke. Al to telle hit, nought y ne can, Bot loren was þer many a man; Þe Bretons seye non oþer weye, Þey most wel fyghte, oþer elles deye; Oþer al to wynne, or al to lese, Þat on of þo byhoued hem chese. Þe best fyghters ber forth þe brest, Archers &amp; arblasters þem next; Þe Myle[ne]rs &amp; þe Centaynes ffolewed faste on þo Romaynes; Sire Galbao, þer gouernour, He bated hym o þe Bretons stour; Bot slayn was sire Galbao, Þat al þer trist was vnto; &amp; Prosenna was brought right doun, On hem þe Bretons wonne þe toun; Prosenna þey tok a[l] quyk; Þey persed þe Romayns bataille þyk, &amp; al þer force doun þey slow, &amp; to þe cite faste þey drow. Þe toun might þey defende namore, Þe cheftayns were slayn þat þer wore; Þe breþere come vntil þe cite, &amp; founde þer-inne richesse plente. Belyn gaf Brenne al þe empyre, And he was Enperour &amp; sire; Þe folk of hym þey had gret doute, His fomen þorow force dide þem aloute, [Long he regned Emperoure] Þat neuere dirst Romayn stire in his stour. Belyn to Bretayne þen gan turne, He wold no lengere þer soiourne; &amp; when he com vntil þis lond, Þe olde cites þat he fond, He closed þem, &amp; mad hem newe, Þe walles he reisede trist &amp; trewe. In Walys he dide make a toun; Kaerusik he caldit on bretoun, ffor hit stande vpon Vsk, A water þat rennes by bank &amp; busk; Siþen men caldit Kaer-legion: List now what was þe enchesoun. Whylon Romayns had þis lond In þer demeynes, in þer hond; Whan Romayns com for þer truage, At Kaerusyk þey helde hostage, &amp; þere þey made most dwellynge, ffor þer was gret ese of mikel þyng; At Kaerusyk in Clamorkan, In wynter þey dwelt þer, ilkaman; &amp; for þey had so longe þer hold, Kaer-legion þe name was told. Com after, men of diuerse language, Þat schortly to speken haue in vsage, And schorted hit wyþ name &amp; soun, And afterward kaldyt Carlyon; Bot legion ys noumbre of folk þat wex, Sex þousand, sex hundred, sexti &amp; sex; Þus many alwey fro Rome com, Þat ay for truwage to Carlyon nom. Whan Belyn Carlion had set, Þe walles he reysed, &amp; folk to fet; To Londone þenne tok he þe way, And þer he dwelled many a day. Þer dide he a gate by-gynne, Ouer þe water, þer schipes come ynne; &amp; ouer þat gate he made a tour, Þer-inne he held [ful] long soiour. He reysed alle his fader lawes, &amp; dide þem holde by his dawes; Dom he gaf wysly &amp; right, Trowþ held he wel wiþ al his myght. Mykel pleynte was in his tyme, On no mannes more may men ryme; Longe he lyuede, longe to welde, &amp; faire he ended in his elde; ffor of þat gate þat Belyn aught, Of Belyn [þen] þe name hit laught; Longe men caldit til now late, After Belyn, Belynes gate; Þorow schort langage, y tolde er how Byllyngesgate men calle hit now. Hic moriebatur nobilus Belynus. Whan he was ded, sire Belyn, Þe people for hym hadde sorwe &amp; pyn; ffor manye a man fol sore gret Þat day þat he ys lyf for-let. Þey dide make for his honur A barel of gold of his tresour, &amp; brente his body, flesche &amp; bon, Iþe barel of gold þey leid ilkon; More worschip þem þought hit so, Þan his body in erthe to do. When þe barel was al dight, &amp; wel y-burnuscht fair &amp; bryght, Vp yþe Tour þey made a stage, &amp; heye it henge bifore þe passage, Þat alle þat passed, more &amp; lasse, Schold preyse Belyn for his prowesse. Gurgoynt Rex. After Belyn, Gurgoint his sone Hadde þe heritage þorow resone. Gurgoynt Beretruk, þus was his name; Of gret godnesse he bar þe fame; Pes to loke, &amp; ryght to holde, He lyknede his ffader, Belyn þe bolde. Þat Belyn left, he heldit wel; Noiaunce had he neuere a del, Bot þe Daneys, þey forsok To gyue truage þat Belyn tok. Gurgoynt þoughte he hadde ryght þer-ynne, His truwage he wolde al gate wynne; His host he gadered, &amp; schipes did come; Þey set vp sail, &amp; forþ þey nome. To bataille þey samnde, boþe partys, Bot Gurgoynt wan þer sone þe pris; Hym self yn bataille slow þe kynge, &amp; tok homage of ilka lordynge; &amp; his truwage dide restore, Als his fader had hit byfore. When he had take of hem ostage, Gurgoynt forþ went on his viage: He passed forþ by Orkeneye; Þritty schipes he mette in weye, Charged wyþ folk &amp; wyþ vitaille, Bot þey ne wyste whider to saille; Pantalius, þer maister hight, Þat mayntende hem, &amp; held to ryght. Gurgoynt asked what men þey were, &amp; what þey soughte, &amp; why come þere. Pantalius spak ful curteysly. “We ar men of pes, sekyng auowery, “Wey-farende men þat wolde haue gryþ; “We aske þe leue to speke þe wyþ.” Þe kyng ne wolde no pes breke, Wyþ loue he gaf hem leue to speke. He saide, “We ar men of diuerse lynage, “Exiled of Spayne, comen by þys ryuage, “?yf þat we any stede fond, “On to reste, a certeyn lond. “ffor oþer half ?er þus haue we went; “Hunger, þurst, cold, haþ vs schent; “Many a cost haue we þorow sought; “Lond on to lende, ne fond we nought; “&amp; we ar alle onoyed þer fore, “ffor oure trauaille &amp; grete lore. “Bot, lord, ?yf hit were ?our wylle, “Suffre vs to reste on þy londe stille! “Seruise þer fore we wole þe do; “Þy men bycome, ?yf þou wilt so.” Bot Gorgoynt wolde þem nought graunt Of his to haue a remenaunt; Nought for þy he gaf hem conseil Toward Irlond to sette þer sayl; &amp; of his schipes he lente þem tweye, To techen hem þe ryghte weye.— Irlond þat tyme was bygged no þynge Wyþ hous ne toun, ne man wonynge.— So longe þey sailled, þe se þorow ronne, Þat algate to Irlond þey wonne; Þey stryken sayl, &amp; anker cast, Vp to lande þey ?ede ryght fast; Al þey founde wast &amp; wylde. Þey spredde hem aboute in ilkan ylde; Sone þey maden eryed feld, Þey logged hem, &amp; tymber teld; Þer folk wax faste, &amp; fostred more, &amp; tyled þe lond aboute ay whore. Pantalyus primus Rex Hibernie. Pantalius, þey maden hym kyng; In Irlond þen made he first wonyng. When Gurgoynt had þem þider ysent, Hom vntil his lond he went; Þritty ?er in þys lyf gan lende; At Kerlyoun he made hys ende. Gwyntelyn Rex, cuius vxor Marciena Sapiens fuit. Whan Gurgoynt hadde don his fyn, Regned his sone Gwyntelyn; A god man was for þe maystrie, &amp; his wyf highte dame Marcye. Dame Marcye was mikel of pris; Of landes lawe scheo was ful wys; Scheo studyed faste to make þe lawe. ffor hure þey caldyt by þat dawe, In Bretons tyme, als y wene, Þey calde þat lawe Marcyene. ffro kyng to kyng þat lawe men wrot, &amp; Englysche kynges ?it hit wot; Marchenlage, þe Englisch hit calde; In eyghte schires þat lawe ?it men halde, Gloucestre, Chestre, Warewyk, Oxenford, Hereforde, Wynchestre, Schropschire, Stafford. And Gwyntelyn &amp; Marcyen, A knaue child hadden þem bytwen. Syluyus Rex. Syluius his name þey told, &amp; er he were seuen ?er old, Deyde his fader: þat tyme here He regned namore bot ten ?ere. After Gwyntelyns deces, Kepte Marcyen þe lond yn pes; &amp; when þat he was wel of elde, Þat he couþe þe londes welde, Scheo hym dide coroune kynge;— Y telde ?ow his regne in alle þynge;— Stalworth he was, yn armes bone; Bot after his fader he deyde sone. Kynmar Rex. Þenne com his heir, Kynmar, her, &amp; regned on &amp; twenty ?er. Daneus his broþer þen hadde þe lond; Rex. Ten ?er he regned, wyþ werre he fond. De Morpydeo Rege Bastardo. Þys Daneus hadde on bastardie A sone þat wan hit wyþ maistrie; Morpydus, hit seys he hight; He was a merueillous mody knyght. Þorow hardynesse wan hit of chaunce; Egreliche he tok vengeaunce, Hys ire, when hit on hym ran, ffor nought wold he slo no man; ffor loue wold he noman spare, Þe whyles þat his wrathe ware. In al þe regne ne was þer non So fair of vertues als he on. Hys body was gent, &amp; fair of vis; Til alle he gaf gyftes of pris; Out of mesure þen was he large, Tresour to holde ne made he charge. Þe while his ire was a-weye, Al wold he do þat men wold seye, &amp; also meke was as a child, Tyl þat his wraþ wax on hym wyld. In Morpidus tyme þat was so stout, Þe duk of Morreue robbed a-bout; Northumberland gan he waste; &amp; Morpydus til hym gan haste, And angerly gan hym assaille, &amp; þer hym slow in pleyn bataille. Þus seide men, &amp; ?it mes seys, Þat hit was proued (y not what weys) Þat Morpidus slow mo men, alone, Þan alle his host[e] dide ilkone. When he had slayn al þat he myght, &amp; was al wery more to fyght, Þe bodies he dide brenne of þo, Er his grete ire myght ouer go. Þe tyme þat he was best in elde, &amp; stalwordest hym self to welde, A best com out of þe Irysche se &amp; destruyed al þe contre; An hydous best was hit by sight, ‘Monstre Maryne’ men seide hit hight; &amp; som men caldit ‘Marebellew,’ So wonderful best no man þer knew. (Swylk calle men ‘Monstre,’ als y fynde, Þat lymes hauen out of kynde; Þat hauen lymes more or lesse, ‘Monstre’ men seis þat swilkon ysse.) ‘Marebellow’ ys þe se hound: I not wheþer hit suiymmes or is atte ground. Was non þat wonede by þe se syde, Þat durste for þat best abyde; Man &amp; best he swelwed &amp; et; Þat he ouertok, on lyue ne let. Morpidus herde þerof gret cry; Hys herte was bold &amp; euere hardy, On himself he affyed so, Allone, þe best he ?ede hym to, &amp; faught wyþ hym,—hit was folye On hym self so mykel forto affie;— Hym self alone þe best assailled, Gret hardynesse hym non ne failled; Wyþ spere first he til hym schet; &amp; wounded hym þat was so gret. Whan he had schoten, &amp; til hym cast, Þenne wyþ swerd hew on hym fast. Ouer neygh he cam in þat fyghtyng: He gaped wyde, &amp; swelwed þe kyng. [þus gate deid sir Morpidus; So did þe best þat swalud him thus.] ffor þe kyng men made gret mone, Þe bestes deþ conforted ilkone. Gorbodyan rex. Morpydus hadde sones fyue, &amp; alle þey leftym byhinde alyue. Gorbodyan, fairest of flour, &amp; Argayl, &amp; sire Elydour, Iugenes, &amp; sire Perodour, Alle fyue were kynges of honur. Gorbodian was flour &amp; pris, He was trewe, feyghtful, &amp; wys; Neuere kyng wyþ so mykel loue Ouer no lond regned aboue, Neuere louede he no lye, No dide men wrong, lowe ne heye. He was kyng ful mesurable, To don alle right he was ful stable; Loue &amp; pes his tyme was ryf; Ten ?er he lyuede þer inne his lyf. In Trenouante þer he lys, His broþer hym leyde at his deuis. Argayl Rex. Argayl, þat next hym was born, Was kyng as he had be byforn. Wykkedly þen gan hym falle, ffor he discorded wyþ hem alle; Þe godmen he abesed mykel, &amp; auaunsed þo þat were swykel; Þe tresor þey hadden, he it hem reft; He loued wel lyes; þe soþes he left; Trowe men ne louede he nought; Glad was he whan wo was wrought. þe barons conseilled þeym bytwene; Þe lond þey refte hym quyt &amp; clene. Elydourus Rex. Þenne corouned þey sire Elydour, Man of pite &amp; of socour. Argail, þat was dryuen out, He ?ede to prynces ouer al about ffor help to haue his regne ageyn; Bot his trauaille was al in veyn, Non wolde helpe restore his perd; Þen lyued he ffyue þer in pouert. Sone afte[r] þe ffyue ?eres ende, Elydour þorow a wode schold wende, ffor to pleye by o ryuer; Þat wode, men caldit Calduter. Argail þer sire Elydour mette; On knes sire Elydour he grette, &amp; asked hym grace &amp; mercy; &amp; he hym graunted al redy; On hym he hadde gret pyte, Þat in pouerte schold hym se. His armes abute his nekke he kast, His grete pouerte he pleyned fast; Whan he had longe ment his mone, Tyl Aclud þey wente ilkone; In his chaumbre he dide hym be, Þat non hym wiste bot in pryuete. Hereþ now of sire Elydour, How he dide his broþer gret honur. De pietate Elydory. Elydour feyned hym sik to lye, &amp; seide he hopede forto deye. After his barons þenne he sent, And þey alle til hym went; A day was ordeyned for to be, Þat þey schold visiten hym, &amp; se; Wyþoute noyse til hym schold go, On alone, wyþouten mo, &amp; speke softe &amp; priuely, ffor he ne moughte suffre no cri. Ilkon dide þe kynges wille, As þey come yn, þey held hem stille; &amp; als þey comen, þe kyng hem tok, &amp; dide þem sweren on þe bok ffor to don Argail homage; Were he neuere of so hey parage, Wold he, ne wolde, þat scholde he do, Oþer þe deþ schold he go to. Þus sonderlypes he dide þem swere, Tyl Argayl schulde þey faiþ bere. Deposito Elidoro, Argayl iterum factus est Rex. When þey had alle sworen an oþ Tyl Argail, wer hem lef or loþ, Elydour &amp; þey alle went To ?ork, &amp; helde a Parlement. Elydour þer þe coroune leued, And set hit vpon Argailes heued, &amp; seide, “here gyue y þe Argayl “Þe coroune of Bretayne holyke al.” Þan seide men of sire Elydour, Þat he of pite was fruyt &amp; flour, Þat forsok þe regalte, &amp; gaf hit his broþer for pite; þerfore in ilka lordes hous Was he cald Elydour Pytous. Argail amended his maners, &amp; louede his barons, &amp; m[a]de þem pers; Was non of hem so mesurable, Ne of his word so wys &amp; stable; Alle his wykked tecches he left When [he] had take þe corown eft; Alle hym louede þat hym er hated, ffor alle his vices were abated. Ten ?er he regned in honour, &amp; syþen fel in a langour, &amp; ended his lif fair &amp; wel: Þey byried hym at Karlel. Iterum elegerunt Elyodorum. Sire Eliadour eft þey ches, Þat loued so mikel pite &amp; pes. Bot Iugens &amp; Perodours Agayn hym gonne be werreours; Pryuely gadered þey partye, &amp; tok hym al wyþ tricherie; At Londone þey dide hym in hold, In a prison hard &amp; cold. De falsitate fratrum. Perodour &amp; Iugenes, Þey parted al þis lond, &amp; ches: Iugenes tok, as hym þought best, By northen Humber, Est &amp; West. Perodour hadde þat oþer partie, &amp; in a þrowe al þe seignurye; ffor Iugenes lyued bot seuen ?er, Wythouten heyr, quyt &amp; cler. Perodour gan hit þenne vnderfonge; Rex. Bot he reioysed hit nought longe, ffor þe ffeuerynges deþ hym tok; Wyþ synne hit wan, wiþ sorewe hit fursok. Þen brought þey forthe sire Elydour, Rex. &amp; corouned hym wyþ honur. When he had take þe coroun, He dide þat tyme þe folk somoun To se þe skaþes his breþere had don, &amp; amended hem al so son. Of folyes was he god iustice, He refte nere man his fraunchise; He gaf ensample of alle wysdam, Þat helden þe lond, or after hym cam; Large of herte, of wylle fre, He hight Elydour of pyte; In al his tyme hit was hende, In alle godnesse his lyf gan ende; In Aldeburghe castel was he leyd, ‘Klud’ þat tyme þe name was seyd. After Elydour of pite, His cosyn hadde þe regalte, Þe eldest sone of Gorbodian, Rex. Syþen Argailes sone, þat hight Morgan. Rex. Þys Morgan was god &amp; meke, His gode wyl was nought to seke; He was god lord wyþouten ylle, And alle hym louede wyþ gode wylle. After Morgan, Argailles sone, Ermaneus hadde þe regyone. Rex. Eumaneus was Morganes broþer, Bot his maners were alle oþer, He couþe hym neuere ffrendes gete; Tyl al he hadde ire &amp; hate, &amp; alle hated hym right sore, ffor he dide ylle to alle þat wore; Ilkon þey found hym vengaunce ful, Wyþ schrewes he dide hem many yl pul. Six wynter he regned in his lyf, In felonye &amp; in stryf: Alle þe comune seide right þus, “We haten hym, so doþ he vs.” Þer-opon conseillede þey, &amp; dryue hym out of þe lond awey; Þus þey reftym þe kynedam, &amp; noman wyste whe[re] he bycam. Þenne made þey a parlement, &amp; chosen a kyng þorow alle assent, [þe comon of þe region] Iugeneus sone, sire Yualon. Rex. Yualon gaf hym to trauaille, Al to gode þat myghte auaille; He dide make many estres, And lykned muche his gode auncestres; Bot his lyf lasted no stounde, Ouer sone had deþ cast hym to grounde. When Yualo had mad his endyng, Perodours his sone þey chose kyng. Rex. After Perodours sone deces, Was Elydours sone Gerunces; Rex. After Gerunces was Catillus; Rex. After Catillus was Coyllus; Rex. Þenne was Porrex; &amp; þenne Cheryn, Reges. He þat was a drynkere of wyn; Ouer mykel drynke he ches; Hys ?oughte al þer-inne he les, In drynke &amp; in dronkenesse, Dide he neuere oþer prowesse. By his wyf had he þre sones, &amp; alle were kynges (þe story mones) Ilkon were after oþer: ffulgenius was þe eldest broþer; Rex. Eldadus, &amp; Androcheus, Reges. Þis oþer breþere men caldem þus; Lytel while was ilkon kyng, Alle made þey sone þer endyng. Androcheus sone highte Vryan, Rex. He regned a ?er, &amp; deide þan, After Vrian, Elyud men ches; Rex. He hadde his tyme þe lond yn pes. After Elyud, Endacius; Rex. After þan, Doten; syþen Gurguttus; Reges. Syþen was Merian, fayr in chere, Rex. He couþe of wode &amp; of ryuere; In alle manere venurye, Hym lyked best swylke maystrie. Ladies bed hym of loue ynow, Bot to non of hem wolde his loue bow, Bot onlyke til his owen wyf; So ended Merian his lyf. After Meryan was Bleludo Rex. His sone, &amp; couthe of wode also; Large he was, &amp; gaf bleþely, He spared to non þat was worþy; Alle men hym loued, for he was fre, Erl, baron, &amp; knyght, &amp; oþer meyne. After þys noble Bleludo Cam Capes,—hys name was so;— Rex. After Capes, Oeneus; Rex. After Oeneus cam Sysillius; Rex. After Sysilly com Glegabret, Rex. A syngere of þe beste get; Of song &amp; of mynstrecye Alle men gaf hym þe maystrie; Þe note he couþe of alle layes, Of mynstrecye al þer assayes; He couþe so mykel musyk &amp; thume Þat þe people [saide] in his tyme He was þe best of ffythelers, Of iogelours &amp; of sangesters, ffor he was euere glad &amp; gamen, ffele in seruise held he samen. Of ioye &amp; song was his spel; Was he neyþer irous ne fel, Bot led his lyf in melodye Ynto þe tyme þat he schold deye. After hym was Archyuaul, Rex. Pesable he was,—God haue ys saul!— After hym was his sone Eldol; Rex. Hit seys he hadde a folted pol, ffor he was euere lecherous, Of women ouer coueytous. A gentil womman, where he myght fynde, Were scheo neuere so noble of kynde, Wheþer scheo were wedded or nought, His lecherie he wolde haue y-wrought; &amp; for þencheson of his folye, Men hated hym, as was worthie. After Eldolf, þys folted fon, Cam his sone hight Redyon. Rex. Redyon hadde þe kynedam, &amp; after Redyon, Redryk cam; Rex. Syþen was ffamour, &amp; kyng Myssel; Reges. And after hym com kyng Pyrchel: Rex. Pyrchel had fair heued wiþ her, Þorow gift of kynde þat was er; Som what was hit fair out of kynde, Þat ?ut of his her write men fynde. After hym cam Caporus; Rex. Syþen, his sone Elignellus. Rex. Þys Elygnellus, fol wys was he, Man of mesure wel auyse; After hym regned his sone Ely Rex. ffully to-gidere ?eres fourty; A noble man was he, &amp; a wys; ffaire he deyd, &amp; at Castre lys. Lud Rex. Helye had þre sones wyghte: Þe eldest sone, Lud he highte; Þat oþer was Cassibalan; Þe þrydde, Nemny, a doughti man. Lud was eldest, most of age, Hym fel to haue þe heritage; Knyght was he fol god in stour, &amp; lyberal man, &amp; vyaundour; Cites &amp; casteles newe dide set; Of þe olde mad he god recet; He louede Londo? best of alle, Þerfore vmb-closedit wyþ a walle; Manye ar þe clos me se ?it stande, Þat Lud dude make, hym lyuande. ffor barons &amp; for burgeys sake, Grete stedes til hem dide he make; Þerfore men seye, &amp; ?it men may, Þat neuere bifore vnto þat day Made kyng byforn so fele cites, Ne castels, ne clos, þat ?ut men ses. Tyl Luddes tyme men held þat haunt, To calle London Trenouant; ffor þe loue of Lud ylk del, Þat woned þer longe, &amp; closed hit wel, &amp; was of hym so gret renoun; Kaer Lud þer fore men calde þe toun. Þenne come oþere men were straunge; ffor þe Lud, London dide hit chaunge, Þenne come Saxoyns, men of Angle, Als þey couþe on þer speche iangle, ffor Kaer-lud caldyt Ludden, Þat couþe þey best com on &amp; ken; Þenne come þe Normaunz &amp; þe Frankisch, Couþe nought com on to calle hit þis; ffor London, Londres þey hit calde; ?it Frensche men þat name halde. ffor regnynge of kynges straunge, ffor diuerse speche, langage men chaunge, Þat han þis lond often ywonnen, &amp; þorow riden &amp; þorow ronnen, &amp; þe names chaunget þer fore; Som names ar lasse, &amp; som ar more; I hope fo tounes þat now are Hold þer names þat first ware. When sire Lud, þe gode kyng, Was ded, &amp; don was his endynge, Byside his gate þey hym leyd, Þat, for his name, Ludgate ys seyd: He yt made, &amp; he yt aughte, Lodgate for hym þe name laughte. Of Lud were left two childre ?yng; Lond to kepe couþe þey no þyng: Þe eldest hight Androcheus, Þat oþer men calde Tenuacius. Cassibolon was þer em, Þe nexte sibbe of þat tem, He kepte þe childre &amp; þat lond; Men held hym kyng, faire he þem fond; He mayntende þe lond to ryght, He was curteys &amp; doughty knyght; Þe folke he couþe wel iustise, Of hem he hadde fair seruise. When þe childre were of elde Þat þey couþe lordschip welde, In to erldomes he dide þem seyse, Worschipfoly, al atter ayse. Androcheus hadde, þorow assent, Londoñ, &amp; þe erldom of Kent; Þat oþer broþer had þe baylle Of þe erldom of Cornewaille. When ilk was sesed in his erldam, Þey were cald Erles, whare þey cam. To whyle þe kyng &amp; his cosyns In loue loken ar þer lynes, Richesse þey hadde ynow to wylle, &amp; of no lond dredde þey non ylle, Ne neuere þurt hem haue drad no tyde. Bot ouerwenyng of herte pride Ros a discord hem bytwene, Þat longe in þys londe was sene; ffour hundred ?er hit lasted, &amp; nyne, In þis lond þat firste pyne; Hit bigan, as ?e may se, Of Cassibolon &amp; Androche, Þorow whilk sorewe þe Romayns wan Truage of Cassibolan, Þat myghte nere be wonne byforn, Tyl þer loue þorow pride was lorn; Whyle þer loue to-gedere held, Might neuere no Romayn bide þem in feld, Þat þey ne chased, þorow force of fight, Cesar of Rome, &amp; al his myght. How hit bygan bytwyxt þem bale, Listeþ, &amp; y schal rede þe tale. Exe de Iulio Cesare, Romanorum Inperatore. In þe tyme of Gassybolan, Iulius Cesar, a myghty man, Þat tyme was Emperour of Rome. Of alle knyghtes he bar þe blome, Of alle þo þat men of herd, ffor he conquered al þe werd; Als he was doughti knygt, &amp; god, In clergie wel he hym vnderstod, Of conseil he was man ful wys, &amp; of manhod he bar þe pris; Hys gyftes he gaf largely, He wyste to wham hit was worthi; ffals &amp; felon he couþe wel knowe; Þe ouer proude, he held þem lowe. Þe Romayns were þan of pride, ffor þey hadde wonne on ilka side; Þe londes oueral þem aboute, &amp; gauen þeym truage for doute. When Iulyus had wonne þus þere, ffurþer he þoughte to conquere; Long nold he soiourne ne rest, Tyl he had wonnen toward þe west. Hardy Iulius, knyght war &amp; wys, Preysed of prowesse, of poer had pris; He gadered hym of knyghte ?onge, Of alle nacions þat speke wyþ tonge, &amp; tok his leue at [þe] Romayns, To wende fro þem for longe teymes; West, he seide he wolde wende, To wynnen to þe wordles ende. Whan Iulyus was wel dight ynow, He passed Burgoyne &amp; Moungow. ffyrst he wan al Burgoyne, ffraunce, Nawuarre, &amp; Gascoigne, Peytowe, Normandye, þe lesse Bretayne; Syþen went agayn til Alemayne; Alle he wan hit ar he þeþen nam, Siþen to Boloyne &amp; to fflaundres he cam, &amp; al conquered vnto þe se, Al gaf truage to Rome in fe. Whan al was wonne, wel heldyn payd, By þe se a day he ?ede &amp; playd; Toward þe se his eye gan kest, &amp; faste byheld toward þe west: “What ys ?one lond y ?onder se, “&amp; what [folk] euere þer may be?” Men hym tolde hit was a lond þat folk of Troye first[e] fond; Brutus highte þer firste cheftayn, &amp; after hym hit hatte Bretayn; þe heires þat of hym ar comen, In heritage þey haue hit nomen. Dicta Iulii Inperatoris. Iulyus answered &amp; seide right þus: “Wel han y herd of sire Brutus; “He saide he com of Eneas kynde, “Bot ryghtly born nought we fynde; “He com of Eneas, þat held þo landes “Þer Rome our cite now yn standes; “?yf he were born of Eneas kyn, “Þorow kynde y sette chalange þer yn; “Chalange y wole þat lond þorow ryght, “Þat Eneas kynde gete þorow myght. “Ys þat lond — loke ?e me kenne— “Þat bolde Belym was of, &amp; Brenne, “Þat oure cite of Rome wan, “Oure se[n]e, &amp; destruyed ilkaman? “Wel schal þey wite, whyle y am her, “Þat Rome ys now of more power! “&amp; right hit were, &amp; reson hit welde, “Þat þey til vs truage schold ?elde: “?one ilde was Belynes, &amp; Rome was his; “Gret skil haue y þenne þorow þys, “ffor to sette chalange þer-inne, “Þat his lond was, þorow right to wynne. “By letteres woly hem first somoune, “To here þer wyl, what þey respoune; “Nought ne woly passe þe se “Til y wyte how þey answere me. “?yf þey to my pes wille hem chese, “&amp; ?eld hit me, þey schol nought lese; “?yf þey ne wol nought bot wyþ stour, “y dereyne þe lond for our.” Þay dide Iulyus write a bref, &amp; schewed hem how he was chef, &amp; how his kynde fyrst hit wan: Of Eneas com Brutus, þat man, &amp; syþen was Belynes heritage; He wold hit wynnen, or take truage. Þe lettere com to Cassibolan, Þat he schold bycome sire Iulyus man. Cassibolan brak þe seal o sunder; Of truage askyng he had wonder; Anoþer lettere dede he wryte þare, &amp; sent hit ageyn vntil Cesar Al in ire &amp; in tene, &amp; þe lettere þus mykel wol mene: Rescripcio Cassibolany ad Inperatorem. “Cesar,” he saide, “we haue meruaille “&amp; gret desdeyn, wyþouten faille, “Þat of ?ow Romayns rennes silk los,— “&amp; to longe hit lastes after hit gos,— “Þat ar of so gret couetyse “Þat non bot ?e may haue fraunchise; “And al þe syluer &amp; al þe gold, “&amp; alle lynage þat lyuen on mold, “Til ?oure dom wil ?e þem drawe; “Wy[þ]oute reson, wyþoute lawe, “Al þe tresor ?e drawe ?ow to: “What wil ?e þer-wyþ al do? “&amp; we þat are atte wor[l]des ende, “&amp; in an ylde lyue &amp; lende, “?yt ?e ne wil passe vs forby “Wyþoute truage askyng greuously! “&amp; we þat schal &amp; ben ?our peres, “?it wolde ?e make vs truagers! “Þerfore, Iulius, ?yf þou wilt assay, “&amp; of þy comynge sette vs a day, “Y trowe þou schalt fol euele spede. “Com on, &amp; proue hit in dede! “ffor euere ?it haue we lyued fre “Y þis lond, bot now for þe, “&amp; schul we lyue als frely “As ?e Romayns; &amp; reson whi: “Syn we ar comen alle of o kynde, “&amp; of o rote &amp; of o rynde, “Þat ys to seyn, of Eneas, “As frely born as euere þou was. “Þerfore, ?yf þou þe byþoughtest “In skil &amp; reson as þou oughtest, “Þou scholde nought put vs to seruage, “Syn we ben of þyn owen lynage; “We schul be peres to ?ow of Rome, “In alle fredam haue euenly dome. “Vs wondreþ at ?owre nurture of pris, “Þat swylke vilenie in þe now lys, “In seruage to put vs to! “&amp; we wot nought how we scholde do, “We neuere lered, ne nought wil lere, “?yf þat we may, in none manere. “Of alle oure kynde, y ne wyste no man “Þat couþe of seruage, ne ?ut ne can; “Ne we knowe nought on what wyse “We scholde serue seruage seruise. “ffre we ar, so schol we be; “&amp; ?yf God wyl, we schul for þe! “Wite þou wel by oure answe[re], “While we may oure seluen were, “&amp; fende oure lond &amp; oure fraunchise, “Of vs getestow neuere seruise! “Ne neuere truage schol we þe gyue; “Þat ys to seye, whiles þat we lyue, “We wol be fre, &amp; holde honurs, “As dide byforn our auncessours.” To Iulius swylk a lettere þey sent; &amp; when Iulius wiste þat entent, Þat ?if he wold haue any truage, Nede byhoued hym make passage, Þenne dide he make schipes &amp; barges, ffoure score wyþ grete charges,— So grete byfore were neuere for were, Ne non þat so gret charge myght bere,— Wyþouten oþer schipes smale, Þat we nought telde byforn in tale. De nauigio Cesaris. When Iulius Cesar was al redy, To go to schipe þey made a cry; His folk com in-to schipe right fast, &amp; drowe þer saylles vp heye on mast; Þen blew þe wynd, and gan hem dryue, At an heuen þey gon vp aryue, Þer Temese &amp; þe se to-gydere comen. Bot er Cesar hadde vp lond ynomen, Þer was sprad by þe se side ffair folk to fighte, Cesar tabyde: Cassibola[n] was redy at Douere, &amp; renged his men by þe ouere; Hys styward highte sire Belyn, Of conseil was he god &amp; fyn; He hadde do comen þorow somons On alle half, erles &amp; barons. Þe kynges neuews com wyþ gret partie,— To hem he myghte hym well affye,— Þe eldest highte Androcheus, Þat oþer broþer Temuacius; Androcheus &amp; his Loundreneys, Tenuacius wiþ his Cornwaleys, Sire Nemnius, sire of Kanterbire, Þe noblest of al þe empire: Þe kynges broþer was Sire Nemny, Androcheus was in his compaigny, &amp; oþer folk [ful] gret plente. Wyþ ostes were þer kynges þre: Erudyonus, þere Scottes kynge, Britalles wyþ al þe Walsche garderynge; Of South Walys com kyng Ignarcet; Þyse þre were in [o] bataille set, Wyþ here frewille þyse þre cam ffor to defende þe[r] fredam. Ilkon gaf conseil to go Er þe Romayns were logged mo; Bellum inter Romanos &amp; Cassibolanum. Er þey hadde ony recet taken, Þey þoughte þey wolde hem a-wake[n]. When alle were set in ylka bataille, &amp; schept ho scholde formest assaille, Toward þe Romayns faste þey nomen. Whan Cesar sey þat þey scholde comen, He cried to hys men “armes ?ow! “Þe Bretons ar redy, &amp; come right now.” Sone were þer bataille to-gedere met, &amp; to bataille renget &amp; set: [Þe parties smert smyten togidre, With scharp suerdes o? helmes gan glidre. þer schaftes þorgh schoten body &amp; schelde; Many on fell, &amp; many vphelde; Many tome sadill &amp; hors ostray, Many douhti knyght doun þer lay;] Many on wounded lay þer to blede, &amp; manyon stode, som fledde for drede; Knyghte iustede, archers drowe, On þoþe parties fol manie þey slowe, Þei come so þikke &amp; so smert, &amp; perced brunyes, brest &amp; hert; Wyþ wyfles strike, wyþ axes hewe, Schuldres, schankes, &amp; hedes, doun hewe; Alle was strewed þe grene gras Wyþ blod &amp; bowaille &amp; heuedes fresch. fful hard was þer, &amp; moste nede; Þe quiyke vpon þe dede ?ede; Vpon þe dede þey stode to fight, &amp; eueryche slow þat he slo myght. Cesar hadde in his bataille Knyghte þat couþe boþe fende &amp; saille; He peyned hym to do þeym wo, &amp; faste he folewede hem for to slo; Was þer no man þat he smot, Þat ful sore on hym ne bot; Mighte þer noman lyue no stounde, Þat of his swerd[e] laughte wounde. Androcheus com wyþ þo of Kent, &amp; Nemnyus, to-gedere þey went, Þey set o þe Romayns a gret partie, &amp; beot hem doun as men hardie, &amp; seide “Turne we vpon Sezar!” &amp; als þey rod, þey were hym war. Nemmyus fyrst ferde in þe stour, &amp; bated hym opon þe emperour, And ful glad was þat he myght Wiþ so noble a lordyng fyght. Cesar perseyued þat he cam, A-geyn his scheld a strok vp nam; Cesars swerd was out ful sone; Nemny to smyte he was al bone, &amp; Nemny on þe heued he smot; Hit was trenchaunt, ouer fer hit bot, Bot Nemny bar vp his scheld, His heued a party lowe hit held; ?it þe strok sank so doun, Þorow þe helm he brak his croun; Lite failled þat he ne had Clouen þe hed, þe dynt was sad; Bot Nemny bar þe scheld o sker, &amp; Iulius smot his swerd ouer fer, Þat he ne myghte drawe hyt ageyn; Naþeles he dide þerto his peyn, He drow þe swerd, Nempny þe scheld, Ilkon wel his owen held; Nemny wilde haue turnd &amp; went, Bot Iulius wiþ þe draught hym hent; I hope Iulyus had drawen hit out, Bot Nemnyus fol[k] were egre &amp; stout. Androcheus, Nemnyus neuew, Wyþ hem of Kent dide gret prow; On ilka side þey slowe aboute, &amp; Cesar saw hym self in doute, &amp; fro þem fledde in to þe feld, &amp; lefte his swerd in Nemnyus scheld. Nemny saw of help ynow, He turned þe scheld, þe swerd out drow, &amp; wiþ þat swerd forþ he faught; Bot þo þat þer-wyþ woundes laught, Myghte þey neuere haue medecyne, Bot to þe deþ by-houed hem pyne. Als he þus faught, þys Nemmyus, He ouer-tok sire Labemnius,— A lord he was of gret baillye, In Rome he hadde a constablerye,— Nemnius swilk a strok hym lent, Þat by þe schuldres þe hed of went. How manye þer deide, y may nought ame; Of alle þe fighters y knowe no name; Bot þer was manyon doun leyd, Wel mo þan any man wrot or seyd, &amp; wel mo scholde ?it þat nyght, Had þey nought sondred for faute of lyght. De fuga Romanorum. Þen com þe nyght, gon was þe day, &amp; ilka party ?ede þer way. Þe Romayns syde was nought payd, Logges non hadde, þey were dismayed; Wery þey were, &amp; yuel lykande, ffor wiþ þe Brutons þey myght nout stande. Þey toke conseil a-wey to wende, No lenger in þys lond to lende; ffor þe contre knew þey nought, Logge ne recet had þey non wrought; To schipe þey wente þat ilke nyght, Vntil fflaundres þey fley þer flyght. Þe Bretons made blisse, ilkon, Þat þe Romayns were so gon; Bot þe kyng made sorewe ynow ffor Nemnyus, þat to deþe drow; Medicyne myghte non be founde Þat myghte hele Nemnyus wounde. Of sire Nemny nought elles to seye, Bot þe fiftenþe day Nemny gan deye. Þey buryed hym in a temple gate, In Londo?, atte Northe gate, Honurabloker þan an oþer, ffor he was þe kynges broþer. De gladio Cesaris. Þat swerd he wan of sire Cesar, By hym in graue þey leide hit þar, ffor he was of gret honur, &amp; he haddyt wonnen y þat stour. Þe swerd was of swylk metal, Þat who þat wounded were wyþ-al, He ne scholde nought longe lyue ffor medicine men myghte hym gyue. Why of deþ hit hadde þe gylt, Hit was writen on þe hilt Wyþ lettres of gold, burnusched bryght, Þat “Crucia mors” þat swerd hight: Hit myghte wel hote “Crucia mors;” Wham hit wounded, hit was ded cors; &amp; ?it hit ys seyd y þe Romaunce, Þe enperours swerd was al vengaunce. Til þeym of ffraunce cam tidyng tyt, How þe Romayns were desconfit Þorow þe Bretons in pleyn bataille. Þanne mysliked þeym saunz faille, And for cowardes þem selue ches, ffor þey were at [þe] Romayns pes. Þey conseilled þem a day certeyn, Vpon Cesar to turne a-geyn; In þer conseil þei seide þus: “Als þe Bretons chased Iulyus, “?ut schul we fonde so to spede, “To do sire Iulius fle for drede. “Þe Bretons be nought ?it so bolde “As we haue ben, [ne] men of tolde, “&amp; so lyghtly dide þem lout! “?it schul we fonde to chace hem out. “Hit are ynowe þat first han grace “ffor to wynne, &amp; robbe, &amp; chace, “&amp; siþen turnes þer praye til pyne; “Lyghtli þey wynne, lightly þey tyne: “Þer lordschip ?it schul we abate, “ffor alle þe world þey wynne wyþ hate.” Þus þey seyde þat þey wold do; &amp; ?it alday men telle þem so, Þat þe Bretons wolde fonde a flyght ffor to felle þe Romayns myght. Þat sawe made þeym wylde &amp; wod, &amp; reysed þem more vp in þer mod: Bot sone þer bost was al in griþ, Whan sire Iulius had spoken hem wyþ. Sire Iulius Cesar was ful queynte, Wisdam he couþe, &amp; wordes feynte; A folet couþe he wel adaunte, To proude men þer wylle graunte. De blandiscione Cesarys. Wel couþe he paye þe couetous, &amp; wynne þe wille of þe enuyous; &amp; ful wel couþe bere hym meke When his strength was for to seke. He wiste þat þe frenche men were fykel, &amp; how þey forcedem agayn hym mykel; &amp; his men were yuel dight, Wery &amp; wounded al in fight; Leuer hym were in loue þem loute, Þan in bataille to ben in doute; Þe Bretons hadden hasted hem so, Þat tyme in dede myghte þey nought do. Wyþ faire wordes hem to hym drow; &amp; gaf hem giftes &amp; richesse ynow,— ffor of his giftes he was ful large, ffor schame þey moughte hym namore charge;— &amp; more he byhet, þan gyue he myght, Þe Bretons to wynne wiþ force &amp; fight. To pore men he gaf fraunchise, &amp; cleymed þeym quit of þer seruise; Þo men he hadde flemed þe contre, To comen ageyn he gaf hem fre, &amp; to haue þer heritage, &amp; restored þeym of here damage. Þerfore when þis grete lordynges Seyen Cesar ofre þem swylke þynges— Gold &amp; syluer atter wille— In pes þey held hem alle stille. Mikel ys richesse of power! ffor sone had he bated wo &amp; wer, Sone had he turned wrong to right, Sone had he blent þe coueytous sight, Sone made he frend þat er were wroþe, Of Cesar &amp; þe ffrankysche boþe; ffor þo þat hym byforen hated, Wiþ hys gyftes were alle abated; Þat schopen hym yuel &amp; outrage, Þey diden hym fewte &amp; homage, At his conseil for to lende, Ageyn þe Bretons ?yf he wold wende. Whan sire Cesar, lord &amp; sire, Had pesed &amp; swaged al þer ire, He conseilled hym wyþ an engynour, &amp; dide hym make a merueyllous tour In Boloygne: “Ordre” ys þe name. So wrought ys non bot þat same; By-neþen hit is in strange compas; Brod &amp; þykke þe gynnynge was, &amp; euere hit nareweþ rysande on heyght, &amp; semeþ griller &amp; more streight. Selcouþe stages ar þer-ynne, Wyndowes cast, coruen wiþ gynne. His tresor he leyde þer inne to lok, Onlyke þer al þat he toke; &amp; hym self lay in þe tour, When he dred hym of his tresour. Two ?er he dwelled þer in ffraunce, &amp; dight hit for werre in alle chaunce; He sente to baillifs to gadere hym fees, &amp; reisede his truwage of his citees. Whan al was gadered on ylk party, In Ordre þey leide hit in tresory. In two ?er he dide hym dight, &amp; made hym to Brutayne right, &amp; dide hym dighte a fflute on flode, Sex hundred gret schipes &amp; gode, &amp; seide, “?it wyly make assay “Vpon þe Bretons, spede how y may; “Bot ?if y may conquere Cassibolan, “Y preise nought elles al þat y er wan; “Al my conqueste preise y nought, “Bot þe Bretons to trewe be brought.” De subuersione nauigii Cesaris in Tamysia. Whan hit was dight, al his flet, Wyþ god folk &amp; vitailles set, Þe schipes seyled day &amp; nyght Til þey come in to Temese right. Þus þey wend, þat atte firste tyde Þer nauye to Londone holy schold ryde; Alle at ones þe scholde vp saille, &amp; to þe Bretons gyue bataille. Þe Bretons wist hit wel ynow, Bot of þer sleigþe lystneþ now; Longe pyles &amp; grete dide þey make; ffaste yn Temese dide þey hem stake, Euerylkon wyþ iren schod; Ageyn þe schipes stod ilkon od, fful wel set, &amp; sykerly; Þer myght non wel ascape forby. De bello inter Cesarem &amp; Brutones in Tamysia. Right atte fulle se of flod Com alle six hundred schipes god; Sykerly þey wend haue nomen, &amp; into Londone at ones comen. Þey ne were wyþynne bot a lite, Or on þe pyles gon þey smyte. Þer myght men se þat stod on brynke, Schipes in-to þe water synke; Þat on vn-to þe toþer hurte, Þe mastes faste to-gidere burte, &amp; somme ouer-terned, &amp; lay on syde; Bordes ryuen out holes wyde, Ropes ryuereled, &amp; swerued in lyne, Ilkon dered oþer, &amp; dide pyne; Lond ne hauene myght þey non taken, So faste on pyles gan þey staken: In yuel tyme out þey nomen, Yuel þey ryued þat þider comen! Cesar saw þat grete vnhap, Þat in þe water was swylk a trap; Iren-schod was ilka peel, &amp; þoughte þat so was ilka del; Many of þem turned a-geyn, &amp; seyde þat wendyng was in veyn. He dide þem alle gon vp to londe, Man &amp; hors, þer þey best fonde; By bankes vp aboute þey wente, &amp; pyght þeym pauylons &amp; tente. Right als þey picched þer pauylons, Cam Cassibolan wyþ þe Bretons, Erles, barons, knyghte, squiers, Asperly folle on þe Romayners:— His neuew &amp; oþere of his kynde, Wyþ alle þe oþere þat he myghte fynde, Þe kynge asemblede in noble wyse, ffor wiþ þe Bretons was no feyntise:— &amp; at þer logges þer þey hem set, Þe Bretons wyþ hem þer þey met. Þeyr egre comyng þe Romayns a-boden, A-geyn þe Brutons stifly þey stoden; Als a wal þe scheltrom held, &amp; ruysed þe Brutons abak in feld. ffirst þe Romayns ful wel stoden, Agayn þe Bretons in bataille ?oden, &amp; fer bakward dide hem go, &amp; manyon slowe, &amp; wroughte wo. Þenne was wroþ Cassibolan; ffor tene byfore þem alle he nam, &amp; bar þe breste on þem by-fore, &amp; after hym þe Bretons gaf bore, &amp; euere was fresche folk comande, And dide þe Romayns ageyn stande. So wyþynne a litel þrowe Men amed þem, &amp; wel hit sowe, Two so many Bretons þare As hadde þer Iulius Cesare, &amp; dide þe Romayns a-geyn to fle, &amp; slowe þem, schame was hit to se! De probitate Brutonum. Hardy Cesar, noble kyng, Þat neuere so bayscht was for no þyng, He sey þe force of þe Brutons, &amp; hyse to þem hadde no fuysons. Þe Bretons, as wode, rengede route; Of dynt ne deþ had þey no doute; Þey slowe, &amp; felde, &amp; made þem weye; Þey made no force to lyue ne deye. Cesar perceyued þat ful wel, He dide turne hys folk ylk del A-geyn, &amp; to þer schipes wende; Bot hym self lefte til þe last ende, A-gayn þe Bretons for to fyght, Þe whyles his folk to schipe þem dight. By þe lond þe schypes did ryde, To kepe his folk at ilka tyde; When alle were ynne, &amp; sayl on mast, Cesar com yn alder last; &amp; alle þat were of his conrey, Hyed þem faste, &amp; wente þer wey. Euene as lyne þe wynd gan dryue; At Ordre, his tour, gon þey aryue. Cesar soiourned þer ful longe, To hele þem þat were wounded stronge, &amp; man &amp; hors for to rest, And ordeyned for hym what was best. Þe kyng of þys lond, Cassibalan, &amp; þe Bretons ilka man, Made ioye for þe mykel pris Þat þey had wonnen of Cesar twys. Þe Romayns, mykel sorewe þey made Þat þe Bretons were so glade; Cesar &amp; hyse were dismayed, Bot þe Bretons were wol payed. Pro Victoria eorum optulerunt solempnem sacrificium Diane diis suis. ffor ioie þey hadden þo batalle wonnen, &amp; Cesar twyes had ouer-ronnen, To God þey highte to make a feste Wyþ alle þe comme[n]s lest &amp; meste. Þe day he set of þe sacrifise, Hys vow to holde wyþ fair seruise. Cassibalon sende his messegers ffor þe barons, knyghtes, &amp; squiers, Of his demeynes alle þe pytaille Þat hadde hym serued in bataille, Þat þey scholde alle to London come, Vp peyne of forfeture of dome, Wyf &amp; child wiþ hem schold lede, Þo þat halp hym in his nede, &amp; alle come wiþ herte glad, In riche atyr, ryght as he bad.

Þys feste day þat was so hey, Were offred ffifty þousand ky, &amp;, þer-to, þre þousand hyndes, Wylde walkande by wode lyndes; &amp; an hundred þousand schep; Þe noumbre of foules gaf noman kep, So fele þer were, myght non þem ame, What of wilde, what of tame. When don was þat sacrefyse, &amp; feste holde in þer beste wyse, Mynstrals bygon to blowe &amp; ryme, Als þer custume was þat tyme; Knyghtes, squiers, made bourdys, &amp; hem desgysede in pourpre &amp; bys; &amp; oþer bachelers skirmede faste, Wrastlede, lepen, stones caste; In feld, in toun, in ilka weye, Ilkon pleide þat he couþe pleye.

When ilk had seyd til oþer wough, Wyþ wraþe to smyte, þe egge drough: Þorow a meschaunce, y wot hit was, Huwelyn slow þer Irelgas. When þe kyng þys chaunce herd seye, Þe feste was sturbled &amp; aweye. ffor þe kyng was ful feloun, &amp; hastyf, vntil vengaunce boun, Þe kyng seid vntil Androche, &amp; bad hym vp peyne of alle his fe, Huwelyn, his cosyn, hym for to sende, Þat felonie for to amende, &amp; in his court haue iugement Þorow þe comunes, er þat þey went. Androcheus þoughte wyþ herte ful wo: “?if y hym sende, he schal hym slo.” Androcheus sende ageyn ful tyt, &amp; of his court asked respit: “A lord y am, &amp; court y haue; “Þorow þat wyl y hym dampne or saue. “?yf þer be eyþer baron or knyght, “Pleyneþ hym þer, he schal haue right; “&amp; þe souereynte þou takest þe to, “Hit schold be myn, &amp; schal be so; “Þou wost hit ys myn heritage; “Þou bedes me mys &amp; outrage!” Rex irascatur versus Androcheum nepotem suum.

On þis manere parted þer feste; Wiþ loue bygan, endede wiþ cheste. Cassibolan was Androcheus eem, Luddes broþer of þat teem. Androcheus was Luddesone, &amp; Temnace, As y forn telde in oþer place. Whan Lud deyde, þey ne couþe Kepe þe lond for þer ?ouþe; Cassibolan þerfore vndertok Þe lond, &amp; hem to kepe &amp; lok; &amp; þorow þe wroþe of þis þynge Made Androche a chalangyng.

O side he trauersed vnto a hil, So nede hym byhoued, or be in clos. On boþe sides he saw his foos, He seide hym self þo, he was bitraischt; Þen were þe Bretons alle abaischt. Hic Cassibolanus se retraxit. Ilk þat þer myght fle, þey fledde; Þat best myght renne, best he spedde; Bettere was fle, þan worse abide, ffor socour þer cam on none syde.

To þat playne þey come þat day, Of Salesbury, þe firste of May, Many a man (wyþoute somons) Of þe Saxons &amp; of þe Bretons: Hereþ now how Hengist þought, What treson he schop to be wrought. “ffelawes,” he seyde, “what so bytydes, “Get ?ow knyues egged on boþe sydes, “&amp; ber þem priuely, þat non ne se, “In ?oure hoses harde by ?our kne. “When we haue þem, &amp; þey vs gret, “&amp; ilkon of vs by a Breton set,— “On alle manere fondes how, “Ay on of hem, anoþer of ?ow,— “Nymeþ out ?our sexes when y so say, “&amp; handes on ?our felawes lay, “On ilka Breton þat sittes ?ou nest, “&amp; strykeþ hem ded þorow bak &amp; brest.” When Hengist to þem þus had yseyd, Ilka Saxon a sex purueyd, &amp; com to þe Playne of Salesbury, ffair felawschip, &amp; ful mury.

He seyde he wolde ouer se to Fraunce, &amp; wynne hit al wyþ dynt of launce. But first he seide ‘he wolde to Norweye, ‘Þe kyng had sent hym bode he hoped to deye; “&amp; Loth, myn neuew, schal he his eyr; “To make hym kyng y am in speyr; “His neuew he ys, of next degre, “Of blod ys non nerrer þan he.” Right as he seyde, also he þought, He wende þe barons wolde so haue wrought; But when þey seye þat he was ded, Þey toke þem til anoþer red: Loth to haue, þey hym forsok, &amp; anoþer kyng þey tok; ffor alle þey seide wyþ o mouþ, ‘Þey wolde haue no kyng vncouþ; ‘Þey hoped nought þey schold hym fynde ‘Als godliche as þer owen kynde. ‘Alyens,’ þey seyde, ‘he wolde auaunce, ‘Þat schulde be þeire appurtynaunce. ‘A heued þey wolde haue þem aboue, ‘Þat hem wolde auaunce &amp; loue.’ Þorow þat consail &amp; þat reson, Rycolf þey ches, was a baron, &amp; coroned hym, &amp; now ys kyng; &amp; þus haþ Lot lorn þat þyng. “ffor help,” seid Arthur, “Loth haþ bysought; “ffaille hym by no weye wol y nought; “Y wolde his honur &amp; [his] right, “&amp; þat schal y he[l]pe at my myght. “Rycolfes coroune y wolde abate, “Þat þe Noreys gef hym so late.” De conquestu Norganie. Tyl Arthur com þer folk ynow; To schipes on flode faste þey drow; Þe wynd blew, &amp; gan hem dryue, Vp in Norweye gon þey aryue. Ricolf was god, &amp; wolde nought fle Ne remue hym out of þe contre; He gadered host, for wel he wende Ageyn Arthur hym self defende; But his wenyng was al veyn, ffor Ricolf &amp; hise wer alle þer sleyn. When Arthur hadde Norweye wonnen, Þe barons alle ouer riden &amp; ronnen, Loth, his neuew, he gaf þe croun, After Ricolf þat was doun. Loth made Arthur þenne feute, Als til his chef ouer al þat fe. Lothes sone, sire Wawayn, Had ben at Rome to lere Romayn, Wyþ Supplice þe Apostoille to wone, Honur to lere, langage to kone; &amp; þere was he dubbed knyght. And holden hardy, strong, &amp; wyght. When Supplice had don his ende, Tyl Bretayne-ward Wawayn gan wende. Now ys Wawayn comen hom, fful blithe ys Loth al of his com; Noble he was, &amp; ful curteys, Mykel honur of hym euere men seys: He loued mesure &amp; faire beryng; Pruyde ne bost loued he no þyng; Vnkynde, false, &amp; fykele, he hated; Lesynges, alle swilk he abated; More he gaf þan he by-hette, Wel more he dide þan terme of sette. Now ys Loth in Norweye seised, &amp; Wawayn comen, þat mykel ys preised. Alle þo men þat were of myght, Þat weren ?onge, &amp; couþe of fyght, &amp; loueden more werre þan pes, Arthur til hym alle swyche ches; Of swylk gadered he many on, &amp; schipes on se ful god won. When his host was styf &amp; stark, He schiped to-wardes Denemark. Achil, þat þen was kyng of Danes, Saw Bretons &amp; Noreys come alle at anes Wyþ Arthur, to wynne his lond, &amp; for to destruye al þat he fond. But Achil þoughte, as kyng ful wys, Þat Arthur oueral hadde þe prys; He wiste wel he schulde conquere His lond of hym, ?yf he come þere; But he seide ‘he wolde nought so ‘Hym seluen ne his lond fur-do, ‘Ne suffre his folk to be slayn, ‘Ne his tresor spende in vayn, ‘Ne his casteles beten doun, ‘Ne kirke robbed, ne brenne toun;’ But faire he spak, &amp; wel he hette, &amp; wysly gaf giftes wel bysette, So þat of Arthur he had grauntise, Þe lond in pes for his seruise; &amp; Arthur þen his seruise tok, Omage he swor hym on þe bok. Arthur was glad þat he þus wan, So sone þe kyng bicam his man; But ?ut he þoughte to wynne wel more. Of þe beste knyghtes he ches þore, &amp; squiers bolde, &amp; gode archers, Þat louede werre, &amp; knew þe maners— I ne wot how manye þousandes Þat he so gadered y þo landes;— Of gret folk mad he purueaunce, ffor he seyde he wolde to ffraunce: fflaundre he wan, Boloyne he tok; Tounes, casteles, for hym þey quok; His folk so wysly gan he lede, Struyed he no lond als he ?ede, He tok no þyng fer ne hende, But mete &amp; drynke, &amp; hors prouende; ?it toke þei non wyþ no maistrie, But bought hit þere hit was to bye. Þat tyme þat þis chaunce gan falle, Þat now hat ffraunce, þo hight hit Galle; Þe Romayns þat ilke tyme hit held, Was þer no kyng bar croune ne scheld; &amp; ilk ?er toke þey þer-of truage, Syþen Iulius wan hit in seruage. De ffrollo, Romano Regente ffrancie. Frolle, a doughti bacheler, Had hit in kepyng many a ?er; To Romayns byhoue gadered þer rent, &amp; at termes to Rome hit sent, Or bar hit hym self to þe Emperour. ffrolle was a ful hardy man in stour, He was comen of Romayns blod, He dredde non þat ageyns hym stod. Al day tydyng men hym told, Þat Arthur com wyþ host ful bold, &amp; þat no man myghte dwelle ne be But ?if he helde of hym in fe. Þat herde ffrolle, &amp; was ful wo, &amp; seide hit schuld nought þat wey go. He dide somoune alle to come Til hym, þat helde þer fe of Rome, ffor to brynge hors &amp; armes, Þe lond for to fende fro harmes, &amp; doughtily to-gydere stande Ageyn Arthur þat was comande.

Hit was no wonder þat he fledde, ffor þe gret host þat Arthur ay ledde; Was non þat couþe hit noumbre ne seye, Þe folk he tok, comynge in weye; Hit was no lond þat he þorow sought, Euere þe beste wyþ hym he brought; Þat doughti was on horse or fote, Wold he, nold he, forþ he mote: Somme wente for his fair speche, &amp; somme for drede of oþer wreche, &amp; somme for he gaf largely, &amp; somme for his grete curtesy, &amp; somme for los &amp; doute of ded, Knowlechyng til hym þey bed: Of ffraunce many a lordyng Comen to holde of hym þer þyng. De obsidione ffrolly per Arthurum. ffrolle fledde faste to Parys, Hit was þe strengest cite of pris; He knew no bettere recet to haue Ageyn Arthur, þat myghte hym saue; Night &amp; day dide his trauaille To warnische þe toun wyþ vitaille. Mykel folk to Paris fledde, &amp; Arthur þider faste hym spedde; &amp; Arthur vnderstod ful wel Þe purueaunce of ffrolle ilka del; Þer-fore he hasted his sege to sette, His purueaunce for to lette. Arthur byseged hym so streit Þat ffrolle mighte wyþ no deseit Of vitaille helpe hym at nede, By londe ne by water lede Ner al a monþe, as men teld, Þat ffrolle þe cite of Paris held; &amp; al þat tyme Arthur þer lay, He ne remued night ne day. So mykel folk was þer-ynne, Þe raþer bigan þer fight to gynne; Hit was despended, þat þey in drow; Þey hadde no tyme to drawe inow; ffor hunger gan þey make mone, Men, women, &amp; childre, ilkone. ?yf ffrolle wylde as þey wolde, Þe toun had ben ful sone ?olde; Þey preied ffrolle þorow þe burghe To make pes wyþ kyng Arthurghe. ffrolle saw þey pleyned þem sore, &amp; þer vitaille was namore, &amp; seye wel þey alle wylde Þe toun vntil Arthur ?ylde; &amp; [þat] þought hym schame &amp; vyl; Hym self had leuere be in peril, &amp; auenture hym his deþ to take, Þan wyþ his wille Parys fursake; “Strengþe of body or wille y fonde.” Tyl Arþur he sente his sonde: ‘?yf þat he wilde bytwyxt þem to ‘To-gedere fighte, wyþoute mo, ‘&amp; whilk of þem were ouer-come, ‘Or slayn, or wyþ force nome, ‘Tak hym þe lond til his wylle, ‘So þat þe folk nought ne spille.’ Þat bode cam Arþur wel to hert; His gloue he gaf vp al so smert, &amp; tok hostage o boþe partys, Of Arthures host &amp; of Parys, Þe bataille scholde be in a pleyne Bytwyxt two watres, Marne &amp; Seyne. De bello inter Regem Arthurum &amp; ffrollum. When þey were armed &amp; redy dight, &amp; were comen þer þey schold fyght, Men myght þer se folk tremble &amp; quake, On boþe partis gret deol to make, Handes wrynge, on knes to falle, On Godes name to crie &amp; calle, ‘Þat he myght wynne, þat pes wold haue, ‘&amp; þe lond fro werre myght saue.’ Arþures folk stode &amp; byheld, Redy [digh]t wyþ helm &amp; scheld, &amp; by[sought]e God inderly To [graunt] Arþur þe maistri. Þy[se two] knyghtes þat forþ were fet, N[obilly di]ght, on horse wel set, T[o assay]e þem how þey were wyght, [Þe lanc]e to reyse, þer scheld to ryght. [Who myg]hte wel telle, &amp; soþ to seye, [Þat sui]lk wer non þat tyme als þey; [Ilk o]f þeym was horsed wel, [Had a]rmes stronge as any stel; By sight myght non þer chese þe best, Ne whilk þen semed doughtiest; Ne whilk schold wynne, ne haue þe gre, By sighte myghte þer non hit se. When þey were bone, redy to smite, &amp; þer hors sondred a lyte, Wyþ speres þey smot, þe bridel brayd, Þer scheldes sette, þer launces forþ layd; Þer horses at þer power runnen, Þe partis wende haue lorn or wonnen; But ffrolle failled of his dynt,— I trowe his stede a syde stynt,— &amp; Arthur smot hym in þe scheld. Þe hed was god, &amp; ful wel held, &amp; ffrolle out of his sadel cast So fer so þe launce might last. ffrolle vp stirte, &amp; sydlynges glent, His scheld dressed, his launce vp hent; Til Arþures stede þe point he bar, Þorow þe breste þe herte he schar. Arþur fel; he moste nede; He was a fote, ded was his stede. Þe Bretons seye he had þat fal, Þem þoughte for wo þey al to-swal, Þe erþe dunede for þeir cry, To passe þe water þey were redy, Þe trewes to breke þey were ful wylde, To haue gon ouer in to þe ilde; But þey sawe hym sone vp a-geyn; Þey wyþstod þen, &amp; were fayn. When he was vp, he hadde no rest, Wyþ ffrolle to fighte he was ful prest, He leyde his hand to Caliborne, Þat neuere for armes wolde scurne. Þer-wyþ on ffrolle ful sore he sought, &amp; ffrolle a-geyn ne dredde hym nought; Agayn Arthur he stod &amp; stynt, Nought abaischt hym for no dynt; His swerd had drawen, he lyft hit heye, On Arþur he let hit sore fleye: Þe dynt was gret, for he was strong, Þe fir out fley, þe sparkles sprong, Þe helm he claf, &amp; þe basyn, &amp; þe coyfe þat was so fyn. Þe swerd was scharp, &amp; ful wel bot, In þe forehed Arþur he smot, Þorow þe flesche, vnto þe pan; After þe strok þe blod out ran. De occisione ffrolly, Regentis ffrancie. When Arthur felde þat he was wounded, Noþyng he ne stinte ne stounded; ffor, ful of yre, wyþ colour teint, Was he neyþer abaischt ne feint; Caliborne he hadde in hande, He tok hym byre þe strok teysande; Abouen his helm ful faste he dref; Hed &amp; nekke &amp; breste he clef. Þey of þe cite mad deol ynow, &amp; þe Bretons þer-fore þey low; What sorewe so þey made al gates, Agayns Arthur þey opened þe gates, And let hym in, &amp; alle hyse, &amp; dide hym omage &amp; seruise. When he had homage of lef &amp; loþ, Hostages he tok to halde þer oþ; At Parys to soiourne he ches; Baillifs he sette to ?eme þe pes; He parted his host in haluendel, Bytaughte he þem to sire Ohel, &amp; bad hym ‘go to wynne Burgoyne, ‘Peytowe, Nauerne, &amp; Gascoigne, ‘&amp; Lorreyne, ?yf he myghte, ‘Assaye þem wyþ loue or fyghte.’ Ohel dide his comaundement, He tok þe folk, &amp; þyder went; And alle þo landes þat y haue seyd, To gyue truage on þem he leyd. De austeritate Gwytardi. Gwithard, þe Duk of Peyters, Was a fel knyght &amp; a fers ffor to kepe his heritage, Nought ne wolde gyue truage; Often he turnde Ohel þe vys, &amp; often of hym wan þe pris, &amp; often a-geyn hym he les Er þan he wolde come til þe pes. Ohel destruide ner al þe lond; Þat he wyþouten castel fond, Al was destruyed, &amp; al was reft, Þe selue vynes þey ne left. When Gwytard saw ner al was lorn, So þat he ne mighte be byforn, He saw hit was non oþer bote, Bot ?ede &amp; fel Arthur to fote, &amp; dide hym homage &amp; feute, Of hym to halden al his fe. Syþen loued Arthur Gwytard ful wel, Non so mykel, but only Ohel. Þo oþere contres south fro ffraunce, Arthur þem wan til his alliaunce. Hic remunerauit Arthurus famulos &amp; seruientes. When Arthur had geten alle þo landes, &amp; wonne hem wyþ dint of his handes, Til þo men þat trauailled sore, Wel of elde þat wyþ hym wore, ?ald hem þer sond &amp; þer seruise, Vnto þer contres he bad þem wyse. But þo þat were ?onge &amp; wylde, Þat neyþer hadde wyf ne childe, &amp; louede to bere spere &amp; scheld, Nyne ?er in ffraunce he þem held. Manye wondres by times sers Bytydde Arthur þo nyn[e] ?eres; Many a proud man lowe he brought, Til many felon, wo he wrought; Enuyous men he hated alle, Þe mysproude ful lowe dide falle. Þer haue men bokes of al his lyf, Þer are his merueilles red ful ryf; Þat we of hym here alle rede, Þere were þey writen ilka dede. Þyse grete bokes so faire langage, Writen &amp; spoken of ffraunces vsage, Þat neuere was writen þorow Englischemen, Swilk stile to speke, kynde ne can, But ffrensche men wryten hit in prose, Right as he dide, hym for to alose; In prose al of hym ys writen, Þe bettere til vnderstande &amp; wyten. Hic diuisit Arthurus Prouincias, &amp; dedit Ducibus Comitibus, Baronibus, Militibus, &amp; aliis, secundum probitates suas. Arthur at Pasches, at Parys, He held his feste of gret[e] pris: Til alle þo þorow hym had lorn, Restored he als þey were byforn; Riche or pore, gentil or þral, Þat he þem aughte, he ?ald þem al. After þat he was worthy, He ?ald þer seruise largely: To Kaye þat was his stywarde, Aungowe he gaf hym til his part; He gaf also sire Beduer, Þat was of fe his boteler, He gaf hym in fe all Normandie, But þenne hit was cald Neustrie; Boloyne he gaf to sire Holdyn, And Mayne to Borel his cosyn; He gaf giftes of honurs, &amp; landes &amp; rentes, to vauasours. Reuersio Arthury in Angliam, in Mense Aprilis. When he had feffed his barouns, &amp; mad his priues lordes of touns, Þe nexte April, when somer gan, Til Ingeland wente ilka man. When men wiste þat þey wer comen, Ageyn Arthur faste þey nomen; Þey made suche ioye, non myghte be more; Hys longe dwellyng þem for-þoughte sore; Ladyes kyste þer lordes swete, Modres &amp; childre for ioye gon grete, Sones welcomed þer fadres home, &amp; made al murthe for þer come; Lemmans leue ilk oþer kest, Of more þey esed hem when þem lest; Neueus nyftes, sistres broþer, Ilka frend welcomede oþer; Þey stode in ilka strete &amp; sty, In grete routes men passed for-by, Þey spirde at hem ‘how þey hadde faren, ‘&amp; whi þat þey so longe waren, ‘&amp; how þey spedde of þeyr conquest, ‘&amp; what þey wonne so fer est, ‘&amp; how þey ferde in al þer wo: “We wole namore ?e fare vs fro.” &amp; þen þey teld hem al þer chaunce, How Arthur hadde wonne ffraunce, &amp; of merueilles þat þey had sen, &amp; in what peryl þey had ben. Þe lordynges of þys lond Þat Arthur bifore hym fond, Riche presentes þey hym sent, Hys longe dwellyng mykel þey ment; &amp; he ageyn was ful curteys, Some gaf he hors or oþer harneys; Gladly he gaf, &amp; largely. ffor to schewe his curtesy, ffor to schewe his grete prowesse, &amp; do by-knowe his grete richesse, &amp; for to speken of his dedes Þat alle kynges doutes &amp; dredes, Þey conseilled hym his lond to somoune, At Whitsonday, to do hym coroune.

When Arthur hadde herd þe pleynt, How wyþ þe geaunt þe folk was teynt, He calde sire Caye &amp; Beduer, &amp; ilk of þeym tok a squyer; Armure dide þey wiþ hem lede, &amp; ilk of þeym tok hym a stede. He nolde schewe hit to namo Þat he wolde to þe geaunt go; ?yf alle had wyst he wente so one, Þe ost had ben abaischt ilkone; He tristed wel in Godes grace Þat he durste hym schewe his face, &amp; on his grete vaillauntise Ar he durst take þat emprise.

Þen bad he sire Beduer “go “To serche þe hilles to &amp; fro; “&amp; when þou wost þe certeyn, “Hye þe þanne to me a-geyn.” Þenne Beduer dide hym in þe bot, &amp; on þe nexte hil he smot. Beduer stod, &amp; hym auysed Whider-ward þe weyes wysed; Þe nexte wey he tok vp hey, &amp; als he wente he herde a cry; Gret pleynte he herde on make; A party gan his herte quake; He wende hit hadde þe geaunt ben, Þat his comyng had wist or sen; He drow hys swerd al so smert, &amp; gadered hardinesse of hert, &amp; þought þat ?yf he wyþ hym mette, Wyþ hym to fighte he wolde nought lette. But al þat þenkyng was in vayn, ffor on þe hil aboue þe playn He fond a fir brennyng an hy, &amp; a toumbe newe þer-by; Als he bar his swerd in hande, By þe toumbe he sey on sittande, A womman, ner al naked, Aboute hure hed hure her to-schaked; Biside þe toumbe þis womman lay, &amp; often cried “wey la way!” &amp; mente þe vilenye &amp; þe peyne, &amp; seide, “alas for þe, Eleyne!” De Tumba Elene, &amp; de nutrice eius.

When þe geaunt of hym was war, fferly he hadde how he cam þar, &amp; stirte vp þenne al o glyft, His grete mace for to lyft; But Arthur auised hym wel ynow; Als he hys mace vpward drow, Arthur bar on hym wyþ his launce To combren hym, als of chaunce; Longe þey foughte, a wel god while, But Arthur couþe mykel of gyle; Nere sleighte &amp; queyntise hadde ben, &amp; gile, Somme had be combred þer in a whyle; ffor kyng Arthur neuere er was Bystad in so hard a cas.

Þen smot þe geaunt on his scheld, &amp; wyþ þat dynt so heuy &amp; stronge Þe hilles alle aboute ronge, &amp; al þat was þer-inne, hit schok When Arthur þat dynt so huge tok. Arthur was stoneyd, stakered, &amp; stynt, But ?ut fel he nought for þat dynt. Anoþer strok wold he nought byde, But peyned hym to smyte a syde Wyþ his swerd Caliborne; Scharply he gan hym torne; Þat swerd he lifte wel on hey, &amp; valede his scheld a party; Endlong his forehed he hym smot, Þe swerd bot wel, &amp; he was hot, &amp; entamed boþe his bryn Þat al þe skyn heng ouer hys eyn.

Hic narrauit Arthurus Beduero &amp; Kayo de gigante Rytone.

Þat geaunt Riton sende his sonde Til Arthur fro ferne londe, &amp; seide he scholde make hym a-ferd But he flowe of his owen berd, &amp; sent hit hym vntil his pane, To menske hit þer hit was wane; &amp; ?yf he sent hit hym bleþely, He schulde set hit most worschipfuly, ffor he wolde vrle his pane wyþ-al Aboute wiþ a ffylet smal; And ?yf Arthur wylde nought Do als Ryton hym bisought, Greyþe hym as sone as he myght, ffor Ryton wolde wyþ hym fight; &amp; whilk of þem might oþer slo, His berd he scholde don of flo, &amp; haue þe pane ilka del, Þer-wyþ aboute vrle hit wel.

Wiþ hym come þre þousand knyghtes, &amp; archers gode at alle rightes, &amp; on þe Romayns smyten ful tit, Þat had our Bretons ner desconfit; Þeir scharpe speres &amp; scheld forþ leyd, An hundred þei felde atte firste breyd, Þat neuere eft þey ne ros, Of þe Bretons to wynne los. Iam Romany tymorati sunt. Þenne were þe Romayn[s] al a-baischt, &amp; al was schent þat or was trayst; Þey wende Arthur &amp; al his ost Had folewed þem in þat cost; Þe Peyteuyns faste þeym assailled, &amp; þe Bretons nought ne failled, Þe ton quiked þe toþer to lyue, Þe Romayns to greue, fast gon þey stryue, Þe Romayns in haste turnde &amp; fledde, Þey hadde no clos, but oueral spredde; To þer logges þer þey hem busched, Þey fledde, &amp; þer wer al to-lusched. But Ewander þat slow Borel, &amp; ffyue hundred wyþ sire Catel, Were alle slayn &amp; don in hold, Wyþouten lordes þat more were told. Þat þey wold haue, al þey hadden, Prysons y-nowe alle þey ladden; Þer þe bataille was, þey turnde ageyn, &amp; tryde þe Bretons fro ilk Romeyn. To seke Borel his men had hast, Þey fond hym sone, ?eldyng þe gast. Þe wounded men to saue þey sought, &amp; þe slayn to erþe þey brought. Þe firste prisons þat Arthur sent, Þo þat were charged, to Parys went; Þe oþere prisons þat þey last hent, Of þeym til Arthur þey made present, &amp; telde þem wel of þeyr deseit, How þeir hap was ner ouer-streit, &amp; how Vtred was þer socour, &amp; grately meyntende þem in stour, &amp; bed hem boldely to bataille wende; Of þemperour gat þey þe fairere ende. Þemperour herde þe Bretons sped Þorow þe help of sire Vtred, &amp; þat sire Ewander was slayn, &amp; þe oþere y-do to payn; Grace til hym wold non bytide, But euere mys happed on his syde; Þer-fore mykel he was dismayed, Þat werre was gonne, he was nought payed; Al þe day he studied &amp; þought Wheþer he wylde werre forþ or nought; To take þe bataille mykel he dredde, ffor he no tyme byfore ne spedde; Of þys to conseille he nyste at wham, Or leue al til anoþer cam; ?yf he left til anoþer wore, Þen shulde hym schame þat he com þore; Þus he þoughte to do or lete, ffor drede of Arthur þat was so grete. But þis conseil had he of som, Þat he schulde remue til Oston, &amp; passe by Langres þe contre, Þat nyght to reste in þat cite. At þe morn he gan to ride, &amp; cam to Langres y þe euen tyde. Inperator pre timore fugiit: tunc dixit Arthurus. Arthur herde hit sone seye How to Oston he tok þe wey, &amp; wolde nought to bataille stande Til hym com more help til hande; But þer-til Arthur nought ne radde, So longe abide til he folk hadde, But as priuely as men myght, He dide his ost remue þat nyght, &amp; let Langres on þe left, &amp; þe wey til Ostum hym reft. By o weye þat he wiste gayn, He passed hilles, wode, &amp; playn, Til þey com þer þe stret lay hey, In a valeye þat hatte Swesy; Þorow þat veleye alle camen, Þat fro Ostum to Langres namen. When þey were þere he bad þem rest, &amp; syþen ilkon þer armure on kest, To be redy, what tyme þey mette, Swyþe on hem to-gydere sette. Þer harneys &amp; þer frapaille Þat fel nought to be in bataille, Vnder an hil he set þem þere, As þey armed men alle were, Þat when þe Romayns on þem had sight, Þe mikelhed schuld make þem aflight. A legion þe kyng ches &amp; tok, Þe Erl of Gloucestre had þo to lok,— A legion ys of folk þat wex, Sex þousand, sex hundred, sexti &amp; sex,— &amp; tauht hym on an hil to byde: “Meue nought, for ought þat may bytide, “Til þat y come, when y se nede; “Þorow þe, we may stande &amp; spede. “?yf swylk auenture bytide or be, “Þat þe Romayns turn bak &amp; ffle, “ffolewe þou affter, þenne, &amp; slo; “In god tyme þider þou go.” Sire Moronthe seide hit schold be don. ?it tok þe kyng a legion Of doughti knyghtes horsed wel,— Þey bere þe name of þe beste eschel,— In more sight were þo set, Hym self was chef, &amp; he þem get; Þey were þo þat þe rounde table preised, Þat he had norisched &amp; vp reysed,— A-mong þo was þe dragoun Þat Arthur bar for gonfanoun;— Þat oþer was set at his pay On eyghte batailles of gode array; Alle were þey knyghtes gode, &amp; hardy men þat wel stode; He bisoughte þem at her might, When þe fotmen schulde fight, Þat horsmen come ouer-þwert, &amp; trauersed þe Romayns smert.

When Lucius had þus gat seid, fforþ þey ferde alle at o breyd, &amp; armed þem ilkon right wel, &amp; sette ilk man til his eschel: Kynge &amp; prynces of Payen Were medled among Cristen, Þat her landes of Rome held, &amp; to þer werre seruise of scheld. By milers &amp; by centeners Sette þey þe bataille seers; Horsmen, fotfolk, on ilka partie, Were somme set lowe, &amp; somme heye, Right after þat þeym god þought.

Þe Romayns comen fro-ward þe west, &amp; Arthures folk were al prest; On boþe sydes þey gonne to blowe Trumpes &amp; pipes a wel god þrowe; Þe batailles neyghed ney &amp; ney, Sadly passing, and softely. When þey seye þat þey might mete, Wyþ bowes &amp; arblastes gan þey schete, Dartes, launces, stones, kaste, On boþe parties þykke &amp; faste; Vneþes myght any open his eye, So þykke atones gon þey fleye,— Also þkke as snow þen snew, Or al so hail þat stormes blew,— Þorow scheldes smiten, &amp; þorow paunces. After þat schot, þey schote launces; ffer weys mighte men here þe brusche, A þousand breken at o frusche. After launces, wyþ swerdes smiten, &amp; wyþ axes &amp; daggares þat wel biten; Þer was bataille merueillous, Neuer non byfore so perilous, Ne non so asper ne so þyk, ffor ilk was oþer euen quik. Þat wel couþe feighte, he fond his mecche, Cowardie halp þer no wrecche. Al þe valeye aboute schok, So harde þe parties to-gidere tok; ffull harde to-gydere gan þey hurte, Þat on a-geyn þat oþer burte. Manye doun fulle, &amp; fele þer stod, &amp; mani on lay drenkled in blod; Many knyght of sadel was wrast, &amp; many stede wyþ hem were cast, &amp; many oþer wente o stray, Þe bridles broken, &amp; sadeles a-way. Wel þey foughte a ful long stounde, Ilk fonded oþer to haue to grounde. So vaillaunt was neuere no Romayn Þat myghte þe Bretons ruyse ones ageyn, Ne þe Bretons of þem nought wan, So wel þey stoden ilka man; Neþeles, foure batailles of oures Had hard encountre &amp; scharpe stoures,— Agusel &amp; sire Cador, Beofs &amp; Geryn, þyse were þor, Achil, Loth, &amp; sire Ohel, &amp; sire Wawayn þat dide so wel,— Þyse foure wyþ þe comun host, Alle had þey ful hand al-most.

Þey saw þe Bretons nought ne wan, Þe Romayns helde as þey bigan; To þem þey seyde þey wilde al-gate. On al þe pres þey gonne hem abate; In to al þe þrong þer was þykkest, Kay &amp; Beduer in gonne brest. fful wel faught Beduer, &amp; so dide Kay; Þo þat þey hitte, ded þey lay:— Þus seyde þo þat stode þem ner, Þat neuere styward ne botyler Þat serued kyng ne kayser, So wel halp at here power;— fful mikel þey dide, &amp; more þey scholde ?yf þey had lyued, &amp; Crist hit wolde.

Bokkes rod in wyþ a gleyue, ffayn wold he Beduer deseyue; In att þe brest Beduer he smot; Þe glayue was scharp, &amp; ouer fer bot; Scheld &amp; hauberk þorow he brak, Þe spere fley out al at his bak.

Als he schuld þer þe body vp fange, He dwelled þer-on a litel to lange, ffor þenne com Sentor, kyng of Lubye, Wiþ gret power of paynye, &amp; on sire Kay smot he þore, &amp; wounded hym ferly sore; But for no wo, wounde, ne dynt, Þe body ne lefte he, ne tynt. His gode folk was hym aboute, &amp; holpe hym of þat mykel doute; Þ? bodi þen to þe dragon brought, Maugre þo þat on hym sought. De probitate Irelgas, congnato Beduery. Sire Beduer cosyn hight Irelgas: When he wyste þat harde cas, What of his frendes, &amp; of his kynde, &amp; oþer þe beste þat he myght fynde, Þre hundred men wiþ helmes bright, &amp; wel horsed, &amp; al wel dight, When he had samned þem ilkone, “Lordynge, to ?ow now make y my mone! “At þis nedes helpeþ now, “Of þo houndes þat myn em slow! “Of Bokkus, þe kyng of Mede, “Aspieþ hym wel in ilka stede!” Þey serched ouer al vp &amp; doun Til þei seye his gonfanoun; When þey hit seye, þider gon þey drawe, On Kaliborne þey cried a þrawe.

When þey til his bataille were comen, So wel þey dide, þat þorow þem nomen; But Irelgas was euere byfore, After hym his folk held wel þe score; Syde &amp; oþer, þey lefte no þyng Vntil þey fond Bokkus þe kynge. When Irelgas was wel auised, His hors on hym his bridel wysed, He teysed his dint, Bokkes to smyte, Þe swerd was god, &amp; wel wold byte, Þe helm[it] clef, þe hauberk tar, Þorow-out þe breste þe swerd hym schar, I trowe þe soule to helle went, But Irelgas by þe arm hym hent, Þat þe body fel nought doun; He leide hum ouer-þwert hys arsoun; Þe knyght was god, þe hors was stronge, He turnde þer-wiþ out of þe þronge; Þe body to þer dragon bar,— Wel holp his men þat aboute hym war,— Bysyde his em þe body þrew, &amp; on peces hym al to-hew; Al to-hewen þer he hym let; Houndes, foules, his body ete. When Irelgas had don þat pris, “ffelawes,” he seyde, “graunt mercis! “Turne we ?ut on þem a-geyns, “&amp; folewe faste o þe Romeyns, “&amp; on þise houndes þat mys byleue, “Þat oure Cristene so mykel greue!” Þey turnde ageyn as men hardy; Þen myghte men here noise &amp; cry; Swerdes, helmes, men mighte se glyder, &amp; sparklyng as þey smyte to-gyder. Holdyn, þe Erl of fflaundres, held Gaunt &amp; Bruges vnder his scheld; Of a bataille he was cheftayne, He countred wyþ Alyfatyn of Spayne. So longe þat on þat oþer assailled, &amp; ilk on oþer so trauailled, Þat slayn was sire Alyfatyn, &amp; slayn was þe Erl Holdyn.

Þo þat first on Bretons brak, Þeir cheftayns slowe, dide þem gyue bak; Alle þo þey slowe, &amp; dide þem fle, &amp; turnde þem ouer, þat men myght se. So harde strokes þe Bretons gaf, Þe Romayns route al ouer-haf, Þat þe Romains, wold ho, ne wolde, fflede vnto þe Egle of golde. (Egle ys ern on Englische roun; Þat was þe Romayns gunphanoun.) Þere þey fond þe Emperour, &amp; of al Rome þer was þe flour. When þey seye þey come so ner, Þe Romains were þem ful auster; Nere herd þey seye, ne sawe hit writen, Swilk a stour to Romayns smyten, A doughty erl þat highte Kynmar, Wiþ sire Ohel þat tyme was þar; Don he hadde gret vasselage, Þe Romayns slayn at ilka stage; Mighte no Romayn hym a-scape, Þat to þe deþ he dide hym rape. A fotman þenne his bowe vp drow, &amp; Erl Kynmar atte lasste he slow, &amp; two þousand of þe Bretouns, Wiþoute men of grete renouns. De tribus sociis nobilibus. Þre noble knyghtes þer were, &amp; wyghte; Iugens, hit seyþ, þat on so hyghte,— Out of Bolayn, þeþen was he, A borough y wene, or a cite;— Þat oþer highte Rykomarkus, Þe þrydde men calde Boklonius; Þer wer non þre in al þe stour Þat wroughte after so gret honur; ?if þey had ben dukes or kynges, Of þem had ben grete preysynges; Þer was no Romayn bitwyxt hem cam, Þat awey wyþ lyf fro þem nam; Were he neuere so doughty, On lyue passed non forby; Right to þe Emperours owen bataille Þey ne lefte Romayns to assaille. Þat seye Romayns, þey dide gret wow, Þey closed hem, &amp; alle þre slow. When Wawayn wiste, &amp; sire Ohel, Þat her gode folk doun so fel, Was neuere lubard ne lyoun, Ne wilde wolf ne dragoun, Þat was so wod, beste to byte, As Wawayn was Romayns to smyte. Sire Ohel als on his partye, Many on dide he ded doun lye. Þe Romayns wel þem defended, Grete strokes on þe Bretons spended; But Wawayn was euere fresche &amp; prest, When oþer ne myghte, þan was he best; Was þer non helm wiþ stel so rank Þat his swerd þorow-out ne sank, Ne hauberk non, wyþ maille gret, Þat his spere ne þorow schet; Þat tyme manion dide he deye, &amp; þo þat myghte, made hym weye; Among þe moste euere he presed, His harde strokes nought ne sesed; Right to þe Emperour Lucius, Of Romayns he made rescous. Lucius was ?ong, ynow had elde, Hardy &amp; stalworthe, armes to welde; Bytwyxte þrytti &amp; fourty Was þe elde of sire Lucy. De Insulto Walwyny ad Inperatorem.

Right anon no þrowe abyden, But swyþe smertly to-gydere riden; Þeir schaftes schiuered, &amp; fleye in feld, But þey fel nought, ne donward held; Gode were þer brunyes, &amp; stronge of maille, Þer-fore þer dyntes myghte nought vaille; Wiþ swerd to smite þen þey hem hasted, On many manere ilk oþer tasted Ilk oþer to slo, ilk oþer to wounde, How eyþer myght oþer brynge to grounde: Þei proued byneþen and a-bouen, Wyþ swerdes poyntes sadly þei schouen; fful wel þei couþe ilk oþer assaye, &amp; þer as was peril ilk oþer affraye; fful sone schuld eyþer to deþ haue gon, ?yf þey nadde be let of non.

Þen were þe Bretons bakward born, Bretons wyþ-drowe, &amp; Romayns wonne, &amp; many on ouer riden &amp; ronne.

When Arthur sey his men gaf bak, Þe Romayns boldely on þem brak, &amp; poyned or pryked þem wyþ pres, &amp; þey wyþ-drowen hem, &amp; erþe þey les, Þen wolde Arthur no lenger byde, Ne myghte, ?yf he wolde saue his syde; He cam criynge wiþ his bataille, “Agayn, ?e Bretons, þe Romayns asaille! “Y am Arthur, þat wil nought faille! “At al ?oure nede y schal ?ow vaille! “Y am Arthur þat hider ?ow ledde, “Þat neuere in feld for no man fledde, “Ne deþ, ne dynt, ne bataille dredde! “In alle stours wel haue y spedde! “Y am Arthur, schal make ?ow weye, “&amp; Romayns to Rome for drede do fleye! “Loke þat non of ?ow recreye, “Ne at þys iourne feynte ne feye! “Þenkeþ now of ?our grete bountes, “How fele we haue wonne landes &amp; fees! “To day ne schal y fro þys feld fle “Til al be wonne or lorn þorow me!” De crudelitate fortissimi belly inter Arthurum &amp; Inperatorem. He smot his stede, &amp; forþ to go, Romayns to felle, Romayns to slo; Þo þat hit seye, myght hit wel seye, So mykel folk for hym gan deye, So many helmes for hym þorow dryuen, Scheldes clouen, hauberks ryuen, Þat Caliborne hadde þorow byten, Hedes, armes, legges, of smyten; I may nought seye al, ne how, At ilka dynt a man he slow. As þe lyon for hunger snacches &amp; sleþ þe best þat he first lacches, So ferd Arthur wyþ ilkon, Many hors, men, a lyue left non; Wham-so he myghte reche or smyte, Þough he hym wounded neuere so lyte, Leche craft couþe hym nought seye; ffor any medisine, nede most he deye: As þe wolf chaseþ þe schep, He dide þe Romayns by-fore hym lep; And als Arthur after þem schok, Sertor of Lubye he ouer-tok; His hed he smot of at o dynt, ffor non armure þe swerd ne stynt; Seide Arthur þen to þo þer ware, “Schame þe tyme þou armes bare! “&amp; þat þou come me so ney, “Caliborne to make blody!” Arthur ouer-gat in anoþer pres Þe kyng of Bythayne, Pollydetes, Of a lond of Payenye: A wonder strok Arthur let flye! By þe schuldres þe hed of plat; Þe hed fel doun, þe body vp sat. Þorow Arthures wordes &amp; dedes trayst, Þe Bretons bolded, &amp; Romayns abaischt; Netheles þe Romayns wel abod, Ageyn þe Bretons stifly rod, &amp; foughten as þey were wod, Wiþ gret strengþe a-geyn þem stod. ffor Arthur saw þey wolde nought scurne, He gaf þem strokes wyþ Caliborne. Þemperour þenne taried nought, On Arthures folk ful sore he sought, But þemperour ne Arthur þe kyng Mighte nought mete for no þynge; Mikel was þe pres, ful þykke þe þro, Þey myghte nought mete; Arthur was wo. Wel faught þe Breton, &amp; wel þe Romayn; A þousand wyþynne a þrowe were slayn; Might noman wyte ho schulde ?ut wynne, Ne whiche of hem wer oute ne inne; Þer was þe flour of boþe partis, &amp; neyþer side bar ?it þe pris. Moreont, of Gloucetre cheftayn, Meoued aboue vpon þe montayn; He sey þe bataille was ful long, Ne non ne fledde out of þe þrong; He hadde a legion of folk þat wex Sex þousand, sex hundred, sexti &amp; sex; And alle knyghtes wyþ helm on stede; &amp; þoughte þat Arthur hadde nede; He sey non þat hym ne gaf þe feld, &amp; til þe Bretons þer owen held; He þoughte þorow help of a lite Þey scholde þe Romayns desconfite, &amp; for to venge Arthures tene, Of þe Romayns þey schuld make clene.

Þer was þemperour slayn of chaunce Þorow-out þe body wiþ a launce;— Y can nought seye ho dide hym falle, But sire Wawayn, men seide hit alle; Y þe laste bataille þat in sprong, He was slayn þer among; Þe certeyn can þer noman ame, But sire Wawayn bar þe name;— Among þe dede þey hym founde, &amp; wiþ a spere was his wounde. Þe Romayns alle faste þey fledde, &amp; þe Payens for drede spredde; Whilk of þem þat swyþest nam, Þe Bretons kept þem as þey cam; Þey were wery alle to slo, ffor wery, manion let þey go; Þe blod ran þer as water stremes In chynes, in creuesses, &amp; in semes; Gode stedes &amp; palfrays ?ede o stray, ilk his ways. Arthur was glad þat þorow here dome Had so abated þe pride of Rome; ffor byforn, seyden alle þe Romayns, Þat non myght standen þem ageyns; Þerfore þanked Arthur God Almyght, Þat gaf hym þe maistri of hem þorow fight.

Kay, þat was wounded byforn, Vntil þe castel was he born; He compassed hit in lengþe &amp; brede Er he to þe bataille ?ede, &amp; gaf hit name, &amp; cald hit Chymoun; I ne wot why, ne what resoun. Sire Kay liuede nought but a stounde, He hadde so manye dedly wounde; Þey byried hym at an heremitage Bysyde Chymoun, at a passage. At Bayouse in Normandie Þey seide sire Beduer schulde þere lye; Þey biried hym at a kyrke name-couþ, Wyþoute þe ?ate toward þe souþ. To fflaundres þei bere þe erl Holdyn, In Tyrewane þei biried hym in; Sire Liger was boren to Boloigne. &amp; Arthur lefte in Burgoyne, Al þe wynter he dwelled þer-inne, &amp; tounes dide he manie bygynne; In somer he þoughte to Rome haue gon, ?yf he ne hadde lettyng of non. De Moddreto traditore. He was passed þe mountes pleyn, But Moddred dide hym turne ageyn. A day as he to þe mete went, Out of þis lond lettres were sent, &amp; right as his trumpes blewe, A messager þat he wel knewe, Þe lettres in his hand he leyde, &amp; til his owen mouþ he seyde, ‘Þat Moddred, his sister sone, ‘Had y-don hym gret tresone; ‘He had taken of þe lond homage, ‘&amp; leyd in casteles gret hostage; ‘?it wil he nought be þer-by, ‘But waiteþ þe more vileny: “Þy wif til hys hore haþ drawe, “Ageynes cristen mannes lawe; “&amp; Cheldryk, kyng of Germye, “Ys comen, &amp; brought gret partie; “By-?onde Humber, vntil Scotland, “Cheldrik haþ þat in his hand; “&amp; al þat langes vntil Kent, “Vntil Cheldrik gyue þey rent; “To holde wyþ Moddred wyþ his might, “Trouþe to-gydere haue þey plight. “Seuen hundred schipe lyn by þe stronde, “ffour score þousand þer come to londe “Of men of armes, wyþoute pytaille, “Ageyn þou comest, to gyue þe bataille.” When he had þus til Arthur teld, How Moddred no feyþ ne trouþe hym held, &amp; synfullyke had reysed stryf, His lond hym refte, for-leyn his wyf, He made his plainte to sire Oel, &amp; preide hym to kepe ilkadel Burgoyne &amp; ffraunce boþe wel; Til hym he tryste as to þe stel: “Toward Bretaigne y wil me spede, “Þe outlandeys wiþ me lede, “On Moddred wil y bataille bede, “&amp; take vengaunce of his misdede. “Lytel y preyse al my conquest “Þat y haue wonne in þys est, “?yf y now leue Bretayigne, my fe, “Bretayne myn heritage þat fel to be. “I schal me hye a-geyn to come; “On alle manere y wil to Rome.” He iorneyed þen fro land to land Til he come to Whitsand. He pleyned hym sore of Moddred, Þat fro his conquest had don hym fled. Arthul had purueid hym a flet, At Whitsand were þey in water set; Moddred herde wel þat tydyng, ‘By Whitsand cam Arthur þe kyng.’ Modred gadered his hostes to-gydere, Of hyse &amp; oþer þat come þydere; Arthur he hoped he durste abide, Wyþ-sette þe hauenes on ilka syde. Þe lond wolde nought Moddred lese, Ne repente, ne to þe pes chese; He wyste hym self so coupable, To aske þe pes hit was but fable. De bello inter Arthurum &amp; Modredum traditorem. Arthur dide his flete eft dight, To Romeneye þey redde þem right; But er þey were of schipes nomen, Er was Moddred a-geyn hym comen, &amp; letted hym to haue entre, Þey mighte nought come vp fro þe se. But Arthures men mighte wyþ trauaille; ffalse Moddred þey gonne assaille; &amp; he a-geyn was ful bold. ffor he hadde so siker hold, Arthures folk were more schent; ffor to þer schipes þey gaf þer tent To stere þem boþe fer &amp; hende, Þey tenden nought hem self to fende; Þey mighte hem nought fro arewes couere While þey stode on bankes ouer; Þer-fore were manie at meschef, &amp; þer lost was more gref. As þey to londe fro botes stirte, Many were slayn, &amp; fele were hyrte, &amp; mescheuously þen fel such cas Þat sire Wawayn slayn þer was, &amp; sire Agusel of Scotland By hym lay ded on his hand;— Þe soþe ne saw y write, ne how, Wheþer þat bowe or swerd hem slow;— &amp; manye oþere were slayn þore, Þat Arthur pleyned hem ful sore, But non by þe tenþe del As Wawayn &amp; Agusel: He had so mikel sorewe for þo Þat he þoughte in non oþer wo; Þeir sorewe myghte he neuere furgete; Siþen eet he neuere gladly mete. But whan his folk land had taken, A party gan his sorewe ouer schaken; Þen myghte Moddred haue no duree, Ne no fot helden his meynee; Þaw þey were fele, þey were nought prest, Þey had be norisched in pes &amp; rest, Þey couþe nought fighte, ne to-gydere wone, Ne at tyme stande ne schone, Als Arthures folk in werre couþe, Þat had hit vsed fro tyme of ?ouþe. De occisione gentis Moddredy. Þat ilke day at Romeneye Arþur dide manion deye Of Moddredes folk here &amp; þere, &amp; mo schulde, ?yf þe nyght ne were. Arthur sey þe day gan faille, He bod &amp; stynte his folk to taille; He gaf al tente til his owen conrey. Þat while fledde Moddred a-wey; Al þat night Moddred fledde To seke recet, but yuele he spedde; He wende Londone wolde hym receyue; Þey wold hym nought, but let hym weyue. Temese &amp; Londone he passed al, At Wynchestre þer tok he stal, Þere he herbergwed al a nyght Ageyn þer wille, al þorow myght; Of þe burgeys he tok feaute &amp; homage, al þeir maugre. De Sepultura Walwyny. Arthur wolde no soiour make, But Moddred wold he sle or take; But sorewe ful þough, did hym gret pyn, Of sire Gawayn his dere cosyn, &amp; Agusel þe Scottische kyng: Arthur made here byrying At Wybyry, þat ys in Walys; Þer lye þey boþe, seyþ Peres tales. Now comeþ al Arthures sorewe &amp; drede. To venge hym on þe false Moddrede, Day ne night ne wolde he blynne. To sege Wynchestre, Moddred wyþynne, He dide þe contre somoune al out, &amp; vmbyleide þe toun about. Þen sey Moddred he was in clos, &amp; byseged wiþ his fos; He þoughte þat ?yf he so longe lay, Wel schulde he nought wynne a-way, Þat nedly taken schuld he be, &amp; maugre hym ?elde þe cite. Among his men he made a cry, &amp; bad hem alle arme hem redy; Wyþ hym to fighte leuere he wylde Þan, his vnþankes, to þem ?elde. His men in bataille gan þem renge, &amp; wente right out hym for to venge; Þe parties sone to-gydere ran, &amp; lorn was þere þen many a man. Moddredes partie ?ede al doun, ffor his folk had no fuisoun; Hit was no wonder he hadde no grace, ffor traitour scholde nought spede in place. He sey his side no tyme ne spedde; ffor his misdede þe kyng he dredde; Hym self he þoughte algate to saue, Siþen he ne mighte no grace haue; His priues alle til hym he tok, Þo þat Arthur alle fursok, Þo þat Moddred hadde forþ brought, Þat neuere louede Arthur nought; Priuely wyþ hem he fledde a-wey, &amp; lefte þer al his oþer conrey. To Souþhaumptone he tok þe sty, &amp; huyred hym schipes al redy, &amp; swyþe anon þey gonne forþ saille; ffor drede he fledde til Cornewaille. Þo þat Moddred byhinde hym left, Alle were þey slayn, þer lyues reft, &amp; wan þe toun of þem ilkon; But wo was hym Moddred was gon. Sire Vrienes sone, Iwene he hight, Gentil of blod, and ful god knyght; Agusel cosyn was sire Iweyn, Þe reme of Scotland he gan to cleym, He left hit til Iweyn in herytage, &amp; Iweyn made Arthur homage. Iweyn had laught gret honour, Ageyn Moddred he stod in stour, &amp; dide &amp; seyde Moddred gret schonde, Þe while Arthur was out of londe. At ?ork to soiourne was þe quen, Scheo herde what wo hem was bytwen, Þat Moddred ne myghte in bataille dure, But euere was at desconfiture. Scheo þoughte scheo was þen mykel to blame ffor þe vylenye &amp; þe schame þat Moddred hadde brought hure inne, &amp; wyþ hym hadde y-leyn in synne, &amp; wedded hure ageyn þe lawe,— He ne lefte for kyng ne Godes awe,— Scheo hopede þat hit scholde yuele ende, Hure noble lord so foule to schende, &amp; hure self for euere y-schent. So mykel sorewe in herte scheo hent, Scheo fledde away out of þe toun To Walys, vntil Carlioun; Sch[eo] ?ald hure til þat nonnerye, &amp; tok þe veil for hure folye; Þer-inne was scheo hyd &amp; sperd, Þat noman of hure more herd. Moddred had sesed þen Cornewaille, ffor al Ingeland gan hym faille, &amp; sente aboute to landes sers After knyghte &amp; souders; Payen &amp; Cristen knyght of scheld, Alle þat wilde, at soud he held. He sente for Irysche &amp; Noreys; Þe Saxons come wyþ þe Daneys; ‘Þat hadde nought on to lyue, ‘Lond,’ he seyde, ‘he wolde hem gyue;’ He highte &amp; gaf to forthe his sped, As man byhoues þat haþ gret ned. But Arthur sore ouer þoughte ?yf he wiste what hym doughte; He dredde mykel his grete comynge, Payens among þe Crystene to brynge. Arthur wolde no lenger byde, But gadered folk on ilka syde Of alle þe contres heþen to Humber; fful manye þer were, as seys þe noumber. ?yf Arthur hadde lenger abiden, Þe sykerere myghte Moddred haue ryden. When þe kyng had folk ynow, Toward Cornewaille he hym drow, &amp; com in þer by þat cost Þer þat Moddred logged his host. Þen seide Moddred, ‘he wolde nought fle, ‘But abyde what chaunce so be; ‘He schulde er putte hym self to deye, ‘Er he wolde eft fle his weye.’ Moddred hadde fourty þousand, In a wode busched to stand By-syde a water, Tambre, y wene, Þat þe parties ran by-twene. Stronge were þe hostes, gret was þe hate, &amp; wrathe to-gydere dide þem abate. Þorow hate &amp; ire to-gydere þey ran, &amp; Payens loues no Cristen man; Þerfore þe bataille was merueillous, &amp; þe slaughter more hydous. On boþe partis were slayn fele, ffor þer non wolde oþer [forbere ne] spele. When Arthur sey Moddred feloun, He rod til hym wiþ gret raundoun; Byfore hym dide bere his dragoun, Moddred to smyte as a lyoun. Moddred he smot, &amp; he smot hym, On boþe partis were woundes grym. But Moddredes side gan misfalle, ffor he was slayn, &amp; his men alle; &amp; als was slayn þer y þat stour, Of þe Rounde Table þe faire flour,— Þe faire ?onglynges so mykel y-preised Þat Arthur had norisched &amp; vp reysed, Þat he had gadered of alle landes, Þe doughtiest þat were of handes;— &amp; Arthur hym seluen þore, Men seyþ, he was wounded sore; &amp;, for his woundes were to drede, Þer-fore he dide hym self lede In to þe Ilde of Aualoun. &amp; þus seys ilka Bretoun, Þat on lyue þere he ys, Lyuende man wyþ blod &amp; flesche, &amp; after hym ?ut þey lok. Maister Wace þat made þys bok, He seyþ namore of his fyn Þat doþ þe prophete Merlyn. Merlyn seide ful merueillouse, Þat Arthures deþ was dotouse; Þer-fore ?yt þe Bretons drede, &amp; seyn þat he lyues in lede; But y seye þey trowe wrong; ffor ?yf he now lyue, his lyf ys long; &amp; ?yf he lyue þys ilke day, He schal lyue for euere &amp; ay. Nought þan y trowe þe Bretons lye; He was so wounded, he moste dye. Nomina dominorum occissorum, tam ex parte Arthury, quam Moddredy. Þyse were þe lordes of renoun Þat on Moddredes side ?ed doun: Brumyng, Egbright, Elays, Cheldryk, Gyllarion, Syllatel, Gylomar, Gylopayk. Þo þat deyde on Arthures syde, Þat were lorn þat ilke tyde: Egbright of Norweye, Askyl of Denmark, Cador, &amp; Cassibolon, doughti men &amp; stark; &amp; many oþer lordes les þer lyf, Many lady wydewe, þat was wyf. Arthur was born til Aualoun I þe ?er of þe Incarnacion ffyue hundred, &amp; two &amp; fourty, Syn Iesu lyghte in virgyne Mary. But al þe roialme was in speyr, ffor of his body was non heyr. De Rege Constantino post Arthurum. But Cadores sone highte Constantyn Of Cornewaille, Arthures cosyn, He tok hym þe roiame in kepyng; Vntil he cam, bad hym be kyng. Of Moddred were two sones left, Þat þe lond wold hym haue reft; Proude men &amp; riche were þey; Þey seye þe force ?ede al awey, Þe gode knyghte þat þer ware, Were y-slayn, þe land was bare. Þey seye þat Arthur nought ne com; To haue drede þey nyste of whom; Þe newe kyng nought þey dredde, But gadered folk, &amp; hostes ledde,— Þo Saxons þat Moddred held, Þat ascaped vnslayn y þe feld,— To þem alle were ef[t] alyed; Þe kynges men ouer al þei spyed; Of Londone þat on sesed þe cite, &amp; þe beste of alle þe contre; Þat oþer, Wynchestre &amp; al þe schire, &amp; wende haue ben lord &amp; sire. Constantyn herde of þer estre, &amp; hyed hym ?erne vnto Wynchestre, &amp; in a kyrke he hym fond. ffor al þe kirke ne wolde he wond; Byfore þe auter seint Anfrybal His hed he smot of quitly al; And when þat on al þus was ded, On þat oþer, bataille he bed; But he ne durste nought hym abyde, In a kirke he gan hym hyde, But þat stod til hym no prow, ffor in þe kirke he hym slow. Þre ?er holy was he kyng; At Stonhenge he mad his endyng; ffor Conan his cosyn þere hym slow Treterously,—but y not how,— &amp; in þe same stede ys leyd, Wyþynne þe carole, þe story seyd. De Rege Conano. After hym was kyng his cosyn Conan, Þat was a folt, a mysproud man; Pes couþe he non ?eme his lyue, But suffrede his folk ay fighte &amp; striue. In cites was ay contek &amp; tene, Þe barons werrede þem by-twene; His men &amp; he were sonder saught, By stoundes often to-gydere faught; Hit semed wel he couþe no god, Syn he furdude his owen blod; Hys oþer Em tok wyþ werre &amp; wow, &amp; boþe his Emes sones he slow, ffor þey were righte heires of þe lond, Þat after hym self of blod men fonde; Þer-fore he was þe more to blame, Þat his owen blod so broughte to schame. ffour ?er he regned, &amp; in tresoun, &amp; deide in dampnacion; He regned &amp; dide,—his feble hap,— And after hym regned sire Vortap; In þe Latyn ys writen þus, Hys ryghte name ys Vortapus. De Rege Vortapo. In Vortapus time ryse Saxones To haue wonne þe lond eft sones: Þer chaunce was god in þeir rysy[n]ge, Gret skaþe þey dide vnto þe kynge. His secounde ?er his grace cam, &amp; hardinesse in herte he nam, Huyred souders, &amp; gaf þem wages, &amp; destruyed þe Saxons lynages, Þat non durste in his lond abide But þorow truage at terme &amp; tyde. ffour ?er he hadde þe lond in pees; At Londone he made his deces. De Rege Malgo. After hym cam his sone Malgo; Til alle manhede he gaf hym to; Alle men hadde of hym doute, He wan þe ildes ouer al aboute, &amp; of kynges he tok feaute, As whilom hit was woned to be; Of doughtinesse, of body feir, He lyknede his auncestre als heir; Of knyght-schipe noblely he proued; Alle his kynde ful wel he loued; Large he was, of ?yftes bolde; Tresor wolde he neuere holde; He let nought þat day to lyuen, But he had som what of his gyuen, Þat alle of hym were glad &amp; blythe, And þanked hym ful many syþe. His þrydde ?er was yuel to lyke, He vsed þe synne Sodomyke,— Þe synne of Sodome, as men fynde, Is a sinne ageynes kynde;— At Wynchestre, at his baþynge, Sodeynly mad he his endynge. De Rege Cariceo. After Malgo, Carice þei ches, A nyce þat louede no pes. ffor he was ai sorwful &amp; wroþ, Þer-fore was he alle men loþ. Þat herde þe Saxons he was gremande, &amp; þoughte he myghte nought dure ne stande. Ouer al aboute hym þey ros, &amp; oþer aliens, Bretons fos, Þat come wyþ Gormound by þe se side. Þe nauye of Gormound spredde ful wyde, He destruyed þe Bretons alle, &amp; þer name for euere dide falle, And þe name of þe lond [was] lorn, Þat highte Bretayne longe byforn: A þousand ?er byfore þe Incarnacioun Hight hit Bretaigne, for loue of Bretoun, Euere vntil Gormound cam; Þe name of Bretayne þenne a-wey nam. Listneþ now a litel pas, When Gormound cam, &amp; what he was: De Gormundo de Aufrico. Gurmound was a noble knyght, Of noble lynage, of mykel myght, Stalworþe of body, hardy of wille, He dredde noman for god ne ille; Kynges sone he was of Aufryk, Þat is in heþenesse a ful fer stryk; Of al Aufrike was he heyr, But þer-of ne tok he ward ne speir; ffor, Aufrik he gaf til his broþer, &amp; seide he wolde purchace hym oþer, He seide he wolde toward þe west, By þe se syde, to make conquest, &amp; croune wolde he neuere bere But he hit wan wyþ force &amp; were. Merlyn þe clerk longe byforn Of Gormound spak, er he was born, &amp; seide, ‘þe wolf vpon þe se ‘Schuld do alle þe Bretons fle:’ Þus seyde Merlyn wyþ herte ful sor, Þe Bretons tyme for euere mor, Til Cadwal &amp; til Conan Þeir bones broughte ageyn wyþ man. fful wel he cald hym ‘wolf of drede;’ He robbed oueral as he ?ede. He purchased hym, þorow robberye, Men ynowe, &amp; fair nauye,— An hundred &amp; sexti þousand bolde Of men of armes knowe &amp; tolde, Wyþouten gelde &amp; maryners, &amp; sergauntz, &amp; gode archers;— Schipes he hadde, y ne wot how fele; Alle he tok, &amp; non wold spele. Water &amp; lond, long &amp; brod, He ouer sailed, &amp; al þorow rode; Ildes þorow ?ede, kynges ouer-cam, Þeyr landes sesed, þer godes nam. So longe he ferde o þe se sailand, &amp; kynges slow by se &amp; sand, Al holy his flute gan dryue, Vpon Irland he gan aryue; Þe lond sone til hym gan falle; Irische kyng he dide hym calle; Þen seide he ‘he wolde to Bretaigne, ‘Wiþ Bretons to make a newe bargayne.’ Saxons were manie ?yt in þys lond, Þorow trewage þat men þem in bond, &amp; when þey felde hem ought of might, In Hengistes landes þey claymed right, Thwancastre, Lyndesye &amp; Kent, Of þyse Hengist furst hadde rent, &amp; þat he gaf Octa his sone,— By Scotland þer gan he wone;— Þey chalangede hit of auncestrie, Al þat was Hengistes partie; Ofte þey wan hit þorow dynt, &amp; often hit a-geyn þey tynt; Often þer-fore þey gaf hostages, &amp; also ofte made þey homages; To þe Bretons oþ þey swor, &amp; often ageyn þer oþ þey for; Neuere held þey lenger feyþ ne ryght Þan þey sey tyme &amp; terme of myght,— Þat a kyng was ded or doune, Or ?yf a feble on hadde þe croune;— Þenne þey ryse, on Bretons ronne, Vmwhile þey les, vmwhile þei wonne; ?yf a discord were bitwixt þe Bretons, Euere medlande were þe Saxons; On wham-so ros contek or wo, Þe Saxons were redy þeym to slo.

When he hadde al þat cost Brought to Cristendam al-most, Toward Rouchestre he tok his weye, Godes worde for to seye. Byside Rouchestre y þe londe, South est þethen, a folk he fond Þat to Godes werk gaf no tent, Ne no grace in þem non hent; But þere he stod þem to preche, &amp; þer sauacion for to teche, Byhynd hym on his cloþes þey henge, Righe tailles on a strenge. Qua de causa Anglici vocantur Caudati. When þey had don þat vyleny, Þey drof hym þenne wyþ maistri; ffer weys þey gan hym chace, Tailles þey casten in hys face. Þys holy man God bisought, ffor þey hym þat vileny wrought, Þat on þem &amp; on al þer kynde, Tailled, alle men schulde hem fynde. And God graunted al þat he bad, ffor alle þat kynde tailles had,— Tailles hadde, &amp; tailles haue; ffro þat vengaunce non may þem saue.— ffor þey wyþ tailles þe godeman schamed, ffor tailles al Englische kynde ys blamed; In manie sere londes seyd, Of þo tailles we haue vmbreyde. When þys godeman was þenne ascaped,— Þe schame to haue, þer kynde ys schaped— Til o valeye he fledde þo fyle[s], ffro Rouchest[r]e hit ys manie myles; Bytwyxt two valeyes to þe northe west, At a hil he gan hym rest.

But Ihesu Crist wolde hit nought; He spak til hym, for he so þought: “Let al þat þought ilkadel, “&amp; trist opon myn help right wel! “Þou art my seriaunt, &amp; paies me; “Þy þought &amp; dede, wel y hit se; “Of mi grace to þe y graunte, “Þat þow dost, y holde couenaunte; “Heuen ys open to þe redy, “And for wham þou askest merci.” When seint Austyn had sen &amp; herd God of heuene þat hym answerde, He þanked hym of his swete grace, An[d] kneled doun in þat place, &amp; kyste þe erthe fele sithe; He grette for ioie, so was he bliþe. When he had longe preied &amp; gret, Doun y þe erthe his staf he set; Þer right as he sey þat sight, He pighte his staf þer doun vpright: &amp; þer of þe erthe a water spronge Þat ys now a ryuer longe, &amp; neuere byforen was non sen, Ne no man wonyng had þer ben; ffor noman mighte liue ne dwelle Wyþoute ryuer or water of welle; &amp; for þer was non neuer byforn, Was þe contre wast &amp; lorn.

Cadwalyn was ofte on fflote Wyþ many fair[e] schip on schote, &amp; wel þe wynd gan hym dryue Vp vntil þys lond to arryue; But euere Edwyn cam hym byforn, Þat his trauaile was euere lorn, &amp; al was þorow þe clerkes engyn, Þat warned ay þe kyng Edwyn.

Þe kyng comaunded til Brian— He nadde non oþer leches man— Þat he schulde seke hym venisoun, Or hys iuel schulde brynge hym doun: “But ?yf þat y som venison haue, “No þyng so sone may me saue; “Hit ys no tale wher-of hit be, “But þat þou mightest gete hit me.” De gratitudine Briany. Brian hadde ful gret longyng ffor to saue his em þe kyng, &amp; took þo men þat were wont Go to chace, &amp; ?ede to hont. Þey soughte þe dales &amp; þe playnes, Þey soughte busche &amp; montaynes, &amp; þorow mores &amp; þorow lynde: ffond þey neuere hert ne hynde, Ne wilde bor, ne bukke ne do, Ne hare, cony, ffowen, no ro. Þen hadde Brian sorewe ynow, &amp; seide, “how schal myn em fare, how, “Þat y may no venison fynde?” But he dide als a man ful kynde; He schar a pece out of his þe, &amp; lardid &amp; rostoid, as fel to be, &amp; dightit for þe kyng right wel, &amp; he et hit ilk a del, And passed wel þo þat hache; So swete a mete neuer or et he. When þe kyng felte hym of might, Þer schipes alle to þe se he dight, &amp; aryued vp at a toun— ‘Achidalet’ was þe name Breton; ?yt men seyþ after þe flod Men knowes þere þe toun stod.— Þe kyng welcomed Cadwalyn, &amp; ofte compleyned his mikel pyn; &amp; his in, to make soiour, He dide hym haue at grete honur; &amp; hight hym ‘he schulde in a stounde ‘Helpym to brynge Edwyn to grounde: “But certes, meruaille y haue “Þat grete Bretayne may ?e nought saue. “fful wel kept hit Sire Belyn, “&amp; Maximian &amp; Co[n]stantyn, “And Lucius dide vs Cristen be,— “But Arthur ys ded, wel may men se,— “Þey lore neuere a foot of land. “Myn heritage y holde in hand; “So woldy þat þou didest þyn “Ageyn þe Englische paen Edwyn.” Cadwalyn seide sire Salamon, “Oure kynde conqueste is longes gon. “Wite þou wel þo conquerrours “Were myn auncestres &amp; ?ours, “&amp; ve[n]iaunce fel on many of þo, “Þat of þer blod cam na mo: “On riche men hit [is] a veniaunce, “Childre to gete þat haue no chaunce; De translacione nature Brytonum. “Þenne goþ heritage out of kynde; “When nought of þe blod men fynde, “Þen schul men gyue hit for good “To þem þat han hated al þe blod.

De Briano. In þys þat þey made purueaunce, Bryan seyde ‘he wolde o chaunce ‘Til Ingelond wende priuely, ‘?yf he by sleyghte [Pellith] mighte come by; “ffor also longe as he ys on lyue, “In Ingelond may we neuere arryue; “ffor he can telle þorow his art, “Whider we wile, &amp; to what part.” Bryan auntred hym al in drede, But God hym gaf wel for to spede. At Barbeflet to schipe he went, At Southaumptone hauene he hent; ffaire cloþes wolde he non were, But dightym al lyke to a beggere; A schort staf he dide hym make, Als palmeres in handes take, &amp; dide þer-inne a wel longe pyk Squar grounden, scharp, euenlyk; He feyned hym croked many a tyme, As he hadde longe ben a pylgrime; He let hym al[s] he had ben wery, &amp; al-wey spirde priuely; After þe kyng he spird vm-while, ffor non hoped til hym no gyle. So queyntely aboute hym wond, Þe kynges court at ?ork he fond; He dide hym þere among þe poraille, Wyþ bagge &amp; burdon of þeir entaille; Wyþ hem he stod, wiþ hem he wente, But euere his eye o syde he glente; He saw his sister wyþ a bacyn, Water for to feche þer-in. &amp; Brian stirt forþ in hure weye, &amp; stille seide þat he wolde seye.

Al þat ilke day he sculked, Among þe pouere men he hulked; When þe night cam, he was ful fayn, His wey he tok to þe south a-gayn.

Of þat bode þe kyng was paied, His wendyng was nought delayed; Night &amp; day made hym redy; Ten þousand he hadde til his nauy, What of hise owen, &amp; of ffrendes Þat kyng Salamon wiþ hym sendes.

Penda, þe kyng of Lyndeseye, How Bryan dide, he herde wel seye; Gret force of folk Penda dide fet, Cadwalyn for to wyþ-set. Oxenforde he byseged aboute, But Brian heldym wel wyþoute. When Cadwalyn was ryued on lande, Til hym cam ful smert tydande ‘Þat an Englische kyng Penda ‘Byseged Bryan, &amp; was his fa.’ Cadwalyn was al an-ired; To rescowe Brian he desired; Als faste as he mighte, he hasted; Iornes to make, folk he tasted; &amp; when he was þe toun ought ney, He bad þem reste þat were wery: “Rest ?ou now for ?oure trauaille; “Þe smertloker ?e may assaille.” Þe folk of Oxenforde were glade Of þe ioye þat Brian made; Gret ioie þer was, he was so ner, &amp; more of his grete power.

Þat tyme was many a man þer tynt; Hertly were þey halden waken; And Penda, maugre hym, was taken, And smertly don in syker hold; ffor no raunsom might he be sold, Ne for no man loþ ne leue, But he wolde to Cadwalyn cheue, &amp; holde of hym his heritage, &amp; don hym feaute &amp; homage. When Penda hadde to Cadwalyn Obliged hym, &amp; mad his fyn; More loue to make, &amp; bate stryfe, Pendas sister he tok to wyfe, And wedded hure on Cristen lawe. To god migh[t] noman Penda drawe; As was Penda yuel in dede, As telleþ þe boke of seint Bede. Cadwalyn þanked his barons, &amp; nameliche of þe Bretons, Of al þer trauaille &amp; al þer ylle Þat þey had þoled wiþ gode wille; Al he schulde auaunce þer lore Þat þey had lost for hym byfore; &amp; alle þo þat dide hym noye, Of hem he gan ful faste destruye; He passed þe Humber wyþ folk ynow, Tounes brente, &amp; men he slow.

Dame Ethelburgh highte þat oþer, Þe kyng of Kent was hure broþer, Sire Ethelbright hure fader was, Þat we byforn han rad in pas. Seint Bede spekeþ of þys Edwyn, Syn he fursok þe lawe Sarazyn, So god a Cristen kyng was non In al þis lond als he alon; He was cristned o þe Pasche day, At ?ork fursok his Paen lay; Syx hundred ?er þe date was þo, &amp; passed seuene &amp; twenty mo; Emfled, his doughter born, Sche was cristned a ?er byforn. Whan he þe Cristendam þoughte take, Þe kirke of ?ork he dide first make; But longe er hit was brought til ende, He was slayn wyþ folk vnhende; But seint Osewald, þat gode man, He ended þat Edwyn bygan. Sire Edwyn was syx ?er Cristen kyng in þys lond her: What cristen, what heþen þral, Seuentene ?er he regned in al; Þat selue ?er Oswy was slayn, His cosyn Osfry y þe same payn, Þe ?eres of Crist six hundred wore, &amp; þrytty ?er, &amp; þre more; Þe ferþe day þat ys y þe ides Of Octobre, ho so hit bydes.

Seint Bede blames Cadwalyn; Of wille he calles hym ‘barbaryn,’— ‘Barbaryn’ ys a Sarazyn straunge, To mercy þat wil nere turne ne chaunge;— ffor al þe werd, so ferde he, On lyue wolde he non let be. Þat slaughter lasted so gret stounde, Vnneþes a Cristen man men founde, But turnde vnto þe lawe Paen, Þat er was brought to be Cristen, Vnto þe tyme of seint Osewalde, Þat þe feiþ a-geyn dide halde; Vnto þe reame he hadde right, And was ful fre, &amp; gentil knyght; He sente for þe bischop Aydan, Of Scotland was þat gode man; Þat bischop cam, his folk to preche, Þer Cristendam fro Paen wreche.

Dixit Aydanus: ‘non in- ‘ueteras- ‘cat illa ‘manus.’ Aydan sey how þe kyng hit brak; Þer-fore til hym þys word he spak: “Nere mote þat hand rote ne elde, “But hol wyþouten ende to welde.” &amp; so hit ys right als he seyde; In schryne at Peterburgh is hit leyde; At þe abbeye, in þe kirke, Þe kyng Penda dide hit wirke. Oswald was sib Edwyn byforn; Of Acha his sister was Osewald born; Þer-fore Cadwalyn wilde nought sesse, But faste on Osewald werre gan presse; To Scotland he chased Osewold. ffor Cadwalyn had more folk, &amp; bold, Osewald fledde, &amp; gaf hym place, So þat Cadwalyn left hys chace; His folk hym þoughte trauailled sore, But Penda at þat tyme was þore; He bad hym folewe, Osewald to take, Or don hym þe lond for-sake. When Osewald wyste þe certeyn, Þat Cadwalyn was turnd ageyn, Ageyn Penda wolde he stande, ffor hym nold he be fleande. In a feld Osewald gan byde, To bide þe bataille what so bytyde;— ‘Heuene-feld’ þe name ys cald, ffor þe loue of seint Osewald;— In þat feld a crois he lyft, &amp; bad þem alle nought be aglift, But come &amp; knele byfore þe crois, And Iesu preye al wyþ o voys, “Þat he þys day stand vs by, “A-geyn Penda, Godes enemy, “Þat wyþ wrong vs onoyes, “&amp; our Cristen men destruyes.” Alle þey dide as Osewald bad, &amp; preyde Ihesu, þat his blod schad On þe croys for mannes nede, ‘Ageyn Penda wel þat day spede.’ Alle were þey of gode repentaunce, &amp; wel y-schryuen for alle chaunce. Syn þey dight hem to þe bataille, &amp; Penda gan hem faste assaille: His host was gret, &amp; wyde y-spred; Ner were þey slayn, &amp; Penda fled. Penda ascaped wyþ mykel pyn, &amp; pleyned hym vnto Cadwalyn, &amp; seide, ‘bot he venge hym wolde, ‘Of hym schuld he namore holde.’ At þat tyme þus hit byleft Vntil þey samned þer hostes eft: Þe bataille was byside þyrlwal, Þat whilom closed þe northende al; &amp; þere was many myracle schewed, Þat witnesseþ boþe lered &amp; lewed; Þe cros dide þere many merueilles, Halp man &amp; best of þeir trauailles.

Of þo men þat þys word herd, A byword in al þe contre ferd, “God haue our soules! quaþ Osewold.” Þys byword was longe y-told, Þys þey seide at ilka rage, &amp; longe had þey hit in vsage: Þis word witnesseþ wel seynt Bede, Þat longe was vsed in many lede. Nyne wynter was he kyng, &amp; eighte &amp; þritty ?er was ?ynge; Þe date of Crist ys told redy, Six hundred ?er, &amp; two &amp; fourty. Þyse wikkede kynges þat hym slow, Dide henge his lymes on a bow; A tre þey dide sette þer fore; Handes, armes, þey dide þorow bore; De Rege Osewy Hys heued heng a ?er to mone; But Oswy, his broþer, sone Was kyng, &amp; tok þe hed hengand, &amp; biried hit at ffarnelland; Of an ilde hit ys þe name, To Durem langes þat same.

Þo þat þer were, conseil þey held, &amp; bitaughte Osewy þe scheld. Osewy saw þe folk al pouere, &amp; þe land at no recouere; Þe power of Cadwalyn was mikel, &amp; Penda poyned hym als a prykel; He sey his power ne was nought ?yf Cadwalyn werre on hym sought; Leuer hym were in loue to bowe, Þat þey namo of his men slowe, Þan in werre bere hym ouer heye, &amp; euere be on þe werre partye. Til Cadwalyn his sonde he sent, Þat he wolde com til parlement; And þyder cam he al wyþ leue, ffor Cadwalyn wold hym nought greue. He gaf hym boþe seluer &amp; gold ffor Cadwalyn schold ben hym hold, &amp; he receiued his homage, &amp; som restored of his damage. Al þus þe pes was þer y-graunted, &amp; in loue longe haunted; But Oswy mikel kynde hadde, Þat often conseilled þem &amp; radde ffor to werre vpon Osewy, Þey cleymed of hys land gret parti; But Osewy defended hym als a man, So þat of hym neuere þey ne wan.

When Penda hit perseiued, he made gret fare ffor þat Osewy was nought þare: To Cadwalyn he made his pleynt, &amp; seide ‘Osewy was fals &amp; feynt, “Syn he cam nought for þy somons “To þy court, als oþer barouns. “Alle ar þey comen, ilka Bretoun, “&amp; ilkan Englische &amp; Saxoun; “But Osewy tok þy somons in veyn, “To come to court he hadde disdeyn.” Þe kyng excused hym curteysly: “He haþ som gret encheson why; “Perauenture he haþ som syknesse “Or oþer greuaunce þat makeþ hym stresse.” “Nay,” seide Penda, “hit ys nought so! “Þou sest nought what Osewy wil do! “In þys tyme of þy corounement, “In-til Saxoyn haþ he sent “After souders, as was me told, “To venge þe deþ of Osewold. “When he seþ tyme þat he may, “On þe to renne he wile assay. “But, Cadwalyn, wil þou giue me leue, “I schal hym brynge til a mescheue, “Þat eyþer schal y don hym fle, “Or quik or ded bryng hym to þe.” Seide Cadwalyn, “þus may hit make; “Neþeles y schal conseil take.” He calde þe Bretons hym aboute, And dide Penda go wyþoute, &amp; þe Englische euerychone; So þe Bretons left al-one.

Þen was þys lond wast al left, Moryne &amp; hunger þe folk had reft; Enleuen ?er, þus wryten þey fond, Was her no folk might tile þe lond, But ful fewe of þe Bretons, &amp; also fewe of þe Saxons; ffor al þe folk wyþ tempest vnkynde Were slayn, þat non mighte men fynde. De multiplicacione Saxonum, &amp; edificacione eorum per loca. When þys tempest sessed was, &amp; fele ?eres passed hard pas, Þe Saxons vntil Saxoyne sent, &amp; þey were fayn, &amp; þyder went. Þey aryuede in Northumber-land, Þe moste of þer kynde þere þey land. ffro Scotland vntil Cornewaille, Al þe lond gan þey taille;— Logres hit highte a wel god þrowe, ffor Loqeryn þat we in Ingeland knowe; But Bretayne was, by elde tales, Engelond, Scotland, &amp; Wales; Al o land, al was o name; Of þys matere y telde þe same.— Was þer non here þat letted þer weye, Ne þer takynge wolde wyþ-seye; ffor of þe Bretons were left but fo, Or any þat were yborn of þo, &amp; þo skulked to wodes &amp; fennes, To Cornewaille þey fledden hennes; In to Walys þey fledden also; Of Bretons kynde were left namo. At þys tyme þat y here mene, Þe Bretons passed out quit &amp; clene, &amp; Englische made her þeyr byggynge, &amp; ches þeym of þeyr kynde a kyng. Þyse Saxons þat hyder camen, Loue &amp; pees þey held ay samen; Þe lond to tyle, oueral þey sought, Cites, casteles, tounes, wrought, &amp; made houses, &amp; tilede þe feld, Þer vsages &amp; þer lawes held; Þat þey in Saxoyne helde byfore, Þe same wolde þey haue þore. Þe tounes names on þeir langage Held þey after þeir lynage; Þe erldames &amp; þe baronyes, On þeir vsage made partyes; &amp; somme þey helde on Bretons manere; Longe had þey seyn hit byforn here. Of pes þey made good sykernesse, Þe lond to tyle wyþ more &amp; lesse. Whenne þyse Englische were oueral spred, In fele stedes stored &amp; fed, &amp; þe folk was wel y-mored, And þe land bettere a-stored, Hit was er a wel good þrowe, As mannes in-wyt may þat wel knowe. Cadwaladrus hym by-þought, Þat in to Bretaigne for hunger sought; By passagers wel herde he seye Þe venimouse eyr was al a-weye; Gretynge he preied þe kyng Aleyn His kyndam to geten hym a-geyn; &amp; als he hadde bysought hym so, On þe night a voys cam hym to, And seide, “lef now at my biddynge, “Til hit be schewed wyþ toknyng. “Of Bretayne God haþ ordeyned þys, “&amp; gyuen hit haþ to þe Englische. “Þe Bretons kynde schal namore “In þat lond make wonynge þore, “Til þat tyme come þat ys auysed, “Þat Merlyn til Arthur prophetysed: “He seyde, ‘þat þe folk of Breton, “‘Er domesday schulde hit be don, “‘Þat þey schul haue þys lond ageyn, “‘When fulfild ys þe terme certeyn.’” He bad hym, “he schulde go to Rome, “To þe Pope, &amp; take his dome, “Þe forte assoille, penaunce to drye; “Among þe seyntes þer schaltow lye— “Þe prophesie schal nought falle— “Til þe Bretons brynge þy bones alle “Out of Rome to þys Bretayne, “Þen schul þey haue þys lond agayne.” Hit schal bytide swilk a weys, Right as seint Methodye seys, Þat many an holy bon of pris Þat y þys tyme in ffertre lys, Schal men take, &amp; a-wey lede Out of þe ffertres, for Paen drede; &amp; so schul his bones be brought; What tyme hit schal be, wyte we nought. Cadwaladres, when he þys herde, Als a man in dwale he ferde; Stoneyed he was a wel god þrowe, Er þan he couþe hym self y-knowe. At þe laste, þer-of he brak, &amp; til þe kyng Alayn he spak, And teld hym what þe vois had seyd, &amp; what toknyng for hym was leyd. Gret wonder hadde þe kyng Aleyn, &amp; wilned faste to wyte þe certeyn; His wyse clerkes he dide forþ calle, &amp; dide þem seke þer bokes alle ‘To wyte what þe prophesie[s] ‘Mente &amp; seide in sere partyes, ‘?if þey acorded til þat selcouþ ‘Þat Cadwaladres seide wiþ mouþ.’ De propheciis Aquile, Sibillie, &amp; Merlyny. Þey soughte þe prophesies of Aquilee, At Chestre was hit seid schuld be; Sybiles sawes forþ þey leyd, &amp; what þe clerk Merlyn had seyd, And þe sawes of Sephonye, Of whiche non ne wolde lye; But þey acorded alle til on, Þe voys &amp; þer bokes ilkon; Non seide seer for to blame, But as þe vois þey seide þe same. To Cadwaladrus seide Aleyn þe kyng, “I conseille þe to fulfulle þat þyng. “Syn God of heuene haþ seid hit so, “His wille, y rede, þat ?e do: “ffor couetyse of no lond, “To don his wille ne schaltow wond.” Cadwaladre bad Iuor his sone, &amp; Iny his neuew, “wende &amp; wone “In to Bretaigne, &amp; meintene efte “Þo þat were of Bretons lefte, “Þat þey ne lese þat er was myn, “Þeyr fredam, for no Barbaryn.” (A barbaryn, as seyþ seint Bede, Ne had neuere merci for no nede.) Cadwaladres al þys world fursok, To God &amp; to penaunce hym tok. To Rome þen wente Cadwaladrus, Vnto þe Pope Sergius, Þat receyued hym wyþ mikel wynne, &amp; til hym he schrof his synne, Wyþ wyl of herte þat he myght mene; &amp; þe Pope assoillede hym clene. In langour lay he many a day, &amp; deyde þe twelfte kalende of May; Þe date of Crist was euen in lyne, Sex hundred ?er, four score &amp; nyne; &amp; his soule wente to blis, Þe body at Rome ffertred ys. Þanke we God þat grace hym gaf! Þyse vers are his epitaf: Culmen, opes, sobolem, pollencia Regna, triumphos, Exuuias, proceres, menia, castra, lares, Queque patrum virtus, et que congesserat ipse, Cadwal armipotens liquit amore Dei; Vt Petrum, sedem-que Petri, Rex cerneret hospes, Cuiusfonte meras sumeret almus aquas, [&amp;c.] Now haue we told of þe Bretons, Of kynges, &amp; of somme barons, How þey mayntened þys lond Syn Brutes tyme þat first hit fond, Vntil Cadwaladrus tyme. Of Bretons þere leue we to ryme, &amp; now of Englische wil we telle, Syn þe Bretons here gan dwelle, Þat toke þe lond þorow Godes heste: Þeyr tyme we calle al ‘Englische geste’; Al ys cala geste Englische’ Þat on þis langage spoken ys. ffrankysche speche ys cald Romaunce, So sey þis clerkes &amp; men of ffraunce. Peres of Langtofte, a chanoun Schauen y þe hous of Brydlyngtoun, On Romaunce al þys story he wrot Of Englishe kynges, as we wel wot, He wrot þer dedes alle þat þey wrought; After hym in Englische y hit brought; Of his meninge y wot þe weye, But his fair speche can y nought seye; I am nought worþy open hys bok, ffor no conninge þer-on to lok, But for to schewe his mykel wyt, On my spekynge þat ys but skyt, How he was queynte in speche, &amp; wys, Þat swiche a bok made of pris, And gadered þe stories alle til on, Þat neuere er was mad for non. When Peres first bygan his werk, He bisoughte an holy clerk To gyue hym grace wel to spede,— Þat holy man highte seint Bede,— flor in his bokes mykel he fond; He made ffyue bokes of Engelond, And y schal prey hym þat ilke weys, Als he ys corseint &amp; curteys, He gyue me grace wel to seye, &amp; rightly þys in rym to leye, Þys story þat ys seyd þorow Peres, Þat alle be payed þat hit heres. Amen!</field>
