      <field name="fulltext">O Vita! misero longa, fælice breuis. To The Right worshipfull, Sir Philip Sidney Knight, indued with al perfections of learning, and titles of Nobilitie: Thomas Lodge Gen. wisheth continuance of honour, and the benefits of happie Studie. BARNABE RICH Gentleman Souldier, in praise of the Author. If that which warnes the young beware of vice, And schooles the olde to shunne vnlawfull gaine, If pleasant stile and method may suffice, I thinke thy trauaile merits thanks for paine, My simple doome is thus in tearmes as plaine: That both the subiect and thy stile is good, Thou needs not feare the scoffes of Momus brood. If thus it be, good Lodge continue still, Thou needst not feare Goose sonne or Ganders hisse, Whose rude reportes past from a slaundrous quill, Will be determind but in reading this, Of whom the wiser sort will thinke amis, To slaunder him whose birth and life is such, As false report his fame can neuer tuch. IOHN IONES GENTLEMAN, in praise of the AVTHOR. Though not my praise, yet let my wish preuaile, Who so thou be that list to read this booke, I neuer yet by flatterie did assaile, To count that good that most did please my looke. But alwaies wisht my friends such stile to vse, As wise might like, though foolish would refuse. In opening vice my friend who spends his time, May count by priuate good no profit lost, What errors scape in young and lustie prime, Experience (badge of truth) may quickly cost. Who sets the marke, that makes men shunne the sand, Deserues good words, his proofes for profit stand. For common good to crosse a few mens vaines, Who like to Midas would that all were golde, I count not misse, since there vnlawfull gaines Makes some men sink, whom birth might well vphold. I know the sore, the scarre is seene to plaine, A blessed state where no such wils doo raine. In briefe, I praise this booke for pretie stile, For pithie matter, Gentle be thou iudge, O would my wish some fancies might beguile, Then faire reuenewes should not fit a snudge. A world to see how Asses daunce in golde, By wanton wils, when Gentles starue for colde. Whose errors if it please succeeding age, To see with sighs, and shun with sad aduice, Let him beholde this booke, within whose page, Experience leaues her chiefest proofes of price, And thanke the youth that suffered all these toiles, To warne thee shun that rocke which many spoiles. FINIS. THE DELECTABLE Historie of Forbonius and Prisceria. The Turtle pleased with his she compeare, With sweet aspects, and many a turning lure, Describes the zeale in tearmes should well appeare, If nature were so gratious to assure The silly bird with speech as well as I: Who stopt of speech by turnes my woes descrie. And though perhaps my tearmes by distance be, Seaioynd from thee: I wis my mournfull mone, Doth pearce thine eares, and Eccho tells for me, In sowre reports: would she and I were one. For whom I liue, and whom I onely loue, Whose sweet aspects my dying fancies moue. And if the aire by yeelding calme consent. Make sweet Prisceria priuie to my suite, Vouchsafe deere sweet, that beautie may relent, And graunt him grace, whom distance maketh mute: So either hope shall make me climbe the skie, Or rude repulse enforce my fancies flie. Amidst these Mountaines on a time did dwell, A louely shepheard who did beare the bell. For sweete reports and many louing layes: Whom while he fed his flocke in desart wayes, A netheards daughter deckt with louely white, Behelde and loude the lasse Corinna hight. Him sought she oft with many a sweete regard, With sundrie tokens she her sutes preferd, Her care to keepe his feeding flocke from stray, Whilst carelesse he amidst the lawnes did play. Her sweete regards she spent vpon his face, Her Countrie cates she sent to gaine his grace, Her garlands gaie to decke his temples faire, Her doubled sighs bestowd on gliding aire, Her pleasant kisse where she might steale a touch, Corinnas zeales to Corulus was such. He wanton shepheard glorying in her sute, These signes of zeale to folly did impute: Not waying of her many louing sightes, Her watrie eyes, her secret moane by nights: Her carelesse comfort in her fruitfull ewes, Her monefull Aeglogs full of carefull shewes, But scorning that, (which might that Godhead moue, Who in a shepheards forme, for Ioues behoue, Did charme the watchman of the heifer faire, For whose behoofe the thunder left the aire.) He left the place where she did loue to bide, And draue his flocke another way beside. Whose dire disdaine (the God that kindles loue, And makes impressions straungly from aboue Misliking) strake with fancie at that stower, The silly shepheard wounded by his power. Now sought for that which he tofore did shun, And now the heat of fancie first begun, To straine a yeelding in his restlesse minde: Such are the wounds that passe from fancie blinde, That Corulus will now Corinna wee, Though earst he loathd and scorned so to dooe. Now she that sought with many a sweete aspect, Is sude to now by him that did neglect. Now bountifull is sweete Corinnas grace, Now like the Sunne in welkin shines her face, Her eyes like Gemini attend on loue, Her stately front was figured from aboue, Her daintie nose of Iuorie faire and sheene, Bepurfurate with ruddie roses beene. Her cherie lips doth daunt the morning hiew, From whence a breath so pleasant did insew, As that which laide faire Psiches in the vayle, Whome Cupide woode and woed to his auayle. Within the compasse of which hollowe sweete, Those orient ranks of siluer pearles doe meete, Prefiring lyke perfection to the eie, As siluer colde amidst the summers skie: For whence such wordes in wisdome couched be, As Gods from thence fetch their Philosophie: Her dimpled chin of Alablaster white, Her stately necke where nature did acquite Her selfe so well, as that at sodaine sight, She wisht the worke were spent vpon her selfe, Her cunning thus was showde vpon the shelfe: For in this pile was fancie painted faire, In either hand an asure pipe she bare: By one repeating many a sweete consent, By other comfort to the heart she sent. From which a seemely passage there doth show, To strangers pleasures that are plast alow, Like to the forrowe Phaeton did leue, Amidst the welkin when he did receiue, His Fathers charge, and set the world on fire: In this faire path oft paced sweete desire, At euerie turne beholding with delight, That Marble mount that did affect the sight. Of virgins waxe the sweet impression was, The cunning compasse thereof did surpasse, For art concluding all perfections there, Wrote this report, All graces bideth here. Which Cupide spying built his mansion so, As scorning those swæte graces to bestoe On mortall man, with bowe ibent doth waite, Least Ioue should steale impressions by deceit. And wondring at the crisped coment faire, In thought concludes it meeter for the aire Then mortall mould: next which the stately thies, Like two faire compast marble pillers rise, Whose white dooth staine the daintie driuen snow: Next which the knees with lustie bent below Conioynd with nerues and cords of Amber sweete, This stately pyles with gladsome honour greete, Such stately knees as when they bend a lite, All knees doo bend and boow with strange delyght. Her calues with stranger compasse doo succeed, In which the asures streames a wonder breede, Both art and nature therein laboured haue, To paint perfection in her coulours braue, Next which, the pretie ground worke of the pile, Doth shew it selfe and wonder doth beguile, The ioyntes whereof combind of Amber sweete, With corall cords, yeeld bent to seemely feete. From which, whose lift to lift his gasing eye, Shall greater cause of wonder soone espie. When on the backe he bends his wauering looke, In which the worke and taske Diana tooke, When with Arachne for the prise she straue, Both art and nature there excelled haue. Where from Pigmalions image seemely white, Where close conueiaunce passing Gordians plight, Where louely Nectar drinke for all the Gods, Where euerie grace is stained there by ods. Will not content with gasing looke for more, And spie those armes that stand his sight before, Which for their mould the Aegyptian wonders passe, Which for their beautie staine the Christall glasse, Which in their motion maister natures sweete, Where blushing streames present a secrets meete, Will now amazde, conclude at last of this, That in the hands all grace concluded is. Where Nature limits euer fatall time, Where Fortune figures pleasure in her prime, Whence spred those fingers tipt with Iuorie, Whose touch Medusas turne may well supplie, Where to conclude as now the shepheard deemes All grace all beautie, all perfections seemes. Thus Corulus with many secret thoughts, Diuines on her whom erst he set at naughts: And forst by scorch of inward shrowded fire, He seekes for her his fancie did require. Who fraught with woes in secret shrewdes renude, Her silent griefe vnsure of that insude. Her Corulus with warie search at last At sodaine found: and as a man agast At that he saw, drew backe with feare, and than Remembring of his woes his sute began: O sweete Corinna blessed be the soyle That yeelds thee rest amidst thy dayly toyle, And happie ground whereon thou satest so: Blest be thy flocke, which in these lawnes doo go, And happie I, but hauing leaue to looke: Which said, with feare he pawsd, and bloud forsooke His palie face, till she that wrought the fire, Restorde the red, and kindled sweete desire. And with a bashfull looke beholding him, Which many months her pleasant foe had bin: She cast her armes about his drooping necke, And with her daintie fingers dawde him vp. And kissing of his palie coloured face, (Like as the Gods) by touch did soone displace The sowre, that alterd the poore shepheards sweete, When thus she gan her Corulus to greete: O louely shepheard happie be the hower, In which (I know not by what secret power) The Gods haue sent thee hether to thy frend, Alas what griefe should Corulus offend? Whom fairest Nimph might well a liking lend. Thy grasing Ewes with vdders full of milke, With fruitfull sleece and wooll as softe as silke, Take glory in the fatnesse of this soyle And praise theyr Mastres care and busie toyle: And now accuse thee of thy drooping mone, Tis but enough for me to wayle alone For why Corinna onely haplesse is. Poore Corulus at last reuiude by this, Gan sighing silence now to interrupt And banish feare which did his hope corrupt. And thus he said: O Nimph of beauties traine, The onely cause and easer of my paine: Tis not the want of any worldly ioy, Nor fruitlesse breed of Lambes procures my noy, Ne sigh I thus for any such mishap: For these vaine goods I lull in fortunes lap. But other greefes and greater cause of care, As now Corinna my tormenters are. Thy beautie Goddesse is the onely good, Thy beautie makes mine eyes to streame a flood, Thy beautie breakes my woonted pleasant sleepe, Thy beautie causeth Corulus to weepe: For other ioyes they now but shadowes be, No ioye but sweete Corinnas loue for me. Whereon I now beseech thee, by that white Which staines the lilly, and affects my sight, By those faire locks whereas the graces rest, By those sweete eyes whereas all pleasures nest: Doo yeelde me loue, or leaue me for to die. Corinna studious for to yeeld reply, With many teares bedewd the shepheards face, And thus at last she spake: O happie place. The which the Gods appoynted for my good. What blessed Nimph within this sacred wood Hath pleaded poore Corinnas lawfull cause? Or be they dreames that now my fancie drawes? O Corulus ne readst thou sue to me, Nor spend the teares for to accepted be, Since long ere this I would haue bent to bow, If modest feare could well haue taught me how. In happie bonds of Himen I am thine: Ne plead thou grace to her that dooth incline. Thus with a kisse she sealed vp the deed: When as the shepheard glad of happie speed Embracing her he had desired long, Gan call for grace to her he so did wrong. Confirmed thus with mutuall glad consent, They finisht vp the marriage that they ment. Great was the day, and euery field compeere Delighted in the pleasure of his deere. Poore I alone in sad lamenting layes, Depriued of the pleasure of my dayes, In carefull tunes in briefe concluding thus: O happie times and planets gracious. When in a mirrour beautie did behold The hidden woes, my muse could wel vnfold: And with a liking looke shape some replie. But woe is me, since fathers crueltie In changed formes hath altred termes of sute, And altering place hath made my Goddesse mute. Who honouring Pan, may hap the person see, Whom habit strange perswades it should be me. FINIS. TRVTHS COMPLAINT ouer England. My mournfull Muse Melpomine drawe neere, Thou saddest Ladie of the sisters three, And let her plaints in paper now appeere: Whose teares lyke Occean billowes seeme to bee: And should I note the plaintiffes name to thee? Men call her Truth, once had in great request, But banisht now of late for crafts behest. Amidst the rest that set their pen to booke, She pickt me out to tell this wofull tale, A simple Poet, on whose workes to looke, The finest heads would thinke it verie stale: Yet though vnworthie, to my friends auaile I take the toile, and praie my Muses aide: To blazon out the tale of Truth dismaide. Such time as Phœbus from the couloured skie, Did headlong driue his horses t'ord the West, To suffer horned Luna for to prie, Amidst the duskie darke, new raisde from rest, As I in fragrant fields with woes opprest: Gan walke to driue out melancholy griefe, Which in my heart at that time had the cheefe. It was my hap fast by a riuers side, To heare a rufull voice lamenting thus, You falling streames, euen as your waues diuide: So breakes my heart with passions perillous, Which faine I would vnto the world discusse, Were anie heere for to recount my moane, Whose wofull heart for inward griefe doth grone. Which sayd, she cast her dewed eyes askance, And spying me, gan rowse her heauie head, And praide me pen her sad and heauie chance, And she recounted it that present sted, I did agree, and graunting Truth me fed: With these reportes which I set downe in vearse, Which greeues my Muse for sorowes to rehearse. Whilome (deere friend) it was my chaunce to dwell, Within an Iland compast with the waue, A safe defence a forren foe to quell. Once Albion cald, next Britaine Brutus gaue, Now England hight, a plot of beautie braue, Which onely soyle, should seeme the seate bee, Of Paradise, if it from sinne were free. Within this place, within this sacred plot, I first did frame, my first contented bower, There found I peace and plentie for to float, There iustice rulde, and shinde in euerie stowre, There was I loude and sought too euerie howre, Their Prince content with plainnesse loued Truth, And pride by abstinence was kept from youth. Then flew not fashions euerie daie from Fraunce, Then sought not Nobles nouells from a farre, Then land was kept, not hazarded by chaunce, Then quiet minde preserud the soile from iarre, Cloth kept out colde, the poore releeued werre. This was the state, this was the luckie stowre, While Truth in England kept her stately bowre. Iustice did neuer looke with partiall eyes, Demosthenes was neuer dum for golde, The Princes eares were ope to pesants cries, And false suspect was charely kept in holde, Religion flourisht, liuings were not solde For lucre then, but giuen by desart, And each receiud, &amp; preacht with zealous hart. Then learning was the Loadstone of the land, Then husbandman was free from shiftes of lawe, Then faithfull promise stoode in steed of band, The Drones from busie Bee no Mel could drawe, Then loue, not feare, did keepe the state in awe: Then, then, did flourish that renowmed time, When earth and ashes thrusted not to clime. For as the horse well mand abides the bit, And learnes his stop by raine in riders hand, Where mountain colt that was not sadled yet, Runnes headlong on amidst the fallowed land, Whose fierce resist scarce bends with anie band: So men reclaimde by vertue, tread aright, Where led by follies mischiefes on them light. Use masters all, vse nurtereth mortall wayes, Use, vse of good, continues happie state, Use, vse of mee, made England then haue praise, But since abuse hath banisht me of late. Alasse the while, there runnes another rate, Which while by sad insight I looke into, I see the want of those that haue to doe. And yet I see not Sodome: some are good, Whose inward bowels dayly melt in mone, To see how Britane now is raging wood, Hard hearted, flintie minded, all in one, Bent to abuse, and leauing me alone. Alonely lead with carelesse shew of peace, Whereas secure regard doth sinne increase. Some, some there be whom zeale hath swallowed vp, First, blessed Prince, of whom I finde releefe, Some noble peeres that tast errors cup, Some godly Prelates in the Church are cheefe, Some Lawiers lead by zeale, lament my greefe. Some Merchants follow God, not swallow golde, Some countrie Swains loue truth you may be bolde. Yet as great store of Darnell marres the seed, Which else would spring within a fertile field: And as the fruitfull bud is choakt by weede: Which otherwise a gladsome grape would yeeld, So sometimes wicked men doe ouerweeld, And keepe in couert those who would direct, The common state, which error doth infect. Yet Truth must neuer alter from his name, Good Prince sayd I, ye good: what of her selfe? And that is good, for Princes that doe frame. Themselues to priuate good, doo subiects good, Yet that's not that same goodnesse I would name: Good Prince, good people, that's the good I craue, Of Princes goods, that goodnesse would I haue. For as the great commaunder of the tides, God Neptune can allay the swelling seas, And make the billowes mount on either sides: When wandering keeles his cholar would displease: So Princes may stirre vp and some appease, The commons heart to doe: and to destroy That which is good, or this, which threates anoy: For common state can neuer sway amisse When Princes liues doo leuell all a right, Be it for Prince that England happie is, Yet haplesse England if the fortune light: That with the Prince, the subiects seeke not right, Unhappie state, vnluckie times they bee, When Princes liues and subiects disagree. I know not I whence come these wayward woes, Whose sodaine showes portend this sodain change, Yet dooth mis doubt such sodaine feares disclose, As Truth this present doubts the sequell strange: When stable head, lets stailesse members range, I feare me: as the buildings trust to sand, So euery blast will stroy with turne of hand, When as in Court by proud contempt I see, A fashion feedes the fancies now a dayes, When as in Court promotions passed be By selfe opinion: oft the wise man sayes, The turnes are strange, and fauour soone decayes: And those whom fortune windeth now a floate, By change of fauour, soone may change their coate. When as election dooth but passe by sence, Then must I deeme the world is fed by showes: When garish beautie causeth vaine expence, It seemes the man should see, but little knowes, Repentaunce is the fruite by louing growes: So when in Court nought but such pleasures be, Repentaunce must ensue we well may see. But leauing Court, where though the bramble groes, Yet zealous care there sets her selfe I see, I doo in Court but now complaine of those, Who practise that that sits not their degree: Whose vaines by powre full oft corrected be: But now such colours cloake each bad pretence, That showes doo hold the wise in some suspence. But I poore I though greeud at courtlike scapes, Lamenting there the lauish vaine expence, Haue farther cause abroad to note escapes, Where craft dooth keepe true meaning in suspence: And wily worldlings couer their pretence: With holy shapes, and in a holy coate, Dooth flattry praise those men that swim a floate: In Nobles traines, who sees not strange mis deemes, Where each dooth gape and catch at priuate gaine, And fleece the Lord, who though he blindfold seemes, By oft attempts dooth barre them of their vaines, The painfull wretch who toiles with often paines, He hath faire words, when flattrie sucks the sweete. Thus showes take place, and Troth's trod vnder feete. In England gistes can compasse each reproofe, The bad for gold may soone be counted good, The wicked gainer for the states behoofe, The blindest buzzard to giue heauenly food, The faintest heart in warlikst place hath stood: And who giues most, hath now most store of farmes, Rackt rents, the Lord with golden fuell warmes. And Iustice so I feare by power is led, The poore may crie, and gladly creepe to crosse, The rich with wealth, the wealthie now are fed, The simple man now onely beares the losse, The Lawier he the golden crownes doth tosse, And now hath fees at will with cap and knee, And each man cries, good sir come plead for me. O sweete the time, when neither folly might Mislead your hopes, nor alter olde decrees. O happie Truth when as with sweete delight, She laboured still for conscience not for fees. O blessed time, when zeale with bended knees, Gan blesse the heauens, that bent their powres diuine, The English hearts to wisedome to encline. But now refusd, disdaind, and set at naught, Inforst to seeke for rest in place vnknowne, I wayle poore wretch, that no redresse is sought: But well I wot, my greefes are not mine owne, Some beare a part and helpe to waite my mone, But all in vaine: such colours now are made, That those would mend the misse, doo daunce in shade. This said, be wetting all the place with teares, And from her eyes expelling flouds of mone, Her louely lockes bespred about her eares, She waude her wings as willing to be gone: And after pause, she soard away anone, And thus she said: You Ilanders adieu, You banisht me, before I fled from you. Lenuoy. Beleeue me, Countrimen this thing is true. FINIS.</field>
