      <field name="fulltext">LYRICAL POEMS TO MY WIFE BOOK I (1887–1897) IN CARISSIMAM MEMORIAM A.S.P. To whom but thee, my youth to dedicate, My youth, which these few leaves have sought to save, Should I now come, although I come too late, Alas! and can but lay them on thy grave? To whom but thee? From thee, I know, they stole Their happier music, all their finer part: O could they breathe but something of thy soul, Something of thine incomparable heart! What was there lovely, that thou didst not love? What troubled spirit could ever grasp thy hand, Nor know what answering springs within thee strove To soothe his wound; to feel, to understand? Too much hadst thou of pain, and fret, and care; Yet surely thou wast meant for joy: to whom Life, that had given thee days so hard to bear, Could still yield moments of so rare a bloom. That longing in me, which can never sleep, To live my own life, to be bravely free, What is that longing, but the passion deep, The sweet endeavour, to be true to thee? Still in my mind the solemn morning shines; Still with me, all too clearly pictured, dwell The day, the hour, with all their mournful signs, When we bade thee, O friend of friends, farewell. Austerely fair, the vast cathedral, filled With February sunshine, marbles old, Pillar on pillar, arch on arch revealed: The light, the stillness, on my grief took hold; Hushed within those gray walls, that could not change, Where kneeling sorrow heavenly comfort hears; Appeased by their eternal strength, that, strange Itself to pain, permitted human tears. There that worn heart, those arms in longing strained Beyond, beyond, toward the unknown shore, Entered repose, their long-loved peace attained. Sweetly she sleeps. O shall we wish her more? I climbed the high tower, up steep stairs of stone. Under the clear sun plains without a wave, Various and busy, in the morning shone: The world about me, but below, thy grave. White flowers marked it. Now, my flowers' poor grace I bring, to bloom or fade; I little care, Ah, let them fade, and die in that dear place! It is enough, if they have faded there. AN APRIL DAY Breezes strongly rushing, when the North-West stirs, Prophesying Summer to the shaken firs; Blowing brows of forest, where soft airs are free, Crowned with heavenly glimpses of the shining sea; Buds and breaking blossoms, that sunny April yields; Ferns and fairy grasses, the children of the fields; In the fragrant hedges' hollow brambled gloom Pure primroses paling into perfect bloom; Round the elms rough stature, climbing dark and high, Ivy-fringes trembling against a golden sky; Woods and windy ridges darkening in the glow; The rosy sunset bathing all the vale below; Violet banks forsaken in the fading light; Starry sadness filling the quiet eyes of night; Dew on all things drooping for the summer rains; Dewy daisies folding in the lonely lanes. TESTAMENTUM AMORIS I cannot raise my eyelids up from sleep, But I am visited with thoughts of you; Slumber has no refreshment half so deep As the sweet morn, that wakes my heart anew. I cannot put away life's trivial care, But you straightway steal on me with delight; My purest moments are your mirror fair; My deepest thought finds you the truth most bright. You are the lovely regent of my mind, The constant sky to my unresting sea; Yet, since 'tis you that rule me, I but find A finer freedom in such tyranny. Were the world's anxious kingdoms governed so, Lost were their wrongs, and vanished half their woe. PINE TREES Down through the heart of the dim woods The laden, jolting waggons come. Tall pines, chained together, They carry; stems straight and bare, Now no more in their own solitudes With proud heads to rock and hum; Now at the will of men to fare Away from their brethren, their forest friends In the still woods; through wild weather Alone to endure to the world's ends: Soon to feel the power of the North Careering over dark waves' foam; Soon to exchange the steady earth For heaving decks; the scents of their home, Honeyed wild-thyme, gorse and heather, For the sting of the spray, the bitter air. PRESENT AND FUTURE Look, as a mother bending o'er her boy, The sleeping boy that in her bosom lies, Gazes upon him in a trance of joy With earnest, infinitely tender eyes, Lost in her deep love, and aware of nought, Earth and the sunlight, men and trees and skies Quite faded out from her impassioned thought; Yet knows one day it will be otherwise, When, laid alone within the narrow tomb, Death leaves her none to love; but in youth's bloom, Or grown to manhood and to strength, her son Over the same earth that has closed on her Rejoicing wanders on, And strikes fresh tracks of thronged and fruitful life, Nor frets at the sweet need for change and strife, With eager mind and glowing heart astir In ardour ever to pursue Passions and actions, and adventures new: So is the Present Age, So strives she for that Age to come, her child. Which knows not yet the pain, the sacrifice, She for its sake endures; it knows not yet, But must one day, the battles it must wage. And she, if it within its sleep have smiled, Is happy in her woes: no vain regret Saps the sad strength with which she labours still For that imagined bliss she shall not see, So dear, so deeply hoped-for though it be. And ever with unconquerable will, Bearing her burden, toward one distant star She moves in her desire; and though with pain She labour, and the goal she dreams be far, Proud is she in her passionate soul to know That from her tears, her very sorrows grow The joy, the hope, the peace of future men. YOUTH When life begins anew, And Youth, from gathering flowers, From vague delights, rapt musings, twilight hours, Turns restless, seeking some great deed to do, To sum his fostered dreams; when that fresh birth Unveils the real, the thronged and spacious Earth, And he awakes to those more ample skies, By other aims and by new powers possessed: How deeply, then, his breast Is filled with pangs of longing! how his eyes Drink in the enchanted prospect! Fair it lies Before him, with its plains expanding vast, Peopled with visions, and enriched with dreams; Dim cities, ancient forests, winding streams, Places resounding in the famous past, A kingdom ready to his hand! How like a bride Life seems to stand In welcome, and with festal robes arrayed! He feels her loveliness pervade And pierce him with inexplicable sweetness; And, in her smiles delighting, and the fires Of his own pulses, passionate soul! Measure his strength by his desires, And the wide future by their fleetness, As his thought leaps to the long-distant goal. So eagerly across that unknown span Of years he gazes: what, to him, Are bounds and barriers, tales of Destiny, Death, and the fabled impotence of man? Already, in his marching dream, Men at his sun-like coming seem As with an inspiration stirred, and he To kindle with new thoughts degenerate nations, In sordid cares immersed so long; Thrilled with ethereal exultations And a victorious expectancy, Even such as swelled the breasts of Bacchus' throng, When that triumphal burst of joy was hurled Upon the wondering world; When from the storied, sacred East afar, Down Indian gorges clothed in green, With flower-reined tigers and with ivory car He came, the youthful god; Beautiful Bacchus, ivy-crowned, his hair Blown on the wind, and flushed limbs bare, And lips apart, and radiant eyes, And ears that caught the coming melodies, As wave on wave of revellers swept abroad; Wreathed with vine-leaves, shouting, trampling onwards, With tossed timbrel and gay tambourine. Alas! the disenchanting years have rolled On hearts and minds becoming cold: Mirth is gone from us; and the world is old. O bright new-comer, filled with thoughts of joy, Joy to be thine amid these pleasant plains, Know'st thou not, child, what surely coming pains Await thee, for that eager heart's annoy? Misunderstanding, disappointment, tears, Wronged love, spoiled hope, mistrust and ageing fears, Eternal longing for one perfect friend, And unavailing wishes without end? Thou proud and pure of spirit, how must thou bear To have thine infinite hates and loves confined, Schooled, and despised? How keep unquenched and free Mid others' commerce and economy Such ample visions, oft in alien air Tamed to the measure of the common kind? How hard for thee, swept on, for ever hurled From hour to hour, bewildered and forlorn, To move with clear eyes and with steps secure, To keep the light within, fitly to scorn These all too possible and easy goals, Trivial ambitions of soon-sated souls. And, patient in thy purpose, to endure The pity and the wisdom of the world. Vain, vain such warning to those happy ears! Disturb not their delight! By unkind powers Doomed to keep pace with the relentless Hours, He, too, ere long, shall feel Earth's glory change; Familiar names shall take an accent strange, A deeper meaning, a more human tone; No more passed by, unheeded or unknown, The things that then shall be beheld through tears. Yet, O just Nature, thou Who, if men's hearts be hard, art always mild; O fields and streams, and places undefiled, Let your sweet airs be ever on his brow, Remember still your child. Thou too, O human world, if old desires, If thoughts, not alien once, can move thee now, Teach him not yet that idly he aspires Where thou hast failed; not soon let it be plain, That all who seek in thee for nobler fires, For generous passion, spend their hopes in vain: Lest that insidious Fate, foe of mankind, Who ever waits upon our weakness, try With whispers his unnerved and faltering mind, Palsy his powers; for she has spells to dry, Like the March blast, his blood, turn flesh to stone, And, conjuring action with necessity, Freeze the quick will, and make him all her own. Come, then, as ever, like the Wind at morning! Joyous, O Youth, in the aged world renew Freshness to feel the eternities around it, Rain, stars, and clouds, light and the sacred dew. The strong sun shines above thee: That strength, that radiance bring! If Winter come to Winter, When shall men hope for Spring? THE EVENING TAKES ME FROM YOUR SIDE The evening takes me from your side; The darkness creeps into my breast. Swift clouds across the dim heavens glide, And fill me with their vague unrest. I wander sad, and know not why: The lighted streets perplex my brain. I wish for wings, that I might fly From sound and glare, to you again. TINTAGEL Low is laid Arthur's head, Unknown earth above him mounded; By him sleep his splendid knights, With whose names the world resounded. Ruined glories! flown delights, Sunk 'mid rumours of old wars! Where they revelled, deep they sleep By the wild Atlantic shores. On Tintagel's fortressed walls, Proudly built, the loud sea scorning, Pale the moving moonlight falls; Through their rents the wind goes mourning. See ye, Knights, your ancient home, Chafed and spoiled and fallen asunder? Hear ye now, as then of old, Waters rolled, and wrath of foam, Where the waves beneath your graves Snow themselves abroad in thunder? O SUMMER SUN! O summer sun, O moving trees! O cheerful human noise, O busy glittering street! What hour shall Fate in all the future find, Or what delights, ever to equal these: Only to taste the warmth, the light, the wind, Only to be alive, and feel that life is sweet? NAME, THAT MAKES MY HEART BEAT Name, that makes my heart beat, Heard by chance in the throng'd street, How delighted I turn to greet The vision adored, the vision rare, That surely should be where thou art spoken! Alas, alas! it is not there: Only hurrying faces stare, Hard faces, in cold surprise, Amazed at the joy that out of my eyes Shines expectant, and then dies Disappointed, the sweet spell broken! NIGHTFALL Sweet after labour, soft and whispering night Blows on dark fields and fragrant country here: Here there is sleep, to weary limbs delight; The world is far away, the stars are near. The world is far away: but there, I know, Night comes to few unanxious, happy eyes; And cities, with their restless streets aglow, Lamps upon lamps, outface the enkindled skies. London lies there; an endless fiery maze, Thronged with her millions, sleepless, vast, alone; The stars are pale above her, where her gaze Lights the wide heavens and makes the night her own. There the hot wind blows over no dark fields: Brief, hard-won rest despotic labours give: Sleep, to how many spent-out spirits, yields Life's only sweetness, to forget they live! O WORLD, BE NOBLER O World, be nobler, for her sake! If she but knew thee, what thou art, What wrongs are borne, what deeds are done In thee, beneath thy daily sun, Know'st thou not that her tender heart, For pain and very shame, would break? O World, be nobler, for her sake! KENNACK SANDS On Kennack Sands the sun Shines, and the fresh wind blows, Moulding pale banks anew, Where the sea-holly grows. Waters softly blue And exquisitely clear Meet the o'er-arching sky; O'er them the breezes run. There may'st thou idly lie, And still find new delights, Watching the gulls' white flights Above that lonely place; Listen, nor ever hear A single human sound To spoil the free, profound, Aerial quietness. But when thou'rt gone, the night On Kennack comes; and soon, Lovely beyond dreams, Arises the round moon; In whose trembling light The rough splendour gleams Of the crested sea. Ah, could'st thou there then be! But mortal ears can hear not What those pale sands hear then; Sounds not of mortal birth, Laughter, and dance, and mirth, Of the golden-haired sea-fairies, Mermaidens and mermen. AN OLD ANSWER Ask me not, Dear, what thing it is That makes me love you so; What graces, what sweet qualities, That from your spirit flow: For I have but this old reply, That you are you, that I am I. My heart leaps when you look on me, And thrills to hear your voice. Lies, then, in these the mystery That makes my soul rejoice? I only know, I love you true; Since I am I, and you are you. THE AUTUMN CROCUS In the high woods that crest our hills, Upon a steep, rough slope of forest ground, Where few flowers grow, sweet blooms to-day I found Of the Autumn Crocus, blowing pale and fair. Dim falls the sunlight there; And a mild fragrance the lone thicket fills. Languidly curved, the long white stems Their purple flowers' gold treasure scarce display: Lost were their leaves since in the distant spring, Their February sisters showed so gay. Roses of June, ye too have followed fleet! Forsaken now, and shaded as by thought, As by the human shade of thought and dreams, They bloom 'mid the dark wood, whose air has wrought With what soft nights and mornings of still dew! Into their slender petals that clear hue, Like paleness in fresh cheeks; a thing On earth, I vowed, ne'er grew More delicately pure, more shyly sweet. Child of the pensive autumn woods! So lovely, though thou dwell obscure and lone, And though thy flush and gaiety be gone; Say, among flowers of the sad, human mind, Where shall I ever find So rare a grace? in what shy solitudes? THE WOUND I have too happy been. Some sad Fate envies me. An arrow she, unseen, Has fitted to her bow, And smiling grim, I know, Let the drawn shaft leap free. Deep in my side it pierced: With sudden pain I shook, And gazed around, the accurst Perfidious foe to espy. Lo, only thou art nigh, With sweet and troubled look! O CRUDELIS AMOR! It was Spring, the sweet Spring, when first I met with Love. Suddenly I raised my eyes; and he stood there. He was so beautiful, I could not look elsewhere. For joy I could not speak; I gazed but could not move; But all my body trembled, as he spoke and stole, With his voice's wonder, my surrendered soul. Ah, why was there none nigh, to whisper me, Beware? GO NOW, LOVE Go now, Love, Since staying's joy no longer! Leave me to prove If Time can make me stronger! Nay, look not over thy shoulder so, Pleading so sweetly to remain, Where thou workest so much pain: Look not behind thee, haste and go! Ah, how should I Deal to thee such hard measure, As force thee fly, Who broughtest heavenly pleasure? Take pity, Love, and be kind To him that could not refuse thee! Is it not grief enough to lose thee? Haste, O haste, nor look behind! THE LAST EVENING Over sea the sun in a mystery of light Burns across the waters, on the blown spray glancing: Luminously crested, wave behind wave advancing Pours its rushing foam with low continual roar. The wide sands around us, flashing wet and bright, Mirror cliffs suffused with clearest warmth serene, Rosy earth, gray rocks, and grass of greenest green; We two pace together the solitary shore. A sadness and a joy are mingled in the air; From the dying day a voice, I go and come back never, From the waves an answering shout, We rush, we break for ever, Wake in my heart echoes that conflicting swell. Now on the last evening, now we are aware Of something in our souls that will not say, 'Tis ended. In our parting looks are thoughts eternal blended: See, our hands are joined; we cannot say farewell! AS I WALKED THROUGH LONDON As I walked through London, The fresh wound burning in my breast, As I walked through London, Longing to have forgotten, to harden my heart, and to rest, A sudden consolation, a softening light Touched me: the streets alive and bright, With hundreds each way thronging, on their tide Received me, a drop in the stream, unmarked, unknown. And to my heart I cried: Here can thy trouble find shelter, thy wound be eased! For see, not thou alone, But thousands, each with his smart, Deep-hidden, perchance, but felt in the core of the heart! And as to a sick man's feverish veins The full sponge warmly pressed, Relieves with its burning the burning of forehead and hands, So, I, to my aching breast, Gathered the griefs of those thousands, and made them my own; My bitterest pains Merged in a tenderer sorrow, assuaged and appeased. NOT EVEN LOVE Dear child, thou know'st, I blame not thee; Thou too, I know, hast shared the smart. Neither did wrong; 'twas only she, Nature, that moulded us apart. But not to have sinned, in Nature's eyes I find a brittle plea to trust: She punishes the just unwise More hardly than the wise unjust. She placed our souls, like Heaven's lone spheres, In separate paths, no power can move: O truth too heart-breaking for tears! Not even Love, not even Love! THE DISOBEDIENT HEART Stern Power, whose heavy hand I feel, Whose infinite, world-urging force, Nor silent pain nor strong appeal Persuades from its imperious course, Idly I strive with thee; 'tis thou Rul'st in this world of thwarted will! To thine omnipotence I bow; And dare to disobey thee still. FIRST DAY OF WINTER Like the bloom on a grape is the evening air And a first faint frost the wind has bound. Yet the fear of his breath avails to scare The withered leaves on the cold ground. For they huddle and whisper in phantom throngs, I hear them beneath the branches bare: We danced with the Wind, we sang his songs; Now he pursues us, we know not where. THE CONVALESCENT O strange, O sweetly warm Falls the sunshine on my cheek. I taste the cordial North; In the pines I hear him speak. A new, a tender charm Is in my life begun, To joy that opens forth As the sunflower to the sun. Winds that with moving light Wash heaven, and drive the showers! Ferns uncurling free, Wet heads of nodding flowers! O clouds, loftily bright, That build your domes in the blue, Is the world new-made for me? Is it I that am born anew? My weak steps prove in thee, Earth, a strength more stable. Limbs, that fever shook, Thy wholesome airs enable. Life by both hands raises me To stand firm on my feet: Into her eyes I look And find, to trust her, sweet. THE CHESTNUT Who enters here, beneath this guardian shade, Feels over him a tender sky of leaves Dearer than heaven: at once his eye receives Strange quiet: fathomless as water swayed Above far-sunken ships, this luminous height Of dimness interposed Against the hot sun-beams Opens, a world uncertain of cool dreams And blurs of shadow and spots of sleepy light With ever greener quiet charmed and closed. Yet in the soft-hung leaves a splendour lies, As though not from the far-off noon it came But in themselves a green indwelling flame Were prisoned. Here unanswered mysteries Content me, and of peace I want not more, But feed on thoughts that end In a sweet pause of mind, As if from my own being back resigned To the universal essence of Earth's core, Where over me the saps of life ascend. WHEN OLD WOUNDS BLEED AGAIN When old wounds bleed again In the silence of the night, And mixt with sweet delight Wells up the stream of pain, Is it less hard to endure That when the sword struck first So keen, with edge so sure? Was that wild hour the worst? O then a too strong smart O'erwhelmed the senses' power. Now in some tranquil hour When, fortified, the heart Is capable at ease Of sorrow, now returns By exquisite degrees Pain, and in silence burns. Is this still woe forlorn Less than that fierce despair? Perhaps 'tis worse to bear Because 'tis easier borne. MONTENEGRO Coiled in shadow, the serpent seas Engirdle perilous hills sublime: By tortuous, steep degrees Toward the morn I climb. Before me the mountain soaring vast Secludes the bright east; cold the air Descends from ridges, massed In peaks, snowily fair. But pale in the northern distance blushes On sparkling ranges a light austere; Tingeing the shade, it flushes Edge and barrier sheer. Cattaro roofs and Cattaro quay Grow faint and delicate; ships that ride On the dense blue slumbering sea Dwindle; on either side From mirroring gulfs the mountains bare Are mapped to the heaven, strange as a dream; The Adriatic afar Trembles, a molten gleam: Till the sun salutes me, met with him On the naked summit; closed behind, That vision of countries dim Pales and fades from the mind. Now drinking the eager lofty air, The spirit leaps, as the eyes behold Valleys severely fair, Freedom's fortress of old. Young, stern soldiers in rich attire, Haughtily moving with silent pace And eyes of a tranquil fire; Sons of a tameless race; Aged mothers, bowed with toil, Old men, bearded and gray, are here. Plants of a stubborn soil That knows not the seed of fear. O Mountain, mother of men, that bearest Heroes; foster-mother of fame! I hail thee; well thou wearest Thy dark, invincible name. Thou plantest the footstep firm, and the heart In the breast strengthenest, hardy to try Peril, and play its part With full, unwavering eye. At mighty breasts of the ancient hills Nourished, thy sons in their veins yet keep The force that feeds and fills Torrents, to dance and leap. Trees that with clenchéd root possess Their rocky beds, oak and pine, Alone thou endurest; nor less Permittest in children of thine. DOWN IN A SHADED GARDEN Down in a shaded garden I laid upon earth my head: The deep trees murmured, darkly fresh, Over my bed; I looked through living leaves to the sky, Odours and songs were quivering nigh; The warm grass touched my cheek as I lay And care from me was far away. As a child to its mother, to Earth I drew; I felt her true. Of Life, sweet Life, enamoured, I closed my eyes, to feel The sweetness pierce to the inmost veins And the whole heart steal; Sacred Life, more sweet and fair Than all her children of earth and air, Fountain dearer than joy in the breast, In the blue I adored, in the grass I caressed: Then Earth, my mother, leaned to my ear, And spoke me clear. To thee the rose her odour, Her glory dedicates; And thee the pink's sweet-budded fringe Of snow awaits. For thee is the sprinkled fire of the broom, For thee the azalea burns her bloom; O child, does thy heart not tell thee how Thy joy is answered from every bough? In the throat of the bird, in the sap of the tree, 'Tis all for thee! Stricken with joy and wonder I raised my eyes around, And saw what mystery flowered for me In that enchanted ground! The roses, the roses, rich-entwined, Heavy with love to me inclined; Yearning up from the dusk of death They trembled toward me with living breath. O none that loved me is dead, I knew, And each is true. ILLUMINATION Is it joy, or is it peace, Senses' magical release, That triumphant swells my heart Where I walk the fields apart? Miracle of morning new! Meadows dabbled fresh in dew; Straight-stemmed woods that darkly still Stand upon the rounded hill, Where the silver saplings gleam On the edges of a dream; Mists that in faint fleeces blur All the frayed plumes of the fir, And that whiten the fresh green Of the bosomed field between, Melted ever more and more By the level beams that pour Sparkling through the sleepy, rare, Delicately coloured air; Flowers that wake from peace to peace; Subtle-scented loneliness; World that drenches through and through A stillness exquisite as dew; Ploughman ploughing nigh at hand Along the open hazy land, Calm as though a part of those Brown furrows over which he goes:— O what fount is it in me All this solitude sets free? Far from miseries, that dart Pangs of pity at the heart, Far from prisoning tasks that hide The vision true of freedom wide, Through a melting curtain clear The stir of spring I see and hear: Softly the young beams surprise My own spirit's mysteries, And my still thought, scarce aware, Mingles into radiant air. Now my eyes I cast around On an unsubstantial ground: As I gaze, I seem to grow Into Earth, her longing know, Feel the swelling of the bud Quicken warm within my blood; And the grasses shooting higher Are a wave of my desire. Deep and deeper sinks my mind To a charm intense resigned, Deep into the grain of things Dissolved with its imaginings. Now the ploughman ploughs, as he Furrowed lines of destiny: Now the oak his shadow due Claims as if from earth it grew, Not by casual beams of day Given, and then stolen away. I too from Time's ample womb Summon my appointed doom, And conjure the hours to bring Each its rapture, each its sting. In a vista long appears The close-peopled street of years. There the hands that I shall clasp Are stretched out, my own to grasp. Ready in my heart the throe Burns for each awaiting woe. Sorrow with her silent spade Graves for unborn hopes hath made. Joy about me glides her arm Ignorant of grief and harm, Like a child that only knows Where 'tis loved and thither goes. Onward on the path begun I perceive my footsteps run, Yet backward stretching all I find In the mirror of my mind; In a hundred sleeps behold My own face becoming old; And inaudibly drawn near Death has whispered in my ear. FIRST DAY OF SUMMER Sweetest of all delights are the vainest, merest; Hours when breath is joy, for the breathing's sake. Summer awoke this morning, and early awake I rose refreshed, and gladly my eyes saluted The entering beam of the sun that laughed his clearest. I too laughed for pleasure, and vowed straightway To stream and sun the flower of an idle day, With summer sweetly enjoyed and friends well suited. Merry were we, as stepping aboard we laid The shaven oars in order; merry the leap Of the oar, that grasped the water and stirred from sleep A wave, to tremble past us in foamy rings. With rhyming fall, and with bright returning blade Impetuous music urges the rippling keel; Softly our necks the flow of the breezes feel; And blue, and thronged with birds, the morning sings. And lo, the elms, in a day reclothed and gleaming In delicate youth, above us stir their leaves. The eye, to naked winter used, receives A magic pleasure: and still the shore we follow Winding in flowery meadows; freshly streaming The river meets us ever from fields unknown: As light we travel his curving mirror lone, No longer I envy you, O frolic swallow. Till moored at noon by shadowy turf, and ended Awhile that pleasant toil, what relish keen At ease to lie amid flowers, with rustling green O'ershaded; there, reclined by a bubbling pool, The rushing weir in murmur and foam blended, Entrancing ear and eye, caresses the brain With smooth perpetual sound, the lulling strain Of water weariless poured and glittering cool. O then, refreshed, in the level light serene Our boat re-entering, her prow homeward turned, How soft we glided; soft, as evening burned Through drooping leaves, our liquid furrow stirred The dim green heights of the elm, reflected green In shadowy water; at last the dreaming shore From its own enchanted mirror we know no more: Softly we glided downward, and spoke no word. Nor took we land, till the West in a blush was dying, And over the twilit meadow we loitered home. Even now in my ear is rushing the constant foam, And the dappled stream is alight with the wind's laughter, As I taste, in the cool of the darkness dreamily lying, The sun yet warm upon limbs that sweetly ache; Drowsed deliciously, still I linger awake, Only to keep my delight, and to look not after. THE OAK Splendours of sunset burned upon the ground, As from the lane's deep shade Emerging, a warm grassy plat we found Skirting the forest glade, And in the midst a solitary oak. No sound the bright and haunting stillness broke As we beheld the wonder of this tree, His shadowy core invaded thick by rays That kindled the rough trunk, and ardently Made burn the massy branches, thrusting higher And wider their strong foliage, knotted sprays Of tawny and bronze leaves defined in fire. Silence possessed us pausing, and our eyes Stayed wondering to behold In that illumined solitude arise Those fiery branches old. It seemed a mighty apparition brought From far to trouble us; planted beyond thought And budding calm into a time not ours. Then, then smote full upon our inmost heart Its mortal weakness: without bound and vast Our longing, but our scope brief as the flowers, That in a season perish and are past. THE ENEMY Would'st thou this monster, that we name the world, Who round the envied tree of blissful fruit Lies like a dragon curled In jealous watch, our venture to dispute; Would'st thou that she were smoothly negligent, By any pleader bent, A tender judge, to tears and pity prone, She that on love defeated builds her throne, The spoiler strong, sanguine with our despairs, She that the traitor in us holds in fee, Rich with our woes, with our fears cruel, she Whose easy wisdom the sad heart ensnares? Rather rejoice that this immortal foe To truceless war our ardour challenges. She hath her task to do, Her maw to fill, her rages to appease; Nor less because the noble rebel claims Exemption from her shames, Is of her native harshness justified. Sharp be our swords, trebly our armour tried, Our hearts enduring and relentless be To look her 'twixt the eyes as conquering men And take her worst of wounds. For then, O then, If we can bear our freedom, we are free. PRICKING THORNS My spirit to-day that sprang To meet the laughing morn Is clouded and forlorn And chafes with hidden pang. For teasing care and fret Stifle her sweet desire And with small dust beset Her eager fire. Not so my darkened breast Deep in its depth was stirred When Sorrow, the dusky bird, With me prepared her nest. I on her wing would rise And over city and sea Voyage with gazing eyes Mournful, yet free. Then from these pricking thorns I pluck an omen bright! Since most their trivial spite The soul indignant scorns, With joy vast as despair Alone she mates, I know; And, born to an ample air, Claims a great foe. THE DRIFTWOOD GATHERERS Along the deep shelve of the abandoned shore Bowed, with slow pace and careful eyes that keep The track they travel, move an aged pair. The full voice of the Atlantic holds the air In turbulent uproar: The sad South over desolation blows, The clouds in wild race never sleep. But they the shaken snows Of trampling breakers heed not, nor the hiss Of quarrelling foam-curves hurried up the strand, To fade upon the darkened, glistening sand: Skirting that fretful line, they from amid The matted shells and seaweed heedfully Glean their poor treasure hid, The scattered driftwood, fragments bleached and dry. Implacable ocean, in whose ear Even at this instant, cries come uselessly From mouths that the salt wave and gripping fear Together choke, far in the lonely storm, Where mighty ships, conquered and battling, drown; He to this powerless pair their simple store Permits, refraining: fearing not his frown They his expended rages hold in fee; And them his violent armies wound no more Than the pale poppy on the neglected shore. But now as evening closes, they begin Their homeward path, bordered with heath and pine, And see afar their cottage roof and wall White under red leaves of the October vine; Till glad and tired they win The door, and let their cherished burden fall, Then on the swept stones make their happy fire. Soon a flame leaps, and in the wavering gloom The dim wall smiles, and every nook of home Invites them warm in welcoming attire. The ripe gourd basks his jovial yellow girth; Rosily burnished gleam the onion strings Above; the pottage simmers in low mirth, And in an earthen brazier chestnuts crack, But each is busy now, that nothing lack. And she in snatches sings Old songs, and he with chiding feigned the while Chides her, and meets her answer with a smile. At last, when all is done to their desire, They sup: the low lamp kindles their old cheeks And features moulded in the cast of Earth, Their infinite companion: she but speaks Simply to them, in few words; death and birth, Winter and summer, rain and frost and sun; Nor they a care beyond the task invent. Enough, if day provide their need; day done, They by each other's side sleep, well content. THE VOICES OF OCEAN All the night the voices of ocean around my sleep Their murmuring undulation sleepless kept. Rocked in a dream I slept, Till drawn from trances deep At the invocation of morning calling strong, I felt through sanguine eyelids light suffuse My brain, and woke to a wonder of glad hues, And over the trembling choir of birds that throng Among the tamarisk and the glittering dews I heard, O sea, thy song. A charm has lured my feet, and I to the beach come down, The bright abandoned beach, the curving strand, And stripping upon the sand I meet the salt spray o'er my body blown, Embracing swift the jubilant waves that send Their triumphing surges shouting to the shores around, Until in a rushing splendour senses drowned The solid earth forgetting, haste to spend Their ever-fresh delight in the glory of swift sound And the thunder without end. But now from the wave withdrawn in indolent ease Again desire upsprings to know thy heart. I pace by the foam apart Or linger in shadow shy, removed from any breeze. Come, thou hast more to tell, thou hast not done, I will be patient, all day lying in wait to hear Upon the warm rock ledges hearkening near, Of all thy thousand tones to lose not one, While the shattered surf blows o'er me, leaping clear To the seaward-journeying sun. Radiant, hurrying delight of crests that dance and advance, Careless, arrogant legions, tossing their milky manes; How the wet light leaps and rains From shivered plumes that melt in a lightning glance And splendour of airy tresses backward blown! What shouts of exultation, laughter sweet, Wail of vanishing hosts and sighs of defeat, Irresistible menace and anguished moan; A thousand voices mingle in triumph and retreat: But tell me, O sea, thine own! Surely to happy mirth thou wooest my desire; Willing is my heart with thy young waves to roam, Lightly tripping foam, Ever laughing nearer, ever dancing higher. Sweeter than all glory, where the spirit wills With heart outpoured in song triumphant as the tide, With eager, open heart, ever to ride and ride! Yet now at height of joy what tumult fills Thy rushing strength? A sudden gloom invades thy pride Resisted, an anger thrills. Mutinous indignation that heavy Fate defies, The ignorant rocks that set their sullen jaws, In thy white flames that never pause Rebelliously upleaping, my own heart I recognise. I see the world's embattled towers uplift their height, The wise, distrusting faces of them that trample truth; I see the bodies slain of hopeless hoping youth; And dark my heart upswells to the vainly echoing fight, Cries of the helpless, tears of idle ruth, And the wrong I cannot right. Melancholy, to thee must I my vows resign? The bitterness of my spirit give away To the bitter broken spray? O down-drawn sighing streams, with you repine? Cover me, heavy waters, that I may hide my face In darkness, nor behold the ruined flowers I sowed Desolately forsaken that so sweetly glowed. Defeated too am I, and languish in my place, And still as glory fades, I bear a heavier load, And the desert spreads apace. Figures of sorrow now in my remembrance stand, I see the face of her that her children ask for bread— She turns away her head: The face of him that all day toils on a stony land; Women that ere the morning to their woe awake; And him that sightless hears the murmur gaily streams, Knocking weary the pavement that opens not for him. O loud bewailing waves, you tremble as you break, And you lift your dirges wild as you vanish into dream For these and for my sake. But hark! what voice emerges from the lamenting choir? Surely Love is speaking! My heart trembles to hear. Now no more I fear, I cast my grief behind, I have but one desire; To give my soul entire, nor to count any cost, To pour my heart in passionate unreason sweet, To follow and to follow with ever faithful feet The steps adored of Love, whatever peril crossed, With bliss or woe extreme my longing to complete, In love divinely lost. Sea, was this thy errand? Ah, but hush; Again the wild lament, again the strife! And now in mirth of life Thy gleeful waters all overriding rush. O have I heard at last? For now thy voices call Mingled and sounding clear in a mighty voice as one. In my heart they mingle that rejecteth none; Sorrow that no longer shall my head appal, Love, my sweetest joy; pain that I fear to shun; I need, I need them all. THE RENEWAL No more of sorrow, the world's old distress, Nor war of thronging spirits numberless, Immortal ardours in brief days confined, No more the languid fever of mankind To-day I sing: 'tis no melodious pain Cries in me: a full note, a rapturous strain My voice adventures. Tremblest thou, my heart, Because so eagerly the bliss would start Up from thy fountains? O be near to me, Thou that upliftest, thou that sett'st me free! Out of the dim vault and the dying hues Of Autumn, that for every wanderer strews On silent paths the perishing pale leaves, Fallen, like thoughts the heart no more believes, From blackened branches to the frozen ground: Out of the multitudinous dim sound Of millions, to each other all unknown, Warring together on the alien stone Of streets unnumbered; where with drooping head Prisoners pass, by unseen tyrants led And with inaudible manacles oppressed, Where he who listens cannot ever rest For hearing in his heart the cry of men, His brothers, from their lamentable den; Out of all these I come to this sweet waste Of woods and waters, and the odour taste Of pines in sunshine hearkening to the roar Of ocean on his solitary shore; Lone beaches, where the yellow poppy blows Unplucked, and where the wind for ever flows Over the heathy desert; where the sea Sparkles afar into infinity; And the cleared spirit, tasting all things clean, Rejoices, as if grief had never been; Where thou, to whom the birds and the waves sing, By some enchantment hast restored the Spring. As when a dear hand touches on the hair And thrills away the heaviness of care, Till the world changes and through a window bright The upleaping spirit gazes in delight, Over my brain I feel a calming hand; I look upon sweet earth and understand: I hear the loud wind laughing through the trees; The nimble air my limbs encourages, And I upraise my songs afresh begun, A palinode to the triumphant sun. But thou, from whom into my soul to-day Enters a quivering glory, ray on ray, O by thine eyes a sister of the Spring, Striking a core of sweetness in each thing Thou look'st on, till it blossoms! By thy voice, Soul of all souls created to rejoice! Thou that with native overbrimming sense Takest the light of Beauty's effluence, As from the morning, in May's festal prime, The young green leaves of the swift-budded lime; That drawest all glad things, they know not why, By some dear magnet of felicity; And mournful spirits from their yoke of pain Enchantest, till they lift their necks again, And looking in thy bright and gentle eyes To thee devote their dearest enterprise; Thou whose brave heart could its own pain consume And turn to deeper tenderness; in whom Looks, thoughts, and motions, speech and mien persuade, Immortal Joy hath his own mansion made: How shall my too full heart, my stammering tongue, Render thee half the song which thou hast sung Into my being, by no web of words Hindered, and fluid as the note of birds? Or tell what magic of sweet air is shed On me, so radiantly comforted? I need each beam of the young sun; I need Each draught of the pure wind, whereon to feed My joy; each sparkle of the dew that shines Under your branches, dark, sun-drunken pines, All voices, motions of the unwearied sea; But most, O tender spirit, I need thee. For thou to this dumb beauty art the tone It fain would render; all that is thine own Of wayward and most human and most sweet Mingling, until the music be complete: Thine accents, O adorable and dear, Command me to rejoice and have no fear; Out of remembrance wash the soil of pain And medicine me to my own self again. Muse of my quickened verse, I am as he Who, striving in the vast up-swollen sea, Lifted a moment on a wave, descries Unrolling suddenly the boundless skies. Now is mere breathing joy; and all that strife Confused and darkling, that we miscall life, Is as a cloak, cast off in the warm spring. Thus to possess the sunlight, is a thing Worth more than our ambitions; more than ease Wrung from the despot labour, the stale lees Of youthful bliss: more than the plotting mind Can ever compass, or the heart can find In wisest books or multitude of friends. For this it is that brings us to the lap Of bounteous Earth, and fills us with her sap And early laughter; melts the petty ends Of daily striving into boundless air, Revealing to the soul what it can dare: Frees and enriches thousandfold; and steeps This trembling self in universal deeps; Lends it the patience of the eternal hills To bear, no more in solitude, its ills, And with all fervours of the world inspires Its re-awakened and divine desires. This is it that can find the deepest root In us, and urge unto the fairest fruit, Persuading the shut soul, that hid in night, To crowd its blissful leaves into the light, And shed, upon the lost, immortal seeds: Kindles into a forge of fiery deeds The smouldering heart, and closes the long wound Of gentle spirits by rough time untuned; And, O more precious even yet than this, Empowers our weakness to support in bliss The immensity of love, to love in vain Yet still to hunger for that priceless pain; To love without a bound, to set no end To our long love, never aside to bend In loving, but pour forth in living streams Our hearts, as the full morn his quenchless beams. He that this light hath tasted, asks no more Dim questions answerless, that have so sore Perplexed our thinking: in his bosom flow Springs of all knowledge he hath need to know. Nor vaunts he the secure philosophy Self-throned, that would so easily untie The knot of this hard world: and judging straight Pronounce its essence and declare its fate. How should the universal heart be known To him that can so hardly read his own? For where is he that can the inmost speak Of his own being? Words are blind and weak, Perplexing phantoms, dim as smoke to fire, Mocking our tears, and torturing our desire, When soul with soul would mingle: even Love Never availed yet, howsoe'er he strove, But, like the moon, to yield one radiant part To the dark longing of the embracing heart. And Earth, shall her vast secret open lie Before the brief gaze of mortality? Yet wayward and self-wise, no sooner stept Into the world, and a few troubles wept, A few unripe joys garnered, a few sins Experienced, the impetuous mind begins Its hasty wisdom; the world's griefs and joys Holds in a balance, and essays to poise. O persevering folly! never sleep Must weigh the lids of that soul who would reap This mystery; deserts vast must she explore, Many far towns, many an unguessed shore, And those deep regions search, more desolate far, Where lives are herded, ignorant what they are, And scarcely disentangling joy from woe; Their being must she put on, if she would know Humanity; most private bliss invade, And with extremest terror be afraid, Blank quiet and fierce rages apprehend. Nor less into the leaping air ascend Of flame-like spirits, and enamoured veins Feel pulse in her; to exquisitest pains Surrender. Then must her fleet impulse find A way into the solitary mind Of creatures, that in thousand thousand forms Dumb life inspires and a brief sunshine warms; And into the blind springs of sap and seed Empty her passion, helpless with their need, Torn with their hunger, thirsting with their thirst; And deeper, whither eye hath never pierced, Search out, amid the unsleeping stir that fills Caves of old ocean and the rooted hills, Whether indeed these streams of being flow From inmost joy or a great core of woe. Not until then is her wide errand sped, Nor even so the supreme verdict said. For far into the outer night must fare The uncompleted spirit, that to dare Has but begun: now her commissioned bark She must adventure on an ocean dark, Illumined only by the driving foam Of stars imprisoned in the invisible home Each of his circle; age be lost in age Ere she accomplish half her pilgrimage; Nor till the last of those uncounted spheres Its incommunicable joys and tears Yield up to her, shall she at length return And homeward heavy with the message burn, And to her wonder-waiting peers rehearse The mighty meaning of the Universe. O lovely Joy! and sweet Necessity, That wakes, empowers, and impassions me, It is enough that this illumined hour I feel my own life open like a flower Within me. Whether the worlds ache or no, Wearing a bright mask over breasts of woe, I have no need to learn; I only gaze Into thine eyes, dear spirit, that dost upraise My spirit; thy bright eyes, that never cease To thrill me with soft moon-like beams of peace. I look in them as into Earth's own eyes; Faith instantly my longing fortifies; And now I think no single day has hours, Nor year has days, nor life has years, for powers Of joy sufficing; for the things begun And waiting to be seen and felt and done. O give me all thy pains, let them be mine, And keep alone beloved delight for thine! I have a flame within me shall transmute All to an ash, that shall bear flower and fruit, While thou look'st on me, while from thee there flows The invisible strength that in my spirit grows, Until like Spring, the blissful prodigal, It burns as it were capable of all That ever could be reached, enjoyed, or won, Or known, or suffered, underneath the sun. But O why tarry we in language vain And speak thus dimly of delight and pain? Those human words have fallen out of sense, Drunk up into intenser elements, As colours perish into perfect light. Now in the visitation of swift sight That makes me for this happy moment wise Beyond all wisdom of philosophies, I feel even through this transitory flesh The pang of my creation dart afresh; The bonds of thought fall off, and I am free; There is no longer grief nor joy for me, But one infinity of life that flows From the deep ocean-heart that no man knows Out into these unnumbered semblances Of earth and air, mountains and beasts and trees, One timeless flood which drives the circling star In furthest heaven, and whose weak waves we are, Mortal and broken oft in sobbing foam, Yet ever children of that central home, Our Peace, that even as we flee, we find; The Road that is before us and behind, By which we travel from ourselves, in sleep Or waking, toward a self more vast and deep. O could my voice but sound to all the earth And bring thy tidings, radiant One, to birth In hearts of men! How would they cast away The shroud that wraps them from the spacious day, Burst the strong meshes they themselves have spun Of idle cares, and step into the sun, And see, and feel, and dedicate no more Their travail to some far imagined shore, Some dreamed-of goal beyond life's eager sphere, For lo! at every hour the goal is here; And as the dark woods tremble to the morn, That shoots into their dewy depths forlorn Along the wind's path bright victorious rays, And in all branches the birds lift their praise, So should they sing, rejoicing to be free, As I, belovèd Muse, rejoice in thee. FEBRUARY MORNING Peacefully fresh, O February morn, Thy winds come to me: quiet the light slants Through silver-bosomed clouds, that slowly borne Across the wide heath, endlessly advance. Now 'tis that pause before the leaping Spring, When over all things waiting comes a hush; And shyly, listen! the one vocal thing, Over his dewy notes lingers the thrush. Now life, with all her hindering riddles, seems Simple as its green budding to the tree. Awhile the Fates forbear, and to my dreams, Sheltered awhile from truth, relinquish me. In haven and at anchor rides my heart, And broods upon its swelling joys apart. MAY EVENING So late the rustling shower was heard; Yet now the aëry west is still. The wet leaves flash, and lightly stirred Great drops out of the lilac spill. Peacefully blown, the ashen clouds Uncurtain height on height of sky. Here, as I wander, beauty crowds In freshness keen upon my eye. Now the shorn turf a glowing green Takes in the massy cedar shade; And through the poplar's trembling screen Fires of the evening blush and fade. Each way my marvelling senses feel Swift odour, light, and luminous hue Of leaf and flower upon them steal: The songs of birds pierce my heart through. The tulip clear, like yellow flame, Burns upward from the gloomy mould: As though for passion forth they came, Red hearts of peonies unfold: And perfumes tender, sweet, intense Enter me, delicate as a blade. The lilac odour wounds my sense, Of the rich rose I am afraid. SEPARATION We parted at golden dawn. I feasted my last on her eyes, And journeyed, journeyed alone: Mountains and cities and skies Hurried with cruel pace, Endless and swift as the years, From the light, from the sun, from her face, My heart full of darkness and tears. In a day, in a night have flown Ages on ages fleet. At dawn I wander alone In a strange, in a silent street. O love, far off in the clime Of our joy, remember, and bend From that early glory of Time To me at his desolate end. FEARS OF LOVE Love grasps my heart in a net Like the strong roots of a flower; So surely his root is set In my spirit, to hold me with power. Yet to-night, O forgive me, Dear! I am troubled, my heart trembles. There flutters within me a fear That Love in vain dissembles. O is it that even our trust, So strongly planted, How steadfast soever, must By its own fear be haunted? As the heart must beat in the breast If the pulse to its life be true, Love must tremble and throb in his nest To be sure of his life-blood anew? THE VISION OF AUGUSTINE AND MONICA Mother, because thine eyes are sealed in sleep, And thy cheeks pale, and thy lips cold, and deep In silence plunged, so fathomlessly still Thou liest, and relaxest all thy will, Is it indeed thy spirit that is flown? And gazing on thy face, am I alone? O wake and tell me it is false: I fear; And yet my heart persuades me thou art near With living love. I cannot weep nor wail, Nor feel thee taken from me; the tears fail Within me, and my lips their moan reject. Nay, as I watch, each instant I expect Thine eyes will shine upon me unaware And thy lips softly part, and to thy hair Laying one hand, like those who come from dreams So bright, that the dim morning only seems, Thou wilt stretch forth the other into mine, And to thy tender gaze thy love resign, And speak, as thou wast wont, in thy low voice Words wise and gentle, and my heart rejoice With comfort poured into a trusted ear. Mother, thou hearest? Surely thou dost hear, Though thy tired eyes, blissfully closed, defer The heavy world, the weight of human lot. A change has fallen, and yet I know not what. The deep communion of thy calm enfolds My spirit also, and suspended holds Lament, that knows not why to weep, yet yearns For something missed, a fear it dimly learns. And yet time has not touched us: the full glow Salutes us, even as when five eves ago, By this same window, over the same seas, With thoughts of home brought by the shadowy breeze From regions dearer than these golden skies, We looked, and the same glory filled our eyes. Even so the sun transfiguring the land Upon the outstretched waters and bright sand Reclined: the same faint odours floated sweet From the green garden flowering at our feet. Silent we gazed, and the serene large air Appeased our thoughts; the burden that they bare Departed: marvelling at our own release We greeted wave and ray as kindred. Peace Descended then, and touched us; and we knew Our joy, attired in light, and felt it true. Dust of the journey, the hot din of Rome Fell from us: with an aspect kind, like home, The silent and interminable sea Our longing matched with his immensity: We followed the far sails that, one by one, Were drawn into the huge and burning sun; And our souls set to freedom; and they cast Away the soiled remembrance of things past, And to the things before, with radiant speed, Ran on as eager as a captive freed, Far to the last horizon's utmost bound, Onward and onward, and no limit found. Then thou rememberest how regarding long This lovely earth, an inward vision strong O'ercame us, till terrestrial beauty took An insubstantial seeming, the far look Of regions known in dream. Forsaking fear We rose together to that ampler sphere, Where the sun burns, and in his train the moon And myriad stars upon the darkness strewn Illumine earth: on splendour past access Of fleshly eye, revolving weariless, We gazed; yet even as we gazed, the pang Of the eternal touched us: then we sprang From those bright circles, and each boundary passed Of sense, and into liberty at last, To our own souls we came, the haunted place Of thought, companionless as ancient space, Her lonely mirror; and uplifted thence Sighed upward to the eternal Effluence Of life, the intense glory that imbues With far-off sheddings of its radiant hues Mortality; that from the trees calls forth Young leaves, and flowers from the untended earth; And from the heart of man, joy and despair, Rapture and adoration, the dim prayer Of troubled lips, tears and ecstatic throes, And fearful love unfolding like the rose, And hymns of peace: whose everlasting power Draws up ten thousand spirits every hour, As the bright vapour from ten thousand streams, Back to their home of homes, where thou with beams Of living joy, O Sun of humankind, Feedest the fainting and world-wounded mind, And from remembrance burnest out all fear. Sustained a moment in that self-same sphere By wings of ecstasy, we hung, we drew Into our trembling souls the very hue Of Paradise, permitted the dear breath Of truth; us also ignorance of death Made mighty, and joy beyond the need of peace. We of the certain light of blessedness A moment tasted: then, since even desire Perishes of its own exceeding fire, Sighing our spirits failed, and fell away, And sank into the tinge of alien day Unwillingly, to memory and the weight Of hope on the unsure heart, to armèd fate, And prisoning time, and to the obscuring sound Of human words, O even to the ground! The flame that fledged to that remotest height Our spirits winged upon impassioned flight, Sped us no more; but yet the usurping press Of mortal hours their wonted heaviness Relaxed, and on our rapture lightly leaned. Now, as we gazed, a glory intervened: We saw, yet saw not: our thoughts lingered, where The rays yet pierced them of celestial air; And with hearts hushed, as children that have learned The meaning of some fear or joy, we turned To one another, and spoke softly, and drew Sighs, when that light smote on our thoughts anew. O could the tumult of the senses sleep, We murmured then: the mutinous body keep Due pace, and this surrounding bath of light, And these unwearying waves of day and night, Following in beauty, the bright death and birth Of suns, the sweet apparel of the earth, Awhile be dimmed: could but the moon forgo Her splendour, and the winds forget to blow, Ocean no more his troubling water heave, And air its many-coloured web unweave, Could but those visions pale that with affright Pierce us, or unapproachable delight, And all disturbing charm that at our eyes Darts arrows, and for ever laughs and flies; Could all be hushed, and memory turn her face, And hope her low flute silence for a space, And the soul slip the clinging leash of thought, And cast the raiment she herself hath wrought, And, as a flower springs upward unaware, Naked ascend into the eternal air: While he, who all this lovely warp of earth With pomp of time inweaves, and still from birth Moves his creation to death's other door, If he through perishable mouths no more Should speak: not dimly through the veil of sense Reported, nor conjectured influence Of stars, nor through the thunder, nor by dream, Nor by whatever of prophetic theme Angel or man melodiously hath sung, But utter very words of his own tongue, And hold communion with the mind he made, As with the light such things as know not shade, O were not this the joy of joy to win, And Paradise indeed to enter in? I too, I too, in my own feverish youth That light desired; and fainted after truth, Unripe in fervour: in a misty morn Of passion and unrestful ferment borne Hither and thither, many uncertain flames Did I pursue, and stumbled among shames, And wandered where my own rash spirit drove, Misleading to sad joys. In love with Love, I looked in many faces, searching him, And passionately embraced with phantoms dim, Nor knew what my heart hungered for. But thou, Who understandest, who beginnest now In glory visible to fill mine eyes, Thou that obscure desire didst authorise, And by degrees unto itself disclose. O by that beam how momentary shows The world: 'tis but the bush that burns with thee: And I the sandals of mortality Long to put off, and with these chains have done, That bind me, and fly homeward to the sun. Mother, but thou? O what a pang is this That wounds me? Mother, of what cup of bliss Hast thou partaken, that I may not taste? O could I penetrate thy peace, and haste Thither where thou art gone! For now in vain My heart swells with unconquerable pain. My desolation now too well I know. I cannot come where my soul chafes to go, But lay my wet cheek down to thine, and feel Thy cold cheek desolate my heart, and steal Peace and delight away. Dost thou not move, Thou that wert used to weep sad tears of love For me that grieved thee? Now thou weep'st no more, But I with all the hurt I caused thee sore, Weep all thy tears afresh. The door is closed Upon me fast, and darkness interposed! Now terrible thy calm seems, and this peace Of night dismays me, longing for release That will not visit me. On earth and skies The hush of slumber falls, on thy closed eyes, My mother, on the shore and on the sea; All things the night appeases, but not me. THE PINE WOODS OF GRIJÒ Our voices break on a stillness bright and strange Of early morning. Pines upon either hand People the sunshine: deep as eye can range, Their lofty throngs in a darkling order stand. Our sandy path, new-washed with rains of night, Already is dry: but dewily shine its banks. And cool, the shadows asleep upon stems upright, Unevenly dapple the silent, endless ranks. The shadows, they lie so lightly, I think if a wind Blew hither, his breath would lift them, as all sad cares Are lifted, blown from the cleared and eager mind, That now unbidden its native pleasure dares. O pines of ardent branches, that plume with green The delicate blue of morning, and softly house The warm light poured from a splendour half unseen; O forest still and scented, hear my vows! My body is warm to my heart, and I rejoice. I clothe myself with the light, as ye are clad: As ye breathe forth your perfume, I my voice Will utter in morning freshness, alert and glad. As the thistledown melts in the air, of very lightness, Is scattered the web that trouble has vainly spun; And my spirit arising bold, and bathed in brightness, Hymns the excellent, sweet, victorious sun. CARVALHOS Earth, I love thee well; And well dost thou requite me. I have no tongue to tell How this day thou hast thrilled With wonder, to delight me, My heart, intensely stilled. On the white-walled knoll I stand And feel beneath me glowing The noon-hushed, lovely land: Hills beyond hills, and few Far towns a faint crest showing Faint in the rounding blue. Blue sea and radiant sky, Blue sky and mountain marry; And the mind, raised up on high, Onward and onward springs; Where'er she choose to tarry, On every side are wings. To the sun the sun-bathed pines Their strength and sweetness render. From where the far foam shines Like the rim of a dazzling shield, All fervent things and tender Life, joy, and perfume yield. Me, too, with mastering charm From husks of dead days freeing, The sun draws up, to be warm And to bloom in this sweet hour; The stem of all my being Waited to bear this flower. DOURO The dripping of the boughs in silence heard Softly; the low note of some lingering bird Amid the weeping vapour; the chill fall Of solitary evening upon all That stirs and hopes and apprehends and grieves, With pining odours of the ruined leaves Have like a dew distilled upon my heart The air of death: but now recoiling start Longing and keen remembrance out of sighs; And forward the desiring spirit flies Toward the wild peace of that illumined shore, Which, left behind her, yet still shines before; To Douro, rushing through the mighty hills. Now his great stream with fancied splendour fills Even this brooding twilight; a swift ghost, Journeying forever to the glimmering coast, Where his majestic voice is heard afar, Exulting dim upon that ocean bar. O Douro, gliding by dark woods, and fleet Beneath thy shadowy rocks in the noon heat, How my heart faints to follow after thee On one true course to my deep destined sea! To take no care of dimness or sunshine, Urged ever by an inward way divine, Nor falter in this heavy gloom that brings So thick upon me lamentable things Of earth, and hinders the swift spirit's wings, And clouds the steadfast vision that sustains Alone the trembling heart amid perpetual pains. Dear friend, who thirstest, even as I, to be Heir and possessor of sweet liberty, Once more in memory let us pluck the hour That bloomed so perfect, and renew the power Of joy within our wondering breasts, to feel That freshness of eternal things, and heal All our unhappy thoughts in those pure rays. Not yet the last of these delightful days Into the dark unwillingly has flown, And thou and I upon a hill o'ergrown, That indolently shadows Douro stream, Together watch the wonderful clear dream Of evening. Under the dark shore of pines Noiselessly running, the wide water shines. Curving afar, from where the mountains lift Their burning heads, through many a forest rift The River comes, scenting the spaces free In this broad channel, of his welcoming sea. No more by silent precipices hewn Out of the night, murmuring a lonely tune To craggy Fregeneda; nor where shines Regoa, throned among her purple vines, Impetuously seeking valleys new; But smoothing his broad mirror to the hue And peace of heaven, unhasting now he flows And with the sky unfathomably glows, Even as on yonder shore the woods receive In their empurpled bosoms the warm eve. As when a lover gazes tenderly Upon his loved one, and, as tender, she Hushes her heart, her joy to realize, So hushed, so lovely, so contented lies Earth, by that earnest-gazing glory blest. But on this hither bank that fervent West Is hidden behind us, and the stems around Spring shadowy from the bare and darkling ground. Only a single pine out of the shade Emerges, in what splendour soft arrayed! Magical clearness, warming to the sight As to the touch it would be: plumed with light, Motionless upward the tree soars and burns. But now the dews upon the freshened ferns In the dim hollow gather, and cool scent Of herbage with the pine's pure odour blent, And voices of the villagers below As home, with music, up the stream they row, Greet us descending; every blossom sleeps, And bluer and more blue the evening steeps Water and fragrant grass and the straight stems In tender mystery. Down a path that hems The hollow, to our waiting boat we come. Pale purple flames shining amid the gloom Signal the autumn crocus: look, afar, Betwixt the tree-tops, the first-ventured star! Soon gliding homeward under shadowy shores And deepened sky, to the repeated oars' Strong chime we hasten. Now along pale sand Our ripple leaps in silver; now the land, High over the swift water darkly massed, Echoes our falling blades as we go past; Until, enthroned upon her hills divine, The city nears us: lights begin to shine Scarce from the stars distinguished, so the gloom Has mingled earth and sky; more steeply loom The banks on either side, at intervals Tufted with trees, or crowned with winding walls; And now at last the river opens large, Filled with the city's murmur; from his marge, Slope over slope, the glimmering terraces Rise, and their scattered lamps' bright images Cast on the wavering water; and we hear The sound of soft bells, and cries faint or near From the dim wharves, or anchored ships, whose spars Entangle in dark meshes the white stars. And pale smoke rising blue on the blue air Sleeps in a thin cloud under heights that bear Towers and roofs lofty against the west, Where yet a clearness lingers. Now the breast Of Douro heaves, foreboding whither bound His currents hasten, and with joyous sound, As though the encountering brine new pulses gave, Lifts, to outrace our speed, his buoyant wave. For, hearken, up the peaceful evening borne Out of the wide sea-gates, low thunders warn Of Ocean beating with his sleepless surge Along the wild sand-marges: the deep dirge Of mariners, that wakes the widow's ear At night, far inland, terrible and near. Fainter, this eve, he murmurs than as oft His troubled music: here, by distance soft, The abrupt volley, the sharp shattering roar, And seethe of foam flung tumbling up the shore, Mingle in one wide rumour, that all round Is heard afar, robing the air with sound. Deep in my heart I hear it. The still night Deepens, as we ascend the homeward height, And loud or low, in following intervals, Over the hills the sound unwearied falls; And as upon my bed my heavy eyes Close up, the drowsing mind re-occupies. O what a vision floats into my sleep! As a night-shutting flower, my senses keep The live day's lingering odours and warm hues, That thought and motion with themselves transfuse, Till sound and light and perfume are but one, Mingled in fires of the embracing sun. Yet still I am aware of Ocean stirred Far off, and like a grave rejoicing heard. Am I awake, or in consenting dreams Pour thither all my thought's tumultuous streams? His voice, to meet them, a deep answer sends: My soul, to listen, her light wing suspends, And, pillowed upon undulating sound, For all desire hath satisfaction found. He calls her thither, where the winds uncage Vast longing, that the unsounded seas assuage. Breeze after breeze her wingèd pinnace bears Over the living water, that prepares Still widening mystery: she her speed the more Urges, exulting to have lost the shore, Supported by the joy that sets her free, Delighted mistress of her destiny, Fills the wide night with beating of her wing, And is content, for ever voyaging By timeless courses, over worlds unknown, Lifted and lost, abounding and alone. NATURE Because out of corruption burns the rose, And to corruption lovely cheeks descend; Because with her right hand she heals the woes Her left hand wrought, loth nor to wound nor mend; I praise indifferent Nature, affable To all philosophies, of each unknown; Though in my listening ear she leans to tell Some private word, as if for me alone. Still, like an artist, she her meaning hides, Silent, while thousand tongues proclaim it clear; Ungrudging, her large feast for all provides; Tender, exultant, savage, blithe, austere, In each man's hand she sets its proper tool, For the wise, wisdom, folly for the fool. BOOK II (1897–1903) TRISTRAM'S END I Tristram lies sick to death; Dulled is his kingly eye, Listless his famed right arm: earth-weary breath Hath force alone to sigh The one name that re-kindles life's low flame, Isoult!—And thou, fair moon of Tristram's eve, Who with that many-memoried name didst take A glory for the sake Of her who shone the sole light of his days and deeds, Thou canst no more relieve This heart that inly bleeds With all thy love, with all thy tender lore, No, nor thy white hands soothe him any more. Still, the day long, she hears Kind words that are more sharp to her than spears. Ah, loved he more, he had not been so kind! And still with pricking tears She watches him, and still must seem resigned; Though well she knows what face his eyes require, And jealous pangs, like coiled snakes in her mind, Cling tighter, as that voice more earnestly Asks heavy with desire From out that passionate past which is not hers, “Sweet wife, is there no sail upon the sea?” Tenderest hearts by pain grow oft the bitterest, And haste to wound the thing they love the best. At evening, at sun-set, to Tristram's bed News on her lips she brings! She comes with eyes bright in divining dread, Hardening her anguished heart she bends above his head. “O Tristram!”—How her low voice strangely rings!— “There comes a ship, ah, rise not, turn not pale. I know not what this means, it is a sail Black, black as night!” She shot her word, and fled. But Tristram cried With a great cry, and rose upon his side. “It cannot be, it cannot, shall not be! I will not die until mine own eyes see.” Despair, more strong than hope, lifts his weak limbs; He stands and draws deep effort from his breath, He trembles, his gaze swims, He gropes his steps in pain, Nigh fainting, till he gain Salt air and brightness from the outer door That opens on the cliff-built bastion floor And the wide ocean gleaming far beneath. He gazes, his lips part, And all the blood pours back upon his heart. Close thine eyes, Tristram, lest joy blind thee quite! So swift a splendour burns away thy doubt. Nay, Tristram, gaze, gaze, lest bright Truth go out Ere she hath briefly shone. White, dazzling white, A sail swells onward, filling all his sight With snowy light! As on a gull's sure wing the ship comes on; She towers upon the wave, she speeds for home. Tristram on either doorpost must sustain His arms for strength to gaze his fill again. She shivers off the wind; the shining foam Bursts from her pitching prow, The sail drops as she nears, Poised on the joyous swell; and Tristram sees The mariners upon the deck; he hears Their eager cries: the breeze Blows a blue cloak; and now Like magic brought to his divining ears, A voice, that empties all the earth and sky, Comes clear across the water, “It is I!” Isoult is come! Victorious saints above, Who suffered anguish ere to bliss you died, Have pity on him whom Love so sore hath tried, Who sinned yet greatly suffered for his love. That dear renouncèd love when now he sees, Heavy with joy, he sinks upon his knees. O had she wings to lift her to his side! But she is far below Where the spray breaks upon the rusted rail And rock-hewn steps, and there Stands gazing up, and lo! Tristram, how faint and pale! A pity overcomes her like despair. How shall her strength avail To conquer that steep stair, Dark, terrible, and ignorant as Time, Up which her feet must climb To Tristram? His outstretching arms are fain To help her, yet are helpless; and his pain Is hers, and her pain Tristram's; with long sighs She mounts, then halts again, Till she have drawn strength from his love-dimmed eyes: But when that wasted face anew she sees, Despair anew subdues her knees: She fails, yet still she mounts by sad degrees, With all her soul into her gaze upcast, Until at last, at last... What tears are like the wondering tears Of that entranced embrace, When out of desolate and divided years Face meets belovèd face? What cry most exquisite of grief or bliss The too full heart shall tell, When the new-recovered kiss Is the kiss of last farewell? II Isoult O Tristram, is this true? Is it thou I see With my own eyes, clasp in my arms? I knew, I knew that this must be. Thou couldst not suffer so, And I not feel the smart, Far, far away. But oh, How pale, my love, thou art! Tristram 'Tis I, Isoult, 'tis I That thee enfold. I have seen thee, my own life, and yet I die. O for my strength of old! O that thy love could heal This wound that conquers me! But the night is come, I feel, And the last sun set for me. Isoult Tristram, 'twas I that healed thy hurt, That old, fierce wound of Morolt's poisoned sword. Stricken to death, pale, pale as now thou wert: Yet was thy strength restored. Have I forgot my skill? This wound shall yet be healed. Love shall be master still, And Death again shall yield! Tristram Isoult, if Time could bring me back That eve, that first eve, and that Irish shore, Then should I fear not, no nor nothing lack, And life were mine once more. But now too late thou art come; Too long we have dwelt apart; I have pined in an alien home: This new joy bursts my heart. Isoult Hark, Tristram, to the breaking sea! So sounded the dim waves, at such an hour On such an eve, when thy voice came to me First in my father's tower. I heard thy sad harp from the shore beneath, It stirred my soul from sleep. Then it was bliss to breathe; But now, but now, I weep. Tristram Shipwrecked, without hope, without friend, alone On a strange shore, stricken with pang on pang, I stood sad-hearted by that tower unknown, Yet soon for joy I sang. For could I see thee and on death believe? Ah, glad would I die to attain The beat of my heart, that eve, And the song in my mouth again! Isoult Young was I then and fair, Thou too wast fair and young; How comely the brown hair Down on thy shoulder hung! O Tristram, all grows dark as then it grew, But still I see thee on that surge-beat shore; Thou camest, and all was new And changed for evermore. Tristram Isoult, dost thou regret? Behold my wasted cheek. With salt tears it is wet, My arms how faint, how weak! And thou, since that far day, what hast thou seen Save strife, and tears, and failure, and dismay? Had that hour never been, Peace had been thine, this day. Isoult Look, Tristram, in my eyes! My own love, I could feed Life well with miseries So thou wert mine indeed. Proud were the tears I wept; That day, that hour I bless, Nor would for peace accept One single pain the less. Tristram Isoult, my heart is rent. What pangs our bliss hath bought! Only joy we meant, Yet woe and wrong we have wrought. I vowed a vow in the dark, And thee, who wert mine, I gave For a word's sake, to King Mark! Words, words have digged our grave. Isoult Tristram, despite thy love, King Mark had yet thine oath. Ah, surely thy heart strove How to be true to both. Blame not thyself! for woe 'Twixt us was doomed to be. One only thing I know; Thou hast been true to me. Tristram Accurst be still that day, When lightly I vowed the king Whatever he might pray Home to his hands I'd bring! Thee, thee he asked! And I Who never feared man's sword, Yielded my life to a lie, To save the truth of a word. Isoult Think not of that day, think Of the day when our lips desired, Unknowing, that cup to drink! The cup with a charm was fired From thee to beguile my love: But now in my soul it shall burn For ever, nor turn, nor remove, Till the sun in his course shall turn. Tristram Or ever that draught we drank, Thy heart, Isoult, was mine, My heart was thine. I thank God's grace, no wizard wine, No stealth of a drop distilled By a spell in the night, no art, No charm, could have ever filled With aught but thee my heart. Isoult When last we said farewell, Remember how we dreamed Wild love to have learned to quell; Our hearts grown wise we deemed. Tender, parted friends We vowed to be; but the will Of Love meant other ends. Words fool us, Tristram, still. Tristram Not now, Isoult, not now! I am thine while I have breath. Words part us not, nor vow— No, nor King Mark, but death. I hold thee to my breast. Our sins, our woes are past; Thy lips were the first I prest, Thou art mine, thou art mine at the last! Isoult O Tristram, all grows old, Enfold me closer yet! The night grows vast and cold, And the dew on thy hair falls wet. And never shall Time rebuild The places of our delight; Those towers and gardens are filled With emptiness now, and night! Tristram Isoult, let it all be a dream, The days and the deeds, let them be As the bough that I cast on the stream And that lived but to bring thee to me; As the leaves that I broke from the bough To float by thy window, and say That I waited thy coming—O now Thou art come, let the world be as they! Isoult How dark is the strong waves' sound! Tristram, they fill me with fear! We two are but spent waves, drowned In the coming of year upon year. Long dead are our friends and our foes, Old Rual, Brangian, all That helped us, or wrought us woes; And we, the last, we fall. Tristram God and his great saints guard True friends that loved us well, And all false foes be barred In the fiery gates of hell. But broken be all those towers, And sunken be all those ships! Shut out those old, dead hours; Life, life, is on thy lips! Isoult Tristram, my soul is afraid! Tristram Isoult, Isoult, thy kiss! To sorrow though I was made, I die in bliss, in bliss. Isoult Tristram, my heart must break. O leave me not in the grave Of the dark world! Me too take! Save me, O Tristram, save! III Calm, calm the moving waters all the night On to that shore roll slow, Fade into foam against the cliff's dim height, And fall in a soft thunder, and upsurge For ever out of unexhausted might, Lifting their voice below Tuned to no human dirge; Nor from their majesty of music bend To wail for beauty's end Or towering spirit's most fiery overthrow; Nor tarrieth the dawn, though she unveil To weeping eyes their woe, The dawn that doth not know What the dark night hath wrought, And over the far wave comes pacing pale, Of all that she reveals regarding nought.— But ere the dawn there comes a faltering tread; Isoult, the young wife, stealing from her bed, Sleepless with dread, Creeps by still wall and blinded corridor, Till from afar the salt scent of the air Blows on her brow; and now In that pale space beyond the open door What mute, clasped shadow dulls her to despair By keen degrees aware That with the dawn her widowhood is there? Is it wild envy or remorseful fear Transfixes her young heart, unused to woe, Crying to meet wrath, hatred, any foe, Not silence drear! Not to be vanquished so By silence on the lips that were so dear! Ah, sharpest stab! it is another face That leans to Tristram's piteous embrace, Another face she knows not, yet knows well, Whose hands are clasped about his helpless head, Propping it where it fell In a vain tenderness, But dead,—her great dream-hated rival dead, Invulnerably dead, Dead as her love, and cold, And on her heart a grief heavy as stone is rolled. She bows down, stricken in accusing pain, And love, long-baffled, surges back again Over her heart; she wails a shuddering cry, While the tears blindly rain, “I, I have killed him, I that loved him, I That for his dear sake had been glad to die. I loved him not enough, I could not keep His heart, and yet I loved him, O how deep! I cannot touch him. Will none set him free From those, those other arms and give him me? Alas, I may not vex him from that sleep. He is thine in the end, thou proud one, he is thine, Not mine, not mine! I loved him not enough, I could not hold My tongue from stabbing, and forsook him there. I had not any care To keep him from the darkness and the cold. O all my wretched servants, where were ye? Hath none in my house tended him but she? Where are ye now? Can ye not hear my call? Come hither, laggards all! Nay, hush not so affrighted, nor so stare Upon your lord; 'tis he! Put out your torches, for the dawn grows clear. And set me out within the hall a bier, And wedding robes, the costliest that are In all my house, prepare, And lay upon the silks these princely dead, And bid the sailors take that funeral bed And set it in the ship, and put to sea, And north to Cornwall steer. Farewell, my lord, thy home is far from here. Farewell, my great love, dead and doubly dear! Carry him hence, proud queen, for he is thine, Not mine, not mine, not mine!” Within Tintagel walls King Mark awaits his queen. The south wind blows, surely she comes to-day! No light hath his eye seen Since she is gone, no pleasure; he grows gray; His knights apart make merry and wassail, With dice and chessboard, hound at knee, they play; But he sits solitary all the day, Thinking of what hath been. And now through all the castle rings a wail; The king arises; all his knights are dumb; The queen, the queen is come. Not as she came of old, Sweeping with gesture proud To meet her wronged lord, royally arrayed, And music ushered her, and tongues were stayed, And all hearts beat, her beauty to behold; But mute she comes and cold, Borne on a bier, apparelled in a shroud, Daisies about her sprinkled; and now bowed Is her lord's head; and hushing upon all Thoughts of sorrow fall, As the snow softly, without any word; And every breast is stirred With wonder in its weeping; For by her sleeping side, In that long sleep no morning shall divide, Is Tristram sleeping; Tristram who wept farewell, and fled, and swore That he would clasp his dear love never more, And sailed far over sea Far from his bliss and shame, And dreamed to die at peace in Brittany And to uncloud at last the glory of his name. Yet lo, with fingers clasping both are come, Come again home In all men's sight, as when of old they came, And Tristram led Isoult, another's bride, True to his vow, but to his heart untrue, And silver trumpets blew To greet them stepping o'er the flower-strewn floor, And King Mark smiled upon them, and men cried On Tristram's name anew, Tristram, the king's strong champion and great pride. Silently gazing long On them that wrought him wrong, Still stands the stricken king, and to his eyes Such tears as old men weep, yet shed not, rise: Lifting his head at last, as from a trance, he sighs. “Beautiful ever, O Isoult, wast thou, And beautiful art thou now, Though never again shall I, reproaching thee, Make thy proud head more beautiful to me; But this is the last reproach, and this the last Forgiveness that thou hast. Lost is the lost, Isoult, and past the past! O Tristram, no more shalt thou need to hide Thy thought from my thought, sitting at my side, Nor need to wrestle sore With thy great love and with thy fixèd oath, For now Death leaves thee loyal unto both, Even as thou wouldst have been, for evermore. Now, after all thy pain, thy brow looks glad; But I lack all things that I ever had, My wife, my friend, yea, even my jealous rage; And empty is the house of my old age. Behold, I have laboured all my days to part These two, that were the dearest to my heart. Isoult, I would have fenced thee from men's sight, My treasure, that I found so very fair, The treasure I had taken with a snare: To keep thee mine, this was my life's delight. And now the end is come, alone I stand, And the hand that lies in thine is not my hand.” THE DRYAD What has the ilex heard, What has the laurel seen, That the pale edges of their leaves are stirred? What spirit stole between? O trees upon your circle of smooth green, You stir as youths when beauty paces by, Moving heart and eye To unuttered praise. Was it the wind that parted your light boughs, Some odour to recapture as he strays, Or some fair virgin shape of human brows Yet lost to human gaze? O for that morning of the simple world, When hollow oak and fount and flowering reed Were storied each with glimpses of a face By dropping hair dew-pearled! Strange eyes that had no heed Of men, and bodies shy with the firm grace Of young fawns flying, yet of human kin, Whose hand might lead us, could we only spare Doubt and suspicious pride, a world to win, Where all that lives would speak with us, now dumb For fear of us. O might I yet win there! Wave, boughs, aside! to your fresh glooms I come. But all is lonely here! Yet lonelier is the glade Than the wood's entrance, and more dark appear The hollows of still shade. Ah, yet the nymph's white feet have surely stayed Beside the spring; how solitary fair Shines and trembles there White narcissus bloom! By lichened gray stones, where the glancing stream Swerves over into green wet mossy gloom, Their snowy frail flames on the ripple gleam And all the place illume. Surely her feet a moment rested here! Staying her hand upon a pliant branch, She paused, she listened, and then glided on Half-turned in lovely fear; And her young shoulder shone Like moonbeams that wet sands, foam-bordered, blanch, A sight to stay the beating of the breast! Alas, but mortal eyes may never know That beauty. Hark, what bird above his nest So rapturously sings? Ah, thou wilt tell, Thou perfect flower, whither her footsteps go, And all her thoughts, pure flower, for thou know'st well. White sweetness, richest odours round thee cling. Purely thou breathest of voluptuous Spring! Thou art so white, because thou dost enclose All the advancing splendours of the year; And thou hast burned beyond the reddest rose, To shine so keenly clear. Shadowed within thy radiance I divine Frail coral tinges of the anemone, Dim blue that clouds upon the columbine, And wallflower's glow as of old, fragrant wine, And the first tulip's sanguine clarity, And pansy's midnight-purple of sole star! All these that wander far From thee, and wilder glories would assume, Ev'n the proud peony of drooping plume, Robed like a queen in Tyre, All to thy lost intensity aspire; Toward thee they yearn out of encroaching gloom; They are all faltering beams of thy most perfect fire! And she, that only haunts remote green ways, Is it an empty freedom she doth praise? Doth she, distrustfully averse, despise The common sweet of passion, apt to fault? And turns she from the hunger in love's eyes Pale famine to exalt? Oh no, her bosom's maiden hope is still A morning dewdrop, imaging complete All life, full-stored with every generous thrill; No hope less perfect could her body fill, Nor she be false to her own heart's rich beat. But she is pure because she hath not soiled Hope with endeavour foiled; She not condemns glad love, but with the best Enshrines it, lovelier because unpossest. Where is the joy we meant In our first love, the joy so swiftly spent? It glows for ever in her sacred breast, Untamed to languor's ebb, nor by hot passion rent. O pure abstaining Priestess of delight, That treasurest apart love's sanctity, Art thou but vision of an antique dream, Mated with a song's flight, With beckoning western gleam Or first rose fading from an early sky? Yet we, that are of earth, must seek on earth Our bodied bliss. Nay, thou hast still thine hour; And in a girl's life-trusting April mirth, Or noble boy's clear and victorious eyes, Thou shinest with the charm and with the power Of all that wisdom loses to be wise. AMASIS I “O King Amasis, hail! News from thy friend, the King Polycrates! My oars have never rested on the seas From Samos, nor on land my horse's hoofs, Till I might tell my tale.” Sais, the sacred city, basked her roofs And gardens whispering in the western light; Men thronged abroad to taste the coming cool of night: Only the palace closed Unechoing courts, where by the lake reposed, Wide-eyed, the enthronèd shapes of Memphian deities; And King Amasis in the cloistered shade, That guards them, of a giant colonnade, Paced musing; there he pondered mysteries That are the veils of truth; For mid those gods of grave, ignoring smile Large auguries he spelled, Forgot the spears, the tumults of his youth, And strangled Apries, and the reddened Nile. Now turning, he beheld, Half in a golden shadow and half touched with flame, The white-robed stranger from the Grecian isle, And heard pronounced his name. II “Welcome from Samos, friend! Good news, I think, thou bearest in thy mien,” The king spoke welcoming with voice serene. “How is it with Polycrates, thy lord? Peace on his name attend! Would he were here in Egypt, and his sword Could sheathe, and we at god-like ease discourse Of counsel no ignoble needs enforce, And take august regale Of wisdom from the Powers whose purpose cannot fail. I, too, O man of Samos, bred to war, Passed youth, passed manhood, in a life of blood; But many victories bring the heart no certain good. Would that he too might tease his fate no more, And I might see his face In presence of my land's ancestral Powers,— See, from their countenance, what a grandeur beams! Thou know'st I love thy race; Bright wits ye have, skill in adventurous schemes; But deeper life is ours: Fed by these springs, your strength might bless the world. But lo! The light begins to fade from the high towers. Thy errand let me know.” III “Thus saith Polycrates: The counsel which thou wrotest me is well; For, seeing how full crops my granaries swell, How all winds waft me to prosperity, How I gain all with ease, And my raised banner pledges victory, Thou didst advise me cast away what most Brought pleasure to my eyes and seemed of rarest cost. And after heavy thought I chose the ring which Theodorus wrought, My famous emerald, where young Phaethon Shoots headlong with pale limbs through glowing air, While green waves from beneath toss white drops to his hair. A long time, very loth, I gazed thereon; For this cause, thought I, men most envy me; I took a ship, and fifty beating oars Bore me far out to sea: I stood upon the poop—but wherefore tell What now is rumoured round all Asian shores? Say only I did well, Who the world's envy treasured yet in deep waves drowned. Homeward I came, and mourned within my doors Three days, nor solace found.” IV Amasis without word Listens, dark-browed: the Samian speaks anew: “Let not the king this thing so deeply rue; Truly the gem was of imperial price, Nay even, men averred, Coveted more than wealthy satrapies, Nor twenty talents could its loss redeem: Yet hear! the Gods are more benignant than men dream. Thus saith my lord: The moon Not once had waned, when as I sat at noon Within my palace court above the Lydian bay, They led before me with much wondering noise A fisherman; between two staggering boys Slung heavily a fish he brought, that day Caught in his bursting net, A royal fish for royal destiny! I marvelled; but amaze broke deeper yet To recognize Heaven's hand, When from its cloven belly (surely high In that large grace I stand) Dazzled my eyes with light, my heart with joy, the ring Restored!—Why rendest thou thy robe, and why Lamentest thou, O king?” V “O lamentable news!” Amasis cried; “now have the Gods indeed Doom on thy head, Polycrates, decreed! I feared already, when I heard thy joy Must need stoop down to choose For sacrifice, loss of a shining toy, Searching the suburbs only of content, Not thy heart's home: what God this blindness on thee sent? Gone was thy ring; yet how Was thy soul cleared, or thou more greatly thou? Were vain things vainer, or the dear more dear? Hast thou, bent gazing o'er thy child asleep, Thoughts springing, tender as new leaves? Deep, deep, Deep as thy inmost hope, as thy most sacred fear, Thou shouldst have sought the pain That changes earth's wide aspect in an hour, Heaved by abysmal throes! Ah, then our pleasant refuges are vain; Yet, thrilled, the soul assembles all her power, And cleared by peril glows, Seeing immortal hosts arrayed upon her side! Blind man, the scornful Gods thy offering slight: My fears are certified.” VI Swift are the thoughts of fear. But Fate at will rides swifter far; and lo! Even as Amasis bows to boded woe, Even as his robe, with a sad cry, he rends, The accomplishment is here. The sun that from the Egyptian plain descends, Blessing with holier shade Those strange gods dreaming throned by the vast colonnade, Burns o'er the northern sea, Firing the peak of Asian Mycale, Firing a cross raised on the mountain side! Polycrates the Fortunate hangs there: The false Orœtes hath him in a snare; Now with his quivering limbs his soul is crucified; And in his last hour first He tastes the extremity of loss; he burns With ecstasy of thirst; Nought recks he even of his dearest now, Moaning for breath; no pity he discerns On the dark Persian's brow: Grave on his milk-white horse, in silks of Sidon shawled, The Satrap smiles, and on his finger turns The all-envied emerald. THE BACCHANAL OF ALEXANDER “Alexander, returning from his Indian Conquests, having with infinite difficulty brought his army through the salt deserts of Gedrosia, arrived in the pleasant country of the Carmanians. Some authors tell us, that reclining with his friends upon two chariots chained together, and having his ears entertained by the most delicious music, he led his army through Carmania, the soldiers following him with dances and garlands, in emulation of the ancient Bacchanals of Dionysus.” —Arrian. I A wondrous rumour fills and stirs The wide Carmanian Vale; On leafy hills the sunburnt vintagers Stand listening; silent is the echoing flail Upon the threshing-floors: Girls in the orchards one another hail Over their golden stores. “Leave the dewy apples hanging flushed, Ripe to drop In our baskets! Leave the heavy grapes uncrushed, Leave the darkened figs, a half-pulled crop, Olive-boughs by staves unbeaten, come, All our hills be hushed! For a Conqueror, nay a God, Comes into our land this day, From the Eastern desert dumb, That no mortal ever trod: Come we down to meet him on his way!” From reddening vineyards steeped in sun, Trees that with riches droop, Down the green upland men and maidens run Or under the low leaves with laughter stoop. But now they pause, they hear Far trampling sounds; and many a soft-eyed troop Murmurs a wondering fear. “Wherefore hast thou summoned us afar, Voice so proud? Who are ye that so imperious are? Is it he to whom all India bowed, Bacchus, and the great host that pursue Triumphing, his car; Whom our fathers long foretold? O if it be he, the God indeed, May his power our vines endue With prosperity fourfold. Bring we all ripe offerings for his need!” Slowly along the vine-robed vale move on, Like those that walk in dream, The ranks of Macedon. O much-proved men, why doubt ye truth so sweet? This is that fair Carmania, that did seem So far to gain, yet now is at your feet. 'Tis no Circean magic greenly crowds This vale of elms, the laden vines uprearing, The small flowers in the grass, the illumined clouds, Trembling streams with rushes lined, All in strangeness reappearing Like a blue morn to the blind! Worn feet go happy, and parched throats may laugh, Or blissful cold drops from dipt helmets quaff; Dear comrades, flinging spears down, stand embraced And heap this rich oblivion on the waste Of torment whence they came; That land of salt sand vaulted o'er with flame, That furnace, which for sixty days they pierced, Wrapt in a hot slow cloud of pricking grains, On ever crumbling mounds, through endless plains, And ravening hands scooped fire, not water, for their thirst. Streams of Carmania, never have ye seen Such mirrored rapture of strong limbs unclad, Lips pressing, lover-like, delicious green Of leaves, or breaking into laughter mad; Out-wearied ranks, that couched in gloom serene, Let idle memory toy With torment past whose pangs enrich the gust of joy. II O peerless Alexander! Still From his kindling words they glow. Like a straight shaft to a bow Is their strength unto his will. He hath done what no man ever dared: That fierce desert, where great Cyrus lost All save seven of his unnumbered host, Where the proud Semiramis despaired, He hath brought his thousands through. Vainly, vainly Wind and Fire Stormed against the way of his desire: They at last their tamer knew. O'er mile-broad rivers, like young brooks, he stept, Walls of unconquered cities overleapt. And now Earth yields, for storm and strife and heat, Her greenest valley to his feet. But lo! the soft Carmanian folk, Round these warriors gathering nigh, Down the slopes with murmur shy The benignant God invoke. While they stand in wonder and in doubt, Comes a throng in leaves their heads arraying, Some on pipes and some on tabors playing, “Bacchus, Bacchus is our king,” they shout, “Magic mirth into our blood he pours; Join us, strangers, in our feast! All our parching toil hath ceased. Give us of your fruitful valley's stores!” Apples they heap on shields in golden domes, And spearpoints bear the dripping honeycombs. “Our Bacchus bids you to his joy,” they sing; “Lo, where he comes, the king!” Two massy ivory cars, together bound, Roll through the parting throng; A whole uprooted vine enwreathes them round; Long tendrils over the gold axles trail, While jubilant pipe and chanted song The cars' oncoming hail. By the dark bunches idle helms and greaves Are hung, and swords that on Hydaspes shone; Heroic shoulders gleam betwixt the leaves! There sits reclined on rugs of Susa spread, Throned amid his Seven of Macedon, Alexander! his victorious head Bound with ivy and pale autumn flowers. Ah, what a sunny redolence of showers The wind wafts round him from this promised land! Over Hephæstion's neck is laid one hand, Lightly the other holds a spear; but now No passion fires his eye, nor deep thought knots his brow. Like his own Pella breathes this upland air; A joy-born beauty flushes up his face, O'ersmoothing old fell rages, to replace Youth in lost lines most indolently fair. Remembrance is at peace, desire forgone, And those winged brows their watchful menace ease In languor proud as a storm-sailing swan New lighted on a mere from the wild seas. Beat, thrilling drums, beat low, and pipes sound on, While his full soul doth gaze From this the topmost hour of all his glorious days. III The shy Carmanians awed Gaze on that sun-like head. “Is it he,” they murmur, “who led The mirth of the vineyard abroad? Surely none else may bear So regal a beauty; yet why On us turns not his eye? We have heard that he loves not care, But the dance and idle glee Of the laughing Satyr tribe. Could toil those brows inscribe? Is it he? is it surely he? Are these the revellers of his train? Yet surely these have passed through fire, through pain! Can the Gods also suffer throes, Nor crave to conquer, but repose?” The king uplifts his bowl. Peucestas stoops, pours in From a brown fawn's swelling skin The ripe grape's rosy soul. “Pledge us,” he cries, and smiles, “Lord of Nysa, to-day! Have we not toiled our way To a valley of the Blessed Isles? Drink of a richer boon Than the water we brought thee to taste In the fiery Gedrosian waste When we halted our host at noon, And thou in the sight of all didst spill Those longed-for drops on the darkened sand,—O fill, Remembering how our hearts drank wine From thy refusing deed divine.” What hath the king so stirred? What grief of a great desire Stung by that spoken word? Sudden as storm his thoughts tumultuous run Back into peril, Indus, Issus, Tyre, And the famed gates of Babylon yet unwon. Far, far those mighty days in glory tower! A valley keeps him, while the great peaks call. O for that supreme exultant hour, When alone, Achilles-like, he sprang 'Mid the astonished Indians o'er the wall, And a hundred arrows round him rang! O Alexander, all these thousands own Thy pleasure, but thy throes were thine alone. Dulled is the joy that hath no need to dare; Match thy great self, and breed another heir To those high deeds, from which thy kindled fame Runs, as the world's hope runs from youth to youth aflame. Climb, climb again to those lone eagle skies, Where ocean's unadventured circle bends And dragon ignorance girdles the world's ends!— As fire leaps up a tower, that thought leaps to his eyes. “Off, Mænad mummery,” he cries; his brow Strips of its garland with indignant hands, Starts up, and plants his ringing spear; and now Soul-flushed through radiant limbs, a man transfigured stands. With joy the marvelling Carmanians bow, From their long doubting freed: “It is the God,” they cry, “the enraptured God indeed!” ASOKA I Gentle as fine rain falling from the night, The first beams from the Indian moon at full Steal through the boughs, and brighter and more bright Glide like a breath, a fragrance visible. Asoka round him sees The gloom ebb into glories half-espied Of glimmering bowers through wavering traceries: Pale as a rose by magical degrees Opening, the air breaks into beauty wide, And yields a mystic sweet; And shapes of leaves shadow the pathway side Around Asoka's feet. O happy prince! From his own court he steals; Weary of words is he, weary of throngs. How this wide ecstasy of stillness heals His heart of flatteries and the tale of wrongs! Unseen he climbs the hill, Unheard he brushes with his cloak the dew, While the young moonbeams every hollow fill With hovering flowers, so gradual and so still As if a joy brimmed where that radiance grew, Discovering pale gold Of spikenard balls and champak buds that new Upon the air unfold. He gains the ridge. Wide open rolls the night! Airs from an infinite horizon blow Down holy Ganges, floating vast and bright Through old Magadha's forests. Far below He hears the cool wave fret On rocky islands; soft as moths asleep Come moonlit sails; there on a parapet Of ruined marble, where the moss gleams wet And from black cedars a lone peacock cries, Uncloaking rests Asoka, bathing deep In silence, and his eyes Of his own realm the wondrous prospect reap; At last aloud he sighs. II “How ennobling it is to taste Of the breath of a living power! The shepherd boy on the waste Whose converse, hour by hour, Is alone with the stars and the sun, His days are glorified! And the steersman floating on Down this great Ganges tide, He is blest to be companion of the might Of waters and unwearied winds that run With him, by day, by night: He knows not whence they come, but they his path provide. “But O more noble far From the heart of power to proceed As the beam flows forth from the star, As the flower unfolds on the reed. It is not we that are strong But the cause, the divine desire, The longing wherewith we long. O flame far-springing from the eternal fire, Feed, feed upon my heart till thou consume These bonds that do me wrong Of time and chance and doom, And I into thy radiance grow and glow entire! “For he who his own strength trusts, And by violence hungers to tame Men and the earth to his lusts, Though mighty, he falls in shame; As a great fell tiger, whose sound The small beasts quake to hear, When he stretches his throat to the shuddering ground And roars for blood; yet a trembling deer Brings him at last to his end. In a winter torrent falls his murderous bound! His raging claws the unheeding waters rend; Down crags they toss him sheer, With sheep ignobly drowned, And his fierce heart is burst with fury of its fear. III “Not so ye deal, Immortal Powers, with him Who in his weak hour hath made haste to kneel Where your divine springs out of mystery brim, And carries thence through the world's uproar rude A clear-eyed fortitude; As the poor diver on the Arabian strand From the scorched rocky ledges plunging deep, Glides down the rough dark brine with questing hand Until he feels upleap Founts of fresh water, and his goatskin swells And bears him upward on those buoyant wells Back with a cool boon for his thirsting land. “I also thirst, O living springs, for you: Would that I might drink now, as when at first Life shone about me glorious and all true, And I abounded in your strength indeed, Which now I sorely need. You have not failed, 'tis I! Yet this abhorred Necessity to hate and to despise— 'Twas not for this my youthful longing soared, Not thus would I grow wise! Keep my heart tender still, that still is set To love without foreboding or regret, Even as this tender moonlight is outpoured. “Now now, even now, Sleep doth the sad world take To peace it knows not. Radiant Sleep, wilt thou Unveil thy wonder for me too, who wake? O my soul melts into immensity, And yet 'tis I, 'tis I! A wave upon a silent ocean, thrilled Up from its deepest deeps without a sound, Without a shore to break on, or a bound, Until the world be filled. O mystery of peace, O more profound Than pain or joy, upbuoy me on thy power! Stay, stay, adorèd hour, I am lost, I am found again: My soul is as a fountain springing in the rain.” —Long, long upon that cedarn-shadowed height Musing, Asoka mingled with the night. At last the moon sank o'er the forest wide. Within his soul those fountains welled no more, Yet breathed a balm still, fresh as fallen dew: The mist coiled upward over Ganges shore; And he arose and sighed, And gathered his cloak round him, and anew Threaded the deep woods to his palace door. ORPHEUS IN THRACE I Dear is the newly won, But O far dearer the for ever lost! He that at utmost cost His utmost deed hath done The lost one to recover, and in vain, What shall his heart, his anguished heart, sustain? Not the warm and youthful sun, Flowers breathing on the bough, Nor a voice, nor music now— Touches of joy, more hard to bear than pain! These charm not where he is, but only there Where she is gone, who took with her delight, Peace, and all things fair, And left the whole world bare. And O, what far well's fountain shall requite Him who hath drunk so deeply of despair? Orpheus on a stone-strewn slope High amid the hills of Thrace Sets to the bleak North his face. He a traveller from hope,— As a bird whose mate is stricken Flies and flies o'er ocean foam Nor endures to seek a home,— Seeks a land where no leaves quicken, Where from gorges to the plain Iron-tongued the torrent roars Into troubled streams that strain Eddying under barren shores; Where thronged ridges darkly rise, Shouldering the storms that sweep Through the winter-loaded skies, When far up in heavens asleep For an hour the clouds unclose:— Throned in peace beyond the bourne Of their moving vapours torn, Glimmer the majestic snows, Whence an eagle slowly sails O'er the solitary vales. Such to Orpheus' pilgrim eyes The unreached far mountains rise. “Come,” he groans, “you storms, and scourge me, Dull these inward pangs that urge me Ever into new despair. Make my flesh endure as steel, Let me now the utmost feel, Bring me news of things that bear— Frozen torrents, naked trees That abjure the summer's breeze,— Keen upon this body fall! O let me feel your fiercest sting or feel no more at all!” His hand, half-conscious, straying Over the well-loved lyre, Strikes; frail notes obeying Sadly in air expire. Wingless they falter forth, As the pale large plumes of snow From the dim cloud-curdling North, Unwilling and soft and slow, That fall on the hands and the hair Of Orpheus unheeded, and die, As out of his heart's despair He speaks to his lyre: “Ah, why Would I stir thee from silence now, When silence is far the best? As of old I touch thee, but thou Unwillingly answerest. Ah, marvellous once was thy power In the marvellous days of old! I touched thee, and all hearts heard, And the snake had no thought to devour, And the shy fawn stayed and was bold, And the panther crept near in desire; And the toppling Symplegades hung To hearken thy strings as I sung, And Argo glanced through like a bird, Like a swallow, to hear thee, my lyre! And the soul of the dragon was stirred, Till his vast coil slowly stooped From the tree where the Fleece glimmered gold, And his ageless eyelids drooped, And his strength sank, fold by fold; And only the dim leaves heard, As we stept o'er his coils that were cold. Mighty wast thou indeed; But O, in my utmost need, My heart thou couldst not quell, My heart that loved too well! I turned on the brink of the light; Her hand hung fast in my own; I was sure as a God in my might; I gazed; she grew pale, she was flown. Then the dawn turned back to the night, And I stood in the world alone. Eurydice, could I have loved thee less, I had won thee lightly again. My great joy wrought my wretchedness, And thee, whom I love, I have slain.” II What lights are these that dance, Like fire-flies clustering on the dusk hillside, Mingle and then divide, Swerve and again advance, Peopling the shadows thick, till Rhodope Seems rocking all her towering pines in glee? Mænads of exultant glance, Thracian maidens, Thracian dames, Toss these perilous fair flames. Soon their full tresses roll from neck to knee, Swift as a dark shower in the sunset poured; Soon panting bosoms from rent robes shine bare! Thoughts leap in accord, Bright as an unsheathed sword, Tumultuously free, and mad to dare; And loud they cry on Bacchus, their wild lord. O can cheeks of white and red, Lips that love made tremble often, Eyes an infant's tears can soften, Alter with a change so dread? Yea, a deep fire craving fuel, Like the dungeoned fires of Earth, Pants from secrecy for birth, Careless if its way be cruel. While from tempest faint they stand, Orpheus 'mid their riot strays, Silent halts with listless hand And with sorrow-sunken gaze. “Who is this?” in wrath they cry, “Spectre sprung to mock our glee! Woe to this pale face, for he Joins our mirth or he shall die!”— Singer, touch thy magic lyre! Thou couldst stay them soft and still, Tamed and gentle, to thy will. Ah, in grief is no desire. Grief in stony bonds hath bound him, And these bright forms that surround him With high torches menacing And light spears in restless ring, Seem his own thoughts raging, seem Furies of embodied dream, Furies whom 'tis vain to flee. Alas, he hath for shield and sword Only one defenceless word, “Eurydice, Eurydice!” To piercing wound and branding flame He answers with that piteous name The world now echoes back alone. “Eurydice!” his soul flies forth in that belovèd moan. Alas, that the hand should deflower The treasure the heart loves best, That the will of an alien power Should blindly the soul have possest! Proudly our own great woe We accomplish, and laugh to have done. Then strength passes from us; we know, And we hide our heads from the sun. Behold, as the dawn-flushed air Glimmers on peak and vale, To the pines on the upland bare Come shadowy forms and pale; Stealing, maiden and mother, By single paths of dread, And wondering each at the other Bend over the piteous dead, And touching those rent limbs, cry, With kisses kneeling low, In sad affrighted moan, “It was not I!” “Nor I!” What evil God blinded us so To wound our beloved, our delight? For our dancing thou hadst not a song, And now we have none for thy wrong. Though thy lyre could charm honey from stone, Yet we pitied not thee, our delight! Nay, thee who couldst heal us alone In our grief, at whose magical boon Peace brooded a dove o'er our pain, And our hearts with the sun and the moon Were at peace, that shall be not again, Nor our hope with the spring be in tune; Thee, thee, even thee, have we slain! Woe for the world, woe! In cherishing fair snow Let us bury thee whom we marred, With the lyre that our flame hath charred. Gentle wast thou as a flower, But careless as thunder were we; And our tears, that should be as a shower To raise and to foster thee, Drop vainly, and past is our power With that blindness and fury and glee. Yea, the solace we wanted not then in our mirth From our helpless sorrow is taken; And for ever untuned is the beautiful earth, And the home of our hearts is forsaken. AUTUMN MOONRISE Lamp that risest lone From thy secret place, Like a sleeper's face, Charged with thoughts unknown, Strange thoughts, unexpressed In thy brightening beam, Strangeness more than dream Upon earth e'er guessed! Strange thou gleam'st as some Eastern marble old, Scrawled with runes that hold Histories, yet are dumb. But thy viewless hand Out of whelming night Waves the woods to light, Summons up the land! Sea, that merged in sky; To its far bound shines; And thy touch defines Our infinity. Now the murmuring coast Glistens; rocks are there; And what most was bare Thou enrichest most. Far through granite caves Diving glide thy beams, Till the dark roof gleams Laced with hovering waves, O'er the white walls glide, Through the lattice creep, Where the lovers sleep, Bridegroom by his bride. Soft their wakened eyes From a deep bliss gaze On those marvellous rays New from Paradise. In the self-same hour, Whitening Russian plains, On sad exile trains Thou hast also power. No more kindly gloom Veils from them despair: Near and clear and bare They behold their doom. Bowed, they see their own Shadows on the snow, And the way they go, Endlessly alone: Aching, chained, footsore, Through the waste they wind, All their joy behind, Nought but grief before. O thou sleeper's face Whence hast thou this gift So much to uplift, And so much to abase? Lovers' happier dream, Exiles' heavier pain, Thou on each dost rain Beam on radiant beam! Changed in thy control, Though no leaf hath stirred, Though no breath was heard, Lie both world and soul. THE BELFRY OF BRUGES Keen comes the dizzy air In one tumultuous breath. The tower to heaven lies bare; Dumb stir the streets beneath. Immeasurable sky Domes upward from the dim Round land, the astonished eye Supposes the world's rim. And through the sea of space Winds drive the furious cloud Silent in endless race; And the tower rocks aloud. Mine eye now wanders wide, My thought now quickens keen. O cities, far descried, What ravage have you seen Of an enkindled world? Homes blazing and hearths bare; Of hosts tyrannic hurled On pale ranks of despair, Who fed with warm proud blood The cause unquenchable, For which your heroes stood, For which our Sidney fell; Sidney, whose starry fame, Mirrored in noble song, Shines, all our sloth to shame, And arms us against wrong; Bright star, that seems to burn Over yon English shore, Whither my feet return, And my thoughts run before; Run with this rumour brought By the wild wind's alarms, Dark sounds with battle fraught, Menace of distant arms. O menace harsh, but vain! For what can peril do But search our souls again To sift and find the true? Prove if the sap of old Shoots yet from the old seed, If faith be still unsold, If truth be truth indeed? Welcome the blast that shakes The wall wherein we have lain Slumbering, our heart awakes And rends the prison chain. Turn we from prosperous toys And the dull name of ease; Rather than tarnished joys Face we the angry seas! Or, if old age infirm Be in our veins congealed, Bow we to Time, our term Fulfilled, and proudly yield. Not each to each we are made, Not each to each we fall, But every true part played Quickens the heart of all That feeds and moves and fires The many-peopled lands, And in our languor tires But in our strength expands. For forward-gazing eyes Fate shall no terror keep. She in our own breast lies: Now let her wake from sleep! TO THE SUMMER NIGHT A sultry perfume of voluptuous June Enchants the air still breathing of warm day; But now the impassioned Night draws over, soon To fold me, in this high hollow, quite away From oaken groves beneath and glimmering bay And valley rock-bestrewn; From all but shadowy leaves and scented ground And this intense blue slowly deepening round, From all but thoughts of beauty and delight And thee that stealest as with hair unbound O'er the hushed earth, and lips sighing, enamoured Night. Not the fair vestal of the Spring's cold sky, But flushed from the ancestral East, thy home, Drowsing the land, thou stirrest joy to a sigh, Longing to passion and wild thoughts, that roam As through those hungering Asian forests come Panthers of ardent eye; While over worlds wandering extravagant, Like some divine and naked Corybant, Thou movest; dark woods tremble and suspire; And mortal spirits for life's full fountain pant, As in content awakes the genius of desire. Richer than jewelled Indian realm is thine, O stepper from the mountain-tops! for whom On viewless branches of the heavenly vine The white stars cluster faint or thickly bloom Through the sapphire abyss of glowing gloom. Press out a magic wine For me—I thirst—from that intensest height, Where even our keen thought, outsoaring sight, Faints and despairs, ay, from some virgin star Brim me a cup of that untreasured light Lone in a world unreached, abounding, and afar! Most far is now most dear. Blot out the near! Lost is the earth beneath me, lost the day's Removed ambition, all that fretful sphere Drowned in the dark, and quenched its trivial praise. I would behold beyond a mortal's gaze, Behold ev'n now, ev'n here, The beauty strange, the ecstasy extreme, Of what should this divine gloom best beseem, The bosom of a Goddess, or her hair, Invisible and fragrant—gliding dream, Yet near as my heart beating, of such charm aware. Why have we toiled so patiently to bend This bow of arduous life? Unto what mark? For what have set to our desire no end, Steered to the utmost stormy sea our bark, Piercing with eagle thought the frozen dark, Been bold and gay to spend Our warm blood, hazarded wild odds, and let The bright world perish? What far prize to get? What thing is this no speech could ever frame, Nor hundred creeds ever imprison yet? We breathe for it, and die, yet never named its name. Star-trembling Night, Mother of songs unsung And leaves unborn beneath the barren rind, Who findest for forbidden hope a tongue, Who treasurest most the treasure undivined And flowers that banquet but the careless wind; To whom all joy is young; Prophetess of the fire that one day leaping Shall burn the world's corruption, of the sleeping Swords that shall strike down tyrants from their throne, Mother of faith, our frail thought onward sweeping, Breathe nearer, whisper close, spells of the dear unknown. O of thy fated children number me! Now while the alien day deep-sunken lies And only the awakened soul may see, Far from the lips that flatter or despise, Foster my fond hope with thy certainties, From time's subjection free, That I may woo from some bare branch a flower, Yea, from this world a beauty and a power She gives not of herself; sustain me still Through the harsh day, through every taming hour, To find thy promise truth, thy secret grace fulfil. THE SNOWS OF SPRING O wailing gust, what hast thou brought with thee, What sting of desolation? But an hour, And brave was every shy new-opened flower Smiling in sun beneath a budding tree. Now over black hills the skies stoop and lour; Now on this lonely upland the shrill blast Thrusts under brown dead crumpled leaves to find Soft primroses that were unfolding fast; Now the fair Spring cries through the shuddering wood Lamenting for her darlings to the wind That ravishes their youth with laughter rude. The whole air darkens, sweeping up in storm. What breath is this of what far power that slays? What God in blank and towering cloud arrays His muffled, else intolerable form? What beautiful Medusa's frozen gaze? Lo, out of gloom the first flakes floating pale, Lost like a dreamer's thoughts! They shall lie deep To-morrow on green shoot, on petal frail And living branches borne down in despair By the mere weight of that soft-nesting sleep, Though all the earth look still and white and fair. Phantasmal and extreme as some blind plain Upon the far side of the moon, unknown Deep Polar solitudes of ice enthrone In the white night of mountain and moraine The power of that cold Sleep that dwells alone, Absolute in remotest idleness. Yet from his fancied lips the freezing breath Wandering about the world's warm wilderness Has drifted on the north wind even hither These gently whispering syllables of death Among the English flowers, our Spring to wither. Not only the brief tender flowers, ah me! Suffer such desolation, but we too Who boast our godlike liberty to do Whate'er we will, and range all climes, ev'n we Must still abide its coming and our rue. It breathes in viewless winds and gently falls Over our spirits, till desire grown sere, Faith frozen into words, custom like walls Of stone imprison us, and we acquiesce. More than the raging elements to fear Is snow-soft death that comes like a caress. Life lives for ever: Death of her knows naught. Our souls through radiant mystery are led, Clothed in fresh raiment as the old is shed. But Death the unchanging has no aim, no thought, Deaf, blind, indifferent, feeds not yet is fed, Moves not yet crushes, is not rent yet rends: For as from icebergs killing airs are blown, His cold sleep to our life-warm ardour sends Frost wreathing round us delicate as rime, Making most real what should be dream alone To the free spirit, the gnawing tooth of time. Who shall escape, since death and life inweave Their threads so subtly? Yet may truth be wooed In our own natures, shaken off the brood Of thoughts not ours, beliefs our lips believe But our hearts own not,—alien fortitude. These are of death; and with his realm conspire Faint souls that drowse in ignorance unjust, That with the world corrupt their true desire, And dully hate and stagnantly despise. Already they begin to die, to rust; But those that love are always young and wise. O Love, my Love, the dear light of whose eyes Shines on the world to show me all things new, Falsehood the falser and the true more true, And tenfold precious all my soul must prize, Since from our life's core love so deeply grew, O let us cleave fast to the heavenly powers That brought us this, whose unseen spirit flows Pure as the wind and sensitive as flowers. They are with us! Let the storm-gathering night Cover the bleak earth with these whirling snows, Our hands are joined, our hearts are brimmed with light. A VISION OF RESURRECTION The Genius of an hour that fading day Resigned to wide-haired Night's impending brow Stole me apart, I knew not where nor how, And from my sense ravished the world away. Rose in my view a visionary ground, A rugged plain, beneath uncoloured skies. There slowly in the midst without a sound Upheaved a motion as of birth. I gazed, When lo! a head, with upcast empty eyes And semblance of dead shoulders' majesties, Whose fleshless arms a marble breast upraised. But even as this emerged, nor yet was free, Behold it ripen into bloom and form, The shrunk limbs round and into colour warm, The hair spring new as leaves upon a tree, And curl like small flames round the forehead fair. At last the eyelids open wide: it seems A glorious-statured youth that wakens there, Casting his eyes in wonder down, to feel This body that with clear blood newly teems, How perfect, yet still heavy as from dreams, And over it the ancient beauty steal. O lost in musing recollection sweet, What summoning cry thine age-long slumber stirred? In that profound grave has thy cold ear heard From heaven the mailed Archangel call, whose feet Stand planted in the stream of stars, and whose Time-shattering trump hath pealed to the world's core? Yet still doth thy averted head refuse To lift its eyes up; still thy spread hands lean On earth, while pensive thou surveyest o'er This radiant shape that all thy sorrows bore, Strong now as if no pain had ever been. What thoughts begin to glide upon thy brain, And part thy lips with sighs? Is it some fear 'Mid flattering heavenly airs approaching near This strange unproven peace to entertain? Musing, “O rebel flesh, in my hard need How often didst thou fail me! I know well How thou didst make me suffer toil and bleed, At once my prison and my enemy. Dear body, I fear thee yet: dark rages dwell Within thee: how shalt thou in peace excel? How learn to bear perfect felicity?” Nay, rather that fond wonder in thy look Is wonder to have lost the thoughts that maim, The wounds of evilly-invented shame And fear that each sweet impulse overtook. Now thou art free, and all thy being whole, Perceivest in that peril-haunted earth The fair and primal gestures of thy soul, And knowest how all thy full completion fed, The urging hungers, the sun-sweetened mirth; Yea, finding even in those furies worth, Which lacking, hardly art thou perfected. What trees are these whose dim young branches rise Above thee? Springing waters freshen sweet New tender green for thee to pace and greet The growing of the dawn of Paradise. Thou gazest round thee with a listening face, Hearkening perhaps to some far-floating song Unheard of men. Ah, go not ere thy grace, O glorified, of me be throughly learned! But as I prayed in supplication strong The vision faded, and the world, whose wrong Mocks holy beauty and our desire, returned. QUEEN VENUS Queen Venus on a day of cloud Forsook heaven's argent palaces, Beneath the roofing vapours bowed And sought a promontory loud Far in the utmost seas. There to a caverned shore she made retreat, Where granite shoulders of the mountain slant Down to wet ledges that the waters beat, Haunted of gull and diving cormorant. Her garment was of green that deeply glowed; One foot beneath its fluttering border showed, As on a rocky solitary seat, Sitting with both hands clasped about her knee, She gazed unmoving over restless sea, Heard not the wild birds scream and circling soar Up the black cliffs and round their craggy tops, But watched the full waves towering toward the shore, Heaved up and ever falling in dumb roar, And snowed into a thousand stormy drops. Gardens of sultry Paphos, far away Your doves among the strewn rose-petals play! But doves nor roses please her heart to-day, Who, child of ocean, comes to taste once more The sting and splendour of the ocean spray. Out of the cold mist curling, The waters onward hurling, As if a wizard driving A myriad rebel spirits swept them thither, Mounting, despairing, crying, and ever striving, Swell toward her feet and in a moment wither. But idly in the wells of Venus' eyes Those perishing proud glories fall and rise. Like to a mirror where have come and gone Faces of pain and passion, nor have left Of all the abandoned story of their sighs An image more than where a moonbeam shone, She sees, she hearkens, but of thought bereft; Her gaze holds neither pity, fear, nor wonder: Yet in the exultation and the thunder Of those waves moving as to music rolled, Wherein their briefness is a tone half-told, A spirit lives that doth her spirit claim; Then she remembers how she also came From deep-moved waters tossing and uptorn, And 'mid such bitter idle foam was born The serene charm that sets the world aflame. THE BELFRY Dark is the stair, and humid the old walls Wherein it winds, on worn stones, up the tower. Only by loophole chinks at intervals Pierces the late glow of this August hour. Two truant children climb the stairway dark, With joined hands, half in glee and half in fear, The boy mounts brisk, the girl hangs back to hark If the gruff sexton their light footstep hear. Dazzled at last they gain the belfry-room. Barred rays through shutters hover across the floor Dancing in dust; so fresh they come from gloom That breathless they pause wondering at the door. How hushed it is! What smell of timbers old From cobwebbed beams! The warm light here and there Edging a darkness, sleeps in pools of gold, Or weaves fantastic shadows through the air. How motionless the huge bell! Straight and stiff, Ropes through the floor rise to the rafters dim. The shadowy round of metal hangs, as if No force could ever lift its gleamy rim. A child's awe, a child's wonder, who shall trace What dumb thoughts on its waxen softness write In such a spell-brimmed, time-forgotten place, Bright in that strangeness of approaching night? As these two gaze, their fingers tighter press; For suddenly the slow bell upward heaves Its vast mouth, the cords quiver at the stress, And ere the heart prepare, the ear receives Full on its delicate sense the plangent stroke Of violent, iron, reverberating sound. As if the tower in all its stones awoke, Deep echoes tremble, again in clangour drowned, That starts without a whir of frighted wings And holds these young hearts shaken, hushed, and thrilled, Like frail reeds in a rushing stream, like strings Of music, or like trees with tempest filled, And rolls in wide waves out o'er the lone land, Tone following tone toward the far-setting sun, Till where in fields long-shadowed reapers stand Bowed heads look up, and lo, the day is done. LOOK NOT TOO DEEP Look not too deep in my heart, My beloved; nay, lean not too near From the shores of thy peace, lest thou start From the midst of thy sweet thoughts to hear The sound of waters of pain, Blindly knocking and thronging, The waters of heavy longing, That deep in my heart has lain. Sleeplessly circle the waves Far under, and dumbly resound In throats of the sea-filled caves, Where daylight wholly is drowned, Where frail fair shells are scattered And broken in random foam, With weeds that have found no home, And drift-wood of ships long shattered. But I would, my belov'd, that for thee, Who bring'st me a sky all blue, My spirit were stilled as a sea That the fires of the noon warm through, When the waves have forgotten their sighs And from shore unto shore are at rest, As my whole soul bathes and is blest In the peace of thy beautiful eyes. HAREBELL AND PANSY O'er the round throat her little head Its gay delight upbuoys: A harebell in the breeze of June Hath such melodious poise; And chiming with her heart, my heart Is only hers and joy's. But my heart takes a deeper thrill, Her cheek a rarer bloom, When the sad mood comes rich as glow Of pansies dipped in gloom. By some far shore she wanders—where? And her eyes fill—for whom? GRIEF Grief is like a child, Led with relentless hand By a strange nurse, whose face Seems never to have smiled, Whose onward gaze severe Slackens not, nor her pace, Nor that child's faltering fear Stoops she to understand. So strides the world, while grief Unwilling is borne on, With ever lingering mind, Through the strange days, alone. Oh, like a fluttering leaf On the ways of the strong wind, Or pebbles helpless thrown By night on a wild strand, Lost are the thoughts of grief, That none can understand! LAMENT Fall now, my cold thoughts, frozen fall My sad thoughts, over my heart, To be the tender burial Of sweetness and of smart. Fall soft as the snow, when all men sleep, On copse and on bank forlorn, That tenderly buries, yet buries deep Frail violets, freshly born. SURSUM COR! Lament no more, my heart, lament no more, Though all these clouds have covered up the light, And thou, so far from shore, Art baffled in mid flight; Still proudly as in joy through sorrow soar! As the wild swan, Voyaging over dark and rising seas, Into the stormy air adventures on With wide unfaltering wings, the way he bore When blue the water laughed beneath the breeze And morning round the radiant beaches shone, So thou through all this pain Endure, my heart, whither thy course was bound; Though never may the longed-for goal be found, Thy steadfast will maintain. Thou must not fail, for nothing yet hath failed Which was to thee most dear and most adored; Still glorious is Love, thy only lord, Truth still is true, and sweetness still is sweet: The high stars have not changed, nor the sun paled. Still warmly, O my heart, and bravely beat, Remember not how lovely was delight, How piteous is pain, Keep, keep thy passionate flight, Nor find thy voyage vain, Yea, till thou break, my heart, all meaner quest disdain. EUROPE, MDCCCCI TO NAPOLEON Soars still thy spirit, Child of Fire? Dost hear the camps of Europe hum? On eagle wings dost hover nigher At the far rolling of the drum? To see the harvest thou hast sown Smilest thou now, Napoleon? Long had the world in blinded mirth Or suffering patience dreamed content, When lo! like thunder over earth Thy challenge pealed, the skies were rent: Thy terrible youth rose up alone Against the old world on its throne. With shuddering then the peoples gazed, And such a stupor bound them dumb As those fierce Colchian ranks amazed Who saw the youthful Jason come, And challenging the War God's name Step forth, his fiery yoke to tame. He took those dread bulls by the horn, Harnessed their fury to his will, And in the furrow swiftly torn The dragon's teeth abroad did spill: When lo! behind his trampling heel The furrow flowered into steel! A spear, a plume, a warrior sprung— Arm'd gods in wrath by hundreds; he Faced all, and full amidst them flung His magic helmet: instantly Their swords upon themselves they drew, And shouting each the other slew. But no Medean spell was thine, Napoleon, nor anointed charm; Thy will was as a fate divine To wavering men who watched thine arm Drive on through Europe old thy plough. The harvest ripens even now! Time's purple flauntings, king and crown, Old custom's tall and idle weeds, Were tossed aside and trampled down, While thou didst scatter fiery seeds, That in the gendering lap of earth Prepared a new world's Titan birth. Then in thy path from underground, Where long benumbed in trance they froze, The Nations, giant forms unbound, Slow to their aching stature rose; And through their wintry veins again Slow flushed the streams of life in pain. Thy thunder, O Napoleon, passed, But these whom thou hadst stirred to life, On them the imperious doom was cast Of inextinguishable strife. For peace they longed, but blood and tears Still blinded the tempestuous years. A hundred years have flown, and still For peace they pine; peace tarries yet. These groaning armies Europe fill, And war's red planet hath not set. O mockery of peace, that gnaws Their hearts for so abhorred a cause! Is peace so easy? Nay, the names That are most dear and most divine To men, are like the heavenly flames That farthest from possession shine. Peace, love, truth, freedom, unto these The way is through the storming seas. Ye wakened nations, now no more You battle for a monarch's whim; The cause is now in your heart's core, Your soul must strive through every limb; They who with all their soul contend Bear more, but to a nobler end. Be patient in your strife! And thou, O England, dearer than the rest; England, with proud looks on thy brow, England, with trouble at thy breast, Seek on in patient fortitude Strong peace, most worthy to be wooed. Take up thy task, O nobly born! With both hands grasp thy destiny. Easy is ignorance, easy scorn, And fluent pride, unworthy thee. Grand rolls the planet of thy fate: Be thy just passions also great! Turn from the sweet lure of content, Rise up among the beds of ease; Be all thy will as a bow bent, Thy sure on-coming like thy seas. Purge clear within thy deep desires To be our burning altar-fires! Then welcome peril, so it bring Thy true soul leaping into light; A glory for our mouths to sing And for our deeds to match in might, Till thou at last our hope enthrone, And make indeed thy peace our own. UMBRIA Deep Italian day with a wide-washed splendour fills Umbria green with valleys, blue with a hundred hills. Dim in the south Soracte, a far rock faint as a cloud Rumours Rome, that of old spoke over earth, “Thou art mine!” Mountain shouldering mountain circles us forest-browed Heaped upon each horizon in fair uneven line; And white as on builded altars tipped with a vestal flame City on city afar from the thrones of the mountains shine, Kindling, for us that name them, many a memoried fame, Out of the murmuring ages, flushing the heart like wine. Pilgrim-desired Assisi is there; Spoleto proud With Rome's imperial arches, with hanging woods divine: Monte Falco hovers above the hazy vale Of sweet Clitumnus loitering under poplars pale; O'er Foligno, Trevi clings upon Apennine. And over this Umbrian earth—from where with bright snow spread Towers abrupt Leonessa, huge, like a dragon's chine, To western Ammiata's mist-apparelled head, Ammiata, that sailors watch on wide Tyrrhenian waves,— Lie in the jealous gloom of cold and secret shrine Or Gorgon-sculptured chamber hewn in old rock caves, Hiding their dreams from the light, the austere Etruscan dead. O lone forests of oak and little cyclamens red Flowering under shadowy silent boughs benign! Streams that wander beneath us over a pebbly bed! Hedges of dewy hawthorn and wild woodbine! Now as the eastern ranges flush and the high air chills Blurring meadowy vale, blackening heaths of pine, Now as in distant Todi, loftily-towered—a sign To wearying travellers—lights o'er hollow Tiber gleam, Now our voices are stilled and our eyes are given to a dream, As night, upbringing o'er us the ancient stars anew, Stars that triumphing Cæsar and tender Francis knew, With fancied voices mild, august, immortal, fills Umbria dim with valleys, dark with a hundred hills. S. FRANCESCO DEL DESERTO Peace in smooth summer hour Paces the seas awhile; But Peace has built her tower Upon this chosen isle. Scarcely a ripple stirs In this lone shore's recess, Scarcely a motion blurs The mirrored cypresses Ranked on a crumbling wall, O'er slopes of flowery grass; Where their long shadows fall, Butterflies gleam and pass. The idle sunshine sleeps Before a porch; within, Cool the white cloister keeps Peace that has always been. Beyond, a tangled plot Of garden and tall trees, Soothing its fragrance hot In freshness from the seas. There young monks slowly pace With seldom-lifted eyes, With world-unwritten face, Not mournful yet nor wise. Have they in this fair fold Lost the fierce world in truth? Or must the storms of old Still shake the heart of youth? Far in blue northern haze The vast Alps glimmer pale, Faint through the slumbrous blaze Comes the white sea-gull's wail. A DREAM Behold an endless evening over land That lapped in vast vales rises up afar Into the frozen mountains; evening brimmed With silence, so miraculously clear That crevices in peaks of distant stone And rust-red boughs of cedars, at the foot Of those remote and voiceless waterfalls, Which down the black steeps of lone gorges plunge, Are shaped distinct unto the wondering eye; And the mind, seeing, notes not how 'tis fair, But throned in languor has already summ'd All the vain journey thither. Not a sound Near by; no motion lifts a single leaf, Nor stirs one cold stalk of the sappy spurge And powdery hemlock, nor 'mid clustered reeds The peeping heads of certain dim blue flowers Mirrored in water idle as themselves. And she that sits upon the bank, whose head Droops toward her shoulder, whose full lips are closed, And whose wide eyes seem vacant, yet contain Profound remembrance sunken like a wreck Beneath gray seas, is she of this entranced And glimmering land the sole inhabitant? WORDS Words, breathing words, full-murmuring syllables! How you enrich the thoughts that dwell in you With far-brought perfume, that no meaning tells Yet stirs the mind to flower in thoughts anew! Sometimes how lulling like the rain's soft veil, Then vivid as the pressure of a hand, Now filled with fair surmises like a sail. Before the blue coast of some foreign land. O words, you live and therefore you can die, Ill-yoked, imprisoned, tamed in a dull task! So callous tongues may use you, but not I, Who for your grace, a wooing lover, ask. Dead things may kill; and you being dead entomb The frozen thought that once you clothed in bloom. A PRAYER TO TIME Move onward, Time, and bring us sooner free From this self-clouding turmoil where we ply On others' errands driven continually: O lead us to our own souls, ere we die! We toil for that we love not; thou concealest Our true loves from us; all we thirst to attain Thou darkly holdest, and alone revealest A mirror that our sighs for ever stain. Art thou so jealous of our full delight? Thou takest our strength, toil, fervour, and sweet youth; And when thou hast taken these, thou givest sight At last to see and to endure the truth. Thou art too swift to our weak steps; but oh, To our desire thou movest, Time, how slow! BOOK III (1903–1913) THE OFFERING O love, in whose heart-murmured name Is charm against life's endless wrong, Since all the untuned world became In you a song! I bring not only all I wrought Into the faltering words of speech, I dedicate the song I sought Yet could not reach, Nay, all that passionately fired My heart with hope for ever new Of unattained, but deep-desired Beauty, to you. SIRMIONE Give me your hand, Beloved! I cannot see; So close from shadowy-branching tree to tree Dark leaves hang over us. How vast and still Night sleeps! and yet a murmur, a low thrill, Sighed out of mystery, steals slowly near, Solitary as longing or as fear, Through the faint foliage, stirring it, and shy Amid the stillness, ere it tremble by, Touches us on the cheek and on the brow Light as a dew-dript finger! Listen now, 'Tis not alone the hushings of the bough, But on the slabbed rock-beaches far beneath Listen, the liquid breath Of the vast lake that rustles up all round Whispering for ever! Soon shall we be where The trees end, and the promontory bare Breathes all that wide and water-wandering air Which shall our foreheads and our lips delight, Blown darkly through the breadth and depth and height Of soft, immense, and solitary Night. Where is the Day, Bright as a dream, that on this same cliff-way Fretted light shadows on old olive stems By whose gray, riven roots like scarlet gems The little poppies burned? Where those clear hues Of water, melted to diviner blues In the deep distance of each radiant bay, But close beneath us, past the narrowed edge Of shadow from sheer crag and jutting ledge, Shallowing upon the low reef into gold, A ripple of keen light for ever rolled Up to the frail reed sighing on the shore? Where are those mountains far-enthroned and hoar Above the glittering water's slumbrous heat, With old blanched towns sprinkled about their feet, Lifting majestic shoulders, that each side Of that steep misty northern chasm divide, Where, ambushed in the dim gulf ere they leap, Wild spirits of the Wind and Thunder sleep? 'Tis flown, that many-coloured dream is flown, And with the heart of Night we are alone. This is the verge. The promontory ends. Now the dim branches cover us no more. Abrupt the path descends: But here will we sit, high above the shore, Here, where we know what wild flowered bushes cloak Old ruined walls, and crumbling arches choke With mounded earth, though buried from our eyes In dark now, as beneath dark centuries The marble-towered magnificence of Rome, From whose hot dust the passionate poet fled Hither, and laid his head Where these same waters laughed him welcome home! It is all dark; but how the air breathes free! Beloved, lean to me! Feel how the stillness like a bath desired With happy pressure heals our senses tired; And drink the keen sweet fragrance from the grass And wafts from hidden flowers that come and pass,— None here but we, and we have left behind The world, and cares confined, All with the daylight drowned In darkness on this height of utmost ground, Where under us the sighing waters cease And over us are only stars and peace. O Love, Love, Love, look up! Let your head lean Back on my shoulder. Ah, I feel the keen Indrawing of your breath, and your heart beat Under my own, and sighing through you sweet The wonder of the Night that widely broods Over us with her glittering multitudes. Oh, in Night's garden has a fountain sprung That over old earth showers forever young A fairy splendour of still-dropping spray? Or in mad rapture has enamoured May Through the warm dusk mounted like wine, and towered And in far spaces infinitely flowered, Breaking the deep heaven into milky bloom? So beautiful in this most tender gloom Ten thousand thousand stars through height on height Burn over us, how breathless and how bright! Some wild, some fevered, some august and large, Royal and blazing like a hero's targe, Some faint and secret, from abysses brought, Lone as an incommunicable thought— They throng, they reign, they droop, they bloom, they glow Upon our gaze, and as we gaze they grow In patience and in glory, till the mind Is brimmed and to all other being blind; They hang, they fall towards us, spears of fire, Piercing us through with joy and with desire. Ah me, Beloved, comes an alien gust, A sudden cold thought, blowing bitter dust Upon this rapture. They are dead, all dead! 'Tis but the beauty of Medusa's head Gleaming on us in icy masks, that stare From everlasting winter blind and bare; They have no answer for our hearts that yearn, They have no joy in burning, only burn Upon their senseless motion. Ah, no, no! Can you not feel the warm truth overflow? Light to light answers, even as heart to heart, And by their shining we in them have part. Lo, the same light that in the tiniest spark Makes momentary beauty from the dark, The light that blesses warm earth and inweaves A million colours in young flowers and leaves, That our sick thoughts and melancholy eyes Confounds with magical simplicities, Yea, that by dawn's beginning shall unfold Wide glimmering waters, and to glory mould Frore peaks, wild torrents in the vales between. And golden mists on lawns of living green, 'Tis the same light that now above us showers These star-drops, white and fair as falling flowers; And silent rings a cry from star to sun, Through all the worlds, Light, life and love are one! Hush your heart now, Beloved, hush to sink Your thought down, deep as the still mind can think, Then climb as high as boldest thought can climb! Were these dark heavens the unfathomed gulfs of Time, So might we see bright peopling spirits star The memoriless ages, burning far, Splendid or faint, tempestuous or serene, All quick and fiery spirits that have been, From whose immortal ecstasies and pains Drops of red life run sanguine in our veins; Who lived and loved, and prodigally spent Their strength, their prayers, upon one pure intent, In whom no deed was willed, no lonely thought Attempered and to sword-blade keenness brought, But it has helped us, even us, for whom They shine in glory from the ages' gloom. But oh, it is not only these I see: Look up, behold unnumbered hosts to be! What shall we do for them, whose hope endears Futurity's dark wilderness of years? Heroes, that shall adventure and attain What broke our wills in passion and in pain; Sages, to find all that we vainly seek, Poets, to utter all we cannot speak! And they at last shall into strong towers build The stones we bled to gather, the unfulfilled House of our dream; what was but fable sung, Or indignation on a prophet's tongue, Made form and hue of life's own tissue, wrought Into the rich reality of thought. And women, ah, what majesty of fate Is theirs, for whom the little is made great, The tender strong; far-off they also wait The glory of their burden. Love, what deep Of mystery unfolds! Let your heart leap! Lo, at your bosom all the world to come, A child! It waits, it watches, it is dumb, Yet hearkens and desires; the vision grows Before us, and behind us overflows, Mingling, as throng on throng of stars o'erhead, One undivided host, the mighty dead, The mightier unborn! Time is rent away; There is no morrow, no, nor yesterday, Nor here, nor there, nor sleeping nor awaking; But, like full waters into ocean breaking, Lost at this moment in our heart's high beating The boundless tides of either world are meeting; And by the love-cry in my heart that rings, And by the answer in your heart that sings, We feel, at once exulting and afraid, Near to the glowing of the Hand that made And out of earth, with divine fire instinct, Moulded us for each other's need, and linked Our brief breath with the eternal will. That light Shall kindle, in the dulling world's despite, The inmost of our spirits, burning through The shadow of all we suffer, dream and do, As surely as mine eyes, new facultied In vision to the estranging day denied, Still shall behold, when this fair night is fled, All the stars shine round your belovèd head. GLORIOUS HEART Swift and straight as homing dove, Heedless, so its flight be flown, All the full stream of thy love, Love that knows no mortal bounding, Pours, is emptied for its own, Glorious Heart, Great and loyal and abounding! Over stormy waters eager Lifted like a breasting prow, Though the winds and waves beleaguer, To one star thy true course guiding Onward, ever onward, thou Glorious Heart, Steerest, hoping, well confiding. When thy strength within thee faints, When to grief the way is hard, All thy heroes and thy saints, Lo, with strong hands arming for thee, Hold thy tenderness in guard, Glorious Heart, They that bore thy pains before thee. Like a flag that, battle-girt, Keeps its ardent colours high, Knows not either hate or hurt, Nay, nor fear nor thought of turning, Flag for which men leap to die, Glorious Heart, I adore thy beauty burning. THE CRUCIBLE Because thou camest, Love, to break The strong mould of this world in two, And of the senseless fragments take And in thy mighty music make A world more wondrous and more true, Now my soul hath taken wings, Newly bathed in light intense, And purging off the film of sense, Of its native glory sings. And that inward vision, turning Pomps of earth to vapour brief, Sees as in a furnace burning Time, a swiftly shrivelled leaf: Sees the fortressed city fall To a mound of nameless wall, Shrining temple, columned porch, Life-bought gems, and royal gold, Shake like ashes from a torch; Palaces, world-envied thrones, Crumble down to dust as old And idle as Behemoth's bones On a frozen mountain-top. I see the very mountains drop, Wasting with their weight of stones Swifter than a torrent slides, Melted like the crimson cloud Vanishing about their sides When the morn has burst his shroud. Love, Love, because thou didst destroy So much, and madest so much vain, I know what lives and shall remain, I see amid Time's gorgeous wane The dawn and promise of my joy. O lift me thither, lift me higher! I am not save in this desire, Lost and living, fire in fire. THE CLUE Life from sunned peak, witched wood, and flowery dell A hundred ways the eager spirit wooes, To roam, to dream, to conquer, to rebel: Yet in its ear a voice cries ever, Choose! So many ways, yet only one shall find; So many joys, yet only one shall bless; So many creeds, yet to each pilgrim mind One road to the divine forgetfulness. Tongues talk of truth: but truth is only found Where the heart runs to be out-poured utterly, Like streams whose home is in their motion, bound To follow one faith and in that be free. O Love, since I have found one truth so true, Let me lose all, to lose my loss in you. MOTHER AND CHILD By old blanched fibres of gaunt ivy bound, The hollow crag towers under noon's blue height. Ribbed ledges, lizard-haunted crannies white, Cushioned with stone-crop and with moss embrowned, Cool that clear shadow from the outer glare Above a grassy mound, Where she that sits, muses with lips apart And eyes dream-filled beneath the abundant hair And lets the thoughts flower idly from her heart. Thoughts of a mother! For her child amid Light blossoms that a brook's cold ripple fledge, Wind-shaken at the shadow's glowing edge, Plays with a child's intentness; now half-hid, And now those gay curls caught in frolic sun Toss to the breeze unbid. And through the thoughts of her who watches shine With quiverings of felicity that run Through all her being, as through water wine. Her thoughts flow out to the stream's endless tune. Ah, what full sea could all that hope contain? Then apprehensions vivid like a pain Wing after, swift as through this airy noon The swallow skims and flashes past recall But O returns how soon, Back in a heart's beat! So her fears have sped Far as the last loss—homing out of all The deep horizon to that golden head. The Child, amid the blossom, nothing recks. His eyes a flame-winged dragon-fly pursue Over stirred heads of mint and borage blue In warm and humming air; on slender necks Marsh-flowers peep toward him over juicy rush, And the wild parsley flecks With powdery pale bloom stalks his bare feet bruise, And hot herb-odours mingle where they crush Deep in the green growth and the matted ooze. How smoothly clear along his ankle slips The water, gliding to the pebbled cool! He laughs with those young ripples of the pool. Then the wind lifts a long spray's leafy tips, And dashes him with drops of twinkling fire As in the stream it dips, Where over shadows bright with wavering mesh Bramble and thorn and apple-scented brier Their roots and low leaves thirstily refresh. His mother calls. Now over thymy sod The boy comes, yet he lingers; the flowers keep His feet among them, clustering fair and deep. Red crane's-bill shakes its seed; milk-campions nod, By the rough sorrel little pansies hide; Slim spikes of golden-rod Above the honeyed purple clover flame; And, where the sheltered dew has scarcely dried, Cling worts, close-leaved, each with its own wild name. What secret purpose infinitely wrought, Each in its lovely kind and character, These breathing creatures in the light astir, Articulating new an endless thought That still with some last difference must refine The likeness it had sought? Some bloom to mateless glory will unfold, A grace undreamed some airy tendril twine, Some leaf be veined with unimagined gold. Thee, too, Child, with life budding in thy face And quickening thy sweet senses, O thee too, For whom the old earth maketh herself all new, Each hour compels with unreturning pace From the vague twilight being that keeps thee kin To all the unconscious race, Compels thee onward; for thy spirit apart The habitation is prepared within; The separate mind, the solitary heart. It is a prison the slow days shall build, When, disentwining from the world around, Thou shalt at last gaze out of eyes unbound On alien earth, with other purpose filled,— Thou with the burden of identity, Thou separately willed, And feel at last the difference thine own Mid thy companions, saying, “This is I, I, and none other in the world's mind alone.” Even now thine eyes are lifted from the flowers, And the sky fills them: boundless and all pure, Regions afar to thrilling silence lure. Ah, how to charm the fret of future hours Shall to thy mind come as from wells of light And time-forgetting powers, Words large and blue and liquid as the sky; The absolution of the infinite, And sea-like murmur of eternity! Shalt thou not long then, when the dark hours wring Thy heart with pangs of mortal loss and doom, That old unsevered being to resume With its kind ignorance, relinquishing This self that is so exquisitely made For sorrow; time's dull sting To lose, and the sharp anguish, and the wrong; Into life's universal glow to fade, And all thy weakness in that whole make strong? Yet O thou heart so surely doomed to bleed, Thou out of boundless and unshaped desire Compacted essence single and entire, Rejoice! In thee Earth doth herself exceed O tarrier among flowers, of thee the unplumbed Infinities have need; Or how shall all that dumbness speak, and how Those wandering blind energies be summed As in a star? Rejoice that thou art thou! Mighty the powers that desolate and kill, Armies of waste and winter: and alone Thou comest against them in the might of one World-challenging and world-accusing will. Yet mightier thou that canst thy might refrain, The world's want to fulfil, Thy soul disprison from time's mortal hour, To pardon and pity changing that old pain, And in thy heart the eternal Love let flower All faith inhabits in thy Mother's eyes, Yet she already hath all thy pangs foreknown And in thy separation felt her own. Far from her feet follow thy destinies! There is no step she hath not trod before. Her loss she glorifies To spend on thee her all; and to defend The divine hope which in her womb she bore, Those arms of love wide as the earth extend. CHÂTEAU GAILLARD Shattered tower and desolated keep Darken; far below the river shines Under cliffs that round the twilight sweep, Rock-rough headlands on the sky's confines Couch asleep. Silence breathes; the air colours; dewy smell Freshens keener from the grass; a hush Deepens on some distant evening bell. Burning out of heaven the solemn flush Spins a spell: Sharpens every shadowy edge of stone; Notches gaps abrupt; drains pale the light; Blackens gulfs of fosse, where mounds enthrone What were towers. The ruin to soft night Looms alone. Lo, it lives! Now like a terrible thought Seems it. A man's strength, how frail beside Yonder strength! Could hands of flesh have wrought Such a thing? Mere ashes they that cried, They that fought, Where the little poppy spots with red Crumbling bastions; dust of centuries, all Those strong feet that over heaps of dead Leapt, and hands that furious clutched the wall, Breasts that bled. Yet a presence, yet a power is here, In the darkening silence slowly felt, Silence that is naked and is near. Into cloud those battle rages melt; But a fear Strikes from where these pressing stones conspire Toward a purpose past the strength of each, As a man's deeds knit by one desire, As a great verse out of casual speech Forged in fire. Stones no longer, having filled their place! Nay, though tumbled, torn, and cast aside, Touched with glory Time cannot deface: In such wreck, Man, scarred and glorified, Builds his race. Lion-Heart, thou buildest not in vain, Lion-Heart, that in our own blood still Beatest: rent but royal over Seine This the embattled proud child of thy will Shall remain! A HYMN OF LOVE O hush, sweet birds, that linger in lonely song! Hold in your evening fragrance, wet May-bloom! But drooping branches and leaves that greenly throng, Darken and cover me over in tenderer gloom. As a water-lily unclosing on some shy pool, Filled with rain, upon tremulous water lying, With joy afraid to speak, yet fain to be sighing Its riches out, my heart is full, too full. Votaries that have veiled their secret shrine In veils of incense falteringly that rise, And stealing in milky clouds of wavering line Round soaring pillars hang like adoring sighs, They watch the smoke ascending soft as thought, Till wide in the fragrant dimness peace is shed, And out of their perfect vision the world is fled, Because the heart sees pure when the eye sees not. I too will veil my joy that is too divine For my heart to comprehend or tongue to speak. The whole earth is my temple, and Love the shrine That all the hearts of the world worship and seek. But the incense cloud I burn to veil my bliss Is woven of air and waters and living sun, Colour and odour and music and light made one. Come down, O night, and take from me all but this! I dreamed of wonders strange in a strange air; But this my joy, my dream, my wonder, is near As grass to the earth, that clings so close and fair, Nourished by all it nourishes. O most dear, I dreamed of beauty pacing enchanted ground, But you with beauty over my waiting soul, As the blood steals over the cheek at a heart-throb, stole! In the beating of my heart I have known you, I have found. Incredulous world, be far, and tongues profane! For now in my spirit there burns a steadfast faith. No longer I fear you, earth's sad bondage vain, Nor prison walls of Time, nor the gates of Death. For the marvel that was most marvellous is most true; To the music that moves the universe moves my heart, And the song of the starry worlds I sing apart In the night and shadow and stillness, Love, for you. AT EVENING Fly home, my thoughts, that fretting In alien words all day, Have longed for the sun's setting And wished all words away. Fly home to her that knows you, And in her heart repose you. Fly home, my thoughts, and flutter Like doves to gentle hands. You need no lips to utter What her heart well understands. Her heart will open to you: From far, my thoughts, she knew you. Breathe out your breath, like roses, About her loosened hair; Soothe each eyelid that closes With tender murmured prayer; Your happy vigil keeping Over her sacred sleeping. Fly home, my thought's devotion, Fly fast and there abide. A barren senseless ocean Is all the world beside. Your home is only there, where she Shrines all the world's desire for me. THE TUNNEL Sitting with strangers in the hurrying train, We spoke not to each other. Golden May Flooded those warm fields greener from the rain, Then sudden darkness stole it all away. Her face was gone; but on the dark I framed Its features, to my fancy's utmost height, And with love's utmost fondness, never named, Painted the image of my life's delight. But lo! a gleam the window's edge outlined, And beautifully dawning through the gloom, She came back, O how much more than my mind Had pictured, triumphing in breath and bloom! Then I, ashamed, gave thanks with joy; I knew That my best dream was bettered by the true. AN HOUR Together by bright water We sat, my love and I. Light as a skimming swallow The perfect hour went by With words like ripples breaking On full thoughts softly waking; With thoughts so dear and shy That no word dared to follow. Down by that sunny water The spring's sweet voice we heard. The wind, the leaves' young lover, My love's hair gently stirred. An hour ago we parted; I wander heavy-hearted. Heavily, like a wounded bird, The day lags, night draws over. UNDER A FLOWERING TREE Under a flowering Tree I sat with my dearest Love. Night flowered in stars above And the heart was a-flower in me. DREAM-COME-TRUE Within the eyes of Dream-Come-True Shine the old dreams of my youth. Ere they faded, ere they grew Distant, they were born anew In her truth. Within the heart of Dream-Come-True Lies my life, a folded bud. All that is to hope and do, Joy and triumph, toil and rue, Skies of thunder, skies of blue, Pulse in pulses of her blood. O may the fountain leap in flood, The young shoot branch in leafy wood, Blest in promise through and through By the dear thoughts of Dream-Come-True. THE TIE Coloured like Atlantic wave To whose curve the bright air gave Splendour, and the unfathomed blue Mystery of nameless hue; If to others you but shine As a plait of silken twine, In your rich threads live for me Chosen hours of Cicely. Here her fingers have inwrought Fancies of her changing thought, Sometimes smooth as running stream, Sudden now in wayward gleam, Reverie at some instant broken (Look, the pretty gap that's token): Dear to me because you came Not mechanically tame But with impulses anew Quickened, as the colour grew, Out of laughter or surprise Shining from her lifted eyes, Hovering fears without a cause Soothed in some enchanted pause, Or those silences that sing When happy thoughts go wandering. Here her forehead earnest bent O'er her busy hands' intent, And the wavering threads reply With a frolic mutiny. O in you she wrought so much As my fingers thrill to touch. Round my neck, a blue charm, lie Breathing thoughts of Cicely. RICORDI Of a tower, of a tower, white In the warm Italian night, Of a tower that shines and springs I dream, and of our delight. Of doves, of a hundred wings Sweeping in sound that sings Past our faces, and wide Returning in tremulous rings: Of a window on Arno side, Sun-warm when the rain has dried On the roofs, and from far below The clear street-cries are cried: Of a certain court we know, And love's and sorrow's throe In marbles of mighty limb, And the beat of our hearts aglow: Of water whispering dim To a porphyry basin's rim; Of flowers on a windy wall Richly tossing, I dream. And of white towns nestling small Upon Apennine, with a tall Tower in the sunset air Sounding soft vesper-call: And of golden morning bare On Lucca roofs, and fair Blue hills, and scent that shook From blossoming chestnuts, where Red ramparts overlook Hot meadow and leafy nook, And girls with laughing cries Beat clothes in a glittering brook: And of magic-builded skies Upon still lagoons; and wise Padua's pillared street In the charm of a day that dies: Of olive-shade in the heat And a lone, cool, rocky seat On an island beach, and bright Fresh ripples about our feet; Of mountains in vast moon-light, Of rivers' rushing flight, Of gardens of green retreat I dream, and of our delight. VENICE White clouds that rose clouds chase Till the sky laughs round, blue and bare; Sunbeams that quivering waves out-race To sparkle kisses on a marble stair; Indolent water that images Slender-pillared palaces, Or glides in shadow and sun, where, over Walls that leaning crumble red, Milky blossom and fresh leaf hover, Or glitters in endless morning spread, Far and faint for dazzling miles To lonely towers and cypress isles, Where phantom mountains hang on high Along the mist of northern sky: O Love, what idle tale is told That these are glories famed and old? For to-day I know it is all in you, This vision, bathed in magic blue, My sea that girdles me round and round With winding arms in deeps profound, And bears our thoughts like golden sails To be lost where the far verge gleams and pales, My sky that over the mountains brings The stars, and gives us wondrous wings, My dawn that pierces the secret night To the central heart of burning light And thousand-coloured flames and flowers In radiant palaces, domes and towers! A marvel born of sky and sea, 'Tis all in you, that have given it me. FOREST SILENCE Where she reclines In a rock's cup, Smooth, tawny-mossed, Under tall pines, Her eyes look up, Her gaze is lost. Pine-plumes, sea-gray, When air sings through The rust-red stems, Wave slowly, fray The liquid blue To flashing gems. A lizard's haste Rustles dead leaves; A light cone drops; Else this sweet waste No sound receives But stirred tree-tops. A thrill of air From far slow draws Its long caress, Sighed out nowhere; Then noon at pause Drinks silentness. But she; what waft Of perfume brought Her musing stirs? What pure keen draught Of wine-like thought Even now is hers? Her eyes dream dreams; Coiled foot stirs not, Nor idle hand. Spell-drowsed she seems, Hushed in some plot Of faery land. Yet soft, with such Light lingerings felt As when boughs part Again to touch, Spring, meet and melt Within her heart Hope, wish, and prayer, And memory warm From far hours, all Newly aware Of sudden charm And wistful call. Out of lost years Earth's mystery, Strange with its pain, Holy with fears, Touches her, shy As breeze, as rain. And this rich hour With feeling fills Too full to hold Its wealth—a flower That trembling spills Seed-spice of gold. LOVE'S PORTRAIT Out of the day-glare, out of all uproar, Hurrying in ways disquieted, bring me To silence, and earth's ancient peace restore, That with profounder vision I may see. In dew-baptizing dimness let me lose Tired thoughts; dispeople the world-haunted mind, With burning of interior fire refined; Cleanse all my sense: then, Love, mine eyes unclose. Let it be dawn, and such low light increase, As when from darkness pure the hills emerge; And solemn foliage trembles through its peace As with an ecstasy; and round the verge Of solitary coppices cold flowers Freshen upon their clustered stalks; and where Wafts of wild odour sweeten the blue air, Drenched mosses dimly sparkle on old towers. So, for my spirit, let the light be slow And tender as among those dawning trees, That on this vision of my heart may grow The beloved form by delicate degrees, The desired form that Earth was waiting for, Her last completion and felicity, Who through the dewy hush comes, and for me Sings a new meaning into all Time's lore. Just-dinted temples, cheek and brow and hair— Ah, never curve that wind breathed over snow Could match what the divine hand moulded there, Or in her lips, where life's own colours glow, Or in the throat, the sweet well of her speech; Yet all forgotten, when those eyelids raise The beam of eyes that hold me in their gaze Clear with a tenderness no words can reach. Some silken shred, whose fair embroidery throbbed Once on a queen's young breast; a mirror dimmed That has held how much beauty, and all robbed! One bright tress from a head that poets hymned; A rent flag that warm blood was spent for: sighs, Faith, love, have made these fragrant, and sweet pain Quickens its pangs upon our pulse again, Charmed at a touch out of old histories. But thou, whence com'st thou, bringing in thy face More than all these are charged with? Not faint myrrh Of embalmed bliss, dead passion's written trace, Half-faded; but triumphant and astir Life tinges the cheek's change and the lips' red. Thy deep compassions, thy long hopes and fears, Thy joys, thine indignations, and thy tears, To enrich these, what stormy hearts have bled! For thine unknown sake, how has life's dear breath Been cherished past despair: how, lifted fierce In exultation, has love smiled at death, For one hope hazarding the universe! What wisdom has been spelled from sorrow's book, What anguish in the patient will immured, What bliss made perfect, what delight abjured, That in these eyes thine eyes at last might look! O mystery! out of ravin, strife, and wrong, Thou comest, Time's last sweetness in the flower, Life's hope and want, my never-ended song! Futurity is folded in this hour With all fruition; joy, and loss and smart; And death, and birth; the wooed, the feared, the unknown; And there our lives, mid earth's vast undertone, Are beatings of one deep and mighty heart. LOVE OF MY LOVE O Love of my Love, O blue, Blue sky that over me bends! The height and the light are you, And I the lark that ascends, Trembling ascends and soars, A heart that pants, a throat That throbs, a song that pours The heart out as it sings. Lo, the dumb world falls remote, But higher, brighter, the golden height! Oh, I faint upon my wings! Lift me, Love, beyond their flight, Lift me, lose me in the light. LITTLE HANDS Soft little hands that stray and clutch, Like fern-fronds curl and uncurl bold, While baby faces lie in such Close sleep as flowers at night that fold, What is it you would clasp and hold, Wandering outstretched with wilful touch? O fingers small of shell-tipped rose, How should you know you hold so much? Two full hearts beating you enclose, Hopes, fears, prayers, longings, joys and woes— All yours to hold, O little hands! More, more than wisdom understands And love, love only knows. BAB-LOCK-HYTHE In the time of wild roses As up Thames we travelled Where 'mid water-weeds ravelled The lily uncloses, To his old shores the river A new song was singing, And young shoots were springing On old roots for ever. Dog-daisies were dancing, And flags flamed in cluster, On the dark stream a lustre Now blurred and now glancing. A tall reed down-weighing, The sedge-warbler fluttered; One sweet note he uttered, Then left it soft-swaying. By the bank's sandy hollow My dipt oars went beating, And past our bows fleeting Blue-backed shone the swallow. High woods, heron-haunted, Rose, changed, as we rounded Old hills greenly mounded, To meadows enchanted; A dream ever moulded Afresh for our wonder, Still opening asunder For the stream many-folded; Till sunset was rimming The West with pale flushes; Behind the black rushes The last light was dimming; And the lonely stream, hiding Shy birds, grew more lonely, And with us was only The noise of our gliding. In cloud of gray weather The evening o'erdarkened. In the stillness we hearkened; Our hearts sang together. A DAY THAT IS BOUNDLESS AS YOUTH A day that is boundless as youth And gay with delight to be born, Where the waves flash and glide over sands In their pure image rippled and worn; Where laughter is young on the air As the race of young feet patters light! Linked shadows run dancing before In the midst of the infinite light! On a violet horizon asleep One milky sail glimmers afar; And our spirits are free of the world With nothing to bind or to bar; With no thought but the thoughts of a child; O golden the day and the hour! The strong sea is charmed from his rage, And the waste is more fair than a flower. A WINTER SONG Now December darkens Over Autumn dead. The frozen earth now hearkens For the last leaf to be shed. Above gray grass the branches bare Melt, faint ghosts, in misty air, Like despair. O the nearer, deeper In my heart, remembering My Love's kiss and how her eyes Blessed me like enchanted skies, Is the joy that with the spring Shall waken Earth the sleeper. A SPRING SONG Not yet a bough to bud may dare On the naked tree. Yet happy leaves in the bough prepare, And could I see Far as a soaring bird, I know Where young in sheen The willow, swaying soft and slow, Laughs gold and green. O in the winter's waste to build A tower of song! My Love should enter when she willed That tower strong And climb, and see beyond the bare Dark branches' dearth Spring, shaking out her golden hair, Smile up the earth. BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE PLAIN Between the mountains and the plain We leaned upon a rampart old; Beneath, branch-blossoms trembled white; Far-off a dusky fringe of rain Brushed low along a sky of gold, Where earth spread lost in endless light. The mountains in their glory rose, Peak thronging peak; cloud-shadows mapped The purpling brown with milky blue; Removed, austere, shone rarer snows Above dark ridges vapour-wrapped— Afar shone, Love, for me and you. Sky-seeking mountains, boundless plain! Old walls, and April-blossomed trees! Of ever-young, world-ancient power, The height, the space, was your refrain. In us, us too, eternities Made of that moment a white flower. A PICTURE SEEN IN A DREAM I saw the Goddess of the Evening pause Between two mountain pillars. Tall as they Appeared her stature, and her outstretched hands Laid on those luminous cold summits, hung Touching, and lingered. Earth was at her feet. Her head inclined: then the slow weight of hair, In distant hue like a waved pine-forest Upon a mountain, down one shoulder fell. She gazed, and there were stars within her eyes; Not like those lights in heaven which know not what They shine upon; but like far human hopes, That rise beyond the end of thwarting day In deep hearts, wronged with waste and toil, they rose; And while beneath her from the darkening world A vapour and a murmur silently Floated, there came into those gazing eyes, What should have been, were she a mortal, tears. THE CRUSADER Effigy mailed and mighty beneath thy mail That liest asleep with hand upon carved sword-hilt As ready to waken and strong to stand and hail Death, where hosts are shaken and hot life spilt; Here in the pillared peace thy fathers built On English ground, amid guardian trees, though rent This eve with gusts that yellowing boughs dishevel And over this chantry roof make shuddering revel— With lips of stone thou smilest; art thou content? Still burns thy soul for battle as then, when first, Tost upon shipboard, far thine eyes descried The hills of the land of longing? Still dost thirst To leap on the Paynim armies and break their pride, For God smote in thee, God was upon thy side? Still flame the spears through dust and blood and roar? Still ridest slaying, filled with holy rages, Glorying even now to hear through Time's lost ages Thy deeds yet thundering like sea-surf on shore? Or dost thou rather, a soul made great and mild, Behold it all as a clashing of swords by night Warring to save but an empty grave exiled,— Not there, not thus, to reach the abiding Light. The City of God shines always fair and white, By alien hosts impossible to be won; For how should the pure be pure if these could soil it, Or the holy holy, and ravage of this world spoil it? A thousand storms pass from us, but not the sun. Thou smilest mute: but I in the gloom that hearken To loud wild gusts that, rioting blindly, tear Soft leaves and scatter them over fields that darken, I feel in my heart the wound of Earth's despair. So torn from youth is trampled the innocent prayer; So loveliest things find soonest enemies; so Desire that kindled the shaping mind to fashion Our hope afresh, pours infinite out its passion, And the world it has striven for breaks it with blow on blow. The fool, in his multitude mighty, exults to maim Greatness; heroes under the world's slow wheel Fall; the timorous how they seek to tame Tongues that fear not, hearts that burn and feel! Slaves conspire to enslave; and, last appeal, The deaf have power, the bind authority; yea, They blind the seer, lest they too see his vision, And all their works be turned to a God's derision; Beholding this, who would cry not, Up and slay! O yet my faith is fixt, that the best is chosen, And truth by joy is kissed as certain good, And love, even love, though a million hearts be frozen, Love, weak, and shamed, and tortured, is understood. Yea, powers are with us when we are most withstood. Not vainly the soul in beauty and hope confides; And if it were not so, then had thought no haven, Nor the brave heart wisdom nor warrant above the craven: Mid all these woes the City of God abides. But O to win there, far, how far, it seems! And often, as thou, O pilgrim knight, I long For a land remote, and to be where perfect dreams Of the soul are acts as natural as a song In a singer's mouth, and joy need fear no wrong. And, tossing upon my restless thoughts, I vow My heart away from a world that would undo me. Then lo, in a hush some voice divine thrills through me, “O heart of little faith, seek here, seek now!” Yes, here and now! But how to attain, when fierce In power and pain Time and the World oppose? With what shall the soul be weaponed, her way to pierce To her one desire through many embattled foes? Must all in a waste of strife and of hatred close? Shall love unfriended hide, and longing droop, And all our strength be poured in a conflict sterile, For the world's hard conquest youth's dear hope imperil, And the soul to an alien use ignobly stoop? Thou knowest, Crusader; O thy smile knows all. Love takes no sword to battle, for Love is flame, Itself a sword, upon whose edge falsehoods fall; A peace that troubles, a joy that puts to shame. Though the soul be at war for ever, she burns to an aim, The world has none! We are wronged, but endure; we bleed, But conquer; hatred is idle as vain compliance: We know not Time, who have made the great affiance. To die for that we live for is life indeed. I WANT A THOUSAND THINGS I want a thousand things to-night; The bonds of earth are strict and strong; Yet glory were a vain delight Did you not sing within my song. Hungers, despairs, and victories, All the world's glories and alarms, Forget their wound and find their prize But on your lips, but in your arms. SECRET PEACE O my peace, O well So deep no thought could sound it, Whence arose thy spell When in my heart I found it? Like a coral isle That long silent grew From deepest deeps, the while Slept or stormed the blue, Emerging to enfold Peace answering the skies, And ringed with rock, where rolled All day the white surge cries, Till from isles unknown Far on spicy air Seeds in secret blown Sprang to beauty there. O my love, my sky, That with soft breath broughtest Bloom that cannot die, Of my life thou wroughtest Such an isle that rings A peace within so dear, Howe'er the strong world flings, Without, his surges drear, To my heart, whose core Thy love in joy entrances, Like music the world's baffled roar Only this peace enhances. THE ANNIVERSARY In misty blue the lark is heard Above the silent homes of men; The bright-eyed thrush, the little wren, The yellow-billed sweet-voiced blackbird Mid sallow blossoms blond as curd Or silver oak boughs, carolling With happy throat from tree to tree, Sing into light this morn of spring That sang my dear love home to me. Be starry, buds of clustered white, Around the dark waves of her hair! The young fresh glory you prepare Is like my ever-fresh delight When she comes shining on my sight With meeting eyes, with such a cheek As colours fair like flushing tips Of shoots, and music ere she speak Lies in the wonder of her lips. Airs of the morning, breathe about Keen faint scents of the wild wood-side From thickets where primroses hide Mid the brown leaves of winter's rout. Chestnut and willow, beacon out For joy of her, from far and nigh, Your English green on English hills: Above her head, song-quivering sky, And at her feet, the daffodils. Because she breathed, the world was more, And breath a finer soul to use, And life held lovelier hopes to choose: But O to-day my heart brims o'er, Earth glows as from a kindled core, Like shadows of diviner things Are hill and cloud and flower and tree— A splendour that is hers and spring's,— The day my love came home to me. HIDE ME IN YOUR HEART Hide me in your heart, Love, None but we can know How with every heart-beat Love could grow and grow Till the seed that branched abroad, How, we could not guess, Holds us in the shadow Of its boughs that bless; And the stars and mountains, Earth and chanting sea Seem a mighty music Sung to you and me; Time-forgotten meaning, Poured for us apart, Murmured out of all the world To our secret heart. Hide within my heart, Love. Never may I know My heart's beat from your heart's beat, No, nor throe from throe! DAY'S END When I am weary, thronged with the cares of the vain day That tease as harsh winds tease the unresting autumn boughs, I still my mind at evening and put all else away But the image of my Love, where all my hopes I house. The thoughts of her fall gently as the gentleness of snow. That after storm makes smoothness in the ways that are rough; White with a hush of beauty over my heart they grow To the peace of which my heart can never hold enough. WILD PEACE Blue noon shines o'er the sea; Waves break starry on the sand; Lights and sounds and scents come free On the radiant air of the land. I am filled with the melody of waves That take my heart onward in tune; My heart follows yearning after, and craves No other delight nor boon. They enfold the earth in desire With a closer and closer kiss; From life into life they expire, In dying their birth and their bliss. I am melted in them, I am filled With the passion in peace they have found. Even so would my spirit in peace be thrilled, So be lost in a love without bound. Peace is no tame dove To be caught and caged in the breast, No, nor untamable Love In a moment lightly possest. Peace is wide and wild, And Love without master as the sea; He is soft in his ways as a little child, Yet is mightier far than we. PARTING AND MEETING When we are parted, the world ails, Life wants, the pulse of it falls slack; The wind stings, and the clouds roll black; Wishes fly far as absent sails; And in the mind old mournful tales Murmur, and toss an echo back. In all things fair is found some lack. Light cares grow heavy, and pleasure stales. But when from far in the thronged street Our eyes each other leap to find, O when at last our arms enwind, And on our lips our longings meet, The world glows new with each heart-beat, Love is come home, Life is enshrined. LIBERATION Deep in these thoughts, more tender than a sky Whose light ebbs far as in futurity, Deep, deeper yet my blessed spirit steep, Singing of you still; you and only you Gave me to breathe and touch and taste, all true, Love from the utmost height and deepest deep In my own heart, as all that summer knows Of glory and perfume hides in one shut rose. You and you only gave me, Dearest, this, A pressure of the hand, a silent kiss, And all is well; the hurt, the pain-pricks healed; And rapt and hushed, as from some green recess Into a golden solitariness, All ours, we look; and suddenly revealed Is all that we in our desire might be, Winged and immortal, fretting to be free. Then in that large, appeasing air we grow Near to Love's greatness, and our hearts outflow. We are as those who traffic with the sea; Washed from our liberated spirits is all That the feared world made stagnant, pent or small, For love has touched us with his majesty: We grow beyond the bounds of time and pain, Then in one heart-beat wondering meet again. FLOWER AND VOICE Tremulous out of that long darkness, how Wast thou, O blossom, made Upon the wintry bough? What drew thee to appear, Like a thought in the mind, Ignorant, unafraid, And perfect?—Yet the wind Blew on thee how sharp! how drear The drops fell from the sudden-clouded spring! Those delicate rare petals, all storm-thrilled, Shone into recollection, when my ear From a half-opened door was filled With a voice singing; floating up to sing A song, long ago from a heart's darkness born And upon young lips born again; A voice, flowering clear In beauty stolen from the world of pain. Ah, not to-night of beauty I thought, Yet beautiful beyond all hope's desire, O wonderful, more wonderful to me Than any miracle of beauty wrought Was my Love's voice, saying beside the fire, Where she leaned by my knee, Dear, broken words; words of no art, And yet in them was all my want, I found; Life has no more to give than that sweet sound Breaking and melting deep in my heart's heart. VIOLETS Violets, in what pleasant earth you grew I know not, nor what heavenly moisture stole To tincture in your petals such dim blue As seems a pure June midnight's scented soul: But on her bosom when you breathed so sweet, You were as lovely words to thoughts that rose So deep in us, no language could complete Their sense, nor half their tenderness unclose. Love in such thoughts forever freshly flowers. They neither ask nor answer, only give Their charm up to the kind and unkind hours, Born of that beauty in whose light we live, Whose grace is past all probing of our wit And sweetens even the hand that bruises it. THE DARK GARDEN When your head leans back slowly, and gazing eyes Muse earnest upon mine and starry swim With depths unfathomed that still well and rise, And the words fail, and sight with love grows dim, Whence comes that almost sadness, almost wound Of joy, whose thoughts sink like the wearied flight Of birds on seas, lost in love's deeps profound, Inscrutable as odours blown through night? We know not: and we know not whence love rose Pouring its beauty over us, as the moon On this dim garden rises, and none knows Where she was wandering, those blind nights of June. Hush, hush, the mystery of life is here: Our sacred joy kisses our sacred fear. SOLITUDE The stag that lifted up his kingly head Upon the silent mountains, and from far Beneath him heard the confident harsh cry Of men invading his old solitudes, Then bounding over the rough slopes has climbed By dancing brooks remoter ranges, thick With forests moaning in the cloudy winds Of desolate November, nor has stayed Till on the utmost craggy ledge, among Wet boughs, with antlers dripping from the mist And with sweat-darkened, quivering coat he snuffs Wide-nostrilled the wild air, where motionless He stands at last; what shudder as of joy Deeply to breathe that native loneliness Possesses him! From reddened oaks around Lost leaves are torn innumerably and whirled, Fast as from hearts of men their fearful hopes, Into the drizzling gulf; he hears beyond From cliffs that dimly tower in abrupt Strange precipices, the world-ancient roar Of headlong torrents: now the vapour rolls Blank over all, now rending it a gust Reveals by golden glimpses the pale stream Poured in a trembling pillar, at whose foot The snowy seethe shoots forward and recoils For one tumultuous moment, then again Arches into one pure unfretted wave And sends a voice in splendour down the gorge. A PRAYER O Thou who seekest me Through the day's heartless hurry and uproar, Who followest me to my thought's farthest shore— Nay, who art gone before— Sustain me, O sustain The heart that seeks for thee. The world is filled with rendings and with pain, But thou with peace; with peace though wronged so sore By our despair, blind wrath, and blind disdain. And thou hast made it dear To hope against the wrongs of every hour, And given to hope the power And passion to prevail; The heart, for all its fear, Putting forth delicate, shy flower on flower Against the hard world's hail. O might my love, that in one heart has found Such hope to cherish, and such joy to sound, O might it grow through days that chafe and bound And our true souls from one another screen, Till in its clear profound Part of thy peace were seen. DAWN BY THE SEA Beautiful, cold, freshness of light reveals The black masts, mirrored with their shadowy spars, The hill-gloom and the sleeping wharf, and steals Up magical faint heights of fading stars. I hear the waves, on the long shingle thrown, Slowly draw backward, plunge, and never cease. Against that sea-sound the earth-stillness lone Builds vaster in the early light's increase. O falling blind waves, in my heart you break; Outcast and far from my own self I seem, With alien sense in a strange air awake, The body and projection of a dream. Turn back, pale Dawn, or bring that light to me Which yesterday was lost beyond the sea. WANDERERS O there are wanderers over wave and strand Invisible and secret, everywhere Moving thro' light and night from land to land, Swifter than bird or cloud upon the air. Wild Longings, from divided bosoms rent, Rush home, and Sighs crushed from the pain of years. Far o'er their quarry hover Hates intent; Wing to and fro world-wandering great Fears. Pities like dew, Thoughts on their lonely road Glide, and dark forms of spiritual Desire; Yea, all that from its house of flesh the goad Of terrible Love drives out in mist and fire. Ah, souls of men and women, where is home, That in a want, a prayer, a cry, you roam? MILTON An Ode Soul of England, dost thou sleep, Lulled or dulled, thy mighty youth forgotten? Of the world's wine hast thou drunk too deep? Hast thou sown more than thy hands can reap? Turn again thine ear To that song severe In thine hour of storm and war begotten! Here in towered London's throng, In her streets, with Time's new murmur seething, Milton pacing mused his haughty song; Here he sleeps out feud, fret, and wrong. Nay, that spirit august Tramples death's low dust, Still for us is kindled, burning, breathing. He, on whose earth-darkened sight Rose horizons of the empyrean And the ordered spheres' unhasting flight; He who saw, where round the heart of Light Seraphs ardent-eyed Flamed in circle wide, Quiring music of their solemn pæan, When through space a trouble ran (Like a flush on serene skies arisen) That from this dim spot of earth began— Rumour of the world's new marvel, Man, From whose heart-beat sped Hope, hazard, and dread Past earth's borders to hell's fiery prison: He who saw the Anarch's hate Tower, winged for woe; the serpent charming Eve in her imperilled bower; the Gate Barred, and those two forms that desolate Mid the radiant spheres Wept first human tears; Earlier war in heaven and angels arming: He who, like his Samson, bowed, Toiling, hardly-tasked and night-enfolded, Steered his proud course to one purpose vowed, As an eagle beats through hailing cloud Strong-winged and alone, Seeking skies unknown: He whose verse, majestically moulded, Moves like armed and bannered host Streaming irresistible, or abounding River in a land's remoteness lost, Poured from solitary peaks of frost, And far histories brings Of old realms and kings, With high fates of fallen Man resounding: This is England's voice that rang Over Europe; this the soul unshaken That from darkness a great splendour sang, Beauty mightier for the cost and pang; Of our blood and name Risen, our spirits to claim, To enlarge, to summon, to awaken. A PRELUDE AT EVENING My spirit was like the lonely air Before night, Like hovering cloud that's melted there In the late light, When slow the vast earth-shadows reach To the last flush, And the wandering silences have each Their own hush. Did the green grass about me glimmer, Or trees tower? Not softer to my sense, nor dimmer, The obscure power Of all the world's wide trouble, fought In the heart's recess: My heart was solitude, my thought Emptiness. But through my spirit that seemed, unfilled, Alone to float, A sudden dewy sweetness thrilled; A low note! And then a loud note, rippling full To a still pause: The liquid silence was a pool That a breeze flaws. It throbbed again, how lonely clear! A song that seemed Sprung beyond memory or fear, A voice dreamed In a land that no man ever found; And who knows What shook those lingering drops of sound At the rich close? Ah, where were you, passion and grief Of the world's wrong? What had you to do with a trembling leaf And a bird's song, And spaces calm with coming of night, And the fresh gloom Of shadowy trees, and smelt delight Of hidden bloom? Yet O, in me that song had part Because of you! It drank of the very blood of the heart It quivered through Because of the tears of joy, and the cost Of a joy's breath, Measureless thoughts of a dearness lost, Hope, and death. Strangeness of longing, beauty, pain! I was aware Of all your secret, soft as rain, In the dim air. For Life it was that sang aloud To the lone dew, Brave in the night and sweet in the cloud: My heart knew. MALHAM COVE I There is threat in the wind, and a murmur of water that swells Swift in the hollow: about me a shadow is thrown; For above is no valley sequestered in shy, green dells, But abrupt, sky-closing, a wall and a vastness of stone. Did the rock split asunder with ages? or suddenly smote The hand of a God on the mountain? for under the face Of the imminent height, at the humid and cold rock-base, From out of the dungeoned recesses, the cavernous throat, Disimprisoned there bursts, not a rill, not a trickle of spray, But broad in its gushing and full and sweeping apace A river arisen that dances in laughter away. II Builded aloof; unscaleable; towering stark To the fugitive cloud and the blue, O Soul of the Rock! Silent, remote as the moon, that will'st not to hark To the cry of the lamb on the precipice lost from the flock; If thou suffer the pine in thy cranny that dizzily clings Small-seen as a fern, or a thicket of obstinate thorn, 'Tis disdain that neglects them, O rather a scorning of scorn, Unheedful of them as of those irresistible springs Gushing out from beneath thee, unheard as the cry of the bird That skims from the shadow and hovers a flashing of wings Mid the flush and the greening of April,— thou standest unstirred III As a desert uplifted, a desert where bones rot and bleach, As a barrenness knowing not change nor date nor event, As a strength without speech, without motion, yet stronger than speech; A bulk without feature, a winter of force long spent; And neither is hope, nor terror, nor weakness there, But a pressure and weight of oblivion where no man is known, Nor feature from feature distinguished but all overthrown; Like the rampart of Time that confronts us enormous and bare, Immuring the dream and the vision whereby we have breath; Like Night and the end of the light to them that despair: I stand in thy shadow and fear thee, thou greatness of Death! IV Come away, come away! There is light in the water that glides; Come away with the water that hastes from the heart of the hills, A sinuous ripple that sings and that nowhere abides, But broken, a murmuring sparkle, on ledges and sills Of the rock, as it swerves, carries in it a wavering fire, Like a thought, like a joy, that no barrier stays from its flight, Or a dance of young children that carol their heart of delight; For it calls to the bud to burst open, the blade to thrust higher; To my heart, to my heart, it is calling “O follow! for here Is thine own spirit, quick and enamoured of love and of light; O follow my swiftness and stay not in shadows of fear!” V On beds in the valley, on sunny half-islanded banks, Where roots are athirst and refreshed and saplings grow bold Bowing their youth to the breezes in quivering ranks, Primroses, a cluster of softness and fragrance, unfold; And the fairy anemone, shaking her blossoms agleam— They are kisses of light as they tremble to touch and to part— Is flushed, ah! how faint, as with fire from the innermost heart Of a world in whose veins is a laughter as clear as the stream: And the music upholds me, enchants me, and borne like a wave, I am melted, I flow, I am nought but a hope and a dream, And in me is the youth of the flowers, and grief in her grave. VI Sudden a gust flings a shadow! and shivering, the black Driven leaves at the roots of the oak-tree are whirled up and lost Like the wild thoughts of fear into darkness, and strong boughs crack, And a gloom rushes down with a wailing, and out of it tossed Pale snow is outshaken, and hail drops icily keen On young leaf and dead; and awakened in tree-tops aloud Is the roar of the storm that has gathered the hills in a shroud Until naught of the towering rock but in glimmers is seen, A vision unfeatured, a phantom of terrible birth:— Is it thou that appearest, a presence divined in the cloud, Thy ribs and thy knees and thy breasts, O Titaness Earth? VII Is it thine, the great voice that confuses the winds and the floods In a meaningless cry as of madmen, a blindness of wrath, Smiting the bosses of oak and the virginal buds, Negligent where thou hast beaten thy desolate swath? O thou, who hast armed as for battle thy creatures wild With fierceness of claw and of fang, of hoof and of horn, From thee, even thee, from thy heart-beat was man, too, born With flesh like a flower defenceless? is he thy child? In whose eyes are wonder and trouble, who strikes, yet the wrong He has done he turns from again and with sorrow is torn: How shall his heart be as thine or in thy way strong? VIII For who that is born of a woman has known not the hour When the spirit within him is daunted and this world comes As an army against him, a terror of alien power, And fate, too vast to be borne, his courage benumbs? Lost he seems as a child upon mountains alone. Who has longed not then with longing for a strength past pain To endure the rending of sorrow that makes hope vain, To be kneaded in iron and stubborned in armour of stone? That hour when the heavens are shaken within the mind, And the world is an enemy armed, have I not known? For the strength of the stony mountain have I not pined? IX But lo! on a sudden, with sighing the storm ends now In a radiant relenting: golden the light reappears With a glory of drops that are dancing on leaf and on bough; And a music, a wandering music returns to my ears. From the primrose is breathing a freshness, and wild, shy smells From the moss, where the snowflake is melted to dazzling dew, And the voice of the birds on the banks is uplifted anew To the carolling voice of the river that onward swells. Onward away, where the buds gleam white on the tree! The rain and the gloom are forgotten in heaven's young blue; And my heart flows out with the river, the river with me. X In a trance, in a trance I listen; and into my soul, As it draws far back to a stillness darkly stored With infinite sound gather and gradual roll The voices of all the torrents on earth outpoured. “We tarry not, rest not, sleep not,” aloud they cry, “We are swift as the hours that crumble thy strength into dust; We build thee no home, nor a fortress wherein to trust; But in us is the sound of dominion falling from high, And the kings of the world dethroned and towers laid bare. We move, we are ever beyond; we change, we die; We laugh, we live; to follow wilt thou, too, dare?” XI How shall I not go with you, O waters swift? Too long in yesterday's self I tarry, and keep The dust of the world about me. Uplift, uplift, Lose me, a wave in the waves that laugh and leap! Lo, into uttermost time my thoughts I send: And because in my heart is a flowing no hour can bind, Because through the wrongs of the world looking forth and behind, I find for my thought not a close, for my soul not an end, With you will I follow, nor crave the strength of the strong Nor a fortress of time to enshield me from storms that rend. This is life, this is home, to be poured as a stream, as a song. ELEGY The little waves fall in the wintry light On idle sands along the bitter shore. The piling clouds are all a pale suspended flight; They tarry and are moved no more. Thin rushes tremble about the naked dune; A hovering sail sinks down the utmost sea; With wreckage and old foam the unending sands are strewn; And the waves heap their dumbness over me. This is the earth that lasts beyond our dreams Of time, and rushing onward without rest, Deludes us with her trancing silences, yet teems Fiercely, and burns within her breast, Insatiate of youth, this old, old Earth, Who uses our spent ashes for her need, Shaping the delicate marvel of her youngest birth, And still she kindles a new seed, Intent on the unborn creature of her thought And busy in the waste: O even here, Though masked as in a calm of dumb frustration, naught Stays her, no pang nor any fear, But subtly, with a touch invisible, She is changing and compelling; and me too, Me too, upon the secret stream of that deep will She moves to a destiny ever new. And yet this hour my spirit hides its face, And, backward turned, sighs out an idle pain For the remembered paths these feet may not retrace And the hours that cannot come again. O hours of heavenly madness in delight That felt the swiftness and the throb of wings, That stole the burning soul of naked summer night And the moons of the perfumed springs, Not now to you my longing stretches hands, But to lost hours, that had no fruit, no seed. Like fading of low light beyond forgotten lands, They have passed and are dead indeed. And once, for once, unrecking Earth, you seem With me to linger and to acquiesce, To share the desolation of my doubt and dream, And to ponder upon barrenness. The wind lulls on the waste, and has no will. The foiled tides hush and falter at their bound, A little sand is blown, then all again is still; And the clouds hang their silence around, With such an absence felt in the lone skies, Suppression of such tears, profoundly sprung In long-remembering looks of unconversing eyes, As when the old bury the young. THE MIRROR I Where is all the beauty that hath been? Where the bloom? Dust on boundless wind? Grass dropt into fire? Shall Earth boast at last of all her teeming womb, All that suffered, all that triumphed to inspire Life in perfect mould and speech, the proud mind's lamp serene— Nothing? Space be starry in tremendous choir— For whom? In this deserted chamber, as the evening falls, Silent curtains move no fold; Long has ebbed the floor's pale gold; Shadows deepen down the silent walls. The air is mute as dreams beneath a sleeper's face, Distant, undivined; But every hovering shadow seems to hold Want untold. The look of things forsaken, each in its own place, Memories without home in any mind, Idle, rich neglect and perfume old— Over these the glimmer of the twilight fades; Infinite human solitude invades Forms relinquished, hues resigned. O little mirror, round and clear, In solemn-coloured shadow lying Cold as the moon, pale as a tear, With spiritual silver beam replying, Indifferently to all things as to one; Beauty's relic and oblivion, But void, void, void! Desolate as a cave Abandoned even of the breaking wave, A home of youth and mirth, when all its guests are gone! As I touch thee in the silence here, Where thou liest alone, apart, Through the silence of my heart Thou flashest elfin flames of fear. Like a thought of lost delight, Like love-sweetness, like despair, Come faint spices of the night Floating on the darkened air. The air is tender with the sense of dew, Is tranced, is dim, is heavy, as if there hung Within the tinges of its shadowy hue Ghosts of lost flowers, with all their petals young, And the young beauty they made incense to. O forlorn mirror, is there nothing thine? The cup is emptied of its fragrant wine, The dress is vacant of the breathing form, And thou that gleam'st All absence of what once moved gracious, white and warm In thy clear wells, or luminously mused, O little mirror long disused, Laid in this empty bower's recess, Thou thyself seem'st The soul and mystery of emptiness. Yet if I should raise thee now, As once and oft, thou knowest how, Hand and slim wrist, smooth as a flower-stem, raised Thy silent radiance, and with intent brow Eyes within thee gazed Seeking thine oracle, Shall not from these pellucid secrecies appear Not I, nor any shape of this dim room, But all that in thy cave of lambent gloom Hath dwelt and still may dwell, Ambushed like visions bound in sleeping memory's cell; All that thy brightness buries as the sea Tossed bones and crusted gold: had I the key, Might'st thou not open depths, might'st thou not yield, Wonder of wonders! what since time began Was never yet revealed, The unmapped, unmeasured, secret heart of man? Half-shut eyes voluptuously Lightening, as the bosom swells and glows; Smile to smile flowering from an ardent thought: O what moments didst thou deify With the promise of life crushed to wine Redder than the cheek's triumphant rose! —But from deeper places hast thou brought Nothing? Are not other answers thine? Hast thou not heard, hast thou not seen, Hast thou not shown, hast thou not found Shames unwhispered, terrors bound, Earthquake pangs of aghast surmise, When with itself the heart has been Face to face in an hour profound? Out of thee what ghosts shall rise, Shapes and gestures, and accusing eyes! World-flattered faces in midnights of pain; Faces defaced by tiger-lusts insane; Faces appalled before a self unguessed; Ashaming dawns on faces fallen and dispossessed! O what glimpses hast thou flashed in dread, With what hauntings wast thou visited, Apparitions of a soul made bare Shuddering at the thing it looked on there! But thou art stainless, though the heart has bled, Thou art silent as the air Or the wave that closes smooth above the drowner's head. No man hath seen his soul Save for a glimpse in the night Brief as an ember of coal Blown for an instant bright. To see his own soul as it is, Eternity must enter him With the torches of Seraphim That have shone to the last abyss. Mirror, couldst thou show the spirit this, Then within this narrow room Were the Judgment and the Doom. For by so much as its own self it knew, Searched by that burning vision through and through To the innermost of where it crouched and hid Amid the husks of the mean deeds it did, Amid the shadow of all it shunned, the quest It turned from, and in palterings acquiesced, To the uttermost of what its eager passion Caught of the glory springing to re-fashion Hope and the world, and great with pity saw Life darkly wrestling with the angel, Law— By such a measure, molten in that fire, Should the soul mete itself on God's desire, Suffer at last all wisdom, and endure The beam and vision of a thought all-pure. O were not this to taste Heaven's dawn, or dwell, Because of knowledge, in the pains of Hell? II Where is all the wailing, all the want That sorrow tore From Love's bleeding breast? Extinguished quite? Shall the wide-winged glory of hope extravagant, Shall the laughter, shall the song that sprang to soar Fall, and no ear hearken, and their falling flight Echoless waste walls of adamant Ignore? Draw wide the curtain! Fabulous, remote Night is come. Over Earth's lost bosom fragrant breathings float Into glimmering heights of gloom, But upon the solitary verge extreme Steals a beam. Hushed and sudden, ere the eye could note, Lo, the moon is there! Innocence of splendour, gazing bare, Drenches leaves in quiet, thought in dream. Is it Earth's pale mirror lifted lone For an answer to her million sighs? Can that far Tranquillity atone In the gaze of those unnumbered eyes For the pang and for the moan, For the heart's dim burial and long dirge, Luring, as she lures the mutinous sea-surge, To her will of peace this human tide? From a charmed shadow on the shorn hill-side Hand-in-hand lovers through the trees emerge, And pause; their very souls are glorified, Their feet tread airy on immaterial ground, With marvelling gaze they feel That well of spiritual light o'erflow The listening hush, and steal Fear and trouble, as though The world were one vast music of ethereal sound And they a stillness in the midst of it. Peace, peace and pity! pardon, pity, peace, Passing all mortal wit! O truth long-sought and magically found, O wonder and release! O secret of the world long-hidden in day's dust! They bathe their hearts in that sweet dew, their hands Thrill clasping in a touch that understands Nothing magnificent but a divine surrender Absolving and august. To distances immersed and tender Unfolds this vale of struggle hard and pent, Region of unwon ravishment In unadventured lands, A place of leaves and lonely light and leafy scent Storied like that old forest of the perilous Fleece. Sorceress of million nights! Hast thou charmed indeed the brew, When the stealth of perverse rites— Mouths that mutter, hands that strew,— Love tormented and malign, Flushed with terror like a maddening wine, Sought another's rue? Hecate of the cross-roads, hast thou hearkened To the sailing witch's mew And the felon raven's croak When the shuddering winds were darkened And the leaves rushed from the withered oak? Ah, not these foul toys would I invoke! O for some supreme enchanting spell, Voice of a God crying aloud, Felt and feared on Earth's heart-strings, To conjure and to compel Like a spectre from the shroud Or like incense-dust that springs Into fire and fragrant cloud, Out of thy blind caves and cold recesses, Out of that blank mirror's desert beam All the unnumbered longings and wild prayers, Infinite heart-broken tendernesses, Indignations and despairs That from man's long wound of passion stream, Sucked like vapour, like a mist of tears Into that imagined peace, that ecstasy! O surely, surely, thou hast wrought thy part In every secret and tempestuous heart, Thou that hast gleamed on thousand battle-crimsoned spears, Thou that wast radiant on Gethsemane! She has seen not, she has heard not. Hearts have leapt for her, but she has stirred not. Pity she has made, but none has had, Though her magic mingles with Earth's want And the trouble of Earth's tender sons, Thunder of the builded Babylons, Music of the dreaming poet's chant, Venture of the steering argosies, With a light as of divine fulfilment clad Breathing in for ever syllables of peace. Peace, is it peace? Yet Earth, dark Earth, Mother, O Mother, thou that nourishest In the blind patience of thy teeming breast Hope without end; who drivest life to birth, Yet numberest not our dear and sacred dead, Unheeding of our anguish and lost cries So thou mayst build beyond us, in our stead, A race enriched with all for which we bled, Of haughtier stature and of kinglier eyes; Thou of whose vast desire strong realms of old, The dynasty of empires, were but waves That towered and crashed into their splendid graves, For thine unresting hunger to remould Yet mightier, O insatiable! Doth fear Not shake thee, Mother, seest thou not ev'n here In that cold mirror's answer what shall steep Thee also in oblivion? Thou shalt keep Of all the fruit of thy most fiery spring, Stored riches of thy sleepless trafficking, And proud perfection thou hast travailed for, Nothing! The beauty that thy body bore Fresh and exulting (Mother, dost not weep?) Laughter of streams, young flowers, and starry seas, Pillar and palace, heaven-faced images That man has wrought, his tossing heart to ease, Nothing! To cloud shall vanish the deed done; The bannered victory, the wrong borne alone, Nothing! and thou be desolate and none To feel thy desolation: emptiness, Night within night, immense and issueless, Till as a breath upon the mirror dies, Fades the last smoke of thy long sacrifice. Out of the deeps, trembling, the soul Cries through night to the silent pole: “I that am want, I that am grief, I that am love, I that am mirth, I that am fear, I that am fire, Though thou clothe me in beauty brief, Though I have worn thy sweet attire, I, thy endless sorrow, Earth, Dwell in the glory of God's desire, That kneads for ever in the flesh Of man, to make his spirit afresh, A marvel more than all thy wandering seas, And mightier than thy caverned mysteries, Nor stays nor sleeps, but world on world transfuses Melted ever to diviner uses, Through infinite swift changes burning, Itself the end, no end discerning, Till all the universe be wrought Into its far perfecting thought. Then this mind of cloud and rue Shall in eternal mind be new, Mirror of God, pure and alone, See and be seen, know and be known.” TO TIME Time, Time, who choosest All in the end well; Who severely refusest Fames upon trumpets blown Loud for a day, and alone Makest truth to excel: Shadow of God, slowly Gathering words, long Scorned, to make them holy, And deeds like stars bright That none perceived in the light, Lifting the weak to be strong: Shall I not praise thee, Thou just judge? Yet O What so long stays thee? Why must thy feet halt, While our tears grow salt And our old hopes go! Beauty is throned at last; Truth rings falsehood's knell; But our strength, our joy is past While our hearts wait thee: Time, Time, I hate thee, Hate thee, and rebel. THE TIGER-LILY What wouldst thou with me? By what spell My spirit allure, absorb, compel? The last long beam that thou didst drink Is buried now on evening's brink. The garden's leafy alleys lone, With shadowy stem and mossy stone, Intangibly seem now to dress Colour and odour motionless. A stealing darkness breathes around, As if it rose out of the ground, And tingeing into it soft gold Ebbs, and the dewy green glooms cold, And dim boughs into black retire. But thou, seven-throated Flower of Fire, Sombring all the shadows near thee, Dost still, as if the night did fear thee, Glory amid the failing hues And this invading dusk refuse, And breathing out thy languid spice My spirit to thine own entice. Warm wafts that linger touch my cheek. What is it in me thou wouldst seek? Thou meltest all my thoughts away As leaf on leaf is mingled grey In shadow on shadow, past discerning. O cold to touch, to vision burning, What power is in thee so to change And my familiar sense estrange? Thou seemest born within a mind That has no ken of human kind; Remote from quick heart, curious brain, Feeling in joy, thinking in pain, Remote as beauty of sleeping snow Is from a flame's wild shredded glow; Remote from mirth, anger or care, Or the deep wound and want of prayer, Yet like some word of splendid speech Beyond our human hearing's reach, Whose meaning, could its sound be known, Might earth's imprisoned secret own That binds as with a viewless thread This throbbing heart of joy and dread With tremblings of the wayside grass And pillars of the mountain pass And circling of the stars extreme In boundless heights of heaven. I dream My dark heart into earth, I heap My spirit over with cold sleep, Resign my senses, one by one, To glooms that never saw the sun, Fade from this self to what behind Earth's myriad shapes is urging blind, Am emptied of man's name, become A blankness, as the mountain dumb, If so I may attain to win The secret thou art rooted in. Can life renounce not life? Must still The inexorably moving will Seek and make rankle the dulled sting Of essence? Must the desert spring Revive, and the forgotten seed Be drawn again by its old need Through blind beginnings of a sense, And dark desire of difference, And fear, and hope that feeds on fear, To its own destined character? I cannot lose nor abdicate The separateness of my state, Nor thou, that out of burial drawn Through the black earth didst shoot and dawn Tender and small and green, and mount In air, a springing, silent fount, Until the cold bud, sheathed so long, Slow swelled and burst like sudden song Into the sun's delight, and naught Of costliest tissue ever wrought, Fragrant and in rare colours dyed, For the white body of a bride Or king's anointing feast, could so Enrich the noon or inly glow To lose the sweetly-kindled sense In mystery of magnificence. Was there no cost to make thee fair? Did no far-off long pains prepare Those clustered curves of incense-breath? Did nothing suffer unto death To poise thee in thy glory? Came No tinge upon thy coloured flame From sighs? Was there no bosom bled That thou mightest be perfected— As, serving some taskmaster's doom A brown slave patient at the loom Toils, weaving his fine web of gold, More precious than his race, to fold In soft attire an idle queen, When long his own thin hands have been Dust, but in all their toil arrayed She through her pillared palace-shade Glows flower-like, and her young gaze has No thought of any deep Alas! Threaded into the sumptuous vest That lies upon her perfumed breast; Or as at crimsoned eve on high Some dying warrior turns his eye Where, lifted over spear and sword Among the loud victorious horde, A golden trophy gleams with blood That from his own spent body flowed, And trumpets sound across the sand To sunset in a conquered land? O thou wast from life's weltering ore Breathed by enchanting mind before Man was in his own shape. Far, far Thou seemest as the evening star! Yet movest me like that lone light Fetched through the ages of the night Into this breathing garden-close; Or like the things that no man knows In a child's eyes; or like, for one Watching a seaward-sinking sun, Beyond cold wastes of water pale The dim communion of a sail. Ah! though I know not what thou art, Yet in the fastness of my heart How shall I tell what lies unwrought Into the figured films of thought, Uncoloured yet by sharp or sweet, Or what forge of transforming heat Threatens this world of use and fact Wherewith the busy brain is packed? Thou art of me, O Flower of Flame, What is not uttered, has no name, The springing of a want unmated, A joy no fallen hour has dated. Some of my mystery thou holdest, Secretly, splendidly unfoldest. THE BOWL OF WATER She is eight years old. When she laughs, her eyes laugh; Light dances in her eyes; She tosses back her long hair And with a song replies; Then on light feet she darts away Tripping, mischievously gay. But now into this room of shadow Coming slowly with the sun's long ray And all the morning on her simple hair, O how serious-eyed She steps pre-occupied, Holding a bowl of water Poised in her fingers' care,— Water quivering with cool gleams And wavering and a-roll Within the clear glass bowl, That brimmed and luminous seems A wonder and a shining secrecy, As if it were the world's most precious thing, So open-clear that all have passed it by. Cut stalks of iris lie On the bare table, flowers and swelling buds Clasped in close curves up to the purple tips That shall to-morrow burst And shoot a splendid wing, When they have drawn into their veins the spring Which those young hands, with the drops bright on them, So all intently bring; Costless felicity, Living and unbought! And over me, O flowers That neither ask nor sigh, Comes the thought, How all this world is wanting and athirst! FERRY HINKSEY Beyond the ferry water That fast and silent flowed, She turned, she gazed a moment, Then took her onward road Between the winding willows To a city white with spires: It seemed a path of pilgrims To the home of earth's desires. Blue shade of golden branches Spread for her journeying, Till he that lingered lost her Among the leaves of Spring. IN THE FOREST The beeches towering high Greenly cloud the sky. The shadows all are green With living sun unseen. O wonderful the sound Of green leaves all around, When nothing yet is heard Of windy branches stirred But wavering lights alone Innumerably blown Come trembling, and then cease Upon a trembling peace. What breathed in it? A sigh? Or something yet more shy Of speech? A spirit-kiss? A waft of fairy bliss That seeks for voice on our Lips, there to find its flower In some sweet syllable? O Love, I cannot tell; But light brims in your eyes And makes divine replies. THE FOREST PINE A hundred autumns fallen in fire To dust and mould Have faded from their perished gold To throne thee higher, O Titan pine, that soarest straight From ground to sky without a mate, Like one desire. Dark is the hollow as a cup Of shadow immense, Of daylight-daunting dimness, whence Thou springest up Far into light, to take thy fill Of splendour, solitary in still Magnificence. Leaves of the low brake hide a stir Of small soft things: Life, busy in flit of secret wings And slinking fur, Pricks buried seeds that upward thrust, And green through germinating dust Triumphant stings. But thou, that seemest earth to scorn And air to claim, With all thy plumy spire aflame And crest upborne In the blue air, so far, so high, As if the silence of the sky About thee came, Thou hidest all the sappy stream That in thee swells; Motionless fibre nothing tells: And thou dost seem To tower in glorious ignorance Of earth's small stir and chafe, a trance, A soaring dream! And in a trance thou holdest me With bated will; And I am still, as thou art still, My spirit free, My body charm-dissolved to naught But the vibration of a thought, If thought could be. O hush! within the blood is felt An airy fear, A faltering; and the heart can hear The silence melt To something frailer than a sound Borne from the wide horizon's bound To the inward ear. Slowly, ah! slowly, a hush begins, A trembling, where Those branches sleep on golden air, And gradual wins A voice, a music, a long surge, Sweet as a song, sad as a dirge, Sighed out like prayer! The singer knows not what he sings. A lonely sound Comes trembling through him from profound Aerial springs. The songs, the sighs, the world exiled, Seek him and in his heart-throbs wild Still their wild wings. FIDE ET LITERIS (Written for the Fourth Centenary of St. Paul's School) When the long-clouded spirit of Europe drew Life from Greek springs, frost could no longer bind, And old truth shone like fresh dawn on the blind, Our Founder sowed his pregnant seed: he knew No crabbed rule but rather chose a clue That should emband us of our historied kind Comrades, and keep in us a morning mind, Since to the wise Learning is always New. In Faith and Letters he enshrined his light; Faith, the divine adventure that holds on Through this world's forest into worlds unknown, And Letters, that since speech on earth began As one unended sentence burning write The hope, the triumph, and the tears of Man. THE TRAM (In the Midlands) I A grinding swerve, a hissing spurt, And then a droning through the dirt! The tram glides on its wonted way Of everyday, of everyday. Past every corner still the same Squat houses huddle, meanly serried, An image of the mute and maim With life behind their windows buried; Blank windows staring under slate That presses on them desolate As eyes bereft of brows, and drips On puddled, flowerless garden strips. Is it evening, noon or morn? Is it Autumn, is it Spring? Nothing tells but the forlorn Rain that is over everything. A rain that seems too slow to fall And drifts, an immaterial pall Of wetness in the air; it leaves A dismal glistening on the eaves, And grimed upon the pavement lies, For the dirt is in the very skies. Like without, and like within! Dull bodies clatter out and in, And the bell clangs, as they subside On the long seat, and on we glide, Defensive creatures, all askance At one another! Small eyes lance Suspicion; fingers tighten close On baskets; thin lips will not lose A word too much, and skirts draw shy From any touch too neighbourly. And now a bald-head, grossly quaking And lurching round for elbow space, Sets a black-beaded bonnet shaking Above a pinched averted face Or stiffly-bastioned heaving bust That virtuously expands distrust. And all the fluttered narrow looks Appear like little painful books Of soiled accounts, where bargains keep Their cherished tale of capture cheap. For life is all a cheapening, And the rain is over everything, And there is neither mirth nor woe. Who made it so, who made it so? II As I muse, as I muse, Numbed at heart, with eyelids leaden, Stupefying senses lose All but sounds and sights that deaden; Glassy gaze and shuffled feet, Humid glide of the endless street Passing by with rank on rank Of dripping roofs and windows blank, Till one dull motion drones the brain Out of meaning, out of time, And the blood beats to a chime As of bells with mouth inane. And now a monstrous ark it seems That's hurried with the speed of dreams Through streets of ages! On it drives Among unnumbered years and lives. And now the sound grows like a surging, As if this speed a host were urging, And in the sound are voices coming Thick, and tumultuous music drumming; And savage odours are astir Of forest leaves and hidden fur, And naked limbs of hunters glide And warriors in the great sun ride, And mutinous-nostrilled horses champing With restless necks are strongly stamping. The Roman purple passes proud Like an eagle through a cloud. Lo, knights-at-arms with pennons dancing To death's adventure gay advancing, And here a queen that is a bride Crimson-robed and lonely-eyed, And there a pilgrim's dusty feet Faring to the heavenly city; And now an idle beggar singing How the sun and wind are sweet A wayside song, a wanderer's ditty: And still around, out of the ground, The armies of the dead are springing; And with unearthly speed and number Compelled like those that walk in slumber They follow, follow! And at my ear An imp that squats with demon leer Is screaming, See the Triumph go! See for whom the trumpets blow! The prophesied, that goes before us! This is he, Time's crown and wonder That has the very stars for plunder; This is he, the Promethean, (Hark the ever-rolling pæan With a wilderness of apes for chorus!) Who fetched from heaven the stormy fire To serve and toil for his desire, And plumbed the globe, and spoiled old Earth Of all the secrets of her birth; See him, throned triumphant there, Like a toad, with glassy stare; Eyes, and sees not; ears, and hears not! Heart, and hopes not; soul, and fears not! III A boy with a bunch of primroses! He sits uneasy, flushed of cheek, With wandering eyes and does not speak: His hands are hot; the flowers are his. But Spring, O Spring is in the world. And to the woods my fancy flying Sees all the little fronds uncurled, Where still the dead brown bracken's lying And a thousand thousand shining drops Are on the young leaves of the copse. The spurge has all his green cups filled— A gust will shake and brim them over— From trembling oats the rain is spilled; I smell the sweetness of the clover. Long pods of tendrilled vetch are thirsting, White flowers on the thorn are bursting; Twigs redden on the sapling oaks Above the grass that shoots and soaks; The streams flow silent, full and fast; The cuckoo's cry is heard at last; In forky boughs and leafy shade There's busyness for every wing; And sweet through stalk and root and blade Run juices of the wine of Spring. But the primrose perfume, faint and rare Is like a sigh of Spring forsaken. O shy soft beauty, torn and taken! O delicate bruised tissue fair! You are like the eyes of an outcast fond, Or a face seen at a prison-grate: For Beauty's but a vagabond And knows no home and has no mate. Alas! what dungeon walls we rear, For our possession, round us here! We make a castle of defence Out of the dullness of our sense; Possess our burrow like the mole; And with the blundering hands of chance Grow cruel in our ignorance. What is another's springing soul That I should seek to force and bind it? To catch my gain where it has tripped, To thrust it down when it has slipped, To stupefy and dumb and blind it, Fortress my virtue with its failing, And kindle courage at its quailing? What is another's thought, that I Should wish it mine in effigy? Ah! we that grasp and bind and tame, It is ourselves, ourselves we maim; We maim the world. The very Spring Stops all mute and will not sing, The sapless branches will not quicken, The cells of secret honey sicken, Giant brambles writhe and twist About the trees in poisonous mist. The spider fattens; flies oppress, And the buds are blackened promises, Nothing stirs, but the leaf is shed, And all the world of wonder's dead! O for the touch that shall awake! O for the word that shall renew! And all this crust of sense shall break And the world of wonder pierce us through; The scales be fallen from a sight Ravished with fountains of delight, And the sad dullness of our scorn Be like remembered night at morn: Then we shall feel what we have made Of one another, and be afraid. TOWERS OF ITALY Never were towers so fair, so bold, Passionately springing, arrogant towers! Nor air so blue over roofs so old, Nor on ancient walls so rare a gold, When I found my love among the flowers. O mighty Spirits, never to be stilled, Whose glorious works concluded seem, Yet in whom is a glory unfulfilled, And still for us you build, you build, What have you told her out of your dream? She comes from shadow of streets below, And surely, O Spirits, you were there, Pacing among the shadows; lo, In her eyes is a light, on her face a glow, As she comes through a golden air. Do you feel, do you breathe and throb again In her bosom's beat and shining eyes,— As an old chant heavy with world-old pain Is lifted afresh in a splendid strain On young lips, up to the skies? My love is fair as a voice that sings, In a scented garden of joyous flowers. Do the old walls keep their buried things? Yet the air is astir as with throbbing of wings And heaven with the springing of the towers. The hills lift a loneliness around; But my love has a light about her head; And as if they uttered names renowned, Bells from the towers to the silences resound— Voices of the youth of the dead! VIGIL In the hollow of pale night upon the moor The silence blows a perfume: O but hark! A sound is in the bosom of the dark, Breathed like a secret from the glimmering shore; A vigil of unearthly sound, the sea That never slumbers and begins anew, And melts into our hearts amid the dew, Murmuring on the moor to you and me. Out of a silence dateless as the old earth, Before ear heard or ever voice could frame Speech, or the human dearness of a name, To glorify man's longing or his mirth, Ere ever any place was historied For hearts that sever yet their own home keep, That sound comes immemorial like sleep Fresh, with the morning in dark softness hid. O Love, O Love, were we not there, we too, In far nights and wild silences? Were we Not part of this old secret of the sea? For O your kiss, thrilling my body through, Touches me from eternity, as if I And you were of the things before Time came To measure men's desire and loss and shame, And no use disenchants this mystery. THE PORCH OF STARS As in a porch of stars we stand; the night Throbs through us, O Love, with its worlds of light, And mingles us in glory of one breath, One infinite ignorance of Time and Death. Behold, I am dyed in you, and you in me; We are the colours of infinity, We are two flames that are one flame, We are but Love, and have no name. But did we part, O Love, if we could part, The very blood were taken from my heart, Time and Death would ride the night Then, and ended were all light, The stream of stars would fall like stone And heaven's utmost height be darkened, And we be lost, like dust that's blown, Like a cry, where none has hearkened. THE PROMISE What wonder of what hope do you enfold, Whose eyes are all filled with futurity? What shape of more than beauty would you mould With desire's strength out of the dim to-be? Your bosom is the haunt of holy fears. Shadows are all about you, whispering Deep words and glorious names from the full years; But like the stars in heaven your pulses sing Of a voice sweeter than all tones yet heard; Of a heart richer than the summer's store; Of earth awakened from old bonds and spurred To run a new race for her conqueror. You wait, with thoughts all glowing, like the Night; And in you buds the flower, the marvel, Light. A MOTHER'S SONG Over fast-closed baby eyes In the garden's golden air Blossom-white the butterflies Hover, hurry, part and pair, Sudden shinings, flown nowhere! Blue, above, the unbounded skies! Little one, O downy head, O fingers clasping, shaped and small, Laid in soft nest of your bed, How the trees are Titan-tall Over you that slumber, all Ignorant of hope and dread! O so small, and all around Life so vast works wonders new. Yet to you is set no bound What you shall desire and do, Find and fashion and hold true; Deeps you hold no thought can sound: You are sought by powers unknown; On your trembling heart-strings play Airs unheard, O little one! Whisperings of far away, Music made of day and day— Lands of promise, all your own! Wide as heaven the secrecies You enfold: ev'n now, ev'n here, You presage infinities, While above in hope, in fear, My white wishes, far and near, Hover like the butterflies. ONE YEAR OLD Is it we that are wise, is it we, Who have bought with a price of grief A wisdom seldom free From scorn or disbelief, Who find this world fulfil An end that is not our will, Who toil with the light in our eyes Showing us scarce begun The things we meant to have done, Is it we, is it we, that are wise? Or O, is it you, is it you, That have yet no language of ours, But whose eyes are a laughter blue As of light slipping under the showers, Whose carol, sweeter than words, Trills clear as an April bird's, Or a dancing brook on the hill,— Blithe springs of a confidence That bubbles, we know not whence, And has no knowledge of ill? Lo, our desires have gone Like ships to a future far And vanished in mist alone By no befriending star. But all to you is a wonder Fresh as the sky, whereunder Life moves to pledge delight; You need no hope to bear The day through the day's care; Your joys are all in sight. You want not a word to tell What lies beyond our guess And springs like a sparkling well In a lovely speechlessness. And we that have shaped with art Language of mind and of mart, We have never yet found speech For the heart's blood deepest stirred: Something is flown with a word Or is buried beneath our reach. Our speech is spun from the pain Of thought and heavy with years, And dyed with an ancient stain From passion and blood and tears. But O, I vow, when I hear Your wordless carol clear, I would cast this speech that endures As a sorry old patchwork coat, Could I but re-fill my throat With the liquid joy in yours. BECAUSE THOU ART NEAREST Because thou art nearest To the mystery of the fire That is Earth's and the soul's And the body's desire, Whereof we were made As a song out of sound, Trembling together And together enwound, O frailer, more fading The hope and the lure That are not where thou art:— They fade nor endure, But in thee is the secret, The star, and the fire, Ever nearer and dearer, My joy, my desire. SEVEN YEARS Seven years have flown like seven days, Like seven days of shining weather, Since we, forsaking single ways, Trod earth and faced the skies together. The old is new, the new is old, And who shall reckon, one or seven, The years that Time has never told? He numbers not the days of Heaven. SORROW Woe to him that has not known the woe of man, Who has not felt within him burning all the want Of desolated bosoms, since the world began; Felt, as his own, the burden of the fears that daunt; Who has not eaten failure's bitter bread, and been Among those ghosts of hope that haunt the day, unseen. Only when we are hurt with all the hurt untold,— In us the thirst, the hunger, and ours the helpless hands, The palsied effort vain, the darkness and the cold,— Then, only then, the Spirit knows and understands, And finds in every sigh breathed out beneath the sun The human heart that makes us infinitely one. IN MEMORY Home from the wounds of Earth and wasting Time The marvel of her beauty and morning prime She has taken, glorious with the dew of youth Still on her thoughts, those thoughts that from her eyes Gleamed still or splendid, unafraid of truth; All her white passion, all the secrecies Of wild, sweet fire that her heart guarded, all Her heart's young rose, ere yet one leaf could fade or fall! She that was made like a song nobly wrought In fine, fair mould of movement, speech and thought, With glory of hair about the buoyant head;— In breaking voices we her beauty tell: But she is radiant, she is perfected, Where our long hopes far from our sorrows dwell, A song unended, but a song so sweet, No tongue of mortal dares its melody complete. PAST AND FUTURE Past is the past! But no, it is not past, In us, in us, it quickens, wants, aspires; And on our hearts the unknown dead have cast The hunger and the thirst of their desires. Unknown the pangs, the peace we too prepare! What shakes this bosom shall reverberate Through ages unconceived: in that deep lair The unguessed, unhoped, undreaded issues wait. Our pregnant acts are all unprophesied. We dream sublime conclusions; destine, plan, Build and unbuild; yet turn no jot aside The something infinite that moves in Man. We write The End where fate has scarce begun; And no man knows the thing that he has done. THUNDER ON THE DOWNS Wide earth, wide heaven, and in the summer air Silence! The summit of the Down is bare Between the climbing crests of wood; but those Great sea-winds, wont, when the wet South-West blows, To rock tall beeches and strong oaks aloud And strew torn leaves upon the streaming cloud, To-day are idle, slumbering far aloof. Under the solemn height and gorgeous roof Of cloud-built sky, all earth is indolent. Wandering hum of bees and thymy scent Of the short turf enrich pure loneliness; Scarcely an airy topmost-twining tress Of bryony quivers where the thorn it wreathes; Hot fragrance from the honeysuckle breathes, And sweet the rose floats on the arching briar's Green fountain, sprayed with delicate frail fires. For clumps of thicket, dark beneath the blaze Of the high westering sun, beset the ways Of smooth grass narrowing where the slope runs steep Down to green woods, and glowing shadows keep A freshness round the mossy roots, and cool The light that sleeps as in a chequered pool Of golden air. O woods, I love you well, I love the flowers you hide, your ferny smell; But here is sweeter solitude, for here My heart breathes heavenly space; the sky is near To thought, with heights that fathomlessly glow; And the eye wanders the wide land below. And this is England! June's undarkened green Gleams on far woods; and in the vales between Gray hamlets, older than the trees that shade Their ripening meadows, are in quiet laid, Themselves a part of the warm, fruitful ground. The little hills of England rise around; The little streams that wander from them shine And with their names remembered names entwine Of old renown and honour, fields of blood High causes fought on, stubborn hardihood For freedom spent, and songs, our noblest pride, That in the heart of England never died, And burning still make splendour of our tongue. Glories enacted, spoken, suffered, sung, You lie emblazoned on this land now sleeping; And southward, over leagues of forest sweeping White on the verge glistens the famous sea, That English wave, on which so haughtily Towered her sails, and one sail homeward bore Past capes of silently lamenting shore Victory's dearest dead. O shores of home, Since by the vanished watch-fire shields of Rome Dinted this upland turf, what hearts have ached To see you far away, what eyes have waked Ere dawn to watch those cliffs of long desire One after one rise in their voiceless choir Out of the twilight over the rough blue Like music!... But now heavy gleams imbrue The inland air. Breathless the valleys hold Their colours in a veil of sultry gold With mingled shadows that have ceased to crawl; For far in heaven is thunder! Over all A single cloud in slow magnificence Climbs like a mountain, gradual and immense, With awful head unstirring, and moved on Against the zenith, towers above the sun. And still it thickens luminous fold on fold Of fatal colour, ominously scrolled And fleeced with fire; above the sun it towers Like some vast thought quickening a world not ours Remote in the waste blue, as if behind Its rim were splendour that could smite us blind, So doom-piled and intense it crests heaven's height And mounting makes a menace of the light. A menace! Yes, for when light comes, we fear. Light that may touch, as the pure angel-spear, Us to ourselves, make visible, make start The apparition of the very heart And mystery of our thoughts, awaked from under The mask of cheating habit, and to thunder Bare in a moment of white fire what we Have feared and fled, our own reality. And if a lightning now were loosed in flame Out of the darkness of the cloud to claim Thy heart, O England, how wouldst thou be known In that hour? How to the quick core be shown And seen? What cry should from thy very soul Answer the judgment of that thunder-roll? I hear a voice arraign thee. “Where is now The exaltation that once lit thy brow? Thou countest all thy ocean-sundered lands, Thou heapest up the labours of thy hands, Thou seest all thy ships upon the seas. But in thine own heart mean idolatries Usurp devotion, choke thee and annul Noble excess of spirit, and make dull Thine eyes, enfleshed with much dominion. Art thou so great and is the glory gone? Do these bespeak thy freedom who deflower Time, and make barren every senseless hour, Who from themselves hurry, like men afraid Lest what they are be to themselves betrayed? Or those who in their huddled thousands sweat To buy the sleep that helps them to forget?— Life lies unused, life with its loveliness! While the cry ravens still, “Possess, Possess!” And there is no possession. All the lust Of gainful man is quieted in dust; His faith, his fear, his joy, his doom he owns, No more: the rest is parcelled with his bones, Save what the imagination of his heart Can to the labour of his hands impart, Making stones serve his spirit's desire, and breathe. But thou, what dost thou to the world bequeathe, Who gatherest riches in a waste of mind Unto what end, O confidently blind, Forgetful of the things that grow not old And alone live and are not bought or sold?” Speaks that voice truth? Is it for this that great And tender spirits suffered scorn and hate, Loved to the utmost, poured themselves, gave all Nor counted cost, spirits imperial? Where are they now, they that our memory guard Among the nations? Shall I say enstarred And throned aloof? No, not from heavens of thought Watching our muddied brief procession, not Judges sublime above us, without share In our thronged ways of struggle, hope, despair, But in our blood, our dreams, our deeds they stir, Strive on our lips for language, shame and spur The sluggard in us, out of darkness come Like summoned champions when the world is dumb; Within our hearts they wait with all they gave: Woe to us, woe, if we become their grave! It shall not be. Darken thy pall, and trail, Thunder of heaven, above the valleys pale! Another England in my vision glows. And she is armed within; at last she knows Herself, and what to her own soul belongs. Mid the world's irremediable wrongs She keeps her faith; and nothing of her name Or of her handiwork but doth proclaim Her purpose. Her own soul hath made her free, Not circumstance; she knows no victory Save of the mind: in her is nothing done, No wrong, no shame, no glory of any one, But is the cause of all and each, a thing Felt like a fire to kindle and to sting The proud blood of a nation. On her brows Is hope; her body doth her spirit house Express and eloquent, not dumb and frore; And her voice echoes over sea and shore, And all the lands and isles that are her own In choric interchange and antiphon Answer, as fancy hears in yonder cloud From vale to vale repeated low and loud The still-suspended thunder. Hearts of Youth, High-beating, ardent, quick in hope and ruth And noble anger, O wherever now You dedicate your uncorrupted vow To be an energy of Light, a sword Of the ever-living Will, amid abhorred Din of the reeking street and populous den Where under the great stars blind lusts of men War on each other, or escaped to hills Where peace the solitary evening fills, Or far remote on other soils of earth Keeping the dearness of your fathers' hearth On vast plains of the West, or Austral strands Of the warm under-world, or storied lands Of the orient sun, or over ocean ways Stemming the wave through blue or stormy days, Wherever, as the circling light slopes round, On human lips is heard an English sound, O scattered, silent, hidden, and unknown, Be lifted up, for you are not alone! High-beating hearts, to your deep vows be true! Live out your dreams, for England lives in you. BOOK IV (1914–1920) THE FOURTH OF AUGUST Now in thy splendour go before us, Spirit of England, ardent-eyed, Enkindle this dear earth that bore us, In the hour of peril purified. The cares we hugged drop out of vision, Our hearts with deeper thoughts dilate. We step from days of sour division Into the grandeur of our fate. For us the glorious dead have striven, They battled that we might be free. We to their living cause are given; We arm for men that are to be. Among the nations nobliest chartered, England recalls her heritage. In her is that which is not bartered, Which force can neither quell nor cage. For her immortal stars are burning With her the hope that's never done, The seed that's in the Spring's returning, The very flower that seeks the sun. She fights the force that feeds desire on Dreams of a prey to seize and kill, The barren creed of blood and iron, Vampire of Europe's wasted will... Endure, O Earth! and thou, awaken, Purged by this dreadful winnowing-fan, O wronged, untameable, unshaken Soul of divinely suffering man. STRANGE FRUIT This year the grain is heavy-ripe; The apple shows a ruddier stripe; Never berries so profuse Blackened with so sweet a juice On brambly hedges, summer-dyed. The yellow leaves begin to glide; But Earth in careless lap-ful treasures Pledge of over-brimming measures, As if some rich unwonted zest Stirred prodigal within her breast. And now, while plenty's left uncared, The fruit unplucked, the sickle spared, Where men go forth to waste and spill, Toiling to burn, destroy and kill, Lo, also side by side with these Beast-hungers, ravening miseries, The heart of man has brought to birth Splendours richer than his earth. Now in the thunder-hour of fate Each one is kinder to his mate; The surly smile; the hard forbear; There's help and hope for all to share; And sudden visions of goodwill Transcending all the scope of ill Like a glory of rare weather Link us in common light together, A clearness of the cleansing sun, Where none's alone and all are one; And touching each a priceless pain We find our own true hearts again. No more the easy masks deceive: We give, we dare, and we believe. A NEW IDOL Magnificent the Beast! Look in the eyes Of the fell tiger towering on his prey, Beautiful in his power to pounce and slay And effortless in action. He denies All but himself. He gloats on his weak prize, Roaring the anger of wild breath at bay, Blank anger like an element whose way Is mere annihilation! Terrible eyes! But there is one more to be feared, who can Escape the prison of his own wrath; whose will Lives beyond life; who smiles with quiet lips; Most terrible because most tender, Man,— Not only uncowed but irresistible When the cause fires him to the finger-tips. TO THE BELGIANS O race that Cæsar knew, That won stern Roman praise, What land not envies you The laurel of these days? You built your cities rich Around each towered hall,— Without, the statued niche, Within, the pictured wall. Your ship-thronged wharves, your marts With gorgeous Venice vied. Peace and her famous arts Were yours: though tide on tide Of Europe's battle scourged Black field and reddened soil, From blood and smoke emerged Peace and her fruitful toil. Yet when the challenge rang, “The War-Lord comes; give room!” Fearless to arms you sprang Against the odds of doom. Like your own Damian Who sought that lepers' isle To die a simple man For men with tranquil smile, So strong in faith you dared Defy the giant, scorn Ignobly to be spared, Though trampled, spoiled, and torn, And in your faith arose And smote, and smote again, Till those astonished foes Reeled from their mounds of slain, The faith that the free soul, Untaught by force to quail, Through fire and dirge and dole Prevails and shall prevail. Still for your frontier stands The host that knew no dread, Your little, stubborn land's Nameless, immortal dead. TO WOMEN Your hearts are lifted up, your hearts That have foreknown the utter price. Your hearts burn upward like a flame Of splendour and of sacrifice. For you, you too, to battle go, Not with the marching drums and cheers But in the watch of solitude And through the boundless night of fears. Swift, swifter than those hawks of war, Those threatening wings that pulse the air, Far as the vanward ranks are set, You are gone before them, you are there! And not a shot comes blind with death And not a stab of steel is pressed Home, but invisibly it tore And entered first a woman's breast. Amid the thunder of the guns, The lightnings of the lance and sword Your hope, your dread, your throbbing pride, Your infinite passion is outpoured From hearts that are as one high heart Withholding naught from doom and bale Burningly offered up,—to bleed, To bear, to break, but not to fail! FOR THE FALLEN With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children, England mourns for her dead across the sea. Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit, Fallen in the cause of the free. Solemn the drums thrill: Death august and royal Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres. There is music in the midst of desolation And a glory that shines upon our tears. They went with songs to the battle, they were young, Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow. They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted, They fell with their faces to the foe. They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them. They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; They sit no more at familiar tables of home; They have no lot in our labour of the day-time; They sleep beyond England's foam. But where our desires are and our hopes profound, Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight, To the innermost heart of their own land they are known As the stars are known to the Night; As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust, Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain, As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness, To the end, to the end, they remain. ODE FOR SEPTEMBER I On that long day when England held her breath, Suddenly gripped at heart And called to choose her part Between her loyal soul and luring sophistries, We watched the wide, green-bosomed land beneath Driven and tumultuous skies; We watched the volley of white shower after shower Desolate with fierce drops the fallen flower; And still the rain's retreat Drew glory on its track, And still, when all was darkness and defeat, Upon dissolving cloud the bow of peace shone back. So in our hearts was alternating beat, With very dread elate; And Earth dyed all her day in colours of our fate. II But oh, how faint the image we foretold In fancies of our fear Now that the truth is here! And we awake from dream yet think it still a dream. It bursts our thoughts with more than thought can hold; And more than human seem These agonies of conflict; Elements At war! yet not with vast indifference Casually crushing; nay, It is as if were hurled Lightnings that murdered, seeking out their prey; As if an earthquake shook to chaos half the world, Equal in purpose as in power to slay; And thunder stunned our ears Streaming in rain of blood on torrents that are tears. III Around a planet rolls the drum's alarm. Far where the summer smiles Upon the utmost isles, Danger is treading silent as a fever-breath. Now in the North the secret waters arm; Under the wave is Death: They fight in the very air, the virgin air, Hovering on fierce wings to the onset: there Nations to battle stream; Earth smokes and cities burn; Heaven thickens in a storm of shells that scream; The long lines shattering break, turn and again return; And still across a continent they teem, Moving in myriads; more Than ranks of flesh and blood, but soul with soul at war! IV All the hells are awake: the old serpents hiss From dungeons of the mind; Fury of hate born blind, Madness and lust, despairs and treacheries unclean; They shudder up from man's most dark abyss. But there are heavens serene That answer strength with strength; they stand secure; They arm us from within, and we endure. Now are the brave more brave, Now is the cause more dear, The more the tempests of the darkness rave As, when the sun goes down, the shining stars are clear. Radiant the spirit rushes to the grave. Glorious it is to live In such an hour, but life is lovelier yet to give. V Alas! what comfort for the uncomforted, Who knew no cause, nor sought Glory or gain? they are taught, Homeless in homes that burn, what human hearts can bear. The children stumble over their dear dead, Wandering they know not where. And there is one who simply fights, obeys, Tramps, till he loses count of nights and days, Tired, mired in dust and sweat, Far from his own hearth-stone; A common man of common earth, and yet The battle-winner he, a man of no renown, Where “food for cannon” pays a nation's debt. This is Earth's hero, whom The pride of Empire tosses careless to his doom. VI Now will we speak, while we have eyes for tears And fibres to be wrung And in our mouths a tongue. We will bear wrongs untold but will not only bear; Not only bear, but build through striving years The answer of our prayer, That whosoever has the noble name Of man, shall not be yoked to alien shame; That life shall be indeed Life, not permitted breath Of spirits wrenched and forced to others' need, Robbed of their nature's joy and free alone in death. The world shall travail in that cause, shall bleed, But deep in hope it dwells Until the morning break which the long night foretells. VII O children filled with your own airy glee Or with a grief that comes So swift, so strange, it numbs, If on your growing youth this page of terror bite, Harden not then your senses, feel and be The promise of the light. O heirs of Man, keep in your hearts not less The divine torrents of his tenderness! 'Tis ever war: but rust Grows on the sword; the tale Of earth is strewn with empires heaped in dust Because they dreamed that force should punish and prevail. The will to kindness lives beyond their lust; Their grandeurs are undone: Deep in man's suffering soul are all his victories won. THE ANVIL Burned from the ore's rejected dross The iron whitens in the heat. With plangent strokes of pain and loss The hammers on the iron beat. Searched by the fire, through death and dole We feel the iron in our soul. O dreadful Forge! if torn and bruised The heart, more urgent comes our cry Not to be spared but to be used, Brain, sinew and spirit, before we die. Beat out the iron, edge it keen, And shape us to the end we mean! THE HEALERS In a vision of the night I saw them, In the battles of the night. 'Mid the roar and the reeling shadows of blood They were moving like light, Light of the reason, guarded Tense within the will, As a lantern under a tossing of boughs Burns steady and still. With scrutiny calm, and with fingers Patient as swift They bind up the hurts and the pain-writhen Bodies uplift, Untired and defenceless; around them With shrieks in its breath Bursts stark from the terrible horizon Impersonal death; But they take not their courage from anger That blinds the hot being; They take not their pity from weakness; Tender, yet seeing; Feeling, yet nerved to the uttermost; Keen, like steel; Yet the wounds of the mind they are stricken with, Who shall heal? They endure to have eyes of the watcher In hell, and not swerve For an hour from the faith that they follow, The light that they serve. Man true to man, to his kindness That overflows all, To his spirit erect in the thunder When all his forts fall,— This light, in the tiger-mad welter They serve and they save. What song shall be worthy to sing of them— Braver than the brave? THE ZEPPELIN Guns! far and near, Quick, sudden, angry, They startle the still street. Upturned faces appear, Doors open on darkness, There is a hurrying of feet, And whirled athwart gloom White fingers of alarm Point at last there Where illumined and dumb A shape suspended Hovers, a demon of the starry air! Strange and cold as a dream Of sinister fancy, It charms like a snake, Poised deadly in the gleam, While bright explosions Leap up to it and break. Is it terror you seek To exult in? Know then Hearts are here That the plunging beak Of night-winged Havoc Strikes not with fear So much as it strings To a deep elation And a quivering pride That at last the hour brings For them too the danger Of those who died, Of those who yet fight Spending for each of us Their glorious blood In the foreign night,— That now we are neared to them Thank we God. ORPHANS OF FLANDERS Where is the land that fathered, nourished, poured The sap of a strong race into your veins, Land of wide tilth, of farms and granaries stored, Of old towers chiming over peaceful plains? It is become a vision, barred away Like light in cloud, a memory and belief. On those lost plains the Glory of yesterday Builds her dark towers for the bells of Grief. It is become a splendour-circled name For all the world; a torch against the skies Burns on that blood-spot, the unpardoned shame Of them that conquered: but your homeless eyes See rather some brown pond by a white wall, Red cattle crowding in the rutty lane, A garden where the hollyhocks were tall In the Augusts that shall never be again. There your thoughts cling as the long-thrusting root Clings in the ground; your orphaned hearts are there. O mates of sunburnt earth, your love is mute But strong like thirst and deeper than despair. You have endured what pity can but grope To feel: into that darkness enters none. We have but hands to help; yours is the hope Whose courage rises silent with the sun. THE ENGLISH GRAVES The rains of yesterday are flown, And light is on the farthest hills; The homeliest rough grass by the stone To radiance thrills; And the wet bank above the ditch, Trailing its thorny bramble, shows Soft apparitions, clustered rich, Of the pure primrose. The shining stillness breathes, vibrates From simple earth to lonely sky, A hinted wonder that awaits The heart's reply. O lovely life! the chaffinch sings High on the hazel, near and clear. Sharp to the heart's blood, sweetness springs In the morning here. But my heart goes with the young cloud That voyages the April light Southward, across the beaches loud And cliffs of white To fields of France, far fields that spread Beyond the tumbling of the waves, And touches as with shadowy tread The English graves. There too is Earth that never weeps, The unrepining Earth, that holds The secret of a thousand sleeps And there unfolds Flowers of sweet ignorance on the slope Where strong arms dropped and blood choked breath, Earth that forgets all things but hope And smiles on death. They poured their spirits out in pride, They throbbed away the price of years: Now that dear ground is glorified With dreams, with tears. A flower there is sown, to bud And bloom beyond our loss and smart— Noble France, at its root is blood From England's heart. FETCHING THE WOUNDED At the road's end glimmer the station lights; How small beneath the immense hollow of Night's Lonely and living silence! Air that raced And tingled on the eyelids as we faced The long road stretched between the poplars flying To the dark behind us, shuddering and sighing With phantom foliage, lapses into hush. Magical supersession! The loud rush Swims into quiet: midnight reassumes Its solitude; there's nothing but great glooms, Blurred stars; whispering gusts; the hum of wires. And swerving leftwards upon noiseless tires We glide over the grass that smells of dew. A wave of wonder bathes my body through! For there in the headlamps' gloom-surrounded beam Tall flowers spring before us, like a dream, Each luminous little green leaf intimate And motionless, distinct and delicate With powdery white bloom fresh upon the stem, As if that clear beam had created them Out of the darkness. Never so intense I felt the pang of beauty's innocence, Earthly and yet unearthly. A sudden call! We leap to ground, and I forget it all. Each hurries on his errand; lanterns swing; Dark shapes cross and re-cross the rails; we bring Stretchers, and pile and number them; and heap The blankets ready. Then we wait and keep A listening ear. Nothing comes yet; all's still. Only soft gusts upon the wires blow shrill Fitfully, with a gentle spot of rain. Then, ere one knows it, the long gradual train Creeps quietly in and slowly stops. No sound But a few voices' interchange. Around Is the immense night-stillness, the expanse Of faint stars over all the wounds of France. Now stale odour of blood mingles with keen Pure smell of grass and dew. Now lantern-sheen Falls on brown faces opening patient eyes And lips of gentle answers, where each lies Supine upon his stretcher, black of beard Or with young cheeks; on caps and tunics smeared And stained, white bandages round foot or head Or arm, discoloured here and there with red. Sons of all corners of wide France; from Lille, Douay, the land beneath the invader's heel, Champagne, Touraine, the fisher-villages Of Brittany, the valleyed Pyrenees, Blue coasts of the South, old Paris streets. Argonne Of ever smouldering battle, that anon Leaps furious, brothered them in arms. They fell In the trenched forest scarred with reeking shell. Now strange the sound comes round them in the night Of English voices. By the wavering light Quickly we have borne them, one by one, to the air, And sweating in the dark lift up with care, Tense-sinewed, each to his place. The cars at last Complete their burden: slowly, and then fast We glide away. And the dim round of sky, Infinite and silent, broods unseeingly Over the shadowy uplands rolling black Into far woods, and the long road we track Bordered with apparitions, as we pass, Of trembling poplars and lamp-whitened grass, A brief procession flitting like a thought Through a brain drowsing into slumber; nought But we awake in the solitude immense! But hurting the vague dumbness of my sense Are fancies wandering the night: there steals Into my heart, like something that one feels In darkness, the still presence of far homes Lost in deep country, and in little rooms The vacant bed. I touch the world of pain That is so silent. Then I see again Only those infinitely patient faces In the lantern beam, beneath the night's vast spaces, Amid the shadows and the scented dew; And those illumined flowers, springing anew In freshness like a smile of secrecy From the gloom-buried earth, return to me. The village sleeps; blank walls, and windows barred. But lights are moving in the hushed courtyard As we glide up to the open door. The Chief Gives every man his order, prompt and brief. We carry up our wounded, one by one. The first cock crows: the morrow is begun. THE EBB OF WAR In the seven-times taken and re-taken town Peace! The mind stops; sense argues against sense. The August sun is ghostly in the street As if the Silence of a thousand years Were its familiar. All is as it was At the instant of the shattering: flat-thrown walls; Dislocated rafters; lintels blown awry And toppling over; what were windows, mere Gapings on mounds of dust and shapelessness; Charred posts caught in a bramble of twisted iron; Wires sagging tangled across the street; the black Skeleton of a vine, wrenched from the old house It clung to; a limp bell-pull; here and there Little printed papers pasted on the wall. It is like a madness crumpled up in stone, Laughterless, tearless, meaningless; a frenzy Stilled, like at ebb the shingle in sea-caves Where the imagined weight of water swung Its senseless crash with pebbles in myriads churned By the random seethe. But here was flesh and blood, Seeing eyes, feeling nerves; memoried minds With the habit of the picture of these fields And the white roads crossing the wide green plain, All vanished! One could fancy the very fields Were memory's projection, phantoms! All Silent! The stone is hot to the touching hand. Footsteps come strange to the sense. In the sloped churchyard, Where the tower shows the blue through its great rents, Shadow falls over pitiful wrecked graves, And on the gravel a bare-headed boy, Hands in his pockets, with large absent eyes, Whistles the Marseillaise: To Arms, To Arms! There is no other sound in the bright air. It is as if they heard under the grass, The dead men of the Marne, and their thin voice Used those young lips to sing it from their graves, The song that sang a nation into arms. And far away to the listening ear in the silence Like remote thunder throb the guns of France. MID ATLANTIC If this were all!—A dream of dread Ran through me; I watched the waves that fled Pale-crested out of hollows black, The hungry lift of helpless waves, A million million tossing graves, A wilderness without a track Beneath the barren moon: If this were all! The stars of night remotely strewn Looked on that restless heave and fall. I seemed with them to watch this old Bright planet through the ages rolled, Self-tortured, burning splendours vain, And fevered with its greeds insane, And with the blood of peoples red; I watched it, grown an ember cold, Join in the dancing of the dead. The chilly half-moon sank; the sound Of naked surges roared around, And through my heart the darkness poured Surges as of a sea unshored. O somewhere far and lost from light Blind Europe battled in the night! Then sudden through the darkness came The vision of a child, A child with feet as light as flame Who ran across the bitter waves, Across the tumbling of the graves— With arms stretched out he smiled. I drank the wine of life again, I breathed among my brother men, I felt the human fire. I knew that I must serve the will Of beauty and love and wisdom still; Though all my hopes were overthrown, Though universes turned to stone, I have my being in this alone And die in that desire. On Board the “Lusitania,” December, 1914 GALLIPOLI Isles of the Aegean, Troy, and waters of Hellespont! You we have known from of old, Since boyhood stammering glorious Greek was entranced In the tale that Homer told. There scornful Achilles towered and flamed through the battle, Defying the gods; and there Hector armed, and Andromache proudly held up his boy to him, Knowing not yet despair. We beheld them as presences moving beautiful and swift In the radiant morning of Time, Far from reality, far from dullness of daily doing And from cities of fog and grime;— Unattainable day-dream, heroes, gods and goddesses Matched in splendour of war, Days of a vanished world, days of a grandeur perished, Days that should bloom no more. But now shall our boyhood learn to tell a new tale, And a new song shall be sung, And the sound of it shall praise not magnificence of old time But the glory and the greatness of the young. Deeds of this our own day, marvellous deeds of our own blood; Sons that their sires excel, Lightly going into peril and taking death by the hand;— Of these they shall sing, they shall tell. How in ships sailing the famed Mediterranean From armed banks of Nile, Men from far homes in sunny Austral Dominions And the misty mother-isle, Met in the great cause, joined in the vast adventure, Saw first in April skies Beyond storied islands, Gallipoli's promontory Impregnably ridged, arise. And how from the belly of the black ship, driven beneath Towering scarp and scaur Hailing hidden rages of fire in terrible gusts On the murdered space of shore, Into the water they leapt, they rushed and across the beach, With impetuous shout, all Inspired beyond men, climbed and were over the crest As a flame leaps over a wall. Not all the gods in heaven's miraculous panoply Could have hindered or stayed them, so Irresistibly came they, scaled the unscaleable and sprang To stab the astonished foe, Marvellous doers of deeds, lifted past our imagining To a world where death is nought! As spirit against spirit, as a liberated element, As fire in flesh they fought. Now to the old twilight and pale legendary glories, By our own youth outdone, Those shores recede; not there, but in memory everlasting The immortal heights were won. Of them that triumphed, of them that fell, there is only now Silence, and sleep, and fame, And in night's immensity far on that promontory's altar An invisibly burning flame. THE DISTANT GUNS Negligently the cart-track descends into the valley; The drench of the rain has passed and the clover breathes; Scents are abroad; in the valley a mist whitens Along the hidden river, where the evening smiles. The trees are asleep, their shadows are longer and longer, Melting blue in the tender twilight; above, In a pallor, barred with lilac and ashen cloud, Delicate as a spirit the young moon brightens, And distant a bell intones the hour of peace, Where roofs of the village, gray and red, cluster In leafy dimness. Peace, old as the world! The crickets shrilling in the high wet grass, And gnats, clouding upon the frail wild roses, Murmur of you: but hark! like a shudder upon the air, Ominous and alien, knocking on the farther hills As with airy hammers, the ghosts of terrible sound,— Guns! From afar they are knocking on human hearts Everywhere over the silent evening country, Knocking with fear and dark presentiment. Only The moon's beauty, where no life nor joy is, Brightening softly and knowing nothing, has peace. MEN OF VERDUN There are five men in the moonlight That by their shadows stand: Three hobble humped on crutches, And two lack each a hand. Frogs somewhere near the roadside Chorus a chant absorbed; But a hush breathes out of the dream-light That far in heaven is orbed. It is gentle as sleep falling And wide as thought can span, The ancient peace and wonder That brims the heart of man. Beyond the hills it shines now On no peace but the dead, On reek of trenches thunder-shocked, Tense fury of wills in wrestle locked, A chaos crumbled red! The five men in the moonlight Chat, joke, or gaze apart. They talk of days and comrades; But each one hides his heart. They wear clean cap and tunic, As when they went to war. A gleam comes where the medal's pinned: But they will fight no more. The shadows, maimed and antic, Gesture and shape distort, Like mockery of a demon dumb Out of the hell-din whence they come That dogs them for his sport. But as if dead men were risen And stood before me there With a terrible flame about them blown In beams of spectral air, I see them, men transfigured As in a dream, dilate Fabulous with the Titan-throb Of battling Europe's fate; For history's hushed before them, And legend flames afresh. Verdun, the name of thunder, Is written on their flesh. LA PATRIE Through storm-blown gloom the subtle light persists; Shapes of tumultuous, ghostly cloud appear, Trailing a dark shower from hill-drenching mists: Dawn, desolate in its majesty, is here. But ere the wayside trees show leaf and form Invisible larks in all the air around Ripple their songs up through the gloom and storm, As if the baulked light had won wings of sound! A wounded soldier on his stretcher waits His turn for the ambulance, by the glimmering rails; He is wrapped in a rough brown blanket, like his mates: Over him the dawn broadens, the cloud pales. Muscular, swart, bearded, and quite still, He lies, too tired to think, to wonder. Drops From a leaf fall by him. For spent nerve and will The world of shattering and stunned effort stops. He feels the air, song-thrilled and fresh and dim And close about him smells the rainy soil. It is ever-living Earth recovers him, Friend and companion of old, fruitful toil. He is patient with her patience. Hurt, he takes Strength from her rooted, still tenacities. The will to heal, that secretly re-makes, Like slumber, holds his dark, contented eyes. For she, though—never reckoning of the cost— Full germs of all profusion she prepares, Knows tragic hours, too, parching famine, frost, And wreck; and in her children's hurt she shares. Build what we may, house us in lofty mind's Palaces, wean the fine-wrought spirit apart, Earth touches where the fibre throbs, and winds The threads about us of her infinite heart. And some dear ground with its own changing sky, As if it were our feeling flesh, is wrought Into the very body's dignity And private colour of least conscious thought. O when that loud invader burned and bruised This ordered land's old kindness, with brute blows Shamed and befouled and plundered and abused, Was it not Earth that in her soldier rose And armed him, terrible and simple? He Takes his wound, mute as Earth is, yet as strong.— The funeral clouds trail, wet wind shakes the tree, But all the wild air of the dawn is song. Latrecy, 1916 GOING WEST Just as I came Into the empty, westward-facing room, A sudden gust blew wide The tall window; at once A shock of sudden light, vibrating like a flame, Entered, as if it were the wind's bright spirit Stealing to me upon some secret quest. The wonder of the West Burst open: under dark and rushing cloud That rained illumined drops, it glorified Each corner where so dazzlingly it struck: The shadows cowered, the brilliance overflowed. As suddenly, all faded. Wet, wild air blew in At the idly-swinging door Stormily crumpled fallen shreds of leaves, Dried scarlet and burnt yellow and ashy brown: They fluttered in like fears and blew across the floor And I, to the heart invaded, Felt as that wild light palpitated through me And died in a moment down, Exalted by a visionary fear That from the light more than the shadow fell; A divination of splendid spirits near, Of glorious parting and of great farewell. THE BEREAVED We grudged not those that were dearer than all we possessed, Lovers, brothers, sons. Our hearts were full, and out of a full heart We gave our belovèd ones. Because we loved, we gave. In the hardest hour When at last—so much unsaid In the eyes—they went, simply, with tender smile, Our hearts to the end they read. They to their deeds! To things that their soul hated, And yet to splendours won From smoking hell by the spirit that moved in them: But we to endure alone. Their hearts rested on ours; their homing thoughts Met ours in the still of the night. We ached with the ache of the long waiting, and throbbed With the throbs of the surging fight. O had we failed them, then were we desolate now And separated indeed. What should have comforted, what should have helped us then In the time of our bitter need! But now, though sorrow be ever fresh, sorrow Is tender as love; it knows That of love it was born, and Love with the shining eyes The hard way chose. And out of deeps eternal, night and day, A strength our sorrow frees, Flooding us, full as the tide up the rivers flows From the depth of the silent seas; A strength that is mightier far than we, yet a strength Whereof our spirit is breath, Hope of the world, that is strange to hazard and fear, To the wounds of Time, and Death. MORN LIKE A THOUSAND SHINING SPEARS Morn like a thousand shining spears Terrible in the East appears. O hide me, leaves of lovely gloom, Where the young Dreams like lilies bloom! What is this music that I lose Now, in a world of fading clues? What wonders from beyond the seas And wild Arabian fragrancies? In vain I turn me back to where Stars made a palace of the air. In vain I hide my face away From the too bright invading Day. That which is come requires of me My utter truth and mystery. Return, you dreams, return to Night: My lover is the armèd Light. THE NEW WORLD To the People of the United States Now is the time of the splendour of Youth and Death. The spirit of man grows grander than men knew. The unbearable burden is borne, the impossible done; Though harder is yet to do Before this agony end, and that be won We seek through blinding battle, in choking breath,— The New World, seen in vision! Land of lands, In the midst of storms that desolate and divide, In the hour of the breaking heart, O far-descried, You build our courage, you hold up our hands. Men of America, you that march to-day Through roaring London, supple and lean of limb, Glimpsed in the crowd I saw you, and in your eye Something alert and grim, As knowing on what stern call you march away To the wrestle of nations; saw your heads held high And, that same moment, far in a glittering beam High over old and storied Westminster The Stars and Stripes with England's flag astir, Sisterly twined and proud on the air astream. Men of America, what do you see? Is it old Towers of fame and grandeur time-resigned? The frost of custom's backward-gazing thought? Seek closer! You shall find Miracles hour by hour in silence wrought; Births, and awakenings; dyings never tolled; Invisible crumble and fall of prison-bars. O, wheresoever his home, new or decayed, Man is older than all the things he has made And yet the youngest spirit beneath the stars. Rock-cradled, white, and soaring out of the sea, I behold again the fabulous city arise, Manhattan! Queen of thronged and restless bays And of daring ships is she. O lands beyond, that into the sunset gaze, Limitless, teeming continent of surmise! I drink again that diamond air, I thrill To the lure of a wonder more than the wondrous past, And see before me ages yet more vast Rising, to challenge heart and mind and will. What sailed they out to seek, who of old came To that bare earth and wild, unhistoried coast? Not gold, nor granaries, nay, nor a halcyon ease For the weary and tempest-tost: The unshaken soul they sought, possessed in peace. What seek we now, and hazard all on the aim? In the heart of man is the undiscovered earth Whose hope's our compass; sweet with glorious passion Of men's good-will; a world to forge and fashion Worthy the things we have seen and brought to birth. Taps of the Drum! Now once again they beat: And the answer comes; a continent arms. Dread, Pity, and Grief, there is no escape. The call Is the call of the risen Dead. Terrible year of the nations' trampling feet! An angel has blown his trumpet over all From the ends of the earth, from East to uttermost West, Because of the soul of man, that shall not fail, That will not make refusal, or turn, or quail, No, nor for all calamity, stay its quest. And here, here too, is the New World, born of pain In destiny-spelling hours. The old world breaks Its mould, and life runs fierce and fluid, a stream That floods, dissolves, re-makes. Each pregnant moment, charged to its extreme, Quickens unending future, and all's vain But the onward mind, that dares the oncoming years And takes their storm, a master. Life shall then Transfigure Time with yet more marvellous men. Hail to the sunrise! Hail to the Pioneers! THE SOWER (Eastern France) Familiar, year by year, to the creaking wain Is the long road's level ridge above the plain. To-day a battery comes with horses and guns On the straight road, that under the poplars runs, At leisurely pace, the guns with mouths declined, Harness merrily ringing, and dust behind. Makers of widows, makers of orphans, they Pass to their burial business, alert and gay. But down in the field, where sun has the furrow dried, Is a man who walks in the furrow with even stride. At every step, with elbow jerked across, He scatters seed in a quick, deliberate toss, The immemorial gesture of Man confiding To Earth, that restores tenfold in a season's gliding. He is grave and patient, sowing his children's bread: He treads the kindly furrow, nor turns his head. STONEHENGE Gaunt on the cloudy plain Stand the great Stones, Dwarfed in the vast reach Of a sky that owns All the measure of earth Within its cloud-hung cave. Dumb stands the Circle As on a God's grave. But clattering with horses Up from the valley, With horses and horsemen At a trot, gaily Dragging the limbered guns, Youth comes riding,— Easy sits, mettlesome Horses bestriding. Fast come the twinkling hoofs, Light wheels and guns, Invading the upland, And sweep past the Stones. Giant those shapes now Over them tower,— Time's dark stature Over Youth's fleet hour. Ribs of dismemoried Earth, Guard what you may! The Immortals also Pass, nor stay. GUNS AT THE FRONT Man, simple and brave, easily confiding, Giving his all, glad of the sun's sweetness, Heeding little of pitiful incompleteness, Mending life with laughter and cheerful chiding, Where is he?—I see him not, but I hear Sounds, charged with nothing but death and maiming; Earth and sky empty of all but flaming Bursts, and shocks that stun the waiting ear; Monsters roaring aloud with hideous vastness, Nothing, Nothing, Nothing! And man that made them Mightier far than himself, has stooped, and obeyed them, Schooled his mind to endure its own aghastness, Serving death, destruction, and things inert,— He the soarer, free of heavens to roam in, He whose heart has a world of light to home in, Confounding day with darkness, flesh with dirt. Oh, dear indeed the cause that so can prove him, Pitilessly self-tested! If no cause beaconed Beyond this chaos, better he bled unreckoned, With his own monsters bellowing madness above him. THE WITNESSES I Lads in the loose blue, Crutched, with limping feet, With bandaged arm, that roam To-day the bustling street, You humble us with your gaze, Calm, confiding, clear; You humble us with a smile That says nothing but cheer. Our souls are scarred with you! Yet, though we suffered all You have suffered, all were vain To atone, or to recall The robbed future, or build The maimed body again Whole, or ever efface What men have done to men. II Each body of straight youth, Strong, shapely, and marred, Shines as out of a cloud Of storm and splintered shard, Of chaos, torture, blood, Fire, thunder, and stench: And the savage shattering noise Of churned and shaken trench Echoes through myriad hearts In the dumb lands behind;— Silent wailing, and bitter Tears of the world's mind! You stand upon each threshold Without complaint.—What pen Dares to write half the deeds That men have done to men? III Must we be humbled more? Peace, whose olive seems A tree of hope and heaven, Of answered prayers and dreams, Peace has her own hid wounds; She also grinds and maims. And must we bear and share Those old continued shames? Not only the body's waste But the mind's captivities— Crippled, sore, and starved— The ignorant victories Of the visionless, who serve No cause, and fight no foe! Is a cruelty less sure Because its ways are slow? Now we have eyes to see. Shall we not use them then? These bright wounds witness What men may do to men. I AM HERE, AND YOU I am here, and you; The sun blesses us through Leaves made of light. The air is in your hair; You hold a flower. O worlds, that roll through night, O Time, O terrible year, Where surges of fury and fear Rave, to us you gave This island-hour. DARK WIND In the middle of the night, waking, I was aware Of the Wind like one riding through black wastes of the air, Moodily riding, ever faster, he recked not where. The windows rattled aloud: a door clashed and sprang; And the ear in fear waited to feel the inert clang Strike the shaken darkness, a cruelty and a pang. I was hurt with pity of things that have no will of their own, Lifted in lives of others and cast on bruising stone: I feared the Wind, coming a power from worlds unknown. It was like a great ship now, abandoned, her crew dead, Driving in gulfs of sky; it staggered above and sped; I lay in the deeps and heard it rushing over my head. And the helpless shaking of window and door's desolate rebound Seemed like tossing and lifting of bodies lost and drowned In the huge indifferent swell, in the waters' wandering sound. HUNGER I come among the peoples like a shadow. I sit down by each man's side. None sees me, but they look on one another, And know that I am there. My silence is like the silence of the tide That buries the playground of children; Like the deepening of frost in the slow night, When birds are dead in the morning. Armies trample, invade, destroy, With guns roaring from earth and air. I am more terrible than armies, I am more feared than the cannon. Kings and chancellors give commands; I give no command to any; But I am listened to more than kings And more than passionate orators. I unswear words, and undo deeds. Naked things know me. I am first and last to be felt of the living. I am Hunger. STRIKE STONE ON STEEL Strike stone on steel, Fire replies. Strike men that feel, The answer is in their eyes. Powers that are willed to break The spirit in limbs of pain, See what spirit you wake! Strike, and strike again! You hammer sparks to a flame, And the flame scorches your hand. You have given the feeble an aim, You have made the sick to stand. You shape by stroke on stroke Man mightier than he knew; And the fire your hammer woke Is a life that is death to you. SPRING HAS LEAPT INTO SUMMER Spring has leapt into Summer. A glory has gone from the green. The flush of the poplar has sobered out, The flame in the leaf of the lime is dulled: But I am thinking of the young men Whose faces are no more seen. Where is the pure blossom That fell and refused to grow old? The clustered radiance, perfumed whiteness, Silent singing of joy in the blue? —I am thinking of the young men Whose splendour is under the mould. Youth, the wonder of the world, Opened-eyed at an opened door, When the world is as honey in the flower, and as wine To the heart, and as music newly begun! O the young men, the myriads of the young men, Whose beauty returns no more! Spring will come, when the Earth remembers, In sun-bursts after the rain, And the leaf be fresh and lovely on the bough, And the myriad shining blossom be born: But I shall be thinking of the young men Whose eyes will not shine on us again. THE ENGLISH YOUTH There is a dimness fallen on old fames. Our hearts are solemnized with dearer names Than Time is bright with: we have not heard alone, Or read of it in books; it is our own Eyes that have seen this wonder; like a song, It is in our mouths for ever. There was wrong Done, and the world shamed. Honour blew the call; And each one's answer was as natural And quiet as the needle's to the pole. Who gave must give himself entire and whole. So, books were shut; and young dreams shaken out In cold air; dear ambitions done without, And a stark duty shouldered. And yet they Who now must narrow to their arduous day Did not forget their nurture, nor the kind Muses of earth, nor joys of eager mind,— Graced in their comradeship, and prizing more Life's beauty, and all the sweetness at the core, Because of that loathed business they were set To do and finish. It was the world's debt, Claiming all: but they knew, and would not wince From that exaction on their flesh; and since They did not seek for glory, our hearts add A more than glory to that hope they had And gloriously and terribly achieved. O histories of old time, half-believed, None needs to wrong the modesty of truth In matching with your legend England's youth! But all renown that fearless arms could win For proud adventuring wondrous Paladin Is glimmering laurel now: Romance, that was The coloured air of a forgotten cause About the heads of heroes dead and bright, Shines home. We are accompanied with light Because of youth among us; and the name Of man is touched with an ethereal flame; There is a newness in the world begun, A difference in the setting of the sun. OXFORD IN WAR-TIME What alters you, familiar lawn and tower, Arched alley, and garden green to the gray wall With crumbling crevice and the old wine-red flower, Solitary in summer sun? for all Is like a dream: I tread on dreams! No stir Of footsteps, voices, laughter! Even the chime Of many-memoried bells is lonelier In this neglected ghostliness of Time. What stealing touch of separation numb Absents you? Yet my heart springs up to adore The shrining of your soul, that is become Nearer and oh, far dearer than before. It is as if I looked on the still face Of a Mother, musing where she sits alone. She is with her sons, she is not in this place; She is gone out into far lands unknown. Because that filled horizon occupies Her heart with mute prayer and divining fear, Therefore her hands so calm lie, and her eyes See nothing; and men wonder at her here: But far in France; on the torn Flanders plain; By Sinai; in the Macedonian snows; The fly-plagued sands of Tigris, heat and rain; On wandering water, where the black squall blows Less danger than the bright wave ambushes, She bears it out. All the long day she bears And the sudden hour of instant challenges To act, that searches all men, no man spares. She is with her sons, leaving a virtue gone Out of her sacred places: what she bred Lives other life than this, that sits alone, Though still in dream starrily visited! For O in youth she lives, not in her age! Her soul is with the springtime and the young; And she absents her from the learned page, Studious of high histories yet unsung, More passionately prized than wisdom's book Because her own. Her faith is in those eyes That clear into the gape of hell can look, Putting to proof ancient philosophies Such as the virgin Muses would rehearse Beside the silvery, swallow-haunted stream, Under the gray towers. But immortal verse Is now exchanged for its immortal theme— Victory; proud loss; and the enduring mind; Youth, that has passed all praises, and has won More than renown, being that which faith divined, Reality more radiant than the sun. She gave, she gives, more than all anchored days Of dedicated lore, of storied art; And she resigns her beauty to men's gaze To mask the riches of her bleeding heart. KITCHENER This is the man who, sole in Britain, sole In Europe, by profounder instinct knew The strength of Britain; and that strength he drew Slow into act, upshouldering the whole Vast weight of effort. Eyes full on the goal Saw nothing less; he held his single clue, Heedless of obstacle; intent to do His one task forthright with unshaken soul. This is the man whom, dead, the meanest match With their own stature; give tongue, and grow brave On the imperfection fools have wit to espy. His silence towers the grander for their cry, Troubling his fame no more than yelp and scratch Of jackal could disturb that ocean-grave. THE TEST Naked reality, and menace near As fire to scorching flesh, shall not affright The spirit that sees, with danger-sharpened sight, What it must save or die for; not the mere Name, but the thing, now doubly, trebly dear, Freedom; the breath those hands would choke; the light They would put out; the clean air they would blight, Making earth rank with hate, and greed, and fear. Now no man's loss is private: all share all. Oh, each of us a soldier stands to-day, Put to the proof and summoned to the call; One will, one faith, one peril. Hearts, be high, Most in the hour that's darkest! Come what may, The soul in us is found, and shall not die. YPRES She was a city of patience; of proud name, Dimmed by neglecting Time; of beauty and loss; Of acquiescence in the creeping moss. But on a sudden fierce destruction came Tigerishly pouncing: thunderbolt and flame Showered on her streets, to shatter them and toss Her ancient towers to ashes. Riven across, She rose, dead, into never-dying fame. White against heavens of storm, a ghost, she is known To the world's ends. The myriads of the brave Sleep round her. Desolately glorified, She, moon-like, draws her own far-moving tide Of sorrow and memory; toward her, each alone, Glide the dark Dreams that seek an English grave. THE ARRAS ROAD I The early night falls on the plain In cloud and desolating rain. I see no more, but feel around The ruined earth, the wounded ground. There in the dark, on either side The road, are all the brave who died. I think not on the battles won; I think on those whose day is done. Heaped mud, blear pools, old rusted wire, Cover their youth and young desire. Near me they sleep, and they to me Are dearer than their victory. II Where now are they who once had peace Here, and the fruitful tilth's increase? Shattered is all their hands had made, And the orchards where their children played. But night, that brings the darkness, brings The heart back to its dearest things. I feel old footsteps plodding slow On ways that they were used to know. And from my own land, past the strait, From homes that no more news await, Absenting thoughts come hither flying To the unknown earth where Love is lying. There are no stars to-night, but who Knows what far eyes of lovers true In star-like vigil, each alone Are watching now above their own? III England and France unconscious tryst Keep in this void of shadowy mist By phantom Vimy, and mounds that tell Of ghostliness that was Gavrelle. The rain comes wildly down to drench Disfeatured ridge, deserted trench. Guns in the night, far, far away Thud on the front beyond Cambrai. But here the night is holy, and here I will remember, and draw near, And for a space, till night be sped, Be with the beauty of the dead. AN INCIDENT AT CAMBRAI In a by-street, blocked with rubble And any-way-tumbled stones, Between the upstanding house-fronts' Naked and scorched bones, Chinese workmen were clearing The ruins, dusty and arid. Dust whitened the motley coats, Where each his burden carried. Silent they glided, all Save one, who passed me by With berry-brown high-boned cheeks And strange Eastern eye. And he sang in his outland tongue Among those ruins drear A high, sad, half-choked ditty That no one heeded to hear. Was it love, was it grief, that made For long-dead lips that song? The desolation of Han Or the Never-Ending Wrong? The Rising Sun and the Setting, They have seen this all as a scroll Blood-smeared, that the endless years For the fame of men unroll. It was come from the ends of the earth And of Time in his ruin gray, That song,—the one human sound In the silence of Cambrai. October, 1918 THE UNRETURNING SPRING A leaf on the gray sand-path Fallen, and fair with rime! A yellow leaf, a scarlet leaf, And a green leaf ere its time. Days rolled in blood, days torn, Days innocent, days burnt black, What is it the wind is sighing As the leaves float, swift or slack? The year's pale spectre is crying For beauty invisibly shed, For the things that never were told And were killed in the minds of the dead. PEACE I Lovely word flying like a bird across the narrow seas, When winter is over and songs are in the skies, Peace, with the colour of the dawn upon the name of her, A music to the ears, a wonder to the eyes; Peace, bringing husband back to wife and son to mother soon, And lover to his love, and friend to friend, Peace, so long awaited and hardly yet believed in, The answer of faith, enduring to the end; Tears are in our joy, because the heavy night is gone from us And morning brings the prisoner's release. How shall we sing her beauty and her blessedness, Saying at last to one another, Peace? II Guns that boomed from shore to shore And smote the heart with distant dread Speak no more. The terror that bestrode the air, That under ocean kept his lair, Now is fled. III I see, as on a misty morn When a great ship towering glides To anchor, out of battle borne, And looms above her dinted sides,— Burning through the mist at last The sun flames on her splintered mast And the torn flag that from it floats, And cheering from a thousand throats Bursts from her splendour and her scars,— So I see our England come, Come at last from all her wars Proudly home. IV Now let us praise the dead that are with us to-day Who fought and fell before the morning shone, Happy and brave, an innumerable company; This day is theirs, the day their deeds have won Glory to them, and from our hearts a thanksgiving In humbleness and awe and joy and pride. We will not say that their place shall know no more of them, We will not say that they have passed and died: They are the living, they that bought this hour for us And spilt their blood to make the world afresh. One with us, one with our children and their heritage, They live and move, a spirit in the flesh. V With innocence of flowers and grass and dew Earth covers up her shame, her wounds, her rue. She pardons and remits; she gives her grace, Where men had none, and left so foul a trace. Peace of the earth, peace of the sky, begins To sweeten and to cleanse our strifes and sins, The furious thunderings die away and cease. But what is won, unless the soul win peace? VI Not with folding of the hands, Not with evening fallen wide Over waste and weary lands, Peace is come; but as a bride. It is the trumpets of the dawn that ring; It is the sunrise that is challenging. VII Lovely word, flying like a light across the happy Land, When the buds break and all the earth is changed, Bringing back the sailor from his watch upon the perilled seas, Rejoining shores long severed and estranged, Peace, like the Spring, that makes the torrent dance afresh And bursts the bough with sap of beauty pent, Flower from our hearts into passionate recovery Of all the mind lost in that banishment. Come to us mighty as a young and glad deliverer From wrong's old canker and out-dated lease, Then will we sing thee in thy triumph and thy majesty, Then from our throes shall be prepared our peace. IN MEMORY OF RICHARD HENRY POWELL 2nd Lieut., Cinque Ports Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment Strong, loyal-souled, full-hearted, blithely brave, Only remembering love knows all he gave: Beautiful be the stars above his grave. IN MEMORY OF GEORGE CALDERON Wisdom and Valour, Faith, Justice,—the lofty names Of virtue's quest and prize,— What is each but a cold wraith Until it lives in a man And looks thro' a man's eyes? On Chivalry as I muse, The spirit so high and clear It cannot soil with aught It meets of foul misuse; It turns wherever burns The flame of a brave thought; And wheresoever the moan Of the helpless and betrayed Calls, from near or far, It replies as to its own Need, and is armed and goes Straight to its sure pole-star;— No legendary knight Renowned in an ancient cause I warm my thought upon. There comes to the mind's sight One whom I knew, whose hand Grasped mine: George Calderon. Him now as of old I see Carrying his head with an air Courteous and virile, With the charm of a nature free, Daring, resourceful, prompt, In his frank and witty smile. By Oxford towers and streams Who shone among us all In body and brain so bold? Who shaped so firm his themes Crystal-hard in debate? And who hid a heart less cold? Lover of strange tongues, Whether in snowy Russia, Or tropic island bowers Listening to the songs Of the soft-eyed islanders, Crowned with Tahitian flowers, A maker of friends he went. Yet who divined him wholly Or his secret chivalries?— Was all that accomplishment, Wit, alertness, grace, But a kind of blithe disguise? Restless in curious thought And subtle exploring mind, He mixt his modern vein With a strain remotely brought From an older blood than ours, Proud loyalties of Spain. Was it the soul of a sword? For a bright sword leapt from sheath Upon that August day When war's full thunder stored Over Europe, suddenly crashed, And a choice upon each man lay. Others had left their youth In the taming years; and some Doubted; some made moan. To meet the peril of truth With aught but a gay courage Was not for Calderon. Wounded from France he came. His spirit halted not; In that long battle afar, Fruitless in all but fame, Athos and Ida saw Where sank his gallant star. O well could I set my mood To a mournful falling measure For a friend dear and dead! And well could memory brood Singing of youth's delight And lost adventure fled. But that so fearless friend With his victorious smile My mourning mood has chid. He went to the very end; He counted not the cost; What he believed, he did. WINGLESS VICTORY I Victory! Was that proud word once so dear? Are difficulty, patience, effort hard As danger's edge, disputing yard by yard The adversary without and the mind's fear, Are these our only angels? friends austere That find our hidden greatness out, and guard From the weak hour's betrayal faith unmarred! For look! how we seem fall'n from what we were. Worms feed upon the bodies of the brave Who bled for us: but we bewildered see Viler worms gnaw the things they died to save. Old clouds of doubt and weariness oppress. Happy the dead, we cry, not now to be In the day of this dissolving littleness! II O you dear Dead, pardon! For not resigned, We see, though humbled, half our purpose bent And our hope blurred, like men in banishment. Giants amid a blank mist groping blind, The nations ache. And old greeds unconfined Possess men, sick at battle's blood hot-spent Yet sleek and busy and righteously content To wage war, safe and secret, on their kind. If all were simple as the way of hate! But we must reap where others sowed the seed In time long past, of folly and pride and greed; Confused with names, idols and polities; Though over all earth, where we think a State, There are but men and women; only these. III Victory, winged, has flown far off again. She is in the soul, she travels with the light. We see her on the distant mountain height Desired, but she has left us in the plain, Left us awhile, to chafe and to complain, Yet keep our wills, in this dark time's despite, Like those that went up to the horrible fight Beneath their burdens, plodding in the rain. Courage! The same stuff that so greatly bore And greatly did, is here, for gods to find, And the dear human cause in the heart's core. Be the task always harder than we know, And victory further, yet in pain we grow. The vision is before us, not behind. A DAFFODIL Pure-throated Flower, Smelling of Spring, Shaped beyond art's Imagining; Fathomless colour, Breathed as an ether Of flame and of stillness Melted together; Soul of the sun's beam Changed to fairy Flesh, so delicate, Poised and airy! I think of my own kind, Hardly winning A thousand battles For joy's beginning; Victory bloody And with evil shared, Splendour soiled And greatness snared; Truth conceded Or won by halves, Pitiful sores And sorrier salves; Blind authority Treading like oxen's heels All that sees clearest, All that most feels. But you are absolute (Follow who can!) As a commandment Of God to man. Straight you spring And whole you spend, And fall upon fruitful earth, Clean to the end. O to be pure As a single sense, Keen as scorn, As love intense, To live in the light, And to die in a deed That is faith's Amen And has sown its seed! THE SECRET I I lay upon my bed in the great night: The sense of my body drowsed; But a clearness yet lingered in the spirit, By soft obscurity housed. As an inn to a traveller on a long road, Happy sleep appeared. I should come there, to the room of waiting dreams, In the time that slowly neared; But still amid memory's wane fancy delighted, Like wings in the afterglow Dipping to the freshness of the waves of living, To recover from long-ago A touch or a voice, then soaring aloft and afar The free world to range. At last, on the brink of the dark, by subtle degrees Came a chilling and a change. Solitude sank to my marrow and pierced my veins. Though I roam and though I learn All the wonder of earth and of men, it is here In the end I must return, To the something alone that in each of us breathes and sleeps, Profound, isolate, still, And must brave the giant world, and from hour to hour Must prove its own will; To this self, unexcused and unglorified, drawn From its fond shadows, and bare, Wherein no man that has been, none that is or shall be, Shares, or can ever share. And it tingled through me how all use and disguise Hide nothing: none Avails to shield, neither pleader nor protector, But the truth of myself alone. And the days that have made me, have I not made them also? Are they not drops of my blood? What have I done with them? Flower they still within me, Or lie, trodden in the mud? Why for god-like freedom an irreplaceable Here, An irrevocable Now? They were heavy like strong chains about my bosom, Like hard bonds upon my brow. The moments oozing out of the silence seemed From my very heart lost In the stream of the worlds: I felt them hot like tears And of more than riches' cost. Yet what was it alien in me stood and rebelled And cried, Nevertheless My passion is mine, my strength and my frailty; I am not Thrall unto Time's duress! Then suddenly rose before me, older than all, Night of the soft speech, With murmur of tender winds, yet terrible with stars Beyond fancy's reach; Without foundation, without summit, without Haven or refuge, Night Palpitating with stars that dizzy thought and desire In their unimagined flight, O these most terrible! vast surmises, touching The pulse of a fear unknown, Where all experience breaks like a frail bubble, And the soul is left alone, Alone and abandoned of all familiar uses,— Itself the only place It knows,—a question winged, barbed and burning In the answerless frost of Space. I was afraid; but my heart throbbed faster, fiercer. I trembled, but cried anew: I am strange to you, O Stars! O Night, I am your exile, I have no portion in you. Though you shall array your silences against me, I know you and defy. Though I be but a moth in an abyss of ages, This at least is not yours; it is I. II O blessèd be the touch of thought That marries moments from afar, That finds the thing it had not sought, And smells a spice no treasure bought, And learns what never sages taught, And sees this earth a dazzling star! As in the sheen of a lamp unseen, The lamp of memory shrouded long, There sprang before me, sweet as song, The vision of a branch of bloom, A swaying branch of blossom scented; And in that bloom amid the gloom My heart was luminously tented. III A score of years was melted, and I was young And the world young with me, When in innocence of delight I laid me down Beneath a certain tree. The breathing splendour of that remembered May Had yet seven days to spill In fragrant showers of fairy white and red And in notes from the blackbird's bill, When I laid me down on a bank by the water's edge: In the glowing shadow I lay. My very body was drenched in a speechless joy Whose cause I could not say. The sky was poured in singing rivers of blue; The ripple danced in sight; Close to the marge was a coloured pebble; it burned Amid kisses of liquid light. Like a hurry of little flames the tremble of gleams Shivered up through the leaves and was gone. Like a shaking of heavenly bells was the sound of the leaves In the tower of branches blown. And odours wandering each from its honeyed haunt Over the air stole, Like memories out of a world before the world, Seeking the private soul. But I knew not where my soul was: in that hour Neither time nor place it knew! It was trembling high in the topmost blossom that drank Of the glory of airy blue; It was dark in the root that sucked of the plenteous earth; It was lovely flames of fire; It was water that murmured round and around the world; It was poured in the sun's desire. Not the bird, but the bird's bright, wayward swiftness; Not the flowers in magic throng, But the shooting, the breathing and the perfumed breaking; Not the singer it was, but the song. I touched the flesh of my body, and it was strange. It seemed that my spirit knew It was I no more; yet the earth and the sky answered And cried aloud, It is you! Then into my blood the word of my being thrilled, (Not a nerve but aware)—It is I! Yet I could not tell my thought from the green of the grass, My bliss from the blue of the sky Overbrimmed, overflowing, I rose like one who has drunk Of a radiance keener than wine. I stood on the marvellous earth, and felt my blood As the stream of a power divine. Laughter of children afar on the air came to me And touched me softly home. There were tears in me like trembling dew; I knew not Where they had stolen from. Who is not my brother, and who is not my sister? O wonder of human eyes, Have I passed you by, nor perceived how luminous in you All infinity lies? Love opened my eyes and opened my ears; not one, But his soul is as mine is to me! I heard like a ripple around the world breaking The voices of children in glee; I saw the beauty, secret as starlit wells, Treasured in the bosoms of the old. I heard like the whisper of leaf to leaf in the nightwind Hopes that the tongue never told. Was it the grass that quivered about me? I felt Not that, but the hearts beating Close to my own, unnumbered as blades of the grass, And the dead in the quick heart meeting; And I knew the dreams of wandering sorrow and joy Breathed in the sleep of the night From the other side of the earth, that for me was glowing To the round horizon's light; The earth that moves through the light and the dark for ever, As a dancer moves among The maze of her sister stars, with a silent speed In a dance that is always young: And the heart of my body knew that it shared in all; It was there, not alone nor afraid. It throbbed in the life that can never be destroyed, In the things Time never made. FOR MERCY, COURAGE, KINDNESS, MIRTH For Mercy, Courage, Kindness, Mirth, There is no measure upon earth. Nay, they wither, root and stem, If an end be set to them. Overbrim and overflow If your own heart you would know. For the spirit, born to bless, Lives but in its own excess. WIND AT MIDNIGHT Naked night; black elms, pallid and streaming sky! Alone with the passion of the Wind, In a hollow of stormy sound lost and alone am I, On beaten earth a lost, unmated mind, Marvelling at the stars, few, strange, and bright, That all this dark assault of surging air, Wrenching the rooted wood, hunting the cloud of night, As if it would tear all and nothing spare, Leaves supreme in the height. Against what laws, what laws, what powers invisible, Unsought yet always found, Cries this dumb passion, strains this wrestle of wild will, With tiger-leaps that seem to shake the ground? Is it the baffled, homeless, rebel wind's crying Or storm from a profounder passion wrung? Ah, heart of man, is it you, the old powers defying, By far desires and terrible beauty stung, Broken on laws unseen, in a starry world dying Ignorant, tameless, young? SURRENDER Pale was the early day, Fog-white the winter air, When up a hill-side bare, Roughened with rimy grass, I took my thoughtless way. As my feet strayed uphill I felt the blank cloud float Past, and bedew my coat. At unawares I found A gate, and there stood still. And on a sudden behold, Above, the virgin blue, Blue, bathing my heart through! A shock of blueness bright Pierced with an eye of gold. And there uprising tall From mist to warm sapphire, Straight up like windless fire, A poplar stood alone, White, dream-fresh, virginal. Rime robed her, pure as snow. O white was never white As this which thrilled my sight. I stood still in the mist, Dazzled, entranced, aglow. For in a dazzling drift The rime rained down, it gleamed, It shivered soft, it streamed, Radiant as tears of joy When the heart gives all its gift. Alone in the still, still air To the divine lone height Of blue this poplar white Like virgin ecstasy Stript all her beauty bare. NOTHING IS ENOUGH Nothing is enough! No, though our all be spent— Heart's extremest love, Spirit's whole intent, All that nerve can feel, All that brain invent,— Still beyond appeal Will Divine Desire Yet more excellent Precious cost require Of this mortal stuff,— Never be content Till ourselves be fire. Nothing is enough! BEAUTY I think of a flower that no eye ever has seen, That springs in a solitary air. Is it no one's joy? It is beautiful as a queen Without a kingdom's care. We have built houses for Beauty, and costly shrines, And a throne in all men's view: But she was far on a hill where the morning shines And her steps were lost in the dew. PAIN Find me out a fortress, find Such a mind within the mind As can gather to its source All of life's inveterate force, Find the hard and secret cell In my body's citadel, Iron-ribbed from suck and drain Of the clutching monster, Pain— Pain, the formless alien will That seeks me out, that strives to drill Through shielding thought and barricade Of all the strength my will has made; That singles me and searches through The sharp sense I am narrowed to; And ever as the bond I strain Thrusts me home to flesh again, Estranging me from earth, to be One fierce throb of identity! Yet there's fibre in the mind I shall find, I shall find, To resist and to defy All the world that is not I. TREES ARE FOR LOVERS Trees are for lovers. A spirit has led them Where the young boughs meet And the green light hovers, And shadowy winds blow sweet. Trees spring to heaven! So their hearts would spring, So would they outpour All the heart discovers Of its own wild treasure Into speech, and sing Like the tree from its core Sweet words beyond measure Like leaves in the sun Dancing every one And weaving a fairy Cave of quivering rays And of shadows starry Where those lovers, drowned Each in the other's gaze, Lose all time, abound In their perfect giving; Give and never tire Of their fulness, still In the fresh leaves living One full song unsated Of the flower Desire And Delight the fruit; Love, that's mated. THE MEETING Faces of blank decorum, and bald heads And the drone of a voice saying what none denies; Words like cobwebs, scarcely stirred by a breath, Loosely hanging, gray in an unswept corner; Thoughts belonging to nobody, like old coats Cheaply borrowed out of a dead man's wardrobe. Over his spectacles looks the Chairman, blandly Solemn, exacting attention, nodding approval. I look on the floor and ponder the shaven planks,— Tall trees once, tossing aloft in the wild air; I watch the sun that falls upon oaken carvings, A gentle beam from millions of miles away: Hands and a chisel carved them,—at night the lips Of the carver blew the dust from his work and smiled. The chairs, so silent under the ponderous flesh,— Pleasure shaped them out of a brain's designing. The brass of the chandelier, the molten metal Streamed in the mould, conspired to friendly uses. I feel the spring of the trees and their old rejoicing, The touch of the warmth of hands that felt for beauty. Near and neighbourly are those shapes about me, Taking the light sweetly and saying nothing. Why is a voice, the only human assertion, Farther away than the suns of the astronomers? HOME-COMING From the howl of the wind As I opened the door And entered, the firelight Was soft on the floor. Mute each in their places Were table and chair, The white wall, the shadows, Awaiting me there. All was strange on a sudden! From the stillness a spell, A fear or a fancy, Across my heart fell. Were they waiting another To sit by the hearth? Was it I saw them newly, A stranger on earth? THE AUGUST WEEDS I wandered between woods On a grassy down, when still Clouds hung after rain Over hollow and hill; The blossom-time was over, The singing throats dumb, And the year's coloured ripeness Not yet come. And all at unawares, Surprising the stray sight, Ran straight into my heart Like a beam, delight. Negligent weeds ravelled The green edge of the copse, Whitely, dimly, sparkling With a million drops. And sudden fancy feigned What strange beauty would pass Did but a shiver of wind Tremble through the grass, Shaking the poised, round drops Spilled and softly rolled A-glitter from the ragworth's Roughened gold; From the rusted scarlet Of tall sorrel seed, And fretted tufts, frost-gray, Of the silver-weed, And from purple-downed thistle Towering dewy over Yellow-cupped spurge And the drenched, sweet clover. But all were motionless: Not one breath shed Those little pale pearls That an elf might thread Under a fading moon By an old thorn-tree For the witching throat Of Nimuë. SEEKING AND FINDING Thinking of shores that I shall never see, And things that I would know but am forbid By Time and briefness, treasuries locked from me In unknown tongue or human bosom hid, Knowing how unsure is all my knowledge, doled To sloven memory and to cheated sense, And to what majesty of stars I hold My little candle of experience In the vast night, in the untravelled night, I sigh and seek. And there is answer none But in the silence that sure pressure slight Of your heart beating close beside my own. O Love, Love, where in you is any bound? Fool I to seek, who have infinitely found. REMINISCENCE The rain was ending, and light Lifting the leaden skies. It shone upon ceiling and floor And dazzled a child's eyes. Pale after fever, a captive Apart from his schoolfellows, He stood at the high room's window With face to the pane pressed close, And beheld an immense glory Flooding with fire the drops Spilled on miraculous leaves Of the fresh green lime-tree tops. Washed gravel glittered red To a wall, and beyond it nine Tall limes in the old inn yard Rose over the tall inn sign. And voices arose from beneath Of boys from school set free, Racing and chasing each other With laughter and games and glee. To the boy at the high room-window, Gazing alone and apart, There came a wish without reason, A thought that shone through his heart. I'll choose this moment and keep it, He said to himself, for a vow, To remember for ever and ever As if it were always now. ANGERED REASON Angered Reason walked with me A street so squat, unshapen, bald, So blear-windowed and grimy-walled, So dismal-doored, it seemed to be The abortion of a mind that had Nor wit nor will to make, but left Its impotence in image, reft Of even the means of seeming glad. And there, like never-ripened fruit, Unsunned and starved, were human lives In joyless, neighbour-dreading hives Of care, with half their senses mute. It pressed on me, that patient street, It hurt me that it housed my kind: It was so abject and resigned And so deformed, I hated it. The stars that flowered above grew bright; The evening filled with wondrous blue; The lampshine glistened in the dew; The gliding trams were ships of light. And through my rebel heart there ran The want of things not bought or sold; The spirit free to make and mould; The naked glory of a man. And fevered I began to build A city, like the body, worth The natural happiness of earth, And with this folk its streets I filled, No more from widest joy exiled Nor helpless in a caging net. Suddenly by a lamp I met A woman carrying her child. I stopped the building of my dream: For there was all the future's book Written in that enfolding look, And there the never-ending theme, And there the builder of the strong City of men's desire; but there Also the shadow of the snare And the corruption and the wrong. Ah, now I doubted of my thought That could so easily perfect Wishes in dream, and raise the wrecked, And make all noble as it wrought. Those mother's eyes, absorbed, unknown, Had made my vision wan and thin. There was a harder world to win From flesh and blood than wood and stone. O now of those, life's prisoners, none, Soiled, soured, or hardened, but had speech To me of secret wonder; each Was once so wonderful to one! Yet she that bears the pang, and hears The first young cry and stills its want, And can with her vast hope enchant The promise of betraying years,— Who should have beauty's best but she To whom a son is given? That street Of life's denial and defeat Stood in my mind, accusing me. THE THINGS THAT GROW It was nothing but a little neglected garden, Laurel-screened, and hushed in a hot stillness; An old pear-tree, and flowers mingled with weeds. Yet as I came to it all unawares, it seemed Charged with mystery; and I stopped, intruding, Fearful of hurting that so absorbed stillness. For I was tingling with the wind's salty splendour, And still my senses moved with the keel's buoyance Out on the water, where strong light was shivered Into a dance dazzling as drops of flame. The rocking radiance and the winged sail's lifting And the noise of the rush of the water left behind Sang to my body of movement, victory, joy. But here the light was asleep, and green, green In a veined leaf it glowed among the shadows. A hollyhock rose to the sun and bathed its flowers Luminously clustered in the unmoving air; A butterfly lazily winked its gorgeous wings; Marigolds burned intently amid the grass; The ripening pears hung each with a rounded shadow: All beyond was drowned in the indolent blueness; And at my feet, like a word of an unknown tongue, Was the midnight-dark bloom of the delicate pansy. Suddenly these things awed my heart, as if here In perishing blossom and springing shoot were a power Greater than shipwrecking winds and all wild waters. THE NIGHT WALK The night wind over the great downs Streams along the sky. In the solitude of the hill-side There is only you and I. The night wind leaps and rushes Black in the trees that cry As if their travail echoed The world's eternal why? Clouds have buried the old moon. The sunk light cowers shy. In a world of stumbling and darkness There is only you and I. DOING AND MAKING I am weary of doing and dating The day with the thing to be done, This painful self translating To a language not my own. Give me to fashion a thing; Give me to shape and to mould; I have found out the song I can sing, I am happy, delivered, and bold. THE BATHER Water, frolic water! Drops in the dazzle of noon, drops divinely cold, Radiant down naked breast, down arm and thigh You run to my feet, shaken to shining grass, Betwixt the green blades, liquid gems, you lie. Water, careless water! Little miraculous mirrors Globing the glory of earth and sky, Lazy drops, vanishing in the sun's hot kisses, Drops caressingly rolled, You glide and suddenly fall like a falling star, Like a throb of delight you die. The pool beneath me glows In its own gloom asleep, Water, secret water! But all its quivering sparkles, a fairy mesh, Are showered about my sun-delighted flesh. And I wonder at the beauty of water, Simple and swift and shy, A slumber and escape, Anywhither yielding, A never-recovered shape, Laughter and loss in an instant's gleam to the eye! Water, vivid water! I feel the cool drops run Down me in the sun; And suddenly thrilling near In the stillness of noon is a vision of water swung In waves heavy and huge Out of a chaos shaped into shapes of fear Heedless of human cry, Drowning, ruining, endlessly crashed and returning,— A power, a terror! O cold, dancing drops, Is it the kiss of a danger in delight That makes you glow on the body of a man And the heart of a man reply? A GLIMPSE OF TIME In the shadow of a broken house, Down a deserted street, Propt walls, cold hearths, and phantom stairs, And the silence of dead feet— Locked wildly in one another's arms I saw two lovers meet. And over that hearthless house aghast Rose from the mind's abyss Lost stars and ruined, peering moons, Worlds overshadowing this,— Time's stony palace crumbled down Before that instant kiss. BEFORE SLEEP COMES Where do you float from, visions that shine ere sleep Subdues with leaden law The dancing fires of the brain?—In a shadowy land, As a king from a tower I saw. There came startled gazelles, beautifully leaping, Delicate-hoofed: they were gone, And the red pomegranate showered its petalled bloom On the glittering stream alone. I saw the dust on an Indian plain, and a grove Where pilgrims went in white: I saw the mountains, throned upon purple air, Remote in sculptured light. And I saw the broadening beams of the early sun On the pale Pacific melt, And naked fishermen, idly rocked in a boat; Their briny nets I smelt. I saw amid Asian deserts a bed of reeds, And a heron slowly rose To the cloud from wild reeds blown by a wind that came From a land no man yet knows. And I watched a tall ship gliding out of the mist By a snow-seamed iron cape. The smoky wraiths clung round her, but on she stemmed, Self-willed, a wing-bright shape. Then all fell dark. Yet still in a trance elate, And strange to myself I lay. Here was the black, soft stillness: but where was I? Far away, far away. NUMBERS Trefoil and Quatrefoil! What shaped those destinied small silent leaves Or numbered them under the soil? I lift my dazzled sight From grass to sky, From humming and hot perfume To scorching, quivering light,— Empty blue!—Why, As I bury my face afresh In a sunshot vivid gloom— Minute infinity's mesh, Where spearing side by side Smooth stalk and furred uplift Their luminous green secrets from the grass, Tower to a bud and delicately divide— Do I think of the things unthought Before man was? Bodiless Numbers! When there was none to explore Your winding labyrinths occult, None to delve your ore Of strange virtue, or do Your magical business, you Were there, never old nor new, Veined in the world and alive: Before the planets, Seven; Before these fingers, Five! You that are globed and single, Crystal virgins, and you that part, Melt, and again mingle! We have hoisted sail in the night On the oceans that you chart: Dark winds carry us onward, on; But you are there before us, silent Answers, Beyond the bounds of the sun. You body yourselves in the stars, inscrutable dancers, Native where we are none. O inhuman Numbers! All things change and glide, Corrupt and crumble, suffer wreck and decay, But, obstinate dark Integrities, you abide, And obey but them who obey. All things else are dyed In the colours of man's desire: But you no bribe nor prayer Avails to soften or sway. Nothing of me you share, Yet I cannot think you away. And if I seek to escape you, still you are there, Stronger than caging pillars of iron, Not to be passed, in an air Where human wish and word Fall like a frozen bird. Music asleep In pulses of sound, in the waves! Hidden runes rubbed bright! Dizzy ladders of thought in the night! Are you masters or slaves— Subtlest of man's slaves— Shadowy Numbers? In a vision I saw Old vulture Time, feeding On the flesh of the world; I saw The home of our use outdated— Seasons of fruiting and seeding Withered, and hunger and thirst Dead, with all they fed on: Till at last, when Time was sated, Only you persisted, Dædal Numbers, sole and same, Invisible skeleton frame Of the peopled earth we tread on— Last, as first. Because naught can avail To wound or to tarnish you; Because you are neither sold nor bought, Because you have not the power to fail But live beyond our furthest thought, Strange Numbers, of infinite clue Beyond fear, beyond ruth, You strengthen also me To be in my own truth. THE TWO DESIRES What is the spirit's desire, Sprung, springing, singing, Fountain-fresh, rainbowed over with lights that awaken The inner dishevelled crystal, starrily shaken To sevenfold changes of fire? Youth in its wonder aflower, Up to the sun swinging, A March daffodil, braves the bright wind's cold— Sensitive silken softness, yet how bold Against the cold snow-flurry and sleet shower! Because it seeks—what mark Beyond the tower of the lark Who sees the dawn from the dark? Only itself to unfold, Expand, outpour, be told, All, all to utter,— Delicate thought's moth-flutter, And hope's proud-sweeping voyage of wings sky-reaping; To soar and to explore In the midst of this mind-soiling Earth-medley, and flesh-toiling Cares, betrayal, and pain's returning sting; Still to spring, still to sing, Flame and flower of the mind, Seeking bliss in this,— Itself, itself to find. What is the spirit's desire? —Comes Experience after, Experience and Comparison, mockers old. Trail of a tarnishing cloud is heavily rolled, And, harsher than shadow or cold, Pitiless light searches the shallows of laughter For terrible truth in the world rock-seated. Yet not because shadow-fearing or world-defeated But natively in its own unprompted sort, Because of desire profounder than desire, O now where aims the spirit? Higher, higher Than ever flight up-carried it! Now that aim Is a greatness greater than hero's name and fame, A beauty passionate more than flesh can support, Divine greatness, divine beauty, a pain Appeasing all pains; flying not blight or bruise, But seeking its own afar-conceived resort, The spirit is only fain Itself to lose, Lose, lose. WALNUT-LEAF SCENT In the high leaves of a walnut, On the very topmost boughs, A boy that climbed the branching bole His cradled limbs would house. On the airy bed that rocked him Long, idle hours he'd lie Alone with white clouds sailing The warm blue of the sky. I remember not what his dreams were; But the scent of a leaf's enough To house me higher than those high boughs In a youth he knew not of, In a light that no day brings now But none can spoil or smutch, A magic that I felt not then And only now I touch. COMMERCIAL Gross, with protruding ears, Sleek hair, brisk glance, fleshy and yet alert, Red, full, and satisfied, Cased in obtuseness confident not to be hurt, He sits at a little table In the crowded, congenial glare and noise, jingling Coins in his pocket; sips His glass, with hard eye impudently singling A woman here and there:— Women and men, they are all priced in his thought, All commodities staked In the market, sooner or later sold and bought. “Were I he,” you are thinking, You with the dreamer's forehead and pure eyes, “What should I lose?—All, All that is worth the striving for, all my prize; “All the truth of me, all Life that is wonder, pity and fear, requiring Utter joy, utter pain, From the heart that the infinite hurts with deep desiring. “Why is it I am not he? Chance? The grace of God? The mystery's plan? He, too, is human stuff, A kneading of the old, brotherly slime of man. “Am I a lover of men, And turn abhorring as from fat slug or snake? Lives obstinate in me too Something the power of angels could not unmake?” O self-questioner! None Unlocks your answer. Steadily look, nor flinch. This belongs to your kind, And knows its aim, and fails not itself at a pinch. It is here in the world and works, Not done with yet.—Up, then, let the test be tried! Dare your uttermost, be Completely, and of your own, like him, be justified. THE TAMARISK HEDGE I know that there are slumbrous woods beyond On islands of white marges, where the tide Floods upward, blue as a kingfisher's wing, And sails, like wishes of a reverie, Shine to the wind that fills them, far inland. I know that there are harbours in the hills Amid those verdurous, smooth bosom-folds, Found by the idle sunbeams for their sleep. But it contents me to see nothing more Than liquid blue of the invisible wind Flowing and glowing through the tamarisk That waves upon this wild deserted bank; And I lie warm on the short, sandy turf Lulled in bright noise of the returning sea. O plumy Tamarisk, tossing your green hair In the wind's radiant stream, as if I had lent Your fibres all my senses of delight, Why does it so enchant me to have nothing, And drink long draughts of sky where nothing is, And tremble to the glory of an hour That passes out of nothing into nothing? SHABBY HOUSE-WALL Shabby house-wall Of bricks once yellow, Dingied with city grime, Dusty and sallow, The high sun, glorying In clear gold, edges Your crumbled mortar's Luminous ledges. You glow with a touch From the pure sky. And suddenly all Is new to the eye. I see you as labour's Rough fruit and homely, Raised morning by morning To an order comely; Labour of hands long dead, Living, when all's at rest, After the dark has come And the light gone West. EVENING RAIN What is lovelier than rain that lingers Falling through the western light? The light that's red between my fingers Bathes infinite heaven's remotest height. Whither will the cloud its darkness carry Whose trembling drops about me spill? Two worlds, of shadow and splendour, marry: I stand between them rapt and still. ON THE HILLS Drinking wide, sunny wind, Hand within hand, We look from hill to hill Of our own land. Hand within hand, we remember Without speech, And hour upon hour comes about us; We number them each. O little far clouds that swim In the round of blue, Are you bringing those hours again, Shining in you? You melt into air, drop on earth, Sucked up in the light, And again you appear, in the blue You are born, you are bright, As those hours live in us, nay beyond; When we die, they shall still Lift our hearts up, as now we uplift Our hearts on the hill. THE HOUSE THAT WAS Of the old house, only a few, crumbled Courses of brick, smothered in nettle and dock, Or a shaped stone lying mossy where it tumbled! Sprawling bramble and saucy thistle mock What once was fire-lit floor and private charm, Whence, seen in a windowed picture, were hills fading At night, and all was memory-coloured and warm, And voices talked, secure of the wind's invading. Of the old garden, only a stray shining Of daffodil flames among April's cuckoo-flowers Or clustered aconite, mixt with weeds entwining! But, dark and lofty, a royal cedar towers By homelier thorns; and whether the rain drifts Or sun scorches, he holds the downs in ken, The western vales; his branchy tiers he lifts, Older than many a generation of men. AWAKENING Out of first sleep as they awoke The moon had stolen upon her face. It seemed that they had opened eyes New on another world and place. The eyes of each the other sought Wondering; no sound was in the night. On them the very soul of peace Gazed in that spiritual light. Beyond the reign of hurt and pain, Beyond the boundaries of death, Each seemed with their awaking sighs To breathe at last their native breath. FLAME AND SNOW The bare branches rose against the gray sky. Under them, freshly fallen, snow shone to the eye. Up the hill-slope, over the brow it shone, Spreading an immaterial beauty to tread upon. In the elbow of black boughs it clung, nested white, And smooth below it slept in the solitude of its light. It was deep to the knee in the hollow; there in a stump of wood I struck my bill-hook, warm to the fingers' blood, and stood, Pausing, and breathed and listened: all the air around Was filled with busy strokes and ringing of clean sound, And now and again a crack and a slow rending, to tell When a tree heavily tottered and swift with a crash fell. I smelt the woody smell of smoke from the fire, now Beginning to spurt from frayed bracken and torn bough In the lee of a drift, fed from our long morning toil And sending smart to the eyes the smoke in a blue coil. I lopped the twigs from a fresh-cut pole and tossed it aside To the stakes heaped beyond me, and made a plunging stride, And gathered twines of bramble and dead hazel sticks And a faggot of twisted thorn with snow lumped in the pricks, And piled the smoulder high. Soon a blaze tore Up through hissing boughs and shrivelling leaves, from a core Of quivering crimson; soon the heat burst and revelled, And apparitions of little airy flames dishevelled Gleamed and vanished, a lost flight as of elfin wings, Trembling aloft to the wild music that Fire sings Dancing alive from nothing, lovely and mad. And still The snow, pale as a dream, slept on the old hill, Softly fallen and strange. Which made me more to glow, Beauty of young flames, or wonder of young snow? COMPANIONS The bread that's broken when we eat together Tastes sweet. A sunbeam stealing to your hand Seems as if spilled from something brimming over Within me, wanting no word, or itself The word I wanted! Find we not our own Language in winds, fresh from a golden place, When breasting the high down at last we turn To each other, bright with rapturous escape, And the hills sing together, like our hearts, Lost in the light! Between us, as we walk Green roadsides, under homely hedgerow elms Of summer leaf, silences are as water Smooth for the sail and shining to the verge, But intimate as a hand's touch when we pace Long crowded pavements amber-lamped in dusk That holds its dark breath over the gay talk, Bright eyes, and grief buried in moving sound. There is a secret colour that has dyed The world within our hearts: none knows it else, No more than that which thickens the flushed light Deep in the foxglove's honey-throat; it is there In the midst of light speech and forgetfulness, In the empty house of absence, where the walls Echo other voices; it is in the midst Of the unsaid fears the mind plots forts against, In the dragging thought and drizzle of blank care, The daily doing of what must be done; Then suddenly it glows and bathes us like the sun. OUR TREE HAS FLOWERS We have planted a tree, And behold, it has flowers. How lovely their joy! Yet they know not of ours, Who have shared in dull cares And the sharpness of pain Yet feel in our kisses The first kiss again, And with hand clasped in hand We turn and we see The sweet laughing flowers On our own fair tree. NAKED Pride is the untrue mask, Shame is a cloak that clings, Tenderness oft is a trammelling veil Because of truth that stings. O to be stript, and to use All one's soul entire! To be seen in the light, to be known for one's own, To abound in the beauty of desire! As the young man casts his clothes, And, freed to the living air, Runs down the radiant ocean-sands With singing body bare. THE MOMENT Lose me, full, full moment, Like a ripple round, Widening into worlds Beyond earth's bound. I was walking a gray road Dulled to an old aim: Now I seek nothing, Now I have no name. How came you to me, Opening timeless skies Like a heaven within me That is all sunrise? SILENCES IN THE MIND Silences in the mind, the haunting Silences, Silences daunting, Chill as a cavern's air, immuring hollow gloom Yet inly luring Like springs that ooze there, glidings from the stone: What strange, dark tidings You brim with! First, the doubted certainties, Then fancies routed By a spectral whisper from unstable worlds That turns to fable Accepted hope and fever of desires; A whispered Never, Out of a vapour clothing from afar All things in Nothing. THE THISTLE In a patch of baked earth At the crumbled cliff's brink, Where the parching of August Has cracked a long chink, Against the blue void Of still sea and sky Stands single a thistle, Tall, tarnished, and dry. Frayed leaves, spotted brown, Head hoary and torn, Was ever a weed Upon earth so forlorn, So solemnly gazed on By the sun in his sheen That prints in long shadow Its raggedness lean? From the sky comes no laughter, From earth not a moan. Erect stands the thistle, Its seeds abroad blown. MY BOAT SWINGS OUT AND BACK My boat swings out and back, Moored among mint and rush. The river's ruffled speed Laughs in the white wind's track. My idle fingers crush A crinkled, scented reed. Who needs his fate provoke? A spirit in all things flows, And I with them flow too, Content to eye long boughs Of silvering willow stroke Slowly the summer blue. THE LURE The long road lures across the hill, Divides the brown fields and the green, And curves, and dips, and climbing still Gleams over into lands unseen. I think what valleys far more fair Than ours, the road runs on to meet. The light falls wild and happy there. What shadowy doubt delays my feet? Oh, one day, one day, I shall go Whither the road runs out of sight, And find, whatever winds may blow, An inn at falling of the night. THE APPLE BOUGHS Round apples, burning upon the apple boughs, As the evening flush withdraws, Perfect and satiate, earth's completed vows, In a stillness nothing flaws, You burn in the branching golden green, you float In humid blue immersed, Strange as if gleaming out of an air remote Where unknown tongues conversed. Coloured and orbed by the hours, in motionless poise, You are timed, and rounded, and still: But in me is the want that springs, creates, destroys, The want no hours fulfil. Stirred but a wing, stole but a tremor of light From the cloud, and my heart were aware That its will is to be with the spirit whose joy is flight; I have tasted a timeless air. Spiritual laughter promises all things free, The heart has a heaven to spend. Where the mind imagines its own, perfection to me Is a prison, a date, and an end. THE EYES OF YOUTH Time buys no wisdom like the eyes of youth, Though youth itself be blinded with delight, As a buoyant swimmer by the bursting spray Of the resplendent surge, and know not yet The marvel of its own heart's vision, blurred By lovely follies dancing in the sun. I heard a skylark scaling the spring air As slow I climbed the misty, rough hill-side. He poured the wordless wonder of his joy Into the empty sky: was never word Of human language held a joy so pure; But it was I who knew it! Though my feet Stayed on the plodded earth and in the mist, Yet I could breathe, float, mount and sing with him, The unweariable singer; I could bathe In the beyond of blue, and know the round Of sea beneath me, and the sun above. He gave of what he knew not, soaring throat! HOLIDAY Through Ebblesborne and Broad-Chalke The narrow river runs, Dimples with dark November rains, Flashes in April suns. But give me days of rosy June And on warm grass to lie And watch, bright over long green weed, Quick water wimple by. Blue swallows, arrowing up and down, Cool trout that glide and dart, Lend me their happy bodies For the fancies of my heart. But you, clear stream, that murmur One music all day long, I wish my idle fancy Sang half so sweet a song. ADVERSARIES Who are these that meet At random in the street? Adversaries! Yet they Make no sign nor stay. Neither he nor she Knows what those Powers be That bodied in them go Among the peopled flow, One toward the dusk and one Toward the Western sun. Secret eyes turn to her, And bosoms throb astir, As if a perfume blew And made the evening new. Lissom with budding breast, She steps toward the bright West, An airy-footed shape! Above the neck's young nape Springs wonderful her hair. The round throat lifts in air The flower that is her head. Her lips are Peril's red; Her eyes a shy surprise, Shedding soft cruelties. Of what will was she wrought, Vivid, without a thought? Fragrance of all that's young And delicately sprung Is round her like a lure Voluptuously pure;— Eternal soul of sense, The moment's quintessence! Of what will was she made, With those fine lashes laid Upon her bloom? She comes From the wild Earth, that hums With summer in the mead, Glutting the flower-cups' greed Of sunlight; ill to tame As Hunger, Thirst or Flame. But he that's striding East Regards not her the least. His thought is far away, Circling the end of day. Though young, the restless mind, Moulding the flesh, has signed His features; and his gaze, Absented in retreat From all this human street, Holds musings that begin To sharpen cheek and chin. What speculation now Beneath that ardent brow Braves what it sees?—Among Blind worlds, this planet swung Like an old toy, a spark In the gigantic dark, A mote of dust alive, Where millions meanly strive— For what? If Thought alone Keeps man upon his throne Of courage, to outface The Gorgon mask of Space, What wills it with this house Of flesh, that loves to drowse And take the hours of sense For sweetness and defence,— Of flesh that is but clay For Thought to sift away Like powder of idle sand Within the crumbling hand? Two Cruelties are these, And two Defiances. Yet though they be apart As East and West, the heart Of man is twined in each. Of them he makes his speech, His torment and delight, His songs, his tears, his height Of wisdom, his despair. Though both his being tear, He knows not which to choose Nor which he'd harder lose. THE SEVEN ISLES I dream of western waters, and of the Seven Isles, And of mornings when they appear Flowering out of the mist on a sea of smiles, Warm and familiar and near. Then O how changed! fugitive, faint, remote; In another world than ours, Vanishing apparitions, they seemed to float; Shadows of shadowy powers. Effaced, at last, as if they had never been! Drowned in the empty bay. On solitary water was nothing to be seen But a sail, pale on the gray. And I wonder, O Isles, reappearing and lost without sign In the solitude of the seas, Are the songs of the Immortals more divine Or their magical silences? THE FULL HEART If I could sing the song of her Who makes my heart to sing; If I could catch the words to match Its secret blossoming; My song should be a heaven of sound Thrilled through a single note,— The world of light that's infinite In one flower's honey-throat! A fountain diamonded in air, Earth-blessing dews at night, A dancing child, flames lovely-wild, Should not so much delight. But where I most have theme to boast I stammer in my speech; The full heart shames my faltering art With music past its reach. THE CATHEDRAL PORCH Towering, towering up to the noon-blaze, Up to the hot blue, up to blinding gold, Pillar and pinnacle, arch and corbel, scrolled, Flowered and tendrilled, soar, aspire and raise The giant porch, with kings and prophets old High in their niches, like one shout of praise, From earth to heaven.—In shadow of the door Cringeing, a beggar stands; He holds out abject hands; His lips for pity and alms mechanically implore. Splendour of air and the bright splintered beam Carve all afresh in strong reverberate glow As if even now the passionate master-blow Struck from the stone the shapes of beauty's dream. Can a mere hand ever have fashioned so Desire's adventure, god-like force, supreme Sky-scaling joy?—The beggar's toneless drone Comes from his laughterless Accepted wretchedness As from a long-dried well, where off-cast clutter's thrown. Prophet and saint and kingly king, whose eyes, Flashing authority, gaze and awe, you came From wombs of flesh, though now enthroned in fame. A mother heard the helpless wailing cries Of voices that have won the world's acclaim By wisdom, suffering, truth. August you rise Above this wreck, by whom the children run Careless with dancing limb, And laugh, and mock at him; And beggar, children, towering porch are equal in the sun. From the opened door bursts upon glorious wings Music: the shadowy silence moves with sound That overflows and rolls returning round. As if to itself, the pillared grandeur sings Of deeper than all thought has ever found, Of richer than the heart's imaginings, Of higher than all hope has dared to see. Like comment of a crow, Dulled, reiterate, slow, The human plaint croaks answer: Vanity! look on me! Who made the stark unfeatured quarry-block Live in those song-like pillars? And who smote The ancient silence into note on note Melodious as the river from the rock? Out of the heart of man such splendours float As make his vileness and his misery mock The prisoned soul: which shall bespeak him more, Grandeur of stone and sound, Or fawning abject, bound To his abasement, close as to a dungeon floor? Sunken eyes, craving hands, defeated shape, Whom to look on so humbles, you appear But as the avoided husk, shrivelled and sere, Cast by the spirit that springs up to escape To its own reality and radiance there For ever fresh as young bloom on a grape, Triumphing to be human, yet to win An amplitude beyond Dull care and fancy fond, And breathe the light that man was born to glory in. Yet littleness, and envy, and obscure pain Were mortised into that magnificence! Trading his wretchedness for pity's pence, Though this poor ruin from the depth complain, Slave to his self-lamenting impotence, Nor can his proud humanity regain; O Wonder of Man, in his indignity, Forfeit, disgrace, and rue, Shares he not still in you? Did not man sink so low, could he aspire so high? UNSATED MEMORY Emerging from deep sleep my eyes unseal To a pursuing strangeness. O to be Where but a moment past I was, though where The place, the time I know not, only feel Far from this banished and so shrunken me, Struck conscious to the alien dawn's blank peer! Between two worlds, homeless, I doubt of both, Knowing only that I seemed possessing realms And now have nothing. In this glimmering cave Of daylight, whither I return so loath, The emptiness of silence overwhelms;— Still, vision-haunted, like the blind, I crave. For splendour beats along my blood in gleams As of a skyey largeness closed and lost, That memory torments itself to clutch, Hungering unsated for that light of dreams Pursued down shadowy paths that foil, exhaust, And lose me in a cloud I cannot touch. Fixed as in frost the motionless dim shape Of each accustomed thing about my bed Is like an enmity at watch for stale Habit to repossess me past escape. In the dead light all seems apart and dead, Yet menaces. The ticked hour is my jail. Yet I had sense as of a forge whose blast Could fuse this stark world into glorious flow Of young power streaming irresistible, And I, dilated, roamed a region vast, Feasting in vision, with a soul aglow, And Time a steed to pace or race at will. Where is that world that I am fallen from? Look, as a sea-weed left at ebb to pine Hueless and shrunken, that had liberty To wander sparkle-fresh in its own foam, Trailing its rosy hair in the long brine, So am I cast up; from what haunted sea? An ocean of the mind, without access Save in the labyrinths of sleep, a main Deep with the memory of all memories, Thoughts, and imaginations numberless That ever lodged in the brief-living brain, Washing our sun-lit ignorance: was it this? Then miserable I, that have but sucked Dull oozings, vanished into vaporous dew, From springs that custom closes like a stone And leaden fear and clayey doubt obstruct. Heir of the earth's youth and of all it knew, What am I but a vessel charged with oblivion? Ah, surely I was rather native there Where all desires were lovely, and the power Of Time irrevocably creeping sure Was uncreated, than in this numb air Of mapped days and of hour pursuing hour, Endless impediment and forfeiture. O we go shrouded from ourselves, and hide The soul from its own splendour, and encrust The virgin sense with thinking. Then some chance Moment reveals us: we are deified, Feeling and seeing; gold gleams from the rust; And, marvelling at our lost inheritance, We breathe the air of beauty; we regale The mind with innocence; joy has no stint; And we are chartered for the world's wide sea, Reason the rudder, not the sky-filled sail.— Still clings about us some imputing hint Of strangeness, even in self-captivity. Before me comes a vision of the old, With dear experience sunken in their eyes And furrowed on their faces; scarce a spark Betrays the quick fire that once made them bold. All their strength's only for that enterprise Which takes them soon into the engulfing dark. I think of old ships stranded, how they stir The mind to see their beauty in its decay. For they, unmemoried and mute, have been Companions of the wild winds without fear, And carried far adventure, who shall say Into what glories we have never seen? THE WOOD'S ENTRY So old is the wood, so old, Old as Fear. Wrinkled roots; great stems; hushed leaves; No sound near. Shadows retreat into shadow, Deepening, crossed. Burning light singles a low leaf, a bough, Far within, lost. GOBLINS The night is holy and haunted, Asleep in a vale of June. Stillness and earth-smell mingle With the beams' unearthly boon.— Yet a terror is fallen upon me From the other side of the moon. If it be Truth that's hidden Upon that other side, Unseen, unguessed of any, Waiting to be descried?... Without shadow or footstep, Goblins by me glide. The mellow moon, entrancing An English meadow here, Silvers the old farm roofs below And dewy grasses near. But the world her far side faces? I think of it, and fear. If not man's ancient terror, Bribed with long sacrifice, If not old ignorance, whose hope Would truth to itself entice— If reason be the goblin That thrills my blood to ice? The bean-blossom is breathing From fields in glimmer spread; A rose hangs black on the amber air... But I am lured and led To an outer vast apartness Beyond man's hope or dread. I look down upon me and mine As with translated eyes, My struggle in rapture and anguish But noted like a fly's, My world at stake, my heaven and hell Small as a beetle's prize. Busy in deep-sea dungeons, Great mouths of fishes blind; Blind wheel of planet on planet In gulfs no thought can find; The proud black stare of a falcon, Without a thought behind, Possess me, dispossess me: They mock me not, they are. The worlds are all a web that's hung Beyond conception far, That a gorged and hairy spider Spins in the central star. Ferocity of begetting; Prowling hunger's maw, Fury of teeth and hot-spilt blood, Cold pounce and tearing claw, Laughterless lust, the swarm and spawn That one another gnaw; A race to death, a frenzy Rushing into the night, A rage of life, a riot, Seen in a moment's light, And Death the wild pursuer Close on that fever-flight! I see it all in vision, I see with murdered sense Of neither good nor evil, Nor make a fool's pretence. I share, I too, that hunted And horrible innocence. Cruelty's matched with courage. Not that a power should thrive Which twists its poison-tendrils In all that is alive; Nor that with those fell doings My fate be to connive; Not this the ulterior terror That has the goblin grin, But that the ignorant stare of space Be the end as the origin,— This glorious palace of the mind A cave that tumbles in, And reason mocked by reason Be all the goal to win. INITIATION The wind has fal'n asleep; the bough that tost Is quiet; the warm sun's gone; the wide light Sinks and is almost lost; Yet the April day glows on within my mind Happy as the white buds in the blue air, A thousand buds that shone on waves of wind. Now evening leads me wooingly apart. The young wood draws me down these shelving ways Deeper, as if it drew me to its heart. What stills my spirit? What awaits me here? So motionless the budded hazels spring, So shadowy and so near! My feet make not a sound upon this moss,— Greenest gloom, scented with cold primroses. A ripple, shy as almost to be mute, Secretly wanders among further trees; Else the clear evening brims with loneliness, With stillness luminous and absolute. The pause between sunsetting and moonrise Exhales a strangeness. It melts out in dream The experience of the wise. This purity of sharpened sweet spring smells Comes like a memory lost since I was born. My own heart changes into mystery! There is some presence nears through all these spells Out of the darkened bosom of the earth: Not I the leaf, but the leaf touches me. Who seeks me? What shy lover, whose approach Makes spiritual the white flowers on the thorn? Who seems to breathe up round me,—perfume strange!— June and its bloom unborn? Shy as a virgin passion is the spring! I could have Time cease now, so there should live This blossom in the stillness of my heart,— Earth's earth, yet immaterial as a sense Enriched to understand, love, hope, forgive. Now, now, if ever, could the spirit catch, Beyond the ear's range, thrills of airy sound. I tremble, as at the lifting of a latch. Am I not found? This magical clear moment in the dusk Is like a crystal dewy-brimming bowl Imperilled upon lifting hands: I dread The breathing of the shadow that shall spill This wonder, and with it my very soul. A dead bough cracks under my foot. The charm Breaks; I am I now, in a gloom aware Of furtive, flitting wing, and hunted eyes, And furry feet a-scare. Fear, it is fear exiles us each apart; We are all bound and prisoned in our fear; From the dark shadow of our own selves we flee. Ah, but that moment, open-eyed, erect, I had stept out of all fear, and was free. How sweet it was in youth's shy giving-time Finding the sudden friend, whose thoughts ran out With yours in natural chime; Who knew, before speech, what the lips would tell! No need to excuse, to hide or to defend From him, in whom your dearest thought shone new And not a fancy stirred for him in vain. So was it, as with a so perfect friend, In that rare moment I have lost again. But lo, a whiteness risen beyond the hill: The moon-dawn! A late bird sings somewhere; hark The long, low, loitering trill! Like water-drops it falls into the dark. The earth-sweetness holds me in its fragrant mesh. Oh, though I know that I am bound afar, Yet, where the grass is, there I also grew. Blood knows more than the brain. Am I perhaps Most true to earth when I seem most untrue? THE CHILDREN DANCING Away, sad thoughts, and teasing Perplexities, away! Let other blood go freezing, We will be wise and gay. For here is all heart-easing, An ecstasy at play. The children dancing, dancing, Light upon happy feet, Both eye and heart entrancing Mingle, escape and meet; Come joyous-eyed advancing Or floatingly retreat. Now slow, now swifter treading Their paces timed and true, An instant poised, then threading A maze of printless clue, Their motions smoothly wedding To melody anew, They sway in chime, and scatter In looping circles; they Are Music's airy matter, And their feet move, the way The raindrops shine and patter On tossing flowers in May. As if those flowers were singing For joy of the clean air, As if you saw them springing To dance the breeze, so fair The lissom bodies swinging, So light the flung-back hair. And through the mind enchanted A happy river goes By its own young carol haunted And bringing where it flows What all the world has wanted And who in this world knows? THE WHARF ON THAMES-SIDE: WINTER DAWN Day begins cold and misty on soiled snow That frost has ridged and crusted. Sound of steps Comes, then a shape emerges from the mist Without haste, trudging tracks the feet know well, With his breath white upon the air before him, To old work. Over the river hangs a crane At the wharf's edge. Scarved, wheezing, buttoned up, The stubble-bearded crane-man eyes the tide Ruckling against moored barges under the bridge, Considers the blank moon, the obstinate frost, Swings arms and beats them on his breast for warmth, And to his engine-cabin disappears. Full, fast, impetuous the tide floods up Thames, And the solitary morning steals abroad Over a million roofs, intensely still And distant in a dark sleep. For whose joy Was it, the February moon all night Beamed silence, like the healing of all noise, And beauty, like compassion, upon mean Litter of energy and trading toil,— Cinder-heaps, sacks, tarpaulins, and stale straw; Empty and full trucks; rails; and rows of carts, Shafts tilted backwards; musty railway-arch, Dingy brick wall, huddled slate roofs? It shone On the clean snow and the fouled; touches of light Mysterious as a dreamer's smile! For whom Rose before dawn the spiritual pale mist, When imperceptibly the hue of the air Was altered, and the dwindled beamless moon Looked like an exiled ghost; till opposite The vapour flushed to airy rose, and dawn Made the first long faint shadows? Now the smoke Begins to go up from those chimnied roofs Across the water. Trains with hissing speed And frosty flashes cross the shaken bridge, Filled each with faces, eager and uneager, Tired and fresh, young and old; bound for the desk, The stool, the counter—threads in the roaring loom Of London. What thoughts have they in their eyes That idly fall on the familiar river This passive moment before toil usurps Hand and brain? Each a separate-memoried world Of scheme and fancy, of dreads and urgent hopes, Hungers and solaces! But which keeps not A private corner deep in heart or mind Where dwells what no one else knows? And they pass Nameless, in thousands, with their mysteries, by us. Slowly the city is waking in all its streets, But dark, impetuous, silent, full, up Thames The tide comes, like a lover to his own; Comes like a lover, as if it sought to pour Secrets to its listener, of vast night, and the old Bright moon-lit oceans; of wild breaths of brine; Of tall ships that it swung to an anchorage In the misty dawn, and wanderers far away On the outer seas among adventurous isles Whose names are homely here. As if the blood Of this our race poured back upon its heart, Drawn by that moon of pale farewell, it comes Brimming and buoyant, with an eager ripple Against the black-stemmed barges, and swift swirl Of sucking eddies by stone piers, and sound Like laughter along the grimed wall of the wharf. A great horse, tugging at a truck, stamps hoofs Upon the frozen ground. A man beside him Shouts or is silent. Labourers here and there Deliberately, in habit's motion, take Each his work: from the barges lighter-men Call, and the crane moves, rattling in its iron. It is plain day. Still the up-streaming tide Pours its swift secret, and the fading moon Lingers aloft. But now the wakened wharf, Stirred from its numbness, the bright rails, the trucks With snow upon them, and the hoisting crane, Are touched with all the difference of mankind; And the river whispering out of the travelled seas Of foreign ships and countries, comes to them With a familiar usage; each appears As a faculty of the morning, that begins Once more the inter-threaded toil of men. THE DREAM HOUSE Often we talk of the house that we will build For airier and less jostled days than these We chafe in, and send Fancy roaming wide Down western valleys with a choosing eye To hover upon this nook or on that, And let the mind, like fingers pressing clay, Shape and reshape the mould of an old desire, Spur jogging Time, conjure slow years to days, Until tall trees, like those far fabled walls, Rise visibly to the mind's music. Here We scoop a terrace under hanging woods Upon the generous slope of a green hill That gazes over alluring distances; Listen to our merry children at their play, And see the shadow lengthen from our roof On plots of garden. Fancy, busy still, Sows colours for the seasons in those plots, And matches or contrasts the chosen leaves That are to shade our saunters; the clean boughs Of aromatic walnut; the wild crab With, after snows of blossom, fiery fruit; And beeches of a grander race beyond them Withdrawing into uninvaded wood; But, farther down, our orchard falls to where The stream makes a live murmur all day long. Man is a builder born: not for the shell That makes him armour against stripping wind And frost and darkness; for befriending roof And walls to sally from, a bread-getter. No, but as out of mere unmeaning sound And the wild silence he has made himself Marvellous words and the order of sweet speech, Breathing and singing syllables, that move Out of the caverns of his heart like waves Into the world beyond discovery; so Builds he, projecting memory and strong hope And dear and dark experience into stone And the warm earth he digs in and reshapes, Dyeing them human, and with a subtle touch Discovering far kinships in the sky And the altering season, till the very cloud Brings its own shadow as to familiar haunts, And the sun rests as on a place it sought. Earth also as with a soft step unperceived Draws from her ancient silence nearer him, Sending wild birds to nest beneath his eaves Or to shake songs about him as he walks,— Shy friends, the airy playmates of his joy. Cæsars may hoist their towers and heave their walls Into a stark magnificence, impose The aggrandised image of themselves, as trumpets Shattering stillness. We'll not envy them, While there's a garden to companion us And earth to meet us with her gentle moss Upon our own walls. They may entertain Prodigally a thousand guests unpleased; But we have always one guest that is ever Lovely and gracious and acceptable, Light. As I lay upon a hill-top's turf I watched the wide light filling the round air And I was filled with its felicity. O the carriage of the light among the corn When the glory of the wind dishevels it! How it filters into the dim domes of trees Spilt down their green height, shadows dropping gold! How beautiful its way upon the hills At morning and at evening, when the blades Of grass blow luminous, every little blade! How the flowers drink it, happy to the roots! This lovely guest is ours to lodge; and we Will build for it escapes and entrances And corners to waylay the early beam And keep its last of lingering: here to accept Its royalty of fullness; there to catch In dusky cool one lustre on the floor Doubling itself in echoed radiances Mellow as an old golden wine, on wall And ceiling: oh, how gentle a touch it has On choice books, and smooth-burnished wood, in such Human captivity! When the winds roar over, What sudden splendours toss into our peace With reappearing victories! O the glory Of morning through a doorway on the hair, Neck, arms, young movements of a laughing child! O mystery of brightness when we wake In the night-hush and see upon the blind The trembling of the shadow of a tree Kissed by the moon, that from the buried light Wooes ghostliness of beauty, and receives And whispers it to all the world asleep. Whatever it be made of, this dreamed home Upon a hill, I know not in what vale, Shall be a little palace for the light To stray and sleep in and be blest for it. So thought I: then I thought, O my dear Love, Surely I am that house, and you the light. WESTWARD I found my Love among the fern. She slept. My shadow stole across her, as I stept More lightly and slowly, seeing her pillowed so In the short-turfed and shelving green hollow Upon a cushion of wild thyme, amid Tall bracken-tufts that, roughly luminous, hid Her hair in amber shadow. Then I stopped. The light was in the West: the wind had dropped; A burning fragrance breathed out of the ground, And the sea-murmur rose remote around. But my Love slept. My very heart was singing With the sweet swarm of winged thoughts it was bringing: And she lay there, with the just heaving breast, So still. As a lark drops down to its nest, I sank beside her, waiting for those eyes To complete earth with light that nowhere lies But in their depths for me, and carry home The flight of my full spirit. I had come From wandering wide beaches far beneath This airy height of summer-scented heath. I was alone, and the shore solitary, And the sea glittered infinite and starry As on the sands I paced, that dazzling wet Shone round, until the tumbled rocks they met At the gaunt cliff's root; silvery runnels, fed From oozy levels draining to their bed, Wound flashing between smoothly furrowed slabs Which the sky coloured; there the youngling crabs Had scrawled a trail, and weeds, dull-rose and green, Lay by their shadows, where old foam had been, Crusted with shells. A mist of finest spray Blew from the western glory, and in the bay The ever-streaming surges gleamed and roared Like a rejoicing Power for ever poured For the mere splendour of its motion: salt The air came to the nostril; and the vault Of heaven had burnt its colours into one Unfathomable clearness, that the sun Was soul of, as it journeyed down the West And in the leaping waters made each crest A moment of live fire. I breathed the immense And shining silence. It was to my sense Like youth, that's all horizon, and misgives Nothing, and in the unbounded moment lives, And names not hope yet among things endured And unamended, being so assured Of its desire and the long day, and so Ignorant of that swift Night, saying No. Ah, why should peace and liberty most bring Into the heart that loves them most the sting Of Time's oppression, and the thwarting thorns, The loss, the want, the many clouded morns? O for deliverance! To untwist the bond Of circumstance; to breathe the blest Beyond Where we would be; to incarnate clean and true All we were born and dedicated to! O Love, how often have we shared that sigh! To me beside that boundless sea and sky Intolerably came my briefness; all The undone things. Why into hearts so small Were crammed these hungering immensities, Thrust each day back to a prison that denies Their native satisfaction? I cast me down On a great slope of rock that, ribbed and brown, Was cloven at the top; and in between The hollowed ledges I could lightly lean And see the deep cup of a pool; it held Its limpid leaving of the surge that swelled, A tide since, over that sea-buried reef. A round pool, deeply clear beyond belief, Rough with minute white shells about its rim, Its crystal in the shadow gleamed how dim And small! while in my eye the homeless main, Its brine was of, a splendid restless plain Of water, spread a path for any keel To take, the round world over, and to feel Pressures of every wind, and haven far Where it should choose, mirroring mast and spar In sultry smooth lagoon, or under pines Snow-plumed on iron fiord, or where lines Of ships at a famed port with traffic hum And chimes of foreign bells to sailors come, And strange towers over crowded wharfs look high. —Ah! such a drop of casual life was I, At evening left: my simple, scanted, raw Experience but the sipping of a straw Snatched from me soon! I lifted up my gaze Into the west and the spray-misted blaze Where the sun gloried, and his glittering track Allured me on and on. Then I looked back. All was changed. Something had transfigured each Of those hard cliffs that thrust into the beach Their bouldered ramparts. Every narrow seam Brimmed with the opposite light, and the warm gleam Found out small clusters of sea-pink, and many A samphire-tuft in its uneven cranny, And bloomed a burning orange on the stain Of lichen, and dissembled rosy grain On the rock's blackness. At the summit showed A gemmy green, where the grass patches glowed Between those jutting crags. The air was hush; And the shore quivered with a phantom flush Of molten colours on far-shining sand. All was as warm to sight as to the hand, Distinct yet insubstantial, as if what The eye saw had been created by a thought Intenser than its vision. Memory played A music in the mind, and Time delayed To whisper names forgotten; I saw no more The sculpture of those rocks, that vivid shore; But far-off hours arose before me there Beautiful in a bright unearthly air. Memory touched her stops, and one by one They came, each with its own shadow and sun And its peculiar perfume: each a part Of the quick blood and pulsing of my heart. I carried riches; I was as a king, Clothed in a more than royal apparelling, Because of glories in the mind, and light In eyes I knew, and the unended flight Of thought, and friendship warmer than the sun, And dateless joy, and hope shared, and things done With all the soul's strength, and still precious pain. Youth, O sweet, careless Youth, flooding the vein With easy blood, what time the body knows Scarce that it is, so brimmingly life glows Within it, and its motions are like words Born happy on the lips, and like the birds On April-blossomed boughs rich fancies throng The mind's exuberance and spill in song, I think my heart back into all the bloom And feel it fresh. As one that enters home, I am there: the shyness, and the secret flame Of ecstasy that knew not any name, The wild heart-eating fevers, the young tears, The absorbed soul, the trouble, and the fears Wide as the night, the joy without a thought Meeting the morning,—Time has never taught My heart to lose them. Still I smell that rose Of so inscrutable sweetness; and still glows The glory of the wonder when I first Heard the enchanted poets, and they burst In song upon my spirit, as if before No one had ever passed that magic door, But for me, first in all the world, they sang. Sweetest of all things, Youth, sweet in the pang As in the pleasure, you are in me yet, Changed as the grape to wine: could I forget, Then were this hand dust. In those yesterdays Memory happy and familiar strays, Exploring hours that, long in shadow lain, Come effortlessly all distinct again, As in my light boat I would track the banks Of narrow streams that rippled past the ranks Of yellow-flowered reeds, and knew not where They led me, for no human sound was there, But the shy wings were near me, and I to them, And the wild earth was round me as in a dream And I was melted into it. I can hear, Lost in the green, bright silence, where I steer Beneath gold shadows wavering on my arm The water saying over its low charm Among the reeds, and, dreading to disturb The mirror of the blossomed willow-herb, Drink it into my heart. O idle hours, Floating with motion like the summer towers Of cloud in the blue noon, I have not drained Your fullness yet, for all that care has rained Upon defeated days of dark sundown, Like burial of all beauty and all renown, When the spirit sits within its fortalice And watches mute. One simple, passionate kiss Can alter earth for ever. Out of what Imagination, or what far forethought Of Time, came Love in beauty new and strange With eyes of light, my earth and sky to change And bring me vision of a promised land, As if long-sunken centuries had planned The meeting of our lips? From far we came To one another, ere we had a name. Wonderful shape, white ecstasy, the cup That God with living wine has so filled up! O body made like music, like a word Syllabled in spontaneous accord; Quick-sensed with apprehension; capable Of extreme joy, of pangs far-piercing; full Of divine wants, like a wave moving through The passionate and transparent soul of you; O mystery and power, charged with unknown Futurities; a lovely flame that's blown In the wind of life, and sister'd to all fire That has in it the peril of all desire; Dearer than breath, what are you made of, whence Come you? I know not; the eluded sense Only replies, “To name her is to tell The very name of Love.” It is to spell A language more profound than tongue can use, Written in the heart's blood of the world; to lose All that is worth the losing, and to trust In spite of withered leaf and charnel dust. Who knows his own beginning? Hour from hour Is born; in secret buds, and breaks to flower Within us. Nothing we have ever been, Nothing we have endured, nothing we have seen,— Ay, and before we came into this light, Were sacrificial hopes, and exquisite Fears, and the jealous patience of the womb, And throes of self-consuming martyrdom, Imprinted on the fibre of our flesh,— Nothing is ended, but is made afresh Into a subtler potency; the eyes See a more wondrous earth, the senses prize More, its more pregnant meaning; and we go To enrich a world beyond us, overflow Into a mind of what thoughts who can tell? O Love, we draw from an unfathomed well. Where are the June nights that made heaven a whole Blue jewel, throbbing through the very soul? Where is the dizzying bloom and the perfume— Earth-ecstasy, sighed up to starry gloom, That in the touching lips' ineffable Communion, was a spirit and a spell, As if we had found within ourselves a being More infinite than any shown to seeing? Where is the beauty that stole thought away And moved to tears some one remembered day? Where is the laughter some sweet chance would start, To leave its summer warmth about the heart? Where are the places we shall see no more? Are they not powers to haunt us at the core Of feeling, and evoke the eternal Now, Like music, out of nothing? Nay, I vow, Most perishable, most immortal tastes; And the frail flame, that touches us and hastes Into the dark, endures more than the build Of proudest fortress. We are found and filled; And it suffices. For we pass among Grandeurs, and from a grandeur we are sprung, Marvellous in our destiny, and know Man is most man meeting a giant foe, Whether overcoming or defeated. We, Who hear, like moving rumour of the sea And march of ocean waves, the human sound About us, filled with meaning more profound; Who know what hearts beat by us, and have shared In all the mighty martyr names have dared; Who feel all earth beneath the stars, the race Of rivers, and the mountains in their place, Faculties of our being; and have a mind Dyed in the ardent story of our kind; We in our briefness, in our storm and ache, Our loves magnificent in hearts that break, We, all our bonds and bounds exceeding, ay, Burning a loftier flame because we die, We at Time's outpost, we the thrust spear-head Against the opposing darkness of the dead, We are the world's adventure! We speed on, Stay not, but westward travel with the sun, Westward into the splendour that takes all, And carry far into the great light's fall That infinite memory of the world we bear Within our spirits, burning and aware. Wake, Love, awake!—Her eyes shone into mine That moment. In the air was light divine, Sinking and yet suspended still, to hold Rocks, ocean, heaven, within one bath of gold. But in the soul that met me from those eyes, Impassioning the beauty of the skies, Was my completion. Earth, as newly made Ev'n to the smallest shape of green grass-blade, Lived; and the thrilled, bright silence sang to me; For in the hush I heard the boundless sea. FROM THE CHINESE A flower, or the ghost of a flower! Mist, or the soul of it, felt In the secret night's mid hour, Lost on the morning air! Who shall recover it,—beauty born to melt As the apparition of blossom brief and shy, As the cloud in the sky that vanishes, who knows where? THE COCKATOO: FROM THE CHINESE A present from tropical Annam, A bird with a human speech, A gloriously plumed cockatoo Rosy as the flower of a peach! And they did what they also do To the learned, the witty, the sage;— Got a cage with the stoutest of bars And shut it up fast in the cage. FROM GOETHE Peace is perfect over All the hills. Scarce wilt thou discover A breath, so still's Every tree. The woods are silent; birds have hushed their song. Wait but thou; ere long Peace comes to thee. BOOK V (1920–1928) THE SIRENS AN ODE PRELUDE I remember a night of my youth, I remember a night Soundless! The earth and the sea were a shadow, but over me opened Heaven into uttermost heaven, and height into height Boundless With stars, with stars, with stars. I remember the dew on my face, I remember the mingled Homely smell of grass and unearthly beauty Out of the ends of the air and the unscaled darkness Poured in a rain, in a river, Into my marrow,—thro' all the veins of delight Poured into me. O the divine solitude, the intoxicating silence! I was a spirit unregioned, worthy of them; I, even I, was a creature of infinite flight, Born to be free. In the midst of the worlds, as they moved, I moved with them all, A sense and a joy; I was hidden, and yet they were nigh; For they came to me as lovers, Those stars from on high. Thus as my whole soul drank of the star-thrilled air, I felt more than heard, like a whisper Invading me out of immensity, hinted, haunting Sound Of waves, of waves, of waves. And I felt in the blood of my flesh to the roots of my hair, That it sought me, a mind in the muteness: In the midst of the worlds I trembled, I in the night a mortal Found! What was I? What was I? Nothing But a Moment, aware Of the ruins of Time! Yet a memory of memories awaking, I marvelled from where, Out of shadows unshapen within me, and dust under dust, From burial of realms and of ages, and darkness astir In the roots of the hungering forest, the ancientest lair, Rose to claim This my body, the sap of its veins and its secret to share; To emerge with the star-watching eyes of the venturer, Man. And my body was brimmed with its meaning; it knew whence it came, For I was the word on Earth's lips That she needed to name. But tell me, I cried, O whispering, troubling waves, Tell me, O journeying wildernesses of stars, Why do you near me &amp; choose me? Whither would you lure me, The earth-child? To be brimmed with desire overflowing the bounds of the world, To be wingless &amp; stretched on a longing that boundlessly craves, Who has known not this, in the bloom of a midnight marvelling Earth-exiled? But thus to be sought from afar by phantom waves, In the still of the night to be neared by stooping stars, As if all immensity sought for a home in the mind At its core, This draws my dark being up from its secret caves, And the flesh is no longer a home, nor can comforting Earth Shelter me more. I am known to the Unknown; chosen, charmed, endangered: I flow to a music ocean-wild and starry, And feel within me, for this mortality's answer, Sea without shore. I. THE VICTORIES [I.1] Masters of the known and found, Singers of a world completed, All to a time and end ordained, Powers foredestined to their bound And truth immutably contained, A dominion mapped and meted,— Like as in Egyptian noon Gods of granite throned august Gaze on old realms round them strewn Far as the horizon dust,— All beneath that searching sky Gathered into wisdom's eye! Prophets of the found and known, Chanters of the Laws unchanging, Comes not an hour that undoes all With a whispered homelessness, With a sudden touch estranging? Certainties you deemed your own, Housing with a friendly wall, Glide into a doubt and guess Swift as when, the low light going, Darkness on the wind comes flowing Out of nothing; and surmise, Dream, desire, are frontierless; And the unroofed mind has skies To breathe of, where a rumour sings Of other mind and vaster things Wooed to wilder destinies. Thought throbs: there a power entices (Like, on a wonder-night, all June In a draught of stolen spices) Not to stay, not to stay, But to embark for the outer dark. Only charms the untrodden way, Only the unspelt secret rune. Conqueror with foot superb Planted on the last step won, Whom the trumpet-mouths proclaim Destiny's accepted son, Robed in a resounding name, What profounder pangs disturb Something that's unquarried yet In the deep soul? All the gain Weighs but as an ashy grain In the world those pangs beget. Fierce fruitions but betray And deliver to the hard Hope of things unhazarded. Where that world is, who shall say? Under western evening starred Black waves tempt to far-away Visioned walls of a wide shore, Lands the only-coveted, Gleaming as they gleamed before Alexander's dying eyes In the tent at Babylon. Dumb his soldiers streamed beside him, Dumb'd with grief that only saw The pillar of the world undone, Nor guessed what potent visions gnaw The unsated mind with cruelties,— Ramparts where Time's jealous spies, Sentinelled afar, deride him, Mocking all that passion willed With the frustrate and the unfulfilled. O the inexorable Lure Spur to the demon hearts of men! Ravening Genghis, hot Timour, And the empire-storming Saracen, Fate's infuriate charioteers, Fly from a whisper in their ears (Earth before them, Time behind) Whispering, “Haste ere blood be chill, Storm and scatter, work your will!” Hunters hunted in the mind, Hunting what they cannot name, Thunder over earth, to find Nothing. Though the harvest black Be reaped in rue and curse and wrong, There's a thing they cannot tame. Still they keep their torrent-track, Maddened by a shadowy song Sung beyond the reach of sense. What song is this which wastes the worth Of human things, and distastes earth, And fevers with magnificence Of swiftness, trampling, ruin-crowned, Toward a goal that none has found? Is it the song the Adventurer stole Body-bound upon the mast For the enchantment of his soul? Over farthest foam of waves That are sailors' restless graves, He heard exulting as he passed Perilous voices challenging The mortal heart of him, and fear Became a glory, so to hear Secure as an immortal, sing The Sirens. I.2 Whither is she gone, wing'd by the evening airs, Yon sail that draws the last of light afar, On the sea-verge alone, despising other cares Than her own errand and her guiding star? She leaves the safe land, leaves the roofs, and the long roads Travelling the hills to end for each at his own hearth. She leaves the silence under slowly-darkening elms, The friendly human voices, smell of dew and dust, And generations of men asleep in the old earth. Between two solitudes she glides and fades, And round us falls the darkness she invades. Waters empty and outcast, O barren waters! What have your wastes to do With the earth-treader, the earth-tiller; this frail Body of man; the sower, whom the green shoot gladdens; Hewer of trees; the builder, who houses him from the bleak winds, And whom awaits at last long peace beneath the grass In soil his fathers knew? What shall he hope for from your careless desolation, Lion-indolence, or cold roar of your risen wrath? What sows he in your furrows, or what fruit gathers But hazard, loss, and his own hard courage? ... Yon sail goes like a spirit seeking you. I heard a trumpet from beyond the moon, Piercing ice-blue gulfs of air, Cry down the secret waters of the world, Under the far sea-streams, to summon there The foundered ships, the splendid ships, the lost ships. In their ribb'd ruin and age-long sleep they heard, Where each had found her shadowy burial-bed, Clutched in blind reef, shoal-choked or shingle-bound; Heard from betraying isles and capes of dread In corners of all oceans, where the light Gropes faltering over their spilt merchandize: And shapes at last were stirred On glimmerless abysses' oozy floors Known to the dark fins only and drowned eyes;— Sunk out of memory, they that glided forth Bound from cold rivers to the tropic shores, Or questing up the white gloom of the North, Or shattered in the glory of old wars, The laden ships, the gallant ships, the lost ships! I saw them clouding up over the verge, Ghosts that arose out of an unknown grave, Strange to the buoyant seas that young they rode upon And strange to the idle glitter of the wave. Magically re-builded, rigged and manned, They stole in their slow beauty toward the land. Mariners, O mariners! I heard a voice cry; Home, come home! Here is the rain-fresh earth; leaf-changing seasons; here Spring the flowers; and here, older than memory, peace Tastes on the air sweet as honey in the honey-comb. Smells not the hearth-smoke better than spices of India? Are not children's kisses dearer than ivory and pearls? And sleep in the hill kinder than nameless water And the cold, wandering foam? Dear are the names of home, I heard a far voice answer, Pleasant the tilled valley, the flocks and farms; and sweet The hum in cities of men, and words of our own kin. But we have tasted wild fruit, listened to strange music; And all shores of the earth are but as doors of an inn; We knocked at the doors, and slept; to arise at dawn and go. We spilt blood for gold, trafficked in costly cargoes, But knew in the end it was not these we sailed to win; Only a wider sea; room for the winds to blow, And a world to wander in. I.3 O divine summits and O unascended solitudes! O alone soaring over care and stain! Who without wing shall set foot upon your pinnacles? Or who your spaciousness of light attain? Flames in the dawn-cold, towering incredible, When else the earth is shadow-drowned and prone, Veiled and unveiled by the misty-footed winds that guard Bright chasm and black gulf round a thunder-throne, Realmed with a vision beyond reaches of mortality,— Thither some splendour in the mind aspires, Sharing the terror of your dark, tumultuous sisterhood, Silent in glory as of chanting choirs. Changing and changeless, O far-illumined Presences In apparition from some world august, Up from this flesh have you drawn us, as in ecstasy That thirsts to elude this forfeiture of dust. Even on your last heights man has set his perilous foot, And mid the void as on some dazzling shore Stands in the vast air, stricken and insatiate, Wingless, a spirit craving wings to soar. Now at last voyaging a fabulous dominion Surpassing all the measures of his kind, He, a free rider of the undulating silences, Has in himself begotten a new mind; Made him a companion of the winds of Heaven, travelling Unpaven streets of cloudy golden snows, Piercing forlorn mist, cold though it encompass him Like a dead mind that nothing sees or knows, Vacant, a cavern fleecy and immaterial, A soundless vapour that he pulses through, Suddenly emerging, and swims into the sun again And steers his path up toward the topless blue;— Towers in the frosty flame-apparelled mystery Of brain-intoxicating sharp sapphire Round him and above him, throbbing in the midst of it, A daring, a defiance, a desire! Mote in the hollow vast, drowned amid the vivid light, Invading far and far the virgin sky, Charioting with beats of fire the fiery-beating heart of man (O heart of flesh, O force of dread!) on high! Careless of death is he, riding in the eagle's ways Above the peak and storm, so dear a sting Drives him unresting to strive beyond the boundaries Of his condition, being so brief a thing, Being a creature perishable and passionate, To drink the bright wine, danger, and to woo Life on the invisible edge of airy precipices, A lover, else to his own faith untrue, Giving the glory of youth for flower of sacrifice Upon the untried way that he must tread, So that he savour the breath of life to the uttermost, Breath only sweet when all is hazarded. Is it that, moving in a rapture of deliverance From chains of time and paths of dust and stone, Serving a spirit of swiftness irresistible, He makes his pilgrimage, alone, alone, Seeking a privacy of boundlessness, abandoning A self surpassed, yet other worlds to dare? Nay, in that element hailing his predestinate World, and exulting to be native there? I.4 Hymn the Finders! Hymn the bold Trusters of Earth, those patient ones, That listen to the subtle words Of Silence in the streams and stones; Ponderers of the secret-souled Bodies quick with ignorant being; Followers of the clues that thread Differences and accords; Wooers of what powers agreeing May the hands of man bestead; Seers who have turned aside From the greeds that ask and ache Blinded to all else beside,— Letting the clear spirit take Truth from vision open-eyed. Breaks the bud for him that sees In a world of promises. Hymn the breaker of the dark, Hymn the finder of the flame, Troubler of the essential spark Lurking in the withered pith Or from stony prison freed, Friend and fury, holy need And fierce destroyer, hard to tame, Risen, a God to wrestle with! Hymn the bender of the wheel, Mother of the shapes of speed! Hymn the launcher of the keel Carrying thought's arrow-aim Beyond the sundown,—sowing seed Of man on coasts untrod before, To widen memory's haunted shore And add the nearness of a name. Far-descended old desire! That stirred in swarming forest-ages, Prowled by fear whose stealthy eye Watched from glooms, where hunger-rages Ravened; see at last the Hand Emerging human, stretched to try Shapes of things with wondering pleasure, When its strength forgets to kill; Tempted on to understand, Serving ways of secret will,— Fit and fashion, poise and measure. Hymn the hand that builds the wall And spans the river, and arches over Man the worshipper and lover Song-like stone; the hand so strong To strike, yet in whose touch is all Life's mystery that wooes from things Their strength, as music from the strings,— Touch of the mind that seeks behind The world for the befriending Mind. Hymn the openers of the gates! Hymn the changers of the fates! Hymn the seekers! them that saw, Past the seeming starry roof Of human earth, in mazy plan Bright eternities of law; Them that neared those orbs to man, Unafraid, and put to proof Divination's ancient scheme; Stept into the timeless stream, Star-like spirits among the stars! Hymn the seekers! Chosen souls, Grapnel'd in the very marrow By a thought that night and day Draws them whither their unknown Mighty lover far away Beckons them to the frore Poles Or new meridians; like to him Who climbed in Panama the tree, And splendour of untravelled sea Smote him like a glorious arrow: Never shall he rest again Till he sail that virgin main! Or like him who quietly Sitting in his Polar tent Found so great a way to die; Hope-forsaken, famine-spent, Wrote his words of faith and cheer Till the pen dropt from the hand That wrote them. Hymn the lost, who never Found, but kept high heart to steer Onward toward the mark they meant, Sailing out of sight of land. Wail not them, nor lost endeavour, For they heard what tranced the ear, Filled the exulting soul, the song Pale and prudent mortals fear, Song of those who, out of Time, Sing the heights the immortals climb, The Sirens. II. PENUMBRA [II.1] Hearken to the hammers, endlessly hammering, The din of wheels, the drone of wheels, the furnaces Panting, where Man as in a demon-palace toils To forge the giant creatures of his brain. He has banished the spring and the innocence of leaves From the blackened waste he has made; the infected sky Glooms with a sun aghast, and the murk of the night Is peopled with tall flames like spirits insane. He strips himself to the heat, not of the jovial sun, But of the scorch of furnaces; with naked breast Sweating beneath the iron and blear glass, amid The hammers' hammering and the wheels' roar. Not with grapes of October trodden underfoot Spurting juices of ripeness in runnels, his vats Brim, but with gushes flickered-over and blinding, Unshapen spilth and blaze of molten ore. With a finger he lifts the weight of mountain-sides Poised; the metal mass he shears red-hot in a trice; He has given to the animate iron thews of force, A Titan's pulse, and breath of fiery draught. Monsters mightier far than himself he creates To swim storming seas, and to mount in miles of air, To deride Space and the old opposition of Time: Their speed is like strong drink that he has quaffed. He has the tamed lightning to do his bidding, draws Energies out of the veins of earth; he is armed From all elements, woven as in a magic web; He has stolen seeds of Death, wherewith to fight. He holds fabled terrors of the ancient gods in his hand— In a handful of dust, earthquake and pestilence; He exults to destroy, to obliterate, to be Lord of the powers of the engulfing night. Deafened with the hammers, inebriate with the sound Of the powers he has raised out of their jealous lair, He has fever within him, he becomes dizzy, And craves, and knows not whither he is bound. Shall he attain god-like felicity of ease, Supreme articulate voice of nature's striving, Or builds he a vast prison for himself, a slave With iron of his own strong forging crowned? Insatiable of ransacked worlds, and exulting Furiously in feet-supplanting speed, the proud-eyed Victor, he who has come so far, so far, looks forth To achieve the eluded glory of his goal. What solitude is this that suddenly he enters? Voices of earth no more with anchoring kindness call. The fevered hammers throb; but deep within he knows The desert he has made in his own soul. O where is now the dew-dropt radiance of morning, That sistered with him leafing tree and rippling stream, When simple of heart in the sun with a free body He accepted all the boundaries of his mind? Full of fears he was then, shadowed with helpless need To propitiate Powers that threatened each footstep. Has he escaped from those old terrors, to be prey Of fears more terrible because less blind? II.2 Ah, did men feign you once, triumphant Sirens, Omnipotent in your lure On a far spice-island over legendary surges Singing, and divine you with the famished eyes of mariners, Listen in a trance to your voices, but listen In a dream secure? Lost amid strange and hungry waters They fabled the storm-worn sailor stung By a vision of arms outstretched at the end of the world,— Eternal woman, wonderful, with a bosom Heaved as with love, and with warm, white eyelids Over eyes cruel and young. From those voluptuous throats, magical throats, As out of a coral-lipped, an ivory-coloured Dazzling flower, tormenting sweetness floats, Sweetness of voices, odour of strange, strange longing Felt on the flesh like trail of perfumed hair, In sound that stole like soft arms round the soul Drawn thither and inescapably aware Of nothing but the extreme ache to press Lips on those lips, that thirst to suck the breath, The heart's blood, into theirs, till eyes grow dull, Till lips be lips no longer, and only a skull Roll from your feast of death, O sated Sirens! But what if it be that fond perfidious Voices With different music lure Even us who have cast far from us the fables of old? If the pride of our quest undo us, and they enchant us Simple as those lost mariners, but no longer In dream secure? If not with sorcery of song in a scarlet mouth And with eyes of desire You ensnare the easy senses and perishing flesh, But with spiritual lure you hunger to entice us Beyond the borders of knowledge, O evilly enamoured, O terrible choir? If shadowy at the end of time you wait, Wooing subtly the while Man's spirit, tempted On ever more extravagant quest, and bait His blood with charm of secrecy and peril, Ay, and waylay the longings of his mind, Yielding by dear degrees what he exults to seize, Until he glows to seem the unconfined Master of earth, the world's sole will, but only That you may taste his glory, spent and shared, Before you press upon his lips the last Kiss of annihilation, and he be cast Into the void prepared, Malignant Sirens! II.3 “Whither, Whither?” I heard a crying That asked of Night, and there was none replying. “Whither, into what land of change and wrack, Into what time out-racing thought and will, With feet borne onward and mind beaten back Over an earth that our lost loves has buried, Against a dark wind blowing chill, Whither are we driven, whither hurried? “Lovely vales of our youth, where haunted Peace of the ripening years, and hope that vaunted Its strength so rooted in earth's purposes That children's children should possess peace there! O sunny vales, and corn, and guardian trees, Shut off by the blind rain's down-dropping curtain,— Vanished, as if they never were, And doubt alone were certain! “Heaven we feigned in a time perfecting Our missed design, and beauty of our neglecting. There should we live completed in an age Wise from our loss and rich with all our spoil, A race redeeming its lost heritage, Not by vain fears checked, nor by vain hopes cheated. —If that heaven fade, and futureless we toil, And battle already defeated? “Words of beauty, words of assuaging Majesty saw we on high above time's raging Inscribed as over some vast porch serene; Pardon: the heart flowed out on tides of peace. Justice: the soiled soul hasted to be clean. One word we feared not, dreamed not, named not even, The end.—If All utterly cease; Earth, Time, Desire, Hell, Heaven?” Titan spirit of god-like stature; Star-measurer, holder of deep clues of nature; Maker, but half-aware of what he makes, Of what the extravagant flame in him devours, And what unshapen Vastness he awakes,— Toiled in the terrible webs his mind invented, And caught in flame that twists and towers, Man strives with himself tormented. Born for ever to move, the Dancer Of dark Creation's dream, its destined answer,— Joy were those limbs created to express! Now like one darkly stumbling, while his brain Puzzles each motion with too anxious stress, Under the glory of stars that move unhalting He burns with the old need onward still to strain, Mis-timed, way-lost, defaulting. II.4 Hearken to the eternal lovers rejoicing! A sunrise in their hearts, a music in their veins, Their bodies make sweet singing to one another; They bathe in beams from one another's eyes. They rejoice to belong to the Eternal Delight Upon whose universe of buoyance they are launched, That questions not of its way nor of its haven But is both way and haven where it hies. They marvel to be born in a new element, To meet like streams as they go chiming to the sea, To move like flames that touch and tremble; and marvelling They look back on the voided shell they quit. Dawn within dawn, light within light, unfolds for them The secret of the world, that flowing overflows The sun and the moon and the farthest of the stars, And it abounds in them, and they in it. Beautiful are their fears as the shy-footed fawns Safe only in wildness from the old hunter, Time, To be assured in shadow of the heart's solitude, Where joy finds joy that never Time records. They have made virgin words of that soiled alphabet Wherewith have been written histories of sorrow, Labour and long defeat, and proud and vain conquest; And all their lore is those sufficing words. Magnificent they match the music of a name Against abhorred Silence and terrors of the abyss, The trust of a smile against all-ignoring Night, And one low voice against Oblivion's greed. Difference drew them to the enamoured wrestle, Chosen, inevitable dear antagonists; They cry one to the other; “Alone I was not I,” “O lovely danger!” and “O my angel need!” “Because thy sweetness is so troubling and so sharp, Full of blood-thrilling strangeness, unexplored peril, Never to be possessed, always to be desired, Thou unknown world, I will dare all for thee.” “Though in a moment thou hast made me to forget All that I was and had, triumphing I hold thee; To thy darkness of strength I give and commit me; Here is thy world, O sail upon my sea!” As the East that quickens and flushes to the height Answering the ardour of the West, and as a rose Quivers on the western cloud before the dayspring, Divided as the East and West they are: But upon ways invisible to mortal sense Moves their bright union, where was created new Love's wondrous world; from the darkness it emerges; It is their Evening and their Morning Star. Out of the hollows of unpenetrated Night From afar calls to them, though they have known it not, A voice that is theirs, yet is not theirs, a new voice Never yet heard, yet older than all things; Laughter of a child's voice, sweeter than any sound On the earth or in the air, voice of eternal joy, Victorious over the bowed wisdom of mortals, A well beyond the world, that springs and sings. III. THE UNDISCOVERED WORLD [III.1] O in a living stream to bathe That runs its course from spring to sea! And O to cast this aching mesh Of iron bands that starkly swathe Limbs that labour, neck to knee! To feel the wind upon the flesh, Wind that was before man was, Blowing out of blue divine; Feel the feet on morning grass Lightly firm, and body bare Over-showered with beams so fine As cleanse the very heart of care! Sages, had you found but this For the mind, so it could use What the body knows of bliss When all thought it loves to lose Merely poising in the sun, Sure of powers a-spring within it Rippling out to leap and run,— Like for memory's waiting ear Silence, ere the music win it:— When unreasoned joy alone Brims the body, itself its own Infinity unquestioning; Careless, Life is O so near, Death a legendary thing, Breath and blood like bells that ring;— Sages, had you art to find Such a glory for the mind, Not with eyes that are too wise But the lover's wonder-vision Seeing far and seeing near As within one radiant sphere All things living, joined and whole, Bloomed with light of Paradise; Sages, then—but who has taught Such an end for labouring thought, Such a nakedness of soul;— What but probing, doubting, and division? Hark, on iron iron's endless clamour! The hours, the hours, drive swifter than we strain— Earth changes not, but who has changed us, As if a Fury with a shadowy hammer Nailed the nails into the fiery brain? Who has estranged us? What dark enemy within Makes of Earth an enemy? Is it not he who sought of old Secrets of her wealth to win, Hot with greed and overbold, Aching to possess her? he, Searching labyrinthine veins, Thirsted for yet rarer gains, And through patient nights perused Each divided element, Curious of that pregnant dust Which with intent hand he bruised; Crucibled in fire the grains That should subtly be cajoled In the end to yield his lust Feasts of gold—a continent Molten into dazzling gold! (Were not heard the Sirens then Deriding the poor dreams of men?) Nay, but he would scrutinize Even Night's deep-ordered scheme, And spell his own proud destinies In scripture of the starry stream. Coveting what power those skies Might enthrone, he sought a charm That should warp them and should woo To his use, and by such aid To disimperil of one harm This brief body, would undo A universe. And he arrayed In a constellated robe His heaven-projected effigy, Because his spirit was afraid Of its nakedness, nor dared Terrors of the truth to probe; Rather chose itself to ensky In a dream. But no night bared To him her grandeur, swerved no spheres To the wrench of human fears. Earth and Night to crave of lust Yield but fruitlessness and dust; Dust to lust, to greed a weed! Mockers rise from those forgotten years: “This is he, the self-dupe, still the same Vaunter of a world of his defiling! Claiming heavens, with only will to maim. Who is this to own an earth's empire, In whose blood is mud, and this aviling Squalor of desire?” Lo, with feet on fiery ashes Earth's foiled master casts his eyes Round his world-abode. Time's heir, Freed by blood of martyrs, wise With myriad lives of thought and care, Into Doubt's dim future gropes, Black with omen, lit with flashes! Lo, beneath his heaven of hopes Falling palaces of dream, Proudly pillared; regions wreckt, Peopled with stray flames that seem Hot greeds from his burning brain And the very earth infect. Lo, like bodies for his fear Shadowy shapes of force insane Menacing in murk appear, Primed with energy to kill,— Engines of his intellect, Incarnations of his will! Those old siren-songs of air Change into a song abhorred, Chanting softly, Revel, Lord! Triumph, Master! This you sought! This your own proud hands have wrought! Now the lover's loathing taste Comes on him for what he burned So imperiously to clutch. Where is now the bliss embraced, Where the conquest? At a touch All's to desolation turned. Is it he, or Earth, betrays? She that seemed to sting him on To possession, once possessed, Dispossesses him. Her breast Stony grows, and hard her gaze. —Yet, oh, could she again be wooed In her own, her chosen ways, Shall she not transform her mood, Glorify with truth his quest, Give, as lovers give, entire Body to body, mind to mind, Ay, and more than these can find,— Spirit to spirit? Beauty of Desire, Beauty beyond possession still is breathing, Beauty in us defaced! O secret spring eternal, muddied here, Soiled and sunken, troubled into seething! Torrent of Desire, by greed and fear Spilled into waste! III.2 Be still! Wash out this dull roar from the ear That fevers Time; be emptied the hot brain Of clamorous, intricately-teasing toil. Let spiritual Silence brim again The mind's well to a mirror virgin-clear; All these invented cares smoothe and uncoil. Contemplate Silence; the wild Silence, ere Music or word was; waste, unshapen sound; Crying of wind; moaning of sea; stammer of storm; Gropings as for a being nowhere found; Mateless desires, frustrated throbs of air, Without home, without form. They sought a lodge in haunted flesh, they sought The inward tingling sense's touched accord; To be delivered, to be born perfect On shapes of lips, a breathed, a living word, A flower that seeds its riches, thought from thought, Incarnate sound, mysterious and elect. Contemplate Silence! The unwithered womb Of all music infinite as desire; All words, releasing tears and bliss; all song, That wins at last a universe for choir, And there the enlarged spirit has full room, There its desires and its delights belong. All speech, all song, all music still unborn, Waits there for its futurity of mind To become human; yet it holds some tone Drawn from a something vaster than mankind, As from profounder heart-strings torn, And yet complete in man alone; As if behind him travailing, the whole Dark world were seeking in this eloquent flesh Some other self, and sighing here to be Born afresh, born afresh; To win a world yet undiscovered in the soul: “O Voice,” it cries, “utter; O Hands, deliver me!” With such a dark quest in desirous eyes, From the ancient East, as through a silent gate In the mind's city and labyrinth of thought, Those Magian Kings, of knowledge satiate, Of riches satiate, and forlornly wise, Down desert gorges brought Gifts for the Unknown: nay, but Earth from far In yearning sent them, her ambassadors. Rocks opened veins of gold, trees oozed their blood, Spices sighed, gems burned up from cavern-floors, The very Night had made Desire a star, That over against them, strange and certain, stood; And thither laden with Earth's hope and want, Her symbol'd sighs and riches of her pain, Down separate passes of the mountain streaming Wound onward each amid his marvelling train, Those sages drawn from towers of midnight haunt By their prophetic dreaming; And trumpet thrilled to trumpet thro' the night, And torches told of glistering strange attire, Where met those three kings on one errand led. What image shaped they of the World's Desire, What presence throned in majesty and might, As they went musing, deep in hope and dread, And under vast cope of the wheeling skies Found but a naked child, a child new-born? Wisdom resigned the crown of her enthroning; All her impassioned question was forsworn: In wonder she saw all things with new eyes. Then, there were songs of joy; now, sound of a world groaning. III.3 Mystery of Dawn, ere yet the glory streams Risen over earth, and pauses in that hush When far, as from an ecstasy, clouds flush, And hills lift up their pureness into dreams Of light that not yet colours the cold flower, And the earth-clasping, heaven-desiring tree Trembles in virginal expectancy— What breath of the unknown Power Is this that, spirit to spirit, as with a spousal kiss Comes seeking us, even us, through shadow and dew,— Seeking in this soiled flesh what undiscovered world Beyond tears, beyond bliss, beyond wisdom, beyond Time? what recaptured harmony of earth and heaven? What world made new? A world so strange, the spirit thrills to flame, Transfigured in a wonder of release! A world so near, it has no other name Than light and breath! Where lost we, then, this peace? Wanting what charm to cleanse Our eyes? To see; is this the last of gifts, That, as the scales drop, the heart so uplifts? O world where no possession is of men's, Where the will rages not with fever to destroy Differing wills, or warp another life to its use, But each lives in the light of its own joy! In one wide vision all have share, and we in all, Infinitely companioned with the stars, the dust, Beasts of the field, and stones, and flowers that fall! This body that we use seems in that air Marvellous; secret from ourselves; a power Without which were no speech, nor deed done anywhere, Nor could thought range and tower, Nor seed be sown for the unborn time to reap; Whose natural motion was ordained to be Beautiful as a wave out of a sea Boundless as mind asleep; So passionately shaped, in every part perfect, Universes are wounded in its abasement, Crying from stone to star; The unimagined height, the immeasurable deep, Hungers, abysses, heavens, millions of ghosts from far Meet in this body born to laugh and weep. Weep; not for the endured, ancestral ill, Perils and plagues, that ambush all our ways, Time's injury, and pain's deep-wandered maze; These need not eyes to see, but only flesh to feel. But of the eternal vision to partake, And see what we have done, and what refused, To what accepted blindness we grow used, And what marred shapes of one another make, This is to weep such tears as no flesh-throes have cost, Weep for our loves, our loves, that we ourselves have slain, The powers of loveliness that we have left forlorn. Eyes we had and saw not, ears and we did not hear! Ah, when the heart, full-visioned, breaks in shame and pain, Then is the world's hope born. The cry of desolation turns to praise. If falsehood first enchant the eager mind, And if desire be cruel, being blind, Each by its own infirmity betrays, And some profounder, more imperious need Drives through all smart, whatever world to lose, The pure vision to choose, And tho' Truth kill, there in the end be freed. Open, open, gates of deliverance, open! See, liberated spirits, see, victorious ones, For testimony of us from homes of glory shine, Vindicators of this brief flesh, they mingle us,— Soiled and despoiled,—with beauty and with felicity, And sting us from afar with the Divine. Hands of men stretched out in so dark a craving! Baffled heart, clouded vision; filled with ache To know you have maimed the world you sought to make Your instrument and minister, enslaving Powers of earth and air—Hands that have wrought So glorious things, the thoughts of joy to house! Heart that has pulsed so ardent for its vow's Accomplishment,—O heart so hardly taught! O stretched-out hands! of you Eternity has need. Give but your sacred passion and your shaping art, The hunger of Eternity is there,— Barren else, barren: chaos and a wilderness Of feud and everlasting greed devouring greed, The unshapen dream's despair! Spirit of Man, dear spirit, sore opprest With self-estrangement, and mis-choosing will, And all satiety of gainful skill,— Possession that was never yet possessed,— You that have been so great a lover, giving In innocency all for sacrifice; Whom neither Time nor earth's regions suffice— You too are sought, where still your dream is living. Over the secret oceans of uncharted mind Who knows what voyagers, what sails invisibly Press on, for all the lost, the foundered hopes untrue? Who knows, through ignorant mists and storm upon that sea What Lover, what unweariable Adventurer, Makes still his quest of you? O world that is within us, yet must still Out of the eternal mystery be wooed Ere it be ours and, breathing in the blood, Live in its beauty, as the miracle Of the divine colour of flowers in night Was not, and is not of themselves alone Nor of the dawn-beam, but of both made one,— A marriage-mystery of earth and light! O undiscovered world that all about us lies When spirit to Spirit surrenders, and like young Love sees Heaven with human eyes! World of radiant morning! Joy's untravelled region! Why lies it solitary? and O why tarry we? Why daily wander out from Paradise? III.4 World-besieging Storm, from horizon heaped and menacing Rear up the walls of thunder, till they tower Shattering over earth, and from heart to heart reverberate, Lancing that bright fear through the ruin-shower! Revel, Winds, severing the bough of leafy promises With rages from returning chaos sent! Mockers and Destroyers, come; here is Man, predestinate To all your arrows at his bosom bent. Strip him of his splendours, of his conquests and dominions, His secure boast to be earth's lord enthroned, Humble him: he stands forth greater in his nakedness Than in the wealth and safety that he owned. He that has so loved peril in all experience, He that has gone with Sorrow all her way, Will not now refuse or shrink; prove him to the innermost, With worse than worst confront him: come what may, Lo, you awake, O Trumpets of Calamity, Some fragment of old Darkness in his breast; Lo, to him fraternal is the stony and the terrible place: His stricken Genius out of deeps unguessed Rises up, grappling his reality to reality, And still the secret in himself explores, Bound beyond fear, the discovered and discoverer, And in his own soul touches farthest shores. Though he be stript of all, Powers from far replenish him, Powers of the streaming worlds that through him stream. O throbbing heart, O lifted arms, O tenderness, O only capable of grief supreme! O earth for ever mingled with unearthliness Because the eternal with the brief is twined! Wonder of breath that is momentary and tremulous Suffices him who breathes eternal mind. Vision that dawns beyond knowledge shall deliver him From all that flattered, threatened, foiled, betrayed. Lo, having nothing, he is free of all the universe, And where light is, he enters unafraid. THE IDOLS AN ODE Luce intellettual, piena d' amore PRELUDE Lo, the spirit of a pulsing star within a stone Born of earth, sprung from night! Prisoned with the profound fires of the light That lives like all the tongues of eloquence Locked in a speech unknown! The crystal, cold and hard as innocence, Immures the flame; and yet as if it knew Raptures or pangs it could not but betray, As if the light could feel changes of blood and breath And all-but-human quiverings of the sense, Throbs of a sudden rose, a frosty blue, Shoot thrilling in its ray, Like the far longings of the intellect Restless in clouding clay. Who has confined the Light? Who has held it a slave, Sold and bought, bought and sold? Who has made of it a mystery to be doled, Or trophy, to awe with legendary fire, Where regal banners wave? And still into the dark it sends Desire. In the heart's darkness it sows cruelties. The bright jewel becomes a beacon to the vile, A lodestar to corruption, envy's own: Soiled with blood, fought for, clutched at; this world's prize, Captive Authority. Oh, the star is stone To all that outward sight, Yet still, like truth that none has ever used, Lives lost in its own light. Troubled I fly. O let me wander again at will (Far from cries, far from these Hard blindnesses and frozen certainties!) Where life proceeds in vastness unaware And stirs profound and still: Where leafing thoughts at shy touch of the air Tremble, and gleams come seeking to be mine, Or dart, like suddenly remembered youth, Like the ache of love, a light, lost, found, and lost again. Surely in the dusk some messenger was there! But, haunted in the heart, I thirst, I pine.— Oh, how can truth be truth Except I taste it close and sweet and sharp As an apple to the tooth? I.1 On a starr'd, a still mid-night Lost I halted, lost I gazed about. Great shapes of trees branched black into the sky: There was no way but wandered into doubt; There was no light In the uncertain desert of dim air But such as told me of all that was not I,— Of powers absorbed, intent, and active without sound, That rooted in their unimagined might, Over me there ignoring towered and spread. Homeless in my humanity, and drowned In a dark world, I listened, all aware; And that world drew me. The shadowy crossing of the boughs above my head Enmeshed me as with undecipherable spells: The silence laid invisible hands upon my heart, And the Night knew me. She put not forth her full power, well I knew: She only toyed With reason, used to sunshine flatteries, The praise of happy senses, trusted true, And smile of stable Earth's affirming ease. Yet even in this her ante-room I felt, Near me, that void Without foundation, roof, or bound, or end, Where the eyes fast from their food, the heavenly light, The untallied senses falter, being denied, The mind into itself is pressed, is penned, Even memoried glories of experience melt Into one mapless, eyeless, elemental Night. It was so near That like a swimmer toiled in a full-streaming tide Drawing him unawares down the unsounded seas, My soul sank into fear. O for one far beam of the absenting sun! O for a voice to assure me, and to release Out of this clutching silence! There is none: Shadow on shadow, and stillness on stillness Enclose me, and fasten round. Is this a world which Day never has known? A world made only of doubt and dream and dread? Is this the interior Night of the dark human soul, And the immaterial blackness branching from the ground A fearful forest that itself has sown Against the stars to tower,— Stars that dispense their faint uncertain dole Of light, that darkness may the more abound? Whither am I come? Where have my wandered feet Brought me on circling steps, led by what furtive power? Alas! in this dumb gloom wherein my spirit gropes Only myself I meet. Only myself; but in what strange image Encountered and phantasmally surprised! This thing of stealth that rises from the shrouds of sleep, I know it, I with shuddering guess presage An enemy,—the native of the night That in me was disguised. Hollow-echoing caverns where blind rivers creep With soundless motion; ice-cold, sudden breath Of climbing cloud, at whose abstracting touch The upholding rock seems baseless as the mist; Black silence in the eagle's captive stare Empty of all but the baulked lust of death, Could not oppress so much. Even that which in the dark brain says “I am,” Desperate in its faltering to persist, Flickers like an expiring lamp's last leap of flame To leave me I know not where. Let not the beautiful world perish and cease! My heart cries, freezing in its secret cells. Let me not be extinguished in the abyss, Losing the blessèd touch and taste of things, Earth's heaven of hues and smells! I am so far from worlds where any fountain springs, Sunken into this placeless dungeon-dream, That holds me without wall, or roof, or door. The light is only legend: I begin To give away my being like a stream Wandering among unshapen shapes, that spin A world of unintelligible dread; And this world seeks me for its own! All is dissolved, nothing has meaning more. Each moment heaps an age of time above my head. It is the very Mind of Darkness I am in, Lost, and alone, alone! I.2 The Forests of the Night awaken blind in heat Of black stupor; and stirring in its deep retreat, I hear the heart of Darkness slowly beat and beat. As if Earth, shrouded dense in gloom, Shuddered in her guilty womb; As if a power from under earth Would bring some monstrous spirit to birth; As if a spirit ran pursued And sobbing through the shadowy wood; Ghostly throbs of sound begin To circle from the distance in, A phantom beating, dulled, remote, With madness in its fever-note. I know not what about me or what above me oppresses The suffocating air; but fear within me guesses A peopling of the caverned glooms, miasma-cold recesses. Leaves depending still, still, Bronzed to blackness, spill Dead light from a sinking moon, Wholly to be sunken soon, Wandering down a desert coast At the horizon's end, a lost Eternal exile from the Day, Whence she stole a perished ray That falls from off those fingered fronds, Black as vipers, cold as bronze. O is it from my heart or from the darkness round, The far reverberation, the dull throb of sound, A pulse, a fearful pulse, in air or underground? Closer, quicker, through the heat Drones, insists, the incessant beat. Round in shuddering circle comes Beat on frenzied beat of drums, Nearer in from every side Thudding, madly multiplied, To seize the heart and blind the brain With a monotone insane. Terrible, terrible in continuance, It holds me fastened in a trance. O for a spirit that is not mine, to bear This weight of the unfathomable night! O for a spirit of more than mortal might To take upon him this my load Of infinitely wide world-quivering fear! O for a Demon or a God In saving presence to appear! What is it that my eyes amid the gloom divine There in the furtive filterings of the ghast moonshine? What bodies sway and cry and to the ground incline? The fear that held me falls apart, But leaves a horror in my heart. Stony, stony, of blank stone, Fixt on that secret altar-throne, Inhuman human Shape, with hands on knees, With remote stare that nothing, nothing sees, Yet is a magnet to a thousand eyes, A thousand forms that crouch, scenting the scent of blood, Beat breasts and writhe before you with ejected cries,— Unbrothered beast, abominable God! Who made you, and shaped you into more than breath Can give a will to? What power drove the hand With terror strong as lust, to shape you there Immovable as Death, And carve the rock of darkness in the mind To horrible resemblance of my kind? Lost Light, sunken Light! From what I am, save me! The fever-beat of sound is in my veins. I breathe the black, blood-smelling air. The ecstasy of fear, the blind throb in the breast, I share it, I must share. It is not I, I cry; Yet it is I. These are the powers that crave me; This is the full dominion of the Night. The victims, ah, the victims shriek and die: And on them the eternal Idol stares. But they have made him incense of their prayers, Voluptuously have knelt before their own Black terror, bodied into stone. Not the expiring cry So lacerates my mind, while without end Through ages up the altar-fumes ascend, And fading into shadow, from their bodies rent, Stream spirits without number to conceive,— But this, O victims, this, that you consent, That you believe! They were all human. My heart falters: how That infinite bond refuse? Like last reverberations of a bell That in their ebb and last expiry tell Of stupefying clamour, when it heaved And shook its tower to the foundation,—now Whispers out of the dark accuse, accuse: I have consented, I have believed. I.3 There is singing of brooks in the shadow, and high in a stainless Solitude of the East Ineffable colour ascends like a spirit awaking: Slowly Earth is released. It is dawn, it is dawn, the light is budding and breaking. Earth is released, flowing out from the void of the darkness Into body and bloom; Flowing out from the nameless immensity, night, where she waited Myriad forms to resume, Gloriously moulded, as if in her freshness created. The lineaments of the hills, serene in their order, Arise, and the trees With their motionless fountains of foliage, perfect in slumber; And by lovely degrees The blades of the grass re-appear, minute without number. The rounded rock glistens and warms, where the water slips by it, Familiar of old. The tree stretches up to the air its intimate branches Bathing in gold; And the dew-dazzle colours in fire the lichen it blanches. Each is seen in its beauty of difference, deeply companioned, Leaf, root, and the stone, And drawn by the light from their dream in earth's prison, emerging Distinct in their own Form, from the formless a million natures are urging. I see them, I know them, I name them, I share in their being; I am not betrayed: I feel in my fibre the touch of a spirit that knows me; For this was I made; In a world of delight and of wonder my senses enclose me. Whence come they, the water-brooks? Out of the mountainous darkness, Where no life is seen, From caverns of night are they come, but because of their springing Meadows laugh to be green; And hearing the voice of their carol, the children go singing. The children go singing, they read in the books of the Light Things hidden from the sage. Unschooled are their bodies, that run like a ripple and fear not Coming of grief and age: The sighs of the night, the doubt in the shadow, they hear not. Lo, single mid grasses a flower upspringing before me In delicate poise Takes the light like a kiss from an innocent mouth, as it quivers Confiding its joys To the air, and my heart from its prison of self it delivers. I stand in the dew and the radiance, my shadow behind me, Lost out of thought. The bright beams ascend, and ascending, from earth they uncover The secret they sought. Enter me; make me afresh, O Light, my lover! I.4 Why are these beams so twined with sweetness and with pain, Injury and anger, fear, and all desire, Whose purity should stream through pulse and brain Not thickened in dull fume or frayed with fire But absolute and whole Into the central soul Disclouded from those lures and all their train, Knowing what is and is not; white and bare As the bathed body quit of day's disguise? But the only truth is coloured with the secret stain Of our mortality, that unaware Infects the farthest vision of the eyes And region of invisible thought: Vain, vain That throbbing search! The Light Is more profound, more secret than the Night. Who has built an airy mansion for the unresting mind To inhabit and rejoicing contemplate,— A many-pillared universe, designed In order clear, complete and intricate, Intelligible wonder, not Too vast to hold man's lot,— But he has waked on some malignant morn to find The certainty, too certain to be true, Distasted, and that palace only a maze Wherein he wanders and is still confined, The pillars of it fallen, and no clue, But through the ruin penetrates a blaze Of glory beyond glory and of light behind The light: and the strength fails in him; he knows Himself lost in a world that overflows. Yet no power stills the ache or stops the springing need. The dark creative spiritual Desire Seizes upon his heart which holds that seed And straightway, till the last of breath expire, Like tool upon the wheel Sharpened the more to feel, He counts all else waste,—honour, wealth, a weed: The burden of the beauty is too great, The eternal mystery in the heart a wound, Until his vision in the end be freed, Until he has spent his all to incarnate An airy spirit upon earthly ground,— Forms for a God to dwell in and exceed This fading flesh. Alas! from godlike shapes Some yet diviner essence still escapes. O that the form which once kindled to ecstasy The rapt gazer, and freed him, should become A cold thing to appraise with leisure's eye, A beauty disinherited and dumb! Whither is the spirit flown From the forsaken stone That seemed our sunken selves to deify? O that the thought, the word, which into the heart leapt Pregnant with light and troubling even to tears, Should fade and wither, should grow old and dry, By repetition dulled upon the ears Like cheapened courtesies the lips accept, And falsehood, custom cares not to deny; A scumm'd and stirless pool, a frozen rut, A path deserted, a door shut. But that the life should be less living than the dead, This is the worst; that perfect form and word Should perish of perfection, yet be fed With incense still, and duteously adored; A name prostrate the throng The presence moved among Unrecognized; neglected and forsaken bled! Time's treachery sleeks and glozes to our use The bright eternal bareness: dearer grows To mortals what is mortal, comforted Mid alteration rather to keep truce With the ancestral darkness than oppose Too arduous scrutiny: by dreams we are led Content: to pleasure us, our truth decays. The God departs, the Idol stays. II.1. I have heard voices under the early stars Where, among hills, the cold roads glimmer white,— Voices of shadows passing, each to the other, Clear in the airy stillness Call their familiar greeting and Good-night. Were they not come as guests to a remembered room, Those words, surrounded by the befriending silence? But words, ah, words—who can tell what they are made of, Or how inscrutably shaped to colour and bloom? Sharp odours they breathe, and bitter and sweet and strong, Born from exultation, endurance, and desire; Flying from mind to mind, to bud a thought again, Spring, and in endless birth their wizard power prolong. There was a voice on a sun-shafted stair That sang; I heard it singing: The very trees seemed listening to their roots Out in the sunshine, and like drops in light The words rained on the grasses greenly springing. Ah, lovely living words, what have we done to you? Each infant thought a soul exulting to be born Into a body, a breath breathed from the lips, a word Dancing, tingling, pulsing, a body fresh as dew! Once in the bonds of use manacled and confined How have we made you labour, thinned from beauty and strength, Dulled with our dullness, starved to the apathy of a serf, Outcast in streets, abandoned foundlings of the mind! Yet once, in stillness of night's stillest hour, Words from the page I read Rose like a spirit to embrace my spirit. Their radiant secret shook me: earth was new; And I throbbed, like one wakened from the dead. O swift words, words like flames, proud as a victor's eye, Words armed and terrible, storming the heart, sending Waves of love, and fear, and accusation over Peoples,—kindling, changing! Alas, but can you die, Hardened to wither round the thought wherein you grew? Become as the blind leading with slow shuffle the blind, Heavy like senseless stones the savage kneels before? O shamed, O victim words, what have we done to you? II.2 The Presses are awake. Under the midnight cloud, Mid labyrinthine silence of the spectral streets, Sound upon darkness beats, A pulse, quivering aloud Insanely, as if a fever throbbed in stone, As if a demon plied in palpitating gloom The hurry of his loom To weave that tissue, white for an instant, then Populated with words, shadows of thought and act, Death, birth, fear, madness, joy, disaster, packed Headlong into a medley, a monotone Indifferently echoing alike Laughter and the moan of men! In the avaricious gloom a secret Ear Sucks with a whirlpool greed out of the skies Words, voiceless words, drawn in from far and near, Bubble-blown rumour, whisperings like spies, The knife-stab in the night, the fall of thrones, Alarm of nations like a beating bell, Jubilant feat, and misery grey, Caught from all corners of the air pell-mell In a voice that no man owns, That a multitude of brazen masks shall shout To the multitudes of Day. The few stars, solitary in heights of night Thieved by the cloud, shine and are dimmed again, Though none puts out their light. So solitary in the heart is pain, Solitary the Dream, Solitary the Vow, solitary the Deed! There is no room for these In that invisible cloud, woven of things that seem, Sure of accepting softness and the greed That it shall cling to and make cheaply wise,— An all-uniting web of lies and of half-lies And lying silences. Into my ear, remote, remote, is blown Out of the darkness and across the seas Sound of a forest falling, young bodies of trees One by one falling prone, To be tamed to a helpless tissue, and to feed The insatiate Presses' need. Oh, did they spring to scent the blue silence of air And sway slow to the wind, launching the light-winged birds? Ghosts only are there, The ghosts of trees that shoot no fresh leaf any more But, drones of darkness, in the midnight bear Black myriads of words. Invisibly the night thickens with words that glide Driven thronging on blind errands, soon to fall Into a million minds, and glorified To be their momentary oracle, Glitter, and then—they are like the innumerable snow Chance-timed, indifferent, random, swift and slow That falls to a stillness out of whirling flurry; And workers heavy-eyed That under the chill cloud of morning hurry, Muffled against the shiver in the blood, Soil it at every stride, Till each articulate crystal whiteness is confused, And where the moment's wonder shone is mud, Trodden, stale, and used. II.3 Hewn and heavy, of granite hewn Heavy and hard, the walls ascend Bare, without measure to the eye: Indifferent to night or noon, Over pavement they impend. Locked, impassive, huge, the Door Stands caverned in the midst: on high, Ruled and squared, the lintel stone Bears the carven Janitor, Justice, blind upon her throne. Her no praying hands implore: To her bound eyes no eyes plead. Reason's idol, calm she sits, Weighing only the gross deed, Scrupulous with mind unsoiled Not to know the thoughts that bleed In the dumb soul, fluttering, beating Hither, thither in its cage Of ancestral ignorance foiled, Rushing blinded into rage And its own desire defeating. Behind the door, within the wall Locked, they sit, the numbered ones, Secret from each other, all Lost to name, like spectres passed From the region of the sun's Changeful glory on young limbs Free to dance and free to leap. From the acted thought they fast: Them a roof of silence dims. The midnight stars move over them; They move not; but ruled times they keep With the shadows on the floor. They are mortised in a scheme, Where the walls and fastened door, Built of words that are become Stones, are like their spirits dumb. In ripened rustle of the corn The wind becomes a flowing flame; As swift it curves and slow relents The body of a wave is born. It passes—whither? No one knows; But in the vision that consents It is the beauty it became. The wind blows and the spirit blows, No moment ever yet the same, And fresher than a sparkling spring The unrepeated beauty flows; And in the child that claps his hands To see the daisy on the green, And in the young man where he stands Poised for the naked plunge; and in The invisible bursting of the bud, The leafing of the bough, that sends Lightness like laughter through the blood Of dancing girls, its wave is seen; It flows and sings and never ends! And flowers, trembling heavenly hues In a lonely mountain place, And chiming water's liquid curve, The torrent's white, rock-ruffled race Freed for splendour of its swerve, And clouds that steal the solemn blues Of noon, unregioned in their trace, Or, ghostly travellers, invade The mountains they dissolve in dream; And mazes of the stars that fade At dawn, still moving, lost in light;— All, all the threads of music bind Together in the visioned mind: Eternity has imaged them. O lovely is their secret Law Timing all their motions true. They know it not, yet they obey Without thought and without awe, Of that fountain unaware Which they spring from and renew, Finding out their missioned way, Everywhere, oh, everywhere! It is wild as a wild rose And fearful as the weltering wave. It is courage to the brave, Wisdom to the eye that knows. But we have bound it as with cords, We have built it into stone, All its motions frozen stark Round a hidden human moan. We have made it old and dark Out of maiming thought and fears, And the things our fears forbid, Out of self-hurt and of rue. We have built it into words, And the words are stones! We did What we could not help but do,— We, the eternal Prisoners. Break the word and free the thought! Break the thought and free the thing! But who in any net has caught The wind, or in a sieve the spring? As soon shall he dissever these, Through which the life-blood single streams From germ unknown to fruit unguessed, Nourished with wonder and with dreams, In its deep essence unpossessed And smiling out of mysteries. The flower is in the bud, the bud Within the seed, beneath the ground. But all is flowing of one flood That is not seen, that is not bound. This palace-prison of the mind How in the youthful morn it glows! Its windows flame with angel-light, Auroral flushes of the rose, And all the airs of heaven invite With miracle of breathing blue And shifting glory of sun and showers To ecstasy and song,—and who Remembers how therein confined In sunken cells are captive powers, Powers that a jailer fetters close With chains of the invisible hours, To one another hardly known In furtive glimpse, and each alone? O marvel of the world, O bright And luminous palace, built to hold The light of heaven within its walls Precious with glory as of gold, Why comes the night, why comes the night, When, as about it the sky falls Filled with the dark, it seems to stand A dark tower in a lonely land! II.4 In the wonder of dreams on a wave of the sky buoyed My body was the body of a wish, the word of a thought Uttered whole from a throb of the heart in a cry's delight. Never bird out of Africa beating a golden void, Shifting the coloured regions that Spring has caught, Pursued the desire of its being in flight Happier: Time an idle ruin gleamed Where vision flamed or flowered or streamed. Slow, slow the mind gropes back to curb and term Of this strange world; to Time that's used, and all The enclosing, age-descended ritual, The invisible garment, cobweb-fine and firm, Wherein the limbs move to the ancestral call, And hands repeat what dead hands did before, And the mind lingers as behind a door. The hinted glory of liberty is fled, And in its stead Is only the shadow of Man's ancient nurse, Dear Custom, at whose knees he learnt the ways Of his uncounted tribe, schooled to rehearse Cruelty and folly, and, ere he comprehend, Make these his virtue, so to earn her praise. Massive as mountain to his childish gaze Is that unmoved authority of power, His fibre trembles to offend. And slow as the Earth is in her seasons, she Befriends and punishes like sun and shower; Well-used to tears and the heart-broken hour, Smoulder of mutiny and anger, tamed in the end, Indulgent of a laughter brief as those, For all come back at night-fall to her knee, When the old shadows descend. With mutter upon her lips, with eyes half blind, Buried mysteries she knows. With dark fountains of ignorance in her mind, How wise she seems, amassed in ancient certitudes! Her silences, how comfortably kind! The human slowly grows Inhuman, where she broods. And if a solitary spirit would wrest His wrongs away from what so closely cleaves, And break into the world that he believes, Betrayers from within, crying Traitor! seek To pull him back, securely weak, In passiveness: he sucked it from her breast. O away and away and afar from this alien home, Where spirits are woven together in words of fear, Released into innocence let me have being and breath! But is it alone by mercy of dreams that I roam, Liberated to joy's essential sphere, In an antechamber of birth or beyond death? All flushes around me and then dissolves away. The heavenly dawning closes gray. II.5 Once, only once, never again, never, The idle curve my hand traces in air, The first flush on the cloud, lost in the morning's height, Meeting of the eyes and tremble of delight, Before the heart is aware Gone! to return, never again, never! Futurity flows toward me, all things come Smooth-flowing, and ere this pulse beat they are bound In fixity that no repenting power can free; They are with Egypt and with Nineveh, Cold as a grave in the ground; And still, undated, all things toward me come. Why is all strange? Why do I not grow used? The ripple upon the stream that nothing stays, The bough above, in glory of warm light waving slow, Trouble me, enchant me, as with the stream I flow Lost into the endless days. Why is all strange? Why do I not grow used? Eternity! Where heard I that still word? Like one that, moving through a foreign street, Has felt upon him bent from far some earnest look, Yet sees not whence, and feigns that he mistook, I marvel at my own heart-beat. Eternity! how learnt I that far word? III.1 Not for pity and pardon, for Judgment now I cry! To be seen, that I may see; known, that I may know, For this I cry. Dwelling among dear images dream-created, Flattered or daunted by a deluding mirror That is not I,— O to taste the light as my body tastes the air, Let fall defence, cast off the obstinately excusing Pleas, and myself be my only vindication! Nothing but this in the end can satisfy. Why does this desire pursue me and so possess me? Is not breath sweet, and the young smile of the morning? Yet inly to know That I am bound in a net of minutes and of hours, Inheriting bondages of habit, and fear, And ancient woe; To be rooted so deep in lost ages of time, With tendrils of hope and want and frail repining, The ignorant accomplice of purposes abhorred: This thought is my companion and my foe. Sometimes to fly to some remoteness of the air To perceive with different senses, a new body, I pine and ache; As on this bed of self, whereon I am bound, I toss Day and night, filled with ineffectual longing That bond to break. O yet, enslaved, I know not to what I am enslaved: Only this husk and shard of what I am, this fond Dreamer of dreams, eater and drinker of untruth, This only I know, and this cannot forsake. Wondrous glories crowd into the eye's treasure-chamber, Wondrous harmonies linger in the ear's recesses, Stored for delight. But beyond the ear's compass what modulations fine Tremble, and what marvels unapprehended sparkle Beyond the sight! Oh, and beyond the mind's capacity of conceiving, Much less of measuring, amplitudes of wisdom, Fit to sustain eternal serenity and courage, While we go clouded, faltering, finite! Were I stationed in the sun, to behold the worlds Not nightly in declension but in dance triumphant And timeless rolled; Had I the vision, closed to the eye's horizon, Labyrinths of an unimagined minuteness In the mind to hold; Could I attain the greatest and assume the least, Shrink to be a blade of the innumerable grass, Soar eagle-winged amid the altitudes of noontide, Then might I measure, and what I am behold. But rained over with riches of hours and moments, Meshing me as a lily, thick with honeyed light, The drunken bee; Intoxicated with wild sweetnesses of sense, Fullness of the opened heart, glory of earth, and beauty Enamouring me,— Roofed in a den I am, a poor captive rather Who sits in fetters eyeing the barred, the precious blue, Where high in the envied air a cloud lingers in light And wings fly whither they desire to be. Lying in the night I hear from graves unnumbered, Under stars that have seen all history passing, The indignant cry: Must we only in effigy and phantom be remembered, Malignly obscured or mocked with gilded pretences, Wherefrom we fly? Will none unwind these cerements? none lift up from us This load of false praise and false fortune's betrayal? Let us be known in nakedness of our nature! Deliver us from dominion of the lie! As if they wandered in deserts and groped in caves, I hear the exclaiming of disenchanted spirits In bitter lament Beholding the barren things for which they wasted The world, the pitiable causes whereon their breath And blood were spent! Was this the Light, this little candle at noon? This loathed Cruelty, the righteousness for which they thirsted, Sacrificing to invisible idols of the mind? They see. But who hears? This world is content. Perfect Experience! Is not the mind worthy This, when for glimpses only and shining fragments The martyrs bled? Majesty and splendour of overcoming vision, Vision all-judging, certain and universal, Not this I dread, But to remain banished into a parcelled being, Eternized in all these faculties of error! Better a perfect oblivion in Earth's vastness, By that eternal ignorance comforted. Yet does my heart not cease from its supplication, Yet I remember and cannot be satisfied, By Time oppressed. And, as if summoned and drawn whither I know not, Clinging into earth with strong fibres of nature, In dark unrest I burn like a seed that in burial forgotten Pushes its hope up, growing in blind affiance Toward the light shining over an unconceived world, There to be lost, illumined and released. III.2 In my dream there was a Door. Dark on my musing path it stood Before me, and straightway I knew (The certainty ran through my blood) That, did I open and pass through, I should know all for evermore. Those slow hinges, and that weight Relenting on them, would unroll The hidden map of all my fate And all the world and the world's soul. Who has trembled not at doors? Motionless, they shake the heart. Hope and menace on them hang: They are the closed lips' counterpart Wherein the sentence is concealed For leaping joy or lancing pang. Ah, what answer will they yield? Will it be barren as the shores That endless waves beat, like a knell Slowly repeated to Time's end? Or will it be the ineffable Still radiance that shall all amend, Melting out Time's ancient stain? Will they open on sunrise Everlasting, or will they Close upon the light again, Like eyelids closing over eyes That see for the last time the day? Is it not by such ancient dread Inspired,—the warning doubt of what Our prospering spirits has full-fed With certainties by hope begot— That on his progress proud we raise For the returning conqueror The arch, the immaterial door, So he may pass, amid the blaze And loud acclaim at glory's height, Beneath a shadow of the night, Where the hinted powers take toll Of what is mortal in the soul? O Door, like sealed fatal decree, Image of death, image of birth, Ever uncertain certainty! O silence as of silent earth, O silence into substance built, O night projected into day, O still unspoken Yea or Nay, O brimming vessel still unspilt, O end that meets us on the way! What lies behind your blank accost? Is it the treasure we have lost And laboured wearily to recover? Or something that we never knew,— Another mind with other measures Laughing to scorn our pangs and pleasures? Is it at last the only true, The unknown Love, the unknown Lover? With all my soul at earnest gaze Fixed upon that silent Door, I stretched my hand the latch to raise, I lifted up my hand, and then Some power forbade me, and I forbore. In the changes of my dream I was borne to a far place Empty and wide, and all a-gleam With sunlit quivering of the grass. There rose before me, vast and blind, A towered prison, walled and old; It seemed a prison-house so great It could have held all human-kind. In the midst there was a gate. And as I dreamed my dream, behold I saw the prisoners released. The gates rolled back; and forth they came Stumbling in the light that smote Full on them from the dazzling East. Like knives it stabbed them; like a flame It seared them; with their hands they hid Their faces, or as if by rote Stretched out vain arms, to touch and feel Familiar walls closing around; Then, lacking fetters, halted lame Waiting to do what they were bid. Their helpless motions made as though They would run back, or fall, or kneel Or hide themselves beneath the ground. This way and that they looked to go. O never may I see again Such looks of blank and empty pain! They were looks of men betrayed And of their naked souls afraid. But some there were, a few, that stood And stretched their arms up to the sun, As if the light streamed through their blood, As if their breath was now begun; As if their spirits till then had slept, As if they never yet had known The world of life that was their own. These it was, not those, who wept. Was it for pity of all that sad Throng, or the extreme joy they had? O that on earth I could have sight Of those faces, and that light! III.3 I am laid within a place of summer leaves. Solid boles mount through foliage out of sight. No shadow lacks some intimacy of light, No penetrating radiance but receives Shadowy immersion. Dream Is on me, is on the hushed, the thronged and drowsing glow. Even the thoughts emerging from the mind, Like voices in a sleeping city, seem Reproved. This is old Earth, so old and kind, That she is lenient in her overflow To all things human. Why, why tease the sense For a hope to a fear unmated? Why rend the rich seam of experience? Why toss upon thoughts frustrated? Each way appears a closing avenue, Leading, among warm scents, I know not where. But Whither is to the idle mind no care, For always there is fragrance of some clue Neglected, that might guide As in a trance the veiled soul to its unknown peace: Peace such as comes like lips laid upon lips, A brimmed oblivion of all else beside; Like anchorage to tempest-blinded ships When the thwart waves resign, and the winds cease. Earth with warm arms embrace me, and let me feel, Feel only, a wonder working, Until the tender and still sense reveal The secrets round me lurking. Now might you come back, old divinities, Earth-born, from cradling green and lost recess, Serene in your unclouded nakedness, To enrich the mirror of my musing eyes. As fruit on the rough bough Globes itself, the last golden glory of the tree, Smooth from wild earth the human image rose; And what diviner shape should hear the vow Of mortals, or what else their secret knows, Though past the ache of our mortality? Shall I not sacrifice unrest and fume On an altar here secluded? Let the vext mind re-open like a bloom Upon which the light has brooded? Delay me from the sight that only sees!— Frost of a dawn disclosing the world bare, And, stript of splendour, all things as they are, When stiffened grasses and stark branches freeze And the mind shrinks apart With all the living colours famished out of it. O kindly mediation, interpose Images of those forms that hold the heart, Warm, wondrous forms whereinto the world flows To bloom and to perfect them: O admit Certitude to obscurity awhile, As cloud in the light suspended. Gracious is Earth; not far her secret smile: And here is the soul befriended. Only such sorrow as lingered in the gaze Of Proserpine, returning from the dark, Such tears as filled her, listening to the lark And looking on the flower that springs and sways,— All humanized for her As even the shadows were, when she was throned in night; No more than these, to enhance the glowing day Shall enter where the green leaves are astir! Shall I not be sufficed, and charm away Perplexities to soft and shadowy flight? Shall I not now—O whence is this breath come Of Time in a stealing chillness? Why cries my heart out? Why are all things dumb, And strange, strange the stillness? III.4 Whisper to me, whisper! I have listened and have not heard. Whisper to me, you leaves; have you not more to say? Now at the ebb of the low evening ray Whisper some word left over from the day, The one word, the lost word!— So I cried; and then was stilled. For suddenly, unsought, unwilled, I knew not how, I knew not whence, There came a lightening of the sense; I found an answer from within, That made me to the stars akin; My pulse obeyed the lovely Law; With ears I heard, with eyes I saw; And one leaf, veined with green, indwelling light Seemed the world's secret and absorbed me quite. Eternity through a moment Sparkled; I could not turn away my sight. What thing, long contemplated, alters not Its seeming substance, as the deepening mind By contemplation passes out of thought, Immenser worlds to find? The Mother as she clasps her infant boy, Bent over him with the deep looks of joy, Becomes her own hope; oh, she stays Not with the idol of her gaze, But she is gone beyond her farthest prayer And Time's last injury, to meet him there. All that distracts him from her bosom now,— White butterflies, a waving bough— Presages the usurping world: she grows To something more than fear and hope forebode, Wide as the sky. He goes Out of her heart's possession; Yet in her arms he lies, that stranger and that God. Free on its wings the mind can hover, worlds away, To where the vast Atlantic stream Dwindles to a watery gleam, And like a star in bright noonday The body's home is lost. The mind can tell me that these mossed Gray boulders in green shadow deep, Appearing sunk and socketed in sleep, Beneath their image of repose Are all a dizzy motion whirled, A streaming dust our sight so gross Confuses to a solid world. Never mortal eye has seen Those minim motes, no thought can lodge between, So restless in their secret fever They dance invisibly for ever. Alone the soul has knowledge of release; Only in the soul is stillness, Poised to receive a universe in peace. Only in the soul is stillness! I remember an hour,— It was the May-month and wild throats were singing From bough to bough that breathed in bud and flower, And the full grass was springing Beneath an old gray tower— I remember those blue, scented airs, And how I came at unawares Beside the daisied border of a mead Upon a pool so magically clear, It made each coloured pebble and furry weed And star-grained sand within its depth appear Like things of Paradise, unearthly bright;— No surface seemed to intervene Fairy floor and eye between, Save for a traceless quivering of the light, Gentle as breathing sleep, where stole Up from its pregnant darkness The living spring, as private as the soul. Love from its inward well, a secret wonder, arising Clear as the trembling water-spring, A spirit that knows not anything, Simple in the world and nought despising, Changes all it meets,—the stone Becomes a gem, the weed a rose; But oh, within itself it grows By all it touches, all it makes its own, Vast and multitudinous, a Power To act, to kindle and to dower In pain's and fear's despite With glory of unending light. O fountain in my heart, I feel you now Full and resistless, so I nothing scorn. How could I lose you, how Ever for an hour forget you? This is the world whereinto I was born. Why did I tread long roads, seeking, seeking in vain? Why did I make lament of the dark night? Why crouch with images of old affright? Eternal Moment, hold me again, again, Bathe me in wells of light! It is now and it is here The something beyond all things dear, The miracle that has no name! When I am not, then I am: Having nothing, I have all. It was my hands that built my prison-wall, It was my thought that did my thought confine, It was my heart refrained my heart from love. Now I am stilled as in a gaze divine, Now I flow upward from my secret well, Now I behold what spirit I am of. The Body is the Word; nothing divides This blood and breath from thought ineffable. Hold me, Eternal Moment! The Idols fade: the God abides.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LONDON VISIONS NARRATIVE POEMS TRANSLATIONS LONDON VISIONS THE LITTLE DANCERS Lonely, save for a few faint stars, the sky Dreams; and lonely, below, the little street Into its gloom retires, secluded and shy. Scarcely the dumb roar enters this soft retreat; And all is dark, save where come flooding rays From a tavern-window; there, to the brisk measure Of an organ that down in an alley merrily plays, Two children, all alone and no one by, Holding their tattered frocks, thro' an airy maze Of motion lightly threaded with nimble feet Dance sedately; face to face they gaze, Their eyes shining, grave with a perfect pleasure. FEBRUARY TWILIGHT O Weariness, that writest histories On all these human faces, and O Sighs That somewhere silence hears! You have no part, It seems, in the old earth's deep-flowering heart; Your way of solace is a different way. A colour comes upon the end of day. At this street-corner, budded branches bare Trace springing lines upon the tender air; But over the far misty flush one's eye Lights at an apparition: lo, on high The little moon! as if she came all fresh Into this world, where our brief blood and flesh Is weary of burdens. She has seen all earth's Most mighty races in their ends and births, And all the glory and sorrow wrought and sung Since lips found language; and to-night is young. THE STATUES Tarry a moment, happy feet, That to the sound of laughter glide! O glad ones of the evening street, Behold what forms are at your side! You conquerors of the toilsome day Pass by with laughter, labour done; But these within their durance stay; Their travail sleeps not with the sun. They, like dim statues without end, Their patient attitudes maintain; Your triumphing bright course attend, But from your eager ways abstain. Now, if you chafe in secret thought, A moment turn from light distress, And see how Fate on these hath wrought, Who yet so deeply acquiesce. Behold them, stricken, silent, weak, The maimed, the mute, the halt, the blind, Condemned amid defeat to seek The thing which they shall never find. They haunt the shadows of your ways In masks of perishable mould: Their souls a changing flesh arrays, But they are changeless from of old. Their lips repeat an empty call, But silence wraps their thoughts around. On them, like snow, the ages fall; Time muffles all this transient sound. When Shalmaneser pitched his tent By Tigris, and his flag unfurled, And forth his summons proudly sent Into the new unconquered world; Or when with spears Cambyses rode Through Memphis and her bending slaves, Or first the Tyrian gazed abroad Upon the bright vast outer waves; When sages, star-instructed men, To the young glory of Babylon Foreknew no ending; even then Innumerable years had flown, Since first the chisel in her hand Necessity, the sculptor, took, And in her spacious meaning planned These forms, and that eternal look; These foreheads, moulded from afar, These soft, unfathomable eyes, Gazing from darkness, like a star; These lips, whose grief is to be wise. As from the mountain marble rude The growing statue rises fair, She from immortal patience hewed The limbs of ever-young despair. There is no bliss so new and dear, It hath not them far-off allured. All things that we have yet to fear They have already long endured. Nor is there any sorrow more Than hath ere now befallen these, Whose gaze is as an opening door On wild interminable seas. O Youth, run fast upon thy feet, With full joy haste thee to be filled, And out of moments brief and sweet Thou shalt a power for ages build. Does thy heart falter? Here, then, seek What strength is in thy kind! With pain Immortal bowed, these mortals weak Gentle and unsubdued remain. NARCISSUS By white St. Martin's, where the fountain shone And plashed unheard in the busy morning air, March, with rippling shadow and sudden sun, Laughing riotous round the gusty square, From frail narcissus heaped in baskets there Blew to me, as I passed, its odour keen, Keen and strange, subtle and sweet; And lo! all new and green, Spring for me had entered the stony street. THE BUILDERS Staggering slowly, and swaying Heavily at each slow foot's lift and drag, With tense eyes careless of the roar and throng That under jut and jag Of half-built wall and scaffold stream along, Six bowed men straining strong Bear, hardly lifted, a huge lintel stone. This ignorant thing and prone, Mere dumbness, blindly weighing, A brute piece of blank death, a bone Of the stark mountain, helpless and inert, Yet draws each sinew till the hot veins swell And sweat-drops upon hand and forehead start, Till with short pants the suffering heart Throbs to the throat, where fiercely hurt Crushed shoulders cannot heave; till thought and sense Are nerved and narrowed to one aim intense, One effort scarce to be supported longer! What tyrant will in man or God were stronger To summon, thrall and seize The exaction of life's uttermost resource That from the down-weighed breast and aching knees To arms lifted in pain And hands that grapple and strain Upsurges, thrusting desperate to repel The pressure and the force Of this, which neither feels, nor hears, nor sees? THE DESTROYER He stands on high in the torch-glare, With planted feet, with lifted axe. Behind, a gulf of crimsoned air; Beneath, the old wall that gapes and cracks. Tossed fragments crash to dust and smoke. Exulting life, aloft he stands And drives his unrepentant stroke, Nor heeds the havoc of his hands. Below, one lingers gazing. Why Within his heart does secret joy Quivering awaken and reply To each home-blow, Destroy, destroy? Lulled in the casual feast of sense, Awed by the ages' fortress-walls, Out of its slumber roused, intense, To the swung axe a demon calls,— Man's Demon, never satiate, That finds nought made to its desire; How shall it to this world be mate,— To a world of stone, a heart of fire! THE GOLDEN GALLERY AT SAINT PAUL'S The Golden Gallery lifts its aery crown O'er dome and pinnacle: there I leaned and gazed. Is this indeed my own familiar town, This busy dream? Beneath me spreading hazed In distance large it lay, nor nothing broke Its mapped immensity. Golden and iron-brown, The stagnant smoke Hung coiling above dense roofs and steeples dim. The river, a serpent pale, my wandering eye Lightened; but houses pressed to his silver brim. With charging clouds the sky Broad shadows threw. And now in a sudden shower A veil sweeps toward me; violent drops fall hard: Then softly the sun returns on chimney and tower, And the river flashes, barred With shadowy arches; warm the wet roofs shine, And the city is stricken with light from clouds aglow, Uplifting in dazzling line O'er valleys of ashy blue, their wrinkled snow. I leaned and gazed: but into my gazing eyes Entered a sharp desire, a strange distress. East I looked, where the foreign masts arise In rough sea-breathing reaches of broad access; And North to the hills, and South to the golden haze, But nowhere found satisfaction more. Beneath me, the populous ways Muttered; but idly vast their troubled roar Went up; I heard no longer: before me rose Pale as, at morning, mist from autumn streams, The longing of men made visible, helpless woes, Fountains of love wasted, and trampled dreams THE DRAY Huge through the darkened street The Dray comes, rolling an uneven thunder Of wheels and trampling feet; The shaken windows stare in sleepy wonder. Now through an open space, Where loitering groups about the tavern's fume Show many a sullen face And brawling figure in the lighted gloom, It moves, a shadowy force Through misery triumphant: flushed, on high Guiding his easy course, A giant sits, with indolent soft eye. He turns not, that dim crowd Of listless forms beneath him to behold; Shawled women with head bowed Flitting in hasty stealth, and children old: Calm as some conqueror Rode through old Rome, nor heeded at his heel, 'Mid the proud spoils of war, What woeful captives thronged his chariot wheel. THE RAG-PICKER In the April sun Shuffling, shapeless, bent, Cobweb-eyed, with stick Searching, one by one, Gutter-heaps, intent Wretched rags to pick. Oh, is this a man?— Man, whose spirit erect Trampling circumstance, Death and evil, can Measure worlds, nor checked By fell time and chance, With undaunted eye, With a mouth of song, Front the starry blue?— (O you passers-by, Moving swift and strong, Answer, what seek you?) Husk of manhood, mere Shrivel of his kind!— In a bloodless mask How the old eyes peer, With no light behind!— Mate of his mean task; Yet this wreckage fill With a thought, possess With a faith's empire, It shall be a will Mightier than the seas, Man, more dread than fire! A WOMAN O you that facing the mirror darkly bright In the shadowed corner, loiter shyly fond, To ask of your own sad eyes a comfort slight, Before you brave the pathless world beyond; Not first to-night invades your spirit this wild Despair, when loneliness stabs you! Turned, your face Trembles, and soft hesitation makes you a child, The child you were in some far, forgotten place, Amid things for ever rejected. Dreamed you so From the blankness of life to escape to a region enjoyed, Glowing, and strange? Yet blank to-night, I know, Spreads life, my sister; within you a deeper void. In all this city, I think, so charged with pain, None suffers more; desiring what you do With insupportable longing, and still in vain Desiring, still condemned to accept, and rue. Where tarries he, Love, the adored one? In fields unknown Roams he apart, or in sound of a pleasant stream Sleeps? Nay, dwells he in cloudy rumour alone, A name, a vision, a sweet, eluding dream? He lives, he lives, my sister; yet rarely to men He appears; they touch but his robe, and believe it is he. But soft, with inaudible feet, he is flown, nor again Comes soon; rejoicing still to be wayward and free. A moment, ev'n now, he was near you: invisible wings Brushed by you; and infinite longing, to follow, to find That vision truth, overcomes you,—the heart's sad things To tell in a trusted ear, on a bosom kind. Alas! not so he is won: when the last despair Encamps in the heart, at last when all seems vain, Then, perchance, he will steal to you unaware, And loose your tears, and understand your pain. THE STORM Stooping over London, skies convulsed With thunder moved: a rumour of storm remote Hushed them, and birds flew troubled. The gradual clouds Up from the West climbing, above the East Glowed sullen as copper embossed; against their gloom, Like ghosts astonished, thronged the steeples white. Still with absorbed hurry the streets' uproar Ran, shadowed by strange unquiet, as vaguely pursued. Lone workers from drear windows looked and sighed. Nearer drooped the sky's contracted face; The face of a Titan in punishment heavily bowed. As painful sweat, the drops fell loud: at last, With silent shivering flashes of angry flame, Long stifled, his deep thunder burst and groaned. Then crawling over, the banks of darkness broke And loosened splendour showered its arrows abroad. Now, opposite the retreating storm aghast, In full-recovered sun, new dazzling clouds, Alp beyond Alp, glitter in awful snow. Men stop in the street to wonder. The brilliance runs, Washing with silent waves the town opprest; Startles squalid rooms with a sudden smile; Enters gloomy courts, and glories there. Strange as a vision the wide expanded heavens Open; the living wind with nearness breathes On weary faces of women of many cares; They stand at their doors and watch with a soothed spirit The marvellous West asleep in endless light. THE PARALYTIC He stands where the young faces pass and throng; His blank eyes tremble in the noonday sun: He sees all life, the lovely and the strong, Before him run. Eager and swift, or grouped and loitering, they Follow their dreams, on busy errands sped, Planning delight and triumph; but all day He shakes his head. THE SLEEPERS As a swallow that sits on the roof, I gaze on the world aloof; In the silence, when men lie sleeping, I hear the noise of weeping: The tears, by Day derided, To tender Night confided. Ah, now I listen, I cannot delay In thoughts apart; I must not stay. The doors are closed and fast: unseen, With stealthy feet I glide between. I see the sleepers asleep in their beds, Negligent arms, motionless heads; Beautiful in the bloom of slumber, Peaceful armies without number. Not here I linger: the sigh of those That sleep not, draws me with answered throes. A mother mapping her day of cares, On her sleeping baby softly stares. A youth by shameful sorrow torn, Thinks on the unendurable morn. By her husband, a wife unhappy lies, With bitter heart and open eyes. An old man hears the voice of the wave, His dear son's cold unquiet grave. Alone in the lonely, listening night A child lies still in dumb affright: The burden of all dark things unknown Weighs on his trembling heart like stone. A man remembers his dead love's smile, And his tranquil courage is quelled awhile. My heart is heavy with love and pain; The tears within me oppress my brain. What shall I tell you, you that ache And number the laggard hours awake? O stabbed and stricken, what soothing art Shall I use to assuage the wounds that smart? The consolation that, ere I know Love and sorrow, I fancied true, Is faint and helpless, now I find, As beauty told in the ears of the blind: And I cannot utter in words the thought That strengthens me most, when my heart is wrought. O brother, that cannot the days undo, Could I but the reckoning pay for you! O mother, sink your head in peace, And I will your knot of care release. Dear child, give me your dread to bear: I hold your hand, I stroke your hair, It is I, who love you, that watch and keep Darkness from you, the while you sleep. I have no counsel; I know not why In your breasts the arrows burning lie; I cannot heal your hurts, nor take The sharp iron out of souls that ache. O yet, as I watch, the lashes close A little, the eyes their lids dispose; The hand that fondly lies in mine Relaxes; the wearied heads decline. And now on wings the sorrows flee From the happy sleepers, hither to me. O noiseless sorrows, darkly thronging, My heart is prepared: my tender longing You alone can appease, with tears, With pangs, with passion, with shame, with fears. Feed on my heart that is open and bare, Feed your fill, sorrow and care: Take me, pains of all souls forlorn. For O too swiftly arrives the morn MAY NIGHT Come, let us forth, and wander the rich, the murmuring night! The shy, blue dusk of summer trembles above the street; On either side uprising glimmer houses pale: But me the turbulent babble and voice of crowds delight; For me the wheels make music, the mingled cries are sweet; Motion and laughter call: we hear, we will not fail. For see, in secret vista, with soft, retiring stars, With clustered suns, that stare upon the throngs below, With pendent dazzling moons, that cast a noonday white, The full streets beckon: come, for toil has burst his bars, And idle eyes rejoice, and feet unhasting go. O let us out and wander the gay and golden night. DEPTFORD Well is it, shrouded Sun, thou spar'st no ray To illumine this sad street! A light more bare Would but discover more this bald array Of roofs dejected, window patched that stare From sordid walls: for the shy breath of Spring, Her cheek of flowers, or fragrance of her hair, Thou could'st not, save to cheated memory, bring. Alas! I welcome this dull mist, that drapes The path of the heavy sky above the street, Casting a phantom dimness on these shapes That pass, by toil disfeatured, with slow feet And with mistrustful eyes; though in the mud Children the play of ages old repeat, Because of quenchless wanting in their blood. Yet oh, what clouds of heaviness deter My spirit; what sad vacancy impedes! I am like some far-ventured traveller, Whom, in a forest vast, entangled weeds Have hindered; over whom green darkness fills The inextricable boughs and stifling feeds A poisonous fear, that sinks on him and chills. Nor finds he faith, amid the monstrous trees Rooted in silence, peopled with strange cries And stealthy shadows (where alone he sees Rank growths of the hot marsh, but watching eyes Imagines), to believe the self-same bark He leans on, lifts to the unclouded skies Its crest victorious from that cradle dark. I with like pain and languor am opprest: Me too a forest upon poison fed, Me too the marsh and the rank weeds infest. Almost I trace in the dumb pall o'erhead A net of stubborn boughs that dimly mesh The air; I stifle: like a chain of lead They weigh upon my soul, they bind my flesh. I cannot breathe: the last and worst despair Begins to invade me, numbing even desire That panted for sweet draughts of light and air. Dumb walls against me with blind heaven conspire: Incredible the sun seems now, a ghost I dreamed of in my dreams; unreal fire. The light is blotted out, the blue is lost. Was it mirage, the glow I fancied warm On human cheeks, the beauty of my kind? I feel it fading from me, a brief charm Flying at touch. Blow hither, storms of wind! Strike hither, strong sun, to my dulled heart's core! Awake, disturb me, lest mine eyes grow blind, By fatal use to a foul dream resigned, Accept for Nature's body this, her sore. RED NIGHT Rolled in a smouldering mist, wrapt in an ardent cloud, Over ridged roofs, over the buried roar That comes and goes Where shadowy London mutters at the core Of meeting streets interminably ploughed Through blackness built and steepled and immense With felt, unfeatured, waste magnificence, The night shudders and glows. Ensanguined skies, that lower and lift and change Each instant! sullen with a spectral rose Upon the towered horizon; but more near A lurid vapour, throbbing up the gloom, Glares like a furnace fume; Exhausted pallors hover faint and strange; Dull fiery flushes melt and reappear; While over all in lofty glimpses far Spaces of silence and blue dream disclose The still eye of a star. Muffled in burning air, so dumb Above this monstrous ever-trembling hum, What hide you, heavens? What sombre presences, What powers pass over? What dim-legioned host, What peopled pageantries, With gleam of arms and robes that crimsoned trail, In silent triumph or huge mockery hail? O, is it the tumultuous-memoried ghost Of some lost city, fabulous and frail, Stoops over London; Susa, Thebes, or Tyre, Rebuilded out of mist and fire? No, rather to its secret self revealed The soul of London burning in the skies Her desolations and her majesties! There, there is all unsealed: Terror and hope, ecstasy and despair Their apparition yield, While still through kindled street and shadowy square The faces pass, the uncounted faces crowd,— Rages, lamentings, joys, in masks of flesh concealed. Down a grimed lane, around a bare-benched room, Seven shapes of men are sunken, heads upon hands bowed. —O spent and mad desires, lost in the fiery cloud, What dungeon fled you from? Across the river's glittering gloom, Under the towered chimes, a youth steps, bright With dream that all the future clothes, Into this new, enchanted land. Incessant stream the faces into light! From his wife's hand Behold a drunkard snatch the toil-earned pence, And strike her on the patient face with oaths. But over trees, upon a balcony, To a young girl life murmurs up immense Its strange delight, And in her pulses to her spirit sings. Along an alley thronged and flaring A woman's loud self-loathing laughter rings. The old prowler leers. Fierce cries a mob incense. (Still the red Night her stormy heart is baring.) A bent blind beggar taps along the stones. The indifferent traffic roars and drones. Blank under a high torch Gapes a house-ruin, propped with beams; beneath Some shadow-guarded and neglected porch A girl and boy (Whence flowered, O Night, yon soft and fearful rose?) Press timid lips and breathe, Speechless, their joy. Hither and thither goes The homeless outcast; students turn the page By lamplight; the physician sentences; Dull-eyed or jovial, tavern-loungers drink; The applauded actor steps upon the stage; Mothers with far thoughts watch upon their knees Where children slumber; revellers stamp and shout; Long-parted bosoms meet in sobbed embrace; Hope, behind doors, ebbs from the waiting face; Locked bodies sway and swell With pain of unendurable farewell: No instant, but some debt of terror's paid, Some shame exacted, measureless love poured out, Weak hearts are helped, strong men are torn, Wild sorrow in dear arms is comforted, The last peace dawns upon the newly dead, And in hushed rooms is heard wail of the newly born. What ferments rise and mingle, Night, on your cloudy mirror! what young fire Shoots, and what endless lassitudes expire! Yet out of one flesh wrought, None separate, none single! Hater and hated, seeker and sought, O restless, O innumerable shapes, Kneaded by one all-urging thought, That none diverts, that none escapes; So thirsted for, if not in pride, in shame, If not with tenderness, with railing curse, If not with hands that cherish, hands that maim, Life, how vast! Life, how brief! Eternally wooed and wooing, That some would stifle, and some hotly seize, And some by cunning trap into their mesh, Or plunder in the darkness like a thief; And these from rapturous pangs of flesh Would crush to maddening wine, and these In still renunciation lure to their soul's ease. Though never in a single heart contained, Though depth of it no wisest seer may plumb, Though height of it no hero wholly gained, Heavenly and human, twined in all our throes Of passion that in blind heat overflows To charge the night with thick and shuddering fume, And felt in every cry, in every deed Defaced or freed, Ah, spent at such a dear and cruel cost,— Possessed a moment, and then, like yon height Of stars, clouded in our own selves and lost,— Lives the supreme Reality, diviner than all dream. Now all the heaven like a huge smithy glows, Hollow and palpitating dusk and glare! Ah, forge of God, where blows The blast of an incredible flame, what might Shapes to what uses there Each obdurate iron or molten fiery part Of the one infinite wrought human heart, In tears, love, anger, beauty and despair Throbbing for ever, under the red night? THE BATHERS Hither, from thirsty day And stifling labour and the street's hot glare, To twilight shut away Beyond the soft roar, under hovering trees, Hither the gleeful multitudes repair, And by the open, echoing, evening shore, On the dim grass, to the faint freshened breeze, With laughter their delighted bodies bare. Peaceful above the sunset's burning smoke, One star and white moon lure the eastern night. Already tasting of that wished delight The great elms stir their boughs, As from the day's hot languor they awoke. But the gliding cool of water whispering calls The bathers, in soft-plunging falls, To overtake its ripple with swift stroke, Or, pillowing their upward faces, drowse On undulation of an easy peace; Miraculous release Of heavy spirits, laving all desire With satisfaction and with joy entire. Strange now the factory's humming wheel, the cry Of tireless engines, the swift-hoisted bales Unnumbered; strange the smell of ordered wares In the shop's dimness: noonday traffic fails Out of the wave-washed ear; stiff office stool, And busy hush: and like a turbid dream, The tavern's glittering fume insensibly Ebbs with the hot race and the glutted stream Of labour, thieving the dear sands of youth. But ever closer, like sweet-tasting truth, The vivid drench, the yielding pressure cool; And like a known touch comes the fitful breeze From murmuring silence: the suspended trees Above, the wet drops that from hair and beard Run down the rippled back, are real and sweet. Warm are the breathing limbs, and the firm feet Tread lightly the firm ground, or lightly race To mirthful cries: while Evening, nearer heard And felt, a presence of invisible things Inbreathes, as to the nostril keen she brings The darkling scented freshness of the grass. O now from raiment of illusion shed The perfect body moves, rejecting care, And to mysterious liberty remits The rejoicing mind, in native pasture fed; And mates its glory with the priceless air, The universal beam, whatever fits Untamable spirits, nor is bought nor sold; Equalled with heroes old, That beautifully people the green morn Of time, and from pale marble, young and wise Gaze past our hurrying world, our triumphs worn, And our hearts trouble with their peaceful eyes. THE ESCAPE Destiny drives a crooked plough And sows a careless seed; Now through a heart she cuts, and now She helps a helpless need. To-night from London's roaring sea She brings a girl and boy; For two hearts used to misery, Opens a door of joy. Wandering from hateful homes they came, Till by this fate they meet. Then out of ashes springs a flame; Suddenly life is sweet. Together, where the city ends, And looks on Thames's stream, That under Surrey willows bends And floats into a dream, Softly in one another's ear They murmur childish speech; Love that is deeper and more dear For words it cannot reach. Above them the June night is still: Only with sighs half-heard Dark leaves above them flutter and thrill, As with their longing stirred; And by the old brick wall below Rustling, the river glides; Like their full hearts, that deeply glow, Is the swell of his full tides. To the farther shore the girl's pale brow Turns with desiring eyes: “Annie, what is it you're wishing now?” She lifts her head and sighs. “Willie, how peaceful 'tis and soft Across the water! See, The trees are sleeping, and stars aloft Beckon to you and me. I think it must be good to walk In the fields, and have no care; With trees and not with men to talk. O, Willie, take me there!” Now hand in hand up to the Night They gaze; and she looks down With large mild eyes of grave delight, The mother they have not known. Older than sorrow she appears, Yet than themselves more young; She understood their childish tears, Knew how their love was sprung. The simple perfume of the grass Comes to them like a call. Obeying in a dream they pass Along the old brick wall; By flickering lamp and shadowy door, Across the muddy creek, Warm with their joy to the heart's core, With joy afraid to speak. At last the open road they gain, And by the Bridge, that looms With giant arch and sloping chain Over the river's glooms, They pause: above, the northern skies Are pale with a furnace light. London with upcast, sleepless eyes Possesses the brief night. The wind flaps in the lamp; and hark! A noise of wheels, that come At drowsy pace; along the dark A waggon lumbers home. Slow-footed, with a weary ease, The patient horses step; The rein relaxed upon his knees, The waggoner nods asleep. “Annie, it goes the country way, 'Tis meant for me and you: It goes to fields, and trees, and hay, Come, it shall take us too!” He lifts her in his arms, as past The great wheels groaning ride, And on the straw he sets her fast, And lightly climbs beside. The waggoner nods his drowsy head, He hears no sound: awhile Softly they listen in sweet dread, Then to each other smile. Odours of dimly flowering June, The starry stillness deep, Possess their wondering spirits; soon, Like children tired, they sleep. The waggon creaks, the horses plod By hedges clearer seen, Down the familiar dusty road, And past a village green. The morning star shines in the pond: A cock crows loud, and bright The dawn springs in the sky beyond; The birds applaud the light. But on into the summer morn Beneath the gazing East, The sleepers move, serenely borne: The world for them has ceased. MIDSUMMER NOON At her window gazes over the elms A girl; she looks on the branching green; But her eyes possess unfathomed realms, Her young hand holds her dreaming chin. Drifted, the dazzling clouds ascend In indolent order, vast and slow, The great blue; softly their shadows send A clearness up from the wall below. An old man houseless, leaning alone By the tree-girt fountain, only heeds The fall of the spray in the shine of the sun, And nothing possessing, nothing needs. The square is heavy with silent bloom; The tardy wheels uncertain creep. Above in a narrow sunlit room, The widower watches his child asleep. ELEONORA DUSE AS MAGDA The theatre is still, and Duse speaks. What charm possesses all, And what a bloom let fall On parted lips, and eyes, and flushing cheeks! The flattering whisper and the trivial word No longer heard, The hearts of women listen, deeply stirred. For now to each those quivering accents seem A secret telling for her ear alone: The child sits wondering in a world foreknown, And the old nod their heads with springing tear, Confirming true that acted dream. And the soul of each to itself revealed Feels to the voice a voice reply, With a leaping wonder, a joy, a fear, It is I, it is I! But O what radiant mirror is this that dazzles me, That my dead rapture holds, That all my joy unfolds, That sets my longing free, My sighs renumbers, my old hope renews? I have lived in a sleep, I have tasted alien bread, I have spoken the speech, and worn the robes of the dead; I have buried my heart away, and none believed. But now, speak on, and my bonds untie: At last, it is I, it is I! THE CONVICT By the warm road-side, where chestnut and thorn The brightness shaded, supine, at ease, A felon, freed that morn, Lay idle, and wondered, gazing up through the trees. O strange no more to be one of a band Numbered and known; to lose the measure Of day divided and planned: To think for the morrow, to choose work or pleasure. His ear the jostling roar of the street Amazed: he felt the crowd like a load; And welcomed, refuge sweet, Deserted suburb and silent shady road. For now, with his hands habitual stones Of the pavement he touched: close to the wall He nestled, and felt to his bones The warmth, and the shadow cool on his forehead fall. And catching a leaf from the chestnut strayed, He held it, glowing green in the light, Transparent, with veins inlaid; And thrust the world and its vastness away from sight. Children from school, as they passed him, eyed His shorn temples, and whispering turned To mock him: he on his side, Abstracted, his limbs disposed to a slumber earned. A grave citizen, homeward bound, Perceived him, as negligent still he lay, And swerved askance, and frowned, And crossed to the opposite pavement and went his way. But warming him shone the indifferent noon; And chestnut and thorn on his sleeping head In the careless glory of June Scattered their delicate blossom of white and red. MARTHA A woman sat, with roses red Upon her lap before her spread, On that high bridge whose parapet Wide over turbulent Thames is set, Between the dome's far glittering crest And those famed towers that throng the west. Neglectful of the summer air That on her pale brow stirred the hair, She sat with fond and troubled look, And in her hand the roses shook. Shy to her lips a bloom she laid, Then shrank as suddenly afraid: For from the breathing crimson leaf The sweetness came to her like grief. Dropping her hands, her eyes she raised, And on the hurrying passers gazed. Two children, loitering along Amid that swift and busy throng, Their arms about each other's shoulder, The younger clinging to the older, Stopped, with their faces backward turned To her: her heart within her yearned. They were so young! She looked away: Oh, the whole earth was young to-day! The whole wide earth was laughing fair; The flashing river, the soft air, The horses proud, the voices clear Of young men, frequent cry and cheer, All these were beautiful and free, Each with its joy: Alas, but she! She started up, and bowed her head, And, gathering her roses, fled. Through dim, uncounted, silent days, She had trod deep-secluded ways; 'Mid the fierce throng of jostling lives, Whom unrelenting hunger drives, Close to the wall had stolen by, Yet could not shun calamity. Her painful thrift, her patient face, Could not the world-old debt erase; Nor gentle lips, nor feet that glide, Persuade the sudden blow aside. This morn, when she arose, her store, Trusted to others, was no more. No more avail her years of care. She must her bosom frail prepare, Exposed in her defenceless age, Against the world and fortune's rage. For bread, for bread, what must be done? She stole forth in the morning sun. I will sell flowers, she thought: this way Seemed gentler to her first dismay. Soon to the great flower-market, fair With watered leaves and scented air, She came: her seeking, timorous gaze Wandered about her in amaze. The arches hummed with cheerful sound; Buyers and sellers thronged around; Lilies in virgin slumber stirred Hardly, the gold dust brightly blurred Upon their rich illumined snow, As the soft breezes come and go. From her smooth sheath, with ardent wings, Purple and gold, the iris springs; Deep-umbered wall-flowers, dusk between The radiance and the odour keen Of jonquils, this sad woman's eyes And her o'erclouded soul surprise. But most the wine-red roses, deep In sunshine lying, warm asleep, Breathing perfume, drinking light Into their inmost bosoms bright, Seemed fathomlessly to unfold A treasure of more price than gold. Martha, o'ercome by wonder new, Into her heart the crimson drew; The colour burning on her cheek, She stood, in strange emotion weak. But she must buy. Her choice was made: Red rose upon red rose she laid, Lingering, then hastened out, with eyes Bright, and her hands about the prize, And quickened thought that nowhere aims. Soon, pausing above glittering Thames, She spreads the flowers upon her knees. Vast, many-windowed palaces Before her raised their scornful height And haughtily struck back the light. She scarcely marked them, only bent Her fond gaze on the flowers, intent To bind them in gay bunches, drest So to allure the spoiler best. But now, as her caressing hand Each odorous fresh nosegay planned, A new grief smote her to the heart: Must she from her sweet treasure part? They seemed of her own blood. O no, I cannot shame my roses so: I will get bread some other way. So she shut out all thought. The day Was radiant; and her soul, surprised To beauty, and the unsurmised Sweetness of life, itself reproved That had so little felt and loved! O now to love, if even a flower, To taste the sweet sun for an hour, Was better than the struggle vain, The dull, unprofitable pain, To find her useless body bread. Stricken with grievous joy, she fled. She fled, but soon her pace grew faint. She paused awhile, and easier went. Often, in spirits wrought, despair, Not less than joy the end of care, A lightness feigns: for all is done, And certainty at last begun. Martha, with impulse fresh recoiled From empty years, forlorn and soiled, Trembled to feel the radiant breeze Blowing from unknown living seas, And, rising eager from long fast, Drank in the wine of life at last. Now, as some lovely face went by, She noted it with yearning eye; She joyed in the exultant course Of horses, and their rushing force. At last, long wandering, she drew near Her home; then fell on her a fear, A shadow from the coming Hours. By chance a hawker, crying flowers, His barrow pushed along the street, And the dull air with scent was sweet. As on her threshold Martha stood, A sudden thought surprised her blood. Quickly she entered, and the stair Ascended: first with gentle care Cooled her tired roses: then a box Of little hoardings she unlocks, And brings her silver to the door And buys till she can buy no more. Laden she enters: the drear room Glows strangely; the transfigured gloom Flows over, prodigal in bloom. Her lonely supper now she spread; But with her eyes she banqueted. Over the roofs in solemn flame The strong beam of the sunset came, And from the floor striking a glow Burned back upon the wall; and lo! How deep, in double splendour dyed, Blushed the red roses glorified! When darkness dimmed them, Martha sighed. Yet still about the room she went Touching them, and the subtle scent Wandered into her soul, and brought All memories, yet stifled thought. As in her bed she lay, the flowers Haunted her through the midnight hours: 'Twixt her shut lids the colours crept; But wearied out, at last she slept. Next morning she awoke in dread. O mad, O sinful me! she said, What have I done? how shall this end For me? Alas, I have no friend. She strove to rise; but in her brain A drowsy magic worked like pain. She sank back in a weak amaze Upon the pillow: then her gaze Fell on the roses; she looked round, And in the spell again was bound. The deep-hued blossoms standing by With serious beauty awed her eye; Upward, inscrutable, they flamed: Of that mean fear she was ashamed. All day their fragrance in the sun Possessed her spirit: one by one, She pondered o'er them, dozing still And waking half against her will. Her body hungered, but her soul Was feasting. Gradually stole The evening shadow on her bed; She could no longer lift her head, Deep on her brain the flowers had wrought; Now in the dim twilight her thought Put trembling on a strange attire, And blossomed in fantastic fire. She stretched her hand out in the gloom: It touched upon a living bloom. Thither she turned; the deep perfume O'ercame her; nearer and more near, And now her joy is in her fear, The lily hangs, the rose inclines, With incense that her soul entwines, Her inmost soul that dares not stir. The gentle flowers have need of her. Unpitying is their rich desire— Her breath, her being they require. O, she must yield! She sinks far down, Conquered, listless, happy, down Under wells of darkness, deep Into labyrinths of sleep, Perishing in sweetness dumb, By the close enfolding bloom To a sighing phantom kissed, Like a water into mist Melting, and extinguished quite In unfathomed odorous night. At last, the brief stars paling, dawn Breathed from distant stream and lawn. The earliest bird with chirrup low Called his mates; softly and slow The flowers their languid petals part, And open to the fragrant heart. And now the first fresh beam returned; Bright through the lily's edge it burned And filled the purple rose with fire, And brightened all their green attire, And woke a shadow on the wall. But Martha slept, nor stirred at all. AUGUST In drooping leaves of the plane Hangs blue the early heat; Stirless, a delicate shade Sleeps on the parching street. I wander this listless morning By the banks of the dazzling river; On the hot stones lean, where toward me Lights from the water quiver. And clasping hands upon eyes, I plunge my thought in a dream Of days when the sharp air stung And the ice crushed cold in the stream; Vainly! on body and mind Has the tyrant sun his will: And to me, on the hot stone leaning, The city is faint and still, Is faint as listening sands, Where, awed by the heavy calm Of the desert heaven, listens, For ever alone, the palm. THE FIRE With beckoning fingers bright In heaven uplifted, from the darkness wakes, Upon a sudden, radiant Fire, And out of slumber shakes Her wild hair to the night; Bewitching all to run with hurried feet, And stand, and gaze upon her beauty dire. For her the shrinking gloom Yields, and a place prepares; An ample scene and a majestic room: Slowly the river bares His bank; above, in endless tier, Glittering out of the night the windows come To that bright summons; and at last appear, Hovering, enkindled, and unearthly clear, Steeple, and tower, and the suspended dome. But whence are these that haste So rapt? What throngs along the street that press, Raised by enchantment from the midnight waste That even now was sleeping echoless? Men without number, lured from near and far As by a world-portending star! Lo, on the bright bank without interval Faces in murmuring line, With earnest eyes that shine, Across the stream gaze ever; on the wall Faces; and dense along the bridge's side Uncounted faces; softly the wheels glide Approaching, lest they break the burning hush Of all that multitude aflush With secret strange desire. Warm in the great light, as themselves afire, Thousands are gazing, and all silently! How to the throbbing glare their hearts reply, As tossing upward a dim-sparkled plume, The beautiful swift Fury scares the sky. The stars look changed on high, And red the steeples waver from the gloom. Distantly clear over the water swells The roar: the iron stanchions dribble bright, And faltering with strong quiver to its fall, Drops, slowly rushing, the great outer wall. From lip to lip a wondering murmur goes, As crouching a dark moment o'er its prey, Swiftly again upleaps The wild flame, and exulting madly glows; The city burns in an enchanted day. Still the great throng impassioned silence keeps, Like an adoring host in ecstasy. Did ever vision of the opened sky Entrance more deeply, or did ever voice Of a just wrath more terribly rejoice? The houseless beggar gazing has forgot His hunger; happy lovers' hands relax; They look no more into each others' eyes. Wrapt in its mother's shawl The fretting child no longer cries. And that soul-piercing flame Melts out like wax The prosperous schemer's busy schemes: The reveller like a visionary gleams. An aged wandering pair lift up their heads Out of old memories; to each, to all, Time and the strong world are no more the same, But threatened, perishable, trembling, brief, Even as themselves, an instant might destroy, With all the builded weight of years and grief, All that old hope and pleasant usage dear. Glories and dooms before their eyes appear; Upon their faces joy, Within their bosoms fear! Is it that even now In all, O radiant Desolation, thou Far off prefigurest To each obscurely wounded breast The dream of what shall be? And in their hearts they see Rushing in ardent ruin out of sight With all her splendour, with her streaming robe Of seas, and her pale peoples, the vast globe A sullen ember crumble into night! TO A DERELICT O travelled far beyond unhappiness Into a dreadful peace! Why tarriest thou here? The street is bright With noon; the music of the tidal sound Of London fills the trembling air with power Flowing and freed around; No corner but is stirred With motion and with voices mingling heard, That every hour Bring thousand faces trooping into light Past thee. O hide thyself beneath the ground! Trouble not our sunshine longer, lest we see Too clearly inscribed on thee All that we fear to be What dost thou with the sun? Long since thy race was run. What spectral task employs Thy hands? The very boys That mocked thee, mock no more; they pass thee by, Like a dumb stone that cannot make reply. Yet, even as a stone Will from the turbulent sea Take voice and motion not its own, Words on thy lips mechanically stray With echoes and with gleams that fade and come Unrecognized, unknown. And as from some extinguished star The orphan ray Still vainly travels its eternal way, A light of meaning flickers from afar From what long since was dumb. Still at the accustomed place Appears thy ruined face; And in thy niche all the resounding day, 'Mid busy voices haunting motionless Thou standest; and to every loitering eye Resign'st thy history. Alas! thou also, thou that art so cold, Thou also once wert young; And once didst hang upon thy mother's breast And laugh upon thy father's knee. But now thy flesh is nearer to the mould Than the light grass,—and still thou lingerest! Woe to thee now, because thou chosest ill, Because each hour thou didst resign A little more of thy slow-ebbing will, And to the invading silence didst assent; Because to Life saying for ever Nay, To Death thou saidest Yea, Who leaves thee now engraven with defeat In this triumphal street, With all that was and is no longer thine Yielded and spent At what a priceless cost. O face of many battles, and all lost! Now all thy dues paid, Death possesses thee; But too secure To occupy his easy kingdom, spares To enforce his title; cruelly forbears, And suffers thee to languish in thy lot, In this most woeful, that thou weepest not. So in some street Stirred with the rushing feet Of life that glitters and that thunders past, An aged house, broken and doomed at last, Ere yet it vanish quite, Abandons helpless to the light Spoiled sanctuaries, filled with emptiness, Where late the weary harboured, and young fears Were cradled into peace, And sacred kisses kissed, and private tears Were dried, and true hearts hid their close delight. But now the fires are ashes, all is bare, The torn, gay paper flutters old, And a phantasmal stair Climbs into floorless chambers, and hearths cold. TRAFALGAR SQUARE Slowly the dawn a magic paleness drew From windows dim; the Pillar high in air Over dark statues and dumb fountains, threw A shadow on the solitary square. They that all night, dozing disquieted, Huddled together on the benches cold, Now shrank apart, distrustful and unfed, And by the growing radiance unconsoled. Then one, a woman, silently arose, And came to the broad fountain, brimming cool, And over the stone margin leaning close, Dipped hands and bathed her forehead in the pool. Now as the fresh drops ran upon her brow And her hands knotted up her hair, the ways Of old lost mornings came to her, and how Into her mirror she would smile and gaze. Then she was troubled; and looked down once more Into the glimmering water; and she seemed The very depth of darkness to explore, If it might yield all that she feared and dreamed. But that kind clouding mirror answered her With a soft answer; liquid mysteries Of shadow, with a pale breeze just astir, Yielded only the brightness of her eyes. It was herself; but O what magic wrought A presage round her, tender and obscure! The water without stain refused her not: In that deep vision she rejoined the pure. The dawn stole on; and from its buried place Rose in her bosom the sweet strength of youth; She, the rejected, had no more disgrace: Her opening heart drew in a different truth. She that had come past her last hope, and found Nothing beyond, and had shed no more tears, But closing with dull ashes her first wound, Had trodden into the daily dust all fears: She now began to wonder and to thrill Upon a new horizon: and the pain Of hope began to quicken and to fill The world with strangeness and desire again. O then I am not come quite to the end, She murmured, and life holds more than I knew. Somewhere by seeking I may find a friend Perhaps, and something in this world be true. Alone in this bright battle, whose fierce din Even now awakes round her defenceless lot, Without home, friend, comfort or peace within, The very stones might weep her. She weeps not: But as a plant, that under parching drouth Thirsted and drooped and daily heavier grew, Rises afresh to the soft showering south, She lifts her forehead to the sun anew. And in her spirit a still fountain springs Deeper than hunger, faith crying for life, That to her eyes an inward clearness brings, And to her heart courage for any strife. THE REFORMER Hyde Park August from a vault of hollow brass Steep upon the sullen city glares. Yellower burns the sick and parching grass, Shivering in the breath of furnace airs. Prone upon their pale, outwearied brows Miserable forms lie heavily, Cumbering the earth; untimely boughs Fallen from this world-o'ershadowing tree, London, that with every buried sun Shakes from her strong life a thousand lives, Feeds her heart with blood of hearts undone; Nourished with a million sorrows, thrives. Hither the Reformer comes; a flame Burns within his dark, enthusiast gaze. Still he thirsts to show mankind their shame, Lift and drag them from their sinful ways. Now amid the prostrate scattered throng Standing, he uplifts his earnest cry: “Wake, awake, rise up from lust and wrong, Quickly seek God's mercy ere you die! “Thunder on your hesitation hangs. God prepares your fearful punishment. Flee, while yet 'tis time, those endless pangs, Hearken, wretched sinners, and repent.” Scarce the motion of a listless arm, Scarce the uneasy lifting of a head, Answers that stern trumpet of alarm.— Still he sounds his vehement note of dread. Hand in hand three children solemn-eyed Wonder up into his face, and pass, Often turning backward, o'er the wide Hueless desert of the hazy grass. Fierce the lava-torrent of his speech Pours on those dejected souls around; Yet his words no single bosom reach, Wither and fall idle on the ground. Now at last he falters; his own thought, His own voice, is strange and far to him. The sun stares his meaning into naught; In the stillness all his fire is dim. From those miserable forms unstirred Now a mute imploring cry he hears, Like a stricken creature's, without word; O what vain voice sounds upon our ears! Powerless are thy terrors to appal. Welcome even, so we feel the less Heavy on our hearts and over all This intolerable emptiness! Empty is the earth for us, the skies Empty; only lives the brazen sun. Empty are our hearts; and if we rise, There is nothing to be sought nor won. If upon our silence thou intrude, Speak a speech that we may understand! Leave us to endure our solitude, Or reach out to us a brother's hand. Join us to this life that round us teems; Let us breathe again that common breath! Bring us sorrow, labour, terrors, dreams, Madness; but deliver us from death! WHITECHAPEL HIGH ROAD Lusty life her river pours Along a road of shining shores. The moon of August beams Mild as upon her harvest slopes; but here From man's full-breath'd abounding earth Exiled she walks, as one of alien birth, The pale, neglected foster-mother of dreams. For windows with resplendent stores Along the pavement dazzle and outstare The booths that front them; there, To the throng which loiters by in laughing streams Babble the criers: and 'mid eager sounds The flaming torches toss to the wind their hair, And ruddy in trembling waves the light Flushes cheeks of wondering boys Assembled, their lips parted and eyes bright, As the medicine-seller his magic herb expounds, Or some old man displays his painted toys. Deaf with a vacant stillness of the tomb, At intervals a road deserted gapes, Where night shrinks back into her proper gloom, Frighted by boisterous flare Of the flame, that now through a cluster of green grapes Shines wanly, or on striped apple and smooth pear Flits blushing; now on rug or carpet spread In view of the merry buyers, the rude dyes Re-crimsons, or an antic shadow throws Over the chestnut brazier's glowing eyes; And now the sleeping head Of a gipsy child in his dim corner shows, Huddled against a canvas wall, his bed An ancient sack: nor torch, nor hundred cries Awake him from his sweet profound repose. But thou, divine moon, with thine equal beam Dispensing patience, stealest unawares The thoughts of many that pass sorrowful on Else undiverted, amid the crowd alone: Embroiderest with beauties the worn theme Of trouble; to a fancied harbour calm Steerest the widow's ship of heavy cares; And on light spirits of lovers, radiant grown, Droppest an unimaginable balm. Yet me to-night thy peace rejoices less Than this warm human scene, that of rude earth Pleasantly savours, nor dissembles mirth, Nor grief nor passion: sweet to me this press Of life unnumbered, where if hard distress Be tyrant, hunger is not fed Nor misery pensioned with the ill-tasting bread Of pity; but such help as earth ordains Betwixt her creatures, bound in common pains, One from another, without prayer, obtains. IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM Shafts of light, that poured from the August sun, Glowed on long red walls of the gallery cool; Fell upon monstrous visions of ages gone, Still, smiling Sphinx, winged and bearded Bull. With burnished breast of ebon marble, queen And king regarded full, from a tranquil brain Enthroned together, conquered Time; serene In spite of wisdom, and older than ancient pain. Hither a poor woman, with sad eyes, came, And vacantly looked around. The faces vast, Their strange motionless features, touched with flame, Awed her: in humble wonder she hurried past; And shyly beneath a sombre monument sought Obscurity; into the darkest shade she crept And rested: soon, diverted awhile, her thought Returned to its own trouble. At last she slept. Not long sweet sleep alone her spirit possest. A dream seized her: a solemn and strange dream. For far from home in an unknown land, opprest By burning sun, in the noon's terrible beam She wandered; around her out of the plain arose Immense Forms, that high above her stared. Calm they seemed, and used to human woes; Silent they heard her sorrow, with ears prepared. Now like a bird, flitting with anxious wings, Imprisoned within some vast cathedral's aisles, Hither and thither she flutters: to each she brings Her prayer, and is answered only with grave smiles. Indescribably troubled, “Crush me,” she cries, “Speak, speak, or crush me!” The lips are dumb. —She woke, no longer in shadow, the sun on her eyes, And sighed, and arose, and returned to her empty home. THE THRESHOLD An Ode I walked beside full-flooding Thames to-night Westward; upon my face the sunset fell: The hour, the spacious evening, pleased me well. Buoyant the air breathed after rain, and kind To senses flattered with soft sound and light Of merry waves that leapt against the wind, Where, broadly heaving barge and boat at rest, The River came at flood; from golden skies Issuing through arches, black upon the West, To flame before the sunset's mysteries. Far off to-night as a remembered dream That different Thames, familiar as a friend, That youthful Thames, to whom his willows bend With private whisper; where my boat would come, Heaped with fresh flowers, and down the cool smooth stream Follow his green banks through the twilight home. Far from these paven shores, these haughty towers, Where wave and beam glorying together run, As though they would disown those cradling bowers, And gushed immediate from the molten sun. Dazzled I turn; and lo, the solemn East Before me comes. Soft to my eyes, yet bright, London her vastness stretches in hushed light Murmuring; wharf and terrace curve afar Past bridge and steeple, thronging, great with least, To Paul's high cross that sparkles like a star. The distant windows glitter; and high o'er them, Clouds unapproachable, illumined snows, Tinged with calm fire that blushes like a gem, As though themselves burned inwardly, repose. All things, methought, that inward glory shared, A radiant strangeness: nothing I beheld But spoke in a new tongue to me, or spelled New meanings; and within me a deep sense Of portals opening, of an hour prepared, Prophesied; and a light, transported thence, Of expectation on me also came. Glowing, the city waits what shall arrive: The steep clouds smoulder as to sudden flame They would burst forth, and the wave leaps alive. Immediately stole over me the thought Of this age ending; painful and oppressed, Its cry, entreating still-rejected rest, Echoed behind me. But I seemed to stand Beyond; and over the near threshold brought Of days to be, the air blew strong and bland. I listened; and a voice, wherein bore part Cloud, light, and wind, and water, thus began Aerial tones; a voice from the deep heart Of all things speaking to the heart of man. Say, troubled one, what sorrow is it keeps Thy spirit? Because thy latest dream is shed, Is the root sapped, and the strong branches dead? Forget'st thou that thy generations have Their seasons, and for them her due term sleeps Spring, with her buds, dreaming in Autumn's grave? Because 'twas Autumn with thee, thou sit'st mute, To the fall of the leaf consenting: yet thine eyes Cast round thee, and consider what fair fruit The full seeds bear in charge! Wake, and arise! Wake, and for blither energy remit This tedious questing in the inscrutable past, This pondering the before and after vast. O couldst thou take, like us, Time's quiet bloom, On life alone expend thy freshened wit, The burden and the joy alone resume! The mountains groan not that the streams devour With thievish tongue their ancient high estate, Nor of her pining leaf complains the flower; But thou enjoy'st not nor reject'st thy fate. Pitying thee, the Powers that on thee cast Thy destiny, 'mid labour solace sent. For veiled they keep that infinite ascent Of years, and by degrees the pathway show Up which thou mountest, deemest still the last Step won, and numbered all the stones of woe. And easily triumphant thou lean'st forth To grasp the final palm; when that eludes, As easily dejected: placid Earth Remains, a mirror for thy hundred moods. Dream-builder, for whose dreams thy lips invent Names of sweet sound, freedom and peace and truth, Upon the bright fermenting mists of youth Projecting a foredoomed reality: Happy, if gross joys could thy brain content, Or could thy faith match thy credulity; Ever inweaving Earth's plain warp with thread Of thy deep wishes, thine own heart's strong hue, The mind thy prison, thought thy narrow bed, With truth, with freedom what hast thou to do? O yet, I answered, not in vain desire Spurs us to gaze into the infinity, To dip our hands in that wide whispering sea. How shall one flower the whole wood's voices tell, Or one small sphere interpret that full choir Of orb with orb, music ineffable From all worlds mingled? Yet since our best joy Not in possession but beyond us lies, Our hearts at last, weary of earth's annoy, Only that far-off music satisfies. Name beyond names, Heart of the Eternal Life, Whom our faint thought hardly at times conceives, Who hear'st but as the oak his fluttered leaves The cry of parting spirits; who in the pang For children born rejoicest; from whose strife And travail issuing the bright worlds outsprang; If the wide thought of thee my childish grief Ever effaced, accept my manhood's vow! O sweet and insupportable, O chief And first and last of all loves, hear me now! Me, whom this living vastness once appalled, And this uproar disheartened and oppressed, Now larger thoughts enfranchise, with sweet zest Nourish, and this immensity sustains; Buoyed as a swimmer upon ocean, called From time to the eternal, my due pains Accepting, in thy bosom I repose, Of joys and griefs together make my bed, In longing to set sure against all foes My spirit freed, and with thy spirit wed. Thou, thou remainest ever in lovely power Triumphant, whom beginning never knew; 'Tis we alone that our own strength undo, 'Tis we alone that, to thy ardour lame, Often defeated, miserably deflower The joy thou gavest, quench the imparted flame, And native sweet sourly to ashes turn. O help, inspire! Us with thyself endow! Through our brief actions let thy greatness burn, As through the clouds the light is burning now! For me, since thou this hour to see thee whole Vouchsafest, no more shall my heart deny That thou proceed'st, because I fail and cry. Henceforth will I endure to walk right on Nor my bliss too much ponder, nor my dole. And since dear peace fortifies faith alone, I trust thee, and not loth resign my heart, Nor though thou shouldst betray me, wound and rend, Would my course alter, that the better part Have chosen, enduring to the unknown end. So inwardly my lifted spirit sang. And lo, that solemn joy to authorize, With answering bloom before my lifted eyes The clouds moved softly; the far western fires A moment o'er the steeples paused and sprang. Now on the eye the fading light expires. But 'tis to me as if Earth cast off Day, Assuming her own glory, and her flight Unwearied urging on the eternal way, Already glowed among the lamps of Night. THE ROAD MENDERS How solitary gleams the lamplit street Waiting the far-off morn! How softly from the unresting city blows The murmur borne Down this deserted way! Dim loiterers pass home with stealthy feet. Now only, sudden at their interval, The lofty chimes awaken and let fall Deep thrills of ordered sound; Subsiding echoes gradually drowned In a great stillness, that creeps up around, And darkly grows Profounder over all Like a strong frost, hushing a stormy day. But who is this, that by the brazier red Encamped in his rude hut, With many a sack about his shoulder spread Watches with eyes unshut? The burning brazier flushes his old face, Illumining the old thoughts in his eyes. Surely the Night doth to her secrecies Admit him, and the watching stars attune To their high patience, who so lightly seems To bear the weight of many thousand dreams (Dark hosts around him sleeping numberless); He surely hath unbuilt all walls of thought To reach an air-wide wisdom, past access Of us, who labour in the noisy noon, The noon that knows him not. For lo, at last the gloom slowly retreats, And swiftly, like an army, comes the Day, All bright and loud through the awakened streets Sending a cheerful hum. And he has stolen away. Now, with the morning shining round them, come Young men, and strip their coats And loose the shirts about their throats, And lightly up their ponderous hammers lift, Each in his turn descending swift With triple strokes that answer and begin Duly, and quiver in repeated change, Marrying the eager echoes that weave in A music clear and strange. But pausing soon, each lays his hammer down And deeply breathing bares His chest, stalwart and brown, To the sunny airs. Laughing one to another, limber hand On limber hip, flushed in a group they stand, And now untired renew their ringing toil. The sun stands high, and ever a fresh throng Comes murmuring; but that eddying turmoil Leaves many a loiterer, prosperous or unfed, On easy or unhappy ways At idle gaze, Charmed in the sunshine and the rhythm enthralling, As of unwearied Fates, for ever young, That on the anvil of necessity From measureless desire and quivering fear, With musical sure lifting and downfalling Of arm and hammer driven perpetually, Beat out in obscure span The fiery destiny of man. NOVEMBER Together we laughed and talked in the warm-lit room: Out now, alone I come Into the street, in the fall of the early night. Shadowy skies, with a pale uncertain gloom, Hover above the houses dim; but bright In wetness mirrored far, Retreating lamps outshine the lingering light. Hazily blue the air, heavy with dews The wind; and before me the cries and the crowd, And the sleepless murmur of wheels; not loud, For a magical softness all imbrues. The softness estranges my sense: I see and I hear, But know 'tis a vision intangible, shapes that seem. All is unreal; the sound of the falling of feet, Coming figures, and far-off hum of the street; A dream, the gliding hurry, the endless lights, Houses and sky, a dream, a dream! THE MOTHER The Mother to her brooding breast Her shrouded baby closely holds, A stationary shadow, drest In shadow, falling folds on folds. With gesture motionless as Night She stands; through wavering glare and sound Deep pierces like a sombre light The full gloom of her gaze profound. THE TOY-SELLER The Toy-seller his idle wares Carefully ranges, side by side; With coveting soft earnest airs The children linger, open-eyed. His haunted soul from far away Looks in the lamplight absently: They see not him, O happy they! He sees not them, O woeful he! THE BIRCH TREE Touched with beauty, I stand still and gaze In the autumn twilight. Yellow leaves and brown The grass enriching, gleam, or waver down From lime and elm: far-glimmering through the haze The quiet lamps in order twinkle; dumb And fair the park lies; faint the city's hum. And I regret not June's impassioned prime, When her deep lilies banqueted the air, And this now ruined, then so fragrant lime Cooled with clear green the heavy noon's high glare; Nor flushed carnations, breathing hot July; Nor April's thrush in the blithest songs of the year, With brown bloom on the elms and dazzling sky; So strange a charm there lingers in this austere Resigning month, yielding to what must be. Yet most, O delicate birch, I envy thee, Child among trees! with silvery slender limbs And purple sprays of drooping hair. Night dims The grass; the great elms darken; no birds sing. At last I sigh for the warmth and the fragrance flown. But thou in the leafless twilight shinest alone, Awaiting in ignorant trust the certain spring. FOG Magically awakened to a strange, brown night The streets lie cold. A hush of heavy gloom Dulls the noise of the wheels to a murmur dead: Near and sudden the passing figures loom; And out of darkness steep on startled sight The topless walls in apparition emerge. Nothing revealing but their own thin flames, The rayless lamps burn faint and bleared and red: Link-boys' cries, and the shuffle of horses led, Pierce the thick air; and like a distant dirge, Melancholy horns wail from the shrouded Thames. Long the blind morning hooded the dumb town; Till lo! in an instant winds arose, and the air Lifted: at once, from a cold and spectral sky Appears the sun, and laughs in mockery down On groping travellers far from where they deem, In unconjectured roads; the dwindled stream Of traffic in slow confusion crawling by: The baffled hive of helpless man laid bare. MOTHER OF EXILES What far-off trouble steals In soft-blown drifts of glimmering rain? What is it the wind feels, What sighing of what old home-seeking pain Among the hurried footsteps and the wheels, The living low continual roar Of night and London? What is it comes near, Felt like a blind man's touch along the wall Questing, and strange, like fear, Lets a lone silence 'mid the turmoil fall, Makes the long street seem vaster than before, And the tall lamp, above dim passers-by, Gleam solitary as on an ocean shore. Ships on far tracks are stemming through the night; South, east and west by foreign stars they steer; Another half-world in the sun lies bright; The darkness and the wind are here. And now the rare late footfall scarce is heard, But the wind cries along the emptied street. In cowering lamp-light flicker the fine drops To vanish wildly blurred; A hunted sky flies over the housetops. Importunate gusts beat Shaking the windows, knocking at the doors As with phantasmal hands, A crying as of spirits from far shores And the bright under-lands, Seeking one place That is to each eternal in the hue, The light, the shadow of some certain hour, One pang-like moment, years cannot efface. O infinite remoteness, near and new! O corner where friend parted from his friend! O door of the first kiss, the last embrace! O day when all was possible, O end Irrevocable! O dream-feet that pace One street, dear to the dead! O London stones, that glimmer in the rain, With bliss, with pain, have you not also bled? JOHN WINTER What ails John Winter, that so oft Silent he sits apart? The neighbours cast their looks on him; But deep he hides his heart. In Deptford streets the houses small Huddle forlorn together. Whether the wind blow or be still, 'Tis soiled and sorry weather. But over these dim roofs arise Tall masts of ocean ships, Whenever John Winter looked on them The salt blew on his lips. He cannot pace the street about, But they stand before his eyes! The more he shuns them, the more proud And beautiful they rise. He turns his head, but in his ear The steady Trade-winds run, And in his eye the endless waves Ride on into the sun. His little boy at evening said, Now tell us, Dad, a tale Of naked men that shoot with bows, Tell of the spouting whale! He told old tales, his eyes were bright, His wife looked up to see And smiled on him: but in the midst He ended suddenly. He bade them each good-night, and kissed And held them to his breast. They wondered and were still, to feel Their lips so fondly pressed. He sat absorbed in silent gloom. His wife lifted her head From sewing, and stole up to him. What ails you, John? she said. He spoke no word. A silent tear Fell softly down her cheek. She knelt beside him, and his hand Was on her forehead meek. But even as his tender touch Her dumb distress consoled, The mighty waves danced in his eyes And through the silence rolled. There fell a soft November night, Restless with gusts that shook The chimneys, and beat wildly down The flames in the chimney nook. John Winter lay beside his wife. 'Twas past the mid of night. Softly he rose, and in dead hush Stood stealthily upright. Softly he came where slept his boys, And kissed them in their bed. One stretched his arms out in his sleep: At that he turned his head. And now he bent above his wife. She slept a sleep serene. Her patient soul was in the peace Of breathing slumber seen. At last he kissed one aching kiss, Then shrank again in dread, And from his own home guiltily And like a thief he fled. But now with darkness and the wind He breathes a breath more free, And walks with calmer step like one Who goes with destiny. And see, before him the great masts Tower with all their spars Black on the dimness, soaring bold Among the mazy stars. In stormy rushings through the air Wild scents the darkness filled, And with a fierce forgetfulness His drinking nostril thrilled. He hasted with quick feet, he hugged The wildness to his breast, As one who goes the only way To set his heart at rest. When morning glimmered, a great ship Dropt gliding down the shore. John Winter coiled the anchor ropes Among his mates once more. SONGS OF THE WORLD UNBORN Songs of the world unborn Swelling within me, a shoot from the heart of Spring, As I walk the ample teeming street This tranquil and misty morn, What is it to me you sing? My body warm, my brain clear, Unreasoning joy possesses my soul complete; The keen air mettles my blood, And the pavement rings to my feet. O houses erect and vast, O steeples proud, That soar serenely aloof, Vistas of railing and roof, Dim-seen in the delicate shroud of the frosty air, You are built but of shadow and cloud, I will come with the wind and blow, You shall melt, to be seen no longer, O phantoms fair. Embattled city, trampler of dreams, So long deluding, thou shalt delude no more; The trembling heart thou haughtily spurnest, But thou from a dream art sprung, From a far-off vision of yore, To a dream, to a dream returnest. Time, the tarrier, Time the unshunnable, Stealing with patient rivers the mountainous lands, Or in turbulent fire upheaving, Who shifts for ever the sands, Who gently breaks the unbreakable barrier, Year upon year into broadening silence weaving, Time, O mighty and mightily peopled city, Time is busy with thee. Behold, the tall tower moulders in air, The staunch beam crumbles to earth, Pinnacles falter and fall, And the immemorial wall Melts, as a cloud is melted under the sun. Nor these alone, but alas, Things of diviner birth, Glories of men and women strong and fair, They too, alas, perpetually undone! As the green apparition of leaves Buds out in the smile of May; As the red leaf smoulders away, That frozen Earth receives; In all thy happy, in all thy desolate places, They spring, they glide, Unnumbered blooming and fading faces! O what shall abide? Aching desire, mutinous longing, Love, the divine rebel, the challenge of all, Faith, that the doubters doubted and wept her fall, To an empty sepulchre thronging: These, the sap of the earth, Irresistibly sprung, In the blood of heroes running sweet, In the dream of the dreamers ever young, Supplanting the solid and vast delusions, Hearten the heart of the wronged to endure defeat, The forward-gazing eyes of the old sustain, Mighty in perishing youth, and in endless birth, These remain. THE SUPPER A rich youth invites a chance company of guests from the street—a blind beggar, a sandwich-man, a tramp, two women, and a thief, all fallen in the world: they are seated at supper in a sumptuous room. Host Linger not, linger not, lift your glasses. Mirth shall come, as misery passes. Hark, how the mad wind blows his horn And hunts the laggards in streets forlorn! Hark, how fierce the winter rain Beats and streams on the window pane! Ill is it now for the houseless head, And for him that makes on the ground his bed. But we will forget in the warmth of the fire, And be glad, and taste of our heart's desire. Laugh old care and trouble down And toils and sad remembrance drown! All is yours; all sorrow bury To-night, and with me for an hour be merry. Madge You are kind, sir. Host O believe you not That it makes my joy to cheer your lot? You see me, who have lived my days In riches, pleasure, friendship, praise. I was not happy, I wanted more; To-day I have found what I missed before. I have sought you and brought you from cold and rain; Now I will raise you out of your pain. And you, old man, shall be young with me, Brisk and glad as you used to be; And you, child, with your cheeks so white, Shall feel fresh blood in your pulse to-night. Linger not, linger not, eat your fill, Drink and be merry. All We will, we will! Blind Roger Set the glass in my hand. I'm blind and old, But still I shun to be left in the cold. Host Is it hard at the first to remember the way Of mirth, and be rid of the load of the day? Oh, be not afraid to laugh and to smile. Averill Our lips, it may be, are slow awhile, And our hearts unused to gaiety yet. But let us forget. Tony Ay, let us forget. Michael That's easy, mates; but that's the least. Now we're set to so rare a feast, I'm ripe and ready for all gay cheer. But the great wax lights, so soft and clear, Abash me, and make my eyes afraid. Host Wait but a moment, the dazzle will fade: Soon to your eyes will the light be as bloom, And your ears be filled with the peace of the room. Were the wind but quiet, instead of the toil And the traffic beneath, with its huge turmoil, You'd fancy the lonely fields around. Annie 'Tis soft and calm, but I miss the sound. Averill Oh, it is sweet for an hour to be lulled, For an hour to be happy with senses dulled. Tony Ah, ah, the silver, how it gleams! I have seen such glitterings in my dreams. Roger Long, long ago, when my eyes could see, Such sweet odours used to be. Michael What a fruit is this to melt in the mouth! Host I have a garden in the South. It brings me summer warm in frost, Glories fallen and odours lost. I love fresh roses in the snow; I love them best when the leaves are low. Annie What wonderful colours are these that burn In the red flower blushing beneath the fern. Madge How cold are your hands, lass! Host Come to the fire. Come, let us heap the bright coal higher. Now the sparks fly. Michael The fire is good; The blessed red flames warm my blood. Better this than the stars I saw Shine last night, where I lay on the straw, Through a chink in the roof of the mouldering shed. Ha, ha! I thought it a famous bed, And slept like a prince in his palace till day, When the cursing farmer drove me away. Tony Once I sat in as fine a room; The host was away, but we were at home; We drank his health in his own red wine. 'Twas midnight when we sat to dine: We filled our bellies, and slept for a spin. And softly we laughed as the dawn came in. Michael Now we are merrier, now for a song. O for some music to bear it along. Roger I once could sing my song with the best; I rolled my voice up out of my chest. But the sap is dried in my bones: so you, That have voice and blood and all things new, Sing; with the burden we'll all come in. Host Moisten your mouth then, ere you begin. I pledge you, friends. Your health! and yours! Michael May you be merry while breath endures. Tony May you be merry, whatever befall. Annie Good luck! Madge Good luck! Host Good luck to you all! Michael [singing] Wander with me, wander with me: Care to the devil, be free, be free! Who but a fool would scrape and save, To heap up a molehill and live in a grave? Roger [quavering] Wander with me, wander with me! Michael I saw the old landlord, the miser gray, Gather his greedy rents to-day. The old gray rat with fiery eyes, He stamped with his stick and he snuffed for a prize. Lord, how the starveling tenants shivered, And into his ravening claws delivered. Death pulls at his foot with a right good will; But he fleshes his teeth with a relish still. What prayers and excuses! I laughed to hear. I that owed nothing, had nothing to fear. Madge O men are cruel! I've seen them go And turn folks houseless into the snow. Michael [singing] What rent pay I to the air and the sun? The days and the nights are mine, every one; When I've finished with one, there's another begun. Wander with me, wander with me, Care to the devil, be free, be free! All Wander with me, wander with me! Michael Yes, I tell you, sir, I tell you, my friend, I drink your good luck, but be sure of the end. You never can tell you won't come to the cold, And the bed from under your body be sold. You smile at your ease; you pay no heed; You think to lay hands on all that you need, And still you go piling your riches high; But where is the use of it all, say I? Host Well said, my friend: you've a heart in your breast; And a brave heart beating is worth all the rest. Where is the use of it all? 'Tis true: But we walk in the way we're accustomed to. Michael He with his riches, he dares not believe me! With banquets and couches he thinks to deceive me. Give me a glass of the bright stuff there; And you, that sit so straight in your chair, What are you thinking so sadly of, yonder, You dreamer of dreams? To be merry and wander Over the world, is it wiser, say, Than to sit and grow fat and let life slip away, Till your blood turns chill and your hair turns gray? Averill I think I have wandered the whole earth round, An endless errand, nowhere bound. I look straight, and nothing see In the world, and no man looks on me. What have I with men to do? I hear them laugh, as I pass them through In the street; I feel them stop and stare At the boards that over my shoulder flare. What matters my ragged and grimy coat, My aching back, my parching throat? I am a beacon to laughter and leisure; I point all day the path to pleasure! [A pause Madge How strange we look in the mirror tall! It casts a brightness about us all. Here are we round a table set, And until this night we had never met! Roger Your mirth soon flags. When I was young, We'd have been merry the whole night long. Michael Ay, mates, we're wasting our pleasure. Drink! We came not here to be sad and to think. Madge 'Tis all day toiling that clouds the head. Host What do you do for daily bread? Madge I sell my matches along the street. I see the young with nimble feet, The fair and the foolish, the feeble and old, That crawl along in the mire and the cold: And the sound is always in my ears. O the long, long crowding, trampling years, Since I was young and followed after The lights, the faces, the glee, the laughter! But now I watch them hurry and pass As I see you all now, there in the glass. Annie, so pale? What ails you, lass? Annie I am faint, I am tired; but soon 'twill go— On the pavement I never felt it so; All is so strange here, I am afraid. Host Afraid? What grief, my girl, has made Such foolish fears come into your thought? We are all friends: and friends or not, None should harm you within these doors. Outside is the world that raves and roars. But you, I marvel how you, so slight, Endure alone so vast a fight. Annie I know not how, but down in the street 'Tis not so heavy a task to meet. A power beyond me bears me along, The faint with the eager, the weak with the strong. 'Tis like an army with marching sound: I march, and my feet forget the ground. I have no thought, no wish, no fear; And the others are brave for me. But here, I know not why, I long to rest; I have an aching in my breast. O I am tired! how sweet 'twould be To yield, and to struggle no more, and be free! Michael Courage, lass, hold up your head; Never give in till it's time to be dead. Host Nay, rest, if you will. Yet taste this wine, The cordial juice of a golden vine. 'Twill cheer your spirit, 'tis ripe and good, And it goes like sunshine into the blood. Madge Eat this fruit, too, that looks so rich, So smooth and rosy. Is it a peach? 'Tis soft as the cheek of a child, I swear. Annie [absently] As the cheek of a child? Michael Come, never despair— But the sad man, what is he mumbling there? Averill To the lost, to the fresh, To the sweet, to the vain, Turn again, Time, And bring me again. I feel it from afar Like the scent of a leaf; I see and I hear; It is joy, it is grief. What have we done With our youth? with the flowers, With the breeze, with the sun, With the dream that was ours? Our thoughts that blossomed Young and wet! What have we drunken Quite to forget? Where have we buried Our dead delight? We could not endure it; It shone too bright. O it comes over me Keener than pain. All is yet possible Once, once again! [A silence Annie [starting up] What am I doing? Eating and drinking! I strangle, I choke With the pain of my thinking. He wants me, he cries for me, Somewhere, my boy, My baby, my own one joy. They said 'twas a sin to have borne him: My sin was to desert him. He that hung at my breast and trusted me, How had I heart to hurt him? I must go, through the night, through the cold, through the rain, I must seek, I must toil, till I find him again. Host Stay, stay! Madge O Annie, how can you bear To tell your shame, where all can hear? Annie I wish that I were lying In my love's arms again. My body to him was precious As now it is worthless and vain. What matters to me what you say? Let me go. But you, O why did you wake my woe? I wanted not feasting, nor mirth, nor wine, Nor the things that I know shall never be mine, I wanted only to sleep and forget. Host She's gone. Madge The night's wild. Averill Wild and wet! Tony Hark, how the wind in the chimney hums. Averill It beats and threatens like distant drums. Host Come to the fire. Fill once more Your glasses. Michael It is not now as before. The good drink tastes no longer well. Madge I am full of fears that I cannot tell. Why am I weak and lonely and old? Roger Where is it gone? I seemed to behold For a moment, but now, the blessed light. Alas, again it is black, black night! Tony I once was loved by a lass, I see Her smile, I hear her calling to me. Could I feel her kiss on my mouth again— Roger O could I see for a moment plain! Michael I had a friend, he was dearer than brother, I loved him as I loved none other. I struck him in drink; he left me for ever. I shall grasp his hand again never, never! Averill What have you done to us? Why have you brought All sad thoughts that ever we thought, And this evil spell around us cast? Madge We were all merry a moment past. Host What will you have, friends? What shall I do For your comfort? What shall I give to you? Averill My youth! Roger My sight! Tony My love! Michael My friend! Madge O make me sure of peace in the end. Host I gave you freely of all I had, It is not my doing, you are not glad. Averill We want. Tony We hunger. Averill Ah, once more Let us hope, let us love, let us live. Michael Restore What we have lost, what you possess, You that are stronger for our distress, You that have wakened our hearts this day. Host My friend, you know not what you say. Roger [in a low voice] Why did he ask us hither to-night? Madge And question, too, of our evil plight? Tony Why did he drive us to be glad? Roger To make us remember what once we had. Madge Youth and happiness well forgot! Tony To spy on our trouble. Michael A devil's plot! Damn the poison! Drink no more! I wish I had split my glass on the floor Ere I made merry with him. His guest! To watch us befooled, 'twas an excellent jest! Roger I wish I could see his face. Michael He stands, Pale and angry, with twitching hands. O his sport is spoiled; he's vext to know That we've found him out. Madge Let us go, let us go. Michael Ay, we've our pride, as well as he. Come out to the street, in the street we are free. Tony Curse the light that dazzled our eyes! Michael Curse the drink that taught us lies! Madge Say no more, but let's begone. Roger Curse the mocker that lured us on! Michael May your pleasure perish, your grief increase, Your heart dry up. Averill [breaking in] Peace, friends, peace. Host [astonished, and struggling with himself] Ungrateful! Averill You know not, sir, perchance, How misery turns the mind askance. Host I pitied you. Averill Pity, sir, 'tis well, But it will not hold men up from hell. Silence, friends: you have had your way, Now 'tis for me to say my say. Listen well, our host: my youth Comes back; I burn with the fire of the truth. It lights my thoughts and kindles my tongue; And he must speak, whose heart is wrung. Behold us, who ask not pity, We were not what we are; For a moment now we remember: Oh, we have fallen far! We are Necessity's children. Our Mother, that bore us of old, Has her mark on us all: she brings us All, in the end, to her fold. We have wandered in meadow and sun; But she calls us up from the flowers. She is our will, our purpose; The aching flesh is ours. Hark, in the lullest tempest, Close on the wild wind's heels, The sound that makes men tremble, The sound of her chariot wheels! She calls. We must not tarry. We must take up our yoke again, With labouring feet for ever To follow her triumph's train; To follow her sleepless course, And to fall when she decrees With wailings that no man hearkens, With tramplings that no man sees, With the great world glorying round us, As the dying soldier hears, Far off in the ebb of battle, His conquering comrades' cheers. Is your heart grown tender toward us? Would you lift us up from the mire? Would you set our feet in the way To follow our far desire? Oh, you must have strength to fashion Our bones and bowels anew, With fresh blood fill these bodies, Ere we may have part with you. Farewell, for our Mother calls: We go, but we thank you, friend, Who have lifted us up for a moment, To behold our beginning and end. We are clothed with youth and riches, We are givers of feasts to-night, We spread our plenteous table And heap it in your sight. You need not to sharpen hunger; All shall be well appeased. If you find our fare to your pleasure, You shall depart well pleased. Have you tasted a relish keener Than the pang of useless pain? Know you a spice more rare Than the tears of wisdom rain? Come, eat of the mad desires That rend us we know not why, The terrors that hunt us, the torment That will not let us die. Taste, it is ripe to bursting, The sorrow-scented fruit, That weakness sowed in darkness, That found in the night its root, That blossomed in great despairs, And is trodden to earth in scorn, By the ignorant feet that trample The faces of babes unborn. The laughter of men that mock, The silence of women that fear, The shrinking of children's hands: Come taste, all these are here. Drink, drink of the blood-red wine, That the smilers and scorners have pressed From the wrongs of the helpless, the rending And sobs of the fatherless breast. We heap our table before you. Eat and be filled: we go. O friend, that had pity on us, It is we that have pity on you! Host [Alone, after a long silence, raising his head] O what furious serpent's nest Have I found in my own breast? Like flames my thoughts upon me leap, To eat my joy, to kill my sleep. How dreadful is the silence here! It weighs like terror on my ear. Soon will the dawn be shining in, And men awake, and birds begin; And I must face the world afresh. I faint, I fear it in my flesh. I thought that I could love my kind! Love is vast, and I was blind. O mighty world, my weakness spare! This love is more than I can dare. NARRATIVE POEMS NIOBE “Zeus, and ye Gods, that rule in heaven above, Is there naught holy, or to your hard hearts dear? Have ye forgotten utterly to love, Or to be kind, in that untroubled sphere? If aught ye cherish, still by that I pray, Destroy the life that ye have cursed this day! “No, ye are cold! The pains of tenderness Must tease not your enjoyed tranquillity. How should ye care to succour or to bless, Who have not sorrowed and who cannot die? Wise Gods, learn one thing from ephemeral breath; They only love, who know the face of Death. “When did ye ever come as men to earth Save to bring plagues, war, misery, to us? O vanity! We have smiled, yet know that birth Looks but to death through passions piteous; While calm ye live, and when these human seas Wail in your ears, feel deepest your own ease. “Yet envied ye my keener happiness, That ye must quench it in such triple gloom? For, by a mercy more than merciless, Slaying my children in their guiltless bloom, Me ye slew not, but suffered, as in scorn, Accurst to linger in a land forlorn. “Where are they now, those dead, that once were mine? I saw them in their beauty, I thought them fair, And in my pride dreamed they were half divine. An idle boast I made, to my despair: For in that hour they died, and I receive A fate thrice bitterer, since I live to grieve.” So, on the mountains, hapless Niobe, With feverish longing and rebellion vain, Bewailed herself, swift plunged in misery, Bewailed her children, by dread deities slain; Those jealous deities, whose bright shafts ne'er miss, Phœbus, and his stern sister, Artemis. Nine days those bodies of unhappy death Lay in their beauty, by Ismenus flood; For on sad Thebes Zeus breathed an heavy breath, And men became as marble, where they stood. Nine suns their unregarded splendour shed; And still unburied lay those lovely dead. But on the tenth day the high Gods took pity, And in the fall of evening from their seats In heaven, came down toward the silent city, The still, forsaken ways, the unechoing streets: And through the twilight heavenly faces shone. But no man marvelled; all yet slumbered on. The king sat, brooding in his shadowy halls, His counsellors ranged round him. With fixed eyes, Set brows, and steadfast gaze on the dim walls, He sat amid a kingdom's mockeries; And seemed revolving many a thought of gloom, Though his mind slept, and knew not its own doom. The Gods beheld unheeding, and went through, And came to the stream's side, where slept the dead. And while stars gathered in the lonely blue, They buried them, with haste and nothing said; Feeling, perchance, some shadow of human years, And what in heaven is nearest unto tears. So, their toil ended, the Gods passed again, Through the deep night, to pale Olympus hill, But in their passing breathed upon all men, And loosed the heavy trance that held them chill. Slowly night waned; the quiet dawn arose; And Thebes awoke to daylight and her woes. But Niobe, the mother desolate, Enduring not to see her home forlorn, To wander through the vacant halls, that late Echoed with voice and laughter all the morn, A homeless queen, went sorrowing o'er the hills, Alone with the great burden of her ills. There as she wept, a sleep was sealed on her; Yet not such sleep as can in peace forget. The strivings vain of hands that cannot stir, And swelling passion, poisoned with regret, And piercing memory, in their dark control Possess with torment her imprisoned soul. She, clouded in her marble, seeming cold, Majestically dumb, augustly calm, Yet feeling, through all bonds that round her fold, A nameless fever that can find no balm, A grief that kindles all her heart to fire, The crying of a tyrannous desire, Remains for ever mute, for ever still. Thebes marvels, gazing at the stony thing, And deems it lifeless as the barren hill, To which the winds and rains no bloom can bring: Yet under that calm front burns deeper woe Than ever Thebes, with all her hearts, can know. No hope she sees in any springtime now, But it is buried in with the autumn leaves. Yet, when day burns upon her weary brow, Deadened to her deep pain, she scarcely grieves; And, burdened with the glory of that great light, Almost forgets it brought her children night. But when the pale moon makes her splendour bare, Terrible in the beauty of cold beams, The radiance falls on the mute image there, And Niobe awakens from her dreams. Those subtle arrows search her soul, with pain Tenfold more cruel from her children's bane. Remembering their dead faces, she would sigh: But the pure marble brooks no sound of grief. She only lives to sorrow silently, And, in despair, still hope some last relief. The Gods are stern; and they to those long years Ordained an immortality of tears. 1887 PORPHYRION Book I “O from the dungeon of this flesh to break At last, and to have peace,” Porphyrion cried, Inly tormented, as with pain he toiled Before his dwelling in the Syrian noon: The desert, idly echoing, answered him. Had not the desert peace? All empty stood That region, the swept mansion of the wind. Pillars of skyey rock encompassed it Afar; there was no voice, nor any sound Of living creature, but from morn to eve Silence abounding, that o'erflowed the air And the waste sunshine, and on stone and herb The tinge and odour of neglected time. Yet into vacancy the troubled heart Brings its own fullness: and Porphyrion found The void a prison, and in the silence chains. He in the unripe fervour of sweet youth Hearing a prophet's cry, had fled from mirth And revel to assuaging solitude. He turned from soft entreaties, he unwound The arms that would have stayed him, he denied His friends, and cast the garland from his brow. Pangs of diviner hunger urged him forth Into the wild; for ever there to lose Love, hate and wrath, and fleshly tyrannies, And madness of desire: tumultuous life, Full of sweet peril, thronged with rich alarms, Dismayed his soul, too suddenly revealed: And far into the wilderness, from face And feet of men he fled, by memory fierce Pursued; till in the impenetrable hills He deemed at last to have discovered peace. Three years amid the wilderness he dwelt, In solitary, pure aspiring turned Toward the immortal Light, that all the stars Outshines, and the frail shadow of our death Consumes for ever, and sustains the sun. The voiceless days in pious order flowed, Calm as the gliding shadow of a cloud On Lebanon; morn followed after morn Like the still coming of a stream: his mind Was habited in silence, like a robe. Then gradually mutinous, quenched youth Swelled up again within him, hard to tame. For like that secret Asian wave, that drinks The ever-running rivers, and holds all In jealous wells; so had the desert drunk All his young thoughts, wishes, and idle tears, Nor any sigh returned; but in his breast Sweet yearnings, and the thousand needs that live Upon the touch of others, impulses Quick as dim buds are to the rain and light, Falterings, and leanings backward after joy, And dewy flowerings in the heart, that make Life fragrant, were all sealed and frozen up. Now, at calm evening, the just-waving boughs Of the lone tree began to trouble him: Almost he had arisen, following swift As after beckoning hands. Now every dawn At once disrobed him of tranquillity: Fever had taken him; and he was wrought Into perpetual strangeness, visited By rumours and bright hauntings from the world. And now the noon intolerable grew: The very rock, hanging about him, seemed To listen for his footfall, and the stream Commented, whispering to the rushes. Ah, The little lizard, blinking in the sun, Was spying on his soul! A terror ran Into his veins, and he cried out aloud, And heard his own voice ringing in the air, A sound to start at, echoing fearfully. He paced with fingers clenched, with knotted brow: He cast himself upon the ground, to feel His wild breast nearer the impassive earth, So far away in peace, but all in vain! And springing up he cast swift eyes around Like a sore-hunted creature that must seek A path to fly: alas, from his own thoughts What outer wilderness shall harbour him? Then after many idle purposes, And such vain wringing of the hands, as use Men slowly overtaken by despair, He sought in toil, last refuge, to forget: And he began to labour at the plot Before his rocky cell, digging the soil With patience, and the sweat was on his brow. All the lone day he toiled, until at last He rested heavy on the spade, and bowed His head upon his hands: a shadow lay Beneath him, and deep silence all around. The silence seized him. As a man who feels Some eye upon him unperceived, he turned His head in fear: and lo, a little sound Among the reeds, like laughter, mocked at him. And he discerned bright eyes in ambush hid Beyond the bushes; and he heard distinct A song, borne to him with the clapping hands Of banqueters; an old song heard afresh, That melted quivering in his heart, and woke Delicious memory: all his senses hung To listen when that voice sang to his soul: Then, fearfully aware, he shuddered back; Yet could not shake the music from his ears. He cast the spade down, with quick-beating heart, And sought that voice, whence came it; but the reeds In the soft-running stream were motionless, The bushes vacant, all the valley dumb: And clear upon the yellowed region burned Evening serene. Then his sore troubled heart With a tumultuous surging in his breast Heaved to the calm heaven in a bitter cry: “I have no strength, I have no refuge more. Father, ere thou forsake me, send me peace!” Scarce had the sun into his furnace drawn The western hills, whose molten peaks shot far Over the wide waste region fiery rays, When swiftly Night descended with her stars: And lo, upon this wrought, unhappy spirit At last out of the darkness, raining mild In precious dew upon the desert, peace Incredibly descended with the night. He stood immersed in the sweet falling hush. Over him liquid gloom quivered with stars Appearing endlessly, as each its place Remembered, and in order tranquil shone. Easily all his fever was allayed: And as a traveller strained against a storm That meets him, buffeting the mountain side, Suddenly entering a deep hollow, finds Magical ease over his nerves, and thinks He never tasted stillness till that hour; So eager he surrendered and relaxed His will, persuaded sweetly beyond hope. Tranquil at last, his solitary cell He entered, and a taper lit, that shed Upon rude arches and deep-shadowed walls A clearness, tempering all with gentle beam. Then he, that with such anguish of desire Had supplicated peace, now peace was come, Of all forgetful save of his strange joy, That dear guest in his bosom entertained; From trouble and from the stealing steps of time Sequestered; housed within a blissful mood Of contemplation, like a sacred shrine; And poured his soul out, into gratitude Released: how long, there was no tongue to tell, Nor was himself aware; no warning voice Admonished, and the great stars altered heaven Unnoted, and the hours moved over him, When on his ear and slowly into his soul Deliciously distilling, stole a sigh. O like the blossoming of peace it seemed, Or like an odour heard; or as the air Had mirrored his own yearning joy in speech, A whisper wandering out of Paradise. “Porphyrion, Porphyrion!” Like a wind Shaking a tree, that whisper shook his heart. Keen to reality enkindled now His inmost fibre was aware of all: Vast night and the unpeopled wilderness Around him silent; in that solitude Himself, and near to him a human sigh! Immediately the faint voice called again: “Thou only in this perilous wilderness Hast found a refuge; ah, for pity's sake Open! It is a woman weak and lost In this great darkness, that importunes thee.” Then with a beating heart, Porphyrion spoke. “O woman, I have made my soul a vow To look upon a human face no more.” “Yet in some corner might I rest my limbs That are so weary with much wandering, And thou be unhurt by the sight of me!” Sweet was the voice: doubting, he answered slow. “Thou troublest me. I know not who thou art That com'st so strangely, and I fear thy voice. What wouldst thou with me? Enter: but my face Seek not to meet.” Then he unclosed the door, But turned aside, and knelt apart, and strove Again to enter the sweet house of peace. Yet his heart listened, as with hurried feet The woman entered; and he heard her sigh, Like one that after peril breathes secure. Now the more fixedly he prayed; his will Was fervent to be lost in holy calm, So hardly new-recovered: but his ear Yearned for each gentle human sound, the stir Of garments, moving hand or heaving breast. Amid his prayer he questioned, who is this That wanders in this wilderness alone? And, as he thought, the faint voice came to him: “I hunger.” Then, as men do in a dream, Obeying without will, he sought and found Food from his store, and brought, and gave to her. But as he gave, he touched her on the hand: He looked at unawares, then turned away; And dared with venturing eyes to look again; And when he had looked, he could not look elsewhere. O what an unknown sweetness troubled him! He gazed: and as wine blushes through a cup Of water slowly, in sure-winding coils Of crimson, the pale solitude of his soul Was filled and flushed, and he was born anew. Instantly he forgot all his despair And anguished supplications after peace. Not peace, but to be filled with this strange joy He pined for, while that lovely miracle His eyes possessed, nor wonder wanted more. At last his breast heaved, and he found a voice. “Mystery, speak! O once again refresh My famished ear with thy sweet syllables! Thou comest from the desert night, all bloom! I fear to look away, lest thou shouldst fade. Art thou too moulded out of simple earth As I, or only visitest my sight, Deluding? Ah, Delusion, breathe again The music of thy voice into my soul!” As if a rose had sprung within his cell And magically opened odorous leaves, So felt he, as she raised her eyes on him And spoke. “Hast thou forgotten then so soon? Hast thou not vowed never again to look On face of woman or of man? Remember Ere it be lost, thy vow, thy treasured vow. O turn away thy wonder-wounded eyes, Call back thy rashly wandering looks, unsay Thy words, and this frail image from thy breast Lock harshly out! Defend thy soul with prayers, Nor hazard for a dream thy holy calm; Lest thou repent, and this joy shatter thee.” While thus she spoke, the stirring of her soul, Even as a breeze is seen upon a pool, Appeared upon her face. Like the pale flower Of darkness, the sweet moon, that dazzles first And then delights, unfolding more and more Her beauty, shining full of histories On the dark world, upon Porphyrion now She shone; and he was lifted into air Such as immortals breathe, who dwell in light Of memory beginningless, and hope Endless, and joy old and forever fresh. He heard, yet heard not, and still gazing, sighed: “Pour on, delicious Music, in my ears Thy sweetness: for I parch, I am athirst. Three years have I been vacant of all joy, Have mocked my sense with famine, and the sound Of wind and reed: but in thy voice is bliss. How am I changed, since I have looked on thee! Thou art not dream. Yet, if a vision only, Tell me not yet, suffer me still to brim My sight to overflowing, to rejoice My heart to melting, even to despair. Thou art not dream! Yet tell me what thou art, That in this desert venturest so deep?” “Seek not,” she answered, “what I am, nor whence I come; in destiny, perhaps, my hand Was stretched toward thee, and my way prepared. Only rejoice that thou didst not refuse Help to the helpless, and hast succoured me.” As the awakened earth beholds the sun, Her saviour, when his beam delivers her From icy prison, and that annual fear Of death, Porphyrion in his bosom felt Pangs of recovered ecstasy, old thoughts Made young, and sweet desires bursting his heart Like the fresh bursting of a thousand leaves. Uplifted into rapture he exclaimed: “O full of bliss, out of the empty world That comest wondrous, I will ask no more. Enough that thou art here, that I behold Thy face, and in thee mirrored all the world Created newly: Eyes, my oracles, What days, what years of wonder ye foretell! As in a dewdrop all the morning shines I see in you time glorious, grief refreshed, And Fate undone.” “Seest thou only this?” She said, and earnestly regarded him: “Art thou so eager after joy? Yet think In what a boundless wilderness of time We wander brief! Art thou so swift to taste Of thy mortality? Yet I am come To bring thee tidings out of every sea; Not pearls alone, but shipwrecks in the night Unsuccoured, and disastrous luring fires, And tossings infinite, and peril strange. O wilt thou dare embark? Dost thou not dread This ocean, in whose murmur seems delight? Will even thy hunger drive thee through the waves To bliss? I look on thee, and see the joy Rise up within thy bosom, and I fear. So fragile is this sweetness, and so vast The world: O venturous, glad voyager, Be sure of all thy courage, for I see Far off the cloud of sorrow, and bright spears, And dirges, and joy changed from what it seemed. Art thou still fervent, O impetuous one? Still hastest thou to fly tranquillity?” But he on whom she looked with those deep eyes Of bright compassion, answered undismayed: “Let me drink deep of this fountain of bliss! Speak not of mortal fear, speak not of pain: Thou painest, but with joy. Thou art all joy; And in the world I have no joy but thee. O that I had the wasted days once more Since to this idle, barren wilderness I fled, in fear of the tumultuous world, Enamoured of the silence: here I dreamed In lonely prayer to satiate my soul. But now, I want. Rain on my thirsty heart Thy charm, and by so much as was my loss By so much more enrich me. I have stript My days, imprisoned wandering desires, Made of my mind a jealous solitude, Pruned overrunning thoughts, and rooted up Delight and the vain weeds of memory, Imagining far off to capture peace. Blind fool! But O no, let me rather praise Foreseeing Fate, that kept so fast a watch Over my bliss, and of my heart prepared A wilderness to bloom with only thee!” Even now he would embrace her; but awhile She with delaying gesture stayed him still, Wistfully doubting, and perusing well His inmost gaze and his adoring heart. As from bright water on some early morn, Under a beautiful dim-branching tree, A gleam floats up among the leaves, and sends Light into darkness wavering: from the light Of his enraptured face a radiance shone Into the mystery of her eyes; at last To his warm being she resigned her soul. She on his heart inscribed for evermore Her look in that deep moment, and her love. At unawares this trembled from her lips: “O joyful spirit, I too have need of thee!” And now he seemed to fold her in his arms, And on the mouth to kiss her; close to him, Surely her swimming eyes were dim with love, Her lips against him murmured tenderly, And her cheek touched his own: yet even now, Even as her bosom swelled within his arms, As like the inmost richness of a rose Wounding, the perfume of her soul breathed up An insupportable joy into his brain, Even now, alas! faltering in ecstasy, His arms were emptied; back he sank; despair Drowned him; upon his sense the darkness closed; And with a cry, lost in a cloud, he fell. Book II Slumber these desolated senses guard With silence interposed and dimness kind; While in tumultuous ebb joy and dismay Murmur, re-gathering their surge afar. Idle thou liest, Porphyrion, and o'erthrown By violent bliss into a trance as deep: Yet even in thy trance thou takest vows, Thou burnest with a dedicated fire, And thou canst be no more what thou hast been. A rebel, thou wert in strong bonds, who now Art chosen and consenting: and prepared Is all thy path, that no more leads to peace, But to repining fever; pain so dear, It will not be assuaged. Awaiting thee Is all that Love of the deep heart requires; The ecstasy, the loss, the hope, the want, The prick of grief beneath the closed eyelid Of him whom memory visits, but not rest; The sweetness touched, for ever perishing Out of the eager hands. Invisibly Perhaps even now on thy unconscious cheek Thy Guide is gazing, and to pity moved He thy forgetful term gently extends. At last from heavily unclouding sleep Porphyrion stirs: dimly over his brain Returns the noon, and opens wide his eyes. Some moments by the veiling sense of use Delayed in wonder, troubled he starts up. Instantly he remembered; and all changed Appeared his cell, the silence and the light: She, whom his heart had need of, was not there. And eager from his dwelling he came forth, If there were sign of her. But all was still. Suspended over the forsaken land, The sun stood motionless, and palsied Time, Helpless to urge his congregated hours, Leaned heavy on the mountain: the steep noon Had all the cool shade into fire devoured. Then quailed Porphyrion. Lost was his new joy, An apparition frail as a bright flame Seen in the sun: irrevocably lost The old thoughts that so long had sheltered him. The fear, that presaging the heavy world Makes wail the newborn child, he now, a man, Thrice competent to suffer, felt afresh, To cruel truth re-born, a naked soul. Now he had eyes to see and ears to hear, And knew at last he was alone: the sky Absorbed he saw, the earth with absent face, The water murmuring only to the reeds, Unconscious rock, and sun-contented sand. And even as within him keener rose Longing unloosed, so much the heavier grew The intensity of solitude around. Melancholy had planned her palace here. Dead columns, to support the burning sky, For living senses insupportable, She made, and ample barrenness, wherein To ponder of defeated spirits, quenched Desire, o'ertaken hope, courage undone, Implored oblivion, and rejected joy: Nor this alone, but idleness so vast As even the stormiest enterprise becalmed, Till it was trivial to advance one foot Beyond the other; rashness to provoke An echo, where if ever man could laugh, Laughter had seemed the end of vanity, Were not a vanity more vain in tears. For from the blown dust to the extremest hills, Audible silence, that sustained despair, A ceiling over all immovable, Presided; and the desert, nourishing That silence, listened, jealous of a sound Younger than her unageing solitude; The desert, that was old when earth was young. Wailing into the silence, that rang back A wounded cry, to the unhearkening ear Of the austere ravines perhaps not strange, The youth in that vain region stood, and cast Hither and thither seeking, his sad eyes. Out of the dreadful light to his dim cell He fled for refuge. Here he had possessed Joy, for a brief space, here She looked on him, Here had her heart beat in her bosom close Against his own. Her voice was in his ear; And suddenly his soul was quieted. Surely the visitation of such spirits Comes not of chance, he murmured, but of truth. Surely this was the shadow of some light That shines, the odour of some flower that blooms, And far off mid the great world dwells in flesh That blissful spirit, and bears a human name. If she be far, yet have I all my days For seeking, and no other joy on earth: I will arise, and seek her through the world. With this resolve impassioned and inspired, His thoughts were bright, and his hot bosom calmed. Sweet was it to behold that radiant goal, Though far, and hazardous and wide the way. The greatness of his quest found answer in him Of greatness, and the thousand teasing cares That swarm upon perplexity, flew off. Gladly against his journey he prepared His pilgrim's need, and laid him down and slept, And ere the dawn with scrip and staff arose. Now at his door, irrevocably free, Before the unknown world, spread dim and vast, He stood and pondered, gazing forth, which way To follow, and what distant city or vale Held his desire; but pondering he was drawn Forth by some secret impulse; he obeyed, Not doubting; toward the places of his youth He turned his face, toward the high mountain slopes Of the dim west, and Antioch and the sea. Up the long valley, by the glimmering stream He went; and over him the stars grew pale. Cliffs upon either hand in darkness plunged Built up a shadow; but far off, in front, Invaded by the first uncertain beam, Mountain on mountain like a cloud arose. He seemed ascending some old Titan stair, That led up to the sky by great degrees, In the vast dawn; he journeyed eagerly, Foot keeping pace with thought; for his full heart Tarried not, but was with its happy goal, One face, one form, one vision, one desire. Due onward over the unending hills He held his way, and the warm morning sprang Behind him, and a less impatient speed Drove his feet onward. In the midday heat He rested weary; and relaxing thought, Had leisure to perceive where he had come. Burning beneath the solitary noon All round him rose, rock upon rock o'erhung, A fiery silence: undefended now By clouding grief, nor in illusion armed, He to the heavy lure all open lay That from this mortal desolation breathed. Out of his heart he sought to summon up The vision, but it fled before his thought. Only the hot blank everywhere opposed His spirit, and the silent mountain wall. Like one, on whom the fear of blindness comes, For whom the sun begins to fall from heaven, And the ground darkens, he rose up and fled, Grasping his staff; and fearful now to pause In that death-breathing region, onward ran. Yet was not peril past. He had not come Far, when his agitated eyes beheld, Amid the uneven crumbling ground, a stone Square-hewn and edgeways fallen; and he knew That he had come where men long since had been. And as he lifted up his eyes, all round Were massy granite pillars half o'erthrown, Propping the air; and yellow marble shone, Dimly inscribed, fragments of maimed renown. Over the ruined region he stole on, Threading the interrupted clue of roads That led all to oblivion, trenches choked With weed, and old mounds heaped on idle gold. And now Porphyrion paused, inhaling fast Odours of buried fame: as in a dream, All that remote dead city and her brisk streets, Repeopled and for mountain battle armed, He apprehended. The deep wave of time Subsiding, had disclosed englutted wrecks, Which now so long slept idle, that they seemed To emulate the agelessness of earth; Did not the fondness of mortality Still haunt them, and a kind of youth forlorn, As if the Desert their brief fable, man, Indulging from austerest indolence, Forbore a just disdain. Porphyrion, With beating pulses, and with running blood, Alone on ashes perishably breathed. As he who treads the uncertain lava fears Each moment that his rash foot may awaken Fire from beneath him, from that sepulchre Of smouldering ages fearfully he fled. And sometimes he looked backward, lest his feet Startle a shadowy population up In the deserted sunlight, faces stern Of fleshless kings, to claim him for their own: So frail appeared the heaving of his breath, So brief his pace, so idle his desire. At last beyond the scarred gray walls he came, And gladly found the savage rock once more Beneath him, nor yet dared to rest or pause, But onward pressed, over the winding sides Of pathless valleys, where an echoing stream Ran far below; and ridges desolate He climbed, and under precipices huge And down the infinite spread slopes made way. The eagle steering in the upper winds, As, balanced out of sight, his eye surveyed From white Palmyra to Damascus, flushed Among faint-shining streams, saw him afar Journey, a shadow never wearying From hour to hour: until at last the hills Less steep opposed him, toward the distant plains Declining in great uplands dimly rolled. Here were few stubborn trees, by sunset now With sullen glory lighted rich, till night Rose in the east, and hooded the bare world. Porphyrion had ascended a last ridge Of many, and his eyes gazed out afar On boundless country darkening; he lay down At last, full weary: the keen foreign air Filled his delighted nostril: and his heart Was soothed. As on a troubled mere at night Wind ceases, and the gentle evening brings Beauty to that vext mirror, and all fresh In perfect images the lost returns; Serenely in his bosom rose anew The vision: somewhere in that distant world, He mused, is she; and there is all my joy. But evening now before his gazing eyes Receded dim, until the whole wide earth Appeared a cloud. Then in the gloom a dread Came whispering, and hope faltered in his breast: “O if the great world be but fantasy Raised by the deep enchantment of desire, And melt before my coming like a cloud!” Parleying with the ghost of fear, yet still Cherishing his thought's treasure, he resigned His senses to the huge and empty night, When on the infinite horizon, lo! Sending a herald clearness, upward stole Tranquil and vast, over the world, the moon. Delicately as when a sculptor charms The ignorant clay to liberate his dream, Out of the yielding dark with subtle ray And imperceptible touch she moulded hill And valley, beauteous undulation mild, Inlaid with silver estuary and stream, Until her solid world created shines Before her, and the hearts of men with peace, That is not theirs, disquiets: peopled now Is her dominion; she in far-off towns Has lighted clear a long-awaited lamp For many a lover, or set an end to toil, Or terribly invokes the brazen lip Of trumpets blown to Fate, where men besieged For desperate sally buckle their bright arms. All these, that the cheered wanderer on his height In fancy sees, the lover's secret kiss, The mirth-flushed faces thronging through the streets, And ships upon the glimmering wave, and flowers In sleeping gardens, and encounters fierce, And revellers with lifted cups, and men In prison bowed, that move not for their chains, And sacred faces of the newly dead; All with a mystery of gentle light She visits, and in her deep charm includes. Book III Dawn in the ancient heavens over the earth Shone up; but in Porphyrion's bosom rose A brighter dawn: the early ray that touched His slumber, woke the new, unfathomed need, Fallen from radiant night into his soul, That thirsted still for beauty; for that joy Beyond possession, ever flying far From our dim utterance, beauty causing tears. He stretched his arms out to the golden sun, His glorious kin, impetuously glad, And with aërial morning journeyed on O'er valley and o'er hill. The second dawn Found him far-travelled over pastoral lands, Where from the shepherds' lonely huts a smoke Went up, or some white shrine gleamed on a height. Soon the dark ranging and unchanging pines Yielded to ash and chestnut; O how fair Their perishable leaf! Porphyrion knew That some great city neared him, and his pace Grew eager, climbing a soft-crested hill In expectation; yet all unprepared At last upon his eye the prospect broke, Dawning serene, and endlessly unrolled. There lay the city, there embodied hope Rose to outmatch desire: he cried aloud, Taken with joy so irresistible, That he must seize a sapling by the stem To uphold him, and in ardent silence gazed. Solitary heaven, strown with vast white clouds, Moved toward him over the abounding land; A land of showers, a land of quivering trees, A land of youth, lovely and full of sap, Upon whose border trembled the wide sea. Young were the branches round him, in fresh leaf Luminously shaded; the arriving winds Broke over him in soft aërial surge; For him the grass was glittering, the far cloud Loosened her faltering tresses of dim rain, And broad Orontes interrupted shone. But mid that radiant amphitheatre He saw but the far city: thither ran His gaze, and rested on her, in a bloom Of distant air apparelled, while his heart Beat at the thought of what she held for him. Bright Antioch! From the endless ocean wave Gliding the sunbeam broke upon her towers, A moment gleaming white, then into shade Withdrawn, until she seemed a thing of breath, Created fair, from whose far roofs arose Soft, like an exhalation, human joy. Clear as a pool to plunge in, seemed the world This blissful morn, to him that thither gazed, Wondering, until unconscious tears were wet Upon his flushing cheek, while he sent forth His eager thoughts flying to that sweet goal, And conjuring wishes waved unknown delight To come to him. Already in dream arrived, Close to his ear the hum of those far streets He hears; already sees the busy crowd Pass and repass, with laughter and with cries. Meeting him, children hand in hand from school Gleefully run, and old men, slow of step, Approach; the mason, pausing from his toil Under the plank's cool shadow, looks at him, Or, with a negligent wonder glancing down, Beautiful faces; oh, perhaps the face That to his fate he follows through the world. That deepest hope, too dear to muse upon, A moment filled him with a thrilling light: And as a bird, alighting on a reed Sprung straight and slender from a lonely stream, Some idle morning, delicately sways The mirrored stem, and sings for perfect joy; So musical, alighted young desire Upon his heart, that trembled like the reed. Down from that height, over delicious grass, Amid the rocks, amid the trees, he sped. The browsing sheep upstarted in the sun, Scared by his coming; he ran on, and tore A fresh leaf in his mouth, or sang aloud Out of his happy heart; such keen delight His eye was treasuring, that welcomed all The variable blooms in the high grass, Borage and mullein and the rust-red plume Of sorrel, and the sprinkled daisies white. Even the sap in the young bough he felt Reach warmly up to the inviting sun, As if his own blood by the spring renewed Were theirs, and budding leaves within his breast. At last, ere he perceived it, he was close Upon the city walls: through shading boughs Across a valley they rose populous With crowding towers and roofs of distant hum. Then in the midst of joy he was afraid. So close to him the richness he desired Dismayed his spirit, that to doubt and fear Recoiling fell. Not yet will I go up, He thought; but when the dark comes, I will go. Even as his purpose was relaxed, his limbs To sudden heaviness surrendered: down He laid him in sweet grass beside a pool, Under a chestnut, opposite a grove Of cypress; and at once sleep fell on him: Deep sleep, that into dark unfathomed wells Plunges the spirit, and with ignorance lost Acquaints, and inaccessible delight, And unborn beauty. But meanwhile the noon Had ripened and grown pale in the soft sky. A gentle rain fell as the light declined; And, the drops ceasing, an unprisoned beam Out of a cloud flowed trembling o'er the grove, And ran beside long shadows of the stems, And lighted the dark underleaves, and touched The sleeper: suddenly his cheek was warm: He stirred an arm, and unrelaxing, sighed; And now, through crimsoned eyelids, on his brain The full sun burned; to wonder he awoke. Green over him, in mystery o'erhung, Was dimness fluttered with a thousand rays; Unfathomable green; that living roof A single stem upbore, whose mighty swerve Upward he followed, till it branched abroad In heaven, and through the dark leaves shone remote, Smooth-molten splendour, the broad evening cloud. Porphyrion upon his elbow leaned And hearkened, for the trembling air was hushed By hundred birds, praising the peaceful light Invisibly: a wet drop from the leaf Spilled glittering on his hand. Then he reclined Deep into joy, absolved out of himself, The while the wind brought to him light attired In fragrance, and the breathing stillness seemed Music asleep, too lovely to be stirred. As thus he drew into his pining heart Such juices as make young the world, and feed The veins of spring; as into one pure sense Embodied, he was hearkening blissfully, A sound came to him wonderful, like pain, With such a sweetness edged. It was a voice, A happy voice: and toward it instantly The fibre of his flesh yearningly turned, Trembling as at a touch. Then he arose Troubled: he looked, and in the grove beyond That peaceful water, lo! a little band Of youths and maidens under distant trees Departing: one looked backward ere she went; And his heart cried within his breast, awaked Suddenly into blissful hope. Alas! With flutter of fair robes and mingled, gay, Faint laughter, down a bank out of his view They were all taken. Pierced with sudden loss, And kindled, like a wild, uncertain flame, Into a hundred joyful, wavering fears, He gazed upon the empty grove, the pool, And the light brimming over on fresh grass And lonely stems: but the bereaved bright scene No more rejoiced him. Now, to aid his wish, Swift night upon the fading west inclined: And he stole forward through the cypress gloom Toward Antioch. Halting on a neighbour brow, Afar off he beheld that company Even now under the dim gate entering in. He followed, and at last the darkened street Received him, wondering, back among his kind. Was ever haven like the dream of it In peril? or did ever feet attain Their goal, but still a richer rose beyond? It was a festal night: gay multitudes Came idly by, and no man noted him. His seeking gaze, hither and thither drawn, Roamed in a mirror of desires amazed, And found, yet wanted more than it could find. Beauty he felt around him brushing near, And joy in others seen; but all to him, Without the vision that his soul required, Was idle: solitary was his heart, And full to breaking: yet, as wounds are dulled To the frail sense, he knew not yet his grief, For wonder clothed it; through a veil he heard And saw. Thus wandering aimlessly he found His feet upon a marble stair; in face A porch rose; issuing was a festal sound, That drew him onward out of the lone night. Halting upon the threshold he gazed in. Pillars in lovely parallel sustained A roof of shadowed snow, enkindled warm From torches pedestalled in order bright; Amid whose brilliance at a banquet sat, Crowned with sweet garlands, revellers, and cups Lifted in laughing, boisterous pledge, or gazed Earnest in joy, on their proud paramours. Pages, with noiseless tripping feet, had borne The feast aside; and now the brimming wine From frosted flagons blushed, and the spread board Showed the soft cheek of apricot, or glory Of orange burning from a dusk of leaves, Cloven pomegranates, brimmed with ruby cells, Great melons, purpling to the frosty core, And mountain strawberries. Beyond, less bright, Was hung mysterious magnificence Of tapestry, where, with ever-moving feet, A golden Triumph followed banners waved O'er captive arms, and slender trumpets blew To herald a calm hero charioted. Just when a music, melted from above, Over the feasters flowed, and softly fixed The listening gaze, and stilled the idle hand, Porphyrion entered; all those faces flushed, Lights, flowers and laughter, and the trembling wine, And hushing melody, and happy fume Of the clear torches burning Indian balm, Clouded his brain with sweetness, like a waft Of perished youth returned; those wonders held His eyes, yet were as things he might not touch, And, if he stretched his hand out, they would fade. Then he remembered whom he sought. A pang Disturbed him; eager with bright eyes inspired, Through those that would have stayed his feet, he stole Nearer to bliss. They all regarded him Astonished; in their joyful throng he seemed An apparition: darkly the long hair Hung on his shoulders, and his form was frail. Some cried, then all were silent; a strange want Woke in their sated breasts, and wonder dread Troubled them, whence had come and what required This messenger unknown. But he passed on, And in each woman's face with questioning gaze, Dazzled by nearer splendour, looked, and sought, Doubtful. Already one, whose arm was laid Around the shoulder of her paramour, Stayed him, so deep into his heart she looked, Biting her pearly necklace: in her robe Was moonlight shivering over purple seas. Encountering, their spirits parleyed: then Unwillingly he drew his eyes away. Another, clothed as in the fiery bloom Of cloud at evening changing o'er the sun, Backward reclining, under lids half-closed Gazed, and a moment held him at her feet: Until at last one turned and dazzled him, Of whose attire he knew not, so her face With sun-like glory drew him: he approached; And she, presiding beauteous and adored Queen of that perfumed feast, beckoned him on. Her bosom heaved; the music from her ears Faded, and from her sated sense the glow Of empty mirth: far lovelier were in him Sorrow and youth and wonder and desire. Forward she leaned, and showed a vacant place By her, and he came near, and sat him down, Charm-stricken also, whispering, Art thou she? She said no word, but to his shining eyes Answered, and of the red pomegranate fruit Gave him to eat, and golden wine to drink, And with pale honeyed roses crowned his hair. All marvelled, and with murmur looked on him, As, high exalted over realms of joy, He sat in glory, and sweet incense breathed Of that dominion, riches in a cloud Descending, and before his feet prepared The world in bloom, and in his eyes the dream Of destiny excelled, and rushing thoughts Radiant, and beauty by his side enthroned. Book IV Love, the sweet nourishing sun of human kind, Who with unquenchable fire inhabitest Worlds, that would fall into that happy death Out of their course, were not their course so fixt; Who from the dark soil drawest up the plant, And the sweet leaves out of the naked tree; Whose ardent air to taste and to enjoy All flesh desire, even of bitter pangs Enamoured, so that this intenser breath They breathe, and one victorious moment taste Life perfect, over Fate and Time empowered; Leave him not desolate, Love, who to thy glory Is dedicated, and for thee endures To look upon the dreadful grave of joy, Knowing the lost is lost; comfort him now, Thy votary, who by the pale sea-shore In the young dawn paces uncomforted. Ah, might not sweet embraces have assuaged The fever which had burnt him, honeyed mouth And the close girdle of voluptuous arms? Nor dimly fragrant hair have curtained him From memory? Alas, too new he came From love, too recent from that ecstasy; And memory mocked him under the cold stars, With finished yet untasted pleasure sad. Flying that fragrant lure, unhappy soul, By the dark shore he paces: and his eyes The dawn delights not, far off in the east Discovering the sleeping world, and men To all their tasks arousing, while she strews Neglected roses on the unchanging hills, And over the dim earth and wave unfolds Beauty, but not the beauty he desires. To her, to her, who in the desert touched His spirit, and unsealed his eyes, and showed Above a new earth a new sun, and brought His steps forth to this perilous rich world, Stirred with ineffable deep longing now He turned; ev'n to behold her from afar, To touch the hem of her apparel, seemed Sweeter ten thousandfold than absolute Taste and possession of a lesser charm. “Where art thou?” cried he. “Ah, dost thou behold My desolation and not come to me? O ere my sick heart all delight refuse, Return, appear! Or say in what far land Thou lingerest, that I may seek thee out And find thee, without whom I have no peace Nor joy, but wander aimless in a path Barren and undetermined o'er the world. Wilt not thou make thy voice upon the wind Float hither, or in dew thy secret breathe To answer my entreaty?” The still shore Was echoless, unanswered that sad cry. Warm on the wave the Syrian morning stole. Out of suspended hazes the smooth sea Swelled into brilliance, and subsiding hushed The lonely shore with music: such a calm As vexes the full heart, inviting it, Flattered with sighing pause Porphyrion's ear. The sea hungered his spirit; he could not lift His eyes from the arriving splendour calm Of those broad waters, to their solemn chime Setting his grief; and gradually vast His longing opened to horizons wide As the round ocean; deep as the deep sea His heart, and the unbounded earth his road. That inward stream and dark necessity, Which drives us onward in the way of Time, Moved his uncertain hesitating soul Into its old course, and his feet set firm To tread their due path, seeking over earth The Wonder that made idle all things else. He raised his brow, inhaling the wide air; And the wind rose, and his resolve was set. Broad on the morrow hoisting to the sun Her sail, a ship out of the harbour stands Bearing Porphyrion, fervent to renew His lonely pilgrimage; to fate his way Committed, and to guiding beams of heaven; And careless whither bound, so the remote Irradiated circle, ever fresh, Glittering into infinity, lead on. Soon the bright water and keen kiss of the air His clouded courage cleared; uprising wind Swelled the resisting sail, and the prow felt The supple press of water, cleaving it; And the foam flashed and murmured; hope again Rose tremulous to that music's buoyant note. Day pursued day on the blue deep, and shores Sprang up and faded: still his gaze was cast Forward, and followed that undying dream. Standing at last above a harbour strange, Inland he bent, ever with questioning heart Expectant; and through wilderness and town Journeyed all summer; nor could autumn tame That urging fire; nor mid the gliding leaves Of bare December could hope fall from him. Ever a stranger roamed he, nor had thought To seek a home; for him this vast desire Was home, that fed his spirit and sheltered him From care and time and the perplexing world. For not beside an earthly hearth he deemed To find her moving whom he sought, though fair With human limbs, and clothed in lovely flesh. Rather some visitation swift and strange His soul awaited. When at evening's end He rested and each fostered secret wish Rose trembling; when the dewy yellow moon Slowly on cypress gardens poured her light, And from the flowery gloom and whispering Of leaves, a hundred odours had released, Dimly he knew that she was wandering near, A blissful presence, scarce beyond the marge Of his veiled senses, in a world of beams. Or journeying through the wild forest, he saw Her passing robe pale mid the shadowy stems A moment shine before his quickened steps To leave him in the deep forsaken gloom Pining with throbbing breast and desolate eyes; And once in the thronged market at hot noon Heard his name spoken, and looked round on air. So visited, so haunted, he was led Onward through many a city of the plain Till vaster grew the silence, and far off The noise of men; and he began to climb Pastoral hills that into mountains rose Skyward, with shelving ridges sloped between, Long days apart. And as he wound his way Thither, from crested town to town, he heard Rumours of war all round him, men in arms Saw glittering in winding files, and waved Banners, and trumpets blown. But all to him Was distant, borne from a far alien world Where men in ignorant vain deeds embroiled Lost the treasure of earth and all their soul. Onward he kept his course, nor recked of them, Riding the solitary forest ways. And now again it was the time of birth, When the young year arises in the woods From sleep, and tender leaves, and the first flower. Old thoughts were stirring in Porphyrion's breast, And old desires, like old wounds, flowed anew. It was that hour of hesitating spring When with expanded buds and widened heaven The heart swells into sadness, wanting joy More ample, and unnumbered longings reach Into a void, as tendrils into air. O now as never seemed he to have need Of his beloved, to be with her at last, To see her and embrace her with his arms, And in her bosom find perpetual peace. Scarcely aware of the bright leaves around His path, and heedless of his way, he rode With bridle slack and forward absent eyes, When piercing his deep dream a groaning cry Smote on him; he stayed still and from his horse Dismounted, and the rough briar pushed aside. Hard by the path, amid the trodden grass And bloody brambles, lay a wounded man. “Friend, fetch me water,” groaned he, “for I die. The spring is near, and I have crawled thus far But get no farther, struggle how I may.” Quickly Porphyrion ran to where the spring Gushed bubbling, and fetched water, and came back. The dying man drank deep, and having drunk Half rose upon his arm, and eager asked: “How went the battle? have we won or lost? I know not whether thou be friend or foe, But quick, tell me! I faint.” “What sayest thou Of battles?” said Porphyrion; “I know not Of what thou speakest, and I fight for none.” Faintly the other with upbraiding eyes Regarding him, made answer. “Art thou young And is the blood warm in thy body, and yet Thou wanderest idle? But perhaps thy hand Knows not the sword, nor thou the ways of men?” Then kindled at his heart Porphyrion spoke. “I have no need of fighting, yet my hand Knows the sword, and my youth was trained in arms.” “Take then this blade, and bind my armour on. For over yonder hill I think even now They fight; there is our camp; ah, bid them come And bury Orophernes where he fell!” Even with the word he sank back and expired, Youthful amid the soft green leaves of spring, That over his pale cheek and purple lips Waved shadowing. Nearer than his inmost thought Was then the silence to Porphyrion's heart, As heavily he rode, bearing the sword For token, and the helmet on his brows. He sought for his old thoughts and found them not. Even as when the sudden thunder breaks A brooding sky, and the air chills, and strange The altered landscape shines in a cold light, And they that loitered hasten on, and oft Shiver in the untimely falling eve, So now on this irruption of the world Followed a sadness, and his thoughts were changed And yearning chilled. How idle seemed his hope, How infinite his quest! Before his mind Life spread deserted, vacant as a mist. So mournful rode he; when beyond a hill, Whose height, with hanging forest interposed, Shut off the sun, he came into the light Over against a valley broad that sloped Before him; and at once burst on him full All the glory of war and sounding arms. He thought no more, but gazed and gazed again. Dark in the middle of the plain beneath An army moved against a city towered Upon a distant eminence: even now From the gate issued troops, with others joined New-come to aid them, and together ranked Stood to encounter stern the foes' assault. These upon either wing had clouded horse In squadrons, chafing like a river curbed By the firm wind that meets it; crest and hoof Shone restless as the white wind-thwarted waves. Lonely and loud a sudden trumpet blew; And fierce a score of brazen throats replied. The sound redoubled in Porphyrion's soul And forward drew him; he remembered now His errand. In that instant the ripe war Broke like a tempest; the great squadrons loosed Shot forward glittering, like a splendid wave That rises out of shapeless gloom, a form Massy with dancing crest, threatening and huge, And effortlessly irresistible Bursts on the black rocks turbulently abroad, Falling, and roaring, and re-echoing far. So rushed that ordered fury of steeds and spears Under an arch of arrows hailing dark Against the stubborn foe: they from the slope Swept onward opposite with clang as fierce: Afar, pale women from the wall looked down. Porphyrion saw: he was a spirit changed. He hearkened not to memory, hope or fear, But cast them from him violently, and swift To fuse in this fierce impulse all regret, To woo annihilation, or to plunge At least in fiery action his unused Vain life, and in that burning furnace melt The idle vessel and re-mould it new, Spurred his horse on into the very midst, And loud the streaming battle swallowed him. Just on that instant when the meeting shock Tumultuously clashed, and cries were mixt With glitter of blades whirled like spirted spray, He came: and as the thundering ranks recoiled, They saw him, solitary, flushed and young, A radiant ghost in the dead hero's arms. Amazement smote them; in that pause he rode Forward; and shouting Orophernes' name Jubilant the swayed host came after him. Iron on iron gnashed: Porphyrion smote Unwearied; the bright peril stilled his brain, The terrible joy inspired him: by his side Vaunting, young men over their ready graves Were rushing glorious: many as they rushed Drank violent draughts of darkness unawares, And swiftly fell; but he uninjured fought. Easily as men conquer in a dream He passed through splintered spears, opposing shields And shouting faces, and wild cries, and blood; Till now a hedge of battle bristling sprang All round him, and no way appeared, and dark This way and that the rocking weight of war Swung heavy, shields and lances interclasped. He in his heart felt hungrier the flame Burning for desolation, and he flushed, Sanguine of death; the sudden starting blood Inflamed him, drunk as with a mighty wine. And on an instant terror from the air Upon the foemen fell; from heart to heart As in mysterious mirrors flashed; afar Triumphing cries rose all at once, and death Shone dazzling in their eyes, and they were lost. Then on them rushed the victors glorying. Shaken abroad the battle fiercely flowed, Wild-scattering sudden as quicksilver stream Spilled in a thousand drops; the electric air Pulsed with the vehemence of strong bodies hurled In mad pursuit, till yielding or in flight Or fallen, the defeated armies ran Broken, and on the wall the women wailed. Then to their camp the victors came, and all Followed Porphyrion wondering, and acclaimed His triumph: he in an exultant dream Still moved, and had no thought, but from the lips Of bearded captains, as around their fires That night they told of old heroic deeds, Heard his own praise, and feasted, and afar Drank, like an ocean wind, the air of fame. Book V Meanwhile in the surrendered city, night Went heavy, not in feasting nor in sleep. Proud in submission were those stubborn hearts, And nursed through darkness thoughts of far revenge, Mixt with the glory of their courage vain. And now as the first beam revisited Their sorrow, and to each his neighbour's face Disclosed, they stood at leisure to perceive How grimly famine on their limbs had wrought, And on their wasted cheeks and temples worn; And from their eyes shone desolated fire, Inflexible resolve unstrung in the end. They saw the sentinels with haughty pace Trample the thresholds of their homes, and watched In melancholy indolence all day Soldiers upon their errands come and go. At evening afar off a bugle blew, Sounding humiliation and despair To them, but triumph to their conquering foes, Who now in bright magnificence arrayed Their hosts to enter the dejected walls. Feigning indifference, each man to his door Came forth; beneath the battlemented arch Too soon detested ensign and proud plume They saw; the broad flag streaming to the air Fresh flowered purples, like a summer field, The trumpets blown, the thousand upright spears Shining, and drums and ordered trampling feet. But in the van of these battalions stern All wondered to behold a single youth, Riding unhelmeted with ardent mien, And all about him casting his bright eyes. Up through the thronged street triumphing he rode. But as he passed, his radiant look, that seemed From some far glory to have taken light, Shining among dark faces, suffered change. Nothing on either side but hate or woe, Defiant or averted, sullen youth And wasted age, all misery, smote his gaze. As the sun's splendour leaves a mountain peak Sinking into the west, and ashy pale Leaves it, the sadder from that former glow, So from Porphyrion's face the glory ebbed, His eye grew dim, and pain altered his brow. At last that conquering army, with the night, Possessed the city; and a hum arose Like busy noise of settling bees; and fires, Kindled, shed broad into the gloom a blaze; And there were sounds of feasting and loud mirth, And riot late, until by slow degrees Returned darkness and silence, and all slept. Only Porphyrion slept not: on his bed, Turning from lamentable thoughts in vain, He lay. But in that stillest hour, when first Stars fade, and mist arises, and air chills, Quite wearied out with toil and war within, Slumber at length fell on him; but not peace. Scarce had he wandered in the ways of sleep Some moments, when before his feet appeared, Solemn and in the bright attire of dreams, She whom his waking soul so many days, So many months, had followed still in vain, His dearest unattainable desire. But now she looked into his face, and saw His grief, and met him with reproachful eyes. “What dost thou here, Porphyrion?” Her grave voice Was musical with sorrow. “Faintest thou In seeking me, thy joy, tired of the way Because the hour is not yet come to find? Dost thou forget what in thy desert cell I warned thee to be perilous on thy path, Luring of loud distraction, and delay, The vastness of the world and thy frail heart? Seek on, faint not, prove all things till thou find; And still take comfort; where thou art, I am.” Her voice, that trembled in the dreamer's soul From some celestial distance, like a breeze, Ended: the brightness went, and he awoke. And lo, the placid colours of the dawn Were stealing in: he rose, and came without. Ah, now, sweet vision, O my perfect light, I come to thee, my love, my only truth! It was not I, but some false clouding self That fell bewildered in this erring way; Or an oblivion rose from underground To blind me; but this place of grief and blood I leave, to follow thee for evermore. Full of this fervent prayer, through the dim street He went: the stillness hearkened at his heels. Now as he passed, in chilly waftings fresh He scented the far morning: the blue night Thinned, and all pale things were disclosed; and now Even in his earnest pace he could not choose But pause a moment; for all round he saw Faces and forms lying in shadowy sleep Within dark porches, and by sheltering walls, And under giant temple-colonnades, Utterly wearied. Some in armour lay Dewy, with forehead upturned to the dawn; And some against a pillar leaned, with hands Open and head thrown back; an ancient pair With fingers clasping slumbered, by whose side A bearded warrior moved in his dark dream Exclaiming fiercely; and a mother pressed Her baby closer, even in her sleep. He gazed upon them by a charm detained. For heavy over all their slumber weighed; And if one lifted voice or arm, it was As plants that in deep water idly stir And then are still: so these, bodies entranced, Lay under soft oblivion deeply drowned. But, as they slept, the light stole over them By pale degrees, and each unconscious soul Yielded his secret: with the hues of dawn Into that calm of faces floated up Out of their living and profound abyss What thoughts, what dreams, what terrors, what dumb wails! What gleams of ever-burning funeral fires On haunted deserts where delight had been! Glories, and dying memories, and desires! What sighs, that like a piercing odour rose From the long pain of love, what beauty strange Of joy, and sweetness unreleased, and strength Fatally strong to bear immortal woe, And anguish darkly sepulchred in peace. Porphyrion gazed, and as he gazed, he wept. For he beheld how in those spirits frail, Slept also passions mightier than themselves, Waiting to rend and toss them; tiger thoughts, Ecstasies, hungers, and disastrous loves, Violent as storms that sleep under the wave, Vast longings cruelly in flesh confined, And wrecking winds of madness and of doom. He trembled; yet as knowledge, even of things Terrible, hath power to calm and to sustain, His soul endured that truth, and to its depth Feared not to plunge. Now he began to love, And to be sorrowful with a new sorrow. “What have I done,” he sighed, “what have I lost, My brothers, that I have no part in you? Yet am I of your flesh and you of mine. Sleep for this hour hath separated you From one another, but from me for ever. O that I could delay with you, and bear Your lot! or with enchanting wand have power To raise you out of slumber into peace! To be entwined and rooted in that life Which brings you want of one another, pain Borne not alone, and all that human joy, How sweet it were to me! O you of whom, When you awaken, others will have need, I envy you those trusting eyes, and hands Put forth for help: I envy all your grief. But I am all made of untimeless. Necessity drives on my soul to pass Another way; my errand is not here. Farewell, farewell, O happy, troubled hearts!” As a blind man who feels around him move The blest, who see, and fancies them embraced Or feasting in each other's joyous eyes; With such deep envy often he turned back, Even as he went, to those unconscious forms That slumbered. But his spirit urged him on, With kindled heart and quickened feet: and now He neared the shadow of the city gate, And saw the mountains rise beyond, far off. With longing he drew in the freshened air. But even at that moment he perceived, Standing before a doorway in the dawn, A solitary woman, motionless As cloud at evening piled in the pale east After retreating thunder: like the ash Of a spent flame her cheek, and in her eyes Deep-gazing, a great anguish lay becalmed. Coldly she looked on him, and calmly spoke In marble accent: “Enter and behold What thou hast done!” He would have passed due on, Following his way resolved, but like a charm Beautiful sorrow in this grave regard Drew him aside. He entered and beheld. Upon a bed, unstirring and supine, Lay an old man, so old that the live breath Seemed rather hovering over him, than warm Within his placid limbs; yet had he strapped Ancient armour upon him, and unused A heavy sword lay by him on the ground. Dim was the room: a table in the midst Stood empty; in the whole house all was bare. Now when Porphyrion entered, and with him The woman, the old man nothing perceived: But at the sound a boy, that by the wall Was leaning, opened wide his painful eyes. Porphyrion with accusing heart beheld. Then to the woman turning, of their story He questioned: quietly she answered him. “We were four souls under a happy roof Until your armies came. Then was our need More cruel every day. When first our meat Grew scarce, we sat with feigning eyes and each The other shunned. I know not who thou art, But if thou takest pity upon pain, I pray that no necessity bring thee Hunger more dear than love. With me it was So that I dared not look upon my child Lest I should grudge him eat. To my old father, Whom age makes helpless as a child, my breast As to a child I gave: and I have stood Under the trees and cursed them that so slow They budded for our want: the buds we tore Ere they could grow to leaf. So passed our days. But worse the nights were, when sleep would not come For hunger, and the dreadful morn seemed sweet. And if thou wonder that I weep not now Recounting them, it is that I have borne What carries beyond grief.” She in her tale Spoke nothing of her husband: he lay cold Without the city fallen; but as now She ended, the returning thought of him Absented her sad eyes. And suddenly Her heart, of a strange tenderness aware, Out of its heavy frost was melted: then She bowed her head, and she let forth her tears. You that have known that bitter wound, of all The bitterest, since no courage brings it balm, When silent all the misery of the world Knocks at your door and you have empty hands, You know what dart entered Porphyrion's breast, As he beheld and heard. But now the boy Turning with restless body and parched lip Sighed, “Give me water! I am so thirsty, mother, I cannot fetch the breath into my throat.” Porphyrion filled a cup and gave to him. Deeply he drank, closing his eyes, as bliss Were in the cold fresh drops: unwillingly His fingers from the cup relaxed; and now The mother spoke. “Yesterday on the walls One of your arrows smote him, and the wound Torments him. If thou wilt, make water warm, I pray thee, and bind up his cruel hurt Afresh; for my hand trembles, I am weak.” So he made water warm, and washed the wound With careful tender hands, and ointment soft Laid on, and in sweet linen bound it up. Comforted then the boy put round his neck One arm, and sighing thanks, as a child will, With faltering hand caressed him. That fond touch Porphyrion endured not. Are men born So apt to misery, thought he, that even this Is worthy thanks? Yet his wrought heart attained Even in such slender spending of its love A little ease. Now, said he, I must go, I must not longer tarry: for she calls, Whom I am vowed to follow and to find. But when he looked upon those three, they seemed To need him in their helplessness; the child Divining, mutely prayed him: he resolved For that day to remain and then to go. So all that day he tended them and went Abroad into the town, and brought them food, Bartering his share of spoil for meat and bread, And freshest fruit, and delicatest wine; Nor marked he as he went the frowning eyes Of the stern soldiers, how they stood and watched Murmuring together, sullen and askance. As in a slumbering great city, snow With gentle foot comes muffling empty ways, Corners and alleys, and to the tardy dawn Faint the murmur of toil ascends, and dumb The wheels roll, and the many feet go hushed, So on his mind lay sorrow: hum of arms And voices, all were soft to him and strange. Day passed, and evening fell, and in that house All slept; and once again he would renew His journey; but once more his heart perplexed Smote him, to leave them so: They have no friend, He said, and who will tend them, if not I? The next day he abode, and with fond care Ministered to their need, and still the next Found him delaying and his own dim pain Solacing sweetly; for the old man now By faint degrees returned to healthful warmth, And grave with open eyes serenely looked In a mild wonder on this unknown friend: The mother, taxed no longer to endure Even to her utmost strength, permitted calm To her worn spirit, and her wasted limbs Resigned into a happy weariness; And the child's hurt began to be appeased. On the fourth morn Porphyrion arose, And saw them all still laid in peaceful sleep. Now, said he, will I go upon my quest, Less troubled: they have need of me no more. He turned to go, but in the early light Still looked upon them, and his heart was full; And softly he unbarred the door, and seemed Within his soul to see the whole great world Await his coming, and its wounded breast Disclose, and all life radiantly unroll Her riches, opening to an endless end. Filled with the power of that impassioned thought, Into the silence of the morning sun He came; and on a sudden was aware Of men about the entrance thronged; they set Their bright spears forward, and his path opposed. Astonished, he looked on them, and perceived The faces of those warriors he had brought Thither exulting, and in victory led; Yet on their faces he beheld his doom. He stood in that great moment greatly calm, Proudly confronting them, and cried aloud: “What murmur you against me? I for you Fought, and you triumphed. Have I asked of one A single boon? Soldiers, will you take arms Against your captain? Men, will you dare to strike A man unarmed? You answer not a word! Put up your swords; for now I will pass on To my own work, and as I came will go.” There was a stillness as he ceased, and none Answered, but none gave way. As when in heaven Clouds curdle, and the heavy thunder holds All things in stupor hushed, they stood constrained, Menacing and mistrustful; and their hearts Grew cruel: the uncomprehended light, That in Porphyrion shone and flushed his brow With radiance, like the bright ambassador Come from an unknown power, tormented them; And dark enchanting terror drove them on. Then one by stealth an arrow to his bow Fitted, and strung, and drew it, and the shaft Beside Porphyrion in the lintel stuck Quivering: and at once they fiercely cried. Like the loud drop that loosens the pent storm, That loosened arrow drew tempestuous hail From every bow: they lusted after blood, And put far from them pity: and he fell Before them. Yet astonished and dismayed, Those sacrificers saw the victim smile Triumphing and incredulous of death, Even in anguish: pang upon fresh pang Rekindled the lost light, the perished bloom Of memory, and he was lifted far In exaltation above death; he drank Wine at the banquet, and the stormy thrill Of battle caught him, and he knew again The dart of love and the sweet wound of grief In one transfigured instant, that illumed And pierced him, as the arrows pierced his side. Then, mingling all those bright beams into one Full glory, dawned upon his dying sense She whom his feet followed through all the world Out of the waste, and over perilous paths, Dearer than breath and lovelier than desire. Like the first kiss of love recovered new Was the undreamed-of joy, that he in death With the last ecstasy of living found, Tasted and touched, as she embraced his soul. Then the world perished: stretching forth his arms, Into the unknown vastness eagerly He went, and like a bridegroom to his bride. THE DEATH OF ADAM Cedars, that high upon the untrodden slopes Of Lebanon stretch out their stubborn arms, Through all the tempests of seven hundred years Fast in their ancient place, where they look down Over the Syrian plains and faint blue sea, When snow for three days and three nights hath fall'n Continually, and heaped those terraced boughs To massy whiteness, still in fortitude Maintain their aged strength, although they groan; In such a wintriness of majesty, O'ersnowed by his uncounted years, and scarce Supporting that hard load, yet not o'ercome, Was Adam: all his knotted thews were shrunk, Hollow his mighty thighs, toward which his beard, Pale as the stream of far-seen waterfalls, Hung motionless; betwixt the shoulders grand Bowed was the head, and dim the gaze; and both His heavy hands lay on his marble knees. So sits he all day long and scarcely stirs, And scarcely notes the bright shapes of his sons Moving in the broad light without his tent, That propt on poles about a giant oak Looks southward to the river and the vale: Only sometimes slowly he turns his head, As seeking to recover some lost thought From the dear presence of the white-haired Eve Who, less in strength, hath less endured, and still With slow and careful footsteps tendeth him, Or seated opposite with silent eyes Companions him; their thoughts go hand in hand. So now she sits reposing in the dusk Of their wide tent, like a great vision throned Of the Earth Mother, tranquil and august, Accorded to some youthful votary Deep in an Asian grove, under the moon. Peace also rests on Adam; not such peace As comes forlornly to men dulled with cares, Whom no ennobling memory uplifts; Peace of a power far mightier than his own, Outlasting all it fostered into life, Pervades him and sustains him: such a peace As blesses mossed and mouldering architraves Of pillars standing few among the wreck Of many long since fallen, pillars old, Reared by a race long vanished, where the birds Nest as in trees, and every crevice flowers, As mothering Earth, having some time indulged Men's little uses, makes their ruin fair Ere in her bosom it be folded up. Thus Adam's mind relinquishing the world, That grows more dim around him every day, Withdraws into itself, and in degree As all that mates him to the moving hours, Even as his outward joy and vigour fail, So surely turns his homing spirit back Unto those silent sources whence delight And hope and strength and buoyancy of old Flowed fresh upon his youth, persisting still To seek those first and fairest memories In youth and sunshine O how lightly lost, How difficult in darkness to regain! He sits in idle stillness, yet at times From the dark wells of musing some old hour Floats upward, as the tender lotus lifts Her swaying stalk up through the limpid depth Of pools in rivers never known to man, And buoyed on idle wet luxurious leaves Peacefully opens white bloom after bloom. He is rapt far from this last shore of age; He sees the face of Eve as she approached To bring him flowers new-found in Paradise, Or hiding her young sorrow on his breast; And Abel as a child and Cain with him Playing beneath the shadow of old trees, All dearer by the desert interposed Of time and toil and passionate regret, Troubling his inmost spirit, until his face, Wrought with remembrance and with longing, wears The pressure and the sign of all that swells And brims his heart, fain to be freed in speech. “What ails thee, Adam?” gentle Eve began. “Why art thou troubled, what thoughts vex thy mind? For though my eyes are dim, yet I can see Thy breast heaves upward, and long sighs go forth, And thou dost move thy hands, and shake thy head.” But Adam answered not; he seemed alone. Then, lifting up his eyes, he saw his sons Slowly approaching in the evening light With all their flocks; and many voices rose On the clear air about the tents and trees, As they made ready for the sacrifice Before the evening meal: soon they drew near To Adam's tent; and he looked on them all, Standing to wait his blessing, of all years, From the boy Adriel to the aged Seth, Outlined with glory by the sinking sun. Strange in their strength and beauty they appeared; And Adam, though he saw them, seemed to gaze Beyond them, seeking what he found not there. Over them all his eyes unresting roved, While they in silence waited for his word. At last he spoke: “Where is my first-born Cain?” They looked on one another. Few had heard That darkened name; but Eve bowed down her head. And Seth stood forth amid them hushed and spoke With a grave utterance, “Cain is far away. Thou knowest, O my father, how we have heard That far beyond the mountains to the east He dwells, and ever wanders o'er that land. Many days' journey must a man be gone Ere he reach thither and return again; Nor know we certainly where Cain may dwell. Yet what thou biddest, that shall be performed; Shall we send to him?” Adam answered, “Send: Let them go quickly, see that they make haste. But on the tenth day bid them come again, Whether they have found him, or have found him not, For mine eyes fail, yea, and my heart grows cold.” Heavy as pale clouds of October roll Over the soaring snows of Ararat, The vapour of oblivion fell once more Down over Adam's head, in languor drooped Between his mighty shoulders on his breast. From morn to night, from night to morn he sat As in a trance of deep thought undivined. His children looking on his face were filled With desolation and disquietude, Sad as Armenian shepherds when they watch For the still clouds to roll from those great peaks, Praying the clear bright North winds to restore Their guardian mountain; with such heavy hearts They waited for his face to give a sign That still gave none. Listless amid their toil They grew, and sitting idle by their flocks Each from his station, scattered on the hills, Turned often to the east, in hope to spy The messengers returning: but at eve While the gray-bearded elders patient sat In the cool tent-doors, they would pace the shore Under the gathering stars, and murmured low One to another saying, “What is this That comes upon us all, what evil thing Whereof we have not heard? What cloud is fallen Upon our father Adam, and why seeks he This Cain whose name we know not? Peace is gone, And nothing now is as it was before.” And others answered, “Well for us, if they Whom we have sent on such a hazard come Ever again or we behold them more! Would they had never gone on this dark quest! We have no hunters brave and swift as they,— Ophir, that was the strongest of us all, And Iddo, that could match the eagle's sight.” Thus the young men spoke their despondent mind. But every morn renewing wearied hope They turned with the sunrising to the east, And numbered the long hours till noon, and still Nor morn nor noon brought tidings; and each eve Watching tall herons by the sandy pools Widen their wings and slow with trailing feet And lifted head sail off into the sky, They followed them with long and silent thoughts Over the darkening mountains, far and far Into that never yet imagined world Beginning to oppress them; whither now Their fears went wandering through enormous night. Thus waxed and waned each heavy day; at last From mouth to mouth the unquiet murmur ran, “'Tis the ninth evening, and they are not come!” The kingly star had stolen from his throne In the first brightening of the morrow morn; And far in the east, with frail cloud overspread, Light hovered in the pale immensity. A mile-broad shade beneath the mountain slept; But opposite a dewy glimmer soon Moulded the shapes of rough crags, and beneath Strewn boulders, and thin streams, and slopes obscure. There, on the slopes amid the rocks appeared The youth of Adam's race, assembled forms Sitting or standing with hand-shaded eyes At gaze into the eastern gorge, where hills Between dark shoulders inaccessible Opened a narrowing way into the dawn. Stiller than statues, yet with beating hearts They waited while the wished light kindled clear, Invading that deep valley, until the sun Flamed warm upon their limbs through coloured air, And slow rose upward: it was nigh to noon: At last a motion on the horizon stirred And a faint dust in the far gorge was blown. Then those that sat rose up and gazed erect, And those that stood moved and stept on a pace. And as they watched amid the shining dust Two far-off forms appeared, but only two. Their straining eyes watched, but no other came. A sigh ran through their troubled ranks, they turned To one another, then again to those Two lonely journeyers downcast and slow, Who now discerned them from afar and raised Their hands in greeting; then some ran, with cakes Of bread, and skins of milk, and honeycombs, Down the great slope to meet the messengers; And others climbed the ridge and backward ran Down to the tents, the river, and the vale, And came to where Seth sat beneath a tree Waiting, with folded arms, and cried to him, “They come, they come; but Cain comes not with them.” Then Seth arose and came to Adam's tent, And stood before his father in the door. Eve questioning sought his eyes: he shook his head And looked on Adam; motionless he sat Plunged in a trance, yet dimly was aware Of tidings, as he heard the voice of Seth, “'Tis the tenth morning, and thy sons return.” Faintly by imperceptible degrees Light stole o'er Adam's features, and Seth saw The wellings of his troubled mind on them, As one who in a cavern lifts a torch And sees the gradual recesses grow Out of their ancient gloom, uncertain shapes Of rugged roof and walls without an end: So dark from innermost obscurity The slumbrous memories of Adam rose And on his face appeared: yet still a veil Remained betwixt his senses and the world; When now the noise of many feet drew nigh Softly approaching: and Seth spoke again, “Behold! thy sons, thy messengers are here.” He drew the matted curtains of the tent Aside, and Adam raised his head and saw All his assembled children coming on, Hushing their steps in awe; they stopped at gaze Now as his eyes were on them; but before Came the two messengers and stood alone, How soiled and burnt with travel! Round the neck Of Ophir hung the leopard's spotty hide Stripped from that fierce beast strangled by his hand, Torn now and stained; neither had paused to wash The thick dust from his feet; but Iddo held A spray of leaves new-plucked to freshen him Seared on the parching mountain; thus they stood With troubled countenance and hanging head Till Ophir spoke; all listened rapt and still. “Father, we went; and lo, we are come back On the tenth morn, according to thy word. For we have sought Cain but have found him not. We passed beyond the mountains and we crossed The sultry desert, toiling in hot sands Two heavy days, and thence with difficulty Climbed the far ridge unto the land beyond. It is a land not fruitful like our vale, Barren it is with short grass and few trees; On the fifth day we came into the midst Of that bare country and we saw no man, Nor knew we whither to direct our steps, When on a slope at unawares we spied A sheepfold made of stones, and Lo! we said To one another, Surely he was here. Then eagerly we climbed the highest hill And all around gazed long, but saw no more. But toward the evening, when the light was low And the extremest mountains grew distinct, Far off in the clear air, but very far, We saw a little smoke go up to heaven, And we cried out, It is the home of Cain! But deeply we were troubled and perplext, For we were faint and footsore, and thy word Lay heavy on our thoughts, remembering it, On the tenth morning see that ye be here! Surely our hearts were eager to go on; But thinking of thy word we feared to go, And hardly even now are we returned. Father, we did thy bidding. Is it well?” All gathered nearer, hushed and wistful; all Awaited Adam's voice, but he was mute. They would have prayed him, but they ventured not; Like hunters that at hot noon, lost in woods, Pressing through boughs and briers, at unawares Come on the huge throat of a hollow cliff Ribbed with impending ledges of wet moss, Whence in a smooth-lipped basin of black stone Some secret water wells without a sound: Then sorely though they thirst they fear to drink, Awed by the mystery of that silent source, So these awhile with beating hearts delayed To speak, awaiting what his words might be. At last he raised his head and turned his eyes On Eve, and looked upon her long, while she On him hung gazing: light began to burn In his dimmed eyes, and his whole frame was wrought With the stirring of his spirit, as of old. At length the thoughts were kindled on his tongue: He lifted up his voice and cried aloud. “O that mine eyes had seen thee once again, Cain, that my hands had blessed thee! Thou art gone, For ever gone, and still that curse abides On thee who wast my joy, my first-born child. Eve, Eve, hast thou forgotten that far hour, When our first child, our baby newly-born, Held up his little and defenceless hands Crying toward thy bosom?” And Eve sighed: “Surely my bosom hath not forgotten Cain, Who sucked the tender first milk from its paps. His feet are worn, wandering the desert wide, But I have washed them with my tears in dreams. Oh, in my heart he has not left his home. Would I might lay my arms about him now! Yet why, O Adam, utterest thou these thoughts? Thou knowest how betwixt us and our son There lies a land we may not overleap More than the flames of those exiling swords, Because of our fault, Adam, and of his. Why dost thou waken this our ancient pain?” But Adam still uplifted his lament: “He is gone from us, gone beyond our reach, Beyond our yearning, he remembers not These arms that were around his weakness once, These hands that fed him and that fostered him And now would bless him. All these have I blessed With many blessings, but him whom I cursed Him would I bless at last, and be at peace. He is gone from me, and now these also go Whither I know not, and I fear for them. How often have I seen them going forth Into the woods upon these hills, how oft See them with night returning, but now they Depart for ever and return no more.” Eve wondering replied with earnest voice, “Behold them, Adam, they are very fair And strong with all the strength that we have lost. What ill shall harm them more than hath harmed us? Remember how when I was used to fear, Beholding our first child in his soft youth Go from us on his tender feet alone— His tender feet a little stone might bruise, And would have caught him back to my fond breast, Thou didst rebuke me, saying it must be That he go forth alone; now thou dost fear, When these are strong and we can help no more.” But Adam shook his head and answered not. For he was like a shepherd who hath lit A fire to warm him on the mountain side In the first chill after the summer heats, And drowsing by the embers wakes anon With wonder-frighted eyes, to see the sparks Blowing astray run kindling over grass And withered heath and bushes of dry furze, And ere his heavy senses, pricked with smoke, Uncloud, the white fire rushes from his reach, Leaps to embrace the tall pines, tossing up A surge of trembling stars, and eagerly Roars through their topmost branches, wide aflame, While all around enormous shadows rock And wrestle, as tumultuous lights o'errides The darkness as with charging spears and plumes, Till the whole hillside reddens, and beyond Far mountains waken flushed out of the night: Then he who ignorantly had started up This wild exulting glory from its sleep Forgets to stir his steps or wring his hands; The swiftness and the radiance and the sound Beget a kind of rapture in his dread; Like that amazed shepherd Adam saw His race, sprung out of darkness, fill the earth Increasing swift and terrible like fire That feeds on all its ruins, wave on wave Streaming impetuous without rest or pause Right onward to the boundaries of the world: And he how helpless who had caused it all! So stood his soul still in a gaze of awe Filled with the foretaste of calamity: And his lips broke into a groaning cry. “What is this thing that I have done, what doom, What boundless and irrevocable doom, My children, have I wakened for you all? O could I see the end, but end is none. My thoughts are carried from me, and they faint, As birds that come from out the farthest sky, Voyaging to a home far, far beyond, Sink in our valley on a drooping wing Quite wearied out, yea, we have seen them sink, So my thoughts faint within my bosom old; The vision is too vast, I am afraid.” But understanding nothing of his speech, That yet seemed opening some mysterious door Disclosing an horizon all unknown, His children listened, touched to trouble vague And longing without name: like travellers Who in a company together pass On some spring evening by an upland road, And as they travel, each in thought immersed, Rich merchants, wise in profitable cares, Adventurous youths, and timorous old men, Through deepening twilight the young rising moon Begins to cast along them a mild gleam, And shadows trembling from the wayside trees In early leaf steal forward on the ground Beside them, and faint balm is past them blown; All troubles them with beauty fresh and strange, Stealing their thoughts away; so tenderly Were Adam's children troubled when they heard. Long silence fell. At last with heavy voice And weakened utterance Adam spoke again: “My children, bring me fruits and bring me flowers, Set them within my sight that I may see And touch them, and their sweetness smell once more.” They hasted and plucked flowers and gathered fruit Such as their valley yielded; balsam boughs, Late roses, darkly flushed, or honey-pale, And heavy clustered grapes, and yellowing gourds, Plump figs, and dew-moist apples, and smooth pears. All these they brought and heaped before his sight. Voyagers in the utmost seas, when ice Pinions their vessel fast and they prepare For the blind frozen winter's boundless night, How jealously they watch the last low rays, How from the loftiest vantage in their view Cherish the rosy warmth still on their limbs, Tarrying until the bright rim wholly dips! Adam, by huger darkness overhung, So longed to taste life warm even to the last; And fostering those fair flowers upon his lap And holding a gold apple in his hand Remembered Eden. O what blissful light Flowed o'er his heart and bathed it in its beams! It seemed the deep recesses of his soul Welled up their inmost wisdom at the last: He glowed with some transfiguring fire; his lips Moved, and his face uplifted was inscribed With mighty thoughts, that thus at length unrolled Their solemnly assembled syllables. “Look well on me, my children, whom ye lose! Behold these eyes that have wept tears for you, Behold these arms that have long toiled for you!— These hands in Paradise have gathered flowers; These limbs, which ye have seen so wasted down In feebleness, so utterly brought low, They grew not into stature like your limbs. I wailed not into this great world a child Helpless and speechless, understanding naught, But from God's rapture perfect and full-grown I suddenly awoke out of the dark. How sweet a languor did enrich the blood In my warmed veins, as on my opening eyes The splendour of the world shone slowly in, Mingling its radiant colours in my soul! Yea, in my soul and only in my soul I deemed them to abide: sky, water, trees, The moving shadows and the tender light, This solid earth, this wide and teeming earth, Which we have trodden, weary step by step, Nor found beginning of an end of it, I deemed it all abounding in my brain: The murmur of the waters and the winds Seemed but a music sighing from my joy; Then I arose, and ventured forth afoot; And soon, how soon, was dispossessed of all! By every step I travelled into truth That stripped me of my proud dreams, one by one, Till all were taken. On such faltering feet By gradual but most certain steps I came Into my real and perfect solitude, Alone amid the world that knew not me. O Eve, thou knowest what I tell not now, How I was comforted, and all the woe That fell on our transgression; yet not less When that first child lay babbling on thy knees, Then again said I, ‘Surely this is mine.’ And you, my children, whom I saw increase Around me, stronger as my strength decayed, How often have I called you also mine! But now my first-born is not any more, Or wanders lost from me, and ye, ye too Go from me over earth, forgetting me. So surely I perceive, for all that I In joy begot you, ye are mine no more. But ye, who seem the proud and easy lords Of this fair earth, ye too must tread the path Which I trod in my ignorant longing, lose What I have lost, and find what I have found. What seek you, O my children, what seek you? For I behold you in this narrow vale, That mountains and deep forests compass round Filled with desires. Beyond is all the world That hardly shall content them; ye must go Forth into that vast world, as from my feet This water glides, we know not whither; yea, Even as this stream is prisoned in its speed, So shall ye be imprisoned in desire. But when you have imagined peace and balm For your endeavour, musing, ‘This is mine,’ When you shall say, ‘I have a cause for joy,’ Then be distrustful, lest you only learn How cruel is desire till it attain, And being baffled yet more cruel grows, Indignant not to find what it had sought, And suffering ye rage, and raging fall Upon your own flesh. Ah, deal tenderly With one another, O my sons, for ye, Caged in these limbs that toil under the noon, Are capable of sorrow huge as night; And still must ye bear all, whatever come. Look how the trees in an untimely spring Put forth their sweet shoots on the frosty air That withers up the tender sap, yet still Cannot delay their ripening, nor fold back Their wounded buds into the sheltering rind; So shall ye shrink, yet so must ye endure. I that was strong and proud in strength, and now Am come to this last weakness, tell you this: Alas, could ye but know it as I know. I speak in vain, ye cannot understand.” He ended sighing: for his mind was filled With apprehensions rolling up from far The doom and tribulation of his race. Looking upon the faces of his sons, Well he divined their weakness from his own. He knew what they should suffer; yet the worst He knew not; had he known, he would have rued Less to be parent of their feebleness Than of their strength, the power to maim and rend And ravage even that which to their hearts Is dearest, though they know not what they do, Trampling their peace in dust; had he seen all The dreadful actors on the endless stage, Sprung from his loins,—the triumphing blind hordes, Spurred by an ignorant fury to create An engine of fierce pleasure in the pangs Wrung from the brave, the gentle, and the wise, And raging at a beauty not their own That vexes all their vileness; till the world, Discovering too late its precious loss, Loves and laments in vain: had he seen this, His grief had gone forth in a bitterer cry. But they that heard him heard incredulous. Trouble was far, and sweet youth in their hearts. The beauty of the world encompassed them; All else was fable; and they stood elate Yet stirred and pensive, in such wondering pause As might a troop of children who have found In a king's garden, under shadowy yews, Ancestral marbles on a sculptured wall, Half hid in vines, and lifting up the leaves Gaze in a bright-eyed wonder on fair shapes Of arming heroes and unhappy queens, Or press soft lips on Helen's woeful mouth, Touching her perfect breast, and smile on her, Unknowing how beneath that heavenly mould Swelled, like a sea, the powers of love and pain, Powers that shall surely also rock themselves In storms, and their young courage crush to sobs, Toss them on easeless beds, blind their hot eyes With tears, in longing violent as vain, Till they shall quite forget how life was once Sweet as a rose's breath and only fair, As now 'tis fair and sweet to Adam's sons. Exalted in expectancy, they mused, And in their veins a warmer current glowed Round their full-moulded limbs; their open eyes Shone wistful, and they murmured to themselves, When Adam's voice recalled them to his grief. Out of unfathomable deeps his words Seemed drawn in solemn slowness. “Lo, the light Makes ready to go from you, even as I. Hearken, my sons! Upon the mountain side There is a cave that looks toward the East: And thence in the evening clearness have I oft Far-off beheld the gates of Paradise. Mine eyes would feel that glory once again Ere they be turned for ever to the night. Therefore go down and strew a bed for me, Lay me upon that bed and bear me up. It grows late and I may not tarry more.” But now at last the certainty of woe Smote through them, and they feared exceedingly, Scarce knowing yet what this command might mean. They would have stayed, but Adam with raised hands Moved them unto his bidding; they went down And busied them, most sadly, o'er that toil By the stream's shore, plaiting a bed of withes, And some prepared rough poles, some gathered leaves. Adam with Eve remained alone; the light Slept warm upon the grass and on their feet, And round about them in the spacious tent Struck upward hovering glories, pale and clear. He turned to her those eyes which never yet Sought there a solace or heart's ease in vain, And spoke, “O Eve!” but even there his voice Stopt in the shadow of his coming thoughts, And he could say no more; but she came near To lay her hands on his cold hands, and looked On his bowed face, and with a soft reproach Answered him, “Adam, thou didst say but now That all were going from thee o'er the earth And thou shouldst be alone, and none be thine, And no companion with thee any more. Am I not with thee? Shall I go from thee? Am I not thine? Am I not wholly thine?” Then Adam lifted up his fallen brow And gently laid his great arms round her neck; He looked into her eyes, into her soul. The face of Eve was falling toward his breast; Her hair with his was mingled; now no more They spoke, for they had come beyond all words. They spoke not, stirred not, but together leaned, Grand in the marble gesture of a grief Becalmed for ever in the certitude Of this last hour that over them stood still. Thus had they stayed, nor moved, nor heeded aught; But 'twixt them and the light a shadow fell: And Adam lifted up his eyes, and saw Seth standing there; he knew the hour was come. For lo, about the doorway were the sons Of Adam all assembled, with their wives And children weeping; they had brought a bed Of plaited osiers heaped with leaves; and now Laying him on that litter, silently They lifted up the poles. Eve weeping sank Upon her knees: she kissed the dear last kiss; She held his body in her tender arms One aching moment, then relinquished him. Thus they began, the young men and the old, To bear him forth, unwillingly, with slow Sad footsteps planted on the yielding sand, While all the women wailed and wept aloud, Beating their breasts; they felt and were afraid Yet understood not; their despair was blind. But Eve, who understood her perfect loss Even to the utmost pang, wept now no more. Her daughters sobbing round her, hid their heads: She only, with dim eyes, stretched forth her hands. But they that bore the litter passed beside The bright stream's pebbly margin; and with them The bearded men and boys, all overcome With desolating thoughts and silent fears, Followed: soon slowly they began to climb Slopes scattered darkly o'er their bossy knolls With shadowy cedars, where the jutting ribs Of gray rock interposed; until at last They came to the great cavern in the cliff, And rested, gazing backward o'er the vale Reposing in the golden solitude. Then Adam said, “Lift me, that I may see.” With careful arms they lifted him: he gazed Down on the valley stretched out at his feet, Marked with the shining stream; he saw beyond Ranges of endless hills, and very far On the remote horizon high and clear Shone marvellous the gates of Paradise. There was his home, his lost home, there the paths His feet had trod in bliss and tears, the streams, The heavenly trees that had o'ershadowed him, Removed all into radiance, clear and strange As to a fisher on dark Caspian waves, Far from the land, appears the glimmering snow Of Caucasus, already bathed in dawn, Like a suspended opal huge in heaven, And wonder awes him to remember how Long happy mornings of his youth he strayed Over those same far valleys of his home, Now melted and subdued to phantom shade Beneath that lonely mount hung in the dawn: So over darkened intervening vales Tinged in the sweet fire of the light's farewell, Shone Eden upon Adam. Then he sighed A sigh not all of grief, “It is enough. Leave me, my children, to my peace; go ye And comfort Eve, go, prosper and be blest.” They each turned fearfully to each, but Seth Bowed down his head and hushed them with his hand. Silent with running tears they wept farewell, And, often looking backward, on slow feet Moved down the wide slope. Adam was alone. At last his eyes were closing, yet he saw Dimly the shapes of his departing sons, Inheriting their endless fate; for them The world lay free, and all things possible. Perchance his dying gaze, so satisfied, Was lightened, and he saw how vast a scope Ennobled them of power to dare beyond Their mortal frailty in immortal deeds, Exceeding their brief days in excellence, Not with the easy victory of gods Triumphant, but in suffering more divine; Since that which drives them to unnumbered woes, Their burning deep unquenchable desire, Shall be their glory, and shall forge at last From fiery pangs their everlasting peace. BAHRAM THE HUNTER When Bahram rode to the chase, Then saw ye his soul's delight Full on his kingly face. Who could his steed outpace? He swooped like a falcon's flight; Like a sunbeam that strikes from a cloud, Exulting and eager-browed, So rode he his reckless race. Bright flashed the pools at morn, And the sun o'er the mountains burned And gilded the antelope's horn In the plain, and the wild ass in scorn Of the hunter the hard soil spurned, Snuffing the wind, most fleet Of quarries, the beat of whose feet Is music to kings' ears borne. Bahram smiled as he rode On the gold-bright sands; debonair Was his look, and his glad voice flowed. White was the horse he bestrode, And over his black beard and hair The white-furred cap on his head Was hung with tassels of red: On his mantle a gold sun glowed. And round him glittering gay Rode princes and lords; he turned To each with a word to say In his royal courtesy; nay, Not a heart but joyously burned To be near to a heart so great, And was fain to be proved its mate In a glorious deed this day. But the king's men shouted; for lo! The wild ass afar they espied In the shallowing valley below, Where bright springs fathomless flow. He was shaking his neck in pride, And his heels the dust upthrew: Then Bahram shot forth to pursue, As a bolt that is shot from a bow. The princes of Persia spurred, But he left them all; this day There was neither second nor third To the king. Now a startled bird From the low thicket fluttered away; Then the plain smoked up in a cloud Behind them, and thundered aloud; Yet never the king they neared. Swifter the wild ass fled, But swifter the king came nigher, Wherever those fleet heels led; Now soft upon mosses he sped, Now the hoofs upon stone struck fire; Till the wild ass turned in his fear For an instant, and showed him clear The eyeball strained in his head. Then the princes shouted as one, For they heard the king's glad shout, And saw his spear raised in the sun, And the light o'er the long shaft run; As they looked for the steel to flash out On a sudden the place was bare; Bahram was no more there, And the wild ass galloped alone. Pale they spurred o'er the ground, Then reined in close with a cry, Gazing in terror around: Neither king nor horse they found. But before them laughed to the sky A pool of springs that well From the streams under earth and swell Through her secret caverns profound. The women of Ctesiphon wail, And the young men cry in the street, “No more now in the Vale Of Heroes shall Bahram hail His quarry of glancing feet, No more shall his voice delight Our hearts through the battle, and smite The ranks of the Tartar pale!” The mother of Bahram hath made Amid pillars his empty tomb Of porphyry, jasper and jade. Clear gums in fire she hath frayed To cloud it in idle fume. Not riches from isles of the dawn Nor spices from far Damaun Lure hither the strong-winged shade. Tomb nor prison shall tame Bahram the hunter's soul. As of old to the chase he came, He is turned not aside from his aim, He is mixed with the streams that roll Unending as man's desire, That shall not abate of its fire Till the whole world crumble in flame. THE DESERTED PALACE “My feet are dead, the cold rain beats my face!” “Courage, sweet love, this tempest is our friend!” “Yet oh, shall we not rest a little space? This city sleeps; some corner may defend Our weary bodies till the storm amend.” “So tired, dear heart? Then we will seek some place Safe from rude weather and this night air chill, And prying eyes of those that mean us ill.” These lovers, fleeing through the midnight street, Breathlessly pause amid the gusty moan Of winds that have not heard their echoing feet. Blind houses, towering up, leave light alone From narrow skies in glimmering swiftness blown: In front, from vales of darkness wild airs beat; Behind them, shouldering crests of cloudy pine Looms, lost in heaven, the cloven Apennine. Down the strange street their doubtful steps explore Each shadowy archway, angle, and recess, For shelter, nor have travelled far before Giselda, half-despaired for weariness, Feels on her fingers Raymond lightly press; Heavy above the surging wind's uproar With a dull echo, clanging now, then drowned, Reverberates a sullen stormy sound. What heart so fixed that darkness cannot shock? When the mind stumbles with the blind footfall, What world may not a random sound unlock, Wild as a fever-dream's original, Where through black void we should for ever fall, Did not our hearts freeze as in dungeon rock? So Night may mask, when reason, numbed in trance, Quails at the wandering cyclops, idiot Chance. Beyond a buttress both had crept more near. In this dim wall was it a gate that swung? Still hesitating, half-bewitched in fear, Upon the silent intervals they hung. Again it clanged as if the senseless tongue Of Chaos knelled upon the startled ear, Resounding mockery of that tranquil, bright Well-featured earth men fable in daylight. A gate so old it leaned and swung awry, With such indifferent motion to and fro As a stone rolled by shore waves fitfully, Heavy and melancholy, wavering slow, Then closed and clashing with a sudden blow: To what forlorn abode, left long to lie For spider, gray owl, and the blind bat's wing, Could this be door? What ruin mouldering? Raymond with doubtful hand felt on the bar Rusty and wet; pushed slow the ponderous wood That gaped on blackness; moaning from afar A riotous gust rolled back the hinge; he stood, And leaning pressed the dark weight all he could; Again it yielded with a grinding jar; They entered, where they knew not; empty ground Seemed closed by heights of doubled gloom around. “What place is this? My feet tread soft on grass,” Giselda whispered. Raymond drew her on. Across what seemed a weed-grown court they pass— Black walls around them, heaven above them wan— Till soon a row of pillars dimly shone Before them, o'er wet marble steps. “Alas! I fear,” she cried; but he drew close to his Her cheek, and made her blood brave with a kiss. Wondering in that deserted colonnade, They hearkened to the storm, less boisterous there, Till to their peering sight a hollower shade Signalled a doorway deep in quiet air; And now their hearts beat at an omen fair; For venturing hands, on either doorpost laid, Found, sculptured there, soft features of a child, Where, ignorant of darkness, beauty smiled. As sailors, nearing home, but blown from land, When the wind bears them scent of fields they knew; As a blind father, when his son's young hand, Laid confident on his, brings faith anew In the lost light and the pure heavenly blue; As homeless Psyche, when she trembling scanned Love's fair strange house, and a mild voice drew near Invisibly, and soothed away her fear; So thrilled by silent sweet encouragement, As if some guardian presence ministered To aid them, onward, hand in hand, they went. No living sound in all the place they heard; Still on they groped, but not a form appeared; Sometimes beneath an arch their heads were bent: At last a window, pallid through the gloom, Showed them each other 'mid an empty room. Each in the other's face, with breathing stilled, The tender bright eyes tenderly discerned; And they embraced, while both their bosoms filled With growing charm of peace so strangely earned. Rapt thus they stood, nor any longer turned At sudden gusts that through the midnight thrilled. He smoothed the rain-drops from her hair that strayed; She smiled and spoke: “I am no more afraid.” But soon a nest secure from wind they found, Pillowing their cloaks against the corner wall, And rested happy; there the roar was drowned, And only in subsiding interval Of shuddering flaws, they heard the rushing fall From rain-swept eaves; 'mid desolation round Their hearts beat closer to each other, warm Because of those wild blasts of wandering storm. Giselda drooped her heavy-lidded eyes; Tired out, her peaceful bosom sank and swelled: Soft upon Raymond's shoulder breathed her sighs; His fostering arm her leaning breast upheld; Her drowsing head by slumber sweetly quelled Now and then, lifted in a child's surprise, Murmured, and soon from all the long day's ache Slipped into sleep; but Raymond stayed awake. Bold was his heart; yet extreme tenderness For that dear heaven enfolded in his arm Sharpened his fond thoughts to a strange distress, Threatening his secret storm-encircled charm, As by the violent waters walled from harm Amidst the whirlpool's roaring heedlessness A stillness keeps, most perfect, yet so frail, That in an instant shattered it may fail. Then he bethought him of what laughter dead Had under those old rafters leapt and rung; What companies of joy had banqueted; What lovers listened and what ladies sung: Here had they dwelt, been beautiful, been young! He bent in tears above that precious head Slumbering, a thousand times more dear than life, By him, and whispered, “O my wife, my wife! “Alas! what eager hearts and hands once wrought This chosen place to fashion and adorn! And now their names are faded out of thought, And their fond toil neglected and forlorn. This is their grave. O would that it were morn! All my great love in this dark house seems naught, And I in a dead midnight-world alone, Save for thy dear heart beating on my own. “Beat close, warm heart, ere my sad spirit cower. From those dead bosoms not a single sigh! Year heaped on year, hour creeping over hour, The wilderness of silence spreads more nigh. And what a momentary moth am I! Beat nearer, heart! tell me I still have power To breathe, to move; I grow so faint and dead, So Time's wide seas weigh heavy on my head!” Thus murmuring with daunted forehead low Leant to her breaths, he listened to the rain. The gloom seemed living, seemed to tower and grow O'er him, a shadow among shadows vain. At last the thoughts grew cloudy in his brain; The young blood in his wearied limbs grew slow; His arms relaxed, and in his senses lulled The sadness faded, exquisitely dulled. Birds that have nested in tall elm-tree tops Sleep not more sound, when winds that rock them roar, Whirling dry leaves about the wintry copse, Than both slept now, while on the wild night wore. At last the storm ebbed and was heard no more, Save in brief gusts and sudden shaken drops: The dawn came hushed, and found each peaceful face Turned to the other in entranced embrace. Raymond awoke. It was the early light That stole through half-closed shutters o'er the room: With gleaming stillness it caressed his sight, And on the floor lay tender like a bloom. It seemed his own heart wholly to illume, Soft as a smile, and growing slowly bright, Spilled its reflected clearness everywhere Into all corners of that chamber bare. Slow in delicious languor turn his eyes Wondering around him. Still Giselda dreams; But all things else how new a wonder dyes! From the sunned floor the young light upward gleams, Hovers about the ceiling's coffered beams, And those deep squares of shadow glorifies, Smiling fresh colours on the cornice old And shielded corbels' rich abraded gold; Where underneath, in clear or faded stain, The walls were pictured with old stories fair: The selfsame walls that, prisoning his pain, Gloomed yesternight so desolately bare Now blushed and gloried in the morning air, More beautiful in Time's enchanting wane, As leaves by spoiling Autumn fostered few Treasure the wonder of her tenderest hue. On the left hand there was a wild seashore, And Hero, leaning from her turret lone, Gazed out impassioned where the surge upbore Leander's face turned fainting to her own. Careless of chill spray through her deep hair blown, She stretched her arms, never to clasp him more. Even now his hands were tossed up in the foam, But from his eyes his soul leapt towards its home. Upon the right flushed Cephalus hallooed, Parting green thickets; knew his spear had sped, But knew not yet the white doe of that wood Was his own Procris. Low her piteous head Lay on the grass; her bosom brightly bled, And her lips trembling strove, while yet they could, To pardon the dear hand that wrought that wound, While dumbly she caressed his whimpering hound. These upon either end wall were portrayed; But in the midst was Orpheus with his lyre, Singing to the ear of one beloved shade, Lost somewhere in those aisles of gloomy fire. Only for her he poured his soul's desire: Yet the grim Pluto hearkened as he played, And Proserpine remembered the sweet spring, And with wet cheek besought him still to sing. Eurydice, through darkness music-drawn, Was gliding (none forbad her) toward his feet; And other ghosts like, in the earliest dawn, Sparrows that stir and raise their restless tweet, Stole fluttering, because of sound so sweet, Over the pale flowers of their shadowy lawn, Lifting their drooping heads as they drew nigh; And all those faces listening seemed to sigh. Love, whom no goal, no haven satisfies, Love hungered and athirst, bound, scarred and lame, Proud rebel, who through fading mortal eyes Shoots beams of that clear fire Time cannot tame, Burned here in suffering flesh his beacon flame. Ah, who can read these passionate histories, Nor feel vibrations as of music roll Ennobling challenge to his kindled soul? Raymond beheld them; and it seemed all time, Till now a cave of dimness, without hue, Flushed back love's colours from its farthest prime, Claiming the sacrificial fire anew From his full heart. Nay, every age foreknew This moment, and the dumb years seemed to climb Patiently growing toward this latest hour That bore his own love like a folded flower. He hung above her slumber, and he spelled Upon her face the still soul unaware. A whiter throat than Hero's sorrow swelled Shone faint beside the flame-brown wave of hair: But on her cheek the blood's clear tinge how rare! And the red mouth, how sweet a song it held Asleep until the living dawn should rise Brimmed in the perfect sunbirth of her eyes! O surely here the dead world's shadow-brood Of spirits yearning from the misty tomb Hung o'er the presage of earth's coming good, And poured for her their prayerful hope, in whom Life triumphing wore all their ravished bloom— Soft image of immortal womanhood, For whose dear sake the world waits in its need, And heroes of the farthest age must bleed. Raymond gazed on, and could not gaze his fill, Rapt on a silent stream of thought afloat. The soft light stirred not; all the house was still; Only at times with negligent sweet note A thrush without would fill his freshened throat, Where the sun slept on the warm window-sill, And in translucent leaves of trailing vine Melted his glittering rays to golden wine. Giselda's face gleamed in the shadowed light. He bent to wake her; then again delayed, Lingering upon the foretaste of delight. “O you dear spirits,” suddenly he prayed, “Whose hearts imagined and whose hands arrayed This home in beauty, ere you turned to night, And having shed your grosser mortal part Live in the beatings of the gazer's heart! Peace be upon you, peace for ever be! Let my lips bless you, whose bright faith unmarred Shows me the core of my felicity, And who, though deep in drear oblivion barred, Committing Sorrow into Beauty's guard, Pour your immortal ardour into me: To such a faith all my desire I vow, May it burn ever as 'tis kindled now! Wake, love, awake. O thou art grown so dear, Yet in the enriching beams of this new day So glorious a spirit, I almost fear That from sleep's prison thou wilt soar away Beyond the stretching of my arms. Nay, nay, I'll hazard hope for truth. Love, I am here, Shine out thine answer from these opening eyes, And lift my soul up into Paradise!” Enraptured thus, he kissed her. She awoke. Her gaze that wandered, anchored upon his In happiness, and dreamingly she spoke: “Do I sleep still? Or what fair house is this?” Smiling, he answered with joy's perfect kiss, And raised her up and wrapt her in her cloak. So both stole forth. The still world seemed to lie Their radiant kingdom under the wide sky: Young was the morning, and their hearts were high. SANTA CRISTINA At Tiro, in her father's tower, The young Cristina had her bower, Over blue Bolsena's lake, Where small frolic ripples break Under a grove of sycamore On the sandy eastern shore. There one clear May eve she sat Leaning over the rich mat Hung across the window-sill, While her doves with eager bill Fluttered round her for the grain In her spread hands; up again Now they soared through golden light, Radiant in a swerve of white, Round the trees, now scattering With a shiver of many a wing, Soft as snowy drops of foam Singly they alighted home, And swaying each a sheeny throat Crooned their comfortable note. On a sudden another sound Smote Cristina from the ground. Bending over, she espied Wretched ragged folk, who cried, Hoarsely: “See, the doves are fed; We, men and women, have not bread.” While Cristina, with a shy, Courteous simplicity, Looked upon them, her young heart, New to sorrow, felt the dart Of pity pierce her body through, And she spoke: “What must I do?” Then with a thought her bosom beat, And swift away on frightened feet To her father's chapel, rich With images in carven niche, Breathless and bright-eyed she sped, Most in dread of her own dread, Traitor to her purpose; took The idols in her hands that shook And brought them gathered in her gown And from the window cast them down. The ragged people cried and snatched This broken treasure; then were matched Strange companions: here the bust Of gazing Jupiter august Weighed on a sore-blotched cripple; there Against a scullion's clouted hair Apollo's silver shoulder shone, While, near by, a withered crone Hugged into her bosom old Venus' arm and breast of gold. Mumbling o'er their spoils they went, A troop to stir the merriment Of gods; but sad Cristina sobbed. When the stately father robbed, Entering found his pagan shrine Emptied of its works divine, Each by a famous craftsman wrought, Chosen well and dearly bought, And suffered only to be scanned (With fond touches of the hand) By the nice appraising eye, Duke Urban cried a grievous cry: But when at last he understood The crime of his own flesh and blood, Grief was swallowed up in rage. “Pest on this corrupted age!” He cried. “This is this new god's work. And now I find the venom lurk In my own child, in my own home! I am a citizen of Rome. She shall have justice: take her hence, And let my dungeon teach her sense.” Cristina weeping pleads the pain Of the famished folk; in vain! Straightway she is cast and bound In a dungeon underground. Three days went. “Now bring her out,” Said Urban. Servants, much in doubt, Led her from the dungeon door, Much in doubt yet wondering more, For the damp and starving gloom Had but glorified her bloom, And her brow was brave, as she Stepped before her father: he With a sullen doubtful glance Some moments looked on her askance. “Art thou taught?” at last he said. Proud she lifted up her head. “Father, if I wronged thee, thou Didst mar the face of mercy. Now, By God's grace, thy cruel wrong Hath but made my soul more strong. I have suffered for thy pride: Let thy poor be satisfied. See, God stands upon my side!” Duke Urban flushed an angry hue. “Wilt thou brave me to thy rue, Child?” he cried. “Since in thee still Some imp of evil works his will, Pricking thee outrageously, I will burn him out of thee. Go, build a furnace; bind her in, And let the flame purge out her sin.” All her women wept, implored, “Ah, be merciful, dear lord!” But the more imperious came His answer: “Cast her to the flame.” When that evening fell, a light Rose and shuddered up the night. On the reddened shore around Soldiers kept the fiery ground, Where amid the furnace stood Cristina: spite of hardihood, None but turned away his eye To see so sweet a creature die. Swifter roared the bright fire, dancing Madder, on their armour glancing, While the people kneeling wailed. Suddenly all faces paled. In their ears a clear voice sang. From amidst the fire it sprang Joyous; and the soldiers raised Their heads, and all the people gazed; There in the moving crimson core Of the flames that sound and soar, Coil and quiver, twist and spire, 'Mid the insufferable fire, Like a breathing beauteous rose, Nay, like a precious vase that glows Outlined intense and clear and white, Absorbing all the burning light Into its tissue, through and through, To purify the shell-like hue, They behold Cristina stand, Lifting either little hand, And with parted lips, and eyes That the fierce flame glorifies, See her form transfigured shine Singing in that fiery shrine— An embodied rapture! Awe Fell upon all them that saw. The young voice melted in their ears, And beauty hushed them into tears. Heaven seemed opening on their sight To its inmost soul of light, And the daily world of woes Fell from off them, and they rose In a rapture: faces, turned Each unto his neighbour, burned, While they cried with voices full, “A miracle, a miracle!” Urban in his dark tower heard Trembling that exultant word. Rage by stabbing terror spurred Swelled his heart to madness. Straight With a torch from the open gate Striding he commanded: “Curst Be this snake that I have nursed! She has witched to her desire A demon lover, a fiend of fire; Yet she shall not 'scape me now. Ere another night, I vow, She shall die. With morning take And throw her deep into the lake.” Though men groaned and women shrieked At such cruel vengeance wreaked, None this old man's rage gainsaid; For within their hearts they prayed Some new marvel should confound All his fury. Morning found, On the glimmering shore assembled, A great multitude that trembled Half with hope and half with fear, Hemmed behind the levelled spear Of armed ranks; and over all, Ringed by silent lances tall, In a high seat Urban sat, By threatening fingers pointed at, Motionless with eager frown And on the wide lake gazing down. Soon the sun's uprising glowed Over the eastern hill, and showed, 'Mid the waters that anew Shivered silvering into blue, A single boat; it brightly shone Where Cristina knelt thereon, And the hangman at her side Busy bending over tied Round her neck a great mill-stone; In the water she was thrown. Passionate arose the groan From those watchers, but as soon Changed into a pæan's tune; For she sank not, but was seen, Where death's bubble should have been, Standing on the stone that bore Her bare feet floating toward the shore, With little tremblings at the knees As the buoyant, urging breeze Rocked her onward. With a shout Thronged the people, stretching out Eager arms, or under spears Thrust their heads with joyful tears, Clapped their hands and cried to see So magical a wonder. She, Simple in her loveliness, By one hand holding up her dress From the wave that washed its hem With white sparkle, seemed to them Fresh as Venus on her shell Borne o'er the blue Ionian swell. Round her head the soft-blown hair Played in sunny streams of air, Save one long tress on her breast That her clasping fingers pressed. In a dream she heard the cries, Saw the bright and crowding eyes Near and nearer; when a strong Sudden tumult rose; the throng Turned, and lo! on his high chair, 'Mid the spearmen struggling there, Duke Urban with head fallen back And the full vein swollen black On his throat: his fingers tear At the suffocating fear That holds him by the panting heart Breathless, and his fixed eyes start, While the heaving hubbub round Rocks about him; in hoarse sound Of vengeance his death-gasp is drowned. But Cristina floating nigh When she saw this, piteously Bowed her gentle forehead low In her hands, and cried, “Ah, woe On me and mine! O Lord of Peace, Now my wretchedness release!” Even as in despair she prayed, One that on the shore delayed At the crowd's edge, watching all And doubtful what might yet befall, Scowled and said within his teeth, “This witch-girl comes to be our death,” Strung his bow and spurred by fear Drew an arrow to his ear, And while still this fierce uproar Held the wild throng on the shore Sharp upon the tender throat The iron barb Cristina smote. Ere a man had turned to note, She was falling; ere a tongue Had one cry of warning rung, She had fallen, and the foam Tossing shoreward washed her home. As a sudden silence rushed Over lips in terror hushed, Rolled amid the shallow spray At their feet her body lay. Dark is the world to the weak will As to feet stumbling on a hill Benighted, when no stars appear. But as a star that beacons clear, O beauty of courage, thou dost shine On souls that falter and that pine. But most in bodies frail and young Is thy beauty seen and sung. There, like a fountain ever new, Thou dost scatter sunny dew, Troubling our self-bewildered night With simplicity of light. Therefore is Bolsena's lake Dear for fair Cristina's sake. Yea, the stone that bore her feet And still bears the footprint sweet, Housed in alabaster shrine Of carved work, as a thing divine, And by dead lips' kisses worn, Shall be kissed in sorrow's scorn By lips of thousands yet unborn. PENTHESILEA I. THE COMING OF THE AMAZONS Dark in the noonday, dark as solemn pines, A circle of dark towers above the plain, Troy sat bereaved; her desolation seemed To have drawn slowly down in sultry drops The sky of gathered and contracted cloud, Hung silent, close as is a cavern roof, That deep in heavy forests, lost from day, Echoes the groans of a hurt lioness For her slain cubs; she fills her den with groans, Stretching her hoarse throat to the flinty floor; And with like lamentable echo, barred Within the great gates, dirge of women swelled Along the dark-door'd streets that lately shone With Hector's splendour as he strode to war, Wailing for Hector fallen; upon towers Unchampioned men grasped idle spears and groaned. But in the heart of Troy dead silence dwelt. There to a temple, throned on a green mound, Andromache was stolen; there she bowed Her widowed forehead, pressed upon the strength Of a square pillar; not a sob, nor sigh Passed from her, but immovably inclined She waited yet expected nought; that hour Of grief was on her, when the exhausted flood Of passion ebbs, and the still shaken heart Hungers for staunching silence: then the touch Of patient cold stone is desired like bliss. So mourned Andromache, unmoved to know If earth that lacked her Hector, still endured, Absorbed into the vastness of a grief Only by its own majesty consoled. Crouched at her feet the child Astyanax Played on the slabbed floor with the creviced dust, Or followed with soft parted lips and eyes Bemused, the foiled flight of a swallow's wings That, strayed within, sighed swiftly up and down The temple gloom; there was no other stir In that hushed place of stone, while the slow day Declining moved the sullen cope of heaven With westering breezes; under brooding cloud Light newly trembled; looking up, the boy Saw wide sheen in the portico that laid Long shadows from the pillars. It was then A faint and clear sound in the distance rose, He knew not what, but wondered, as full soon Troy seemed to stir and waken; it drew nigh Up the steep street, a noise of horses' hooves Numerous and gallant with the ring of arms. He rose up, and on soft feet tripping stole To the porch-pillars, looked forth, and returned Bright-eyed, back to his mother; thrice he twitched Her robe, ere she perceived; then slow she turned Her face down on him; bending so, she changed As a sky changes when the unmuffled moon Steals tender over April's vanished rain; And love, older than sorrow, filled her eyes A mother's, not a widow's now. With awe In his quick voice the boy cried, “Mother, come! The Goddesses ride up to fight for us.” Andromache smiled on him; though she heard, Scarce sought to understand; and yet it seemed Those soft lips brought an answer from afar As oracle or dream to her sad soul, That long had waited; she too heard that sound, And as impetuous freshet in the spring Breaks on a stagnant stream, the bright blood-warm Extravagance of hope shot like a pain Through her dulled body; then her heart recoiled On doubt and trembled, though the noise now near, Mingled with cries and swarm of running feet, Drew her steps on; beside her pressed the boy Exchanging wonder with his mother's eyes, Till on one knee she dropt, and holding him In jealous-clasping arms close to her breast Looked to the door; now thronging heads appeared Beneath the temple steps; and they beheld Framed in the wide porch men and women pass, And over them, proceeding proud and fair, Like goddesses indeed, a wondrous troop That glorified the sunlight as they rode With easy hips bestriding their tall steeds, Whose necks shone as they turned this way and that, Bold riders on bold horses; light mail-coats They wore upon loose tunics, over which Where to the throat the stormy bosom swelled A virgin shoulder gleamed; for now the fire Of evening, struck back from the temple wall, Burned ardent hues upon them, moving past Untamable as their own steeds that moved With them, and beautiful with ice-bright eyes, Glancing around them strange, and tossing hair; Flashed upon bronze bits of the horses, flamed Along smooth brown wood of their javelin-shafts To the bright points, and radiantly repelled From hilt and helm, glowed changing upon shields Like moons in August, like a hundred moons Of moving brilliance; scarves of coral red Blown from the baldric, trembled like the fire In eyes that kindled the beholder's soul To presage of what fury these fierce queens Should madden with, when they were loosed to dance The dance of battle, matched with men or gods, Wild as the white brooks when they leap and shout In tumult, tossing down the wintry hills. So filled with wonder the thronged faces saw Those terrible and lovely huntresses, Mid whom one rode yet queenlier than the rest, With steadfast eyes superb; a spirit crowned She seemed, the votaress of some far desire; She turned not like the others, but rode on Like one that follows a star fixt in heaven, Fixt as her thought is; whom beholding now Mourning Andromache with closer arms Entwined her boy; her heart was full, it pressed Against her side, invoking that strange hope That here was the avenger of her loss, A sword brought from afar; she leaned at gaze, Following that form, impassioned to divine What purpose charmed her from the world of men, When lo! the street was empty, all had passed. She rose and with uncertain motion stood, Swayed like a slender poplar when the south Tremulously bows it, over her dear child, Who clung upon her fingers looking up Wide-eyed with joy: together they went forth. Already fast as over an ebb shore The fresh tide rolls up with a rising wind Invading dry ledge and deserted pool, And ere the seaward rocks be overstormed, Streams gliding with a soft stir far inland, So fast through Troy the stir of rumour ran To every hushed house; every chieftain heard Indoors and sent forth messengers to see. Even to Priam's palace it was borne. Then there was hurrying through the empty courts, And women drawing water at the wells Set down their pitchers; boys ran out; it seemed As if a city of sleepers sprang to life, A thousand beating hearts. Priam alone Heard not at all, for none was with him now, But solitary in that pillared hall Where he had feasted with his glorious sons In days of old, sat patient, mournful, rapt, His chilly limbs warmed by a cloak's long fold, In such December solitude of mind As when the last leaf glides to frozen earth And all the boughs are bare: the days to come Were darkness, and the past days like a sea Of roaring waters; vacant unto each He mused upon the evening gold that fell Aslant a pillar's roundness, holding up One hand against the fire that burned beside. He heard not, saw not, though without the sound Of opened gates and murmuring hubbub fast Increasing on the distance, gathered in As to the silent centre where he sat Alone in gloom, nor noted how behind Came stealing steps; Cassandra first, the shunned Of all the happy, who yet disbelieved The fate of her foreseeing; others next Of Priam's house, mid whom the heavenly eyes Of Helen, like a mirror to the doom Coming on beauty till the end of time, Shone in their sadness; beautiful she leaned On fair flushed Paris of the golden head. They as they entered stood expectantly Pausing, although the King still sat entranced, Clouded in sorrow's deep and distant reign; Until Cassandra touched him on the arm And his eyes woke; a sad, astonished gaze He lifted; in that moment the far door Was opened: lo, upon the threshold gleamed The splendour of an armèd Amazon Coming towards him; her eyes sought his own: Slowly, and yet without a pause she came; And those that saw her deeply breathed; she moved As if a clearness from within inspired Her motion, challenging their inmost thoughts. Simplicity ennobled all her ways; The heart leapt at the turning of her head; But in her eyes a soul, deep as the night Filled by the beauty of assembling stars, Night on lone mountains, could shine out sword-keen As now, though touched for Priam's woe she gazed, While, slowly stirred, he lifted up to her His brow, and it was kingly: now he seemed, Though seated, in his stature to resume Old majesty; for princes of the East Had sued to him, and Asia sought his word To hearken to its wisdom. Some few steps The Amazon approached; at last she spoke. “Art thou the royal Priam?” “What seek'st thou,” He answered, “of an old unhappy man?” “I seek,” her voice rose ardently, “to bear My arms against Achilles in thy cause, To hazard in the venture all I may For Troy and thee, O King. This is my quest.” Proudly she spoke; but he, as old men will, Because he wondered, was displeased, nor knew How to rub clear the dimmed sense of his grief, And pausing half incredulous replied, “What hast thou said? Abuse not these old ears. Thou know'st that I have suffered—who art thou? A woman! Art a woman, and would lift Thy hand against Achilles? Never hand Of man prevailed against him yet, and thou A woman made to bear and suckle babes,”— “A woman,” she broke in, “but not as those Who spin at home and blench to see a sword. Penthesilea am I called, and am An Amazon, and Amazons I rule. They call me queen; but I like them was reared To suffer and to dare; my body bathed In cold Thermodon can outrace his speed; And I have slain the lion in his lair, Yea, and have fought with men and have prevailed.” Admiring murmur followed on her words, From those that hearkened with hope-kindled eyes. Priam said only “Hector fell.” That word, Slow-spoken, not to her, but in the dark Of his own grieving mind, dropt like a stone Down a well's echoing silence. There was pause. Just in that moment stole Andromache Over the threshold; then her heart drank wine, For she beheld Penthesilea there, Moved but not shaken, like a Goddess stand Of all regarded, while her spirit seemed To swell within her on some secret wave Of strength, and lifting up her queenly head She spoke like music through the darkening hall. “One certain night I stood upon our hills Before the dawn was come, and I beheld All the stars over me from south to north And east to west, each in his place, as they Had shone before I was or thou, O King. And as I looked, one fell: far down the sky It shot in fire to nothing. Who might think One of heaven's splendours, fixed in heaven, could fall? O Priam, even Achilles, even he, This far-renowned one, shall be overthrown For all his glory and his might, perhaps By hand unguessed, and thou behold him fall, It may be by another, or by me.” Yet Priam would not be persuaded, nay, Clinging to his old lamenting thoughts, he cried: “There was none brave as Hector, and he fell, Hector is fallen; snap all swords in two, Break all your bows asunder, as my heart Is broken: it were better. What avails? What wouldst thou, Queen?” Yet even as he spoke, Gazing upon the noble Amazon The strong bonds of his grief were loosed awhile. There seemed a courage in those shapely arms, In that clear brow, which to refuse might be Unpardoned of the gods: her clarion words Rang through him still; and as a traveller tired Vacantly resting at the long day's end Under the hollow of a stream's high bank Hears rushing over him the beat of wings And sees a wild swan snowy-throated take His effortless great flight in the sun's beams, So Priam saw her! bound afar to lands Of morning, like the beauty of those wide wings, Free, where he might not follow, left alone In the fast-falling night; but oh, not so, Not bound afar, but at his feet, with eyes Of proud petition, of a sweet command, Penthesilea like a vision stayed And her voice breathed one silver summons, Hope! A hush took all who listened, then they stirred. Only Cassandra, crouching by the King, Hid her dark face; the others, nearer drawn, Looked upon Priam, and his soul was moved, But not as they; his gaze now at the full Answered the clear magnanimous regard Of her that spoke with pity, as he replied, “What sad word hast thou uttered! Oh, thy lips Are young that shape it, ere they understand. Look on me that was once called happy, Queen! What knowest thou of ill? I have borne more Than my young fears, stretched by some childish wrong, Imagined that the whole world could contain, Or this frail flesh that pens us in our place Find possible to bear. I have been taught. None was so blest in sons, and none so curst. And now I know not if the Gods be kind Or if 'tis the last cruelty they use, That having heaped such evil on our heads They lend us power to bear it. O speak not! For I can teach thee how men learn to bear; 'Tis not with fortitude of hope increased, 'Tis with dulled sense that thickens on the soul And all its longings pined in frost that cramps The quivering heart up, till it feel no more. I am so knitted in harsh fortune's root As tottering towers, in bitter fibre bound That props what it has killed. Yet I endure. Why wilt thou trouble me? For thy young face Pricks with its courage like reviving blood In a numbed arm. I was at peace, O Queen.” He ended, and the glorious Amazon, Moved even to tears, stept toward him and knelt down And touched his knees, entreating: “Let me learn, Even though the price be of such utmost pain As thou hast tasted: I would prove my heart, That is prepared for all things: let me go! I am not all so ignorant of grief. Grant me this boon, that I may fight for thee.” Priam heard marvelling; bending o'er her, soft He laid his old hands on her youthful hair, Answering: “Is thy heart so fixed indeed? Ah, child, is not life sweet? Turn again home In honour, for so surely as I live And as Troy stands, thou shalt have honour here. The hazard is too much. I, that have ploughed This heavy and hard furrow into Time Cannot turn back, but thou canst. Wilt thou not? None shall reproach thee. O too much ere now, Too much, too dear blood in my cause is spilt. And thou art dear and shalt be always dear And thy name named with blessing in my house.” Penthesilea lifted up her head. She looked on him and smiled. “I thank thee, King. And thou art wise and I am foolish, yet Though Heaven in thunder did forbid me this My heart is fixed.” Then Priam sighed, she rose, And he made answer: “Be it as thou wilt And I will say some good thing of the Gods Since they have raised a woman's heart so high. Bring torches, for the Queen shall feast with us This night, and on the morrow if she will Go with our battle forth. Bid Troy prepare.” So Priam ordered, and the chiefs obeyed. Through all the city ran the word for war, And swords refurbished gleamed in kindled eyes At hope of help unlooked for: Troy was glad, And all the Amazons that night held feast Among the captains in the torch-lit halls Of Priam's royal house. At his right hand, Admired of all, Penthesilea sat, Still in her bright mail, though unhelmeted; For when she had bathed, they brought her women's robes But she refused; for in her heart she thought, I shall be deemed but as a woman is And they will put no faith in me for deeds. How strange the hush was of the glimmering room In a high tower apart, when after feast And song were ended, and all gone to rest, Penthesilea sat beside the bed Whereon her coat of mail, now laid aside, Shone keenly crumpled into glittering folds Next the smooth texture of a coverlet Embroidered in dim Indian town with shapes Of golden lions thronged by suns and stars; A Tyrian rug was soft to her bare feet When kneeling by her side Harmothoe Had loosed their sandal-thongs, and bathed them both In warm clear water from a brazen bowl; Who now was gone; and the Queen, left alone, Stood up, and let the loose white robe fall free, Holding her strong hands clasped behind her head, While through their fingers streamed the heavy hair: She sighed,—a fierce sigh panted from her breast, Like some imprisoned leopard's, ill at ease In those rich walls that held her from the air, And with faint subtlety of old perfume Wrought on her sense remembrance, as through dream, Of what dead women fair in idle hours Had here adorned them, pacing with soft feet The coloured stones inlaid upon the floor, Parting these curtains with their silver rings To gaze upon a mirror, kneeling down Beside the ebon coffer, to search out Within its depths of robe laid over robe Some beaten armlet of Assyrian gold, Jade-brooch or branches of rose coral brought From far bays of Arabian Astabel; Foreign and fair devices; dream on dream, In the low lamp-flame's wavering, oppressed The panting free heart of the Amazon. Thus as she leaned with heavy-lidded eyes Backward, and into grandeur slow rebelled The strong mould of her breast beneath the throat, Andromache stole in to her; she stood With wondering gaze fixt faltering in the door A moment, then, hope trembling at her lips, While the warm blood rushed up her cheek, she ran Swift to the other's knees, and falling cried, “O Goddess, help! Ah, surely thou art come From heaven to avenge me, for the gods in heaven Loved Hector well; thou hast a woman's shape But mov'st not like a woman, no, nor look'st. O certify my heart, my wounded heart! Fill me, for I am empty; turn again The water of life into this stony bed Where my days used to run. I am alone. Reveal thyself, if to none else, to me.” Penthesilea with stern looks amazed With both hands on her shoulders put her off, Saying, “Who art thou? What wild thought is thine? Rise up, kneel not, embrace not so my knees, My arms are stronger, nay, look up, behold,” Then with a milder voice continuing, “I am no goddess, feel, my heart beats quick; I am not calm as the gods are in heaven. This flesh is mortal, strike and it will bleed, Has bled ere now; and feels thy wound and throbbed To hear thy supplication, and to see How like a bird thou droppedst to my feet!” Andromache sank backward on her knees, Wide-eyed with fearful doubt, then slowly rose And stood apart, cold now as if despair Had closed about her sudden as dark night; Like thunder-drops her words fell desolate: “O my great hope, how easy was thy lure, How sweet and now how bitter to my taste! The folly of my fond heart bites my heart. The gods are loth to be revealed when they Take among men disguises: but oh no, Thou art a woman, thy face speaks the truth. And yet, yet, if a woman, whence and why Comest thou, what madness pricks thee so to dare What scarce a God might compass, when my own Great Hector whom none else could vanquish fell?” But now the Amazon regarding her More earnestly, spoke heedless of her cry, “I saw thee in the hall where Priam was. Art thou not Priam's daughter?” “Hector's wife,” Answered the other. “Then I know thy name, Andromache men call thee; and I know Thy wound: sit by me, be my friend to-night, Tell me of this Achilles, I would know What manner of a man is he who sounds In the world's ear so terrible. Is he Fair-haired, as I have heard, or swarthy-cheeked Like those men I have matched my strength against, The Gargareans? Do his inches tower Much over mine? How goes he into fight? On horseback, as we Amazons, or afoot? Or standing in a chariot hurls his spear? Tell me of all these things, that I may know And be aware and in the battle take What vantage may be mine among the Greeks The better to avenge thee, if fate will.” Andromache said no word for a space, Facing her with dulled eyes and mind confused; Then to her lips a word outleapt her thought Fledged with a bitter meaning: she exclaimed, “Thou lovest him!” The queen laughed, a scornful laugh, “O woman, have you none but woman's thoughts? Because you are weak and have such clinging arms,— I felt them soft and trembling round my knees— Deem you such weakness rules an Amazon? What is this love you are so quick to find The key of all you cannot understand? To tremble and to wait on a man's mood And seek I know not what bliss in his arms That fondle you a plaything, far from all The thoughts that make him strong! Such thoughts I have, Such will to tame and conquer, such delight In battle, such resolve never to yield My soul to any other's servitude. Love, love! Think you I have been wont to bathe My body in snow-brooks to temper it True as a sword-blade, slept on forest leaves, Raced the wild colts to break them, chased the deer, The lion even, seen the red blood spirt Of men into whose murderous eyes I looked And did not quail, think you that such as I Have hung my life's joy on another's smile, Pining with fancies such as in close walls You women fill slow days with feeding on, Who lie upon soft couches and dream dreams?” She ended with an anger-burning eye Standing dilated in her beauteous scorn Over against Andromache, who shook Her head, distrustfully insisting still, “Yet, yet thou lovest him.” Suddenly a fire Swept o'er her and impatiently she cried, “When thou hast borne a man-child, speak of love! Thou knowest not, thou, though in thine ignorant heart The blind beginnings of that selfsame power Compel thee where it wills, where thou wouldst not. Thou hast not loved, thou hast not known a man, Yet a man's glory, a man's imagined form Has drawn thee from thy mountains even here, To meet him face to face. Ask thy heart why! Hate, hope, fear, longing, 'tis all one; 'tis love Betwixt a man and woman. Ah, didst think, Penthesilea, to escape? But now Necessity has overtaken thee. Achilles masters and o'ertops thy mind Who wouldst be wooed not with soft words but spears. And thou must seek him. To thy wooing go! But oh, thou goest into a fell embrace, For he will clutch thee as a hawk a hare, And thy bride-bed shall be the bloody ground.” With that harsh word she would have turned to go But stayed upon the threshold; for the voice Of Penthesilea called her, changing now To a deep cry, not angered nor in scorn But grievous, as though suddenly her heart Imperiously swelled beyond its bounds And loosed its secret storm and sweetness out, The proud voice breaking into truth and pain. “No, no! not so, thou shalt not leave me so, Thou dost not know me; far away thy words Fly over me, they hurt me not at all. Yet, didst thou know my heart—I am not wise In love, thou say'st, yet I am wise in grief. 'Twas not Achilles drew me; it was grief That drove me hither, grief brims up my heart And blinded me to thy grief: sit by me, Andromache, and hear me: nay thou must. I had a sister, whom indeed I loved, For we were twinned in thought and act and soul, My bedfellow and playmate; oft have we To one another brought a timely arm Faint in the heat of battle or of chase. But oh, it was this arm, that should have first Withered on the shoulder, this right arm that sped The bolt that slew her, my Hippolyta! She had outstript me on the woody hills Hunting a hind that fled us; I saw not; But where the boughs were stirring in the brake I drew my bow, the arrow leapt, I ran, Parted the hazels, and beheld her there Lying beyond, the arrow in her side, Where still I see her on soaked yellow ferns Under a thorn, trailed with black bryony, So near a pool, the fingers of her hand Could touch the trembling harebells on its brink. She bled within,—there was no blood at all To soil her body that still seemed to live— Nor gave a cry, but with one hand she beat On the wet ground a little, then was still. But when I took her by the hand, it hung Cold in my grasp, though close I cherished it, And kissed her cheek, her mouth a hundred times, Calling upon her name, Hippolyta: Calling the dead that heard not.—I have seen When Euxine on a sudden rises black With storm, a sail that sought our haven swept Out into darkness, from the cliffs have watched How it flew onward fearfully, far out Blind under sheets of tempest and was lost. From that hour I drove like that driving ship Borne on, I recked not whither, over wastes Of time that have no harbour and no peace. I fled, and yet I feared being thought to flee. Therefore did I imagine to my soul Some dear atonement that should make my name Burn on the lips of men; set up my mark And that pursued, till the usurping hope Of glory with a glozing tongue sometimes Flattered my dark thoughts to forget: but oh, It is myself that am pursued, the hounds Of memory are upon me,—Break this off. Too much is spoken. Yet my heart is eased. Forget this weakness, tell not to another Penthesilea's sorrow, for from now She puts it from her, she is strong again. Nay, from my childhood up 'twas in my soul The dearest hope to do a thing of fame. To-morrow I will slay thy husband's slayer, Or gladly, if the fates refuse, will die.” While she was speaking, sad Andromache Changed in her countenance, her soft bosom swelled And her eyes brightening were soon dimmed with tears. At last she broke forth: “O unhappy Queen, Pardon!” But ere another word could pass Her lips, there was a babbling cry without, Soft feet came running to the door, and there Parting the heavy curtain, stood the child Astyanax, who ran to her and called, “O Mother, I have found you. Come to bed; I woke and could not find you, and was afraid.” The old nurse following at his heels began To chide him, but Andromache embraced Her boy and kissed him; he looked wondering up Now at the Amazon and spoke in awe, “It is the Goddess, mother”; when again She hugged him close, and gentle came her voice, “Penthesilea, pardon! I have erred, My hope was blind and my despair was blind. I dreamed of Gods come down to succour me. Lo, here is my avenger!” and she held The boy before her, while the warrior queen Admiring his bold limbs and fearless gaze That wandered to the splendour of the mail Lying on the bed, uplifted with a smile The sword beside it, saying, “Wilt thou fight With such a sword when thou art grown a man?” Whereat he gravely answered to her face, “Yea, I am Hector's son.” Andromache Drawing him towards her, with warm kisses, spoke: “I keep thy father's sword for thee; but now Thou must to bed and sleep. Sleep also thou, Penthesilea; and to-morrow morn Eat with me ere thou go, and thou shalt have All such as Hector's heart delighted in When he went forth to battle. Fare thee well.” Penthesilea was alone. She turned; Lo, in the corner the moon's wandered beam Lay gentle, like the soul of solitude. She drew a curtain; over earth the night Rose naked; and she looked with longing eyes Past the low plain, where Simois wound his stream To choke in marsh mist and the creeping ooze, Up to the mountain tops, and far beyond Saw in her memory clear a certain glen Where snows among the pale cloud gleamed above Crag-pines, but from the spongy mosses sprang Tall ash and chestnut, plundered by the gusts Of autumn to let fall gold leaves adrift Upon the young Thermodon, that between Gray boulders, dancing in his frolic race Over the abrupt edge of a gloomy gulf, Leapt and was lost; but lost in splendour! so Should her life be ennobled in its end, Lifting her heart she prayed, and in her mind Knew how, removed from all that others use And have their joy in, she must fix her course One way, since exiles in the world of men Heroic hearts are unto the end alone. II. THE BATTLE Waters of Asia, westward-beating waves Of estuaries, and mountain-warded straits, Whose solitary beaches long had lost The ashen glimmer of that sinking moon, Listened in darkness to their own lone sound Moving about the shores of sleep, when first A faint light stole, and hills in the east emerged, A faint wind soon, born upon ocean, blew; The cold stars faded; high on forest slopes The goatherd woke in his thatched hut and shook His cloak about him, striding forth, and saw Pale over the round world of shadow tower The silently awakened presences Of Rhodope and Ida, dawning peaks Far opposite, that slowly flushed, till all The hill-thronged vales streamed out in sudden gold He saw the young sun ripple into fire Propontis, and the bright seas run like wine Into the dim west where aerial snows Of Athos hovered o'er a hundred isles; Nearer, Troy towers stood gleaming; in the plain The river smoked with mist, and cranes in flocks Rose through the sun-soaked vapour toward the sea Beyond the trench and trench-encircled huts And black-beaked Danaan ships upon the strand. There in their huts and tents the Danaans woke, And streamed abroad in the keen morning air, But armed not yet; their camp made holiday, With shields hung up, with heads unhelmeted. Greek challenged Greek to hurling of the quoit, To wrestle and race; not a sole trumpet rang, For Troy since Hector's slaying kept her gates Fast-barred, nor sent her files forth to the war. So now the battle-weary Greeks prepared Their meal beside the trenches, eased at heart, When single scouts came running from the plain: “Arm, arm!” they cried, “for Troy will fight to-day, The Amazons are come to succour them.” Then sportful laughter leapt from mouth to mouth Among the gay-eyed youth, mocking to hear, And one to another shot a mirthful word. “The hawk is dead, the twittering swallows come To harry us! We will go garlanded To battle and will hale these women home.” So as for sport they armed; but ere the word Had run through half the camp, Thersites rose, Filled with his dwarfish malice that rejoiced In quarrels without causes between friends, Pleased with the comedy of angry wits When wisest men show weakest; he arose Glancing from side to side in evil glee, And went along the sea-beach till he came Where lay Achilles and his Myrmidons Who pitched apart, a separate host; he went Alone, for all despised him, though they feared His tongue, and coming to Achilles' tent Called to him with a gibing pomp of speech. “Hail, son of Thetis, slayer of thousands, hail! Hear what fresh tidings echoes through our camp! Thy fame is flown into the Asian lands, And how thou didst, a goddess helping thee, Hew Hector down, provokes the envious world To emulate thy glory. Lo, to-day Troy's latest hope, there comes to challenge thee A woman.” Then Achilles laughed aloud, But he continued: “Nay, it is a queen, Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons, Brings her wild squadrons to this faint-heart Troy, A queen of fame, with courage like a man's And more than woman's beauty. Agamemnon Already in his gloating thought adorns His palace with this all-outshining gem Captive to him. O Eagle of the Greeks Doth not the quarry please thee?” But again Achilles laughed: “Come, yet another day I shall have peace and leisure from the fight. I wore a woman's robes once, feigned their ways In Scyros, and I know them, quick to fire Upon imagination of a deed That blazes through them like a strand of flax Left light as ashes, fluttering, when the hour strikes For doing what a man's heart leaps to do. On such Achilles draws not. Get thee gone, Thersites, let the Greeks fight if they will With these mad women: but my heart is stirred To be alone and think upon the dead This day. Thy wry face puts me out of tune. Begone, thou crookedness, ere thou be driven!” So trudging back with ill smiles on his mouth Thersites went, well pleased to bear bad news. Achilles stood at his tent-door; the sea Before him smiled; but heavy thoughts like rain Clouded his darkening spirit, as his eyes Looked homeward toward the far Thessalian coast Where he was nurtured in fresh upland glens Of Pelion, and his father even now Kept his old age, watching uncomforted; But most the thought of dear Patroclus' dust Drew his soul down to sorrow; pacing slow The shore he came to where the mound was heaped On those beloved ashes; there he bade Fetch wine, and poured libation to the dead. There came a runner hasting from the camp, Who cried: “Achilles, arm! The battle joins; And half our host, yet unprepared, recoils Before the onset of those Amazons Whose horses rush upon them, and they cry, Where is Achilles? Arm, and bring us aid. 'Tis Agamemnon sends thee this command.” But Peleus' son looked frowning and replied, “Go tell the King I heed not his command Nor any man's; to-day my sword is sheathed.” With that he turned him to his grief; the peal Of distant horn and crying of many cries, All the harsh drone of battle muttering swelled Beyond the trench and rows of stranded ships Half-sunk in sand, that with their rampart shut The beach into its calm of little waves Falling and hushing; but to Achilles' ear That roar was vain and hateful; and he drew His cloak over his head, and cried with groans, “O to what end, what end? Must our souls beat Their high-attempered force out, and keen edge Blunt in a senseless turmoil, but to make A pageant for the Gods? O friend, I lose How much more than thyself in losing thee! Have I appeased thy ghost, and given thee sleep By my so great revenge? Yet am not I Appeased. Because in courage and in strength The Gods have made me excellent beyond All other sons of men, this is my woe That none can match me, easy comes the crown Of glory, and I would toss it from my hand Into these careless waters, could I find Some stay and dear abode such as I found In those thoughts that together, O my friend, We held, and well-companioned, ever looked On through all days with never sated eyes. But now the splendour and the spur is gone. I hunger after thine untimeliness For which my tears were shed. O that these Gods Who smile on their calm seats in happy heaven Could be provoked to wrath and themselves come Against me armed; then were there scope and marge For this full fire to burn in, that consumes My soul in puny angers at the pomp Of Agamemnon's puffed authority. But me they mean for some inglorious doom, And even now, plotting my shame, have sent A woman to defy me!” Thus he cried, Pacing in angry grief the calm sea-sand, While still the noise of war, rolled nearer, charged The air with jarring clamour; noon was passed, And the sky strewn with slow clouds idly moved; But ever louder at the trench it rose. At last a second runner from the camp Came, and Achilles knew him as he ran; It was a youth from white Iolcos town, Of Peleus' kin; he sobbed forth breathless words. “Come to the trench, Achilles, come and see! Not women are these Amazons but wolves! Like Mænads, maddened beyond strength of men, They rage and with amazement bear us down.” So both went forth to the great dyke and looked Over the trench; then in Achilles' heart Grief straightway slumbered, and the cruel sting Of battle stirred in him: as one who sees A wild bright bay of angry ocean storm With thunderous upleaping, surge on surge, Black rampart rocks, filling the brilliant air With sound and splendour, and joy charms his eyes, So now rejoiced Achilles; not less fierce In onset than those waters snowy-maned, The Amazons on their wild horses rode Storming upon the stubborn infantry, And by them, thrice-inspirited, with shouts Of vengeance, the victorious ranks of Troy. Achilles looked far o'er the fray and laughed: “See how the sullen Ajax like a bear Stung by a bee-swarm, puzzles how to strike: But you shall see how these same Mænads fly When that I leap upon them. Say, I come.” Glad the youth turned, and ran back to the Greeks, And through them flew the word “Achilles comes.” Penthesilea through the press all day Had sought for Hector's slayer, and sought in vain, Though many a captain on her path in arms So tall, so splendid stood, that hope had sprung Not twice or thrice alone that this was he She should defy; the rest she scorned, yet some Essayed her prowess and came wounded off Or fell beneath her, and so trampled, died. Lo, as a potter strikes with eager hands Shapes of soft moulded clay, fired with the thought To make a thing more noble, so she smote Those meaner challengers, crushed idly down If haply from the wreck and tumult might Spring the desired Achilles; her bright axe Shone over shouts and groans and maddened more The tempest of those headlong Amazons Who rushed black-maned upon spurred horses, where The spears bristled the thickest. They outmatched The fury of impetuous Diomed, Who even now where fierce Antandra struck Hardly avoided, catching at her rein, And was borne backward raging in his beard With half his helm-plumes shorn away; with her Derione and Thermodossa, red With rapture of the sword, Antibrote, Hippodamia and Brontissa drave Like screaming gusts of whirlwind when the air Fills with torn boughs of cracking oaks, and pines Shiver to ground uprooted; thrust on thrust Met shrieks, where desperately tugging hands Clutching a spear were tost up suddenly As it stabbed home; strange-echoing female cries Exulted; in the van Harmothoe Called, as her axe-blows rang about her path Hard as the white hail when it strips the vines And their bruised clusters; the gay Danaan youth, Spoiled of their sweet imagined sport, laughed now But as the mad in whom no mirth is, driven Before the Amazons in pale amaze And terror of their beauty and their strength, While crest on crest the Phrygians followed on. But most all marvelled, friend and foe, to see Clear where the foremost onset hurled and clanged, Penthesilea like a star in storm That through the black rents of a burying cloud Rides unimperilled; for none stayed her, not Diomed, nor Ajax; yet her quest despaired; Achilles came not; something failed the hour, And ere he came 'twas lost: there at the trench In baffled frenzy the wild warring queens Perceived it in their hearts, and raged the more, Wanting the one goal's glory that should force Their last strength onward; by so much as they Began to faint, by so much more the foe Rousing his stubborn manhood, clenched his ranks And bore them backward. Then Achilles came. He leapt upon the dyke, bright as a brand Breaking to sudden fire; they saw him shine, They heard his great voice clear above the roar, And half the battle swerved along the plain Toward Simois. Far upon the city wall Andromache was gazing; now she pressed Her hands upon her bounding heart in fear; She saw her own host in the centre break Before Achilles and roll back; in vain Penthesilea on the seaward wing Maintained the onset; half her Amazons Caught in the frayed edge of the flight, were turned, Were flying; nay, it seemed that earth and heaven Joined in that altered combat and pursuit, For in the west the sun charged out of clouds And shot his rays forth over shadowy isles Set in the fiery seas, and flashed behind The Argives and their crested coming on, Dazzling the ranks of Troy, that broken now Reeled from the middle outward, here and there Stemmed by a chieftain's cry; with hot-blood cheek The youthful Troilus was storming, shamed, And shouted: “Rally at the river bank!” But now among the fleers thudding hooves, The maddened steeds of single Amazons, Headlong and helpless, thrice confounded them, In whom the terror of Achilles stung Sharp as a cruel rowel in the flanks Of those scared horses; uncontrollably Crushed, wrestling, groaning, trodden, all were hurled Together wild as from a foundered ship A hundred men, flung forth, one moment strive Huddled in the hollow of one tremendous wave, The next upon its crest toss up to crash Down upon rocks they agonize to shun: So desperate in a huge blind tide of flight Phrygian and Amazon together reeled. All in a moment they had reached the stream. A grove of oaks stood on the hither side, Where Troilus made rally some stout hearts Staying the rout. Woe then to him that fled, When in his back the pouncing arrow plunged And straight was bloody to the feathers! woe To him that fled, there was no help for him! Ingloriously he fell, or pressed by shields Of comrades from behind was beaten down, Or on the crumbling bank was crushed by hooves That broke the bones in many a breathing breast Of strong men, trampled like tall mallow stalks At the stream's edge, broken like leafy boughs That cracked and splintered in the whirling stroke Of swords; and many falling in the stream Meshed by long weeds were strangled in the ooze. Black-haired Antandra there, forced with the rout, Strove ever like a raging lioness To turn on her pursuers: on the bank She stayed her horse, and some Thessalian youth, Stung by her beauty, caught her by the belt And dragged her from the saddle; she, so spent, Let fall the axe from her dead-weary arms, But with sobbed breath caught him so desperately That both together in a blind embrace Fell plunging in the shallows, rolled among Marsh-marigolds; she thrust upon his face Under the water, laughed and strove to rise, When even then a javelin bit her breast And clove her through; so died Antandra; so Fell many another; pity there was none, For cruel is the anger of men shamed When they avenge their shame; and that fierce hour Made many a widow on far hill-town wall That golden evening dandling with fond smile A son already fatherless; and still Achilles' murderous and resistless hands Were stayed not. So by Simois the red flight Streamed swift and fearful as a fever-dream. But meanwhile upon either wing the war Swung doubtful, nay, the Greeks were overmatched, Wanting their champion, drawn with all his men So far dispersed, though now shrill trumpets rang Recalling them, for on the seaward side Penthesilea pressing hardly, she With the fierce remnant of her Amazons And gray Antenor, passionately smote As in a kind of anguish; like a net Trapping a lion's limbs, the battle closed Round her deep-thwarted spirit: Sthenelus Assailed her, striding huge among the rest; And riding at him, as she struck, the axe Crashed broken on his helm, she wrenched the spear From his stunned arm, when on the other side Leapt Ornytus against her, and she swerved To dart the spear-point through him, crying out, “O that thou wert Achilles!” All at once Clear from the distant battle's farther edge Sounded upon a sudden several horns, Harsh-blown bull's horns; Antenor knew the note Of signal, and he called across the spears, “Penthesilea, hark, upon the left The son of Aphrodite holds the day. Between us all the foe is locked and hemmed, And hot Achilles has pursued too far. Press, 'tis Troy's hour!” and even as he spoke The Greeks relaxed; but now, flushed from the rout, Those same pursuers singly and in troops Mixed in the battle, all confused, and swung A score of ways with half-arrested clash And crossing tides of onset; streaming loose In separate combats, or bewildered pause Where all was doubt. Penthesilea burned Amid the scattered mellay; surely now From Simois through the dust and disarray She spied a great crest and a blazing spear Returning, and Harmothoe cried out, “Penthesilea!” with so keen a cry That her heart leapt; she knew Achilles came. All knew, the spent arms and the shouting heads Were stayed and turned; they halted man by man As knowing the hour was other than their own, Awaiting in a thrilled expectancy, As a drawn bowstring ere the arrow fly, That strange encounter, not alone the shock Of chosen champions, but a storm of worlds Where the deep blood-tides, man and woman, met Penthesilea kindled, her soul soared Above the beating of her heart, alone Answering that high peril, that made pale The boldest round her, all their fluttered hope Afraid, as with a deep imperious cry And striding pace, through moil of crimsoned arms, Dinted and shattered shields, Achilles came Shining from head to heel; a demigod Whom smouldering anger dyed in fire, whose limbs For swiftness and for strength unmatchable Seemed but the prison of a spirit that, freed As a flame leaps in beauty to and fro, Splendid in indignation should have towered Against the lords of heaven; a spirit wronged, That for oblivion of its sore heart-strings Had robed itself so red in slaughterous deeds And as in scorn feasted on dying cries, Hot like a reveller seeking to forget; But as a reveller comes out into dawn Shooting bright beams up to the fading stars, So was it with Achilles when he found The royal Amazon; in ardour she Leaned on her reined horse forward, all her soul Ingathered at a breath, ready to launch And dare, as those together-leaping looks Like stone and steel flashed! To the fingers tense, She poised in one uplifted hand her spear Against him over challenging proud eyes, That quailed not where the eyes of kings had quailed. “Turn again home! Thou canst not fight with men, And least with me, whom no man overcomes,” Scornfully with a mighty voice he cried, “Madwoman, turn, or here thou spill'st thy soul!” Clear rang her voice back, “Put me to the proof! Have I not sought thee, Achilles, all this day, And having found thee, shall I let thee go?” With that she hurled, and the spear bounded forth Straight at Achilles' face, but lifting up His shield, he caught it on the golden boss That shivered it to pieces: his own spear Flew on the instant, the shock marred his aim, And not the queen he smote, but smote her horse Deep in the shoulder: with sharp shriek he reared And staggering fell; but lightly ere he fell Penthesilea leapt upon the ground, As swiftly Achilles plucked his weapon back. Pale grew the Trojans, glad the Greeks exclaimed, But she stood, deeply breathing, and her mind Debated if to draw her sword and rush On death at once; while marvelling to behold The beauty of the daring on her brow Achilles called, “Thou tameless one, be tamed! Else thou art dead, no god shall save thee now.” She answered, “Nay, thou shalt not think such scorn Of me that am a woman. Men are bold, All men are bold, and women are all weak, Thou think'st, yet when a woman's heart is bold, By so much more it can outmatch a man's As all her strength is in extremity, Sped like a shaft that stops but in a wound! Though but a woman, thou hast cause to fear And fear me most, because I stand alone.” She called undaunted, yet her heart despaired; When quickly came Harmothoe and thrust A second javelin in her hand; at which Achilles frowned: “Bold art thou, overbold; And surely as high Zeus on Ida sits And watches now, I swear none braver moves In this day's battle, nay, alone of all Worthy my strife. Be wise, venture not more.” He spoke, reluctant. But without a word She, moving in his path until she backed The low sun where he faced it full, upraised The spear, and cast at him with all her force. Then taken half at unawares, he swerved. On the left shoulder, near the neck, above The great shield's rim it smote and grazed the flesh, So that the blood sprang: like winged Victory The Amazon flushed bright, a hundred throats Broke into one loud cry, and the Greeks clutched Their swords, as that exulting murmur ran Trembling and echoing o'er the plain to Troy. There was such pause as when the ear waits thunder. Achilles' face was dark, yet lightning-lit; And all the ruthless eagle in his soul Called instant for her death; yet she was fair, Young, and a woman, and surpassing fair; But she had shamed him: as an eagle beats Towering against the mastery of a storm That blows him o'er a tossed lake backward, then Upon a lull swoops forward, so his wrath Leapt conquering on a sudden, and the spear Flamed from his hurling hand; she saw it come, She raised her shield, but through the shield it crashed Under the arm, through the tough panther-skin And plates of iron; in her side it pierced And bore her down; imperially she fell Without a cry, sank on lost feet, nor heard Achilles' dread voice, “Art thou satisfied, Penthesilea?” but the heavy shield Rang on her fallen, the helmet rolled in dust From her proud head, and the long, loosened hair Tossed one tress richly over throat and bosom Shuddering strongly up from where the blood Welled dark about the spear forced deep within; And sudden as a torch plunged in a pool Her face lay dead-pale with the eyes quite closed. Some moments held, still as deep snow is still, The hearts of either watching throng, for whom There seemed a glory fallen from the world Where she lay fallen, stirred not: spear and shield Were silent; then among the Danaans woke A cruel exultation as they saw The Trojan faces; and one cast a spear At random; harsh the shouts of battle rose. But still Achilles stood where he had hurled, Filled with besieging thoughts that in his brain Like thunder broke: he heard the cry and clang Renewing, and faced back upon his Greeks, Staying them sternly: wrath was in his soul, Wrath with those spirits despised, and wrath with her That had provoked him, wrath that his right hand Abhorred its own act, and deep wrath with heaven And fate; so darkened inly, like a storm He came, and standing o'er the fallen queen Gazed on the shape his wound had marred, a shape Where strength had into beauty thewed and strung Thighs of swift purpose, deep bosom and loins Largely imagined, a God's dream; such limbs As in the forges of desire should mould Heroes oh never now to be! So pale She lay, a life that might have with him soared Abreast, but all its world of hope a cup Quite spilled, a splendour ravelled and undone By his own hand who now, so darkly stirred, Saw her eyes open on him, full and strange. Imperiously, “O thou shalt live!” he cried; Flung his shield off, with a fierce tenderness Bending beside her to uplift the weight Of her resigning shoulder on his arm. But faint she moaned, “I thirst.” Then at his call One ran to where a stream welled near a bush Hard by; but quicker ran Harmothoe And brought her helmet brimming, which the queen Drank of a little, though the bubbling cold Of her own mountain springs hardly had eased The growing anguish of the wound; when now Among the Greeks murmur and strife arose, Where loud among the rest Thersites mocked. “See, lords of Hellas, see this prince you fame So high beyond us all, and fawn upon His all-contemptuous pride, shows his true heart. A fondler of soft women would he be, A Paris! Kills, and weeps on those he kills. We should have left him in his proper robes On Scyros, hollow braggart that he is. What is this woman she should baulk our fray? Let kites and dogs stay over her, not we.” But ere he ceased Achilles sprang on him, Flaming. “Thou toad!” he cried, and in an instant Seized with both furious hands and lifted him, Towering and terrible, above his head, And as a lion flings a snarling hound, Tossed him afar to fall with gnashing noise Horribly biting the blood-spattered earth. “Spit thy slime there, thou shalt not on a thing Less vile than thine own soul!” Achilles cried. And all the rest, half wroth, half shamed before The domination of his burning eyes, Fell backward. “To the trench and to your huts!” He called again. “Go, for the night comes on. You fight to-day no more!” He shouted stern; And one to another whispered in his fear, “The Gods have sent a madness on this man. Stir not his fury.” So they all retired, And on their side slowly the men of Troy Drew homeward: but alone Achilles came Back to the Amazon, propped on the knees Of sad Harmothoe, and darkling stood Over her, where she cast her eyes around And knew the earth and heaven but saw them strange; Saw the stilled armies and far towers, and light Upon the great clouds drooping sanguine plumes On Ida from the zenith over Troy, Where wept Andromache; brief evening burned One solemn colour o'er a world at pause: Last she beheld Achilles: in their eyes Meeting, the marvel of what might have been Was with that moment married, as a touch On thrilling strings wakes from the eternal void Beauty unending, but the excluded heart Heaves mutinous in pangs at the dear cost And pity to be mortal: pangs more keen Pierced now Achilles gazing, and in smart He cried, “Thou smilest!” for her countenance changed, Eased out of anguish under falling calm, A lightening and release. Now not on him Her dying eyes looked, not on him who stood Meshed in the wrath of his own fiery deeds, Passionate, yet transfixed, as if the power Of some Immortal had made vain his might And helpless his victorious hands; her head Sank, and her liberated spirit, where He might not follow, was already flown. THE BATTLE OF STAMFORD BRIDGE “Haste thee, Harold, haste thee North! Norway ships in Humber crowd. Tall Hardrada, Sigurd' son, For thy ruin this hath done— England for his own hath vowed. “The earls have fought, the earls are fled. From Tyne to Ouse the homesteads flame. York behind her battered wall Waits the instant of her fall And the shame of England's name. “Traitor Tosti's banner streams With the invading Raven's wing; Black the land and red the skies Where Northumbria bleeds and cries For thy vengeance, England's king!” Since that frighted summons flew Not twelve suns have sprung and set. Northward marching night and day Has King Harold kept his way. The hour is come; the hosts are met. Morn thro' thin September mist Flames on moving helm and man. On either side of Derwent's banks Are the Northmen's shielded ranks. But silent stays the English van. A rider to Earl Tosti comes: “Turn thee, Tosti, to thy kin! Harold thy brother brings thee sign All Northumbria shall be thine. Make thy peace, ere the fray begin.” “And if I turn me to my kin, And if I stay the Northmen's hand, What will Harold give to his friend this day? To Norway's king what price will he pay Out of this English land?” That rider laughed a mighty laugh. “Six full feet of English soil! Or, since he is taller than the most, Seven feet shall he have to boast. This Harold gives for Norway's spoil.” “What rider was he that spoke thee fair?” Harold Hardrada to Tosti cried. “It was Harold of England spoke me fair But now of his bane let him beware. Set on, set on! We will wreck his pride.” Sudden arrows flashed and flew; Dark lines of English leapt and rushed With sound of storm that stung like hail, And steel rang sharp on supple mail With thrust that pierced, with blow that crushed. And sullenly back in a fierce amaze The Northmen gave to the river-side. The main of their host on the further shore Could help them nothing, pressed so sore. In the ooze they fought; in the wave they died. On a narrow bridge alone one man The English mass and fury stays. The spears press close, the timber cracks, But high he swings his dreadful axe; With every stroke a life he slays; Till pierced at last from the stream below He falls; the Northmen break and shout. Forward they hurl in wild onset. But as struggling fish in a mighty net The English hem them round about. Now Norway's King grew battle-mad, Mad with joy of his strength he smote. But as he hewed his battle-path And heaped the dead men for a swath, An arrow clove him through the throat, And where he slaughtered, red he fell. O then was Norway's hope undone, Doomed men were they that fought in vain, Hardrada slain, and Tosti slain! The field was lost, the field was won. York this night rings all her bells. Harold feasts within her halls. The captains lift their wine-cups.—Hark! What hoofs come thudding through the dark And sudden stop? What silence falls? Spent with riding staggers in One who cries: “Fell news I bring, Duke William has o'erpast the sea. His host is camped at Pevensey. Save us, save England now, O King!” Woe to Harold! Twice 'tis not His to conquer and to save. Well he knows the lot is cast. England claims him to the last. South he marches to his grave. RUAN'S VOYAGE I The mist has fallen over the isles, And Ruan turns his boat for home. The wind is down; with an oar he steers The narrow races, where at whiles To left or right through fog he hears The low roar and short hiss of foam, As either rock-sharp shore he nears. Full glad at heart he guides for home, Full gladly looks ere night to reach The little haven, twilit beach, And pleasant smell of the green earth, That he has left three days ago; To warm both hands before the glow Of peats upon the cottage-hearth, Where his gray father will be mending The old nets, and his mother, bending Over the fire, at his step uplook From the pot that smokes in the ingle-nook. Is it a sea-mew's cry that calls Loud through the mist and wailing falls? Suddenly the white veil lifted, And in smoking coils was drifted. Ruan felt a cry ring through him. There on a jutting rock alone Stood a woman crying to him; White her hair was heedless blown; 'Mid gleaming surf the rock rose bare; Her withered arms were stretched in prayer. “Fisherman, fisherman, help!” she cried. Ruan turned his boat aside Swiftly in the eddying tide. “Fisherman, take me in thy boat And to my own home carry me, To the isle of Melilot That lies upon the western sea.” “How camest thou on this stormy strand, A barren rock that men avoid?” “Robbers came upon our land, Burnt and pillaged and destroyed. Half our women folk they reft, And me upon this rock they left.” “Where is this isle of Melilot? For of all the isles I know it not.” “Come hither and take me in with thee And I will guide thee across the sea.” Heavily Ruan thought on his home In Westerness across the foam; But he turned his oar and glided near; As it were his mother, he lifted her. She sat in the stern, cloaked and dim, And through the chill mist guided him. It seemed that day had never an end, It seemed that sea had never a shore, Such weary hours he seemed to bend Upon his never-resting oar, And felt the cold salt on his lip, And from his hair the vapour drip; But still the blank fog brooded round Over an ocean without sound. At last along the glassy seas Crept faint upon his face a breeze, And like a shadow soft and light Stole up a little wave that knocked Upon the stern; the boat was rocked; He looked, and O heart-stilling sight! She who sat there was not the same! Before his eyes the winter old Fell from her; the full hair outrolled In splendour soft as springing flame, Breathing out a perfume sweet, Over her shoulders to her feet. Now like a bloom her face became, Her arms and bosom rounded fair, And even then was Ruan 'ware Of blueness breaking the white air And his own shadow trembling there; And ere his tongue strove into speech The keel was grating on a beach. When mortals gaze on goddesses, So high the hope of our dreaming is, The wonder loses fear, the charm Drinks up the wonder; Ruan leapt Upon a shore in sunshine warm, And forth with him the Lady stept; And each to the other lightly talked, As 'twere their wont so, hand in hand, To wander through a lovely land. By solitary slopes they walked. The mist was scattered, but still before them Was blown in fleecy tuft and trail; And tremulous mid the melting cloud, Upon the bushes low that bore them Were crimson flowers that danced and bowed, And green leaves fluttered their edges pale. II In a moment's space behold The blue noon fell to evening gold. Suddenly before them stood A palace silent in a wood. A dream of the eyes when music fills the ear By night, and through the lulled brain ebbs and flows, Might build and colour so unearthly clear So fair and strange a house as rose On Ruan's eyes; such gleaming walls, Delicate towers and airy porticoes. Pillars of clear jade, whose pale capitals Like tiger's claws were ivory, smooth and bright, Upheld a lintel fair like fretted snows. The carved work by its shadow glowed distinct; No crevice but was brimmed with brooding light: Upon the roof a bird of Atlas blinked, Sun-drowned in splendour from the gorgeous West, And preened his plumes with languid crest; Open, beneath, a shadowy doorway stood; And fragrant smoke from fires of citron wood Beckoned to happy senses, and the guest Bade cross the threshold, enter, and be blest. By now they paused within a spacious room, Curtained about with glimmering tapestries, That in the hush and richness of the gloom Hung like a forest gemmed with fancied eyes. Pale tendrils twined about the clustered pipe Of reeds, and black trunks branched above remote To heavy fruit that hovered over-ripe Of fiery gold and dull vermilion stripe, A waste of boughs for wild birds' pillaging: And over dimness large leaves seemed to float, That here were spotted like a serpent's throat And there were greener than a finch's wing. It seemed to live, though all was whist, And Ruan gazing seemed to hear With heart-throb quickened into fear The drooping briars writhe and twist, The branches wave with stealthy stir Of dappled leaves or dappled fur— A sound as if the tangle hissed! He trembled as the room he scanned. The Lady clasped him by the hand. He looked into her face; she stole In that moment all his soul. “Fear not, fear not; all is thine, Ruan, so thou wilt be mine! I am Morgaine, whom mortals call Le Fay, And I have brought thee to my house this day Because I love thee and will give thee more Than thou hast dreamed in all thy life before.” With that she kissed him on the mouth, and he Was like warm wax before her witchery; And as she spoke the arras changed to view Tender and tremulous and clear in hue As April woods of white anemone; And in his heart fear died to joy anew. She led him on with willing feet. Through many a perfumed hall they glided; His brain grew giddy with that incense sweet, But still the smile of Morgaine guided Betwixt slim pillars, on a floor Of brindled coromandel wood, Where now 'twas scented dusk no more But airy peace calmed all his blood, For in the wall a window wide Looked out on magic eventide. Far, far beneath them a blue lake was cupped Hollow amid the twilight of a vale, And over wan mist floating frail A rosy mountain soared abrupt. Black pines and gold-green mosses there On rocks whose distance none could tell Were pictured in the soundless air And rivulets that faintly fell As in some gorge of Saianfu, Where from her porcelain palace-tower, Lone on a crag's mist-cradled throne, A princess leans amid the dew Of such a marvellous evening hour O'er balustrade and precipice, Her lute and woven silk laid by, Dreaming with a sudden sigh Of the world-enchanting kiss. With such a sigh was Ruan's bosom heaving, With such a sting of beauty past believing, When soft beside him spoke Morgaine, “Come, tell: O Ruan, doth my Kingdom please thee well?” “Princess, princess,” he answered, “I am blest Beyond all mortals: tell me thy behest And I will be thy servant.” But that word She smiled away; his arms leapt round her, pressed With mad joy, as she whispered “Be my lord!” III Morgaine, that lurest the souls of men that are greedy of joy, What soughtest thou out, Morgaine, in the face of a fisher-boy? Were the souls of the great ones of earth so easy a prey to thy snare, Lightly bound to thy hand by a single shining hair, That the simple heart of a youth, untempted, in hard ways bred, To thy siren hunger is sweeter than kings or captains dread? Thou sang'st him songs that lapped him in utter forgetfulness Of the green hills and the rocks and the waters of Westerness, Till Time, like a wandering light that is stayed on an opal, shone Kindled and many-coloured; the charmed days moved not on. His thoughts were borne as idly as clouds on the slow South, Or a willow leaf that glides on a wandering summer stream, And the light that bathed his body, and breathed so sweet to his mouth Was such as mortals know but in splendid rents of dream Piercing the cloud of sleep from the dull day-world beguiled. Together they sailed the calm of evening waters isled With knolls of gemmy grass, and thickets of nightingales; They gathered flowers and listened, and moved with drooping sails; And anon they rose from a feast, from close-embowered delights, To hunt the timid gazelles on passionate moonlit nights, Blue nights of milky stars, where fluttering petals snowed From windswept boughs and scented delicious dusk, and rode Home by shadowy glades upon soft invisible lawn Hand in hand through the dews of a shy dove-coloured dawn. They drank of a fairy wine, till their hearts were weary of earth, And them, embraced, the mighty wings of Phœnix bore Up through the light exulting to soar and still to soar, And the world dropped down beneath them; they clapped their hands in mirth Mocking the baffled eagle: but how should mortal tell What wonders Morgaine wove for Ruan in her spell To charm the nights and days with hopes that never tire, Morgaine of blissful body and eyes of far desire? IV Count the hours that bind and freeze, That break the breast and shake the knees! What need of Time's all-patient dial To him that drinks of this deep phial? These perfumed hours of white and red Flowered and were never shed. It might have been a morning's span Or twice and thrice the years of man: For Ruan was not Then nor Now; He was as young as his desire, as young As on sweet lips an old song newly sung. O idle thought to number how The days onrushed, the morrow flushed, Thicker than blossoms on an apple-bough. But on a morn at early dawn awaking He saw the cold light through the lattice breaking. A spider there her web had made; Softly in the air it swayed. Memory in a drowsy muse Lost and sought such filmy clues. Till upon a sudden plain In Ruan's vision, sharp like pain, Pictured was his home again, And the long nets, loosely hung From the white wall, stirred and swung. He rose and broke into a mournful cry, Which Morgaine heard with half-shut eye And caught him with both hands and strove To turn him with soft words of love, But he would not; so sharp a pang Of desolation in him sprang For all the dearness long forgot In his own kind's deserted lot; A tear fell from his eyelids hot Upon the marble floor below. He wept; and in an instant, lo! Beheld the floor transparent glow. Yawning, a spectral region shone Where cold abysses plunged betwixt Sheer mountain column-peaks whereon That very palace-floor was fixt. Ruan shuddered as he gazed. For toward his eyes were eyes upraised From human faces, forms that froze Within the rock-walls as they rose, A thousand forms, a prisoned host Imbedded in the mountain frost. But swift a storm of wind and fire Up those abysses roared and rushed; The shapes were stirred; a vain desire— As they would struggle, nearer, higher,— Their eyes awoke, their bodies flushed. And then the blast as sudden passed, The limbs of torment slowly sank To ice-green languor, fleshless bone, And starving ruggedness of stone; The life within them swooned and shrank To dungeoned attitudes again, Their half-closed upturned eyes alone Were gazing in the gaze of pain. With eyes of horror opened wide “Save me, save me!” Ruan cried. But Morgaine in her arms hath wound him, Her panting fierce embrace hath bound him, Her eyes exulting change and glow Like lights upon a shaken sword. She pants as in unearthly throe, Her arms cling tighter than a cord; How shall Ruan dare to brook The demon challenge of her look? “Listen, Ruan, canst thou hear How the whole world cries in fear? Lights not splendour in the air To dance above the world's despair? They toil in hunger, grief and night For our desire, for our delight— They the twisting roots, and we The topmost red flower on the tree!” But Ruan with both hands that pressed Against the burning of her breast, Trembled and groaned in that embrace, And strove from that exultant face, When soft she melted, sank before him, kneeled And clung, beseeching him that would not yield. “They are my flesh, my blood, and I Must go to seek them, or I die.” When Morgaine heard that lamentable cry She knew the heart of joy in him was dead, Looked in his soul and saw her hour had fled. “Go then,” she wept, “but come again To thy delight, to thy Morgaine. Yet if thou go, this casket take with thee; Hid in thy breast, 'twill guide thee safe to me Without a rudder o'er the wandering sea, But O beware thou never open this, Else art thou lost and all thy hope of bliss. Farewell!” she kissed him. “Farewell,” Ruan said, And took the casket with averted head, Nor turned him back, but swiftly passed the door Of the charmed house, and came to the seashore. V O what a calm as of old days come back With their old wont and clear untroubled way Lifted the heart of Ruan, on the track Of ocean steering for his native bay! Over blue waves the morning air sang sweet Full on his sail; he was all fire to greet The hearth of home, his father's joyful face, His mother's tears and tremulous embrace. He sailed beneath the summer's early noon With the warm favouring wind; and strangely soon Rose up the coast, till nearing on the swell He saw the dark waves glitter as they fell Against the cliff's worn bases, drained of foam. Now he is past the headland. There is home! The boats drawn up, the sands, and the green mound Beyond them; peaceful, sunned, familiar ground. It seemed he had not been three days away. With a light heart he beached amid the spray His boat, and moored it as of old, and sprang Ashore; a young girl to a baby sang, Sitting on fishing-nets spread forth to dry. She looked up, and her song stopped, and her eye Was filled with wonder; but impatiently Ruan ran up the beach, where he might catch The first glimpse of his father's cottage thatch. He came, he looked; and the heart in him failed. The house was not. What lonely strangeness ailed The world? He thrust his hand within his vest And felt the casket cold upon his breast. Helpless he gazed; but lo, there slowly came An old man with a stick, coughing and lame, Bowed by his years; then towards him Ruan ran, With a swift thought of pity, almost scorn, In his young strength for such old age forlorn, And cried upon the way, “Old man, old man, Where is my father? Surely thou know'st me; I am Ruan, Ruan! I am home from sea.” The old man lifted up his faint blue eye And peered upon him slow and curiously As on some strange thing from the sea upcast. “Nay, Ruan's name I know not,” came at last The answer. Ruan cried, “Dwell'st thou not here?” “Ay, all my life, three-score and fifteen year.” “And yet thou know'st not Ruan?” The old man Puzzled his withered brow as he began Seeking some far-sunk memory in his brain. “Ay, so it is,” he slowly spoke again, “They told a tale of Ruan; ay, 'tis so. How he was lost, but that was long ago, Hundreds of years, I think; he sailed away, And his old parents died of grief, they say.” He still spoke on: but Ruan heard no more, For he was wandering fast along the shore In the lone sunshine; aimlessly he strayed, Dazzled and indescribably afraid. On a sudden flamed a thought Through his body: straight he sought Within his breast the casket hid, Crying, “Morgaine, thou shalt tell, Though the answer come from Hell!” With trembling fingers he undid The silken cord, the golden lid. Lo, from the opened casket broke A stealing skein of purple smoke, A wandering faint cloud of perfume That rippled up in filmy plume, And lingered, faltering like a prayer, Then melted into sunlit air. Three hundred years had melted there, Three hundred years of faery bliss, Perished sooner than a single kiss! As Ruan stares upon the empty box, His outstretched fingers stiffen stark, His cheek is shrivelled, his eyes grow dark, Either knee together knocks; Ere he can pray, ere he can groan. Swift as grass in a furnace thrown, Or a crumpled clod in a heedless hand, He withers into whitened bone. Where his breathing body stood, Flushed with life and warm with blood Is a heap of ashes, a drift of sand, And the wind blowing, and the silent strand.</field>
