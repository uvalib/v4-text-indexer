Remembring how a Persian poore presented to his King, Of water cleare in homely handes from out the sprouting Spring: Because the King wel vnderstood, how Zeale in Gyuers thought, Exceeded far the simple Gift, the seelie Geeuer brought: Receiued it in gracious part, and thankeful was therfore, That such as greater Gyfts did gyue, of Th?ks deseru'd no more. Likewise (my Lord) with this poore gift your Honor I present: Example of the Persian Prince, I trust shal moue content. Your Honors Bountie towardes mee, more then I heere confesse, Compelleth mee in humble sort my dutie to expresse.

Looke not for fyled VVordes and Termes, nor Phraze that Poetes chuse: It is forbidden in this VVoorke, as thing not meete to vse. A Saphyre right no colour craues to set it foorth, you know: More baser Gold, more plainly set, more fresh the Gemme doth show. Heere haue I set (but not in Gold) a Rich and Precious Stone: Vnskilful though the same be wrought, my Payne yet thinke vpon. Not Payne so much, as my Desire the better sort to please: Nought els I craue, but your good wyl, these Labours myne to ease. In setting of this Pearle of Price wherein I do offend: Such faultes correct, as you them fynde, and show your selfe a Frende. SPE ET LABORE. The Hyue doth House the harmelesse Bee, That Hony sweete doth make: Whose little Limmes wyth Laboures longe, Still streyneth for our sake.

The holy Ghost, from vvhom thou doost this Heauenly Honnie Sucke, Direct thy Minde, and to thy Penne alotte most happy Lucke. Thomas Nevvton. THE ARGVMENT of this Booke. Thus mutch in Summe this present Woorke of Moyses doth declare, That God the Worlde, and Frame of thinges which therein formed are, Of nothinge did create and make: and how hee placed Man, This Tabernacle to behold, and wondrous Workes to skanne: Who vewinge these his gracious Giftes, should praise his holy Name, And Magnifie him Day and Night, entirely for the same. But Man forgettinge quight himselfe, and God that Rules on hye: Committed Sinne, displeased God, and stumbled wittinglye. Who through his Disobedience enthrald himselfe in Woe, And fell from God, from whom to him so many Giftes did flowe. This notwithstandinge, God our Lord for his great Goodnesse sake, Did him to Life restore agayne, and vnto Mercy take. And him confirmed in the same, by Christ the promist Seede: By whom, hee Sathan, vanquish shoulde, Death, Hell, and dolefull Dreede. The wicked sort persistinge still in their most froward wayes, (Forgettinge Gods great Benefites) most lewdly spent their Dayes: Yea, at the last so horriblie they fell from Sinne to Sinne, Contemninge Preachers to them sent, their Mindes from Uice to winne, That God, prouoked in his Ire, (so with his will it stood) At length did send vpon the Worlde an Uniuersall Flood. Assurance also here wee haue, by proofe before our face, Of Abraham, of Isaac, of Iacob, and the Race Of other zealous Patriarches, how that his Mercy great Doth neuer fayle them that be his, and for his Grace entreate. But lendes to them his helpinge hand, in all theyr tyme of neede: Hee cheereth them, relieueth them, and aydeth theim with speede. By Esau, Cain, and Ismaell, and others of like sorte, Who ruffled heere in worldly Pompe, and bare a stately port, It well appeares, the Church of God doth not depend, ne staye On worldly Estimation, nor Shewes of Tytles gaye. And by the Fewnesse eke of those, which haue from tyme to tyme Him worshipped in Sprite and Truth, (deuoyd of spotted Cryme) Wee are to learne, that it doth not consist in Multitude, But in the poore despised Flocke: and thus doth hee conclude: That Man in Wysedome hys, might bee confounded euermore, And that the Name of God alone, might praised be therefore. FINIS. A Hyve Fvll of Hunnye: Contayning the Firste Booke of Moses, called Genesis. Cap. 1. The Contents of the First Chapter. How Heauen &amp; Earth, the Light &amp; Skye The Sunne &amp; Moone &amp; Starres so hye, How Beastes &amp; Fowles, how Fishe &amp; Man, Created was of God, and whan. The VVorke of the first Daye. 1 When God, which no beginninge had, The Heau? and Earth gan frame, And voyde and empty it behelde, With darkenesse on the same: 2 And on y? Waters which hee made, that then aloft did stand, And ouerwhelme the Earth so farre, as yet appear'de no Lande: 3 Then at his worde, there Light came foorth, deuided from the Shade: And so the Eueninge and the Morne, by him one Day was made. The worke of the Second Daye. 4 The Firmament he fram'de and fixte Betwene the Waters so, As part aboue the same did rest, the other part belowe. 5 And gaue a Name thereto, and sayd, it Heauen shall called bee: The Eueninge, and the Morninge eke the second Day you see. The worke of the Third Day. 6 The third Day at his holy hest, the Waters vnderneth Compelled were together goe, in one place of the Earth. 7 And then the Land appeared dry, which Earth was called tho, And bade it should bringe foorth greene herbe, engendringe seede to groe: 8 And fruictfull Trees, of sundry sortes, that seede might still retayne, And bringe foorth fruicte, each after kinde that on the Earth remayne. 9 Thus euery thinge so came to passe, as God before did say: The Earth brought Herbe and Tree with fruict, that still ingender may. The worke of the Fourth Day. 10 And that there shoulde a diffrence bee betwene the Dayes, and Nightes, God bade that in the Firmament, there should bee placed Lightes: 11 Which should remayne from time to tyme appoyncted Signes to bee: As Day from Day, and Yeare from Yeare, in order as wee see: 12 The Sunne, hee made the Day to rule, The Moone, the Night to guide: And shininge Starres in Heauen hee set whose light doth aye abyde. The worke of the Fifte Day. 13 This Mighty Maker then gan saye, let waters nowe forth bring. Such Creatures as with life may moue, and Fowle to flye with Winge. 14 Upon the Earth, and in the Face of Heauen or Starry Skye, Straight way, both Fishe, and Fowle was made, in kinde to multiplye. 15 God blessed both, and bade them growe, the Fishe the Sea to fill: And feathered Fowle vpon the Earth, their kinde encreasinge still. The worke of the Sixte Daye. 16 Now let the Earth, bringe foorth (sayd God) each liuinge thinge by kinde: As Cattell, Beast, and worme that creepes, his power the same assign'de. 17 Thus when God sawe his handy worke was good, and pleas'de him well: Let vs make Man like vs, sayd hee, the rest of all t'excel: 18 To haue the Rule of Fishe, of Foule, of Catell, and the Earth, And euery creeping thinge on ground that lyues and draweth breathe. 19 And in the Image of him selfe did God Create him than, Both Male, and Female, form'd hee them, but first he made the Man: 20 And blessed them, the Earth to fill, their Sex still to renewe: And gaue them power vpon the Earth. the same for to subdewe: 21 And sayde, beholde, I haue you geuen of euery herbe to eate: And euery Tree, wherein is fruicte, likewise to be your Meate: 22 Also to euery Beaste on Earth and euery Birde that flies: And creepinge Worme, greene Herbe shall haue, to feede vpon likewise. 23 All what hee sayd, so came to passe, and he the same did see Ech kinde of thinge which hee had made. was good so for to bee. [Cap. 2.] The Contentes of the Second Chapter. The hallowinge of the Saboth day. The Flouddes fowre of Paradice gay: Howe in the same Man had his Seate: The Tree forbidden hym to eate. How Adam named Creatures all, How Eue was made, that first did fall, And how that Mariage did begynne, Betweene them twayne ere they did sinne. 1 Thus was the Heau?s, y? Earth, y? Sea, and Creatures all therein In sixe Dayes made: and in the seau?th did God, our God beginne, 2 To rest from all his Labours done, and Sanctified the same: To bee a Day of rest to Man, therein to prayse his Name. 3 God made each Plante in Fielde that growth, Before in Earth it was, And euery Hearbe before it grewe, and euery other Grasse. 4 And thus before that any Rayne vpon the Earth was founde, Or any man, to haue in vse, the Tillage of the Ground. 5 A mighty Mist, ascended vp from of the Earth, and so Bewatered the Face of all the Earth, and Ground belowe. 6 Then Man, that of the Earth was made a liuinge Soule became, By Breath of Life, that God did breathe, in Nosethrilles of the Man. 7 And from the first, God planted had, a Garden fayre to see: Wherein hee set, this Man hee made, the Keeper for to bee. 8 And from the Earth, God made to springe all fruictfull Trees, so plaste: As both might well the Eye delight, and please the mouthe in taste. 9 Two trees, amyd this Garden grewe by power of sacred skill, The one of Lyfe, the other was of knowledge, good and ill. 10 From Eden went a Ryuer foorth to moyst this Garden than, Which afterward, deuided was and in foure heades became. 11 And Pishon, is the first of foure. which round about doth goe The golden Land of Hauilah, Wher th' Onix Stone doth growe. 12 The second head, is Gihon cald, Which compasseth throughoute. The Land of Ethiopia, with water round aboute. 13 The third, is named Hydekel that passeth downe alonge The East, side of Assyria, Wyth myghty streame and stronge 14 And Euphrates, the fourth is calde Whych Fruictfulnes doth showe: And in the same do many Gemmes and precious Stones foorthe growe. 15 Almyghty God, this Adam toke and in this Garden set. The same to dresse, the same to keepe and of the Fruicte to eate. 16 Of euery Tree that therein was God bade him eate his fil, Except the Tree, that's in the mid'ste, of Knowledge good, and ill. 17 God sayd, that Day, thou eat'st thereof, thou for the same shalt Dye, Therfore see that thou touche it not, the taste thereof to trye. 18 It is not good (said God) that man should be alone I see: I wyll an helper make to him, companion his to bee. 19 Out of the ground, did God then make, ech beast vpon the Earth, And euery Foule in th' ayre that flyes, and all that draweth breathe. 20 And God did bringe all beastes and foules, to view of Adams Eye, Which was to see, what kynde of name, he then would call them by. 21 And Adam, called euery Beast, and euery Fowle by name, As wee do vse at this same day, to nominate the same. 22 In slomber then was Adam cast, and God a Ribbe did take, Out from his side, and of the same a Woman did he make. And fild the place with Fleshe agayne, and when hee did awake: 23 This is (sayd he) Bone of my Bones, and Fleshe of mine, I see: Virago shal shee called bee, as taken out from mee: 24 And for this cause, shal euery one, his Parentes deare forsake: And cleaue vnto his Wife alone, and both one Fleshe shall make. 25 Thus were they left in Paradice, all Nak'de, and vnasham'de: Because as yet no fact was done, by them for to bee blam'de. [Cap. 3.] The Contentes of the Thyrde Chapter. The Serpent, VVoman doth beguile, They both, and Man put in Exile. The subtile Serpent is accurst, From Paradice, all three are thrust, And Christe is promist for to come, To bee the VVorldes Redemption. 1 But yet the Serp?t fraught with guile, of subtilty had more, Then al y? Beastes God made on Earth to Eue, sayd hee, wherefore 2 Hath God forbidden you to eate, of euery Tree that growes? Which in this Garden fayre is set, whose Fruict so trimmely showes? 3 Not so, sayd shee, wee eate the Fruict of euery Tree that's here, Saue that which in the mid'st doth stande, wee do the same forbeare. 4 For God hath sayd, you shall not touch, ne taste the same to knowe: For if you do, then shal you dye, the Serpent sayd, not so: 5 You shal not dye, but be as Gods, and know both good and ill: Your eyes shall open bee to see and power to what you wyll. 6 And God doth know, what day ye taste the sweetenesse of the same, That you shal then bee as himselfe in euery thing to name. 7 The woman then the tree behelde that fayre was in her eye, And heard how eating of the fruicte, what knowledge grewe thereby: 8 She tooke therof, the same she eate, to Adam gaue likewise: So both did eate, and both did know and opened were their eyes. 9 So that themselues they naked sawe and were ashamed sore: They Aprons made of Fyggetree leaues for Couertures before. 10 Foorthwith they heard the voyce of God in Garden as hee went, And from his face they hyd themselues, For feare of beinge shent. 11 And in the coole tyme of the daye God called him and sayde: Adam where art? O Lorde I hearde thy voyce and was afrayde. 12 And hyd my selfe among the trees because I naked was: God sayd agayn, who told thee that? or how came it to passe? 13 Hast thou then eaten of the tree That I by death did threate? He sayd, the woman thou me gaue, Deliuered me to eate. 14 God sayd to her, why didst thou so procure to thee this shame? The Serpent (Lorde) deceiued mee, and I did eate the same. 15 Then God vnto the Serpent sayd, because this comes from thee: Cursed art thou aboue all beastes, that on the earth shalbee. 16 Upon thy bellye shalt thou goe, and creepe vpon the grounde, And feede vpon the Dust thou shalt, whyle lyfe in thee is founde. 17 I wyll (sayd God) twyxt thee and her, and twyxt your seedes also Set Enmitie, and that her seede thy head shall tread downe loe. And thou shalt tread it on the heele, thy mallice great to showe. 18 And God vnto the woman sayd, Thy sorowes shall increase And oft with chylde I wyll thee make, thy payne shall neuer cease, 19 Untyl such tyme thou hast brought foorth the fruict thou goest withall, And vnderneath thy husbands power, shalt subiect bee and thrall. 20 And vnto man, because sayd he thy wyfe thou hast obeyed: And tane and eaten of the fruict, which I to thee denyed: 21 The Earth in trauayle of thy hande shall alwaye cursed bee: In sorow shalt thou eate thereof and Thystles yelde to thee. 22 And in the sweat, euen of thy face thy bread shalt feede vppon Tyl thou retourne vnto the Earth, that thou once camest from. 23 For of the Earth, and from the Earth, thou Earth doest Earth remayne: And vnto Earth, thou Earth shalt passe, and Earth so bee agayne. 24 And Adam then vnto his wyfe by name of EVE did call, Because that shee, the mother was, of lyuing creatures all. 25 And God of Skynnes did Garments make and clad them both therein, And tauntinglye of Man thus spake, reprouing him of synne: 26 Behold, sayd God, now Adam is, as one of vs become, In knowledge both of good and ill, and all thats to be done. 27 Yet least he should eate of the Tree of Lyfe, and lyue for aye: God cast Man out of Paradice, the Earth to tyll alwaye. 28 And at the entraunce of the same God placed Cherubin, Wyth fierye Sworde the waye to keepe, that none might enter in.

Howe after this, Cayn had a Sonne: And of the Generation Of Henoch, and Mathusael, Of Tubal, Lamech this shall tell Lykewise of Seth, and Enos knowe The Generations theirs also. 1 Adam wyth Eue, together dwelt and hee his wife did know, She did conceiue, brought forth, &amp; said. in extreeme payne and woe: 2 I haue of God a man obtaynde and Cayne hee named was: And shee in tyme proceeded foorth, and so it came to passe, 3 That God her sent another sonne, which Abell was to sayne Who afterwarde, a Shepehearde was, a Plowman was this Cayn. 4 By tract of tyme it came to passe, that Cayn to God did bringe Such fruites as of the earth came forth, and thereof made his offring. 5 Abel the first borne of his sheepe, and of their fatte foorth brought Did offer vnto God likewyse, wyth pure and syncere thought. 6 And God did very wel accept, th' oblation Abel had: But vpon Cayns, God would not looke Cayne waxed wroth, and sad: 7 That in somuch almighty God, to angry Cayne thus sayde, Why frownest thou? and angry art, wherfore art thou dismayd? 8 Doest thou not know, if thou do well shalt well receiue thereby? If thou doe yll, thy Synne foorthwyth in open dore shall lye. 9 I saye yet notwithstanding this, let it subdued bee, And rule the same, and it shall happe much better vnto thee. Then Cayn wyth Brother Abel went and talked verye free. 10 They were no sooner in the fielde but cruell Cayn through spight Uppon his brother Abel fell, and did bereeue him quight 11 Of lyfe. Then God who saw the face of Cayne, demaunded where His brother Abel was become? but Cayn deuoyde of feare, 12 Sayd thus: I cannot tell: am I his keeper now become? Haue I nought els to doe? God sayd O Cayn what hast thou done? 13 The voyce and crye of brothers bloud from earth is come to mee, And as perteyning to the earth now cursed shalt thou bee. 14 Wyth open mouth the Earth did gape and did receiue therein Thy Brothers bloud, by thy hand shed, if thou therefore begynne 15 To tyll the grounde: she shal henceforth not geeue her power to the: And thou a vagrant Runnagate vpon the earth shalbe. 16 Then cursed Cayne thus sayd. O God, my sinne is more I knowe, Then that it may remitted bee, I haue offended so. 17 Beholde also thou hast me cast, out from the Earth this daye, And from thy sight a Uagabond must hyde my selfe alway. 18 And whosoeuer fyndeth me foorthwith he wyl me kyll, Not so, sayth God who kylleth Cayn seuenfold I punish wyl. 19 And then the Lord did put a Marke vpon this Caytife Cayn, That whosoeuer did hym fynde, should let him passe vnslayne. 20 And Cayn departed from the face of the almightye God: Toward the East syde of Eden: to dwell in Land of Nod. 21 Caynes wyfe by him conceiued was, and Henoch foorth brought shee, Sayd Cayn, this Cyttie now I buyld, shal lyke wise Henoch bee.

The cause of Floud that after fell, How God the same did Noah tell, And taught him how an Arke to frame, And hee in tyme preparde the same. 1 It came to passe when men began on Earth to multiply: And had begotten Daughters fayre, as might delight the Eye: 2 The Sonnes of God these daughters sawe in Bewty to excell: Did chuse amonge them all such Wiues as pleased them right well. 3 My Sprite (saith God) shall not still striue, with Man that's Fleshe, I see: For yet the space I wil them geue, iust Sixscore yeares shalbe. 4 Then after when the Sonnes of God Daughters of Men had knowne: And had begotten to them selues, men Children of their owne: 5 Those Children grewe, and Mighty were the strongest men of all: For in the World was none so badde, Men did them Giantes call. 6 But when that God Mens mallice sawe, on Earth increasinge still: And that the Thoughtes in heart of Man, continually was ill: 7 Hee did repent him that he made this man vpon the Earth, And sayd, his kinde he woulde destroye, and all that draweth Breath. 8 Both Man, and Beaste, will I destroye, and creepinge Worme (sayth hee) And Fowle that flies twen Heauen, and Earth, shall all destroyed bee. 9 But Noah was a righteous Man, and perfect in his wayes: Did walke with God, and in Gods sight founde fauour, in those dayes. 10 The Earth before the sight of God Corrupted then was founde: And all the Fleshe therein corrupt, (such mischiefe did abounde.) 11 Then God to Noah sayd, beholde, Before me now is come The ende of all the Fleshe on Earth, with her corruption: I will therefore vpon the Earth and them, sende out destruction. 12 But thou of Pinetree wood shalt frame an Arke well clos'de about, And Chambers let bee made therein, wel pitcht within and out. 13 This Arke three hundreth Cubits shall in length bee leuell streight, And fifty Cubits in the breadth, and thirty in the height. 14 A Windowe shalt thou make likewise, a lofte aboue in th' Arke: And in a Cubit compasse space, shall finishe vp that warke. 15 And in the side thereof prepare a Dore that open may: Also three Loftes do make therein, thy Stuffe, and Store to lay. 16 For I a Water Floude will bringe vpon the Earth so hye, That perishe shal all Flesh on Earth that vnderneth shall lye: 17 But I with thee, this cou'naunt make, that in the Arke shalbe, Thy selfe, thy Sonnes, thy Wife also, and thy Sonnes Wyues with thee. 18 And looke on Earth what euer lyues, thou thether bringe also, A payre of each, Male, and Female, with thee to liue and goe. 19 Both Birde, &amp; Beaste, &amp; Worme that creepes each couple in their kinde Shall come to thee, and in the Arke, shall lyfe and lyuing fynde. 20 And see thou take al maner meate, and store it vp by thee, That foode may be to thee and theym, when tyme of neede shalbe. 21 And as God bad in euery thing, so Noah brought to passe: Ech thing preparde, and did abyde What Gods good pleasure was. [Cap. 7.] The Contentes of the Seuenth Chapter. Of Noahs entraunce in the Arke, VVho went with him abourd this Barke, Also thincreasing of the flood, VVherein all things were drownd that stood. 1 And God to righteous Noah sayd, into the Arke now goe, And take with thee thy Houshold al, to enter in also. 2 For in this generation, I haue thee perfect found: A man vnspotted of thy lyfe, and in my doctrine sound. 3 And take with thee, of al cleane Beastes, iust seuen of eu'ry kinde, Male and Female, and of vncleane, as I haue thee assignde, 4 A payre of eche: of Birdes likewise, that flies in th' Aire aboute, Male, and Female, by couples seuen, of euery sort throughout. 5 That they on earth, their seede may saue: for seuen dayes hence, wyl I Upon the Earth send downe such Rayne, as all thereon shall dye. 6 And fortie Daies, and forty Nightes, this Rayne shall neuer cease, Tyl all on earth destroyed bee, through mighty Flouds increase. 7 And Noah did accordinglye, as God commaunded than: Six hundreth yeares, was hee of Age, when that this Floud began. 8 Into the Arke, then Noah went, on drye land as it stoode: His Sonnes, his wyfe, &amp; his Sonnes wyues, from water of the flood. 9 Of Beasts that's cleane and eke vncleane, of Byrdes and Wormes also, Came in by couples in their kinde, within the Arke to goe. 10 And loke what day God poynted had, the Water should appeare, It came to passe of Noahs lyfe, the iust sixe hundreth yeare. 11 And in the second Month therof, vpon the seuententh day, Were all the fountaynes of the depth, broke open by the way. 12 The windowes of the Heauens also, Were opened by and bye And forty Dayes, and forty nightes, it rayn'de continuallye. 13 When Noah and his three Sonnes nowe, were entered in the Arke, With Noahs Wife, and his Sonnes Wiues, and all aboord the Barke. 14 Then Beast and Catell in there kynde, and Woormes that crepe on grounde, And Birdes that flye, and Fethers beare, what els on Earth was founde: 15 Came vnto Noah in the Arke, by couples on a rowe: Male, and Female, of euery Fleshe, Which breath of lyfe did blowe. 16 The dore that in the Arke was made, which open yet did stand, God put it too, and shut it fast, with his Almighty Hand. 17 And then the Floudes began to swell, and Reine came downe withall, As forty Dayes, and forty Nyghtes, continually did fall. 18 The Arke which on the Ground yet stode, was now with water soft Borne vp, from of the Earth alowe, and went with Waues aloft. 19 And passed ouer tops of trees, so mighty was the Floode, That Mountaines stretching to the Cloudes, were cou'red as they stoode. 20 The Waters grew and did encrease, and that exceedingly, As did the highest Hilles surmount ful Fifteene Cubites hie. 21 Thus was all Fleshe on earth distroyd, Byrd, Cattell, Beast and Man, And all that had the breath of lyfe, on Land abydyng than. 22 Only Noah reserued was and they that with him went: The Flood preuayled til the tyme, thryse fyftye dayes were spent. [Cap. 8.] The Contentes of the Eyght Chapter. Noah sendes out a Rauen to seeke, And afterward a Doue most meeke, And when the Flood is come and past, They all depart the Arke at last. How Noah built an Alter faire, And Sacrifice did offer there. And of corruption naturall, In Hart of Man terrestriall. 1 And God that no tyme wil forget, such as do trust in hym, Remembred Noah in the Arke, and all that were therin. 2 And did a wynd bring on the Earth, which made the Waters cease, And stopt the Fountaynes of the depth, they should no more increase. 3 The Windowes of the Heauens aboue he shut, and they were still, And did forbid the Reyne to fall, and it obeied his will. 4 Thus when as three tymes fifty Dayes, expryred were and done, The Waters from the Earth agayne, did backe agayne returne, 5 And Noahs Arke of Monthes the seuenth, and on the seauentinth day, Upon the Mount of Ararat found place thereon to stay. 6 The Waters then decreased still and so could passe a waye, Until the .x. Month did begynne, and on the same first Day, 7 The toppes of lofty Mountaynes hye, began themselues to showe, By reason of the Waters fall, which then away did goe. 8 And after Forty Dayes were past, the Windowe opened hee That in the Arke was made, and forth he sent a Rauen to flee. 9 Which euer went, and came agayne, and found no place of stay, Because the Waters from the Earth, not yet wer gone awaye. 10 And after that, a Doue he sent, hoping therby to knowe, Whether the Waters from the Earth were gone away or noe. 11 And when the Doue long tyme had flowen, and footing none could spye, She did Returne vnto the Arke, the Waters were to hye. 12 And Noah then his hand put forth, and toke her in agayn, Where in the Arke amonge the rest, she longer did remayne. 13 And after seuen Dayes more were past, a Doue as erst was tolde, Agayn was sent, and in the Euen, within her Mouth, behold, 14 An Oliue leafe she thether brought late plucked from the Tree, Whereby the Waters he perceiu'd, abated for to be. 15 And Noah yet seuen other Dayes, did in the Arke remayne, And then a Doue be sent to flye, which came no more agayne. 16 Sixt Hundreth yeare and one it was of Noahs age: and Daye The first, of month the first, when as the Flood was dryde awaye. 17 And Noah toke the hatches of that on the Arke did lye, And stode and lookt vpon the Earth, the face wherof was dry. 18 So in the second Month it was, dayes Twenty sixe and one, The Earth was drye, and Waters all consumed were and gone. 19 Then God to Noah spake and sayd, come from the Arke and see, Bothe thou, thy Wife, also thy Sonnes, and thy Sonnes wyues with the: 20 And all the Beastes, that are wyth the, what euer Fleshe it haue, Foule and Cattel, andy Worme that crepes That I from Flood did saue 21 Bryng out with thee, that they the Earth, may once agayne possesse, And grow thereon and Multiplie with infinite encrease. 22 Then Noah came out from the Arke, and his three Sonnes also, His Wyfe, and his Sonnes Wyues likewyse with him from thence did goe. 23 And al the Beastes, the Wormes, and Foules, with Noah that went thether, Departed also from the arke, all of one kynde together. 24 And Noah then an Alter made, vnto the liuing God, And toke al maner Beastes that's cleane th' vncleane was him forbodde. 25 So of al sortes of Foules that's cleane he offered on the same, For Sacrifyce of thankfulnes, to Gods most holy name. 26 And as the Sacrifyce he made vpon the Alter brent, Almighty God wel pleased was, with swetenes of the sent. 27 And God in hart this promise made, the Earth no more to curse, For Mankinde sake: for Man is ill, and waxeth worse and worse 28 His hart can but Imagin ill, which from the first begonne: Yet wil I not al Fleshe destroye, henceforth as I haue donne. 29 Ne yet, saith God, shal Sowing tyme, and Haruest with encrease, Cold and Heate, Winter and Somer, ne Day and Night ere cease, 30 So long as any Man shall liue, or that the Earth indure, Though Man by Sinne and Wickednesse, my Wrath do stil procure. [Cap. 9.] The Contentes of the Ninth Chapiter. How Noah and his Sonnes were blest, Forbid to eate the Blood of Beast. Forbid also Mans Blood to shead, The law of Sword that striketh dead. A promise made, God wil no more, The VVorld with Floud droune, as before. He geues a Raynbow for a token, That to confirme which he hath spoken. Noha with VVyne is dronke become, He curseth Cham his seconde Sonne. 1 Almyghty God did Noah blesse, and his three Sonnes also, And sayd, increase and multiplye, and fil the Earth and growe. 2 The feare &amp; drede of you shalbee vppon al Beastes on earth, Upon all Foules, on Wormes and Fish, on all that draweth breath. 3 For all is geuen vnto your handes, and all that Lyfe doth beare, Shal be your Meate, and as grene her be so giue I al that's there. 4 Onely the Flesh that's with his lyfe, which is his Blood to name. Who so he be that eates therof shal perish in the same. 5 For verely the Blood of you, wherein your lyues contayne, I wil requyre it at your handes, the same to quyte agayne, 6 I wil requyre it from the Beast, that walloweth in the myre. From Man, and from Mans brothers hand, I wil Mans lyfe requyre. 7 What Man from Man doth shed mans Bloode putting the man to payne. By man lykewyse shal haue his Blood so shed and spilt agayne. 8 For Man is made lyke vnto God, commit not then such sinne: But multiply and bryng forth Fruite the Earth t'engender in. 9 To Noah and his Sonnes with him God spake and thus sayd he, A Cou'nant set I vp with you, and your Posterity: 10 And with eche liuing Creature els, that from the Flood was free, Both Foule, and Beast, and Cattel all and what so ere it bee 11 Upon the Earth that was with the, and from the Arke did passe: According eu'ry lyuing thinge, as then my pleasure was. 12 This is the Cou'naunt that I make, from henceforth neuermore Will I agayne the world destroye, With water as before. 13 And of my Cou'naunt this shalbe the sygne and token sure Twene me and you, and al the World, for euer to indure. 14 My Bowe in Cloud I haue there set, that when a Clowde shall falle, This Bowe therin shall then be seene, of liuing Creatures all. 15 And I wil not vnmyndful be, of this my Cou'naunt past, Twixt me and you, and euery Flesh, Whyles that the Worde shal last. 16 But stil will thinke vpon the same, and loke vpon the Bowe, The Token, Signe, and Seale most sure, of Couenaunt that I showe, 17 The Sonnes of Noah were but Three that from the Arke did passe, The first was Sem, the second Cham, the third yong Iaphet was. 18 And of them three, all men that be, or hath bene since the Flood, On Earthe haue sprong and shal so longe as God shall thinke it good. 19 This Noah, Father to the three, graundsire to Chanaan, Could digg the ground, and Uineyardes plant, and was an Husbandman. 20 It chaunced hym, so much to drynke, the Liccour of the Uyne, That in his Tent he naked slepte as ouerchargde wyth Wyne. 21 And Cham his eldest Sonne saue one, Father to Chanaan, Came in and sawe his father lye, asleepe and naked than. 22 Did see his Fathers Priuities, and laughed at the same: Went forthe, and tolde his Brethren both: and they wyth honest shame, 23 A Mantell on theyr shoulders toke, and so they backwardes went, And with the same did couer him, thus sleepyng in hys tent. 24 As soone as Noah was awake: and force of wine was donne. And wist well what yonge Iaphet did, and Sem his eldest sonne: 25 Hee would not curse this Cham his Sonne, which naked did him see: But sayd a thrall of Seruantes all yonge Chanaan shalbe 26 To brethren his: and God of Sem bee blest with lastinge praise. 26 To brethern his, and God of Sem be blest with lasting prayse. And God younge Iaphet blest likewise, with such increasyng dayes, 27 As he may dwel in tentes of Sem, and prayse the Lord therfore. And Canaan, shall serue them both, from henceforth euermore. 28 When Noah thus had geuen his curse on Ham, his second Sonne, And blessed both the other twayne, for that which they had donne. 29 When three hundreth and fiftie yeares after the floude was past, Euen then to God he made accompte, and gaue the Ghoast at last. 30 So all the dayes of Noahs liefe, to vs as may appeare, Before the floud, and after, was nyne Hundred, Fiftye yeare.

Come on therefore let vs descend, and myngle so their tounge: 12 That what one man to other sayth he shall not vnderstand: So by and by to passe it came, through worke of mightie hand. 13 Thus were they skattred on the Earth and left their worke alone, And ech one had a seuerall Speach, vnto him selfe anone. 14 Wherfore that place is Babel cald because confounded was The onely tounge of al the World as it so came to passe, 15 Also because they skattered were from thence on earth to fynde Some other place abroade to dwell, as God to them assignde.

How God did promise make, this Canaan to geeue To righteous Abr?, &amp; his sede, that after him should lyue, Into Egypt also, how Abram iourney makes, And how his wyfe he sister calles, &amp; name of wife forsakes And how for them God sent, vpon king Pharao His heuie, great, &amp; mightye plague, is here exprest Ã¦lso 1 And then the Lorde to Abram sayd, depart thy kinred fro, And get thee from thy fathers house, to'th Land I wil thee shoe. 2 I wyll thee make a People great, and mightie in the Land: And wil thee blesse and make thy name, so great on earth to stand: 3 That thou a blessing mayst be made, and who so blesseth thee, (Or shall thee curse, shalbe agayn so blest or curst of mee. For all the Nacions on the Earthe in thee shall blessed bee. 4 And Abram went, as God him bad, and Lot with him also, He was iust seuentie fyue yeares old, when Haran hee wente fro. 5 And Abram tooke his wyfe with him, and Lot his brothers sonne, And all the Goodes, which they had got. and by their traueil wonne. 6 Also the Soules with him hee tooke, which they begotten had In Haran, vnto Canaan they merye went and glad. 7 And when they were come to the land, I told you earst before, Abram to Sichem farther went and to the Oake of More. 8 To Abram ther eche Lorde appeard, and thus hee said to him, Unto thy Seede I geeue this Land, the which thou now art in. 9 With humble sprite did Abraham than, an Aulter newlye make, Unto the Lord that then appearde for his great Goodnes sake. 10 Then Abraham departed thence, and to a Mountayne went Which stoode by East of Bethel fayre, and there he pitcht his Tent. 11 This Bethel being on the West, and Hai vpon the East, To buyld an Aulter to the Lord there Abram thought it best. 12 And when hee had his Aulter built, and cald upon his name, He Southward tooke his iourney thence, and so did leaue the same. 13 And after this it happened so great a Dearth to bee, That into Egipt Abram went, to rest in that countrye. 14 And ere hee came the Countrye in, vnto his wife hee sayde, Behold thou art a woman fayre, and I am halfe afrayd, 15 That when th' Egiptians shall thee see, and know thou art my wyfe, They wyll by force take thee away and reue me of my lyfe. 16 Therfore to them I pray thee saye I am but Brother thyne: So I for thee shall better fare, and saue this lyfe of myne. 17 So soone as hee to Egipt came, the Egiptians did espie, The beautye of the Woman suche as did entice the eye. 18 And so among themselues they sayd, this woman sure is fayre: And Pharaos Lordes that her beheld to Pharao did repayre: 19 And of her beautie made report, and Pharao did require To haue her brought into his house, according t'his desire 20 Shee thyther came, whom when hee sawe, to Abram thus hee sayde, My Frend is this thy wyfe or not? or is she els thy Mayde? 21 O mighty Prince, sayd Abram then, Shee is not wyfe to mee, But shee a Mayd, my Sister is, and yet from Bondage free. 22 Then Pharao tooke her vnto wyfe, and did entreate her wel, And cherisht Abram for her sake, gaue him Sheepe, and Cattel. 23 And Oxen, Asses, Camels eke, of either kinde great store, Of men seruaunts, and maydes lykewise, and what he would els more. 24 But God upon king Pharao and on his house also, Did send downe great and greuous plagues til Sarai he let goe. 25 King Pharao then for Abram cald, and thus to him sayd hee, Why hast thou dealt thus craftely, and doubled so with mee? 26 Wherfore didst thou not say to mee, this woman was thy wyfe? Why didst thou saye she was a mayd and led a single lyfe? 27 For what intent shouldst thou tel mee, shee was thy sister deare? And caused mee to make her so my louing wyfe and fere? 28 But now (behold) there is thy wyfe, take her agayne to thee, And so departe that I and myne may from these plagues bee free. 29 And so be streightlye gaue in charge, his men should safelye bring Both him, his wife, and furniture, with eu'rye other thing. [Cap. 13.] The Contentes of the Xiii Chapiter. How Lot &amp; Abr? did depart, out fr? th' Egiptian l?d, How they their Cattel did diuide, is here to vnderst?d. The second time God promiseth, to geeue vnto Abram The Land that Lot and he went to, thats called Cana?. 1 Then Abram out from Egipt went his Wife and Lot also: And with th? tooke such as they had, and Southward did they goe. 2 And so fr? thence to Bethel towne whereas hee was before: Of Gold, and Syluer Abram had and Cattel eke great store. 3 And when he came vnto the place, where first he pitcht his Tent, And to the Aulter which hee made where sacrifice he brent. 4 Euen thereupon the name of God deuoutlye did hee call, And God him heard, and him preserude, so that he might not fall. 5 And Lot also with him that went, had Cattel, Tentes, and Sheepe. So that the Land not able was, the Heardes of both to keepe. 6 For why the Substance was so great, both of the one and other, As that they might not without stryfe there soiourne long together. 7 The Flockes of Sheepe, and Heardes of Beasts of eyther was so great, That both their Heardesmen fel at stryfe and did ech other threate. 8 Then Abram vnto Lot thus sayd, good Brother quiet bee, And let not any strife at all fall out twixt thee and mee, Ne yet betweene our Heardesmen now but louingly agree. 9 For why behold before thy face, doth all the Region lye, Take thou thy choyse and so depart which way shall please thyne Eye. 10 If thou the left hand for thy share, wylt well vouchsafe to take, The right hand then shal mee content, I wil it not forsake. 11 But if thou wylt, the right hand chose. I am content also To take the left hand that thou leaues, choose which thou wilt, and goe. 12 Then Lot lift vp his eyes to see, and viewde the countrye well, Which round about all Iorden laye, that somtime did excell 13 With goodly waters eu'ry where, til God for synne did shene Both Sodome, and Gomorra too which afterward were brent. 14 I say til then, this countrye fayre appeared to the sight Euen as the Garden of our God, wyth pleasure and delight. 15 And as the fruitfull Egipt was, in all respectes was this, Until thou come to Bela towne, whiche Zoar called is. 16 Then Lot well liking all the coastes, that were in Iordan syde, Did take his iourney from the Easte, and would no longer byde. 17 And Abram dwelled in the Land, that's called Canaan: But Lot in citties of the playne, tyll hee to Sodome came. 18 And in that tyme the Sodomites did Sinne exceedinglye In Pryde, in Lust, in Idlenesse, and fylthy Gluttonye. 19 And after that when Lot was gone, where hee desyerd to bee, Almighty God to Abram sayd, lift vp thyne Eyes and see: 20 And looke from place where thou art in, by North, by South, by Est, From poinct, to poinct, the compas rounde, a longe vnto the West. 21 For all the Land, thyne Eyes doth see, I will make thine to bee: And to thy Seede, for time vnknowne, that shalbe after thee. 22 And as the Dust vpon the Earth, which no man number can: So will I make thy Seede increase, aboue the reach of Man. 23 For who that number can the dust, that on the Earth doth lye, Shall then thy Seede accoumpt by tale, and certen number trie. 24 Arise and walke the Lande about, take vewe thereof, and see The length thereof, and breadth also, for I will geue it the. 25 So Abram then his Tente tooke downe, this sayinge pleas'de him well, And so went to the Oken groue, of Mamre there to dwell. 26 This Oken groue in Hebron is a towne in Canaan, Where Abram vnto God did builde an Aulter there to stanne. [Cap. 14.] The Contentes of the XIIII Chapter. This shewes of Lots Captiuity: And eke of Abrams victory: By whose successe it came to passe His Brother Lot, deliu'red was: Melchisedech with Giftes also VVyth Abram meeteth as they goe: And blesseth Abram in the way, To whom Abram, his Tythes doth paye. 1 It chaunced then within a while, in dayes of Nelams kynge, Whose name Rederlaomer hyghte, who wyth hym then did brynge 2 Three Princes great with puysant power, which came his parte to take, Agaynst fiue other Kynges to fight, his quarell good to make. 3 The first of three was Amraphell the kyng of Synear, The sec?d king was Arioch. the Kinge of Elazar: 4 The thirde the kynge of Nacions was. and Tidnall was his name, These foure did marche in battell raye, by Armes to trye the same. 5 Gaynste Beta, Kinge, of Sodome Soyle and Byrza of Gomora, Semeaber of Zeboim, and Shineah of Adma: 6 The fifth, the Kinge of Bela was, which Bela now we saye. Zoar to bee, where after Lot desir'de from plague to staye. 7 All those in Armes to gether met, where salt Sea nowe is founde, That then the vale of Shibden was, where slime pittes did abounde. 8 The cause of strife, and bloudy Warres betweene these Kinges that fell, Was that these last recited Kinges, conspiringe did rebell. 9 For, twelue Yeares space they subiecte were, and did their Tribute paye: The thirteenth Yeare, reuolted they, and did the same denaye, And in the next Yeare followinge, began the bloudy Fraye. 10 And or they met in Shibden vale, I tolde you erst before, Rederlaomer with his Power, destroyd the Countrey sore. 11 And smote with Sworde the Raphaims, which mighty Giauntes bee: Who gaue them selues to filtch, and steale, and liu'de by Robbery. 12 Hee smote the Susims, and Emims, the Horites eke, also Th' Amalechites, the Amorites, and many Countreys moe. 13 When Bera, and king Birza heard what mischiefe they had done, Howe Townes, and Citties were destroyed, and slaughter great begonne: 14 Then marched they to Shibden vale, with all the power they might, Did guide their Army in such sorte, as redy were to fight 15 With them the Kinge Semeaber, and Shineabe also: And Belas Kinge forth went as one to geue the ouerthrowe, 16 Against these fiue the other fower, their Battailes dyd empale, They all in fight together ioyn'de alonge in Shibden vale. 17 It so beefell the Sodome Kinge and Gomors Kinge likewise For feare did flee, and sawe their power fall downe before their Eyes. 18 And such as yet were left behinde, made speede to scape awaie: And to the Mountaynes fledde for life: forgettinge Battell Raie. 19 Redelaomer and his power, which now the better had With Sodoms, and Gomorrans goods, went thence away right glad: 20 And Lot likewise, with them they tooke, Which did at Sodome dwell: Of all the goods hee then possest, they left him nere a dele. 21 And one of them which had escap'te, to Abram ranne apase: And toulde hym all: &amp; how that Lot to them nowe Captiue was. 22 Abram with Mamre brother then of Escoll and Aner, Together these in perfect league confederated were. 23 Uppon this newes prepar'd themselues, and Abram forth him spedde, And Harnised his Yongmen freshe, borne in his house, and bredde, 24 Three hundred, and eightene were they, and euery one a man They all pursude the Ennemy, vntil they came to Dan. 25 And Abram there vpon them set, hee, and his men by Night: And smote them, and pursued them to Hoba in their flight. 26 And there recouered all the goods, and brought thence backe agayne: His Brother Lot, and People all, that then were left vnslayne. 27 When after hee returned had, from slaughter of the Kinge Rederlaomer, and the rest of Kinges, that hee did bringe: 28 There mette him in the Ualley playne, which Kynges Dale is to name, Kinge Bera, Kinge of Sodome Lande, and halste him in the same. 29 Melchisedech of Salem Kinge, came also forth in fine, Him to salute with Presente meete, and brought forth Breade, and Wine. 30 Hee was the Priest to God of Gods, in perfecte doctrine staid, And by the holy sprite of God, hee Abram blest, and sayd, 31 Blest bee thou Abram euermore, of God the Lorde on hye, Possessor both of Heauen and Earth, and all that liues thereby. 32 And blessed bee the God most high, the God of Sea, and Lande, Which hath thy Foes deliuered, by might into thy hande. 33 And then the Kinge of Sodome sayd to Abram in this wise, Geue me the Soules, and take the Goods: as please thee them deuise. 34 Abram to him thus aunswered, I haue lifte vp my hande To God, that owes both Heauen and Earth, before whose Face I stande. 35 I will not take of that is thine, whateuer that it bee, So much as is a little Threed, or Lachet shooe from thee: 36 Least thou perhaps, hereafter say, Abram is rich by mee, Saue onely that which eaten is by these Yongmen you see: 37 And eke the partes I do except of those with me that wente, Aner, Escoll, and Mamre eke, their partes shall them content. [Cap. 15.] The Contents of the XV. Chapter. The Lande agayne is promysed To Abram, and his seede, Abram beleeues, and therefore hee Is Iustified in deede. The Prophecie of Bondage great To Isralites, that fell, Howe they vnder Kynge Pharao, Fowre hundred Yeares shoulde dwell, And howe they were deliuered, This same shall also tell. 1 And after when these thinges were done, and Abram wel apayde, The word of God, to Abr? came, in Uision thus, and sayde: 2 Bee of good cheare, &amp; not afraid, for I am thy defence: Exceedinge great is thy rewarde, ere thou departest hence. 3 Agayne to God then Abram sayde, Lorde what wilt thou mee geue, Sith I goe Childlesse vp and downe, the Dayes that I do liue? 4 The Childe of this thy Stewardship that's of my House to showe, Is hee the same Eleazer, was borne at Damasco. 5 O Lord my God behold and see, thou geuest mee no scede, And loe, this Ladde borne in my House, myne Heyre shalbe in deede. 6 The word of God yet once againe came vnto Abrams Eare: Which sayde, the Ladde borne in thy House hee shall not bee thine Heyre. 7 But of thy Body one shall come, thy Sonne, and Heyre shalbe, And then God brought him out and sayd, looke vp to Heauen and see. 8 And tell the starres therein that bee, if thou them number can: Euen so thy Seede, on Earth shalbee, surpassinge reach of man. 9 And what the Lorde to Abram sayde, of Abram was beleeu'de. Which reckned was such righteousnes, as might not bee remeu'de. 10 To him agayne the Lord yet sayde, I am, that brought thee free From Vr, out of the Chaldee Lande, to geue this Lande to thee. 11 O Lord my God, sayde Abram then, whereby shall I this knowe, That I this Lande shal so possesse as thou hast sayde, or no? 12 God bade him take an Heifer yonge, of three yeares olde to bee. A Female Goate, a Ramme likewise, whose Ages shoulde agree. 13 A Turtledoue, a Pigeon yonge God also had him take: And Abram knewe after what sorte hee should diuision make 14 All these hee tooke, and in the midd'st deuided them in twaine, And then one peece, gaynst other set in order so agayne. 15 But yet the Foules hee sundred not, ne woulde them so display: As Birdes vppon their Carkasse fell, hee draue them still awaye. 16 And when the Sunne declined was, and Darcknes did appeare: On Abram fel a slumbring sleepe, and eke a sodayne feare: 17 And in the same God sayd to him. let this be knowne to thee, Thy seede shall dwell in forrayne Lande, and as a Straunger bee. 18 And Seruauntes theirs shall they become, and do what they them will: And for their paynes foure hundred Yeares, shall they reward them ill. 19 This Nation yet whom they shall serue shall Iudged be of mee. And after shall thy seede departe with richesse, and be free. 20 And thou in peace shalt passe away, whereas thy Fathers lye, And in an Olde and goodly age, shalt buried lye them by. 21 And in the fourth Age after this, they shall agayne come heere. For why, the sinne of th' Amorites more fuller shall appeere. 22 And after so it came to passe, when downe the Sunne did goe: Aboue vnder the Firmament, a darky Cloude did showe, 23 A smokinge Furnace, and a Brande of glowinge Fyer seene: Which went the peeces as they laye, oft to and fro betweene. 24 And in the Daye, when this was seene, God did a Cou'naunt make With Abram saying: to thy Seede, this Lande haue I betake. 25 From Egipt, vnto Euphrates, by Riuers as they flowe, The Kenits, and the Kenizites, and Kadmonites also: 26 The Hethites, and the Pheresites, and Giantes fierce and fell: The Amorites, and Cananites, with Kinreddes where they dwell: 27 The Gergesites, and Iebusites, with all that these possesse: Unto thy Seede haue I this geuen. by Cou'naunt, I confesse. [Cap. 16.] The Contents of the XVI. Chapter. To Abram, Sarai geueth leaue, to take her Mayde to wyfe: The Mayde her Maistresse doth displease, by which there grewe much strife: And Sarai doth intreate her ill, the Mayde doth runne away: The Aungell meetinge wyth the Mayde, commaundeth her to staye, And to her Maistresse to returne: sayinge all shall bee well: And that the Childe shee went wythall, shoulde calde bee Ismaell. 1 And Sarai, Abrams Wife that was, bare him no Childe as yet, And hauinge in her House a Mayde, shee thought her for him fit: 2 And therefore vnto Abram sayd, the Lorde doth me restrayne, So that I can no Children beare, but barreyn still remayne. 3 I pray thee goe in to my Mayde, that Hagar is by name: By her perhaps, I may receiue some comforte by the same. 4 And Abram did obey the Uoyce and Wordes that Sarai sayd: And Sarai, Abrams Wyfe then tooke Hagar, th' Egiptian Mayde, 5 And to her Husband did her geue to bee his Wyfe, and feere: Hee Hagar knewe, and shee conceiu'de, as after did appeere. 6 When Hagar sawe her selfe with Childe, shee gan then to despise Her Maistresse: and what ere shee did was hatefull in her Eyes. 7 Then Sarai vnto Abram sayd, good faith thou dost mee Wronge: My Mayde I haue geeuen vnto thee. the tyme is yet not longe: 8 And now that shee conceyued is, as shee the same doth see, I hated am, in sight of her, God iudge tweene thee and mee. 9 But Abram vnto Sarai saide, thy Mayde is in thy hande, Do thou with her as pleaseth thee, I will thee not withstande. 10 And when that Sarai angry was, shee vsed her not well: Then Hagar fledde from Sarais Face, with her shee would not dwell: 11 Into the Wildernesse shee fledde, where as shee did abide, And there the Aungell of the Lorde this heauie Hagar spied, 12 Hard by a Fountayne Water cleare, and thus to her did say, Whence cam'ste thou Hagar, Sarais Maide, and whither mak'ste thou way? 13 I flee (sayd shee) from froward Face of Sarai Maistresse myne, Who cruelly hath delt with mee, and at me doth repine. 14 Returne againe, sayd th' Aungell then, thy Maistresse home vnto: Submit thy selfe vnder her hand, and what she bids thee, doe. 15 And in encreasinge (sayd he than) I wil encrease thy Seede In number, such for multitude, as number shall exceede. 16 And more the Aungell sayd to her: thou arte with Childe I see: A Sonne it is, and Ismaell his proper name shalbe. 17 Comfort thy selfe in this distresse, thou shalt receiue reliefe: For why the Lord, thy voyce hath heard thy trouble, and thy griefe. 18 The Child that now is in thy Womb, a wilde Yongeman wilbe, And euery other man against lift vp his hande will hee: 19 Likewise, the hand of euery Man, against him shall arise. And in the presence shall hee dwell, of all his Brethrens Eyes. 20 Shee called then the Name of him, that thus vnto her spake: Thou God, thou God, dost looke on mee, for thy great Mercy sake. 21 For why, saith shee, haue I not seene, euen here amid this place? The hinder partes of this my God, that sees mee in the Face? 22 Wherefore the Well, that was her by, where th' Aungell did her see Was after cal'de the Well of him, that liues and seeth mee. 23 To Abram, Hagar bare a Sonne, that's Ismaell, by name: Fower score, and sixe, was Abrams Age: when Hagar bare the same. [Cap. 17.] The Contentes of the XVII. Chapter. The name of Abram, and his VVyfe, here chaunged shall you see. The Canaan Lande is promised, the fourth tyme, his to be. Howe Circumcision first beganne, this Chapter shall you tell: To Abram, Isacke promisde is who prays for Ismaell. 1 When Ninty Yeares of Abrams age and Nine, were run and gone: So that hee was to count vpon, an Hundreth Yeares saue one. 2 The Lord to Abram did appeere, and thus to him did saye, I am the Lorde th' Almighty God, before mee walke the waye: And bee thou perfecte in thy course: for I will make this Day, 3 My blessed Bond, twene me and thee, and will thee multiply: So that thy Seede the Earth shal fill, and that exceedingly. 4 And Abram fell vpon his face, wyth meeke and lowly cheere. And God stil talked yet wyth him, and sayd as doth appeere. 5 Abram, behold I am with the, my testament also: And thou a Father shalt be made, of Nacions great to growe. 6 And neuer shal fromhence thy name be Abram any more: But Abraham thy name shalbe, make glad thy selfe therfore: 7 For I a father haue the made of nations many a one. And I wil make the grow so great, as yet was neuer none. 8 So many shal the nations be, that I of the wil make: Yea Kinges shal come and springe of the, this wil I for thy sake. 9 My Bonde moreouer will I make, betwene my selfe and thee, And eke thy side in kinred theyrs, that after thee shalbe. 10 And by an euerlasting wyll. this Bond haue I decreed. That I a God to the may be, and after thee, thy Seede. 11 And I wil geue to the and thine, that after the shal growe, The Land wherein a stranger thou yet to and fro dost goe. 12 Euen al the Lande of Canaan. for euer shal they haue: And I will be to them their God, and heare them when they craue. 13 Therefore (sayd God) see that thou keepe, my testament wyth the. Both thou, and thine, shall the succeede, in kinreds as they be. 14 And this is now my testament, I wil you to be donne, Twene me and you, and twyxt thy seede that after thee shall come: 15 I will that you shall Circumcise, ech Manchilde, that is borne Amonge you, in your Kinreddes all, as I haue sayd beforne. 16 And you the Foreskin of your Flesh shal Circumcise also, Which of the Bonde a signe shalbe tweene mee and you, to knowe. 17 And euery Manchilde you amonge, that Eight Dayes olde shalbe, Likewise shall Circumcised bee, as I haue sayd to thee. 18 And such as in your Kinreddes are, and borne at home, in deede: And such as be with Mony boughte. of Straungers from thy seede, 19 I saye, the man borne in thy House, and hee with Money bought, Must needes all Circumcised bee, as I before haue taught. 20 And in your fleshe my Testament a Signe shalbe most sure Of this same Bond tweene mee and you, for euer to endure. The Man Childe eke, that's borne with you, that is not Circumcised, In order such, and at such time, as I haue you aduised, 22 That soule shall perishe from the rest, because he broken hath My Testament I made with thee, and turnde himselfe to skath. 23 And God sayd vnto Abraham, thou shalt not call thy Wife Sarai, but Sara is her name from hence forth all her life. 24 And I will blesse her, (sayth the Lord) and haue geuen thee a Sonne That shall proceede, and come of her, that neuer erst was done: 25 Upon her People eke likewise, I will such blessinges bringe, As out of her shal Nations great and kinges of people springe. 26 But Abraham fell on his face, and to hymselfe did smyle, And in the secrete of his harte, thus sayd within a while. 27 And shall a Childe be born to him, that's olde an hundreth yere? Shal Sara eke, th'ats Nynety yere, be able for to beare? O Lord that Ismaell myght liue, and in thy sight appeare. 28 To whom God sayd, Sara thy wife, shall beare a Sonne indeede: And Isahac thou shalt him call: a plante euen of thy seede. 29 And I will make my band wyth him, an euerlasting band, And wyth his future seede to come, that euermore shal stande. 30 Concernyng Ismaell thy Sonne, I haue the heard also, I haue him blest and will him make, for to Encrease and growe: And will hys seede much multiply, exceding great in showe. 31 For Princes twelue shal he beget, this will I for thy sake, And I of him and of his seede a Nacion great wil make. 32 My bond I'le make wyth Isahac, Whych Sara shal thee bryng: Just twelue monthe hence, at this same tyme, shall happen so the thynge. And god went vp from Abraham, and left to talke with him: 33 Then Abraham tooke Ismael his sonne which Hagar brought, And such as in his house were borne, or were for mony bought. 34 As many as men children were, among his houshold all, He Circumcised them eche one, as God did say, thou shal: 35 I say the fleshe of theyr foreskinne in lowe and humble wise, Upon the Day God poynted had, hee did them Circumcise. 36 And Abraham, himselfe also, an hundreth yeres saue one Was, when the fleshe of his foreskinne was cut away and gone. 37 And Ismael, was of the age of thyrtene yeres, to show, When as the foreskinne of his fleshe was Cyrcumcised so. 38 The selfe same Day, was Abraham and Ismael, his sonne, And al the menne borne in his house, that did together wonne, 39 And such as were for mony bought, that in his house did byde, I say they were wyth Abraham, together Circumcis'd.

Sayd they, go, do as thou hast sayde, we wil abide and staye. 8 Then Abraham departed thence, and so apace he wente Unto his wyfe that Sara was, abyding in the Tente. 9 He bad she should three peckes of meale the finest strength to take: The same wyth spede at once to knede, and Cakes therof to make. 10 And Abraham vnto the Beastes did runne a Calfe to fet, That young and tender was to see, fyt for the Fyer set. 11 He gaue the same a yong man to, that then was there with him, And he the same with hasty spede. did ready make and trim. 12 When Cakes were bak'te, and ech thing els in decent order was, He Butter tooke and Milke also, and brought the Calfe in place: 13 Where as they were vnder the Tree and it before them set, Then Abraham vnder the Tree, stode by when they did eate. 14 And Abraham demaunded was by them whom God had sent: Where Sara was? he answered, beholde, shee's in the Tent. 15 Sayd he, I wil in my returne come backe agayne to thee, Acordinge to the tyme of lyfe, that shall apparant be. 16 And loe: thy Wyfe shal haue Sonne such fauour shalt thou fynde: That Sara heard where as she stode, The Tent dore there behynde. 17 For Abraham and Sara both, in yeares were very olde, T'was not with hir as Women with, she baren was and colde. 18 Therfore she laughed where she stoode and to hir selfe did saye, Now am I oulde, my Lord also, shal I with lust go playe? 19 But God which heard and saw hir hart, did Abraham aske, why That Sara laught within herselfe and sayd thus secretely, 20 Shal I that Olde and barain am conceiue and a chyld beare? Is any thyng to wonderfull for God to do each where? 21 I saye, accordinge to the time that I apoynted thee: I hyther will returne agayne when time of Life shalbe: And Sara shall bringe forth a Sonne, and that thine Eyes shall see. 22 When Sara heard her thought disclos'd shee was as then afrayde: And sayd, forsooth I lawghed not: and so the same denayde. It is not so, but thou di'dst Lawghe, to her agayne he sayd. 33 And so these men stode vp and look'd, from thence to Sodom warde, And Abraham, parte of theyr waye did both them guide, and garde. 34 And as he went, the Lord thus sayd, shal I from Abram hide That thinge which now I minde to doe, where Sodomytes abyde? 35 I know that Abraham shalbe a people great to see, And all the Nacions of the Earthe in hym shall blessed be. 36 Also I knowe hee wyl commaunde his Children and his flocke And of his housholde after hym, that springeth of his stocke, 37 To keepe the way of God theyr Lord, and do the thing that's right, With conscience pure, that God may bringe on Abraham such light As God before hym promysed, by Richesse of his might. 38 The Cry of Sodom and Gomorre. God said, is very greate, And sure theyr Synne more greeuous is, then fiers flamyng heate. 39 I will therefore goe downe, sayd he, the same to viewe and see, Whether they haue in all so donne, as Cryeis come to me. 40 And so the men departed thence, and toward Sodome wente, But Abraham before the Lorde yet stode wyth good entent: 41 At last drew neare and said, wilt thou destroye the righteous all Wyth wycked menne, that therein be? perhap it may so fall, 42 Thou mayste amonge the wicked sorte there fifty righteous see, Wilt thou (O God) not spare the place for fifty right that be? 43 Let that be far and far from the, that thou the Iust should slaye Together wyth the wicked sorte that haue despysd thy way. 44 And that the righteous should appeere. as wycked in thy sighte: Shall not the Iudge of all the world, according do to right? 45 If I in Sodome City finde, fifty that righteous are, I will (sayd God) for fiftye sake, both men, and City spare. 46 And Abraham, thus answered, and sayd (O Lorde) beholde, I that but Ashes am and Duste, to speake yet am so holde. 47 It so may chaunce there shal lacke fiue, of fifty righteous men Wilt thou the City, and the reste destroy, for wante of them? 48 God sayd againe, if I may find but forty there and fiue, I wyl the City saue from harme, and all therein alyue. 49 Sayd Abraham, the Citty (Lorde) may Forty righteous make: God sayd, I will it not destroy for Forty righteous sake. 50 O let my Lorde, not angry bee, that I replye agayne: There may be Thirty found therein, that righteous do remayne. He sayd, if I but Thirty finde, I will do no man payne. 51 O see, sayd hee, I haue presum'de my God to speake to, here: There may be Twenty yet therein, that righteous may appeare: Sayd God, then for those Twenties sake, the City shalbe cleare. 52 O Lord with me not angry bee, but let thine anger ceasse: I will this once, but speake to thee, and after holde my peace: 53 Perchaunce, there yet may Tenne be there that do thee loue and serue: I will sayd God, for those Tenne sake. the City whole preserue. 54 Thus when that God of Abraham had heard what hee coulde say: Almighty God departed thence: and Abraham that Day Returned backe vnto hys place, within his Tent to staye. [Cap. 19.] The Contentes of the XIX. Chapter. Ivst Lot two Angels doth receyue, VVythin his House to byde, The Sodomites do compasse rounde, Lots House on euery side. From Sodoms Plague, Lot is set free, By power of mighty hande: Lots VVyfe into a Piller Salt VVas turnde, and so doth stand: How Lot wyth wyne was ouer chargde, And wyth his Daughters laye, And how they Chyldr? brought hym forth, By this perceyue you maye. 1 At Sodome Gate, as Lot there sat, the Day, and Night betwene: Two A?gels, vnto Sod?e c?e, whom when that Lot had seene: Hee rose, and ran them for to meete, and bowed downe hys Face, And so alonge, vppon the Ground, hee did th? both embrace, 3 And sayd, my Lordes turne in I pray, your Seruauntes house within, This Night abide, and washe your Feete: and or the Day begin 4 You shall rise earely in the Morne, and so departe againe: They yet denay'de, and sayd we will in streates al night remayne. 5 Ah las not so (my Lordes) sayd Lot: and Lot importune was: With humble speach did them compell, and so it came to passe, 6 In manner, as it were by force, they turned in at last, Into the House of this Iust Lot: and Lot with speedy haste: 7 Made them a Feast, &amp; bak't them bread of sweete and sauery Do: They eate thereof, were satisfied, and well contented so. 8 But ere these Men to rest had gon, the Sodomites came out, Both old, and yonge, and compassed the House of Lot about. 9 They called Lot, and thus wise sayde, tell vs where be those Men, Which came into thy house this Night? come forth, and bringe vs theym, That we with them our Lust may vse. Good Lot prepard him then: 10 And out of Dores to them he went, and sparrd the dore agayne, And sayde, alas good Brethren mine, let not such filthe remaine: 11 But for Gods sake I humbly aske, do not so wickedly Beholde I haue of Daughters twayne, Ile fetch them by and by: 12 They Maydens bee, and knowe no man, with them do what you please: Forbeare these men, and suffer them to rest, and take their ease. 13 To these men onely, nothinge doe, for therefore came they in Under the Shadowe of my Roofe, For feare of Sodome sinne. 14 Stande backe (to Lot sayd some of them,) againe sayd other some, Lot came as one to soierne here, is Lot a Iudge become? 15 Wee surely will deale worse with thee, then with these Men within: And so on Lot they pressed sore, to haue committed sinne. 16 And came the dore of Lot to breake: the Men put forth their hand, And pulled Lot into the house, to them where they did stand. 17 The Sodomites without the dore, were smote with Blindnesse all, So that the dore they coulde not finde, they faynted so withall: 18 The Men of God, to Lot thus sayd, if thou haue Sonnes in lawe, Or Sonnes, or Daughters of thine owne: them, from this Citty drawe: 19 Or what so euer else thou haste, this Citty here within, Bringe it from hence, for wee are sent the same to burne for sinne. 20 For why, the crie of them is great, before the Face of God: And now it shall destroyed bee, with his cosuminge Rodde. 21 Then Lot went out, and thus wise spake vnto his Sonnes in lawe: Which Maried had his Daughters deere: my Sonnes, now stande in awe 22 Of God the Lord, and get you hence, for God hath hyther sent His Aungels, this to overthrowe, the Citty shalbe brent. 23 The Sonnes in Lawe tooke all for Iest their Father Lot did say, And so as though hee seem'de to mocke, they let him goe his way. 24 But when the Morninge did arise, theese Aungels Lot did call: And caused him to haste away, for feare least hee might fal: 25 Stand vp (sayd they) and take thy Wife, and Daughters twaine thee by, Least that thou perishe in their Sinne, and in the Citty dye. 26 And as Lot did the tyme prolonge, the Men of God, (loe) caught Both Lot, his Wyfe, and Daughters twayne, and by the hande them braught, 27 And set them safe the Citty out, and thus to them did say: Nowe saue thy life, and looke not backe, ne tary in the way, 28 Of all this Plaine, and Champion Grounde, or Countrey thou arte in: But in the Mountayne, saue thy selfe from plague that's sent for Sinne. 29 Not so, my Lorde, sayd Lot to them thy Seruaunt in thy sight: Great grace hath founde and mercy both, by Goddes vndoubted mighte, 30 In that my lyfe preserued is, and from the cittie free, Thy mercy hast thou magnified, and shewed vnto mee. 31 Behold I cannot saued bee, in Mountaynes for to lye, Least some mishap do fall on mee: and therewithall I dye. 32 But (loe) my Lord here is at hand, A litle citty by Euen yonder little one you see, to which place I may flye. 33 O let mee there preserued bee, is not the Cittie small, And wilt not thou that Cittie spare and mee alyue wythall? 34 I haue (sayd God) concerning this, receiued thy request, And for thy sake I wyl it spare, thou shalt be there in rest. 35 Go hast thee hence, and there be safe for I can nothing doe, Tyl thou from hence art thyther gone, my wyll is bent there to 36 That little Cittie, therefore now is Zoar cald by name: The Sunne new rysen was on Earth when Lot came to the same. 37 But yet Lots wife for looking backe, which was to her forbod, Was turnde into a Pyller Salt, by mightie worke of God. 38 And when that Lot thus entred was, the cittie Zoar in, The Lorde from Heauen on Sodome sent and Gomer for their Synne 39 Great rayne of fyre, and Sulpher strong, not to bee quenched out, And ouerthrew those citties all, and Region round about. 40 Thus all that in those citties dwelt, consumed were with woe, And all that grew vpon their Ground was brent to Dust also. 41 And very earlye in the Morne aryse did Abraham, And got him to the place agayne where last from God he came. 42 And looking vnto Sodome ward?, Gomorra eke also, And toward all the Land about, and Countrye there in showe: 43 The smoke of all that Country rose, much lyke a Furnace great, And yet God thought on Abraham, in this consuming heate. 44 And vpon Lot God mindful was, when he his Angelles sent: And hym deliu'red from the myddes of Cittes when they brent. 45 And Lot from Zoar did depart, he feared there to dwell. And in the Mountaines chose a place, a hollow Caue or Cell, Where he and his two Daughters lefte, Contented were to Dwel. 46 And in those Dayes Lottes daughters sawe how eu'ry Man was slayne: And none but Lot theyr father left, alyue that did remayne. 47 The Elder to the Yonger sayd, good sister myne beholde: Ther's not a man left in the world, to know vs, as men should. 48 Come, we wil make our father dronke, and fil his head wyth Wyne, And lye wyth him and rayse him seede, the first Night shalbe myne. 49 And so that night they made him dronke, she wyth her father laye: But Lot, knew not when she lay downe, nor when she went her way. 50 And in the Morning so it hapt, the Elder Daughter sayd, Sister behold this Night that's past, no whit at all afrayd 51 I lay al Nyght my father wyth, let's make him dronke also Againe this nyght: and to his Bedde thy turne shalbee to goe: 52 That we to him some seede may raise, hereafter for to growe. That Night againe they gaue him wyne and did hym ouerthrowe. 53 And then the yonger Sister rose, and lay wyth him likewise: Lot, not perceyued when she came, nor when shee did arise. 54 These daughters twayne, their father knew, and were wyth Child begot, The father ouerchargde wyth Wyne, the thing remembred not. 55 Howbeit th' elder bare a Sonne, and Moab was his name, The Father of the Moabites, hee is this day the same. 56 The younger bare a Sonne also, whose name was Benammi, To Ammons broode hee father is vnto this day we trye. [Cap. 20.] The Contentes of the twentith Chapiter. How Abraham as straunger went, and did his wyfe denay, And how the king of Gerar land, tooke her from him away. 1 And Abraham now left the Playne of Mamre where hee dwelt, And went in Countrye of the South, where more Sunnes heate he felt, 2 So there betweene Cades &amp; Sur, a further truth to tell, In Gerar pitched hee his Tent, to soiourne there and dwell. 3 Abimelech was king thereof, and hee for Sarai sent, Because t'was sayd, a Woman fayre, abydeth in his Tent. 4 When Abraham demaunded was, what woman shee should bee, Shee is sayd hee none of my wyfe but Syster is to mee. 5 Abimelech had her away in purenesse of his Harte: And Abraham did seeme content, to let her so depart: 6 But God vnto Abimelech by Night, in Dreame thus spake: Beholde sayd hee thou now shalt die for this same Womans sake: 7 For shee is Wyfe vnto the Man that thou hast tane her fro: Abimelech yet toucht her not, nor no time did her knowe. O Lord, sayd he, and wilt thou slay the righteouse People foe? 8 Did they not both to mee affirme his Sister shee to bee? O Lord thou knowest with guiltlesse Heart this thinge is done of mee. 9 And God likewise by Dreame did say I knowe it very well, Thy Heart, and Handes were pure and cleane, as thou to mee dost tell: 10 I also thee preseru'de and kept, agaynst mee not to sinne, And therefore woulde not suffer thee, to knowe what shee had bin. 11 But see that thou deliuer nowe the Man, his Wyfe agayne. For hee is a Prophet, and shall praye that thou maist liue and raigne: 12 But if thou wilt not let her goe, and set her from thee free: Bea sure that thou shalt die the Death, and all thou hast with thee. 13 Abimelech betimes therfore that Morning did aryse: And all his seruauntes did commaund, t'appeare before his eyes: 14 And in their eares declared that which God to him had sayd: The hearing of the which in deede did make them sore afrayde. 15 Likewise for Abraham he cal'd and sayd what hast thou done? And what haue I offended thee? that thou hast thus begonne? 16 To bring on mee, and kingdome myne, so great a Synne as this, What didst thou see, in mee or these, to do so much amisse? 17 O King, sayd then this Abraham, of truth such was the cace. As I did thinke God was not knowne nor feared in this place. 18 And therfore hauing such a wyfe, as fayre is to the eye, Lest for her sake I perish should, and so too tymely dye: 19 I sayd she was and so shee is my Sister as you see By Father, but by mother not, and Wife became to mee. 20 And after from my Fathers house, when God did byd mee goe: Then to my wife in sort I sayd, this kyndenesse do me showe, 21 In places where wee wander in if any aske and saye Is this thy Husband, yea or no, thou shalt the same denay, 22 And mee confesse a Brother thyne, whome Nature doth compell, To wander thus about wyth mee, in Countries, where to dwell. 23 Abimelech the kinge then tooke of Sheepe, and Oxen store, Of men seruauntes and Women too, and brought them him before. 24 And gaue them vnto Abraham, for euer to remayne, And with the same deliuered Sara his wyfe agayne. 25 And sayd, behold before thy face, my Land doth open lye. Choose where thou wilt therein to dwell, as best shall please thyne eye. 26 But vnto Sarah sayd the king Sara behold and see: I haue thy Brother Siluer geeuen, a thousand pieces free. 27 And hee the Ueyle is of thyne eyes, to all that are with thee, And al men els and therewithall, reproued so was shee. 28 So Abraham to God did praye, and God his voyce did heare: The King made whole: his Wyfe, and Maydes, did Children after beare. 29 For God thus plagued had the house of Bimelech the King, The Matrix of them all were stopt, they might no issue bring. Till Abraham his Wyfe receiu'd, thus happened the thinge. [Cap. 21.] The Contents of the XXI. Chapter. How Isaac, that promisde was, is heere of Sara borne. How Hagar wyth yonge Ismaell, in Banishment doth morne. And how the Angell of the Lorde vnto poore Hagar cam, And of the Cou'naunt made betweene the Kynge, and Abraham. 1 As God before had promised, as hee to Sodome went, Sarah to see in his returne: so ere the time were spent, 2 Shee knewe her selfe to bee with child, and bare a goodly Sonne, Accordinge to th' appoincted time, that God did say, was done. Thus in his olde Age Abraham, a Father was become. 3 And Abraham did call the name of him that Sara bare Isack: and then this Abraham with diligence and care, 4 Dyd Circumcise his little Sonne when hee was eight Dayes olde, As God before commaunded had in order howe hee shoulde. 5 An hundreth yeares was hee of age when Isaac was borne: But Sara sayd, nowe God hath made mee to bee laught to scorne: 6 Who would haue sayd to Abraham, that Sara sucke should geue? For in his Age, I haue him borne a Sonne: Longe may hee liue. 7 The Childe did growe, and Weyned was, and then as was the guise, Uppon that Day, hee made a Feast in very solemne wise. 8 Then Sara sawe, how Hagars Sonne that was th' Egiptian Mayde, Became a scornefull mockinge Ladde: to Abraham shee sayd. 9 This Bondmayde see thou put away, and eke her Sonne also: Hee shall not ioyne with Isaac my Sonne, as Heyre I troe. 10 This sayinge greeued Abraham, and nipt him at the heart: Because from Ismaell his Sonne hee loth was to depart. 11 But God thus spake to Abraham, greue not hereat at all. For Ismaell, nor Bondmayde thine. for Isaac Ile call. 12 Heare Saras voyce, and do therein as shee hath sayd to thee: For as I sayd, in Isaac thy Seede shall called bee. 13 Also the Sonne of thy Bondmayde. because hee's of thy Seede: I promise the, I wil hym make A Nacion great in deede, 14 So Abraham rose earely vp, and did him ready make, And eke prepar'de for Ismael and this pore Hagars sake, 15 Breade, and wyth water Bottel filde and to her gaue it there, Setting the same her shoulders on, and Lad also to beare. 16 And thus away was Hagar sent who wandred vp and downe In wildernes of Berseba, far of from Cote or Towne. 17 In time she had the water spente, that in the Bottell was Her Sonne through want was like to dye, a woful mothers case. 18 She cast the Lad under a Bushe, and went on th' other side, And sat her downe, a Boweshot of, sayinge, whatere betide, 19 I will not see the death of him, and therewith all shee wepte, And wronge her handes with greuous grones, continuall mone shee kept. 20 But God did heare the cryinge voyce of this her Lad or Childe, And out of Heauen Gods Angell spake with woordes to Hagar milde. 21 What ayleth thee, bee not afraide, stand vp therefore, and rise. For God hath heard thy only Sonne, where as hee lies, and cries. 22 Arise therefore, the Lad lift vp, and take him by the hand: I will of him a People make, and mighty for to stande: 23 And God her Eyes did open so, as shee a Well did see: With water did her Bottel fyll. and therewythal dyd shee Giue Drynke vnto her Louing Chylde, that erste nye deade was hee. 24 And so, God styll was wyth the Lad, In Wyldernes be dwelt, He grewe apace, an Archer was, and Bowe and Arrowes felt. 25 And when he grew an hable man, and for a woman fitte, His Mother out of Egipt Land, a wyfe there did him git. 26 And at that tyme it chaunced so Abimelech the kynge And Phicoll, his chyefe Captayne spake to Abraham, saying. 37 God is wyth thee, in al thou doest, and therfore sweare to me. Euen by the name of lyuing God, Which hath donne much for thee, 28 That thou wilt do to mee no hurte, nor to my Chyldren deare: Nor yet to Chylders Chyldren myne, I say thus shalt thou sweare, 29 To deale with mee and Country myne, Where thou a straunger wast, As I haue shew'ne my selfe to thee in kindnesse that is past: I will so sweare, sayd Abraham, and tooke such Oth at last. 30 Ere this the Seruauntes of the Kinge by force had tane away A Well, that Abraham had Digg'de, and therefore did hee say, 31 With some rebuke vnto the Kinge, thy Seruauntes beinge stronge, Haue tane away by violence my Well, and donne mee wronge. 32 The Kinge thus sayd, I knowe not who hath done this thinge to thee: Also agayne vnto this Daye thou neuer tolde it mee, Yet neither heard I of the same, it shall amended bee. 33 And Abraham gaue to the Kinge of Sheepe, and Oxen faire, And both of them together made a Bond of Frendship there. 34 And seuen Ewe Lambes did Abraham alone together set: What meane these Lambes, then sayde the Kinge alone that's hyther set? 35 These seuen Ewe Lambes, sayd Abraham, thou shalt take at my hand, That they may witnesse vnto mee, the Well, to vnderstande 36 Was Digde by mee: and to this Daye thus Called is the place Berseba, for because that there they Sworne together was. 37 And then the Kinge and Phicol both rose vp and turnde agayne Unto the Lande of Philistims whereof he King did raygne. 38 And Abraham did plant a Groue, wherein he digde a Wel, That he therein the name of God (th' almighty Lord to tel) 39 Continually did cald vpon with perfect fayth and stronge, And in the land of Philistims remained very longe.

Abraham came for to mourn and wepe for Saras death, And stode vp from the sight of hyr to talke with sonnes of Heth 3 And sayde, behold a Stranger I &amp; forreyner yee see, Desyre some grounde to bury in, I pray you, geue it me, 4 That I may bury thys my Corse out of my sight to day: The children then of Heth agayne, this wyse to him gan say: 5 Behold my Lorde thou art a Prince of God among vs all, In chefest of our Sepulchres thy dead thou bury shall. 6 For none of vs shal thee forbidde the Sepulchres we haue, But therein mayst thou lay thy dead, as thou thyselfe dost craue. 7 Then Abraham stode vp and gaue obeysance for the same Before the people of the land, th' ofspringe of Heth by name. 8 And further sayd he vnto them, if it your pleasure bee, I bury shall my deade from syght, then harken vnto mee. 9 Ephron the sonne of Zoar hath a double Caue you knowe Which in the ende of all his Fielde appeareth there in showe, 10 I you besech to speake for me, that I the same may haue, For so much money as it's worth, no other do I craue: 11 And in the presence of you al I will the Money paye For a possession vnto me wherin I bury may. 12 Ephron the Hethit answered to Abrahams request In hearyng of the Children all of Heth and of the rest 13 That went in at the Citty Gates: not so my lord (heare me) The Field and Caue that is therein I freely geue it thee. 14 And this I speake in presence here of Sonnes and people myne, Igeue it thee: interre thy dead, for euer it is thyne. 15 And Abraham his body bowd as then such was the guyse, Before the people in the land, and aunswerd in this wise. 16 I pray thee harken vnto mee if it thee not offend: I wyl geeue Syluer for the field, and count thee so my freend: Take it and I wyl burye there my dead and so an ende. 17 Ephron agayne to Abraham, in this sort did replye: Four hundred sikles is the Lande of Syluer worth to buye. 18 Alas my Lord and what is that, twixt Abraham and mee? Enterre therfore thy dead therein, and take it vnto thee. 19 And Abraham gaue eare to him, and did the siluer pay, (In hearinge of the Sonnes of Heth) asmuch as he did say: 20 Four hundreth siluer Sikles t'was of currant monye told, Such as the Marchauntes vse to take for Wares when they haue sold: 21 For Ephrons Fyeld with double Caue, before Mamre that lay, With trees therein and borders round, did Abraham then paye. 22 So was it made to Abraham, possession good and sure, In sight of Hethite Children there, for euer to endure. 23 Also in presence of theym all that to the Cittie went, This thing was done and witnessed, the Parties were content. 24 And after this did Abraham interre within this Caue Sara his wyfe with auncient Rytes, as Corses vse to haue. 25 This Field, and Caue and Trees therein, Mamre before doth lye Which Hebron is, and in the Land of Canaan to trye. 26 So both the Field, the Caue, and all was by the Sonnes of Heth, Thus wyse made sure to Abraham, for buriall after death. [Cap. 24.] The Contents of the XXIIII. Chapter. How Abraham his Seruaunte makes to sweare ere thing be done, And sendes him foorth a wyfe to seeke for Isaac his sonne. He sought, and brought Rebecca home, as God appointed had, VVhom Isaac tooke vnto wyfe, whereof they all were glad. 1 And Abraham was verye olde, wel stept in yeares and dayes, And in all thinges had God him blest by diuers sundrye wayes. 2 He sayd his eldest seruant to, which chiefest rule did beare, Come, put thy hand vnder my Thighe for I wyl make thee sweare 3 Euen vnto God of Heauen and Earth, before whose face I stand, That thou perfourme this solemne Oth by putting to thy hand: 4 That is thou shalt not take a wyfe, to Isaac my Sonne, Of daughters of the Cananites among the which I wonne. 5 But shalt vnto my natiue soyle among my kynred goe, And there a wyfe thou shalt prepare for Isaac to know. 6 But Sir, sayd hee, what if that shee wyl not agree thereto, And come with mee into this Land, Shall I this thing then doe? 7 As bring thy Sonne into the Land out which thou camest fro? Beware of that, sayd Abraham, by Oth I charge thee no. That thou not thyther bring my Sonne where now thy selfe doest goe. 8 For why the God of Heauen which from my fathers house mee tooke, And from the Land where I was borne and that which vndertooke 9 T'appeare to me, and sweare to me, and sayd, vnto thy Seede Wyll I this Land to them and theirs, for euer geeue in deede, 10 I say that God shal send with thee his Angel now from hence, That thou maist choose and take a wyfe vnto my sonne from thence. 11 But if the woman do refuse, and for to come seeme loth, Then let her rest, and thou art free from daunger of this Oth. 12 But yet this thing aboue the rest, I charge thee vpon payne, That thou my sweete Sonne Isahack, not thyther bring agayne. 13 And so the Seruaunt put his hand, vnder his maysters Thye, 14 And sware to him concerning this, himselfe faythful to trye. And tooke with him of Camels ten, of other Goodes great store, The choise and best of al that were his Maysters goodes before. 15 Unto Mesopotamia by traueil great hee got, Unto the Cittie of Nahor, that Uncle was to Lot. 16 And there without the Citty gate, a Well he did espie, He made his Camels on the ground, along thereby to lye: 17 It was in th' Euening when he came at setting of the Sunne, Such tyme as Women to the Well for water thyther come. 18 The seruaunt then of Abraham, hard by the Wel him staid: And lifting vy his eyes to Heauen, to God in Hart thus prayd: 19 Thou mightie God of Maister mine, from whom I hyther came, This Day me speede and Mercy showe, vpon thyne Abraham. 20 For (loe) I stand the Well hard by where Maides wyl Water fet, And Daughters of the City here, there Pitchers downe wil set. 21 The Damsell now to whom I say, bowe downe thy Pitcher here, And let me drinke some of the Springe, and Water that is cleere. 22 Yf shee say, Drynke, and I wyl geue thy Camelles Drinke also: The same is shee thou hast ordaynde, For Isaac to know. 23 And thereby shall I vnderstand thy mercy great in showe, Upon my maister Abraham, thou largely doste bestowe. 24 And ere he had thus made an ende, behold it came to passe. Rebecca oute for Water came, that Bethuelles Daughter was 25 Sonne vnto Melcha Nahors wyfe, brother to Abraham. Her Pytcher on her shoulder set, thus to the Well she came, 26 Exceding fayre the Damsel was, to see or looke vpon, A Mayd also and free from man, for knowne she was of none. 27 Then downe she went vnto the Well, and did her Pitcher fill, Came vp agayne, and homeward went, shee thought not to stand still. 28 The Seruaunt then vnto her ranne, and thus to her did say: Of this thy Pitcher let me suppe some water I the pray. 29 Drynke sir, she sayd, and therewythall a while so did shee staye, And hasted downe vppon her Arme, her Pitcher for to laye: 30 And gaue him drinke, and after sayd, I will before I goe More Water drawe, that Camelles thine may drinke enough also. 31 Into a Trough that stoode thereby her Pitcher emptied shee: And Ran agayne vnto the Well, with speede such as might be, 32 And Water drewe for Camels al, and to the trough it brought, The fellowe (sure) great wonder had at her within his thought. 33 But held his peace, and silent was, to wit, where God or no Had made his Iourney prosperous, that hee about did goe. 34 And as the Camels left to drinke, hee tooke an Eareringe forth Of halfe a Sykle weight in Golde the value somewhat worth. 35 Two Golden Bracelettes for her handes, of Sikles tenne in weight. All these vnto the Mayde he gaue, and shee receiu'de them streight. 36 Whose Daughter then (sayd hee) art thou? I pray thee do mee tell: And is there roume for vs to Lodge in House where you do dwell? 37 I am (sayd shee) the Childe begot of Bethuell by name: And hee the Sonne of Nahor was, and Milcha bare the same. 38 Hee hearinge this, the Eareringe tooke and put it on her Face, And eke the Goulden Bracelettes both about her armes did brace: 39 His body bow'de, and worshipped the God of Heauen, and sayde: God of my Maister Abraham be blessed for this Mayde: 40 For thou with Mercy, and with Truth hast delt with Maister myne, That I vnto his Brothers House am brought by Mercy thine. 41 The Damsell to her Mothers house apace did homeward runne, And told to al that were therein eche thinge both sayd and donne. 42 And Laban that her Brother was so sone as he had seene The Eareringes, and the Bracelettes on hir armes, the same betwene 43 (And heard the wordes his sister spake) thus sayd the man to she, He then ranne out vnto the man, And by the Wel stode he, 44 And all his Camelles heard him by the Wel side round about Come in, saide Laban, blest of God wherfore stand'st thou without? 45 I haue the house prepard and drest, and roume enough for these Thy Camelles all prouided haue, wherein to take their ease: 46 And then the man into the house came in with gladsome thought: Hys Camels there vnbridle did, and Laban, Litter brought 47 And Prouender for Camelles his, and Water sweete and trimme To washe his Feete, and Feete of those that thither came with him: 48 And set before him, and the men, of good, and holsome Meate: Quoth he, I will my errande say, before that I do eate. 49 Say on my frende, sayd Bethuell the Father of the Mayde: What ere it bee, thou welcome art: therefore bee not afraide. 50 I am (sayd hee) to Abraham a seruaunt as you see: And God hath blest my Maister so with Richesse great that bee: 51 That Measure may not measure them, hee is become so great, God hath him geeuen, of Siluer, Gold, of Oxen, Sheepe, and Neate, 52 Of Men Seruauntes, and Maydens, and of Camelles, in such sort: And Asses eke, the Herdes whereof I can them not reporte. 53 Sara my Maisters Wyfe that was when shee was very olde, Bare him a Sonne, a goodly youth, of corage stoute and bolde. 54 On whom my mayster hath bestowde his goodes and Cattel al His Syluer, Gold, and other thinges likewyse possesse hee shal. 55 My Mayster now is growne in Yeares and therfore made me sweare Because I chiefe am in his House, and all the rule do beare: 56 Thou shalt not take for Isaac a wyfe: marke what I tell Of Daughters of the Cananites, here in whose Land I dwel: 57 But thou vnto my Fathers House and Kynred shalt repare: And take a Wyfe vnto my Sonne where myne owne Kynfolks are. 58 Sayd I vnto my Mayster tho, what if it happen so The Wyfe that I would haue for him, refuse wyth me to goe? 59 Sayd he, the Lord before whose face I stand and walke in sight, Wil send his Angel in the Waye and guyde thy course aright: 60 And prosper shal thy iourney so as thou a Wyfe shalt haue For my sweet Sonne, of Kinred myne, according as I craue. 61 So when thou com'st my Kinred to, from curse then art thou free: If they denye a Wyfe to gyue eke Gyltlesse shalt thou be. 62 And so this day vnto the Wel I came, and there I stayde, And in my hart, O Mighty God of Abraham, I sayd, 63 If it be so, this Iourney myne thou prosperous wilt make: Behold I stand the Wel hard by: where Maydes wil Water take, 64 And when a Uirgin shal forth come, and draw of Water clere And then I say, Damsel I pray, geue me of Water here, 65 Out of thy Pitcher for to drynke: and she then say to me, Drynke thou, and I wil also draw For Camels these with thee. 66 That same is she, that shalbe Wyfe vnto my maysters Sonne, And whom thou God appoynted hast before this thing begonne. 97 And yet ere I an end had made of speaking in myne Hart: Behold Rebecca then came forth of Water to haue part, 68 And on her Shoulder as she came a Pitcher did she beare, So went she downe into the Well and drawed water there. 69 Sayd I, I pray thee, geue me Drinke thou honest gentle mayd: With hast she toke hyr Pitcher downe and bade me Drinke: and sayde, 70 When thou hast Dronke, I wil goe downe and Water draw also And giue thy Camels for to drinke before that I do goe. 71 I dranke, and she more Water drew, and to my Camels brought Then for to know whose child she was I gently her besought. 72 My Fathers name is Bethuell and Nahors Sonne: sayd shee, Whom Milcha brought forth vnto hym, and Grandsire is to me. 73 I put the Earinge on hir face and Bracelets on her hand My selfe did bow and worship God, in place where I did stand: 74 And blessed God of Abraham, which had me thither brought, To take my maisters Brothers child vnto his Sonne vnsought. 75 Now also if that thou wil deale truly with Maister myne, And that his Sonne may haue to Wyfe Rebecca Daughter thyne, 76 Tel me: if not, that I may tourne the left Hand for to goe: Or if I shall: the right hand take: my Maister this to show. 77 Sayd Laban then and Bethuel, this saying doth proceede. Euen from the Lord of Heauen and Earth, by whom it was decreed 78 We therfore can of good ne bad say any thynge to thee: But as it pleaseth God to do, his wil fulfilled bee. 80 Beholde Rebecca is in sight, take her and goe thy way: That she may Wyfe be vnto hym as God hath sayd this day. 81 And when the Seruaunt heard these wordes he flat fel on the ground, And worshipt God from whom al grace and Mercy doth abounde. 82 And in a while the Seruaunt rose and from his Cariage fet Rych Iewels Coucht in Siluer fine, in Gold eke likewyse set: 83 And to Rebecca did them geue with Raiment rich in show, To Laban and to mother hers, ryche gyftes he gaue also. 84 So sat they downe to Eate and Drinke, both he, and they lykewyse With him that came: the Nyght ore past in Morning did aryse 85 And when the seruaunt ready was: let me depart (sayd hee) Unto my Maister Abraham that loketh longe for me. 86 Her Mother and her Brother deare vnto the Man thus spake: I praye thee, let the Damsel byde a whyle and mery make, 87 And if it be, but Ten Dayes space: with thee then shal she goe: Sayd he, I pray thee hynder not me in my Iorney foe: 88 Behold the Lord hath prosperd wel my Iourney in ech thing, Send me away to Maister myne, this happy newes to bring. 89 We wil (sayd they) the Damsel call and at hir Mouth enquire, Whether or no to goe or byde she rather doth desire. 90 And they Rebecca called foorth and said, wilt thou or no Goe wyth this Man? I wil (sayd she) and ready am to goe. 91 So then they let Rebecca passe, her nurse, and Abrams man. And eke those Men that then were there and with him thyther cam. 92 And then Rebecca blessed they, and thus to her dyd say, Now into thousand thousands growe, and God thee guyd alway. And that thy Seede the Enmies gates, possesse for euer maye. 93 This done, forthwith Rebecca rose her Damselles eke also, Upon the Camells were they set, and wyth this man did goe. 94 And so the Seruaunt toke the charge Rebecca safe to cary, They toke theyr leaue, away they went, and would no lenger tary. 95 Now from the way of Hagars Well, God lyues and seeth me, Came Isaac: for in the South that tyme there dwelled he. 96 And in the Euening as he went into the fieldes to pray. His Eies lift vp the Camels saw there comming in the way. 97 Rebecca lifted vp her Eyes when Isaac she spyde She lighted doune her Camel free, and so a whyle did bide. 98 And then vnto the seruaunt said, do you this same man know, That in the field approcheth vs? say therto, yea or noe? 99 It is my Maister, then sayd he, I put you out of doubt: She quickly then her Mantle tooke, and wrapt herselfe aboute: 100 To Isaack there told he all what hapned as he went: Then Isaac this Maiden brought into his mothers Tent. 101 He toke, Rebecca loued her, and she became his Wife. And comfort so receiued he, after his Mothers lyfe.

The Birth of Iacob and Esau Here vnderstand you may: How Esau for a messe of Rize His Birthright solde awaye. 1 And after this, did Abraham Keturah take to Wyfe: By whom he many Children got before he left this lyfe. 2 And ere eight score and fiftene Yeeres of Abraham were runne, Sore sicke hee fel and gaue his Goodes to Isaac his Sonne. 3 But to those Sonnes that hee begat by Lemmans his that fell, He gaue them Gyftes, sent them farre of from Isaac to dwell. 4 Thus in a goodlye lustie age when hee ynough had lyu'de, Death him approacht, and in due time of Lyfe hee him depriu'de. 5 Then Isaac and Ismael, when death his lyfe had caught, Their Fathers Bodie decentlye, into the Caue it brought. 6 Which Caue doth stand within the Field of Ephron Zoars Sonne, Which Abraham before had bought, and with his monye wonne. 7 Within this Caue was Abraham, and Sara eke like wise Entoumbde, with Rites and Obsequies, as such was then the guyse. 8 And after this, it pleased God this Isaac to blesse, That hee a mightie people grew with infinite increase. 9 Hee did inhabite by the Well that named was to bee, The VVel of him that euer liues and euer seeth mee. 10 These are the Generations of Ismaell to showe. Which Hagar bare to Abraham, his Mayde that was you know. 11 And by their Townes, and Castels eke these twelue did take their name, And of their Housholdes Princes twelue did spring out from the same. 12 The yeares of lyfe that Ismael vpon the Earth did beare Were Iust one hundreth to accompt and seuen and thirty yeare. 13 Then fel he sicke, his time was come, no longer might he byde: And after Death then was he layd his people them beside. 14 These are the Generations of Isaac to name, Who Sonne was vnto Abraham, for he begat the same. 15 Yeeres Forty old was Isaack when he to Wyfe did take Rebecca, who for hym alone her Parentes did forsake. 16 Shee Daughter was to Bethuel, the Aramite, you know: And Labans Sister th' Aramite this Bethuelles Sonne also. 17 And Isaac wel knowing that his Wife now barreyn was Made humble prayer vnto God and so it came to passe: 18 That God of hym intreated was, and she conceiued Life, And both the Babes together stroue in Bodye of his wife. 19 Said shee therfore, if it bee so what helpeth it at all With Childe to bee, when in my wombe such strife doth them befall? 20 And therfore vnto God she went to be resolu'de of this, To whom God sayd: bee thou content nothing is there amisse. 21 But in thy wombe two people are which shall from thee proceede And Nacions twayne sure shal they bee, vpon the Earth in deede. 22 The younger shal farre mightier be, much more then shal the other: Also the elder shal become a Seruaunt to his Brother. 23 And when her trauayling time was come, deliuered for to bee, Behold two Twynnes forth from her Wombe into the World brought she. 24 And he that first proceded forth was Red and rough about: And Esau they his name did cal and after him came out 25 His Brother holding Esau hard with hand vppon his Heele, And Iacob called they his name that Brothers Foote did feele. 26 These Children grew, and Esau then a Hunter good became Also the Earth did Till and Plow and play the Husbandman. 27 But Iacob was a perfect man and in the Tentes did dwell: But Isaac, Esau his Sonne did loue exceding wel. 28 Because he Venson often caught, which he thereof did Eate, But yet Rebecca Iacob lou'de and wel did hym encreate. 29 It so befell that Iacob this of Rice that's red did take: And did therewith as well he could, a messe of Potage make. 30 And as from hunting Esau came and fainty was withall, Upon the name of Iacob then his brother did he call 31 And sayd, I pray the brother mine haue some remorse on me: And feede thou me with Potage there, that's made of Rise, I see. 32 For I am weake and feeble too and faynt as man may be, And therefore Edom was he cald as witnesseth Abdye. 33 Sayd Iacob then, sel me this Day the Birth right that is thyne, And I for that now wil the giue, a Messe of Potage myne. 34 Sayd Esau then, behold I am the Dore of Death hard by, What profit then can birthright this do mee, if that I dye? 35 Iacob hym sayd, then sweare to me, as thou hast sayd before, That I thy Birthright shal possesse, from henceforth euermore. 36 And Esau there his hand forth put vnder his Thighe, and sware, And sold his brother al his right, for which he did not care 37 Then Iacob gaue to Esau that, that did him best content, Of Breade, and Pottage made of Rice, and so away hee went.

So Isaac in Gerar dwelt, and did Gods hest fulfil. 8 And they of Gerar where he dwelt, beheld Rebecca wel, And saw how that in fauour she and beauty did excel. 9 And askte of hym whether or no she was his spoused wyfe Affrayd hee was: and her deny'de lest they would take his Lyfe, 10 Beecause of her and therefore sayd shee is my sister sure But not my Wyfe whom Nature moues wyth me thys to endure. 11 And it befel by trace of tyme after theyr long abode, The king from out his wyndow look't and cast his eies abrode. 12 By hap did see this Isaac Rebecca eke also Sportyng and playing louingly as they together goe. 13 The King forthwith this Isaac before his presence cald, The sodden hearing of the same somwhat his sprites appald. 14 Sir (,said the king) this woman sure thy wife I see must bee, Why sayd'st thou then, shee onely was but Sister vnto thee? 15 O (mighty king) sayd Isaac thus in my selfe I thought, Perhap the beauty of my wife mought bring my life to nought. 16 And so through her and for her sake my death I might haue sought. Wel sayd the king, one of the men thy wyfe so might haue caught. 17 And layne with her and so should th[illeg.] brought synne vppon vs all: Because thy Folly suffer would thy wyfe thus wise to fall. 18 The king then streightly gaue in charge, to people in the land, That none should touch this Man or Wife by way of forcing hand. For who so did, of presence Death the payne shoulde vnderstand 19 Thus Isaac in quiet dwelt and sowed seede in ground, And that same yere by trauell his an hondreth measures found, 20 And so from small to greatter grew for why, the Lord hym blest: A myghty man the same became, and greatter then the rest 21 For he a Myghty houshold held, had Shepe and Oxen store, His Neighbours the Philistians did enuy him therfore. 22 And for to shew theyr spight and Ire, such rage was in their brayne, They went and fylled all tbe Welles, and stopt with Earth agayne, The which his Fathers men before had digde with micle payne. 23 Yea in so much the kinge himselfe bad Isahac depart, And sayd, in Myght a great deale more then we our selfe thou art. 24 So Isahac obesaunt was vnto the kynges behest, And into Gerars Ualley went thinkinge to dwel in rest. 25 And there be digged vp agayne the welles of Water cleere, Which in the dayes of Abraham his father digged were. 26 And which after his fathers death Philistines thither went And stopped vp the same agayne, so froward were they bent. 27 And loke what names his father gaue vnto these Welles before, So did he name and call the same to be for euermore. 28 The Seruantes of this Isaac did digge and breake the grounde In Ualley low and there a UUell of liuing Water founde. 29 And then the Herdemen of the Soyle that Gerar hath to name, Did stryue with Isacks Herd men there for Water of the same: 30 And said, the Water's none of yours, but ours, the truth to tell Then he did Esek call the Well, vpon the stryfe that fel, 31 And then another Well they digde for which they stroue also, And Sitnah they the same did call a name therby to knowe: 32 And then from thence departed be and digde another Wel, For which they stroue no whit at al, in quiet did they dwell. 33 Therfore Rehoboth was it cald. for why the Lorde, sayth he Hath made vs roume that we may growe whyle on the Earth wee be. 34 And vp from thence to Bersaba he went and that same nyght The Lord appeard, and sayd to him I am the God of Myght. 35 I say the god of Abraham that seruaunt was to me, And Father thyne: feare not therfore, For I am now with thee. 36 And will thee blesse and multiplye thy seede for Abrams sake, And of the same wil kinreds great and many Nations make. 37 There Isaac an Alter built and cald vpon his name, And in that place did pitch his tent, and dwelled in the same. 38 And there his seruauntes digd a Wel, and Water had good store: There was no strife about the same as others made before. 39 From Gerar, kyng Abimelech, his Frend Ahuzzath eeke, And Phicoll his chiefe capitayne came Isaac to seeke. 40 Whom when that Isaac behelde and cause of comming knewe, He sayd, wherfore come you to me and haue me put from you? 41 And hated me and Seruaunts myne, and banisht me awaye From where I dwelt, and where I myght haue dwelled til this daye. 42 Sayd they, in seyng wee haue seene the Lord is still with thee, And therfore thus among our selues we sayd and do agree. 43 Let there an Oth and Bond be made thy selfe and vs betwene, That thou no hurt do vnto vs: for why, thy selfe hath sene 44 We haue not touched thee nor thyne, to harme in any thynge, But suff'red thee to passe in peace and with thee hether brynge, 45 Thy Stuffe, thy Corne. thy seruauntes all, thy Cattel and thy store, And now I know thou blessed art of God for euermore 46 Then Isaac a feast them made, They eat and dranke together, And early in the Morne betyme ech one did sweare to other. 47 And after when the oth was made, Isack away th? sent, In peace from him departed they, and backe agayn they went. 48 And that same day it happened his men that digde the grounde Came vnto hym, and sayd, a Well wyth water haue wee found. 49 Then he the Well did Shebah call which is, an Oth to name: The Towne is called Betsheba, which yet doth beare the same. 50 And as Shebah doth signify a sacred Oth or Band, So Bersheba the Wel of th' Othe you must it vnderstand. 51 When Esaw was yeares forty old to wyfe he tooke these twayne And they vnto his parentes mynde were both a griefe and payne, For that they disobedient were and filled with disdayne.

Therfore thy weapons take in hand thy Quyuer and thy Bow, That thou for me may Uenson take abrode where thou shalt goe: 4 And make me meate such as I loue that eate therof may I, And that my soule may Esau blesse before that I do dye. 5 Rebecca heard, when Isaac vnto his sonne thus spake: And Esau went vnto the field some Uenson for to take. 6 But she vnto her yonger sonne that Iacob had to name Declared all what shee had heard and thus discourst the same: 7 Behold I heard thy father talke with Esau brother thyne, Who sayd to hym, goe Uenson catch that I therwyth may dyne, 8 And that I may before the Lord my blessyng geue to thee: Wherefore my sonne geue eare (sayd she) and do thus after me 9 Goe to the flocke and bringe me thence two Ryddes, that I may make Some meate therwith, thy father loues: and thou the same shal take 10 And bryng it to thy father so to eate, and that he may Blesse thee my Sonne before the Lord or yet his dying day: 11 Then Iacob to his Mother sayd beholde my Brother is A man that's rough, and I am smooth my father feeling this 12 Shall thynke I went him to beguyle, and so shal angry be, By which in stede of Blessyng good A Curse shall brynge on me. 13 Thy curse sayd she vpon me fall, my sonne hear thou my voyce: Goe fetch the kyddes: so forth he went of twayne made he his choyce And brought them to his mother deare vnto her great reioyce: 14 Wherof his mother made such meate as father his did loue And to the end the better she suspicion myght remoue, 15 She brought the garmentes gay to see that Esau wont to weare And put them on young Iacobs backe the same about to beare. 16 Also about his handes she wrapt vpon his necke lykewyse Which faire and smoth was to beholde in euery bodyes eies, 17 The skinnes of Goates that hairy were and rough as Esaus skinne. And Meat and Drynke in order drest to Iacobs hand put in. 18 And he therwith vnto his Syre such time as he did come Sayd, Father myne: who answered: but who art thou my sonne? 19 I am (sayd he) thine eldest sonne and Esau is my name, And haue according to thy best, performed heere the same 20 Sit vp and eate of Uenson myne and so refreshed be, And that thy soule before the Lorde may blessing geue to me. 21 Sayd Isaaac vnto his sonne, how commeth it to passe, That thou so quickely Uenson found I pray thee show the case: Thy God (sayd he) vnto my hand did bryng it where I was 22 Sayd Isaac come neare my sonne, that I may feele thee, so The trueth to knowe, whether that thou be Esau, yea or no: 23 So Iacob to his father went, and hee hym felt as tho. The voyce (sayd hee) is Iacobs voyce, but Esaus, handes I know. 24 He knew hym not because his handes were cou'red wyth the skynne Whych roughe and hearye did appeare, as Esaus handes had bene. 25 Art thou Esaw my sonne? Sayd hee I am, and so confesse. Bring me thy venson onne to eate, that thee my soule may blesse, 26 And so he brought him meat and wyne: he eat and dranke apace, Com neare my Sonne (sayd Isaac) and kysse me on the face. 27 So he vnto his father went, and when he had him kist, He smelt the sauer of his Clothes, and saying thus: him blist: 28 Behold the smell of my sweete Sonne is as the pleasaunt field, Which God hath blest with much encrease of Plentie great to yelde. 29 God geeue thee of the Dewe of Heauen, with fatnesse of the Earth: And plentie both of Corne and wyne, whyle lyfe shall lend the breath. 30 Let people great thy seruauntes bee, and Nacions to thee bowe, Be Lorde ouer thy Brethren all, a happie man art thou. 31 Also thy Mothers Children shall to thee obedient be: And curst be hee, that curseth thee: but blessed shall he bee That shall thee blesse aboue the rest, thus haue I blessed thee. 32 And Isahac no sooner had, made end of blessing so: And that young Iacob scarse was gone his fathers presence fro: 33 But in from hunting Esau came, and meate did ready make: And to his father brought the same, that hee thereof might take: 34 And sayd, now see my father ryse, and eate of Uenson myne, Which am thy Sonne, and that thy Soule may blesse me, who am thyne. 35 Sayd Isahack, why, who art thou? I am (then aunswered hee) Thyne eldest Sonne that hunted haue, and Uenson brought to thee. 36 Then Isaac astonied was and thus wise gan hee saye, Why? which is hee, and where is hee mee Uenson brought to day? 37 Of which I haue before thou came eaten vnto my fyll, And haue him blest, aboue the rest, and blessed shalbee still. 38 When Esau heard these wordes proceede from Father in such sort, He wept and cryed exceedinglye more then I can report. 39 And in the bitternesse of Hart vnto his father spake And him besought, that blessing his hee would vpon him make. 40 Sayd Isaac, ere thou came in but euen a little while, Thy Brother hath thy blessing tane with subtiltie and guyle. 41 He Iacob wel may called bee (sayd Esau brother his) For twyse hee vndermined mee as shall appeare by this. 42 First he my Byrthright tooke away and now hath tane also My blessing, which thou promist mee when I to hunt did goe: But father is no blessing left for me? I pray thee showe. 43 My Sonne behold (sayd Isaac) thy Lord I haue him made: And eke his mothers children all shall serue him in their trade. 44 Besydes, I haue with Corne and Wyne, him blest where ere hee goe, What can I doe for thee my Sonne, since this hath hapned so? 45 Ah Father myne (sayd Esau then) is al thy blessing gone? Or els of blessing hadst thou not no moe but this same one? 46 Blesse mee also, good Father myne, most humbly do I pray, And therewithall did Esau weepe his Father then did saye: 47 My Sonne thy dwelling place shalbe the fatnesse of the Earth, And from aboue the dew of Heauen, whyle lyfe shall spare the Breath. 48 And by thy sworde eke shalt thou lyue and Brothers seruaunt bee: Also thus shall it come to passe, and happen vnto thee, 49 That when thou shalt the maystrie get of Iacob Brother thyne: Then from thy necke, thou shalt his yoke, vnlose and eke vntwyne. 50 The hatred then was great that grew in this same Esaus breast, Against his Brother, for because, his Father so him blest. 51 And in his froward hart thus sayd, the dayes are yet not long Of Fathers death: when as I trow I wyll reuenge this wrong. 52 These wordes were brought Rebecca to, and she for Iacob sent And sayd thy Brother threatneth thee, to kill thee hee is bent 53 Therfore my Sonne, heare thou my voyce and do thee ready make, And flee my Brother Laban to, who wil thee vndertake 54 Safelye to keepe, tyl Brothers wrath be turnde away from thee, And that the thing which thou hast done to him forgotten bee. 55 Then wil I sende to fetch thee thence, and thou shalt come away: Ah why should I be desolate of both you in one daye? 56 Rebecca to her husband went, and spake with feeble breth, I weary am of lyfe (sayd shee) for Daughters now of Heth. 57 If Iacob take a wyfe of them, or such as here do fall: Ah woe is mee, my lyfe shall than do mee no good at all. [Cap. 28.] The Contentes of the XXVIII. Chapiter. Iacob is sent to haue a wyfe, to Laban, Vncle his: And Esau eke a wyfe doth take, an Ismaelite that is. How Iacob Dreames and makes a vowe, the tenth of all to giue., How Iesus Christe is promised, by whom wee all do liue. 1 Then Isaac for Iacob cal'de, hee blessed him, and sayd: I charge thee take no Wyfe of these where wee thus longe haue stayd. 2 But rise and get thee to the house of Bethuel, Graundsyre thine, Who Father to thy Mother is, and louinge Wyfe of mine. 3 And there amonge the Daughters such, of Laban, Bethuels Sonne: Thou shalt a wife from thence chose out, as I tofore haue donne. 4 And God Almighty do the blesse, and make the great to grow, And multiply thy Seede on Earth, so mighty for to showe: 5 That Multitudes of People maye springe forth, and growe by thee, And blessinge geue of Abraham, with thee and thine to bee. 6 And that thou maist the Land possesse, a straunger where thou art, Which God hath geuen to Abraham, so Iacob did depart: 7 And to Mesopotamia, to Bethuels sonne he went: And did performe his Fathers hest in euery thinge hee ment. 8 When Esau sawe that Isaac had Brother Iacob blest, And to Mesopotamia howe hee was redy prest: 9 And how that as he blessed him, he gaue him charge also To take no woman vnto wife of Canaan to know. 10 But that he should a wife fetche thence from whence his mother came, And saw his father liked not, the Seede of Canaan. 11 He also went to Ismael and daughter his did take And to those wiues he then possest, a wife of her did make. 12 As Iacob went to Haran ward a place he chaunced on, Where as he taried al the night because the sunne was gone: 13 And of that place a stone he toke vnder his head to set, And layd him downe, his head theron, and thus a while he slept. 14 And in the same, behold be dreamd, a Ladder longe to see: That stode on Earth, the toppe wherof to Heauen did seme to be. 15 Upon the same went vp and downe Gods Angelles, in his sight. And God vpon the Ladder stode wyth Countnaunce shininge bright, 16 Which said: I am the Lord, and God of Abraham that's past, Likewise the God of Isaac: that euermore shal last. 17 The Land where on thou sleepest now I will gyue vnto thee, And to thy sede that's yet to come which after thee shalbe. 18 And as the Dust vpon the Earth thy Seede so wil I make: For multitude (vnspeakable) this wil I for thy sake. 19 And thou shalt spred abrode on Earth alonge vnto the West, And to the East, the North and Southe, as I haue the exprest. And thorow thee and seede of thee all Kinredes shalbe blest. 20 Behold and see I am wyth the and wil the kepe also In euery place where thou shalt passe, or where thy feete shal goe. 21 And backe againe vnto this Land I wyl thee safely bring: And wil performe what I haue said to thee in eu'ry thing. 22 When Iacob from his sleepe awoke wyth heauy chere and sad, The Lord (sayd he) is in this place and I no knowledge had. 23 Afraid he was, and therefore said how fearefull is this place? It is I see, of God the house of Heauen the gate to passe. 24 So Iacob earely in the morne stode vp and toke the stone Which he had layd, vnder his head to make a pillow on. 25 And pitched it vpon an ende, and as the Text doth tel. Hee powred Oyle on top thereof, and nam'd the place Bethell: 26 Which Luz before that time was cal'de. and Iacob vowd a vowe: If God, sayd he will be with mee in this my iourney now; 27 And wil me keepe and geue me breade, and clothes to couer me: So that vnto my fathers house, I come agayne may bee. 28 Then sure the Lord shalbe my God; and this same Stone you see, Which I haue set vpon an ende the house of God shalbe. 29 And also will of euery thinge, that thou to me shalt giue The tenth thereof, geue thee againe, all dayes that I shall liue. [Cap. 29.] The Contentes of the XXIX Chapter. Sauen Yeares doth Iacob Laban serue For Rachel, Labans Childe. Vnto his bed is Leah brought, And Iacob is beguilde, Hee marieth both, and serueth yet seuen yeares for Rachell more, And Leah doth Conceiue, and beare and prayseth God therefore. 1 Then Iacob lyfted vp his Feete, to pace his iourney oute, And came to Country of the East, and as hee lookt about: 2 Behold, in field there was a Wel and Flockes of Sheepe hard by, And on the mouth of that same Well, a mighty Stone did lye. 3 So thyther were the Flockes al brought, that they might water take, And then the Stone was rold away, more roome for Sheepe to make: 4 And when the Sheepe had dronke their fill they put the Stone agayne Upon the Wel, til watring tyme the Mouth did close remayne. 5 Sayd Iacob then, vnto those men, my Brethren whence are ye? Of Haran Syr, (sayd they) we are: and Shepeheardes as you see. 6 And know you Laban then sayd hee) that Nahors Sonne should bee? We know him very wel sayd they: a vertuous man is hee. 7 And is hee in good health or not? I pray you do me tell In health (sayd they) and see where comes his Daughter young Rahell. Driuing the Flocke of Fathers Sheepe to bring vnto thys Well. 8 It is but early day (sayd hee) too sone haue you brought hyther: It is not tyme the Cattel should be gathred yet together, 9 But insomuch as ye be heere and by the Well remayne, Water the sheepe and so departe that they may feede agayne. 10 We may not so, our custome is to gather all in one: Then from the mouth of this same Well wee rolle away the Stone. And so we water all our sheepe and backe agayne are gone. 11 Whyle hee yet talked with those men young Rahel came apace With Fathers sheepe, for shee them kept: and when shee was in place, 12 No sooner had young Iacob seene, this Rahel in the face: But from the Well he rold the Stone and so in little space 13 He watered the Flocke of Sheepe, that Rahel thyther brought: Which Flocke of Sheepe Laban (in deede) his mothers Brother ought. 14 And Iacob there did Rahel kysse and lifted vp his voyce, And wept and shed such teares of ioye, as men that much reioyce. 15 Hee told her then, how that he was her fathers brothers Sonne She ranne and told her father all, what was both sayd and done. 16 UUhen Laban heard of Iacob there his Sisters Sonne to bee, He ranne to meete, and him embrast, and welcome (sayd) to mee. 17 And when hee had him frendlye kist, home to his house him brought, And Iacob there to Laban told the matter all in thought Which hee against his brother had by mothers counsell wrought. 18 Sayd Laban than, thou art my bone and eke my Flesh also. And heee abode a Month with him about his worke to goe. 19 Though thou (said hee) my Brother bee should thou for nought serue mee? Tel mee what shal thy wages bee and I will geeue it thee. 20 This Laban now two daughters had, and Lea was the one, And Rahel shee, the youngst of twaine was fayr'st to looke vpon. 21 And Iacob Rahel loued well: and therfore sayd in fyne: Seuen yeares I wyl thy seruaunt bee for Rahell daughter thyne. 22 Much better t'is sayd Laban tho my daughter thyne to bee Then his vnknowne a straunger borne, and from my kinred free. I am content it shalbe so abyde here styl with me. 23 For Rahel, Iacob thus became to Laban bound as tho, Those yeares with him few dayes did seeme his loue encreased so. 24 And when seuen yeares expired were: geeue mee my wife, sayd hee, That I may know her as I ought, for now I am set free. 25 Then Laban Father to the Mayde together streight did cal The Men and Brethren of that place and so did feast them all. 26 When Night was come, hee Leah tooke and vnto Iacob brought, And Iacob went as Custome was to Rahel (as hee thought) 27 But when the Morning did appeare the matter for to trye, Behold Leah, not Rahel t'was with Iacob that did lye. 28 Wherfore? (sayd Iacob) hast thou playd this subtil part with mee, Did I not serue for Rahel thyne this seuen yeares past with thee? Wherfore hast thou thus me beguilde as al these People see? 29 To whom thus Laban aunswered: the maner of this place Is not the youngest to preferre before the eldest face. 30 Passe out this weeke, then shal this Mayde be geeuen to thee also, And for the same thou shalt mee geeue, seuen yeares of seruice moe. 31 So Iacob did, and passed out the weeke as was the guise, Then Laban Rahel gaue to him to bee his wife likewise. 32 So Iacob now, two wyues possess but Rahel loued hee, For whom hee serued Fourtene yeares, and after was set free. 33 When God did see, how Iacob did Lea his Wyfe dispise, Hee blest her Wombe, and fruictfull made before the Peoples Eyes: 34 But Rahell, whom hee lyued best, did barren yet become. And Lea shee conceiued streight and brought him forth a sonne. 35 And Ruben called shee his name: and sayd the Lorde did see My sorrowe greate, and therefore nowe my Husbande will loue mee: 36 And shee againe conceiued was, and so to passe it cam: The Lord hath hard and seene (saith shee) that I dispised am: 37 And therefore hath this Sonne me geuen, to feede my ioyes vpon. And so her second Sonne shee cal'de by name of Simeon. 38 The third time yet conceiued shee, an other Sonne him bare. For this sayth shee my husband now, my company wil not spare. 39 Because I haue three sonnes hym borne, to make him glad wythall: And therfore shee her third sonne nam'de, and Leuy did him call. 40 And she the fourth time dyd conceiue and bare another sonne, Sayd she, now will I prayse the Lord for this that hee hath donne. 41 And Iuda called shee this Childe. and so shee bare no moe: Till afterward it pleased God his blessinge great to shoe. [Cap. 30.] The Contentes of the XXX Chapter. Rahell, and Lea both in Barrennesse do ly ue: Both geue their maydes their Husbands til and they hym Children gyue. Lea geues Mandragore to Rahell wyth good wyl, That Iacob myght wyth Lea lye, that Nyght her mynde to fill. How Laban Rych is made for this same Iacobs sake, And Iacob Rich is made also, and so his leaue doth take. 1 When Rahell saw, the Iacob by no Childe as yet could beare: Shee at her Sister enuy had, and sayd to Iacob there: 2 Geue children vnto me also, else presently I dye. Then Iacob angry was with her, and sayd a GOD am I? 3 Or in Gods steed? which hath withheld of Children fruict from thee? Behold, sayth shee, there is my Mayde go in to her, and shee 4 Shal Children beare vpon my Lappe, and I the same will take And as my owne, vpon my Knee will dandle for thy sake. 5 So thus her handmaide did shee geue, her husbandes Wyfe to bee: By whom this Maide conceiued was, and forth a Sonne brought shee: Sayd Rahell then, God hath me heard and sentence geuen with mee: 6 For why, the Lord hath heard my voyce, I well perceiue the same: And hath mee geuen a goodly Boye, and Dan shee cal'de his name. 7 Agayne Bilha conceiued was, and bare another Sonne: Sayd Rahel, now by wrestlinge thus I haue the maistery won 8 And got of Lea Sister mine, the Godly victorie: So named shee her second Sonne, and cal'de him Naphtalie, 9 When Lea sawe shee bearinge left, more Children could not haue: Shee Silpha cooke, her Mayde that was and to hir husband gaue: Soe Iacob tooke her vnto wyfe and shee brought him a Lad, 10 Sayd Lea now a Company comes and so did cal hym Gad. 21 Againe this Silpha (Leas mayd) another sonne him bare: Ah blest am I, said Lea then for Daughters al that are Will blesse me now and so that sonne shee called him Assar. 12 Now Ruben Iacobs eldest sonne, and first of Lea borne Went forth in Dayes of wheat Haruest when shocked was the Corne. 13 And found by chaunce Mandragoras, in field as he did goe: Which is an herbe, whose roote men say, the shape of man doth showe. 14 To Lea did he giue the same, that then his Mother was: Said Rahel, Sister giue me of thy Sonnes Mandragoras. 15 I'st not enoughe, sayd Lea then: that thou my husband haue? But would my Sonnes Mandragoras away likewyse to craue? 16 If that thy Sonnes Mandragoras thou wylt gyue vnto me: I am content that Iacob shal this Night goe sleepe wyth thee. 17 So Lea gaue Mandragoras and Rahel was content: At euen as Iacob homeward came, to meete him Lea went, 18 And sayd: come vnto mee sweete hart, this Night I haue the bought: Wyth my swete Sonnes Mandragoras which neuer cost me ought. 19 And so that Night wyth her he slept and God did Lea heare: She did conceyue and so by him her fift Sonne did she beare. 20 Sayd she, God hath rewarded mee because my Mayde I gaue, And Isachar shee cald her Sonne for so shee would him haue. 21 And Lea yet conceiu'de agayne and brought the sixt Sonne foorth: God hath mee now endude (shee sayd) with Dowrye much in worth. 22 Now wil my husband dwel with mee to feede my ioyes vpon: Because sixe Sonnes I haue him borne and cald him Zabulon. 23 A Daughter yet she after bare and Dina was her name: And God remembred Rahel too, and did her keepe from blame. 24 He heard her voyce, and frutefull made a Mother for to bee, So when shee was deliu'red of a goodly Boy to see: 25 The Lord hath taken my rebuke now cleane away, sayth she, And Ioseph named shee her Sonne and sayd, Lorde geeue to mee Another Sonne to play withall if so thy pleasure bee. 26 So soone as Rahel, had brought forth young Ioseph, Iacobs Sonne: To Laban, Iacob went and sayd, thou knowest what I haue d?ne. 27 I haue thee serued Fourtene yeares truly, vnto this daye: Geeue mee my Wyues and Children now that I may goe my waye. 28 Unto my Countrye whence I came, and where my father dwelles: I pray thee send me safe from hence I aske thee nothing elles. 29 To whome thus Laban aunswered: if I haue fauour found Before thyne eyes, or in thy sight, let mee to this bee bound. 30 To geeue thee what thou shalt require thy choise whereof to make: For why, I know the lyuing Lord hath blest mee for thy sake. 31 Thou knowste (sayd Iacob) vnto him my seruice done to thee And in what sort thy cattel was, and haue bene vnder mee. 32 Before I came thy Heardes were small but now encreased mich, The Lord hath blest thee for my sake and thus hath made thee rych. 33 But when shall I prouision make, for housholde mine also? Sayd hee, what shall I geeue thee then before thou hence do goe? 34 Thou shalt (sayd Iacob) geeue mee nought saue this thing doe for mee: And then wyll I come backe agayne, and Sheepe keepe vnder thee. 35 I wyl this day goe to thy Sheepe, and separation make, And those that after flecked be, for my rewarde I'le take, 36 And all the blacke amonge the Lambes and such as colours haue, Among the Kyddes, that spotted bee is all that I do craue, 37 So shal my righteousnesse declare to morow this for mee, When I shall come for my rewarde before the face of thee. 38 And euery one among the Goates that is not speckled tho, And blacke among the Sheepe lykewise, as I to thee do show: 39 Let that bee theft vnto my charge to aunswere ere I goe. Go too, go too, sayd Laban than, would God it might bee so According to thy Saying now or as thy hart doth know. 40 And Laban out the same day tooke al Goates that colours had, And all the blacke among the Shepe as well the good as bad. 41 And made his Sonnes the Heardes of them and three dayes iourney set Betwene himselfe, and Iacob thus: and Iacob did not let 42 To take the charge of all the rest of Labans other Sheepe That of one colour did appeare, and did them safely keepe. 43 And Iacob tooke of Popler greene, of Hasell Roddes also, And Chestnut trees, and pyld the Rynde and made the whyte to show: 44 And put these Roddes before the Sheepe in Trough or watring place: To th' end they might conceiue thereby the roddes before their face: 45 Thus when they water came to drinke, they were conceiued streight, And brought foorth Lambes that spotted were, vy reason of this sleight. 46 And Iacob then did part these Lambes that were bespotted so, And turnde the faces of the Flocke that Labans was to know, 47 Towardes these Lambes of partie hue and to all colours blacke That was among this Labans Flocke but yet hee did keepe backe 48 His Flockes of Sheepe that spotted were, and by themselues did keepe, So that no tyme hee suffered theim to bee with Labans Sheepe: 49 In Ramming tyme of stronger Sheepe Iacob his Roddes did lay In Gutters when they came to drinke, whereon their eyes might stay 50 And so conceiue, and Lambes foorth bring that flecked were to see: But in the Ramming time of yeare when Sheepe most feeble bee, 51 He did forbeare his Rodds to lay, where by the stronger Sheepe Were Iacobs al: the weaker sort were Labans for to keepe. 52 Thus Iacob grew exceeding rich, and had a mightie stocke Of Seruauntes eke and Camels too and Asses in his Flocke. [Cap. 31.] The Contentes of the XXXI. Chapter. How Labans Children grudge agaynst this Iacobs wealth: Of Iacobs backe returne homeward againe by stealth: Rabell her Fathers Gods, vpon Sheepeshearinge day, The same did filche, and steale, and bare them so away: How Laban followeth fast Iacob to ouertake: And of the Heape of stones, and cou'naunt that they make. 1 Now Lab?s Children spake in words that Laban thought in heart. And Iacob heard how that they sayde our Father feeleth smart, 2 For Iacob hath tane all away our Fathers was before, And hath him selfe this honour got, by Fathers goodes, and store. 3 And Iacob Laban well behelde his Countenaunce, and there: Which was not now as heretofore but as hee angry were. 4 And then the Lord to Iacob sayd, returne thee home agayne Into the Land where Father thine and Kinred do remayne, 5 For I will bee with thee, sayth God, whereof Iacob was glad. And sent for both his Wyues to Fielde, and to the Flocke hee had: 6 And when they came his presence to, I see (sayd hee) at last, Your Fathers Countenaunce, to mee is not, as in time past. 7 How beit, the God of Father mine, hath bin with mee this Night: And both you know, how Father yours, I seru'de with all my Might: 8 And yet hee oft deceiued mee, in chaunginge of my Wage: But God no time woulde suffer him, to hurt mee in his Rage: 9 For when hee sayde the spotted Sheepe thy hyred Wage shalbe: Then all the Sheepe, bespotted were, as you can witnes mee: 10 And when hee sayde, the straked Sheepe, shall thee reward for Hier: Then all the Sheepe bestraked were, as one would it desier. 11 Thus hath the Lord, your Fathers Sheepe from him, now tane away, And of his goodnes geuen them mee, as you do see this Daye. 12 It thus befell in Ramminge time, when in a Dreame I was: Mine Eyes I lifted vp, and sawe, and so it came to passe 13 Beholde the Sheepe that straked were, and spotted here, and there, The Rammes, vppon their Backes did Leape, in Place whereas they were. 14 And in my Dreame Gods Angell spake, and thus gan saye to mee: Iacob: and him I aunswered, Lord, here I am by thee. 15 Sayd hee, lift vp thine Eyes, and see the Rammes leape on the Sheepe That spotted are, and straked bee, and party Coullour keepe. 16 I haue seene all that Laban doth, or can against thee make: For I the God of Bethel am, where thou didste vndertake 17 The Stone to pitch vpon an ende, and did Annoynte the same, And where thou mad'ste a solemn Uow vnto my Sacred Name: 18 Now therfore rise, and get the hence out from this Countrey here, And backe returne vnto the Land where Rebek did the beare. 19 When Rahell, and her Sister to did Iacob vnderstand: Hath not (sayd they) thy seruice long, bought vs of Fathers hand? 20 For hee hath Soulde vs vnto thee, and wee therewith content, And hee consumed hath our Coyne, and all wee see is spent. 21 But haue wee any Portion else? or hath hee geuen vs more Then that thy Seruice longe time Bought? as wee haue sayde before? 22 For all the Richesse, God hath tane away from Father so, Is ours, and eke our Childrens to, as God to thee did shoe. 23 And therefore what so euer God hath spoken vnto thee: Do that, accordinge to his will: so happy shall wee bee. 24 Then Iacob rose, and set his Sonnes, and Wiues on Camels backe, And caried thence his Flocke away, and nothinge seem'de to lacke. 25 And all his Substance which he had procured, as you heare: His Riches, and Possessions too, which hee had gotten there 26 He droue them forth to Isaac his Father for to goe Vnto the Land of Canaan that hee before came fro: 27 Now when as Laban went to sheare his Sheepe as other hid Rabell purloynd her Fathers Gods: and secretly them hide. 28 Thus Iacob Labans hart did steale because he went away, And would not let hym vnderstand of his remouing Daye. 29 So priuily he went his way wyth al that ere he had, And past the Ryuer Euphrates towardes Mount Gilead. 30 And three Dayes after Iacobs flight was worde to Laban brought, Who after, with his Brethren went the same for to haue caught. 31 And seuen dayes iourney in pursute they after him did make, And when vnto the Mount they came they did him ouertake. 32 And God by Night to Laban came and in a Dream did say, Take hede thou speake nothing but good to Iacob in the way. 33 Then Laban Iacob ouertooke as he in Iourney went And Iacob in mount Gilead there pitched downe his Tent. 34 And Laban pitched there his Tent with Brethren his also Sayd Laban vnto Iacob then what made thee thus to goe? 35 Why hast thou stolne my hart away and Daughters twayn with thee As though they had with Sword and Targe pore Captyues taken be. 36 Wherfore went thou thus secretelye away from me vnknowne? And did not say, let me depart with that which is myne owne? 37 And that I myght wyth melody haue brought thee on the way And kissed so my Daughters deare at their departing day. 38 Thou wast a foole thus wise to do thou knowest I am stronge And able am to doe thee ill, and to reuenge this wrong. 39 But sure the God of Father yours spake yesternight with me, Take hede thou speake but that is good Iacob vnto, (sayd he) 40 And though desyre thus prick thee forth thy fathers house to see: Yet wherfore hast thou filcht and stolne my Goddes away with thee? 41 I was afrayd, sayd Iacob then, my Wyues thou wouldst denay, And therfore did we priuily conuey our selues away. 42 But where as Theft thou layest to me, looke where the same shal fall, Let hym streight dye, on whom its found before our Brethren all. 43 Now serch and seke, and if thou fynde of thyne that is with me, Let me abyde rebuke thereof, and take it vnto thee. 44 But Iacob knew not how his wyfe who Rahel had to name, Had stolne away her fathers Goddes and closely kept the same. 45 Then Laban came to Iacobs Tent and Leahs tent also, And searched in the mayd?s Tent but found them not: and so From Leahs Tent departing he to Rahels Tent did goe 46 Now Rahel had ere father came his Ydols taken out, And hid them in the Camells Straw: hir father sought abowt. 47 But stil she sat vppon the Straw wherein the Ydolles lay, To Laban then her father she with feeble voyce did say: 48 My Lord (sayd she) not angry be most humbly I do pray, That I do not aryse to thee for skarse I able may: 49 Because the course of Women now is on me all this daye: Thus Laban sought but found them not and so went he his way. 50 Then Iacob wrothe and angry was and did with Laban chyde, And sayd, what trespas haue I done, or what hast thou espyde 51 In mee? or these that are with me that thou shoulde vs pursue? Thou ransackt hast my stuffe ech whit: hast thou found vs vntrue? 52 What hast thou found of all that's thyne abiding here with me? Put it before our brethren here to iudge twene me and thee. 53 Behold I haue these Twenty Yeares bene faythful Seruaunt thyne, Thy Sheepe and Goates not Barrayne were but fruitful in the time. 54 Ne did thy Ewes yet cast their Yong, the Rams eke of thy flocke I haue not eate, but alwayes haue maintayned stil thy stocke: 55 And what so ere was torne by Beastes or perisht in the Wood, I neuer brought it vnto thee, my selfe did make it good. 56 For of my handes didst thou requyre the same for to repay, As though with Theues it had bene stolne by Night or els by day. 57 And in the Day the heat of Sunne consumed me ful sore And in the night the bitter frost with cold did nip me more. 58 Thus Day and Night in heat &amp; cold I seldome tyme haue slept, So careful was I on the charge of cattel thyne I kept. 59 Thus haue I spent these xx. Yeares and in thy House remayne, And Fourteene of these twenty yeres was for thy daughters twayne 60 And sixe yeres seruice for thy shepe I kept vpon the Plaine. Yet thou my wages chaunged hast too many times certaine. 61 Except the God of Father mine, the God of Abraham, And eke the God whom Isack fear'd and God that to me cam: 62 Had ben wyth me, thou surely had me empty sent away, And geuen me nought for seruice long as I haue sayd this Daye. 63 But God beheld my troubles great and labours of my hand, And thee rebuked yester night thy selfe dost vnderstande. 64 Now Labans conscience moued was and sought a Peace to make, And therefore vnto Iacob sayd this wil I vndertake. 65 These Daughters twayn my Daughters are, these Sonnes are also mine: These shepe and al thou seest beside are myne as wel as thyne: 66 And what can I this Day then doe to these my Daughters heere Or to their sonnes, which they haue borne, that in my sight appeere? 67 Come now therefore and let vs make A league most firme to be Whiche may a wytnes bee for aye betwene my selfe and thee. 68 They both agreed and Iacob toke a stone, and set it right Up, lyke a Piller for to stande In euery bodies sight. 69 Then Iacob to his brethren sayde take you vp stones likewyse And so they did, and made an heape as best they could devise. 70 And on the heape of stones that was they sat them downe to Eate: Great frendes, they were and gently did each other wel intreate 71 This heape of stones did Laban call and Iacob eke also. In both theyr tongues the Witnes heape, for euery one to knowe. 72 This heape said Laban witnes is twene me and thee this day, Therfore he cald it Galeed the lyke did Iacob saye 73 Sayd Laban then, Mizpah also this heape shal called be Because the Lord when we depart, shal loke twene me and thee. For if my Daughters thou shalt vexe, or other wyues shal take, Besyde my Daughters now thy wyues: or Doughters myne forsake: 75 Behold her's none but we our selues, God shal the witnesse beare: This heape and Piller eke beholde. that's set betwixt vs here. 76 These witnesse shal I wil not come ouer this heap to thee, And that thou shalt not passe the same for any harme to me. 77 And now the God of Abraham and Nabors God also. And eke the God of fathers theirs be iudge betwene vs two. 78 But Iacob sware by th' onely God whom Isaac did feare, And offer did a Sacrifyce vppon the Mountayne there And after did his brethren call, that eate of bread they myght. And they did eate and in the Mount did tary all the nyght. 80 In morne betyme did Laban ryse and all his Children kist, And so went homeward to his place after he had them blist. [Cap. 32.] The Contentes of the XXXII. Chapiter Gods Angels here with Iacob met and he doth Presentes send Vnto his Brother by his Men and doth himselfe c?mend, Eke with an Angel wrestled he, and yet receiu'd no fal: The Angel chaungeth Iacobs name and doth him Isrel call. 1 But Iacob went his iourney on and by the way him met The Angels of Almighty God in battell order set: 2 And when that Iacob them beheld he sayd himselfe within, This is Gods host: and so the place he namde Mahanaim. 3 And Iacob sent his messengers vnto the land of Seir, And to the Field that Edom was where Esaus Armyes weir. 4 And he commaunded each of them, thus shal you speake (sayth he) To Esau my most louing Lord that brother is to me: 5 Thy seruaunt Iacob hym commendes In humblest wise he may, And to your selfe in his behalfe thus much he bad me say. 6 I haue longe time a straunger bene wyth Laban vncle myne, And twenty yeres haue soiourned wyth him vntil this tyme. 7 And haue of Oxen, Asses, Shepe, of men Seruauntes likewyse Of Women too, and that I may find fauore in thine eyes, 8 I haue sent word vnto my Lord to signifie the same, Accordinge as my dutye byndes as loth to meritte blame. 9 The Messengers to Esaw went and came againe wyth spede. And sayd, thy brother gainst thee brynges foure hundreth men in deede. 10 This newes made Iacob sore afrayd he wyst nat what to say Ne what to do, but yet at last he dyd deuise the way: 11 His people, sheepe and Cattell al for to deuide in twayne And toke great paynes to place the same in order to remayne. 12 Sayd he: If Esau come and smyte one part of people myne, The other parte, may leasure find to saue it selfe in tyme. 13 To God then Iacob sayd againe. O God of Abraham, God of my father Isaac, from out whose Loines I came: 14 Thou Lord which bad I should returne vnto my Country backe, Among my kynred for to dwell saying thou shalt not lacke: 15 For I my selfe will bee with thee and do al for the best: I say thou Lord wilt not forsake poore Iacob thus distrest: 16 And yet O Lorde I must confesse no whit I worthye am, No not the least of mercies thyne which from thy goodnesse cam: 17 That thou hast shewde thy seruaunte to, by day and eke by night, For with my staffe I ouercame this Iordan by thy might. 18 And now two Droues I gotten haue, behold Lord where they stand: Most mighty God deliuer mee from Brother Esaus hand. 19 For I much feare him, lest he wyl with wrathful rage possest With Furie come, and Mother strike with Children at her breast. 20 Thou sayd'st O Lord I surely wyll do good and good to thee. And make thy Seede as is the Sand within the Sea to see, The which can not for multitude, of any numbred bee. 21 And Iacob there abode that night, and such as came to hand Hee tooke thereof, and Presents made for Esau t'vnderstand. 22 Two hundreth Goates of Female kynde, and twentie Males also, Two hundred Ewes and twentye Rammes did hee appoint to goe, 23 And thirtie Camels Mylke that gaue their Coltes them passing by, With Fourtie Kyne, and Bullockes tenne that fayre were to the eye. 24 Of shee Asses he twentye tooke, and Coltes tenne, them beside, Fyue hundred and fourskore were they that Iacob did prouide. 25 And so into his seruauntes handes, these Droues deliu'red hee, And eu'rye Droue was by it selfe appointed so to bee. 26 And hee vnto his Seruaunts sayd: before mee passe the way, And put a space tweene Droue and Droue, and furthermore did saye, 27 To him that formost was of all among the Droues to see: If that my brother doe thee meete and hap to aske of thee: 28 Whose man art thou? and whose are these? and whither doest thou goe? In humble wyse with reuerent speach thou shalt vnto him showe: 29 Sir these thy Seruaunt Iacobs be, and are by him assignd A present sent to thee my Lord, himselfe comes vs behinde. 30 So likewise to the second Man, the thyrd, and all the rest, Commaunded hee with Droues that came as was to him exprest. 31 And more (sayd hee) thus shall you say, when you do Esau fynde, Behold thy seruaunt Iacob comes, as dutie doth him bynde. 32 For thus hee thought, I wyl his wrath with giftes before appease, And after will I see his face if that my Lord so please: It may be, hee wil mee accept with Comfort, Ioy, and Ease. 33 So with these Presentes foorth they went in order as they might, But Iacob with the company abode behynde that night. 34 And in the Night did Iacob ryse and his two wyues also: His Maydens twayne, his Children all, Eleuen which were tho Ouer the Foord with them he went that Iabbok is to know. 35 And sent away all that he had the ryuer for to passe, But hee himselfe behinde did staye, for so his goodwill was. 36 And as alone hee stayd behynde a man him met by th' waye. That stroue and wrestled styl with him vntil the breake of daye. 37 And when this man might not preuayle Iacob to ouerthrow, He Iacob stroke vnder the Thigh and sayd, now let me go. The Sinew then of Iacobs Thigh did shrinke at that same blowe. 38 I wylt not let thee go, sayd hee, what man so ere thou bee, But wyl thee hold vntil such tyme thou Blessing geeue to me. 39 Said hee, then tell me whats thy name? I Iacob am by right: Thou shalt no more bee called so: but Israel in Gods sight. 40 For as a Prince thou wrestled hast with God, and eke with man, And hast preuayled in the thing that thou hast tane in hand. 41 Saide Iacob then, thy name also I pray thee shewe to mee: Wherfore sayd he, doest thou demaund what it my name should be? And in that place he blessed him and so away went hee. 42 And therfore Iacob, Peniel did nominate the Place: For I haue seene this day (sayd he) my God euen face to face. And so my lyfe preserued is by bountie of his grace. 43 As he went ouer Peniel the Sunne him rose vpon, So halted hee of that same Thigh, the Angel stroke him on. 44 The Israelites forbeare to eate The Synewe to this daye, That is in that place of the Thighe where Iacobs Synewe lay: 45 Because the man that stroue with him did touch the hollow place, Of Iacobs Thighe, wherein hereby the shronken Synewe was. [Cap. 33.] The Contentes of the XXXIII. Chapiter. Esau and Iacob are agreed, and Esau goes to Seir. And Iacob vnto Sichem went, and set his Tentes vp there. 1 Then Iacob lifting vp his eies his Brother did behold, And wyth hym came foure h?dreth men as erst to hym was tolde. 2 Then Iacob vnto both his Wyues, and to his Maidens twayne His Children put, ech by themselues in order to remayne. 3 The Maydens both and Children theyrs that he by them did get, The formost of the company in order did hee set. 4 And next to them he Lea plaste and Children hers also: And Rahell, last with her younge Sonne, appointed was to goe: 5 And then himselfe went them before, as Guide vnto them all: Seuen times ere hee his Brother mette, vppon the Ground did fall. 6 Esau hym met, embraced hym and frendly did him kisse, They both brast forth with Teares, and wept, great Ioy to see was this: 7 Then Esau lifted vp his eies and did the women see, And Children theyrs standing them by, whence hast thou these? sayth he: 8 And do these women and these youthes belonge or no to thee? They are (sayd he) thy Seruauntes Sonnes, which God hath geuen to mee. 9 Then came the Maydes wyth Children theirs and did obeysaunce showe, And Leah, wyth her Chyldren came: and did her dutye knowe. 10 And last of all came Ioseph forth his Mother Rahell too, Who gaue to him obeysaunce such as duty bad them doe 11 Sayd Esau vnto Iacob then what Droue is that I met, Of Goates, of Sheepe, of Camelles, Bulles, of Kyne, and other Neate. 12 My Lord sayd he, that fauour I may finde in sight of thee, I haue them sent vnto my Lord as present geuen from me. 13 Not so my Brother (Esau sayd) enough haue I in store, I neede them not, kepe that thou hast vnto thy selfe therefore. 14 Ah, nay, My Lord, but if I haue, found fauor in thy sight, Receyue this present from my handes and therein do me right. 15 For I this Day haue seene thy Face, as though I should beholde The Face of God, and thy good will both makes mee glad, and bolde. 16 Ah, take my blessinge that is brought, for God hath mercy showne. And so hee Esau did compell to take it for his owne. 17 When hee these Presentes had receiu'de, let vs (sayd hee now go: And I will leade the Waye before: my Lord (sayde hee) not so, 18 Thou know'ste the Children tender are, the Ewes with Younge bee great, So bee the Kine vnder my Hand: I shall my Lord entreate: 19 Least Men the Herd should ouerdriue, but euen one Day to try: Both Ewes, and Kine, and all the rest would perish by and by, 20 And therefore let my louinge Lord goe on before, ift please, And I will softly after come, and driue the Herd with ease: 21 So as the Cattell may endure, and Children able bee: I shall to Seir still follow on, and there my Lord will see. 22 Sayd Esau then, yet let mee leaue some of my Folke with thee. What needeth it my Lord (sayd he) this one thing graunt to mee, 23 That I maye grace, and fauour finde, before thy sight this Daye: For thereof haue I nede, my Lord, for which I humbly pray. 24 So now agayne did Esau go to Seir forthe on his way. And Iacob did his Iourney take to Suchot: which men say 25 Was called so, by reason of the Tentes and Bothes he made, Wherein his Cattel from the heate was cherisht in the shade. 26 And Iacob built him there an howse and so to Salem cam, Of Sichem whych a City is in Land of Canaan. 27 And this was after he came from Mesopotamia, Which is a Country longe and brode and sette in Asia. 28 Before this City did be pitch, his Tentes whereas he found Of Hamors brode, of whom he bought a certaine peece of Ground. And for the same in mony payd an hundreth peeces round. 29 And Iacob built an Aulter there to prayse the Lord wythal, And on the God of Israell continually did cal.

The rauishing of Dina fayre, that Iacobs daughter was, By Sichem Hamors sonne and Heyre who sought to bring to passe To haue this Dina to his wyfe, and so was borne in hand By brethren hers, who tooke the lyfe of Males all, in the Land. 1 Whylst Iacob there inhabited, in Salem t'vnderstand, His daughter Dina went to see the daughters of the Land. 2 When Sichem Hamors sonne her saw who Lord was of that Soyle Within his brest her beautie bred of Lust such burning broyle, 3 That hee by force this mayden tooke, her person did abuse, His hart on Dina was so layd hee had no power to chuse. 4 He spake her fayre, and loued her, as deare as his owne lyfe, And to his father Hamor sayd, get mee this mayd to wyfe. 5 Iacob this knew, but held his prace til hee his Sonnes might see: For they were keeping Beastes in field. as t'was their wont to bee. 6 And Hamor Sichems Father came and vnto Iacob went To common of his Sonnes request, was nothing els hee ment. 7 But when the Sonnes of Iacob came whose Sister Dina was, And heard by Sichems likinge Iewd what thing was come to passe: 8 It greeu'd them much, and wroth they were, hee had such folly wrought In Israel: which thing in deede no man to do so ought. 9 And Hamor vnto Iacob sayd the Soule of this my Sonne Doth long for Dina Daughter yours in maryed state to wonne. 10 Geeue her to wyfe, and ioyne with vs, your Daughters geeue also, And take our Daughters vnto you, wee may together grow. 11 So shall wee then together dwell the Land for you shalbee, Therein to doe as best you like, and haue possession free. 12 Then Sichem to her Father sayd and Brethren hers likewise, Uouchsafe this fauour I may fynde and Grace before your eyes. 13 And what soeuer you appoint that playnly wil I geeue: Demaund large Gyftes and Dowry both, it shall no whyt me greeue 14 Yea I wyl geeue according that which you shall say to mee: So that the Damsel you do geeue my spoused wyfe to bee, 15 Then Iacobs Sonnes sayd vnto them: wee cannot do this thinge, To geeue her one vncircumcis'd, should shame vpon vs bring. 16 Deceitfullye did Iacobs Sonnes to Sichem vse wordes mylde, Because their Sister Dina hee thus Lewdly had defilde. 17 In this wee wil consent, sayd they, if thou wilt bee as wee, Let all the males among you borne then Circumcised bee. 18 So will wee geeue you, daughters ours and yours wee'le take also, And wee will rest, and dwell with you, and so one people growe. 19 But if you will refuse to doe as you haue heard vs say, Wee wil our Daughter take againe and so depart away. These woordes did please them very well, to which they sayd not nay. 20 This Youngman would no time defer this thing to doe among, His Lust on Dina was so set he thought ech time too long. 21 Of all that were in Hamors house, none might compared bee To Sichem for of all the rest best thought vpon was bee: 22 Then Hamor and Sichem his Sonne vnto the Cittie went, And so before the gate thereof declared their entent 23 And sayd vnto the Citizens touching Iacobs request, Affirming that which Iacob sayd to bee all for the best. 24 They bee vnfaynde to vs, sayd he, and dwell within the Land, And do applye their busines with labor of their hand. 25 And in the Land is roume ynough for them here to remayne: Wee wyl their Daughters take to wyfe and geeue them oures agayne. 26 Herein they onely wil consent vnto vs, for to dwell And bee as people one with vs if you shall thinke it well. 27 That is if all the children borne which Males appeare to bee May circumcised bee like them, then wee and they agree. 28 For shall not all their substaunce great and Cattel that they haue Be ours if we gree thereunto? what can wee further craue? For they wyl styl dwel here with vs, tyl they possesse their graue. 29 Unto this tale that Hamor told and Sichem eke his Sonne, Did al that went out of the Gate agree, it should be done. 30 The Men children were circumcisde according as was sayd, Not one that passed through the Gates, the same thing that denayd. 31 It hapt the thyrd Day after this when they were full of payne, By reason of the foreskynne cut which did great griefe constrayne 32 Two of the Sonnes of Iacob came, the City gate wythin Which Symeon and Leui hight that Dinas brethren bin. 33 And wyth theyr Swordes bothe naked drawne throughout the City went, And slewe the Malekind eu'ry one as they before so ment. 34 They Hamor slewe, and Sichem too, with th' Edge of sword that day, From Sichems house they Dina tooke, And so they went their waye. 35 And then the rest of Iacobs Sonnes, comminge vppon the deede, The Citty spoyl'de, because they had defil'de theyr Fathers Seede: 36 And tooke their Sheepe, and Oxen fat, their Asses as they goe: What else within the Citty was, and in the Fielde also, 37 Theyr goods, their Children, &amp; their Wiues, they Captiue tooke away, And hauoke made of all that was within the house that Day: 38 But Iacob sayd to Simeon, and Leui, Brother his: You haue this Day sore troubled mee, and greatly done amys: 39 You haue also made mee to stinke before them of the Lande, The Cananites, and Pheresites when they this vnderstand: 40 I beinge Fewe, in number Small, not able to resiste, They shal together ioyne themselues and slay me as they list. 41 So shal I be and al my house destroyd for euermore Should hee (sayde they) wyth sister deale, as wyth a common Whore?

Whereby they saulfely came to Luz, in Lande of Canaan. 8 And there an Aulter Builded hee and so did call the place The God of Bethell: for because God of his mighty Grace Did there appeare, sutch time hee fled from Brother Esaus Face. 9 But Deborah, Rebeccas Nourse by Death had such a Stroke, As after Death shee buryed was beneathe vnder an Oke. 10 This Oke did stand beneathe Bethell and they the Oke did cal The Oke of Lamentation to be so knowne of al. 11 And God to Iacob once agayne appeared and did say When from Mesopotamia Iacob was come away 12 God blessed hym and sayd: thy name is Iacob now I see, Thou shalt no more be Iacob cal'd but Isrel named be. 13 God had him grow and multiplye: for I wil make, sayth hee, That People great and mighty Kinges shal growe and sprynge from thee 14 And eke the Land which I did giue to Abraham before And to thy father Isaac and his, for euermore 15 That same Land wil I giue to thee and to thine after Seede So God from Iacob did ascend: and it performde in deede, 16 And in the place where God thus spake Iacob set vp a stone, To be a marke, and powred oyle and drynke offryng theron. 17 And so the place where God thus spake he Bethel did it cal, Whych is to say, the House of God to vnderstand wythall. 18 As they from Bethel traueiled to Euphrata the way, Which signifies the house of Breade, as vnderstand we may: And Bethelem it is also, th' Interpreters do say. 19 When they with in a Field bredth were, then so befel the case, That Rahel beyng great wyth Chylde in painful trauel was. 20 And in the peril of her payne the mydwyfe to her said: This Sonne is thyne, sayd she also therefore be not afraid. 21 Then as her soule departing was and that she nedes must die: The Child with Trauell that she brought, shee named Benoni, 22 Benoni the sonne of sorrow is so to vnderstand: But Iacob cald him Beniamin the Sonne of the right hand. 23 Thus Rahel dyde and buryed was euen in the way they went To Euphrata, or Bethelem, and there wyth good entent 24 Did Iacob set vppon her graue a stone the same to show, Which Rahels Graue stone called is for passers by to know. 25 And Israel departed thence, and pitched vp his Tent Beyond the Tower of Eder whereas to dwel he ment. 26 It chaunced so as Israell now dwelled in the Land. That Ruben, Iacobs eldest Sonne, tooke Bilha by the hand. 27 And lay with her, and knew shee was his Fathers Concubine. The which thing came to Israels eare what Rubin did in fine. 28 Twelue Sonnes in number Iacob had it wel appeareth so, Which in Mesopotamia were borne him all we knowe. 29 So Iacob to his father went to Mamre after this, Which is a Cittie of Arbah and Hebron called is. 30 Where Abraham and Isaac. as straungers did abyde, An Hundreth eightie yeares was hee, when hee fell sicke and dyde. 31 And was his people put vnto, as Custome then did craue, By both his Sonnes which buried him and layd him in his Graue.

Ioseph his Brethren doth accuse, and doth his Dreames them tell. His Brethren hate hym to the Death, and him away do sell. His father wayleth sore his lacke, and thinkes that he is kild, But he for twenty syluer pence was sold in open field. And Iacob dwelled in the Land wherein his Father was A Forreiner in Canaan: and so it came to passe 2 When Ioseph was seuentene yeares old, he kept his Fathers Sheepe, And wyth his Brethren oftentyme did Neate, and Cattell keepe. 3 And thus the Lad with Bilhas Sonnes And Zilphas Sonnes also That Brethren were by Fathers Wiues, (which Handmaydes were you know) 4 I say this Ioseph, was wyth them, and they him hated mutch: In all Thynges that he said or did, agaynst him did they grutch. 5 And spake him euill, and he the same vnto his Father tolde, But Israell lou'd Ioseph more, (because when he was Olde, 6 He hym begat) then all the rest Of Children that he had, And did a partye Coate him make: of Coolours Lyght and Sad. 7 And when his Brethren did perceyue theyr Fathers Loue was more Bent towardes him: then vnto them such Malyce was in store. They could not speake to him in peace, it greeued them so sore 8 And when yonge Ioseph Dreamd a Dream he had delight to tell The same vnto his Brethren all thinking to please them wel. But they in hatred grewe the more, theyr mischief was so fell. 9 Sayd hee, good Brethren lend your Eare, I pray you vnto me, And heare this Dreame which I haue Dreamde, lette so your pleasure be. 10 Behold, me thought we were in Fielde, bynding our sheaues together: Such tyme as men to Haruest goe in season fayre of Wether. 11 And Lo, my Sheafe arose vpright, and stoode vpon the Grounde, Your Sheaues obeisaunce made to mine, in compasse standinge Rounde. 12 Shalt thou then bee our Kynge (sayd they?) or Subiectes thine vs make? And thus they hated him the more, for Dreames, and Woordes hee spake, 13 And yet hee dream'd another dreame, as oft hee did before: And then vnto his Brethren sayd, I haue dream'd one Dreame more, 14 Mee thought I sawe the Sunne, the Moone, and Starres eleuen that be In lowlye sort and humble wise obeysaunce make to me. 15 And he this Dreame his father told, his brethren beynge by, His father then rebuked hym, and sayd vnto him: why? 16 What is this Dream which thou hast dream'd shall I then liue to see, That I, thy Mother, and my sonnes, shal fal on ground to thee? 17 Hys brethren stil did hate him sore, and were to hym vnkynd, But yet his father noted wel this saying in his mind, 18 His brethren then to Sichem went, to kepe theyr fathers sheepe, Said Israel Ioseph vnto, do not thy brethren keepe 19 My sheepe in Sichem, and my store? I wil the send also: Who aunswered, Lo, here am I: his Father said, then goe. 20 And see whether al thinges be well wyth Brethren thyne or no: And whether that the sheepe be wel, come backe again and show. 21 And so be sent him from the Uale of Hebron where he was, And he to Sichem went the way: but so befel the case: 22 A certaine man by chaunce him found: for Ioseph went astraye, And wandred vp and downe the fieldes and myssed on the way, 23 And then the man thus asked him, what sekest thou this Day? I seeke my Brethren, tel me where they sheepe do keepe I pray, 24 They are departed hence (saide he) for thus I heard them say: Let vs now vnto Dothan goe, and none of them sayd nay. 25 Thus Ioseph then them after went, and them in Dothan found: And when they him beheld farre of they stampt theyr feete on ground. 26 And councelled among themselues agaynst yonge Ioseph so, That they would rid hym of his life and kil hym ere they goe. 27 For one vnto another sayd, this Dreamer comes at last: Let vs bereue him of his Life, and in some Pitte him cast. 28 And we will say, a wycked Beast made him a pray to be, Then of his dreames what wil become the sequel we shal see. 29 When Ruben heard what Brethren ment, he Ioseph did conuey, Out from theyr hands, hys Lyfe to saue and thus to them did say. 30 Good Brethren, let vs not him kill ne let vs shede his bloud, But cast hym in the pit that's here if you shal thinke so good. 31 But lay no hand on him sayd he, whereby to do him payne, All this he sayd, Ioseph to ridde to father backe agayne. 32 And so it hapt when Ioseph came his Brethren them amonge, They stript from him his partie Coate and then with thrust and throng 33 They cast him in an emptie Pit wherein no water was: And then they sate them downe to eate their Bread vpon the Grasse. 34 And as they lifted vp their eyes, they did behold and see, Of Ismaelites from Gilead that came, a Companie: 35 With Camels great that loaden were, with Balme, with Myrre, and Spyce: Which going were to Egipt downe, the same to shew for price. 36 And Iudah to his Brethren sayd, what shall it doe vs good Our Brother Ioseph for to kyll and secret keepe his blood? 37 Let vs go sell him to these men that downe to Egipt go, And let vs lay no handes on him, hee is our Flesh, you know: At Iudahs wordes they were cont?t and all agreed did so. 38 And as the Merchauntes passed by, they out from Pyt him drew, And sold him to those Ismaelites whom they before nere knew. 39 For twentie siluer pieces fine young Ioseph haue they bought, And downe to Egipt haue those men this Ioseph safely brought. 40 But when that Ruben came agayne, and look't into the Pytte And found not Ioseph there he left, hee rent his clothes at it. 41 And went agayne his Brethren to, with heauy cheere, and sad. Saying, Ahlas, where shal I go, for yonder's not the Lad. 42 And they consuited with themselues to sley and kyl a Goate, And in the bloud thereof did dyppe their brother Iosephes coate, 43 And sent the same with bloud embrewd their Father for to showe, And sayd, behold, this haue we found, is this thy Sonnes or no? 44 The Coate he knew, and cryde, Ahlas, with teares on face besprent, A wicked Beaste hath kild my Sonne, and him in pieces rent. 45 Then Iacob rent and toare his clothes, and Sackcloth did put on, And gyrded it about his loynes, thinking his Sonne vpon. 46 Thus Iacob sorowed for his Sonne a season very long, His Sonnes and Daughters dyd vp ryse to comfort him among. 47 But he no comfort wold receaue, but sayd: into the Graue Will I goe downe vnto my Sonne, and there my Mourninge haue, There could no counsell him perswade his Cheekes from Teares to saue. 48 In Egipt now was Ioseph soulde to Potiphar by Name: A Lord of Pharaos House was hee, and Stewarde of the same. [Cap. 38.] The Contentes of the XXXVIII. Chap. The Trespas of Er, and eke of Onan, the vengaunce of God that came thereuppon. Iudah wyth Thamar, dyd lye agaynst ryght, Thamar reprou'de hym in euery Mans sight. 1 And at that time went: Iudah downe which Iacobs fourth Sonne was: Leauing his Brethren him behinde, and so it came to passe 2 He turned into one Hirah that was a Dullamyte, Where Shuahs Daughter he espyde who was a Cananite. 3 The which hee tooke vnto his wyfe, no tyme did hee defer, Shee did conceiue and bare a Soune, and he did name him Er. 4 In tyme againe conceyued shee and so a Sonne forth brought And she did Onan call that Childe, which shee so dearely bought. 5 And yet agayne conceiued Shee, and bare another Sonne, Whom shee did Shelah call by name, in Chezib, this was donne. 6 Then Iudah Thamar tooke for wyfe to Er his first borne sonne, Whom God did sley for wickednesse that this same Er had donne. 7 Sayd Iudah to his second Sonne that Onan was to name, Goe thou in to thy brothers wife, and marry thou the same: 8 That thou maist stirre and Scede vp rayse to brother thyne that's gone. But Onan thought wythin hymselfe by her for to rayse none 9 And therefore when to her he wente he did not that he ought: But let it fal vpon the ground and so it came to nought. 10 Which thinge so sore displeased God as made his anger grow, And as his brother he had slaine he killed him also 11 Then Iudah vnto Thamar said, remaine a Widowe still At home within thy fathers house til God hath wrought his wil 12 And tyl that Shelah my yonge sonne a man growne able be. Lest Death do hym preuent also as brethren his, you see. So Thamar to her Fathers house went home and lyued free. In tract of tyme the Daughter of this Suah, Iudas wife By course of yeres fell very sicke and did depart this Lyfe, 14 And when that Iudahs mournyng time was past and ouerrunne He went vnto his sheepe shearers, to see what should be donne. 15 And tooke with him Hirah his frend that of Odollan was, And as they went to Timnah ward it so became to passe, 16 That one to Thamar went, and saide, thy Father now in Law Goes vp to sheere his flockes of sheepe, what I haue said, I sawe. 17 Then Thamar put those garmentes of shee wonted was to weare: Which was such Weede as Widowes vse vppon them for to beare, 18 And with a vayle her selfe bewrept of none for to be knowne, Because shee sawe how Iudahs Sonne, yonge Shelah now was growne, 19 And was not giuen as promisse was her Husband for to be, Shee satte her downe where two Pathes were, that Iudah might her see: 20 And as he passed on the way, he Thamar did espye: Supposing her a common Fylth as by the way doth lye: Shee had her face so couered he could her not descry. 21 And Iudah turned to the way Whereas she was, and sayd, I pray the, let me lye wyth thee, thy payne shalbe well payd. 22 What wylt thou giue me then, said shee, If I to thee agree? I wil a Kid send of the Goates, and gyue the same to thee. 23 If thou wilt leaue with mee a Pledge til thou the same do send, I will accomplish thy request, and show my self thy Frend. 24 What is the Pledge I shall the giue? let me that vnderstand: Thy Sygnet and thy Cloake, sayd she, and Staffe that's in thy Hand. 25 And so he gaue it her to Pledge and shee therewyth content, Wyth her he lay, she then conceiu'de: so home wyth Child shee went, 26 And did put on her Widowes Weede her Uayle aside she layd, And after this did Iudah send a Kid as he had sayd. 27 And Hirah was the messenger, his Neighbour and his frend, And bad hee should the Pledge bringe backe that Shee by him woulde send. 28 But when hee came, hee found her not, the Woman shee was gone. Hee asked of the People by, (Sayd they) wee heard of none. 29 Where is the Whore that sate (sayd hee) here by the hye way side? We saw no Whore sitte here, (sayd they) so backe agayne he hyde. 30 And vnto Iudah came and sayd I can not find her out, The Men of that place also saide, no Whore was there about. 31 Said Iudah then, let her it take lest shame to vs redownde: Behold by the I sent this Kid, and thou hast not her found. 32 When as three Monthes were gone and past, one vnto Iudah said, Behold, thy Daughter Thamar now a Whorish part hath plaid. 33 And wyth the same conceiued is and great wyth Child is she Shee shalbe brent, said Iudah then do bring her forth to me. 34 And after when they brought her forth, shee vnto Iudah sent (That was her Father by the law, who sayd she should be brent) 35 Sayd she, the man to whom these thynges do apertaine by right, By him am I conceyu'd with Child, by powre of natures might. 36 And said also, I pray thee looke, whose these three thinges should be, The Seale, the Cloake and eke the Staffe that here thou seest with mee. 37 Then Iudah knew the Tokens well, and sayd before them al, Shee is far righteous more then I, the deede it selfe proue shal. 38 For shee thys thynge hath donne (sayd he) because Shelah my Sonne, I did not geue to be her fere, as I ought to haue done. And so he neuer knew her more his dayes vnder the Sunne, 39 And when the tyme of Byrth was come she should deliu'red be: Beholde, there was within her Wombe two Twinnes did disagree: 40 For in her Trauell one of them did first his hand put out: The Midwyfe then a redde Threed toke, and bound it round about. 41 Saying, this is the first come forth: but when the Childe pluckt backe His hand agayne into the wombe: his Brother was not slacke, 42 But pressed forth and first was borne whereat the Mydwyfe sayd, What Seperation hast thou made? and she thereat dismayd 43 Sayd, how hast thou broken the Breache vpon thee in such wise? And so he Pharez called was as best them did deuise 44 And after came his Brother forth the Threede about his hand Of colour Red, and he was namde Zarah to vnderstand. [Cap. 39.] The Contentes of the XXXIX. Chapter. God prospreth Ioseph in eche thing, where he a Bondman is: His Maisters VVyfe entiseth him with her to doe amis. By her he falsly is accusde, and into Prison cast: But God his mercy doth extend and settes him free at last. 1 Now Ioseph was to Egypt brought by those that Marchantes were: To one of Egypt they him solde, whose name was Potiphere: 2 This Potipher an Eunuche was, and one of Pharos Lords: And of his House the Steward chiefe and kept the Kinges Recordes. 3 But stil the Lord with Ioseph was so that he prospred wel, For euery thing he tooke in hand did all the Rest excell: Thus in his Maisters house did he continue stil and dwell. 4 Hys mayster the Egyptian did see and vnderstand That God made all thinges prosper wel which Ioseph toke in hand. 5 Did make him Ruler of his House, and gaue him charge of all, And euery one obedient was, and came at Iosephes call. 6 It fortuned from that tyme forth his Maister did him make The cheefest Ruler of his House God blest him for his sake. 7 God blest his House and al he had both in the Field and Towne: His Mayster toke no comptes of him, but walked vp and downe: 8 Saue onely on the Bread hee Eate: such fauoure Ioseph found, And Ioseph was a Goodly Man as went vpon the ground. 9 That in so much his Maysters Wyfe her Eies on Ioseph cast, And did desire the vse of him to lye with her at last. 10 But he refused so to do, and said, Maistrisse, behold, My Mayster left hath in my Handes his Substaunce and his Gold: 11 Him selfe not knowes what he hath put of trust into my Hand: And there is none in fauour more then I, ye vnderstand: 12 Ne yet hath he kept any thyng from me that he doth knoe But onely you, who are his Wife, as reason would it soe. 13 How can I then thus wickedly accomplishe your desire Agaynst my God to do such Synne? do not the same require. 14 Yet notwithstanding Day by Day, she Ioseph stil besought, But he Refused so to doe, and set her speach at nought. 15 And did as much as lay in him her company refrayne Because he would not lye with her nor heare her babling vayne, 16 It hapned on a certayne Day that Ioseph could not chuse But come whereas his Maystris was, he might not then refuse. 17 Because he busynesse had to doe his Maisters House within, And none of al the House was by. saue she that ment to Sinne. 18 She caught his Garment fast in hand and frendly to him sayd I pray thee Ioseph sleape with me, but he the same denayed, 19 And left his Garment in her hand and fled, and got him out: She seyng this, her people calde to come her rounde about. 20 And sayd, behold, my Husband hath an Hebrew hither brought: To doe vs shame and villanye, the Uerlet now hath sought. 21 For he into my Chamber came with me for to haue slept: I Cride aloude as ye haue heard whereat away he leapt. 22 And left his Garment hym behynd the which shee then vp layd, To kepe vntil her Lorde returnde, to whom with Tears she sayd: 23 This Hebrewe which thou hast home broughte came in to do me shame, And sought my honor for to spoyle, and reaue me of my Name. 24 But when I lifted vp my voyce, and Cride that al might heare: He left his garment hym behynde and fled away for feare. 25 His Maister hearyng this of her, beleued al she sayd, And beyng wroth he Ioseph toke and hym in Prison layed. 26 In place where Prisners of the Kinges in Fetters laye fast bound: Thus Ioseph there continued in Prison vnder Grounde. 27 But yet the Lord with Ioseph was and mercy did him show, And got him fauour of the Lorde that did the Pryson owe. 28 And he that keper was therof to Ioseph did c?mit The charge of al the Prisners there to doe as he thought fit. 29 For why, the Keper medled not, but wel did vnderstand That God did prosper eu'ry thing That Ioseph toke in hand. [Cap. 40.] The Contentes of the XL. Chapiter The Butler and the Baker both are into Prison throwne: And ech of them did Dreame a Dreame and Ioseph made it knowne. 1 And after this, it chaunced so that Pharo angry was With Baker his, and Butler eke, whereby it came to passe, 2 That he to Ward committed them where they in Prison lay In that same place where Ioseph was as ye tofore heard say. 3 Thus were the Kinges two Officers in Prison bound with paine, And Ioseph had the charge of them whyle they did there remayne. 4 It happened that both these men in one Night beyng sad In sleepe did Dream, and ech Mans Dreame a sundry meaning had. 5 When Ioseph came as he was wont, in morning them to see, He them beheld wyth heauy cheere, why be ye sad, sayd hee? 6 Wee haue this Night, sayd they to him, Dream'd eche of vs a dreame, And haue no body to declare, what these our Dreames do meane. 7 Do not Interpretyngs belonge, to God, sayd Ioseph than? Yet tell it me: the Buttler first, to shew his Dreame began, 8 And sayd: Me thought before me stoode, a Uyne that Buddes did beare: And in the Uyne were Braunches three, that al bebloomed were. 9 And after Bloomes came Blossoms forth, and Grapes at last did growe: And with my hand those Grapes I tooke, that rype were to the show: 10 And wronge them into Pharos Cuppe, and Wyne therof did make, Me thought I gaue the King the Cuppe, and hee the same did take. Sayd Ioseph then, I wil the same interprete for thy sake. 11 Those Braunches three, are these three Dayes, that with this Day shal fall. In whych the King shal lift the vp, and giue thee therewithall 12 Thyne Offyce that before thou hadst: and thou shalt giue also, The King his Cuppe as thou were wont, and so in fauour grow. 13 But if thou chaunce to thinke on me when thou art in good case, Thy mercy then vppon me showe, abyding in this place. 14 And put the King in mind of me, and bring me out from hence, For in this Dungeon was I cast, not guilty of offence. 15 I am an Hebrew borne by byrth and stolne away was I, And chopt and changde as Bondslaues bee this wretched life to trye. 16 Now when the Baker saw and heard the Butlers Dreame was good, He also vnto Ioseph tolde his Dreame, as he there stoode: 17 Me thought (sayd he) vppon my head three wicker Baskettes were, And in the vppermost of thre was sundry bakte Meates there: And for the Kynge me thought I did these Cates and Baskettes beare. 18 And yet me thought the Byrdes did pecke and stil vpon them fed, And out of Basket did they eate which was vppon my heade. Said Ioseph then: this signifyes thou shortly shalt be Dead: 19 The Baskettes three are dayes yet three that with this Daye shalbe: For this Day three Dayes shall the Kinge take of thy head from thee: 20 And shal thy Carkasse hoyse aloft and hange vpon a Tree, And Byrdes that flye shall eat thy fleshe that we vpon thee see. 21 It hapned that the same thyrde Day was Byrth day of the Kinge, Whereon he feasted all his Men with cheare and Bankettinge. 22 And that same Day he did lift vp the heads of both those twayne The Butler and the Baker eke whiche Prisners did remayne. 23 And so the Butler to his Place hee did eftsones restore: And toke the Bakers Head him froe, his Seruauntes al before. 24 The Butler gaue the King the Cuppe, appoynted to that Place, The Baker hangde as Ioseph sayd, So all things came to passe. But yet the Butler did forget poore Iosephs heauy case. [Cap. 41.] The Contentes of the XLI. Chap. King Pharos Dreames expounded are, by Ioseph, Iacobs Sonne, Chyefe Ruler is he made of all, in Egipt to be donne. And Pharo chaungeth Iosephs name, and gyues a VVyfe to hym. By whom he had two Sonnes: to vvit, Manass' and Ephraim. 1 And two yeeres after it befel, that Pharo Dream'd a Dreame, He thought he stoode a Ryuer by, and sawe come from that Streame 2 Seuen Kyne that fattr and goodly were, Which went before his face, Into a Medow fayre and Greene, wherin they fedde apace. 3 And after them, Seuen other Kyne came vp that Riuer fro, That very Leane and Feeble were, il fauord to the showe. 4 Which stood the other fat Kyne by, vpon the Riuer syde, And these Leane hongerstarued Kyne with bare and pilled Hyde 5 Did eate vp all the wel fed Kyne that nothing did remayne: And Pharo Wak't and fel asleape, and so did Dreame agayne, 6 And in the same him thought to see vpon one stalke to grow, Seauen Eares of Corne both full and large That R?cknes great did show. 7 He sawe come vp Seuen other Eares that sclender were and thynne Be blasted with the Easterne wynd, as Scorched they had bene. 8 And these last Seuen deuoured cleane the goodly Seauen that grew, And Pharo wak'te and look't about t'was but a Dreame, he knewe. 9 But yet when that the Day was come, his spirite was troubled sore, His Seruauntes sent he forth, and sayd, bryng hither me before 10 The Wysemen &amp; the Southsayers that be within the Land: And when they came, the Dreame he Dream'de he made them vnderstand, 11 And what the meaning therof was of them he fayne wold know But none of them Interprete could nor meanyng therof show. 12 The Butler land vnto the King, I call to Mynd this daye, A Breach of promise that I made when I in Prison lay. 13 Such tyme as Pharo angry was and me to Prison sent, And when the Baker of his House a Prisner with me went 24 Thus when we both in Dongeon were, it chaunced in one Nyghte That eche of vs did Dreame a Dreame which after fel out right. 15 There was with vs a fayre Yonge man that was an Hebrew borne, Who Seruaunt to the Marshal was: we nere him saw beforne. 16 To whom we told our seu'rall dreames, and he agayne to vs (As afterward the same fell out) the truth did then discusse. 17 I was restored (as he sayd) to Office myne agayne, And eke the Baker hanged was, as he declared plaine. 18 Then Pharo sent and did commaund this Ioseph for to haue: Forthwyth from Pryson they hym brought out from that filthy Caue. 19 And Ioseph then did shaue himselfe as was that tyme the guyse: And better Clothes did put him on and went in cleanly wise. 20 So when he came the King before, the King to Ioseph spake, I haue (quoth he) late Dream'd a Dreame, but none can truly make, 21 Interpretacion of the same: but yet I haue heard tell, That when a Dreame is told to thee, thou canst declare it well. 22 Then Ioseph to King Pharo said, my Lord the King shall see That God shal geue an Answere good to Pharo without me. 23 Sayd Pharo: in this Dreame mee thought I stode a Riuer by, From wh?ce there came. vii. Goodly Kine wel Fleshed to myne Eye And in a Medowe did they Feede, which was the Riuer ny: 24 And after them I saw come forth out from that running Brooke Seuen other Kyne both Pore and Leane and ill vppon to loke. 25 Such as before I neuer saw within th' Egiptian land, So thynne, so bare, so pin'de away skarce able were to stande. 26 And yet these seuen if fauord Kyne that Staruelynges were and leane, Did Eate vp all the vii. fat Kyne that goodly were and Cleane. 27 And when they had deuoured them, a man could not perceiue That they had Eaten them: for why, their Bellyes stil did cleaue 28 Unto theyr Backes in Starueling sort, as when they did begynne: So Leane were they, so il to see, so pyned, poore and Thinne. 29 I did awake, and Dream'd againe and then me thought I sawe Seuen Eares spring out of good full Corne, vpon one Stalke or Straw. 30 And after them sprang out also vii withred Eares of Corne, So thyn, and blasted with the Wynd, worse Corne was neuer borne. 31 And those vii Eares that withred were and blasted with the Wynde Deuoured vp the Seuen good Eares, and nothing left behynde. 32 This haue I told my Southsayers and Wyse men of my Land: But they hereof can nothing tell ne oughte do vnderstand. 33 Then Ioseph vnto Pharo sayd: both Pharoes Dreames are one: And God doth shew what he wil doe to Pharo euen anone. 34 The Seuen good Kyne do signify Seuen Yeares that happen shal: The seuen good Eares are Yeares also but one Dreame is it all. 35 Lykewyse the Seuen ill fauord Kyne that after them came foorth, That were so Leane, so poore and thynne, appearing nothing worth: 36 Are eke seuen Yeares: the blasted Eares of corne that did appeare Shalbe Seuen Yeres of Dearth so great, as Eare did neuer heare. 37 This is the thing that I haue sayd before my Lord the King, And God to Pharo hath declard what he to passe will bring. 38 Behold Seuen Yeares of Plenty great in all the Land shalbe: And after them agayne shall ryse Seuen Yeeres of Penury. 39 Wherein such Famine shall abound, and bryng the Land in Thrall That those Seuen Yeares of Plenty great shall be forgot of all 40 Thus Famine shal consume the Land that none remember shal The plenty past, by reason of the Honger that shall fal. 41 And where the Dreame the Second time to Pharo doubled was: Behold, God hath establisht it shortly to bring to passe. 42 Now therfore let the Kyng prouide for such a Man as knowes And vnderstandes what Wisdome is: and set him ouer those 43 That do inhabite in the Lande, to beare the rule and sway And vnder hym such Officers as may in tyme puruay. 44 And let them take the fyft part vp of Foode through out the Land That shal in those Seuen plenteous Yeeres, fall in th' Egiptians Hande. 45 And let the same and Corne also that they shal then prouyde Be vnder th' hand of Pharo brought, the same to lay asyde. 46 And that there may in Citties all be stoare of Foode to serue Agaynst the tyme of Hunger come, that People may not sterue. 47 And that the Land not peryshe may, through Hunger that shal growe, This saying pleased Pharo well, and Seruauntes his also. 48 And Pharo sayd his Seruaunts to, who then were hym beside: Where shall we fynd a Man lyke this, in whom Gods Sprite doth byde? 49 And Pharo vnto Ioseph sayd, for so much as I see, That God hath shew'd these thynges to the, which thou hast told to mee: There is no Man that wisdome hath, nor Knowledge like to thee. 50 Thou shalt therefore ouer my House, beare all the Rule and swaye, And what thou speakste, my People shall in euery thing obay. 51 Onely I will aboue thee bee, in Kingly Seate and Throne, But otherwise, thou Gouerne shall and Rule the rest alone. 52 And sayd, behold, I haue thee sette to Rule ouer the Land: So tooke his Rynge his Fynger from, and put on Iosephs hand 53 And hym arayd in Cloth of Raines as Princes wont to weare Lykewyse about his necke he put a chayne of Gold to beare 54 And set him vp aloft to Ryde a Charret rych vpon: Which was of all that Pharo had the best, excepting one. 55 And as he rode, they cryde before to Ioseph bowe the Knee Thus Pharo made him Gouernour of Egipt Land to bee. 56 Sayd Pharo then, I Pharo am, but yet this vnderstand, Without thee shal no Subiect myne lift vp his Foote or Hand. 57 And Pharo called Iosephs name in Hebrew as wee fynde, Zaphnath Paaneah: that's to say, the Opener of the Mind. 58 He gaue Asenath to his Wyfe to feede his ioyes vpon The Daughter of Potipberah the Prince or Preest of On. 59 Then Ioseph did prepare him selfe the Land to goe about There was no peece of Egypt Land, that Ioseph sought not out. 60 And Thirty Yeares was he of Age when he before the Kyng Did stand in grace, and had the charge to gouerne euery thyng. 61 Thus from the presence of the Kynge did Ioseph now departe, And went the Land of Egipt through with humble Sprite and hart, 62 And in those seuen yeares plentiful late spoken of before, The Earth of Corne, and sundry grayne, brought foorth abundaunt store. 63 And Ioseph gathered all the Foode, that those seuen yeares did yeld, And looke what Cittie lay most neere the foode of any field: 64 Within the same it was layd vp, vnto the Off'cers hand, This was the Order that hee kept through all th' Egiptian Land, 65 The wheate that Ioseph vp had layd, to serue in tyme of neede, For multitude was lyke the Sand: it nomber did exceede. 66 And ere the yeares of hunger came, Ioseph had two Sonnes borne, By Asenah his wyfe that was, of whom wee heard beforne. 67 And hee the first of those two Sonnes, Manasseth did he call, For God (sayd hee) made mee forget my Fathers Houshold all. 68 And Ephraim did Ioseph call, his other second Sonne: God hath me fruitful made, sayd hee, in mine affliction. 69 And when the seuen yeares plentiful were ended with their store, Then came the seuen yeeres Famin foorth, as Ioseph sayd before. 70 Though Famine fel in al the Landes, yet Egipt Land was free, For when the rest of Honger dyed. yet Foode was there to see. 71 And after this the Hunger came, into th' Egiptian Land, And then the people gan to crye for bread at Pharaos hand. 72 Sayd Pharao then, to Ioseph go and what he sayth to you, The same perfourme, and you shal see great goodnesse shall ensue. 73 The Dearth was great throughout the Land, and Ioseph went apace To eu'ry Towne where store was kept, and sold in eu'ry place. 74 All Countries els, to Egipt came of Ioseph Corne to buye, The Famin was so great abrode, the want made manye dye. [Cap. 42.] The Contentes of the XLII. Chapter. To Egipte Iosephs Brethren come, some Vytayle for to buye, And Ioseph knowes them very well, and doth his Brethren trye. And Simeon in Hold is put in Pryson of the king, Tyl they vnto their Father goe, young Beniamin to bring: His Father's loath to let him goe, because hee lou'de him best: But at the last contented is and grauntes to their request. 1 And Iacob saw that there was Corne in Egipt to bee had: Sayd to his Sonnes, why gape ye one an other on, so sad? In Egipt there is Corne I heare, therfore let vs be glad. 2 Now get you downe and thyther goe, some Corne from thence to buye, That wee therewith may feede and lyue, and not through Hunger die. 3 So went the Sonnes of Iacob downe, which Tenne in number were, And Brethren all by fathers syde to Ioseph that was there. 4 But Beniamin who Brother was, to Ioseph in whole Bloud, Their father would not let him goe, but kept him backe for good: 5 Least some Misfortune might him hap, (as hee of Ioseph thought) And so the Tenne, to Egipt went and Corne for Many, sought. 6 And thus among the preasse they past, with Monie in their hand, For yet the Dearth was very great, throughout all Canaan Land. 7 Now Ioseph beeing Gouernour deliu'red with his hande The Corne, and sold to all that came, inhabiting the Land. 8 Among the which, his Brethren came and fell before his face Downe flat vpon the Ground they lay, and him besought of Grace. 9 When Ioseph had his Brethren spyde, he knew them wel ynough, And made him selfe al straunge to them, and spake in woordes ful rough: 10 From whence come you? they aunswered from Land of Canaan: To buye some vytayle for our Coyne in humblest wyse we can. And al this whyle they knew him not from any other man. 11 Now, Ioseph to remembraunce cald, the Dreame he dreamde of them, Which hee them told ere he was sold, vnto the Marchaunt men. 12 And sayd, you are but Spies I know, which hither make Resort, To see where as the Land is weake the same for to report. 13 Not so my Lord, wee come, sayd they, some Uittal for to buye, We meane but troth and are no Spies, as deede it selfe shall trye: And are the Sonnes of one man all: this Troth is, and no lye. 14 Sayd hee, I know you are but Spies what ere you beare in hand, And hyther are you come to see the weakenesse of the Land. 15 Sayd they, thy Seruauntes Brethren be twelue, gotten by one man. And he our Father doth remayne in Land of Canaan. 16 Our yongest Brother Beniamin, wyth him doth byde this Day, And Ioseph that our brother was is dead out of the way. 17 Sayd Ioseph then to them againe, this makes me doubt you more, To be but Spies vppon the Land, as I haue sayd before. 18 And hereby shal I proue you true or false in that you say, Now here I swere by Pharos lyfe you shall not goe away: 19 Except your youngest Brother come whom Beniamin you call, Therefore send one who may him fetch and come hymself wythal: 20 And you in pryson shalbe kept to proue this truth or lies, Elles by the Lyfe of Pharao King, I take you al as Spies. 21 And so he put them all in Ward, wherein three Dayes they lay, Then Ioseph came to them agayne and on this wise did saye. 22 This do and Liue, for I feare God, and will not ly to you, If you be Men that of your wordes, wil Iust be found and true. 23 Let one of you in pryson House be bound for all the rest: The other Nyne shall victuall haue, to carry of the best. 24 Least Famine fall your Houses in: but bringe you vnto mee Your younger Brother: that your wordes may true appeare to bee, And that you dye not through the same: and so they did agree: 25 One Brother to another sayd, our Sinne was very great, That wee gainst Brother Ioseph did, when hee did vs intreat. 26 Yea, in the Anguishe of his Soule hee gently vs besought, And wee would not regard his Wordes, but set the same at nought. And therefore are these troubles great. vppon vs iustly brought. 27 Sayd Ruben then, did I not say, and warninge geue of this, Wee should not sinne against the Child least thinges should hap amisse? You would not heare, and now behold, his Bloud required is. 28 They thought that Ioseph had not knowne, or vnderstood their Tongue, For that by an Interpreter, hee spake to them amonge. 29 When Ioseph heard what moane they made hee turn'd aside, and wept. And by and by with them did talke, and still his Count'naunce kept: 30 And Simeon hee tooke from them, and bound him for the rest: And so before his Brethrens Eyes was made a Prison Ghest. 31 Then Ioseph did commaund to fill their Sackes with Corne good store. And that their Money should bee tyed within their Sackes before. 32 Also he willed they should haue some Uyctaile for to spende. As Homeward they should passe the way, vnto their Iourneys ende. 33 And thus did hee: and they it toke, with show of thankful hart, Theyr Asses did they Lade with Corne, and did from thence depart. 34 And in their Trauell as they went, an Inne they came vnto, Where one of them went to his Sacke, the same for to vndoe: 35 To giue his Asse some Prouender, and when hee it vnbound, Behold, within the Mouth therof, his Money all he found. 36 And he vnto his Brethren sayd, I haue vndone my sacke, And loe, my Money is therein, to me restored backe. 37 Theyr hartes began to faint with feare, and were astonied sore, And one of them to other sayd, alas, alas, wherfore Hath God our God thus delt wyth vs, to make our sorrowes more? 38 At length theyr Father Iacobs House, by Trauell great they wan, Who did Expect theyr c?ming longe, in Land of Canaan. 39 To whome they told eche thing that hapt, and sayd vnto him thus: The Lord himselfe that's of the Land, did roughly speake to vs. 40 Who sayd we came as Spyalls there his Country to betray, We are no Spyes but truly meane, did we to him then say. 41 And are in nomber Brethren twelue the Children of one man, One is away: the yongest is, at home in Canaan. 42 The Lord agayne then sayd to vs, hereby I shall wel knowe, Whether you meane as you haue sayd, or Spyalls be or no. 43 You shall leaue one of you behynd, for to abyde with me, The rest shall take of foode enough, for Housholds yours that bee. 44 And if you brynge the Yongest Sonne, that Brother is to you, I shall then thinke you meane but well and all your sayinges true. 45 And so wil I deliuer you, your Brother backe agayne, And you shal occupy the Land, wherein you do remayne. 46 And as they emptied al theyr Sackes, theyr Father beyng by, Ech one of them his Money found, wythin his sacke to lye. 47 The sight whereof made Children all, and Father theirs afraid. That in so much the Aged man, vnto his Children sayd, 48 You haue me robd of Children twayne: for Ioseph he is gone, And Simeon the Lord doth know, what hym is falne vpon. 39 If Beniamin you take away, the youngest of you all, I doe foresee the sorowes great, against mee that shall fall. 50 Then Ruben to his Father sayd, I haue two Sonnes you see, Slay them, if that I bring not backe, this Beniamin to thee. 51 Deliuer him into my hand, the charge of him to take: And if I bring him not agayne, my twayne kyll for his sake. 52 Sayd Iacob then, my Sonne shall not that way with you downe goe: His Brother Ioseph's dead, and hee is left alone, you know. 53 If some misfortune should him hap, the waye you would him haue: My hoarye hayres you shal then bring with sorow to my Graue. [Cap. 43.] The Contentes of the XLIII. Chap. VVhen as young Beniamin was brought, with Giftes returned they, And Simeon deliu'red is, from Prison where he lay, And Ioseph turnes asyde to weepe, that they might not him see. They eate, and drinke, and mery are together, as may bee. 1 When Iacob and his Children had consumed all their store, Hee bade his Sonnes to Egipt goe to buye a little more. For why, the Dearth was in the L?d, among them verye sore: 2 Then Iudah to his Father sayd, Ahlas, what shal ensue? The man did charge vs by an Othe the which we all shall rue. 3 Except (sayth hee) you hyther bring your Brother to this place, I charge you that you do not come nor see mee in the face. 4 If thou therfore wilt send with vs our Brother for to goe, Wee wil goe downe, and buy thee Foode, and bring ynough wee knowe. 5 But if thou wilt not send him downe wee will not go at all: The man for Spialls wil vs take and therby make vs thrall. 6 For thus, sayd hee, vnlesse you bring your younger Brother heere: I charge you that before my face, you come not to appeere. 7 Sayd Israel, wherfore delt yee so cruelly with mee, As for to tel the man, you had a Brother yet to see? 8 The man did aske to vs (sayd they) and streightly did enquire, What Race our stocke, and kinred was, and asking did desire, 9 Is not your Father yet aliue? and haue ye not (sayd hee) Another Brother, left at home? it is euen so: sayd wee: 10 Could wee then know or vnderstand, that hee to vs would say, I charge you bring your brother downe, to come with you the way? 11 Then Iudah to his Father sayd, Send yee the Lad with mee, That wee may ryse and goe for Foode. and bring the same to thee. 12 That thou, our Children, and our selues, thereby our liues may saue: And not to dye through want of Foode, where wee the same may haue, 13 I wil be Surety for the Lad to bring him safe againe, Thou shalt require him at my hand to see him on my payne. 14 And if I bring him not againe, as I haue sayd before, And that thine eyes shall him behold, blame mee for euermore. 15 Trulye if that wee had not stayd so long where no cause is We had bene there the second tyme and come agayne ere this. 16 Then sayde their Father vnto them, if it must needes bee so: You shal this doe at my request, before that you doe goe. 17 Within your Uessels shall ye put the best fruites in the Land, And bring a Present of the same and geeue it in his hand. 18 Of Balme, of Honye, and of Spyce, of Myrre, and Nuttes also: Of Almondes sweete, of ech a parte, that in our Land doth grow. 19 And double Money shal you take within your hand to beare, And eke the Money that you brought backe in your Sackes, that's heere. 20 The same shall you take backe agayne, and therein doe but right. For why, perhaps, among themselues it was some ouersight. 21 Aryse and take young Beniamin vnto the man also, And God Almightie blesse you all, the waye wherein you goe. 22 God graunt you mercie in the sight of hym you goe vnto: That hee may geeue your Brother backe as hee sayd, hee would doe. 23 And that hee may deliuer you my Beniamin agayne: Lest I bee robbed of my Chyld vnto my griefe and payne. As I of Brother his haue bene, whom Sauage beastes haue slaine. 24 Thus with the Present and the Coygne, wyth Beniamin likewise, They rose and went to Egipt down, and stode before the Eyes 25 Of Ioseph, whom when he had spyde, he to his Ruler saide, Bring these Men home into my house and let them there be stai'd, 26 Untill I come and Cates prepare, for they shal Dyne with me. And so eche thing by him was donne, as Ioseph bade to be. 27 But when they were in Iosephs house, then were they all afraid, Amonge themselues they gan to scanne, and one to other said. 28 How that the Mony was the cause, that they were thither brought: Which in theyr Sackes they caried home, with Corne that they had bought, 29 And now will he a quarell picke, and to our charge wil laye Some thing: whereby in Bondage vs, and Asses ours to staye. 30 And therefore came they to the man, that thither did them brynge, And at the Dore of Iosephs House, did tell him eu'ry thing. 31 O sir (Sayd they) we hyther came at first some Foode to buye, And as we came into an Inne, of purpose there to lye. 32 Wee eu'ry one his Sacke vndid, for thinges that seem'de to lacke, And eache of vs his Money found, full weight within his Sacke. 33 And wee haue brought it backe agayne, for so we thought it good, And other Money in our handes besydes, to buy vs Foode. Wee knowe not who our Money put in Sackes where as they stoode. 34 Peace bee to you then, sayd the Man, and nothinge feare at all, For why? your God hath holpen you, which neuer fayle you shall: 35 And eke the God, of Father youres, th' Almighty God was hee, That put the Money in your Sackes, for once it was with mee. 36 And then hee brought out Simeon their Brother left behinde, For Pledge of their Returninge backe, as Ioseph had assignd: 37 And so together were they led by Iosephs Offycer, Who Water gaue, theyr Feete to washe, and fetched Prouender 38 For Asses theirs, that hungry were, and weary by the way, And they thus and their Asses too in Ioseps House did stay: 39 Where as the Brethren redy made sutch Presentes as they had, Agaynst that Ioseph should come home: and now they waxed glade 40 Because they heard they should at Noone eate Breade in Iosephs sight, And thinkinge on the Off'cers wordes them Ioyfull made, and Light. 41 Now when that Ioseph Home was come, ech one with Giftes in Hand, Fell flat on Ground with Presentes sutch as Grewe in Canan Lande, And him Presented therewithall, in Place where hee did stande: 42 In curteous wise, he welcom'de them: is Father yours (sayd hee) Yet still aliue? and in good Health? as you before toulde mee? 43 Our Father Sir, and Seruaunt thyne, is in good Health wee knowe, And therewithall did bow themselues, obedience theirs to showe. 44 Then Ioseph liftinge vp his Eyes, Younge Beniamin espied: That Brother vnto Ioseph was, by right of Mother side. 45 Sayd he, is this younge Beniamin? of whom you spake before? My Sonne to thee God Mercy shew, (sayd hee) for euermore. 46 And Ioseph hasted him away, his Teares began to fall: His Hart vppon younge Beniamin did Yerne, and melt withall: 47 So hee vnto his Chamber went, that none might him espye, And there a space did Weepe, and shed forth Teares aboundauntly. The numbering of stanzas in the source document has been followed. 68 And afterward he washt his Face: and came out fresh to see, He dyd refrayne and straynd hymselfe, as it had not ben hee: And dyd commaunde vpon the Borde, that Breade there set should be. 69 And they prepard for him alone, his Dignity to show, And for his Brethren by themselues, and for the Egiptians soe, Which eat wyth Ioseph, by themselues: for vnderstand and know 70 Th' Egiptians doe it accompte, abhomynation great, If wyth the Hebrues any tyme, they happen Bread to eate. 71 These Brethren sate Ioseph agaynst. the Eldest in degree: The Yongest placed to his youthe, the Lowest set was he. And much the Men among themselues did maruell this to see. 72 And there were brought them sondry Meates, that Ioseph stode before, But Beniamin had, with the rest, so much and fyue times more. 73 And thus they sate, and mery were, and had ynough of Wyne, They Dranke with him euen of the best, that strongest was and fine, [Cap. 44.] The Contents of the XLIIII. Chap. Ioseph accuseth Beniamin of Theft, whereat they mourne: And Iudah is a Pledge become for Beniamins retourne. 1 And afterwarde commaunded hee and sayd his Steward to, Go fyll theyr Sackes with Corne and graine as I appoint you, doe. 2 And put both Corne and Foode therein, asmuch as they can beare, And in the mouth of ech mans Sacke, close vp their Monie there. 3 But in the Sacke of Beniamin, that youngest is of all, My Cuppe, I meane my Siluer Cuppe, there put the same thou shal. 4 His Corne, and Coyne, he hyther brought, likewise the same put in, And so the Steward did in all, as hee commaunded him. 5 And in the morning when the Sunne began abroade to show, The men were sent away from th?ce, and Asses theirs also. 6 And when they were the Cittie out, and not farre gone away, His Steward then commaunded hee to folow them, and saye: 7 Wherfore haue you rewarded ill for good that's done to you? And for great Curtesye receiu'de to shew your selues vntrue? 8 Is not the Cuppe wherein my Lord doth drinke and Prophecie, Conueighde away by one of you? you haue done naughtelye. 9 And so the Steward passed foorth and when hee them oretooke, He spake those Wordes as Ioseph had, whereat for feare they shooke. 10 And sayd, Ah las, why doth my Lord declare such wordes as these? God it forbyd wee should ought doe that might thy Lord displease. 11 Behold the Money which we found within our Sackes to bee, We brought agayne from Canaan, and gaue it vnto thee. 12 How then should wee from thy Lordes house, steale Syluer, Plate, or Gold: With whom so euer it is found, let him bee had in Hold. 13 And let him dye, and wee also will further promise make, Bondmen to bee vnto my Lord for his offences sake. 14 Now then sayd he, it shall so bee as you haue sayd to mee: Hee vpon whom the thinge is found, shall now my Seruaunt be. 15 And you be blamelesse of the Cryme, and Innocentes abyde, And euerye man his Sacke tooke downe and it, did open wyde. 16 And at the Eldest they began to make this Search: and so From one to one, in their degree, did search their Sackes a rowe. 17 And at young Beniamin they left, within whose Sacke they had The siluer Cup, that missing was, which made them all so sad. 18 That they their Clothes be rent and tare and euerye one tooke payne, To Lade his Asse, and to the towne returned backe agayne. 19 So Iudah and his Brethren came to Ioseph, whom they found At home in house, where they him left, and fell vpon the Ground. 20 What Act is this sayd (Ioseph then), that you haue done to mee? Do you not know such one as I can truly Prophecie? 21 Said Iudah then, what shal wee say vnto my Lord as now? What shall wee speake? to cleare our selues Ahlas, wee know not how. 22 The wickednesse of seruauntes thyne the Lord hath now made plaine, And wee thy Bondmen are become, foreuer to remayne. Both wee, &amp; he, with whom the Cuppe was found vnto our payne. 23 Not so (sayd Ioseph) God forbyd you should such dealing see, But hee wyth whom the Cuppe is Founde Shall Seruaunt bee with mee And you haue leaue in peace to goe, vnto your Father free. 24 Then Iudah drew more neere to him, and sayd, O Lorde I pray, Geeue leaue that I in my Lordes Eares, a Worde or two might saye. 25 And let not Lord, thy wrath be mooude against mee for the same: For thou art euen as Pharao is, in Dignitie and Name. 26 My Lord a question did demaund of vs thy Seruauntes here, Haue you a father, yea or no, or els a Brother deare? 27 We haue a Father that is Old, vnto my Lord, sayd wee: And a young Lad which hee begat, the youngest Sonne is hee. 28 In his old Age hee him begat, when hoarye was his head, His Father loues him passing well: his Brother now is dead. 29 And he alone of Mother his is left with him to bee, Then thou vnto thy Seruaunts said: do bring him vnto mee. 30 That I may also set mine Eye, vpon this Lad to see, And then againe vnto my Lorde in this wise aunswerd wee. 31 The Childe, Ahlas, cannot depart, his louinge father fro: For if he should, his father then would Dye with Griefe and woe. 32 Thou saydst agayne: except you brynge your Yonger Brother downe, I charge you see my face no more, in Country, Field, or Towne. 33 So to our Father when we came, that nowe thy Seruaunt is, And shew'd him what my Lorde had sayde, would not agree to this. 34 At last our Father sayd to vs, goe downe againe you shall, And buy for vs a little Foode, that we may liue withal. 35 We answered, we cannot goe, vnlesse you graunt this thing, Our yonger Brother be with vs, before my Lord to bryng. 36 For we may not the man behold, except our Brother goe. Our Father sayde: Rahell, my Wife, bare me two Sonnes, you know 37 And one of them went out from me: and I for troth did say, My Sonne in peeces smal is torne, as hee went by the way, And I did neuer see him since, the tyme he went astraye. 38 Now if you take this Sonne from me, and Death lykewise him haue: Then shal you bringe my hoary head with sorrow to the Graue. 39 Now therefore when I shall come to my Father and thy Thrall, And that the Childe bee not with vs amonge his Children all: 40 Seinge his life dependes vppon the Life of this younge Lad, When hee shall see the Child not come, will pensiue bee, and Sad. 41 And dye hee will for Sorrowe sure, so shall thy Seruauntes bringe Our Fathers Head vnto the Graue: ah las wee wayle the thinge. 42 Doubtlesse, thy Seruaunt Pledge became vnto my Father deare: And sayd, if that I bringe him not, the blame then will I beare. 43 Therefore I pray, let mee abide, a Seruaunt thine to bee: And let the Child with Brethren goe, our Father for to see: 44 For how can I goe vp with them, my Father to beeholde, If that the Childe be not with mee? vnlesse that see I woulde, The Sorrowes great, on Father mine. ah las that happen shoulde. [Cap. 45.] The Contentes of the XLV. Chapiter. Howe Ioseph makes hym selfe well knowne vnto his Brethren all, And doth embrace Younge Beniamin wyth weepinge teares that fall. Hee sendeth for his Father deare wyth Horse, and Charettes fit. The olde Man doth beholde the same, reioysinge mutch at it. 1 Ioseph could not him self refrain before them that stoode by: But cride away w? eu'ry man, let none but these be ny. 2 And euery Man departed th?ce not one was left behinde: Saue these his Brethren vnto whom, Ioseph disclos'de his Minde. 3 And Ioseph Wept, and cride so loud, vnto his Brethren tho: As the Egiptians heard him cry, and Pharos house also. 4 Ioseph I am (Brethren sayd he), doth yet my Father liue? His Presence so abashed them, they could no aunswer giue. 5 Goed Brethren myne (sayd Ioseph then,) come neere I pray, to me: And they came neere astonished, and wondred hym to see. 6 I am that Ioseph brother yours, that you to Egipt sold, Now therefore be not sad for it, but merry be and bold. 7 For God before you did me send, into this Land I knowe, For your good Preseruation, and Lyues of many moe: 8 For now two Yeres of Famyn great, haue ben throughout the Land, And fyue Yeres more are yet behind, I gyue you t'vnderstande, 9 Wherein shal neither Earyng be, nor Haruest wyth encrease, Untyll seuen Yeres accomplisht be, this Famyn shal not cease. 10 Wherfore God hath sent me before, in this same Land to be, You to Preserue, and keepe aliue, and your Posterity. And by a great deliuerance, your Liues haue kept, you see. 11 Now then you hither sent me not, but God who doth foreknow, Of thinges to come, who hath me made, a Father to Pharo. 12 And made me Lord of all his House, and ruler through the Land: Make hast therefore to Father myne, and let him vnderstand, 13 And tell him thus: thy Sonne doth say, who Ioseph is by name, God hath me made of Egipt Land, Lord ouer al the same. 14 Come downe to me and tarry not and thou with me shalt Dwell In Goshen Land and be neere mee, And al thinges shall be wel. 15 Thou and thy Children, here shall dwell, and Childers Children thine, Thy sheepe, thy Beastes and al thou hast, bryng it away in tyme. 16 Also I wil thee nourish there: for yet Fyue yeares remain Of Dearth: make hast lest thou and thyne, doe sterue with pyning payne. 17 And loe, beholde your eyes do see, and Beniamin likewise, (Who onely Brother is to mee) doth see before his Eyes: 18 It is my Mouth that speakes to you Expounder haue I none And in such Language doe I speake, as is to you best knowne. 19 And therefore do my Father tell, what Honor I possesse, And eache thing elles that you haue seene, the same to him expresse. 20 Then fell he on his Brothers Necke, wyth Teares out from his Eies, And Beniamin fell on his Necke. and Wept on him likewise. 21 And Ioseph all his Brethren kyste, and Wept on them also, And afterward they spake with him, as Brethren ought to doe. 22 The Uoyce or Tydinges of the same, in Pharos House dyd fall, Iosephs Brethren are come (sayd they) thus Range it through the Hal. It pleased Pharo very well, and eke his Seruauntes all. 23 Then vnto Ioseph, Pharo sayd, this to thy Brethren say: Goe, Lade your Beastes and so depart, to Canaan the waye. 24 Your Father take, and Household all and come agayn to mee: I will you geue of Egipt Lande the best your Eye may see: And you shall eate the Chiefest Fruictes, within the Land that bee. 25 And I commaund thee thus to do: from hence you Charettes take. For Children yours, and for your Wiues, and for your Father sake. With speede go bringe your Father here, that wee may merry make. 26 As for your Uessels and your stuffe, set not your eye theron, The best of all that's in the Land, is yours to byde vpon. 27 His Brethren did as he them bad, and Ioseph to them gaue, Of Chariottes fayre as Pharo had commaunded them to haue, And for their Iourney victail gaue, theyr Life and soule to saue, 28 He gaue to euery Brother there, excepting neuer a one, Chaunge of Apparell for to weare, theyr bodyes them vppon. 29 But vnto Beiamin he gaue three hundreth Peeces fayre Of Syluer fyne, and eke fyue sutes, of rayment for to weare, 30 And Ioseph to his Father sent, of Female Asses tenne, Well Laden all with chiefest things, that Egipt yeldes to menne, 31 Tenne Asses more he Laden sent, wyth Wheat, with Bread, and Meate, For his good Father by the way, thereon to Feede and eate. And fall not out, sayd Ioseph then, each other well intreate, 32 From Egipt thus they passed thence, to Canaan the way: Where they their Father Iacob found, to whom they thus did say: 33 Our Brother Ioseph is aliue, wee lette you vnderstand, And he it is that gouernes al, and Rules th' Egiptian Land. 34 The hearing of these wordes in deede, made Iacobs hart to fall, As one that stoode twene hoope and Dread, beleu'de them not at all. 35 They further told, by Circumstance, as Ioseph had them say: But Iacob yet amazed was, and stoode in doubtfull staye. 36 But when he saw the Charriottes fayre, that Ioseph had him sent, His body easlye for to beare: it dyd him mutch content. 37 And then his Sprite reuiued fast, and sayd, ynough I haue That Ioseph liues: I will him see, ere I possesse my Graue. [Cap. 46.] The Contentes of the XLVI. Chap. Heere Iacob with his Houshold all, to Egipte goes apace, And Ioseph meetes him by the waye, wyth Teares alonge their Face. 1 And Israell his Iourney tooke with all the goods bee had, And vnto Berseba went hee, with mery heart, and glad: 2 And offred Offringes to the God of Isack Father hys. And God by Night in Uision spake to Isrell: sayinge thus: 3 Iacob, Iacob: Who aunswered, behold Lord, heere I am: Sayd God: I am thy Fathers God, with thee that hither cam. 4 Feare not to Egipt downe to passe. for I wil with thee goe. I will thee there a People make, in Number greate to growe. 5 And also will thee bringe againe: and Ioseph shall likewise Put downe his Hand, when thou shalt dye, alonge vppon thine Eyes. 6 Then Iacob rose from Berseba, hee list no longer staye: His Sonnes their Father carry did, in Charryot for to lay. 7 Lykewise their Children, and themselues, and Wiues were redy bent To goe into the Chariottes sutch, as Pharo for them sent. 8 And so theyr Cattell and theyr goods, they gatte in Canan Lande, Wyth them they brought to Egipt Soyle, by Gods Almighty Hand. 9 I say both Iacob and his Seede, came altogether than, Hys Sonnes and his Sonnes Sonnes wyth him, from Land of Canaan. 10 Hys Daughters and the Daughters such, as his Sonnes gotten had, And all his Seede brought hee with him to Egipt very glad. These are the names of Iacobs Lygne, whom Israell we call, Whych into Egipt came with him, in order as they fall. Not reproduced here is a diagrammatical representation of Jacob's genealogy with Leah. These be the Sonnes to Iacob borne by Leah his fyrst wife, Beside fayre Dina Daughter his, for whome there fel great strife. These are the Sonnes, from Rahel that did fall To Iacob borne, were fourtene Sonnes in all. Not reproduced here is a diagrammatical representation of Jacob's genealogy with Rachel.The Soules with Iacob, that downe went to Egipt on the way, Were in the whole Sixtie and Sixe, as wel perceiue you may, Besides the wiues of Iacobs Sonnes, of whom wee nothing saye. Two Sonnes in Egipt Ioseph had that borne were vnto him, Manasseh was the first of twaine, the younger Ephraim. And these the Sonnes of Bilha were, whom Laban, as is sayd, Did geeue to Rahel Daughter his, to be her waighting Mayde. Not reproduced here is a diagrammatical representation of Jacob's genealogy with Bilhah.So all the Soules of Iacobs House, which into Egipt past, In number are three Skore and Tenne, from first vnto the last. 11 Then Iacob, Iudah sent before to Ioseph in the way, Hym to direct to Goshen Land where in they made their stay, 12 Then Ioseph readye made himselfe, his Chariot eke also, And vp to Goshen Land hee went, his Father for to know. 13 To whom hee did himselfe present. and on his Necke did fall, Whereon hee wept a good long space to comfort of them all. 14 Then Israel to Ioseph sayd, now let my lyfe depart, Sith I haue lyu'de thy Face to see, and that alyue thou art. 15 Then Ioseph to his Brethren sayd, and fathers Houshold all. I will goe vp and Pharao showe, and tel him what's befall. 16 How Father mine, and Brethren eke, with Housholdes all that bee, Are come from Land of Canaan, to Goshen me, to see. 17 And that the Men but Shepeheardes are, and for because of that, Their Sheepe and Cattel haue they brought and al what euer what. 18 And if that Pharao call to you, and aske of you and saye, What is the trade that you do vse, or how spend you the Daye? 19 Then shal you say: thy Seruauntes are, as Fathers them beforne. In tending Cattel occupied, since tyme that we were borne. 20 That ye may dwel in Goshen Land: for eu'rye Shepeheard is Among th' Egiptians hated much, as men that doe amisse. [Cap. 47.] The Contentes of the XLVII. Chap. Iacob before the King is come, and Pharao doth him giue Leaue for to dwel in Goshen Land, all Dayes that hee shall lyue. And Iacob maketh Ioseph sweare, with hand vnder his Thye, VVhen hee is dead, to burye him, where as his Fathers lye. 1 Then Ioseph came, and Pharao tolde, my Father now from far And Brethren myne, their shepe haue brought and now in Goshen are 2 And to the?ntent? the king might see, what kynde of Men they were, Ioseph presented to the King Fyue of his Brethren there. 3 Then Pharao did demaund of them, What is your trade? (sayd hee) Thy Seruauntes, Shepeheardes are, sayd they, as Fathers our haue bee. And for to soiourne in the Lande is cause we come to thee. 4 For Seruauntes thyne, no pasture haue to keepe our Sheepe withall, So sore the Famyn in the Land of Canaan is fall. 5 And therefore now wee humbly pray, thou suffer vs to Dwell, In Goshen Land where by thy Leaue, wee hope for to Liue well. 6 Then Pharo vnto Ioseph said. I vnderstand and see, Thy Father and thy Brethren are, come hither vnto thee. 7 Behold the Land of Egipt lyes all ope before thy Face And in the best part of the same, do thou therein them place. 8 In Goshen Land let them remaine, and Soiourne there and Dwell: And if amonge thy Brethren be, in prowesse that excel: 9 Let them be Rulers likewise made, ouer my Flockes of Sheepe, And other Cattel that is myne, in safety them to keepe. 10 Then Ioseph vnto Pharo broughte olde Iacob Father his, And Iacob there saluted him, and did him also Blisse. 11 What be the Number of thy Yeares? sayd Pharo to hym then, Sayth hee, my tyme of Pilgrimage is sixe Skore Yeres and Ten. 12 Few be the Dayes that I haue liu'de. and also very bad: And I haue not those yeres attaind, that my Forefathers had. 13 And Iacob then did Pharo blesse and did depart him fro, And Ioseph with his Father went, and left the king also. 14 His Father and his Brethren all, hee placed out of hand, And gaue them Ground for to possesse, in best parte of the Land. 15 Euen in the Land of Rameses, as earst the King did say, Of Goshen which a Cittie was, where Pharoes Treasure laye. 16 And Ioseph did prouision make of Bread wherewith to feede His Father, and his Houshold all, his Brethren and their Seede. And as young Children, were they fed, Such was the tyme of neede. 17 For in the Land was want of Bread, the Dearth exceeding sore, In Egipt, and in Canan Land, was neuer lyke before. 18 So that by reason of the Dearth these Countries famisht were, And Ioseph gathered all the Coyne and Monie that was there 19 For to bee found, for Corne and Grayne, the which of him they bought, And layd it safe in Pharoes house, as faythful Seruauntes ought. 20 So that when Money fayled them, that Corne they might not buye, Th' Egiptians all to Ioseph came, and on him did they crye: 21 And sayd, our Money all is spent, geeue vs therfore some Bread, For why should we before thy Face with Famishment be deade? 22 Sayd Ioseph then, your Cattell bringe, if Money yours be gonne, And I will geue you Bread to eate, ynough for eu'ry one: 23 So they their Cattle brought to him Horses, and Flockes of Sheepe, Their Asses al, and Heardes of Beastes they wonted were to keepe: 24 And for the same hee gaue them Bread, so mutch as might suffise For one whole Yeare, and then agayne they came, and sayd thus wise, 25 Wee wil not now bide from my Lord, sithe that our Coyne is gonne, And that my Lord our Cattle hath, and Heards of Beastes ech one: 26 There nothinge is amonge vs left, in sight for to bee found: Except it please my Lord to haue our Bodies, and our Grownd. 27 Why shall wee perishe in thy Sight, both wee, and eke our Lande? By reason that the Ground is free from Labour of the Hande? 28 Buy vs, and eke our Land also, and giue vs Bread therefore: So will we binde our selues, and Lande to Pharo euermore. 29 And therefore giue vs Seede to sowe, that we may liue: not dye: And that the Land for want of Tilth, should not in wast thus lye. 30 So Ioseph now bought all the Land of Egipt for the Kinge: And euery Man his Ground had sould, and euery other thinge. Because the Force of Famins powre them greeuously did wrynge. 31 And hee the People did remoue, abrode from Place to Place, Unto the Citties such as were, and so in tyme and space 32 They were remou'de from side to side, or to the Borders end Of Egipt Land, thus Ioseph did abrode the People send. 33 But yet the Land the Preestes possest: theyrs, Ioseph did not buy: For they vppon King Pharoes charge continually did lye. 34 And had theyr ordinary foode, such as the King them gaue, Wherby theyr Land they kept vnsold, and to themselues did saue, 35 Than Ioseph to the People sayd, beholde you see this Day, I for the King you and your Land, haue bought, you not denaye, 36 Loe, heere is Seede for you to sow, goe Eare and Till the Ground, And of Encrease of Grayne and Corne, that thereon shalbe found, 37 You shall the Fift part giue therof, to Pharow for his share, The rest is youres for Seede to Sowe, and for your better fare. 38 Yow may the same at will conuert, to vse for Foode or Meate, For you and for your Housholds al, and Children for to eate. 39 Sayd they, thou hast our Liues preseru'd, let vs sutch Grace yet find, As wee may Pharoes Seruauntes bee, to do what shalb' assignd. 40 Then Ioseph made it for a Lawe remayninge to this Day: That they the fifte parte of encrease, should vnto Pharo pay. 41 And Israell in Egipt dwelt, as you tofore herd tell: And in the Countrey of Goshen did Multiply right well. 42 For they therein Possessions had, and Grew exceedingly, And Iacob there liu'de Seuentene Yeres, and then dyd after dye. 43 An hundreth, Forty and Seuen Yeares, did Iacob liue in al: And so when as the time drew neere, that he from Lyfe must fall: 44 He called Ioseph vnto him, and sayd as doth appeare: Thy Hand now put vnder my Thyghe, and truly to me sweare. 45 If I haue Grace found in thy sight, Deale truly now with mee, In Egipt do not Burye mee, but where my Fathers bee. 46 When I shall sleepe wyth Fathers myne, lette me not heere be staid, But carry me and burye me, where Fathers myne are layd: I wil (sayd Ioseph) do in al, as thou to me hast sayde, 47 Sayd Israel, then Sweare to me: and Ioseph so did Sweare, Towards his Beddes head Iacob then, both blest and prays'd God there. [Cap. 48.] The Contentes of the XLVIII. Chapter. Here Ioseph now with his two Sonnes doth to his Father goe, Iacob Gods promis doth Rehearse, and doth Receiue also The sonnes of Ioseph as his owne, and doth the yonger blisse Before the elder Sonne: whereat theyr Father moued is. 1 Agayne it hapned after this, that one to Ioseph sayd, Thy Father Iacob now is sicke, and very ill apayde. 2 Then Ioseph did hymselfe prepare, his Father for to see, And both his Sonnes toke he wyth hym, each one in his degree: 3 And one to Iacob sayd, behold, thy sonne is come to thee. Then Iacob tooke his strength to him, and on his Bedde satte he. 4 And Iacob vnto Ioseph said, at Luz did God appeere, To mee in Land of Canaan, and gaue me blessing there. 5 And Sayd: behold I will thee make so Fruictfull in the Land, And wil thy Seede so Multiply, in Number as the Sand: 6 And Likewise will I gyue to thee, and to thy Seede also, This Land for a Possession to thine for aye to know. 7 And as concerning thy two Sonnes which borne are vnto thee In Egipt Land before I came to Egipt, thee to see 8 They shalbe myne, as Ruben is and Simeon are myne: But Linage thyne whych thou bee got them after, shalbe thyne: 9 And they after theyr Brethrens names shal called be also, As they in theyr Inheritaunce are named where they go. 10 Now when that I from Padam came, Rahell my wyfe did die, Upon my hand in Canan Land as I the way past by. 11 One halfe Dayes Iourney were not we to come Ephrath vnto, But in the Waye I Buried her as best was so to doe. 12 Then Israel beheld the Sonnes that Ioseph to hym, brought, And sayd to hym, whose Sonnes are these which after me haue sought? 13 Sayd Ioseph then, they are my Sonnes whom God gaue here to mee: Bryng them to mee I may them blesse, for scarsly can I see. 14 For why, the Eyes of Israel were Dymme and Duske of sight: So that he could not wel beholde nor wel discerne the Lighte. 15 Then Ioseph caus'd his Sonnes to come, Iacob did them imbrace: And holding them vpon his knees, did Kisse them on the Face. 16 To Ioseph then sayd Israel, my Sonne, I had not thought Thy face for to haue sene: and yet God hath me hyther brought. 17 And I haue sene thy Seede also vnto my great reioyce: Then Ioseph tooke them from his knees: and so wyth humble voyce 18 Fel flat on ground and worshipt him, and then with his right Hand Toke Ephraim his yonger Sonne and caus'd hym for to stand 19 The left Hand of his Graundsire by: Manasseh so brought he With Left hand his gaynst Iacobs right, by Byrth in his degree. 20 Then Israel his right hand stretcht vpon the yongers head, And his left hand acrosse his Right ful wysely forth he led, 21 And on Manassehs Head it layed, the Elder of the twaine: His Handes thus placed on theyr Heads did so acrosse remayne. 22 Also he Ioseph blest and sayd the God of fathers myne, Beefore whose sight in Reuerent feare they walkte from tyme to tyme, 23 I say, the God which hath me fed the Dayes of al my life, The Angel eke that me preseru'de from ill debate and strife, 24 The Children blesse, and let my name be named on them still. Likewise the Name of Fathers mine, that they may grow and fill, 25 As Fyshe into a multitude, amyd the Earth to bee. When Ioseph, Iacobs right Hand now on Ephraim dyd see, It him dysp?l?eased very much, and therefore, thus dyd hee: 26 His Fathers hand wyth his, hee staide, the same for to remoue, From Ephrims to Manassehs Head, and sayd tweene Feare and Loue: 27 Not so my Father, this is hee the Elder of the twayne, Remoue thy right Hand to his Head, and lette it there remayne. 28 His Father so refus'd to do, as Ioseph badde hym tho, But sayd, I know it well my Sonne, right well I do it know. He shal (said he) a People be, and shall be great also, 29 But his yonge Brother Ephraim, shall greater be then hee, And eke his Seede encreasing still, shall full of Nacions be. 30 So he them blest that Day, and sayd, in thee shall Isrell blisse, And say, as Ephraim God thee make, and as Manasseh is. 31 And Iacob sette the yonger Sonne, the elder Sonne before, As one in whom Gods grace should bee much manifested more. 32 To Ioseph then (sayd he) I Dye, I may not long remayne, And God vnto your Fathers Land, shall guyde you backe againe. 33 I haue thee geuen aboue the rest, a certain peece of Land, Which wyth my Sworde and Bow I gotte, out of the Amorites hand. [Cap. 49.] The Contentes of the XLIX Chapter. Iacob here blesseth all his Sonnes, eche one of them by name, And sheweth them what is to come, as they well finde the same: He geeueth charge to buryed bee whereas his Fathers lye, And plucking vp his feete in Bedde, most quietly doth Dye. 1 Then Iacob called for his Sonnes, and sayd, come vnto me, That I may tell what shall you hap, in future tyme to be: 2 Together gather now your selues, and heare what I shall saye, Geue Eare vnto your Fathers voyce, and beare his words away. 3 Ruben, thou art my Eldest Sonne, of Leah borne by right, Beginning of my Noblenes, my Dignitie, and Might. 4 Unstable as the UUater is, so shalt thou proue alway, And shalt not be the Chief of all, because thou went astraye. 5 And did desoyle thy Fathers Bedde with Bilha, Rahels Maide, By whom two Sonnes I dyd begette, it cannot be denayde. But after thou hadst donne this fact, that Couche away I layd. 6 Also thy Brethren Symeon, and Leui thus I tell, Most cruell Instruments are they, in places where they dwell. 7 In secrets theirs come not my soule, nor Honour myne lykewyse, Shall coupled be wyth them or theirs, but do the same dispyse. 8 For in their wrath. they slew a man, the Sichemites also, And in theyr selfe wyll, dygd a Wall, and dyd it ouerthrowe. 9 And cursed be their furious wrath, for shameles sure it was, And cursed bee their fiersnes fell, it cruell was lyke case. 10 And for the same in Iacob sure, I wyl them both deuyde And skatter them in Israell, abrode on eu'ry side. 11 But Iudah thou my Sonne art he, whom Brethren thyne shall prayse, And in the Necke of Enmies thyne, thou shalt thy hand vp raise. 12 Thy Fathers Children, Brethren thyne, shall downe before the fall: And Iudah thou shalt still preuayle, aboue thy Brethren all, 13 Iudah my Sonne thou shalt come vp, from Mighty spoyles alow, And as a lusty Lyons whelpe, thyne Enmies shall downe throwe, 14 And Lyon like he downe shal couche, and as a Lyonesse Who dare him styrre? or rayse him vp that shall not feele distresse? 15 The Scepter or the Kingdom sure, shall not depart him fro, Nor a lawe geuer tweene his feete, shall passe away and goe. 16 Untyll that Shyloh come, whiche is Gods Sonne to vnderstand, To Iudah shall the People come, together in the Land, 17 And he shall bynd his Asse Foale fast, vnto the pleasant Uyne, And tye his Asses Coult to that, which yeldes the Noblest Wyne. 18 Hee shal his garmentes wash in Wyne, and eke his Cloake also Shal washe in bloud of Grapes the best that in the Country grow. His eies al Red shal glow within, his teeth Mylkewhyte, shal show. 19 And Zebulon my Sonne shal dwel hard by the Salte Sea side, And shall an Harbour be for Shyppes, that waste with Wynd and Tyde. 20 His border shall to Zydon stretch, that's in Phenicia, And hath vppon the East also, the Lande Arabia. 21 And Isachar an Asse shalbe, that's great and stronge of Bone, Hee shal couch down twene burdens twayne, But courage hath he none. 22 And he shall see that rest is good, the Land pleasaunt also, Shall bowe his Shoulder for to beare, and vnder Tribute goe. 23 And Dan my Sonne shalbe a Iudge, the Peoples cause to try, The honour of a Trybe is his, and shalbe till he Dye. 24 Dan shall a Serpent be also, that by the way doth lye, And as an Adder by the Path, that wayteth tyme to Spye, 25 To byte the Horse fast by the Heele, as Rider passeth by, That Ryder his may backward fall, and on the ground to cry. 26 Then Iacob lifted vp his voyce to pray, and thus said he: O Lord my God, I wayted haue for sauing health from thee. 27 An Host of men shal set vppon and vanquishe Gad my Sonne: But yet at last he shal preuayle, and shall them ouerronne. 28 Asher my Sonne in Corne and Frute shal plenteously abounde: And shall geue pleasures for a King his Bread shal fat be found. 29 And Naphtali shalbe a Hynd let goe abrode at large: And with fayre wordes shal ouercome, more then by force of charge 30 Ioseph shalbe a fruiteful Bough euen by the Welspryng syde, The yong smal Boughes &amp; Walls shal climbe, and spread theyr Sprayes ful wyde, 21 And yet the Archers greeued hym, and shotte agaynst him sore, As Brethren his and Potiphar, and many others more. 22 But Iosephes Bow did strong abyde, his Handes and Armes also Did by the Hand of Iacobs God, in Myght and strength styll grow. 23 Of Ioseph, Herdmen are become, it cannot be denayd, He was by God thereto assignde, which Isrell Stone is sayd, 24 Euen by the God of Father thyne, which shall the helpe at Neede, And by the most Almighty God, which shall the Blesse with speede. 25 Wyth Heauenly Blessings from aboue shal God the Blesse and keepe, With Blessings that beneath do lye, and Blessings of the deepe. 26 And eke with Blessinges of the Breastes, and of the Wombe also: Thou shalt of God be bleste alway, where euer that thou goe: 27 The blessing of thy Father sure, shall much more stronger be, Then blessing of myne Elders were, all whych shall light on thee. 28 Yea, euen vppon the head of hym, who seperated was From Brethren his, these blessings shall on hym bee brought to passe. 29 But Beniamin shall as a Wolfe go rauen for his Pray: And what be catcheth in the Morne, at Nyght shal make away. 30 These are the Tribes of Israell, which twelue in number bee, And thus their Father spake to them, and blessed them ye see. 31 And euery one a blessing had, vnto himselfe alone, And after charged them: and sayd, when that my Life is gone: 32 Let me be buryed in the Caue, whereas my Fathers lye, Whych is wythin the Hittits Field, that Ephron is to try. 33 In that same Caue which is in field, of Machpelah by name, Whych Abram bought to bury in, and Ephrons Field wyth same. 34 And there they buried Abraham, Sarah his wife also, Isac, Rebecca, and Leah, I her there buryed too. 35 The Purchase of the Field and Caue and all that therein stoode, Of Heth his Children purchas'de was, to Funerall the good. 36 When Iacob ended had the charge, he gaue his Sonnes vnto, He pluckt his Feete, into the Bedde as some in dying doe. 37 And so he yelded vp his Ghoast, most quietly to see: And to his People gathred was, as he desyr'de to be. [Cap. 50.] The Contentes of the L. Chap. Iacobs Interment is exprest: Ioseph forgeues his Brethren next: And seeth vnto the third degree His Childrens Seede, &amp; then dies hee. 1 Then Ioseph fel on Fathers face, and wept vppon him sore, And kissed him w? heauy cheere as one right sad therefore: 2 And to his seru?ts thus said he, (sutch as Embalme the dead) Let Father mine Embalmed bee, and taken from his Bedde. 3 So Israell Embaulmed was as Ioseph bad in hast. When Forty Dayes accomplisht were, (so longe the Dayes did last Of sutch Men as Embaulmed were) Which time they haue not past. 4 But yet those Folke of Egipt Land that were with Ioseph then, Did sore bewayle the Death of him, iust three Skore Dayes and Ten. 5 And when the Dayes of Mourninge his were past, and gonne away: Then Ioseph spoke to Pharoes House, and on this wise did say: 6 If I haue any fauour found, before your eies at all, I pray you then to Pharo speake, as I now tell you shall. I pray you then to Pharo speake, as I nowe tell you shall: 7 My Father made me sweare, and sayde, My Sonne, behold, I Dye: Entoumbe thou mee in Canaan, whereas my Graue doth lye. 8 Ah las, now therefore lett mee goe, I humbly do the pray, And I my Father burye will, and come agayne this way. Sayd Pharao then, goe vp, and do, as Father made the Say. 9 So Ioseph with his Father went: with him there went as tho The Elders of Kinge Pharoes House, and Seruaunts his also: Yea all the Elders of the Lande likewise with them did go 10 All Iosephes House, and Brethren his, his Fathers House likewise: Theyr Children onely, and their Sheepe, hee did as then deuise 11 To leaue behinde in Goshen Land, till their returninge backe. They went with Horse, and Chariottes store, no furniture did lack. 12 And when they came beyonde Iordan. Goren Atad vnto, With greeuous Lamentation they made there mutch ado: 13 And Ioseph there his Fathers Death bemoaned seuen dayes longe: And when the Cananites this sawe, they sayd them selues amonge: 14 This is vnto th' Egiptians, a Mourning great, we see, And so their Lamentacion they nam'de the place to bee. 15 Thus Iacobs Sonnes did vnto him, as hee to them had sayd: They caryed him to Canan Lande, and in the Caue him layde, 16 Which is in Field of Machpelah that Abram somtime bought Of Ephron, neere to Mamre soyle, an Hittite as is tought. 17 When Iosephes Father buried was, they all return'de agayne Into Egipt, where Ioseph gaue them thankes, for all their payne. 18 But now when Iosephes Brethren sawe, their Father dead and gone: Perhaps sayd they that Ioseph will his Wrath vs wreake vpon: 19 And wil vs hate, and pay agayne the Ill that wee haue done. Therfore to him, they sent and sayd: Ioseph, old Iacobs Sonne, 20 Thy Father did commaundment geeue before hee went away, Thus shall you Ioseph speake vnto, forgeeue I now thee pray 21 The Trespasse of thy Brethren past, that they haue done to thee: And now forgeeue our fault likewise, for wee Gods Seruauntes bee. 22 When they thus vnto Ioseph spake hee wept a certayne space, And in that Tyme his Brethren came, and fel before his face: 23 And sayd, behold thy Seruauntes wee, attend vpon thy wyll: Feare not (sayth hee) for vnder God I am and wil bee still. 24 When you pretended ill to mee, God turn'de it to the best, That hee might bring such thinges to passe, as this day is exprest. 25 And many People sau'd aliue, that els had now bene gone: Feare not therefore, Ile norishe you, and Children yours ech one. 26 So kindely vnto them hee spake, and entertaynde so well, It was more comfort to their hart, then any toung can tell. 27 Thus Ioseph and his Fathers house: in Egipt dwelled styll: He lyu'de an Hundreth yeares and tenne, and then did Death him kill. 28 The Children yet of Ephraim did Ioseph lyue to see, Unto the third descent of them by order in degree. 29 Lykewise hee Machirs Children saw, Manassehs Sonne that was, Whom Ioseph brought vp on his knees, and thus it came to passe: 30 That Ioseph to his Brethren sayd, I readye am to dye, And God wil surely visite you, as time the thing shall trye. 31 And bring you safe out of this Land vnto the Land hee sware To Abram, Isac, and Iacob, and ryd you so from care. 32 Then of the Children of Isrell an Oath did Ioseph take, And sayd, God (sure) wil visite you, for his great mercies sake. 33 And you shal cary hence my boanes, thus did hee Prophecie, Beeing an Hundreth yeares and Tenne, and in that Age did dye. 34 And after, they embaulmed him, and put him in a Chest In maner as his Father was, so him, th' Egyptians drest.
