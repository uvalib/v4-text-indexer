      <field name="fulltext">SONG AND NO SONG. Sung by Mr. Mathews, at the Theatre Royal, English Opera House, in the “Bashful Man.” Air—“Go to the Devil and shake yourself.” ‘There was once’—I declare I've begun it too high— ‘There was once’—I beg pardon, I've pitch'd it too low, ‘There was once’—in a different key I'll now try, ‘There was once on a time’—it began so I know. Tis vexing, 'tis odd—I sha'n't hit it, I doubt— ‘There was once on a time’—dear, I'm singing too fast— ‘There was once on a time’—in the time I'm quite out— I'm afraid that I shall not get through it at last. ‘There was once on a time’—I'm as hoarse as a crow— I've no voice, a'n't in cue—you'll laugh at me, 'tis plain; You must really excuse me—I'm willing you know— ‘There was once on a time’—I'll begin it again. ‘There was once on a time’—I've a very bad cold, ‘That a man’—no, ‘a woman’—no, no, 'twas ‘a man’— ‘Was called on to sing, so the story is told’— I cannot get through it, do all that I can. ‘This man,’ as I said, ‘was call'd on for a song, ‘Or to drink salt and water, an odd sort of choice; ‘And being called on’—I shall not keep you long, But I've been eating nuts, which are bad for the voice. ‘Being called on to sing,’ and, like me, half afraid, Though, like me, by his side, he a beautiful girl had, He said, ‘let me see’—oh, he got up and said, ‘Damme I must go, there's a hole in the ballad.’ ANALIZATION. Sung by Mr. Vale, at the Surrey Theatre. What are mortals made of? By analization I've tried all the nation, Defined each gradation, And prov'd every station, With Sir Humphry's best New chemical test, And found what mortals are made of. What are little girls made of? A bib and a tucker, And cheeks in a pucker, Caps, corals, and beads, And samplers and dolls, Cakes, and caudle, sugar and spice, Mamma's darling and all that is nice, And such are our little girls made of! What are our little boys made of? Of long tasks saying, And truant playing, Pulling and hauling, And teazing and bawling, Bats and balls, and whips and tops, Dogs-ear'd books and dirty chops, And such are are little boys made of! What are our young maids made of? Of concerts and dances, And sanctified glances. Bows and bonnets, And very fine sonnets, Boarding-school graces, and ribbons and laces, And sweet pretty faces, when kept in their places, And such are our young maids made of! What are our young men made of? Of larks and sprees, And do as they please, Horses and hounds, And “dammes,” and “zounds!” Life in London, and Tom and Jerry, Past twelve at night, and port and sherry, And such are our young men made of! What are young lovers made of? Of fond valentines, And amorous lines, Ducks and dears, And crocodile tears, Licence and ring, love, honour, obey, Bride-cake and favours, and the devil to pay, And such are our young lovers made of. What are our young wives made of Of honey-moon, And storm very soon, Dears and loves, And turtle doves, Kisses and blisses, and all that's good, That is, if they're rightly understood, And such are our young wives made of! What are our husbands made of? Of sulks and huffs, And kicks and cuffs, Conjugal rights, And raking at nights, Drinking and swearing, and this and that, Doctors' Commons and no one knows what And such are our husbands made of! What are our old maids made of? Of thrown away sighs, And crow's-feet eyes, Sprigs of rue, And vinegar, too, Parchment skin and hoarded riches, Apes to lead, and bachelor's breeches, And such are our old maids made of! What are old bachelors made of? Of bread and cheese, And very weak knees, Drivelling nose, And rheumatic toes, Funded riches and landed estate, Worn out smalls and a very bald pate, And such are old bachelors made of! What are our widows made of? Of title deeds, And very deep weeds, A terrible sigh, When there's any one nigh, Jointures, scan. mag, toast and tea, Prudery, flirting, and fiddle-de-dee, And such are our widows made of! What are our rulers made of? Of souls to feel, For the public weal, A hand to give, And a heart to save; Making us Britons all loyally sing With heart and soul “Long live the King,” And such are our rulers made of! What are our statesmen made of? Debates and speeches, To spend our riches, Wisdom great, To take care of the State, Nice cheese-parings, ways and means, Loaves and fishes and candle-ends, And such are our statesmen made of! What are our judges made of? Of Westminster Hall, And ermine withal, Learned brother, And lots of pother, Counsel and jury and very wise looks, Flaw in the indictment and statute books, And such are our judges made of! What are our officers made of? Of power and skill, Opponents to kill; A heart without fear, When the enemy's near, And generous pity, that ever is shown, To a fallen foe, when the battle is won, And such are our officers made of! What are our merchants made of? Of a careful pate, And charity great, Plenty of gold, And worth untold, Counting-house and London's pride, And I think I may add the world's beside, And such are our merchant's made of! What are our M. P.'s made of? Of a bought rotten Boro' And loyalty thoro,' Of “aye” and “no,” And a time-serving bow, Economy bills, thro' the house to be pass'd, But always an eye to a good place, at last, And such are our M. P.'s made of! What are our Parsons made of? Of Latin and Greek. And prayers, once a week; Good living and port, And a text of a sort; Parsonage house and a great bush wig, And a nice little smug curling tail'd tithe pig, And such are our parsons made of. What are our doctors made of? Of Warwick Lane, A fee and a cane, Rhubarb and manna, And ipecacuanha, Lotions, potions—powders and pills, Visiting gig and long physicing bills, And such are our doctors made of. What are our lawyers made of? Of causes and fees, Demurrers and pleas, The Court of King's Bench, Where bills they retrench, A dreadful long brief and a terrible case, Tax'd costs and a very wry face. And such are our lawyers made of! What are our Authors made of? Of paste and shears, And folks by the ears, A grey goose quill, And fiction at will, Stolen materials—foolscap and ink, Lots of pretence and very little chink, And such are our authors made of? What are our aldermen made of? Of citizens' gains, And gowns and gold chains, Turtle and claret, As long as they'll bear it; Companies dinners and Guildhall chair, Common Hall and hopes to be Mayor, And such are aldermen made of! What are stock brokers made of? Of bulls and bears And companies shares, Cash in the funds, And Columbian bonds, Cent. per cent. and a slice of the loan, Lame duck and a 'Change Alley groan, And such are stock brokers made of. What are our players made of? Of masquerade speeches, And other men's breeches, Ranting and raillery, Box, pit, and gallery, Hosts of friends on a benefit night, And lots of applause whene'er they act right, And such are our players made of! What are musicians made of? Of crotchets and quavers, And great people's favours, Cat gut to teaze, And horse hair to please, Gamut and rosin—and airs and graces Flats and sharps, and lots of grimaces, And such are musicians made of! What are our dandies made of? Of whiskers and snuff, Of padding and puff, A glass to the eye When a female is nigh, Sham collar—false calves and hair, Stays laced and a head like a bear, And such are our dandies made of. What are our Quakers made of? Of broad cloth and starch, And a deal board march, Thee and thou, And beaver on brow, Meeting house and verily friend, And yeas and nays without any end, And such are our quakers made of! What are our soldiers made of? Of scarlet and lace, And a brazen face, Country quarters, And maidens in garters, Ale-house scores and trumpets and drums, Oaths and scars and bullets and bombs, And such are our soldiers made of! What are our sailors made of? Of pitch and tar, Pig-tail and scar, Powder and smoke, And hearts of oak, Prize money and gold galore, With a fidler and grog and a girl on shore, And such are our sailors made of! What are our Pawnbrokers made of? Of money lent, At twenty per Cent. Apparel and plate, And a duplicate, Three nice golden balls hanging out, A little back door and a very large spout, And such are our pawnbrokers made of! What are our audiences made of? Of generous friends, With helping hands, Ready to serve, All those who deserve; “Hats off”—“down”—“encore” and noise, Pretty girls and merry boys, And such are our audiences made of! GOOD DOCTRINE. Sung by Mr. Harley, at the Theatrical Fund Dinner, Drury Lane Beef Steak Club, &amp;c. &amp;c. Air—“Derry down.” Twelve parsons, once went, to a 'Squire's to dine, Who was famous for giving good ven'son and wine: All great friends to the cloth, with good living in view, Quite grace-full they sat down, as parsons should do! Derry down, down, down, derry down! A wicked young whipster, our worthy 'Squire's cousin, Whisper'd—“Cousin, I boldly will lay rump and dozen, Though here we've a dozen staunch parsons, God wot, Not one of the twelve has a prayer-book got.” Derry down, &amp;c. “Agreed!” cried the 'Squire,—“Coz, we must not be loth, Such a wager to lay, for the sake of the cloth: The parsons, no doubt, to confute you, are able, So we'll bring, with the dinner, the bet on the table.” Derry down, &amp;c. Dinner came: cried the 'Squire—“A new grace I will say, Has any one here got a prayer-book, pray?” Quite glum look'd the priests, cough'd, and with one accord, Cried “Mine's lost!”—“Mine's at home!”—“Mine's at church, by the Lord!” Derry down, &amp;c. Quoth our cousin—“Dear 'Squire, I my wager have won, But another I purpose to win, ere I've done; Though the parsons could not bring a prayer-book to view, I the same bet will lay, they have each a corkscrew.” Derry down. &amp;c. “Done! done!” roared the 'Squire—“Holloa, butler! bring nearer That excellent magnum of ancient Madeira.” 'Twas brought—“Let's decant it—a corkscrew, good John’— Here each of the parsons roar'd out—“I've got one” Derry down, &amp;c. MORAL. But let us not censure our parsons for this, When a thing's in its place, it can ne'er come amiss, Pray'r-books won't serve for corkscrews, and I'm such a sinner, Though a sermon I like, I don't want it at dinner. Derry down, &amp;c. THE LADIES. Sung by Mr. Harley, at Drury Lane Theatre. Air—“Oh, cruel.” Of good Queen Bessy's golden days our histories still ring, Her reign was never yet surpassed by that of any King, And should our maidens follow her example you'd see then. That the Ladies would do all things much better than the men. Tooral looral, &amp;c. Prime Ministers they'd aptly make, each husband will allow, When petticoats have government we all of us must bow, As rulers, time still proves the fair possess the greatest skill, For, say or do whate'er we will, the Ladies rule us still. Tooral looral, &amp;c. That well the Ladies could our armies lead we all can see, For tell me who like woman can command the infantry, Let her but as white sergeant act, to fight who could defer, There's not a man of us who wouldn't live and die for her. Tooral looral, &amp;c. That greatly she'd the pulpit grace is clear as is the day, For who'd not soar to virtue when an angel leads the way! And that the woolsack she'd adorn I've said and say again, For after all the Ladies are best judges of us men. Tooral looral, &amp;c. That they are best of Counsellers, is clear to old and young, For how can woman fail when she has got to use her tongue, And that they'd best of Doctors prove, is equally as sure, For where's the ill in life, I ask, a Lady cannot cure. Tooral looral, &amp;c. As Vintners and Distillers who can doubt the Ladies merits, For who so like the Ladies still can put a man in spirits. That good Upholsterers they'd be, I'll prove, too, in a minute, For no house can be furnish'd if there's not a Lady in it. Tooral looral, &amp;c. As Tailors to their merits every Tailor still must bow, So well do they suit all mankind as all men must allow, As Smiths each Smith the mastery still yield unto his wife, For, oh, the chains the Ladies forge are chains that last for life. Tooral looral, &amp;c. That they'd make famous Nurserymen our children fully prove, And were they but our Gardeners for tulips none would rove, Such flowers within themselves they'd be, they still would would charm life's fever, Be Balsam to our anguish. and Heart's-ease prove for ever. Tooral looral, &amp;c. As Proctors they'd be perfect, for they still our wills controul, Our marriage licenses they grant, and wedlock's cares console; Then that they should our Grocers be you surely won't contemn, For no one can deny that all the sweets are found in them. Tooral looral &amp;c. And thus I think I've clearly prov'd the Ladies all in all, And while we've them to aid us, that Old England ne'er can fall, And 'tis my firm belief they might soon bring men to that station, To be merely kept as make-weights in the scale of population.

Air—“Devil on two sticks.” Bob Pointer drove a stage, all day, From Dunstable to London, merrily, While, all night, on a stage, he'd play His part correct and readily: He was stage-struck, in youth, By some players, one night, And, from that time, a stage Was his only delight. Cantering, Bantering, Splashing on, Dashing on, Tooling 'em, Fooling 'em, Down the Strand, Four-in-hand, Yes, still he drove a stage, all day, From Dunstable to London, merrily; While, all night, on a stage he'd play His part correct and readily. Prose text has been omitted here. Thus, still he drove a stage all day, &amp;c. Charles Mathews was not more “At Home,” Than Pointer in “Mail Coach Adventures;” Nor through his “Trips” could Mathews roam More free from public censures: Nor Astley's could show, Though Ducrow you might see, More brilliant Equestrian Spectacles than he. As down the Strand, Four-in-hand, Cantering, Bantering, Dashing on, Splashing on, Tooling 'em, Fooling 'em, For still he drove a stage day, &amp;c. Prose text has been omitted here. Thus, still Bob drove a stage all day, &amp;c. His part on each stage Bob dispatches with glee, Knows the “Innkeeper's Daughter” with great facility, No one can get through a length quicker than he, He has such rare ability. In the fam'd “Road to Ruin,” He ne'er rode, nor will, Though he's gone through the “Turnpike Gate,” Oft with great skill. Ranting And flaunting, And tooling, And fooling, Cantering, Bantering, Down the Strand, Four-in-hand, For still Bob drove a stage all day, &amp;c. Prose text has been omitted here.

Our hackney coaches now are hacks, Their fares don't fairly pay the tax, His whip the coachman sadly smacks, Such opposition doom'd to know; And as for all our cabriolets, Their horses now may dance the hays. They really cannot make their ways, But truly sigh, I owe. Our chariots, not triumphant now, To other vehicles must bow, For France has work'd their overthrow, They taste the luxury of woh! Kew—Putney—with their seven stages, Droop like Shakspeare's Seven Ages! For the Omnibus the rage is, Yes, 'tis all the go. Prose text has been omitted here. Kew—Putney—with their seven stages, Droop like Shakspeare's Seven Ages! For the Omnibus the rage is, Yes, 'tis all the go. The Omnibus is so complete, So slender, so genteel, so neat, To ride inside, 'tis quite a treat, To go by stages now is low; No better scheme was ever tried, For side by side, we equal ride, To pamper pride, there's no outside, But all sit in a row; The march of intellect, you'll own, Is by the Omnibusses shewn, Such comfort sure was never known, For books to cheer us they bestow; And worthy of supreme remark, They scorn to keep us in the dark, But still each night to cheer each spark, A light on us they throw. Prose text has been omitted here. Kew—Putney—with their seven stages, Droop like Shakspeare's Seven Ages! The Omnibus now all the rage is Yes, 'tis all the go. WONDERFUL LONDON. Sung by Mr. C. Taylor, at Convivial Parties. Air,—“I am a jolly Pedlar.” While travellers of Paris prate, And Rome, where mobs are undone, I'll find a subject far more great, At home, delightful London! For all the world are shewn up there, Such marvels are by none done; There all that's right, and rich, and rare, The treasures of the earth repair, Delightful wondrous London! Oh that's the town, for king and clown, Of each sweet folly mother; There, genteel houses, up and down, All jostle one another. There all the streets are ever full Of people made and undone; And Johnny Bull, walks, cheek by jowl, With saint and sinner, sage and fool, Delightful wondrous London! There, generals from tailors run, And bailiffs scare the boldest And mama's dress, is so like miss, You scarce know which is oldest. There coaches, carts, and cabriolets, By turns each other run down; While stages, waggons, gig, and chaise, And vans and drays, block up our ways, Delightful wondrous London! There, palaces and prisons meet, Play-house 'gainst work-house labours; And gin shops greet, sirs, in a street, The pawn-brokers their neighbours. Bazaars tempt country ninnyhammers, Who're by their bargains undone; With Panoramas, Neoramas, Georamas, Dioramas, Delightful wondrous London! There honesty still goes threadbare, And worth oft wants a dinner, While vice can silks and satins wear, And struts a saucy sinner. There dashing bucks that walk in rules, Old women knock, for fun, down; With knaves and fools, and rogues, and tools, And doctors, proctors, scorning schools, Delightful wondrous London! There many a shewy outside walks, With inside monstrous hollow; And many a pompous blockhead stalks, While greater blockheads follow. And empty cits, that pass for wits, Prate wisdom with a pun down; And each man as his fancy hits, Is grave, or gay, or nought, by fits Delightful wondrous London! There still there's widows, mothers, maids, All sadly husbands wanting; At mornings frights, but changed at nights, To angels most enchanting. And villas, houses, shops to let, With each convenience known, sirs, That all perfection seem, but yet You'll find, when once you in them get, Are much best let alone, sirs. New bridges, streets, and colliseums, New markets, new hotels, too, New club-houses, and new Lyceums, New chapels, and new hells, too; New hospitals, where crowds are killed, And cures are none in ten done; New churches, which by scores they build, Although the old ones ne'er were filled. Delightful wondrous London! There's writing peers, and trading clowns, Quack doctors, poets, lawyers; Ambassadors from foreign crowns, Flue-fakers, and top sawyers. Fine lady-birds, great lords protect, Who're made by being undone, And journeymen who work neglect, All through the March of Intellect, Delightful wondrous London! There's learned shoe-blacks, servant maids, The first in fashion's flocks, sirs; And beggars, who're such genteel blades, They beg with double knocks, sirs. There's remedies for each disease, Great cures they've every one done, And charities each woe that ease With exhibitions all that please, Delightful wondrous London! There's porters with their “by your leaves,” That in the kennel shove you; Tax-gatherers, aldermen, and thieves, And ladies that “my love,” you. There's boxers, actors, sons of fun, Ward, Curtis, Liston, Munden; There's every virtue 'neath the sun, And every vice, too, daily done, In charming wondrous London. THREE PART MEDLEY Sung by Mr. Sloman, at the Theatre Royal, English Opera House. FIRST PART. The Nightingale Club, in a village was held, At the sign of the Cabbage and Shears, Where the singers, no doubt, would have greatly excell'd, But for want of — Four-and-twenty fiddlers all of a row, Four-and-twenty fiddlers — Peaceful slumbering — At the town of neat Clogheen, Where — The Graces they were gathering posies, And found — The finest ram, sir, that ever was fed on hay: This ram was fat behind, sir, this ram was fat before, This ram was — A flaxen-headed cow boy, as simple as may be, And next, a merry plough boy, who whistled — Old King Cole, was a merry old soul, And a merry old soul was he, He called for — The lass of Patie's mill, so bonny, blithe, and gay, In spite of all my skill, she stole — A bold dragoon, with his — O dear! what can the matter be! Dear, dear, what can the matter be — For, of all the girls that are so smart, There's none like pretty Sally, She is the darling of my heart, And she lives with — Robin Adair; What made the ball so fine? What made the assembly shine? Oh! it was — The rum old Commodore, The battered old Commodore, For the bullets and the gout, Have so knock'd his hull about, That he'll never more be fit for — The Maid of Lodi, who sweetly sung — Call again to-morrow, call again to-morrow; Can't you, can't you, call again to-morrow. PART SECOND. A master I have, and I am his man, Gallopping dreary dun, And he'll get — A regiment of Irish dragoons, and they were quartered — In a mouldering cave, the abode of despair; As Britannia sat weeping her loss — She mourn'd for her Wolfe, and exclaim'd in despair — 'Twas in the good ship Rover, I sail'd the world around, And for ten years, and over, I never touch'd — Roy's wife of Aldivalloch, Roy's wife of Aldivalloch! Wot ye how she cheated me — In the Bay of Biscay, O! Cease, rude Boreas, blustering railer, List, ye landsmen, all to me: Messmates, hear a brother sailor, Sing — Oh, hush thee, my darling, the hour will soon come, When thy sleep shall be broken, by — The wood-pecker tapping the hollow beech tree, The wood-pecker tapping — Poor Sally's wooden-ware, Who all for money barters: Her cottons, tapes, her top-knots rare, Her bodkins, lace, and — Paddy Shannon, high mounted, on his trotting little pony, Who set off on a journey, from Leather lane to Bow, To ogle Widow Wilkins, whom he courted for—her money, And, tugging at his bridle, cried — Don't I look spruce on my Neddy, In spite of his kicking and prancing? Gee up, and come hither, boy, steady; Mr. Neddy, I'm not fond of dancing — When absent from her, whom my soul holds most dear — What a medley—what a medley of — Old chairs to mend! old chairs to mend! — A very good song, and very well sung, And we're jolly companions every one — Thus the Nightingale Club, daily kept up their clamour, And we're nightly knock'd down, by the president's hammer. We're nightly, we're nightly knock'd down, knock'd down by the president's hammer! PART THIRD. Your pardon, kind gentlefolks, pray, I'm call'd, once more, to roar out a song, sir, And when a lad's call'd on—they say — Come bustle, neighbour Prig, Buckle on your hat and wig, In your Sunday's clothes so gaily — Together we will range the fields — When the wolf in nightly prowl, Bays the moon with — Will you come to the bower I have shaded for you? Your bed shall be — On that spot, in ancient lore oft named, Where — Giles Scroggins courted Molly Brown, Ri tol de riddle lol de ray! The fairest wench in all our town, Tiddle lol de riddle lol de ray! If you love me, as I love you, — On this cold flinty rock, I will lay down my head, And sweetly I'll sing — Bound 'prentice to a waterman, I learnt a bit to row, But, bless your heart, I always was so gay, That to treat — An old woman in Yorkshire, in Yorkshire she did dwell — She lov'd — Billy Taylor, a brisk young fellow, Full of mirth, and full of glee. And his mind he did diskiver — To a frog, who would a woing go, Heigho! says Rowley. Whether his mother would let him or no, with his — Here's a health to all good lasses! Here's a health to all good lasses! Here's a health to — Our Gracious Queen! Long live our noble Queen! God save the Quee Send her victorious, Happy and glorious, Long to reign over us, God save the Queen! CHAPTER OF RHYMES. Sung by Mr. Woulds, at Vauxhall Gardens Air—“Vive Tivoli,” or “Le Zephyr.” My chapter of chimes, And of truth-telling rhymes, I've run o'er many times, For of wisdom they're full; First birth rhymes to mirth, And boy rhymes to toy, And child rhymes to spoil'd, And fool rhymes to school; Then Miss rhymes to kiss, And kiss rhymes to bliss, While court rhymes to sport, And coo rhymes to woo; Approve rhymes to love, And love rhymes to dove, And dove rhymes to grove, And true rhymes to new.

H. Williams, at Vauxhall Gardens Air—“Merrily danc'd the Quaker's wife,” I am the man vot came to town, And met vot I shall mention— A man vot though but a country clown, Vos von vot vanted a pension. I vent to a house vot places books, For folks vot go to London, And saw a man, vot lik'd my looks, Von vot von't leave nothing undone. Fol de rol lol, &amp;c. “By vot coach, sir, vill you take ving, Pray vot is your decision? Here's von vot is the slap-up thing, And von vot's the opposition. If you are the man vot vants a place, Here is a coach vot's got von; Vhich has the horses vot can race. Vhile t'other's the coach vot has not none!” I am the man the coach vot drives, Vot makes the titts knock under, And here's the Guard, vot looks arter your lives, And vot takes care of the plunder! And here's the cad vot vaits on me, Vot catches the flats like vinking, Vhile master's the svell vot drives so free, Though 'tis you vot pays the chink in. Though this vos a coach vot had a load, I vos von vot got in it But there vos a rut vot cross'd the road, And vot spilt us in a minute! They brought a man vot cur'd each ill, Says I—‘here's a man vot needs you;” Says he—“I'm the man vot gives the pill, The doctor vot sveats and bleeds you.” His bill, for vot he call'd a cure, But vot I call'd a swindle, Vos von vot no one could endure, And vot made my money dvindle; So he sent a man vot follow'd the law, Von vot vos an attorney, Who sent another vot had a claw, Vot stopp'd me on my journey. “If you're the man vot doesn't pay,” Says he, “I'm von vot makes you; If you're the covey vot runs avay,” “Vy I'm the covey vot takes you! The doctor's the man vot physicks you, The lawyer's the man vot tricks you,— And you are the flat vot tries do, And I am the trap vot nicks you.” Then up came a lass vot look'd like a dove, A lass vot dress'd so smart, too; I felt, for her, vot is call'd love, In vot is call'd my heart, too. But though a man vot's us'd to town, In a vay vot vos wery funny— I vos the von vot vos knock'd down, She the von vot got my money!

Sung by Mr. Davidge, at the Victoria Theatre. A parish clerk, was Johnny Bell, No words away e'er throwing; But Mrs. Bell, was a noisy belle, For her clapper was alays going. John cried, I am a stupid elf, To be jeer'd by all the people, But I'll hang my cares up, with myself, So he hung himself in the steeple. Prose text has been omitted here. Ding, dong, ding dong, ding dong. The ringers came, who rang so well, And found, as the story tells, Among the ropes, the rope where Bell Was hanging among the bells. We came to ring a merry round, For mutton and trimmings, they said— Our mutton's lost, but we have found, A man as mutton dead. Prose text has been omitted here. Ding, dong, &amp;c. They cut him down, and quickly found Poor Johnny was not dead; His mortuum rope 'tis true was cut, Not so his vital thread! “Why did you do this act so dread?” They one and all did cry— Poor Johnny star'd at them, and said, I hung myself to try. Prose text has been omitted here. Ding, dong, &amp;c. While Johnny Bell hung there, 'tis true, The steeple high to deck, Mistress Bell was hanging too, Round Major George's neck. John caught them both, and to enrage her, He thump'd the Major's nob; For Johnny Bell, he lov'd no major, But merry Major Bob. Prose text has been omitted here. Ding, dong, &amp;c. This Mrs. Bell's soft heart soon broke, And wonderful, but true, When death her vital current stopp'd, Her clapper it stopp'd, too. Cried John, ‘there is no harmony Springs from one bell alone, So I'll get another, whose tongue shall not Be louder than my own.” Prose text has been omitted here. Ding, dong, &amp;c. THE PICKWICK TRIAL! OR, BREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE! Sung by Mr. W. J. Hammond, at the Strand Theatre. Music sold by John Dumcombe and Co. 10, Middle Row, Holborn. There can be no sort of denial, That an anxious thing is a trial, When you've got to rely all On L-A-W Law! No matter what it's for,— Debt, contract, or Faux Pas; I don't wish the law to disparage, But I'll tell of a shocking miscarriage, 'Bout a breach of promise of marriage, In which justice show d a flaw. I'll show the chance of law, Which has such a very long claw! Its Quirks and Vexation. Expence and Ruination— Its tricks and its Evasion, Glorious uncertain law! Prose text has been omitted here. For Quirks, and for Vexation, Expence and Ruination— For Tricks and for Evasion There's nothing like the Law! With many a fine oration, And cross-examination, They prove to demonstration, What they're contending for. Each other they clapperclaw, Till their wigs are ready to thaw— Like Richard the Third at Drury, The counsel all sound and fury, Address'd to the Judge and Jury, And their attention draw. You'd think them really at war, But bless you it is all jaw. For Quirks and for Vexation, Expence and Ruination, For Tricks, and for Evasion, There's nothing like the Law! Prose text has been omitted here. For quirks, &amp;c. THE MARCH OF INTELLECT; OR, MECHANICAL ACADEMICS. Sung by Mr. Fitzwilliam and Mr. C. Taylor, at all the Public Concerts, Festival Dinners, &amp;c. Air—Mr. Simpkins.” Oh, Time! how strangs thy changes— Learning's now become mechanical; Scientific men and scholars, Are seized with a sudden panic all. The lower classes in the classic art, Are penny-trating low; And operative learning has So work'd it's way, it's all the go! Tol lol lol, &amp;c. Now, thanks to Doctor Birkbeck, And Mechanics Institutions, The state of things are turning Upside down, by resolutions. Plain speaking now is banish'd quite, All patter metaphorical; Each dirty court is styled a place, In manner alleygorical! Tol lol lol, &amp;c. Our workmen, now, all leave their work, For verse, without apology; Now, if you twice your 'prentice teach, He'll tell you 'tis taught-ology. Our journeymen, while walking, Are all studying toe-pography; And all who sell last dying speeches, Prate about Buy-ography. Tol lol lol, &amp;c. The Barber takes you by the nose, And talks about Conk-ology; While Warehousemen, in Thames Street, Are adepts in Crane-iology. While Mendicants and Paupers. Quite consistent in their actions, While breaking stones upon the road, Still practise Vulgar Fractions. Tol lol lol, &amp;c. Undertakers, o'er their coffins, The dead languages are studying; While Dustmen, with the ground work Of the Arts, their brains are muddying. Clerks, with Pestalozzian systems Pester us in lectures prolix— E'en Waggoners, who up hill go, Are thinking of High-draw-lics. Tol lol lol, &amp;c.

Among our Sweeps, the climbing boys, Are, in their garrets, attic all, While Cats' meat-sellers, from their cellars, Answer most dog-matical.

Sung by the late Mr. Mathews, in his Entertainments, and at the Haymarket Theatre. Music sold by John Duncombe and Co. 10, Middle Row, Holborn. I've just come from the City, friends, And if you, in this crisis, The Market's state would really learn, And know the current prices— Tis I can truly tell you them, Though every hour they vary; For instance—Drugs are on the move, While Paper's stationary! Tol, lol, lol, &amp;c. There's in Tobacco good returns, While snuffs are freely taken: Per contra, Mats are very flat, Though Masts remain unshaken. While Lead, it goes off heavily, And Leather's at a stand— But Hops are very brisk indeed, Though Hemp still hangs on hand. Tol, lol, lol, &amp;c. Steel goods look dull—but Capers Lively are, and on the go; And Bristles they are getting up, While Spirits are but low. Then Glass has greatly fallen, But, what needn't much surprise— 'Tis whisper'd 'mongst the Doctors, Castor Oils are like to rise. Tol, lol, lol, &amp;c. Then raw goods are improving— Heavy goods are but a drag— There is a great cry out for wool, Though Colours somewhat flag. For Coffee there's a call, altbough For Blubber few will bid.

Of Feathers we are nearly pluck'd, And Logwood don't look bright— On Tallow there's a run, Though calls for Candles are but light.

Of Corn there's great consumption, But Chaff's still on the decline— While Dyes are lively, Opium's a drug, So, too, is Wine! Good Deals are down, while Firs are high, Of Gums there's scarce a sup, Though Microscopes and Telescopes Continue looking up. Tol, lol, lol, &amp;c.

Teeth yet retain their hold—Tongues, they Still continue wagging, While Starch keeps stiffly up—but Rags are Really going begging! Tol, lol, lol, &amp;c. Brown Crush has got up lately, And Dates cannot be quoted— Quicksilver's steady—Sables a Dead article are voted: Deer Skins are cheaper—Hartshorn is Reviving 'tis confest; No Sails are made of canvas, Though ticking's in request. Tol, lol, lol, &amp;c. In Geneva nothing's doing—Hollands Are as dull as ever; Though of Lisbon many parcels, Are arriving in the River; While Mountains they are very low, and— Nay, restrain your laughter— Horse hair, in tails, continues, as of Wont, to be look'd after! Tol, lol, lol, &amp;c, There is no cracking about nuts, They really are so bad; But from our letters still we find, That Seals are to be had. Folks cotton much to worsted— Parchments greatly are engross'd. And Raisins go off currently— Though of Horns few cits make boast. Tol, lol, lol, &amp;c. This is the market's latest state, Upon the Stock Exchange; Which proves we're not quite ruin'd yet, Though some may think it strange. In Mark Lane—not in Mincing Lane— I live, and if you're bent On buying, my Commission, friends, Is only cent per cent. Tol, lol, lol, &amp;c. THE ASSIZE BALL! Sung by Mr. W. H.

A genuine new England lad, On Marble Hill, a nester; I've come a-head to make a trade, A regular Down Easter! 'Twas longest day when I was born, And not all fools, I thank'ye; For I'm, though Northerners may scorn, A real down right Yankey. My dad he was a clever dog, A meetin he was Dean of— And I—why I'm a Hickory log With the bark so slick and clean off. To tell my deeds, whom I bequeath, Must not possess a slow pen, For I was born with wisdom teeth, And both my eyes wide open. As hard as rock, as slick as silk, That none should ever head me; For pap they gave me mush and milk, And then with sweet saarse feed me. My dad, &amp;c. At school I twirl'd 'em round about, In turning dumps to dollars; I flogged my master out and out, And then whipp'd all the scholars. At making bargains, all the folks Thought me a tarnal Crittur— I bought and sold myself, for jokes, And fairly beat all natur. My dad, &amp;c. I'm spry to trade in any thing, From steam boat to a save all; My store shall fetch what it will bring, For I'll of best most, have all. If when I sleep my eyes I close, I'm such a funny jester— You'll find cock'd up my ears and nose, A regular Down Easter! My dad, &amp;c. THE TWELVE COMPANIES. Sung by Mr. C.

First on the list, the Stationers, Must dear be to the Muses; The best aid of the Poet— Who to sing their praise refuses? Still may they stationary be, For learning's circulation: For paper currency we know, Has often sav'd the nation. Tol de rol, &amp;c. Apothecaries, all must laud, They balm our mortal ills; And I could physic those, who would Run down their draughts and pills! Still may we meet in health, and own We owe that health to them— May they but want their drugs for those, Their labours who'd condemn! Tol de rol, &amp;c. In these enlighten'd times, While we've of gratitude a spark, We must not let the Tallow Chandlers' light Shine in the dark. There's none that more deserve, Their fellow-citizen's applause, For they are form'd in Honour's mould, And burn in virtue's cause Tol de rol, &amp;c. Clothworkers' shall we slight you, Now that we have clear'd the cloth? Success be your's—I'm sure none here To drink it will be loth. And, while we're o'er our wine, should we The Vintner's merits pass? Such want of taste might well make us Asham'd to face the glass. Tol de rol, &amp;c. Then here's the Ironmongers' And the lasting deeds they've wrought— The city's best sheet anchor— Let us hail them as we ought! The Merchant Tailors' praise, too, It fitting is we should, For they suit every one complete— Their measures are so good. Tol de rol, &amp;c. Who to the Skinners' can deny His approbation's meed, I only this will say, Is well deserving to be flead. The Goldsmiths sterling value Has been so often tried, And pass'd current through the world, It alike is London's pride! Tol de rol, &amp;c. Fishmongers', all your generous acts, None here can e'er forget; Long may you flourish, and still find All fish that comes to net. In actions of humanity The Drapers' first we view; They feed the poor and hungry, And they clothe the naked too. Tol de rol, &amp;c Unremember'd the fair dealings Of the Grocers ne'er can be; For in all the sweets of life, They found at home are to a T. Their goodness, after dinner, Our ladies still confess, An example, sirs, so fair, That we, sure, can do no less. Tol de rol, Now, having prais'd the glorious twelve, Or made, at least, endeavour: I'll, in conclusion, hope again, They flourish may for ever!

Williams. at Vauxhall Gardens Tune—“Bartholomew Fair.” When, first, a lively boy, Ever fond of play and toy, Some of sister's borrow'd plays, Attracted first my gaze I read, and I admir'd, To stage fame I soon was fir'd, I was dying to become a tragic hero! My master vowed, at school, I was very far from fool; And the usher smirk'd about, When at breaking-up I'd spout; Pa swore 'twas monstrous fine, Ma vowed it was divine: “He born was for an actor, never fear O!” Prose text has been omitted here. Chubby cheek—voice a squeak, Squinting eye—legs awry, Head like mop—dirty chop, Hey down, ho down, derry derry down! This the first stage of an actor's life is?c ear O! As stronger grew the itching, I descended to the kitchen, And of success ne'er doubting, Next tried my hand at spouting; With table cloth for cloak, Gad I prov'd it was no joke, That I cut out was to be a tragic hero! My he met a dish cover, I a chieftain look'd all over; Armed cap-a pee, as fit, My spear a kitchen spit, My shield the dripping pan, 'Gad I then was more than man, More murders I committed, than did Nero! Prose text has been omitted here. Cookey fires—with desires, Meets while I—with passion fry; Carving knife—take your life. Hey down, ho down, derry, derry down, This an actor's second stage is, it is clear O! Now who knows but being loyal, Soon, some Theatre Royal, My talents may engage, And soon upon the stage, A hero bold in chains, I may spout my loves and pains, Playing Barbarossa, Bajazet, and Nero. How my bosom then will swell, As I hear the prompter's bell— While round goes the buz and whiz— That is he, ma'am! Yes, it is! What an eye, and what an air! Quite a Roscius, I declare! That's the gentleman—that's our new tragic hero! Prose text has been omitted here. Act away—life's a play, Let it pass—death's a farce, Youth and age,—quit the stage— Hey down, ho down, derry, derry down, This is the last stage of an actor's life, 'tis clear, O! REAL HISTORY OF JIM CROW. Written expressly for Mr. T. D. Rice, (from materials furnished by himself It was my fortune to be the medium of first introducing this Gentleman to what he facetiously—though. I dare say, unintentionally—terms the Brutish Public, in an autograph copy of instructions for a Bill of his First Appearance at the Surrey Theatre, in my possession. I told my old friend, Mr, Davidge, when he informed me of his intention to give Mr. Rice an engagement, and requested me to appeal to the Public in his behalf, that it would be either a hit or miss—that the performance was one of that singular outre description, that, like the unmeaning and vulgar expressions of “Flare up!” “Who are you?” &amp;c. if tt once took, it must for a time become what the French call the fureur, but that every thing depended upon its being properly managed—an opinion in which that most judicious Manager immediately acquiesced. The first night was properly managed, and the result justified my judgment. Both Mr. Davidge and Mr. Rice then applied to me to write an Original Piece for the Introduction of Jim Crow. I stated my doubts of any regular Drama, with that character in it, succeeding. I did not consider the representation at all a legitimate one—I will even say, a Dramatic one. Mr. Rice's talent appeared to me to be completely perse odd, out of the way, extravagant and extemporaneous—I could not conceive a Dramatist could profitably embody it. I was, however, over persuaded, and after losing much time, and spending much money, in making myself acquainted with all the humourous varieties of the American character, finished a Drama, rather to my mind, which was accordingly announced and put in rehearsal at the Surrey Theatre: but, although written by Mr. Rice's desire, and in some measure from materials furnished by himself, it would appear he felt the force of the objections I had originally urged. He complained, first, that another character was better than the one assigned to him—then, that there were some political allusions in the Piece, which were immediately struck out—with other puerile remarks, and finally backed out of the affair altogether; leaving me only my six weeks labour to repay me for all my expenditure of time and money in his behalf. Fortunately, my exertions for those intelligent and perfect American Actors, Messrs. Hackett and G. H. Hill, were rather more gratefully requited, or I might now be seated on Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen's Bench. The Song above was one of the Songs of this Piece, and was written from some of the materials I have alluded to, furnished me for that purpose by Mr. Rice himself, and which he assured me were authentic. The real Jim Crow, it appears, was a slave from Guinea, located originally in Virginia; where, through his industry, he managed to purchase his own freedom, and was engaged as a stoker, on board a steamer plying between Louisville and New Orleans. He afterwards engaged as Ostler in New York; where he attracted much attention, by making extemporary doggrel verses on everything and everybody. He was an acute and merry fellow, and gave birth to the Song that has given him such a Bartholomew Fair immortality. It is pleasant to think Mr. Rice's clever imitation of Jim's peculiarities have been rewarded as they have been. Not only has he gained an abundance of renown and money in this country, but he managed to carry away from us a rich and beautiful wife—Miss Gladstanes—and is now clearing upwards of eighty pounds a night in the States—Cousin Jonathan declaring that the approbation of the English is quite sufficient to prove him the first Actor in the World. Poor Paulo—who so admirably personated the original prototype of Jim Crow, “Billy Waters,” in my Drama of “Tom and Jerry,”—was less fortunate; as was that admirable Actor, Webster, who first sung “Jim Crow” in this Country, at the English Opera House some years ago. It is better to be born lucky than rich!) and sung at the Congratulatory Dinner of the Society of “The Crows,” Air—“Negro Melody.

From Lincoln's Inn Hall, many old suits are there, Though they're most of them rather the worse for wear and tear For silk gowns the Counsellors wait your commands, And the Lawyers have all got blue bags in their hands.

The Admirals duly look over the water, While Generals and Captains, give the petticoats no quarter; Fastly lathering away, to fill their lines quite willing, And propping up the great things, and looking very killing. And they're all washing,&amp;c. From the stockings the Stock-brokers look for their gains, While Merchants from the City, still toil o'er their counter pains; The Aldermen are over the table cloths haranguing, And the Judges are, all on the grounds, out a hanging! And they're all washing, &amp;c. For the wet-sheets, the Author and Bookseller calls, East India Directors hanker chiefly for the shawls; From the College of Physicians, half the faculty are dangling, With the heads of Surgeons' Hall, to be ready for the mangling. And they're all washing, &amp;c. O'er their irons in the fire, Speculators look arch, The Society of Friends are there too, furnishing the starch; To second all the small things, there's M. P's, as is quite proper, And directors of mines, head and ears in the copper. And they're all washing, &amp;c. Many Doctors and Apothecaries duly there you view, They prescribe their sud-rifies, and their soap-oifics too; From Duke's Place, the tribe of Israel their clothes bags in are bringing, And many a dashing belle, while fast her clapper runs, is wringing. And they're all washing,&amp;c. The Laundresses swear 'tis a tale of a tub! And declare they will give these old women a rub; That unless, by white washing, they soon get some lifts, The subscribers will quickly be put to their shifts! And they're all washing, &amp;c. “WHAT ARE YOU AT—WHAT ARE YOU AFTER?” Sung by Mr. Sloman, at Astley's, the Victoria, &amp;c. Air—‘Merrily danced the Quaker's wife’ I came to town, the other day, To rest from all my labours, And hear what cocknies had to say, That I might tell my neighbours. But all I heard, upon my word, Was this, in every quarter— Some bawling out, ‘What are you at?’ And some, ‘What are you after?’ With your tol de rol, &amp;c. At first I thought that they meant me, And cried, ‘What's that to you, sir? If you take me a rogue to be, I'll let you know who's who, sir!’ So right and left, I laid them flat, Says I, ‘You've caught a Tartar— Now go and cry, “What are you at?” And bawl, “What are you after?”’ With your tol de rol, &amp;c. But, 'cod! for constables they sent, And lugg'd me off to prison; I ax'd them, what it was they meant? They said, to stretch my wizen! They took me where the justice sat, Who gave my purse no quarter— Which made me cry, ‘What are you at?’ Good judge, ‘What are you after?’ With your tol de rol, &amp;c. Escaping from the jailor's paw, I walk'd into the Strand, sir— Where soon a charming lass I saw, None fairer in the land, sir. Says I, ‘I'll have a kiss, that's flat!’ For never lass look'd smarter; When she squall'd out. ‘What are you at? You wretch! What are you after?’ With your tol de rol, &amp;c. But while I kiss'd this pretty lass, That I the freak might rue, sir, She did my fob of gold watch rob, And pick'd my pocket, too, sir. So I went home to hang myself, From bed post, in my garter— When hostess cried, ‘What are you at? Young man, What are you after?’ With your tol de rol, &amp;c. This made me turn so very ill, I sent the doctor to, sir; He gave me blister, powder, pill, And draught, and bolus, too, sir. So, very soon, I found myself, To physic falling martyr, Which made me cry, ‘What are you at? Doctor, What are gou after?’ With your tol de rol, &amp;c. So long his bill, to Lawyer I Went, to reduce his fees, sir— But, ecod! I found the remedy, Was worse than the disease, sir. For where the lawyer sav'd a pound, He made me twenty barter, Which caus'd me cry, ‘What are you at? Oh, law! What are you after?’ With your tol de rol, &amp;c. But having now told all I saw, And lash'd 'em left and right, sir; I think I'll thank you for your law, And wish you all good night, sir— For if I longer make my strain. And urge the songster's charter, You may cry out, ‘What are you at? Singer, ‘What are you after?’ With your tol de rol, &amp;c. THE YANKEY NOTIONIST. Sung by Mr G. H. Hill, the celebrated American Comedian, at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. Air—“Paris Revels.” Though in my youth I college mist, And am no great grammarian, Yet I'm a first chop notionist, And cute Utilitarian; But that my word you may not doubt, Nor jump at my pretensions— I guess I'll just the list run out, Of my bran new inventions! Steam and gas, go slick a a-head, To all things we can' t'wixt em; Fortunes now are only made, By the High Pressure system. First, there's my bran new rail road shoes, Which have such wondrous power. They'll go wherever you may choose— One hundred miles an hour! They'll steer on active as a rocket, You'll find to them no fellows; If you've but coal enough in pocket, To urge on the impellers. Steam, and gas, &amp;c, Then, there's my cabriolet balloon, Which in a brace of courses, Will take you upon to the moon, But raise the wind for horses. Never mind what people preach, Though they my carriage run down— You'll safely terra firma reach, If properly you come down. Steam, and gas, &amp;c. Mine is the March of Intellect, Though folks may think me frantic; A suspension rail road I'll erect To cross o'er the Atlantic! A million floating capital, Expences to be bearing, My shares for their gold have they shall For it's all done by sharing. Steam, and gas, &amp;c. Then, there's my pills, that cure all ills, Each malady they rout, sir, quite— For such their power—they in an hour Will turn you inside out, right! My lozenge to stop women's tongues, I pride myself for making them; A box will stop the noisiest lungs, They can't talk while they're taking them. Steam, and gas, &amp;c. Then there's my five pow'r spinning jenny, Throws gowns off for each gay day, For thirteen pence, worth half a guinea, And makes each wench a lady. 'Tis by mechanic's I do all, The fire-grate, and the kettle; Want what you will, you've but to call My friends on Doctor Whittle. Steam, and gas, &amp;c. NEWS FROM HOME; OR, BREAKING IT OUT BY DEGREES. A Comic Duett, sung by Mr. Bedford and Mr. Buckingham, at Vauxhall Air—‘The Legacy.’ Squire. Why, who'd e'er have thought, that to town you'd have come, John— But I glad am to see you, when all's done and said. What brings you to London, and what news from home, John?John.

The Music composed by the Author, and sold by John Duncombe and Co. 10, Middle Row, Holborn. A dog, and a cat, and a cock, and a hen, And a very good looking jackass, Resolv'd, on a time, though I cannot tell when, But I know that the thing came to pass; To set up for foreign musicians, and travel Until they a fortune had made— For the jackass—no ninny—observed, Paganini, Had proved it a very good trade. Ech haw! bow, wow! tuck, tuck! mi-eau! And cock-a-doodle-doo! Sing tweedle-de-dum, and flummery hum, Upon my soul, sirs, it's all true. Oh, yes! Upon my soul, sirs, it's all true! The dog had a bass voice as low as Old Naldi's; The cat could go up very high; The hen, a beginner, chim'd in as a tenor, quite Well, as you'll find by-and-bye! The ass, a good tune, play'd upon his bassoon, And the cock blew the clarionet; When together they play'd, such a concert they made— It was one you could never forget! Ech aw. &amp;c. The jackass, a Brayham became when he sung— The cat was a great Catalani; When mewing, 'twas music that flow'd from her tongue, While the cock got great fame in Giovanni! So their farm-yard they left, and the high road pursued, Determined, at once, to begin; And to get them good houses, the dog said he would, Every night bark the audience in! Ech aw, &amp;c. Agreed, they all cried—so, until it was dark, through The country they wandered about; When it struck the jackass, that for want of an inn, They would all be obliged to sleep out. But, in searching around, they an empty house found, So snug that it made the cock sing— “We can roost here to-night, and you'll find, when 'its light, To perform in 'twill be just the thing!” Ech aw, &amp;c. But the jackass said “no,” to this vocal Ducrow, “It may serve a rehearsal or two! But excuse me for saying, dear friends, when you're Playing you'll find empty houses won't do!’ Well their concert they gave, and the empty house fill'd, For the natives flock'd in by the score— The ass bray'd, the cock crew, the hen cluck'd, the dog bark'd, The cat mew'd, and all bellow'd “Encore!” Ech aw, &amp;c. Such their fame, far and near, all their songs flock'd to hear, And so much they were deem'd to excel; The people their own native singers hissed off— Our artists alone bore the bell. And the ass, with a sneer, as they prais'd his great ear Said—“'Twas ever so, friends—let it pass— I'm not the first fine foreign singer, by scores, That in truth has been but a jackass.” Ech aw, &amp;c. They the rage so became, with each fine-fangled dame, To admire them was thought such gentility. Their money to save, soon their concerts they gave, In the houses of all the nobility. When loaded with wealth, they return'd 'twas by stealth, To their own native plains, where now snug, With signor, and monsieur, they at Johnny Bull sneer, And his passion for foreign humbug! THE FIDDLELESS DANCING MASTER! Sung by Mr. J. Russell, in the “Strand-ed Actor.” [The singing of this Song is usually prefaced, for the better understanding of it, by the following remarks. A country Dancing Master, going to give a lesson to a young lady, unfortunately lost, or mislaid his fiddle. What to do he knew not—his pupil could not dance without music, and music there was none, except he could make some. He therefore bethought himself of the expedient of substituting a vocal for the instrumental accompaniment, and accordingly sung the tune to which the young lady's steps were to be regulated; but as he had continually to keep giving directions, and yet could not leave off singing, he was obliged to set them to music, and make them form a part of the harmony; the ludicrous effect of which may be more easily conceived than told by the singing of the following imitation.] Air—‘Hey for the life of a Soldier’ Fal lal—Curtsy dear miss, if you please, Tol de rol lol lol—not too low; Ti tum—mind how you bend your knees— Whack fal diddle dal—now then go! Tol de rol lol lol—hold up your head, Ri tum tiddle tum—point your toe; Zounds! you don't mind a word I've said, Fal lal—how can you blunder so? Tooral looral—don't you see?

God bless him.’ Most folks give their sentiments after their songs, But I cannot say that is my tether; To part heart and harmony sure must be wrong, Song and sentiment I join together: So at once in a song I'll my sentiments give, Sure you'll all approve what I am giving— Here's “The Queen, Heaven bless her, and long may she live, With “Old England, the land that we live in!” Then here's “Lovely Woman!—each man will drink that, For in each care and ill she'll relieve him; “Sweet home” for though homely, 'tis home for all that, With a “Friend, and a bottle to give him.” Here's “May honour, and honesty never decline,” 'Tis the wish of my heart, I assure ye; “May justice and mercy for ever entwine,” With our glorious “Trial by Jury.” “May the moment now present, of life be the worst,” “May the honest heart ne'er know distress;” “May we have in our arms, what in heart we love first;” “All those that bless us may we bless.” “A good trade, and well paid;” which ensures “peace and plenty,” “Honest men, pretty women,” for ever! “Play houses full, and Workhouses empty,” And “May worth and want finally sever.” Here's “The heart that can feel for another's distress,” And “The man that was never ungrateful;” Here's “May we the smiles of good humour possess, With friends around, cheerful and faithful.” Here's “Our old wooden walls” that still lay our foes flat, With those treasures, “Wives, Children, and Friends;” Here's “Our own noble selves” and now having drank that Here my song of good sentiment ends. PUNCH'S OPERA. Sung by Mr. J. Russell, Mr. Ellar, &amp;c. &amp;c. Air—‘Bartholomew Fair.’ Hark! don't you hear the horn? As sure as you are born They are bringing Mr. Punch, With his belly and his hunch! Yes, attracted by the noise, See the little girls and boys, All crowding to behold him, in a bunch here! Now, they stop, Stand they drop, Bugle sounds, Crowd surrounds— Man gets in, To begin! I can't see, What's that to me? Mind my toes— Oh, my nose! Prose text has been omitted here. Hey down—oh down, derry derry down, Oh, bravo! what a hero's Mr. Punch, sir! Prose text has been omitted here. I shall knock you hey down, &amp;c. Now all is fun and noise, Loud shout the little boys The girls prick up their ears, Mr. Punch, again appears! Hark! be's calling for his horse, 'Tis brought to him of course— An appetite to get him for his lunch, oh Now gavotting, See, he's trotting— Now, he canters, Jokes, and banters— In the saddle, Mounts a straddle— Takes the reins, Then with pains— Hark! that groan, Sure he's thrown! Prose text has been omitted here. Hey down! ho down—derry derry down! What a wonderful hero's Mr, Punch, sir! Hey down, ho down, &amp;c. But now the ends in view, You'll find 'tis very true, For they're coming with the hat, None can sure object to that. See, they've brought Punch to the gallows, Who hardened seems and callous— Though a chokey-pear they are swearing he shall munch, sir. Cap and rope, Little hope— Mister Ketch, Neck to stretch; Parson soothing, Dance on nothing— Ticklish touch Drop too much, Though they tell him he in paradise will lunch, sir. Prose text has been omitted here. Hey down, &amp;c. LONDON ADULTERATIONS: OR, ROGUES IN GRAIN. &amp;c. Sung by Mr. Sloman, at Astley's Amphitheatre. Air—‘Dennis Brulgruddery’ London tradesmen, 'tis plain, at no roguery stop, They adulterate all they've in warehouse and shop! You must buy what they sell, and they'll sell what they please, For they would, if they could, sell the moon for green cheese. Sing tantarantara, what rogues. Imitation, 'tis well known, is now all the rage, Every thing imitated is, in this rare age; Tea, Coffee, Beer, Butter, Gin, Milk—and in brief, No doubt they'll soon imitate mutton and beef. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. The Grocer sells ash leaves and sloe leaves for tea, Ting'd with Dutch pink and verdigris just like Bohea. What Sloe poison means, sirs, I quickly found out, We shall to a T soon be poison'd, no doubt. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c Other Grocers for pepper sell trash call'd P.D: And burnt horse-beans for Coffee—how can such things be? Now I really do think, those who make such a slip, And treat us like horses, deserve a horsewhip! Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. The Milkman, although he is honest he vows, Milks his pump night and morn, quite as oft as his cows; Claps you plenty of chalk in your score—what a bilk? And, egad, claps you plenty of chalk in your milk. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. The Baker will swear all his bread's made of flour, But just mention alum, you'll make him turn sour; His ground bunes and pebbles turn men skin and bone, We ask him for bread, and he gives us a stone. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. The Butcher puffs up his tough mutton for lamb, And oft for South-down sells an old mountain ram; Bleeds poor worn-out cows, to pass off for white veal, For which he deserves to die by his own steel. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. A slippery rogue is the Cheesemonger, zounds! For with kitchen-stuff oft he his butter compounds; His fresh eggs are laid over the water, we know, For which, faith! he over the water should go. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. The Brewer a Chemist is, that is quite clear, For we soon find no hops have hopp'd into his beer; 'Stead of malt he from drugs brews his porter and swipes, So no wonder that we have so oft the drug-gripes. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. The Tobacconist smokes us with short cut of weeds, And finds his returns of such trash still succeeds; With snuff of ground-glass and dust oft we are gull'd, And for serving our noses so, his should be pull'd. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. The Wine-merchant that we abroad may not roam, With sloe-juice and brandy makes our Port at home: The Distillers their gin have with vitrol fill'd, So 'tis clear they're in roguery double distill'd. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. Thus we rogues have in in-grain and in tea too, that's clear, But don't think I suppose we have any rogues here; Present company's always excepted you know, So wishing all rogues their deserts, I must go. Sing tantarantara, &amp;c. A SONG ON PAPER. Sung by the Author at the Surrey Beef Steak Club. Air—‘Bow wow.’ A learned sage, some years ago, when writing on mankind, sirs To sheets of papers that are blank, compared the infant mind, sirs; On which as growing sense dictates, or fate decrees their lot, sirs, Virtue writes fair characters, or vice imparts a blot, sirs. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. The thought was happy—I'll pursue it—(that is with your leave, sirs, To make you laugh, which you will do, if 'tis but in your sleeves, sirs; There's various sorts of paper, as of men, and prove it I can, sirs, Each sort of paper, somehow, represents some sort of man, sirs. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. Your Lords and nobles that so grand in stars and garters vapour, What are they, take them all in all, but merely emboss'd paper; More fit for shew than use—while rich men, 'self call'd our betters, Are but gilt paper, not in common given, sirs, to letters. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. The lower-orders, labourers, and mechanics,and so forth, sirs, Are coarse brown paper, but for all that, still they have their worth, sirs; They're strong, our goods they hold secure, although to feed our pride, sirs, As on we journey through life's road in parcels they're outside, sirs. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. Your beaux's are tissue paper—a fine, but flimsy race, sir, Which next to beauteous objects to prevent set off, we place, sirs. Your Lawyer is brief paper, and as many one atleges, Is full of rules, likes cutting close, that is, about the edges! Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. Our lovely maidens, young and chaste, and innocently sweet, sirs, The best white paper are, each one a pure unsullied sheet, sirs; On which the happy man whom fate to call his own ordains, sirs; Can write his name, and blest for life, may take her for his pains, sirs. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. What are our modern scribblers? though they foul on me may fall, sirs, Why, take both those who're read, and those who are not read at all, sirs; They and their works believe me, in the same class you find, sirs, Clapp'd on the shelf, and but the mere waste paper of mankind, sirs. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c, The Soldier's cartridge paper, in honour's cause enroll'd, sirs, The Statesman is post paper, and alike is bought and sold, sirs; Your Prude she is touch paper, that a spark pretends to fear, sirs, While the Drunkard's blotting paper, that drinks up all it comes near, sirs. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. Psalm singers paper are in quires, and some in reams have been, sirs, Your Glutton is pot paper, whose small water mark's scarce seen, sirs; And the crowd of silly fellows, who delight the world to blame, sirs, While there's such a thing as foolscap paper, want no other name, sirs, Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. Your Bankers are note paper, and oft to some amount, sirs, Although according to their stock, they're sometimes at discount, sirs; Your Gambler is card paper, and by Cobbet we are told, sirs, There's no such real gambling as paper against gold, sirs. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. Emperors are Imperial paper, oft with ambition fill'd, sirs, Whom John Bull keeps in boards cut to demy, and has well mill'd, sir; Victoria's royal paper, and though Dan O'Connell frown, sirs, And try to dissolve the Union, will ne'er yield to double crown, sirs. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. Actors copy paper are, for our play wrights just the caper, And the London actors, artists all have prov'd they're drawing paper; As for me I'm tracing paper, that don't wish to offend, sirs, And should say more about paper, but my paper's at an end, sirs. Bow, wow, wow, &amp;c. CHAPTER OF SLANG. Sung by Mr. J. Reeve, at the Adelphi Theatre. Air—‘Oh, what a day.’ Oh what a change, all England now are slanging it, High and low, and middle classes, studying close— Poets now write nothing else, while orators harangue in it, Poor Doctor Johnson's nose put out of joint by Captain Grose. So classic, comprehensive, so comic, and so terse it is, Old Oxford, aye, and Cambridge, too, all at their universities, Have buried the dead languages, which once taey were so pat in To study prime St. Giles's Greek, and bark out rum dog latin. Prose text has been omitted here. Oh, what a change, &amp;c. Slang the current language is, with gentry and mobility, Their mother tongue they patter it—the pedant's frown defy, The higher classes boast they're up, and young sprigs of nobility, Roses, pinks, and tulips, now are regularly fly; While Dusty Bob and Afric Sal don't stand upon gentility, But swear they're down, and leery coves with just the same facility: And as your Toms and Jerrys on their sprees larks, rambles, pass his way, Old watchey swears that he's awake, and knows full well the time of day. Prose text has been omitted here. Oh, what a change, &amp;c. Your citizens say they're not green—that they've not come from Tooley Stret, The sportsman that he knows an oss for harness or for hunt, The soldier boasts, of milling hosts, and flooring foes where're they meet, Stock brokers prate of bulls and bears, lame ducks, and lots of blunt. Young ladies study fancy works, and with their ogles flash away, In hopes too hook some nob that they may lead the ton and dash away, No grammer-schools, like hammer-schools, and he must be a ninny-hammer, Who cannot hammer flash in him, and patter it without a grammer, Prose text has been omitted here. Oh, what a change, &amp;c. THE TONGO ISLANDS. Sung by Mr. T. P. Cooke. I sail'd from port one summer's day, And for the South Seas made my way, But got wreck'd in No Bottom Bay, All on the Tongo Islands, The King he made a chief of me, His name was Koreekankikee— We got as thick as we could be, And every night drank strong bohea; Says he, ‘You shall be my son in-law, And marry the Princess Washy Taw—’ Says I, ‘Your majesty, hold your jaw! I will accept the Princess Paw— With her tuzzy muzzy, hoki poki, Hunky nunky, roki boki, Pulka wulka, joki koki, All in the Tongo Islands. My bride was fair, as you'll suppose, She wore a feather through her nose, And had some rings upon her toes, The pride of the Tongo Islands. A mat she'd for a petticoat, And a string of scalps wore round her throat, For she'd kill'd fifty chiefs of note, And did upon a battle doat— Our wedding-feast description flogs, 'Twas in a palace built of logs— We'd yam and blubber, and twelve bak'd hogs, And, by way of a dainty, some roasted dogs— With our tuzzy, &amp;c. A most accomplish'd wife was she, And we lived in great harmony, 'Till the chiefs they jealous grew of me, All in the Tongo Islands. They swore they'd cut me up like pork, And eat me without knife or fork— Thinks I, why this is precious work, And off my body I'd better walk, So one fine morn, to show my wit, Not being ready for the spit, To cut and run I did think fit, Thus, 'stead of biting, they were bit, And their tuzzy, &amp;c. I'd at my wedding store of guests, I'd lots of princes, chiefs, and priests, Who gutted like so many beasts, All in the Tongo Islands. There was the mighty Kangalore, And Whangalore and Pinafore, And Battledore and Bullyroar, And Bandalore and forty more The King, he drank three quarts of rum, Which sowed him up—he was so dumb, We thought he'd gone to kingdom come. Which made the Queen look precious glum— But after we had tweaked his nose, He quickly jump'd upon his toes, And floored us, just as we were foes, All in the Tongo Islands. Now here once more I'm safe and sound, Thank Heaven! on Old England's ground, And never more will I be found, All in the Tongo Islands. For what's the use of being chief, Where we can't mutton get, and beef, Nor a can of grog to give relief, When out of spirits and in grief. Although the lawyers here we dread, That cut us up alive, 'tis said— Yet there they knock you on the head, And swallow you after you are dead! So, give me England, still, d'ye see— In spite of taxes—for we're free; The devil himself may go for me, All in the Tongo Islands. INNS FOR OUTS. Written Extempore, and sung by the Author, at a Meeting of the Licensed Victuallers Charity. Dame Nature orders wisely still, That each content may win; For every Jack there is a Jill, For every out an inn. They're reckoning ‘without their Host,’ Who slight the Vintner's aid, For Hospitality's his toast, And welcome is his trade. With them all classes find a port, To succour, licensed all, And rich and poor alike resort, Inviting great and small. The King unto the Woolsack goes, The Noble to the Crown, The Gentry tipple 'neath the Rose, The Plough attraets the Clown. The Doctor hurries to the Spade, The Sexton to the Shovel— The Parson seeks the Mitre's aid, The Lawyer likes the Devil. Our Herve's to the Duke's Head hie, The Olive Branch each scorns; The Ladies to the Feathers fly, The Cit unto the Horns. The Soldier marches to the Gun, The Shepherd to the Lamb, While Cobler's to the Sot's Hole run, And Paviors' to the Ram, Our Travellers to the World's End stalk Our Topers to the Flaggon, Good Women to the Phœnix walk, And bad ones to the Dragon. The Proctor likes the Fox and Geese, Tax-gatherers the Boar— The hungry Bailiff seeks the Fleece, Where the landlord's been before. The Beadle on the Bear and Staff Will never turn his back, The Cooper at the Tun will quaff— The Pedlar seeks the Pack. As Shenstone says, all, who life's round Have trod, whate'er the scene— Must own, with joy, they still have found A welcome at an Inn. There 'tis clear, beyond a doubt, That all a home may win— There is an Inn for every out— For every out an Inn. MURPHY HATH A WEATHER EYE! A favourite Comic Meteorological Song, sung with tempestuous approbation by Mr. Hammond. Air—Norah Creina, or Lesbia hath a beaming eye. Murphy hath a weather eye, He can tell, whene'er he pleases, Whether 'twill be wet or dry, When 'twill thaw, and when it freezes. To the stars he has been up, Higher than the Alps high summits, Invited by the moon to sup With her, the planets, and the comets. Murphy hath, &amp;c. Murphy hath an Almanack, From which we every day can gather— He has such a happy knack, What will really be the weather. He knows how to raise the wind, Hold the rains, have hail at pleasure— Get in the sun when he's a mind, And blow a cloud whene'er he's leisure. Murphy hath, &amp;c. Murphy can the world eclipse, Can light the sun, if he should fail, sirs— At Venus nightly lick his lips, And pull the Great Bear by the tail, sirs. He the quicksilver knocks about, Nor ever asks what there's to pay, sirs— Don't let his mother know he's out, But drinks tea in the Milky Way, sirs. Murphy hath, &amp;c. Murphy knows the Zodiac's signs, Virgo long hath been his virgin: With her he's Gemini, the Twins, Old Capricorn his passion urging. He with the Bull is quite at home— The Fishes in the scales can carry— Whene'er Aquarius reigns won't roam, But with the Ram still plays Old Harry. Murphy hath, &amp;c. Francis Moore is now no more— Murphy is his undertaker, And soon we may the loss deplore Of every umbrella maker, As all now know when 'twill be wet— The doctors will look monstrous funny, For very soon we shall not get A cough or cold for love or money. Murphy hath, &amp;c. Murphy is so weather wise, He'll to a stand bring hackney coaches— The jarvies will all bless his eyes, And cads breathe nothing but reproaches. No General Frost will put to flight Great generals now, from Rome and Paris; No army will set out to fight, 'Till Murphy hath declar'd it fair is. Murphy hath, &amp;c. Murphy knows each wind of old, And, like a Lapland witch can sell it— And, when by chance 'tis very cold, He at his fingers end can tell it. And though he sometimes is at fault, Yet from this what can we gather? If it don't rain when it ought, 'Tis not his fault, 'tis the weather. Murphy hath, &amp;c. A flesh and blood barometer, (His quicksilver by us provided;) The sun our sole gasometer, Will be if we're by Murphy guided, No corns must now presume to shoot, Nor cat its left ear dare wash over, For what will their prognostics boot? 'Tis Murphy now must all discover. Murphy hath, &amp;c. Murphy is an M. N. S. Which Member means of No Society; For, living ou the air, he is A Man of Natural Sobriety. My meteorlogy to end, May we long happy live together, With Mr. Murphy for our friend, To tell us all about the weather. Murphy hath, &amp;c. PARISH POLITICS. Sung by Mr. Conquest at the Garrick Theatre. Air—The Pedlar's Song in ‘Oscar and Malvina.’ Now peace upon us deigns to smile, And plenty cheers the people, And virtuous counsels from our isle, Still far, thank Heaven, keep ill! Who thinks of this or t'other state, Or cares for foreign nations, When every parish is as great. And o'er Assessment, Tax, and Rate, Still boasts as great orations. Domestic jars, and foreign wars, Are now grown rather rarish, But ne'er will end their politics, When gravely met the rates to fix, The vestry of our parish. Prose text has been omitted here. Domestic jars and foreign wars Are now grown rather rarish, But ne'er will end their politics, When gravely met the rates to fix, The vestry of our parish. Who for our Commons cares a groat, Or heeds the Congress clatter, While parish vestries claim each thought, They're German to the matter. The House of Represenaatives May send their friendly greetings, So, too, may France's deputies— But what are every one of these Compared to parish meetings. Prose text has been omitted here. Domestic jars, &amp;c. Saint Stephens used to bear the bell For chaff and prittle prattle, And e'en the Lords would once excel In noble tittle tattle. But what, to parish orators, Are these, but merely rabble? From Greece and Rome they win the palm— Demosthenes they all out-storm, And Cicero out-gabble! Prose text has been omitted here. Domestic jars, and foreign wars, &amp;c. THE ROYAL VISIT; OR, LONDON'S WELCOME TO QUEEN VICTORIA. A Loyal Civic Medley, sung by Mr. Fitzwilliam, Mr. C. Taylor, &amp;c. at the City Dinners. Air—Sure such a day. Oh, what a town, what a wonderful metropolis, Such a town as London town was surely never seen; Such a noise of girls and boys, and such a merry populace, For Gog and Magog loyally have entertain'd the Queen. The Companies, to show their zeal, themselves form'd in monopolies— All the nation's population were with joy obstropolis, For search the earth, of all who've birth, Victoria, sure, worth treble is, Oh, what a town, what a wonderful metropolis, London town most loyally has entertain'd the Queen. Air—When Arthur first in court began. Victoria sought the Common Hall, To grace the civic chair, And dined with those most worthy men, The Sheriffs and the Mayor. The Mayor she made a baronet— Thrice happy was his lot— And both the Sheriffs, too, she knights, They all are Sirs, Cod wot! Air—Bartholomew Fair. In bustle, Neighbour John His bran new wig put on, With coat and waistcoat gay, To grace that happy day— For such another reign He ne'er may see again, As the happy reign, The reign of Queen Victoria! Air—Liberty Hall. To famous Guildhall did they proudly invite Our Queen, bright Victoria, Great Britain's delight! In public to dine with the city's new lord, While loyalty, plenty, both garnish the board. Air—Chapter of Kings. Our Henrys and Edwards, they feasted of yore, Elizabeth—Ann, too—with dainties great store, And our Georges the bell from all monarchs that bore, But they vow for Victoria they'd do ten times more, For barring all pother, 'bout this, that, and t'other, They were all entertained in their turn. Air—Lord Mayor's Day. There were four-and-twenty carriages, all of a row, Four and-twenty maids of honour, all of a row— With horsemen and footmen, drummers and mummers, Trumpeters, beefeaters—nobility, mobility, Little boys, full of noise—men and women, girls and piemen, And all the houses and churches filled with people, From the garrets and the steeple—jolly fellows—to the cellars—down below! To see the Queen go to Guildhall, to eat, and to make merry. Air—Roast beef of Old England. Roast beef in its glory, the Englishman's fare, Proudly smoked on the board—famed Sir Loin, too, was there, With the Baron, to make all the Aldermen stare— Oh, the roast beef of Old England, Oh, the Old English roast beef! Air—Alderman's Thumb. Oh, 'twas merry in the Hall, For the chins wagg'd all; Such a noise, and such a din, As they cut through thick and thin, Ham and fowls, and soups and fish, Lots of every dainty dish. Cut me this, and cut me that, Send me crust, and send me fat. Tit bits—pulling, hauling— Legs, wings, breast, head! Some for liquor scolding, bawling— Hock, Port, White, Red! All was cramming, cutting, slashing, Ducks and geese, and gravy splushing, Till all was done. Air—A health to the King, God bless him. In a bumper of Burgundy, filled to the brink, Or in Claret, or Hock, or Champagne; For not a soul there from the glad toast would shrink, Though they ne'er drank a bumper again. London drank to her glory, her hope, and her joy, Wishing no woe or care might distress her, But plenty and peace banish far each annoy, They drank health to the Queen, God bless her! Air—Here's a health to all good lasses. Yes to her, who all surpasses, Her, the queen of all good lasses, To Victoria, in full glasses, They the glorious toast sent round. All good lasses, in a bumper, Glad it passes, in a thumper— Wishing all a life of pleasure, Without mixture, without measure, For in them true joy is found. Air—God save the Queen. God save our youthful Queen, Long live our youthful Queen, God save the Queen! THE WONDERFUL SKITTLE-PLAYER! Sung by the Author at the Surrey Beef Steak Club. Air—Derry down. Baron Bowlemdowndingsdorff, as old legends say, In Amsterdam lived, and played skittles all day, With Mynheer Rollempolem, the idlest of lubbers, But those who at bowls play, will sometimes get rubbers. Derry down, &amp;c. And the Baron once catching Mynheer playing foul, Knocked him straight on the head, in a rage, with a bowl. For which, as none could again set up the sinner, The Baron was ordered a chop for his dinner. Derry down, &amp;c. I'm content, he exclaimed, but one boon grant me, pray, Ere my head on the block, like a blockhead, I lay; On the scaffold, at skittles a game let me win, I shall die quite content—I shall not care a pin. Derry down, &amp;c. Agreed! cried the judge. Well, the fatal day came, When the Baron was brought out to play his last game. On the scaffold the skittles and axe were both ready, With a gallon of Hollands, just to keep his hand steady. Derry down, &amp;c. Jack Ketch set the pins up, the Sheriff kept count, 'Twas settled a score was to be the amount: Said the Baron, said he— ‘'Till 'tis one by the clock, I shall play for my life, stake my head 'gainst the block.’ Derry down, &amp;c. Well, he played with great glee, forgetting, poor elf! That the next dead man down might, alas! be himself— When the holy friar, who was quite tired of staying, Said, 'tis clear to be seen for his life he is playing. Derry down, &amp;c. The Sheriff, too, thinking he would never give o'er— For he still kept exclaiming, ‘Another bowl more!’ Here whispered Jack Ketch, who stood close at their backs, ‘When next he stoops down make sharp work with your axe.’ Derry down, &amp;c. To cut short my tale, Jack obeyed the command, And the poor Baron soon had his head in his hand— For, rising up quick, to see what had occurred, He took his own head for the bowl, 'pou my word. Derry down, &amp;c. Though somewhat confused, as you'll guess, by his loss, At the skittles he threw it with wonderful force; When all nine falling down, so correct was the aim, The head holloa'd out, ‘Damme, I've won the game!’ Derry down, &amp;c. THE KENTUCKIAN! Sung by Mr. Hackett. Air—Original. I've just come from Kentucky, 'Mongst the Shakes, in the far West— Where, when I cut my lucky, All the bears they made a feast; For up the bee tree, in the cane, I'd hunted them to kill; And none had ever winked again, Had I not had my fill. Raise the steam, and go a-head! Toss off a sling for luck— Put on the gas from the main pipe, In praise of Old Kentuck. My father he was bosen's mate To Commodore Paul Jones, And he left me a large estate— 'Twas all in paving stone. I'm a genooine Backwood man, And when I'm out of prog, To prove that I'm a good man, I can eat a hickory log. Raise the steam, &amp;c. I'm half horse, half alligator, Half a snapping turtle, too— I can fairly beat all natur, For there's nothing I can't do. I am all made up of brimstone, Except my ears and head; And they are aquafortis, On which I for pap was fed, Raise the steam, &amp;c. I don't stand on a trifle, But still go the entire hog; I've the closest shooting ride, And I sport the best coon dog. I've got the biggest ticker, And the toughest racking horse, And I can kill more lickar, And more varments, too, in course. Raise the steam, &amp;c. I've got the prettiest sister, And any man may have her; They'll be sorry who have missed her, For, like me, she's a rip staver. I weigh my weight in wild cats, Can a panther grin to death— Hug a bear too close for comfort, So I'll bark while I have breath. Raise the steam, &amp;c. I can wade the Missisippi, And can jump the Ohio; In a tub can, in a jiffy, Up the Niagara go I ride on a streak of lightning, And a thunderbolt can catch, And in cooling off a foreigner, I never had my match. Raise the steam, &amp;c. I member am of Congress, A full major, and a judge; And, moreover, a bear hunter, Who was never known to judge, By scores the scalping Ingins To eternity I've hurled— The yaller flower of the forest, The beauty of the world. Raise the steam, and go a-head, And take a sling for luck: The gas must from the main be laid, In praise of Old Kentuck! THE COMPOSER REHEARSING A SONG. A Buffo Scena, sung by Master Burke at the Surrey Theatre. Air.—Original. [Blewitt.] RECITATIVE. 'Tis done! completed is the score, Now, with the Band, I'll try it o'er. Who a composer's joys can tell, When with the Band his song goes well? Who picture a composer's pains, When wretched fiddlers mar his strains? Now ‘Mr. Leader—sir in C? Andante time—take it from me. [Beats time.] Tutti—together—one strong chord— [Chord.] Bravo! delightful, on my word. Now violino obligato— [Violin solo.] Non troppo presto, moderato! Cantabile—this is the style. [Imitation.] There's a bar missing—rest awhile. [Pause.] Now, then, I'll try it with my voice— I ne'er wrote anything so choice! [A false chord in the orchestra.] Zounds, what a bull—do mind your cue— [Horns.] There's five bars rest, there, Horns, for you. Now, gentlemen, in common time, For that best suits the Author's rhyme. I must begin, or all 'twill mar, Jnst as you close the second bar. I'll count the time, you follow me— Now—one, two, three, four—one, two, three! SONG. Air—Away with melancholy. Oh, music, art enchanting, Sweet zest of every joy, There's nought, if thou art wanting, In life, but soon will cloy— Without thy soft charm granting, Our pleasures but annoy. RECITATIVE. Zounds, music's wanting here, that's clear— Oh, this would make an angel swear! Trombone, you're a note too flat— Fagotti—zounds, what are you at Corni, the time completely mars— All's wrong—try back the last eight bars! SONG. Oh, music, art enchanting— RECITATIVE. I do not hear the basso's there! SONG. [Continued.] Sweet zest of every joy! RECITATIVE. Zounds, piccolo! do take more care SONG. [Continued.] There'a nought, if thou art wanting, In life, but soon will cloy! RECITATIVE. Now, Coda—forte—drums, be ready— Fortissimo—Cymballo, steady! Now— CODA—SONG. [Continued.] Music, its charms ne'er granting, Our pleasures but annoy! (Bis.) RECITATIVE. Bravo! Thanks, gentlemen—all's right! We'll get on famously at night. THE DELIGHTS OF NEWGATE! Sung by Mr. John Reeve at the Adelphi Theatre. Air—There was a bold Baker. I'll sing you a song about Newgate, brave boys, Ri tol li tol li tol diddle dol. Those who rail against Newgate don't know half its joys, Ri tol li tol li tol diddle dol! Board, lodging, and washing for nothing we boast, And servants provided at Government cost. Ri tol, &amp;c. In Newgate we've nothing to bother our lives, Ri tol, &amp;c. We're none of us troubled with children or wives, Ri tol, &amp;c. And three times a week, 'twould be rude to decline— The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs invite us to dine. Ri tol, &amp;c. A place more convenient, boys, who could desire? Ri tol, &amp;c. We none of us, here, are in danger of fire, Ri tol, &amp;c. Such care's taken of us, by Stone and his elves, That no one insures, no not even themselves. Ri tol, &amp;c. In Newgate, boys, thanks to our honest friend Jack, Ri tol, &amp;c. None of our companions we're sure will hang back— Ri tol, &amp;c. And 'tis pleasure to think, that while here we may stop, It has cellars can always supply us a drop. Ri tol, &amp;c. The best judges often come here, for depend, Ri tol, &amp;c. All that's bad must, in Newgate, at last find an end, Ri tol, &amp;c. And as to the ladies, 'tis just to their mind, When to Newgate they come, they're all of them confined Ri tol, &amp;c. Then we've doctors here will, when we're at our last kick, Ri tol, &amp;c. Put us out of our pain, without fee, very quick, Ri tol, &amp;c. And when forc'd to take leave, such our wish to remain, We all work very hard till we get back again. Ri tol, &amp;c. CHAPTER OF CLOAKS. Sung by Mr. C. Taylor at Vauxhall, &amp;c. Air—Derry down When I came to town lately, I found, 'tis no joke, Young and old men and women, all wearing a cloak, So, thinks I, I will e'en do as other folks do, To be in the fashion I'll have a cloak, too. Derry down, &amp;c. Why not? for I'll prove, in the course of life's pother, We all of us wear a cloak sometime or other; For there's none but must own, in the midst of their pride, They have something 'tis sometimes convenient to hide. Derry down, &amp;c. The Dandy, en militaire, still wears his cloak, And thinks a cigar 'tis the tippy to smoke; Of his fine frill and broaches he makes a great show, But take off his cloak, 'tis all dicky, you know. Derry down, &amp;c. Young Miss with her beauty spots, rouge, airs, and graces, In the hood of her cloak often carries two faces; Her Lover still swears she's an angel uncommon, Till she throws off her cloak, when he finds she's a woman. Derry down, &amp;c. The Lover, till wed, seems to court beauty's sway, And swears he but lives her commands to obey. But once tightly noosed in the conjugal yoke, 'Tis, ‘Do this, and do that, ma am!’ for off goes the cloak. Derry down, &amp;c. The Lawyer a cloak wears as well as the Lover, So many old suits he has always to cover; His cloak once thrown off shews a great deal of evil, For 'stead of the Lawyer, oh, dear! there's the Devil! Derry down, &amp;c. The Wine Merchant, now finding cloaks all the go. To follow the fashion by no means is sloe— When he once gets in Port, his superiors to ape, He soon shews us his cloak has got plenty of Cape. Derry down, &amp;c. The Patriot that he is honest declares, And 'gainst places aed pensions most lustily swears— But offer a little gold trimming and lace, The cloak is thrown off, but we find there it's place! Derry down, &amp;c. The Maids wear a cloak, too, when the men they disparage— Call Cupid a monster, and rail against marriage— Swear a single life's bliss, and of husbands make joke, Till Mr. Wright seen is, when off goes the cloak. Derry down, &amp;c. The Doctor a very black cloak indeed carries, A wooden surtout, in which all faults he buries— Long, long may he keep his cloak all to himself, For 'tis one I'd for ever have laid on the shelf. Derry down, &amp;c. The Statesman a cloak wears when giving his vote. He finds it so handy to hide a turned coat— In short, we have all of us cloaks in our houses, And wanting them, wives oft make cloaks of their spouses. Derry down, &amp;c. Now that all sometimes wear a cloak, having prov'd true, I'll throw off my cloak—I must have none with you— Believe me in zeal and obedience still fervent, Your grateful devoted, and most humble servant. Derry down, &amp;c. THE SEASON OF THE YEAR. The Writer first heard the old part of this Song sung at a small road-side public-house, in the little village of Lillishul, Warwickshire, aud was so pleased with the humour and melody of it, that he was induced to add half a dozen new verses to it. This is the first time it has appeared in a complete state. Sung by Mr. Rayner, and the late Mr. R. Sherwin, Mr. John Reeve, and others, at the different London Theatres. Air—Old Country Melody.

Oh, 'twas, &amp;c.

Oh, 'twas, &amp;c.

Oh, 'twas, &amp;c. Then here's success to powching, For I does think it vair— And here's look to ere a gentleman Az wants to buy a heere. Bad look to ere a game keepoor, Az woona zell his deere.

Sung by Mr. John Reeve, at the Adelphi Theatre. Air—Mail Coach. When winter's nearly over, And summer comes in clover, From the “George and Blue Boar” the folks start; The men of wit and treasure, Cits and wits, to take their pleasure, All for Bath, in a hurry, depart. Cramm'd, snugly, in their places, The tits fast in their traces, While coachee smirks, our favour to curry— The wheels they loudly rattle, The passengers they prattle, And all is noise and hurry scurry, flurry! Hurry scurry, flight and flurry, To Bath, dear Bath, we hurry, To keep soul and body alive. At Bath, now, stretching, yawning, Till it is twelve in the morning, Their pleasure at length is complete; Then the folks their pins are moving, And the joys of Bath they're proving, Messrs. Tag, Rag, and Bobtail they meet. To the Pump Room then they're hasting, The waters to be tasting, Where everything is quickly set in motion— Then in the hot bath dipping, Steaming, stewing, scalding, dripping, Men and women mix, and bathe in fond devotion. Prose text has been omitted here. Hurry scurry, &amp;c. Then to morning concerts hasting, The charms of music tasting, Between each song we laugh and joke so funny; And at two the Loo we're shuffling, At the libraries we're raffling, Where we lose, alike, our tempers and our money. With an appetite for dinner, That we mayn't grow any thinner, To fish, and flesh, and fowl we're homewards prancing, Till the gay assembly finding, The day we up are winding, With cakes, with cards, with negus, scan mag, dancing. Prose text has been omitted here. Hurry scurry, flight and flurry, To Bath, dear Bath, we hurry, To keep soul and body alive. MEDLEY LIFE OF GIOVANNI. Sung by Mrs, Fitzwilliam, at the Adelphi Theatre. Air—Love's young dream. How sweet my life, each beauty bright, Lur'd me to rove; And my song of joy, from morn till night, Was love, still love! On all I smiled, Each heart beguiled With song, and dance, and play; I never met a woman's scorn, They ne'er said nay, For in leap year 'twas I was born, On Lady Day! Air—A lady in Seville's fair city. I born was in Seville's gay city, And soon fell in love very deep; On my Spanish guitar play'd a ditty, And lull'd the old guardians to sleep, With hoo tira lira la, &amp;c. Air—The Bold Dragoon. There was a charming fair, and she lov'd a bold young man, Her father was a commandant—her name was Donna Ann— I saw and loved, the spirit moved, I stole, at night, with flute and fiddle, When out the commandant came, With his long sword, saddle, bridle— Whack went his truncheon,— Faith, mine didn't long lay idle; Whack down I knock'd him dead, And then away I ran. Air—All in the Downs. All in the Downs the fleet lay moor'd, I for my life flew like the wind— I hailed a boat, and got on board, The constables they loudly bawl'd behind. Tell us, ye jovial sailors, tell us true, If Don Giovanni sails among your crew. Air—Bay of Biscay. Loud roared the dreadful thunder— The boat on shore was cast— I saved my life by wonder— Some sailors' wives sail'd past. One kiss'd me as I lay— Her husband came that way, Whom, with his gun I kill'd, then run From the Bay of Biscay, O! Air—Fanny was in the grove. Zerlina was in the grove, Masetto, her boy, was nigh: They married, but not for love, So just in the nick popp'd I! Oh, oh—fondly and warmly I sigh'd— Oh, oh—you may judge yourself if she denied. Air—Haydn's Surprise. Gaily shone the banquet board, Circled round by beauties rare, When strait some heavy steps I heard— Leporello, see who's there. Grim stalked in the commandant— ‘I've come—(said he)—repent, be wise, And go with me.’ Said I, ‘I shan't!’ ‘I'll take you, then, said he, Don, by surprise’ Air—Peas upon a trencher. I passed my life in wooing, In watching and pursuing The light that lies, In woman's eyes, And that 'twas proved my ruin. When priest and parson sought me, I scorned the heaven they taught me— My only bliss Was woman's kiss, That to the devil brought me! Air—Newgate Melody. Which makes me to lament and say, Pity my fall, You young women all, Well-a-day! well-a-day! BOOKS AND BIPEDS! Sung by the Author at the Surry Beef Steak Club. Air—Bow wow wow. Human Nature's a large library, We 're each a volume in it; Some good, some bad, some hard to be made out, Some few well read. Kind Heaven the Author is of all, Which none can doubt a minute, When we are born we're published, And we're out of print when dead. A Soldier is a red book, And a Parson is a prayer book, A Lawyer's a black letter book, Producing lots of pelf; A Cuckold is a horn book, An honest man is a rare book— Actors, books in parts, And old Maids, works upon the shelf. Pretty women have good frontispieces, Scolds are full of matter— Young maids are books in nonpareil, And Scriveners, in vellum— Blacklegs they are piracies, Rogues, books fraught with errata, And Patriots very good books, You so soon can buy and sell 'em. Dwarfs, books in duodeeimo, And Giants, books in folio— Drunkards books in quarto, Which wet from the Press appear— Our Veterans books with cuts, While an Author is an olio, And Mistresses are almanacs, That changed are every year! Old Bachelors odd volumes are, Lying lumbering about— Widows, volumes second hand, That sometimes go off best. Doctors, books in the dead languages, That oft a drug turn out— Our Courtiers they are spelling books, While Spendthrifts are hot pressed. A Proctor is a testament, A Bishop is a bible— Surgeons are Reviewers, Cutting up ten where they save one; A good man is a sermon, A Liar is a libel— A merry man 's a jest book, And a Sexton is a grave one. Clowns volumes are in foolscap, And Kings in royal crown— Placemen work in post— And Cooks in pot ne'er bettered: Lords are books in capitals, That still command the town— Our wealthy men all gilt are, While our learned men are lettered. Old misers are in marble bound— Fops volumes are in calf— Mechanics books in boards, that we Pick up in stalls and streets; Our married men are whole bound, Our single men but half— Spinsters they all stitched are— While a bride's a work in sheets. Bankers they are books with notes, And cash books, worth much money. Arithmeticians, works in numbers Many folks take in. Wives are childrens books, and children, Nursery books—'tis funny— While Judges, they are statute books— Great antidotes to sin. A coquette is a riddle book, And flirts are every day books— Antiquarians old books, And coxcombs most absurd books— Schoolmasters are grammar books, And idle folks are play books— Hypocrites are hymn books, And scolding wives are word books. Thus Bipeds plainly are but books, If rightly understood— Human nature but a Library, As has before been said, And Heaven's the Author of us all— In all there is some good— When we are born we're published, And we're out of print when dead! CUPID'S COOKERY BOOK. Sung with universal applause by Mr. G. Ford and Mr. J. W. Sharp. Music, by Auber, sold by Duncombe and Moon, 17, High Holborn All you who love feasts, at which Hymen is cook, A receipt take from “Cupid's Own Cookery Book.” If a match you would make, you will find this the plan— Catch a young gent and lady, as fresh as you can. Let the young gent be raw and soft, though the male gender, And take care the young lady is equally tender. To dinner the gentleman set down to table, And pour as much wine in as ever you're able— And, whilst he is soaking—attend, pray, to this— Every now and then pop in a word about Miss, But do it with care, or the match you may spoil, And you'll find he'll be very soon ready to boil. The moment your gent in the gills becomes red, See, poor fellow, he's into the drawing-room led— Set him down by the lady, though shy he may be, And sop them both equally well with green tea— Lead them to the piano—the handiest of things— And blow up the flame till the young lady sings— But the first sigh you hear the young gentleman puff, Take them off, for they then will be both warm enough. Put them then by themselves—they'll not think you presume— In the most retired corner there is in the room, Or else on a sofa, tete a tete, the pair leave, And there let them simmer the rest of the eve. Two or three times, successive this plan must be tried, Taking care that the parties are placed side by side, And you'll find this a truth is—deny it you can't— They'll be ready for marriage whenever you want. After marriage, more care you must take than before, As 'tis known they are very apt then to turn sour. The honeymoon o'er, and departed the zest, Howe'er well and tasty they both may be dress'd. Attend to these hints, and a match you may make, Whene'er to dish one up the pains you may take. A receipt for which vain you'll in Mrs. Glass look, As it's copied from “Cupid's Own Cookery Book.” THE DEVIL'S TOUR! Medley Song, sung by Mr. Russell at the Surrey Theatre. As onwards through Chaos I hurried in haste, O'er Europe's sunny plains I passed— To Spain's romantic land I came, And a sadness seized my Demon frame, For I saw, beneath the olive shade, A vision fair of a dark eyed maid, Who sang with a joy that seem'd proof 'gainst woe, To her lover's guitar, the Bolero so! Air—Vestris's Bolero. Hence doubt, and fear, and anguish, No more my heart shall languish, Love, Hope, and Joy are mine! And I said to myself, 'tis no place for me, When I saw—and it fill'd my heart with glee— The Fiends of the Inquisition near: They came like night and things of fear. They tortured the maid—gave the youth to the flame, And it all was done in Religion's name. Oh ho! quoth I, there's no want of me— My trade's going on right merrily! To Italy then, inspired by Hope, I went to visit my friend, the Pope. His sons seem'd happy—their Barcaroles Echoed the music of their souls. No breeze but bore a healing balm— The azure skies beam'd joy and calm, When I heard, amidst the linden trees, The mountain song of the Tyrolese. Air—Rossini's Tyrolienne. At close of day, with joyous glee, We sport and play, from sorrow free. Oh, then we'll sing wild songs, While echo still the strain prolongs, Till night its dusky veil, Sheds o'er hill and dale! But soon, to wake me from this dream, I saw the assassin's stiletto gleam! I saw this sunny and joyous land, The abode of the dark and fierce Brigand! I saw the Austrian Eagle stoop, And a harvest seize at one fell swoop! So I hurried away, and shriek'd with glee— ‘My trade's going on in Italy!” As I flew o'er the fertile fields of France, Sweet scene of melody and dance. I saw the despot's iron hand Stretch'd forth, to crush his native land— And I saw—it made my bosom glow— The blood of her sons, like water flow— Till I heard, amidst her maidens' cries, The indignant hymn of freedom rise. Air—Marseillaise Hymn. Sons of Freedom, wake to glory! See what myriads bid you rise! Your children, wives, and grandsires hoary— Behold their tears, and hear their cries! My heart grew sick, as the evening breeze Bore the patriot sound to the Thuilleries And I saw, in the dark and murky hour, A monarch flee from a people's power! Says I 'tis a lesson for Demons and Kings, So I took the hint, and order'd my wings— For well I know where there's Liberty, That never can be the place for me! THE GOOD OLD ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN. Air—Old English Melody. We've. young and old, all lately heard revived the good old rhyme Of the Good Old English Gentleman that lov'd the olden time— And since old subjects please so well, it sure can't be a crime With the good old English Lady's worth to make a pleasant chime. The good old English Gentlewoman Of the olden time! The heiress of a good old house, embosomed 'mongst the rooks, The good old tenants, as they pass'd, all bless'd her comely looks— She learnt to write the good old way, with hangers and pot hooks, And though no wondrous scholar, yet she was the best of cooks! Was the good Old English Gentlewoman Of the olden time! The good old housewifery to study with the sun she'd rise, And got by heart the good old way of making puddings—pies! Preserves and pickles, jellies, jams, and home-made wines, likewise! Old salves and plaisters for old hurts, which made her quite a prize! The good Old Englishwoman Of the olden time! She'd all the old accomplishments within herself combin'd— Work'd samplers—play'd the harpsichord—could sing, too, when inclined— Danc'd Minuets—although she own'd that much more to her mind Were the good old Country Dances, when a hundred couples join'd! The good Old English Gentlewoman Of the olden time! With good old hoops and stomachers she dignified her carriage— The good old customs she kept up of courting and of marriage— The caudle and the christening—which let no one disparage— With one-and-twenty children, too—for she liv'd to a rare age— The good old English Gentlewoman Of the olden time! She did not long survive her good old Lord when 'neath the mould, But made her will, and calmly died, and 'tis with pleasure told, 'Mongst many a good old charity she freely shared her gold, And left her good old name to be encreased a hundred fold— The good Old English Gentlewoman Of thè olden time! ALL WHEN THE LEAVES WERE GREEN. Sung by Mr. Rayner. Air—Old Country Melody. I was a brisk and sprightly lad—a very merry boy— My mother's hope, my father's pride—nought could my rest destroy— The neighbours all admired—I was the pride of every scene, At wake, or fair, or harvest home, all when the leaves were green! Then Health was mine, and Wealth was mine, and all my heart desir'd— The pretty girls all flock'd around—with love my soul was fired. I chose out one from all the rest, she was my bosom's queen— I kiss'd and woo'd her, day and night, all when the leaves were green! I kept my horse, I ran my dogs, was at all in the ring, I hunted, betted, sported, gam'd—but time was on the wing I took my glass, I kiss'd my lass, sought joy from morn till e'en, Nor ever dreamt I should grow old, all when the leaves were green! Now here I am in prison laid, exposed to want and scorn— My friends have fled, my Love is dead, and I am left forlorn. I pass each day in grief away, nought variegates the scene, Except to think upon the time all when the leaves were green! All you, like me, when young and gay, and friends and fortune smile, Don't think it will for ever last, nor let the world beguile— Beware of want, look out for woe—ingratitude bites keen— Remember Winter time will come, although the leaves be green! KISSES! The Celebrated Chanson D'Amour, originally sung by Madame Vestris in ‘Giovanni in London’ at Drury Lane Theatre, &amp;c. Now First Printed entire. Air—Chanson D'Amour. I gave her kisses one, Half afraid, half afraid— I gave her kisses one, half afraid— I gave her kisses one, She frown'd and cried ‘Have done!’ But ‘go on!’ her pretty blue eyes plainly said I gave her kisses two, Bolder grown, bolder grown— I gave her kisses two, bolder grown. I gave her kisses two, She lisp'd, ‘Be quiet, do! Will you never learn to leave a maid alone?’ I gave her kisses three Wondrous sly, woundrous sly— I gave her kisses three, wondrous sly— I gave her kisses three, When she return'd them me, And I read a world of love within her eye. I gave her kisses four, As you'll guess, as you'll guess— I gave her kisses four, as you'll guess, I gave her kisses four, She look'd like wishing more— And depend upon it I wish'd nothing less I gave her kisses five— Can you blame, can you blame? I gave her kisses five, can you blame? I gave her kisses five— 'Tis as true as I'm alive— You in my place had surely done the same, I gave her kisses six, Going on, going on— I gave her kisses six, going on— I gave her kisses six, She sigh'd, ‘Are these your tricks? I fear you are a wicked creature, Don!’ I gave her kisses seven, Quick as thought, quick as thought— I gave her kisses seven, quick as thought— I gave her kisses seven, She murmur'd, ‘I'm in Heaven!’ Said I, ‘My Love, so every Angel ought!’ I gave her kisses eight, In a breath, in a breath, I gave her kisses eight, in a breath— I gave her kisses eight, Quoth she, ‘I yield to fate! I'm yours, my dear Giovanni, yours till death!’ I gave her kisses nine, Who but me, who but me— I gave her kisses nine, who but me? I gave her kisses nine, Her lips were so divine, They honey, manna, nectar, seem'd to be! I gave her kisses ten, With much zest, with great zest— I gave her kisses ten, with much zest. I gave her kisses ten, She call'd me ‘best of men!’ But there surely is no need to tell the rest! LIFE AND OPINIONS OF JIM ALONG JOSE. Sung by Mr. Conquest with unbounded applause. Written in 1845.

Vide Royal Declaration to the Privy Council, 1839. Arranged by the Author to a Favourite Air of Millico. Maidens, maidens! haste and get married, Hymen's in fashion—he's coming to Court— Soon you will think that too long you have tarried, Is it not leap year? At nothing stop short. Crown then your wishes—stay not for majority— Pop the question at once, if you feel Cupid's dart: Be ‘loving Subjects’—you've Royal Authority! Own the empire of passion and reign in the heart! Maidens, maidens &amp;c. Think for yourselves, girls—your friends and relations Make Privy Counsellors—tell them your mind— Do as your Queen's done—whatever their stations, Boldly declare you're for wedlock inclin'd! Whatever dull Parties say to the contrary, Make the youth of your fancy the Prince of your choice— To wed's Constitutional—maids, then, don't tarry, Uphold your just rights, 'twill the nation rejoice. Maidens, maidens, &amp;c. Plainly tell them, if they should kick up any clatter— Evince opposition—your wishes condemn— That, as bound, you have duly considered the matter, And think 'twill be best both for you and for them. That you've no doubt at all, if the fates are propitious, Your own private happiness it will secure— Your domestic enjoyments make doubly delicious, And be very grateful to them, you are sure! Maidens, maidens, &amp;c. Tell them you thought fit to acquaint them all early, That none may say they've taken been by surprise— And doubt not, like our Queen, whom we prize so sincerely, That to all ‘loving subjects’ 'twill seem very wise. Do this girls, at once—to young Cupid sing “Gloria!” And make up your minds to ‘Obey, Honour, Love!’ Every maiden will then be as blest as Victoria, While each chosen youth a Prince Albert will prove. Maidens, maidens, &amp;c. MR. AND MRS. RAILTON. A COMIC CONJUGAL DUET, Sung by the late Mr. W. H. Williams &amp; Mrs. Fitzwilliam at Publi Concerts. Air—The Bold Dragoon. Mr. R. Why, Molly! Mrs. Railton! Where the devil are you all? Pray are you deaf or dead, that thus you let me call and bawl? I've broke the bell! One might as well, live in a desert, or a common, And spend one's life without a wife, as live with such a shocking woman! Zounds! I can't bear it! If there's not a reformation, I'll the house turn out of doors, or 'faith I'll leave the nation! Mrs. R. Well, Mr. Railton, here I am! What's all this noise about? Do you think I've wings, that I can fly the moment you call out? I'm quite a slave—I'm sure the grave were better than to lead this life, sir! Such calling, tearing, bawling, swearing—I curse the hour I was a wife, sir! All you can wish for, is brought you, without asking for it, Yet, all my thanks is, abuse, neglect and worrit! Mr. R. 'Tis false! I use you. Ma'am, too well—but we'll this moment part! I wish in church, I'd in the lurch left you, with all my heart. The roast and boil'd are always spoil'd—I never get a decent dinner— The poultry's old—the greens are cold—Yes, but you don't grow any thinner.Mr. R. Zounds—But I won't swear. You'd better let your tongue lay idle! Mrs. R. Sir, you're a great bear! You'd best your temper bridle! Mrs. R. In spite of all your slander I most cause have for complaint.Mr. R. You've not!Mrs. R. I have!Mr. R. 'Tis false!Mrs. R. 'Tis true!Mr. R. It is!Mrs. R. No, sir, it ain't!Mr. R. Have you forgot—I hope you've not—in church you promis'd to obey, Ma'am?Mrs. R. Obey! Absurd! I skipp'd the word—Mr. R. You'll find you won't get off that way, Ma'am! No, to a summons, from Doctors' Commons, you'll knock under. I'll enforce, Ma'am—a divorce, ma'am—Mrs. R. Indeed! I shouldn't wonder! Mrs. R. You wicked man, is this your plan? Abusing 'stead of soothing? You rake at nights, you slight my rights, get tipsy, and do nothing! There's Brown and Moore, and half a score, you think your Friends—that never come, sir, But 'tis to feast at your expense, and drink you out of house and home, sir! But Mr. R., sir—once for all I give you warning, I'll no longer sit up—till three, sir, in the morning! Mr. R. And haven't you your cronies, too—which one that's blind can see. Must come for something else than merely for a dish of tea! There's Mrs. Bowles, blows up the coals, and Mrs. Jones, who deals in scandal— And Mrs. Knagg, whose curs'd red rag, still serves the Devil for a handle— And as to drinking, ma'am, please just give me leave to hint, ma'am, Some folks don't dislike, in sly, a drop of peppermint, ma'am! Mrs. R. A letter came the other day—ungrateful man, you know it— From one no better than she should be, for you dared not show it! But I'll find out what 'twas about, and tear her eyes out to distress you.Mr. R. Will you be quiet? Zounds, this riot! Curse me, but I've a mind to dress you!Mrs. R. Hum! what, you'd strike me?Mr. R. If I thrash'd you, I assure ye, ‘Sarve you right!’ would quickly be the verdict of the Jury! Mr. R Then if you come to letters, Ma'am—you have your peccadilloes— And if I romp it with the girls, you flirt it with the fellows! And from your winks to Mr. Jinke, last Sunday, I am very certain, That something wrong might chance, ere long to happen, ma'am, behind the curtain. But I'll act timely. I'll send you, madam to your mother!Mrs. R. Then, sir, you'll have to talk with Captain Biggs, my brother! Mrs R. You cruel brute! you see my tears—you play upon my love— I'll have a separate maintenance, and where I like I'll rove.Mr. R. Hum! Tears? Don't cry. Perhaps, Ma'am, I said something more than I intended I did but jest, so let it rest—you know least said is soonest mended?Mrs. R. Jest?Mr. R. Yes!Mrs. R. Oh, Mr. R.!Mr. R. Oh, Mrs. R.! Enchantress!Mrs. R. Rover!Mr. R. My life!Mrs. R. My love!Mr. R. My duck!Mrs. R. My dove!Mr. R. One kiss— [He kisses her.]Both. There—now all's over! MUNDEN'S CHAPTER OF BENEFITS. Sung by the late Mr. Munden at Drury Lane Theatre. Many chapters I've read of folks, fashions, and Kings, Sights, pockets, and other like everyday things— But of Chapters there's none half so proper, that's clear, As to read o'er my Chapter of Benefits, here. Derry down, &amp;c. My first was, when long in the country I've stump'd Up to town with ‘The Farmer,’ brisk lemmy, I jump'd— And straight through ‘The Turnpike Gate’ merrily pass'd, Where still I've remain'd your Crack man to the last. Derry down, &amp;c. ‘Sprigs of Laurel’ I gather'd in Nipperkin next, Nor felt in the high ‘Road to Ruin’ perplex'd. As Old Dornton, the Banker, I urg'd Nature's cause, And drew immense Drafts on the public applause, Derry down, &amp;c. We very well know ‘Every one has his Fault,’ But as Harmony often I made anger halt— I have met with my ‘Rivals,’ but, say what they will, In Sir Anthony, faith, I was Absolute still I Derry down, &amp;c. The brisk ‘Busy Body’ my fame next advances— I gave public favour a Gripe in Sir Francis— And in serving the public, I truly can say, I a great Busy body have proved to this day. Derry down, &amp;c. In ‘Speed the Plough’ Able and Handy I prov'd, As from project to project I merrily rov'd— I invented a new plan to pleasure the town, And reap'd a rich harvest of wealth and renown! Derry down, &amp;c. In a ‘Cure for the Heart Ache’ I rapidly rose, And cured many sad hearts, I trust of their woes— As Old Rapid, the Tailor, I made a new suit For the Public—and gain'd cash and custom to boot. Derry down, &amp;c. Still Watchful in ‘Past Ten o'clock’ for your ease, As Old Dozey I proved I awake was to please— Yes, night after night to my post I was true, Till at last in Sam Dabbs you found out ‘Who was Who?’ Derry down, &amp;c. But though I've through so many characters past, There's one that will stick to me still to the last— It is, as I hope, many here fully know, Your obliged, your devoted, your constant friend, Joe. Derry down, &amp;c. LEAP YEAR! OR, THE LADIES' PRIVILEGE. Sung by Miss Vincent, at the Surrey Theatre. Ladies, Ladies, 'tis Leap Year! your privilege ply— For etiquette now you no longer need stop: All you who have swains that are bashful and shy, May court, if you please—nay, the question may pop! Prose text has been omitted here. Who woos in Leap Year—pray remark it, ye Fair— Through life may the badge of supremacy wear! Court, court, Ladies, court! you can't woo in vain— A few tears, a few sighs, and you'll anything do. In spite of themselves bestow bliss on each swain— You have but to flatter—they'll soon buckle to. Prose text has been omitted here. For who woos in Leap Year—pray remark it ye Fair— Through life will the badge of supremacy wear! Be bold—squeeze their hands—they'll not take it amiss— But vow you are dying, they'll find you new life, Nay, e'en should you venture on stealing a kiss, 'Twill but the more surely of maids make a wife! Prose text has been omitted here. THE ROYAL MARRIAGE. A LOYAL COMIC EPITHALAMIC MEDLEY, Sung by Mr. Fitzwilliam at the Grand Civic Banquet given at the Town Hall, Windsor, in honour of the Nuptials of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria with H. R. H. Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg Gotha, on Monday, February 10th, 1840. Air—Sure such a day. Hail, happy day! so auspicious to the nation— Such a day, so bless'd and gay, was surely never seen. England pour'd her thousands forth, in festive celebration, To hail with hand and heart the marriage of our Queen! Long may we meet in bright commemoration Of that most happy union, that high solemnization, Of all our brightest, fondest hopes the joyous consummation— Then let us in the genial glass drink our congratulation! Hail, happy day, &amp;c. Air—Haste to the Wedding. In haste to the wedding there flock'd friends and neighbours, For who would the bliss of the lovers delay? They forgot all their sorrows, their cares and their labours, And bade ev'ry heart beat with rapture that day. True Englishmen all, this their general call, May they revel in pleasures that never can cloy— Be their's royal felicity— May they love and happiness ever enjoy! Air—Fie, let us a' to the bridal. To pay homage due at the Bridal, Did Foreign Ambassadors come— Our own Nobles, too, were not idle, But hasten'd to grace every room. Lords in Waiting, Bridemaids, Maids of Honour— Bishops, Judges in solemn array, All went to invoke blessings on her, And see their Queen given away. There never was sure such a Bridal— Dukes, Ministers, Statesmen were there— All parties acknowledg'd one idol, And call'd blessings down on the pair. Air—Woo'd and married and a.' Woo'd and married and all, Woo'd and married and all: The happiest they of all mortals, When woo'd and married and all! Air—Ah, sure a pair. Ah, sure a pair were never seen So justly form'd to meet by Nature, As loved Victoria, England's Queen, Excelling still in form and feature. And Albert, chosen of her heart— The first in ev'ry manly duty— Thus may true love still crown desert, And Princely worth still cherish beauty. Air—Merry are the bells. Merry were the bells, and merry did they ring, And we as merry are as they, and merrily we'll sing— May Cupid ring the changes with Hymen's Treble Royal Bob Majors, as he ranges for now to love is loyal. Air—Plain Gold Ring. For though a Queen the first on earth, He but a Prince by rank and worth, She deem'd a plain gold ring from him Well purchased with a diadem. She rightly chose—a nation's prayer— Then bless, kind fate, our throne still save With daughters as Victoria fair, And sons, as Albert true and brave. Air—Bridemaid's Chorus. For them a bridal wreath entwine— Yes, those whom Concord sweet has join'd— To grace and bless a Royal line, And gently lull each thought unkind. Be their's long life, unmingled peace and joy— Each blessing may they ever find, And nought with them love's charm destroy. Air—Yankee Doodle. Scorn the fates, and change your states, You who've single tarried— Your Queen a fair example sets, So hasten and get married! And married folks, you're not forbid To follow her example— Love but your wives as first you did, And you'll have pleasures ample. Yes, young and old, for once be bold— You'll not in vain endeavour— Or great, or small, get married all, 'Tis better late than never! Air—Long live the Queen! Hail! all hail our much loved Queen And Albert! shout, wake plain and green— Ne'er were pair more noble seen, Long live the Queen! Fenc'd round by patriot hearts, No danger need they dread— Fell faction backward starts, And hides abash'd its head! All hail, our loved Victoria And Albert, hail! Their glory, Their names shall shine for ever, Renown'd in regal story! Hail, Albert and Victoria! Our cherish'd Prince and Queen! All hail, our Prince! All hail, our Queen! All hail, our Prince! All hail, our Queen! All hail our Prince and Queen! THE JOCKEY. A Celebrated Sporting Song, sung by the late Mr. Mathews in his Entertainment with rapturous applause. Air—Epsom Races, or Waltz in ‘La Dame Blanche.’ Of all the lads upon the turf, so wide awake, so knowing, There's no one like the Jockey—up to everything that's going. His sire, the Coachman—Cook, his dam—he owns no Groom for brother— Earth had been two-fold bless'd, indeed, had it foaled such another. Just fifteen hands upon his feet, and next grass twenty rising— So tight and clean—sound wind and limb—the Ladies' hearts surprising. Prose text has been omitted here. Here they come, and there they go—'tis done, undone, and done! Two to one, till the heat is run, and the race is lost and won! Life's a chance, and fortune favours still the bold in courting, Then while I live the odds I'll give, there's pleasure still in sporting. Who'll win or lose a toss up is. A hundred years pass'd over 'Twill all the same be with the game—then let us live in clover. So up and down, so wing and fly, so knowing and so clever, Let me a jockey live and die—a jockey's life for ever! Prose text has been omitted here. Here they come, and there they go—'tis done, undone and done— Two to one the heat is run—the race is lost and won. THE JOLLY GOOD FELLOW. SONG AND CHORUS. Music sold by Duncombe and Moon, 17, Holborn Hill. SOLO. Here's a health to the friend at our side— A health to the lov'd and the true— Our playmate in boyhood, in manhood our pride, The health that is justly his due. He is good, he is merry and wise— He is brave, he is honest and true— He is honour'd for Honour, in every one's eyes— Here's his health—it is justly his due. CHORUS. For he's a jolly good fellow— For he's a hearty good fellow— For he's a thorough good fellow— Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah And so say all of us— And so say all of us! For he's a jolly good fellow— For he's a hearty good fellow— For he's a thorough good fellow— Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! May health and prosperity long be his lot, All his heart's fondest hopes realiz'd— May each blessing of life, kindred, children, and wife, Circle round one so lov'd, and so priz'd. He is good, he is merry and wise, He is brave, he is honest, and true, He is honour'd for Honour, in every one's eyes. Then his health, boys, 'tis justly his due! For he's a jolly, &amp;c. Upstanding, uncover'd, we'll drink it with three! No heeltaps, but bumpers—drink high! Now, boys, are all charg'd? You will take it from me— With full honours this toast we'll drain dry. Here's a health to the merry and wise— Here's a health to the honest and true— Here's a health to the friend that we've tried, that we've priz'd— The health that is justly his due. CHORUS. For he's a jolly good fellow— For he's a hearty good fellow— For he's a thorough good fellow! Hip hip hip hurrah! Hip hip hip hurrah! Hip hip hip hurrah! For he's a jolly good fellow— For he's a hearty good fellow— For he's a thorough good fellow? Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! THE CRUEL COURTSHIP. Air—Oh, Cruel. Oh, cruel 'tis unlov'd to live, yet cruel is Love's smart— Oh, cruel has Love been to me, and broke my tender heart The fair sex all great cheats have prov'd, and foil' my hopes of bliss— I never made a hit but once, and that turn'd out a miss! Oh, cruel was my first love, and barbarous to boot, For when I ask'd her for her hand, she handed me her foot. Perhaps 'twas right to hide her love, and blush at all my prayers— But what the devil good was there in kicking me down stairs? Oh, cruel was my second love, who'd ten pounds in the Stocks, And cruelly she snared me, in her cruel auburn locks. I took the shears and cut a curl, but stared like any pig, When she cried, “You cruel puppy! curse you, you have spoil'd my wig!” And cruel was my third love, who went with me to church, But at the cruel door was forced to leave me in the lurch— By six cruel children, ready made, who claim'd her pots and pans, And a cruel Irish husband, who bawl'd, “I forbid the banns!” And cruel was my last love, who said she'd marry me If veiled, to spare her blushes, I would let her wedded be: But when the marriage was performed, with a cruel lot of bother, Unveil'd, and shewed me I had wed her cruel old grandmother! Oh, cruel was the Clerk that gave her to me for a wife, And cruel was the Parson, that made her mine for life And cruel were the Marrowbones, that clang'd such merry knells, And I wish the ropes were round their necks that rung the cruel Bells. THE COUNTY COURT, OR, COBBLERS' CHANCERY. Sung by the late Mr. W. H. Williams, Mr. Buckingham, &amp;c. at the Theatres, Concerts, and other Places of Public Amusement, with universal applause. Air—Go to the Devil and shake yourself. County Courts of Request are Courts much in request' For so swiftly and surely they practice law's game' That though Madame Justice is blind, 'tis confess'd, Yet no one with justice can say she is lame. There they've causes that no effects often produce— Though they often effects get without any cause— And laws without conscience—but that has its use— For sometimes they've conscience without any laws. Prose text has been omitted here. She as sweet is as Sugar And like I should to hug her— But find me a rhyme for Porringer, And I'll give you, for an Orange, her. County Courts of Request, are Courts much in request, For so swiftly and surely they practise Law's game, That though Madam Justice is blind 'tis confest, Yet no one with justice can say she is lame. County Courts of Request, oh, they free are to all— The Cobbler his Chancery finds them to boot— The Plaintiff, Defendant, all keep up the ball, They the Bookseller bind, while the Tailor they suit. There you may be Witness, and Counsel yourself— You may plead if you please, and your cause is soon tried: While all parties laugh o'er their matters of pelf, The losers excepted—who laugh the wrong side. Prose text has been omitted here. Now, Buggins, stand back, And Kittywhack, pray hold your clack! Your debt is one pound ten, my lad, To which twelve shillings costs we add— Give it us, you'll find it best— The County Court makes this request. Kittywhack. But Justice, my Lord— His Honour. In vain of Justice here you talk, Give us the money, sir, and walk! County Courts of Request, &amp;c. Prose text has been omitted here. His Honour. Hum! this is a very ticklish case, And would puzzle a Judge in another place. Well, I shall give you a verdict in verse, Which I shall make very terse. Stand forward, Mrs. Mc.Ginnis, and pay attention to the Court. She made a shift to spoil your sheet, ne'er doubt it So you must make a shift to do without it— A light supper, too, she got you, as you said, So she must pay you nothing, and you'll be lightly paid! Clear the Court! County Courts, &amp;c. THE FAST MAN! Air—The Cork Leg. Of the Dutchman's fast Cork Leg they've told, And the Fast Steam Arm of the Soldier bold— But a story I will now unfold Of a faster than either these heroes old! With a tooral looral, &amp;c. Jack Highfly was so very fast, That both these worthies he surpass'd— 'Tis true he had in haste been cast, But he'd fifty-tramp power to the last! With a tooral looral, &amp;c. His sire—to whom he was mos dear— Left him, 'tis said, ten thousand clear— Which, without staying to shed a tear, He got through in a single year! With his tooral looral, &amp;c. Fine lodgings had Jack all about town, With a lady gay, his bliss to crown— The Bank of Englond he could have knock'd down, For fastness he had such renown! With a tooral looral, &amp;c. When his tailor to patronise Jack chose, He always order'd twelve suits of clothes— Though he didn't with Snip stop, you'll suppose, But order'd as many hats, boots, and hose! With a tooral looral, &amp;c. Drink more than any one, Jack could— Any quantity given from bottle or wood— When it wasn't his own—but that's understood— So a four bottle man he was still held good! With a tooral looral, &amp;c. You may believe that the truth I tell, When I say he outran the Constable— For running in debt he was own'd to excel— He head over ears still ran so well! With a tooral looral, &amp;c. It was always high pressure—a time of need— But his ‘steam up’ Jack run at the top of his speed— And having no check rein, was sure to succeed, For Anti Attrition was never his creed. With a tooral looral, &amp;c. But this Railroad pace—though quite the thing When on business or pleasure we wish to take wing, The Man Locomotive don't suit, Poets sing, The Coal burnt, and low water mark, at the spring! With a tooral looral, &amp;c. The Bailiffs to nab Jack, vainly ran— From Monday, when the week began— For the Artful Dodge was still Jack's plan— And they swore they ne'er follow'd so fast a man! With a tooral looral, &amp;c. Jack lived so fast that his race he'd run Long ere he had reach'd twenty-one! Yet he lived forty years did this son of a gun— For he turn'd nights to days. Now my song it is done. With a tooral, looral, &amp;c. MORAL. But lest at my muse you should stand aghast, A Moral I'll draw that must not be past. Highflyers beware, if you'd wish to last, And take care that you do not live quite so Fast! With a tooral looral, &amp;c.

A CONVIVIAL SONG, Sung by Several Distinguished Amateurs at all the Fashionable Parties, &amp;c. in the Season of the Year. Air—Poacher's Song. A Carol! come, a carol, boys! in honour of good cheer, For still good fare will banish care, make sorrow disappear— And dearer is this merry time, the more 'tis bleak and drear— Oh, a Christmas night, it is my delight, in the season of the year. What beeves will bleed, that we may feed! What flocks for us will die! What turkeys fall, that one and all may revel plenteously! Then higher, higher heap the fire—till the logs burn bright and clear— For a Christmas night, it is my delight, in the season of the year. Fill up the wassail bowl, with spicy wine unto the brim, And let goodwill and peace to all upon its surface swim— And drink a merry Christmas, and as happy a New Year, For a Christmas night, it is my delight, in the season of the year. Roast well the apples and the crab—prepare the toast and ale— And let the social Lamb's Wool pass, with catch, and song, and tale, Till close unto the ribs it clings, the weary heart to cheer— Oh, a Christmas night, it is my delight in the season of the year! Mincc Pie! it hath a magic sound—Plum Pudding's a charmed name— And we've Snap Dragon—ever found a very mystic game. The fiery ordeal we must pass to win the sweet and dear— Oh, a Christmas night it is my delight, in the season of the year!

And pleasant looks the Misletoe, when hung up as a snare, While the laughing girls stand by and cry ‘Come, kiss me, if you dare!’ For they can struggle, scream, and scratch, while kiss'd they're being there— Oh, a Christmas night, it is my delight, in the season of the year! 'Tis sweet to be awaken'd in the pauses of the night, By the merry Waits, awaking too, the echoes of delight. Like fairy melodies they steal upon the drowsy ear— Oh, a Christmas night, it is my delight, in the season of the year! What though Old Christmas brings its bills, to them no thought we'll give, For though we may have some to pay, we've others to receive. Then let us think but of receipts, which still the bosom cheer— Oh, a Christmas night, it is my delight, in the season of the year! Then welcome, Merry Christmas! for thou com'st but once a year! Success attend that jolly heart that still will make good cheer— But ill betide that churlish wight, that thinks a thing too dear— For a Christmas night, it is my delight, in the season of the year! WE WON'T GO HOME TILL THE MORNING. A COMIC SONG. Air—Marlbrook. We won't go home till the morning In the orient sky is dawning, We won't go home till the morning, Until it is break of day. We'll banish care and sorrow, And business till to-morrow— We'll sing old songs and snatches, Blithe glees and merry catches And hear the chimes at midnight, So cheerily, cheerily play! CHORUS. We won't go home till the morning In the orient sky is dawning— We won't go home till the morning, Until it is break of day! We'll drink off bumper glasses, And toast our fav'rite lasses, Nor care how quick time passes, Nor how long he may stay! We've lost the lov'd, the near— We've seen depart the dear— Yet age has not so chill'd us, Nor with indiff'rence fill'd us, But we'll hear the chimes at midnight, For once, come what, come may! We won't go home, &amp;c. THE ROYAL LORD MAYOR'S DAY OR, THE CITY'S WELCOME TO THE PRINCE OF WALES. Sung at the Civic Banquet, Guildhall, with great applause. Air—Lord Mayor's Day.

When the ragamuffins wanted to be bounceable Each a hero! Mob at Zero! Greece and Rome! Beat at home! Hey down, ho down, derry derry down, Whou wouldn't be a Special Constable? Prose text has been omitted here. Hey down, ho down, derry derry down Oh Lord, who wouldn't be a Special Constable! A baton of command, Entrusted to one's hand, Authoris'd to break a head, With that instrument of dread, And from all assistance claim In Her Majesty's own name, Officially I take up all who're trounceable, Peace, I say— Clear the way— Guard the Crown— Knock you down! Hey down, ho down, derry derry down, Oh, Lord, who wouldn't be a Special Constable? Prose text has been omitted here. Hey down, ho down, derry derry down, Oh, Lord! who wouldn't be a Special Constable! The Soldiers and Police, Would in vain have kept the peace, If they hadn't had the aid, Of us truly great unpaid, The Nation's greatest power, As we showed in danger's hour, With authority that was quite unpronounceable. Demonstration— Glorious station— Saving all, From a fall! Hey down, ho down, derry derry down, What a fine thing 'tis to be a Special Constable! Prose text has been omitted here. Hey down, ho down, derry derry down, What a fine thing 'tis to be a Special Constable! The facts forming the subject of this Song actually occurred at the time in a small town in Scotland. HEAVY WET, MUTTON CHOPS, AND CHERRY BOUNCE! The popular Three Part Parody on ‘Cherry Ripe,’ sung by Mr. J. Reeve at the Adelphi Theatre. &amp;c. HEAVY WET. Heavy wet, heavy wet, still I cry! Pints and quart pots, when I'm dry— If so be you ask me where They are best, I answer, there— Where we most can run in debt— That's the place for heavy wet! Heavy wet, heavy wet, still I cry! Meux's, Whitbread's, nought care I— To the Blue Posts let us go, There we'll clouds of backy blow— And, while we our cares forget, Every day quaff heavy wet. MUTTON CHOPS. Mutton chops, mutton chops, I cry! Fat or lean ones, both I'll buy— If so be you'd have my coin, You must cut them off the loin! When the cook for nothing stops, That's the time for mutton chops. Mutton chops, mutton chops, chops, I cry! I as hungry am as dry— Let me have them nice and hot, With a murphy and shalot! Heaven bless the butchers' shops— All the year they've mutton chops. CHERRY BOUNCE. Cherry bounce, cherry bounce, bounce I cry! Fill a full glass on the sly— If so be you ask me where, To the wine vaults we'll repair— When we heavy wet renounce. That's the time for cherry bounce. Cherry bounce, cherry bounce, bounce I cry! When my flame is standing nigh— When with love I'm quite beguil'd, And I wish to draw it mild, Then, each vulgar fear to trounce, Then I call for cherry bounce. L'AMORE INFELICITA! A MOCK ITALIAN CANTATA. Sung by Mrs. Fitzwilliam at the Adelphi Theatre. Composed by G. H. Rodwell. RECITATIVE. Felicita! my tender heart's first love!— Primo amor (Cupido!) del cor mio— Chanced on a gentle river's banks to rove— Sento oh Dio! Sul margine d'un rio! Entranced we met, ah me! in sweet duetto, His heart fidele, with love was amoroso— While mine, oh, dolce! lulled by Zephyretto, Andante time was all affettuoso. CANZONETTE. Then canzonetta, In piazetta And gondoletta, Flowed from his tongue! While Contadini, And Signiorini, And great Rossini Enraptured hung, As thus he sung. ARIA. Oh, Pescator del' onda, How sweet with you to wander, Allegretto through the grove. Biondina in gondoletta, Sure nothing can be better— Cara sposa! Oh, my love! RECITATIVE. In pantomime my hand his heart then blesses, While melo-dramatically he his flame expresses. [Pantomime.] BOLERO. Then, fastly as we can go, We dance the blithe fandango— While sounds the gay guitar, Con spirito—comme ca! Castanet Dance.] ADAGIO. Till, ah! a sad terzetto, A rival comes pomposo, To breathe the sospiretto, And move me penseroso— My love no more in petto, I then grow furioso, Kickini—mal—upsetto, I make him solo go so BRAVURA Barbare! non troppo presto! Lasciar me sol fa— Why blight our joy thus, questa Hence, infelicita! CHAPTER OF FISHING. Sung by Mr. Fltzwilliam, Mr. C. Taylor, and Mr. Howell, at Public Dinners, &amp;c. Air—We're a' nodding. They're all fishing, fish, fish, fishing— They're all fishing, every one you meet. Many folks about fishing have of late made a pother, But we're all of us fishing for something or other— All's flesh fishified, and my faith is unshaken, That each man has his bait, which some time will be taken. They're all fishing, &amp;c, The Statesman's a Kingfisher,—a good haul who wishes— He still baits us with bread, to secure the loaves and fishes— The Patriot a Smelt is, still fishing for place, Who'll change like a Dolphin, if one stares him in the face, For they're all fishing, &amp;c. The Soldier's a Pike fish— a blood worms his bait— He fishes for glory, still trusting to Fate— Dancing Masters are Trout fish, who fish to catch eels, And Counsellors all are still fishing for the seals. For they're all fishing, &amp;c. The Doctor's a Leech, who can bite very sharp— The Critics, when fishing, inclined are to Carp— The Lawyer with Gudgeons himself still consoles, And our Pastors, good Christians, are fishing for souls. And they're all fishing, &amp;c. Lovers soft roed fish are, for maids who still angle— Their bait a fine May fly—they themselves oft entangle— The Ladies are White Bait, by which we're oft hook'd, For they sometimes preve Thornbacks in church when we're book'd! And they're all fishing, &amp;c The Bsnkers are Stockfish—the Gold fish they like— The Dandy's a Flat fish, who still seeks to strike— The Sailor's a Jack, who spurns fresh water fish, And who on the ocean can every one dish. And they're all fishing &amp;c. With the Miser all fish is that first comes to net— He baits with a Sprat still a Herring to get— The Sharper's a slippery fish—he is a Skate— While the Clown is a Tickleback, a mere straw his bait. And we're all fishing, &amp;c. The Author's a queer fish, who fishes with lines, Who, though sometimes he flounders, as oftentimes shines— I, an odd fish, am fishing, and not without cause— Do I wish for good sport—I fish for your applause! And we're all fishing, &amp;c. THE MEMORY OF SHAKESPEARE. A CONVIVIAL SONG, Sung by the Author at the Surrey Beef Steak Club, on Shakespeare's Birthday, April the 23rd, 1832. Air—Gee ho Dobbin. To prove both in Arms, and Arts, England bears sway, Once more, friends, St. George ushers in the blest day— The day of all days, when our Shakespeare was born To astonish, improve, to delight, and adorn! All hil, Shaakespeare! Glorious Shakespeare! All hail, Shakespeare! All hail! all hail! Bright Master of Smiles—Great Commander of Tears! Magician, awaking our hopes and our fears— Since, for us, he has fill'd up such full draughts of pleasure, Pledge his Memory in bumpers—yield ‘Measure for Measure.’ All hail, &amp;c. Yes, to Shakespeare we'll drink—come, there's none must deny— To his Memory? No—for he never can die! He's with us—we are all by his Spirit engrost— Then to Shakespeare fill up! 'Twon't be ‘Love's Labour's Lost.’ All hail, &amp;c. May Monopoly ne'er to his Works set a span— But all, by right, still represent him that can! May our wise Legislators but doom those their terrors, Of his Plays who'd a ‘Comedy set forth ‘of Errors.’ All hail, &amp;c. He the ‘Tempest’ controlled—in his ‘Hamlet’ was chief— Spelled our senses, and charm'd, at his will, our belief— Could with all sorts of ranks, at all seasons prevail, For he still for ‘Twelfth Nighi’ had a sweet ‘Winter's Tale.’ All hail, &amp;c. To Woman, best treasure, he's e'en added worth— He to Beatrice, Juliet, Ophelia gave birth— For our sweethearts, a model, as fancy may strike it, I no one shall point out—choose, friends, ‘As you like it.’ All hail, &amp;c. With his ‘Windsor's Gay Wives'’ through long nights we have laugh'd— With ‘Verona's Two Gentlemen oft we have quaff'd— And found the dull hours o'er the grape's ruby stream, Pass as sweetly as does a ‘Midsummer Night's Dream.’ All hail, &amp;c. I no ‘Timon’ will be in proclaiming the skill Of the Will of all Wills of our Warwickshire Will! For though feeble my efforts may prove, it is soothing That none can say there's ‘Much ado about nothing.’ All hail, &amp;c. Now here's to all Dramatists, Minor or Chief— Willy Shakespeare the great, litrle Willy Moncrieff. The highest, and lowest—we can't all excel— So I'll finish my Song, for ‘All's well that ends well.’ All hail, Shakespeare! Matchless Shakespeare! Glorious Shakespeare! All hail! all hail! BALANCING ACCOUNTS! OR, GOOD AND BAD. A COMIC DUET. Air—The Legacy. Tommy Turnstile and Janus Jumble. Tommy. What, my friend, Janus Jumble? Eh? where have you tarried This long time? How are you, and what are your views!Janus. In health, I'm so so. For my views, I've got married!Tommy. Got married! I wish you joy! that is good news!Janus. Nay, not so good, Tommy, for I caught a Tartar—Tommy. That's bad news!Janus. Nay, not so bad. But, I'll explain. She fair was in person—no damsel dress'd smarter— And then she'd a fortune—Tommy. That's good news, again! Janus. Not so good—for I purchas'd some sheep with her money, That died of the rot, one day, all in a heap.Tommy. That was bad!Janus. Not so bad—for I, somehow, 'tis funny— Got more for their skins than I gave for the sheep.Tommy That was good!Janus. No, it weren't—for I laid out my cash In the Stocks and the Funds, by which greatly I lost!Tommy. That was bad!Janus. No, it weren't—for I then made a dash At some houses, and bought them for less than prime cost! Tommy. That was good!Janus. No, it weren't, for my houses took fire, And were burnt to the ground—'tis a sad tale to tell!Tommy That was bad!Janus. Not so bad—it was just my desire, For my termagant wife wss burnt in them as well!Ambo. Then let's be contented, and laugh at life's troubles— Joy still repays woe, Pleasure still follows pain— Endless bliss, Ceaseless woe, are, believe me, mere bubbles: There's no bad without good, there's no loss without gain! MANKIND, DOGS! Sung by the late Mr. Vale with great applause at Covent Garden Theatre, City Dinners. &amp;c. Now first Correctly Printed. Air—March in ‘Blue Beard.’ Pythagoras, that sage pragmatic, Has, if you'll the Ancients seek, Of Transmigrations most Dogmatic, Told in Categoric Greek— That Quadrupeds once Bipeds were, Canis, Equus, or Ursa— Two legs that had, though not a pair, But I shall prove 'tis Vice Versa. Pointer, Lurcher, Mastiff, Spaniel, Each finds, as through life he jogs— The World's no more than one wide Kennel— Mankind, different sorts of Dogs. Soldiers, Pointers in the field are, That a shot delight to hear— Sailors, Mastiffs that ne'er yield, are Whom the foeman well may fear. Pets are Lap Dogs for the Ladies, Comb'd and trimm'd, they Beauty court, Beaux, are Poodles, that on gay days, Brutuses delight to sport! Pointer, Lurcher, &amp;c. Lawyers, Dogs are hard to muzzle Snarling, biting for their prey— Topers, Dogs that love to guzzle, Though they're Water Dogs, they say! What's the Bailiff but a Setter? What are Spendthrifts but their game? Brag's a good Dog, but a better Is Holdfast, and that's their name! Pointer, Lurcher, &amp;c. Courtiers, they're a pack of Harriers, That the Country overrun— Ministers of State are Terriers, In catching Rats excell'd by none! The noisiest Dogs throughout the Nation, Until they a place obtain, Are Patriots—but in situation Placed, they never bark again Pointer, Lurcher, &amp;c. Lovers, Spaniels are, complaining, Though they fawn, the more they're spurn'd, Husbands, House Dogs, that want chaining— Wives, are Turn spits, easy turn'd! Critics, good Dogs are for Vermin, Scribblers killing soon as found— Coxcombs, Pups whose tongues want worming, Pups that very much abound! Pointer, Lurcher, &amp;c. What are Parsons, with their praying, But Sheep Dogs, as we're told, That should keep their flocks from straying— Guide them to their proper fold. Surgeons are a sort of Blood Hounds, To run down all ill intent— Grey hounds, they are very good hounds, As was prov'd in Parliament! Pointer, Lurcher, &amp;c. New Policemen, they are Watch Dogs, Taking great care of the Area. What's Informers? Mongrels, Catch Dogs, Dogs that vilely fetch and carry Honest Men are Newfoundland Dogs, Valuable Dogs, indeed! Where'er found, they're our right hand Dogs, Would we could increase the breed! Pointer, Lurcher, &amp;c. Dogs in Office Magistrates Sometimes prove, to teaze delighting, Growling over the Poor Rates, And at Beggars, snarling, biting! Whigs are Fox Hounds, keen of scent, Whipp'd in by the Treasury hacks— To run Reynard down intent— Gamesters, Dogs that go in Packs Pointer, Lurcher, &amp;c. Proctors, they are Barking Dogs— Dogs that I would not disparage Of Running Couples—Catalogues They give tongue, to us of Marriage! Tax Gatherers, Wolf Dogs once were, Hunting mankind night and day— And some Female Dogs there are, Are sad—what I will not say! Pointer, Lurcher, &amp;c. What's the Opposition Tories? Dogs in mangers—senseless elves! Who would keep us from the glories Which they can't enjoy themselves? What are Dandies? Let them grieve— Pugs Dogs, Shock Dogs, every one— While those, who'd their friends deceive, Mad Dogs are that all should shun! Pointer, Lurcher, &amp;c. The French are Dancing Dogs, delighting Evermore to sport and play— We English, Bull Dogs, that love fighting. That still die ere we give way! A faithful Dog, to friends, I vow, sir, Am I—nor Lurcher, that has fail'd— But I'd best make my bow, wow, wow, sir, Ere, by your anger, I'm curtail'd! Pointer, Lurcher, Mastiff, Spaniel— Each finds, as through life he jogs, The World's no more but one wide kennel— Mankind, different sorts of Dogs ASCOT RACES. Sung by Mr. Sloman at Astley's Amphitheatre. Air—Epsom Races. With spirits gay I'll mount my nag, since all are in their places, So gaily drest, in Sunday best, bang up for Ascot Races— Yet ere I go, I think I'll shew, we're but the fashion gracing, For high and low, and belle and beau, and all the world are racing. Some race the right road, some the wrong some crooked, and some level— The Parson races to the sky, the Lawyer to the Devil. Young Ladies still race after dress, their lovers, and the fashion, While young men they race after them, and often madly dash on! The Buck runs after curricles, low waists, and high shirt collars— The Tailor races after him, and soon the Bailiff follows. Some men race after health, and some race after pleasures funny, While other men race after fame, but all race after money! The Doctor races after fees, in very many cases, And Death, and Mr. Sexton, always follow on his traces— The British Soldiers rrce the foe, who always run before them— And Singers often run away for Audience to encore 'em! Then to the Races now I'll race—zounds, I've no brains about me! For, while that I've been singing here, they have rac'd off without me! THE CHELSEA STEAMERS! OR. A TRIP TO CREMORNE. A new Comic Medley Patter Song, written expressly for Cremorne Gardens, and sung by Mr. Glindon with great applause. Air—Who's for Calais. Who's for Cremorne! for the Steamers are going From London the fare is but Threepence a nob. The sun it is glowing, the breezes are blowing— Such a treat who would slight can be only a Snob. Hark, the steam it is singing, the starting bell's ringing— With Amusements so many, we must not be late— Then quickly let's steer to the Grand Cremorne Pier, Where Momus laughs over the New Water Gate. Prose text has been omitted here. Air—Over the Water to Charlie. In the Steamers, by water, through Battersca Bridge, Cremorne, to thy Gardens we'll hasten! They may ‘Rosin the Bow’ relaxation that grudge The string we'll, more wisely, unfasten! Cremorne can boast of good ale and wine! Cremorne can boast of good brandy! Cremorne can boast lots of pretty girls, As sweet as sugar candy! In the Steamers by water, &amp;c. Prose text has been omitted here. Air—Did you not hear of a jolly young Waterman. In the Steamers alike, whether Citizen, Waterman, For Battersea Bridge or Cremorne that may ply— Your sweetheart take gallantly, wife or your daughter, man, Winning each heart, and delighting each eye. There things they do so tastefully— There the Polka dance so gracefully— All the world and his wife we are sure to meet there— Then who to Cremorne would not gladly repair? In the steamer by water, &amp;c. OH, LORD, MASSA! OR, LILLY SNOWBALL'S LAMENTATION. A Bran New Nigger Peccavi, sung at all the Nigger Concerts. Air—Negro Melody. Mercy, Massa Overseer! Pardon! No be so severe Poor Snowball he be great blackguard, But Cowskin him hit berry hard.

Don't kill a Nigger, pray— Let him lib anoder day— Oh, lord, Massa! Oh, lord, Massa! Massa Lavender, oh, dear! Hold him hand—poor Snowball hear— No lay on so berry fine, Wid black butter no make shine— Though him dance de oder night, When him moon shine berry bright, Wid de girls on de Plantation— Yellow roses of creation— Jump, and dance, and hug, and kissee— Spare him, for de lub of Missee! Him back is berry sore— No stand him any more! Oh, lord, Massa! Oh, lord, Massa! BLOOMSBURY GENTILITY OR, THE TOWN GALA. Sung by Mr. Sloman, the late Mr. Stebbing, and other distinguished Public Singers Tune—Drops of Brandy. Of Madam Fig's Gala and Rout, John Lump has discours'd like a parrot— But 'twixt you and I, that great lout Didn't know a sheep's head from a carrot! Why your Yorkshire Routs bean't worth a straw, When wi' town ones compar'd—'tis na hum, sirs— But I'll tell you of one which I saw When gentleman to Sir John Plum, sirs! Rumpti iddity iddity, &amp;c. Twur on Miss Plum coming o' age, The Rout as I speaks of wur given, Which topp'd all I'd see'd upon Stage, And 'fegs! I thought I was in Heaven, The floors wur all chalk'd wi' fine figures— The walls were all fester'd wi' flowers, sirs— And on tables were jellies—od sniggers! All mouldered like castles and towers, sirs! Rumpti iddity iddity, &amp;c. We had dinner at seven at night, And without the least morsel o' raillery, The crowd that assembled mought fright, The crowd of a Threepenny Gallery. Such pushing, such shoving, such thrustlng, Such squeezing good places to get, sirs— Old Trullebub cried he was bursting! What, thinks I 'fore he's set down to eat, sirs! Rumpti iddity iddiry, &amp;c. A Coachman wur kill'd in the row, Which Miss Dora Plum said wur glorious— And when that I axed her as how, Said she, ‘Lout, 'twill make us notorious.’ The Police, to keep order, remain'd, As the swell mob they said, that they knew, sir— But as not one that came wur detain'd, It show'd as they know'd who was who, sirs. Rumpti iddity iddity, &amp;c. Some tea chests were nail'd up on high The Fiddlers to hold—it be fact, sirs— Which fell down on Alderman Pie, Who call'd out ‘My head it be crack'd sirs. Lord Squint'em's glass eye it got broke, Miss Conk lost her aquiline nose, sirs— While Lady Bloom's cheeks—a good joke— Turn'd to whitey brown 'stead of the rose, sirs. Rumpti iddity iddity, &amp;c. Mrs. Eatall, and old Lady Guttle, 'Bout some pudden had like to've drawn daggers, sirs— While I tumbled whack over the scuttle, And threw some young ladies in staggers, sirs. Salts wur call'd for, and vinegar, too, So I gave 'em the cruets, quite fluster'd, When only think what did they did do In return—I got pepper and mustard. Rumpti iddity iddity, &amp;c. Then wasn't there hobbing and nobbing? All seem'd nation dry in the throttle— Their heads wur for ever a bobbing, As they call'd I to bring a fresh bottle. To see 'em put things out o' sight, To mysen I could scarcely help saying— ‘If folks wish for a good appetite, They mun go where they dine without paying.’ Rumpti iddity iddity, &amp;c. After dinner came tea—and at ten The Company stood up to dance, sirs— When Dowager Bombazine, then, Like a Neddy in panniers did prance, sirs. We supp'd when the day wur a dawning, And then danc'd again till quite lihgt, sir— And at seven o'clock in the morning, They all on 'em wish'd us good night, sirs! Rumpti iddity iddity, &amp;c. A ROUND OF TOPERS? A COMIC BACCHANALIAN SONG. Sung by the late Mr. John Reeve, Mr. Ralph Sherwin, &amp;c. at Convivial Parties. Air—Chapter of Kings. Let Scholars and Saints preach Sobriety's rules— Total Abstinence only is practised by fools. Possessing plain sense, we have not now to learn, That, some time or other, all drink in their turn! For, barring all pother 'bout this, that, or t'other We all take a drop in our turn! The Tanner we very well know soaks his hide, And Blackstrap in plenty's the Shoemaker's pride— The Dustmen gets muddled, till scarce he can stand, While the Glazier has daily his glass in bis hand! Yes, barring, &amp;c. The Player gets funny, by night and by day— While the Potter's delight is to moisten his clay! To be mops and brooms still is the Housemaid inclin'd, And the Chambermaid oft is three sheets in the wind! Yes, barring, &amp;c. The Sailor to be half seas over don't fret— The Parson gets pious—the Quaker gets we.— The Traveller ofttimes is very far gone, And the Gardener's frequently found in the Sun. Yes, barring, &amp;c. To be ‘Non se ipse the Scholar oft bent is— While Madmen, as clearly, are ‘Non compos mentis.’ Tobacconists often get snuffy, we know, And the Ladies themselves are found how came you so? Yes, barring, &amp;c. The Butcher gets muggy, as well as his meat, Undertakers dead drunk get, by way of a treat— The Pitman is in for't—the Soldier is fir'd— And the Poet himself, sir, is sometimes inspir'd! Yes, barring, &amp;c. The Oilman gets Soapy—the Fruiterer, mellow— The Cutler gets cut, though a very sharp fellow— The Doctor his dose takes, for which Patients pay, And the Porter still top heavy gets every day! Yes, barring, &amp;c. Musicians, with Musical Glasses won't quarrel, While the Cooper must still now and then tap the barrel! Friend Snob has his Heeltaps, and loves a wet sole— While the Fiddler still rosins, and sings ‘Old King Cole! Yes, barring, &amp;c. The Pugilist glories the Claret to draw, And to be in his Cups still is Tea Dealers's law. We all are Rum fellows, when ent on good sport, And may they Sherry off, who would not be in Port! Yes, barring, &amp;c. THE TIME O' DAY. Sung by the late Charles Taylor, at Vauxhall Gardens. Air—I made love to Kate. I came up to town, Some half a year ago, An awkward Country Clown, Though now I'm quite a Beau! I did but walk about, To hear what folks should say— And, 'cod! I soon found out What wur the time o'day! Tooral looral loo, &amp;c. I found our Blackleg Dons, White trouser'd plied their trade, So I some Wellingtons Of Feather's flour sacks made. Wi' stays I, like the beaux, Thought I'd my shape display— Wi' collar hid my nose, For that wur time o' day! Tooral looral loo, &amp;c. I'd wore my neckcloths black— Black neckcloths were the Cape— They'll do, thought I, good lack, For 'twill make washing cheap. My hat I cock'd awry, A Brutus to display— Clapp'd quiz glass to my eye, For that wur time o day! Tooral looral loo, &amp;c. Some rare long bills I run, Wi' promises to pay, And when they came to dun, 'Cod, then I ran away! The Bench wur thereabout— Where snug three months I lay— Then whitewash'd walk'd clean out, For that wur time o' day! Tooral looral loo, &amp;c. Through Bond Street then I stroll'd, And bow'd to Lord knows who— In pastrycooks I loll'd, As fashionables do. I star'd at Peers and Clowns, And when they turn'd away— Cried, ‘Sniggers! Dang it! Zounds For that wur time o' day! Tooral looral loo, &amp;c. I met a pratty gal, Says she, ‘Don't follow me!’ Says I, ‘Ecod, I shall’— ‘I'll slap your face,’ says she. I dodg'd her North and South, And, as she rail'd away, Wi' kisses stopp'd her mouth, For that wur time o'day! Tooral looral loo, &amp;c. Thus having rov'd about, Folks' follies to disclose, I nation soon found out 'Twere time my own should close So, 'fegs, I'll now take flight, Or you, mayhap, may say— He at this time o'night, Don't know the time o'day!’ Tooral looral loo, &amp;c. THE NEW LONDON EXHIBITIONS. The different Exhibitions here named were those of the period, 1846. They have of course been replaced by others—but the record may not prove uninteresting hereafter. A COMIC MEDLEY SONG. Sung at different Places of Public Entertainmen. Air—The Temptations of good St. Anthony. 'Tis said, that there is nothing new under the sun— Though we new Exhibitions each day see appear And to each Exhibition the multitude run, As eager as they did to those of last year. There's the fam'd Polytechnic, it you will but fee 'em, Where onr shillings dissolve, and no more meet the view— Zoological Gardens, and gay Colosseum— Which, I wonder, the most Monkies has of the two? The New Figures of Madame Tussaud, large as life— And two times as natural—wery uncommon! Don Francisco, who draws all the World and his Wife— With Tourniaire's Curriculum, and Exercise Roman. And, What is it? Can it be Monkey or Man? The Wild Man of the Prairies, who'd all things but speech— Was it human, or Unicorn? Tell, if you can— What is it? Why, itrwas the Gnome Fly, Hervey Leach! Air—Boatman, dance. There's the Ethiopian Serenaders, Who're in the Black Art surely traders— If you ask how I prove my case— They've all of them sung till they're black in the face! Sing, Minstrels, sing, And twang your Banjo string— The folks delight 'Till twelve at night, Or very near one in the morning! With OIO, the boatman row! To hear the Ethiopians, Sure every one must go. Air—The Statute Fair. Then there's the famous Hall of Rome, Chock full of Classic grouping— (Such ne'er before was seen at home)— Where all the Swells are trooping! Where there's the Poses Plastique, Tobleaux Vivons all living— The Tales of Roman and of Greek— Art, with Nature striving. Venus's, in fleshings tight— Dianas dress'd in Buff, sir— The real thing—oh, such a sight! Al, other sights are stuff, sir! Air—Fine Old English Gentleman. Then there's the Panorama, that is shown in Leicester Square, In which so many miies are seen, it makes the Nativds stare— Where the Battle of Sabraon's daily fought in safety there— Of which the Sikhs so soon were sick, our courage was so rare— All prov'd themselves true Englishmen, worthy the olnea fime! Air—King and the Countryman. Then there's the Automaton that speaks, and never never stops for days and weokt— His ain't the only wooden head, by which so many foolish things are said! Ri tooral looral, &amp;c. Like the Carpenter, and wooden fiddle, the maker of it isn't idle, But says, that in his head, no bother, he's wood enough to make another. Ri tooral looral, &amp;c. Air—Oh, light is the heart. If light is your heart at the close of the day, To the Gardens of Cremorne by Steam haste away— Where Quadrilles you may danee, gin and water may suaff, And have at the Monkies and Dogs a good laugh. Ha, ha! jollily laugh! Ha, ha! jollily laugh! Happy the night—blue devils take flight— Ha, ha! at Cremorne all's ligha! Air—King of the Cannibal Islands. And lastly, to complete the round, Evans's Supper Rooms are found, Where store of all good things abound— He's the King or the Eatable Islands! There's chops, and steahs, and nips, and goes And kidneys, all in skew'ry rows— Welch Rabbits, too, as you'll suppose, Grateful to eyes, and mouth, and nose— Then 'tis ‘No Song, no Supper’ there, All those who like may take a share— There is not one but his Bob will bear In Evaus's Eatable Islands! 'Tis Carnival the whole year round, Though no Carne Vale there is found, Such stores of all good things abound In Evans's Eatable Islands! THE FAT BOY. Sung by Mr. T. Richardson, &amp;c. at various Public Places. Air—We're a' noddin. Don't disturb yourself, pray—'tis but Joe, the Fat Boy, Who was never known any one's rest to destroy. I've come here quite by chance, so, for company's sake, I'll just sing you a song—it will keep me awake. For we are all noddin', nid, nid noddin', We are all noddin', abroad and at home. People scold because sometimes I sleep in the day, Although I might answer, so do they— For I think I can prove, if you'll list to my rhymes, Every one of them may be caught nodding at times. Yes, they all noddin, nid nid noddin, They are all noddin, abroad ank at home. The Parson, who tells us to watch and to pray, And will not on Sundays at home let us sty, Nods at church o'er his sermon, and makes us, the elf, Nod long ere it's finished as much as himself. For they are all noddin, nid nid noddin, They are all noddin to church when they come. Both Houses of Parliament nod, too, you'll find— When one party speaks, to sleep t'other's inclin'd— One nods till the other side's said all their say, And as or the Speaker, he nods night away. For they are all noddin, nid nid noddin, They are all noddin to the House when they come. Young folks, when the old folks to nod are inclin'd, And her lover's enteeating that she will be kind, That she neither may grant nor deny him the bliss, Will appear to nod, too, while he steals a sweet kiss. Fur they are all noddin, nid nid noddin, They are all noddin at our house at home. But I'm getting quite tir'd—no doubt you're so too— Ya-aw! I really beg pardon—I'll bid you adieu, 'Tis high time, for I scarce my eyes open can keep, And I'm sure that I must have walk'd here in my sleep! For we are all noddin— yaw-aw!—nid nid noddin— We are all noddin—yaw-aw!—to the end when come! [Yawns—sinks into chair—falls aslaep—snores, and is carried off, first having a nightcap put on him.] THE END.</field>
