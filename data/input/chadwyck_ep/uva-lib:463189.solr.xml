      <field name="fulltext">Qui nuclium esse vult, nucem frangat, oportet. Hecubaes mishaps. Expressed by way of apparition, touching the manifolde miseries, wonderfull calamities, and lamentable chances that happened to her vnfortunate selfe, sometime Queene of stately Troy. When that Auroraes dewes were past, and PhÅbus did decline, And purple Titan ready prest with fainting light to shine. When Cynthia did prease in place to run her compasse round, And feeblely did shew her face with duskish light on ground. Then walked I to silent groue my fancie to delight, Where willingly I meant to bide to passe the pensiue night. Sweete silence there her sound did yeeld, no noyse did me molest: All chirping notes were whisht at once, each breathing soule did rest. Amidst the hollow groue I past to ease my musing minde, But no redresse of dolefull dumpes I any where could finde: Untill at last I viewde the skies where lucent lights abound: And downe againe mine eyes direct vpon the human ground. Then did I shake from sobbing soule the griping griefe and paine, That long before had me opprest, but now reuiude againe. Within the groue a pleasant streame with bubling note did flowe, Which I by chaunce had soone found out from hollow bankes below. There musing by the running tide and soundings of the deepe: The sliding flouds that smoothly passe had husht me soone asleepe. And as I slept on greenish shore, by help of warbling streames Strange fearefull fancies frighted me, by dreadfull drowsie dreames. In slumber sound me thought I spied a wight both fierce and fell: A thing despisde, in viler sort no creature was in hell. A woman vext with eager lookes in frantike fierie moode. With clapping hands and rowling eyes vncertainly she stoode. She ran about with flaring haire, much like to horses stout, When sodain fright had pierst their minds, with strouting tayles did strout. Euen so or worse she roude about with head and shoulders bare: And oftentimes from senselesse pate her pendant lockes she tare With bloudie nayles and hands imbrued, her palmes she oft did smite: And reaching for the heauens, as though she to the Gods had spite. With irefull cries and fearefull notes the hollow groue did sound: In yelling fort from gulled bankes the ditties did rebound. Like mightie bulles that fiercely meetes, and filles with noise the skies. And for a token of their wrath the dustie grauell flies, By tearing vp of earth, so she in such like frantike fits Doeth snatch vp grasse in griping hands, as one beside her wits. Still stalking on, vntill at last she found me where I were: Thus fancie fed my dreadfull dreame with grieuous gripes of flare. But when that she approached neere, and stood me by, at length Me thought my trembling ioynts did quake, to flie I had no strength. With starting steps I sought to flie, to shun that fearfull sight: But all in vaine J oft assayed to saue my selfe by flight. My fainting feet did often faile by striuing still to start: No forced pace would ought preuaile, or suffer to depart. Thus stil me thought amid my dreame (as one that were in maze) With quaking corps and haire vpright full still I stoode at gaze. For feare my faltring tongue did stay, I durst her not behold, Vntill at last with friendly cheare she said, my friend be bold. I wish to thee no harme at all, wherfore be not dismayde: But call to minde thy frighted sence, and be thou not afraide. Ne maruell why though I disguisde, haue furiously been vext: Jn raging sort so strange to thee for that J am perplext In minde and soule, to thinke how far fell Fortune hath abusde Both me and mine in spitefull sort, when hautie Gods refusde To succour vs in greatest need, she turnde her face and fround, Who long had smiled, but now gaue help to croude vs to the ground. Wherfore good friend, quoth she, geue eare and marke what I shall tell. Lift vp thy minde, be not dismayd, and note my speeches well: For I must needes declare the cause to ease my pensiue brest Of haplesse hap that Fate assignde, and then in hope to rest. With that me thought I banisht feare, and quaking limmes reuiude. I courage tooke againe afresh, of which I was depriude. Then boldly thus I said at last, what madnes doeth possesse Thy vexed soule? Be sure if that thy paine J may redresse, To finde some ease of this thy griefe or els I were vnkind: Therefore be short, to ease thy smart, and let me know thy mind Jt pities me to see the plight of thy distressed state, And makes me shrinke at all to gesse on this thy heauy fate: For that no fiend that comes from hell could any more lament Their peruerse lot for wickednes and sinnes already spent, Than thou hast here before my face with bounsing blowes and cries, Whereat the caues reuerberate, and Echo roles in skies. But now dispatch, shew me thy mind, if so to ease thy griefe Thou thinke it best: I am content that way to geue reliefe. Then she began to shew her minde, and tell her griefe forepast With grieuous grones in wofull wise, these words she spake at last. If euer any wofull wight had cause to rue her fate, And pleade with teares her heauie hap for change of her estate: My selfe haue iust cause to bewayle my state which I thought sure. But woe is me vnhappy wretch, what ioy doeth aye endure? On Fortune fell J doe complaine, the cause of my mishap, That thus hath dealt with me alas, when first within her lap She lulld full sweet, and vsde right well, and then ere that I wist Did tumble downe from top of throne, thus Judas like she kist. She lifted me so high aboue my mates and fellowes all, For that more grieuous when I fell she meant to make my fall. But would from beggars broode at first my chance had beene so good To spring, and that I had beene borne and bred of meanest blood, Then would the world not so haue musde to see my sodaine chance To fall so low, whom Fortune earst so highly did aduance. Yet geue me leaue to ease my minde although J wish in vaine: For now tis past by wishing I doe ease my pining paine. The trueth is thus, I did descend from Cysseus that king A mightie Prince of Thrace wel knowen, whose praise each where did ring. And from his house! higher stept to highest place of state: For Pryamus the king of Troy did take me for his mate. Who was the stately Emperour of Asia, and there Amongst the hautie Phrygians the diademe did weare. Then Queene was I of flaunting Troy. The Troyans all reioyce That Priamus their Lord and king had made of me his choice. There many noble sonnes had I, the world doeth witnes beare: No Nation vnder heauen that day with me durst once compare In valure with so many sonnes by one brought foorth to sight: Each people on the earth as yet will yeeld to them their right; That for so many bretheren, as J brought foorth (poore Queene) I say againe that neuer since by any hath beene seene. And that I meane to prophesie, wherefore I dare be bold To say the like will neuer be while heauen and earth dooth hold. But for because I would not wish thou shouldst my name mistake: Whom Greekes and Romanes long agoe in dolefull verse did make The world to know, and now my selfe shall verefie the same: Who called me olde Hecuba, so truely was my name, A wretched wight too olde indeede, for that I liude so long, To scape the fire that burned Troy, to suffer further wrong: O would to God J then had died, when Pryamus my mate By Pyrrhus sword receiude the wound, but now I wish too late, Fell destinie denide me that and sparde me for the nonce, To plague me with a thousand woes, ten thousand all at once. But first to tell my fatall hap, and orderly proceede To shew, howe that the angry gods against me had decreede And vowed, I thinke, by one consent to worke me double woe, Or else I neuer so had died to please my spitefull foe, As after thou shalt knowe: but first J wish to ease my minde, In shewing how that destinie and haplesse fate assignde To me poore wretch such mischiefe vile, as none did euer taste. Before nor since, though long agoe my miseries were past: For first within my body I, to my great paine, did beare And nourish vp the fruit which was the cause of all my care, With childe I was, but then vnknowne what fruit I foorth should bring To ioy my selfe, or else to please olde Pryam Troyan king My louing mate, who vsde me well, wherefore J wisht to please His quiet minde, by my good will, that we might liue at ease: But see how froward fortune frownd, a dreame did me molest, And fearefull fright did trouble me when I was layd to rest, Me thought I was deliuered of such a fearefull sight, For all was fire which J brought forth, and flamde as fire bright, With furie great the fire waxt, with flames the aire did streame: Thus doubtfull dumpe, by fright did pierse my breast in dreadfull dreame. When that J wakde I tolde the king, how Morpheus had delt With me in sleepe, and further how what agonie J felt, Who presently to oracle would haue no nay, but sent To know what by this fierie flame and dreadfull dreame was ment, The dreame resolude, the Oracle, for answere did returne, That I a sonne should beare, and he should cause strong Troy to burne With fire bright, and for his cause olde Pryamus his sire, And I his mother should behold our towne to burne with fire, And all our people slaine downe right in fighting for his sake A mightie foe for his abuse should sharpe reuengement take. Which to preuent the father sought, to slay his harmelesse boy, For that he thought some mischiefe might by his meanes hap to Troy, And for because the Oracle on him vnborne, did giue Such sentence which did fright his sire, wherefore he might not liue, That when his sonne was borne, foorthwith the father did betake The childe vnto a trusty friend, that he away might make The boy which well I loude, but yet such pity did remaine Within my breast, that I reserude my sonne which should be slaine, And closly spake vnto the man, that he my childe shoulde spare, And tell the king, at his returne, that cruell beasts did teare The tender limmes of his yong sonne: wherefore he now was free From such suspect as erst before the Oracle did see. The aged King was then content, and thought all things were well, He feared not the prophesie, which these things first did tell: Thus did J breede and foster vp euen him that did destroy Both parents, friends and countrey kinde, and sought our great annoy, The lad did liue with heard in field, and shortly vp was growen, So that he for King Pryams sonne by secret signes was knowen, Then was the youth callde home againe, and Pryam was content To take him for his sonne, and did his former acte repent. But when sir Paris came to Court, for so we callde his name, The doting boy began to loue and follow Uenus game, Enquiring oft when fame would bring newes of a peerelesse peece And passing dame, which that ere long had tidings thus from Greece, That there the flower of all the world sir Menelaus helde, The like to her on all the earth no Nation then could yelde: For whom vnknowne my sonne did dote, in such exceeding sort, That he to Greece by sea would passe, to see if that report Had blazde a truth: but first before to Grecian soile he went, He craude of me and Priamus, to yeelde him our consent: Then shippes were built on seas to saile, king Pryam willd it so, And mates for him were picked out, and hence to Greece they go, At Lacedemon he at length, a place of Greece so calld Ariude, and in their safest rodes, his wearie shippes in halld By Menelaus his consent, who foorthwith did inuite The Troyans all vnto his court, suspecting no such spite As after did betide, for that sir Paris did conuay Faire Helen thence, his louing wife, and so without delay Did hoise vp saile, and speedie windes did send him soone to Troy, Where many of his friends did wait to welcome his newe ioy. But Helen thus conuaide from Greece, the angry Greekes waxe mad, To see how Paris plaid his prankes, when Menelaus had Receiued his guest in frankest sort, and did him friendly vse, Whose courtesie to recompence, the letcher did abuse His honest host by spitefull rape, in stealing of his wife, Which hatefull cause did soone procure sharpe warre and deadly strife: Yet first the Greekes, I must confesse, like honest minded men Did send to Troy, to haue againe faire Helena which then Was brought to Troy, and their demaund, to end the bloody iarre, Which likely were to followe fast, and turne to deadly warre. But Priam he, with his fierce sonnes their lawfull sute denide, For which the Greekes, to take reuenge to Pryams Kingdomes hied: From Greece they saile to Phrygia land, which haughty Pryam held, And there arriude in dreadfull sort well armed with speare and sheld: The warre began great slaughter was, for mightie Mars did raigne: Full fierce they fought for ten yeares space, yet neither party gaine, Such losse there was on either side in lamentable sort, That Phrygia soile did flowe with blood, the world can giue report. When Phrygia thus was ouer-run by Grecians ouer stout, Unto the Troyan walls they marchde and compast it about, Where Pryam held his stately court, not passing of their spight, Nor fearing future hap at all, but still maintained fight, Where from the top of stately walls we dayly might beholde Right neere our sight the slaughters great of Troyan youth full bolde, And Greekes likewise on euery side the Troyans fierce did daunt, They lay on heapes wherefore as yet they iustly could not vaunt Nor brag, for that their mighty peeres in bloodie broile were slaine, Wherefore to end the warre begun to sue did not disdaine To haue saire Helen backe againe, for whom this warre begunne, And eke to boote they offer made yong Polidore my sonne, Whom Polymnestor King of Thrace had to the Greeks betrayde, When Pryam first had placed him there, in hope of better ayde: For when we knew the Greekes did minde to make sharpe warre with Troy, To Polymnestor King of Thrace, we sent our yongest boy, A mighty masse, and treasure great with this our sonne we sent, In hope to keepe him free from warre, and from the Greekes intent: But then the Thracian King betrayde (O vile disloyall wretch) The harmelesse lad vnto the Greekes, this was the traitours fetch, To holde the coyne which then he had, and so to yeelde the childe Vnto the Greekes for lucres sake, lo thus we were beguilde, Which boy the Grecians brought to Troy, and made request againe, That Helen Menelaus wife in Troy might not remaine But be restorde, then Polidore from their hands should be free, And we our sonne might haue againe, and warre should ended bee: But if in case that we denied, and Helen did detaine, Then Polidore for brothers fault should presently be slaine. Olde Pryamus would not consent that Helen backe should goe, But helde perforce the wanton wench in spite of proudest foe, And willd them for to doo their worst, for Helen meant to bide, Wherefore he would not yeeld her vp what euer might be tide. It well was knowne vnto the Greekes, that Pryam bade her chuse To stay in Troy, or goe to Greece, which she did flat refuse, And for because she willing was with Paris to be still, He would by no meanes send her backe against her owne good will. Then sent he word to Grecian campe, if that they had decreed His sonne should die, his other sonnes should make them rue the deede, And that the fieldes of Troy should flowe with gorie blood full fast, Untill the Grecians did repent their enterprised hast. But now alas began my woe, my sorrowe did increase, For neuer day from this time foorth mine eies from teares did cease, O Polidore my yongest boy, sweete Polidore my sonne From Troyan walles J did behold how fast the Grecians run To doe thee wrong, my harmelesse childe, and mightie stones did bring Thicke thronging fast with furie great, at Polidore they fling, Who sure was tyed at fastned stake, which J from Troyan wall Might well beholde how bouncing blowes did make my childe to sprall, Not ceasing till my sonne were slaine, nor then, but still did smight The brused bones of my sweet boy within his mothers sight: O hellish plague, O torture vile, me thinke I see it still, How Grecians raging mad did strike, the harmelesse soule to kill, With wringing hands I looked on, yet loath to see him die, I turnd my backe, and strait againe J coulde not chuse but prie For this my sonne, who bleeding lay so bobde with waightie stones, The flesh with blowes was mangled so, eche man might see the bones, Yet would mine eies haue passage still to this his carkasse dead, Till that my liuing sonnes from top of Troyan wals had lead Their mother downe, whose folding feete her body could not stay: Which they perceiued, so that from thence me wretch they did conuay. To Grecian campe a messenger we did commaund to trudge, To craue the body of my sonne, which thing they did not grudge, But sent the martyrde corps to Troy, as custome did require, They said not nay but graunted straight when Priam did desire. And also did a present send to breede me further woe: The bloudy stones that kild my sonne on me they did bestowe. VVhose bloud and braines in vgly sort about the stones was seen: A homely present to be sent to me most wretched Queen. Then shrinde we vp with weeping teares, our sonne so vilely slaine, And put the stones in tombe with him, for euer to remaine. His brothers mad with this mischaunce, for battell strong prouide: And to reuenge their brother slaine to Grecian Campes they hide. VVhere from the walles we had in view such cruell sturdy fight, That mightie men to death were sent, thus battell raignd downright. The Greekes by thousands fell to ground, their people goe to wracke: And that ere long the Troyans stout by Greekes are beaten backe. Thus Fortune playes in double sort, sometime with vs to stand, And then to flie to thother part, and geue the vpper hand. But while that Hector liued in Troy, king Priams eldest sonne, The proudest Peere that came from Greece his mightie hand would shun, And fly the sield before him fast, they feared so his name: So fierce he fought amongst their men, each Greeke dooth know the same. At last my lot was so extreame to see him likewise die: In turret top from lofty towne his death I did espie. For when as he had slaine that day in mighty battell strong, Of kingly Peeres the chiefe of all that oft had doone vs wrong. And there amongst the rest he had a noble Grecian slaine, VVhose armour all was beaten golde, which pray he went to gaine: And drew him vp vpon his steede, and rode foorth of the throng, And for his better ease his shield vpon his back he flong. VVhile he did spoyle him of his weedes, carelesse of any wight, His naked breast vnarmed then Achilles had in sight How he was busie, and therefore from couert where he lay By stealing steppes behinde his backe he tooke the ready way, And suddenly with fatall speare ere that he could aduert, He vnawares with furie great thrust Hector to the heart. Thus died he thorowe auarice, whom thousands could not kill, Untill his wilfull foolishnesse himselfe did fondly spill. My selfe, I say, that time did see from top of lofty towers, The Troyan fieldes besprinckled with dew of bloudy showers, That Hectors launce had letten out, but now his latest fate I soone had spide, and did lament to see the wofull state Of this king Priams eldest sonne, and eke my chiefest ioy: For well I wist that while he liude no harme could hap to Troy. But now Achilles ouercrowed him whom he fearde before: Wherefore he stabde him thorowly that he might liue no more. I saw, I saw how Hector lay as dead as any stone: And yet the tyrant would not leaue but mighty blowes layd on. For if my sonne had beene aliue and armed for to fight: Achilles durst not come in place, nor once be seene in sight. But when by chance my naked sonne Achilles launce had payde, The eager Greeke to lay on lode was nothing then afraide. When noble Hector thus was dead, yea dead, and dead againe, Achilles then to spoyle my sonne began to take some paine. J sawe how that he handled him, I could not looke beside: And if J did, yet straight againe my sight that way would glide. The tyrant vile, the bedlam beast his carkas would not spare, Who was a man, a valiant man, his noble mind was rare. Another of king Priams sonnes that day was caught in fight, Whose hands chopt off the Greeks sent home to worke vs further spite. And wilde him thus to say in Troy, and tell his aged sire That Hector now by Grecian launce was payd his earned hire. And that Achilles had no doubt but Paris so to slay, VVho was the cause of all that warre, and bred that bloudy day. Thus came my sonne with losse of hands before his mothers face, To tell how Greekes had dealt with him, a lamentable case. And how that Hector now was dead, whom Troyans soon should misse: VVhich was no newes for that before mine eyes had seene all this. And while my boy besmearde with bloud his heauie hap did waile, A seruant came and shewde vs how Achilles vile did hale Dead Hector round about the walles in all the Troyans sight: VVhich was because his frends should see, as easily they might His naked corps in mire drawne at horses taile fast tide: And that the doer of the same before did vaunting ride. Then came I to the wall to see slaine Hector so misusde: From whence I cride for that I knew the Greekes had him abusd VVho was king Priams eldest sonne wherfore against all law In cruell sort to spite his friends, his carkasse dead to draw. VVith that I strainde my voice and said, Achilles, let me haue My sonne whom thou hast slayn, that I may send him to his graue. But he for all my mournfull cries, full fierce without remorce: Did hale my naked sonne about the Troyan walles perforce. VVhich when his aged sire beheld, from top of lofty wall For griefe conceiude did yeald himselfe in desperat wise to fall Down headlong from the turrets height, if friends had him not stayd: And throngd about to succour him who then had need of ayd. But when at last he did perceiue Achilles cruell hart, VVith beckning hand he spake aloud, Be sure for this hard part, Jf that J liue, thou shalt repent, and Gods the same will graunt Thy wicked act: and that ere long, vile wretch, thou shalt not vaunt Of this despitefull fact, wherfore I wish thee to restore My slaughtered sonne, as I haue done thy slaughtered Greeks before. Yet would not fierce Achilles cease from doing Hector wrong: For round about the Troyan walls he halde our sonne along. And thus did still for four days space euen in his parents sight To work our wo, for well he wist he could not Hector spight VVho then was dead, whose gaping iawes the durt and grauell fild. VVhose whighish skin the muddy mire with filthy spots had hild. His beard besmeard with stinking filth, to eyes and face did clung Such lothsome stuff as filthy Greeks with durty fists had flung. VVas this a sight for parents eye to vew their louing child In such a case as he was then amongst his foes so wild? O haples hap, O Fortune vile, what woman could abide Such pangs of wo from sobbing soule as did to me betide? VVe did not cease to sue for grace at proud Achilles feet In yealding wise, to haue our sonne, although it were not meet A mighty king should stoup so low vnto so meane a state, For that vnto the Troyan king Achilles was no mate. But yet for all king Priams sute, when he did what he might, The tyrant would not yeald as yet our sonne should haue his right Of funerall, nor that his bones should rest in silent graue: VVhen we had made such humble sute his mangled corps to haue. Vnburied thus he kept him still for twelue days space at least: VVhose flesh was torne, and then did will the dogs should haue the rest. VVhich when I heard, a hell of woes did plague me then aliue. O death (quoth I) my loathed life from miseries depriue, Let not me liue to call to mind this Fortunes froward spite, Nor see the day wherin againe such heauie hap may light. Yet still in hope to haue his corps, Polixena I sent My daughter faire, to Grecian campe and to Achilles tent. Who there on knees with wringing hands before Achilles face With brinish teares made humble suite, to find as then such grace, As that he would as then restore the corps of this her brother slaine. And for which cause to pleasure him she euer would remaine His seruant base, or bondslaue vile, to satisfie his mind. For which, if that it pleasd him well, she then would stay behind To be a faithfull seruant true to him at all assayes: And pray the Gods to prosper him, and send him happie dayes. With that Achilles stepped foorth, and gaue to her his hand: In courteous wise he greeted her, and wilde her vp to stand Before his face, and waile no more, and then as she thought best He was content it should be so, and graunted her request. This did my daughter bring to passe such was her peereles hewe That she a second Helen was within Achilles vewe. When Priamus and Hectors wife before had tried in vaine, And I myselfe with weeping teares the like could not obtaine. Her beautie so did qualifie the tyrants wrathfull ire, That Hectors corps was brought by her home to her aged sire. Then did J mourne afresh, to see there laide before my face The ougly shape of my sweet sonne in such a wofull case That Hectors face I could not know although I knew his name. For Hecuba his mother J before had geuen the same, Whose corps once washt, full well I knew the fauour of my child. But pale aspect did alter much, that neare J was begilde. Twelue dayes at least my sonne had lain abroad in open ayre: VVhat time till now to haue againe we euer did despaire. The funerals and other rites in order allwell done: VVe did prouide the mony, which redeemed this our sonne. For first before my daughter had the thing she did desire, Achilles he a certain summe of mony did require. VVhich thing before he had refusde, though massie summes were sent: But for her sake and such a summe he seemed well content. The money now without delay we sent away in hast: And willingly did pay the same for daughters promise past. O wretch most vile, O tyrant bad, that thus with Hector delt: VVhat stonied heart in brawned breast would this not make to melt? The cause of this his furie great, and of such cruell hate Was by Patroclus haplesse death, who was his louing mate, Whom Hector slewe in open fight, with many a Greeke that day, And spoylde him of his armor bright, that naked there he lay, Which armor was the chiefest canse that brought him to his end, The angry gods displeasde with vs such haplesse hap did send. All things thus done, my other sonnes reuenge did vowe to take, On vile Achylles for this deede, and for slaine Hectors sake, That presently vpon the Greekes with mightie force they went, And thousands on ech part that day to dreadfull death were sent. Thus dayly they did still contend by force of cruell warre, And Princes fell on eyther side, that thither came from farre: The Greekes did waxe, the Troyans grew as desperat men in fielde, To daunt eche others haughty minde, and make eche other yeelde: At last againe as fortune woulde Achylles fierce did slay My other sonne, sir Troylus, who was our chiefest stay. A valiant youth the Greekes can tell, although he thus did die, For that before the proudest Greekes he forced had to flie. Jn turrets tall from toppe of towne, my hap was still so bad, To see my louing sonne to die, a wofull sight most sad For mothers eie still to beholde her louing children so To end their dayes, and be abusde by such a spitefull fo, From loftie walls I then beheld sir Troylus my sonne, To course the Greekes on euery side, and made them fast to run, Untill that fierce Achylles came, who sure I thinke was borne To breede my woe, and that the gods against me wretch had sworne To plague with hellish torments vile, the plagues of furthest hell Should hap to me, and greater paines than any tongue can tell, For that what time soeuer I on walls did see the fight Some childe of mine was sure to die, within his mothers sight. When nowe to turrets top I climde with many Ladies more, Whereto I did not once ascend, since Hector dide before: But then too soone such was my chaunce, I thinke the gods decreede, That while I did behold the fight no better they should speede. Achylles braue, on horse did mount, whom Troylus had spide To brag amongst the Greekes, his mates, well mande on euery side: But when my sonne had found his foe, and thought on Hectors foile, Like mighty Mars he layd on lode, and made that day great spoile: He thrust amongst the thicest throng Achylles out to finde, That he might knowe his brothers death, as yet he had in mind. With couched launce and courage good, my sonne did run amaine In hope to haue by manly force his cruell foe there slaine, He mist the marke, but yet he strake Achylles from his steede, And if the Greekes had not giuen ayde, he then had done the deede: And yet for all the Greekes could do, he gaue his foe a wound Thorowe plated thigh, he thrust his launce a handful in the ground. Achylles horsde by helpe of Greekes, and mounted vp anew, And then with troupe of armed Knights my sonne he did pursue: The wounded Greeke that folowed fast, sir Troylus had spide, Who turnd his horse, and willd his mates his fury to abide, With monstrous force, the Greekes did fight, the Troyans did not flie On either side to lay it on, the people fiercely cry: At last the Greekes had giuen the horse that then my sonne did beare A mortall wound, that paind him so, the iade did fiercely fare, In plunging sort, the horse did play with mighty gyrds, at last From setled seate my haplesse sonne the winsing iade had cast: In falling downe (ah heauy chance) his foote the stirrop helde, The wounded horse so scard before, ran raging in the field, And dragd my childe before my face vpon the bloody ground, For blood did flow that dayful fresh from many a mortal wound. Achylles hauing spide my sonne in such a woful case, With piercing speare to him halfe dead, he hied him then apace, Through backe and side his launce he sent, and cride, J now am quit With this my wound receiude before, and therewithal did hit The staggring horse that downe he fel, and there together lay Both man and horse: thus fortune vile her froward pranks did play. Sir Troylus by chance thus slaine, the Greekes from armour stript, Whose bowels hung about his feete, for they his body ript, And naked on a gibe they hang for Troyans there to see Their champion stout whom earst before had made the Greekes to flee. Olde Pryamus and I beheld our louing sonne so kinde In vgly sort to hang on high starke naked in the winde, Whose corps did waue in swinging-sort which way each wind did blowe: And as he hung, the angry Greekes at him great stones did throwe, Their speares did passe through senselesse corps, before him slaine they vaunt, So fierce the fooles his carkasse dead with bitter words did taunt: Hang here (quoth they) thou wicked wretch, and rue thy brothers deede, If he by Grecian fist be caught, no better shall he speede, For causing of this bloody warre that many thousands rue Their haplesse chance, but he himselfe we trust shall haue his due, And that ere long, wherefore till then feele thou his earned smart: We Greekes do hope that Paris proude shal rue his wilful part. These words we heard, this sight we see, the Greekes like mad men rage, They threaten stil for Paris deede, sharp war with vs to wage. A sight ful strange, yet not so rare for fortune did present More harder haps to me than this, to plague me she was bent. A messenger we sent to craue the carkasse of our childe, Whose bones were broke and skin from flesh, with blows the Greeks had hilde Achylles straight, did send my sonne which something pleasde my minde, I did not thinke such curtesie at his handes then to finde. But with my sonne to comfort me, these louing words did send My friend (quoth hee) tel Hecuba, that oft I do intend, Such gifts on her for to bestow to breed her further ioy: Til such time serue, wish her to take of me this mangled boy. Thus Troylus was brought to Troy, a heauie sight God knows, His body foule disfigured with many bloody blows: They layde him downe before my face that mothers eies might see Her sonne whom fierce Achylles vsde with such extremitie, His martyrde corps I did intoombe, though part were left behinde Which Grecian iades did tread to dirt, yet al that I could finde, To graue was sent: the funerals and al things else wel done, The Troyans al in woful wise do much lament my sonne, That al the towne with houlings sound ech one did waile his fil: Him dead, I know it was in vaine, but that did shew good will. Now did the Greekes afresh begin the Troyans to suppresse, And they as fierce did fight it out, in hope to haue redresse Of former wrongs, but al in vaine, for Hector now was gone, And Troylus my other sonne, wherefore there was not one Aliue in Troy, that durst presume Achylles once to meete, VVho thus had slaine my noble sonnes, and crouded vnder feete, The brauest peere of Troy that durst incounter with his force, VVith Grecian launce he threw to ground, thus had he no remorce, But still did striue by martial force to beat the Troyans downe, And egerly maintained fight in hope to sacke our towne, My sonnes thus slaine the warre increast, and bloody sight did growe, No Troyan durst within my sight incounter this my foe, So that before our walls he marchde with glistring speare and shield Like mightie Mars, he oft did dare the Troyans to the field, Which made me woe to see him raigne that thus with me had delt, Whose cruell hand (to our great losse) the haplesse Troyans felt: A counsell then of matrons wise I presently did call, How to reuenge my slaughtred sonnes, to counsell straight we fall, That fierce Achylles might not vaunt of this his cruel deede: Together then we layde our heades, in such a time of neede, We thus conclude, that best it were, Achylles to insnare With some fine peece of Venus Court, whose beauty shoulde be rare: And forbecause the Greeke wel knowne, to loue a daintie peece, Which I had spide, for that before he sayled home to Greece When Agamemnon tooke away sweete Briseis his delight, No longer then, he would abide, nor for the Greekes did fight: Till Briseis was againe restorde, which thing J wel did note, And was right glad that beautie faire could make my foe to dote. And forbecause Polixena his sight did wel content, When she to fetch her brothers corps, to Grecian campe was sent, So that at first he fraunted her, when we before had nay, And whatsoeuer she did craue was done without delay. Which wel I wist, wherefore foorthwith my daughter I bedect With gorgeous geare in hope to bring my purpose to effect, And presently to Grecian campes a messenger I send Unto Achylles tent to shew what then J did intend: Which messenger J did commaund his arrand thus to tell That Hecuba the Queene of Troy, Achylles greeted well: And further, that he should declare, Achylles should inioy My daughter faire Polixena the peerelesse flower of Troy, No other wight J do desire, for that mine eies behelde The noble valour of the man so tride in Troyan field. The Greeke hath often made me glad to see his courage bolde, For from the highest walls of Troy I gazing did beholde, To view Achylles that braue Greeke, so lyon-like to vaunt Before the towne, and with his force the proudest foe to daunt: And that although my sonnes were slaine in warre by lucklesse chaunce, Yet were I glad their hap were such, as that vpon his launce To end their liues, that no reproch might happen to them dead, And that Achylles right wel knew they died before they fled, And for their death J nothing grieue, for that my sonnes were slaine By such a noble Grecian peere, whose like doth not remaine In all the world such worthy fame the peerelesse Greeke hath woon: Say thus, quoth she, I shall not rest till that he be my sonne. My daughter for the courtesie that she with him did find Cannot forget the benefit, but still doeth beare in mind The friendly vsage of the Greeke, at whose hands she hath found Such sweet reliefe, that euer since to this day she is bound To yeald to him her chiefest friend, and willing to fulfill His mind in all respects, and be obedient to his will. And that because Achilles shall not think my words as vaine, VVish him foorthwith to proue my mind, and find if J doe faine. Appoint some place (wish him doe so) and there my daughter she And J my selfe his louing friend will then attendant be. Achilles knowes that oft I doe to Hectors tombe repare, Apollos temple holds his bones, in which I haue a care To doe him rights as custome is (and yet the church did stand Jn greenish field without the towne, not far from Grecian band) In which if that Achilles will Polixena shall stay, And J my selfe will come with her to celebrate that day. Thus to the Grecian camps J sent my messenger in hast: VVho soone vnto Achilles tent in secrete manner past, And told him all that I had said: who presently with ioy Besturd his slumps, and was right glad my daughter was not coy. For that when first he made his suite, and did my daughter craue, The wench was coy, and thus replide: No Grecian she would haue. But now reuiude from former woe, the man with ioy halfe mad Did send me thanks, and ten times thanks, that thus had made him glad. J will quoth he be there indeede, to offer with my frends For Hector slaine, whose death I rue, yet vvill I make amends VVith some oblation to his ghost, right in his mothers view: That she may say, Achilles is become a frendfull true To vs and to the Troyans all, by souldiers faith J sweare, It shall be so vvhile life doeth last, this mind I still vvill beare. And then foorthwith preparde himselfe to offer to my sonne: VVhom he before had slaine, but novv did vvish the deede vndone. Meane vvhile vvhen that J knevv his mind, and hauing place so fit I did inuent in secrete sort to cry the Grecian quit. For slaying of my sonnes, and for a thousand Troyans slaine, VVhich vvere my frends, for vvhose sake novv such frendship I did faine. Then presently I cald my sonne, vvhom Fortune yet had sparde: And made him priuy of my mind, how that I had preparde To worke my foe a spitefull part when least he did suspect: And sure I was no liuing wight as yet could it detect. And thus I said, my louing sonne, euen as thou art my child, And hast a care to wish me well that am thy mother mild, And as thou knowest J tendred thee when Priam sentence gaue Thou shouldst be slaine, yet I as then sought meanes thy life to saue. Wherfore good Paris haue a care to ease thy mothers griefe: And that J pine in paine not long before I find reliefe. Which soon may be by thy good help, wherfore lay to thy hand: And shrinke not now in time of need, but to thy mother stand. Thou knowest my sonne (quoth J) how that thy brethren both are gone Whom well I loude, and now in Troy aliue there is not one That dares so valiantly in field against our foe to fight. But trembling we (thou knowest it well) doe feare Achilles might. Euen now the time is come that we may banish feare away: For that Achilles hath set down a certaine meeting day, To meet thy sister and my selfe, with others of my traine: What time the wretch doeth make account my daughter for to gaine. Apollos temple is the place where Hectors bones doo rest: VVhich stands in field vvithout our rovvne, a place mistrusted least. In vvhich Achilles mindes to be, and vovves if that he liue To keep the time, expecting then my daughter I should giue: So likevvise I haue promised, vvherfore my sonne geue ayd: Let not the terror of the Greek make Paris heart afrayd. But hie thee to the place, and there in secrete sort goe hide Thy selfe before Achilles come so that thou be not spide. With vveapon good prouide thy selfe against so fierce a foe, And vvhen thou spiest conuenient time then strike the fatall blovv, That shall procure the Troyans ease, and pleasure to thy frends, And pay the debt that Hector ovves to make the Greek amends. My sonne as vvilling as my selfe to vvork Achilles spight: Did soon consent to my request, and thether stole by night, And closely by his brothers tombe himselfe he did conuay: And there vntill Achilles came in secrete sort he lay. Polixena my daughter faire in gorgious vvise I clad: For that J knew her pleasant hue would make Achilles glad. According to appointed time we passe the Troyan gates With certaine of the Troyan dames, we had no other mates. And to the temple straight we hide, where we Achilles met, According to the place and time which he before had set. Then did the Greek vs Troyans greete, he faind a sober cheere, And said he grieud at Hectors death that was so braue a Peere. And further that he knew his death was to his mother paine, And to his sister whom he loude, wherfore (quoth he) againe, I am content to make amends for that which J haue done. And that in stead of Hector slaine J mind to be thy sonne. And for assurance of the thing, by Ioue he did protest, That after this (by his good will) the town of Troy should rest From further war, and therwithall his loue he did embrace, And fixt his eyes in doting sort vpon my daughters face, Not fearing any future hap, nor doubting any ill: For that in all respects we did according to his will. Which Paris spide, behind the tombe, when hand in hand we went. His sword prepard with mighty force, through back and side he sent. That down Achilles falles right soon all groueling on the ground: From gored sides the bloud did flow foorth of his mortall wound. There lay the wretch that earst we feard, now breathing out his last Whom Paris wild to eager curres should presently be cast. For vsing of his brethren so in such despitefull wise: Their bodies dead he did abuse before their mothers eyes. Wherto my sonne sir Helenus by no meanes then would yeeld How that the body of the Greek should lie in open field, Where beasts and foules might feed their fill: but craude the Greeks might haue: The body of their slaughtered friend to lay in resting graue. Which thing was done, though vndeserud on vile Achilles part, That euer sought by spitefull meanes to slay my wofull hart. Then home we came with this reuenge more mery than before: For well we wist Achilles fierce should neuer hurt vs more. Now Fortune faund on me awhile, awhile it was indeed: For that the angry Gods against me wretch had still decreed. Achilles dead, the Greekes afresh fierce war did vndertake: And vowed reuenge on all my frends for slaine Achilles sake. And on my daughter chiefe of all for working them such spight: VVith one consent on either part they faithfull promise plight. If that in case our towne they take, wherof before they boast My daughter they will sacrifice to dead Achilles ghost. But hauing slaine so fierce a foe the Troyans all were glad. And craued the field against the Greekes, who now remayned sad For losing of so braue a Peere, who was their chiefest ayd, Wherfore to fight with vs we thought the Grecians were afrayd. Yet were we all deceiude for that more fiercer than before The Grecians fought, that down there falles on either side great store. Their rage was great for to reuenge the death of this their Peere: And fiercely fought in desperate sort, as men without all feare. At last I climde to wonted place where often I had been: Yet neuer there but some mishap by me poore wretch was seen, From whence I viewd the bloudy broyle which grieude me to behold How that the Greeks and Troyans stout in bloud together rolde, At last J spied where Paris was (my sonne) who then did chase A Grecian Peere, Sir Aiax stout, who fled before his face. Not Aiax Telamon I meane, but Oelius Aiax he Whom Paris chas'd in open field that all the Greekes might see. At last the Greek receiud a wound though he full swiftly flew: For that my sonne the flying chase did eagerly pursue. A greeuous wound it was indeede, for Aiax feeling paine By flight could not preuaile, wherfore perforce he turnde againe, And did encounter with my sonne who first had made him smart: And with his sword (O haples hap) strake Paris to the hart. There died my sonne before my face, which Helen well doeth know Who stood with me when that her mate receiude that fatall blow. The Greek like bedlem beast layd on, for dolor of his wound, And stabd my sonne through back and side, starke dead vpon the ground. Whose corps when that the Greeks had spied, with mighty force they run To haue a part of Paris dead, for his offences done. For well they knew he was the man that stole their Prince his wife: Which was the chiefest cause of all that bred that bloudy strife. VVherfore each Greek to haue him dead did mightely contend: And sure had got my sonne, but that the Troyans did defend The mangled corps of Paris dead, and kept from Grecian force My sonne whom they would faine haue caught to plague his senslesse corse. VVhose life was gone they right well knew, but they like hellish hounds Did hunt to haue his carkas dead to plague with grieuous wounds. His senslesse corps they could not hurt, yet they as men starke mad: Of worldly wealth would geue great store so that they might haue had Aliue or dead, or but a part, to satisfie their will: Forwell they wist he was the man that did Achilles kill, Wherefore they fiercely fought to haue the body of my sonne, Who slewe Achylles traytrously, and first that warre begunne, But by the ayde of Troyans stout in maugre of their might, The body of my sonne was brought foorth of that bloody fight, Whose corps was laide before my face a grieuous sight to see: The armes and legs which Greekes hewde off, was likewise brought to mee, The pale aspect of this my sonne did mortifie my minde, That downe vpon the corps I fell, in hope some ease to finde, For willingly I would haue dide, to finish vp my care, The gods denide it should be so, but still my life did spare; For further woe and miserie they meant J should abide, Which would to God J had not seene, but that J then had dide. Faire Helena for this her mate in wofull sort did morne, Who was the cause that all the Greekes against our state had sworne, All Troy was sad for my hard hap they waile on euerie side, Both olde and yong through euery streete, in mournefull manner cride. His funeralls and other rites in order al well done, And Troyans al had wailde their fill for losse of this my sonne: Then Helen faire her sorrow slackt, by course of weeping tearse Her beauty bright to DeiphÅbe, in secret sort appeeres, So that the man halfe mad for her doth earnestly require The Grecian Dame, and that he might foorthwith haue his desire: He was my sonne, wherefore as then I seemed well content, He had his choice, but then ere long the acte he did repent: The Greekes that knew how al things went came fierce againe ere long. When they had filld their rankes with men to maintaine battaile strong, And gaue sharpe siege to Troyan walls which Troyans did defend; From that time foorth the angry Greekes no idle time did spend, But day by day did still inuent to worke our great annoy, And plots did lay how to betray the stately towne of Troy: For now they found no force preuailde against so strong a towne, Their hope was past, by open force to beate our turrets downe, Though diuers of our states were dead, and men of great account, The Grecian peeres which Troyans slewe our number did surmount, Our losse was great and ouer great, whereof the Grecians bost: We also knew what mighty states the Grecian army lost, Yet were we strong and strong enough for all the Grecian states, And dayly put their men to foile before the Troyan gates: Which well they spide, wherefore at length, by secret meanes they sought To take our towne, and with our states full priuily they wrought, They promise that these traytors vile, should haue their goods and liues, And all their friendes (whome they thought good) their children and their wiues Should freed be from sacke or spoile, if that they would betray Both Prince and towne into their power, to be a Grecian pray. Ãneas that disloyall man especially I blame, And false Antenor, who at first consented to the same, Both vile disloyall wretches they thus to betray their King, And Grecian armies set in rankes within our towne to bring, But sure J thinke the gods decreede at first it should be so, Wherefore I lesse do blame these men for bringing in our fo. Fell destinie so frownd on me, wherefore this latest fate Was first decreede for Paris fault, against King Pryams state, To plague me oft with wofull sights, to see my children torne, Both planets sure, and fortune vile against me wretch had sworne. Our towne betrayde, not knowing as yet, til after, when too late, For that the Greekes with mightie troups were entred in the gate In silent night, by helpe of friends when Troyans were at rest: They marched on, for well they knew the lowring night was best, For this their subtile policie: when we to rest were laide, The Greekes came in, our gates were ope, loe thus we were betraide. Now was my woe afresh renude, my miseries forepast To this mishap a trifle was, but sorrow now full fast In spitefull wise did shew her force, to vexe me more and more: And fortune frownd in worser sort than she had done before: For now my friends and deere alies in paued streetes so wide Besmerde with blood do gaping lie, as they to succour hide. The conquerde towne which then was lost in vaine they sought to saue, With rankes of men not armde for haste, they lusty larums gaue, But al in vaine was this their force for that the Grecians fell, With murdring minds so laide about, a greeuous thing to tell, And so behact and hewde our men vnarmed as they stoode, That like to streames the Troyans streetes did flowe with gory bloode: There lay the States and Peeres of Troy, whome angry Greekes had slaine, For that they thought to saue the towne which Grecians meant to gaine. Thus passing vp our stately streets, such mighty spoile they made, So that I thinke it grieude the Greekes in Troyan blood to wade, Yet for because we had abusde the Grecians in such sort, The slaughters vile of guiltlesse men was to the Greekes a sport: At last when all the towne was wonne, the states for succour flewe To Pryams pallace, hoping that the foe would not pursue, Nor there to spoile the aged Prince for reuerence of his yeares, Who long had liude in Phrygia land, as at this day appeares. But they to reuerence aged yeares, so little had regarde, That Prince and Peere, both olde and yong by Grecians was not sparde, The pallace faire of Pryamus, the greedy Greekes beset With weapons bright, and fiercely fought, their hoped pray to get. There now the battaile great was vp, as if no place else where Had felt of warre, and die did none in all the towne but there, So mightily the Greekes did run, to houses tops we see The posts brake down, and gates brake ope, beset that none might flee, The wals with scaling ladders laide, and props for scaffolds hie, That vp hy staires they climbe, and backe they driue the darts that flie, To battlements full fast they cling, on battred walls they holde While Troyans downe vpon their heads the tops of towers rolde, Full fierce a while the Troyans fought, but al their force was vaine, For that the gods had vowde, there should no part of Troy remaine Vnconquered, and Pryamus the King of Troy should knowe, How that he did not wel when first he made the Greekes his foe. At last the gates too weake to holde, by force were opened wide, And fearefull foes with armour bright passde in on euery side. The peeres within right wel perceiude the cruel foes intent, Unable to withstand their force to dreadfull death were sent: Which I beheld from secret place where I my selfe did shrowde, And other moe that time with me, to saue themselues did crowde. My kinsmen deere and faithfull friends before my face they made To be as wood before the axe, and buckler to the blade, Dismembring them in wofull sort, a lamentable thing, And oft enquirde for Pryamus that they might kill the King, Which well I wist wherefore from thence my selfe I did conuay, And word did send to Pryamus, that there he should not stay But seeke someway by priuy doores to scape their bloody hand, And not to bide amongst their force, nor to their mercy stand, And then into the streetes I passde by secret wayes vnknowne, Where chanells deepe (ah grieuous sight) with blood was ouer-flowne, And martred men scarce dead did lie, there breathing out their last, A worser hap then this I spide, as I by chaunce did cast Mine eies aside where I perceiude sir Menelaus he, Jn armour bright, so lyon-like fast marching towards me, And as he came, he soone had spide how DeiphÅbe my sonne Made haste to shun his cruel hand, and swiftly thence did runne For that he feared the desperate foe, and knowing iust cause why, Made greater haste to saue himselfe, and fast away did sly: The Greeke despising that my sonne of al the rest should scape, Because he held his lawful wife, he would reuenge that rape: For when that Paris late was slaine, then this my sonne did take Faire Helen Menelaus wife which did against him make, And now before my face this Greeke my louing sonne had cought, Whom be before through all the towne full egerly had sought To make him rue his former deede: and Paris being slaine, He vowde my sonne that held his wife, should yeeld her vp againe. Lo thus (I say) before my face the greedy Greeke there helde My sonne, who to the bedlem beast in humble sort did yelde: But he in steade of clemencie did shewe his cruell minde, My sonne that yeelded at his foote the tyrant vile did binde, His nose he cut, his eares and lips, and plucked out his sight, His other limmes in spiteful sort, he did dismember quite: Take heere (quoth he) the due reward of Paris fault forepast, Thy brother dead, for if he liude, a worser plague should taste. Wherefore commend me to his ghost, and truely to him tell, That I for his offences vile did send thy soule to hell. And therewithall he stabde my sonne that willing was to die: Which thing once done, yet further griefe I chanced to espie, For presently right neare my sight it was my hap to see My daughter, whom full deare I loude, my sweete Cassandra she Most vilely to be drawne along, whose handes and feete were bound Jn spitefull sort by haire of head, they dragged on bloody ground, They hallde her still along the streetes, where gory blood did flowe, That when she past along by me, I scarce her face did knowe: But soone she spide me where I stoode, and lifting vp her eies, To haughty heauens, and for redresse in wofull sort she cries, And calls aloude to haue my ayde, when I my selfe had neede Of ayde, to succour my mishap, and that to haue with speede: Yet still she cryes, O mother, helpe, lay to your helping hand, Let not this Greeke misuse me thus, while you on looking stand, But rather seeke to succour me from this vile tyrant wilde, And saue me from this cruell Greeke that mindes to force your childe: Sweet mother help (quoth she againe) get Troyans to defend Me thus abusde But she in vayn her wofull voice did spend: For I my self did quaking stand, expecting still the end; Amongst my foes I there was placde, I could not spie a frend. Yet following fast my daughter deere to see what might betide: Who still for ayd on me poore soule, continually cride. To Pallas temple she was drawn, in Troy a sacred place, And there my daughter was abusde before her mothers face. That bad vngodly Greek did deale with her, and did abuse The holy place with such a fact, her body to misuse. Which when I saw I could not stay to geue the looking on, But cried aloud for Troyan ayd although I could get none. That holy temple was defilde with such a filthy deed: For which offence that wretch ere long vnhappily did speed. Away I trudgd opprest with grief, vnable to geue ayd, Or to reuenge my selfe on him that this vile part had playd. And as I past from place to place, it was my chance to see A hundred of my daughter-lawes which did enquire for me. And quaking stood in open street with minds resolud to dy: For well they knew the wayes were stopt, that none away could fly. With wofull cries we wayld a good, down dropt the brinish teares But all in vain, for dreadfull death in ougly shape appeares. Yet lingring still in hope to liue, we seek to find reliefe: And rangde about in streets vnknown, which bred vs further grief. For as J past I might behold an altar huge to stand In open street, wherto we went to shun their cruell hand. A sacred place, where all our Gods were painted on a row: There throngd we thick about that place to shrowd vs from our foe. Which place we thought the angry Greeks durst not once be so bold Before the Gods our bloud to shed, wherfore on them we hold, And thought the Gods would vs defend, and priuiledge the place: And as a sanctuary safe to help in such a case. Thus sitting there, at last I spide old Priamus my mate: Who yet had scapt their murdring hand, but this his heauy state VVas death to me, yea death it selfe my husband deare to see So chacte as hare before the hound who fast for life did flee. The aged man whose quaking limmes could scant his body beare Had weapons got, and armour bright vpon his back did weare. His bending hams did beare the waight vnfit for Priams yeares: VVith speare in hand as if no state of Grecian land he feares. His manly mind was bent to fight, his feeble force to try: And he amongst his louing frends most willingly would dy. The heauy harnesse ouer huge my husband would assay: That being on, his speare in hand could scarce his body stay. But staggering stood, not fit to fight infeebled so by age: Yet he against his cruell foes in desperat wise did rage. VVhich soon J spide, wherfore as then I humbly did desire To rage no more, but seeme content, and pacifie his ire. I wild him then without delay to sacred place repare: VVhich thing to touch the greedy Greeks would haue especiall care. For that the Gods there present were to keep vs free from spoyle: VVhose presence what bold Grecian dares pollute with bloudy foyle. And therwithall in hast I drew him to the altar side, And set him down (old feeble man) but see what did betide: By this time Pryams pallace faire was yealded to the Greekes, And Pyrrhus fierce Achilles sonne in euery corner seekes For Priamus that aged sire, and for his louing sonnes: Jn hope to gaine them with the spoile full eagerly he runs. And hauing found Polytes out, in cruell sort did chase The fearfull youth, who for his life did trudge the streets apace. And comming where his father sate, there hoping to haue ayd: Yet scarcely come to wished place but that proud Pyrrhus stayd Our sonne, and there within our sight with churlish fist fast held: And presently in parents view Polites there he feld. There panting lay our louing sonne by breathles course neare spent: VVhile Pyrrhus stern his fatall speare through back and side had sent. That dying straight his hands vp held to take his last farewell: It makes me shrink to call to mind, and greeues me now to tell VVhat after did ensue, for that King Priam could not rest: VVith such a sight as commonly each father dooth detest. For to reuenge his sonne so slain he needs would take in hand: VVhen he (good man) vnable was with feeble age to stand, But he to shew his noble mind bad Pyrrhus proud pack hence: Forth of his sight, or els he would with speed driue him from thence. VVhat darst thou now thou wretch (quoth he) thus in my presence stay? VVhen that my sonne whom well J loude thou didst before me slay. And wilt thou stand to braue it out to breed me further paine? No that J will not sure digest, though J myselfe be slaine. And therwithall in feeble fist his speare he trembling held, Whose quaking lims by age opprest could scant his weapon weld. And at proud Pyrrhus he lets driue his hurtles speare (God knowes) Wherof strong Pyrrhus might haue born for need a thousand blowes. Achilles bastard borne (quoth be) by this I know thou art: That dares presume before my face to play so hard a part. Thou wretch, thou misbegotten wretch, that thus hast shewd thy kind For well I know thou art the man that bearst so bad a mind. With that (quoth he) Neoptolemus my fathers sonne, the same That was the bastard, and not I, for Pyrrhus is my name. And for because in time to come thou shalt not vse me so With these hard tearms, a token I will geue thee how to know My brother and my selfe apart, wherfore thou shalt enquire Ere long of slaine Achilles ghost to proue thy selfe a lier. And therwithall the spitefull Greek from sacred place did draw My noble mate by haire of head, contrary to all law. And through the bloud of his slaine sonne the aged man he drew: And right before our sacred Gods my husband deare he slew. With fatall blade before my face he piercde his tender side: That right against the Gods themselues my louing husband dide. The Gods no help at all would geue the Grecian to preuent: Nor that the Troyan Prince should liue, but they with one consent Did vow his death for former fault, and for his sinnes offence. No earthly wight for this his sinne could with their power dispence. But die he must it was decreed, and dreadfull death should end This bloudy war, that after none in like case should offend. My husband dead, I did behold a grieuous sight to see: His daughters all bewayld his hap which then did stand with me. The cellers deep and hollow caues with wayling all did sound: And from the hauty houses tops the Echo did rebound. Ah heauy chaunce to see him slaine who was my chiefest ioy: The Emperor of Asia great, and stately King of Troy. Who now lay slaine before my face, but being then starke dead: With louing zeale on Priam slaine my greedy eyes J fed. What hath this princox boy (quoth I) my louing husband slaine Beside our Gods without reuenge, what shall he still remaine Aliue, to vaunt of this his deed, or brag of such a fact Before the Greeks his cruell mates, who ioyes at this his act. Ye Gods, ye sacred Gods (J cride) although your wrath be great Against vs Troyans now subdude, whose ruine ye did threat For Paris sinne yet haue regard on Priam thus betrayd. VVho now is dead by your decree, wherfore his debt is payd. But now (quoth I) graunt my request, that this vile Greek may rue This cruell deed in time to come, that euer he so slue The aged King, for reuerence of gray and aged haires: VVhose youth was come by yearly course to old and aged yeares. Let not the slaughter of a King make proud his hauty hart: Nor that he long may make his vaunt of this so hard a part. But as your iustice now is seen, in so reuenging wrong: So Pyrrhus proud by your consent may rue this deed ere long. VVhen Priam thus by Pyrrhus sword had breathed out his last, And that the town was quite subdude by Grecians fighting fast, The Greeks demaund Polixena, because she first procurde Achilles death by fained loue, through which he was allurde: VVhom when they found, this Pyrrhus craude to haue my louing child That so had causde his fathers death by working such a wilde, But when she knew the earnest suite of fierce Achilles sonne: For succour to me helples wretch, with vaine hope fast did run. VVith clasping armes about my neck on me she cride for ayd, For Pyrrhus, dead Achilles sonne, had made her sore afrayd. Help mother now at need (quoth she) still weeping on my brest: A place too weak, for greedy Greeks, for there she might not rest: Grim Pyrrhus with an eager look did teare her from my lap: VVith churlish fist he gript the girle, O hard and cruell hap? That still mine eyes should witnes beare of this my wofull case, And that both mate and children deare should die before my face. By haire of head Polixena was drawne along the street: VVhere diuers of her wofull frends in sorrowing sort did meete To waile with her, for well they wist to dreadfull death she went. Achilles death now to reuenge they knew proud Pyrrhus ment. And as they thought it came to passe, for Pyrrhus did deuise, Vpon his fathers tombe as then my child to sacrifise Vnto the ghost of his slaine Sire, his death to recompence: And that Achilles ghost might know it was for her offence. Polixena so halde along by such a cruell foe: VVhat should become of this my child as then I did not know. VVherfore to see I followed fast what would to her betide: VVhere round about Achilles tombe a troup of Greeks J spide, Which readie were to giue their aide if need should so require, My daughters death with one consent each Gretian did desire: And there before my face they bound both hand and foote full fast Of this my child, that willing was of bitter death to tast. But hauing spide me where I stood, her hands and feete fast bound, Jn token of her last farewell, her head towards me she twound, And fixt her eyes on me (poore wretch) with such a wofull looke, With nodding head for want of limmes, her last farewell she tooke. Then Pyrrhus mad vntill reuenge did drawe his fatall blade, And slewe my child vpon the tombe, which he before had made In honour of his father dead, and there with gorie blood Imbrewd the graue: which cruell act did all the Gretians good. These words he spake which well I heard (quoth he) take here thine end, Thy soule vnto my fathers ghost for thine offence J send, And for the fault of Paris slaine, King Priam late did rewe His sonnes vile part; for with this hand the aged man J slewe. O fortune vile, that sparde my life to see this wofull day, My friends starke dead whom Grecians slewe, in euery corner lay, Not one was left to comfort me that could my woe redresse. But mourning matrons whose hard hap increasde my heauinesse, And last of al the angry Greekes to breede vs further care: The traytours of our common wealth, from sacke or spoile they spare: Ãneas, and Antenor he, those that betrayde our towne, In conquerde Troy had liberty as walkers vp and downe, The spoile once had our stately towne with fire fierce did flame: The gods decreed my life should last that I might see the same, Then did I see our lofty towers consumde with fire to fall, In burning houses children cride, which number was not small: A world of woe to call to minde the latter spoile of Troy, When Greekes with fire our City great did vtterly destroy, Fierce was the flame on euery side, downe falls the buildings faire, The temples of our sacred gods the fier did not spare, Till all things flat vpon the ground did lie like desart plaine, For memorie of this our tovvne the vvalls did not remaine, Dovvne to the earth it smoking lay defaced so vvith fire. To ruine novv all things vvere come vvhich vvas the Greekes desire, The bodies of the Troyans slaine in Zanthus floud did svvimme, Eche channell deepe vvith crimson blood stoode floting to the brimme: The members of our martredmen in barren fields they flung, Jn fertile sort to fat the earth in steade of other dung, That where the towne of Troy did stand in little space was seene Where houses stoode there grasse did growe in sprouting sort full greene; And where the Temples of our gods in stately maner stoode, The dockes and weedes were cherished by losse of Troyans bloode, No place of Troy vntoucht did stand, but all for waste was layde: The Greekes cride quit with that vile part that Paris first had playde. When that mine eies had seene all this the sorrowes which were past, Eche wofull hap once callde to minde, starke mad J fell at last, And raging in the fieldes I ran where lately Troy did stand: From thence when J had raylde my fill, I passde to Thracia land, Where Polymnestor that vile wretch and traytor bad did raigne, Who had betrayde yong Polidore my sonne for filthie gaine. Which cruell acte (though then starke mad) in minde I still did beare That for reuenge on him I fell, and out his eies did teare, To worke him woe for this his deede my frantike minde was fierce, The cheekes of this disloyall wretch my nayles did soundly pierce, That he foorthwith had lost his sight for this his former deede. O would to God all traitours thus for treacherie might speede: This deede once done, my troubled minde somewhat I did appease, For wel I wist the wretch was blinde which did my sorrow ease, And also to my further ioy proude Pyrrhus lost his life, When he returned home to Greece by reason of the strife That stout Orestes had with him for Hermion that wench, That nothing else but present death could this their quarrell quench: Achylles sonne at last was slaine, Orestes had his ioy. And Pyrrhus might repent the time that first be came to Troy, Where he imbrewde himselfe with blood, and slewe the aged King, Which was the cause of his mishap, and sure no other thing: The gods that knew his cruell minde, and saw his wilfull fact Could not lesse do than make the Greeke repent his bloudy act. Orestes slue Achylles sonne, thus Pyrrhus being dead, Like hearbes to pot his flesh was chopt, no otherwise he sped: This newes to me some comfort was in this my wofull state, To heare what hard mishap befell to him that slue my mate. And well I wist his father first for vsing me so ill Was slaine himselfe by my consent, for Paris did him kill: And also how that Thracian King that Polymnestor hight, For so betraying of my sonne, and doing me that spite, Receiude a guerdon for his fact, his lumen lights he lost, Wherefore the traytor of his gaines, I thinke, could scarcely bost, Of all the rest it did me good, for that my hands had done Such due reuenge on that vile wretch that so betrayde my sonne. I ioyde a while at this my deede my sorrow wel did flake, For that I knew they dide the death of whom before I spake. But when againe I callde to minde my children that were gone, And deere alies, of whom the Greekes aliue had left not one: And how olde Pryamus my mate before my face did die On Pyrrhus blade that Grecian grim, while I in vaine did crie For helpe, to free him from the hand of this his spitefull fo, In vaine I cride, for that the gods decreede it should be so. And then when that I thought on Troy, on Troy our stately towne, Which was the eie of all the world, but now by Greekes throwne downe, And like a desart place did lie, no signe of Troy did stand: The empire stout of Asia great, so wrested from our hand, That I the greatest Queene on earth, so was my stately stile In time forepast, and now to be a helplesse wretch most vile: So base and humbly was I vsde farre from my former state, That harborlesse I rangde about, this was my haplesse fate. Despisde of all, receiude of none, refusde of those that faund On me before, when I their Queene did euery thing commaund. But now, although I vsde them well in elder time before, They to requite my courtesie did shut me foorth of dore: And let me lie without reliefe, this kindnesse they did showe; Jn Princes place, to me they sude, but now they would not knowe Their haplesse Queene in miserie, but let me raging runne In euery corner where J would, eche wight me wretch did shunne: Not Greekes I meane, but subiects mine, who sometime did professe In Asia soile me for their Queene, and now in this distresse The Greekes had awde their minds so far, they durst not on me looke: But as a thing that venyme was eche liuing wight forsooke: Which when J spide, and callde to minde my former stately place, And now againe did see my selfe to liue in such disgrace: In frantike sort my heart was vext, the anguish of my minde, Like bedlam beast did make me run the spitefull Greekes to finde That were the causers of my woe, that J reuenge might take On all the wrongs that they had done, and for my husbands sake, Whom they had slaine before my face, and for my children deare, For whose sweete sakes, amongst the Greekes I went without al feare, With eger fist I laide on loade, with nayles, and feete at length, But slender hurt, a womans hand could do to men of strength, Yet notwithstanding my good will was seene by this my force And theirs againe (O wretched me) by vsing such remorce, For when that I had done my worst, and shewed my vtter might, And breathlesse stoode for want of breath by this my feeble fight, The Greekes with stones did compasse me, whose force J stil defide, Till they with stones did strike me downe, where presently I dide. Lo thus, when that all vile mishaps had chaunced vnto me, Whome fortune followed to the death with such extremitie: And that mine eies (to my great griefe) such wofull things had seene, But would to God before the warre long time I dead had beene. When all such haps of hatefull dome that fortune could assigne Did chaunce to me by haplesse hap, such luckelesse lot was mine, To ende my dayes in great disgrace J dide among my foes, They stoned me to death (poore wretch) a heauy end God knoxes, Had euer any such mishap since first the world begunne, Or any one did know such woe that liued vnder sunne, As J my selfe (poore wretched Queene) though bootelesse now J mourne, For remedlesse the cause remaines when Planets all had sworne, And haughty gods to worke me woe for Paris filthie sinne, Who would to God had dide the death when life did first begin: Or would to God (I wish too late) the waues had beene his graue, When he to Lacedemon went faire Helen for to haue: O Neptune fierce couldst thou not frowne and Eolus out call, With whirling windes to drench his ship, his company and all, But safely so to suffer him to swimme with gale at will. The doting youth in prime of yeres, his fancie to fulfill, In Simois and Zanthus flood, his ships did seeme to saile: So quiet was the seas as then because he should preuaile. What, did ye seaish Gods decree together with consent, To plague the Troian state so farre, as angrie Pallas ment? Ye Gods that rule both land and sea, why did ye thus decree, That Neptunes towne, at first so cald, to Greekes a pray should bee? If otherwise ye ment at all, his ship should not haue past So quietlie through surging seas by helpe of Boreas blast: For Triton mild did shewe his face so happilie that day, That Paris past with sprouting sailes into the Gretian bay. What was become of Palemon, did Glaucus hide his head? Their swift recourse far from his ship in partiall sort was fled. The Siren coucht Antiphates Parthenope was gone That wonted were to keep their course, but novv there vvas not one, Not Circe nor Calipso vvould their vvonted magike vse: Although they knevv the lecher meant Atrides to abuse. So Zephirus and Euras fell, with Aquilo did lurke: And hid themselues while Boreas with frendly gale did work. Nereides were past away, Lutonas imps did shine. Ech thing did smoothly smile that day by help of Gods diuine. And all was for the Troyan wracke, to plague my sonnes offence. For Paris needs to Greece would goe, and soon returnd from thence. But would to God the brinish seas, with raging waues so wild Had drownd that baud that Theseus first in filthy sort defilde: And that my sonne had dide with her before he came to shore: Then Troy had stood and flourisht still, as long it did before. But Helen Menelaus wife that was sir Paris ioy, VVas first occasion of our woe, and latest fate to Troy. O would the tygers first had torne the lims of this my sonne, VVhen aged Priam sentence gaue on that which was not done. The cause wherof was mine own deed which act J now repent: For that the Oracle did shew before the boyes intent. But now I know I wish too late the angry Gods had sworn To plague our state for some offence. For Paris being born, VVhose desteny the Oracle did openly declare, And yet to see, my hap was such that wicked babe to spare. VVho was the cause of this mischaunce, and breeder of our woe: His death had been to vs a life, and life to thousands mo. Yet I for pitie sake would not consent that this my boy The tygers brood his tender lims should vtterly destroy. VVhat power diuine did hinder me, or what infernall fiend? VVhat did both heauen and earth to this their vtter forces bend? O what offence did we commit that all the Gods should frowne: And thus decree with one consent to pluck our Empire downe? Did they appoint that I should breed, and foster in my lap A scourge to plague the parents sinne, and cause of their mishap? VVas it king Priams fathers fault that Laomedon bad That builded Troy vvith borovved coyne? for he receiued had Of Neptune and Apollos Priests a summe of money great, And when the day appoynted came, the wretch forsware the debt, With mighty vowes the periurde man at altar side did say He borrowed none to buyld his walles, and therfore none would pay. But whether twere for periurie, or for my sonnes offence I cannot tell, but well I know it was a recompence For double and for treble sinne, so many thousand dide: From Nations far the world dooth know the people thether hide In hope of pay to either side great troupes of men did run: But what was gaind saue deadly fight? or what but death was won? Did euer any feel such woe as J poore wretch did tast? Did euer Fortune yeeld such lookes as she on me did cast? O hauty Gods what hap was mine to feel such bitter paine? Did destiny assigne me that, to make me thus complaine? I would that I had been vnborn, or borne I dead had been: For then these wofull miseries J wretch had neuer seen. Why did the Gods cause me to liue? why did they thus decree? Was this their will that J should liue with present eyes to see My louing mate and children slaine, and Troy to burn with fire? If they did will it should be so, then they had their desire. But fie on that vile destinie, O fie on that hard curse: The Gods themselues could not deuise how they should plague me worse. And then with wringing hands she wept, with wayling voice she cride: Which grieude me sore, about I turnd, where presently I spide An aged man both graue and grim for that he seemed sad: Right father like for grayish haires, with Princely robes beclad: Unto the wofull Queen he marchd, and thus in modest sort Began to quip her frantike mood as I shall geue report. What madnes now hath mooude thy mind (quoth he) O louing mate, That thus thou fretst against the Gods, and frantikelie doost prate? Can this thy fuming mind redresse, or cause the things vndone To be againe? No, if we liude againe we could not shun The Gods decree, wherfore be still shake off such heauines: Jn vaine it is to vexe thy selfe where cause is remedles. VVhat shall thy ghost that now should rest, in worldly cares still dwell: And thinke on things that earst were past, O plague far worse than hell. Then suffer thou thy ghost to take her quiet ease at last. And call thou not to mind againe that vvhich is gone and past. Thou knovvest our destinie vvas so, vve could it not preuent: For that the Gods to plague our sinne for some abuses ment. What should we kick against the spur, on swim against the tide? Or striue for that to haue at will which angry Gods denide? When I had sent my sonne to death, and that he should be kild, His life thou sauedst, wherfore thou seest that destenie it wild. But J to shun Simphlegades on Hebrus lake did light: And coasting from Charibdis gulfe on Scilla rock did smite. Thus seeking how all dangers great by counsell J might shun: Did vnawares ere that I wist to present perils run. Was J the cause that Helen faire with Paris came to Troy: No sure it was fell destenie, or fickle Fortune coy. For when the Oracle had told what hap in time should fall: I wild to take away the cause. For witnes now J call The sacred Gods who knew my mind, my sonne J would haue slaine. I was content my flesh and bloud the tygers chops should staine, Because I feard the prophesie, therfore I did consent. But what of that? the Gods themselues did hinder mine intent. For if the Gods decree it once, J know it will fall out: Let no man think the powers diuine by any meane to flout. Sir Satire sonne to Pariside, of Bosphore sometime king, Was wild by Oracle to shun a mouse of anything. For that a mouse should be his death except he took great heed: The Oracle did tell him flat his fate was so decreed. But he to shun the warned harme did slay the silly mice In field and town, that none might liue his death to enterprice: And in his land no man might dwell that mouse was cald by name: He sought each way to saue himselfe, he feared so the same. He stopt the holes of creeping mice in euery place full sure: For that the vermins by no meanes his death might once procure. Yet see the end, when least he thought of this forewarned harme: He wounded was vpon the brawne or muscle of the arme: For Musculus a little mouse in Latine we doo call: And Mus a mouse which Satire slew, as after did befall. A dagger piercd Sir Satirs arme right where the muscle grew: And muscle comes of Musculus, though then too late he knew. And Philip King of Macedon was warned to beware Of wagon or of wheeled coach: wherfore he had a care To keep himselfe from any such: he neuer could abide To come in coach for feare of that, but still on horse did ride. For all his care it so fell out he could it not preuent: He was deceiud, no running coach by this before was ment. For being slaine, the sword that slew the King was brought to sight And viewed well, where on the hilts a coach was grauen right. To Pelius it was declarde when that he chauncd to see One barefoot doing rights vnto his fathers ghost, that he Should then of death in danger stand, the prophesie was so: Because he should take heed of him, and shun the warned foe. When he was doing of his rights vnto his fathers ghost: His nephew Jason came by chance, whose right foot shoo was lost. And there vnto his grandsire dead the youth his dewes did giue. The vncle then with ielous mind not long did think to liue, For that he feard his neuew now, who barefoot there did stand. Should be the cause of his dispatch, wherfore he out of hand Did counsell Iason being young to Colchos Ile to sayle. To fetch the golden fleece from thence: wherin he did preuaile. His meaning was that Iason should be lost or drownd therin, The conquest seemd vnpossible the golden fleece to win. And for because he might not feare the prophesie forepast He shipt his neuew speedely, and sent him thence in hast. But Iason soon returnde again, and brought away the fleece: And brought Medea home with him to be old Pelias Neece. To Thessalie Medea came, and hearing what was done; Against the aged Pelias, she presently begun To practise treason at the last, and causd the aged sire By his own daughters to be slaine, this was for Pelias hire. For he that could not trust the man that was his kinsman near: But purposely did seek his death to free himselfe from fear. Had such a chance, ere that he wist. Medea did the deed. His ielous mind was chiefest cause that made him so to speed. The Oracle long time before did know old Pelias mind: Wherfore it told what destenie was to the man assignde. Of fiftie daughters Danaus to be the sire was knowne: Ãgiptus then his brother had so many sonnes his own. Ãgiptus would haue all these his sonnes his brothers daughters wed: But Danaus would not consent, wherfore away hesled And tooke his daughters all with him, because he did suspect A sonne in law would be his death, therfore he did reiect The offer that his brother made, but why he did refraine: The cause was thus, the Oracle did say he should be slaine By him that was his sonne in law, wherefore he sought to shunne Such destinie as might befall through such a wicked sonne. Ãgyptus wroth with this his deede, did send his sonnes to stay Their vncle that before was fled, and pact from thence away. His sonnes according to his will old Danaus did take, And causde him there against his will a marrige day to make: His daughters all were wedded then against their fathers will, Eche man his cousin germaine had, Ãgyptus did fulfill His mind at last, and did reioyce in this so strange a match. But Danaus not well content, did worke a swift dispatch, Because he fearde the prophecie, least that on him should light: He did commaund his daughters all they should appoint a night, Wherein eche one with willing minde her slumbring mate should slay, And disappoint the prophecie before the morrow day: His iealous minde did vexe him so, he still did doubt the worst, Til it was done he could not rest, the man did so mistrust: According to the fathers minde they did commit the act, The nuptiall bed was so defilde with such a filthie fact, All sauing one was slaine that night, a hard and cruel part, Whose life was saude, for that his wife did wil him thence to start, For very loue she bare to him, though all her sisters had Destroyde their mates, which deede she thought to be right vile and bad. Thus being saude by such a meane, the sonne in law did wexe Right fierce against his father law, and earnestly did vexe, He vowde reuenge on Danaus, that thus vniustly delt, He swore that he should taste the same that they before had felt: And in the end he slue the wretch, for doing of that deede: The Oracle pronouncde before how Danaus should speede, Thus seeking how to shunne his fate his death he did procure, Himselfe was cause of his dispatch, when he thought all things sure. The Theban king that Laius hight by Oracle was tolde, That Oedipus his onely sonne would proue a man too bolde, And in the end should be the death of him that was his sier. But Laius thought to frustrate that, and proue his god a lier, Unto a shepheard of his owne his sonne he gaue to slay, And chargde the man vpon his life, there should be no delay, But presently his sonne to kill and bring him home his heart: He shall not like so long (quoth he) to make his father smart: The shepheard tooke the lad a field, but loath he was to kill His Masters sonne that he loude well, and yet he must fulfill His masters minde, which grieude him sore, wherefore he did inuent How he might satisfie the King, and saue the innocent. That Oedipus were dead he wisht, so that his hands were freed From doing hurt vnto the youth, and from so vile a deede, Wherefore the hurtlesse lad he tooke, his legs with twigs he bound, And by the heeles vpon a tree he hung him from the ground, That no wilde beasts might reach the childe his tender limmes to teare, He would by no meanes do the deede, but did the infant spare: And yet he thought, how that ere long the boy must needes be dead, But by that meanes he sought to free his hands from vile bloodshed: He killde a pig, and tooke the heart, and brought it to the King, And blooded certaine linnen clothes in token of the thing, And tolde him that his childe was dead, and there he might behold The heart and heart blood of his sonne, wherefore he might be bolde To banish feare, for this his childe should neuer him molest, For he was dead and dead againe, and therefore he might rest. Now see the hap that to this man did afterward betide, For Phorbas king of Corinth soile, by chaunce that way did ride, VVho spide the child as then aliue, which wofully did cry: VVith sprauling hands it reachd about, full near at poynt to dy. He causde his man to take it downe, to saue the infants life. Right glad he was, wherfore foorthwith he brought it to his wife VVho barren was, and had no child: then this as for her own She did receiue, from whence it came to them it was not knowne. The child did grow, they loude it well, and then in course of yeares Of noble linage comes the boy (quoth Phorbas) it appeares. For that the lad vvas dayly geuen to Martiall exercise: And did delight to take in hand some noble enterprise. At last king Phorbas sends his sonne vvith mighty men of vvar, To fight against the Thebane King, twixt vvhom there was a iar. Sir Oedipus in battell strong did vtterly confound The Thebanes, and to their king he gaue a mortall vvound, VVherof he presently did die: thus Laius had his end: The Gods that knew hovv all things vvent, such fate to him did send: And Oedipus his mother takes, and maries her in hast. No thing vvas knovven to him as yet that earst vvas done and past. Thus Laius dide by his ovvne sonne, no better could he speede: Jt is no striuing with the gods if once they haue decreed: Wherefore vexe not (O Hecuba) let not thy ghost so fret Against the gods for this their doome, and further do not thret Fell destinie or fortunes frowne, for this that they haue done, Was for some mighty sinne of ours, which fate we could not shunne, Or for the sinne of periurie, a vile and hatefull deede, Which first my father did commit, and now vpon his seede The plague did fall deseruedly for such his bad abuse, The gods themselues wil not accept for periurie excuse. And I likewise a wilfull man as al my deedes did showe, My wofull folly was the cause of this our ouerthrowe, For when the Greekes did send to haue faire Helena againe, I would not hearken to their sute, but pufft with deepe disdaine, Did flowt and mocke at their request, and openly denide Their iust demaund, which great abuse the sacred gods had spide, When that my sonne had tane away, sir Menelaus wife, A filthy part the letcher plaid, yet they to end all strife Would willingly digest that wrong, so that I would restore The Gretian dame that Paris stole from Greece not long before, And that no warre should once arise betwixt our Empires stout: So gently they did intreat, but if I went about To holde her stil, they threaten warre, and vowed by gods aboue, That they would sight to haue againe, sir Menelaus loue, Whom I perforce vniustly held, and stoutly did maintaine So vile a part that would in time cause thousands to be slaine, But J did giue them answere thus, I minde to holde her still, Not Greece, nor all the Princes there, in this shall breake my will. Let Agamemnon do his worst, I passe it not a straw: Let Menelaus fret his fill, my will shall be a law, And let them both with all their force against my power fight, J mind to holde dame Helen still, against all law and right: J haue her now, and here with me J minde she shall remaine, Let them not spare but fall to warre, and see what they shall gaine, The walls of Troy are strong enough, my power is not small, I ready am to fight the field when Grecian trumpets call. This will of mine was chiefest cause that did procure my smart, For J contrary to a lawe maintainde so hard a part, No reason would perswade my minde, true iustice was away, And wilfull follie helde the sword, selfe-will did beare the sway: The want of iustice was the cause that this our ruine wrought. What was the cause that Troy did fall, and so consume to naught, So many thousand men to die, was not my wilfull fact The chiefest cause that Asia, by Grecian power was sackt? What Empires great and kingdoms wide, hath ruine ouer runne For want of iustice and good lawes? Or what hath Princes wonne By such default but present death? The world doth witnesse well. What mortall man that wilfull was but so to him befel? The mighty CÃ¦sar ruling Rome, true iustice was debarde, His will was taken for a law, and iustice was refarde, His gouernement the Roman crew did priuily disdaine, They hate him so, that he ere long by subiects hand was slaine. Could Nero liue when he began to cleaue vnto his will, When Rome mislikt his gouernement, and found his deedes so ill? With one consent the Roman state decreede that he should die: Unworthy for to raigne in Rome his subiects all did crie And he that hated was, durst not vnto their mercy stand, But slewe himselfe, because he would not fall into their hand. And Philip, King Amyntas sonne, true iustice did neglect, And how to remed wrong with right the man had no respect, He partiall vvas for fauors sake, not passing vvhat vvas right: For vvhile he liud all Macedon gaue place to vvilfull might. The vvrongd might crie for remedy, vvhilst he did stop his eare: For vvhom he loude vvho durst accuse, as plainly did appeare. Pausanias vvhen he had sude vnto the King for grace: And found in vaine he did complaine, his suite could haue no place, He turnde his malice from the man that first had done him spite: And causde reuenge deseruedly vpon the King to light. For vvith his svvord he stabd the King, his folly to repres: Himselfe vvas cause of this his fall the dooer did confes. VVhat vvas the cause that Carthage fell and subiect vvas at last The Empire great of Affrica of Romane force to tast. Did not their vvilfull folly first their vvofull state procure? The vvant of iustice made the vvar a long time to indure, Vntill their Empire cleane vvas lost, their chiefest forces spent: That Carthage fell for such a fault the vvorld did much lament. Did Rome not fall for such offence? vvas she not ouerthrovven By Brennus Captain of the Gauls, vvhose force each vvhere vvas knovven. For Allia brook can vvitnes yet vvhere thousand Romans dide: The want of iustice was the cause, it will not be denide. If Empires thus and Princes fell, what makes thee thus to mone O Hecuba, and vex thyselfe thus walking all alone? Let them that liue in latter time example by vs take, Fret thou no more: from sobbing brest all wofull wayling shake. Thy troubled ghost dooth cry for ease, tis time, yea time to rest: Of Lethe floud now take thy fill, all things forepast digest. What furious fiend dooth vex thee now to double this thy paine? In life thou knewest all kind of woe. VVhat, will the Gods againe Cause thee to see another world? a world J meane of woes, When thou hast felt such miserie in elder time God knowes. Tis past with vs and remedles, wherfore no longer mourn: Shall we reuenge the thing againe that long time since was worne? No, let it passe and greeue no more, thy griefe dooth come too late: Be now content with this mishap, sith Gods assignde such fate. And yet (quoth he) to angry Gods an humble suite I make. That they vpon the Troyan race will not reuengement take. There lies an Jle enuironde within the Ocean sea: Which Troyans woon in time forepast, and holds it at this day. For Brutus he of Troyan race made conquest of that land: The Giants then that there did dwell, could not against him stand. The people that inhabit there, and in the Iland dwell: Doe fetch their pedigree from Troy each Nation knowes it well. A homely brag for Englishmen, to them a foule disgrace: To graft themselues on such a stock as was the Troyan race. But yet if they descend from vs, as they doe witnes still: I pray the Gods to keep from them the desperat Troyans will. And that they may not follow vs, but far from that digresse: To purchase them eternall fame: and for their quietnesse, Let this our death be life to them, that they may die with fame, Let Troyan wrack example be, vnlesse they tast the same, As we haue done in elder time: therfore let them take heed Lest that if wilfull folly raigne; accordingly they speed. And now (quoth he) O Hecuba, leaue off and doo not waile: Can vexing here in wofull sort, for sorrow past preuaile? Let sorrow passe, and banish griefe, the time is past and gone VVhen once a thing is remedles, then bootles tis to mone. If that I liude on earth againe, in time J would preuent, But time did passe without regard, too late I doorepent. And therwithall the graue old man in bitter sort did weep: He sighed sore from sobbing soule, his teares he could not keep. Thus Morpheus my fancie fed, that from mine eyes a streame Of teares did flow, which causde me soon to wake out of my dreame. And lying broad awake at last still musing in my mind: Me thought I saw dame Hecuba that had such fate assignde: And Priamus that aged sire me thought was still in vew: Their fauour and their faces both, as if before J knew What they had been: and now againe to memorie did call Things done before in drowsie dreame, as often doeth befall. And therwithall I tooke my pen to note what fancie vewde: And orderly did set it downe. Loe thus I doe conclude. FINIS.</field>
