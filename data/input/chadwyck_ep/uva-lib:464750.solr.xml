      <field name="fulltext">TO Richard Edgcumb, Esq;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pagination of the source document has been followed. A PANEGYRICK TO THE KING. In the Year 1697. Valiant, and wise, with Fame and Conquests blest; These Titles have by others been possest. Tamerlane, Cæsar, forty Braves before, As much have ventur'd, or have vanquish'd more. Fame's a cheap Prize, about in common hurl'd, The Lot of ev'ry Bustler of the World. Valour's a Vice, injuriously pursu'd, And Wisdom, oft, but Cunning to delude. These have been mourn'd in most, and might in thee, If Foes to Right, and Friends to Tyranny: If fraudful Counsels, to promote Thy Spoil, Labour'd ill-listning Nations, to embroil: If vain Ambition led Thy Arms, and Power Were but Thy wrongful Means to compass more; (Whilst the false Hero, frantickly possest, Others disturbing, gave himself no Rest.) But when Thy Arms, Thy Counsels, and Thy State, (To shew Thee truly and entirely Great) Protect, not harm, and bravely are apply'd, To raise the Prostrate, and to humble Pride; When those, and those alone, Thy Foes we find, Who too, are Foes of Nature, and Mankind; When all Thy juster Policies delight, Not to divide the World, but to unite; When chusing Peace, or animating War, The publick Good, is still Thy private Care; When thus Thou tread'st unquestion'd Paths of Praise, Pursuing gen'rous Ends, by gen'rous Ways; This noble Use, this Majesty of Soul Exalts the Rest, and dignifies the Whole: To Rarer Honour a Superiour Claim Erects, and gives Distinction to Thy Fame. Then, when the Nations view thy wide-stretch'd Pow'r, They view with Pleasure, and they wish it more; Joy in Thy Conduct, which so wisely knows To vanquish Obstacles, and frustrate Foes, An equal Stream, that silent flows and strong, Bears up all Weight, and drives all Force along; Thy Courage charms us then, or when to wield The Sword, it bears Thee boiling to the Field; Or when it wings thy gen'rous Hast, nor Stay Allows, tho' Nature would forbid Thy Way; Not letting Winter Winter be to Thee, But mocking Hazards of a frozen Sea; Where Ice, and Cold, Thy Ardour but inflame, And darkning Mists, give Lustre to Thy Fame. Then, fond of all, we every Talent bless, In each the Hero visible, confess; Then a shy Muse, that timerous of Praise, Wou'd to vain Idols, Altars scorn to raise, Her Incense brings, and daring Thee to sing, The Conqu'ror hails, the Peace-maker, and King, A King, whom Fate a Sovereign wou'd advance, Not by so low a Means as Birth, and Chance: A King petition'd to accept of Power, And rule a State, Thy Arms preserv'd before. Of old, when Perseus freed the lovely Maid, He set his Price, and bargain'd for his Aid: View'd the chain'd Beauty with desiring Eyes, And ask'd the Victim as the Victor's Prize. Nobler by Thee was the fair Isle reliev'd, Not claim'd and paid, but offer'd and receiv'd. Let those court Empire, who want Empire's State; The Hero needs no Throne to make him Great: Owes his own Arm, what Glory can afford, Nor Scepter sees so shining as his Sword. Him Empire courts, Kingdoms on him rely, And to His Sword, Scepters for Refuge fly. Sure Liberty we saw in Thy Command, Nor fear'd Protection from so strong a Hand; Whilst well we judg'd (nor did in vain depend) That he who could deliver cou'd defend. Th'Event has answer'd with so kind Success, We want no more, and Thou wou'dst give no less. Thou mak'st our Ends attain'd, our Wars to cease; Thou mad'st to us those very Wars be Peace. At Home secur'd, untroubl'd from Abroad, Hostility forbid, and Faction aw'd. Not so Hibernian Plains th' injurious Foe Escap'd, nor Caledonian Mountains so; A ruder Fate they found, their Sanguine share, Were Fields of Triumph, but were Fields of War. So tho' Jove rules, are harmful Tempests hurl'd, Vexing his distant and inferiour World: But where th' Imperial God his Court maintains, That Region's safe, there Peace unalter'd reigns: No Storm may rise, that Quiet to impair; Nor will he need to use his Thunder there. Such the sure Calm, so placid, and serene, Of our blest Seat has been the gentle Scene. Aloft Thy Shelter o'er the Land display'd, We sate below, and wanton'd in Thy Shade. If Danger e'er presum'd to grow more bold, It could not reach, and scarce alarm'd Thy Fold. Then too the Foe took care to let us see, From Thy watch'd Absence, what we owe to Thee. Car'd not t' approach, when we might have Thee here, But in his very Daring shew'd his Fear. Thus all own'd Thee, the Guardian of our State; By Thee made safe, and by Thee too made Great. Great, as when fam'd in noble former Days, Our War was Honour, and our Peace was Praise; Ere erring Int'rests in inglorious Times, Ease and Contention made alike our Crimes: Great, as when we so wisely knew to do Our own at once, and the World's Business too. Such are the Glories which thou dost restore; Such Policies, such Warfare, and such Power. England once more is England, and Thy Reign Has seen her act her brave old Part again; Ballance wild Power, that would too far prevail, Lend her important Weight, and poize the Scale. Again her Arms for Freedom have appear'd, Again in Belgian Plains been lov'd and fear'd, Her Youth rejoycing to the Field did go, To gain new Honours from her ancient Foe; Whilst under Thee she traffick'd for a Name, Dealt with vain Wealth for large Returns in Fame. Here cou'd she see a conquering Navy come, Full fraught with never-fading Laurels home: There how unrivall'd, th' Ocean all her own, She rode at large, triumphantly alone. As when a Soveraign Lion, sternly great, Ranges a Lybian Wast in martial State, His vanquish'd Rival sought, but sought in vain, Close in some sheltring Cave resigns the Plain. There if he hear the Conqueror dreadful roar, He shrinks in further, and he trembles more: Mindful of former Wounds, while no rash Heat Rises to tempt him to a new Defeat: Such was the Scene then on the watry Plain; So did Thy awful Fleets possess the Main. On Indian Seas thy Flags were seen renown'd, And mid-land Coasts heard Thy dread Cannon sound. Then how we lov'd to see proud States afraid! The Tuscan Duke, and Adriatick Maid Send, and make court, and fawn upon Thy Pow'r Which ill they thought not their Concern before. So, the Clouds heard to murmur from afar, The distant Sound mayn't give the Impious care; But as the rolling Terror moves more near, They shrink, and bow, and own the Thunderer. Let strong Ambition make the Nations bend, And o'er the Vassal Earth its sway extend, 'Tis narrow all to the unbounded Sea, And who reigns there, the mighty Monarch's He. Yet may not Oceans limit Thy Command; Lord o'er the Waves, Thou Conqu'ror art at Land. Kingdoms with Thee, Thy Armies have o'er-run, And Forts contriv'd, to mock Assailants, won; There, where no Bars cou'd their hot course restrain; But Hills, and Rocks, and Walls, and Troops were vain: Those too so strong, that these they scarce requir'd, So num'rous these, that ill they those desir'd. What Toils despis'd! what miracles perform'd! What threatning Works, how insolently storm'd! How easy 'twere the master'd World t' o'ercome, Once Pyrrhus said, for either me or Rome! For me with Roman Soldiers to my Aid, For Rome with me her great Commander made. What Hopes might then by Thee, and us be fed! By Thee so follow'd, and by us so led! If we at least can well the Romans be, More than the Pyrrhus, we possess in Thee. Like him unwearied, gen'rous Thou, and brave, Partak'st all Dangers, and no Toil wilt save. Like his, Thy Battles from their General shine, And Thy self wins the Vict'ries that are Thine. Like him thou know'st, but greater Things to gain; But unlike him Thou know'st too, to retain. His Worth obtain'd (when Fate wou'd on him smile) From willing Hands the fair Sicilian Isle; More has Thine done, and what his cou'd not do, Obtain'd Thy Island, and preserv'd it too. When Peace he offer'd to the Roman Pride, Claudius was heard, and Pyrrhus was deny'd; Thou had'st to Thee th'uncourted Proffer brought, And to Thy very Camp Thy Friendship sought: Then Peace was too a Bus'ness of the Field, And Armies saw the Gaul descending yield, Glad to compound, and let the World be free, Leave Thee Thy Kingdoms, and Thy Kingdoms Thee. 'Tis done, Contention and Debate are o'er, And Arms, and warlike Honours are no more. No more Thy martial Heat must warm the Field; No more Thy Sword needs be the Nation's Shield. No Boyne may now, compell'd to yield Thee way, Submit, and give a Kingdom with the Day. No Namure Tow'rs, that haughty mount the Sky, Shall stoop to raise Thy Trophies yet more high. But ruling Arts, and civil Conduct shewn, All that in Peace is by good Monarchs done; The Wealth restor'd which needful War hath drain'd, And Luxury, its softer Foe, restrain'd; The Nation's Int'rest watchfully pursu'd, The Court inspected, and the State review'd. Law which reform'd, shall Sense and Justice be, Nor vex'd with Arts, nor lost in Nicety; Commerce well settled, as well understood, Not rul'd by private Gain, but publick Good; These left Thee still, shall ample Glories bring, And tho' the Soldier's past, make great the King. Oh might we but hope too, (nor hope in vain) Our ancient English Manners to regain; Might Sterling Honesty once more be prais'd, Restor'd, and to its noble Standard rais'd; Then the Coin's fam'd Reform should be a poor Atchievement, and appear a Boast no more; The greater Glory should the less deface, To purer Virtue still the Silver Base. And this shall be, degenerate Fraud shall die, And artless Faith, and old Simplicity Revive, and banish all those thousand Ways, By which false Man his Fellow Man betrays. Then Golden Times shall once again commence, (The first but Plenty were and Innocence) Those Golden Times shall be acknowledg'd Thine, And, as our Money, with Thy Image shine; A Sett of Years which taking Rise from Thee, Shall make thy Reign another Epoche. What Poets then shall sing in grateful Lays, What happy Poets of those happy Days? How will they love the Beauties to reherse! The flowry Scene to paint in flowry Verse. Yet as they wander, in a gayer Strain, O'er the smooth Praises of Thy Halcyon Reign; Some too shall take a Pleasure to look back, And of a rougher Fame a View shall take; From Thy first Start deduc'd, Thy Deeds shall trace Through all th' Extent of the Heroick Race; Shew how Thy Worth Thy Way to Honour made; A Worth obscur'd, and breaking from a Shade: As when fair Light through hostile Chaos prest, And vig'rous ever since the Globe has blest; How at Thy Rise, surprize did all engage, To see Thee such, surmounting all Presage; Daring, yet Cool; conceal'd, yet no Disguise; Steddy with Youth, without Experience, wise. How Thy own Holland Thou so well didst free; By others lost, to be retreiv'd by Thee; How in a larger Sphere advanc'd to shine, The leagu'd Affairs of half a World were Thine! What Actions here? What Virtues shall they see? What Faith? What Spirit? And what Constancy? When with a Fabian Firmness, still the same, Thou kept'st Thy Course, slighting, and gaining Fame. Fixt in Thy Prudence, resolute to Thy Ends, Nor tir'd with mighty Foes, nor feeble Friends. Here, a fierce Chief shock'd in his conqu'ring way, Shalt Thou stem Vict'ry, and reverse the Day; There a forc'd Camp expiring War shall crown; An Act so bold it could be Thine alone. Grave, Narden, Bon, shall be renew'd to Fame, And all Thy Wonders a Regard shall claim. A thousand more of Brav'ry shall they find; A thousand of the Honour of Thy Mind; That Wrongs and Interest, cou'd alike disdain, And throw back offer'd Rule that wou'd its Brightness stain. Those Jars asleep, Thou shalt repose a while, Till new Alarms sound to re-wake Thy Toil. Then rous'd afresh, they Thee shall lead to War, With equal Ardour, and with equal Care. There later Scenes again shall full be shown; All that thou hast perform'd, and Europe known, Till now, once more of lovely Peace possest, She from Thy Labours re-injoys her Rest. So when black Southern Clouds begin to pour Impetuous down a wild destructive Show'r, Then from the North does the brave Boreas rise, A ready Champion, and asserts the Skies. What Conflicts then the suffering Air molest? The Plains above groan with the strong Contest. The Face of Heav'n shifts, various, to the View; Half clear it smiles, then gloomy frowns anew; The Wind persists, is obstinate and fierce; Till, tir'd, the Clouds grow willing to disperse; 'Tis Silence then; the warring Tempests cease, And the fair World, all calm, returns to Peace. A SONG, Occasioned by a Manuscript, one of Mr. Dryden's, since printed in the fifth Miscellany, by the Name of The Lady's Song. I The happy Day came in the Youth of the Spring, To which William and Mary new Honours should bring. The Rites were prepared, the Partners were crown'd, And from Earth the loud Joy did to Heav'n resound. The warm God of War, and the gay Queen of Love Took the jolly Alarm, and look'd down from above. They staid not to guess, or their Guesses compare, Yet He thought of the Brave, and She thought of the Fair. II They quickly perceiv'd they were both in the right, For the Fair, and the Brave were concern'd in the Sight. They view'd all the Glory, the Ensigns of State, The Pomp that did pass, and the Crowds that did wait. There Two they beheld whom a Throne had made One, Compleating what Hymen, and Love had begun. With Ease they distinguish'd so well known a Pair; Scarce the God was so brave, or the Goddess so fair. III Mars brighten'd his Air, she kind Venus did smile; They blest, and rejoic'd with their favourite Isle. Presaging new Triumphs of Arms, and of Love, They vow'd in this Cause to be Champions above; While he by his Sword, and she swore by her Eyes, That nothing cou'd be, or more just, or more wise. A Hero and Beauty the Scepter should bear, Where the Swains were so brave, and the Nymphs were so fair. Of the Death of the Queen. In the Year 1694. So Orange fell, so Gloucester went before; And She succeds to make thy Triumph more, The Small-Pox.Tyrant Disease, that may'st, with rude Success, Boast now the Death of half a Royal Race. In Blood, in Youth, in Worth, in Fate ally'd, Lov'd they all liv'd, and all lamented dy'd; But most the Queen, and justly She the most. As more the Kingdom, and as more She lost; Torn by Her rigid and severer Fate, Not from dull Hopes, or from inferior State; From Crowns possess'd, and from Imperial Sway, Of willing Nations, begging to obey. Which sought, with Great Nassau's, Her soft Command, And thought their Scepter grac'd by such a Hand. Ravish'd she went, from still increasing Pow'r, From tasted Triumphs, and from Hopes of more: As when of old, in some Religious Wood, A tow'ring Oak, that sovereignly stood, Mounting majestick, and sublime above The Rest, the sacred Queen of all the Grove, Down, thunder-struck, from all her Honours cast, (While branching yet, they had an Age to last) Fell a vast Ruin on the wounded Plain, Her the Bards mourn'd, her, every anxious Swain, That, faithful, there once glad Devotion paid, And sat with Joy beneath her grateful Shade; Concern'd for her, and her deploring more Than all, though noble they, that fell before; Griev'd to reflect, as they beheld her ly, How her tall arms but now possest the Sky; Tax'd Jove himself, that his Imperial Tree Should not exempt from his own Thunder be. Nor less do we, th' ador'd Maria's Fall Too hard, too cruel and untimely call; Dare, for Her Sake, ill-reverenc'd Heav'n accuse, Ask why such Victims Death hath leave to chuse; Say Tyrant, live and living, them we mourn, That they grow old who ne'er shou'd have been born; While those, whom Virtue renders Gods below, Whom we, like Gods, cou'd wish immortal too, Forsake our Hopes, and leave vain Years behind, Defrauded of the Blessings they design'd. Not ev'ry where is Nature thus severe, The needful Sun that from his beamy Sphere Cheers the glad World, a lasting State maintains, A thousand Ages past, yet still he reigns; While fatal Comets, whose portentous Flame Does Wars, and Waste, and ev'ry Ill proclaim, Like Meteors pass, their baleful Glories die, And they to better Stars resign the Sky. These are the murm'rings of the loyal Train, Whilst unconcern'd not Foes themselves remain. They lend (for who so savage to forbear?) A Sigh of Pity to the Young and Fair; To Beauty give what they refuse the Queen, Who must, t' have dy'd unwept, have dy'd unseen. But above all is the sad Poet's Woe; He grieves as Subject, and as Poet too. He saw Her Young, and hop'd to sing Her long, A shining Part in each triumphant Song, Which, with Nassau's, Her Trophies should record, And love the Eyes to equal to the Sword, Fond Bard! No more shall he the happy Birth-Day sing, Which gave new Pleasure to the welcome Spring; No more for Her th' illustrious Day shall greet, Which laid a prostrate Empire at Her Feet; Promise the World, prophetical in vain, Long future Joys in an united Reign. Only, while pious, to attend her Herse He brings the mournful Off'ring of his Verse; Her Fate condoling, the just Grief to raise, Once, this last time, he celebrates Her Praise; Tells Wonders of Her Face, and of Her Mind, How bright the Form, and bright the Reason shin'd; How lovely Looks, and a majestic Meen, Gave Her all Beauty's Title to be Queen; How, when she spoke, all thought it Heav'n to hear, Bless'd the soft Voice, and found the Goddess there; How She rais'd high, as high a Pattern shew'd, Of gen'rous Virtue set the noble Mode. With kind Indulgence waiting on Her Pow'r, So doing Good, as wanting to do more; With free Humility that crown'd her State, A brave Descending that exalts the Great. There haughty Nymphs, who, in a meaner Sphere, Proud of their Height, or of their Lustre were, Reproach'd, familiar Majesty to view, Such matchless Beauty, yet so prideless too, From conscious Shame a happy Cure did gain, Dismist their Scorn, and durst no more be vain. He adds the calm Sereneness of Her Mind, Like Æther rais'd above the Clouds and Wind: Her Charms still sweetning with perpetual Grace, A Spring of Joy immortal in Her Face. He adds the Soul that no Vain-glory knew, But scorn'd the Flatt'rer and the Flatt'ry too; The handsom Modesty, in Courts so rare, Which, Praise so well deserv'd, so ill cou'd bear; The Love She to the happy Consort bore, More worth than all the Crowns or Bays He wore. Nor he the Clemency forgets, nor he The Faith, nor he the well-known Piety. All, all he tells, Her ev'ry Praise imparts, Of vacant Hours shews the Palladian Arts; Describes the Nation copying from the Court, Work made a Fashion and become a Sport; While with no Dame, no Moments idly fell, Spent all, through very Affectation well. But then He mounts aloft to greater Things, Of Rule, of Courage, and of Conduct sings; Of gath'ring Faction silently suppress'd, And unfear'd Dangers, that appear'd and ceas'd: How when the King the threatned World would shield, And fled the Court, impatient for the Field, His absent Charge He emulous did sustain; He went to conquer, and She staid to reign. To reign? to guard, to war, to vanquish too, This, Gallic Shores and humbled Louis knew, His flying Ships that sham'd their haughty Names, And The Admiral-Ship of France was called the Royal Sun. Royal Sun's extinguish'd in her Flames. So the Athenian Progeny of Jove, Though she the mild, and peaceful Olive love, The skilful Goddess of each gentler Art, Yet shakes the Spear, and knows a martial Part: Troy fled her Arms, and taught by her to dare, Did bold Tydides wound the God of War. Who dares Her Honours impiously blaspheme, Or with Ambition tax the faultless Dame? By every gen'rous Winter better taught, To right Her Virtue, and correct his Thought. Oh! how we lov'd (that grateful Season come That brought the Lord of all our Wishes Home) To see the gen'rous Regent, cover'd o'er With justest Glory for well-manag'd Power, Fly all in Joy to yield up a Command, Which pleas'd Her best when in His dearer Hand. Not so th' Semiramis. Assyrian Queen, when regnant made, Advanc'd to Rule, th' Advancer she betray'd, By Guilt and Crimes too pleasing Pow'r maintain'd; The Husband dy'd, and the Wife impious reign'd; She knew to govern, while Maria knew To govern, and how not to govern too. Fair Cynthia so, when Phœbus does retire, Bearing to other Lands his pow'rful Fire, Then shines supreme, and with a sov'reign Ray Gives the forsaken World another Day, Rules o'er the Waves, and makes herself to be Confess'd the mighty Empress of the Sea. But when again his Beams he does restore, Silent she yields, and willing shines no more. Shares still the Heav'ns, and with an equal Right, But leaves the God alone to give the Light. Thus while he sings, fresh Glory does appear, But Glory this, that cost the World too dear, Glory, the Poet would be glad to hide, Sighing he hath to tell how Great She dy'd; How, when by sure Presage the Fate was known, Then She was dauntless, and then She alone. Not then her Hero knew to be unmov'd; He shrunk, and learn'd to fear for Her He lov'd. So trembled Mars, (with Him all Heav'n agreed) To see the Queen of Love, and Beauty bleed; On whose indulgent and diviner Breast The slumbring Soldier us'd so pleas'd to rest; Where peaceful Moments He did well improve, Relieving Toils of War with Joys of Love. But oh! when Life gave the vain Struggle o'er, And She, th' illustrious She, was now no more, Then the Muse spreads fresh Horror o'er the Place, A wild Confusion paints in ev'ry Face, Makes Nature, mourn Alluding to the Weather at that Time. while each astonish'd Flood Forgot to flow, and dull and stupid stood; With chilling Grief the rigid Earth does bind, And makes Air sigh in ev'ry murm'ring Wind. But oh! what Numbers may be found, what Verse The Royal Lover's Anguish to reherse? He bends, He sinks, He falls beneath the Weight, Threatning the World with yet a greater Fate. Then, only then, thoughtless the Court of Her, Their Sorrows found suspended in their Fear; While Sense, while Life from the Great Mourner flies, And lost, and silent, He not grieves, but dies. At last, as Art compell'd Him to revive, Implor'd and begg'd He wou'd endure to live: He grants, but still expostulating why The Bus'ness of the World gave Him not leave to dy. O Boast! O Honour! O unequal'd Fame! O happy Shade, and never-dying Name! What Charms, what Virtues must be Hers to move That Heart to such a Grief, and such a Love? Here, Poets, here use all your nicest Art, Dwell on the tender, and important Part. This Scene alone Maria's Fame shall raise; Draw well this Passion, and there needs no Praise. Of the Times after the Peace, and His Majesty's Death. How vain the Poet proves, when, to pursue Fond Hope, he ventures to turn Prophet too! Most Prophets warily indeed forecast, Predicting wisely what is safely past. More bold the Muse, whose sanguine Verse foretold The Rise of Virtue, with an Age of Gold; And Halcyon Times, and Blessings in Encrease, Th' Effect of Nassau's Rule, and Nassau's Peace. Fool, to hope steady Weather in our Skies; Fool, to suspect these Realms could long be wise. Long had we clogg'd His Arms with heavy Weight, By Councils slow, and by supplying late. Times yet discern'd, on old Reforming bent, Good Laws we sought, at least with ill Event. When Foes of War were weary, we grew tir'd, And prov'd in Peace just such as they desir'd. Stopping our Ears when the wise Charmer charm'd, In view of Rupture we ourselves disarm'd; And bravely shew'd we nothing knew to fear, But our Defence and our Deliverer. Loud Censures on Partition Treaties fall, That Bourbon Spain shou'd share, and not have all. Grants were resum'd to ease a burthen'd State, Or open to old Lords a Postern Gate; The Dream of Millions dwindling into Scorn, While scarce a Mouse is from the Mountain born. Court and Corruption grew the senseless Theam; We sought the Mote, and overlook'd the Beam. Tale after Tale some catch, and others fling, That tax'd the Ministry, and meant the King. Slaves of old Reigns now wanted to be free, Not from Oppression but from Liberty. Heady Republicans prepar'd the Way For the Return of arbitrary Sway. And English Churchmen (what was no new Doom) In Rage against Geneva, work'd for Rome. Thus happy Foes make us their various Sport, And gain our Factions, when they lose our Court. Still Nassau reign'd t' incounter all their Arts, And reign'd, tho' scarce we knew it, in our Hearts. For the most sinn'd with innocent Intent; But led, they saw not where ill Leaders went; While Country Zeal his Country's Foe pretends, And Traitors use their Sov'reign ill as Friends. With Grief and Scorn He on the Waves look'd down, That kiss'd the Banks which they advanc'd to drown. Like Belgian Digues. He gave a little Way, And soon return'd, and wore them to decay. To right Himself, He did our Errors chide, His Speech at passing the Disbanding Bill. And what could not be cur'd, He qualify'd. Sought Antidotes the Poison to defeat, And sweetly drew from the Devourer Meat. He sav'd his brave Commanders from Distress, (The Pillars standing made the Ruin less.) He for the Throne Succession did provide, He Gordian Knots of Foreign Friendship ty'd, And with His Nobles, an illustrious Band, Virtue He rescu'd from the Hunter's Hand. Thus Cordials did with Lenitives dispense, And waited for a free Return of Sense. It came; the Tempest serv'd the Mist to clear, And Men began in the right Place to fear. False Patriots then, expos'd enough to view, He off to Hatred and Derision threw; And His rich Stream no more oblig'd to wind, And creep and struggle through a Soil unkind, Got to soft Plains, and full from a new Source, Flow'd in an easy, and directer Course. The new Parliament in 1701, called upon the King of France's Proceedings after King James's Death.Thus cannot long eclips'd the Sun remain; Some Minutes dusk, and all is clear again. During that dusk, he in himself is bright, 'Tis we that want his intercepted Light. Whilst ev'n the Rests of his diminish'd Ray Serve to conduct the World and guide the Day. Then Night indeed the dark ascendent gets, Not when he shaded is, but when he sets. And oh! our Sun is set no more to rise; After too short a Day hath left our Skies. Brave Prince, with Faction He, and Force, and Hate Could deal; but there's no managing of Fate. The tender Frame sunk gradual to decay, And each Year nearer shew'd the frightful Day. Curs'd be the A Fall in Hunting. Chance that hurry'd it so fast, And cut a wearing Thread that could not last. What, not allow'd a Year, a Summer's Stay! To set us right in our new martial Way? To fix the Movement, and himself begin The noble Trial of his own Machine? Unite the diff'ring Nations of our Isle, And of new Successors enlarge the Stile? Methinks th' illustrious Scene I op'ning view, See the Old World commanded by the New, And fond Iberian Pride compell'd to chuse, To change their Monarch, or their Indies lose; Seiz'd the fam'd Cadiz, where some suppose his Pillars to have been. See Heylin and Ortelius in Verbo, Gades. Pillars of old Hercules, And our Fleet Sov'reign of Atlantick Seas; While France, encumbred with the Load of Spain, Sinks with the Weight in the devouring Main. Who now shall make the splendid Vision good? Who now conduct our Host beyond the Flood? For He, for He the Glory cannot have, Lost to our Hopes in an untimely Grave. Thus Israel, prone to faint and to rebel, For others Murm'ring their great Leader fell. He, who from Bondage sav'd them, and Distress, Through all the length of the wild Wilderness; Who charm'd the fiery Serpent's angry Bite, Withstood the Prince's Strife, and Levi's Spite; At last just ready for the great Contest To crown His Acts, and give the People Rest, View'd from the Mountain's Height the Lot design'd, (As Nassau from the Nebo of his Mind;) Then dy'd, oblig'd to leave to others' Care To pass the Jordan, and to wage the War. Brave Prince, farewel; on smooth Elysian Plains Thy Shade now marches, and Thy Spirit reigns; That Region Thine, where in the blissful Grove Dwell Patriot Kings, and Godlike Heroes rove. With Rev'rence all salute th' approaching Guest; Thy British Ancestors above the rest. Thee haste our greater Edwards to receive, And Thee our nobler Henries never leave. Eliza Thee delights to entertain, And joys to find Her Conduct in Thy Reign; Wishes such Feet had stood to mount Her Throne, Or Thine had been as lasting as Her own. Thee Thy Nassaus, Thy Orange Lineage meet, Thee Frederick, Maurice, William warmly greet; Embrace the Successor of all their Cares, Crown of their Fame, and greatest of their Heirs; Grieve such a Line no farther should extend, But joy so rich a Link the golden Chain should end. Thus they; while here the Worthy and the Wise, Grateful and sad, attend Thy Obsequies; Remembring all which Thou hast been before; Remembring all which Thou must be no more. Thee Europe, Thee thro' all Her Climes renown'd, Her Friend, her Counsellor, her Champion found; Owes to Thy Pains, that She so far is free From Kingly Chains, and Priestly Tyranny; At the last Stake her Fortunes twice retriev'd, Her Fate revers'd, or well at least repreiv'd. And now, too soon, Thou art at Rest, and far From Cares of State, and from Fatigues of War. But rest secure of everlasting Praise; Time cannot lessen it, but Time may raise. No Joshua, no new Deborah can yet Make thankful Men their Moses e'er forget. Of past Atchievements Thine was all the Care, And Thou in those to come shalt amply share. Thine the just Lines, Proportion, and Design, Fleets, Armies, all the strong Foundation Thine; And yet 'twill glorious be, and 'twill be great, Thy Piece to finish, and thy Piece compleat. But if new Schemes our Wishes shall deceive, Err from Thy Paths, and Thy fair Model leave, This for Thy Glory will too well contrive, When our dead Hopes the Want of Thee revive, And all o'erthrown Thy noble lovely Frame The Ruins of a World shall build Thy Fame. So Troy, secure whilst Hector was her Guard, Shew'd her Destruction was a Task too hard. He fell; too soon She sunk into his Grave, Her Counsels losing what Her Arms cou'd save; The Grecian Frauds prevail'd, and then 'twas known Who had preserv'd the State, and who alone. Directions for lamenting the Death and celebrating the Memory of His late Sacred Majesty King William. An ODE. Begun 1702. [The Poet is supposed standing by His Majesty's Tomb in Westminster-Abbey.] I. Come Poet, whosoe'r thou art, Whom Fate hath form'd and chosen for the Part, Fitted with ev'ry needful Excellence, With Heat, with Force, with Elegance, with Sense, With Virtue, (Virtue is herself concern'd, When Nassau's to be prais'd or to be mourn'd; The sordid Muse, that hath to vicious Praise Been prostitute, would but pollute his Bays) Come thou, and with thee bring thy richest Store; Here wilt thou want it all and more; Bring all thy Nature, all thy Art along, And listen to my Verse, while I direct thy Song. II. Not One must be thy Stile; the Theme's not One, But all the Hero was, hath born, hath done; His Toils, His Cares, His Injuries, His State; His War, His Peace, His Life, His Fate; The various Worth of His excelling Mind; The diff'rent Views in which His Brightness shin'd, The Soldier, Statesman, Patriot, Friend and King. All, all hast thou to celebrate and sing. His Olive and His Bays, Each Lineament and Feature of His Praise, Must thou in our fair Wreath of fadeless Glory bind, United must express in one compleat Design. III. Here should audacious Strains Attend His Courage to the martial Plains. There His wise Patience asks a Song Flowing less boiling, not less strong. Deep, as Counsels deep, should be thy Sense, And high, as His brave Spirit, thy Magnificence. For ev'ry Scene, must thou its Passion keep; Must joy, must triumph, must complain, must weep; To ev'ry Part of the great Story, fit Artful Numbers, varied Wit, To form a strong, sublime, a tender moving Verse, Proportion'd to His Acts, and worthy of His Herse. IV. Seest thou where the great Monarch lies? No longer Great, no longer Wise, No more the Hope of Friends, no more the Dread of Enemies. No more aspiring Conqu'rors to controul, Of honest Leagues the great informing Soul; No more to weak Allies strong Aid t' afford, No more to wield the Sceptre, or the Sword. No more—for He, the hated, and the lov'd, In whom the Counsels of the Age, in whom the Actions mov'd; Who watchful, ev'n against remoter Harms, Gave the blind sluggish Nations just Alarms, And fir'd their Hearts, and led their Arms; He too at last, of this sure Help bereft, To its wild self a giddy World hath left; He too depriv'd of His important Breath Unactive lies in the dull Arms of Death; Like meaner Kings, like common Mortals is become, An useless Weight of Earth, the Cumber of a Tomb. V. Should'st thou not make fair Liberty to mourn, And lovely Truth, and generous Piety, And Justice which His Ballance wish'd to see, And Honour proud of His rich Gallantry, With sinking Arms, and bending Head, Grieving their great Protector from them torn, Their great Example from them fled? Thou should'st.—With anxious Hearts and Eyes, Make all the Good, the Brave, the Wise, Lament so hasty, and ill-tim'd a Fate, All who themselves concenter with the State, And by its Greatness only would be Great; All who lov'd, and all who knew, What He had done, and what contriv'd to do. VI. Thus when the noble Poet, (for we dare With Heroes those who Heroes sing compare) Whether He forms a glorious Epick Scheme, Or does a lofty Drama frame, (Some great Event of Either the brave Theme, Some great Event and worthy of his Flame) His mighty Action far pursues Through various Chances and a Maze of Fate, Hazards of War and Plots of State, And still the destin'd End he views, And never does his Hero lose; Constant and bright his Character maintains, And animates throughout th' exalted Strains; Fashions all just, and executes it strong; ('Tis great, 'tis Inspiration all along) Conducting thus the wondrous Tale, Till now at the last Labour he arrives, Where good poetick Providence contrives, Honour, and Right, and Virtue should prevail. But ah! no longer then survives; Yet dying leaves perhaps behind Some Strokes of what his thoughtful Mind Had for the great Catastrophe design'd. Him all lament who the fair Work peruse, His Subject lov'd, and knew to prize his Muse; Repine at Fate, which would not give him leave To finish what he only cou'd conceive; Doubting if other Hands, with equal Skill, And equal Spirit, can the Rest fulfil. VII. But make Ambition gay, new Schemes contrive, And superstitious languid Hopes revive. Make Rome exult, and Gaul rejoyce, And their fond British Agents join their Voice: Here pious Men by loyal Frenzy won To wish their Country with themselves undone. The Creatures there, the Worshippers, the Stains Of haughty, loose, ignoble Reigns, Obsequious, prompt, to arbitrary Sway, Who all but Laws and Order can obey; Some too, perhaps, to join Extreams, Who lose their Wits in Democratick Dreams. Let fickle Folly smile it knows not why, And Eyes of dull Ingratitude be dry. Let such against His Memory declaim, Who dare prophane Eliza's Name; Who sure at gen'rous Counsels to repine, Still measure all by their short crooked Line, And Kings and God would to their Paths confine; Who meaning ever their own partial Ends, So faithfully mistake their Foes and Friends; The furious Nimrods of the Clergy Race, Who hunt before the Lord a zealous Chace; Their Hate does Worth presume, their Praise is full Disgrace. VIII. Time was, when to a kinder Use design'd, The Temple bright with all its Glory shin'd; Then, when th' anointing Oil was shed To consecrate the Monarch's Head, And fair Maria by His Side, (Where now in Death's unlovely Guise A Consort but of Dust She lies) In Robes of Majesty, afresh ally'd, Was of His Empire too the Bride. O Poet, what fit Strains wilt thou imploy, What Force of Figures to express, Not the rich Pomp or Royal Dress, (That's ev'ry Coronation's Toy) But their own Lustre, and the brave Excess Of a transported Nation's real Joy? The Sky with Acclamations rent, Unequal yet to what they meant? The Hearts that spoke at dancing Eyes Both above Language and Disguise? Such Golden all without Allay, Was the Delight of their own former Day, When Love auspicious join'd th' illustrious Pair (All Britain gave their Princess there) While then by Hope the King and Queen Were in the Husband and the Wife foreseen. Such (not so general, but as just, And offer'd still ev'n to Her Dust) When to the Poorness, and the Pain Of a short, and rigid Reign, Eliza did succeed, the Realms to bless With Glory and with ev'ry Happiness. Such (though less solid and less wise) When, from blind Anarchy's tempestuous Night, Old Government restor'd to Light, Charles rose to meet His People's longing Eyes. That mighty Blaze did faintly last, Long before Noon the shady Morn o'ercast. Yet shall it ever be an honour'd Day, Which to Nassau's prepar'd the necessary Way. IX. Not from Obscurity, unprov'd, unknown, Did He ascend the Throne. The mighty Part on the World's noblest Stage, He long with so much Fame had play'd, Did every Confidence persuade; All from the Past the Future might presage. Well we presum'd that He Would easy hold the Reins of Monarchy, Who a Republick's Course so soft did guide, And over unhurt Freedom could preside; That He all-worthy was to reign, Who could unhandsome Sov'reignty disdain, Did every Hazard choose, Venture His Country, and Himself to lose, Rather than triumph o'er her Liberty, Or sink His own to mean Dependency. Too just, too prudent, and too brave, To be a Tyrant or to be a Slave. X. Nor was our decent Hope misplac'd; Nothing the Credit of that Joy disgrac'd. No dark Designs, no gradual Scenes appear'd, To make us anxious, or Him fear'd. Faction and Discontent were their own Shame; Whoever chang'd, yet He remain'd the same, Disappointing those alone Who need weak Kings or can agree with none. Commerce and War He reconcil'd, And Plenty in the midst of Taxes smil'd. Taxes and War, the real Crimes Of others Conduct, and preceding Times. Not the Physician is to blame That, a long growing Malady to tame, He freely must the Patient bleed, Or the hard Cure does Time and Sufferance need: Nor, if the Bill does high amount, Should it be plac'd to his Account, (Of whom we ask but Skill and Care To manage to the best the bad Affair) But all is to be reckon'd to the Score Of old Mismanagements before; The wanton Luxury, th'unwholesom Ease, And fond Neglect that fed so high the strong Disease. XI. Where am I led? How do I stray? I only meant to shew thy Muse her Way; To start some Hints she should pursue, And those of very many very few. Would'st Thou know all that He hath done, From His first Arms, and Bodgrave's noble stand; What He hath sav'd, what He hath won, His Vigilance of Head, and Promptitude of Hand; Go, search the Annals; there for half an Age His Name shall brighten ev'ry Page; Go, ask of Fame (she need not stretch her Size) Go, ask His very Enemies. Ask them, why thrice ten Years are past, Yet their devoted Ilium still does last? Why Holland rais'd, and free, and great again Is now to France what once she was to Spain? How to Versailles, Whitehall was lost, And British Gales the Gallick Course have cross'd? Why all the Nations round are not become The double Slaves of Louis and of Rome? XII. Then ask again why He who this could do, Should not go farther too? Why yet the World is not a Rest, But still 'tis Hazard, and 'tis still Contest? Why League on League, of formidable Show, So high should promise, and perform so low? Ask, for they know all the corrupted Parts, The squinting Views, and their own crooked Arts; Their Friendly Foes that did themselves betray, And the false Fires that led them from their Way; What Fruit they gather'd from the Golden Show'r, And from the Heats of Bigottry what more; How th' open Face could yield to the Disguise, How easy 'tis to fool, how hard to keep Men wise. Then shalt thou find, reflecting on the Game, How His the Glory was, the World's the Shame. 'Tis thus in Schemes of nice Theology, (If wanton Poetry so high May let a bold Allusion fly) Thus between Grace and Liberty. Still the good Spirit is at Hand, But too too oft his Motions we withstand, Which, as we follow or resist, (To let some faulty Lust prevail, Or listen to th' old Serpent's Tale) Much Good is done, but more is mist, While thus the various Mixture fairly shewn, The Good is chiefly Heav'ns, the Bad is all our own. XIII. Let no Provokings, no Discouragement His saving Influence e'er prevent. Still make Him here assist, and there restrain: Not a Year, a Day in vain Let Him incline or bear to reign: Attentive to His Work of Liberty, (Not minding Weakness, nor regarding Pain) For it He liv'd, and make Him in it dy. Not as that Emp'ror who with sportive Breath, Descending from his Dignity in Death, The mortal Exit ready to be made, Ask'd if the Farce of Life he handsomely had play'd; But firm like Him, who worthy to the last, Of Rule He had so well sustain'd, (E'er to untry'd new Hands it past,) Mov'd those around Him to advance and hast, If to be done by Him yet any Thing remain'd. Thus let Him close the Volume of His Fame, And fix the Title of an endless Name. When at the Future best we guess, That which hath been, and that which we possess Alone is safe; so fickle and so strange Of Man and Fortune is the Change, That 'tis with Glory, as with Happiness. Life must be finish'd, and the Reign compleat, When Men we prosp'rous call, or call the Monarch Great. XIV. Now go, and take these Notices along, Go and prepare th' immortal Song. When Art shall labour for His sake to give To breathe the Marble, and the Brass to live, And grateful Times His Statues shall behold As those of Heroes, and of Gods of Old; When His Atchievements from expressive Looms In Courts shall grace instructive Rooms, And fire young future Princes as they view, First the great Things to know, and then pursue; When some Le Brun his Battles shall design, And choose the Alexander of the Boyne; When Hist'ry, nobler yet, shall draw Him whole, His Acts, His Aims, His inmost Soul, And Burnet on the smooth and solid Way, Down to all Ages shall His Worth convey; When with delightful learned Eloquence, Freedom of Truth, and Gravity of Sense, Sommers for Him shall think of doing more Than for Eliza, He wrote a Character of Queen Elizabeth. Bacon's self before. Not this, all this shall satisfy The Passion of concern'd Posterity. The tuneful Tribe with jealous Fire, To sound His Praise shall still require Their Mantuan Trumpet, their Venusian Lyre; Ask what Poetick Honours have been done His Name, Fond of each gen'rous Muse that lov'd to sing His Fame. Upon the Successes of the War. In January 1706–7. Years have their Glory, Ages have their Fame, (As their fair Suns shone with a brighter Flame) By great Events, wise Counsels, Deeds sublime, Rais'd and distinguish'd from the Rest of Time: As when Preeminence of like Renown Exalts the Place, and dignifies the Town, Where noble Victories have been obtain'd, An Empire rescu'd, or a Brabant gain'd. Whilst ev'ry Ocean views on ev'ry Coast Of Capes, of Bays, of Ports a mingl'd Host, How few may yet, indulg'd by Destiny, An Actium, a La Hogue, a Vigo be? Where are the Streams that can with Lustre shine Like thine, old Granicus, or Boyne, like thine? When Henry, or when Edward did Command, And English Laurels plant in Gallick Land, Not each rich Summer did a Harvest yield, Like that of Agincourt's or Cressy's Field. All Times do not great Charters for us gain, Not ev'ry Age boasts an Eliza's Reign; When through th' Extent of more than forty Years, (Years more than Forty were too few of Hers) A Queen could keep (nor by fallacious Arts) The very Mistress of a Nation's Hearts; Yet farther ev'n than Love Esteem could raise, And draw and force from very Hatred Praise: When check'd Oppression, shelter'd Liberty, Shew'd what Her just and equal Rule must be, Who durst the injur'd Subjects Cause maintain; Durst for a near Republick Safety gain: When Foes well chosen and a well urg'd War Brought Honour home, and carried Terror far; Made England sov'reignly appear in State, Courted and fear'd, Happy, and Wise, and Great; Alarm'd but once, and with a lucky Fright, It trembled but more high to shoot its Light. Where are the Days which to such Lustre dare Their Shadows to prefer or to compare? What disproportion'd and degenerate Times (Of equal Follies and of equal Crimes) Succeed, alike unmeriting the Lot To be remembred, or to be forgot? Sometimes 'tis Peace; but the Peace does not bless; A Poisoner with the Food of Happiness. A dull dead Calm (a dull dead Calm at best) That keeps us bound in poor ignoble Rest, When we the Voyage should of Glory make, Should in the Bus'ness of the World partake, And aid a Game where we must have a Stake. A Sleep unquiet, whose hard breathings tell, All is not free within, all is not well. False as the Health that's breeding a Disease, And rather Florid looks, than feels at Ease. There may be Plenty, there may be Excess, And Elegance, and State, and Wantonness. All does but Damocles his Feast afford, When we look up and view th' impending Sword. Now the sharp Sword, more than impending found, Falls on the Head and does the Body wound. Intestine Wars let loose at large to Rage Devour the Kingdoms and deform the Age. Prince, Nobles, State, all in one Ruinly; The People reign, yet 'tis not Liberty; And their mad Architects, but half way skill'd, Pull down old Fabricks, and no new ones build. Strange Scenes of Government then shift so fast, As each came only to shove off the last; While the tir'd Realms as little understand Whom to obey, as why they should command. The great State Ship, on the wild Billows tost, By ev'ry Wind is driv'n on ev'ry Coast. If here or there at Anchor it abides, 'Tis but a while, and rolling as it rides. Here, thoughtless Laughter grown th' affected Guise, Wit the dull Folly scorns of being wise. Pleasures o'erflow, our Manners to defile, And foreign Modes effeminate the Isle. The Tricks of Cybeleian Gauls Certain emasculated Fellows, who used to dance in a fantastick Habit, and a fantastick Manner. we play, And toss and dance, as giddy and as gay, Take the Fool's Coat, and toss the Man away. And there so heartlessly to War we go, The Foe is wish'd the Friend, the Friend the Foe. Thus with a sullen or a foolish Face, In plenty of diversify'd Disgrace, How might almost a Century intervene Ere a brave William did restore the Scene! On its old Base He set our Empire right, And taught us where to war, and how to fight; Made, with resembling Zeal, his France her Spain, Re-seiz'd the floating Trident of the Main; Retriev'd our Fame, our Interest did increase, Watchful in Arms, nor slumb'ring ev'n in Peace. And if, when the last Act was just in View, Fate the great Actor from the Stage withdrew, If for His Follower He with all His Pain Cou'd not the Sweets of gentle Ease obtain, A settled Europe, and a peaceful Reign; Yet left He nobly to pursuing Care, A well form'd League for an auspicious War; To ANNA a great Opportunity, A new Eliza, or yet more to be, And to Her Churchill, in his martial Sphere, To be a Maurice, and to be a Vere; Left greater Strength a greater Foe to foil, And left the Glory where He left the Toil. What now has ANNA, what Her Churchill done? How have the Years, and how our Fortunes run? Witness you Lines, which such an useless Mound Against th' Irruption of His Arms were found. Witness you Ships, whom nor your selves, nor Booms, Nor Forts cou'd keep from your allotted Dooms; From Floods, and Flames, and greedy hostile Pow'rs, From being nothing, or from being ours. Why shou'd I follow our advent'rous Bands To Tajo's Streams, or to Valentian Lands? Why shou'd I Gibraltar Exploits atttend, When first we won it, or did next defend? Or why collect the Mites of Marlb'rough's Praise, His Preludes on the Rhine, or on the Maese? As the just Nile its Summers never fails, But o'er the Plains with spreading Arms prevails; No Diff'rence found but in Degrees of Good, Or from a more or less victorious Flood; While still on him th' Egyptian World relies, And loves to see him full and bravelier rise; When, with a Marlb'rough's happier Careers, He goes beyond the Wants of single Years: Such do our needful Armies annual Show, Of our Success such is the faithful Flow. The Queen Her Part, the Gen'ral his sustains; He rolls the Current, and She finds the Alluding to the Cause of the Nile's Increase, allow'd to be the Ethiopick Summer Rains. Rains. Not yet at each Return the kindly War Swells alike high, or stretches alike far; Nor equal Trophies does luxurious raise, Or for a Nation's Thanks, or Poet's Praise: Senates might triumph, Temples might rejoice; The quiet Muses mingled not their Voice, Nor would exult for ev'ry Province won, Or sing a Liege, a Limburg, or a Bon: But waited for a yet more bright Campaign To light their Fires; nor did they wait in vain. When Conquest almost threaten'd to stand still, Or keep no Pace our Journey to fulfil; When Flandrian Plains no Prospect would afford Of lusty Work for a decisive Sword; (While Gallick Caution plaid its usual Game, And others Coolness temper'd Churchill's Flame) Then He (who did the sluggish Growth abhor) Agreed advent'rous to transplant the War, Where it might try a loftier Shoot to rear; Where having less to fear it more might dare; Where Threat'nings high, and Emperors distress'd, Requir'd Controll, and hard for Succour press'd. For Austria now, awak'd to be afraid, Had felt an Ax that to the Root was laid; Their Eagle fear'd to be itself a Prey, And Germany did Germany betray. The light Bavarian, changing Friends and Foes, Their Downfall sought by whom so high he rose; Their Power for which he conquer'd wou'd subdue, And cast, by Bourbon Schemes, his Aims anew, Obsequious to embrace the Servant's Sin Who fires the House to let the Robbers in. The bleeding Empire piercing Hurts receives, And is the Jew among the Gospel Thieves. Those who by nearest Obligations ow'd A kind Relief, no kind Relief bestow'd: The Priest and Levite pass'd neglectful by, And cast from t'other Side a heartless Eye: But then a good Samaritan was found T' assist the Helpless, and to heal the Wound. England no Diff'rence wou'd, nor Distance see; To want her Care her Neighbour was to be. From the low Rhine, up to the Danube's Bed, His ready Aids rejoycing Marlb'rough led. Fond of the Change, and with Presages gay, The Britons love, and urge their German Way; (Those Lions in her Forests hope for Prey.) Before them loud did Fame her Trumpet sound; But, when arriv'd, their own were louder found; While they made good, while they surpass'd whate'er Their Friends could hope, or Enemies could fear. The Chief soon saw with what they must contend, Works ready their Defenders to defend, Nature by Art, and Force by Care supply'd, He saw it all, and did it all deride: Nor would defer the Work he came to do; Toil was too much without some Danger too. The Macedonian Brave as far might go To seek an Empire he would overthrow: That March must still less Wonder in it have; Our Wills are keener to destroy than save. Cilicia's Straits he did unguarded find, And his kind Foes their Schellenberg resign'd, Churchill's were kinder yet, when they did chuse To keep a Pass they were constrain'd to lose. Deluding Ramparts, impotent and vain, That promis'd British Fury to restrain! Your Deaths contemn'd, your Difficulties brav'd, Whate'er you menac'd, yet you nothing sav'd; Not those, who trusted you, from helpless Flight, And wanting Shelter from the friendlier Night; Not from the Victor's Feet or Spoiler's Hand, The Danube's Streams, or the Bavarian Land; Nor its proud Lord from his perplex'd Retreat To Augsburg's Walls, and to his own Deceit. Count not the Loss with which we bought the Gain; 'Twas paid in Foes through such brave Hazards slain, 'Twas paid in Fame; and, if ought yet remains, It shall be treble paid at Hochstet's Plains; Where from our Fire Troops shall to Rivers fly, Captiv'd by thousands, shall by thousands die; Convinc'd afresh what British Spirits dare, From past Experience sooner shall despair; While conscious we disdain a Prize to yield That's greater, in a less unequal Field. There, Churchill, how did bright thy Fortune shine! While happy Alexander's Part was thine! So in Arbella's celebrated Day, (Nor to Arbella's Bleinheim's shall give way) So he (where he his Lot of Battle chose) Repell'd, o'erturn'd, dispers'd his Share of Foes: While by Mazæus still Parmenio press'd Upheld a Combat, doubtful at the best; 'Till his fierce Foes, struck with the wounding Fame Of their Friends Fate, desponding grew more tame; O'er the whole Field the Vict'ry then compleat, Those could pursue who almost did retreat. What more could either's Genius for you do? You vanquish'd for your selves, and others too. When Gideon had prepar'd his fuller Host, 'Twas order'd Numbers should not have the Boast. T'enlarge his Hopes he did contract their Sum, Taught that they were too many to o'ercome. Superfluous Cohorts thus away were sent Which else had serv'd our Conquest to prevent. 'Twas our Decrease the tempted Foe decoy'd, First to be safe, and then to be destroy'd. Now laugh, Bavaria, that less closely press'd, Thy Arts procur'd thee Time, Supplies and Rest. Ours was the Gain and Luck of the Delay; Unjoin'd thou couldst have been but half a Prey. Thy Boians sighing leave their native Soil, And sullen Gauls forsake their foreign Spoil. See how away their shrinking Legions haste! Howe'er they sudden flow'd, they ebb more fast. So did of old deliver'd Egypt find The Locusts hurry from the driving Wind. Fair Year, how lovely to the Memory's Sight, Must thy brave Days to us shine ever bright! How in thy Honours shalt thou still remain, And Gifts, too good to have 'em giv'n in vain! From thee free Cities all again are free, And Austria gains yet more than Liberty; Landau once more to Germany's restor'd, Traerbach no longer owns a Gallick Lord, Europe sees chang'd the Face of her ill Game, And British Arms date a new gawdier Fame. Yet soon, Fair Year, another shall be born Whose Fortunes shall ev'n thy Successes scorn; When hapless France shall meet with no Repair For Losings here, by healing Winnings there; But from the Roots each failing Project torn, We more shall joy, and Louis more shall mourn; When Eugene shall, like Churchill, have his Hour, And each be by himself a Conqueror, With Fate like theirs, who, after social Trade, And, with joint Stock, a thriving Venture made, Part too so well, that each advances more Singly, than both together did before. As when th' aspiring Poet, forc'd a while By inobsequious Matter drops his Stile, After some beautiful, and bolder Flight, Not low he falls descending from his Height; And soon as fair Occasion to his View Offers itself to be improv'd anew, Again he stretches, and again does soar, And joys, and emulates himself before: Such was our War (nor fail'd good Strokes to bring) From Bleinheim's Summer to Ramillia's Spring; Such was our War, when fair Ramillia's Spring Did, with Increase, a Bleinheim's Summer bring. See, see the Gauls embattel'd on the Plain To try new Hopes, which they shall try in vain. Yet there's Revenge their Valour to inflame, And former Honour too, and latter Shame. But the weak Passion still shall stronger prove, And shew that 'tis in War as 'tis in Love; Where a poor Nymph (who too had vanquish'd been When least, perhaps, she had the Fate foreseen) Blushing and blaming her too easie Crime, Thinks better to resist another Time; And well perhaps she fences, and perhaps The Lover falls, and just, and just she scapes; But he returns, and her Alarms begin, And soon she finds that she again must sin; The sense of former things does quick revive, Nor longer then she has the Heart to strive; Yielding to all th' Impressions of his Flame, She gives Way faster, and confirms her Shame. Like Turn and End our ruder Struggle found: Here lies the Gen'ral prostrate on the Ground; There Foes presumptuous grow secure of all; Soon undeceiv'd; he rises, and they fall. Entellus so, rais'd from the harmless Plain, (As Fate had meant his Hindrance for his Gain) Urg'd with thick Strokes the Phrygian o'er the Field, And made him feel his Refuge was to yield. Strongly the watchful Guardian overthrown, Th' Hesperian Garden open is our own; To take its precious Fruit, but not to claim; Our Labours too intend a nobler Aim; Euristheus has the Prize, and Hercules the Fame. Fair Cities (those our tempting Apples are; More truly Golden, and more lovely far) Or kindly drop into the Gatherer's Hand, Or would in vain a handsome Force withstand. 'Twere weary Work to follow swift Renown To ev'ry Fortress, and to ev'ry Town, That prov'd our Arms, or trusted to our Faith, From early Lovain, to concluding Aeth. Not, Menin, thy own Strength a Guard could be, Nor, Dendermond, thy drown'd Campaign to thee. Where now, Ostend, 's thy Fame of Days before, When only Ilium had, in Fable, more? Three real Years pass'd, ere thou wouldst be won: Coy then so long, now art thou kind so soon? Let one good Reason for both Times prevail; Those then defended thee, who now assail. Who dares be sure that this is all? who knows What to the British Arms th' Italian owes? His wondrous March when bold Eugenio made, And flew o'er Rivers, Trenches to invade; When Turin's Schellenberg at once did do A Bleinheim's Work, and a Ramillia's too, A Piemont sav'd, and did a Milan gain, Might he not then against a Rival strain? By his own Brav'ry warm'd enough before, A view of Glory still might fire him more. His Vict'ries thus by Churchill's might be won, And his Troops dare what had by ours been done. Take this away, yet England still was there; Her Golden Aids supply'd a solid Share. Whoe'er compos'd the Limbs, or rul'd the Pow'rs, The needful Sinews of the War were ours. Who can those Sinews touch, and dully prove Unmindful of the Head by which they move? Who would not just salute Godolphin's Fame? Short Praise will serve where none presumes to blame. His Providence at Home is felt afar: To guide the Treasure is to rule the War. His Key divides with the good Gen'ral's Sword; But his Campaigns no Winter's Ease afford. How can the faithful Halifax's Care Here be refus'd a well-demanded Share? A Debt of Honour lastingly is his, Due for both what he was. and what he is. Shall the Year pass, Mordaunt, without thy Name? Activity was half of Cæsar's Fame. Prompt to relieve what thou wert brave to gain, Thy Barcelona doubly prov'd thy Vein. Let heavy Captains boast the practis'd Part; Thy native Vigour foil'd the Fencer's Art. Why, finish'd Galway, should we thee decline? Tho' Sysiphus's wretched Part were thine. What if th' unwilling Weight falls back again? There may be Praise in Lab'ring ev'n in vain. But luckless Merit shines but to a few; It is not what we are, but what we do. Soldier, thou know'st a Philosophick Part; Let thy good Head teach Patience to thy Heart. Of that poor Virtue Marlb'rough has no need; His rich Attempts beyond our Hopes succeed. The waving Sword in his auspicious Hand, Carries th' Effect of a Magician's Wand; Makes vanquish'd Legions like aw'd Spirits do, Not retreat only, but ev'n vanish too. When by the Mother, and the Daughter Queen, Their, and their Persia's, Conqu'ror first was seen, His graceful Friend they for himself mistook, Nor found the Hero in th' unanswering Look. Churchill had there been safe; he both can be Th' Hephæstion, and the Alexander he. Happy Commander, like him so the more For having had thy Philip too before, Who left thee Troops so worthy to subdue, Thy Veteran Troops, and thy Parmenio's too. But then unjust, like him, thou wilt not be, (Not such thy Envy, or thy Vanity) Nor grudge to each, what does to each belong; To do them Right, is not to do thee Wrong. Happy Commander, whose kind Enemies For thee, less wary, seem no longer wise. Who durst have hop'd, who modern Fields had known, That France would open Play have needless shown; With mod'rate Odds Foes unbetray'd would meet, And venture on the Chance of a Defeat? Not thus when William the hard War did guide; Then surer strength and steadier Arts they try'd. While he had leave with a Le plus grand homme de ce tems là, mais le plus malheureux, says the Bishop of Rhodes of him. Coligny's Fate Not to be fortunate, but only Great; Often Successless, awful still appear'd, And conquer'd less, because he was so fear'd. He, who his Army made as well as led, At once their warming Heart and forming Head; He who would not let Battle of Seneff. Conde win the Day; But from that Lion ravish'd back the Prey; He, who, when Battle of Mount Cassel. vanquish'd, would not vanquish'd be, But made Retreat, to him, be Victory; So dear could sell a Conqu'ror's empty Name, That the Battle of Landen. lame Honour was not worth the Maim; Was not to be allow'd an equal Lay, At once for winning Glory and the Day. So 'gainst a Nymph of known and dang'rous Fame, We guard so well we scape her conqu'ring Aim, While rashly vent'ring on th' unpractis'd Maid, Oft we pay dear for being less afraid. Happy Commander, happy in regard Both of thy Work, and of thy Work's Reward. Titles, and Wealth, and Favour, all are thine; New Limitations dignify thy Line; Thy Daughters Sons are made, and all agree At once in Honour of the Fair and thee. Bleinheim with Vict'ry in its Name does rise A massie lasting Trophy to the Skies. The Poets fain Eternity would give; Nor shalt thou die if they themselves can live. The People give Applause; only the Queen Is louder bless'd, or with more Rapture seen. The Queen who sits, like a first Cause, above, While by Her Laws below the second move; So in Her Palace keeps the Sov'reign Mind, Sending the Spirits to their Parts assign'd; Obsequious to their Provinces they run, And do but what she order'd to be done. If we are prosp'rous, if we pow'rful shew, To Her 'tis owing first who wills it should be so. Hers is with just Prerogative the Praise Of all their Worth, whom She, with more, does raise; The Praise of those who Kingdoms can unite, Who wisely counsel, or who bravely fight; Of those who Justice on the Bench decree, Of Holt's sound Law, and Cowper's Equity; Of all who toil our Safety to increase, By foreign Conquests, or domestick Peace. Nor does She find Her Benefits are vain, Nor o'er a thankless Race does unrequited reign. Her Senate gen'rously assists Her Fame, Her Realms a thousand Gratulations frame, And shew such Zeal for Her and Her Success, That She Her self loves Her own Glory less. All in their sev'ral Ways their Homage pay, And wish no more than ever so t'obey. Who would not let 'em ever so obey, Rejoyc'd to see 'em such glad Homage pay? What may their Country not expect again, From Churchill's Service, and from Anna's Reign, When whate'er that, or this, can do of Good, Is all so willingly well understood, So gratefully return'd, as we design'd A Charm that should our Benefactors bind; When noble Deeds, and Fame acquir'd before, Are with the Noble too but Earnests still of more? Janus, thou future Time dost present see, Know'st how Events will with our Hopes agree, And what thy untry'd Year intends to be; If 'twill for Sieges chuse to be renown'd, Or in the Field with fairer Laurels crown'd; If, in proceeding Belgium to restore To be the Belgium once it was before, It means Namure again shall have a Name; (Nor only under William give us Fame) Or, if our older Honours to renew, In France itself it English Arms may view. Some gen'rous-Fruit it must design to bear, Nor amid such Renown will lose its Share. As thou foreseest, Bards sometimes can foretell, And, when the Prospect's pleasing, love it well. Let others love it, but already I Have had enough of dreaming Prophecy. No more indulging visionary Rage, We yet may wish, and may the Wish presage. May'st thou, young Year, then happily aspire, And stately build our British Glory higher. May Churchill his own conqu'ring Steps pursue, And others emulous pursue 'em too. May Louis rash, as a vex'd Gamester, grow, And, to lose deep, set boldly to the Throw. May thus our Fleet too its Ramillia gain, And Shovel prove the Marlb'rough of the Main. May our Iberian War grow strong, and thrive, And prosp'rously with ev'ry Hardship strive. May ANNA, efficacious in Intrigue, Preserve in Heart an unmolested League; Some Quiet make, and others Quiet keep, Make the Rhine wake, and make the Danube sleep. And if soft Peace thou with thy downy Wing May'st hatch, and such a lovely Present bring, May it be Peace; for all must less abhor War that breeds Peace, than Peace that leads to War. At Home may the same wise and good Design Two Kingdoms and two Kingdoms Wishes join. Let not the Marriage, like a Marriage, do, And make us one the more to make us two; But calm let either British Nation learn What is their mutual and their great Concern; By Reason taught (which may their Pride controll) How here to be a Part's more than to be a Whole. May fair Religion love a moral Fame, And pity'd Whimseys make its only Shame; May ev'ry Faith some Charity reveal, And teach Humanity, as well as Zeal. Thus may'st Thou bravely with past Years contend, Nor only like Thy Predecessor end, But so, a thousand Ways illustrious, shine, That only following Times may vie with Thine. Upon His Majesty's Accession and Arrival. In the Year 1714. He comes, of waiting Nations the Desire, Comes to fulfill our Hopes, and Songs inspire; Comes the brave William's Image to express, Make us review Him more, and want Him less. Years we had late of Glory and of Arms; But Conquest cloy'd, and Peace had painted Charms. As we had play'd with War for Playing's Sake, We won the Game, and we return'd the Stake. Like her of old (who plotted to evade The Hopes she gave, the Promises she made, Lovers elude who never touch'd her Breast, And wait the Lord who all her Wish possest) By Counsels dark to spoil good Work we strove, Our Night unrav'lling what our Day had wove. He comes the Madness, and the Wast to stay, All to preserve that is not thrown away, Of Enemies to mock the vain Pretence, And justify the Care of Providence. The Man, whom God did to the Seer design (Not with Regard to Eldership and Line) The future Ruler of his chosen Race, When his Day came, and better Fate took Place, (Sudden, surprizing, certain, after Years Of evil Aspect, and of cloudy Fears) Possess'd at first not half the destin'd Throne; Judah was his, but Judah was alone. His Israel whole at once this David gains; No Abner here the House of Saul maintains; All bow; the very Tribe of Benjamin Homage profess, and fain would Favour win. When Conclaves thus the Triple Crown have plac'd, Submiss alike the different Factions hast; And ev'n those fly the Pontiff to adore Who gave his Rival all their Aid before. The March proceeds; the various Train survey, The Pomp, the Glories that adorn His Way. Hear what a Voice the Joy to Heav'n does send, The Myriads see which His Approach attend, With willing Worship in His Day of Power, And Eyes that ev'n his distant Looks devour. This Son to our blest Sion's Empire born, As from the Womb of the delightful Morn The silver Dew, such to salute His Sight The Conflux shews, as plenteous and as bright. Life in the Cheeks, and Pleasure in the Air, Age feels new Youth, and Beauty looks more fair. But see, oh! see how prideless, how sedate He views the Honours, and sustains the State. Such Temper congruously by those is shewn Who mean to reign not for themselves alone, Freedom and Empire would together bring, And know that 'tis a Task to be a King. Thus while He moves on the triumphant Stage, What various Thoughts the busied Minds engage! Some the new Change with Eyes of Wonder see, And for a Moment doubt if yet 'tis He. Some curious to consult His Form and Face, His Virtues in His Visage think to trace, Find in His Look, as Fame hath drawn his Mind, The Plain, the Calm, the Steady, and the Kind. To future Times enlarging then their Scope Seek in His Heir Britannia's other Hope, With Audenard's Day, and great Remembrance fir'd Of Danger scorn'd and fadeless Bays acquir'd. The lovely Sex t' indulge their Eyes prepare (For still the Brave are precious to the Fair,) And guess what lively Beams, what vig'rous Rays, Must warrant such a Flame, and such a Praise. Others, old Splendor to the New to join, Backwards review the long illustrious Line; Now the remoter, now the nearer Parts, Ernestine Arms, polite Sophia's Arts. Not passing her, worthy a happier Scene Daughter of King James I. Bohemia's pitied and abandoned Queen, Whose Spirit shares fraternal Henry's Fire, And Fate reproach'd an unresenting Sire; Then George, the sixth of seven Brothers, who agreeing that only one should marry, and the Person to be determin'd by casting Lots, the Lot fell upon Him, from whom issued Christian Lewis the late Duke of Zell, and Ernest the King's Father. Him whom Chance so fitly did ordain Down to transmit the rich exalted Strain, Worth to infuse into heroick Zell, And give the noble Christian to excell, The Predecessor of his Grandson's Name, And equal Predecessor of His Fame, For Prudence so, and so for Truth renown'd, And Courage with a Cause of Honour crown'd; Ernest, Grandfather of George. He introduced the Reformation, and defeated the Anabaptists.Him too, who off the Roman Bondage threw, And did Fanatick Libertines subdue. Thence wandring upwards in a Field of Pow'rs, Conquerors, Heroes, Rulers, Emperors, If not to Guelph's, and Azou's early Time, They to the Height of mighty Otho, Son of Henry, was Emperor, and Frederick was chose in the Room of Wenceslaus deposed. Henry climb. Henry the He was surnamed the Lion. See for all these things Schowart's Observations Historical and Geanealogical. Lion of th' Hercinian Shade, Bavaria Him, Him Saxony obey'd; His was from Elve's to the Rhine's wealthy Streams The wide Dominion; now Britannick Thames Joys to repay His potent Offspring more Than from the Rhine to Elve He lost before. Him as Fate's distant Secrets He had read, Our Henry II. in whom the Saxon Line was restored. Henry chose for His Matilda's Bed; While younger Daughters meant for meaner things, Possess'd Castilian and Sicilian Kings. Remembring this, it does new Joy afford, Doubly to see our Saxon Line restor'd. Mix'd as we are by Conquest, Time and Art, Our German Ground is still our nobler Part, Sways in our Manners, in our Race abounds, Rules in our Laws, and in our Language sounds; And if to keep a State more near the same, We oft should bend it tow'rds the prim'tive Frame, Kind Fate perhaps in fresh Teutonic Kings To right our Motions hath renew'd the Springs. Leaving this range, and each Ancestral Urn, They from His Lineage to Himself return; Think of bright Paths He still hath lov'd to tread, Arms He hath born, and Armies He hath led; Of being courted to accept Command, And that Command experienc'd and disdain'd; Of Faith to Liberty's fair Interest, And hatching Mischief in the Opprest; Of Years mature, and Government long prov'd, And ancient Subjects, loving and belov'd, And Bounds of Laws made easy by a Mind, Which in unstinted Pow'r itself confin'd. To crown the rest, grateful and pleas'd they note Who, watching Times, did the good Work promote; From what First Mover both Effects did spring; To whom we owe th' Elector and the King. From all inclining to a kind Presage Of prosp'rous Glory for the coming Age, If pois'ned Humours, and a frantick Land Admit the Methods of the saving Hand. In Him the Swain an honest Hope resumes, To sheer his English Fleece for English Looms. Commerce in Him, His Counsels, and His Aid Trusts to revive, sure not to be betray'd. The Church depends on Him to be ensur'd, Both from Her Foes, and from Herself secur'd. The State hopes all that Vigour can impart, With foreign Wisdom, and a British Heart. Oh! could that Wisdom so prevailing be With British Views to make His Britons see; Aright their Enmities and Fears direct, Nor gulphy Seas as verdant Plains affect; Cease the wild Roarings of light-headed Zeal, And let our foolish Wounds have Leave to heal; Then Praise renew'd our Union should attend, Nor Foes on Us more than themselves depend; Repair'd, erect and safe should stand our Frame, Or fall by outward Storms without our Shame; Then should He glory to have compass'd more Than mighty William could Himself before. Persuasive to Love. Love, Sylvia, love, if you'd be blest, Love is Life's great Interest. So valu'd, and so understood By all the Wise of Flesh and Blood. See, the Brute Shees all well-inclin'd, Are to the welcome Courtship kind. Each Bird selects a fav'rite Mate, And quits, well-pleas'd, her virgin State. Fishes, which seem so cold to be, Are warm to Love, ev'n in the Sea. Our Mother Earth betimes begun, And still enjoys the vig'rous Sun. The barren Soil, where all is vain, That neither teems with Grass, nor Grain, Yet loves the kind Endeavour still, And void of Pow'r, to shew the Will, More fierce the darted Beams devours, And greedier sucks the falling Show'rs. All Things to kindly Love are true, And Nature pay in that her due; Of hated Chastity afraid, And nothing willing is a Maid. And shall dull Woman court alone That which all other Creatures shun, Wilfully negligent, and coy To the World's universal Joy? Think, Sylvia, 'tis not in Retreat But Conversation Life is sweet. The freakish Anchoret rhat flies From this, meets Scorn from all the Wise. And can it then be thought well done From Nature's best Converse to run? Will it the Maid's Discretion prove To live the Anchoret of Love? No, not in all their Solitude Are wildest Beasts so dully rude. Still sociable to this Regard, They couple, though they do not herd. From Things less needful they remove, Fly Day and Light, but follow Love. And shall not we? We're just and kind To meaner Appetites; we mind Our Thirst and Hunger; Drink and Food Are duely, and by all pursu'd. So should Love with yet greater Strife; Pleasure's of more concern than Life. Love against Liberty. Corinna, were you not so fair, You freely might have Leave to err. Now mix'd with yours our Int'rest lies; We suffer if you are not wise; Thus are concern'd for our own Sakes, To rectify your dull Mistakes; Each idler Fancy to remove, And give you juster Thoughts of Love: Love, which to you hath been too kind, No better Recompence to find; Love too, that would be kinder still, Would you but let Him have his Will. Your Servants see, a num'rous Race, That at your Feet still court your Grace; These Love hath brought, and for your Sake; But you their truest Use mistake. Love design'd frank and generous Ends, Meant them not Slaves alone, but Friends. And would each willing Youth employ For you a Minister of Joy. Why should you then, yourself to cheat, The good Intent of Love defeat? Choose from the Croud, choose one at least, Who bless'd in you may make you blest In silent soft Delights, to none But kind united Lovers known. Advantage take of proffer'd Gain, Nor render Youth and Beauty vain. Vain Beauty, and vain Youth does prove, Lost both, when not of Use to Love. Object not you, nor urge to me, The fond Pretence of Liberty. 'Tis but a Cheat with all its Boast, Dear kept, and would be wisely lost. The Man of Wealth by his Estate Is bound to Cares which on it wait, From which the starving Beggar's free; Would therefore you that Beggar be? In Visits, Company, and Friends, There's a Confinement that attends A Vassalage to Forms and Rules; Should therefore we turn savage Fools, Renounce Converse, and, known of none, Wilfully resolve to live alone? Corinna, heed not Thoughts so vain; Love is far more than worth its Chain, And bought at any Price, is Gain. Try, and when with your Lover join'd, Close you're in circling Arms confin'd, You'll find that Yoak so sweetly rude, So soft those Chains of Flesh and Blood; You shall the grateful Bondage bless, Kiss the kind Fetters while they press, Wish you might ever so be bound, While there with Triumph 'twill be own'd How dull, how very dull they prove, Who, to save Liberty, lose Love. SONG. [Sappho, thus with pitying Blame] I Sappho, thus with pitying Blame Did a thoughtless Maid reprove; Why at Lovers all this Aim, Yet thy self so strange to Love? Vain of Slaves you ill may treat, You ne'er know their truer Charms, Losing idly at the Feet Things whose Use is in the Arms. II Trust me, Nymph, we wrong contrive For our selves in wild Disdain; Left no Bliss but to derive Pleasure from a Wretch's Pain. Fools, for Nature's juster Art, Has in Love the Joys conjoyn'd; Scorns a poor mistaken Part, To be pleas'd we must be kind. To Love. Love, thou chief Good of Humankind How Friendly is thy Influence! Thy Passion sweetest sooths the Mind, Thy Pleasures highest treat the Sense. And yet we wrong thee and thy Joy; We waste thy Day and lose thy Night; Vain Men deride thee as a Toy, Poor Women fly thee in a Fright. No matter Love; the gentle Prize, And such as know thee hold thee dear; They find thy pleasing Follies wise; Thy Loss is what alone they fear. Some ev'ry Day to thee converts, And nobly thou hast this to boast, No Youth thy Service e'er deserts, No Nymph once gain'd was ever lost. SONG. [What tho' you cannot move Her] I What tho' you cannot move Her With all your Art and Pressing? Vex not, fond silly Lover, Nor curse the vain Addressing. Why should you lament When she should repent? What Help if a Fool will deny thee? 'Tis all but a miss Of a Face and a Kiss, And there's a good Sex to supply thee. II Who knows, would you but leave her, What Change she may discover? Perhaps may grant the Favour Rather than lose the Lover. If nothing avail, Yet 'tis odds if she fail To give thee full Right to disdain her; When after thy Love And thy Worth could not move, A Fool that has neither shall gain her. III Make Love an easy Fashion, And thy Success thy Measure; Discarding still the Passion, That will not bring the Pleasure. Examine not why The Lady is shy, If Nature or Honour advise her, But, thy part fairly done, If she'll not be won, Take leave and look out for a wiser. On the Word Meet. Sweet to Lovers the Surprize, Sweet the Joy of meeting Eyes, When they meet in Looks that prove That the Souls too meet in Love. Sweet 'tis the willing Hand to meet, To press and kiss it sweeter yet, Sweeter still and high in Bliss, When meeting Lips each other kiss. But oh! the luscious Sweet alarms But to think of meeting Arms! Britain. Britain, on other Lands let Bacchus smile; Venus thy Friend more dignifies thy Isle. No Clime its Beauties may compare; Supreme thou triumph'st in thy Fair. Compleat in each engaging Part, Nor scorch'd the Brow, nor froze the Heart, Their nobler Luxury do thou improve, And place thy wise Excess in Love. Kindness to a common Woman excus'd, SONG. I You laugh to see me fond appear Of one not worth the part, A Wretch by Nature insincere, And amorous by Art. Wrong not a well-meant honest Flame To Lais undesign'd; 'Tis to her Sex, not Her, I am So ardent and so kind. II Where now's the mighty Diff'rence shown In what we diff'rent do? One feigns to all alike, and One To all alike is true. As both have Hundreds done before, Each other we caress; Impartial she no Man loves more, And I no Woman less. The Wish, or the Mistress. I If e'er Passion, in Hope of refining Delight, Shall engage me beyond the Amour of a Night, To seek dearer Arms and a faithfuller Kiss, May it be for such Charms, such a Mistress as this. May her Face and her Mind to allure me conspire, And what one begun may the other raise high'r; Relenting her Nature, and moving her Air With Eyes of Desire to keep Hearts from Despair. II May she neither be easy nor yet too severe, But with handsome Resistance her Yielding endear, By winning Delays pleasing Hope lead along, And her Honour grow weak as my Passion grows strong; Till soft to the Flame all the Rigour remove, And she melt in a Fusion of Pleasure and Love, To make me rejoyce that I once did complain, To requite for the Stay, and repay for the Pain. III When thus she is mine, may she be mine alone, And want in Return to have me all her own. Not vain of her Power, not quick to distrust, May her Prudence and Faith teach her Swain to be just. May all her Endearments discover her Heart, From the Smile when we meet to the Sigh when we part; While ravish'd I see in each Look of her Eye, She for me would live, and she with me could dye. IV May she know to suit Love in his every Way, To languish, to toy, to be eager, and gay. In the Hours of Delight may she nothing forbear That can Pleasure impart, or can Pleasure declare. Yet sometimes sweet Blushes should follow, to tell The Wanton asham'd of her loving so well; Till, warm'd by a Kiss, she in Whisper confess, She may love too well, but she would not love less. V In publick, may no loose Demeanour betray The Freedom she loves, and the Game she does play; Yet nothing constrain'd, least I learn to believe She has Cunning to feign, and a Will to deceive; But all her Behaviour let Decency guide, Enrich'd with such Worth, and good Humour beside, That the World may not see, or not censure her Flame, But so much find to praise, that they nothing dare blame. VI To enoble the rest may she Friendship adjoyn, And the Play of her Love have no under Design; Whilst easy and safe in the Down of her Breast My Secrets may sink, and my Cares may all rest. Thus may she be all a fond Heart can require, Have much to esteem, and yet more to desire: Then, blest in her Arms, perhaps I may find, That a Woman can give more than half Woman-kind. SONG. [Fair Cloe my Breast so alarms] Sett by Mr. Henry Purcell. I Fair Cloe my Breast so alarms From her Pow'r I no Refuge can find. If another I take in my Arms, Yet Cloe is then in my Mind; Unblest with the Joy still a Pleasure I want, Which none but my Cloe, my Cloe can grant. II Let Cloe but smile, I grow gay, And I feel my Heart spring with Delight, On Cloe I gaze all the Day, And Cloe do wish for each Night; Awake when I think, or asleep if I dream, Here Cloe's the Image, there Cloe the Theme. III Oh! did Cloe but know I love, And the Pleasure of Loving again, My Passion her Favour would move, And in Prudence she'd pity my Pain; Good Nature and Int'rest should both make her kind, For the Joy she might give, and the Joy she might find. SONG. [Can nothing, nothing move her] I Can nothing, nothing move her To save a hapless Swain? Nor Kindness for the Lover? Nor Pity of the Pain? See, how she flies denying To hear me but complain, Leaves me all faint and dying, Helpless, and vainly trying To bring her back again. II Let nothing, nothing move her To save a hapless Swain, Nor Kindness for the Lover, Nor Pity of the Pain. Yet seeking no Restoring, No Change his Faith shall stain; Nor will he cease adoring, Nor sighing, nor imploring, Tho' all shall be in vain. III But hopeless thus to languish When he no more shall bear, But, pin'd with ceaseless Anguish, Shall sink beneath his Care; Then she, that did bereave him Of Life, shall mourn his Fate; Then wish she could retrieve him, Then willing to relieve him, But then 'twill be too late. Love to no Purpose. I Cloe loving, who'd believe Her Swain could ask, and she not give! What, to love and to deny! To be inclin'd, and yet to fly! She might sigh, or I complain; But both to sigh, and both in vain. II See what idle Doubts can do, Poor Cloe would, and would not too. When the Bliss in View appears, Much, much she wishes, more she fears; Dreads to act the kinder Part, And has the Will, but wants the Heart. III Love 'tis thou that art to blame, That Woman giv'st so faint a Flame. Wishes thou shou'd'st give them too, Ardor those Wishes to pursue. Nymph, and Swain now both distrest, Find either love, and neither blest. Answer, in the Person of Love. I You say she loves, whom you adore; What would'st thou, foolish Swain, have more Think you that she, who dies to yield, Should e'er maintain the hated Field? 'Tis more than a weak Maid can do, Against herself and Lover too. II Go urge the trembling willing Dame; She cannot scape but with your Shame. Let but the Lover act his Part, The rest shall follow with the Heart. A while the Nymph may give thee Pain, But Two can ne'er love long in vain. Hylas and Doris. I Hylas sigh'd, and said complaining, Hope is fled, but Love's remaining; Love remains with ceaseless Anguish, But so flatt'ring is the Grief, That, tho' 'tis to Death I languish, I can wish for no Relief. II How, what Magick, Love, inventing Mak'st thou Ruine so contenting? Why deep Shades, and wild Retiring Court I thus to feed my Care? Here rejoice to lie expiring, Soothing thee against Despair? III Doris heard, and in Compassion Strove no more with Inclination. With a Smile his Hope reviving, With a Kiss she chear'd his Grief; He grew bold, and she, conniving, Let Him take a kind Relief. Iphis and Ianthe. Sett by Mr. Barret. I Ianthe the lovely, the Joy of her Swain; By Iphis was lov'd, and lov'd Iphis again; She liv'd in the Youth, and the Youth in the Fair, Their Pleasure was equal, and equal their Care; No Time, no Enjoyment the Dotage withdrew; But the longer they lov'd, still the fonder they grew. II A Passion so happy alarm'd all the Plain, Some envy'd the Nymph, but more envy'd the Swain. Some swore 'twou'd be pity their Loves to invade, That the Lovers alone for each other were made; But all, all consented that none ever knew A Nymph yet so kind, or a Shepherd so true. III Love saw them with Pleasure, and vow'd to take Care Of the faithful, the tender, the innocent Pair. What either did want, he bid either to move, But they wanted nothing but ever to love; Said 'twas all that to bless them his Godhead cou'd do If they still might be kind, and they still might be true. On a Riband of his, given to make a Girdle. So to some wealthy Friend we love, The honest Servant we remove; Advanc'd in whose far better Place, Th' indulgent Parting proves a Grace: Who will not swear 'twas to prefer, To give thee thus, and thus to her? Surround her Middle! I could find With me for thee, no Use so kind. The Zones above that gird the Sky, Are not exalted yet so high. Tho' they inclose each shining Star, Thou hold'st a better Heav'n there. O, O the Beauties! O the Love! The Joys, the Charms that in thee move? The Girdle Love's own Goddess wore, Scarce that could boast to compass more. Dear Riband, how I love thee now! And now, fond Nymph, she loves thee too; Pleas'd, pleas'd so well with no Embrace, But when these Arms supply thy Place. Then very thine's a slighted Ty; Then, then she lays thee willing by; While their fond dearer Folds are cast, Not round the Garments, but the Waste. The Pleasures of Phyllis. I Phyllis has a gentle Heart, Willing to the Lover's Courting; Wanton Nature all the Art, To direct her in her Sporting. In th' Embrace, the Look, the Kiss, All is real Inclination; No false Raptures in the Bliss, No feign'd Sighings in the Passion. II But O, who the Charms can speak, Who the Thousand Ways of Toying, When she does the Lover make All a God in the Enjoying? Who, the Limbs that round him move, And constrain him to her Blisses? Who the Eyes that swim in Love, Or the Lips that suck in Kisses? III O the Freaks when mad she grows, Raves all wild with the possessing! O the silent Trance that shows The Delight above Expressing! Every Way she does engage, Idly talking, speechless lying; She transports me with the Rage, And she kills me in her Dying. The Surrender. I I know thy Strength and will give way, Fair Foe, to thy all-powerful Charms. When, sure before to lose the Day, Why should we try the Fate of Arms? Alas! I am a Wretch so weak, To thee so very poor a Thing, One Shot from those bright Eyes would break Through all the Forces I could bring. II Sometimes, when Scorn I apprehend, I shrink, and fain I would not yield; But oh! how vainly I'd pretend, Who can't a Moment keep the Field! Then as less Hopes, and less appear, I sigh, and only find that I, 'Twixt thy Advantage and my Fear, Cannot resist, and would not die. III Then ease a Slave of all his Care, And when he owns your Pow'r to kill, Be generous, and shew you are Too good to have the brutal Will. Treat kindly a poor vanquish'd Heart, And, since it never can be mine, So gently act the Victor's Part, I may be pleas'd to have it thine. The Diffident encouraged. I. Shepherd, why so vain a Fear? Poor frail Nymphs, what they severe! O mistaken in their Mould! 'Tis not they but we are cold. Shew yourself but well inclin'd, Court you warmly, you shall find Woman not more fair than kind. II. See the Breasts, and see the Eyes, These that languish, those that rise; See a thousand Things declare They would yield, would you but dare. Go, Success th' Attempt shall crown; They invite thee to sit down, And will they hold out the Town? Here and there may be a Fool, Idly vain of being cool: Leave the aukward Wretch alone; Forty others will atone; Gentle they and wise shall prove, And take the good Advice of Love. To Celia. I Were, Celia, but thy Heart as kind As thy soft Looks, thy flattering Smiles, What Joys might thence those Vassals find, Whose Hearts their pleasing Force beguiles, While when to bless, and to enslave, Such Kindness with such Charms should strive, The largest Wish no more cou'd crave, Than these could promise, that could give. II But then this Good should be design'd As general as thy Victories; Its noble Object make Mankind, Since Mankind's their extensive Prize, Let dully she but one caress, Who poorly too but one can fire; 'Tis just that bravely all possess Whom all must needs, must needs desire. A SONG. [I will not sigh, or wish alone] Printed in the Oxford Miscellany. 1685. I I will not sigh, or wish alone, Tho' to speak should be in vain. I ne'er can be afraid to own A Passion I must entertain. If you this Address refuse, Blame your faulty Charms, not me. 'Tis but just they should excuse, Since they caus'd this Liberty. II A moderate Passion unreveal'd Smother'd in my Breast had been; Like Embers, that with Sparks conceal'd, A while are warm, then die unseen. But when Charms like yours combine, Such a Fire as mine to raise, Who can the fierce Rage confine? It must needs break out and blaze. The Foolish Delay. In the Year 1688. No more this Dallying and Suspence, Vain Doubts, or heedless Negligence. But think with just Concern and Fears Of passing Days, and coming Years. Pleasures that to receive us wait, If we pass by, and will not bait, Are lost; there's no returning back, That which we let alone, to take. That Stage for ever is pass'd o'er; All we can do's to lose no more, But make our selves the best Amends With the Remainder that attends. Youth must with all its Joys decay; Nor can vain Care prolong its Stay; Spare ne'er so much, spend ne'er so fast, 'Tis all the self same Thing at last. What boots it to be covetous Where Avarice can no Gain produce? What Fool would that Estate not use, Which he howe'er must surely lose. You fear to wear out Love too soon; And let profusely Time run on, That uncontroll'd pursues its Race; Should Pleasure not keep equal Pace? Fruition is a harmless Thing, Drinks fair of a recruiting Spring, Whets the renewing Appetite, Not palls the Relish of Delight. Enjoyment will not harm one Grace, One Charm, one Feature in the Face, Or bring, at Thirty, Wrinkles there, Would not 'till Fifty else appear. Will Parts, for be'ng employ'd decay? Can you e'er kiss those Lips away? Or will that marble snowy Breast The sooner fade for being prest? No; 'tis a fond unjust Presage To think Youth us'd advances Age. Be bold, and when the worst y'have done, The cautious Maid grows old as soon. Does it more fast the Flow'rs destroy When Men the fragrant Scent enjoy? Does Summer hasten from our Clime, Because we use its Harvest Time? No; May would pass as swiftly by Did all its Sweets neglected ly; Should we the Summer's Fruits forbear, Yet Winter would be still as near. Since then Youth too must quit its Room, And Age, that dreadful Winter, come, Age, that dry, shrivel'd, frozen Thing, Lets use our Summer, and our Spring. The Shepherd's Hour. In the Year 1686. I There is in Love a happy Time (Could we the lucky Minute gain) When a just Daring proves no Crime, And feeble Pride resists in vain; Secure of Conquest Man may then invade, Too weak's the poor unguarded Maid, Without assail'd, within betray'd. II When kindled Nature's all on Fire, And with delightful Influence Raises each melting fond Desire, Softens the Mind, and warms the Sense; In that kind tender Moment, e'er it flies, Could I my Chloris but surprize, In vain she'd scorn, in vain be wise. III But we alas! in Darkness rove, The friendly Hour too seldom guess, Through blind mistakes successless prove, And fail for an ill-tim'd Address. Ah Fate! to Man what Favour dost thou show, Thus one kind Minute to bestow, Yet let him not that one foreknow! A Drinking SONG. Occasioned by an Auction at Oxford, in the Year 1685, or 1686. I Let the provident Fop For an Author bid up, 'Till the critical Half-penny carry't; Secure he may be, And unrival'd for me, Unless 'twere an Auction of Claret. II Were Champaign but expos'd, I'd vy with the most, But for useless Books, let them rot all; What the Devil care I Who'll Bellarmine buy, Give me but a Bellarmine Bottle? III Each Glass of good Wine Excells the best Line Of the Learned, the Wise, or the Godly; Each Bottle we count To a Tome does amount, And a Cellar's worth more than a Bodley. IV With Cost, and with Pain We dull Learning obtain; At cheapest 'tis damnable hard Gain; While the Wine we adore, Enlightens us more, And Pleasure gives into the Bargain. V Then about with your Wine, If for Wit you design; Fair Drinking's the Way to acquire it. The fam'd God of Wit To the Name has no Right, But by rip'ning the Grape to inspire it. The Drinker's Plea. I Since Nature Mankind for Society fram'd, He against Nature sins who of Drinking's asham'd. To be nice were of Manhood myself to divest; 'Tis not he who will drink, but who won't is the Beast. Drink's the Joy of our Kind, Man's distinguishing Sin We as Animals love, but we drink as we're Men; 'Tis the sober dull Brute does for Thirst only drink, The Brute that can't laugh, can't be merry, nor think. II How flat without this is our humane Converse? How insipid the Tast, if not heightned with Tierce? How emptily grave, and how heavily gay, If we gossip at Night, or are busy by Day? Let the Fools then of Gallantry, Traffick, and News, The Ruelle, th' Exchange, and the Coffee-house choose. Who the Devil would be to a Virtue a Slave, Only fit for the Statesman, the Fop, or the Knave? III Let's a League against all dead Sobriety join, That wretched Estate of Mistrust and Design; Where Outside, and Forms dear Freedom exclude, And we dare not be pleasant for Fear we prove rude. Where Int'rest a Mask, and Fear's a Disguise, And makes Men unhappy to render them wise. The Drunkard secure on no Danger need think; There's of Prudence no Use, where there's Friendship and Drink. IV Drink, Drink then about, while, all Interest drown'd, Mirth, Humor, and Wit with the Cup shall sail round. We'll laugh, and we'll sing, be bold, and sincere, And removing all Danger we'll banish all Fear; We'll mock at the Cautious, and scorn all Disguise, Begin to be frolick, as we cease to be wise, Till void of Reserves, our jolly free Souls Prove clear as our Liquor, and large as our Bowls. The Captive. I Whilst on those Features happy cast, And moving Air I gaze, Still as one greedy View is past, Surveying with repeated Hast, The Glories of that Face, Lost in Delight I never mind The Danger that I run; 'Till got beyond Retreat I find, When 'tis too late to be declin'd, The Ruin I should shun. II So the fond Insect, void of Care, On Poplar Branches straid, 'Till seiz'd in a fair Amber Snare That dropp'd so soft, and look'd so fair, He found himself betray'd. At first, distilling on the Heart, Love a loose Power may have; But quickly, by unheeded Art, Settling and fixing round the Part, Safe it secures the Slave. III And yet, if you can Pity take Of him your Pow'r disarms, The proud Security forsake Your Eyes can give, and kindly make My Prison in your Arms. The Bondage Men on Force endure Is ever the most weak; The willing Slave is most secure, And those strong Chains are doubly sure Whose Links we would not break. IV Who'd from that lovely Breast remove, Or quit th' enchanted Ground? Those Arms would magick Circles prove. Who, so confin'd, could Freedom love, Or wish to be unbound? There let me, wrapt in pleasing Rest, For ever Captive ly; By those soft gentle Fetters prest! Where could I ever live so blest, Or how so happy dy? The Despairing Lover. I Break, break, my foolish Heart, Loaded with Love, and with Despair opprest. How canst thou bear thy Smart? How rule the Ferment of this lab'ring Breast? No more the swelling Cloud's black Hoard retain; Break, break, thou foolish Heart, and vent th' included Pain. II How cruel is thy Fate, Doom'd to Despair, tho' meeting no Disdain? Thy Nymph, too soft to hate, Shares all thy Cares, and pities all thy Pain. In vain; for all moves not her rigid Will; The Wish may be to save, but the Resolve's to kill. III How can I hope Redress, Sworn not so much as to request a Cure? Who, to preserve her Peace, Have vow'd Despair, and chosen to endure; Silent must be, in pity to her Pain, And never, never ask, for fear I should obtain. IV The Pulses of thy Frame Throb thick with Pain, and strong with Anguish move; The Breath that fans thy Flame, In Sighs now ventilates thy hopeless Love; Each various Aliment of the nat'ral Life, Now feeds but thy Despair, and but foments thy Grief. V Break then, thou foolish Heart; Wisely I'd dy, since I can never live; Make the sad Bus'ness short; Who'd thus still in continu'd Deaths survive? Come, Courage; 'twill but one strong Pang require: Die all at once, and in one mighty Grief expire. To Phyllis. I Phyllis, how long thus wildly gay Shall we false Joys approve? We idly laugh our Time away, And do but fool with Love. For Trifles we great Leisure find; Those warmly are pursu'd. Should we not too a little mind Neglected Flesh and Blood? II Trust me, howe'er the Vain may jest, Or the Severe advise, 'Tis Passion only makes us blest, And only shews us wise. Take Human Life in all its Shapes, Free from Love's gentle Rules; We're all but pert light giddy Apes, Or dull grave solemn Fools. III Think then how we've the past mispent, And what's to come improve; Betimes grow wisely penitent; Take up, and turn to Love. So good a Work needs no Debates; 'Tis high Time 'twere begun. When Pleasure on Repentance waits, Who can repent too soon? To a Mistress whom he had endeavoured to leave loving. Forgive me, dearest Mistress, if I strove To break a rigid Yoak of fruitless Love; Forgive a Crime that but confirms your Pow'r, Forgive a Wretch, who now is yours the more. When Hope was lost, I would have Freedom gain'd, But that too hopeless I was faster chain'd; Springing, and flutt'ring, as I loose would get, I lam'd my Wing to tangle but the Net. So the griev'd Subject would redress his Wrong, And arms, but finds the Tyrant's Force too strong; Sees all his impotent Endeavours brav'd, Fights to be free, and is the more enslav'd. Oh! would'st thou know the Efforts that I made? How every Art I us'd, and every Aid? Aids, which till then unfailing knew to be, But Aids that fail'd, and more than fail'd with me. In flowing Wine I try'd to drown Desire; Then Women sought, and Fire would quench with Fire. False did the Wine, and false the Women prove; The Glass work'd wrong, and made me drunk with Love; And the dull Charms I did in others see, (For dull they were, or dull they seem'd to me) My Passion rais'd for those I found in thee. I fled those Charms, but oh! I could not part From their dear Image rooted in my Heart. When Absence fail'd me, and cou'd nothing do, I came again; again, again would view, To find a Blemish, or to glut my Sight. But this was Madness, and undid me quite; All the Design was turn'd into a Snare, Whilst I unsated found you still more fair. A thousand Ways I strove to break my Chain; A thousand Ways I strove, but all in vain. Fool, this Event no better to foresee; Fool, who so little knew my self and thee. Now better taught, and gaining by my Harms, I own your Pow'r, and here lay down my Arms; May grieve my lost Estate, sigh and deplore, But will contest, but will rebel no more. No; since it is my Fate to be a Slave, Love shall at length his Will in Quiet have. Where's the Discretion of still struggling on? Rising and lab'ring still he keeps me down. Faint with Resistance since I cannot scape, I'll ly indulgent to th' avoidless Rape; No more make head against th' impetuous Stream; Which lost, and feeble I want Pow'r to stem; All I can gain's but to dy out of Breath, And to drown quietly's the wiser Death. SONG. [Why should coy Beauty be so hard] I Why should coy Beauty be so hard To be to Joy persuaded? Why so perversely, stand its Guard, By Love and Youth invaded? Did ever Dame against the Knight, Who came to her redressing, For the rude Giant Jailer fight, And help her own Oppressing? II Such Honour is, the tender Maid With rigid Force restraining; Love soon with Leave would lend his Aid, And end the Tyrant's Reigning. But the poor Fool's so taught to dread Her Friend, her Foe to favour, She thinks it Ruin to be freed, Protection to enslave her. III Be wise ye Fair, and keep not dead Upon your Hands your Treasure; The honest Lover does but plead For a fair Truck of Pleasure; Between the Nymph, and Swain that join In Love 'tis equal Trading; He gains the Riches of her Mine, And she his Vessel's Lading. To Charmion. I O Charmion, while so bright you shine, And I this Heart retain, Why with fond Aim should I decline, What to decline were vain? By Love, and Nature, you and I Were form'd to kill, and form'd to die. II Heav'n must engage, not Reason arm, This Danger to remove, Change, and make you less fit to charm, Or me less apt to love. But there's no Hope as now we are, So very frail, and very fair. III But yet a better Thing might be Which you with Ease might do, If, Charmion, you would smile on me, As I must sigh for you. You might make Love a pleasing Fate, You fav'ring it as you create. IV Then, while you charm'd, I did adore, Tho' both too in Excess, I'd wish each fond Propension more, And not one Beauty less. I could not be too well inclin'd, Nor you too fair when you were kind. The Self-Encouraged. I Fright me no more with idle Fears, Or talk, my Charmion may disdain; So pleasing while the Nymph appears, Her Lover will not think a Thought of Pain. Base Fear, as oft as Hope, deceives, And ever breaks the Lover's Rest, While he who generous Hope believes, Deluded yet is easy, and is blest. II Why should I think so ill of Fate, Or fancy it so hard could prove, To damn a Wretch to die by that Which he was born of all the World to love? 'Twere better Nature to infer (Since Heav'n should just soft Things decree,) That, dooming me to sigh for her, Her it has destin'd too to smile on me. III Her Look is gentle, and her Soul, And I am harmless and sincere. What then should here Success controll? Make such a Nymph to such a Swain severe? It cannot be; so warm a Heart, Such a fond, tender, faithful Love, Whilst her good Nature takes their part, Can never fail, can never fail to move. A SONG made to be sung at a Musick-Meeting. [I.] Come, Stoick, come thou proud Philosopher, Thou, thou that art so cold, and so severe; Who with vain Gravity diseas'd, Art so afraid of being pleas'd. Come listen, listen to our tuneful Strains, View the delightful Nymphs, and ravish'd Swains. Poor lost Philosopher, How wilt thou find thy Passions here? How wish thy self all Eye, and wish thy self all Ear. Chorus. Come Stoick, come thou proud Philosopher, Thou, thou that art so cold, and so severe. II. Who so severe whom Musick cannot charm? So cold whom Beauty cannot warm? But when both, both are combining, Both united Forces joining, Then what Madness 'tis to arm! When so kind too is th' Alarm, And such Softness does impart, Such gladsom Tremblings to the Heart. Chorus. Who so severe whom Musick cannot charm? So cold whom Beauty cannot warm? III. Let loose thy Soul to Joy, Nor call what pleases thee a Toy. Fool he, that wants to be above Gay Delight, and gentle Love! Fool, against himself contriving, Who, with kindly Nature striving, Quarrels with the Sweets of Living. Chorus. Let loose thy Soul to Joy, Nor call what pleases thee a Toy. IV. Virtue, the Mistress of thy Care, Is but a part of Good; Pleasure's the Rest, is lovely fair, And would be wisely woo'd; Cheat not thy self of Bliss was meant thee, But take, take all kind Fate has sent thee. Grand Chorus. All, all at fav'rite Hours improve, Deal in Musick, deal in Love; All thy Faculties employ, To treat thy jolly Nature high, Every Sense allow its Joy, And ev'ry Joy its Luxury; Let not Age have to complain, That neglected Youth was vain, Its Pleasures an untasted Stream; Let not Time, when 'tis gone, Say that nothing was done, And Life scarce so good as a Dream. An Epitaph for G. H. Esq This Monument of mournful Piety, A sorrowing Father consecrates to thee. Nor is Grief his alone; but for thee all Who knew thy Life, conjoyn'd lament thy Fall; Sigh to reflect on thy once lovely Youth, Thy modest Sweetness, thy well-natur'd Truth, The ripe Good Sense that honour'd thy green Years; The pleasing Songs that fix'd our listning Ears; When thou, so form'd for each delightful End, To charm the Mistress, to endear the Friend, From Friend, from Mistress, from thy self too torn, Ly'st, lost to all, in an ungrateful Urn. Why Fate so wildly are thy Shafts addrest? Why in such Hast with thy dull hated Rest? Sleep should wait Night; but 'tis severely soon, Thus to be forc'd to Bed before 'tis Noon. To the Memory of a very excellent Person. Candid, beneficent, sincere and free, (For Virtue, join'd with Piety in thee) Whose feeble Body found thy Mind yet strong, And prov'd a Spirit which it could not wrong; While mourning Friends do their own Loss deplore, Whom now thou may'st assist or please no more, Take thou sweet Rest, and be thy Fate thy Gain, (And Gain it is to lose a State of Pain) Nature no more with Patience now at Strife, Secure in Death, and got well rid of Life. Upon his loving Two at one Time. I Would you know how I love, now at once I love Two? Nor to this am more false, nor to that am more true; With either alone, her only I mind, But when I see both, to no one I'm inclin'd; Thus equal together, and equal apart, They each have my Love, and have neither my Heart. II If I'm absent from both, I'm for neither in Pain, Yet am pleas'd to be present with either again. Possessing but one would ravish my Breast, And yet missing both shall not rob it of Rest. But who knows what Fortune a Lover may find? When two are his Aim, there are two to be kind. Another. I Young Iris I love, and young Amoret too, With Eyes, and a Heart what less should I do? So pretty the Pair, 'twere unjust to be true, And pay one alone what to either is due; Love's owing of Right where'er Beauty we view. II I render to both what their Charms may require; And neither love less, while I t'other desire. Together I love them, I love them apart, Wish each in my Arms, as they're each in my Heart, And seek double Joy to relieve double Smart. III Which best I shall love the Nymphs must agree; Her I will love best, who best shall love me; The yielding and kind, the triumphant shall reign; But ah! would both yield, both be kind to the Swain, How well then might all become even again. Of his Mistress. My Mistress so bewitches me in Love, No Hours at Rest from her Inchantments move; When she is present, to all else I'm blind, And absent still she's present to my Mind; No Crowd so great her Image to exclude, And from her Spirit there's no Solitude; None, none from her; nor any do I crave, 'Tis Solitude and her that I would have. Of Arista. I Nature in so just a Mould Kind has cast Arista's Face, The Figure might almost uphold The Want of ev'ry other Grace; Tho' she had drawn the Skin less fair, Had of the separate Features took no Care, Nor giv'n 'em that endearing Air. II Softly warm, and gravely sweet, Shining temperately bright, Where something strong and gentle meet, And mingled Shade adorns the Light. Nothing dull, wandring, or design'd, Nothing unworthy tender Womankind, Nothing a Lover would not find. III If she smile, 'tis easy Joy; If she blush, 'tis handsome Shame; If she with checking Frowns look coy, Who would desire a Nymph too tame? But then the Languishings compare, The Looks of Anguish with the Sighs of Care; Love, Love himself is ever there. Of Aelia. I So wild young Aelia's Glances move, Her Looks such Pleasure wear, She can as soon not give us Love, As she can give us Care. Dullness and Grief her Presence fly; Her Cupid is a Child of Joy; Who amid so much Life can dy? II When round her quick'ning Beams she darts, Well omen'd Passions rise; She smiles herself into our Hearts, And tickles with her Eyes. Whate'er the Nymph may have design'd, Nature at least was well inclin'd; She made her fair, and meant her kind. Of Flora. I Flora has Youth alone might do, Had she no more to boast; But she has Prettynesses too, That scarce in Age are to be lost; A Face that promises to please us long, Just come to Age of being Young. II Plump as the Grape, when the ripe Juice Fills out the handsome Skin, Or Olive, wanting to produce The ready Balm that waits within; Fresh as the Morn just blushing from the East, And gay as Meads in Flow'rs new drest. III Love, for whose sake these Gifts are sent, Teach her their Use to know, And tell her Beauty's Bloom was meant For more than to be set to Show. The Prime does here the Harvest with it bring, And thy best Summer's in the Spring. Of Amalthæa. I Amalthæa has a Form Might to the Coldest give Desire; Love has no need of Eyes so warm, Such a Breast as mine to fire. To be but Woman is enough with me; And then how wild the Flame must be, The Lover I, the Mistress she. II She the youthful, she the fair, With Smiles so joyful, Looks so gay, That perfect Spring laughs in her Air, And the Nymph is very May. As May she blooms to the delighted View, As May, for other Senses too, Has flow'ry Sweets, has Honey Dew. III Whose Kiss on her Lips shall rest, And suck the Freshness of the Field? Who, who shall on her well-urg'd Breast, Make her all her Richness yield? Then Loves, then Joys from every Part shall swarm, Then every Sweet, and every Charm, Shall be more sweet, shall be more warm. Of Levia. I When Levia's gay, her youthful Spring Of Charms is drest in all its Grace; Joy in her Speech does chirping sing, And Brightness plays around her Face. The Sense she spirits to that Height, And treats the Fancy with such Bliss, That our Touch seems to feel her Sight; To view her Lip's a very Kiss. II Her Eyes give Love such warm Alarms, That Age itself dares not be cold; While for th' Enjoyments of her Arms Our utmost Youth would seem too old. When Nature serv'd our Pleasure best, We should complain she fail'd our Will, And rise half sighing from the Feast, Full of Delight, yet longing still. At Richmond-Wells. Occasioned by a Commendation of the Prospect. I Away you Idlers, cease to gaze, Cease your Delight, and cease your Praise. What's all this boasted Landskip Scene? The various Plain's well-checquer'd Green? The polish'd River's humid Light? The Villas, each worth all our Sight? Another Time the Toys might do; But nobler Charms claim now your View. II Dull Swains, will you a Fabrick find Like the fair Frame of Womankind? Shall Gardens, or shall Fields contest With the sweet Lip, or fruitful Breast? Can Meads, or silver Currents vy With the gay Cheek, or shining Eye? Poor Earth, and Streams, a heavy, rude, Cold Scene to that of Flesh and Blood. III Go, go and gaze upon the Fair; View Nature's loveliest Prospects there. What tho' the Pleasure lead to Pain? The Pain to Pleasure leads again. Tell the bright Nymph what she has done, She kind may make thy Cares her own, And grateful for thy well-lost Heart, Requite thee with a better Part. The Prospect of the Ladies Bathing. Begun in the Gallery of the Cross-Bath, In the Year 1710. So in some Piece have I beheld Angels discover'd and conceal'd. The youthful Air, the Heav'nly Face Was seen, and all the upper Grace; The Rest, deny'd the Searcher's Eye, We might divine, but not descry. Ye silly Gazers, have a Care, Nor Thought, nor Sight indulge too far. Who knows how soon 'twill be too late? What on one dangerous Glance may wait? How will you sigh, what will you do, Should the fair Nymph prove cruel too, When close pursu'd, too weak to fly, By your own lov'd Desires you die! This might they mean, whose Songs of old, The Fate of the poor Hunter told, Who rashly, in her watry Den The Goddess view'd severe to Men; She frown'd, and he a Prey became To those that us'd to catch him Game. But Fate has better Omens here; Here 'twere absurd to be severe. Let Cynthia, and her Streams agree, And cold as one another be. These genial Waters are Love's own; These had the Grecian Muse but known, From their apt Bed she well had sung, Not the cold Sea's, kind Venus sprung. These would fond Salmacis have lov'd, In these had she her Lover prov'd, Perhaps she had not found the Boy Remain so cool, remain so coy. See how the Sanguine Cheek they paint, Plant living Roses where they want, Kindling in each improving Dame New Beauties, and in us new Flame, Who smile, and hope at least a Glow So kindly, may yet farther go; Happy, if every grateful Maid To Springs, which thus her Triumphs aid, Would let her equal Heart conform, As soft, as healing, and as warm. Delia at Astrop-Wells. I Delia engages every Eye, Her Sight rejoyces every Breast, Her Ear, whene'er she passes by, Hears by all Tongues her Charms confest. For her in Morning Walks we join, For Her to Evening Balls we move, She first gives Relish to our Wine, And she's the Wish of all our Love. II For her Desire feels no Decay, But springs as when our Youth began; For her the Grave awhile is gay, The frail Divine is very Man. Here Tory with the Whig can side; Rome her Supremacy obeys, And no Fanatick Fools divide About her Worship and her Praise. III Ask not what 'tis affects us so, Or what the Features that excell; The Beauty's dull, which, op'ning slow, Must wait to be examin'd well. Ere we have Leisure to compare Her Beams, like Light, themselves they show, Yet are they found more lovely fair, The more we seek, the more we know. IV Distinct then all we reconcile From Eyes that as the Morning glance, From Lips that flatter in their Smile, And Feet that wanton in the Dance; And Air, like Skies of happy Days, Serene with soft indulgent Grace, While to our Hearts the Nymph conveys The gentle Pleasure of her Face. V Nothing fantastick, loud, coquet, A Train, or Notice to invite; In easy Nature's Light all set, She trusts Mankind to do it Right. Seeking from all a Lover's Doom, So decent all, and sweet appears, For Hopes we find too little Room, Yet can allow no Place for Fears. Revengeful Courtship. In the Year 1685. I It is not that I yet remain The Slave I was before, That I a Courtship still maintain, And seemingly adore. Cool Spite continues my Address, Loves Follies to atone; While thus I force you to express My Sufferings in your own. II Whether to Love you yield or no, Indifferent now within, I, like a subtil Gamester, go A certain Way to win. Secure, what Course soe'er you take, Ill Luck I am above. Due Satisfaction you must make To Malice or to Love. III 'Tis all but strain'd Hypocrisy, When coyly you disdain; And though when prest you still deny, You still deny with Pain. Nature, my good kind honest Friend, Is on the juster Side, Helps me to work my spiteful End, And rights me on your Pride. IV Nature, like an ill Conscience, Exerts its pointed Sting; Provok'd it goads the wounded Sense, And tortures you within. I'll help it on, and still take Care The Foe awake to keep; Nor suffer vain Amusements e'er To lull it once asleep. V Th' Endearments, Joys, and Ecstasies, Which yielding Virgins find, With Care brought still before your Eyes Shall rack your longing Mind. I'll haunt you still with Tales of Love, Heighten each Circumstance, Each Pleasure artfully improve, Your Anguish to advance. VI Thus to revenge your false Disdain, False Love I will employ; With studied Malice work your Pain, And then that Pain enjoy. Now, Scornful, if you dare, deny; This shall not you secure. The Love you will not satisfy, Vain Wretch, you shall endure. On the Friendship between Three Ladies. In the Year 1686. I Tell me, fair mortal Trinity, What wise, what noble Usury Is this you practise, to improve Love to yourselves by giving Love? Interest and Love were never so combin'd. How can you be so selfish, and so kind? II All so exchange each others Hearts, Each gets by that with which she parts; None giv'n by Halves, or giv'n in vain, 'Tis equal Bounty, equal Gain. Mysterious! Each has but one Heart to give, Yet each, for one she gives, does two receive. III 'Tis thus in tuneful Concerts we Find three well-suited Parts agree; While each does equally assist With its whole Musick both the rest; And with full Concord jointly all conspire To make th' harmonious Amity entire. IV Fair Friendship thus while you improve, You yet should leave a Place for Love. We will not say, if one must yield, Which has best Title to the Field. No Question needs, where neither need to lose; The Lover wants what the Friend cannot use. V So the Great Trinity above, Tho' they eternal Union prove, Yet by their Blessings often show Kindness and Love to us below. One never does with t'other interfere; That lets not this, nor may this that impair. To a married Lady, to be more or to be less Free. Written in the Year 1722. Why should an idle Marriage Vow, Where Love has often least to do, To my Success injurious prove, Whose End is nothing else but Love? It is not whose, but what, you are, I make the Bus'ness of my Care. Your Face, your Mien, the various Charms That promise Lux'ry in your Arms, Are all that Lovers mind. If these At Freedom are Mankind to please, Shall richly One be singly blest With Property in all the Rest? Alone enjoy what all desire, And Envy raise our Longings higher? Fruit taken from another's Tree, Tho' 'tis not miss'd, and spar'd might be, Is something yet to th' Owner lost: His Gard'ner treats us at his Cost. But where's the Harm, the Lord away, If in his Grove awhile I stray? Or in a Stream get Leave to swim Which still remains the same to him? Thus would I wrong no real Right, Nor lessen your Good Man's Delight. Mine would be Favour; his is Due; This he commands; for that I sue. You both might yield with different Sense Of Justice and Benevolence; And must allow 'tis nobler yet To grant a Grace, than pay a Debt: 'Tis sweeter too, and this well done Might be of Use more Ways than one. Or we mistake, or you could bear And like a little Change of Air; And willing try how far Love's Game With a new Gamester is the same. And will you then yourself consine, In vain to Liberty incline! Nor make, your usual Meals to mend, Sometimes Collation with a Friend? As 'tis in Dress, so 'tis in Love, Fantastick Changes few approve. But always put your Husband on? 'Tis wearing still your Wedding Gown. One Habit, long as it will hold, May keep from Nakedness and Cold; Yet most rejoyce themselves to see Furnish'd with some Variety. The Country Dame, besides th' Array That serves her well for ev'ry Day, For better Times, and to be drest, Will have some one fresh Thing at least. However pleasant's our own House, 'Tis dull to keep to it too close. Shifting the Scene the Mind relieves; Nor only fair Diversion gives, But makes us too, when pleas'd or cloy'd, With what's abroad to be enjoy'd, Back with renew'd good Humour come, And a fresh Relish of our Home. So you returning entertain'd With Pleasures from a Lover gain'd, The good old Spouse may seem half new, And almost be a Lover too; And ev'n himself a Gainer be By the short Turns you take with me; Wondring at once, and charm'd to find Your Kiss more warm, Embrace more kind. If all these gentle Reasonings fail, And Vows and Scruples still prevail; If Favour is not to be shown, Nor for our Sakes, nor for your own; For both be nice, and scrup'lous quite, Nor boggle only at Delight. Move us no more than you must need, Nor wilfully our Wishes feed With Things so luscious, we conclude We in good Manners should be rude, Your Honour try our own to save, And shew at least that we are brave. Talk more insipid, look more cold; A Coward should not act the Bold. They who take Pleasure to provoke, Till just 'tis coming to the Stroke, Ought to expect we should demand Fair Satisfaction at their Hand. We're wrong'd when you a Conduct use First to invite, and then refuse. Women by Hopes they give are bound, And ought to heal who seek to wound. The Cautious Inclination. I Suavia, your Face has done its part, And giv'n me a good Will to Love: The Rest depends upon your Heart; Mine by its Motions means to move. Tho' fond I look, and soft I woo, And forty amorous Things may do, All are but Offers, which I make To try how real Love will take. II Not that I prize your Treasures less, But of my self would take some Care; For 'tis not what the Fair possess, But what they will the Lover spare. What does a Nation's Wealth avail, If with that Wealth they will not deal? Should rashly I my Goods unlade Without good Signs that they will trade? III Open in Smiles a welcome Scene, And Hope, a pleasing Prospect, lend; Add gentle Words, with Sighs between, Advancing Passion to befriend. Tho' loose we play about the Key, Ere we in earnest put to Sea, 'Tis not enough the Sky look fair; We must have Gales of favouring Air. To Suavia. I Prithee, Suavia, let me know Whether I should love or no. 'Tis what gladly I would do, Would you joyn, and do so too; But I hate the lame Affair, When the Nymph won't love her Share. II Nature in our Make has shown Love not meant for one alone. One may languish, one complain, One alone may love to Pain: Two must love, ere Love's a Blessing; Without Two is no Possessing. III Kindly then for Love declare, And assist to make a Pair. All is ready on my Part; All is ready but your Heart. Lose not an inclining Swain; Where's the Joy to please in vain? On her bidding him talk no more of Love. What would my faithless Mistress do? Is she afraid to find me true? Why does she stop the gentle Tale? Not for himself alone the Lover would prevail. Would she once lend an equal Ear, Love should nor false, nor vain appear; She but condemns because she will not hear. Ah! Nymph unjust to judge a Cause untry'd! Ah! foolish Maid her Lover to destroy! The Dying can at most but serve her Pride, The Living 'tis must give her Joy. To the Fair Infidel. Why this severe and strange Distrust Of Vows so likely to be just? Why so unwilling to believe A Passion you were form'd to give? The Old might doubt, th' Unhandsome fear, No Oaths to them can be sincere. But is it a Thing hard or rare To love the Youthful and the Fair? Away with Infidelity, That wrongs at once yourself and me. My Faith does in your Beauty shine; Trust your own Looks, then credit mine, In whose fond Warmth those Fires are shown Which yours into my Breast have thrown. None lightly are presum'd to feign Where all Men see good Cause of Pain. Who e'er was thought to counterfeit Who in Mid-June complain'd of Heat? Love is like Beauty, Nature's Part, And Beauty often is all Art. But should I thence a Freak begin Of censuring each well colour'd Skin? Why then should you in Love affect A false Complexion to suspect? And when all fair and native shows, Only a painted Form suppose? Ungentle Maid! whate'er you plead, Not Caution does these Scruples breed. But all too easily are hard To credit Pains they don't regard. Yes, 'tis your Heart that is in Fault, If mine can be deceitful thought. Did you the amorous Tale approve, Had you a Breast that favour'd Love, Th' ungrateful Doubts would vanish; few Object to Things they wish were true. 'Tis the not being well inclin'd Makes us so many Atheists find. Religion's question'd; but the Cause Is that we live not to its Laws. The Good are still least scrupulous, Least anxious to prevent Abuse; Knowing that more their Bus'ness lies To be compassionate than wise. Suppose us false; ours is the Blame; Your Kindness still would be the same. But why they false, who so pursue, And take such Pains to be thought true? However Cheats we Beggars call, Few beg who have no need at all. No, 'tis cold Want of Charity That makes the Fair so faithless be. You want a Colour to evade Being oblig'd to give us Aid; So meaning no Relief to grant, Will not believe that we're in Want. To his Mistress advising him to return to Indifference. I No, no; this Heart was made for Love, And Love that Face was made to move. What should ensue but warm Desire Between such Fuel and such Fire? Good Seed in fruitful Ground you sow, And would you thence have nothing grow? II Talk not of Cure; why should I bend My Thoughts to work so dull an End? 'Tis what I may be forc'd to chuse, If you all better Hopes refuse. But who, that could avoid th' ill Lay, Such a vain saving Game would play? III 'Tis swimming hard against the Stream To gain the Point from whence I came; The wretched 'Scape of a Retreat, Built on the Loss of a Defeat; A poor last Shift for Lovers meant; But Love, and Love's the first Intent. IV To answer Nature's social Ends, We should not part, but meet as Friends; I should love on as now I do, And you begin to love so too; You might give Pleasure; I could gain, Ceasing to love, but Rest from Pain. V Perhaps not that; for other Eyes Again might make my Heart their Prize. Though now the Pris'ner in your Breast Is lodg'd secure from all the rest; Yet once got loose it will be free To fall into new Slavery. VI Why should you put me then to strain For what, when compass'd, may be vain? Whether again some one I chuse, Who ill again her Pow'r may use, Or restless more, tho' less confin'd, Live Slave at large to Womankind? VI No; what I am, let me be still, Nor make me false against my Will. Bid me not change, make me not roam; But fairly change yourself at Home. Leave me to Love for which I'm born, And only you correct your Scorn. Hope. SONG. She says I do not, cannot move her, With all my Love a fruitless Lover: Yet if I some good Signs may trust, The Nymph at Heart should be more just. Tell me, Love, what should I do? Which think false, and which think true? Since there somewhere must be Feigning, Mayn't it be in the Disdaining? That is properest to be Art, And Love should be Nature's Part; Against our Wish 'tis hard believing, And Hope at worst is sweet Deceiving. Let me hope then; if I err, I thus the kinder Faith prefer, Think best for me, and best of her. SONG. [Near the Banks of a Stream, in the Gloom of a Grove] I Near the Banks of a Stream, in the Gloom of a Grove, While the Waves toss below, and the Winds press above, As I sit all alone full of Iris and Love; I'm mov'd with the Scene to find nothing at Rest, And think on the Tempest that urges my Breast. II Then mounting with Passion, and sinking with Care, My Blood is the River, my Breath is the Air; But when I the Rage and the Tumult compare, I sigh to find nothing so little at Rest, As I with the Tempest that urges my Breast. III But ah! I cry, ah! the bewitching dear Maid That raises this Storm, were she too in this Shade, The Commotion to see, and the Tumult to aid, The Tempest would then rise so high in my Breast, That the Winds and the Waves would seem quite at Rest. IV And yet 'twere not hard a sweet Calm to restore; A little Rain falls, and the Storm passes o'er, And she has a Lap, and Love has a Show'r, That fairly and kindly would quiet my Breast, And lay the fierce Tempest with Pleasure to Rest. V But oh! how I should of the Quiet complain, A little too long should the Calm but remain! How wish for, and want my dear Tempest again! Too often it could not return to my Breast, When still it should rise to be so laid to Rest. The Dream. I I dreamt of her whom I adore: What could an absent Swain do more? I dreamt of Love, and fond Desire: What other Dream should she inspire? Oh, how I clasp'd the trembling Shade! How try'd to warm the Fairy Maid? I sigh'd, I panted, prest, pursu'd, Did all a waking Lover could; When just as th' airy Nymph was growing kind, Sleep fled, and left forsaken Joy behind. II Who knows but Love contriv'd it so, And would let Things no further go? Perhaps 'twere Pity to delude And mock a Lover with a Cloud. But oh! how well might she go on, And finish what her Shade begun! In me no State a Change can make; I sleep to Love as well as wake. All wou'd be right, would she her Part but keep, Awake as kind, as in her Lover's Sleep. The WARNING. To a Mistress, to engage her to take more Care of a hopeful Love and a conscionable Lover. I Unnatural Parent of a Love Which well your tend'rest Care might move. What do you with it mean to do, That it finds no Regard from you? If it must not be fondly bred, At least it ought to be kept warm and fed; Else 'twill not only froward grow, and cry, But languish too, and waste and die. II Born strong, and for long Living made, (Might it obtain the needful Aid) Expos'd, that Strength will only serve To make it longer e'er it starve. The firmest Building cannot bear To be left desolate without Repair. Nature would fail, if he that did create, Concurr'd not to uphold its State. III Think you there's nothing to be done To keep the Ground that we have won? How much has such Presuming cost? How much good Interest so been lost? Howe'er engag'd, howe'er inclin'd, If where they most might hope, they nothing find, All their warm Zeal with Coldness paid, or Pride, Men will make shift to quit their Side. IV In Conscience what can you expect From the Neglected but Neglect? More generous Measures then concert, Nor force th' unwilling to desert; Who modestly demands of you Not all he wants, nor all the Lover's Due. His Passion but subsist; for his full Pay, He'll wait your own convenient Day. V Can't you to all his Vows afford A fav'ring Smile, a gentle Word? Something to nourish Hope? more low No Lover should, or Love can go. However lightly some may feed, More or less Sustenance all Creatures need. Nothing to live on Nothing long can bear; Very Camælions must have Air. SONG. [How long thus shall I love her without Measure?] I How long thus shall I love her without Measure? And love her thus too without Gain? What Thanks to her, if her Face give me Pleasure? All that with Choice she gives is Pain. II Hard do I seek for Something to delight me, Yet not a lasting Shadow find: If her Looks wear no cruel Frowns to fright me, No Smiles, no Softnings dress them kind. III If I swear Passion, if I tell my Grieving, And hint her loving but her Part, Idly she there affects a Disbelieving, And here resolves to want a Heart. IV Yet I go on endeavouring at improving To me a cold ungrateful Soil; Charm'd to her Love cannot attempt Removing, But make the Wish endear the Toil. Love's Partiality. Say not other Nymphs there are, Fairer some, and more as fair. This I know as well as you, If the knowing this would do. Say not, were she well-inclin'd, To my utmost Wishes kind, She no more for me could do Than some others might do too. And this too as well I know, Would Love let me fancy so. But while thus so far above Other Nymphs, the Nymph I love, Howe'er Things themselves may be, Or you talk, or I agree, Methinks were she well-inclin'd, Were she to my Wishes kind, She for me could something do, More than others could do too; Methinks too none fairer are, Methinks too none are so fair! Could I ever weary grow Of my doating on her so; And, as she makes vain the Love, Should I the vain Love remove; I might yield what I agree; Things would seem as Things would be. Then she would not be more fair Than the Nymphs that fairer are; Others then, who well-inclin'd, To my Wishes might be kind, Full as much for me could do, And I so could fancy too. Now whate'er my Eyes may see, Or my Reason say to me, Still my Love my Heart does tell That they see and say not well; And I doat upon her so, I can't think ev'n what I know. After all perhaps for me Well it is it so should be. Sure 'tis sweet to love so well; And who Love's last Fate can tell? One Day she, who now so vain Makes it seem, may love again; If ev'n now she does not so More than I'm allow'd to know. Then my self to her may be All that now she is to me; Then may she against her Swain, (With more Truth, alike in vain) Told how many more there are That much more deserve her Care, Find, howe'er they may excell, None lov'd less can please so well; Nor perhaps may willing yield, That he is so much excell'd, Or that any Swains there are, That do more deserve her Care; While, by a well-wishing Heart Drawn into a partial Part, Her fond Judgment for his Sake Does its utmost to mistake; And her very Sight grown kind, Sees with Eyes of Love that's blind. Wou'd it not be well for me, Would it not it so should be? Ill nor would it be for her; Love does wisely so to err; What it ever needs must do; All in Love are partial too, Giving their Beloved more, Than e'er Nature did before, Ev'n where Nature has before Giv'n so much there needs no more. What tho' all's not real here? Real good Effects appear. What tho' Fancies they pursue Joys of Fancy yet are true. Thus, while common Swains the Fair Can possess but as they are. Th' happy Lover both partakes, What they have, and what he makes. Thus above all Envy'ing blest, To themselves each Pair's the best; And the best Love e'er must know So can be no more than so. There are Fair Ones much more fair Than ev'n other Fair ones are. But so fair none ever are, But there others are as fair. 'Tis the same with Lips and Arms, And whate'er in Woman charms, Some are better than the rest; Of the better none are best. So unequal, equal so With us too the Talents go. All those Wonders Lovers find But in one of either Kind, And which so bewitch them too, That no one besides can do, To the Lovers only known Are the Work of Love alone. Of his Love. I My dear Mistress all may praise, But none loves her so as I; They with eager Wishes gaze; I not only wish but dy. If I hope, or I despond, Still I long, and still am fond, Doat on her every least Delight, And grudge all else her very Sight. II Ah, if he, who best does love, Might not please below the rest! If she wou'd so equal prove To prefer him in her Breast! Ah, if she but lov'd again Half so well as loves her Swain! For 'twere fond Hope too high to swell, To dream her loving quite as well. III Sweet it is her Eyes to meet Glancing secret tow'rds her Swain. But too bitter's the Retreat, When the Look's call'd in again. Sweet to Lovers 'tis to find Something to mistake for kind; How then if she shou'd willing show What no Mistake could think not so? Generous Love. SONG. I Fain I wou'd not love in vain; Yet 'tis Death to give her Pain. Pain she shews, and Pain of Love; But oh! who that Pain does move? For 'tis Death to give her Pain; Yet I would not love in vain. II If 'tis he who it shou'd move, Why this Checking still his Love? If 'tis not, why such Distress When she doubts that Love is less? Sure I am I give her Pain; 'Tis but Chance I love in vain. III Let the Chance be what it will, 'Tis my Choice to love her still. One Day she may think fair Rest Shou'd be giv'n his generous Breast, Who, in fear to give her Pain, Hazards loving her in vain. On a Paraphrase of the eighth Psalm in Verse, by the Honourable Mrs. Verney at eleven Years of Age. The Maid that was for Delphick Priestess fit Was young indeed, but she was Woman yet. Too strong were thought for any weaker Age, The Poet's Numbers, and the Prophet's Rage. Some Years of vulgar Childhood yet untold, This Virgin's Breast can larger Raptures hold; From higher Oracles does she rehearse Diviner Truths and in diviner Verse; What David thought makes in our Numbers known, And on his sacred Sense ingrafts their own. Rude to her Sex, and innocent of Love, She feels the Warmth that Piety can move; By which impregnate her Poetick Mind Yields this fair Offspring, where surpriz'd we find, (What does all customary Laws defy) That born so soon that never is to dy. For Plants with Art we think to force our Clime, And in wrong Months will have them e'er their Time. Faint the Complexion, nothing is the Tast; All a false Shew, and an unansw'ring Hast. But if kind Nature by some rarer Chance The happy Season does herself advance, 'Tis, tho' an early, an effectual Spring, Kindly the Product she ev'n then does bring. Præcocious so is that which here we meet, The Colour generous, and the Relish sweet; Nothing to shew (did we not know the Time) Th' uncommon Season, or the colder Clime. When in the Temple Jesus once appear'd, And hearing Doctors was of Doctors heard, All gaz'd astonish'd at the God-like Child, Whom mere Twelve Years had with such Knowledge fill'd: So are we, reading what more young she writ, Struck with so strange a Puberty of Wit; Ready to cry, with Admiration fir'd, 'Tis more than human, and must be inspir'd. Yet more, and more as every way he grew, In Age, in Stature, and in Wisdom too: So shall she rise, and kind advancing Time To each exalted State shall see her climb; Shall with her own exalt her Muse's Size, And animate her Strains as well as Eyes. Perusing then what then she shall indite, Charm'd with the Strength, the Beauty, and the Height, We with more ease may what she was allow At writing Things we read with Wonder now. Thus the bright June can show a forward Sun, When in some Months the Dawn is scarce begun; Lively the Light, and vigorous is the Heat; But there's a Zenith still the Glory to compleat; Mounted to which Perfection of his Course, We in full Sense of his Meridian Force, Confess, tho' justly we did those adore, All were but Morning Beams that shone before. Of his Verse. Thus has, as Fancy led, the Poet sung, The Great, the Good, the Beauteous and the Young; Mars his fierce Steeds, and Venus her soft Doves; Of publick Glories, and of private Loves. If rude the Numbers, uncorrect the Strain, 'Tis his own Stile, and an unlabour'd Vein. In love with Pleasures, more in love with Ease, Studies that pleas'd him most could not as Studies please. In Learning still he rov'd from Sort to Sort, Change his Refreshment, Poetry his Sport. Yet oft he dipt in the Castalian Stream, (The Hope of Fame his least regarded Dream) Glad for his Prince and Nation both to raise His Tax of Fortune, and his Tax of Praise; And joy'd, as Youth and Passion danc'd along, His Loves to flatter with the Muses Song. Here if his Venus he too loose has drest, And laid too bare the Purpose of his Breast, Let the Fair own at least the honest Fire, That does not with false Light disguise Desire; Nor, earthy, meant to warm a mortal Maid, Would Incense seem to a vain Goddess paid; Let them forgive an almost harmless Aim, That sought their Favours, not to wound their Fame; Let them, if still they must condemn, repair To the State Muse, and find his Honour there; The Patriot Zeal, the Love of Liberty, The Hate of Wrong, and Scorn of Flattery; (Virtues sincere, that nobly did become Old upright England once, and Greece, and Rome) Let these atone, if in less Things he fail, Approve the worthy, and excuse the frail. While through all Time, their Value must endure Age soon enough does amorous Errors cure. TRANSLATIONS. The Beginning of the Second Book of Lucretius. 'Tis sweet, when Tempests vex the troubled Main, From Land to view the lab'ring Sailor's Pain; Not that another's Danger, or Distress, Gives the Delight, or is a Happiness; But that 'tis sweet, since Evils are, to see Evils from which our dearest selves are free. 'Tis sweet to view, at Distance from the Harms, Embattled Legions, and encountring Arms. But nothing there is sweeter (if so sweet) Than to possess the fair and sacred Seat (Securely fortify'd, serenely high) Of Learning, and of right Philosophy: Thence to behold a wandring World below, On Seas of Business tossing to and fro; Each in his Way, and seeking some vain End, Dispute Nobility, in Wit contend; And all their Pains employ, and every Hour, To reach the Height of Wealth, and Top of Pow'r. Wretched and blind! in what superfluous Strife, What Hazards, what a dark Mistake of Life, Our poor allotted Time we fool away, Short as it is, and of precarious Stay! Is it not plain, amidst our vain Desires, That modest Nature nothing more requires (Nothing in earnest, and concern'd to gain) But that, the Body free from noxious Pain, The Mind may too enjoy an equal Share From Fear remov'd, and undisturb'd with Care? But now our Bodies, to secure their Ease, Few Things will serve, and few will serve to please, And please them so, that often nothing high'r, Nothing more tastful Nature can require. If costly Sconces hold not waxen Lights, To glorify the Revels of our Nights; If Gold nor Silver from th' exhausted Mine Gleam in the Rooms, or in the Service shine; If no sweet Instrument's melodious Sound From rich and vaulted Roofs improv'd rebound. Yet on the downy Turf together laid, Beneath an ample Tree's exalted Shade, Near a soft Stream that tuneful glides along, With Birds around that add their chearful Song, With easy Elegance, at cheap Expence, We may indulge the well-delighted Sense. Chief when the Year his smiling Season yields, And paints with golden Flow'rs the verdant Fields. Will an embroider'd Quilt at all asswage, Or the rich Bed's rich Dye, the Fever's Rage? No; still the Man must ly, and toss as long, His Limbs as restless, and his Fire as strong; And with plain Serge, and homely Rugg, a Cure Might equal find, as speedy and as sure. Why then, if Riches, if Nobility, If very Empire nothing signify, Not to the Body, we may safe confess They to the Mind can yet contribute less. Unless perhaps, when the vain Potentate Beholds, in all their Glory and their State, His marshal'd Legions flame on the Campaign, And wide-spread Fleet press ardent thro' the Main, Then every Superstition in a Fright, Flies the august, and formidable Sight; Of Death the Terrors humbly disappear, And leave the Breast at Ease, and calm, and clear. But if this is a Folly too extream, Ridiculous, and but a Madman's Dream; If following Cares, and if persisting Fears, Nor dread the Sound of Arms, nor Flash of Spears; In Courts familiar if with Kings they're bold, In Scorn of Purple, and Contempt of Gold; Why do we doubt but that this wild Pursuit Of Things of Shew, which yield so little Fruit, Is Error all, admitting no Defence? Is all but downright Penury of Sense? Considering too that, taking Things aright, Our whole of Life is but a Sort of Night. For as weak Children, tremblingly dismay'd, Are in the Dark of ev'ry Thing afraid: So we by Day, and in the Face of Light, Frame empty Visions, and ourselves affright With Phantoms full as foolish, and as vain, As those which in the Night fond Children feign. These Terrors then, this Darkness, and these Dreams, Not the gay Morning, not the mid-day Beams Of a bright Sun can vanquish and dispel, But Reason's Light, and Nature studied well; And these, and only these, the Mind will clear From gloomy Care, and from fantastick Fear. Of the Soul of the World, and the Revolution of the Souls of Men, from the sixth Book of Virgil. (Beginning at Line 724.) Principio Cœlum, &amp; Terras, Camposq; liquentes, &amp;c. First understand that Earth, and Sea, and Air, The Lunar Globe, and each Titanian Star, With universal Matter's wide Machine, A Spirit feeds and animates within. Infus'd through all the Limbs the mingling Soul With the great Frame unites, and agitates the Whole. From hence Particulars themselves derive, The Race of Men, and Kinds of Cattle live, And Volatiles that Air sublimely breathe; And all the Monsters of the Deep beneath. Of fiery Force and of Celestial Birth, The Seeds themselves, as far as Limbs of Earth, And noxious Bodies, and a dying Frame Dull not the Vigour, and depress the Flame. But mingled thus, frail Passions they receive; They fear, and covet; they rejoice, and grieve, Nor in the Prison of dark Flesh confin'd, Look back aloft, but to the Skies are blind. Nor, ev'n when Life's last Day has set them free, Is there an End; not all the Misery Concludes, not all the foul corporeal Stains; But long concreted, manifold Remains Will stay (nor can we otherwise conceive) And strangely to their old Acquaintance cleave. Therefore for Cure they'r exercis'd with Pain, And of old Ill the Punishment sustain. Expanded some (the less polluted Minds) Are hung to toss and whiten in the Winds; In others, as th' Infection may require, 'Tis cleans'd in Waters, or burnt out with Fire. All in our Shades our Suff'rings have below, And through the Course of some Purgation go. Then, set at large, Elysium we possess, And range, a Few, the Fields of Happiness; Till Length of Time, th' allotted Period past, Has all th' inveterate Taint remov'd at last; And pure restor'd, as in the native Frame, Th' Ætherial Sense, and clean Aerial Flame. These all, a Thousand Years first roll'd along, The God selects, and summons from the Throng To Lethe's Flood, that, all the former Lot Of mortal Life in needful Draughts forgot, Again to Bodies, and to upper Air, They may content and willingly repair. The Passage in the eighth Book of Virgil, where Venus prevails with her Husband Vulcan to make Arms for her Son Æneas (Beginning at v. 369.) Nox ruit, &amp; fuscis Tellurem amplectitur alis. Night hasts, and hov'ring gloomy over all, With dusky Wings involves the shaded Ball; When Venus mov'd, (nor vain were her Alarms) With threatning Dangers from Laurentian Arms, And gath'ring Nations, who, in Hate of Peace, Rose all tumultuous 'gainst her Trojan Race, Thus in his golden Bedchamber of State Vulcan bespeaks, sollicitous of Fate; With soothing Flattery thus begins to move, Whilst ev'ry Word breath'd forth diviner Love. While Grecian Kings laid waste Dardanian Tow'rs Ow'd to Destruction, and by hostile Pow'rs Condemn'd to fall, the Wretches left to Fate No Aid did I, no sacred Arms intreat, Nor would I vainly, against Heav'ns Decree, Tho' hard, employ thy dearer Art, and thee. And yet (but that I still preferr'd thy Peace) Much, much I ow'd to Priam's generous Race, And much for poor Æneas was concern'd, And oft his hard unequal Labours mourn'd. Now by imperial Jove's supreme Command He comes obsequious to th' Ausonian Land. Now therefore to thy lov'd Divinity (Thine ever sacred above all to me) I come a Suppliant, and a pious Boon Of Arms request, a Mother for a Son. Aurora thee, thee Thetis could engage, Won by their Tears. See the conspiring Rage; Their rigid Gates how the stern Cities bar, And whet the Sword for the relentless War; Whil'st all around confederate Nations join, Mad against me, and to the Fate of mine. She said, and, as he yet delay'd to grant (Half won, and half unwilling to consent) Round him she threw her snowy waxen Arms, A soft Embrace; but then he felt Alarms; The springing Heat, the well-known Flame began, And through the wasting Bones, and melting Marrow ran. As from prest Clouds when breaking Lightning flies, A fiery Flash, and gleams along the Skies. The crafty Wife, well-conscious of her Charms, Perceiv'd th' Effect of her prevailing Arms, Saw him all languishing, and inward smil'd, Pleas'd with her Arts to find the God beguil'd; When bound in Fetters of eternal Love Thus he reply'd. Why dost thou idly move These labour'd Causes? Goddess, why, unjust, Reposest thou in me so mean a Trust? Then when Troy was, and while yet Priam reign'd, This had'st thou ask'd, this thou had'st then obtain'd. 'Twas not deny'd; nor Jove, nor rigid Fate, Tho' they decreed the Fall, assign'd the Date; But ten Years more it might have been repriev'd, The Town have stood, and the good King have liv'd. And now, if now for Battle thou prepare, If 'tis thy Mind, and thou art bent to War, Whate'er my Art can give to thy Desire, What Metals can, or Force, or Air, or Fire, Is gladly thine; sollicite me no more, Nor with a needless Pray'r suspect thy Pow'r. Thus having said, and eager to caress, He sought her Arms, and gave a wish'd Embrace, And, all infus'd into her sacred Breast, Laid his fir'd amorous Limbs to grateful Rest. Upon the dead Bodies left undisposed of upon the Field of Battel at Pharsalia. Lucan, B. 7. v. 809. ?Tabesve Cadavera solvat An Rogus, haud refert. Whether unclean Decay, or decent Flame Dissolves the lifeless Carcass of our Frame, 'Tis all a Case, kind Nature, when we fall, In her good easy Lap receives us all; And Bodies, needless of a pitying Friend, Owe to themselves their independent End. These People too, if now 'tis not their Turn, Cæsar a future Fire shall one Day burn; With Earth shall burn, shall burn them with the Seas; For there's a Fate and Flame for very these. One common Fun'ral does the World attend, Which Stars above with Bones below shall blend. Wherever Fate thy Spirit shall bestow, Thither do theirs without Distinction go. Not thine shall more sublimely mount the Sky; Not thine in Shades beneath more nobly ly. Death is exempt from Fortune; Parent Earth Finds all a Room to whom she gave a Birth; And he, whose Dust no honest Urn contains, Has yet a Heav'n to cover his Remains. Cato's Speech to Labienus, when desired by him to consult the Oracle of Jupiter Ammon. Lucan, B. 5. v. 566. Quid quæri, Labiene, jubes? What is it thou proposest to enquire? Whether in Arms with Liberty entire I'd chuse to die, rather than meanly see The Triumphs of prevailing Monarchy? If Life is Nothing, and to Age possest Is but a longer Nothing at the best? If any Violence the good Man can harm, Whom Wisdom, Fortitude, and Justice arm, Or Fortune 'gainst opposing Virtue set Loses her Malice, and does vainly threat? If 'tis enough to aim at worthy Things, And to the Success just Nothing brings? All this persuaded of we knew before; Nor can the God himself implant it more. Then for the Rest, fix'd to the Pow'rs above, By Laws of Fate dependently we move. The Temple silent, w're directed still, And nothing do but with the Godhead's Will. Nor need there Words, nor is a Voice requir'd; But Reason given, and its Share inspir'd, Once at our Birth he did our Business show, And told us all that we have Leave to know: Nor barren Sands to teach a Few has chose Nor in this Wast does buried Truth inclose. Is there a Seat to be to God assign'd, But Heav'n, and Earth, and a brave virtuous Mind? Why seek we Deities elsewhere? 'Tis Jove All that you see, and wheresoe'er you move. Let doubting Minds in Pain for Things to come Want fortune-telling Priests to cant their Doom; Me 'tis not Oracles that satisfy, But Death, and Death's apparent Certainty. One Lot of Fate determin'd for us all, Alike the Brave, and Coward, are to fall. This is enough if you regard it well, For Man to know, or for the God to tell. Horace, Book I. ODE XI. In the Year 1685. I Forbear, my Friend, forbear ('tis Sin) t'enquire What mine shall be, or what thy End; Seek not the promising Astrologer, Nor on his Stars and Schemes depend. Our Fate is fix'd; let it be private too, What we can't change, why should we strive to know? II Whether the Gods shall think it fit or not More Years of Life than this t' allow, Take you no Thought; you'll better bear the Lot, Which unexpected you receive. Good Fortune by Surprize does greater show, And ill none sure wou'd covet to foreknow. III Drink Man, nor let extended Hopes outrun Poor Human Life's contracted Space. Lo, while we speak, malicious Time is gone; Catch, use the Minutes as they pass. Futurity's a cheating Lottery. Who'd on the false uncertain Chance rely? Another Version of the same Ode. This Ode is so far obscure, that one cannot be certain of having found Horace's exact and entire Meaning. The ut melius quicquid erit pati, from whence the Doubts arise, has sufficiently exercised and divided the Interpreters. To omit several Conjectures, which I think deserve to be rejected at first Sight, the old Commentators Porphyrio and Acron would have possis understood, and constru'd with pati Some (which tends to the same Sense) joyn pati with sapias, throwing all that is between into a pretty long Parenthesis. So is the Paris Edition, 1642. and so is that of Minellius, from which I made my first Translation. This Expedient is Grammatical enough, and the only Ambiguity either this or the other leaves is, whether ut melius, &amp;c. shall refer to what precedes concerning the Enquiry of the Length or Shortness of Life, or to what follows touching the Enjoyment of it, viz. Vina liques, and Spatio brevi, &amp;c. But yet against both it may be objected, that it had been so easy to have put feras instead of pati (which would have prevented all Hesitation, and expressed the very same Sense in a properer as well as easier Manner) that from thence alone one would suspect that the Poet had some other Meaning, and not that which might have been determined by a Word so obvious, that he could hardly have overlooked it. Supposing therefore that we have the Ode perfect as he wrote it, (and I hear of no various Reading here, but only of different Punctuation) perhaps, after all, the best Construction may be to connect sapias only with ut melius, and to joyn (tho' to the lengthning the Parenthesis) quicquid erit pati together; as thus, ut melius sapias quicquid erit pati (i.e. patiendum) &amp;c. According to this Method I have formed my second Version, tho' not neglecting the other Sense. For I make no Difficulty, where there are several Interpretations of any Passage, to take in both of them; since there may be two very good Senses sometimes of an Author, though, with all deference to some Sort of Commentators, I think there can be but one true and original one. In the Year 1722. I Be not inquisitive, mistaken Friend, Nor Astrologick Figures try, To learn what End does thee or me attend, Or when, or how we are to die. 'Tis past; the Thing is never to be known, And, if it were, were better let alone. II Whether good Heav'n intends us further Years, Or this is to conclude the Sum, That you may wiser be, and, free from Fears, May better bear the Lot to come, Mind what we have, decant the joyful Wine, And nothing out of your own Reach design. III Measure Things right, and from a scanty Space Cut off long Hope as out of Size. Consider Life as a soon finish'd Race; See, while we speak, it envious flies. Crop off each present Day the springing Flow'r, Trusting the Future, no, not for an Hour. ODE XIII. I When happy Strephon's too prevailing Charms, His rosy Neck, and his soft waxen Arms, Inhuman Lydia wantonly you praise, How cruelly my jealous Spleen you raise! Anger boils up in my hot lab'ring Breast, Not to be hid, and less to be supprest, II Then 'twixt the Rage, the Fondness, and the Shame, Nor Speech, nor Thoughts, nor Looks remain the same. Fickle as my Mind my various Colour shows, And with my Tide of Passion ebbs and flows: Tears stealing fall distill'd by soft Desire, To shew the melting Slowness of the Fire. III Ah! when I see that livid Neck betray The drunken Youth's too rudely wanton Play; When on those passive Lips the Marks I find Of frantick biting Kisses left behind; I rave to think these cruel Tokens show Things I cannot mistake, and would not know. IV How fond's the Hope, how foolish, and how vain, Of lasting Love from the ungentle Swain! Who that soft Lip so roughly can invade, Hurting with cruel Joy the tender Maid. Soon are they glutted who so fierce devour; They suck the Nectar, and throw by the Flow'r. V But, oh! thrice happy they that equal move In an unbroken Yoke of faithful Love! Whom no Complaint, no Strife, no Jealousy Sets from their gentle, grateful Bondage free; But still they dear fast mutual Slaves remain, Till unkind Death breaks the unwilling Chain. ODE XXIII. When, Cloe, by your Slave pursu'd, Why should you flie so fast? So the stray'd Fawn i'th' pathless Wood To her lost Dam makes Hast. Each Noise alarms, and all Things add New Terror to her Care; She starts at every dancing Shade, Each Breath of singing Air. With every Leaf, each Bush that shakes Throughout the murm'ring Grove, Her sympathetick Heart partakes; She trembles as they move. Fond Maid, unlike the Wolf and Boar, I hunt not to destroy; My utmost Prey wou'd be no more Than you might give with Joy. Urg'd on by soft and gentle Love I harmlessly pursue; Your Flight to me may cruel prove, But not my Chase to you. Cease idle Dreams of fancied Harms, Too childish Fears trapans; Leave running to thy Mother's Arms Who now art fit for Man's. ODE XXIV. In the Year 1721. Occasion'd by the Death of Walter Moyle, Esq; What Shame, what Moderation here Should Grief confine? What can appear Excess in all that we can show For one we lov'd, we valu'd so? Melpomene, dear plaintive Muse, Thou know'st the Notes which we shou'd use; To thee the Voice, the Lute belongs; Command, inspire our tuneful Songs. Does then perpetual Sleep oppress This Life, and Spirit of our Race? Whose Equal when will Learning find, And Wit and Sense and Candour joyn'd? By Crouds to be lamented, he Is fall'n, but more by none than me. With pious Zeal, but vain Desire, I of the Gods my Moyle require; Alas! not lent us to remain, Not took to be restor'd again. No, could I Orphean Musick bring, Or sweeter touch the tuneful String Which Trees could move, and Floods cou'd charm, Yet never, never may the warm, The vital Blood be reconvey'd To the pale Ghost, the empty Shade, Which once th' inexorable God, Driving with his tremendous Rod, Does to that gloomy Fold translate, Where all is Night, and all is Fate. 'Tis hard; but Patience, our best Friend, Lightens those Ills we cannot mend. Book II. ODE III. I. O Delius, mindful of thy mortal Frame, Calm, and with Temper play Life's various Game, And whate'er Fortune is, be ever thou the same. Nor in hard Times, and by the ruder Frown Dispirited, and cast desponding down; Nor by false Smiles and Blandishments decoy'd, Giddy with Joy, or insolent with Pride; But just, and steady, and no way inclin'd, In a wise Equilibrium keep thy easy Mind. Why shou'dst thou triumph here, or languish there? 'Tis but a while thou canst rejoice or bear. Fortune soon chang'd another Pitch may fly; But shou'd not Fortune change, yet thou art sure to die. II. Die, die thou must, whether in Care and Strife Thou lead'st an anxious gloomy Life, Or wisely, to thy self a better Friend, Thou good Occasions tak'st thy Labours to unbend; When in some silent, green Recess, Reclin'd upon the flow'ry Plain, With th' inmost Vault's select Champaign, Thou dost thy happy self caress; There, where the Poplar, and the Pine, Their social Branches amicably joyn, Repell the Sun that wou'd invade, And love to weave a hospitable Shade; Whilst a fresh Stream check'd in its winding Way, Lab'ring to vanquish the unkind Delay, Glides trembling by with a soft murmuring Noise, To hush thy peaceful Mind, and lull the gentle Joys. III. Here, here, to this divine Retreat, Bring all that's pleasing, all that's sweet; The Wines, the Essences, the rosy Flow'rs, To furnish out luxurious Hours; Whilst Age, and Fate, and Fortune all combine To give thee Leave, enjoy them while they're thine. For, oh! my Friend, the Time is short, And thou from all must surely part; Part from thy House, thy Groves, thy Villa which the Thames Washes so kindly with delightful Streams; And all thy high-pil'd Wealth shall be the Share Of thy then happy, thy succeeding Heir. IV. Whether thou wanton'st in abounding Store, Or begg'st, a Wretch, from Door to Door, Th' expanded Heav'n thy bleaky Canopy, A naked vagrant Tenant of the Sky; Whether from ancient Stock, and Blood of Kings, Thy high illustrious Lineage springs, Or thy low despicable Birth and Name From the vile Dregs and Refuse of the Rabble came, 'Tis to th' Affair of Dying all the same; Alike thou must resign thy common Breath; Alike the certain Victim of unpitying Death. V. All, all are bound to the same gloomy Shore, Only some follow after, and some go before, Fate shakes for all a common Urn, And soon or late our Lot must take its Turn. Then sentenc'd shall we from this dear-lov'd Country go, Transported to the wild Plantations down below; There into everlasting Banishment be hurl'd, Cast out from Life, and Exiles of the World. ODE XI. Done first 1686; alter'd to suit the Summer 1689. [I.] Do not, my Friend, a private Man, amuse Thy self with Politicks, Intrigues, and News. What is't to us what Duras or Lorrain Threaten, or promise this Campaign? What th' Irish plot, or martial French debate In their Consults of War, or their Cabals of State! Prithee let them and their Affairs alone, We all have enough Bus'ness of our own. Safe by objected Seas from present Fear, Why shou'd we bring such distant Dangers near? [II.] Why shou'd'st thou be abroad inquisitive? Mind thy Concerns at home, and wisely learn to live. Ev'n for thy self do not too studious be; Be not a Slave to very Thee; Nor anxiously for what's to come provide; Life fleets, and is with little satisfy'd. Beauty and Youth, with all it has of gay, Go backward, and pass light away; Soon lost behind, and to be found no more, Leaving bad heavy Days in View before. Age comes (a Prospect worthy of our Fears) The sapless hoary Winter of our Years; Dries up the genial Springs of Love, Does the sweet Dew of kindly Sleep remove; Age, that unsociable cruel Guest, That robs us of our active Joys, and our unactive Rest. III. Nor is it only in frail Human-kind That these Vicissitudes we find. Look on the Flow'rs of the young Year, That smell so sweet, so gay appear, How short a Pride do they enjoy! Their Glories first, and then They die. The Moon that shines at Full so bright, Not always wears one Countenance of Light; Her Face has too its Season of Decay, When every Night brings her less Day, Till the last poor Remains to perfect Shade give way. When every thing in Nature shifts so fast, Shou'd thy Solicitudes the same for ever last? Reason's short Line can never sound the Sea Of bottomless Futurity; Wrapt in dark Night Eternal Counsels ly, Where our dim Sight just Nothing can descry. Why shou'd we then so shallow, and so blind, Usurp a Province not for us design'd, And with unequal Cares oppress a tiny Mind? IV. Why rather in the secret Grove, Where we may Nature's present Bounties prove, Under some shelt'ring Tree's obliging Shade, On soft reposing Grass supinely laid, With fragrant rosy Garlands crown'd, Costly Perfumes casting rich Scents around, Whilst Heav'n permits, and we secure Have Life, and Health, and Pleasure in our Pow'r, Laughing at Fools that on to Morrow think, Don't we to Day discreetly careless drink? Life without this too slowly wou'd decay; Time itself's tedious not thus pass'd away. V. Wine's the best Lethe of our Care, As sure a Cure as Death, but sweeter far. When Bacchus comes, all Troubles Rev'rence yield, Dispers'd by the dread Conqu'ror humbly quit the Field; No more the Life of Life, and very Life devour; True Beasts of Prey, that fly from a bright Hour. Come then, about with it apace, Push on the friendly, warm, enliv'ning Glass. Here, Boy, here quickly some refreshing Ice, To render yet the Luxury more nice, The flaming Wine's fierce Ardor to restrain, Make it more flattering to the Tast, more harmless to the Brain. VI. And now but one Thing more: Wou'd my dear Lyde too were here. Who shall persuade the humorous Whore? Tell her we now can no Denial bear. Bid her (for full Delight is our Pursuit) Bring with her lovely Self her charming Lute, Touch'd by her Hand 'twill gentle Thoughts inspire, And raise our Harmony of Pleasure high'r. Let her not formally and idly stay For the dull State of a set solemn Dress; Bid her come artlessly adorn'd away, With a becoming Negligence, t' express A free and airy Wantonness: Quick let her come to meet our eager Fires, Gay as our Humours, loose as our Desires, Thus, Friend, we wisely might our Time improve, Thus, thus, in Drink, and Jollity, and Love. ODE XII. I. Urge me no more to write of martial Things, Of fighting Heroes, and of conqu'ring Kings: Our brave Fore-fathers Glory to advance, Shew subdu'd Ireland, and sing vanquish'd France, Tell how Spain's Blood the British Ocean swell'd, With Shame invading, and with more repell'd. No, these high Themes of the Heroic Strain, Suit ill with my low feeble Vein. To equal Numbers I'd in vain aspire; How should I make a Trumpet of a Lyre? Much less dare I in an unhallow'd Strain, Great Nassau's Wars, and Victories profane. You better may in lasting Prose rehearse Things which defy my humble Verse. 'Tis a fond Thing to think to reconcile Such glorious Actions with so mean a Stile. II. Me fair Lycinnia's softer Praise, Her native Charms and winning Ways, The Muse ordain'd to sing in gentle Lays: Me the sweet Song which Sirens Art defies, Me the serenely shining Eyes; And above all the grateful generous Heart, True to the mutual Love, and faithful to its Part. Lycinnia, whose becoming Dance, With airy Motion does Love's Fire advance; Whose wanton Wit, wild as her Eyes, The tickled Mind does pleasantly surprize; Whose various Arts all our loose Pow'rs alarm; A Grace each Action, and each Word's a Charm. III. Ah! when her willing Head she gently bends, And fragrant Kisses languishingly lends; When with fond artful Coyness she denies, More glad to lose, than we to win the Prize; Or when the Wanton in a toying Vein Snatches the Kiss from the prevented Swain; Wou'd you then give one Bracelet of her Hair For the poor Crowns that Monarchs wear? Wou'd you exchange, for all those fav'rite Isles The Sun laughs on, one of her pleasing Smiles? Wou'd you for both the Indies Wealth decline The hidden Pleasures of her richer Mine? Not I; for such vain Toys I'd ne'er remove; My Wealth, my Pomp, my Heav'n shou'd all be Love. Book III. ODE XIV. Upon His Majesty's Return from the Campaign in Ireland. I See, England, see thy mighty Nassau's come, The Belgick Hercules, victorious home; From vanquish'd Foes has Bays and Triumphs brought, With bravely ventur'd Death, and glorious Hazards sought. II Let fair Maria to the Temple move, And pay due Thanks to the just Powr's above; Let Anna join, nor fail a Heav'n to bless, That gave a Brother Safety, and a King Success. III Let joyful Mothers double Praise afford, For Sons preserv'd, and for a Prince restor'd; Let all the Young, and all the Fair assist, Nor Wife, nor blooming Maid be in the Consort mist. IV Let every Tongue, and every Heart With universal Gladness bear a Part; Let none repine, let none complain, Nor with an ill-tim'd Grief the sacred Joy profane. V To me the Day a perfect Jubilee, From every Care my Mind shall free; Nor Violence now, nor Tumult will I fear, While Nassau sits at Helm, and does the Empire steer. VI Where is the Essence, where are the Perfumes, To scent my Hair, and scent my Rooms? With pious Pomp, and decent Luxury, I'll celebrate the well-observ'd Solemnity. VII Let me have Wine, rich generous Wine, Worthy a Day so great, and so divine, A Virgin Cask of old untasted Juice, By Heav'n preserv'd, and kept for this peculiar Use. VIII Then to compleat and finish the Delight, Bid wanton Celia come, and bless the Night; With kind Hast bid her hither move To heighten Joys of Wine with Joys of Love. IX If her damn'd Maid thy Entrance stay, If she deny, if she delay, Ne'er importune, nor urge the Bus'ness on, But come away, and leave th' ill-natut'd Jilt alone. X Time was, when I should not have tamely born So proud a Slight, and rude a Scorn; When vigorous Youth with generous Fire, For every base Affront did brave Revenge inspire. XI But oh! those Days are done; my hoary Hairs Shew I am past, am past the Wars: Too frozen, and too gentle, Age Has cool'd my Love, and calm'd my Rage. ODE XXIV. I. Though all the Treasures and the Wealth were thine, Of the Arabian Soil, and Indian Mine; The Wealth of Guinea too, and of Peru, Of the Old World and of the New; Though thou had'st Palaces of more Excess Than ever Priest did raise, or King possess; Yet when once cruel Fate invades, To snatch the Slave to the dark Stygian Shades, All thy Efforts will be in vain To free thee from strong Death's tyrannick Chain. That Foe thou may'st not brave; Not all thy Opulence one Hour can save Thy Body from th' avoidless Grave; Or prove at Need so seasonably kind To drive one Fear, one Scruple from thy Mind. II. Why then (if so with the poor Rich it be, If what so much we seek no more can give;) Better, for ought I see, Did the Campaigning Scythians live: Those free Philosophers, whom rude we barbarous call; Who with themselves carry'd about their All; Did so the Prison of a Seat contemn, A Cottage was too much a Court for them, In rolling Carrs did trav'lling Houses drive; Better those Vagabonds (who would for nothing strive) Better the rigid Getes did their Affairs contrive: Where the undistinguish'd Field, To the Community impartial Fruits did yield; Where nothing of a Culture did appear, That look'd beyond the Prospect of a Year. Longer did no one's Share of Labour last; The annual Province fairly past, A fresh Set undertook the Soil, And on like Terms reliev'd their Predecessors Toil. Howe'er our seldes we value, and talk high Of our Improvements and Civility, And make to frivolous Arts a vain Pretence; Who live the nearest Nature, live the nearest Innocence. III. No Step-dame there employ'd her Care, To poison or supplant a former Heir; No Wife presuming on her Dow'r Usurp'd the Man's despotick Pow'r, Or to the plain coarse Husband did prefer A glitt'ring gay Adulterer. 'Twas amply there enough to be Descended of an honest Family; No Portions there were known, But their good Parents Virtue, and their own, That strict inviolable Chastity, Which there 'twas Sin to break, and where they for the Sin must dy. IV. What generous Prince to build a lovely Name, And on his Country's Good erect his Fame, Wou'd our destructive Factions tame? Our civil Fury wou'd reclaim? If in the noble Statue he would stand Confess'd the Father of the Land; Let him our ancient Continence restore, The frugal Manners of good Times before; With a stiff and steady Rein Let him courageously restrain The hard-mouth'd Licence of our Times, And all the Boldness of our private Crimes. How thus, how wou'd he be Bless'd and ador'd by just Posterity! Though we, I doubt, who were to feel the Cure, Shou'd the Physician ill endure. Such is our Envy, Fickleness, and Fate, That present Worth we ever hate, Vainly when gone admire, and wish for it too late. V. But what, alas! avails it to complain? The Sword of Justice must the Ill restrain. What are good Laws without agreeing Lives? If Government remissly at the Breach connives? If nor th' Inclosure of the Torrid Zone, With all the Threatnings of a Tyrant Sun; Nor the wild utmost Northern Coast, With solid Snow, forbidding Frost, If no Extreams of Heat and Cold The res'lute Merchant can one Jot with-hold, From the bold Chase of his beloved Gold? If skilful in the pathless Ways to Gain, The Mariner mocks all the Horrors of the Main. VI. O Poverty! thou grand Reproach, How dost thou native Innocence debauch! What will not Man act or endure, To be from despicable Thee secure! On thy Account we scrupulous Vertue fly; Her Road's too difficult, and to loath'd Thee too nigh. VII. To Paul's, or some such noble End, Where Glory may slow Zeal promote, Where loud Applauses shall attend, Let's our superfluous Wealth devote. Or else into our neighb'ring Sea, (The Sea as greedy ev'n as we) Let's hurl our needless Gold, our Jewels, and our Plate, Those fatal Springs of Mischief and Debate. If our past Crimes sincerely we repent, And really wou'd the like prevent, We must root out the very Seeds of Vice, The El'ments of pernicious Avarice, Whence all those Crimes arise. Must fashion well our softer Minds, By hardning and severer Disciplines; Such as those Stores shall make us little need, Which go devouring Luxury to feed. VIII. Our lazy Youth, our tender Race, In manly Arts unskill'd, Declining from brave Ancestors apace, Neglect the nobler Pastimes of the Field. A Ball's their roughest Exercise, Learned to play the Cards, and cast the Dice, Learned in all th' inglorious Mysteries Of feeble Vanity and Vice. Yet for such worthless Sons as these Do wretched Fathers shipwreck more than Ease; By broken Faith and perjur'd Vows, And every Way that no good Man allows, Hasten the Growth of an Estate That is to give to very Lightness Weight; Nor bosom Friend, nor Host, nor Partner spare, To build a Family, and make an Heir. A thousand Articles of Gain invent, To purchase ill what must as ill be spent. Thus vicious Riches still increase, And yet, howe'er it comes to pass, Ne'er so immense the too contracted Store, Such is Man's boundless Wish, wants some Addition more. ODE XXV. To Bacchus. In the Year 1690. [I.] O Bacchus, whither dost thou hurry me, Full, full of thy Divinity and Thee? Into what Caves, into what Bow'rs, Inform'd with a new Soul, and quick, exalted Pow'rs, With swift Confusion am I hurl'd, And rapt, and spirited about the World? In what divine Recess shall I be heard of Fame, Striving to eternize illustrious Nassau's Name? Rais'd to the Spheres in never-dying Odes, T'insert it 'mongst the Stars, and place it with the Gods? II. All shall be Miracle I sing, I'll write some new, some great, some unexampled Thing, Something above all Pattern, more Than Mankind ever said, or ever thought before. Such was th' Amazement, such the Fire, Which the mad Evias did on Thracian Hills inspire; When Rhodope's sacred Mount, and Heber's conscious Flood, Appearing to her View stirr'd the Lymphatick Mood; While th' infus'd God did all her Pow'rs engage, Quite senseless with the Trance, and sleepless with the Rage. Oh the Delight! when wing'd with Extacy Through unknown pathless Tracts I devious fly! How wondring, and how pleas'd, as the wild Fancy roves, To view the desart Rocks, and unfrequented Groves! III. O Bacchus, thou almighty generous Pow'r, By whose kind Aid all those who thee adore, While thy brave Heat does their strong Spirits warm, Things above weak dull Nature can perform, There's nothing low shall issue, nothing mean, Nothing mortal from my Pen. Thou Captain and Conducter of my Flight, In daring Strains I'll soar to a superiour Height, Whate'er, whate'er the Danger be, 'Tis sweet, 'tis sweet, great God, to follow thee. ODE XXVIII. Upon some Festival Day in the Time of King William and Queen Mary. I What shou'd I do on such a Day, But drink the flying Hours away? Lyde, to serve the just Design, Bravely produce the secret Wine, And force, while we our Glasses wield, Wisdom in all its Strengths to yield. II Dost thou not see the Noon decline? Yet still, yet still there is no Wine; As if fleet Time wou'd idly stay, And wait upon thy dull Delay. Where are the Flasks that yet detain The Juice that knew gay Charles's Reign? III Come, we will sing, alternate sing, Our Queen divine, and Godlike King; Him the great Neptune of our Floods, Her the bright Cynthia of our Woods; For whom thy Voice, thy Hand, thy Lute, Shall all their Art, and Musick suit. IV At last a sweet concluding Song To gentle Venus shall belong; Venus ador'd on Paphian Ground; Venus ador'd the World around; Nor shall her Friend and Fav'rite Night Fail of a Strain to do her Right. Book IV. ODE V. Inscribed to the King in Ireland, in the Year 1690. I Of Godlike Race, born with auspicious Fate, Best generous Guardian of our British State, Return; too long a hostile Land Has wrong'd our Happiness, and Thee detain'd. Kind to the Hopes you gave, O hasten home, And to thy wanting Court, and waiting Senate come. II Restore Thy Nation its divinest Light, The Lustre of Thy Presence, and Thy Sight; When thy propitious Beams upon us smile, 'Tis Spring throughout the happy Isle; The gladsome Day flies pleasanter away, And the serener Sun shines with a better Ray. III As, when beyond ungrateful Seas The absent Youth th' expected Time o'er-stays, With anxious Love, and tender Moan, Sighs a griev'd Mother for a darling Son; With Vows, and Pray'rs, his Coming she implores, And watches still the Winds, and still looks tow'rds the Shores: IV Such, sacred Monarch, is for Thee Our Pain, our Passion, and our Piety; Such, so impatient our Concern, So languish we, and die for Thy Return; Thy Britain thus stung with like fond Desire, Does for her Nassau long, her Cæsar does require? V And all but just; Great Prince, through Thee, Our convoy'd Fleets enjoy a peaceful Sea; Secure our Flocks possess their Plains; In fertile Fields auspicious Plenty reigns; Faith strict and nice, with generous honest Shame, Flies a reproachful Guilt, and fears a conscious Blame. VI No more shall Vice licentious reign, No more loose Loves chast Families shall stain; The Mother now shall boast a lawful Race, Shew all the Husband in the Infant's Face; Thy Zeal shall rouze long dormant Discipline, And Pain, and sure Disgrace shall close attend on Sin This has Reference to His Majesty's Letter to the Bishops concerning Discipline.. VII Who dreads the Turk, and dreads the Pope, While he has Nassau to secure his Hope? Who for rude Highland Rebels cares? For Gallick Force, or for Hibernian Wars? Of Armies, and of Fleets unmov'd we hear; From Danger thou secure, we are secure from Fear. VIII Under his Vine each sits in Peace, And sees on his Affairs the Noon decrease; Then, when the Morning Duty's past, Makes to a welcome Dinner chearful Hast, Enjoys his Cheer, while the glad Meal to crown, Sacred to Thee at last an honest Glass goes down. IX Thee we with Praise, Thee we with Wine Adore; Thee honour as a Thing Divine; Our better Genius Thee proclaim, And with our Guardian Angel's joyn thy Name; As her great Heroes grateful Greece of old, By Godlike Acts oblig'd, amongst the Gods enroll'd. X Long may'st Thou live, long may'st Thou reign, In Peace, and Glory these glad Realms maintain; This every, and This all the Day, With faithful Hearts thy People duly say. This is our Wish, and this our Care; Our drunken Ev'ning Health, our sober Morning Pray'r. Catullus. EPIG. XLIX. Mellitos Oculos tuos, &amp;c. Might I be allow'd to kiss Those dear Eyes, and to my Wish, I wou'd kiss them o'er and o'er, A thousand, thousand Times, and more. Nor wou'd this, all this suffice From such sweet delicious Eyes. But th' insatiate fond Desire, Longing, still wou'd more require, More, though still I shou'd go on, Kiss till Kisses thick were sown, And a larger Crop did yield Than the Harvest of the Field. EPIG. LXXXIII. Quinti, si tibi vis oculos debere Catullum. O Quintius, if a Joy 'twou'd be, To have me owe my Eyes to thee, Or any Thing that I could prize And love yet dearer than my Eyes; Rob me not of what is to me Far dearer than my Eyes can be, Or any Thing that I can prize And love yet dearer than my Eyes. EPIG. LXXXIV. Lesbia mî præsente viro mala plurima dicit. Lesbia before her Husband's Face Says all she can to my Disgrace; Despises, hates me, curses, rails, All that vex'd Woman never fails. This tickles the Fool's easy Ear, And he's o'er joy'd, as all were clear. Blind Mulus, thou dost nothing see; Did she not speak one Word of me, She might forget me, and be well: Now when she wishes me in Hell, And urges all this Obloquy, Not only she still thinks of me; But, what is worse for both of you, She thinks of me with Anger too; That is, (whatever she would shew) She loves me, and she tells thee so. EPIG. LXXXVII. Of Quintia and Lesbia. Quintia Fools a Beauty call; I call her fair, and strait, and tall. So I; for so far I allow; All this; Is she a Beauty now? No; for thus tall, and strait, and fair, Still she has nothing of an Air; Nothing that one can Taking call; Dull, aukward, and ungainly all; No Life, no Elegance, no Grace; An ugly Thing with a good Face. Lesbia, she's a Beauty, she; She who besides the Symmetry, The Charms of every well-form'd Part, Sets all off too with so much Art; With those Engagements, that Address, Such a bewitching Wantonness In the Motion, in the Mien, The Talk, the Look, the every Thing, That other Nymphs can be allow'd To charm but with th' unjudging Croud; In vain wou'd of Allurements boast By her to that Degree ingrost, To that unkind Excess that she Makes Beauty a Monopoly; While whate'er Charm the Sex endears All that is hers, and only hers. EPIG. XCII. Lesbia mî dicit semper male, &amp;c. Lesbia, is talking of me still, And still she rails, and still speaks ill; Not one good Word can she allow; Hang me! but Lesbia loves me now. For just, just thus by her I do; Yet hang me! but I love her too. Tibullus, Book IV. ELEG. IV. To Phœbus, as God of Physick. The Distich Nil opus est fletu, &amp;c. in the Edition from which I translated, and in the Variorum of 1659, is placed after that which begins Phœbe fave. But my Reason told me 'twas improper there. So I translated it, as if it had just preceded Phœbe fave, yet it might belong not to Phœbus (which would be absurd) but to the Lover (for whom doubtless it was designed) and coherently to Him. I since find that in the Cambridge Edition of 1702, qto. the Distich is removed indeed from the unfit Place where my other Editions had put it, but removed a Distich higher, than I thought needful; and placed between the Line which Ends salva puella tibi est, and that which begins At nunc tota tua est, where it is apt enough. By what Authority or Example the Editor has so fixed it, he has taken no Notice in his Various Readings, as if there were no Difference either in any Manuscript, or printed Copy about it. If he proceeded only by Conjecture, perhaps mine may be near as good as his. At least I have not thought it necessary to alter my Translation. Come, Phœbus, come (we supplicate thy Aid) And from rude Sickness free a tender Maid; Hast; tho' a God thou shalt not grudge this Care; A God may be Physician to the Fair. From her wan Limbs the pining Leanness chase, Nor let pale Looks her livid Form deface; And every Ill, and whatsoe'er we fear, Give to the Winds, and Seas, to bear from her. Come, and bring with thee all thy Med'c'nal Arms, Whatever helpful Drugs, or pow'rful Charms, Can give oppress'd, decaying Health Relief, Can ease a faint, and lab'ring Body's Grief. In Pity hast, nor torture thus a Swain, Who the Nymph's Fate well merits to sustain, And, through a Fondness which no Bound allows, For his dear Mistress makes unnumber'd Vows. Sometimes he vows, and fain wou'd Help engage, Sometimes repining with impatient Rage, To see her languish whom he so adores, He vents hard Things against th' eternal Pow'rs. Peace, Peace, fond Youth, thy Blasphemies forbear; Confide in Passion, and lay by thy Fear. To Lovers Heav'n will not injurious prove; Thy Nymph is safe, do thou but ever love; Well shall be thine, who, now too all thy own, In secret thinks of thee, and thee alone; Whilst unregarded Crouds but entertain False hopes, and slighted Duty pay in vain. There need no Tears; more Cause for them you'll find, If ever she shall to thee prove less kind. But thou, O Phœbus, lend an equal Ear; Favour an am'rous Suppliant's pious Pray'r. Will it not glorious be, and greatly done, To save two Lovers, in preserving One? Then, then thy Joy, thy Triumph, and thy Fame, When the glad Pair shall their due Thanks proclaim, Rival each other, vying, to thy Boast, Who most indebted shall return Thee most! Thee blest then all the Host of Heav'n shall stile, And every God with Envy wish thy Skill. Book IV. ELEG. XIII. Fame says, the Mistress of my Heart Faithless sins oft against her Part. Then do I wish I had no Ear, News, which I so much hate, to hear. Howe'er her Crimes the Tatlers feign, Feign'd as they are, they give me Pain. Why torture you a Wretch's Breast, Which, but for you, might be so blest? The cruel Talk in Pity cease, And leave my Love and me in Peace. Propertius, Book I. ELEG. IV. To Bassus. Why, Bassus, why with thy officious Care, To praise each Nymph, which thou mistak'st for fair, To wandring Loves wou'd'st thou my Heart betray? And from my Mistress spirit me away? Why canst not thou in Peace let me alone, In her dear well-known Service to go on? There unambitious and content to spend What Years of Life indulgent Heav'n shall lend. Vain Man! cou'd'st thou for Themes of juster Praise, A Læda, or a fairer Helen raise, Or whate'er Beauties, in the handsome Age, Did or the Heroes, or the Gods engage, My Cynthia yet triumphant o'er their Fame Wou'd shine, nor suffer them to have a Name; Much less wou'd fear, though partially compar'd, The Shadows e'er shou'd be to her preferr'd. Yet is this mighty Beauty but the least, The meanest Part of what affects my Breast. O Bassus, greater Things behind there ly, That make me willing and rejoice to die; An Air genteel, that nameless Charms imparts, The rare Accomplishments of num'rous Arts, And above all, which I delight to tell, Th' enchanting Pleasures which her Robes conceal; That still the more thou wou'd'st divide our Flame, With Faith confirm'd the more we mock thy Aim. O, Rogue, ne'er hope to 'scape unpunish'd so; The injur'd Nymph shall all thy Treason know. Poor Bassus, what will then become of thee? For she will prove no silent Enemy; No more shall me to thy false Care commit; Court thee no more, nor such a Crime forget; In every Visit shall her Wrongs declare, And curse and rail at thee to all the Fair, While thou shalt odious grow to every Maid, That hates thy Arts, and fears to be betray'd. The weeping Beauty shall to Heav'n appeal, At every Altar shall complaining kneel. No Loss so much does am'rous Cynthia move, No Loss so much as that of gentle Love; To have the Lover ravish'd from her Arms, And most of all shou'd I forsake her Charms. Oh, that she thus for ever may remain, That I still loving never may complain! Seneca's Hercules Furens. Act. I. Chorus. Few are the Lights we now in Heav'n can view; And ev'n those few are faint and dying too. The Night o'ercome recalls each wand'ring Star, And morning Lucifer brings up the Rear. The Constellation that ne'er knew the Sea, Turns but its Chariot, and calls up the Day, It comes, preceded by new azure Light. Phœbus now glances on the Mountain's Height, Now redden with his Beams the bushy Fields, And Place to him his flying Sister yields. Up rises Labour to its various Cares, Opens the Houses, to the Fields repairs. Shepherds their Flocks dismissing from the Fold, Gather Food hoary yet with frosty Cold. The Steerling plays free in the open Mead, With Front unfurnish'd, and a harmless Head. The emptied Dams their milky Stores regain, And wanton Kids range o'er the grassy Plain. Birds, in mix'd Notes, of Day the Welcome sing, And stretch to the new Sun a joyful Wing. Vent'rous of Life, the Mar'ner waits a Gale, And to the Winds commits the filling Sail. On rocky Shores the patient Angler waits, Refits his Hooks deluded of their Baits. Now pressing lifts the pon'drous Rod with Pains, Views with Suspence in Air his doubtful Gains; The quiv'ring Fish the lab'ring Bristles strains. These are th' Employments of a harmless Life, Calm and at Rest from Tempests and from Strife, Where a small House, with a few grateful Fields, A sweet Content to the glad Owner yields. Not such in Cities the wild Scene appears; There Hopes sollicitous, and anxious Fears Work like a Whirlwind, tossing up and down The busy Millions through the crouded Town. One sleepless haunts the Levees of the Great, And waits Admission at his Lordship's Gate, Hard to obtain, and to his Speech to get, Whether you want a Grace, or want a Debt. A Miser This, does Thrift and Gain intend, Rich to no purpose, carking without End, Adds Wealth to Wealth, and gaping still for more, Is ever heaping, and is ever poor. There pop'lar Fools transported grow and proud, With th' airy Favour of the wav'ring Croud: Here Pleaders in the clam'rous Hall engage Their venal Talk, and mercenary Rage. But few, ah! few, are they who know or strive To gain safe Quiet, and so really live; Who, from a Sense, how swift Time passes o'er, Possess in Passing what returns no more. Live joyful, live at Ease, while live you may, And Nature's Warnings take against Delay. With speedy Course Life hasts along its Race, And Days and Years with quick Rotation pass. The rigid Sisters with their Task go through, Nor backward turn the Wheel, nor what they spin undo. But blindly Men, as rapid and as fleet, As Fate advances, Fate advance to meet; Seek the infernal River of the Dead, And cut themselves their own unfinish'd Thread. Too much the Hero to an End does hast, Which of it self approaches but too fast. Our Fates in Order regularly come; The Urn receives us and allots our Doom. Commanded, none may loiter, or may stay, None may protract his once determin'd Day; Summon'd and sentenc'd we must all obey. Let others then Knight Errants turn for Fame, And Nations to the Stars exalt their Name; Let others in Triumphant Chariots ride, With gaudy Honours, and with empty Pride. Me my own Land, me may an humble Seat Hide in a safe and an obscure Retreat. On the soft Quiet of a settled State, Grey Hairs, and good old Age delight to wait, And, like a Cottage in its Vale secure, In Life the lowly Station most is sure. Magnan'mous Brav'ry, glorious that, in quest Of great Atchievements, never is at Rest, Conspicuous, high, expos'd to every Blast, Falls from aloft, and soon to Earth is cast. Seneca's Agamemnon. Act. I. Chorus. Fortune, thou grand Impostor, what a Cheat Is all that Good thou seem'st to give the Great? How steep the Height, how false on which they stand! And yet how few the Pleasures they command! Quiet's a Joy Scepters have never known, Nor can a Monarch call a Day his own. Care after Care still harrasses his Mind; One Storm blown o'er, another is behind. Not the wild Waters of the wandring Tide, Not troubled Waves toss'd by a Tempest's Pride, Are half such various, such unsteady Things, As are th' uneven Fates of restless Kings. Fear'd they wou'd be, and yet they wou'd not too, Wish what they dread, and doubt what they pursue. Not Night itself yields them a safe Retreat; Distrust and Danger still attend the Great. Ev'n Sleep, the gen'ral Refuge of all Cares, Calms not their Breasts, nor dissipates their Fears. What Thrones have not subverted, and cast down Th' alternate Crimes of Rivals for a Crown! What Kingdoms do not cruel Impious Arms Weary and waste with their destructive Harms! For Sense of Laws, of Justice, or of Shame, Rev'rence and Faith to Hymen's sacred Claim, With all Regard to any moral Ty, Excluded Courts, from every Palace fly. There stern Bellona haunts with bloody Hand, And Envy burning with a Fury's Brand: Sure Foll'wers these of Majesty and Pow'r, Which thus expos'd are level'd every Hour. But shou'd no Wars disturb the faithful Peace, Shou'd dark Designs, and secret Treasons cease; Yet Grandeur sinks depress'd by its own Weight; The Load's too heavy for the Strength of Fate. Thus when full Sails stretch with the prosp'rous Wind, We fear that Wind, because it is too kind. The Tow'rs whose Summits to the Clouds aspire, Are to the Lash of Rains and Tempests nigh'r; And old tall Oaks are riven by the Blast, Which o'er th' inferior Forest harmless past. The Thunder strikes the lofty Mountain still, Not the low Valley or the humbler Hill. Sickness the Overgrown does soonest seize, And the gross Body is its own Disease. The large fat Beast destructively is priz'd, While vile lean Herds graze safe, because despis'd. Tis thus, in every Thing 'tis thus, and all That Fortune raises is but rais'd to fall. The safest Seat is in the middle State; Lower the Lot, but longer is the Date. Happy then he, who, pleas'd with such a Chance, Seeks not too far his Fortunes to advance, Trusts not his Vessel to the faithless Deep, But near the Shore does more securely keep. Seneca's Troas. Act. II. Chorus. Is't true that Shades their Bodies do survive? Or does a Flam the tim'rous World deceive? When some dear Friend our dying Eyes has clos'd, And Life's last Day Death's endless Night impos'd; When the eas'd Corps, like an o'er-jaded Slave At length set free, lies quiet in the Grave; Were it not wise the Soul too to intomb? But must we still endure Life's wretched Doom? Or happier do we die entire and whole, Leave no continuing Relict of a Soul? But when the vital Vapour of our Breath, Gasp'd into Air, is lost in Clouds and Death, We're gone, and all that was of us before To any Thing of Life is then no more? Yes, thus we perish, and thus undergo Th' approaching Lot of all Things here below. Time flies, and all the Sea or Sun goes round With sure and quick Destruction shall confound. Swift, as above, the Stars, and Moon, and Sun, In hurrying Orbs their hasty Courses run, We post to Fate, and when we disappear, Are we, or ever shall be, any where. As short-liv'd Smoak, ascending from the Flame, Hovers, dissolves, and ne'er shall be again: As gath'red Clouds, by scatt'ring Blasts disjoin'd, Disperse, and fly before the hostile Wind: So that thin fleeting Thing, Life, passes o'er; So flows our Spirit out, and then's no more. After Death's Nothing; Death itself is Nought, Th' extremest Bound of a short Race of Thought. Let Slaves and Fools their Fears and Hopes give o'er, Sollicit and delude themselves no more. Wou'd you know where you shall be after Death? There where you were before you suck'd in Breath. The Dead and the unborn are just the same, The Dead returning whence the Living came. Time takes us whole, throws all into the Grave; Death will no more the Soul than Body save. For Hell, and the damn'd Fiend that lords it there, With all the Torments we so vainly fear, Are empty Rumours, melancholly Whims, Fantastick Notions, idle frightful Dreams. Out of Petronius Arbiter's Satyricon. Qualis Nox fuit illa Dii Deæq;! Gods! what a glorious, happy Night Was that! how all, how all Delight! How soft the conscious downy Bed That held the yet, yet softer Maid! Glew'd in the balmy hot Embrace, We clung at Breast, and clung at Face, Legs, Thighs, and every kinder Place. Clung, clung, 'till two we one became, Neal'd and incorp'rate by the Flame. What Eagerness of Love and Bliss! Our Souls transfusing in a Kiss, Which on our Lips did hov'ring stray, Then fled in Gasps of Love away. Be gone ye Cares, and from me fly; Let me alone to perish; I Thus have begun, thus learn'd to die. The latter Part of the second Satyr of Persius, Imitated. Beginning at this Verse, O curvæ in Terras Animæ &amp; Cœlestium Inanes! O souls bow'd down to Earth, whose Dirt you love, Void, and unknowing, of the Things above! What do we mean, (for grossly 'tis we err) Manners of Men to Temples to transfer, And, by this carnal vicious Tast of ours, Proportion Gifts for intellectual Pow'rs? Sweets we extract, and mix up fat Perfumes, To scent our Hair, our Garments, and our Rooms. The finest Wools for softest Clothes are shorn; Those softest Clothes the noblest Dyes adorn. Silks, Velvets, Tap'stries, added are to these, In Habits, or in Furniture to please. The Orient Shell for precious Pearl we sheer, A Neck to honour, or to grace an Ear; Refine the Oar of Gold and Silver Mines; In Lace, Embroid'ry, Fringes, Plate, it shines. All this is faulty, and a vain Abuse; Yet of the Vanity Man has some Use. But tell me, Priest, what can be the Design Of Gold and Finery in Things divine? The Treasures which your Foreign Churches load, The Wealth which you call giv'n or left to God, (If we inspect the superstitious Whim) What Good does it do us, or Service Him? E'en just as much as what we have been told Of foolish Heathen Virgins, that of old, Adult, to Venus offer'd up at last The Puppet Babies they themselves were past; As much as ancient Bel's exploded Treat, Which, useless to the God, his Priests knew how to eat. But, Man, present we to the heav'nly Pow'rs What Nobles can't, nor Kings, nor Emperors; Join'd and compounded rightly in the Mind, Aw of the Godhead, Morals to Mankind; An inward Sanctity, sincere and whole, In the remotest Corner of the Soul; A Warmth of Heart, rich with the gen'rous Dy Of something nobler than meer Honesty? These let me with me to the Temple bring, The Widow's Mite's a grateful Offering. These let me bring my God, and I may spare My Off'ring wholly, and almost my Pray'r. But, void of these, who wou'd with Tricks prevail, All they can say, or vow, or give, will fail. The latter Part of the tenth Satyr of Juvenal. No God is wanting to the Wise. Nullum Numen abest si sit Prudentia. So it is in the Edition from which I translated. In the Variorum by Schrevelius, 1658, it is Nullum Numen habes, &amp;c. And according to this Reading is Mr. Dryden's Version. But the other is the truer. The Meaning may be, that if Men were wise enough to wish and pray for such Things as he had before recommended for the Subject Matter of their Petitions, the Gods would not be absent from them but present to assist them. And this Sense is the most pious. But that which Juvenal really intended, is, that since Virtue is the Way to Happiness, and since Virtue, and the great Instances of it which he had directed to be asked of Heaven, were in our Power, if we had the Wisdom to make such a Choice, we had no need of any Gods at all, since thus we could give Happiness to our selves. But if we made Fortune a Goddess, if we plac'd our Felicity in her Goods, those indeed were not in her Disposal; we must resort to other Powers for them. This is said more philosophically than religiously. The Word, wanting to, (chose instead of, wanted by) answers either of the Senses. Beginning at the following Verse, Nil ergo optabunt Homines? [The Poet, in this excellent Satyr, having, by an Induction of Particulars, shewn the Vanity and Folly of the Generality of our Desires, in the Mischiefs which often attend the Attainment of them, subjoins to all this admirable Conclusion.] What Nothing then shall Man of Heav'n request? Wou'd'st thou advise? then set thy Soul at Rest, And unconcern'd remit the whole Affair To the wise Gods, and their unfailing Care. Let them alone in Quiet to contrive What fits our State, who then will surely give Things suited to our real Interest, Not send the pleasing, but bestow the best. Man is the Darling of the Pow'rs above, Who love us better than ourselves we love. Giddy, and rash, and by blind Passion led, Marriage we ask, and Offspring of the Bed. But They before know all the cursed Life, The Cares, the Disappointments, and the Strife, Th' ungrateful Child, and the vexatious Wife. Yet that thou still their Godheads may'st invoke, Still Altars may with holy Incense smoke, Go kneel, I give thee Leave, and ask conjoin'd A healthful Body, and a healthful Mind. Request a brave and an intrepid Soul, That may the wretched Fears of Death controll, Thankful for that which a fond World so frights, And count it one of Nature's Benefits; That Griefs and Torments can erect sustain, Uncharm'd by Pleasure, and unmov'd by Pain; That no Indignities can set on Fire, Estrang'd alike from Anger and Desire, And Nassau's Lot would generously prefer, His noble Toils, his Hardships, and his Care, As better and more valuable Things, Than all the Lux'ries of Assyrian Kings. Thus while thy wise Petitions I contrive, 'Tis all but what yourself yourself may give. Virtue's our own at Pleasure to possess; And Virtue is the Road to Happiness. No God is wanting to the Wise, but we, Fortune, are Fools, and make a Goddess Thee. Martial, Book I. EPIG. X. O Julius, who, (if to enhance a Friend Long Faith, and old Acquaintance may pretend) Art in this Breast to be postpon'd to none, How is with silent Steps thy Age come on! Thy Sixtieth Year just ready to arrive, And Life scarce left a few poor Days to live. And Life scarce left a few poor Days to live. The Latin which answers this is, Et numerat paucos jam tua vita Dies; which is ambiguous, and one Instance of a great many to shew that the Ancients did not take Care to express themselves so clearly but that they might be mistaken by those of their own Age. For here is no Difficulty, as to the Words and the Latinity, and yet, though the Person to whom the Epigram was address'd knew how he had employed his Time, and so might the better understand his Friend's Meaning, and so might others too who were acquainted with his Manner of Living, yet no one else cou'd ev'n then with Certainty. The Doubt is whether the Passage relates to the future part of Julius's Life, as I have interpreted it, or to that which was past, to intimate that in summing up the Accompt of his Days, there were very few, if any, that had lived to the Purpose, and in the Satisfaction which the Poet recommends. But I prefer the former Sense, because the Epigram seems to be a general Lesson against Procrastination, and intended to animate him, to and for whom it was writ, to be sure to enjoy the Remainder of his Life, from the Consideration how small that Remainder was like to be, rather than to contain a Censure of any Neglect in what had gone before, of which there appears no Hint in any other Part of the Composition. However, the Translation may with a very little Alteration be accomodated to the other Meaning, thus, Thy Sixtieth Year is just, is just arriv'd, And scarce thy Life a few good Days has liv'd. Hast then, and use the small remaining Tide; Ill 'twas deferr'd what might have been deny'd. For that alone which has been, reckon yours, The Future's Fate's, and may be never ours, &amp;c. Hast, Man, and use the small remaining Tide; 'Tis ill deferring what may be deny'd. Count that alone which has been, to be yours; The Future's Fate's, and may be never ours. Labours and Cares Life ever finds at Hand, Succeeding still, and to each other chain'd. Dull things they wait attending all the Way; But Pleasure's fugitive, and will not stay. Quick with both Arms, and with thy whole Embrace, Assert it thine, and seize it e'er it pass. Ev'n thus 'tis slipp'ry as the wandring Stream, Flows from the Breast, and oft deludes the Aim. And can we think, (or any Reason give,) Coldly to say, to Morrow we will live? Trust me, 'tis all an idle dull Delay; Will, and to Morrow's late; live now, to Day. This very Moment the good Work begin, Fools have the Purpose, the Wise do the Thing. Book VIII. EPIG. XIX. Lord, what can Cinna wish for more? Poor he wou'd seem, and he is poor. Book XI. EPIG. LVI. [This is by Martial address'd to an indiscreet Stoick. Had we here had any Fryars Mendicant, or any Regulars professing Poverty, I should have apply'd it to one of them. But for want of them (and it would not be worth the while to have them for the Convenience of such an Application) I have been oblig'd to suppose a poor Vicar or Curate, preaching or talking of the Advantages of Mortality against the Vanity of human Life. The Poverty is exaggerated, as perhaps it was in the Case of the Stoick. How far a Change of Circumstances might occasion an Alteration of Sentiments and Discourse, I will not determine. I doubt few People are fond of Dying, that can live with any of the Comforts of Life.] That thus in Scorn of slighted vital Breath, Thou talk'st with such Magnificence of Death, Parson, thou wou'dst have me so dully blind, Hence to admire thy Fortitude of Mind. Fool, wou'dst thou know what has thy Virtue bred? Th' unhandled Pitcher, and th' uncurtain'd Bed; The melancholly Hearth to Fire unknown; The short, the threadbare, and the single Gown; The homely Cottage, the more homely Fare; The full ten Children, scarce ten Pounds a Year. O Hero, that canst humbly be content To part from Rags, and Nastiness, and Want! What, from sour Beer with Patience to withdraw, From Bread half Bran, and from a Bed all Straw! Prodigious Resignation! wondrous Saint! But tell me, Priest, and leave thy splendid Cant, Wou'dst thou at Death, when 'twere injurious, smile? Wou'dst thou scorn Life, were Living worth the while? No; let a friendly Dean'ry, and a Brace Of Livings thee in Ease and Plenty place; To court thy wanton Sleeps let there be thrown A Quilt of Damask on a Bed of Down; Let well-spread Boards indulge thy flatter'd Tast, And thee be answer'd too in all the rest; Then thou wouldst change thy Text, and pity Man Not from the Toil of Living, but the Span; Then for thy Wish a Patriarch's Age too short, Not with one Friendly Moment wou'dst thou part. Now Life's a Load, and, wanting to be freed, Thou for thy Brav'ry wou'dst impose thy Need. Vain Coward, Proof of Courage wou'dst thou give? In thee 'tis Boldness, not to die, but live. Life to contemn is easy for a Slave; He, he who dares to be a Wretch is brave. The Beginning of Claudian's First Book in Rufinus. Oft have I doubted in my wav'ring Mind (All anxious for a Truth so hard to find) If of our World, and this inferior Sphere The Gods took Care, or there no Ruler were, But loosely all at Random left to flow, Blind Chance plaid an uncertain Game below. For when the marshall'd World I well survey'd, And all the Harmony of Nature weigh'd; The Sea prescrib'd an everlasting Bound, The Year revolving in a faithful Round, And Night and Day so just; then all I thought Was by diviner Skill and Counsel wrought, The noble Work of a wise Pow'r above, Who by a Law enjoin'd the Stars to move; Who bid the Moon, and bid the Sun be bright With borrow'd Lustre and with native Light; Who various Seasons for the Fruits ordain'd, Th' ambitious Waves with bounding Shores restrain'd, And midmost in the Centre fix'd of all Firm on its axis plac'd the earthy Ball. But when th' Affairs of wretched Human-kind So wild I saw, so puzzled, and so blind; Th' unjust of long Prosperity possess'd, And by prevailing Wrongs the Good oppress'd; Then poor Religion, forc'd again to yield, Gave way, and I, unwilling and compell'd, The Method of another Cause embrac'd, Which for a World depends upon a Waste, And Seeds of Things that course along the Void, While Chance, not Art, does the new Figures guide Dismissing Heav'n, and with ambiguous Sense No Gods asserting, or no Providence. At length th' unhappy and perplex'd Debate Is at an End; Rufinus and his Fate My Mind has eas'd (successful to remove Its Scruples) and absolv'd the Pow'rs above. No more repining will I now complain That Villains rise, and Pow'r exalted gain, Whom Heav'n in Vengeance does so high extoll But to give Weight and Terror to the Fall. Out of Buchanan's Hendeca-Syllabi. Seu procacibus annuas Ocellis, &amp;c. Whether Neœra frowns or smiles Her Vassal she alike ensnares; Th' inviting Look my Heart beguiles; My Courage the Forbidding braves. Sometimes a cred'lous Hope prevails; Then Fear again invades my Breast: As when the milder Southern Gales Are by rude Northern Blasts supprest. Darts she but an auspicious Beam, I gently warm with soft Desire; Fond Hope dilates the living Flame, And easy fans the flatter'd Fire. But oh! the Shiv'rings of my Heart, If sullen Frowns shew proud Disdain! Cold Numness seizes ev'ry Part, And trembling Ice runs through each Vein. Thus am I tost 'twixt Hopes and Fears, Driv'n by the doubtful Storm of Love; No Day, no Night exempt from Cares, Restless from Thought to Thought I rove. Ah merc'less Love! Ah cruel Boy! Thus ev'ry Way your Slave to kill! What Safety if you thus destroy Both using well, and using ill? Out of his Miscellanea. Upon Pope Julius the Second. Thy Father Genoese, thy Mother Greek, Born on the Seas, who Truth in thee would seek? False Greece, Liguria's false, and false the Sea; False all, and all their Falshoods are in thee. Upon Queen Elizabeth. Out of the second Book of his Epigrams. Amongst the Icones or Portraits. What Goddess this, in whose one Face divine, Jointly Minerva, Juno, Venus shine? A Goddess sure, in whom alike have Place High Majesty, Male Vigour, chearful Grace. If not a Goddess, at least next to one She is, who thus adorns her English Throne; Or not to carry Buchanan's Complement to its full height, more softly thus, On Earth resembles those that grace the Skies, So just, so good, so beauteous, and so wise.Equal on Earth to those that grace the Skies, As just, as good, as beauteous, and as wise. Another Canto of the same, (viz. Buchanan's Epigrams.) To Mr. Randolph, a Servant of the Queen's, and frequently employed in Scotland. Randolph, thou often dost my Thoughts require, Might I obtain the King I shou'd desire, What Person I wou'd have that King to be; Take then his genuine Portrait here from me. First pious, let him true Religion love; Himself the Image think of God above, Ordain'd to Men his Blessings to dispense, And do on Earth the Work of Providence. Peace let him cherish; yet not Arms abhor, When just Occasion calls to prudent War. Mild to the Vanquish'd, Peace again restor'd, Let him put off his Hatred with his Sword. Nor let him loosely give, nor closely spare; Destructive both, of each he shou'd beware. Let him believe, (a noble needful Thing) He for his People, not himself, is King; Design'd the common Father of his Land, And only for Protection to command. Loth let him punish, when he may not spare; Gentle, when Gentleness the State will bear. Let his own Life teach others to live well, And be his Nation's Pattern to excell; His Count'nance here rebuke, and there approve; The bad Man's Terror, and the good Man's Love. Rich let him dress his Mind, his Body plain, And Shame and Reason Luxury restrain. Now dost thou inward think, and silent say, What do you mean by this delusive Way? I ask what Prince you wou'd shou'd give you Law, And you the Picture of my Mistress draw. Dr. Bathurst's Verses on Mr. Hobbs's Book of Human Nature. The Mind, to whose enlarg'd prevailing Wit Whole intellectual Nature does submit, Which Earth, and Seas, and Heav'n too comprehends, And if ought else beyond all these extends, The World thus master'd gloriously at Home, Mistress at length is of herself become. Before she made all Knowledge else her own, Now first herself unto herself made known. Come, Reader, learn here what thou art, come see Thy inmost Pow'rs; acquaint thy self with Thee, View here the secret and mysterious Guest, The Tenant, yet the Stranger of thy Breast; Than which to thee there nothing is so near; Than which there nothing is from thee so far. Not here the Trash and Jargon of the Schools, The empty Pride of Academick Fools, Sev'n Years or more by fond Disputers read, To arm the Tongue, and furnish out the Head, That full they may come forth of Sound and Air, And utter with vain Cant their Pedling Ware. But Weight of Things, Solidity of Sense, Beauty of Thought, and Light of Evidence. Such shou'd have been the Features of the Piece, When Reason's self in human Form and Dress Was to be drawn, by Mortals to be view'd, And present to the Mind of her Asserter stood, In Pieces took here we are shewn the whole Clock-work and Mechanism of the Soul; May see the Movements, Labyrinths, and Strings, Its Wires, and Wheels, and Balances, and Springs; How 'tis wound up to its full Height, and then What checks, and stops, and settles it again. Momus himself cou'd not have more descry'd, Had he his Window to the Mind apply'd, (So clear the Images appear) than we In this true Philosophick Mirror see. Here the light Prints I find, and Rudiments Of Passion, here the small fine Lines of Sense; On downy Wings how the soft Cupids move To hatch the pregnant Images of Love; How Anger fierce urges and goads the Mind, To Counsel deaf, and to Discretion blind. Here in its close Recess is Grief descry'd, Joy here's reveal'd, nor Fear its self can hide. These useful Arts should the wise Pleader know, If in the Hall he wou'd Superior grow; Wou'd at his Will dispose and turn, and wind, Th' obedient Reins of the well-manag'd Mind; Biass a Court, and with magnetick Sense, Attract a captivated Audience. Here let the great State Archimedes fix, When by firm Engines of sure Politicks He'd urge an Empire, discompose a State, And stir fierce Nations up to fell Debate, And the Foundations in Confusion hurl'd, Shake the vast Frame of the whole civil World. All things besides he may with Ease controll, Who can command the Passions and the Soul. Daring Enquirer! Spirit that canst soar, And act the fam'd Promethean Part once more, What God these Glories has to thee reveal'd, To Ages hid, and from Mankind conceal'd? And tinging with Celestial Light thine Eyes, Giv'n thee to view these dazling Mysteries? No Bounds thy Searches and thy Wit confine, Capacious of all Minds, but None of thine. Let this thy never-fading Honour raise; Alone enjoy it as thy proper Praise. To form the Soul's a Work divine alone, And that is next by which that Soul is shown. Ovid, Book III. ELEGY VIII. Complaining of his being slighted in Favour of a rich Upstart. Ingenuous Arts does any one still chuse, Or dream of Virtue in a tender Muse? Wit has (divine and sacred heretofore) Been held more precious than the golden Ore. Now want of Money want of Sense is grown, And to be poor's to be a very Clown. Without Success my Lines my Fair one please, Whilst I'm debarr'd th' Access she grants to These. She praises, yet excludes th' applauded Man; Ingenious I rove up and down in vain. A brutal Upstart she to me prefers, Rais'd by his Wounds, and wealthy from the Wars. Fool; what with him in kind Embraces join? Bear his Caresses, and return him thine? Him the unbred, th' unfashion'd, unrefin'd, All coarse alike in Body and in Mind? If you forget, or if you do not know, What once he was whom now you favour so, The Head which on thy downy Lap may ly, The Limbs that serve thy Pleasures to supply, In Camps have lain on Arms or Knapsack rough, Been cas'd in Iron, or involv'd in Buff. The Hand where sparkling Rings so ill appear Has poiz'd the Musket, or sustain'd the Spear. And touch but t'other, that has been imbru'd In martial Butchery, and Human Blood. A Murtherer's Hand? and not the Touch detest? Ah! where's the wonted Softness of thy Breast? See in his Scars the Prints of Battels fought: Whate'er he has his Body dearly bought. Perhaps the Fool in a vain-glorious Vein, Himself may boast what Numbers he has slain. This can he tell, and Freedoms then obtain? Can you be such a Slave to sordid Gain? Whilst I the Vot'ry of the God of Wit, (Shou'd gentle Phœbus to rude Mars submit?) With fruitless Numbers, unavailing Pow'rs, Sing slighted Verses at obdurate Doors. Learn, who are wise, some thriving Art of Gain, Not such as idle we embrace in vain, But that of Arms, of Fights, and a Campaign. Instead of canting Verses lead a Troop: This, Homer, might, and should have been thy Scope. Jove taught, by what our Manners plainly told, The true Omnipotence of sov'reign Gold, Transform'd himself to what he knew wou'd please, And his corrupted Mistress won with Ease. Till then the Father watch'd against his Joy, The Tow'r was firm, and she herself was coy. But when the golden Lover wisely came, The Sire was willing, and the Damsel tame. Not thus, in Heav'n when good old Saturn reign'd; Then Earth her Silver, Gold, and Brass retain'd, Conceal'd in Darkness, and in Depths below; But Stores far better did above bestow; Nutritious Roots, spontaneous from the Soil, And ready Corn without the Plowman's Toil; Fruit that abounded on unplanted Trees, And hiv'd in Oaks the Nectar of the Bees. None till'd the Ground, but shar'd what it wou'd yield, None mark'd for private Use a measur'd Field. The Seas no Keel disturb'd, nor cleaving Oars; All stop'd contented at their proper Shores. But the Scene chang'd; vain Man would further go, Ambitious much to have, and much to know; Subtly did Things against himself contrive, To his own Hurt too witty and too wise. Where was the Good (if fairly we decide) When Towns he wall'd, and Walls he fortify'd? Where, when inventive of unnumber'd Harms, He furnish'd Discord with destructive Arms? What Need or Bus'ness had advent'rous he To pass the Ocean, or to try the Sea? Land might have serv'd a modester Desire, Why do we not to Heav'n itself aspire? And so we do as far as e'er we can; Thus Gods of old, that once were Men, began, And thus fond modern Saints we canonize, The Mortal dead, the Ghost we idolize. From Earth's dark Mines we Gold and Silver tear, Which here the Soldier gains, and Plund'rers share. No Place is for the Poor; 'tis an Estate Preferment gets; the Rich, that buy, are Great. Why let 'em have, and let 'em govern all, In War, in Peace, the Houses and the Hall. But let them leave the Poor some Property; Let him enjoy his Love and Mistress free. No; whate'er Virtue now the Nymph may have, He that can pay the Price, commands the Slave. For me the watchful Spy has Eyes and Ears; For me she still the jealous Husband fears. Let me give well; that will the Charm undo: The Spy shall vanish, and the Husband too. Revenge ye Gods (for sure Revenge is just) Consume these Metals with eternal Rust, And turn this ill-sought Treasure to its native Dust. Book III. ELEGY XI. To his false Mistress, whom he could not leave loving though he once flatter'd himself with having conquer'd his Passion. Much have I suffer'd, and have suffer'd long; But with unbounded Ill, and endless Wrong, My Patience vanquish'd can no more digest; Be gone, base Love, and leave my wearied Breast. Rescu'd I am, and Chains no longer wear; Blush to have born what I blush'd not to bear. Late came the Strength; but got at last above, Triumphantly I spurn subjected Love. Go on, persist; the useful Pain endure: A bitter Draught has been a frequent Cure. And I have then, so oft repuls'd, deny'd, On the hard Ground laid my dishonour'd Side; I have, while you some Fool embrac'd within, Watch'd without Doors, as Centry to the Sin; Have there the weary Lover seen retire, With weaken'd Limbs, and with extinguish'd Fire; Yet worse; he has seen me too in the Place. Gods! send my Enemies but such Disgrace! When did I fail, Ungrateful, through the Town Obsequious to galant you up and down? Lov'd for my Sake, when in my Company, Others you pleas'd because belov'd by me. Why shou'd I add the Falsehoods of thy Tongue, And Gods invok'd with Perj'ry to my Wrong? Why the stol'n Looks between the Youth and you, The private Entercourse in publick View, By Signs contriv'd, and Notices agreed, Which to tell all the Mind no Language need? 'Twas said, She's sick: I fondly thought it true, And wild with Love and Fear all headlong flew; But when I came, false Fair one, you can tell I for my Rival found you but too well. All this, and more, endur'd to my Disgrace, Get some new Wretch to take my shameful Place. My Bark at last has gain'd the happy Port, And safe, the Waves that toss'd her hears with Sport. Leave your fond Arts, (tho' they have cost me dear) The flatt'ring Words that once so pow'rful were. All are but lost, and will no longer pass; I am not the believing Fool I was. And yet, and yet the struggling Passions move My doubtful Breast, Hate one way, one way Love; And Love, I fear, at last will Victor prove. I'll hate you if I can; if not, at least Will love unwillingly; the lab'ring Beast Likes not his Yoke, yet with the Yoke is prest. I fly your Crimes, and to your Form return, The Lewdness loath, but for the Person burn. Thus can I nor without nor with thee do, And scarce know which I wish for of the two. Oh, that less fair you were or false could be! Too ill such Beauties and such Faults agree. Your Guilt claims Hate, your Looks do Love intreat; Ah me! these more prevailing are than that. Spare then by the sweet Life that once we led, The soft Engagements of our social Bed; By all those Gods you ill so oft have us'd, Who seem content to be by thee abus'd; And by my Deity, that Face of thine, By those bright Eyes which quite have ravish'd mine, Whate'er you are you mine shall ever be, Ever belov'd, ever ador'd by me. Think only whether you wou'd chuse to have A willing Servant, or a murm'ring Slave. No; let me rather spread the ready Sail, And use, and yield me to the driving Gale, Consent to love, since I can never hate, And by my Choice make it yet more my Fate. Book I. ELEGY III. To his Mistress. The Maid that newly has my Heart possess'd (Just are my Wishes, modest my Request) Or let her love, or to the Lover prove So gentle to make him forever love. Ah! 'tis too much, what rashly I have mov'd; Let her but only bear to be belov'd; But condescend humbly to be ador'd, And Venus to these Pray'rs a gracious Ear afford: And thou bright Kindler of this pleasing Fire, Dear lovely Object of my whole Desire, Accept a Slave devoted still to you, That will be constant, and that can be true. If not born high, or to a huge Estate, (For, tho' not mean, I am below the Great) In other Talents yet may be supply'd, What is in Title or in Wealth deny'd. A tuneful Genius, a Poetick Fire, (The Gifts which Heav'n and Nature did inspire) Morals which none can better, or can blame, A naked Plainness, and becoming Shame, These all befriend me, and (what is above All these) to thee my dedicated Love. I am not of that desultory Race, Whom thousands please, and every fresher Face. Trust me, you all my Wishes shall employ, Ever my only Care, my only Joy. What Years of Life may granted be to me, All may I live, or may I die with thee! Permit me this, and, graciously inclin'd, Propitious Matter for my Numbers find, With such a Subject of my Verse and Flame, I'll make that Verse as glorious as my Theam. And Verse to Beauty lasting Fame can give, By Verse fair Iö does herself survive, By Verse Europa yet, and Leda live. Thus also we will share a like Renown, Throughout the World both equally be known, My Muse shall make your Name immortal as my own. The Transmigration of the Soul. From Pythagoras's Speech in the fifteenth Book of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Beginning at the Line, O Genus attonitum gelidæ formidine Mortis, &amp;c. Fond Men, dismay'd with the fantastick Dread Of Death, and what you are to be when Dead, Why do you fear (as real were the Doom) A Stygian Lake, or a Tartarean Gloom, With all the rest of the strange Things below, In Fairy Regions, when from hence we go? Vain Names, of idle Bards the fabulous Theams, And a mistaken World's distracting Dreams. Err not; whate'er of the dead Lump becomes; If Time dissolves it, or if Fire consumes, It nothing of its former Sense retains, Perceives no Ruin, and endures no Pains. The Soul indeed (howe'er Mortality Disjoins the Compound) never is to die. But then its Lot is but removing Seats; One Mansion fall'n, it to a new retreats. Thus I my self, the now Pythagoras, Once, I remember well, Euphorbus was, Whom Trojan Wars, and my unhappy Chance, Gave to be pierc'd by the great Spartan's Lance. In Juno's Temple, and at Argos Town. I lately saw the Shield that was my own. Nothing's annihilated; all things change; Hither and thither does the Spirit range; Passes (in which soever it began) From Man to Beast, and from the Beast to Man; From Limbs to Limbs of every Sort is tost, But never perishes, is never lost. But as an easy Piece of yielding Wax This and that Form indifferently takes, And yet itself in ev'ry varied Frame Continues in its Substance still the same: So does the Soul transmigrate, I maintain, But in all Shapes the self-same Soul remain. Scipio's Vision: From the Beginning of the fifteenth Book of Silius Italicus. But now Rome's Senate a new Care possess'd, Who trembling Nations, and Affairs distress'd Should aid; Who undertake th' Iberian War, Restore the Camp, and quell the Conqueror. The warlike Scipio Brothers both were lost, A Roman Terror, and a Punick Boast. Tartessian Lands, 'twas fear'd would fall away, Dread nearer War, and Tyrian Laws obey. Anxious and sad, the Fathers seek around A healing Med'cine for their Empire's Wound; One who to such a Charge wou'd dare succeed, And pray the Gods to grant the Man they need. The Son by Vengeance long'd to expiate At once an Uncle's, and a Father's Fate. His Friends deter him, struck with Grief and Fears, For Evils fresh, and disproportion'd Years. Shou'd he to the ill-omen'd Province go, (His Kindred's Tomb) he must engage a Foe, Of two old Leaders who had stop'd the Course, Had broke their Counsels, and had broke their Force; Had slain themselves, and now, his Hopes to bless, Was flush'd and flaming with the great Success. Not tender Arms such Weight of War shou'd try; Not a crude Age seek a Command so high. These things beneath a Laurel's verdant Shade, Retir'd, he in his youthful Bosom weigh'd: When on each Hand stood, sudden from the Skies, Two Forms: Far more than mortal was their Size. Virtue, and Pleasure Virtue's Foe, they were, And diff'rent, as they are, they did appear. Her Hair Ambrosial o'er her Shoulders spread, One breath'd rich Odors from her fragrant Head; In Garments shone, illustrious to behold, Of Tyrian Purple, and of Tissu'd Gold; Her Forehead dress'd with Art, while sparkling Flame From wanton Eyes, and wand'ring Glances came. Not t'other so. More rude her Brow; the Hair Nor curl'd with Skill, nor shaded was with Care; Steady her Look, where decent Vigor sate; Nearer Virile her Visage, and her Gate; Alertly modest; of erected Height; Her Robe with snowy Whiteness simply bright. Trusting to Promises she had to make, Pleasure began, and thus the Youth bespake. What Madness this in Arms to wast thy Prime, Not worthy so to lose so sweet a Time? Does Cannæ's Day thy Memory forsake, And Trebia's River, and the Stygian Lake Of Trasimene? Why wilt thou tempt thy Fate, And warring, hazard Shortning Life's short Date? Hast thou in Thought th' Assailing for Renown Atlantick Realms, and the Sidonian Town? Be warn'd; avoid the Perils, and the Harms; Nor rash object thee to the Storm of Arms. Unless thou cease, Virtue will bid advance, Will bid thee charge, regardless of all Chance, Madly through midst of Hosts, and midst of Fire; And cruel Tasks will rigidly require. The Decii, Paulus, on their Fate she threw; Thy Uncle she, and she thy Father slew; Cheating with Dreams of Monuments and Fame, And to a senseless Shade an useless Name. But foll'wing me all smooth shall be thy Ways; No Bound but Nature's to confine thy Days. No Trumpet's Terrors rudely shall molest Thy Morning Slumbers, or thy Ev'ning Rest. No Tropick Suns shalt thou, or Polar Snow, No wretched Meals in Fields of Slaughter know; Nor Thirst, nor choaking Dust from burning Soils, Nor all the fearful Military Toils. But Days serene shall run through ev'ry Stage, And Youth, well-treated, give fair Hopes of Age. How has the God Provision made for Joy In Gifts which you might blissfully employ! Whilst he himself, in unmolested Ease, Indulging all that can his Godhead please, Does of soft Life to Man th' Example give, And teach the Fools how they might wisely live. I, I am she, who did to Venus join The Sire of him who rais'd your Roman Line. I, I am she, who, to pursue his Love, A Swan, a Bull have made of very Jove. Hear me; fast runs the mortal Life of Man; Nor is it giv'n them to be born again: Soon ravish'd hence, nor can they when they go, Their Pleasures carry to the Shades below. Who dying does not, tho' too late, complain That he has let my Hours pass by in vain? She ceas'd; then Virtue thus; With what Abuse, To what obscure false Life wou'dst thou seduce, From the bright Paths of Action and of Praise, A Youth in all the Glory of his Days, To whom the Gods fair Reason have assign'd, And Seeds Celestial of a mighty Mind? As far as the immortal Pow'rs, that dwell Above, the Race of mortal Men excell, Do these all other Animals outgo, Giv'n as a Sort of lesser Gods below. Degen'rate Souls that shame their native Height, Are doom'd by sure Decree to Stygian Night; But such as, acting bravely here on Earth, Preserve the Honour of their heav'nly Birth, The Gate of Heav'n Admission gives to these. What need I name heroick Hercules? Him whom his Tygers bore from Indian Wars? Or Leda's Twins, for whose propitious Stars Tost Sailors wish? or, nearer Home to come, Youth, your Quirinus, God of his own Rome? Dost thou not on the Human Make reflect, The Face Sublime, and Looks to Heav'n erect; While Birds, and Beasts, and every brutal Kind, Lean o'er the Paunch, and all are prone design'd? Man born (if well the Gifts of Heav'n he use) To Glory, Glory happily pursues. See your own Rome (nor farther will I go) That weak and thin was once content, to owe A base Increase to an Asylum's Shame, Nor with Fidenæ Parity could claim, How she by foll'wing me has rais'd her Head, And by her brave Sons Hands her Empire spread. Then see what States, of Pow'r and of Renown, Vice has subverted, and loose Ease cast down. For nor the Wrath of Gods, nor hostile Arms, Procure to Nations or to Men such Harms, As, Pleasure, thou, to those thou dost possess. Thy sure Companion's senseless Drunkenness; Thine wanton Lust, and lazy Luxury, And dark Disgrace, and hov'ring Infamy. With me is Credit, Honour, Glory, Praise, And shining Vict'ry, and Triumphal Bays. Frugal my House, and temp'rate is, and chaste; On a tall Hill my Seat sublimely plac'd. Arduous the Path (which he must mind who treads) And rocky the Ascent that to it leads, Rough too at first, (for I no Falsehoods tell) And who wou'd enter, Youth, must labour well. Nor climb those Goods, or thither seek to come, Which Fortune has to give, and can resume. But, once arriv'd, thou nobly from on high Shalt see the meaner World below thee ly. All the soft Things fond Pleasure promis'd thee, Revers'd thou wilt experiment with me; Stretch'd on hard Straw beneath a Roof of Air, Pass sleepless Nights, and Cold and Hunger bear; To Justice firm, whatever thou wou'dst act, Consider Heav'n as Witness to the Fact; And then when Dangers and thy Country call, Thou first shalt meet the Foe, and mount the Wall; Shalt every Way be resolutely bold, And neither yield to Steel, nor yield to Gold. For all which, not th' effeminate Reward Of glorious Vestments, and of fragrant Nard, But I the Man will give thee to subdue, Who now your Empire does with Arms pursue, And, wasted Carthage to Submission drove, Lay thy proud Laurel in the Lap of Jove. These Things deliver'd from her sacred Breast, The Youth entire was gain'd beyond Contest; Joy'd with th' Examples which her Promise mov'd, And all his Look all he had heard approv'd. Pleasure perceiv'd it wrathfully asham'd; Nor Silence kept, but ravingly exclaim'd, Enough; no longer I your Course delay; Go on, pursue your honourable Way. But know, my Reign shall come; the Time will be When Rome shall honour me, and only me. She toss'd her Head, and all her Form uprear'd, Flew to the Clouds, and darkly disappear'd. But full of Counsels on his Mind imprest, Great Things young Scipio fashions in his Breast, Spirits his Air, and animates his Mien, And kindles with the Love of Virtue seen. FINIS.</field>
