      <field name="fulltext">A PRINCELY SONG made of the Red Rose and the White, royally vnited together by king Henry the seauenth, and Elizabeth Plantaginet, daughter to Edward the fourth, from whom our now Soueraigne Lord King Iames linnially descended. To the tune of when Flying fame. When Yorke and Lankaster made war, within this famous land: The liues of Englands royall peeres, did in much danger stand. Seauen English Kings in bloody feelds, for Englands crowne did fight: In which their heires were all but twaine, of liues bereaued quight. Then thirty thousand Englishmen, were in one battle slaine: Yet could not all this English blood, a setled peace obtaine. For fathers kind their deere sonnes killd, and sonnes their fathers slew: Yea kindreds fought against their kind. and not each others knew. At last by Henries lawfull claime, this wasting warre had end: For Englands peace he soone restord, and did the same defend. For Tyrant Richard, namd the third, chiefe breeder of this woe: By him, was slaine neare Leaster towne, as cronicles doe show. All feares of warre he thus exild, which ioyd each Englishman: And daies of long desired peace, within the land began. He ruld his Kingdome by true loue, to cheire his subiects liues: For euery one had dayly ioy, and comfort of their wiues. King Henry had such princely care, our further peace to frame: Tooke faire Elizabeth to wife, that gallant Yorkest dame. Fourth Edwards daughter (blest of God) to scape King Richards spight: Was thus made Englands peareles Queene, and Henries hearts delight. Thus Henry first of Tudors name, and last of Lankaster: With Yorkes right heire, a true-loues knot, did linke and tie full fast. Renowned Yorke the White Rose gaue, braue Lankaster the Red, By wedlocke here conioynd to grow, both in one princely bed. These Roses sprang and budded faire, and carried such a grace: That Kings of England in their armes, affords them worthy place. And florish may these Roses long, that all the world may tell, The owner of these princely flowers, in vertues doe excell. To glorifie these Roses more, King Henry and his Queene: First plac'd their pictures in red gold, most gorgeous to be seene. The Kings owne gard, now weares the same, vpon their backes and brest: Where loue and loyalty remaines, and euer-more shall rest. The Red Rose on the backe is plast, thereon a crowne of gold: The White Rose on the brest as braue, and costly to behold. Bedeckt most rich with siluer studs, on cotes of Scarlet red: A blushing hew, (which Englands fame) now many a yeare hath bred. Thus Tudor and Plantaginet, these honors first deuized: To well-come long desired peace, with vs so dearely prized. A peace that now maintayned is, by Iames our royall King: For peace brings plenty to the land, with euery blessed thing. To speake againe of Henries praise, his Princely liberall hand: Gaue guifts and graces many waies, vnto this famous land. For which the Lord him blessings sent, and multiplied his store, In that he left more wealth to vs, then any any King before. For first his sweet and louely Queene, a ioy aboue the rest: Brought him both sonnes and daughters faire to make this kingdome blest. The royall blood that was at ebb, so increased by this Queene: That Englands heires vnto this day, doe florish faire and greene. The first faire blessing of his seede was Arthur prince of Wales: Whose vertues to the Spanish court, quite ore the Ocean sayles. There Ferdinand, the King of Spaine, his daughter Katherne gaue: For wife vnto the English Prince, a thing that God would haue. Yet Arthur in his lofty youth, and blooming time of age: Submitted meekely his sweet life, to deaths unpartiall rage. Who dying so, no issew left, the sweet of natures ioy: Which compast England round with griefe and Spaine with sad anoy. King Henries second comfort prou'd, a Henry of his name: In following time eight Henry cald, a King of noble fame. He conquered Bullen by his sword, with many townes in France: His manly might, and fortitude, did Englands fame aduance. He Popish Abbies first supprest, and Papestry puld downe: And bound their lands by parliment, vnto his royall crowne. He had three children by three wiues, all Princes raining here: Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth: a Queene belou'd most deare. These three sweet branches bare no frute, God no such ioy did send: Through which the Kingly Tudors name, in England here had end. The last Plantaginet that liu'd, was nam'd Elizabeth: Elisabeth last Tudor was, the greatest Queene of earth. Seuenth Henry yet we name againe, whose grace gaue free consent: To haue his daughters married both, to Kings of high dessent. Margret the eldest of the twaine, was made great Scotlands Queene, As wise, as faire, as vertuous, as eare was Lady seene. From which faire Queene (our royall King) by lineall course descendeth: And rightfully inioyes that crowne, which God now still befrendeth. For Tudor and Plantaginet, by yeelding vnto death: Hath made renowned Stewards name, the greatest vpon earth. His younger daughter Mary calld, as Princely by degree: Was by her father worthy thought, the Queene of France to be. And after to the Suffolke Duke, was made a noble wife: Where-in the famous English court, she lead a vertuous life. King Henry and his louely Queene, reioyst to see the day: To haue their children thus aduanst, with honors euery way. Which purchast pleasure and content, with many a yeares delight: Till sad mischance by cruell death, procur'd them both a spight. The Queene that faire and princely dame, that mother meeke and mild: To ad more number to her ioyes, againe grew big with child. All which brought comfort to her King, against which carefull hower: He lodgd his deare kind-hearted Queene, in Londons stately Tower. That Tower which prou'd so fatal once, to Princes of degree: Prou'd fatall to this noble Queene, for therein died she. In child-bed lost she her sweet life: her life esteemd so deare, Which had beene Englands louing Queene, full many a happy yeare. The King herewith pocest with griefe, spent many months in moane: And dayly sight and said that he, like her could find out none. Nor none could he in fancy chuse, to make his weded wife: Therefore a widdower would remaine, the remnant of his life. His after daies he spent in peace, and quietnesse of mind: Like King and Queene, as these two were, the world can hardly find. Our King and Queene, yet like to them, in vertue and true loue: Haue heauenly blessings in like sort, from heauenly powers aboue. A delightfull song, of the foure famous feasts of England, the one of them ordayned by King Henry the seuenth, of the honor of Marchant Taylers, shewing how seauen Kings haue bin free of that company, and now last he graced with the loue of our renowned Prince Henry of great Brittaine. To the tune of Treatans toy. England is a Kingdome, of all the world admired: More statelinesse in pleasures, can no way be desired. The court is full of brauery, the citty stor'd with wealth, The law preserueth vnity, the country keepeth health. Yet no like pompe and glory, our cronicles record: As foure great feasts of England, do orderly afford. All others be but dinners calld, or banquete of good sort: And none but fowre be named feasts, which here I will report. Saint Georges feast, the first of all, maintained is by Kings: Where much renowne and royalty, thereof now dayly rings. Princes come from forraine lands, to be Saint Georges Knights: The goulden garter thus is worne, by sundry worthy wights. Saint George our English champion, in most delightfull sort: Is celebrated yeare by yeare, in Englands royall court. The King with all his noble traine, in gould and rich aray, Still glorifies the festiuall, of great Saint Georges day. The honored Maior of London, the second feast ordaines: By which the worthy cittizens, much commendation gaines. For Lords and Iudges of the land, and Knights of good request: To Guild hall comes to countenance, Lord Maior of Londons feast. Also the Sargeants of the law another feast afords: With grace and honor glorified, by Englands Noble Lords. And this we call the Sargiant feast, a third in name and place: But yet there is a fourth like-wise, deserues as gallant grace. The Marchant Taylors company, that fellowship of fame: To Londons lasting dignity, liues honored with the same. A guift King Henry the seauent gaue. kept once in three yeares still, Where gould and gounes be to poore men, giuen by King Henries will. Full many good fat bucks be sent, the fairest and the best: The Kings large forrests can afford, to grace this worthy feast. A feast that makes the number iust, and last account of foure, Therefore let England thus report, of feasts there be no more. Then let all London companies, so highly in renowne: Giue Marchant-taylors name and fame, to weare the lawrell crowne, For seuen of Englands royall Kings, thereof haue all beene free: And with their loues and fauors gracd, this worthy company. King Richard once the second nam'd, vnhappy in his fall: Of all these race of royall Kings, was free-man first of all. Bullinbrooke, fourth Henry next, by order him succeeds, To gloryfie this brotherhood by many Princely deeds, Fift Henry which so valiently, deserued fame in France, Became free of this company, faire London to aduance, Sixt Henry then the next in raigne, though lucklesse in his daies, Of Marchant-taylors free-man was, to his eternall praise. Fourth Edward that right worthy King, beloued of great and small: Also performd a free-mans loue, to this renowned Hall. Third Richard which by cruellty, brought England many woes: Unto this worthy company, no little fauour showes. But richest fauours yet at last, proceeded from a King: Whose wisdome round about the world, in Princes eares doth ring, King Henry whome we call the seuenth, made them the greatest gracd: Because in marchant Taylors Hall, his picture now stands placed. Their charter was his Princely guift, maintaynd vnto this day: He added Marchant to the name, of Taylors as some say. So Martchant Taylors they be cal'd, his royall loue was so: No London company the like, estate of Kings can shoe. From time, to time, we thus behold, the Marchant-Taylers glory: Of whose renowne the Muses pens, may make a lasting story. This loue of Kings begot such loue, of our now royall Prince: For greater loue then his to them, was nere before nor since. It pleased so his Princely minde, in meeke kinde curtesie: To be a friendly free-man made, of this braue company: London then in heart reioyce, and Marchant Taylers sing Forth prayses of this gentle Prince, the sonne of our good King. To tell the welcomes to the world, he then in London had: Might fill vs full of pleasing ioyes, and make our hearts full glad. His triumphs there performd and done, long lasting will remaine: And Chronicles report aright, the order of it plaine. The Lamentable song of the Lord Wigmoore gouernor of Warwicke Castle, and the fayre maid of Dunsmoore: as a warning to all maids to haue care how they yeeld to the wanton delights of young gallants. To the tune of Diana. In Warwicke-sheir there stands a downe, and Dunsmoore heath it hath to name: Adioyning to a country towne, made famous by a maidens name. Faire Isabel she called was, a shepheards daughter as some say: To Wigmoores eare her fame did passe, as he in Warwicke Castle lay. Poore loue-sicke Lord, immediatly, vpon her fame set his delight: And thought much pleasure sure did lie, possessing of so sweet a wight. Therfore to Dunsmore did repaire, to recreate his sickly mind: Where in a summers euening faire, his chance was Isabell to find. She sat amidst a medow greene, most richly spred with smelling flowers. And by a riuer she was seene, to spend away some euening howers. There sat this maiden all alone, washing her selfe in secret wise, Which Uirgin faire to looke vppon, did much delight his longing eyes? She thinking not to be espied. had layd from her her Contrey tire, The tresses of her haire vntide, hung glistring like the golden wier, And as the flakes of winters snow, that lies vnmelted on the plaines. So white her body was in show, like siluer springs did run her vaines. He rauisht with this pleasing sight, Stood as a man amazed still: Suffring his eyes to take delight, That neuer thought they had their fill. She blinded his affection so, That reasons rules were led awry: And loue the coales of lust did blow, Which to a fire soone flamed hye. And though he knew the sinne was great, Yet burned so within his brest: With such a vehement scorching heat, That none but she could lend him rest. Lord Wigmoore thus beeing drownd in lust, By liking of this dainty Dame: He call'd a seruant of great trust, Inquiring straight what was her name. She is quoth he no married wife, But a Shepheards daughter as you see: And with her father leads her life, Whose dwellings by these pastures bee. Her name is Isabel the faire, Then stay quoth he, and speake no more: But to my Castle straight her beare, Her sight hath wounded me full sore. Thus to Lord Wigmoore she was brought, Who with delight his fancies fed: And through his sute such means he wrought That he intic'd her to his bed. This beeing done incontinent, She did returne from whence she came, And euery day she did inuent, To couer her receiued shame. But ere three months were fully past, Her crime committed plaine appeares: Unto Lord Wigmoore then in hast, She long complain'd with weeping teares. The complaint of faire Isabell for the losse of her honor, at the end whereof shee slew her selfe. To the same tune. Lord Wigmoore thus I haue defild, And spotted my pure Uirgins bed: Behold I am conceau'd with childe, To which vile folly you me led. For now this deed that I haue wrought, Throughout this country well is knowne, And to my wofull parents brought, Whom now for me do make great mone. How shall I looke them in the face, When they my shamelesse selfe shall see: Oh cursed Eue I feele thy case, When thou hadst tasted on the tree. Thou hidst thy selfe and so must I, But God thy trespasse quickly found: The darke may hide me from mans eye, But leaue my shame still to abound. Wide open are mine eyes to looke, Vpon my seed and heauy sinne: And quite vnclasped is the booke, Where my accounts are written in. This sinne of mine deserueth death, Be Iudge Lord Wigmoore I am shee: For I haue tread a strumpets path, And for the same I needs must dye. Bespotted with reproachfull shame, To ages following shall I bee: And in records be writ my blame, Lord Wigmoore this is long of thee. Lord Wigmoore prostrate at thy feete, I craue my iust deserued doome: That death may cut off from the roote, This body, blossom, branch and bloome. Let modesty accuse this crime, Let loue, and law, and nature speake: Was euer any wretch yet seene, That in one instant all did breake. Then Wigmoore Iustice on me shew, That thus consented to this act: Giue me my death, for death is due, To such as sinnes in such a fact. Oh that the wombe had beene my graue, Or I had perisht in my birth: Or that same day may darknesse haue, Wherein I first drew vitall breath. Let God regard it not at all, Let not the sunne vpon it shine: Let misty darknesse on it fall, For to make knowne this sinne of mine. The night wherein I was conceau'd, Let be accurst with mournefull cryes: Let twinckling starres from skyes bereau'd, And clowds of darkenesse thereon rise. Because they shot not vp the powers, That gaue the passage to my life: Come sorrow finish vp mine howers, And let my time here end in griefe. And hauing made this wofull moane, A knife she snatched from her side. Where Lucresse part was rightly showne. For with the same fayre Isabell dyed. Hereat Lord Wigmoore greeued sore, In heart repenting his amisse: And after would attempt no more, To crop the flowers of Maidens blisse. But liued long in wofull wise, Till death did finish vp his dayes: And now in Isabels graue he lyes, Till iudgment comes them both to raise. A Song of Sir Richard Whittington, who by strange fortunes, came to bee thrice Lord Maior of London, with his bountifull guifts and liberallity giuen to this honorable Citty. To the tune of dainty come thou to me. Here must I tell the praise, of worthy Whittington: Knowne to be in his dayes, thrice Maior of London. But of poore parentage, borne was he as we heare: And in his tender age, bred vp in Lancashire. Poorely to London than, came vp this simple lad: Where with a Marchant man, soone he a dwelling had. And in a Kitchin plast, a scullion for to be. Wheras long time he past, in labour drudgingly. His daily seruice was, turning spitts at the fire: And to scoure pots of brasse, for a poore Scullions hire. Meat and drinke all his pay, of coyne he had no store: Therefore to run away, in secret thought he bore. So from this marchant man, Whittington secretly: Towards his Contry ran, to purchase liberty. But as he went along, in a faire summer morne, London bells sweetly rung, Whittington back returne. Euermore sounding so, turne againe Whittington: For thou in time shalt grow, Lord Maior of London. Wherevpon back againe, VVhittington came with speed: A prentise to remaine, as the Lord had decreed. Still blessed be the bells, this was his daily song: They my good fortune tells, most sweetly haue they rung. If God so fauour me, I will not prooue vnkind: London my loue shall see, and my great bounties find. But see his happy chance, this Scullion had a Cat: Which did his state aduance, and by it wealth he gat. His maister ventred forth, to a land far vnknowne, With Marchandize of worth, as is in stories showne. VVhittington had no more, but his poore Cat as than: Which to the ship he bore, like a braue Marchant man. Uentring the same (quoth he) I may get store of gold: And Maior of London be, as the bells haue me told. Whittingtons Marchandize, carried was to a land: Troubled with Rats and Mice, as they did vnderstand: The King of that Contry there, as he at dinner sat: Daily remain'd in feare, of many a Mouse and Rat. Meat that on trenchers lay, no way they could keepe safe: But by Rats borne away, fearing no wand nor staffe, Wherevpon soone they brought, Whittingtons nimble Cat: Which by the King was bought, heapes of gold giuen for that. Home againe came these men, with their ship loaden so: Whittingtons wealth began, by this cat thus to grow. Scullions life he forsooke, to be a Marchant good: And soone began to looke, how well his credit stood. After this he was chose, Shriefe of this citty heere: And then full quickly rose, higher as did appeare. For to this Citties praise, Sir Richard Whittington: Came to be in his dayes, thrise Maior of London. More his fame to aduance, thousands he lent his King: To maintaine warres in France, Glory from thence to bring. And after at a feast, that he the King did make: Burnd the bands all in ieast, and would no money take. Ten thousand pound he gaue, to his Prince willingly: And would not one penny haue, thus in kind curtesie, God did thus make him great: So would he daily see, poore people fed with meat. Prisoners poore cherisht were, widdowes sweet comfort found: Good deedes both far and neere, of him do still resound. Whittington Colledge is, one of his charities: Records reporteth this, to lasting memories. Newgate he builded faire, for prisoners to liue in, Christ Church he did repaire, Christian loue for to win: Many more such like deedes, was done by VVhittington: Which Ioy and Comfort breedes, to such as lookes thereon. Lancashire thou hast bred, this flower of Charity: Though he be gon and dead, yet liues he lastingly, Those bells that cald him so, turne againe Whittington: Call you back many moe, to liue so in London. The life and death of the great Duke of Buckingham, who came to an vntimely end, for consenting to the deposing of the two gallant young princes, King Edward the fourths Children. To the tune of Shores wife. A Tale of griefe I must vnfold, a tale that neuer yet was told: A tale that might to pitty mooue, the spirits below and Saints aboue. When warres did plague this maiden land, great Buckingham in grace did stand: With Kings and Queenes he ruled so, when he said I, none durst say no. Great Glosters Duke that washt the throane with blood of Kings, to makt his owne: By Henry Staffords help obtaind what reason wild to be refraind. If any noble of this land, against great Glosters arme did stand: Ould Buckingham with might and power, in seas of woes did him deuoure. He hoped when Richard was made King, he would much greater honors bring: To Buckingham and to his name, and well reward him for the same. In Clarence death he had a hand, and gainst King Edwards Queen did stand, And to hir sonnes bore little loue, when he as Bastards would them prooue. King Edward swore him by his oth, in true aledgeance to them both, Which if I faile I wish quoth he, all Christians curse may light on me. It so fell out on All Soules day, by law his life was tane away: He had his wish though not his will, for treasons end is alwaies ill. In London hauing pleaded claime, and Richard thereby won the game: He challengd honour for his gaine but was rewarded with disdaine. On which disgrace within few houres, Great Buckingham had raisd his powers, But all in vaine the King was strong, and Stafford needs must suffer wrong. His Army faild and durst not stand, vpon a Traitors false command: Beeing thus deceaued ould Stafford fled, not knowing where to hide his head. The King with speed to haue him found, did offer ful two thousand pound: Thus Richard sought to cast him downe, whose wit did win him Englands Crowne. The plaine old Duke his life to saue, of his owne man did succour craue: In hope that he would him releiue, that late much land to him did giue. Base Banester this man was nam'd, by this vild deed for euer sham'd: It is quoth he a common thing, to iniure him that wrongd his King. King Edwards children he betraid, the like gainst him I will haue plaid. Being true, my heart him greatly grast, but prouing false that loue is past. Thus Banester his maister sold, vnto his foe, for hier of gold: But marke his end and rightly see, the iust reward of trechery. The Duke by law did loose his blood, for him he sought to doe most good: The man that wrought his Maisters woe, by lingring griefe was brought full low. For when the King did heare him speake, how basely he the Duke did take: In stead of gold gaue him disgrace, with banishment from towne and place. Thus Banester was forst to beg, and craue for food with cap and leg: But none to him would bread bestow: that to his master proued a foe. Thus wandred he in poore estate: repenting his misdeed to late: Till starued he gaue vp his breath, by no man pittied at his death, To wofull ends his Children came, sore punisht for their fathers shame: Within a kennell one was drownd, where water scarse could hide the ground: Another by the powers diuine, was strangely eaten vp of swine:: The last a wofull ending makes, by strangling in a stinking Iakes. Let traitors this behold and see, and such as false to masters be: Let disobedient sonnes draw neere, these iudgements wel may touch them neere Both old and young that liue not well, looke to be plagu'd, by heauen or hell: So haue you heard the story than, of this great Duke of Buckingham. The wofull death of Queene Iane Wife to King Henry the eight. and how King Edward was cut out of his mothers belly. To the tune of the lamentation for the Lord of Essex. When as King Henry ruld this land, he had a Queene I vnderstand: Lord Semors daughter faire and bright, King Henries comfort and delight: Yet death by his remorslesse power, did blast the bloome of this sweet flower. Oh mourne, mourne mourn faire Ladies, Iane your Queene the flower of England dies. His former Queenes beeing wrapt in lead, This gallant Dame possest his bed: Where rightly from her wombe did spring, a ioyfull comfort to hir King, A welcome blessing to the land, preserud by Gods most holy hand. Oh mourne, mourne mourne faire Ladies, Iane your Queen the flower of England dies. The Queen in trauell pained sore, full thirty wofull daies and more: And no way could deliuered be, as euery Lady wisht to see, Wherefore the King made greater mone, then euer yet his grace had showne. Oh mourne, mourne mourne, faire Ladies, Iane your Queen the flower of England dies. Beeing somthing eased in his mind, his eyes a slumbring sleepe did find: Where dreaming he had lost a rose, but which he could not well suppose, A ship he had a rose by name, oh no it was his royall Iane: Oh mourne, mourne, mourne faire Ladies, Iane your Queen the flower of England dies. Being thus perplext in greefe and care, a Lady to him did repaire: And said oh King shew vs thy will, thy Queenes sweet life to saue or spill. If she cannot deliuered be, yet saue the flower if not the tree. Oh mourne, mourne, mourne, faire Ladies, Iane your Queene, the flower of England dies. Then downe vppon his tender knee, for help from heauen prayed he: Meane while into a sleepe they cast, his Queene which euermore did last. And opening then her tender woombe, aliue they tooke this budding bloome: Oh mourne, mourne, mourne, faire Ladies, Iane your Queen the flower of Englands dead This babe so borne much comfort brought, and cheard his fathers drooping thought: Prince Edward he was cald by name, gracd with vertue wit and fame: And when his father left this earth, he ruld this land by law full birth. Oh mourne, mourne, mourne, faire Ladies, Iane your Queen the flower of Englands dead But marke the powerfull will of heauen, we from this ioy were soone bereauen. Six yeares he raigned in this land, and then obeyed Gods command, And left his Crowne to Mary heere, whose fiue years raigne cost England deare Oh mourne, mourne, mourne faire Ladies, Iane your Queen the flower of Englands dead Elizabeth raigned next to her, Europes pride and Englands starre: Wonder world, foor such a Queene, vnder heauen was neuer seene. A mayd, a Saint, an Angell bright, in whom all princes tooke delight: Oh mourne, mourne, mourne faire Ladies, Elizabeth the flower of Englands dead. A short and sweet sonnet made by one of the maides of honor vpon the death of Queene Elizabeth, which she sowed vppon a sampler in red silke. To a new tune or to Phillida flouts me. Gone is Elizabeth, whom we haue lou'd so deare: She our kind Mistris was, full foure and forty yeare. England she gouernd well not to be blamed: Flanders she succord still, and Ireland tamed. France she befrended, Spaine she hath foiled: Papists reiected, and the Pope spoyled. To Princes powerfull, to the world vertuous: To her foes mercifull, to subiects gracious. Her soule is in heauen, the world keepes her glory: Subiects her good deeds, and so ends my story. The life and death of famous Th. Stukely, an English gallant in the time of Queene Elizabeth, who ended his dayes in a battaile of Kings in Barbarie. To the tune of King Henries going to Bullin. In the west of England, borne there was I vnderstand: A famous gallant liuing in his dayes. by birth a wealthy Clothiers sonne, Deeds of wonder he hath done, to purchase him a long and lasting praise. If I should tell his story, pride was all his glory: And lusty Stuekly he was cald in court. he serud a Bishop of the west, And did accompany the best maintaining still him selfe in galant sort. Being thus esteemed, and euery where well deemed: He gaind the fauour of a London dame: daughter to an Alderman, Curtis he was called than, to whom a sutor gallantly he came. When she his person spied, he could not be denied So braue a Gentle man he was to see, she was quickly made his wife: In weale or woe to lead her life, her father willingly did so agree. Thus in state and pleasure, ful many daies they measure: Till cruell death with his regardles spight: bore old Curtis to his graue, A thing that Stukely wisht to haue, that he might reuell all in gold so bright. He was no sooner toombed, but Stukely presumed: To spend a hundred pound that day in wast: the brauest gallants of the land, Had Stukelies purse at their command, thus merily the time away he past. Tauerns and Ordinaries, were his cheefest braueries, Goulden angells flew there vp and downe: riots were his best delight, With stately feastings day and night, in court and Citty thus he won renowne. Thus wasting land and liuing, by this his lawlesse giuing: At last he sould the pauements of his yard: which couered were with blocks of tin, Old Curtis left the same to him, which he consumed vainely as you heard. Whereat his wife sore greeued, desird to be releeued, Make much of me deere husband she did say, Ile make much more of thee quoth he, then any one shall verily, Ile sell thy clothes, and so will go my way. Cruelly thus hearted, away from her he parted, And trauelled to Italy with speed, there he florisht many a day In his silkes and rich aray: and did the pleasures of a Lady feed. It was this Ladies pleasure, to giue him gold and treasure, And to maintaine him in great pomp and fame at last came newes assuredly. Of a battaile fought in Barbary, and he would valiantly go see the same. Many a noble gallant, sould both land and tallant: To follow Stukely to this famous fight: whereas three Kings in person would, Aduentrously with courage bould, within the battaile shew themselues in sight, Stukely and his followers all, of the King of Portugall, Had entertainement like to gentlemen, the King affected Stukely so, That he his secrets all did know: and bore his royall standard now and then. Upon this day of honour, each King did shew his banner, Morocco and the King of Barbery, Portugall with al his traine, Brauely glistred on the plaine: and gaue the onset there most valiantly. The Cannons they resounded, thundring drums rebounded: Kill, kill, as then was all the soldiers cry, mangled men lay on the grownd, And with blood the earth was dround, the sun was likewise darkened in the skye Heauen was sore displeased, and would not be appeased: But tokens of Gods heauy wrath did show: that he was angry at this war, He sent a fearefull blazing star, wherby these Kings might their misfortunes know Bloody was this slaughter, or rather wilfull murther: Whhere sixscore thousand fighting men was slaine, three Kings within this battaile died, With forty Dukes and Earles beside, the like will neuer more be fought againe. With woful armes infoulding, Stukely stood beholding This bloody sacrifice of soules that day: he sighing said I wofull wight, Against my Conscience heere did fight, and brought my followers all vnto decay. Being thus molested, and with greefes oppressed, These braue Italians that did sell their lands with Stukely thus to trauell forth, And venture liues for little worth, vpon him al did lay their murthering hands. Unto death thus wounded, his heart with sorrow sounded: And to them all he made this heauy mone, thus hane I left my contry deere, To be so vildly murthered heere: euen in this place wheras I am not known. My wife I haue much wronged, for what to her belonged: I vainely spent in idle course of life. what I haue done is past I see, And bringeth naught but greefe to me, therfore grant now thy pardon gentle wife. Life I see consumeth, and death I feele presumeth: To change this life of mine into a new: yet this me greatest comfort brings, I liu'd and died in loue of Kings, and so braue Stukely bids the world adew. Stukelies life thus ended, was after death befrended, And like a soldier buried gallantly. where now there stands vpon his graue, A stately temple builded braue: with golden Turrets peircing in the skye. FINIS. A most royall song of the life and death of our late renowned Princesse Queene Elizabeth. To the tune of the Ladies fall. In England raigned once a king, eight Henry cald by name: Which made faire Anne of bullaine Queene, of England in great fame. UUho brought vnto this Contry ioy. and to her King delight: A daughter that in England made, Gods Gospell shine most bright. At Greenwitch was this Princesse borne, that gallant place in Kent: A house belou'd of Kings and Queenes, a house of sweet content. Euen in her childhood she beganne, so stor'd with heauenly grace: That all Estates both high and low, her virtues did embrace. None like Elizabeth was found, in learning so deuine: She had the perfect skilfull arts, of all the muses nine. In Latten Greeke and Hebrew shee, most excellent was knowne: To forraine Kings Ambassadors, the same was daily showne, The Itallian French and Spannish tongue, she well could speake and read. The Turkish and Arabian speech, grew perfect at her need. Her musicke made her wonderfull, so cunning therein found: The fame whereof about the world, in Princes eares did sound. Yet when her royall parents liues, by death were tane away: And her deare brother Edward turnd, to clodds of earth and clay. Her cruell sister Mary sought, her lasting greefe and woe, Regarding not the guifts that God, vppon her did bestow. A bloody raigne Queene Mary liud, a Papist in beleefe: Which was vnto Elizabeth, a great heart breaking greefe. A faithfull Protestant was she, at which Queene Mary spighted, And in Elizabethes mishaps, she daily much delighted. Poore maiden by the Bishops wills, in prison she was put: And from her frends and comforters, in cruell manner shut. Much hoping she would turne in time, and her true faith forsake: But firme she was and patiently, did all these troubles take. Her sister forthwith gaue command, her diat to be small: Her seruants likewise very few, yea almost none at all. And also would haue tane her life, but that King Phillip said: Oh Queene thy contry will report, thou hast the Tiger plaid. The Lord thus put this King in mind, his chosen Saint to saue: And likewise to Queene Maries life, a sodaine ending gaue. And so Elizabeth was fetcht, from prison to a crowne: Which she full foure and forty yeares, possest with much renowne. She popery first of all supprest, and in our English tongue: Did cause Gods bible to be read, which heauen continue long. Poore preaching likewise she ordaind, with plenty in this land: And still against the foes thereof most zealously did stand, The pride of Rome this Queene abates, and spightfull Spaine kept vnder: And succord much Low-contry states, whereat the world did wonder: That such a worthy Prince as she, should worke such worthy things: And bring more honor to this land, then all our former Kings. The gould stil brought from Spanish mines, in spight of all her foes: Throughout all parts of Christendome, her braue aduentures shewes. Her battels fought vpon the Seas resounded vp to heauen: Which to aduance her fame and praise, her victory still giuen. The Spanish power in eighty eight, which thirsted for her blood: Most nobly like an Amazon their purposes withstood. And boldly in her royall campe, in person she was seene: The like was neuer done I thinke, by any Englih Queene. Full many a Traytor since that time, she hath confounded quite: And not the bloodiest mind of all, hir courage could affright. For mercy ioynd with maiesty, still made her foes her friends: By pardoning many which deserud, to haue vntimely ends. Tirone with all his Irish rout, of rebells in that land: Though nere so desperate bold and stout, but feard her great command. She made them quake and tremble sore but for to heare her name: She planted peace in that faire land, and did their wildnesse tame. Though warres she kept with dangers great, in Ireland, France and Spayne. Yet her true subiects still at home, in safety did remaine, They ioyd to see her princely face, and would in nombers run: To meet her royall Maiesty, more thick then moates in Sun. But time that brings all thinges to end, a swift foot course did run: And of this royall maiden Queene, a wofull conquest won. Hir death brought feare vppon the land, no wordes but tales of woe: In Subiects eares resounded then, where euer men did goe: But feare exchangd to present ioyes, sweet comforts loud did ring: In stead of Queene the people cryd, long liue our royall King. Which name of King did seeme most strang, and made vs sore to muse: Because full many a yeare the name, of King we did not vse: But such a noble King he is, and so maintaines our peace: That we in heart may dayly wish, his life may neuer cease. His Queene and his posterity, good angels still defend, This is my muses chiefe desire, her melody to end. FINIS. A Song of a Beggar and a King. I read that once in Affrica, a Prince that there did raine: Who had to name Cophetua, as Poets they did faine. From Natures workes he did incline, For sure he was not of my minde, He cared not for women kinde, but did them all disdaine. But marke what happened by the way, As he out of his window lay, He saw a beggar all in gray, which did increase his paine. The blinded bay that shootes so trim, from heauen downe so high: He drew a Dart and shot at him, in place where he did lye. Which soone did pierse him to the quick, For when he felt the arrow prick, Which in his tender heart did stick, he looketh as he would dye. What sudden chance is this quoth he, That I to loue must subiect be, Which neuer thereto would agree, but still did it defie. Then from his window he did come, and laid him on his bed: A thousand heapes of care did runne, within his troubled head. For now he meanes to craue her loue, And now he seekes which way to prooue: How he his fancie might remooue, and not this beggar wed. But Cupid had him so in snare, That this poore begger must prepare: A salue to cure him of his care, or els he would be dead: And as he musing thus did lye, he thought for to deuise: How he might haue her company, that so did mase his eyes: In thee quoth he, doth rest my life, For surely thou shalt be my wife: Or else this hand with bloody knife, the Gods shall sure suffice. Then from his bed he arose, And to his Pallace gate he goes, Full little then this begger knowes, when she the King espied. The Gods preserue your Maiesty, the beggars all gan cry: Uouchsafe to giue your charity, our childrens food to buy. The King to them his pursse did cast, And they to part it made great hast: The silly woman was the last, that after them did hye. The King he cald her back againe, And vnto her he gaue his chaine: And said with vs you shall remaine, till such time as we dye. For thou shalt be my wife quoth he, and honoured like the Queene: With thee I meane to lead my life, as shortly shall be seene. Our wedding day shall appointed be, And euery thing in their degree: Come on quoth he and follow me, thou shalt go shift thee cleane. What is thy name, say on quoth he, Phenelophon O King quoth she, With that she made a lowe courtsey, a trim one as I weene. Thus hand in hand along they walke, vnto the Kings Pallace: The King with courteous comly talke, this begger doth imbrace. The begger blusheth Scarlet read, And straight againe as pale as lead, But not a word at all she said, she was in such a mase: At last she spake with trembling voyce, And said O King I do reioyce: That you will take me for your choice, and my degree so base. And when the wedding day was come, the King commanded straight: The noble men both all and some, vpon the Queene to waight. And she behaued her selfe that day, As if she had neuer walkt the way, She had forgot her gowne of gray, that she did weare of late. The Prouerbe old is come to passe, The Priest when he began his masse, Forgets that euer Clarke he was, he knoweth not his estate. Here may you read Copherua, through fancie long time fed: Compelled by the blinded boy, the beggar for to wed. He that did louers lookes disdaine, To do the same, was glad and faine, Or else he would himselfe haue slaine, in stories as we read: Disdaine no whit O Lady deere, But pitty now thy seruant heere, Least that it hap to thee this yeare, as to that King it did. And thus they lead a quiet life, During their princely raine. And in a tombe were buried both, as writers she weth plaine. The Lords they tooke it grieuously, The Ladies tooke it heauily, The Commons cryed pitiously, their death to them was paine. Their fame did sound so passingly, That it did pierce the Starry sky, And thorow out the world did flye, to euery Princes realme. FINIS. A Louers Song in praise of his Mistresse. To the tune of Apelles. If that Appelles now did raigne, who euer sought for to haue fame: He might haue wone with lesser paine, a greater honor to his name. For with great paine he sought all Greece, Till he had found the fairest peece. Throughout all Greece he could not view, so faire, so feate, so fine withall: Nor yet his pencell neuer drew, so faire a peece and neuer shall, Wherefore if he had seene those dayes, He might haue wone a greater praise. Oh happy man might he haue said, if he had liued to this time: For to haue seene so faire a Maide, in all proportions made so fine. Her fullgent face, so faire, so cleare, That Europe cannot shew her peere. Pigmalion with his grauers then. could neuer worke so faire a peece: Nor yet Apelles in his time, did neuer see the like in Greece, For if he had he would haue said, That Venus was not like this maid. She is a graft of noble groweth, and worthy is she of her fame: For why her vertues plainely sheweth, that well she hath deserud the same. Wherefore my painfull pen alwaies, Shall neuer cease to write her praise. O that my pen could print her praise, according to her iust desert. That I might say and see those dayes, that I desired with my heart For still I sought and euer shall, My Mistres praise might passe them all. Now proofe and praise in one is knit, and hath blowne to praise this maide And Iustice doth in Iudgment sit, for to performe that I haue saide Thus to conclud an end to make, vnto the gods I her betake. Another.To a new tune. The Bee doth loue the sweetest flower, so doth the blossome the Aprill shower: And I doe loue that Lady truely, why should not I loue her that loues me. The bird doth loue the morning bright, to see the day is her delight: And I do loue to see her face, in whome that I doe loue is my solace. The fish doth loue the flouds by kind, for want of it they are but pynd: And I doe loue her presents also, in whome that I loue and loue no mo. The Lybard doth loue to lie and pray, vpon the faces that goeth him by: And I do loue to looke and gase, vpon my true-loues most pleasant face. The Deere doth loue in woods to dwell, as I to you the truth shall tell, And I doe loue as doth the deere, oh whereas I loue would Christ I were. Troylus that Lord withall his might, Cressed of Troy that was so bright: And I do loue as farre as he, and euer shall vntill I dye. FINIS. In praise and dispraise of women. To a pleasant new tune. VVomen to praise who taketh in hand, a number shall displease: But who so doth them most dispraise, doth most liue at their ease. Whereat I muse and maruaile much, and shall do till I die, And if you thinke I say not true, aske them if that I lye. They are mans aid and only stay, and comfort at his need: They cherisht him in all affaires, how euer that he speed. And that that she for him may doe, she doth it willingly. And if, &amp;c. And when their husbands be farre from hand, then wil they spin and carde: They wil not gossip and go gay, but then they fare full hard. They rise vp early and lye downe late, they labour earnestly, To saue a penny or a groat, aske them, &amp;c. And if her husband chance to chide, she giues him not a word: Or if he fight she answers him, no more then doth abourd. But out she goeth about her worke, and takes all patiently: Except she croune him with a stoole, Aske them, &amp;c. Or with her ten commandements, she takes him on the face: That from his cheekes downe to his chin: a man may see each race. The goodman then must weare a clout, the goodwife she will dye: Her husband hurt so heauily, she takes, or else I ly. Then to his bed she wil not come, nor with him will be greed: Unlesse she haue a Petticoate, or elce some other weed. And when she with her gossips met, she telles them by and by: how she her husband handled hath, aske, &amp;c. Well done good gossip saith the one, your practise well we praise: I drinke to you for your good deed the second gossip sayes. They all to put the same in vre, do promise by and by: Which they fulfil vnto their power, forthwith, or else I lye. Good wiues a iudgement I you pray: your verdit Let me heere: Where all be falce or all be true, by you it must appeare: How euer that the mattter goeth, the trueth you must descry: Or else it is not possible, to know if that I lye. FINIS. The Louers fairing sent to his best beloued. To the tune of I wander vp and downe. My comfort and my ioy, this fairing I do send: Let not vnkindnesse him destroy, that is thy faithfull friend. A loyall heart I send, to thee the same I giue: O cherish it, and keepe it safe, and so the same will liue. But if you it forsake, and will not yeeld it grace: It liues, and dyes, and soone is fled, within a little space. O flie no promise made, nor do me not disdaine: One frowne will strike so cruelly, that I shall liue in paine. A smile reuiues me being dead, and is a ioyfull treasure: O let that sunne-shine ere be spred, for it is my chiefe treasure. My selfe, and wealth, and all I haue, a Fairing I do giue: To thee that first my heart possest, and still maist make me liue. Steele not thy heart nor make it hard, but intertaine mine Inne: So may I boast, and still shall say, I shall much comfort win. Returne me comfort back, let me not languish euer: For I am thine, and euer shall, till death my life do seuer. FINIS. The Maidens kind answere to her louer. To the same tune. Take courage gentle loue, I neuer will thee forsake: Nor while I liue shall euer man, possession of me take, Thy Loyall heart Ile keepe, and send mine back to thee: Mine is in feare to liue in paine, but thine I am sure is free. The promise that I made, I vow and sweare Ile keepe: My loue to thee shall euer wake, oh neuer let thine sleepe. No frownes shall kill my face, but smiles shall stil be seene: I long vntil I see thy face, that absent long hath beene. My heart doth melt like ware, and neuer shall be hard: Women haue neuer steely hearts, for then their sex were mard. All comfort I can send, I do returne to thee: My heart, my selfe, and all I haue, is thine eternally. Finis. A maides complaint for lack of a loue: Expressing the anguish in mind she doth prooue No Maiden may so well as I, complaine of her hard destiny: I am now in prime of yeares, yet there is no yong man beares, A brest that harboreth a heart, that hath compassion on my smart. Therefore I am sore affraid, I shall liue and dye a maid. I cast as other maidens doe, Amorous glances for to woe: Youngmen to settle on my loue, but those glances do not prooue. They are like shaftes by blindmen shot, against a marke that nere is hot. Therefore I am sore affraid, I shall liue and die a maide. Twenty winters haue I seene, as as many sommers greene, Tis enough to breed dispaire, so long a maiden-head to beare, Tis a burden of such waight, that I would faine be easd oft straight. But alasse I am afraid, &amp;c. I know that young-men me reiect, my beauty merrits more respect: My quicke gray eye my chery cheeke, where they may finde that list to seeke Matter to increase loues fire, and to stir them to desire: But alasse I am afraid, &amp;c. Higho I loue, yet modesty, bids me not too too free: In demonstrating my paine, least rebuke and shame I gaine. But where fire is there it smoakes, anguish followes heauy stroakes: Out alasse I am afraid. &amp;c. I loue, yet loue binds me to paine, loue reiected's louers baine, We maides are bound by modesty, at all assaies to secrecy. Modestie's too strict a dame, to her will I cannot frame. Out alasse I am afraid, &amp;c. Time hath wrought an alteration, blushing is a fooliw fashion: All maides leaue it, so will I, and to my sore, a salue apply. Babish blushing hinders all, who would to modesty be thrall. I will be no more afraid, Ile no longer be a maide. Bashfull young-men make vs bould, when they loue in bondage hould, They take from vs that ruddy dye, that should vpon our faces lye. Condemne vs not then, loue makes way, like fire that's hid in dryest hay, I will be no more afraid, Ile no longer liue a maide. FINIS. The Lamentation of an Ale-wifes daughter for the losse of her Virginity.To a new tune. In the spring time when Plants do bud, and birds vse chirping notes: When beasts do gather heart of grasse, and fish in water flotes. It was my chance for to espie, a Nimph of Venus traine: Which in a groue wherein she sat, did mightily complaine: I hearkned to her sad lament, I listned to her tale, Whereby it seemed that she had, set honesty to sale: Alas said shee, that mother deere, an Alewife was to me: Or that it was my heauie chance, to vse bad company. Wo be to him that with the Oyle, of Angels me intis'd: Thrise woe be to the golden baits, that often me surpris'd. Woe to the toyes of youth too rash, woe to the crafty snares Of Crooked age, that youth doe catch, in nets at vnawares. Woe to dame Nature for hir paines, in making me the glasse For others, for to scoffe and laugh, as they the way do passe. Then gushed out the Siluer streames, of water from her eyes, Which did bedew her Roseate cheekes, and that in dolefull wise. IenkinAt which I came, &amp; spake these words, what fortune hath decreed? Or how? or why? haue fatall fates, committed such a deed? That thou the mirror of our age, and pride of Natures bower: Farre sweeter then the ruddy Rose, or gallant Gillyflower, Should'st thus lament and pine away? whose cheerfull countenance The hearts of yong and eake of old, hath causd full oft to daunce, Ist losse of loue? Ist want of wealth? Is cause thou sleepest alone? Or Ist the death of some deare friend, that causeth thee to mone? Ioo.Not so, my friend, what doest thou mean, to make the thing so strange: Experience teacheth after full, there needs must be a change. The golden baite intised hath, the pretious Pearle from me: Which to be gotten back againe, remaines without remedy. Ien.Your meaning (sweet) I do not know, I pray you tell it plaine: Faine would I finde some remedy, to ease you of your paine. Ioo. I thanke you for your kind good will, which you did shew to me: In recompence whereof I will, my words make plaine to thee. As nature had adorned me, with gifts of beauty rare: So for to deck and trim my selfe, was all my chiefest care, Then many suters came to me, and most my betters were. Whom I disdain'd and set light by, my minde was so seuere, At length there came an aged man, of money store had he: Who with his bags and golden baits, hath bred my misery. My mother yeelded her consent, and causd me doe the same: Which maketh me thus to lament, that I must liue in shame. Let Maidens then example take, and warning by my fall: Least they like me, should catched be, by comming to the call. Thus hast thou heard my friend my griefe, I can no longer stay: Adew, and twenty times farewell, this sorrowfull month of May. FINIS. A new Sonnet of Coridon and Phillida. Coridon arise my Coridon, Titan shineth cleare: Cor. Who is it that calleth Coridon, who is it I heare. Phi Phillida thy true loue calleth thee, arise then, arise then, Arise and feed thy flocks with me. Cor. Phillida my true is it she? I come then, I come then, I come and feed my flocks with thee. Phi. Here are cheries ripe my Coridon, eate them for my sake: Cor. Heres my oaten pipe my louely on, sport for thee to make. Here are threeds my true-loue fine as silke, to knit thee, to knit thee, A paire of stockins white as milke. here are reeds my true-loue fine and neat, To make thee, to make thee, a bonnet to withstand the heate. Phi. I will gather flowers my Coridon, to set in thy Cap: Cor. I will gather pears my louely on, to set in thy lap. Phi. I wil buy my true-loue garters gay for Sundaies, for Sundaies: To weare about his legs so tall, Cor. I will buy my true-loue yellow saye, For Sundaies, for Sundaies, to weare about her midle small. Phi. When my Coridon sits on a hill, making melody: Cor. When my louely on sits at her wheele, singing cheerely. Sure me thinkes my true-loue doth excell, for sweetnesse, for sweetnesse, Our Pan that old Arcadian knight, and me thinkes my true-loue beares y? bell, For clearenesse, for clearenesse: beyond the nimphs that be so bright. Phi. Had my Coridon, my Coridon, bin alacke my swaine: Had my louely on, my louely on, bin in Ida plaine. Cinthia Endimion had refus'd, preferring, preferring: My Coridon to play withall. the Queene of loue had bin excus'd, Bequeathing, Bequething: my Phillida the golden ball, Yonder comes my mother, Coridon, whither shall I fly: Under yonder beech my louely one, While she passeth by. Say to her thy true-loue was not here, remember, remember: To morrow is another day. doubt me not my true-loue do not feare, Farewell then, farewell then, heauen keepe our loue alway. FINIS. Coridons Complaint. Phillida where hast thou bin? Long it is since I haue seene my Phillida. Euery eeu'n when day was doon, In the absence of the sunne, haue we met, my loue to sport and play. Now thy absence makes me feare, Coridon's not held so deare, of Philida. As he earst was wont to bee: Smile as thou wert wont on me, Phillida, my fairest Phillida. Coridon is now as true, As when first the heauenly hew, of Phillida. Made him all-admiring stand, And did loue and life command, Phillida, my fairest Phillida. Such sad dumps thy absence breeds, That my Pipe of Oaten Reeds, faire Phillida, I lay by, and sighing sit: Sorrow sighes, and teares beget. Phillida, my fairest Phillida. With thee I can play and sing, And mine armes shall, like a ring, faire Phillida Circle thee: and then I hold, That's more desir'd of me then gold. Phillida, my fairest Phillida. But without thee still I say, I, in woe weare time away, my dearest loue: Therefore let thy kind reply Cure me, or I faint and dye. Phillida, let not thy fancy mooue. FINIS. Phyllidaes kind replye. Wherefore faints my Coridon? Thinkes thou I am such a one, as Cressida? I will prooue as firme to thee, As Lucrece or Penelope, Coridon doubt not of Phillida. Though I haue been absent long, Faint not my sweet Coridon: thy Phillida Is, as thou art, true and iust, Strong in loue, but weake in lust. Coridon doubt not of Phillida. Nor, though our sex are giuen to range, Doth Phillida delight in change, my Coridon: If my absence made thee greeue, Let my presence now releeue Coridon, my deerest Coridon. As in me thou takest delight, So do I in thy sweete sight, my Coridon: I haue bene in yonder groue, Gathering flowers for my loue: Coridon my dearest Coridon. The chiefest both for shew and sent, So choice am I for thy content, my dearest loue: Looke, the liuery of the spring, to deck thee Coridon I bring, then do not thy Phillida reprooue. Such a louing simphathy, in our loues (deare loue) doth lye: I know right well. Such a heart wrought combination, that I feare no separation: Coridon such needlesse doubts repell, FINIS. A New sonnet of a Knight and a faire Virgin. To the tune of Salengers round. I read how in King Arthurs time, a Knight as he did ride: Did meet a Uirgin faire and bright, about the greenewood side. Could she well or could she wo, he lighted of his steed: And there he tooke against her will, her maiden head indeed. When this was done this maiden then, went raging to the King: Bewailing of her pitteous case, and told him euery thing: The King now hearing her complaint, in Stories as I read, Commanded the Knight he should be hangd, for this his hainous deed: The Queene alas considering this, it was a pitteous thing: To cast away so faire a man, she begd him of the King. Unto the Knight then she began, now prisoner art thou mine: For thou shalt dye for ought I know, except thy wittes are fine. Yet I will giue thee a whole yeares space, to know of woemens kind: What thing it is that woemen loue best, if they may haue their mind. Full sadly went this Knight away, some councell for to find, To know the cause, to keepe the day, that was to him assign'd. When that the yeare was almost out, he came where he had seene: Twenty Ladies in a rout, all dancing on a greene. When he drew neere vnto the place, his Question to haue told: They vaded all before his face, saue one that was ful old. Amaz'd be yee sir Knight quoth she, what ist that you mislike: Perchance you may pick out of me, the thing that you do seeke. He told her then, she said againe, if I do it for you: You must agree to grant it me, that you may easily doe. Content quoth he, come on quoth she, haue with you to the Queene: And say that it is Soueraignty, that women loue as I weene. Onward they go, the Queene did know the Knight was neere at hand, She placed her Ladies all on a row, to heare the matter scand. The Knight he gaue his question this, my tale was soone exprest: It seemes to me, that Soueraigntie, is that that women loue best. The Ladies all about the hall, their verdits soone did giue: This worthy Knight, hath hit so right, hath well deserued to liue. Then Beldam stept before the Queene, desiring that the Knight: Might grant to her vpon the greene, the troth that he did plight. What is that quoth he, mary quoth shee, that I may bee your wife: Alas quod he, then woe is mee, yet rather take my life. There was no shift, but marriage swift, and both laid in a bed: When she did ioy to prooue a toy, he turned away his head. Sir quoth she, were not you better haue me, being both shrewd and old: Then to haue youth, that for a truth, should make you a Cuckold. But all this while she saw no smile, nor countenance of the Knight: She changed hew, she made her selfe new, her beauty was braue and bright. Then fell the Knight to louers delight, good Lord what dayes are these. It was so strange to see the change, a could not sleepe for fleas. FINIS. A new song of an Hostisse and her Guests. To the tune of the painter. I wil not to Saint Katherines goe, to laugh no more: My Hostisse chides and checks me so, I am sorry therefore. When I came in as merry as a pye: she hung the chin, she lookt awry. She hould, she scould, she looked so coy, I could not be merry I could not ioy. I saw her sit so maidenly, when I came in: To busse and kisse her curtuously, I did begin. The more I shewed my countenance free, the more beshrewed, the worse was she: Her talke so shrill, the time so soure, I durst not tarry there halfe an hower. The beere was bitter for my tast, I tell you true: I came to soone to make such hast, as did ensue Yet after all these comely shewes, as best becomes those friendly shrewes: The frownes were gone, and frollick she, contented was to welcome me. Then had we chat and cheere at will, as serued the place. A redy friend our pots to fill, and fetch apace. The Goodman he was not at home, the guests were cut ouer heart and come: The shrew became a curteous dame. The three hoop'd pot was filled round, for lack of cheere: A neats-foot in the towne was found, and we drew neere. To take our fill of euery ioy, our Hostisse was no longer coy: But thankes be to God our friends and vs, our mallice and all was ended thus, Finis. A Lamentable Ditty on the death of a nobleman who was executed in the time of King Edward. Should fortune frowne against the Gods, alas and should she so: Should worthy wightes of noble blood, receiue such mortall woe: Alas poore England now alas, Thy wo wil shortly come to passe, In time of noble Edwards raigne, whose fame doth farre resound: His vncle deare did truth maintaine, and all his foes confound, But in the end alas alas, his wofull death was brought to passe, His Princely name and courage stout, which all men may report: Could not defend him from the rout, of those that did extort. But in the end alas alas, his wofull death was brought to passe. He was bereft of noble power, committed to his charge: And cast into the prison Tower, his torments to enlarge: Where as he lay alas alas, to dolefull death was brought to passe. Who then did know the faigned clause, wherefore he was condemned, Is not the sentence of those lawes, of all good men commended: O noble Duke alas alas, thy wofull death is come to passe. How wast thou led vnto Tower-hill, with billes beset about: Euen like a lambe contented still, before the wooluish rout. O Summerset alas alas, thy wofull death is come to passe. How did the Common people cry, with heaped voyces shril: Pardon pardon with hands on high, hoping to keepe him still. He stood vpright a noble Duke, with constant courage bold: Content your selues this was his sute, the lawes haue me controld. Alas poore soules alas alas, your wo wilt shortly come to passe. Pray for the peace of Edward King, your Soueraigne he did say: That he may prosper in liuing, all ye good people pray. Least that his foes alas alas, do bring his wofull death to passe. Our Summer sweet was thus bereft, and winter did ensue: What carefull hearts to vs were left: are since approoued true. Oh England cry alas alas, that thy woe should come thus to passe. Finis. A pleasant new Sonnet intituled, mine owne deare Lady braue To the tune of Rogero Myne owne deare Lady braue, would God it were my hap: To be the Spanniell that you haue, to dandle in your lap. Or that I were so feate, to please you with my skippes: To take me vp in your conceit, to stand and lick your lippes: Or that my pranking pace, in all points could agree: To touch your traine in euery place, at least as neere as he. Or that I could so bragge, or simper with my taile: To take me vp into your lap, to know what I doe ayle. Then should I hope and haue, each dainty in the dish. And harbor like a pretty knaue, according to my wish. And sleepe betweene your paps, with striking on the head: As tenderly each Lady raps, such puppies in their beds. Would God you would voutchsafe, to grant me halfe the grace: A lick or leape some time to haue, in such a puppies place. Should neuer faining whelpe, so closely keepe you play: For I will neither yaune nor yelpe, your secrets to bewray. But what it should behooue, A Spaniell to professe: To cloake or hide, when you remooue, my part shall be no lesse. And what doth want in him, my fauor might supply: For though your puppie can do trim, yet not so well as I. Perhaps you will forget, your puppies dainty toyes, When you and I were closely met, to play for pritty boyes. Then pitty now peruse, this written verse of mine: Or else the Dog I craue to choose, the happy state of thine. FINIS. A new Sonnet, of a curst wife and her husband. Passing along through Redriffe, I heard one sore complaining: Then streight I drew me neere to him, to know the cause and meaning. Of this his sorrow, care and griefe, which did his minde disaster: Alasse sayes he what shall I doe, my wife will needs be maister. For I may bid wo worth the time, that ere with her I matched: For with her nailes that are so sharpe, my face she hath bescratched. To a Surgion I was driuen to run, for to goe beg a plaister: So thus God knowes vnto my greefe, my wife will be my maister. I drudge I droile I tosse I toyle, till that the day be ended: At night I make to her account, what monny I haue spended. Or else my pockets she will search, and say I am a waster: Thus like a mome I liue at home, and she will needes be maister. For all the paines that I do take, yet still she will be chiding: Except fiue groats each night I bring, at home thers no abiding. She saies that I am good for nought, but for some foolish Ieaster: With angry browes and deadly vowes, she sweares to be my master. Thus honnest friend as you haue heard, I daily liue in sorrow: Of neuer a neighbor that I haue, dare I once lend or borrow. If I should liue as many yeares, as euer did King Nestor: Yet in my mind it still me feares, that she would be my maister. I dare not stir forth of her sight, but when I am a working: For her iealous mind doth thinke I am, with one or other lurking. And if at any time I should, but chance to spend a teaster: Sheele call me knaue, base rogue and slaue. and sweares sheele bee the maister. FINIS.</field>
