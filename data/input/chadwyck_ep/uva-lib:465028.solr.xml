      <field name="fulltext">TO W. TAYLOR, JUNIOR, OF NORWICH, THESE POEMS, THE OFFERING OF AN EARLY AND UNINTERRUPTED FRIENDSHIP, ARE DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. Pandora, a Monodrama. Jam signa ruendi His dedit ? confusaque rursus Natura timet. Claudian. Pandora passing from heaven to earth. How my heart throbs with joy—a hand divine Has form'd these finished limbs; celestial fire Darts thro' my veins; the choicest gifts of gods Are pour'd upon me—can I e'er forget Their splendid council in the flame-tipp'd clouds, When first from Vulcan's touch I sprang to life, And dazzled shrunk before their blaze of glory? Aloft, on golden throne, great Jove was seated; O'er his broad front the clustering tresses fell, And mildly beam'd his eyes—arise, ye gods, His awful voice exclaim'd, arise, and shed Your richest blessings on Pandora's form: He spake; majestic from his side arose The queen of heaven; around thy steps she cried, Shall float a stately grace—With roses crown'd, The laughter-loving Venus next advanc'd, Light as the summer breeze, and smiling said, O'er thy fair cheeks I cast a crimson tint, Thy melting eyes shall swim in softest lustre, Thy swelling breasts be moulded to the form Of Hebe's cup, be white as drifted snow— And while she spake, a thousand odours rose, A thousand sportive loves, brisk fluttering round, Fann'd the warm air—The god with golden locks Then came—be eloquent as fair, he cried, For what avails the radiance of thine eyes, The blossoms of thy cheek, if honied words Dwell not upon thy lips?—thy speech shall fall Soft as the dews of eve; then circling gods Press'd on me to bestow their varied honours; Enough, cried Jove, she's perfect—take this casket Fast bound in glittering ribs, and bear it hence To where Prometheus 'bides—beware, O nymph, To ope its silver clasps—I bow'd obedient— This casket!—is Prometheus then so lov'd? Daring Prometheus?—from the fiery cope He stole forbidden flames—the vulture tore His bleeding heart—and do the gods reward him? To him they doom Pandora; doom to him The rare device this adamant enfolds. Why is it thus?—what enviable gift Is here contain'd?—not look at it!—O Jove, Where was the goddess of the tinted arch, Thy wonted messenger?—why, to my hands Consign the prize?—perchance the god was sportive, And wish'd to try me—'t is an empty casket— Or if 't is not, its secret store, perhaps, Would prove to me a bane—I'll think no more of 't— How broad the way, 't is trac'd with milky beams— Lo there's the earth, it floats in circling air, Its towering hills are tipp'd with steady light; In yon dark shades, the billowy waters lurk; Once huge and shapeless, now a viewless mind Has mov'd its jarring atoms, rang'd its forms, And o'er its fertile surface, scatter'd wide The glow of life—ah! how I long to stray Amid its flowery vales—there quiet dwells— No more the giant arms high heap the mountains To reach this starry bridge, no more the lightnings Flash horribly around—all, all, is peace— I soon shall reach it—how the fam'd Prometheus Will gaze enamour'd on my youthful charms. What?—can Jove send him too a nobler gift Than fair Pandora?—sure the casket holds Ambrosial food—that makes the gods immortal— Would I could taste it!—nay, 't is poison rather— O deep revenge! and thus to snatch Prometheus, Delighted, from my arms—it cannot be— Jove bade me bless the earth, he bade me rear A blooming offspring—would he slay my husband? Ah! were it thus?—I'll ope it—shall I thwart The dread commands of heaven?—some dire distress Would fall upon me—Think what dreadful woes Prometheus suffer'd—think what endless pangs Torment the Titans—theirs were crimes indeed— But what is this?—Among the other gods I well remember Mars; he cast upon me A furious look; be bold, he cried, O maid, Be bold above thy sex—and now's the time— O'er the vast sky a solemn silence broods; No eye beholds me; I've already pass'd The monsters of the air, the fiery archer, The flaming goat, the writhing serpent's folds; Whate'er the casket holds it cannot 'scape me— What if it 'scapes, and Jove should know my guilt? Sure this all-perfect form, these smiles of love, The touching accents of my rosy lips, May win forgiveness from the thunderer's self— Yes, yes, the god expects my disobedience— I tremble still—assist me, Mars—'t is done! [Opening the casket. What!—empty!—empty!—yet methought a wind, As of a thousand rushing wings, blew swift Athwart my face—ah me! what grisly forms Float in the air—see, see, they grimly smile, And mocking, point at me—speak, speak, who are ye? [A voice from the air. Thanks to her who gave us birth; Eager sailing to the earth, We haste to act the deeds of woe, And prey on all that breathes below. PANDORA. Ah me! who are ye?—wretched, wretched woman! [The voice continues. Bloody strife, and knawing Care, Pride, and Hatred, and Despair, Hover o'er thee in the air; We haste to act the deeds of woe, And prey on all that breathes below. PANDORA. What have I done?—hush, hush, a softer sound! [Another voice from the air. Hear, thou luckless maiden, hear, Cease thy sorrow, cease thy fear, Tho' yon grim troop on mortal shore Haste the tide of grief to pour, Hope shall join the gloomy throng, Hope shall breathe her cheering song, And bending o'er the troubled heart, Gently steal the poison'd dart, Hope shall bid the tempest cease, And whisper future hours of peace. ARIADNE. (From an Epithalamium by Catullus.) The lofty pines are torn from Pelion's steep, And stately floating o'er the gleamy deep, Bear to Ætæan shores and Phasis' strand The Argive youth, a vigorous, dauntless band; Braving the surge, and mocking every toil, They nobly dare to snatch the golden spoil; A favouring goddess sends the prosperous breeze, And wafts them smoothly o'er the untried seas; Soon as the swift keel trac'd its foamy way, And bending oars dash'd high the glittering spray, The wondering sea-gods rais'd their dewy brows, And Nereids, trembling, from their caves arose; Then first to human sight expos'd they stood, Their lovely forms half-bending o'er the flood; Peleus enraptur'd, gaz'd on Thetis' charms, And clasp'd a yielding goddess in his arms. Hail! heaven-sprung heroes, born in happiest days! Long in my verse shall live your well-earn'd praise, Thou, chief—Thessalia's bulwark and her pride, To whom e'en Jove resign'd a splendid bride, Dooming, reluctant, to thy fond embrace, The fairest daughter of the sea-god race— See from the east bright shoots the roseate ray, And laughing hours lead on the nuptial day; Nor Grecian towers, nor Tempe's shades, detain The jocund myriads; o'er Thessalia's plain They press, with eager joy, their chief to greet, And pour their costly offerings at his feet; The fields deserted give to welcome peace The tired steer; the rattling arrows cease; The plough-share rusts unheeded, and the oak No longer trembles to the woodman's stroke; Lost in delight, amid the regal domes, The revel crowd forget their humble homes; The gold's deep lustre, and the silvery beam Shoot thro' the lofty halls a blended gleam; The glistening ivory decks the throne of state; The gorgeous table shines with massy plate; But far above the rest, the nuptial bed Of Tyrian dye, with splendid coverings spread: The rich embroidery tells of heroes' deeds, Of fierce encounters, and of virtue's meeds— Entranc'd in woe, see Ariadne stand, Alone, abandon'd, on the sea-dash'd strand; Fresh from her couch, where floating dreams of night Had spread their painted visions to her sight, She fondly trusts that still they mock her view, And scarce believes her misery is true; Mean time her lover, hastening from the shore, Skims the green waves, and plies the dripping oar; Fix'd to the earth, she views, with streaming eyes, The distant sail, and deeper pangs arise; The glittering fillet of her golden hair, Her thin-spun veil, light dancing in the air, The slender zone, her snowy breast that binds, Fall at her feet, the sport of eddying winds; Nor veil, nor zone attract her fixed sight, Deep plung'd in grief, she marks but Theseus' flight; With him her soul still strives the waves to ride, Cleaves to his lips, and lingers by his side. Thrice wretched-woman! hated be the hour When first thy lover trod the Cretan shore! When first, self-doom'd, he fearless rush'd to save The youth of Athens from th' untimely grave. In Minos' glittering courts the hero stands, A towering god amidst his vigorous bands, Fair Ariadne sees him, sees and loves, O'er every charm her youthful fancy roves, Her heart drinks deep th' intoxicating fire Of giddy passion, and of warm desire. Fair son of Venus, dear, tormenting boy, Who light'st, 'mid human woes, the lamp of joy; How couldst thou, cruel, plunge so deep thy dart, And triumph fiercely o'er a virgin heart? Soft is the lustre of her pensive eyes, Her labouring bosom heaves with frequent sighs, Her hurried slumbers unknown terrors break, And livid paleness creeps across her cheek; But most, when Theseus braves the doubtful fight, Her sinking spirits sicken with affright, To every aiding god, in deep despair, She vows her gifts, and breathes the silent prayer— Her prayer is heard—As raging storm-winds sweep The pine uprooted, from the rocky steep, Dash the firm oak to earth, and rapid bear Its twisted branches in the whirling air: Thus, with resistless force, the youth assails The blood-stain'd monster; now no more avails The chilling terror of his hideous form; He bends, he flies before the impetuous storm: In vain he flies; the hero swift pursues, With glowing heart th' auspicious fight renews, With sinewy arm quick ends the glorious strife, The monster falls, and groaning, yields his life; Thro' the dark maze the victor tracks his way, And the thin clue restores him to the day— But let us turn from scenes of brighter hue, Nor tell how swift the golden minutes flew, Whilst Ariadne, borne to Naxos' shore, Liv'd but to love, till that detested hour, When the false youth forsook his blooming bride, And broke the sacred bonds that love had tied. From her pale lips indignant accents burst, Whilst her heart shudder'd at the deed accurs'd; Now with fleet step, she climbs the mountain brow, And wistful gazes on the deep below; Now wildly rushes 'midst the weltering surge, And calls on Theseus from the ocean's verge; Dash'd by the frothy waves, forlorn and faint, Mix'd with deep sobs, she breathes the fond complaint: “Perfidious man! for thee I left my home, “Faithful to follow where thy steps should roam, “For thee forsook a tender mother's arms, “And blushing, doom'd to thee my virgin charms; “Could no soft ties that cruel bosom move? “No fond endearments win thy constant love? “Was it for this thy solemn vows were sworn? “Vows that are now become thy jest, thy scorn? “Fondly I hop'd, to Hymen's temple led “By sportive trains, to share thy nuptial bed— “But every hope and every joy is dead— “Base is thy sex, ye woo but to betray, “Nor oaths, nor gods impede your daring way, “Still, still ye flatter, till enjoyment cloys, “And the false tale that won us, then destroys; “But thou art doubly base—'t was I who spar'd “Thy life, thy glory—what is my reward? “For this thou leav'st me on a desert land, “Lingering to perish, where no pious hand “The last sad duties to my corse shall pay— “Of wolves, of vultures I am doom'd the prey. “Ah! did a Libyan tygress give thee birth? “Or raging ocean cast thee upon earth? “Whence, whence thy monster-race, that thus repays “The gift of life? the boon of happy days? “What if, obedient to thy sire's command, “Thou fear'dst to lead me to thy native land, “Thy wife confess'd; ah! why for ever leave “Her who had follow'd as thy humblest slave? “Her to whom every office had been dear, “That serv'd thy wants to ease, thy life to cheer? “But why unheeded to the wandering air “Thus pour my woes, and breathe the fruitless prayer? “Far o'er the swelling waves the bark is fled, “And all around is desolate and sad; “Denied to me the wretch's last relief, “Unheard I mourn, unpitied sink in grief. “Thou potent god! ah! would thy thundering hand “Had dash'd the traitorous vessel on the strand; “Would the deceitful youth, who veil'd by art, “By graces veil'd the treachery of his heart, “Had sunk unheeded in the heaving sea, “Nor doom'd this faithful breast to misery!— “Where shall I turn me? see, the wide-spread main “For ever bars me from the Cretan plain, “Or would a parent's arms receive a child, “Lost to all shame, by kindred blood defil'd? “No, wretch—go seek thy faithful lover's breast, “Fall at his feet, and sue to be caress'd— “Distracting thought!—where'er my eyes are cast, “No hope is seen—the hour of joy is past; “Thick o'er my heart increasing horrors roll, “And death alone can calm my struggling soul; “But ere these limbs shall fail in wild affright, “Ere my dim eyes shall close in endless night, “I hail the furies with a holy dread, “And call down vengeance on the perjurer's head.”— She ceas'd—in wrath th' appalling sisters rise, Jove bows assent, and rocks the solid skies; Earth trembles, ocean heaves, and heaven's bright flames Quivering confirm the mandate he proclaims. ODE TO MORNING. Bright is the eastern sky—Aurora mounts In car dew-dropping, round her snowy breast The rosy radiance plays And sparkles o'er the deep. Hence, dreary darkness, to the caves of death, Hence, ye fell ghosts, whose fearful shapes have sail'd Across my lonely couch, When blackest midnight reign'd. Bring me the lyre, and while I strike the chords Strew odorous flowers around—hail! goddess, hail! Hail to the living ray Which gilds the dusky earth! For thee the purple violet breathes its sweets, For thee the streaked blossoms fragrant bud, And balmy breezes waft Their grateful scents around; Nor scorn the suppliant Muse's song of praise, Whose notes of thrilling sound have floated oft Athwart the dark-blue sky, And charm'd the listening gods; But who, O goddess, fairest of thy race, Who, beauteous mother of the shining day, Can praise in equal strains Thy form of heavenly mould? Before those blushing cheeks, those glittering locks, The yellow-twinkling stars abash'd retreat, The fading moon retires And shuns thy splendid step; From shades of gloomy night thy beams awak'd The mortal race, wide-shooting o'er the land They dy'd with varied light The-many tinted flowers; Thou, goddess, from the languid closed eye, Driv'st heavy sleep, the hated kin of death, And active man again Pursues his wonted joys. The traveller starts, and briskly plies his steps, The ploughman drives his vigorous team afield, The jocund shepherd's care Swift hastens to the plain. The buskin'd goddess and her fleet-limb'd nymphs O'er the moist lawn swift chase the reeking stag, And cheer the panting hounds, With loud and joyful shout. To some the dull still hours of night are dear, To me the cheerful day, fair queen of morn, O give me oft to view Thy purple-streaming light. ODE TO NIGHT. Hither, O queen of silence, turn the steeds, The slow-pac'd steeds that draw thy ebon car, And heave athwart the sky Thy starry-studded veil. Come not with all thy horrors clad, thy heaps Of threat'ning, pitchy clouds, thy wasteful blasts, Which howling o'er the deep, High swell the boisterous surge. Far be the fearful forms that round thee float! The owl shrill-shrieking, and the flitting bat, And every ghastly shape That frighten'd fancy spies! But come with peaceful step, and o'er the land, Parch'd by the sultry sun, thy coolness breathe, And shed thy summer mists Upon the with'ring herb. Let all be still—save the sweet note of her Who warbles to thy steps, and the faint sound Of yon tall trees, that bend Before thy swelling breeze. Or, from the distant mountain, whose huge crags Are pil'd to heaven, let echo feebly send The falling water's roar, Across the wide-spread lake. Then will I hasten to the firm-built tower, And climb its winding steps, and from the top, Gaze with a deep delight On heaven's bright-burning fires; While from the Northern verge of ether shoot The flickering tides of ever-changing light, Now rolling yellow streams, Now ting'd with glary red. Pleas'd will I trace the meteor of the vale, Which, smoothly sliding thro' its shining path, Sinks in its swampy bed, And dims its fires in mist. Descending, thro' the dewy fields I'll stray, Where on the grass the quiet herds are stretch'd, Mixing their fragrant breath With freshen'd scents of flowers; Or, loitering on the brim of ocean, mark The pale beams dancing on its curled waves, While from the gleamy east The moon begins her course; Then slowly wandering to my peaceful home, I'll seek my silent couch, and floating dreams Shall feast my charmed soul With airy scenes of bliss.— EPIGRAM ON A SWALLOW BEARING A GRASSHOPPER TO HER YOUNG. (From the Greek.) Ah, Attic maid, who from the fragrant flower Drink'st honied juice! ah, minstrel! dost thou bear, To feast the callow younglings of thy bower, The brisk and gaily-chirping grasshopper? What? shall the songster seize a vocal prey? The winged seek the winged for her food? The stranger snatch her fellow-guest away? The child of summer tear the summer-brood? Dost thou not drop him?—O, 't is cruel, base, When poets suffer by the poet race. ODE TO BACCHUS. (From the Thesmophoriazusæ of Aristophanes, l. 996.) Bacchus, ivy-waving king, Lead me thro' the mystic ring, Gladly catch my shouts of glee, And songs that waken revelry! Son of Semele, advance, Bromius, lead me in the dance!— On mountain-heights thou lov'st to stray, And guide thy loudly-jocund train, While nymphs around thee chant their lay, Thou swell'st the shout and frolic strain; Echo, from her quivering shell, Rocks, o'er tufted woods that tower, The dark-brow'd hill, the bending dell, Scatter wide the festive roar. O thou, with bright-leav'd ivy crown'd, While song and gladness burst around, Son of Semele, advance, Bromius, lead me in the dance. THE SONG OF DANAE. (From Simonides.) Loud roar'd the wind—the richly-carved chest, By mountain waves was wildly borne along, Her infant Perseus Danae gently press'd, And weeping, trembling, thus began her song. “Alas! my child, what countless woes I bear, Whilst thy young heart is calm'd by sweetest sleep; Toss'd in the cheerless ark thro' misty air, And moon-beams faintly playing o'er the deep. Peaceful thou sleep'st, nor heed'st the howling wind, Nor waves that o'er thy ringlets dash their spray; Half-smiling still, on purple vest reclin'd, Those blooming features sooth my wild dismay. Ah! could'st thou tell—but no—thy mother's breast Would then be tortur'd by a keener grief— Sleep on, my child—ye waves too, sink to rest— Sleep, sleep, my woes, and grant some short relief. Vain be the counsels of those haughty powers, Whose wrath my boundless suffering cannot shake; Save me, protecting Jove, for happier hours, O save the mother for her infant's sake!” EPIGRAM. [Who hangs a garland on the rose?—] (From Paulus Silentiarius.) Who hangs a garland on the rose?— How idle then the 'broidered vest, And studded fillet on thy brows, And pearls that fade upon thy breast; Twine not with gold thy glossy hair, That floats, uncheck'd, in lovelier swell; And scorn the gorgeous gem to bear, Whose beam thy sparkling eyes excel. Those dewy lips, that matchless grace, No borrow'd lustre can enhance; Trembling, thy potent charms I trace— But sweet hope lingers in thy glance. TO THE GRASSHOPPER. (From Anacreon.) Ever-happy child of spring, On the summit of yon tree, Sipping dew, thou sitt'st a king, Chanting loud notes merrily; Thine is all that nature yields, All the smiling hours display; Harmless tenant of the fields, Safely pass thy frolic day; Herald sure of summer skies, Friend to man, to muses dear, Phœbus' self to thee supplies Sportive chirpings, shrill and clear; Age to thee no terror bears, Well-taught lover of the song, Thy slender, dew-fed form no passion tears, Thou earth-born brother of th' immortal throng! EPIGRAM. [Blest is the cup from which my Cynthia sips!] (From the Greek.) Blest is the cup from which my Cynthia sips! Thrice blest, to press the roses of her lips! Ah! would she fervent join those lips to mine, And drink my soul in such a kiss divine. EPIGRAM. [Graces must hold, though beauty first may gain] (From the Greek.) Graces must hold, though beauty first may gain; Without the hook, the bait but floats in vain. ODE. [Flush'd with bloming beauty's pride] (From Anacreon.) Flush'd with bloming beauty's pride, Fly not, fly not, lovely maid, The waving silver of my head, No more my gentle vows deride. Mark how pleasing to the sight, The chequer'd chaplet on my brow! Mark how the blushing roses glow, Twin'd with the lily's glistening white! A WAR SONG. Fingal, surrounded by a numerous army of the enemy, in a valley from which he had no prospect of escape, unexpectedly perceived on the tops of the mountains the troops of his friends, advancing to his relief: at this period the song begins. High o'er the hills the banners wave in air; A band of heroes stalk in armed pride; With Erin's gold the shining streamers glare, Revenge! revenge! the starting Fingal cried. Lo! their glittering flags I spy, The dark-hair'd sons of victory; Now the boaster's pride is low— Deeply strike th' avenging blow. 'T is Dermod's colt!—he breathes dismay, Strong-arm'd warriors, feast no more— Dermod's banners foremost play When the streams of battle roar; Now the boaster's pride is low— Deeply strike th' avenging blow. See!—the gore-stain'd eagle rose, Fierce the host that Chialt leads Scattering heads of flying foes Bloody thro' the fight he speeds; Now the boaster's pride is low— Deeply strike th' avenging blow. Who is next?—the dark-brow'd king Drifting heaper of the slain, When the thickening weapons ring, Last shall Oscar's hand refrain; Now the boaster's pride is low— Deeply strike th' avenging blow. Lo! the son of Morni's near, When the hosts of fight are mix'd, When the green earth quakes for fear, Firm his nervous foot is fix'd; Now the boaster's pride is low— Deeply strike th' avenging blow. Enough, enough, too much for thee, On the dark-brown hills I see, They come, they come, the warlike trains, Drag nine weighty golden chains, Nine hundred heroes at their head— I see the gazing foe a-dread. Before the hissing spear they flee As wreck along the dashing sea; Shouts of warriors rend the skies, Battle smiles—arise, arise— Now the boaster's pride is low— Deeply strike th' avenging blow. TO CYNTHIA. (From the Antholog. Lond.) How winning are those pearly drops That pity bids to flow! Soft o'er thy blooming cheek they glide, And wet thy breast of snow. Thus thro' the sweetly-scented vale, The lucid streamlet goes, And moistens with its glittering waves, The lily and the rose. And as when dews of eve descend To cool the scorched bower, Some joyful flutterer hovers round, And bathes him in the shower. So young Desire, amid thy tears, His silken pinions plies, And shakes his torch with playful hand, And brighter flames arise. TO CYNTHIA. What tho' I'm told that Flora's face Is flush'd with fresher tints than thine, That Chloe moves with nobler grace, That Laura's lightnings brighter shine; What tho' I'm told Zelinda's breast Is whiter than the mountain-snows, That Fulvia's lips, in dimples drest, Are sweeter than the summer-rose; For ever hanging on thy smile, To others' charms my soul is blind, What perfect form can him beguile, Who doats upon thy perfect mind? TO CYNTHIA. Ah! fly not, fly not, nymph belov'd, And shun these gazing eyes! Ah! can'st thou see, and see unmov'd, The starting tear arise? Shall not the deep-drawn sighs avail, With which this bosom swells? Wilt thou not hear the faltering tale That trembling passion tells? Think not that avarice moves my breast To woo thy golden stores, Think not thy rank, in splendour drest, Is what this heart adores. I scorn thy wealth, I scorn thy state, Nor prize the boasting vain, To snatch thee from the man I hate, A gayer, richer swain; These, these are joys of feeble power— Be Cynthia mine, I ask no more. INVITATION TO ? A FRAGMENT. Haste to thy friend, and from the mountain brow, High over-arching Cromer's pebbled shore, Trace ocean's varying hues, and mark the shades That chace each other o'er his dark-green breast In quick succession, floating with the clouds That cast the moving gloom; or watch the spread Of gathering storms, that heave across the sky Their widening night, while hollow-whistling winds Now swell, now sink, and rolls the blacken'd sea His hoarser surge—or heed the rippling showers That rattle o'er the deep, while airy forms Build on its waves the glittering bow of heaven; And when, behind yon wood-girt hills, the sun Has quench'd his fires, the sea-born flames shall flash, Glide thro' the wave, and sparkle on the strand. If these delight not, catch the purple beam Of sun-rise, tinging wide the mist of morn, And melting it to air—then brush along The flowery meadow, mark its native blooms, And glowing tints fresh-painted with the dew, While, from their lair, the full-ey'd, stately steers Slow-stretching rise, and scan with fixed look Thy stranger form, and breathe their balmy steam. Or seek the bristly corn-field, jocund there, The low-bent mowers ply the hissing scythe In cadence not unpleasing; with their task, The tale, the laugh is mix'd; and bend thy steps To yon fleet brook, amid whose shining waves The countless shoals wheel swift, upturning oft Their polish'd sides, and dart the flickering gleam Of silver light—when evening slowly dims With softest shade, the glary light of day, When dark clouds, gold-tipp'd, cross the crimson sky, And rear in air an awful, radiant throne For shapes unseen, and through the reeking vale The calm, deep flood of yellow light is pour'd, Then pensive wander to the twilight still Of Felbrigg's oaks, for there thy mind shall feed On heaven-born thought— ODE TO A FLY. Gay child of summer, who, on burnish'd wings, Unceasing ply'st thy brisk and mazy flight, Tasting with rapture all that nature flings Profusely round—still courting new delight; Come, in thine airy dance, and freely sip The clear juice sparkling to my thirsty lip; And wheeling sportive o'er my tempting board, Cull the red nectarine for thy luscious meal, Or from the peach its pulp of fragrance steal, And calmly rifle autumn's choicest hoard. Then buzzing haste thee to the sunny field, Or drink the perfume that the moorlands yield; Or swiftly to some flowery vale repair, There jocund float adown the dimpling stream, And meet thy brethren in the setting beam, And bathe thy ebon sides in purple air. While thoughtless sailing on the scented gale, Beware you slimy threads, the woof of death, The speckled spider will empierce thy mail, And quench thy spirit with his tainted breath. O, may no tempest shade thy mirthful day, Nor dash those filmy wings with whelming rain! O, may no feather'd foe molest thy way, And fluttering bear thee to his infant train! May no fierce inmate of the curled brook, While o'er his head thou speed'st thy circling flight, Snatch thee unheeding to his watery nook, And ruthless force thee from the chearful light. Long, long may summer lengthen out thy year, And spare a life so bright with varied joy, A little life, that glides uncheck'd by fear, Tho' chilling winter hovers to destroy. How different man—he forms the lowering cloud Of gloomy care his happier hours to shroud, Fixing on doubtful ill his restless eye; How wiser far, like thee, with gladsome heart, To catch the transport Nature's gifts impart, And frolic fearless of futurity. SONNET. TO A COTTAGE. Well pleas'd I mark thy modest, straw-crown'd roof, The luscious woodbine that o'ertwines its brow, And yon thick rose-buds' crimsom-tinted glow— And fancy whispers that, tho' far aloof From all that madding crowds so fondly prize, Within thy humble walls I'd joy to live In deepest calm; for I could well despise All but the bliss which tenderest love would give. Vain dream!—that bliss, alas! is ever dead; No more this fond heart feels its soothing powers, With her, the angel-traitress, far it fled, And melancholy marks my lonely hours— Vain then the peaceful cot—fair nature's calm On wounds like mine can pour no healing balm. SONNET. TO RELIGION. Spirit most pure, who through the darkling air Point'st the rich sapphire of eternal day, Long have I sighing pac'd my lonely way, The child of woe and heart-consuming care. O lift from earth to heaven my languid eye! Teach me to deem alike each joy, each pain Of mortal coil but fleeting, empty, vain; Guide to that hope which peers above the sky. And still should torturing memory love to tell Of past delight, no more the tale I'll fear, Thy smile serene shall check each rising tear, And passion's giddy gusts no more shall swell; My calmed soul shall spurn her dark abode, Soaring to meet her father, friend, and God. SONNET. [In vain doth Grandeur, trick'd in gorgeous pall] In vain doth Grandeur, trick'd in gorgeous pall, Stalk stately by, and point to glittering joys; In vain doth Mammon spread his gilded toys, To lure a careless wight to bitter thrall; In vain doth loudly-laughing Pleasure call To loose delights and days of mirthful noise; Hence, hated fiends!—me gentle Peace accoys; Her cup is heavenly sweet, undash'd with gall; Yblest in her, with slow and secret tread, I wander, loitering, in the arched grove, Fancy's gay dreams aye dancing round my head; There jolly elves at midnight nimbly move Their dainty feet; and shades of mighty dead Glide pale across my path. Such scenes the muses love. SONNET. [Ah, wretched man! whom Fame shall tempt to leave] Ah, wretched man! whom Fame shall tempt to leave The soft and silent valley of Repose, And with her deeply-stirring voice deceive To deeds of thankless toil, and weary woes; Ah! wretched man! who stays ne to perceive The thorns that threat'ning gird the peerless rose; But hopes unharm'd he may a wreath receive Of deathless flowerets to surround his brows— Look up!—afore the beamy towers of Fame, What fell and ghastly fiends for ever wait; Envy, whose baleful vipers none can tame, And Disappointment of slow, sullen gait, And with her eyes abash'd, heart-damping Shame; Fly, fly to fair Repose, nor scorn so sweet a mate. THE DYING AFRICAN. Tune—Son of Alknomoak. On my toil-wither'd limbs sickly languors are shed, And the dark mists of death o'er my eye-lids are spread; Before my last sufferings how gladly I bend, For the strong arm of death is the arm of a friend. Against the hot breezes hard struggles my breast, Slow, slow, beats my heart, and I hasten to rest; No longer shall anguish my faint bosom rend, For the strong arm of death is the arm of a friend. No more shall I sink in the deep-scorching air, No more shall sharp hunger my weak body tear, No more on my limbs shall keen lashes descend, For the strong arm of death is the arm of a friend. Ye ruffians, who tore me from all I held dear, Who mock'd at my wailings, and smil'd at my tear, Now, now shall I 'scape—every torture shall end, For the strong arm of death is the arm of a friend. SONNET. [Tho' manly ardour in thy bosom glows] Tho' manly ardour in thy bosom glows While Freedom's banners wave on Gallia's plain, While Freedom's clarion sounds th' inspiring strain, And millions, starting from a base repose, Sweep from their sickening land the oppressive woes Of slavery's gloomy desolating reign, And fiercely bursting from the despot's chain Dash from the haughty throne their tyrant foes; Amidst the tempest's howl and wild uproar Ere yet the shatter'd nation sinks to rest, Cast a fond look on Britain's peaceful shore Nor chace her blessings from thy kindling breast. Here soft affection spreads her grateful store, And friendship calls thee where no storms molest. SONNET, 1803. (In a late fashionable and highly-finished style.) TO A WEEPING WILLOW. Ah me! I trace thy tendrils' sombrous sweep, O'er yon blue lake that streams with tinted light; Thy pensile locks, reflected on the steep, Wave their pale umbrage to my quivering sight. Say, did some love-lorn Dryad bid thee mourn, And stoop thy verdant head in sullen mood? Say, did some Naiad, pensive o'er her urn, Bend thee in sorrow to her silvery flood? Tho' sun-bath'd Nature sweetly laughs around, And cheers thy drooping film, fair queen of trees, Still art thou sad—I catch the dying sound, Wak'd in thy bosom by the billowy breeze. Alas! this woe-worn heart of misery Sighs to thy sighs, and fondly weeps with thee. SONNET, 1803. (In the present fashionable and truly simple style.) ON MY GREAT UNCLE, JOSEPH WIGGINS, ESQ. (Written at the age of eight and three quarters.) How I did love my dear great-uncle Joe, He was so good to me—upon his stick He'd make me ride a horse-back—oit, gee-o! O! he would teach me many a monkey trick. Full often would he give me half-pence bright, And stuff my pockets too with pippins sour; Did tart, or cake, attract my youthful sight, Uncle would pay for all I could devour. But he is gone—and I no half-pence see; Around the fruit-stall wistful still I go; Nor tart, nor cake alas! is made for me— I'll sit me down and weep for uncle Joe. But he will come not should I ever weep; No matter—I shall cry myself to sleep. TO CHAUCER. (As if by a contemporary writer.) Forsyth, for since Forsyth thowe beest the fyrst gode harpour wight That sang full swotilie in lefe lefe, dear Englonde, Thie galiard galiard, gay gle, gle, melody me doth to grete delite, And in low curtesie I kiss thie hond; Now thie queint leys leys, lays of stalwart stalwart, bold knightes do tell, Of gisarmes gisarme, a kind of halbert split, and haubergéons rivin, And now of monkes ystall'd in corven corven, carved cell, And now of wincing wives to daliaunce givin; Ronn nat ronn nat, cease not to glittern in the gergon throng, gergon prating But swell thie renomie at my behest, Certes, gode Geffray, eche shall con thie song, And leve leve, believe. eche song he conneth be thie best. ADDRESS TO A GOTHIC CHAIR, IN THE PRIORY OF BRACONDALE LODGE, NORFOLK. Et nunc servat honos sedem— Virgil. Yes, venerable chair! I surely prize Thy massy limbs, thy broad and towering back, Thy dark unfaded gloss, and carvings quaint, 'Bove all the seats that fickle fancy forms Of daintier trim. The ever-creaking cane, The light deal trick'd with many a gaudy tint, The tottering, 'broider'd stool, and such slim toys, Are but gay lackeys to thy majesty. Safe in thy solid sides, I love to roll My weary limbs—thy form of antique guise Flings o'er my mind a mystic, soothing charm; And then, in musing mood, I conjure up The scenes that pass'd beside thee—oft thou'st stood High at the festive board, amid the shouts Of hospitable mirth—in lofty hall, With blazons dight, and echoing to the din Of minstrelsy and song, thy liberal lord From heart-of-oak has cheerly push'd around The wassail-bowl, and roar'd the welcome toasts Of good old English loyalty. And oft, To gentler duty doom'd, thou 'st foster'd well The patriarch of the house, who turn'd the page Of holy writ, and with right reverend grace, Taught to his blooming family around The words of endless Truth; with decent awe They listen to the lore, except, perchance, Some heedless prattler, youngest of the flock, Whom the scar'd mother, by her winks and frowns, Can scarcely chide to silence. Then, again, The grandsire crept to rest, some blushing girl Of slender mould, would glide into his seat, And slily view the ample space she leaves Unoccupied—nor is the hint disdain'd By the bold youth that woos her; briskly rising, He claims the vacant half, and spite of all Her feign'd denials, nestles by her side. In merrier sports too, ever-honour'd seat, Thou 'st surely play'd thy part—with foil and lace, With gems of glass, and many a checker'd wreath Of ribbands deck'd thou 'st form'd a splendid throne For him, the happy wight, whom chance pronounc'd The Twelfth-night king; in thee his mimic state He jocund held, whilst his gay court around Mix'd in the song, the dance, and gambols wild. But not thus fearless has thy stately form Been always view'd—the stern-brow'd Justice there Has held his seat; with beard of formal cut And velvet cap terrific, well he weigh'd The culprit's deeds of guilt; but loud reproof Was all he oft bestow'd, which scarce conceal'd The tide of mercy flowing in his heart. But much, I fear, alas! no scenes like these Have lately grac'd thee; hurl'd by scornful arm 'Midst mouldering trunks, and shreds, and portraits grim Of Aldermen and May'rs, thy sturdy limbs Were deeply shrouded in the garret's gloom— Blest be the hand that dragg'd thee back to light And wholesome air; restor'd thee to the state Thou well may'st claim; and doom'd thee, thus secure, To the still cell, congenial with thy form! ON TROWSE ORGAN. Fungar vice cotis acutum. Horace. I Whetstone, clerk of this good parish, Having no organs fit for singing, And wishing much my breath to cherish, Bought pipes to set the church a ringing. Now, though I ne'er could hum a stave, To some renown I still aspire, For this brave organ which I gave, Is deem'd the Whetstone of the choir. ON THE SAME. Ned Whetstone to Trowse parish left, An organ which in giving, He thought that when of breath bereft, He'd make more noise than living. But fearing that if he should go, The choice might be ill-suited, He chose to live to witness how, His will was executed. TRANSLATION OF THE Cyclops of Euripides. PERSONS OF THE PLAY. Silenus. Ulysses. The Cyclops. Chorus of Satyrs. SCENE. SICILY. Caves at the foot of Mount Ætna. [Act 1] SILENUS. O Bacchus! what innumerable toils I suffer for thy sake—aye, and have suffer'd E'en from my earliest days—I well remember When first, by Juno madden'd, we forsook The mountain-nymphs, thy nurses—then again, Close by thy side, I fought the earth-born giants, And thro' the shield of fierce Enceladon Driving my spear, I slew him—softly—softly— Did I not dream all this?—by Jove, not I— 'T is fact—all fact—I shew'd the spoils to Bacchus— Now my fate's harder still—when Juno urg'd These Tyrrhene scoundrels to attack my master, And bear him off, I straitway sought a vessel, Took all my children with me, put to sea, And sail'd in quest of Bacchus—while I steer'd, My boys here row'd—the green sea foam'd around us; Passing by Malea, a wind sprang up, That drove us to these rocks—the rocks of Ætna— Here dwell the one-ey'd children of the god Who rules the sea—a bloody, monstrous race— Captur'd by Polypheme, for him we toil— No more we shout our god, but guard the herds Of this accursed Cyclops—on yon hill My sons now watch his flock—while I am doom'd To sweep his cave, to keep all clean within, To wait upon him at his impious meals— Come, I must now to work, and sweep, and scrape, That all be neat—what's this?—my sons approach, Driving their flocks—hark—hark,—does this resemble The Bacchanalian shout, the choral song Mingled with music in Althæa's hall? SEMI-CHORUS. Why, O flocks of noblest race, Why, across the barren rocks, So idly range? There no cooling breezes play, There no tempting herbage springs, There no curling eddies gush— Come to the dewy field, Come to your master's fold— SEMI-CHORUS. Soon the tender lambs shall press Your swelling dugs, Rouz'd from their slumbers, hark, they bleat And call their dams. Come to your master's fold, Come to the shady dell.— No songs of Bromius here resound, No Thyrsus-bearing crouds advance— Where are the revelling nymphs, And where the clattering drums Loud-echoing o'er the streams? CHORUS. I shout the Bromian lay; On Venus still I call, Venus, whom oft I've sought With Bacchus' sportive train— O friendly god, O dearest youth, Where is thy lonely seat? Where dost thou, mourning, shake Thy golden hair? Far from thy cheering looks, In coarsest garb I pine, The monster's slave.— SILENUS. Be silent, children; haste and drive your flocks Into the rocky caves. CHORUS. We will, my father, But why so urgent? SILENUS. Close upon the shore I see a Grecian galley, and its crew, Led by their captain, seem to bend their course This way—they're surely seeking food and water, They bear some empty vessels—wretched strangers! Who can they be?—alas! they cannot know The nature of our master—little think they That, landing on these hated shores, they come The self-doom'd victims of the Cyclops' jaws— Now be ye quiet, children, whilst I ask What fate has thrown them on the shores of Sicily— [Enter Ulysses and his Crew.] ULYSSES. O say, my friends, where can we find a spring To slake our thirst? where can we purchase food To store our vessel?—this is very strange— Sure 't is a Bromian city—all around— Within, without the caves, there's nought but satyrs; I will address the oldest—Hail! old man. SILENUS. Hail! stranger—quickly tell me who thou art, And whence thou comest— ULYSSES. Thou behold'st Ulysses. SILENUS. I've heard of him—he is the veriest prater— ULYSSES. I'm he, I say—spare your abuse, my friend,— SILENUS. And pray whence came you last? ULYSSES. I came from Troy. SILENUS. Had you not wit enough to find your home? ULYSSES. By adverse winds I'm driven to this coast. SILENUS. Alas! your fate and mine are much alike. ULYSSES. Were you then driven to this land by storms? SILENUS. Yes, running after thieves who stole my master. ULYSSES. What place is this, and who inhabit it? SILENUS. This isle is Sicily—this mountain, Ætna. ULYSSES. Where are your cities? where your lofty walls? SILENUS. We have no cities, and no walls but rocks. ULYSSES. Who then dwell here, a race of savage beasts? SILENUS. The Cyclops dwell here, caverns are their houses. ULYSSES. Have they a ruler?—what's their mode of life? SILENUS. They're wandering shepherds, no one heeds the other. ULYSSES. Do they not till the ground? What food have they? SILENUS. They've milk and cheese;—sometimes they feast on flesh. ULYSSES. Have they not here the liquor of the grape? SILENUS. No—not a drop—O 't is a cursed country. ULYSSES. And are the Cyclops very kind to guests? SILENUS. O very kind—they prize no flesh so highly. ULYSSES. What say you?—flesh of guests!—they cannot eat them? SILENUS. Yes but they do,—they butcher all they catch. ULYSSES. Where is the Cyclops? is he in his cave? SILENUS. No, he is hunting, with his dogs, on Ætna. ULYSSES. Be brisk then, my good friend—do not detain us. SILENUS. What should I do? I'm ready to befriend you. ULYSSES. Procure us food— SILENUS. There's nothing here but flesh— ULYSSES. Well, that will do— SILENUS. And cheese, and milk of cows— ULYSSES. Bring it all forth, let's look before we buy. SILENUS. And how much gold, then, will you give for it? ULYSSES. None—none at all—I'll give a draught of wine. SILENUS. Wine? sweetest sound!—how long since I have tasted— ULYSSES. Maron himself bestow'd the precious gift. SILENUS. Maron?—how oft I've nurs'd him in these arms. ULYSSES. The son of Bacchus, as you well remember. SILENUS. Is the wine with you, or on board your ship? ULYSSES. This is the skin that holds it—look, my friend— SILENUS. That?—why there's scarce enough to wet my gullet. ULYSSES. I have much more than this— SILENUS. O the dear fountain! So sweet, so grateful— ULYSSES. Will you please to taste it? SILENUS. Aye, by all means,—I'll taste before I buy. ULYSSES. See! I have brought a cup, too, with the skin— SILENUS. Come, fill it, then— ULYSSES. Here—drink— SILENUS. Ah—ah—it smells well. ULYSSES. Then taste it, praise it not by words alone. SILENUS. I do—most excellent—it makes me merry; I long to dance—ha—ha ULYSSES. It goes down sweetly— SILENUS. O I can feel it at my finger ends. ULYSSES. I'll give you money too— SILENUS. Plague on the money! Give me but wine enough, I ask no more— ULYSSES. Now then, good satyr, bring the cheese, the lambs— SILENUS. I'll do it—what care I for master now? For one full cup of that delicious liquor I'd barter all the food of all the Cyclops, And then leap headlong from the jutting rock Into the sea—I mean, if I were drunk I'd do all this—O, he who drinks unmov'd Is surely mad. This cup's the cure of sorrow—how I'd drain it!— Plague on the Cyclops!—Hark, my friend, a word with ye. ULYSSES. Speak to me freely, as becomes a friend. SILENUS. Did you take Troy? ULYSSES. We did. SILENUS. And Helen too? ULYSSES. And Helen—and destroyed the house of Priam. SILENUS. And, when you had her safe, did all your soldiers Kiss her? she always lik'd to change her husbands; Lur'd by a splendid dress and golden chains, The traitress left that worthy man her lord; O, would the race of women were extinct! Except a few—just for my private use. Here, great Ulysses, here is flesh, and milk, And cheese in plenty—take it and be gone, But leave that goodly skin instead of it. ULYSSES. See, see—the Cyclops—'t is all over with us— What shall we do? where fly? SILENUS. Enter this cave, And hide yourself. ULYSSES. What? rush into his nets? SILENUS. Never heed that, he cannot find you there. ULYSSES. No, it shall ne'er be said that I who stood Oppos'd to thousands of the Phrygian spears, Could fear to face one man—it shall not be; If we must perish, let us perish bravely, Or, if we live, our fame shall flourish with us— SILENUS. Pr'ythee don't loiter. END OF ACT THE FIRST. [Act 2] CYCLOPS, ULYSSES, SILENUS, AND CHORUS. CYCLOPS. What means this uproar? this is not the hall O' the revelling god—here are no drums, no cymbals— Are my lambs safe within? do they suck well, And frisk around the ewes? where is my cheese? Have ye made plenty of it?—out, ye oafs! Why don't ye speak?—this staff will cure your dumbness, Look up—ye stand like dolts. SILENUS. 'An please you, master, I do look up—I see the heavens, the stars, I think I see Orion— CYCLOPS. Where's my supper? SILENUS. 'T is ready—blessings on your appetite! CYCLOPS. Are all my goblets fill'd with fresh-drawn milk? SILENUS. All full—O you may drink a sea of it. CYCLOPS. What milk? sheep's?—cow's? SILENUS. O every kind of milk, Drink what you please, but don't gulp me down with it. CYCLOPS. No, no, you're safe enough—my maw would split With such a capering fool in it as you are. Rascal, what croud is that about my cave? A gang of robbers?—see, they steal my cheese, They're loaded with my lambs—what ails you?—speak, Your eyes are swell'd—your head— SILENUS. Alas! good master, I'm beaten to a jelly—woe is me! CYCLOPS. Who beat you, satyr? SILENUS. Those same rogues and thieves there— I fought to the last—I could not save your lambs. CYCLOPS. Did not the scoundrels know I was a god, Descended from the gods too? SILENUS. So I told them— But still they stole your goods, and ate your cheese— As to yourself, they said they'd tie you fast To a long stake, and thro' that eye of yours They'd spin your bowels—and besides all this, They swore they'd flog you, bind you neck and heels Together, lodge you in the hold o'the ship, And sell you for a mason's labourer. CYCLOPS. Indeed! be brisk then—sharpen well my knives; Light a huge fire—I'll cut the throats o'the dogs— I'll eat 'em hot and hot—some I will stew— I'm tir'd of mountain food—of stags and lions— 'T is long since I have tasted human flesh. SILENUS. It makes a pretty change—most wond'rous pleasant, And very rarely do we catch a stranger. ULYSSES. O Cyclops! listen to thy guests awhile— We wander'd from our ships to purchase food; We chanc'd to find thy caves; the satyr, here, Willingly sold us for a draught of wine These lambs and cheese—we seiz'd on nought by force; Now he denies all this—falsely denies it, Merely because thou caught'st him at his tricks. SILENUS. I?—may'st thou perish— ULYSSES. If I speak not truly. SILENUS. I swear by Neptune, father of the Cyclops; I swear by Triton, by Calypso fair, By all the Nereides, by the sacred seas, By every fish that swims—I swear, O Cyclops, O my dear little master, yes, I swear, I never sold him aught—if my oath's false, May these, my dearest children, sadly perish! CHORUS. Stop—stop—in justice to our guests I speak— The strangers bought the goods—if this be false, May my dear father perish! CYCLOPS. Peace—ye lie— I'd rather trust this man than Rhadamanthus— But I would ask you, stranger, whence you came— Where were you born? ULYSSES. We're Ithacans by birth; From Troy we came, which now is lain in ashes; Tempestuous winds have driven us on thy shores. CYCLOPS. So—ye are the men who took a trip to Troy, To seize that runaway, that traitress, Helen. ULYSSES. We are, and much we've suffer'd in our battles. CYCLOPS. A precious set!—'t was well worth while to fight Those bloody battles for a foolish woman. ULYSSES. Such was the will of fate—then blame not us— But now, O son of the illustrious sea-god, Humbly we ask thee, for we must speak plainly, Not to destroy us—spare, O spare thy guests, Nor glut thy stomach with an impious feast; Reflect, O Cyclops, on the many honours Thy father shares in Greece, think of his temples, His sacred arbours, caves, and promontories; Consider too the glory gain'd to Greece By punishing the Trojans; of this glory Thou hast thy share, tho' dwelling thus retir'd Beneath the fire-distilling mount—O hear us! Let soft humanity yet touch thy heart! Scorn not th' entreaties of a suppliant stranger, Bring forth the gifts of friendship—mighty gods! To pierce with pointed spits our quivering limbs! Alas! the plains of Troy have swallowed up Far, far too many—Greece is desolate— The widows weep their husbands; gray-hair'd parents Lament their sons—wilt thou consume, O Cyclops, The poor remains?—where shall we turn for pity? Have mercy on us! think not of a banquet So foul, so impious—O respect the gods— Reflect how often wicked deeds have prov'd The bane of those who wrought them. SILENUS. Hark ye, master, I'll give you my advice—by all means eat That prosing fellow, and be sure to swallow His tongue—what a dear, pretty, prattling Cyclops You 'll then become. CYCLOPS. Gain is the wise man's god, All else is empty shew and idle boasting. Dost think me fool enough to care what honours Greece pays my father?—What's all that to me? I tell thee, man, I do not even dread The thunderbolts of Jove—for ought I know I am as great a god as Jove himself— I care not for him—let his thunders roar, Let him dash down his floods—I'm safe enough— Snug in my cave I eat, and drink, and snore; And when the Thracian Boreas shoots his snows, I clothe me in thick skins, I light a fire, And laugh at frost and snow—the earth beneath me, Whether she will or no, must throw out herbage To feed my flocks, and those I offer only To one most mighty god, this paunch of mine. To eat, to drink, to care for nought beside, This is the wise man's plan—plague on the rogues Who gave you laws, who fix'd your rules of life; I know no laws but these, to please myself, To fill my belly, and to eat you all. As to the presents that you prate about, They sha'nt be wanting—I will share among you Fire, and the cauldron of my stout fore-fathers; 'T is big enough for all of you—go in— Go in, I say—and learn my mode of feasting— ULYSSES. Alas! alas! escap'd from Trojan spears, From swelling surges, what a fate awaits us! The monster's heart is harder than his rocks. O Pallas! goddess, sprung from Jove himself, Now, now defend us! dangers tenfold blacker Than those we fac'd at Troy surround us here— O thou, who sitt'st above the glittering stars, Look down upon us, save us, Jove, O save us! SEMI-CHORUS. Open, O Polypheme, thy mighty jaws; Behold prepar'd The roast, the boil'd— I see thy grinders tear The hateful food, fresh seeth'd Within the hairy skin. SEMI-CHORUS. O could I quit, for ever quit These gloomy caves, These impious feasts! Ah cruel, bloody wretch! Who hear'st, but hear'st unmov'd, E'en at the sacred hearth, The suppliant's prayer. END OF ACT THE SECOND. [Act 3] ULYSSES, CHORUS. ULYSSES. O mighty Jove! within th' accursed cell I've seen a sight which man can scarcely credit; It is not human— CHORUS. Has the hated Cyclops Devour'd your friends?— ULYSSES. Two have already suffer'd, and the rest, Trembling like birds, now sculk within his cave. I dar'd to approach the monster—waited on him, And when I found his hunger was appeas'd, A thought came 'cross me—strait I fill'd a cup With potent wine, and gave it him to drink; Take this, I said, this is the luscious juice That Greece produces, and that Bacchus doats on; The Cyclops, gorg'd with flesh, receiv'd the cup And drain'd it at one draught—dear guest, cries he, Thou giv'st me liquor worthy of my banquet! While he still smack'd his lips, I carried to him A second dose, for well I knew the wine Would do its duty—strait he 'gan to sing— Cup after cup he drain'd—I plied him well— He's hot enough—and now, amidst my friends, He makes the cavern echo to his shouts And uncouth songs—I silently stole off— Fain would I save myself, and you too, satyrs; Say, will you quit the wretch, and sport again I'the courts of Bacchus and the Danaides? Your father there within approves my counsel, But he is weak and tottering, and he clings Close to the cup, as if he stuck by bird-lime— Ye are both young and active—join me then, And seek your former master, Bromius. CHORUS. Ah! my good man, would I might see the day When I shall fairly 'scape the monster's clutches! Here is no music—all is dead and joyless— But we have no resource. ULYSSES. You have, my friend, Hear but my plan—severely will I punish This hated beast, and give you liberty. CHORUS. Say how? with keener joy I'd hear his groans Than the soft tinkling of the harp of Asias. ULYSSES. The Cyclops, hot with wine, will long to join His brethren at their feasts— CHORUS. I understand you, And we must watch his steps—catch him alone, And strangle him, or hurl him from the rocks. ULYSSES. I mean not that—our work is not so plain. CHORUS. How then? long, long ago we've heard, Ulysses, The rumour of your cunning. ULYSSES. Thus, then, satyrs; I will persuade him not to quit his home; I'll tell him he'd be mad to share his wine With any other Cyclops—here I'll fix him— And when the potent god has laid him low, I'll sharpen some huge stake, and fire its point, And as the shipwright bores with whirling auger, So will we bore, with the still-flaming shaft, The eye of Polypheme. CHORUS. 'T is well—'t is well. ULYSSES. When we've thus blinded him, yourself, your father, And all our friends shall haste aboard my ship, And row away most merrily. CHORUS. O glorious! But say, Ulysses, will you need our aid To twirl the stake? ULYSSES. Yes truly—'t will be weighty. CHORUS. O! I would work like fifty carts and horses, Could I but blind the dog, and root out thoroughly That wasp's-nest eye of his— ULYSSES. Be silent now— When I command, be ready—tho' I've quitted My friends within, and might escape alone, Yet I should scorn to do it; we will live Or die together. SEMI-CHORUS. Who first, who last shall seize The burning brand, And plunge its fiery point, Within the radiant orb? SEMI-CHORUS. Hark, hark, I hear within The sound of song; The swelling notes are harsh, The minstrel rude— Lo! from the rocky cave, Th' unwieldy Cyclops reels; O haste, and join his strains. SEMI-CHORUS. Happy, happy, happy he Who quaffs the luscious juice, Happy in the purple flood That sparkling flows around! How sweet, on downy turf reclin'd, To laugh the summer hours away With her we love! How sweet, by Bacchus fir'd, to trace The winning graces of her form, To mark the down-cast, beamy eye, And catch the fragrance of her breath! END OF ACT THE THIRD. [Act 4] CYCLOPS, ULYSSES, SILENUS, CHORUS. CYCLOPS. Whither, whither shall I wander, Joyous from my rich repast? As a deeply laden vessel, Well I'm stor'd with food and wine. The glowing verdure of the field, The cooling breezes of the spring, Entice me to forsake The gloomy, still retreat, To join the Cyclops' feasts. CHORUS. See, he comes; his shining orb, Like a flaming pine-tree, burns; Roseate tints have flush'd his skin, Brighter than the hue of nymphs Sporting in their dewy caves; Haste, and shade his manly brow With wreaths of flowers. ULYSSES. Hear me, O Cyclops, and I'll tell to you Th' adventures of the god you love so well. CYLOPS. And do'st thou call this liquor, then, a god? ULYSSES. No doubt—the sweetest comforter of mortals. CYCLOPS. Truly he warms my stomach pleasantly. ULYSSES. O! he's the best of gods, he never harms us. CYCLOPS. And is he pleas'd with dwelling in a skin? ULYSSES. Aye, put him where you will, he's always easy. CYCLOPS. Surely he might have had some better clothing? ULYSSES. Who heeds his covering if the god be good? CYCLOPS. True, 't is no matter. ULYSSES. Do not leave us, Cyclops— Stay where you are, and drink, and drink again. CYCLOPS. Shall I not give some liquor to my brethren? ULYSSES. No—you'll be mightier if you keep it all. CYCLOPS. I shall be civiller if I let them taste it. ULYSSES. Such drinking-bouts too often end in blood. CYCLOPS. O! were I doubly drunk none dares to touch me. ULYSSES. Still I advise you not to quit your cave. CYCLOPS. Poh! he's a fool who loves to drink alone. ULYSSES. A wise man, if he's drunk, will stay at home. CYCLOPS. What shall I do, Silenus? SILENUS. Never budge; I see no wit in seeking other mouths. CYCLOPS. Well, here the grass looks fresh— SILENUS. 'T is mighty pleasant To booze i'the sunshine—please to sit, good master. CYCLOPS. Why do you place the cup behind me, rascal? SILENUS. Lest any one should touch it. CYCLOPS. Out!—I say— You drink my liquor, rogue, behind my back; Here, place the cup in sight—approach me, guest, Tell me thy name—thy name? ULYSSES. My name is No-one.— But say, O Cyclops, what return you'll make me For all the kind attention I have shewn you. CYCLOPS. I'll eat thee last of all. ULYSSES. That's very handsome. CYCLOPS. What are you doing, scoundrel? are you drinking? SILENUS. No—not a drop—only my eyes are dim, And I look'd close, to see the curious carving Of this most goodly cup. CYCLOPS. Take care, take care— Here—pour me out a cup-full—fill to the brim. SILENUS. And how much water shall I mix with it? CYCLOPS. None—none—come, bring it— SILENUS. Stop, I'll fetch a wreath And place it on your head—besides 't is proper That I, as cup-bearer, should taste the liquor. CYCLOPS. Plague on this trifling! SILENUS. Trifling? not at all, The liquor's much too good to trifle with— Come wipe your mouth—and then I give the cup— CYCLOPS. There, there, you fool, my lips and beard are clean. SILENUS. Now you should drink it in a proper posture, Reclining gracefully—here—see me do it— Thus—thus— [Drinks. CYCLOPS. Hold, hold, you rascal. SILENUS. Dearest heart! I've drunk it out before I was aware. CYCLOPS. Out, oaf!—come, guest, be thou my cup-bearer. ULYSSES. With all my heart—I'm us'd to such employment. CYCLOPS. Now fill the goblet. ULYSSES. Yes, I do—be quiet. CYCLOPS. 'T is not so easy to be drunk and quiet. ULYSSES. Here, take the goblet—drain it at a draught— Would he might swallow it! CYCLOPS. 'T is well—'t is well— O! what a charming wood the vine-tree's made of! ULYSSES. After your meal you cannot drink too much— Drench yourself well—then sink to sweetest slumber, Leave not a drop— CYCLOPS. How's this? my brains are swimming, The sky and earth whirl round me—now I spy The throne of Jove—I see the gods assembled— What tho' the graces court me—I'll not kiss 'em. Hence, hence, and let me sleep. SILENUS. Aye, go thy ways. [Ulysses conducts the Cyclops into his cave and returns. ULYSSES. Now, ye brave sons of Bacchus, all is ready; The monster sleeps, the pointed stake is flaming, Now let's to work—be men, my friends, be men. CHORUS. O! we have hearts of adamant—return— We'll quickly follow. ULYSSES. Vulcan, lord of Ætna, Now do thy duty—sleep, thou son of night, Rest heavy on the wretch—What? shall a band So bold, so fam'd as ours, inglorious perish, And basely crouch before the impious Cyclops? CHORUS. See, they grasp the monster's neck; See, they point the fiery dart, And plunge it deep— Bacchus, Bacchus, fight for us! Soon again my longing eyes Shall view thy beauteous front, With ivy crown'd. END OF ACT THE FOURTH. [Act 5] ULYSSES, CHORUS, CYCLOPS. (The latter in his cave.) ULYSSES. Peace, peace,—by all the gods, I pray you, silence; Breathe not a word, nor cough, nor wink your eye, Lest ye may rouze the Cyclops from his slumber. CHORUS. There—there—we hold our breath— ULYSSES. Come in, I say, And help to do the deed. CHORUS. We cannot stir. ULYSSES. Are ye all lame? CHORUS. I rather think we are; Our legs shake under us— ULYSSES. Ye seem convuls'd. CHORUS. 'T is very strange—I'm sure we cannot help you, But we can sing an Orphic ode— ULYSSES. O cowards! Well—be it so—I and my brave companions Will do without you; sing some cheering ditty. CHORUS. How base is fear—the truly brave Snatch the deathless wreath of fame; Shouting crouds their steps attend. Warriors, raise the sinewy arm; Deeper, deeper plunge your fires; Warriors, work the deed of wrath, Laugh to scorn the monster's groans, And stain, with impious blood, The massy shaft. CYCLOPS, from within. Alas! alas! I'm blinded, scorch'd, and pierc'd. CHORUS. O! sing that strain again! CYCLOPS. Alas! alas! I perish, I am blinded—do not think The dogs will 'scape me yet—here, by this entrance, I'll stand, and close it with my arms. Alas! CHORUS. Cyclops, what means this clamour? hast thou reel'd Into the fire? CYCLOPS. No-one, I say, has pierc'd me. CHORUS. Then No-one is to blame. CYCLOPS. No-one has blinded me. CHORUS. Then thou canst see. CYCLOPS. Would thou could'st see no better! CHORUS. And how did No-one blind thee? CYCLOPS. Out, thou scoffer! Where is that No-one? CHORUS. He is no where, Cyclops. CYCLOPS. That cursed guest, I tell thee, has destroyed me; He gave me drink that burnt my flesh—where is he? Where are my other guests? have they escaped? Or are they in my cave? CHORUS. They're in thy cave. CYCLOPS. Where—where? CHORUS. They're close beneath the rock, thou hast them. CYCLOPS. Alas! I've split my skull against this ridge. CHORUS. And now thou'lt lose them. CYCLOPS. Tell me where they are— CHORUS. There—there— CYCLOPS. I cannot catch them. CHORUS. There again, More to the left. CYCLOPS. Alas! alas! thou mock'st me. CHORUS. Now I'll speak truly, Cyclops; they're before thee. ULYSSES. Yes, monster, far enough from thee; and know, Ulysses leads them hence. CYCLOPS. What? hast thou chang'd Thy name then, and procur'd a new one? ULYSSES. No—I keep that my father gave to me— I tell thee that I glory in thy sufferings; I should have blush'd, when Troy was spoken of, Had I not punish'd thy detested crime. And now I quit thee—soon my ship shall bear me To my much long'd-for country. CYCLOPS. Never, never, I'll follow to the sea—tear up a rock, And hurl it on thy vessel— CHORUS. We shall join Ulysses' crew, and seek our jovial god. CHORUS. Bear me, O! Bacchus, to thy sunny hills, Where twisted tendrils bend Beneath the clustering grape! With ready hand I'll press The purple spoil, And drain the fragrant stream. Hail, Bromius, ivy-crowned king, Leader of the revelling bands, Thyrsus-bearing Bromius, hail! What is man without thy gifts? Dull and formal, stern and cold— Thy liquid treasures warm the heart, Thy piercing juices fire the brain, And all around is love and joy. Laughing Venus quaffs thy cup, Quicker pants her heaving breast, Redder roses tinge her cheek, Lighter graces swim around her. Hail! Bromius, hail! O bear me swift Where clanging cymbals echo shrill, Mix'd with the Bacchanalian shout! See the sportive nymphs advance! Their light robes floating in the breeze; Scattering a thousand sweetest scents, They jocund wave their shining locks, And twine the wanton dance. THE END. Specimen of Guy of Warwick. AN EPIC POEM, IN TWENTY-FOUR CANTOS. Or els so bolde in chivalrie As was syr Gawayne or syr Gie. Squyr of lowe degree. CANTO I. I In those rare days, when Æthelstan did reign, And Scots and Danes sore trembled at his frown, Those untir'd foes, who cut, and came again— In those rare days was born in Warwick town, To dame of low degree, a rosy boy; Fat were his limbs, but firm—they call'd him Guy; An imp of promise 't was, his mother's joy; For often would he smile with roguish eye, Tho' oftener far he kick'd, and squall'd right lustily. II When scarce thirteen, his prowess burst to light, Foretelling future deeds of high renown; His play-mates spake his name with wild affright, For often had he crack'd each play-mate's crown. The book-learn'd monarch of the stinging birch, To check Guy's pranks, now flogg'd, and now harangu'd; Vain thoughts! the dog would almost rob a church; His wrathful master, and his play-mates bang'd, Swore Guy would be a knight, or else that Guy'd be hang'd. III And true they swore; for fierce in manhood's prime, Well dubb'd, well arm'd, he join'd with huge delight That highly-lauded band who spent their time In borrowing knocks, and paying them at sight; Of errant knights Sir Guy became the pride; The east, the west, his mighty feats could tell; How little did he heed his gentle hide, While many a giant grim he sweated well, And spitted too, like geese, full many an infidel. IV Thus by Sir Guy the jolly hours were pass'd; But glee unmix'd, alas! is rarely found; E'en sticking Saracens will tire at last, And brave Sir Guy to England's shore is bound. Luckless the day when Asia's plains he left, And o'er his brawny shoulders slung his shield, And sheath'd that sword which many a pate had cleft; Luckless the day, for soon Sir Guy must yield To arms more potent far than those that Paynims wield. V Nor buckler stout, nor hauberk's linked mail, Could save the warrior from his lethal wound; Idly his forehead did the helmet vail, For Phelis' eyes still made his brain turn round: Phelis was fair as glistening snow, I ween, Winning her look, and jaunty was her air, Her person not too fat—nor yet too lean; Some folk the maid to Helen would compare, But Helen, simple fools, a blackmoor was to her. VI How wan! how woe-be-gone is good Sir Guy! He thinks, prates, dreams, of nought but Phelis bright, On damoselles he'd ever kept an eye, But damoselle like this ne'er cross'd his sight: Warwick's high castle did his jewel hold; Thither the pensive lover bent his way; And now he quak'd with fear; and now, more bold, He humm'd delighted many an amorous lay, And vow'd to drown himself, or bear the maid away. VII The castle's Lord, the Earl of Warwick he, Receiv'd right courteously his valiant guest; Strong was the ale, and shrill the minstrelsy, And Guy drank deep, and then retir'd to rest. But rest, alas! no leman true doth cheer; Though loudly-snoring, still before his sight Floats the sweet image of his lady dear, Her dulcet voice still charms in dreams of night, Her sparkling eyes inflame, her ruddy lips invite. VIII Such were Guy's dreams, which fled at opening morn; When up he rose and to the garden hied; There, far more fragrant than the flowering thorn, In bower of eglantine he Phelis spy'd; His breast throbb'd high with hope; a sudden spring Brought him to Phelis' feet; “Ah! mistress dear,” He faltering said, “Ah! take the heart I bring— “To my loud love-notes kindly lend an ear, “Nor drive me, lady sweet, to halters and despair. IX “Sure never was a shape so deft as thine, “Nor eyes so black, nor cheeks so dainty red; “Never was heaven-born goddess so divine, “And die I must, or share my Phelis' bed; “Quick let the holy spousals chaunted be, “I pine, I languish for my blooming bride; “What's sticking Turks to marrying girls like thee? “What's chivalry, with all its pomp and pride, “Compar'd to sitting snug, my dear one, by thy side?” X “Hold, hold, Sir Knight,” the scornful Phelis cries, “I vastly marvel at the tale you're telling; “At length, forsooth, I've chanced with a prize, “A leman gay without a house to dwell in: “Small are your wits, that could not straight perceive “You're little fitting to my high degree; “The Earl of Warwick, you may well believe, “Would hang ten times ere give a maid like me “To one who's scant of coin to pay the wedding-fee.” XI Full stounding were her words; for well Guy knew Nor house, nor coin, nor chattels he possess'd; Heartless awhile he stood, and look'd askew; But of a bargain bad he made the best; “Fair maid,” quoth he, “if want of gold be all “The harm thou spy'st in me, I'm not offended; “I'll win me gold in fight, or fearless fall; “So my sad hap may be at length amended, “And I may gain the bliss to which my heart pretended.” XII Guy hurried home, and on the common caught His horse, which he had wisely turn'd to grass; From an old trunk his casque and shield he brought, And rusty greaves, and breastplate wrought with brass, And all his stock of errant furniture; He clean'd, and fix'd them on his body soon; Then seiz'd his lance, and took his seat secure; Off started Guy, as bright as silver spoon, And wond'rous fierce he look'd, more fierce than man i'the moon. XIII Ah! who can tell how hard it is to trot O'er stony ways, and staggering steed to goad! How very hard to travel, sweltering hot, Without a single ale-house on the road! Yet if all-stirring love shall drive us on, Or still more potent want of coin shall press, Who'd meanly heed a dislocated bone, Or parching thirst, or hunger's sharp distress, Or day in mire yspent, or bed in wilderness?— Jack the Giant-killer. A FRAGMENT. ?? ??????? ???? Homeri Ilias. To whom the giant-killing Jack replied; “Guest, thou hast spoken right; but ere I enter Thy ship of heart-of-oak, well-built, swift-sailing, First let us sup, for so my heart inclines me; Then let us go to bed; and when the morn, With rosy fingers, opes the gates of heaven, We'll spread our sails, and cross the barren ocean.” He said; and lo! a blue-arm'd, red-fac'd maid, With apron white, brings in a fresh-wash'd cloth Of hempen thread well twisted, wove long since By a skilful weaver; this she swift unfolds, And on the table, form'd of close-knit oak, She jerking spreads; then seeks the knives and forks And clattering plates, and from the cool brick'd pantry She bears cold pork, which Jack had left at dinner, And places it before them; quick she brings, Well fill'd with dark-brown beer, a wooden can Of curious workmanship, the which to Jack His friend Tom Thumb had given, and the which Was given to Thumb by Hickatrift divine, And Hickatrift had stolen it from the castle Of mighty Ogre, whom he boldly slew In dreadful fight, thwacking with knotty staff. Supper serv'd up, Jack smiling thus began; “Cheer up, my friend, although thou'rt griev'd in mind Because thy daughter in the giant's cave Lies bound in ropen bonds; I'll set her free; But now attend, and treasure in thy mind What I shall say; when heart-corroding cares, And bitter groans, assail thy labouring breast, Then eat and drink, for I do nothing know That sooner drives those heart-corroding cares And bitter groans away, than joyous feasting.” To whom the white-hair'd traveller replied; “O giant-killing Jack, thou speak'st most shrewdly: Although with keenest grief my mind is stor'd, Yet will I joy awhile in thy repast.”— He said—and Jack did separate with ease Two ribs of white-tooth'd hog, and to his guest Gave them; the old man eats, and from the can Draws frequent draughts, and soon his soul is gladden'd. When their dear hearts were satisfied with food, The giant-killing Jack again bespake him: “O guest, before we sleep, I'll give to thee A keep-sake, and do thou return the like. Take this tobacco-pouch; 't is made of skin Of mountain-deer, that on the windy top Of Cheviot play'd; 't was given long ago, By a Scotch smuggler, to my grandfather; He left it to his son, and I have now Succeeded to it, for my father's dead.” To whom the white-hair'd traveller replied, “I take thy gift, O host, and give instead This clasped knife, the blade whereof is steel Of finest temper, and the haft of horn.” He said, and rising from their wicker seats, They haste to bed, and sweet sleep falls upon them; But when the rosy-finger'd morn was risen, Jack leaps from bed, and first puts on his breeches; Then o'er his legs he draws his worsted stockings, Well darned by his skilful grandmother; Then buckles on his shoes, and buttons tight His calf-skin waistcoat; over all he throws His coat, and cross his brawny shoulders flings His steely hanger stain'd with giant blood. Below he meets the traveller, and in haste They drink a mess of milk, drawn from the cows That, ever-chewing, range the fruitful meads; Walking they seek the ship of heart-of-oak, When close beneath a hedge of flowering thorn, They spy an aged dame, who slowly stoop'd To gather sticks; she was a cunning witch, Of high renown in all the country round; Much had she told of true; and if of false Aught had escap'd her, no one dar'd to say so. The giant-killing Jack address'd her smiling, “Hail mother! tell me, for full well thou know'st, If the adventure that I've now begun Shall prosperous prove—speak, and I'll give thee sixpence.” “Sixpence! who can resist thee?”—stop! ah stop! My mother dear, cries Jack—thou'st said enough— I seize those charmed words as happiest bodings. The money paid, they quickly climb the ship; Tugging they hoist the sails; and favouring winds Bear them across the streams of misty ocean. The ship runs hissing thro' the frothy waves; At length they reach the island, where the giant Dwells in his well-built castle; soon they spy it, And gaze with admiration on the walls Of high-pil'd stones, and on the yawning ditch. Strait to the gate they go, and knock aloud— The Ogre o'er the buttress rears his head— They tremble-when the mighty giant calls, With brazen lungs, as if a hundred bulls Bellow'd at once, “Whence are you? why this uproar? Say, are you trading mariners, who sail On business thro' the seas, or at the risque Of your own lives, seize ye on others' goods?” To whom, with words deceitful, Jack replied: “We're trading mariners, our well-built ship Is stranded on your coast, and of the crew We only have escap'd.”—The Ogre thus; “Enter my castle.”—Slow the heavy gates Turn'd creaking on their hinges—in they pass; But when the giant stood before their eyes, Monstrous to see, Jack, in an under voice, Thus spake—“O venerable, white-hair'd guest, Never can I by force of arms destroy This mountain of a man; but by my tricks And wise deceit, I'll strive to do his business, And leave his corse a prey to dogs and crows.” This said, the giant calls them to his meal; High on the table stood a wooden bowl, Well fill'd with hasty pudding—this espied, Jack, in his mind discreet, quick form'd a plan To kill the giant, and to free the maid. While, on the pudding quite intent, the Ogre, Cramm'd his huge belly, Jack, between his shirt And dark-brown skin, slipp'd down a leathern bag Of many folds, then join'd in the repast; He not into his stomach threw the food, But with a dext'rous hand he fill'd the bag, Prepar'd with cunning mind—at length he cries, “O host, thy glory shoots above the stars, Vast are thy jaw-bones, and thou eat'st with ease More than would satisfy a hundred men Of modern days; but see me do a deed Thy mighty soul dares not.” “What's that?” cried he. “Thus from my stomach do I loose the food That's therein pil'd.” He said, and with his knife Open'd the bag, and forth the pudding flow'd; The giant saw it; and with foolish mind, Struck a bold blow, and fairly pierc'd his paunch. As mountain streams descending join in one, And dash impetuous in a white cascade, While shepherds gazing shudder at the sight, So gush'd the pudding from the monster's maw; He falls—the vaulted castle rocks around— His armour clangs—he roars aloud for aid, And echo, from a thousand caverns, sends His roars again—when with his axe of steel, The wood-cutter, with frequent strokes, cuts down The lofty pine, it tumbles creaking, crashing; So fell the giant—as the mountain lion, Stung by sharp hunger, leaps into the fold, Where by the shepherd's spear transfix'd he lies, Lashing his sides, and darting fiery looks, Even in death; so dreadful look'd the giant; Jack smiling cries— A FRAGMENT FROM A COMEDY OF EUBULUS. O Jove most honour'd, if I e'er speak ill Of women, may I perish!—what?—of women? Why they're the best of all thy precious gifts. Let's grant Medea bad—Penelope Was sure a none-such—then, perhaps, you'll tell me That Clytemnestra was a sorry jade; Go to!—I'll stop your prating with—Alcestis— Phædra you'll urge was wicked—well, I know it, But then 'gainst her I bring you—let me see— 'Gainst her I bring—whom?—whom?—Alas! alas! How soon my stock of virtuous dames is spent, While a long list of bad ones still remains. EPIGRAM. [Hunger, perhaps, might cure your love] (From the Greek.) Hunger, perhaps, might cure your love, Or time your passion greatly alter; If both should unsuccessful prove, I strongly recommend a halter. EPIGRAM. (In part from the Greek.) ON SOME MICE. [Hence—hence—away! I'm much mistaken] Hence—hence—away! I'm much mistaken If here you'll smell or cheese, or bacon; Mark my spare form, my pallid looks, And pry about, I've nought but books; If, my good friends, you wish to dine, You'll seek some richer house than mine, For sure you're mice of more discerning Than here to live, like me, on learning. IN POETAM QUENDAM AMATORIUM TRANSLATION BY THE AUTHOR. Why paint with glowing tints the burning kiss, The thrills of passion, all the lover's bliss? Youth needs not fancy's aid to wake desires, Warm in the vigor of his native fires; While age shall sorrowing view the rapturous scene, And deeper sigh for joys that once have been. THE CONSTANT LOVER. (In the manner of Sir J. Suckling.) 'Tis mighty strange—three weeks are past, And still I constant prove; Will this fierce flame for ever last? This miracle of love? Shall I still sigh at Chloe's feet, Nor wish my heart to free? No doubt—until I chance to meet A prettier girl than she. THE JILTED LOVER. I was weeping and pouring my moan, And making a terrible pother, For the girl, that I thought was my own, Had fled to the arms of another. Alas! I was left in the lurch, The talk of the town and its jest; While my traitress was led to the church, And my rival completely was blest. But how short the duration of bliss! And how quick is grief turned to laughter! I heard that my sweet pretty miss Chang'd again, and elop'd the day after. TO CHLOE TOO COLD. I hate those eyes that look askance Whene'er I gaze with soft desire; O! check that chill, repelling glance, Nor cast cold water on my fire; Still tho' I sue, and sigh, and languish, Eager to win one favouring smile, Unmov'd you view my piercing anguish, And seem quite weary all the while, Give me the girl whose glowing heart Speaks kindly in her beamy eyes; Blest if her looks a joy impart, She shares my transports as they rise; But should I win your cold consent, Alas! I ne'er shall win it soon, I fear at church you'd still repent, Or freeze me in the honey-moon. TO CHLOE TOO WARM. I hate those eyes that gloat on mine, And watch my every thought and motion; 'T is I must seek love's wreath to twine, Of being courted I've no notion; The fruit's too mellow for my taste That falls before the tree is shaken; Why, foolish gudgeon, why such haste? Before I bait my hook 't is taken; Give me the girl who'd well be woo'd; Give me to melt a heart of stone; Unless the game be long pursu'd, I take no pride in 't when 't is won; With doating fondness, looks so jealous, Chloe would prove a pleasant thing; Espous'd, no doubt her love so zealous, Would tie me to her apron string. THE DESPAIRING LOVER. Say, Delia, since that iron heart Forbids me more to woo, What deed, to cure the rankling smart, Should scorned lovers do? I'll do—what desperate act will move That stubborn bosom most? I'll do—ah! grant me power, O! love, To execute the boast! I'll do—then drop one willing tear, Nor cast cold looks about you— Yes—I'm resolv'd—too cruel fair, I'll do—I'll do without you. LINES ADDRESSED TO MISS D. ON RETURNING TO HER, THROUGH DR. S., A PUZZLE OF BEADS. Pray, lady fair, for what ill deeds Am I thus doom'd to tell my beads? To fix the glittering baubles right, I labour morning, noon, and night; I twist them round and round again, But all my twirlings are in vain, For, whether I unloose or bind them, Still where they should not be, I find them. Surely some dark and awful spell Within the slender knot must dwell, And witching fingers twin'd a noose, Which none but conjurors can unloose. And yet 't is hard that I, who read The works of venerable Bede, That I, who bit by ancient lore, O'er musty bead-rolls daily pore, And live in bonds of friendship true, With many a good old beadsman too; 'T is hard that I, when fairly pitted, By these small beads should be outwitted. Yet so it is—I here confess it, As to the charm I ne'er shall guess it; Finding, alas! 't is vain to try, To loosen bonds that ladies tie. No more I'll sorrowing rack my brain, But send the mischief back again, For why thus sadder grow and sadder, 'Bout three blue beads in one blue bladder. LINES ADDRESSED TO MRS. RACHEL HUNTER, ON HER LOSS OF A PAIR OF SLIPPERS. Anacreon, that galant old poet, Wish'd in an ode—I am sure you know it— Without a single thought of scandal, That he could be his mistress' sandal; And Hudibras, that queer old codger, Yet of a woman no bad dodger; When praising high his favourite beauty, Honours the shadow of her shoe-tie. Thus at all times an ardent swain, In hopes his charmer's smiles to gain, Cares not what length his passions go, And worships her from top to toe. Some steal a ribband, some a locket, Some put her scissars in their pocket, To shew they hold in highest honor, All that their mistress bears upon her. Sure then, dear Ma'am, 't is falsely said, That still you fret, and scold your maid, And search your closets round and round, Because your slippers can't be found; Think but an instant, and you'll see, 'T is a mere trick of gallantry; For what true lover would despise To pocket e'en the oddest prize? At least some beau, who sees with fear Your wanderings in the evening air, Who loves eternally to be Blest with your sprightly company: Might hide your slippers, as a hint, There's something rather pretty in 't, That tender ladies should not roam, And thus he bids you stay at home. So seems the case: at least 't is vain To hope to find your goods again— Whether in man's or woman's power, Be sure to you they come no more; For who's so proud as not to choose, To tread in Mrs. Hunter's shoes? LINES ON THORPE GROVE. Non umbra altorum nemorum, non mollia possunt Prata movere animum. Virg. Hark! 't is the closing crash! the ruffian axe Has ceas'd its toil—with its last, hated, blow, A shriek arose, and from his lov'd domain The lingering genius of the grove is fled. 'T is ruin all—no lonely pine-tree waves On yonder brow, not e'en a blasted stem Swart, sear, and riven, points the hill that rose In tufted verdure; on its deep-scarr'd side The shiver'd trunk, the withering branch is spread, In careless desolation. We might deem The fierce invader's bands had won the shore Of fair Icenia, and had mark'd their course By wrath destructive. Sweetly-soothing shades Ye shall not sink unsung, ye still shall live To memory dear, when cold the ruthless hand That bow'd you to the dust. In fancy's eye Ye oft would seem a holy fragment spar'd Of that deep wood, which, antique legends tell, Once fring'd the steep of Mosswold, and inwrapp'd, In its dark bosom, him, the sainted youth, From whose carv'd choir the chanted mass would float Now loud, now low, along the arched path, And guide the stranger pilgrim to his shrine. And oft, again, methought your western verge Had skirted Surrey's bowers, who erst would start At break of dawn, from wild and feverish dreams, Would wander, heart-struck, through your chilly dews, And mingle with the mournful woodlark's song His plaintive love-lays, only heedless heard By Geraldine, his dear and matchless theme. Th' illusion's fled—but not from me alone Is harmless pleasure wrested by your fall. The boy, from thraldom 'scaped, would hither haste With bounding step, and mount, with lightsome heart, The mossy slope, and while he careful cull'd The suckling wild, or seiz'd the linnet's nest, Or climb'd your towering stems, would thoughtless drink Freshness, and health, and spirit from your breeze. The lover too would lead from prying eyes, Along your secret glen, his mistress coy; Her blush was veiled by the circling gloom, And safe concealment chas'd the fear that clos'd Those lips, which long'd to tell the softest tale. Here the pale student, who had patient por'd O'er lore profound, would slowly stalk at close Of twilight gray, what time the thrush's note Rang shrill; and still his busy thoughts would turn To the high lessons and nice subtilties With which his brain was fraught, till Nature's charms Won him, reluctant, from his crabbed dream To pensive peace; now on his glancing eye The star of eve arises, through the trees Twinkling by starts—and deeper darkness now Creeps o'er the sky, and all the sparkling host In quick succession catch his learned gaze. But to the son of song far dearer still Your calm and dim retreat; at midnight damp, When the white moon-beam slanted thro' your breaks, He'd sit entranc'd beneath the loftiest pine, And listen to the wind, that fitful swell'd Amid its restless boughs, and then, perchance, The dying cadence of the bird of night Steals on his ear, till the rich flow of song, In linked melody, is loudly pour'd. Or harsher was the hour; the thicken'd clouds Roll'd the loud thunder—Sudden burst the glare Of lightnings livid, wavy—quick succeeds A blacker night—and now the grove assumes A sacred horror, such as erst appall'd The druid in his woods, who shuddering bent Before his Gods, and fear'd his potent prayer Might force, embodied, on his quivering sight, The awful, frowning Spirit of the shade. Such the pure pleasures which thou once hast given; And e'en the hasty traveller shall mourn Your fallen pride, and miss the spot, where, pleas'd, His eye had rested; mid the wide-spread scene, Where Wensome glides along his sedgy meads, Bounded by sloping hills, with wood embrown'd, Yon bleak, bare ridge shall mock the scornful arm That robb'd it of its honours—yes, fair grove, For thee the sigh shall rise, while feeling glows, While taste inspires, and rural beauty charms. Nov. 1808. EPITAPH [Here rest the bones of Ho and Hi] On two Chinese Astronomers, Hi and Ho, who were put to death by order of their Emperor, for getting drunk, instead of observing an Eclipse, which they were appointed to watch—the eclipse however proved to be an invisible one. See the Story in Hale's Chronology, vol. I. Here rest the bones of Ho and Hi, Whose fate was sad yet risible, Being hang'd because they did not spy Th' eclipse that was invisible. Heigh ho! 't is said a love of drink Occasion'd all their trouble, But this is hardly true, I think, For drunken folks see double. ON THE MANAGERS OF THE GATE-HOUSE CONCERT IN NORWICH, TAKING MONEY FOR ADMISSION TO IT, WITH THE VIEW OF RAISING A FUND FOR BUILDING A CONCERT-ROOM. Amphion, as old stories tell, Wall'd a huge city tight and well, By gently strumming on his shell, With now and then a crash; Cannot your louder tweedle-dum Raise from its base a single room? Must you, ere bricks and mortar come, Exchange your notes for cash? LINES TO MISS S. ? At the Illumination in Norwich, on 16th June, 1814. Louisa haste, above, beneath, The festive garland twine; Not Flora's hand could bend the wreath, More skilfully than thine. And when at close of lingering day, Their blaze the tapers pour; O! seat thee midst those garlands gay, Thyself the fairest flower. LINES ADDRESSED TO HUDSON GURNEY, Esq. ON HIS GIVING ME A LEARNED LITTLE WORK, WRITTEN BY HIMSELF, BOUND IN RED LEATHER. Accept my best thanks for the little red book, With delight and amaze on the pages I look; And, if I can prevent it, it ne'er shall be said, That the little red book was a book little read.
