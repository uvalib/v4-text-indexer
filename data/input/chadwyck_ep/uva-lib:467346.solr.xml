      <field name="fulltext">POEMS 1889â1893 OCEANUS I While still the dusk impends above the glimmering waste A tremor comes: wave after wave turns silvery bright: A sudden yellow gleam athwart the east traced: The waning stars fade forth, swift perishing pyres. The moon lies pearly-wan upon the front of Night. Then all at once upwells a flood of golden light And a myriad waves flash forth a myriad fires: Now is the hour the amplest glory of life to taste, Outswimming towards the sun upon the billowy waste. II The pure green waves! with crests of dazzling foam ashine, Onward they roll: innumerably grand, they beat A wild and jubilant triumph-music all divine! The sea-fowl, their white kindred of the spray-swept air, Scream joyous echoes as with wave-dipped pinions fleet They whirl before the blast or vanish 'mid blown sleet. In loud-resounding, strenuous, conquering play they fare, Like clouds, high over head, forgotten lands i' the brineâ Great combing deep-sea waves with sunlit foam ashine. III On the wide wastes she lives her lawless, passionate life: Enslaved of none, the imperious mighty Sea! How glorious the music of her waves at strife With all the winds of heaven that, fiercely wooing, blow! On high she ever chants her psalm of Victory; Afar her turbulent pÃ¦an tells that she is free: The tireless albatross with wings like foam or snow Flies leagues on leagues for days, and yet the world seems rife With nought save windy waves and the Sea's wild free life! IV How oft the strange, wild, haunting glamour of the Sea, The strange, compelling magic of her thrilling Voice, Have won me, when, 'mid lonely places, wild and free As any wand'ring wind, I have heard along the shore The wondrous ever-varying Sea-song loud rejoice. I have seen a snowy petrel, arising, poise Above the green-sloped wave, then pass for evermore From keenest sight, and I have thought that I might be Thus also deathward lured by glamour of the Sea. V Hark to the long resilient surge o' the ebbing tide: With shingly rush and roar it foams adown the strand: The great Sea heaves her restless bosom far and wideâ Heedless she seems of winds and all the forceful laws That bar her empire over the usurping Land: Enough, she dreams, is her imperial command To make the very torrents, waveward falling, pause: She scorns the Bridegroom-Land, yet is a subject Bride For she must come and go with each recurrent tide. VI On moonless nights, when winds are still, her stealthy waves Creep towards the listening land; with voices soft and low They whisper strange sea-secrets 'mid the hollow caves: A wondrous song it is that rises then and falls! Deep-buried memories of the ancient long-ago, Confused strange echoes of some vanished old-world woe, Weird prophecies reverberant round those wave-worn walls: When loud the wrathful billows roar and the Sea runes Her deepest mourning broods beneath the foaming waves. VIII As some aerial spirit weaves a rainbow-veil Of mist, his high immortal loveliness to hide; So too thy palpitant waters, duskily pale, Ofttimes take on a sudden splendour wild. Then thy sea-horses rise, fierce prancing side by side, Andâlike the host of the dead-arisenâride Ghastly afar to bournes where all the dead lie piled! ... Superb, fantastic, crown'd with flying splendours frail, Thou, when in dreams, thou weav'st thy phosphorescent veil! VIII Vast, vast, immeasurably vast, thy dreadful peace When heaving with slow, mighty breath thou liest In utter rest, and dost thy ministering winds release So that with folded wings they too subside, Floating through hollow spaces, though the highest Stirs his long tremulous pinions when thou sighest! Then in thy soul, that doth in fathomless depths abide, All wild desires and turbulent longings ceaseâ Profound, immeasurable then, thy dreadful peace! IX But in thy noon of night, serene as death, when under The terrible silence of that archÃ¨d dome Not a lost whisper ev'n of thy wandering thunder Ascends like the spiral smoke of perishing flame, Nor dying wave on thy swart bosom sinks in foamâ Then, then the world is thine, thy heritage, thy home! What then for thee, O Sea, thou Terror! or what name To call thee by, thou Sphinx, thou Mystery, thou Wonderâ Above thou art Living Death, Oblivion under! A PARIS NOCTURNE Over the lonesome hollows And secret haunts of the river, Past field and homestead and village, Past the grey wharves and the piers The darkness moves like a veil, Save when obscure, vast, nigrescent Flakes from the travelling gloom Slant westward great fans of blackness. Then a mist of radiance, Lamps with red lights and yellow, Foam-white, and blue as an ice floe, Lamps intermingling with gas-light, Leagues of wind-wavered gas-light, Lamps of the masts of barges, Lamps upon sloops and on steamers, Lamps below quays and dark bridges, Yellow and red and green, Like a myriad growths phosphorescent When a swamp, erewhile flooded with waters, Lies low to the stare of the moon And the stealthy white breath of the wind. And, over all, one light Palpitant, circular, wide, Sweeping the city vastâ Yonder, beyond where in shadow The thronged Champs ElysÃ©es are filling With echoes of human voices, With shadows of human lives, With phantoms of vampyre-vicesâ Beyond where the serpentine river Curves in a coil gigantic, And straight, a thin shaft, through the vagueness Soars the high lighthouse of Paris, Soars o'er the sea of the city With all its shoals and its terrors, Its perilous straits and its breakers, High o'er the brightness and splendour Of shores where the sirens sing ever. Then, shadows enmassed once again: And the river moving slowly, And the hills making darkness deeper. The lamps now fewer and fewerâ Fewer the red lights and yellow, Till only a dusky barge Moves like a water snake On the face of a dark lagoon, A stealthy fire 'mid the stillness; While from a weir in the distance Comes a sound like the cry of waters When the tides and the sea winds gather And the sands of the dunes are scattered In the scud of the spray. ROBERT BROWNING âOne who never turned his back but marched breast forward, Never doubted clouds would break, Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph: Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better, Sleep to wake.â Died at the Palazzo Rezzonico, Venice, December 12, 1889. So, it is well: what need is there to mourn? What of the darkness was there, of the dread, Of all the pity of old age forlorn When the swift mind and hand are though as dead? Nothing: the change was his that comes to days When, after long, rich, restful afternoons, A sudden flush of glory fills the skies: Thereafter is the peace of dream-fraught moons, And then, oh! then for sure, in the eastern ways At morn, once more Life's golden floods arise. Ay, it is well: what better fate were his? Why wish for him the twilight-greyness drear? He hath not known the bitter thing it is To halt, and doubt, grope blindly, tremble, fear: The reverend snows above his forehead brought No ominous hints of that which might not be, No chill suggestion of the ephemeral soul: Unto the very end 'twas his to see Failure no drear climacteric, but wrought To nobler issues, a victorious goal. There where the long lagoons by day and night Feel the swift journeying tides, in ebb and flow, Move inward from the deep with sound and light And splendour of the seas, or outward go Resurgent from the city that doth rest Upon the flood even as a swan asleep, Or as a lily 'mid encircling streams, Or as a flower a dusky maid doth keep, An orient maid, upon her love-warm breast, Thrilled with its inspiration through her dreamsâ There, in the city that he loved so well, And with the sea-sound in his ears, the sound Of healing waters in their miracle Of changeless and regenerative round, The strange and solemn silence that is death Came o'er him. 'Mid the loved ones near The deep suspense of the last torturing hope Hung like a wounded bird, ere swift and sheer It fall with the last frail exhausted breath And feeble fluttering wings that cannot ope. There death was his: within his golden prime, Painless, serene, unvanquished, undismayed, He fronted the dark lapse of mortal time With eyes alit, through all the gathering shade, With the strange light that clothes immortal thingsâ Beauty, and Truth, Faith, Hope, and Joy, and Peace, The garnered harvest of our human years, Fair dreams and hopes that triumphed o'er surcease, The immaculate sweetness of all bygone Springs, The rainbow-glory of transfigured tears. Over him went the Powers, the Dreams, the Graces, The invisible Dominations that we know Despite the mystic veil that hides their faces, The immortal faces that divinely glow: Fair Hope was there to take him by the hand; White Aspirations smiled about his bed; Desires and Dreams moved gently by his side; Beauty stooped low, and shone upon the dead; Joy spake not, for, from out the Deathless land, She led God's loveliest gift, his long-lost Bride. Oh, what a trivial mockery then was this, The change we so involve with alien terror: How lorn in light of that supernal bliss The ruinous wrecking folly of our error! Sweet beyond words the meeting that was there, Sweet beyond words the deep-set yearning gaze, Sweet, sweet the voice that long had silent been! Ah, how his soul, beleagured by no maze, No glooms of Death, i' that Paradisal air Knew all was well, since She was there, his Queen. They are not gone, those Dreams, Fair Hopes, and Graces, Those Powers and Dominations and Desires, They are not passed, though veiled the immortal faces, Though dimmed meanwhile their eyes' wild starry fires. Meanwhile, it may be, on wan wings and slender Invisible to mortal gaze, they gleam In solemn, sad, processional array There where the sunshafts through stained windows stream, And flood the gloomful majesty with splendour, And charm the aisles from out their brooding grey. They are not gone: nor shall they ever vanish, Those precious ministers of him, our Poet: What madness would it be for one to banish, To barter his inheritance, forego it, For some phantasmal gift, some transient boon! Thus would it be with us were we to turn Indifferently aside, when they draw nigh, To look with callous gaze, nor once discern How swift they come and go, how all too soon They evade for ever the unheeding eye. They are not gone: for wheresoe'er there liveth One hope his song inspiredâwhom they inspiredâ Yea, wheresoever in one heart there breatheth An aspiration by his ardour fired: Where'er through him are souls made serfs to Beauty, Where'er through him hearts stir with lofty aim, Where'er through him men thrill with high endeavour, There shall these ministers breathe low his name, Linked to ideals of Love and Truth and Duty, And all high things of mind and soul, for ever. No carven stone, no monumental fane, Can equal this: that he hath builded deep A cenotaph beyond the assoiling reign Of Her whose eyes are dusk with Night and Sleep, Queenly Oblivion: no Pyramid, No vast, gigantic Tomb, no Sepulchre Made awful with imag'ries of doom, Evade her hand who one day shall inter Man's proudest monuments, as she hath hid The immemorial past within her womb. For he hath built his lasting monument Within the hearts and in the minds of men: The Powers of Life around its base have bent The Stream of Memory: our furthest ken Beholds no reach, no limit to its rise: It hath foundations sure; it shall not pass; The ruin of Time upon it none shall see, Till the last wind shall wither the last grass, Nay, while man's Hopes, Fears, Dreams, and Agonies Uplift his soul to Immortality. THE MAN AND THE CENTAUR The Man Upon the mountain-heights thou goest, As swift as some fierce wind-swept flame; Thy doom thou scornest while thou knowest Men mock thy name. But thouâthou hast the mountain-splendour, The lonely streams, blue lakes serene, Wouldst thou these virgin haunts surrender For man's demesne? Wouldst thou, for peaks where eagles gather, Where moonwhite skies slow flush with dawn, Where, drenched with dew thy chieftain-father Is far withdrawnâ Wouldst thou all these exchange, give over Thy wild free joys and all delights, Thy proud and passionate mountain-lover, Thy starry nights, For that drear life in huddled places Where men like ants move to and fro, Tired men, with ever on their faces The shadow of woe? The Centaur. I would not changeâdid not the waters Did not the winds, all living things Proclaim that we, the sons and daughters Of Time's first kings, That we must change and pass and perish Even as autumnal leaves that fall; Even as the wind the hill-flowers cherish, At Winter's call: That we, even we, should know no morrow, For as our body, so our soul: O human, fair thy life of sorrow, Thou hast a Goal! DIONYSOS IN INDIA (Opening Fragment of a Lyrical Drama) Opening Scene: Verge of an upland glade among the Himalayas. Time: Sunrise. First Faun. ... Hark! I hear Aerial voicesâ Second Faun. Whist! First Faun. It is the wind Leaping against the sunrise, on the heights Second Faun. No, no, yon mountain-springsâ First Faun. Hark, hark, oh, hark!â Second Faun. Are budding into foam-flowers: see, they fall Laughing before the dawnâ First Faun. Oh, the sweet music! Child-Faun. (Timidly peeping over a cistus, uncurling into blooms.) Dear brother, say, oh say, what fills the air? The leaves whisper, yet is not any wind: I am afraid. First Faun. Be not afraid, dear child: There is no gloom. Child-Faun. But silence: andâandâthen, The birds have suddenly ceased: and see, alow The gossamer quivers where my startled hareâ Slipt from my leashâcow'rs 'mid the foxglove-bells, His eyes like pansies in a lonely wood! Oh, I am afraidâafraidâthough glad:â Second Faun. Why glad? Child-Faun. I know not. First Faun. Never yet an evil god Forsook the dusk. Lo! all our vales are filled With light: the darkest shimmers in pale blue: Nought is forlorn: no evil thing goeth by. Second Faun. They sayâ First Faun. What? who? Second Faun. They of the hills: they say That a lost godâ First Faun. Hush, hush: beware! Second Faun. And why? There is no god in the blue empty air? Where else? First Faun. There is a lifting up of joy: The morning moves in ecstasy. Never! Oh, never fairer morning dawned than this. Somewhat is nigh! Second Faun. May be: and yet I hear Nought, save day's familiar sounds, nought see But the sweet concourse of familiar things. First Faun. Speak on, though never a single leaf but hears, And, like the hollow shells o' the twisted nuts That fall in autumn, aye murmuringly holds The breath of bygone sound. We know not whenâ To whomâthese little wavering tongues betray Our heedless words, wild wanderers though we be. What say the mountain-lords? Second Faun. That a lost god Fares hither through the dark, ever the dark. First Faun. What dark? Second Faun. Not the blank hollows of the night: Blind is he, though a god: forgotten graves The cavernous depths of his oblivious eyes. His face is as the desert, blanched with ruins. His voice none ever heard, though whispers say That in the dead of icy winters far Beyond the utmost peaks we ever clomb It hath gone forthâa deep, an awful woe. First Faun. What seeks he? Second Faun. No one knoweth. First Faun. Yet a god, And blind! Second Faun. Ay so: and I have heard beside That he is not as other gods; but from vast ageâ So vast, that in his youth those hills were wet With the tossed spume of each returning tideâ He hath lost knowledge of the things that are, All memory of what was, in that dim Past Which was old time for him; and knoweth nought, Nought feels, but inextinguishable pain. Titanic woe and burden of long Ã¦ons Of unrequited quest. First Faun. But if he be Of the Immortal Brotherhood, though blind, How lost to them? Second Faun. I know not, I. 'Tis saidâ Lython the Centaur told me in those days When he had pity on me in his cave Far up among the hillsâthat the lost god Is curs'd of all his kin, and that his curse Lies like a cloud about their golden home: So evermore he goeth to and froâ The shadow of their glory ... Ay, he knows The lost beginnings of the things that are: We are but morning-dreams to him, and Man But a fantastic shadow of the dawn: The very Gods seem children to his age, Who reigned before their birth-throes filled the sky With the myriad shattered lights that are the stars. First Faun. Where reigned this ancient God? Second Faun. Old Lython said His kingdom was the Void, where evermore Silence sits throned upon Oblivion. First Faun. What wants he here? Second Faun. He hateth Helios, And dogs his steps. None knoweth more. First Faun. Aha! I heed no dotard god! Behold, behold, My ears betrayed me not: Oh, hearken now! Child Faun. Brother, O brother, all the birds are wild With song, and through the sun-splashed wood there goes A sound as of a multitude of wings. Second Faun. The sun, the sun! the flowers in the grass! Oh, the white glory! First Faun. 'Tis the Virgin God! Hark, hear the hymns that thrill the winds of morn, Wild pÃ¦ans to the light! The white processionals! They come! They come! ...</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS 1893 SONNET-SEQUENCE I Where have I known thee, dear, in what strange place, Midst what caprices of our alien fate, Where have I bowed, worshipping this thy face, And hunger'd for thee, as now, insatiate? Tell me, white soul, that through those starry veils Keep'st steadfast vigil o'er my wavering spirit, On what far sea trimm'd we our darkling sails When fell the shadow o'er that we now inherit? Two tempest-driven souls were we, or glad With the young joy that recks of no to-morrow: Or were we as now inexplicably sad Before the coming twilight of new Sorrow? Did our flesh quail as now this poor flesh quails. Our faces blanch, as mine, as thine that pales! II Out of the valley of the Shadow of Death Who cometh, through the haunted Hollow Land? On those tired lips of mine whose quickening breath, In this long yearning clasp whose tremulous hand? O, is it death or dream, madness, or what Fantastic torture of the chemic brain, That brings thee here, as thus, when all forgot, Thy body sleeps, as mine doth, free from pain? What is the brooding word upon thy lips O beautiful image of my heart's desire? What is the ominous shadow of eclipse That dusks those veilÃ¨d eyes' redeeming fire? O soul whom I from life to life have sought, What menace haunteth joy so dearly bought? III This menace:âof remembrance that must come: This menace:âof the waking that must be. O soul, let the rhythm of life itself grow dumb And be the song of death our litany: Let the world perish as a perishing fire, For us be less than ashes without flame, So that we twain our last breath here suspire, Here where none uttereth word, none calleth name. For in the Hollow Land is utter peace The magic spell which hath no first or last: But all that never ceaseth here doth cease And what would know no death is long since past: Only one thing endures where all expireâ The inviolate rapture of fulfilled desire. IV Where art thou, Love! Lo, I am crucified Here on the bitter tree of my suspense, And my soul travails in my quivering side Wild with the passionate longing to go hence. Where would it voyage, lost, bewildered soul If from the body's warm white home it strayed: Even as the wild-fox would it find its hole, Even as the fowls of the air would it find shade? Yea, dear, with winnowing wings there would it fly To fold them on the whiteness of thy breast, And all its passion breathe into thy sigh, Fulfil the uttermost peace of perfect rest: And passing into thee as its last goal Should know no more this bitter-sweet control. V Dear, through the silence comes a vibrant call, Thy voice, thy very voice it is, O Sweet! Yet who shall scale the dread invisible wall That guards the Eden where our souls would meet? O veil of flesh, O dull mortality, Is there no vision for the enfranchised eyes: Must we stoop low thro' Death's green-glooms to see The immaculate light known of our wingÃ¨d sighs? Nay, Love, of body or soul no shadow or gloom Can always, always, thee and me dispart; Soul of my soul, thro' the very gates of Doom Even as deep to deep, heart crieth to heartâ Yea, as two moving waves on Life's wild sea, We meet, we merge, we are one, I thou, thou me! VI âAnd dost thou love me not a whit the less: And is thy heart as tremulous as of yore, And do thine eyes mirror the wonderfulness, And do thy lips retain their magic lore?â What, Sweet, can these things be, ev'n in thy thought, And I so briefly gone, so swiftly come? Nay, if the pulse of life its beat forgot This speaking heart would not thereby be dumb. I love thee, love thee so, O beautiful Hell That dost consume heart, brain, nerves, body, soul That even my immortal birthright I would sell Were Heaven to choose, or Thee, as my one goal. Sweet love fulfilled, they say, the common lot! He who speaks thus, of real love knoweth not. VII The dull day darkens to its close. The sheen Of a myriad gas-jets lights the squalid night. There is no joy, it seems, but what hath been: There is nought left but semblance of delight. Nay, is it so? Down this long darkling way What surety is there for the hungry heart, What vistas of white peace, rapt holiday Of the tired soul forlorn, thus kept apart? Oh, hearken, hearken, love! I cannot wait: Drear is the night without, the night within: I am so tired, so tired, so baffled of our fate, The very sport it seems of our sweet sin: Oh, open, open now, and bid me stay, Who almost am too tired, too weak, to pray. VIII And so, is it so? the long sweet pain is over? The dear familiar love must know a change? No more am I, no more, to be your lover, But life be cold once more, and drear, and strange. We have sinned, you say, and sorrow must redeem All the cruel largess of our passionate love, And we, at the last, content us with a dream Who have known a hell below, a heaven above! Well, be it so: thy life I shall not darken: Thy dream, for me, shall be disturbed no more: Thine ears, by day or night, shall never hearken The coming of the steps thou loved'st of yore: And if, afar, a lost wild soul blaspheme, Thou shalt not know it in thy peace supreme. AN UNTOLD STORY I When the dark falls, and as a single star The orient planets blend in one bright ray A-quiver through the violet shadows far Where the rose-red still lingers 'mid the grey: And when the moon, half-cirque around her hollow, Casts on the upland pastures shimmer of green: And the marsh-meteors the frail lightnings follow, And wave laps into wave with amber sheenâ O then my heart is full of thee, who never From out thy beautiful mysterious eyes Givest one glance at this my wild endeavour, Who hast no heed, no heed, of all my sighs: Is it so well with thee in thy high place That thou canst mock me thus even to my face? II Dull ash-grey frost upon the black-grey fields: Thick wreaths of tortured smoke above the town: The chill impervious fog no foothold yields, But onward draws its shroud of yellow brown. No star can pierce the gloom, no moon dispart: And I am lonely here, and scarcely know What mockery is âdeath from a broken heart,â What tragic pity in the one word: Woe. But I am free of thee, at least, yea free! No more thy bondager 'twixt heaven and hell! No more there numbs, no more there shroudeth me The paralysing horror of thy spell: No more win'st thou this last frail worshipping breath, For twice dead he who dies this second death. THE VEILS OF SILENCE Three veils of Silence, Summer draws apace. The noon-tide Peace that broods on hill and dale, That passes o'er the sea and leaves no trace, That sleeps in the moveless clouds' moveless trail: The wave of colour deepening day by day, The yellow grown to purple on the leas, Blue within there beyond the dusky ways; A green-gloom dusk within the grass-green trees. The third veil no man sees. She weaves it where Beneath the fret and fume tired hearts aspire And long for some divine impossible air. Out of Man's heart she weaves this veil of Restâ Sweet anodyne for all the feverish quest And ache of inarticulate Desire. WRITTEN BY THE SEA Sweet are white dreams i' the dusk, yet sweeter far When the sea-music fills those haunting dreams: When light survives alone in each white star And in the far white shine of a myriad gleams: When from white flowers, that through the violet gloom Shine faintly phosphorescent, strange breaths steal And in the lamp-lit silence of the room The longing, yearning soul makes mute appeal: When nought is heard, and yet the tired hands stray To meet white dream-like hands soft floating by: When the disanchor'd mind sails far away Mid the suspense of an imagined sighâ 'Tis thee, 'tis thee, O dear white soul, 'tis thee, White Joy, white Peace, white Balm that healeth me! THE MENACE OF AUTUMN Amber and yellow and russet, gold and red, The autumnal leaves dream they are summer flowers: Day after day the windless sunny hours With feet of flame pass softly overhead: Day after day over each perishing leaf The windless hours pass with slow-fading flame: No song is heard where floods of music came; Long garner'd on the fields the final sheaf. One day a wild and ravishing wind will rise, One day a paralysing frost will come, And all this glory be taken unaware: Dark branches then will lean against the skies, Sear leaves will drift the forest-pathways dumb, And wold and woodland lie, austere and bare. AFTERMATH The herald redbreast sings his winter lays, The fieldfares drift in flocks adown the weald: The turbulent rooks gather on every field, And clamorous starlings dare our garden-ways: O beautiful garden ways, not grown less dear Because the rose has gone, and briony waves Where lily and purple iris have their graves, Or that, where violets were, the asters rear. Lo, what a sheen of colour lingers still, Though the autumnal rains and frost be come: The tall dishevelled sunflowers, stooping spill Lost rays of sunshine o'er the tangled mould, While everywhere, touched with a glory of gold, Flaunts the imperial chrysanthemum. FLORA IN JANUARY The goddess slept. About her where she lay Dead pansies, fragrant still, and the myriad rose: Adream 'mid the fallen drift, she woke one day, And the blooms stirred, seeing her eyes unclose. The oaks and beeches stood in disarray, Gaunt, spectral, dark, in dismal phantom rows; She smiled, and there was a shimmer 'mid the grey And sudden fall of the first winter-snows. But when, tired with the icy blossoms of the air, She slept once more, and all the snow was over, She dreamed of Spring and saw his sunlit hair, And heard the whisper of her laughing lover: But while she dreamed, the dead blooms had grown fair And Christmas-roses made a veil above her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS 1893â1905 THE COMING OF LOVE In and out the osier beds, all along the shallows Lifts and laughs the soft south wind, or swoons among the grasses. But ah, whose following feet are these that bend the mauve marsh-mallows, Who laughs so low and sweet?âwho sighsâand passes? Flower of my heart, my darling, why so slowly Lift'st thou thine eyes to mine, deep wells of gladness? Too deep this new-found joy, and this new pain too holyâ Or is there dread in thy heart of this divinest madness? Who sighs with longing there?âwho laughs alowâand passes? Whose following feet are these that bend the mauve marsh-mallows? Who comes upon the wind that stirs the heavy seeding grasses, In and out the osier beds, and hither through the shallows? Flower of my heart, my dreamâwho whispers near so gladly? Whose is the golden sunshine-net o'erspread for capture? Lift, lift thine eyes to mine who love so wildly, madlyâ Those eyes of brave desire, deep wells o'erbrimmed with rapture! FROM OVERSEA From overseaâ Violets for memories, I send to thee, Let them bear thoughts of me, With pleasant memories To touch the heart of thee, Far oversea. A little way it is for love to flee, Love wing'd with memories, Hither to thither oversea. THE WHITE FLOWERS OF JANUARY âThe aconites, and other white flowers of January, the spirits of the dead blooms of summer.â âH. P. SiwÃ¤armill. The woodland ways were white: the boughs swung low With weight of snow: There was a shimmer of dancing golden light, And through the glow The goddess Flora moved in sudden flight. But when she saw the dead blooms everywhere Laid low i' the mould, Her sunny wings she did enfold. Long did she brood amid that woodland bare And the blooms wither'd there. Then with a smile she called the snows to her There was a stir A falling rustle, as when bird-wings whirr Aloud i' the thickets in the twilight hour: And next, a glimmering shower. Swift mid the green-gloom fleckt with white, she fled: But where each snowflake fell There was a happy miracle: Dead pansies, wind-flowers, violets, once more rose, But now in white each petal did unclose. THE LUTE-PLAYER O Day, come unto me, Fair and so sweet! Crown'd shalt thou be, And with wing'd feet Escape the invading sea, Whose bitter line Follows o'erfleet. What joy thou would'st is thine: Life is divine, O Fair and Sweet! Death is a paltry thought: A little troublous thingâ An insect's sting! Beautiful Day, oh, heed it not! Surely I hear the rumour of thy feet, And Death is vainâdraw near, draw near!â Alas! and is it so? Farewell, O Fair and Sweet, For Death is here. WHITE VIOLETS White dreams, White thoughts, White hopes! Shy violets, White violets, In woodland ways, by the brook side, on the hill-slopes! Strange joys, New thrills, Vague fears: Violets, White violets, White kisses from the lips of Spring, white dewy tears. White hands, O lead me where The white Spring strays 'Mid violets, White violets, On the hill-slopes, by the brook side, in woodland ways. THE SUN LORD Low laughing, blithely scorningâ Beware, beware, of flaming wings, Love hunts thee down the morning! His white feet dip i' the hillside springs, He mocks thy flying terror! The woodland with his laughter rings! He'll make thee his slave to follow, Nor shall he forgive thee, maid, thine error, Who spied thee hid in the hollow. Too late, too late the warning! Behold the flash of flaming wingsâ Love hath thee now i' the morning! THE SUMMER WOMAN O wild bee humming in the gorse, O wild dove croodling in the woods, Know ye not she is false as fair, A sweet Caprice with bitter moods? For bitter-sweet her wild kiss is, And bitter-sweet her haunting voice: How oft my eyes have filled with tears When she hath bid me to rejoice! O loved Caprice, is thine the fault Or is the bitterness all mine! Art thou the quenchless Thirst of Joy And I the lees of thy spilt wine? Oh, greenness, greenness everywhere, Oh, whisper of green leaves, green grass, Surely the glory is not gone, Surely the glory shall not pass? I long for some lost magic thing, A voice, a gleam, a joy, a pain: Wild doves, your old-time strain once more, Wild bees, wild bees, come back again! SYCAMORES IN BLOOM Like flame-wing'd harps the seed blooms lie Amid the shadowy sycamores. The music of each leaflet's sigh Thrills them continually, The small harps of the sycamores. Small birds innumerable find rest And shelter 'midst the sycamores. Their songs (of love in a warm soft nest) Are faintly echoed east and west By the red harps o' the sycamores. The dewfall and the starshine make Amidst the shadowy sycamores Sweet delicate strains; the gold beams shake The leaves at morn, and swift awake The small harps of the sycamores. O sweet Earth's music everywhere, Though faint as in the sycamores: Sweet when buds burst, birds pair; Sweet when as thus there wave in the air The red harps of the sycamores. THE NORLAND WIND The south wind on the hill, And the west wind on the lea, But better than these I love The north wind on the sea! For the north wind on the sea Is fearless and elate: The ocean vast and free Is not more great. On the hill the south wind laughs Where the blue cloud-shadows flee: The west wind takes the mead With a ripple of glee: But the north wind on the deep Is the wind of winds for me, Spirit of dauntless life And Lord of Liberty! SPRING'S ADVENT The Spirit of Spring is in the air; The daffodils wave blithe and free To the wind's minstrelsy, And everywhere A green rebirth involves each branchlet bare. Already from the elm-tree boughs The jubilant thrush doth cry aloud; From fallow fields new ploughed The plovers rouse; In hollow boles no more the squirrels drowse. The blackbird calls his thrilling note; And by each field, and copse, and glade The leverets race, the rabbits raid; Where gorse-blooms float The yellow-yite pipes o'er and o'er by rote. In the blue arch of sky, cloud-swept, The unseen larks are singing; The green grass is springing: While nature slept, Leaf-crown'd, bird-haunted Spring hath hither leapt. O joy of winds, and birds, and flowers, Of growing grass, of budding leaves, Of green and sappy sheaves, Of rustling showers, Sunshine, and plenitude of marvellous hours. Thrilled Earth beholds her golden prime Returned again; her heart beats swift. Low-laughing, as the spring winds lift Their songs sublime, Mocking, she dares the circling Shadow of Time. THE SUMMER WIND The bugling of the summer wind Is sweet upon the hill: I love to hear its eddies The heather-crannies fill. It plays upon the bracken A blithe fanfarronade: And thro' the moss-cups whistleth âThe Fairy Raid.â It leaps from birch to rowan, And laugheth long and loud, Then with a spring is vanished, And rideth on a cloud! THE HILL WATER There is a little brook, I love it well: It hath so sweet a sound That even in dreams my ears could tell Its music anywhere. Often I wander there, And leave my book Unread upon the ground, Eager to quell In the hush'd air That haunts its flowing forehead fair All that about my heart hath wound A trouble of care: Or, it may be, idly to spell Its runic music rare And with its singing soul to share Its ancient lore profound: For sweet it is to be the echoing shell That lists and inly keeps that murmurous miracle. About it all day long In this June-tide There is a myriad song. From every side There comes a breath, a hum, a voice: The hill-wind fans it with a pleasant noise As of sweet rustling things That move on unseen wings, And from the pinewood near A floating whisper oftentimes I hear, As when, o'er pastoral meadows wide, Stealeth the drowsy music of a weir. The green reeds bend above it, The soft green grasses stoop and trail therein: The minnows dart and spin: The purple-gleaming swallows love it: And, hush, its innermost depth within, The vague prophetic murmur of the lime. But not in summer-tide alone I love to look Upon this rippling water in my glen: Most sweet, most dear, my brook, And most my own, When the grey mists shroud every ben, And in its quiet place The stream doth bare her face, And lets me pore deep down into her eyes, Her eyes of shadowy grey, Wherein from day to day My soul is startled with a new surmise, Or doth some subtler meaning trace Reflected from unseen invisible skies. Dear mountain-solitary, dear lonely brook, Of hillside rains and dews the vagrant daughter, Sweet, sweet, thy music when I bend above thee, When in thy fugitive face I look; Yet not the less I love thee, When, far away, and absent from thee long, I yearn, my dark hill-water, I yearn, I strain to hear thy song, Brown, wandering water, Dear, murmuring water! RAINBOW-SHIMMER To-day upon the hillside I saw a golden fairy; Her name is Rainbow-Shimmer, But for you and me she's Mary. For Mary is the mother Of all sweet souls that be, From the angels in heaven To the best fish in the sea. And of all sweet souls that are, Fairies are the rarest, And Mary was a star Among the fairest. She had a golden kingcup Her little golden head, For dress she had a daisy white Just tipped with red. She danced upon a clover leaf Still ashine with dew And the blue sky above was not As her blue eyes so blue. Her partner was a sunbeam, A partner wild and wary, Whose reel might even tire The patience of a fairy. Ah, how the two went dancing Among the dewy clover; I would that you were Mary And I your sunbeam lover! âStop, Mary, stop,â I whispered, âBe not so wild and wary, I know a little lassie Who'd dearly love a fairy!â But in a twink she vanished, The dewshine dance was over! Ah, her twinkling laughter With her sunbeam lover! But, hush! Her hiding-place Is not so far apart: I'll tell you where it is, dear, Its deep in Mother's heart. THE YELLOWHAMMER'S SONG Out on the waste, a little lonely bird, I flit and I sing; My breast is yellow as sunshine, and light as the wind my wing. The golden gorse me shelters, in the tufted grass is my nest, And Sweet, sweet, sweet the world, though the wind blow east or west. The harebells chime their music, the canna floats white in the breeze: But as for me, I flit to and fro and I sing at my ease. When the thyme is dripping with dew, and the hill-wind beareth along The pungent scent of the gale, loudly I sing my morning song. When the sun beats on the gorse, the broom, and the budding heather, I flit from spray to spray, and my song is of the golden weather. When the moor-fowl sink to their rest, and the sky is soft rose-red, I sing of the crescent moon and the single star overhead. Out on the waste, out on the waste, I flit all day as I sing, Sweet, sweet, sweet is the worldâdear worldâhow beautiful everything! Only a little lonely bird that loveth the moorland waste, And little perhaps of the joy of the world is that which I taste; But out on the wild, free moorlands or the gold gorse-bows I swing, And Sweet, sweet, sweet the world; oh, sweet! ah, sweet! the song that I sing. VESPER The wind of evening stealeth hushfully Where the high poplar trees gleam silver-grey: Born of the quiet hour, the sleep o' the day, Old memories throng upon me mournfully. Against the paling width of the clear sky The dark-green hill inclines its tree-clad height; The air is full of vaporous, tender light, The solitude is broken by no cry. The green-gold disc of the moon doth slowly rise Out of the dusk whence sounds the Angelus; O memories of hours long lost to us! Oh, bitterness of unavailing sighs! THE SONG OF THE SEA-WIND King of the winds, O Wind of the Sea, When thou sweepest abroad thy voice crieth, Crieth the anguish of living souls As with the wild storm-rapt soughing of the oaks. Breath of the world, O bitter breath, King of the winds, O Wind of the Sea! King of the winds, O Wind of the Sea, Hitherward blow, by our doors, through our souls. Blow, blow, Eurocyldon ... and as dead leaves Whirl seaward vain hopes and perishing dreams. Breath of the world, O bitter breath, King of the winds, O Wind of the Sea! King of the winds, O Wind of the Sea, Uplift us, resurge us out with thy waves, Out on thine infinite heaving breast Where not a wave breaks but is higher than hope. Breath of the world, O bitter breath, King of the winds, O Wind of the sea! King of the winds, O Wind of the Sea, In the sweep and shadow of mighty wings Whirl far this Dream that is life, afar To the Shores of Joy or the Coasts of Night. Breath of the worlds, O bitter breath, King of the winds, O Wind of the Sea! King of the winds, O Wind of the Sea, Before thee my heart bows, for it may be that Godâ Yea, that it is Thee, O God, who passeth by, Voicing Thy Word to our souls out of infinite spaceâ Eternal Breath, O bitter-sweet Breath, Lord of all winds, O Wind of the Sea! THE BALLAD OF THE RAM. Who 'as 'eard the Ram a-callin' on the green fields o' the sea, Let 'em wander east or west an' mighty fast: For it's bad to 'ear the Ram when he's up an' runnin' free With the angry bit o' ribbon at the mast. It's rush an' serge an' dash when the Ram is on the leap, But smash an' crash for them as stops the way: The biggest ship goes down right there that ain't got sense to keep The shore-walk o' the werry nearest bay. For Frenchy ships, an' German too, an' Russian, you may bet, It's safer for to land an' 'ome by tram, Than out to come an' gallivant an' risk the kind o' wet That follers runnin' counter to a Ram. For when the Terror lifts 'is 'ead an' goes for wot is near, I'm sorry for them ships wot sail so free; It's best to up an' elsewhere, an' be werry far from 'ere When Rams 'ave took to bleatin' on the sea! CAP'N GOLDSACK Down in the yellow bay where the scows are sleeping, Where among the dead men the sharks flit to and froâ There Cap'n Goldsack goes, creeping, creeping, creeping, Looking for his treasure down below! Yeo, yeo, heave-a-yeo! Creeping, creeping, creeping down belowâ Yo! ho! Down among the tangleweed where the dead are leaking With the ebb an' flow o' water through their ribs an' hollow bones, Isaac Goldsack stoops alow, seeking, seeking, seeking. What's he seeking there amidst a lot o' dead men's bones? Yeo, Yeo, heave-a-yeo! Seeking, seeking, seeking down belowâ Yo! ho! Twice a hundred year an' more are gone acrost the bay, Down acrost the yellow bay where the dead are sleeping: But Cap'n Goldsack gropes an' gropes from yearlong day to dayâ Cap'n Goldsack gropes below, creeping, creeping, creeping: Yeo, Yeo, heave-a-yeo! Creeping, creeping, creeping down belowâ Yo! ho! A CAVALRY CATCH Up! for the bugles are calling, Saddle, to boot, and away! Sabres are clanking, and lances are glancing, The colonel is swearing and horses are prancing, So up with the sabres and lances, Up and away! Where are we off to, say? Saddle, and boot, and away! With a thunder of hoofs in a rush we go past, In a whirlwind of dust we are gone as a blastâ For we're off with the sabres and lances, Off and away! SPANISH ROSES Roses, roses, Yellow and red; A rose for the living, A rose for the dead! Who'll sip their dew? There are only a few Of the yellow and red: Youth sells its roses Ere youth is sped. Roses, roses, All for delight; What of the night? Hark, the tramp, tramp, The scabbard's clamp, The flaring lamp! Where is the morning dew? Ah, only a few Drank ere the yellow and red Lay shrivelled, shrivelled, Over the dead. Roses, roses, Buy, oh buy. The years fly, 'Tis the time of roses. Here are posies For one and all, For lovers that sigh And for lovers that die: And for Love's pall And burial! Roses, roses, roses, buy, buy, oh buy! Why delay, why delay, roses also die. Pink and yellow, blood-red, snow-white, Roses for dayspring, roses for night! Buy, buy, oh my roses buy! A kiss for a kiss, and a sigh for a sigh! THE SEA-BORN VINE (A Dionysiac Legend) The sun leapt up the rose-flushed sky And yellowed all the sea's pale blue; The Tyrrhene crew Uprose and hailed the God on high. But Dionysos made no sign: The shipmen hailed their Lord again, Acclaimed His reign, Then stared upon their guest divine. âThe deep shall swallow thee, fair sir: The sea-things shall make thee their preyâ The God obey Or meet swift death ere thou canst stir!â âEre ye arose, my spirit bowed To the Great God unrisen then:â Take heed, O men, Your clamour grow not overloud.â âA priest of Bacchus thou! Behold: One sea-wave here could whelm thy Godâ His mystic rod Would float foam-crown'd 'mid this wave-gold. âAi EvoÃ«! thy voice might fill The waste of sea, the waste of sky, Yet thou wouldst die, Thy god supine on some green hill!â Ai EvoÃ«! the cry thrilled wide: The startled rowers shrankâthey saw With trembling awe The conscious waters surge aside. Ai EvoÃ«! The waves turn green; In tendril masses twist and twine: A mighty vine Uprises and o'erhead doth lean: Ai EvoÃ«! The tendrils cling About the shipmen as they swim: The Bacchic hymn The waves chant and the wild winds sing. EvoÃ«! Dionysos cries, The seamen and the boat no more The shingly shore Shall feel 'neath known or alien skies. Blue dolphins guide the wave-born vine To caves near mystic Ind: Only the wind Murmurs for aye the tale divine. Ye who deride the gods, beware: They are with us evermore; they brook No scornful look; Their vengeance fills our mortal air. Yea, of the jealous gods, take heed: One day the earth or sea shall ope And vanquish hopeâ An EvoÃ« be vain indeed! VENILIA âExspirare rosas, decrescere lilia vidiâ ... âClaudian. Along the faint shores of the foamless gulf I see pale lilies droop, wan roses fall, And Silence stilling the uplifted wave. And in the movement of the uplifted wave, And ere the rose fall, or the lily breathe, Silence becomes a lonely voice, like hers, Venilia's, who when love was given wings And far off flight, mourned ceaseless as a dove, Till bitter Circe made her but a voice Still lingering as a fragrance in dimwoods When on the gay wind swims the yellow leaf. ON A NIGHTINGALE IN APRIL The yellow moon is a dancing phantom Down secret ways of the flowing shade; And the waveless stream has a murmuring whisper Where the alders wave. Not a breath, not a sigh, save the slow stream's whisper: Only the moon is a dancing blade That leads a host of the Crescent warriors To a phantom raid. Out of the Lands of Faerie a summons, A long, strange cry that thrills through the glade:â The grey-green glooms of the elm are stirring, Newly afraid. Last heard, white music, under the olives Where once Theocritus sang and playedâ Thy Thracian song is the old new wonder O moon-white maid! THE DIRGE OF THE REPUBLIC (In Memoriam.âE. Z.) In the great days men heard afar the clarions of Hope rejoice: The hearts of men were shaken as reeds by the wind of a Voice. But now the roll of muffled drums drowns 'mid the last Retreat The wild fanfare of perishing hopes, the tramp of passing feet. The winds of heaven are banners lost, are pennons of dismay; The innumerous legion of the sun toils on in disarray; The moon that carries freight of gold to ranson forth the morn Sails desolate beneath a myriad starry eyes of scorn. Wild rhetoric, yes: but who shall say what metaphors of pain Are fit for the funeral dirge of a Republic slain? High hopes, faiths, dreams, great passions, aspirations, Prove but the trodden, useless, bitter dust of weary nations! That which was great is fallen, that which was high is low: The rising star has sunk again, but in a blood-red glow: The hundred thousand souls that died before the golden prime Did well, for it is well to miss the Ironies of Time. Faith, Honour, Love, the Noble and the True, These lofty words are pawns of an ignoble crew: How better far to light the Torch with flames of cheap desire Than thus to mock the eyes of man with stolen fire! There is no State broad-based enough upon the People's heart That some day may not hunted be by the People's dart: The rebel nerves, the rebel lusts, the rebel hounds of lifeâ If these be loosened from the whip they turn to fratricidal strife. Is this the end of all high dreams above thrones trampled under? Is this the tinsel chorus left after the noble thunder? 'Twere better, then, than thus to live, thus forfeit high renown, To be true men, and free, âbeneath the shadow of a Crownâ! INTO THE SILENCE (A Death in the West Highlands) Ungather'd lie the peats upon the moss; No more is heard the shaggy pony's hoof; The thin smoke curls no more above the roof; Unused the brown-sailed boat doth idly toss At anchor in the Kyle; and all across The strath the collie scours without reproof; The gather'd sheep stand wonderingly aloof; And everywhere there is a sense of loss. âHas Sheumais left for over sea? Nay, sir, A se'nnight since a gloom came over him; He sicken'd, and his gaze grew vague and dim; Three days ago we found he did not stir. He has gone into the Silence. 'Neath yon fir He lies, and waits the Lord in darkness grim.â THE HILL-ROAD TO ARDMORE There's the hill-road to Ardmore, Mary, Here's the glen-road to Ardstrae: Your home is younder, Mary, And mine lies this way. Will you come by the glen, Mary, Or go the hill-road to Ardmore? It is now and as you will, Mary, For I will ask no more. 'Tis but a score years, Mary, Since I bade you to Ardstrae; And now you are not there, Mary, Nor walk the hill-side way. Is it only a score years, Mary, Since we parted by the shore, And I watched you go, Mary, By the hill-road to Ardmore? WHITE ROSE Far in the inland valleys The Spring her secret tells; The roses lift on the bushes, The lilies shake their bells. To a lily of the valley A white rose leans from above: âLittle white flower o' the valley, Come up and be my love.â To the lily of the valley A speedwell whispers, âNo! Where the roses live are thorns, 'Tis safe below.â The lily clomb to the rose-bush, A thorn in her side: The white rose had wedded a red rose, And the lily died. ECHOES OF JOY Only a song of joy Wind-blown over the heather, Somewhere two little hearts Thrill and throb together. Ah, far mid the nethermost spheres Life and Death live together; And deep is their love, without tears, For they laugh at the shadows of yearsâ And yet there rings in my ears Only a song of joy Wind-blown over the heather. WHEN THE GREENNESS IS COME AGAIN The west wind lifts the plumes of the fir, The west wind swings on the pine; In the sun-and-shadow the cushats stir; For the breath of Spring is a wine That fills the wood, That thrills the blood, When the glad March sun doth shine, Once more, When the glad March sun doth shine. When the strong May sun is a song, a song, A song in the good green world, Then the little green leaves wax long And the little fern-fronds are uncurl'd; The banners of green are all unfurl'd, And the wind goes marching along, along The wind goes marching along The good green world. A HAZARD OF LOVE I count my gain a loss, If that should be to thee The shadow of a cross On thy felicity. But if, dear saint, there be In loss of mine thy gain, How sweet it were for me To please thee with my pain! Let, then, my loss be thine, My loss thy gain, sweet nun; Yet, dear, were 't not divine If gain and loss were one? THE HONEYMOON ROSE To pluck the wild rose in the morning dew, And dream of another Rose to wear it soon ... Oh! will she never come?âthe morn's half through, And dews don't keep until the afternoon! Sweetheart, do you wish that roses only grew In secret places in the dusks of June? Ah! here's my dew-wet Rose, Since here are you, Rose of my Honeymoon! IT HAPPENED IN MAY A maid forsaken A white prayer offered Under the snow of the apple-blossom: To whom was it proffered? By whom was it taken? Well, I suppose Nobody knows. But somehow, the snows Of the apple-blossom Were changed one day. A kiss was offered, A kiss was taken: And lo! when the maiden looked shyly away, Of bloom of the apple the boughs were forsaken! But whiter and sweeter grew orange-blossom! Now this is quite true, I say, And it happened in May. NIGHTINGALE LANE Down through the thicket, out of the hedges, A ripple of music singeth a tune ... Like water that falls From mossy ledges With a soft low croon: Soon It will cease! No, it falls but to riseâbut to riseâbut to rise! It is over the thickets, it leaps in the trees, It swims like a star in the purple-black skies! Ah, once again, With its rapture and pain, The nightingale singeth under the moon! BLOSSOM OF SNOW âSing a song of blossom,â Said little Marjory Brown: âWhy won't it come down, Here in the town, Please?â Said little Marjory Brown. âPlease, Wind, blow just a breath, for me To see The great white apple-blossoms blow Just like snowâ Just like snow in our garden before we Came back to town,â Said little Marjory Brown. All day and all night A wind did blow, Marjory laughed at the flying snow And its whirling riot: But at dawn she grew wan and white, And was quiet. And the doctor said, With his hand on a bowed sobbing head, âToo late you came up to town With little Marjory Brown.â THE DANDELION A thousand poets have sung the Rose, The daisy white, the heather, The green grass we lie on In summer weather ... Of almost every flower that grows, But never of the Dandelion, That the winds of Spring have scattered hither and thither! Is there any more fair to see Than this bright fellow Who, also, âtakes the winds of March with beautyâ? True his coat is a vulgar yellow, And his is a very humble duty . . Merely to be As joyous as a wave on the sea, A wave dancing on the great sea,â Merely to be bright, sunshiny, glad, strong, and free, As free as a beggar, as proud as a king! And so, quite as good as the Rose, The daisy white, the heather, The green grass we lie on In summer weather, Is that flame of the feet of Spring, The Dandelion! THE DREAM-WIND (Written for Music) When, like a sleeping child Or a bird in the nest, The day is gathered To the earth's breast ... Hush! ... 'tis the Dream-Wind, Breathing peace, Breathing rest, Out of the Gardens of Sleep in the West. Oh, come to me, wandering Wind of the West! Grey doves of slumber Come hither to rest! ... Hush! ... now the wings cease Below the dim trees ... And the White Rose of Rest Breathes low in the Gardens of Sleep in the West. TRIAD From the Silence of Time, Time's Silence borrow. In the heart of To-day is the word of To-morrow. The Builders of Joy are the Children of Sorrow. IN MEMORIAM (To Walt Whitman) He laughed at Life's Sunset Gates With vanishing breath: Glad soul, who went with the Sun To the Sunrise of Death.</field>
