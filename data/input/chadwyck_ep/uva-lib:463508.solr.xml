      <field name="fulltext">To my best Friend and courteous Cosen Mr. Benjamin Cook all good wishes. To the Author my very loving Cos. Mr. M. Stevenson. Cos. I confesse, and thou knowst I am one That never yet had tast of Helicon. Yet those loose ares that I did lately glean From the full Harvest of thy fruitfull pen, I here returne thee; knowing the so kinde Thou wilt my love: and not my language minde. Trust mee Cos. this course paper I designe Not as a grace, but soyle to set off thine. For I am certaine theres no eare so terse But will be ravisht with thy smoother verse. But hold, I must thy just applause refraine For that, Part of my bloud runn's in thy veyne. Yet they will pardon this poore God a mercie, That note how many Poems point at R. C. To the inimitable Poet, My honourd friend, The AUTHOR. But must I pen thy prayse my noble friend That were a task would never have an end. Ide have thy golden Poems writ in Gold Thy names great title in fames list enrold. Virgill no more shall Prince of Poets be But thou; Hee's but a petty Prince to thee. Ile to the grove where freshest Laureats grow And plat a wreath my self to crown thy brow. H. A. To my Ingenious friend, the AUTHOR And must I adde my mite Deare Stevenson, I know thou wilt accept it, well? tis done. Faith I can't tell while I thy lines read ore Whether I love thee! Or admire the more. Thy books not fraught with tales of Robin hood, But lofty fancy, By the Lord tis good: Thy sweet-lippt Muse most ample test doth give, Of high events, and I say let her Live. N. B. To my most esteemed friend, The AUTHOR. Tell me no more of Withers wilde abuses Thy book a thousand times more wit produces. Withers shall wither, whilst thy bayes are seen Like Daphnes Chapplet of immortall green: F. B. To his very good friend The AUTHOR. I have perus'd thy book in which I finde The perfect portrait of thy noble minde. I must confesse I once was one of those Did both suspect thy poesie, and prose. But having read thee too, as well as it I am thy wittnesse, t'was thine owne pure witt. And therefore shall even for thy sake alone Conclud, Minerva weares a colour'd gowne. R. D. In Honorem Authoris. Not that I think that thy Aonian wine Has any need of this poore bush of mine. But that in some small measure yet I might Exrpess the love I owe thee, I must writ And prayse thy fluent fancy that atteines To that with ease, which others can't with pains Many of these thy Poems did I see Drop from thy ready pen Ex tempore. And fitly cal'd Occasions ofspring wast For the ?? ??? of time flew not more fast: Did the conceit come even twixt Cup and Lip. It was thine owne occasion could not slip Whence Ime convinc'd that poetri's a spirit, Which except heaven infuse none can inherit. Thine yea thine T: H. A young Gentleman to his Lady, who lookt upon him as too immature. MADAM, I love you, should I not do so, I were an Anchorite and my Breast like Snow: Yes I do love, and humbly here commence Affection ushererd in with Reverence. Deigne but your-lilly hand, No bold desire Shall wing up my ambition any higher. Nay if that be too much, let me descry My rudeness chastiz'd in your scornfull eye. I must confess these early years of mine May look on, but not love Women nor Wine: Not love sayd I? who can but love a face So winning unless of Deucalions race? Yet while I love and in my breast enshrine yee It don't to pitty, but contempt incline yee. Nature will lend my lip a cloak, And than I may profess, I want not zeal, though man: My statures small, And Cupid cannot find Me yet; Shrubs loose th' advantage of the wind: Yet should I love thus young, I might produce Such presidents would warrant my excuse; And yours too, Sapho sum'd up all her joy In the embrace of a Cicilian boy The Queen of Greece lov'd Theseus but a Lad, And Cytharea her Adonis had. Nay, Love himself that God, is but a Child, Shall I then be for want of years exil'd? Yea I have heard fair Damsels say, In truth Of all that love, give me the Smooth-chin'd Youth. True I am young, and thence I dare approve My non-acquaintance with the slights of love. You are that wounded me the first and all: Blame me not then that come at the first call. To Amabunda. But dost beleive in faith that I Lov'd thee? faith thou beleiv'st a lye. Extinguish therefore thy desire Ere it becomes unruly fire, For thy flames work but the same way With mee as the hot Sun on clay. No thou must take thy heeles, and flee, If thou wouldst have mee follow thee. ? Fugis insequor. An Answer to the Song call'd faire Archybella to whose eyes. &amp;c. My dearest, Archybella's Eyes Though nere so faire shall not despise But owne thy loyall sacrifice. 2 Suppose her cruell, And a while Hir frownes like midnight, day exile Tis noon again, if you but smile. 3 Wee like our lodging and protest So you provide a faithfull breast To vow our self your constant guest. 4 Nor need you feare since you impart, Your wounds so fresh, but we have art And Balsam too, to ease your smart. 5 Let not a thought that death may give Molest thee, doubt not thou to live, If smiles or teares may but reprive. 6 Dread not my deare so dire a doome Forbid it heaven the hower should come, That thou shouldst suffer Martyrdome. The Answer to Well-well tis true, &amp;c. 1 Well, well tis true, That I have lov'd a fool and it is you: But since I plainly see Whilst I in pitty lend a smile, You make me conscious all the while Of your Idolatry. I'le henceforth squib your Wildsire flames and scorne The adoration of an Ass So foolishly forlorne. 2 Come, come be wise and dally not with Ladies charmfull eyes, The Magazine from whence Love armes himself, the Stars I say Are bright and pow'rfull too, but they Have no such influence. We set us down in Titans glittering shine, Reciprocating beame, for beam Where Stars their heads decline. 3 Whilst yee like fools to deifie us pump and dreine your Schools For an Hyperboly: Presuming that yee highly please Our Sex to stile us Goddeses, Alas we know yee lye VVe are but flesh and blood though our bright eyes Surprising your infatuate sense Yee deem us Deities. But since that Fate has drawn me to the trouble of thy prate Il'e not my labour loose For Il'e make use of thine own plot To let thee know I love thee not. Well, or ill take it, choose, And therfore Ile go get me a new bar, To rid my Chamber of such Apes Such Toyes as Sutors are. 5 Go love your wine, and all your Muses, nine and nine times nine So you will not love me For me I love my Dog, my Cat Nay I would love I care not what So it may not be thee Love you your laughing and your quaffing Crew I love my Country and my King But hate such fools as you. The Virgin Canticle to Gerrard. 1 Avant yee false Intruders that my Chamber hant Good faith I can't No nor J will not listen to your love No more will J though you would give me all your store Unbolt my door You do but rocks and senseless marble move For well, yea too too well J can your perjur'd story tell There's no faith rests In mens false breasts: Therefore farewell, farewell. 2 Tis true, I was so foolish once as to Love you, But now I rue I ever yeilded unto such an ague. But yet, I'de have you know my friend though I did get One burning sit I had another cold enough to plague you. For I who was all fire, am now congeald into all ice VVhence you may find, Though I was kinde. I can be merry and wise. 3 The willow thou thinkst torments me but alas poor fellow Ask but my Pillow If it can witness ere a sigh I fetcht. Or that on my bed-side as in a dreame I sate, Moaning my fate, Or out of melancholly my self streacht. Ile warrant thee my boy thou't find all circumstances prove That maidens too As well as you Can with discretion love 4 And now I do intend to run through Lovers row As well as you And tast the sweetnesse of variety. For I suppose there's some sweet sweet in it or yee VVould never be So much addicted to inconstancie. Therefore Ile set and see the messes usher in by scores And tast of this And that fine dish To the hundred and fiftith course. 5 In vaine thou temptst mee Paris what, wouldst thou be faine Forsworn againe Alas I valew not thy threadbare Oathes. Goe finde some other tame foole for I have no minde T'embrace the wind No, nor those vowes thou putst of with thy cloaths If yet thoudst have me, love thee then I prethee nere come to mee For I protest I love thee best When thou art furthest from mee The Choice. Tis not thy rubie Lips; nor Rosie Cheeks, In which my heart a full contentment seekes Tis not the treasure of thy golden tresses, That makes me rich, or challenge my Caresses Nor yet thy light-dispersing eyes though they, Be the true Phosphors of the breaking day, Should I serve beauties obvious to the eye Pigmaleons statue then would see the vye. And I might well (if I should cease to range,) Advantage my affection at the change. But I have suited at a nobler rate, Then to court paint; Beauties inanimate, In summe there's nothing out-sides can impart, Hath power to make a conquest on my heart. But J love you, whose beauty still I find But index to the beauty of your mind. You are the Pearl that highest value win, Being faire without, and cordiall within. To my Coy and Captious Mistress. Ile court my shade no more, but flee From it, and make it follow me: Nor shall the losty Cedar bough To the base Bramble, tis too low. Ile kneel no more t'ungrateful Thistles, Nor listen to each Bird that whistles: I have forgot you, and to day I did make Ortes of better Hay. I lov'd thee once, but now my scorne Shall triumph over thee forlorne: Ile wrap my front up in disdain, Nor shalt thou it uncloud again, No, though one careless smile would save Thy cast-of carkass from the grave: Thy tears, and prayers and looking wan VVere but to wash an Indian. Nay, wert thou fair as thou art not, Thou shouldst not move my breast one jot: Nor would I love thee one half hour, Though both the Indies were thy Dower: Though all the Saints should bless thy face, Thou get'st not henceforth one embrace: I hate thine eyes, and rather would A Basilisk should me behold. A longing Lady to her long-staying Lover. Tvvice twenty times hath Titan run his course From th' orientall, to the VVestern sourse: Since last I saw you can one parting kiss Sustain me such an age of night as this: How I am rackt in thy unkind delay? Come my sweet Phosphor, come and bring the day. Sorrow and solitude in this small space Have figur'd age on my Hermetick face. Go happy Paper be my Mercury, And having kist his hand bring it to me. That I may be thy Rivall; tell him I Must see him soon, or in despair I dye. And if he come not; I shall plainly see He's out of town, or out of love with me. A forsaken Lady to her Apostate. But are those flashes fled? those flames quite gon Into the ashes of oblivion? VVhere are those Vows, those Heaven-attested oaths, Seal'd on my lips the pledges of our troaths? What all amort, all banisht in a trice, All our embraces a fools Paradice? Then farewell faith, and friend, next time I find My self affective Ile embrace the wind. A mock song to O stay by mee— Stay not by me feinds! but fly mee, For behold I come All in furie, to conjure yee, To avoid the roome, O come not then near mee: your haggy looks skear mee But down to your cursed cell, for in hell; All such sooty sluts dwell. 2 Out yee Devills, worst of evills, What do you make here? Such dam'd witches, and base bitches: I nere saw as yee're. O come not then near me your haggy looks skare me But down to your cursed cell for in hell All such sooty sluts dwell. 3 Pluto's pusses are the susses That I here behold Drest in tiffanie like Tysiphone, Snaky lockt and old. O come not then neare mee, your haggy looks skare mee But down to your cursed cell For in hell, All such sooty sluts dwell. 4 Furies fellowes what is hell loose And yee broke out thus In your night-gears like the night mares To meet Incubus. O come not then near mee, your haggy looks skear me But down to your cursed cell for in hell All such sooty sluts dwell. 5 Out upon yee, Ile none on yee Down yee dam'd beneath Your ill favours and worse savours Doe infect my breath, O come not then near mee, your haggy looks skeare mee But down to your cursed cell for in hell, All such sooty sluts dwell. The Furies Answer. Be content Sir, we are sent Sir Not to trouble you, But to sport with and consort with Our own cuttaild crew. Let nothing then skear you, for weel not come near you But down to our own black cell, for in hell, VVe confesse wee do dwell. Jam jam tacturas, tartara nigra putes. A Gentleman to his Mistress that told him he lookt asquint upon her. Asquint, why not? am I of Eagles race, To try mine eyes upon Apollo's face: Admit I were, yet while I look on thee, Thy brighter beams force an obliquity. Eagles should do the same, durst they but try Their Birth right at the radiance of thine eye. VVhat is this squinting but my feeble sight, Reverberated by thy powerfull light? Nay should mine eye right on to thine aspire, 'Twould burning-Glass-like set mine heart on fire. But say I could, since thou thus slightest me, VVhat reason have I to look right on thee? Come be not you so cross grain'd to despise A breast that shews her crosses in her eyes; VVhich silently each other thus reprove, T'have let in cruell and ingratefull love: So passing fair, I swear upon a book You are, my eyes upon each other look As in a maze to see Dame Nature place All her perfection in your only face. As Clouds the Creatures of the Sun, so I The nubilous exhalation of your eye Approach your presence begging I may be The Umhra unto your serenity. And could I but my self in the office put, As Caltha with your beams Id'e ope, and shut. The Flies are buzzing where light Candles are, And smoak you knew alwaies pursues the fair. Daies d'enterchange Embraces with the night, And darkness kiss the lovely lips of light. Why then, thou fairest, art thou so unkind, To scoffe the mole thy beauty made thus blind? But am I blinde dost say; Even thence does flow, This solace, that the God of love is so. And squint-eyd, then I may glorie int. The sun it selfe, lights centre looks asquint. To Franke. What all at once? what nowne selfe Franke? Thy bounty over-beares its banck. 'Thad bene a favour yet beyond, My wishes, hadst thou given thy bond, And seal'd it with a faithfull kisse, O here had bene enough of blisse. Or hadst thou given thy hand in part As pledg of thy engaged heart; I had bene more then well content T'have fed my hopes, on the event. But I am now as others are, Suspitious of thy proffer'd ware. Thou art too sweet, to tell thee right Thou overcom'st my appetite. Hony's not for all pallats meet, And sugar oft makes things too sweet. Trust mee fond Franck, thou art too free (Free of thy flesh I mean) for mee. Thou comst too fast, I must step back. And to be short, I feare mee no man, Dares venter to make thee a woman. In markets maides are common, I Can have a score for a bulls eye You praise your selfe, and I could wish But to see her cryes stinking fish; I know not what to think, thy face Hath such an oleo of brasse; And yet thou shouldest be right, for none That I ere knew, lesse feare the stone, On whom be this inscription set; Here is both right, and Counterfeit. But thou say'st tis no vsuall Course, To looke ith mouth of a guift horse. Yet no mans' bounty shall perswade Mee too accept or keepe a jade, Ill favourd &amp;, ill quality'd; Who would on such Conditions ride? Thou hast given thy selfe to mee, dost hear Thou hast a shrewd box on the eare. Would thou hadst rather given mee that Was left ith maltheap by the Car. Thou shouldst have said, will you accept, Or else they selfe to thy selfe kept. Theres somewhat more then up and ride, The banes must goe before the bride And afer too, vnlesse shee bee Better then I can hope of thee Thou fly'st away to Church &amp; nether Bringst guest with thee nor yet a father. But for the first (sauing your jeast) You will your selfe be the bold guest. And for a father, what need hee, Since you will your owne giver be. Way this is the new way we take, Each others word &amp; bargaine make. Sure here is like to be good doeing When rampant toyles run thus a wooig, VVhy now or never verifie. Old mother Shiptons prophesie, Yet thou mayest get a husband still, Provided thou dost but fullfill. The last will of thy grand mother, No more but soe; Remember her: For my part, mee thou couldst not please, Though thou couldst sh? mee ninepences. Nor couldst thou move in mee delight, Shouldst thou afford mee every night A fresh &amp; sportfull maidenhead Their signes should not pollute my bed, And yet I may chance loath my life Come then and thou shalt bee my wife. However for your offer Frankey I were to blame should I not thank yee, But let mee perish in thy Curse If ever offer lik't mee worse. Thou gav'st thy selfe to mee; and Give thee back to thy self Godbye Te mihi donasti, te tibi reddo, vale. An Epithal. On. Mr. B. C. his Nuptialls. 1 Welcome most lovely paire, Through threats of drowning In parents frowning; Now no doubts nor despaire Shall cloud the clearer aire Of nuptiall crowning No counter-plots, no rivalls now suspect, Your wishes are ariv'd at their effect. 4 No woefull Willow now, Cupid composes, Chaplets of Roses: In which the Bridgroomes brow And his faire Brides also, Hymen encloses, Let Suiters in desires hot embers burne, Your joyfull fyres shall into Bone-fires turne. 3 On thy cheeks beauteous Bride, More all the graces In pleasant paces Blest hee whom fates betide Th' Elysium of thy side. This, this, thy lass is Sweet Bride-groom, but had Love had eyes to see her: No doubt but hee had been thy rivall here. 4 Sing Jo, sing a-maine Thy tempting treasure, Out bounds all measure, Give thy ripe joyes full reine, And Jo. sing againe, Victorious Cæsar Beware of surfets though, thy lustie cheare. Ends not to night, the faire lasts all the yeare 4 But you think long I doubt, And loves complection, Prepares erection, What though yee taste of nought, All day, but naked thought: Night's the next section: Then you shall act, what wee but dream, delight, Weed wish yee too (if there were need) good night. 9 Com Bacchus com let's troule The merrie dishes Brimd with best wishes. Mee thinks I see the soule, Of mirth in every bowle Presaging blisses. Your crop's full ear'd, full ripe, your eye discernes Plentie; what can wee wish yoe more but bearnes To my lillie white Leda in Commendation of a pale face. When red enchased in the skies wee finde. VVee strait conclude tis either raine, or winde. VVhen I a Rubrick on thy face espie, Faith I expect to see thee storme, or cry. Let them that dare condemne thy Ivery brow Tell mee how they could fancy bloud &amp; snow. That monstrous, yea that menstruous product, who Could looke vpon't and not his teares ovr flow? Pray tell mee where the white, &amp; damask rose, From the sam stalk both white, &amp; red disclose? Spaniells and Calves ate red and white tis true If you be red and white, pray what are you? VVould you commend her for her comly snout Thats particolourd like a radish root? You'd think I mock you should I say you are Pure red &amp; white as babies in the faire. If red be such a grace; If red so please Haue mee commended to red latices. Yet the red rose is Cordiall. But the white Is ever most commended for the sight. From costard-mongers I haue understood Thus much? The red cheecht apple's seldom good. Red waxe is very common, But the white Is virgins wax, And a good price must buy't, Pray tell mee now, would you be woo'd &amp; prayd; To limb your self out on a milke white maid? Marry com up; so when you are to write, You may condemne your paper cause tis white: Here, heres an Elizabeth, will you say what aile The shillings cause you see the face is pale? That were a prety jeast, Alas, alas, If it were cherry checht it would not passe. Even Vitriall admitts a various hue Some is pure white, some greene, some perfect blew, And some is red too, But tis then confest The drosse &amp; Caput mortuum of the rest In Mercurie as Chymick tearmes will ha't, The white's sublime, The red precipitate. Some Tulips I remember I have seene, Halfe red half white, but thy have common been. Or were they rate should they come near my nose The posie were lesse wellcome, then the pose. White Robes at Nuptialls, shew a virgine state, And why not white cheeks beautyes candidate. What wouldst thou think if thou shoulds red espie Exchequor'd with the white thats in thine eye? Thoudst say 'tis bloud-shot, How then ist a grace That blemishes the best part of thy face? But why doe I thus eagerly allude To that which all but blind men will conclude? The silver Moon, the glittering train of night, The Lilly, Swan, and Venus Doves are white, But you say Reds a modest tincture, tush, Her conscience can not bid her count'nance blush VVhen shee hath done the thing shee ought not doe: Come to hir then sheel blush as red as you. ? Rubicunda flat, Alba serenat. The Postscript, To the precedent Poem. But stay my whiteing, though I took thy part, 'Twas not to shew thy beauty, but my art. My conscience tells mee Red &amp; white best pleases, VVhite not set off with Red portends diseases: But Poets pro, and con, salute and slight: Tell yee the Dove is black, And the Crow white, I could have writ as much, and given a grace As ample, to the Calfe with the white face. Thus have I made thee faire and fowle; so truely Starch be it nere so white, comes of but blewly. To M?. R. D. SIR, Your safe returne unto mine eares being come I could no less then bid you welcome home. At present I have nothing worth your view, Only my white fac'd Leda, but shee's new And fresh attir'd, If I have drest hir right: Say but the word, And I have hit the White: Militat omnis amans, &amp; habet sua Castra Cupîdo. LOVE hath his tents &amp; lovers souldiers are Prest out to serve in an intestine VVarr, Cupid become a Leader now I finde, The proverb, verified, The blind leads the blinde. ? Cæco carpitur Igne.

A Gentleman that in a frollick would needs barb mee. 1 But BEN Let me know when Thou wilt returne agen: Oh thy departure drew a teare, Not from the watrie surface of the spheare No, no it drew it, whist, stay there Least while such newes I send, I much offend, My friend, 2 Indeed Since twas decreed Thou shouldst depart with speed I could not choose, but heavily look To loose at once my barber, and my Cook: I will be sworn upon a booke I oft thee wanted have My chin to shave, Poore knave. 3 And clip My upper lippe And make the haires to skip For having mended my bad face Thou good Lawn Bands about my neck didst place And cuft my hands, but now alas I shall, I am ith mind No Barber finde so kinde. To William Kemp. Saturday last faith Will you sent mee Sack By Bacchus scarce was worth the sending back Be now a trusty soule, and, send me White. Or Renish, which you will but let't be right Feel out some cell where Phœbus cannot come I know Will will send good if VVill b'at home A Gentleman surprized with the sight of a Lady unknowne to him, betroathed to another. Unhappy happinesse, peircing pleasing sate By too good fortune made infortunate, My blest, and blasted eyes made mee at once My self an Emperour, and a slave pronounce. What strange affections on my spirit ceaze? Whereof the cure is worse then disease. VVhat hevenly fire is this, torments &amp; joyes mee VVhich if I blow consumes; if quench destroyes mee? Take here O take this love-slaine heart of mine This victim fallne on your victorious shrine, Only let love since to your pile I come Honour my sacriffice with martyrdome. And tis enough, Since I cant overcome yee. Ile kille the stroakes my fates allot mee from yee Yet on my urne should you one glance contrive My ashes with the Phenix might revive, If not a smile, O yet let pitty lend mee A sigh, that may to the next world commend mee Where my then happier eyes may have the grace Freely to feast on your Seraphick face. To my Cozen Coy. 1 T'is not for vertues sake that you, Are wont to keepe so much adoe, For wee know by experience, And you by your owne conscience. That wenches will for all their sturres, Cling in a corner close as burres. 2 Those things most take men's palates ever, They purchaste with most hard endeavor. And thats the reason that yee maids, Hold up the rate of maiden-heads. VVhich if you were not coy and nice A lack a day! would beare no price. 3 Pray doe not yee your faces skreen, To be with double luster seen; VVhat is it but to tempt beholders, Yee show your naked neck, and, shoulders. VVhy doe you else pach white with black? But that yee more oth same stuffe lacke? 4 Cold-rounded fires, themselves contract, And are most violent in act. And I conceive fair maids desires, Are but such snow-environ'd sires. And when I see snow on their skin I judge them then all fyre within. 5 Tell mee who will do so mickle 'As shee that hants a conventickle. Shee is one of Adams race. That observes no tyme nor place. Though in the midst of lent it chance, Sheel take it, if the flesh advance. 6 And you your self Abstemia Will sport and play as well as they, I know you loyter but to be Embrac'd by opportunity And in things forbid delight To show your selfe Eves Daughter right. 7 Tell mee no more of Apes in hell Though th' excuse become yee well; Come prettie soule tis to no boot You cannot live unlesse you doe't: For the thing that we talk of pleased Nay more then that prevents diseases. 8 Were't not more wisdome to be dumb, Then word into be overcome? Do'nt wee in common queans espie These your weapons, nay pish, nay fye, That ere halfe the fight be done VVish that they may be over run. 9 Come come Girle if thou dost burne See thou bauk'st not a good turne, Those bonny lasses wiser are That know when they are offer'd faire Yet if shame bid thee forsake it Prethee play the maid, say nay and take it, To my pale Pippin Pallor in ore sedet ? Her cheeks are like her blind cheeks pale And wan, Her lipps are lick her taile, Her piteous looks may happily move Compassion in mee; never love. Shall I bow down; or kneel to that That seems to mee inanimate? So while I to my suite addict her, I pray with Papists to a Picture, Doe yee not see how meager death, Seems through hir Organs to steal breath And Succubus ha's from the dust Rear'd her to satiate his lust Tell mee pale Phebe dont you climbe Old walls to banquet on the lime? I know you love such festivalls Your white-washt cheeks resemble walls. Say mother pitous, doe you not For Oatmeal? rob the Porrige-pot Run you not into privat holes To break your fast with salt and Coales I might a thousand knacks repeat, VVhat could I name but you would eat In shame whereof your bloud refraines Your cheeks, And lurks within your veines, Vntill it bee subpæna'd thence, By your flagitious conscience. Nor are you lillie like, but sallow And sapie-contenanc'd like tallow, For when your dropping nose you handle, You seeme to mee to snuffe a candle. And they that keepe you reape disgrace, Whilst men read famine on your face. Natures, besiegd, And all your pores Obstructed block up her recourse Whilst in dispaire of life you burne, For a good husband, or goode turne.. There must bee vent, Tis to noe boot To talke, you must or dye, or doet. And should, wee but a while delay you, You'd cry harke harke for life wee pray you. You can no such improvement feel In allume possets or crude steele. You know your selfe theres nothing can, Be so aperitive as man. Who in the sweetest sence is said, To cure you of your maiden head. Which should you but a while retaine, A pessarie would come in vaine. What neede men care then for such wives, As Marry but to save their lives? He must as much (that weddeth thee) Thy doctor; As thy husband be. Noe, Ile to Bacchus where being come, The first attendant shewes a rome. The next prersents a glanceing lasse, Like Venus in a venice glasse. With that I knock, &amp; as some sp'rite I conjur up pure red and white. My circles a round table. And In midst thereof does Hymen stand With a light tapour. when I call, To celebrate my nuptiall. Here doe I a french madam place And there a sweet-lipt spanish lasse Here all in white a lady dances. And there in red an other glances. And least mine eyes want fresh delight, Here sets Claretta red &amp; whit. Nor doe I complement I trow, But tell them plaine 'tis so and so, Thy struggle not nor are they coy But I may what I will enjoy. No there's no coyle made for a kisse, Though melting melting, melting blisse. No shifting from the freindly cup But I may freely all take up. And in each face if I so please, Ile court myne owne effigies. VVho would not then on this stage act Narcisus, VVhere lively lipps so sweetly say come kisse us? Mrs. E. G. To hir false and faithlesse servant. Bvt whence false wretch are these delayes, Didst thou not sweare, By all that's deare. Should lyons block up thy assayes, Thy Pinnace scorn'd such remoraes. 2 Most faithlesse of thy sex farewel: Art not thou hee That vow'd to mee No fates decree nor Circian spell, Should keep thee from my Cittadell? 3 Yet flatterer thou art fleg'd, and flown From the warm nest Of my soft breast, And like that night thou left's mee gone Ah! who would such a traytor owne? 4 They that dare most, I see dare least Peter pretends More then his friends, But being brought unto the test, Hee turnes more cravant then the rest. 5 A feeble hermit raz'd the fort Of secresie Twixt thee and mee, O shame, Cowards I see resort To Lov's, though not to Mars his Court. 6 Thinkst thou the gods that testifie From Heaven above Thy vowes of love, Will quit thee of thy perjury? That were, to make themselves like thee. 7 Well I conclude then nothing else But love is dead And faith is fled, Unto the breasts of infidells And there, if any where it dwells. 8 False and faint heart adieu, nere sue Nor wooe no more, As here to fore, For here is all Ile answer you, False and faint heart adieu adieu. — Piget infido consuluisse viro. To the faire Mrs E. R. MADAM. Y'are lovely faire, and but I know, You are not proud, I would not tell you so. For my part I commend your sweet complexion. Nither for hope of favour, nor affection. Only since I have litle else to doe, I prayse the most prayse worthy, And tis you: Here's no hard words but in plaine english thus, Y'eare handsme, yonge, rich, vertuous. VVhat can be wisht for more? where nature places A heaven of beauty in a heaven of graces. But if you be as free as you are faire All's nothing, and you are not what you are.

Had Palynurus, never stear'd so farre, As India, where the earthes choyce treasures are. His wooden Castle. might have split in sunder, And nere arrived at a nine dayes wonder: Had Bellisarrus, and I, never seene, The faithlesse face of change's changefull queene' And to so loftie hopes had no admission, How blest had wee bene in our low condition? Had Athenais not Eudoxia bene, T'had bene no wound to be throwne downe agen; Had I nere sene you (fairest) then my breast, Had still bene calmie in its haven of rest. What th' eye nere sees, the heart nere grieves? had I Nere drank at all, then had I nere bene dry. I saw you but, and the wing archers bow, Drawn by the attractives of your eyes peirc'd through. My heart, so did hee from those eyes procure, His bolt, his bowstringe, and his cynosure. Unlucky luck, with joy and woe it fills mee, Tarantula like, it makes mee laugh, and kills mee. Tis thou hast wounded mee, and I must meet My cure in thee, O my sweet, bitter-sweet. Sic mihi res eadem vulnus opem que tulit. A. B. To an Irish Gentlewoman that slighted him. What time my bloud shall boyle so in my Ueines As I shall need a cooler for my reynes, Ile call on Jo. fairer far then you are Shall ease me of my Cod-peice Calenture; But if a Priapisme put me hard upon't Ile keep a Cow: And not an Jrish Ront. To my noble Cosen Mr. R. C. coming in mourning to be merry with his friends. And why in black? what means this nights array Since J am frolick as the day? Why comest thou thus in mourning to thy friend, As if to minde him of his end? In such sad weeds the unwellcome Raven come To croak out our determinated doomes: Shake of these mystie foggs, that wee may know, How much wee to thy visit owe. Come not as thou hid'st treason in thy shrowd, But lend the sweltring Sun thy cloud. So shall hee set him downe and slumber, while Thou cher'st us with thy smile; How ill contrived is that companie VVhere one does laugh, another cry? This man is cloathed in whit, that blew, thou black Even just like Jeffery, Iames and Iack. VVhat will the world conclude when they see thee In this sleabitten liverie? Wee laugh, you lowre, wee singe, your serious state. Seemes to affect the marbles fate, This discord is unmusicall come, come, Vncase unmask, and let each roome. Thou glidest through, so radiant appeare, As if the orbe of light moved there: Breake out bright Soule, &amp; give our wonder birth At the Meridian of thy mirth. Trust mee t'were good and rare, but I see plaine, Thou bring'st old fashions up againe; Thy presence was a banquet and thou didst, Present a deaths head in the midst. So all thy courtesie ru'ns upon cruches, Like him, makes a good feast, and grutches: But, prethee, shall I this a visit call? Suer thou cam'st to my funerall; Or i'st because thy clothes gainst surfets be, mementoes of mortalitye? Dost come to laugh, And set good chear to wrack, And yet bring Lent upon thy back? Nere fear good Cos. Heres nothing needs, Such overmonitory weeds; Wee have not to presnt you, what is rare Only y'are wellcome to our country; fare; Good powderd beefe, good mutton and good sherrie, And so, and so, I pray be merry, With which accept our hearts; wee could extend no more, should a'll the Gods descend. And if this paper find acceptance too, That's more sir then I promis'd you. But I had rather be abrupt then tedious, And therefore thus, and only thus, You come in mourning, but when you returne, You may leave of, but we must mourne. A gratus ades To my highly honoured cozen Mr B. C. Comming to Norwich. And art thou come boone Ben? then Norwich say, Thankes (noble Phosphor) for this wisht for day Then wellcome, wellcome, be they ever dumb: That say not now wellcome B. C. wellcome: Had I bene mute from birth, I now had broke, All tounge tyes, and with dumb borne Atis spoke; As Jove came downe the trifle to discusse, T'wixt frogs and mice; so camst thou downe to us; Both from above: though, here some difference lyes; Hee came from heave'ns, thou from earth's paradise. Yee both desend, being both divinely bright, To dazle our inferiour Orb with light: The country swaines' cause they alas could spell No higher title, call thee Collenell; Some wiser though then others, reaping come, Thinke thou art Ceres, and resound their horne. Devoutly beg thy largesse, and out vye, The thunder with the ecch'o of their cry. But when thou camest in at Stephens gate, Thou gav'st our city cause enough of prate; O how the people hurry, hurry ran, To gaze upon thee as lf more then man! What heards of Aproners at every looke? Read on thy robes Norfolks illustrous Duke? Weavers, like shutles, here, and there peep out, And make no workon't for the revell rout. Who finding how in vaine they strive for roome, Each in a sustian furrey to his loome. Returnes, And armed with his well try'd beame, Levels his passage through th' oposing stream; You'd laugh to see, how Taylours skipt about, As mad as dogs to see themselues cut out. VVishing theire needles had no eyes so they, (Poore theeves) might see their bellyfull to day. The that her from the top oth' house, seing all, Capers as if hee car'd not for a fall; But tis too tedious to recite the rest, They that were part oth Crowd can tell you best. O how they shrunk into each others arme! T'was a great mercy, that there was no harme: Their bodyes twin'd, and tounges lay never still, As if the rout had bene a twistring mill. In deede the Mayor, and all the skarlet Donnes, The bells too, and the thunder thumping Gunnes. Had bene your entertainment; but of late, Tis superstition and growne out of date, Nor had I thought t'haue writte, but your advance. Constraind mee, Orpheus. playes, &amp; trees must dance I am created post by my Theame, Like Memnon's statute by Apollos,. beame. To the worshipfull A. D. his Majesties Physitian Crossing the Seas. Accept his sad farewell, Sir, who here sings, As dying Swans do at Meanders springs; Farewell, Stop there; O how the surges rise, Into a brynie spring-tide from mine eyes? As if yet hope were left that these salt flowes Might lend you Sea room, or else drown my woes: And least you want wherewith to fill your saile, My sighes swell up themselves into a gale; If still be-calm'd, may you at least yet finde, The proverb true in this, my Words, are Winde. Meane time I shall to Æolus repaire, That he would breath you winde enough and faire; And then, to him commands the wavye Court, To chyde the Dolphins from their ominous sport; Next ile entreat the azure-mantled skies, To let their smiles, be your faire auguries; And may your thankfull patients, beg of heaven Health for you, Sir, who health to them have given If among us to rearrive you please, VVeel say, Phœbus comes from th' Antipodes. If your return though, be deny'd by fate; Live Nestors years in Avicenna's state. And Æsculapius-like confirme the Earth With faith, that you are of immortall birth; This boon I beg, Sir, and this only one, Now, and then, think on your poor Stevenson. To the City of CRACOVIA. Not out of Love, but fear of following evills, The Moores of India sacrifice to devills; So we to Norwich did invite Sir Thomas, Only for this, to get him further from us. To ? upon his giving mee a Library. How say you now? think you, I do not please My friend well, to obtaine such guifts as these? VVhat a whole Library at once? who lookes Upon it, must conclude mee in his books. To a Gentlewoman, that refused. A very rich Suitor, because he was not very handsome. Faire Cosen, let me in this case advise, To quitt your fancy: and give reason eyes: They that choose apples by their looks, are oft Foild in their hopes, and for their folly scoft. Tis not the outside makes the man, Alas A man's a man, had hee no Nose on's face. Your Lapidaries not unoften note, The rarest Jewell in a ragged Coat: This Genleman whose double duty serves you, For ought I know, is one that well deserves you. Forsake your eyes here, and trust to your eare, Hees sober, steady, staid, and fit to steare In this tempestuous age: hard hap betides Such vessells as have green heads for their guides: But you shall ride amidst proud waves secure, Hee being Pilor, And you Cynosure. I could both name the parties, and the places, Had bargaines foule enough of the faire faces, Nor yet is liking allwayes beauties child, Some have more wit then so to be beguild: Beauties a blossom, and so quickly fled, Tis scarce possest, ere it be vanished: Strike while the Irons hot Cos, least you find The Proverb true, occasions bald behind. To me the man seems passing lovely, Tush, His beauty's inward, Good wine needs no bush Hee's rich enough to make the world his debtor Love, and lay hold then, seldome comes a better. I had not writ thus much, but that I know Your parents own it, and advise you so. VVhose directory pleasure but fullfill, And you do well, though you do nere so ill: Read, and revise these lines, sweet Cos. least you VVhilst you your self make fast, your selfe undoe. To a faire Lady. Madam; Hard is the task to write to such as you, For if I give you but whats halfe your due, Such as are unacquainted with your worth; Are apt to say, I highly set you forth; Whilst these that know you, must conclude, with mee, Your praise above the straine of flattery. They that nere saw the glory of the Sun, Would think the Moon lights only parragon; So such, to whom scarce a good face is knowne, Measure your beamfull beauty by their owne; Whilst, saw they but your face, As in amaze Theyd worship, what they wonder I so praise: Could you (faire soule) but parcell out your graces, There were, enough t'enrich a thousand faces And leave your selfe such store, as (though your light, Have made them starres) you'd still be Queen of night, But hold my Muse, my paper is halfe done And I have scarce her story yet begun. But that would ask (to tell you what I think) A world of paper, and a Sea of Inke. Of Inke said I? Inke alas! would make that, A spotted fame, that is immaculate, No, I will rather never write at all, Then mention her, who is all-sweet, in gall: Hee that the Bow-bell of her praise would ring, Must pluck a pineon from a Seraphins wing. And write in Nectar till her fame appeares An anthem to the musick of the spheares But to leave what only my wish effects, My fancy to whats feasible directs; Ile rob the Swan of her white quill and then With the same pen-knife that I make my pen, Ile lance my purple veynes, and therewith write Her story, like her self in red, and white. And when my bloud ha's all forsook my veines, Let mee but be her Martyr for my paines. To my Mistresse. So love me ever all yee powers divine; As I love her, whom hope perswades is mine: Rich then and happie were I, thus to winne A beauty, Heaven without, and Heaven within. Had I the world (as Alexanders heire) Left mee, a patrimony high, and faire Enough yee'd think, yet I for all this store, Except shee whom I love, love mee; am poore. The joviall Journey. Up Phœbus up, and guild the horizon, For love, and beauty, are a progresse gone. Stand not to gaze, least thy too curious eye, A fairer Daphne, in this Coach espie; And thou great Prince of winds vouchsafe to us The gentle gusts of sweet breath'd Zepherus: Come yee auspicious Choristers of the aire, Let these faire Ladies see yee promise faire. Cherp up (sweet Syren of the woods) nere feare Here is no Tereus, come be merry here. And if the dust, it self too proudly reares, Some gentle Cloud rebuke it with its teares: Let the Earths green Plush, and floscular starres out vye The brighter Orbs, of the frost warning skie; Let every brook present some pretty toy, And every hedge be lin'd with travellers joy, Grant fates, no inauspicious hare may chance To crosse, yee, through unlucky ignorance; But as the morning, so the evening may Answer the beauty of a glorious day. Then Sun, Wind, Birds, Raine, Earth and flowers conspire A harmony, next the Celestiall Quire. And when friends meet, be your embraces such As lovers, that each minuts absence grutch. Whilst all that see, admire your greeting kisse, As if the body met the soule in blisse. Vpon a Porter Catching a Gentlewoman as shee past by him. Last night a Porter, standing by the pye, At Algate, saw a handsome lasse com by, To whome hee flew with all his speede to court her, I wonder, for shee did not call a porter. Still hee did hugg and in his armes enfold her, As if he meant to heave her on his shoulder: Hee wound her so, a stander by strait swore, Some gentleman had sent him for a whore. Shee cald him rogue, and sure shee cald him right Yet hee, shee should not goe, sware by his light Porter said I take heede, though shee be not, Too heavy, sirrah, shee may be too hot. Besides shee's of your trade, And free, shee beares As many burthens as you for your eares: Though with this difference, shee beares her pack, Vpon her belly; you upon your backe. Yee both weare baggs, distinguist the same way, With Fryers shee of black, and you of grey; You have a pad, and shee, for ought I saw, Was like enough to have a pad ith straw: You have a Cord you do about you cast Shee had a cordie robe about her wast: Both have your aprons. Say you have a frock, So shee haes that will rime to it a smock. Shees call'd upon, and calls upon her too Sometimes a Porter such a knave as you. But J perceive you well whereto she ply'de And had the fit come on you now to ride: If not, you are a lasie looby right, To struggle with a burthen was so light. At a Tapsters wedding. Faith J will tell you now a prettie trick, This Tapster, gat the wench just in the nick, Shee was; stay there! But why should I be loath To tell the truth? shee was, as light as froath: Hence I perceive, the Proverbs sometimes crost, For shee that's light, does not lye uppermost. Shee had been broacht a hundred times before, No matter, he had tapt as many more: Shee's modest though, as l'me an honest man Shee blushes, just like any Cedar can. And cause sheel be a smirking rogue, shee sweare sheel snatch the smiles from all the laughing bere, But heres enough of her, lets kisse the Cup And if her Husband wont: weel stop her up. As for his part, hee was so crank, his geare Out of his Codpeice, flew like bottle bere. But she hoping the worst did clap her thigh Close to the ? that nere a drop went by. She was a thrifty wench he got from Wopping, That thought it sin to loose the least tap-droping. I heard her say my selfe though he should fill her Up to the brim, he should not want a Killer: She told him of his wenching too, and swore Unless he left it, she would quit his score; Nor should he ramble up and down the Town Nor draw through any Fasset but her own Faith if you do, (and out an Oath she lashes) Ile find you out among your balder dashes) And if your tralops must not be forborne, Ile break your pots: And make you drink in horne. But t'end the jeast adding one more t'out passe it See here the Spiggit's marrig'd to the Fasset. Summer. Snakes cast their skins, and they are young ag'n Summers the substance, winter the cast skin: Summer is Youth in sprightly Æquipage, Winter's decrepit crasie, useless Age. Sol's aureat beames so guild the worlds vast stage, Twere small mistake, to calt the golden age; Summers all praise, what need it then a Poet to speak it faire? since who know nought else, know it I might imbellish summers sweet complexion, Call Winter death; Summer the resurrection. And when my tale with all my art is told, What will the world conclude my news, but old? Nor is it more then children use to say, A summers' evening, is a winters day. But Ile abruptly off, and what I have, Begun absurdly, as absurdly leave; Least I goe scale the spheares, and blinde with light Set in a cloud &amp; simply say, Good night: In prayse of winter. Honour and Age inhabit the same spheare, Winter is the antiquity of the yeare: Grave signiour Hyems, so his hoary pate, And snowy beard, denounce his aged state. See but how like a statlye traveller, Northward hee comes; Autumne's his harbinger, That bids the trees unmask, unueyle their creasts. That he may read submission on their breasts. Whilst their green ofspring lowly fall, to greet The potent presence of his stable feet. The gawdy bankes pack up alas! here comes No midwife Aprill, to unteeme their wombs. Nay here the showr'd downe waters, stand amaz'd, Rivers are Chrystallin'd, Neptunes hall is glaz'd, Spouts have their pendents, paultry thatch receives Translucent Chrystall, And adornes his Eaves. Læda's a fable, but I here presume To justifie, that Jove descends in plume. And that the stupid Earth may know he comes, The Heavens send down whole showers of Sugar plums. Whilst streets are pav'd with Pearl: Let summer boast Such pomp, such cates, and all my praise is lost. But here's not all of winter; you shall see His providence for mortall wights, whilst hee Locks up the graine in bosome of the Earth, Till Ceres blesse it with a thriving birth. How would the blade endure th' Æolian tugge, But winter guards it with his snow-white fugge? We may conclude his power, in that he can Enjoyne the Alps a pennance as a man. The saucie Dust checkt into mud, and mire, Merits no mention, our reports are higher: Summer breeds surfets, and infects the bloud, Winter is haile againe, and makes all good: Is beauty of esteem? then winter can Boast, hee abstergeth Summers freckled tan: Ladies so spruce to captivate mens sight, Borrow March winds to make that sprusenesse white. Winter makes men couragious, who dare Dance upon Thetis lap at midsummer. In Summers dayes even length, and lazinesse meet Winters are short, The Proverbs, short and sweet. Theres none so bad to be call'd dog-dayes here, No no we move not in so base a spheare: No scorching Sun offends, any man may With a good faggot make a Summers day. What entertainment to a winters toast? VVhat Christmasse, pray, can June or July boast? Summer alas hath no Æolian breath, To rescue his perishing souls from death, Flame-colourd hearth, even ready to expire, Looks pale as ashes, Sol puts out the fire, Trees strait are lopt then and their verdant locks Borrow'd, to border ovt the Chymnie stocks; Set out with trunks of trees, slumps, armes and all, As if the Chymnie were some Hospitall: In winter time the hearth stands alter wise, And men with hands erected sacrifice. Whilst in around the Priests of Bacchus sing Ingenious Anthems, to their grape-crownd King: In winter men at cold meat make a pish, In Summer they are glad of such a dish; Winter hath boyld, and bak't, and roast, Alas! Summer turnes men, as men do beasts, to grasse. VVinter makes warres of tease, who would not that If peace and plenty have no praise, then what? I might enlarge my self, but thus farre may, Suffice to travell on a winters day. VVho likes not this, a gods name let him run Out of Gods blessings, into the warm sun. Upon Yorkshire Ale. 1 Pox take your Yorkshire Ale, It did so sirk my taile That I had like beshit mee; Besides, so damnd a tumour Possest its divellish humour, As it had almost split mee. 2 Now hang thee tike of York, Thou giv'st us neither Cork, Nor yet convenient wedges; And know'st thy wylie wort, Is wont to make us squort Over a thousand hedges. 3 That men should sit and fuddle In such a sink of puddle And to, and fro so put her; Just such Ambrosia sucks A Company of Ducks Out of a filthy gutter. 4 For my part Ile get bay't And in my belly lay't Having drunk this dirty floud: VVhat ere my palat feeles, There cannot but be Eels VVhere there is so much Mudde. 5 No marl' such nappie stuffe As falling Band, and Ruffe Throughout the Citty, haunts it. VVhen I drink any more, Then call mee such a whore, As ile call her that launts it. 6 Doubtlesse the men are mad VVhere water may be had That soop such nasty gore. Some call't a remedy Against the stone, but I Have laid a stone at dore. To my right well reckon'd host at the Lamb. Mine host, or shepheard which is fitter title Since you keep sheep, though in the barly pytle; They say, ther's many a well provided ramme Comes to turne of his horne with your sweet Lamb The fallow Ewes when the Tups are fled, Set toot, and sweare theyle drink all weathers dead. This though, is much complain'd of, that you keep An old brown Curre to worry all your sheep. Nay more, as some report that have been there, There is a kinde of magick in your beer: And Hocus pocus drawes it too, or else Jt turnes your sheep to foxes first, And then A game at Noddy, Theres your sheep agen: Sure Circe taught thy Cup this cunning charm To metamorphose with so little harm. But stay! you keep a Scriv'ners shop mee think VVhere pipes for pens, and best bere, serves for Jnk; Y-have clarks too, and industrious ladds, for some Run, making of Indentures all th' way home. Else bedding with the Lamb, they rub their eyes And shake their Eares, and with the larke they rise. Jle come and see thee faith mine host, perhaps Bring thee as many guests, as thou hast taps. Then wormwood Succory, Scurvy-grass, &amp; Sage With Lemon, shall advance in Æquipage To humour palats, But for mine alone Give mee your dealing and your drink right down. Have at thee then (my boy) for a blyth pull, VVeel wrap our noses up in thy Lambs wool: And when our Cups advance a loftie hemme, VVee'l hum thee up John of Hierusalem. The Postscript. To the precedent Poem. But what? your angry, twas not my intent To slay the Lamb: or hurt the innocent. VVhist! whist for shame! least people as they passe Say, Look yee there dwells Ba?lam and his Ass. Come Jack be wise and thy self sober keep And thou shalt be mine Host, when they are Sheep Tel them the reckning twice twelve pence a peece's J'le warrant thee that thou shalt get their fleeces; And let them then come, and laugh thee to scorne VVhen thou hast turn'd them out, like sheep new shorne. Upon a hungry gutted Porter. No marvell Chapman falls so to the scrap, The first, and best part of his name is chap: Which if a man but spell, he easily can Perceive, more letters go to Chap, then man. Yet this is all but mirth, although perhaps He may conceit I take him on the Chaps. Well if I do, my frolick is to swap My nimble braine, against his nimble chap. Yet this by way of leave ile adde, a more In sitting poster never kept a dore. How should he ope it? for hee never heares If it be true, The belly hath no eares. E. B. To his noble friend, that gave him a new paire of Boots, and Gloves. ? Ods foot. I never drew on a compleater Boot; The blushing top makes me top gallant, and Me thinks I do on beds of Roses stand: Nay even the very leggs do seem to owe Their orient tincture to the Sonnes of Bow: Nor can I think but Jove-Lov'd-Jo's hide Was purchast, to compleat this Ocrean pride: Who having been the thunderers Curtesan, Blushes to crib it with the Calves of man: The wax was borrowd from the Lillyes bed, And the three Sisters span, and cut the thred. The Boot in the exactest mode doth set, All (in a word) from top to toe is neat. As for the Shoemaker I can only tell, For one hee never saw, hee fits me well. Your Gloves too make me spruse, as John a Gant Protest (sweet Sir) you are right Cordevant, For you have given mee Boots, and Gloves to boot What shall I say? y'have bound mee, hand and foot. A. B. to his shoemaker. Sirra looke to't I shall reduce your pride; Rip up your roguarie and tew your hide. My weather long shall apt a time for th' nonce To streatch the latchets of your logger sconce. You were too high ith' instep, I'm afraid, Your loftinesse will soone be underlaid; Crispine coucht in a shoemakers disguise, Cause none so base to cheat inquiring eyes. Yet to fit mee should Crispin come to doe't, Crispine, by Jove hee came but to my foot. And dost thou wretch to reach this head of mine, Muster thy brussels as the Porcupine Her quills' presumptious trash, I could afford, To send the challenge to the cutting board; New vampe your manners, &amp; more modish bee, Least Peter streatch you on a crosse graind tree: Where being once set up, tis ten to one, You'l find it harder to come off, then one: Villian avant, henceforth nere looke to have The lengh of my foot, since y'have plaid the knave. Noe noe, I view your bill and there I see, The very place where my shoe pinches mee; But make your market pray of what is past, Fellow beleve't of me y've had y'our last: And that the world may see in every line, I fitt thy foot, as thou hast fitted mine. Thus I in fine translate thee, goe, extend Thy base spun thread, to make a Coblers end. Vpon his giveing a payre of shoes to get the former paper answered. Silly, and sencelesse, knockt there heads together, To sorge a foolish answer, knowing neither. To whome, nor how, only they would b'lurt forth, Some thing, that men might see their want of worth. I'le bray you in my morter fooles, and then, Make yee a pastime for the worst of men. Incorparate yee vessells, base absurd, With Album Græcum, and the Divells turd. Compound yee up into a pocky pill, VVith C. &amp; G. &amp; D. &amp; Sarseperill, And Sassafras, whilst all that see yee, shall Say yee are rogues Alexipharmacall. I hope it shall suffice, when I have brought, Your bodyes into atomes, worse then nought; Some fishwives kist your fancies, taught ye prate The rabulous dialect of Billings gate.

Alice Goffe. A poore woman taken stealing soape. Why how now woman? what's the newes? belike You serve'd the grocer but a slippery trick. T'was very cheap, nay marry you must thrive, If wee pay ten, &amp; you get under five. But stay they say the grocer turn'd his eyes, And you stole, both the custome, and excise: And well enough you did, but a rope The mischeife lyes, you should have left the soap. You made wash way with't, being but a reach, But have a care, ith end 'tmay cost a streatch. You know the broverb, ti's as true as old, If the one chance to slip, t'hother, will hold. Alas you never could have stoll'ne a badder, Commoditie, Sope brings you to the ladder. You think to have't with a wet finger, but A cleanly theife had better be a slut. Come, Come, stay the hoggs leisure pray, I hope As good as you doth wash with Lincolneshrie sope. If you steale sope to make your clothes so fine, Youle bring your selfe, as well as them, to th' line. Yet I confesse, twas pittie goody Goffe, Stealing good soap, you came no cleanlyer of. To my Noble Friend. This after-noon your rideing Boots and bands, Your good-grey cloak, and Gloves came to my hands; The Gloves were trim, the Cloak most purely feeles, The bands, and Boots have tyde me neck &amp; heel. To the same Gentleman desiring my verses upon any price and on his sending mee a new Suit. Price? out upont! what price? pray doe you think? A peice of paper, and a little ink? If you like our poetick merchandise, Traffick, and your acceptance is the price. For mee I think it even in justice meet, So long as you finde Boots, that we finde feet: Sir in a word, your love returnes with ours, Our suit accepted was, and so is yours. To a Schoole master. In excuse of his Scholler G. Green. This duskie morne the youth was overseen Pardon good Sir, in truth the boy is Green. To my valued friend: A New-years gift. Had I but Mydas Chymick tuch, My new years gift should now be such Europ should it admire: But I Talk of Larks in a falling skie; In stead therefore of hopelesse pelfe, Deyne but acceptance, and my selfe Am your oblation, but alas! How shall this guift for current pass? Since what I here present unto you, Being given you long a goe I owe you; Since then our gifts prove empty dishes, Weel furnish them with wholsom wishes: Our first be this, where ere you come; May you but view, and overcome; Weed wish you yonger brothers wit, But that wee see y'abound with it. May shee that moves your amorous thirst Be wounded, and your pris'ner first; And let her unconcealed fires Foment your temperate desires, May favoring heaven, lend her no rest On any Pillow but your breast; And when glad Hymens holy twine, Hath clapt her Lilly hand in thine, Then let thine armes at once enfold Faire Hellens face, and Danaes Gold: May all her care, and study be, To love, and be belov'd of thee; And to eternize mutuall favour, Heavens make her such as thou wouldst have her I envie, any foes shall make yee, Be this their curse, A Good yeare take yee. A Visit. Last Fryday, to my neighbours house J stept, To see what Hospitallity he kept; Soon I espid his Chimnie like a Maiden In the green sicknesse, with her colour fading, Blushlesse, and bleath; only herein they sever: This a numme Palsie hath, and that a Feaver: Neighbour said I, your Chymnies to be let Why (Sir) quoth hee, you see no bill out yet; Well then, said I, to put you out of doubt, I guesse so, cause your fire is going out. To the World. Some say Deucalion made the World Repopulous, with stones he hurld Over his shoulder; On my life Tis false, Hee hurld them ore his wife; And ever since 'thas been the fashion, So to hurle stones in generation. O. P. to A. C. that oversold him a Horse repay him at the day of his marriage, he being contracted and to marry with in ten dayes: O. P. not dreaming of any such matter. Why how now Jockie? what upon the Catch? Had I suspected yours, 'thad been no match. Look how the Proverbs crost, you'r hastily bent To marry, yet not you, but I repent. How have my starres my credulous hopes still crost? You ride a cockhorse: I must pay the Post. Hence I the ereame of the conceit espie, You were though close, as hot upon't as I; But I had smelt you out, and stopt your course, Had I had as much forecast as my horse. What will men say to whom this storys told? But I and not my horse, am bought and sold. You have my monie, and I hope with it That I have paid for both your horse, and wit Whilst it must be of all the world confest, On your side a good bargaine, mine, good jeast. But don and past, I shall revive no strife, But take my beast, Sir, as you take your wife. Whom herein I presume I make my debtor, You, double paid, must do your work the better: In brief tis thus, neither better nor worse You up, and ride, and I must hold your horse. Whilst I conclude as sad experience teaches, Not only you, but your horse over-reaches; But 'twas so close, so slighly brought about, Neither my horse, nor I could stumble't out. Yet thus much might be spoken on my side, Selling your horse, who'd think you meant to ride? But twas my error to conceive you lackt A Nag, your wife I hope found one well backt. I might have lookt him in the mouth I see, Neither your horse, nor you are over free: My bargain, Sir, was bad, and you have done mee Some injury with mine own horse t'out run mee, But yet if your civility extends To this requitall, we are absolute friends; Since you are hee, whom I did so confide in, You'l only lend mee your old boots to ride in. Upon the name of the same horse being called Butler. Butler! why that sounds draft horse, but I see That thou canst scarce draw thy leggs after thee. But yet thy crafty Master laid a ginn And thou, and hee, made shift to draw mee in. But Troy will tell thee these are things of course, Synon could do it with a wooden horse. Pseudo Poeta in a paper of false verses inveying against Tantalia for her lyeing tales. Shall I condemne Tantalia, and not you? Her tales were false, your verses are not true. Be gentle pray, you seem to have forgot The proverb, whilst the kill upbraids the pot. Come, yee arë guilty both, of oversight, Neither your verses, nor her tales are right. Yea I could show you too as many slips In your false feet, as in her faltering lips; But I excuse yee both, for you perchance As well as shee, did it in ignorance. Veniam petimus dabimusque. Upon ? his Picture Prefixt to his Almanack. What base aspect is this? didst thou devise This haggy look, to be thought weather wise? Gypsies doe just the same, they get an ill And counterfeit complexion, that's their skil. But thou, as thine owne patron didst advance This front; A lye had need of countenance. Whence, by the by, no wiseman undertakes, The patronage of any almanacks. Yet I durst sweare, ther is, if truth were known Nothing in thine, but the fooles face thine owne. That preface false and foul nor is that yet Thine owne, but like the rest they counterfeit. But mumm, since I have lately understoode. That you with the fowre hundred prophesie good.

Prtest the lines are pittifull enuffe; Th' are somewhat shallow, but if thou wouldst keepe her Immortall, let th' ingraver sink them deeper. Thou, for the funerall, didst thy verses sort, As men doe sugar plum's, some long, some short: 'Twas goodluck though, they to thearse were pin'd Else being lame tha'd sure been left behin'd: But have a care, least with affront you greet. The collenell, to send his wife a sheet; Sure shee was rich enough, to leave behinde her Other gate stuffe, then thy fowle sheet, to wind her. Did'st thou intend this sing song to her honour? Thoud'st plaid the Sexton, &amp; thrown dirt upon her. Thou shouldst have lighted too thy dismall dashes At the next torch, and cry'd ashes to ashes: Then, as her preist, or poet choose you whether, Thou'dst bury'd fame, and body both together. Had'st thou soopt sack, it would have brought thy chymes, In better tune and tought thee loftier ry'mes. But ah! thy, muddy fancy showes me clear. Thou stood'st among the beggers, serv'd with bear. Thou'dst better brooke an elegiak jeast, And made an affidavit mortua est, Yet 'twas well done t'avouch it with thy name, Least honest men should suffer for thy shame. Thou say'st thy belly shakd when thou didst writ, I think so too, the divel a verse was right. When my ill fortune's dead, and I would laugh, He send for thee to jerke an Epitaph.

Doubtlesse, yee'd not have dig'd so deepe a pitt, Had yee but dream't your selves should hansell it: Bow black was this eclypse? what mean't yee by't? A flame, and yet no light; twas hell fire right.

Twere secriledge, and just such, to bereave Diana of a Nimph, without her leave. Or steal a starre from off his region Whilst Phebe slept with her Endymion. I had been fellon to your honours bloud And stolne a cignet from that royall floud. Had not your grace first given me my book The golden Scepter of your gracious look. But now with humble confidence I resort To this faire stream, having your warrant for't Only let me beseech your honour that You'd ratifie it with a second date. Then being armd with this encouragement My next addresse is to the Lady bent: My fortunes balance, on whose only breath, Depends the sentence of my life, or death. If such a match felicitate my life, Ile treat her as my Mistresse though my wife. Ile study what may please her, and contend, With fate, to make her happie to the end. As for you gratious madam) deigne mee still, The clear beames of your ladyships good will: So shall I be assur'd what I commence. Shall riyne in such sun light influence: Meane while no thought shall from my breast arise But what I dare present as sacrifice. Thus J returne my selfe to both, whilst shee.

Where is the fresh gloss, is this the lively red? You spake of? tush tis saded, fled, and dead. A lack and well a day the weaver said, How dearly have J for this colour paid? And yet it gives you no content, but J, Poore J must let, must leave my work and die. Ah! mee impartiall death where thou dost come, Thou either curst of, or concludst the thrum. My beame is strong, but strengh will not prevaile Golyah's speare stout as my beame did faile: My nimble shuttle flitting here, and there, Presents my life's in stable character: Mark but how swift it to its exit tendes, So fleetly fly wee all unto our our ends: Jt puts but forth, and at its port arives, So doth our death begin even with our lives. My globe like wheel about its pole is hurld, Just as the heavens are rapt about the world. And turning to my filling boy behind me, His winding pipes, does of my wind pipe mind mee. Jf hee stand still J must not work, if the aire, Fill not my pipes my work will soon impaire, A constant motion to my trade belongs, So nature hath her loome, my breast, my lungs. My blouds' her posting shutle swiftly flies, Through the strait conduits of my arteries. My purple veines her warping is, my haire My tendons find, my nerves her tackling are. My solid parts, my able bones are some, Appointed beames, some holdfasts of her loome. And thus in there owne lomes doe all men weave, And women too from cradle to theire grave. Nor cease wee all above a minites breath, Till wee be turned out of worke by death. Thus from those instruments by which Jearnt My livelyhood, to dye I likewise learnt. I looke but on my eyes, And I can read, In them the seperation of my thread. In laying of my coulours, still I found, The lowest, a memento of the ground. The fashions teach mee since they keep no stay, The fashion of this world passesaway, Come then and wellcome death I have enough Of this vaine world, its fraile, and druggie stuffe. Can tempt mine eyes no more, come fetch me home Ile give my life, for death; my loome for lome To Constantia Let others ply the oares t'wixt doubts and feares, For I am past those rocks, those tydes of tears. My sullen starre is fallen, warr's past, and I Laiden with trophies of my victorie. How doe I blesse my fate that I did meet? With one so faire, so faithfull, and so sweet. My humble knee bowes henceforth to no shrine, (Though Venus were thy rivall) but to thine. Happy my dearest, happie hee may lye, Vnder the tropick of thy gracious eye. Nothing but death shall my firme faith remove, Nothing but the cold flore shall coole my love. The Gordeon knot that could not be unty'd By art, did Alexanders sword divide. Our love knot's faster, nor shall armes, nor arts Vnlink the chain of our vnited hearts. The noon-eyd sun may chance run retrograde, And as a Daphne follow his own shade. Heaven may descend to earth, And earth aspire To Heaven. And water be at peace with fire, Fishes and fowles may change their elements, And take a glory in their new contents. But when I faile, but when I cease to love, The center shall from its fixt base remove, VVhen I divid the thread our loves have spun, The streames shall back upon there fountaines run. This I conclude a possibiltie, J may forget my name; but never thee. Ceres cickle; whether art thou gone. See'st not our hopes into full harvest growne? Come boonest Bacchus, come let's have a health, To our best wishes; love hath store of wealth. View here our vintage, see our blest increase, Of swelling grapes that only want the presse. Hast Hymen hast, for wee must find in you, The end of our desires and verses too. To Bovino. You bull it Sir, as if you meant a prize, VVith milo at the bovine exercise. Push forwards your good motion Sir, you may, Encrease my landlords cornucopia. But to speake naked truth they say that you, Doe not run to the bull, but to the cow. VVhere you your selfe in manner of a bull, Doe give Europa her white belly full. And as tis fit you should haveing gone halves In getting, now you help to keepe the Calves. But have a care St. Stephens wide gates are near, You'l run your selfe out ere you be aware. The FLEETS. My wishes greet The Navie of the Dutch The English fleet Il all good fortunes grutch May no stormes tosse Vantrump and his Sea forces The Harp and Crosse Shall have my daily curses Smile gentle fate Upon the Dutch and Dane Upon our State VVait their eternall bane: Attend all health The Cavalering part This Common wealth. I vallew not a fart. To a drunken Porter reeling into the Ring to wrastle with a Taylor. Hey hey pot-valiant Porter, friend, I feare, That you have somewhat more then you can beare. You make mee laugh to see you face and crack, You puppie, I could beare you on my back. Out of the Ring unlesse you were more stout: The Taylor swears heel fling, or cut you out. You stand so waving and so tottering, As if there were an Earth-quake in the Ring. And eye the Taylor, as you would adore him, Y'are so devout you scarce can stand before him. Do you not heare him say it shall go hard But at the first touch hee'l turne up your yard. Nor will he use a quarter of his strength To measure all your quarters out at length. See but his active stout, and able limb, Porter I see youl never carry him. Go wrastle with yond tree you dizzie crowne, More need to hold you up, then hu le you downe. Had you as many leggs as any louse The eyes of Argus, Hands of Bryarcus, All would not do it, for like Polypheme, You would be run down in this drunken dreame. And in the turning of a hand be found As sure as louse in bosome, on the ground. Cord first his hands and feet, Then if you can, Stand toot, and throw the ninth part of a man: But your athletick art's not worth the trying Go go a man may see where you've been plying Brave sport, a Porter, and his fox turnd loose T'encounter with a Taylor and his goose Thus I perceive 'tis fatall to us all After a Iustie cup to take a fall. To a Brewer that promised mee a Staggs Tongue, and dissapointed me. Now your Æsopick markets Sir, what? you'l Your selfe be Brewer, and make mee the fool, Faith Sir you should not need your word to break Ime sure your beere wont make a Cat to speak. Come come let's hat, without a tongue, I vow That I will never speak good word of you. Are you so politick to think by failing Mee of my tongue, you do prevent my rayling? Beleeve it not, Sir, I can cant my wrong Like injurd Phylomel without a tongue. Tongues are unruly members but I see That you can rule yours, where it should befree. Thus to be fool'd, and bafled all a long, Twould make one speak that had but half a tongue But I perceive the reason now my friend Your tongue is fast by the roots ith Chimnyes end. I must for peace sake, pocket up this wrong And keep my hands of, because you keep your tongue. The tongues a two edgd sword, and by the cup Of my contempt, J scarce can put it up May the Staggs hornes be grafted on your head Till J have the Stags tongue you promised. My furie flames J feare J shall ere long Like Dives need your cooler for my tongue For it begins J see to teare, and rend Just like a womans tongue that knows no end Brewer be sure then that you stand aloof Unlesse you bring your tongue under my roofe May be you'l say, that you have none, but J Am sure y't one have told me a divillish lye. Thus am J faine to vindicate my wrong Jn writing, because I have lost my tongue. Jam pateris telis vulnera facta tuis. To this Brewer sending mee halfe a dozen tongues. Wee judge it just that we distend our lungs In gratitude to you that sent us tongues. Wee were a little too long tongu'd but you Have made the tongues fit for our mouths Sir, now. You seem to make us double tongud, for wee Expected but the halfe of what wee see. Our skill in Phisick sayes the Staggs did die Of feavers for the tongues were hot and drie, But wee to wash down such conceits, did make Them swim in best Beer for the Brewers sake. The beasts that lost them should not be more brute Then wee, if we should offer to be mute. And where as wanting tongues we could allow But paper praise, we cry a largesse now. Thanks then thrice bounteous Sir, Twere sin if we should be tongue-tyde, where your tongues are so free. To a Gentleman that promised, but failed, to meet mee at an Ale-drapers. Now halfe an hower past six, and more, &amp; faile: Your friend, a second time? Come give us ale: Are you all dissappointment, is your frame, And fabrick only such? Go fetch the same. VVhat! was I borne to wait? upon my soule You wrong my patience; woman, fetch a Rowle. Your actions are unhandsome, without baile Or mainprize, y'are condemn'd, go fetch more Ale: Shall we loose such a morning such fair weather? Go (faith) even fetch a brace of pots together. Look, if he come yet; we are sure of these? Not yet in sight? goe fetch the Holland Cheese, What? you don't see him yet; well, we must call For t'other dish of Ale, to wash downe all. March in my black-brow'd pots; untill ye stand Before mee, like an Æthiopian band. Faith, I am now in, goe to, trye, if yee Eclipsed beauties, be good leachery. Come then, and give me lip roome, shall I not Kisse your black lipps? why? Ladyes kisse the pot. Yes I must kisse, and friends: for it appeares My wrath hath made me pull ye by the Eares. Excuse me, pray, if I my selfe forgot, For all the world can tell, I love the pot. And therefore this doth my content be get, Though I had no luck, I had pot-luck yet. To an other Gentleman, that served me such a trick. Not yet, nor yet, and yet the Chymes done going? Some Beer, and Sugar boy! come, let's be doing; My expectations big, come fill away, Hope is an Anchor, Anchors make us stay. Hamborough like, untill the Clock strike few I mean to drink, videlicet till two; Nay I'me resolved, if I be alive, Since I am in, I will not out till five: Then never grutch at what so e're you heare I am no waiter, but where there's good cheare. Sir, I am none of those, that can digest Hopes false conception; Boy, fetch the best. Hope is my issue, wherein I'm beguild, You got it, pray, then answer for the child; If not, you must, nay (faith) you shall, be witting To pay the Nurse; And that is just two shilling. To a Philomuse from whom I received a Paper upon the same Subject and by the same Post. Well my good Cos. what the same fish That J was frying? faith i'de wish To meet the oftner in my dish: The proverbs, good witts jump, we both design'd The plot, yet neither knew each others minde. But didst not think it strange to see, My part borne in thy Symphonie? Trust mee I marvelld much at thee, Nay under Morpheus you complaine your Muse, Mine under Saturne, Not a pin to choose. Well fare thy pen! recald to light This plot, that else had slept in night; (As dark as Faux his Lanthron) might (Should we neglect such mercy) us include In as high treason, deep ingratitude. Ben god a mercy for thy sonnet, Let all Papists descant on it; Whilst all Protestants vaile the Bonnet: But for this time ile let thy praise alone, Least having writ too: I bespeak mine own. At the Florists Feast in Norwich Flora wearing a Crown. Gentlemen welcome Flora sayes so too, For shee had had no feast now, but for you; Once in a yeare Appollo deigns a smile, And gravity it selfe admits a guile; Mechanicks have their meetings, and as oft, As the snake tooth to taile turnes, sing a loft. Bibbers Carowse it to the god of Wine, And everie bird will have his valentine. But I had sav'd my labour of the rest, Had I first said, each Angel hath his Feast. How I have been neglected of late yeares, To you, whom I my judges make, appeares; I shall not stand to tell you, since the seeds Of discord, I am overgrowne with weeds; And justly verifie the jokes of those Who say, between two nettles sits a rose. Am not I Queene of Zephyr's familie? And my rich traine, the earths embroderie Are not my daughters the Olympian eyes? VVhose more then terrene luster, stellifies The muddy face of Ops, courting your view VVith colours, such as Ixis never knew. VVitness the feilds, luxurious in my smile, Presents the country every day a guile. But tush! I come not here, to feast your eyes VVith simples, such as rustick fopperies: For what alas! are bottles blew, or white, Or travellers joy, to cittizens delight? Hence, rustickes, hence yee petty plumes of May, Though we'lth and beauty of the spring, away; This feast fars not with you, noe these are they Shall crowne the tryumph of faire Floras day: The lilly and the rose, shall not be seene Amongst us, though of flowers the King, &amp; Queene. Nor th. humble violet, These, most lively, wee Can in the garden of your vertues see. Hence goldy-locks, though hand maid of the sun, Here's no roome for a pot companion; Save such whose pots puft up with richest earth, Are the lucina's of a nobler birth, The immortall Amaranth, shall not here be showne Nor hee, who fancy'd no face but his owne: These are our toyes, our trifles, But now, wee Come to uncabinet our treasurie. The lustie and the country gallant too, As pledges of our loves present wee you. The Spanish, French, and Welch infantes we Commend for their unmatcht varietie. The painted Lady, (think it though no taint Vnto her beauty, for tis natures paint) The rare Diana, not shee whome we find In the wild woods, noe, this is garden kinde; On whom a man may looke, and, smiles importune, Without the danger of a horned fortune. Next this sweet dame, There's the Begrovenere, The lovely Comans, The peerlesse Grampeere, Speckemakers white, Taunies cumbers cornation Are flowers which nothing want but admyration. The murry, mullion, and the Baljudike T'were plenteous want of wisdome not to like; The faire Amelia, the Nymph Royall, and The Turks cap, the adonis, the Le'grand, The Hugonant, Appelles, and French marble, Are such whose praise, a phylomel should warble. The Oxford had attended on the crowne, But that to tell you truth hee's out of towne. Here's the gray Hulo though, and white Cornation, Would challeng more then common commendation. The Vannocker, the black imperiall And Crystall too, the mirrour of them all. Both Wiggons, low, and loftie, Angelot The Stranger, the Catewser, and what not? The Duke of venice presence here you see, And York the flower of the nobilitie. Thus gentlemen hath, Flora told her store, If you can find a wish yet ask for more. And yet (propitious soule) before you leave her, Shee vows to bring you in the Prince's favour. Had yee but met, when tulops were in towne She then had given you every one a crowne. But did I call the Lillie king of flowers? Out of all doubt then these are emperours. If those be starres then these are planets suer, If these but shine; those simples are obscure. Heres colour upon colour, you may seek A field to match the graces of one cheek: But I shall add no more, save only thus, That here Comparison is odious. Ceres, and Bacchus, promis'd to be here, And the best brewer sent us in our bere: Since thenere neither wants Beer, Wine, nor guest, Flaggons and flowers shall flow at Floras feast. Let chearly Cups crown a carowsing day; Ambrose shall broach, ye the Ambrosia. Your eyes see Flora's heaven and that your eares. May feast too, hark Apollo moves the spheares. The Song. Stay! O stay! ye winged howers, The windes that ransack East, and West, Have breathd perfumes upon our flowers, More fragrant then the Phænix nest: Then stay! O stay sweet howers! that yee, May witnesse that, which time nere see. Stay a while, thou featherd Syth-man, And attend the Queen of flowers, Show thy self for once a blyth man, Come dispence with a few howers: Else we our selves will stay a while, And make our pastime, Time beguile. This day is deignd to Floras use, If yee will revell too, to night Wee! presse the Grape, to lend ye juyce, Shall make a deluge of delight: And when yee cant hold up your heads, Our Garden shall afford ye beds. An EPITAPH. Upon Oliver O dead drunk. Here lyes a Lyon, and a Lamb, Sweet, and savage, wilde and tame: Courteous, carelesse, Poore, and proud, Man, and no man: Litle, and lowd: Childrens May game; fine, forlorne, Courtiers consort: Commons scorne: Kind, and currish, would ye know Who I mean? tis Oliver O, That companion base and boon, Sets and Rises with the Sun: Thus in brief his exercise He pipes, dances, and he dyes, And when passing we can tell; For he rings out his own knell. Upon his second time being dead drunk. Loe here, Twas ruffe, Dead as the bere, And with a puffe Was drawn last yeare: Out went the snuffe. And Coffind up, Alas! how soon In a lost Cup, Tis after noon? Lyes, litle heart O, This morning hee O, Who like a fart O, Was companie O, Did now depart O. For thee, or mee O. Tnd tooke But P? O, Ahe Spanish smoke, No more but so; Jnto his poke, Tis Oliver O As if he meant Lets oversee Sir, by consent This scape for hee To tune his pipe O, The truth to tell O But being ripe, O, Till he was mellow, Began to type O, Was a good fellow; And shall to morrow morning make's approach As quick, and lively, as the fresh abroach. An Epitaph. Dedicate to the Memorie of Dr. Ed. Cook. Unsluce your Captive flouds; what, can ye keep Your eyes from teares, and see the Marble weep? Burst out for shame, or if yee find no vent For greife, yet stay and see the stones relent; Jf still you can forbeare; weepe then to see: Your stupid hearts more stone, then Niobe. On goodwife Plaine. Here with out either welt, or gard, Lyes goody Plaine in the Church yard: Fresh in our memoryes, till the next raine, Setle the earth againe, downe plaine. On W. G. A great swearer but litle lyar VVill, the swearer's dead and gon, VVhether? you may guesse anon. Say hee is in heaven J dare not Jn that sacred place they sweare not. VVhere then? not in hell, no doubt, For heed sweare the devill out, What must then become of him, Does hee neither sinck nor swim; Heavens forbid, wel'l judge the best, And conclude his souls' at rest. Of his oathes, hee did repent him, And his conscience do'unt torment him And hee shall (heavens mercy crav'd) By Gods bloud, and wounds be sav'd In memoriam Roberti Dey Pharmacap. Norv. Arts Parramour is dead, that men may see, Nature hath no hold of eternitie. O that my teares were legible that J, And my sad muse, might weep his elegie: Norwich, in sorrows weeds attend his urne, If not for his; yet for your owne sakes mourne. Remember cittizens, yee us'd to fly To sue out your reprives from death, to Dy: Whose salutifierous magazine of artes, Was your cheife Sanctuary against death's darts. There, feeble nature in a trice might be, Arm'd against all disseases Gap ape. But hee is gone, and in a good old age, Tooke his calme Exit of a turbulent stage: His death as harmelesse as his birth, from whence His years were crownd with double innocence;) good VVhilst wee, (for so perhaps heavens have thought Are left, to write our stories in our bloud. Time's syth hath wounded him, but hee hath got Such semper-vivum, as hee feels it not. VVith faith, hope, charitie, &amp; contrition He made up his Celestiall composition. And with an unctious name hee mixt a Roll, Of Gratia dei for his wounded soule: Now his thread yeilded to the Sisters knife, For Aqua-vitæ hee drinkes water of life. Much might unto his prayses spoken be, And only this one truth; namely that hee, Even Dey, the true Apothecary was, All that are left, are but synoyma's. To the perpetuall memory of my ever honoured Cozen Mr. E. H. Vnder this sad marble lyes, Natures pride; and beauties prize: Such, so sweet her accents were, As would charme a Syrens eare; Such her modest mode as shee. Taught the turtle charitie. Jn summe a more veruous wife, Never sweetend husbands life. To conclude then, all was shee, Man could wish, or woman be, Who lyes here, like treasure found Not above but under ground. A Legacie to VRBANIA an unworthy Cittie. Citty ingrate, nay worse, but Ile include, All your good nature, in ingratitude. Wellfare your costly swordes which now yee wou'd As faine encrimson in my inocent bloud. As ere yee wisht m' Crucifige accept you; ah! you Hosanna cry, and hosenecha too: Js it in this; in this, J pray, I wrong yee To spend my selfe, and my estate among yee? Jf weary steps to make your Citty flourish, If head, if heart, if Purse employ'd to nourish Widows distrest, and orphans be a crime, Grant heaven no worse offence take up my time, Bark on black mouthed envie, yee as soone, Affright mee, as the Syrian wolves, the moone: Nor doe J envie those, have sought with cost, The honourable trouble, J: have lost: Lord fill my hart with thanks, my mouth with praise My haires may yet see halcyon dayes: God guards mee still, though I've no swordest t'davance, Though no fine cap, God is my maintenance. In Honorem Poetarum. Whose poore conceit is that That Poets should be poore? They talk they know not what, Alas! they wish no more, They have Enough in that they see Content is worth a monarchy. Do not the sacred Nine, Come daily to their houses, And break their fast, and dine, And sup, and soop carouses? Who calls them poore then, that are able, To feast the Muses at their table? Yee go to Poets, when Your dearest friends be dead, They give them life agen Though they be buried: Tis strange then, Poets should not live That thus can life to dead men give. Yea all the world must know, Save those to truth averse, The swaine was taught to plow, By Virgills fertil verse. Tis strange then, he should needy be, Found out the art of Husbandry. Riplïe was rich I trow, VVhose Poems did enfold That which men hunt for soe, The art of making Gold: He had the Phylosophick stone, Sure hee, must then be rich, or none. Yea, do not all men say? Poets dare any thing: Pray was not noble May Calld brother by a King? Nor is it more then true report, Satyrick lines have hang'd a sort. Euridice could tell That being ravisht hence, Bold Orpheus ransackt hell, And rescu'd her from thence. Yea verses so Magnetick are, They fetch the Moon down from the sphear. Nor have they only power, But gifts of prophesie, The most celestiall dower, Heavens give mortalitie. Sure then they can't want costly Cates, Being Oracles and Potentates. They that have most, still itch For more, more baggs to stuffe, VVhilst they are only rich, Can see they have enuffe; How poorly fools of Poets prate? Come, they are poore, whom God doth hate. Princeps; &amp; Vates non quovis nascitur anno. Moore Fields This afternoon I met the tribe of Gad, Running through Bedlam as they had been mad Shufling and shouldring at so strange a rate, As if they strove to enter the strait gate. VVith that seeing the conflux of the traine I could not choose but mak't Turne againe Lane, And down the stream making my armes, my Oares I row'd to Moore fields, where I found more whores Gentle, and simple, then a man could meet, Either in Turn ball, or in Turn up Street. Satting and Silk, and Peticoats brocado Marcht like an Amazonian armado, Furious as your French troops, scarce ere a wench But by her out side, shew her inside French. Some zealous Gitt'zens shew their wives, that even By being Cuckolds, they might go heaven. It made me laugh to see their sweeping trailes In spite of Barbars puffes, powder their tailes. O how the leacherous dust did vaught! and rise Twixt the crosse Chevernes of their foaming thighs. So light were they, so given to the Tup VVhat men would not, the very winds took up. VVith that said I, now too too well perceive I, Y'are not the tribe of Gad alone, But Levi. Meane while the trees in such even order grow, They seem'd a second Pater noster row. They raild in-grasse-plot as a spacious shop Of Summer weeds for Virgins was set ope. And many gallants came from out the towne Thither, to give their Ladies a green-Gowne. Here is great wrastling, Boyes, and men, and all And here and there a woman takes a fall; Venter on which you please, if men you like, Know then they sayle close by the Wind mil strike. If you from men, to women be departers, You shall not faile to meet them in the quarters. And therefore if your purpose that way stand Goe see for them, when you cant see your hand And to your work (my friend) tis Country play Not by the belt but felt, catch that catch may. Be not discourag'd for the duskie night Bee't nere so dark, Ile warrant you a light. More of Moore-fields if you desire to know, Faith I have ta'ne my turne: And so must you. Upon the Sickness, and recovery of a faire and fairely promised LADY. But hadst thou Death such hopes alive, Thy sute could ever thrive, In flatt'ring her T'her Sepulher, From her approaching bridall bed, Alas! thy hopes are dead. Dead as thy selfe Unwelcome else, But would you faine forestall, forsooth The sweets of bloomy youth? Your sute is cold And you too bold. Suffice it long time henee that thou Bath in her aged snow, Couldst thou her send To thy dark bed? Her orient Eye would shoot a ray Should make thy midnight day; As though the Sun Did thither run, And all his rutilous Jewells set In that close Cabinet. Then should mournin See joyes morning. Then palest ashes should revive And Death be made alive. VVhilst we, blind wee, If wee would see. Must all our light Cymmerian like. From flintie bosomes strike. But thanks to Heaven, Death is bereaven: Th' Eclipse is past, and beauties light Ha's banisht dead of night. See, see the love. Of heaven above. For we have here Gods blessings got And the warme Sun to boot. O let us now Low as earth bow; And gratefull sacrifices give, To him that here said, let her live. To a Gentleman desiring mee to write a Paper of Verses upon his sitting whilst the Painter was drawing his Picture. And Poet too? must you your figure see In silent, and in speaking poesie? I could admit this double task, in case You had like Janus too a double face. Say, is it your desire? whilst he does take Your superficiall lineaments; I should make Your vertues image? Is it this you mean? I must like Momus have a Casement then. Or feare you men will say you are a creature. Narcissus like in love with your own feature? And therefore have the Painter to produce. A colour: And the Poet an excuse: Come be advis'd by mee, go to your wife, Ile warrant you your Picture to the life. Here you compose your countenance, And set. Whilst't may be shee's drawing your counterfeit. Come the true way of lively life commanding Is never done by sitting, But by standing. ? Pictoribus atque Poetis Quidlibet audiendi semper fuit æqua potestas. Pers. To an impudent Scold that perpetually haunts her Husband, and not only abuseth him but whatsoever Company is with him. Woman (but may I call the so, and not Forfeit that little judgment I have got? Is't not enough y'are uglie, but beside Your ill shape you must be ill quality'd? I had suppos'n that such a one as you Whose face a winning feature never knew A woman (if that appellation may Be yet allow'd) made of the coursest clay: And of a fabrick so imperfect as't Is well concluded nature was in hast. I had suppos'd I say, that such a brute, Had cause more then enough to have been mute At least shee should if shee had silence broke. With Balams Asse but once, and wisely spoke. But you unlock the thunder of your voice, And twenty Iron Mills make not more noyse. VVhen you begin the clamour of your prate You make the rabulous rout at Billings-gate. Mute as their Fish: VVere you my wife forsooth, I should lock up the Barn-doores of your mouth. Or ferret-like, sow't up, My wife said I? Some Planet first dispatch me from the skie. Ide ransack beds of clay, and light upon The Devill in a new fallne sceleton. Or what in man, or Hells invention worse is Them think of the, Of thee thou curse of Curses. O wretch thy Husband, O infortunate. I drowne mine Eyes in sorrow for his sate. I finde in story an inchanted Lasse All day a Hagge: All night an angell was His luck poor man is worse, for meeting you Hee's haunted with a Hagge day and night too. For when abroad in this sad plight he goes Seeking some corner to unbreast his woes; You follow him hot foot, and range about Beating all bushes till you finde him out. And when hee once but in your sight appeares, You spend, And with full cry confound his eares, And ours too, who admire what you intend him VVhether to bait him, or to apprehend him. Thus like Actcon with affrights hedg'd round Hee flyes the furie of his owne feirce hound. We know your language you Tartarian whore That use to play bo-peep at Tavern dore. Peaking for pimping rascalls, and when ere Yon feare discovery, what's my Husband here: Thus you obstreperous strumpet, Thus you must Make your poore Husband cloak for your base lust. Come, come, the proverb yet did never faile. They that are quick of tongue, are quick of taile. And I too plainly see, (though I am loth To be too publick) you are quick of both. Ile blast you with contempt if ere you come To ask for Husband henceforth in my roome. And teare your tongue from roofe and roots if ere I heare againe, What is my Husband here. And to the Company speak a word unmeet Wee'l kick you through the Gantlet of our feet. FINIS.</field>
