Compiled in Metre by I. H. VVhen they aske counsell at their Gods, at their Prophets, at their Southsayers and VVitches, then vvill I bring their counselles to nought. ESAY. 19. Fr? out the Rain into y? bull, as Titan last gan craule: By order in his endles path, ecliptike that men caule. Which path doth so the zodiak, iust in the mydest deuide: That syxe degrees therof are found, from it on euery syde. When day was fled, and night in place, as was natures request: I went to bed full hoping there, to take some quiet rest. Which longe before I lacked so, through trouble of mine hart: That thus I made my plaint to god, who only knewe my smart. Almighty Ioue, graunt now that I, with sleape this nyght begyle: As did Vlysses, when from care, he eased was a while. When most frendly Alcinous, good kyng of Phæacea Hym sent in ship tyll he sayld home to hys own Ithaca. Who sleaping styll was from the shippe layd forth vpon the land: Which wh? he woke, what place it was did nothing vnderstond. Untyll Minerua him informd, and gaue hym perfect vewe: How sone he might in precense be, of Penelope true Hys wyfe most chast which fortun str?g, to hys great greife of mynde: By dyuers lucke, long tyme with held, in Homer as we fynde. But Philomela bysely, recorded so hyr song: That al my shiftes could win no sleape, that would continue long, For as they fayne the thorne so sharpe dyd seme to touch hyr breast, For her shrill notes so perst mine eares, that long I could not rest. Yet in short sleaps such dredful dreames I gan to thynke and met: That when I wakt besyde my wytte it had me almost set. Me thought I dyd in medowes walke For my sport and solase: Where siluer drops, of dewe most swete dyd cleaue to euery grasse. Wherby there ran a ryuer fayre with streames so Cristall clere: That at the bothom might be sene The peeble stones appere. Aboue the medow was a rock, and on that rocke a woode: From which ran many pleasant springs into that ryuer good. Crossing the medes, they tricled downe, as lyfe bloode in the vaines Doth from the hart, till ech member, comfort therby attaynes. Aboue this woddy rocke there was a felde most pleasant grene: Where the beautye of natures workes right aptly might be sene. Ther was no herbe, nor pleas?t flower in such a felde to knowe: But might be sene most fruitfully within this feilde to grow. What should I name the Hiasinthe, or soote Uerbasculy: The clouer swete of diuers kindes, that caulde are trifoly. The Brunell, and the Bugle blewe, with fayre Hieracium: The Synkefelde, and the Betony, and swete Origanum. The Tutsain, and Hipericon, Asciron, and Paunsye: The Uyolet, and Simphiton, and the doble Dayesye. The Hartsease, and the Pacience, and crimsen Pimpernell: The Cammock, and the Cammomille, and caunterbury bell. Rosecampany, Maudlen, and Coste, and London touft so red: Agrimony, and Lians toth, that children caule pisbed. Odoriferus Serpillum, and ladye Trases fyne: With yarow, torn twise, Strawberies. and Burnet good with wine. The Lunary, the Serpents tongue, and Procerpinaca: The Adder gras, the Saxifrage, and eke Veronica. It hedged was with honysuckes, or Periclimenum: Well myxed with smale Cornus trease, swete bryer, and Ligustrum. The white thorn, &amp; y? black thorne both, with boxe, and maple fyne: In which braunched the briony, the Iuye, and wylde vyne. To long I should the tyme detract, and from my purpose straie: If I should recken all the things within the felde so gaye. Besyde the good prospect for those, that know astronomy: I thinke no platform in the world, where one might more aptly The rysyng see, and settyngs both, that Cosmike haue to name: Cronike to, and Helyak, of starres of noble fame. About our arctik pole ye myght the lytle beare fyrst see: That cauled are, the quardes, of those, that conning saylers be. The great beare also in the which charles wayne apereth stoute: Which with the small beare euer more, doth walk the pole about. Which bears the dragon doth inuolue, then Bootes, and the north crowne: And after kneelyng Hercules, is sene with great renowne. Harpe, falling gryp, goate, swan, and he that vse to dryue the cart: The man that doth the serpent beare, the eagle, and the dart. Dolphin, forehors, and thother hors that flyes cauld Pegasus: The triangle, and Andromede as some men do discusse. The Zodiake, with his xii. sygnes, where planets haue their way: With all aspects that may bechance to any night or daye. The Bulls eye, with the rest of starres, that caulde are Hyades May there be sene, with y? brood H?ne, that some name Plœiades. The Manger, and the Asses twayne, the Lions hart, and tayle: The virgins spike, the scorpions hart, and water potte all hayle. Whale, orion, and golden yarde, that ladyes Elle some calle: The riuer, hare, and both the dogges, as well the great as small. The serpent of the south, the Cuppe, the Rauen, and Centawre: The Centawrs speare: &amp; then the wolfe, and also the altare. The south crowne also may be sene, with many other there: As tricars constellacion, or Berenices heare, The shippe that Argo poetes do name, there might a man beholde: And many mo then I can name, an hundred thousand folde. There might ye see ascensions, both oblique and ryght: No secretes of astronomye, that were not there in syght. And to be briefe, it was the ioye, of Ladye Vranie: Wherin to walke she did frequent, with all hyr familye. But as I clymed vp the rocke, as I had oft before: Of that swete felde to take the ayre, Which doth mans spirits restore, I mette a man in garments long most decent to behold: His long beard gray, so was his hedde, which did declare hym old. His countenance in sobernes all others dyd excell: His gate and gesture semd enough all vices to expell. For from the rule of honesty in hym was nothing sene: His outward workes did explicate an inward conscience cleane. He toke me by the hand, and sayd, dere frend how far away? To yender feld father (I sayd) a whyle meself to play. My frend alas (quod he) beware how ye hence forth come there: It wyll you ells in hell confound, therfore I say forbeare. What is your name my father say, (sayd I) do it disclose: Theologus, I am (quod he) with the I wyll not glose. Why than (sayd I) do ye me warne from yender pleasant place? Because (quod he) it late receaud a chaunce of great disgrace. How so (sayd I) than hark quod he, I do not vse to lye: I wyll the shew how it befell, and that ryght orderly. A heron foule, that hunger gutte, of all foules at hys foode: Most rauonous, insaciate, and of most gready moode Hard by the dolfull banks of Styx, that foule infernall flood To fyll hys gutte, or take his pray styll watching late he stode. Where at the last, a serpent yonge, of Plutos hatfull kynd Came crauling out, whych gredy gutt, coulde very quickly fynde. And thynking it had ben an Ele, he cobde him vp at onse: And with that pray away he flewe, and made thereof no Bones. Which creping in his belye, dyd to him such extreme payne: Till in this field at last he light, thinking there to remaine: And forth with at his fundament, put forth his forsaid meate: Thinking as he was wont with Eles, the same againe to eate. But beyng quicke the serpent straight, did crepe among the grasse: Which long necke could no more espye, ne yet fynde where she was. Wherfore to Styx he went againe, and like wyse swalowed moe: And to this fielde still toke his flight, and there did let them go. Tyll he at last so many brought, through this his frequent vse: That now this fyeld is marred quyte, through most hatfull abuse. And such a number of serpents in it do dayly breed: Which on these herbes &amp; pleasant gras, continually do fede, That now it is not only robde of euery pleasant flower, But hatefull stinche may there be felt at euery time and hower. And Vranie hath it forsoke, with holsome plaesant showers: And naturall Astronomye, with al her fauourers. And true phisyke forsakes it to, for why, cloudes infernall Are dayly blowen from Lethes floud to water it withall. Which causeth nothing there to grow, but superstition, Of learnyng pure, and science good the vyle obliuion. Astrologye iudiciall therfore doth it possesse: Which is a strompet counterfyte, and yet neuertheles Because some learned men to hyr do cast their myndes and loue: That she is true astronomy ryght many she doth moue. And vnder colour of that name they vse Necromancye: With hatfull incantacions, and vyle Geomancye. Of Magike artes there are great store, and Augurs arte perdye: Foredeming as Aruspices, and some as Pyrethi. All Witchcraft vyle and Sorcerye, of false Phytonicus, Although they giue th?selues the name of graue Philonicus. These are the frutes of Phlegiæ, or Satanes wicked broode, That in this fielde the Heron shitte, to ease him when he stode. Alas: (quod I) hath this vncleane, and hatefull byrde done so: And natures derling thus defast? to hym ve ve, wo wo. Then am I of my fantasye, and my pleasant delight: And holsome recreation robde, and depryued quight. With hanging hed, and bashfull face I turned backe againe. For grayberds counsell durst I not refuse, or once disdayne But with most lowly reuerence with thanke and condyng praise I serued him, when as we went ech one hys sondry wayes. But sorowfully syghing I went with my sory newes, Enforming my familyar frendes with whom I dyd peruse My study small, where with I do my wytte still occupy: And do with them communicate my mynde continually. Of which some did sorowfully with me thys chaunce lament. And other some would not beleue, but to the place they went. Nor would nor here Theologus, that frendly dyd them warne: But nedes would go presumpteusly, the matter to deserne. Which hath them so infected now, and that most dyuelishely: They are content to graunt it still to be Astronomye. And necessary wyll it call, though by the diules worke Under cloke of Astronomye these foule false faytors loorke, So I be holpe of greife (say they) or fynd that which I loste: Or know my desteny to come, why should I count it coste? God would not suffer (other sayd) such thynges for to be wrought: If he dyd not alowe the same, or know it to be nought. It is a good worke, (other sayde), men to health to restore: Although it be by deuills worke, what nede I pas therefore. To helpe a true man to his goods, whereof he was depriued By false theues and vile barators, that wrongly it atchiued. It can not be but a good worke, thus beastly men and fond Do answere them, that wold enstruct, or make them vnderstand. Not regarding the law of god, nor hys commaundement: That no yll thing ought to be done, vpon a good intent. Also if gods permission were a lawfull defence, So were it for all kinde of synne, and most wicked offence. As whoredome, homicide, and thefte, with vyle idolatrye: For treason, couetyse, and pryde, and most vyle simonye. May I not say, all these be good, syth god doth them permitte: As well as those whom ye defend, Oh men of beastly witte? His sufferance is to let your synne in to full rypenes growe: That in the lake of sulphure he most iustly may you throwe. And so declare his glory great vnto his flocke electe: That do by grace these wicked arts, cleane from their hartes reiect. Their counsells all at god they aske, and do at him requyre Their sauyng helth, and he doth gyue to them their whole desire. For why one heare shall neuer fall, from of their heads no tyme Without his wyll, which doth impute to them no synne nor cryme. For why they aske in lyuely faith all whereof they haue nede: Which causeth them assuredly of their purpose to spede. Therfore it must of force proceade, of infydelitye: That ye at deuils seke such help through most vyle sorcery. As did kyng Saule that damned man, when gods spirit him forsoke, When god would hym no answere make for wytchcraft gan he loke, Whych faitheles shyft, how mich it did hym in hys nede auayle Dyd well appere, he slewe himself, when foose did him assayle. And so do ye your selues declare, of that same very sect: While ye at Satan seke your helpe, and do gods power suspect. For as to dyules here ye sought, as reprobates forelorne: So shall ye be hys porcion, syth god ye haue forsworne. Unles in tyme ye may repent, which if it be gods will: He graunt ye all that ye may hate, and shornish this great yll. For though on prudent Salomon they father this there art: They are the workes of wickednes, and of eternall smart. The very cause, for why sainct Iohn, as god did him reueale: Hath found their place to be in hell, where torments are eche deale. Confounded are these coniurers with conscience vncleane: And all that vnto sorcery, or wicked wichcrafte leane. For in theyr art they do no dout, the lyuing god forsake: Cleauing to condemnation, and therof hold do take. What nede I here recyte scripture, syth all men well do knowe: That god so deadly doth it hate, that neyther hygh nor lowe The same may vse, but that it will to Satan hys soule gyue: Or if gods law obserued were, not one of them should lyue That charmers are, or coniurers, wyth wyches sorcerye: Or such as chosers are of dayes, marking the byrdes that flye. For why the faithfull that do feare god ryghtly and beleue Assuredly, do know that no such thing can once them greue. And as for that astrologye, Iudiciall that ye name: Let learned Caluyne satisfye, all wise men of the same. But Phisyke, and astronomy, alas is now the cloke For euery kynd of trechery, that goodnes doth reuoke. For wycked, wandering fugitiues: or vacaboundes most leaud: Do now a daies from shere, to shere, with shyftes both false and shrewed Under colour of phisykes art, and noble surgery Delude the common multitude, wyth shamefull sorcery. All secreat markes they will disclose, and thinges long done and paste: Which doth with admiration the people make agaste In such wise, that they straight beleue that nothing vnder sonne Doth stand to hard or difficult of such men to be donne. So that partly with Palmistry, or Chiromancies gawde: And folishe Phisiognomy, and wichery that fraud Unto their wicked, false purpose the people they allure: More then can any godly art, that perfect is and pure. For bedlem baudes, &amp; hatefull whores this is a common shyft: Of roffins theues and murderers it also is the drift. Under such clok their companies togither oft they draw: Free from daunger of officers, and punishment of lawe. Alas that this might be sen to with iustice, power, and might. That Vranie, and Medicine againe might haue their right. That now is by extorcion so frawdulently kept: That for most true possessioners the most part them accept. For how their field was put them fro before I haue you sayd: Desyring now all learned men in this to adde their ayde. That from the filthy fruites of hell It may once be purged: That there the right inheritours, Againe might be lodged. That now be fayne to seke els where. some holsome place to dwell: Where of the wyse they are accept, and entertayned well. Amonge these thoughts most troublesome, at last I dyd awake: Findyng my body sweating sore, and all my synewes shake. Where I long tyme lay sighing sore, thinking of thys straunge dreame: Wyshyng for som interpretour, yf any in thys realme Were full expert therin, as was Ferdinand Ponzetus: Or Artemidor, whose syr name, is sayd Daldianus. But as ech thing doth weare by time, so other thoughts at last Abated thys perplexity, and it began to wast. And I againe came to my self, that I dyd shortly here: The warbling notes &amp; songe so swete, of Philomela cleare. Whych counsaylld me that slothfulnes I should from me expell: Wherfore I rose, and with all spede I lyghted a candell. So serued my turne my tinder box, whych stood in my chamber: Then toke I forth my standish to, with pen, ynke, and paper Where I carued forth ilfauoredly, this rough and ragged verse: Wherin theffect of thys my dreame, I rudely do rehears. Dsiering yet my reades dere, to beare it paciently: Syth it is but the budding flower, of my poore infancy. Which as ripnes of knowledge growes, I shall be glad tamend: If any man, shall me informe, and thus I make an end, FINIS. Ye shall not learne after the maner of the heathen, and ye shall not feare the tokens of heauen, for the heathen are afrayed of suche, yea all the customes and lavves of the Gentiles are nothing but vanitye. IEREME. 10. Go novv to thy coniurers, and to the multitude of thy vvyches, vvhom thou hast bene aquaynted vvith all from thy youthe, yf they maye here the or strengthen the. Thou hast hetherto had many counsels of them. So let the heauen gasers and beholders of Starres , come on novve and delyuer the: yea and let them shevve, vvhen these nevv thinges shall come vppon the. Beholde they shall be lyke stravve , vvhyche yf it be kyndled vvyth fyre, no man maye ryd it for the vehemencye of the flame. And yet it giueth no sinders to vvarme a man by, nor cleare fyre to sytte by. Euen so shall they be vvhome from thy youthe thou haste frequented. Euery one shall shevve the hys erroneus vvay, yet shall none of them defende the. ESAYE. 47.</field>
