      <field name="fulltext">WHIMS AND ODDITIES. First Series âO Cicero! Cicero! if to pun be a crime, 'tis a crime I have learned of thee: O Bias! Bias! if to pun be a crime, by thy example I was biassed.â âScriblerus. DEDICATION TO THE REVIEWERS What is a modern Poet's fate? To write his thoughts upon a slate;â The Critic spits on what is done,â Gives it a wipe,âand all is gone. MORAL REFLECTIONS ON THE CROSS OF ST. PAUL'S 1 The man that pays his pence, and goes Up to thy lofty cross, St. Paul, Looks over London's naked nose, Women and men: The world is all beneath his ken, He sits above the Ball. He seems on Mount Olympus' top, Among the Gods, by Jupiter! and lets drop His eyes from the empyreal clouds On mortal crowds. 2 Seen from these skies, How small those emmets in our eyes! Some carry little sticksâand one His eggsâto warm them in the sun: Dear! what a hustle, And bustle! And there's my aunt. I know her by her waist, So long and thin, And so pinch'd in, Just in the pismire taste. 3 Oh! what are men?âBeings so small, That, should I fall Upon their little heads, I must Crush them by hundreds into dust! 4 And what is life? and all its agesâ There's seven stages! Turnham Green! Chelsea! Putney! Fulham! Brentford! and Kew! And Tooting, too! And oh! what very little nags to pull 'em. Yet each would seem a horse indeed, If here at Paul's tip-top we'd got 'em; Although, like Cinderella's breed, They're mice at bottom. Then let me not despise a horse, Though he looks small from Paul's high cross! Since he would be,âas near the sky, âFourteen hands high. 5 What is this world with London in its lap? Mogg's Map. The Thames, that ebbs and flows in its broad channel? A tidy kennel. The bridges stretching from its banks? Stone planks. Oh me! hence could I read an admonition To mad Ambition! But that he would not listen to my call, Though I should stand upon the cross, and ball! A VALENTINE 1 Oh! cruel heart! ere these posthumous papers Have met thine eyes, I shall be out of breath; Those cruel eyes, like two funereal tapers, Have only lighted me the way to death. Perchance, thou wilt extinguish them in vapours, When I am gone, and green grass covereth Thy lover, lost; but it will be in vainâ It will not bring the vital spark again. 2 Ah! when those eyes, like tapers, burned so blue, It seemed an omen that we must expect The sprites of lovers; and it boded true, For I am half a spriteâa ghost elect; Wherefore I write to thee this last adieu, With my last penâbefore that I effect My exit from the stage; just stopp'd before The tombstone steps that lead us to death's door. 3 Full soon these living eyes, now liquid bright, Will turn dead dull, and wear no radiance, save They shed a dreary and inhuman light, Illumed within by glow-worms of the grave; These ruddy cheeks, so pleasant to the sight, These lusty legs, and all the limbs I have, Will keep Death's carnival, and, foul or fresh, Must bid farewell, a long farewell, to flesh! 4 Yea, and this very heart, that dies for thee, As broken victuals to the worms will go; And all the world will dine again but meâ For I shall have no stomach;âand I know, When I am ghostly, thou wilt sprightly be As now thou art: but will not tears of woe Water thy spirits, with remorse adjunct, When thou dost pause, and think of the defunct? 5 And when thy soul is buried in a sleep, In midnight solitude, and little dreaming Of such a spectreâwhat, if I should creep Within thy presence in such dismal seeming? Thine eyes will stare themselves awake, and weep, And thou wilt cross thyself with treble screaming, And pray with mingled penitence and dread That I were less aliveâor not so dead. 6 Then will thy heart confess thee, and reprove This wilful homicide which thou hast done: And the sad epitaph of so much love Will eat into thy heart, as if in stone: And all the lovers that around thee move, Will read my fate, and tremble for their own; And strike upon their heartless breasts, and sigh, âMan, born of woman, must of woman die!â 7 Mine eyes grow dropsicalâI can no moreâ And what is written thou may'st scorn to read, Shutting thy tearless eyes.â'Tis doneâ'tis o'erâ My hand is destin'd for another deed. But one last word wrung from its aching core, And my lone heart in silentness will bleed; Alas! it ought to take a life to tell That one last wordâthat fareâfareâfare thee well! BACKING THE FAVOURITE! Oh a pistol, or a knife! For I'm weary of my life,â My cup has nothing sweet left to flavour it; My estate is out at nurse, And my heart is like my purse,â And all through backing of the Favourite! At dear O'Neil's first start, I sported all my heart,â Oh, Becher, he never marr'd a braver hit! For he cross'd her in her race, And made her lose her place, And there was an end of that Favourite! Anon, to mend my chance, For the Goddess of the Dance The late favourite of the King's Theatre, who left the pas seul of life for a perpetual Ball. Is not that her effigy now commonly borne about by the Italian image vendorsâan ethereal form holding a wreath with both hands above her headâand her husband, in emblem, beneath her foot? I pin'd, and told my enslaver it!â But she wedded in a canter, And made me a Levanter, In foreign lands to sigh for the Favourite! Then next Miss M. A. Tree I adored, so sweetly she Could warble like a nightingale and quaver it;â But she left that course of life To be Mr. Bradshaw's wife, And all the world lost on the Favourite! But out of sorrow's surf Soon I leap'd upon the turf, Where fortune loves to wanton it and waver it;â But standing on the pet, âO my bonny, bonny Bet!â Black and yellow pull'd short up with the Favourite! Thus flung by all the crack, I resolv'd to cut the pack,â The second-raters seemed then a safer hit! So I laid my little odds Against Memnon! Oh, ye Gods! Am I always to be floored by the Favourite! THE MERMAID OF MARGATE âAlas! what perils do environ That man who meddles with a siren!â âHudibras. On Margate beach, where the sick one roams, And the sentimental reads; Where the maiden flirts, and the widow comesâ Like the oceanâto cast her weeds,â Where urchins wander to pick up shells, And the Cit to spy at the ships,â Like the water gala at Sadler's Wells,â And the Chandler for watery dips;â There's a maiden sits by the ocean brim, As lovely and fair as sin! But woe, deep water and woe to him, That she snareth like Peter Fin! Her head is crown'd with pretty sea-wares, And her locks are golden and loose: And seek to her feet, like other folks' heirs, To stand, of course, in her shoes! And, all day long, she combeth them well, With a sea-shark's prickly jaw; And her mouth is just like a rose-lipp'd shell, The fairest that man e'er saw! And the Fishmonger, humble as love may be, Hath planted his seat by her side; âGood even, fair maid! Is thy lover at sea, To make thee so watch the tide?â She turn'd about with her pearly brows, And clasp'd him by the hand:â âCome, love, with me; I've a bonny house On the golden Goodwin Sand.â And then she gave him a siren kiss, No honeycomb e'er was sweeter; Poor wretch! how little he dreamt for this That Peter should be salt-Peter: And away with her prize to the wave she leapt, Not walking, as damsels do, With toe and heel, as she ought to have stept, But she hopt like a Kangaroo; One plunge, and then the victim was blind, Whilst they galloped across the tide; At last, on the bank he waked in his mind, And the Beauty was by his side. One half on the sand, and half in the sea, But his hair began to stiffen; For when he look'd where her feet should be, She had no more feet than Miss Biffen! But a scaly tail, of a dolphin's growth, In the dabbling brine did soak: At last she open'd her pearly mouth, Like an oyster, and thus she spoke:â âYou crimpt my father, who was a skate;â And my sister you soldâa maid; So here remain for a fish'ry fate, For lost you are, and betray'd!â And away she went, with a seagull's scream, And a splash of her saucy tail; In a moment he lost the silvery gleam That shone on her splendid mail! The sun went down with a blood-red flame, And the sky grew cloudy and black, And the tumbling billows like leap-frog came, Each over the other's back! Ah, me! it had been a beautiful scene, With a safe terra-firma round; But the green water-hillocks all seem'd to him Like those in a church-yard ground; And Christians love in the turf to lie, Not in watery graves to be; Nay, the very fishes will sooner die On the land than in the sea. And whilst he stood, the watery strife Encroached on every hand, And the ground decreas'dâhis moments of life Seem'd measur'd, like Time's, by sand; And still the waters foam'd in, like ale, In front, and on either flank, He knew that Goodwin and Co. must fail, There was such a run on the bank. A little more, and a little more, The surges came tumbling in; He sang the evening hymn twice o'er, And thought of every sin! Each flounder and plaice lay cold at his heart, As cold as his marble slab; And he thought he felt, in every part, The pincers of scalded crab! The squealing lobsters that he had boil'd, And the little potted shrimps, All the horny prawns he had ever spoil'd, Gnawed into his soul, like imps! And the billows were wandering to and fro, And the glorious sun was sunk, And Day, getting black in the face, as though Of the night-shade she had drunk! Had there been but a smuggler's cargo adrift, One tub, or keg, to be seen, It might have given his spirits a lift Or an anker where Hope might lean! But there was not a box or a beam afloat, To raft him from that sad place; Not a skiff, not a yawl, or a mackarel boat, Nor a smack upon Neptune's face. At last, his lingering hopes to buoy, He saw a sail and a mast, And called âAhoy!ââbut it was not a hoy, And so the vessel went past. And with saucy wing that flapp'd in his face, The wild bird about him flew, With a shrilly scream, that twitted his case, âWhy, thou art a sea-gull too!â And lo! the tide was over his feet; Oh! his heart began to freeze, And slowly to pulse:âin another beat The wave was up to his knees! He was deafen'd amidst the mountain-tops, And the salt spray blinded his eyes, And wash'd away the other salt-drops That grief had caused to arise:â But just as his body was all afloat, And the surges above him broke, He was saved from the hungry deep by a boat, Of Dealâ(but builded of oak.) The skipper gave him a dram, as he lay, And chafed his shivering skin; And the Angel return'd that was flying away With the spirit of Peter Fin! âAS IT FELL UPON A DAYâ Oh! what's befallen Bessy Brown, She stands so squalling in the street; She's let her pitcher tumble down, And all the water's at her feet! The little school-boys stood about, And laugh'd to see her pumping, pumping; Now with a curtsey to the spout, And then upon her tiptoes jumping. Long time she waited for her neighbours, To have their turns:âbut she must lose The watery wages of her labours,â Except a little in her shoes! Without a voice to tell her tale, And ugly transport in her face; All like a jugless nightingale, She thinks of her bereaved case. At last she sobsâshe criesâshe screams!â And pours her flood of sorrows out, From eyes and mouth, in mingled streams, Just like the lion on the spout. For well poor Bessy knows her mother Must lose her tea, for water's lack, That Sukey burnsâand baby-brother Must be dry-rubb'd with huck-a-back! THE FALL OF THE DEER [From an old MS.] Now the loud Crye is up, and harke! The barkye Trees give back the Bark; The House Wife heares the merrie rout, And runnes,âand lets the beere run out, Leaving her Babes to weepe,âfor why? She likes to heare the Deer Dogges crye, And see the wild Stag how he stretches The naturall Buck-skin of his Breeches, Running like one of Human kind Dogged by fleet Bailiffes close behindâ As if he had not payde his Bill For Ven'son, or was owing still For his two Hornes, and soe did get Over his Head and Ears in Debt;â Wherefore he strives to paye his Waye With his long Legges the while he maye:â But he is chased, like Silver Dish, As well as anye Hart may wish Except that one whose Heart doth beat So faste it hasteneth his Feet;â And runninge soe he holdeth Death Four Feet from him,âtill his Breath Faileth, and slacking Pace at last, From runninge slow he standeth faste, With hornie Bayonettes at baye To baying Dogges around, and they Pushing him sore, he pusheth sore, And goreth them that seek his Gore,â Whatever Dogge his Horne doth rive Is deadâas sure as he's alive! Soe that courageous Hart doth fight With Fate, and calleth up his might, And standeth stout that he maye fall Bravelye, and be avenged of all, Nor like a Craven yeeld his Breath Under the Jawes of Dogges and Death! DECEMBER AND MAY âCrabbed Age and Youth cannot live together.â âShakspeare. Said Nestor, to his pretty wife, quite sorrowful one day, âWhy, dearest, will you shed in pearls those lovely eyes away? You ought to be more fortified;â âAh, brute, be quiet, do, I know I'm not so fortyfied, nor fiftyfied, as you! âOh, men are vile deceivers all, as I have ever heard, You'd die for me you swore, and IâI took you at your word. I was a tradesman's widow thenâa pretty change I've made; To live, and die the wife of one, a widower by trade!â âCome, come, my dear, these flighty airs declare, in sober truth, You want as much in age, indeed, as I can want in youth; Besides, you said you liked old men, though now at me you huff.â âWhy, yes,â she said, âand so I doâbut you're not old enough!â âCome, come, my dear, let's make it up, and have a quiet hive; I'll be the best of men,âI mean, I'll be the best alive! Your grieving so will kill me, for it cuts me to the core.ââ âI thank ye, sir, for telling meâfor now I'll grieve the more!â A WINTER NOSEGAY O, wither'd winter Blossoms, Dowager-flowers,âthe December vanity. In antiquated visages and bosoms,â What are ye plann'd for, Unless to stand for Emblems, and peevish morals of humanity? There is my Quaker Aunt, A Paper-Flower,âwith a formal border No breeze could e'er disorder, Pouting at that old beauâthe Winter Cherry, A pucker'd berry; And Box, like a tough-liv'd annuitant,â Verdant alwayâ From quarter-day even to quarter-day; And poor old Honesty, as thin as want, Well namedâGod-wot; Under the baptism of the water-pot, The very apparition of a plant; And why, Dost hold thy head so high, Old Winter-Daisy;â Because thy virtue never was infirm, Howe'er thy stalk be crazy? That never wanton fly, or blighting worm, Made holes in thy most perfect indentation? 'Tis likely that sour leaf, To garden thief, Forcepp'd or wing'd, was never a temptation;â Well,âstill uphold thy wintry-reputation; Still shalt thou frown upon all lovers' trial: And when, like Grecian maids, young maids of ours Converse with flow'rs, Then thou shalt be the token of denial. Away! dull weeds, Born without beneficial use or needs! Fit only to deck out cold winding-sheets; And then not for the milkmaid's funeral-bloom, Or fair Fidele's tombâ To tantalize,âvile cheats! Some prodigal bee, with hope of after-sweets, Frigid and rigid, As if ye never knew One drop of dew, Or the warm sun resplendent; Indifferent of culture and of care, Giving no sweets back to the fostering air, Churlishly independentâ I hate ye, of all breeds; Yea, all that live so selfishlyâto self, And not by interchange of kindly deedsâ Hence!âfrom my shelf! EQUESTRIAN COURTSHIP It was a young maiden went forth to ride, And there was a wooer to pace by her side; His horse was so little, and hers so high, He thought his Angel was up in the sky. His love was great, tho' his wit was small; He bade her ride easyâand that was all. The very horses began to neigh,â Because their betters had nought to say. They rode by elm, and they rode by oak, They rode by a church-yard, and then he spoke:â âMy pretty maiden, if you'll agree, You shall always amble through life with me.â The damsel answer'd him never a word, But kick'd the grey mare, and away she spurr'd. The wooer still follow'd behind the jade, And enjoy'dâlike a wooerâthe dust she made. They rode thro' moss, and they rode thro' more,â The gallant behind and the lass before:â At last they came to a miry place, And there the sad wooer gave up the chase. Quoth he, âIf my nag was better to ride, I'd follow her over the world so wide. Oh, it is not my love that begins to fail, But I've lost the last glimpse of the grey mare's tail!â SHE IS FAR FROM THE LAND Cables entangling her, Shipspars for mangling her, Ropes, sure of strangling her; Blocks over-dangling her; Tiller to batter her, Topmast to shatter her, Tobacco to spatter her; Boreas blustering, Boatswain quite flustering, Thunder-clouds mustering To blast her with sulphurâ If the deep don't engulph her; Sometimes fear's scrutiny Pries out a mutiny, Sniffs conflagration, Or hints at starvation:â All the sea-dangers, Buccaneers, rangers, Pirates and Sallee-men, Algerine galleymen, Tornadoes and typhons, And horrible syphons, And submarine travels Thro' roaring sea-navels. Everything wrong enough, Long-boat not long enough, Vessel not strong enough; Pitch marring frippery, The deck very slippery, And the cabinâbuilt sloping, The Captain a-toping, And the Mate a blasphemer, That names his Redeemer,â With inward uneasiness; The cook known, by greasiness, The victuals beslubber'd, Her bedâin a cupboard; Things of strange christening, Snatch'd in her listening, Blue lights and red lights And mention of dead-lights, And shrouds made a theme of, Things horrid to dream of,â And buoys in the water To fear all exhort her; Her friend no Leander, Herself no sea-gander, And ne'er a cork jacket On board of the packet; The breeze still a stiffening, The trumpet quite deafening; Thoughts of repentance, And doomsday and sentence; Everything sinister, Not a church minister,â Pilot a blunderer, Coral reefs under her, Ready to sunder her; Trunks tipsy-topsy, The ship in a dropsy; Waves oversurging her, Sirens a-dirgeing her; Sharks all expecting her, Sword-fish dissecting her, Crabs with their hand-vices Punishing land vices; Sea-dogs and unicorns, Things with no puny horns, Mermen carnivorousâ âGood Lord deliver us!â REMONSTRATORY ODE FROM THE ELEPHANT AT EXETER CHANGE, TO MR. MATHEWS AT THE ENGLISH OPERA-HOUSE (WRITTEN BY A FRIEND) ââSee with what courteous action, He beckons you to a more removed ground.â âHamlet. 1 Oh, Mr. Mathews! Sir! (If a plain elephant may speak his mind, And that I have a mind to speak I find By my inward stir) I long have thought, and wish'd to say, that we Mar our well-merited prosperity By being such near neighbours, My keeper now hath lent me pen and ink, Shov'd in my truss of lunch, and tub of drink, And left me to my labours. The whole menagerie is in repose, The Coatamundi is in his Sunday clothes, Watching the Lynx's most unnatural doze; The Panther is asleep, and the Macaw; The Lion is engaged on something raw; The white bear cools his chin 'Gainst the wet tin; And the confined old Monkey's in the straw. All the nine little Lionets are lying Slumbering in milk, and sighing; Miss Cross is sipping ox-tail soup In her front coop, So here's the happy mid-day moment;âyes, I seize it, Mr. Mathews, to address A word or two To you On the subject of the ruin which must come By both being in the Strand, and both at home On the same nights; two treats So very near each other, As, oh my brother! To play old gooseberry with both receipts. 2 When you begin Your summer fun, three times a week, at eight, And carriages roll up, and cits roll in, I feel a change in Exeter 'Change's change. And, dash my trunk! I hate To ring my bell when you ring yours, and go With a diminish'd glory through my show! It is most strange; But crowds that meant to see me eat a stack, And sip a water-butt or so, and crack A root of mangel-wurtzel with my foot, Eat little children's fruit, Pick from the floor small coins, And then turn slowly round and show my India-rubber loins: 'Tis strangeâmost strange, but true, That these same crowds seek you! Pass my abode and pay at your next door! It makes me roar With anguish when I think of this; I go With sad severity my nightly rounds Before one poor front row, My fatal funny foe! And when I stoop, as duty bids, I sigh And feel that, while poor elephantine I Pick up a sixpence, you pick up the pounds! 3 Could you not go? Could you not take the Cobourg or the Surrey? Or Sadler's Wellsâ(I am not in a hurry, I never am!) for the next season?âoh! Woe! woe! woe! To both of us, if we remain; for not In silence will I bear my altered lot, To have you merry, sir, at my expense: No man of any sense, No true great person (and we both are great In our own ways) would tempt another's fate. I would myself depart In Mr. Cross's cart; But, like Othello, âam not easily moved,â There's a nice house in Tottenham Court, they say, Fit for a single gentleman's small play; And more conveniently near your home; You'll easily go and come. Or get a room in the Cityâin some streetâ Coachmakers' Hall, or the Paul's Head, Cateaton Street; Any large place, in short, in which to get your bread; But do not stay, and get Me into the Gazette! 4 Ah! The Gazette! I press my forehead with my trunk, and wet My tender cheek with elephantine tears, Shed of a walnut size From my wise eyes, To think of ruin after prosperous years. What a dread case would be For meâlarge me! To meet at Basinghall Street, the first and seventh And the eleventh! To under (D?n!) My last examination! To cringe, and to surrender, Like a criminal offender, All my effectsâmy bell-pull, and my bell, My bolt, my stock of hay, my new deal cell, To post my ivory, Sir! And have some curious commissioner Very irreverently search my trunk! 'Sdeath! I should die With rage, to find a tiger in possession Of my abode; up to his yellow knees In my old straw; and my profound profession Entrusted to two beasts of assignees! 5 The truth is simply this,âif you will stay Under my very nose, Filling your rows Just at my feeding time, to see your play, My mind's made up, No more at nine I sup, Except on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Sundays, From eight to eleven, As I hope for heaven. On Thursdays, and on Saturdays, and Mondays, I'll squeak and roar, and grunt without cessation, And utterly confound your recitation. And, mark me! all my friends of the furry snout Shall join a chorus shout: We will be heardâwe'll spoil Your wicked witty ruination toil. Insolvency must ensue To you, sir, you; Unless you move your opposition shop, And let me stop. 6 I have no more to say:âI do not write In anger, but in sorrow; I must look However to my interests every night, And they detest your âMemorandum-book.â If we could join our forcesâI should like it; You do the dialogue, and I the songs. A voice to me belongs; (The Editors of the Globe and Traveller ring With praises of it, when I hourly sing God save the King.) If such a bargain could be schemed I'd strike it! I think, too, I could do the Welch old man In the Youthful Days, if dress'd upon your plan; And the attorney in your Paris trip, I'm large about the hip! Now think of this!âfor we can not go on As next door rivals, that my mind declares: I must be pennyless, or you be gone! We must live separate, or else have shares. I am a friend or foe As you take this; Let me your profitable hubbub miss Or be it âMathews, Elephant, and Co.!â THE SEA-SPELL âCauld, cauld, he lies beneath the deep.â âOld Scotch Ballad. 1 It was a jolly mariner! The tallest man of three,â He loosed his sail against the wind, And turned his boat to sea: The ink-black sky told every eye A storm was soon to be! 2 But still that jolly mariner Took in no reef at all, For, in his pouch, confidingly, He wore a baby's caul; A thing, as gossip-nurses know, That always brings a squall! 3 His hat was new, or newly glaz'd, Shone brightly in the sun; His jacket, like a mariner's, True blue, as e'er was spun; His ample trowsers, like Saint Paul, Bore forty stripes save one. 4 And now the fretting foaming tide He steer'd away to cross; The bounding pinnace play'd a game Of dreary pitch and toss; A game that, on the good dry land, Is apt to bring a loss! 5 Good Heaven befriend that little boat, And guide her on her way! A boat, they say, has canvas wings, But cannot fly away! Though, like a merry singing-bird, She sits upon the spray! 6 Still east by south the little boat, With tawny sail kept beating: Now out of sight, between two waves, Now o'er th'horizon fleeting: Like greedy swine that feed on mast,â The waves her mast seem'd eating! 7 The sullen sky grew black above, The wave as black beneath; Each roaring billow show'd full soon A white and foamy wreath; Like angry dogs that snarl at first, And then display their teeth. 8 The boatman looked against the wind, The mast began to creak, The wave, per saltum, came and dried, In salt, upon his cheek! The pointed wave against him rear'd, As if it own'd a pique! 9 Nor rushing wind, nor gushing wave, That boatman could alarm, But still he stood away to sea, And trusted in his charm; He thought by purchase he was safe, And arm'd against all harm! 10 Now thick and fast and far aslant, The stormy rain came pouring, He heard upon the sandy bank, The distant breakers roaring,â A groaning intermitting sound, Like Gog and Magog snoring! 11 The seafowl shriek'd around the mast, Ahead the grampus tumbled, And far off, from a copper cloud, The hollow thunder rumbled; It would have quail'd another heart, But his was never humbled. 12 For why? he had that infant's caul; And wherefore should he dread? Alas! alas! he little thought, Before the ebb-tide sped,â That like that infant, he should die, And with a watery head! 13 The rushing brine flowed in apace; His boat had ne'er a deck; Fate seem'd to call him on, and he Attended to her beck; And so he went, still trusting on, Though recklessâto his wreck! 14 For as he left his helm, to heave The ballast-bags a-weather, Three monstrous sea's came roaring on, Like lions leagued together. The two first waves the little boat Swam over like a feather.â 15 The two first waves were past and gone, And sinking in her wake; The hugest still came leaping on, And hissing like a snake; Now helm a-lee! for through the midst The monster he must take! 16 Ah me! it was a dreary mount! Its base as black as night, Its top of pale and livid green, Its crest of awful white, Like Neptune with a leprosy,â And so it rear'd upright! 17 With quaking sails the little boat Climb'd up the foaming heap; With quaking sails it paused awhile. At balance on the steep; Then rushing down the nether slope, Plunged with a dizzy sweep! 18 Look, how a horse, made mad with fear, Disdains his careful guide; So now the headlong headstrong boat, Unmanaged, turns aside, And straight presents her reeling flank Against the swelling tide! 19 The gusty wind assaults the sail; Her ballast lies a-lee! The sheet's to windward, taut and stiff! Oh! the Livelyâwhere is she? Her capsiz'd keel is in the foam, Her pennon's in the sea! 20 The wild gull, sailing overhead, Three times beheld emerge The head of that bold mariner, And then she screamed his dirge! For he had sunk within his grave, Lapp'd in a shroud of surge! 21 The ensuing wave, with horrid foam, Rush'd o'er and covered all,â The jolly boatman's drowning scream Was smother'd by the squall,â Heaven never heard his cry, nor did The ocean heed his caul.</field>

MARY'S GHOST A PATHETIC BALLAD 1 'Twas in the middle of the night, To sleep young William tried, When Mary's ghost came stealing in, And stood at his bed-side. 2 O William dear! O William dear! My rest eternal ceases; Alas! my everlasting peace Is broken into pieces. 3 I thought the last of all my cares Would end with my last minute; But tho' I went to my long home, I didn't stay long in it. 4 The body-snatchers they have come, And made a snatch at me; It's very hard them kind of men Won't let a body be! 5 You thought that I was buried deep Quite decent like and chary, But from her grave in Mary-bone They've come and boned your Mary. 6 The arm that used to take your arm Is took to Dr. Vyse; And both my legs are gone to walk The hospital at Guy's. 7 I vow'd that you should have my hand, But fate gives us denial; You'll find it there, at Dr. Bell's, In spirits and a phial. 8 As for my feet, the little feet You used to call so pretty, There's one, I know, in Bedford Row, The t'other's in the city. 9 I can't tell where my head is gone, But Doctor Carpue can: As for my trunk, it's all pack'd up To go by Pickford's van. 10 I wish you'd go to Mr. P. And save me such a ride; I don't half like the outside place, They've took for my inside. 11 The cock it crowsâI must begone! My William we must part! But I'll be yours in death, altho' Sir Astley has my heart. 12 Don't go to weep upon my grave, And think that there I be; They haven't left an atom there Of my anatomie. THE PROGRESS OF ART O happy time!âArt's early days! When o'er each deed, with sweet self-praise, Narcissus-like I hung! When great Rembrandt but little seem'd, And such Old Masters all were deem'd As nothing to the young! Some scratchy strokesâabrupt and few, So easily and swift I drew, Suffic'd for my design; My sketchy, superficial hand, Drew solids at a dashâand spann'd A surface with a line. Not long my eye was thus content, But grew more criticalâmy bent Essay'd a higher walk; I copied leaden eyes in leadâ Rheumatic hands in white and red, And gouty feetâin chalk. Anon my studious art for days Kept making facesâhappy phrase, For faces such as mine! Accomplish'd in the details then, I left the minor parts of men, And drew the form divine. Old Gods and HeroesâTrojanâGreek, Figuresâlong after the antique, Great Ajax justly feared; Hectors of whom at night I dreamt, And Nestor, fringed enough to tempt Bird-nesters to his beard. A Bacchus, leering on a bowl, A Pallas, that out-star'd her owl, A Vulcanâvery lame; A Dian stuck about with stars, With my right hand I murder'd Marsâ (One Williams did the same.) But tir'd of this dry work at last, Crayon and chalk aside I cast, And gave my brush a drink! Dippingââas when a painter dips In gloom of earthquake and eclipse,ââ That isâin Indian ink. Oh then, what black Mont Blancs arose, Crested with soot, and not with snows, What clouds of dingy hue! In spite of what the Bard has penn'd, I fear the distance did not âlend Enchantment to the view.â Not Radcliffe's brush did e'er design Black Forests, half so black as mine, Or lakes so like a pall; The Chinese cake dispers'd a ray Of darkness, like the light of Day And Martin over all. Yet urchin pride sustain'd me still, I gaz'd on all with right good will, And spread the dingy tint; âNo holy Luke helped me to paint, The Devil surely, not a Saint, Had any finger in't!â But colours came!âlike morning light, With gorgeous hues displacing night. Or Spring's enliven'd scene: At once the sable shades withdrew; My skies got very, very blue; My trees extremely green. And wash'd by my cosmetic brush, How Beauty's cheek began to blush; With locks of auburn stainâ (Not Goldsmith's Auburn)ânut-brown hair, That made her loveliest of the fair; Not âloveliest of the plain!â Her lips were of vermilion hue; Love in her eyes, and Prussian blue, Set all my heart in flame!â A young Pygmalion, I ador'd The maids I madeâbut time was stor'd With evilâand it came! Perspective dawn'dâand soon I saw My houses stand against its law; And âkeepingâ all unkept! My beauties were no longer things For love and fond imaginings; But horrors to be wept! Ah! why did knowledge ope my eyes? Why did I get more artist-wise? It only serves to hint, What grave defects and wants are mine; That I'm no Hilton in designâ In nature no De Wint! Thrice happy time!âArt's early days! When o'er each deed with sweet self-praise, Narcissus-like I hung! When great Rembrandt but little seem'd, And such Old Masters all were deem'd As nothing to the young! A LEGEND OF NAVARRE 'Twas in the reign of Lewis, call'd the Great, As one may read on his triumphal arches, The thing befel I'm going to relate, In course of one of those âpomposoâ marches He lov'd to make, like any gorgeous Persian, Partly for war, and partly for diversion. Some wag had put it in the royal brain To drop a visit at an old chateau, Quite unexpected, with his courtly train; The monarch liked it,âbut it happened so, That Death had got before them by a post, And they were âreckoning without their host,â Who died exactly as a child should die, Without one groan or a convulsive breath, Closing without one pang his quiet eye, Sliding composedly from sleepâto death; A corpse so placid ne'er adorn'd a bed, He seem'd not quiteâbut only rather dead. All night the widow'd Baroness contriv'd To shed a widow's tears; but on the morrow Some news of such unusual sort arriv'd, There came strange alteration in her sorrow; From mouth to mouth it past, one common humming Throughout the houseâthe King! the King is coming! The Baroness, with all her soul and heart, A loyal woman, (now called ultra-loyal,) Soon thrust all funeral concerns apart, And only thought about a banquet-royal; In short, by help of earnest preparation, The visit quite dismiss'd the visitation. And spite of all her grief for the ex-mate, There was a secret hope she could not smother, That some one, early, might replace âthe lateââ It was too soon to think about another; Yet let her minutes of despair be reckon'd Against her hope, which was but for a second. She almost thought that being thus bereft Just then, was one of time's propitious touches; A thread in such a nick so nicked, it left Free opportunity to be a duchess; Thus all her care was only to look pleasant, But as for tearsâshe dropp'd themâfor the present. Her household, as good servants ought to try, Look'd like their ladyâany thing but sad, And giggled even that they might not cry, To damp fine company; in truth they had No time to mourn, thro' choking turkeys' throttles, Scouring old laces, and reviewing bottles. Oh what a hubbub for the house of woe! All, resolute to one irresolution, Kept tearing, swearing, plunging to and fro, Just like another French mob-revolution. There lay the corpse that could not stir a muscle, But all the rest seem'd Chaos in a bustle. The Monarch came: Oh! who could ever guess The Baroness had been so late a weeper! The kingly grace and more than graciousness, Buried the poor defunct some fathoms deeper,â Could he have had a glanceâalas, poor Being! Seeing would certainly have led to D?ing. For casting round about her eyes to find Some one to whom her chattels to endorse, The comfortable dame at last inclin'd To choose the cheerful Master of the Horse; He was so gay,âso tender,âthe complete Nice man,âthe sweetest of the monarch's suite. He saw at once and enter'd in the listsâ Glance unto glance made amorous replies; They talk'd together like two egotists, In conversation all made up of eyes; No couple ever got so right consort-ish Within two hoursâa courtship rather shortish. At last, some sleepy, some by wine opprest, The courtly company began ânid noddin;â The King first sought his chamber, and the rest Instanter followed by the course he trod in. I shall not please the scandalous by showing The order, or disorder of their going. The old Chateau, before that night, had never Held half so many underneath its roof; It task'd the Baroness's best endeavour, And put her best contrivance to the proof, To give them chambers up and down the stairs, In twos and threes, by singles, and by pairs. She had just lodging for the wholeâyet barely; And some, that were both broad of back and tall, Lay on spare beds that served them very sparely; However, there were beds enough for all; But living bodies occupied so many, She could not let the dead one take up any! The act was, certainly, not over decent: Some small respect, e'en after death she ow'd him, Considering his death had been so recent; However, by command, her servants stow'd him, (I am asham'd to think how he was slubber'd,) Stuck bolt upright within a corner cupboard! And there he slept as soundly as a post, With no more pillow than an oaken shelf: Just like a kind accommodating host, Taking all inconvenience on himself; None else slept in that room, except a stranger, A decent man, a sort of Forest Ranger. Who, whether he had gone too soon to bed, Or dreamt himself into an appetite, Howbeit, he took a longing to be fed, About the hungry middle of the night; So getting forth, he sought some scrap to eat, Hopeful of some stray pasty or cold meat. The casual glances of the midnight moon, Bright'ning some antique ornaments of brass, Guided his gropings to that corner soon, Just where it stood, the coffin-safe, alas! He tried the doorâthen shook itâand in course Of time it opened to a little force. He put one hand in, and began to grope; The place was very deep and quite as dark as The middle night;âwhen lo! beyond his hope, He felt a something cold, in fact, the carcase; Right overjoy'd, he laugh'd, and blest his luck At finding, as he thought, this haunch of buck! Then striding back for his couteau-de-chasse, Determin'd on a little midnight lunching, He came again and probed about the mass, As if to find the fattest bit for munching; Not meaning wastefully to cut it all up, But only to abstract a little collop. But just as he had struck one greedy stroke, His hand fell down quite powerless and weak; For when he cut the haunch it plainly spoke As haunch of ven'son never ought to speak; No wonder that his hand could go no furtherâ Whose could?âto carve cold meat that bellow'd, âmurther!â Down came the Body with a bounce, and down The Ranger sprang, a staircase at a spring, And bawl'd enough to waken up a town; Some thought that they were murder'd, some, the King, And, like Macduff, did nothing for a season, But stand upon the spot and bellow, âTreason!â A hundred nightcaps gathered in a mob, Torches drew torches, swords brought swords together, It seem'd so dark and perilous a job; The Baroness came trembling like a feather Just in the rear, as pallid as a corse, Leaning against the Master of the Horse. A dozen of the bravest up the stair, Well lighted and well watch'd, began to clamber; They sought the doorâthey found itâthey were thereâ A dozen heads went poking in the chamber; And lo! with one hand planted on his hurt, There stood the Body bleeding thro' his shirt,â No passive corseâbut like a duellist Just smarting from a scratchâin fierce position, One hand advanc'd, and ready to resist; In fact, the Baron doff'd the apparition, Swearing those oaths the French delight in most, And for the second time âgave up the ghost!â A living miracle!âfor why?âthe knife That cuts so many off from grave grey hairs, Had only carv'd him kindly into life. How soon it changed the posture of affairs! The difference one person more or less Will make in families, is past all guess. There stood the Baronessâno widow yet: Here stood the Baronââin the bodyâ still: There stood the Horses' Master in a pet, Choking with disappointment's bitter pill, To see the hope of his reversion fail, Like that of riding on a donkey's tail. The Baron liv'dâ'twas nothing but a trance: The lady diedâ'twas nothing but a death: The cupboard-cut serv'd only to enhance This postscript to the old Baronial breath:â He soon forgave, for the revival's sake, A little chop intended for a steak! THE DEMON-SHIP 'Twas off the Washâthe sun went downâthe sea look'd black and grim, For stormy clouds, with murky fleece, were mustering at the brim; Titanic shades! enormous gloom!âas if the solid night Of Erebus rose suddenly to seize upon the light! It was a time for mariners to bear a wary eye, With such a dark conspiracy between the sea and sky! Down went my helmâclose reef'dâthe tack held freely in my handâ With ballast snugâI put about, and scudded for the land. Loud hiss'd the sea beneath her leeâmy little boat flew fast, But faster still the rushing storm came borne upon the blast. Lord! what a roaring hurricane beset the straining sail! What furious sleet, with level drift, and fierce assaults of hail! What darksome caverns yawn'd before! what jagged steeps behind! Like battle-steeds, with foamy manes, wild tossing in the wind. Each after each sank down astern, exhausted in the chase, But where it sank another rose and gallop'd in its place; As black as nightâthey turned to white, and cast against the cloud A snowy sheet, as if each surge upturn'd a sailor's shroud:â Still flew my boat; alas! alas! her course was nearly run! Behold yon fatal billow riseâten billows heap'd in one! With fearful speed the dreary mass came rolling, rolling, fast, As if the scooping sea contain'd one only wave at last! Still on it came, with horrid roar, a swift pursuing grave; It seem'd as though some cloud had turn'd its hugeness to a wave! Its briny sleet began to beat beforehand in my faceâ I felt the rearward keel begin to climb its swelling base! I saw its alpine hoary head impending over mine! Another pulseâand down it rush'dâan avalanche of brine! Brief pause had I, on God to cry, or think of wife and home; The waters clos'dâand when I shriek'd, I shriek'd below the foam! Beyond that rush I have no hint of any after deedâ For I was tossing on the waste, as senseless as a weed. âWhere am I? in the breathing world, or in the world of death?â With sharp and sudden pang I drew another birth of breath; My eyes drank in a doubtful light, my ears a doubtful soundâ And was that ship a real ship whose tackle seem'd around? A moon, as if the earthly moon, was shining up aloft; But were those beams the very beams that I had seen so oft? A face, that mock'd the human face, before me watch'd alone; But were those eyes the eyes of man that look'd against my own? Oh! never may the moon again disclose me such a sight As met my gaze, when first I look'd, on that accursed night! I've seen a thousand horrid shapes begot of fierce extremes Of fever; and most frightful things have haunted in my dreamsâ Hyenasâcatsâblood-loving batsâand apes with hateful stare,â Pernicious snakes, and shaggy bullsâthe lion, and she-bearâ Strong enemies, with Judas looks, of treachery and spiteâ Detested features, hardly dimm'd and banish'd by the light! Pale-sheeted ghosts, with gory locks, upstarting from their tombsâ All phantasies and images that flit in midnight gloomsâ Hags, goblins, demons, lemures, have made me all aghast,â But nothing like that Grimly One who stood beside the mast! His cheek was blackâhis brow was blackâhis eyes and hair as dark: His hand was black, and where it touch'd, it left a sable mark; His throat was black, his vest the same, and when I look'd beneath, His breast was blackâall, all, was black except his grinning teeth. His sooty crew were like in hue, as black as Afric slaves! Oh, horror! e'en the ship was black that plough'd the inky waves! âAlas!â I cried, âfor love of truth and blessed mercy's sake, Where am I? in what dreadful ship? upon what dreadful lake? What shape is that, so very grim, and black as any coal? It is Mahound, the Evil One, and he has gain'd my soul! Oh, mother dear! my tender nurse! dear meadows that beguil'd My happy days, when I was yet a little sinless child,â My mother dearâmy native fields, I never more shall see: I'm sailing in the Devil's Ship, upon the Devil's Sea!â Loud laugh'd that Sable Mariner, and loudly in return His sooty crew sent forth a laugh that rang from stem to sternâ A dozen pair of grimly cheeks were crumpled on the nonceâ As many sets of grinning teeth came shining out at once: A dozen gloomy shapes at once enjoy'd the merry fit, With shriek and yell, and oaths as well, like Demons of the Pit. They crow'd their fill, and then the Chief made answer for the whole:â âOur skins,â said he, âare black ye see, because we carry coal; You'll find your mother sure enough, and see your native fieldsâ For this here ship has pick'd you upâthe Mary Ann of Shields!â TIM TURPIN A PATHETIC BALLAD Tim Turpin he was gravel blind, And ne'er had seen the skies: For Nature, when his head was made, Forgot to dot his eyes. So, like a Christmas pedagogue, Poor Tim was forc'd to doâ Look out for pupils, for he had A vacancy for two. There's some have specs to help their sight Of objects dim and small: But Tim had specks within his eyes, And could not see at all. Now Tim he woo'd a servant-maid, And took her to his arms; For he, like Pyramus, had cast A wall-eye on her charms. By day she led him up and down Where'er he wish'd to jog, A happy wife, altho' she led The life of any dog. But just when Tim had liv'd a month In honey with his wife, A surgeon ope'd his Milton eyes, Like oysters, with a knife. But when his eyes were open'd thus, He wish'd them dark again: For when he look'd upon his wife, He saw her very plain. Her face was bad, her figure worse, He couldn't bear to eat: For she was any thing but like A Grace before his meat. Now Tim he was a feeling man: For when his sight was thick, It made him feel for everything,â But that was with a stick. So with a cudgel in his handâ It was not light or slimâ He knocked at his wife's head until It open'd unto him. And when the corpse was stiff and cold, He took his slaughter'd spouse, And laid her in a heap with all The ashes of her house. But like a wicked murderer, He liv'd in constant fear From day to day, and so he cut His throat from ear to ear. The neighbours fetch'd a doctor in: Said he, this wound I dread Can hardly be sew'd upâhis life Is hanging on a thread. But when another week was gone, He gave him stronger hopeâ Instead of hanging on a thread, Of hanging on a rope. Ah! when he hid his bloody work In ashes round about, How little he supposed the truth Would soon be sifted out. But when the parish dustman came, His rubbish to withdraw, He found more dust within the heap Than he contracted for! A dozen men to try the fact, Were sworn that very day; But though they all were jurors, yet No conjurors were they. Said Tim unto those jurymen, You need not waste your breath, For I confess myself at once The author of her death. And, oh! when I reflect upon The blood that I have spilt, Just like a button is my soul, Inscrib'd with double guilt! Then turning round his head again, He saw before his eyes, A great judge, and a little judge, The judges of a-size! The great judge took his judgment cap, And put it on his head, And sentenc'd Tim by law to hang 'Till he was three times dead. So he was tried, and he was hung (Fit punishment for such) On Horsham-drop, and none can say It was a drop too much. THE MONKEY-MARTYR A FABLE âGod help thee, said I, but I'll let thee out, cost what it will: so I turned about the cage to get to the door.â âSterne. 1 'Tis strange, what awkward figures and odd capers Folks cut, who seek their doctrine from the papers; But there are many shallow politicians, Who take their bias from bewilder'd journalsâ Turn state-physicians, And make themselves fools'-caps of the diurnals. 2 One of this kind, not human, but a monkey, Had read himself at last to this sour creedâ That he was nothing but Oppression's flunkey, And man a tyrant over all his breed. He could not read Of niggers whipt, or over-trampled weavers, But he applied their wrongs to his own seed, And nourish'd thoughts that threw him into fevers. His very dreams were full of martial beavers, And drilling Pugs, for liberty pugnacious, To sever chains vexations. In fact, he thought that all his injured line Should take up pikes in hand, and never drop 'em Till they had clear'd a road to Freedom's shrine, Unless perchance the turnpike men should stop 'em. 3 Full of this rancour, Pacing one day beside St. Clement Danes, It came into his brains To give a look in at the Crown and Anchor; Where certain solemn sages of the nation Were at that moment in deliberation How to relieve the wide world of its chains, Pluck despots down, And thereby crown Whitee-as well as blackee-man-cipation. Pug heard the speeches with great approbation, And gazed with pride upon the Liberators; To see mere coalheavers Such perfect Bolivarsâ Waiters of inns sublimed to innovators, And slaters dignified as legislatorsâ Small publicans demanding (such their high sense Of liberty) an universal licenceâ And patten-makers easing Freedom's clogsâ The whole thing seem'd So fine, he deem'd The smallest demagogues as great as Gogs! 4 Pug, with some curious notions in his noddle, Walk'd out at last, and turn'd into the Strand, To the left hand, Conning some portions of the previous twaddle, And striding with a step that seem'd design'd To represent the mighty March of Mind, Instead of that slow waddle Of thought, to which our ancestors inclined. No wonder, then, that he should quickly find He stood in front of that intrusive pile, Where Cross keeps many a kind Of bird confin'd, And free-born animal, in durance vileâ A thought that stirred up all the monkey-bile. 5 The window stood ajarâ It was not far, Nor, like Parnassus, very hard to climbâ The hour was verging on the supper-time, And many a growl was sent through many a bar. Meanwhile Pug scrambled upward like a tar, And soon crept in, Unnotic'd in the din Of tuneless throats, that made the attics ring With all the harshest notes that they could bring; For like the Jews, Wild beasts refuse In midst of their captivityâto sing. 6 Lord! how it made him chafe, Full of his new emancipating zeal, To look around upon this brute-bastille, And see the king of creatures inâa safe! The desert's denizen in one small den, Swallowing slavery's most bitter pillsâ A bear in bars unbearable. And then The fretful porcupine, with all its quills Imprison'd in a pen! A tiger limited to four feet ten; And, still worse lot, A leopard to one spot! An elephant enlarged, But not discharged, (It was before the elephant was shot;) A doleful wanderow, that wandered not; An ounce much disproportion'd to his pound. Pug's wrath wax'd hot To gaze upon these captive creatures round; Whose clawsâall scratchingâgave him full assurance They found their durance vile of vile endurance. 7 He went aboveâa solitary mounter Up gloomy stairsâand saw a pensive group Of hapless fowlsâ Cranes, vultures, owls, In fact, it was a sort of Poultry-Compter, Where feather'd prisoners were doom'd to droop: Here sat an eagle, forced to make a stoop, Not from the skies, but his impending roof; And there aloof, A pining ostrich, moping in a coop; With other samples of the bird creation, All caged against their powers and their wills, And cramp'd in such a space, the longest bills Were plainly bills of least accommodation. In truth, it was a very ugly scene To fall to any liberator's share, To see those winged fowls, that once had been Free as the wind, no freer than fix'd air. 8 His temper little mended, Pug from this Bird-cage Walk at last descended Unto the lion and the elephant, His bosom in a pant To see all nature's Free List thus suspended, And beasts deprived of what she had intended. They could not even prey In their own way; A hardship always reckon'd quite prodigious. Thus he revolvedâ And soon resolved To give them freedom, civil and religious. 9 That night there were no country cousins, raw From Wales, to view the lion and his kin: The keeper's eyes were fix'd upon a saw; The saw was fix'd upon a bullock's shin: Meanwhile with stealthy paw, Pug hasten'd to withdraw The bolt that kept the king of brutes within. Now, monarch of the forest! thou shalt win Precious enfranchisementâthy bolts are undone; Thou art no longer a degraded creature, But loose to roam with liberty and nature; And free of all the jungles about Londonâ All Hampstead's heathy desert lies before thee Methinks I see thee bound from Cross's ark, Full of the native instinct that comes o'er thee, And turn a ranger Of Hounslow Forest and the Regent's Parkâ Thin Rhodes's cowsâthe mail-coach steeds endanger, And gobble parish watchmen after dark:â Methinks I see thee, with the early lark, Stealing to Merlin's caveâ(thy cave).âAlas, That such bright visions should not come to pass! Alas, for freedom, and for freedom's hero! Alas, for liberty of life and limb! For Pug had only half unbolted Nero, When Nero bolted him! CRANIOLOGY 'Tis strange how like a very dunce, Manâwith his bumps upon his sconce Has lived so long, and yet no knowledge he Has had till lately, of Phrenologyâ A science that by simple dint of Head-combing, he should find a hint of When scratching o'er those little poll-hills, The faculties throw up like mole-hills; A science that, in very spite Of all his teeth, ne'er came to light, For tho' he knew his skull had grinders, Still there turn'd up no organ finders, Still sages wrote, and ages fled, And no man's head came in his headâ Not even the pate of Erra Pater, Knew aught about its pia mater. At last great Dr. Gall bestirs himâ I don't know but it might be Spurzheimâ Tho' native of a dull and slow land, And makes partition of our Poll-land; At our Acquisitiveness guesses, And all those necessary nesses Indicative of human habits, All burrowing in the head like rabbits. Thus Veneration, he made known, Had got a lodging at the Crown: And Music (see Deville's example) A set of chambers in the Temple: That Language taught the tongues close by, And took in pupils thro' the eye, Close by his neighbour Computation, Who taught the eyebrows numeration. The science thusâto speak in fit Termsâhaving struggled from its nit, Was seiz'd on by a swarm of Scotchmen, Those scientifical hotch-potch men Who have at least a penny dip And wallop in all doctorship, Just as in making broth they smatter By bobbing twenty things in water: These men, I say, made quick appliance And close, to phrenologic science; For of all learned themes whatever, That schools and colleges deliver, There's none they love so near the bodles, As analysing their own noddles; Thus in a trice each northern blockhead Had got his fingers in his shock head, And of his bumps was babbling yet worse Than poor Miss Capulet's dry-wet-nurse; Till having been sufficient rangers Of their own heads, they took to strangers', And found in Presbyterians' polls The things they hated in their souls; For Presbyterians hear with passion Of organs join'd with veneration. No kind there was of human pumpkin But at its bumps it had a bumpkin; Down to the very lowest gullion, And oiliest skull of oily scullion. No great man died but this they did do, They begged his cranium of his widow: No murderer died by law disaster, But they took off his sconce in plaster; For thereon they could show depending, âThe head and front of his offending,â How that his philanthropic bump Was master'd by a baser lump; For every bump (these wags insist) Has its direct antagonist, Each striving stoutly to prevail, Like horses knotted tail to tail; And many a stiff and sturdy battle Occurs between these adverse cattle: The secret cause, beyond all question, Of aches ascrib'd to indigestion,â Whereas 'tis but two knobby rivals Tugging together like sheer devils, Till one gets mastery good or sinister, And comes in like a new prime-minister. Each bias in some master node is:â What takes M'Adam where a road is, To hammer little pebbles less? His organ of Destructiveness. What makes great Joseph so encumber Debate? a lumping lump of Number: Or Malthus rail at babies so? The smallness of his Philoproâ What severs man and wife? a simple Defect of the Adhesive pimple: Or makes weak women go astray? Their bumps are more in fault than they. These facts being found and set in order By grave M.D.'s beyond the Border, To make them for some few months eternal, Were entered monthly in a journal, That many a northern sage still writes in, And throws his little Northern Lights in, And proves and proves about the phrenos, A great deal more than I or he knows: How Music suffers, par exemple, By wearing tight hats round the temple; What ills great boxers have to fear From blisters put behind the ear: And how a porter's Veneration Is hurt by porter's occupation; Whether shillelaghs in reality May deaden Individuality: Or tongs and poker be creative Of alterations in th'Amative; If falls from scaffolds make us less Inclin'd to all Constructiveness: With more such matters, all applying To headsâand therefore headifying. JACK HALL 'Tis very hard when men forsake This melancholy world, and make A bed of turf, they cannot take A quiet doze, But certain rogues will come and break Their âbone repose.â 'Tis hard we can't give up our breath, And to the earth our earth bequeath, Without Death Fetches after death, Who thus exhume us; And snatch us from our homes beneath And hearths posthumous. The tender lover comes to rear The mournful urn, and shed his tearâ Her glorious dust, he cries, is here! Alack! alack! The while his Sacharissa dear Is in a sack! 'Tis hard one cannot lie amid The mould, beneath a coffin-lid, But thus the Faculty will bid Their rogues break thro' it! If they don't want us there, why did They send us to it? One of these sacrilegious knaves, Who crave as hungry vulture craves, Behaving as the goul behaves, 'Neath church-yard wallâ Mayhap because he fed on graves, Was nam'd Jack Hall. By day it was his trade to go Tending the black coach to and fro; And sometimes at the door of woe, With emblems suitable, He stood with brother Mute, to show That life is mutable. But long before they pass'd the ferry, The dead that he had help'd to bury He sack'dâ(he had a sack to carry The bodies off in.) In fact, he let them have a very Short fit of coffin. Night after night, with crow and spade, He drove this dead but thriving trade, Meanwhile his conscience never weigh'd A single horsehair; On corses of all kinds he prey'd, A perfect corsair! At lastâit may be, Death took spite Or jesting only meant to frightâ He sought for Jack night after night The churchyards round; And soon they met, the man and sprite, In Pancras' ground. Jack, by the glimpses of the moon, Perceiv'd the bony knacker soon, An awful shape to meet at noon Of night and lonely; But Jack's tough courage did but swoon A minute only. Anon he gave his spade a swing Aloft, and kept it brandishing, Ready for what mishaps might spring From this conjunction; Funking indeed was quite a thing Beside his function. âHollo!â cried Death, âd'ye wish your sands Run out? the stoutest never stands A chance with me,âto my commands The strongest truckles; But I'm your friendâso let's shake hands, I should sayâknuckles.â Jack, glad to see th'old sprite so sprightly, And meaning nothing but uprightly, Shook hands at once, and, bowing slightly, His mull did proffer: But Death, who had no nose, politely Declin'd the offer. Then sitting down upon a bank, Leg over leg, shank over shank, Like friends for conversation frank, That had no check on: Quoth Jack unto the Lean and Lank, âYou're Death, I reckon.â The Jaw-bone grinn'd:ââI am that same, You've hit exactly on my name; In truth it has some little fame Where burial sod is.â Quoth Jack (and wink'd), âof course ye came Here after bodies.â Death grinn'd again and shook his head:â âI've little business with the dead; When they are fairly sent to bed I've done my turn: Whether or not the worms are fed Is your concern. âMy errand here, in meeting you, Is nothing but a how-d'ye-do; I've done what jobs I hadâa few, Along this way; If I can serve a crony too, I beg you'll say.â Quoth Jack, âYour Honour's very kind: And now I call the thing to mind, This parish very strick I find; But in the next 'un There lives a very well-inclin'd Old sort of sexton.â Death took the hint, and gave a wink As well as eyelet holes can blink; Then stretching out his arm to link The other's arm,â âSuppose,â says he, âwe have a drink Of something warm.â Jack nothing loth, with friendly ease Spoke up at once:ââWhy, what ye please; Hard by there is the Cheshire Cheese, A famous tap.â But this suggestion seem'd to tease The bony chap. âNo, noâyour mortal drinks are heady, And only make my hand unsteady; I do not even care for Deady, And loathe your rum; But I've some glorious brewage ready, My drink isâmum!â And off they set, each right contentâ Who knows the dreary way they went? But Jack felt rather faint and spent, And out of breath; At last he saw, quite evident, The Door of Death. All other men had been unmann'd To see a coffin on each hand, That served a skeleton to stand By way of sentry; In fact, Death has a very grand And awful entry. Throughout his dismal sign prevails, His name is writ in coffin nails, The mortal darts make area rails; A scull that mocketh, Grins on the gloomy gate, and quails Whoever knocketh. And lo! on either side, arise Two monstrous pillarsâbones of thighs; A monumental slab supplies The step of stone, Where waiting for his master lies, A dog of bone. The dog leapt up, but gave no yell, The wire was pull'd, but woke no bell, The ghastly knocker rose and fell, But caused no riot; The ways of Death, we all know well Are very quiet. Old Bones stepped in; Jack stepp'd behind: Quoth Death, âI really hope you'll find The entertainment to your mind, As I shall treat yeâ A friend or two of goblin kind I've asked to meet ye.â And lo! a crowd of spectres tall, Like jack-a-lanterns on a wall, Were standingâevery ghastly ball An eager watcher. âMy friends,â says Deathââfriends, Mr. Hall, The body-snatcher.â Lord! what a tumult it produc'd, When Mr. Hall was introduced! Jack even, who had long been used To frightful things, Felt just as if his back was sluic'd With freezing springs! Each goblin face began to make Some horrid mouthâapeâgorgonâsnake; And then a spectre-hag would shake An airy thigh-bone; And cried, (or seem'd to cry,) I'll break Your bone, with my bone! Some ground their teethâsome seem'd to spitâ (Nothing, but nothing came of it,) A hundred awful brows were knit In dreadful spite. Thought JackâI'm sure I'd better quit, Without good-night. One skip and hop and he was clear, And running like a hunted deer, As fleet as people run by fear Well spurr'd and whipp'd, Death, ghosts, and all in that career Were quite outstripp'd. But those who live by death must die; Jack's soul at last prepar'd to fly; And when his latter end drew nigh, Oh! what a swarm Of doctors came,âbut not to try To keep him warm. No ravens ever scented prey So early where a dead horse lay, Nor vultures sniff'd so far away A last convulse; A dozen âguestsâ day after day Were âat his pulse.â 'Twas strange, altho' they got no fees, How still they watch'd by twos and threes: But Jack a very little ease Obtain'd from them; In fact, he did not find M.D.'s Worth one D?M. The passing bell with hollow toll Was in his thoughtâthe dreary hole! Jack gave his eyes a horrid roll, And then a cough. âThere's something weighing on my soul I wish was off; âAll night it roves about my brains, All day it adds to all my pains, It is concerning my remains When I am dead;â Twelve wigs and twelve gold-headed canes Drew near his bed. âAlas!â he sighed, âI'm sore afraid, A dozen pangs my heart invade; But when I drove a certain trade In flesh and bone, There was a little bargain made About my own.â Twelve suits of black began to close, Twelve pair of sleek and sable hose, Twelve flowing cambric frills in rows, At once drew round; Twelve noses turn'd against his nose, Twelve snubs profound. âTen guineas did not quite suffice, And so I sold my body twice; Twice did not doâI sold it thrice, Forgive my crimes! In short I have received its price A dozen times!â Twelve brows got very grim and black, Twelve wishes stretch'd him on the rack, Twelve pair of hands for fierce attack Took up position, Ready to share the dying Jack By long division. Twelve angry doctors wrangled so, That twelve had struck an hour ago, Before they had an eye to throw On the departed; Twelve heads turn'd round at once, and lo! Twelve doctors started. Whether some comrade of the dead, Or Satan took it in his head, To steal the corpseâthe corpse had fled! 'Tis only written, That âthere was nothing in the bed, But twelve were bitten!â THE WEE MAN A ROMANCE It was a merry company, And they were just afloat, When lo! a man of dwarfish span Came up and hail'd the boat. âGood morrow to ye, gentle folks, And will you let me in?â A slender space will serve my case, For I am small and thin.â They saw he was a dwarfish man, And very small and thin; Not seven such would matter much, And so they took him in. They laugh'd to see his little hat, With such a narrow brim; They laugh'd to note his dapper coat, With skirts so scant and trim. But barely had they gone a mile, When, gravely, one and all, At once began to think the man Was not so very small: His coat had got a broader skirt, His hat a broader brim, His leg grew stout, and soon plump'd out A very proper limb. Still on they went, and as they went, More rough the billows grew,â And rose and fell, a greater swell, And he was swelling too! And lo! where room had been for seven, For six there scarce was space! For five!âfor four!âfor three!ânot more Than two could find a place! There was not even room for one! They crowded by degreesâ Ayeâcloser yet, till elbows met, And knees were jogging knees. âGood sir, you must not sit a-stern, The wave will else come in!â Without a word he gravely stirr'd, Another seat to win. âGood sir, the boat has lost her trim, You must not sit a-lee!â With smiling face, and courteous grace, The middle seat took he. But still, by constant quiet growth, His back became so wide, Each neighbour wight, to left and right, Was thrust against the side. Lord! how they chided with themselves, That they had let him in; To see him grow so monstrous now, That came so small and thin. On every brow a dew-drop stood, They grew so scared and hot,â âI' the name of all that's great and tall, Who are ye, sir, and what?â Loud laugh'd the Gogmagog, a laugh As loud as giant's roarâ âWhen first I came, my proper name Was Littleânow I'm Moore!â A BUTCHER Whoe'er has gone thro' London Street, Has seen a Butcher gazing at his meat, And how he keeps Gloating upon a sheep's Or bullock's personals, as if his own; How he admires his halves And quartersâand his calves, As if in truth upon his own legs grown;â His fat! his suet! His kidneys peeping elegantly thro' it! His thick flank! And his thin! His shank! His shin! Skin of his skin, and bone too of his bone! With what an air He stands aloof, across the thoroughfare Gazingâand will not let a body by, Tho' buy! buy! buy! be constantly his cry. Meanwhile with arms a-kimbo, and a pair Of Rhodian legs he revels in a stare, At his Joint Stockâfor one may call it so, Howbeit, without a Co. The dotage of self-love was never fonder Than he of his brute bodies all a-row; Narcissus in the wave did never ponder With love so strong, On his âportrait charmant,â As our vain Butcher on his carcase yonder. Look at his sleek round skull! How bright his cheek, how rubicund his nose is! His visage seems to be Ripe for beef-tea; Of brutal juices the whole man is full.â In fact, fulfilling the metempsychosis, The Butcher is already half a Bull. âDON'T YOU SMELL FIRE?â Run!ârun for St. Clement's engine! For the Pawnbroker's all in a blaze, And the pledges are frying and singeingâ Oh! how the poor pawners will craze! Now where can the turncock be drinking? Was there ever so thirsty an elf?â But he still may tope on, for I'm thinking That the plugs are as dry as himself. The engines!âI hear them come rumbling; There's the PhÅnix! the Globe! and the Sun! What a row there will be, and a grumbling, When the water don't start for a run! See! there they come racing and tearing, All the street with loud voices is fill'd; Oh! it's only the firemen a-swearing At a man they've run over and kill'd! How sweetly the sparks fly away now, And twinkle like stars in the sky; It's a wonder the engines don't play now, But I never saw water so shy! Why there isn't enough for a snipe, And the fire it is fiercer, alas! Oh! instead of the New River pipe, They have goneâthat they haveâto the gas! Only look at the poor little P?'s On the roofâis there anything sadder? My dears, keep fast hold, if you please, And they won't be an hour with the ladder! But if any one's hot in their feet, And in very great haste to be sav'd, Here's a nice easy bit in the street, That M'Adam has lately unpav'd! There is some oneâI see a dark shape At that window, the hottest of all,â My good woman, why don't you escape? Never think of your bonnet and shawl: If your dress isn't perfect, what is it For once in a way to your hurt? When your husband is paying a visit There, at Number Fourteen, in his shirt! Only see how she throws out her chaney! Her basons, and teapots, and all The most brittle of her goodsâor any, But they all break in breaking their fall: Such things are not surely the best From a two-storey window to throwâ She might save a good iron-bound chest, For there's plenty of people below! O dear! what a beautiful flash! How it shone thro' the window and door; We shall soon hear a scream and a crash, When the woman falls thro' with the floor! There! there! what a volley of flame, And then suddenly all is obscur'd! WellâI'm glad in my heart that I came:â But I hope the poor man is insur'd! THE VOLUNTEER âThe clashing of my armour in my ears Sounds like a passing bell; my buckler puts me In mind of bier; this, my broadsword, a pickaxe To dig my grave.â âThe Lover's Progress. 'Twas in that memorable year France threaten'd to put off in Flat-bottom'd boats, intending each To be a British coffin, To make sad widows of our wives, And every babe an orphan;â When coats were made of scarlet cloaks, And heads were dredg'd with flour, I 'listed in the Lawyers' Corps, Against the battle hour; A perfect Volunteerâfor why? I brought my âwill and pow'r.â One dreary dayâa day of dread, Like Cato's, over-castâ About the hour of six, (the morn And I were breaking fast,) There came a loud and sudden sound, That struck me all aghast! A dismal sort of morning roll, That was not to be eaten; Although it was no skin of mine, But parchment that was beaten, I felt tattooed through all my flesh, Like any Otaheitan. My jaws with utter dread enclos'd The morsel I was munching, And terror lock'd them up so tight, My very teeth went crunching All through my bread and tongue at once, Like sandwich made at lunching. My hand that held the tea-pot fast, Stiffen'd, but yet unsteady, Kept pouring, pouring, pouring o'er The cup in one long eddy, Till both my hose were marked with tea, As they were mark'd already. I felt my visage turn from red To whiteâfrom cold to hot; But it was nothing wonderful My colour changed, I wot, For, like some variable silks, I felt that I was shot. And looking forth with anxious eye, From my snug upper storey, I saw our melancholy corps, Going to beds all gory; The pioneers seem'd very loth To axe their way to glory. The captain march'd as mourners march, The ensign too seem'd lagging, And many more, although they were No ensigns, took to flaggingâ Like corpses in the Serpentine, Methought they wanted dragging. But while I watch'd, the thought of death Came like a chilly gust, And lo! I shut the window down, With very little lust To join so many marching men, That soon might be March dust. Quoth I, âsince Fate ordains it so, Our foe the coast must land on;â I felt so warm beside the fire I cared not to abandon; Our hearths and homes are always things That patriots make a stand on. âThe fools that fight abroad for home,â Thought I, âmay get a wrong one; Let those that have no homes at all Go battle for a long one.â The mirror here confirm'd me this Reflection, by a strong one: For there, where I was wont to shave, And deck me like Adonis, There stood the leader of our foes, With vultures for his croniesâ No Corsican, but Death himself, The Bony of all Bonies. A horrid sight it was, and sad, To see the grisly chap Put on my crimson livery, And then begin to clap My helmet onâah me! it felt Like any felon's cap. My plume seem'd borrow'd from a hearse, An undertaker's crest; My epaulettes like coffin-plates; My belt so heavy press'd, Four pipeclay cross-roads seem'd to lie At once upon my breast. My brazen breast-plate only lack'd A little heap of salt, To make me like a corpse full dress'd, Preparing for the vaultâ To set up what the Poet calls My everlasting halt. This funeral show inclin'd me quite To peace:âand here I am! Whilst better lions go to war, Enjoying with the lamb A lengthen'd life, that might have been A martial epigram. THE WIDOW One widow at a grave will sob A little while, and weep, and sigh; If two should meet on such a job, They'll have a gossip by and by. If three should come togetherâwhy, Three widows are good company! If four should meet by any chance, Four is a number very nice, To have a rubber in a triceâ But five will up and have a dance! Poor Mrs. C?(why should I not Declare her name?âher name was Cross) Was one of those the âcommon lotâ Had left to weep âno common lossââ For she had lately buried then A man, the âvery best of men,â A lingering truth, discover'd first Whenever men âare at the worst.â To take the measure of her woe, It was some dozen inches deepâ I mean in crape, and hung so low, It hid the drops she did not weep: In fact, what human life appears, It was, a perfect âveil of tears.â Though ever since she lost âher prop And stay,ââalas! he wouldn't stayâ She never had a tear to mop, Except one little angry drop, From Passion's eye, as Moore would say; Because, when Mister Cross took flight, It look'd so very like a spiteâ He died upon a washing-day! Still Widow Cross went twice a week, As if to âwet a widow's cheek,â And soothe his grave with sorrow's gravy,â 'Twas nothing but a make-believe, She might as well have hoped to grieve Enough of brine to float a navy; And yet she often seem'd to raise A cambric kerchief to her eyeâ A duster ought to be the phrase, Its work was all so very dry. The springs were lock'd that ought to flowâ In England or in widow-womanâ As those that watch the weather know, Such âbackward Springsâ are not uncommon. But why did Widow Cross take pains To call upon the âdear remains,ââ Remains that could not tell a jot Whether she ever wept or not, Or how his relict took her losses? Oh! my black ink turns red for shameâ But still the naughty world must learn There was a little German came To shed a tear in âAnna's Urn,â At the next grave to Mr. Cross's! For there an angel's virtues slept, âToo soon did Heav'n assert its claim!â But still her painted face he kept, âEncompass'd in an angel's frame.â He look'd quite sad, and quite depriv'd, His head was nothing but a hat-band; He look'd so lone, and so unwiv'd, That soon the Widow Cross contriv'd To fall in love with even that band; And all at once the brackish juices Came gushing out thro' sorrow's sluicesâ Tear after tear too fast to wipe, Tho' sopp'd, and sopp'd, and sopp'd againâ No leak in sorrow's private pipe, But like a bursting on the main! Whoe'er has watch'd the windowpaneâ I mean to say in showery weatherâ Has seen two little drops of rain, Like lovers very fond and fain, At one another creeping, creeping, Till both, at last, embrace together: So far'd it with that couple's weeping! The principle was quite as activeâ Tear unto tear Kept drawing near, Their very blacks became attractive. To cut a shortish story shorter, Conceive them sitting tÃªte-Ã -tÃªteâ Two cupsâhot muffins on a plateâ With âAnna's Urnâ to hold hot water! The brazen vessel for a while Had lectured in an easy song, Like Abernethyâon the bileâ The scalded herb was getting strong; All seem'd as smooth as smooth could be, To have a cosey cup of tea; Alas! how often human sippers With unexpected bitters meet, And buds, the sweetest of the sweet, Like sugar, only meet the nippers! The Widow Cross, I should have told, Had seen three husbands to the mould; She never sought an Indian pyre, Like Hindoo wives that lose their loves, But, with a proper sense of fire, Put up, instead, with âthree removes:â Thus, when with any tender words Or tears she spoke about a loss, The dear departed, Mr. Cross, Came in for nothing but his thirds; For, as all widows love too well, She liked upon the list to dwell, And oft ripp'd up the old disasters. She might, indeed, have been suppos'd A great ship owner; for she pros'd Eternally of her Three Masters! Thus, foolish woman! while she nurs'd Her mild souchong, she talk'd and reckon'd What had been left her by her first, And by her last, and by her second. Alas! not all her annual rents Could then entice the little Germanâ Not Mr. Cross's Three Per Cents, Or Consols, ever make him her man: He liked her cash, he liked her houses, But not that dismal bit of land She always settled on her spouses. So taking up his hat and band, Said he, âYou'll think my conduct oddâ But here my hopes no more may linger; I thought you had a wedding-finger, But oh!âit is a curtain-rod!â JOHN TROT A BALLAD John Trot he was as tall a lad As York did ever rearâ As his dear Granny used to say, He'd make a grenadier. A serjeant soon came down to York, With ribbons and a frill; My lads, said he, let broadcast be, And come away to drill. But when he wanted John to 'list, In war he saw no fun, Where what is called a raw recruit Gets often over-done. Let others carry guns, said he, And go to war's alarms, But I have got a shoulder-knot Impos'd upon my arms. For John he had a footman's place To wait on Lady Wyeâ She was a dumpy woman, tho' Her family was high. Now when two years had past away, Her Lord took very ill, And left her to her widowhood, Of course more dumpy still. Said John, I am a proper man, And very tall to see; Who knows, but now her Lord is low, She may look up to me? A cunning woman told me once, Such fortune would turn up; She was a kind of sorceress, But studied in a cup! So he walked up to Lady Wye, And took her quite amaz'd,â She thought, tho' John was tall enough, He wanted to be rais'd. But Johnâfor why? she was a dame Of such a dwarfish sortâ Had only come to bid her make Her mourning very short. Said he, your Lord is dead and cold, You only cry in vain; Not all the Cries of London now Could call him back again! You'll soon have many a noble beau, To dry your noble tearsâ But just consider this, that I Have follow'd you for years. And tho' you are above me far, What matters high degree, When you are only four foot nine, And I am six foot three! For tho' you are of lofty race, And I'm a low-born elf; Yet none among your friends could say, You match'd beneath yourself. Said she, such insolence as this Can be no common case; Tho' you are in my service, sir, Your love is out of place. O Lady Wye! O Lady Wye! Consider what you do; How can you be so short with me, I am not so with you! Then ringing for her serving men, They show'd him to the door: Said they, you turn out better now, Why didn't you before? They stripp'd his coat, and gave him kicks For all his wages due; And off, instead of green and gold, He went in black and blue. No family would take him in, Because of his discharge; So he made up his mind to serve The country all at large. Huzza! the Serjeant cried, and put The money in his hand, And with a shilling cut him off From his paternal land. For when his regiment went to fight At Saragossa town, A Frenchman thought he look'd too tall And so he cut him down! ODE TO THE CAMELEOPARD Welcome to Freedom's birth-placeâand a den! Great Anti-climax, hail! So very lofty in thy frontâbut then, So dwindling at the tail!â In truth, thou hast the most unequal legs: Has one pair gallop'd, whilst the other trotted, Along with other brethren, leopard-spotted, O'er Afric sand, where ostriches lay eggs? Sure thou wert caught in some hard uphill chase, Those hinder heels still keeping thee in check! And yet thou seem'st prepar'd in any case, Tho' they had lost the race, To win itâby a neck! That lengthy neckâhow like a crane's it looks! Art thou the overseer of all the brutes? Or dost thou browze on tip-top leaves or fruitsâ Or go a-bird-nesting amongst the roks? How kindly nature caters for all wants; Thus giving unto thee a neck that stretches, And high food fetchesâ To some a long nose, like the elephant's! Oh! had'st thou any organ to thy bellows, To turn thy breath to speech in human style, What secrets thou might'st tell us, Where now our scientific guesses fail; For instance, of the Nile, Whether those Seven Mouths have any tailâ Mayhap thy luck too, From that high head, as from a lofty hill, Has let thee see the marvellous Timbuctooâ Or drink of Niger at its infant rill; What were the travels of our Major Denham, Or Clapperton, to thine In that same line, If thou could'st only squat thee down and pen 'em! Strange sights, indeed, thou must have overlook'd, With eyes held ever in such vantage-stations! Hast seen, perchance, unhappy white folks cook'd, And then made free of negro corporations? Poor wretches saved from cast away three deckersâ By sooty wreckersâ From hungry waves to have a loss still drearier, To far exceed the utmost aim of Parkâ And find themselves, alas! beyond the mark, In the insides of Africa's Interior! Live on, Giraffe! genteelest of raff kind!â Admir'd by noble and by royal tongues!â May no pernicious wind, Or English fog, blight thy exotic lungs! Live on in happy peace, altho' a rarity, Nor envy thy poor cousin's more outrageous Parisian popularity;â Whose very leopard-rash is grown contagious, And worn on gloves and ribbons all about, Alas! they'll wear him out!â So thou shalt take thy sweet diurnal feedsâ When he is stuff'd with undigested straw, Sad food that never visited his jaw! And staring round him with a brace of beads!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VERSES FROM âTYLNEY HALLâ [PLAY ON, YE TIMID RABBITS] Play on, ye timid Rabbits! For I can see ye run, Ne'er thinking of a gun, Or of the ferret's habits. Ye sportive Hares! go forcing The dewdrop from the bent; My mind is not intent On greyhounds or on coursing. Feed on, ye gorgeous Pheasants! My sight I do not vex With cards about your necks, Forestalling you for presents. Go gazing on, and bounding, Thou solitary Deer! My fancy does not hear Hounds baying, and horns sounding. Each furr'd or feather'd creature, Enjoy with me this earth, Its life, its love, its mirth, And die the death of nature! [A DECLARATION] If to believe that dreams were truth, And all the fond romance of youth; Each pictured charm that fancy prized In one fair form now realizedâ If to sum up in that dear scope My all of joy, my all of hope; Where faithlessness there could be none, For all the sex was merg'd in oneâ If to be happy in her nearness, Holding her very silk in dearness; As if my heart could have no home But where she was, or was to comeâ If from the contact of a finger, An after-bliss for days could linger, A feeling kept secure and chaste Till by the next sweet touch effac'dâ If to pine after pow'r and glory But for one sakeâif in love-story, To make each tenderest phrase refer All that is bright and good to herâ If with all thoughts to haunt her bow'r True as the bee is to the flow'r; Her image join'd with all day-scheming, And nightly worshipped in all dreamingâ If these be signs that Love delivers, I am thy lover, fair Grace Rivers! [THE STREAMLET] Still glides the gentle streamlet on, With shifting current new and strange; The water that was here is gone, But those green shadows do not change. Serene, or ruffled by the storm, On present waves, as on the past, The mirror'd grove retains its form, The self-same trees their semblance cast. The hue each fleeting globule wears, That drop bequeaths it to the next, One picture still the surface bears, To illustrate the murmur'd text. So, love, however time may flow, Fresh hours pursuing those that flee, One constant image still shall show My tide of life is true to thee! TOM TATTERS' BIRTHDAY ODE Come all you jolly dogs, in the Grapes, and King's Head, and Green Man, and Bell taps, And shy up your hatsâif you haven't hats, your paper and woollen caps, Shout with me and cry Eureka! by the sweet Parnassian River, While Echo, in Warner's Wood replies, Huzza! the young Squire for ever! And Vulcan, Mars, and Hector of Troy, and Jupiter and his wife, And Phoebus, from his forked hill, coming down to take a knife, And Mercury, and piping Pan, to the tune of âOld King Cole,â And Venus the Queen of Love, to eat an ox that was roasted whole. Sir Mark, God bless him, loves good old times, when beards wag, and every thing goes merry, There'll be drinking out of gracecups, and a Boar's head chewing rosemary, Maid Marian, and a Morris dance, and acting of quaint Moralities, Doctor Bellamy and a Hobby horse, and many other Old Formalities. But there won't be any Psalm-singing saints, to make us sad of a Monday, But Bacchus will preach to us out of a barrel, instead of the methodist Bundy. We'll drink to the King in good strong ale, like souls that are true and loyal, And a fig for Mrs. Hanway, camomile, sage and penny-royal; And a fig for Master Gregory, that takes tipsy folks into custody, He was a wise man to-morrow, and will be a wiser man yesterday. Come fill a bumper up, my boys, and toss off every drop of it! Here's young Squire Ringwood's health, and may he live as long as Jason, Before Atropos cuts his thread, and Dick Tablet, the bungling mason, Chips him a marble tea-table, with a marble tea-urn a-top of it?

F. Chorley. O! come, all ye who love to hear An ancient song in ancient taste, To whom all bygone Music's dear As verdant spots in Memory's waste! Its name âThe Ancient Concertâ wrongs, And has not hit the proper clef, To wit, Old Folks, to sing Old Songs, To Old Subscribers rather deaf. Away then, Hawes! with all your band! Ye beardless boys, this room desert! One youthful voice, or youthful hand, Our concert-pitch would disconcert! No Bird must join our âvocal throng,â The present age beheld at font: Away, then, all ye âSons of Song,â Your Fathers are the men we want! Away, Miss Birch, you're in your prime! Miss Romer, seek some other door! Go, Mrs. Shaw! till, counting time, You count you're nearly fifty-four! Go, Miss Novello, sadly young! Go, thou composing Chevalier, And roam the county towns among, No Newcome will be welcome here! Our Concert aims to give at night The music that has had its day! So, Rooke, for us you cannot write Till time has made you Raven grey. Your score may charm a modern ear, Nay, ours, when three or fourscore old, But in this Ancient atmosphere, Fresh airs like yours would give us cold! Go, Hawes, and Cawse, and Woodyat, go! Hence, Shirreff, with those native curls; And Master Coward ought to know This is no place for boys and girls! No Massons here we wish to see; Nor is it Mrs. Seguin's sphere, And Mrs. B?! Oh! Mrs. B?, Such Bishops are not reverend here! What! Grisi, bright and beaming thus! To sing the songs gone grey with age! No, Grisi, no,âbut come to us And welcome, when you leave the stage! Off, Ivanhoff!âtill weak and harsh!â Rubini, hence! with all the clan! But come, Lablache, years hence, Lablache, A little shrivell'd thin old man! Go, Mr. Phillips, where you please! Away, Tom Cooke, and all your batch; You'd run us out of breath with Glees, And Catches that we could not catch. Away, ye Leaders all, who lead With violins, quite modern things; To guide our Ancient band we need Old fiddles out of leading strings! But come, ye Songsters, over-ripe, That into âchildish trebles break!â And bring, Miss Winter, bring the pipe That cannot sing without a shake! Nay, come, ye Spinsters all, that spin A slender thread of ancient voice, Old notes that almost seem call'd in; At such as you we shall rejoice! No thund'ring Thalbergs here shall baulk, Or ride your pet D-cadence o'er, But fingers with a little chalk Shall, moderato, keep the score! No Broadwoods here, so full of tone, But Harpsichords assist the strain: No Lincoln's pipes, we have our own Bird-Organ, built by Tubal-Cain. And welcome! St. Cecilians, now Ye willy-nilly, ex-good fellows, Who will strike up, no matter how, With organs that survive their bellows! And bring, O bring, your ancient styles In which our elders lov'd to roam, Those flourishes that strayed for miles, Till some good fiddle led them home! O come, ye ancient London Cries, When Christmas Carols erst were sung! Come, Nurse, who dron'd the lullabies, âWhen Music, heavenly Maid, was young!â No matter how the critics treat, What modern sins and faults detect, The Copy-Book shall still repeat, These Concerts must âCommand respect!â SONNET ON STEAM BY AN UNDER-OSTLER I wish I livd a Thowsen year Ago Wurking for Sober six and Seven milers And dubble Stages runnen safe and slo The Orsis cum in Them days to the Bilers But Now by meens of Powers of Steem forces A-turning Coches into Smoakey Kettels The Bilers seam a Cumming to the Orses And Helps and naggs Will sune be out of Vittels Poor Bruits I wunder How we bee to Liv When sutch a change of Orses is our Faits No nothink need Be sifted in a Siv May them Blowd ingins all Blow up their Grates And Theaves of Oslers crib the Coles and Giv Their blackgard Hannimuls a Feed of Slaits! A REPORT FROM BELOW âBlow high, blow low.â âSea Song. As Mister B. and Mistress B. One night were sitting down to tea, With toast and muffins hotâ They heard a loud and sudden bounce, That made the very china flounce, They could not for a time pronounce If they were safe or shotâ For Memory brought a deed to match At Deptford done by nightâ Before one eye appeared a Patch In t'other eye a Blight! To be belabour'd out of life, Without some small attempt at strife, Our nature will not grovel; One impulse mov'd both man and dame, He seized the tongsâshe did the same, Leaving the ruffian, if he came, The poker and the shovel. Suppose the couple standing so, When rushing footsteps from below Made pulses fast and fervent; And first burst in the frantic cat, All steaming like a brewer's rat, And thenâas white as my cravatâ Poor Mary May, the servant! Lord, how the couple's teeth did chatter, Master and Mistress both flew at her, âSpeak! Fire? or Murder? What's the matter?â Till Mary getting breath, Upon her tale began to touch With rapid tongue, full trotting, such As if she thought she had too much To tell before her death:â âWe was both, Ma'am, in the wash-house, Ma'am, a-standing at our tubs, And Mrs. Round was seconding what little things I rubs; âMary,â says she to me, âI sayââand there she stops for coughin', âThat dratted copper flue has took to smokin' very often, But please the pigs,ââfor that's her way of swearing in a passion, âI'll blow it up, and not be set a coughin' in this fashion!â Well, down she takes my master's hornâI mean his horn for loading, And empties every grain alive for to set the flue exploding. Lawk, Mrs. Round! says I, and stares, that quantum is unproper, I'm sartin sure it can't not take a pound to sky a copper; You'll powder both our heads off, so I tells you, with its puff, But she only dried her fingers, and she takes a pinch of snuff. Well, when the pinch is overââTeach your grandmother to suck A powder horn,â says sheâWell, says I, I wish you luck. Them words sets up her back, so with her hands upon her hips, âCome,â says she, quite in a huff, âcome, keep your tongue inside your lips; Afore ever you was born, I was well used to things like these; I shall put it in the grate, and let it burn up by degrees.â So in it goes, and BounceâO Lord! it gives us such a rattle, I thought we both were cannonized, like Sogers in a battle! Up goes the copper like a squib, and us on both our backs, And bless the tubs, they bundled off, and split all into cracks. Well, there I fainted dead away, and might have been cut shorter, But Providence was kind, and brought me to with scalding water. I first looks round for Mrs. Round, and sees her at a distance, As stiff as starch, and looked as dead as any thing in existence; All scorched and grimed, and more than that, I sees the copper slap Right on her head, for all the world like a percussion copper cap. Well, I crooks her little fingers, and crumps them well up together, As humanity pints out, and burnt her nostrums with a feather; But for all as I can do, to restore her to her mortality, She never gives a sign of a return to sensuality. Thinks I, well there she lies, as dead as my own late departed mother, Well, she'll wash no more in this world, whatever she does in t'other. So I gives myself to scramble up the linens for a minute, Lawk, sich a shirt! thinks I, it's well my master wasn't in it; Oh! I never, never, never, never, never, see a sight so shockin'; Here lays a leg, and there a legâI mean, you know, a stockingâ Bodies all slit and torn to rags, and many a tattered skirt, And arms burnt off, and sides and backs all scotched and black with dirt; But as nobody was in 'emânone butânobody was hurt! Well, there I am, a-scrambling up the things, all in a lump, When, mercy on us! such a groan as makes my heart to jump. And there she is, a-lying with a crazy sort of eye, A-staring at the wash-house roof, laid open to the sky; Then she beckons with a finger, and so down to her I reaches, And puts my ear agin her mouth to hear her dying speeches, For, poor soul! she has a husband and young orphans, as I knew; Well, Ma'am, you wont believe it, but it's Gospel fact and true, But these words is all she whisperedââWhy, where is the powder blew?ââ ODE TO M. BRUNEL âWell said, old mole! canst work i'the earth so fast? a worthy pioneer!â âHamlet. Well!âMonsieur Brunel, How prospers now thy mighty undertaking, To join by a hollow way the Bankside friends Of Rotherhithe, and Wapping,â Never be stopping, But poking, groping, in the dark keep making An archway, underneath the Dabs and Gudgeons, For Collier men and pitchy old Curmudgeons, To cross the water in inverse proportion, Walk under steam-boats under the keel's ridge, To keep down all extortion, And without sculls to diddle London Bridge! In a fresh hunt, a new Great Bore to worry, Thou didst to earth thy human terriers follow, Hopeful at last from Middlesex to Surrey, To give us the âView hollow.â In short it was thy aim, right north and south, To put a pipe into old Thames's mouth; Alas! half-way thou hadst proceeded, when Old Thames, through roof, not water-proof, Came, like âa tide in the affairs of men;â And with a mighty stormy kind of roar, Reproachful of thy wrong, Burst out in that old song Of Incledon's, beginning âCease, rude Boreââ Sad is it, worthy of one's tears, Just when one seems the most successful, To find one's self o'er head and ears In difficulties most distressful! Other great speculations have been nursed, Till want of proceeds laid them on a shelf; But thy concern was at the worst, When it began to liquidate itself! But now Dame Fortune has her false face hidden, And languishes thy Tunnel,âso to paint, Under a slow incurable complaint, Bed-ridden! Why, when thus Thamesâbed-bother'dâwhy repine? Do try a spare bed at the Serpentine! Yet let none think thee daz'd, or craz'd, or stupid; And sunk beneath thy own and Thames's craft; Let them not style thee some Mechanic Cupid Pining and pouting o'er a broken shaft! I'll tell thee with thy tunnel what to do; Light up thy boxes, build a bin or two, The wine does better than such water trades: Stick up a signâthe sign of the Bore's Head; I've drawn it ready for thee in black lead, And make thy cellar subterrane,âThy Shades! OVER THE WAY âI sat over against a window where there stood a pot with very pretty flowers; and I had my eyes fixed on it, when on a sudden the window opened, and a young lady appeared whose beauty struck me.â âArabian Nights. Alas! the flames of an unhappy lover About my heart and on my vitals prey; I've caught a fever that I can't get over, Over the way! Oh! why are eyes of hazel? noses Grecian! I've lost my rest by night, my peace by day, For want of some brown Holland or Venetian, Over the way. I've gazed too often, till my heart's as lost As any needle in a stack of hay: Crosses belong to love, and mine is crossed Over the way! I cannot read or write, or thoughts relaxâ Of what avail Lord Althorp or Earl Grey? They cannot ease me of my window-tax Over the way! Even on Sunday my devotions vary, And from St. Bennet Fink they go astray To dear St. Mary Overyâthe Mary Over the way! Oh! if my godmother were but a fairy, With magic wand, how I would beg and pray That she would change me into that canary Over the way! I envy every thing that's near Miss Lindo, A pug, a poll, a squirrel or a jayâ Blest blue-bottles! that buz about the window Over the way! Even at even, for there be no shutters, I see her reading on, from grave to gay, Some tale or poem, till the candle gutters Over the way! And thenâoh! thenâwhile the clear waxen taper Emits, two stories high, a starlike ray, I see twelve auburn curls put into paper Over the way! But how breathe unto her my deep regards, Or ask her for a whispered ay or nay,â Or offer her my hand, some thirty yards Over the way? Cold as the pole she is to my adoring;â Like Captain Lyon, at Repulse's Bay, I meet an icy end to my exploring Over the way! Each dirty little Savoyard that dances She looks onâPunchâor chimney-sweeps in May; Zounds! wherefore cannot I attract her glances Over the way? Half out she leans to watch a tumbling brat, Or yelping cur, run over by a dray; But I'm in loveâshe never pities that! Over the way! I go to the same churchâa love-lost labour; Haunt all her walks, and dodge her at the play; She does not seem to know she has a neighbour Over the way! At private theatres she never acts; No Crown-and-Anchor balls her fancy sway; She never visits gentlemen with tracts Over the way! To billets-doux by post she shows no favourâ In short, there is no plot that I can lay To break my window-pains to my enslaver Over the way! I play the fluteâshe heeds not my chromaticsâ No friend an introduction can purvey; I wish a fire would break out in the attics Over the way! My wasted form ought of itself to touch her; My baker feels my appetite's decay; And as for butchers' meatâoh! she's my butcher Over the way! At beef I turn; at lamb or veal I pout; I never ring now to bring up the tray; My stomach grumbles at my dining out Over the way! I'm weary of my life; without regret I could resign this miserable clay To lie within that box of mignonette Over the way! I've fitted bullets to my pistol-bore; I've vowed at times to rush where trumpets bray, Quite sick of number oneâand number four Over the way! Sometimes my fancy builds up castles airy, Sometimes it only paints a ferme ornÃ©e, A horseâa cowâsix fowlsâa pigâand Mary, Over the way! Sometimes I dream of her in bridal white, Standing before the altar, like a fay; Sometimes of balls, and neighbourly invite Over the way! I've coo'd with her in dreams, like any turtle, I've snatch'd her from the Clyde, the Tweed, and Tay; Thrice I have made a grove of that one myrtle Over the way! Thrice I have rowed her in a fairy shallop, Thrice raced to Gretna in a neat âpo-shay,â And shower'd crowns to make the horses gallop Over the way! And thrice I've started up from dreams appalling Of killing rivals in a bloody frayâ There is a young man very fond of calling Over the way! Oh! happy manâabove all kings in glory, Whoever in her ear may say his say, And add a tale of love to that one story Over the way! Nabob of ArcotâDespot of Japanâ Sultan of PersiaâEmperor of Cathayâ Much rather would I be the happy man Over the way! With such a lot my heart would be in cloverâ But whatâO horror!âwhat do I survey! Postilions and white favours!âall is over Over the way! A NOCTURNAL SKETCH Even is come; and from the dark Park, hark, The signal of the setting sunâone gun! And six is sounding from the chime, prime time To go and see the Drury-Lane Dane slain,â Or hear Othello's jealous doubt spout out,â Or Macbeth raving at that shade-made blade, Denying to his frantic clutch much touch;â Or else to see Ducrow with wide stride ride Four horses as no other man can span; Or in the small Olympic Pit, sit split Laughing at Liston, while you quiz his phiz. Anon Night comes, and with her wings brings things Such as, with his poetic tongue, Young sung; The gas up-blazes with its bright white light, And paralytic watchmen prowl, howl, growl, About the streets and take up Pall-Mall Sal, Who, hasting to her nightly jobs, robs fobs. Now thieves to enter for your cash, smash, crash, Past drowsy Charley in a deep sleep, creep, But frightened by Policeman B. 3, flee, And while they're going, whisper low, âNo go!â Now puss, while folks are in their beds, treads leads, And sleepers waking, grumbleââDrat that cat!â Who in the gutter caterwauls, squalls, mauls Some feline foe, and screams in shrill ill-will. Now Bulls of Bashan, of a prize size, rise In childish dreams, and with a roar gore poor Georgy, or Charley, or Billy, willy-nilly;â But Nursemaid in a nightmare rest, chest-press'd, Dreameth of one of her old flames, James Games, And that she hearsâwhat faith is man'sâAnn's banns And his, from Reverend Mr. Rice, twice, thrice: White ribbons flourish, and a stout shout out, That upward goes, shows Rose knows those bows' woes! DOMESTIC ASIDES; OR, TRUTH IN PARENTHESES âI really take it very kind, This visit, Mrs. Skinner!

      <field name="fulltext">THE DEVIL'S ALBUM It will seem an odd whim For a Spirit so grim As the Devil to take a delight in; But by common renown He has come up to town, With an Album for people to write in! On a handsomer book Mortal never did look, Of a flame-colour silk is the binding, With a border superb, Where through flowret and herb, The old Serpent goes brilliantly winding! By gilded grotesques, And emboss'd arabesques, The whole cover, in fact, is pervaded; But, alas! in a taste That betrays they were traced At the will of a Spirit degraded! As for paperâthe best, But extremely hot-pressed, Courts the pen to luxuriate upon it, And against ev'ry blank There's a note on the Bank, As a bribe for a sketch or a sonnet. Who will care to appear In the Friend's Souvenir, Is a question to morals most vital; But the very first leaf, It's the public belief, Will be fill'd by a Lady of Title! THE LOST HEIR âO where, and oh where Is my bonny laddie gone?â Old Song. One day, as I was going by That part of Holborn christened High, I heard a loud and sudden cry, That chill'd my very blood; And lo! from out a dirty alley, Where pigs and Irish wont to rally, I saw a crazy woman sally, Bedaub'd with grease and mud. She turn'd her East, she turn'd her West, Staring like Pythoness possesst, With streaming hair and heaving breast, As one stark mad with grief. This way and that she wildly ran, Jostling with woman and with manâ Her right hand held a frying pan, The left a lump of beef. At last her frenzy seem'd to reach A point just capable of speech, And with a tone almost a screech, As wild as ocean bird's, Or female Ranter mov'd to preach, She gave her âsorrow words.â âO Lord! O dear, my heart will break, I shall go stick stark staring wild! Has ever a one seen any thing about the streets like a crying lost-looking child? Lawk help me, I don't know where to look, or to run, if I only knew which wayâ A Child as is lost about London streets, and especially Seven Dials, is a needle in a bottle of hay. I am all in a quiverâget out of my sight, do, you wretch, you little Kitty M'Nab! You promised to have half an eye to him, you know you did, you dirty deceitful young drab. The last time as ever I see him, poor thing, was with my own blessed Motherly eyes, Sitting as good as gold in the gutter, a playing at making little dirt pies. I wonder he left the court where he was better off than all the other young boys, With two bricks, an old shoe, nine oyster-shells, and a dead kitten by way of toys. When his Father comes home, and he always comes home as sure as ever the clock strikes one, He'll be rampant, he will, at his child being lost; and the beef and the inguns not done! La bless you, good folks, mind your own consarns, and don't be making a mob in the street; O serjeant M'Farlane! you have not come across my poor little boy, have you, in your beat? Do, good people, move on! don't stand staring at me like a parcel of stupid stuck pigs; Saints forbid! but he's p'r'aps been inviggled away up a court for the sake of his clothes by the prigs; He'd a very good jacket, for certain, for I bought it myself for a shilling one day in Rag Fair; And his trowsers considering not very much patch'd, and red plush, they was once his Father's best pair. His shirt, it's very lucky I'd got washing in the tub, or that might have gone with the rest; But he'd got on a very good pinafore with only two slits and a burn on the breast. He'd a goodish sort of hat, if the crown was sew'd in, and not quite so much jagg'd at the brim, With one shoe on, and the other shoe is a boot, and not a fit, and, you'll know by that if it's him. Except being so well dress'd, my mind would misgive, some old beggar woman in want of an orphan, Had borrow'd the child to go a begging with, but I'd rather see him laid out in his coffin! Do, good people, move on, such a rabble of boys! I'll break every bone of 'em I come near, Go homeâyou're spilling the porterâgo homeâTommy Jones, go along home with your beer. This day is the sorrowfullest day of my life, ever since my name was Betty Morgan, Them vile Savoyards! they lost him once before all along of following a Monkey and an Organ: O my Billyâmy head will turn right roundâif he's got kiddynapp'd with them Italians, They'll make him a plaster parish image boy, they will, the outlandish tatter-demalions. Billyâwhere are you, Billy?âI'm as hoarse as a crow, with screaming for ye, you young sorrow! And shan't have half a voice, no more I shan't, for crying fresh herrings to-morrow. O Billy, you're bursting my heart in two, and my life won't be of no more vally, If I'm to see other folk's darlins, and none of mine, playing like angels in our alley, And what shall I do but cry out my eyes, when I looks at the old three-legged chair, As Billy used to make coaches and horses of, and there a'n't no Billy there! I would run all the wide world over to find him, if I only know'd where to run, Little Murphy, now I remember, was once lost for a month through stealing a penny bun,â The Lord forbid of any child of mine! I think it would kill me raily, To find my Bill holdin' up his little innocent hand at the Old Bailey. For though I say it as oughtn't, yet I will say, you may search for miles and mileses And not find one better brought up, and more pretty behaved, from one end to t'other of St. Giles's. And if I called him a beauty, it's no lie, but only as a Mother ought to speak; You never set eyes on a more handsomer face, only it hasn't been washed for a week; As for hair, tho' it's red, it's the most nicest hair when I've time to just show it the comb; I'll owe 'em five pounds, and a blessing besides, as will only bring him safe and sound home. He's blue eyes, and not to be call'd a squint, though a little cast he's certainly got; And his nose is still a good un, tho' the bridge is broke, by his falling on a pewter pint pot; He's got the most elegant wide mouth in the world, and very large teeth for his age; And quite as fit as Mrs. Murdockson's child to play Cupid on the Drury Lane Stage. And then he has got such dear winning waysâbut O I never never shall see him no more! O dear! to think of losing him just after nussing him back from death's door! Only the very last month when the windfalls, hang 'em, was at twenty a penny! And the threepence he'd got by grottoing was spent in plums, and sixty for a child is too many. And the Cholera man came and whitewash'd us all and, drat him, made a seize of our hog.â It's no use to send the Crier to cry him about, he's such a blunderin' drunken old dog; The last time he was fetched to find a lost child, he was guzzling with his bell at the Crown, And went and cried a boy instead of a girl, for a distracted Mother and Father about Town. Billyâwhere are you, Billy, I say? come, Billy, come home, to your best of Mothers! I'm scared when I think of them Cabroleys, they drive so, they'd run over their own Sisters and Brothers. Or may be he's stole by some chimbly sweeping wretch, to stick fast in narrow flues and what not, And be poked up behind with a picked pointed pole, when the soot has ketch'd, and the chimbly's red hot. Oh I'd give the whole wide world, if the world was mine, to clap my two longin' eyes on his face, For he's my darlin of darlins, and if he don't soon come back, you'll see me drop stone dead on the place. I only wish I'd got him safe in these two Motherly arms, and wouldn't I hug him and kiss him! Lauk! I never knew what a precious he wasâbut a child don't not feel like a child till you miss him. Why, there he is! Punch and Judy hunting, the young wretch, it's that Billy as sartin as sin! But let me get him home, with a good grip of his hair, and I'm blest if he shall have a whole bone in his skin! JOHN DAY A PATHETIC BALLAD âA Day after the Fair.â âOld Proverb. John Day he was the biggest man Of all the coachman-kind, With back too broad to be conceiv'd By any narrow mind. The very horses knew his weight When he was in the rear, And wish'd his box a Christmas-box To come but once a year. Alas! against the shafts of love What armour can avail? Soon Cupid sent an arrow through His scarlet coat of mail. The bar-maid of the Crown he lov'd, From whom he never ranged, For tho' he changed his horses there, His love he never changed. He thought her fairest of all fares, So fondly love prefers; And often, among twelve outsides, Deemed no outside like hers. One day as she was sitting down Beside the porter-pumpâ He came, and knelt with all his fat, And made an offer plump. Said she, my taste will never learn To like so huge a man, So I must beg you will come here As little as you can. But still he stoutly urged his suit, With vows, and sighs, and tears, Yet could not pierce her heart, altho' He drove the Dart for years. In vain he wooed, in vain he sued; The maid was cold and proud, And sent him off to Coventry, While on his way to Stroud. He fretted all the way to Stroud, And thence all back to town, The course of love was never smooth, So his went up and down. At last her coldness made him pine To merely bones and skin; But still he loved like one resolved To love through thick and thin. Oh Mary, view my wasted back, And see my dwindled calf; Tho' I have never had a wife, I've lost my better half. Alas, in vain he still assail'd, Her heart withstood the dint; Though he had carried sixteen stone He could not move a flint. Worn out, at last he made a vow To break his being's link; For he was so reduced in size At nothing he could shrink. Now some will talk in water's praise, And waste a deal of breath, But John, tho' he drank nothing elseâ He drank himself to death. The cruel maid that caused his love, Found out the fatal close, For looking in the butt, she saw, The butt-end of his woes. Some say his spirit haunts the Crown, But that is only talkâ For after riding all his life, His ghost objects to walk. NUMBER ONE VERSIFIED FROM THE PROSE OF A YOUNG LADY It's very hard!âand so it is, To live in such a row,â And witness this that every Miss But me, has got a Beau.â For Love goes calling up and down, But here he seems to shun; I'm sure he has been asked enough To call at Number One! I'm sick of all the double knocks That come to Number Four!â At Number Three, I often see A Lover at the door;â And one in blue, at Number Two, Calls daily like a dun,â It's very hard they come so near And not to Number One! Miss Bell I hear has got a dear Exactly to her mind,â By sitting at the window pane Without a bit of blind; But I go in the balcony, Which she has never done, Yet arts that thrive at Number Five Don't take at Number One! 'Tis hard with plenty in the street, And plenty passing by,â There's nice young men at Number Ten, But only rather shy;â And Mrs. Smith across the way Has got a grown-up son, But la! he hardly seems to know There is a Number One! There's Mr. Wick at Number Nine, But he's intent on pelf, And though he's pious will not love His neighbour as himself.â At Number Seven there was a saleâ The goods had quite a run! And here I've got my single lot On hand at Number One! My mother often sits at work And talks of props and stays, And what a comfort I shall be In her declining days:â The very maids about the house Have set me down a nun, The sweethearts all belong to them That call at Number One. Once only when the flue took fire, One Friday afternoon, Young Mr. Long came kindly in And told me not to swoon:â Why can't he come again without The PhÅnix and the Sun!â We cannot always have a flue On fire at Number One! I am not old! I am not plain! Nor awkward in my gaitâ I am not crooked like the bride That went from Number Eight:â I'm sure white satin made her look As brown as any bunâ But even beauty has no chance, I think, at Number One! At Number Six they say Miss Rose Has slain a score of hearts, And Cupid, for her sake, has been Quite prodigal of darts. The Imp they show with bended bow, I wish he had a gun!â But if he had, he'd never deign To shoot with Number One! It's very hard, and so it is To live in such a row! And here's a ballad singer come To aggravate my woe;â O take away your foolish song, And tones enough to stunâ There is âNae luck about the house,â I know, at Number One! THE DROWNING DUCKS Amongst the sights that Mrs. Bond Enjoy'd yet grieved at more than others, Were little ducklings in a pond, Swimming about beside their mothersâ Small things like living waterlilies, But yellow as the daffo-dillies. âIt's very hard,â she used to moan, âThat other people have their ducklings To grace their watersâmine alone Have never any pretty chucklings.â For why!âeach little yellow navy Went downâall downyâto old Davy! She had a lakeâa pond I meanâ Its wave was rather thick than pearlyâ She had two ducks, their napes were greenâ She had a drake, his tail was curly,â Yet spite of drake, and ducks, and pond, No little ducks had Mrs. Bond! The birds were both the best of mothersâ The nest had eggsâthe eggs had luckâ The infant D.'s came forth like othersâ But there, alas! the matter stuck! They might as well have all died addle, As die when they began to paddle! For when, as native instinct taught her, The mother set her brood afloat, They sank ere long right under water, Like any over-loaded boat; They were web-footed too to see, As ducks and spiders ought to be! No peccant humour in a gander Brought havoc on her little folks,â No poaching cookâa frying pander To appetite,âdestroyed their yolks,â Beneath her very eyes, Od rot 'em! They went, like plummets, to the bottom. The thing was strangeâa contradiction It seem'd of nature and her works! For little ducks, beyond conviction, Should float without the help of corks: Great Johnson it bewildered him! To hear of ducks that could not swim. Poor Mrs. Bond! what could she do But change the breedâand she tried divers Which dived as all seemed born to do; No little ones were e'er survivorsâ Like those that copy gems, I'm thinking, They all were given to die-sinking! In vain their downy coats were shorn; They flounder'd still!âBatch after batch went! The little fools seem'd only born And hatch'd for nothing but a hatchment! Whene'er they launchedâO sight of wonder! Like fires the water âgot them under!â No woman ever gave their lucks A better chance than Mrs. Bond did; At last quite out of heart and ducks, She gave her pond up, and desponded; For Death among the water-lilies, Cried âDuc ad meâ to all her dillies! But though resolved to breed no more, She brooded often on this riddleâ Alas! 'twas darker than before! At last about the summer's middle, What Johnson, Mrs. Bond, or none did, To clear the matter up the Sun did! The thirsty Sirius, dog-like drank So deep, his furious tongue to cool, The shallow waters sank and sank, And lo, from out the wasted pool, Too hot to hold them any longer, There crawl'd some eels as big as conger! I wish all folks would look a bit, In such a case below the surface; But when the eels were caught and split By Mrs. Bond, just think of her face, In each inside at once to spy A duckling turn'd to giblet-pie! The sight at once explained the case, Making the Dame look rather silly, The tenants of that Eely Place Had found the way to Pick a dilly, And so by under-water suction, Had wrought the little ducks' abduction. SALLY SIMPKIN'S LAMENT OR, JOHN JONES'S KIT-CAT-ASTROPHE âHe left his body to the sea, And made a shark his legatee.â Bryan and Perenne. âOh! what is that comes gliding in, And quite in middling haste? It is the picture of my Jones, And painted to the waist. âIt is not painted to the life, For where's the trowsers blue? Oh Jones, my dear!âOh dear! my Jones, What is become of you?â âOh! Sally dear, it is too true,â The half that you remark Is come to say my other half Is bit off by a shark! âOh! Sally, sharks do things by halves, Yet most completely do! A bite in one place seems enough, But I've been bit in two. âYou know I once was all your own, But now a shark must share! But let that passâfor now to you I'm neither here nor there. âAlas! death has a strange divorce Effected in the sea, It has divided me from you, And even me from me! âDon't fear my ghost will walk o'nights To haunt as people say; My ghost can't walk, for, oh! my legs Are many leagues away! âLord! think when I am swimming round, And looking where the boat is, A shark just snaps away a half, Without âa quarter's notice.â âOne half is here, the other half Is near Columbia placed; Oh! Sally, I have got the whole Atlantic for my waist. âBut now, adieuâa long adieu! I've solved death's awful riddle, And would say more, but I am doomed To break off in the middle.â THE FALL âDown, down, down, ten thousand fathoms deep.â âCount Fathom. Who does not know that dreadful gulf, where Niagara falls, Where eagle unto eagle screams, to vulture vulture calls; Where down beneath, Despair and Death in liquid darkness grope, And upward, on the foam there shines a rainbow without Hope; While, hung with clouds of Fear and Doubt, the unreturning wave Suddenly gives an awful plunge, like life into the grave; And many a hapless mortal there hath dived to bale or bliss; Oneâonly oneâhath ever lived to rise from that abyss! Oh, Heav'n! it turns me now to ice, with chill of fear extreme, To think of my frail bark adrift on that tumultuous stream! In vain with desperate sinews, strung by love of life and light, I urged that coffin, my canoe, against the current's might: Onâonâstill onâdirect for doom, the river rush'd in force, And fearfully the stream of Time raced with it in its course. My eyes I closedâI dared not look the way towards the goal; But still I view'd the horrid close, and dreamt it in my soul. Plainly, as through transparent lids, I saw the fleeting shore, And lofty trees, like winged things, flit by for evermore; Plainly,âbut with no prophet senseâI heard the sullen sound, The torrent's voiceâand felt the mist, like death-sweat gathering round. O agony! O life! My home! and those that made it sweet: Ere I could pray, the torrent lay beneath my very feet. With frightful whirl, more swift than thought, I passed the dizzy edge, Bound after bound, with hideous bruise, I dashed from ledge to ledge, From crag to crag,âin speechless pain,âfrom midnight deep to deep; I did not die,âbut anguish stunn'd my senses into sleep. How long entranced, or whither dived, no clue I have to find: At last the gradual light of life came dawning o'er my mind; And through my brain there thrill'd a cry,âa cry as shrill as birds' Of vulture or of eagle kind, but this was set to words:â âIt's Edgar Huntley in his cap and nightgown, I declares! He's been a walking in his sleep, and pitch'd all down the stairs!â SONNET Along the Woodford road there comes a noise Of wheels, and Mr. Rounding's neat postchaise Struggles along, drawn by a pair of bays, With Rev. Mr. Crow and six small Boys; Who ever and anon declare their joys, With trumping horns and juvenile huzzas, At going home to spend their Christmas days, And changing Learning's pains for Pleasure's toys. Six weeks elapse, and down the Woodford way, A heavy coach drags six more heavy souls, But no glad urchins shout, no trumpets bray; The carriage makes a halt, the gate-bell tolls, And little Boys walk in as dull and mum As six new scholars to the Deaf and Dumb. THE STEAM SERVICE âLife is but a kittle cast.â âBurns. I I steamed from the Downs in the Nancy, My jib how she smoked through the breeze; She's a vessel as tight to my fancy As ever boil'd through the salt seas. When up the flue the sailor goes And ventures on the pot, The landsman, he no better knows, But thinks hard is his lot. Bold Jack with smiles each danger meets, Weighs anchor, lights the log; Trims up the fire, picks out the slates, And drinks his can of grog. Go patter to lubbers and swabs do you see, 'Bout danger, and fear, and the like; But a Boulton and Watt and good Wall's-end give me; And it an't to a little I'll strike. Though the tempest our chimney smack smooth shall down smite, And shiver each bundle of wood; Clear the wreck, stir the fire, and stow every thing tight, And boiling a gallop we'll scud. II Hark, the boatswain hoarsely bawling, By shovel, tongs, and poker, stand; Down the scuttle quick be hauling, Down your bellows, hand, boys, hand. Now it freshens,âblow like blazes; Now unto the coal-hole go; Stir, boys, stir, don't mind black faces, Up your ashes nimbly throw. Ply your bellows, raise the wind, boys; See the valve is clear of course; Let the paddles spin, don't mind, boys, Though the weather should be worse. Fore and aft a proper draft get, Oil the engines, see all clear; Hands up, each a sack of coal get, Man the boiler, cheer, lads, cheer. Now the dreadful thunder's roaring, Peal on peal contending clash; On our heads fierce rain falls pouring, In our eyes the paddles splash. One wide water all around us, All above one smoke-black sky: Different deaths at once surround us; Hark! what means that dreadful cry. The funnel's gone! cries ev'ry tongue out; The engineer's washed off the deck; A leak beneath the coal-hole's sprung out, Call all hands to clear the wreck. Quick, some coal, some nubbly pieces; Come, my hearts, be stout and bold; Plumb the boiler, speed decreases, Four feet water getting cold. While o'er the ship wild waves are beating, We for wives or children mourn; Alas! from hence there's no retreating; Alas! to them there's no return. The fire is outâwe've burst the bellows, The tinder-box is swamped below; Heaven have mercy on poor fellows, For only that can serve us now! A LAY OF REAL LIFE âSome are born with a wooden spoon in their mouths, and some with a golden ladle.â âGoldsmith. âSome are born with tin rings in their noses, and some with silver ones.â âSilversmith. Who ruined me ere I was born, Sold every acre, grass or corn, And left the next heir all forlorn? My Grandfather. Who said my mother was no nurse, And physicked me and made me worse, Till infancy became a curse? My Grandmother. Who left me in my seventh year, A comfort to my mother dear, And Mr. Pope, the overseer? My Father. Who let me starve, to buy her gin, Till all my bones came through my skin, Then called me âugly little sin?â My Mother. Who said my mother was a Turk, And took me homeâand made me work, But managed half my meals to shirk? My Aunt. Who âof all earthly thingsâ would boast, âHe hated others' brats the most,â And therefore made me feel my post? My Uncle. Who got in scrapes, an endless score, And always laid them at my door, Till many a bitter pang I bore? My Cousin. Who took me home when mother died, Again with father to reside, Black shoes, clean knives, run far and wide? My Stepmother. Who marred my stealthy urchin joys, And when I played cried âWhat a noise!ââ Girls always hector over boysâ My Sister. Who used to share in what was mine, Or took it all, did he incline, 'Cause I was eight, and he was nine? My Brother. Who stroked my head, and said âGood lad,â And gave me sixpence, âall he had;â But at the stall the coin was bad? My Godfather. Who, gratis, shared my social glass, But when misfortune came to pass, Referr'd me to the pump? Alas! My Friend. Through all this weary world, in brief, Who ever sympathized with grief, Or shared my joyâmy sole relief? Myself. A VALENTINE THE WEATHER. TO P. MURPHY, ESQ., M.N.S. âThese, properly speaking, being esteemed the three arms of Meteoric action.â Dear Murphy, to improve her charms, Your servant humbly begs; She thanks you for her leash of arms, But wants a brace of legs. Moreover, as you promise folks, On certain days a drizzle; She thinks, in case she cannot rain, She should have means to mizzle. Some lightning too may just fall due, When woods begin to moult; And if she cannot âfork it out,â She'll wish to make a bolt! POEM,âFROM THE POLISH Some months since a young lady was much surprised at receiving, from the Captain of a Whaler a blank sheet of paper, folded in the form of a letter, and duly sealed. At last, recollecting the nature of sympathetic ink, she placed the missive on a toasting-fork, and after holding it to the fire for a minute or two, succeeded in thawing out the following verses. From seventy-two North latitude, Dear Kitty, I indite; But first I'd have you understand How hard it is to write. Of thoughts that breathe and words that burn, My Kitty, do not think,â Before I wrote these very lines, I had to melt my ink. Of mutual flames and lover's warmth, You must not be too nice; The sheet that I am writing on Was once a sheet of ice! The Polar cold is sharp enough To freeze with icy gloss The genial current of the soul, E'en in a âMan of Ross.â Pope says that letters waft a sigh From Indus to the Pole; But here I really wish the post Would only âpost the coal.â So chilly is the Northern blast, It blows me through and through; A ton of Wallsend in a note Would be a billet-doux. In such a frigid latitude It scarce can be a sin, Should Passion cool a little, where A Fury was iced in. I'm rather tired of endless snow, And long for coals again; And would give up a Sea of Ice For some of Lambton's Main. I'm sick of dazzling ice and snow, The sun itself I hate; So very bright, so very cold, Just like a summer grate. For opodeldoc I would kneel, My chilblains to anoint; O Kate, the needle of the north Has got a freezing point. Our food is solidsâere we put Our meat into our crops, We take sledge-hammers to our steaks And hatchets to our chops. So very bitter is the blast, So cutting is the air, I never have been warm but once, When hugging with a bear. One thing I know you'll like to hear, Th'effect of Polar snows, I've left off snuffâone pinching dayâ From leaving off my nose. I have no ear for music now; My ears both left together; And as for dancing, I have cut My toesâit's cutting weather. I've said that you should have my hand, Some happy day to come; But, Kate, you only now can wed A finger and a thumb. Don't fear that any Esquimaux Can wean me from my own; The Girdle of the Queen of Love Is not the Frozen Zone. At wives with large estates of snow My fancy does not bite; I like to see a Brideâbut not In such a deal of white. Give me for home a house of brick, The Kate I love at Kew! A hand unchopped,âa merry eye, And not a nose, of blue! To think upon the Bridge of Kew, To me a bridge of sighs; Oh, Kate, a pair of icicles Are standing in my eyes! God knows if I shall e'er return, In comfort to be lull'd; But if I do get back to port, Pray let me have it mull'd. CONVEYANCING O, London is the place for all, In love with loco-motion! Still to and fro the people go Like billows of the ocean; Machine or man, or caravan, Can all be had for paying, When great estates, or heavy weights, Or bodies want conveying. There's always hacks about in packs, Wherein you may be shaken, And Jarvis is not always drunk, Tho' always overtaken; In racing tricks he'll never mix, His nags are in their last days, And slow to go, altho' they show As if they had their fast days! Then if you like a single horse, This age is quite a cab-age, A car not quite so small and light As those of our Queen Mab age; The horses have been broken well, All danger is rescinded, For some have broken both their knees, And some are broken winded. If you've a friend at Chelsea end, The stages are worth knowingâ There is a sort, we call 'em short, Although the longest goingâ For some will stop at Hatchett's shop, Till you grow faint and sicky, Perched up behind, at last to find, Your dinner is all dickey! Long stages run from every yard: But if you're wise and frugal, You'll never go with any Guard That plays upon the bugle, âYe banks and braes,â and other lays, And ditties everlasting, Like miners going all your way, With boring and with blasting. Instead of journeys, people now May go upon a Gurney, With steam to do the horse's work, By powers of attorney; Tho' with a load it may explode, And you may all be un-done! And find you're going up to Heav'n, Instead of up to London! To speak of every kind of coach, It is not my intention; But there is still one vehicle Deserves a little mention; The world a sage has call'd a stage, With all its living lumber, And Malthus swears it always bears Above the proper number. The law will transfer house or land For ever and a day hence, For lighter things, watch, brooches, rings, You'll never want conveyance; Ho! stop the thief! my handkerchief! It is no sight for laughterâ Away it goes, and leaves my nose To join in running after! SONNET AllegoryâA moral vehicle. âDictionary. I had a Gig-Horse, and I called him Pleasure, Because on Sundays, for a little jaunt, He was so fast and showy, quite a treasure; Although he sometimes kicked and shied aslant. I had a Chaise, and christen'd it Enjoyment, With yellow body, and the wheels of red, Because 'twas only used for one employment, Namely, to go wherever Pleasure led. I had a wife, her nickname was Delight; A son called Frolic, who was never still: Alas! how often dark succeeds to bright! Delight was thrown, and Frolic had a spill, Enjoyment was upset and shattered quite, And Pleasure fell a splitter on Paine's Hill! EPICUREAN REMINISCENCES OF A SENTIMENTALIST âMy Tables! Meat it is, I set it down!â âHamlet. I think it was Springâbut not certain I amâ When my passion began first to work; But I know we were certainly looking for lamb, And the season was over for pork. 'Twas at Christmas, I think, when I met with Miss Chase, Yes,âfor Morris had asked me to dine,â And I thought I had never beheld such a face, Or so noble a turkey and chine. Placed close by her side, it made others quite wild, With sheer envy to witness my luck; How she blushed as I gave her some turtle, and smil'd As I afterwards offered some duck. I looked and I languished, alas, to my cost, Through three courses of dishes and meats; Getting deeper in loveâbut my heart was quite lost, When it came to the trifle and sweets! With a rent-roll that told of my houses and land, To her parents I told my designsâ And then to herself I presented my hand, With a very fine pottle of pines! I asked her to have me for weal or for woe, And she did not object in the least;â I can't tell the dateâbut we married, I know, Just in time to have game at the feast. We went toâit certainly was the seaside; For the next, the most blessed of morns, I remember how fondly I gazed at my bride, Sitting down to a plateful of prawns. O never may mem'ry lose sight of that year, But still hallow the time as it ought, That season the âgrassâ was remarkably dear, And the peas at a guinea a quart. So happy, like hours, all our days seem'd to haste, A fond pair, such as poets have drawn, So united in heartâso congenial in taste, We were both of us partial to brawn! A long life I looked for of bliss with my bride, But then DeathâI ne'er dreamt about that! Oh there's nothing is certain in life, as I cried, When my turbot eloped with the cat! My dearest took ill at the turn of the year, But the cause no physician could nab; But something it seemed like consumption, I fear, It was just after supping on crab. In vain she was doctor'd, in vain she was dosed, Still her strength and her appetite pined; She lost relish for what she had relish'd the most, Even salmon she deeply declin'd. For months still I linger'd in hope and in doubt, While her form it grew wasted and thin; But the last dying spark of existence went out, As the oysters were just coming in! She died, and she left me the saddest of men To indulge in a widower's moan, Oh, I felt all the power of solitude then, As I ate my first natives alone! But when I beheld Virtue's friends in their cloaks, And with sorrowful crape on their hats, O my grief poured a flood! and the out-of-doors folks Were all cryingâI think it was sprats! I'M NOT A SINGLE MAN âDouble, single, and the rub.â âHoyle. âThis, this is Solitude.â âByron. I Well, I confess, I did not guess A simple marriage vow Would make me find all womenkind Such unkind women now! They need not, sure, as distant be As Java or Japan,â Yet every Miss reminds me thisâ I'm not a single man! II Once they made choice of my bass voice To share in each duett; So well I danced, I somehow chanced To stand in every set: They now declare I cannot sing, And dance on Bruin's plan; Me draw!âme paint!âme any thing!â I'm not a single man! III Once I was asked advice, and task'd What works to buy or not, And âwould I read that passage out I so admired in Scott?â They then could bear to hear one read; But if I now began, How they would snub, âMy pretty page,â I'm not a single man! IV One used to stitch a collar then, Another hemmed a frill; I had more purses netted then Than I could hope to fill. I once could get a button on, But now I never canâ My buttons then were Bachelor's,â I'm not a single man! V Oh how they hated politics Thrust on me by papa: But now my chatâthey all leave that To entertain mamma. Mamma, who praises her own self, Instead of Jane or Ann, And lays âher girlsâ upon the shelfâ I'm not a single man! VI Ah me, how strange it is the change, In parlour and in hall, They treat me so, if I but go To make a morning call. If they had hair in papers once, Bolt up the stairs they ran; They now sit still in dishabilleâ I'm not a single man! VII Miss Mary Bond was once so fond Of Romans and of Greeks; She daily sought my cabinet, To study my antiques. Well, now she doesn't care a dump For ancient pot or pan, Her taste at once is modernizedâ I'm not a single man! VIII My spouse is fond of homely life, And all that sort of thing; I go to balls without my wife, And never wear a ring: And yet each Miss to whom I come, As strange as Genghis Khan, Knows by some sign, I can't divine,â I'm not a single man! IX Go where I will, I but intrude, I'm left in crowded rooms, Like Zimmerman on Solitude, Or Hervey at his Tombs. From head to heel, they make me feel, Of quite another clan; Compelled to own, though left alone, I'm not a single man! X Miss Towne the toast, though she can boast A nose of Roman line, Will turn up even that in scorn Of compliments of mine: She should have seen that I have been Her sex's partisan, And really married all I couldâ I'm not a single man! XI 'Tis hard to see how others fare, Whilst I rejected stand,â Will no one take my arm because They cannot have my hand? Miss Parry, that for some would go A trip to Hindostan, With me don't care to mount a stairâ I'm not a single man! XII Some change, of course, should be in force, But, surely, not so muchâ There may be hands I may not squeeze, But must I never touch?â Must I forbear to hand a chair And not pick up a fan? But I have been myself picked upâ I'm not a single man! XIII Others may hint a lady's tint Is purest red and whiteâ May say her eyes are like the skies, So very blue and bright,â I must not say that she has eyes, Or if I so began, I have my fears about my ears,â I'm not a single man! XIV I must confess I did not guess A simple marriage vow, Would make me find all womenkind Such unkind women now; I might be hash'd to death, or smash'd, By Mr. Pickford's van, Without, I fear, a single tearâ I'm not a single man! THE BURNING OF THE LOVE-LETTER âSometimes they were put to the proof, by what was called the Fiery Ordeal.â âHist. Eng. No morning ever seemed so long!â I tried to read with all my might! In my left hand âMy Landlord's Tales,â And threepence ready in my right. 'Twas twelve at lastâmy heart beat high!â The Postman rattled at the door!â And just upon her road to church, I dropt the âBride of Lammermoor!â I seized the noteâI flew upstairsâ Flung-to the door, and lock'd me inâ With panting haste I tore the sealâ And kiss'd the B in Benjamin! 'Twas full of loveâto rhyme with doveâ And all that tender sort of thingâ Of sweet and meetâand heart and dartâ But not a word about a ring!â In doubt I cast it in the flame, And stood to watch the latest sparkâ And saw the love all end in smokeâ Without a Parson and a Clerk! THE APPARITION In the dead of the night, when, from beds that are turfy, The spirits rise up on old cronies to call, Came a shade from the Shades on a visit to Murphy, Who had not foreseen such a visit at all. âDon't shiver and shake,â said the mild Apparition, âI'm come to your bed with no evil design; I'm the Spirit of Moore, Francis Moore the Physician, Once great like yourself in the Almanack line. Like you I was once a great prophet on weather, And deem'd to possess a more prescient knack Than dogs, frogs, pigs, cattle, or cats, all together, The donkeys that bray, and the dillies that quack. With joy, then, as ashes retain former passion, I saw my old mantle lugg'd out from the shelf, Turn'd, trimmed, and brush'd up, and again brought in fashion, I seem'd to be almost reviving myself! But, oh! from my joys there was soon a sad cantleâ As too many cooks make a mull of the brothâ To find that two Prophets were under my mantle, And pulling two ways at the risk of the cloth. Unless you would meet with an awkwardish tumble, Oh! join like the Siamese twins in your jumps; Just fancy if Faith on her Prophets should stumble, The one in his clogs, and the other in pumps! But think how the people would worship and wonder, To find you âhail fellows, well met,â in your hail, In one tune with your rain, and your wind, and your thunder, â'Fore God,â they would cry, âthey are both in a tale!â Consider the hint. LITTLE O'P.âAN AFRICAN FACT It was July the First, and the great hill of Howth Was bearing by compass sow-west and by south, And the name of the ship was the Peggy of Cork, Well freighted with bacon and butter and pork. Now, this ship had a captain, Macmorris by name, And little O'Patrick was mate of the same; For Bristol they sail'd, but by nautical scope, They contrived to be lost by the Cape of Good Hope. Of all the Cork boys that the vessel could boast, Only little O'P. made a swim to the coast; And when he revived from a sort of a trance, He saw a big Black with a very long lance. Says the savage, says he, in some Hottentot tongue, âBash Kuku my gimmel bo gumborry bung!â Then blew a long shell, to the fright of our elf, And down came a hundred as black as himself. They brought with them guattul, and pieces of klam, The first was like beef, and the second like lamb; âDon't I know,â said O'P., what the wretches are at? âThey're intending to eat me as soon as I'm fat!â In terror of coming to pan, spit, or pot, His rations of jarbul he suffer'd to rot; He would not touch purry or doolberry-lik, But kept himself growing as thin as a stick. Though broiling the climate, and parching with drouth, He would not let chobbery enter his mouth, But kick'd down the krug shell, tho' sweeten'd with natt,â âI an't to be pison'd the likes of a rat!â At last the great Joddry got quite in a rage, And cried, âO mi pitticum dambally nage! The chobbery take, and put back on the shelf, Or give me the krug shell, I'll drink it myself! The doolberry-lik is the best to be had, And the purry (I chew'd it myself) is not bad; The jarbul is fresh, for I saw it cut out, And the Bok that it came from is grazing about. My jumbo! but run off to Billery Nang, And tell her to put on her jigger and tang, And go with the Bloss to the man of the sea, And say that she comes as his Wulwul from me.â Now Billery Nang was as Black as a sweep, With thick curly hair like the wool of a sheep, And the moment he spied her, said little O'P., âSure the Divil is dead, and his Widow's at me! But when, in the blaze of her Hottentot charms, She came to accept him for life in her arms, And stretch'd her thick lips to a broad grin of love, A Raven preparing to bill like a Dove, With a soul full of dread he declined the grim bliss, Stopped her Molyneux arms, and eluded her kiss; At last, fairly foiled, she gave up the attack, And Joddry began to look blacker than black; âBy Mumbo! by Jumbo!âwhy here is a man, That won't be made happy do all that I can; He will not be married, lodged, clad, and well fed, Let the Rham take his shangwang and chop off his head!â THE ANGLER'S FAREWELL âResign'd, I kissed the rod.â Well! I think it is time to put up! For it does not accord with my notions, Wrist, elbow, and chine, Stiff from throwing the line, To take nothing at last by my motions! I ground-bait my way as I go, And dip in at each watery dimple: But however I wish To inveigle the fish, To my gentle they will not play simple! Though my float goes so swimmingly on, My bad luck never seems to diminish; It would seem that the Bream Must be scarce in the stream, And the Chub, tho' it's chubby, be thinnish! Not a Trout there can be in the place, Not a Grayling or Rud worth the mention, And although at my hook With attention I look, I can ne'er see my hook with a Tench on! At a brandling once Gudgeon would gape, But they seem upon different terms now; Have they taken advice Of the âCouncil of Nice,â And rejected their âDiet of Worms,â now? In vain my live minnow I spin, Not a Pike seems to think it worth snatching; For the gut I have brought, I had better have bought A good rope that was used to Jackketching! Not a nibble has ruffled my cork, It is vain in this river to search then; I may wait till it's night, Without any bite, And at roost-time have never a Perch then! No Roach can I meet withâno Bleak, Save what in the air is so sharp now; Not a Dace have I got, And I fear it is not âCarpe diem,â a day for the Carp now! Oh! there is not a one-pound prize To be got in this fresh-water lottery! What then can I deem Of so fishless a stream But that 'tisâlike St. Mary'sâOttery! For an Eel I have learn'd how to try, By a method of Walton's own showing,â But a fisherman feels Little prospect of Eels, In a path that's devoted to towing! I have tried all the water for miles, Till I'm weary of dipping and casting, And hungry and faint,â Let the Fancy just paint What it is, without Fish, to be Fasting! And the rain drizzles down very fast, While my dinner-time sounds from a far bell,â So, wet to the skin, I'll e'en back to my Inn, Where at least I am sure of a Bar-bell! SEA SONG AFTER DIBDIN Pure water it plays a good part in The swabbing the decks and all thatâ And it finds its own level for sartinâ For it sartinly drinks very flat:â For my part a drop of the creatur I never could think was a fault, For if Tars should swig water by natur, The sea would have never been salt!â Then off with it into a jorum And make it strong, sharpish, or sweet, For if I've any sense of decorum, It never was meant to be neat!â One day when I was but half sober,â Half measures I always disdainâ I walk'd into a shop that sold Soda, And ax'd for some Water Champagne:â Well, the lubber he drew and he drew, boys, Till I'd shipped my six bottles or more, And blow off my last limb but it's true, boys, Why, I warn't half so drunk as afore!â Then off with it into a jorum, And make it strong, sharpish, or sweet, For if I've any sense of decorum, It never was meant to be neat. STANZAS ON COMING OF AGE âTwiddle'em, Twaddle'em, Twenty-one.ââNurse. O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day! Most lamentable day! most woeful day! That ever, ever, I did yet behold! O day! O day! O day! O hateful day! Never was seen so black a day as this! O woeful day! O woeful day!Musician. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah! put up, put up! For well you know this is a pitiful case.â Romeo and Juliet. To-day it is my natal day, Three 'prenticeships have past away, A part in work, a part in play, Since I was bound to life! This first of May I come of age, A man, I enter on the stage Where human passions fret and rage, To mingle in the strife. It ought to be a happy date, My friends, they all congratulate That I am come to âMan's Estate,â To some, a grand event; But ah! to me descent allots No acres, no paternal spots In Beds, Bucks, Herts, Wilts, Essex, Notts, Hants, Oxon, Berks, or Kent. From John o'Groat's to Land's End search, I have not one rod, pole, or perch, To pay my rent, or tithe to church, That I can call my own. Not common-right for goose or ass; Then what is Man's Estate? Alas! Six feet by two of mould and grass When I am dust and bone. Reserve the feast! The board forsake! Ne'er tap the wineâdon't cut the cake, No toasts or foolish speeches make, At which my reason spurns. Before this happy term you praise, And prate about returns and days, Just o'er my vacant rent-roll gaze, And sum up my returns. I know where great estates descend That here is Boyhood's legal end, And easily can comprehend How âManors make the Man.â But as for me, I was not born To quit-rent of a peppercorn, And gain no ground this blessed morn From Beersheba to Dan. No barrels broachâno bonfires make! To roast a bullock for my sake, Who in the country have no stake, Would be too like a quiz; No banners hoistâlet off no gunâ Pitch no marqueeâdevise no funâ But think when man is Twenty-One What new delights are his! What is the moral legal factâ Of age to-day, I'm free to act For selfâfree, namely, to contract Engagements, bonds, and debts; I'm free to give my I O U, Sign, draw, accept, as majors do; And free to lose my freedom too For want of due assets. I am of age, to ask Miss Ball, Or that great heiress, Miss Duval, To go to church, hump, squint, and all, And be my own for life. But put such reasons on their shelves, To tell the truth between ourselves, I'm one of those contented elves Who do not want a wife. What else belongs to Manhood still? I'm old enough to make my will With valid clause and codicil Before in turf I lie. But I have nothing to bequeath In earth, or waters underneath, And in all candour let me breathe, I do not want to die. Away! if this be Manhood's forte, Put by the sherry and the portâ No ring of bellsâno rustic sportâ No danceâno merry pipes! No flowery garlandsâno bouquetâ No Birthday Ode to sing or sayâ To me it seems this is a day For bread and cheese and swipes. To justify the festive cup What horrors here are conjured up! What things of bitter bite and sup, Poor wretched Twenty-One's! No landed lumps, but frumps and humps, (Discretion's Days are far from trumps) Domestic discord, dowdies, dumps, Death, dockets, debts, and duns! If you must drink, oh drink âthe King.â Reformâthe Churchâthe Pressâthe Ring, Drink Aldgate Pumpâor anything, Before a toast like this! Nay, tell me, coming thus of age, And turning o'er this sorry page, Was young Nineteen so far from sage? Or young Eighteen from bliss? Till this dull, cold, wet, happy mornâ No sign of May about the thorn,â Were Love and Bacchus both unborn? Had Beauty, not a shape? Make answer, sweet Kate Finnerty! Make answer, lads of Trinity! Who sipp'd with me Divinity, And quaff'd the ruby grape! No flummery then from flowery lips, No three times three and hip-hip-hips, Because I'm ripe and full of pipsâ I like a little green. To put me on my solemn oath, If sweep-like I could stop my growth I would remain, and nothing loth, A boyâabout nineteen. My friends, excuse me these rebukes! Were I a monarch's son, or duke's, Go to the Vatican of Meux And broach his biggest barrelsâ Impale whole elephants on spitsâ Ring Tom of Lincoln till he splits, And dance into St. Vitus' fits, And break your winds with carols! But ah! too well you know my lot, Ancestral acres greet me not, My freehold's in a garden-pot, And barely worth a pin. Away then with all festive stuff! Let Robins advertise and puff My âMan's Estate,â I'm sure enough I shall not buy it in. A SINGULAR EXHIBITION AT SOMERSET HOUSE âOur Crummie is a dainty cow.â âScotch Song. On that first Saturday in May, When Lords and Ladies, great and grand, Repair to see what each R.A. Has done since last they sought the Strand, In red, brown, yellow, green, or blue, In short, what's call'd the private view,â Amongst the guestsâthe deuce knows how She got in there without a rowâ There came a large and vulgar dame With arms deep red, and face the same, Showing in temper not a Saint; No one could guess for why she came, Unless perchance to âscour the Paint.â From wall to wall she forc'd her way, Elbow'd Lord Durhamâpok'd Lord Greyâ Stamp'd Stafford's toes to make him move, And Devonshire's Duke received a shove; The great Lord Chancellor felt her nudge, She made the Vice, his Honour, budge, And gave a pinch to Park the Judge. As for the ladies, in this stir, The highest rank gave way to her. From number one and number two, She search'd the pictures through and through, On benches stood to inspect the high ones. And squatted down to scan the shy ones; And as she went from part to part, A deeper red each cheek became, Her very eyes lit up in flame, That made each looker-on exclaim, âReally an ardent love of art!â Alas, amidst her inquisition, Fate brought her to a sad condition; She might have run against Lord Milton, And still have stared at deeds in oil, But ah! her picture-joy to spoil, She came full butt on Mr. Hilton. The Keeper mute, with staring eyes Like a lay-figure for surprise, At last thus stammered out, âHow now? Womanâwhere, woman, is your ticket, That ought to let you through our wicket?â Says woman, âWhere is David's Cow?â Said Mr. H?, with expedition, âThere's no Cow in the Exhibition.â âNo Cow!ââbut here her tongue in verity Set off with steam and rail celerityâ âNo Cow! there an't no Cow, then the more's the shame and pity, Hang you and the R.A.'s, and all the Hanging Committee! No Cowâbut hold your tongue, for you needn't talk to meâ You can't talk up the Cow, you can't, to where it ought to beâ I haven't seen a picture high or low, or any how, Or in any of the rooms, to be compared with David's Cow! You may talk of your Landseers, and of your Coopers, and your Wards, Why hanging is too good for them, and yet here they are on cords! They're only fit for window frames, and shutters, and street-doors, David will paint 'em any day at Red Lions or Blue Boars,â Why Morland was a fool to him, at a little pig or sowâ It's really hard it an't hung upâI could cry about the Cow! But I know well what it is, and whyâthey're jealous of David's fame, But to vent it on the Cow, poor thing, is a cruelty and a shame. Do you think it might hang bye and bye, if you cannot hang it now? David has made a party up, to come and see his Cow. If it only hung three days a week, for an example to the learners, Why can't it hang up, turn about, with that picture of Mr. Turner's? Or do you think from Mr. Etty, you need apprehend a row, If now and then you cut him down to hang up David's Cow? I can't think where their tastes have been, to not have such a creature, Although I say, that should not say, it was prettier than Nature; It must be hungâand shall be hung, for, Mr. H?, I vow, I daren't take home the catalogue, unless it's got the Cow! As we only want it to be seen, I should not so much care, If it was only round the stone man's neck, a-coming up the stair. Or down there in the marble room, where all the figures stand, Where one of them Three Graces might just hold it in her handâ Or may be Bailey's Charity the favour would allow, It would really be a charity to hang up David's Cow. We haven't nowhere else to go if you don't hang it here, The Water-Colour place allows no oilman to appearâ And the British Gallery sticks to Dutch, Teniers, and Gerrard Douw, And the Suffolk Gallery will not doâit's not a Suffolk Cow: I wish you'd seen him painting her, he hardly took his meals Till she was painted on the board correct from head to heels; His heart and soul was in his Cow, and almost made him shabby, He hardly whipp'd the boys at all, or help'd to nurse the babby. And when he had her all complete and painted over red, He got so grand, I really thought him going off his head. Now hang it, Mr. Hilton, do just hang it any how: Poor David, he will hang himself unless you hang his Cow.â And if it's unconvenient and drawn too big by halfâ David shan't send next year except a very little calf.â I'M GOING TO BOMBAY âNothing venture, nothing have.â âOld Proverb. âEvery Indiaman has at least two mates.â âFalconer's Marine Guide. I My hair is brown, my eyes are blue, And reckon'd rather bright; I'm shapely, if they tell me true, And just the proper height; My skin has been admired in verse, And call'd as fair as dayâ If I am fair, so much the worse, I'm going to Bombay! II At school I passed with some Ã©clat; I learn'd my French in France; De Wint gave lessons how to draw, And D'Egville how to dance;â Crevelli taught me how to sing, And Cramer how to playâ It really is the strangest thingâ I'm going to Bombay! III I've been to Bath and Cheltenham Wells, But not their springs to sipâ To Ramsgateânot to pick up shells,â To Brightonânot to dip. I've tour'd the Lakes, and scour'd the coast From Scarboro' to Torquayâ But tho' of time I've made the most, I'm going to Bombay! IV By Pa and Ma I'm daily told To marry now's my time, For though I'm very far from old, I'm rather in my prime. They say while we have any sun We ought to make our hayâ And India has so hot an one, I'm going to Bombay! V My cousin writes from Hyderapot My only chance to snatch, And says the climate is so hot, It's sure to light a match.â She's married to a son of Mars, With very handsome pay, And swears I ought to thank my stars I'm going to Bombay! VI She says that I shall much delight To taste their Indian treats, But what she likes may turn me quite, Their strange outlandish meats.â If I can eat rupees, who knows? Or dine, the Indian way, On doolies and on bungalowsâ I'm going to Bombay! VII She says that I shall much enjoy,â I don't know what she means,â To take the air and buy some toy, In my own palankeens,â I like to drive my pony-chair, Or ride our dapple greyâ But elephants are horses thereâ I'm going to Bombay! VIII Farewell, farewell, my parents dear, My friends, farewell to them! And oh, what costs a sadder tear, Good-bye, to Mr. M.!â If I should find an Indian vault, Or fall a tiger's prey, Or steep in salt, it's all his fault, I'm going to Bombay! IX That fine new teak-built ship, the Fox, A. I.âCommander Bird, Now lying in the London docks, Will sail on May the Third; Apply for passage or for freight, To Nichol, Scott, and Grayâ Pa has applied and seal'd my fateâ I'm going to Bombay! X My heart is fullâmy trunks as well; My mind and caps made up, My corsets, shap'd by Mrs. Bell, Are promised ere I sup; With boots and shoes, Rivarta's best, And dresses by DucÃ©, And a special licence in my chestâ I'm going to Bombay! ODE TO THE ADVOCATES FOR THE REMOVAL OF SMITHFIELD MARKET âSweeping our flocks and herds.â âDouglas. O philanthropic men! For this address I need not make apologyâ Who aim at clearing out the Smithfield pen, And planting further off its vile Zoologyâ Permit me thus to tell, I like your efforts well, For routing that great nest of Hornithology! Be not dismay'd, although repulsed at first, And driven from their Horse, and Pig, and Lamb parts, Charge on!âyou shall upon their hornworks burst, And carry all their Bull-warks and their Ram-parts. Go on, ye wholesale drovers! And drive away the Smithfield flocks and herds! As wild as Tartar-Curds, That come so fat, and kicking, from their clovers, Off with them all!âthose restive brutes, that vex Our streets, and plunge, and lunge, and butt, and battle; And save the female sex From being cow'dâlike IÃ¶âby the cattle! Fancyâwhen droves appear on The hill of Holborn, roaring from its top,â Your ladiesâready, as they own, to drop, Taking themselves to Thomson's with a Fear-on! Or, in St. Martin's Lane, Scared by a Bullock, in a frisky vein,â Fancy the terror of your timid daughters, While rushing souse Into a coffee-house, To find itâSlaughter's! Or fancy this:â Walking along the street, some stranger Miss, Her head with no such thought of danger laden, When suddenly 'tis âAries Taurus Virgo!ââ You don't know Latin, I translate it ergo, Into your Areas a Bull throws the Maiden! Think of some poor old crone Treated, just like a penny, with a toss! At that vile spot now grown So generally known For making a Cow Cross! Nay, fancy your own selves far off from stall, Or shed, or shopâand that an Ox infuriate Just pins you to the wall, Giving you a strong dose of Oxy-Muriate! Methinks I hear the neighbours that live round The Market-ground Thus make appeal unto their civic fellowsâ â'Tis well for you that live apartâunable To hear this brutal Babel, But our firesides are troubled with their bellows. âFolks that too freely sup Must e'en put up With their own troubles if they can't digest; But we must needs regard The case as hard That others' victuals should disturb our rest, That from our sleep your food should start and jump us! We like, ourselves, a steak, But, Sirs, for pity's sake! We don't want oxen at our doors to rump-us! âIf we do dozeâit really is too bad! We constantly are roar'd awake or rung, Through bullocks mad That run in all the âNight Thoughtsâ of our Young!â Such are the woes of sleepersânow let's take The woes of those that wish to keep a Wake! Oh think! when Wombwell gives his annual feasts, Think of these âBulls of Basan,â far from mild ones; Such fierce tame beasts, That nobody much cares to see the Wild ones! Think of the Show woman, âwhat shows a Dwarf,â Seeing a red Cow come To swallow her Tom Thumb, And forc'd with broom of birch to keep her off! Think, too, of Messrs. Richardson and Co., When looking at their public private boxes, To see in the back row Three live sheeps' heads, a porker's, and an Ox's! Think of their Orchestra, when two horns come Through, to accompany the double drum! Or, in the midst of murder and remorses, Just when the Ghost is certain, A great rent in the curtain, And enter two tall skeletonsâof Horses! Great Philanthropics! pray urge these topics Upon the Solemn Councils of the Nation, Get a Bill soon, and give, some noon, The Bulls, a Bull of Excommunication! Let the old Fair have fair-play as its right, And to each show and sight Ye shall be treated with a Free List latitude; To Richardson's Stage Dramas, Dioâand Cosmoâramas, Giants and Indians wild, Dwarf, Sea Bear, and Fat Child, And that most rare of Showsâa Show of Gratitude! ODE FOR ST. CECILIA'S EVE âLook out for squalls.â âThe Pilot. O come, dear Barney Isaacs, come, Punch for one night can spare his drum As well as pipes of Pan! Forget not, Popkins, your bassoon, Nor, Mister Bray, your horn, as soon As you can leave the Van; Blind Billy, bring your violin; Miss Crow, you're great in Cherry Ripe! And Chubb, your viol must drop in Its bass to Soger Tommy's pipe. Ye butchers, bring your bones: An organ would not be amiss; If grinding Jim has spouted his, Lend yours, good Mister Jones. Do, hurdy-gurdy Jenny,âdo Keep sober for an hour or two, Music's charms to help to paint. And, Sandy Gray, if you should not Your bagpipes bringâO tuneful Scot! Conceive the feelings of the Saint! Miss Strummel issues an invite, For music, and turn-out to-night In honour of Cecilia's session; But ere you go, one moment stop, And with all kindness let me drop A hint to you, and your profession; Imprimis then: Pray keep within The bounds to which your skill was born; Let the one-handed let alone Trombone, Don'tâRheumatiz! seize the violin, Or Ashmy snatch the horn! Don't ever to such rows give birth, As if you had no end on earth, Except to âwake the lyre;â Don't âstrike the harp,â pray never do, Till others long to strike it too, Perpetual harping's apt to tire; Oh, I have heard such flat-and-sharpers. I've blest the head Of good King Ned, For scragging all those old Welsh Harpers. Pray, never, ere each tuneful doing, Take a prodigious deal of wooing; And then sit down to thrum the strain, As if you'd never rise againâ The least Cecilia-like of things; Remember that the Saint has wings. I've known Miss Strummel pause an hour, Ere she could âPluck the Fairest Flower.â Yet without hesitation, she Plunged next into the âDeep Deep Sea,â And when on the keys she does begin, Such awful torments soon you share, She really seems like Milton's âSin,â Holding the keys ofâyou know where! Never tweak people's ears so toughly, That urchin-like they can't help sayingâ âO dear! O dearâyou call this playing, But oh, it's playing very roughly!â Oft, in the ecstasy of pain, I've cursed all instrumental workmen, Wish'd Broadwood Thurtell'd in a lane, And Kirke White's fate to every Kirkmanâ I really once delighted spied âClementi Collardâ in Cheapside. Another word,âdon't be surpris'd, Revered and ragged street Musicians, You have been only half-baptis'd, And each name proper, or improper, Is not the value of a copper, Till it has had the due additions, Husky, Rusky, Ninny, Tinny, Hummel, Bummel, Bowski, Wowski, All these are very good selectables; But none of your plain pudding-and-tamesâ Folks that are called the hardest names Are music's most respectables. Ev'ry woman, ev'ry man, Look as foreign as you can, Don't cut your hair, or wash your skin, Make ugly faces and begin! Each Dingy Orpheus gravely hears. And now to show they understand it! Miss Crow her scrannel throttle clears, And all the rest prepare to band it. Each scraper right for concertante, Rozins the hair of Rozinante: Then all sound A, if they know which, That they may join like birds in June; Jack Tar alone neglects to tune, For he's all over concert-pitch. A little prelude goes before, Like a knock and ring at music's door. Each instrument gives in its name; Then sitting in They all begin To play a musical round game. Scrapenberg, as the eldest hand, Leads a first fiddle to the band, A second follows suit; Anon the ace of Horns comes plump On the two fiddles with a trump, Puffindorf plays a flute. This sort of musical revoke, The grave bassoon begins to smoke, And in rather grumpy kind Of tone begins to speak its mind; The double drum is next to mix, Playing the Devil on Two Sticksâ Clamour, clamour, Hammer, hammer, While now and then a pipe is heard, Insisting to put in a word, With all his shrilly best, So to allow the little minion Time to deliver his opinion, They take a few bars rest. Well, little Pipe beginsâwith sole And small voice going thro' the hole, Beseeching, Preaching, Squealing, Appealing, Now as high as he can go, Now in language rather low, And having doneâbegins once more, Verbatim what he said before. This twiddling twaddling sets on fire All the old instrumental ire, And fiddles for explosion ripe, Put out the little squeaker's pipe; This wakes bass violâand viol for that, Seizing on innocent little B flat, Shakes it like terrier shaking a ratâ They all seem miching malicho! To judge from a rumble unawares, The drum has had a pitch downstairs; And the trumpet rash, By a violent crash, Seems splitting somebody's calico! The viol too groans in deep distress, As if he suddenly grew sick; And one rapid fiddle sets off express,â Hurrying, Scurrying, Spattering, Clattering, To fetch him a Doctor of Music. This tumult sets the Haut-boy crying Beyond the Piano's pacifying, The cymbal Gets nimble, Triangle Must wrangle, The band is becoming most martial of bands, When just in the middle, A quakerly fiddle, Proposes a general shaking of hands! Quaking, Shaking, Quivering, Shivering, Long bowâshort bowâeach bow drawing: Some like filing,âsome like sawing; At last these agitations cease, And they all get The flageolet, To breathe âa piping time of peace.â Ah, too deceitful charm, Like light'ning before death, For Scrapenberg to rest his arm, And Puffindorf get breath! Again without remorse or pity, They play âThe Storming of a City,â Miss S. herself compos'd and plann'd itâ When lo! at this renew'd attack, Up jumps a little man in black,â âThe very Devil cannot stand it!â And with that, Snatching hat, (Not his own,) Off is flown, Thro' the door, In his black, To come back, Never, never, never more! O Music! praises thou hast had, From Dryden and from Pope, For thy good notes, yet none I hope, But I, e'er praised the bad, Yet are not saint and sinner even? Miss Strummel on Cecilia's level? One drew an angel down from heaven! The other scar'd away the Devil! A BLOW-UP âHere we go up, up, up.â âThe Lay of the First Minstrel. Near Battle, Mr. Peter Baker Was Powder-maker, Not Alderman Flower's flour,âthe white that puffs And primes and loads heads bald, or grey, or chowder, Figgins and Higgins, Fippins, Filby,âCrowder, Not vile apothecary's pounded stuffs, But something blacker, bloodier, and louder, Gun-powder! This stuff, as people know, is semper Eadem; very hasty in its temperâ Like Honour that resents the gentlest taps, Mere semblances of blows, however slight; So powder fires, although you only p'rhaps Strike light. To make it therefore, is a ticklish business, And sometimes gives both head and heart a dizziness, For as all human flash and fancy minders, Frequenting fights and Powder-works well know, There seldom is a mill without a blow, Sometimes upon the grinders. But thenâthe melancholy phrase to soften, Mr. B.'s mill transpir'd so very often! And advertisedâthan all Price Currents louder, âFragments look upâthere is a rise in Powder,â So frequently, it caused the neighbours' wonder,â And certain people had the inhumanity To lay it all to Mr. Baker's vanity, That he might have to sayââThat was my thunder!â One dayâso goes the tale, Whether, with iron hoof, Not sparkle-proof, Some ninny-hammer struck upon a nail,â Whether some glow-worm of the Guy Faux stamp, Crept in the building, with Unsafety Lampâ One day this mill that had by water ground, Became a sort of windmill and blew round. With bounce that went in sound as far as Dover, it Sent half the workmen sprawling to the sky; Besides some visitors who gained thereby, What they had askedâpermission âto go over it!â Of course it was a very hard and high blow, And somewhat differed from what's called a flyblow. At Cowes' Regatta, as I once observed, A pistol-shot made twenty vessels start; If such a sound could terrify oak's heart, Think how this crash the human nerve unnerved. In fact it was a very awful thing,â As people know that have been used to battle, In springing either mine or mill, you spring A precious rattle! The dunniest heard itâpoor old Mr. F. Doubted for once if he was ever deaf; Through Tunbridge town it caused most strange alarms, Mr. and Mrs. Fogg, Who lived like cat and dog, Were shocked for once into each other's arms. Miss M. the millinerâher fright so strong, Made a great gobble-stitch six inches long; The veriest quakers quaked against their wish; The âBest of Sonsâ was taken unawares, And kicked the âBest of Parentsâ down the stairs: The steadiest servant dropped the China dish; A thousand started, though there was but one Fated to win, and that was Mister Dunn, Who struck convulsively, and hooked a fish! Miss Wiggins, with some grass upon her fork, Toss'd it just like a haymaker at work; Her sister not in any better case, For taking wine With nervous Mr. Pyne, He jerked his glass of Sherry in her face. Poor Mistress Davy, Bobb'd off her bran-new turban in the gravy; While Mr. Davy at the lower end, Preparing for a Goose a carver's labour, Darted his two-pronged weapon in his neighbour, As if for once he meant to help a friend. The nurse-maid telling little âJack-a-Norey,â âBo-peep,â and âBlue-capâ at the house's top, Scream'd, and let Master Jeremiah drop From a fourth storey! Nor yet did matters any better go With Cook and Housemaid in the realms below; As for the Laundress, timid Martha Gunning, Expressing faintness and her fears by fits And starts,âshe came at last but to her wits, By falling in the ale that John left running. Grave Mr. Miles, the meekest of mankind, Struck all at once, deaf, stupid, dumb, and blind, Sat in his chaise some moments like a corse, Then coming to his mind, Was shocked to find, Only a pair of shafts without a horse. Out scrambled all the Misses from Miss Joy's! From Prospect House, for urchins small and big, Hearing the awful noise, Out rushed a flood of boys, Floating a man in black, without a wig;â Some carried out one treasure, some another,â Some caught their tops and taws up in a hurry, Some saved Chambaud, some rescued Lindley Murray, But little Tiddy carried his big brother! Sick of such terrors, The Tunbridge folks resolv'd that truth should dwell No longer secret in a Tunbridge Well, But to warn Baker of his dangerous errors; Accordingly to bring the point to pass, They call'd a meeting of the broken glass, The shatter'd chimney pots, and scatter'd tiles, The damage of each part, And packed it in a cart, Drawn by the horse that ran from Mr. Miles; While Doctor Babblethorpe, the worthy Rector, And Mr. Gammage, cutler to George Rex, And some few more, whose names would only vex, Went as a deputation to the Ex- Powder-proprietor and Mill-director. Now Mr. Baker's dwelling-house had pleased Along with mill-materials to roam, And for a time the deputies were teased, To find the noisy gentleman at home; At last they found him with undamaged skin, Safe at the Tunbridge Armsânot outâbut Inn. The worthy Rector, with uncommon zeal, Soon put his spoke in for the common wealâ A grave old gentlemanly kind of Urban,â The piteous tale of Jeremiah moulded, And then unfolded, By way of climax, Mrs. Davy's turban; He told how auctioneering Mr. Pidding Knock'd down a lot without a bidding,â How Mr. Miles, in fright, had giv'n his mare, The whip she wouldn't bear,â At Prospect House, how Doctor Oates, not Titus, Danced like Saint Vitus,â And Mr. Beak, thro' Powder's misbehaving, Cut off his nose whilst shaving;â When suddenly, with words that seem'd like swearing, Beyond a Licenser's belief or bearingâ Broke in the stuttering, sputtering Mr. Gammageâ âWho is to pay us, Sirââhe argued thus, âFor loss of cus-cus-cus-cus-cus-cus-cusâ Cus-custom, and the dam-dam-dam-dam-damage?â Now many a person had been fairly puzzled By such assailants, and completely muzzled; Baker, however, was not dash'd with easeâ But proved he practised after their own system, And with small ceremony soon dismiss'd 'em, Putting these words into their ears like fleas: âIf I do have a blow, well, where's the oddity? I merely do as other tradesmen do, You, Sir,âand youâand you! I'm only puffing off my own commodity!â THE GHOST A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD âI'll be your second.â âListon. In Middle Row, some years ago, There lived one Mr. Brown; And many folks considered him The stoutest man in town. But Brown and stout will both wear out, One Friday he died hard, And left a widow'd wife to mourn, At twenty pence a yard. Now widow B. in two short months Thought mourning quite a tax, And wish'd, like Mr. Wilberforce, To manumit her blacks. With Mr. Street she soon was sweet; The thing thus came about: She asked him in at home, and then At church he asked her out! Assurance such as this the man In ashes could not stand; So like a PhÅnix he rose up Against the Hand in Hand. One dreary night the angry sprite Appeared before her view; It came a little after one, But she was after two! âOh Mrs. B., oh Mrs. B.! Are these your sorrow's deeds, Already getting up a flame, To burn your widow's weeds? âIt's not so long since I have left For aye the mortal scene; My Memoryâlike Rogers's, Should still be bound in green! âYet if my face you still retrace I almost have a doubtâ I'm like an old Forget-Me-Not, With all the leaves torn out! âTo think that on that finger joint Another pledge should cling; Oh Bess! upon my very soul, It struck like âKnock and Ring.â âA ton of marble on my breast Can't hinder my return; Your conduct, Ma'am, has set my blood A-boiling in my urn! âRemember, oh! remember, how The marriage rite did run,â If ever we one flesh should be, 'Tis nowâwhen I have none! âAnd you, Sirâonce a bosom friendâ Of perjured faith convict, As ghostly toe can give no blow, Consider you are kick'd. âA hollow voice is all I have, But this I tell you plain, Marry come up!âyou marry, Ma'am, And I'll come up again.â More he had said, but chanticleer The spritely shade did shock With sudden crow, and off he went, Like fowling-piece at cock! ODE TO MADAME HENGLER FIREWORK-MAKER TO VAUXHALL Oh, Mrs. Hengler!âMadame,âI beg pardon; Starry Enchantress of the Surrey Garden! Accept an Ode not meant as any scoffâ The Bard were bold indeed at thee to quiz, Whose squibs are far more popular than his; Whose works are much more certain to go off. Great is thy fame, but not a silent fame; With many a bang the public ear it courts; And yet thy arrogance we never blame, But take thy merits from thy own reports. Thou hast indeed the most indulgent backers, We make no doubting, misbelieving comments, Even in thy most bounceable of moments; But lend our ears implicit to thy crackers!â Strange helps to thy applause too are not missing, Thy Rockets raise thee, And Serpents praise thee, As none beside are ever praisedâby hissing! Mistress of Hydropyrics, Of glittering Pindarics, Sapphics, Lyrics, Professor of a Fiery Necromancy, Oddly thou charmest the politer sorts With midnight sports, Partaking very much of flash and fancy! What thoughts had shaken all In olden time at thy nocturnal revels,â Each brimstone ball, They would have deem'd an eyeball of the Devil's! But now thy flaming Meteors cause no fright; A modern Hubert to the royal ear, Might whisper without fear, âMy Lord, they say there were five moons to-night! Nor would it raise one superstitious notion To hear the whole description fairly out:â âOne fixedâwhich t'other four whirl'd round about With wond'rous motion.â Such are the very sights Thou workest, Queen of Fire, on earth and heaven, Between the hours of midnight and eleven, Turning our English to Arabian Nights, With blazing mounts, and founts, and scorching dragons, Blue stars and white. And blood-red light, And dazzling Wheels fit for Enchanters' waggons. Thrice lucky woman! doing things that be With other folks past benefit of parson; For burning, no Burn's Justice falls on thee, Altho' night after night the public see Thy Vauxhall palaces all end in Arson! Sure thou wast never born Like old Sir Hugh, with water in thy head, Nor lectur'd night and morn Of sparks and flames to have an awful dread, Allowed by a prophetic dam and sire To play with fire. O didst thou never, in those days gone by, Go carrying aboutâno schoolboy prouderâ Instead of waxen doll a little Guy; Or in thy pretty pyrotechnic vein, Up the parental pigtail lay a train, To let off all his powder? Full of the wildfire of thy youth, Did'st never in plain truth, Plant whizzing Flowers in thy mother's pots, Turning the garden into powder plots? Or give the cook, to fright her, Thy paper sausages well stuffed with nitre? Nay, wert thou never guilty, now, of dropping A lighted cracker by thy sister's Dear, So that she could not hear The question he was popping? Go on, Madame! Go onâbe bright and busy While hoax'd Astronomers look up and stare From tall observatories, dumb and dizzy, To see a Squib in Cassiopeia's Chair! A Serpent wriggling into Charles's Wain! A Roman Candle lighting the Great Bear! A Rocket tangled in Diana's train, And Crackers stuck in Berenice's Hair! There is a King of FireâThou shouldst be Queen! Methinks a good connexion might come from it; Could'st thou not make him, in the garden scene, Set out per Rocket and return per Comet; Then give him a hot treat Of Pyrotechnicals to sit and sup, Lord! how the world would throng to see him eat, He swallowing fire, while thou dost throw it up! One solitary nightâtrue is the story, Watching those forms that Fancy will create Within the bright confusion of the grate, I saw a dazzling countenance of glory! Oh Dei gratias! That fiery facias 'Twas thine, Enchantress of the Surrey Grove; And ever since that night, In dark and bright, Thy face is registered within my stove! Long may that starry brow enjoy its rays; May no untimely blow its doom forestall; But when old age prepares the friendly pall, When the last spark of all thy sparks decays, Then die lamented by good people all, Like Goldsmith's Madam Blaize! THE DOUBLE KNOCK Rat-tat it went upon the lion's chin, âThat hat, I know it!â cried the joyful girl; âSummer's it is, I know him by his knock, Comers like him are welcome as the day! Lizzy! go down and open the street-door, Busy I am to any one but him. Know him you mustâhe has been often here; Show him up stairs, and tell him I'm alone.â Quickly the maid went tripping down the stair; Thickly the heart of Rose Matilda beat; âSure he has brought me tickets for the playâ Druryâor Covent Gardenâdarling man!â Kemble will playâor Kean who makes the soul Tremble; in Richard or the frenzied Moorâ Farren, the stay and prop of many a farce Barren besideâor Liston, Laughter's Childâ Kelly the natural, to witness whom Jelly is nothing to the public's jamâ Cooper, the sensibleâand Walter Knowles Super, in William Tell, now rightly told.

Dearly I dote on whiteâmy satin dress, Merely one nightâit won't be much the worseâ Cupidâthe New Ballet I long to seeâ Stupid! why don't she go and ope the door!â Glisten'd her eye as the impatient girl Listen'd, low bending o'er the topmost stair, Vainly, alas! she listens and she bends, Plainly she hears this question and reply: âAxes your pardon, Sir, but what d'ye want?â âTaxes,â says he, âand shall not call again!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BAILEY BALLADS LINES TO MARY (AT NO. I NEWGATE, FAVOURED BY MR. WONTNER) O Mary, I believ'd you true, And I was blest in so believing; But till this hour I never knewâ That you were taken up for thieving! Oh! when I snatch'd a tender kiss, Or some such trifle when I courted, You said, indeed, that love was bliss, But never owned you were transported! But then to gaze on that fair faceâ It would have been an unfair feeling, To dream that you had pilfered laceâ And Flints had suffer'd from your stealing! Or when my suit I first preferr'd, To bring your coldness to repentance, Before I hammer'd out a word, How could I dream you'd heard a sentence! Or when with all the warmth of youth I strove to prove my love no fiction, How could I guess I urged a truth On one already past conviction! How could I dream that ivory part, Your handâwhere I have look'd and linger'd, Altho' it stole away my heart, Had been held up as one light-finger'd! In melting verse your charms I drew, The charms in which my muse delightedâ Alas! the lay, I thought was new, Spoke only what had been indicted! Oh! when that form, a lovely one, Hung on the neck its arms had flown to, I little thought that you had run A chance of hanging on your own too. You said you pick'd me from the world, My vanity it now must shock itâ And down at once my pride is hurl'd, You've pick'd meâand you've pick'd a pocket! Oh! when our love had got so far, The banns were read by Dr. Daly, Who asked if there was any barâ Why did not some one shout, âOld Bailey?â But when you rob'd your flesh and bones In that pure white that angel garb is, Who could have thought you, Mary Jones Among the Joans that link with Darbies? And when the parson came to say, My goods were yours, if I had got any, And you should honour and obey, Who could have thoughtââO Bay of Botany!â But, oh,âthe worst of all your slips I did not till this day discoverâ That down in Deptford's prison ships, Oh, Mary! you've a hulking lover! No. II [He has shav'd off his whiskers and blacken'd his brows] âLove with a witness!â He has shav'd off his whiskers and blacken'd his brows, Wears a patch and a wig of false hair,â But it's himâOh it's him!âwe exchanged lovers' vows When I lived up in Cavendish Square. He had beautiful eyes, and his lips were the same, And his voice was as soft as a fluteâ Like a Lord or a Marquis he look'd, when he came To make love in his master's best suit. If I lived for a thousand long years from my birth, I shall never forget what he told; How he lov'd me beyond the rich women of earth, With their jewels and silver and gold! When he kiss'd me, and bade me adieu with a sigh, By the light of the sweetest of moons, Oh how little I dreamt I was bidding good-bye To my Missis's tea-pot and spoons! No. III [We metâ'twas in a mobâand I thought he had done meâ] âI'd be a parody.â âBailey. We metâ'twas in a mobâand I thought he had done meâ I feltâI could not feelâfor no watch was upon me; He ranâthe night was coldâand his pace was unalter'd, I too longed much to peltâbut my small-boned legs falter'd. I wore my bran new bootsâand unrivall'd their brightness; They fit me to a hairâhow I hated their tightness! I call'd, but no one came, and my stride had a tether, Oh thou hast been the cause of this anguish, my leather! And once again we metâand an old pal was near him, He swore, a something lowâbut 'twas no use to fear him; I seized upon his arm, he was mine and mine only, And steptâas he deserv'dâto cells wretched and lonely: And there he will be triedâbut I shall ne'er receive her, The watch that went too sure for an artful deceiver; The world may think me gay,âheart and feet ache together, Oh thou hast been the cause of this anguish, my leather.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRENCH AND ENGLISH âGood heaven! Why even the little children in France speak French!â âAddison. I Never go to France Unless you know the lingo, If you do, like me, You will repent, by jingo. Staring like a fool, And silent as a mummy, There I stood alone, A nation with a dummy: II Chaises stand for chairs, They christen letters Billies, They call their mothers mares, And all their daughters fillies; Strange it was to hear, I'll tell you what's a good 'un, They call their leather queer, And half their shoes are wooden. III Signs I had to make For every little notion, Limbs all going like A telegraph in motion, For wine I reel'd about, To show my meaning fully, And made a pair of horns, To ask for âbeef and bully.â IV Moo!

If I wanted bread, My jaws I set a-going, And asked for new-laid eggs, By clapping hands and crowing!

OUR VILLAGE.âBY A VILLAGER âSweet Auburn, loveliest village of the plain.â âGoldsmith. Our village, that's to say not Miss Mitford's village, but our village of Bullock Smithy, Is come into by an avenue of trees, three oak pollards, two elders, and a withy; And in the middle, there's a green of about not exceeding an acre and a half; It's common to all, and fed off by nineteen cows, six ponies, three horses, five asses, two foals, seven pigs, and a calf! Besides a pond in the middle, as is held by a similar sort of common law lease, And contains twenty ducks, six drakes, three ganders, two dead dogs, four drown'd kittens, and twelve geese. Of course the green's cropt very close, and does famous for bowling when the little village boys play at cricket; Only some horse, or pig, or cow, or great jackass, is sure to come and stand right before the wicket. There's fifty-five private houses, let alone barns and workshops, and pigstyes, and poultry huts, and such-like sheds; With plenty of public-housesâtwo Foxes, one Green Man, three Bunch of Grapes, one Crown, and six King's Heads. The Green Man is reckon'd the best, as the only one that for love or money can raise A postilion, a blue jacket, two deplorable lame white horses, and a ramshackled âneat postchaise.â There's one parish church for all the people, whatsoever may be their ranks in life or their degrees, Except one very damp, small, dark, freezing-cold, little Methodist chapel of Ease; And close by the church-yard there's a stone-mason's yard, that when the time is seasonable Will furnish with afflictions sore and marble urns and cherubims very low and reasonable. There's a cage, comfortable enough; I've been in it with old Jack Jeffrey and Tom Pike; For the Green Man next door will send you in ale, gin, or any thing else you like. I can't speak of the stocks, as nothing remains of them but the upright post; But the pound is kept in repairs for the sake of Cob's horse, as is always there almost. There's a smithy of course, where that queer sort of a chap in his way, Old Joe Bradley, Perpetually hammers and stammers, for he stutters and shoes horses very badly. There's a shop of all sorts, that sells every thing, kept by the widow of Mr. Task; But when you go there it's ten to one she's out of every thing you ask. You'll know her house by the swarm of boys, like flies, about the old sugary cask: There are six empty houses, and not so well paper'd inside as out, For bill-stickers won't beware, but sticks notices of sales and election placards all about. That's the Doctor's with a green door, where the garden pots in the windows is seen; A weakly monthly rose that don't blow, and a dead geranium, and a tea-plant with five black leaves and one green. As for hollyoaks at the cottage doors, and honeysuckles and jasmines, you may go and whistle; But the Tailor's front garden grows two cabbages, a dock, a ha'porth of penny-royal, two dandelions, and a thistle. There are three small orchardsâMr. Busby's the schoolmaster's is the chiefâ With two pear-trees that don't bear; one plum and an apple, that every year is stripped by a thief. There's another small day-school too, kept by the respectable Mrs. Gaby. A select establishment, for six little boys and one big, and four little girls and a baby; There's a rectory, with pointed gables and strange odd chimneys that never smokes, For the rector don't live on his living like other Christian sort of folks; There's a barber's, once a-week well filled with rough black-bearded, shock-headed churls, And a window with two feminine men's heads, and two masculine ladies in false curls; There's a butcher's, and a carpenter's, and a plumber's, and a small green-grocer's, and a baker, But he won't bake on a Sunday, and there's a sexton that's a coal-merchant besides, and an undertaker; And a toy-shop, but not a whole one, for a village can't compare with the London shops; One window sells drums, dolls, kites, carts, bats, Clout's balls, and the other sells malt and hops. And Mrs. Brown, in domestic economy not to be a bit behind her betters, Lets her house to a milliner, a watchmaker, a rat-catcher, a cobler, lives in it herself, and it's the post-office for letters. Now I've gone through all the villageâay, from end to end, save and except one more house, But I haven't come to thatâand I hope I never shallâand that's the Village Poor House! A TRUE STORY Whoe'er has seen upon the human face The yellow jaundice and the jaundice black, May form a notion of old Colonel Case With nigger Pompey waiting at his back. Case,âas the case is, many time with folks From hot Bengal, Calcutta, or Bombay, Had tint his tint, as Scottish tongues would say, And show'd two cheeks as yellow as eggs' yolks. Pompey, the chip of some old ebon block, In hue was like his master's stiff cravat, And might indeed have claimed akin to that, Coming, as he did, of an old black stock. Case wore the liver's livery that such Must wear, their past excesses to denote, Like Greenwich pensioners that take too much, And then do penance in a yellow coat. Pompey's, a deep and permanent jet dye, A stain of nature's stainingâone of those We call fast coloursâmerely, I suppose, Because such colours never go or fly. Pray mark this difference of dark and sallow, Pompey's black husk, and the old Colonel's yellow. The Colonel, once a pennyless beginner, From a long Indian rubber rose a winner, With plenty of pagodas in his pocket, And homeward turning his Hibernian thought, Deemed Wicklow was the very place that ought To harbour one whose wick was in the socket. Unhappily for Case's scheme of quiet, Wicklow just then was in a pretty riot, A fact recorded in each day's diurnals, Things, Case was not accustomed to peruse, Careless of news; But Pompey always read these bloody journals, Full of Killmany and of Killmore work, The freaks of some O'Shaunessy's shillaly, Of morning frays by some O'Brien Burke, Or horrid nightly outrage by some Daly; How scums deserving of the Devil's ladle, Would fall upon the harmless scull and knock it, And if he found an infant in the cradle Stern Rock would hardly hesitate to rock it;â In fact, he read of burner and of killer, And Irish ravages, day after day, Till, haunting in his dreams, he used to say, That âPompey could not sleep on Pompey's Pillar.â Judge then the horror of the nigger's face To findâwith such impressions of that dire landâ That Case,âhis master,âwas a packing case For Ireland! He saw in fearful reveries arise, Phantasmagorias of those dreadful men Whose fame associate with Irish plots is, FitzgeraldsâTonesâO'ConnorsâHaresâand then âThose Emmets,â not so âlittle in his eyesâ As Doctor Watts's! He felt himself piked, roasted,âcarv'd and hack'd, His big black burly body seemed in fact A pincushion for Terror's pins and needles,â Oh, how he wish'd himself beneath the sun Of Africâor in far Barbadoesâone Of Bishop Coleridge's new black beadles. Full of this fright, With broken peace and broken English choking, As black as any raven and as croaking, Pompey rushed in upon his master's sight, Plump'd on his knees, and clasp'd his sable digits, Thus stirring Curiosity's sharp fidgetsâ âO Massa!âMassa!âColonel!âMassa Case!â Not go to Ireland!âIreland dam bad place; Dem take our bloodsâdem Irishâevery dropâ Oh why for Massa go so far a distance To have him life?ââHere Pompey made a stop, Putting an awful period to existence. âNot go to Irelandânot to Ireland, fellow, And murder'dâwhy should I be murder'd, Sirrah?â Cried Case, with anger's tinge upon his yellow,â Pompey, for answer, pointing in a mirror The Colonel's saffron, and his own japan,â âWell, what has that to doâquickâspeak outright, boy?â âO Massaââ(so the explanation ran) âMassa be killedâ'cause Massa Orange Man, And Pompey killedâ'cause Pompey not a White Boy!â THE CARELESSE NURSE MAYD I sawe a Mayd sitte on a Bank, Beguiled by Wooer fayne and fond; And whiles His flatterynge Vowes She drank, Her Nurselynge slipt within a Pond! All Even Tide they Talkde and Kist, For She was fayre and He was Kinde; The Sunne went down before She wist Another Sonne had sett behinde! With angrie Hands and frownynge Browe, That deemd Her owne the Urchine's Sinne, She pluckt Him out, but he was nowe Past being Whipt for fallynge in. She then beginnes to wayle the Ladde With Shrikes that Echo answerde roundâ O! foolishe Mayd to be soe sadde The Momente that her Care was drownd! TO FANNY âGay being, born to flutter.â âSale's Glee. Is this your faith, then, Fanny! What, to chat with every Dun! I'm the one, then, but of many, Not of many, but the One! Last night you smil'd on all, Ma'am, That appear'd in scarlet dress; And your Regimental Ball, Ma'am, Look'd a little like a Mess. I thought that of the Sogers (As the Scotch say) one might do, And that I, slight Ensign Rogers, Was the chosen man and true. But 'Sblood! your eye was busy With that ragamuffin mob;â Colonel BuddellâColonel Dizzyâ And Lieutenant-Colonel Cobb. General Joblin, General Jodkin, ColonelsâKelly, Felly, with MajorsâSturgeon, Truffle, Bodkin, And the Quarter-master Smith. Major PowderumâMajor Dowdrumâ Major ChowdrumâMajor Byeâ Captain TawneyâCaptain Fawney, Captain Any-oneâbut I! Deuce take it! when the regiment You so praised, I only thought That you lov'd it in abridgment, But I now am better taught! I went, as loving man goes, To admire thee in quadrilles; But Fan, you dance fandangoes With just any fop that wills! I went with notes before us, On the lay of Love to touch; But with all the Corps in chorus, Oh! it is indeed too much! You onceâere you contracted For the armyâseem'd my own; But now you laugh with all the Staff, And I may sigh alone!â I know not how it chances, When my passion ever dares, But the warmer my advances, Then the cooler are your airs. I am, I don't conceal it, But I am a little hurt; You're a Fan, and I must feel it, Fit for nothing but a Flirt! I dreamt thy smiles of beauty On myself alone did fall; But, alas! âCosi Fan Tutti!â It is thus, Fan, thus will all! You have taken quite a mob in Of new military flames;â They would make a fine Round Robin If I gave you all their names!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS, BY A POOR GENTLEMAN âThere, in a lonely room, from bailiffs snug, The Muse found Scroggins stretched beneath a rug.â âGoldsmith. STANZAS WRITTEN UNDER THE FEAR OF BAILIFFS Alas! of all the noxious things That wait upon the poor, Most cruel is that Felon-Fear That haunts the âDebtor's Door!â Saint Sepulchre's begins to toll, The Sheriffs seek the cell:â So I expect their officers, And tremble at the bell! I look for beer, and yet I quake With fright at every tap; And dread a double-knock, for oh! I've not a single rap! SONNET WRITTEN IN A WORKHOUSE Oh, blessed ease! no more of heaven I ask: The overseer is goneâthat vandal elfâ And hemp, unpick'd, may go and hang itself, While I, untask'd, except with Cowper's Task, In blessed literary leisure bask, And lose the workhouse, saving in the works Of Goldsmiths, Johnsons, Sheridans, and Burkes; Eat prose and drink of the Castalian flask; The themes of Locke, the anecdotes of Spence, The humorous of Gay, the Grave of Blairâ Unlearned toil, unletter'd labours hence! But, hark! I hear the master on the stairâ And Thomson's Castle, that of Indolence, Must be to me a castle in the air. SONNET.âA SOMNAMBULIST âA change came o'er the spirit of my dream.â âByron. Methoughtâfor Fancy is the strangest gadder When sleep all homely mundane ties hath rivenâ Methought that I ascended Jacob's ladder, With heartfelt hope of getting up to Heaven: Some bell, I know not whence, was sounding seven When I set foot upon that long one-pair; And still I climbed when it had chimed eleven, Nor yet of landing-place became aware; Step after step in endless flight seem'd there; But on, with steadfast hope, I struggled still, To gain that blessed haven from all care, Where tears are wiped, and hearts forget their ill, When, lo! I wakened on a sadder stairâ Trampâtrampâtrampâtrampâupon the Brixton Mill! FUGITIVE LINES ON PAWNING MY WATCH âAurum pot-a-bile: ââGold biles the pot. âFree translation. Farewell then, my golden repeater, We're come to my Uncle's old shop; And hunger won't be a dumb-waiter, The Cerberus growls for a sop! To quit thee, my comrade diurnal, My feelings will certainly scotch; But oh! there's a riot internal, And Famine calls out for the Watch. Oh! hunger's a terrible trial, I really must have a relief,â So here goes the plate of your dial To fetch me some Williams's beef! As famish'd as any lost seaman, I've fasted for many a dawn, And now must play chess with the Demon, And give it a check with a pawn. I've fasted, since dining at Buncle's, Two days with true Perceval zealâ And now must make up at my Uncle's, By getting a duplicate meal. No Peachum it is, or young Lockit, That rifles my fob with a snatch; Alas! I must pick my own pocket, And make gravy-soup of my watch! So long I have wander'd a starver I'm getting as keen as a hawk; Time's long hand must take up a carver, His short hand lay hold of a fork. Right heavy and sad the event is, But oh! it is Poverty's crime, I've been such a Brownrigg's Apprentice, I thus must be âout of my Time.â Alas! when in Brook Street the upper In comfort I lived between walls, I've gone to a dance for my supper, But now I must go to Three Balls! Folks talk about dressing for dinner, But I have for dinner undrest; Since Christmas, as I am a sinner, I've eaten a suit of my best. I haven't a rag or a mummock To fetch me a chop or a steak; I wish that the coats of my stomach Were such as my Uncle would take! When dishes were ready with garnish My watch used to warn with a chimeâ But now my repeater must furnish The dinner in lieu of the time! My craving will have no denials, I can't fob it off, if you stay, So go,âand the old Seven Dials Must tell me the time of the day. Your chimes I shall never more hear 'em, To part is a Tic Douloureux! But Tempus has his edax rerum, And I have my Feeding-Time too! Farewell then, my golden repeater, We're come to my Uncle's old shop, And Hunger won't be a dumb-waiter, The Cerberus growls for a sop. THE COMPASS, WITH VARIATIONS âThe Needles have sometimes been fatal to Mariners.â âPicture of Isle of Wight. One close of dayâ'twas in the bay Of Naples, bay of glory! While light was hanging crowns of gold On mountains high and hoary, A gallant bark got under weigh, And with her sails my story. For Leghorn she was bound direct, With wine and oil for cargo, Her crew of men, some nine or ten, The captain's name was Iago; A good and gallant bark she was, La Donna (call'd) del Lago. Bronzed mariners were hers to view, With brown cheeks, clear or muddy, Dark, shining eyes, and coal-black hair, Meet heads for painter's study; But 'midst their tan there stood one man Whose cheek was fair and ruddy; His brow was high, a loftier brow Ne'er shone in song or sonnet, His hair a little scant, and when He doff'd his cap or bonnet, One saw that Grey had gone beyond A premiership upon it! His eyeâa passenger was he, The cabin he had hired it,â His eye was grey, and when he look'd Around, the prospect fired itâ A fine poetic light, as if The Appe-Nine inspired it. His frame was stout, in height about Six feetâwell made and portly; Of dress and manner just to give A sketch, but very shortly, His order seem'd a composite Of rustic with the courtly. He ate and quaff'd, and joked and laugh'd, And chatted with the seamen, And often task'd their skill and ask'd, âWhat weather is't to be, man?â No demonstration there appear'd That he was any demon. No sort of sign there was that he Could raise a stormy rumpus, Like Prospero make breezes blow, And rocks and billows thump us,â But little we supposed what he Could with the needle compass! Soon came a stormâthe sea at first Seem'd lying almost fallowâ When lo! full crash, with billowy dash, From clouds of black and yellow, Came such a gale, as blows but once A cent'ry, like the aloe! Our stomachs we had just prepared To vest a small amount in; When, gush! a flood of brine came down The skylightâquite a fountain, And right on end the table rear'd, Just like the Table Mountain. Down rush'd the soup, down gush'd the wine, Each roll, its rÃ´le repeating, Roll'd downâthe round of beef declar'd For partingânot for meating! Off flew the fowls, and all the game Was âtoo far gone for eating!â Down knife and forkâdown went the pork, The lamb too broke its tether; Down mustard wentâeach condimentâ Saltâpepperâall together! Down every thing, like craft that seek The Downs in stormy weather. Down plunged the Lady of the Lake, Her timbers seem'd to sever; Down, down, a dreary derry down, Such lurch she had gone never; She almost seem'd about to take A bed of down for ever! Down dropt the captain's nether jaw, Thus robb'd of all its uses, He thought he saw the Evil One Beside Vesuvian sluices, Playing at dice for soul and ship, And throwing Sink and Deuces. Down fell the steward on his face, To all the Saints commending; And candles to the Virgin vow'd, As save-alls 'gainst his ending. Down fell the mate, he thought his fate, Check-mate, was close impending! Down fell the cookâthe cabin boy, Their heads with fervour telling, While alps of surge, with snowy verge, Above the yards came yelling. Down fell the crew, and on their knees Shudder'd at each white swelling! Down sunk the sun of bloody hue, His crimson light a cleaver To each red rover of a wave: To eye of fancy-weaver, Neptune, the God, seem'd tossing in A raging scarlet fever! Sore, sore afraid, each papist prayed To Saint and Virgin Mary; But one there was that stood composed Amid the waves' vagary: As staunch as rock, a true game cock 'Mid chicks of Mother Cary! His ruddy cheek retain'd its streak, No danger seem'd to shrink him; His step still bold,âof mortal mould The crew could hardly think him: The Lady of the Lake, he seem'd To know, could never sink him. Relax'd at last the furious gale Quite out of breath with racing; The boiling flood in milder mood, With gentler billows chasing; From stem to stern, with frequent turn, The Stranger took to pacing. And as he walk'd to self he talked, Some ancient ditty thrumming, In under tone, as not aloneâ Now whistling, and now hummingâ âYou're welcome, Charlie,â âCowden-knowes,â âKenmure,â or âCampbells' Coming.â Down went the wind, down went the wave, Fear quitted the most finical; The Saints, I wot, were soon forgot, And Hope was at the pinnacle; When rose on high, a frightful cryâ âThe Devil's in the binnacle!â âThe Saints be near,â the helmsman cried, His voice with quite a falterâ âSteady's my helm, but every look The needle seems to alter; God only knows where China lies, Jamaica, or Gibraltar!â The captain stared aghast at mate, The pilot at th'apprentice; No fancy of the German Sea Of Fiction the event is: But when they at the compass look'd, It seem'd non compass mentis. Now north, now south, now east, now west, The wavering point was shaken, 'Twas past the whole philosophy Of Newton, or of Bacon; Never by compass, till that hour, Such latitudes were taken! With fearful speech, each after each Took turns in the inspection; They found no gunâno ironânone To vary its direction; It seem'd a new magnetic case Of Poles in Insurrection! Farewell to wives, farewell their lives, And all their household riches; Oh! while they thought of girl or boy, And dear domestic niches, All down the side which holds the heart, That needle gave them stitches. With deep amaze, the Stranger gaz'd To see them so white-liver'd: And walk'd abaft the binnacle, To know at what they shiver'd: But when he stood beside the card, St. Josef! how it quiver'd! No fancy-motion, brain-begot In eye of timid dreamerâ The nervous finger of a sot Ne'er showed a plainer tremor; To every brain it seem'd too plain, There stood th'Infernal Schemer! Mix'd brown and blue each visage grew, Just like a pullet's gizzard; Meanwhile the captain's wandering wit, From tacking like an izzard, Bore down in this plain course at last, âIt's Michael Scottâthe Wizard!â A smile past o'er the ruddy face. âTo see the poles so falter I'm puzzled, friends, as much as you, For with no fiends I palter; Michael I'm notâalthough a Scottâ My Christian name is Walter.â Like oil it fell, that name, a spell On all the fearful faction; The captain's head (for he had read) Confess'd the Needle's action, And bow'd to Him in whom the North Has lodged its main attraction! PAIR'D, NOT MATCH'D Of wedded bliss Bards sing amiss, I cannot make a song of it; For I am small, My wife is tall, And that's the short and long of it; When we debate It is my fate To always have the wrong of it; For I am small And she is tall, And that's the short and long of it! And when I speak My voice is weak, But hersâshe makes a gong of it; For I am small, And she is tall, And that's the short and long of it; She has, in brief, Command in Chief, And I'm but Aide-de-camp of it; For I am small, And she is tall, And that's the short and long of it! She gives to me The weakest tea, And takes the whole Souchong of it; For I am small, And she is tall, And that's the short and long of it; She'll sometimes grip My buggy whip, And make me feel the thong of it; For I am small, And she is tall, And that's the short and long of it! Against my life She'll take a knife, Or fork, and dart the prong of it; For I am small, And she is tall, And that's the short and long of it! I sometimes think I'll take a drink, And hector when I'm strong of it; For I am small, And she is tall, And that's the short and long of it! O, if the bell Would ring her knell, I'd make a gay ding dong of it; For I am small, And she is tall, And that's the short and long of it! THE DUEL A SERIOUS BALLAD âLike the two Kings of Brentford smelling at one nosegay.â In Brentford town, of old renown, There lived a Mister Bray, Who fell in love with Lucy Bell, And so did Mr. Clay. To see her ride from Hammersmith, By all it was allow'd, Such fair outsides are seldom seen, Such Angels on a Cloud. Said Mr. Bray to Mr. Clay, You choose to rival me, And court Miss Bell, but there your court No thoroughfare shall be. Unless you now give up your suit, You may repent your love; I who have shot a pigeon match, Can shoot a turtle dove. So pray before you woo her more, Consider what you do; If you pop aught to Lucy Bell,â I'll pop it into you. Said Mr. Clay to Mr. Bray, Your threats I quite explode; One who has been a volunteer Knows how to prime and load. And so I say to you unless Your passion quiet keeps, I who have shot and hit bulls' eyes, May chance to hit a sheep's. Now gold is oft for silver changed, And that for copper red; But these two went away to give Each other change for lead. But first they sought a friend a-piece, This pleasant thought to giveâ When they were dead, they thus should have Two seconds still to live. To measure out the ground not long The seconds then forebore, And having taken one rash step, They took a dozen more. They next prepared each pistol-pan Against the deadly strife, By putting in the prime of death Against the prime of life. Now all was ready for the foes, But when they took their stands, Fear made them tremble so they found They both were shaking hands. Said Mr. C. to Mr. B., Here one of us may fall, And like St. Paul's Cathedral now, Be doom'd to have a ball. I do confess I did attach Misconduct to your name; If I withdraw the charge, will then Your ramrod do the same? Said Mr. B., I do agreeâ But think of Honour's Courts! If we go off without a shot, There will be strange reports. But look, the morning now is bright, Though cloudy it begun; Why can't we aim above, as if We had call'd out the sun? So up into the harmless air Their bullets they did send; And may all other duels have That upshot in the end! SONNET TO VAUXHALL The English Garden.â âMason.

There are too many of all trades Too many bakers, Too many every-thing-makers, But not too many undertakers,â Too many boys,â Too many hobby-de-hoys,â Too many girls, men, widows, wives, and maids,â There is a dreadful surplus to demolish, And yet some Wrongheads, With thick not long heads, Poor metaphysicians! Sign petitions Capital punishment to abolish; And in the face of censuses such vast ones New hospitals contrive, For keeping life alive, Laying first stones, the dolts! instead of last ones!â Others, again, in the same contrariety, Deem that of all Humane Society They really deserve thanks, Because the two banks of the Serpentine By their design, Are Saving Banks. Oh! were it given but to me to weed The human breed, And root out here and there some cumbering elf, I think I could go through it, And really do it With profit to the world and to myself,â For instance, the unkind among the Editors, My debtors, those I mean to say Who cannot or who will not pay, And all my creditors. These, for my own sake, I'd destroy; But for the world's, and every one's, I'd hoe up Mrs. G?'s two sons, And Mrs. B?'s big little boy, Call'd only by herself an âonly joy.â As Mr. Irving's chapel's not too full, Himself alone I'd pullâ But for the peace of years that have to run, I'd make the Lord Mayor's a perpetual station, And put a period to rotation, By rooting up all Aldermen but one,â These are but hints what good might thus be done! But ah! I fear the public good Is little by the public understood,â For instanceâif with flint, and steel, and tinder, Great Swing, for once a philanthropic man, Proposed to throw a light upon thy plan, No doubt some busy fool would hinder His burning all the Foundling to a cinder. Or, if the Lord Mayor, on an Easter Monday, That wine and bun-day, Proposed to poison all the little Bluecoats, Before they died by bit or sup, Some meddling Marplot would blow up, Just at the moment critical, The economy political Of saving their fresh yellow plush and new coats. Equally 'twould be undone, Suppose the Bishop of London, On that great day In June or May, When all the large small family of charity, Brown, black, or carroty, Walk in their dusty parish shoes, In too, too many two-and-twos, To sing together till they scare the walls Of old St. Paul's, Sitting in red, grey, green, blue, drab, and white, Some say a gratifying sight, Tho' I think sadâbut that's a schismâ To witness so much pauperismâ Suppose, I say, the Bishop then, to make In this poor overcrowded world more room, Proposed to shake Down that immense extinguisher, the domeâ Some humane Martin in the charity Gal-way I fear would come and interfere, Save beadle, brat, and overseer, To walk back in their parish shoes, In too, too many two-and-twos, IslingtonâWappingâor Pall Mall way! Thus, people hatch'd from goose's egg, Foolishly think a pest, a plague, And in its face their doors all shut, On hinges oil'd with cajeputâ Drugging themselves with drams well spiced and cloven, And turning pale as linen rags At hoisting up of yellow flags, While you and I are crying âOrange Boven!â Why should we let precautions so absorb us, Or trouble shipping with a quarantineâ When if I understand the thing you mean, We ought to import the Cholera Morbus! A GOOD DIRECTION A certain gentleman, whose yellow cheek Proclaimed he had not been in living quite An Anchoriteâ Indeed, he scarcely ever knew a well day; At last, by friends' advice, was led to seek A surgeon of great noteânamed Aberfeldie. A very famous Author upon Diet, Who, better starr'd than Alchemists of old, By dint of turning mercury to gold, Had settled at his country house in quiet. Our Patient, after some impatient rambles Thro' Enfield roads, and Enfield lanes of brambles, At last, to make inquiry had the nous,â âHere, my good man, Just tell me if you can, Pray which is Mr. Aberfeldie's house?â The man thus stopp'dâperusing for a while The yellow visage of the man of bile, At last made answer, with a broadish grin: âWhy, turn to rightâand leftâand right agin, The road's directâyou cannot fail to go it.â âBut stop!âmy worthy fellow!âone word moreâ From other houses how am I to know it?â âHow!âwhy, you'll see blue pillars at the door!â THERE'S NO ROMANCE IN THAT âSo while I fondly imagined we were deceiving my relations, and flattered myself that I should outwit and incense them all; behold, my hopes are to be crushed at once, by my aunt's consent and approbation, and I am myself the only dupe. But here, Sirâhere is the picture!â âLydia Languish. O days of old, O days of Knights, Of tourneys and of tilts, When love was balk'd and valour stalk'd On high heroic stiltsâ Where are ye gone?âadventures cease, The world gets tame and flat,â We've nothing now but New Policeâ There's no Romance in that! I wish I ne'er had learn'd to read, Or Radcliffe how to write; That Scott had been a boor on Tweed, And Lewis cloister'd quite! Would I had never drunk so deep Of dear Miss Porter's vat; I only turn to life, and weepâ There's no Romance in that! No Bandits lurkâno turban'd Turk To Tunis bears me offâ I hear no noises in the night Except my mother's cough,â No Bleeding Spectre haunts the house; No shape,âbut owl or bat, Come flitting after moth or mouseâ There's no Romance in that! I have not any grief profound, Or secrets to confess, My story would not fetch a pound For A. K. Newman's press; Instead of looking thin and pale, I'm growing red and fat, As if I lived on beef and aleâ There's no Romance in that! It's very hard, by land or sea Some strange event I court, But nothing ever comes to me That's worth a pen's report: It really made my temper chafe, Each coast that I was at, I vow'd and rail'd, and came home safe,â There's no Romance in that! The only time I had a chance, At Brighton one fine day, My chestnut mare began to prance, Took fright, and ran away; Alas! no Captain of the Tenth To stop my steed came pat; A Butcher caught the rein at lengthâ There's no Romance in that! Loveâeven loveâgoes smoothly on A railway sort of trackâ No flinty sire, no jealous Don! No hearts upon the rack; No Polydore, no Theodoreâ His ugly name is Mat, Plain Matthew Pratt and nothing moreâ There's no Romance in that! He is not dark, he is not tall,â His forehead's rather low, He is not pensiveânot at all, But smiles his teeth to show; He comes from Wales and yet in size Is really but a sprat; With sandy hair and greyish eyesâ There's no Romance in that! He wears no plumes or Spanish cloaks, Or long sword hanging down; He dresses much like other folks, And commonly in brown; His collar he will not discard, Or give up his cravat, Lord Byron-likeâhe's not a Bardâ There's no Romance in that! He's rather bald, his sight is weak, He's deaf in either drum; Without a lisp he cannot speak, But thenâhe's worth a plum. He talks of stocks and three per cents. By way of private chat, Of Spanish Bonds, and shares, and rents,â There's no Romance in that! I singâno matter what I sing, Di Tantiâor Crudel, Tom Bowling, or God save the King, Di piacerâAll's Well; He knows no more about a voice For singing than a gnatâ And as to Music âhas no choice,ââ There's no Romance in that! Of light guitar I cannot boast, He never serenades; He writes, and sends it by the post, He doesn't bribe the maids: No stealth, no hempen ladderâno! He comes with loud rat-tat, That startles half of Bedford Rowâ There's no Romance in that! He comes at nine in time to choose His coffeeâjust two cups, And talks with Pa about the news, Repeats debates, and sups, John helps him with his coat aright, And Jenkins hands his hat; My lover bows, and says good-nightâ There's no Romance in that! I've long had Pa's and Ma's consent, My aunt she quite approves, My Brother wishes joy from Kent, None try to thwart our loves; On Tuesday, reverend Mr. Mace Will make me Mrs. Pratt, Of Number Twenty, Sussex Placeâ There's no Romance in that. A WATERLOO BALLAD To Waterloo, with sad ado, And many a sigh and groan, Amongst the dead, came Patty Head To look for Peter Stone. âO prithee tell, good sentinel, If I shall find him here? I'm come to weep upon his corse, My Ninety-Second dear! âInto our town a serjeant came, With ribands all so fine A-flaunting in his capâalas! His bow enlisted mine! âThey taught him how to turn his toes, And stand as stiff as starch; I thought that it was love and May, But it was love and March! âA sorry March indeed to leave The friends he might have kepâ,â No March of Intellect it was, But quite a foolish step. âO prithee tell, good sentinel, If hereabout he lies? I want a corpse with reddish hair, And very sweet blue eyes.â Her sorrow on the sentinel Appear'd to deeply strike: âWalk in,â he said, âamong the dead, And pick out which you like.â And soon she pick'd out Peter Stone, Half turned into a corse; A cannon was his bolster, and His mattrass was a horse. âO Peter Stone, O Peter Stone, Lord, here has been a skrimmage! What have they done to your poor breast, That used to hold my image?â âO Patty Head, O Patty Head, You're come to my last kissing; Before I'm set in the Gazette As wounded, dead, and missing. âAlas! a splinter of a shell Right in my stomach sticks; French mortars don't agree so well With stomachs as French bricks. âThis very night a merry dance At Brussels was to be;â Instead of opening a ball, A ball has open'd me. âIts billet every bullet has, And well does it fulfil it;â I wish mine hadn't come so straight, But been a âcrooked billet.â âAnd then there came a cuirassier And cut me on the chest;â He had no pity in his heart, For he had steel'd his breast. âNext thing a lancer, with his lance Began to thrust away; I call'd for quarter, but, alas! It was not Quarter-day. âHe ran his spear right through my arm, Just here above the joint:â O Patty dear, it was no joke, Although it had a point. âWith loss of blood I fainted off As dead as women doâ But soon by charging over me, The Coldstreams brought me to. âWith kicks and cuts, and balls and blows, I throb and ache all over; I'm quite convinc'd the field of Mars Is not a field of clover! âO why did I a soldier turn, For any royal Guelph? I might have been a butcher, and In business for myself! âO why did I the bounty take? (And here he gasp'd for breath) My shillingsworth of 'list is nail'd Upon the door of death. âWithout a coffin I shall lie, And sleep my sleep eternal: Not ev'n a shellâmy only chance Of being made a Kernel! âO Patty dear, our wedding bells, Will never ring at Chester! Here I must lie in Honour's bed, That isn't worth a tester! âFarewell, my regimental mates, With whom I used to dress! My corps is changed, so I am now, In quite another mess. âFarewell, my Patty dear, I have No dying consolations, Except, when I am dead, you'll go And see th'Illuminations.â SHOOTING PAINS âThe charge is prepared.â âMacheath. If I shoot any more I'll be shot, For ill-luck seems determined to star me, I have march'd the whole day With a gun,âfor no payâ Zounds, I'd better have been in the army! What matters Sir Christopher's leave; To his manor I'm sorry I came yet! With confidence fraught, My two pointers I brought, But we are not a point towards game yet! And that gamekeeper too, with advice! Of my course he has been a nice chalker, Not far, were his words, I could go without birds: If my legs could cry out, they'd cry âWalker!â Not Hawker could find out a flaw,â My appointments are modern and Mantony, And I've brought my own man, To mark down all he can, But I can't find a mark for my Antony! The partridges,âwhere can they lie? I have promised a leash to Miss Jervas, As the least I could do; But without even two To brace me,âI'm getting quite nervous! To the pheasantsâhow well they're preserved! My sport's not a jot more beholden, As the birds are so shy, For my friends I must buy, And so send âsilver pheasants and golden.â I have tried ev'ry form for a hare, Every patch, every furze that could shroud her, With toil unrelax'd, Till my patience is tax'd, But I cannot be taxed for hare-powder. I've been roaming for hours in three flats In the hope of a snipe for a snap at; But still vainly I court The percussioning sport, I find nothing for âsetting my cap at!â A woodcock,âthis month is the time, Right and left I've made ready my lock for, With well-loaded double, But spite of my trouble, Neither barrel can I find a cock for! A rabbit I should not despise, But they lurk in their burrows so lowly; This day's the eleventh, It is not the seventh, But they seem to be keeping it hole-y. For a mallard I've waded the marsh, And haunted each pool, and each lakeâoh! Mine is not the luck, To obtain thee, O Duck, Or to doom thee, O Drake, like a Draco! For a field-fare I've fared far a-field, Large or small I am never to sack bird, Not a thrush is so kind As to fly, and I find I may whistle myself for a black-bird! I am angry, I'm hungry, I'm dry, Disappointed, and sullen, and goaded, And so weary an elf, I am sick of myself, And with Number One seem overloaded. As well one might beat round St. Paul's, And look out for a cock or a hen there; I have search'd round and round All the Baronet's ground, But Sir Christopher hasn't a wren there! Joyce may talk of his excellent caps, But for nightcaps they set me desiring, And it's really too bad, Not a shot I have had With Hall's Powder, renown'd for âquick firing.â If this is what people call sport, Oh! of sporting I can't have a high sense, And there still remains one More mischance on my gunâ âFined for shooting without any licence.â THE BOY AT THE NORE âAlone I did it!âBoy!â âCoriolanus. I say, little Boy at the Nore, Do you come from the small Isle of Man? Why, your history a mystery must be,â Come tell us as much as you can, Little Boy at the Nore! You live it seems wholly on water, Which your Gambier calls living in clover;â But how comes it, if that is the case, You're eternally half seas over,â Little Boy at the Nore? While you rideâwhile you danceâwhile you floatâ Never mind your imperfect orthography;â But give us as well as you can, Your watery auto-biography, Little Boy at the Nore! LITTLE BOY AT THE NORE LOQUITUR I'm the tight little Boy at the Nore, In a sort of sea negus I dwells; Half and half 'twixt salt water and Port,â I'm reckon'd the first of the swellsâ I'm the Boy at the Nore! I lives with my toes to the flounders, And watches through long days and nights; Yet, cruelly eager, men lookâ To catch the first glimpse of my lightsâ I'm the Boy at the Nore! I never gets cold in the head, So my life on salt water is sweet,â I think I owes much of my health To being well used to wet feetâ As the Boy at the Nore. There's one thing, I'm never in debt: Nay!âI liquidates more than I oughter A word caught from some American Trader in passing.; So the man to beat Cits as goes by, In keeping the head above water, Is the Boy at the Nore. I've seen a good deal of distress, Lots of Breakers in Ocean's Gazette; They should do as I doârise o'er all; Aye, a good floating capital get, Like the Boy at the Nore! I'm a'ter the sailor's own heart, And cheers him, in deep water rolling; And the friend of all friends to Jack Junk, Ben Backstay, Tom Pipes, and Tom Bowling, Is the Boy at the Nore! Could I e'er but grow up, I'd be off For a week to make love with my wheedles; If the tight little Boy at the Nore Could but catch a nice girl at the Needles, We'd have two at the Nore. They thinks little of sizes on water, On big waves the tiny one skulks,â While the river has Men of War on itâ Yesâthe Thames is oppress'd with Great Hulks, And the Boy's at the Nore! But I've doneâfor the water is heaving Round my body as though it would sink it! And I've been so long pitching and tossing, That sea-sickâyou'd hardly now think itâ Is the Boy at the Nore! ODE TO ST. SWITHIN âThe rain it raineth every day.â The Dawn is overcast, the morning low'rs, On ev'ry window-frame hang beaded damps Like rows of small illumination lamps To celebrate the Jubilee of Show'rs! A constant sprinkle patters from all leaves, The very Dryads are not dry, but soppers, And from the Houses' eaves Tumble eaves-droppers. The hundred clerks that live along the street, Bondsmen to mercantile and city schemers, With squashing, sloshing, and galloshing feet, Go paddling, paddling, through the wet, like steamers, Each hurrying to earn the daily stipendâ Umbrellas pass of every shade of green, And now and then a crimson one is seen. Like an Umbrella ripen'd. Over the way a waggon Stands with six smoking horses, shrinking, blinking, While in the George and Dragon The man is keeping himself dryâand drinking! The Butcher's boy skulks underneath his tray, Hats shineâshoes don'tâand down droop collars, And one blue Parasol cries all the way To school, in company with four small scholars! Unhappy is the man to-day who rides, Making his journey sloppier, not shorter; Aye, there they go, a dozen of outsides, Performing on âa Stage with real water!â A dripping Pauper crawls along the way, The only real willing out-of-doorer, And says, or seems to say, âWell, I am poor enoughâbut here's a pourer!â The scene in water colours thus I paint, Is your own Festival, you Sloppy Saint! Mother of all the Family of Rainers! Saint of the Soakers! Making all people croakers, Like frogs in swampy marshes, and complainers! And why you mizzle forty days together, Giving the earth your water-soup to sup, I marvelâWhy such wet, mysterious weather? I wish you'd clear it up! Why cast such cruel dampers On pretty Pic Nics, and against all wishes Set the cold ducks a-swimming in the hampers, And volunteer, unask'd, to wash the dishes? Why drive the Nymphs from the selected spot, To cling like lady-birds around a treeâ Why spoil a Gipsy party at their tea, By throwing your cold water upon hot? Cannot a rural maiden, or a man, Seek Hornsey-Wood by invitation, sipping Their green with Pan, But souse you come, and show their Pan all dripping! Why upon snow-white table-cloths and sheets, That do not wait, or want a second washing, Come squashing? Why task yourself to lay the dust in streets, As if there were no Water-Cart contractors, No pot-boys spilling beer, no shop-boys ruddy Spooning out puddles muddy, Milkmaids, and other slopping benefactors! A Queen you are, raining in your own right, Yet oh! how little flatter'd by report! Even by those that seek the Court, Pelted with every term of spleen and spite. Folks rail and swear at you in every place; They say you are a creature of no bowel; They say you're always washing Nature's face, And that you then supply her, With nothing drier, Than some old wringing cloud by way of towel! The whole town wants you duck'd, just as you duck it, They wish you on your own mud porridge supper'd, They hope that you may kick your own big bucket, Or in your water-butt go souse! heels up'ard! They are, in short, so weary of your drizzle, They'd spill the water in your veins to stop itâ Be warn'd! You are too partial to a mizzleâ Pray drop it! THE SCHOOLMASTER'S MOTTO âThe Admiral compelled them all to strike.â âLife of Nelson. Hush! silence in Schoolânot a noise! You shall soon see there's nothing to jeer at, Master Marsh, most audacious of boys! Come!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â So this morn in the midst of the Psalm, The Miss Siffkins's school you must leer at, You're complained ofâSir! hold out your palm,â There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â You wilful young rebel, and dunce! This offence all your sins shall appear at, You shall have a good caning at onceâ There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â You are backward, you know, in each verb, And your pronouns you are not more clear at, But you're forward enough to disturb,â There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â You said Master Twigg stole the plumbs, When the orchard he never was near at, I'll not punish wrong fingers or thumbs,â There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â You make Master Taylor your butt, And this morning his face you threw beer at, And you struck himâdo you like a cut? There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â Little Biddle you likewise distress, You are always his hair, or his ear atâ He's my Opt, Sir, and you are my Pess: There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â Then you had a pitcht fight with young Rous, An offence I am always severe at! You discredit to Cicero House! There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â You have made too a plot in the night, To run off from the school that you rear at! Come, your other hand, now, Sir,âthe right, There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â I'll teach you to draw, you young dog! Such pictures as I'm looking here at! âOld Mounseer making soup of a frog,â There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â You have run up a bill at a shop, That in paying you'll be a whole year at,â You've but twopence a week, Sir, to stop! There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â Then at dinner you're quite cock-a-hoop, And the soup you are certain to sneer atâ I have sipped itâit's very good soup,â There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â T'other day when I fell o'er the form, Was my tumble a thing, Sir, to cheer at? Well for you that my temper's not warm,â There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â Why, you rascal! you insolent brat! All my talking you don't shed a tear at, Thereâtake that, Sir! and that! that! and that! There!ââPalmam qui meruit ferat!â THE SUPPER SUPERSTITION A PATHETIC BALLAD Oh flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!â âMercutio. I 'Twas twelve o'clock by Chelsea chimes, When all in hungry trim, Good Mister Jupp sat down to sup With wife, and Kate, and Jim. II Said he, âUpon this dainty cod How bravely I shall supââ When, whiter than the table-cloth, A GHOST came rising up! III âO, father dear, O, mother dear, Dear Kate, and brother Jim,â You know when some one went to sea,â Don't cryâbut I am him! IV âYou hope some day with fond embrace To greet your absent Jack, But oh, I am come here to say I'm never coming back! V âFrom Alexandria we set sail, With corn, and oil, and figs, But steering âtoo much Sow,â we struck Upon the Sow and Pigs! VI âThe ship we pump'd till we could see Old England from the tops; When down she went with all our hands, Right in the Channel's Chops. VII âJust give a look in Norey's chart, The very place it tells; I think it says twelve fathom deep, Clay bottom, mix'd with shells. VIII âWell, there we are till âhands aloft,â We have at last a call; The pug I had for brother Jim, Kate's parrot, too, and all. IX âBut oh, my spirit cannot rest, In Davy Jones's sod, Till I've appear'd to you and said,â Don't sup on that 'ere Cod! X âYou live on land, and little think What passes in the sea; Last Sunday week, at 2 p.m., That Cod was picking me! XI âThose oysters, too, that look so plump, And seem so nicely done, They put my corpse in many shells, Instead of only one. XII âO, do not eat those oysters then, And do not touch the shrimps; When I was in my briny grave, They suck'd my blood like imps! XIII âDon't eat what brutes would never eat, The brutes I used to pat, They'll know the smell they used to smell, Just try the dog and cat!â XIV The Spirit fledâthey wept his fate, And cried, Alack, alack! At last up started brother Jim, âLet's try if Jack was Jack!â XV They call'd the Dog, they call'd the Cat, And little Kitten too, And down they put the Cod and sauce, To see what brutes would do. XVI Old Tray licked all the oysters up, Puss never stood at crimps, But munch'd the Codâand little Kit Quite feasted on the shrimps! XVII The thing was odd, and minus Cod And sauce, they stood like posts; O, prudent folks, for fear of hoax, Put no belief in Ghosts! A STORM AT HASTINGS AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN 'Twas AugustâHastings every day was fillingâ Hastings, that âgreenest spot on memory's waste!â With crowds of idlers willing or unwilling To be bedippedâbe noticedâor be braced, And all things rose a penny in a shilling. Meanwhile, from window and from door, in haste âAccommodation billsâ kept coming down, Gladding âthe world of lettersâ in that town. Each day pour'd in new coach-fulls of new cits, Flying from London smoke and dust annoying, Unmarried Misses hoping to make hits, And new-wed couples fresh from Tunbridge toying. Lacemen and placemen, ministers and wits, And quakers of both sexes, much enjoying A morning's reading by the ocean's rim, That sect delighting in the sea's broad brim. And lo! amongst all these appear'd a creature, So small, he almost might a twin have been With Miss Crachamiâdwarfish quite in stature, Yet well proportion'dâneither fat nor lean, His face of marvellously pleasant feature, So short and sweet a man was never seenâ All thought him charming at the first beginningâ Alas, ere long they found him far too winning! He seem'd in love with chanceâand chance repaid His ardent passion with her fondest smile, The sunshine of good luck, without a shade, He staked and wonâand won and stakedâthe bile It stirr'd of many a man and many a maid, To see at every venture how that vile Small gambler snatch'dâand how he won them tooâ A living Pam, omnipotent at loo! Miss Wiggins set her heart upon a box, 'Twas handsome, rosewood, and inlaid with brass, And dreamt three times she garnish'd it with stocks Of needles, silks, and cottonsâbut alas! She lost it wide awake.âWe thought Miss Cox Was luckyâbut she saw three caddies pass To that small imp;âno living luck could loo him! Sir Stamford would have lost his Raffles to him! And so he climb'dâand rode, and wonâand walk'd, The wondrous topic of the curious swarm That haunted the Parade. Many were balk'd Of notoriety by that small form Pacing it up and down:âsome even talk'd Of ducking himâwhen lo! a dismal storm Stepp'd inâone Friday, at the close of dayâ And every head was turn'd another wayâ Watching the grander guest. It seem'd to rise Bulky and slow upon the southern brink Of the horizonâfann'd by sultry sighsâ So black and threatening, I cannot think Of any simile, except the skies Miss Wiggins sometimes shades in Indian inkâ Miss-shapen blotches of such heavy vapour, They seem a deal more solid than her paper. As for the sea, it did not fret, and rave, And tear its waves to tatters, and so dash on The stony-hearted beach;âsome bards would have It always rampant, in that idle fashion,â Whereas the waves roll'd in, subdued and grave, Like schoolboys, when the master's in a passion, Who meekly settle in and take their places, With a very quiet awe on all their faces. Some love to draw the ocean with a head, Like troubled table-beer,âand make it bounce, And froth, and roar, and fling,âbut this, I've said, Surged in scarce rougher than a lady's flounce:â But then, a grander contrast thus it bred With the wild welkin, seeming to pronounce Something more awful in the serious ear, As one would whisper that a lion's nearâ Who just begins to roar: so the hoarse thunder Growl'd longâbut lowâa prelude note of death, As if the stifling clouds yet kept it under, But still it mutter'd to the sea beneath Such a continued peal, as made us wonder It did not pause more oft to take its breath, Whilst we were panting with the sultry weather, And hardly cared to wed two words together, But watch'd the surly advent of the storm, Much as the brown-cheek'd planters of Barbadoes Must watch a rising of the Negro swarm:â Meantime it steer'd, like Odin's old Armadas, Right on our coast;âa dismal, coal-black form;â Many proud gaits were quell'dâand all bravadoes Of folly ceasedâand sundry idle jokers Went home to cover up their tongs and pokers. So fierce the lightning flashed.âIn all their days The oldest smugglers had not seen such flashing, And they are used to many a pretty blaze, To keep their Hollands from an awkward clashing With hostile cutters in our creeks and bays:â And truly one could think without much lashing The fancy, that those coasting clouds so awful And black, were fraught with spirits as unlawful. The gay Parade grew thinâall the fair crowd Vanish'dâas if they knew their own attractions,â For now the lightning through a near hand cloud Began to make some very crooked fractionsâ Only some few remain'd that were not cow'd, A few rough sailors, who had been in actions, And sundry boatmen, that with quick yeo's, Lest it should blow,âwere pulling up the Rose: (No flower, but a boat)âsome more were hauling The Regent by the head:âanother crew With that same cry peculiar to their callingâ Were heaving up the Hope:âand as they knew The very gods themselves oft get a mauling In their own realms, the seamen wisely drew The Neptune rather higher on the beach, That he might lie beyond his billows' reach. And now the storm, with its despotic power, Had all usurp'd the azure of the skies, Making our daylight darker by an hour, And some few dropsâof an unusual sizeâ Few and distinctâscarce twenty to the shower, Fell like huge tear-drops from a Giant's eyesâ But then this sprinkle thicken'd in a trice And rain'd much harderâin good solid ice. Oh! for a very storm of words to show How this fierce crash of hail came rushing o'er us! Handel would make the gusty organs blow Grandly, and a rich storm in music score us;â But ev'n his music seem'd composed and low, When we were handled by this Hailstone Chorus; Whilst thunder rumbled, with its awful sound, And frozen comfits roll'd along the groundâ As big as bullets:âLord! how they did batter Our crazy tiles:âAnd now the lightning flash'd Alternate with the dark, until the latter Was rarest of the two:âthe gust too dash'd So terribly, I thought the hail must shatter Some panes,âand so it didâand first it smash'd The very square where I had chose my station To watch the general illumination. Another, and another, still came in, And fell in jingling ruin at my feet, Making transparent holes that let me win Some samples of the storm:âOh! it was sweet To think I had a shelter for my skin, Culling them through these âloopholes of retreatââ Which in a little we began to glazeâ Chiefly with a jacktowel and some baize! By which, the cloud had pass'd o'erhead, but play'd Its crooked fires in constant flashes still, Just in our rear, as though it had array'd Its heavy batteries at Fairlight Mill, So that it lit the town, and grandly made The rugged features of the Castle Hill Leap, like a birth, from chaos, into light, And then relapse into the gloomy nightâ As parcel of the cloud:âthe clouds themselves, Like monstrous crags and summits everlasting, Piled each on each in most gigantic shelves, That Milton's devils were engaged in blasting.â We could e'en fancy Satan and his elves Busy upon those crags, and ever casting Huge fragments loose,âand that we felt the sound They made in falling to the startled ground. And so the tempest scowl'd away,âand soon Timidly shining through its skirts of jet, We saw the rim of the pacific moon, Like a bright fish entangled in a net, Flashing its silver sides,âhow sweet a boon, Seemed her sweet light, as though it would beget, With that fair smile, a calm upon the seasâ Peace in the skyâand coolness in the breeze! Meantime the hail had ceased:âand all the brood Of glaziers stole abroad to count their gains;â At every window, there were maids who stood Lamenting o'er the glass's small remains,â Or with coarse linens made the fractions good, Stanching the wind in all the wounded panes,â Or, holding candles to the panes, in doubt: The wind resolvedâblowing the candles out. No house was whole that had a southern front,â No green-house but the same mishap befell;â Bow-windows and bell-glasses bore the brunt,â No sex in glass was spared!âFor those who dwell On each hill side, you might have swum a punt In any of their parlours;âMrs. Snell Was slopp'd out of her seat,âand Mr. Hitchin Had a flow'r-garden wash'd into a Kitchen. But still the sea was mild, and quite disclaim'd The recent violence.âEach after each The gentle waves a gentle murmur framed, Tapping, like Woodpeckers, the hollow beach. Howbeit his weather eye the seaman aim'd Across the calm, and hinted by his speech A gale next morningâand when morning broke, There was a galeââquite equal to bespoke.â Before high waterâ(it were better far To christen it not water then, but waiter, For then the tide is serving at the bar) Rose such a swellâI never saw one greater! Black, jagged billows rearing up in war Like ragged roaring bears against the baiter, With lots of froth upon the shingle shed, Like stout poured out with a fine beachy head. No open boat was open to a fare, Or launch'd that morn on seven-shilling trips, No bathing woman wadedânone would dare A dipping in the waveâbut waived their dips, No seagull ventured on the stormy air, And all the dreary coast was clear of ships; For two lea shores upon the river Lea Are not so perilous as one at sea. Awe-struck we sat, and gazed upon the scene Before us in such horrid hurly-burly,â A boiling ocean of mix'd black and green, A sky of copper colour, grim and surly,â When lo, in that vast hollow scoop'd between Two rolling Alps of water,âwhite and curly! We saw a pair of little arms a-skimming, Much like a first or last attempt at swimming! Sometimes a handâsometimes a little shoeâ Sometimes a skirtâsometimes a hank of hair Just like a dabbled seaweed rose to view, Sometimes a knee, sometimes a back was bareâ At last a frightful summerset he threw Right on the shingles. Any one could swear The lad was deadâwithout a chance of perjury, And batter'd by the surge beyond all surgery! However we snatch'd up the corse thus thrown, Intending, Christian-like, to sod and turf it, And after venting Pity's sigh and groan, Then Curiosity began with her fit; And lo! the features of the Small Unknown! 'Twas he that of the surf had had this surfeit!â And in his fob, the cause of late monopolies, We found a contract signed with Mephistopheles. A bond of blood, whereby the sinner gave His forfeit soul to Satan in reversion, Providing in this world he was to have A lordship over luck, by whose exertion He might control the course of cards, and brave All throws of dice,âbut on a sea excursion The juggling Demon, in his usual vein, Seized the last castâand Nick'd him in the main! LINES TO A LADY ON HER DEPARTURE FOR INDIA Go where the waves run rather Holborn-hilly, And tempests make a soda-water sea, Almost as rough as our rough Piccadilly, And think of me! Go where the mild Madeira ripens her juice,â A wine more praised than it deserves to be! Go pass the Cape, just capable of ver-juice, And think of me! Go where the Tiger in the darkness prowleth, Making a midnight meal of he and she; Go where the Lion in his hunger howleth, And think of me! Go where the serpent dangerously coileth, Or lies along at full length like a tree, Go where the Suttee in her own soot broileth, And think of me! Go where with human notes the Parrot dealeth In mono-polly-logue with tongue as free, And like a woman, all she can revealeth, And think of me! Go to the land of muslin and nankeening, And parasols of straw where hats should be, Go to the land of slaves and palankeening, And think of me! Go to the land of Jungles and of vast hills, And tall bamboosâmay none bamboozle thee! Go gaze upon their Elephants and Castles, And think of me! Go where a cook must always be a currier, And parch the pepper'd palate like a pea, Go where the fierce musquito is a worrier, And think of me! Go where the maiden on a marriage plan goes, Consign'd for wedlock to Calcutta's quay, Where woman goes for mart, the same as mangoes, And think of me! Go where the sun is very hot and fervent, Go to the land of pagod and rupee, Where every black will be your slave and servant, And think of me! SONNET TO A SCOTCH GIRL, WASHING LINEN AFTER HER COUNTRY FASHION Well done and wetly, thou Fair Maid of Perth. Thou mak'st a washing picture well deserving The pen and pencilling of Washington Irving: Like dripping Naiad, pearly from her birth, Dashing about the water of the Firth, To cleanse the calico of Mrs. Skirving, And never from thy dance of duty swervingâ As there were nothing else than dirt on earth! Yet what is thy reward? Nay, do not start! I do not mean to give thee a new damper, But while thou fillest this industrious part Of washer, wearer, mangler, presser, stamper, Deserving better characterâthou art What Bodkin would but callââa common tramper.â SONNET TO A DECAYED SEAMAN Hail! seventy-four cut down! Hail, Top and Lop: Unless I'm much mistaken in my notion, Thou wast a stirring Tar, before that hop Became so fatal to thy locomotion;â Now, thrown on shore, like a mere weed of ocean, Thou readest still to men a lesson good, To King and Country showing thy devotion, By kneeling thus upon a stump of wood! Still is thy spirit strong as alcohol; Spite of that limb, begot of acorn-egg,â Methinks,âthou Naval History in one Vol.â A virtue shines, e'en in that timber leg, For unlike others that desert their Poll, Thou walkest ever with thy âConstant Peg!â HUGGINS AND DUGGINS A PASTORAL AFTER POPE Two swains or clownsâbut call them swainsâ While keeping flocks on Salisbury Plains, For all that tend on sheep as drovers, Are turned to songsters, or to lovers, Each of the lass he call'd his dear Began to carol loud and clear. First Huggins sang, and Duggins then, In the way of ancient shepherd men; Who thus alternate hitch'd in song, âAll things by turns, and nothing long.â HUGGINS. Of all the girls about our place, There's one beats all in form and face; Search through all Great and Little Bumpstead You'll only find one Peggy Plumstead. DUGGINS. To groves and streams I tell my flame; I make the cliffs repeat her name: When I'm inspired by gills and noggins, The rocks re-echo Sally Hoggins! HUGGINS. When I am walking in the grove, I think of Peggy as I rove. I'd carve her name on every tree, But I don't know my A, B, C. DUGGINS. Whether I walk in hill or valley, I think of nothing else but Sally. I'd sing her praise, but I can sing No song, except âGod save the King.â HUGGINS. My Peggy does all nymphs excel, And all confess she bears the bell,â Where'er she goes swains flock together, Like sheep that follow the bellwether. DUGGINS. Sally is tall and not too straight,â Those very poplar shapes I hate; But something twisted like an S,â A crook becomes a shepherdess. HUGGINS. When Peggy's dog her arms emprison, I often wish my lot was hisn; How often I should stand and turn, To get a pat from hands like hern. DUGGINS. I tell Sall's lambs how blest they be, To stand about and stare at she; But when I look, she turns and shies, And won't bear none but their sheep's-eyes! HUGGINS. Love goes with Peggy where she goes,â Beneath her smile the garden grows; Potatoes spring, and cabbage starts, 'Tatoes have eyes, and cabbage hearts! DUGGINS. Where Sally goes it's always Spring, Her presence brightens every-thing; The sun smiles bright, but where her grin is, It makes brass farthings look like guineas. HUGGINS. For Peggy I can have no joy, She's sometimes kind, and sometimes coy, And keeps me, by her wayward tricks, As comfortless as sheep with ticks. DUGGINS. Sally is ripe as June or May, And yet as cold as Christmas day; For when she's asked to change her lot, Lamb's wool,âbut Sally, she wool not. HUGGINS. Only with Peggy and with health, I'd never wish for state or wealth; Talking of having health and more pence, I'd drink her health if I had fourpence. DUGGINS. Oh, how that day would seem to shine, If Sally's banns were read with mine; She cries, when such a wish I carry, âMarry come up!â but will not marry. DOMESTIC DIDACTICS BY AN OLD SERVANT THE BROKEN DISH What's life but full of care and doubt, With all its fine humanities, With parasols we walk about, Long pigtails and such vanities. We plant pomegranate trees and things, And go in gardens sporting, With toys and fans of peacock's wings To painted ladies courting. We gather flowers of every hue, And fish in boats for fishes, Build summer-houses painted blue,â But life's as frail as dishes. Walking about their groves of trees, Blue bridges and blue rivers, How little thought them two Chinese, They'd both be smash'd to shivers! ODE TO PEACE WRITTEN ON THE NIGHT OF MY MISTRESS'S GRAND ROUT Oh Peace! oh come with me and dwellâ But stop, for there's the bell. Oh Peace! for thee I go and sit in churches, On Wednesday, when there's very few In loft or pewâ Another ring, the tarts are come from Birch's. Oh Peace! for thee I have avoided marriageâ Hush! there's a carriage. Oh Peace! thou art the best of earthly goodsâ The five Miss Woods. Oh Peace! thou art the Goddess I adoreâ There come some more. Oh Peace! thou child of solitude and quietâ That's Lord Drum's footman, for he loves a riot. Oh Peace! Knocks will not cease. Oh Peace! thou wert for human comfort plann'dâ That's Weippert's band. Oh Peace! how glad I welcome thy approachesâ I hear the sound of coaches. Oh Peace! oh Peace!âanother carriage stopsâ It's early for the Blenkinsops. Oh Peace! with thee I love to wander, But wait till I have show'd up Lady Squander; And now I've seen her up the stair, Oh Peace!âbut here comes Captain Hare. Oh Peace! thou art the slumber of the mind, Untroubled, calm and quiet, and unbroken,â If that is Alderman Guzzle from Portsoken, Alderman Gobble won't be far behind. Oh Peace! serene in worldly shyness,â Make way there for his Serene Highness! Oh Peace! if you do not disdain To dwell amongst the menial train, I have a silent place, and lone, That you and I may call our own; Where tumult never makes an entryâ Susan, what business have you in my pantry? Oh Peace! but there is Major Monk, At variance with his wifeâOh Peace! And that great German, Vander Trunk, And that great talker, Miss Apreece; Oh Peace! so dear to poet's quillsâ They're just beginning their quadrillesâ Oh Peace! our greatest renovator;â I wonder where I put my waiterâ Oh Peace!âbut here my Ode I'll cease; I have no peace to write of Peace. A FEW LINES ON COMPLETING FORTY-SEVEN When I reflect, with serious sense, While years and years run on, How soon I may be summon'd henceâ There's cook a-calling John. Our lives are built so frail and poor, On sand and not on rocks, We're hourly standing at Death's doorâ There's some one double-knocks. All human days have settled terms, Our fates we cannot force; This flesh of mine will feed the wormsâ They're come to lunch of course. And when my body's turn'd to clay, And dear friends hear my knell, Oh, let them give a sigh and sayâ I hear the upstairs bell. TO MARY HOUSEMAID ON VALENTINE'S DAY Mary, you know I've no love-nonsense, And, though I pen on such a day, I don't mean flirting, on my conscience, Or writing in the courting way. Though Beauty hasn't form'd your feature, It saves you, p'rhaps, from being vain, And many a poor unhappy creature May wish that she was half as plain. Your virtues would not rise an inch, Although your shape was two foot taller, And wisely you let others pinch Great waists and feet to make them smaller. You never try to spare your hands From getting red by household duty, But, doing all that it commands, Their coarseness is a moral beauty. Let Susan flourish her fair arms, And at your odd legs sneer and scoff; But let her laugh, for you have charms That nobody knows nothing of.

LITERARY AND LITERAL The March of Mind upon its mighty stilts, (A spirit by no means to fasten mocks on,) In travelling through Berks, Beds, Notts, and Wilts, HantsâBucks, Herts, Oxon, Got up a thing our ancestors ne'er thought on, A thing that, only in our proper youth, We should have chuckled atâin sober truth A Conversazione at Hog's Norton!

It chanced one Friday, One Farmer Grayley stuck a very big hog, A perfect Gog or Magog of a pig-hog, Which made of course a literary high day,â Not that our Farmer was a man to go With literary tastesâso far from suiting 'em, When he heard mention of Professor Crowe, Or Lalla-Rookh, he always was for shooting 'em! In fact in letters he was quite a log, With him great Bacon Was literally taken, And Hoggâthe Poetânothing but a Hog! As to all others on the list of Fame, Although they were discuss'd and mention'd daily, He only recognised one classic name, And thought that she had hung herselfâMiss Baillie! To balance this, our Farmer's only daughter Had a great taste for the Castalian waterâ A Wordsworth worshipperâa Southey wooerâ (Though men that deal in water-colour cakes May disbelieve the factâyet nothing's truer) She got the bluer The more she dipped and dabbled in the Lakes.

Of learning's laurelsâMiss Joanna Baillieâ Of Mrs. HemansâMrs. Wilsonâdaily Dreamt Anne Priscilla Isabella Grayley; And Fancy hinting that she had the better Of L. E. L. by one initial letter, She thought the world would quite enraptur'd see âLove Lays and Lyrics BY A.P.I.G.â Accordingly, with very great propriety, She joined the H. N. B. and double S., That is,âHog's Norton Blue Stocking Society; And saving when her Pa his pigs prohibited, Contributed Her pork and poetry towards the mess. This feast, we said, one Friday was the case, When farmer Grayleyâfrom Macbeth to quoteâ Screwing his courage to the âsticking place,â Stuck a large knife into a grunter's throat:â A kind of murder that the law's rebuke Seldom condemns by shake of its peruke, Showing the little sympathy of big-wigs With pig-wigs! The swineâpoor wretch!âwith nobody to speak for it, And beg its life, resolved to have a squeak for it; Soâlike the fabled swanâdied singing out, And, thus, there issued from the farmer's yard A note that notified without a card, An invitation to the evening rout. And when the time came duly,ââAt the close of The day,â as Beattie has it, âwhen the hamââ Bacon, and pork were ready to dispose of, And pettitoes and chit'lings too, to cram,â Walked in the H.

The Members all assembled thus, a rare woman At pork and poetry was chosen chairwoman;â In fact, the bluest of the Blues, Miss Ikey, Whose whole pronunciation was so piggy, She always named the authoress of âPsycheââ As Mrs. Tiggey! And now arose a question of some moment,â What author for a lecture was the richer, Bacon or Hogg? there were no votes for Beaumont, But some for Flitcher; While others, with a more sagacious reasoning, Proposed another work, And thought their pork Would prove more relishing from Thomson's Season-ing! But, practised in Shakspearian readings daily,â O! Miss Macaulay! Shakspeare at Hog's Norton!â Miss Anne Priscilla Isabella Grayley Selected him that evening to snort on. In short, to make our story not a big tale, Just fancy her exerting Her talents, and converting The Winter's Tale to something like a pig-tale! Her sister auditory, All sitting round, with grave and learned faces, Were very plauditory, Of course, and clapped her at the proper places; Till fanned at once by fortune and the Muse, She thought herself the blessedest of Blues. But Happiness, alas! has blights of ill, And Pleasure's bubbles in the air explode;â There is no travelling through life but still The heart will meet with breakers on the road!

What Pens were sliced, hew'd, hack'd, and haggled out, Slit or unslit, with many a various snout, Aquiline, Roman, crooked, square, and snubby, Stumpy and stubby; Some capable of ladye-billets neat, Some only fit for Ledger-keeping Clerk, And some to grub down Peter Stubbs his mark, Or smudge through some illegible receipt; Others in florid caligraphic plans, Equal to Ships, and wiggy Heads, and Swans! V To try in any common inkstands, then, With all their miscellaneous stocks, To find a decent pen, Was like a dip into a lucky box: You drew,âand got one very curly, And split like endive in some hurly-burly; The next, unslit, and square at end, a spade; The third, incipient pop-gun, not yet made; The fourth a broom; the fifth of no avail, Turn'd upwards, like a rabbit's tail; And last, not least, by way of a relief, A stump that Master Richard, James, or John, Had tried his candle-cookery upon, Making âroast-beef!â VI Not so thy Perryan Pens! True to their M's and N's, They do not with a wizzing zig-zag split, Straddle, turn up their noses, sulk, and spit, Or drop large dots, Huge fullstop blots, Where even semicolons were unfit. They will not frizzle up, or, broomlike, drudge In sable sludgeâ Nay, bought at proper âPatent Perryanâ shops, They write good grammar, sense, and mind their stops; Compose both prose and verse, the sad or merryâ For when the Editor, whose pains compile The grown-up Annual, or the Juvenile, Vaunteth his articles, not women's, men's, But lays âby the most celebrated Pens,â What means he but thy Patent Pens, my Perry? VII Pleasant they are to feel! So firm! so flexible! composed of steel So finely temper'dâfit for tenderest Miss To give her passion breath, Or Kings to sign the warrant stern of deathâ But their supremest merit still is this, Write with them all your days, Tragedy, Comedy, all kinds of playsâ (No Dramatist should ever be without 'em)â And, just conceive the bliss,â There is so little of the goose about 'em, One's safe from any hiss! VIII Ah! who can paint that first great awful night, Big with a blessing or a blight, When the poor Dramatist, all fume and fret, Fuss, fidget, fancy, fever, funking, fright, Ferment, fault-fearing, faintnessâmore f's yet: Flush'd, frigid, flurried, flinching, fitful, flat,â Add famish'd, fuddled, and fatigued, to that; Funeral, fate-forebodingâsits in doubt, Or rather doubt with hope, a wretched marriage, To see his Play upon the stage come out; No stage to him! it is Thalia's carriage, And he is sitting on the spikes behind it, Striving to look as if he didn't mind it! IX Witness how Beazley vents upon his hat His nervousness, meanwhile his fate is dealt: He kneads, moulds, pummels it, and sits it flat, Squeezes and twists it up, until the felt That went a Beaver in, comes out a Rat! Miss Mitford had mis-givings, and in fright, Upon Rienzi's night, Gnaw'd up one long kid glove, and all her bag, Quite to a rag. Knowles has confess'd he trembled as for life, Afraid of his own âWife;â Poole told me that he felt a monstrous pail Of water backing him, all down his spine,â âThe ice-brook's temperââpleasant to the chine!â For fear that Simpson and his Co. should fail. Did Lord Glengall not frame a mental pray'r, Wishing devoutly he was Lord knows-where? Nay, did not Jerrold, in enormous drouth, While doubtful of Nell Gwynne's eventful luck, Squeeze out and suck More oranges with his one fevered mouth, Than Nelly had to hawk from North to South? Yea, Buckstone, changing colour like a mullet, Refused, on an occasion, once, twice, thrice, From his best friend, an ice, Lest it should hiss in his own red-hot gullet. X Doth punning Peake not sit upon the points Of his own jokes, and shake in all his joints, During their trial? 'Tis past denial. And does not Pocock, feeling, like a peacock, All eyes upon him turn to very meacock? And does not PlanchÃ©, tremulous and blank, Meanwhile his personages tread the boards, Seem goaded by sharp swords, And call'd upon himself to âwalk the plankâ? As for the Dances, Charles and George to boot What have they more Of ease and rest, for sole of either foot, Than bear that capers on a hotted floor? XI Thus pendingâdoes not Mathews, at sad shift For voice, croak like a frog in waters fenny?â Serle seem upon the surly seas adrift? And Kenny think he's going to Kilkenny?â Haynes Bayly feel Old ditto, with the note Of Cotton in his ear, a mortal grapple About his arms, and Adam's apple Big as a fine Dutch codling in his throat? Did Rodwell, on his chimney-piece, desire Or not to take a jump into the fire? Did Wade feel as composed as music can? And was not Bernard his own Nervous Man? Lastly, don't Farley, a bewildered elf, Quake at the Pantomime he loves to cater, And ere its changes ring, transform himself?â A frightful mug of human delf? A spirit-bottleâempty of âthe craturâ? A leaden-platter ready for the shelf? A thunderstruck dumb-waiter? XII To clench the fact, Myself, once guilty, of one small rash act, Committed at the Surrey Quite in a hurry, Felt all this flurry, Corporal worry, And spiritual scurry, Dram-devilâattic curry! All going well, From prompter's bell, Until befel A hissing at some dull imperfect dunceâ There's no denying, I felt in all four elements at once! My head was swimming, while my arms were flying, My legs for runningâall the rest was frying! XIII Thrice welcome, then, for this peculiar use Thy pens so innocent of goose! For this shall Dramatists, when they make merry, Discarding Port and Sherry, DrinkââPerry!â Perry, whose fame, pennated, is let loose To distant lands, Perry, admitted on all hands, Text, running, German, Roman, For Patent Perryans approach'd by no man! And when, ah me! far distant be the hour! Pluto shall call thee to his gloomy bow'r, Many shall be thy pensive mourners, many! And Penury itself shall club its penny, To raise thy monument in lofty place; Higher than York's, or any son of War; Whilst Time all meaner effigies shall bury, On due pentagonal base, Shall stand the Parian, Perryan, perriwig'd Perry, Perch'd on the proudest peak of Penman Mawr! THE UNDYING ONE âHe shall not die.â âUncle Toby. I Of all the verses, grave or gay, That ever wiled an hour, I never knew a mingled lay At once so sweet and sour, As that by Ladye Norton spun, And christen'd âThe Undying One.â II I'm very certain that she drew A portrait, when she penn'd That picture of a perfect Jew, Whose days will never end: I'm sure it means my Uncle Lunn, For he is an Undying One. III These twenty years he's been the same And may be twenty more; But Memory's Pleasures only claim His features for a score; Yet in that time the change is noneâ The image of th'Undying One! IV They say our climate's damp and cold, And lungs are tender things; My uncle's much abroad and old, But when âKing Coleâ he sings, A Stentor's voice, enough to stun, Declares him an Undying One. V Others have died from needle-pricks, And very slender blows; From accidental slips or kicks, Or bleedings at the nose; Or choked by grape-stone, or a bunâ But he is the Undying One! VI A soldier once, he once endur'd A bullet in the breastâ It might have kill'dâbut only cured An asthma in the chest; He was not to be slain with gun, For he is the Undying One. VII In water once too long he dived, And all supposed him beat, He seem'd so coldâbut he revived To have another heat, Just when we thought his race was run, And came in freshâth'Undying One! VIII To look at Meux's once he went, And tumbled in the vatâ And greater Jobs their lives have spent In lesser boils than that,â He left the beer quite underdone, No bier to the Undying One! IX He's been from strangulation black, From bile, of yellow hue, Scarlet from fever's hot attack, From cholera morbus blue; Yet with these dyesâto use a punâ He still is the Undying One. X He rolls in wealth, yet has no wife His Three per Cents. to share; He never married in his life, Or flirted with the fair; The sex he made a point to shun, For beauty an Undying One. XI To judge him by the present signs, The future by the past, So quick he lives, so slow declines, The Last Man won't be last, But buried underneath a ton Of mould by the Undying One! XII Next Friday week, his birth-day boast, His ninetieth year he spends, And I shall have his health to toast Amongst expectant friends, And wishâit really sounds like funâ Long life to the Undying One! COCKLE v. CACKLE Those who much read advertisements and bills, Must have seen puffs of Cockle's Pills, Call'd Anti-biliousâ Which some Physicians sneer at, supercilious, But which we are assured, if timely taken, May save your liver and bacon; Whether or not they really give one ease, I, who have never tried, Will not decide; But no two things in union go like theseâ Viz.âQuacks and Pillsâsave Ducks and Pease. Now Mrs. W. was getting sallow, Her lilies not of the white kind, but yellow, And friends portended was preparing for A human PÃ¢tÃ© PÃ©rigord; She was, indeed, so very far from well, Her Son, in filial fear, procured a box Of those said pellets to resist Bile's shocksâ Andâtho' upon the ear it strangely knocksâ To save her by a Cockle from a shell! But Mrs. W., just like Macbeth, Who very vehemently bids us âthrow Bark to the Bow-wows,â hated physic so, It seem'd to share âthe bitterness of Death:â RhubarbâMagnesiaâJalap, and the kindâ SennaâSteelâAssa-fÅtida, and Squillsâ Powder or Draughtâbut least her throat inclined To give a course to Boluses or Pills; Noânot to save her life, in lung or lobe, For all her lights' or all her liver's sake, Would her convulsive thorax undertake, Only one little uncelestial globe! 'Tis not to wonder at, in such a case, If she put by the pill-box in a place For linen rather than for drugs intendedâ Yet for the credit of the pills let's say After they thus were stow'd away, Some of the linen mended; But Mrs. W., by disease's dint, Kept getting still more yellow in her tint, When lo! her second son, like elder brother, Marking the hue on the parental gills, Brought a new charge of Anti-turmeric Pills, To bleach the jaundiced visage of his Motherâ Who took themâin her cupboardâlike the other. âDeeper and deeper, still,â of course, The fatal colour daily grew in force; Till daughter W. newly come from Rome, Acting the self-same filial, pillial, part, To cure Mama, another dose brought home Of Cockles;ânot the Cockles of her heart! These going where the others went before, Of course she had a very pretty store; And thenâsome hue of health her cheek adorning, The Medicine so good must be, They brought her dose on dose, which she Gave to the up-stairs cupboard, ânight and morning.â Till wanting room at last, for other stocks, Out of the window one fine day she pitch'd The pillage of each box, and quite enrich'd The feed of Mister Burrell's hens and cocks,â A little Barber of a by-gone day, Over the way, Whose stock in trade, to keep the least of shops, Was one great head of Kemble,âthat is, John, Staring in plaster, with a Brutus on, And twenty little Bantam fowlsâwith crops. Little Dame W. thought when through the sash She gave the physic wings, To find the very things So good for bile, so bad for chicken rash, For thoughtless cock, and unreflecting pullet! But while they gathered up the nauseous nubbles, Each peck'd itself into a peck of troubles, And brought the hand of Death upon its gullet. They might as well have addled been, or ratted, For long before the nightâah! woe betide The Pills each suicidal Bantam died Unfatted! Think of poor Burrell's shock, Of Nature's debt to see his hens all payers, And laid in death as Everlasting Layers, With Bantam's small Ex-Emperor, the Cock, In ruffled plumage and funereal hackle, Giving, undone by Cockle, a last Cackle! To see as stiff as stone his un'live stock, It really was enough to move his block. Down on the floor he dash'd, with horror big, Mr. Bell's third wife's mother's coachman's wig; And with a tragic stare like his own Kemble, Burst out with natural emphasis enough, And voice that grief make tremble, Into that very speech of sad Macduffâ âWhat! all my pretty chickens and their dam, At one fell swoop!â Just when I'd bought a coop To see the poor lamented creatures cram!â After a little of this mood, And brooding over the departed brood, With razor he began to ope each craw, Already turning black, as black as coals; When lo! the undigested cause he sawâ âPison'd by goles!â To Mrs. W.'s luck a contradiction, Her window still stood open to conviction; And by short course of circumstantial labour, He fix'd the guilt upon his adverse neighbour;â Lord! how he rail'd at her: declaring now, He'd bring an action ere next Term of Hilary, Then, in another moment, swore a vow, He'd make her do pill-penance in the pillory! She, meanwhile distant from the dimmest dream Of combating with guilt, yard-arm or arm-yard, Lapp'd in a paradise of tea and cream; When up ran Betty with a dismal screamâ âHere's Mr. Burrell, ma'am, with all his farmyard!â Straight in he came, unbowing and unbending, With all the warmth that iron and a barber Can harbour; To dress the head and front of her offending, The fuming phial of his wrath uncorking; In short, he made her pay him altogether, In hard cash, very hard, for ev'ry feather, Charging, of course, each Bantam as a Dorking; Nothing could move him, nothing make him supple, So the sad dame unpocketing her loss, Had nothing left but to sit hands across, And see her poultry âgoing down ten couple.â Now birds by poison slain, As venom'd dart from Indian's hollow cane, Are edible; and Mrs. W.'s thrift,â She had a thrifty vein,â Destined one pair for supper to make shift,â Supper as usual at the hour of ten: But ten o'clock arrived and quickly pass'd, Elevenâtwelveâand one o'clock at last, Without a sign of supper even then! At length, the speed of cookery to quicken, Betty was called, and with reluctant feet, Came up at a white heatâ âWell, never I see chicken like them chicken! My saucepans they have been a pretty while in 'em! Enough to stew them, if it comes to that, To flesh and bones, and perfect rags; but drat Those Anti-biling Pills! there is no bile in 'em!â THE SWEEP'S COMPLAINT âI like to meet a sweepâsuch as come forth with the dawn, or somewhat earlier, with their little professional notes, sounding like the peep, peep, of a young sparrow.â âEssays of Elia. âA voice cried Sweep no more! Macbeth hath murdered sweep.â âShakspeare. One morning ere my usual time I rose, about the seventh chime, When little stunted boys that climb Still linger in the street; And as I walked, I saw indeed A sample of the sooty breed, Though he was rather run to seed, In height above five feet. A mongrel tint he seem'd to take, Poetic simile to make, Day through his Martin 'gan to break, White overcoming jet. From side to side he cross'd oblique, Like Frenchman who has friends to seek, And yet no English word can speak, He walk'd upon the fret: And while he sought the dingy job His lab'ring breast appear'd to throb, And half a hiccup half a sob Betray'd internal woe. To cry the cry he had by rote He yearn'd, but law forbade the note, Like Chanticleer with roupy throat, He gapedâbut not a crow! I watch'd him, and the glimpse I snatch'd Disclosed his sorry eyelids patch'd With red, as if the soot had catch'd That hung about the lid; And soon I saw the tear-drop stray, He did not care to brush away; Thought I, the cause he will betrayâ And thus at last he did. Well, here's a pretty go! here's a Gagging Act, if ever there was a gagging! But I'm bound the members as silenced us, in doing it had plenty of magging. They had better send us all off, they had, to the School for the Deaf and Dumb, To unlarn us our mother tongues, and to make signs and be regularly mum. But they can't undo naturâas sure as ever the morning begins to peep, Directly I open my eyes, I can't help calling out Sweep As natural as the sparrows among the chimbley-pots that say Cheep! For my own part I find my suppress'd voice very uneasy, And comparable to nothing but having your tissue stopt when you are sneezy. Well, it's all up with us! tho' I suppose we mustn't cry all up. Here's a precious merry Christmas, I'm blest if I can earn either bit or sup! If crying Sweep, of mornings, is going beyond quietness's border, Them as pretends to be fond of silence oughtn't to cry hear, hear, and order, order, I wonder Mr. Sutton, as we've sut-on too, don't sympathise with us As a Speaker what don't speak, and that's exactly our own cus. God help us if we don't not cry, how are we to pursue our callings? I'm sure we're not half so bad as other businesses with their bawlings. For instance, the general postmen, that at six o'clock go about ringing, And wake up all the babbies that their mothers have just got to sleep with singing. Greens oughtn't to be cried no more than blacksâto do the unpartial job, If they bring in a Sooty Bill, they ought to have brought in a Dusty Bob. Is a dustman's voice more sweet than ourn, when he comes a seeking arter the cinders, Instead of a little boy, like a blackbird in spring, singing merrily under your windows? There's the omnibus cads as plies in Cheapside, and keeps calling out Bank and City; Let his Worship, the Mayor, decide if our call of Sweep is not just as pretty. I can't see why the Jews should be let go about crying Old Close thro' their hooky noses, And Christian laws should be ten times more hard than the old stone laws of Moses. Why isn't the mouths of the muffin-men compell'd to be equally shut? Why, because Parliament members eat muffins, but they never eat no sut. Next year there won't be any May-day at all, we shan't have no heart to dance, And Jack in the Green will go in black like mourning for our mischance, If we live as long as May, that's to say, through the hard winter and pinching weather, For I don't see how we're to earn enough to keep body and soul together. I only wish Mr. Wilberforce, or some of them that pities the niggers, Would take a peep down in our cellars, and look at our miserable starving figures, A-sitting idle on our empty sacks, and all ready to eat each other, And a brood of little ones crying for bread to a heart-breaking Father and Mother. They haven't a rag of clothes to mend, if their mothers had thread and needles, But crawl naked about the cellars, poor things, like a swarm of common black beadles. If they'd only inquired before passing the Act, and taken a few such peeps, I don't think that any real gentleman would have set his face against sweeps. Climbing's an ancient respectable art, and if History's of any vally, Was recommended by Queen Elizabeth to the great Sir Walter Raleigh, When he wrote on a pane of glass how I'd climb, if the way I only knew, And she writ beneath, if your heart's afeard, don't venture up the flue. As for me, I was always loyal and respected all powers that are higher, But how can I now say God save the King, if I an't to be a Cryer? There's London milk, that's one of the cries, even on Sunday the law allows, But ought black sweeps, that are human beasts, to be worser off than black cows? Do we go calling about, when it's church time, like the noisy Billingsgate vermin, And disturb the parson with âAll alive O!â in the middle of a funeral sermon? But the fish won't keep, not the mackerel won't, is the cry of the Parliament elves, Every thing, except the sweeps I think, is to be allowed to keep themselves! Lord help us! what's to become of us if we mustn't cry no more? We shan't do for black mutes to go a standing at a death's door. And we shan't do to emigrate, no not even to the Hottentot nations, For as time wears on, our black will wear off, and then think of our situations! And we should not do, in lieu of black-a-moor footmen, to serve ladies of quality nimbly, For when we were drest in our sky-blue and silver, and large frills, all clean and neat, and white silk stockings, if they pleased to desire us to sweep the hearth, we couldn't resist the chimbley. THE SUB-MARINE It was a brave and jolly wight, His cheek was baked and brown, For he had been in many climes With captains of renown, And fought with those who fought so well At Nile and Camperdown. His coat it was a soldier coat, Of red with yellow faced, But (merman-like) he look'd marine All downward from the waist; His trowsers were so wide and blue, And quite in sailor taste! He put the rummer to his lips, And drank a jolly draught; He raised the rummer many timesâ And ever as he quaff'd, The more he drank, the more the ship Seem'd pitching fore and aft! The ship seem'd pitching fore and aft, As in a heavy squall; It gave a lurch and down he went, Head-foremost in his fall! Three times he did not rise, alas! He never rose at all! But down he went, right down at once, Like any stone he dived, He could not see, or hear, or feelâ Of senses all deprived! At last he gave a look around To see where he arrived! And all that he could see was green, Sea-green on every hand! And then he tried to sound beneath, And all he felt was sand! There he was fain to lie, for he Could neither sit nor stand! And lo! above his head there bent A strange and staring lass! One hand was in her yellow hair, The other held a glass; A mermaid she must surely be If ever mermaid was! Her fish-like mouth was open'd wide, Her eyes were blue and pale, Her dress was of the ocean green, When ruffled by a gale; Thought he âbeneath that petticoat She hides a salmon-tail!â She look'd as siren ought to look, A sharp and bitter shrew, To sing deceiving lullabies For mariners to rue,â But when he saw her lips apart, It chill'd him through and through! With either hand he stopp'd his ears Against her evil cry; Alas, alas, for all his care, His doom it seem'd to die, Her voice went ringing through his head, It was so sharp and high! He thrust his fingers farther in At each unwilling ear, But still, in very spite of all, The words were plain and clear; âI can't stand here the whole day long To hold your glass of beer!â With open'd mouth and open'd eyes, Up rose the Sub-marine, And gave a stare to find the sands And deeps where he had been: There was no siren with her glass! No waters ocean-green! The wet deception from his eyes Kept fading more and more, He only saw the bar-maid stand With pouting lip beforeâ The small green parlour of The Ship, And little sanded floor! DOG-GREL VERSES, BY A POOR BLIND âHark! hark! the dogs do bark, The beggars are coming ...â âOld Ballad. Oh what shall I do for a dog? Of sight I have not got a particle, Globe, Standard, or Sun, Times, Chronicleânone Can give me a good leading article. A Mastiff once led me about, But people appear'd so to fear himâ I might have got pence Without his defence, But Charity would not come near him. A Blood-hound was not much amiss, But instinct at last got the upper; And tracking Bill Soames, And thieves to their homes, I never could get home to supper. A Fox-hound once served me as guide, A good one at hill and at valley; But day after day He led me astray, To follow a milk-woman's tally. A Turnspit once did me good turns At going, and crossing, and stopping; Till one day his breed Went off at full speed, To spit at a great fire in Wapping. A Pointer once pointed my way, But did not turn out quite so pleasant; Each hour I'd a stop At a Poulterer's shop To point at a very high pheasant. A Pug did not suit me at all, The feature unluckily rose up; And folks took offence When offering pence, Because of his turning his nose up. A Butcher once gave me a dog, That turn'd out the worst one of any; A Bull dog's own pup, I got a toss up, Before he had brought me a penny. My next was a Westminster Dog, From Aistrop the regular cadger; But, sightless, I saw He never would draw A blind man so well as a badger. A greyhound I got by a swop, But, Lord! we soon came to divorces; He treated my strip Of cord like a slip, And left me to go my own courses. A poodle once tow'd me along, But always we came to one harbour; To keep his curls smart, And shave his hind part, He constantly call'd on a barber. My next was a Newfoundland brute, As big as a calf fit for slaughter; But my old cataract So truly he back'd I always fell into the water. I once had a sheep-dog for guide, His worth did not value a button; I found it no go, A Smithfield Ducrow, To stand on four saddles of mutton. My next was an Esquimaux dog, A dog that my bones ache to talk on, For picking his ways On cold frosty days He pick'd out the slides for a walk on. Bijou was a lady-like dog, But vex'd me at night not a little, When tea-time was come She would not go home, Her tail had once trail'd a tin kettle. I once had a sort of a Shock, And kiss'd a street post like a brother, And lost every tooth In learning this truthâ One blind cannot well lead another. A terrier was far from a trump, He had one defect, and a thorough, I never could stir, 'Od rabbit the cur! Without going into the Borough. My next was Dalmatian, the dog! And led me in danger, oh crikey! By chasing horse heels, Between carriage wheels, Till I come upon boards that were spiky. The next that I had was from Cross, And once was a favourite spaniel With Nero, now dead, And so I was led Right up to his den, like a Daniel. A mongrel I tried, and he did, As far as the profit and lossing, Except that the kind Endangers the blind, The breed is so fond of a crossing. A setter was quite to my taste, In alleys or streets broad or narrow, Till one day I met A very dead set, At a very dead horse in a barrow. I once had a dog that went mad, And sorry I was that I got him; It came to a run, And a man with a gun Pepper'd me when he ought to have shot him. My profits have gone to the dogs, My trade has been such a deceiver, I fear that my aim Is a mere losing game, Unless I can find a Retriever. THE KANGAROOS A FABLE A pair of married kangaroos (The case is oft a human one too) Were greatly puzzled once to choose A trade to put their eldest son to: A little brisk and busy chap, As all the little K.'s just then areâ About some two months off the lap,â They're not so long in arms as men are. A twist in each parental muzzle Betray'd the hardship of the puzzleâ So much the flavour of life's cup Is framed by early wrong or right, And Kangaroos we know are quite Dependent on their ârearing up.â The question, with its ins and outs, Was intricate and full of doubts; And yet they had no squeamish carings For trades unfit or fit for gentry, Such notion never had an entry, For they had no armorial bearings. Howbeit they're not the last on earth That might indulge in pride of birth; Who'er has seen their infant young Bob in and out their mother's pokes, Would own, with very ready tongue, They are not born like common folks. Well, thus the serious subject stood, It kept the old pair watchful nightly, Debating for young hopeful's good, That he might earn his livelihood, And go through life (like them) uprightly. Arms would not do at all; no, marry, In that line all his race miscarry; And agriculture was not proper, Unless they meant the lad to tarry For ever as a mere clod-hopper. He was not well cut out for preaching, At least in any striking style: And as for being mercantileâ He was not form'd for over-reaching. The lawâwhile there still fate ill-starr'd him: And plainly from the bar debarr'd him: A doctorâwho would ever see him? In music he could scarce engage, And as for going on the stage, In tragic socks I think I see him! He would not make a rigging-mounter; A haberdasher had some merit, But there the counter still ran counter, For just suppose A lady chose To ask him for a yard of ferret! A gardener digging up his beds, The puzzled parents shook their heads. âA tailor would not do becauseââ They paused and glanced upon his paws. Some parish post,âthough fate should place it Before him, how could he embrace it? In short, each anxious Kangaroo Discuss'd the matter through and through; By day they seem'd to get no nearer, 'Twas posing quiteâ And in the night Of course they saw their way no clearer! At last thus musing on their kneesâ Or hinder elbows if you pleaseâ It cameâno thought was ever brighter! In weighing every why and whether, They jump'd upon it both togetherâ âLet's make the imp a short-hand writer!â MORAL. I wish all human parents so Would argue what their sons are fit for; Some would-be critics that I know Would be in trades they have more wit for. ODE FOR THE NINTH OF NOVEMBER O Lud! O Lud! O Lud! I mean of course that venerable town, Mention'd in stories of renown, Built formerly of mud;â O Lud, I say, why didst thou e'er Invent the office of a Mayor, An office that no useful purpose crowns, But to set Aldermen against each other, That should be Brother unto Brother, Sisters at least, by virtue of their gowns? But still if one must have a Mayor To fill the Civic Chair, O Lud, I say, Was there no better day To fix on, than November, Ninth so shivery And dull for showing off the Livery's livery? Dimming, alas! The Brazier's brass, Soiling th'Embroiderers and all the Saddlers, Sopping the Furriers, Draggling the Curriers, And making Merchant Tailors dirty paddlers; Drenching the Skinners' Company to the skin, Making the crusty Vintner chiller, And turning the Distiller To cold without instead of warm within;â Spoiling the bran-new beavers Of Wax-chandlers and Weavers, Plastering the Plasterers and spotting Mercers, Hearty November-cursersâ And showing Cordwainers and dapper Drapers Sadly in want of brushes and of scrapers; Making the Grocers' Company not fit For company a bit; Dyeing the Dyers with a dingy flood, Daubing incorporated Bakers, And leading the Patten-makers Over their very pattens in the mud,â O Lud! O Lud! O Lud! âThis is a sorry sight,â To quote Macbethâbut oh, it grieves me quite, To see your wives and Daughters in their plumesâ White plumes not whiteâ Sitting at open windows catching rheums, Not âAngels ever bright and fair,â But angels ever brown and sallow, With eyesâyou cannot see above one pair, For city clouds of black and yellowâ And artificial flowers, rose, leaf, and bud, Such sable lilies And grim daffodillies, Drooping, but not for drought, O Lud! O Lud! I may as well, while I'm inclined, Just go through all the faults I find: O Lud! then, with a better air, say June, Could'st thou not find a better tune To sound with trumpets, and with drums, Than âSee the Conquering Hero comes,â When he who comes ne'er dealt in blood? Thy May'r is not a War Horse, Lud, That ever charged on Turk or Tartar, And yet upon a march you strike That treats him likeâ A little French if I may martyrâ Lewis Cart-Horse or Henry Carter! O Lud! I say Do change your day To some time when your Show can really show; When silk can seem like silk, and gold can glow. Look at your Sweepers, how they shine in May! Have it when there's a sun to gild the coach, And sparkle in tiaraâbraceletâbroochâ Diamondâor pasteâof sister, mother, daughter; When grandeur really may be grandâ But if thy pageant's thus obscured by landâ O Lud! it's ten times worse upon the water! Suppose, O Lud, to show its plan, I call, like Blue Beard's wife, to sister Anne, Who's gone to Beaufort Wharf with niece and aunt, To see what she can seeâand what she can't; Chewing a saffron bun by way of cud, To keep the fog out of a tender lung, While perch'd in a verandah nicely hung Over a margin of thy own black mud, O Lud! Now Sister Anne, I call to thee, Look out and see: Of course about the bridge you view them rally And sally, With many a wherry, sculler, punt, and cutter; The Fishmongers' grand boat, but not for butter, The Goldsmith's glorious galley; Of course you see the Lord Mayor's coach aquatic, With silken banners that the breezes fan, In gold all glowing, And men in scarlet rowing, Like Doge of Venice to the Adriatic; Of course you see all this, O Sister Anne? âNo, I see no such thing! I only see the edge of Beaufort Wharf, With two coal lighters fasten'd to a ring; And, dim as ghosts, Two little boys are jumping over posts; And something, farther off, That's rather like the shadow of a dog, And all beyond is fog. If there be anything so fine and bright, To see it I must see by second sight. Call this a Show? It is not worth a pin! I see no barges row, No banners blow; The Show is merely a gallanty-show, Without a lamp or any candle in.â But sister Anne, my dear, Although you cannot see, you still may hear? Of course you hear, I'm very sure of that, The âWater Parted from the Sea,â in C, Or âWhere the Bee sucks,â set in B; Or Huntsman's chorus from the Freyschutz frightful, Or Handel's Water Music in A flat. Oh music from the water comes delightful! It sounds as nowhere else it can: You hear it first In some rich burst, Then faintly sighing, Tenderly dying, Away upon the breezes, Sister Anne. âThere is no breeze to die on; And all their drums and trumpets, flutes and harps, Could never cut their way with ev'n three sharps Through such a fog as this, you may rely on. I think, but am not sure, I hear a hum, Like a very muffled double drum, And then a something faintly shrill, Like Bartlemy Fair's old buz at Pentonville. And now and then I hear a pop, As if from Pedley's Soda Water shop. I'm almost ill with the strong scent of mud, And, not to mention sneezing, My cough is, more than usual, teasing; I really fear that I have chill'd my blood, O Lud! O Lud! O Lud! O Lud! O Lud!â SONNET The sky is glowing in one ruddy sheet;â A cry of fire! resounds from door to door; And westward still the thronging people pour;â The turncock hastens to F. P. 6 feet, And quick unlocks the fountains of the street; While rumbling engines, with increasing roar, Thunder along to luckless Number Four, Where Mr. Dough makes bread for folks to eat. And now through blazing frames, and fiery beams, The Globe, the Sun, the PhÅnix, and what not, With gushing pipes throw up abundant streams, On burning bricks, and twists, on rollsâtoo hotâ And scorching loaves,âas if there were no shorter And cheaper way of making toast and-water! RONDEAU (EXTRACTED FROM A WELL-KNOWN ANNUAL) O curious reader, didst thou ne'er Behold a worshipful Lord May'r Seated in his great civic chair So dear? Then cast thy longing eyes this way, It is the ninth November day, And in his new-born state survey One here! To rise from little into great Is pleasant; but to sink in state From high to lowly is a fate Severe. Too soon his shine is overcast, Chill'd by the next November blast; His blushing honours only last One year! He casts his fur and sheds his chains, And moults till not a plume remainsâ The next impending May'r distrains His gear. He slips like water through a sieveâ Ah, could his little splendour live Another twelvemonthâhe would give One ear! SYMPTOMS OF OSSIFICATION âAn indifference to tears, and blood, and human suffering, that could only belong to a Boneyparte.â âLife of Napoleon. Time was, I always had a drop For any tale or sigh of sorrow; My handkerchief I used to sop Till often I was forced to borrow; I don't know how it is, but now My eyelids seldom want a drying; The doctors, p'rhaps, could tell me howâ I fear my heart is ossifying! O'er Goethe how I used to weep, With turnip cheeks and nose of scarlet, When Werter put himself to sleep With pistols kiss'd and clean'd by Charlotte; Self-murder is an awful sin, No joke there is in bullets flying, But now at such a tale I grinâ I fear my heart is ossifying! The Drama once could shake and thrill My nerves, and set my tears a stealing, The Siddons then could turn at will Each plug upon the main of feeling; At Belvidera now I smile, And laugh while Mrs. Haller's crying; 'Tis odd, so great a change of styleâ I fear my heart is ossifying! That heart was suchâsome years ago, To see a beggar quite would shock it, And in his hat I used to throw The quarter's savings of my pocket: I never wishâas I did then!â The means from my own purse supplying, To turn them all to gentlemenâ I fear my heart is ossifying! We've had some serious things of late, Our sympathies to beg or borrow, New melo-drames, of tragic fate, And acts, and songs, and tales of sorrow; Miss Zouch's case, our eyes to melt, And sundry actors sad good-bye-ing, But Lord!âso little have I felt, I'm sure my heart is ossifying! THE POACHER A SERIOUS BALLAD âBut a bold pheasantry, their country's pride, When once destroyed can never be supplied.â âGoldsmith. Bill Blossom was a nice young man, And drove the Bury coach; But bad companions were his bane, And egg'd him on to poach. They taught him how to net the birds, And how to noose the hare; And with a wiry terrier, He often set a snare. Each âshiny nightâ the moon was bright, To park, preserve, and wood He went, and kept the game alive, By killing all he could. Land-owners, who had rabbits, swore That he had this demeritâ Give him an inch of warren, he Would take a yard of ferret. At partridges he was not nice; And many, large and small, Without Hall's powder, without lead, Were sent to Leaden-Hall. He did not fear to take a deer From forest, park, or lawn; And without courting lord or duke, Used frequently to fawn. Folks who had hares discovered snaresâ His course they could not stop: No barber he, and yet he made Their hares a perfect crop. To pheasant he was such a foe, He tried the keepers' nerves; They swore he never seem'd to have Jam satis of preserves. The Shooter went to beat, and found No sporting worth a pin, Unless he tried the covers made Of silver, plate, or tin. In Kent the game was little worth, In Surrey not a button; The Speaker said he often tried The Manors about Sutton. No county from his tricks was safe; In each he tried his lucks, And when the keepers were in Beds, He often was at Bucks. And when he went to Bucks, alas! They always came to Herts; And even Oxon used to wish That he had his deserts. But going to his usual Hants, Old Cheshire laid his plots: He got entrapp'd by legal Berks, And lost his life in Notts. I CANNOT BEAR A GUN âTimidity is generally reckoned an essential attribute of the fair sex, and this absurd notion gives rise to more false starts, than a race for the Leger. Hence screams at mice, fits at spiders, faces at toads, jumps at lizards, flights from daddy longlegs, panics at wasps, sauve qui peut at sight of a gun. Surely, when the military exercise is made a branch of education at so many ladies' academies, the use of the musket would only be a judicious step further in the march of mind. I should not despair, in a month's practice, of making the most timid British female fond of small-arms.â âHints by a Corporal. It can't be minced, I'm quite convinced All girls are full of flam, Their feelings fine and feminine Are nothing else but sham. On all their tricks I need not fix, I'll only mention one, How many a Miss will tell you this, âI cannot bear a gun!â There's cousin Bell can't 'bide the smell Of powderâhorrid stuff! A single pop will make her drop, She shudders at a puff. My Manton near, with aspen fear Will make her scream and run: âIt's always so, you brute, you know I cannot bear a gun!â About my flask I must not ask, I must not wear a belt, I must not take a punch to make My pellets, card or felt; And if I just allude to dust, Or speak of number one, âI beg you'll notâdon't talk of shot, I cannot bear a gun!â Percussion cap I dare not snap, I may not mention Hall, Or raise my voice for Mr. Joyce, His wadding to recall; At Hawker's book I must not look, All shooting I must shun, Or elseââIt's hard, you've no regard, I cannot bear a gun!â The very dress I wear no less Must suit her timid mind, A blue or black must clothe my back, With swallow-tails behind; By fustian, jean, or velveteen Her nerves are overdone: âOh do not, John, put gaiters on, I cannot bear a gun!â Ev'n little James she snubs, and blames His Lilliputian train, Two inches each from mouth to breech, And charged with half a grainâ His crackers stopp'd, his squibbing dropp'd, He has no fiery fun, And all thro' her, âHow dare you, Sir? I cannot bear a gun!â Yet Major Flint,âthe Devil's in't! May talk from morn to night, Of springing mines, and twelves and nines And volleys left and right, Of voltigeurs and tirailleurs, And bullets by the ton: She never dies of fright, and cries âI cannot bear a gun!â It stirs my bile to see her smile At all his bang and whiz, But if I talk of morning walk, And shots as good as his, I must not name the fallen game: As soon as I've begun, She's in her pout, and crying out, âI cannot bear a gun!â Yet, underneath the rose, her teeth Are false, to match her tongue: Grouse, partridge, hares, she never spares, Or pheasants, old or youngâ On widgeon, teal, she makes a meal, And yet objects to none: âWhat have I got, it's full of shot! I cannot bear a gun!â At pigeon-pie she is not shy, Her taste it never shocks, Though they should be from Battersea, So famous for blue rocks; Yet when I bring the very thing My marksmanship has won, She cries, âLock up that horrid cup, I cannot bear a gun!â Like fool and dunce I got her once A box at Drury Lane, And by her side I felt a pride I ne'er shall feel again: To read the bill it made her ill, And this excuse she spun, âDer FreyschÃ¼tz, oh, seven shots! you know, I cannot bear a gun!â Yet at a hint from Major Flint, Her very hands she rubs, And quickly drest in all her best, Is off to Wormwood Scrubbs. The whole review she sits it through, With noise enough to stun, And never winks, or even thinks, âI cannot bear a gun!â She thus may blind the Major's mind In mock-heroic strife, But let a bout at war break out, And where's the soldier's wife, To take his kit and march a bit Beneath a broiling sun? Or will she cry, âMy dear, good-bye, I cannot bear a gun!â If thus she doats on army coats, And regimental cuffs, The yeomanry might surely be Secure from her rebuffs; But when I don my trappings on, To follow Captain Dunn, My carbine's gleam provokes a scream, âI cannot bear a gun!â It can't be minced, I'm quite convinced, All girls are full of flam, Their feelings fine, and feminine, Are nothing else but sham; On all their tricks I need not fix, I'll only mention one, How many a Miss will tell you this, âI cannot bear a gun!â TRIMMER'S EXERCISE FOR THE USE OF CHILDREN Here, come, Master Timothy Todd, Before we have done you'll look grimmer, You've been spelling some time for the rod, And your jacket shall know I'm a Trimmer. You don't know your A from your B, So backward you are in your Primer: Don't kneelâyou shall go on my knee, For I'll have you to know I'm a Trimmer. This morning you hinder'd the cook, By melting your dumps in the skimmer; Instead of attending your book,â But I'll have you to know I'm a Trimmer. To-day, too, you went to the pond, And bathed, though you are not a swimmer; And with parents so doting and fondâ But I'll have you to know I'm a Trimmer. After dinner you went to the wine, And help'd yourselfâyes, to a brimmer; You couldn't walk straight in a line, But I'll make you to know I'm a Trimmer. You kick little Tomkins about, Because he is slighter and slimmer; Are the weak to be thump'd by the stout? But I'll have you to know I'm a Trimmer. Then you have a sly pilfering trick, Your school-fellows call you the nimmer,â I will cut to the bone if you kick! For I'll have you to know I'm a Trimmer. To-day you made game at my back, You think that my eyes are grown dimmer, But I've watch'd you, I've got a sly knack! And I'll have you to know I'm a Trimmer. Don't think that my temper is hot, It's never beyond a slow simmer; I'll teach you to call me Dame Trot, But I'll have you to know I'm a Trimmer. Miss Edgeworth, or Mrs. Chapone, Might melt to behold your tears glimmer; Mrs. Barbauld would let you alone, But I'll have you to know I'm a Trimmer. THE FOX AND THE HEN A FABLE âSpeaking within compass, as to fabulousness I prefer Southcote to Northcote.â âPigrogromitus. One day, or night, no matter where or when, Sly Reynard, like a foot-pad, laid his pad Right on the body of a speckled Hen, Determined upon taking all she had; And like a very bibber at his bottle, Began to draw the claret from her throttle; Of course it put her in a pretty pucker, And with a scream as high As she could cry, She call'd for helpâshe had enough of sucker. Dame Partlet's scream Waked, luckily, the house-dog from his dream, And, with a savage growl In answer to the fowl, He bounded forth against the prowling sinner, And, uninvited, came to the Fox Dinner. Sly Reynard, heedful of the coming doom, Thought, self-deceived, He should not be perceived, Hiding his brush within a neighbouring broom; But quite unconscious of a Poacher's snare, And caught in copper noose, And looking like a goose, Found that his fate had âhung upon a hare;â His tricks and turns were render'd of no use to him, And, worst of all, he saw old surly Tray Coming to play Tray-Deuce with him. Tray, an old Mastiff bred at Dunstable, Under his Master, a most special constable, Instead of killing Reynard in a fury, Seized him for legal trial by a Jury; But JuriesâÃsop was a sheriff thenâ Consisted of twelve Brutes and not of Men. But first the Elephant sat on the bodyâ I mean the Henâand proved that she was dead, To the veriest fool's head Of the Booby and the Noddy. And then the Owl was call'dâfor, mark, The Owl can witness in the dark. To make the evidence more plain, The Lynx connected all the chain. In short there was no quirk or quibble At which a legal Rat could nibble; The Culprit was as far beyond hope's bounds, As if the Jury had been packedâof hounds. Reynard, however, at the utmost nick, Is seldom quite devoid of shift and trick; Accordingly our cunning Fox, Through certain influence, obscurely channel'd, A friendly Camel got into the box, When 'gainst his life the Jury was impanel'd. Now, in the Silly Isles such is the law, If Jurors should withdraw, They are to have no eating and no drinking, Till all are starved into one way of thinking. Thus Reynard's Jurors, who could not agree, Were lock'd up strictly, without bit or mummock, Till every Beast that only had one stomach, Bent to the Camel, who was blest with three. To do them justice, they debated From four till ten, while dinner waited, When thirst and hunger got the upper, And each inclined to mercy, and hot supper: âNot guiltyâ was the word, and Master Fox Was freed to murder other hens and cocks. MORAL. What moral greets us by this tale's assistance But that the Solon is a merry Solon. Who makes the full stop of a Man's existence Depend upon a Colon? THE COMET AN ASTRONOMICAL ANECDOTE âI cannot fill up a blank better than with a short history of this selfsame Starling.â âSterne's Sentimental Journey. Amongst professors of astronomy, Adepts in the celestial economy, The name of H??????l's very often cited; And justly so, for he is hand and glove With ev'ry bright intelligence above; Indeed, it was his custom so to stop, Watching the stars upon the house's top, That once upon a time he got beknighted. In his observatory thus coquetting With Venusâor with Juno gone astray, All sublunary matters quite forgetting In his flirtations with the winking stars, Acting the spyâit might be upon Marsâ A new AndrÃ©; Or, like a Tom of Coventry, sly peeping, At Dian sleeping; Or ogling through his glass Some heavenly lass Tripping with pails along the Milky Way; Or looking at that Wain of Charles the Martyr's:â Thus he was sitting, watchman of the sky, When lo! a something with a tail of flame Made him exclaim, âMy stars!ââhe always puts that stress on myâ âMy stars and garters!â âA comet, sure as I'm alive! A noble one as I should wish to view; It can't be Halley's though, that is not due Till eighteen thirty-five. Magnificent!âhow fine his fiery trail! Zounds! 'tis a pity, though, he comes unsoughtâ Unask'dâunreckon'd,âin no human thoughtâ He oughtâhe oughtâhe ought To have been caught With scientific salt upon his tail!â âI look'd no more for it, I do declare, Than the Great Bear! As sure as Tycho Brahe is dead, It really enter'd in my head, No more than Berenice's Hair! Thus musing, Heaven's Grand Inquisitor Sat gazing on the uninvited visitor Till John, the serving-man, came to the upper Regions, with âPlease your Honour, come to supper.â âSupper! good John, to-night I shall not sup Except on that phenomenonâlook up!â âNot sup!â cried John, thinking with consternation That supping on a star must be starvation, Or ev'n to batten On Ignes Fatui would never fatten, His visage seem'd to say,âthat very odd is,â But still his master the same tune ran on, âI can't come down,âgo to the parlour, John, And say I'm supping with the heavenly bodies.â âThe heavenly bodies!â echoed John, âAhem!â His mind still full of famishing alarms, â'Zooks, if your Honour sups with them, In helping, somebody must make long arms!â He thought his master's stomach was in danger, But still in the same tone replied the Knight, âGo down, John, go, I have no appetite, Say I'm engaged with a celestial stranger.ââ Quoth John, not much au fait in such affairs, âWouldn't the stranger take a bit downstairs?â âNo,â said the master, smiling, and no wonder, At such a blunder, âThe stranger is not quite the thing you think, He wants no meat or drink, And one may doubt quite reasonably whether He has a mouth, Seeing his head and tail are join'd together, Behold him,âthere he is, John, in the South.â John look'd up with his portentous eyes, Each rolling like a marble in its socket, At last the fiery tad-pole spies, And, full of Vauxhall reminiscence, cries, âA rare good rocket!â âA what! A rocket, John! Far from it! What you behold, John, is a comet; One of those most eccentric things That in all ages Have puzzled sages And frighten'd kings; With fear of change that flaming meteor, John, Perplexes sovereigns, throughout its rangeââ âDo he?â cried John, âWell, let him flare on, I haven't got no sovereigns to change!â LOVE AND LUNACY The Moonâwho does not love the silver moon, In all her fantasies and all her phases? Whether full-orb'd in the nocturnal noon, Shining in all the dewdrops on the daisies, To light the tripping Fairies in their mazes, Whilst stars are winking at the pranks of Puck; Or huge and red, as on brown sheaves she gazes; Or new and thin, when coin is turn'd for luck;â Who will not say that Dian is a Duck? But, oh! how tender, beautiful, and sweet, When in her silent round, serene, and clear, By assignation loving fancies meet, To recompense the pangs of absence drear! So Ellen, dreaming of Lorenzo, dear, But distant from the city mapp'd by Mogg, Still saw his image in that silver sphere, Plain as the Man with lantern, bush, and dog, That used to set our ancestors a-gog. And so she told him in a pretty letter, That came to hand exactly as Saint Meg's Was striking tenâeleven had been better; For then he might have eaten six more eggs, And both of the bedevill'd turkey-legs, With relishes from East, West, North, and South, Draining, beside, the teapot to the dregs; Whereas a man, whose heart is in his mouth, Is rather spoilt for hunger and for drouth. And so the kidneys, broiling hot, were wasted; The brawnâit never enter'd in his thought; The grated Parmesan remain'd untasted; The potted shrimps were left as they were bought, The capelings stood as merely good for nought, The German sausage did not tempt him better, Whilst Juno, licking her poor lips, was taught There's neither bone nor skin about a letter, Gristle, nor scalp, that one can give a setter. Heav'n bless the man who first devised a mail! Heav'n bless that public pile which stands concealing The Goldsmith's front with such a solid veil! Heav'n bless the Master, and Sir Francis Freeling, The drags, the nags, the leading or the wheeling, The whips, the guards, the horns, the coats of scarlet, The boxes, bags, those evening bells a-pealing! Heav'n bless, in short, each posting thing, and varlet, That helps a Werter to a sigh from Charlotte. So felt Lorenzo as he oped the sheet, Where, first, the darling signature he kiss'd, And then, recurring to its contents sweet With thirsty eyes, a phrase I must enlist, He gulp'd the words to hasten to their gist; In mortal ecstacy his soul was boundâ When, lo! with features all at once a-twist, He gave a whistle, wild enough in sound To summon Faustus's Infernal Hound! Alas! what little miffs and tiffs in love, A snubbish word, or pouting look mistaken, Will loosen screws with sweethearts hand and glove, Oh! love, rock firm when chimney-pots were shaken, A pettish breath will into huffs awaken, To spit like hump-back'd cats, and snarling Towzers! Till hearts are wreck'd and founder'd, and forsaken, As ships go to Old Davy, Lord knows how, sirs, While heav'n is blue enough for Dutchmen's trowsers! âThe moon's at full, love, and I think of youââ Who would have thought that such a kind P.S. Could make a man turn white, then red, then blue, Then black, and knit his eyebrows and compress His teeth, as if about to effervesce Like certain people when they lose at whist! So look'd the chafed Lorenzo, ne'ertheless, And, in a trice, the paper he had kiss'd Was crumpled like a snowball in his fist! Ah! had he been less versed in scientifics, More ignorant, in short, of what is what; He ne'er had flared up in such calorifics; But he would seek societies, and trot To ClubsâMechanics' Institutesâand got With BirkbeckâBartleyâCombeâGeorge RobinsâRennie, And other lecturing men. And had he not That work, of weekly parts, which sells so many, The Copper-bottomed Magazineâor âPennyâ? But, of all learned pools whereon, or in, Men dive like dabchicks, or like swallows skim, Some hardly damp'd, some wetted to the skin, Some drown'd like pigs when they attempt to swim, Astronomy was most Lorenzo's whim, ('Tis studied by a Prince amongst the Burmans); He loved those heavenly bodies which, the Hymn Of Addison declares, preach solemn sermons, While waltzing on their pivots like young Germans. Night after night, with telescope in hand, Supposing that the night was fair and clear, Aloft, on the house-top, he took his stand, Till he obtained to know each twinkling sphere Better, I doubt, than Milton's âStarry Vere;â Thus, reading thro' poor Ellen's fond epistle, He soon espied the flawâthe lapse so sheer That made him raise his hair in such a bristle, And like the Boatswain of the Storm-Ship whistle. âThe moon's at full, love, and I think of thee,ââ âIndeed! I'm very much her humble debtor, But not the moon-calf she would have me be, Zounds! does she fancy that I know no better?â Herewith, at either corner of the letter He gave a most ferocious, rending, pull;â âO woman! woman! that no vows can fetter, A moon to stay for three weeks at the full! By Jove; a very pretty cock-and-bull! âThe moon at full! 'twas very finely reckon'd! Why so she wrote me word upon the firstâ The twelfth, and now upon the twenty-secondâ Full!âyesâit must be full enough to burst! But let her goâof all vile jilts the worstââ Here with his thumbs he gave contemptuous snaps, Anon he blubber'd like the child that's nurs'd, And then he hit the table frightful raps, And stamp'd till he had broken both his straps. âThe moon's at fullâand I am in her thoughtâ No doubt: I do believe it in my soul!â Here he threw up his head, and gave a snort Like a young horse first harness'd to a pole: The moon is fullâaye, so is this d?d bowl!â And, grinning like the sourest of curmudgeons, Globeâwaterâfishesâhe dash'd down the whole, Strewing the carpet with the gasping gudgeons; Men do the strangest things in such love-dudgeons. âI fill her thoughtsâher memory's vice-gerent? No, no,âsome paltry puppyâthree weeks oldâ And round as Norval's shieldââthus incoherent His fancies grew as he went on to scold; So stormy waves are into breakers roll'd, Work'd up at last to mere chaotic wrothâ Thisâthatâheadsâtailsâthoughts jumbled uncontroll'd As onions, turnips, meat, in boiling broth, By turns bob up, and splutter in the froth. âFool that I was to let a baby faceâ A full oneâlike a hunter'sâround and redâ Ass that I am, to give her more a place Within this heartââand here he struck his head. â'Sdeath are the Almanack-compilers dead? But noâ'tis all an artificeâa trick, Some newer faceâsome dandy under-bredâ Wellâbe it soâof all the sex I'm sick!â Here Juno wonder'd why she got a kick. ââThe moon is fullââwhere's her infernal scrawl? âAnd you are in my thought: that silver ray Will ever your dear image thus recallââ My image? Mine! She'd barter it away For Pretty Poll's on an Italian's tray! Three weeks, full weeks,âit is too plainâtoo badâ Too gross and palpable! Oh cursed day! My senses have not crazedâbut if they hadâ Such moons would worry a Mad Doctor mad! âOh Nature! wherefore did you frame a lip So fair for falsehood? Wherefore have you drest Deceit so angel-like?â With sudden rip He tore six new buff buttons from his vest, And groped with hand impetuous at his breast, As if some flea from Juno's fleecy curls Had skipp'd to batten on a human chest, But noâthe hand comes forth, and down it hurls A lady's miniature beset with pearls. Yet long upon the floor it did not tarry, Before another outrage could be plann'd: Poor Juno, who had learn'd to fetch and carry, Pick'd up and brought it to her master's hand, Who seized it, and the mimic feature scann'd; Yet not with the old loving ardent drouth, He only saw in that fair face, so bland, Look how he would at it, east, west, north, south, A moon, a full one, with eyes, nose, and mouth. âI'll go to her,ââherewith his hat he touch'd, And gave his arm a most heroic brandish; âBut noâI'll writeââand here a spoon he clutch'd, And ramm'd it with such fury in the standish, A sable flood, like Niger the outlandish, Came rushing forthâOh Antics and Buffoons! Ye never danced a caper so ran-dan-dish; He jump'd, thump'dâtoreâswore, more than ten dragoons At all nights, noons, moons, spoons, and pantaloons! But soon ashamed, or weary, of such dancing, Without a Collinet's or Weippert's band, His rampant arms and legs left off their prancing, And down he sat again, with pen in hand, Not fiddle-headed, or King's-pattern grand, But one of Bramah's patent Caligraphics; And many a sheet it spoil'd before he plann'd A likely letter. Used to pure seraphics, Philippics sounded strangely after Sapphics. Long while he rock'd like Yankee in his chair, Staring as he would stare the wainscot through, And then he thrust his fingers in his hair, And set his crest up like a cockatoo; And trampled with his hoofs, a mere Yahoo: At last, with many a tragic frown and start, He penn'd a billet, very far from doux, 'Twas sour, severeâbut think of a man's smart Writing with lunar caustic on his heart! The letter done and closed, he lit his taper, And sealing, as it were, his other mocks, He stamp'd a grave device upon the paper, No Cupid toying with his Psyche's locks, But some stern head of the old Stoic stocksâ Then, fiercely striding through the staring streets, He dropt the bitter missive in a box, Beneath the cakes, and tarts, and sugar'd treats, In Mrs. Smelling's window-full of sweets. Soon sped the letterâthanks to modern plans, Our English mails run little in the style Of those great German wild-beast caravans, Eil-wagensâtho' they do not âgo like ile,ââ But take a good twelve minutes to the mileâ On Monday morning, just at ten o'clock, As Ellen humm'd âThe Young May Moonâ the while, Her ear was startled by that double knock Which thrills the nerves like an electric shock! Her right hand instantly forgot its cunning, And down into the street it dropt, or flung, Right on the hat and wig of Mr. Gunning, The jug that o'er her ten-week-stocks had hung; Then down the stairs by twos and threes she sprung, And through the passage like a burglar darted. Alas! how sanguine are the fond and youngâ She little thought, when with the coin she parted, She paid a sixpence to be broken-hearted! Too dear at any priceâhad she but paid Nothing and taken discount, it was dear; Yet, worthless as it was, the sweet-lipped maid Oft kissed the letter in her brief career Between the lower and the upper sphere, Where, seated in a study bistre-brown, She tried to pierce a mystery as clear As that I saw once puzzling a young clownâ âReading Made Easy,â but turned upside down. Yet Ellen, like most misses in the land, Had sipped sky blue, through certain of her teens, At one of those establishments which stand In highways, byeways, squares, and village greens; 'Twas called âThe Grove,ââa name that always means Two poplars stand like sentries at the gateâ Each window had its close Venetian screens And Holland blind, to keep in a cool state The twenty-four Young Ladies of Miss Bate. But when the screens were left unclosed by chance, The blinds not down, as if Miss B. were dead, Each upper window to a passing glance Revealed a little dimity white bed; Each lower one a cropp'd or curly head; And thrice a week, for soul's and health's economies, Along the road the twenty-four were led, Like coupled hounds, whipped in by two she-dominies With faces rather graver than Melpomene's. And thus their studies they pursued:âOn Sunday, Beef, collects, batter, texts from Dr. Price; Mutton, French, pancakes, grammarâof a Monday; Tuesdayâhard dumplings, globes, Chapone's Advice; Wednesdayâfancy-work, rice-milk (no spice); Thursdayâpork, dancing, currant-bolsters, reading; Fridayâbeef, Mr. Butler, and plain rice; Saturdayâscraps, short lessons and short feeding, Stocks, back-boards, hash, steel-collars, and good breeding. From this repertory of female learning, Came Ellen once a quarter, always fatter! To gratify the eyes of parents yearning. 'Twas evident in bolsters, beef, and batter, Hard dumplings, and rice-milk, she did not smatter, But heartily, as Jenkins says, âdemollidge;â But as for any learning, not to flatter, As often happens when girls leave their college, She had done nothing but grow out of knowledge. At Long Division sums she had no chance, And History was quite as bad a balk; Her French it was too small for Petty France, And Priscian suffered in her English talk: Her drawing might be done with cheese or chalk; As for the globesâthe use of the terrestrial She knew when she went out to take a walk, Or take a ride; but, touching the celestial, Her knowledge hardly soared above the bestial. Nothing she learned of Juno, Pallas, Mars; Georgium, for what she knew, might stand for Burgo, Sidus, for Master: then, for northern stars, The Bear she fancied did in sable fur go, The Bull was Farmer Giles's bull, and, ergo, The Ram the same that butted at her brother; As for the twins, she only guessed that Virgo, From coming after them, must be their mother; The Scales weighed soap, tea, figs, like any other. As ignorant as donkeys in Gallicia, She thought that Saturn, with his Belt, was but A private, may be, in the Kent Militia; That Charles's Wain would stick in a deep rut, That Venus was a real West-End slutâ Oh, Gods and Goddesses of Greek Theogony! That Berenice's Hair would curl and cut, That Cassiopeia's Chair was good Mahogany, Nicely french-polished,âsuch was her cosmogony! Judge, then, how puzzled by the scientifics Lorenzo's letter came now to dispense; A lizard, crawling over hieroglyphics, Knows quite as much of their Egyptian sense; A sort of London fog, opaque and dense, Hung over verbs, nouns, genitives, and datives; In vain she pored and pored, with eyes intense, As well is known to oyster-operatives, Mere looking at the shells won't open natives. Yet mixed with the hard words, so called, she found Some easy ones that gave her heart the staggers; Words giving tongue against her, like a hound At picking out a faultâwords speaking daggers. The very letters seemed, in hostile swaggers, To lash their tails, but not as horses do, Nor like the tails of spaniels, gentle waggers, But like the lion's, ere he tears in two A black, to see if he is black all through. With open mouth, and eyeballs at full stretch, She gazed upon the paper sad and sorry, No soundâno stirâquite petrified, poor wretch! As when Apollo, in old allegory, Down-stooping like a falcon, made his quarry Of Niobe, just turned to Purbeck stone; In fact, since Cupid grew into a worry, Judge if a suing lover, let alone A lawyer, ever wrote in such a tone. âEllen, I will no longer call you mine, That time is past, and ne'er can come again; However other lights undimmed may shine, And undiminishing, one truth is plain, Which I, alas! have learned,âthat love can wane. The dream is pass'd away, the veil is rent, Your heart was not intended for my reign; A sphere so full, I feel, was never meant With one poor man in it to be content. âIt must, no doubt, be pleasant beyond measure, To wander underneath the whispering bough With Dian, a perpetual round of pleasure. Nay, fear not,âI absolve of every vow,â Use,âuse your own celestial pleasure now, Your apogee and perigee arrange. Herschel might aptly stare and wonder how, To me that constant disk has nothing strangeâ A counterfeit is sometimes hard to change. âOh Ellen! I once little thought to write Such words unto you, with so hard a pen; Yet outraged love will change its nature quite, And turn like tiger hunted to its denâ How Falsehood trips in her deceits on men! And stands abash'd, discover'd, and forlorn! Had it been only cusp'dâbut gibbousâthen It had gone downâbut Faith drew back in scorn, And would not swallow itâwithout a horn! âI am in occultation,âthat is plain: My culmination's past,âthat's quite as clear. But think not I will suffer your disdain To hang a lunar rainbow on a tear. Whate'er my pangs, they shall be buried here; No murmur,ânot a sigh,âshall thence exhale: Smile on,âand for your own peculiar sphere Choose some eccentric path,âyou cannot fail, And pray stick on a most portentous tail! âFarewell! I hope you are in health and gay; For me, I never felt so well and merryâ As for the bran-new idol of the day, Monkey or man, I am indifferentâvery! Nor e'en will ask who is the Happy Jerry; My jealousy is dead, or gone to sleep, But let me hint that you will want a wherry, Three weeks' spring-tide, and not a chance of neap, Your parlours will be flooded six feet deep! âOh Ellen! how delicious was that light Wherein our plighted shadows used to blend, Meanwhile the melancholy bird of nightâ No more of thatâthe lover's at an end. Yet if I may advise you, as a friend, Before you next pen sentiments so fond, Study your cyclesâI would recommend Our Airyâand let South be duly conn'd, And take a dip, I beg, in the great Pond. âFarewell again! it is farewell for ever! Before your lamp of night be lit up thrice, I shall be sailing, haply, for Swan River, Jamaica, or the Indian land of rice, Or Boothia Felixâhappy clime of ice! For Trebizond, or distant Scanderoon, Ceylon, or Java redolent of spice, Or settling, neighbour of the Cape baboon, Or roaming o'erâThe Mountains of the Moon! âWhat matters where? my world no longer owns That dear meridian spot from which I dated Degrees of distance, hemispheres, and zones, A globe all blank and barren and belated. What matters where my future life be fated? With Lapland hordes, or Koords or Afric peasant, A squatter in the western woods located, What matters where? My bias, at the present, Leans to the country that reveres the Crescent! âFarewell! and if for ever, fare thee well! As wrote another of my fellow-martyrs: I ask no sexton for his passing-bell, I do not ask your tear-drops to be starters, However I may die, transfix'd by Tartars, By Cobras poisoned, by Constrictors strangled, By shark or cayman snapt above the garters, By royal tiger or Cape lion mangled, Or starved to death in the wild woods entangled, âOr tortured slowly at an Indian stake, Or smother'd in the sandy hot simoom, Or crush'd in Chili by earth's awful quake, Or baked in lava, a Vesuvian tomb, Or dirged by syrens and the billows' boom, Or stiffen'd to a stock mid Alpine snows, Or stricken by the plague with sudden doom, Or suck'd by Vampyres to a last repose, Or self-destroy'd, impatient of my woes: âStill fare you well, however I may fare, A fare perchance to the Lethean shore, Caught up by rushing whirlwinds in the air, Or dash'd down cataracts with dreadful roar: Nay, this warm heart, once yours unto the core, This hand you should have claim'd in church or minster, Some cannibal may gnawââshe read no moreâ Prone on the carpet fell the senseless spinster, Losing herself, as 'twere, in Kidderminster! Of course of such a fall the shock was great, In rush'd the father, panting from the shop, In rush'd the mother, without cap or tÃªte, Pursued by Betty Housemaid with her mop; The cook to change her apron did not stop, The charwoman next scrambled up the stair,â All help to lift, to haul, to seat, to prop, And then they stand and smother round the chair, Exclaiming in a chorus, âGive her air!â One sears her nostrils with a burning feather, Another rams a phial up her nose; A third crooks all her finger-joints together, A fourth rips up her laces and her bows, While all by turns keep trampling on her toes, And, when she gasps for breath, they pour in plump A sudden drench that down her thorax goes, As if in fetching herâsome wits so jumpâ She must be fetch'd with water like a pump! No wonder that thus drench'd, and wrench'd, and gall'd, As soon as possible, from syncope's fetter Her senses had the sense to be recall'd, âI'm betterâthat will doâindeed I'm better,â She cried to each importunate besetter; Meanwhile, escaping from the stir and smother, The prudent parent seized the lover's letter, (Daughters should have no secrets with a Mother) And read it thro' from one end to the other. From first to last, she never skipp'd a wordâ For young Lorenzo of all youths was one So wise, so good, so moral she averr'd, So clever, quite above the common runâ She made him sit by her, and call'd him son, No matrimonial suit, e'en Duke's or Earl's, So flatter'd her maternal feelingsânone! For mothers always think young men are pearls Who come and throw themselves before their girls. And now, at warning signal from her finger, The servants most reluctantly withdrew, But list'ning on the stairs contrived to linger; For Ellen, gazing round with eyes of blue, At last the features of her parent knew, And, summoning her breath and vocal pow'rs, âOh, mother!â she exclaimedââOh, is it trueâ Our dear Lorenzoââthe dear name drew show'rsâ âOurs,â cried the mother, âpray don't call him ours! âI never liked him, never, in my days!â (âOh yesâyou didââsaid Ellen with a sob,) âThere always was a something in his waysââ (âSo sweetâso kind,â said Ellen, with a throb,) âHis very face was what I call a snob, And, spite of West-end coats and pantaloons, He had a sort of air of the swell mob; I'm sure when he has come of afternoons To tea, I've often thoughtâI'll watch my spoons!â âThe spoons!â cried Ellen, almost with a scream, âOh cruelâfalse as cruelâand unjust! He that once stood so high in your esteem!â âHe!â cried the dame, grimacing her disgust, âI like him?âyesâas any body must An infidel that scoffs at God and Devil: Didn't he bring you Bonaparty's bust? Lord! when he calls I hardly can be civilâ My favourite was always Mr. Neville. âLorenzo?âI should like, of earthly things, To see him hanging forty cubits high; Doesn't he write like Captain Rocks and Swings? Nay, in this very letter bid you try To make yourself particular, and tie A tail onâa prodigious tail!âOh, daughter! And don't he ask you down his areaâfie! And recommend to cut your being shorter, With brick-bats round your neck in ponds of water?â Alas! to think how readers thus may vary A writer's sense!âWhat mortal would have thought Lorenzo's hint about Professors Airy And Pond to such a likeness could be brought! Who would have dreamt the simple way he taught To make a comet of poor Ellen's moon, Could furnish forth an image so distraught, As Ellen, walking Regent Street at noon, Tail'dâlike a fat Cape sheep, or a racoon! And yet, whate'er absurdity the brains May hatch, it ne'er wants wet-nurses to suckle it; Or dry ones, like a hen, to take the pains To lead the nudity abroad, and chuckle it; No whim so stupid but some fool will buckle it To jingle bell-like on his empty head, No mental mudâbut some will knead and knuckle it, And fancy they are making fancy-bread;â No ass has written, but some ass has read. No dolts could lead if others did not follow 'em. No HahnÃ©mann could give decillionth drops, If any man could not be got to swallow 'em; But folly never comes to such full stops. As soon, then, as the Mother made such swaps Of all Lorenzo's meanings, heads and tails, The Father seized upon her malapropsâ âMy girl down areasâof a night! 'Ods nails! I'll stick the scoundrel on his area-rails! âI will!âas sure as I was christen'd John! A girlâwell bornâand bred,âand school'd at Dittonâ Accomplish'dâhandsomeâwith a tail stuck on! And chuck'dâZounds!âchuck'd in horseponds like a kitten; I wish I had been by when that was written!ââ And doubling to a fist each ample hand, The empty air he boxed with, a-la-Bitton, As if in training for a fight, long plann'd, With Nobodyâfor loveâat No Man's Land! âI'll pondâI'll tail him!ââIn a voice of thunder He recommenced his fury and his fuss, Loud, open-mouth'd, and wedded to his blunder, Like one of those great guns that end in buss. âI'll teach him to write ponds and tails to us!â But while so menacing this-that-and-t'others, His wife broke in with certain truths, as thus: âMen are not womenâfathers can't be mothers,â Females are femalesââand a few such others. So saying, with rough nudges, willy-nilly, She hustled him outside the chamber-door, Looking, it must be own'd, a little silly; And then she did as the Carinthian boor Serves (Goldsmith says) the traveller that's poor: Id est, she shut him in the outer space, With just as much apologyâno moreâ As Boreas would present in such a case, For slamming the street door right in your face. And now, the secrets of the sex thus kept, What passed in that important tÃªte-Ã -tete 'Twixt dam and daughter, nobody except Paul Pry, or his Twin Brother, could narrateâ So turn we to Lorenzo, left of late, In front of Mrs. Snelling's sugar'd snacks, In such a very waspish stinging stateâ But now at the Old Dragon, stretch'd on racks, Fretting, and biting down his nails to tacks; Because that new fast four-insideâthe Comet, Instead of keeping its appointed time, Had deviated some few minutes from it, A thing with all astronomers a crime, And he had studied in that lore sublime; Nor did his heat get any less or shorter For pouring upon passion's unslaked lime A well-grown glass of Cogniac and water, Mix'd stiff as starch by the Old Dragon's daughter. At length, âFair Ellenâ sounding with a flourish, The Comet came all bright, bran new, and smart; Meanwhile the melody conspired to nourish The hasty spirit in Lorenzo's heart, And soon upon the roof he âtopped his part.â Which never had a more impatient man on, Wishing devoutly that the steeds would start Like lightning greased,âor, as at Ballyshannon Sublimed, âgreased lightning shot out of a cannon.â For, ever since the letter left his hand, His mind had been in vacillating motion, Dodge-dodging like a fluster'd crab on land, That cannot ask its way, and has no notion If right or left leads to the German Oceanâ Hatred and Love by turns enjoy'd monopolies, Till, like a Doctor following his own potion, Before a learned pig could spell Acropolis, He went and booked himself for our metropolis. âOh, for a horse,â or rather four,ââwith wings!â For so he put the wish into the pluralâ No relish he retained for country things, He could not join felicity with rural, His thoughts were all with London and the mural, Where architectsânot paupersâheap and pile stones; Or with the horses' muscles, called the crural, How fast they could macadamize the milestones Which pass'd as tediously as gall or bile stones. Blind to the picturesque, he ne'er perceived In Nature one artistical fine stroke; For instance, how that purple hill relieved The beggar-woman in the gipsy-poke, And how the red cow carried off her cloak; Or how the aged horse, so gaunt and grey, Threw off a noble mass of beech and oak! Or, how the tinker's ass, beside the way, Came boldly out from a white cloudâto bray! Such things have no delight for worried men, That travel full of care and anxious smart: Coachmen and horses, are your artists then; Just try a team of draughtsmen with the Dart, Take Shee, for instance, Etty, Jones, and Hart, Let every neck be put into its noose, Then tip 'em on the flank to make 'em start, And see how they will draw!âFour screws let loose Would make a differenceâor I'm a goose! Nor cared he more about the promised crops, If oats were looking up, or wheat was laid, For flies in turnips, or a blight in hops, Or how the barley prosper'd or decay'd; In short, no items of the farming trade, Peas, beans, tares, 'taters, could his mind beguile; Nor did he answer to the servant maid, That always asked at every other mile, âWhere do we change, Sir?â with her sweetest smile. Nor more he listened to the Politician, Who lectured on his left, a formal prig, Of Belgium's, Greece's, Turkey's sad condition, Not worth a cheese, an olive, or a fig; Nor yet unto the critic, fierce and big, Who, holding forth, all lonely, in his glory, Called one a sad bad Poetâand a Whig, And one, a first-rate proserâand a Tory; So critics judge, now, of a song or story. Nay, when the coachman spoke about the 'Leger, Of Popsy, Mopsy, Bergamotte, and Civet, Of breeder, trainer, owner, backer, hedger, And nags as right, or righter than a trivet, The theme his crack'd attention could not rivet; Though leaning forward to the man of whips, He seem'd to give an ear,âbut did not give it, For Ellen's moon (that saddest of her slips) Would not be hidden by a ânew Eclipse.â If any thought e'er flitted in his head Belonging to the sphere of Bland and Crocky, It was to wish the team all thorough-bred, And every buckle on their backs a jockey: When spinning down a steep descent, or rocky, He never watch'd the wheel, and long'd to lock it; He liked the bolters that set off so cocky: Nor did it shake a single nerve or shock it, Because the Comet raced against the Rocket. Thanks to which rivalry, at last the journey Finish'd an hour and a quarter under time, Without a case for surgeon or attorney, Just as St. James's rang its seventh chime, And now, descending from his seat sublime, Behold Lorenzo, weariest of wights, In that great core of brick, and stone, and lime, Call'd England's Heartâbut which, as seen of nights, Has rather more th'apperance of its lights. Away he scuddedâelbowing, perforce, Thro' cads, and lads, and many a Hebrew worrier, With fruit, knives, pencils,âall dirt cheap of course, Coachmen, and hawkers, of the Globe and âCurrier;â Away!âthe cookmaid is not such a skurrier, When, fit to split her gingham as she goes, With six just striking on the clock to hurry her, She strides along with one of her three beaux, To get well placed at âAshley'sâânow Ducrow's. âI wonder if her moon is full to-night!â He mutter'd, jealous as a Spanish Don, When, lo!âto aggravate that inward spite, In glancing at a board he spied thereon A play-bill for dramatic folks to con, In letters such as those may read, who run, ââKING JOHNââoh yes,âI recollect King John! âMy Lord, they say five moonsââfive moons!âwell done! I wonder Ellen was content with one! âFive moonsâall full!âand all at once in heav'n! She should have lived in that prolific reign!â Here he arrived in front of number seven, Th'abode of all his joy and all his pain; A sudden tremor shot through every vein, He wish'd he'd come up by the heavy waggon, And felt an impulse to turn back again, Oh, that he ne'er had quitted the Old Dragon! Then came a sort of longing for a flagon. His tongue and palate seem'd so parch'd with drouth,â The very knocker fill'd his soul with dread, As if it had a living lion's mouth, With teeth so terrible, and tongue so red, In which he had engaged to put his head. The bell-pull turn'd his courage into vapour, As though 'twould cause a shower-bath to shed Its thousand shocks, to make him sigh and caperâ He look'd askance, and did not like the scraper. âWhat business have I here? (he thought) a dunce A hopeless passion thus to fan and foster, Instead of putting out its wick at once; She's goneâit's very evident I've lost her,â And to the wanton wind I should have toss'd herâ Pish! I will leave her with her moon, at ease, To toast and eat it, like a single Gloster, Or cram some fool with it, as good green cheese, Or make a honey-moon, if so she please. âYesâhere I leave her,â and as thus he spoke, He plied the knocker with such needless force, It almost split the panel of sound oak; And then he went as wildly through a course Of ringing, till he made abrupt divorce Between the bell and its dumbfounded handle; Whilst up ran Betty, out of breath and hoarse, And thrust into his face her blown-out candle, To recognise the author of such scandal. Who, presto! cloak, and carpet-bag to boot, Went stumbling, rumbling, up the dark one pair, With other noise than his whose âvery foot Had music in't as he came up the stair:â And then with no more manners than a bear, His hat upon his head, no matter how, No modest tap his presence to declare, He bolted in a room, without a bow, And there sat Ellen, with a marble brow! Like fond Medora, watching at her window, Yet not of any Corsair bark in searchâ The jutting lodging-house of Mrs. Lindo, âThe Cheapest House in Townâ of Todd and Sturch, The private house of Reverend Doctor Birch, The public-house, closed nightly at eleven, And then that house of prayer, the parish church, Some roofs, and chimneys, and a glimpse of heaven, Made up the whole look-out of Number Seven. Yet something in the prospect so absorbed her, She seemed quite drowned and dozing in a dream; As if her own belov'd full moon still orb'd her, Lulling her fancy in some lunar scheme, With lost Lorenzo, may be, for its themeâ Yet when Lorenzo touch'd her on the shoulder, She started up with an abortive scream, As if some midnight ghost, from regions colder, Had come within his bony arms to fold her. âLorenzo!âââEllen!ââthen came âSir!â and âMadam!â They tried to speak, but hammer'd at each word, As if it were a flint for great Mac Adam; Such broken English never else was heard, For like an aspen leaf each nerve was stirr'd, A chilly tremor thrill'd them through and through, Their efforts to be stiff were quite absurd, They shook like jellies made without a due And proper share of common joiner's glue. âEllen! I'm comeâto bid youâfareâfarewellâ They thus began to fight their verbal duel; âSince some more hapâhapâhappy man must dwellââ âAlasâLorenâLorenzo!âcruâcruâcruel!â For so they split their words like grits for gruel. At last the Lover, as he long had plann'd, Drew out that once inestimable jewel, Her portrait, which was erst so fondly scann'd, And thrust poor Ellen's face into her hand. âThereâtake it, Madamâtake it back I crave, The face of oneâbut I must now forget her, Bestow it on whatever hapless slave Your art has last enticed into your fetterâ And there are your epistlesâthere! each letter! I wish no record of your vow's infractions, Send them to Southâor Childrenâyou had betterâ They will be noveltiesârare benefactions To shine in Philosophical Transactions! âTake themâpray take themâI resign them quite! And there's the glove you gave me leave to stealâ And there's the handkerchief, so pure and white Once sanctified by tears, when Miss O'Neillâ But noâyou did notâcannotâdo not feel A Juliet's faith, that time could only harden! Fool that I was, in my mistaken zeal! I should have led you,âby your leave and pardonâ To Bartley's Orrery, not Covent Garden! âAnd here's the birth-day ringânor man nor devil Should once have torn it from my living hand, Perchance 'twill look as well on Mr. Neville; And thatâand that is allâand now I stand Absolved of each dissever'd tie and bandâ And so farewell, till Time's eternal sickle Shall reap our lives; in this, or foreign land Some other may be found for truth to stickle Almost as fairâand not so false and fickle!â And there he ceased: as truly it was time, For of the various themes that left his mouth, One half surpass'd her intellectual climb: She knew no more than the old Hill of Howth About that âChildren of a larger growth,â Who notes proceedings of the F. R. S.'s; Kit North, was just as strange to her as South, Except the south the weathercock expresses, Nay, Bartley's Orrery defied her guesses. Howbeit some notion of his jealous drift She gather'd from the simple outward fact, That her own lap contained each slighted gift; Though quite unconscious of his cause to act So like Othello, with his face unblack'd; âAlas!â she sobbed, âyour cruel course I see, These faded charms no longer can attract; Your fancy palls, and you would wander free, And lay your own apostacy on me! âI, false!âunjust Lorenzo!âand to you! Oh, all ye holy gospels that incline The soul to truth, bear witness I am true! By all that lives, of earthly or divineâ So long as this poor throbbing heart is mineâ I false!âthe world shall change its course as soon! True as the streamlet to the stars that shineâ True as the dial to the sun at noon, True as the tide to âyonder blessed moonâ!â And as she spoke, she pointed through the window, Somewhere above the houses' distant tops, Betwixt the chimney-pots of Mrs. Lindo, And Todd and Sturch's cheapest of all shops For ribbons, laces, muslins, silks, and fops;â Meanwhile, as she upraised her face so Grecian, And eyes suffused with scintillating drops, Lorenzo looked, too, o'er the blinds venetian, To see the sphere so troubled with repletion. âThe Moon!â he cried, and an electric spasm Seem'd all at once his features to distort, And fix'd his mouth, a dumb and gaping chasmâ His faculties benumb'd and all amortâ At last his voice came, of most shrilly sort, Just like a sea-gull's wheeling round a rockâ âSpeak!âEllen!âis your sight indeed so short! The Moon!âBrute! savage that I am, and block! The Moon! (O, ye Romantics, what a shock!) Why, that's the new Illuminated Clock!â THOSE EVENING BELLS âI'D BE A PARODYâ Those Evening Bells, those Evening Bells, How many a tale their music tells, Of Yorkshire cakes and crumpets prime, And letters only just in time!â The Muffin-boy has pass'd away, The Postman goneâand I must pay, For down below Deaf Mary dwells, And does not hear those Evening Bells. And so 'twill be when she is gone, That tuneful peal will still ring on, And other maids with timely yells Forget to stay those Evening Bells. LINES TO A FRIEND AT COBHAM 'Tis pleasant, when we've absent friends, Sometimes to hob and nob 'em With Memory's glassâat such a pass, Remember me at Cobham! Have pigs you will, and sometimes kill, But if you sigh and sob 'em, And cannot eat your home-grown meat, Remember me at Cobham! Of hen and cock, you'll have a stock, And death will oft unthrob 'em,â A country chick is good to pickâ Remember me at Cobham! Some orchard trees of course you'll lease, And boys will sometimes rob 'em, A friend (you know) before a foeâ Remember me at Cobham! You'll sometimes have wax-lighted rooms, And friends of course to mob 'em; Should you be short of such a sort, Remember me at Cobham!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE QUAKERS' CONVERSAZIONE I SONNET How sweet thus clad, in Autumn's mellow Tone BY R. M. How sweet thus clad, in Autumn's mellow Tone, With serious Eye, the russet Scene to view! No Verdure decks the Forest, save alone The sad green Holly, and the olive Yew. The Skies, no longer of a garish Blue, Subdued to Dove-like Tints, and soft as Wool, Reflected show their slaty Shades anew In the drab Waters of the clayey Pool. Meanwhile yon Cottage Maiden wends to School, In Garb of Chocolate so neatly drest, And Bonnet puce, fit object for the Tool, And chasten'd Pigments, of our Brother West; Yea, all is silent, sober, calm, and cool, Save gaudy Robin with his crimson Breast. II LINES ON THE CELEBRATION OF PEACE BY DORCAS DOVE And is it thus ye welcome Peace! From Mouths of forty-pounding Bores? Oh cease, exploding Cannons, cease! Lest Peace, affrighted, shun our shores! Not so the quiet Queen should come; But like a Nurse to still our Fears, With Shoes of List, demurely dumb, And Wool or Cotton in her Ears! She asks for no triumphal Arch; No steeples for their ropy Tongues; Down, Drumsticks, down, She needs no March, Or blasted Trumps from brazen Lungs. She wants no Noise of Mobbing Throats To tell that She is drawing nigh: Why this Parade of scarlet Coats, When War has closed his bloodshot Eye? Returning to Domestic Loves, When war has ceased with all its Ills, Captains should come like sucking Doves, With Olive Branches in their Bills. No need there is of vulgar Shout, Bells, Cannons, Trumpets, Fife, and Drum, And Soldiers marching all about, To let Us know that Peace is come. Oh mild should be the Signs and meek, Sweet Peace's Advent to proclaim! Silence her noiseless Foot should speak, And Echo should repeat the same. Lo! where the Soldier walks, alas! With Scars received on foreign Grounds; Shall we consume in coloured Glass The Oil that should be pour'd in Wounds? The bleeding Gaps of War to close, Will whizzing Rocket-Flight avail? Will Squibs enliven Orphans' Woes? Or Crackers cheer the Widow's Tale?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE LAMENT OF TOBY, THE LEARNED PIG âA little learning is a dangerous thing.â âPope. O heavy day! oh day of woe! To misery a poster, Why was I ever farrow'dâwhy Not spitted for a roaster? In this world, pigs, as well as men, Must dance to fortune's fiddlings, But must I give the classics up, For barley-meal and middlings? Of what avail that I could spell And read, just like my betters, If I must come to this at last, To litters, not to letters? O, why are pigs made scholars of? It baffles my discerning, What griskins, fry, and chitterlings Can have to do with learning. Alas! my learning once drew cash, But public fame's unstable, So I must turn a pig again, And fatten for the table. To leave my literary line My eyes get red and leaky; But Giblett doesn't want me blue, But red and white, and streaky. Old Mullins used to cultivate My learning like a gard'ner; But Giblett only thinks of lard, And not of Doctor Lardner. He does not care about my brain The value of two coppers, All that he thinks about my head Is, how I'm off for choppers. Of all my literary kin A farewell must be taken. Goodbye to the poetic Hogg! The philosophic Bacon! Day after day my lessons fade, My intellect gets muddy; A trough I have, and not a desk, A styâand not a study! Another little month, and then My progress ends, like Bunyan's; The seven sages that I loved Will be chopp'd up with onions! Then over head and ears in brine They'll souse me, like a salmon, My mathematics turn'd to brawn, My logic into gammon. My Hebrew will all retrograde, Now I'm put up to fatten, My Greek, it will all go to grease; The Dogs will have my Latin! Farewell to Oxford!âand to Bliss! To Milman, Crowe, and Glossop,â I now must be content with chats, Instead of learned gossip! Farewell to âTown!â farewell to âGown!â I've quite outgrown the latter,â Instead of Trencher-cap my head Will soon be in a platter! O why did I at Brazen-Nose Rout up the roots of knowledge? A butcher that can't read will kill A pig that's been to college! For sorrow I could stick myself, But conscience is a clasher; A thing that would be rash in man In me would be a rasher! One thing I askâwhen I am dead, And past the Stygian ditchesâ And that is, let my schoolmaster Have one of my two flitches: 'Twas he who taught my letters so I ne'er mistook or miss'd 'em, Simply by ringing at the nose, According to Bell's system. TO A BAD RIDER I Why, Mr. Rider, why Your nag so ill indorse, man? To make observers cry, You're mounted, but no horseman? II With elbows out so far, This thought you can't debar meâ Though no DragoonâHussarâ You're surely of the army! III I hope to turn M.P. You have not any notion, So awkward you would be At âseconding a motion!â MY SON AND HEIR I My mother bids me bind my heir, But not the trade where I should bind; To place a boyâthe how and whereâ It is the plague of parent-kind! II She does not hint the slightest plan, Nor what indentures to indorse; Whether to bind him to a man,â Or, like Mazeppa, to a horse. III What line to choose of likely rise, To something in the Stocks at last,â âFast bind, fast find,â the proverb cries, I find I cannot bind so fast! IV A Statesman James can never be; A Tailor?âthere I only learn His chief concern is cloth, and he Is always cutting his concern. V A Seedsman?âI'd not have him so; A Grocer's plum might disappoint; A Butcher?âno, not thatâalthough I hear âthe times are out of joint!â VI Too many of all trades there be, Like Pedlars, each has such a pack; A merchant selling coals?âwe see The buyer send to cellar back. VII A Hardware dealer?âthat might please, But if his trade's foundation leans On spikes and nails, he won't have ease When he retires upon his means. VIII A Soldier?âthere he has not nerves, A Sailor seldom lays up pelf: A Baker?âno, a baker serves, His customer before himself. IX Dresser of hair?âthat's not the sort; A Joiner jars with his desireâ A Churchman?âJames is very short, And cannot to a church aspire. X A Lawyer?âthat's a hardish term! A Publisher might give him ease, If he could into Longman's firm, Just plunge at once âin medias Rees.â XI A shop for pot, and pan, and cup, Such brittle Stock I can't advise; A Builder running houses up, Their gains are storiesâmay be lies! XII A Coppersmith I can't endureâ Nor petty Usher A, B, C-ing; A Publican, no father sure Would be the author of his being! XIII A Paper-maker?âcome he must To rags before he sells a sheetâ A Miller?âall his toil is just To make a mealâhe does not eat. XIV A Currier?âthat by favour goesâ A Chandler gives me great misgivingâ An Undertaker?âone of those That do not hope to get their living! XV Three Golden Balls?âI like them not; An Auctioneer I never didâ The victim of a slavish lot, Obliged to do as he is bid! XVI A Broker watching fall and rise Of Stock?âI'd rather deal in stone,â A Printer?âthere his toils comprise Another's work beside his own. XVII A Cooper?âneither I nor Jim Have any taste or turn for thatâ A Fish retailer?âbut with him, One part of trade is always flat. XVIII A Painter?âlong he would not live,â An Artist's a precarious craftâ In trade Apothecaries give, But very seldom take, a draught. XIX A Glazier?âwhat if he should smash! A Crispin he shall not be madeâ A Grazier may be losing cash, Although he drives âa roaring trade.â XX Well, something must be done! to look On all my little works aroundâ James is too big a boy, like book To leave upon the shelf unbound. XXI But what to do?âmy temples ache From evening's dew till morning's pearl, What course to take my boy to makeâ O could I make my boyâa girl!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHIMSICALITIES: A PERIODICAL GATHERING ANACREONTIC FOR THE NEW YEAR Come, fill up the Bowl, for if ever the glass Found a proper excuse or fit season, For toasts to be honour'd, or pledges to pass, Sure, this hour brings an exquisite reason: For hark! the last chime of the dial has ceased, And Old Time, who his leisure to cozen, Had finish'd the Months, like the flasks at a feast, Is preparing to tap a fresh dozen! Hip! Hip! and Hurrah! Then fill, all ye Happy and Free, unto whom The past year has been pleasant and sunny; Its months each as sweet as if made of the bloom Of the thyme whence the bee gathers honeyâ Days ushered by dew-drops, instead of the tears, Maybe, wrung from some wretcheder cousinâ Then fill, and with gratitude join in the cheers That triumphantly hail a fresh dozen! Hip! Hip! and Hurrah! And ye, who have met with Adversity's blast, And been bow'd to the earth by its fury; To whom the Twelve Months, that have recently pass'd, Were as harsh as a prejudiced jury,â Still, fill to the Future! and join in our chime, The regrets of remembrance to cozen, And having obtained a New Trial of Time, Shout in hopes of a kindlier dozen! Hip! Hip! and Hurrah! A MORNING THOUGHT No more, no more will I resign My couch so warm and soft, To trouble trout with hook and line, That will not spring aloft. With larks appointments one may fix To greet the dawning skies, But hang the getting up at six, For fish that will not rise! NO! No sunâno moon! No mornâno noonâ No dawnâno duskâno proper time of dayâ No skyâno earthly viewâ No distance looking blueâ No roadâno streetâno ât'other side the wayââ No end to any Rowâ No indications where the Crescents goâ No top to any steepleâ No recognitions of familiar peopleâ No courtesies for showing 'emâ No knowing 'em!â No travelling at allâno locomotion, No inkling of the wayâno notionâ âNo goââby land or oceanâ No mailâno postâ No news from any foreign coastâ No Parkâno Ringâno afternoon gentilityâ No companyâno nobilityâ No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease, No comfortable feel in any memberâ No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees, No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds,â November! TO MY DAUGHTER ON HER BIRTHDAY Dear Fanny! nine long years ago, While yet the morning sun was low, And rosy with the Eastern glow The landscape smil'dâ Whilst low'd the newly-waken'd herdsâ Sweet as the early song of birds, I heard those first, delightful words, âThou hast a Child!â Along with that uprising dew Tears glisten'd in my eyes, though few, To hail a dawning quite as new To me, as Time: It was not sorrowânot annoyâ But like a happy maid, though coy, With grief-like welcome even Joy Forestalls its prime. So mayst thou live, dear! many years, In all the bliss that life endears, Not without smiles, nor yet from tears Too strictly kept: When first thy infant littleness I folded in my fond caress, The greatest proof of happiness Was thisâI wept. EPIGRAM ON MRS. PARKES'S PAMPHLET Such strictures as these Could a learned Chinese Only read on some fine afternoon, He would cry with pale lips, âWe shall have an Eclipse For a Dragon has seized on the Moon!â THE FLOWER Alone, across a foreign plain, The Exile slowly wanders, And on his Isle beyond the main With sadden'd spirit ponders. This lovely Isle beyond the sea, With all its household treasures; Its cottage homes, its merry birds, And all its rural pleasures: Its leafy woods, its shady vales, Its moors, and purple heather; Its verdant fields bedeck'd with stars His childhood loves to gather: When lo! he starts, with glad surprise, Home-joys come rushing o'er him, For âmodest, wee, and crimson-tipp'd,â He spies the flower before him! With eager haste he stoops him down, His eyes with moisture hazy, And as he plucks the simple bloom, He murmurs, âLawk-a-daisy!â EPIGRAM: ON THE ART UNIONS That Picture-Raffles will conduce to nourish Design, or cause good Colouring to flourish, Admits of logic-chopping and wise sawing, But surely Lotteries encourage Drawing! ON LIEUTENANT EYRE'S NARRATIVE OF THE DISASTERS AT CABUL A sorry tale of sorry plans, Which this conclusion grants, That Afghan clans had all the Khans And we had all the can'ts. EPIGRAM ON A LATE CATTLE-SHOW IN SMITHFIELD Old Farmer Bull is taken sick, Yet not with any sudden trick Of fever, or his old dyspepsy; But having seen the foreign stock, It gave his system such a shock He's had a fit of Cattle-epsy! ON A CERTAIN LOCALITY Of public changes, good or ill, I seldom lead the mooters, But really Constitution Hill Should change its name with Shooter's! PARTY SPIRIT âWhy did you not dine,â said a Lord to a Wit, âWith the Whigs, you political sinner?â âWhy really I meant, but had doubts how the Pit Of my stomach would bear a Fox Dinner.â A REFLECTION ON NEW YEAR'S EVE âThose Evening Bellsâthose Evening Bells!â How sweet they used to be, and dear! When full of all that Hope foretells, Their voice proclaim'd the new-born Year! But ah! much sadder now I feel, To hear that old melodious chime, Recalling only how a Peel Has tax'd the comings-in of Time! A FIRST ATTEMPT IN RHYME If I were used to writing verse, And had a muse not so perverse, But prompt at Fancy's call to spring And carol like a bird in Spring; Or like a Bee, in summer time, That hums about a bed of thyme, And gathers honey and delights From ev'ry blossom where it 'lights; If I, alas! had such a muse, To touch the Reader or amuse, And breathe the true poetic vein, This page should not be fill'd in vain! But ah! the pow'r was never mine To dig for gems in Fancy's mine: Or wander over land and main To seek the Fairies' old domainâ To watch Apollo while he climbs His throne in oriental climes; Or mark the âgradual dusky veilâ Drawn over TempÃ©'s tuneful vale, In classic lays remember'd longâ Such flights to bolder wings belong; To Bards who on that glorious height, Of sun and song, Parnassus hight, Partake the fire divine that burns, In Milton, Pope, and Scottish Burns, Who sang his native braes and burns. For me a novice strange and new, Who ne'er such inspiration knew, But weave a verse with travail sore, Ordain'd to creep and not to soar, A few poor lines alone I write, Fulfilling thus a friendly rite, Not meant to meet the Critic's eye, For oh! to hope from such as I, For anything that's fit to read, Were trusting to a broken reed! 1st of April, 1840. E. M. G. EPIGRAM ON THE CHINESE TREATY Our wars are endedâforeign battles cease,â Great Britain owns an universal peace; And Queen Victoria triumphs over all, Still âMistress of herselfâ though China fall! THE SEASON Summer's gone and over! Fogs are falling down; And with russet tinges Autumn's doing brown. Boughs are daily rifled By the gusty thieves, And the Book of Nature Getteth short of leaves. Round the tops of houses, Swallows, as they flit, Give, like yearly tenants, Notices to quit. Skies, of fickle temper, Weep by turns, and laughâ Night and Day together Taking half-and-half. So September endethâ Cold, and most perverseâ But the month that follows Sure will pinch us worse! ON THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY TAKEN BY THE DAGUERREOTYPE Yes, there are her features! her brow, and her hair, And her eyes, with a look so seraphic, Her nose, and her mouth, with the smile that is there, Truly caught by the Art Photographic! Yet why should she borrow such aid of the skies, When by many a bosom's confession, Her own lovely face, and the light of her eyes, Are sufficient to make an impression? EPIGRAM: ON THE DEPRECIATED MONEY They may talk of the plugging and sweating Of our coinage that's minted of gold, But to me it produces no fretting Of its shortness of weight to be told: All the sov'reigns I'm able to levy As to lightness can never be wrong, But must surely be some of the heavy, For I never can carry them long. EPIGRAM Three traitors, OxfordâFrancisâBean, Have missed their wicked aim; And may all shots against the Queen, In future do the same: For why, I mean no turn of wit, But seriously insist That if Her Majesty were hit No one would be so miss'd.</field>
