      <field name="fulltext">Neo tibi cura canum fuerit postrema. Virg. Georg. III. Romanis solenne viris opus, utile famæ, Vitæque, &amp; membris. Hor. Lib. 1. Ep. XVIII. TO William Somervile, Esq; On his POEM called THE CHACE. While you, Sir, gain the Steep Ascent to Fame, And Honours due to deathless Merit claim; To a weak Muse a kind Indulgence lend, Fond with just Praise your Labours to commend, And tell the World, that Somervile's her Friend. Her Incense, guiltless of the Forms of Art, Breathes all the Huntsman's Honesty of Heart; Whose Fancy still the pleasing Scene retains Of Edric's Villa, and Ardenna's Plains: Joys, which from Change superior Charms receiv'd, The Horn hoarse sounding by the Lyre reliev'd: When the Day crown'd with rural chaste Delight, Resigns obsequious to the festive Night; The festive Night awakes th' harmonious Lay, And in sweet Verse recounts the Triumphs of the Day. Strange! that the British Muse should leave so long The Chace, the Sport of Britain's Kings, unsung! Distinguish'd Land! by Heav'n indulg'd to breed The stout, sagacious Hound, and gen'rous Steed; In vain! while yet no Bard adorn'd our Isle, To celebrate the glorious sylvan Toil. For this what darling Son shall feel thy Fire, God of th' unerring Bow, and tuneful Lyre? Our Vows are heard—Attend, ye vocal Throng, Somervile meditates th' advent'rous Song. Bold to attempt, and happy to excell, His num'rous Verse the Huntsman's Art shall tell. From him, ye British Youths, a vig'rous Race, Imbibe the various Science of the Chace; And while the well-plan'd System you admire, Know Brunswick only could the Work inspire: A Georgic Muse awaits Augustan Days, And Somerviles will sing, when Frederics give the Bays. John Nixon. TO THE AUTHOR OF The CHACE. Once more, my Friend, I touch the trembling Lyre, And in my Bosom feel poetick Fire. For thee I quit the Law's more rugged Ways, To pay my humble Tribute to thy Lays. What, tho' I daily turn each learned Sage, And labour thro' the unenlighten'd Page: Wak'd by thy Lines, the borrow'd Flames I feel, As Flints give Fire when aided by the Steel. Tho' in sulphureous Clouds of Smoke confin'd, Thy rural Scenes spring fresh into my Mind. Thy Genius in such Colours paints the Chace, The real to fictitious Joys give place. When the wild Musick charms my ravish'd Ear, How dull, how tasteless Handel's Notes appear! Even Farenelli's Self the Palm resigns, He yields—but to the Musick of thy Lines. If Friends to Poetry can yet be found, Who, without blushing, Sense prefer to Sound; Then let this soft, this Soul-enfeebling Band, These warbling Minstrels quit the beggar'd Land. They but a momentary Joy impart, 'Tis you, who touch the Soul, and warm the Heart. How tempting do thy sylvan Sports appear! Ev'n wild Ambition might vouchsafe an Ear, Might her fond Lust of Pow'r a-while compose, And gladly change it for thy sweet Repose. No fierce, unruly Senates threaten here, No Axe, no Scaffold, to the View appear, No Envy, Disappointment, and Despair. Here (blest Vicissitude!) whene'er you please, You step from Exercise to learned Ease; Turn o'er each Classick Page, each Beauty trace, The Mind unweary'd in the pleasing Chace. Oh! would kind Heav'n such Happiness bestow, Let Fools, let Knaves, be Masters here below. Grandeur and Place, those Baits to catch the Wise, And all their pageant Train, I pity and despise. J. Tracy. THE CHACE. A POEM. The Argument of the First Book. The Subject proposed. Address to his Royal Highness the Prince. The Origin of Hunting. The rude and unpolished Manner of the first Hunters. Beasts at first hunted for Food and Sacrifice. The Grant made by God to Man of the Beasts, &amp;c. The regular Manner of Hunting first brought into this Island by the Normans. The best Hounds and best Horses bred here. The Advantage of this Exercise to us, as Islanders. Address to Gentlemen of Estates. Situation of the Kennel and its several Courts. The Diversion and Employment of Hounds in the Kennel. The different Sorts of Hounds for each different Chace. Description of a perfect Hound. Of sizing and sorting of Hounds; the middle-sized Hound recommended. Of the large deep-mouth'd Hound for hunting the Stag and Otter. Of the Lime Hound; their Use on the Borders of England and Scotland. A Physical Account of Scents. Of good and bad scenting Days. A short Admonition to my Brethren of the Couples. The Chace I sing, Hounds, and their various Breed, And no less various Use. O thou Great Prince! Whom Cambria's tow'ring Hills proclaim their Lord, Deign thou to hear my bold, instructive Song. While grateful Citizens with pompous Shew Rear the triumphal Arch, rich with th' Exploits Of thy illustrious House; while Virgins pave Thy Way with Flow'rs, and, as the Royal Youth Passing they view, admire, and sigh in vain: While crowded Theatres, too fondly proud Of their exotick Minstrels, and shrill Pipes, The Price of Manhood, hail thee with a Song, And Airs soft-warbling; my hoarse-sounding Horn Invites thee to the Chace, the Sport of Kings; Image of War, without its Guilt. The Muse Aloft on Wing shall soar, conduct with Care Thy foaming Courser o'er the steepy Rock, Or on the River Bank receive thee safe, Light-bounding o'er the Wave, from Shore to Shore. Be thou our great Protector, gracious Youth! And if in future Times, some envious Prince, Careless of Right and guileful, shou'd invade Thy Britain's Commerce, or shou'd strive in vain To wrest the Balance from thy equal Hand; Thy Hunter-Train, in chearful Green array'd, (A Band undaunted, and inur'd to Toils) Shall compass thee around, die at thy Feet, Or hew thy Passage thro' th'embattled Foe, And clear thy Way to Fame; inspir'd by thee The nobler Chace of Glory shall pursue Thro' Fire, and Smoke, and Blood, and Fields of Death. Nature, in her Productions slow, aspires By just Degrees to reach Perfection's Height: So mimick Art works leisurely, 'till Time Improve the Piece, or wise Experience give The proper Finishing. When Nimrod bold, That mighty Hunter, first made War on Beasts, And stain'd the Wood-land Green with purple Dye, New and unpolish'd was the Huntsman's Art; No stated Rule, his wanton Will his Guide. With Clubs and Stones, rude Implements of War, He arm'd his savage Bands, a Multitude Untrain'd; of twining Osiers form'd, they pitch Their artless Toils, then range the desert Hills, And scowr the Plains below; the trembling Herd Start at th'unusual Sound, and clam'rous Shout Unheard before; surpriz'd, alas! to find Man now their Foe, whom erst they deem'd their Lord, But mild and gentle, and by whom as yet Secure they graz'd. Death stretches o'er the Plain Wide wasting, and grim Slaughter red with Blood: Urg'd on by Hunger keen, they wound, they kill, Their Rage licentious knows no Bound; at last Incumber'd with their Spoils, joyful they bear Upon their Shoulders broad the bleeding Prey. Part on their Altars smokes a Sacrifice To that all-gracious Pow'r, whose bounteous Hand Supports his wide Creation; what remains On living Coals they broil, inelegant Of Taste, nor skill'd as yet in nicer Arts Of pamper'd Luxury. Devotion pure, And strong Necessity, thus first began The Chace of Beasts: Tho' bloody was the Deed, Yet without Guilt. For, the green Herb alone Unequal to sustain Man's lab'ring Race, Gen. Chap. ix. ver. 3. Now ev'ry moving Thing that liv'd on Earth Was granted him for Food. So just is Heav'n, To give us in proportion to our Wants. Or Chance or Industry in After-Times Some few Improvements made, but short as yet Of due Perfection. In this Isle remote Our painted Ancestors were slow to learn, To Arms devote, of the politer Arts Nor skill'd nor studious; 'till from Neustria's Coasts Victorious William, to more decent Rules Subdu'd our Saxon Fathers, taught to speak The proper Dialect, with Horn and Voice To chear the busy Hound, whose well-known Cry His list'ning Peers approve with joint Acclaim. From him successive Huntsmen learn'd to join In bloody social Leagues, the Multitude Dispers'd, to size, to sort their various Tribes, To rear, feed, hunt, and discipline the Pack. Hail, happy Britain! highly favour'd Isle, And Heav'n's peculiar Care! To thee 'tis giv'n To train the sprightly Steed, more fleet than those Begot by Winds, or the celestial Breed That bore the great Pelides thro' the Press Of Heroes arm'd, and broke their crowded Ranks; Which proudly neighing, with the Sun begins Chearful his Course; and e'er his Beams decline, Has measur'd half thy Surface unfatigu'd. In thee alone, fair Land of Liberty! Is bred the perfect Hound, in Scent and Speed As yet unrivall'd, while in other Climes Their Virtue fails, a weak degen'rate Race. In vain malignant Steams, and Winter Fogs Load the dull Air, and hover round our Coasts, The Huntsman ever gay, robust, and bold, Defies the noxious Vapour, and confides In this delightful Exercise, to raise His drooping Herd, and chear his Heart with Joy. Ye vig'rous Youths, by smiling Fortune blest With large Demesnes, hereditary Wealth, Heap'd copious by your wise Fore-Fathers Care, Hear and attend! while I the Means reveal T' enjoy those Pleasures, for the Weak too strong, Too costly for the Poor: To rein the Steed Swift-stretching o'er the Plain, to chear the Pack Op'ning in Consorts of harmonious Joy, But breathing Death. What tho' the Gripe severe Of brazen-fisted Time, and slow Disease Creeping thro' ev'ry Vein, and Nerve unstrung, Afflict my shatter'd Frame, undaunted still, Fix'd as a Mountain Ash, that braves the Bolts Of angry Jove; tho' blasted, yet unfall'n; Still can my Soul in Fancy's Mirrour view Deeds glorious once, recal the joyous Scene In all its Splendors deck'd, o'er the full Bowl Recount my Triumphs past, urge others on With Hand and Voice, and point the winding Way: Pleas'd with that social sweet Garrulity, The poor disbanded Vet'ran's sole Delight. First let the Kennel be the Huntsman's Care, Upon some little Eminence erect, And fronting to the ruddy Dawn; its Courts On either Hand wide op'ning to receive The Sun's all-chearing Beams, when mild he shines, And gilds the Mountain Tops. For much the Pack (Rous'd from their dark Alcoves) delight to stretch, And bask, in his invigorating Ray: Warn'd by the streaming Light, and merry Lark, Forth rush the jolly Clan; with tuneful Throats They carol loud, and in grand Chorus join'd Salute the new-born Day. For not alone The vegetable World, but Men and Brutes Own his reviving Influence, and joy At his Approach. Fountain of Light! if chance Some envious Cloud veil thy refulgent Brow, In vain the Muses aid; untouch'd, unstrung, Lies my mute Harp, and thy desponding Bard Sits darkly musing o'er th'unfinish'd Lay. Let no Corinthian Pillars prop the Dome, A vain Expence, on charitable Deeds Better dispos'd, to cloath the tatter'd Wretch, Who shrinks beneath the Blast, to feed the Poor Pinch'd with afflictive Want: For Use, not State, Gracefully plain, let each Apartment rise. O'er all let Cleanliness preside, no Scraps Bestrew the Pavement, and no half-pick'd Bones, To kindle fierce Debate, or to disgust That nicer Sense, on which the Sportsman's Hope, And all his future Triumphs must depend. Soon as the growling Pack with eager Joy Have lapp'd their smoaking Viands, Morn or Eve, From the full Cistern lead the ductile Streams, To wash thy Court well-pav'd, nor spare thy Pains, For much to Health will Cleanliness avail. Seek'st thou for Hounds to climb the rocky Steep, And brush th' entangled Covert, whose nice Scent O'er greasy Fallows, and frequented Roads Can pick the dubious Way? Banish far off Each noisome Stench, let no offensive Smell Invade thy wide Inclosure, but admit The nitrous Air, and purifying Breeze. Water and Shade no less demand thy Care: In a large Square th'adjacent Field inclose, There plant in equal Ranks the spreading Elm, Or fragrant Lime; most happy thy Design, If at the Bottom of thy spacious Court A large Canal fed by the crystal Brook From its transparent Bosom shall reflect Thy downward Structure and inverted Grove. Here when the Sun's too potent Gleams annoy The crowded Kennel, and the drooping Pack, Restless and faint, loll their unmoisten'd Tongues, And drop their feeble Tails; to cooler Shades Lead forth the panting Tribe; soon shalt thou find The cordial Breeze their fainting Hearts revive: Tumultuous soon they plunge into the Stream, There lave their reeking Sides, with greedy Joy Gulp down the flying Wave, this Way and that From Shore to Shore they swim, while Clamour loud And wild Uproar torments the troubled Flood: Then on the sunny Bank they roll and stretch Their dripping Limbs, or else in wanton Rings Coursing around, pursuing and pursu'd, The merry Multitude disporting play. But here with watchful and observant Eye Attend their Frolicks, which too often end In bloody Broils and Death. High o'er thy Head Wave thy resounding Whip, and with a Voice Fierce-menacing o'er-rule the stern Debate, And quench their kindling Rage; for oft in Sport Begun, Combat ensues, growling they snarl, Then on their Haunches rear'd, rampant they seize Each other's Throats, with Teeth, and Claws, in Gore Besmear'd, they wound, they tear, 'till on the Ground, Panting, half dead the conquer'd Champion lies: Then sudden all the base ignoble Crowd Loud-clam'ring seize the helpless worry'd Wretch, And thirsting for his Blood, drag diff'rent Ways His mangled Carcase on th' ensanguin'd Plain. O Breasts of Pity void! to'oppress the Weak, To point your Vengeance at the friendless Head, And with one mutual Cry insult the Fall'n! Emblem too just of Man's degen'rate Race. Others apart by native Instinct led, Knowing Instructor! 'mong the ranker Grass Cull each salubrious Plant, with bitter Juice Concoctive stor'd, and potent to allay Each vicious Ferment. Thus the Hand divine Of Providence, beneficent and kind To all his Creatures, for the Brutes prescribes A ready Remedy, and is himself Their great Physician. Now grown stiff with Age, And many a painful Chace, the wise old Hound, Regardless of the frolick Pack, attends His Master's Side, or slumbers at his Ease Beneath the bending Shade; there many a Ring Runs o'er in Dreams; now on the doubtful Foil Puzzles perplex'd, or Doubles intricate Cautious unfolds, then wing'd with all his Speed, Bounds o'er the Lawn to seize his panting Prey: And in imperfect Whimp'rings speaks his Joy. A diff'rent Hound for ev'ry diff'rent Chace Select with Judgment; nor the tim'rous Hare O'er-match'd destroy, but leave that vile Offence To the mean, murd'rous, coursing Crew; intent On Blood and Spoil. O blast their Hopes, just Heav'n! And all their painful Drudgeries repay With Disappointment and severe Remorse. But husband thou thy Pleasures, and give Scope To all her subtle Play: By Nature led A thousand Shifts she tries; t' unravel these Th' industrious Beagle twists his waving Tail, Thro' all her Labyrinths pursues, and rings Her doleful Knell. See there with Count'nance blith, And with a courtly Grin, the fawning Hound Salutes thee cow'ring, his wide op'ning Nose Upward he curls, and his large Sloe-black Eyes Melt in soft Blandishments, and humble Joy; His glossy Skin, or Yellow-py'd, or blue, In Lights or Shades by Nature's Pencil drawn, Reflects the various Tints; his Ears and Legs Fleckt here and there, in gay enamell'd Pride, Rival the speckled Pard; his Rush-grown Tail O'er his broad Back bends in an ample Arch; On Shoulders clean, upright and firm he stands; His round Cat Foot, strait Hams, and wide-spread Thighs, And his low-dropping Chest, confess his Speed, His Strength, his Wind, or on the steepy Hill, Or far extended Plain; in ev'ry Part So well proportion'd, that the nicer Skill Of Phidias himself can't blame thy Choice. Of such compose thy Pack. But here a Mean Observe, nor the large Hound prefer, of Size Gigantick; he in the thick-woven Covert Painfully tugs, or in the thorny Brake Torn and embarrass'd bleeds: But if too small, The pigmy Brood in ev'ry Furrow swims; Moil'd in the clogging Clay, panting they lag Behind inglorious; or else shiv'ring creep Benumb'd and faint beneath the shelt'ring Thorn. For Hounds of middle Size, active and strong, Will better answer all thy various Ends, And crown thy pleasing Labours with Success. As some brave Captain, curious and exact, By his fix'd Standard forms in equal Ranks His gay Battalion, as one Man they move Step after Step, their Size the same, their Arms, Far-gleaming, dart the same united Blaze: Reviewing Generals his Merit own; How regular! How just! And all his Cares Are well repaid, if mighty George approve. So model thou thy Pack, if Honour touch Thy gen'rous Soul, and the World's just Applause. But above all take heed, nor mix thy Hounds Of diff'rent Kinds; discordant Sounds shall grate Thy Ears offended, and a lagging Line Of babling Curs disgrace thy broken Pack. But if th' amphibious Otter be thy Chace, Or stately Stag, that o'er the Woodland reigns; Or if th' harmonious Thunder of the Field Delight thy ravish'd Ears; the deep-flew'd Hound Breed up with Care, strong, heavy, slow, but sure; Whose Ears down-hanging from his thick round Head Shall sweep the Morning Dew, whose clanging Voice Awake the Mountain Echo in her Cell, And shake the Forests: The bold Talbot Kind Of these the Prime, as white as Alpine Snows; And great their Use of old. Upon the Banks Of Tweed, slow-winding thro' the Vale, the Seat Of War and Rapine once, e'er Britons knew The Sweets of Peace, or Anna's dread Commands To lasting Leagues the haughty Rivals aw'd, There dwelt a pilf'ring Race; well-train'd and skill'd In all the Misteries of Theft, the Spoil Their only Substance, Feuds and War their Sport: Not more expert in ev'ry fraudful Art Th' Arch Cacus. Virg. Æn. Lib. VIII. Felon was of old, who by the Tail Drew back his lowing Prize: In vain his Wiles, In vain the Shelter of the cov'ring Rock, In vain the sooty Cloud, and ruddy Flames That issu'd from his Mouth; for soon he paid His forfeit Life: A Debt how justly due To wrong'd Alcides, and avenging Heav'n! Veil'd in the Shades of Night they ford the Stream, Then proling far and near, whate'er they seize Becomes their Prey; nor Flocks nor Herds are safe, Nor Stalls protect the Steer, nor strong barr'd Doors Secure the fav'rite Horse. Soon as the Morn Reveals his Wrongs, with ghastly Visage wan The plunder'd Owner stands, and from his Lips A thousand thronging Curses burst their Way: He calls his stout Allies, and in a Line His faithful Hound he leads, then with a Voice That utters loud his Rage, attentive chears; Soon the sagacious Brute, his curling Tail Flourish'd in Air, low-bending plies around His busy Nose, the steaming Vapour snuffs Inquisitive, nor leaves one Turf untry'd, 'Till conscious of the recent Stains, his Heart Beats quick; his snuffling Nose, his active Tail Attest his Joy; then with deep op'ning Mouth That makes the Welkin tremble, he proclaims Th' audacious Felon; Foot by Foot he marks His winding Way, while all the list'ning Crowd Applaud his Reas'nings. O'er the wat'ry Ford, Dry sandy Heaths, and stony barren Hills, O'er beaten Paths, with Men and Beasts distain'd, Unerring he pursues; 'till at the Cot Arriv'd, and seizing by his guilty Throat The Caitif vile, redeems the captive Prey: So exquisitely delicate his Sense! Shou'd some more curious Sportsman here enquire, Whence this Sagacity, this wond'rous Pow'r Of tracing Step by Step or Man or Brute? What Guide invisible points out their Way O'er the dank Marsh, bleak Hill, and sandy Plain? The courteous Muse shall the dark Cause reveal. The Blood that from the Heart incessant rolls In many a crimson Tide, then here and there In smaller Rills disparted, as it flows Propell'd, the serous Particles evade Thro' th' open Pores, and with the ambient Air Entangling mix. As fuming Vapours rise, And hang upon the gently purling Brook, There, by th' incumbent Atmosphere compress'd, The panting Chace grows warmer as he flies, And thro' the Net-work of the Skin perspires; Leaves a long-streaming Trail behind, which by The cooler Air condens'd, remains, unless By some rude Storm dispers'd, or rarify'd By the Meridian Sun's intenser Heat. To ev'ry Shrub the warm Effluvia cling, Hang on the Grass, impregnate Earth and Skies. With Nostrils op'ning wide, o'er Hill, o'er Dale, The vig'rous Hounds pursue, with ev'ry Breath Inhale the grateful Steam, quick Pleasures sting Their tingling Nerves, while they their Thanks repay, And in triumphant Melody confess The titillating Joy. Thus on the Air Depend the Hunter's Hopes. When ruddy Streaks At Eve forebode a blust'ring stormy Day, Or low'ring Clouds blacken the Mountain's Brow; When nipping Frosts, and the keen biting Blasts Of the dry parching East, menace the Trees With tender Blossoms teeming, kindly spare Thy sleeping Pack, in their warm Beds of Straw Low-sinking at their Ease; listless they shrink Into some dark Recess, nor hear thy Voice Tho' oft invok'd; or haply if thy Call Rouze up the slumb'ring Tribe, with heavy Eyes Glaz'd, lifeless, dull, downward they drop their Tails Inverted; high on their bent Backs erect Their pointed Bristles stare, or 'mong the Tufts Of ranker Weeds, each Stomach-healing Plant Curious they crop, sick, spiritless, forlorn. These inauspicious Days, on other Cares Employ thy precious Hours; th' improving Friend With open Arms embrace, and from his Lips Glean Science, season'd with good-natur'd Wit. But if th' inclement Skies, and angry Jove Forbid the pleasing Intercourse, thy Books Invite thy ready Hand, each sacred Page Rich with the wise Remarks of Heroes old. Converse familiar with th' illustrious Dead; With great Examples of old Greece or Rome Enlarge thy free-born Heart, and bless kind Heav'n, That Britain yet enjoys dear Liberty, That Balm of Life, that sweetest Blessing, cheap Tho' purchas'd wih our Blood. Well-bred, polite, Credit thy Calling. See! how mean, how low, The bookless saunt'ring Youth, proud of the Skut That dignifies his Cap, his flourish'd Belt, And rusty Couples gingling by his Side. Be thou of other Mold; and know that such Transporting Pleasures were by Heav'n ordain'd Wisdom's Relief, and Virtue's great Reward. BOOK the Second The Argument of the Second Book. Of the Power of Instinct in Brutes. Two remarkable Instances in the Hunting of the Roebuck, and in the Hare going to Seat in the Morning. Of the Variety of Seats or Forms of the Hare, according to the Change of the Season, Weather, or Wind. Description of the Hare-hunting in all its Parts, interspers'd with Rules to be observ'd by those who follow that Chace. Transition to the Asiatick Way of Hunting, particularly the magnificent Manner of the Great Mogul, and other Tartarian Princes, taken from Monsieur Bernier, and the History of Gengiskan the Great. Concludes with a short Reproof of Tyrants and Oppressors of Mankind. Nor will it less delight th' attentive Sage T' observe that Instinct, which unerring guides The brutal Race, which mimicks Reason's Lore, And oft transcends: Heav'n-taught the Roe-buck swift Loiters at Ease before the driving Pack, And mocks their vain Pursuit, nor far he flies But checks his Ardour, 'till the steaming Scent That freshens on the Blade, provokes their Rage. Urg'd to their Speed, his weak deluded Foes Soon flag fatigu'd; strain'd to Excess each Nerve, Each slacken'd Sinew fails; they pant, they foam; Then o'er the Lawn he bounds, o'er the high Hills Stretches secure, and leaves the scatter'd Crowd To puzzle in the distant Vale below. 'Tis Instinct that directs the jealous Hare To chuse her soft Abode: With Step revers'd She forms the doubling Maze; then, e'er the Morn Peeps thro' the Clouds, leaps to her close Recess. As wand'ring Shepherds on th' Arabian Plains No settled Residence observe, but shift Their moving Camp, now, on some cooler Hill With Cedars crown'd, court the refreshing Breeze; And then, below, where trickling Streams distill From some penurious Source, their Thirst allay, And feed their fainting Flocks: So the wise Hares Oft quit their Seats, lest some more curious Eye Shou'd mark their Haunts, and by dark treach'rous wiles Plot their Destruction; or perchance in hopes Of plenteous Forage, near the ranker Mead, Or matted Blade, wary, and close they sit. When Spring shines forth, Season of Love and Joy, In the moist Marsh, 'mong Beds of Rushes hid, They cool their boiling Blood: When Summer Suns Bake the cleft Earth, to thick wide-waving Fields Of Corn full-grown, they lead their helpless Young: But when autumnal Torrents, and fierce Rains Deluge the Vale, in the dry crumbling Bank Their Forms they delve, and cautiously avoid The dripping Covert: Yet when Winter's Cold Their Limbs benumbs, thither with Speed return'd In the long Grass they skulk, or shrinking creep Among the wither'd Leaves; thus changing still, As Fancy prompts them, or as Food invites. But ev'ry Season carefully observ'd, Th' inconstant Winds, the fickle Element, The wise experienc'd Huntsman soon may find His subtle, various Game, nor waste in vain His tedious Hours, 'till his impatient Hounds, With Disappointment vex'd, each springing Lark Babbling pursue, far scatter'd o'er the Fields. Now golden Autumn from her open Lap Her fragrant Bounties show'rs; the Fields are shorn; Inwardly smiling the proud Farmer views The rising Pyramids that grace his Yard, And counts his large Increase; his Barns are stor'd, And groaning Staddles bend beneath their Load. All now is free as Air, and the gay Pack In the rough bristly Stubbles range unblam'd; No Widow's Tears o'erflow, no secret Curse Swells in the Farmer's Breast, which his pale Lips Trembling conceal, by his fierce Landlord aw'd: But courteous now he levels ev'ry Fence, Joins in the common Cry, and hollows loud, Charm'd with the rattling Thunder of the Field. Oh bear me, some kind Pow'r invisible! To that extended Lawn, where the gay Court View the swift Racers stretching to the Goal; Games more renown'd, and a far nobler Train, Than proud Elean Fields could boast of old. Oh! were a Theban Lyre not wanting here, And Pindar's Voice, to do their Merit right! Or to those spacious Plains, where the strain'd Eye, In the wide Prospect lost, beholds at last Sarum's proud Spire, that o'er the Hills ascends, And pierces through the Clouds. Or to thy Downs, Fair Cotswold, where the well-breath'd Beagle climbs, With matchless Speed, thy green aspiring Brow, And leaves the lagging Multitude behind. Hail, gentle Dawn! Mild blushing Goddess, hail! Rejoic'd I see thy purple Mantle spread O'er half the Skies, Gems pave thy radiant Way, And Orient Pearls from ev'ry Shrub depend. Farewell, Cleora; here deep sunk in Down Slumber secure, with happy Dreams amus'd, 'Till grateful Steams shall tempt thee to receive Thy early Meal, or thy officious Maids, The Toilet plac'd, shall urge thee to perform Th' important Work. Me other Joys invite, The Horn sonorous calls, the Pack awak'd Their Mattins chant, nor brook my long Delay. My Courser hears their Voice; see there with Ears And Tail erect, neighing he paws the Ground; Fierce Rapture kindles in his red'ning Eyes, And boils in ev'ry Vein. As captive Boys, Cow'd by the ruling Rod, and haughty Frowns Of Pedagogues severe, from their hard Tasks If once dismiss'd, no Limits can contain The Tumult rais'd within their little Breasts, But give a Loose to all their frolick Play: So from their Kennel rush the joyous Pack; A thousand wanton Gayeties express Their inward Extasy, their pleasing Sport Once more indulg'd, and Liberty restor'd. The rising Sun, that o'er the Horizon peeps, As many Colours from their glossy Skins Beaming reflects, as paint the various Bow When April Show'rs descend. Delightful Scene! Where all around is gay, Men, Horses, Dogs, And in each smiling Countenance appears Fresh-blooming Health, and universal Joy. Huntsman, lead on! behind, the clust'ring Pack Submiss attend, hear with Respect thy Whip Loud-clanging, and thy harsher Voice obey: Spare not the straggling Cur, that wildly roves; But let thy brisk Assistant on his Back Imprint thy just Resentments; let each Lash Bite to the Quick, 'till howling he return, And whining creep amid the trembling Crowd. Here, on this verdant Spot, where Nature kind With double Blessings crowns the Farmer's Hopes; Where Flow'rs autumnal spring, and the rank Mead Affords the wand'ring Hares a rich Repast; Throw off thy ready Pack. See, where they spread And range around, and dash the glitt'ring Dew. If some stanch Hound, with his authentick Voice, Avow the recent Trail, the justling Tribe Attend his Call, then with one mutual Cry The welcome News confirm, and echoing Hills Repeat the pleasing Tale. See how they thread The Brakes, and up yon Furrow drive along! But quick they back recoil, and wisely check Their eager Haste; then o'er the fallow'd Ground How leisurely they work, and many a Pause Th' harmonious Consort breaks; 'till more assur'd With Joy redoubled the low Valleys ring. What artful Labyrinths perplex their Way! Ah! there she lies; how close! she pants, she doubts If now she lives; she trembles as she sits, With Horror seiz'd. The wither'd Grass that clings Around her Head, of the same russet Hue, Almost deceiv'd my Sight, had not her Eyes With Life full-beaming her vain Wiles betray'd. At Distance draw thy Pack, let all be hush'd, No Clamour loud, no frantick Joy be heard, Lest the wild Hound run gadding o'er the Plain Untractable, nor hear thy chiding Voice. Now gently put her off; see how direct To her known Mews she flies! Here, Huntsman, bring (But without Hurry) all thy jolly Hounds, And calmly lay them in. How low they stoop, And seem to plough the Ground! then all at once With greedy Nostrils snuff the fuming Steam That glads their flutt'ring Hearts. As Winds let loose From the dark Caverns of the blust'ring God, They burst away, and sweep the dewy Lawn. Hope gives them Wings, while she's spur'd on by Fear. The Welkin rings, Men, Dogs, Hills, Rocks, and Woods In the full Consort join. Now, my brave Youths, Stripp'd for the Chace, give all your Souls to Joy! See how their Coursers, than the Mountain Roe More fleet, the verdant Carpet skim, thick Clouds Snorting they breathe, their shining Hoofs scarce print The Grass unbruis'd; with Emulation fir'd They strain to lead the Field, top the barr'd Gate, O'er the deep Ditch exulting bound, and brush The Thorny-twining Hedge: The Riders bend O'er their arch'd Necks; with steddy Hands, by turns Indulge their Speed, or moderate their Rage. Where are their Sorrows, Disappointments, Wrongs, Vexations, Sickness, Cares? All, all are gone, And with the panting Winds lag far behind. Huntsman! her Gait observe, if in wide Rings She wheel her mazy Way, in the same Round Persisting still, she'll foil the beaten Track. But if she fly, and with the fav'ring Wind Urge her bold Course; less intricate thy Task: Push on thy Pack. Like some poor exil'd Wretch The frighted Chase leaves her late dear Abodes, O'er Plains remote she stretches far away, Ah! never to return! For greedy Death Hov'ring exults, secure to seize his Prey. Hark! from yon Covert, where those tow'ring Oaks Above the humble Copse aspiring rise, What glorious Triumphs burst in ev'ry Gale Upon our ravish'd Ears! The Hunters shout The clanging Horns swell their sweet-winding Notes, The Pack wide-op'ning load the trembling Air With various Melody; from Tree to Tree The propagated Cry redoubling bounds, And winged Zephyrs waft the floating Joy Thro' all the Regions near: Afflictive Birch No more the School-boy dreads, his Prison broke, Scamp'ring he flies, nor heeds his Master's Call; The weary Traveller forgets his Road, And climbs th' adjacent Hill; the Ploughman leaves Th' unfinish'd Furrow; nor his bleating Flocks Are now the Shepherd's Joy; Men, Boys, and Girls Desert th' unpeopled Village; and wild Crowds Spread o'er the Plain, by the sweet Frenzy seiz'd. Look, how she pants! and o'er yon op'ning Glade Slips glancing by; while, at the further End, The puzzling Pack unravel Wile by Wile, Maze within Maze. The Covert's utmost Bound Slily she skirts; behind them cautious creeps, And in that very Track, so lately stain'd By all the steaming Crowd, seems to pursue The Foe she flies. Let Cavillers deny That Brutes have Reason; sure 'tis something more, 'Tis Heav'n directs, and Stratagems inspires, Beyond the short Extent of human Thought. But hold—I see her from the Covert break; Sad on yon little Eminence she sits; Intent she listens with one Ear erect, Pond'ring, and doubtful what new Course to take, And how t' escape the fierce blood-thirsty Crew, That still urge on, and still in Vollies loud Insult her Woes, and mock her sore Distress. As now in louder Peals the loaded Winds Bring on the gath'ring Storm, her Fears prevail; And o'er the Plain, and o'er the Mountain's Ridge, Away she flies; nor Ships with Wind and Tide, And all their Canvas Wings scud half so fast. Once more, ye jovial Train, your Courage try, And each clean Courser's Speed. We scowr along, In pleasing Hurry and Confusion tost; Oblivion to be wish'd! The patient Pack Hang on the Scent unweary'd, up they climb, And ardent we pursue; our lab'ring Steeds We press, we gore; till once the Summit gain'd, Painfully panting, there we breathe awhile; Then like a foaming Torrent, pouring down Precipitant, we smoke along the Vale. Happy the Man, who with unrival'd Speed Can pass his Fellows, and with Pleasure view The struggling Pack; how in the rapid Course Alternate they preside, and justling push To guide the dubious Scent; how giddy Youth Oft babbling errs, by wiser Age reprov'd; How, niggard of his Strength, the wise old Hound Hangs in the Rear, 'till some important Point Rouse all his Diligence, or 'till the Chace Sinking he finds; then to the Head he springs With Thirst of Glory fir'd, and wins the Prize. Huntsman, take heed; they stop in full Career. Yon crowning Flocks, that at a Distance gaze, Have haply foil'd the Turf. See! that old Hound, How busily he works, but dares not trust His doubtful Sense; draw yet a wider Ring. Hark! now again the Chorus fills. As Bells Sally'd awhile at once their Peal renew, And high in Air the tuneful Thunder rolls. See, how they toss, with animated Rage Recov'ring all they lost!—That eager Haste Some doubling Wile foreshews.—Ah! yet once more They're check'd—hold back with Speed—on either Hand They flourish round—ev'n yet persist—'Tis right, Away they spring; the rustling Stubbles bend Beneath the driving Storm. Now the poor Chace Begins to flag, to her last Shifts reduc'd. From Brake to Brake she flies, and visits all Her well-known Haunts, where once she rang'd secure, With Love and Plenty blest. See! there she goes, She reels along, and by her Gait betrays Her inward Weakness. See, how black she looks! The Sweat, that clogs th' obstructed Pores, scarce leaves A languid Scent. And now in open View See, see, she flies! each eager Hound exerts His utmost Speed, and stretches ev'ry Nerve. How quick she turns! their gaping Jaws eludes, And yet a Moment lives; 'till round inclos'd By all the greedy Pack, with infant Screams She yields her Breath, and there reluctant dies. So when the furious Bacchanals assail'd Threician Orpheus, poor ill-fated Bard! Loud was the Cry, Hills, Woods, and Hebrus' Banks Return'd their clam'rous Rage; distress'd he flies, Shifting from Place to Place, but flies in vain; For eager they pursue, 'till panting, faint, By noisy Multitudes o'erpow'r'd, he sinks, To the relentless Crowd a bleeding Prey. The Huntsman now, a deep Incision made, Shakes out with Hands impure, and dashes down Her reeking Entrails, and yet quiv'ring Heart. These claim the Pack, the bloody Perquisite For all their Toils. Stretch'd on the Ground she lies, A mangled Coarse; in her dim glaring Eyes Cold Death exults, and stiffens ev'ry Limb. Aw'd by the threat'ning Whip, the furious Hounds Around her bay; or at their Master's Foot, Each happy Fav'rite courts his kind Applause, With humble Adulation cow'ring low. All now is Joy. With Cheeks full-blown they wind Her solemn Dirge, while the loud-op'ning Pack The Concert swell, and Hills and Dales return The sadly-pleasing Sounds. Thus the poor Hare, A puny, dastard Animal, but vers'd In subtle Wiles, diverts the youthful Train. But if thy proud, aspiring Soul disdains So mean a Prey, delighted with the Pomp, Magnificence, and Grandeur of the Chace; Hear what the Muse from faithful Records sings. Why on the Banks of Gemma, Indian Stream, Line within Line, rise the Pavilions proud, Their silken Streamers waving in the Wind? Why neighs the warrior Horse? From Tent to Tent Why press in Crowds the buzzing Multitude? Why shines the polish'd Helm, and pointed Lance, This Way and that far-beaming o'er the Plain? Nor Visapour nor Golconda rebel! Nor the great Sophy with his num'rous Host Lays waste the Provinces; nor Glory fires To rob, and to destroy, beneath the Name And specious Guise of War. A nobler Cause Calls Aurengzebe to Arms. No Cities sack'd, No Mother's Tears, no helpless Orphan's Cries, No violated Leagues with sharp Remorse Shall sting the conscious Victor: But Mankind Shall hail him good and just. For 'tis on Beasts He draws his vengeful Sword; on Beasts of Prey Full-fed with human Gore. See, see, he comes! Imperial Dehli, op'ning wide her Gates, Pours out her thronging Legions, bright in Arms, And all the Pomp of War. Before them sound Clarions and Trumpets, breathing martial Airs, And bold Defiance. High upon his Throne, Born on the Back of his proud Elephant, Sits the great Chief of Tamur's glorious Race: Sublime he sits, amid the radiant Blaze Of Gems and Gold. Omrahs about him crowd, And rein th' Arabian Steed, and watch his Nod: And potent Rajahs, who themselves preside O'er Realms of wide Extent; but here submiss Their Homage pay, alternate Kings and Slaves. Next these, with prying Eunuchs girt around, The fair Sultanas of his Court; a Troop Of chosen Beauties, but with Care conceal'd From each intrusive Eye; one Look is Death. Ah cruel Eastern Law! (had Kings a Pow'r But equal to their wild tyrannick Will) To rob us of the Sun's all-chearing Ray Were less severe. The Vulgar close the March, Slaves and Artificers; and Dehli mourns Her empty and depopulated Streets. Now at the Camp arriv'd, with stern Review, Thro' Groves of Spears, from File to File he darts His sharp experienc'd Eye; their Order marks, Each in his Station rang'd exact and firm, 'Till in the boundless Line his Sight is lost. Not greater Multitudes in Arms appear'd, On these extended Plains, when Ammon's Son With mighty Porus in dread Battle join'd, The Vassal World the Prize. Nor was that Host More numerous of old, which the great Xerxes. King Pour'd out on Greece from all th' unpeopled East; That bridg'd the Hellespont from Shore to Shore, And drank the Rivers dry. Mean while in Troops The busy Hunter-Train mark out the Ground, A wide Circumference; full many a League In Compass round; Woods, Rivers, Hills, and Plains, Large Provinces; enough to gratify Ambition's highest Aim, could Reason bound Man's erring Will. Now sit in close Divan The mighty Chiefs of this prodigious Host. He from the Throne high-eminent presides, Gives out his Mandates proud, Laws of the Chace, From ancient Records drawn. With Rev'rence low, And prostrate at his Feet, the Chiefs receive His irreversible Decrees, from which To vary is to die. Then his brave Bands Each to his Station leads; encamping round, 'Till the wide Circle is compleatly form'd. Where decent Order reigns, what these command, Those execute with Speed, and punctual Care; In all the strictest Discipline of War: As if some watchful Foe, with bold Insult, Hung low'ring o'er their Camp. The high Resolve, That flies on Wings, thro' all th' encircling Line, Each Motion steers, and animates the Whole. So by the Sun's attractive Pow'r controll'd, The Planets in their Spheres roll round his Orb, On all he shines, and rules the great Machine. E'er yet the Morn dispels the fleeting Mists, The Signal giv'n by the loud Trumpet's Voice, Now high in Air th' Imperial Standard waves, Emblazon'd rich with Gold, and glitt'ring Gems; And like a Sheet of Fire, thro' the dun Gloom Streaming meteorous. The Soldiers Shouts, And all the brazen Instruments of War, With mutual Clamour, and united Din, Fill the large Concave. While from Camp to Camp They catch the vary'd Sounds floating in Air. Round all the wide Circumference, Tygers fell Shrink at the Noise; deep in his gloomy Den The Lion starts, and Morsels yet unchew'd Drop from his trembling Jaws. Now all at once Onward they march embattled, to the Sound Of martial Harmony, Fifes, Cornets, Drums, That rouse the sleepy Soul to Arms, and bold Heroick Deeds. In Parties here and there Detach'd o'er Hill and Dale, the Hunters range Inquisitive; strong Dogs, that match in Fight The boldest Brute, around their Masters wait, A faithful Guard. No Haunt unsearch'd, they drive From ev'ry Covert, and from ev'ry Den, The lurking Savages. Incessant Shouts Re-echo thro' the Woods, and kindling Fire Gleams from the Mountain Tops; the Forest seems One mingling Blaze: Like Flocks of Sheep they fly Before the flaming Brand: Fierce Lions, Pards, Boars, Tygers, Bears, and Wolves; a dreadful Crew Of grim blood-thirsty Foes: growling along, They stalk indignant; but fierce Vengeance still Hangs pealing on their Rear, and pointed Spears Present immediate Death. Soon as the Night Wrapt in her sable Veil forbids the Chace, They pitch their Tents, in even Ranks, around The circling Camp. The Guards are plac'd, and Fires At proper Distances ascending rise, And paint th' Horizon with their ruddy Light. So round some Island's Shore of large Extent, Amid the gloomy Horrors of the Night, The Billows breaking on the pointed Rocks, Seem all one Flame, and the bright Circuit wide Appears a Bulwark of surrounding Fire. What dreadful Howlings, and what hideous Roar, Disturb those peaceful Shades! where erst the Bird, That glads the Night, had chear'd the list'ning Groves With sweet Complainings. Thro' the silent Gloom Oft they the Guards assail; as oft repell'd They fly reluctant, with hot-boiling Rage Stung to the Quick, and mad with wild Despair. Thus Day by Day, they still the Chace renew; At Night encamp; 'till now in streighter Bounds The Circle lessens, and the Beasts perceive The Wall that hems them in on ev'ry Side, And now their Fury bursts, and knows no Mean; From Man they turn, and point their ill-judg'd Rage Against their Fellow-Brutes. With Teeth and Claws The Civil War begins; grappling they tear. Lions on Tygers prey, and Bears on Wolves: Horrible Discord! 'Till the Crowd behind Shouting pursue, and part the bloody Fray. At once their Wrath subsides; tame as the Lamb The Lion hangs his Head, the furious Pard, Cow'd and subdu'd, flies from the Face of Man, Nor bears one Glance of his commanding Eye. So abject is a Tyrant in Distress. At last within the narrow Plain confin'd, A listed Field, mark'd out for bloody Deeds, An Amphitheatre more glorious far Than ancient Rome could boast, they crowd in Heaps, Dismay'd, and quite appall'd. In meet Array, Sheath'd in refulgent Arms, a noble Band Advance; great Lords of high imperial Blood, Early resolv'd t' assert their Royal Race, And prove by glorious Deeds their Valour's Growth Mature, e'er yet the callow Down has spread Its curling Shade. On bold Arabian Steeds With decent Pride they sit, that fearless hear The Lion's dreadful Roar; and down the Rock Swift-shooting plunge, or o'er the Mountain's Ridge Stretching along, the greedy Tyger leave Panting behind. On Foot their faithful Slaves With Jav'lins arm'd attend; each watchful Eye Fix'd on his youthful Care, for him alone He fears, and to redeem his Life unmov'd Wou'd lose his own. The mighty Aurengzebe, From his high-elevated Throne, beholds His blooming Race; revolving in his Mind What once he was, in his gay Spring of Life, When Vigour strung his Nerves. Parental Joy Melts in his Eyes, and flushes in his Cheeks. Now the loud Trumpet sounds a Charge. The Shouts Of eager Hosts, thro' all the circling Line, And the wild Howlings of the Beasts within Rend wide the Welkin, Flights of Arrows, wing'd With Death, and Jav'lins lanc'd from ev'ry Arm, Gall sore the brutal Bands, with many a Wound Gor'd thro' and thro'. Despair at last prevails, When fainting Nature shrinks, and rouses all Their drooping Courage. Swell'd with furious Rage, Their Eyes dart Fire; and on the youthful Band They rush implacable. They their broad Shields Quick interpose; on each devoted Head Their flaming Falchions, as the Bolts of Jove, Descend unerring. Prostrate on the Ground The grinning Monsters lie, and their foul Gore Defiles the verdant Plain. Nor idle stand The trusty Slaves; with pointed Spears they pierce Thro' their tough Hides; or at their gaping Mouths An easier Passage find. The King of Brutes In broken Roarings breathes his last; the Bear Grumbles in Death; nor can his spotted Skin, Tho' sleek it shine, with vary'd Beauties gay, Save the proud Pard from unrelenting Fate. The Battle bleeds, grim Slaughter strides along, Glutting her greedy Jaws, grins o'er her Prey. Men, Horses, Dogs, fierce Beasts of ev'ry kind, A strange promiscuous Carnage, drench'd in Blood, And Heaps on Heaps amass'd. What yet remain Alive, with vain Assault contend to break Th' impenetrable Line. Others, whom Fear Inspires with self-preserving Wiles, beneath The Bodies of the Slain for Shelter creep. Aghast they fly, or hide their Heads dispers'd. And now perchance (had Heav'n but pleas'd) the Work Of Death had been compleat; and Aurengzebe By one dread Frown extinguish'd half their Race. When lo! the bright Sultanas of his Court Appear, and to his ravish'd Eyes display Those Charms, but rarely to the Day reveal'd. Lowly they bend, and humbly sue, to save The vanquish'd Host. What Mortal can deny When suppliant Beauty begs? At his Command Op'ning to Right and Left, the well-train'd Troops Leave a large Void for their retreating Foes. Away they fly, on Wings of Fear upborn, To seek on distant Hills their late Abodes. Ye proud Oppressors, whose vain Hearts exult In Wantonness of Pow'r, 'gainst the brute Race, Fierce Robbers like yourselves, a guiltless War Wage uncontroll'd: Here quench your Thirst of Blood; But learn from Aurengzebe to spare Mankind. BOOK the Third The Argument of the Third Book. Of King Edgar and his imposing a Tribute of Wolves Heads upon the Kings of Wales: From hence a Transition to Fox-Hunting, which is described in all its Parts. Censure of an overnumerous Pack. Of the several Engines to destroy Foxes, and other Wild Beasts. The Steel-Trap described, and the Manner of using it. Description of the Pitfall for the Lion; and another for the Elephant. The ancient Way of hunting the Tyger with a Mirror. The Arabian Manner of hunting the Wild Boar. Description of the Royal Stag-Chace at Windsor-Forest. Concludes with an Address to his Majesty, and an Eulogy upon Mercy. In Albion's Isle when glorious Edgar reign'd, He, wisely provident, from her white Cliffs Launch'd half her Forests, and with num'rous Fleets Cover'd his wide Domain: There proudly rode Lord of the Deep, the great Prerogative Of British Monarchs. Each Invader bold, Dane and Norwegian, at a Distance gaz'd, And, disappointed, gnash'd his Teeth in vain. He scour'd the Seas, and to remotest Shores With swelling Sails the trembling Corsair fled. Rich Commerce flourish'd; and with busy Oars Dash'd the resounding Surge. Nor less at Land His Royal Cares; wise, potent, gracious Prince! His Subjects from their cruel Foes he sav'd, And from rapacious Savages their Flocks. Cambria's proud Kings (tho' with Reluctance) paid Their tributary Wolves; Head after Head, In full Account, 'till the Woods yield no more, And all the rav'nous Race extinct is lost. In fertile Pastures more securely graz'd The social Troops; and soon their large Increase With curling Fleeces whiten'd all the Plains. But yet, alas! the wily Fox remain'd, A subtle, pilf'ring Foe, prowling around In Midnight Shades, and wakeful to destroy. In the full Fold, the poor defenceless Lamb, Seiz'd by his guileful Arts, with sweet, warm Blood Supplies a rich Repast. The mournful Ewe, Her dearest Treasure lost, thro the dun Night Wanders perplex'd, and darkling bleats in vain: While in th' adjacent Bush poor Philomel, (Herself a Parent once, 'till wanton Churls Despoil'd her Nest) joins in her loud Laments, With sweeter Notes, and more melodious Woe. For these nocturnal Thieves, Huntsman, prepare Thy sharpest Vengeance. Oh! how glorious 'tis To right th' oppress'd, and bring the Felon vile To just Disgrace! E'er yet the Morning peep, Or Stars retire from the first Blush of Day, With thy far echoing Voice alarm thy Pack, And rouse thy bold Compeers. Then to the Copse, Thick with entangling Grass, or prickly Furze With Silence lead thy many-colour'd Hounds, In all their Beauty's Pride. See! how they range Dispers'd, how busily this Way and that, They cross, examining with curious Nose Each likely Haunt. Hark! on the Drag I hear Their doubtful Notes, preluding to a Cry More nobly full, and swell'd with ev'ry Mouth. As straggling Armies, at the Trumpet's Voice, Press to their Standard; hither all repair, And hurry thro' the Woods; with hasty Step Rustling, and full of Hope; now driv'n on Heaps They push, they strive; while from his Kennel sneaks The conscious Villain. See! he skulks along, Sleek at the Shepherd's Cost, and plump with Meals Purloin'd. So thrive the Wicked here below. Tho' high his Brush he bear, tho' tipt with White It gayly shine; yet e'er the Sun declin'd Recall the Shades of Night, the pamper'd Rogue Shall rue his Fate revers'd; and at his Heels Behold the just Avenger, swift to seize His forfeit Head, and thirsting for his Blood. Heav'ns! what melodious Strains! how beat our Hearts, Big with tumultuous Joy! the loaded Gales Breathe Harmony; and as the Tempest drives From Wood to Wood, thro' ev'ry dark Recess The Forest thunders, and the Mountains shake. The Chorus swells; less various, and less sweet The trilling Notes, when in those very Groves The feather'd Choristers salute the Spring, And ev'ry Bush in Consort joins; or when The Master's Hand, in modulated Air, Bids the loud Organ breathe, and all the Pow'rs Of Musick in one Instrument combine, An universal Minstrelsy. And now In vain each Earth he tries, the Doors are barr'd Impregnable, nor is the Covert safe; He pants for purer Air. Hark! what loud Shouts Re-echo thro' the Groves! he breaks away, Shrill Horns proclaim his Flight. Each straggling Hound Strains o'er the Lawn to reach the distant Pack. 'Tis Triumph all and Joy. Now, my brave Youths, Now give a Loose to the clean gen'rous Steed; Flourish the Whip, nor spare the galling Spur; But in the Madness of Delight, forget Your Fears. Far o'er the rocky Hills we range, And dangerous our Course; but in the Brave True Courage never fails. In vain the Stream In foaming Eddies whirls; in vain the Ditch Wide-gaping threatens Death. The craggy Steep Where the poor dizzy Shepherd crawls with Care, And clings to ev'ry Twig, gives us no Pain; But down we sweep, as stoops the Falcon bold To pounce his Prey. Then up th' opponent Hill, By the swift Motion slung, we mount aloft. So Ships in Winter-Seas now sliding sink Adown the steepy Wave, then, toss'd on high, Ride on the Billows, and defy the Storm. What Lengths we pass! where will the wand'ring Chace Lead us bewilder'd! smooth as Swallows skim The new-shorn Mead, and far more swift we fly. See my brave Pack; how to the Head they press, Justling in close Array, then more diffuse Obliquely wheel, while from their op'ning Mouths The volly'd Thunder breaks. So when the Cranes Their annual Voyage steer, with wanton Wing Their Figure oft they change, and their loud Clang From Cloud to Cloud rebounds. How far behind The Hunter-Crew, wide-straggling o'er the Plain! The panting Courser now with trembling Nerves Begins to reel; urg'd by the goring Spur, Makes many a faint Effort: He snorts, he foams, The big round Drops run trickling down his Sides, With Sweat and Blood distain'd. Look back and view The strange Confusion of the Vale below, Where sowr Vexation reigns; see yon poor Jade, In vain th' impatient Rider frets and swears, With galling Spurs harrows his mangled Sides; He can no more: His stiff unpliant Limbs Rooted in Earth, unmov'd and fix'd he stands, For ev'ry cruel Curse returns a Groan, And sobs, and faints, and dies. Who without Grief Can view that pamper'd Steed, his Master's Joy, His Minion, and his daily Care, well cloath'd, Well fed with ev'ry nicer Cate; no Cost, No Labour spar'd; who, when the flying Chace Broke from the Copse, without a Rival led The num'rous Train: Now a sad Spectacle Of Pride brought low, and humbled Insolence, Drove like a pannier'd Ass, and scourg'd along. While these with loosen'd Reins, and dangling Heels, Hang on their reeling Palfreys, that scarce bear Their Weights; another in the treach'rous Bog Lies flound'ring, half ingulph'd. What biting Thoughts Torment th' abandon'd Crew! Old Age laments His Vigour spent: The tall, plump, brawny Youth Curses his cumb'rous Bulk; and envies now The short Pygmean Race, he whilom kenn'd With proud insulting Leer. A chosen few Alone the Sport enjoy, nor droop beneath Their pleasing Toils, Here, Huntsman, from this Height Observe yon Birds of Prey; if I can judge, 'Tis there the Villain lurks; they hover round, And claim him as their own. Was I not right; See! there he creeps along; his Brush he drags, And sweeps the Mire impure; from his wide Jaws His Tongue unmoisten'd hangs; Symptoms too sure Of sudden Death. Hah! yet he flies, nor yields To black Despair. But one Loose more, and all His Wiles are vain. Hark! thro' yon Village now The rattling Clamour rings. The Barns, the Cots, And leafless Elms return the joyous Sounds. Thro' ev'ry Homestall, and thro' ev'ry Yard, His Midnight Walks, panting, forlorn, he flies; Thro' ev'ry Hole he sneaks, thro' ev'ry Jakes Plunging he wades besmear'd, and fondly hopes In a superior Stench to lose his own: But, faithful to the Track, th' unerring Hounds With Peals of echoing Vengeance close pursue. And now distress'd, no shelt'ring Covert near Into the Hen-roost creeps, whose Walls with Gore Distain'd attest his Guilt. There, Villain, there Expect thy Fate deserv'd. And soon from thence The Pack inquisitive, with Clamour loud, Drag out their trembling Prize; and on his Blood With greedy Transport feast. In bolder Notes Each sounding Horn proclaims the Felon dead: And all th' assembled Village shouts for Joy. The Farmer, who beholds his mortal Foe Stretch'd at his Feet, applauds the glorious Deed, And grateful calls us to a short Repast; In the full Glass the liquid Amber smiles, Our native Product. And his good old Mate With choicest Viands heaps the lib'ral Board, To crown our Triumphs, and reward our Toils. Here must th'instructive Muse (but with Respect) Censure that num'rous Pack, that Crowd of State With which the vain Profusion of the Great Covers the Lawn, and shakes the trembling Copse. Pompous Incumbrance! A Magnificence Useless, vexatious! For the wily Fox, Safe in th' increasing Number of his Foes, Kens well the great Advantage: Slinks behind, And slily creeps thro' the same beaten Track, And hunts them Step by Step; then views, escap'd, With inward Extasy, the panting Throng In their own Footsteps puzzled, foil'd, and lost. So when proud Eastern Kings summon to Arms Their gaudy Legions, from far distant Climes They flock in Crowds, unpeopling half a World: But when the Day of Battle calls them forth To charge the well-train'd Foe, a Band compact Of chosen Vet'rans; they press blindly on, In Heaps confus'd by their own Weapons fall, A smoking Carnage scatter'd o'er the Plain. Nor Hounds alone this noxious Brood destroy: The plunder'd Warrener full many a Wile Devises to entrap his greedy Foe, Fat with nocturnal Spoils. At Close of Day, With Silence drags his Trail; then from the Ground Pares thin the close-graz'd Turf, there with nice Hand Covers the latent Death, with curious Springs Prepar'd to fly at once, whene'er the Tread Of Man or Beast, unwarily shall press The yielding Surface. By th' indented Steel With Gripe tenacious held, the Felon grins, And struggles, but in vain: Yet oft 'tis known, When ev'ry Art has fail'd, the captive Fox Has shar'd the wounded Joint, and with a Limb Compounded for his Life. But if perchance In the deep Pitfall plung'd, there's no Escape; But unrepriev'd he dies, and bleach'd in Air, The Jest of Clowns, his reaking Carcase hangs. Of these are various Kinds; not ev'n the King Of Brutes evades this deep devouring Grave: But by the wily African betray'd, Heedless of Fate, within its gaping Jaws Expires indignant. When the orient Beam With Blushes paints the Dawn; and all the Race Carnivorous, with Blood full-gorg'd, retire Into their darksome Cells, there satiate snore O'er dripping Offals, and the mangled Limbs Of Men and Beasts; the painful Forrester Climbs the high Hills, whose proud aspiring Tops, With the tall Cedar crown'd, and taper Fir, Assail the Clouds. There 'mong the craggy Rocks, And Thickets intricate, trembling he views His Footsteps in the Sand; the dismal Road And Avenue to Death. Hither he calls His watchful Bands; and low into the Ground A Pit they sink, full many a Fathom deep. Then in the midst a Column high is rear'd, The Butt of some fair Tree; upon whose Top A Lamb is plac'd, just ravish'd from his Dam. And next a Wall they build, with Stones and Earth Encircling round, and hiding from all View The dreadful Precipice. Now when the Shades Of Night hang low'ring o'er the Mountain's Brow; And Hunger keen, and pungent Thirst of Blood, Rouse up the slothful Beast, he shakes his Sides, Slow-rising from his Lair, and stretches wide His rav'nous Paws with recent Gore distain'd. The Forests tremble, as he roars aloud, Impatient to destroy. O'erjoy'd he hears The bleating Innocent, that claims in vain The Shepherd's Care, and seeks with piteous Moan The foodful Teat; himself, alas! design'd Another's Meal. For now the greedy Brute Winds him from far; and leaping o'er the Mound To seize his trembling Prey, headlong is plung'd Into the deep Abyss. Prostrate he lies Astunn'd and impotent. Ah! what avail Thine Eye-balls flashing Fire, thy Length of Tail, That lashes thy broad Sides, thy Jaws besmear'd With Blood and Offals crude, thy shaggy Mane, The Terror of the Woods, thy stately Port, And Bulk enormous, since by Stratagem Thy Strength is foil'd? Unequal is the Strife, When sov'reign Reason combats brutal Rage. On distant Ethiopia's Sun-burnt Coasts The black Inhabitants a Pitfall frame, But of a diff'rent Kind, and diff'rent Use. With slender Poles the wide capacious Mouth, And Hurdles slight, they close; o'er these is spread A Floor of verdant Turf, with all its Flow'rs Smiling delusive, and from strictest Search Concealing the deep Grave, that yawns below. Then Boughs of Trees they cut, with tempting Fruit Of various Kinds surcharg'd; the downy Peach, The clust'ring Vine, and of bright golden Rind The fragrant Orange. Soon as Ev'ning grey Advances slow, besprinkling all around With kind refreshing Dews the thirsty Glebe, The stately Elephant from the close Shade With Step majestic strides, eager to taste The cooler Breeze, that from the Sea-beat Shore Delightful breathes, or in the limpid Stream To lave his panting Sides; joyous he scents The rich Repast, unweeting of the Death That lurks within. And soon he sporting breaks The brittle Boughs, and greedily devours The Fruit delicious. Ah! too dearly bought; The Price is Life. For now the treach'rous Turf Trembling gives way; and the unwieldy Beast Self-sinking, drops into the dark Profound. So when dilated Vapours struggling heave Th'incumbent Earth; if chance the cavern'd Ground Shrinking subside, and the thin Surface yield, Down sinks at once the pond'rous Dome, ingulph'd With all its Tow'rs. Subtle, delusive Man! How various are thy Wiles! artful to kill Thy savage Foes, a dull unthinking Race! Fierce from his Lair springs forth the speckled Pard, Thirsting for Blood, and eager to destroy; The Huntsman flies, but to his Flight alone Confides not: At convenient Distance fix'd A polish'd Mirrour stops in full Career The furious Brute: He there his Image views; Spots against Spots with Rage improving glow; Another Pard his bristly Whiskers curls, Grins as he grins, fierce-menacing, and wide Distends his op'ning Paws; himself against Himself oppos'd, and with dread Vengeance arm'd. The Huntsman now secure, with fatal Aim Directs the pointed Spear, by which transfix'd He dies, and with him dies the rival Shade. Thus Man innum'rous Engines forms, t'assail The savage Kind: But most the docile Horse, Swift and confederate with Man, annoys His Brethren of the Plains; without whose Aid The Hunter's Arts are vain, unskill'd to wage With the more active Brutes an equal War. But, borne by him, without the well-train'd Pack, Man dares his Foe, on Wings of Wind secure. Him the fierce Arab mounts, and with his Troop Of bold Compeers, ranges the Deserts wild; Where, by the Magnet's Aid, the Traveller Steers his untrodden Course; yet oft on Land Is wreck'd, in the high-rolling Waves of Sand Immerst and lost. While these intrepid Bands, Safe in their Horses Speed, out-fly the Storm, And, scowring round, make Men and Beasts their Prey. The grisly Boar is singled from his Herd As large as that in Erimanthian Woods, A Match for Hercules. Round him they fly In Circles wide; and each in passing sends His feather'd Death into his brawny Sides. But perilous th' Attempt. For if the Steed Haply too near approach; or the loose Earth His Footing fail; the watchful angry Beast Th' Advantage spies; and at one sidelong Glance Rips up his Groin. Wounded, he rears aloft, And plunging from his Back the Rider hurls Precipitant; then bleeding spurns the Ground, And drags his reeking Entrails o'er the Plain. Mean while the surly Monster trots along, But with unequal Speed; for still they wound, Swift-wheeling in the spacious Ring. A Wood Of Darts upon his Back he bears; adown His tortur'd Sides the crimson Torrents roll From many a gaping Font. And now, at last, Stagg'ring he falls, in Blood and Foam expires. But whither roves my devious Muse, intent On antique Tales? While yet the Royal Stag Unsung remains. Tread with respectful Awe Windsor's green Glades; where Denham, tuneful Bard, Charm'd once the list'ning Dryads with his Song Sublimely sweet. O! grant me, sacred Shade, To glean submiss what thy full Sickle leaves. The Morning Sun, that gilds with trembling Rays Windsor's high Tow'rs, beholds the courtly Train Mount for the Chace, nor views in all his Course A Scene so gay: Heroic, noble Youths, In Arts and Arms renown'd, and lovely Nymphs, The fairest of this Isle, where Beauty dwells Delighted, and deserts her Paphian Grove For our more favour'd Shades: In proud Parade These shine magnificent, and press around The Royal happy Pair. Great in themselves, They smile superior; of external Show Regardless, while their inbred Virtues give A Lustre to their Pow'r, and grace their Court With real Splendors, far above the Pomp Of Eastern Kings, in all their Tinsel Pride. Like Troops of Amazons, the female Band Prance round their Cars, not in refulgent Arms As those of old; unskill'd to wield the Sword, Or bend the Bow, these kill with surer Aim. The Royal Offspring, fairest of the Fair, Lead on the splendid Train. Anna, more bright Than Summer Suns, or as the Light'ning keen With irresistible Effulgence arm'd, Fires ev'ry Heart. He must be more than Man, Who, unconcern'd, can bear the piercing Ray. Amelia, milder than the blushing Dawn, With sweet engaging Air but equal Pow'r, Insensibly subdues, and in soft Chains Her willing Captives leads. Illustrious Maids, Ever triumphant! whose victorious Charms, Without the needless Aid of high Descent, Had aw'd Mankind, and taught the World's great Lords To bow and sue for Grace. But who is he, Fresh as a Rose-bud newly blown, and fair As op'ning Lilies; on whom ev'ry Eye With Joy and Admiration dwells? See, see, He reins his docile Barb with manly Grace. Is it Adonis for the Chace array'd? Or Britain's second Hope? Hail, blooming Youth! May all your Virtues with your Years improve, 'Till in consummate Worth you shine the Pride Of these our Days, and to succeeding Times A bright Example. As his Guard of Mutes On the great Sultan wait, with Eyes deject And fix'd on Earth, no Voice, no Sound is heard Within the wide Serail, but all is hush'd, And awful Silence reigns; thus stand the Pack Mute and unmov'd, and cow'ring low to Earth, While pass the glitt'ring Court and Royal Pair: So disciplin'd those Hounds, and so reserv'd, Whose Honour 'tis to glad the Hearts of Kings. But soon the winding Horn, and Huntsman's Voice, Let loose the gen'ral Chorus; far around Joy spreads its Wings, and the gay Morning smiles. Unharbour'd now the Royal Stag forsakes His wonted Lair; he shakes his dappled Sides, And tosses high his beamy Head, the Copse Beneath his Antlers bends. What doubling Shifts He tries! not more the wily Hare; in these Wou'd still persist, did not the full-mouth'd Pack With dreadful Consort thunder in his Rear. The Woods reply, the Hunter's chearing Shouts Float thro' the Glades, and the wide Forest rings. How merrily they chant! their Nostrils deep Inhale the grateful Steam. Such is the Cry, And such th' harmonious Din, the Soldier deems The Battle kindling, and the Statesman grave Forgets his weighty Cares; each Age, each Sex, In the wild Transport joins; luxuriant Joy, And Pleasure in Excess, sparkling exult On ev'ry Brow, and revel unrestrain'd. How happy art thou, Man, when thou'rt no more Thy self! when all the Pangs that grind thy Soul, In Rapture and in sweet Oblivion lost, Yield a short Interval, and Ease from Pain! See the swift Courser strains, his shining Hoofs Securely beat the solid Ground. Who now The dang'rous Pitfall fears, with tangling Heath High-overgrown? Or who the quiv'ring Bog Soft-yielding to the Step? All now is plain, Plain as the Strand Sea-lav'd, that stretches far Beneath the rocky Shore. Glades crossing Glades The Forest opens to our wond'ring View: Such was the King's Command. Let Tyrants fierce Lay waste the World; his the more glorious Part To check their Pride; and when the brazen Voice Of War is hush'd (as erst victorious Rome) T' employ his station'd Legions in the Works Of Peace; to smooth the rugged Wilderness, To drain the stagnate Fen, to raise the slope Depending Road, and to make gay the Face Of Nature with th' Embellishments of Art. How melts my beating Heart! as I behold Each lovely Nymph, our Island's Boast and Pride, Push on the gen'rous Steed, that strokes along O'er rough, o'er smooth, nor heeds the steepy Hill, Nor faulters in th' extended Vale below; Their Garments loosely waving in the Wind, And all the Flush of Beauty in their Cheeks! While at their Sides their pensive Lovers wait, Direct their dubious Course; now chill'd with Fear Solicitous, and now with Love inflam'd. O! grant, indulgent Heav'n, no rising Storm May darken with black Wings this glorious Scene! Shou'd some malignant Pow'r thus damp our Joys, Vain were the gloomy Cave, such as of old Betray'd to lawless Love the Tyrian Queen. For Britain's virtuous Nymphs are chaste as fair, Spotless, unblam'd, with equal Triumph reign In the Dun Gloom as in the Blaze of Day. Now the blown Stag, thro' Woods, Bogs, Roads, and Streams Has measur'd half the Forest; but alas! He flies in vain, he flies not from his Fears. Tho' far he cast the ling'ring Pack behind, His haggard Fancy still with Horrors views The fell Destroyer; still the fatal Cry Insults his Ears, and wounds his trembling Heart. So the poor Fury-haunted Wretch (his Hands In guiltless Blood distain'd) still seems to hear The dying Shrieks; and the pale threat'ning Ghost Moves as he moves, and, as he flies, pursues. See here his Slot; up yon green Hill he climbs, Pants on its Brow a while, sadly looks back On his Pursuers cov'ring all the Plain; But, wrung with Anguish, bears not long the Sight, Shoots down the Steep, and sweats along the Vale: There mingles with the Herd, where once he reign'd Proud Monarch of the Groves, whose clashing Beam His Rivals aw'd, and whose exalted Pow'r Was still rewarded with successful Love. But the base Herd have learn'd the Ways of Men, Averse they fly, or with rebellious Aim Chase him from thence: needless their impious Deed, The Huntsman knows him by a thousand Marks, Black, and imbost; nor are his Hounds deceiv'd; Too well distinguish'd these, and never leave Their once devoted Foe; familiar grows His Scent, and strong their Appetite to kill. Again he flies, and with redoubled Speed Skims o'er the Lawn; still the tenacious Crew Hang on the Track, aloud demand their Prey, And push him many a League. If haply then Too far escap'd, and the gay courtly Train Behind are cast, the Huntsman's clanging Whip Stops full their bold Career; passive they stand, Unmov'd, an humble, an obsequious Crowd, As if by stern Medusa gaz'd to Stones. So at their Gen'ral's Voice whole Armies halt In full Pursuit, and check their Thirst of Blood. Soon, at the King's Command, like hasty Streams Damm'd up a while, they foam, and pour along With fresh recruited Might. The Stag, who hop'd His Foes were lost, now once more hears astunn'd The dreadful Din; he shivers ev'ry Limb, He starts, he bounds; each Bush presents a Foe. Press'd by the fresh Relay, no Pause allow'd, Breathless and faint, he faulters in his Pace, And lifts his weary Limbs with Pain, that scarce Sustain their Load; he pants, he sobs apall'd; Drops down his heavy Head to Earth, beneath His cumb'rous Beams oppress'd. But if perchance Some prying Eye surprize him; soon he rears Erect his tow'ring Front, bounds o'er the Lawn With ill-dissembled Vigour, to amuse The knowing Forester; who inly smiles At his weak Shifts and unavailing Frauds. So midnight Tapers waste their last Remains, Shine forth a while, and as they blaze expire. From Wood to Wood redoubling Thunders roll, And bellow thro' the Vales; the moving Storm Thickens amain, and loud triumphant Shouts, And Horns shrill-warbling in each Glade, prelude To his approaching Fate. And now in view With hobbling Gait, and high, exerts amaz'd What Strength is left: To the last Dregs of Life Reduc'd, his Spirits sail, on ev'ry Side Hemm'd in, besieg'd; not the least Op'ning left To gleaming Hope, th' Unhappy's last Reserve. Where shall he turn? Or whither fly? Despair Gives Courage to the Weak. Resolv'd to die, He fears no more, but rushes on his Foes, And deals his Deaths around; beneath his Feet These grov'ling lie, those by his Antlers gor'd Defile th'ensanguin'd Plain. Ah! see distress'd He stands at Bay against yon knotty Trunk, That covers well his Rear, his Front presents An Host of Foes. O! shun, ye noble Train, The rude Encounter, and believe your Lives Your Country's Due alone. As now aloof They wing around, he finds his Soul uprais'd, To dare some great Exploit; he charges home Upon the broken Pack, that on each Side Fly diverse; then as o'er the Turf he strains, He vents the cooling Stream, and up the Breeze Urges his Course with eager Violence: Then takes the Soil, and plunges in the Flood Precipitant; down the Mid-stream he wafts Along, 'till (like a Ship distress'd, that runs Into some winding Creek) close to the Verge Of a small Island, for his weary Feet Sure Anchorage he finds, there skulks immers'd. His Nose, alone above the Wave, draws in The vital Air; all else beneath the Flood Conceal'd, and lost, deceives each prying Eye Of Man or Brute. In vain the crowding Pack Draw on the Margin of the Stream, or cut The liquid Wave with oary Feet, that move In equal Time. The gliding Waters leave No Trace behind, and his contracted Pores But sparingly perspire: The Huntsman strains His lab'ring Lungs, and puffs his Cheeks in vain: At length a Blood-hound bold, studious to kill, And exquisite of Sense, winds him from far; Headlong he leaps into the Flood, his Mouth Loud op'ning spends amain, and his wide Throat Swells ev'ry Note with Joy; then fearless dives Beneath the Wave, hangs on his Haunch, and wounds Th' unhappy Brute, that flounders in the Stream, Sorely distress'd, and struggling strives to mount The steepy Shore. Haply once more escap'd; Again he stands at Bay, amid the Groves Of Willows, bending low their downy Heads. Outragious Transport fires the greedy Pack; These swim the Deep, and those crawl up with Pain The slipp'ry Bank, while others on firm Land Engage; the Stag repels each bold Assault, Maintains his Post, and Wounds for Wounds returns. As when some wily Corsair boards a Ship Full freighted or from Afric's golden Coasts, Or India's wealthy Strand, his bloody Crew Upon her Deck he slings; these in the Deep Drop short, and swim to reach her steepy Sides, And clinging climb aloft; while those on Board Urge on the Work of Fate; the Master bold, Press'd to his last Retreat, bravely resolves To sink his Wealth beneath the whelming Wave, His Wealth, his Foes, nor unreveng'd to die. So fares it with the Stag: So he resolves To plunge at once into the Flood below, Himself, his Foes in one deep Gulph immers'd. E'er yet he executes this dire Intent, In wild Disorder once more views the Light; Beneath a Weight of Woe he groans distress'd: The Tears run trickling down his hairy Cheeks; He weeps, nor weeps in vain. The King beholds His wretched Plight, and Tenderness innate Moves his great Soul. Soon at his high Command Rebuk'd, the disappointed, hungry Pack Retire submiss, and grumbling quit their Prey. Great Prince! from thee what may thy Subjects hope; So kind, and so beneficent to Brutes? O Mercy, heav'nly born! Sweet Attribute! Thou great, thou best Prerogative of Pow'r! Justice may guard the Throne, but join'd with thee, On Rocks of Adamant it stands secure, And braves the Storm beneath; soon as thy Smiles Gild the rough Deep, the foaming Waves subside, And all the noisy Tumult sinks in Peace. BOOK the Fourth The Argument of the Fourth Book. Of the Necessity of destroying some Beasts, and preserving others for the Use of Man. Of breeding of Hounds; the Season for this Business. The Choice of the Dog, of great Moment. Of the Litter of Whelps. Of the Number to be rear'd. Of setting them out to their several Walks. Care to be taken to prevent their Hunting too soon. Of entering the Whelps. Of breaking them from running at Sheep. Of the Diseases of Hounds. Of their Age. Of Madness; two Sorts of it described, the dumb, and outragious Madness: It's dreadful Effects. Burning of the Wound recommended as preventing all ill Consequences. The infectious Hounds to be separated, and fed apart. The Vanity of trusting to the many infallible Cures for this Malady. The dismal Effects of the Biting of a mad Dog, upon Man, described. Description of the Otter-Hunting. The Conclusion. Whate'er of Earth is form'd, to Earth returns Dissolv'd: the various Objects we behold, Plants, Animals, this whole material Mass, Are ever changing, ever new. The Soul Of Man alone, that Particle divine, Escapes the Wreck of Worlds, when all Things fail. Hence great the Distance 'twixt the Beasts that perish, And God's bright Image, Man's immortal Race. The Brute Creation are his Property, Subservient to his Will, and for him made. As hurtful these he kills, as useful those Preserves; their sole and arbitrary King. Shou'd he not kill, as erst the Samian Sage Taught unadvis'd, and Indian Brachmans now As vainly preach; the teeming rav'nous Brutes Might fill the scanty Space of this Terrene, Incumb'ring all the Globe: Shou'd not his Care Improve his growing Stock, their Kinds might fail, Man might once more on Roots and Acorns feed, And thro' the Deserts range, shiv'ring, forlorn, Quite destitute of ev'ry Solace dear, And ev'ry smiling Gayety of Life. The prudent Huntsman therefore will supply, With annual large Recruits, his broken Pack, And propagate their Kind. As from the Root Fresh Scions still spring forth, and daily yield New-blooming Honours to the Parent-Tree: Far shall his Pack be fam'd, far sought his Breed, And Princes at their Tables feast those Hounds His Hand presents, an acceptable Boon. E'er yet the Sun thro' the bright Ram has urg'd His steepy Course, or Mother Earth unbound Her frozen Bosom to the Western Gale; When feather'd Troops, their social Leagues dissolv'd, Select their Mates, and on the leafless Elm The noisy Rook builds high her wicker Nest; Mark well the wanton Females of thy Pack, That curl their taper Tails, and frisking court Their pyebald Mates enamour'd; their red Eyes Flash Fires impure; nor Rest, nor Food they take, Goaded by furious Love. In sep'rate Cells Confine them now, lest bloody Civil Wars Annoy thy peaceful State. If left at large, The growling Rivals in dread Battle join, And rude Encounter. On Scamander's Streams Heroes of old with far less Fury fought For the bright Spartan Dame, their Valour's Prize. Mangled and torn thy fav'rite Hounds shall lie, Stretch'd on the Ground; thy Kennel shall appear A Field of Blood: like some unhappy Town In Civil Broils confus'd, while Discord shakes Her bloody Scourge aloft, fierce Parties rage, Staining their impious Hands in mutual Death. And still the best belov'd and bravest fall: Such are the dire Effects of lawless Love. Huntsman! these Ills by timely prudent Care Prevent: for ev'ry longing Dame select Some happy Paramour; to him alone In Leagues connubial join. Consider well His Lineage; what his Fathers did of old, Chiefs of the Pack, and first to climb the Rock, Or plunge into the Deep, or thread the Brake With Thorns sharp-pointed, plash'd, and Bri'rs inwoven. Observe with Care his Shape, Sort, Colour, Size. Nor will sagacious Huntsmen less regard His inward Habits; the vain Babbler shun, Ever loquacious, ever in the wrong. His foolish Offspring shall offend thy Ears With false Alarms, and loud Impertinence. Nor less the shifting Cur avoid, that breaks Illusive from the Pack; to the next Hedge Devious he strays, there ev'ry Mews he tries; If haply then he cross the streaming Scent, Away he flies vain-glorious; and exults As of the Pack supreme, and in his Speed And Strength unrivall'd. Lo! cast far behind, His vex'd Associates pant, and lab'ring strain To climb the steep Ascent. Soon as they reach Th'insulting Boaster, his false Courage fails, Behind he lags, doom'd to the fatal Noose, His Master's Hate, and Scorn of all the Field. What can from such be hop'd, but a base Brood Of Coward Curs, a frantick, vagrant Race? When now the third revolving Moon appears With sharpen'd Horns above th' Horizon's Brink, Without Lucina's Aid, expect thy Hopes Are amply crown'd; short Pangs produce to Light The smoking Litter, crawling, helpless, blind, Nature their Guide, they seek the pouting Teat That plenteous streams. Soon as the tender Dam Has form'd them with her Tongue, with Pleasure view The Marks of their renown'd Progenitors, Sure Pledge of Triumphs yet to come. All these Select with Joy; but to the merc'less Flood Expose the dwindling Refuse, nor o'erload Th'indulgent Mother. If thy Heart relent, Unwilling to destroy, a Nurse provide, And to the Foster-parent give the Care Of thy superfluous Brood; she'll cherish kind The Alien Offspring; pleas'd thou shalt behold Her Tenderness and hospitable Love. If frolick now, and play-full, they desert Their gloomy Cell, and on the verdant Turf With Nerves improv'd, pursue the mimick Chace, Coursing around; unto thy choicest Friends Commit thy valu'd Prize: The rustick Dames Shall at thy Kennel wait, and in their Laps Receive thy growing Hopes, with many a Kiss Caress, and dignify their little Charge With some great Title, and resounding Name Of high Import. But cautious here observe To check their youthful Ardour, nor permit The unexperienc'd Younker, immature, Alone to range the Woods, or haunt the Brakes Where dodging Conies sport: His Nerves unstrung, And Strength unequal; the laborious Chace Shall stint his Growth, and his rash forward Youth Contract such vicious Habits, as thy Care And late Correction never shall reclaim. When to full Strength arriv'd, mature and bold, Conduct them to the Field; not all at once, But, as thy cooler Prudence shall direct, Select a few, and form them by Degrees To stricter Discipline. With these consort The stanch and steddy Sages of thy Pack, By long Experince vers'd in all the Wiles And subtle Doublings of the various Chace. Easy the Lesson of the youthful Train, When Instinct prompts, and when Example guides. If the too forward Younker at the Head Press boldly on, in wanton sportive Mood, Correct his Haste, and let him feel abash'd The ruling Whip. But if he stoop behind In wary modest Guise, to his own Nose Confiding sure; give him full Scope to work His winding Way, and with thy Voice applaud His Patience and his Care; soon shalt thou view The hopeful Pupil Leader of his Tribe, And all the list'ning Pack attend his Call. Oft lead them forth where wanton Lambkins play, And bleating Dams with jealous Eyes observe Their tender Care. If at the crowding Flock He bay presumptuous, or with eager Haste Pursue them scatter'd o'er the verdant Plain; In the foul Fact attach'd, to the strong Ram Tie fast the rash Offender. See! at first His horn'd Companion, fearful, and amaz'd, Shall drag him trembling o'er the rugged Ground: Then with his Load fatigu'd, shall turn a Head, And with his curl'd hard Front incessant peal The panting Wretch; 'till breathless and astunn'd, Stretch'd on the Turf he lie. Then spare not thou The twining Whip, but ply his bleeding Sides Lash after Lash, and with thy threat'ning Voice, Harsh-echoing from the Hills, inculcate loud His vile Offence. Sooner shall trembling Doves Escap'd the Hawk's sharp Talons, in mid Air, Assail their dang'rous Foe, than he once more Disturb the peaceful Flocks. In tender Age Thus Youth is train'd; as curious Artists bend The taper, pliant Twig; or Potters form Their soft and ductile Clay to various Shapes. Nor is't enough to breed; but to preserve Must be the Huntsman's Care. The stanch old Hounds, Guides of thy Pack, tho' but in Number few, Are yet of great Account; shall oft untie The Gordian Knot, when Reason at a stand Puzzling is lost, and all thy Art is vain. O'er clogging Fallows, o'er dry plaster'd Roads, O'er floated Meads, o'er Plains with Flocks distain'd Rank-scenting, these must lead the dubious Way. As Party-Chiefs in Senates who preside, With pleaded Reason and with well-turn'd Speech Conduct the staring Multitude; so these Direct the Pack, who with joint Cry approve, And loudly boast Discov'ries not their own. Unnumber'd Accidents, and various Ills Attend thy Pack, hang hov'ring o'er their Heads, And point the Way that leads to Death's dark Cave. Short is their Span; few at the Date arrive Of ancient Argus in old Homer's Song So highly honour'd: Kind, sagacious Brute! Not ev'n Minerva's Wisdom could conceal Thy much lov'd Master from thy nicer Sense. Dying his Lord he own'd, view'd him all o'er With eager Eyes, then clos'd those Eyes well pleas'd. Of lesser Ills the Muse declines to sing, Nor stoops so low; of these each Groom can tell The proper Remedy. But O! what Care! What Prudence can prevent Madness, the worst Of Maladies? Terrifick Pest! that blasts The Huntsman's Hopes, and Desolation spreads Thro' all th' unpeopled Kennel unrestrain'd. More fatal than th' envenom'd Viper's Bite; Or that Apulian Spider's pois'nous Sting, Heal'd by the pleasing Antidote of Sounds. When Sirius reigns, and the Sun's parching Beams Bake the dry gaping Surface, visit thou, Each Ev'n and Morn, with quick observant Eye, Thy panting Pack. If, in dark sullen Mood, The glouting Hound refuse his wonted Meal, Retiring to some close, obscure Retreat, Gloomy, disconsolate: With Speed remove The poor infectious Wretch, and in strong Chains Bind him suspected. Thus that dire Disease, Which Art can't cure, wise Caution may prevent. But this neglected, soon expect a Change, A dismal Change, Confusion, Frenzy, Death. Or in some dark Recess the senseless Brute Sits sadly pining: Deep Melancholy, And black Despair, upon his clouded Brow Hang low'ring; from his half-op'ning Jaws The clammy Venom, and infectious Froth, Distilling fall; and from his Lungs inflam'd, Malignant Vapours taint the ambient Air, Breathing Perdition: His dim Eyes are glaz'd, He droops his pensive Head, his trembling Limbs No more support his Weight; abject he lies, Dumb, spiritless, benumb'd; 'till Death at last Gracious attends, and kindly brings Relief. Or if outragious grown, behold, alas! A yet more dreadful Scene; his glaring Eyes Redden with Fury, like some angry Boar Churning he foams; and on his Back erect His pointed Bristles rise; his Tail incorv'd He drops, and with harsh broken Howlings rends The poison-tainted Air, with rough, hoarse Voice Incessant bays, and snuffs th' infectious Breeze; This Way and that he stares aghast, and starts At his own Shade; jealous, as if he deem'd The World his Foes. If haply t'ward the Stream He cast his roving Eye, cold Horror chills His Soul; averse he flies, trembling, appall'd. Now frantick to the Kennel's utmost Verge Raving he runs, and deals Destruction round. The Pack fly diverse; for whate'er he meets Vengeful he bites, and ev'ry Bite is Death. If now perchance, thro' the weak Fence escap'd, Far up the Wind he roves, with open Mouth Inhales the cooling Breeze, nor Man, nor Beast He spares implacable. The Hunter-Horse, Once kind Associate of his sylvan Toils, (Who haply now without the Kennel's Mound Crops the rank Mead, and list'ning hears with Joy The chearing Cry, that Morn and Eve salutes His raptur'd Sense) a wretched Victim falls. Unhappy Quadruped! no more, alas! Shall thy fond Master with his Voice applaud Thy Gentleness, thy Speed; or with his Hand Stroke thy soft dapple Sides, as he each Day Visits thy Stall, well pleas'd; no more shalt thou With sprightly Neighings, to the winding Horn, And the loud op'ning Pack in Consort join'd, Glad his proud Heart. For oh! the secret Wound Rankling inflames, he bites the Ground and dies. Hence to the Village, with pernicious Haste, Baleful he bends his Course: The Village flies Alarm'd; the tender Mother in her Arms Hugs close the trembling Babe; the Doors are barr'd, And flying Curs, by native Instinct taught, Shun the contagious Bane; the rustick Bands Hurry to Arms, the rude Militia seize Whate'er at hand they find; Clubs, Forks, or Guns From ev'ry Quarter charge the furious Foe, In wild Disorder, and uncouth Array: 'Till now with Wounds on Wounds oppress'd and gor'd At one short pois'nous Gasp he breathes his last. Hence to the Kennel, Muse, return, and view, With heavy Heart, that Hospital of Woe; Where Horror stalks at large, insatiate Death Sits growling o'er his Prey: Each Hour presents A diff'rent Scene of Ruin in Distress. How busy art thou, Fate! and how severe Thy pointed Wrath! the Dying and the Dead Promiscuous lie; o'er these the Living sight In one eternal Broil; not conscious why, Nor yet with whom. So Drunkards, in their Cups, Spare not their Friends, while senseless Squabble reigns. Huntsman! it much behoves thee to avoid The perilous Debate! Ah! rouse up all Thy Vigilance, and tread the treach'rous Ground With careful Step. Thy Fires unquench'd preserve, As erst the Vestal Flame; the pointed Steel In the hot Embers hide; and if, surpriz'd, Thou feel'st the deadly Bite, quick urge it home Into the recent Sore, and cauterize The Wound; spare not thy Flesh, nor dread th' Event: Vulcan can save, when Æsculapius fails. Here shou'd the knowing Muse recount the Means To stop this growing Plague. And here, alas! Each Hand presents a sov'reign Cure, and boasts Infallibility, but boasts in vain. On this depend; each to his sep'rate Seat Confine, in Fetters bound; give each his Mess Apart, his Range in open Air; and then, If deadly Symptoms to thy Grief appear; Devote the Wretch, and let him greatly fall, A gen'rons Victim for the publick Weal. Sing, philosophic Muse! the dire Effects Of this contagious Bite on hapless Man. The rustic Swains, by long Tradition taught Of Leeches old, as soon as they perceive The Bite impress'd, to the Sea-coasts repair. Plung'd in the briny Flood th' unhappy Youth Now journeys home secure; but soon shall wish The Seas as yet had cover'd him beneath The foaming Surge full many a Fathom deep. A Fate more dismal and superior Ills Hang o'er his Head devoted. When the Moon, Closing her monthly Round, returns again To glad the Night; or when full-orb'd she shines High in the Vault of Heav'n; the lurking Pest Begins the dire Assault. The pois'nous Foam, Thro' the deep Wound instil'd, with hostile Rage, And all its fiery Particles saline, Invades th' arterial Fluid; whose red Waves Tempestuous heave, and, their Cohesion broke, Fermenting boil; intestine War ensues, And Order to Confusion turns embroil'd. Now the distended Vessels scarce contain The wild Uproar, but press each weaker Part, Unable to resist: The tender Brain And Stomach suffer most; Convulsions shake His trembling Nerves, and wand'ring pungent Pains Pinch sore the sleepless Wretch; his flutt'ring Pulse Oft intermits; pensive and sad he mourns His cruel Fate, and to his weeping Friends Laments in vain; to hasty Anger prone, Resents each slight Offence, walks with quick Step, And wildly stares; at last with boundless Sway The Tyrant Frenzy reigns. For, as the Dog, Whose fatal Bite convey'd th' infectious Bane, Raving he foams, and howls, and barks, and bates. Like Agitations in his boiling Blood Present like Species to his troubled Mind; His Nature, and his Actions, all canine. So (as old Homer sung) th' Associates wild Of wand'ring Ithacus, by Girce's Charms To Swine transform'd, ran gruntling thro' the Groves. Dreadful Example to a wicked World! See there distress'd he lies! parch'd up with Thirst, But dares not drink. 'Till now, at last, his Soul Trembling escapes, her noisome Dungeon leaves, And to some purer Region wings away. One Labour yet remains, celestial Maid! Another Element demands thy Song. No more o'er craggy Steeps, thro' Coverts thick With pointed Thorn, and Briers intricate, Urge on with Horn and Voice the painful Pack: But skim with wanton Wing th' irriguous Vale, Where winding Streams amid the flow'ry Mead Perpetual glide along; and undermine The cavern'd Banks, by the tenacious Roots Of hoary Willows arch'd; gloomy Retreat Of the bright scaly Kind; where they at Will On the green wat'ry Reed their Pasture graze, Suck the moist Soil, or slumber at their Ease, Rock'd by the restless Brook, that draws aslope Its humid Train, and laves their dark Abodes. Where rages not Oppression? Where, alas! Is Innocence secure? Rapine and Spoil Haunt ev'n the lowest Deeps; Seas have their Sharks; Rivers and Ponds inclos'd, the rav'nous Pike; He in his Turn becomes a Prey; on him Th' amphibious Otter feasts. Just is his Fate Deserv'd: But Tyrants know no Bounds; nor Spears, That bristle on his Back, defend the Perch From his wide greedy Jaws; nor burnish'd Mail The yellow Carp; nor all his Arts can save Th' insinuating Eel, that hides his Head Beneath the slimy Mud; nor yet escapes The crimson-spotted Trout, the River's Pride, And Beauty of the Stream. Without Remorse, This midnight Pillager, ranging around, Insatiate swallows all. The Owner mourns Th' unpeopled Rivulet, and gladly hears The Huntsman's early Call, and sees with Joy The jovial Crew, that march upon its Banks In gay Parade, with bearded Lances arm'd. This subtle Spoiler of the Beaver Kind, Far off, perhaps, where ancient Alders shade The deep still Pool, within some hollow Trunk Contrives his wicker Couch: Whence he surveys His long Purlieu, Lord of the Stream, and all The finny Shoals his own. But you, brave Youths, Dispute the Felon's Claim; try ev'ry Root, And ev'ry reedy Bank; encourage all The busy-spreading Pack, that fearless plunge Into the Flood, and cross the rapid Stream. Bid Rocks, and Caves, and each resounding Shore, Proclaim your bold Defiance, loudly raise Each chearing Voice, 'till distant Hills repeat The Triumphs of the Vale. On the soft Sand See there his Seal impress'd! and on that Bank Behold the glitt'ring Spoils, half-eaten Fish, Scales, Fins, and Bones, the Leavings of his Feast. Ah! on that yielding Sag-bed, see, once more His Seal I view. O'er yon dank rushy Marsh The fly Goose-footed Proler bends his Course, And seeks the distant Shallows. Huntsman, bring Thy eager Pack; and trail him to his Couch. Hark! the loud Peal begins, the clam'rous Joy, The gallant Chiding, loads the trembling Air. Ye Naiads fair, who o'er these Floods preside, Raise up your dripping Heads above the Wave, And hear our Melody. Th' harmonious Notes Float with the Stream; and ev'ry winding Creek And hollow Rock, that o'er the dimpling Flood Nods pendant; still improve, from Shore to Shore, Our sweet reiterated Joys. What Shouts! What Clamour loud! What gay heart-chearing Sounds Urge thro' the breathing Brass their mazy Way! Not Choirs of Tritons glad with sprightlier Strains The dancing Billows; when proud Neptune rides In Triumph o'er the Deep. How greedily They snuff the fishy Steam, that to each Blade Rank-scenting clings! See! how the Morning Dews They sweep, that from their Feet besprinkling drop Dispers'd, and leave a Track oblique behind, Now on firm Land they range; then in the Flood They plunge tumultuous; or thro' reedy Pools Rustling they work their Way: no Holt escapes Their curious Search. With quick Sensation now The fuming Vapour stings; flutter their Hearts, And Joy redoubled bursts from ev'ry Mouth, In louder Symphonies. Yon hollow Trunk, That with its hoary Head incurv'd salutes The passing Wave, must be the Tyrant's Fort And dread Abode. How these impatient climb, While others at the Root incessant bay: They put him down. See, there he dives along! Th' ascending Bubbles mark his gloomy Way. Quick fix the Nets, and cut off his Retreat Into the shelt'ring Deeps. Ah, there he vents! The Pack plunge headlong, and protended Spears Menace Destruction. While the troubled Surge Indignant foams, and all the scaly Kind Affrighted, hide their Heads. Wild Tumult reigns, And loud Uproar. Ah, there once more he vents! See, that bold Hound has seiz'd him; down they sink, Together lost: But soon shall he repent: His rash Assault. See, there escap'd, he flies Half drown'd, and clambers up the slipp'ry Bank With Ouze and Blood distain'd. Of all the Brutes, Whether by Nature form'd, or by long Use, This artful Diver best can bear the Want Of vital Air. Unequal is the Fight Beneath the whelming Element. Yet there He lives not long; but Respiration needs At proper Intervals. Again he vents; Again the Crowd attack. That Spear has pierc'd His Neck; the crimson Waves confess the Wound. Fix'd is the bearded Lance, unwelcome Guest; Where-e'er he flies; with him it sinks beneath, With him it mounts; sure Guide to ev'ry Foe. Inly he groans, nor can his tender Wound Bear the cold Stream. Lo! to yon sedgy Bank He creeps disconsolate; his num'rous Foes Surround him, Hounds and Men. Pierc'd thro' and thro', On pointed Spears they lift him high in Air; Wriggling he hangs, and grins, and bites in vain: Bid the loud Horns, in gayly-warbling Strains, Proclaim the Felon's Fate; he dies, he dies. Rejoice, ye scaly Tribes, and leaping dance Above the Wave, in Sign of Liberty Restor'd; the cruel Tyrant is no more. Rejoice secure and bless'd, did not as yet Remain some of your own rapacious Kind, And Man, fierce Man, with all his various Wiles. O happy! if ye knew your happy State, Ye Rangers of the Fields; whom Nature boon Chears with her Smiles, and ev'ry Element Conspires to bless. What if no Heroes frown From marble Pedestals, nor Raphael's Works, Nor Titian's lively Tints, adorn our Walls? Yet these the meanest of us may behold, And, at another's Cost, may feast at Will Our wond'ring Eyes. What can the Owner more? But vain, alas! is Wealth, not grac'd with Pow'r. The flow'ry Landskip, and the gilded Dome, And Vista's op'ning to the weary'd Eye Thro' all his wide Domain; the planted Grove, The shrubby Wilderness, with its gay Choir Of warbling Birds, can't lull to soft Repose Th' ambitious Wretch, whose discontented Soul Is harrow'd Day and Night; he mourns, he pines, Until his Prince's Favour makes him great. See there he comes, th' exalted Idol comes! The Circle's form'd, and all his fawning Slaves Devoutly bow to Earth; from ev'ry Mouth The nauseous Flatt'ry flows, which he returns With Promises, that die as soon as born. Vile Intercourse! where Virtue has no Place. Frown but the Monarch, all his Glories fade; He mingles with the Throng, outcast, undone, The Pageant of a Day; without one Friend To sooth his tortur'd Mind; all, all are fled; For, tho' they bask'd in his meridian Ray, The Insects vanish as his Beams decline. Not such our Friends; for here no dark Design, No wicked Int'rest bribes the venal Heart; But Inclination to our Bosom leads, And weds them there for Life; our social Cups Smile as we smile; open and unreserv'd, We speak our inmost Souls; Good-humour, Mirth, Soft Complaisance, and Wit from Malice free, Smooth ev'ry Brow, and glow on ev'ry Cheek. O happiness sincere! what Wretch would groan Beneath the galling Load of Pow'r, or walk Upon the slipp'ry Pavements of the Great, Who thus cou'd reign unenvy'd and secure? Ye guardian Pow'rs, who make Mankind your Care, Give me to know wise Nature's hidden Depths, Trace each mysterious Cause, with Judgment read Th' expanded Volume, and submiss adore That great creative Will, who, at a Word Spoke forth the wond'rous Scene. But if my Soul, To this gross Clay confin'd, flutters on Earth With less ambitious Wing; unskill'd to range From Orb to Orb, where Newton leads the Way; And view with piercing Eye the grand Machine, Worlds above Worlds; subservient to his Voice, Who, veil'd in clouded Majesty, alone Gives Light to all; bids the great System move, And changeful Seasons in their Turns advance, Unmov'd, unchang'd himself. Yet this, at least, Grant me propitious, an inglorious Life, Calm and serene, nor lost in false Pursuits Of Wealth or Honours; but enough to raise My drooping Friends, preventing modest Want, That dares not ask. And if, to crown my Joys, Ye grant me Health, that, ruddy in my Cheeks, Blooms in my Life's Decline; Fields, Woods, and Streams, Each tow'ring Hill, each humble Vale below, Shall hear my chearing Voice, my Hounds shall wake The lazy Morn, and glad th' Horizon round.</field>
