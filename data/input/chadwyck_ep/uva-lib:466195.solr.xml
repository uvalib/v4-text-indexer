      <field name="fulltext">[As the flower early gathered, whilst fresh in its bloom] As the flower early gathered, whilst fresh in its bloom, So was she whom I mourn for sent young to the tomb; In the pains of her travail, the prime of her youth, Whilst the memory survives of her sweetness and truth. Why bursts from this breaking heart one human sigh, She but sleepsâwhilst her spirit is borne up on high; Her course upon earth was so fair and so even, That I know her pure soul has ascended to Heav'n. Ah! cease then poor orphans to mourn round her bier, 'Tis for youâ'tis for you that I shed the sad tear; I will toil for you, dear ones, though she is no more, And we must not lament that her sufferings are o'er. MY HEART'S FIT TO BREAK. My heart's fit to break, yet no tear fills my eye, As I gaze on the moon, and the clouds that flit by; The moon shines so fair, it reminds me of thee, But the clouds that obscure it are emblems of me. They will pass like the dreams of our pleasures and youth, They will pass like the promise of honor and truth, And bright thou shalt shine when these shadows are gone, All radiant, serene, unobscur'dâbut alone. WILLIAM LAMB'S RETURN FROM PARIS, ASKING ME MY WISH. You ask my wishâthe boon I crave, O grant itâleave me what I have: Leave me to rest upon my bed, With broken heart, and weary head. No stormy passions now arise, Nor tears relieve these suffering eyes; No ageâno love disturbs me now, To God's avenging power I bow. You've yielded to a wicked crew, Who ruin me, and laugh at you; Sweep out the gore, and while you can, Think for yourself, and be a man. THOU WOULDST NOT DO WHAT I HAVE DONE. If thou couldst know what 'tis to weep, To weep unpitied and alone, The live-long night, whilst others sleep, Silent and mournful watch to keep, Thou wouldst not do what I have done. If thou couldst know what 'tis to smile, To smile whilst scorn'd by every one, To hide by many an artful wile, A heart that knows more grief than guile, Thou wouldst not do what I have done. And, oh! if thou couldst think how drear, When friends are changed, and health is gone, The world would to thine eyes appear, If thou, like me, to none wert dear, Thou wouldst not do what I have done. WEEP FOR WHAT THOU'ST LOST, LOVE. Weep for what thou'st lost, loveâ Weep for what thou'st doneâ Weep for what thou did'st not do, And more for what thou'st done. Time that's gone returneth never, Keen repining lasteth ever; Heart that's pierc'd refuseth gladness, Melancholy causeth madness. Yet if tears avail not, Tears of fond regret; Arm thy mind, and proudly girl, Endeavour to forget. Shouldst thou spend thy days in grieving, What is past, there's no retrieving, Once the hour of passion over, Tear nor frown recalls a lover. SING NOT FOR OTHERS BUT FOR ME. Sing not for others but for me, In ev'ry thought, in ev'ry strain, Though I perchance am far from thee, And we may never meet again: Though I may only weep for thee, Sing not for others but for me. In starry night, or soft moon-beam, In mossy bank, or rippling stream, In balmy breeze or fragrant flower, Though dearer hands may deck the bower, In all that's sweet or fair to thee, Sing not for others but for me. If e'er thou sing'st thy native lay, As thou wert wont in happier day, That lay which breath'd of love and truth, And all the joys of early youth: Though all those joys are past for thee, Sing not for others, but for me. SIR HENRY DE VAUX. Sir Henry De Vaux came across the sea, To visit his native clime; A face like an angel of light had he, But his heart was sear'd by crime. He stood on his castle tow'r to gaze O'er the scenes which he long had left, And a thought came o'er him of happier days, Ere his heart was of hope bereft. The stream flow'd through that peaceful vale, The birds sang to a cloudless sky, And the calm around, and the soft fresh gale, But encreased his agony. A tear then fell from his dark proud eye, A tear of remorse and regret; âMy will is a law,â he cried, âthen why Cannot I learn to forget?â âI have fought when the desperate sight ran high, And the plain was dyed with blood; I have sail'd when danger and death were nigh,â But unmov'd, unappall'd, I stood. I have drank of pleasure the fatal draught, I have given to passion the rein; With the scoffer I've scoff'd, with the infidel laugh'd, And reason has warn'd me in vain. Oh, the pain that I feel hath such deadly force, That it strikes thro' my burning brain; 'Tis the pain of the soulâdespairâremorseâ There is none can endure such pain. 'Tis the voice of an angry God that cries, Till it harrows the mind within; 'Tis the worm of the heart that never dies, 'Tis the memory of sin.â THE KISS THAT'S ON THY LIP IMPRESSED. DUET. Gentleman. The kiss that's on thy lip impress'd, Was cold as parting kiss should be; And he who clasp'd thee to his breast, Again can never feel for thee: The chain he gaveâa true love token, Thou see'st in every link is broken. Both. Then since 'tis so, 'tis best to part, I here renounce the oaths I swore; Forget the past, amend thy heart, And let us meet no more. Lady. I goâyet e'er I go from thee, Give back what thou hast ta'en from me; A heart that knew no care nor guile, A mother's loveâa father's smile; The thoughts that dar'd aspire to heaven, Give these, and thou shalt be forgiven. Both. Take back the ringâtake back the chain, Thy giftsâthy loveâI here resign; Take back thy heart, since pledg'd in vain, But oh! restore what once was mine. AFTER MANY A WELL-FOUGHT DAY. After many a well-fought day, When with gen'rous ardour burning, Soldiers to their home returning, Chide the long and tardy way. Home advancing near and nearer, Wives and friends to greet them run; Dear before, but now far dearer, From the gallant deeds they've done. Some distracted wild with pleasure, Hands and hats and ribbons wave; Others sad, the long line measure, For the friends no prayer could save. Is he gone? they ask with sorrow, Is he lost? they ask with dread: Will he not return to-morrow? Is our gallant soldier dead? Yes! he's deadâbut fell with glory, Fell, his country's rights to save: Yes! he's deadâbut lives in story, Honour decks the soldier's grave. Then with hearts too nearly broken, To their lonely homes they turn, Pressing to their lips some token, From the friend for whom they mourn. AMIDST THE FLOWERS RICH AND GAY. Amidst the flowers rich and gay, That deck the fairy paths of pleasure, I mark'd one violet in my way, And seiz'd the little purple treasure. It seem'd to weep, the glitt'ring dew Fell from it as I press'd it nearer, And thought that nothing fair or new, Could ever to my heart be dearer. Alas! I left it like the rest, And left it when it lov'd me best. And now in youth and vigour gay, I wander forth each hour enchanted; Taste every joy that meets my way, Nor ask one boon that is not granted. Yet some times with an aching heart, I think of vows so fondly plighted, Of early love for ever blighted, And those who fell beneath its dart. In this cold selfish world, there's none Can love me now, as thou had'st done. TO WILLIAM LAMB. Yes, I adore thee, William Lamb, But hate to hear thee say God d?: Frenchmen, say English cry d? d? But why swear'st thou?âthou art a Lamb! WOULD I HAD SEEN THEE DEAD AND COLD. Would I had seen thee dead and cold, In thy lone grave asleep, Than live, thy falsehood to behold, And penitent to weep: For better, I thy grave could see, Than know that thou art false to me! Or rather, would that I had died, When happy on thy breastâ My love had then been satisfied, And life's last moments blest, For they taste bliss without alloy, Who die in the sweet dream of joy! But no! I feel the fault was mine, To think affection's chain Could thy proud wayward heart confine, When honor's claim was vain: Who robs the shrine where virtue lies, Will not the stolen relic prize! LET THE HARP BE MUTE FOR EVER. Let the harp be mute for ever, Rosa wakes no more the strain, All its strings asunder sever, Rosa will not sing again: Let those blooming chaplets perish, That crown'd it in its hour of joy, Nor ought remain the thought to cherish, Of her, that could my peace destroy. O! may no wand'ring breeze awaken, The echo of its slumb'ring strings, When by the zephyrs pinion shaken, It seems as if a spirit sings! Why should I feel a thrill of pleasure? Condemn'd from every hope to part: Why doat on melody's soft measure? With desolation in my heart. IF A DARK WRETCH E'ER STRAY'D. If a dark wretch e'er stray'd, Worse than the first fell slayer, 'Tis he that wooes a maid, To rifle and betray her! For wealth may be retriev'd, And friends long doom'd to sever, But the fond heart deceiv'd, Hath lost its peace for ever! [Little birds in yonder grove] Little birds in yonder grove, Making nests, and making love, Come sing upon your favorite tree, Once more your sweetest songs to me: An exile from these scenes I go, Whither, I neither care nor know: Perhaps to some far distant shore, Never again to hear you more. The river Lea glides smoothly by, Unconscious of my agony. This bursting sighâthis last sad tear, On quitting all I hold so dear, Are feltâare heardâare seen by none, Left as I am by every one. Farewell to Brocket's gladsome hall, Farewell to Dawson's fruitful wall, Farewell to Hassard's cheering smile, His hearty laugh, which cares no guile: Ever supported, 'till a sad tear, Dimm'd his bright eye for me this year. Farewell the faithful Welwyn band, The poorâthe kindâmy own dear land. Where'er I go, God bless you all; And thus I leave thee, Brocket Hall: Time was, a youthful happy child, Thoughtless, undauntedâwantonâgay, and wild, I came from home and parents dear, To find a home and husband here, My joyous days with youth are fled, My friends are either chang'd or dead: My faultsâmy folliesâleave these alone, They live in the mouth of every one, And still remain when all is gone. This is my twentieth marriage year, They celebrate with Hassard's beer; They danceâthey singâthey bless the day, I weep the whileâand well I may: Husband, nor child, to greet me come, Without a friendâwithout a home: I sit beneath my favorite tree, Sing then, my little birds, to me, In music, love, and liberty. LINES TO HARRIET WILSON. Harriet Wilson, shall I tell thee where, Beside my being cleverer, We differ?âthou wert hired to hold thy tongue, Thou hast no right to do thy lovers wrong: But I, whom none could buy or gain, Who am as proud, girl, as thyself art vain, And like thyself, or sooner like the wind, Blow raging ever free and unconfin'd. What should withhold my tongue with pen of steel, The faults of those who have wrong'd me to reveal? Why should I hide men's follies, whilst my own Blaze like the gas along this talking town? Is it being bitter to be too sincere? Must we adulterate truth as they do beer? I'll tell thee why then! as each has his price, I have been bought at lastâI am not ice: Kindness and gratitude have chained my tongue, From henceforth I will do no mortal wrong. Prate those who pleaseâlaughâcensure who that will, My mouth is sealedâmy thoughtsâmy penâare still. In the meantimeâwe Lambs are seldom civil, I wish thy bookânot theeâat the Devil.</field>
