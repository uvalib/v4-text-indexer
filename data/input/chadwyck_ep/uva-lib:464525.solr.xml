MS. 1701; Bodl. 415.] Here bygynneþ þe boke þat men clepyn yn frenshe Manuele pecche, þe whych boke made yn frenshe, Roberd Gros-test, Bysshop of Lyncolne. [THE PROLOG.] Fadyr, and Sone, &amp; holy goste, Þat art o god of my?tës moste, At þy wurschyp shul we bygynne, To shame þe fende &amp; shew oure synne; Synne to shewë, vs to frame, God to wurschyp, þe fende to shame. Shameful synne ys gode to lete, Al þat men do, boþe smale &amp; grete: Þe grete, withoutyn pryuyte, That ben commune to me &amp; the, Of hem wyl y telle ?ow nede As y haue herde &amp; red yn dede. Of þyse þan ys my sawe, þe commaundementys of the oldë lawe, Þysë ten were fyrst vs ?euyn, And fyrst we wylyn of hem be shreuyn, Yn what poyntys þat we falle Yn opon synne a?en hem alle. And syþen of þe seuene synnes, In what þyng þe fende vs wynnes; And syþen of synne of sacrylege, Þat ys to holy chyrche outrage; And of þe sacramentys seuene Þat techyn vs to þe blys of heuene; Syþyn of þe tweluë poyntes of shryfte, And of þe twelue gracys of here ?yfte; Al þat toucheþ dedly synne, In any spyce þat we falle ynne, þat ys oponly seen or wrou?t. Of pryuytes speke y ry?t nou?t; Þe pryuytes wyl y nat name For none þareforë shulde me blame; Leuer ys me þat þey he hydde, þan for me were oponly kydde. Noþeles þey mote be shreuyn ?yf ?yfte of gracë shal be ?euyn. Of þys clerkys wyl y nou?t seye; To greuë hem y haue grete eye, For þey wote þat ys to wetyn, And se hyt wel before hem wrytyn. Þat may be weyl on englyssh tolde, To telle ?ow þat, y may be bolde; For lewdë men y vndyr-toke On englyssh tunge to make þys boke. For many ben of swyche manere, Þat talys and rymys wyl bleþly here; Yn gamys, &amp; festys, &amp; at þe ale, Loue men to lestene trotëuale: Þat may falle ofte to vylanye, To dedly synne, or oþer folye; For swyche men haue y made þis ryme Þat þey may weyl dyspende here tyme, And þere-yn sumwhat for to here, To leue al swychë foul manere, And for to kunnë knowe þerynne Þat þey wene no synne be ynne. To alle crystyn men vndir sunne, And to godë men of Brunne, And specïali, alle be name, Þe felaushepe of Symprynghame, Roberd of Brunnë greteþ ?ow In al godenesse þat may to prow. Of Brunnëwakë yn Kesteuene, Syxe myle be-syde Sympryngham euene, Y dwelled yn þe pryorye Fyftenë ?ere yn cumpanye, In þe tyme of gode dane Ione Of Camelton, þat now ys gone: In hys tyme was y þere ten ?eres, And knewe and herd of hys maneres; Syþyn with dane Ione of Clyntone, Fyue wyntyr wyþ hym gan y wone; Dane Felyp was maystér þat tyme Þat y began þys englyssh ryme. Þe ?eres of grace fyl þan to be A þousynd &amp; þre hundred &amp; þre. In þat tymë turnede y þys On englyssh tunge out of frankys, Of a boke as y fonde ynne; Men clepyn þe bokë “handlyng synne.” In frenshë þer a clerk hyt sees, He clepyþ hyt “manuel de pecches.” ‘Manuel’ ys ‘handlyng with honde;’ ‘Pecches’ ys ‘synne,’ y vndyrstonde. Þese twey wurdys þat beyn otwynne, Do hem to gedyr, ys “handlyng synne.” And weyl ys clepyd, for þys skyle; And as y wote, ?ow shew y wyle. We handel synnë euery day; In wurde and dedë, al we may, Lytyl or mochel, synne we do, Þe fend and oure flesh tysyn vs þerto; ffór þys skyle hyt may be seyde ‘Handlyng synne’ for oure mysbreyde; ffór euery day &amp; euery oure We synne þat shal we bye ful soure. Anoþer handlyng þer shuld be, Wyþ shryfte of mouþe to clensë þe. Handyl þy synnë yn þy þou?t, Lytyl &amp; mochel, what þou hast wroght; Handyl þy synne to hauë drede; Noþyng but peyn ys þarfore mede. Handyl þy synnes, &amp; weyl hem gesse, How þey fordo al þy godenesse. Handyl þy synnes, &amp; weyl hem euene, Ellës forbarre þey þe blys of heuene. Handyl hem at onys euerychone, Noght onë by hym self alone. Handyl so to ryse from alle, Þat nonë makë þe eft falle, With shryfte of mouþe, &amp; wyl of herte, And a party, with penaunce smerte; Þys ys a skyl þat hyt may be tolde Handlyng synnë many a folde. Handlyng yn spechë ys as weyl As handlyng yn dedë euery deyl. On þys manere handyl þy dedys, And lestene and lerne whan any hem redys. Þou darst neuer recche where þou bygynne, For euery-whare ys bygynnyng of synne; whedyr þou wylt opon þe boke, Þou shalt fynde begynnyng oueral loke: Oueral ys bygynnyng, oueral ys ende; Hou þat þou wylt turne or wende, Many þyngys mayst þou þeryn here; With oft redyng, mayst þou lere; Þou mayst nat, with onys redyng, knowe þe soþe of euery þyng. Handyl, hyt behoueþ, oft syþys, To many maner synnes hyt wryþys. Talys shalt þou fynde þerynne, And chauncys þat haþ happed for synne; Meruelys, some as y fonde wrytyn, And oþer þat haue be seyn &amp; wetyn; None ben þare-yn, more ne lesse, But þat y founde wryte, or had wytnesse. Þarefore may hyt, &amp; gode skyl why, ‘Handlyng synne’ be clepyd oponly; For hyt toucheþ no priuite, But opyn synne þat called may be. Begynne we þan to telle yn hast, with fadyr and sone and holy gost, And yn wurschyp of oure lady, And al þe halewys þat beyn hem by: Þey ?eue vs grace ry?t so to deme, Vs to profyt, and god to queme. [The First Commandment.] The first commaundment ys of echone ‘Þou shalt haue no god but one,’ Né but o god shalt þou leue, Ne on no þyng þat wyl hym greue. Now beþenke þe weyl on þys, ?yf þou a?en þys haue do ou?t mys. The fyrst askyng ys yn oure boke, ‘?yf þou euer god forsoke;’ Any tymë, as for nede, Or for folye, or for drede, Or ouþer chaunce þat you weyl woste, Forsoke fadyr and sone and holy goste. For þys ys one þe mostë synne Þat any man may fallyn ynne. ?yf þou haue synned þus gretly, With sory herte þou aske mercy. For god ys ful euer of pyte, Hys mercy ys euer redy to þe. Drede þe noght; ?yf þou wylt craue, Hys mochel mercy shalt þou haue. And þat may wel [i-]preuyd be Wyþ a tale of auctoryte. Þe tale ys wrytyn, al and sum, In a boke of ‘Vitas Patrum:’— [The Tale of the Tempted Monk.] Hyt was onys a munke, and had a celle In a wyldernes, for to dwelle; Þys munkë of relygyoun Had a grete temptacyoun; He was so temptyd with lecherye, He ?ede fro hys celle to seke folye; He dede hym sone to a cyte, In-to egypte, þat yche cuntre. And, as hé cam yn a strete, with a womman he gan mete; Hys flesshe on here was so abeyted, Þat þyke womman he couéytyd. To here fadyr swyþe he ?ede, And asked here to haue yn dede. Here fadyr was prest of sarysyne; In maummetry he leued ynne. Þe prest seyd þe munke vn-to, As my god wyl, so wyl y do. She shal noght to any be sette Withoutyn leue of my maumette. The munkë seyd he graunted weyl Aftyr hys maumette to do euery deyl. Þe sarysyne to hys god ?ede, And askede cunseyl of swyche a dede, ?yf he were of þe munkë payde, Or, þe ?yfte shulde be delayde.’ Þan answered hys termagaunt, “?yue hym þy doghtyr on þys cunnaunt, Þat he forsake, &amp; quytë clene, God of heuene and hys bapteme, And alle þe godenesse of hys munkhede; Þese þre forsakë, mote he nede; And ?yf he forsake hem apertly, ?yue hym þy dou?tyr hardëly.” Þys prest come to þe munke, &amp; tolde what he seyd, and what he wolde; ‘And ?yf he wolde forsake þese þre, Hys dougtyr shulde hys ownë be.’ She was so mochë yn hys þoght; Had he here, he rou?te of noghte. Alas! Ihesus he forsoke, And þe crystyndom þat he toke, And þe state of relygyoun, And chesë hys Dampnacyun. Certys he dede grete outrage, To make þe deuyl so moche omage. whan he had grauntede al hys folye, Out of hys mouþe he say flye A dowue vn-to þe fyrmament; Þe holy gost þan from hym went. Þe sarysyne wente to hys maumet, And tolde hym how þe munke had het: “Þese þre þyngës” he wyl forsake; Shal y, hym my dou?tyr take? Sey þou me þe certeyn of alle, wheþer y shal, or y ne shalle.” Þe maumet answeryd hastyly, “Y warne þe for enchesoun why; Þogh he forsake hys god for euere, Hys god forsakeþ hym neuere, For he ys euer ful of pyte; Men clepyn hym god of cristianite; For ?yf he wyl hym mercy craue, Redyly mercy shal he haue; Þou?e he to-day fro hys god weyue, To-morwe hys god wyl hym receyue. Þarfor, y forbede þe weyl, Ne delë with hym neuer a deyl.” Þe prest vnto þe munkë went And seyd, “y haue commaundëment Þat y ne shal delë with þe, Ne my doghtyr þy wyfe to be; For þy god ys of swych manere, Þogh þou forsake hym ryght now here, To-morwe mayst þou com a?eyn, And make with hym acorde certeyn; Þogh þou haue do neuer so ylle ?yt wyl he graunte þe hys gode wylle. My god me bad on none wyse To dele with þe, ne none of hyse.” Þe munke rependyd hym þan, and þoght, “Alas!” he seyd, “what have y wroght Þat y shulde euer hym forsake Þat ys so redy me efte to take. Þy mercy, god, ys mochyl to telle; when y see a maumet of helle Þat neuer ?yt loued þe, He spekyþ of þy mochyl pyte. Seþyn þou art so mylde and meke Þy mochyl mercy wyl y seke; Here y forsakë þat y toke, To hym y me betake þat y forsoke.” Seþyn he ?ede to an ermyte, And shrofe hym of hys synne astyte; And tolde hym þat he had y-doun, Forsaken god and hys relygyoun. þys forsayde ermyte ful sory was Þat he had do so grete trespas; Noþeles, he bad hym dwelle Þre wokys with hym yn his celle; For hys synne he shulde þan faste, And yn preyers wel to laste. þys ychë munke þat was so madde, Dyde ryght as þe ermyte badde. þey preyden boþe þat seueny?t To god, for hys mochel my?t, þat he wulde haue of hym mercy; Þus preyd þey boþë specyaly.

Þe bysshop merueyled, &amp; oþer mo, how þat she my?t do hyt go. “Dame,” seyd þe bysshop, “do þy quentyse, And late vs se how hyt shal ryse.” Þys wycche here charme began to sey, Þe slop ros vp, and ?ede þe weye. Þe bysshop seyd, “þys haue we seyn; Do hyt now to lygge a?eyn.” Þe wycchë dede al at hys wylle: She made þe slop a?en lygge stylle, Þe bysshop made a clerk þan wryte Al þat she seyd, mochel and lyte, And allë how she made here went; Þe bysshop þarto ?af gode entent. “Þan,” seyde þe bysshop, “now shal y, As þou hast do, do þy maystry.” Þe bysshop bygan þe charme to rede, And as she dyde, he dyde yn dede; He seyd and dedë euery deyl, Ry?t as she dede, he dede as weyl. Þe sloppe lay stylle, as hyt ded wore, For hym ne ros hyt neuer þe more. “why,” seyd he, “wyl hyt nat ryse, And y haue do þe samë wyse, And seyd þe wurdys, lesse ne mo, And for my seyyng wyl hyt nat go?” “Nay,” she seyd, “why shuld hyt so? ?e beleue nat as y do: wlde ?e beleue my wrdys as y, Hyt shulde a go, and sokun ky.” He seyd, “þan fayleþ noght but beleuyng;” She seyd, “þat helpeþ al my þyng; And so hyt ys for ourë lawe, Beleue ys morë þan þe sawe; For, þou mayst sey what þou wylt, But þou beleue hyt, ellys ys alle spylt; Alle þat y seyd, y beleue hyt weyl, My beleue haþ do þe dede euery deyl.” Þe bysshop comaundyd þat she shuld no?t Beleue ne wurche as she had wro?t.

Þe caytefe lay, and my?t nat speke; Furþ, for ded, men gan hym streke; Men crydë fast ‘a prest, a prest.’ But no wrde come out of hys brest. As þey stode, &amp; made grete þrong, A gode man stodë hem a-mong, And seyd “þys man ys at þe ded; wyl ?e do allë at my rede? Allë men þat þys chaunce sees, Syttyþ dowun vpp-on ?oure knees; And pray we god, þat alle þyng may, And to oure lady þat owyþ þys day, Þat she graunte vs swyche a ?yfte Þat he may speke, &amp; take hys shryfte, In swych a forward, þat he &amp; we Shul euer more chastyed be.” when þey to prey on knees gan falle, Þe man spake fyrst among hem alle: “whan y swore, he seyd, so hastly, Þat y wlde nat leue, for oure lady, Ne halewe þys day of my note, An hande y sagh come to my þrote, And hyldë me þarby so sore Þat y to ?ow my?t speke no more. Oure lady was with me so wroþe Þat y swore by here an oþe, Þat y wlde nat leue for here to werche Þoght men rong noun at þe cherche; Ne here helpe hadde be, þat was so nere, Þe hand me haddë strangled here. And ?e þat stondeþ me bysyde, Þat preyd for me þat ychë tyde, Blessed mote ?e allë be For ?oure preyers haþ saued me.” Of þys tale ys alle þe entent To kepe weyl þe commaundëment,— Þat ys, to holde wel þyn halyday In allë þyngë þat þou may. Ne þou shalt swere vnwurschyply, By oure lorde, ne by oure lady.

[The Fourth Commandment.] The fourþe comaundment ys, “oure Fadyr &amp; modyr we shal honoure.” Certys þe chylde trespasyþ ful yl Þat wyl nat do þe fadrys wyl; Þe chylde owyþ hys wyl al do, But dedly synne be þar-vnto; For god forbedeþ swych synne algate, For loue, or for drede, erly or late.

Vnneþys shuld þey mercy fynde, For swyche a chylde ys kalled vnkynde; No bysshope may ?yue þerfore dome But þe pope of þe court of Rome. ?yf þou were euer so felun To ?yue fadyr or modyr þy malysun, Or stonde a?ens hem yn answere, And wldest nat bowë ne forbere, Þou hast synned þan dedly, To endëles penaunce wurþy, But sonë þou þer-of þe shryue And be bowyng yn al þy lyue. ?yf þy fadyr or modyr bydde þe ou?t do, And þou wylt nat bleþly þarto By þy wyl, but euer gruchande, Þou shalt weyl vndyrstande, Þat, þogh þou do forþe þy dede, Þat synne ys mochë for to drede. Þou oghtyst to bere penaunce grym, For þou greuyst a lytyl hym. with al þy myght, and ry?t gode wyl, Þy fadrys byddyng þou shalt fulfyl. ?yf fadyr or modyr falle yn elde, And noþer, for pouert, may hem self welde, Here chyldryn are holdë þan, þurgh ry?t, To susteyn hem at alle here myght. ?yf þey se hem so at mysese And þey may lyuë wel at ese, But þey help hem, þey are to blame And wrþy to haue wrldës shame. Þoght þey hauë þe mysdoun, Þou shalt nát fynde enchesoun Þat þyn help be fro hem went, For hyt were a?ens þe comaundment. Y se men þat purchasours are, Þat coueyte catel with sorwe &amp; kare Here chyldryn godë for to wynne, And here soulës synke for synne. And oþer men also y see, Þat ?yue here chyldryn boþe lond &amp; fee For to fynde hem sustynaunce yn here age, for allë chaunce. Þo men, me þynkeþ, most mysdo, Þat ?yue here godë fro hem so; Hyt were bettyr holde here land, Þan begge hyt at a-nouþers hand: Men wexen sone sadde of hem þat craue When þey weyl wete þat þey naght haue. By a tale, y shal ?ou mone,warne Þat fyl betwyx þe fadyr &amp; þe sone. [The Tale of the Fond Father.] Of a man þat sum tyme was, y shal ?ou telle a lytyl pas. Of hys sone he was gelous, And ?aue hym alle hys land &amp; hous, And al hys catel in toune &amp; felde, þat he shulde kepe hym wel yn hys elde. Þys ?ong man wax fast, &amp; was iolyfe, hys cunseyl was to take a wyfe; he weddyd one, &amp; broght here home with alle þe myrþe þat þerto come; He badde here fyrst, loude and stylle, To serue hys fadyr weyl at hys wylle. Sone aftyrwarde, þys ?ongë man, Hys herte, hys þoght, chaunge began; Tendrere he was of wyfe and chylde, Þan to hys fadyr oþer meke or mylde. Of o day, he þoght [four or] fyue; Long hym þoght hys fadyr a-lyue; And euery day, boþe þe toon and þe toþer, Serued hym weyl wers þan oþer. Y trowe þys man, whan he gan mone For þoght þat he ?af so meche hys sone, Þys oldë man was broght so logh Þat he lay ful colde besyde a wogh. Þys oldë man, vp-on a day, Pleyned hym þat he coldë lay: “Sone,” he seyde, “for goddys loue wrye me with sum cloþe aboue.” Þe sone, þat was þe husband To whom was ?yuë alle þe land, Clepyd hys sone, &amp; bade hym take A sak of þo þat he dede make, And badde hym turnë hyt tweyfolde And ley hyt on hys fadyr for colde. Þe chylde [dede] as he bad hym do, Toke a sak &amp; karf hyt yn two. Hys fadyr spakë to hym ?orne, “Sey, why hast þou þe sak shorne?” þe chylde answered hym yn haste A wurdë þurgh þe holy gaste, “Þys dedë haue y do for þe; Gode ensample ?yuyst þou me How y shal serue þe yn þy elde, whan þou, þy self, mayst nat welde; Þys halfe sak shal lygge þy fadyr aboue, And kepe þe touþer part to þy behoue. Vnkyndly þou techyst me þe gode; Of unkynde cumþ vnkyndë blode.” Þys ensample were gode to kone, Boþe to þe fadyr &amp; eke to þe sone. God ys noght payd, here we fynde, Þat þe sone to þe fadyr ys nat kynde. Þarfor spekþ Salamon To fadrys &amp; to husbandys echon, ‘Þe whylys þat ?e may drawe ?oure hand, Ne ?yueþ neuer awey ?oure land, And make ?oure self, sogettys to be To hem þat owyn ?ow seruee.’ Anoþer wysdom a clerk vs telleþ, Senek, þat moche of wysdom spellyþ, ‘Ne be þou neuere yn swych errour To make þyn eyr þy secutour, Ne þy sekutoure þy fysycyene, Yn hopë for to leue a-?ene.’ For þy þyng, þy eyr seyþ þys, Þat byfore was þyn, he halt hyt hys; Þyn executure, to haue þy þyng, wlde þat þou madyst þyn endyng. Þou owyst to do no þyng stylle withoute leue of þy fadrys wylle; Þat ys to seyë, take no wyfe For to make betwyxe ?ou stryfe; Ne no grete þyng beye ne selle ?yf þou vndyr hys gouernaunce dwelle. To relygyun þou mayst go withoutë cunseyl of any mo; And to holy land, ?yf þou haue hyt hette; Syb, ne vnsyb, may hyt lette. A clerk þat folylyche dyspendyth þe godys þat hys fadyr hym ?yueþ or sendyþ, And wyl nat ?yue hym for to lere Clergye ne craft, or ouþer mystere, wykkedlyche al þat gode he dyspendyþ þat hys fadyr for godenesse spelyþ. To hard a-cuncte shall he be sette At hys endyng, whan he shal be fette, Þat so hys tyme haþ al forlore, And a?ens hys fadyr so hym mysbore, But he ?elde hym, ?yf þat he may, Or preye for hym boþe nyght and day; For ?yf þou mayst, &amp; wylt noght, Þou art yn weye to peyne be broght. For a-noþer also þou mayst be shent: ?yf þou destroblyst here testament Yn here lyfe, or aftyr here ded, with powere or ?yft, cunseyl or rede, Þou hast trespast apertly A?ens þys cómaundment so hy. Of alle wykked men þat men calle, Þe fals executours be werst of alle;nota bene For þey ne reche how þe soulë fare, And mennys owne eyres, werst with hem are. y tolde erwhyle, for no socour Þou make þyn eyre þyn executour; For alle þat was langere þy catel, he halt hyt hys, euery deyl. ‘Loue þou þy chyldyr out of wytte; Trust to hem, and helples sytte.’ Ouþer ensample nedyþ þe noun take; what dost þou for þy fadrys sake, ?yt shal þy sone do for þe, les; For euer þe lastë, þe werst es. On hem y rede þyn herte so kest, Þat þou louë þy self best; Loue so þy chyldyr, loue so þy wyff, Þat þou saue þe, boþe soule &amp; lyff. Loue fadyr &amp; modyr, þat þe forþe brou?t, Þenk on þat loue whan þey may nou?t. Seynt poule þat sagh goddys pryuyte, he seyþ yn hys autoryte A feyrë wurd vs for to saue, And specyaly to hem þat chyldryn haue: He seyþ “be ?e neuer so fole hardy To curse ?oure chyldryn byttyrly; Ne greuusly, for lytyl trespas, Betechë hem to satanas.” Moche ys ?our malysun to drede; Curseþ hem noght; y ?ow forbede. Oft haue men boþe herde &amp; see Þat moche veniaunce þerfor haþ bee. For to leue ?oure cursyng bolde, Y shal ?ow telle what me was tolde Of a prest þat sagh and fonde Þys chauncë yn þe holy londe. [The Tale of the Mother who curst her Child.] A womman on a day ful raþe ?ede to a watyr here for to baþe, And to[ke] here doghtyr here cloþys to kepe, And baddë here she shuld nat slepe; “But, as sone as y þe kalle, Be redy with my cloþys alle.” whan she was baþed, she kalled here faste, And bade here brynge here cloþys yn haste. Here dou?tyr was nat alle redy, Ne comë nat at here fyrst cry. Þe modyr þat sat in here baþ wax ful of ire and of wraþ, And cleþyd eft-sonys aftyr here, kursyng with ryghte gretë yre, And seyd, “þe devyl come on þe, For, þou art nat redy to me.” “And y am redy,” seyd þe deuyl, “To take þat þou me betaght with euyl.” he flegh on herë þere she stode, And madë herë wytte al wode. Þys godë man for a-nouþer þyng Tolde hyt oft yn hys prechyng, Þat none durste speke with here syþyn But ?yf he werë clenë shryuyn; For ?yf he were yn dedely synne, Þe fendë þat was here with-ynne Made here seye hym so moche shame Þat alle men wundred on hys blame. And þat was preued with many one Þat to þe holy lond was gone. Þerfore, ?e chyldryn, before al þyng Dredyþ ?oure modrys warryng; And, ?e wyuys, þenkeþ on þys cas, werryþ nat for lytyl trespas. Þey þat wyl gladly warye, hem warryþ god &amp; seynt marye. For ho-so haunteþ hyt comunly Yn ernest or yn rybaudy, He shall haue warryng for blysse, And of blessyng shal he mysse; And ho-so curseþ withoutyn gylt Hyt shal on hys hede be pylt. Curser[y]s yn alle here lyue Shal neuer haue grace for to þryue; As þey vse, so shal hem falle, For kursyng shal come on hem alle. wurschepyþ ?oure fadrys, &amp; ?oure fadrys ?ow, Þan queme ?e God, and doun ?oure prow. God ?yue vs grace to oure endyng To kepe vs fro modrys cursyng, And oure fadrys so to queme; Þat goddys comaundement we may ?eme. [The Fifth Commandment.] To þe fyfþe now shul we go, Þat ys, ‘þou shalt no man slo.’ Þe fyfþë, shalt þou vndyrstonde, Ys, ‘sle no man with þyn honde, with-outyn iustyce, for felonye, Ne for no manere of robbrye.’ ?yf þou do any man yn prysun, wykkedly, as a fals felun, Or bynde yn upland or in burgh, Þat he haue hys deþe þer-þurgh,— Certeyn þe shal no þyng were, Þat for hys deþ þou shalt answere. ?yf þou euer yn any tyme Reftë any man hys lyme, Or hyt was reftë þurgh þy rede, Þou art enchesun of hys dede. ?yf hyt be a?ens hys wylle Or hys asent, þou synnest ful ylle. ?yf þou þurgh wykked ordynaunce Fordost pore mannys sustynaunce þat aftyrward he may nat lyue, þou art coupable,—a ?yfte y ?yue. ?yf a porë man þe craue A melys mete, hys lyfe to saue,— ?yf þou mayst ?yue hym, &amp; nat wylt, Beforë god þou hast hym spylt.

Be he neuer so strong a þefe, ?yf he may ?yue, he shal be lefe; A porë man þat may nat so, Þe deþë þey wyl dampne hym to. Also hyt ys of þys dormers yn tounne,— Falsë treytours &amp; feloune,— þat falslychë, for enuye, On here neghburs wyl gladly lye, And seye forsoþe þat he haþ wroght Þyng þat neuer ?yt was do ne þoght. þey sle hem allë þat þey may, whan here gode los þey fordo for ay. yn alle þe wrlde, no ys more felonye, Þan of þy neghbur next þe by. ?yf þou euer dedyst þyn entent yn fals cunsél or cómaundment, Þat a man to þe deþe were dyght with wrong dome, or euyl syght; Þoght hyt semyd with þe lawe To ?eue þe dome, hyt ys grete awe who-so demyþ felunsly, And noþer wyþ pyte ne mercy; he [ne] shal no mercy haue, Þat alle wyl sle, and no man saue. y shal ?ow telle for swychë dome A tale þat sum tyme fyl yn Rome. Of holy wryt, þe englysh y toke, ‘Dialogus,’ men clepyn þe boke. Þys tale ys wryte þer-yn redy, And fyl yn þe tyme of seynt Gregory. [The Tale of the Knight who had a Vision of the Judgment.] yn Romë fyl a grete moreyne, A pestelens of men, a veniaunce to pyne, For some þat ?edë yn þe strete Sawe arwys fro heuene shete, And smote men to þe deþ doun ry?t; And one of þe arwys wounded a kny?t. Þe kny?t ful sorë syke gan lye, And was yn poynt as he shuld deye; hys spyryt was take to see a cas, Ryght as goddys wyllë was. hys frendys þat stode hym by wende þat he hadde be dede bodely. But sonë, yn a lytyl þrowe, Þe body quaked þat þey alle sowe: Seþþë he tolde where he hadde be, And mochë þyng þat he hadde see. “y sagh a brygge of mochë wndyr, A grymly watyr was þer vndyr, Blak and depe &amp; ful stynkyngge, Dredeful noyse hyt made rynnyngge. Dunward yn-to helle hyt ?ede; whan y sagh hyt, y hadde grete drede. Be-?unde þat brygge was a cuntre, Þe feyreste þat euer god lete be; As a medue hyt was grene, So feyre of syght ys noun, y wene, So ful of flourys logh and hygh, And saueryd swete as spycerye. Þarto so feyre syght of coloure, Delytable, &amp; swete of sauoure, Y dar weyl seye þat euermore A man myght leuë þat were þore; Deyë certys shuld he neuere, For lyue and hele ys þere for euere. y sagh þere folk [of so feyr syghte, Here wonynge placys yn joye were dyghte; All þe folke] þat I saghe þere were as feyre as aungelys were. y sagh þere housys of ful ryche atyre, Alle of gletryng golde as fyre; Blesful bryghtenes was þerynne; Þe syght was cely, &amp; welþe to wynne; For, some of þo wynly wones were peynted with precyus stones, Some were caste with ryche colours And feyr peynted with frute &amp; floures. Þere ys noun lyuyng here a lyue, But criste, þat may hyt alle dyscryue. Þe soþë myght y neuer wytte, who shuld yn þo stedys sytte. But yn þe watyr þat was hydus, Sstynkyng, blak, &amp; merueylus, y say moche folk falle þerynne, Caytyuys charged ful of synne. A myste out of þe watyr come, And to sum housys hyt gan gone, And to sum, come hyt noght, Þat me merueyled yn my þoght. Þe bregge þat ouere þe watyr lay, Hyt was euer of swyche a-say, Þat þer-ouere myght no man passe But he were clene of euery trespas Þat he ne shulde yn þe watyr falle To þe mayster fende of alle. Þo men þat loue to do ryghtly, Þey shal passe þere sauëly Into þat blesful cuntre, Þere ioyë withoute ende shal be. A preste y sagh passe þere weyl, And hadde no lettyng of any deyl, As he hadde leuyd yn hys lyfe clene, At hys passyng was hyt weyl sene. A man y kneugh þere yn peynys strong. Þat felunlyche dyde euer wrong; I knegh hym here yn grete bayly, He loued veniaunce with-oute mercy. ‘Pers,’ y wote weyl, was hys name, Yn þe watyr he suffred shame. y sagh hym bere vpp-on hys krowne Brynnyng eryn þat bare hym downe In-to þe watyr, blak as kole. Alas, þe paynes y sagh hym þole! Moche y desyred to wete certeyne why he suffred al þat peyne; And asswyþe hyt was me tolde, For to do veniaunce he was euere bolde; And whan he shuldë deme þe ry?t, To felunly he dyde hys my?t; At hym myght no man hauë grace, Myldenesse, ne mercy, for any trespace; And for he dede so mochë wogh, Suffreþ he now shame ynogh. Swyche ys goddys ordynaunce, ‘For veniaunce to take veniaunce.’ ?yt of a-noþer y had a syght, ‘Steuene,’ forsoþe, hys namë hyght; Þat yche Steuene was wont to be wonyng yn Romë, þys cyte. As he wulde passe þe brygge, betydde, Hys fete begunne to slyde besyde, And, was yn poynt for to falle In-to þe watyr bytterer þan galle; Þe fendës wende weyl hym to fonge, But by þe bregge þan gan he honge. Þe fendys here crokys fasted yn hys knees, And al to-drowe &amp; rente hys þees; Feyr men come þedyr,—but y not how,— And by hys armys vp hym drow; Þey wulde nat suffre hym falle al downe In-to þat grete confucyoun; He plesyd god with sum gode dede, Þarefore þey hylpe hym yn hys nede. Almysdede men vndyrstonde By þe drawyng vp of hys honde. Y trowe he trespast yn lecherye Þat þey þe þeës drow hym by. But forsoþe y can nat telle wheþyr he shulde to heuene or helle.” Þys talë haue y tolde to ?ow, ?yf hyt my?t fallë ?ow to prow, Þys domus men, to chastyse, Þat deme men wrong þurgh fals asyse. Many beyn now, as Pers was, Harde domys men as Satanas. Þat man þat demeþ alle to þe ry?t, Of mercy get he no ply?t; And ?yf he demeþ pytyffully At hys demyng getyþ he mercy; And ?yf he deme fals iuggëment, Þere falsnes ys, he shalle be shent; He shal be slayn, þat al wyl slo; Þat peyne wyl deme, to pyne shal go. ?yf þou with-drowe any mannys wyl, Þat he ne my?t þe gode fulfyl whan he þoght to haue wel doun, Or entycedest any fro relygyoun, Gostly þou mayst hym slo Þyf he to ouþer wykkednes go:— As, ?yf a man haue a chylde, And to relygyun hys wyl be mylde, And þou eggyst hym away To folue þe fals wrldës pay; ?yf he þarefore be lore yn synne, For hym grete perel þou fallyst ynne; Byforë god þou hast hym slayn, And for hym þou shalt suffre payn. what sey ?e of þys bakbyters Þat wykked wurdes aboutë bers? Þey makë oftë mochë stryfe, And a-peyryn many mannys lyfe. ?yf þou bryng a man yn fame, Þat he haue euer lastyng shame,— Byforë god, þou hym slos whan þou hym reuyst hys gode los.

Þou wost weyl, with-outyn les, þe bakbyter fyrst hym self sles; He slekþ hym þat trowyþ hys lesyng, whan he forþ beryþ hys bakbytyng; And hym algate þat hyt ys on leyde, He ys slayn; god help þe vpbreyde. As mochë þan he ys to blame Þat ?eueþ a man a vyle ekename; ?yf hys ry?t name be withdrawe, Gostlychë þou hast hym slawe. Also ys slaghter gostly To vse to spekë vyleyny.

A tale Seynt Gregori of a nunne tellys Þat ?ede to helle for no þyng ellys But for she spake euer vyleyny Among here felaws al ahy. Þys nunnë was of dedys chaste, But þat she spakë wurdys waste She madë many of here felawys Þenke on synnë for her sawys. For many tyme a vyleynys wurde Gadryþ foulë þouþ to hurde. So dede she her felawys alle, For here wurdys, yn synnë falle. Noþeles, yn here dedys, Se was chaste as men er hedys. Sone aftyr þys nunnë deyde, As of herë was purueyde, She was beryyd, as fyl to be, Be syde an auter before þe gre. Sone aftyr, þys chaunce gan falle:— Of þe cherche þe wardeynys alle were waked oute of here slepe, So loude þey herde one cry &amp; wepe; Þey sterte vp allë for to see what wundyr þyng þat my?t be.

Þe wardeynys come eft on þe morow To see where had be þat sorow. þey fonde þe brenyng euery deyl As þey before had seye hyt weyl; Half þe body was brent a-way, And haluyndele yn her grauë lay. Seynt Gregorye seyþ þat hyt was sygne Þat half here lyfë was nat dygne; For þogh here dedys werë chaste, Here wurdys were al vyle &amp; waste. So was hyt shewyd before here ygne, Þat haluyndele she was ?oue to pyne. Loke how ?euene dome þer was, Euene lyke a?ens here trespas. See how here tunggë made here slayn And foulë wurdes broght here to payn. By þys ensample þat vs awysferyþ Y rede þat we leue alle oure foule sawys, Þat we sle nat vs self gostly, Ne noun ouþer so, ne bodyly, Þat we be nat with herë brent Yn hellë fere, no with here shent.

[The Sixth Commandment.] The syxte comaundyþ vs al so, Þat we shul noun hurdam do. þys comaundment ys of prys, For hyt was stabled yn paradys God stablede hyt, þou shalt beleue, whan he made of Adam, Eue. A clene womman here he hym betaght, Yn clenë lyfe to lyue she aght; Al one to be, and of o wyl, Goddys comaundment to fulfyl. God made womman man to gyue,kepe To be hys helpë yn hys lyue; he madë here nat, man to greue, No to be mayster, but felaw leue, No nat ouer logh, no nat ouer hy, But euene felaw, to be hym by; And he, mayster, lorde, &amp; syre; To hys wyl she shal meke hyre. Þe sacrament ys for here sake, Of two, o fleshe and o wyl, to make. Grete mede he getyþ with-outë fayle Þat wele wyl holdë hys spousayle.

Þe ferst womman þat þou ches Ys þy wyfe, with-outë les. Ensample hauë we þerby, Of Iosep þat wedyd oure lady; Þere was verry matrymony, with-outë fleshly dede of any.

A?ens swyche maner wyuys þat wyl nat amende here lyuys, Shal y tellë ?ow a tale,— To swychë wyuys byttyr bale. [The Tale of the Adulterous Wife, whose Skeleton split in two.] Þer ys an Ile be-?unde þe see, Þer men were wunt wonyng to be; Þys ychë ylë wax al waste, And þe folk drogh þen yn haste; So with-ynne a lytyl whyle Men helde hyt a forsakyn yle.

Þe ermyte seydë, “?e shul be In penauncë þre days with me; And, aftyr þe þre days ende, To ?ow shal y come or sende.” Alle þe folk went home þere weye; Þe ermyte hys preyere began to seye, “Ihesu cryst, god almyghty, Of þys folk haue þou mercy, Þat þou boghtyst on rode so dere; For hem shewe me on sum manere where y may þe dragun fynde, And hys power, lorde, þou bynde, Þat þe folk may knowe and se Þe mercy and þe my?t of þe.” Whan he hadde preyde hys orysun Long yn grete afflyccyun, God sagh allë hys entent, And hys aungel to hym he sent For to techë hym þe way Þedyr þere þe dragun lay. Þe aungel seyde to þe ermyte, “Do sumnë þe folk astyte, Þat þey comë allë hedyr Beforë þe, echone to gedyr.

Þey sagh a womman þere vyly lye, And here body cloue yn twey partye; Betwyxe þo twey partys þe dragun lay, Gresly to se wyþ grete affray. Grete wndyr was hyt to see; Þey asked alle what hyt my?t be, And why hyt was, and wherë-fore, Þat þe dragun lay so þore; And what manere she synned so, Þat here body was cloue yn two. he shewede þan vnto hem alle, For what synne þat sorow gan falle. “Þys womman,” he seyd, “þat here lys, And ys departyd yn two partys, She was weddyd, and here wedlak Ful falsly an on-truly brak, whan she was o flessh and blode with hym þat here to-keyn loue gode; þurgh matrymony, þe sacrament, were two o flessh made be assent, holy togedyr for to leue And noun fro ouþer hys flesh may ?yue.

For þe foule dragun, þe fende of helle, wyþ hém yn peyne shal euer dwelle Þat half here flesh haue partyd or brokun Þat holy yn matrymony was lokun. ?yf þer be twey yn cumpany As beþ yn wedlak specyaly, And þe toon do a?ens spousayle whereforë felaushepe may fayle, But þe toþer wyl hym blame whan he wote hys foulë fame, he consentyþ to hys synne But he desturble hym þer-ynne. ?yf þou wendest oute of cuntre, A?ens þy wyuys wyl to be, But she mow wonë yn þat stede To haue þy fleshly felawrede, ?yf þou do hyt a?ens her wyl Certeynly þou synnyst ful yl. ?yf þou hyt do to holde þe chaste wyþ-oute here wyl, þou werchyst waste. For but hyt be for grete resun, ?yf she mysdo, þou art enchesun. ?yf þou louyst to haue þy wyfe Yn clennes and yn godë lyfe, vpbreyde here neuer for gelusye Of no mannys cumpanye; For ?yf þou dost, þan wyl she do þyng þat she neuer þoghte to do. Men sey, þer a man ys gelous, Þat þer ys a kokewolde at hous. Many a gode man ys kokewolde; Þere þe wyfe ys a shrewe, þer ys wykked holde. But where þe wyfe haþ gelousye Þere beþ wrdys grete and hye; here mayster shal nagher go ne sytte Þat she ne shal wommen on hym wytte. Þan ys þere chydyng and boste, Þere ys nat þe holy goste; For no þyng Ihesu cryst more quemeþ Þan loue yn wedlak, þere men hyt ?emyþ; Ne no þyng ys to man so dere As wommanys loue yn gode manere. A gode womman ys mannys blys Þere here loue ry?t and stedfast ys; Þere ys no solas vndyr heuene Of al þat a man may neuene, Þat shuld a man so mochë glew As a gode womman þat loueþ trew. Ne derer ys none yn goddys hurde Þan a chaste womman with louely wrde; Ensample haue y þerof ful fayre yn þe lyfe of seynt Makayre. [The Tale of St. Macaire and the Two Good Married Women.] Þere was an abbot of great renoun, An holy man yn relygyoun, he preydë god vpp-on a day, And seydë “lorde, as þou weyl may, ?eue me gracë for to wete who shal with me yn heuene sytte; Þat wulde y wyte on al manere, who yn heuene shal be my pere.” A voys spakë to hym ful fayre, “wete þou wele, for soþe, Makayre, Þere beþ twey wymmen yn a cyte, Of so moche boneryte þat alle þe penaunce þat þou mayst do Ne may nat reche here godenes to.” he toldë hym þe cyte ry?t, And the wommen what þey hyght. Makayrë wulde no lenger byde, But to þat cyte gan he ryde; As sonë as he comë þere he askede where swyche wymmen were. Men taghte hym sonë to hem weyl; he come and toke þere hys osteyl. “wymmen,” he seyde, “y wyl me reste yn ?oure Ine as a ny?tys geste.” “Syr,” þey seyde, “we graunte hyt þe ?yf þou hyt aske pur charyte.” To a chambre þey hym broghte; þan hys erende for?ate he noughte. he madë boþë by hym sytte, And seyde, “y am come, at ?ow to wytte yn what manere ?e lede ?oure lyuys yn holynes, and byþ here wyuys: Forheleþ hyt nat, y ?ow forbede, how þat ?e ?oure lyuys lede; Þarfore, y am come to þys cyte, And haue trauayled many a iurne.” Þes wymmen answered al at gesse “Syr, we knowe no holynesse, But whan oure husbandys byþ vs by Þan beþ we yn loue ry?tly, And yn parfyte charyte whan oure husbandys with vs be; Þys ys moste of ourë lyuys, And euer haþ be, syþ we were wyuys.” “y beseche ?ow, on my blessyng, Þat ?e forhele fro me no þyng.” Þe toon answered to seynt Makayre “To twey breþryn we weddyd are A-passyd be twenty ?ere Þat we to-gedyr haue lyuyd here, Þat neuer with hem were we onys wroth Ne þey with vs þat wedded vs both, Ne for no þyng þat euer may betyde To-gedyr shul we neuer chyde. Yn relygyun we wulde vs do; Oure husbondys graunte nat þar-to; ?yt haue we leuer leue oure wylle Þan oure hosbundys greue with ylle. So moche loue ys vs among Þat none to oþer wyl do wrong.” Among oþer þynges to hym þey spake, “We þenke so moche on oure wedlake, For hyt ys yn þe olde testament, And yn þe newe hyt ys sacrament; And God haþ ordeyned hyt for þe pes, And þeryn, be bore he ches, Þat we ne shul, by oure lyue, Neuermore to-gedyr stryue, Ne foly wrdys be betwyxe vs seyd— As ouþer wymmen makyn vpbreyd,— For noun enuye ne coueytyse, Ne for noun ouþer maner wyse; But seruë god and oure husbondys yn alle þyng þat he sendeþ hys sondys.” Makayre ioyed þat þey were so stable, And so long whylë so tretable; he þankeþ God þat he haþ founde So mylde wymmen yn wedlak bounde; he toke hys leue and went hys weye, As an abbot shulde, to hys abbeye. God wuld hyt werë now so here, So meke wymmen of so fayre manere; But of ouþer, men mowe fynde wymmen yn wedlak ry?t on-kynde, Þat for a gamë wurde yn veyn Þey wyl ?yuë forty a?eyn. Se how þese wymmen a-cordaunce Plesyd god with lytyl penaunce, And preysed hem to seynt Makayre For þey bare hem yn wedlak fayre; As mochë þan shal he hem blame, Þat chydyn to-gydyr, &amp; reysyn shame. ?yf þou euer þy wyfe lay by Yn tyme of penaunce, to seye flesshly,— ?yf þou be custumable þar-to, Þou synnest gretly, my boke seyþ so. yn holy tyme and halyday Forbere þy wyfe, ?yf þat þou may. Ne þou shalt nat know þy wyfe yn holy placë, by þy lyfe; ?yf þou do hyt custumably, Þou synnest, y sey, dedly; Cherche or cherchë?erd, y sey, yn holy stede hyt ys grete eye. yn lentyn tymë of fastyng Shalt þou leue to do swyche þyng. yn estyr tyme also, y forbede Þat þou haunte any swyche dede. ?yf a womman yn hordam do swyche outrage Þat a wrong eyre bere herytage; But she wul seye hyt, y dar wel telle Þat she þarfore may go to helle; For she ys cursed, yn stedys sere, Fourë tymës yn þe ?ere. And swyche an eyre, y vndyrstande, Shal neuer wel reioshe hys lande. Many synnës to hordam longe; Sum byþ ly?t, and sum beþ stronge, Þat beþ a?ens ry?t spousale, Þat y nel rekene, ne telle of tale, But opunly þat seyd may be; For many longe to pryuyte. For pryuytees, ?yf y hem named Ly?t[e]ly my?t y be blamed. But þogh a man sey neuer so weyl Vnto hys sawys men fyden teyl.scorne Þat weddyd beþ, God ?yue hem my?t, here wedlak to holdë weyl and ry?t, And ?yue hem grace, hordam to fle, Þat yn clenesse wuld leue and be. [The Seventh Commandment.] The seuenþe shul we nat forhele ‘No mannys godë shalt þou stele,’ For þys ys one of ten; Þarefore y pray allë men Þat þey kepe hem fro þys synne, For þere ys moche veniauuce þerynne; yn þys worldë, shamely dede;deþ And seþyn, helle; for god hyt forbed. God forbedyþ men to stele Any maner of worldës wele. “Þou man, beþenke þe wel before how þou mayst þerfore be lore, And what þou shalt haue þarefore, yn þys world, and elyswhore.” But manyone wyl neuer beware Tyl sum myschaunce make hem a?enchare; Slayn, or, yn prysun be, Or hanged, þat al þe worlde may se. So shul men þe body shende; And ?yt to peyne þe soule shal wende. wuldë men se what myschaunce Cumþ for þeft, and what penaunce, Þeftë shulde nat be so lefe; A foule poynt ys, be clepyd a þefe. Ouþer poyntes of wykkednes Mow be soffred, sum more, sum les; But þefte serueþ of wykkede note,seruyse hyt hangeþ hys mayster by þe þrote, Or doþe hym lese hys godë fame, Or bryngeþ hym oute of þe towne forshame. ‘Þefte shal neuere more be hyd, For, here or elyswhore, hyt shal be kyd;’ Þus seyþ þe prophete þat men on leuys, And spekeþ to fals men and to þeuys. Þe synne ys nat for?yuen þe man But he restore þat he haue tan; For ?yf þou make any man falsly tyne,lese As for þeft, þou shalt haue pyne; And mochë more, for swyche falsnes, Þan for any ouþer falsnes þat es. A gode ensample þes clerkys wote Of a tale þat an abbot wrote, Þat þeuys shulde before hem loke Ar þey ouþer mennys þyng toke;— yn ‘vytas patrum’ hyt ys wryte; hyt ys a boke þat clerkys wete, And ful fayre techyng ys þer-ynne For to leue of þeft þe synne. [The Tale of Zenon, the would-be Thief: how he reformd himself.] Þys yche abbot, ?enon he hyght, And wel he was with god almyght; Vppon a day he went hys wey To Palestyne, þat ys an abbey, To make hys vysytacyun As falleþ yn relygyun; And as he went by þe strete he behelde a fruyt ry?t feyre and swete; Þys yche fruyt he desyred faste, And hys herte moche þarto he caste, ‘Gourdys’ þus men clepe þe name; Þys gode man þoght, “y am to blame ?yf y take ouþer mennys þyng wyþ-outë leue of any askyng. For soþe, he seyde, þan were y a þefe And þefte ne ys gode, ne gode man lefe; And ?yf y stele, y am a felun; hanged y shal be, þurgh ry?t resun.

Fyuë days he hyng þere stylle A?ens þe sunnë by hys wylle; And hyt was yn þe somerys tyde, whan þe hete ys al yn pryde. Þan seyd he, to hymself þore, “Þys peynë wyl y suffre no more: Þefte, he seyde, y here forsake; Þys fruyt, wyl y nat take. Syn y may nat suffre for grefe Þe peyne þat befalleþ to a þefe.” Þys ensample were gode to kone, Alle hem þat to þefte hem wone; Þo þat haue here handys as lyme, To hem were gode to here þys ryme; Þan myght þey wytë redly what shamë þat þey were wurþy, And swych grace my?t god hem sende Þat þey, þurgh þys my?t hem amende.

[The Tale of the Knight who robd a Poor Man.] Sum tymë was, hyt were twey kny?tys Þat loued weyl at herë my?tys; A sykenes on þe toon gan falle, he deydë sone, as we shul alle.

Me were leuere deye an hundyr syþe Þan suffre þys peyne þat noght may lyþe.” Þan seyde þe kny?t, &amp; wepe ful sore, “My swete felaw, telle me ?yt more, ?yf any þyng be so certeyne Þat may delyuer þe of peyne.” Þan seyd þe kny?t, “y my?t be clere Þurgh þe sacrament of þe autere.” Þe kny?t nemnede prestes manyone; Þan stode þe dedë, stylle as stone, “wylt þou þan any of þese for þe syng, Þe of peynë for to brynge?” Þe dede meuede hys hede to &amp; fro, For he was payd of noun of þo. wete ?e forsoþe, boþe man and wyfe, Þey were nat of clenë lyfe; Of hem þe dede ?af noun answere, he made no fors of here preyere. Neþeles, þe seluyn messe ys noþer þe wursë, ne þe lesse; Þe sunne, hys feyrnes neuer he tynes, Þogh hyt on þe muk hepe shynes, But þe muk ys þe more stynkyngge Þere þe sunne ys more shynyngge. Ne more hyt ys lore, þe vertu Of þe messe, but mannys pru. Þogh þe prest be fals or frow, Þe messe, ys euer gode ynow; But þe preyere haþ no my?t, For hys lyfe ys nat clene dy?t. Þe kny?t nemnede one at þe laste, A gode man, and a ry?t stedefaste: “wylt þou þat he preye for þe?” Þo seyde þe dede “wel were þan me ?yf he wuldë for me syngge, he my?t me of peynës bryngge.” Þe kny?t seyd truly, “truste to me, Þat samë prest shal prey for þe; And þat þy peyne mow be þe lasse, Euery day shal he for þe synge a masse.” “May y þan trust to þy sawe Þat þou be now my trew felawe?” “?e, as y am a trew kny?t, hyt shal be do, at my my?t.” “A tokene betwyxe þe and me,” Þan seyd þe dedë, “shal þys be?” he toke and grepe þe kny?tys arme, But he felt þer-of none harme; Also he touched hys bare þe; Þe bare bone my?t men euer after se; But sorë þerof felt he noght, But for þe felyng, more on hym he þoght. Þat mark saw alle men comunly, But no man wyst redely why. Þe dedë seyd “þou shalt leue here No lenger but þys two ?ere.” he tolde what day þat he shuld deye, And seþyn he went forþe hys weye. Þe kny?t amended seþyn hym weyl, And to þe dede was as trew as steyl; For he dede as he hym hette, Þe prest for hym song þat he hem hette. Þys aperyng, yn my auys, Auayled to boþe partys. Seþyn toke þe kny?t palmers wede, And yn to þe holy londe he ?ede; Ihesu cryst sepulcre he soght, For þe synnys þat he had wroght; And, at þe two ?erës ?ende, God almyghty for hym gan sende; For þat day þat þe dede kny?t seyde, Þe touþer knyghte þat same day deyde.

[The Tale of Seint Forsyne's Visit to Hell.] A tale ys tolde of Seynt Forsyne, wharefor he suffryd onys pyne. Þys samë tale tellyþ seynt Bede yn hys gestys þat men rede. whan seynt Fursyne had lyued long, Þyr toke hym þan an euyl strong; Þat tymë þat he wende to deye, Come one to hym and þus gan seye, “Rys vp, Fursyne, and go with me! Merueyl mochë shalt þou see.” wheþer he wulde, or he ne wulde, he toke hym vp, and furþe he shulde; Many stedys he late hym se, Merueylys and grete pryuyte; he shewed hym þe depnes of helle, And þe peynes þat þeryn dwelle; Seþþe þey toke a weye ry?t euene, As hym þoght, toward heuene. yn þe fyrmament as þey ?ede, Foure fyres he sawe of gretë drede; Þes foure fyres wax hygh &amp; hote, And yn-to one, alle foure þey smote. wndurful was þan þat fyre, And dredful, and also brynnyng shere. Þe aungel þydyrward toke þe weye; Þo þoght seynt Fursyne, ‘here shal y deye.’ Þe aungel ?ede furþ ful boldely, But seynt Fursyne durst nat come ny. Þe aungel say he gan abyde, “Come furþe,” he seyd, “and þe nat hyde; Of þys fere ne drede þe noght, But þou with wrong euer toke oght; ?yf þou haue take any þyng with wrong, Þou shalt brenne yn þys fyre strong. with mochë þoght, sorowe, and drede, Fursyne vnto þat fyre ?ede. Þe fyre on boþë half hym was, But furþ he ?ede fast on hys pas, yn þat fyre saghe he lye Saulys brennyng, and ruly crye; Þe fendës ?edë hem among, And fast echone on oþer þrong with brynnyng crokys sorowfuly, And pyned hem with-oute mercy. None lay by hemself a-lone, But eche on oþer, with sorowe and wone. Echone to oþer was sorowe and peyne, with-outyn endë for certeyn. For pynyng, for wepyng, for cryyng, alas, Fursyne almoste confunded was. As he sagh þys sorowe so grym, Come a deuyl rennyng to hym with glesyng y?en and croke yn hande, Þe steme stode oute of hys mouþ brennand: he broght on þat brynnyng croke A brennyng soule þat al to-shoke. Toward Fursyne he ran hys cours, And calyd hym ‘fals, felun, treytours.’ “haue þys soule! þys hast þou slayn! Þou ?eldyst nat hys gode a?eyn. he kast þe soule vpp-on þe prest, And brenned hys o syde, and half hys brest. he went þat tyme haue deydë þore, For the soule brennyd hym so sore; he hopyde neuer to haue come þen, So had þe soule broght hym be-neþen. But at þe last þan gan he crye, And seyd, “mayster, me helpe now, or y dey!” Þan seyde þe aungel to Fursyne: “y tolde þe langer of þys þyne; y sed langer at þe bygynnyng, ?yf þou haddest of oþer mennys þyng Þat þou madest nat of, amendëment, yn þys fyre hyt shulde be brent. loke now, ?yf þou kanst hyt oght knowe, Þe soule þat þe brenned so lowe.” “?e,” seyde Fursyne, “y knowe hyt wele For whom y suffre þys peyne eche dele: Þys he dede, whan he shuld deye, he ?af me a cloþe for hym to preye; For no maystry, ne for noun eyuyl, he ?af it me; but with hys gode wyl. And now, weyl y hyt graunte, Þat y helde hym nat cunnaunt; wyllyng, certys, y dyd hyt noght, But for rechelesshepe of þoght.” Þe aungel þo toke þe soule forlore, And dyd hyt þere hyt was byfore, yn-to þe peyne, þere for to dwelle,— hyt was an okerere, y ?ou telle;— Þan touched Fursynys brest and syde, And þe fyre my?t no lenger abyde. Þurghoute þe fyre he ledde hym euene, And shewed hym of þe blys of heuene: he shewed hym alle þe pryuyte Þere men befalleþ yn flessh to be. he broght hym þan to þe body a?en For to shewe þat hyt was certeyn. Þre days keptë men þe body, Alle for dedë comunly. he lyued seþþen many ?eres, A quyk man, and a feres. But þe brynnyng alle be dene, Euermore aftyrward was hyt sene; As long as he here lyued, Þe brynnyng on hys body cleued. y trowe god shewed þys merueyle, For þou ne shuldest of trowþë fayle. Seþen leuyd he so holyly Þat men callyn hym nowe seynt Fursy; He was fyrst founder and syre Of þe cherche of Knares-myre; And of Norwyche þe modyr cherche he ded hyt fyrst make and werche; And þere he lyþ be-?unde þe see, he ordeyned a mynster for to be; Foure ?ere or þe cherche were ful set was hys soulë to god fet. Okerers men oght to weyue, ?eue hem noght, ne of hem receyue,— ?yf þou wetë what þey are,— yn no manere of chaffare. Sum tyme þer was yn a cyte, Þat ?yf an okerer my?t founde be, Þey helde hym vyler þan a Iew, For no man wuldë hys prew; Men clepyde hys hous yn euery strete ‘Þe hous of þe fendës sete.’ Fyre, watyr, þat he shuld note, Þey cursed hyt euery grote; And euery syde to ouþer, “sere, lo, þere þe cursed vsurere!” yn cherchë no man ?af hym pes, For a fend þey hym ches. No man was so hardy To bryng hym þyng opunly, Þat he ne shulde vyly be shent Of alle þat by þe stretë went. And whan any vsurere was dede, Þe cherchë?erde þey hym forbede. Þey wuld nat, for loue ne awe, ?eue hym crystyn mennys lawe; ‘Requiem’ ne shulde be note be sunge Ne seyd for hym, wyþ mannys tunge. ‘Lux perpetua,’ and he, were wroþe, For yn hys lyue he solde hem boþe. A ny?t, when men hadde here reste, he okered pens yn hys cheste; And also, vpp-on þe day ly?t he gadered gode with alle hys my?t. Þan semyþ hyt weyl yn oure lay Þat he solde boþe þe ny?t and þe day; ‘Requiem,’ (þe reste with outen ende,) Þar-to shal he neuer wende; Ne ‘lux perpetua’—þe endles ly?t— Þer-of shal he neuer haue sy?t; where he ys wurþy, þer shal he be; yn hym nas neuer no charyte. Now of þeft haue we seyd, And þese vsurers made vp-breyde. god ?eue vs gracë þefte to fle, And al okerers wel to amendyd be. [The Eighth Commandment.] Now of þe eytþë wyl we speke, Þat fals sysours vse moste to breke. ‘Þous halt no fals wytnes bere, Þyn euene crystyn for to dere.’ who-so with hys mouþe, one, seys, And with hys herte þenkeþ ouþer weys,— he ys wurþy to be shent, For a doþ a?ens þys comaundment. But many one þat are þus fykyl Synnyn nat ylychë mykyl; Þarfor behoueþ be tolde þe skyl As holy men seyn vs tyl. who-so beleuyþ a wycches sawe, he bereþ wytnes a?ens þe lawe. Swyche wycches are for to weyue, For many men þey wyl dysceyue. Some men wytnessen a lesyng For nonë ouþer wynnyng But for to begyle sum man þer-ynne; ?yf hyt delyte hym, grete ys þat synne. On ouþer manere synnen sum Þat makeþ lesyng þurgh custum To plese þe folk yn rybaudy: Þat y halde no synne dedly, But þey haue þeryn delyte; Þan mow þey synne dedely ful tyte. And sum vsë for curtesye To speke nobly, and ?yt wyl lye, Þey synnë yn þat feyre spekyng ?yf þey haue delyt yn þat lesyng. And some lye oþer more or lesse, To preyse one bettere þan he es; Swyche lesyng ys nat grete folye But þey hyt vsë comunly. And somë lye as þey were wode For men shuld ?yuë hem sum gode, And seyn þat he haþ do so or so Þat he my?t neuer come-to to do. But þogh no man haue þer-of euyl, ?yt hyt ys þe tycement of þe deuyl. No lesyng ys with-outë synne, But þat þer ys algate, sum plyght þerynne; Al aftyr þat þe lesyng ys, Sum ys more, and sum ys les. But some men synnë greuusly yn þys comaundment so hy, Þat of grete þyng fals wytnes beryn, And þar to-also grete oþys sweryn. Swyche synnë greueþ now mekyl, For many one are boþe fals and fykyl; Þat oþer for loue, or for awe, Wyl men swere falsly a sawe, And bere wytnes of swyche a fals To make a man hang be þe hals.nek (O. necke) God haþ sent for swyche veniaunce, But many trusten of long suffraunce. Men hope so moche hys mercy to, Þat some neuer recche what þey do. But þe wys man seyþ yn hys lore, ‘Þat here synne ys moche þe more ?yf þey synne custummably yn þe hope of hys mercy.’ Y shal ?ou tellë how hyt fore Of a man þat hym forswore. [Tale of the Rich Forswearer at a Trial in London.] Yn Londun toune fyl swyche a chek, A ryche man and pore were at cuntek,debate And pleted a-boute a lytyl land Tyl a day was take yn hand; þat day was so ny[e] dreue þat þe othe was to þe ryche man ?yue: wytnes þey allë gan hym bere Þat he ne wuld[ë] falsly swere; For rychë men are holdë trewe, Þogh here falsnes be neuer so newe. whan he was charged þe soþe to seye, Þat he ne shulde, for loue ne eye, Ne for lefë, no for loþe, But trew[ë]ly to swere hys oþe; A-nouþer þan was yn hys þoght, For falshede he wlde haue furþ bro?t; And God toke veniaunce apertly, Þat alle hyt say þat stode hym by. For whan he hadde hys oþë swore, And kest þe boke hem alle before, Vp ne ros he neuer more, But, lay dede befor hem þore. Þan y trowe þat y dar seye Þat he ?ede an euyl weye. By þys tale, ?e mowe se alle Þat fals sweryng wyl euyl befalle, Namlyche, on þe halydom whan he ys charged of any whom. Vndyrstand þys weyl yn þy wyt, Þat god seyþ yn þe holy wryt, ‘Þat fals oþys, ne wrong Iugement, Shul neuer morë be vnshent.’ Se how veniaunce was hys mede whan he hadde of God no drede: Almyghty God, þat ys soþfastnes, hé wulde take to fals wytnes. Fals sweryng ys nat ellys to say, But ‘forsakyng of god, and alle hys lay.’ A man þat swereþ fals swerynges, He forsakeþ fyuë þynges:— Þe ioye of heuene he forsakeþ, whan he, wetyng, fals oþys makeþ, And alle hys blessyd cumpanye Þat þey hym neuer helpe ?yf þat he lye; And Ihesu crystys passyun þat for hym to þe deþ was doun, þat hyt helpe hym neuer at nede, ?yf he swere fals, or falsdom bede. Þe þryddë, ?yf he swerë fals, hys crystendom he forsakþ als, þat hyt helpe hym neuer more ?yf þat he lyë þore. Þe fourþe ys, he forsakeþ þe preyers þat holy wryt wytnes of beres, þat þey neuer stonde hym by ?yf he swere hys oþe falsly. Þe fyueþë þyng wyl hym shende, For he ?yfþe hym self wyþ-oute[n] ende To þe fende þat ys yn helle, ?yf þat he lye, or falsly telle. On þese fyue maners hymself deryþ þat on þe bokë falsly sweryþ. For hys loue þat deyde on þe rode, Forswere ?ow neuer for worldys gode. For ?e wyte weyl, aud haue hyt herde, þat trouþe ys more þan alle þe worlde. ?yt þer ys anoþer sweryng where-þurgh comþ oftë grete cumbryng, Þe whyche ys, an oþe oute of mesure, Þat he shulde haue a mysauenture On wyfë, and on chylde, to falle, And on hys ouþer godys alle, But he holdë at hys myght hys oþe þat he swereþ to alle ryght. Swyche an oþe ys grete doute to swere, For chauncë comþ on many manere. Þou settest þy chylde to mychë rewþe But þou holde þyn oþe to trewþe. A-nouþer oth comþ ?yt yn place, Þer a man swereþ by fallace.

Y pray ?ow alle, boþe lefe and loþe, Þat ?e charge neuer body with oþe Þat ?e suppose wyl be forswore; For, y warne ?ow wel byfore, Þat who-so putteþ hym to swere, Grete chargë for hym shal he bere. ?yf þou madest awhere any vowe To wurschyp God for þy prowe,— ?yf þou dedyst hyt with þy gode wylle, with-outë stresse or ouþer ylle, Þou art holde to ?elde hyt hym Or þy synne ys grete and grym; wytnes of othë and of hote:vowe Yn heuene, allë þyng þey wote. Noþeles, y sey hardly, ?yf þou vowe to do foly,— As a man to bete or slo, Or to take hys gode hym fro; Or ?yf þou vowe yn ?ungþe or elde, And þou mayst nat but wykkedly ?elde,— God wyl nat þou hold yt so þat þou þy vowe yn wykkednes do; God haþ leuer þou þe wyþdrow Þan do euyl dede after foly vow, Bettere ys a foly wrde be wyþdrawe Þan wyþ euyl dede to fulfyl þat sawe. Þurgh goddys wurd yn þe gospel, Þys may be preuyd ry?t wel. [The Bible-story of John the Baptist's Death.] Hyt speketh of seynt Ion baptyst, Þe best chylde borë vndyr Cryst.

Eueyl he vowed, and swore hys oth, Þer-for with hym ys now god wroth. For ouþer mede wuld she haue none, But þe hede of swete seynt Ion; Here modyr bade here askë þys, Þe hede of seynt Ion yn a dyssh.

Y trowe he wulde haue be forswore Ar he hade hys ye forlore. So had hym better, for hys prowe, For to haue broke þat ychë vowe, And with-oute mede haue late here go, Þan for hys vowe a man do slo. ?yt may y preue hyt by ouþer sawe Þat wryte ys yn þe oldë lawe; Yn þe gest of syre Ieptë, Yn þe byble men mow hyt se. [þe Gest of Syre Jepte,—or the Tale of Jephthah and his Daughter.] Ieptë went onys to batayle And preyd God hys powere shuld nat fayle;— “Graunte me, Lorde, þe maystry nowe, And y shal make to þe a vowe, þat þe fyrst þyng þat y mete Befor me homward yn þe strete, Þerof shal y make sacryfyse;” For to sle hyt, was þan þe asyse. whan he had, þurgh goddys vertu, Of þe batayle prys and pru, Homward as syre Ieptë ?ede he þanked god for hys gode dede. hys doghtyr was þe fyrstë þyng þat mette hym and made hym welcomyng; She grette here fadyr fayre with mouþe And made hym all þe ioye þat she couþe. Þan þoght Ieptë on hys vow, And hadde yn herte sorow ynow. To hys doghtyr þan seyd he, “Þou art deseyuyd, and y for þe; Y made my vow to heuene kyng Þat y shuld sle þe fyrstë þyng Þat y mette homwarde fro þe batayle; And my vow y wyl nat fayle.” Hys doghtyr answered myldly, “Fadyr,” she seyde, “y am redy For to take my deþe of þe; But y am glade þat y þe se. But, swetë fadyr, y pray þe Graunte me two moneþes ar y dye, Þat y may wepe my virginite with hem þat noryst be with me.” Here fadyr graunted weyl þarto, And she forsoþë ded ry?t so; She weptë nat for any outrage, But for of here come no lynage; Þat no fruyt of here my?t spryng, Þare-for she madë here wepyng, And for here fadyr had chylder no mo Þat furþer my?t yn kyndë go. But, ry?t át þe moneþes ende, here fadyr dede nat þerof hende, Þat he hys ownë doghtyr slowe For a foly and a wykked vowe. Seynt Austyne seyþ certeynly Þat he synned ry?t dedly; For he auowede, and nedyd naght, And ?yt yn dede wel werse he wroght. Seynt Austyn seyþ so redy wey Þat y to ?ou dar weyl seye ‘?oure wykked vowys shul ?e nat fylle, Ne make no vowe to any ylle, But chaungë hem to better prow, And take penaunce for foly vowe.’ God shelde vs alle wykkedly to swere, And late vs neuer fals wytnes bere, Ne foly vow for to make, lordë, for þy wurschyp sake. [The Ninth Commandment.] The nynþe comaundment yn oure tellyng Ys “coueyt nat þy neghbours þyng,” For to reue hyt hym wykkedly with wrong pleys or ouþer maystry, No with glosyng, no with queyntyse, No wyþ destressë, on noun wyse, No wyþ wykked procurement, To make hym lese hys tenement.

[The Tale of the Hypocritical Monk of the Abbey Tangabaton.] Seynt Gregory seyþ, as y shal sey, hyt was onës an abbey Þe namë hyght ‘tangabaton,’ And munkës þey were echon. Of a munke ?ede þe wurde ful ryue, Þat he was of holy lyue; But for þat he was nat so, So holy as men tolde hym to, Fals preysyng shal wykkedly wende, As hyt ys wurþy, so shal hyt ende. A seknes toke þe munke ful grym As god had purueyd of hym. he was so traueyled, shortly to sey, Þat he wyst weyl þat he shuld dey. whan he wyst þat, he made do calle Boþe one and oþer, hys bryþryn alle, “Byddyþ hem come byfore me here; Þat may hem auayle, y shal hem lere.” Þey come rennyng, boþe lesse and more, And wende haue herd sum holy lore. And when þey werë come echone, To hem he made of sorow hys mone: “hyt may no lenger be forholne; Falsly, wurschyp haue y stolne; y am nat, breþren, as ?e wene, Of holy lyfe, as haþ be sene; Þat y fasted when ?e lete; For twyys pryuyly y ?ete; And whan ?e wende y had be holy, Y ete and drank ful lustyly.

Ypocrysye, þys ys þe synne Feyre wyþ-oute, and foule with-ynne.

And of þese berded buckys also, with hem-self þey moche mysdo, Þat leuë crystyn mennys acyse And hauntë alle þe newë gyse; Þerwhylys þey had þat gyse on hand, was neuer gracë yn þys land. Of proud wymmen wuld y telle, But þey are so wroth and felle; Of þese þat are so foule and fade, Þat make hem feyrere þan god hem made with oblaunchere or ouþer floure, To make hem whytter of coloure. Grete pryde hyt ys, and outrage, þat she ys nat payd of goddys ymage. heuedys tyfed wyþ grete pryde, with heer, and hornës syde,long Men mow wete hyt ys grete synne To hauë mochë pryde þer-ynne. Men sey, and haue seyd, here before, For swych pryde are wymmen forlore.— Ryche ladyys of grete renouns,name Þey do make hem ryche corouns,hauyng Þey may make to here auenaunt, But ouer mesure ys nat cunnaunt. Of ladyys wulde y leue my sawe, But y dar nat for goddys awe;drede Of hem behoueþ to sey sumdeyl, yn what poyntës þey do nat wel. God haþ shewed, and sheweþ euery day, Þat swychë pryde ys noght to pay. A tale y shal þerforë telle, How a lady was pyned yn helle. [The Tale of the Proud Lady, who was burnt to ashes again and again in Hell by a Burning Wheel.] þer was a lady, a lordys wyfe, here fayrhede was yn renoun ryfe; Moche she loued feyre tyfyng, On here hede, ouer al þyng, For to be holde þe feyryst lady Of al þo þat woned here by; And whan she wened best to haue lyuyd, Þe deþ here toke; here dayys were fyllyd; For when men wene to lyfe haue space, Þan ys deþ sunnest yn place. Whan she was dede, sone aftyrward here squyer toke a syknes hard, Þat here lorde helde of grete prys, For he was a man yn seruyse wys. As he lay yn hys bed a ny?t, hym þoght hys lady come to hym ry?t, And seyd þus, “rys, and go wyþ me, A merueyle shal y shewe to þe.” Þys ychë man graunted here noght, For hyt ran weyl hym yn þoght Þat shé was dede and leyd yn graue, Þat hym of hys beddë wulde haue. But wheþer he wulde or noght, wyþ wel &amp; wo, She had hym vp with here to go. Þus tolde he seþyn with moche drede; A?ens hys wylle with here he ?ede; She ledde hym to a mochë felde, So grete one neuer he behelde. Þan stodë styl, þys lady, And he by here ful dredfully. As þey hadd stondë but a þrowe, Come furþ deuylys þat fast gun blowe; With hem þey broght a brennyng wheyl, Þat on here hede was set eche deyl. Þys whel þat was set on here heuede, Brende here alle, þat noght was leued. Efte she ros, when she was brent, And had þe samë turment, And brende ry?t as she dede before; To se þat peyne hys herte was sore. ?yt she ros þe samë wey; For saule may neuer for peynë deye. And efte þey set hyt on here krowne, And brende here al to asshen doune; And euermore she leuyd a?en, For peynë my?t she neuer be sleyn. Þan askede he here, why þat hyt was Þat she suffred swyche peyne. “alas, alas,” She seyd, “y suffre þys mys-auenture For on my heuede ouer feyre tyfure; For when y shuld agher go or ryde, y dyghte my heuede ry?t moche with pryde For to be presyd ouer alle ladyys, And of prydë to bere þe prys, And among kny?tës yn halle y wulde be holde feyrest of alle. þer-for þys ychë peyne y dryghsuffre For y bare me yn pryde so hygh. But warne my lordë, y pray þe, hys pryde and bobaunce þat he late be; But ?yf he do, he shal be forlore, Þat y warne hym weyl before; For on one of þys dayys shul ?e deye, My lorde and þou: þe soþe y seye.” Ryght at þe termë, as she seyde, Þe kny?t, and þat squyer, deyde. By þat tokenyng wel men knew Þat þe tale was ry?t and trew. Þerfor hyt ys gretë doute, wymmen to tyfe here hedys aboute. ?yf god haue lent þe handys and fete, Armës, leggës, feyre and swete,— Be nat ouer proude of þys, Þey are nat þyne, but þey ben hys; For ?yf he wylle, he may hem þe reue; with-oute hys leue, shal none beleue. Despyse noun ouþer þat so haue noght, Ne þoght þey be nat so feyre y-wroght; For ?yf þou doust, þou mayst hem tyne,lese And for þat prydë go to pyne. Ne dysgyse nat þy cloþyng Ouer mesure, for þy preysyng. Alas! hyt shuldë so betyde, Many one are lost for here pryde. Shal grace come neuer yn þat land Þere men haue swychë gyse yn hand; God and grace are wyþ hem wroth, Þat haue, for pryde, dysgysed here cloth. Noþeles euery man may, Aftyr hys astate, make hym gay; But when he þasseþ ouer mesure, Þerof cumþ mysauenture. Gentyl men ofte, for swyche desert Fal at þe laste yn grete pouert. A weddyd wyfe may atyre here Þat here husbunde loue noun but here; For hys loue she may hyt do, But for none ouþer mannys so. ?yt swyche y rede, þat þey so fare Þat here pryde make hem nat bare. Gretly þey synne yn þer queyntyse Þat nouelrye al day areyse, For to be preysed and of grete syght, Al day dysgyse hem at here myght; Forsoþe hyt semeþ weyl to be Al here lyfe yn vanyte. But wlde þey þenke þat make swyche strut, yn what robe, yn erþe, þey shul be put, Þey shulde nat make hyt so a-mys, ?yf þey þoght oft of þys. Y shal ?ou telle a lytyl wyght How hyt befyl onys of a kny?t. [The Tale of the Knight and Monk who lovd new Fashions.] Þer was a kny?t þat loued nouelrye, As many one haunte now þat folye; he dede to make, yn þe somers tyde, A kote perced queyntly with pryde; And God was nat þer-of payd, For yn hys pryde he was betrayd. Þys kny?t ?ede, vpp-on a day, Aboute roberye, to gete hys pray; Homward as he hys pray ledde with hys enmys he was bestedde; with fors þey gun with hym fyght, And slogh þere þys ychë kny?t. Þe kny?tys frendys herdë seye how he was slayn by þe weye; Ful feyre þan gun þey for hym werche, Þey byryed þe body feyre at þe cherche; hys frendys departed hys katel Among þe pore men, and þat was wel. whan þey come at þe kote gysyng, To dele hyt among hys ouþer þyng, Before þe pore men hyt was broght; Þe pore men seyd þey wulde hyt no?t. A clerk stodë þo þere be syde, And, prayd for þe kote of pryde. To werne hyt hym, þey þoght loþe; Þey toke and ?aue þys clerk þe cloþe. Þys clerk was glad whan he hyt hadde; Þys kote asswyþe on hym he cladde. Se now here a grete myschaunce Come ry?t as for veniaunce: Ry?t as he was yn þe kote al dyght, A fyre brennyng on hym gan lyght, And brend hys body dounne to þe grounde whylys oght of hym my?t be founde. Þer shewed God weyl by þat kas Þat þe kote a-cursed was, And tokened wel sorowe and wrake, Þat nonë pore man wulde hyt take For prydë of þe newë gyse A?ens crystyn mennys wyse; But þe clerk was wode al gate To were a cloþe a?ens hys state. here mow ?e se þat god ys wroth with hem þat dysgyse here cloþe. And a clerk ys moche for to blame Þat bryngyþ hym self yn foule fame, Clerk ordeyned yn dignyte Þat haunteþ swyche Iolyte; Noþeles, of þe newë gyse Þe deuyl haþ made hymself chefe iustyse; And ?yf he yn folye begynne to stoute, Þan bereþ he þe deuylys baner aboute; Mochë folk ys þerwyþ blent; God do þerof amendment. ?yf þou hauë grete desyre To be clepyd lorde or syre, For to glosë þe, and slyppe, And to haue þe wurdys of wurschyp; Or ?e wymmen also, comunly, wulde be kallede ‘madame’ or ‘lady;’ Al þys comþ of gretë pryde; yn þy shryfte þou noght hyt hyde. he ys ry?t lorde, þe kyng of heuene; wrong hyt ys þat men any oþer neuene. ?yf þou delyte þe yn grete meyne, For men shulde hauë drede of þe, And for þy meynë wuldyst preysed be, ?yf harme to oþer þan do þat meyne, Þou for þy meynë shalt dampned be ?yf þou to euyl vowe þy meynë. ?yf þou delyte þe yn grete hallys, Yn a foule prydë þan þou fallys; For y se many þat nowe þey bygge, And now sonë, dede þey lygge. y sey for þo þat haue grete pryde yn hygh hallys and yn wyde. ?yf þou delyte þe yn ryche beddyng, yn hors, yn harneys, or yn feyre rydyng, Alle ys pryde and vanyte; Of al shalt þou a-couped be. Y seyd langere, yn gode cunnaunt, Euery man may haue to hys auenaunt, Cytes, tounnes, castellys, and hallys, hors, armour, and þat þar to fallys; But, yn al þat mochë þrong, Do holy cherche, ne pore man, wrong. what sey ?e men of ladyys pryde Þat gonë traylyng ouer syde: ?yf a lady were ryghtly shreue, Better hyt were yn almës ?eue; To soulë helpe hyt my?t do bote, Þat trayleþ lowe vndyr þe fote. wymples, kerchyues, saffrund betyde; ?elugh vnder ?elugh þey hyde; Þan wete men neuer, wheþer ys wheþer, þe ?elugh wymple or þe leþer.skyn wymmen þat go fro strete to strete, One or ouþer for to mete, Of prydë comþ swychë desyre, For þey haue on hem feyre atyre: But she wul to þe prest þat telle, She may þerforë go to helle; For yn as moche þat she douþ men synne, yn so moche shal she haue plyght ynne. And, wymmen, y seye of þo Þat borwe cloþes yn carol to go; Þat porë prydë, god hyt loþes, Þat make hem proude of ouþer mennys cloþys. ?yf þou hast spokë wurdys of pryde, And lettyst ouþer men any tyde Of here bedys and of here fastyng, Or of any ouþer holy þyng, Or of any ouþer godë dede, to telle hyt þe prest, behoueþ þe nede. ?yf þou euer lettë began Þat was wurshep to god or man, As yn cherche to synge or rede, Or of sum oþer holy dede; Or also for boste or for pryde, with prest or with clerk to chyde, Þurgh þat pryde þou fallyst yn synne, And cursednes þerwith to wynne. Also þat clerk ys moche to blame Þat letteþ to shaue hys krowne for shame; Y rede þat he yn tyme hyt shaue, For he wote neuer what nede he shal þerto haue. ?yf þou yn ernest, or yn game, yn scornë blessedyst Goddys name; Or ?yf þou were so wundyrly proude Þat þou mysseydyst God al aloude, For any chaunce þat may betyde Skorne nat God, ne wyþ hym chyde: Morë pryde, no morë synne, Þan skornë god, mayst þou falle ynne. ?yf þou grucchedest, and seydyst noght, But to God haddyst euyl þoght, wete þou wel, hyt ys grete pryde, Grucchyng with God, or for to chyde. ?yf a man haue mysdo or seyde, And men hym blame for þat mysbreyde, ?yf he susteynë hys mysdede, And hys mysawe wyl nat drede, Þat cumþ of mysprout herte and hy Þat wyl nat knowe hys owne foly. Of al folyys þat beryn name, Þys foly ys moste for to blame; who-so-euer to þys ys custummable, hys amendment may neuer be stable. what sey men of þese loseniours Þat haue here wurdys feyre as flours? Now ys þe flourë whyte and rede, And now hyt ys boþe drye and dede. Þe losenioure spekþ now þy pay, And behynde þy bak hyt ys away. þere one haþ smylyng semelaunt And behetyþ þe to holde cunnaunt, kepe þe þan fro losengrye, For feyre spekyng man kan weyl lye. who-so-euer ys custummable to banne For prydë, sum tymë or whanne, Þe apostyl seyþ þat he may noght Vn-to þe blysse of heuene be broght. A-noþer spyce hyt ys of pryde, who so haunteþ for to chyde. For holy cherche forbedeþ þe To chyde wyþ any of þy meynë. Teche hym ferst, yn feyre manere; And ?yf he wyl nat with feyre lere, Þan mayst þou speke stoutly to hym, with-outë wraþþe, wurdys ful grym, Þat he be chasted at þy fre wylle, But þat þou bere yn herte none ylle.

And þat may weyl preuyd be with a tale of an autoryte, Þat mochë peynë shal he bere wyþ-outë ende, þe bakbytere; And y shal tellë ?ou a lyte Of one þat coude hys felaus byte. [The Tale of the backbiting English Monk.] þer was a man of relygyun, þat yn þys he was a felun, Yn bakbytyng, as ?e han herde, As many one are now yn þys werlde. He was wunt to seye wykked sawes Behynde þe bak of hys felaws; For he wulde be holde þe beste Of all hys breþer, and þe wylyeste. A syknes toke þys munke, and deyde, As God had of hym purueyde, And went yn-to peynë hard, As was shewed aftyrward. Befel þe tyme, as hyt ys ry?t, Munkës to rysë at mydny?t; And when matynes were al done, Þe couent ?ede to beddë sone.

Þe toþer kny?t perseyued hym wel, And drogh hym to hys best castel. Þo was he beseged so streytly, Þat he durst come oute on no party Of alle þe twelue monþe with no deseyt, So was he beseged streyte; Messe ne matyns he ne herde Ne nagher to þe cherge he ferde;?ede And hyt was yn þe lentyn tyde, when men shuld leuë wraþ &amp; pryde. Þan fyl hyt on þe gode fryday, Þe kny?t þat yn þe castel lay loked oute, and say men go To þe cherchë, to and fro; Barfote to þe cherche þey ?ede, To aske mercy for here mysdede. “Ey,” þoght þe kny?t, “long ys gone, Þat messe at þe cherchë herd y none. what so euer God wyl for me werche, y wyl ryse, and go to þe cherche.” He drogh of hys hosyn and hys shone, And ded þe ?atys be on-done. Barfote his ?ede, as ys þe acyse, To cherche, for to herë Goddys seruyse. And as he þe wey to þe cherchë name, Þe chylde, hys enmye, a?ens hym came, And seyd, “treytur, now shalt þou deye, And my fadyr deþ ful dere a-beye; No wurldës gode ne shal þe saue, Þat þou þe deþ of me shalt haue.” Þe kny?t say nonë ouþer bote, But fel on knees byfore hys fote, And seyd, “haue on me mercy For hym þat ly?t yn þe vyrgyne mary, And suffred deþ on þe rodë tre Þys day, to saue boþe þe and me, And for?aue hem þat hys blode spylte; Ryght so for?yue þou me my gylte; y am as a presun here yn þys place, y putte me now alle yn þy grace; Þat goddys grace be on þe lent At þe day of Iugëment!” Þys chylde, þat was hys enmye, herde hym prey so rufully, And seyd, “syn þou hast me besoght For Ihesu loue þat dere vs boght, And for hys modyr loue so dere, For hem y graunte þe my pes here.” Þys ychë chylde down swyþe alyghte, And yn gode louë kest þe kny?t; “Now are we frendys, þat ere were wroþe, Go we nowe to þe cherchë boþe, yn gode loue, and parfyte charyte, For hys sake þat ordeyned pes to be.” Þe kny?t was glad, and no ferly,wndyr And so were al þat cumpanye, Þat he for?aue hym hys mysdede, And to þe cherchë boþe þey ?ede.

[The Tale of the Bear which kept the Hermit's Sheep, and how it was slain by envious Monks.] Þer were twey men of holy wyl Þat leuyd to-gedyr, with-outen yl, A-lonë yn an ermytage, And, as meke as bryd yn kage; Þe toon, men calle Eutycyus, Þe touþer hyght Florentyus. A gode clerk was þe toon, he turned to þe feyþ many on. Eutycyus was þe clerk Þat taght þe folk of goddys werk. Florens was nat so moche yn lore, Yn preyours he was euermore. þer besyde was an abbey, And yn here tyme þe abbot gan deye; whan þys ychë abbot was dede, Alle þe munkës toke hem to rede, And chese hem syre Eutycyus To be abbot of here hous. On alle manere fyl so here lot, Eutycyus þey made here abbot. Aftyr Eutycyus, Florens gan dwelle And woned a-lonë yn hys celle. Florens madë gretë mone For þat he shuld dwel alone; And had grete sorowe, and was drery, As many be þat lese gode cumpany. On a day, he bad hys orysun, And was yn grete afflyccyon, And preyd God he wulde hym ?eue Sum gode cumforte with-al to leue. Þus preyd Florens yn hys bede Þat Gode shuld sende hym sum felaurede. whan he ros vp of his orysown, he ?ede yn hys celle vp and down, And opened hys ?ate, and loked oute, And sagh a berë wylde and stoute. Þys ychë bere come to þe gate To Florens þat stode yn þe ?ate; But when þe bere come at hym nere, Þe bere to hym loutede, and made feyre chere,— Feyre chere as a bere myght make,— And was so meke þat he my?t hym take. þys ychë Florens hym beþoght þat God hadde herd þat he besoght, And þanked hym of hys swete grace, þat he hym sent hadde swyche solace. For a myracle, ?e may hyt vndyrstande, þat a wyldë bere was tame to hande. Þys godë man hadde syxë shepe, And noun hyrde hem for to kepe; He badde þe bere þat he shulde go And dryue hys shepë to and fro, And kepe hem weyl þat noun hem dere, “And þou shalt be my godë bere.” Þe bere hym louted with semblant glad, For to do as Florens hym badde; To þe bere, he seyde hys auys, “Euery day whan y ete twyys, Come þou home at hygh vndurne, And no lenger yn þe felde soiurne; And euery day, when y faste, Come at þe noun, home, at þe laste.” So dyd þe bere, euery day, One oure passed hym neuer away Þat he ne come home, þe yche cele,godly And boþe tymeus he knew hem wele. Þys Florens hadde cumforte and game At hys bere, þat hyt was so tame, And loued hyt moche with-oute fayle For þe myracle and þe grete meruayle: For soþë so hym byrde,moste For he was a merueylus hyrde. A bere þurgh kynde shulde etë shepe; And here as an hyrde he ?afe to hem kepe. Þyt yche merueyle my?t nat be hyd, But yn alle þe cuntre hyt was weyl kyde Þat Florens had a tamë bere, And was an hyrdë, shepe to were.kepe Þe abbot þat hyghte Eutycyus Had foure dyscyplys ful enuyus, Þat alle day of þys berë spakk with grete enuye, gretely to lakk; And seyd, alle fourë hem betwene wyþ grete enuyë, scorne, and tene, “More merueyl doþe Florencyus Þan doþe oure mayster Eutycyus.” Þey seydë “hyt shal nat so go;” And made forward, þat bere to slo. As þey seyd, þey dyd þat woghte; Þe whychë dede ful soure þey boghte. At þe tyme, þe bere, o day come noghte; Florens had þer-of grete þoghte; He ros and ?ede yn-to þe felde, And aftyr hys berë faste behelde. At þe laste, hys bere he fonde, Besyde hys shepe, slayn on a londe. Asswyþë hym self gan to rede who hadde do þat ychë dede; ?yt pleyned he more þe myschaunce Þat þer shulde falle on hem veniaunce, Þan he pleyned hys ownë dere Þat þey had slayn his godë bere. Noþeles he pleyned wundyrly sore Þat hys solas shulde be no more. Eutycyus þe abbot, his felawe, herd sey hys bere was do adawe; And come to hym on hys dysport, To makë Florens gode cumfort. Florens seyd Eutycyus vn-to, “Yn God truly y tryst so, Þat veniaunce shal on hem take Yn þys lyfë for my sake. Of Ihesu Cryst þey hade no drede, To sle þat hylpe me yn my nede, Felunlyche, as for enuye, And he ded no man folye; He was me sent, þurgh Goddys grace, To be myn helpe and my solace; Þat God wuldë hym me ?eue, why wuld þey nat suffre hym lyue? God almy?ty shal do hys wyl wyþ hem, and mo, þat do so yl.” As he seyde, so gan hyt falle; Gode toke veniaunce on hem alle; Meseles þey waxë þan to pyne, Here lemes roted before here yne; Aboue þe erþe þey were stynkyng, Þat to þe beres deþ were consentyng. Þarfore þe pope seynt Gregory Tellyþ þys talë, resun why, Þat enuye ys a cursed synne, Any man to falle þer-ynne. Moche are they wurþy to suffre shame, Þat for enuye brynge a man yn blame, Or make hym lese hys wurldly aght,gode Or frendys also to be vnsaght. who-so þat doþ, he may hym drede, No þyng but peyne shal be hys mede. Syn þys wurldë fryst bygan, Enuye haþ be euer yn man; Lucyfer had fyrst enuye, Þat man was made to state so hye; Yn paradys he made hym falle, And seþen of hys ofspryng alle; So that enuye haþ reyned ay Yn alle mankynde vnto þys day; And, Englys men namëly Are þurgh kynde of hertë hy: A forbyseyn ys toldë þys, Seyd on Frenshe men and on Englys, ‘Þat Frenshe men synne yn lecherye, And Englys men yn enuye.’ lecherye ys flesshly synne; Enuye cumþ of þe soule wyþ-ynne; lechery ys þe lesse, we fynde, And enuye ys þe more vnkynde; For y se noun yn hys lyue Þat of enuye kan hym shryue; Þogh euery day a man hyt haunte, ?yt wyl no man be hyt a-graunte. Telle to any þat he haþ enuye, He seyþ a?en “hyt ys a lye.” how mow þéy þan shryue þat synne, Þat seyn þey haue no gylt þerynne? we Englys men þeron shulde þynke, Þat enuyë vs nat blynk.

Þe wys kyng Salamon Seyþ þese wurdys to men echon:— “hys lyppes,” he seyþ, “he shal make swete, wyþ feyrë wurdys he shal þe grete, But yn hys hertë he shal þynke For to do þe a wykked blynke.” So ded þe traytur, fals Iudas, Þat dampned ys wyþ Satanas, whan þys Iudas, foule felun, weytede Ihesu with tresun. Fyrst he grete hym and gan lagh, And syþen he kest hym þat alle men sagh, And yn hys herte was tresun bolde, For to þe Iewës he had hym solde. ‘Treytur! recorde what þou hast herde Seyde and sunge yn al þe werlde.’ Vndyr heuene ne ys so moche tresun As yn feyre wurd of hert felun. Þarfor, treytur, y tolde þe er, Þy wonyng ys wyþ Lucyfer.

Alle þese coude hem neuer werekepe From treytur ne fro bakbytere.

Ful slogh he ys þat wyl nat lere Þat yche framë blessed preyere; And also he ys ful of slownes Þat may, and wyl nat, here hys messe, Specyaly on þe Sunday he trespasyþ more yn þe lay. yn þe woke, o day, þurgh ryght, Þe Sunday, ys a day of my?t. how sey þese men þat are þus slogh, Þat oute of mesure slepe a throwe? whan he heryþ a bel ryng, To holy cherchë men kallyng, Þan may he nat hys beddë lete But þan behoueþ hym to lygge and swete, And take þe mery mornyng slepe; Of matynes ryche men take no kepe ?yf þe mowe ryse at tyme of messe. For þe matynes, noþer more ne lesse Þan ys þys Terlyncels skylle, ‘Slepe þou long, and y shal hele.’ he putteþ heuenys yn hys y?e, And makeþ hym lenger for to lye; And seyþ “al betyme mayst þou ryse, whan þey do þe messe seruyse; A messe ys ynogh for þe; Þe touþer gyblot, late hyt be; here mayst þou bettyr slepe a throwe þan sytte and loke vpp-on a wowe.” Þys ys þe cunsel of Terlyncel; yn alle sloghnesse he bereþ þe bel; he ys a deuyl of þat myster, To sloghnes he ys cunseler. þan cumþ one aboutë pryme “Rys up,” he seyþ, “now ys tyme.” Þan begynneþ he to klawe and to raske, And ?yueþ Terlyncel hys taske. he klawyþ, he shrubbyþ, wel at hys pay, And makyþ to Terlyncel a lay; To hym þat kalled, he spekeþ stoutly, “what deuyl! why haþ þe prest swych hy? Byd hym þat he abyde algate; Hym dar nat syng ?yt ouer late.” For hym shal so Goddys seruyse abyde Tyl hyt be passed ouer þe tyde. ?yt perauenture, at hys rysyng, Of God spekeþ he no þyng, But ?yf hyt be of sum vanyte Þat rennyþ yn hys þoght; þat spekeþ he. And when he cumþ vnto þe messe, Þere behoueþ hym hys here dresse; Ful fewe bedys are yn hys mouþe, He vsyþ none; þey are vncouthe. And ?yf a frere cum for to preche, Of a dyner were bettyr speche; Þan seyþ he, “God shal alle saue; Do wel; wel shalt þou haue.” Certys þat ys nat ynow, For he doþ no þyng to prow. But ?yf he wulde lestene þe frere, To do weyl þan my?t he lere. ?yf hyt be nat þan redy, hys dyner, Take furþe þe chesse or þe tabler; So shal he pley tyl hyt be none, And Goddys seruyse be al done. Alas, wykkédly he dyspendyþ Alle þe lyfe þat God hym sendyth! Aftyr þe none, þan shal he do As he dede before none so. Swyche a lyfe þan shal he lede, Noght þat he shal haue to mede; yn alle hys lyfe shal he [nat] fynde Oght þat may hym of pyne vnbynde; No more he halt to God cunnaunt, But weyl more to Termagaunt; He ys no morë crystyn man Þan who so kallyþ a blak oxe ‘swan.’ y dar weyl seye to hygh and logh, yn Goddys seruyse are swych men slogh. Swych synne men kalle ‘accyde,’ yn Goddës seruyse slogh betyde. lord! what shal swych men seye yn þat poynt when þey shul deye? yn alle here lyfe ne roght þey noght Of hym þat hem ful derë boght.

Hyt ys no wundyr þogh þey haue noun, Þey wyl nat graunte þey haue mysdoun, Yn here lyfe, whyle þey haue myght; And þan shal God ?elde alle with ryght. Ful slogh þey were when þey shuld wyrk; Yn tyme of traueyle were þey yrk;[slow] Þéy þoght nat of þat men spelle, Þat God seyþ yn þe gospelle: “Beþ wakyng,” he seyþ, to men alle; “what tymë þat ?oure lorde wyl kalle, For þat tyme þat ?e lestë wene He wul ?ow kalle; loke ?e be clene; For ?yf ?e slepe at hys kallyng ?e shul nat come yn at þe weddyng.” Þys yche lorde kalleþ vs euery day, wyþ þe prechour, alle þat he may. ?e are slogh, and lyen to slepe, whan ?e a?ens þe prechur þrepe; ?e mow nat come yn to þe weddyng,— Heuene blys ys þe menyng;— For ?e slepe yn wykked wyl, And wyl nat shryue ?ow of ?oure yl. ?e wenë þat God shal ?ow ?eue, Yn wykkednes, long to leue; And ?e here seyë þat sum whyle, Yn swychë hope goþ mochë gyle. A lytyl tale y shal ?ow vndo Of a man þat hoped so, As tellyþ þe holy man, seynt Bede, Yn gestys of Ingland þat men rede. [The Tale of the English Squire who put off his Repentance till too late.] Þyr was a kyng, ‘Conred’ he hyght, Atale. Þe Mercë was hys kyngdom ry?t; þe Merce hyght þan, as y herd seye, Þat men kalle now Lyndëseye. Þys Conred had a seriaunt, A wys man, and of body vaylaunt; yn armys was a doghty squyere, yn alle þe lande ne was hys pere. Of a vyce, he hadde sum deyl, Þat no man myght trowe him weyl; where þat he myght make a wanlace, And any þyng to þe kyng purchace, He ne lette for no fals oth, Ne for wraþþe of lefe ne loth, Þat he ne made ofte dysheresun, And holy cherche traueylede with tresun. For wrong ne lefte he ny?t ne day, But onely he serued þe kyng to pay; He ne ?af tale of shame ne synne, But þat onely he myght rycchesse wynne. Þyr fyl on hym a syknes so stronge Þat he lay yn hys beddë long. Sone aftyr betydde a lyte Þe kyng come, hym to vysyte, And bad hym be of répentaunce, And shryue hys synne for allë chaunce; “Forsake now,” he seyde, “alle þy mysdede, And y shal fynde þe at þy nede.” He seyde, “so shall y aftyrwarde; ?yf y may skape þys euyl harde, Þan shal y do oueral ryght, And ?eue me al to God almyght; But ?yt wyl y do hyt yn respyte Tyl y be of þys euyl alle quyte; Y wul nat be founde so vyl Þat myn herte were yn swyche peryl To repente me for a lytyl syknes, But ?yf y were yn harder stres. ?yf y, for dredë, aske a preste, Þat shame shulde al day be me neste Þat y were a-ferd of þe ded. Y wyl nat ?yt do at þy rede; But lefë syre, latyþ me lye; Alle þat ?e seye, me þynkeþ folye.” Þe kyng lettyd þarforë no?t; To leue hys synne, efte he hym besoght, For he helde hym of gretë prys For þat he was boþe doghty and wys. And þys ys a custummable þyng Now, wyþ euëry lordyng, Þat, ?yf his stuwarde hym oght wynne, Be hyt wyþ ryght, or wyþ synne, Hym wyl he holdë most pryue Of allë þo þat wyþ hym be. But as he takeþ þerof þe frame, He shal haue parte of synne and shame. þe kyng come eft to þe seriaunt, And bad hym to be répentaunt, And þenk on hys saluacyun, And shryue hys synne þat he had doun. “Syre,” he seyd, “þys ys my chaunce, Hyt ys noght my répentaunce; For, langér as y here lay, Ry?t at þe oure of mydday, Twey ?unge men come hedyr to me, Þe feyrest þat any man myght se; Me þoght, ry?t whan y sagh þo, Þat y felt no þyng of wo. Byfore my bedde þey stode a þrowe, And behelde me as they shuld me knowe; when þey had stonde a lytyl tyde, Þey set hem doune on my bedde syde. when þey set were, furþ þey toke And shewed a lytyl feyrë boke, And bad me þat y shuld hyt rede, For alle hyt was myn ownë dede; And y þat neuer on bokë couþe, Alle y hyt red with opun mouþe; Alle þe gode dedys þat euer y wroght, Alle were þere before me broght, Þe lestë þoght þat y coulde þynke, Þat of godenesse hadde any blynke, Alle y sagh hyt before me, For lytyl was hyt vnto se; For lessë my?t neuer haue bene ?yf any man hyt shulde haue sene. “when y hadde reddeþat y myght rede, Þey shette here boke, and furþ þey ?ede.

But whan y sagh no better bote, Y lay stylle boþe hand and fote; whan þey had traueyled me so with yl, A stoundë sate þey by me styl And drogh furþ a mochë boke,— Þe most þat y euer on gan loke: So grete hyt was and so orryble, þer-yn was more þan yn a byble;— For alle þat y haue do wyþ synne, Euery dele ys wryte þerynne, And euery wurde with sorow and pyne Þey made me redë, maugre myne; Þe lestë wurde þat euer y þoght, Þat vnto synne a-mountede oght, was yn þat boke ful þykly dreuyn, was none for?etyn ne for?euyn; And alle y redde, boþe lesse and more; Þat was þe pyne þat pyned me sore. whan hyt was redd euerydeyl, Þe boke was shet, and leyd vp weyl.

Twey brennyng knyuys þey oute drogh, And seyd, “Do we oure dedë nowe; Do we swyþe, and noght we dwelle, And hast we vs wyþ hym to helle.” Þe toon þurgh myn hedë smote wyþ þe knyfe þat was so hote; Þe toþer smote me yn-to þe fete Þat almost to-gedyr þe strokës mete; But whan þey are to gedyr y-come, And haue my herte betwyxe hem nome, Þan shal y dey, and hennë wende with þese to helle with-outyn ende. wharto shuld y þan me repente whan y wote my Iugëment?

And alle ys þys for sloghþehede, whan man betyme wyl haue no drede; Þarefore seyþ þe kyng Salamon “Beþ nat ydul, neuer none,” For ?oure gode dedys, ?e shul hem fynde, Oute of pyne þey wyl ?ow vnbynde. he þat ys slogh yn euery gode dede, what shal helpe whan he haþ nede? Þe holy man spekþ of a synne Of sloghnes, þat men falle ynne; ?yf þat any shuld oght weyl do, hym loþyþ so gretly þarto Þat he fondyþ on allë wyse To do hyt on þe werst asyse. ?yf he of Godys wurde oght here, Þerof hym þynkeþ an hundred ?ere; But ?yf he be at any pleyyng At þe ale house, or at any ouþer ianglyng For to rage wyþ ylka fyle,maydgerle Þer þenkeþ hym but lytyl whyle. yn goddys seruyse are swyche men yrk;slow when þey come vn-to þe kyrke To here matynys or messë song, hem þenkeþ hyt lastyþ ouer long; Þan shal he iangle, or telle a tale, Or wyte where þey shul haue þe beste ale. Swyche synne ys kalled ‘accyde,’ yn gode dede to be slogh, or long abyde. ?yf any man be coupable yn þys, yn swyche poyntys þat he haue do mys, Be he hygh or be he logh, He ys yn Goddys seruyse slogh.

Yn foly ys allë þat þey gete, here cloth, here drynkë, and here mete. And, for swych þyng, telle y shal, what byfyl onys of a mynstral: Seynt Gregorye telleþ yn hys spell how hyt of a mynstral fell. [The Tale of the Minstrel who was kild for disturbing a Bishop.] A mynstralle, a gulardous, Come onys to a bysshopes hous And asked þere þe charyte; Þe porter lete hym haue entre; At tyme of mete, þe bourde was leyd, And þe benesun shuld be seyd; Þys mynstral made hys melody with gretë noyse, and loude, and hy. Of þe bysshope, þe famë ran Þat he was an holy man; Þe bysshope sette hym at þe bourde, And shuld haue blessed hyt with wurde; So was he sturbled with þe mynstral, Þat he hadde no grace to sey with-alle His graces ryght deuoutëly For þe noyse of þe mynstralsy. Þe bysshope pleyned hym ful sore, And seyd to allë þat were þore, Þat he ne shulde make hys nycete Before the graces of þe charyte. He sagh hyt weyl, þurgh þe spryt, Þat þer shuld come veniaunce astyt. “?yueþ hym þe charyte, &amp; latyþ hym go; Hys deþ ys nygh, þat shal hym slo.” He toke charyte, and toke hys gate; And as he passed out at þe ?ate, A stonë fyl down of þe wal, And slogh þerë þe mynstral. Þat betokened þat God was noght Payd of þat þe mynstral wroght, Þat he desturbled þe benesoun And þe gode mannys deuocyoun. Þys tolde y for þe glemennes sake, To loke whan þey here gle shuld make; And also for þo þat shuld hyt here, Þat þey loue hyt nat so dere, Ne haue þerynne so grete lykyng, Þe lesse to wurschyp heuene kyng. [A Tale of Bishop St. Robert Grostest of Lincoln, and why he lovd Music.] Y shall ?ow telle, as y haue herd, Of þe bysshope Seynt Roberd; Hys tonamë ys ‘Grostest Of Lynkolne,’ so seyþ þe gest. he loued moche to here þe harpe, For mannys wytte hyt makyþ sharpe; Next hys chaumbre, besyde hys stody, Hys harpers chaumbre was fast þerby. Many tymes, be ny?tys and dayys, He had solace of notes and layys. One asked hym onys, resun why he hadde delyte yn mynstralsy: he answerede hym on þys manere, why he helde þe harper so dere, “Þe vertu of þe harpe, þurgh skylle &amp; ry?t, wyl destroye þe fendës my?t, And to þe croys by godë skylle Ys þe harpë lykened weyle. Anoþer poynt cumfórteþ me, Þat God haþ sent vnto a tre So mochë ioye to here with eere; Moche þan morë ioye ys þere with God hym-selfë, þere he wonys; Þe harpe þerof me oftë mones; Of þe ioye and of þe blys where God hym-self wonys and ys. Þare-for, gode men, ?e shul lere, whan ?e any glemen here, To wurschep God at ?oure powere, As Dauyd seyþ yn þe sautere, “yn harpe, yn thabour, and symphan gle, wurschepe God, yn troumpes, and sautre, yn cordys, an organes, and bellys ryngyng, yn al þese, wurschepe ?e heuene kyng.” ?yf ?e do þus, y sey hardly, ?e mow here ?oure mynstralsy. ?yf þou lyggë long yn synne, And wylt nat ryse, ne þerof blynne, Certeynly, for euery oure Þou shalt ?elde a-counte ful soure; For euery oure þat þou þeryn lay Yn purgatorye þou gest þy pay.

And some, alle þe ?ere wyllyn abyde Of shryftë tyl þe lentyn tyde; And nygh tyl lentyn be al gone Mede for fastyng gete þey none; Þat ys, for sloghnes þey wyl nat ryse; lyggyng yn synne, ys lore seruyse. And, sum men, yn alle here lyue, Clenly ne wylë þey hem shryue; For þey synne alle yn hope of grace, At here endyng wene þey haue space; Þan þenkë þey to shryue hem clene: To swyche men, God sheweþ hys tene. Hyt ys seyd al day, for þys skyl, “he þat wyl nat whan he may, He shal nat, when he wyl, [haue pay.]” And þer byþ many one ful euyl to wynne To any godenes fro vylë synne; Euyl tokyn hyt ys of swyche a man, God hym deme; for y ne kan.

Holy wrytë swyche men holdes As wyldë wuluës brekyng foldes. Swyche a personë ys ful slogh, Be he hygh, or be he logh. Man or womman þat haþ a chylde Þat wyþ vnþewys wexyþ wylde, Þat wyl boþe myssey and do, Chastysment behoueþ þarto; But ?e hem chastyse at ?oure my?t, ?e falle, ellys, for hem yn ply?t.

Þus seyth þe wys kyng Salamonn To men and wymmen euerychonn, “wyle ?e þat ?oure chyldryn be a-ferd, ?yueþ hem þe smert ende of þe ?erde;” And techeþ hem gode þewys echone; ?yt dur ?ow brekë hem no bone. [The Tale of the Father that would not chastise his Child.] y shal ?ow telle a wundyr þyng Þat fylle for defaute of chastysyng: Seynt Gregory telleþ, þat mochë kan, Of a folë husbunde man Þat hatede a chylde þat he furþe broght wykkedly, for he chastyed hym noght. Þys chylde was wurþy for to blame, For ofte he cursed Goddys name; whan aght was do a?ens hys wylle, He cursede Goddys name wyþ ylle. Seynt Gregory tellyþ hyt wyþ grete eye; But as he seyþ, þan dar y seye. Þys ychë chyld [sone] aftyrward Fyl yn[to] a syknes hard; Þe fadyr hadde þerof pyte, Þe chyld he daunted on hys kne, And haddë þarfor mochë kare Þat he sagh hys chylde so fare; For hyt began to braye and crye As, þogh hyt shuld al to-flye. Þe fadyr asked, why hyt so ferde, Or what hyt sagh, or what hyt herde. Þe chyldë seyd “blake men, blake, Aré aboutë, me to take; Me, wyþ hem, wyl þey lede, Y ne shal skapë for no nede.” Yn þe fadrys bosum hyt wulde hym hyde, But þe fende, þat ychë tyde, Refte þe saulë vnto helle. Þan began þe chylde to ?elle, And cursed onys Goddys name, And deyde, and ?ede to helle with shame. Þys yche chylde þat y haue of tolde, was but fyuë wyntyr olde. Þus þe chylde þat was so ?unge was lore for faute of chastysynge. But þe fadyr, þat no gode couþe, My?te haue chastyëd hym with mouþe, Stoutly, for euery a lak, And betë hyt, whan hyt so spak. Oueral y se þys custome wonys; Rychë men haue shrewed sonys,— Shrewys yn dedë and yn sawe,— why? For þey haue nonnë awe. Yn hys ?ouþe shal he mysseye And skornë ouþer by þe weye; Þan seyþ þe fadyr “þys chyldys wurde Ne shal nat ley allë yn hurde.” And ?yf he lernë gylerye, Fals wurde and feynt trenlyng with ye, Þat halte hys fadyr a queyntyse And of slygh wyt, to knowe þat wyse. ?yf he do skaþe gladly with fyght, Þan seyþ þe fadyr “he shal be wyght; He shal be hardy, and no man drede, He begynneþ be tyme be doghty yn dede.” But ryght so shal hyt of hem falle As dyd of Ely sonys alle. y shal ?ow telle, to preue my sawe, what fyl yn þe oldë lawe. yn þe byble hyt tellyþ, þat toucheþ swych þynges, yn þe holy boke of kynges; And wrytë hyt ys opunly, Of a patryark, syre Ely. [The tale of ‘Syre Ely’ and his wicked Sons.] Þys Ely was a man ry?t ryche, And, to hys chyldrén ryght blyche; he hadde twey sonys, þat ys no les, ‘Ofnee’ the toon hyght, þe touþer ‘Fynees.’ Þese twey chyldryn dyd ful wykkedly To man and woman þat þey come by; Lyers, robbours, and lechours, Skorners, and also auoutours; wymmen þat to þe temple come, here offryng from hem þey nome. Þese wymmen come to syre Ely, And pleyned hem of grete vyleynye, ‘Þat hys sonys were vnhende, hem also for to shende. O defaute was, þey by hem lay; A-noþer, þey bare here offryng away.’ “Do þerof sum chástysyng, For þe loue of heuene kyng!” Here fadyr Ely þan was wo, For þat yche fame shulde of hem go. Ely kalled hys sone, “Ofnee And Fyneës, come ?e to me! Sonës,” he seyde, “?e are me dere; y bydde ?ow boþe, on feyre manere, Þat ?e leue ?oure foly dedes, And ouþer foly þat ?ow ledys; Y herë of ?ow foulë fame, Þe folkë seyn ?e are to blame; Y rede ?e leue alle swych foly, Þat y of ?ow here no more cry.” Þese chyldryn were strong and stout; Of fadres byddyng þey hadde no dout, But werë shrewys for þe more, Or werse þan þey hadde be byfore; And God was wroþe wyþ here mysdede Þat þey ne leftë for no drede; And, God was wyþ Ely wroþe, For he dyd hys sones no loþe, To chastyse hem wyþ fyn awe And with þe smartnes of þe lawe. Þarfor toke god hys venïaunce Of hem, and mo, for þat myschaunce; He lete þe fals Phylystyens, Þe folk of Isrel to werre a?ens. Ely and hys, þey gunne assayle, And ouercome hem tweys yn batayle. Þese Phylystyens þat hadde þe maystry, Beleuyd on Dagoun, a maumettry. On a god þat þey kalled Dagoun, Beleued þe Phylystynes echoun. Þarefor hyt was but Goddys suffraunce Þat shewyd why þey hadde swych chaunce. Þe folk of Isrel had þoght, and syghte, For þey were twyys scumfyghte; Þey ordeyned hem on allë wyse how þey shulde best to batayle ryse, A?ens þe Phylystynes for to go, And hem dyscumfytë and slo. þey ordeyned hem for to bere Goddys arke with hem yn to were. Ely sones were stoute and stark, And were chose to bere Goddys ark; For reuerence þey ded hyt, of Ely, And for þey were of body doghty. Goddys ark was of swych manere As men make now shrynës here. yn þys ark werë þre þynges Þat men ?aue to here offrynges; Þar-yn was Moyses table whar-on God wrote þe lawë stable; And Aarons ?erd, and a potte of golde: Þese þre relykes þey helde ful holde. Yn þe pottë was a floure, whyte, and swete of al sauoure, Þat floure ys kalled ‘aungelys mete’ Þat God ?afe þe folke to ete whan þey were yn wyldernes Forty wyntyr, yn hard stres. Þese þyngës þan bare Ely sones yn-to þe batayle þat ?yt of mones. Þe phylystyens come hem for to assayle, And slogh Ely sonës yn batayle, And rauysshed Goddys ark þere, And slogh þe folk þat þer were, And þe relykys þat þere were ynne: Alle were lore for þe sonys synne. whan þe folk to þe batayle fore,?ede Ely sette hym at þe temple dore yn a chayre, and was herkenyng Fro þe batayle sum tydyng, On what manere þe folk shulde spede, For of Goddys ark he had grete drede. One come rennyng hastyly, And broghte þys tydyng to Ely Þat hys sonys were boþe slayn, And Goddys ark with myght and maynstrenkþ was bore away for euermore. Alas, þe sorow þat he hadde þerfore! whan Ely herd þys euyl tydyng, For sorowe he gan hys handys wryng, And fyl bakward of hys chayre, And brak on two hys swyer;nekke And of hys hede he brake þe bone, Þe harnësbrayn lay vpp-on þe stone. Þys ychë tale ys no tryfyl, For hyt ys wryte yn þe bybyl; And to ?ow y telle hyt here, ?oure sonys to chastyse and to lere, Þat ?e, ne þey, be nat shent For defaute of chastysment Bodyly, yn þys worlde here, And aftyr þat, þe soule so dere. Þenkeþ on Ely and on hys sonys; And to gode ?oure chyldryn wones. For, ryght so as hem gan tyde, Swyche as þey were, þe same mow byde. Of sloghnes þys ys þe assyse whan þou wylt nat betyme chastyse. ?yt ys þyr an ydulnes,— A grete vnwysdom for soþe hyt ys,— whan a ?unge man dragh lyte on lenkþe, And wyl nat trauayle yn hys ?ungþe, Ne lernë hym craft for to wynne, Yn hys agë to leue wel ynne. Certes me þenkeþ hym ful slogh; Hys þryfte wyl melte away with snogh. And þogh a man haue oght erytage Þat he may lyue wyþ weyl yn age, Certes ?yt behoueþ hym lere Manhede and curtesye yn fere. A man hys manhedë shal ?ernedesyre hymself and hys meynë to gouerne. Þus seyþ þe kyng Salamon, And þese holy men echone; “Hyt ys an ydulnes yn here lyfe, Alle þat ouþer man or wyfe Trauayleþ for þe lyuës fode, And lytyl for þe soulës gode. Þogh þou trauayle alle þat þou may, Ne be þou neuer so ryche ne gay, But þou serue God yn alle þy þoght Þat þy soule to heuene be broght, Sykyrlyche alle ys hyt but lore, Þy grete trauayle syn þou were bore; Alle for sloghthede be tolde hyt shal, To werche al day, and lese hyt alle. ?yt us þyr an vnkynde sloghþhede, Þat a man vnneþ, for no gode dede, wyl wurschep God derwrþly, But more þarfor a?ens hym ly. And mayst þou þe soþë se Of rychë men, how stout þey be; For many one þat he ?yfþ to rychesse, Of God and man þey ?yue no lesse. ?yf he ?yue to any hys ryght lemes, To þanke hym þerof, no man ?eue nymes. loke alle þy lymës, fete and hondes, And, ?yf þou weyl vndyrstondys Þat þou ne hast nedë of þo, Þank hym noþer yn wele no wo; And ?yf þou mayst forberë noun, Þank þan hym of euerychoun; y rede we þanke hym of euery poynt, Syn we may nat forbere þe lest Ioynt. ?yt þyr ys a sloghþehede yn þys synne; Vnkynde men are alle þer-ynne; yn sum man, vnkyndehede ys so rank Þat he ne may cunne no man þank For no gode dede þat men hym dous. A dogge ys kynder, þat goþ lous, For, ?yue a dogge þryd part hys fode, And he shal euer weyte þe gode, And euermorë be wyþ þe, For lyfë ne deþ wyl he fle. By þys skyl mayst þou se how An hounde ys kynder þan art þou; And ?yt may hyt preuyd be Þat þou art as vnkynde as he. Of þe houndë, þys y fynde, Þat most he hateþ hys owne kynde; For that yche houndë þat hym gat, Most of allë hateþ he þat; And hys modyr he hateþ also; He byt here, ?yf he may cum here to. ?yf ?e vndyrstondë kan, Þus faryþ hyt of a vnkynd man; For he loueþ more an ouþer kynde, And þarto ys wel morë mynde, Þan he douþ þat ychë flesshe Of whos kynde he cum forþe ys. A-noþer þyng ?yt ys, ?yf þou ?eue kepe, Þat many loue more nete and shepe Þan he douþ hys emcrystene, Or of hys harme wyl oght bemene. And þys ys a grete vnkyndnes, And also a?en manhede hyt ys; And sloghþëhede wel for to proue, Vnkyndly, and lowe, to loue. ?yf þou art yn godë wyl To seruë God, and leue alle yl, Repente þe nat, for no feyntyse, Ne be nat heuy to hys seruyse; Þou shuldyst raþer to þe deþ turne Ar þou shust wyþ hys seruyse scorne. ?yf þou bygynne weyl, y rede þou ende, For fyrst and last þou fyndyst hym hende. And ?yf þou bygynne any þyng, Þenk what shal be þe endyng. For þogh þou seruë God to pay, Alle þy lyfe, boþe ny?t and day, And at þe laste ende of þy lyffe Þou fallyst a?ens hym yn stryffe, So þat þou yn þat ychë synne Makyst þan þy endyng ynne, God forget alle þy gode dede; Of hym þerfor gest þou no mede. Ryght so ys he to þe redy whan þou wylt leue alle þy foly, And come to hym with répentaunce, yn blys he makeþ þy puruyaunce. At þe ende shal boþe dede and þoght Shewe hym self how hyt ys wroght. Ne be nat þou sorowful, y þe forbede; hyt semyþ, yn Goddys seruyse þan þou hast drede; And dredë wyl make a man slogh To do þe seruyse þat he hogh. But serue hym gladly with louely chere, Þan ys þy seruyse to hym dere: Þus techyþ vs Dauid þe prophete yn þe sautyr, wurdys swete; “Ne be nat proude þogh þou weyl dous, yn þyn herte to make a rous”boste Þat þou holy lyfë ledys, Yn fastyng, or yn almës dedys. Þe fyrst ys ouer mochë drede, Þe touþer ys proude hauncenhede. Holde þe euene hem betwene, Nat ouer-drede ne ouer-wene. No make no sorowe, ne myslyke, Þat wanhope In þyn hertë styke; For þat ys þe werst poynt of alle; To hellë þyt hyt doþe þe falle. Sloghënes, hyt wyl þe grope To bryngë þe yn-to whanhope; Sloghnes yn allë godë dedys, Ys as moche, as sum men redys, As þogh þou shryue þe of a synne, And þenke no more to falle þer-ynne. ?yf þou be slogh, and heuy, And doust no gode dede of mercy, Þus seyþ God yn hys gospel, Þat “þou art to me a voyde vessel.” Ful lyght þan art þou for to turne A?en to synne, and to soiurne; Þan art þou wersë þan þou was, Boundë vn-to Satanas; Þan wylle Satanas begynne to prykke, And whanhope yn þy hertë stykke. whanhope, God shelde vs þar-fro, hyt steryþ a man hym self to slo; So ded þe treytur Iudas, And forsoþe, wurþy he was. why was he moste wurþy? For he hadde wanhope of Goddys mercy; For he wendë þat God ne wulde Haue for?yue hym, þat he hym solde. Syþþen loked God vpp-on Iudas, As who sey, “aske mercy for þy trespas.” For ?yf he had asked hyt any syþe, Ihesu hadde graunted hym asswyþe; For hys mercy fayled noght To any man þat hym besoght. Syn God wulde haue be to hym so fre, Þan ys he redy to þe and me: whychë tyme þou wylt hym kalle, For hys defaute þou shalt nat falle. Beþenke þe weyl of þe þefe Þat loued nat God, no was hym lefe,— he þat was hanged on a tre Bysydë Ihesu for vylte; he spake o wurde at hys endyng. “lordë, haue on me menyng!” And asswyþe he wan þe prys, And was sent yn-to paradys. he was þe fyrst[ë] þat hyt wan Syn Adam lost hyt, oure formest man. Er was þat þefe yn paradys Þan alle prophetys þat were of prys. Þat þefe alle manere wys dyd synne, And neuer ere leuyd Ihesu ynne; For a wurde þat he spak so myldëly, he haþ pes, blys, and mercy. And, þarfor, dysmay þe noght For no þyng þat þou hast wroght; For, haue þou do neuer so mykyl, Ne be so fals, ne so fykyl, Ne ley þer-ynnë so long whyle, And do alle maner synnës vyle, ?yf þou wylt, yn strenkþe and hele, Þy synne forsake and nat wyþ dele, with sorow of herte and répentaunce Þou mayst pay God with lytyl penaunce. God seyþ þys wurde, to shew vs þe wey, “y wyl þat nonë synful deye; To leue hys synne he shal haue space, And turne a?en to lyfe and grace; what so euer he haue done, y wyl nat hys dampnacyone.” To ?yue a sample, a tale here lys, Þat vs telleþ seynt Dyonys. [The Tale of the Priest Carpus's Vision, and how merciful God is.] Seynt Dyonys of Fraunce seyþ þus:— hyt was a prest þat hyght Carpus; Þys prest, þurgh prechyng and sawe, Broght a sarysyn to crystyn lawe; A-noþer sarasyn of paynye Haddë þerwyþ grete enuye, And turnede þys man to hym a?eyn, And oure crystyndom was alle veyn. Þys prest þarëfor was sory, And hatyd þys man felunly, And preydë God he wuld hym sende Dampnacyun with-outyn ende, For he þe crystendom forsoke, And to a fals beleue hym toke; Fast he preyd yn hys atent, þat God on hym veniauncë sent. And God þe prestys prayere herde, And shewed hym þat he mysferde. Þys prest lay yn hys bede a ny?t, And, gostly, he sagh a syght;— he sagh a swyþe merueylus brygge Ouer þe depë pytte gan lygge, Þe plank þat on þe bryggë was, was as sledyr as any glas; But yn þe put þat was þer-vndyr, he sagh so moche sorowe and wundyr, Of fendës felë þat þere wore, Þogh y tolde moche, ?yt were þer more. But, shortly to tellë fro, Þe man he sagh on þe bryggë go Yn ful gretë perel and kare, And euer yn poynt to mysfare; Yn poynt he was to falle adowne, Of hys hede, formest þe crowne. Þe fendys þat were yn þe pytte Smote vpwarde, ?yf þey my?t hym hytte; And addres bete hym by þe fete. Þe prest sagh þat, and ful weyl lete; He preydë God þat he shuld falle Down yn-to þe fendys alle, And þer, with-outyn endë be, ‘For he turned away fro þe.’ whan þe prest had seyë þys, He loked vp to heuene blys; Hym þoght þe rofe was cloue yn two, And þe sky opened also, And of Ihesu he hadde a syght, How he was on þe rodë dyght; He sagh hys wundys alle blody, And spak to hym ful sorowfully, “Carpus,” he seyd, “se wyþ þyn yne what y suffred for mannys pyne; Man to saue, y lete me slo, why wust þou dampnë hym to wo? why hast þou hym so moche with ylle? And for mankynde y lete me spylle with pyne, and hardë passyoun, My blode y ?af for hys raunsun; why wust þou he hadde hellë fere Syn y haue boght hym so dere? ?yt were y redy man to beye, Er man with-outyn ende shulde deye. But y haue shewde hym so moche yn dede with my wundes þat þou seest blede, þat y þarfor ne wuldë noght Lese þat y so dere haue boght. A?ens me ne fyndeþ he no skylle, But ?yf hys ownë wylle hyt wylle. Þogh he be nowe a?ens me went, ?yt kepe y hys amendëment; Þarfor, with gode deuocyoun, Pray for mannys saluacyoun.” Þan Carpus þanked God almyght Þat he hadde herde and seye þat syght. Þarfore shul we be ful mynde To serue hym þat ys to vs so kynde, And shewe hym loue whyle we be here For þat he loveþ vs alle so dere, Þat he ne wulde leue eft, for drede, To deye for vs ?yf we hadde nede. Ne be we slogh, but sone vpryse, Ne dredë vs þan on no wyse, But, hope alle to gode endyng, And serue þat mercyáble kyng, Þat hys mercy be to vs lent At þe day of Iugëmement; Amen! so motë hyt betyde To kepe vs fro sloghnes and accyde! [Of Covetousness, 5th Deadly Sin.] Now shul we speke of couetyse, How hy ys haunted on wykked wyse. Coueytyse ys þe fryst vyce; Þat streyte ys holde, y halte auaryce. Coueytyse ys of vs echone, But auaryce wulde haue echone. Coueytyse, ys desyryng of þoght, But auaryce, wulde þat none had oght. Coueytyse, cumþ oþerwhyle of gode; But auaryce wyþdrawyþ mannys fode. Coueytyse, to gode men mowe hyt charge; But auaryce, ys noþer gode ne large. Coueytyse, ys of wylle, as ys a bayte, But auaryce, ys nygun haldyng strayte; Coueytyse, cumþ of kynde of blode; But auaryce, ys noþer kynde ne gode. As y kan telle, þys ys þe assyse, Betwyxe auaryce and coueytyse. Here, y aske at þe bygynnyng, ?yf þou with wrong ?erned oþer mennys þyng, Or falsly purchased: þat ys grete synne, So with wrong mennys gode to wynne. ?yf þou withholde, and ?elde hyt noght, Auaryse to hellë haþ þe broght. Yn þy lyfe, y rede þou ?elde hyt a?en, Þy saluacyun ys ellës alle veyn. ?yf þou madest euer any delay, And ledyst one lyte fro day to day with þy wurdys pryuyly, Or perauenture al on hy, For to haue hys þyng with wrong, Euyl coueytyse þou mengest among. Þogh þou broghtest hyt neuer to dede, ?yt ys þy wylle moche for to drede. Or ?yf þou dedyst euer þy myght To false a chartre, þat ys grete plyght. Þat ys a dede of tresun ?yf hyt be of dysheresun, Ouþer of lond, ouþer of rent, Oþer of ouþer gode þat God man haþ lent; But þou þe peynë ny?t and day To amende þat charge, ?yf þat þou may, ?yf hyt ne be, þou art to blame; Ordeyned to þe ys mochë shame. ?yf þou yn batayle, or in fy?t, Toke oght of man with-outë ry?t, And namely of relygyun, Þe harder ys þy synnë doun: And but þou sone amendë þe, Þarfor mayst þou acumbred be: Hyt ys wurþy hym for to dere Þat holy cherche wyl nat forbere. ?yf þou of rychesse be wel beforne, And a ?ere or two holdyst þy corne Þat þou my?t selle hyt ry?t dere, And to helpe þe pore þou wylt nat here, Salamon seyþ, þat mochë kan, Þou shalt be weryed with many man; For þou ?yuest myys to ?ete Þat was ordeyned to mannys mete; For who so wyl hys myys wel fede, And spare hyt fro þe pore at nede, hyghly shal he go a-lone To þe deuyl, body and bone. ?yf þou haue of ouþer tresour, More þan susteyneþ þyn onour,— Syluer, cloþes, or ouþer store, Or of ouþer þyngës more,— ?yf þe pore for defautë deye, And þou mayst hym helpe, y seye, Þou are a-couped of þys vyce Of coueytyse, and of auaryce; And before God, of þeft, a þefe, And for hys deþ, of slaghter grefe. ?yf þou yn falshede so moche ?ede, For coueytyse or for grete mede To consente to a fals Iuggyng, Or hyredyst a voket to swyche þyng, Or myghtyst haue sturbled hyt, &amp; wust noght, But for coueytyse þe wrong were wroght, Moche shal God challengë þe, Þat day þat þou Iuged shal be. As for lordynges cunseylours, wykked legystrys or fals a-countours, Þey ne recche of no ry?t fey, Ne more þe lordynges þan do þey; Cunseyl to wykked lawes þey ?eue, So þat þe pore men mow nat lyue: Þarfor, þey and here lordyngys Doun moche wrong yn many þyngys; Þarfor shul þey and here cunsayl Go to helle, boþe top and tayle. Many man ys broght ful bare For cunseylours þat coueytous are; And many a land yn grete errours Are ouer-turned þurgh cunseylours. Among hem, stywardes mow be tolde, Þat lordyngës courtys holde, For nyrhand euery a styward, Þe dome þat þey ?eue, ys ouer hard; And namely to þe porë man, Þey greuë hym alle þat þey kan. who-so-euer to mercy wyl hym drawe, he seyþ, he shal do hym but lawe; But who so shal þe lawe alle do, And no mercy do þar-to, he may neuer for mercy craue To God whan he wulde mercy haue; For ?yf God shal deme with lawe ry?t, Shal no man come to heuene ly?t. But þurgh grace and hys mercy, Þan are we saued certeynly. Þarfor, ?e stywardes on benche, Þer-on shulde ?e allë þenche, ‘?yf þou of þe porë haue pyte, Þan wylle God haue mercy on þe.’ For hardë dome and coueytyse y shal ?ow telle of swych a Iustyse.

Godë men ofte hym besoght For þe pore, þat he wo wroght, Þat he shulde haue on hem mercy, And pylle hem nat but mesurly; Þat þey my?t lyue yn pes by hym, And be nat so a?ens hem grym. Þys was hys answere and hys sawe, ‘Y shal do hem no þyng but lawe.” And many lawes are oute of skylle, But, ?yf þér be mercy tylle. was hyt nat long aftyrward, He fyl yn a sykenes hard; Hyt telleþ of hym swych a chaunce, He hadde no godë répentaunce; Hys sykënes wax harde and strong, Þat he my?t nat lyuë long; For allë hoped weyl y-nogh Þat he vn-to þe deþ faste drogh. Men þat sate a-boute hys bedde were a-gast, and sore a-dredde; And hopyd wel, and vndyrstode Þat here drede was for no gode. Allë þey behelde hym faste, And sawe hys coloure ofte ouer caste; And wroth a-boutë, to and fro; Hys bedde hym þoght wulde cleue on two; And crydë with a loudë cry, “Lordë, haue on me mercy!” Þan spake a voycë yn þe sky, Þat alle hyt herde þat stode hym by, “Þou haddest neuer of man pyte, Ne y shal neuer haue noun of þe.” Asswyþë he dëyd yn haste; Þere he shulde go, he ?alde þe gaste. ?e domës men þat þys chaunce here, Yn þys talë mowe ?e lere what hyt ys to do euer wreche, And to mercy no þyng reche. Hauyþ yn ?oure þoght, mercy, and se, Þe pore mow nat so weyl as ?e; Beþ mercyáble for ?oure prow Þat God ne take veniaunce on ?ow. ?yf þou haue be so coueytous To mercs men ouer outraious, And porë men, specyaly, Þat ferde þe wers for þat mercy, Sykyr mote þou be, syre styward, Þy mercyment shal be ful hard. Þy wreched soule þarfor shal dwelle; Þy mercyment shal be þe þyne of helle. Þou baylë, owest nat to take (For drede of soule, and þyn oth sake,) Þat þy lordes prow be þe lasse, Ne noun of hys do harder stresse.” So shulde eche aturne seriaunt; But many one holde no cunnaunt; For, sum take ful greuusly, Þat ful sore shal come hem by. Alle þat þey takë now to frest, Þérof shál God take a quest. Þe quest ys take and draght on hym; Accord þe wyþ þy lorde, betym.

As þey spak of many what, Comë Pers forþ yn þat gat:wey Þan seyd echoun þat sate and stode, ‘here comþ Pers, þat neuer dyd gode!’ Echoun seyd to oþer Iangland, ‘Þey toke neuer gode at Pers hand; Ne noun pore man neuer shal haue, Coude he neuer so weyl craue.’ One of hem began to sey “A waiour dar y wyþ ?ow ley, Þat y shal haue sum gode at hym, Be he neuer so gryl ne grym.” To þat waiour þey graunted alle, To ?yue hym a ?yft ?yf so my?t befalle. Þys man vp sterte, and toke þe gate, Tyl he com, at Pers ?ate. As he stode stylle, and bode þe quede, One come with an asse charged with brede; Þat ychë bredë Pers hade boght, And to hys hous shuld hyt be broght. He sagh Pers comë þerwith-alle; Þe porë þoght ‘now aske y shal.’ “Y aske þe sum gode, pur charyte, Pers, ?yf þy wyl be.” Pers stode, and loked on hym Felunlyche with y?en grym. He stouped down to seke a stone, But, as hap was, þan fonde he none. For þe stone he toke a lofe, And at þe porë man hyf drofe. Þe pore man hente hyt vp belyue, And was þerof ful ferly blyþe. To hys felaws faste he ran with þe lofe, þys porë man, “lo,” he seydë, “what y haue Of Pers ?yft, so God me saue!” Nay, þey sworë by here þryft, Pers ?aue neuer swych a ?yft. he seyd, “?e shul weyl vndyrstonde Þat y hyt had, at Pers honde; Þat dar y swere on þe halydom Here beforë ?ow echoun.” Gretë merueyle had þey alle, Þat swych a chaunce my?t hym befalle. Þe þryddë day, þus wryte hyt ys, Pers fyl yn a grete syknes; And, as he lay yn hys bedde, Hym þoght weyl, þat he was ledde with one þat aftyr hym was sent, To come vn-to hys Iugëment. Before þe Iugë was he broght To ?elde acounte how he hadde wroght. Pers stode ful sore a-drad, And, was ábashed as mad; He sagh a fende on þe to party, Bewreyyng hym ful felunly; Alle hyt was shewed hym before, how he had lyued syn he wos bore; And namely euery wykked dede Syn fyrst he coudë hym self lede; why he hem dyd, and for what chesun, Of alle behoueþ hym to ?elde a resoun. On þe touþer party stode men ful bry?t, Þat wulde haue saued hym at here my?t; But þey myght no godë fynde Þat my?t hym sauë or vnbynde. Þe feyre men seyd “what ys to rede? Of hym fynde we no godë dede Þat God ys payd of, but of a lofe þe whych Pers at þe pore man drofe: ?yt ?aue he hyt with no gode wylle, But kast hyt aftyr hym with ylle; For Goddys loue ?aue he hyt no?t, Ne for almes dede he hyt had þoght. Noþeles, þe porë man Had þe lofë of Pers þan.” Þe fendë had leyd yn balaunce Hys wykkede dedes and hys myschaunce; Þey leyd þe lofe a?ens hys dedys,— Þey had no?t ellës, þey mote nedys— Þe holy man telleþ vs, and seys, Þat þe lofe made euen peys. Þan seyd þese feyrë men to Pers, “?yf þou be wys, now þou leres How þys lofe þe helpeþ at nede To tylle þy soule with almës dede.” Pers, of hys slepë gan blynke, And gretly on hys dreme gan þynke— Syghyng with mornyng chere, As man þat was yn gretë were,— How þat he acouped was with fendës fele for hys trespas, And how þey wulde haue dampned hym þere, ?yf mercy of Ihesu Cryst ne were. Alle þys yn hys herte he kast, And to hym self he spak at þe laste, “Þat, for a lofe yn eueyl wylle Halpe me yn so grete perel, Mochë wlde hyt helpe at nede, with godë wyl do almës dede. Fro þat tymë þan wax Pers A man of so feyrë maners, Þat no man my?t yn hym fynde, But to þe pore boþe meke and kynde; A mylder man ne my?t nat be, Ne to þe pore, more of almes fre; And reuful of herte also he was, Þat mayst þou here lere yn þys pas. Pers mette, vp-on a day, A porë man, by þe way, As naked as he was bore, Þat yn þe see had allë lore. He come to Pers, þere he stode, And asked hym sum of hys gode,— Sumwhat of hys cloþyng,— For þe loue of heuene kyng. Pers, was of reuful herte, He toke hys kyrtyl of, as smert, And ded hyt on þe man aboue, And bad hym were hyt for hys loue. Þe man hyt toke, and was ful blyþe; He ?ede and soldë hyt asswyþe. Pers stode and dyd beholde How þe man þe kyrtyl solde, And was þarwith ferly wroþe Þat he solde so sone hys cloþe; He my?t no lenger for sorow stande, But ?edë home ful sore gretand, And seyd, ‘hyt was an euyl sygne, And þat hym self was nat dygne For to be yn hys preyere, Þerfor nolde he þe kyrtyl were.’ Whan he haddë ful long grete,wepte And a party þerof began lete;— For, comunlych aftyr wepe, Fal men sone on slepe,— As Pers lay yn hys slepyng, Hym þoght a feyrë sweuenyng. Hym þoght he was yn heuene ly?t, And of God he had a syght, Syttyng yn hys kyrtyl clad Þat þe pore man of hym had, And spak to hym ful myldëly, “why wepest þou, and art sory? Lo, Pers,” he sayde, “þys ys þy cloth. For he solde hyt, were þou wroth; Know hyt weyl, ?yf þat þou kan, For me þou ?aue hyt þe pore man. Þat þou ?aue hym yn charyte, Euery deyl þou ?aue hyt me.” Pers of slepë outë breyde, And þoght grete wunder, &amp; seþen seyd, “Blessyd be allë porë men, For God almy?ty loueþ hem; And weyl ys hem þat pore are here; Þey are with God, boþe lefe and dere; And y shal fonde, by ny?t and day, Tó be pore, ?yf þat y may.” Hastly he tokë hys kateyl, And ?aue hyt to porë men echedeyl. Pers kalled to hym hys clerk Þat was hys notarye, and bade hym herk, “Y shal þe shewe a pryuyte, A þyng þat þou shalt do to me; y wyl þat þou no man hyt telle; My body y take þe here to selle To sum man, as yn bondage, To lyue in pouert and yn seruage; But þou do þus, y wyl be wroth, And þou and þyne shal be me loth. ?yf þou do hyt, y shal þe ?yue Ten pownd of gold, wel with to lyue; Þo ten pownd y take þe here, And me to selle on bonde manere; Y ne recchë vn-to whom, But onlych he haue þe crystendom; Þe raunsun þat þou shalt for me take, Þarfore þou shalt sykernes make, For to ?yue hyt bleþely and weyl To porë men, euëry deyl, And withholde þerof no þyng, Þe mountouns of a ferþyng.” hys clerk was wo to do þat dede, But only for manas and for drede. For dredë Pers made hym hyt do, And dede hym plyghte his trouthe þer-to. Whan hys clerk had made hys othe, Pers dede on hym a foulë clothe; Vnto a cherchë boþe þey ?ede For to fulfylle hys wyl yn dede. whan þat þey to þe cherchë com, “Lorde, þoght þe clerk, now whom My?t y fynde, þys ychë sele,man To whom y my?t sellë Pers wele!” Þe clerk loked euery where, And at þe last, he knew where; A rychë man, þat er had be Specyal knowlych euer betwe, But þurgh myschauncë at a kas Alle hys gode y-lorë was; ‘?ole,’ þus þat man hyghte, And knew þe clerk wel be syghte. Þey spak of oldë a-queyntaunce, And ?olë tolde hym of hys chaunce. “Þe,” seyde þe clerk, “y rede þou bye A man to do þy marchaundye, Þat þou mayst holdë yn seruage To restore weyl þyn dammage.” Þan seyde ?ole, “on swych chaffare wulde y feyn my syluer ware.” Þe clerkë seyd, “lo, one here, A trew man an a dubonure, Þat wyl seruë þe to pay, Peyneblë, al þat he may. ‘Pers,’ shalt þou calle hys name; For hym shalt þou haue mochë frame. he ys a man ful gracyous, Gode to wynne vn-to þyn hous, And God shal ?yue þe hys blessyng, And foysyn, yn allë þyng.” Þe clerk ?aue allë hys raunsun To þe pore men of þe toun, Plenerly, alle þat he toke, wyþhelde he nat a ferþyng noke. Þe Emperoure sent hys messageres alle aboute for to sekë Pers, But þey ne my?t neuer here Of rychë Pers, þe tollere, yn what stedë he was nome, No whydyrward he was become; No þe clerk wuld telle to none, whydyrward þat Pers was gone. Now ys Pers bycomë bryche,logh Þat er was boþe stoute and ryche. Alle þat euer any man hym do bade, Pers dyd hyt with hert[ë] glad. he wax so myldë and so meke, A mylder man þurt no man seke; For he meked hym self ouer skyle, Pottes and dysshes for to swele. To grete penaunce he gan hym take, And mochë for to fast and wake, And moche he loued þolmodnesse To ryche, to pore, to more, to lesse. Of allë men he wuld haue doute, And to here byddyng mekly loute; wulde þey bydde hym sytte or stande, Euer he wuldë be bowande; And for he bare hym so meke and softe, Shrewës mysded hym ful ofte, And heldë hym folted or wode, For he was so mylde of mode. And þey þat were hys felaus Mysseyd hym most yn herë sawes; And alle he suffred here vpbreyd, And neuer naght a?ens hem seyde. ?ole, hys lorde, wel vndyrstode Þat al hys gracë and hys gode Com for þe loue of Pers, Þat was of so holy maners; And whan he wyst of hys bounte, He kalled Pers yn pryuyte, “Pers,” he seyd, “þou were wurþy For to be wurscheped more þan y, For þou art weyl with Ihesu; He sheweþ for þe grete vertu; Þarfor y shal make þe fre; Y wyl þat my felaw þou be.” Þar-to Pers granted noght, To be freman, as he besoght; he wuldë be, as he was ore, yn þat seruage for euermore. he þanked þe lorde myldëly For hys gretë curteysy. Syþþen Ihesu, þurgh hys my?t, Shewed hym, tó Pers sy?t, For to be stalworþe yn hys fondyng, And to hym haue loue longyng. “Be nat sorowful to do penaunce; y am with þe yn euery chaunce; Pers, I hauë mynde of þe; lo, here þe kyrtyl þat þou ?aue for me; Þerfor grace y shal þe sende, Yn alle godenessë weyl to ende.” Byfyl þat seriauntes and squyers Þat were wunt to seruë Pers, went yn pylgrymage, as yn kas, To þat cuntre þere Pers was. ?ole ful feyrë gan hem kalle, And preyde hem homë to hys halle. Pers was þere, þat ychë sele, And euerychone he knew hem wele. Alle he serued hem as a knaue Þat was wunt here seruyse to haue. But Pers nat ?yt þey knew, For penaunce chaunged was hys hew;colour Nat forþy þey behelde hym fast, And oftyn to hym here y?en þey kast, And seyd, “he þat stontë here, Ys lychë to Pers tollere.” He hydde hys vysege al þat he my?t, Out of knowlych of here sy?t; Noþeles þey behelde hym more, And knew hym weyl, al þat were þore, And seyd, “?ole, ys ?one þy page? A ryche man ys yn þy seruage; Þe emperoure, boþe fer and nere, Haþ do hym seche, þat we fynde here.” Pers lestned, and herd hem spekyng, And þat þey had of hym knowyng; And pryuyly a-wey he nam, Tyl he to þe porter cam. Þe porter had hys spechë lore, And heryng also, syn he was bore; But þurgh þe grace of swete Ihesu, was shewed, for Pers, feyre vertu. Pers seyd, “latë me furþ go.” Þe porter spak, and seydë “?o.” He þat was def, and doumbe also, Spak, whan Pers spak hym to. Pers out at þe ?atë wente, And þedyr ?ede, þere God hym sente. Þe porter ?ede vp to þe halle, And þys merueylë tolde hem alle, How þe squyler of þe kechyn, Pers, þat haþ woned here yn, “He asked leuë, ry?t now late, And went furþ out at þe ?ate. Y rede ?ow alle, ?eueþ gode tent, whederward þat Pers ys went. with Ihesu cryst he ys pryue, And þat ys shewed weyl on me; For, what tyme he to me spak, Out of hys mouþ me þoghtë brak A flamme of fyre bryght and clere; Þe flaumme made me boþ speke and here; Speke, and here, now, boþe y may, Blessed be God and Pers to day!” Þe lordë and þe gestës alle, One and oþer þat were yn halle, Had merueyle þat hyt was so, Þat he my?te swych myrácle do. Þan asswyþë Pers þey soght, But al here sekyng was for no?t; Neuer, Pers þey ne founde, Ny?t ne day, yn no stounde; For he þat toke Ennok and Ely, He toke Pers, þurgh hys mercy, To reste with-outyn ende to lede For hys meknes and hys gode dede. Take ensample here, of Pers, And parteþ with þe pore, ?e okerers, For ?ow shal neuer come Ioye with-ynne, But ?e leuë fyrst þat synne; And ?yue to almes þat ychë þyng Þat ?e haue wune wyþ okeryng. Now with God, leue we Pers; God ?yue vs grace to do hys maners! Yn coueytyse synnen marchauntys mekyl, Yn feyrë wurdys and yn fykyl, And heteþ hym godë þat he byeþ, And swereþ þarto, and algate lyeþ. For fals peys and fals mesure here soulës haue mysáuenture. Also hyt longeþ to coueytyse ?yf þou hyre one out of seruyse Þurgh ?yft or þurgh procurment, Þou synnest gretly yn swych atent: Enuye hyt ys, and falsnes yn dede, But ?yf hyt were for þe morë nede. ?yf þou boghtest of any seriaunt pryuyly, yn stylle cunnaunt, Þyng þat þou wystyst wel was stole, And þurgh þy byyng was forhole, Hyt ys coueytyse and þeft pryue To bye þyng out of commalte. ?yf þou receyuedyst any what Of onë þat hys þyng forgat; But þou ?yue hyt hym a?eyn, Or þe valeu for certeyn, Þou art falle þan yn þe vyce Of, coueytyse, þeft, and auaryce.

Of þys, before ?e herde me rede, How seynt Fursyn founde hyt yn dede; And here y shal telle a lytyl tale Of swyche a man þat brewed hys bale. [The Tale of Lucretius, and how the Devil leapt into him.] Þyr was a man þat hyght Lucrecyus, A swyþë ryche and coueytous; Besyde hym wonèd a mayden wys, Here name was kalled Beatrys. Lucrecyus þoght on felonye; here landës he wulde algate bye. And, shortly ?ow for to telle, Þys lady wuldë nat hem selle. when he wyst hyt, þan was hym wo; He weyted here, and ded here slo. whan he hád do here þat pyne, Yn alle here landes he toke sesyne, And was þan a ryche lordyng And bare hym stoutë as a kyng. Þys Lucrecyus made a feste, A ryche, with men of noble geste. Þe lordyngës þat he my?t gete were settë with hym at þe mete; And as he sat yn alle hys pryde, Com a pore womman þat tyde, And bare a chylde yn cloþës loke, Þe pappe yn þe mouþe as hyt had soke; Hyt hade neuer spoke before, saun? fayle, Þarfor y telle hyt, þe more meruayle. As for grete myrácle, þe chyld seyd þus, “y sey to þe, Lucrecyus, Þat þou hast slayn seynt Beatrys, To haue here lond þat by here lys. Þou art come now vn-to here fe, And syttest þere yn þy pouste; And y comaunde, þurgh Goddys my?t, Þe deuyl, yn-to þe to ly?t.” As sonë as þe chylde had spoke, Þe fendë yn-to hym was lope, And traueyled hym þre dayys with pyne Þat alle hyt sawë with here yne; And, at þe þre day[y]s ende, He deydë, and to helle gan wende. loke now, how þe deuyl hym laght For coueytyse of wurldys aght. Ful wykked ys þat coueytyse, with oþer mennes gode falsly to ryse. ?yt hyt ys wers þan ys þe lore To do a man to deþ þarfore. Of God almy?ty haþ he noun eye, Ne he ne þenkeþ for to deye; On hys deþ he þenkeþ neuer, And þarfor deyeþ he for euer. “?e ryche men, ?e ryche purchasours, ?e wene þat al þe worlde be ?ours; And yn alle ?oure moste purcháce Comþ ?oure deþ sunnest yn place; God sheweþ hyt oftë to ?ow; Þenkeþ þéron for ?oure prow. What seye ?e by þese streyte negons Þat se al day Goddës persones Before hem deyë for mysese, And þey are ryche and wel at ese, And, ?yt mow þey no þyng spare To helpe þe porë þat mys fare.

As wykkedly, me þenkeþ ys hyt doun, A man to gadyr oute of resoun, And do þerwith noun almës dede, Porë men to helpe at nede. A man þat haþ pens in chest, Vnneþes to slepe haþ he rest; with alle þat go nerhond, hym greues, For alle, he weneþ þat þey be þeues; Þus seyþ he þat gadreþ tresoure, Of alle þat go byfore hys dore. Swych euyl þoghtes here soulë þenkeþ, And seye of hem euyl, þat noun hym þenkeþ.

Sykyr lyfe shalt þou noun lede; Þyn herte ys þerfor euer yn drede.” And herë y shal telle a lyte, A wurdë of a gode Ermyte. [The Tale of the good Hermit who gave away the Money he had saved.] An ermyte woned fer ouer a doune, yn a wasteyne, fer fro þe toune; Þys ermyte þoght vp-on a day Þat he was yn febyl aray, And seyd, he wulde gader to store Tyl eftsones he had nedë more. He gadred vn-to storë fast, Þat hys purs he fylled at þe last. Þo was he yn grete stodye where he my?t do hyt pryuylye, For to lese hyt he was a dred; And ?ede and leyd hyt at hys bed. whan he shuld slepë, he my?t noght, So mochë on hyt was hys þoght; whan he sagh men come or go, He þoghte and seydë, “þeues are þo.” Euery man he wened had be a robbour, For dredë þat he had tresoure. And whan he seyd hys oures of þe day, He þoght on hys tresour þer hyt lay. And more was he þan morenande Seþen þan beforëhand: Þan seyd hym self, “weyl y ferde Ar y, yn purs, penys sperde; Now slepe y neuer but with kare, Syn y wyst, whére pens ware.” “y trowe,” he seyde, “þat Goddys curs ys spred with pens, yn þe purs.” he ros vp and ?ede to hys ?ate, And sagh twey men come yn þe gate; He parseyued weyl whydyrward þey cam, And swyþe aftyr hys purs he ran, And kast hyt to hem euery deyl, And seyd, “haueþ, and broukeþ hyt weyl, For, myn herte was neuer yn reste Syn y had hem a ny?tys geste; For shal y neuer, aftyr þys day, Purs, pens, ?yf þat y may.” Þarfor he þat mekel has, Hys herte ys yn many a kas; Syn þat þykë pore ermyte was yn dredë for so lyte. Auaryce ys þy mochë fo; Þe loue of God hyt dragheþ þe fro; And syluer algat[e], namëly, Hyt ys a god of maumetry; For maumetry ys madë alle Of golde and syluer and swych matalle, þe sara?yns and ouþer wan bodyes, Þer-of þey make þat are here goddes; Þarefor y rede þat ?e loue hyt noght, Ne ouer moche to haue yn thoght: Þyr ys no þyng yn erþe aboue, Þat draghþ so mochë mannës loue Fro God, né fro Goddys wurde, As golde and syluer leyde yn hurde; And y haue oftë herdë seye Of sum men whan þey shuldë deye, Þat, þey wulde haue her pens ete Raþer þan any ouþer had hem gete; And, here ar y ferþer go, y shal telle of one þat ded so.

[The Tale of the Three Dishonest Executors.] A tale y herde a gode man sey, how a man dyd whan he shuld deye: he ches hym þre executours, Of al hys godys ordeynours, Twey lewed men and a clerke, To do gode yn soulë werke.

[On Gluttony.] The syxtë synne ys glotonye; Þat ys a shameful vyleynye Þat men doun of mete and drynk, For ouermoche ys abominable &amp; stynk. y wyl now shewë of hys spyces, Þat noun fallë on hys grecys: Ful many on stumble vp and down Of þe greces of syre glotown. y shal ?ow telle þe samë wyse Ry?t as ‘manuel pecches’ seyse: he comaundeþ, at þe bygynnyng, ‘Be mesuráble yn alle þyng.’ Of allë wysdom þat shal dure, Þe most wysdom, þan ys ‘mesure’; Mesure and resun, to-gedyr þey wone, And alle manere of vertues þey kone. with whom þey wonë, he ys wys, And ys ryche, and holdyn yn prys. hyt ys a gode sygne þat man ys stable, Þat yn resun ys mesuráble. Many a vertu, mesure has, Þat touched ys nat yn þys pas. But þe mesure of etyng, Þát ys boþe to olde and ?yng; Þarefore wyl y telle ?ow alle Yn what þyngës þat ?e falle. Be nat to þy self so large, Ouer mesure þyn herte to charge, Þat þou ne kast for vylaynye Ne for þe foule lust of glotonye. Þenk here-on whan þou hyt bygynnys, For þer-yn are þre wykked synnes: Glotonye, and þefte of þyng, And cursed yn chyrche, ys mede endyng. And y warne þe of þys kas, To comone with any þat cursyng has, Þat þou wystyst opunly were cursed with holy cherches cry. ?yf þou dedyst hyt by þy wylle, wyþ-oute destresse or lordys wylle, Holy cherche ys wroth wyþ þe astyt, And halt hyt pryde and grete dyspyt, And seyþ þou art vnbuxum, And manteynest an euyl custum. ?yf a cursed man hadde cumpany with one or ouþer, logh or hy, Or yn mete or yn drynke At þe alehous, or ouþer gaderyng, He ne wulde recche how long he lay yn hys cursyng, ny?t or day. For holy cherchë curseþ none But yn vnbuxumnesse þat haþ mysgone; Þat wyl nat stonde at hys Iustyse, he defendyþ hym þe comune acyse, For to make hym be ashamed Þat he shulde be so defamed, And so shulde he wyte he may nat be But at holy cherche degre. For swych þyng, men ofte hem meken, And mercy at holy cherchë sekyn. Þarfor hyt ys a grete folye, with cursed man haue cumpanye.

[Against making Men drunk.] Þys custum ys also perylous, To lede a man to þe alehous To do hym drynke out of resun, Or make hym drunke,—þat ys tresun,— Or to þy hous, ?yf þou hym lede, On hym drynkë for to bede; Þou art gylty of hys synne ?yf þou to drunkenes wldest hym wynne. And ?yf þou ioyë þerof has, Þe more þou fallyst yn trespas; Hyt ys a tokene of felunnye To weytë hym with swych gylrye.

Anoþer spyce ys yn glotonye, To ete ouer delycyusly, For to be serued with many messe: Þat haunte þese lordyngës on dese.on table wuld þey of euery a messe ?yue To helpe þe pore wyþ for to lyue, Þe boldlyere þey my?t hem self fede ?yf þey dedyn þat almës dede. But of almës þenk þey no?t, For lust and lykyng ys more yn þoght. Þou þat louest so many messe, wuldest þou þenke on syre Dyues, And of þe porë man La?are Þat syre Dyues late mysfare,— For he asked hym sum gode, Of hys mete, for hys lyuës fode,— y trowe þou shuldest nat forgete Þe pore man at þy mete, ?yf þou vndyrstode, y wene, what þe talë wulde bemene. [The Tale of Dives and Lazarus.] A ryche man was sum tyme of prys Þat wered boþe purpure and bys, And euery day nobly was led, And with delycyus metys fed; And þer was þo a porë man, Lazare, þat þe wurd of ran, He lay at þe ryche mannys ?ate, Ful of bylës, yn þe gate;wey He ?erned moche to ete hys fylle Of þe crummes þat þe ryche man ded spyl, But no man ?aue hym on to byte, Þogh þat asked he so lyte: But þe rychë mannës houndes Come and lykked La?ares woundes. Sone aftyrward deydë La?are Before þe mannes ?atë þare; Goddës aungeles þe soulë nam, And bare hyt yn-to þe bosum of Abraham. Abrahams bosum ys a dwellyng Þat holy men haue yn restyng, Þat to Ihesu, Goddys sone, cam, Þat flesshe and blode yn Mary nam. Abrahams bosum ys a stede, men telle, Betwyxë paradys and helle. Fyl auenture, as y er seyde, Þys rychë man sone aftyr deyde. Hys soule was bore to Lucyfere, with-outyn ende to dwellë þere; And, as he was þere yn pyne, He loked vpwarde with hys yne, And sagh La?are, þe porë man, yn þe bosum of Abraham; And as he my?t, he ?aue a cry, And seyd, “Abraham, mercy, mercy! Late La?are hys o fynger wete, And, droppe on my tunge for hete; For y am yn endles peyne, yn fyre and yn leye certeyne.” And Abraham spak as yn vpbreyde, “Sone! menest þou nat what y er seyd? Þou receyuedyst þe wurldys blys, And La?are, pouert and peyne ywys. Þou ete and drunke, and were ful blyþe; And La?are hungred, &amp; ful wo syþe; And now shal he, for hys deserte, Haue welþe y-nogh for hys pouert; And þou, for welþe, to pyne shal go, And for þy ryches þou shalt haue wo. Now ys La?are euer yn solace, And þou yn sorow with-outë grace; Þe endles ende may no man telle Betwyxe vs here, &amp; ?ow yn helle; Betwyxe oure ioye, and ?ourë peyne, ys endles tyme, and vncerteyne. Swych sykernes ys betwyx ?ow two, Þat noun of vs to ?ow may go. None of vs to ?ow may come, But echone haue hys ownë dome.” Þan preyde þe ryche man, Abraham, þat he wlde sende Lazare, or sum oþer wham, To hys breþryn allë fyue, Þat þey loke hem so, yn here lyue, Fro auaryce and fro glotonye And ?yue to porë men bleþlye, “Þat þey neuer hedyr be sent, with me, yn þys hete, to be brent.” Abraham ne graunted hym noght Þat þe ryche man hym besoght, “Þey haue,” he seyd, “alle þe prophete dedys, And holy wryt, þat men on redys, To teche hem boþë ry?t and skyle, Do þeraftyr, ?yf þey wyle.” Þan spake þe rychë man, “Nay, fadyr Abraham, nay, þey ne kan; But wuldest þou do aftyr my rede, To reyse a man þat haþ be dede, þat my?t hem þe peynës telle Þat þey shul suffre and yn dwelle, Þan shulde þey do ry?t penaunce For to askapë þys myschaunce.” Abraham wulde nat graunte Þe ryche man þat cunnaunt, A dedë man vp for to reyse, “Syn Moyses sawes þey wyl nat preyse, How wulde þey at a dede man lere, whan holy wryt þey wyl nat here?” Þys tale tellyþ oure lorde Ihesu To rychë men for herë prew, Þat þey ne be no nythyng Of here mete, ne of here þyng. To porë men, namëly, Þat þou ?yuest hem, ?yue hyt bleþly, with no betyng, ne with noun awe; Almës ys no?t wyþ any myssawe. why tellyþ he þe wykkednes of þys man alle,— And he ne robbed, ne he ne stalle,— But for he bare hym ouer hye, And ledde hys lyfe yn glotonye, And to þe pore dyd euyl yn dede, No halp hym no?t yn hys nede: Ne La?are asked nat greuuslyke, But a fewe crummës for to pyke; And for he ?aue hym noun on to byte, Hym was werned as lyte: As lytyl as he hym wernede, As lytyl þyng he ?ernede; he preydë La?are hym to sende A dropë of hys fynger ende. Loke how euene Iugement, Þe tone a?ens þe toþer, was sent: hyt ys but a lytyl synne, Of a drope and of a crumme; þan wyl hyt be ful harde a-counte Of þyng þat wylle to moche a-mounte. Þarfor, ?e lordyngys, beþ ful ware, Þenkeþ on Dyues and on La?are, And þe porë na?t forgete whan ?e syttë at ?oure mete. And þou þat fedyst þe so rychely, Ouer mesure yn glotonye, Þenk þat þou shalt stynk and rote, And wurmës shul fyl þy þrote, And þe fouler shal þy body stynke, For thy ryche metë, and þy drynke. Euery man ?yue tente to þys, And se how vyle hys body ys. Twey dayys or þre mow hyt lokekepe Mete, ar man hyt ete or toke; But as sone as hyt ys yn þe ?oten, Yn half a day þan ys hyt roten; Ry?t vyle, and alþer meste, Þan hyt ys of any ouþer beste. Se weyl þys! þan mayst þou fynde, how vyle þan ys þyn ownë kynde. Þys rychë man that y of telle, Wente nat oonly þarfor to helle, But, for þat he wuldë noght ?yue to La?are þat he besoght, Ne no?t only for glotonye, Ne auaryce, ne for beryng hye, No?t for-þy, þe leste of þys, My?t brynge a man to Iuwys. why was God moste wyþ hym wroth? For he dyd þe pore man loth,harme And for he dyd hys houndes oute late To byte þe La?are at þe ?ate; And, for he dyde hym þat dyspyte, God wrathede hym astyte, And deyneþ nat to nemne hys name, For he dede þe pore man shame, But calleþ hym yn þe gospel, ryche, As vnkyndë and vnbryche. For ful comunly shalt þou fynde Oftë rychë men vnkynde. Lorde! how shul þese robbers fare, Þat þe pore pepyl pelyn ful bare,— Erlës, kyn?tës, and barouns, And ouþer lordyngës of tounnes; Iustyses, shryues, and baylyuys, Þat þe lawës alle to-ryues, And þe pore men alle to-pyle; To ryche men do þey but as þey wylle. Þys ryche man, as þe gospel seys, was but to .o. man vncurteys, And hadde so mochë pyne þarfore; On hem wyl fallë mochë more Þat many pore men pyle and bete, For God no synne wyl þey nat lete. Swych ryche men þat are a?ens Goddys pes, Þenkeþ on La?are and on Dyues; And beþ nat pynede wyþ Satanas For porë men, as Dyues was, And ys, and euer shal be; ?yt robbed he neuer golde ne fee. By þys skylle, þan mow ?e se, Þat ?e are wers þan was he. He dyde but lete an hounde hym to; ?e rychë men, weyl wers ?e do! ?e wyl noun houndës to hem lete, But, ?e self, hem sle and bete. He ne dyd but werned hym of hys mete; And ?e, robbe al þat ?e mow gete; ?e are as Dyues, þat wyl naght ?yue; And wers, for ?e robbe þat þey shulde by lyue. Of mochë peyne ?e mow ?ow drede, For ?e do weyl wers þan Dyues dede. ?e rychë men, God wyl ?ow charge Þat ?e ?yue ?oure almës large; Nat ouer powere, neuer a deyl, But ?yue þat, þat ?e mow ful weyl; And nat allonely largëly, But with loue, þat ys, curtesy; ?yueþ curteysly, and nat to bete, ?ow were bettyr ?oure almës lete. ?yf a pore man take ons or twyys, Mysdo hym nat, ?yf þou be wys, Ne seye hym noun oþer vyleynye; Þan doust þou larges and curteysye. More þank þou getest for swych ?yuyng Þan seuene so moche with chydyng. Herefore Seynt Ihon þe aumenere seys, And techyþ men to be curteys. [The Tale of St. John the Almoner, and his great Liberality and Courtesy.] Hyt seyþ Seynt Ihon þe aumenere Pore men called hym Goddys spensere; He was bysshope and patryarke Of Constantynë, noble starke. Of hym ?ede ful fyr þe name, Of large almës men ?aue hym name. A pylgryme herde of hym þus seye, And to hys palys he toke þe weye; whan he cam þer, he sagh seynt Ihon Dele þe pore folk ful gode wone; He seyd he wulde hym ouercharge, To wete wheþer seynt Ihon were large. He com, and asked þe charyte, And seynt Ihon, þat was so fre, He commaundede hys seriaunte For to ?yue hym syxe besaunte. Þys pylgrym ?ede and chaunged hys wede, More to aske, ?yf he my?t spede. And seyd he hadde goun many a gate, And to þe cyte he was com late, And of spensys had he non, So hadde he yn pylgrymage gon. Seynt Ihon commaundede hys aumenere To ?yue hym ouþer syxe, for he had mystere.nede Þe aumener parceyued weyl þat tyme Þat hyt was þe same pylgryme Þat toke byfore þe charyte, And seyd, “syre, þys ys he.” Noþeles, oþer wroth or glad, He ?af hym, þat seyn Ihon bad. Þys pylgrym eft besydë nam,?ede And eftë þe þryd tymë cam yn a-noþer wede þan he was ore, And asked at seynt Ihon ?yt more. Þe aumenere was wroth þerfore, Þat he asked so oute of skore, Syn hym was ?yue so largëly, And ?yt he asked, and was gredy. But Seynt Ihon, he was fre, And yn ful gretë charyte He commaunded to hym a-none To ?yue hym twelue besauntes echone: “Peráuenture, God wyl me proue what y wyl do for hys loue, Oþer hyt ys God hym selue; Þarfore ?yf hym besauntes twelue; Or he proueþ me a-noþer wey, ?yf y wyl any of hys myssey; Þarfore ?yueþ with godë wyl And curteysye, with-outyn yl.” Þys tale y toldë ?ow þys tyde, Þat ?e with no pore men chyde; ?yf þou chydyng with hym makes, whan þyn almes of þe he takes, He byeþ hyt dere with hys myssawe, And shame þerwith, and drede, and awe. ?yf for þat ?yft þou wylt haue mede, Mysdo hym nat, yn wurde ne dede. Also hyt ys grete curteysye To ?yue ?oure almës hastylye; Nat for to makë long delay, To late a wrecchë stonde al day Cryyng at þy ?ate yn colde; He byeþ þyn almes on manyfolde, And þogh þou ?yue hym lytyl or noght, Algate hyt ys dere y-boghte. And, þarfore hyt were weyl doun To ?yue þyn almës gladly and soun. And y warne ?ow alle of o þyng, Forþenkeþ nat of ?oure almes-?yuyng. ?yf þou forþenkest, þou getyst maugre, Þy ?yft ys nat yn charyte; Ryght so dyd þe bysshope Troyle, For hys almes he made grete doyle,sorowe Þat a sykenes hym ouer haf For largë almes þat he ?af. Seynt Ihoun þe aumenere telleþ how, And as he seyþ, y shal telle ?ow; A gode ensample, as we rede, Þat none forþynke hys almës dede. [The Tale of Bishop Troylus and his Thirty Pounds.] Þys yche seynt Ihon þe aumenere was a patryark of grete powere; Vndyr hym was bysshope Troylus, Þat for to haue tresour was coueytous. And on a day, as fyl to be Þat seynt Ihon ?af hys charyte, Þe bysshope Troylë, for cumforte, with hym wentë for dysporte, To se þe folk þat þyrdyr come Of many cuntres þat oute were nome. Þat ychë tyme þat chaunce gan falle, Seynt Ihon hadde nat to ?yue hem alle; But a man, þat was þere, Rouned yn seynt Ihons ere. ‘Þat he hadde broght þat ychë stoundetyme To syre Troylë þyrty pounde, And he my?t helpë, ?yf he wylde, Þat hys dolë were fulfylde.’ Seynt Ihon to Troyle bygan to sermunto speke with ensamples of gode resun, “Þat he hadde pyte of here cryyng; To se hem wepe, was reuful þyng; For God shal þanke alle at þe laste day yn dede, Þat of þe pore for hys loue han pyte at nede. what ys hyt wrþ to preche yn cherche, whan men yn dedë wyl nat werche? And now hyt ys so on þy party, Thou hast besauntes of golde redy, Þat þou mayst helpe, ?yf þat þou wylt, Þat þys pore peple be nat spylt.” what for almes, and what for despyte, Troylë commaunded al styte Þat þo þrytty pounde of golde were ?yue þere seynt Ih?? wolde. To þe pore was hyt so delte and dryue, Þat euery besaunt was furþ ?yue. whan allë haddë þat þere cam, Seynt Ih?? and Troylë homward nam: Troyle fyl yn a grete syknes For sorow of hys large almes; Þat sorow hadde hym so ouercome, Þat þe feuer hadde hym nome. He wende weyl þat he hadde be lore, So lytyl hope yn hym was bore. Hys godë hopë was ful badde, For hym þoghte lore, þat pore men hadde. Seynt Ihon wulde nat Troyle forgete, He sente aftyr hym to þe mete; But he excused hym, and seyd nay, And seyd þat he yn þe feuer lay, And to þe deþe he hoped weyl, Þarefore ne my?t he come þat sele.þat tyme whan Seynt Ihon herde þat seye, Þat Troyle supposed for to deye, Asswyþë to hym he ?ede, And cunseyled hym to haue no drede; “Drede þe noght, my godë sone, Goddës manere we owe to kone; For alle þo þat he loueþ dere, he chasteþ hem on many manere; And as he sendeþ to þè, sykenes, He wyl sende hele whan hys wyl es.” Seynt Ihon wyst wele hys herte, Hys sykënes, and alle hys querte; Þarfore he seydë on þys wyse— For he knew hys coueytyse,— “Þy golde þat was to me so redy, To me þou lentyst hyt, graunte mercy; For y was yn wyl, for þe feste, Þat euery hadde a peny, who so hadde leste. But y my?t nat so of myne, But y hadde borowed at þe of þyne; Þo þrytty pounde, God haþ me sente, And here þey are now, þy presente; And asswyþe þey shul be payd, No lenger shul þey be delayd.” Seynt Ihon called hys chaumberleyn, And tolde hem to Troyle, be summe certeyn. Anoun cumforted was Troyle so weyl Þat hys sykenes he forgate eche deyl, And so smartly, yn tyme so lyte, Þat þey allë my?t wele wyte Þat þe feuer þat hym so shoke was for þe monye þat he toke. He dyde on hys cloþys astyte, And to Seynt Ihon he wrote a skryte; Þys skryt conteyneþ, as hyt seyþ þore, Þese samë wurdës, lesse ne more: “God þe ?elde, my lorde Syre Ihon, Þe besauntes þat were delte echon, Þat y lente þe, þrytty pounde, Yn hande y haue hem hole and sounde.” And Troyle dyde þe skryt weyl sele, And syþen ros vp yn gode hele; And went hym homë with seynt Ihon; Of euyl felte he no more non. But Ihesu, þat seëþ al þyng, Shewed to Troyle þys tokenyng How he hadde lore a rychë holde, And for auaryce he hyt solde. Troyle tolde, he sagh þys syght At þe fyrst slepe of þe nyght: Hym was shewed a paleys, So fayre was neuer noun, hyt seys; For alle hyt was of betyn golde, Alle þat euer stode on molde. My?te no man aymë þe largenesse, Ne tungë tellë þe feyrnesse. Þer-yn was so noble atyre, Shynyng as golde, flammyng as fyre. Aboute þe ?atë wrytyn was Þat Troyle beheldë a long space, And ofte he reddë þat wrytyng, And haddë þeryn grete lykyng; Þys was þere wryte,—as seynt Ihon telles, And as men of þys story spellys,— “Reste and hous with-outyn ende, Þe bysshope Troylë shal to wende.” Þus þoght Troylë yn hys bedde, As he ofte on þe lettyr redde. Þan wende Troylë sykyrly weyl, Þe kyng hadde ?yue hyt hym eche deyl; Þarefore syre Troylë was ful gladde Þat he swyche a paleys hadde. Vnneþë þenne hys y?e was glent, Þat one fro God þydyr was sent, And commaunded alle yn rapehaste A-wey þat wrytyng for to skrape. Alle þat spakë of syre Troyle was skraped a-wey, as who sey oyle. Sone aftyrward, with-yn a lytyl, was þere wryte anoþer tytyl; Þys tytyl þat was latter wryte, Þus moche hyt ys for to wyte, “Rest, and hous, and wonyng, Graunteþ, and ?yueþ, heuene kyng, To Ihon þe patryark so fre, with-outyn ende yn ioye to be, For þrytty poundë þat he boghte, And to almës dede hem broghte.” And Troylë waked sone anone, And tolde hys dremë to seynt Ihon, Euery deyl how he hadde sen, And was ordeyned to haue ben. “Þarfore,” he seyde, “fro henne forward Ne shal y neuer be to pore man hard; So feyre ys dy?te to hem to lyue, Þat blely wyl to pore men ?yue.” But algate Troyle þat tyme had tynte Þe fyrst paleys þat God hadde hym mynte. ?e lordynges þat haue y-now, Þys talë haue y tolde for ?ow, Þat ?e ne repente ?ow of largés Þat ?e ?yue to ?oure almés; And þenkeþ on þe bysshope Troyle Þat for large almës made grete doyle, Þat ?e ne lese nat þat paleys Þat God ordeyneþ to alle curteys; For who so ?yueþ curteysly, Hyt fordoþe þe synne of glotonye. Of mete, glotonye wyl bygynne; Almës þerof fordoþe þat synne. Almës fordoþ alle wykkednes, And quenchyþ synne, and makyþ hyt les. Almës semeþ hyt cumþ of loue Þat þou ?yuest to man for God aboue, Oþer for hym þat þou ?yuest þore, Or hym þat þou ?yuest hyt fore. Almës, þou wost weyl, ys a ?yfte; And for þe ?yuyng, man ys vplyfte. ?yue gladly, for God, þyn almës here; Hym ?yue þou hyt on alle manere, And for hys loue, to hys meyne, ?yf þou of hym wylt loued be. So wyl ?yftys louë tylle, And gadyr many one to gode wylle. For ?yftys, twey loues mayst þou haue, And boþe be tymës mow þe saue. Þe fyrst ys, ?yf þou ?yue þy þynges To hauë louë of lordynges: For þy ?yfte þou mayst be herde, And saue þy godë yn þe werlde; But þat love lasteþ lytyl whyle, And a?ens God hyt wyl þe fyle. Þe toþer loue is noght for þys; Hyt askeþ noght but heuene blys; And þat loue ys, euery deyl, loue of God and pore man weyl. what ys loue vnto men pore? Almës to hem ys recouere; Almës dede of loue ys wey, Noþer mysdo, noþer myssey; Þan wyl God almyghty loue þe; Þy loue ys þan with charyte. Charyte ys, þe certeyn to lere, loue of þyn euyncrysten dere. So sone þerto, noght wyl þe lede, Ne so moche, as wyl almës dede. Charyte ys, þe longyng of loue, As y haue tolde ?ow here aboue; For alle þat euer þou mayst do,— But loue yn charyte be þerto— Alle þat euer hast þou wroght, Stant þe ellës al at noght. Se now what seynt Poulë seys Yn a pystyl, þe samë weys,— “Þogh y speke as weyl with tung As any man or aungel haþ song, And y lyue nat with charyte, No þyng auayleþ hyt to me. For y do þan ry?t as þe bras, And as þe tympan, þat bete was; Þe bras, to oþer, ?yueþ grete sown, And bet hym self vp and down. And þogh y speke al yn prephecye, And haue þe kunnyng of euery maystrye, And, with gode beleue myght seye Þe hylles to turne yn-to þe valey, ?yf hyt ne be with charyte wroght, Ellës, he seyþ þat y am noght. Þogh y ?yue alle my wurldës gode Vnto porë mennys fode, And ?yue my body for to brenne Opunly oþer men to kenne,teche But ?yf þar be charyte with alle, My mede þarfore shal be ful smalle.” loke now how many godenesse þer are, with-outë charyte noght but bare. wylt þou know þy self, and se ?yf þou wone yn charyte? Charyte suffreþ boþe gode and yl, And charyte ys of reuful wyl, Charyte haþ noun enuye, And charyte wyl no felunnye; Charyte ys nat Irus,wraþful And charyte ys nat coueytous; Charyte wyl no bostful preysyng; he wyl noght but ry?twys þyng; Charyte loueþ no fantome, No þynges þat euyl may of come; He haþ no ioye of wykkednes, But loueþ alle þat sothfast es; Alle godenes he vp bereþ; Alle he suffreþ, and noun he dereþ; Gode hope he haþ yn ryghtwys þyng, And alle he susteyneþ to þe endyng; Charyte ne fayleþ noght, Ne no þyng þat with hym ys wroght. when alle prophecyes are alle gone, And alle tunges are leyde echone, And alle craftys fordo shul be, Þan lasteþ stedfast charyte.” Þus seyþ seynt Poule, and mochë more, Yn hys pystyl of hys lore. Seynt charyte ys gode and hende, lastyng with God with-outyn ende. Gode hyt were to loue hyt weyl, And folowe hyt with oure dede sumdeyl. ?yf we þys charyte wyl haue, ?yue we þe pore whan þey vs craue; ?yue we hem, as hyt ys oure my?t, with-oute myssaw or any fy?t; Þan ys hyt curteys almës dede; Þank of God þan ys oure mede, And shal stonde ful stalwurþly A?ens þe synne of glotonye, As y haue tolde ?ow here byfore, And furþer shal y telle ?ow now more. At þe begynnyng y spake of þys, Ete ne drynk but þat nede ys. who so doþ hyt oute of mesure, Hele of body may nat dure, And to hys soule, hyt ys dedly synne, Þat custummable ys þer-ynne; And penaunce harde þarfore shal go, But we kepe vs weyl þerfro. Loke yn þys sawe what Catoun seys, Þat ys wyys and ry?t curteys, “?yf þou yn hele wylt dure, Ete and drynk of swych mesure Þat þy strenkþe be nat þe lesse; For, drynkyng oute of skylle, Þy body bryng hyt wylle To sorowe and to sykënesse.” And ouþer spyces haþ glotonye: To ete þy mete ouer brennynglye And lustly, whan þou hyt getyst, And takest noun hede what þou etyst. Anoþer spyce ys noght to pay, As a beste to ete al day, And kepyst nonë certeyn tyme, Þe settyng at none or pryme, Noþer ouþer tyme þat fallyþ to man, But as a beste þat no resun kan. Me þenkeþ weyl hyt ys resun To callë swych a man ‘glotoun.’ Twyys on þe day ys sustynaunce To man þat haþ gode cheuysaunce. Þe cheuysauncë, woste þou how, To man þat haþ metë ynow, Þogh he be man of trauayle, Hyt were y-now with-outë fayle. But þo men þat haue no swynk, Þat delyte hem yn mete or drynk, Þe apostyl Poulë spekþ of þo, And dampneþ many one to wo. He seyþ “woo to þo þat erly ?erne, Þat go and hauntë þe tauerne, Yn wyne or ale to haue lykyng; Cursednes hem folowyþ at þe endyng. Of swych, here wombës are here Cryst; Þat ys here loue, þat ys here tryst.” Alle þys he meneþ sykyrly For man þat loueþ moche glotonye. ?ungë chyldryn, þey mow wele, On þe day, etë þre mele; For sum of hem wex ful tyte, Þarefor ys more, here appetyte; And ?yt behoueþ tyme be þar-to, Or men mowe wyþ hem mysdo; For, þus seyþ þe oldë man Yn a prouerbe þat he can, “?yue þy chylde when he wyl kraue, And þy whelpe whyl hyt wyl haue, Þan mayst þou make yn a stounde A foulë chylde and a feyrë hounde.” So mayst þou be enchesoun To make þy chylde a glotoun. A-nouþer vyce ys ?yt to graunte, Þat rychë men mochyl haunte, Þat many one are so daungerous, And oute of mesure esquaymous, Þat hys kokë may no day Greyþë hym hys mete to pay. Þat me þenkeþ a feble manere; A vylanye hyt ys to here; For euery coke wulde, at hys my?t, hys lordës metë were wel dy?t: wheþer hyt be lorde or lady, Me þenkeþ hyt ys a spyce of glotonye. hyt semeþ, were hyt at þy wyl, Ouer mesure þou wuldest þe fyl. Rerë sopers yn pryuyte, with glotonye, echone þey be; And þyr ys mochë wastë ynne, And gadryng of ouþer synne. Þefte behoueþ þe sumdele þore, And glotonye algatë more; And leccherye ys quene or kyng; For hym ys all þat gaderyng. ?yt are þer ouþer rere sopers, with men þat seruë kny?tys and squyers; For al þe day þan wyl þey be Before here maysters yn soberte; But whan here maysters are broght to bedde, Þan wyl þey fonde þat þey be fedde, And sytte vp þare wyþ recolage And ?yt do mochë more outrage; To þe mydnyght ys but a þrowe, But hyt be, tyl þe cok krowe. Þese men are clumbë on a grece To glotonyë with þat spece. Also fallë men yn plyght, Þat sytte vp þe Þursday at nyght. And ouerlong ete flesshe and drunke Aftyr þat mydnyght ys runge, Or fysshe or flesshe þat suffreþ dede, Þat shulde on þe Fryday faste watyr &amp; brede; Swych etyng þey shul sore abeye, But þey amende hem are þey deye. Þe Fryday nyght ys,—þys shalt þou leue,— Aftyr þe Þursday at eue; Þe nyght cumþ byfore þe day, Þat ys now of þe newë lay. As y haue tolde of rere sopers, Þe same falleþ of erly dyners; Dyners are oute of skyl and resun On þe Sunday, or hye messe be doun. Þogh þou haue haste, here ?yt a messe, Al holy, and no lesse, And nat symple, a sakare, For hyt ys nat y-now for þe, But hyt be for lordys powere, Or pylgrymage þat haþ no pere. Are þou oght ete, þys ys my rede, Take holy watyr and holy brede; For yn auenture kas, hyt may þe saue, ?yf housel ne shryftë þou mayst haue. Alle oþer tymes ys glotonye, But hyt be grete enchesun why. On oþer hygh dayys, ?yf þat þou may,— Þogh þat hyt be nat Sunday,— Here þy messë ar þou dyne; ?yf þou do nat, ellys ys hyt pyne. lordës þat haue prestes at wyl, Me þenketh þey trespas ful yl, Þat any day ete, are þey here messe, But ?yf hyt be þurgh harder dystresse. þe men þat are of holy cherche, Þey wetë weyl how þey shul werche; But swych y tellë hardyly, Þat swych a preste douþ glotonye, Þat leuyþ hys messe on þe auter For to go to a dyner. So ne shuld he do, for no þyng, For loue ne awe of no lordyng, But ?yf hyt were for a grete nede Þat shuld hym falle, or a grete drede. Now haue we tolde yn lytyl space how þat glotonye cumþ yn place On many maner dyuers wyse, And how we shul knowe allë þyse. ?yf any seþ hym so coupáble Þat yn þys ys custummáble, leuë hem, and do no more, And askë penauncë þarefore, And God ys curteys, and wul wele For?yue þe þy trespas euery dele. God graunte vs, for hys swete mercy, To kepe vs alle fro glotonye! [Of Lechery.] Now shul we speke of leccherye, Þat foloweþ þe synne of glotonye; Hyt ys þe laste of seuene, And, fyrþest hyt ys fro heuene. wharefore þan hyt ys so? For hyt dampneþ euer two. Þou mayst synne þy self yn wyl, But with anoþer þou shalt fulfyl. Forsoþe þey are to folehardy Þat haunte þe synne of lecchery; For why, to do alle ouþer synnes, Þe lyghtlyer þe fende hem wynnes. On seuene maners shal y shewe How lecherye þan ys a shrewe. Þe fyrst ys ‘fornycacyon,’ whan two vnweddyd haue mysdon, As sengle knaue and sengle tarne,wenche. whan þey synne to-gedyr ?erne; Þe leste hyt ys of allë seuene, ?yt hyt forbarreþ þe blys of heuene. Þe touþer ys ‘awoutry,’ whan weddyd and weddyd to-gedyr lye, As weddyd man takeþ anoþers wyfe, Þat ys þe morë synful lyfe. ?yf weddyd man, sengle woman takeþ, Forsoþe spousebrechë þere he makyþ. ?yf weddyd wyfe take sengle man, Alle spousebreche tel y hyt þan; For þey haue broke with-outë fayle Þe chastë bondë of spousayle. Þe þryddë synnë ys þe werst, Þe clerk[es] calleþ hyt ‘yncest,’ whan men take kyn yn felawrede, And wyþ hem doþ flesshëly dede; Þe ner[ë] syb she ys hys kynde, Þe morë ply?t shal he þere fynde. Or ?yf he with a woman synne, Þat sum of hys kyn haþ endyd ynne, Þat ys to sey, haþ ley here by, Þe more ply?t ys þat lecchery; Þus hyt seyþ yn þe decre, He calleþ hyt an ‘affynyte’; Affynyte hyt makeþ alle an ende, hys blode þarto no more may wende. Þe fourþe synne ys more perylous, with man and womman relygyus; ?yf þey haue made professyoun Boþe vn-to relygyoun, Moche ys to chargë þat folye ?yf þey to-gedyr do leccherye. Relygyous man also ys to blame, Þat yn þe wurlde takeþ a foule fame, For he may kepe hym weyl þerfro, Alonë þar hym neuer go. Þe fyfþe ys mochë for to drede, To rauysh a womman here maydenhede, Þat ys to say, a-?ens here wylle, But ?yf she grauntë weyl þar-tylle; And, þogh she to hym consente, he ys holde to here auaunsement; For ?yf she ?yue here to folye, She kan nat leuë tyl she deye; And he þat broght here to þat bysmere, For here foly he shal answere. Þe syxtë reyseþ gretë stryfe, To rauys anouþer mannys wyfe; For a?ens God hyt ys euyl dede, And to þe worlde also mochyl drede. ?yf hyt be a?ens here wyl, Þe more he douþ hym seluen yl. A clerk, ?yf [þat] he ordred be, hys synne ys more þan ouþer þre For he douþ þat he shulde forbede, And chastyse ouþer of swyche dede, And þarto mochyl morë kan Þan a-noþer lewed man. Þou lewed man, knowest also what ys to lete, what ys to do; Þou knowyst as weyl, euery poynt, As þe prest þat ys a-noynt, And wost what peryl ys þerynne; Þou mayst no?t sey, to fende þy synne. Also do þesë lordynges, Þey trespas mochë yn twey þynges; Þey rauys a mayden a?ens here wyl, And mennys wyuys þey lede awey þertyl; A grete vylanye þarto he dous ?yf he make þerof hys rous;boste Þe dedë ys confusyun, And more ys þe dyffamacyun. Þe seuenest ys foulest leccherye— Comoun wymmen to lyggë by— Of al þe ouþer þat we haue seyde. longyng of loue ys þerë nede, For to louë one a-lone, Þan here þat tak[e]þ euerychone. Foul ys þat lust and þat peryl, To loue here þat al men go tyl. Ful foulë ys þat forreyne Þat ys comon for al, certeyne; Þerfore, what as euer be yn þy þoght, Comun wymmen take þou noght, For many kas þat may falle, Þat pryuë ys to telle ?ow alle. And somë toldë mow weyl be, Þat are nat holde yn pryuyte; One ys, she may take þy broþer, Fadyr, or sybkynd, as wel as ouþer. Anoþer, for cuntek and foule stryfe, Þou mayst, þurgh here, lese þy lyfe. Þe þred[dë] ys þe werstë wem; Meseles, men seye, vsen hem; And, who takeþ hem yn þat hete, Clennesse of body he may sone lete. Moche wo þan, ys swyche to take, For þesë þre lakkës sake; And moche may be þat wommans mone, For she shal answere for hem echone Þat haue ydo any synne wyþ hyre, At domes day, þe day of Ire. Þarefore, ?e men, takeþ none, Ne ?e wymmen, takeþ but one. ?yf man or womman may nat be chaste, Take, and do no morë waste, One of whom ?oure loue wyl be, And ?yueþ nat ?oure bodyys to alle ylych fre. Seuene maner synnes y haue ?ow tolde, Þe whych cumbren men on many folde, And þe leste of alle þese seuene Forbarreþ a man þe blys of heuene. who-so wyl be clene of þyse, A?ens hys flessh behoueþ hym ryse, And wyþ hyt fy?t ful faste Þat hyt be algate dowün kaste, And elles may he neuer be clene, hys flessh hys enmy wyl hym sone tene: Of swych a fy?t a sample y kan, Of seynt Benet þat holy man. Seynt Gregory telþ for þe nones how seynt Benet was tempted onys. [The Tale of St. Benet's Temptation, and how he freed himself by rolling in Thorns and Nettles.] As seynt Benet sate yn hys celle, To tempte hym com a fend of helle Yn a lykenes of a bryd. A ‘þrostyl’ ys þe namë kyd; hyt come fleyng by seynt Benet, And, mery synggyng, by hym hym set; Noþeles, he hadde grete ferlywundyr Þat hyt flegh hym so ny. Seynt Benet wende he my?t hyt ha take, For hyt sate by hym so spake.tame he blessed hym fyrst, and bedde hys hande To take þe brydde þat was syttande; As sone as he hadde made þe croyce, Þe bryde flegh furþ, and left hys voys. Þat þrostel sagh he no more; hyt become, he ne wyst whore. Þan come on hym so sodenly So grete temptyng of lecchery, Þat neuer er, syn he was bore, So grete temptyng was hym byfore; Þe fendë þan put yn hys þoght Þat he hadde, or seye, or wroght. Onës he sagh a feyre womman, And al day yn hys þoght she ran; Swych þoght so hadde hym ouercome, Þat þe þoght of God, hyt had ny fornome; And foule longyng had hym so take Þat hys ermytage he hadde nygh forsake; But Ihesu, þat seeþ al þyng, he sagh weyl hys grete temptyng; Þogh he suffred hym weyl be to-blaste, he suffred hym nat be dowün kaste; Þe fende may nat but tempte þy wyl, Þe selfe behoueþ þe dede fulfyl; And for he stode so stalwrþly, Þe holy goste was to hym redy. with-oute hys cellë, þornës wore, And netles grewe, þat byten sore; So haddë grace made hym stedfaste, Þat al hys cloþys of he kast, And alle naked hym-self he wrappe Among þe þornës þat were sharpe, And among þe netles echone, Tyl hys temptacyun was al gone. Þe þornes prykked, þe netles dyd byte, Of flesshly temptacyun þey made hym quyte, So clene, þat neuer aftyrward was he tempted more so hard Of hys flessh, þat was hys fo, he dyde hyt þere so mochë wo. Seþþen, loued he Ihesu cryst wel more Þan he dede, euer byfore, And hadde to hym more loue longyng Þan byfore hys hard temptyng. Þys tale y tolde for þat enchesun, To stand a?ens temptacyun; For who-so wyl hys soulë saue, Many a fy?t behoueþ hym haue A?ens þe spyces of lecchery, Ar he wynne of hym þe maystry. Seynt Poule techyþ vs for þat batayle A sykyr fyght þat wyl nat fayle; He seyþ, “y forbede ?ow echoun, with womman for to go alone.” For who-so douþ hyt, sone and ly?tly He consentyþ to lecchery; Þou alone, alone with hyre, þy þoght, by herte, cumþ sone on fyre; Be þou neuer so chaste ne straunge, Be ?e alone, þyn herte wyl chaunge; And God commaundeþ boþe þe and me, Oure herte to stable yn chastyte. He seyþ nat, to whom he wyl kalle, But spekeþ comunly to vs alle; And þogh he calle alle comunly, Sum are called more specyally; For specyaly þat comandeþ he To men þat are of hygh degre, As to bysshopes, and persones, To prestys, and ouþer relygyons; To þese ys specyal comaundement; Þurgh þese to ouþer hyt shal be sent. Þarefore he byddeþ, with wurdës smarte, Þat þey be allë chaste of herte. what ys hyt wurþ to be, with-outen, clene, whan fylþë ys withynne þe sene? For many one, whan þey to bedde are bro?t, Delyten hem yn fylþys of þoght. Swych þoghtës are synnës greue, ?yf þey þè pay, or be þè leue; And ?yf hyt pay þè so, swych foule þo?t, Þat þe dede were do, ?yf þou moght, Certes hyt ys nat to drede Þat þy wyl ne shal answere for þe dede. For ?yf þou my?tyst, þou wuldest, do, Þy wyl consenteþ weyl þarto; Þou art a lechoure yn þat kas, Þyn hertëwyl ys grete trespas.

[The Tale of the Jew who heard some Devils' Reports of their Deeds to Satan; and how the Devil who got a Bishop to pat a Nun on the Back was most praisd.] Seynt Gregory telleþ, for gode mennys prew, Þat sum tyme was onës a Iew, And trauayled o tyme by þe cuntre, By iurnes þydyr þat he wulde be. Fyl so, he nyghtede yn a wasteyne, Þere he sagh no stede certeyne; he sagh no stede where wast best To lygge a nyght and take hys rest. But an olde temple he sagh stondyng, þat, sum tyme, folke mysbeleuyng Made here sacrifyse þer-ynne To here god, þat hyght Apolyne; Þys Iew restede þere þat ny?t, And toke hys esë as he my?t. As þe Iew lay þere alone, To hym-self he made hys mone, Þat he beleued on swych a lawe Þat my?t nat saue hym on no sawe. Of Ihesu Cryst, he hadde herd speke, How Iewes dyd hym on þe rodë steke. Þurgh grete þan ynspyracyun, He þoght so on hys passyun Þat oure feyþ yn hys hertë ran, Al be hyt he were no crysten man; So, what for trouþe, and what for doute, He made þe croys hym al a-boute, And seþþen leyd hym downe to slepe; Of ouþer, ?af he no more kepe.

Goþe swyþe, one or two to-gedyr, And, what he be, bryngeþ hym hedyr.” Þe deuylys come un-to hys bedde, And styrte a?en, þey were so dredde; Þe bedde, ne hym, ne durst þey touche, So had he marked hym with þe crouche. Þey turned a?en to syre Satan, And seyd, þey durst nat brynge þat man. He asked ‘why þat chaunce byfel;’ Þey seyd, hyt was “a lore vessel, An empty vessel þat marked was From þe and þyne, syre Satanas; Þe vessel, whan hyt þere was leyde, Vn-to vs hyt longed nede. Alas þe whyle þey gunne to reme! He haþ hys mark þat wyl hym ?eme.” Þe Iew þey called ‘a voyde vessel,’ And forsoþë, so hyt fel; Voydë he was of hys lawe, For he forsoke hyt for fyne awe; ‘Lore,’ for he hadde nat oure lawe take Seþþe he hadde hys owne forsake. For þys þyng, y hope þey seyd, And called þe Iew a vessel voyd. But þey my?t nat do hym no dere, Noþer to Satanas lede ne bere; So hadde he hym with þe croyce blessed, Þat of hym algate þey myssed.

Seynt Ierom wente yn-to deserte, For drede of synne and foly grete. Men asked hym why he þedyr ?ede, Syn he was an holy man yn dede; “y wentë þedyr, synne to fle, Y dredde hyt wlde ha maystred me; Synne of womman wyl with me fy?t, And y fele me yn moche vnmy?t.

Iustyne þerwyþ defendeþ here so Þat we ne may haue with here to do; And, for here lyfe ys gode and clene, Oure maystry may ry?t no?t be sene; For ?yf she lyued yn wykkednes, Þan my?te we do to here sum stres.” Cypryen seyd vnto þat fende, “Ihesus ys nat þan ?oure frende, Hyt may weyl be hym-self haþ my?t Syn ?e drede hys croys be syght; And ys nat ?yt þe samë tre, Haþ þat tokene more my?t þan ?e?” “?ee,” seyde the fendë, “certaynly, Ouer vs alle he haþ maystry; And euermore so shal be doun For hyt was hys owne passyoun; No þyng þat man may of hym sey, Doþe oure powere so moche a-weye As nemne þat passyun and þat rode Þat he shedde on, hys swetë blode; Heuene and helle þat passyun douten, And creatures allë þarto louten, And specyaly ‘Ihesus,’ þat name Ys our shenshyp and oure shame.” when Cypryen þys vndyrstode, He forsoke hem, and bycom gode, And alle þe crafte þat he hadde haunted, And Crystendome to take he graunted; He dyd breke his maumetrye, And dyd hyt brenne byfore hys ye; Seþþen at þe bysshope of þe cyte He dyd hym crysten man to be, Seþþen he was so stedfast Yn þe beleue, þurgh þe holy gast, Þat he was ordeyned dekene hye, And seþþen bysshope he was wurþy; Seþen made he Iustyne, abbas Of alle þe ladyes, as wurþy was. Swyche grace fel seþþen on hom, Þat boþe þey suffred martyrdom; And now ys Cypryen with God so herd Þat he ys wurschypde yn alle þe werlde; And she ys callede Seynt Iustyne, A martyr and an holy vyrgyne. Þys tale y tolde to ?ow aboute, Þat ?e ne dur no wycchecrafte doute, ?yf þou be—þat ys to mene— Yn beleuë gode, and lyfë clene. who-so þurgh wycchëcrafte haþ tene, Prey to God and seynt Cypryene And to þe mayden Seynt Iustyne, Þat þey delyuer hem fro þat pyne.

Þe foulë wurde, þe speker dereþ, And þat hyt hereþ and furþ bereþ; Y hauë toldë of þys lak Yn þe fyfþe comaundement, þer y spak, whan y of a nunnë tolde, Þat coudë nat here tungë holde. ?yt ys þyr a spyce of leccherye, Auauntëment of olde folye: A kaynard and an oldë folte, Þat þryfte haþ loste, and boghte a bolte, he shal become[n] a dyssour, And telleþ how he was a lecchour; Ioye he haþ, hym-self to dyffame Of alle hys synnes þat he kan name, And auante hym alle an hye, And make men lagh at hys foly; And þat ys nat þe synnë leste, Auaunte þy synne to hym þat þou sest. Sodom sank, and Gomore, For þey kryed here synne aywhore; Þese twey cytees, boþe þey sank, For þey hadde ioye at synne þat stank. Feyrer hyt were, oure synne forhele, Þan make auauntement þer-of to fele; Þe apostle seyþ þys autoryte, “?yf þou be nat chaste, be þou pryue;” Telle hyt þy prest, and to no mo; For oþer tellyng, ys boþe synne and wo. ?yt ys þyr a specyal spece Þat doþ leccherye klymbe by a grece: who so wyllë ?yftës ?yue, On lecheryë he may cleue; For synne, no ?yftys þou receyue; For doute of gyle þou shalt hem weyue;forsake For whan a lechour haþ ?yue hys mede, Þan hopeþ he weyl þat he shal spede. Y rede, ?e wommen, ?yueþ gode entent, For medë ?e wyl sone consent; Many one for mede doþ ful euyl, Men sey ofte ‘mede ys þe deuyl.’ ?yt spekeþ he of a more tresun Þat for lechery ys doun; ?yf men or womman be so wylde To fordo a getyng of a chylde wyþ wurde or dede, syn hyt ys gete, with mete or drynk þat þey do ?ete, Or oþer strenkþë, þat hyt dye, Þan þey doun ful grete folye; with slaghter hast þou þere hyd, Þat þy lecherye ys nat kyd; Gretly yn euyl þou art coupáble Yn twey synnës, and dampnáble. A-noþer vyleynye þyr ys, To do a womman synne þurgh stres: ?yf a womman mete paráuenture Yn pryuë stedë, a lechour, ?yf he wyl do with here synne, And she ne may a-weyë wynne But she swerë oþys grym A-noþer tyme to come to hym, Or he makeþ here trouth-plyght Anoþer tymë when she my?t, For þat trouþë, y answere Þat no perel shal she bere; She nat synneþ nat dedly, Hyt ys nó wyl, but maystry; Better ys to skape with an oþe, Þan synne dedly, and God be wrothe. Here-of my?t men mochë speke, Of trouþë þat men alle day breke, For, fals trouþës, and fykyl, For lechery, are ?yue mechyl. ?yf þou a womman trouþë plyght Out of holy cherchës sy?t; Men oght nat so for to do Þogh þat frendes consente þarto; For holy cherche oght fyrst for to wyte Of here gederyng, ?yf hyt may sytte Of allë folës are þey fyles, Þat gentyl wymmen begylys with a trouþë of tresun To reuë here, here warysun, But she do by here ordynaunce Of hem þat shuldë here auaunce.

And y shal telle here, ?yf ?e wyl, A talë for þe samë skylle, Þat a man myshopë noght Þogh he haue grete temptyng of þoght. [The Tale of the tempted Hermit, or How we should never Despair.] Seynt Gregory telleþ, for oure profyte, How þyr was onys an ermyte: Þys ermyte had grete temptyng yn hys þoght, ouer alle þyng; And as þys temptyng on hym ran, He ?ede vnto an oldë man And tolde hym allë, vp an downe, Of hys grete temptacyun. Þat olde man seyd to hym astyte ‘He was nat wurþy to be an Ermyte, Þat swychë þoghtës shuldë þynke, And þoght of womman wulde hym synke.’ Þys oldë man gan hym so stoute, Þat hys gode hope was alle yn doute; For þe wurdes þat þe olde man gan seye, Yn-to þe wurlde he toke þe weye. As he cam goyng yn þe strete, An holy abbot gan he mete; Þe abbotys name was Apollo, And sone he spake þe ermyte to; Þe ermyte hadde so sory þoght, A?en to þe abbote spake he noght. Þys abbot was a ful wys man, And yn hys þo?t ful sone hyt ran, And be þe semlant of þe ermyte, Þat he was yn grete sorowe and syte; Þe abbot asked hym ones or twyys; At þe laste þe ermyte seyd hys auys. “Y am,” he seyd, “bro?t allë down with flesshly temptacyun; And at an oldë man y was, And tolde hym alle my hardë kas; And he seyd, y was nat wurþy, Þe ermytagë to com ny, Ne was yn wey me to saue, whyl y shulde swych þo?tës haue; And, for he comforted me so yl, Yn-to þe worlde now ys my wyl, And lyue þere best wyse þat y may, Syn y serue nat God to pay.” Þan seyde þe abbot syre Apollo, “Þe olde man wyst nat what was to do; Þou mayst se now, by my vysage, Þat y am olde, and weyl yn age, And y fele a ful hard prykyl Þat my flesshe tempteþ me mykyl, Vnneþë ys hyt day ne oure Þat y ne am þar-with tempted soure; But þogh my þoght be oute of skyl, To do ?yt wers[ë], y ne wyl; Ne more shalt þou þy self mysdo, Þogh þou be tempted neuer so. Y rede, þat yn godenes þat þou dwelle, And turne a?en vnto þy celle, And fonde a?ens þy flesshe to fy?t, And late hyt nat haue alle þe my?t.” He bro?te þys ermyte to swyche certeyne, Þat to hys celle he turned a?eyne. Þe abbot knew [wel] alle þe pas where þe olde man wonyng was; Þedyrwarde þe wey he nam. And when he a lytyl besydë cam, He sette hym dowun, and preyd Ihesu Ful of my?t and [of] vertu, Þat þe olde man my?t fele sum þyng Of þe ermytes flesshely temptyng, To chastyse hym for hys broþer, Þat he myscumfort eft noun oþer. when he hadde leye yn orysun long with grete deuocyun, He ros vp, and byhelde, And sagh a blak man stonde yn þe felde, And to þe olde man arwes ded shete Ry?t many, and sum wel grete. So many arwes to hym he drogh, Þat þe olde man felt temptyng ynogh; Þe arwes were temptacyons, And sharpë sterynges, and felons; So many and smart, he hem hadde, Þat he sate as he hadde be madde, Þat wytte hadde lorë, as he sat, Or was yn a were to do sum-what. Ar he aght seyd, ar dyd any dede, Þe same weye þat þe ermyte ?ede, Þat yche wey þe ermyte ?ede ynne To þe worlde, to do hys synne. Þe abbot Appollo say euerydeyl; And how he was temptede, he wyst hyt weyl, And fonded for to take þe strete, with þat olde man for to mete: he seyd, “olde man! what dost þou here, And why hast þou so mornyng chere? whydyr hast þou þoght to go? Be sy?t hyt semeþ þat þe were wo.” Þe oldë man seyd ry?t no?t, But hyt ran hym weyl yn þo?t Þat þe abbot had inspyracyun, And wyst hys grete temptacyun; For shame he my?t nat telle how smart Þe temptyng þat come to hys hert; But þe abbot wyst for certeyn, And bad hym to turne a?eyn; And shewed hym weyl for two þynges, why þat he hadde no temptynges; He seyd, ‘þe fende of hym ne ro?te, Ne hym to tempte aboutë so?te, Ne þoght hys lyfe so moche wurþy, For he helde hym self so holy, And blamed oþer for here fallyng,’ “Þy lyfe hym þynkeþ ys wurþ no þyng; To gode men ys hyt grete passyun To fele þe fendes temptacyun; And for he tempted þe no?t here, Yn ouþer stede þou shalt by hyt dere; Ne late þou nat ly?tly by þo Þat are tempted of flesshly wo, But, þenk weyl þat þey are gode, ?yf þey þat temptyng with-stode, And are sykerer aftyr temptynges, And kepe hem better with many þynges; And ?yt men sey God loueþ hem no?t, Þat haue no temptyng yn dede ne þoght. Þys temptyng was for þy despyte Þat þou haddest of þe gode ermyte whan he hys temptyng to þe shrofe, And þy cumforte awey hym drofe.” At þys pas þys tale tolde ys For temptacyons of mannys flesshe, Þat none ne myscumforte hym Þogh þat hys flesshe be bryst and brym. So holy man was neuer none Þat temptacyun ne hat hym ouergone, were hyt lytyl, or were hyt mykyl, Þat of hys flesshe ne haþ hadde sum prykyl; And þo þat wyl be ry?t certeyne, Cumforte hem weyl to fy?t a?eyn, For no man may yn certeyn be, But he fy?t flesshly lustys to fle. God graunte vs allë now fro heþen Oure flesshë so to holde be-neþen, And oure soules so to save aboue, Þat God of heuene vs allë loue. Here bygynneþ Sacrylage. Of þese dedly synnës seuene, Þat we wraþþe with, God of heuene, Of hem haue we touched neyde As holy men haue wryten and seyd; ?yt mow[ë] we nát weyl werche ?yf we forgetë holy cherche, holy cherche, our modyr dere, Of here shul we telle ?ow here, How men synne, and on what wyse, A?ens þat falleþ to here fraunchyse. Þat a?ens here fraunchyse falles, ‘Sacrylegë’ men hyt calles; ‘Sacrylegë,’ frenche hyt ys, Menyng of ‘mysdede’ or ‘mys.’ ‘Mysdedë to holynes,’ ‘Sacrylege’ on Englysshe ys; Allë þyng þat men with-holde, Stole or reftë, ?yue or solde, with-outë leue of here wytyng, Þat kepë holy cherches þyng, Alle swych þyng ys sacrylege, with-outë leue ys alle outrage. Now of þe fyrst þat we haue spoke, Þey þat hauë cherches broke, And stole þo þynges þat were þer-ynne, ‘Sacrylage’ men calle þat synne. ?yf þyng vnhalewed were forgete, Þat yn holy cherche were lete, Or halewed þyng yn ouþer stede lay, And oght þerof were bore away, where hyt werë ?yue or solde, For sacrylege, alle ys hyt tolde. Many vyces þerto longe; Alle are þey synne, but sum are stronge; y shal ?ow telle of sum maners As ‘manuel pecchés’ me lers. But, vnkynde and enuyous, Ouerdo, proud, and daungerous, Euermorë fynde þey teyl, Þogh a man sey neuer so weyl; Noþeles, so weyl y nat seyd, But þat to my sawe, blame may be leyd For foule englyssh, and feble ryme Seyde oute of resun many tyme; But God ?elde hem at here endyng, Þat wyl amende myn vnkunnyng; But who so blameþ and wyl nat amende, He doþe nat as þe curteys kende. Go we furþe now on oure werk:— ?yf a man yn euyl smyte a clerk, Yn sacrylage he falleþ ylle ?yf he dyde hyt by hys wylle. ?yf he be man of relygyoun, Þou art to blame with more resun; Twey skyles are ful perylous, Boþe ordred and relygyous. Also relygyous are to wyte, Þat for maystry wyl gladly smyte; Þey ogh to be suffráble and meke, And no foly on ouþer men seke; Hys tung shuld be hys fauchoun; Hys strokes shulde be hys orysun; ?yf any be yn foly stoute, Holde yn cloystre, and com nat out. Also may he be sore a-ferde Þat doþ vyleynye yn chyrche ?erde, Namly, syn hyt halewed was, Þe more he doþë of trespas. Vnkynde man ys he hardly Þat yn cherche ?erde doþ vyleyny; Oure long hous hyt ys to come, To reste yn, tyl þe day of dome. Þerfore we shuld, ?yf we were kynde, kepe hyt clene with godë mynde. And þese prestes me þynkeþ do synne Þat late here bestys fyle þer-ynne. Þe gres ys hys þat þerë grenes, Þe placë ys þe parysshenes. But lordës þat haue seynorye, Þey do þeryn most vyleynye; For þer hope ys, whan þey shul deye, Þat yn þe cherche men shul hem leye; And y shal telle a lytyl wy?t, how a bonde man bourded with a kny?t; And þe borde ys gode to here, who-so loueþ wurdes to lere. [The Tale of the Reproof that a Norfolk Bondman gave a Knight for not respecting the Sanctity of a Churchyard.] Yn Northfolk, yn a tounne, wonede a kny?t besyde a persone; Fyl hyt so, þe kny?tes manere was nat fro þe cherche ful fere; And was hyt þan, as oftyn falles, Brokë were þe cherche-?erde walles. Þe lordës hyrdës often lete Hys bestys yn-to þe cherche ?erde &amp; ete; Þe bestys dyd as þey mote nede, Fyled oueral þere þey ?ede. A bond man say þat, and was wo Þat þe bestys shuld þere go; He com to þe lorde, and seyd hym þys:— “Lorde,” he seyde, “?oure bestys go mys; ?oure hyrde doþ wrong, and ?ourë knauys, Þat late ?oure bestys fyle þus þese grauys; Þere mennys bonys shuldë lye, Bestës shuld do no vyleynye.” Þe lordes answere was sumwhat vyle, And þat falleþ euyl to a man gentyle; “weyl were hyt do ry?t for þe nones To wurschyþ swych[ë] cherlës bones; what wurschyp shuld men make Aboute swych cherlës bodyes blake?” Þe bonde man answerëd and seyd wurdys to-gedyr ful weyl leyd: “Þe lorde þat made of erþë, erles, Of þe same erþe made he cherles; Erlës my?t, and lordës stut, As cherlës shal yn erþe be put; Erlës, cherlës, alle at ones, Shal none knowe ?oure, fro oure, bones.” Þe lorde lestened þe wurdës weyl And recorded hem euery deyl; No morë to hym wulde he seye, But, lete hym go furþe hys weye; He seyd þe bestys shulde no more, By hys wyl, comë þore. Seþen he closed þe cherche?erde so Þat no best my?t come þarto For to ete, ne fyle þer-ynne; So þo?t hym seþen, þat hyt was synne. Þyr are but fewë lordës now Þat turne a wrde so wel to prow; But, who seyþ hem any skylle, Mysseye a?en, fouly þey wylle. Lordynges,—þyr are ynow of þo, Of gentyl men, þyr are but fo.fewe Hyt ys defended yn þe decre, Þat none yn cherche shal beryed be, But bysshope, or abbot of relygyun, Or prest þat ys of gode renoun. A man þat haþ no gode fame ryfe Of dede, of hew, of holy lyfe, Of gode feyþ, ne of charyte Yn almes dede, ne of ouþer bounte, Me þenkeþ hyt were ful perylous To berye swych one yn Goddes house; with swych ys holy cherche but fyled, And hem self are moste bygyled. ?yf þe soulë be nat wurþy Þat þe body lygge so solempny, Þan haþ þe soulë morë peyne; Þat men wurschyp þe body, ys veyne. wykked men and vserers, lechours, and lordys of foule maners, Þat mow ?yue pens ful godë wone, Þey shul be leyde yn toumbe of stone, And hys ymáge ful feyre depeynte, Ry?t as hé were a cors seynt; Þe wrecched soule, þe soþe to seye, Shal a-bye alle þe noblye, And sum for euer be bro?t to bale;sorow And þerby wyl y telle a tale. [The Tale of Valentine, and how Devils puld his Body out of its Grave in the Church.] Þyr was a man þat hyght Valentyne, Playtour he was, and ryche man fyne, For of þe cherche of Myleyne was he playtour, More for mede þan Goddes onour. Besyde Genë, a noble cytë, Deyde Valentyne, and beryed shuld be; Yn seynt Syxtes cherchë shuld he lye; So ordeyned men whan he shuld deye. Þe fyrste ny?t þat he was þere leyde, Þe wardeynes of þe cherche vpbreyde, And herd one cry, rewly and shyl, As he were put oute a?ens hys wyl. Þe wardeynes asked what þat my?t be, “Ryse we vp alle, and go we se.” Þere he was beryed, þydyr þey ran, And sagh many fendes aboute þys man; And of hys graue þey oute hym pulde; Oute of þe cherche, drawe hym þey wulde; Þe deuylys dro? hym by þe fete As hyt were careyne þat dogges ete. Þe wardeynes werë sore affryght For þat noysë and þat syght; A?en to here bedde þey ?ede; Þey durst no lenger dwelle for drede. On þe morne whan þey were ryse, Þey ?ede to þe graue, þere þey were so agryse; Þer-yn alle aboute þey soght, But þe body founde þey no?t. Þey opende þe dores, and loked aboute, And fonde þe body lygge þere with-oute; Þe fete ybounde to-gedyr ful faste, And as a foulë careyne caste. Seynt Gregory seyþ hardly, Þere he lay fyrst, he was nat wurþy; But hys soule hadde pyne þe more For þe pompe and pryde þat he was leyd þore. lordes are besy aboute to haue Proude stones lyggyng an hye on here graue; Þurgh þat pryde þey mowe be lore, Þogh þey hadde do no synne byfore; Hyt helpyþ ry?t noght, þe toumbe of pryde, whan þe soule fro pyne may hyt nat hyde. ?yf þou euer vsedest halewed þyng, And wystyst hyt fyl to cherches offryng, Hyt ys grete synne, y do þe to knowne, ?yf þou helde hyt as for þyn owne. ?yf þou wyþhelde any þyng seþyn Þat hyt was to holy cherche ?euyn, Þyn or ouþres, with-outë leue Of parsone, or prest, or cherchë reue; Hyt ys sacrylage, y þe ply?t, To wyþholde þat falleþ to cherchë ry?t. ?yf þou dedyst euer þat vnlawe, A man oute of holy cherche to drawe Seþen þat he toke hym þar-tyl, Þou hast synned yn moche vnskyl. But ?yf he hadde do a?ens þe assyse Þat fyl to holy cherches fraunchyse, Slayn one þar-ynne, or robbed hyt, Hyt shulde nat þan saue hym, by my wyt. Þe lewed man, holy cherche wyl forbede To stounde yn þe chaunsel whyl men rede: who-so-euer þarto ys custummer, Þogh he be of grete powere, Boþe he synneþ and doþe greuaunce A?ens þe clergy ordynaunce. But ?yt do wymmen gretter folye Þat vse to stonde among þe clergye, Oþer at matyns, or at messe, But ?yf hyt were yn cas of stresse; For þerof may come temptacyun, And dysturblyng of deuocyun; For foule þoght cumþ of feble ye-sy?t, And fordoþë grace with ry?t; And with a tale hyt may be shewed, Þat ys gode boþe for lered and lewed. [The Tale of the Temptation of St. John Chrysostom's Deacon.] An holy man telleþ vs þus, Men calle hym Ion Crysostomus; He was a bysshope, and ful gode clerk, Þat shewe hys bokës of hys werk; Swych grace of God, grauntede hym was, At euery tyme þat he song hys masse Þe holy goste to hym was sent whan he shulde receyue þe sacrament; Certeynly, aftyr þe sacrë, Yn a dowue lyknes he my?t se, So whyte and so blesful, and so clere, whan he vsed vpp-on þe autere. Of þat cumfort, and þat sy?t, He þanked oftë God almy?t. Þe fendë hadde þarwith enuye, And wulde shewe hys wykked maystry. A day seynt Ion shulde synge hys messe, Þe fende made hym yn womman lyknesse, weyl atyrede, with mochë pryde, And stodë ouþer men besyde. Þe dekene þat serued seynt Ion, At here turnyng tymes echon He behelde þys womman weyl, And hys herte chaunged euery deyl; Temptacyun of þys womman, Ouer al yn hys þo?t hyt ran. Þe bysshope, aftyr þe sacrë, Shulde receyue God, as byfyl to be; As he stode and heylde þe oste, He loked vp aftyr þe holy goste; But þat tyme ne come hyt no?t. Seynt Ion hadde þarfor grete þo?t, He soght yn hys herte aboute, But þeryn foundë he no doute Þat fyl to synne, ne dedly þyng To lette þe holy gostes comyng. He called hys dekene to hym bylyue, And cunseyled hym ‘he shuld hym shryue Þyf he felt oght hym wyþ-ynne,’ “Any maner of dedly synne Yn þoght or dede þat þou mayst mene; Of alle, y pray þe, shryue þe clene.” Þe dekene þan opunly with mouþe Shroue hym of allë þat he couþe. He seyde, “of o þyng y haue gret doute: Yn þoghtës, whan we turnede aboute, On a womman myn y?e ys y-caste; Þe sy?te of here myn herte to-blaste And, swal yn my herte so grete, Þe þo?t of here ne coude y lete; But God and ?ow, mercy y crye Of þat þo?t and þat folye.” Þe bysshope seyd hyt was tresun Of þe fendes temptacyun.

Þe preste, and oþer þat þere stode, helde hym a fole, þat coude no gode. Seþþë, whan þe messe was done, Þe preste asked þe dekene sone, ‘why þat he so ferde, and how þat he, yn hys gospel, logh?’ Moche þarfore he gan hym blame, For þe lewed folk þoght hyt shame. Þe dekene told hym why hyt fel þere to laghe yn hys gospel: “As y redde þat ychë tyde, Twey wymmen Iangled þere besyde; Betwyx hem to, y say a fende with penne and parchëmen yn honde, And, wrote alle þat euer þey spake, Pryuyly be-hynde here bake. whan hys rolle was wryte alle ful, To drawe hyt oute he gan to pul; with hys teþe he gan to drawe, And hardë for to tugge and gnawe, Þat hys rolle to-braste and rofe; And hys hede a?ens þe walle drofe Só hard, and so ferly sore, Whan hys parchemen was no more. whan y say þat, y lete so gode, Y brast on laghter þere y stode, Þat he so mochë sorow hadde, As hys wrytyng was alle to-fade; And when he parceyued þat y wyste, He al to-drofe hyt with hys fyste, And went a-wey, alle for shame; þarfore y logh and hadde gode game.” Þe prest hym asked ‘whedyr he say mo.’ “Many,” he seyd, “y sagh þere go, And wrote oueral þere men tolde, But none so moche þat y dyde beholde; Hym behelde y weyl ynogh, For þat he dyd, þere-at y logh.” Þan wyst þe prest, þurgh þat sy?t Þat he was weyl with God almy?t.

Þarto shal y preue my sawe By a tale of þe oldë lawe; And þys tale yn þat tyme fyl, Þat was of þe prophete Danyël. [The Tale of Belshazzar's Feast, and the Prophet Daniel.] Þyr was a kyng of grete powere; yn hys tyme was none hys pere; ynogh he hadde of worldës my?t, And Baltazar hys namë hy?t. Þys kyng was a paynym, and with oste he come to Ierusalem, And robbed þe temple, þys Balta?are, And þe tresour awey bare; Þe vessel þat was of ryche metalle, Þat Goddes temple was seruede with-alle, þat, and more, he dyd aloyne, And ledde hem yn-to Babyloyne. Sone aftyrward, þys ychë kyng Deyd, and madë hys endyng. hys sone reyned yn þat same, And Balta?arë was hys name; Alle þe vessel with hym lefte, Þat hys fadyr hadd stole and refte. A day he made a noble feste with barons and with rychë geste; Þys vessel þat hys fadyr stale, Rychely he dyd hym serue with-alle; Of þe vessel þey ete and dranke, But to God made þey no þanke; But yn alle here moste gladyng, To fals goddys þey made wurschypyng. A kandelstyke stode þe kyng before, Þat oute of Ierusalem was bore; Þe kyng lokede to þat candelstyke, And sagh besyde a grete ferlyke: Vndyr þe kandelstyke, a lytel logh, He sagh an hande wryte on þe wogh; No morë he sagh þan þe hande, But þe lettres were weyl farande; he redde hyt as he sate on þe des, “Mane techel fares.” No more þyr was þere wryte; On englys þus ys hyt to wyte, ‘To mornë shal departyng be, Of þy ryche kyngdom fro þe.’ Þe kyng vndyrstode no þyng of þys, Ne none of hysë coude hym wys. As he þys hand began to holde, hys herte bygan to tremle and colde; he shewed hyt to alle hys ássemble, And crydë hyt þurgh þe cyte, ‘Þat ?yf any coude do hym to wyte, what hyt mente, þat þere was wryte, He shulde haue of hym grete mede, Þat coudë vndo þat yn dede.’ But none of alle, forsoþe to wene, Coude telle þe kyng what hyt wlde mene. But þe quene seyd sone anone: “Syre kyng, y wotë where ys one, Þat kan do ?ow alle to knowe what ys wrytë on þe wowe. yn þys cyte, yn a strete, woneþ a ful wys prophete, hys name men callë Danyël, he shal vndo þe wrytyng wel.” Þe kyng aftyr Danyël sente, And þe prophete to hym wente; Þe kyng hym preyd, byfore hem alle, To tellë hem what shulde befalle. Þe prophete wuldë no þyng hyde: “Þe hand þat þou sawe yn þe euyntyde, hyt was sent fro God almy?t, Þat hys wraþþe ys to þe dy?t, For þou were serued of þe vesseles Þat of hys temple were Ieuwels; Þys day before, of hem þou ete, And no wurschyp of hym þou lete, Þat ys God, alle þyng weldande, And þe and þyne haþ yn hys hande; But to fals goddes þou madest onour with vessel of hys owne tresour; And for þou dedyst boþe euyl, and seyd, Þy kyngdom ys yn balaunce leyd, Tyl ry?t be-demeþ, with euyn hand, To wham hyt shal be ?yue, þy land. Þurgh dome of God, hyt ys so dryue, To twey maner of folke þy land ys ?yue; Medys, and Persys, þy land shul haue; Þe, ne þyne, mayst þou nat saue. Here ys wryte þe samë wyse, Y sey to þe, ry?t as hyt seyse.” Þe samë ny?t þe lande was lore, Þe kyng was slayn, and awey bore. Here mayst þou se, euyl-wunne þyng, with eyre shal neuer make gode endyng, Namly, with þyng of holy cherche Shalt þou neuer spede wel to werche. Þat mayst þou se by parsones eyres, hyt fareþ with hem as doþe with þese feyres; Now ys þe feyrë bygged weyl, And on þe morne ys þer neuer a deyl: Ryche tresoure, now furþe men leye, And on þe touþer day hyt ys alle aweye; O day, to-gedyr men mowe hyt se, A-nouther, sprede þurgh all þe cuntre. Þus fareþ hyt by þese parsones cosynes; Þát þe parsone wynnyþ, þe cosyne tynes; yn þe parsones tyme, rychely he lyueþ, Aftyr hym, no man of hym ?yueþ; yn hys tyme, ofte pens he telleþ, Aftyr hym, for pouert, penys he selleþ. Also with purchasours ry?t so hyt fareþ, Alle þat þey bygge, here eyrës bareþ; A purchasoure may beye þyng, &amp; with lawe, with-oute any dede of wrong or sawe; But lokeþ, ?yue he wynne þat katel weyl, wharewith he byeþ hyt euerydeyl. ?yf he haue wunne þe penys ry?t, Þan haþ he þe lande with-outë ply?t; ?yue he haue wunne þe penys falsle, with ry?t to þe lande com neuer he. with fals[ë] weyght, of fals[ë] peys, And many falshede ouþer weys; And ?yt moste, with fals sweryng, wynneþ manyone moche þyng; with swyche þyng, wene þou hyt no?t Þat þe hous ne lande was ry?tly bo?t.

Gode ?yue vs grace so to serue here Holy cherche, oure modyr dere, Here so to serue, and wurschyp make, Þat we be hyre, and she vs take. Here bygynne the Seuenþe Sacramentys of holy cherche. [Of Holy Bapteme.] The fyrst sacrament ys holy bapteme, Houe of watyr, and noyted with creme; ‘Crystendom,’ or ‘crystynyng,’ Þat ys on englys, oure spekyng. Crystendom, to cryst hyt longeþ, And to alle þat crystendom vndyrfongeþ; Þys ys þe fyrst and pryncypalle, Þurgh þe whych we are saued alle; Saued we are, þurgh crystendam, Of þe heued synne of Adam, yn whych synne alle mankynde ys bore, ?yt, and shal be, and was byfore. Adams synnë was so grefe, Þat þyr was to God, none so lefe, Þyt he ne shulde to hellë gone But he were wasshe yn þe fonte stone, yn fonte stone and watyr baptysed, As Ihesu cryst haþ dyuysed. ?yf þou beleue þat any wham ys saued with-oute crystyndam, y seye, forsoþe þou hast mys went A?ens þys holy sacrament. Ofte we here þe lewed men seye, Þat erre ful moche oute of þe weye, Þat of þe Iewës seye sum oun, ‘Þey ne wote wheþer þey be saued or noun;’ But of sum prestes ys gretter tene, Þat so of þe Iewës also wene; Certes, þey are alle yn were, And yn þe feyþ þey are nat clere, For, shal neuer Iewe þat deyeþ Iewe, Of heuene blys haue part ne prewe, But he be crystened yn þe holy gaste, And yn þe sacrament be ful stedfast. Lo, here a wurde to leue ?oure drede! yn þe gospel þat we rede, Þat god Ihesu vs allë techeþ Þurgh seynt Mark, þat hyt precheþ, “He þat beleueþ and ys baptysed, He shal be saued, so ys dyuysed; And he þat beleueþ nat, forsoþe &amp; ywys, Boþe body and soulë, lore he ys.” loke how ?e mow be a-bawed, þat seye þat þe Iewe ys saued! Þe Iewe, þe oldë lawë kan, But þat alone may saue no man; And þarfore was hyt fyled and left, For heuenë blys, vs hyt refte Þurgh Adams synne fro vs echone, Tyl hyt was clensed yn flume Iordone, whan Ihesu was baptysed þer-ynne For to wasshe awey þat synne; And al þat euer to Cryst wyl teme, Behoueþ be baptysed yn watyr and creme: Þan art þou clene, þou shalt beleue, Of Adams synnë, and of Eue. Þarfore hyt ys þe fyrst sacrament Þat þou art to, fyrst made present; Lokë þat þou kunne hyt knowe; hyt makeþ þe hygh, þere þou were lowe, hyt makeþ þe fre, þat er were þralle, Fro þe fendës seruage alle, Þat þe þar neuer þe fendë drede But hyt be þurgh þyn owne mysdede. ?yf a chylde be dedë bore— Þogh hyt were quyk yn wombe byfore— And, receyue nat þe bapteme, Of heuene may hyt neuer cleme; with-outë doute, beleue ?e þys, Þat hyt shal neuer come to blys; Ne peyne of hetë, ne of colde, Hyt shal non fele, no ry?t hyt wolde; Hyt noght mysdyd, ne serued wo, Ne to nonë shal hyt go; Þys ys peyne with-outen ende, hyt shal neuer to Ioyë wende. Gretë grace ys to hem lent, Þat here receyue þys sacrament. Also, ?e þat heue chyldryn al day, loke ?e be stedfast yn oure lay, Þat nonë haue yn hertë doute, Ne to wycchecrafte leste no loute. Þou settest þy self yn borghgage To teche þe chylde whan hyt haþ age; ?yf þou se hyt mysdo or seye, Þou shalt teche hyt better wey, ?yf hyt be so þat þou maght, Þou art holde þat hyt be taght; Quyte þe weyl oute of borghgang, Þat þou ne haue for hyt no wrang. loke also, ?yf þou euer ware Yn place þere wymmen chyldryn bare; ?yf þou sawe hyt yn perel of dede, And þou ne coudest do bote ne rede, Ne seyë wurde, ne helpe at nede, So þat hyt to þe deþë ?ede; Þou shalt þerforë perel haue; Vnkunnyng shal þe nat saue; For euery man, boþe hygh and logh, Þe poyntes of bapteme oweþ to knowe, To helpe chyldryn yn many kas; Men wete neuer what nede one has. who so ne kan, y rede hym lere Yn sy?te, yn dede, and he may here. Y shal ?ow teche, as y herde telle Onës a frerë menor spelle: “?yf þou se a chylde yn swyche perel Þat none may saue hyt with no wylle, Sey þan þus, ?yf þou haue haste, “y crysten þe yn þe name of þe fadyr &amp; sone &amp; holy gast,” And ?yue, what þou wylt, hyt a name, And kast on water; þan ys hyt frame; And ?yf þou ?yue hyt namë none, Noþer Robert, Wyllyam, no Ione, Loke þat þese wurdës be weyl seyd, And water þer-on algate leyde; And þat þyr be none ouþer waste, But yn þe fadyr and sone, and holy gaste; Þese wurdes for?ete þou naght, Ne watyr, what as euer elles be wro?t.” Mydwyuës þat wyþ wymmen wone, Alle þe poyntes, behoueþ hem kone; Prestes shuld teche hem þe ordynaunce, what þey shuld sey and do yn chaunce, And examyne her what she couthe, what she shuld do, and seye with mouþe. [The Tale of the Midwife who christend a Child wrongly.] Y shal ?ow telle of a mydwyfe, Þat loste a chylde, boþe soule &amp; lyfe. he tolde hyt yn hys sermoun, And ?aue here ofte hys malysoun. Þys mydwyfe, whan þe chylde was bore, She helde hyt on here lappe before; And whan she sawe þat hyt shulde deye, She bygan, loudë for to crye, And seyd, “God and seynt Ione Crysten þe chylde, boþe flesshe and bone.” Þys mydwyffe noghte ellës seyde, And yn þe cherche-?erde þey wulde hyt haue leyde, As a-nouþer chyld shuld ha be Þat hade receyuede þe solempte. Þe prest askede þe mydwyffe, ‘?yfe hyt were cristenede whan hyt hade lyffe, And who hyt cristened, and on what manere, And what was seyde, þat any myghte here.’ Þe mydwyffe seyde unto þe prest, “Þys herde þey þat stode me nest, ‘Þat God almyghty and Seynt Ioun ?yue þe chylde cristendom yn flesshe and boun.’” Þan seyd þe preste, “God and seynt Iame ?yue þe boþe sorow and shame, And Crystys malysun haue þou for-þy, And alle þe ouþer þat were þe by! Yn euyl tymë were þou bore, For yn þy defaute, a soule ys lore.” She was commaunded she shuld no more Come eftesones þere chyldryn were bore. Mydwyues, y tolde thys tale for ?ow, Þat ?yf ?e kunnat, lerneþ how To sauë þat, God bo?t ful dere, Þe poyntes of bapteme y rede ?ow lere; Mydwyfe ys a perylus þyng But she kunne þe poyntes of crystenyng; Ne beleueþ nat on þese shappers, ?oure mysdede ful mykyl deres; y wolde þo shappers were on lowe, And al þo þat on hem trowe. Þe beleue ys, ‘þe fadyr and sone &amp; holy gaste;’ Alle ouþer beleue ys wykked and waste; Þurgh hem ys alle þyng shape &amp; wro?t, And ouþer shappers ne are no?t; God ys shapper of alle þyng, he wote þe mydward, and þe endyng; Þe oþer shappers, þat men of seye, Hyt ys a beleue of deuyl weye. Þe mete þat ?e leye at þe chyldës hede For swyche shappers, were bettyr leued; ?yf hyt for hem þerë lye, Þan ys hyt a wykked erysye; ley hyt for þe loue of þe holy gaste, Fadyr, and sone, oo God stedfaste, As wysly as he become a chylde, Bore of Marye, mayden mylde, Þat he ?yue hyt to lyue yn gode grace, And gode endyng, and se hys face. ?yf þou were euer so vnwys For to crystene a chyldë twys, Or ?yf þou euer consentedest þar-to Þat any ouþer shulde so do,— At home, as yn pryuyte, Anouþer tyme, þat men my?t se,— For ?yf hyt were baptysed at hame wyþ alle þe poyntes of bapteme name, Þan were hyt a?ens þe feyþe to werche, Eftesones to baptyse hyt at cherche; But ?yf þou suppose þyr fayleþ a poynte Þat to þe crystendom shuld a-mounte, Þan were hyt nat for to drede For to fulfyl þat shulde be nede; For alle þe poyntes of watyr &amp; creme, Þurgh alle crystendom ys o bapteme, O baptemë, and nat two, Of alle þe poyntes þat þou sest do. Þarfore he þat ys ones baptysed, Ones for euer ys; þus ys auysed. Also, ?e þat chyldryn heue, ? shul nat for?ete ne leue To teche hyt pater noster &amp; crede; ?yf ?e ne do, hyt ys to drede. To foly þou shalt nat drawe ne wone Þy goddo?tyr ne þy godsone, Namely to þat vylayny Þat falleþ vn-to lechery, Ne to no foly þat may be; Þou shalt teche hem synne to fle. Ne nat be so fole hardy, Þy goddo?tyr to lye þe by, Ne for to dwelle a-lone with þe, For perel þat may falle and be. Many a pryuy peryl þyr ys, And specyaly yn drunkenes; yn drunkenes men wyl rage, And, ragyng wyl reyse korage; And sonë may a man be shent Þat doþe a?ens þe comaundement. Seynt Gregory telleþ yn hys spelle Of swyche a shame þat onës felle. [The Tale of the Bad Bourgeois who lay with his God-daughter and was kild for it.] A man hefe onës at þe fonte A maydë chylde, as men are wonte; Þys mayde wax, and bygan to belde weyl yn-to womans elde; And at Ester tyme gan hyt falle whan men hadde fastë lenten alle, Þys man bysoghte, for specyalte, Þat hys god-do?tyr wyþ hym my?t be, And alle þat ychë Esterday And lenger, ?yf hyt were here pay. Þe fadyr and þe modyr graunted sone; Þey þo?t none euyl my?t be done. Þys man, for drunkenes &amp; vnry?t, lay by hys god-do?tyr þat yche ny?t: Þys man on þe mornë þo?t How synfully þat he hadde wro?t; Ful grete þo?te þan was he ynne, Þat he hadde do so greuus a synne; Twey þoghtes yn hys hertë come, To go to þe cherche, or byde at home: “?yf y vnto þe cherchë ?ede, Of venïaunce y haue grete drede; And, ?yf y nat þedyr go, Men wyl wene y haue do sum wo.” So algate vnto þe cherche he name; he drede nat God, but morë shame. Þe fyrst day, he dred hym sore he shuld be cumbred sumwore, And ?yt a-noþer he lokede ay, whyche tyme þe fende wulde bere hym away; Alle þe woke, for worldës shame, He ?ede to þe cherche, but lytyl to frame; whan he hadde long a-bydë so, And, no skaþe come hym to, Þys þoght he yn hys herte ful raþe, For he hadde þarfore no skaþe, he wendë God had hyt forgete As ouþer men do þat haue forlete; Or þo?t þat he hadde hyt for?yue, And hym neded nat þer-of be shryue, Ne shulde þerof come no myschaunce, For he was of so longe suffraunce. But God, þat fór?eteþ no þyng, he sente þarfore grete heuenyng; Þe seuenþe day þys man deyde, As þe holy man vs seyde; Sone aftyr þat byryed he was, Veniaunce come for þat trespas; Vpp of hys graue a fyre vpp smote— Ful stynkyng and ful hote— And brenned þat cursed body alle, And stone and erþe, boþe grete and smalle; Alle was so brend yn-to þe grounde, Þat of hys body my?t no?t be founde. Here mow ?e here apertly why God toke veniaunce greuusly, Þat God shewed so moche hys Ire, For he synned þat tyme with hyre Þat he lyfte of þe fonte stone: hyt ys a warnyng to vs echone þat we kepe þe sacrament, Oure bapteme þat God haþ sent; And þat we bettyr hyt holde For þys tale þat y ?ow tolde. ?e, Ihesu lordë, þou hyt graunte þat we mow holdë þat cunnaunte þat we at þe fonte stonë make, Ihesu to serue, and Satanas forsake. [Of Confirmation.] The secunde sacrament, y vndyrstonde, Ys graunted of þe bysshop honde; Men kalle hyt ‘confyrmacyon,’ A sykernesse neuer more vndon wyþ no lawe, ne with no skylle, But ?yf ?e self algatë wylle; As ?yf þou boghtest house and land with charter at þy neghburs hande, Þou mayst holde hyt for euer-more, So bapteme þe saueþ ones þore; And ?yf hyt be graunted of þe kyng, Þat þou hast boght, þan ys syker þyng; Syker ys, þat yn rolle ys leyde, For þan may hyt neuer be wyþseyde; þe rollyng fordoþe croppe and rote, And ry?t of þo þat wulde þe mote;plete Rollyng, and þe grete assyse, Aftyr hem may no lawë ryse. Þus fareþ hyt of confyrmacyun Aftyr tyme þat bapteme ys doun; Confyrmacyun ys more ne lesse, But aftyr crystenyng, gode sykernesse; Þys bapteme ys charter of ry?t Þat fordoþë Adams ply?t, And, þat ys of grete pouste, Þat fro þe fende hyt byeþ þe fre, And defendeþ þe þyn erytage, Þat þou mayst holde hyt yn alle þyn age, And saue þy statë euery deyl, ?yf þou kepe þy charter weyl; Ouer þys, ?yf hyt be þy lordes wylle Þat he þy charter wyl fulfyle, Þan art þou stalworth þurgh hys powere, And þy charter made more clere. Þe bysshope ys as lorde or kyng To conferme þy crystenyng; He confermeþ þat we haue take whan we haue Satan forsake, Oure crystendom, þat hyt be sekyr To fende vs a?ens þe fendës bekyr, Þan ys oure charter quyte and clere, Confermyng with þe bysshopes powere. And ?e shul alle weyl vndyrstande, whan chyldryn are blessed of þe bysshopys hande, Þat blessyng ys contermacyoun A?ens þe fendes temptacyun, And makeþ vs stalwurþe yn batayle whan þe fende wyl vs asayle; Þan are we made Goddes champyons, A?ens þe fendës, Goddys felons; þan haue we receyued fully my?t A?ens þe fendë for to fy?t; And ?yf we be yn beleue stedfaste, we haue powere, dowun hym to kaste. Certes, þo men moche mysdo, Þat a-byde long, are þey go þar-to; And wommen, gretly ouer alle þyng, þat wyl nat here chyldryn bryng To receyue þe sacrament At þe bysshopes confyrment; For some wete weyl, þat chyldryn kepe, Þat many are drecched yn here slepe; Þe fende hem sheweþ grete affray, To some on ny?t, and some a day, How þat he, may hem greue, To make ouþer men mysbeleue; Some men hyt here, &amp; some men hyt sees, Yn many stedys, vanytes, More before þe sacrament Þan aftyr, whan he ys shent; Hys powere ys þan moche fordoun Þurgh þys confyrmacyun; For þat oght we, to beleuë ry?t, þat þys sacrament haþ þat my?t. Anoþer poynt, here-to longeþ, Þat lewed men nat vndyrstandyþ: “Þou man or womman, be nat so wylde To holde to þe bysshope þyn owne chylde; For ?yf þou do, art commare To hym þat hyt, gat or bare; ?yf a frende man holde hyt þore, To wedde þat chylde, he may neuer more; þys longeþ to þys sacrament; Þarefor ?yueþ gode entent.” yn þys skyllë, as y kan, hyt ys grete perel to an vncouþe man, A maydë chyldë for to holde Byfore þe bysshope, as y er tolde, But ?yf he askë fyrst byfore, what hyt ys, and where was bore; Elles perauenture yn hys lyue he my?t haue þat chylde to wyue; Or ?yf she ?yue here to folye, he my?t, yn kas, lygge here by; Þys kas ys nat often seen, But hyt may fallë, or haþ ben; Þarfore, noþer mo ne lesse, But ‘wyys ys, þat ware ys.’ Now of þys confyrmacyun wyl we leue oure sermoun; God ?yue vs gracë, for hys my?t, yn þe beleue to ferme vs ry?t, Þat þe holy goste with vs wone, Þat cumþ of þe fadyr and of þe sone. [Of the Sacrament of the Altar.] God almy?ty, þat al þyng weldes, wyndës, watrys, wodes, &amp; feldes, As soþely as þou madest of no?t Alle créatures þat euer were wro?t, For?yue me, to day, Lorde, my synne, Þat y þys wrþys sacrament mowe begynne, And wurschypfully þar-of to speke, Þat we þe beleuë neuer breke; Ne for to tellë, yn þys long, Þyng, þat falle-of, may any wrong, But þat máy be, þe to queme, And vs yn stedfaste beleue to ?eme. Goddës sone, of heuene a-boue, He shewed vs alle, for gretë loue; For whan hys passyun neyghed nye, To hys dyscyplys þat were hym bye, He ?aue hys body hem to fede,— More loue ne my?t he shewe yn dede,— Þat þey shuldë myndë haue On hym, þat he my?t hem saue; ?yt aftyrward he lete hym slo with ful vyle deþ, and pynyng wo; For vs, and hem, ded he þys, To bryngë vs echone to blys, Ne more loue ne my?t he do, Ne neuer man, my?t so do; For vs he ded hyt, þys ys certeyn, Þat we shuld loue hym weyl a?en; Þogh we vs self ?af an hundryd syþe, O poynt of loue ne my?t we kyþe vn-to þe loue þat he haþ vs doun, For hyt ys oure saluacyun; And of vs, askeþ he ry?t no?t But þat may weyl y-nogh be wro?t, No þyng but loue-longyng, To loue hym weyl ouer alle þyng, And for hys loue to leuë synne; hys loue, hys blys, þan mow we wynne; For þou mayst neuer haue hym to þe, But, þou wylt fyrst synnë fle; Alle þyng he loueþ, but synne he hates;steynyst ?yf þou hym louest, with synne þou wlates. ?yf þou loue one, þe behoueþ nedes Forsake þat þyng þat he þe forbedes; Elles, hyt ys tolde no loue, And namëly to God a-boue. And þou mayst nat loue hym with no greyth, But þou haue of hym gode feyþe, Þat ys to seye, to beleue hyt weyl, Alle þat ys wryte of hym euerydeyl. Stedfast beleue, of loue hyt comes; And of beleuë, loue men nomes: So ys þe toon with þe touþer; with stedfast beleue, loue ys þe broþer. To whom ogh þan oure loue be went, But to þe beleue of þys sacrament? Þys, oght to beleue, euery crysten man, And lerne þe beleue of one þat kan, ‘Þat þe bred þat sacred ys At þe auter, ys Goddys flessh:’ Boþe flesshe and blodë þer ys leyd, Þurgh þe wurdes þat þe prest haþ seyd, Þat ly?te with-ynne þe vyrgyne Marye, And on þe rode for vs wulde deye, And fro deþ to lyue he ros, God and man, yn my?t and los. For who so beleueþ nat clere yn þe sacrament of þe autere, He shal neuer þe blys a-byde, For no þyng þat may betyde. Yn þe oldë lawë, þus ys wryte, Boþe Iewes and crysten weyl hyt wete, “God seyd, and hyt was wro?t; he commaunded alle þyng of no?t.” Þese wurdës are verry and clere; Dauyd hem seyth yn þe sautere; Syn he made alle þat no?t er was, lesse maystry were hyt þan yn kas, For to chaunge þe lekënes Yn-to an ouþer þyng þat es; þe lykënes of bred and wyne, Yn flesshe and blode to turne hyt ynne; Yn flessh and blode þe brede be bro?t, Syn he madë alle of no?t. ?yf þou se hyt nat with bodly sy?t, Þy soule with-ynne shal beleue hyt ry?t; And ?yf þou felë no sauour, But ryghtely wyne, and brede of flour, Þat ys þe wysdom of Goddys ordynaunce For to saue vs alle fro þys chaunce; For ?yf hyt fyl, as flesshe to take, wlate we shulde, and hyt forsake; And for he wulde nat men hyt forsoke, But þat alle men hyt vndyrtoke, Þarfore hys wysdom, hys ownë rede, Sauerþ hyt yn wyne and brede; Hyt semeþ bredë, as be sy?t, And as brede, sauer haþ ry?t; Noþyr þe sy?t, noþer þe felyng, Haþ þer-of any certeyn þyng; what shal þan, þe most saue, But stedfast beleue þat þou shalt haue? Stedfast beleue of euery deyl, Þat shal þan, saue þe weyl. And some haue sey hyt bodyly, To whom he shewed hys mercy; Lo here a tale for of ?ow sum, Þat y fonde yn ‘vitas patrum.’ [The Tale of the Priest for whom the Sacramental Bread and Wine were turnd into a Child's Flesh and Blood.] Þyr was a man of relygyoun; Of almës he had grete renoun; But, for þe fende wulde haue hym shent, He beleued nat yn þe sacrament, And seyd ‘hyt was nat Ihesu Þat conceyued was þurgh vertu; Ne Ihesu was nat þe oblé Þat reysed was at þe sacré; And þo þat wurschep ded þarto, To beleue hyt, was nat to do.’ Byfore twey abbotes þus he tolde; Þese abbotes wryte þys tale to holde; hyt oght be tolde to euery wham Þat ys a?ens þe crystendam, Tyl hyt be preued with clergye wheþer hyt be beleue or erysye. Þese abbotes shewed hym þe ry?t weye with alle þe ensamples þat þey coude seye; And he seyd ‘þat hyt was lye, But ?yf he sagh hyt with hys ye.’ “Doþe þan so þat y hyt se, Þan wyl y beleue þat hyt may be.” Þese abbotes preyd a ful seuen ny?t Þat God wulde shewe hym, þurgh hys my?t, Yn flesshe and blode on þe autere, To cónferme hys beleuë clere; And hym-self preyd specyaly Þat God wulde shewe hym also yn body; “Lorde,” he seyde, “for no mysbeleue Þat þou shuldest, with me þe greue, But for to shewe þe ry?t soþenes Þat þou art þe sacrament of þe messe, Þat y may make ouþer certeyn whan y with yën haue þe seyn!” Þe abbotes lay yn orysun Tyl alle þe seuen ny?t were doun; þe seuenþe day, to þe cherche þey cam, And þe touþer man with hem þey nam; A sege was ordeyned for hem þre To beholdë alle þe pryuyte Of þat holy sacrament Þat shewed was yn here present: Betwyxe hem sate þys ychë man Of whom þe myracle fyrst began. whan þe vble was on þe auter leyd, And þe prest þe wurdes had seyd, Alle þre þo?t þan verrylyk, Before þe prest, þat a chyld lay quyk Yn feyrë forme of flesshe and blode; Þys say þey þre, þere þey stode. whan þe preste shulde parte þe sacrament, An aungel dowun from heuene was sent, And sacryfyed þe chylde ry?t þare; As þe prest hyt brak, þe aungel hyt share; þe blode yn-to þe chaleys ran Of þat chylde, boþe God and man. Þys man ?ede to þe hey?est degre, To housel hym, as fyl to be; Hym þoght þe prest bro?te on þe pateyn Morselles of þe chylde alle newe sleyn, And bedde hym a morsel of þe flesshe with alle ?e blode þer-on alle fresshe. Þan gan he cry, with loudë steuene, “Mercy! Goddys sone of heuene! Þe brede þat y sagh on þe auter lye, Hyt ys þy body; y se hyt with ye. Of þe brede, þurgh sacrament, To flesshe and blode hyt ys alle went; Þys y beleue, and euer y shal; For verryly we se hyt alle.” whan he and þey were alle certeyn, yn forme of brede hyt turned a?eyn; He ded hym housel as ouþer wore, And was a gode man for euermore; And alle þe toþer beþ þe better, Þat heren þys tale, or redyn þys lettyr. Þe prest þat sacreþ Goddys body, Hym behoueþ bé clene nedëly: A lewed man þat shal hym receyue, Alle maner of fylþe, behoueþ hym weyue. Be þou neuer so gode a preste, Ne so grete wyttë yn þy breste, Y rede þe here how þe propertes are shewed, Þogh þe langage be but lewed. Þou wost weyl þat þe vblè Ys but a lytyl þyng to se; So shal we be lytyl yn wyl, lytyl and meke, with-outyn yl, No?t yn pryde, ne na?t yn heghþe, For no wysdom ne for no sleghþe, Þat we ne falle with Lucyfere, For proude men wonë with hym þere. Þe vblè ys made of whete, Þe louelyest cornë þat men ete; So shal we be meke and louely To allë þo þat beþ vs by; Þys mekënes ys a?ens Ire, Þat ys with Lucyfere yn fyre. Þe paste of þe vblè, nat ne ogh Be made of any maner of soure dogh; For þe soure dogh makeþ alle soure Þe swetnes þat cumþ of þe floure. By þys soure dogh ys tokenyng Þat enuye ys a wykked þyng, For hyt fordoþe swetnes of dede Þat God shulde ?yue for soulë mede; Þarfore makeþ he none herbergerye Þere he fyndeþ byfore, enuye. A vertu also yn þe whete ys, Þat ys moche a?ens sloghnes; For whetë cornës wyl nat prykke, As otës dowün, or barlykke; Ne we shulde nat haue any prykyl Of ydylnes ouer mykyl. Ydylnes gruccheþ, and ys heuy of þo?t, And also sonë wroþe for no?t; And þat wraþþë cumþ of sorowe, Þat of wanhope wyl mochë borowe. Þys sacrament of þe messe loueþ noun swyche ydulnesse, Ne, with noun, wyl he dwelle, But þere men of Ioyë spelle.

Also þou seest þe vblè ys þynne, And grete dunhede ys noun þer-ynne; And þat wyl weyl sygnyfye A?ens þe synne of glotonye; For þere ne wyl þe sacrament reste, þere glotonye wyl hym oute keste. And þou seest, þe vblè ys whyte; And we shul hauë noun delyte Of no maner of flesshely lak, Of lechery, þat makeþ vs blak. Þese are þe seuene propertes Yn þe vblè, as þou sees; And euery properte þer-ynne Ys a?ens a dedly synne. A?ens þys sacrament, þan do þo Þat are yn synne, and þar-to go, Or are yn wyl a?en to wende To synne, and hemself shende. Also a preste þat goþ, syngeþ hys messe, þat yn dedly synnë ys, An hunder folde he synneþ more Þan ?yf he, a lewed man wore. Alle þey þat receyue þys sacrament yn dedly synne, or wykked entent, yn any óf þese ychë seuene Þat þou hast me herdë neuene, Hyt ys to here dampnacyun, And þarfore veniaunce shal be doun. And, here y shal telle a tale, How hyt ys to þo men bale. [The Tale of the Priest who was enabled to see Folk's sins in their Faces.] A parysshe prest was yn a tounne, A man of ful grete dyscrecyounne;— Dyscrecyun, a ry?t wyt ys, On boþe partys ry?tly to ges;— Of hys parysshenes he vndyrstode, whyche were yl, and whych were gode; Tweyn he haddë for to gete, Þat neuer wuldë synnë lete. And fyl hyt at an esterne, Þat a prest shul none ouþer werne But ?yf hyt be þe gretter synne, As yn cursyng, or yn vnbuxyme. Þys prest was yn gretë þo?t wheþer he shulde housel hem or no?t; he preyd God, of heuene kyng, Þat he wulde sende hym sum tokenyng wheþer hé shulde hem forbede; To housel hem, he þo?t grete drede. Fro God he had þys answere: ‘Þat echone shuld hys owne charge bere, And þat he shulde warne hyt none, But ?yue hyt furþe to euerychone;’ “Do þou as Ihesu dyd yn dede, And þou shalt no man hyt forbede, Ne morë þan he ded Iudas, Þat haddë do ful grete trespas.” he ?aue hyt to alle with myldë mode whan brede was turned to flessh &amp; blode. For some þat hyt takeþ, hyt shal hem saue, And some þarforë peyne shal haue; Aftyr þey are of synnë clene, So shal hyt on hem be sene.” ?yt preyde he God of morë grace, Þat he my?t knowë hem by face, Þe whyche receyued hyt wurþyly, And whyche to have hyt were wurþy. And God graunted hym hys wyl, To knowe þe godë fro þe yl. Þe folk þat to þe prestë went For to receyue þe sacrament, Of some þe faces were as bry?t As þe sunne ys, ón days ly?t; And some, here vysages al blake, Þat no þyng my?t hem blaker make; And somë were as rede as blode, Staryng ry?t as þey had be wode; And sum were swolle, þe vyseges stout, As þo? here y?en shulde burble out; And sum gnapped here fete &amp; handes, As doggës doun þat gnawe here bandes; And sum hadde vysages of meselrye; And some were lyke foule maumetrye: Many wundrys were on hem sene, Mo þan he my?t se at þat tyme. Þe prest, whan he say alle þys, Of þat sy?t he gan hym grys; For þat sy?t was hydous, And dreful, and perylous. ?yt preyd he God, with gode entent, Þat he my?t wyte, what al þat ment; And God almy?ty loued hym weyl, And wuldë shewe hym euerydeyl; “Þo men þat are so bry?t As þe sun, on day[e]s ly?t, Þo men are ?yt yn charyte, And clene of synne, &amp; wurschepeþ me; Þo men þat were so blake, Þat no þyng my?t hem blaker make, Þey are lecchours foule with-ynne, And haue no wyl to leue here synne; Þo men þat werë rede as blode, Þey are Irus, and wykked of mode, here euene crystyn for to slo with deþ, or, with pyne do wo; Þo þat þou sagh with swolle vysage, Þey are enuyous ouer outrage; And þo þat gnapped here finger endes, Are bakbyters betwyxë frendys; Þo þat þou sagh, meselles be sy?t, Þey loue more gode þan God almy?t; Þo þat þou sagh lyke maumetrye, On worldly þyng þey most affye; More loue þey gode þat hé haþ sent þan þey do hym þat alle haþ lent; þese maner men are ?yt yn wyl, yn here synne to lyuë stylle; And þarfore shal þe sacrament On hem aske hardë Iugëment, Þat þey haue receyue hyt vnwurþyly, And serued þe fende, hys enemy. Þys tale y tolde for loue of þo Þat yn synne to housel go, Or beþ yn wylle to turne a?eyn; For alle here trauayle þey do yn veyn. ?yf þou, whan þy housel shalt take, Be yn wylle þy synne to forsake For euermore yn stedfaste herte, Þogh þou synne sone aftyr, and smert, ?yt God takeþ hyt nat to so grete grym As ?yf þou yn tresoun receyuedest hym. yn no þyng wote y more tresun, Þan brynge þy lorde to hys felun; And ?yt men sey here synne ys grefe, Þat bryngeþ a trew man on a þefe; And ?yf þou do þus, þy wytande, þan chargë men hyt most yn hande; þarfore loke þat þou wyte no?t, No synne hyde yn herte ne þo?t, Ne wyl nat wyte for neuer more whan þou receyuest God ry?t þore. Also þe clerk þat haunteþ synne, But he leue, and þer-of blynne, He shal nat serue at þe auter, Noþer halewed þyng to comë ner. Y touched langer of þys outrage whan y spake of sacrylage, Þat þe holy gost shewed hym no?t For þe dekene synned yn þo?t, Yn þe tale of Ion Crysostomus; Þys tale ys tolde for ?ow and vs. Also he ys wurþy to be shent, Þat, sone aftyr þe sacrament, To foly and to synne hym draweþ: lytyl of Goddes veniaunce hym aweþ. ?yf þou forgete or ouersyttes Tyme of housel, þat þou weyl wytes, lytel fors of hym þou ?yues, Þou louest hym nat þat þou by lyues, And ouer alle þyng he loueþ þe beste, And þou ne wylt, a ny?tys geste, lete hym herber yn hys hous; Þou art vnkynde ry?t merueylous, Þat alle þe ?ere þou latest hym weyue, And with wurschyþ þou wylt nat hyt receyue. God manaceþ swyche, for swyche enchesun, And ry?t hyt wyl, and gode resun; For swychë men are holde vntrewe Yn þe olde lawe, and eke yn þe newe. Comaundement yn þe olde lawe was, ‘Ones yn þe ?ere to shewe þy trespas;’ þe newe law ys of more onour ‘Ones to receyue þy creatoure,’ Ones yn þe ?erë, to knowleche, Þy lorde to pes, for drede of wreche. Þat prest, y blame ouer alle þyng, Þat with-oute skylle lettyþ to synge; For many a soulë my?t be saued with þe messe þat he haþ leued; For al[lë] þat yn peynë ys, Abydeþ þe socoure of þe messe; For euery messe makeþ memórye Of soules þat are yn purgatórye; Mochë þanke shal þat prest haue, Þat helpeþ, hem for to saue; For no þyng may hem so moche auayle Of here peyne and here trauayle, As þe sacrament of þe autere, Ne makeþ hem of peyne so clere. And þat may y shewe apertly By a tale of seint Gregorye; Seynt Gregory telleþ for þe same, [The Tale of the Priest who was waited on by a Dead Lord whom he afterwards sang out of Purgatory.] þer was a prest, Felyx was hys name; Bysyde hys wonyng yn a paþ was a wasshyng yn an hote baþ Þys prest þedyr oftë ?ede To wasshe hym whan he haddë nede. Þys prest þere euer redy fonde A man þat serued hym to fote and honde; he drogh hys hosen of, and hys shone, And efte was redy hem on to done; At euery tyme þat he þedyr cam, hys shone and hys hosen, of he nam, And serued hym at euery a tyde, Yn þe water, and eke besyde. Þys prest, þat cam þedyr so ofte, Þat þys man serued so softe, he ne asked hym neuer more when he was, ne how he come þore; But euery tymë was redy And serued hym peynyblëly. Þys prest þo?t he serued hym weyl, “hys trauayle wyl y quyte sum deyl.” On o day he þedyr þo?t, And, twey loues with hym he bro?t; yn-to þe baþ, ?ede þe prest, And, wesshe hym, as he dyd neste: Þys man was þere hym a?ayne; To serue hym weyl, he dyde hys mayne; Þys preste, whan he shuld furþë go, He ?aue þe man þese louës two, And þanked hym moche, hys seruyse, And more he wuldë ouþer wyse. Þys man answered þe prest a?eyn: “Þys brede þou bro?test to me yn veyn, For neuer morë shal y ete Bredë, ne noun ouþer mete. Y am a man, þat ys dede, Þat neuer more shal etë brede.” Þe preste asked “on what manere Ys hyt þat þou wonest þus here?” Þys yche man answered and seyd, “Y was lorde here, are y deyde; And þys seruyse þat y am ynne, ys þe peynë for my synne; But y pray þe, pur charyte, Offre on þe auter þese loues for me; And y beseche þe, ouer alle þyng, Þat syxe messys for me þou synge, For, were þey sunge, y hope to wende Yn-to þe ioye with-outen ende. whan þe syxtë messe ys lefte, ?yf þou ne fyndë me here efte, know þou þan soþëly ywys Þat for þy prayere y am bro?t yn blys.” þys prest, alle þat wokë long, Fór þys same man preyd and song; And whan þe wokë was alle gone, Þe prest cam þedyr, and fondë none. he beleued þan weyl þat he was bro?t To blys, for, he fonde hym no?t. By þys tale þan mowe ?e se, þat hyt ys grete charyte, Messes for the dede to synge, Þe soulës oute of þyne to brynge. Passyng alle þyng, hyt haþ powere, Þe sacrament of þe autere, And namëly whan hyt ys doun with godë mannes deuocyun; Hym, wyl God sunner here þan one þat ys nat hym so dere. yn þe seuenþe comaundement Toucheþ to þys sacrament, Yn a talë of a kny?t, How þe prest þat lyueþ nat ry?t, Of hys preyer ys lytyl prowe, And þere telleþ hyt weyl how; And y shal telle a-nouþer here, Of a messë of a frere. [The Tale of the Suffolk Man who was taken out of Purgatory by two Masses his Wife got sung for him.] A man yn Souþfolke onës deyde Besydë Sudbyry, men seyde. For þat man, swych grace was dy?t, Þat hym was graunted to come a ny?t For to spekë wyþ hys wyfe To amende þe defaute of hys lyfe: “?yf a messe were for me doun with gode mannes deuocyoun, y hope,” he seyd, “to blys go, And be delyuerd of alle my wo; Y prey þe, pur charyte, To trauayle so moche for me.” She graunted hym þat ychë bone, And ros vp on þe mornë sone, And, vn-to þe frerës ?ede, For þere hoped she best to spede. She cam, and spak with a frere, And preyd she my?t hys messë here, And for here housbunde soule to synge, And she wulde ?yuë hym offrynge. Þe frere ded here a messe yn comune, as þe seruyse ys; whan þys messë sungë was She went home a godë pas. Þe ny?t aftyr, þan come he, “Slepest þou?” he seyd; ‘nay,’ seyd she, ‘Be ?e ?yt,’ she seyd, ‘yn blys? þe messë for ?ow sungen ys.’ “þe messe,” he seyde, “þou dedyst be do, A party hyt halpë þer-vn-to; My parte y had, of þat messe, As of þyng þat comune ys; ?yf one for me were specyale seyde, Þat ouþer for me blys had nede,— ?yf þe prest were of lyfe so gode Þat God hys preyer vndyrstode— Y hopë þan, grace to haue, Þat hys messë my?t me saue.” Ofte he seyd[ë] to hys wyfe “A prest! A prest! of clenë lyfe.” On þe mornë, sone she ?ede To þe frerës eft god spede, And shewed hyt to þe pryour, And prey[ed] hym of socour, ‘?yf he had any broþer, Þat he hoped, were better þan oþer, Þat wyl syngë me a messe For a man þat dedë ys; And at myn esë he shal haue, To a pytaunce, þat he wyl craue.’ Þe pryor spake vn-to a frere, And prey[ed] hym on alle manere Þat he wulde a messë synge For þat soule þat she made preyng. Þe frerë was an holy man; And ar þat he hys messe bygan, He preyde to God hys orysoun Yn ful grete afflyccyoun, Þat hyt my?t be, hym to pay, Þe messe þat he shulde synge þat day. whan þe messe was do to ende, He bad þe womman home to wende; “And, whan þou more eftë heres, Cum and sey to ourë freres.” Þe ny?t aftyr, lesteneþ now, He come, and seyd, “slepest þou?” ‘Nay,’ she sayd, ‘how farë ?e?’ “weyl,” he seyd, “and so wurþ þe.”most þou ‘were ?e pay[ed] of þat messe, Þat, for ?ow, sungyn ys?’ “?e,” he seyd, “graunte mercy, Þys messe to me ys more wurþy Þan alle þe worlde, an hunder syþe, Ne my?t haue made me halfe so blyþe; hys preyer was to God so dere, Þat he besoghte, þat wlde he here, ?yf he had preyd for an hundred mo, Fro pyne to blys, he had bro?t þo; For what þyng he hade asked bone, God had graunted hyt hym as sone; And haue gode day, for now y wende To þe ioye with-outyn ende.” God late vs neuer þer-of mysse, with-outyn ende to haue þat blys! Þys wyfe come sonë on þe morne, And fyl on knees þe frere byforne, And toldë hym weyl, euery deyl, How he, for hys prayer, yn ioye was weyl; And þe frere ful weyl þarby lete, And þanked God; and for ioye he grete.wepte weyl were hym at hys endyng Þat had swych a prest for hym to synge! Yn þys tale, þan, shewed ys, Ouer alle gode þan ys þe messe; For þe sacrament of þe autere Oueral passeþ hys powere; Yn þat messe, þey hem affye, Þe soules þat are yn purgatorye, For hyt makeþ mencyun of þe passyun As Ihesu Cryst to deþ was doun; Þe sone ys offred to þe fadyr yn heuene For þe soules þat þe prest wyl neuene. Also, þys talë wyl mene Þat þe preste be gode and clene; Þan wyl Ihesu Cryst hym here, For what þyng he makeþ preyere: Preye he for body, or for soule, Þat ys yn pyne, or here yn noye, Boþe wyl God almy?ty saue, what-so þe godë prest wyl craue. Nat only for soules ys he herd, But also for vs, yn þys world; Be a man yn sykenes, or yn prysoun, weyferyng, or yn temptacyun, Or yn any ouþer trauayle, Þe sacrament wyl vs auayle; hyt wyl delyuer vs out of peyne, ?yf oure beleuë be certeyne; And þat was weyl shewed yn dede Yn Ingland, so seyþ seynt Bede; Yn hys bokys wrytyn þyr ys A feyre myrácle of þe messe. [Bede's Tale of Jumna and Tumna; or, How an Abbot's Mass-singing made the Fetters fall off a Knight in Prison.] what tyme seynt Bede was man lyuand, were many kyngës yn þys land; Betwyxë tweyn was grete batayle, For whych þyng y telle þys merueyle; þe toon hyght Edfryde of þe norþe cuntre, þe toþer of Lyndëseye was he: Edfryde had grete seygnourye, Seynt Audre housbonde, of Ely. þys batayle was, þurgh here boþe assent, Besyde a watyr, men calle Trent: Syre Edfrydes broþer hy?t Elfwynne, He was slayn þe batayle ynne; On boþe partyys, ne was none So feyre a kny?t of flesshe and bone, Ne so do?ty was of armes; Þarfore seynt Bede pleyneþ hys harmys. An noþer kn?yt also was felte dowun Almoste dede, and fyl yn swoun: Þe namë of þys ?ungë kny?t, ‘Iumna,’ seyþ seynt Bede, he hy?t. whan þys Iumna had long leyn, He couerd, and sette hym vp a?eyn, And stopped hys woundes, þey shuld nat blede, And as he my?t, þennë he ?ede To seke hym helpe agher to haue, Or frendës fynde, þat hym my?t saue. And as he wente with mochë drede, He was take with kyng Eldrede, And, broght vn-to a lordyng, An Erle þat heldë of þat kyng. Þe Erle asked hym ‘what he was, And where he had be yn hard kas?’ For drede of deþ, he was affry?t, And durst nat sey he was a kny?t; He seyd, “seyre, ?yf þy wyl be, Y am an husband of þe cuntre; Y was wunt to lede vytayle To kny?tës þat were yn batayle; And now y am a porë man, Yn þys maner fro þe batayle wan, And wyl fonde to saue my lyfe Tyl y may comë to my wyfe.” Þe erle þan made a leche be stoundes Tende to hym, to hele hys woundes. Þat tyme were here many thedys, Many vságes yn many ledys; For euery kyng, yn þat dawe, Beleued on dyuers lawe; Sum were crystyn, on oure fay, And some beleued on paynyms lay; Þarfore þat tyme was mykyl þro, And ofte was boþë werre and wo; ?yf any kyng my?t of oþers men take, He shuld hem selle, or yn seruage make. wharfore y telle so of þys kny?t, þe erle dyd hym bynde euery ny?t þat he ne shuld[ë] fro hem fle, Ne stele awey to hys cuntre; Noþeles, for alle þat þey my?t hym bynde, A-noþer tyme, lose, þey my?t hym fynde; Só fast, þey neuer hym bonde, Þat lose a-noþer tyme þey hym fonde. Þys boundë kny?t hyght Iumna, And had a broþer þat hy?t Tumna; þys Tumna was prest relygyous, For he was abbot of an house; So long he leued yn þat estretoune Þat for hys name he hy?t Tuncestre; Þat tounne, as y vndyrstande, hyt was yn Northhumber-lande. þys abbot herd tydyng certeyn Þat Iumna was yn batayle slayn; He come to Trent, þys abbot Tumna, And fonde a body ry?t lyke Iumna; Onóurablye he dyd hyt graue Yn hys cherche, þere he wulde hyt haue, And song þarforë, day and ouþer, For he went he had be hys broþer. Þogh þat Tumna had chose wrong, hys broþer had þe godenesse of hys song; For God alle wote, and wyst hyt þere For whom he madë hys preyere; how as euer men, þys kny?t at eue bonde, Þe bondes, on þe morne, vndo þey fonde; Men my?t neuer hym yn bondes so feste Þat þey þat tyme ne gunne al to-braste. Þo men þat had þys man yn holde, Þys wundyr to þe erle þey tolde; Þe erle had þer-of gretë wundyr Þat hys bondes were so a sunder, He seyd ‘hym self wulde with hym speke, To wytë why hys bondes dyd breke.’ Before þe erlë was he fette, And þe erle, ful feyre he grette, “Sey me now,” he seyd, “bele amye, “kanst þou weyl on sorcerye? Sum wycchecrafte þou doust aboute bere, Þat þy bondes mow þe nat dere. For soþe,” he seyd, “sum what þou dos, Þat euer-more þey fynde þe los.” he seyd, “on whycchecrafte beleue y no?t, Ne for me shal none be wro?t, Ne wyl nat be, þurgh fendys crafte, Vnbonde, ne with no whycchëcrafte. Syre erle,” he seyd, “hyt ys a-nouþer; Yn my cuntre y haue a broþer Þat supposyþ weyl þat y am slayn, For y come nat home agayn; For me he syngeþ euery day a messe; Prest, and abbot, for soþe he ys; Y wote weyl, þát ys þe enchesun Þat my bondes are so ondoun, For, no þyng haþ powere A?ens þe sacrement of þe autere; And ?yf y were dede yn ouþer werlde, hys preyer shulde for me be herde, To bryngë me of pyne and wo And aftyrward to blys[së] go.” Alle þe meyne þan, and þe erle, Supposed weyl he was no cherle, As he to hem byfore hadde seyd, whan þey on hym fyrst handës leyd; By hys semblant and feyre beryng Hym semed weyl to be a lordyng; By hys speche, þey vndyrstode Þat he was man of gentyl blode. Þe erle toke hym yn pryuyte; Of when he was, telle hym shulde he; “Sey me þe soþe, and, as y am kny?t, Þou ne shalt haue for me, skaþe ne ply?t.” “Syn ?e me behete ?oure pes and gryth, Y am þe kyngës man Edfryth; Armës y bare yn þe batayle, with alle my powere hym to auayle.” “So me þo?t,” seyd þe erle, “Þe semed nat to be a cherle; But, for þát y here þe seye, Þou were wurþy for to deye, For þou hylpë þer to slo, Þat alle my kyn ys dede me fro; But, langer þat y sykerd þe, Shalt þou haue no skaþe for me.” He ?ede and solde hym for raunsoun At London to a Frysoun,— A Frysoun ?e shul vndyrstande To a marchaunde of Fryslande;— Þys Frysun wulde þys man furþe lede, And, dyd on hym bondes for drede; For he ne shulde skape by þe weye, He dyd on hym, bondes for to leye; But hyt auayled hym no þyng Neuer a day, þat byndyng; For yn þat oure þat þe messe was sunge, Þe bondes to-braste, and alle to-sprunge. Þys Frysoun þo?t ‘how may þys be? hé may ry?t weyl fro me fle; Chaunsfullyche hyt vayled no?t, þe katel þat y wyþ hym bo?t.’ þe Frysoun seyd, “wylt þou weyl Restore a?en alle my katel, And y shal ?yue þe leue to go To þy cuntre, þere þou come fro; But fyrst þou shalt me trouþë plyght, And trewly holde hyt at alle þy my?t, To brynge þe katel, and ?yue for þe, And ellës y grauntë þe nat fre.” he graunted hym alle þat he seyd, And trouþe yn hande with hand[ë] leyd. þys Iumna went to þe kyng Loyre, þat was kyng of Kaunterbyre; he was seynt Audre syster sone, And Iumna was wonte with here to wone; Of alle hys state, boþe wo and wele, Iumna tolde þe kyng euery deyl; Þe kyng þan ?aue hym hys raunsoun, And he bare hyt to Londoun to þe Frysoun. Syþen ?ede he home, þys kny?t Iumna, To hys broþer þe abbot Tumna, And tolde hym of alle hys wo-fare, And of alle hys cumforte yn alle hys care. Þe abbot ful weyl þan vndyrstode Þat hys messe dyd hym grete gode, And þat þe sacrament gan hym borowe Oute of seruage and out of sorowe. Þys tale telleþ vs seynt Bede, Yn þe gestys of Inglond þat we rede. By þys talë, mow men lere Þat þe messe helpeþ vs weyl here; For vs lyuyng, hyt makeþ memórye, As weyl as for soules yn purgatórye; Euery man shal beleue þat ry?t, Þat holpe wyl be, as was þe kny?t.

[The Tale of the Miner, and how his Wife's Offerings for his Soul fed him while he was buried alive in a Mine.] Þyr was a man be?unde þe see, A mynour, woned yn a cyte,— Mynurs, þey make yn hyllys holes, As yn þe west cuntre men seke coles.— Þys mynur so?te stones vndyr þe molde, Þat men make of, syluer and golde; he wro?t on a day, and holed yn þe hyl; A perylous chauncë to hym fyl; For, a grete party of þat yche myne Fyl dowun yn þe hole, and closed hym ynne. hys felaus alle, þat were hym hende, Þat he were dede, weyl soþely wende; Þey ?ede and toke hem alle to rede, And tolde hys wyfe þat he was dede.

Some men, whan here synne ys wro?t, Hyt no more cumþ yn here þo?t, And ?yueþ no fors, þat he for?eteþ hys synne; and hym þe fend eteþ. leuer ys hym late hem alle weyue, þan any hard penaunce receyue. ?yf þou wylt haue þe sacrament, Þe behoueþ ?yue weyl bettyr entent, And recordë euery dede with sorow of herte, and with drede, And forþynke, with mochë mone, Þat þou ne mayst þenk on echone; And ?yf þou shryue þe euery deyl Of þo, þat þe meneþ weyl, Þat þou ne lettë for no shame To tellë opunly þy blame: Swyche a man þat þus ys shryue, May be asoyled, and penaunce ?yue. penaunce may be ?yue to none But he shryue hys synnes echone, And be of godë répentaunce; No prest may elles ?yue hym penaunce; Penaunce pyneþ þy flessh and þe fende, And plesyþ God, and makyþ hym frende. Aftyr, ?yf þou þenk on þat Synne þat þou yn shryfte for?at, Þou art holde to telle hyt þy prest whan þou hast mynde þer-of yn brest. whan þou hast þy synne forsake, And þy penaunce þer-forë take, For?ete nat þan þat þou ne do Þe penaunce þat he ioyneþ þe to. ?yf þou for?etest, þou shalt bey hyt harde yn purgatórye aftyrwarde; For o day þat þou for?etest here, A ?ere, þere þou shalt by hyt dere. And ?yf þou fallest eft yn synne, Efte þy shryfte alle newe bygynne, And do gode dedës þer-with-alle, For þat es of penaunce pryncypalle; ?yf þou ne do, verrement Þou synnest yn þys sacrament; For of þat man, hyt ys grete drede, Þat wyþdraghþ hym fro godë dede. Many man also þenkeþ þys þo?t, ‘þat werk of penaunce auayleþ no?t þe whylys þat he ys yn synne;’ But þan had he most nede to bygynne; For godë dedës and penaunce Reysyn a man to répentaunce; For many þyngës, gode hyt ys, Þogh hyt auayle hym naght yn blys. þe prest wote neuer what he menes, Þat for lytyl, curseþ hys parysshenes; Þat yche shepard ?yueþ no gode kepe, Þat betecheþ þe wulfe hys shepe; At þe last acounte shal he mysfalle, whan he shal answere for hem alle; And þe lordë shal þe shepard hate, þat wasteþ hys store, and bryngeþ o gate; Þe lordë bo?t þe shepe ful dere, lese hem nat þan so ly?tly here; Þo? þey outrage, and do foly, He shal nat sle hem with felony; he shal hem chastyse with smert speche, with small baytynges, and nat with wreche. As þe gode shepard kepyþ hys shepe, So shalle þe prest, hys parysshenes kepe; Þere shepe gone wrong besyde þe paþ, Þe shepard cryeþ for drede of skaþe; And ?yf þey wyl nat at hys crye Turne a?en to here pasture nye, Þan setteþ he on hys hounde, And bayteþ hem a wel gode stounde, And bryngeþ hem to her pasture weyl, Ne sleþ he ?yt none, neuer a deyl. with þese prestes hyt shulde fare so, whan here parysshenes oghte mysdo; wyþ feyre techyng, and godë spelles, And stoutly, whan þey wyl nat elles, And with ordynaryys of holy cherche, Tyl þat þey wyl ry?tly werche; Nat with cursyng, þat es slaghter euyl, So sone betake hem to þe deuyl. Haue to hem swych charyte As þou wuldest God hadde to þe; kowardyse hyt ys, and foule maystry, To þrowe a faucoun at euery flye; Of flyes men mow hem weyl spourge, And þrowe to hem naght but a scourge; No more shal no prest þrawe, But a scorge, þat ys loue awe. Lewed man, þou shalt cursyng doute, And to þy prest þou shalt nat stoute; Be he wykked, or be he gode, Þou shalt to hym be þolëmode. Hyt ys nat a lytyl þyng For to fallë yn cursyng, For hyt reueþ þe þy gostly frendes, And betecheþ þe vn-to þe fendes, And hyt forbarreþ alle gode dedes Þat þe shuld helpe yn alle þy nedes, Tyl þou com to amendëment with penaunce, þat ys, þys sacrament. Yn sacrylage, y tolde a tale how cursyng breweþ mochë bale, Þat alle þe ?ere hopped aboute, Þat wulde nat þe prestys byddyng doute. Now wyl we leuë, at þys tyme, Of penaunce morë for to ryme, For y shal tellë þer-of more At shryftë, whan y comë þore; God ?yue me gracë so to telle, To shamë alle þe fendes of helle! [Of the Fifth Sacrament—Holy Orders.] Now of þe fyfþë sacrament, Þe order of þe bysshopes presentement. þys falleþ to þese lordynges, As popës, emperoures, and kynges, And to alle þat clerkys auaunce To holy cherches portynaunce; Swyche men, þat are of grete nobley, Yn þys sacrament þan synne þey, Þat þey graunte, for mede þat þey take, Vnwurþyly, a bysshope to make, Of whom þat ys þe famë ryfe Þat he ys, of febyl lyfe, Or oþer to auaunce, hyt ys folye, wyþoutyn resonable clergye. Clerk behoueþ hym for to be, Þat shulde receyue swyche dygnyte For to gouerne holy cherche; with clergy, behoueþ hym algate werche. But now ys fulfylled þe prophecye Þat, sorë wepyng, seyþ Isaye, “Ry?t swych shal be þe prest As þe lewed man lyue, þou sest.” lytyl kan lasse þe lewed man þan some of þesë prestës kan. who ?yuen hem more to worldly þyng þan prestës do, for alle here prechyng? ?yf he be clerk, and euyl dous, Of hym ys nat to make no rous. what vayleþ to vndyrstonde þe lettyr, And hys lyfe be neuer þe bettyr? Alle þat clergye, y telle it but lore, when he lyueþ neuer þe bettyr þer-fore. But how seyþ Salamon yn hys spellyng, “wo þe land, þere chylde ys kyng!” And wo þe folk, þat kan nat lyue whan holy cherchë ys mys-?yue! And to þe husbonde, wo ys hys lyfe, þat haþ yn hys hous a fole to wyfe! ?e lordes, do ?e Goddes ordynaunce, And godë men ?e shul auaunce; To gode men ?yueþ ?oure benefyces Þat kun hem kepe fro wykked vyces; Þan make ?e gode presentëment To order of þys sacrament. Also, haþ he wykkedly doun Þat letteþ gode mannes eleccyoun; ‘Eleccyoun’ ys, ‘weyl chesyng A gode man to kepe holy þyng.’ Þese hyghë men do grete trespas, Þat chese nat ry?t, alas! alas! Þát were wurþy, hem þey spare, And þe vnwurþy auaunced are; And, þat ys nat lytyl synne To hem þat hyt ?yuen, and eke so wynne; Hyt may be tolde for symonye, For ?yfte to auaunce þe vnwurþy. By a tale, y may ?ow shewe þat hyt ys synne to chese a shrewe; And ?yt ys he yn wers entent, þat letteþ gode mannes auauncëment. Seynt Gregory telleþ þarfore a tale þat telþ many one, what grete and smale, he telleþ mo hymself a-lone, þan alle þe doctours do echone. [The Tale of Paschasius's Punishment for not agreeing to the Election of the best Man for Pope.] Yn þe cherche of Rome, he telleþ þus, A dekene was þat hyghte Pascasyus, A man of almës þan was he, Þat ofte of þe porë had pyte; Þat yche tyme was elleccyone To chese here pope, as er was wone. Twey men were yn choys to take, Oþer Laurence, oþer Symake; hys felaus alle, Symakus chese, So þat Laurence hys voys lese; Pascasyus graunted neuer þartyl, But chese Laurence at hys owne wyl; He repented hym neuer no?t, But yn Laurencë stode hys þo?t. Yn þys popes tyme, syre Symakus, Deyde þe dekene Pascasyus: Þys dekene was an holy man, As yn þe cuntre þe famë ran, And dyd þys myrácle, as ?e mowe here: A wode man touched on hys bere, And a party of hys cloþyng, And a-none he hadde botenyng. longë, aftyr þat þys was, Fyl of þys dekene a merueylous kas; For þere besydë, yn a paþ was a wasshyng, at an hote baþ; ‘Termes’ men calle þat watyr wasshele, For many one had þerat here hele. Þus þe holy bysshope seynt Germyne Com þedyr to be wasshe þer-ynne; Þere fonde he þys dekene Pascas, And at þe watyr seruyng was: Þys bysshope merueyled yn hys þo?t, wheþer hyt were Pascas or no?t; At þe laste, seynt Germyne seyde “Art þou nat Pascas þat deyde, Þat we helde a man holy?” “?ys,” seyd Pascas, “hyt am y; And at þys water, serue y þus, For y graunted neuer to Symakus, But to Laurence, with alle my my?t, Þat was nat so gode yn Goddys sy?t; y ne repented yn alle my hope, For y wulde haue hadde hym pope. But wuldest þou prey for me, Germyne, y shulde come sone oute of þys pyne; And þat mayst þou wete yn þys manere, ?yf þou fynde me no more here.” Þe bysshope Germyne, home he ?ede, And preyd to God for hys mysdede. Þe nextë tyme þat he come þore, Of Pascas, sagh he no more. Lokë, lordes, how ?e mysdo, Þat eleccyoun dystroubleþ so; For a ?yfte, or a presént, ?e suffre holy cherche to be shent; ?ourë synnë shal be greuous, whan þys dekene Pascasyus, For so lytyl, to purgatorye ?ede, For whom was shewed myrácle yn dede. A?ens God, he ys nat quyte, Þat suffreþ for hys owne profyte, Holy cherche, wrongly be ?yue To þo men þat wykkedly lyue; Þey shul be a-couped of tresoun, As traytours yn eleccyoun; Many shul go a deuyl wey, Or be encumbred or þey dey. ?yt shal y telle, among þese talys, A tale þat now late fyl yn Wales: yn þe tyme of seynt Dauy Fyl þys þyng, a grete ferly. [A Tale of Warning against buying Bishoprics, and worshipping Bad Bishops' Bodies.] As þe munkës shulde do werche werk þat fyl vn-to here cherche, As þey dalue dowun yn þe clay, Þey fonde a bysshope alle hole lay, with flesshe and blode, and hole sendal, And, wyþ ouþer vestement alle, As fresshë as he were depeynt. þey wende he had be a corseynt; þey toke hym vp, euerychone, And, leyd hym vppon a stone, And wurscheped hyt moche with-alle, For þey wende myrácles shulde falle. At hygh feste tymës of þe ?ere Þey ensensed þe body as þe hygh autere. A ny?t, whan þe sekesteyn yn bede was leyd, Hym þo?t one come, and to hym seyd, “Ensense þe body no more so, Ne do no wurschep þar-vnto.” Þe sekesteyn, for alle þat defense, ?yt he ?aue þe body ensense. Anouþer ny?t, fór þat same, Efte þe sekesteyn he gan blame, and seyd, “holde hyt no more yn prys, þat yche body, þat þere lys.” þe munkë seyd, “telle me why þat he to wurschep ne ys wurþy.” “loke to morne, and þou mayst wyte what lyþ yn hys mytyr wryte.” Þe munkë ros vp on þe morne, And, fonde yn hys mytyr horne Þesë verse wryte on a scrowe, For þat he shulde þe bettyr trowe: Þese are þo ychë twey verse, Þat to holynes are reuers, Quem lapis ille tegit, sandalia viliter emit; Estuat in baratro, pessimus ille latro. “he þat þys stone hyleþ one lyche, wykkedly bo?t hys bysshopryche. yn helle he welleþ pynë grefe, For alþerwerst þan was he þefe.” Alþerwerst þen shal hem be, Þat for mede come to dygnyte. hyt ys nat to speke, ne to preche, Þe clergye werche moche aftyr wreche. Ne þou shalt no dedë werche, Noþer to iangle, yn holy cherche; Namely yn tyme of holy feste, Þán shuldë men iangle leste. Þat tyme make many one, gaderyng yn holy cherche of ydul þyng; And of alle shalt þou ?elde acounte, To whos godenesse hyt shuld amounte. y haue touched of þys outrage whan y spake of sacrylage. Ne þou oghtes nat to be enchesun To sturble mannys deuocyoun. ?yf þou ne wylte Goddes seruyse here, lette none ouþer of here preyere; Fole ys, þat foly þat wyl nat drede, And more þat letteþ alle oþer gode dede. Ry?t so seyþ Salamon þe wyse, Vs alle of foly to chastyse. Clerk to bete, or handes on ley yn vyolence, hyt ys grete eye; Hyt longeþ to þys sacrament Þurgh bysshopës commaundëment; yn sacrylagë þer y spake, y touched of þat ychë lak; And yn þe ten commaundëmens, y wene y touched of þys defens; Þarforë, now hyt ys beste, Of þys sacrament to reste. God grauntë þesë lordynges, weyl to do yn allë þynges, And late hem neuer here soulës lese For no wrongës þat þey chese! [Of the Sixth Sacrament,—Marriage.] The syxte sacrament ys matrymony, Þére hyt ys do ry?twusly; God comaundeþ yn hys boke Þat man shuldë hyt weyl loke; For he stabled hyt yn paradys, hyt ys holde yn þe morë prys; And yn Kana Galyle He turnede water yn wyne to be. A?ens þys ychë sacrament Do many onë verrement; yn þys, do þo men ful ylle, Þat wedden any a?ens here wylle; Here wyl behoueþ to-gedyr consente, Are þe prest do þe sacrament. Ne þou ne shalt [not] do þy my?t Þat two be weddyd with vnry?t. Synne þou wystest þat þey shulde no?t with no skyl togedyr be bro?t, Þou synnest moche þurgh þys resun, For þey mow neuer be weyl vndoun. Ne þou shalt nat, for no gode— þo?t hyt be þyn ownë blode— Dysturble hyt þere hyt o?t to be, ?yf þey haue do hére wyl fre. ?yf þou wost þe soþe of euery deyl, Þat two are weddyd, and o?t nat weyl, But þou shewe hyt, þou dost grete synne To one þat may do bote þer-ynne; For, þus ys þe gospel sawe, And þe same seyþ landës lawe, ‘Þat who so consenteþ to a þefe, Euene peyne shul þey haue grefe.’ Of foly trouþës þat are ?yue, Þare-of byfore y haue ?ow shryue; Y haue tolde hyt as y couþe, How men falsen here trouþes with mouþe; whan y spake of lecherye, Y spakë þer of þat foly, And yn þe syxtë commaundment Þere spekþ hyt of þys asent; Þarfore nedeþ me nat here To spekë more of þys matere; But, y pray euery man Þat hys crystendom loueþ, or kan, Þat þey neuer swych þyng graunte, Two to wedde of fals cunnaunte; For many come neuer yn wedlak But for þe fyrst cunnaunt þat men spak. Also, for men by-hete hem largely, Are chyldryn wedded ofte for-þy; For þyr are many wedded for gode, And for no stedfast loue of blode, And, þat ys no ry?t weddyng; Hyt quemeþ nat to heuene kyng. Many one weddeþ euery deyl For þe loue of syre kateyl; whan hyt ys go, and ys alle bare, Þan ys þe weddyng sorowe &amp; kare; loue ande catel þan ys awey, And ‘welaweye’ þey cry and sey. And ?e men þat brekyn cunnaunte, ?e selfe falsen þat ?e fyrst graunte; Þan ys weddelak þurgh ?ow shent, Þat was þe fyrst sacrament; Þe shende hyt wyþ ?oure fals behetyng, And þey no?t weddë but þe þyng; So, betwyxe fals and coueytous, ys welaweyë bro?t to hous. Of þys my?t men mochë speke, But leuer ys me my mouþe to steke Þan y spak o?t oute of skore, For sone y my?t be blamed þarfore. God ?yue hem grace, þo þat shul wedde, Yn ry?t wedlak be bro?t to bedde; And delyuer hem of here wyues Þat oute of skyle chyden and stryues! [Of the Seventh Sacrament,—Aneylyng or Extreme Unction.] Now of þe seuenþe sacrament: Þese clerkys kalle hyt ‘oynament,’ On Englys hyt ys ‘anelyng’ whan man shal make hys endyng; Seynt Iamë stable[d] hyt for to be A sacrament þurgh crystyanyte. ?yf þou aske hyt wyþ gode wyl, Of wykked gostes gest þou noun yl, Ne þe fende haþ no powere þy body for to comë nere. ?yf þou of dedly synne be shryue, þo þat are venyal beþ þe for?yue; þou mayst þan sykerly go þy weye, what tyme as euer þat þou shalt deye. ?e þat loue þys sacrament, Here mowe ?e lerne, ?yueþ gode entent. Þat tymë þat þou shalt wende, And draghest vn-to þy lyuës ende, Þou shalt aske deuoutëly Anelyng to þy body; Þo?t hyt be bro?t redy to þe, Asked behoueþ hyt algate be. ?yf þou vnwetyng hyt haue, hyt helpeþ þe nat so moche to saue As ?yf þou asked hyt by name; Þus seyþ þe apostle seynt Iame; For whan þou askest hyt with gode wyl, Þou mekyst þe þan to fulfyl Þe sacramentes of holy cherche with beleue, and gostely to werche; Þan ys holy cherche holde þurgh ry?t To pray for þe boþe day and ny?t. Hyt ys to be holde yn prys, For hyt saueþ man on twey partys; Þe soule hyt bryngeþ to saluacyoun, And for hele of body hyt ys doun. But many one þus hope and seye, ‘Anele hem nat but þey shulde deye; For ?yf he turne a?en to lyfe, He shulde lygge no more by hys wyfe.’ Al þo þat beleueþ þys, wykkedly þey beleue a-mys. Holy cherche makeþ no menyng, For swyche þyng defende anelyng; But yn euery an euyl strong— lygge þou shortë whyle or long— Þou shalt aske þys sacrament, with gode wyl and gode entent, Syn hyt auayleþ but lyghtly But hyt be asked derwurly. Þy gode wyl shal stonde for oght, ?yf þou hyt aske, and haue hyt no?t; For some are now a-lyue þou seest, And dede are he may haue þe preste; Þarfore, askë hyt be tyme, For, deþ cumþ now as yn swyme; yn euery sykenes, aske hyt al-weys; God almy?ty ys ry?t curteys, he seeþ þy wyl, what þou wuldest haue, Hys mercy ys þe more þe to saue. Ihesu, y þanke þe of þy grace, Þat hast lent me wyt and space, Þys yn Englys for to drawe, As holy men haue seyd yn sawe; For lewed men hyt may auayle, For hem y tokë þys trauayle. Of þys sacrament wyl y blynne; Of shryfte, to telle, y wyl bygynne; God ?yue me gracë so to seye, Of shryfte to shewë þe ry?t weye, Þat we receyue, are we be went, with-outë synne, þys sacrament. Here bygynneþ shryfte. The ly?t of grace þat neuer haþ ende, From whom al cumþ, and to al men sende; Of alle godenes, wel and bygynnyng Ys God of heuene, and of erþe kyng, Hym wurschepeþ alle, as wel ys wurþy, Gostly þynges as weyl as dedly, Alle creatures doun hym onoure, Ihesu, þat ryche emperoure; Þou, Ihesu, ly?t my soule with-ynne, And graunte me swychë to bygynne Þat hyt mowe be, þe to queme, And vs alle fro synnë ?eme! Namly, of shryftë so to seye, Þat we mow make vs redy wey A?ens þe fende, þat ys oure fo, Þarto God graunte vs alle to go. Tweluë poyntes þyr are yn shryfte, And tweluë graces of here ?yfte, And yn alle þesë, are but þre whych are to do, and whych are to fle. To telle hyt shortly, alle at gesse, Þe fyrst ys þe grete godënesse, How yt ?yueþ hem grace to þryue, Þo men þat wyl bleþely hem shryue; Syþen, fro what þyng men shulde hem loke Þat shryftë blely vndyrtoke; And how many þynges, behoueþ hem haue, Þat, ry?tly, here shryfte wyl craue. Yn tokenyng, to holde vs lowe, And oure wykkednes for to knowe, Hyt ys ordeyned, þurgh Goddys ?yfte, To man, fór to knowe oure shryfte. For vnbuxumnesse of oure fadyr Adam And Eue—þurgh prydë þat fyrst cam, Þat Goddes commaundëment þey brake— knowlachyng behoueþ vs allë make; And þurgh a-nother resun ry?t gode, Syn Ihesu Cryst toke flesshe and blode, And was cloþed yn oure man-hede, And wyst oure wykkednes &amp; oure nede, To man behoueþ vs to telle oure trespas, Syn he knew alle þat yn man was. For whan we shryue vs to þe preste, To God we shewe vs yn mannes breste; Þan wotë boþë God and man, Oure lyfe, þat alle may wete and kan; Now we shul, telle ?ow sone, what ys to leue, and what to done. The fyrste poynt of shryfte. Þe fyrst poynt of þy shryfte oweþ to be, ‘with þy gode wyl and hertë fre, whan þou art yn þy lyfë best, Awey þou shalt þy synnë kest;’ For þan wurschepest þou God aboue, And forsakest þy synne for hys loue. Dauyd seyþ, yn wurde to fulfyl, God shrofe hym with hys gode wyl; Abyde nat tyl þou most nedly, For þan hyt ys with fors and maystry; Þou shryuest þe þan for drede, Nat for loue, but more for nede; Þan semeþ hyt þat hyt shulde be Þat þy synne forsakeþ þe. Swyche shryftë made Acor þe þefe: whan he shulde go to pynë grefe, He shrof hys synne, how he hadde stole Þre þyngës þat he hade forhole, A mantle of skarlet, a rolle of golde, And syluer, he hydde vndyr molde; Yn þe byble men mow hyt se, Yn þe story of Iosue. The Secunde poynt of shryfte. þe secunde poynt ys next þyr-by, ‘þat þou shalt shryue þe hastyly;’ For whan þou doust yn longe respyte, hyt ys for?ete, þat long ys olyte. Seynt Bernard þarfore, to swych chyt, And seyþ ‘moche for?yt, þat longe abyt.’ Anouþer skyl ys, þat þou shalt hyt haste, For yn þy synne þy lyfe ys waste; For, as moche as þe tyme doþ amounte, For euery oure, shalt þou ?elde acounte, ?yf hyt so were, þou my?test had space, And wuldest nat come to shryfte ne grace. ?yt, þyr ys þe þred resun þat hastyly shal þy shryfte be doun; For yn þat tyme þat þy synne ys, Þou art departed fro heuene blys, And fro alle þe felawrede Þat shulde þe helpë at þy nede, And fro þe preyers of holy cherche, And fro alle gode dedes, þat men þer werche; Alle þe prayers, with-outë fayle, To þe blys of heuene, þe mow nat auayle. Algate y rede, þou do gode dede; To ryse fro synne, hyt wyl þe spede, And bettyr wyl hyt pay God almy?t, And þy penaunce shal be þe more ly?t, And, þe more grace shalt þou haue, Þe for to shryue and saue. The þred poynt of shryfte. Þe þryd poynt of þy shryfte, ‘Opunly þyn herte vp lyfte:’ So byt God to me and þe, Þat opunly shal þy shryftë be. Salamon to vs seyþ, and kalleþ, ‘Seuene tymes on a day þe ry?twys man falleþ;’ As oftë þan behoueþ þe ryse, ?yf þou lyue yn ry?t seruyse. Þus seyþ þe clerke seynt Austyne, Þat was a mayster of dyuyne, ‘?yf þou to many prestes atwynne, Al holyche wylt shryue þy synne, Þou shalt fynde grace and for?yuenes, And mede to þe, for þy mekenes.’ Þre þyngës mayst þou fynde, Þat wyl þe oute of synnë bynde; Þe fyrst ys, þat þou mayst lere, And many dyuers samples here, Of euery prest, a lessoun, To knowë þy saluacyoun; ?yf þou haue herde of many a-pryse, þe morë þou canst, of queyntyse. þe touþer me þenkeþ a gode resoun, Þat quyteþ þe fro dampnacyoun, þe ofter þat þou shewest þy blame, þe more me þenkeþ þou hast of shame; þe shame þat þou hast yn þy shewyng, hyt ys for?yuenes, to gode endyng. Þe þred, ys, þat þe weyl weres, For þou shalt be yn alle preyers Of alle þe prestes þat þe haue shryue, As longë tyme as euer þey lyue, For þey are holdë þar-vn-to; þe order of prest wyl hyt be so; þe mo prestës þat for þe prey, þe sunner art þou yn gode wey; And, at þe day of Iugëment, To God þey shul make þy present, þat þou werë clenë shryue, And þat þey mow be þe for?yue. þo þat þou hast here hyd, þurgh alle þe werld þey shul be kyd, And askë domë on þe þere, þat þou, of hem, neuer shryuë were; For allë þyng þat euer ?yt was, Shal þe acoupe of þy trespas; Þe synnë hymself shal forwreye; Þyn Inwyt, on þe self, þe dome shal leye. þe fourþe poynt of shryfte. Þe fourþë poynt, ful feyre hyt ys, ‘yn shryftë to haue mekënes.’ She chese þat vertu, oure lady, So seyþ “magnificat,” here owne storye, ‘Þe gretë mekenes many folde Yn hys hand-mayden, God wlde beholde.’ Syn mekenes ys so noble a ?yfte, For-?ete hyt nat yn ?ourë shryfte. So spekeþ þe gospel of þys vertu, How a mesyl come to Ihesu with gode wyl, and on knees hym sette, And ful myldely, Ihesu he grette; “lorde,” he seyd, “þou mayst me saue ?yf þou wylt, and y hele haue.” Ihesu sagh hys myldënes, And seyd “y wyl hele, alle þy sykenes.” He þat ys yn dedly synne, Gostely he ys a mesyl with-ynne; He þat wyl hys helë seke, To hys prest he mote be meke; ?yf þou meke þe to þy prest, Þou mekës þe to Goddës brest; ?yf þou be to hym ful stour, Þou doust to God grete dysonour; he sytteþ þere, yn Goddys se; To deme þy synne, he haþ pouste; ?yf he blame þe for þyn euyl, þat þou hast serued moche þe deuyl, Defendë nat þy folye, yn pryde ne yn ypocrysye; Noþer on þy self lye þou no?t, To seye þyng þat þou neuer wro?t; Ne forsake nat þy synne to wreye; More and lesse, behoueþ þe seye. þe fyueþe poynt of shryfte. Go we now to þe fyfþe poynt: To þe þrydde hyt ys a ioynt, þere y spake of ofte shryuyng, To tellë many prestes a þyng. what men are þo þat shryue hem bleþly, But þo þat synne but ly?tly? For þo þat haue do synnës grete, Vnneþë wyl þey any lete. ?yf þey here any predycacyoun, Or sum ouþer chaunse be doun, ?yt wyl þey neuer shryue here shame, So are þey bounde yn þe fendës hame. And somë lette, for hard penaunce, For to telle here grete cumberaunce. And somë lette here synne to seye, For doute of prest, þat wyl hem bewreye: No shame my?t to mochë be To þe prest þat telleþ þat pryuyte. letteþ nat, ?oure synne to telle; Þenkeþ on þe peynes of helle; what day þat ?e dyd ?oure synne, And how long ?e haue lyued þer-ynne, what tyme, ánd how, hyt was wro?t; Alle hyt nede þurghout be soghte. Seynt Dauyd, þe holy prophete, Seyþ, þese wurdes, ful swete, “Alle my shryftë and my shame Haþ so couerd and hyd my blame, þat þe fende may haue no sy?t, Me to bewreyë with no ply?t; Ne God of heuene wyl nat se Any þyng þat wyl dampnë me.” ?yf þou shryue þe apertly, Þou mayst be sekyr to haue mercy. The syxte poynt of shryfte. Þe syxte poynt ys, sorowe of herte; Þat oght to be bytter and smerte whan þou þenkest on þe gode dedes, þat, God haþ do for þy nedes, And þou hast do, as þou weyl wost, Þyng, þat, he hateþ moste. No creatures ne hateþ he no?t, But synnë þat ys do or wro?t; Ne he hateþ nat þe fende of helle, Þe crëature of hym y telle, But þe wykkednes, pryde and synne Þat yn hym ys, and wyl nat blynne; Ne was þyr neuer aungel so bry?t, Ne man so weyl with God almy?t, Þat, ?yf he had synned dedly, To hellë pyne he was wurþy; Þat oght þey boþe to sorowe and kare, Þat yn dedly synnë are. God hym self, of mageste, Vnto hys lykenes he formed þe; he made þy soule boþe fayre and clene, And to hys ownë godhede sene; And whan þou synnest, þou turnest wyk, And makest þy soulë black as pyk; Þát God had made to hym so weyl, Þou makest hyt lyke þe fende echedeyl. Sorowe oghte þan, þyn hertë bynde, Þat þou art tó hym so vnkynde; Þou dysonourest hym yn þat outrage, And reuylyst hys feyre ymage. Of þys þyng þan ?yuest þou leste, whan þou cumst laghyng to þe prest; Euyl oghtest þou laghe, coudest þou se How þou bryngest þy dome with þe; Aboute þy nekke, hanggeþ a wyþþe, Þat haþ þe departed fro Goddys gryþþe: Þy self beryst þan, on þy bak, Þy vylë synne þat makeþ þe blak; May nonë fro þat dome þe borowe, But ?yf hyt be with byttyr sorowe. Goddys treytour, and ry?t vyleyn! Hast þou no mynde of Marye Maudeleyn, How she so?t oure lorde Ihesus Yn Symundës hous leprous? Opone þyn herte, þy gostly eres, And þenke on herë byttyr teres! She cam nat laghyng to þe feste, Noþer for game, noþer for geste; She com wepyng with here yne, Of Ihesu to haue medycyne; She bro?t a smel of grete sauour, Þat tokeneþ loue and grete onour; with here terës þat she lete, þarwyþ she wyssh Ihesu fete: So behoueþ vs with here to grete, ?yf we, oure synne, wyl truly lete; And, but we haue sorowe for oure synne, Þe mercy of God mow we nat wynne. þe seuenþe poynt of shryfte. The seuenþe poynt ys a gode resun, ‘Þat þy shryfte be wysly doun,’ Þat ys to sey, to a wys man, Þat þy shryfte vndrystondë kan; Nat to one þat haþ no wyt Of vndyrstondyng of holy wryt. Seynt Austyn seyþ þys skyl, Do þyr-aftyr who so wyl, ‘Of synnë, who so wyl hym lese, A wyse shryftfadyr behoueþ hym chese; And þat may byndë and vnbynde, Swych a man behoueþ hym fynde.” A prest þat ys no clergye ynne, How can he weyl dystyncte þy synne? But now, oueralle, se we mowne An holywatyr clerk of a tounne, þat lytyl haþ lerned yn hys lyue, he ys ordeyned a prest to shryue. ?yf he shulde a shryfadyr be, hym behoueþ haue lerned of sum degre, Or lerned, or herde, of some þat couþe, Ar he had be prest yn hys ?ouþe; And moche behoueþ hym stody and se, Or lerne at sum, yn pryuyte. he may lyue, as a gode man, Þoghe he lytyl clergy kan; But for to preche, or herë shryfte, Of clergy behoueþ hym sum þryfte. And allë prestes haue nat powere For to assoylë þe ry?t clere, But hyt be þy parysshe preste, Or haue hys leuë at þe leste, Or at þy parsone or vycary, For þese haue of þy soule maystry: Aske hem leue, and haue no gylt, And shryuë þe þan, where þou wylt. The ey?tþe poynt of shryfte. The eyghtþe poynt of þe twelue, ‘Þy shryfte shal be alle of þy selue,’ Of þyn ownë proper dede, And bewreye none ouþer, y þe forbede. Þyn ownë foly þou shalt seye, And none ouþer body bewreye. Dauyd seyþ yn þe sautere Þese wurdes, þurgh Goddys powere,— he spekeþ as weyl to lerned as to lewed,— “Myn owne lyfe, lorde, y haue þe shewed; None ouþer mannes y wyl dyscrye, For þat were boþe synne and vyleynye.” ?yue gode tent, to þys poynt, Þou prest þat art a-noynt! ?yf a man telle þe hys synne, And a-noþer be menged þer-ynne,— As ?yf hyt were yn lecherye, Or hylp to sle, or robborye, For þese may nat a man weyl do Alone, but ouþer be þar-vnto,— Aske aftyr none ouþer name, But lestene wyl hys ownë blame; For ?yf þou any ouþer man namest, Y dar weyl seye þou hym dyffamest; hyt ys grete synne to hym and þe To aske or telle þat shulde nat be; hyt ys bakbytyng, and no shryfte; hyt ys a spyce of euyl þryfte.

Do nat as þe pharysu, Preydë God a?ens hys pru; He ?ede to þe cherche with a man Þat men calle a publycan,— A publycan ys, yn oure sawe, A synful man, oute of þe lawe; Þys pharysu ys to mene ‘byfore,’ As forby alle, and fro ouþer shore,— Þys pharysu bygan to prey, And seyd, as a shrewe shulde sey, “Lordë, þanked mote þou be, y am nat, as y ouþer se, Coueytous, ne lecherous of flesshe, And nat as he, þys publycan, ys: Euery woke y fastë twys, And ?yue my tyþes of rychë prys.” Loke how he made hys auauntement Of þat gode þat God hadde hym sent; ?e, syre, on a wykked wyse, Oþer men for tó despyce; hys owne godenes, coude he nat sey, But algate ouþer, behoueþ hym wreye. Besydë stode þe pupblycan, And knew hym self a wykked man, And durst nat loke to God vpward, But knokked on hys brest ful harde, And seyd with herte ful drefully, “Lorde, þou haue on me mercy!” Þe þublycan had mochë þanke; Þe pharysu, byfore God he stanke. Þus seyþ þe gospel, þat we alle knowe, “who so makeþ hym hygh, he shal be lowe; And, who loghyþ hym yn skylle, Gode heghnes he shal come tylle.” Some, whan þey here shryfte bygynne, he shal hepe on God hys synne, And seyþ algate, ‘he ne may no?t kepe hym, but synne be wro?t.’ And some sey, whan þey do euyl, Hyt was algate þurgh þe deuyl; And some sey, as y haue herde, ‘A! syre! so synneþ alle þe werlde.’ Of þy self, shal nat be seyd; On þe, shal alle þe blame be leyd; God blameþ þe for þy mysdede, why seyst þou þan, ‘þe behoueþ nede?’ Ne no fende may but temptë þe; Þe dede shal alle þyn ownë be; Ne at þe worlde mayst þou no?t kest; Do þy self weyl, hyt ys þe best; Here mayst þou se wyþ godë skyl, Alle hyt ys at þyn ownë wyl.

[The Bible-Tale of Ananias and Sapphira.] Seynt Luke seyþ hys autoryte, Yn þe bygynnyng of crystyanyte, Þe apostoles wente aboute to preche— Þe crystyndom for to preche— how men shuld þe worlde forsake, And what mede þarforë take; Ryche men solde here lande and fee, And come to þe apostoles yn pouerte. A ryche man, þat hyghte Ananye, He solde hys godë plenerlye; þe syluer þat he þarfore tolde, þerof a party he ded withholde;— Hys wyfe cunseyled wel þar-to Þat he shulde nat awey alle do;— Þe touþer partë, alle he lete, And keste hyt at seynt Peter fete. Seynt Petyr parceyued anoun þat þyr was þere gylë doun: he seyd, “y comaundë þe, Alle þat þyr was, þou shewe hyt me.” Ananyas þan swore hym þore, he solde hys þyng, for no more. Seynt Peter, þan seyd astyt, “why lyest þou on þe holy spyryt?” þys Ananyas fyl dowun dede, As, blak, as any lede. Men tokë þe body asswyþe, And byryed hyt, þat ychë syþe. hys wyfe come byfore hem alle,— Saphyra, men here calle;— She cunseyled þat hyt was hyd, But she ne wyst what was betyd. Seyn Peter asked here þe soþe ywys, “hast þou no more þan now here ys?” Saphyra answered and seyd, “Y haue no more þan here ys leyd.” “þou lyest,” he seyde, “þe soþe y se, And nat ?yt al onely to me, But þou lyest vnto þe holy goste, þat alle þyng wote, and my?t haþ moste.” Asswyþë, yn a lytyl stounde, She fyl dowun dede vnto þe grounde.

Gode graunte vs þe soþe to sey, And clene be shryuë ar we dey! þe tenþe poynt of shryfte.

[The Tale of how Shrift made a Woman's unconfest Sin fly out of her Mouth as a ‘Blak,’ a ‘Fende of Helle.’] Of a womman y herde onys spelle, þat alle here synnës wulde nat telle; þys wumman hadde do a synful dede; here shamed to telle hyt for drede. On a day, grace was here ?yue, þat she þo?te she wulde be shryue: þys womman come vnto a frere, And, preyd hym, here lyfe to here. As she sat here shryftë ynne, She þo?te vppon þys ychë synne; Þe frerë cumforted here weyl, Boldely to sey euery deyl; hys cumforte madë here ry?t bolde, So þat she furþe þe synnë tolde, þat she haddë longe forhole, þurgh cunseyl of þe deuyl stole; But, at þat ychë breyde þat she furþe þe synnë seyde, Come fleyng oute, at here mouþe a blak, Ry?t as she þe wurdë spak: þe frerë sagh hyt apertly, And þanked God of hys mercy. þat ychë blak, y dar wel telle þat hyt was a fende of helle, þat my?t no lenger yn here reste whan þe synnë oute gan breste; But as longe as she þe synne forhale, Þe deuyl helde ful stylle hys stale; For euer-more he wyl a-byde whyl o synnë may hym hyde; And, for þat yche resun why, Shryue we oure synnë, alle holy; Nat by parcelles, to prestes atwynne; To one, alle holy, shryue þy synne; To o preste telle hyt euery deyl, Þan art þou shryuë holy weyl: At oure shryfte, God ?yue vs my?t Þese poyntes to kunne, and shewe hem ry?t. Now haue ?e herde þe poyntës twelue, how euery man shal shryue hym selue, And of þese poyntes lerned sum deyl, how ?e mow[ë] shryue ?ow weyl. Prestës oghte hem alle to kunne, lewed men to teche and monne; And but þey techë hem þys lore, Here perel ys weyl þe more. Moche ys shryftë for to preyse; Þe dede, to lyue, he may vpreyse; A soulë þat ys dede þurgh synne, Þurgh shryftë comþ gracë þer-ynne. Many godenesse my?t men telle, How shryfte confoundeþ þe deuyl of helle. Lesteneþ, godë men, to lere, Þe grace of shryftë ?e mow here. The fyrste grace þat shryfte ?yueþ. þe fyrst grace þat þy shryfte shal ?yue, he makeþ þy soulë for to lyue. whan þy mouþe with shryfte ys opun, Deþ and synne are boþe oute lopun. Salamon seyþ, þat ys wys, Yn a bokë of Prouerbyys, “Þe weye of lyue, with-outyn ende, Oute of ry?twys mannes mouþe shal wende.” Of þe mouþe þat ys vnry?t, hyd hys synne fro grace and ly?t; Þy mouþë no gracë cumþ ynne, whan þyn herte ys ded yn synne: Deþ and lyfe, ?e mowe weyl se, To-gedyr mow þey neuer be. For somë, whan þey come to shryfte, No more wyl þey here herte vp lyfte To God for grace, but beþ harde as stone, So longe haue þey with here synne gone; Sorowe of synnë haue þey no?t, So ys here soule beneþë bro?t. For, a lymme þat ys ded or drye Þurgh sykenes, or smete yn pallësye, Þogh men prykkë hyt wyþ oghte, For hyt ys dede, hyt feleþ no?te; No more of grace, þe soule may fonge, Þat haþ ley yn synne so longe; But Ihesu cryst, þat none wyl tyne, he boghte alle mankynde wyþ pyne, And graunteþ hym grace, hys shryfte bygynne, And yn hys shryfte, to sorowe hys synne.

Þan ys þys a feyrë ?yfte, Þe lyfe of euer, þurg þy shryfte; Þy soule þat was for synnë lore, Þurgh shryfte haþ grace and lyfe byfore; Þys ys þe grace and þe fyrst vertu, Þat shryfte doþ to þy soulë pru. þe secunde grace þat shryfte ?yueþ. A-noþer ?yfte he ?yueþ large; hyt aleggeþ þe of heuy charge; For euery synne, as hyt amounteþ, Shalt þou haue, whan deþ acounteþ; But yn euery tyme þat þou shryuest þe, Of pyne shalt þou vncharged be; For, þe prest haþ powere To asoyle þe quyte and clere. ?yf þou for synne mayst haue sorowe, Fro heuy pyne hyt wyl þe borowe; Body and soule moche ys a-legged, whan of synne þou art a-bregged; kyndly, ys þat man heuy Loke what Iope seyþ, þat was of suffraunce; Þat haþ synned wykkedly. He spekeþ to God for swyche a chaunce, “Lorde,” he seyþ, “weyl y hyt se, My synne ys allë á?ens me; For, whan y þenke on my synne, Ful of angwys y am with-ynne; For heuy byrdon, þat y of hem bere, Y am confounded, my self to were.” And y haue oftë herd men seye, And y wote my self þe certeyn wey, Þat, when men haue synned dedly, Here soule ys mornyng and heuy, And cumbred ful of þo?t and drede, Ne he haþ no wyl to do gode dede; But whan þey haue be clenë shryue And do þe penaunce þat was hem ?yue, Hem þo?t hem self wundyr ly?t, And, lesse dremed on þe ny?t. Yn alle þys worlde [n]ys so heuy þyng, As yn synne to haue dwellyng; Þe synne God hateþ, þat on hem hangeþ; And Goddës hatred, helle hyt fangeþ; Þan ys wundyr, þat þe erþe hym bereþ, But onely þat Goddys mercy hym wereþ, And wyl [nat] þat he were cumbred or shent, But a-bydeth hys amendëment; So ys þe ?yfte of shryftë large, And leseþ men of heuy charge; Y rede we loue hyt, at alle our my?t, For body and soule, hyt makeþ ly?t. The þred grace þat shryfte ?yueþ. þe þred grace of hys ?euyng ys, as hyt were, anoyntyng: Anoyntyng ys gode for body sore, And shryfte ys a-noyntyng for euermore; For, shryfte ys a sacrament, hyt ys a grace, to alle men lent; And, who-so cumþ weyl þar-tyl, Fourë þynges he haþ þurgh skyl;— Þe fyrst þyng þou shalt beleue ynne, To haue for?yuenes for þy synne, ?yf þat þou truly þe shryue, And weyl holde hyt yn þy lyue. Mekenes ys þe touþer, men telle, And yn godë hope to dwelle, Þat þe shryfte, þat we to go, Alle oure synne may quenche and slo. Þe þred ys, þat he shal fonde To brynge hym oute of þe fendës bonde; For þus hyt seyþ, weyl y wote, yn a boke þat seynt Austyn wrote: ‘Yn wey to heuene, may no man be, But he haue wyl, hys bande to fle.’ Þe fourþë þyng þat shal be dy?t, Alle hole þy wyl, to God almy?t, Hym to wurschepe ouer alle, Þat he wulde to shryfte þe calle, And brynge þe á?en to hys grace Þat þou lostest with þy wanlace. whan þou art ?olde to be hys seruaunt, Fals hym nat, but holde hym cunnaunt; Hyt ys alle hys, þat þou lyuest by, Serue nat þan hys en[e]my! The fourþe grace þat shryfte ?yueþ. Þe fourþë grace ys weyl to telle, how shryfte shendeþ þe fende of helle. ?y[f] þou wylt make þe deuyl shent, And with-stonde hys tycëment, with no þyng mayst þou do hym so wo As louë ofte to shryftë go; Þan ys he a-shamed to tempte þe, For þat þou bewreyyst hys pryuyte: Þys seyþ Salamon þe kyng, ‘?yf þou shewe þy frende a þyng, And he þat pryuyte bewreye, Þe loue betwenë ?ow shal deye.’ Sykyr þou be, certeynly, Þe fende þe fleþ ful hastyly: whan þou shryuest þe for hys shame, Þat ys shenshepe vnto hys name; Hym shameþ þat he ys ouercome, For þan ys moche of hys my?t ouernome, And euermore he ys þe more coward For to tempte þe aftyrward. Syn þat God haþ swyche grace lent Þurgh oure shryfte to make hym shent, Fonde we þan, and leuë no?t, Þat he were to shamë bro?t; Certys we shuld haue gode wyl To shendë hym þat wulde vs spyl. Anouþer cumfort ys wel to mene, þat shent þe fende, and doþe hym tene: ?yf he ys aboute to temptë þe To any synne, what so hyt be, ?yf þou with-stonde þe temptacyoun, And parceyuest what he wld haue doun, Þan halt he hym shamly dysceyued, Þat of hys queyntyse þou art parceyued; Ne he shal neuer efte haue þat powere, Of þat synne to tempte þe nere; For þy wyþstondyng haþ hym rafte, Of hys temptyng, alle þe crafte. Blessed ys shryfte with God almy?t, For hyt confoundeþ þe deuyl doun ry?t; God ?yue vs grace, þe fende to shende, And vn-to shryfte oure wyl alle wende. The fyfueþ grace þat shryfte ?yueþ. ?yt þyr ys a feyrë ?yfte Þat vs purcháceþ þe grace of shryfte; hyt makeþ vs lefe, þere we were loþe, hyt peseþ God whan he ys wroþe. wroþë shul we neuer hym make, But hyt were for synnë sake; ?yue þou þe shryue, and mercy cry, God for?yueþ all þy foly. weyl o?t we loue hym as lorde and syre, Þat wyl so sone for?yue hys yre; Þarfore seyþ seynt Bernard, Þat noun, to shryfte, be slogh ne hard. Haue þou mekenes with répentaunce, And hope yn shryfte gode áffyaunce, How þou hast my?t merueylusly Ouer God, and hyse þat are hym by, And ouercomest hym gracyously, Þat noun may wynnë with maystry; For allë þyng, for drede hym douteþ, And to hys domë, alle þyng louteþ. Shryfte, þou art of grete vertu, And purchacest to vs grete pru; For whan þou comst byfore þe kyng, Forgyuënes ys þyn askyng; And þat yche kyng loueþ þe so wel, Þat he for?yueþ þe euery deyl. Shryfte, þou art Goddes messangere; Þou makyst synful, aungelys pere; Þou purchasest vs, pes and gryþ; So seyþ to vs þe prophete Dauyd: whan he was yn synnë shent, And dampnable yn Iugëment, A wurde he seyde to þe prophete, “Y haue synned; y wyl of lete.” Natan þe prophete for?aue hys synne whan he seyd þat he wulde blynne. Þe glose here-on seyþ redyly, ‘he þat shryueþ hym parfytely, Asswyþë, for þat shryfte, He haþ for?yuenes, of Goddys ?yfte.’ He þat þenkeþ for to be shryue, And hope hyt ys to be for?yue, ?yf hyt so be þat he with-drawe Hys mys-dede, for Goddys awe, Þan may y, ful weyl proue Þat þe prophete Dauyd seyde aboue: Þus he seyd yn hys lyue, “Y haue þo?të me to shryue, And God for?auë me, as sone, Alle þe synnes þat y haue done.” Yn þe byble men fynde þese þynges, Yn a boke þat ys of kynges. The syxte grace þat shryfte ?yueþ. The syxtë grace of shryfte to neuene, Hyt ioyeþ alle þe court of heuene. whan þou þe mekest to make þy shryfte, Þe aungelys of heuene þou ?yuest a ?yfte; A swetnes of ioye ys hem among, Þat ys confermed with gospel song; ‘Yn heuene, ys more ioye auenaunt, Of a synful man repentaunt, Þan of nynty aungelys and nyne Þat neuer synned, ne were wurþy pyne;’ Þys ys Goddys ownë wurde, And redde yn chyrchë at hys borde. whan þou repentest with þy gode wyl, And clene art shryue of alle þyn yl, Þe aungelys make for þe a þankyng, Þat þou fulfyllest here grete longyng; Longyng, ful ofte þe aungelys make, what tyme we wyl oure synnes forsake, Þat we were redy to haue þat blys That for vs ordeyned ys; For þurgh þe manhede of Ihesus, Ys here ioye fulfylled yn vs. Þan ys hyt on þe touþer party whan we synnë dedly; we lese þe ioye þat þey are ynne, For long lyggyng yn oure synne. Y trowe euery man þat had þys þo?t, wulde ful sone of synne be bro?t, Þogh hyt were for noun þer þyng, But for þe aungelys grete longyng; Shryue we vs þan, most and leste, And make þe aungelys a feyre feste. Shryftë ys þe ?ate of heuene, Hyt ys a wey þat ledeþ vs euene; And at þe entre, ys none forsake Þat ys weyl shryue, and haþ penaunce take; And, þo þat vnshryuë be, þere þey getë none entre. Allas, þat oure synne ys so grefe, Þat leseþ þe ioye þat we are lefe! God graunte vs alle swych shryfte to take, Þat we, þe aungeles, ioye mow make! The seuenþe grace þat shryfte ?yueþ. The seuenþe ys, and þat weyl endyþ, ‘Þat oure shryfte, þe deuyl blyndeþ.’ whan he made vs falle yn plyght, He refte vs allë gostely sy?t; Fro synne to synne he made vs falle, And oure fadres byfore vs alle. Y rede we ?elde hym þe countre paye, And blyndë we hym fro hys praye. we put oute hys y?e gostly whan we shryue vs opunly; Certes he may nat knowe vs efte, For oure shryfte haþ hym þe sy?t refte. þat may weyl y-shewed be with a tale of an autoryte. [A Tale of How to put the Devil's Eye out spiritually, or How by Shrift a Man made himself invisible to the Fiend who before used to lead him about chaind.] Þyr was onys an ermyte, Þat was euer yn Gode parfyte; So moche he hadde of Goddys grace, Þat he coude knowe, yn euery place, whych men were yn dedly synne, And who was godë lyfe with-ynne; And also, he my?t se weyl Þyng þat was spyrytuele. An halyday fyl, as ys þe acyse, Men to go to Goddys seruyse; Þys erymyte lened hym on a walle, And badde hys bedys, and loked ouer-alle, And beheld þe folke þat come yn þe gate, whyche come erlye, and whyche late, whyche come with gode deuocyoun, And whyche for ouþer enchesoun: Alle sagh þys ermyte euerydeyl, who come wrong, and who come weyl. As he stode, he toke gode hede, How a deuyl, a man gan lede; with hym he com alle weyl þe gate, And ledde hym to þe chyrchë ?ate, And yn to þe cherchë?erde; Forþer durst he nat, for ferde. And whan he yn-to þe cherch shuld go, Þan brast þe fendës chayn yn two; Þe fende stode stylle, and loked a-boute, And a-bode þys man wyþ-oute; On hys clawys he helde þys cheyne, And loked what tyme he come a?eyne. þe holy man ?aue godë tent whyder þat ychë man was went. þat ychë man, þat was yn synne, And haddë longë leye þer-ynne; Þurgh grace óf þe holy spyryt, he ?ede and shrouë hym astyt, And þo?t neuer to turne a?eyn, But sorowed þat hé þer-ynne had leyn. whan þat þys man shryuë was, And was passed þat synful pas, As þys man come outë þere, Þe fende loked aboute euery-where, And coude nat fynde hym, for no nede, Among þe ouþer, þere þey ?ede; Þe sy?të of hym hadde he lore, Al þogh he ?ede next hym byfore. Long loked þat foulë wyght, And coude nat se hym with no sy?t; He stode stylle tyl alle men were goun, But sy?të of hym hadde he noun. Þys holy ermyte to hym ?ede: “Treytur,” he seyd, “for what nede Stanst þou here; telle hyt me, Yn Goddys name, y cóniure þe.” Þan answered þat glotoun, “y abyde here my prysoun, Þat long haþ be vndyr my hande, And haue led hym aboute with þys bande; Langer wente he yn fro me, He come nat oute ?yt, þat y coude se; Among many, y haue hym so?te; Me þenkeþ wundyr, y fynde hym no?te.” Þys ermyte hyed fast and ran, And ouertoke þys ychë man, And, preyd hym a stounde to dwelle, And of hys lyfe, sumwhat to telle: “Y graunte,” he seyd, “to þe to seye. To þe cherche, as y wente my weye y felte me charged yn a synne,— And, long had y leye þere-ynne,— y þo?te y wulde me þer-of shryue, And amende þe trespas yn my lyue. At þe cherche, y shroue me weyl, Plenerly of euery deyl; Blessed be now God almy?t, Me þynkeþ y am wundyrly ly?t.” Þan þo?te þe Ermyte astyte, þat whan men haue yn synne delyte, Þan haþ þe fendë enchesoun To byndë hym as a presun; And whan he haþ wyl, hym to shryue, Hys bandys brest, and al to-ryue; And, whan he ys clenë shryuyn, Þe deuyl knoweþ hym no more syþen. Þe holy man come þan to þe deuyl, And bad he shulde do no man euyl, But go to helle, þere he come fro, Euer to dwelle yn pyne and wo. Þarfore, y rede þat we bygynne To shryuë vs of alle our synne. The eyghte grace þat shryfte ?yueþ. Newë þy shryftë euer ylyke, hyt makeþ Iesu cryst to þe meke. ?yt þyr ys a properte, Þat euer ylyke þy shryfte shal be; As ofte as þou yn synne doust falle, As oftë rys vp fro hem alle, Nat, wyþ no feyntyse, with verry shryftë shalt þou ryse. Baptem, fro Adams synne vs drewe, But shryfte clenseþ vs euery day newe; we synful mow þarfore be bolde; To vs ys shryfte a blysful holde; As ofte as þou to shryfte art went, As ofte helpeþ þe, þe sacrament: Here-of spekeþ Isayë A wurde yn hys prophesye, “whan man haþ fylled hys soule with ylle Þurgh hys ownë wykked wylle, y rede hym þat he oftë synge wurschyp vn-to oure heuene kynge.” Þys song to mene, yn my resoun, Ys trewë shryfte, and oftë doun. Þyr ys no þyng þat man may neuene, Þat more stereþ God of heuene, Of vs synful to haue mercy, Þan doþ shryfte, þere hyt ys do trewly. who so syngeþ to God with shryfte, For hys song he ?yueþ hym a ?yfte; Hys ?yfte ys ioye with-outyn wo, Þat þe fendë was kast fro. On many maner my?t men proue How shryfte ys gode to oure byhoue; But longe hyt werë for to dwelle, Þe propertees, alle for to telle, But touche y wyl, two or þre, Þat ?e mow weyl warned be. That þou falle nat yn wanhope. Haue no wanhope, for no maner of kas; Be nat lyke Kaym ne Iudas. Þe werst þarfore, y wylle fyrst grope, Þat man kalle ‘wanhope:’ Al tymes ys God more wroþer with þys Þan with any oþer þyng þat ys; Þyr ys no synne þat men of rede, Só moche withseyþ þe godhede; For wanhope wenyþ þat þe foly Be more þan Goddës mercy; And ?yf þou wene þat synne be more, Þou wenest þat þe godhede, so moche ne wore, Ne had so mochë my?t hym ynne, Þat hyt my?t fór?yue alle þy synne. Se how wanhope, man wyl shende A?ens þe godhede with-outyn ende! Hyt ys no wundyr, þogh he be wroþe; Hyt a?enseyþ hys my?t &amp; hys mercy boþe. Swych shryfte madë wreched Kaym, whan he hadde hys broþer slayn; ‘Of God,’ he seyd, ‘he was nat wurþy, For hys grete synne, to haue mercy.’ For hys wanhope, þat foule glotoun, God ?aue hym hys malysun; And alle þo, þat trowe synne may be Morë þan Goddës pyte. And swych shryftë, made Iudas; He shrouë hym of hys trespas, He hadde grete sorowe and contrycyun Þat he ded hys lorde tresun; Þer-of he repented hym so gretly, he ?ede and hyng hym self ful hy; He shroue hym with grete répentaunce, But of Goddys mercy he hadde none affyaunce. Here mowe ?e se, þat shryfte and sorowe Alle only may no man borowe, But he haue gode hope, whan he ys shryue, Þat hys synne shal be for?yue: Þys shal ?e beleue, with-outë nay, Þat, God wyl for?yue, and may. An holy man þys samë spelleþ Þat of Iudas wanhope telleþ, ‘For hys wanhope, God wroþer was, Þan for hys tresun or ouþer trespas; Hys wanhope toke he more to grefe, Þan hys takyng, as a þefe.’ Ihesu, ful of mercy mylde, Fro wanhope vs allë shylde, And graunte vs alle swych hope &amp; stedfast trouþe þat þy mercy on vs haue rouþe! That þou excuse nat þy synne. ?yt þer ys an vnþryfte Þat doþ moche skaþe yn shryfte; Þat þou defendest þe fro ply?t, And puttest þy synne on God almy?t. So dyd oure fadyr Adam, whan God of heuene to hym cam, And seyd, “Adam, why art þou yn synne?” “lorde,” he seyd, “my wyfe made me bygynne; Þat ychë wyfe þat þou me wro?t, She synned fyrst, and y no?t.” Seeþ how Adam bygan to lye, And put on God hys owne folye! For, God forbede þat tre, Þat he ne shulde ete þer-of, ne she: Seeþ how he ded, þat God forbede, And dyd aftyr hys wyuës rede; He wulde haue excused hys fame, As who seyþ ‘God was to blame;’ Þese lewed men sey, and erre ful ylle, And seye ‘hyt was alle Goddys wylle.’ ?yf þat hyt Goddys wyl shulde be, why forbede he hym þat tre? Hyt may nat be, for no nede, Þat God wulde be do, he shulde forbede; Syn he forbed, hyt shulde be no?t, A?ens hys byddyng, Adam hyt wro?t; Þan hyt semeþ, hyt was but suffraunce, Nat hys wyl, nat hys ordynaunce, But lete hym haue alle hys fre wyl, Hym self for to saue or spyl. Nay, nay! Adam, alle mys ?ede, On God to put alle hys mysdede, As who seyþ ‘he shulde nat be shent, But Eue brak þe commaundëment, For she ?aue hym þe appul here lete, And God was gylty þat he hyt ete.’ He my?t a fórsake, and seyd nay, But whan he toke hyt, he brake þe lay. ?yf a man me now forbede þyng þat y ne shulde haue of dede, y were to blame ?yf y hyt toke; Bettyr were fyrst þat y hyt forsoke; So my?t Adam haue hyt forsake, For God for-bede þat none shuld be take. Syn he dyd þus a?ens hys forbode, Ho dar sey hyt was þe wyl of God? ?yt þyr are many þat þus seye, Þat alle here wyte on God wul leye, And tellë men þus apertly Þey mow nat holdë fro foly, And sey þey mowe nat lyuë chaste, But nedly hym behoueþ do waste. Y seye, as þe holy man seys, He lyeþ apertely on alle weys; For ?yf þat he wulde do now folye wyþ a womman yn lecherye, And ?yf a-noþer, hyt my?t se, At þat tyme he wulde late be; He ne letteþ for Goddes comaundement, But for hym þat þere ys present. Alle þo þat sey ‘hem byhoueþ nedely,’ Þey acoupe God of here folye. why shulde he þat þyng forbede, Þat nedely moste be do yn dede? hyt were foly, comaunde a þyng Þat my?t nat ?yue no warantyng. yn twey þynges, wykkedly þey sey, Þat on God here blame alle leye; Lyers algate þey are strong; A-noþer, þey hepe on God here wrong; wykkedly þey synne on þese maners, Þey make hym wers þan ben here peres. That þou make nat þy synne lytyl to seme. Make nat þy synne, lytyl to seme; Telle smale and grete, ?yf þou God queme. ?yt þer ys an enchesun ys kalled ‘dymynucyun’: On englys, hyt ys to mene, To make þy synne lytyl to seme; Hyt ys to mene also anoþer þyng, Of þy synne to make shedyng; And þys may be on two manere, whan hyt shuld be hole and clere:— whan þou tellest but þe grete, þe smalë synnes þan wylt þou lete; þese clerkys kalle hem ‘cyrcumstauncys,’ To þe grete synnes are þey puruyaunces; þou puruéyst fyrst, yn þy þo?t How þe grete synnes shulde be wro?t; Oftyn tyme, a foule þo?t and an yl, wyþ lykyng þer-yn, gadereþ a wyl Aftyr þat wyl, cumþ a sy?t; Aftyr a syghte, a speche ful ry?t; weytyng yn wey, and þarto ?yftes; Alle þese, to þe dede a man lyftes; Alle þese kalle men ‘cyrcumstaunces,’ Þat vn-to þe grete dede men haunces. Lo here ensample of oure tale; Þou sëest stykkës þat are smale, Þey brenne fyrst, feyre and shyre, To brynge þe grete stokkes sone on fyre: Ry?t so do þése smale, þe with-ynne, A gretë synnë to bygynne; Þarfore y warne þe, yn þy lyfe, Of swychë smale þat þou þe shryue; For ?yf þou for-hele hem with þy wyl, So mayst þou þy soulë spyl. Ry?t so fareþ forholen synne, As fyre, borë bosum ynne; At þe lastë, hyt hym dereþ, And brennyþ þat hym aboutë bereþ; For no synne may be hyd, Þat hyt ne behoueþ opunly be kyd; ?yf hyt be shewed here apert, Yn ouþer stede hyt ys couert; And ?yf þou hydë here þy blame, hyt shal be shewed to þy shame. Seynt Austyn seyþ a wurde to charge, Of Goddys ?yfte, how hyt ys large: “Shryueþ ?oure dedës and ?oure þo?t, For God for?yueþ alle or no?t; Oþer for?yueþ he alle with gladehede, Or alle abydeþ to hys wraþhede. ?yf þou be allë fully shryue, Forsoþe þan be þey all for?yue; ?yf þou þe shryue of alle but one, Noþer he for?yueþ þat, ne none.” Yn ry?t resun þese clerkys telle, yn þat stede þere God shal dwelle Plenerly, hyt behoueþ be clene, Þat no synnë mowe be sene. whan synne ys shryue, and clene eche deyl Þere wyl God, holde hys hostele; Þe mantel of loue ys leyd ful euene, Þat heleþ Ihesu and kyng of heuene. Yn o stede ne mowe þey reste; God or þe fendë, outë keste; One of þese, behoueþ þe chese; Take þe toon, þe touþer þou lese. Y wulde holde hym more þan wode, Þat cheseþ þe wykked, and leueþ þe gode. Take we God on oure party, And fle we þe fendës cumpany. That þou make no skornyng yn shryfte. Skorne nat, and seye þou wylt forsake Þy synne, and eft a?en hyt take. ?yt wyl y warne þe of o þyng, Yn shryftë make þou no skornyng. Lytyl mayst þou spede þat whyle, ?yf þou shryuë þe with gyle; For ?yf þou make þy shryftë feynt, Sykyr þou be, þou shalt be a-teynt, whan [þat] þou art nat yn wyl Þe to wyþdrawë fro þyn yl. what doust þou byfore þe prest, And, hast déseyt yn þy brest? Asoyled mayst þou neuer be, But þou wylt þy synnë fle. with skornë wenest þou þe quyte As a fals ypocryte, Þat þou holdest nat cunnaunt, þat þou hetest and takest an hand. A lytyl tale y wyl ?ow telle, How he was shryue, þe fende of helle. [The Tale of how the Devil came to be Shriven.] An holy man, þat God was dere, Onës sat, shryftë to here; To hym come þe fende of helle, Yn form of a man, hys synne to telle;— Þe holy man wende hyt had be A man yn flessh as he dyd se; On hys knees he sett hym downe, with þe prest, for to roune, And tolde hys wykkednes ful bostely. Þe gode man lestned, þat satte hym by; He seyde, “y haue be yn þe se; Þere þre þousend shyppes were dreynt þurgh me; “And alle þe folk with-outë numbre, Allë bro?t y hem to kumbre; Aboue, yn-to þe wynde y wente, And bro?t hem alle to þat turment; On land y haue do more tresun wyþ fyre and slaghtyr yn euery toune, And alle þe skaþe y my?t of mone, Tó hem þat yn borwës wone; y haue made wraþþe and euyl wyl Betwyxë hem þat wulde none yl, And sle echoun ouþer at here my?t, More with wrong, þan with ry?t. “Yn pryde, yn Ire, yn enuye, yn slouþë, and yn coueytyse, yn glotonye, and yn lecherye, Y delyte me yn euery vyleynye; Foule flessh dedes þat are ouer rank, More þan ouþer y take to þank; But, pryde algate, and coueytyse, Y may nat leue, ne none of þyse; Ten þousend men dampned be Yn þese two, for loue of me; when y fynde hem custummably Yn þese two synnës alle redy, Ful weyl payeþ me þat synne, And bounde are þey to me þer-ynne; Þan do þey, ry?t as y wyl, Allë wrong wyþ-outë skylle; Fro wykked to wers, y do hem falle, For y am mayster ouer hem alle; ?yf þey wulde wake, y do hem slepe, And yn ydulnes to lepe; For whan þey are yn beddë bro?t, y do hem synne yn ydul þo?t; yn þo?t of folye, and foule delyte, “I do hem þenkë þan ful tyte. “Certes y may nat telle hyt alle, þe synne þat y haue do, and more shal. Cryst, loue y neuer a deyl, Ne none þat on hym byleueþ weyl, For, yn euery dedly synne y am bounde, and may nat blynne. “Y dyd neuer commaundement þat God vn-to þe folk haþ sent. Þe sacramentys of holy cherche, y loued hem neuer, ne neuer wulde werche. Pryue synne and sacrylage, Þat loue y moste, and rycolage. holy cherche, despyse and fyle, þat wyl y bleþly, alle my whyle.”tyme þe holy man, lestnë bygan, And, had wundyr of þat o man Þat he my?t so moche synnë do, As he a-couped hym self vn-to: Þe godë man, for alle þys chaunce, Sagh yn hym no répentaunce, Ne no sorowe made of contrycyun For no synne þat he had doun. He seyd, “hast þou any shame of þy synne Þat þou hást be so moche ynne?” Þe fende answered to hym a?en: “Wytë þou weyl for certeyn, Þere y dyd but one or two, Y wulde haue do twenty and mo.” “Þan art þou,” he seyd, “a wykked deuyl, Þat þou repentest þe of none euyl.” “?e, certeys,” he seyd, “so y am, A fende of helle, to þe y cam.” “Y coniure þe þat þou me telle— Syn þou art a fende of helle— For what maner þyng a lyue, “Þat þou come hedyr, þe to shryue?” “Now behoueþ me nedely Telle þe euerydel, and why. “Y se men come to shryfte so þykke,— Of some, here soules as blak as pykke, And as grymly on to se As any fende yn helle may be,— Þo samë men, when þey are shryue, So moche bry?tnes ys hem ?yue, Þat no sonnë ys so bry?t As here soules yn Goddys sy?t. Y wyst my self hydus and blak, And no þyng haþ so mochë lak; Þurgh my shryfte, y wende to spede, To haue turned so bry?t as ouþer ?ede.” “Þou art dyceyued, foule treytoure! Þy shryfte may haue no swyche onour; Hyt may neuer do þe pru, Þe feyrehede of shryfte, ne þe vertu. Þo þat þou sawe so blak with-ynne, Þey are repentaunt of here synne, And are now come to ry?t gode wyl, To do penaunce, and no more yl; And þurgh þe shryfte þat þey haue take, Þey are asoyled, and synne forsake. Þere-of cumþ alle here beute Yn here soules, as þou mayst se; But þou þat hast no répentaunce, But loue and lykyng yn cumbraunce, To feyrehede shalt þou neuer wende, But blak and foule wyþ-outyn ende; A deuyl þou come; to Satan þou go! To þat sorowe þat þou come fro.” he wente a-wey, alle for-lore, A deuyl, as he was byfore. Þarfore, gode men, wyte ?e weyl, Shryfte saueþ nat a-lone eche dyl, But ?e haue gode répentaunce, And of fory?uenes gode affyaunce, And yn gode wyl, ?ow to withholde Fro þe synnes þat byfore are tolde. God graunte vs grace, swyche shryfte to make, And for oure synne swyche penaunce take, Þat we be neuer more a-teynt For fals shryuyng, ne for feynt; But graunte vs alle vs self to ?eme, And yn oure shryfte Ihesu to queme! Amen! Here endyþ Manuel Pecché.</field>
