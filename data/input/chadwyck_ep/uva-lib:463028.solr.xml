Heirefter followis the quair Maid be King Iames of scotland the first callit the kingis quair and Maid quhen his Maiestie Wes In Ingland. 1 Heigh In the hevynnis figure circulere The rody sterres twynklyng as the fyre; And, In Aquary, Citherea the clere Rynsid hir tressis like the goldin wyre, That late tofore, In fair and fresche atyre, Through capricorn heved hir hornis bright, North northward approchit the myd-nyght; 2 Quhen as I lay In bed allone waking, New partit out of slepe a lyte tofore, Fell me to mynd of many diuerse thing, Off this and that; can I noght say quharfore, Bot slepe for craft in erth myght I no more; For quhich as tho coude I no better wyle, Bot toke a boke to rede apon a quhile: 3 Off quhich the name Is clepit properly Boece, eftere him that was the compiloure, Schewing [the] counsele of philosophye, Compilit by that noble senatoure Off rome, quhilom that was the warldis floure, And from estatë by fortune a quhile Foriugit was to pouert in exile: 4 And there to here this worthy lord and clerk, His metir suete, full of moralitee; His flourit pen so fair he set a-werk, Discryving first of his prosperitee, And out of that his infelicitee; And than how he, in his poetly report, In philosophy can him to confort. 5 For quhich thoght I in purpose, at my boke, To borowe a slepe at thilkë tyme began; Or euer I stent, my best was more to loke Vpon the writing of this noble man, That in him-self the full recouer wan Off his Infortune, pouert, and distresse, And in tham set his verray sekernesse. 6 And so the vertew of his ?outh before Was in his age the ground of his delytis: Fortune the bak him turnyt, and therfore He makith Ioye and confort, that he quit is Off theire vnsekir warldis appetitis; And so aworth he takith his penance, And of his vertew maid It suffisance: 7 With mony a noble resoun, as him likit, Enditing In his fairë latyne tong, So full of fruyte, and rethorikly pykit, Quhich to declare my scole is ouer ?ong; Therefore I lat him pas, and, in my tong, Procede I will agayn to my sentence Off my mater, and leue all Incidence. 8 The long[ë] nyght beholding, as I saide, Myn eyën gan to smert for studying; My buke I schet, and at my hede It laide; And doun I lay bot ony tarying, This matere new[ë] In my mynd rolling; This Is to seynë, how that eche estate, As fortune lykith, thame will [oft] translate. 9 For sothe It is, that, on hir tolter quhele, Euery wight cleuerith In his stage, And failyng foting oft, quhen hir lest rele, Sum vp, sum doun, Is non estate nor age Ensured, more the pryncë than the page: So vncouthly hir werdes sche deuidith, Namly In ?outh, that seildin ought prouidith. 10 Among thir thoughtis rolling to and fro, Fell me to mynd of my fortune and vre; In tender ?outh how sche was first my fo, And eft my frende, and how I gat recure Off my distresse, and all myn auenture I gan oure-hayle, that langer slepe ne rest Ne myght I nat, so were my wittis wrest. 11 For-wakit and for-walowit, thus musing, Wery, forlyin, I lestnyt sodaynlye, And sone I herd the bell to matyns ryng, And vp I rase, no langer wald I lye: Bot now, how trowe ?e? suich a fantasye Fell me to mynd, that ay me thoght the bell Said to me, “tell on, man, quhat the befell.” 12 Thoght I tho to my-self, “quhat may this be? This is myn awin ymagynacioun; It is no lyf that spekis vnto me; It is a bell, or that impressioun Off my thoght causith this Illusioun, That dooth me think so nycely in this wise;” And so befell as I schall ?ou deuise. 13 Determyt furth therewith In myn entent, Sen I thus haue ymagynit of this soun, And in my tyme more Ink and paper spent To lyte effect, I tuke conclusioun Sum new[ë] thing to write; I set me doun, And furth-with-all my pen In hand I tuke, And maid a ?, and thus begouth my buke. 14 Thou [sely] ?outh, of nature Indegest, Vnrypit fruyte with windis variable; Like to the bird that fed is on the nest, And can noght flee; of wit wayke and vnstable, To fortune both and to Infortune hable; Wist thou thy payne to cum and thy trauaille, For sorow and drede wele myght thou wepe and waille. 15 Thus stant thy confort In vnsekernesse, And wantis It that suld the reule and gye: Ryght as the schip that sailith sterëles Vpon the rok[kis] most to harmes hye, For lak of It that suld bene hir supplye; So standis thou here In this warldis rage, And wantis that suld gyde all thy viage. 16 I mene this by my-self, as In partye; Though nature gave me suffisance In ?outh, The rypenesse of resoun [?it] lak[it] I, To gouerne with my will; so lyte I couth, Quhen sterëles to trauaile I begouth, Amang the wawis of this warld to driue; And how the case, anon I will discriue. 17 With doutfull hert, amang the rokkis blake, My feble bote full fast to stere and rowe, Helples allone, the wynter nyght I wake, To wayte the wynd that furthward suld me throwe. O empti saile! quhare is the wynd suld blowe Me to the port, quhar gynneth all my game? Help, Calyope, and wynd, in Marye name! 18 The rokkis clepe I the prolixitee Off doubilnesse that doith my wittis pall: The lak of wynd is the deficultee In enditing of this lytill trety small: The bote I clepe the mater hole of all: My wit vnto the saile that now I wynd, To seke connyng, though I bot lytill fynd. 19 At my begynnyng first I clepe and call To ?ow, Cleo, and to ?ow, polymye, With Thesiphone, goddis and sistris all, In nowmer ix., as bokis specifye; In this processe my wilsum wittis gye; And with ?our bryght lanternis wele conuoye My pen, to write my turment and my Ioye! 20 In vere, that full of vertu is and gude, Quhen nature first begynneth hir enprise, That quhilum was be cruell frost and flude And schouris scharp opprest In many wyse, And Synthius [be]gynneth to aryse Heigh in the est, a morow soft and suete, Vpward his course to driue In ariete: 21 Passit mydday bot fourë greis evin, Off lenth and brede his angel wingis bryght He spred vpon the ground doun fro the hevin; That, for gladnesse and confort of the sight, And with the tiklyng of his hete and light, The tender flouris opnyt thame and sprad; And, in thaire nature, thankit him for glad. 22 Noght fer passit the state of Innocence, Bot nere about the nowmer of ?eris thre, Were It causit throu hevinly Influence Off goddis will, or othir casualtee, Can I noght say; bot out of my contree, By thaire avise that had of me the cure, Be see to pas, tuke I myn auenture. 23 Puruait of all that was vs necessarye, With wynd at will, vp airly by the morowe, Streight vnto schip, no longere wold we tarye, The way we tuke, the tyme I tald to-forowe; With mony “fare wele” and “sanct Iohne to borowe” Off falowe and frende; and thus with one assent We pullit vp saile, and furth oure wayis went. 24 Vpon the wawis weltering to and fro, So infortunate was vs that fremyt day, That maugre, playnly, quhethir we wold or no, With strong hand, [as] by forse, schortly to say, Off Inymyis takin and led away We weren all, and broght in thaire contree; Fortune It schupe non othir wayis to be. 25 Quhare as In strayte ward and in strong prisoun, So fer-forth, of my lyf the heuy lyne, Without confort, in sorowe abandoun, The secund sistere lukit hath to twyne, Nere by the space of ?eris twise nyne; Till Iupiter his merci list aduert, And send confort in relesche of my smert. 26 Quhare as In ward full oft I wold bewaille My dedely lyf, full of peyne and penance, Saing ryght thus, quhat haue I gilt to faille My fredome in this warld and my plesance? Sen euery wight has thereof suffisance, That I behold, and I a creature Put from all this—hard Is myn auenture! 27 The bird, the beste, the fisch eke In the see, They lyve in fredome euerich In his kynd; And I a man, and lakkith libertee; Quhat schall I seyne, quhat resoun may I fynd, That fortune suld do so? thus In my mynd My folk I wold argewe, bot all for noght; Was non that myght, that on my peynes rought. 28 Than wold I say, “gif god me had deuisit To lyve my lyf in thraldome thus and pyne, Quhat was the cause that he [me] more comprisit Than othir folk to lyve in suich ruyne? I suffer allone amang the figuris nyne, Ane wofull wrecche that to no wight may spede, And ?it of euery lyvis help hath nede.” 29 The long[ë] dayes and the nyghtis eke I wold bewaille my fortune in this wise, For quhich, agane distresse confort to seke, My custum was on mornis for to ryse Airly as day; o happy excercise! By the come I to Ioye out of turment. Bot now to purpose of my first entent:— 30 Bewailing In my chamber thus allone, Despeired of all Ioye and remedye, For-tirit of my thoght, and wo begone, Unto the wyndow gan I walk In hye, To se the warld and folk that went forby; As for the tyme, though I of mirthis fude Myght haue no more, to luke It did me gude. 31 Now was there maid fast by the touris wall A gardyn faire, and in the corneris set Ane herbere grene, with wandis long and small Railit about; and so with treis set Was all the place, and hawthorn hegis knet, That lyf was non walking there forby, That myght within scarse ony wight aspye. 32 So thik the bewis and the leues grene Beschadit all the aleyes that there were, And myddis euery herbere myght be sene That scharp[ë] grenë suetë Ienepere, Growing so faire with branchis here and there, That, as It semyt to a lyf without, The bewis spred the herbere all about; 33 And on the small[ë] grenë twistis sat The lytill suetë nyghtingale, and song So loud and clere, the ympnis consecrat Off lufis vse, now soft, now lowd among, That all the gardyng and the wallis rong Ryght of thaire song, and on the copill next Off thaire suete armony, and lo the text: Cantus. 34 “Worschippë, ?e that loueris bene, this may, For of ?our blisse the kalendis are begonne, And sing with vs, away, winter, away! Cum, somer, cum, the suete sesoun and sonne! Awake for schame! that haue ?our hevynnis wonne, And amorously lift vp ?our hedis all, Thank lufe that list ?ou to his merci call.” 35 Quhen thai this song had song a lytill thrawe, Thai stent a quhile, and therewith vnaffraid, As I beheld and kest myn eyne a-lawe, From beugh to beugh thay hippit and thai plaid, And freschly in thaire birdis kynd arraid Thaire fetheris new, and fret thame In the sonne, And thankit lufe, that had thaire makis wonne. 36 This was the planë ditee of thaire note, And there-with-all vnto my-self I thoght, “Quhat lyf is this, that makis birdis dote? Quhat may this be, how cummyth It of ought? Quhat nedith It to be so dere ybought? It is nothing, trowe I, bot feynit chere, And that men list to counterfeten chere.” 37 Eft wald I think; “o lord, quhat may this be? That lufe is of so noble myght and kynde, Lufing his folk, and suich prosperitee Is It of him, as we in bukis fynd? May he oure hertes setten and vnbynd? Hath he vpon oure hertis suich maistrye? Or all this is bot feynyt fantasye! 38 For gif he be of so grete excellence, That he of euery wight hath cure and charge, Quhat haue I gilt to him or doon offense, That I am thrall, and birdis gone at large, Sen him to serue he myght set my corage? And gif he be noght so, than may I seyne, Quhat makis folk to Iangill of him In veyne? 39 Can I noght elles fynd, bot gif that he Be lord, and as a god may lyue and regne, To bynd and louse, and maken thrallis free, Than wold I pray his blisfull grace benigne, To hable me vnto his seruice digne; And euermore for to be one of tho Him trewly for to serue In wele and wo. 40 And there-with kest I doun myn eye ageyne, Quhare as I sawe, walking vnder the toure, Full secretly new cummyn hir to pleyne, The fairest or the freschest ?ong[ë] floure That euer I sawe, me thoght, before that houre, For quhich sodayn abate, anon astert The blude of all my body to my hert. 41 And though I stude abaisit tho a lyte, No wonder was; for-quhy my wittis all Were so ouercom with plesance and delyte, Onely throu latting of myn eyën fall, That sudaynly my hert became hir thrall, For euer, of free wyll; for of manace There was no takyn In hir suetë face. 42 And In my hede I drewe ryght hastily, And eft-sonës I lent It forth ageyne, And sawe hir walk, that verray womanly, With no wight mo, bot onely wommen tueyne. Than gan I studye in my-self and seyne, “A! suete, ar ?e a warldly creature, Or hevinly thing in likenesse of nature? 43 Or ar ?e god Cupidis owin princesse, And cummyn are to louse me out of band? Or ar ?e verray nature the goddesse, That haue depaynted with ?our hevinly hand This gardyn full of flouris, as they stand? Quhat sall I think, allace! quhat reuerence Sall I min[i]ster to ?our excellence? 44 Gif ?e a goddesse be, and that ?e like To do me payne, I may It noght astert; Gif ?e be warldly wight, that dooth me sike, Quhy lest god mak ?ou so, my derrest hert, To do a sely prisoner thus smert, That lufis ?ow all, and wote of noght bot wo? And therefor, merci, suete! sen It is so.” 45 Quhen I a lytill thrawe had maid my moon, Bewailling myn infortune and my chance, Vnknawin how or quhat was best to doon, So ferre I-fallyng Into lufis dance, That sodeynly my wit, my contenance, My hert, my will, my nature, and my mynd, Was changit clene ryght In an-othir kynd. 46 Off hir array the form gif I sall write, Toward hir goldin haire and rich atyre In fret-wise couchit [was] with perllis quhite And gretë balas lemyng as the fyre, With mony ane emeraut and faire saphire; And on hir hede a chaplet fresch of hewe, Off plumys partit rede, and quhite, and blewe; 47 Full of quaking spangis bryght as gold, Forgit of schap like to the amorettis, So new, so fresch, so plesant to behold, The plumys eke like to the floure-Ionettis, And othir of schap like to the [round crokettis], And, aboue all this, there was, wele I wote, Beautee eneuch to mak a world to dote. 48 About hir nek, quhite as the fyre amaille, A gudely cheyne of smale orfeuerye, Quhareby there hang a ruby, without faille, Lyke to ane hert[ë] schapin verily, That, as a sperk of lowe, so wantonly Semyt birnyng vpon hir quhytë throte; Now gif there was gud partye, god It wote! 49 And forto walk that freschë mayes morowe, An huke sche had vpon hir tissew quhite, That gudeliare had noght bene sene toforowe, As I suppose; and girt sche was a lyte; Thus halflyng louse for haste, to suich delyte It was to see hir ?outh In gudelihede, That for rudenes to speke thereof I drede. 50 In hir was ?outh, beautee, with humble aport, Bountee, richesse, and wommanly facture, God better wote than my pen can report: Wisedome, largesse, estate, and connyng sure In euery poynt so guydit hir mesure, In word, in dede, in schap, in contenance, That nature myght no more hir childe auance. 51 Throw quhich anon I knew and vnderstude Wele, that sche was a warldly creature; On quhom to rest myn eyë, so mich gude It did my wofull hert, I ?ow assure, That It was to me Ioye without mesure; And, at the last, my luke vnto the hevin I threwe furthwith, and said thir versis sevin: 52 “O venus clere! of goddis stellifyit! To quhom I ?elde homage and sacrifise, Fro this day forth ?our grace be magnifyit, That me ressauit haue in suich [a] wise, To lyve vnder ?our law and do seruise; Now help me furth, and for ?our merci lede My hert to rest, that deis nere for drede.” 53 Quhen I with gude entent this orisoun Thus endit had, I stynt a lytill stound; And eft myn eye full pitously adoun I kest, behalding vnto hir lytill hound, That with his bellis playit on the ground; Than wold I say, and sigh there-with a lyte, “A! wele were him that now were In thy plyte!” 54 An-othir quhile the lytill nyghtingale, That sat apon the twiggis, wold I chide, And say ryght thus; “quhare are thy notis smale, That thou of loue has song this morowe-tyde? Seis thou noght hire that sittis the besyde? For Venus sake, the blisfull goddesse clere, Sing on agane, and mak my lady chere. 55 And eke I pray, for all the paynes grete, That, for the loue of proigne thy sister dere, Thou sufferit quhilom, quhen thy brestis wete Were with the teres of thyne eyën clere, All bludy ronne; that pitee was to here The crueltee of that vnknyghtly dede, Quhare was fro the bereft thy maidenhede, 56 Lift vp thyne hert, and sing with gude entent; And in thy notis suete the treson telle, That to thy sister trewe and Innocent Was kythit by hir husband false and fell; For quhois gilt, as It is worthy wel, Chide thir husbandis that are false, I say, And bid thame mend, In the twenty deuil way. 57 O lytill wrecch, allace! maist thou noght se Quho commyth ?ond?

Sluggart, for schame! lo here thy goldin houre, That worth were hale all thy lyvis laboure! 59 Gyf thou suld sing wele euer in thy lyve, Here is, in fay, the tyme, and eke the space: Quhat wostow than? sum bird may cum and stryve In song with the, the maistry to purchace. Suld thou than cesse, It were grete schame, allace! And here, to wyn gree happily for euer, Here is the tyme to syng, or ellis neuer.” 60 I thoght eke thus, gif I my handis clap, Or gif I cast, than will sche flee away; And gif I hald my pes, than will sche nap; And gif I crye, sche wate noght quhat I say: Thus, quhat is best, wate I noght be this day: “Bot blawe wynd, blawe, and do the leuis schake, That sum twig may wag, and mak hir to wake.” 61 With that anon ryght [sc]he toke vp a sang, Quhare come anon mo birdis and alight; Bot than, to here the mirth was tham amang, Ouer that to, to see the suetë sicht Off hyr ymage, my spirit was so light, Me thoght I flawe for Ioye without arest, So were my wittis boundin all to fest. 62 And to the notis of the philomene, Quhilkis sche sang, the ditee there I maid Direct to hire that was my hertis quene, Withoutin quhom no songis may me glade; And to that sanct, [there] walking in the schade, My bedis thus, with humble hert entere, Deuotly [than] I said on this manere. 63 “Quhen sall ?our merci rew vpon ?our man, Quhois seruice is ?it vncouth vnto ?ow? Sen, quhen ?e go, ther is noght ellis than: Bot, hert! quhere as the body may noght throu, Folow thy hevin! quho suld be glad bot thou That suich a gyde to folow has vndertake? Were It throu hell, the way thou noght forsake!” 64 And efter this, the birdis euerichone Tuke vp an othir sang full loud and clere, And with a voce said, “wele is vs begone, That with oure makis are togider here; We proyne and play without dout and dangere, All clothit In a soyte full fresch and newe, In lufis seruice besy, glad, and trewe. 65 And ?e, fresche may, ay mercifull to bridis, Now welcum be ?e, floure of monethis all; For noght onely ?our grace vpon vs bydis, Bot all the warld to witnes this we call, That strowit hath so playnly ouer all With new[ë] freschë suete and tender grene, Oure lyf, oure lust, oure gouernoure, oure quene.” 66 This was thair song, as semyt me full heye, With full mony vncouth suete note and schill, And therewith-all that faire vpward hir eye Wold cast amang, as It was goddis will, Quhare I myght se, standing allane full still, The faire facture that nature, for maistrye, In hir visage wroght had full lufingly. 67 And, quhen sche walkit had a lytill thrawe Vnder the suetë grenë bewis bent, Hir faire fresche face, as quhite as ony snawe, Scho turnyt has, and furth hir wayis went; Bot tho began myn axis and turment, To sene hir part, and folowe I na myght; Me thoght the day was turnyt into nyght. 68 Than said I thus, “quhare [un]to lyve I langer? Wofullest wicht, and subiect vnto peyne; Of peyne? no: god wote, ?a: for thay no stranger May wirken ony wight, I dare wele seyne. How may this be, that deth and lyf, bothe tueyne, Sall bothe atonis in a creature Togidder duell, and turment thus nature? 69 I may noght ellis done bot wepe and waile, With-In thir cald[ë] wallis thus I-lokin; From henn[e]sfurth my rest is my trauaile; My dryë thrist with teris sall I slokin, And on my-self bene al my harmys wrokin: Thus bute is none; bot venus, of hir grace, Will schape remede, or do my spirit pace. 70 As Tantalus I trauaile ay but-les, That euer ylikë hailith at the well Water to draw with buket botemles, And may noght spede; quhois penance is an hell: So by my-self this tale I may wele telle, For vnto hir that herith noght I pleyne; Thus like to him my trauaile Is In veyne.” 71 So sore thus sighit I with my-self allone, That turnyt is my strenth In febilnesse, My wele in wo, my frendis all in fone, My lyf in deth, my lyght into dirknesse, My hope in feer, in dout my sekirnesse; Sen sche is gone: and god mote hir conuoye, That me may gyde to turment and to Ioye! 72 The long[ë] day thus gan I prye and poure, Till phebus endit had his bemes bryght, And bad go farewele euery lef and floure, This is to say, approch[en] gan the nyght, And Esperus his lampis gan to light; Quhen in the wyndow, still as any stone, I bade at lenth, and, kneling, maid my mone. 73 So lang till evin, for lak of myght and mynd, For-wepit and for-pleynit pitously, Ourset so sorow had bothe hert and mynd, That to the cold[ë] stone my hede on wrye I laid, and lent, amaisit verily, Half sleping and half suoun, In suich a wise: And quhat I met, I will ?ou now deuise. 74 Me thoght that thus all sodeynly a lyght In at the wyndow come quhare that I lent, Off quhich the chambere-wyndow schone full bryght, And all my body so It hath ouerwent, That of my sicht the vertew hale Iblent; And that with-all a voce vnto me saide, “I bring the confort and hele, be noght affrayde.” 75 And furth anon It passit sodeynly, Quher It come In, the ryght[ë] way ageyne, And sone, me thoght, furth at the dure in hye I went my weye, nas nothing me ageyne; And hastily, by bothe the armes tueyne, I was araisit vp in-to the aire, Clippit in a cloude of cristall clere and faire. 76 Ascending vpward ay fro spere to spere, Through aire and watere and the hotë fyre, Till that I come vnto the circle clere Off Signifere, quhare fairë, bryght, and schire, The signis schone; and In the glade empire Off blisfull venus, [quhar] ane cryit now So sudaynly, almost I wist noght how. 77 Off quhich the place, quhen [as] I com there nye, Was all, me thoght, of cristall stonis wroght, And to the port I liftit was In hye, Quhare sodaynly, as quho sais at a thoght, It opnyt, and I was anon In broght Within a chamber, largë, rowm, and faire; And there I fand of peple grete repaire. 78 This Is to seyne, that present in that place Me thoght I sawe of euery nacioun Loueris that endit [had] thaire lyfis space In lovis seruice, mony a mylioun, Off quhois chancis maid is mencioun In diuerse bukis, quho thame list to se; And therefore here thaire namys lat I be. 79 The quhois auenture and grete labouris Aboue thaire hedis writin there I fand; This is to seyne, martris and confessouris, Ech in his stage, and his make in his hand; And therewith-all thir peple sawe I stand, With mony a solemp[ni]t contenance, After as lufe thame lykit to auance. 80 Off gude folkis, that faire In lufe befill, There saw I sitt In order by thame one With hedis hore; and with thame stude gude-will To talk and play; and after that anon Besydis thame and next there saw I gone Curage, amang the freschë folkis ?ong, And with thame playit full merily and song. 81 And In ane othir stage, endlong the wall, There saw I stand, In capis wyde and lang, A full grete nowmer; bot thaire hudis all, Wist I noght quhy, atoure thair eyën hang; And ay to thame come repentance amang, And maid thame chere, degysit in his wede: And dounward efter that ?it I tuke hede; 82 Ryght ouerthwert the chamber was there drawe A trevesse thin and quhite, all of plesance, The quhich behynd, standing there I sawe A warld of folk, and by thaire contenance Thaire hertis semyt full of displesance, With billis In thaire handis, of one assent Vnto the Iuge thaire playntis to present. 83 And there-with-all apperit vnto me A voce, and said, “tak hede, man, and behold: ?onder thou seis the hiest stage and gree Off agit folk, with hedis hore and olde; ?one were the folke that neuer changë wold In lufe, bot trewly seruit him alway, In euery age, vnto thaire ending-day. 84 For fro the tyme that thai coud vnderstand The exercise, of lufis craft the cure, Was non on lyve that toke so moch on hand For lufis sake, nor langer did endure In lufis seruice; for man, I the assure, Quhen thay of ?outh ressauit had the fill, ?it In thaire age tham lakkit no gude will. 85 Here bene also of suich as In counsailis And all thar dedis, were to venus trewe; Here bene the princis, faucht the grete batailis, In mynd of quhom ar maid the bukis newe, Here ben the poetis that the sciencis knewe, Throwout the warld, of lufe in thaire suete layes, Suich as Ouide and Omere in thaire dayes. 86 And efter thame down In the next[ë] stage, There as thou seis the ?ong[ë] folkis pleye: Lo!

And lo! quhy so thai hingen doun thaire hudis: 89 For though that thai were hardy at assay, And did him seruice quhilum priuely, ?it to the warldis eye It semyt nay; So was thaire seruice half[del] cowardy: And for thay first forsuke him opynly, And efter that thereof had repenting, For schame thaire hudis oure thaire eyne thay hyng. 90 And seis thou now ?one multitude, on rawe Standing, behynd ?one trauerse of delyte? Sum bene of tham that haldin were full lawe, And take by frendis, nothing thay to wyte, In ?outh from lufe Into the cloistere quite; And for that cause are cummyn recounsilit, On thame to pleyne that so tham had begilit. 91 And othir bene amongis thame also, That cummyn ar to court, on lufe to pleyne, For he thaire bodyes had bestowit so, Quhare bothe thaire hertes gruch[en] ther-ageyne; For quhich, In all thaire dayes, soth to seyne, Quhen othir lyvit In Ioye and [in] plesance, Thaire lyf was noght bot care and repentance; 92 And quhare thaire hertis gevin were and set, Coplit with othir that coud noght accord; Thus were thai wrangit that did no forfet, Departing thame that neuer wold discord; Off ?ong[ë] ladies faire, and mony lord, That thus by maistry were fro thair chose dryve, Full redy were thaire playntis there to gyve.” 93 And othir also I sawe compleynyng there Vpon fortune and hir grete variance, That quhere In loue so wele they coplit were, With thaire suete makis coplit in plesance, Sche sodeynly maid thaire disseuerance, And tuke thame of this warldis companye, Withoutin cause, there was non othir quhy. 94 And in a chiere of estate besyde, With wingis bright, all plumyt, bot his face, There sawe I sitt the blynd[ë] god Cupide, With bow In hand, that bent full redy was, And by him hang thre arowis In a cas, Off quhich the hedis grundyn were full ryght, Off diuerse metals forgit faire and bryght. 95 And with the first, that hedit is of gold, He smytis soft, and that has esy cure; The secund was of siluer, mony fold Wers than the first, and harder auenture; The thrid, of stele, is schot without recure; And on his long[ë] ?alow lokkis schene A chaplet had he all of levis grene. 96 And In a retrete lytill of compas, Depeyntit all with sighis wonder sad, Noght suich sighis as hertis doith manace, Bot suich as dooth lufaris to be glad, Fond I venus vpon hir bed, that had A mantill cast ouer hir schuldris quhite: Thus clothit was the goddesse of delyte. 97 Stude at the dure fair-calling, hir vschere, That coude his office doon In connyng wise, And secretee, hir thrifty chamberere, That besy was In tyme to do seruise, And othir mo that I can noght on avise; And on hir hede, of rede rosis full suete, A chapellet sche had, faire, fresch, and mete. 98 With quaking hert astonate of that sight, Vnnethis wist I quhat that I suld seyne; Bot at the last[ë] febily as I myght, With my handis on bothe my kneis tueyne, There I begouth my caris to compleyne; With ane humble and lamentable chere Thus salute I that goddesse bryght and clere: 99 “Hye quene of lufe! sterre of beneuolence!
