      <field name="fulltext">To my friend Charles Wellsâ</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CLARIBEL OR LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP IN TWO ACTS DRAMATIS PERSONÃ Boleslaus, King of Bohemia Casimir, Prince of Poland, A Friend Albert, a Page, A Friend Claribel the King's Daughter Rudolph and other Princes, Suitors for the hand of Claribel A Courtier Knights, Ladies, and Attendants. ACT I SCENE I. The Court-yard of the Palace. A flourish of horns. Boleslaus and his Knights and Guests returning from the chase, with Servants carrying a deer. Then follow some Huntsmen. FIRST HUNTSMAN It was the prince who kill'd him. SECOND HUNTSMAN You are wrong: Lord Albert gave him his death-woundâI heard Prince Casimir himself tell how it was. FIRST HUNTSMAN Perhaps so: but he ever crowns his friend With the first garland. They were close enough For such an error. SECOND HUNTSMAN You are wrong again. Not half so readily the prince resigns His honours, even to him. THIRD HUNTSMAN There's truth in that: Or else the page does with him as he will. FOURTH HUNTSMAN How long has he been favourite? SECOND HUNTSMAN They were friends Even in their boyhood,âsince your Casimir First visited our court,âsworn friends: the prince Would have none else for his companion. They rode together, hunted, swam, and fought, And studied; none e'er saw them separate. When Albert was advanced to be the page Of our young princess, your prince Casimir Was jealous, as a girl, that he must lose Some hours of him. And in her turn the girlâ The lady Claribelâgrew just as fond; And pined when he must leave her for the wars. There he'd the hap to save the prince's life; And so was knighted, and strode on apace To closer friendship,â'faith, 'tis well deserved: For there's none braver or more mannerly, More true or kind in speech, nor one who bears Himself more nobly, though not nobly born. But all the same he is our lady's page: She will not part with him. When your young lord Left us, some months sinceâSee, where come the friends, Holding themselves aloof from all the rest. Enter Casimir and Albert. ALBERT You have not told me yet what lucky chance Gladdens Bohemia with your step again. CASIMIR No chance, my friend! you have expected me. ALBERT Yes! but so long, that expectation fell Into disfavour, for a lying slave That brought false messages of your return. Why left you us? CASIMIR Well, you shall know the cause Both of my leaving and of my return. I was impatient of the company Of these same wooing princes who have throng'd So many months past your Bohemian court With idle supplications. I was vex'd To see them buzzing round the princess' ears. I had grown up beside her till it seem'd That she belong'd to me. And when they came To interfere, 'twas an impertinence That gall'd me till I could not, even to you, Own my annoyance. So I left them here, Trusting my deeds might well outvoice their words In her dear estimation.âYou are hurt That I kept this so secret? ALBERT Hurt at that! CASIMIR Why then this change of countenance? Your face Is mapp'd with hostile lines. What moves you so? ALBERT I fear this love may sunder us. CASIMIR My friend! Should it not draw us closer, thee and me? ALBERT It shall. Forgive me for a moment's doubt. Enter an Attendant ATTENDANT (to Albert) The princess has been asking for you, sir! CASIMIR Put off your fears; nothing can harm our loves. ALBERT I will be sure of it. CASIMIR Be here again Quickly. ALBERT Ay! presently. CASIMIR I'll stay for you. SCENE II. The Princess' Chamber. Claribel reading; a Lady waiting. Enter Albert. ALBERT Your highness sent for me. CLARIBEL In truth I did; But have forgot my purpose. ALBERT May I wait Till you recall it? CLARIBEL That would be for ever. How have you pass'd the morning? ALBERT With the prince. CLARIBEL You have been hunting with him: is't not so? ALBERT I will forswear it, if it be your will. CLARIBEL Nay: I'd be wrong, to either step between You and your friend or stay your arm from deeds Of manly daring. I must blush to own A woman's may-be foolish timorousness; And you are over-rash. You love the chase (Confess the truth!) more than all joys on earth Save Casimir's friendship. ALBERT Madam! one thing more. CLARIBEL And that, best-loved? ALBERT My duty next your grace. CLARIBEL Is't that weighs down your brows so heavily? ALBERT Nay, madam, 'tis the light that dazzles me. CLARIBEL Your love is light, then. [To her Attendant] Go, fetch me my lute!â I will sing some low song shall charm away Your sorrow with its plaintive melody. I did not deem that love should make men sad. My father's court is throng'd with lovers, fair As summer butterflies,âas careless too. Methinks a gayer, goodlier company Is rarely met with. But perchance your love Is of another hue? ALBERT The self-same hue, Yet somewhat differing. CLARIBEL Differing:âha! I see,â You and your mistress. Trust me, if 'tis so, You love unworthily: for I know none So high may bar your suit. Some arrogant girl Who thinks a peerless knight not noble enough. ALBERT No! no! there is no arrogance but mine: If hopeless reverence can be arrogant. CLARIBEL You are too diffident. Dare you confide Your love to me, that I may plead with her? I'll guess who it may be. How high is she? ALBERT Madam! about your height. CLARIBEL About:âAnd fair? ALBERT Fair as Bohemia's Fairest, as the dawn Of the first, brightest spring; as fair as Hope, Could Hope be the BelovÃ©d. Fair as thou. CLARIBEL If it be not some page's courtly tone, Or cunningest gloss, to me you would address Your nameless praise. I am not vain enough To answerâI deserve it. What heart-words May echoâ ALBERT Lady! if transparent speech Display'd my soul's depth, giving back yourself To your own gaze:âIn the name of loyalty, My most aspiring thought hath ne'er displaced, Yet credit thisâI have not earn'd your scorn. CLARIBEL My scorn! ALBERT O Beautiful! thy very pride Looks angel-like: yet wrongs meâLet me speak! True heart-devotion, ne'er so meanly born, Is homage worthy of a queen's regard; The lowliest truth would kiss her raiment-hem Too noble for her trampling. I am paid With your most distant smile for my best worth; But even my humblest love is no fit slave For your disdain. CLARIBEL (looking in his face) Albert! ALBERT My eyes are dim. CLARIBEL (kissing his eyelids) Canst thou see clearly now? Nay, do not kneel! Rise to the full height of thy worthiness, That my glad soul may look up into thine, My royalest knight! How couldst thou ever doubt? What! scorn of thee? ALBERT My life stands giddily Upon the sunniest peak of happiness. Let me hold fast thy hand. CLARIBEL For ever, love! ALBERT My Princess! ATTENDANT (returning) Madam! you desired me fetch Your highness' lute. There is a broken string. CLARIBEL No matter! Leave us now!âMy song is sung. ALBERT Yet sing again! CLARIBEL If thou wilt sing with me. SCENE III. A Room of State in the Palace. Boleslaus on his throne; Claribel seated at his feet; the Princes standing in front; Knights, Ladies, and Attendants around. BOLESLAUS We wait your slow decision, Claribel! These princes now have sojourn'd in our court Full time enough for the most fickle eyes To make election: difficult at first, Where all are worthy; but a woman's wit And ready apprehension can not fail To note ere long some difference of port, Or manner, or behaviour, which may help Her certain choice. Which of these lords shall be Your husband, heir unto Bohemia's crown? CLARIBEL May I be free to speak? BOLESLAUS Speak as thou wilt! CLARIBEL Then, good my lord! my choice doth light on none. BOLESLAUS Thou hast no choice 'mong all these gentlemen? What then? CLARIBEL I would not wed with either, sir! I speak it not of mere maid bashfulness, Nor frowardly contemning princely worth,â Albeit not for my purchase while my heart Hath no response. My answer is but thisâ I can not choose to wed unless I love. BOLESLAUS Then we must choose for thee. Shall it be said King Boleslaus has play'd with welcomed guests? Yet, Princes! speak to her. Your smoother tones May charm this waywardness. We little like To have our purposes so set at nought. PRINCE RUDOLPH Princess! I pray you to allow my suit. A jewel should be worn and well display'd, Not hidden away: and thou a priceless one With thy rich dower of beauty. For the love Hath so long knit our houses, let me bind Our realms in one dear hope, thy hand in mine. CLARIBEL Prince Rudolph loves the jewel set in gold. It is Bohemia's daughter he would wed: And as Bohemia's daughter I replyâ I am too proud to be his hand-maiden, Even to place the jewel in his cap. ANOTHER OF THE PRINCES Lady! beseech thee let my passion move Thy virgin coldness. Not Bohemia's round Of golden glory, but the sunny light Of all perfections circling thy bright self, Hath warm'd my heart. My life will worship thee With utmost patience, let thy sweet spring smile Shine on me through this winterly contempt. CLARIBEL Let that same patience ask another spring! I do not warm to thee. Thy sunniest speech Thaws not the ice between us. I am fix'd In my first resolution. ANOTHER OF THE PRINCES Yet relent. Set me, dear princess! to some arduous task Whose prize may be thy favour. Let me wear Thy glove, even as a promise, on my helm. CLARIBEL Is then thy courage all so dull to need The spur of a poor guerdon? Dost hold back From nobleness until thou hear'st the price? My father's daughter is not yet for sale, Though honour bid. CASIMIR BelovÃ©d Claribel! Refuse me not, for this: While these have sought Thy favour with word-wooing, I have cared Rather to let the echo of brave deeds Reach thee from far and whisper my desert Than strive to please thine eyes, reflecting back From my unstained armour the glad sheen Of thy most radiant presence, or to mix My words in this midsummer melody. If Fame has spoken for me, may thy voice, Sweeter than Fame's, approve her plea and mine. CLARIBEL Prince Casimir! I should dispraise your worth By scornful words. I fear my speech has err'd From courtesy toward these gentlemen: Yet I would not contemn their dear regards. Truly I thank them that they so affect Bohemia's daughter. My acknowledgment Will heal, I hope, such wounds as I have made. You too I thank, sir! for your kindly thoughts; Which I am all too poor to render back With the sole rendering you could well accept. Too poor, for that my heart has been and is Unsway'd by love toward you. I beseech, Of you and all these lords, construction clear Of my most simple words: I do esteem Your several worths, but none of you I love As she should love who would be royal wife. By your own truths, I pray, believe me now. I do not falter. BOLESLAUS Stay! this shall nÃ²t be. We may not have our policy so cross'd By girlish whimsies. Thou shalt wed perforce. But not to make election blindfolded, To-morrow we will hold a tournament; And there thou shalt adjudge thyself as prize To him who best deserves.âNay, answer not. Princes! we wish that we had girls enough To wive you all; so none might leave our court Unsatisfied. But since that may not be, We pray you hold our loves of equal weight; Nor blame our care that only one can gain. To-morrow shall proclaim Bohemia's heir. We leave you to the tending of your hopes. Exit with Claribel and Train, the Princes following. As they go out PRINCE RUDOLPH (to Casimir) You look not in discarded mood, my lord! CASIMIR Why should I, when to-morrow will amend To-day's deferral? [Casimir and Albert remain.] Albert! look at him. Faith, he's as sad as if king Boleslaus Himself had stamp'd refusal. Let him fear: For hope girds on my sword. Her hand is mine. ALBERT Whether she will or no? CASIMIR A woman's No. But thou hast heard. She has not made a choice: Save that her words to me were gentler-toned. I quarrel not with that. My way is clear. She bids me write the Yes with my own hand. Shall I not snatch her from this summer swarm ALBERT But if she yet should choose; and if her choice Should be another? CASIMIR Think'st thou I would yield? Yield her whose love is more than life to me: For I'd not live without her. ALBERT Would'st thou wrong The gentle love which never may be forced? Would'st savagely o'ermaster the Adored? Or claim her heart even if it gave not back One pulse to thine? CASIMIR If! if!âMy doubtful friend! Thou hast never loved, or thou would'st know that ifs Are meaningless. My mortal enemy I'd grasp with ungloved peace ere I would back One step out of the path toward my love, Even for my brother and most dearest friend. Let them beware!âfor I or the other side, Though ne'er so many, in to-morrow's lists Shall look our last on her. Her hand is mine. SCENE IV. A Hall in the Palace. Retainers lounging about: some cleaning armour, some drinking. FIRST RETAINER I'll wager you prince Rudolph is the man. SECOND RETAINER Not he, but our prince Casimir. THIRD RETAINER I'll hold My master wins. FOURTH RETAINER Or mine. FIFTH RETAINER (from table where some are drinking) But which is he The princess most affects? FIRST RETAINER Why, none, she says. FOURTH RETAINER Ay, says: a woman always says her No. That's good Bohemian for âI thank you, sir!â [To one of the Princess' Attendants passing] Is it not? girl!âWhere runnest thou? We'll have A match at last. Shall it be a double one? GIRL No fear of that: no king will father me. Was I my lady, I would take the veil Rather than marry any against my will. FOURTH RETAINER You'll never have the chance. GIRL Why not? sir Squire! FOURTH RETAINER Because you'd not be able to say No. GIRL Try me! FOURTH RETAINER That's Yes,âand Yes beforehand too. He attempts to kiss her. GIRL Keep off! FOURTH RETAINER But truly, if a woman can, Say, do you think the princess mean'd her No? GIRL What's that to you? FOURTH RETAINER Nay, what a mood you're in. I did not go to offend you. SECOND RETAINER Let her be! But tell us, do you think your mistress cares For none of our young princes? GIRL 'Troth, not I, Unless prince Casimir. SECOND RETAINER He's worthy her. Yet I know one more princely to my mind Even than he. GIRL Who then? SECOND RETAINER Your lady's page. He's kinder; has a gentler way with him; Nor any upstart pride. FIFTH RETAINER He's proud enough With the king's knights. SECOND RETAINER That's true. But not with us. FIFTH RETAINER Then he's one of us. GIRL (passing on) Well, I can't stay here Idling with you. A set of gossiping knaves! SIXTH RETAINER (at the table) Here's to the winner! FIFTH RETAINER You pledge warily. SIXTH RETAINER I am a courtier. FIFTH RETAINER Where may you have learn'd State policy? SIXTH RETAINER The school is not far off; Nor hard to find: under the palace-eaves. SEVENTH RETAINER I like not this rough wooing. What say you? EIGHTH RETAINER It bodes no good. FIFTH RETAINER Tush, man! what would you do? Girls must be married. Who should choose for them If not their fathers? A PAGE Or if not themselves? FIFTH RETAINER Ha! so you boys may fancy,âalways wise In your own mad conceits. A likely judge Your inexperience. PAGE Well, I would not have My father choose for me; nor take a wife Whose only Yes came from her father's mouth. Does it follow that my father's suit fits me? SEVENTH RETAINER The boy's not wide o' the mark; though it is well To have a father's sanction. I ne'er knew That a forced marriage came to any speed. I heard, the king, after he left the lords, Had harsh words with his daughter. He's quicktongued. EIGHTH RETAINER And hasty in his will too. What he says Is done on the spur o' the moment. Well, I hope Prince Casimir may win her. PAGE So do I. NINTH RETAINER (entering) Prince Rudolph even now is taking leave. PAGE He will not risk the fight. SIXTH RETAINER I'm of his mind. A broken pate's a sorry wedding gift. I'd rather keep mine whole, though I was sure To have a crown for plaster. FIFTH RETAINER Will you pledge The winner now? SIXTH RETAINER I'll pledge you any way. FIFTH RETAINER Here's a safe journey to you. SIXTH RETAINER And to you, Fair weather for your wedding. NINTH RETAINER Come! the prince Has call'd for us. SIXTH RETAINER I'm with you. SEVENTH RETAINER It looks black: There'll be a storm by the morrow. PAGE Do you hear How the wind moans? Was not that lightning too, Over the royal chamber? There, again! END OF ACT I. Between the Acts a Tournament. ACT II SCENE I A Garden of the Palace. Albert pacing to and fro. The clash of swords outside; then a flourish of trumpets. Enter a Courtier. COURTIER Prince Casimir is victor. ALBERT My brave friend!â My more than friend!â COURTIER Ah, sir! but you have miss'd The crown o' the tourney. 'Twas a sight, i' faith, Worth staying for. He'll be a worthy lord To our else peerless lady. He will wear Bohemia's glories proudly as he wore The eagle on his helm, that seem'd to sayâ âI clutch the world from all.ââBut you are dull: I thought your joy would kindle at his triumph,â Knowing how much the prince affectsâ ALBERT I wait Your story, sir! COURTIER (Forefend his pageship's spleen! 'Tis something to be friended by a prince, And heir-presumptive. He has hid himself In dudgeon that he might not cross the lists And win a hole in his head, to loose his pride.)âAside. I shall have pleasure tracing, sir! for you The course o' the strife: for 'twas, upon my soul, More like a battle vow'd unto the death Than a mere jousting,âeven for such a prizeâ A princess and a crown. You should have seen Prince Casimir approach, with eyes downcast, To kiss the princess' hand; you would have thought Some pilgrim met a Cross in the wilderness,â He bow'd such adoration, and so held Her white hand in his touch. But when he rose, 'Twas plain to read the victory in his face. I would not have encounter'd such a lip,â Like Fate exultant. I'd have sworn each step Was over an enemy. So, one by one, He met and slew the combatants: not one Had power to make him halt. 'Twas summer play,â A thunder-storm,âthey had no chance with him: Though they fought gallantly. And our good king Sate smiling; and the lady Claribelâ ALBERT Sate smiling too! COURTIER No, sir! she sate as scared. You see she is not like some dames of ours Who love to look upon our manly sports. She is almost too gentle for a queen. Give me a lady whose regard can track A brave man's deeds, nor flinch to see him win. For my partâ ALBERT Sir! I thank you; I have heard. I pray you leave me. COURTIER Sir! at your command. (He seeks some prompt preferment from the Prince: Perhaps to be the new king's chamberlain. I'll travel in his shadow.)â Aside and Exit. Enter Claribel. CLARIBEL My dear lord! ALBERT My wife!âO, dearest! what a chance is ours. How shall I slay my friend? how crush the bloom Of that most noble nature? Yet I find No other remedy. CLARIBEL O, dearest love! Do not ally with wrong to heap more woe. Rather shake hands with Fate to our own loss, Paying her forfeit with atonement calm, Unless it be through breach of our true faith. Ah me! I have no guess of what to urge. The king my father chafes at the least delay: And even now the hand of Casimir Twines in my hair, and his lips seize on mine,â As sealing his possession. My quick sire Chides me that I sit sad and silently; Rating me as unduteous, that I make No cheer to meet my bridegroom. ALBERT He must die. By heaven, what is this man that he should dare O'erstride the threshold of my love? A prince! What's that? A chance. Mine eyes, that front his brow, See there no natural mark of mastership; My blood bounds to the full as free a tide; My soul is robed as royally as his. A chance! a chance succession! he hath won A tourney,â slain some swordsmen. I would fast Three days, not seeing thee, and take his life Despite his strength of birth. That chance, which brought His lips so near to thine, shall bring his head Beneath our feet. CLARIBEL (taking his hands, and looking in his face) Temper this passion, love! Is friendship then so slight that its green boughs, That harbour'd thee so many pleasant days, Can all be stripp'd before one wintry gust,â Its fragrant blossoms all so soon forgot? It makes Love shudder, friend! You will not bring That dull ape, Jealousy, into our home, Among your noble thoughts. Prince Casimir Treats me with delicacy, tenderly, In his respect. And even if friendship's nought, His nice behaviour may enforce some claim To gratitude. ALBERT O, pure-soul'd! thou art right: My fierceness owns thy gentler potency. I will not, come what may, dishonour him. But how to meet this pass? CLARIBEL Your thought be swift! This day he is to wed me,âas some Russ Marries his captive, in his conqueror's garb, Searce having cleansed his armour. ALBERT (Light breaks there.)â Aside. CLARIBEL What say'st thou? love! ALBERT Believe, nought shall be done To hurt our dignity. But I'll be there,â Even at the altar. Only trust in me. CLARIBEL. BelovÃ©d! SCENE II. A tangled Forest. Albert waiting. Enter Casimir. CASIMIR Joy, joy, my brother! Albert! help thy friend To bear his triumph. It is all too much. ALBERT It is. Thou canst not bear it. CASIMIR What mean you? You are moved. What sorrow has invaded you? Forgive me that I did not mark your grief, So full of mine own bliss. What may it mean? ALBERT That I would bear thy triumph. Yes, my friend! Since love and friendship are too great a load Even for thy Atlas shouldersâLet me speak!â Therefore renounce thy love! thou canst not wed Bohemia's daughter. CASIMIR Who would cross me there? ALBERT Thy friend. CASIMIR What friend? Thyself perhaps? ALBERT Even so. CASIMIR This is mere trifling. But for that clench'd lip I should esteem you gamesome, scarce in tune With a friend's earnestness:âbut your harsh words Unfriendlily apparel'dâ ALBERT Do I wear Your livery? sir! CASIMIR You overstep your place. ALBERT Yet I have been the brother of a prince. CASIMIR Brother and friend! you venture on my love. ALBERT No! you on mine. CASIMIR Again, what meaneth this? You talk enigmas; let your meaning out: For that sweet angel at the altar kneels, Waiting to be my wife. ALBERT Then I am plain. That angel never can be thine. Two claim Precedence of thy titleâI and Death. The first may stumble, but the last is sure. Alas! the shades of death have sweeter haunts Than solitary life, or fulsome change That leads but to a grave. Love's wings have flown The circuit of the world, and find therein Nought but the loving. So forswear thy hope! Bridle thy lion-heart until it break! Her marriage-bed is rather in the tomb Than in thy arms. Do anything but hope! CASIMIR As yet I tamely answer thy appeal, So overwhelming in its circumstance: Not understanding how thy birth and rank Should soar so giddily the eagle's height, To thwart thy friend and rush between the troth Of prince and princess, past a king's decree. ALBERT Open thy princely ears, then, to my cause! I have been praised, lord Casimir; my form And port been judged not servile; and mine eyes Have overlook'd the haughtiest. I could stride And grapple with a prince,âay! with the best. Though but a page, my fortune placed me near A princess, and my soul was prince enough To worship her perfection. As I watch'd (The page's duty, sir!) her every mood, I found her sad when I look'd seriously,â Gay when my thoughts made merry,âwhen I sought The lists she paled; and once her glance met mine, And lit me to the chamber of her heart, Wherein I saw my image dearly throned; And ere conceit could lend ambition words Her love stoop'd like a tame bird to my breast,â Where I must cherish it. And, to be brief, Know we are marriedâclose as nature's law Of holiest sympathy can bind two lives. Therefore I bid thee to respect my wife, As a true gentleman; or else affront My honour with thy sword. CASIMIR I meet thy sword, Less deadly sharp than thy injurious words That flame-like bar my Eden. Out, alas! O Claribel! O Queen! what cursed blot Hath fallen upon my 'scutcheon? I, a prince, On the top step of a throne, to be hurl'd down By common hands; and my imperial globeâ Thy perfect loveâtorn rudely from my grasp! O shame! O shame!âUnsay thy traitorous speech: Some fiend possesses thee. ALBERT No fiend but Love. Thy cross-hilt can not exorcize my life. CASIMIR My sword-point shall; or thou step o'er my corse. I will compel her image from thy heart.â By our old friendship, tell me thou hast lied! ALBERT No lie, but truth. CASIMIR Then one of us must die. ALBERT Therefore I sent for thee. For I, my prince! Would have thy armour, wherein I must wed The lady Claribel. Beware thyself! For I will hunt thee for thy beauteous hide. Be brief! She waits my presence with the spoil. SCENE III. A Room of State in the Palace. King Boleslaus on his throne; Knights, Ladies, and Attendants standing around; Claribel kneeling at an altar in the midst. Song of Girls outside. Blessed Hours! approach her gently; Peace! smile on her excellently; Midnight Stars! attend her pleasure. Veil thy splendour, Night! Not even Love's own eyes should measure Love's delight. Touch life's chords with lightest finger; Echoes sweet! around her linger; By the love makes marriage holy, Tame thy carriage, Fate! Like a bridesmaid murmuring lowlyâ Yet we wait. BOLESLAUS Where is the prince our son? A KNIGHT He comes, my lord! Enter One in Casimir's armour and followed by his train of Knights. He bows to the King, and advances to the Princess, who has risen and is looking anxiously around. He takes her hand. My Beautiful! BOLESLAUS We look'd for Albert here: He is not with thy knights. [To an Attendant] Go, seek for him! He seems of late less mirthful than his wont. But his tried faith nor yet his double love Holds him excused from this our festival. ONE IN CASIMIR'S ARMOUR. My lord! I left him some few minutes since,â The cause of my delay. He pray'd your grace, Through me, that he might have some days of leave On his most urgent business. I was bold To answer for your majesty. [To Claribel] My wife! BOLESLAUS Well, well! but we are loath to miss his face, That shone so close to us. AN ATTENDANT (entering hurriedly) My lord! your pageâ BOLESLAUS What means that sorrowful visage? ATTENDANT Good my lord! Forget my sad look in its sorrowful cause. Your page is murder'd. ONE IN CASIMIR'S ARMOUR (to Claribel) 'Tis some error, love! Trust me, it is. ATTENDANT In the royal forest, sire! Not half a league from here:âIt was his dog That led us there, who made us follow him Until we came where underneath a tree, Hid in the brake, we found the murder'd man; Reclining as asleep, with a green bough Drawn tenderly to shield him from the sun. We thought he slept: but a great pool of blood Was at his side,âthe point of his broken sword Lay near, in blood,âand some ten paces off The red, moss'd earth was trampled hard and wet, As he had fought a long and desperate fight. BOLESLAUS He was not dead? ATTENDANT He had his vizor close; They loosed it as I turn'd away, in haste To bring the heavy tidings. SOME LADIES Help there! help! The Princess faints. ONE IN CASIMIR'S ARMOUR She needeth air. Myself will bear her out. He carries her out. BOLESLAUS (to a Second Attendant entering) He is not dead? SECOND ATTENDANT Alas! quite dead, my lord! BOLESLAUS Poor Albert! some one envied thee our love. Search out the villains! he shall be revenged. SECOND ATTENDANT It is the prince, my liege! prince Casimir Is murder'd,ânot the page: we were deceived. BOLESLAUS (pointing to the altar) Who was it, then, stood there? [A long pause.] Will no one speak? COURTIER My liege! if I may venture to be heardâ BOLESLAUS Speak, speak! COURTIER Sire! I have lately taken note Of sundry passages of favour given By your most gracious daughterâ BOLESLAUS Unto whom? Say quickly! COURTIER To lord Albert. BOLESLAUS (striking him) Lying slave!â Who was it that stood there? THIRD ATTENDANT (entering hurriedly) My lord! your pageâ BOLESLAUS (turning fiercely on him) 'Tis false. THIRD ATTENDANT Your pardon, sire! BOLESLAUS What wouldst thou say? THIRD ATTENDANT I crave your patience, sire! Scarce ere I came Into your presence, on his favourite horseâ The one the princess gave him, his drawn sword Beating down all opposal, he flew through The palace gates. BOLESLAUS Say who! THIRD ATTENDANT Lord Albert, sire! The princess borne before him. BOLESLAUS Get thee hence!â Who follows him?â His own reward to him Who drags them to our feet, alive or dead! The Song, repeated outside, is heard faintly. By the love makes marriage holyâ The Song dies away; the wind brings back only the last wordsâ Yet we wait! All pause, then exeunt in confusion. SCENE IV. An Antechamber in the Palace. Enter two Attendants, meeting. FIRST ATTENDANT Where is the king? SECOND ATTENDANT You bring him news of them? FIRST ATTENDANT Yes, yes! but let me pass. SECOND ATTENDANT They're taken, then? Nay, tell me all, and then I'll lead you straight Into the presence. FIRST ATTENDANT Well, I am the first By far: so it does not matter. They are safe. SECOND ATTENDANT Where did you find them? FIRST ATTENDANT Some few miles away. We miss'd them once,âbut found their track again By blood upon the ground. SECOND ATTENDANT He had spurr'd hard. FIRST ATTENDANT It was his own. No doubt the friends had fought Like desperate fiends,âthey were most nearly match'd. It seems his wounds had burst again, and bled Till he grew faint, so that at last he fell From off his horse; and when our troop came up The princess was endeavouring to raise His bodyâfor he seem'd to be near deadâ Into the saddle; and the good horse knelt, As he would help her. 'Twas a piteous sight. There was not even a tear on her white face. But for the king's reward not one of us Had dared to bring them back. She made us weep Though she spoke not a word, even when we took Her lover from her arms. We laid him down Gently upon some boughs: 'twas a kind youth; We all of us had loved him. He ne'er winced The while we bore him; but still smiled on her, Just as a mother smiles on a sick child; And she walk'd by him with his hand in hers, Keeping her eyes on his; and the good horse Follow'd them almost like a funeral friend. As if he knew their sorrow. SECOND ATTENDANT 'Faith, 'tis sad. FIRST ATTENDANT Ah! 'twas a bad deed, friend! to kill the prince. But let me go! SECOND ATTENDANT This way! the king is here. SCENE V. A Room of State as before. Boleslaus on his throne, surrounded by his court; Claribel standing before him. BOLESLAUS Who would have children? Look, my lords! to yours; Use whips, not kisses; bring them up with fear, Not love: or they'll grow wanton, and play tricks In the public gaze, shaming your whitest hairs. Keep them more strict, my lords!âThou shameless girl! To slide, so reptile-like, from kingly arms Unto this slave, this groom, this serving-man. Answer me,âhow did he beguile thy heart, To make thee lose thy honour?âBut, not yet: Say he has spared that. Tell me he has done Some glorious deed, some service of great price In secret peril which we dream'd not of. Say yes! and yet we'll give him half our realm. CLARIBEL I know no serviceânothing but our love. For that I am his wife. BOLESLAUS O wretched slave! Base, groveling, meanly-choosing,âwhen thine eyes Were train'd to the highest. Tell me, haggard! how He lured thee from thy dignity. CLARIBEL My lord! It is your words alone that taint our state.â I pray you hear me. Though my doom was fix'd Before you spoke.âMy father! it was you Who chose this gentleman you now revile, From your whole court. That he was worthy, sir! Be witness his advancement by yourselfâ I plead not to extenuate a fault, But justifying truth.âI saw him brave, Noble, and lovely; my own sight confirm'd Your praise and fame's reporting. But I look'd With woman's eyes, and saw beneath all this A soul that beat in unison with mine,â In brief, sir! that fine sympathy which weds The loving, be their different states most wide,â Which ever draws the one to the other's side Past all convention or world hinderance. True love is nature without baulk of fear: Hast thou a law to bind our natures? sir! I loved him for he was a gentleman,â A king can be no more; and that I found His soul as royal as my own.âO, more: For I look'd reverently to thee, BelovÃ©d! Up to thy royalty.âYou would have given My hand unto prince Casimir, a true And kingly man,âmy husband's friendânot more. Witness how dearly Albert prized my love,â To slay his friend whom he loved more than self. Alas, my lord! love will not brook defeat; Nor is there true election but the heart's.â I pray thee, let the past be strown with peace, And that thou recollect I am thy child, Thy only child, the heir unto thy love. Let not blind wrath usurp my heritage!â For us, our life is one,âour life or death. BOLESLAUS My ears are stopp'd.âBring in this gentleman! [The dead body of Albert is brought in on a litter of green boughs.] Lo, thy Dishonour goeth to its grave. Hide thou close in thy chamber till thou hast sense To weed thy heart. Till then,âtill thou art clear,â I have no daughterânone!âO Claribel! Claribel looks sadly on her father,âthen quietly approaches the couch of Albert. CLARIBEL My gentlest! thou art gone: I haste to thee. She embraces him. BOLESLAUS Raise her! [None move. He comes down from his throne and endeavours to lift her from the body.] Look up!âMy daughter! ONE OF THE COURT She is dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THREE ENGLISHMEN KING ALFRED SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE HARRY MARTEN KING ALFRED What need more seeming dire than Alfred's was, Fleeing from Chippenham that winter night? Poor comfort found he in the woods and fens. In his sure heart alone might faith alight To breathe and wait occasion for new strife. The snow fell softly over Wiltshire downsâ Hiding the horse of chalk out there by Calneâ When Alfred, having hunted Guthrun north, Sat down to keep the feast of Epiphany Within his walls, secure from all molest. The Danish cavalry came o'er the snow With noiseless speed; burst through the city gates, And drove dismay through all the Saxon power Or ever there was time to clutch a brand. Right on the easy town that avalanche Roll'd, whelming, crushing down the revelers; Only some few, half-arm'd, escaped in the dark, Across the Avon, out to the dreary wilds. Seven years had Alfred waged unresting war: Nine battles in one year the king had fought. For ever, as one swarm of Danes was crush'd, New swarms rode in upon the ocean wind: Much as, when one essays to outtread a fire, Fast as this flame expires, yon scattering sparks Inflame quick embers in some other place. Even so those hydra-natured pirates throve. Now all was ablaze again throughout the land: Our first sea victories, Warham's promised peace, And the late gain at Execester,âall nought; Victorious Alfred a poor fugitive, Counted as dead by both his foes and friends, His friends dispersedânone daring look for him, His wide realm narrow'd to a forest lair, Nor power nor vantage-ground save in himself. But whoso holds from God a steadfast will May laugh in the teeth of the most gaunt Despair; Nay, even yoke that beast to pull the car Of his triumphal course above the years. Follow, light Hope!âthou armourer to a kingâ The hero's steps,âthrough all the thicket depth Of his long hiding,âo'er the wild boar's track, And the wide traces of the bounding deer; Follow him through his lonesome wanderings, By moor and dark morass and tangled dell,â Glad if somewhile beside a swineherd's fire His numb hands reinvigorate may trim The arrows, once a terror to the Dane, Now only used to bring the monarch's food. Follow him day by day, night after night; Speak to him in his lone and cheerless dreams; Smile on his aimless path; till, one by one, He meets some loyal subjects of his worth, And breaks a way through the thin-frozen sludge To Ethelingay's Isleâone solid space In the vast breadth of slough, where he may build A refuge from the overrunning Dane, A sanctuary for what few hopes surviveâ Rekindling in them patriot energy. Follow him, Hope! tell him to bide his time. There in his fastness, in the heart o' the waste, The monarch and his little band abode, Enduring hardest shifts of outlawry,â The winged arrows for their pillowing, And sunlight startling them with hostile glance, Making swift forays or for food or news, Snatching such scant subsistence as they could, Inquiring where the Danes, where English souls,â Until they heard how Alfred's old renown Had stirr'd some few brave spirits in the land To new achievement, and how Devon's Earl, Besieged in Kinwith, fiercely sallying forth, Had put to rout the Danish Hubba there With mighty slaughter;âthen the king arose, And loosed his banner, and his war-cry flew Through all the English heavens, and men look'd up, And flung their swords on high to hail the shout Of âAlfred once again for England's war!â Who needeth tell what every child repeats? How as a harper 'mong the enemy The daring monarch pass'd,âamused their sloth With idle song beside their dissolute boards, Spied out their weakness, caught them out of guard, And paid them back the trick of former days. The sun is yet scarce risen on Ethandune, The pirate watchers nod o'er their debauch; At Egbert's stone by Selwood-side have met The best of Wessex, Alfred at their head; Before that sun the fallen wine-cup gilds The Avon shall be red with Danish blood And Chippenham's surprize have like revenge. Thereafter the Defeated wins his way From strife to strife, a crowned conqueror: Taming his former victors, trampling down Invasion on invasion: not without Disaster and due costs of high reward,â A long and weary tale of restless days, Fatigues innumerable, ceaseless cares, Sometimes discomfiture and falling back, And baffled hope, and work to be redone, Zeal forced to drudge like the worst-burden'd slave, And Courage with its armour never off, And Speed ill-yoked unto unequal help: A work like that of Sisyphusâ to roll The rock of sure success to heaven height. For year by year the foemen seemed subdued, Swore peace, departed, and again return'd. But nought can stand against determined will, Stronger than Fate. A ceaseless drip outwears The granite: patient resolution so Softens the stony heart of Destiny. Though even the indomitable Hastings try His subtilest sleights, and war, by genius led, Put forth, Briareus-like, its hundred hands, Striking the king on this side and on that, Compelling his swift presence everywhere, From Romney Marsh and Thames to Severn's mouth, And from the southernmost cliffs to Chester walls,â Though pestilence come in the invader's train, And every form of difficulty strive To farther aid accomplish'd generalship,â Though in ward pain, even from his early years Gnawing out strength, conspire against his life,â Defeat on Alfred never more shall press. For he had met it, and had overcome, In every shade it knows, save oneâdespair: And in that guise it dared not look on him. So stalwart Truth at last was olive-crown'd. And now in his old days the king hath peace; And the land rest,âits trust lain like a bride Upon that royal heart, securely glad. And he, who whilom at the swineherd's hearth Bore chiding for the lowliest neglect, Now leads the nation with his puissant willâ As valourous in peace as erst in war, Seateth bright Justice with him on his throne, Foundeth great universities, and rules His own life with as scholarly disciplineâ Making each hour his steward for good deeds. He, who divided his last bit of bread With some wayfarer, now sends costly gifts Out of his treasury, to farthest Ind; His ships, with Victory's breath to swell their sails, Full-freighted with his fame for many lands, Bring back the homage of the first of earth; And from the heaven whereto his soul aspired His glory beams on us along the yearsâ A star whose splendour may not be outshone. Such is the life of Valour. It persists. Its proud defiance answereth Defeat. It tramples on despondency. It tholes Under God's harrow; bides; and overcomes. Why, the poor spider in Lord Robert's cell Seven times repeats his foil'd endeavouring: Shall Bruce do less? Thence unto Bannockburn Is but a journey, master'd step by step. Rightly did Rome's great senate honour him Who in his country's ruin slew despair. Wait yet by Hope's lone altar, Poland! wait. To-morrow's sun will rise for all these tears. That âisle of Noblesâ to the mainland now Is join'd. So to this isolated act Of English worship let the continent Of later worth adhere! Till England be An Isle of Noblesâthe world's Athelney. GRENVILLE'S LAST FIGHT Our ships lay under Florez. You will mind 'Twas three years after Effingham had chased The Pope's Armada from our English side. We had been cruizing in the Western Main, Singeing some Spanish beards; and now we lay, Light-ballasted, with empty water-casks, And half our crews disabled; our six sailâ Beside two pinnaces and victuallersâ Pester'd and rommaging, all out of sorts. My ship was Richard Grenville's, The Revenge. They knew Sir Richard in the Spanish seas, And told wild stories of him; their brown dames Frighted the babes with fancies of his deeds. So hard-complexion'd was he (they would say) That, when a health was drunk, he crush'd the glass Between his teeth and swallow'd cup and all. And then his blood-draughts.âTush! such idle tales! We only knew a gallant gentleman Who never turn'd his back on friend or foe. Well, lying by Florezâas I told you now, The Spanish force unlook'd for hove in sight: A force of fifty-three great men-of-war. Lord Thomas, taking note of their array, Deeming it vain to grapple with such odds, Signall'd his company to weigh or cut; And so all did except our Grenville's ship. You see, we anchor'd nearest to the town, And half our men were sick on shore. Beside, Sir Richard never hurried from a fight. We got our sick on board and safely stow'd Upon the ballast; and, that done, we weigh'd. By this the Spaniard's on our weather-bow; And some would fain the captain should be led To back his mainsail, cast about, and trust Our sailing. Nothing of that mind was he. He would not soâhe saidâfor any fear Disgrace his flag, his country, or himself; But pass their squadrons through despite of all, Forcing the Seville ships to give him way. And thus he did on divers of the first, Soâas we mariners sayâthey sprang their luff, And fell under our lee. But windward bore A huge high-cargÃ©d shipâthe Spaniards call'd San Philip, took the breeze out of our sails, And ran aboard us. Then, entangled so, Four others, two upon our starboard bow, And two on the larboard, up and boarded us. We help'd San Philip from our lower tier, And flung her back; the other four closed in,â Drove on us like so many hornet-nests, Thinking their multitudes could swarm us down. We brush'd them off and brush'd them off again. The fight began at three o' the afternoon; And all the night through we kept up the game: Darkening the stars and the full harvest-moon With the incessant vomit of our smoke. Ship after ship came on at our Revenge, Ne'er less than two big galleons on her side, Boarding her, as the tides wash up a rock, To fall off broken and foaming 'mid the roar Of their own thunder. They so ill approved Our entertainment, that by break of day They had lost appetite for new assaults; And slunk far from us, like a ring of dogs About a crippled lion, out of reach Of daring that has taught them due respect, Watching till his last agony spends itself. Some fifteen of them grappled us in vain. Two we had sunk, and finely maul'd the rest. But, as day broaden'd out, it show'd our plight: No sail in viewâbut the foes that hemm'd us round, Save one of the pinnaces, which had hover'd near To mark our chance, and now, like hare with hounds, Was hunted by the Spaniards,âbut escaped. A bare one hundred men was our first count; And each slew his fifteen. But by this time Our powder was all used, and not a pike Left us unbroken. All our rigging spoil'd; Our masts gone by the side; our upper works Shatter'd to pieces; and the ship herself Began to settle slowly in the sea. It was computed that eight hundred shot Of great artillery had pierced through her sides. Full forty of our men lay dead on deck; And blood enough, be sure, the living miss'd. Sir Richard, badly hurt at the very first, Would never stand aside till mid of dark: When, as they dress'd his wounds, he was shot through, The surgeon falling on him. Still he lived,â Nor blench'd his courage when all hope was gone; But, as the morning wore, he call'd to him The master-gunner, a most resolute man, And bade him split and sink the unconquer'd ship, Trusting God's mercy, leaving to the foe Not even a plank to bear their victory. What worth a few more hours of empty life, To stint full-handed Death of English fame? Brave Gentleman! I think we had no heart To sink so rare a treasure. Some of us Were stiffening in our pain, and faintly cared For loftier carriage; cowards were there none; But so it was, that we among us chose An honourable surrender,âthe first time Our captain's word refusing. I must own The Spaniard bore him very handsomely. Well-pleased he was to give us soldier terms Rather than tempt the touch of our last throe; And courteously were the conditions kept. The Spanish Admiral sent his own state-barge To fetch our dying hero,âfor our ship Was marvellously unsavoury; and round The Southern warriors reverently throng'd To look upon the mighty in his death: So much his worth compell'd acknowledgment. And well nigh a new battle had burst out 'Twixt the Biscayans and the Portugals, Disputing which had boarded The Revenge. For him, he bade them do even as they would With his unvalued body. A few hours, And Death bow'd down to crown him. Never sign Of faintness show'd he; but in Spanish said These words, so they might be well heard by all. âHere with a joyful and a quiet mind I Richard Grenville die. My life is closed As a good soldier's should be, who hath fought For country's sake, and for his faith and fame. Whereby from this body gladly parts my soul, Leaving behind the everlasting name Of a true soldier and right-valiant man Who did the work that duty bade him do.â When he had finish'd these and other words Of such-like grandeur, he gave up the ghost With stoutest courage. No man on his face Could see the shade of any heaviness. So He and Death went proudly on their way Upon the errand of Almighty God; And God's smile was the gladness of that path. And now immediately on this great fight So terrible a tempest there ensued As never any saw or heard the like. Nigh on a hundred sail of merchantmen Join'd their Armada when the fight was done,â Rich Indian argosies. Of all the host But thirty-two e'er reach'd a Spanish port. Their men-of-war, so riddled by our shot, Sank one by one; and our Revenge herself, Disdaining any foreign mastery, Regarding else her captain's foil'd intent, Went down, as soon as she was newly mann'd, Under Saint Michael's Rocks, with all her crew. The Spaniards said the Devil wrought their loss, Helping the heretics. But we know well How God stands by the true man in his work; And, if he helps not, surely will revenge The boldly dutiful. My tale is done. Sir Walter RaleighâGrenville's cousin, heâ Has given the tale in fitter words than mine. My story looks like shabby beggar's rags About a hero. But you see the Man. The diamond shines however meanly set. Sir Walter laid his cloak before the Queen; But Grenville threw his life upon that deck For Honour's Self to walk on. 'Twas well done. For fifteen hours our hundred kept at bay Ten thousand: one poor ship 'gainst fifty-three. The Spaniard proved that day our English pith. No new Armada on our cliffs shall look While English Valour echoes Grenville's fame. I have some strength left. I will hence to sail With Master Davis. Home is very calm; But Honour rideth on the crested wave. HARRY MARTEN'S DUNGEON THOUGHTS Thou flowest, Stream! beside old Chepstow's walls, Hence to the Severn, and the Severn falls To the wide ocean. I have ceased to flow. And yet thou listenest to the stagnant Woe That overhangs thy banks, like some vain weed Rooted in Chepstow's hoariness. Indeed,â Save that the veriest weed its hope may fling Upon the winds, there as on certain wing Borne to the mainland,âI but weed-like seem. And yet my memory loves to watch the dream Of Harry Marten's triumphs,âthose brave days When Vane outshone me with his steady rays, When gravest Milton scorn'd not Harry's wit, And fierce-will'd Cromwell had some heed of it; When we stood in the breach against the world, And from his folly's wall the Stuart hurl'd Into the tide of ruin. By this tower, If all those glorious days were in my power, I would not reconsider them again, But shout my battle-song to the same high strain, Take the same odds, the same gay daring strife, And the same forfeit of a prison'd life Past even the natural riddance of the grave. Not for himself, O Freedom! would thy knave Ask some poor wages. Let my life be shent, And this worn tomb be all my monument. Dear Freedom! have we vainly toil'd for thee? Our Rachel lostâand our apprentice-fee This Leah, the Evil-favour'd. Shall I laugh, Write on her lips my jesting epitaph, And hug Misfortune for another term? Alas! if hope might set the slowest germ In these old chinks. But England's soil is dead As Chepstow' stones. The blue sky overhead Is all the prisoner's hope in these wall'd years. I need not wet this dungeon-mould with tears; I will not tame my spirit to its cage; As little would I stoop me to assuage Captivity with foolish querulousness. And yet my courage mourneth nonetheless Our ruin'd cause, and that nor sword nor voice Of mine may lead the time to worthier choice: While I rust here like a forgotten blade, And Scot and Vane in bloody tombs are laid. And yet not so, friend Scot!âthy better doom To wait by God until new chance may bloom Out of the barren land men call thy grave: That England which thy virtues could not save, Nor pious Vane lift heavenward from the slough. For me hard penance but atoneth now My many a youthful folly: though the worst Left me a patriot. Wassails quench'd no thirst For the full cup of England's liberty. I never squander'd my great love for thee; And though men call me loose of life and speech, There was no public act they could impeach, And my loose tongue was first which dared to say What hinderance 'twas stood in the nation's way. Or loose or not, it wagg'd to no ill tune Nor out of time. 'Troth, I'll forswear no boon Of this frank life; and now in living grave Am thankful that I had. And that I have: While memory traces back the flow of mirth, From here where it is driven under earthâ As if the Wye had dived 'neath Chepstow's base. God give the stream some outlet of his grace!â There is some reach of joy in looking back On the lost river's current. I can track Its merry laughing gush among the reeds, And how its ripplings lipp'd the blossomy weeds In shallow passages, its songful strife Swift bounding o'er the rocks of active life, And see again the glorious forms whose worth Its sometime deeper water imaged forth. No idle image was reflected there: Not in the stream but on the rock I bear The impress of the Gods who stood by me. Nor was I all unmeriting to be Their chosen companion. Arrows may hang loose: The bowman yet be staunch and mind their use. My England! never one of all thy brave Whose love o'erpass'd my love. I could be grave Whene'er thy need required a solemn brow. What was my task? To give thee room to grow: To give thee sober freedom, godly growth: Freedom and sanctifying worship: both. Milton and Vane and Scot and I at one Were in this work. And I am here alone. And Milton in his darknessâIf he lives. O English hearts! are ye but Danaid sieves Wherethrough like water noblest blood is pour'd? O English sense! what is this word Restored? Restore Heroic Virtue, Holy Strength, Now, Agonistes-like, through all the length Of this great England prostrate! Gyved you lie, Mock'd at by Dalila, your Royalty. I set this dungeon-gloom against the May Of all your Restoration. I will say Against it. I, a pleasure-loving man, Place every pleasure under Honour's ban, And bid you give your country life, and death, Rather than foul the land with slavish breath. Am I a prisoner? Difference between Chepstow and England is not much, I ween. 'Tis but a cell a few more paces wide. Year after year, and under Chepstow' side The muddied Wye still flows. My hair is grey; My old bones cramp'd; my heart this many a day O'ermoss'd with sorrow, like an ancient tomb. Now the old man is harmless, he may roam So far as falls the shadow of his jail. Jail'd for his life. I have not learn'd to quail. Thou askest meââWas it to do again?â I tell theeâYes! the tyrant should be slain. Scot's word is mine: âNot only was my hand But my heart in it.â Here I take my stand; Nor twenty years of solitude can move My conscience from its keep. And so this love, Your pity proffer'd me, must be withdrawn? Well, Harry Marten never cared to fawn. I am alone again, on my grave's edge. And my long-suffering shall be as a wedge To rive this tyranny. I climb thy height, Old feudal fastness! with my feeble might, And see from thee, for all my age is dim, The beautiful rich woods beyond the rim Of Wye and Severn, and the meadows fair Stretching into the distance; and the air Is charged with fragrance; and the uncaged birds Say blithely in the sun their liberal words, Which yet shall wake the tillers of the ground. And lo! the harvestmen are gathering round The banner of God. They put their sickles in; The day of a new trial doth begin. Thou saidst aright, my Vane! it had to be. Nor jail nor scaffold stays futurity. The twenty years have pass'd even as a mist; And now the dying prisoner's brow is kiss'd By his old comrades: Hampden, Pym, and Vane, Fairfax, and Scot, and Ludlow, Cromwell fain To hide old scars and holding Milton's hand, Bradshaw and Ireton: at my side they stand, And the old cheerful smile illumes my cell. âThere is no death nor bondage: we, who dwell In higher realms of faith, assure thee this.ââ Friends! ye say sooth; this cell no longer is A prison; England only is my bound, This coward England all unworthy found. Still you can smile.ââThe resurrection-morn Riseth o'er England's grave; and we forlorn Shall be triumphant. Look thou forth and see Our merry England, kingless, bold and free. We have not lived, we have not died, for nought. The victory we have lost shall yet be wrought: We have not sown high deeds and hopes in vain.â Bright lightning-flash of death! speed through my brain, And sink into the grave my sacrifice: A grave unhonour'd until England rise To avenge the Regicideâ O Martyr Tomb! Thou bear'st the seed of Triumph in thy womb.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE BATTLE OF NEWBURY (20th of September, 1643.) That harvest night we lay in the fields, impatient of the dark, All eager for the trumpet's voice to rouse the slothful lark; For the king had sent his challenge out to Essex and the Right, And Essex flung his answer backâWe meet at morning's light. O many a sleepless eye, be sure! that night did watch the stars, Their silent marches following, so high above our jars; And many a thought might stoop toward the melancholy earth, Whereto so soon we must return for all our martial worth. Even they might ponder in such sortâthose reckless cavaliers; And our raw troopers be forgiven for some unharden'd fears: Not fears! natheless we may be dull in the shadow of the fray, With brothers in the hostile camp, dead brothers ere a day. Now with the dawn King Charles' part on the hill-top stand array'd, Their ordnance planted, horse and foot in their battalions made; And many of their captains brave have thrown their doublets off,â Not so intending battle-heat, but rather triumphscoff. Charge up the hill!âPrince Rupert's horse have met our first attack, With mighty dint upon our force, the foremost pressing back; The tide of our assault recoils, but the wave flows up again, Another, and another yet, the foremost to sustain. Right fiercely Rupert's cavalry salute our city bands; But the blue-coat Londoners are staunch, their regiment firmly stands. Repulsed, the horse wheel round again; charge back, and ours reply,â Till they do not wheel but reel away from our sharp musketry. And yet a third attempt they make, dashing in squadrons full, Striving to break our serried ranks with valour masterful; But the bullet-cloud athwart them bursts, o'erthrowing man and horse. Methinks they will not dare again repeat so warm a course. On swiftly now! Lord Essex leads; his white hat is our guide, One single wreath of snowy foam upon the ocean's pride. On sharply! drive them back once more! on! rally yet again! Beat them from hedge to hedge until scarce two or three remain. Meanwhile the fight holds otherwhere. A mile below the hill They have fallen on our rearmost guard: speed down to check their will! But we pause in mid career, till some the opponent force have known; For they too wear the furze and broom we took to mark our own. Spur through the traitors!âUp again to Essex on the brow! Where the royal ordnance was at dawn our ordnance climbeth now; One with another they dispute, 'gainst cannon cannon's mouth, As if the battle with the day but rose to sultrier growth. And ever the sturdy Londoners oppose the hottest fray; Open to horse and ordnance both, 'gainst odds they make their way; And overmatch'd with mightier odds yet stand undauntedly: The Rupert can not scatter them, they know not how to fly. Even as a grove of pines, that doth the tempest-rage endure, Their heads or branching arms may wave, they keep their footing sure: So these are firmly rooted there, or, only honourmoved, Step forward, gaining on the foe some vantage-ground approved. And so, till darkness sundered us. Yet neither host withdrew; Only upon the hill's far side their horse safe distance knew, With the broken remnant of their foot gather'd behind them there; Our men no less too wearied are to give them much of care. Another morning: we remain the masters of the field. They drew off in the night: their chief a broken hope did wield. We are marshall'd, ready; none appear to the challenge of our shot; One shoutâfor Newbury field is ours! Prince Rupert turneth not. Four earls of Charles' part have fallen, and many hundred more Of English-hearted foemen whom their brother foes deplore. For either side like Englishmen did war with might and main. God send such mournful victory be needed ne'er again! And Falkland lieth there at peace, whose spirit was so sadâ That lofty spiritâfor the wounds his hapless country had. They sayâhe own'd him tired of life ere we began the fight. Well might he be most sad, who knew he strove against the Right. Shout we again for Newbury fieldâthe righteous victory! We shall hear an echoing triumph-shout before a month goes by. Shine thou on Cromwell's Waisby sheaf, O Newbury's harvest moon! âCharge through!â ay, through! âfor Truth, and Peaceââthe truthful conqueror's boon. THE OLD LEGEND OF KING ARTHUR âThou knewest nor fear nor faltering; thy life-vow Of patriot service thou didst well maintain: Therefore, though Death may hide thy valour now, When comes worst need thou shalt return again.â So chaunted in low tones the fairy crew Of that dark barge whereon King Arthur lay, Drifting adown the misty river's flood, After his latest fight. So chaunted they, Staunching his death-clefts; while he, sad of soul, Ponder'd Sir Lukyn's story wonder-fraught: How when Excalibar, at Arthur's hest Flung in the stream, had dipp'd toward the wave, A hand had risen, and grasp'd and borne it down. And thus King Arthur dream'd amid his wounds. âExcalibar, the charmed sword, returns Unto the hand that gave it,âsunk,âdrawn in,â Nor left such ripple as an autumn leaf Reaching the water-marge on Evening's breath. So sinks my life after its turmoil'd years Without a trace: blown from its branch of power,â And Time's dull stream flows o'er it heedlessly. It should not be so. I have served the Gods; Kept myself pure; and stoutly grappled Hope, Till, firm-embraced, our pulses were but one. It is no braggart speech: yon gifted sword Had courage for its handle, and as straight My life was and close-hammer'd as the blade,â True steel that never struck an idle blow. Unto what end its stalwartness? Defeat. Lo, I lie here. The sword hath left no mark.â âThou shalt return again!â the Ladies sang; While the sore-hearted dream'd amid his wounds. âYear after year I strove, and through the fight Bore Hope upon my breast, as one would bear His beautiful bride; and when they slew her there I struggled on beneath her dearest form. O Hope! belovÃ©d, best-belovÃ©d Hope! That brought my Country's ransom as thy dower; O Hope! that I have cherish'd âmid my griefs In long night-watches and through all the din Of battle-storm; ay! even when toil was curst, And knightliest endeavour by repulse Was driven away, like chaff swept from the floor; When field on field beheld me overthrown. Yet never conquer'd: witness Dawn and Eve, That ever found me rising from defeat As clomb the Sun from yesternight's red couch! Would I might battle yet! Give way! I will; And pile our foes upon the last free space Of British earth. Why am I slumbering here, And my good sword not ready to my hand? âYear after year, and ever the same fierce strife Without remission. I was as a pass Through which a host defiles with measured tramp: Squadron hard-following squadron till the earth Rejoices in the custom of sure steps. Let me be buried in the shallowest tomb, Beneath the march of heroes! Death is nought, If I may be a stair to Victory. Where art thou? Victory!âI am here, o'ercome.â And shame, more deep than spear-thrusts, draining life, He lay entranced, nor heard the Fairies' song:â âCalmly the sun drops in its western grave, The seed beneath the glebe, and life to death; To-morrow comes in joy, ripe corn-fields wave, And ever the heroic wears its wreath.â âHow have I fallen? Has the fault been mine? I have not flinch'd from peril, nor counted pains; What adverse odds, what difficult steeps to climb, What possible inconvenience or mishap, Troubled me never. I ask'd nought but thisâ May it serve thee? my Country! Welcome then. Self-care was but a feather in the scale, Or as a spark in one vast-soaring blazeâ The fiery passionate wish to rescue thee. Thou wast my sacrificial altar; I A bridegroom offering. Do I boast? Ye Gods! The boaster has done nothing. Lived and died. He boasts a failure. Give him leave to say He fell as a king falleth.â Where again The Chorus swell'd around him, as a pulse Throbbing indignantly against reproach. âThou knewest nor fear nor faltering!ââstill they sang. âHo! who will follow Arthur to the war? Methought when once our banner was display'd The whole land should have risen as one man. Behold your dutyâForward at the foeâ Had been enough.âThe recreants! Woe is me! They cavil'd at the standard-bearer's name; Doubted the leader could maintain his place; Others were worthier, might be 'mong themselves; 'Twas an unlucky day to close with Doom; Yon covert safest was for skirmishers; Some little forethought till the rest came up;â And so sate down on cowardice, a soft couch, Where some would plan campaigns, as sluggards think In morning sleeps they put their armour on, And wake in bed. But these would never wake: Rotting amid their reveries till the land Stank with the Cowards' Pestilence. 'Twas soâ Brave Hearts that fought by me from first to last! That we were left to meet the invader's whelm: Wrong ever active, while before these homes Right humbly begg'd for alms some stealthy help In her sore want. Even that was oft denied. False-lifed lip-servants! pillow'd warriors! Whose crest should be a liar's cloven tongue,â You barter'd Freedom for a dunghill ease, And let the land of all our glorious sires Be trampled underneath the ruffian heel Of foreign tyranny.âMy soul is drear. âDo I forget you? Arthur's trusty peers! Proud comrades, lovely in your noble strength: My Knights, my Royal Ones! whose words were deeds, Whose deeds were liymns of triumph. Let me die, Since you are fallen. Have the Powers betray'd Your promise? Worth is worthless. Life itself Is falsehood.âIt may be the Powers are weak, Since Valour wins not. Is their own abode Invaded by the Evil of our days?â I am a king, and I may dare to ask.â Are even the Gods grown false and dastardly? I hear the smooth lush whispering of the stream, And, blending with it, words as dreamy smooth. What forms are these that hang above my bier? Where do they carry me, throughout this night?â Defeat, and death, and all before me dark.â But the white garments glimmer'd in his sight For all the darkness,âlike the first of dawn To one lone-watching on some weary height; And the sweet chaunt slid through his barren griefs Like softest rain in fields long parch'd with drought. Ever the Fairies sang, as glode the barge. âThou knewest nor fear nor faltering. Thy sure life Has been an act devout, whose worth shall chain The future to thy purpose. When the strife Hath reach'd its height thou shalt return again.â And one clear voiceâwhose echoes leap'd to shore And stirr'd the dead upon the battle-groundâ Sang yet again: the King forgot his wounds. âThy true adventure was a living seed, The harvest of the Eternal can not fail: Thy spirit shall return, at their worst need To help whom now thy arm may not avail.â It is a fable of the meed of Truth: Most knight-like Truth, that, scorning sloth or fear, Hastens to meet the Evils of the time; And, be he ne'er so poorly companied, Dares all their force, copes with their fiercest tides, Defies disaster and despair itself, And leaves upon the sorriest place of deathâ Where hopes are scatter'd like autumnal wrecksâ A memory that shall live and bring his name In fire to the hearts of new endeavourers,â Leading them from the gloomiest depth of care, Even when their need shall be most desperate, With power as if his Angel had return'd To avenge the past defeat with victory. True-soul'd and valiant! Arthur! come again. Is not our need enough? What voice replies? THRENODY IN MEMORY OF ALBERT DARASZ (London, 19 Sept., 1852.) Another death! another Martyr lain In the Exiles' Tomb!âO Grief! thy fangs are sharp; And these heart-cleaving agonies threat to warp The hopefullest spirit from its upward strain. Alas! the higher hope, the farther fall: And more than lofty hope must be thy pall. O unaccomplish'd hope! O grief of griefs, When the sap faileth ere the worth is ripe! Thou proud fruit-bearer, whom Decay doth wipe, As a mere painting, from life's page! The chiefs Of the world's worthiest look'd to thee for aid; And we to worship in thy branching shade. The axe hath struck thee in thy manhood's prime: Thy purpose unmatured: so fairly blown Thy blossom, and the fruit set: all foreknown The richness of thy virtue, the sublime Eternity enkernel'd in its growth. Thy life read to us certain as God's troth. Far from thy home thou liest; strangers' ground Must pillow thy sad sleep. Some two or three, Thy brother-exiles, doubly kin to thee, Their tears long since exhausted, droop around Thy narrow deathbed: hearts that may not break,â Harden'd against thy loss for Poland's sake. Over thy grave no tears; but death-like clasp Of hands that may not wave thee back to shore! Thy tomb is but one martyr-stair the more, Whereon we mount the martyr's crown to grasp. O Friend! we dare not whisper Hope to lay Our bones by thine. Our hope must turn away. Must turn even from thy ashes, Well-beloved! Not thou, nor ought but our relentless task, May claim our thought. And yet, if toil might ask A guerdon for the toiler worth-approved, 'T would be some weary hours, toil-spared, to gaze Back on thy life, re-studying all its praise. In vain! Recall the past! Recall thy life!â The shadow followeth the vanish'd form; His grave is yet moist earth, their tears are warm: But flowers spring up, new blossoming smiles are rife. Not unto us. Thy shadow clouds the world, Deepening the gloom wherein our life was furl'd. For we have lost thee; and, though round our brows The hastening hours entwine their dearest wreath, Our country's freedom and the world's, thy death Would shade the laurel blossoms. How carouse The full of joy above thy distant grave? Despair hath buried all in that sea cave. Ah, no! God's world is wider than our earth. What is this earth? A narrow altar-stone, Which thou, brave friend! did'st lay thy life upon For God: a sacrifice of endless worth. All worth is endless, thou must live therefore: Part of the Eternal Work for evermore. We look to see again thy form divine; We pray to follow on thy path. What prayer? The vow that slayeth even grief's despair, The prayer of deeds of the same high stamp as thine. Stay for us, Angel! within heaven's gate: Thy ancient comrades call on thee to wait. Our arms again shall hold thee to our heart; Our eyes again shall read thy inmost soul; And foot by foot toward the higher goal Our lives shall climb:âGod! nevermore to part. Pray God to snatch us up to heaven's gate: Lest thy swift-soaring spirit should not wait. The sun is down; but in the western clouds The lengthening trail of splendour grandly lies: The hem of Hope yet glistens in our eyes. And what though night the sunniest memory shrouds? God hath a morrow for the loving. We Will grieve no more for one lost utterly. Memory and faith shall lift us to thy side. So shall our thought be wing'd, even as the dove Of comfort, that the weary ark may move Toward the shore. And whatsoe'er betide Our lives,âdo we not know that thou art free From earth's lament, from earth's anxiety? O blessed Dead! beyond all earthly pains; Beyond the calculation of low needs; Thy growth no longer choked by earthy weeds; Thy spirit clear'd from care's corrosive chains! O blessed Dead! O blessed Life-in-death, Transcending all life's poor decease of breath! Thou walkest not upon some desolate moor In the storm-wildering midnight, when thine own, Thy trusted friend, hath lagg'd and left thee lone. He knows not poverty who, being poor, Hath still one friend. But he who fain had kept The comrade whom his zeal hath overstept. Thou sufferest not the friendly caviling Impugning motive; nor that worse than spear Of foeman,âbiting doubt of one most dear Laid in thy deepest heart, a barbed sting Never to be withdrawn. For we were friends: Alas! and neither to the other bends. Thou hast escaped continual falling off Of old companions; and that aching void Of the proud heart which has been over-buoy'd With friendship's idle breath; and now the scoff Of failure even as idly passeth by Thy poor remains:âThou soaring through the sky. Knowing no more that malady of hopeâ The sickness of deferral, thou canst look Thorough the heavens and, healthily patient, brook Delay,âdefeat. For in thy vision's scope Most distant cometh. We might see it too, But dizzying faintness overveils our view. And when disaster flings us in the dust,â Or when we wearily drop on the highway-side,â Or when in prison'd, exiled depths the pride Of suffering bows its head, as oft it must,â We can not, looking on thy wasted corse, Perceive the future. Lend us of thy force! No more of grief!âThy voice comes to us now, Answering our invocation. We uplift Our eyes; and, looking through the tempest-rift, Behold the light of thy triumphant brow There in the line of God. Lest we should miss His farthest throne, he neareth us with this. EURYDICE (âOrpheus' Sweetest Song.â) From out the thick shade of a laurel grove (Crowning a little knoll of sacred ground, Like to a wreath forlorn hung o'er an urn,) Issued a dim and melancholy voice, The tender air infecting with sad breath. The yellow leaves dropp'd down the failing light, The autumn wind crept slowly through the boughs; The wind and falling leaves with low sweet tones Echoed that plaint, till the great pulse of life Seem'd but the ebb and flow of one long sigh. âEurydice! Eurydice!â was all The burthen of that sorrow: but anon These words came sobbing forth from a burst heart, Gushing in full flow of abandon'd grief, Like the low pining wail of Philomel. âEurydice! mine own Eurydice!â O Earth o'er which her music footsteps moved; O clear blue Sky, not deeper than her eyes; Thou Forest-shade with sunlight leaping through, Not sunnier than her laugh,ânor lovelier that Than her thought-shadow'd depth of seriousness; Ye Torrents, grandly falling, like her hair; Ye honey-clefted Rocks, firm as her truth; And ye sun-kissed Slopes of harvest land, Smooth-rounded as the blessed globes above Her fertile heart: O Earth and Sky, O Life,â That speak to me of her in every tone, That spoke to me of her in every word:â Why are ye beautiful, and She no more? âYe Hamadryads, with brown arms enlaced, Leaning against the gnarled trunks, half-veil'd In flood of level sunshine, your bright eyes Flashing amid green leaves; or ye who glide Mistily down dim aisles, with gentle feet Responsive to the gentle fall of rain Dropping upon soft turf from lofty boughs, And glistening in the moonlight, like quick tears Upon a smiling face:âwhy do ye mock My longing with vain phantoms, till mine eyes Strain to the distant purple of warm eves, To reach her form? why do ye play with grief? Ye Naiads pure, calm-flowing in the cool Of overhanging foliage, your lank hair Trailing along the current,âwhy do ye Babble with ripply lips that sweetest wordâ Eurydice, until the blabbing reeds That told King Midas' secret whisper mine To every wind, till every trickling wave Repeats my woe in more melodious tone? Ye Nereids, with your coral crowns, and plumes Of waving weed, and blue hair in the spray Caught on the wave's edge by some eager breeze,â Why do ye haunt the sea-board with your grace? Still rusheth up the shingle and returns The melody of dancing feet, and round The smooth-cheek'd pebbles slides the creamy foam. Eurydice!âO Presences and Powers Of Nature, once so dear, my heart is deaf To your best witcheries. The strings are rent. My lyre no more can answer your delight, Nor with glad notes provoke your swift reply. âEurydice! my lost Eurydice! No more thy bounding limbs are eloquent. On the smooth beach our Greek girls, as of old, Dance in the twilight: in the torches' glare, Answering the passion of the westering sun, Their warm cheeks flush more rosily; I see The gleam of their uplifted arms, as each Hastily in the mazes of the dance Passes the flame unto some sister hand; I hear the song, borne by the gentle-voiced, Close-following upon the trail of fire In all its windings,âthat dear Freedom-song Our youths and maidens love; and I can hear The sweet time-beats of soft feet on the sand:â Eurydice! Eurydice! no more Thou lead'st the chorus. Freedom, Fatherland:â Eurydice! the future as the past Is buried in thine urn. I have no hymn. The torches are extinguish'd; the drear sea Moans in the gloomy hollows of its caves. âO thou vast soul of Nature I once waked With lightest touch! O throbbing heart of Life That used to listen fondly to my lyre Made eloquent by her! I do appeal Unto thy grateful memories. Alas! The pulse of Life is no more audible.â Dryads and Oreads! wherefore have we laid Our oil and milk and honey at your feet? O Nymphs of forest, mountain, plain, and flood! Why have we pour'd our songs more honey-sweet, Our oil-smooth songs, our rich and fruity songs,â Why have we borne our Dionysian songs To you, making you jocund with much mirth, And ye are silent now? O gentle Nymphs! Have ye no drops left in your brimming cups? Dear Echo! has thy sympathy no word, No drained flavour of those richnesses, To bring to my dry heart in her dear name? Ye Satyrs! wont to troop around our path, With rude, broad gambols, your most awkward speech Were musical as Phoibos' golden tongue, If you would tell me whither She is gone. I pray to you, for all my household gods Are scatter'd. Unto you the Homeless prays, Powers of the waste and solitude, once loved! âEurydice! my own Eurydice!â Alas! no voice replies: the Earth is dead.â My Beautiful! whose life was as the crown Of festal days,âwhose blush was as the bloom On the full fruit,âwhose days were as ripe grapes, Clear and delicious on one cluster growing; My Beautiful! whose smile moved o'er the earth Like the first sunbeam of the year,âwhose voice Was the mild wind that whispereth odourously Unto the yearning buds that Spring is come; More beautiful than Eos rosy-brow'd, Or than the arrow-bearing Artemis,â Thou Dawn of my existence, Promiser Of glorious days, thou pure Light-bearing One Chasing the shadows from across my path When night hung darkly o'er my clouded thought; Thou spirit of my potent lyre, now mute; Thou Genius of my life; thou Life; thou Song; Eurydice! my own Eurydice! âShe is not dead: this death is but a dream. Where art thou gone? Eurydice!âReturn, Ere doubt hath grown to madness!âIt is not. The serpent did but coil around my sleep. Eurydice!âSweet Echo! she will come, Prank'd in thy guise, out of the forest depth, And smile on me with that deep-hearted smile, More radiant than Persephone's when closed Her welcoming arms around Demeter's head Bow'd with its sheaf of joy upon her breast.â Alas! the mourning friends, the solemn priests, The virgin train, the sobs that hid the cry Of painful steps toward the funeral pyre,â Alas! this little urn clasp'd to my heart, This empty husk of life, this loneliness, This death of life,âattest that thou art not: That Sorrow lives, but not Eurydice. âThou shalt not die! O Son of Zeus, who brought Alcestis to this upper air, attend My dearer quest! I will descend to her, And with my fervent song require from Dis My own Eurydice. She shall return Unto this pleasant earth. Persephone Will listen as my words shall fill her lap With Enna's flowers, and in her eyes shall look Demeter's mother-glances till her own O'erflow with ruth, and she shall wind her arms Around the gloomy king and him conjure To give me the BelovÃ©d to my song. Or my whole life shall stand amid the shades, Before the Fates, and with its chaunt enweave Her thread of life anew. I will bring back Her beauty to the earth, and live again, Strong in the sunlight of her summer love: Even as a tree that lifteth up its head After a storm, and, shaking off the weight Of passed tears, laughs freshly in the sun. And yet again, her hand upon my heart, My lyre shall speak unto the Life of things; And the fair Nymphs crowd round us as of old; And even Satyr shapes look beautiful; And the dumb Spirit of the Inanimate Be stirr'd into expression; and the Earth, Hearing the music of thy thoughts, BelovÃ©d! Grow beautiful as thou art, till the world Resume the glory of the olden gods. âEurydice! my own Eurydice! My grief is at my feet. My will is strong. My soul hath pass'd the ferry of despair; My song pours forth resistless eloquence; My voice is firm; the Inexorable Three Relent. Persephone amid her tears Clingeth impassion'd to the knees of Power: Thou canst not hold the Loved; she shall return. There is no deed impossible to prayer, To faithful will.âI hear thy following feet, Most musical of echoes; step by step I count those dearest of dear promises, Conquering the steep ascent; I see the light Of our old life; I hear thy eager pants Closer and closer; now thy fragrant breath Kisses my neck, thy passion-parted lips Lean forward, and the music of thy curls Touches my cheek,âMine own BelovÃ©d One, Eurydice, mine own Eurydiceâ O God! O Sorrow!ââ Life is all a dream. The Past returns not. Look no more behind! It is a phantom. Rather let thy song Mount as a pyre-flame up into the heavens. O Constellated Beauty! thou art there. Not on the earth, nor with the buried Past, Lo, thy Eurydice awaiteth thee. Eurydice! Eurydice! QUEEN LIBUSSA (WHOSE LOVE SOUGHT THE LABOURER) O that Queen Libussa! None so fair as she: With the wisdom of her choice Ruling royally. How her lieges did rejoice In their loyalty! Beautiful Libussa! Queen in her own right Of exceeding beauty, And that clear insight Unto the heart of dutyâ Which makes toil delight. White horse! in the sunshine Speed thou o'er the land, Bounding like the Elbe's white spray Over the golden sand:â Twelve proud nobles track his way, By the Queen's command. Riderless he seeketh Whom the Queen would see:â âOn iron table dineth Under a lonely tree He for whom fate designeth Bohemia's royalty.â White horse! in the sunshine Speed thou o'er the land; Through the broad Elbe, through the spray, Over the golden sand; Through the wide fields choose thy way, Guided by no hand. And the nobles follow; Slow their speed to his: Never the white horse resteth, Never his way doth miss: âBy our Lady, if she jesteth, Wearisome jesting this!â From her tower she watcheth: Her assurÃ©d glance SaithâMy choosing may not drift On the waves of chance: And now her sunniest smiles uplift Her perfect countenance. Toil the milk-white bullocks, In the sultry air: Rest they now in the pear-tree's shade; Rests the ploughman there; Resting dines, the black crust laid On the bright plough-share. Speed thou through the sunshine, White horse! to his side; Stoop thy proud neck,âthou hast found him, Found the Prophesied: And the nobles crowd around him, Heralds from his bride. Bring the robe of purple, Golden spurs and sword! This is he whom we have sought; This is Toil's reward. So they to Libussa brought Her Bohemian lord. First his staff he planteth, Heaps the earth around: Lo! the hazel buds are springing; And his thoughts unbound Seeds of prophecy are flinging O'er the furrow'd ground. So doth Love enlighten; So doth Labour freed All the golden story Of the future read: But now, in the present glory, Is no prophet-need. Swift as swiftest sunshine, Swift as lover's thanks, Swift as the foaming Elbe's white spray Over the golden banks,â Yet ever the golden rowels pray In the tireless courser's flanks. O thou queenliest beauty, Beyond all compare! Reverently he kneeleth, Soul-submissive there,â Till his lips she sealeth, And his wild eyes veileth Underneath her hair. Ever so, BelovÃ©d! Kneels my soul to thee,â Evermore to render Life adoringly, Thou pale star, whose splendour Crowns my poverty! Yet shalt thou, Delightful! Hold the Future's chain, When thou trusting loosest Labour's steed again,â When the Poor thou choosest By thy side to reign. THE BRAVE WOMEN OF TANN [There is a little town in the Vosges, where on all public occasions the women take precedence of the men, in virtue of their conduct related below.] Sate the heavy burghers In their gloomy hall, Pondering all the dangers Likely to befall,â Ward they yet or yield the strangers Their beleaguer'd wall. âAll our trade is ruin'd: Saw I this afar,â Said I notâour markets Month-long siege will mar? Let not our good town embark its Fortunes on this war. âNow our folly takes us: War first hath his share, Famine now; who dreameth Bankrupts can repair Double loss? or likely seemeth Victors should despair? âAnd our trade is ruin'd: Little that remains Let us save, to hearse us From these bloody pains, Ere the wrathful foe amerce us Of our farthest gains!â Up and speaks young Hermann With the flushing cheekâ âShame were it to render: Though the wall be weakââ Say the old menââLet us end or Certain death we seek!â In their gloomy chamber Thus their councils wend:â âFive of our most trusted With the morn descend; SayâSo peace may be adjusted Chained lives we'll spend. âNow home to our women! They'll be glad to learn We have weigh'd so gravely âPeaceâ hath fill'd the urn: Though in truth they've borne them bravely In this weary turn.â Home unto their women; But each burgher found Scorn in place of smiling: For each good-wife frown'd On this coward reconciling, Peace with honour bound. In their morrow's council Woman voices rise: âCount ye babes and women But as merchandize, To be traffick'd with the foemen,â Things of such a price? âWe will man your ramparts; Ye, who are not men, Go hide in your coffers! We will call you whenââ Slid home 'mid the crowd of scoffers Those five heralds then. In the morrow's danger Women take their share; Many a sad grey morning Found them watching there: Till we learn'd from their high scorning To make light of care. Chief with our gaunt warders Hermann's young Betrothed Pass'd, like Victory's Splendour,â In bright courage clothed: Fear hid, fearful to offend her, Knowing himself loathed. Blinding red the sunset! In that hopeful breast Stay'd the foeman's arrow So 'twas won. The restâ How Despair in strait most narrow Smote the Conqueror's crestâ Matters not. Our women Drove him to his den. 'Twas his last invasion; We've had peace since then.â This is why on State occasion They precede our men. THE CAPTIVE ARAB The captive of his bow and of his sword, I dwell within his walls and can not leave; Though ever in the absence of my lord Hopes of escape I weave. But he returns and holds my hands in his, My heart to his, and all the hopes are gone; And I forget my restlessness in bliss With that BelovÃ©d One. Woe, woe is me, a wretched prisoner! A fetter'd slave! a bondwoman! a thrall! Now he unbinds me, yet I can not stir: His love binds more than all. O joy! great joy! my lord comes home again: My lord, my loved, my master and my king! My own BelovÃ©d! this one passionate strain Amends all suffering. AndââDost thou love me well?â I meet his smile With radiant answer: Love makes bondage sweet; I would not leave thee. In a little while My joy is less complete. And longings for old Araby returnâ My Araby the Blest. Love's hearth is dim. So strong the thoughts with which I can but yearn, I scarcely think of Him. My free wild Arab life! This place grows dark,â This narrowness is dreadful as a tomb. Ay! in the Temple and before the Ark I'd pine for want of room. My free delightful Araby! my life! My roving independent carelessness! It is a yokeâthis destiny of Wife: I love thee ne'ertheless. It is a yokeâO very hard to bear, For one who never knew constraint or let. I am not fit for this. I can not wear Your homely jewels yet. Though I will try. Dear Love! I kiss thy lids, And draw thee sleeping closer to my heart. What restless dream another kiss forbids, Lest I should ne'er depart? Lest I of slavery should grow so fond As to rejoice in it for thy dear sake? Never! my wings are crush'd, my hopes despond, My heart can only break. In mine own wilds I was a wilful queen: How can I take a menial's place and form? Love's heaven is highâyou tell me, pure, serene. The eagle loves the storm. I must be gone. His eyes are closed in sleep, Weary with love; I put him from my breast. One kiss: Love! thou art strong, but canst not keep Thy wild bird in its nest. I must make haste to go before he wakes, Before his arms encircle me again As with a band of iron (my heart aches With love and restless pain), Before his eyes can look their fond reproach, Before his waking touch thrills through my heart. How to keep back these thoughts that will encroach Whene'er I would depart? He woke soon as I turn'd, and I return'd: His look was as a chain I could not break. I tried to bless him in whose fire I burn'd, Who tied me to the stake. And so again some days of plaintive joy, Of happiness. Indeed I love thee well: Thy love makes present gold of my alloy, A heaven of my hell. But in thy absence! O, it can not be. I will depart now. I will not be led Bound to thy triumph, no! not even by thee, Not to a bridal bed. Thou hast unbound me; I take up my bow And the old arrows; I halt not to test The slackness of the string; I leave thee now. Yes! leaving thee is best. Forget me and make merry in thy home With one more fit for bondage and delight. More loving eyes shall look on thee, and some Be pleasant in thy sight. For meâO how I hate this closing wall! I must be gone. My will speeds through thy gates. When thou return'stâO Love! Love! Love! thy thrall Upon the threshold waits. THE RUINED CITY So that great city underwent the curse Of silence, till its very life was death: Until all outer act was but the hearse Of its inborne monotony of breath. The doer went abroad to daily toil; Did, and came duly back against the night; Wearily won and sadly wore the spoil,â A woe-worn victim even for all the plight Of wreathÃ©d victory (that fearful doom Had struck out love and joy and worthy pride And energy): he was as one to whom Is given a soul's work, yet the soul denied. He did, because it seemed right to do; He lived, because he had no wish to die; His life was death; there was no change, he knew,â For death seems only life borne silently. And all the city underwent that spell Of burying hope beneath their sealed lips: As if the sun was gone, and none might tell Even his own heart the end of the eclipse. A people without hope. Stern Faith awhile Held on. But Faith has sometimes need of Hope. So Faith's closed lips at last fix'd in a smile Of sullen scorn: a smile that might not ope The low dark room of the sepulchral heart,â Wherein one tenant was, the trailing thought Of many-coiled sorrow, whose fell smart Was painless now, and only torpor wrought. Till even the merest form of life became Too burdensome for stoutest will to bear: One might as well suppose a motionless flame As life fed only on a still despair. The living hopes had made the city great, The hero strengths had built its palace pride, Lay down in the grassy streets, dull-eyed, to wait The slow repeats of morn and eventide. The palace towers crumbled unrepair'd; The city gates were shut, and none went forth; Weeds choked the glorious ways, and no man cared; None spoke: since Hope forsook the City of Worth. There in the ruin'd temple once had stood Her statue beside Faith. Hers fell that day She pass'd out thence. And now in the solitude Beneath the feet of Faith her image lay, Shatter'd to pieces. Wherefore this still fate, This silence, this accursÃ©d penalty. The Gods desert us. We not even wait The useless Death: for, living thus, we die. Faith's statue yet remain'd: a piteous sight: Clothed by great spiders, hooded thick with dust, Worshipp'd by unscared vermin day and night, The marble flaw'd, the gold devour'd by rust. So the long years crawl'd on. What lived or died In the great city matter'd unto none. Oblivion! be merciful, and hide The wasting misery of the overthrown. One word alone had been the mighty leaven Out of this sealed tomb to raise the dead, To lift despair from hell to highest heaven: One only wordâthat never may be said. FIVE SERMONS FROM ONE TEXT: EVEâTHE INDIAN WIDOWâVESTA'S PRIESTâJEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTERâIPHIGENIA AT AULIS EVE Flung out of Eden, and my child is Cain. Woe, woe is me! I have pluck'd knowledge, and I find it pain. Love hath made me accurst: since all the gain Of self is misery. O fierce desire that would not let me rest! O lovely snakeâ Thou subtilest beast, that with thy low behest Lured me from innocence!âFrom good to best My way I take. For innocence is not the best, though good. Thy gates are shut, Sweet Eden!âI return not if I could. Better, O Man! hard labour and scant food In this poor hut. From innocence through sorrow and much wrong Our pathway lies. Only by suffering doth the soul grow strong. Leave we the lower creatures, the vile throng Of sense. Arise! Forth to the desert! We will plant out there A garden brave. This doom of death, this darkness of despair, Is the shadow of higher Love. And look thou where He bursts the grave. THE INDIAN WIDOW Through the purifying fireâ Upheap the sandal-wood, and thereupon Throw cinnamon, Rich-scented gums, sweet frankincense, and myrrh; And pour the holy oil Over the forest spoil Till the flame enrobeth her!â âI aspire!â âThrough the purifying fireâ âWith the dead BelovÃ©d lying at my feet, âAnd music sweet âClimbing the golden smoke toward the sky; âThe white flowers in my wreath âCrowning me Bride of Death. âLet the earth pass cloudily! âI aspire!â Through the purifying fireâ True Spirit! free thyself from robes of sense; Soul! grow intense; Devotion! climb unto Love's highest throne. Behold, O seeking eyes! The pile of sacrifice, And the flame for bridal zone.â âI aspire!â VESTA'S PRIEST O white-robed Vesta! to maintain thy flame I swear. Bow, proud patrician! From thy snowy hair, O Wisdom! take the crown. Kneel humbly down Ye warriors! and ye, reverend priests! bend low Before the Sacred Virgins as they go Along the public street: Blessing the way with feet That tread down shame. O clear-eyed Vesta! O neglected flame!â O Death!â Close veil her weakness! lead her hence beneath The all-concealing earth! Why speak of worth, Of innocence, of natural loving need? We hear in vain, we may but heed The worship and the oath. Unfaithful to her troth, We bury Shame. Divinest Vesta! Mother of the Powers! Inspire My heart, and fill me with thy purest fire. Choose for thy lamp this soul, To show the goal Of virtue, only in thy temple gain'd By lives ungrieved, unstain'd. Keep me above the earth! Kindle within me worth For all the hours! JEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTER Give me a little while to mourn my youth!â This lightning is too swift. Let me beholdâ One instantâif thy vow have so much ruthâ Hope's violet tints melt in the ruddy gold. Let me chain back the flood-gates of my tears, Harden these quivering lips, hot cheeks make pale; Let me gaze firmly up the marbled years Even to the utmost bleakness I must scale. It was a wild vow, O my Father!âwild As all vows are: rash Will outreaching Right. Nevertheless I am thine own true child. Slay me, since good that seemeth in thy sight. Kill me for very righteousness, though none May know the simple meaning of my doom. So thou and thy least word may be at one, Shadow thy victor helm with this dead bloom. O beautiful lightning!âall life's rainbow hues Tone thy brief splendour: thy far purples, Love! Joy's roseate glow. Now, Father! smite: I choose The clear white sword-gleam. Smite as I approve. IPHIGENIA AT AULIS I am Achilles. Thou wast hither brought To be my wife, not for a sacrifice. Greece and her kings may stand aside as nought To what Thou art in my expectant eyes. Or kings or gods. I too am heaven-born. I trample on their auguries and needs. Where the foreboding dares to front my scorn Or break the promise from my heart proceeds? But thou, BelovÃ©d! smilÃ©st down my wrath So able to protect thee. Who should harm Achilles' Bride?âThou pointest to the path Of sacrifice, yet leaning on my arm. There is no need of words; from me reply As little requisite: Thy lightest hand Guideth me, as the helm the ship; Thine eye Doth more than all the AtridÃ¦ could command. Thou givÃ©st life and love for Greece and Right: I will stand by thee lest thou shouldst be weakâ Not weak of soul.âI will but hold in sight Thy marvelous beauty.âHere is She you seek. THE HUNCHBACK God lays his burden on each back: But who What is within the pack May know? All pointed at the Hunchback. He, they said, Was hideous; and their scorn Doubled the anguish which bow'd down his head,â So friendlessly forlorn. Low bow'd his head, even lower than was need, For all his Atlas weight; Bow'd with men's scorn, and with his own sad heed Of what might be the freight 'Neath which so painfully his being creep'd: âWas it a heritage, Growth of his father's sins on him upheap'd? Or his own sinful wage?â Ask'd he of lawgiver and sage and priest, Of all the esteem'd and wise; And gat no answer. Nay! not even the least From worshipp'd Beauty's eyes. Not that they spake not. Some saidâIt was nought, There was no hump at all; And some thatâIt was nothing which he soughtâ The why such did befall; Some laugh'd; and some long visages did pull; Some knew not what he meant; But the BelovÃ©d was so pitiful He cursed her as he went. Some bade him quit vain inquest, and delight Each sense with pleasant things; And some swore 'twas the sign that Heaven would blight His highest imagings; And someâAn operation would remove The mere excrescent flesh; While othersâPruning it would only prove How fast 'twould grow afresh. And some, who cited law and gospel, laid New heaviness on his neck: Let him that hath have ever more, thÃ¨y said, And let the wreck'd bear wreck! Yet after every check, repulse, and scoff, He ask'd again, againâ What is this burthen? Can none take it off? Is there no end of pain? Flung back on his own soul, what he inquired Was hardly, sadly taught; With desperate travail he at length acquired Something of what he sought. He found there was a meaning: that was much: He trusted God was Good:â These thoughts made patience earnest, out of such He earn'd some spirit-food. And grew: for all the evil hump remain'd, Like Sindbad's Man o' the Sea. Only he had no hope to be unchain'd: How from himself get free? At last came Time, who from the chrysalis Brings forth the rainbow'd fly; Of Time he ask'dâWhat was this weight of his? And Time gave full reply. Time mask'd as Death, yet smiling, did unpack The worn man's crushing load: Two wings sprang forth; high o'er the cloudy wrack The Angel, whom men call'd That Poor Hunchback, Through farthest heavens rode. So, looking westward yestereve, I knew A figure of warm cloud: A very humpback till his load he threw, As Lazarus left his shroud. GOD WISH [âPerhaps the notablest Norse God we hear tell of is the God Wunsch or Wish.ââCarlyle's Hero Worship.] God Wish! if one of modern days Might lift to thee a prayer, What form of worship should he raise To claim thy care? Such words as these?âI would have health; I would have strength of limb, With truth at heart, and wisdom's wealth Of eyes ne'er dim; I would be gentle, pure, and fair, As One who loved me pray'd; And bold and firm to do or bear In Virtue's aid; I would have will to prophesy; Brave deeds I would achieve, And on the Future's tapestry Grand tissues weave; My life should journey as a star Tow'rd an eternal aim, And nations worship from afar Its track of flame; I would build up in my own mind A temple unto Truth, And on its shrine an offering bind,â My age and youth; I would have faith of One to whom My faith should be a prize; And love,âif thou couldst ope the tomb Wherein One lies; And children's beauty should bud forth Around the parent stem, And hope behold our scantiest worth Fullgrown in them; I would have means to enrich the poor, And power to uplift the low, And all misfortune's barren moor With blessings sow; And I would win my fellows' love, If love may guerdon zeal That dares their deepest miseries prove To surely heal; And praise should keep my name embalm'd In history's choicest cell, That men might say in years joy-calm'dâ âHe loved us well.ââ Or should I pray in fewer words For virtue, love, and fame? Or ask all joy that earth affords In one loved name?â No answer issues from the North; The Norsemen's potent God Sits signless; Doom no more comes forth To obey his nod. God Wish! have I not pray'd aright? Yet grant, before I die, One lightning-flash athwart the fight, One glimpse of sky.â God Wish!âWhat other God but thou, Under some aspect Greek, Approved his favourites with the vowâ âHave what ye seek!â They chose âwhat best might please the Powersâ Ere morning did return The hope of all their youthful hours Lay in an urn. SONG OF THE STREAMS We leap from the rock's sheer edge, Boisterously: With a shout and hearty laughter Fore and after: Joyously: Slide we over the mossy ledge, Lusciously, Dreaming deliciously: And an eternal roar rolls with us on our way. Clear is the young spring day! The trilling laugh of childish glee And sobs and bubbling mirth are ours 'Mid the wild flowers,â The playful hours racing us through the heath, Down the hill-side racing us out of breath. O'er us the eternal voice rolls on sonorously. An organ thunderâthe dim melody Of many instrumentsâa rushing throng Of men and voices,ânear a charmed song, Solemn afar, even as the voice of God: And heaven is children-trod: Over the many hills the same bright tune Singing to sun and moon; High company upon the hills we had; Were not we glad, Leaping from crag to crag? Leaping from crag to crag; Hiding behind the masses of the rocks; Deem'd from afar to be the shining flocks Of God upon the mountains fed, Everywhere scattered: Now as a silver thread Along the deep ravine The torrent speedeth; and again between The massed rocks, fall after fall, With uproar musical, Bounding from crag to crag, on travel we. Anon our passage free A mountain wall hath stopp'd; And we lie chafing in the fond distress Of way ward pettishness, Boiling with childish rage, Till gentler tones assuage Impetuosity: Still, still hold watch and ward! A postern is unbarr'd: Through the quick gap our damm'd-up waters gush All eagerly: And our high song hath dropp'd Adown the steeps of life, and youthhood's flush Floweth more steadily. Continueth our glee Through the wide meadows, through the long lush grass; Our jocund course between The great grand trees, who in our changeful glass Gaze, as a seer into a depth of dreams: Queenliest trees, proud-form'd, with port serene: And now our many streams Are blending, and the mountain alleys, Merged in one broad road, plunge toward the valleys, While o'er our torrent force the hill-song leaps. And here and there uppeeps Through grassy hair the weird and rugged face Of some grey rock, one of the giant race Of our bleak birth-place, grey as the memories Of an uncultured world, the asperities Of our progressive life: and ever keeps The ancient hill in sight, its head in heaven: And little rustic homelinesses Welcome the mountain-born with flower-wreathing, Bright buttercups, primroses quiet-breathing, Rich-scented chestnut-bloom: And in the torrent's foam The sweet May dips her tresses, Scarcely distinct:âOn, on the waves are driven, As o'er us the old mountain voice still hovers. And every turn discovers New beauty; other streamlets pour, Like other minds their flood of thought, Or other beings influence, brought From many a distance, hour by hour; And the stream swells its volume, and the tide Of power is amplified; And earth is fertilized, field-glories wave, And human dwellings stand on either side: While with melodious stave The river saileth through the busy scene, And o'er it most serene The hill-song, like a heaven-burden, hovers. Now, like two eager lovers, Two fair streams mingle hearts, and our full song Is the quick panting of voluptuous life The harvest fields among, Beneath heaven-arched skies with blithest warblings rife: And our sunn'd face is flush'd even as a bride's: And many a trickling kiss in music glides, Like molten silver bells, our features o'erâ A chorus liquefied of birds and flowers: Such ecstacy is ours. Yet still floats o'er our life the distant roar Of the far mountain hymn:âGod whispers as of old. CHORUSES FROM A POLITICAL POEM 1848 Through thy pain, and through the languor Of despair, and from the anger Of long-disappointed hope, Thou, O Human World! redeeming, The pale phantoms of thy dreaming, Shalt have strength with Time to cope. Though thy weary feet be tender, Though thy lids bear not the splendour Of the Coming of thy Lord, Yet, fond Hope! shalt thou behold him, And thy powerful arms enfold him, And thou know thyself adored. Yet shall Love, O Hope pursuing! On thy heart his life renewing, Speed with thee his tireless flight; And the wake of his star-tresses O'er earth's untrack'd wildernesses Guide Man to the far delight. Lo! I hear the acclamations Of the Faith-awaken'd Nations; And the sweet low-chaunted song Of their organized endeavour: It soars upward ever, ever, On the swift wings, angel-strong. Awake, sad Hope! the tyrants of the earth Are passing like night-shadows: though some clouds Seek to prolong their reign, those lingering shrouds Cradle the Morning in its hour of birth. Ye âDeadâ come forth! Upon the broad firm ground Base ye the templÃ©d round Of human Right, where Men as Gods shall be! O ye Republic Nations! Lay wide the deep foundations Both of your own and Man's Equality!â Uprear the varied columns In their own ample volumes,â Upbear the sacred roof of Country, ye Who know what Freedom meaneth!

The Heaven of sure progression, Whose harmonized expression Is thy perpetual song, Humanity! From the depth of night I have taken flight Into the dawn of a pure delight: And my song upsprings Upon mighty wings To the light of thy smile's imaginings;â Into the Heaven Where Faith was driven When Earth by the winter storm was riven; From the rock and chain Of a hopeless pain Up to thy Heaven I soar again;â From the lowliest grave That Truth dared brave, Seeking even Death, to redeem the Slave; Like an angel's psalm, To the realms of calm, Where Love is heal'd with immortal balm;â To the azure sky Of Faith's visions high Of a serene Eternity,â Where Toil is blest, And where Hope may rest To gaze in the eyes of the Loveliest.

REAL AND TRUE Only the Beautiful is real! All things of which our life is full, All mysteries that life enwreathe, Birth, life, and death, All that we dread or darkly feel,â All are but shadows, and the Beautiful Alone is real. Nothing but Love is true! Earth's many lies, whirl'd upon Time's swift wheel, Shift and repeat their state,â Birth, life, and death, And all that they bequeath Of hope or memory, thus do alternate Continually: Love doth anneal, Doth beauteously imbue, The wine-cups of the archetypal Fate. Love, Truth, and Beauty,âall are one! If life may expiate The wilderings of its dimness, death be known But as the mighty ever-living gate Into the Beautifulâ All things flow on Into one Heart, into one Melody, Eternally. SHADOWS The world goes round and the rain is falling: Welladay! The world goes round and the rain is falling; Ever the Shadowy Ones are callingâ Come away! The world goes round and the leaves are falling Every day. The world goes round and the leaves are falling; Autumn weeds are the Spring forestalling;â Earth is grey. The world goes round and Death is callingâ Come away! The world goes round and Death is calling, Hour by hour, poor Life appalling. Welladay! The world goes round and the stars are falling, Welladay! The world goes round and the stars are falling: All things, God! unto thee, are callingâ Be our stay! DEATH O welcome, Death! Long have I sought thee thorough trials many; Long, long, and tempted would not be of any: Most welcome Death! Thy foes, O Death! Wisdom and Fame, woo'd me; to my pale lips Fond Beauty clungâa cloud too thin to eclipse The mooned Death. O trusty Death! Wisdom with cold sneer mocks thy prophecies; And Glory would outbid thy promises: Yet welcome, Death! All hate thee, Death! Have not I reason? thou hast stolen away The sunshine of my being:âmy sole stay Art thou, O Death! O gentle Death! Ill things are said of thee: that thou dost rend The loving hearts, and mocking ever blend Foul dust with breath. BelovÃ©d Death! Men call thee Pain, and say that thou dost fasten Thy fangs in the heart of Joy: and yet all hasten To the arms of Death. Impassion'd Death! All lovely things pillow them on thy breast: What seek they? surer dreams than life, or rest? Serenest Death! O silent Death! What joy in thy dream-circled home abideth? Over the moon-lit face a calm smile glideth. O silent Death! A FUNERAL HYMN Why are your spirits sad? Why is't ye weep, When the Weak and Pain-wearied Are bosom'd in sleep? Hush! lest ye vex the Tired with your rude cries: In the calm home of Death there are no agonies. Why do ye weep? Why are your hearts unstrung? Why are ye dull? Though our Lost was so young, And is beautiful. Whom God best loveth he first calleth home: Wouldst thou detain the summon'd through long years to roam, To toil and weep? Why mourn ye thanklessly? Toil needeth rest,â Pain asketh remedy,â âFriends! death is best.â Better to strew his pillow with green praise Than pile on his sere heart the snow of evil days! Then ye might weep. Mourn not what we have lost! What hath he won? Love ever smileth most. Where he is gone, There shall we follow. Joy that he hath gain'd God's blessed peace so soon, that he is first unchain'd. How can ye weep? Why are your spirits sad? He is at rest. O, be ye calmly glad! Wrong not the Blest! What though we see him not, though life is dim? Hope sits with us in the shade, bearing one wish from himâ âFriends! do not weep!â A DIRGE âSWEETS TO THE SWEET!â Nightingale! sing o'er her tomb; Forest-flowers! bend o'er her: Song to song, and bloom to bloom: God's wide universe the dome Wherein we adore her. Let our lives sing o'er her tomb, True thoughts blossom o'er her! Song to song, and bloom to bloom: God smiles through the narrow room, White wings float before her. Soul of song! thou hast no tomb; God's own bosom wore her: Song of song and Bloom of bloom!â Weep not! in the Blessed Doom God's love watcheth o'er her. NIGHT-MUSIC O nightingale! why singest thou in May, Amid the tender leaves, Unto the crescent moon, in the twilight grey Of sultry eves? Kissing the pale-brow'd Night with thy low moan, When the written song o' the sun is blotted out and gone. O Nightingale! why singest to the moon, The full-orb'd moon of May? Pouring the fragrance of that pining tune Upon the feet of Day; Ever from vesper time to near the morn Trilling thy sweetest plaint, thou ecstasy forlorn! O Nightingale! O life so sweetly sad! Singing 'mid yellow buds that may not leaf; O soul of song! whose noble music had Borrow'd its dearest eloquence from grief:â O thou broad-fronted Heaven, with thy clear eyes, Solve the sad quest of these melodious agonies! OLD FRIENDS The old old friends! Some changed; some buried; some gone out of sight; Some enemies, and in this world's swift fight No time to make amends. The old old friendsâ Where are they? Three are lying in one grave; And one from the far-off world on the daily wave No loving message sends. The old dear friends! One passes daily; and one wears a mask; Another long estranged cares not to ask Where causeless anger ends. The dear old friends, So many and so fond in days of youth! Alas that Faith can be divorced from Truth, When love in severance ends. The old old friends! They hover round me still in evening shades: Surely they shall return when sunlight fades, And life on God depends. THE DIRGE OF LOVE Strew flowers, for Love is dead! Flowers with the Morning's tears upon them shed. Drop them in Love's lone grave, By Sorrow's ceaseless wave. For Love is dead! Not flowers!âor take the crown Hope in her desperate agony flung down! Unweave each wither'd stem; And idly scatter them Where Love lies dead! No flowers, but grey moss'd stones! Or greyer yet, from heights the lichen owns! Pile them on Love's lone grave, By Sorrow's moaning wave. Now Love is dead! Fair flowers! ye bloom no more. Grey mountain summits! ye are clouded o'er. Lay neither stones nor flowers, But only woeful hours, Where Love lies dead! Not flowers! but tears instead! Love was the flower of lifeâand Love is dead. Pile up no record stones! For Sorrow ever moans Where Love lies dead. NOUGHT Hope and fear are nought to me,â Even despair outwears its sting; Fear is whelm'd in certainty,â Hope, far from me wandering, Rests where Love may be: Sorrow sleepeth at my side, Like the veil'd corse of a bride,â Ever calmly smileth she: Earthly hope is not for me.â Woe is me! Hope and fear are nought to me, Throned o'er Time and Circumstance In desolation's majesty; Evil-tiding and Mischance Dare not look on Me. O'er the world the pilgrim fareth; To the grave Love's cross he beareth: Pity clingeth tearfully. Hope and fear are nought to me: Woe is me! HOPE Poor hope sate on a grave, a very child, Blowing her rainbow bubbles; as she cast Each one in the air, it broke. Yet still she smiled Upon the latest one. âLook! this will last.â GONE Will the dead Hours come again, From the arms of the buried Years? Though we call, we call in vain, And they will not heed our tears. Why, O why were they slain By thy fears? Will the dead Love e'er return, For all thy late desire? Can thy grief unclose Love's urn, Or make of the ashesâfire; Though the cinders yet may burn Round the pyre? Alas and alas for the Gone! We mourn and we mourn in vain. Like a ghost, or the dreamy tone Of some long-forgotten strain, Their memory haunts the Lone But with pain. TO THE WEST WIND O sweet West Wind! thou breathÃ©st on my brow: O dear West Wind! thou comÃ©st from my home. O heedless Wind! had I been free as thou To stay or go, I had not cared to roam. O glad West Wind! what bringest thou from Her? Thy breath is fragrant with her plaint to thee. What message hast thou from the weary stir Of that lone heart which ever beats for me? O happy Wind! love-laden with her sighs: What dreamy kisses layest thou on my brow? O sad West Wind!âsad, sad, and most unwise: A fugitive like meâan exile now. LITERÃ SCRIPTÃ Words, loving words, since kisses can not be! Words, passionate words that echo past delight! O Love! whose sun is absent, give to me Some starry memories to cheat my night! Words, loving words! repeat that thou art mine! Words, burning words! to warm my heart so cold, Iced in this polar distance, where I pine For summer and its splendours manifold. Words, fiery words! a pentecost of flame: Words, tonguÃ©d fire! to comfort my despair: Crowning my brow with every passion'd name,â Electric sparks from Phoibos' golden hair. Words, star-like words! each word a globe of fire! My Sun-god hath departed: life is dim. Words! words! a heaven of stars!âO fond Desire! The starriest night is darkness, wanting Him. FALSE HOPE God save me from mine enemy! I pray we ne'er may meet again. She has been worse than foe to me: And yet, if we should meet again I should believe her, to my bane. She has been worse than foe to me, With promised love and present pain, Till love seem'd only injury, And troth was known to be in vain: I did believe her, to my bane. Her clear eyes look'd so lovingly, 'She clung with such a hearty strain, Her lipsâO God! so sweet to meâ Left upon mine a poison blain: I did believe her, to my bane. She has been worse than foe to me: Yet I should love her o'er again If we should meetâdear Injury! Men call her Hope,âbut she is Pain. Pray God we may not meet again. VAIN COUNSEL Cease to love! since all thy wooing Can not win her, cease pursuing! Cease thy loving all so gainless! Cease, since love can not be painless! Love not to thine own undoing! Cease to love love so uncaring! Cease a love she is not sharing! Cease to love whose love is fickle! Fling aside thy broken sickle! Why should one reap but despairing? Cease rejected vows to tender! Cease! thy worthless hope surrender! Cease to love!âBut words are idle. Will could never yet Love bridle: Love struck mad with loving splendour. FOOT-PRINTS There are days of our lives that lie on the past Like the prints of bleeding feet: But the heart's wayfaring records last, Though Hope and Joy may meet. Never effaced by the summer rain, Those marks must aye remain. Look not back, thou Unhappy One! For the blood will blind thine eyes; Look not down on thy feet; begone From the track of agonies. Leave to the past the things of the past: For, alas! those marks must last. TO HIS LOVE WHO HAD UNJUSTLY REBUKED HIM Gentle as Truth, and zealous even as Loveâ Which is the fiercest of all earthly things; Frank, and yet using caution as a glove To guard the skin from foulnesses or stings,â Giving the bare hand surely to the true: Such would I be, to make me worthy you. Bitter sometimes, as wholesome tonics are; Wrathful as Justice in her earnest mood; Scornful as Honour is, yet not to bar Appreciation of the lowest good; Loathing the vile, the cruel, the untrue: How should my manhood else be worthy you? Say I am subtil, fierce, and bitter-tongued: Love is all this, and yet Love is beloved. But say not that I wilfully have wrong'd Even those whose hate and falsehood I have proved. Who say this know me not, and never knew What I would be, but to be worthy you. BEGINNINGS A small small seed, and of no account,â 'Twas a chance if it would grow: In a deep rock crevice a hidden fount,â Mere drops, too few to flow. Now the seed is a spreading upas tree, No joy can live beneath: And that fount has flooded love's pleasant lea With the dark deep tide of death. LOVE'S TALISMAN Thou say'stââWill thy love last?â Look through the years; Behold where Change still sleepeth with the dust On his closed eye-lids. Let not thy vain fears A waken him! Love's talisman is trust. THE WOUNDED KNIGHT Let me rest! the fight is over; I am smitten unto death. Leave me! I shall be unwounded by the worst the foeman saith: Foeman's taunts no more can move him whom his friend dishonoureth. O, 'tis thou hast struck my spirit, stabb'd me in the thickest fight With thy doubt most false and cruel: thou and I had else such might, That all odds had fallen before us, strong in brotherhood and right. Thou didst hold thy shield before me; when my sword-point as of old Cover'd thee, thou lookedst on me with a smile so scornful cold, SayingââHenceforth I will guard me with an arm that is not sold.â Thou spakest plainly, roundly chargedst me with a treason unconceived; Badest me turn my sword against thee, only so to be believed; Smotest me with a vile suspicion never more to be retrieved. So I fell, fell fighting madly, without thee to shield my life; All unused to fight dishonour'd, rushing blindly to the strife: So fell, stabb'd to the heart,âO friendliest! stabb'd, and by no foeman's knife. Leave me now! thy pity hurts me. Thou wilt think that thou wert wrong: Thou wilt think?âO, henceforth rest thee in thy false assurance strong: No such wound be thine as speeds me this dark flood of grief along! Yet, true friend! thou didst not falsely, thou by treacherous words beguiled. Closer! thy true tears fall on me! closer!âmy words too were wild: My death-smile would whisper to theeâhow our love is reconciled. TEARS Weep! weep bitter tears! for thy friends Are the Dead and the Overthrown And the Sacrificed: God lends Such help to the Lone. Weep! weep bitter tears! for thy friends Are the Friendless: what art thou? How silently each yellow leaf wends From the wither'd bough. Weep desperate tears! in the tomb Build thy palace brave! A sure friend and a certain home There alone thou may'st have. WATCHING O I am weary, watching for thy coming,â And yet thou comÃ©st not; Day after day my weary feet are roaming To that dear spot Where thou didst bless me with those words so vainâ âWe soon shall meet again.â My soul is worn with prayer for thy returning, And yet thou dost not come; All through the long long night the lamp is burning In thy lone home,â Thy home, my heart, where echo yet in vain Thy wordsââWe meet again.â A ROMANCE âO sister! leave your broidery-frame; Come to the window, Dear! Be quick: I hear them shout his name; The music draweth near.ââ She leaneth o'er her broidery-frame, Her tears are dropping fast; She heedeth not the glad acclaim, Nor the triumph thronging past. âO Sister! look,â how grand they ride; Come to the window, Sweet! Be quick: the king is at his side, They're coming down the street.ââ She leaneth o'er her broidery-frame, Her tears are dropping fast; She heedeth not the pomp of fame, Nor the banners flaunting past. âThe sun smiles on their blazonry: Come, Dear! or they'll be gone. Be quickâhis eyes are seeking me,â My own Victorious One!ââ She lifts her brow; 'tis flush'd with shame; âHe was my wooer last.â She lieth dead by her broidery-frame, Ere the knight hath ridden past. PARTING (From the French) Not a penny left, and you know in such a case You have but to leave me, Darling! andâit's easy to forget. One kiss, one look again into your bonny face, And we part, we part for everâBut your eyes are wet. It is nought, dear! we have pass'd a many happy days, To say nothing of our nights; but days and nights are past. Could they have been more lastingâBut the proverb soothly saysâ The very best of joys are those which may not last. VALENTINE'S DAY Some young urchin, shamming lonely, Writes on âgilt-edged superfineâ To some unknown charmer, onlyâ âBe thou, Darling! ever mineâ Draws a heart, with arrow-skewer,â âSo Love hath transfix'd me thine.â Never recipe was truer For a perfect Valentine. Birds are billing, birds are cooing; All things lovely go in pairs: We are willing, why not wooing, When sweet Spring comes unawares? Very cold though is this spring-time, Snow on every tiny spray; Better wait some happier ring-time: Valentine! put off thy day. Ho, Saint Valentine so simple, Sadly simple Valentine, All so earnest for a dimple And a smile that meets not thine! Gentle Love! do not deceive me: Is thy heart quite throughly mine, And the arrow barb'd? Believe me Thine own faithful Valentine. MIND YOUR KNITTING (After BÃ©ranger) Lucy! mind your knitting: Blind as I may be, I am certain you're not sitting At your work by me.â â'Tis so hot this April weather.ââ Is it cooler where You and Robert sit together? You are idling there. Lucy! mind your knitting. Lucy! mind your knitting: You have left your seat. Tell me where again you're flitting: Those are not your feet.â â'Tis the cat that you hear moving.ââ You speak false to me: I'd like Robert better loving You more openly. Lucy! mind your knitting. Lucy! mind your knitting; Lucy! have a fear: Some day Robert will be quittingâ Ah! she does not hear. These young folk will still be scorning All we old folk say; They will never heed our warning While their playmates stay. Lucy! mind your knitting. TWO FABLES POT AND KETTLE âWipe out that black stain, naughty Sister Pot!â âYou're just as foul, Dame Kettle!â Pot replied. 'Twas nicely mean'd by each. And yet, God wot, Some scouring had done more on either side. PLATE AND JUG Says PlateââYou are narrow and thin; And, poor Jug! I abominate that.â Jug repliesââYou may call it a sin: But, my dear! I'm not shallow and flat.â MAIDEN WISDOM It is so hard to keep my lover in his sorrow, When, O Love! this very moment I would pine to make him blest. O wisest Mother! tell me, wherefore say To-morrow, When there on the threshold waits my heart's expected guest? Tell me, dear Mother! tell me, wherefore test him with denial, When I know that he is true, for I would give him life or death? Is there need to prove his honour? Is there any need of trial When he tells me that he loves me and I listen with rapt breath? When I answer, as you bade me, that he had best be waiting Till proofs of love's reality and persistence can be had, Then he laughing saysââThe birds are less cautious in their matingâ Or his eyelids droop so sadly that my darken'd heart is sad. Be sure he's earnest, Mother! very true and pure and loving; Could you see his heart as I do, you would say I might be sure: And he looks, O so imploringly,âEven is there need of proving, I would rather sayâDear Lover! I can trust you to endure. WINE SONG Let the purple wine o'erbrim the golden beaker, Pouring o'er the Bacchants richly sculptured there; Never cease thy song-stream, eloquentest speaker! Ne'er, till all believe, thy sweet discoursing spare. Quickly pour the wine from out the fruit-lipp'd beaker; Whisper to us, Bacchus! how this life is fair; Speak out roundly, Wine-god! fortunatest seeker! Thou most true bliss-finder! tell us how and where. Let again the flood o'erbrim the perfect beaker; Lift our hearts, Ascender! make our lives thy care; Yet, yet once more blessâThy voice is growing weakerâ Bless us with those ripe lips, on this heaven-stair. WHAT I HATE I hate cant, And I hate a âplant,â And humbug I hate altogether; And I hate a lie, And treachery, Worse than the foulest weather. And as much as I can Ever hate a man, I hate one with a voice unpleasant, With a mouth most greedy And an eye unsteady: Him I hate, as a snare the pheasant. I hate rich fools, And I hate sham schools, And I hate the pretence of passion; And I hate foul words, And swine and swineherds, Though Pork be the height of the fashion. I hate weak rhymesâ Though I use them at times; And I hate all the baseness of evil; And I hate some things more Even worse than a bore,â And a bore I hate worse than the Devil. TRIADS Three things that are gone for ever WhÃ©n once they have pass'd away: A man's and a woman's honour And the life of Yesterday! The last in our dreams returnethâ Though the wakening doubles pain; But, however the sad heart yearneth, Lost honour is sought in vain. Two things that can never be mended By penance or prayer or power: The trust in a broken promise, The growth of a sever'd flower! And a third that is yet more tenderâ The hope of our trustful years: Like the autumn's morning splendour, Goneâgone in a waste of tears. Three more should endure for ever: The strength of a heavenward song, The heart of a brave endeavour, The pardon that meeteth wrong! And three should be ever exhaustlessâ Ay! four,âthough the heavens depart: True effort and faith and mercy And the love of a loving heart. SWEET GALE The sweet South Wind once underground was frozen, And only growth to save her could avail. She grew up through a plant; the plant so chosen We call in our North Country the Sweet Gale. AN HOUR OF ROBIN HOOD O for an hour with Robin Hood, deep, deep in the forest green, With fern and budding bramble waving o'er me as a screen, In mid noon shade, Where the hot-breath'd Trade Came never the boughs between. O for an hour of Robin Hood, and the brave health of the free, Out of the noisome smoke to where the earth breathes fragrantly, Where heaven is seen, And the smile serene Of heavenliest liberty. O for the life of Robin Hood, to wander an outlaw free Rather than crawl in the market-place of human slavery: Better with men In the wildest glen, Than palaced with Infamy. My life for a breath of Robin Hood, with the arrow before my eye And a tyrant but within bow-shot reach: how gladly could I die With the fame of Tell, With Robin so well Embalm'd in history. O but to rest, like Robin Hood, beneath some forestgreen, Where the wild-flowers of the coming spring on my mouldering heart may lean; For England's sward Is trampled hard With the journeyings of the Mean. THE SONG OF THE PAUPER Spring cometh to the world; Spring cometh not to me: There is no Spring in the poor-house yard, For the prison'd Misery. The fond Spring whispereth: The merry birds are singing; The chime o' the flowers is ringing:â But mine is prison breath. Spring shouteth jubilee: The pauper may not fare From the closeness of his winter ward Into the fragrant air. Spring loosens the frozen earth; The forests their free arms are flinging Abroad: to me are clinging Death and the rule of dearth. Spring smileth: the free birds mate; The free flower blossometh:â The home of the pauper is desolate; The grave-weed is his wreath. There is no smile for me; No child to my life is clinging; Though the buds on the moors are springing, I have no family. Spring cometh to the world; Spring giveth life to all: O, when shall the Spring of poor Human-kind Proclaim its festival? The fond Spring whispereth: The merry birds are singing; The chime o' the flowers is ringing:â But mine is prison breath. RICH AND POOR In the softly carpeted and richly furnish'd room Young life hath enjoyment, as a flower its bloom; Broidering some pretty toy the dainty fingers ply An easy task, 'mid pleasant hours, in very luxury. On the bare floor, in the attic, where cold winds drive through, Young life withers sadly, wanting all its due; Broidering some gorgeous robe for wealthy dame to wear, Slowly weary fingers labour,âpleasure smiles not there. In the mansion child and maiden know all life's delight; Child and maiden homed with Squalor live in sorry plight. Yet the mansion and the hovel are not far apart; Under rags or satin beats the human heart; And the child, on floor or carpet, hopes, desires, and fears; And the rich lass than the poorest hath no pearlier tears. Tell your children that God made them brethren, sisters, all, Born in even a manger or baronial hall; Teach them what the Poor Man taught the rich long time ago, How all of us are God's children, be we ne'er so low. Little children! learn the lesson: wheresoe'er you be, Love and loving help each other, truly, tenderly. UNSEEN WORTH A single drop of rain fell from the skies: None saw it, on that day so bright and fair. It slid into the ground, and nourish'd there The acorn of an oak to live for centuries. THE PALACE Ill-built, dim-window'd, many a broken tile,â A king dwells here, kings are his visitors. Which is the palace? This? or yonder pile Where crowned Meanness hides, past all its golden doors? NATURE'S GENTLEMAN (To James Watson) He boasts nor wealth nor high descent, yet he may claim to be A gentleman to match the best of any pedigree: His blood hath run in peasant veins through many a noteless year; Yet, search in every prince's court, you'll rarely find his peer. For he's one of Nature's Gentlemen, the best of every time. He owns no mansion in the Square, inherits no estate; He hath no stud, no hounds, no duns, no lacqueys at his gate; He drinks no wine, and wears no gloves, his coat is thread-bare worn: Yet he's a gentleman no less, and he was gentle born. He is one of Nature's Gentlemen, the best of every time. His manners are not polish'd, he has never learn'd to bow: But his heart is gentle,âgentle manner out of it doth grow, Like a flower whose fragrance blesseth all within its beauteous reach, Or the dainty bloom upon a plum, or the softness of a peach. For he's one of Nature's gentle ones, the best of every time. He takes small pains to smoothe his words to fit a courtly phrase; And he would scorn to file his soul for even royal praise; And he has wrath too when the proud the gentlesoul'd distress: He's not the formâgentility, but very gentleness. Ay! one of Nature's gentle men, the best of every time. As true old Chaucer sang to us, so many years ago, He is the gentlest man who dares the gentlest deeds to do: However rude his birth or state, however low his place, He is the gentle man whose life right gentle thought doth grace. He is one of Nature's Gentlemen, the best of every time. What though his hand is hard and rough with years of honest pains,â Who ever thought the knight disgraced by honour's weather-stains? What though no Heralds' College in their books his line can trace,â We can see that he is gentle by the smile upon his face. For he's one of Nature's Gentlemen, the best of every time. PRAYER Let us pray! Our prayer be truthful! Fervent and effectual thought Is a spirit strong and youthful, Whose desire in deed is wrought. Let us pray! Let us pray! Our hope be daring! Prayer is an eternal seed,â Germ of will, and sure of bearing Energetic, zealous deed. Let us pray! Let us pray! And prayer is action: Prayer! thou art a hero-sword. Rive the battle; make no paction Until Victory own thee lord! Let us pray! Let us pray! as prays the sower,â Pray we as the soldier prays! Though our harvest may be slower, Though in heaven we reap the bays. Let us pray! TRIUMPH Work can never miss its wages. One wide song rings through the ages: Ever loss true gain presages. Not alone that flowers are blowing Over graves,âthat bread is growing In warm tears from heaven flowing,â That old Winter Spring-seed hiveth; Ever Death Creation wiveth, And God's Love the tempest driveth. Let the conqueror blush for winning! Little worth his conquest-sinning: They who lose are so beginning. Through the years one chorus ringeth: The death-chaunt the martyr singeth Is the root whence victory springeth. In the Desert sink the Weary,â Dry their pitcher; angels near ye,â Ishmael! Arab empires hear thee. Joseph by his brethren barter'd Hath his full revenge: the Martyr'd Egypt ruled and Israel charter'd. Round the ark the river gushes,â All is lost; amid the rushes Pharaoh's Daughter, dawn-like, blushes. Calvary's complete surrender Is of utmost conquest tender, And its gloom intensest splendour. What though Ruin cometh faster, Look thou God-ward through disaster: âIn this sign thou shalt be master!â Ever hangs 'twixt earth and heaven Victory's Victor, unforgiven, Crown'd with thorn and earthquake-riven. Ever the same chorus ringeth: From his cross the martyr flingeth Wide the seed whence victory springeth. Ever through the book of ages. The same echoes close the pages: Ever loss true gain presages. AFTER A DEFEAT Yet we labour, ever hoping, Though misfortune mocks endeavour; Down disaster's desperate sloping Yet we struggle, hoping ever,â Wearily. Even as the stream is flowing To the sea with ceaseless motion, Never wave its current knowing, Pass our lives to sorrow's ocean, Ceaselessly. Weep'st thou, Hope! unhappy mother, O'er thy dead child, Misery? Let us sit by one another, And our moan shall echo thee Drearily. Yet, though Hope herself be dying In despite of Love and Glory, Our crush'd lives beside her lying Should maintain the same high story, Steadfastly. Yet, O Hope! thy ghost shall lead us Through the graves of Time's commotion, Till the Eternal Watchers heed us, Till they give to our devotion Victory. THE PEARL But one of God's good angels hast thou known: Disease. And would'st thou treat him like a churl? Be wise and thankful! From disease is grown The Pearl. SAD QUESTIONING Why is it so? O God! The old old cry: As in impatient youth, So now, our years gone by, When thy afflictive rod Would teach us truth. Why is it so? O Power! The rocks are bare With wasting streams; our lives Are wasted by despair: In some far vale the flower Of the future thrives. Why is it so? O God! The old vain cry That asketh thee to spare. What is it that we die? Green sod and then green sod Thy way prepare. MIDWINTER Midwinter comes to-morrow, My welcome guest to be: White-hair'd, wide-winged Sorrow, With Christmas gifts for me. Thy angel, God!âI thank thee still. Thy will be doneâThy better will! I thank thee, Lord!âthe whiteness Of winter on my heart Shall keep some glint of brightness, Till sun and stars depart. Thou smilÃ©st on the snow: Thy will Is dread and drear, but lovely still. GAUDIAMUS IGITUR Ay! the road is very lonesome, very rugged, very steep: See yon cheerful flowers before us, While the summer sun high o'er us His bright way doth keep: Gaudiamus igitur! In the fierce noon fades the flower; now the storm bursts overhead: Look, how beautiful the lightning,â Like some proud life's courage brightening In the depths of dread: Gaudiamus igitur! Starless night, the worn wayfarer ploddeth on through sleety rain: Has thy soul no starry glory? Was the lamp of hero story Given thee in vain? Gaudiamus igitur! Thou art poor, and joy is costly; simplest happiness so dear: What's a brave smile's market value? What laugh-dealer may forestall you? Never stint thy cheer! Gaudiamus igitur! At the death-bed of thy brother, over the belovÃ©d tomb: Grief by memory's flash be riven! Look on Love star-throned in heaven! Joy again hath room: Gaudiamus igitur! TIME'S GIFTS Time hath two blessings for mankind: the first Is earthly joy; He gives the second even to the most accurst,â Rest from annoy. CHANGE O'er the hills another dawn advances; Yesterday is past. Is Past untrue? The grave-stones of its changes and its chances Are the triumphal pavement of the New. And To-day toward the western billows Passeth even as Yesterday did pass. Morrow morns will smile on human pillows; Morrow evenings gild the churchyard grass. Yet Life overliveth tides and chances; Yet Truth groweth stronger and more true; Reverence shrines the Old, while Faith advances Ever on and on from New to New. SELF-JUSTIFICATION Satan was not the Devil because he fell, But for his pride in fallingâwhen he said Evil! be thou my good: to err is well. Self-justification is his devilhead. THE ADVENT OF PEACE Over the red field strode an armed knight: Men knew him not; but when the fray did cease, God's Angel stoop'd to bless Victorious Right, And bade the hero's name thenceforth be Peace. NARROWNESS You complain that I am narrowâ Going straightly to my aim: Will you quarrel with the arrow For the same? Many a bitter name hast thou,â âPedant,â âbigotâ: hold thy blame While that sword and nail and plough Are the same. I would cleave my world-path cleanlyâ With an axe', a razor' edge; Drive my truth through,ânot more meanly Than a wedge. Far is wide, though force is narrow: Look straight to thy aim! Crystal, bud, and flame, and arrow, Are the same. LOVE âLove gives soul and strength to woman, stronger man hath Will instead; Love could but degrade him earth ward, so let Genius live unwed:â Words like these, my brow quick flushing, 'neath a subtil myth I read. Love! who wrote these words had never known the lover's conscious might, Nor true passion whose proud soaring climbeth the divinest height, Nor the holiest uplifting of Love's eloquent delight. Yet thy prophet eyes are on me; and the splendour of thy smile, Like the dawn from some high mountain reaching over many an isle To the eternal verge of ocean, leads my spirit as ere while. I can answer from Thy teaching:âLove is Genius' only ark; Will is but a blinded athlete, straining God-ward in the dark, Without Love to point endeavour, like an arrow to its mark. Say that love of the unworthy doth degrade to lower needs; Thou art but misusing language. Love from Beauty aye proceeds; Love is Worship of the Worthy, can have no unworthy heeds. Matters not or man or woman. Love of Beauty, like a flame, Ever heaven ward aspireth,âthere is no diviner aim; Faith, Devotion to the EternalâLove and these are still the same. Be it of the Divine or Human, Love pursueth one emprizeâ One, whate'er the priest, the altar, or the form of sacrifice: Truth is none the less resplendent beaming from a woman's eyes. Never may the world be ransom'd till this Word be understood: Love is Genius' strength and conscience; Love is Will's sustaining food, And his guide across the desert, and his crown upon the rood. Love is holiest gospel ever.âThy pale beauty, like a star, Lights me to the steps of glory where the restless angels are: As thy radiance, Mother Blessed! led the Magi from afar. TWO STORIES OF ONE FATE 1 Take him,âlove him, Sister!âlove him dearly for my sake. If your love should ever fail him, O be sure my heart would break. It is not breaking now,âbelieve me! though my tears rain down so fast: You shall soon have sunshine through them of a joy that aye will last. Yes, indeed I love him dearly. Could I help it? Sister mine! Who could refuse to love him, so lovely, so divine? I will not blush for sayingâI did yearn for love of him. Is my cheek still burning? dear one! But my eyes no more are dim. I do, do love him. Never I deny that holy love. I love him more than life and joy, all selfish hope above. That I love him is my reason, dear! for laying on your heart My Darling,âsince I found his life was of your life a part. You will love him as I love him; with a love too past my might,â For I know through all his silentness your love is his delight. Love's eyes are very keen, Love's heart has little need of words: And I can read your heart and his and all their sweet accords. Love him, love him dearly, Sister! life hath not too many days. Why these tears? And I am smiling. For my glad heart fills with praise To God, who gives us love's best blessing,âto assure the Loved One's blissâ I with my soul's devotedness, and thouâwith thy life-kiss. 2 Thy hand, my friend! I claim again the brother's trusting hand: Though if you dared to call her yours I'd slay you where you stand. She is not yours, nor mine; but we are wholly, humbly hers, Her knights, her lieges, her true friends, her trusty servitors. Thou canst not love her more than I. Is this the only right, For life and death I grapple thee, and mock thy utmost might. Take all the odds of honour that my love of thee e'er gave, I'd overstride thee, wast thou king and I Love's meanest slave. Thou canst not love her more than I. It is no claim at all. Her own will is our only law, whatever may befall. Till then upon this worthy field against thee I contendâ Hath she spoken so? God help me! I will not be false, my friend! And look that thou be loyal, for I love her none the less; See that thy very nobleness her every hope may bless. Shouldst thou fail her in one tittleâGrasp me firmly! Words are vain. She loves thee: who could fail upon the very heart of gain? And thou wilt let me love her still, in duteous, lowly guise: Watching before thy happy gate, lest evil may surprize: Asking no wages but thy trust, and one approving glance From eyesâdear eyes!âThy hand, great friend! I bless thy happy chance. A HOMILY Why hath God led thy noble beauty hither? To lay upon my heart, a gather'd flower, Through the brief time of passion; then to wither, And drop away upon my coffin'd hour? Is human life nought but a lusty living, A day of pleasure nighted by the grave, With no hereafter dawning, no forgiving Of all the eternal hopes our spirits crave? Is love the mere lamp of a wanton chamber, Whose walls are grave-stones, ne'er so finely hid? Is all the height where Love and Hope can clamber, Alas! no higher than our coffin-lid? Is Love a fool for all its future-yearning? Wise only in the drunkenness of bliss? Is there no flame divine within us burning? Is Hope betray'd so cheaply with a kiss? Why hath God led thy noble beauty hither? Why doth celestial light inform thine eyes? Is it to guide the lone wayfarer? Whither? The Star of the East hangs not o'er Paradise. Some girl with delicate skin and golden tresses, And eyes that float in their voluptuous light, Holding her boy-adorer in the jesses Of her caprice, staying his spirit's flight, Smoothing his folded pinions with light fingers, Kissing his vigour to a pleasant swoon, Until the God sunk in the Dreamer lingers Fondly beside her for the frailest boon,â Is this the highest end of all thy beauty? O noble woman! art thou but a girl? Hast thou no thought of all the scope of duty? No aim beyond the fingering of a curl? Why hath God made thee beautiful and loving? Only to bear the bacchanal cup of life? Cup-bearing Hebe! seek thou Jove's approving: O Beauty! be thou Strength's diviner wife. WHAT LOVE IS Thou bidd'st me tell thee what love really is. Not the mere toying of a boy and girl,â She kissing his fair brow, and he a curl: Love is not this. Thou bidd'st me tell thee what love really is. Not the mere mingling of most passionate breath: There are who have the Loved to very death, And yet love miss. Thou bidd'st me tell thee what love really is. Not hope nor having: whoso love forget Love's joy in their great taskâto pay love's debt,â Not paid with a kiss. How shall I tell thee what love really is? O Love! thy merest trifle is delight; And passion's hell or heaven is infinite In bale or bliss. How shall I tell thee what love really is? O Perfect Beauty! let my worship be The happiest bloom of thy eternity. True love is this. LOVE'S TRINITY Justice, Love, and Faith are one: Love resumeth all the three: Justiceâlove for what is done,â Loveâthe present royalty,â Faithâthe love of what shall be. Justice vindicates the Past: Keeps its truth from dying with The formal life that could not last; Still maintains the central pith And the essence of the myth. Faith is Love of the Unseen, Of the Future beyond sight: Faith, above the sky serene Of present Love, with tireless flight Cleaves the clouded Infinite. Love is Truth and Faith in one,â Love is life's true harmony: There was Truth in what is gone, Though it seem not; there shall be New Truth to eternity. Justice, Love, and Faith, are Oneâ Love, the perfect Trinity: Love is just to what is gone; Love, aye present unto Thee, Trusteth to futurity. MARRIED O life, O destiny complete! The sunder'd halves come home again. So long, so long the yearning twain Have sought each other: now they meet. We will not say again our lives: It is one life henceforth for aye. Though we may wander far away, It is one soul that hopes and strives. It is one soul our life informs,â It is one life that we shall lead,â One hope is ours, one will, one creed: Ye can not part us, all ye storms! My life is not where I may be: Only a part, removed from her. We never can be as we wereâ Two lives,âbut one: for I am She. And She and I are one brave whole. The soul's two halves for once unite. For once: through all the Infinite! For once: until the farthest goal. POETS 1 Poets!âWe are too many. But not oneâ Not one of the whole pack deserves the name. This with his fool-bells plays a jingling game; That mildly mouths a most mellifluous moan; A third can fashion heroes without bone; A fourth flings words like firebrands, without aim; A fifthâperhaps a sixthâHow many grand Pretentious versifiers, rhymesters, âbardsâ! But none whose venturous eyes dare look towards The world's great future; never one whose brand May sear the actual wrong; not one to stand Upon that height the Unprophetic guards. True Poet, with the soul and sword of flame, Come forth, and for our soul-less words atone! 2 True poet!âBack, thou Dreamer! Lay thy dreams In ladies' laps. And silly girls delight With thy inane apostrophes to Night, Moonshine, and Wave, and Cloud! Thy fancy teems; Not genius. Else some high heroic themes Should from thy brain proceed, as Wisdom's Might From head of Zeus. For now great Wrong and Right Affront each other, and War's trumpet screams, Giddying the earth with dissonance. O where Is He voiced god-like, unto those who dare To give more daring with the earnest shout Of a true battle-hymn? We fight without The music which should cheer us in our fight,â While âpoetsâ learn to pipe like whiffling streams. THE POET-PROPHET The poet is the Prophet. His the task To herald Truth yet far from common sight, The germs of the world's work to bring to light, To lift the resurrection-hope from hell. Song is a Gospel. Whose doth but bask In poet-glory, who thrusts not the might Of Wisdom's spear before the ages' fight, Is not the Poetâsing he ne'er so well. The Poet is the Prophet. Would'st thou clip Isaiah's wings, and mew him in a cageâ A singing birdâmy Lady Lazy's pageâ To soothe dull ears with some luxurious rhyme? He stands before God's altar; his grand lip Hath kiss'd the living coal; the prophet-rage Burneth his heartâand on our darken'd age Bursts forth, a lava flood of hopes sublime. The poet is the seÃ«r, and sayer too: Prophet and soothsayer of all mankind. What thoughâlike the Song-Titan, Homerâblind, And with no conscience of the future growth, He sings of Troy the Past? Yet Troy the New Comes on the echo. Is the tempest-wind Fraught but with battle-shouts? Some tones thou'lt find Of music yet unknown: past, future,âboth. The Praiser of Admetus' noble Wife True marriage prophesied: an argument As close as Milton's, when that seÃ«r went From Freedom's temple down unto his home; Not less a poet then than by the strife Angelic standing when high heaven was rent. He, who best sang of God and Man's Descent, Sang also of the Paradise to come. And He who wears the Constellated Crownâ As king of human mindsâwithin the rim Of his wide realm may see a Brighter dim The starry point of each haught pyramid. Brightest the Star whose beams are farthest thrown, Whereby the storm-confused his sails may trim. Higher than Hamlet the Promethean Hymn Of the far future Shelley hath unhid. The Poet is the Prophet: nothing less. 'Tis he who, lark-like, biddeth Toil aspire; Or through our wilderness, a pillar'd fire, Goeth before us. Though he seem a cloud, In this broad glare of little-knowingness, Ere night our Best shall follow and admire. The Pole-star of Man's Life is in the Lyre. Stoop not, O Poet! from thy causeway proud. THE POET'S MISSION âIs but prophetic vision: âTo him the daring heart is grantedâ âNot the hand.â Herwegh. Learn higher apprehending Of the Poet's task! To him are God and Nature lending Ore of mighty thought, That for such use as the world's need may ask Fit iron may be wrought. The passionate impulse furnaced In the Poet's heart Must weld stern word and action earnest: Poet word and deed In harmony: that he may take God's part, And earn a true life's meed. Clear vision ever lendeth Faith to his life: Then only he his mission comprehendeth When he can wield his soul Or to creative thought or daily strife, With artist-like controul. Not in the purer heaven Of his own thought To dwell, enparadised, to him was given The poet-fire: But that a grander, truer life be wrought,â The world exampled higher. Not only do God's Angels Behold him with clear eyes: But day and night they speed his dread evangels Over the world,â Their seraph-wings of act and sacrifice Eternally unfurl'd. LABOUR IN VAIN O not âin vainâ! Even poor rotting weeds Nourish the roots of fruitfullest fair trees: So from thy fortune-loathÃ©d hope proceeds The experience that shall base high victories. The tree of the good and evil knowledge needs A rooting place in thoughtful agonies. Failures of lofty essays are the seeds Out of whose dryness, when cold night dissolves Into the dawning Spring, fertilities Of healthiest promise leap rejoicingly. Therefore hold on thy way, all undismay'd At the bent brows of Fate, untiringly! Knowing thisâpast all the woe our earth involves Sooner or later Truth must be obey'd. PRINCIPLE AND OPINION Principle and Opinion. Of the last I deem but lightly: 'tis a thing of change; Holds not the earnest man, or holds not fast; But which he holds, subjected to the range Of thought and time and chance. A man can yield Opinion, hide it, quit it, or defer. Not so with Principle: he anchors there; It is his lever; it hath power to wield His life, to make him ever minister To its behests; it is his soul, his life; And whether it shall bring him peace or strife Is wide o' the mark; it is his sword, his shield, His dominant chord. They are thus different: That Principle is fate, Opinion accident. THOUGHT AND DEED God thought of his creation and 'twas done: For in God's nature thought, will, deed, are one. And he approacheth unto God most near Whose thoughts in acts their true responses hear. Action is natural echo of true will. Thought is the seed, and will the secret growth Till act bursts into daylight. Will's an oath To accomplish thought,âto elaborate, fulfil, And realize the idea in visible life. Thought is a prophecy. He puts the knife To his own growth whose being ends in thought, Whose thought hath but the stunted growth of words. 'Tis as if warriors, having forged their swords, Should dream the fight was won, that forged was fought. WORD AND DEED (To Joseph Mazzini) I saidâWhose life is but of thought and word He is as one who having forged his sword Sleeps dreaming victory won: for I was wroth, Seeing how thought and action are divorced In these dull times, stern principle enforced To hide in the closet. I should be most loath To speak or think irreverently of thoseâ The Lords of Thought, whose words are warrior-blows In the world-conflict. Yet of them the best Not only spoke, but did; as faith had need Of utterance poured forth true word or deed. Witness our Milton, his great heart express'd In his daily life! and witness thou, my Friend! Whose aim steps firmly on to the same heroic end. JUNEâ1849 For Rome! for Italy!âOur thoughts, our words Rush forth impetuously. Would they might be Swift-wing'd as angels, with eternal swords To smite âGod's Unforgiven.â O to see Our new Camillus scourge those slaves of Gaul Home to their infamy! Ye ruins grand Of the time-reverenced Coliseum! fall, And with Saint Peter's and the Vatican Be one wide undistinguishable heap Ere over Rome the AccursÃ©d dare to creep. Freemen of Rome! your ancient heroes man The eternal ramparts. Lo, thy martyr band, Ruffini! leads us.âBuild yon batter'd wall With living men!âO Roman Victory! (Decemberâ1864) JUNEâ1849 For Rome! for Italy!âay! for the world: It is one quarrel. True Republican! Where'er thy banner'd faith may be unfurl'd There be thy heart. Thy cause is that of Man, The cause of the People; and where'er upheld (Amid Carpathian wilds, or on the steeps Of Caucasus, above the pride of Eld Over the Vatican, or midst the heaps Of England's shameful traffic), thou dost well To throw thy spirit into danger's van. For Rome! for Rome! O that our swords were there. Thou Land of Brutus and of Raffaelle And of Mazzini! how could we despair Of Thee, the Holy and Invincible? (Ora e sempre) OUR COUNTRY Let us serve our Country! Whether times be good, Or disaster whelm her Like a winter flood. Let us serve our Country: Give her life or death; Give her every action, Hope, and breath! Let us serve our Country! Where our Fathers' dust Makes each acre holy, Every field a trust. Let us serve our Country! Where our homesteads are; Lift her fame to heaven,â Worth's own star. Let us serve our Country! That belovÃ©d land, Bride-like, proudly beauteous, Wonderfully grand. Let us serve her gladly, Serve her even to death, Worship her with action, Hope, and breath! BE THYSELF England! be thyself again: Lift thy life before the world, Like a royal flag unfurl'd High above the tented plain. England! be thyself again: Think of thy old hero deeds; They were promises and seeds,â Were they pledged and sown in vain? Raise thy spirit from the mire: Peace and plenteous bread are good; But true Honour needeth food, Peace owns Righteousness her sire. Ne'er so plenteously fed, Duty to the world remains: Shalt thou only count thy gains While the lands in chains are led? Doth the clank of prisoners' bonds Hurt no more the English ear? Is it England knoweth fear? Cromwell's England that desponds? Careless of the Captive's moan, Fearful of Oppression's strength, Doubting if our sword have length, If the quarrel is our own?â England! be again thyself. Brave forbearance may be wise: This poor craft of Cowardice Cowering in the hole of Pelf Saveth neither pence nor toil, Gaineth but a shameful hour, Wherein Wrong takes breath of power And so tighteneth the coil. England! be thyself again: Ask not what may serve the time; See where standeth Truth sublime, Ask her will, and be thou fain. If her bidding must be war, Gird thy sword upon thy thigh; Shout to the heavens thy battle-cry; Let thy voice be heard afar, Heralding the sunny gleam Of thy swift and steady blade, Leaping through the realms dismay'd, As the daylight cleaves a dream. 1854 Tell the Tzar of England's glories, Let him learn the deeds of yore! Tell him how we fought at Florez, How we won at Azincour! Tell him of the great Armada Wreck'd upon our English shore! Say, for all our peaceful bearing, England yet hath noble blood; Dwarf'd we may be, yet our daring Mocks his height in field or flood: We have men whose hearts are higher Than the ebb of Cheapside mud. Tell him Thor's unerring hammer Fitteth yet an English hand; Say, at our first battle-clamour Arthur comes from fairy-land; Alfred fronteth the invader, Drake hath his far-reaching brand. Mind him of our Portland glory, Of the Nile and Trafalgar; Say, such is the unfinish'd story Of the Book of English War; Copenhagen unto Cronstadt, Tell him, is not overfar. Tell him, our unwaning glories Ruin's self could never dim, Though all England lay at Florez, Though all Europe bay'd with him: He might then beware his triumph,â Grenville's look is very grim. HEART AND WILL Our England's heart is sound as oak; Our English will is firm; And through our actions Freedom spoke, In History's proudest term: When Blake was lord from shore to shore, And Cromwell ruled the land, And Milton's words were shields of power To stay the oppressor's hand. Our England's heart is yet as sound, As firm our English will; And tyrants, be they cowl'd or crown'd, Shall find us fearless still. And though our Vane be in his tomb, Though Hampden's blood is cold, Their spirits live to lead our doom As in the days of old. Our England's heart is stout as oak; Our English will as brave As when indignant Freedom spoke From Eliot's prison grave. And closing yet again with Wrong, A world in arms shall see Our England foremost of the Strong And first among the Free. A NATIONAL HYMN O GOD! our England save. God! who o'er land and wave Didst lead our siresâ Lead us, through glorious deeds, Wherever Truth proceeds, And crown each day with meeds Of high desires. O God! who rulÃ©st rightâ O God! whose word is mightâ That word fulfil: Teach us to do and dare, Make England's life a prayer, Her hope a zealous care To work thy will. Let our Republic stand Ever at Fame's right hand, Stalwart and free: Give us heroic health: So we, despising stealth, May make our Commonwealth Worthy of thee. O Truth! our England bless: So we through every stress Shall proudly march: Gird thou our sheathless sword; Speak thou our charging word; Welcome the battle's lord Under thy arch. Honour! be thou our guide: Lead thou our holy pride Over the earth: Till all the nations be, Even as England, free; Till the last tyrant flee Before our worth. PRAYER FOR ENGLAND (Sicilian Mariners' Hymn) Power that mouldest Virtue's boldest! Make our England choicest earth: Give us daring, With true caring Both for freedom and for worth. A PRAYER FOR TRUTH O God! the Giver of all which men call good Or ill, the Origin and Soul of Power! I pray to Thee as all must in their hour Of need, for solace, medicine, or food, Whether aloud, or secretlyâunderstood No less by Thee. I pray: but not for fame, Nor love's best happiness, nor place, nor wealth. I ask Thee only for that spiritual health Which is perception of the Trueâthe same As in Thy Nature: so to know, and aim Tow'rd Thee my thought, my word, my whole of life. Then matters little whether care, or strife, Hot sun, or cloud, o'erpass this earthly day: Night cometh, and my star climbeth Thy Heaven-way.</field>
