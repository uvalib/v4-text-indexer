      <field name="fulltext">THE COMING OF LOVE RHONA BOSWELL'S STORY AN IDYL OF THE OPEN AIR CHARACTERS Percy Aylwin of Rington Manor (Kinsman of Henry Aylwin of Raxton Hall). The Scholar Gypsy. Rhona Boswell. Sinfi Lovell (the famous Seeress of Snowdon) Jericho Boswell, sometimes called “Jasper” (Rhona's father). Panuel Lovell (Sinfi's father). Videy Lovell (Sinfi's sister). Old Mrs. Herne. Sagul. James Herne (called the ‘Scollard”). Part I PERCY BEFORE THE COMING OF LOVE I A STARRY NIGHT AT SEA If heaven's bright halls are very far from sea, I dread a pang the angels could not 'suage: The imprisoned seabird knows, and only he, How drear, how dark, may be the proudest cage. Outside the bars he sees a prison still: The self-same wood or mead or silver stream That lends the captive lark a joyous thrill Is landscape in the seabird's prison-dream. So might I pine on yonder starry floor For sea-wind, deaf to all the singing spheres; Billows like these, that never knew a shore, Might mock mine eyes and tease my hungry ears; No scent of amaranth, moly, or asphodel, In lands that bloom above yon glittering vault. Could soothe me if I lost this briny smell, This living breath of Ocean, sharp and salt. II NATURE'S FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH (A morning swim off Guernsey with a Friend.) As if the Spring's fresh groves should change and shake To dark green woods of Orient terebinth, Then break to bloom of England's hyacinth, So 'neath us change the waves, rising to take Each kiss of colour from each cloud and flake Round many a rocky hall and labyrinth, Where sea-wrought column, arch, and granite plinth, Show how the sea's fine rage dares make and break. Young with the youth the sea's embrace can lend, Our glowing limbs, with sun and brine empearled, Seem born anew, and in your eyes, dear friend, Rare pictures shine, like fairy flags unfurled, Of child-land, where the roofs of rainbows bend Over the magic wonders of the world. III. THE LANGUAGE OF NATURE'S FRAGRANCY. (The Tiring-room in the Rocks.) These are the “Coloured Caves” the sea-maid built; Her walls are stained beyond that lonely fern, For she must fly at every tide's return, And all her sea-tints round the walls are spilt. Outside behold the bay, each headland gilt With morning's gold; far off the foam-wreaths burn Like fiery snakes, while here the sweet waves yearn On sand more soft than Avon's sacred silt. And smell the sea! no breath of wood or field, From lips of may or eglantine, Comes with the language of a breath benign, Shuts the dark room where glimmers Fate revealed, Calms the vext spirit, balms a sorrow unhealed, Like scent of seaweed rich of morn and brine. IV LOVE BRINGS WARNING OF NATURA MALIGNA. (Percy sailing with a friend past the Casquette Lighthouse.) Amid the Channel's wiles and deep decoys, Where yonder Beacons watch the siren-sea, A girl was reared who knew nor flower nor tree Nor breath of grass at dawn, yet had high, joys; The moving lawns whose verdure never cloys Were hers. At last she sailed to Alderney, But there she pined. “The bustling world,” said she, “Is all too full of trouble, full of noise.” The storm-child, fainting for her home, the storm, Had winds for sponsor—one proud rock for nurse, Whose granite arms, through countless years, disperse All billowy squadrons tide and wind can form: The cold bright sea was hers for universe Till o'er the waves Love flew and fanned them warm. But Love brings Fear with eyes or augury:— Her lover's boat was out; her ears were dinned With sea-sobs warning of the awakened wind That shook the troubled sun's red canopy. Even while she prayed the storm's high revelry Woke petrel, gull—all revellers winged and finned— And clutched a sail brown-patched and weather-thinned, And then a swimmer fought a white, wild sea. “My songs are louder, child, than prayers of thine,” The Mother sang. “Thy sea-boy waged no strife With Hatred's poison, gangrened Envy's knife— With me he strove, in deadly sport divine, Who lend to men, to gods, an hour of life, Then give them sleep within these arms of mine!” V MOTHER CAREY'S CHICKEN (Percy, on seeing a storm-petrel in a cage on a cottage wall near Gypsy Dell, takes down the cage with the view of releasing the bird.) I cannot brook thy gaze, belovèd bird; That sorrow is more than human in thine eye; Too deeply, brother, is my spirit stirred To see thee here, beneath the landsmen's sky, Cooped in a cage with food thou canst not eat, Thy “snow-flake” soiled, and soiled those conquering feet That walked the billows, while thy “sweet-sweet-sweet” Proclaimed the tempest nigh. Bird whom I welcomed while the sailors cursed, Friend whom I blessed wherever keels may roam, Prince of my childish dreams, whom mermaids nursed In purple of billows—silver of ocean-foam, Abashed I stand before the mighty grief That quells all other: Sorrow's King and Chief, Who rides the wind and holds the sea in fief, Then finds a cage for home! From out thy jail thou seest yon heath and woods, But canst thou hear the birds or smell the flowers? Ah, no! those rain-drops twinkling on the buds Bring only visions of the salt sea-showers. “The sea!” the linnets pipe from hedge and heath; “The sea!” the honeysuckles whisper and breathe, And tumbling waves, where those wild-roses wreathe, Murmur from inland bowers. These winds so soft to others—how they burn! The mavis sings with gurgle and ripple and plash, To thee yon swallow seems a wheeling tern; And when the rain recalls the briny lash. Old Ocean's kiss we love—oh, when thy sight Is mocked with Ocean's horses—manes of white, The long and shadowy flanks, the shoulders bright— Bright as the lightning's flash— When all these scents of heather and brier and whin, All kindly breaths of land-shrub, flower, and vine, Recall the sea-scents, till thy feathered skin Tingles in answer to a dream of brine— When thou, remembering there thy royal birth, Dost see between the bars a world of dearth, Is there a grief—a grief on all the earth— So heavy and dark as thine? But I can buy thy freedom—I (thank God!), Who loved thee more than albatross or gull— Loved thee, and loved the waves thy footsteps trod— Dreamed of thee when, becalmed, we lay a-hull— 'Tis I, thy friend, who once, a child of six, To find where Mother Carey fed her chicks, Climbed up the boat and then with bramble sticks Tried all in vain to scull— Thy friend who shared thy Paradise of Storm— The little dreamer of the cliffs and coves, Who knew thy mother, saw her shadowy form Behind the cloudy bastions where she moves, And heard her call: “Come! for the welkin thickens, And tempests mutter and the lightning quickens!” Then, starting from his dream, would find the chickens Were daws or blue rock-doves— Thy friend who owned another Paradise, Of calmer air, a floating isle of fruit, Where sang the Nereids on a breeze of spice, While Triton, from afar, would sound salute: There wast thou winging, though the skies were calm; For marvellous strains, as of the morning's shalm Were struck by ripples round that isle of palm Whose shores were Ocean's lute. And now to see thee here, my king, my king, Far-glittering memories mirrored in those eyes, As if there shone within each iris-ring An orbèd world—ocean and hills and skies!— Those black wings ruffled whose triumphant sweep Conquered in sport!—yea, up the glimmering steep Of highest billow, down the deepest deep, Sported with victories!— To see thee here!—a coil of wilted weeds Beneath those feet that danced on diamond spray, Rider of sportive Ocean's reinless steeds— Winner in Mother Carey's Sabbath-fray When, stung by magic of the Witch's chant, They rise, each foamy-crested combatant— They rise and fall and leap and foam and gallop and pant Till albatross, sea-swallow, and cormorant Must flee like doves away! And shalt thou ride no more where thou hast ridden, And feast no more in hyaline halls and caves, Master of Mother Carey's secrets hidden, Master and monarch of the wind and waves, Who never, save in stress of angriest blast, Asked ship for shelter—never till at last The foam-flakes hurled against the sloping mast Slashed thee like whirling glaives? Right home to fields no seamew ever kenned, Where scarce the great sea-wanderer fares with thee, I come to take thee—nay, 'tis I, thy friend! Ah, tremble not—I come to set thee free; I come to tear this cage from off this wall, And take thee hence to that fierce festival Where billows march and winds are musical, Hymning the Victor-Sea! Yea, lift thine eyes to mine. Dost know me now? Thou'rt free! thou'rt free! Ah, surely a bird can smile! Dost know me, Petrel? Dost remember how I fed thee in the wake for many a mile, Whilst thou wouldst pat the waves, then, rising, take The morsel up and wheel about the wake? Thou'rt free, thou'rt free, but for thine own dear sake I keep thee caged awhile. Away to sea! no matter where the coast: The road that turns for home turns never wrong; Where waves run high my bird will not be lost: His home I know: 'tis where the winds are strong— Where, on a throne of billows, rolling hoary And green and blue and splashed with sunny glory, Far, far from shore—from farthest promontory— Prophetic Nature bares the secret of the story That holds the spheres in song! (Percy, carrying the bird in the cage, turns to cross a rustic wooden bridge leading past Gypsy Dell, when he suddenly comes upon a landsman-friend of his, a “Scholar-Gypsy,” who is just parting from a lovely young Gypsy-girl. He stands dazzled, for he recalls that she is the same gypsy girl whom he saw on Raxton Strand the day he went out to sea, a year before. He forgets the petrel. The bird pushes its way through the half-open door and flies away.) VI. SCENE: RINGTON PINGLE. THE KAS-KAIRIN' GHYLLIE. (A hayfield on the Rington Estate. A group of gypsy hay-makers have just finished their noon-day meal and are enjoying a rest by the hedge-side beneath the shadow of the willows that overhang a large pond covered with yellow and white water-lilies. At the other end of the meadow, near Rington Grove, village girls are seen hay-making. A very tall gypsy girl, Sinfi Lovell, the famous seeress of Snowdon, is playing the Kas-Kairin' Ghyllie (Hay-making chorus) upon her crwth (the old Welsh violin). Rhona Boswell and the other gypsy girls are singing to the air. Jericho Boswell (Rhona's father), Panuel Lovell (Sinfi's father), Videy Lovell (her sister), Sagul, Perpinia, old Mrs. Herne, Jim Boswell (the gypsy boxing-hero), and Jim Herne, called “the Scollard” (who is in love with Rhona), are all sitting in a circle with a little keg of beer in the midst. Percy Aylwin and his friend the scholar gypsy are looking on. Percy stands looking at Rhona like a man bewitched.) KAS-KAIRIN' CHORUS. RHONA. Smell the scent the breeze is blowin'! Gypsies' love of woodland perfumes is proverbial. Indeed, their olfactories are far more sensitive than those of the gorgios. I have known a gypsy girl walking along the high road, stop suddenly and cry out, “I smells a fox!” and then I have seen the fox in the distance running along the end of a field. Hear the chirikels Birds. what they say, ‘Never a garden-rose a-glowin', Never a meadow-flower a-growin', Can match the smell from a Rington mowin' O' new made hay!’ CHORUS. Make the kas Hay while the kem sun. says ‘make it!’ RHONA. Toss it, tumble it, cock it, rake it— CHORUS. Scent the meadows! RHONA. Shake it, shake it! SINFI. All along the river reaches ‘Cheep, cheep, chee!’—from osier an' sedge; ‘Cuckoo, cuckoo!’ rings from the beeches; Every chirikel's Birds. song beseeches Ryes Gentlemen to larn what Lennor summer. teaches From copse and hedge. CHORUS. Make the kas Hay while the kem sun. says ‘make it!’ SINFI. Toss it, tumble it, cock it, rake it— CHORUS. Scent the meadows! SINFI. Shake it, shake it! RHONA. Lennor Summer. sets 'em singin' an' pairin' Chirikels Birds. all in tree an' grass,— Farmers say, ‘Them gals Girls. are darin', Sometimes dukkerin', sometimes snarin' Fortune-telling., But see their forks at a quick kas-kairin' Hay-making. Toss the kas Hay.!’ CHORUS. Make the kas Hay while the kem sun. says ‘make it!’ RHONA. Toss it, tumble it, cock it, rake it— CHORUS. Scent the meadows! RHONA. Shake it, shake it! PERPINIA. While them milk-faced gorgie-sillies Gentile women. In yon swathes by Rington Grove Drink with mumply gorgio-billies Gentile men., Field-flowers here an' water-lilies Hearin' the chirikels Birds sing their ghyllies songs.,— Laugh with love. CHORUS. Make the kas Hay while the kem sun. says ‘make it’! PERPINIA. Toss it, tumble it, cock it, rake it— CHORUS. Scent the meadows! PERPINIA. Shake it, shake it! SAGUL. Hark the sharpenin' scythes that tingle! What say Rington Farmers. farmin' ryes? ‘Leave them tents in Gypsy Dingle! Never a gorgie Gentile women., married or single, Can toss the kas Hay. in Rington Pingle Like Romany chies Gypsy girls.,’ CHORUS. Make the kas Hay while the kem sun. says ‘make it’! SAGUL.

(At the conclusion of the song Percy and his friend walk away, and the scholar Gypsy tells Percy an anecdote of Rhona Boswell as a child.) VII. NATURA BENIGNA REVEALED THROUGH A GYPSY CHILD. The Scholar-Gypsy's story of Rhona Boswell as a Child ‘The child arose and danced through frozen dells, Drawn by the Christmas chimes, and soon she sate Where, 'neath the snow around the churchyard gate, The ploughmen slept in bramble-banded cells: The gorgios pass'd, half-fearing gypsy-spells, Gentiles. While Rhona gazing seem'd to meditate; Then laugh'd for joy, then wept disconsolate: ‘De poor dead gorgios cannot hear de bells.’ Within the church the clouds of gorgio-breath Arose, a steam of lazy praise and prayer To Him who weaves the loving Christmas-stair O'er sorrow and sin and wintry deeps of Death; But where stood He? Beside our Rhona there, Remembering childish tears in Nazareth.” For this anecdote of Rhona Boswell as a child I am indebted to my friend Francis Hindes Groome, author of “In Gipsy Tents” and the Romany novel, “Kriegspiel.” CONCLUSION OF PART I. Part II THE DAUGHTER OF THE SUNRISE I RHONA'S FIRST KISS (Percy alone in Rington Furze: Rhona has just left him.) If only in dreams may Man be fully blest, Is heaven a dream? Is she I claspt a dream? Or stood she here even now where dew-drops gleam And miles of furze shine yellow down the West? I seem to clasp her still—still on my breast Her bosom beats: I see the bright eyes beam. I think she kiss'd these lips, for now they seem Scarce mine: so hallow'd of the lips they press'd. Yon thicket's breath—can that be eglantine? Those birds—can they be Morning's choristers? Can this be Earth? Can these be banks of furze? Like burning bushes fired of God they shine! I seem to know them, though this body of mine Passed into spirit at the touch of hers! II THE GOLDEN HAND Among the Gypsies of all countries the happiest possible “Dukkeripen” (i.e., prophetic symbol of Natura Mystica) is a hand-shaped golden cloud floating on the sky. It is singular that the same idea is found among races entirely disconnected with them—the Finns, for instance, with whom Ukko, the “sky god” or “angel of the sunrise,” was called the “golden king” and “leader of the clouds,” and his Golden Hand was more powerful than all the army of Death. The “Golden Hand” is sometimes called the Lover's Dukkeripen. PERCY. Do you forget that day on Rington strand When, near the crumbling ruin's parapet, I saw you stand beside the long-shore net The gorgios spread to dry on sun-lit sand? RHONA. Do I forget? PERCY. You wove the wood-flowers in a dewy band Around your hair which shone as black as jet: No fairy's crown of bloom was ever set Round brows so sweet as those the wood-flowers spanned. I see that picture now; hair dewy-wet: Dark eyes that pictures in the sky expand: Love-lips (with one tattoo “for dukkerin”) Good-luck. tanned By sunny winds that kiss them as you stand. RHONA. Do I forget? The Golden Hand shone there: it's you forget, Or p'raps us Romanies ondly understand The way the Lovers' Dukkeripen is planned Which shone that second time when us two met. PERCY. Blest “Golden Hand”! RHONA. The wind, that mixed the smell o' violet Wi' chirp o' bird, a-blowin' from the land Where my dear mammy lies, said as it fanned My heart-like, “Them 'ere tears makes mammy fret.” She loves to see her chavi Child. lookin' grand, So I made what you call'd a coronet, And in the front I put her amulet: She sent the Hand to show she sees me yet. PERCY. Blest “Golden Hand”! III RHONA'S LOVE LETTER AFTER PERCY'S FIRST STAY IN GYPSY DELL Gypsy Dell, Wensdy.

And ivy-leaves are tapping at the pane: Dawn draws across the grey a saffron streak, To let me read at sunrise once again Beautiful Rhona's letter, which has lain, Balming the pillow underneath my cheek, While in the dark her writing seemed to speak: Her great eyes lit my brain. I felt the paper—felt her thumb's device That stamped the wax; I seemed to feel the fingers Which wrote these misspelt words of rarer price Than songs of bards I worshipped as the bringers Of light from shores where spheral music lingers, Till came this girl, whose music could entice My soul to that diviner Paradise Where lovers are the singers— That Paradise which Rhona can transfer From Eden to the tents of Gypsy Dell, Where Love is still his own orthographer As when on scriptured leaves of asphodel He taught his earliest pupil, Eve, to spell— Where Love speaks out what makes his bosom stir Frankly as yonder woodland chorister, Whose first notes rise and swell. V EVENING ON THE RIVER PERCY AND RHONA. More mellow falls the light and still more mellow Around the boat, as we two glide along 'Tween grassy banks she loves where, tall and strong, The buttercups stand gleaming, smiling, yellow. She knows the nightingales of “Portobello;” Love makes her know each bird! In all that throng No voice seems like another: soul is song, And never nightingale was like its fellow; For, whether born in breast of Love's own bird, Singing its passion in those islet-bowers Whose sunset-coloured maze of leaves and flowers The rosy river's glowing arms engird, Or born in human souls—twin souls like ours— Song leaps from deeps unplumbed by spoken word. VI THE NATURE WORSHIPPER AND WOMAN'S WITCHERY (Percy walking along the river-side near Gypsy Dell at break of day.) Love knows a wrong no tears can ever atone: A word can break the web of Passion's spell, And then away the enchanted woof is blown That made a faery world of wood and dell: But direr than all direst words are deeds:— Can I, who saw her body shake and sway Before a storm of rage, like yonder reeds When March winds bend them o'er the water-weeds— Can I forgive that wrong of yesterday?— Can I, who saw the lips of this wild girl, So loving once, shrink back till pearly teeth, That once seemed lovelier than the morning's pearl, Flashed bright as that bright blade she dared unsheathe— Can I, who saw a brow, a throbbing throat Glassed in the stream beneath the willow tree, As up she sprang, a tigress, in the boat— Can I forgive her, though the siren wrote The loveliest letter in the world to me? (He comes upon a second letter from Rhona lying on the grass, and stands looking at it with yearning eyes, but afraid to pick it up.) Another letter! Ah, full well I know Those characters so childish, big, and round: I think she watches where the hawthorns throw Those shortening shadows on the dewy ground. Ah yes! that head which gleams by yonder bush, Where golden shafts from out the quiver of morn Pierce the wet leaves and wake the hidden thrush— That cheek which seems to lend a lovelier blush To blushing may-buds on the dew-bright thorn! (He takes up the letter and reads it aloud.) THE LETTER. This time you can't forgive me—that I know— But when I'm dead o' cryin and in the groun, You'll come, afore my grass has time to grow, And say, “That's hern; the clods is fresh and brown. Lord, how I misses her in puv Field. and tan Tent.,” You'll say, “that gal wot axed me to forgive her! It druv her mad to see me kis my han And smile so sweet—pore Rhona's ondly man!— To that fine rawni Lady. rowin on the river. Pore gal,” you'll say, “she never touched her knife, Leaseways, just touched the handel so,” you'll say; “She'd never ha' drawed: she wur to bee my wife, And loved me, loved me, loved me night and day. What made the chi Girl.,” you'll say, “start from the seat? What made her flesh goo hot and cold and shiver Right down her back-like—yis, from hed to feet? She seed me kis my han and smile so swete To that fine rawni rowin on the river. The Dell,” you'll say, “do seem that dul and sad; It dreems o' one wot loved me body and soul, And loved me most that day I druv her madd And turned her choori zee Poor heart. to burnin coal; The chiriklos Birds. The birds attend the funeral of a true Romany maid. 'ull chirp ‘He should ha' gien All them sweet smiles—yis, all he had to give her— To her we buried with her Romany kin, And laid wi' clods all round her eyes an' chin, Through that fine rawni rowin on the river.’” You'll say, “Instead o' havin Jasper's gal, So spry at snare and rod and landin net, This teeny clisson from her korley bal Lock from her dark hair. Clisson really means a lock for a key. Is all, and that'll ondly make me frett. I'd sooner fish wi' her where swallows fan The brook,” you'll say, “where water creases quiver, Tryin to hide the trouts, but never can, Than smile so sweet and look and kis my han To that fine rawni rowin on the river. 'Twur here,” you'll say, “where many and many a night We stayed a-settin snares in Gypsy Dell Beneath the stars, or when the moon wur bright, Till ‘twitter’ came the arliest chirikel Bird., And larks the sunshine turned to specks o' gold Flew whistlin up, but none as could deliver A tale o' love like that as then wur told By that pore Rhona, her wot's dead and cold.” PERCY. The witching rogue! But still I can't forgive her. THE LETTER CONTINUED. “'Twur here,” you'll say, “'twur here, dooey choons aglal, Two months ago. Out o' her daddy's tan Tent. one night there crep' A gal to meet me—sich a rinkeni Handsome. gal— Though well she knowed the watch the Scollard kep': She stayed wi' me till all the eastern sky Biled, steamed, and broke to many a fiery slivver That lit up puv and tan and sooterin grei Field and tent and sleeping horse.”: You'll seem to feel her lips— RHONA. (Advancing from the bush, watching him as he reads, then rushing towards him, covering his eyes with her hands, and pulling down his head and kissing him.) These lips, my Rye! PERCY. These lips, indeed! Ah! who would not forgive her? RHONA. Lips as 'ud turn to clods without you, dear! PERCY. But how this loving Rhona tries my love! RHONA. And yet she'd walk the world barefoot to hear Them words o' yourn in tan or vesh or puv Tent, wood, field.— Yis, walk and never know her feet wur sore To hear you say, “Ah! who would not forgive her?” PERCY. But that young lady? RHONA. Her what flicks her oar? PERCY. The same. RHONA. You'll never kiss your han no more To that fine rawni rowin on the river? (Two gypsies, Herne the “Scollard” and another, rush out from the bushes, and throw themselves upon Percy. The “Scollard” seizes Percy's throat and raises a knife. Rhona leaps forward and plunges her gypsy knife into the “Scollard's” shoulder, which makes him drop his weapon. Another gypsy then runs forward from another bush. Rhona springs in front of Percy, who stands gasping, having been almost choked. The gypsies stop, cowed as much by Rhona's threatening gaze as by the knife, and, eventually seeing that Percy is reviving, slink away.) VII. “KISSING THE MAY BUDS.” “It's nice to see Rhona on a summer mornin', kissin' the may buds for ‘luck o' love,’ as us Romanies say.” —Sinfi Lovell. (Rhona, half-hidden by the branches of a hawthorn tree, is stretching up to kiss the white and green may buds.) PERCY. (Looking at her.) Can this be she, who, on that fateful day When Romany knives leapt out at me like stings, Hurled back the men, who shrank like stricken things From Rhona's eyes, whose lightnings seemed to slay? Can this be she, half-hidden in the may, Kissing the buds for “luck o' love” it brings, While from the dingle-grass the skylark springs, And merle and mavis answer finch and jay? (He goes up to the hawthorn, pulls the branches apart and clasps her in his arms.) Can she here covering with her childish kisses These pearly buds—can she so soft, so tender, So shaped for clasping—dowered of all love-blisses— Be my fierce girl whose love for me would send her, An angel storming hell, through death's abysses, Where never a sight could fright or power bend her? VIII OCEAN-SORCERY (Percy on the deck of “The Petrel” after he has been separated from Rhona.) Was it indeed but two sweet years ago When once a sailor on a star-lit sea Babbled about its spell, and did not know How Love makes Nature breathe her poesy? When did the sea-spell vanish? On that day When his beloved petrel flew away. But as for them who bade him, made him, come, Though love had crowned him man, to thee, wild Ocean, Prated of some nepenthe in thy foam To quell his love as by a magic potion— Some anodyne within thy billowy swirl To soothe the body—make the soul forget Its guileless passion for a “guileful girl” Whose beauty caught him in a “Gypsy net”— They should be here to see these billows heaving Beneath yon Southern Cross that holds the sky, They should be here to see how thou art weaving Pictures of home by ocean-sorcery! A dingle's fragrance breathed from every billow, Sweeter than Orient frankincense and myrrh— A slim girl-angler shown beneath a willow, Leaning against its mossy bole for pillow, Must needs recall his every thought to her! IX “GYPSY HEATHER.” “If you breathe on a heather-spray and send it to your man it'll show him the selfsame heather where it wur born.” —Sinfi Lovell. (Percy, standing on the deck of “The Petrel,” takes from his pocket a letter which, before he had set sail to return to the south seas, the Melbourne post had brought him—a letter from Rhona, staying then with the Boswells on a patch of heath much favoured by the Boswells, called “Gypsy Heather.” He takes from the envelope a withered heather-spray, encircled by a little scroll of paper on which Rhona has written the words “Remember Gypsy Heather.”) I Remember Gypsy Heather? Remember Jasper's camping-place Where heath-bells meet the grassy dingle, And scents of meadow wood and chase, Wild thyme and whin-flower seem to mingle? Remember where, in Rington Furze, I kissed her and she asked me whether I “thought my lips of teazel-burrs, That pricked her jis like whin-bush spurs, Felt nice on a rinkenny moey Pretty mouth. like hers.”— Gypsy Heather! II Remember Gypsy Heather? Remember her whom nought could tame But love of me, the poacher-maiden Who showed me once my father's game With which her plump round arms were laden, Who when my glances spoke reproach Said, “Things o' fur an' fin an' feather Like coneys, pheasants, perch an' loach, An' even the famous ‘Rington roach’ Wur born for Romany chies to poach!”— Gypsy Heather! III Remember Gypsy Heather? Atolls and reefs, you change, you change To dells of England dewy and tender, You palm-trees in yon coral range Seem “Rington Birches” sweet and slender Shading the ocean's fiery glare: We too are in the Dell together— My body is here, my soul there With lords of trap and net and snare, The Children of the Open Air,— Gypsy Heather! IV Remember Gypsy Heather? Its pungent breath is on the wind, Killing the scent of tropic water; I see her suitors, swarthy skinned, Who pine in vain for Jasper's daughter; The “Scollard,” with his features tanned By sun and wind as brown as leather— His forehead scarred with Passion's brand— Scowling at Sinfii tall and grand, Who sits with “Pharaoh” by her hand.— Gypsy Heather! V Remember Gypsy Heather? Now Rhona sits beneath the tree That shades our tent, alone and weeping; And him, the “Scollard,” him I see: From bush to bush I see him creeping— I see her mock him, see her run And free his pony from the tether, Who lays his ears in love and fun, And gallops with her in the sun Through lace the gossamers have spun.— Gypsy Heather! VI Remember Gypsy Heather? She reaches “Rington Birches”; now, Dismounting from the “Scollard's” pony, She sits alone with heavy brow, Thinking—but not of hare or coney. The hot sea holds each sight, each sound Of England's golden autumn weather: The Romanies now are sitting round The tea-cloth spread on grassy ground; Now Rhona dances heather-crowned.— Gypsy Heather! VII Remember Gypsy Heather? She's thinking of this withered spray Through all the dance; her eyes are gleaming Darker than night, yet bright as day, While round her a gypsy shawl is streaming; I see the lips—the upper curled, A saucy rose-leaf, from the nether, Whence—while the floating shawl is twirled, As if a ruddy cloud were swirled— Her scornful laugh at Herne is hurled Gypsy Heather! VIII Remember Gypsy Heather? In storm or calm, in sun or rain, There's magic, Rhona, in the writing Wound round these flowers whose purple stain Dims the dear scrawl of Love's inditing: Dear girl, this spray between the leaves (Now fading like a draggled feather With which the nesting song-bird weaves) Makes every wave the vessel cleaves Seem purple of heather as it heaves.— Gypsy Heather! IX Remember Gypsy Heather? Oh, Rhona! sights and sounds of home Are everywhere; the skylark winging Through amber cloud-films till the dome Seems filled with love, our love, a-singing The sea-wind seems an English breeze Bearing the bleat of ewe and wether Over the heath from Rington Leas, Where, to the hymn of birds and bees, You taught me Romany 'neath the trees.— Gypsy Heather! X THE MUSIC OF NATURA MYSTICA (Percy on board “The Petrel” in the Pacific, cruising among coral islands.) Last Sunday morn I thought this azure isle Was dreaming mine own dream; each bower of balm That spiced the rich Pacific, every palm, Smiled with the dream that lends my life its smile. “These waves,” I said, “lapping the coral pile Make music like a well-remembered psalm: Surely an English Sunday, breathing calm, Broods in each tropic dell, each flowery aisle.” The heaven's were dreaming, too, of English skies: Upon the blue, within a belt of grey, A well-known spire was pictured far away; And then I heard a psalm begin to rise, And saw a dingle—smelt its new-mown hay Where we two loitered—loitered lover-wise. XI. THE HAUNTED GIRL. (RHONA IN WALES.) Scene: Snowdon—Knocker's Llyn. (Sinfi Lovell, being anxious to use Rhona as a clairvoyante (in order to learn the fate of a certain friend of her own believed to be in danger abroad), has enticed her to leave the camp in Rington Hollow and accompany her to a llyn on Snowdon called Knocker's Llyn, on the face of whose waters the “knockers” (or gnomes) of Snowdon paint their pictures whenever they hear the sound of Sinfi's crwth. The two girls are standing on the rocky ledge overhanging the llyn. Sinfi is playing a wild air and Rhona in a hypnotic state is gazing intently into the llyn to read the knockers' pictures. But her soul is so absorbed in her grief at parting from Percy when he went to sea (promising to return with the “coming of the swallow”) that she can read nothing in the water but pictures of that parting.) SINFI. Now that the mornin's veil o' gold grows thin The haunted water shines so bright and clear That I can see the trouts, as I stand here, An' see the sunlight kindlin' every fin To yellow an' lollo Red. an' blue; yet Rhona's eyes Can read no fortunes in the Haunted Llyn Except her own and his, her tarno rei's. Young gentleman. But if the pennin o' the dukkerin Prophesying. fails, I've brought her here for nothink—here to Wales; I've made her leave the Dell and leave the Chace Where, in the leaves, she still could see the face She loves the more because it's far away. I plays the crwth, but all her lips can say Is jist the words, “He'll come, he'll come pallal Back.: Next summer I shall see my dear, I shall.” (Rhona in a kind of trance, talks in a dreamy voice about her recent parting with her lover in Gypsy Dell.) SINFI. Her sperrit's gone, jist liek a homin' dove, To Rington where she left her tarno rei The day they parted. She's in Rington Drove; Ah! well I knows a Romany chi Gypsy girl. in love Can't see no sights in water, earth or sky But sights o' one. She's bound in sich a chain My crwth 'll find it hard to clear her brain. The knockers too 'll find it hard to throw True pictures on the water and to show The dukkeripen Second sight. I wants to see and know. RHONA. (A strange kind of smile, painful and yet coaxing, passes over her features: her eyes seem filled with tears, while she murmurs in a wheedling tone.) We'll part beside the mill-pool,—here's the stream Where you whipped out that splutterin' boro Big. perch; Don't you remember what a leap an' lurch He gave, and druv the bleaks among the bream? . . . A little further dear! See—what a gleam O' mornin' lollo Red. strikes old Rington church! (She pauses for some time—then proceeds.) A little further dear!—to that big birch Where fust you kissed me—O it's like a dream, Your goin' away: it is, it is my darlin'! But you'll come back at swallow time, you will! (Again she pauses for some time: then proceeds.) Yes, here's the birch: but let's walk up the hill: Oh, look! A gypsy-magpie Water wagtail. an' a starlin, They're meetin' on the chaw Grass.!—Good luck you know Must follow you wherever now you go. (Sinfi looks with pitying eyes upon her face, occasionally turned up to hers. After a while she changes the measure of her music to a well-known air among the Welsh gypsies, called “The Parting Ghyllie Song.,” but it fails to call Rhona's spirit back from the Drove; it simply makes her thoughts on the one subject move in response to the new air.) RHONA. This path thro' the spinny is nearest Where the light, a quivering lace, Falls sweet through the pattinor Leaves., dearest— Oh! slacken the pace. (Sinfi's music now returns to the previous movement, and Rhona's chant answers to it.) RHONA. Another sign o' luck! See every where All twinklin' in the kem Sun., the blessed drops! On hedge an' hay-field, meadow an' lea an' copse! A million tarno Little. rainbows laugh in the air! Them cows look round with wrinkled necks to stare Stretched, chewin', chewin' in the buttercups, See! in that furrow in the young green crops That crouchin' shoshu Hare.—what a one to snare! An' that means luck; an' so does that sweet din O' blackbird, mavis, finch an' missel thrush. An' if the cuckoo's v'ice is rather thin, It's June you know!—I sees him in that bush: Let's go an' look, dear—plenty o' time for that— Lord how they hates him—linnet, finch an' chat! (Sinfi again changes the measure to the “Parting Ghyllie,” and again Rhona's chant responds to it; but her mind cannot be drawn from Rington Drove.) RHONA. Let us part where the river runs clearest Through the shadow an' shine o' the Chace Where often we've angled my dearest, For gudgeon and dace. (Sinfi returns to the previous air and again Rhona answers it by the changed movement of her chant.) RHONA. (In a still more coaxing tone.) You say we must part here at Rington Cross— Lord, how it minds me o' them snares we set, That day you got me that white violet For luck, you know: 'twur growin' in that green moss. Now fare ye well: it's hard to lose ye thus— I ain't a cryin'; but still it's hard—an' yet Sweet-like, to think I've got no call to fret; Good luck 'll come to you thro' Rhona's loss. An' here's the clisson—what you calls a curl— Take it an' think o' her you're leavin' here Till swallow-time—till swallow-time, next year For you'll be thought on by your Romany girl When bavals wel Winds come. an' strike an' shake an' dirl The ship. Let's walk a little farther, dear. (Sinfi again plays a bar or two of the “Parting Ghyllie” and again Rhona answers it.) RHONA. You called me that mornin', my dearest, When you see'd me at fust in the Place Camping place.— “Your Rhona, the best, the sincerest O' the Romany race.” (Sinfi returns to the previous air and again Rhona's chant responds to it.) RHONA. Let's take the meadow path an' smell the kas Hay.: How green the swathes look 'against them brownish cocks! Them chaps in shirt-sleeves, mowin'—an them in smocks, See how they're watchin' every rinkenny Pretty. lass. (An expression of playful humour shines through her tears.) Or is it that 'ere beer-cask on the grass?— I knows them gals with sunburnt cheeks an locks An' stick-burrs in their chuffas Petticoats. an' their frocks, Tossin' them swathes an' chatterin' as we pass; That one a starin', leanin' on her rake, Is that one's sister paddlin' in the brook. Hark, from the standin' chaw Grass. comes “crake, crake, crake!” (Her voice now breaks into sobs.) Now—leave me—here—behind these trees,—to look While—you walk on. (She totters and nearly falls into the llyn.) He's gone! my heart will break. (She sobbs hitterly in her trance.) SINFI. It's hard to see a lovin' woman cry, If only in a dream. Well, well, I know A tune 'll make the heaviest-hearted chi Girl. Stir to the music o' the heel and toe; The old Kas-Kairin' Ghyllie Haymaking song. 'll change her trance And make her think o' many a lennor Summer. dance And then, perhaps, the thought o' him 'll go. (Sinfi now plays “The Kas-Kairin' Ghyllie”; and at once Rhona springs away from the margin of the llyn, and begins to sing and dance to the air.) SINFI. Dancin' an' singin' as she used to sing An' dance one time in puvs Fields. o' Rington Hollow As merry as a skylark on the wing That mounts to meet the mornin' gold an' lollo Red. Like some poor chirickli Hen bird. what sorrows late An' sorrows airly, pinin' for her mate, Has she forgot who left her there to wait The comin' o' the swallow? (She begins to play softly and tentatively a bar of the “Parting Ghyllie” putting her arm round Rhona's waist. Tears at once start into Rhona's eyes, and she begins to murmur through her sobs.) RHONA. Closer, closer, my dearest! Let me feel the dear breath on my face! Closer, my nearest and dearest: The last embrace! XII LOVE'S CALENTURE (Percy on hoard “The Petrel” in a tropic calm.) I hear our blackbirds singing in our grove, And now I see—I smell—the eglantine— The meadow-sweet where rivulets laugh and shine To English clouds that laugh and shine above; I feel a stream of maiden-music move, Pouring through all my frame a life divine From Rhona's throbbing bosom claspt to mine— From that dear harp, her heart, whose chords are love! Vanished!— O God! a blazing world of sea— A blistered deck—an engine's grinding jar— Hot scents of scorching oil and paint and tar— And, in the offing up yon fiery lee, One spot in the air no bigger than a bee— A frigate-bird that sails alone afar! (He takes from his pocket and reads a letter from Rhona which reached him in Australia.) THE LETTER On Christmas-eve I seed in dreams the day When Herne the Scollard comed and said to me, Hes off, that rye Gentleman. o yourn, gone clean away Till swallow-time; hes left this letter: see! In dreams I heerd the bee and grasshopper, Like on that mornin, buz in Rington Hollow, Shell live till swallow-time and then shell mer, Die. For never will a rye Gentleman. come back to her Wot leaves her till the comin o the swallow. All night I heerd them bees and grasshoppers; All night I smelt the breath o grass and may, Mixed sweet wi smells o honey from the furze, Like on that mornin when you went away; All night I heerd in dreams my daddy sal, Laugh.

Mostly pronounced “mullo,” but sometimes in the East Midlands “mollo.” Rhona, she sez, that tarno rye you love, Hes thinkin on you; dont you go and rove Weep.; Youll see him at the comin o the swallow.

And she wur gone!

XIII THE FIRST DUKKERIPEN OF THE STARS (Percy on the night of his return to the encampment lingers before calling for the ferry-boat upon the tongue of land called Portobello, and looks down the river, where the stars are brilliantly reflected. Rhona, who has secretly come to meet him, appears on the opposite bank, but does not perceive him, owing to the shadowing trees under which he stands.) PERCY. What sees she in the river as it flows? Does she recall that summer night when we Rowed here beneath the stars—the night when she, Unconscious, then, of that within my breast Which held me mute, murmured in loving jest, “Our Tarno Rye, Young gentleman. he's dreamin while he rows”? Or is she gazing at the stars that shine Mirrored within the stream to read their sign— The dukkeripen Nature's prophetic symbol. of good or evil made By their reflections mingled with the shade Yon pollard willow throws? That night I murmured, “Life's one joy is this, To love, to taste the soul's divine delight Of loving some most lovely soul or sight— To worship still, though never an answering sign Should come from Love asleep within the shrine.” That night I said, “I ask no more of bliss Than—while beneath the boat the wavelets heave— To touch the gauds upon a gypsy's sleeve, To see the bright nails shine on glistening fingers, To see the throat on which the starlight lingers, The mouth I dare not kiss.” But that same night Love wrote around the prow In stars! Her trembling body turned to me In joyful fear of joy, and I could see, Pictured in frightened eyes, the blissful things A girl's pure soul can see when Love's young wings, Fragrant of heaven and earth, fan first the brow. (Rhona gives a sudden start and looks behind her.) What means that start? Why stands she there to listen? I see her eyes that in the starlight glisten— Her eyes—but not the thing of dread they see: She's feeling where her knife was wont to be— Ah, would she wore it now! (“The Scollard's” figure appears from behind the willow.) 'Tis he, my gypsy rival, by her side! He lifts a knife. She springs, the dauntless girl, Lithe as a leopardess! Ah! can she hurl The giant down the bank? (He prepares to plunge into the river in order to swim to her, when Rhona meets the onrush of her assailant with a blow in the mouth from her fist, which causes him to totter and then stumble over the bank.) He falls below, Falls where the river's darkest waters flow! Twice, thrice, he rises—sinks beneath the tide! Only the stars and I have seen him fall. Death is her doom who slays a Romany Gypsy.-chal And weds a gorgio Gentile.: death! But only we, The stars and I who love the slayer, could see The way the ruffian died. (He looks in the river, where the reflected stars make mysterious figures as the ripples twist round the bulrushes.) 'Twas only we who saw, ye starry throng! And one white lie of mine will hide the deed Of her who gave me love against her creed— The Romany woman's creed of tribal duty— Gave Rhona's wealth of love and faith and beauty. THE STARS WRITE IN THE RIVER. Falsehood can never shield her: Truth is strong. PERCY. I read your rune: is there no pity, then, In Heav'n that wove this net of life for men? Have only Hell and Falsehood heart for ruth? Show me, ye mirrored stars, this tyrant Truth— King that can do no wrong! Ah! Night seems opening! There, above the skies, Who sits upon that central sun for throne Round which a golden sand of worlds is strown, Stretching right onward to an endless ocean, Far, far away, of living dazzling motion? Hearken, King Truth with pictures in thine eyes Mirrored from gates beyond the furthest portal Of infinite light, 'tis Love that stands immortal, The King of Kings. And there on yonder bank Stands she, and, where the accursed carrion sank, The merry bubbles rise! At last she sees me on this tongue of land; She plunges through the fringe of reed and moss, She takes the boat; she's pulling straight across, Startling the moorhens as the dark prow brushes Through reeds and weeds and water-flags and rushes. Yes, yes, I saw! Is this the little hand That slew him? How the slender fingers quiver Against my lips! Those stars within the river May write of how he died, but Love, my darling, Looks straight at Doom, though wolves of Death are snarling, And smiles: “Behold, I stand!” XIV THE PROMISE OF THE SUNRISE (Percy in the tent on the morning after his marriage with Rhona in Gypsy Dell.) The young light peeps through yonder trembling chink The tent's mouth makes in answer to a breeze; The rooks outside are stirring in the trees Thro' which I see the deepening bars of pink. I hear the earliest anvil's tingling clink From Jasper's forge; the cattle on the leas Begin to low. She's waking by degrees: Sleep's rosy fetters melt, but link by link. What dream is hers? Her eyelids shake with tears; The fond eyes open now like flowers in dew: She sobs I know not what of passionate fears: “You'll never leave me now? There is but you; I dreamt a voice was whispering in my ears, ‘The Dukkeripen o' stars comes ever true.’” She rises, startled by a wandering bee Buzzing around her brow to greet the girl: She draws the tent wide open with a swirl, And, as she stands to breathe the fragrancy Beneath the branches of the hawthorn tree— Whose dews fall on her head like beads of pearl Or drops of sunshine firing tress and curl— The Spirit of the Sunrise speaks to me, And says, “This bride of yours, I know her well, And so do all the birds in all the bowers Who mix their music with the breath of flowers When greetings rise from river, heath and dell. See, on the curtain of the morning haze The Future's finger writes of happy days.” XV THE MIRRORED STARS AGAIN (After only a few months with her.) The mirrored stars lit all the bulrush-spears, And all the flags and broad-leaved lily-isles; The ripples shook the stars to golden smiles, Then smoothed them back to happy golden spheres. We rowed—we sang; her voice seemed in mine ears An angel's, yet with woman's dearer wiles; But shadows fell from gathering cloudy piles And ripples shook the stars to fiery tears. What shaped those shadows like another boat Where Rhona sat and he Love made a liar? There, where the Scollard sank, I saw it float, While ripples shook the stars to symbols dire; We wept—we kissed—while starry fingers wrote, And ripples shook the stars to a snake of fire. XVI THE PROMISE OF THE SUNRISE RENEWED (Percy, on the anniversary of the mysterious disappearance of Rhona, stands in the mouth of his solitary tent in Gypsy Dell. He looks towards the spire of Rington Church in the distance, over which the dawn is gradually brightening into a gorgeous sunrise.) Death's year has passed: again the new-mown hay, As on that night, perfumes the Dell—that night Whose darkness seemed more dear than Eden-light— Fragrant of Love's warm wings and Love's warm breath— Where here I left her doomed to treacherous death By Romany guile that lured me far away; 'Twas here—where petals of the morn are cast 'Mid Night's wild phantoms from the spectral past— 'Twas here she made the vow I smiled at then To show her face some morn when hill and glen Took the first kiss of Day. But now—not all the starry Virtues seven Seem strong as she, nor Time, nor Death, nor Night. And morning says, “Love hath such godlike might That if the sun, the moon, and all the stars, Nay, all the spheral spirits who guide their cars, Were quelled by Doom, Love's high-creative leaven Could light new worlds.” If, then, this Lord of Fate, When Death calls in the stars, can re-create, Is it a madman's dream that Love can show Rhona, my Rhona, in yon ruby glow, And build again my heaven? “The birds,” she said, “they knows us Romany chies Gypsy girls.— Leaseways the gypsy-magpie Water-wagtail. an the jay— They knows the Romany tongue—yis, all we say: So, if the Hernes should do away wi' me 'Cause o' the Scollard's death, the birds will see An' tell the flowers where Rhona's body lies. The Scollard's strong to strive wi' now he's dead: Outside the tent o' nights I hear his tread. You mind them stars a-shinin in the river That seemed a snake o' fire? I see'd you shiver: It had the Scollard's eyes! But when I'm dead, the Golden Hand o' Love Will shine some day where mists o' mornin swim; Me too you'll see, dear, when the sun's red rim Peeps through the Rookery boughs by Rington spire, And makes the wet leaves wink like stars o' fire; Then, when the skylark wakes the thrush and dove, An' squrrels jump, an' rabbits scrabble roun', An' hares cock up their ears a-shinin brown, An' grass an' blossoms mix their mornin smells Wi' Dingle songs from all the chirikels Birds., You'll see me there above.” I think 'twas here—though now I know not whether Dead joy or living sorrow be the dream— In this same tent—round which the branches seem To stir their whispering leaves as if to tell The morn the dreadful secret of the Dell— I think 'twas here we lived that life together. (A shape that at one moment seems like a hand, and then a feather of gold, appears in the eastern clouds near the brightening wings of the Spirit of the Sunrise.) My senses mock me: these mad eyes behold What seems a hand, a mystic hand of gold, Traced on the steaming canvas of the mist, Gilding the woof of pearl and amethyst— A hand or golden feather. (Beside the Golden Hand Rhona's face appears.) Is that a picture in a madman's eye? Or is it Memory, like a mocking elf, Weaving Hope's tapestry to cheat herself? Or does great Nature, she who garners all The fleeting pictures Time can limn, recall The face of her the Romanies doomed to die? Or is there glowing a face from brow to chin Where yonder wings of morn are widening thin, Her very face, her throat, her dimpling cheek, Her mouth—the mouth that love first taught to speak— Smiling, “'Tis I, 'tis I”? THE LARK RISING FROM THE HAY-FIELD. Birds of the Dell, the veils of morn are shaking! And see the face of her, ye loving birds, Who knew your songs—who gave them human words In those sweet mornings when her breath would mingle With breath of flowers, and all the dewy Dingle Greeted the Spirit of the Sunrise waking; Ye birds who saw her buried—ye who know But cannot utter where she lies below— Can never tell yon mourner, for the spell The monstrous deed hath cast about the Dell— The man whose heart is breaking! THE BIRDS OF THE DINGLE. She keeps her promise, she who made the vow No Romany law, no Romany guile, should ever Divide their lives, nor Death's fell malice sever The chain the sunrise forged 'twixt her and him; She keeps her promise: see, through mists that swim, Those eyes are hers—that brow is Rhona's brow— Rhona's, who vowed to show the dukkeripen Symbol. Of Hope, the Golden Hand of promise, when Fate should fulfil the prophet-river's warning— Vowed she would gaze from ruby domes of morning; She keeps her promise now. THE SPIRIT OF THE SUNRISE. Though Love be mocked by Death's obscene derision, Love still is Nature's truth and Death her lie; Yet hard it is to see the dear flesh die, To taste the fell destroyer's crowning spite That blasts the soul with life's most cruel sight, Corruption's hand at work in Life's transition: This sight was spared thee: thou shalt still retain Her body's image pictured in thy brain; The flowers above her weave the only shroud Thine eye shall see: no stain of Death shall cloud Rhona! Behold the vision! PERCY. As on that morn when round our bridal pillow The sunrise came and you cried: “Smell the whin!” And oped the tent to let the fragrance in, Yon clouds—like molten metal, boiling brass, Brightening to gold—are crested as they pass With Love's own fire!—And while each gleaming billow Rolls o'er the Dell, 'tis Love's own hand that launches The self-same promise through the self-same branches— The promise of the Sunrise!—Oak and ash And birch and elm and thorn pass on the flash Down to the river-willow! XVII NATURA MALIGNA (Percy, in the Alps, whither he has gone to escape the haunting effect of English scenery upon his mind, has, after living alone in a lonely chalet, passed into a state of spiritual exaltation, and has come to look upon Nature with the puritanical eyes of a Hindoo Saivite, as being the malignant foe of Man. And yet the dominant thought drives him to go every morning to watch for a sign at sunrise.) The Lady of the Hills with crimes untold Followed my feet with azure eyes of prey; By glacier-brink she stood—by cataract-spray— When mists were dire, or avalanche-echoes rolled. At night she glimmered in the death-wind cold, And if a footprint shone at break of day, My flesh would quail, but straight my soul would say: “'Tis hers whose hand God's mightier hand doth hold.” I trod her snow-bridge, for the moon was bright, Her icicle-arch across the sheer crevasse, When lo, she stood! . . . . God made her let me pass, Then felled the bridge! . . . . Oh, there in sallow light, There down the chasm, I saw her cruel, white, And all my wondrous days as in a glass. XVIII THE PROMISE AGAIN RENEWED (Percy's dream in the chalet.) Beneath the loveliest dream there coils a fear: Last night came she whose eyes are memories now; Her far-off gaze seemed all forgetful how Love dimmed them once, so calm they shone and clear. “Sorrow,” I said, “has made me old, my dear; 'Tis I, indeed, but grief can change the brow: Beneath my load a seraph's neck might bow, Vigils like mine would blanch an angel's hair.” Oh, then I saw, I saw the sweet lips move! I saw the love-mists thickening in her eyes— I heard a sound as if a murmuring dove Felt lonely in the dells of Paradise; But when upon my neck she fell, my love, Her hair smelt sweet of whin and woodland spice. XIX NEW YEAR'S EVE IN THE ALPS. (Percy at midnight standing in front of his chalet.) Through Fate's mysterious warp another weft Of days is cast; and, see! Time's star-built throne, From which he greets a new-born year, is shown There where the veil of Alpine clouds is cleft! Old Year, while here I stand, with heart bereft Of all that was its music—stand alone, Remembering happy hours for ever flown, Impatient of the leaden minutes left— The plaudits of mankind that once gave pleasure, The chidings of mankind that once gave pain, Seem in this mountain hut beyond all measure Barren and foolish, and I cry, “No grain, No grain, but winnowings in the harvest sieve!” And yet I cannot join the dead—and live. (The sound of the New Year bells comes up from the valley.) Old Year, what bells are ringing in the New In England, heedless of the knells they ring To you and those whose sorrow makes you cling Each to the other ere you say adieu!— I seem to hear their chimes—the chimes we knew In those dear days when Rhona used to sing, Greeting a New Year's Day as bright of wing As this whose pinions soon will rise to view. If these dream-bells which come and mock mine ears Could bring the past and make it live again, Yea, live with every hour of grief and pain, And hopes deferred and all the grievous fears— And with the past bring her I weep in vain— Then would I bless them, though I blessed in tears. (The clouds move away and show the stars in dazzling brightness over the mountain peaks.) Those stars! they set my rebel-pulses beating Against the tyrant Sorrow, him who drove My footsteps from the Dell and haunted Grove— They bring the mighty Mother's new-year greeting: “All save great Nature is a vision fleeting”— So says the scripture of those orbs above. “All, all,” I cry, “except man's dower of love!— Is Love but born of Nature's mystic cheating?” And yet it comes again, the old desire To read what yonder constellations write On earth's wide mirror—secrets of the night— To feel again the spirit's wondering fire Which, ere this passion came, absorbed me quite, To catch the master-note of Nature's lyre. New Year, the stars do not forget the Old! And yet they say to me, most sorely stung By Fate and Death, “Nature is ever young, Clad in new riches, as each morning's gold Blooms o'er a blasted land: be thou consoled: The Past was great, his harp was greatly strung; The Past was great, his songs were greatly sung; The Past was great, his tales were greatly told; The Past has given to man a wondrous world, But curtains of old Night were being upcurled Whilst thou wast mourning Rhona: things sublime In worlds of worlds were breaking on the sight Of Youth's fresh runners in the lists of Time. Arise, and drink the wine of Nature's light!” XX NATURA BENIGNA (The promise of the sunrise.) What power is this? what witchery wins my feet To peaks so sheer they scorn the cloaking snow, All silent as the emerald gulfs below, Down whose ice-walls the wings of twilight beat? What thrill of earth and heaven—most wild, most sweet— What answering pulse that all the senses know, Comes leaping from the ruddy eastern glow Where, far away, the skies and mountains meet? Mother, 'tis I reborn: I know thee well: That throb I know and all it prophesies, O Mother and Queen, beneath the olden spell Of silence, gazing from thy hills and skies! Dumb Mother, struggling with the years to tell The secret at thy heart through helpless eyes. CHRISTMAS AT THE MERMAID (With the exception of Shakspeare, who has quitted London for good, in order to reside at New Place, Stratford-on-Avon, which he has lately rebuilt, all the members of the Mermaid Club are assembled at the Mermaid Tavern. At the head of the table sits Ben Jonson dealing out the wassail from a large bowl. At the other end sits Raleigh, and at Raleigh's right hand the guest he has brought with him, a stranger, David Gwynn, the Welsh seaman, now an elderly man, whose story of his exploits as a galley-slave in crippling the Armada before it reached the Channel had, years before, whether true or false, given him in the Low Countries a great reputation, the echo of which had reached England. Raleigh's desire was to excite the public enthusiasm for continuing the struggle with Spain on the sea, and generally to revive the fine Elizabethan temper, which had already become almost a thing of the past, save, perhaps, among such choice spirits as those associated with the Mermaid Club.) CHORUS. Christmas knows a merry, merry place, Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? BEN JONSON. (After filling each cup with wassail.) Drink first to Stratford Will—belovèd man, So generous, honest, open, brave and free, Who merriest at the Apollo used to be— Merriest of all the merry Falcon clan. (All drink to “Will Shakspeare.”) CHORUS. Christmas knows a merry, merry place, Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? BEN JONSON. That he, the star of revel, bright-eyed Will, With life at golden summit, fled the town And took from Thames that light to dwindle down O'er Stratford farms, doth make me marvel still. But, tho' we feast without the king to-night, The Monarch leaves a regent—friend of friends, With whose own soul the thronèd spirit blends In one fair flame of love's commingling light. Brother of Shakspeare, wilt thou not rehearse Those sugared sonnets thy shy muse hath made, Those lines where Avon, glassing wood and glade, Seems rippling through the sunshine of thy verse? Wilt thou not tell the Mermaid once again, In golden numbers, what the poet told, Of how his spirit ever was controlled By Avon-ripples shining in his brain, And how those ripples greeted him that day, Which was the Mermaid's night, when he the Swan Flew to the bosom he was nursed upon— The bosom he so loved when far away? Wilt thou not tell us how the river spake To that sweet Swan returning to its nest Among the lilies dreaming on the breast Of Avon, dear to us for Shakspeare's sake? CHORUS. Christmas knows a merry, merry place, Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? SHAKSPEARE'S FRIEND. To sing the nation's song or do the deed That crowns with richer light the motherland, Or lend her strength of arm in hour of need When fangs of foes shine fierce on every hand, Is joy to him whose joy is working well— Is goal and guerdon too, though never fame Should find a thrill of music in his name; Yea, goal and guerdon too, though Scorn should aim Her arrows at his soul's high citadel. But if the fates withhold the joy from me To do the deed that widens England's day. Or join that song of Freedom's jubilee Begun when England started on her way— Withhold from me the hero's glorious power To strike with song or sword for her, the mother, And give that sacred guerdon to another, Him will I hail as my more noble brother— Him will I love for his diviner dower. Enough for me who have our Shakspeare's love To see a poet win the poet's goal, For Will is he; enough and far above All other prizes to make rich my soul. Ben names my numbers golden. Since they tell A tale of him who in his peerless prime Fled us ere yet one shadowy film of time Could dim the lustre of that brow sublime, Golden my numbers are: Ben praiseth well. THE EVENING AFTER WILL'S RETURN TO STRATFORD-ON-AVON As down the bank he strolled through evening dew, Pictures (he told me) of remembered eves Mixt with that dream the Avon ever weaves, And all his happy childhood came to view; He saw a child watching the birds that flew Above a willow, through whose musky leaves A green musk-beetle shone with mail and greaves That shifted in the light to bronze and blue. These dreams, said he, were born of fragrance falling From trees he loved, the scent of musk recalling, With power beyond all power of things beholden Or things reheard, those days when elves of dusk Came, veiled the wings of evening feathered golden, And closed him in from all but willow musk. And then a child beneath a silver sallow— A child who loved the swans, the moorhens' “cheep”— Angled for bream where river holes were deep— For gudgeon where the water glittered shallow, Or ate the “fairy cheeses” of the mallow, And wild fruits gathered where the wavelets creep Round that loved church whose shadow seems to sleep In love upon the stream and bless and hallow; And then a child to whom the water-fairies Sent fish to “bite” from Avon's holes and shelves, A child to whom, from richest honey-dairies, The flower-sprites sent the bees and “sunshine elves;” Then, in the shifting vision's sweet vagaries, He saw two lovers walking by themselves— Walking beneath the trees, where drops of rain Wove crowns of sunlit opal to decoy Young love from home; and one, the happy boy, Knew all the thoughts of birds in every strain— Knew why the cushat breaks his fond refrain By sudden silence, “lest his plaint should cloy”— Knew when the skylark's changing note of joy Saith, “Now will I return to earth again”— Knew every warning of the blackbird's shriek, And every promise of his joyful song— Knew what the magpie's chuckle fain would speak; And, when a silent cuckoo flew along, Bearing an egg in her felonious beak, Knew every nest threatened with grievous wrong. He heard her say, “The birds attest our troth! Hark to the mavis, Will, in yonder may Fringing the sward, where many a hawthorn spray Round summer's royal field of golden cloth Shines o'er the buttercups like snowy froth, And that sweet skylark on his azure way, And that wise cuckoo, hark to what they say: ‘We birds of Avon heard and bless you both.’ And, Will, the sunrise, flushing with its glory River and church, grows rosier with our story! This breeze of morn, sweetheart, which moves caressing, Hath told the flowers; they wake to lovelier growth! They breathe—o'er mead and stream they breathe—the blessing, ‘We flowers of Avon heard and bless you both!’” A FRIEND OF MARLOWE'S. (Who has been sitting moody and silent.) 'Tis when the Christmas joy-bells fill the air That memory comes with half-reproachful eyes To hold before the soul its legacies, Of grief and joy from Christmas-songs that were. Friends, friends, there come to me, I know not why, The words I wrote that day my Kit was slain. I would not chill this feast, yet am I fain To tell of Kit and how I saw him die. ON SEEING KIT MARLOWE SLAIN AT DEPTFORD 'Tis Marlowe falls! That last lunge rent asunder Our lyre of spirit and flesh, Kit Marlowe's life, Whose chords seemed strung by earth and heav'n at strife, Yet ever strung to beauty above or under! Heav'n kens of Man, but oh! the stars can blunder, If Fate's hand guided yonder villain's knife Through that rare brain, so teeming, daring, rife With dower of poets—song and love and wonder. Or was it Chance? Shakspeare, who art supreme O'er man and men, yet sharest Marlowe's sight To pierce the clouds that hide the inhuman height Where man and men and gods and all that seem Are Nature's mutterings in her changeful dream— Come, spell the runes these bloody rivulets write! (They drink in silence to the memory of Marlowe.) MARLOWE'S FRIEND. Where'er thou art, “dead Shepherd,” look on me; The boy who loved thee loves more dearly now, He sees thine eyes in yonder holly-bough; Oh, Kit, my Kit, the Mermaid drinks to thee! RALEIGH. (Turning to David Gwynn.) Wherever billows foam The Briton fights at home: His hearth is built of water— CHORUS. Water blue and green; RALEIGH. There's never a wave of ocean The wind can set in motion That shall not own our England— CHORUS. Own our England queen. RALEIGH. The guest I bring to-night Had many a goodly fight On seas the Don hath found— CHORUS. Hath found for English sails; RALEIGH. And once he dealt a blow Against the Don to show What mighty hearts can move— CHORUS. Can move in leafy Wales. RALEIGH. Stand up, bold Master Gwynn, Who hast a heart akin To England's own brave hearts— CHORUS. Brave hearts where'er they beat; RALEIGH. Stand up, brave Welshman, thou, And tell the Mermaid how A galley-slave struck hard— CHORUS. Struck hard the Spanish fleet. Christmas knows a merry, merry place, Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? DAVID GWYNN'S STORY OF HOW HE AND THE GOLDEN SKELETON CRIPPLED THE GREAT ARMADA SAILING OUT “A galley lie” they called my tale; but he Whose talk is with the deep kens mighty tales. The man, I say, who helped to keep you free Stands here, a truthful son of truthful Wales. Slandered by England as a loose-lipped liar, Banished from Ireland, branded rogue and thief, Here stands that Gwynn whose life of torments dire Heaven sealed for England, sealed in blood and fire— Stands asking here Truth's one reward, belief! And Spain shall tell, with pallid lips of dread, This tale of mine—shall tell, in future days, How Gwynn, the galley-slave, once fought and bled For England when she moved in perilous ways; But say, ye gentlemen of England, sprung From loins of men whose ghosts have still the sea— Doth England—she who loves the loudest tongue— Remember mariners whose deeds are sung By waves where flowed their blood to keep her free? I see—I see ev'n now—those ships of Spain Gathered in Tagus' mouth to make the spring; I feel the cursèd oar, I toil again, And trumpets blare, and priests and choir-boys sing; And morning strikes with many a crimson shaft, Through ruddy haze, four galleys rowing out— Four galleys built to pierce the English craft, Each swivel-gunned for raking fore and aft, Snouted like sword-fish, but with iron snout. And one we call the Princess, one the Royal, Diana one; but 'tis the fell Basana Where I am toiling, Gwynn, the true, the loyal, Thinking of mighty Drake and Gloriana; For by their help Hope whispers me that I— Whom ten hours' daily travail at a stretch Has taught how sweet a thing it is to die— May strike once more where flags of England fly, Strike for myself and many a haggard wretch. True sorrow knows a tale it may not tell: Again I feel the lash that tears my back; Again I hear mine own blaspheming yell, Answered by boatswain's laugh and scourge's crack; Again I feel the pang when trying to choke Rather than drink the wine, or chew the bread Wherewith, when rest for meals would break the stroke, They cram our mouths while still we sit at yoke; Again is Life, not Death, the shape of dread. By Finisterre there comes a sudden gale, And mighty waves assault our trembling galley With blows that strike her waist as strikes a flail, And soldiers cry, “What saint shall bid her rally?” Some slaves refuse to row, and some implore The Dons to free them from the metal tether By which their limbs are locked upon the oar; Some shout, in answer to the billows' roar, “The Dons and we will drink brine-wine together.” “Bring up the slave,” I hear the captain cry, “Who sank the golden galleon El Dorado. The dog can steer.” “Here sits the dog,” quoth I, “Who sank the ship of Commodore Medrado!” With hell-lit eyes, blistered by spray and rain, Standing upon the bridge, saith he to me: “Hearken, thou pirate—bold Medrado's bane!— Freedom and gold are thine, and thanks of Spain. If thou canst take the galley through this sea.” “Ay! ay!” quoth I. The fools unlock me straight! And then 'tis I give orders to the Don, Laughing within to hear the laugh of Fate, Whose winning game I know hath just begun. I mount the bridge when dies the last red streak Of evening, and the moon seems fain for night. Oh then I see beneath the galley's beak A glow like Spanish auto's ruddy reek— Oh then these eyes behold a wondrous sight! A skeleton, but yet with living eyes— A skeleton, but yet with bones like gold— Squats on the galley-beak, in wondrous wise, And round his brow, of high imperial mould, A burning circle seems to shake and shine, Bright, fiery bright, with many a living gem, Throwing a radiance o'er the foam-lit brine: “'Tis God's Revenge,” methinks. “Heaven sends for sign That bony shape—that Inca's diadem.” At first the sign is only seen of me, But well I know that God's Revenge hath come To strike the Armada, set old ocean free, And cleanse from stain of Spain the beauteous foam. Quoth I, “How fierce soever be the levin Spain's hand can hurl—made mightier still for wrong By that great Scarlet One whose hills are seven— Yea, howsoever Hell may scoff at Heaven— Stronger than Hell is God, though Hell is strong.” “The dog can steer,” I laugh; “yea, Drake's men know How sea-dogs hold a ship to Biscay waves.” Ah! when I bid the soldiers go below, Some 'neath the hatches, some beside the slaves, And bid them stack their muskets all in piles Beside the foremast, covered by a sail. The captives guess my plan—I see their smiles As down the waist the cozened troop defiles, Staggering and stumbling landsmen, faint and pale. I say, they guess my plan—to send beneath The soldiers to the benches where the slaves Sit, armed with eager nails and eager teeth— Hate's nails and teeth more keen than Spanish glaives, Then wait until the tempest's waxing might Shall reach its fiercest, mingling sea and sky, Then seize the key, unlock the slaves, and smite The sea-sick soldiers in their helpless plight, Then bid the Spaniards pull at oar or die. Past Ferrol Bay each galley 'gins to stoop, Shuddering before the Biscay demon's breath. Down goes a prow—down goes a gaudy poop: “The Don's Diana bears the Don to death, Quoth I, “and see the Princess plunge and wallow Down purple trough, o'er snowy crest of foam: See! see! the Royal, how she tries to follow By many a glimmering crest and shimmering hollow, Where gull and petrel scarcely dare to roam.” Now three queen-galleys pass Cape Finisterre; The Armada, dreaming but of ocean-storms, Thinks not of mutineers with shoulders bare, Chained, bloody-wealed and pale, on galley-forms, Each rower murmuring o'er my whispered plan, Deep-burnt within his brain in words of fire, “Rise, every man, to tear to death his man— Yea, tear as only galley-captives can, When God's Revenge sings loud to ocean's lyre.” Taller the spectre grows 'mid ocean's din; The captain sees the Skeleton and pales: I give the sign: the slaves cry, “Ho for Gwynn!” “Teach them,” quoth I, “the way we grip in Wales.” And, leaping down where hateful boatswains shake, I win the key—let loose a storm of slaves: “When captives hold the whip, let drivers quake,” They cry; “sit down, ye Dons, and row for Drake, Or drink to England's Queen in foaming waves.” We leap adown the hatches; in the dark We stab the Dons at random, till I see A spark that trembles like a tinder-spark, Waxing and brightening, till it seems to be A fleshless skull, with eyes of joyful fire: Then, lo! a bony shape with lifted hands— A bony mouth that chants an anthem dire, O'ertopping groans, o'ertopping Ocean's quire— A skeleton with Inca's diadem stands! It sings the song I heard an Indian sing, Chained by the ruthless Dons to burn at stake, When priests of Tophet chanted in a ring, Sniffing man's flesh at roast for Christ His sake. The Spaniards hear: they see: they fight no more; They cross their foreheads, but they dare not speak. Anon the spectre, when the strife is o'er, Melts from the dark, then glimmers as before, Burning upon the conquered galley's beak. And now the moon breaks through the night, and shows The Royal bearing down upon our craft— Then comes a broadside close at hand, which strows Our deck with bleeding bodies fore and aft. I take the helm; I put the galley near: We grapple in silver sheen of moonlit surge. Amid the Royal's din I laugh to hear The curse of many a British mutineer, The crack, crack, crack of boatswain's biting scourge. “Ye scourge in vain,” quoth I, “scourging for life Slaves who shall row no more to save the Don;” For from the Royal's poop, above the strife Their captain gazes at our Skeleton! “What! is it thou, Pirate of El Dorado?” He shouts in English tongue. And there, behold! Stands he, the devil's commodore, Medrado. “Ay! ay!” quoth I, “Spain owes me one strappado For scuttling Philip's ship of stolen gold. “I come for that strappado now,” quoth I. “What means yon thing of burning bones?” he saith. “'Tis God's Revenge cries, ‘Bloody Spain shall die!’ The king of El Dorado's name is Death. Strike home, ye slaves; your hour is coming swift,” I cry; “strong hands are stretched to save you now; Show yonder spectre you are worth the gift.” But when the Royal, captured, rides adrift, I look: the skeleton hath left our prow. When all are slain, the tempest's wings have fled, But still the sea is dreaming of the storm: Far down the offing glows a spot of red, My soul knows well it hath that Inca's form. “It lights,” quoth I, “the red cross banner of Spain There on the flagship where Medina sleeps— Hell's banner, wet with sweat of Indians' pain, And tears of women yoked to treasure train, Scarlet of blood for which the New World weeps. There on the dark the flagship of the Don To me seems luminous of the spectre's glow; But soon an arc of gold, and then the Sun, Rise o'er the reddening billows, proud and slow; Then, through the curtains of the morning mist, That take all shifting colours as they shake, I see the great Armada coil and twist Miles, miles along the ocean's amethyst, Like hell's old snake of hate—the wingèd snake. And, when the hazy veils of Morn are thinned, That snake accursed, with wings which swell and puff Before the slackening horses of the wind, Turns into shining ships that tack and luff. “Behold,” quoth I, “their floating citadels, The same the priests have vouched for musket-proof, Caracks and hulks and nimble caravels, That sailed with us to sound of Lisbon bells— Yea, sailed from Tagus mouth, for Christ's behoof. For Christ's behoof they sailed: see how they go With that red skeleton to show the way There sitting on Medina's stem aglow— A hundred sail and forty-nine, men say; Behold them, brothers, galleon and galeasse— Their dizened turrets bright of many a plume, Their gilded poops, their shining guns of brass, Their trucks, their flags—behold them, how they pass— With God's Revenge for figurehead—to Doom!” BEN JONSON. Now drink to Drake and drink to those Who when they saw through evening's purple veils Two far-divided points that rose— Two crescent horns that brightened into sails— Laughed—though methinks their laugh was grim— Laughed when those horns like evening's pinion tips Burnt ruddier, and the centre dim Came up and filled the horizon's rim— Laughed loud and cried: “See how the pirzes swim, Our Spanish ships”— The men who saw the Armada float, And lit the beacon fires to spread the news, While smack, and hoy, and fishing boat Swelled big with pride, and landsmen joined the crews. Papist like Lutheran met with laughter The ban of Rome—Drink to those Papist halls That rang with shouts from rush to rafter, “Whate'er the bans the winds may waft her, England's true men are we and Pope's men after, When England calls.” DRAYTON. Fill every cup with Mermaid-sack, And sing a song of Drake and Howard's men, Who broke the Spanish Bloodhound's back In England's glorious week of triumph, when Her fate, which aye was Freedom's fate, Hung on the sons she suckled to be free— When down before them in the Strait Went that fell flag the free waves hate, And God said: “England, this is thine estate! And gave the sea. CHORUS. The sea! Thus did England fight; And shall not England smite With Drake's strong stroke in battles yet to be? He who alive to them a Dragon was Shalbe a Dragon unto them againe, For with his death his terrour shall not passe, But still amid the aire he shall remaine. Sir Francis Drake, by Charles Fitzgeoffrey Oxford, 1596. And while the winds have power Shall England lose the dower She won in that great hour— The sea? BEN JONSON. (Turning to Raleigh.) To win the Theban prize, each brought his lay, When, lo! a stranger stood, wind-flushed and tanned, Who sang of marvellous sights in many a land And voices heard on waters far away. But fools shall give to fools the bay for prize, Yea, though Apollo's self hath brought an ode: And songs are sung in Time's forgotten mode When high gods sing from still-receding skies. The bard whose song the Thebans might not follow. Because he sang of more than Theban things, Was he whose music, struck from Nature's strings, Builded the walls of Ilion, great Apollo. Cried Phœbus, soaring high—his bright feet shod With Day that quenched the day and hid the town— “Ye spurn Apollo as a sunburnt clown, Ye pallid priestlings of a sunburnt god! “The milk-white forehead, tender and dainty-skinned, Your sculptors give me—lips too fine to quaff The wine of morning—make Olympus laugh: Gods know the sun-god bronzed by brine and wind.” The Mermaid, “Ocean-shepherd,” drinks to thee: Sunburnt thou art, and knowest the great round world, As Phœbus knows: tell us how England hurled Spain to the bottom of the guardian sea. CHORUS. Christmas knows a merry, merry place, Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? Raleigh. Hail the wassail-steam that rises Above the head of him who brewed it, Ben. Rare shapes it takes and wondrous guises Of ships, and flags, and guns, and fighting men. The Mermaid's spicy steam to-night Brings back the curling clouds of other smoke— Less dainty of scent, less pure and white, Yet sweet and full of high delight To me who saw how English sailors fight On English oak. I feel the west wind blowing in, And, when out-warps the fleet of every sail, I hear Drake say, “'Twill soon begin, The game between the sword-fish and the whale”— Hear Wynter say: “Those galleons towered, With Philip's trinkets, Philip's filigree, And painted trucks and pennons flowered, Shall feel the stroke of England's Howard, And touch the ships of Drake whose keels have scoured Philip's own sea.” CHORUS. The sea! Thus did England fight; And shall not England smite With Drake's strong stroke in battles yet to be? And while the winds have power Shall England lose the dower She won in that great hour— The sea? RALEIGH. Out-warp the ships the Spaniards knew Ere Drake returned from “singeing Philip's beard,” With flags that under Cadiz flew When right between the Spanish keels he steered; Out-warp the ships John Hawkins made— Hornets for golden bees from El Dorado— With keels as fine as rapier-blade, Slipping to follow or evade As swiftly through a Spanish cannonade As sea-gull's shadow. Off Plymouth Sound the Sabbath smiles When whale and swordfish meet in deadly play— When up the Channel, miles on miles, The swordfish stabs and stabs and glides away. The Spaniard hath both sail and oar. And what hath England? Sons who strike with glee To music of the cannon's roar— Strike, strike till e'en the rooks on shore Rise scared, and Channel sea-fowls wheel and soar Right out to sea. CHORUS. The sea! Thus did England fight; And shall not England smite With Drake's strong stroke in battles yet to be? And while the winds have power Shall England lose the dower She won in that great hour— The sea? RALEIGH. And now from bays and creeks and coves, Through all the sacred ways, from farthest Scillies To that sweet bay where whispering groves Stretch on to many a lawn of Jersey lilies! From Lyme to that flower-fragrant home Of nightingale and rose, beloved Wight, They come—in smacks, in skiffs they come— And even in little shallops some— To show how foes who brave our Channel-foam Will have to fight. When, like a playful hound released, From purple portals of the opening day At last the wind from out the east Drives smoke and vapour over Weymouth Bay, Medina hath the wind, he sees, And bears on Howard's line with luckless might; And Drake knows well the Narrow Seas That nurtured him—knows how the breeze Of summer follows all the sun's decrees From dawn till night. At last Medina finds his goal, And, safe as hunted wolf within his lair, He anchors close by Calais shoal, While England's sea-dogs fret around him there. “Damned be the foe who will not fight!” Saith Wynter. “List, my Lord High Admiral; Beneath yon moon a-shining bright There lies the Don in direst plight, With riddled hulls and sails—with men in fright, But fight he shall. “O' nights, my lord, the tide sets down To where yon gaudy-bellied gold-tubs lie So close they seem like Plymouth town Save for the lanterns swaying there on high. When midnight sounds by Spanish bells, To-morrow night, before the moon shines free, Send fire-ships round their caravels, Their clumsy galleon-citadels; The Don will deem them ‘Antwerp's floating hells’ That turn on sea.” CHORUS. The sea! Thus did England fight: And shall not England smite With Drake strong stroke in battles yet to be? And while the winds have power Shall England lose the dower She won in that great hour— The sea? RALEIGH. The midnight bells! I hear them rung! In strength the Spaniard sleeps, but battle-thinned; No dreams hath he of Prowse and Young, There stealing with the fire-ships down the wind, Till smoke up-curls and flames devour And Night's black wings are glowing like fiery pinions, Which wax in light and wax in power, Illuming Gravelines wakened tower With sparks and flakes that seem a ruddy shower From hell's dominions. Troops, priests, and sailors dance with dread, As dance bewildered steeds in burning stables; Sails open in the reeking red: The Fleet Invincible hath slipped its cables! “The Antwerp fire! the floating mine!” The Spaniards shout. But now there comes to me A sign I know, the Channel's sign— A sound most like the sleuth hound's whine When slot is found: Drake knows that cry divine: 'Tis England's sea! CHORUS. The sea! Thus did England fight: And shall not England smite With Drake's strong stroke in battles yet to be? And while the winds have power Shall England lose the dower She won in that great hour— The sea? RALEIGH. Six miles from shore lies trembling Spain, Yearning for Calais Roads and Flushing sands; But Drake hath said, “Never again Shall Parma with the Golden Duke shake hands.” The south-west wind has never shifted, And there, while morning opes bewildered eyes, While Spain lies shattered, scattered, drifted, With hulls and sails the balls have rifted, Both warring fleets as by a hand are lifted— Our billows rise! While morning gazes o'er the waves, Gilding the ships, the Spaniards sallow-skinned, The cruel oars, the weary slaves, Drake starts: “What signs are these on sea and wind?” He knows what glorious combatant Is moving now to hold our England free; He knows our Channel's covenant With Freedom—knows how billows pant, Ere yet begins the Channel's English chant Of wind and sea. CHORUS. The sea! Thus did England fight; And shall not England smite With Drake's strong stroke in battles yet to be? And while the winds have power Shall England lose the dower She won in that great hour— The sea? RALEIGH. The choirboys sing the matin song, When down falls Seymour on the Spaniard's right. He drives the wing—a huddled throng— Back on the centre ships, that steer for flight. While galleon hurtles galeasse, And oars that fight each other kill the slaves, As scythes cut down the summer grass, Drake closes on the writhing mass, Through which the balls at closest ranges pass, Skimming the waves. Fiercely do galley and galeasse fight, Running from ship to ship like living things. With oars like legs, with beaks that smite, Winged centipedes they seem with tattered wings. Through smoke we see their chiefs encased In shining mail of gold where blood congeals; And once I see within a waist Wild English captives ashen-faced, Their bending backs by Spanish scourges laced In purple weals. (David Gwynn here leaps up, pale and panting, and bares a scarred arm, but at a sign from Raleigh sits down again.) The Don fights well, but fights not now The cozened Indian whom he kissed for friend, To pluck the gold from off the brow, Then fling the flesh to priests to burn and rend. He hunts not now the Indian maid With bloodhound's bay—Peru's confiding daughter, Who saw in flowery bower or glade The stranger's god-like cavalcade, And worshipped, while he planned Pizarro's trade Of rape and slaughter. His fight is now with Drake and Wynter, Hawkins, and Frobisher, and English fire, Bullet and cannon ball and splinter, Till every deck gleams, greased with bloody mire: Heaven smiles to see that battle wage, Close battle of musket, carabine, and gun: Oh, vainly doth the Spaniard rage Like any wolf that tears his cage! 'Tis English sails shall win the weather gauge Till set of sun! Their troops, superfluous as their gold, Out-numbering all their seamen two to one, Are packed away in every hold— Targets of flesh for every English gun— Till, like Pizarro's halls of blood, Or slaughter-pens where swine or beeves are pinned, Lee-scuppers pour a crimson flood, Reddening the waves for many a rood, As eastward, eastward still the galleons scud Before the wind. “Doth mighty Parma wait to join The ‘deathless fleet’ that holds four thousand dead? That fleet shall never turn the Groyne If cannon-gear be ours and sailors' bread.” As thus he speaks brave Cumberland Sweeps down to set the crown on Victory; While privateers on every hand Are flocking, flocking, from the land, To drive out Philip's Pope-anointed band To the open sea. CHORUS. The sea! Thus did England fight; And shall not England smite With Drake's strong stroke in battles yet to be? And while the winds have power Shall England lose the dower She won in that great hour— The sea? BEN JONSON. (At the conclusion of Raleigh's song.) Sweet is the song of victories Which only leaves the singer's deed unsung. (He stops, having perceived that Gwynn, who has been following Raleigh's story with intense excitement, has now passed into a condition resembling hysteria, staring into the air and pulling open his dress to display scars of the branding iron and of the boatswain's galley-scourge.) Look to thy friend! Before his eyes What ghostly picture in the air is hung? LODGE. Good Master Gwynn, we pray thee tell The Mermaid what hath blanched thy lips and brow. DEKKER. Some sight he sees of Death or Hell. CHAPMAN. We marvel, friend, what mighty spell, Making each vein upon thy forehead swell, Hath seized thee now. GWYNN. With towering sterns, with golden stems That totter in the smoke before their foe, I see them pass the mouth of Thames, With death above the billows, death below! Who leads them down the tempest's path, From Thames to Yare, from Yare to Tweed-mouth blown, Past many a Scottish hill and strath, All helpless in the wild wind's wrath, Each mainmast stooping, creaking like a lath? The Skeleton! At length with toil the cape is passed, And faster and faster still the billows come To coil and boil till every mast Is flecked with clinging flakes of snowy foam. I see, I see, where galleons pitch, That Inca's bony shape burn on the waves, Flushing each emerald scarp and ditch, While Mother Carey, Orkney's witch, Waves to the Spectre's song her lantern-switch O'er ocean-graves. The glimmering crown of Scotland's head They pass. No foe dares follow but the storm. The Spectre, like a sunset red, Illumines mighty Wrath's defiant form, And makes the dreadful granite peak Burn o'er the ships with brows of prophecy; Yea, makes that silent countenance speak Above the tempest's foam and reek, More loud than all the loudest winds that shriek, “Tyrants, ye die!” The Spectre, by the Orkney Isles, Writes “God's Revenge” on waves that climb and dash, Foaming right up the sand-built piles, Where ships are hurled. It sings amid the crash; Yea, sings amid the tempest's roar, Snapping of ropes, cracking of spars set free, And yells of captives chained to oar, And cries of those who strike for shore, “Spain's murderous breath of blood shall foul no more The righteous sea!” BEN JONSON. So lists the Mermaid to the sailor's song, “So lists the sailor to the mermaid's song.” —Arden of Feversham. But let not wassail cool on Christmas Eve: The hero's tale being told, why, let us leave For merrier themes the fight of Right with Wrong. WASSAIL CHORUS. CHORUS. Christmas knows a merry, merry place, Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? RALEIGH. 'Tis by Devon's glorious halls, Whence, dear Ben, I come again: Bright with golden roofs and walls— El Dorado's rare domain— Seem those halls when sunlight launches Shafts of gold through leafless branches, Where the winter's feathery mantle blanches Field and farm and lane. CHORUS. Christmas knows a merry, merry place. Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? DRAYTON. 'Tis where Avon's wood-sprites weave Through the boughs a lace of rime, While the bells of Christmas Eve Fling for Will the Stratford-chime O'er the river-flags embossed Rich with flowery runes of frost— O'er the meads where snowy tufts are tossed— Strains of olden time. CHORUS. Christmas knows a merry, merry place, Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? SHAKSPEARE'S FRIEND. 'Tis, methinks, on any ground Where our Shakspeare's feet are set. There smiles Christmas, holly-crowned With his blithest coronet: Friendship's face he loveth well: 'Tis a countenance whose spell Sheds a balm o'er every mead and dell Where we used to fret. CHORUS. Christmas knows a merry, merry place, Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? HEYWOOD. More than all the pictures, Ben, Winter weaves by wood or stream, Christmas loves our London, when Rise thy clouds of wassail-steam— Clouds like these, that, curling, take Forms of faces gone, and wake Many a lay from lips we loved, and make London like a dream. CHORUS. Christmas knows a merry, merry place, Where he goes with fondest face, Brightest eye, brightest hair: Tell the Mermaid where is that one place: Where? BEN JONSON. Love's old songs shall never die, Yet the new shall suffer proof; Love's old drink of Yule brew I, Wassail for new love's behoof: Drink the drink I brew, and sing Till the berried branches swing, Till our song make all the Mermaid ring— Yea, from rush to roof. FINALE. Christmas loves this merry, merry place:— Christmas saith with fondest face Brightest eye, brightest hair: “Ben! the drink tastes rare of sack and mace: Rare!” A TALK ON WATERLOO BRIDGE THE LAST SIGHT OF GEORGE BORROW We talked of “Children of the Open Air,” Who once on hill and valley lived aloof, Loving the sun, the wind, the sweet reproof Of storms, and all that makes the fair earth fair, Till, on a day across the mystic bar Of moonrise, came the “Children of the Roof,” Who find no balm 'neath evening's rosiest woof, Nor dews of peace beneath the Morning Star We looked o'er London, where men wither and choke, Roofed in, poor souls, renouncing stars and skies, And lore of woods and wild wind prophecies, Yea, every voice that to their fathers spoke: And sweet it seemed to die ere bricks and smoke Leave never a meadow outside Paradise. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS A DEAD POET Thou knewest that island, far away and lone, Whose shores are as a harp, where billows break In spray of music and the breezes shake O'er spicy seas a woof of colour and tone, While that sweet music echoes like a moan In the island's heart, and sighs around the lake, Where, watching fearfully a watchful snake, A damsel weeps upon her emerald throne. Life's ocean, breaking round thy senses' shore, Struck golden song, as from the strand of Day: For us the joy, for thee the fell foe lay— Pain's blinking snake around the fair isle's core, Turning to sighs the enchanted sounds that play Around thy lovely island evermore. A GRAVE BY THE SEA I Yon sightless poet Philip Bourke Marston. whom thou leav'st behind, Sightless and trembling like a storm-struck tree, Above the grave he feels but cannot see, Save with the vision Sorrow lends the mind, Is he indeed the loneliest of mankind? Ah no!—For all his sobs, he seems to me Less lonely standing there, and nearer thee, Than I—less lonely, nearer—standing blind! Free from the day, and piercing Life's disguise That needs must partly enveil true heart from heart, His inner eyes may see thee as thou art In Memory's land—see thee beneath the skies Lit by thy brow—by those beloved eyes, While I stand by him in a world apart, II I stand like her who on the glittering Rhine Saw that strange swan which drew a faëry boat Where shone a knight whose radiant forehead smote Her soul with light and made her blue eyes shine For many a day with sights that seemed divine, Till that false swan returned and arched his throat In pride, and called him, and she saw him float Adown the stream: I stand like her and pine. I stand like her, for she, and only she, Might know my loneliness for want of thee. Light swam into her soul, she asked not whence, Filled it with joy no clouds of life could smother. And then, departing like a vision thence, Left her more lonely than the blind, my brother. III Last night Death whispered: “Death is but the name Man gives the Power which lends him life and light, And then, returning past the coast of night, Takes what it lent to shores from whence it came.” What balm in knowing the dark doth but reclaim The sun it lent, if day hath taken flight? Art thou not vanished—vanished from my sight— Though somewhere shining, vanished all the same? With Nature dumb, save for the billows' moan, Engirt by men I love, yet desolate— Standing with brothers here, yet dazed and lone, King'd by my sorrow, made by grief so great That man's voice murmurs like an insect's drone— What balm, I ask, in knowing that Death is Fate? IV Last night Death whispered: “Life's purblind procession, Flickering with blazon of the human story— Time's fen-flame over Death's dark territory— Will leave no trail, no sign of Life's aggression. Yon moon that strikes the pane, the stars in session, Are weak as Man they mock with fleeting glory. Since Life is only Death's frail feudatory, How shall love hold of Fate in true possession?” I answered thus: “If Friendship's isle of palm Is but a vision, every loveliest leaf, Can knowledge of its mockery soothe and calm This soul of mine in this most fiery grief? If Love but holds of Life through Death in fief, What balm in knowing that Love is Death's—what balm? V Yea, thus I boldly answered Death—even I Who have for boon—who have for deathless dower— Thy love, dear friend, which broods, a magic power, Filling with music earth and sea and sky: “O Death,” I said, “not Love, but thou shalt die; For, this I know, though thine is now the hour, And thine these angry clouds of doom that lour, Death striking Love but strikes to deify.” Yet while I spoke I sighed in loneliness, For strange seemed Man, and Life seemed comfortless, And night, whom we two loved, seemed strange and dumb; And, waiting till the dawn the promised sign, I watched—I listened for that voice of thine, Though Reason said: “Nor voice nor face can come.” Birchington, Eastertide 1882. THE OMNIPOTENCE OF LOVE I THE SLAVE GIRL'S PROGRESS TO PARADISE Although the Koran refers three times to the wives of the just accompanying them into Paradise (Sura xiii. 36–42), and although there is a tradition of a Paradise apart from the men reserved for the few women whom Mohammed did not see in his vision of perdition, the popular notion in some Mohammedan countries is that women have no souls to be either blessed or damned. (Beneath the cypress overhanging her lover's tomb the slave girl lies stretched on the stone. In the shadow by the tree are seen the “wide black eyes” and the sombre wings of Azraeel, the Angel of Death.) THE SLAVE GIRL. Angel of Death! Hearken in yonder wood How turtle and nightingale are murmuring “Pity”; “Pity,” yon slave-girls moan who brought me food And milk and shawls, to soothe my solitude: See how they weep, returning to the city. (Ilyàs the Prophet, who is passing the tomb, stops to listen.) ILYÀS. What sorrow, child, hath made thee fain to die? THE SLAVE GIRL. I would not die: this frame of mine remembers Each touch of his which gave it sanctity, Flickering within the body's memory, As come and go the sparks in slumbering embers. Save me from Azraeel—him whose sword divides Love's dearest bonds—whose malice struck to sever My life from one who loves me, though he bides Where never slave girl stood, with houri brides. I would not die, but live and weep for ever. ILYÀS TO AZRAEEL. Yea, Love is strong! This child would spend her days Here on this tomb with cypress boughs for cover, While travellers whisper as they stop and gaze Across the graveyard, “See how love can craze! She lives upon the tomb where sleeps her lover.” THE SLAVE GIRL. Death knows I have no soul, and never more Those lips shall touch the widowed lips that quiver With memories of the light which once they wore. Death knows I have no soul with wings to soar To one who stands beside the Holy river. (A spirit resembling the slave girl herself in form and feature, but winged like a Peri, descends from the sunset clouds, leaving an iridescent track behind it.) ILYÀS TO AZRAEEL. Lo! Allah sends a vision down the air That leaves a rainbow track o'er thy dominions. THE SLAVE GIRL. What shape is that which treads the Peris' stair? It stands beside me now with shining hair, I breathe the musk of Aidenn from its pinions. ILYÀS. No soulless Peri this whose eyes illume With mirrored radiance of a deathless glory The cypress branches round thy lover's tomb, And flush the vans of Death with such a bloom That Evening's rosy wings seem wan and hoary. THE SLAVE GIRL TO THE VISION. Spirit, whose tears are falling on the stone, Doth sorrow stamp an angel's forehead human? Thou speakest not, but as a sight half known, Within a dream, thy face seems like mine own, And eyes that weep must needs be kin to woman. AZRAEEL. Thy lover waiteth by the Holy Lote. THE SLAVE GIRL. With houris? AZRAEEL. Nay, he loveth still a maiden. THE SLAVE GIRL. That maiden hath no soul to ford the moat. ILYÀS. Thou'rt loved of Allah! THE SLAVE GIRL. Yet his servant smote Him whom the houris dare not clasp in Aidenn. (The spirit stoops and kisses the slave girl's forehead.) ILYÀS. I think the spirit's kiss upon thy brow Seals Allah's promise of a blissful morrow. THE SLAVE GIRL TO THE VISION. Morrow for me! Speak, spirit, who art thou? ILYÀS. 'Tis thine own soul—the spirit with thee now Is thine own soul new-lit by love and sorrow. II THE BEDOUIN-CHILD (From “Aylwin”) (Among the Bedouins a father in enumerating his children never counts his daughters, for a daughter is considered a disgrace.) Ilyàs the prophet, lingering 'neath the moon, Heard from a tent a child's heart-withering wail, Mixt with the message of the nightingale, And, entering, found, sunk in mysterious swoon, A little maiden dreaming there alone. She babbled of her father sitting pale 'Neath wings of Death—'mid sights of sorrow and bale, And pleaded for his life in piteous tone. “Poor child, plead on,” the succouring prophet saith, While she, with eager lips, like one who tries To kiss a dream, stretches her arms and cries To Heaven for help—“Plead on: such pure love-breath. Reaching the Throne, might stay the wings of Death That, in the Desert, fan thy father's eyes.” The drouth-slain camels lie on every hand; Seven sons await the morning vultures' claws; 'Mid empty water-skins and camel-maws The father sits, the last of all the band. He mutters, drowsing o'er the moonlit sand, “Sleep fans my brow: Sleep makes us all pashas; Or, if the wings are Death's, why Azraeel draws A childless father from an empty land.” “Nay,” saith a Voice. “the wind of Azraeel's wings A child's sweet breath hath stilled; so God decrees”:— A camel's bell comes tinkling on the breeze, Filling the Bedouin's brain with bubble of springs And scent of flowers and shadow of wavering trees Where, from a tent, a little maiden sings. JOHN THE PILGRIM THE MIRAGE (From “Carniola”) Beneath the sand-storm John the Pilgrim prays; But when he rises, lo! an Eden smiles, Green leafy slopes, meadows of chamomiles, Claspt in a silvery river's winding maze: “Water, water! Blessed be God!” he says, And totters gasping toward those happy isles. Then all is fled! Over the sandy piles The bald-eyed vultures come and stand at gaze. “God heard me not,” says he, “blessed be God!” And dies. But as he nears the pearly strand, Heav'n's outer coast where waiting angels stand, He looks below: “Farewell, thou hooded clod, Brown corpse the vultures tear on bloody sand: God heard my prayer for life—blessed be God!” COLUMBUS FOR THE FESTIVAL AT HUELVA A Castilla y a Leon Nuevo Mundo dió Colon. To Christ he cried to quell Death's deafening measure Sung by the storm to Death's own chartless sea; To Christ he cried for glimpse of grass or tree When, hovering o'er the calm, Death watched at leisure; And when he showed the men, now dazed with pleasure, Faith's new world glittering star-like on the lee, “I trust that by the help of Christ,” said he, “I presently shall light on golden treasure.” What treasure found he? Chains and pains and sorrow— Yea, all the wealth those noble seekers find Whose footfalls mark the music of mankind! 'Twas his to lend a life: 'twas Man's to borrow: 'Twas his to make, but not to share, the morrow Who in Love's memory lives this morn enshrined. BEATRICE FOR THE SIXTH CENTENARY OF BEATRICE'S DEATH, COMMEMORATED AT FLORENCE IN MAY, 1890 Thou, spreading through six hundred years an air Of memory fresh as Morning's altar-spice, Thou, Star of Dante—Star of Paradise, Hast made the star of womanhood more fair; For though thou art now his lofty guardian there, Victress o'er jealous Sin, who dared entice His feet from thee “ Purg.,” c. xxx. See also Guido Cavalcanti's sonnet to Dante Alighieri, rebuking his way of life after the death of Beatrice.—though now the high device Of wisdom lights the wreath around thine hair; Those eyes can dim the angels' eyes above Because they tell what flight was thine below: No eagle-flight past peaks of fire and snow, But through Life's leaves the flutter of a dove Whose beating wings soothed Dante's air with love— Struck music from the wind of Dante's woe. THE THREE FAUSTS INSCRIBED TO MISS ELEONORE D'ESTERRE KEELING I THE MUSIC OF HELL I had a dream of wizard harps of hell Beating through starry worlds a pulse of pain That held them shuddering in a fiery spell, Yea, spite of all their songs—a fell refrain Which, leaping from some red orchestral sun, Through constellations and through eyeless space Sought some pure core of bale, and finding one (An orb whose shadows flickering on her face Seemed tragic shadows from some comic mim Incarnate visions mouthing hopes and fears That Fate was playing to the Fiend of Time), Died in a laugh 'mid oceanic tears: “Berlioz,” I said, “thy strong hand makes me weep, That God did ever wake a world from sleep.” II THE MUSIC OF EARTH I had a dream of golden harps of earth: And when they shook the web of human life, The warp of sorrow and the weft of mirth, Divinely trembling in a blissful strife, Seemed answering in a dream that master-song Which built the world and lit the holy skies. Oh, then my listening soul waxed great and strong Till my flesh trembled at her high replies! But when the web seemed answering lower strings Which hymn the temple at the god's expense. And bid the soul fly low on fleshly wings To gather dews—rich honey-dews of sense, “Gounod,” I said, “I love that siren-breath, Though with it chimes the throbbing heart of Death.” III THE MUSIC OF HEAVEN I had a dream of azure harps of heaven Beating through starry worlds a pulse of joy, Quickening the light with Love's electric leaven, Quelling Death's hand, uplifted to destroy, Building the rainbow there with tears of man High over hell, bright over Night's abysses, The arc of sorrow in a smiling span Of tears of many a lover's dying kisses, And tears of many a Gretchen's towering sorrow, And many a soul fainting for dearth of kin, And many a soul that hath but night for morrow, And many a soul that hath no day but sin; “Schumann,” I said, “thine is a wondrous story Of tears so bright they dim the seraphs' glory.” TOAST TO OMAR KHAYYÀM AN EAST ANGLIAN ECHO-CHORUS INSCRIBED TO JAMES ROBERTS BROWN AND OLD OMARIAN FRIENDS IN MEMORY OF HAPPY DAYS BY OUSE AND CAM CHORUS. In this red wine, where Memory's eyes seem glowing, And days when wines were bright by Ouse and Cam, And Norfolk's foaming nectar glittered, showing What beard of gold John Barleycorn was growing, We drink to thee, right heir of Nature's knowing, Omar Khayyàm! I Star-gazer, who canst read, when Night is strowing Her scriptured orbs on Time's wide oriflamme, Nature's proud blazon: “Who shall bless or damn? Life, Death, and Doom are all of my bestowing!” Chorus: Omar Khayyàm! II Poet, whose stream of balm and music, flowing Through Persian gardens, widened till it swam— A fragrant tide no bank of Time shall dam— Through Suffolk meads, where gorse and may were blowing, Chorus: Omar Khayyàm! III Who blent thy song with sound of cattle lowing, And caw of rooks that perch on ewe and ram, And hymn of lark, and bleat of orphan lamb, And swish of scythe in Bredfield's dewy mowing? Chorus: Omar Khayyàm! IV 'Twas Fitz, “Old Fitz,” whose knowledge, farther going Than lore of Omar, “Wisdom's starry Cham,” Made richer still thine opulent epigram: Sowed seed from seed of thine immortal sowing. Chorus: Omar Khayyàm In this red wine, where Memory's eyes seem glowing, And days when wines were bright by Ouse and Cam, And Norfolk's foaming nectar glittered, showing What beard of gold John Barleycorn was growing, We drink to thee till, hark! the cock is crowing! Omar Khayyàm! PRAYER TO THE WINDS ON PLANTING AT THE HEAD OF FITZGERALD'S GRAVE TWO ROSE-TREES WHOSE ANCESTORS HAD SCATTERED THEIR PETALS OVER THE TOMB OF OMAR KHAYYÀM “My tomb shall be on a spot where the north-wind may strow roses upon it.” Omar Khayyàm to Kwájah Nizami. Hear us, ye winds! From where the north-wind strows Blossoms that crown “the King of Wisdom's” tomb, The trees here planted bring remembered bloom, Dreaming in seed of Love's ancestral rose, To meadows where a braver north-wind blows O'er greener grass, o'er hedge-rose, may, and broom, And all that make East England's field-perfume Dearer than any fragrance Persia knows. Hear us, ye winds, North, East, and West and South, This granite covers him whose golden mouth Made wiser ev'n the Word of Wisdom's King: Blow softly over Omar's Western herald Till roses rich of Omar's dust shall spring From richer dust of Suffolk's rare Fitzgerald. QUEEN KATHERINE ON SEEING MISS ELLEN TERRY AS KATHERINE IN “KING HENRY VIII.” Seeking a tongue for tongueless shadow-land, Has Katherine's soul come back with power to quell A sister-soul incarnate, and compel Its bodily voice to speak by Grief's command? Or is it Katherine's self returns to stand As erst she stood defying Wolsey's spell— Returns with those wild wrongs she fain would tell Which Memory bore to Eden's amaranth-strand? Or is it thou, dear friend—this Queen, whose face The salt of many tears hath scarred and stung?— Can it be thou, whose genius, ever young, Lighting the body with the spirit's grace, Is loved by England—loved by all the race Round all the world enlinked by Shakespeare's tongue! DICKENS RETURNS ON CHRISTMAS DAY A ragged girl in Drury Lane was heard to exclaim “Dickens dead? Then will Father Christmas die too?” —June 9, 1870. “Dickens is dead!” Beneath that grievous cry London seemed shivering in the summer heat; Strangers took up the tale like friends that meet: Dickens is dead! said they, and hurried by; Street children stopped their games—they knew not why, But some new night seemed darkening down the street. A girl in rags, staying her way-worn feet, Cried, “Dickens dead? Will Father Christmas die?” City he loved, take courage on thy way! He loves thee still, in all thy joys and fears. Though he whose smile made bright thine eyes of grey— Though he whose voice, uttering thy burthened years, Made laughters bubble through thy sea of tears— Is gone, Dickens returns on Christmas Day! THE CHRISTMAS TREE AT “THE PINES” Life still hath one romance that naught can bury— Not Time himself, who coffins Life's romances— For still will Christmas gild the year's mischances, If Childhood comes, as here, to make him merry— To kiss with lips more ruddy than the cherry— To smile with eyes outshining by their glances The Christmas tree—to dance with fairy dances And crown his hoary brow with leaf and berry. And as to us, dear friend, the carols sung Are fresh as ever. Bright is yonder bough Of mistletoe as that which shone and swung When you and I and Friendship made a vow That Childhood's Christmas still should seal each brow— Friendship's, and yours, and mine—and keep us young. PROPHETIC PICTURES AT VENICE (From “Carniola”) I THE WALTZ AT THE VENETIAN BALL Has she forgotten for such halls as these The domes the angels built in holy times, When wings were ours in childhood's flowery climes To dance with butterflies and golden bees?— Forgotten how the sunny-fingered breeze Shook out those English harebells' magic chimes On that child-wedding morn, 'neath English limes, 'Mid wild-flowers tall enough to kiss her knees? The love that childhood cradled—girlhood nursed— Has she forgotten it for this dull play, Where far-off pigmies seem to waltz and sway Like dancers in a telescope reversed? Or does not pallid Conscience come and say, “Who sells her glory of beauty stands accursed”? But was it this that bought her—this poor splendour That won her from her troth and wildflower wreath Who “cracked the foxglove bells” on Grayland Heath, Or played with playful winds that tried to bend her, Or, tripping through the deer-park, tall and slender, Answered the larks above, the crakes beneath, Or mocked, with glitter of laughing lips and teeth, When Love grew grave—to hide her soul's surrender? Her soul's surrender! Well—yon future spouse Paid nothing for the soul! He bought, as rake, “A woman's points”: bought, bought these lips that shake The heart with wonder when they seal their vows— These eyes where hues of sky and ocean take All shapes of love—these brows!—my darling's brows! The body knows me as I touch her waist— The fingers throbbing through the little glove— The fingers trembling at my arm above— The breast whose pearls are heaving interlaced: All know these arms of mine that once embraced. Though I could give no coronet but love— That gift which “only a child had dared approve”— The soul's sweet temple holds me uneffaced: The body feels me “crack” those foxglove bells In this soft hand to “make the elfin thunder”: In these pink ears I think the music swells To Fate's world-waltz that holds the stars asunder: But 'tis the soul has learnt what Mammon sells: As here we spin, what are its thoughts? I wonder. II THE TEMPTATION THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT AFTER THE WALTZ AT THE VENETIAN BALL When hope lies dead—ah, when 'tis death to live, And wrongs remembered make the heart still bleed, Better are Sleep's kind lies for Life's blind need Than truth, if lies a little peace can give. A little peace! 'tis thy prerogative, O Sleep! to lend it; thine to quell or feed This love that starves—this starving soul's long greed, And bid Regret, the queen of hell, forgive. Yon moon that mocks me thro' the uncurtained glass Recalls that other night, that other moon,— Two English lovers on a grey lagoon,— The voices from the lantern'd gondolas, The kiss, the breath, the flashing eyes, and, soon, The throbbing stillness: all the heaven that was. (The Lover lies watching the moonlight as it shines through the emblazoned glass of the bedroom windows, illuminating the walls and moving from picture to picture.) III PROPHETIC PICTURES ON THE WALLS. How ruby-red the light of morning falls On each emblazoned pane whose tints illume With prophecies the pictures round the room! The warriors, doges, nobles, cardinals, Battles, processions, floating festivals, Venetian girls, Venetian dames a-bloom With mid-life's chilly joys of gem and plume,— All leap to life upon the kindled walls. Each painted vision seems a living part Of Memory's pageant marshalled by my grief. It says, “The future garners no relief, No solace for that anguish at thy heart.” The light that falls thro' yonder amulet Makes every picture say, “Forget, forget.” IV PROPHECY OF THE FIRST PICTURE (The light falls through the windows on the picture of “The Dark Knight and the Ferryman.” The Lover reads aloud the descriptive verses on the frame.) The boatman sate with brawny arms embrowned, Steadying the wherry as it rocked afloat; The “Dark Knight” came, and on his shield and coat Symbols of doom and hell's devices frowned. He leapt aboard. “Wilt row to Devil's Ground For gold?” The man sate dumb with choking throat. “Who finds the devil in his ferry-boat Must row him,” said his soul, “across the sound.” “He who takes the devil in his boat must row across the sound.” —Old Proverb. To Devil's Ground he rowed, a sulphurous coast; “Alight,” said then the Knight, “'tis here we dwell.” “Nay, Dark Knight, nay, though here my boat hath crossed, I asked thee not aboard.” “Thou rowest well; Who ships the devil is not always lost, But lost is he who rows him home to Hell.” V PROPHECY OF THE SECOND PICTURE (The light falls through the windows on the picture of “The Damsel of the Plain.” The Lover reads aloud the descriptive verses on the frame.) Childe Rowland found a Damsel on the Plain, Her daffodil crown lit all her shining head; He kissed her mouth, and through the world they sped, The beauteous, smiling world, in sun and rain. But when long joys made love a golden chain, He slew her by the sea; then, as he fled, Voices of earth and air and ocean said, “The maid was Truth: God bids you meet again.” Between the devil and the Lord's deep sea He met a foe more soul-compelling still; A feathered snake the monster seemed to be, And wore a wreath o' the yellow daffodil. Then spake the devil: “Rowland, fly to me: When murdered Truth returns she comes to kill.” VI PROPHECY OF THE THIRD PICTURE (The light falls through the windows on the Rosicrucian panel-picture called “The Rosy Scar,” depicting Christian galley-slaves on board an Algerine galley watching, on Christmas-eve, for the promised appearance of Rosenkreutz as a “rosy-phantom.” The Lover reads aloud the descriptive verses on the frame.) “While Night's dark horses waited for the wind, He stood—he shone—where Sunset's fiery glaives Flickered behind the clouds; then, o'er the waves, He came to them, Faith's remnant sorrow-thinned. The Paynim sailors clustering, tawny-skinned, Cried, ‘Who is he that comes to Christian slaves? Nor water-sprite nor jinni of sunset caves, The rosy phantom stands nor winged nor finned.” All night he stood till shone the Christmas-star; Slowly the Rosy Cross, streak after streak, Flushed the grey sky—flushed sea and sail and spar, Flushed, blessing every slave's woe-wasted cheek. Then did great Rosenkreutz, the Dew-King, speak: “Sufferers, take heart, Christ lends the Rosy Scar.” NEW YEAR'S MORNING, 1867, AFTER THE LIBERATION OF VENICE (The Poet goes to the window of his bedroom and gazes down the Grand Canal, over which the morning is glowing.) “Man's knowledge, save before his fellow man, Is ignorance—his widest wisdom folly. In Nature's eyes still gazing, dazzled wholly By sights his own eyes make, how should he scan Pictures like those in Nature's iris-span? Hers show the cypress, his the melancholy, His shine with Christmas, hers with simple holly That knew no mirth till Yule-tide feasts began.” So Reason says; yet to my heart it seems That yonder sun, firing the mists of morn, Gilding each dome that scorned the Austrian's scorn, Painting the Grand Canal with rosy gleams, Looks conscious down on me and vanished dreams— But—Freedom's year o'er Venice smiles new-born! WHAT THE SILENT VOICES SAID A SONNET SEQUENCE I IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY “As the procession wound through the vast fane, bars and curiously formed flakes of golden light would, every now and then, break through the gloomy atmosphere and play along the tops of the arches and the roof.” “Love is the spirit's life and withers never: We twain shall meet again on some bright shore!” So spake my heart, but still within its core Whisper'd that foe who mocks the soul's endeavour: “The very greatness of the man shall sever Thy soul from such a soul so wing'd to soar: Love wins no starry strand that can restore To thee a soul whose pinions mount for ever.” Though well I knew the voice was coward Fear's, It marred the solemn music in mine ears, Till, sudden, through the vapour-curtain grey Veiling the roof, fluttered a flake of light: A golden hand it seemed: I saw it play Along the roof—along the “Lantern's” height. II THE GOLDEN HAND Was it a sign from those, forgot by Fame, Who built the minster—built by that same spell Which bids the honey-bee fit cell to cell— Who shaped in joy until dead stone became A thing of life—who worked with poet's aim When seized by song to make what shall compel The maker's own fierce heart to say “'Tis well”— Careless for other praise, for other blame? For I recalled how scarce three years before I followed Browning down the sacred floor, When minster-spirits seemed to haunt the fane:— Heroes of song and those whose blood was spilt For England and those nameless ones who built Our temple seemed to join the funeral train. III THE GOLDEN SCROLL “That beckoning hand,” I said, “mysterious, golden, Playing along the roof in bright unrest As if in welcome of this royal guest: Comes it from those who built these arches olden?” But as I spoke it changed: a scroll unfolden Shone with the master's words that oft had bless'd My heart in youth when, dark and sorely press'd, It yearned for light to strengthen and embolden. I read the words that helped me when a boy Roaming with book in hand the Ouse's side: I drew again, from founts that cannot cloy, Draughts of immortal song, till Faith defied Fear's hissing head, and poetry and joy And youth returned, and grief was quelled by pride. IV THE MINSTER SPIRITS “Behold, ye builders, demigods who made England's Walhalla, ye who haunt this pile Of living stone! behold us here defile Behind this pall, winding through light and shade Of arch and pillar, where such bones are laid As Time can only breed in one loved isle— 'Tis Tennyson we bring: he was erewhile Our king,” I said; “we loved him undismayed!” Sorrow had fled; for pride and joy of him Made Life seem Death—made Death seem Life's own life— And more and more the mighty fane grew rife With spirits mighty. Yet mine eyes grew dim For her who watch'd at Aldworth, that dear wife He loved so well, when rose her loving hymn. V THE SILENT VOICES Sweet was the sweet wife's music, and consoling: The past returned: I heard the master's talk, That many a time in many a happy walk I heard when through the whin of Aldworth strolling, Or on the cliffs of Wight with billows rolling Below the jaggy walls of gleaming chalk: Again I saw him stay his giant-stalk To watch the foamy-crested breakers shoaling. And when the music ceased and pictures fled I walked as in a dream around the grave, And looked adown and saw the flowers out-spread, And spirit-voices spake from aisle and nave:— “To follow him be true, be pure, be brave: Thou needest not his lyre,” the voices said. VI WHAT THE VOICES SAID “Beyond the sun, beyond the furthest star, Shines still the land which poets still may win Whose poems are their lives—whose souls within Hold naught in dread save Art's high conscience-bar— Who have for muse a maiden free from scar— Who know how beauty dies at touch of sin— Who love mankind, yet, having gods for kin, Breathe zephyrs, in the street, from climes afar. Heedless of phantom Fame—heedless of all Save pity and love to light the life of Man— True poets work, winning a sunnier span For Nature's martyr—Night's ancestral thrall: True poets work, yet listen for the call Bidding them join their country and their clan.” October 1892 COLERIDGE I see thee pine like her in golden story Who, in her prison, woke and saw, one day, The gates thrown open—saw the sunbeams play, With only a web 'tween her and summer's glory; Who, when that web—so frail, so transitory, It broke before her breath—had fallen away, Saw other webs and others rise for aye Which kept her prisoned till her hair was hoary. Those songs half-sung that yet were all divine— That woke Romance, the queen, to reign afresh— Had been but preludes from that lyre of thine, Could thy rare spirit's wings have pierced the mesh Spun by the wizard who compels the flesh But lets the poet see how heav'n can shine. CHRISTINA ROSSETTI THE TWO CHRISTMASTIDES I On Winter's woof, which scarcely seems of snow, But hangs translucent, like a virgin's veil, O'er headstone, monument, and guardian-rail, The New Year's sun shines golden—seems to throw Upon her coffin-flowers a greeting glow Prom lands she loved to think on—seems to trail Love's holy radiance from the very Grail O'er those white flowers before they sink below. Is that a spirit or bird whose sudden song From yonder sunlit tree beside the grave Recalls a robin's warble, sweet yet strong, Upon a lawn beloved of wind and wave— Recalls her “Christmas Robin,” ruddy, brave, Winning the crumbs she throws where blackbirds throng? II In Christmastide of heaven does she recall Those happy days with Gabriel by the sea, Who gathered round him those he loved, when she “Must coax the birds to join the festival,” And said, “The sea-sweet winds are musical With carols from the billows singing free Around the groynes, and every shrub and tree Seems conscious of the Channel's rise and fall”? The coffin lowers, and I can see her now— See the loved kindred standing by her side, As once I saw them 'neath our Christmas bough— And her, that dearer one, who sanctified With halo of mother's love our Christmas-tide— And Gabriel too—with peace upon his brow. TO A SLEEPER AT ROME For the unveiling by Edmund Gosse of the American memorial bust to the poet Keats in Hampstead Parish Church, July 16, 1894. Thy gardens, bright with limbs of gods at play— Those bowers whose flowers are fruits, Hesperian sweets That light with heaven the soul of him who eats, And lend his veins Olympian blood of day— Were only lent, and, since thou couldst not stay, Better to die than wake in sorrow, Keats, Where even the Siren's song no longer cheats— Where Love's long “Street of Tombs” still lengthens grey. Better to nestle there in arms of Flora, Ere Youth—the king of Earth and Beauty's heir— Drinking such breath in meadows of Aurora As bards of morning drank, Ægean air— Wake in old age's caverns of Ellora, Carven with visions dead and sights that were! IN A GRAVEYARD OLIVER MADOX BROWN November 12, 1874 Farewell to thee, and to our dreams farewell— Dreams of high deeds and golden days of thine, Where once again should Art's twin powers combine— The painter's wizard-wand, the poet's spell! Though Death strikes free, careless of Heaven and Hell— Careless of Man, of Love's most lovely shrine; Yet must Man speak—must ask of Heaven a sign That this wild world is God's, and all is well. Last night we mourned thee, cursing eyeless Death, Who, sparing sons of Baal and Ashtoreth, Must needs slay thee, with all the world to slay; But round this grave the winds of winter say: “On earth what hath the poet? An alien breath. Night holds the keys that ope the doors of Day.” TWO LETTERS TO A FRIEND Letter I. AFTER THE WEDDING Bright-browed as Summer's self, who claspt the land, With eyes like English skies, where seemed to play Deep azure dreams behind the tender grey, All light and love, she moved: I see her stand Beneath that tree; I see the happy band Of bridesmaids on the lawn where blossoms sway In light so rare, it seems as if the day Glowed conscious of the future's rosy strand. O Friend, if sun and wind and flowers and birds, In language deeper drawn than human words, From deeper founts than Time shall e'er destroy, All spoke to thee in Summer's rich caress, Even so my heart, though wordless too, could bless; It could but feel a joy to know thy joy. Letter II. AFTER DEATH'S MOCKERY When death from out the dark, by one blind blow, Strikes down Love's heart of hearts—severs a life— Cleaves it in twain as by a sudden knife, Leaving the dreadful Present, dumb with woe, Mocked by a Past, whose rainbow-skies aglow O'erarch Love's bowers, where all his flowers seem rife In bloom of one sweet loving girl and wife— Then Friendship's voice must whisper, whisper low. Though well I know 'tis thou who dost inherit Heroic blood and faith that lends the spirit Strength known to souls like thine, of noblest strain, Comfort I dare not proffer. What relief Shall Friendship proffer Love in such wild grief? I can but suffer pain to know thy pain: I can but suffer pain; and yet to me Returns that day whose light seemed heavenly light, Whose breath seemed incense rising to unite That lawn—where every flower and bird and bee Seemed loving her who shone beneath that tree— With lawns far off, whose flowers of higher delight, Beyond Death's icy peaks and fens of night, Bloomed 'neath a heaven her eyes, not ours, could see. Brother, did Nature mock us with that glory Which seemed to prophesy Love's rounded story? Or was it that sweet Summer's fond device To show thee who shall stand on Eden slopes, Where bloom the broken buds of earthly hopes— Stand waiting 'neath a tree of Paradise? ANCESTRAL MEMORY THE DEAF AND DUMB SON OF CRŒSUS He saw their spears who scaled the parapet, Then—pouring, glittering, with a torrent's force, Through battered gates—the spears! Without remorse He struck, he slew, round Crœsus sore beset. He heard not Slaughter's din, but felt her sweat And smelt her breath where many a bloody corse, Trampled by Persian camel, Lydian horse, Showed how at Sardis Fate and Crœsus met. But when he saw his father down at last— Down, waiting death at some fierce foeman's stroke— Louder the dumb boy shrieked than Winter's blast: “Man, kill not Crœsus!” 'Twas the Race that spoke: The blood of Lydian Kings within him woke Ancestral memory—woke the sceptred Past. APOLLO IN PARIS TO THE FRENCH ACADEMY ON THE ELECTION OF M. J. M. DE HÉRÉDIA I Spires, roofs, and towers gleam in the sunset's glow Till Paris burns like some old poet-town That draws Apollo's radiant presence down By music mounting from his sons below: Methinks he greets you, fearless men who know His sons and guard them, lest their sire's renown Be dimmed when bastard fingers clutch the crown Of him, our Lord of light and lyre and bow. As when he scared the hordes who sacked old Rome That day he soared above his temple-dome When gods were fleeing the voices of the Vandals, I see him now whose song keeps heaven immortal; I see him now: he shines above your portal, Phœbus from golden curls to golden sandals! II With limbs of light I see the song-god stand Flushing your roof! He knows your hands are strong Against his foes, the brazen-throated throng, Whose breath is blight to beauty in every land; “Foes of my foes,” saith he, “who dare withstand The great coarse voice that works my children wrong, Ye crown Hérédia with the crown of song Heedless of all save Art's divine command! He sings the past—the beauty that hath been: I love him, I—remembering those bright days Before the world grew grey of Vandal haze, When gods might mix with men of godlike mien And maids with lovesome eyes of mortal sheen, Sweet goddesses of earth with Woman's ways: III I love the song-born poet, for that he Loves only song—seeks for love's sake alone Shy Poesie, whose dearest bowers, unknown To feudaries of Fame, are known to me.” So saith the god, in tones which seem to be That music of the sunset richly blown When sinks the sun-god from his sinking throne Within the burnished bosom of the sea. He soars away, a star in rosy air; But see! the memory of his presence there Lives where he stood. Yea, though a god hath fled, Leaving a fading memory scarce beholden, A true god's very shadow glimmers golden With lovelier light than mortal brows can shed. ENVOY. The poet sings what Nature, dreaming, saith, But still his Bride is Art—that starry wife From shores where music of the gods is rife. She teaches him the strain that conquereth, Whether he touch the lyre, or breathe his breath Through flute of Phœbus or through Pan's wild fife— Whether of Man he sings or Nature's life, Or shining sward beyond the dykes of death. Yet, though he asks but this, the Bride's acclaim— Though not Fame's trumpet nor the wreath of Fame Can give the bridegroom joy whose Bride is Art— He grieves when bastard-brows are crowned with flowers, And Helicon grows noisier than a mart— Remembering Poesie within her bowers. AT THE THÉATRE FRANÇAIS ON THE REVIVAL, AFTER FIFTY YEARS, OF “LE ROI S'AMUSE” November 22, 1882 Poet of pity and scourge of sceptred crime— Titan of light, with scarce the gods for peers— What thoughts come to thee through the mist of years, There sitting calm, master of Fate and Time? Homage from every tongue, from every clime, In place of gibes, fills now thy satiate ears. Mine own heart swells, mine eyelids prick with tears In very pride of thee, old man sublime! And thou, the mother who bore him, beauteous France, Round whose fair limbs what web of sorrow is spun!— I see thee lift thy tear-stained countenance— Victress by many a victory he hath won; I hear thy voice o'er winds of Fate and Chance Say to the conquered world: “Behold my son!” TO MADAME CARNOT “When the President reached Dijon he had the happiness to find awaiting him on the railway platform his son, the lieutenant, and his daughter and son-in-law, with their little daughter, a sweet child of four. The grandfather took her into his carriage, and embraced her affectionately, and said how much more pleasant it would be to get out and stay at Dijon with her than to go on to Lyons. His eyes filled with tears as he gave her the parting kiss, and handed her to her father.” —Daily News, June 25, 1894. At Dijon gleamed on that bright countenance— Illumed by love of thee and love of those Who sprang from thee—tears born of coming woes. The sad prophetic Spirit of joyous France Wept too, methinks, to see her son advance To death; and when he kissed the child there rose That sight the Future's mirror sometimes shows, The mother-land in grip of Fate or Chance. “Daughter,” saith France to thee, “this day of sorrow Wins for his threatened land a sunnier morrow: His was the death could save me—not another: For me thy dear one robbed thee of his life— For me fought, bosom bare—yea, met the knife Hell whetted for the bosom of his Mother.” THE LAST WALK FROM BOAR'S HILL TO A. C. S. I One after one they go; and glade and heath, Where once we walked with them, and garden-bowers They made so dear, are haunted by the hours Once musical of those who sleep beneath; One after one does Sorrow's every wreath Bind closer you and me with funeral flowers, And Love and Memory from each loss of ours Forge conquering glaives to quell the conqueror Death. Since Love and Memory now refuse to yield The friend with whom we walk through mead and field To-day as on that day when last we parted, Can he be dead, indeed, whatever seem? Love shapes a presence out of Memory's dream, A living presence, Jowett golden-hearted. II Can he be dead? We walk through flowery ways From Boar's Hill down to Oxford, fain to know What nugget-gold, in drift of Time's long flow, The Bodleian mine hath stored from richer days; He, fresh as on that morn, with sparkling gaze, Hair bright as sunshine, white as moonlit snow, Still talks of Plato while the scene below Breaks gleaming through the veil of sunlit haze. Can he be dead? He shares our homeward walk, And by the river you arrest the talk To see the sun transfigure ere he sets The boatmen's children shining in the wherry And on the floating bridge the ply-rope wets, Making the clumsy craft an angel's ferry. III The river crossed, we walk 'neath glowing skies Through grass where cattle feed or stand and stare With burnished coats, glassing the coloured air— Fading as colour after colour dies: We pass the copse; we round the leafy rise— Start many a coney and partridge, hern and hare; We win the scholar's nest—his simple fare Made royal-rich by welcome in his eyes. Can he be dead? His heart was drawn to you. Ah! well that kindred heart within him knew The poet's heart of gold that gives the spell! Can he be dead? Your heart being drawn to him, How shall ev'n Death make that dear presence dim For you who loved him—us who loved him well? THE OCTOPUS OF THE GOLDEN ISLES “What! Will they even strike at me?” Round many an Isle of Song, in seas serene, With many a swimmer strove the poet-boy, Yet strove in love: their strength, I say, was joy To him, my friend—dear friend of godlike mien! But soon he felt beneath the billowy green A monster moving—moving to destroy: Limb after limb became the tortured toy Of coils that clung and lips that stung unseen. “And canst thou strike ev'n me?” the swimmer said, As rose above the waves the deadly eyes, Arms flecked with mouths that kissed in hellish wise, Quivering in hate around a hateful head.— I saw him fight old Envy's sorceries: I saw him sink: the man I loved is dead! LOVE HOLDS OF HEAVEN IN FEE AT A FUNERAL I These tears, as down the slope Death's pageant wends— These tears, whence come they—tears I cannot smother? Is it for thee they flow, my brother's brother? Is it for him they flow, or these dear friends? My thoughts are far away where water bends Around a grange—my thoughts are with that other Who held thee—yea, ere thou couldst babble “Mother,” Who holds thee still by strength that never ends. She holds thee—she who, like the mother-dove, Draws near her nestlings only to caress, Whose love for thee, for them, boundless, above All other wealth of Woman's tenderness, Is not their dower alone: its boon can bless All eyes which see that mother's eyes of love. II She holds thee still: Love holds of heaven in fee: Still lives that face where Nature seemed to write Life's twin-ancestral story in mingled light On lips whose smile was hers of love or glee, In eyes whose pictures from the blue-grey sea, Radiant of laughters, radiant in despite Of shadowy bars from lashes dark as night, Seemed like a sailor's memory haunting thee. She holds thee still; Death dares not dim that face Rich with the runes of each historic race, Where, like the message of an olden scroll Deep-glimmering in a priceless palimpsest, The language of the past seemed half-exprest Beneath the scriptures of a new-lit soul. THE WOOD-HAUNTER'S DREAM The wild things loved me, but a wood-sprite said: “Though meads are sweet when flowers at morn uncurl, And woods are sweet with nightingale and merle. Where are the dreams that flush'd thy childish bed? The Spirit of the Rainbow thou wouldst wed!” I rose, I found her—found a rain-drench'd girl Whose eyes of azure and limbs like roseate pearl Coloured the rain above her golden head. But when I stood by that sweet vision's side I saw no more the Rainbow's lovely stains; To her by whom the glowing heavens were dyed The sun showed naught but dripping woods and plains: “God gives the world the Rainbow, her the rains,” The wood-sprite laugh'd, “our seeker finds a bride.” MIDSHIPMAN LANYON “Midshipman Lanyon refused to leave the Admiral and perished.” —Times, June 30, 1893. Our tears are tears of pride who see thee stand, Watching the great bows dip, the stern uprear, Beside thy chief, whose hope was still to steer, Though Fate had said, “Ye shall not win the land!” What joy was thine to answer each command From him calamity had made more dear, Save that which bade thee part when Death drew near, Till Tryon sank with Lanyon at his hand! Death only and doom are sure: they come, they rend, But still the fight we make can crown us great: Life hath no joy like his who fights with Fate Shoulder to shoulder with a stricken friend: Proud are our tears for thee, most fortunate, Whose day, so brief, had such heroic end. A REMINISCENCE OF THE OPEN-AIR PLAYS Epilogue for the open-air performance of Banville's “Le Baiser,” in which Lady Archibald Campbell took the part of “Pierrot” and Miss Annie Schletter the part of the “Fairy.” —Coombe, August 9, 1889. TO PIERROT IN LOVE THE CLOWN WHOSE KISSES TURNED A CRONE TO A FAIRY-QUEEN What dost thou here, in Love's enchanted wood, Pierrot, who once wert safe as clown and thief— Held safe by love of fun and wine and food— From her who follows love of Woman, Grief— Her who, of old, stalked over Eden-grass Behind Love's baby-feet—whose shadow threw On every brook, as on a magic glass, Prophetic shapes of what should come to pass When tears got mixt with Paradisal dew? Kisses are loved but for the lips that kiss: Thine have restored a princess to her throne, Breaking the spell which barred from fairy bliss A fay and shrank her to a wrinkled crone; But, if thou dream'st that thou from Pantomime Shalt clasp an angel of the mystic moon— Clasp her on banks of Love's own rose and thyme, While woodland warblers ring the nuptial-chime— Bottom to thee were but a meek buffoon. When yonder fairy, long ago, was told The spell which caught her in malign eclipse, Turning her radiant body foul and old, Would yield to some knight-errant's virgin lips, And when, through many a weary day and night, She, wondering who the paladin would be Whose kiss should charm her from her grievous plight, Pictured a-many princely heroes bright, Dost thou suppose she ever pictured thee? 'Tis true the mischief of the foeman's charm Yielded to thee—to that first kiss of thine. We saw her tremble—lift a rose-wreath arm, Which late, all veined and shrivelled, made her pine; We saw her fingers rise and touch her cheek, As if the morning breeze across the wood, Which lately seemed to strike so chill and bleak Through all the wasted body, bent and weak, Were light and music now within her blood. 'Tis true thy kiss made all her form expand— Made all the skin grow smooth and pure as pearl, Till there she stood, tender, yet tall and grand, A queen of Faëry yet a lovesome girl, Within whose eyes—whose wide, new-litten eyes— New litten by thy kiss's re-creation— Expectant joy that yet was wild surprise Made all her flesh like light of summer skies When dawn lies dreaming of the morn's carnation. But when thou saw'st the breaking of the spell Within whose grip of might her soul had pined, Like some sweet butterfly that breaks the cell In which its purple pinions slept confined, And when thou heard'st the strains of elfin song Her sisters sang from rainbow cars above her— Didst thou suppose that she, though prisoned long, And freed at last by thee from all the wrong, Must for that kiss take Harlequin for lover? Hearken, sweet fool! Though Banville carried thee To lawns where love and song still share the sward Beyond the golden river few can see And fewer still, in these grey days, can ford; And though he bade the wings of Passion fan Thy face, till every line grows bright and human, Feathered thy spirit's wing for wider span, And fired thee with the fire that comes to man When first he plucks the rose of Nature, Woman; And though our actress gives thee that sweet gaze Where spirit and matter mingle in liquid blue— That face, where pity through the frolic plays— That form, whose lines of light Love's pencil drew— That voice, whose music seems a new caress Whenever passion makes a new transition From key to key of joy or quaint distress— That sigh, when, now, thy fairy's loveliness Leaves thee alone to mourn Love's vanished vision: Still art thou Pierrot—naught but Pierrot ever; For is not this the very word of Fate: “No mortal, clown or king, shall e'er dissever His present glory from his past estate”? Yet be thou wise and dry those foolish tears; The clown's first kiss was needed, not the clown, By her who, fired by hopes and chilled by fears, Sought but a kiss like thine for years on years: Be wise, I say, and wander back to town. LECONTE DE LISLE July 17, 1894 A REMINISCENCE OF THE JUBILEE REVIVAL OF “LE ROI S'AMUSE” November 22, 1882 Where'er thou art, canst thou forget that night When, after fifty years, the victory came, And Hugo—throned above all thrones of Fame— Watched his own mighty dream uncoil its might, And thou didst stand with shining locks of white And eyes that, answering our proud hearts' acclaim, Lost all their arrowy mockeries, and became Dim with the tears that made their lashes bright? Nirvana was thy quest! But love like thine For that great soul must bear thy kindled soul Where Love's high-chosen constellations shine Of stars unmingled with the “loveless Whole”: When love hath coloured life with hues divine, What poet seeks Nirvana's hueless goal? TO BRITAIN AND AMERICA ON THE DEATH OF JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL Ye twain who long forgot your brotherhood And those far fountains whence, through glorious years, Your fathers drew, for Freedom's pioneers, Your English speech, your dower of English blood— Ye ask to-day, in sorrow's holiest mood. When all save love seems film—ye ask in tears— “How shall we honour him whose name endears The footprints where belovèd Lowell stood?” Your hands he joined—those fratricidal hands, Once trembling, each, to seize a brother's throat: How shall ye honour him whose spirit stands Between you still?—Keep Love's bright sails afloat, For Lowell's sake, where once ye strove and smote On waves that must unite, not part, your strands. TO MRS. GARFIELD ON THE DEATH OF THE PRESIDENT Such strength as his, striving in such a strife, Will win at last: God gave thy dear one all: A seat above the conflict, power to call Peace like a Zephyr, when alarms were rife; Home music too, children and heroine wife, God gave: then gave Death's writing on the wall, And on the road the assassin: bade him fall, Death-stricken at the shining crest of Life. And yet our tears are sweet. God bade him taste All gifts of heav'n, like manna raining down— Clothed him with Good for Might, whose sweet renown Touched Ocean's lyre to music as it passed; Then crowned him thine indeed—giving at last Pain suffered well,—thy Garfield's deathless crown.</field>
