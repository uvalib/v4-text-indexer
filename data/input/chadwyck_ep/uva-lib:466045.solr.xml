      <field name="fulltext">BRACKENHAM CHURCH âThe clock's voice and the syllables of your dress Together stay my hand. Tune and silk Forbid a further flow of ink. The pen falls flat Upon a blotter; the verseman nods to Love. Dear, are you come for flowering Amid the books and papers in my room? Or do you wish to hear Your poem, written to a second shape? Or do you want no treasure else Than sitting on my rug to learn The whimsies breathed by wood and coal For light to publish, at its own expense? Do you know, I think the third must be your favourite want.â âYes; if you sit beside me in the dusk And marry me again.â âHow like you, Snowdrop! Wilt thou have This man to be thy wedded husband here, With coal and wood for witnesses, by song As homely as the verse of William Barnes?â âThou being thou, I will!â âLend me love's ring. I want to feel it press Along your finger on the way to home. One night last week I broke a thought in half To watch you rub a speck upon the gold While kitty's soothing, soothing, in your lapâ Four-footed sameness never quite the sameâ Recalled, in spite of fur, the evening of a dove. Ring, kitten, Snowdrop! William Barnes Had never bent to shape a theme so fair While warm with tenderness and country song At evenfall.â âOnly a Fairyman could wander thus Among the holiday parts of speech. Oak, Coal, and Dorset dialect, Collaborating, could not give so quickâ So brightâa run of melody, For all their dear companionship. Come close beside me on the rug and be Man, kitten, dove combined, With lots and lotsâand other lotsâof sweet. To-morrow at this hour, if reading flame, Let us consent to live as stirless as a bell Not ringing on a white campanula. Now's a too precious now.â âAgreed. Besides, I want to tell you what was found Midway between my first and second self While you were weeding flowers this afternoon.â âCome closerâcloser yet! I always shrink From second selves; and yours is dark, dark, dark.â âThe story is as quiet as a story told by moss.â âQuiet is a temple. Will the telling leave me glad?â âIt will. At four o'clock, Being out of tune with tyrant words, I dropped my pen, leaned back, and slept. When near a wood, I met a Dream Wearing the frock of lavender grey You wore in Kent the April afternoon That leaped to instant summer when you rose, Came with a smile, and wondered if I cared To see a flush of pansies all your own ... Our meeting well-nigh broke my trance With dreamlessness, so sharp the strain Of fronting eyes and lips that had the look Of sharing with your breast a hope Of finding in my heart a king. Were kisses trembling in the deep Of blueness almost grey? Love questioned. Love replied. Thenâtoo soon Having steadied to a calm, you pointed where A glittering loftier than the trees disclosed The spire of Brackenham Church.â âWhere was that church? Who spoke its name on being stopped by you?â âA lipless voice. Not even a child in search of flowers Wavered the air so sweet to Solitude; And yet I heard intensely well How you and I were come to Brackenham Church It slept along the looping of a stream Where meadowsweet was paler than its wont And loosestrife purple lessened, since the sun Of trance out-shone the sunning of our world. Forward we went As though a hidden thread Of heavenly weaving drew us to the porch. Next, while we wondered if the lock were fast, The oaken halves moved inward. Then was seen the aisle, The flock of pews, The Table of refreshment for the soul. Thither we went, hand keeping hand, Till we were come beneath a glory of glass Devoted to a Saint among the Twelve To whom their Lord, though shadowed then by death, Busily tendered equal bread and wine. How long we stood departed from our selves, I cannot answer. Was not the Ancient, Time, Fallen fast asleep, as long ago he slept For Israel serving God in Ajalon? Then suddenly we, the statues of the fane, Knelt as if two were one divinely told The nearness of a miracle yet toâ A Priest! A Priest!â The window was a life! That Spirit moved toward the purple cloth, As if remembering bread and wine, And prophecy from the lips he loved, Before, with not a rustle of robe, he turned Toward our shaken hearts and gleamed In front of us! Never shall I forget how close he read With eyes of Heaven the history of your face; Nor how he shot the arrow of his look To pierce my soul when yours had given to him Reply in tune with question. Had he found A fault in me too grave for Mercy's heart To speak forgiveness? So long endured his frozen search, I feared he could not bless me, for a harm In wait to shadow what he knew Was loveliness resident in your life; But, in a flash, the arrow lost Its bitter point. Turning from heart to heart, His eyes embraced us both, and shone content. Wordless, he took your tremulous hand in his And made it one with mine; Wordless, he melted gravity with a look The shadow of a smile; Wordless, his very presence was as though A counsel given in words. Thenâwe were left to pray. Who walked with Christ of old was gone Apart from us, without a sound or stir, Without a backward look, to watch in hope For souls in need of loneliness And confirmation. We, he knew, were his. By him to whom the clustering graves had vowed That churchâSaint John, the Dearly-Lovedâ Our lives, confronted, questioned, weighed, Had been accepted. Thus ran my dream. I kept it for an hour Of stillness spent with you in little light.â âI wish I knew a lovely way of thanks In lovely keeping with a tremulous hour Never to be forgotten. Sleep will come slow to-night; For, watchful of the window given by dream The presence and the absence of that Priest By whom our hands were joined, How should I feel mere body slip away From tumult? Wonder of wonders, this! Now tell what force, what colouring, what increase The poet in you added when he woke.â âI call Saint John to witness, of his truth, That I have spoken nothing else than trance Unaltered by a word of wakefulness.â âEven the beautiful can bring a wound. This startling, will it be one load the more To press a mind so lost in images, So split, So travel-stained? Forgive me if I seem to cloud Its vividness by telling of a breast That falters when you lose your country self Among immensities. Are you aware of this, That far too often in our bridal year, Lover of lipless voices, you have given No answer to my question? If you spoke, Replies were contradiction of the sense, Opposites hard for me to bear. You could not tell me, even for a kiss, The sudden wrong I did a week ago, When, since a third time you had failed To hear my voice, though but a yard Divided us, I coloured in despair. You cannot tell. Then listen. This was done: I struck a glass so roughly with my spoon That bowl and stem were shattered. No word! No quivering! Breath alone! Your soul and mine were strangers then. Blankness so withered me, Although I knew the riches of your love, That now, Orion being shadowed, I am forced To battle for my treasure, lest a mood Already at the danger-point become a worse Eclipsing of my household stars, So true, so native, so resolved. Forgive again! Because my hour had come To tell, to show, to plead, I dared for gain or loss. Remember this, If what you are must still be you, Love can but teach me how to double love.â âFragrance and Flower, how grieved I am! To think of it!â To think your voice became a shuffled sound Without significance, the tuning dead That should have sung me homeward from the mist! Even in childhood I was wont To lean my forehead on a windowpane, Weary of being held so far From lamb-like clouds without a friend To fold them when the blueness died to grey. At lastâso lateâI see, because of you, Why Mother often ran to turn me round And fill my ears with poems said To fetch me out of sky to her. Straining to breach the fortress held by Truth Is Martyrdom; no less; Each wrong direction but a setting-forth again. So loss begets a losing; So a zest of double fire Becomes the master's master, hounding him To leap, to snatch, to suffer empty hands.â âIs not the centre here? Are not the radiants more than we can count? Consider, Dearest, how a rose Resembles well the nebula's way Of bending petals from the heart Of generation. Be slow to hold a pansy's share Of mystery smaller than the grant Of mystery resident in a sun. Why barter Here and There, Since There and Here are samenesses? To drift from what, being Earth-in-Star, Has flowered so fair beyond expectancy Is leaving love to pine. If All is not beneath our roof, Then am I not the All I long to be, The All-in-All your fineness needs to have.â âEven the beautiful can bring a wound. I must remember. The windowpane my Mother lived to dread!â The ambush in the heavens that caught a wife Whose only zenith was her husband's roof!â The nebula causing in my dream (For this, I hold, can well explain That tensity of hushed regard) The Dearly-Loved to question if the souls In front of him were fortified Above defeat! For long, the child of Tenderness, you breathed As patient as a rosebud in the dark. If, since the habit in my blood is strong, You find me deaf and mute in seeming space, Run to my chair! Recover me from quest! Darken the Pleiades! certain of the end, Sure of my folding love! Home stars are best, And you, Forgiveness, have the central light.â âStand up, True Comforter! Though blinded utterly by tearsâ The happiest ever woman shedâ I see what lately was an hour Flash to a new-come star.â SPEAK! I could not bear a book of humdrum prose When this familiar miracle in green and white, Half-way across the honoured field, Was adding light to light. Foxglove with fingerstalls of velvety snow, I hurried to find you at a glamorous hour And whisper, âAre you bloom alone, Or girlhood fused with flower?â Listen! A wildered loveliness was turned To fountain; Daphne to laurel stem and spray. If almost caught in Thessaly, Tell how you swerved away! THE PROPOSAL Why warm this bud with loving looks Denied to me? Turn round and give The friend that cannot change to flower A moment sweet to live. Along the woodland's wearying length A dread was night, a hope was morn. Believe me, turning is the rose, Refusal is the thorn. No! Not an inch, nor two, nor half, But all; unless you darkly choose To squander on that bud the face My soul shall never lose! I had not dreamed a maid could whirl So stormily to dart the zest Of lightning's sudden self, and tear With joy her lover's breast. EXAMPLE Remember how a stream, If weak or strong, Lives lending in all weathers To fins and feathers His run of song. Thus let your care for me, As his for those, Live music by the sounding Of love abounding, And never close. INVOCATION Now eve is floating into night. Come, Fragrance! be yourself the light To make this shadowed study bright. Out of my roomâI know not when, Being held the like of nebulous men Who drift from voice and book and penâ Stole the young Sweetness loved by me As hedge and cloverfield agree In June to love the bridal bee. Rousing, I listened for the stir Of needles clicking over fur But half-alive with throbs of purr. Thereon I rose and called the name That took, when first the fancy came, Your breast with leaps, your throat with flame. Dull showed the velvet of your chair; Perished my hope to gather there With looks the blossoming of your hair. Dusk, weary at the windowsill, And fretted not to have her fill Of loveliness, is sighing still. Dead be the stay of clock and door! In bud from head to foot, restore The sweetness gone by bringing more! TOGETHER APART Here lies, beyond the tenderness of sleep On earth, a maid too rare to lie thus deep. Seven days ago she stood with me and read Some lines that Love had carved for beauty dead. Yet now a verse is waiting in my breast To grieve upon the cross above her rest. She left me broken, even as the sigh That, but for weakness, would have been Good-bye. Black Death is but a servant, who can care For dust alone. The Spirit takes the air. My heart believes that now in cloven space A soul looks fondly back to love my face. SOLILOQUY âWhen it was proved my Dear had turned to thief, As proved it was, or Pain had not gone fumingâ His unbelief the victim of beliefâ Adown love's path become a path of glooming, The common seemed as shabby as a cloud Bereft of vivid friendliness with thunder, And wearisome the little finch that vowed His broody girl the moorland's only wonder. By what keen faulting had my sweetheart slipped Thus soon from perfectness to imperfection, Denying heavenly fare so often lipped And stored in honey combs of recollection? Who yesterday clung close as ivy born For holding fast is now a tearing thorn.â THE MEETING My shadow met, one hour in dream, With Christ along the flinted road That led toward the settled weight Of Duty's load. The Saviour lifted up his hand To check me by a gentle touch, Asking a little in return For very much. The Christian service of a heart In tune with what He spoke of old While preaching Heaven upon the Mount In words of gold, This recompense alone He named Before He smiled and pointed straight Across the field that had for end The Vineyard gate. That revelation of the truth Upon a hillside long ago Was all the Saviour's flock of souls Could need to know. What other grief shall wound a world Of lives astray than shattering loss When madmen dare to lift the Purse Above the Cross? The hallowed words He spoke, to pour His fountain to the thirsty few That walked with Him, are bread and wine To-day anew. I serve, commanded by the dream, The warning hand, the gentle touch; Giving my little in return For very much. THOREAU In Walden, on a deathless page, he bendsâ Not caring how the woodland minutes passâ To weed his double crop of thought and food While making earth say beans instead of grass. Methinks a Spirit, beside the fallen hoe, Still questions, questions, all the long-loved scenes; Withdrawn so tensely that he cannot hear Time making earth say bricks instead of beans. TIME IN LOVE Clearly he wants her. Could he speak, How fast his words would run in claiming Her many joys! But Father Time Has not a single word for naming. Though sworn of old to wither life, He falters, falters, in the duty Of shaking petals from a flower Almost beyondâ Almost beyond the hope of Beauty. She is not young, except in heart, With two score years and five to carry, So Time's rebellious want is how To coax her loveliness to tarry. His touches on her forehead show But dimly, and all other lining Is tender in a way to seem As youth not goneâ As youth not gone, but youth refining. His labour is to keep the vow And yet to welcome Beauty pressing The hurt that pierced him when she drove His mood from withering to caressing. Those deep-set lakes of blue, those lips, That throat a little browned by heaven, Shall suffer changes trebly slow, And Time's deceitâ And Time's deceit shall be forgiven. KEEPING FAITH Good morrow, tousled Ragwort! come again With gold to flaunt among the harebells showing, For all the fisticuffs of thunder-rain, How slender lives are helped to bear with blowing. Your wealth the poverty of commonlands, You put my heart in double debt by spending (As benefactors rich with open hands) The gold was granted for a flower's defending. When first your kinsmen nodded from the grass Their rumpled heads to me in autumn glory I vowed that never nodless would I pass Their civil breed. This, Ragwort, is my story. Time's a poor scholar, but he knows at least How seldom man says grace before a feast. MOMENTS Millions there are to whom great cities call With luring voices: Theatre, Concert Hall, Museum, Abbey, Mart. In many a street Shuffle and grind and tap symphonic feet Of unremitting strangers, who repose, Or seem to, in such blunderment as throws My heart to panic, beaten from the rose And other wildings dear to men that roam Where Stillness has, and needs, a country home, Not greatly caring if the cuckoo sends Loud love too often to his female friends; But tides of tumult, were they now to leap In swirls across the meadows where I keep My hand in Solitude's, to fondle it Till lofty lamps of silver-gold are lit In eastward spaces, would, as though a death About to fall upon and strangle breath, Turn me from tame to wild ere swamping joys With all those rough Niagaras of noise. Blest are the heathland musers! for to these Uproar's no dainty, silence no disease. In chance-come shreds of workless time, Morning a bell, and evenfall a chime, Fast ran the fairy minutes when I found Stars in a thistled heaven of common ground; Aconites eager for the splitting fold Of green well wrapped about the baby gold Designed by Wisdom for the firstbornâSpringâ To watch a month ere yet the blackbirds sing; Beetles so packed with hardihood, so squat, So David-like in going forth to trounce Goliath Log with half of half an ounce, Masters and servants of their creeping lot; Countryfolk pansies, taught how best to wear June velvet with enough of seemly care To make a flight of honey women think Its newborn gloss the fairest of the fair; Waters not running only through a vale For minnow, marigold, and nightingale, But also through the offices where men's Queer farming tills a paper soil with pens, Holiday tune of rivulets the sound To help December's wheel go creaking round; And then, still lingering for the scythe to cut, As brown as sun can burn a hazelnut, What men and plough and horse have sown, And Clod, the ever-willing labourer, grown; Ragworts, plebeian, if you will, but yet Tough English peasants of the bygone cast, Nodding their welcomes, be it fine or wet, And, in the autumn, making money fast; Fungus that flutters timid life with redâ The Cardinal's colourâangry on his head, And stirs a poet, fretful at the sight, To sit him down upon a stump and write A lyric for his children to repeat While clustered on the hearthrug at his feet. Warm in the arms of Memory, when Rest, Not wearied, makes the third of us in bed, How soothingly I breathe the breath of flowers While listening to a rivulet in my head! FULL CIRCLE Child East came, laughed, and fled; Lad South came, glowed, and sped. Limp West, who's feebly kind, Potters about a bed, Pulls up and down the blind And shakes his rheumy head. Yet how the Child and Lad, Two runaways from rest, Can leap from warmth they had In Memory's breast! The Child shall tread a spade In sand that shone of old; The Lad shall pluck a maid Her brookside marigold, Present be past,âa glade, A wound, a passion told! West, shall we run to East Behind returning South To share a nursery feast, With sugar in the mouth; Twirl yet once more a top, Sow darling names in cress, See Mothers never stop From loving loveliness; Race back with Lad to mount The horse of life, and keep Big courage for the count Of what's ahead to leap; Fall, rise, endure, renew, Examine, learn, attain, Then tuck the fair review In Memory's bed again? Joy, at the birth of breath, With miracles begun, As though to sweeten death, Gave man two lives in one. For me, I shall not fear The pang of setting forth From recollection here To Love behind the North. COMPLETION The girl, aware of only thought, Woke him from musing in the wood Of Consolation. Coming close, She did not see him where he stood To learn the maid he long had sought. A glitter, and his life came whole! The glitter swept him, and was gone, To stay his central spark of time. Leaving him other than alone, She passed his body, not his soul. LOVE'S RETURN I heard my silver clock say âTen.â After three hours of fountain-pen With no release, I shared again the tonic moor That rolled in heather to my door A tide of peace. Methought a footfall not my own Spoke on the path and edged a stone To touch my shoe. How sweet of Fancy, by a flint Upon the moorland, thus to hint The old was new! GOLDEN WEDDING âThough radiance now is driven to leave behind Beautiful ashes only, these are still A pulse of guardian heat to warm the mind That cannot fade from you, nor ever will, By force of years in bloom with holiday Beyond life's wearing practice to remove; For all you pledged in front of God must stay The lamp I took with towering pride from Love To watch so piercingly that none but Death Should blow it into darkness. Even he Might stoop in doubt, before his gathered breath Drove life from flameâand homely heaven from me. What is a fruit? The old age of a flower. And what the windfall at my feet? This hour.â MY GRATITUDE Sweet-William, harvest is not come, Nor can be, till along my lawn You make of time no time but dawn. A friendâso Musing loves to thinkâ Fonder than poppies fallen away As though disliking holiday, You call me from a studious count Of nebulas, from foreign words, No less commandingly than birds; And even when that milky band Of stars related to your bloom Is glitter, glitter, in my room You tell my heart to go to bed Assured of loveliness when sight Comes home to live again with light. Not yours to wake the look I give When oriental poppies start With seeming coldness to depart, As though my presence were a blight To shrivel colour. You disdain The visit shortened to a pain. Sweet-William, harvest is not here, Nor can be, till you come and spend Your savings to enrich a friend. DISTRAUGHT In all his briefer travelling on the road Styled Broad than on the flinted road men name The Narrow, has he fared without a load To burn his shoulder, as a leap of flame Would brand him were he caught by common fire? Yes. But hurried along his separate trackâ The thirdâso flowered to sting him with desire, So fruited that his life is on the rack, He blunders from the cross his worth should bear In radiant honour of the martyred Lord; Now pulls it close; now drops it in despair, Alive and dead between the Strait and Broad. Friend, stoop to conquer! Now! With all your might! For lifting, lifting, lifting makes the cross seem light. THE END Go you where you will at last, Since nothing I can do Shall ever bring to me afresh The sweet that once was you. Searching with fairness in my soul, No shadows can I find Sombre enough in me to dull The colouring of your mind. Go you where you will, Caprice, Beyond the home and life Perceived as glittering when the maid In you had flowered to wife. Honour is flushing, Love is wroth, To have you fling away, With less redemption than a sigh, From married yesterday. AMEN Light come, light go. Methinks the end, If this be so, Will prove a friend. What shall I leave? My worst, my best. And what receive For certain? Rest.</field>
