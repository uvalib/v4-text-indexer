      <field name="fulltext">The Lay Folks Catechism. The English of Archbishop Thoresby's Instruction or Catechism for the People, from the authentic copy in his register at york. Is that a gret clerk shewes in his bokes, [A] Et est secundo sentenciarum distinctione prima, Of all the creatures that god made in heuen, And in erthe, in water, or in ayre, or in ought elles, The soueraigne cause and the skill whi that he made thaime, Was his owen gode will and his godenesse. Thurgh whilk godenesse, als he is all gode, He wold that som creatures of thas that he made Were communers of that blisse that euermor lastes. And for no creature might come to that ilk blisse Withouten knawing of god, als that clerk techis, —ubi supra— He made skillwise creatures, angel and man, Of witt and of wisdome to knaw god al-myghten, And, thurg thair knawing, loue him and serue him; And so come to that bliss that thai were made to. This maner of knawying had oure forme-fadyr In the state of innocency that thai were made in, And so shuld we have had, if thai had not synned, Noght so mikell als hali saules has now in heven, Bot mikel mare than man has now in erthe: For our forme-fadirs synned, sais the prophet, And we bere the wickednesse of thaire misdede. —Trenorum ultimo— For the knawing that thai had of god almighten, Thai had it of goddes giftt at thaire begynnyng With-outen travaile or trey or passyng of tyme; And all the knawyng þat we have in þis world of him, Is of heryng, and leryng and techyng of othir, Of the lawe and þe lare þat langes till halikirke, The whilke al creatures that loues god almighten Awe to knawe and to kun, and lede þaire lyue aftir; And so com to that blisse that never more blynnes. And forthi that mikill folke now in this world Ne is noght wele ynogh lered to knawe god almighten, Ne loue him, ne serue him als thai suld do, Als thaire dedis ofte sithe openly shewes, In grete peril of thaime to lyue and to sawle, And perauenture the defaitor in thaime, That has thaire saules to kepe, and suld teche thame, Als prelates, parsons, vikers, and prestes That er halden be dette for to lere thame— Oure fadir the Ercebishop, that god almighten saue, That als saint Paule sais of Iesu crist, —Paulus ad Thimotheum secundo ca?.—Will that al men be saufe and knawe god almighten, And namely thas underloutes that to him langes, Has treted and ordayned for commune profet, Thurgh the consaile of his clergie, That ilkane that vndir him has kepynge of saules, Openly on Inglis opon sononndaies Teche and preche thaim, that thai haue cure of, The lawe and the lore to knawe god all-mighten, That principali mai be shewed in this sex thinges: In þe fourtene poyntes that falles to the trouthe; The lawe and the lore to knawe god all-mighten, That principali may be shewed in this sex thinges: In the fourtene poyntes that falles to the trouthe, In the ten comandemente? that god has gyven us, In the seuen Sacrement? that er in hali kirke, In seuen dedis of merci until oure euen-cristen; In the seuen vertues that ilk man sal use, And in the seuen dedely sinnes that man sal refuse. And he comandes and biddes in al that he may, That all that haues kepyng or cure undir him Enioygne thair parochiens and thaire sugettes, That thai here and lere this ilk sex thinges, And oft sithes reherce tham til that thai kun thaime, And sithen teche tham thair childir, if thai any haue, What tyme so thai er of eld to lere tham. And that parsons and vikers and al paroche prestes Enquere diligently of thair sugettes, in the lentyn tyme, When thai come to shrift, whethir thai kun this sex thinges, And if it be funden that thai kun thaim noght, That thai en?oygne tham opon his behalue, And of payne of penaunce for to kun tham. And forthi that nane sal excuse tham Thurgh unknalechyng for to kun tham, Our fadir the Ercebisshop of his godenesse has ordayned and bidden that thai be shewed Openly on inglis o-monges the folk. Wharefore onentes the first of this sex thinges, That is, to knaw the articles that falles to the trouth, Als gret clerkes techis and shewes in thair bokes, Thare falles un-to the faithe fourtene poyntes Of whilk seuen falles to goddes godhede, and othir seuen falles to christes manhede. The first poynt that we sal trowe of the godhede Is to trowe stedefastly in a trew god, And that nane othir is for to trowe in. The tothir is, that the hegh fadir of heuen Is stedefast and sothefast god almighty. The third is, that Iesu crist goddes son of heuen Is sothefastly god euen til his fadir. The ferthe poynt is, that the hali gast, That samenly comes of bothe the fadir and the son, Is sothefastly god, and euen til tham bothe. And though-whethir noght twa goddes the fadir and the son, Ne thre goddes the fadir, and the son, and the haligast, Bot thre se[r]e persons and noght bot a god. The fift point is, that the trinite Fadir and sone and haligast, thre persons and a god, Is maker of heuen and of erthe and of all thinges. The sext poynt is, that halikirk our modir Is hali and allane thurgh-out the world, That is communyng and felawred of al cristen folk, That communes to-gedir in the sacrement? And in othir hali thinges that falles til halikirk, In forgyfnes of synnes, and hele of thair saules, For withouten halikirke nis na saule hele. The seuent article that us awe to trow Is uprisyng of flesh, and lyfe withouten end, For when that dede has sondred our bodies and oure saules For a certeyne tyme, als our kynde askes, Unto when that god sal deme the quick and the dede Than our saules sal turne ogayn til our bodies, And we, thas ilke, and naneothir than we er now, Sothefastly sal rise up in bodi and in saule That neuermare sal sondir fra that tyme forthe, Bot samen, if we wele do whiles we er here, Wend with god to that blis that euermare lastes, And als if we ivel do, til endeles payne. Thare er othir seuen poyntes of cristes manhede That er nedefull to trowe til al that er cristen. The first is, that Iesu crist, goddes sone of heuen, Was sothefastely consayued of the maiden mari, And toke flesh and blode, and bicome man Thurgh might and strenth of the haligast Withouten ony merryng of hir modirhede, Withouten ony mynnyng of hir maidenhede. That othir poynt, that we sal trow That he, god and man bathe in a person, Was sothefastly born of that blissed maiden, Godde, geten of his fadir before ony tyme, And man borne of his modir and brought forthe in tyme. The third poynt that we sal trowe is cristes passion, That he tholed bodily for synfulman kynd, Howe he was traised with his disciple, and taken with Iues, Beten with skourges that no skyn held, Nailed and (on) the rode, and corouned with thornes, And many othir hard paynes, and died atte last. The ferthe article is, that when he was dede, And his bodi tane doune, and wonden, and doluen Yit, to whiles that his bodi lai in the graue, The saule with the godhede went untill hell, And heried it, and toke oute thas that wer his, Als Adam and Eue, and othir forme-fadirs Whilke he in his forloke wold that wer saued. The fift poynt is, that on the third day Aftir that he died, he ras fra dede un-to lyue, Sothefast god, and man in bodi and in saule, For als he died in sekenesse of our manhede, Als he ras thurgh strenthe of his godhede, And so destrueyd our dede thurgh his dieyng, And whikend us un-to lyf thurgh his risyng. The sext poynt is, that we sal trowe, That the fourtied day aftir that he ras Thurgh strenth of him-self he stegh in-till heuen, Where our kynd is now in his blissed person, Noght anely euen no mete to his angels, Bot hegher crouned kyng aboue all angels, That before-tyme was lesse than kynd of angels. The seuend poynt is, that right als he died, And aftirward ras and stegh in-till heuen, Right swa sal he cum opon the last day. Bathe forto deme the quick and the dede; Whare all the folk that euer was, or is, or sall be, Sal sothefastly be shewed and sene befor him, And ilkman answer of his owen dedis And be dampned or saued whethir-sum he deserves, For als his rightwisenesse is now menged with mercy, So sal it than be withouten merci. The secund thyng of the sex to knawe god almighten Is the ten comandement?, that he has gyuen us, Of the whilk ten, the thre that er first Augh us haly to hald onentes our god, and the seuen that er aftir, onentes our euen cristen. The first commandement charges us and techis That we leue ne loute nane fals goddes, And in this commandement is forboden us Alkyns mysbileues, and al mawmetries, Al fals enchaunmentez, and al sorceries, All fals charmes, and all witchecraftes; All fals coniurisons, and al wicked craftes, That men of mysbyleue traistes opon, Or hopes ony help in, withouten god almighten. The secund commandement biddes us noght take In ydelship, ne in vayne the name of our god, So that we trow noght in his name, bot that is stedefast; That we swere noght be his name but behouely; And that we neuen noght his name but worshipfully. The third is, that we sal hald and halowe our haliday, The Sononday, and all othir that falles to the yhere, That er ordayned to halowe thurgh halikirk, In whilk daies all folk lered and lawed Awe to gyf tham godely to goddes seruice To here it and say it aftir thair state is In worship of god almighten and of his gode halowes, Noght than for to tent to tary with the world, Ne lyue in lykyng ne lust that the flesh yernes, Bot gladly to serue god in clennesse of life. The ferthe biddes us to do worship to fadir and to modir, Noght only to fleshli fadir and modir That getes and fosters us forthe in this world, Bot til our gastly fadirs that has hede of us, And techis us how to lif til hele of our saules. And til our gastly modir, that is halikirke To be buxom thar-to and saue the right of it, For it is modir til all that cristenly lyfes, And alswa til ilk man that worshipfull is, for to do worship aftir that it is. The fifth biddes us that we sla naman, That is at say, bodili ne gastly nouthir, For als mony we sla, in that at we mai, Als we sklaundir or bacbite or falsly defames, Or fandes for to confound tham that noght serues, Or withdrawes lyuelade fra tham that nede haues, If we be of haueing for to help tham. The sext commandement forbedes us to syn Or forto foly fleshli with any woman Outhir sib or fremned, wedded, or unwedded, Or any fleshly knawyng or deid haf with any, othir than the sacrement of matermoyne escuse, And the lawe and the lare of halikirke teches. The seuent comandement biddes us noght stele; In whilk is forboden robbyng and reuyng, All wrangwise takyng or withhaldyng, Or hiding or helyng of othir men godes Ogayne thaire wit, and thaire will that has right to tham. The aughtand biddes us we sall bere No fals wittenes ogayne our euen-cristen; In whilk is forboden al maner of lesyng, Fals conspiracie, and forsweryng. Whare-thurgh our euen-cristen mai lese thair catell, Faith, favour, or fame, or any thing elles, Whethir it be in gasteli or bodili godes. The neynd is, that we noght yerne our neghtebur house; In whilk is forboden all urangwise couatise Of land, or of lithe, or of ought elles, That mai noght be lifted ne raised fro the ground, Als thing that is stedefast, and mai not be stirred. The tend and the last is, that we yerne noght The wife of our neghtebur, ne of our euen-cristen, Ne his maiden, ne his knaue, his ox nor his asse: In whilk is forboden us to yerne or to take Ony thing that may be stirred of othir men godes, As robes or richesse, or othir catell That we have no gode title, ne no right to. For what thing so we gete, or tas on othir wise, We mai noght be assoiled of the trespas, Bot if we make assethe in that at we may To tham that we harmed, withaldand thair godes. And in cas that we have thurgh fals athes, Als in assizes or othir enquestes Wittandly and willfalli gere our euen cristen Lese thaire patrimoyne, or thair heritage, Or falsly be desesed of land or of lithe, Or fals diuorce be made, or any man dampned, Of all we do, that we may, unto the party, Yit may we noght be assoiled of our false athe, Bot of our bisshop or him that has his power, For swilk cas is riuely reserved til him seluen. This ten Comandement? that I haue nowe rekend Er umbilouked in twa of the godspell, Luce x?. cap?.The tane is we love god ouer al thinges, The tothir that we love our euen-cristen als we do oure selven. For god augh us to love halye with hert, With al our might, with al our thought, with word and with deid: Our euen-cristen alswa augh us to loue Un-to that ilk gode that we loue us selven, That is, that thai welefare in bodi and in saule, And cum to that ilk blisse that we think to. Who-so dos this twa fulfilles the othir. The third thing of the sex that I first touched Is the seuen sacrementz that halikirk gifes Thurgh prelates and othir prests that has the power. Of whilk seuen, the first fyve ilk a cristen man Augh lawfully to take aftir his eld is; And twa lies in thair wille that ressayves tham, The first sacrement of seuen is our baptisme, That we take the first tyme that we becum cristen, In whilk bathe the first syn that we er born with, And alkyn othir syn, is wasshen oway, that we er filed with ar we take it; And the trouthe of halikirk is taken thare-in Withouten whilk na synfulman saule may be saued. And to this sacrement falles foure thinges, If it sal rightly be taken als halikirk techis: Ane is right saying and shap of the wordes That him augh for to sai, that gyffes this sacrement That er thise: I baptize the in the name Of the fadir &amp; the son, &amp; the hali gast. Another is, that it be done anely in water, For nanothir licour is leuefull tharfore. The third is, that he that gyffes this sacrement Be in wit and in will for to gyff it. And the ferthe is, that he that takes it Be nouthir of lered, ne of lawed, baptized before; For if the prest be in were of him that sal take it, Whethir he be baptized or he be noght, Than sall he sai the wordes opon this wise— If thou be noght baptized, I baptize the In the name of the fadir and the son and the haligast. The secund sacrement is confermyng That the bisshop gives to tham that er baptized, That giffes thurgh his power to tham that tas it The grace and the giftes of the haligast To make tham mare stalworth than thai ware before To stand ogaynes the fend, and dedely syn, That nane has power to do bot bisshop allane That has the state and the stede of cristes apostels. The third sacrement is cald penaunce, That is sothefast forthinking we have of our syn Withouten will or thoght to turne ogayne to it. And this behoues haue thre thinges if it be stedefast: Ane is sorow of our hert that we have synned; Anothir is open shrift of our mouth how we haf synned, And the third is rightwise amendes makyng for that we haf synned. This thre, with gode will to forsake our syn, Clenses us and wasshes us of alkyn synnes. The ferthe is the sacrement of the auter, Cristes owen bodi in likeness of brede, Als hale as he toke it of that blessed maiden; Whilk ilk man and woman, that of eld is, Aught forto resceyve anes in the yhere, That is at sai, at paskes, als hali kirke uses, When thai er clensed of syn thurgh penaunce, Of payne of doyng out of hali kirke. Bot if thai forbere it be skilwise cause, That aught to be knawen to thaim that sal gif it, For he that takes it worthili, takes his salvation, And who-so unworthili, takes his dampnation. The fift sacrement is the last enoynting With oyle that is halowed and handeled of prest To tham that he wate er of skillwise elde, And that he seis sikerly in peril of dede, In lightenes and alegeaunce of their sekenesse, If god wil that thai turne ogayne until hele, And als in forgyuenesse of venyale synnes, And in lessyne of payne, if thai passe hethen. The sext sacrement of halikirke is Ordir, That giffes power to tham that rightwisely tas it For to serve in halikirk aftir thair state is, And to tham that takes the ordir of prest For to serue and for to minister sacrement? of halikyrk, that to tham falles Aftir the state that thai haue, and thair degree askes. The sevent sacrement is Matirmonye, That is, a lawefull festenyng betwix man and woman, At thair bother assent for to lyve samen Withouten ony lousyng to thair life lastes, In remedi of syn, and getyng of grace, If it be taken in gode attent and clennesse of lif. The ferthe thing of the sex to knaw god almighten, That us behoues fulfill in al that we mai, Is the seuen dedis of merci until our euen-cristen That god sal reherce us opon the dai of dome, and wit how we haf done tham here in this lyfe, Als saint matheu mas mynde in his godspell. —xxv?. capitulo.— Of whilk the first is to fede tham that er hungry. That othir, for to gif tham drynk that er thirsty. The third, for to clethe tham that er clatheless. The ferthe is to herber tham that er houselesse. The fifte, for visite tham that ligges in sekenesse. The sext, is to help tham that in prison er. The sevent, to bery dede men that has mister. Thise er the seuen bodily dedis of merci That ilk man augh to do that is mighty. Unde versus, vestio, poto, cibo, redimo, tego, colligo, condo. Thare er of merci allso seuen gasteli dedis That us augh to do to tham that has nede til us: Ane is to consaile and wisse tham that er will. A nothir is to withdrawe tham that will wirk ill. The third is to solace tham that er sorowfull. The ferthe is to pray for tham that er sinful. The fifte is to be tholemode when men misdos us. The sext gladly to forgyf when men has greued us. The seuent, when men askes us for to her tham, if we can mare than thai for to lere tham. Unde versus, Consule, castiga, solare, remitte, fer, ora, Instrue si poteris: sic cristo carus haberis. Thise til our neghtebors er ful nedefull, And to tham that dos tham wondir medefull, For he sal find merci that mercifull is, And man withouten merci of merci sal misse. The fifte thing of the sex to knaw god Almighten Is the seuen vertues that haliwrit techis, Of whilk seuen the thre first, that er heued thewes, Teches us how to haue us unto god almighten, And the four techis us swa for to lyf Bathe onentes our self and our euen-cristen That it be bathe likand to god and to man. The firste vertue is trouthe, whar thurgh we trow Anely in a God, that made al thinges, With al the othir articles I touched before; And this is nedefull til all that cristen lifes, For trouthe is beginyng of al gode werkes: For nouthir is trouth worth withouten gode werkes, Ne ne werk withouten trouth mai pai god almighten. The tothir gode thewe and vertue is hope, That is a siker abyding of gastely gode Thurgh goddes godeness, and our godedis, For to come to that blisse that never mare blinnes Not anely in traiste of goddes godeness Ne alanely in traist of our godededis, Bot in traist of tham when thai er bathe samen. For nouthir sal we fall so ferr in al wanhope That we ne sall traist to have blisse if we wele do, Ne we ne sal noght come so ferre in-til our hope That we sal traist so mikel of goddes godeness, That we sal hope to have blisse withouten gode dedis. The third vertu or thew is charite, The whilk is a dere loue that us augh to haue Unto god almighten and all our euen-cristen Unto god almighten al for him-selven, And al our euen-cristen for god almighten For the tane may nought be loued withouten the tothir, For als that saint Iohan sais in his epistell —ca?. iiij??.—That comandement, he sais, we have of god almighten, That wha-soeuer loues god, loues his euen cristen; For he that loues noght his brothir, wham he mai se, how suld he loue god almighten that he seis noght. The ferthe vertu or thewe is rightwisenesse, That is to yheld to al men that we augh tham, For to do til ilk man that us augh to do, For to worship tham that er worthi, For to helpe the pouer that er nedy, For to do gile ne wrang unto naman, bot for to do that skill is unto ilkman. The fift vertu or thew sleghe or sleghness —prudencia—That wisses us to be war with wathes of the world, for it kennes us to knaw the gode fra the yvel, And als-so to sundir the tane fra the tothir, and for to leue that is yvel, and take to the gode; and of twa gode thinges to chese the better. The sext vertu is strength or stalworthnesse, Noght anely of bodi, but of hert and of will, Euenly to sofir the wele and the wa, Welthe or wandreth, whethir so betides, And that our hert be noght to hegh for no welefare, Ne ouer mikel undir for nane yvel fare, But saffely for to stand ogaynes our faes, Whethir thai be bodili or thai be gastely, So that na foule fandyng make us to fall, Or be fals in our faithe ogayne god almighten. The seuent vertu and the laste is methe or methefulnsse,—temperancia— That hedis us fra outrage, and haldes us in euen Lettes fole lykynges and lustes of the flesch, And yhemes us fro yernynges of worldely godes, And kepes us in clennesse of bodi and of saule: For methe is mesur and met of al that we do, If we lyff skillwisely als the lawe techis. The sext thing and the last of thas I first touchid Is the seuen heued synnes or dedely synnes, That ilkman augh for to knawe to fle and forhoue, For man mai noght fle tham bot he knawe tham, Pride, enuy, wrath, and glotony, covatis and slauth, and licheri. And forthi er thai cald seuen heued synnes, For that al othir comes of tham, And forthi er thai cald dedli synnes, For thai gastely sla ilk mannes saule, That er hanked in al or in any of tham. Wharefore the wise man biddes in his boke, —Ecclesiast. xxi?.—Als fra the face of the neddir, fand to fle syn, For als the venyme of the nedder slaes mannes bodi, Swa the venyme of syn slaes mannes saule. The first of this seven synnes is pride, That is, a likand heghnesse of a mannes hert Of office, or hegh state, or othir nobillay, That he outhir has of kynd or of grace, Or that he hopes that he has mare than a nothir. And of this syn comes mani sere spices, Bost, and auantyng, and unbuxumnesse, Despite, and ypocrisie, and unshamefulnesse, And othir that er oft sithe sene omang proude men. The secund dedeli syn is hatten enuy, That is a sorowe and a site of the welefare, And ioy of the yuel fare of our euen-cristen; Of whilk syn many spices springes and spredes. Ane is hatered to speke or here ought be spoken That may soune un-to gode to tham that we hate: Anothir is false iuggeyng or dome of thair dedis, And ay turne until yuel that thai do to gode; The third is bacbityng, to sai behynd tham That we wil noght auow ne say befor tham, Whare noght anely he that spekes the yuel, Bot he that heres it be spoken, is for to blame, For war thar no herer, thar wer no bacbiter. The third dedely syn or heued syn is wrath, That is, a wiked stirryng or bolnyng of hert Whare-thurgh a man wilnesse for to take wrake Or wickedly to venge him opon his euen-cristen, And of this syn comes striuyng, and flityng, With mony fals and mony foule wordes; Sklaundir, for to fordo a mannes gode fame, Feghtyng, and felony and oft mannes slaughter, And many ma than now is nede to be neuened. The ferthe dedeli syn is glotony, That is ane unskilwise likyng, or loue, In taste, or in takyng of mete and of drynk; And this trespas dos men opon sere wise. Ane is ouer areli or ouer late, or ouer oftt sithes For to ete or to drynk, bot if nede ger it; Anothir is for to lyue ouer delicately; The third is for to ete or drink ouer mikel; The ferthe is ouer hastily to ete or to drynk; The fift is to compas upon what wise We may gete deliciouse metes and drynkes, For to fill the likyngs and lustes of the flesh, Othir than we may godely lede our lyve with. Unde versus, Prepropere, laute, nimis, ardenter, studiose. The fift dedely syn is covatise, that is a urang-wise wilnyng Or yernyng to hafe any kyns gode that us augh noght, and this is principaly done opon twyn wise: Ane is wrangwisely to gete any thing That oure likyng or oure loue lightes opon, Als be sacrilege, or be symonie, Stalthe, falshede, or oker, or othir gilery, Whilk this worldis men is wont for to use, That castes thaire conandnesse so unto couatise That thai ne reck whethir it be bi right, or bi wrang, Bot at thai mai gete that at thaire hert yhernes. Anothir is wrangwisely to hald that is geten; That is when we will noght do to god almighten, Ne til halikirk, ne til our euen-cristen, That us augh for to do bi dett and by lawe, Bot anely haldes that we have, for ese of us selven; Whare noght anely he that wrangwisely getes, Bot he that wrangwisely haldes, falles in the syn. The sext dedely syn is slauthe or slawnes, That is ane hertly anger or anoye til us Of any gastely gode that we sal do, And of this syn comes sum sere speces; Ane is latsumnesse or lite to draw opon lenthe Any gode dede that we sal do, That mai turne us til help or hele of our saules. Anothir is a dulnesse or heuynesse of hert That lettes us for to luf our lord god almighten, Or any likyng to haue in his seruice. The third is yde[l]ship that ouer mikel is haunted, That makes men lathe to begyn any godededis, And lightely dos us to leue when ought is begunnen, And thar ar we er kyndely borne for to swink Als the foughel is kindly born for to flegh, Job. v??. ca?.It haldes us euermare in ese ogaynes our kynd, For idelnesse is enmy to cristen man saule Stepmodir and stameryng ogayne gode thewes, And witter wissyng and wai till alkyns vices. The seuent dedely syn is lecheri, That is a foule likyng or lust of the flesch; And of this syn comes many sere spices. Ane is fornication, a fleshly syn Betwix ane aynlepi man, and ane aynlepi woman, That forthi that it is ogaynes the lawe And the leue, and the lare that hali kirk haldes, It is dedely syn to tham that dos it. An other is auoutry, that is spousebrek, Whether it be bodily or it be gastely, That greuouser and gretter is than that othir. The third is incest, that is when a man synnes Fleshly with any of his sib frend, Or any othir that is of his affinite, Gastely or bodili, whethir so it be. Othir spices many ma springes of this syn, That ouer mikel er knawen and kennd in the werld, With tham that ledis thair lifs als thaire flesch yhernes. This er the sex thinges that I have spoken of, That the lawe of halikirk lies mast in That ye er al halden to knawe, and to kun, If ye sal knawe god almighten, and cum un-to his blisse: And for to gif yhou better will for to kun tham, Our fadir the ercebisshop grauntes of his grace Fourti daies of pardon til al that kunnes tham, Or dos thair gode diligence for to kun tham, And ratifies als-so that othir men gifes, So mikel couaites he the hele of yhour saules, For if ye kunnandly knaw this ilk sex thinges Thurgh thaim sal ye kun knawe god almighten, Wham, als saint Iohn saies in his godspel, Conandly for to knawe swilk als he is, It is endeles life and lastand blisse, To whilk blisse he bring us [,that bought us]. amen.

Of alle þe creaturis þat god made in heuyn and in erthe in water and in eyre. or in ou?t ellys. þe souerayne cause and þe skyle why he made hem Was his owne god wyl and his goo[d]nesse. thorw þe whiche godnesse. as he ys al good. he wolde þat sum creaturis of þo þat he made were commeneris of þat blys þat euyr lastys. And for no creature mi?t come to þat blys withoute knowynge of god as þe clerk techys. he made skylful creaturis as angelys and man of wit and of wisdom to know god almy?ty. and thorw? his knowynge loue hym and serue hym and so come to þat blysse / þat þey were made to. This maner of knowynge had oure former faderys in þe stat of innocence. þat þey were mad yn. þat we schuld haue had? yf þey had not synned. But not so-mokyl as holy sowlys haue now in heuen. but mochyl more þen any man has now in erthe. For oure former faderis synned says þe prophete. and we bere þe wykkydnesse of þair mysdedys. for knowing þat þey hadde of god almy?thy? þey hadde yt of goddys gyfte at þare begynnynge withowte travayl or tray or passynge of tyme. And al þe knawynge þat we haue in þis werld of hym ys of herynge and larnynge. and wyssynge of othyr. of þe lawe and þe lore þat longys at holy chyrche. þe whyche alle creaturis þat loue god almy?ty owe to knowe and lede here lyf þeraftyr. and so come to þat blys þat neuer schal haue ende. and for þat now mekyl folk in this world. ys not wel lernyd to knowe god almy?ty. ne loue hym ne serue hym. as þey schold do. as þayr dedys often tyme opunly schewys in gret perel of þaym to lyf and to sowle. and paraventure þe cawse may be in ham? þat han here sowlys to kepe. and schulde teche þaym. as prelatys. persons. and vycars. and oþer prestys. þat haue take þat offyce. and ar holdyn be dette to lere þaym. And no prestts may be excusid ffor be trew dette þey holdyng to teche þaym And þerfore oure fadyr þe archiepyschop wylle þat alle men knowe god and be saf. for Seynt Poul. seys of god? þat iesu wylle þat alle men be saf and know god almy?ty. and namely þe vndirlynges þat to hym longys. and þerfore he has tretyd and ordeynyd for þe comyn profyt thorow? þo conseyl of hys clergy þat euerych þat vndyr hym has kepyng of sowlys opunly on englysch vpon sundays preche and teche ham? þat þey haue cure of. þe lawe and þe lore to knowe god almy?ty and hys werkys. Pater noster. qui es in celis. We schull be-leue þat þis pater noster. þat crist hym self techis to alle cristyn men. passys oþer prayers in these thre thyngis. In auctorite. In sotylte. and profyt to his chyrche. Hyt passis in auctorite. For crist hym self boþe god and man? made yt and tau?t hyt: for cristyn men to vse hyt. And he ys most of auctorite as oure be-leue techis vs. And here-fore þe gospel of Mathew. seys þat crist bad vs pray thus. M?.6?. Hyt passys also in sotylte. For we schulle vndyrstonde. þat in þese vij askyngkys are conteyned alle þe poyntys of þis world in þe whiche is ony wyt And so schortly to comprehend so moche wyt in playn wordys ys a sotylte of god passyng þe wyt of man. The þrydde we schulle suppose þat no prayer in þe world is more profitable to man sythen þat crist hym self schal here al. The fyrst askynge of þis pater noster stondis in þese wordis Our fadyr þat art in heuyn: halwyd be þy name. In whyche wordys. we mow lerne þat men worthy to be herd? must be knyt in charite. and meknese of herte. sythen al þe holyte (sic) trinite ys fadyr of vs alle and holy chyrche is modyr. we schulde loue as breþern. And sethen god ys so hy? in heuyn a-boue al his angelys. and we be so low in erthe. wrappid with many myscheuys./ we schulde be resoun be meke and buxum to þis lord and mekely pray to oure fadyr þatt halwyd be his name. So as his name ys halowyd nedlych in hym-self? so be hys name halwyd. and stedfast in oure sowle. For whan oure sowle was mad to lyknesse of þe trinte: goddis hy? name was prentyd þeryn. The secunde askynge of þis prayer. stondys in these wordys. Thy reme come to þe, in-to þe blysse of heuyn. In so as þe furste askynge. answerys to þe fadyr? so þe secunde askynge a[n]swerys to þe sone. For he ys þat nobyl man. þat com down in-to erthe to gete hym a Reme. and aftyr to turne a?en. The Reme of þis fadyr ys callyd Holy chyrche. þat at þe day of dome schal go hennys in-to heuyn The thrydde askynge. seyth þus Be thy wylle don. as yt ys fully don in hevyn? so be yt don in erthe. And þis thrydde askynge. answeris to þe holy gost ffor he ys good loue of þe ffadyr. and of þe sone. And al-thaw þese askyngys most nedelynge be fulfyllyd? natheles mannys sowle ys lyfte vp with charite with desyre hey?ed with god. and þat ys a prayer Thus we seye blyssyd be god. and oþer thyngys þat nedis mot be And þese thre askyngys? arn to þe holy Trinite. And þerfore we schape oure wordys only to god. The secunde part of þis prayer conteynes foure askyngys. Furst we preye oure fadyr þus Fadyr oure eche day bred gyf vs to day. And þis may be wel vndirstonde? on þre manerys. as seynt Austyn seyþ be wit of god almy?thy. Furst we aske oure bodely fode? for to serue oure fadyr. aftyr we aske þe sacrament to haue mende of oure Fadyr. And aftyrward we aske goddys word to fede with oure sowle. And for we haue nede of alle þese yche day? þerfore crist callys hem oure eche day bred. and for we schulde be trewe? and ete oure owne bred? [And not in wrong ete our neeghboris breed] þerfore crist techis vs to aske of hym oure bred. And for crist wolde þat oure hope were freschyd in hym? oure thogth and oure mynde. and alle oure desyre? þerfore he byddys vs aske þis mete of hym to day The secunde part of þis askyngge (askynge of þis part) sewyþ in þese wordys. For-?eue vs oure dettys? as we do to oure dettours. These dettys þat we owe to god? ar seruyse þat we owe to hym. And as ofte tymes as we fayle? we renne in-to dette of peyne. and but god for-?eue vs þis dette of synne? we be nat worthy to haue au?t of oure fadyr. And for god wyl þat we loue oure breþeryn. he knyttys to a condicioun vndyr whyche? we aske þis bone. þat he schulde for?eue vs oure dettys; as we for?eue oure dettowrys. So þat ?if we be vn-mercyful to men þat be oure dettours trist we to oure fadyr þat he wyl punysche vs. And so we praye oure hy?e iuge a?ens oure owyn hed. But vndirstonde we. þat we mowe lefully aske of oure broþern dette of erthelyche thyngys. but þis askynge mot be in resoun and charite. And þan yt [is] for charite and loue and profyt to oure ney?ebore. and here we mot fle bothe rancour and hate. and envye to oure [ney?bore] with oþer schrewde castys The thrydde askynge of þis part swyt in these wordys. Oure Fadyr lede vs nat in temptacioun.// Soþ yt ys þat crist was temptyd. and god temptys man for loue. But hard it ys and greuous peyne to be lad in temptacioun. For whan man of his foly. in-to myre of synne fallys. Ry?t jugement of god wol make hym synke deppyr./ And herfore we pray hym our fadyr þat he lede vs nat in-to þis hardnesse of synne lest we come neuer owt. And herfore þe laste askynge sewyþ in þese wordis. But gracius fadyr delyuere vs fro euyl. The worst þynge in þis world is wykkydnesse of synne. Sytthe a man for noþynge schulde wylle to do synne? sythen for al þis world. ne nogt? þer-yn schuld ony man do synne. But sythen sum synnes be moche werse þan sum? In þis last askynge we pray delyueraunce of þe werste synne. The werst synne ys þe deuelys synne þat man deyes yn withoute repentaunce. þat euyr schal be punyschyd. and þat callys þe gospel? synne a?enst þe holy gost. God for his grete mercy? kepe vs fro þis euyl. And þan schulen we haue euer-lastyngge fredam. Amen. Aue Maria. Men gretyþ comunly oure lady goddys moder and we suppose þat þis gretynge sauys many a man For we take as be-leue. þat sche ys blyssyd in heuyn. And crist wyl do at hyr prayynge among al oþyr seyntys. And þow we trow þat noþer crist ne sche wil do for man but yt be resonable. and men þat ben worthy to be holpyn. And so mow men triste to be holpyn fully in suche prayer. In þre partyes comunlyche þis gretynge ys dyuydyd. The furst part contenys þe wordys of Gabriel. whan he seyde to þis lady. Heyl ful of grace? god is with the. The secunde part of þis gretynge buth wordys þat Elysabeth spake to hyr whan sche sayde. Blyssyd be þou amonge wommen. and blyssyd be þe fruyt of þy wombe. The þrydde part has two wordys clowtyd for deuocyoun. Maria. and Iesus./ Furst men seyn. Heyl Marie þat gabryel lefte in his gretynge to teche vs þat he was homly and knowyn with þis lady. and þerfore wold he not nempne þis name of marie. The secunde word ys Iesvs. addyd to ely?abethis wordys and þis word lefte þe gospel here. to teche þat marye hadde but on child. and þis child was iesus. þat is sauiour of man-kynde. But þis fyl longe [aftyr] þat oure lady was gret þus. The furste word. þat is aue. reuersys þe name of Eua to teche vs þat oure lady contraryyd Eue in levynge. For ry?th as Adam and Eue were cause of dampnynge of man-kynde? So iesus and Marie ben cawse of mannys saluacioun. The secunde word of þe angel seys. oure lady was ful of grace. And man may be ful of grace on thre maneris be godys lawe. Furst of hym-self. as crist was þe furst qwyk welle of grace. for of hym spronge grace to alle men aftyr hym. Our lady was ful of grace as a stronde ful of watyr [And] gaf grace plenteous boþe to oþer men and wommen. Seynt Steuyn was ful of grace þat sufficyd to his lyf for to bryng hym to blysse. and so be many oþer seyntys. and so god ys with alle creaturis. But specialy with men þat schul be sauyd. But more specialy with þe chaumbyr of his manhed þat was oure lady marie. But bothe þe Angel and Elyzabeth seyde þat oure lady is blyssid a-mong alle wommen þat be for genderyng of seche a child. And so þe be-gynnynge and þe endynge schuld be blessynge of iesu. Þat is froyt of þe wombe of oure lady seynt Marie. The þridde part of þis gretynge addis two wordys to þe gospel þat ben Maria and iesus and two devowt wordis. But for it ys hard to men to grounde hem leue. to adde þis. sythe godis lawe seys þat men schulde nat vp-on gret peyne. adde to goddys word. Hit ys seyd þat þe pope gefys gret pardoun to men þat addys þese wordys. and be þe same skyle þat men schuld triste to eny pardoun? men schuld triste to þis pardoun. be yt four score dayes or more. And as þe pope may ?eue þis pardoun be addyngge of þese two wordys. so may he adde oþer mo. and with-drawe as hym-self lykys. and so turne godys lawe? in-to lawe of antecrist. Oþer men moste graunt þis way. or say þat þis was furst [a] defawte kept to þe pope to amende. And herfore thynkys men þat þe wordys of þe gospel were wysly set in þe gospel with-owte varyynge. And many men thynkys ouer [?] ?if suche pardoun my?t be grauntyd ly?tlyche with lasse travayle yt schuld be grauntyd generaly to men þat devowtly sey þese names.

Hyt ys soþ. þat beleue is ground of alle vertues. and þerfore eche cristyn man schulde be sad in beleue. Ther be þre credys in þe chirche. Crede of þe apostelys. and Crede of þe chyrche. and Crede of attanasy. þat was a gret doctour. But of þe fyrste Crede schulde cristyn men speke. For yt is more comyn and more schortyr þan eny oþer. Ne bysy we vs nat what þe apostyl made. ne what party of þis holy Crede. and whan þe apostelys gaderyd yt. For oure beleue techis vs þat god ordeynyd hyt al. and bad þat men schuld cun hyt and teche yt to oþer And ?if prelatys faylyn in þis Crist seyde þat stonys schulde crye and secler lordys schuld in defawte of prelatys lerne and preche þe law of god in here modyr tonge. Ne study we nat how many partyes ben in þis holy crede. For soþ it is? þat alle þese partyes ben contenyd in thre.

And eche on of þese thre partyes contenys many partyclys (artycles). But we schul wele wyte? þat þese thre thyngys ben wel sotel and diuers. Trow in god. and [trow] to god. and trow god þat ys þe leste. þat man levys in god? þat cleuys to him be charite. and þus eche man þat ys in hed synne. is owt of his beleue. That man trowys to god. þat beleuyþ þat he is trewe and ry?tful in al þyng þat he seyþ. And þus do vnkende men þat trow not in hym. That man trowys god? þat trowys þat he ys. and so do deuelys þat trow not in hym. The fyrst part of þis Crede? conteynys þre artyculys. Furst þat men schulde trow in þe fyrst person þat ys þe fadyr of heuyn and power of god. and so schulde men trowe þat he is al-my?ty.

Amen. .vij. opera spiritualia misericordie Þer be seuen werkys of gostly mercy. þat god chargis more þan þe werkys of bodily mercy. and þey be bettyr and esyer to fulfylle. The fyrst is to teche men þat be vncunnynge of goddys lawe. The secunde is to counseyl men in dowte whiche is sekyr. wey to plese god. The þridde ys to chastyse hem þat be rebel a?enst godis comaundementys. þe ferthe is to conforte men. þat be in care and disese. The fyfte is to for-?eue rancour of herte. hate. and envye The sexte is to suffre paciently. whan men be out of pacience, resoun and mesoure. The seuent and þe last is to pray erly and late for oure enmys. as crist byddys in þe gospel. Euery man pore and riche may do alle þese? whaneuer he wyl in o maner or in anoþer. and he is neuer þe porer. and þey bryngge sowlys out of mischefys of synne. Therfore as þe sowle is better þan þe body? So þese gostly mercyes be better þan þe bodyly mercyes. A / lord how cursyd be þey. þat may ly?tly do þese werkys of gostly mercy and do not. sythen þey be so cursyd of god þat do nat þe werkys of bodyly mercy. þat ar not so esy ne so profytable. But how moche more be þei cursyd of god? þat bynde hem-self wilfully. and takyn moche mede to do þese werkys of gostly mercy. As do Curatis and prelatis. and ?it do hem nat. but lettys oþer men to fulfylle hem be feynyd iurisdictioun whan þey hem-self may not. con not. or wyl not. for worldly bysynesse or ese of here body. hyt semyþ be many resonys. þat þey be more cursyd þan scariot or Symon magus. and deppyr schul be dampnyd. but yf þey amend hem fully in þis lyf. Septem virtutes. The fyfte þyng of þe sex to know god almy?ty is þe .vij. vertues þat holy writ techys. Of whiche seuen þre þe (sic) fyrste þat be souerayne vertues we owe for to haue toward god almy?ty. And þe oþer foure techyn vs so for to lyue? þat yt be lykynge to god and to man. The furste vertu is Feyþ. wher-by we trowe only in god. þat alle þyngys made with alle þe artyclys? þat y be-fore seyde. And þis is nedful to alle þat tristyly lyuys. For trewthe is begynnyge of alle gode werkys./ But noþer trewthe withoute good werke/ ne good werk with-outyn trewthe may plese god almy?ty. The secund vertu is Hope. þat is a sikyr bydyng of gostly good þorw? godis goodnesse? and oure owne good dedys. For to come to þat blysse þat neuer schal haue ende. Not only in trust of goddis goodnesse? ne al only in trust of oure good dedys. but in trust of hem bothe? whan þey be bothe to-gydyr. For neyþer schal we falle so far in wanhope / þat we ne schal truste to haue þat blysse. yf we wel do. Ne we schal nat truste so fer in þe mercy of god: þat we leue goode dedys vn-don. For with oute goode dedys? we come neuer into heuyn. and but we holde specialy þe byddyng of god þe þyrde vertu is Charite. þe whiche ys fulnesse of loue to god almy?ty and to oure euyn-cristyn./ To god almy?ty as for hym-self. and to oure euyn-cristyn for god almy?ty. For þat on may not be louyd? withoutyn þat oþer. For as Seynt Jon seyþ in his Pystyl. þat comaundement we haue of god. þat who-so euer louys god? lovys his euyn cristyn. For ho þat louyþ nat his broþer whom he may se; how schold he loue god. whom he seys nat. The ferthe vertu ys Ry?twysnesse. þat is to ?elde to alle men þat. þat we owe hem. and for to do. to eche man? þat vs owe. Fyrst? for to ?eld to god seruyse þat we be-heet hym whan we tok cristyndom and to kepe his comaundementys be-fore alle oþer thyngys. And study we al oure herte? to do aftyr his counseyl. and so to plese hym. and fulfylle his wyl. in al þat euer we mowe. for to haue þank of hym. and to gete of hym oure mede. for þat ys souerayne ry?twisnesse. And aftyrward to worschype ham þat be worthy. þat is þo þat loue god. and leue good lyf? aftyr goddys lawe. Not worschipe men for here worldly rychesse. as þe fals world doþ? for þey be mysdoers. sotel. and slyhtful dys seyuers. Ne worschipe not men for here fayre cloþes. ne for here qweynte schappis þat sum men vsen. and sey þe cloþis make hem holy. And forþermore þey make sum men beleue þat who so euer deys in here abyte of hire ordre? þat he schal neuer go to helle. And sum men þynke þat þis is a ful parlows heresy. For to make men to trowe in fals thyngys. þat may not helpe hem to here saluacioun. For þan my?t a man synne how-euer hym lyst. and leue so in dedly synne tyl hys endyng day. and neuer forthynk his synne. ne make satisfaccion of goodys þat he haþ stole of oþer mennys. but kast on suche a cope and dye þer-yn. and þan his synnys schul be for?eue hym? as fro þe peyne of helle But þis lernyng is a?en ry?twisnesse. seþyn ry?twys god techys þe contrary. For god and alle his seyntys. and oure beleue techis vs? Þat who-so-euer brekys godys comandementys wilfully. and leuyþ in pride. and in lecchery. and stelys his ney?ebours goodys? And haþ no repentaunce for þese synnys in his laste ende? ne makys no satisfaccion yf he may of þe stole goodys neþer in dede. ne in wyl. ne in tho?t? Þat he mot verilyche go to helle./ euery (euer) with-oute ende. Þow he deyde in alle þe abytys and alle þe vestimentys in cristyndom ?e? þow he hadde vp-on hym in his deþ? þe cloþ þat crist weryd here in erthe in his manhed þat be resun was neuer worldly cloþ so holy And furþer more ho-so-euer had synnyd in alle þese wyse. and lefte his synne with ful repentaunce and perfyt wylle neuermore to synne eft-sonys dedly with satisfaccion to his euyn-cristyn? as is trew god / he most saue hym þorw? his ry?twysnesse. and his mercy. For on þis wyse stondys ful remyssion of synne. and þerfore ho-so-euer behotys eny man to come to heuyn thorw? for?euenesse of synne but on þis wyse he is vnry?twys and fals in his seyynge. For yf he sey he schal not come in helle and he deye in here abyte of here ordre? þan most he wel wyte? þat he schuld to heuyn at þe day of dom. and holy wryt seyþ. þat noman wot whydyr he may be worþy to haue hate or loue of god. And holy wryt may nat be fals? þan ys he fals þat þus techys? þat who-euer deyes in here abyte schal neuer go to helle. But trew men and meke men þynke yt were more tokyn of holynesse to dey withouten ony cloþynge? or ellys in a pore cloþynge to schew oþer ensample. whiche þey schul be. and to schew hem meknesse and porenesse to stoppe pride. and þat we com bare in-to þis world and bare schul we passe But yf we be cloþyd in oure sowle with vertues and holy lyuynge And þerfore ry?twisnesse wyl not þat we worschipe men. for here cloþynge. but only for here fayre vertues. and here clene lyf. for to helpe þat pore þat be nedy. and to amend synful men as þe gospel seys. to do wrong to no man. but to do þat skyl is to eche man. The v. vertu ys warnesse. and sley?te. in god to know þe goode fro þe yuyl. and to depart hem in two. and for to hate þe euyl? and loue þe goode. and of two goode þyngys to chese þe bettyr. The sexte vertu ys Strengthe not only of þe body. but also of þe herte. and of þe wyl. Stalworthly. and tholedmodly. to suffre wo and wele. seknesse and hele. tribulacioun and temptacioun. mekly to suffre? wheþer so falle wo or wele. and þat oure herte be not to hy?. for no welfare. ne to heuy? for no euyl fare. But styfly to stond a?en our foys bodyly and gostly. so þat no foly fondyng make vs to falle ne to be fals in oure feyþ a?enst almy?ty god. But hertely in godes querel to withstonde yn our Euyn-cristyn in al þat we may./ The seuent vertu. and þe laste ys Mesure. þat kepys vs fro vtrage and holhis vs in Euynhede. and lettys fowl lykyng. and lustys of þis flesch. and kepeþ vs in clennesse of þe body and sowle For mesure ys mede to vs in al þat we do. ?if we lyue skylfully as goddys lawe vs teches. Septem peccata mortalia. The sexte þyng. and þe laste to know god almy?ty ys. þe seuen of hed synnys. or dedly. þat euery man ow to know to fle and forsake. For noman may fle hem? but he know hem These þey arn./ Pryde. Envye./ Wrathe./ Glotonye. Couetyse. Slewþe./ and Leccherye. Herfore þey be clepyd? þe seuen hed synnys. For al oþer synnys. comyþ of hem. and þey be callyd dedly synnys. For þey sle gostly euery mannys sowle. þat is bound in ham. For þat synnys in On? synnys in alle. wherfore þis man Ecclesiastes. byddys in his boke. As fro þe Neddyrys face fonde to fle synne./ For as þe venym of þe neddyr? sleys mannys body? So þe venym of þe synne? sleys mannys sowle. The fyrste of þese synnes ys Pryde. þat ys alykyng (sic) of mannys herte and heynesse of offycys. or of hey stat. or nobleye þat he has of kyn. kende. or of grace. or þat he wenys. he haue more þan anoþer. And of þis synne? cometh many sere spicys. Bostynge. Auaunt-makyng. vnbuxumnesse. despit. and ypocrisy. proud schame. and fool drede. and oþer many þat regne among prowd men. The secunde synne ys. brennynge Envye þat is a sorwe and forþynkynge of oþerys welfare. and ioy. and a lykyng of here evyl fare. wheþer þey be frendys or foys. And her-of comys many spycis. On ys hatred to speke or here ow?t be spokyn. þat may sowne in-to good to hem þat þey hatyn./ Anoþer is fals Iugginge. or demynge of here dedys þat þey hate. and alwey to euyl? þat þey do to goode The þrydde ys bakbytynge. to sey behynd a man? þat he wyl not sey. ne avowe be fore hym. For nat only he þat spekys þe euyl? but he þat herys yt spokyn. synnyþ þer-yn. For were þer noon hererys? þer were noon bakbyters The thryd dedly synne ys. Wrath. þat is a wykkyd sterynge of boldnesse of herte. whe-þorw? a man coueytys to make wreche or wykkydly venge hym on his euyn-cristyn. And of þis comys. stryuynge. and chydynge. with men. fals othys. and many fowl wordys. slaundrys. for to for-do a mannys good fame fy?tyng and felony and ofte manslaw?ter. and many mo þan her be rekenyd The ferthe dedly syn ys Glotony þat is an vnskylful lykyng or loue in tast. or tastynge of mete or drynke. and her-yn men trespace on many wyse. On is to ete or drynke ouer erly or ouer late. Anoþer for to ete ofte or drynk but nede mak yt Anoþer for to lyue ouer delycatly. to ete or drynke ouer mokyl or ouer hastly. or to kast on what wyse we may gete delycious mete. or drynke. for to fulfylle þe lykyng and þe lust of þe flesche/ oþer þan we may goodly lede oure lyf with. The fyfte dedly synne ys Couetyse. þat is a wrongwys ?ernynge. to haue ony maner good þat vs owyþ not. and þis is pryncipaly don? on two wyses. On is wrongfully to gete ony þyng þat oure lykynge or oure lust? lustys vp-on. as be Sacrilege or Symony. Stelyng.

But only holde þat we haue to oure owne ese. Not only we synne in Couetyse but also in slewþe. and not only he þat wrongfully getys but also he þat wrongfully holdys / fallys in þat synne The .vi. ys. accidys./ þat is slownesse. whan a man schuld do a good dede hastly and with good wil. for þe loue of god. drawith yt on lengthe and heuy is þer-with and ys hertles in eny gostly good þat he schuld do. and of þis syn. comys many sere spycis. On is latsumnesse or delyt to draw on lenthe ony maner good dede þat we schuld do þat may turne vs to helpe of oure sowlys Anoþer is ydilnesse or heuynesse of herte þat lettyþ vs for to loue our lord god almy?ty: or eny lykyng to haue in his seruyse. Anoþer ys coldnesse of herte and ydylschip þat ouer mekyl is vsyd þat maketh vs loþ to be-gyn ony good dede. and ly?tly maketh vs to leue of whan eny is begunne. and þerfore we be kendly born to swynke? as þe foul is born to fle kendly. hyt holdys vs euermore in ese passynge kende. For ydylnesse is enmy to mannys sowle. stoppynge and staunchyng grace and good thewys. and hit is witte wyssynge and wey to al maner synnes. and vices. The vij. dedly synne and þe laste ys leccherye þat is stynkynge lykyng or lust of þe flesche. and of þis syn comyþ many sere spicys. On is fornicacioun of fleschly synne be-twene a sengyl man and a sengyl womman and for þat is gayn þe law. and leue and þe lore / þat holy chirche holdis? yt is dedly synne to hem þat doþ yt. Anoþer is avowtri. þat ys spowse-brekynge wheþer it be bodyly or gostly. wel greuouser yt is and gretter þan þe oþer./ The þridde is Incest. þat is whan a man synnyþ fleschly with ony of hys kyn. or ony oþer þat is of his affynyte gostly or bodyly whedyr so yt be.
