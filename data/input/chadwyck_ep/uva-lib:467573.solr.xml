      <field name="fulltext">The Pedlar Him had I seen the day before, alone And in the middle of the public way Standing to rest himself. His eyes were turned Towards the setting sun, while, with that staff Behind him fixed, he propped a long white pack Which crossed his shoulders, wares for maids who live In lonely villages or straggling huts. I knew him—he was born of lowly race On Cumbrian hills, and I have seen the tear Stand in his luminous eye when he described The house in which his early youth was passed, And found I was no stranger to the spot. I loved to hear him talk of former days And tell how when a child, ere yet of age To be a shepherd, he had learned to read His bible in a school that stood alone, Sole building on a mountain's dreary edge, Far from the sight of city spire, or sound Of minster clock. From that bleak tenement He many an evening to his distant home In solitude returning saw the hills Grow larger in the darkness, all alone Beheld the stars come out above his head, And travelled through the wood, no comrade near To whom he might confess the things he saw. So the foundations of his mind were laid. In such communion, not from terror free, While yet a child, and long before his time, He had perceived the presence and the power Of greatness, and deep feelings had impressed Great objects on his mind with portraiture And colour so distinct that on his mind They lay like substances, and almost seemed To haunt the bodily sense. He had received A precious gift, for as he grew in years With these impressions would he still compare All his ideal stores, his shapes and forms, And, being still unsatisfied with aught Of dimmer character, he thence attained An active power to fasten images Upon his brain, and on their pictured lines Intensely brooded, even till they acquired The liveliness of dreams. Nor did he fail, While yet a child, with a child's eagerness Incessantly to turn his ear and eye On all things which the rolling seasons brought To feed such appetite. Nor this alone Appeased his yearning—in the after day Of boyhood, many an hour in caves forlorn And in the hollow depths of naked crags He sate, and even in their fixed lineaments, Or from the power of a peculiar eye, Or by creative feeling overborne, Or by predominance of thought oppressed, Even in their fixed and steady lineaments He traced an ebbing and a flowing mind, Expression ever varying. Thus informed, He had small need of books; for many a tale Traditionary round the mountains hung, And many a legend peopling the dark woods Nourished imagination in her growth, And gave the mind that apprehensive power By which she is made quick to recognize The moral properties and scope of things. But greedily he read and read again Whate'er the rustic vicar's shelf supplied: The life and death of martyrs who sustained Intolerable pangs, and here and there A straggling volume, torn and incomplete, Which left half-told the preternatural tale, Romance of giants, chronicle of fiends, Profuse in garniture of wooden cuts Strange and uncouth, dire faces, figures dire, Sharp-kneed, sharp-elbowed, and lean-ankled too, With long and ghostly shanks, forms which once seen Could never be forgotten—things though low, Though low and humble, not to be despised By such as have observed the curious links With which the perishable hours of life Are bound together, and the world of thought Exists and is sustained. Within his heart Love was not yet, nor the pure joy of love, By sound diffused, or by the breathing air, Or by the silent looks of happy things, Or flowing from the universal face Of earth and sky. But he had felt the power Of Nature, and already was prepared By his intense conceptions to receive Deeply the lesson deep of love, which he Whom Nature, by whatever means, has taught To feel intensely, cannot but receive. Ere his ninth year he had been sent abroad To tend his father's sheep; such was his task Henceforward till the later day of youth. Oh then what soul was his, when on the tops Of the high mountains he beheld the sun Rise up and bathe the world in light. He looked, The ocean and the earth beneath him lay In gladness and deep joy. The clouds were touched, And in their silent faces he did read Unutterable love. Sound needed none, Nor any voice of joy: his spirit drank The spectacle. Sensation, soul, and form, All melted into him; they swallowed up His animal being. In them did he live, And by them did he live—they were his life. In such access of mind, in such high hour Of visitation from the living God, He did not feel the God, he felt his works. Thought was not; in enjoyment it expired. Such hour by prayer or praise was unprofaned; He neither prayed, nor offered thanks or praise; His mind was a thanksgiving to the power That made him. It was blessedness and love. A shepherd on the lonely mountain-tops, Such intercourse was his, and in this sort Was his existence oftentimes possessed. Oh then how beautiful, how bright, appeared The written promise. He had early learned To reverence the volume which displays The mystery, the life which cannot die, But in the mountains did he feel his faith, There did he see the writing. All things there Breathed immortality, revolving life, And greatness still revolving, infinite. There littleness was not, the least of things Seemed infinite, and there his spirit shaped Her prospects—nor did he believe; he saw. What wonder if his being thus became Sublime and comprehensive? Low desires, Low thoughts, had there no place; yet was his heart Lowly, for he was meek in gratitude Oft as he called to mind those exstacies, And whence they flowed; and from them he acquired Wisdom which works through patience—thence he learned In many a calmer hour of sober thought To look on Nature with an humble heart, Self-questioned where it did not understand, And with a superstitious eye of love. Thus passed the time, yet to the neighbouring town He often went with what small overplus His earnings might supply, and brought away The book which most had tempted his desires While at the stall he read. Among the hills He gazed upon that mighty orb of song, The divine Milton. Lore of different kind, The annual savings of a toilsome life, The schoolmaster supplied—books that explain The purer elements of truth involved In lines and numbers, and by charm severe, Especially perceived where Nature droops And feeling is suppressed, preserve the mind Busy in solitude and poverty. And thus employed he many a time o'erlooked The listless hours when in the hollow vale, Hollow and green, he lay on the green turf In lonesome idleness. What could he do? Nature was at his heart, and he perceived, Though yet he knew not how, a wasting power In all things which from her sweet influence Might tend to wean him. Therefore with her hues, Her forms, and with the spirit of her forms, He clothed the nakedness of austere truth. While yet he lingered in the elements Of science, and among her simplest laws, His triangles they were the stars of heaven, The silent stars; his altitudes the crag Which is the eagle's birth-place, or some peak Familiar with forgotten years which shews Inscribed, as with the silence of the thought, Upon its bleak and visionary sides The history of many a winter storm, Or obscure records of the path of fire. Yet with these lonesome sciences he still Continued to amuse the heavier hours Of solitude. Yet not the less he found In cold elation, and the lifelessness Of truth by oversubtlety dislodged From grandeur and from love, an idle toy, The dullest of all toys. He saw in truth A holy spirit and a breathing soul; He reverenced her and trembled at her look, When with a moral beauty in her face She led him through the worlds. But now, before his twentieth year was passed, Accumulated feelings pressed his heart With an encreasing weight; he was o'erpowered By Nature, and his spirit was on fire With restless thoughts. His eye became disturbed, And many a time he wished the winds might rage When they were silent. Far more fondly now Than in his earlier season did he love Tempestuous nights, the uproar and the sounds That live in darkness. From his intellect, And from the stillness of abstracted thought, He sought repose in vain. I have heard him say That at this time he scanned the laws of light Amid the roar of torrents, where they send From hollow clefts up to the clearer air A cloud of mist, which in the shining sun Varies its rainbow hues. But vainly thus, And vainly by all other means he strove To mitigate the fever of his heart. From Nature and her overflowing soul He had received so much that all his thoughts Were steeped in feeling. He was only then Contented when with bliss ineffable He felt the sentiment of being spread O'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still, O'er all which, lost beyond the reach of thought And human knowledge, to the human eye Invisible, yet liveth to the heart; O'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings, Or beats the gladsome air; o'er all that glides Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself, And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not If such his transports were; for in all things He saw one life, and felt that it was joy. One song they sang, and it was audible— Most audible then when the fleshly ear, O'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain, Forgot its functions, and slept undisturbed. These things he had sustained in solitude Even till his bodily strength began to yield Beneath their weight. The mind within him burnt, And he resolved to quit his native hills. The father strove to make his son perceive As clearly as the old man did himself With what advantage he might teach a school In the adjoining village. But the youth, Who of this service made a short essay, Found that the wanderings of his thought were then A misery to him, that he must resign A task he was unable to perform. He asked his father's blessing, and assumed This lowly occupation. The old man Blessed him and prayed for him, yet with a heart Forboding evil. From his native hills He wandered far. Much did he see of men, Their manners, their enjoyments and pursuits, Their passions and their feelings, chiefly those Essential and eternal in the heart, Which mid the simpler forms of rural life Exist more simple in their elements, And speak a plainer language. Many a year Of lonesome meditation and impelled By curious thought he was content to toil In this poor calling, which he now pursued From habit and necessity. He walked Among the impure haunts of vulgar men Unstained; the talisman of constant thought And kind sensations in a gentle heart Preserved him. Every shew of vice to him Was a remembrancer of what he knew, Or a fresh seed of wisdom, or produced That tender interest which the virtuous feel Among the wicked, which when truly felt May bring the bad man nearer to the good, But, innocent of evil, cannot sink The good man to the bad. Among the woods A lone enthusiast, and among the hills, Itinerant in this labour he had passed The better portion of his time, and there From day to day had his affections breathed The wholesome air of Nature; there he kept In solitude and solitary thought, So pleasant were those comprehensive views, His mind in a just equipoise of love. Serene it was, unclouded by the cares Of ordinary life—unvexed, unwarped By partial bondage. In his steady course No piteous revolutions had he felt, No wild varieties of joy or grief. Unoccupied by sorrow of its own, His heart lay open; and, by Nature tuned And constant disposition of his thoughts To sympathy with man, he was alive To all that was enjoyed where'er he went, And all that was endured; and, in himself Happy, and quiet in his chearfulness, He had no painful pressure from within Which made him turn aside from wretchedness With coward fears. He could afford to suffer With those whom he saw suffer. Hence it was That in our best experience he was rich, And in the wisdom of our daily life. For hence, minutely, in his various rounds He had observed the progress and decay Of many minds, of minds and bodies too— The history of many families, And how they prospered, how they were o'erthrown By passion or mischance, or such misrule Among the unthinking masters of the earth As makes the nations groan. He was a man, One whom you could not pass without remark— If you had met him on a rainy day You would have stopped to look at him. Robust, Active, and nervous, was his gait; his limbs And his whole figure breathed intelligence. His body, tall and shapely, shewed in front A faint line of the hollowness of age, Or rather what appeared the curvature Of toil; his head looked up steady and fixed. Age had compressed the rose upon his cheek Into a narrower circle of deep red, But had not tamed his eye, which, under brows Of hoary grey, had meanings which it brought From years of youth, which, like a being made Of many beings, he had wondrous skill To blend with meanings of the years to come, Human, or such as lie beyond the grave. Long had I loved him. Oh, it was most sweet To hear him teach in unambitious style Reasoning and thought, by painting as he did The manners and the passions. Many a time He made a holiday and left his pack Behind, and we two wandered through the hills A pair of random travellers. His eye Flashing poetic fire he would repeat The songs of Burns, or many a ditty wild Which he had fitted to the moorland harp— His own sweet verse—and as we trudged along, Together did we make the hollow grove Ring with our transports. Though he was untaught, In the dead lore of schools undisciplined, Why should he grieve? He was a chosen son. He yet retained an ear which deeply felt The voice of Nature in the obscure wind, The sounding mountain, and the running stream. From deep analogies by thought supplied, Or consciousnesses not to be subdued, To every natural form, rock, fruit, and flower, Even the loose stones that cover the highway, He gave a moral life; he saw them feel, Or linked them to some feeling. In all shapes He found a secret and mysterious soul, A fragrance and a spirit of strange meaning. Though poor in outward shew, he was most rich: He had a world about him—'twas his own, He made it—for it only lived to him, And to the God who looked into his mind. Such sympathies would often bear him far In outward gesture, and in visible look, Beyond the common seeming of mankind. Some called it madness; such it might have been, But that he had an eye which evermore Looked deep into the shades of difference As they lie hid in all exterior forms, Near or remote, minute or vast—an eye Which from a stone, a tree, a withered leaf, To the broad ocean and the azure heavens Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars, Could find no surface where its power might sleep— Which spake perpetual logic to his soul, And by an unrelenting agency Did bind his feelings even as in a chain. Tintern Abbey Five years have passed, five summers, with the length Of five long winters, and again I hear These waters rolling from their mountain-springs With a sweet inland murmur. Once again Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs, Which on a wild secluded scene impress Thoughts of more deep seclusion, and connect The landscape with the quiet of the sky. The day is come when I again repose Here under this dark sycamore, and view These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts Which at this season, with their unripe fruits, Among the woods and copses lose themselves, Nor with their green and simple hue disturb The wild green landscape. Once again I see These hedge-rows—hardly hedge-rows, little lines Of sportive wood run wild—these pastoral farms Green to the very door, and wreathes of smoke Sent up in silence from among the trees With some uncertain notice, as might seem, Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, Or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire The hermit sits alone. Though absent long, These forms of beauty have not been to me As is a landscape to a blind man's eye: But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din Of towns and cities, I have owed to them In hours of weariness sensations sweet Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart, And passing even into my purer mind With tranquil restoration—feelings too Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps, As may have had no trivial influence On that best portion of a good man's life, His little nameless unremembered acts Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust, To them I may have owed another gift, Of aspect more sublime: that blessed mood In which the burthen of the mystery, In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world, Is lightened—that serene and blessed mood In which the affections gently lead us on, Until, the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended, we are laid asleep In body and become a living soul, While, with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony and the deep power of joy, We see into the life of things. If this Be but a vain belief, yet oh, how oft In darkness and amid the many shapes Of joyless daylight, when the fretful stir Unprofitable and the fever of the world Have hung upon the beatings of my heart, How oft in spirit have I turned to thee O sylvan Wye—thou wanderer through the woods— How often has my spirit turned to thee! And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought, With many recognitions dim and faint, And somewhat of a sad perplexity, The picture of the mind revives again, While here I stand, not only with the sense Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts That in this moment there is life and food For future years. And so I dare to hope Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first I came among these hills, when like a roe I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides Of the deep rivers and the lonely streams, Wherever Nature led—more like a man Flying from something that he dreads, than one Who sought the thing he loved. For Nature then— The coarser pleasures of my boyish days, And their glad animal movements, all gone by— To me was all in all. I cannot paint What then I was. The sounding cataract Haunted me like a passion; the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to me An appetite—a feeling and a love That had no need of a remoter charm By thought supplied, or any interest Unborrowed from the eye. That time is past, And all its aching joys are now no more, And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this Faint I, nor mourn, nor murmur: other gifts Have followed, for such loss, I would believe, Abundant recompence. For I have learned To look on Nature not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes The still, sad music of humanity, Nor harsh, nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue. And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts, a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean, and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man— A motion and a spirit that impels All thinking things, all objects of all thought, And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still A lover of the meadows and the woods And mountains, and of all that we behold From this green earth—of all the mighty world Of eye and ear, both what they half-create, And what perceive—well pleased to recognize In Nature and the language of the sense The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul Of all my moral being. Nor perchance If I were not thus taught, should I the more Suffer my genial spirits to decay; For thou art with me, here upon the banks Of this fair river, thou, my dearest friend, My dear, dear friend, and in thy voice I catch The language of my former heart, and read My former pleasures in the shooting lights Of thy wild eyes. Oh, yet a little while May I behold in thee what I was once, My dear, dear sister. And this prayer I make, Knowing that Nature never did betray The heart that loved her: 'tis her privilege Through all the years of this our life to lead From joy to joy, for she can so inform The mind that is within us, so impress With quietness and beauty, and so feed With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues, Rash judgements, nor the sneers of selfish men Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all The dreary intercourse of daily life, Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb Our chearful faith that all which we behold Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon Shine on thee in thy solitary walk, And let the misty mountain winds be free To blow against thee; and in after years, When these wild ecstasies shall be matured Into a sober pleasure, when thy mind Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms, Thy memory be as a dwelling-place For all sweet sounds and harmonies, oh, then If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief, Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts Of tender joy wilt thou remember me And these my exhortations. Nor perchance If I should be where I no more can hear Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams Of past existence, wilt thou then forget That on the banks of this delightful stream We stood together, and that I, so long A worshipper of Nature, hither came Unwearied in that service—rather say With warmer love, oh, with far deeper zeal Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget That after many wanderings, many years Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs, And this green pastoral landscape, were to me More dear, both for themselves, and for thy sake. THE TWO-PART PRELUDE First Part Was it for this That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song, And from his alder shades and rocky falls, And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice That flowed along my dreams? For this didst thou, O Derwent, travelling over the green plains Near my ‘sweet birthplace’, didst thou, beauteous stream, Make ceaseless music through the night and day, Which with its steady cadence tempering Our human waywardness, composed my thoughts To more than infant softness, giving me Among the fretful dwellings of mankind A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm Which Nature breathes among the fields and groves? Beloved Derwent, fairest of all streams, Was it for this that I, a four years' child, A naked boy, among thy silent pools Made one long bathing of a summer's day, Basked in the sun, or plunged into thy streams, Alternate, all a summer's day, or coursed Over the sandy fields, and dashed the flowers Of yellow grunsel; or, when crag and hill, The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height, Were bronzed with a deep radiance, stood alone A naked savage in the thunder-shower? And afterwards ('twas in a later day, Though early), when upon the mountain slope The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapped The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy To wander half the night among the cliffs And the smooth hollows where the woodcocks ran Along the moonlight turf. In thought and wish That time, my shoulder all with springes hung, I was a fell destroyer. Gentle powers, Who give us happiness and call it peace, When scudding on from snare to snare I plied My anxious visitation, hurrying on, Still hurrying, hurrying onward, how my heart Panted!—among the scattered yew-trees and the crags That looked upon me, how my bosom beat With expectation! Sometimes strong desire Resistless overpowered me, and the bird Which was the captive of another's toils Became my prey; and when the deed was done I heard among the solitary hills Low breathings coming after me, and sounds Of undistinguishable motion, steps Almost as silent as the turf they trod. Nor less in springtime, when on southern banks The shining sun had from his knot of leaves Decoyed the primrose flower, and when the vales And woods were warm, was I a rover then In the high places, on the lonesome peaks, Among the mountains and the winds. Though mean And though inglorious were my views, the end Was not ignoble. Oh, when I have hung Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass Or half-inch fissures in the slippery rock But ill sustained, and almost, as it seemed, Suspended by the blast which blew amain, Shouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time, While on the perilous ridge I hung alone, With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind Blow through my ears; the sky seemed not a sky Of earth, and with what motion moved the clouds! The mind of man is fashioned and built up Even as a strain of music. I believe That there are spirits which, when they would form A favored being, from his very dawn Of infancy do open out the clouds As at the touch of lightning, seeking him With gentle visitation—quiet powers, Retired, and seldom recognized, yet kind, And to the very meanest not unknown— With me, though rarely, in my boyish days They communed. Others too there are, who use, Yet haply aiming at the self-same end, Severer interventions, ministry More palpable-and of their school was I. They guided me: one evening led by them I went alone into a shepherd's boat, A skiff, that to a willow-tree was tied Within a rocky cave, its usual home. The moon was up, the lake was shining clear Among the hoary mountains; from the shore I pushed, and struck the oars, and struck again In cadence, and my little boat moved on Just like a man who walks with stately step Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth And troubled pleasure. Not without the voice Of mountain echoes did my boat move on, Leaving behind her still on either side Small circles glittering idly in the moon, Until they melted all into one track Of sparkling light. A rocky steep uprose Above the cavern of the willow-tree, And now, as suited one who proudly rowed With his best skill, I fixed a steady view Upon the top of that same craggy ridge, The bound of the horizon—for behind Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky. She was an elfin pinnace; twenty times I dipped my oars into the silent lake, And as I rose upon the stroke my boat Went heaving through the water like a swan— When from behind that rocky steep, till then The bound of the horizon, a huge cliff, As if with voluntary power instinct, Upreared its head. I struck, and struck again, And, growing still in stature, the huge cliff Rose up between me and the stars, and still, With measured motion, like a living thing Strode after me. With trembling hands I turned, And through the silent water stole my way Back to the cavern of the willow-tree. There in her mooring-place I left my bark, And through the meadows homeward went with grave And serious thoughts; and after I had seen That spectacle, for many days my brain Worked with a dim and undetermined sense Of unknown modes of being. In my thoughts There was a darkness—call it solitude, Or blank desertion—no familiar shapes Of hourly objects, images of trees, Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields, But huge and mighty forms that do not live Like living men moved slowly through my mind By day, and were the trouble of my dreams. Ah, not in vain ye beings of the hills, And ye that walk the woods and open heaths By moon or star-light, thus, from my first dawn Of childhood, did ye love to intertwine The passions that build up our human soul Not with the mean and vulgar works of man, But with high objects, with eternal things, With life and Nature, purifying thus The elements of feeling and of thought, And sanctifying by such discipline Both pain and fear, until we recognise A grandeur in the beatings of the heart. Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me With stinted kindness. In November days, When vapours rolling down the valleys made A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods At noon, and mid the calm of summer nights When by the margin of the trembling lake Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward went In solitude, such intercourse was mine. And in the frosty season, when the sun Was set, and visible for many a mile The cottage windows through the twilight blazed, I heeded not the summons. Clear and loud The village clock tolled six; I wheeled about Proud and exulting, like an untired horse That cares not for its home. All shod with steel We hissed along the polished ice in games Confederate, imitative of the chace And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn, The pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare. So through the darkness and the cold we flew, And not a voice was idle. With the din, Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud; The leafless trees and every icy crag Tinkled like iron; while the distant hills Into the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy, not unnoticed; while the stars, Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west The orange sky of evening died away. Not seldom from the uproar I retired Into a silent bay, or sportively Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, To cut across the shadow of a star That gleamed upon the ice. And oftentimes When we had given our bodies to the wind, And all the shadowy banks on either side Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still The rapid line of motion, then at once Have I, reclining back upon my heels, Stopped short—yet still the solitary cliffs Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had rolled With visible motion her diurnal round. Behind me did they stretch in solemn train, Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched Till all was tranquil as a summer sea. Ye powers of earth, ye genii of the springs, And ye that have your voices in the clouds, And ye that are familiars of the lakes And of the standing pools, I may not think A vulgar hope was yours when ye employed Such ministry—when ye through many a year Thus by the agency of boyish sports, On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills, Impressed upon all forms the characters Of danger or desire, and thus did make The surface of the universal earth With meanings of delight, of hope and fear, Work like a sea. Not uselessly employed, I might pursue this theme through every change Of exercise and sport to which the year Did summon us in its delightful round. We were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours, Nor saw a race in happiness and joy More worthy of the fields where they were sown. I would record with no reluctant voice Our home amusements by the warm peat fire At evening, when with pencil and with slate, In square divisions parcelled out, and all With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er, We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head, In strife too humble to be named in verse; Or round the naked table, snow-white deal, Cherry, or maple, sate in close array, And to the combat—lu or whist—led on A thick-ribbed army, not as in the world Discarded and ungratefully thrown by Even for the very service they had wrought, But husbanded through many a long campaign. Oh, with what echoes on the board they fell— Ironic diamonds, hearts of sable hue, Queens gleaming through their splendour's last decay, Knaves wrapt in one assimilating gloom, And kings indignant at the shame incurred By royal visages. Meanwhile abroad The heavy rain was falling, or the frost Raged bitterly with keen and silent tooth, And, interrupting the impassioned game, Oft from the neighbouring lake the splitting ice, While it sank down towards the water, sent Among the meadows and the hills its long And frequent yellings, imitative some Of wolves that howl along the Bothnic main. Nor with less willing heart would I rehearse The woods of autumn, and their hidden bowers With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line— True symbol of the foolishness of hope— Which with its strong enchantment led me on By rocks and pools, where never summer star Impressed its shadow, to forlorn cascades Among the windings of the mountain-brooks; The kite in sultry calms from some high hill Sent up, ascending thence till it was lost Among the fleecy clouds—in gusty days Launched from the lower grounds, and suddenly Dashed headlong and rejected by the storm. All these, and more, with rival claims demand Grateful acknowledgement. It were a song Venial, and such as—if I rightly judge— I might protract unblamed, but I perceive That much is overlooked, and we should ill Attain our object if, from delicate fears Of breaking in upon the unity Of this my argument, I should omit To speak of such effects as cannot here Be regularly classed, yet tend no less To the same point, the growth of mental power And love of Nature's works. Ere I had seen Eight summers—and 'twas in the very week When I was first transplanted to thy vale, Beloved Hawkshead; when thy paths, thy shores And brooks, were like a dream of novelty To my half-infant mind—I chanced to cross One of those open fields which, shaped like ears, Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's lake. Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom I saw distinctly on the opposite shore, Beneath a tree and close by the lake side, A heap of garments, as if left by one Who there was bathing. Half an hour I watched And no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast, And now and then a leaping fish disturbed The breathless stillness. The succeeding day There came a company, and in their boat Sounded with iron hooks and with long poles. At length the dead man, mid that beauteous scene Of trees and hills and water, bolt upright Rose with his ghastly face. I might advert To numerous accidents in flood or field, Quarry or moor, or mid the winter snows, Distresses and disasters, tragic facts Of rural history that impressed my mind With images to which in following years Far other feelings were attached—with forms That yet exist with independent life, And, like their archetypes, know no decay. There are in our existence spots of time Which with distinct preeminence retain A fructifying virtue, whence, depressed By trivial occupations and the round Of ordinary intercourse, our minds— Especially the imaginative power— Are nourished and invisibly repaired. Such moments chiefly seem to have their date In our first childhood. I remember well ('Tis of an early season that I speak, The twilight of rememberable life), While I was yet an urchin, one who scarce Could hold a bridle, with ambitious hopes I mounted, and we rode towards the hills. We were a pair of horsemen: honest James Was with me, my encourager and guide. We had not travelled long ere some mischance Disjoined me from my comrade, and, through fear Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor I led my horse, and stumbling on, at length Came to a bottom where in former times A man, the murderer of his wife, was hung In irons. Mouldered was the gibbet-mast; The bones were gone, the iron and the wood; Only a long green ridge of turf remained Whose shape was like a grave. I left the spot, And reascending the bare slope I saw A naked pool that lay beneath the hills, The beacon on the summit, and more near A girl who bore a pitcher on her head And seemed with difficult steps to force her way Against the blowing wind. It was in truth An ordinary sight, but I should need Colours and words that are unknown to man To paint the visionary dreariness Which, while I looked all round for my lost guide, Did at that time invest the naked pool, The beacon on the lonely eminence, The woman and her garments vexed and tossed By the strong wind. Nor less I recollect— Long after, though my childhood had not ceased— Another scene which left a kindred power Implanted in my mind. One Christmas time, The day before the holidays began, Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth Into the fields, impatient for the sight Of those three horses which should bear us home, My brothers and myself. There was a crag, An eminence, which from the meeting-point Of two highways ascending overlooked At least a long half-mile of those two roads, By each of which the expected steeds might come— The choice uncertain. Thither I repaired Up to the highest summit. 'Twas a day Stormy, and rough, and wild, and on the grass I sate half sheltered by a naked wall. Upon my right hand was a single sheep, A whistling hawthorn on my left, and there, Those two companions at my side, I watched With eyes intensely straining, as the mist Gave intermitting prospects of the wood And plain beneath. Ere I to school returned That dreary time, ere I had been ten days A dweller in my father's house, he died, And I and my two brothers, orphans then, Followed his body to the grave. The event, With all the sorrow which it brought, appeared A chastisement; and when I called to mind That day so lately passed, when from the crag I looked in such anxiety of hope, With trite reflections of morality, Yet with the deepest passion, I bowed low To God who thus corrected my desires. And afterwards the wind and sleety rain, And all the business of the elements, The single sheep, and the one blasted tree, And the bleak music of that old stone wall, The noise of wood and water, and the mist Which on the line of each of those two roads Advanced in such indisputable shapes— All these were spectacles and sounds to which I often would repair, and thence would drink As at a fountain. And I do not doubt That in this later time, when storm and rain Beat on my roof at midnight, or by day When I am in the woods, unknown to me The workings of my spirit thence are brought. Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace How Nature by collateral interest, And by extrinsic passion, peopled first My mind with forms or beautiful or grand And made me love them, may I well forget How other pleasures have been mine, and joys Of subtler origin—how I have felt Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time, Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense Which seem in their simplicity to own An intellectual charm, that calm delight Which, if I err not, surely must belong To those first-born affinities that fit Our new existence to existing things, And, in our dawn of being, constitute The bond of union betwixt life and joy. Yes, I remember when the changeful earth And twice five seasons on my mind had stamped The faces of the moving year, even then, A child, I held unconscious intercourse With the eternal beauty, drinking in A pure organic pleasure from the lines Of curling mist, or from the level plain Of waters coloured by the steady clouds. The sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell How when the sea threw off his evening shade And to the shepherd's hut beneath the crags Did send sweet notice of the rising moon, How I have stood, to images like these A stranger, linking with the spectacle No body of associated forms, And bringing with me no peculiar sense Of quietness or peace—yet I have stood Even while my eye has moved o'er three long leagues Of shining water, gathering, as it seemed, Through the wide surface of that field of light New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers. Thus often in those fits of vulgar joy Which through all seasons on a child's pursuits Are prompt attendants, mid that giddy bliss Which like a tempest works along the blood And is forgotten, even then I felt Gleams like the flashing of a shield. The earth And common face of Nature spake to me Rememberable things—sometimes, 'tis true, By quaint associations, yet not vain Nor profitless, if haply they impressed Collateral objects and appearances, Albeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep Until maturer seasons called them forth To impregnate and to elevate the mind. And if the vulgar joy by its own weight Wearied itself out of the memory, The scenes which were a witness of that joy Remained, in their substantial lineaments Depicted on the brain, and to the eye Were visible, a daily sight. And thus By the impressive agency of fear, By pleasure and repeated happiness— So frequently repeated—and by force Of obscure feelings representative Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes, So beauteous and majestic in themselves, Though yet the day was distant, did at length Become habitually dear, and all Their hues and forms were by invisible links Allied to the affections. I began My story early, feeling, as I fear, The weakness of a human love for days Disowned by memory—ere the birth of spring Planting my snowdrops among winter snows. Nor will it seem to thee, my friend, so prompt In sympathy, that I have lengthened out With fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale. Meanwhile my hope has been that I might fetch Reproaches from my former years, whose power May spur me on, in manhood now mature, To honourable toil. Yet should it be That this is but an impotent desire— That I by such inquiry am not taught To understand myself, nor thou to know With better knowledge how the heart was framed Of him thou lovest—need I dread from thee Harsh judgements if I am so loth to quit Those recollected hours that have the charm Of visionary things, and lovely forms And sweet sensations, that throw back our life And make our infancy a visible scene On which the sun is shining? Second Part Thus far, my friend, have we retraced the way Through which I travelled when I first began To love the woods and fields. The passion yet Was in its birth, sustained, as might befal, By nourishment that came unsought—for still From week to week, from month to month, we lived A round of tumult. Duly were our games Prolonged in summer till the daylight failed: No chair remained before the doors, the bench And threshold steps were empty, fast asleep The labourer and the old man who had sate A later lingerer, yet the revelry Continued and the loud uproar. At last, When all the ground was dark and the huge clouds Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went With weary joints and with a beating mind. Ah, is there one who ever has been young And needs a monitory voice to tame The pride of virtue and of intellect? And is there one, the wisest and the best Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish For things which cannot be, who would not give, If so he might, to duty and to truth The eagerness of infantine desire? A tranquillizing spirit presses now On my corporeal frame, so wide appears The vacancy between me and those days, Which yet have such self-presence in my heart That sometimes when I think of them I seem Two consciousnesses—conscious of myself, And of some other being. A grey stone Of native rock, left midway in the square Of our small market-village, was the home And centre of these joys; and when, returned After long absence thither I repaired, I found that it was split and gone to build A smart assembly-room that perked and flared With wash and rough-cast, elbowing the ground Which had been ours. But let the fiddle scream, And be ye happy! Yet I know, my friends, That more than one of you will think with me Of those soft starry nights, and that old dame From whom the stone was named, who there had sate And watched her table with its huckster's wares, Assiduous, for the length of sixty years. We ran a boisterous race, the year span round With giddy motion; but the time approached That brought with it a regular desire For calmer pleasures—when the beauteous scenes Of Nature were collaterally attached To every scheme of holiday delight, And every boyish sport, less grateful else And languidly pursued. When summer came It was the pastime of our afternoons To beat along the plain of Windermere With rival oars; and the selected bourn Was now an island musical with birds That sang for ever, now a sister isle Beneath the oak's umbrageous covert, sown With lilies-of-the-valley like a field, And now a third small island where remained An old stone table and one mouldered cave— A hermit's history. In such a race, So ended, disappointment could be none, Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy; We rested in the shade, all pleased alike, Conquered or conqueror. Thus our selfishness Was mellowed down, and thus the pride of strength And the vainglory of superior skill Were interfused with objects which subdued And tempered them, and gradually produced A quiet independence of the heart. And to my friend who knows me I may add, Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence Ensued a diffidence and modesty, And I was taught to feel—perhaps too much— The self-sufficing power of solitude. No delicate viands sapped our bodily strength: More than we wished we knew the blessing then Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals Were frugal, Sabine fare—and then, exclude A little weekly stipend, and we lived Through three divisions of the quartered year In pennyless poverty. But now, to school Returned from the half-yearly holidays, We came with purses more profusely filled, Allowance which abundantly sufficed To gratify the palate with repasts More costly than the dame of whom I spake, That ancient woman, and her board, supplied. Hence inroads into distant vales, and long Excursions far away among the hills, Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground— Or in the woods, or by a river-side Or fountain—festive banquets, that provoked The languid action of a natural scene By pleasure of corporeal appetite. Nor is my aim neglected if I tell How twice in the long length of those half-years We from our funds perhaps with bolder hand Drew largely, anxious for one day at least To feel the motion of the galloping steed; And with the good old inkeeper, in truth I needs must say, that sometimes we have used Sly subterfuge, for the intended bound Of the day's journey was too distant far For any cautious man: a structure famed Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique walls Of a large abbey, with its fractured arch, Belfry, and images, and living trees— A holy scene. Along the smooth green turf Our horses grazed. In more than inland peace, Left by the winds that overpass the vale, In that sequestered ruin trees and towers— Both silent and both motionless alike— Hear all day long the murmuring sea that beats Incessantly upon a craggy shore. Our steeds remounted, and the summons given, With whip and spur we by the chantry flew In uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight And the stone abbot, and that single wren Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave Of the old church that, though from recent showers The earth was comfortless, and, touched by faint Internal breezes, from the roofless walls The shuddering ivy dripped large drops, yet still So sweetly mid the gloom the invisible bird Sang to itself that there I could have made My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there, To hear such music. Through the walls we flew And down the valley, and, a circuit made In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth We scampered homeward. O, ye rocks and streams, And that still spirit of the evening air, Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt Your presence, when, with slackened step, we breathed Along the sides of the steep hills, or when, Lightened by gleams of moonlight from the sea, We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand. There was a row of ancient trees, since fallen, That on the margin of a jutting land Stood near the lake of Coniston, and made, With its long boughs above the water stretched, A gloom through which a boat might sail along As in a cloister. An old hall was near, Grotesque and beautiful, its gavel-end And huge round chimneys to the top o'ergrown With fields of ivy. Thither we repaired— 'Twas even a custom with us—to the shore, And to that cool piazza. They who dwelt In the neglected mansion-house supplied Fresh butter, tea-kettle and earthernware, And chafing-dish with smoking coals; and so Beneath the trees we sate in our small boat, And in the covert eat our delicate meal Upon the calm smooth lake. It was a joy Worthy the heart of one who is full grown To rest beneath those horizontal boughs And mark the radiance of the setting sun, Himself unseen, reposing on the top Of the high eastern hills. And there I said, That beauteous sight before me, there I said (Then first beginning in my thoughts to mark That sense of dim similitude which links Our moral feelings with external forms) That in whatever region I should close My mortal life I would remember you, Fair scenes—that dying I would think on you, My soul would send a longing look to you, Even as that setting sun, while all the vale Could nowhere catch one faint memorial gleam, Yet with the last remains of his last light Still lingered, and a farewell lustre threw On the dear mountain-tops where first he rose. 'Twas then my fourteenth summer, and these words Were uttered in a casual access Of sentiment, a momentary trance That far outran the habit of my mind. Upon the eastern shore of Windermere Above the crescent of a pleasant bay There was an inn, no homely-featured shed, Brother of the surrounding cottages, But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset With chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within Decanters, glasses and the blood-red wine. In ancient times, or ere the hall was built On the large island, had the dwelling been More worthy of a poet's love, a hut Proud of its one bright fire and sycamore shade; But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed The threshold, and large golden characters On the blue-frosted signboard had usurped The place of the old lion, in contempt And mockery of the rustic painter's hand, Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay Upon a slope surmounted by the plain Of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood A grove, with gleams of water through the trees And over the tree-tops—nor did we want Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream— And there through half an afternoon we played On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent Made all the mountains ring. But ere the fall Of night, when in our pinnace we returned Over the dusky lake, and to the beach Of some small island steered our course, with one, The minstrel of our troop, and left him there, And rowed off gently, while he blew his flute Alone upon the rock, oh, then the calm And dead still water lay upon my mind Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky, Never before so beautiful, sank down Into my heart and held me like a dream. Thus day by day my sympathies increased, And thus the common range of visible things Grew dear to me. Already I began To love the sun—a boy I loved the sun Not as I since have loved him (as a pledge And surety of my earthly life, a light Which while I view I feel I am alive), But for this cause, that I had seen him lay His beauty on the morning hills, had seen The western mountain touch his setting orb In many a thoughtless hour, when from excess Of happiness my blood appeared to flow With its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy. And from like feelings, humble though intense, To patriotic and domestic love Analogous, the moon to me was dear: For I would dream away my purposes Standing to look upon her, while she hung Midway between the hills as if she knew No other region but belonged to thee, Yea appertained by a peculiar right To thee and thy grey huts, my native vale. Those incidental charms which first attached My heart to rural objects, day by day Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell How Nature, intervenient till this time And secondary, now at length was sought For her own sake. But who shall parcel out His intellect by geometric rules Split like a province into round and square? Who knows the individual hour in which His habits were first sown even as a seed? Who that shall point as with a wand, and say ‘This portion of the river of my mind Came from yon fountain’? Thou, my friend, art one More deeply read in thy own thoughts, no slave Of that false secondary power by which In weakness we create distinctions, then Believe our puny boundaries are things Which we perceive, and not which we have made. To thee, unblinded by these outward shews, The unity of all has been revealed; And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skilled Than many are to class the cabinet Of their sensations, and in voluble phrase Run through the history and birth of each As of a single independent thing. Hard task to analyse a soul, in which Not only general habits and desires, But each most obvious and particular thought— Not in a mystical and idle sense, But in the words of reason deeply weighed— Hath no beginning. Blessed the infant babe— For with my best conjectures I would trace The progress of our being—blest the babe Nursed in his mother's arms, the babe who sleeps Upon his mother's breast, who, when his soul Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul, Doth gather passion from his mother's eye. Such feelings pass into his torpid life Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind, Even in the first trial of its powers, Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine In one appearance all the elements And parts of the same object, else detached And loth to coalesce. Thus day by day, Subjected to the discipline of love, His organs and recipient faculties Are quickened, are more vigorous; his mind spreads, Tenacious of the forms which it receives. In one beloved presence—nay and more, In that most apprehensive habitude And those sensations which have been derived From this beloved presence—there exists A virtue which irradiates and exalts All objects through all intercourse of sense. No outcast he, bewildered and depressed; Along his infant veins are interfused The gravitation and the filial bond Of Nature that connect him with the world. Emphatically such a being lives, An inmate of this active universe. From Nature largely he receives, nor so Is satisfied, but largely gives again; For feeling has to him imparted strength, And—powerful in all sentiments of grief, Of exultation, fear and joy—his mind, Even as an agent of the one great mind, Creates, creator and receiver both, Working but in alliance with the works Which it beholds. Such, verily, is the first Poetic spirit of our human life— By uniform control of after years In most abated and suppressed, in some Through every change of growth or of decay Preeminent till death. From early days, Beginning not long after that first time In which, a babe, by intercourse of touch I held mute dialogues with my mother's heart, I have endeavoured to display the means Whereby this infant sensibility, Great birthright of our being, was in me Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path More difficult before me, and I fear That in its broken windings we shall need The chamois' sinews and the eagle's wing. For now a trouble came into my mind From obscure causes. I was left alone Seeking this visible world, nor knowing why. The props of my affections were removed, And yet the building stood, as if sustained By its own spirit. All that I beheld Was dear to me, and from this cause it came That now to Nature's finer influxes My mind lay open—to that more exact And intimate communion which our hearts Maintain with the minuter properties Of objects which already are beloved, And of those only. Many are the joys Of youth, but oh, what happiness to live When every hour brings palpable access Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight, And sorrow is not there. The seasons came, And every season brought a countless store Of modes and temporary qualities Which but for this most watchful power of love Had been neglected, left a register Of permanent relations else unknown. Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude More active even than ‘best society’, Society made sweet as solitude By silent inobtrusive sympathies, And gentle agitations of the mind From manifold distinctions—difference Perceived in things where to the common eye No difference is—and hence, from the same source, Sublimer joy. For I would walk alone In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights Beneath the quiet heavens, and at that time Would feel whate'er there is of power in sound To breathe an elevated mood, by form Or image unprofaned; and I would stand Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are The ghostly language of the ancient earth, Or make their dim abode in distant winds. Thence did I drink the visionary power. I deem not profitless these fleeting moods Of shadowy exaltation; not for this, That they are kindred to our purer mind And intellectual life, but that the soul— Remembering how she felt, but what she felt Remembering not—retains an obscure sense Of possible sublimity, to which With growing faculties she doth aspire, With faculties still growing, feeling still That whatsoever point they gain they still Have something to pursue. And not alone In grandeur and in tumult, but no less In tranquil scenes, that universal power And fitness in the latent qualities And essences of things, by which the mind Is moved with feelings of delight, to me Came strengthened with a superadded soul, A virtue not its own. My morning walks Were early: oft before the hours of school I travelled round our little lake, five miles Of pleasant wandering—happy time, more dear For this, that one was by my side, a friend Then passionately loved. With heart how full Will he peruse these lines, this page—perhaps A blank to other men—for many years Have since flowed in between us, and, our minds Both silent to each other, at this time We live as if those hours had never been Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush Was audible, among the hills I sate Alone upon some jutting eminence At the first hour of morning, when the vale Lay quiet in an utter solitude. How shall I trace the history, where seek The origin of what I then have felt? Oft in those moments such a holy calm Did overspread my soul that I forgot The agency of sight, and what I saw Appeared like something in myself, a dream, A prospect in my mind. 'Twere long to tell What spring and autumn, what the winter snows, And what the summer shade, what day and night, The evening and the morning, what my dreams And what my waking thoughts, supplied to nurse That spirit of religious love in which I walked with Nature. But let this at least Be not forgotten, that I still retained My first creative sensibility, That by the regular action of the world My soul was unsubdued. A plastic power Abode with me, a forming hand, at times Rebellious, acting in a devious mood, A local spirit of its own, at war With general tendency, but for the most Subservient strictly to the external things With which it communed. An auxiliar light Came from my mind, which on the setting sun Bestowed new splendour; the melodious birds, The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obeyed A like dominion, and the midnight storm Grew darker in the presence of my eye. Hence my obeisance, my devotion hence, And hence my transport. Nor should this, perchance, Pass unrecorded, that I still had loved The exercise and produce of a toil Than analytic industry to me More pleasing, and whose character I deem Is more poetic, as resembling more Creative agency—I mean to speak Of that interminable building reared By observation of affinities In objects where no brotherhood exists To common minds. My seventeenth year was come, And, whether from this habit rooted now So deeply in my mind, or from excess Of the great social principle of life Coercing all things into sympathy, To unorganic natures I transferred My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth Coming in revelation, I conversed With things that really are, I at this time Saw blessings spread around me like a sea. Thus did my days pass on, and now at length From Nature and her overflowing soul I had received so much that all my thoughts Were steeped in feeling. I was only then Contented when with bliss ineffable I felt the sentiment of being spread O'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still, O'er all that, lost beyond the reach of thought And human knowledge, to the human eye Invisible, yet liveth to the heart, O'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings, Or beats the gladsome air, o'er all that glides Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not If such my transports were, for in all things I saw one life, and felt that it was joy; One song they sang and it was audible— Most audible then when the fleshly ear, O'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain, Forgot its functions and slept undisturbed. If this be error, and another faith Find easier access to the pious mind, Yet were I grossly destitute of all Those human sentiments which make this earth So dear if I should fail with grateful voice To speak of you, ye mountains, and ye lakes And sounding cataracts, ye mists and winds That dwell among the hills where I was born. If in my youth I have been pure in heart, If, mingling with the world, I am content With my own modest pleasures, and have lived With God and Nature communing, removed From little enmities and low desires, The gift is yours; if in these times of fear, This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown, If, mid indifference and apathy And wicked exultation, when good men On every side fall off we know not how To selfishness, disguised in gentle names Of peace and quiet and domestic love— Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers On visionary minds—if, in this time Of dereliction and dismay, I yet Despair not of our nature, but retain A more than Roman confidence, a faith That fails not, in all sorrow my support, The blessing of my life, the gift is yours Ye mountains, thine O Nature. Thou hast fed My lofty speculations, and in thee For this uneasy heart of ours I find A never-failing principle of joy And purest passion. Thou, my friend, wast reared In the great city, mid far other scenes, But we by different roads at length have gained The self-same bourne. And from this cause to thee I speak unapprehensive of contempt, The insinuated scoff of coward tongues, And all that silent language which so oft In conversation betwixt man and man Blots from the human countenance all trace Of beauty and of love. For thou hast sought The truth in solitude, and thou art one The most intense of Nature's worshippers, In many things my brother, chiefly here In this my deep devotion. Fare thee well: Health and the quiet of a healthful mind Attend thee, seeking oft the haunts of men— But yet more often living with thyself, And for thyself—so haply shall thy days Be many, and a blessing to mankind.</field>
