Hunnis wisheth increase of vertue and honour, with long life, prosperous health, godlie feare, firme faith, and assured hope in the Almightie. The Author to his Booke. Passe foorth my booke into the hands and view of sundry men: Humble thy selfe, declare thy name who thee thus clad and when: And blush not at the frumps of some, ne feare at others frowne: More rich thou art in thred bare cote, then some in silken gowne. And giue them all to vnderstand, from whence thou first didst spring, How thou wast fostred in the brest and bosome of a king. And so (perhaps) some woorthie wight wil shape thee rich arraie, And set thee foorth as thou deseru'st with costly iewels gaie. Behaue thy selfe in such good sort, if possible maybe, That euery one may thee embrace, and wish wel vnto me. Vale. The Booke to his Readers Good friends with fauor me peruse, halfe naked though Ibee, Or not attierd so gallantlie, as you desire to see. Yet this from me your selues assure, such substance here to find, As shall bring hope vnto the hart, and comfort to the mind. Oft vnder short and simple weed, such vertue may be found, As vnder pall of purple hew that traileth on the ground. I being good am not the worse, though clothing mine be bad, He that bestowd the same on me, did giue the best he had. In whose behalfe I humbly pray, and for my selfe also, You would vouchsafe to mind those faults, that in my cote ye kno. Vale. Seuen Sobs of a Sorrowfull Soule for Sinne. Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him vpon the lute and harp. Let euerie thing that hath breth praise y? Lord Psalme 150, verse 3 and. 6. Domine ne in furore. Psal. 6. The first part. 1 O Lord when I my self behold, how wicked I haue bin; And view the paths and waies I went, wandring from sin to sin; 2 Againe, to thinke vpon thy power, thy iudgement, and thy might; And how that nothing can be hid, or close kept from thy sight; 3 Euen then (alas) I shake and quake, and tremble where I stand, For feare thou shouldst reuenged be, by power of wrathful hand. 4 The weight of sin is verie great, for this to mind I call, That one proud thought made angels thine from heauen to slide and fall. 5 Adam likewise, and Eue his wife, for breaking thy precept From paradice expelled were; and death thereby hath crept 6 Vpon them both, and on their seed, for euer to remaine: But that by faith in Christ thy sonne, we hope to liue againe. 7 The earth not able was to beare, but quicke did swallow in, Corah, Dathan, and Abiron, by reason of their sin, 8 Also because king Dauid did his people number all, Thou Lord therfore, in three daies space, such greeuous plague letst fall; 9 That seuentie thousand men forthwith thereof dide presentlie, Such was thy worke, such was thy wrath, thy mightie power to trie. 10 (Alas) my sin surmounteth theirs, mine cannot numbred bee, And from thy wrath most mightie God, I know not where to flee. 11 If into heauen I might ascend, where angels thine remaine, O Lord, thy wrath would thrust me forth downe to the earth againe. 12 And in the earth here is no place of refuge to be found, Nor in the deepe and water course, that passeth vnder ground. 13 Vouchsafe therefore I thee beseech, on me some mercie take, And turne thy wrath from me awaie, for Iesus Christes sake. 15 Lord in thy wrath reproue me not, ne chast me in thine ire, But with thy mercie shadow me, I humblie thee desire. 16 I know it is my greeuous sinne that do thy wrath prouoke, But yet ô Lord, in rigor thine forbeare thy heauy stroke. 16 And rather with thy mercie sweet, behold my heauy plight, How weake and feeble I appeare before thy blessed sight. 17 For nature mine corrupted is, and wounded with the dart Of lust and foule concupiscence, throughout in euery part. 18 I am in sinne conceaude and borne, the child of wrath and death, Hauing but here a little tune to liue and draw my breath. 19 I feele my selfe stil apt and prone to wickednesse and vice, And drowned thus in sinne I lie, and haue no power to rise. 20 It is thy mercy, ô sweet Christ, that must my health restore: For al my bones are troubled much, and vexed very sore 21 I am not able to withstand temptations such as be, Wherefore good lord vouchsafe to heale my great infirmitie. 22 Good Christ as thou to Peter didst, reach forth thy hand to me, When he vpon the water went, there drowned like to be. 23 And as the Leaper clensed was, by touching with thy hand. And Peters mother raised vp from feuer whole to stand: 24 So let that hand of mercy thine, make cleane the leprosie Of lothsome lust vpon me growne, through mine iniquitie. 25 Then shal there strength in me appeer through grace my cheefe releefe, Thy death, O Christ, the medicine is that helpeth all my greefe. 26 My soule is troubled verie sore, by reason of my sin: But Lord how long shall I abide thus sorrowfull therein? 27 I doubt not Lord, but thou which hast my stonie hart made soft, With willing mind thy grace to craue, from time to time so oft; 28 Wilt not now stay, but foorth proceed my perfect health to make, Although a while thou doost defer, yet is it for my sake. 29 For lord, thou knowst our nature such if we great things obtaine; And in the getting of the same do feele no griefe or paine; 30 We little doo esteeme thereof, but hardly brought to passe, A thousand times we do esteeme, much more than th'other was. 31 So Lord, if thou shouldst at the first grant my petition, The greatnes of offences mine, I should not thinke vpon. 32 Wherefore my hope still bids me crie with faithful heart in brest, As did the faithfull Cananite, whose daughter was possest. 33 At least if I still knock and cal vpon thy holy name, At length thou wilt heare my request and grant to me the same: 34 As did the man three loaues of bread vnto his neighbor lend; Whose knocking long forst him to rise and shew himselfe a friend. 35 Lord by the mouth of thy deere son, this promise didst thou make: That if we knocke thou open wilt the doore euen for his sake. 36 Wherefore we crie, we knock, we cal and neuer cease wil wee, Til thou doo turne to vs, ô Lord, that we may turne to thee. The second part. [1] Tvrne from thy wrath, ô Lord of hosts, and set my hart at large: Oh saue me for thy mercies sake, and all my sins discharge. 2 Not for the merits I haue doon ne for the works I wrought, But for thy endlesse mercie sake, and bloud which hath vs bought. 3 The debt is great that I am in, not able for to paie, And how to recompense the same, none other can I saie; 4 But goodesse thine must me acquite, or else (alas) must I To prison, where no ransome may set me at libertie. 5 For why in death, ô God of life, no man remembreth thee, And in the hel who giues thee thanks was none yet knowne to bee 6 The greeuous plagues and tormentes there, so smarting be and strong, That no can haue mind on thee, or thee confesse among. 7 No time is there of space, ne place repentance for to find; But burning paines, and torments sharpe to al be there assind. 8 Remembring this while I am here, and do this life possesse, To thee, O Lord, in humble wise, I doo my faults confesse: 9 And with a spirit all sorrowful I do my sinnes lament, And sory am euen from my soule, I did such waies frequent. 10 And am with groning wearie made, through tast of many feares; The night I spend my bed to wash, my couch to wet with teares, 11 Not weeping to the sight of men, (as doth the hypocrite) But in thy chamber secretly, where I my sinnes recite. 12 Not onely with the teares of eies, but teares fet from alow, That is, from bottome of my hart, repentance great to show. 13 And as my bodie I haue made a seruant vnto sin; So wil I now by power of grace, delight no more therein: 14 But wil the same on thee bestow, ô Lord, and freely giue, To serue thee Lord in righteousnesse, the daies I haue to liue. 15 For in this bed of flesh and bloud, and couch of sensual life, The soules of all from Adams fal, haue laine in wo and strife. 16 And this doth make our countenance or mind to changed be, For inwarde greefe of this our couch of sensualitie. 17 For when we seeke therein to rest, and thinke some ease to find, It after turneth to our griefe, and anguish great of mind. 18 It is a serpent faire in face appearing to the sho; But in his taile a sting lies hid of endlesse paine and wo. 19 Mine eie, ô Lord, is troubled sore, with extreame rage and paine: And I among mine enemies doo weake and old remaine. 20 The wicked feend mine enimie, still seeketh to deuise Some matter of occasion, to laie before mine eies. 21 The world also doth draw me forth to follow her delight: My flesh to sensualitie runs on with maine and might. 22 The companie of wicked sort entise me daie by daie: Thus I with them, and they with me, (alas) stil run astraie. 23 These enemies I neuer can be able to subdue, It must be thou, O Iesu sweet, most mightie and most true: 24 Thou Lord which hast destroied deth the diuel likewise supprest, Must giue me power to ouercome, Whereby to liue in rest. 25 Then vnderneath thy death &amp; crosse I shal my sinnes displaie, And strongly fight against my foes, and boldlie to them saie, 26 Away from me that workers be of wickednes and sin: For why the Lord hath heard my voice, and seene my teares therein. 27 You damned spirits, and liuers lewd, the members of the feend, Away from me: for now your power is brought vnto an end. 28 Your prince and maister of this world that hath me turnd and tost, Is now cast out, and al his power, his might and strength is lost. 29 Althogh you haue me long time held in prison and in thrall; Yet are yee now cleane ouercome, by Christ most strong of al. 30 I that in darkenesse erst was led, doo now behold the light; The Lord my praier sure hath heard, my sute is in his sight. 31 To thee, O Lord, for grace I praid, and thou heardst my request; And sentst abundant dewes thereof vnto my quiest rest. 32 That I praid likewise, all my sins might cleane remitted be, And thou hast granted my desire, and safe deliuerd me. 33 Wherefore let all mine enemies confounded be with shame, And that right soone and suddenlie, O Lord I craue the same. 34 I know that all mine enemies shal vexed be right sore, And that thou wilt put them to flight, from henceforth euermore. 35 For what long time they haue possest they lost in little space, Through operation of thy power, and working of thy grace. 36 With wrong they kept which y? sweete Christ by bloud hast deerly bought, And thou a mightie Champion hast turnd their power to nought. 37 Lord, I therefore thy seruant poore most earnestlie do praie, To guide my feet and steps aright in thy most holie waie. 38 And that the feend mine enemie, who seekes me to deuoure, Maie neuer ouer my poore soule haue any strength or power: 39 But as by grace I am restord to fauor thine againe; So with that grace defend me Lord, from euerlasting paine, Amen. Beatiquorum. Psal. xxxij. The first part.Sing this as before. [1] O God, I know by grace, through faith the sinner is made iust, Though we offend; yet iustifide by grace through faith we trust 2 Which grace &amp; faith are thy good gifts, which thou hast giuen vs free, And thorough them the works we doo are made right good to be. 3 I therefore Lord my faults confesse, by helpe of heauenly grace, And vtterlie my sinnes forsake, and do them al deface: 4 Beseeching thee me to admit with those that blessed bee, And to forgiue the trespasses which I haue doone to thee. 5 For blessed is the man indeed, whose wickednesse and sin, Is cleane forgiuen and couered, as they had neuer bin. 6 I will not hide my sinnes from thee, nor seeke them to excuse; But with my heart will them confesse, and doo my selfe accuse. 7 For, Lord, who goes about to hide his own iniquitie; Thou shalt the same make manifest, that al the world may see; 8 Thou wilt him strip and naked make, to his perpetual blame, When he to iudgement shall arise, and liue in endlesse shame. 9 And therefore blessed is the man, to whom thou Lord shalt saie, I not impute thy sinnes to thee, nor to thy charge them laie, 10 He in whose spirit no fraud is found, shal blessed be also, And looke what thing he takes in hand, shall prosper wel and gro. 11 If I for sinne should faine my selfe all sorrowfull to be, And were not so, then should be found both fraud and guile in me. 12 Or if I should account my selfe a man that liueth iust, Hauing my conscience stuft with sinne, so full as may be thrust: 13 There shuld appeer great fraud in me for deepe dissembling so; Nor why, in me no goodnesse dwels, as of my selfe I kno. 14 If euer any good were there, it surely must be thine, Yet as for sinnes I many haue, and they by right are mine. 15 For while, ô Lord, I held my peace, confessing not my crime, My bones did waft through daily plaints, I made from time to time. 16 My soule doth feeble waxe and faint, because I held my peace; But now I haue my sinnes confest, I feele hir strength increase. 17 I kept that backe I should haue told, or else excus'd the same; And that I should haue closelie kept, did publish to my blame. 18 I hid the sinnes that I haue done, and they remained still, And boasted forth the good I did, contrarie to thy will. 19 Thus were the works y? I had wrought quite lost with their reward, And I among that sort remaine whom thou doost not regard. 20 For daie and night thy heauy hand, vpon me thou hast laid, And in my trouble was I turnd, when I was sore afraid. 21 My tribulation scourged me, my moisture is made drie, My verie backe bone striken was, that I began to crie. 22 My conscience likewise striken was, with pricke of great remorse, And conscience mine vnquiet was, till grace the same did force, 23 And make me knowledge al my faults that I had done to thee; Thus hath thy grace made me confesse, all mine iniquitie. The second part. [1] Lord when against my selfe I spake, shewing what I had bin, Thou Lord, forthwith didst cleane remie my wickednesse and sin. 2 So soone as I determind was, no longer them to hide, Thou Lord straight way forgauest me, my faith the same hath tride, 3 And yer my voice was in my mouth, thine eare was in my heart; Thus hath thy mercie clensed me throughout in euery part. 4 Thou art more ready to forgiue, than we are to confesse, So that we do our selues accuse, and shew our guiltinesse. 5 Some blame the diuel as cause of sin, some destinie do blame, Some other saie complexion theirs cannot auoid the same; 6 But, Lord, I leaue such vaine excuse, and with the prophet saie, Its I O Lord that do offend, its I, I not denaie; 7 Its I my selfe that wrought this wo, through mine iniquitie, Its I O Lord, and not the deuil, nor yet my destiny: 8 Yet by thy sufferance, Lord, they may onelie entise a man; But to inforce or him compell, that do they neuer can. 9 Wherefore good Lord, my sickly soule to health againe restore. For this ought all thy holy ones to praie in time therefore. 10 This is the time in which thou wilt, giue eare when we do cal; For after this no time there is thou wilt vs heare at all. 11 This is the time, Lord thee to seeke, while that thou maist be found, This is the time thou wilt vs heare, and keepe vs safe and sound 12 From rage of many waterflouds, that with temptations flo; And from the proud and wicked sort, with manie troubles mo. 13 These shal no time approch to vs, to do vs any harme; For why thy grace shal beat them backe by strength of mighty arme. 14 Although amid this water floud of surging waues of sin, We tossed be among the rocks, yet are not drownd therein. 15 For thou, ô Lord, art my refuge from troubles al that be, And though temptations of the world about haue compast me; 16 I not regard inticements theirs, nor threats that they shal make For why my faith assureth me that thou my part wilt take. 17 Thou Lord art only my defense, my ioy is al in thee, Thou shalt me compasse round about, and safe deliuer me. 18 The tabernacle of my soule is round about me set With enemies, such as do seeke mine hinderance and let. 19 But yet O Lord thy prouidence shal me deliuer stil, And from al dangers me defend, after thy holy wil. 20 Thou wilt informe and shew to me the way that I shal go: This life is but a pilgrimage I passe in to and fro. 21 Of this way Lord, thou art the end, and marke whereat I shoot; Grant that I may this voiage passe, and foes of mine confute; 22 And in the running of my course, my faith so strong may be, That I may haue one of those games of immortalitie. 23 Thus shal thine eie of strong defence on me be fixed sure, And I with ioie shal able be this trauel to indure. 24 For Lord if thou shouldst turne thy face or cast thine eie aside, I should not able be to run, nor labor this abide. 25 But should be as the horse and mule that vnderstanding want: Such of thy grace, faith, and good works, Both barren be and scant. 26 They are too proud and scornfull eke, thy lawes to hold and keepe, The lusts and pleasures of the flesh so lulleth them asleepe, 27 But yet the mouthes of such wild beasts. thou Lord with bit and brake Shalt snaffle them with chaine and curbe, that do thee so forsake. 28 For great and many are the plagues of those that sinners be, By meanes whereof a number, Lord, are turned vnto thee. 29 And thou, O lord, that didst th? plage for their correction, Wilt also giue them comfort great, and consolation. 30 And he that trusteth in the Lord, he shall be compast in With mercie and remission of all his former sin. 31 Be glad therefore ye righteous, and in the Lord reioise: For he by grace hath made you iust, through his most louing choise: 32 Which were before stifnecked, proud, now gentle meeke and mild; Not by your merits, but by grace, as father to his child. 33 Al ye that be vpright of heart, in God reioice also; And to his will submit your will, in anguish, paine, and wo, 34 And as S. Paule th'Apostle was made great in his distresse, So Lord in all extremitie grant me the like successe, Amen. Domine ne in furore. Psal. 38. The first part. 1 Within my soule, ô Lord, doe manie troubles spring, Sometime by feare of punishment, that temprall things may bring: 2 Which happen may to me while I this life abide, For mine offenses done to thee, which cannot passe vnspide: 3 Sometime, ô Lord, by feare of sicknes and disease, Which here we suffer for his guilt, that first did thee displease. 4 Sometime againe by feare of death that follow must, Which in a time vnlooked for shall al consume to dust: 5 And last by feare, ô Lord, of euerlasting paine, Which I by sin haue well deserud, therein for to remaine. 6 But yet, ô blessed Lord, when thou shalt angrie be, Infurie thine correct me not, nor poure thy wrath on me. 7 And though thy bow be bent, with arrow set therein, And ready thou my soule to wound, for my committed sin: 8 Yet let thy mercie moue with ruth on me I craue; Because thou knowest I cannot giue the thing that I not haue. 9 For thou must first me giue, Yer I can giue to thee; For of my selfe and from my selfe, comes but iniquitie. 10 Thine arrowes I confesse, so deepe haue pearst my heart, That medcine none, ne other craft, can seuer them apart. 11 For if by craft I might these wounds make whole againe, And so escape eternal death, and euerlasting paine; 12 My feare should be the lesse, my ioy a great deale more: But thou, ô Lord, the leach must be, for sicknesse mine and sore. 13 Thine hands thou hast inforst so heauy vpon me, As death with dart I know right well, cannot auoided be. 14 O death, vnto the man that substance hath at wil, How sharpe and bitter is thy dart, when thou comst him to kill? 15 Lord in my flesh I feele, no health there is at all: For when I thinke most sure to stand, I rediest am to fall. 16 But blessed are those men, which neuer did offend In sinfull lusts; but haue themselues kept cleane vnto the end. 17 For in their soules they find great quietnesse and rest, And euery thing they take in hand, doth turne vnto the best. 18 But contrarie to those, that spend the daie and night, In exercise of wickednesse, and take therein delight. 19 For they in conscience feele such busines, broile, and strife, That for to thinke vpon their sin, a hel is to their life. 20 O Lord, among those sort, my selfe haue gone astraie, And from the face of anger thine, could neuer flee awaie. 21 Yet thou hast suffered me, and giuen me grace at last, For to acknowledge al my faults, and wicked life now past. 22 My bones were void of rest, by reason of my sin: And all my bodie greeued was, without and eke within. 23 Sinne may wel be comparde vnto a serpent vile, Which with his bodie, head, and taile, doth manie one begile, 24 For where the serpents head, to enter doth begin There al the bodie with the taile, apace comes sliding in. 25 The motion first to sinne, vnto the head applie, And when the heart consents thereto, then is the bodie nie. 26 The fact once being done, then is the serpents taile With head and bodie entred in, where he must needs preuaile. 27 For why this serpent sinne so high himselfe doth reare, Aboue mine head, the weight of whom is more then I can beare. 28 And this by sufferance came, by licence that I gaue, This serpents head into my soule his entrance first to haue, 29 For now hath he brought in his bodie, taile, and al; And therwith doth surcharge my soule that she is like to fal. 30 The burthen is so great, that many times (alas) She is compeld to do the thing she would not bring to passe. 31 Too hard it is for me this serpent to expel, It must be thou ô mightie king, the strength of Israel. 32 Thou that the diuels drauest forth out of the men possest, Vouchsafe this serpent to expel, and set my soule at rest. 33 Thy grace must worke in me to be contrite in hart, And this from thee, to me must come, withouten my desart. 34 My bones corrupted are, and putriside so sore, By reason of my follies past, that wo is me therefore. 35 The marks of mine old sins, doo rotten waxe againe, And fresh and greene they doo appeare, to further more my paine. 36 By reason of my sinne, I am a wretch become, Setting my mind on earthly things, like beast both brute and dum. 37 And crooked am I made, vnto the very end; The daie throughout continuallie with wo and greefe I spend. 38 Because I am throwne down, and not compeld thereto; No violence did me inforce thus wickedly to doo. 39 It was my will, which led intelligence awry. And that which reason willed me, the same did I denie, 40 Will is the middle part, Lord of my soule I know: And I my will for to exalt did reason ouerthrow 41 Wherby my loines are ful, that is, my flesh to saie, Repleat is with illusions, that me deceiue alwaie. 42 Ah wicked flesh of mine, that doth my soule intise; Thou hurtst thy selfe, offendst my God, by thy lewd exercise. 43 And by this lust of mine, no health is in my flesh, For sin my soule and body greeues still day by daie afresh. 44 My soule tormented is, by sight of mind vncleane; My bodie weake and feeble brought, through lust made bare and leane, 45 Thus I afflicted sore, and weary low am brought, And am a bondman vnto sinne, in word, in deede, and thought. 46 This sinne so setled is, that it will not depart, Which causeth me To rore and crie with sorrow from my hart, 47 O Lord the great desire, that doth proceed from me, And mourning much that I do make, not hidden is from thee. 48 Thy sight is of great strength, for end thereof is none, And be the distance nere so far, thy power and strength is one. 49 Thy sight, O God, attains to distant al that bee, And makes no change of more or lesse, as is with vs we see. 50 My heart is troubled sore, my strength is gone me fro; Likewise the sight of both mine eies, from me is gone also. 51 The tribulations great, wherewith my sinful hart Is vext, and troubled night and daie, about in euerie part. 52 Is, Lord, forfeare of thee, and of thy punishment, Which thou shalt render vnto me, for this my life mispent. 53 O Lord, remooue from me, this cloudie mist of mine, And with thy grace and mercy mixt annoint my dusked cine; 54 That I the way may see, wherein thou hast delight, And in the same my steps direct, to walke both daie and night, Amen The second part. [1] My wretchednes, O Lord, is more then may be said, Its not alone the greefe of hart, that maketh me dismaid. 2 Ne feeblenes of strength, deprest with vices all, Nor in the blindnesse of my soule, which readie is to fall, 3 But otherwise it coms. and stil increaseth more, That is, where I thought comfort find, is turned to my sore. 4 My friends and neighbours Lord, in whom I put my trust, Against me altogither stood, and shewd themselues vniust, 5 And they that stood me next, far off got them away; And such as waited for my life, set on me as a praie. 6 The force of wicked feends, O Lord, is verie strong: No earthly power is like to theirs, if thou them suffer long 7 To exercise their force, on sinners al that bee, Not one among ten thousand shal be left aliue to thee. 8 They study to deceiue, by wordly pleasures vaine, And ioies such as the flesh desires, to bring vs endlesse paine. 9 These Lord haue sought for me, and wrought me ill the while, And with deceitfull vanities, did daily me beguile. 10 Lord many times I feele, when I thus tempted am, Such pleasures spring, I ioy thereat, not looking whence they came. 11 Or at the least, O Lord, I would not vnderstand, Ne see the snares for me were laid, to bring me vnderhand. 12 The pleasures of the flesh so sweet sounds in mine eare, That what is spoken there against, I list not for to heare. 13 But as one being deafe, with silence passe away, And as a man that dumbe is borne, haue not a word to say. 14 Indeed I must confesse my selfe I haue not sought, Nor spake against my wickednesse in such sort as I ought. 15 But as one deafe and dumbe, that sin no time would blame, Ye open would mine eares to heare, how to auoid the same. 16 Yet true it is, O Lord, let man his faults confesse, With sighs and sorrow from his hart, he did thy lawes transgresse. 17 Yea let him do his best, and satisfaction make; And yet if he be void of hope, thou wilt him sure forsake. 18 For Iudas sorrow made, when he had thee betraid, And did restore the siluer backe, and downe againe it laid. 19 He openly confest, he sinned greeuouslie, In that he had falslie betraid the innocent to die; 20 And wanting hope, we see, into despaire he fel, And hangd himselfe vpon a tree, among the rauens to dwel. 21 Hope is the gift, O Lord, that from thy grace proceeds, And grace brings faith, and faith brings loue from which brings fruitfull deeds. 22 And for because that I did alwaies hope in thee, Thou wilt me heare, ô Lord my God, and safe deliuer me. 23 My hope is firmely fixt, and cannot be remooude; Because thy grace assureth me, my faith is not reprooude. 24 Thus haue I said, ô Lord, least any time at all, Mine enemies should ouer me triumph to see me fall. 25 For whiles my feet did slide, against me much they spake; That is to saie, whiles my desires, the waie to sinne did take, 26 And were from thee remooude to follow lothsome lust; Then did mine enemies reioice, to see me in the dust. 27 But Lord, I me submit, vnto thy discipline, And meekely take correction thine, for old offenses mine. 28 And haue my selfe prepard vnto the whip of paine, Whereby my griefe and dolour may stil in my sight remaine. 29 And Lord thou knowest of old, there is no good in me; Not one man good vpon the earth, not one seeke after thee. 30 Among thy chosen sort, vnfaithfulnes was found, Likewise among thy angels bright were thousands cast to ground: 31 Then how much more, alas, of wretches such as I, That dwel in houses made of clay, must sinne continuallie? 32 I will confesse to thee all mine vngodlinesse, And for my sinnes wil take more thought than any can expresse. 33 And yet O Lord thy grace must worke this good in me; By which I stedfast lie beleeue I chosen am of thee. 34 For now by grace I mind my sinfull life t'amend, And vnto vertue will applie my selfe vnto the end. 35 I see the follies past, wherein I tooke delight, To be both vile, wicked and nought, and odious in thy sight. 36 And though my foes do liue, and ouer me made strong, And they which hated me are great and do me treble wrong: 37 No maruel it's, O Lord, for why they mighty be, And are except thy grace assist, too strong alwaies for me. 38 They haue long time deuisd deceitful crafty gins, And by the same haue ouerthrowne the strongest in their sins. 39 If any time I flee repentance for to find, Then one of these malicious spirits assaileth straight my mind; 40 And with deuises new, and frauds that be vnknowne He craftilie doth me subdue, and so makes me his owne. 41 Thus Lord when I am bent, thy goodnesse to pursue, Mine enemies do me detract, and breed my bale anew. 42 The wicked feend (alas) doth many times me greeue; The world also doth follow me the daies I haue to liue. 43 The flesh doth me prouoke with lust both lewd and nought: Thus by these three mine enemies I am in thraldome brought. 44 Yet, Lord, forsake me not, ne let thy grace depart; Least that mine enemies vnwares do thorough pearse mine hart. 45 And though sometime, O Lord, thy presence thou withdraw, Whereby the feend may entrance make and bring me more in aw. 46 Yet Lord, thy grace restore to me poore wretch againe, That I thereby may him resist, to make his trauel vaine. 47 Giue heed therefore my God, which art my helpe and health, Whose mercy and whose goodnes shewd is to my soule cheefe wealth, 48 Giue temporal health, O Lord, as vnto thee seemes best, And to my soule thy sauing health, in heauen with thee may rest, Amen. Miserere mei. Psal. 51. The first part. 1 O thou that mad'st the world of nought, whom God thy creatures call, Which formedst man like to thy selfe, yet suffredst him to fall: 2 Thou God, which by thy heauenlie word, didst flesh of virgine take, And so becam'st both God &amp; man, for sinfull fleshes sake: 3 O thou that sawst when man by sin to hel was ouerthrowne, Didst meekely suffer death on crosse, to haue thy mercie knowne: 4 Thou God which didst the patriarks and fathers old diuine, From time to time preserue and keepe, by mercie great of thine. 5 O thou that Noah keptst from floud, and Abraham day by day, As he along through Aegypt past, didst guide him in the way. 6 Thou God that Lot fr? Sodoms plague didst safely keepe also, And Daniel from the Lions iawes, thy mercie great to sho, 7 O thou good God that didst diuide the sea like hils to stand, That children thine might thorow pas, from cruel Pharos hand; 8 So that when Pharo and his host, thy children did pursue, Thou ouerthrewst them in the sea, to proue thy saying true: 9 O thou that Ionas in the fish, three daies didst keepe from paine, Which was a figure of thy death, and rising vp againe. 10 I saie, thou God, which didst preserue amidst the fierie flame, The three young men, which sang therin the glory of thy name: 11 Thou God haue mercie on my soule, thy goodnesse me restore: And for thy mercies infinit, thinke on my sinne no more. 12 O Lord the number of my sins is more then can be told, Wherefore I humblie doo desire thy mercies manifold. 13 For small offence thy mercie smal, may soone small faults suffice, But I, alas, for many faults for greater mercie cries. 14 And though the number of my sinnes surpasse the salt sea sand, And that the filth of them deserue the wrath of thy iust hand: 15 Yet do thy mercies far surmount the sins of al in al, Thou wilt with mercie vs releeue, for mercie when we cal. 16 Right wel I know, man hath no power so much for to transgresse, As thou with mercie maist forgiue through thine almightinesse. 17 I do confesse my faults be more than thousand else beside, More noisome and more odious, more fouler to be tride, 18 Than euer was the lothsome swine, or menstruall cloth beraid: To thinke thereon my woful soule, (alas) is yet afraid. 19 Wherfore good Lord, doo not behold how wicked I haue bin, But wash me from my wickednesse, and clense me from my sin. 20 The Israelits being defil'd durst not approch thee nie, Till they their garments and themselues had washed decentlie. 21 The priests eke clensed also were, yer they thy face would see, Else had they perisht in their sin; such, Lord, was thy decree. 22 Alas how much more neede I then; to craue while I am here, To wash my soule and spotted soule that it may cleane appeere? 23 Polluted cloths with filth distaind doo many washings craue, Yer that the launder can obtaine the thing that he would haue. 24 My soule likewise (alas) doth need thy many dewes of grace, Yer it be cleane, for cankred sin so deepe hath taken place. 25 The leprosie that Naman had, could not be doon away, Till he seuen times in Iordan floud had washt him daie by daie. 26 How manie waters need I then for to be washed in, Yer I be purged faire and cleane, and clensed from my sin? 27 But, Lord, thy mercie is the sope and washing lee also, That shal both scoure &amp; cleanse the filth which in my soule doth gro. 28 Why should I then (alas) despaire of goodnes thine to mee, When that thy iustice willeth me to put my trust in thee? 29 Thy promise Lord thy mouth hath past which cannot be but true, That thou wilt mercie haue on them, that turne to thee anew. 30 I know when heauen and earth shall passe this promise shall stand fast: Wherefore vnto thy maiestie, I offer now at last 31 An heart contrite and sorrowfull, with all humilitie; For heinous sin by it conceiu'd through mine iniquitie; 32 I do acknowledge all my faults, my sinnes stand me before; I haue them in remembrance, Lord, and will for euermore. 33 Bicause thou shouldst the same forget I still doo thinke thereon, And set it vp before my face, alwaies to looke vpon. 34 Against thee only haue I find and doon ill in thy sight; In whom it lies to punish me, or to forgiue me quight. 35 But sure my hope is firmely fixt, that thou wilt me forgiue; For with thine honor shal it stand, to suffer me to liue: 36 That al the world may witnesse thee a iudge most iust to bee, For that thou wilt thy promise keepe, to al that trust in thee. 37 That is, our sins thou wilt remit, and cleane forget them al, And bend thine eares vnto our plaints, when we vpon thee cal. The second part. 1 O Lord consider with thy selfe, what mettall I possesse, Behold in sinne I was conceiude, and borne in wickednesse. 2 From Adam first this sinne was drawn whereby I am made prone To do the ill should thee offend, and let the good alone. 3 Yea, many a time I am so drawne to doo I would not do, And that I would I leaue vndone, for want of might thereto, 4 Such is, O Lord, the strength and force of my concupiscence: But yet of greater force than this, is, Lord, thine indulgence. 5 For thou wilt mercie shew to them, that mercie do require; And wilt not turne thy face from such as mercie do desire, 6 Surely of honour more is thine, through pitie men to saue; Than by thy iustice to condemne such as deserued haue. 7 Therefore, O Lord, receiue me now; which do my selfe accuse; To th'end thou shouldst my sins forgiue, and al my faults excuse. 8 O Lord, I do not hide my sinnes, but shew them vnto thee; Because thou shouldst thy mercie grant, as thou hast promisd me. 9 For neuer yet thou hast beene found in anie word vniust, Ne canst thou now begin at me, since that in thee I trust. 10 Thou Lord hast euer loued truth, and truth thou art most sure, Thou art the verie veritie for euer to indure. 11 Thou promisedst to Abraham, his seed to multiplie, Euen as the star, and as the sand that in the sea doth lie. 12 To Ishac and to Iacob eke, like promise didst thou make; And thou the same performed hast, for this thy promise sake. 13 Thou promisedst to Iosue, to strength him with thine hand, And so he slue the Chananites, and did diuide their land. 14 To Gedeon thou promise madst, that he should set at large The Isrelites, which were in thral, and in their enemies charge. 15 When Ezechias laie sore sicke, and wel nie at deaths dore, Thou promisdst him his health againe, to liue fifteene yeeres more. 16 Thus hast thou kept thy promises to thousands else beside, Who haue reposed trust in thee, thou hast not helpe denide. 17 Euen so good Lord thy promise keepe with me that am vniust, A scabbed sheepe, one of thy flocke, and ouerchargd with lust. 18 Which of long time haue run astraie the time since I was borne, Yet now returnd with heauy heart, that's with repentance torne. 19 Thus hath thy grace now called me, with mercie of thine hand; And what thy wil and pleasure is, by grace I vnderstand. 20 Thou hast reuealed vnto mee the things that be vnknowne, The secret points of wisedome thine thy grace to me hath showne. 21 Thy mysteries that hidden were within thy sacred word, Thou hast to vs made manifest, by Iesus Christ our Lord. 22 I am now fed with bread of life, that shal my hunger flake, And from dame wisdoms watry springs my drinke I often take. 23 Now wisdome hath cast out her floud the plants al watered be, And stil she seekes to lighten those, that put their trust in thee. 24 Of this her floud S. Paule did drinke, and he was taught thereby, Thy wisedome, Lord, which secret was, and hidden long did lie: 25 As thou to him didst manifest by thy free spirit before, Which searcheth out the verie depth of secrets thine and store. 26 Of this Lord part I tasted haue, through mercie shewd to me, And am now taught by them to know, mine owne infirmitie, 27 And by it am I taught likewise thy goodnesse for to kno, Beseeching thee this worke begun, maie neuer part me fro. 28 So that the light which kindled is in me by thy great grace, Maie so increase, as darknesse, Lord, maie neuer more take place. The third part. [1] With Hyssop, Lord be sprinkle me, and clense me from my sin, More whiter then shall I be made, than euer snow hath bin. 2 Thou didst command this herbe with blood a sprinkle for to bee, To sprinkle such as clensed were from lothsome leprosie: 3 A bundle of this herbe, ô Lord, thou didst command also To dip in bloud of simple sheepe, and therewithal to sho 4 Vpon the doore posts of the house, the slaigher might it see, Wherby the plague might shun the place and from thy people flee. 5 These vnto vs do represent the bloud of thy deere sonne, Without the which no man is cleane, what euer can be done. 6 And he that marks his soule therewith and puts his trust therein, The slaier hath no power to hurt, nor plague him for his sin. 7 If with this grace thou sprinkle me, I shal be white I know, And though as bloud my sins appeare, they shal be like the snow. 8 Yea though my sins as purple were, or as the scarlet die, Thy grace shall make them as the wooll t'appeare before thine eie. 9 Then shall I heare the words of ioy, of gladnesse so likewise, That Nathan to king Dauid spake, whom thou didst not despise. 10 That is, My sins are now put out, what euer I haue done, And are forgiuen me quight and cleane by Iesu Christ thy sonne, 11 Then shall I heare the wordes Christ spake to him the palsie had, My sonne thy sinnes are thee forgiuen, arise, go home, be glad. 12 Then shal I heare thee also speake by inspiration, Whereby I shal be comforted in tribulation. 13 Yea Lord, the bones thou broken hast shall then againe reioice, Through working of thy heauenly grace and sweetnesse of thy voice: 14 That is, the powers of my poore soule whom sin so weake hath brought, Whereby it wanted power to worke the good it long time sought, [15] Shall then recouer that was lost, and be reuiu'd againe, And through the quickening of thy spirit sin shal no more remaine. 16 Wherefore, thy face turne from my sins, and wipe my faults awaie, And eke al mine iniquitie; most humblie I thee praie: 17 I meane the face of iustice thine, wherewith thou doost behold The sinnes we dailie do commit, to punish manifold. 18 This face, good Lord, turne y? from me and from the faults I make, And them forget, and me forgiue, for thy great mercie sake. 19 But Lord, the face of mercie thine, from me turne not awaie: But therewithall behold me still, and helpe me daie by daie, 20 For what am I if that thy grace thou take awaie from me? A bondman vnder sin and death, and cast awaie of thee, 21 And euerie man thy grace that wants, shall haue a hart of stone, As Pharo had after thy grace departed was and gone. 22 He shall both see and heare indeed, yet shal be deafe and blind; His eares and eies shall stopped be, the truth he shal not find. 23 His heart likewise shal frozen be, or as the stonie wall; He shal thy creatures like and loue, and loue not thee at al: 24 Yea, such a heart, ô Lord in me, long time hath taken place, Which no waie can be mollifide but by thy special grace. 25 Wherefore I praie thee hartilie, remoue this hart from me; And, Lord, in me a new heart make, that flexible may be: 26 A fleshie hart, both soft and meeke, an heart that I may know Thou art the Lord, without whose grace no goodnesse I can show. 27 This grace it is that must reuiue, aright spirit, Lord, in me, My spirit through sinne is crooked made, and lothsome for to see. 28 Make it vpright therefore to be, and that decline it may From worldlie pleasures light and vaine, that vanish soone awaie. 29 Vouchsafe, ô Lord, to heauenly things my spirit may aspire, And with thy grace replenisht be, most humblie I desire. 30 Let neither yet aduersitie, nor worldly wealth also Plucke downe my spirit, nor hinder it, where it desires to go. 31 Ne cast me off at anie time, from presence of thy face; Ne take from me thy holy spirit, ô Lord in any case. 32 My sinnes good Lord, behind thee cast there euer to remaine: But cast not me from thy sweet face, as thou didst wicked Caine. 33 Nor from thy fauor cast me so, as thou didst cast king Sall, For if that I thy presence loose, I cannot choose but fall. 34 O Lord how sweet and gratious is this my spirit most pure; It leadeth those that loueth thee, where righteous folke endure. 35 Grant, Lord, that this thy holy spirit, may dwel within me stil, And me confirme in righteousnes, according to thy will. The fourth part. 1 O Lord my God restore to me thy sauing health againe, And stablish me with thy chiefe spirit, that it may still remaine. 2 My sins, ô Lord, haue beene the cause that I thy grace did want, And when thy grace departed was, I found thy spirit but scant: 3 The losse whereof did greeue me much and by the same I found Al goodnesse gone, al wickednes within me to abound. 4 For light and darknes may not be at one time in one place; No more may sin and wickednes associat be with grace. 5 Wherefore the greatnesse of my losse hath made my griefe the more, And where in sin I had delight, I now repent it sore. 6 Behold therefore most mightie God, mine inward griefe of mind, And of thy goodnesse me restore, to that I cannot find: 7 I meane thy sacred holie spirit, which I through weakenes lost, Mine enemies were strong and fierce, and cr?ellie me tost: 8 So that my soule too feeble was, their power for to withstand: Good Lord in grace yet once againe confirme me with thy hand. 9 And let thy spirit no more depart, no Lord not when I die, But that it may stil with my soule remaine continuallie. 10 Then shall I stedfastlie instruct the wicked in thy way, Whereby they may to thee returne, that long haue gone astraie. 11 I wil my selfe put forth, O Lord, to sinners al that be, As an example them to cause for to remember thee. 12 I wil not cease for to declare thy iustice euery where, And of thy iudgment bring them al in terror and in feare. 13 And then wil I againe extol thy mercies ouer al, To plucke them from despairing Lord, least any therein fal. 14 Thus shall I able be to do, being confirmd in thee, By working of thy holie spirit, which thou shalt put in me, 15 Thy seruant Moses was afraid, to go on message sent, Til thou promisd to be with him, when he to Pharo went. 16 After which time he doubted not, but forth went on his waie, Accomplishing thy holie hest, as thou didst bid him saie. 17 The seuentie elders of the host, to thee whom Moses brought, Til part of Moses spirit they had, were able to do nought: 18 But after that they propheside, and did thy people guide, And ruled them with righteousnesse and truth on euerie side. 19 Lord, Peter at a womens voice, thy sweet sonne Christ denaid, And readie was him to forsake, he was so sore afraid: 20 Vntil that thou reuiuedst him with this thy spirit of grace. Yea, Lord, thy sonnes apostles al, were bidden for a space, 21 To bide within Ierusalem, in praier and in loue; Til they were with thy holie sprite fulfilled from aboue. 22 Wherefore send down thy holie sprite, in me the same to be, And from the guiltinesse of bloud, good Lord deliuer me. The fift part. [1] Tthou God that God art of my health, deliuer me I praie, From sinne that I committed haue, against thee day by daie. 2 A multitude of sinnes there be, from flesh and bloud that grow, Which I through my concupiscence, haue dailie done I know. 3 And this corruption is in me by nature as I find, For what is he can make that cleane, that is vncleane by kind? 4 How can a man of woman borne, be cleane? I faine would kno, The child that is but one daie old, yet is vncleane also. 5 Thus flesh and bloud such works bring foorth as aie corrupted bee, And therefore cannot heauen inioy, ne dwell and raigne with thee. 6 Vpon corrupted nature mine, O Lord powre forth thy grace: And from these blouds deliuer me, and all my sinnes deface. 7 Then Lord shall I be purged cleane from all my wickednesse. Which grant good Lord, So shall my toong, exalt thy righteousnesse. 8 In that thou mercie shewst to me, being a wicked man, Giuing me grace pensiue to be, my grieuous sins to scan, 9 Making me iust that am vniust, wherein thou God art found In mercie, truth and righteousnesse, most perfect, sure and sound. 10 But yet, O Lord, before my toong, thy righteousnes can raise, My lips and mouth thou open must, whereby to shew thy praise. 11 For else vnseemely praise wil be, where lips be lickt with sin; And where the mouth with wickednesse is stuffed full within. 12 Good Lord the prophet Esay, when he thy glorie saw, Confest his lips to be vncleane, and therefore stood in awe; 13 Vntil such time as Seraphin thou sentst with burning cole His lips to touch, and therewithall he by and by was whole. 14 I meane that his vnrighteousnesse was then forgiuen quite, And al his sins and wickednesse was cleane put out of sight. 15 O Lord my God in such a sort vouchsafe my mouth to tuch, That I thy glory may set forth, to little and to much. 16 To offer sacrifice to thee, or offrings burnt were vaine, No pleasure Lord hast thou in them, nor ought in them remaine. 17 They were but figures of that thing, which now to passe is come, That is, the liuely sacrifice of Iesus Christ thy sonne. 18 To offer gold to thee, ô Lord, or treasure of the land, It needeth not, sith al the world is thine and at thy hand. 19 And yet I will not emptie come, but offer vnto thee An humble spirit with heart contrite for mine iniquitie. 20 This sacrifice, ô Lord, I know thou wilt no time despise; But it behold, and looke thereon with thy most gratious eies, 21 And Lord for y? there nothing should be left behind in me, Both bodie, soule, and al hir powers I offer vnto thee; 22 And as a liuely sacrifice, as Ezechias did, Such time as he thy fauor got, and health recouered. 23 The same did Marie Magdalen offer in humane sort: The theefe also vpon the crosse to his endles comfort. 24 Great numbers more vnspeakeable by this thy fauour wan; And I, through grace, now penitent, although a sinful man, 25 Do claime no lesse of mercie thine, for to be shewd to me: Bicause thou art as then thou wast and euermore shalt be. 26 To Sion, Lord, likewise shew forth thy fauor and thy grace, That is vnto thy faithful flocke disperst from place to place. 27 Such as depend on thee alone, and do themselues forsake, Vpon the walles of this thy fort, thou Lord, must vndertake 28 watchmen to set continuallie the same for to defend, Least that the enemies vnawares bring al to wofull end. 29 Thou knowst, ô Lord, of what small force mankind hath euer bin, Since first our father Adam fell, when he committed sinne. 30 Helpe vs therefore most mightie God, so with thy heauenlie grace, As we in building Sion here, by faith may see thy face: 31 So shall we then through mercie thine be squared stone meet found To building of Ierusalem, whose walles do still abound 32 With liuelie stones of thy true church here militant in earth; Where thine elect stil offer shal while thou shalt spare them breath. 33 Such offrings burnt as thou best lou'st which is of thanks and praise, We shal not spare the same to do, while life shal length our daies. 34 This sacrifice of iustice is, which all thy creatures craue, To giue the same onlie to thee, most worthie so to haue. 35 This is the bullocks of our lips, where of the prophet saies, We shal with lips vnto thy name confesse most condigne praise: 36 Which shall to thee accepted be, ten thousand times much more, Than were the bullocks great and fat, offred in time before. 37 Lord grant we may in number be of thine elected sort, Which shall this sacrifice present vnto our soules comfort: 38 And that as burning incense sweet thou wilt receiue the same, Vpon thine altar, which is Christ, our meane for sin and blame: Amen. Domine exaudi. Psal. 102. The first part.Sing this to the tune of y? 51. Psalm [1] O blessed and most mightie God, of grace the fountaine spring, Of mercie great and plentifull, most rich in euerie thing: 2 Thy blessed sonne in power with thee, is euen the same thou art, In wisedome, knowledge, and mercie alike in eurie part: 3 Thou didst not spare him down to send from heauenlie throne aboue, To suffer death mankind to saue; so ardent was thy loue. 4 Thou mad'st him poore was rich before to make vs rich thereby; For now is he made one with vs, through power of deitie. 5 Good Lord my praier hearken to, and let my dolefull crie Come vnto thee, and pearse the eares of thine high maiestie. 6 Shew forth, ô Lord, thy countenance of delectable shew, And with the eies of pitie thine, some fauour on me throw. 7 And in the daie of trouble mine thine eare bow downe to me And turne not thou thy face awaie, when I shal cal on thee: 8 But chieflie at the point of death, giue eare and me defend; And let thy grace procure and worke in me a ioyfull end 9 In whatsoeuer daie I call, ô Lord, with speed giue eare; And me deliuer from the greefes of troubles and of feare. 10 In speedie calling on thy name, O Lord, thou tak'st delite, And answer thine more readie is, than any may recite. 11 Wherefore in hast make speed, ô Lord in hearing when I praie, As I by need am driuen to craue thine aiding helpe and staie. 12 For why the time of life is short that I haue here to bide, And am vncertaine of the time when time from me shal slide. 13 At first thou Adam didst indue, when he created was, With life of immortalitie; but sin brought death (alas) 14 Which death from him is due to vs, that beareth life this daie, So that my daies like to the smoke consume and wast awaie. 25 Age ouertaketh youth I see, and youth by stealth doth flie, As doth the smoke vanish awaie aloft vnder the skie. 16 Yea many times it chanceth so, yer age come vs vpon, That death by stroke such wound dooth make that life with speed is gone. 17 Thus passeth foorth my time of life, more swifter I may say, Than is the ship good vnder saile, or Egle after praie. 18 My bones are waxen verie drie as is the firebrand, Or as the pot of claie, which doth in flaming fornace stand. 19 As bones of mine do wel sustaine the flesh the bodie keepes; So doth the power of soule susteine the soule that neuer sleepes: 20 Which being moistned with thy grace shal quicke and liuely bee, And able for to worke those works most pleasing vnto thee. 21 But if thy grace be stil withdrawne, then al shal drie remaine; Both bodie, soule, and al their powers, in euerlasting paine. 22 Full wel may men be likened to the grasse or withered haie, My heart is stricken with remorse because I went astraie. 23 So long as man by gift of grace doth liue and worke aright, So long is he greene flourishing, and liuely in thy sight: 24 But when that sinne makes entry in, which causeth man to fall, Then by and by he withereth, and barren is withall. 25 I haue forgot my bread to eat, that thou to me didst giue; Which is thy holy sacred word, by which my soule doth liue, 26 And I haue eaten of the fruit of the forbidden tree, And tasted haue of sinne and death, and brought thy wrath on mee. 27 Wherefore my leaues wither away, my fruit fals on the ground, And as a barren tree am left vnperfect and vnsound. 28 The feareful voice of sentence thine for mine offences donne, Doth cause me mourne, lament &amp; grone, my time yet for to ronne. 29 And with my voice of mourning mind, my bones haue cleaued hard Vnto my flesh, and sticke so fast, that nothing I regard. 30 Thus like vnto a pelican, I draw my selfe alone, And call to mind my greeuous crimes, and do the same bemone. 31 The pelican, as some report, hir harmlesse birds doth kill, And three daies after mourneth she, and is vnquiet still. 32 Then with her beake hir brest shee plucks, till bloud gush out amaine, Which she lets drop vpon hir yong, till they reuiue againe. 33 Thus, Lord, do I with my sweet birds, which are my works through grace, By sinne committed I them kill, and do them al deface: 34 But yet by praier for thy grace, which springs of grace indeed, The said dead works are quicke againe, my sickly soule to feed. 35 And Adam as a Pelican, touching some propertie; For through his sin he slue the birds came of his progenie. 36 And dead he had remained still, had not sweet Christ thy sonne Shed forth his bloud vs to reuiue, by mercie great was donne. 37 He kils and can raise vp to life, he strikes and heales againe, As in the persecution of Paule appeared plaine. 38 Shame causeth me for to withdraw my selfe to be alone: As doth the crowe that flies by night which would be seene of none. 39 And if I could, I would me hide, from thee as Adam did, Such time he tasted of the fruit that thou didst him forbid. 40 The works of darknesse loued I, and therefore did I flee From the most bright and shining sunne of iustice due to mee. 41 O Lord, for this cause do I sigh, stil sorrow, weepe, and waile, As one that ouerwatched is, whose rest and sleepe doth faile. 42 And as the sparrow do I watch that drawes her selfe alone, Vnder the euings of the house, hir fellowes want to mone. 43 And to augment my griefe withall, mine enemies al daie Do raile on me, and me reuiue; so spiteful as they may. 44 Againe, alas, My fained friends, that praised me before, Against me now conspire themselues, and vexe me verie sore. 45 Such false and fained flattring friends, much worse and harmefull be, Than those that openlie professe and shew their enmitie. 46 But both those sorts are sent to me, for plague vnto my sin, And for the great iniquitie that I haue wallowed in. The second part. [1] My bread with ashes do I eate; that is I right well kno, As I of earth and slime was made, to earth againe shall go. 2 Thus, in such bitter thoughts as these, I eat my bread withal, And minge my drinke with weeping teares, that from mine eies do fall. 3 Bicause thou angrie art with me for mine offenses past; O Lord, I know when time shal come, of iudgement daie at last: 4 Thy wrath and indignation shal then proceed from thee, And fall vpon the heads of those that worke iniquitie. 5 ô Lord thou hast me lifted vp, and throwne me to the ground, In that thou madst me like thy selfe, yer I was to be found, 6 No higher couldst thou lift me vp, than to beatitude; But then alas, thou letst me fall, whereby I this conclude: 7 My noble soule thou ioined hast with massie earth and claie, And bodie fraile, the weight whereof driues downe my mind alwaie. 8 And Lord, in my creation thou hast set me so hie, Aboue al other creatures that are vnder the skie. 9 And almost equal am I made with blessed angels thine, But in this state when I transgresse, damnation then is mine. 10 So that without thy mercies helpe I am in far worse plight Than any beast, whose life or soule with bodie dies outright. 11 My daies (alas) awaie doth passe, as shadow new begun; And I am withered like the grasse, changed by heat of sun. 12 Lord grant in shadow of this life, I may haue grace to see The light and knowledge of thy word, and waies prepard for mee: 13 Which word giues light vnto the babe yet sucking at the brest; For after that this life is past, repentance none doth rest. 14 And since the time, ô Lord, is short of mine abiding heere, Thy grace continue toward me, my guiltinesse to cleere, 15 For truly thine abiding is for euer to indure, And thy remembrance thorough out al generations sure. 16 But what is thy remembrance, through generations al? It is the diuine propertie, that vnto thee doth fall. 17 For to be meeke and merciful, which thou hast euer dun, From time to time, and age to age, since first the world begun. 18 And art more mindful of our state, and readier to forgiue, Than is the mother of her child late borne with her to liue. 19 Arise therefore and mercie shew, good Lord vpon Sion, Which is thy faithful people all, or congregation. 20 For time it is on hir to looke, and mercie thine extend, She hath long time great paine sustaind, whereof she craues an end. 21 What is this time, whereof we speake? was euer anie time, In which thou didst not mercie shew, to louing seruants thine? 22 No verelie. For from the time, the angels down did fall, Vntil the time the world shall end, thy mercie euer shal, 23 As it hath bin, from time to time, vpon al that repent; But chieflie was thy mercie shewd, when Christ was hither sent 24 To suffer death, to win vs life, thereby he enter might The glory of thy maiestie, aboue the angels bright. 25 This time was cald the time of grace, and was appointed when The fulnesse of the time was come, which was vnseene to men. 26 And yet before this time, to him was seene my Deitie, Whereby, ô Lord, al things thou doost in order with mercie. 27 This time of heauenlie grace we trust shall stil continue heare, To those in time that serueth thee, with penance, loue and feare, 28 The stones of Sion pleased wel thy seruant for thy truth, And they vpon the ground thereof shal pitie haue and ruth. 29 Apostles thine thy seruants were, the stones good christians bee; And thou the sure foundation of this faire worke to see. 30 Not vpon man nor angels bright did they this building laie, But vpon thee the corner stone, of al their worke the staie. 31 And as the heathen, Lord, shal feare and tremble at thy name, So Sion shal thy faithfull church, giue glorie to the same, 32 Because thou Lord, hast Sion built, thou wilt be seene therein, In glorie and great maiestie, with mercie for our sin. 33 Wherefore most louing father deere, regard our humble sute, And not despise the plaints we make, nor do our sinnes impute. 34 As thou beheldst the sacrifice that Abel gaue to thee, And as the praier Iudith made; so cast thine eie to me. 35 With those same eies vouchsafe to looke vpon vs when we praie, Whereby the fame of mercie thine may written be for aie. 36 For those that after vs shal come, by faith that borne shal be, To render thanks, giue laud, and praise vnto thy maiestie. 37 This mercie sure annexed is to nature thine diuine; When al was lost through deadly sin, yet didst thou make vs thine. 38 Thou Lord aloft from heauenly throne, didst view al things alow, And wouldst vouchsafe vpon the earth, thy gracious eine to throw; 39 To see and heare the plaints we make, that fettered be in thrall, And sent'st thy deare beloued Sonne from sinne to loose vs all. 40 And he thereby put downe the diuel of death that victor was, And death in victorie was consum'd; this hath he brought to passe. 41 For whie his sting of deadly sin, thou Lord hast pluckt awaie To make vs thinke of goodnes thine, wherein reioice we may; 42 And that in Sion we may shew, the glory of thy name, And likewise in Ierusalem with praise to do the same. 43 That is, when we together meet in faith with one accord, As well the king as subiects poore, to serue and praise the Lord. 44 Thou art, ô Lord, in substance one. and yet in persons three, To whom al powers in heauen and earth, obeisance giue to thee. 45 Thou sendest down thy dewes of grace vpon vs for to light, That we therewith good works may shew to euerie bodies sight. 46 I answere may, by no meanes else, good works be wrought by mee, But by the vertue and the grace, that doth proceed from thee. 47 Thorow thy might thy lawes we keepe not of our selues we know, But by the measure of thy grace, thou didst on vs bestow. 48 And yet, ô Lord, I faine would know, how short my daies shall be, And eke how long mine enemies shal triumph ouer me: 49 Which is, thy church desires to know how long she shall abide, Beset with cruel enemies about on euerie side. 50 To whom thou hast an answere made, by Christ thy blessed sonne, That still thy power with hir shal be, vntil the world be donne, 51 And we hir children thee desire to bring vs to the end Of this short time, that we with thee may to the heauens ascend. 52 And till that time good Lord vouchsafe thou wilt continue stil Thy grace and fauor toward vs, according to thy wil. 53 And not to leaue me any time, in middle of my daies, But by thine aid bring al my time to end vnto thy praise: 54 That after these my temporall daies, I may behold and see Thine euerlasting daies and yeeres, which cannot numbred bee. 55 For al times here do swiftlie passe, as time that is vnsure, But yet time of eternitie for euer shal indure. 56 For why, ô Lord, eternitie is verie substance thine; Which substance who so seekes to know, no reason can define. The third part. [1] Without beginning Lord thou wast, and yet beginning gaue To heauen and earth, and al therein, which that creation haue, 2 Thy hands them wrought, which is thy power, thy word them made also, And at the last, They perish shall, and motions theirs forgo. 3 Their substance stil they al shall keepe, yet al shal changed be, For heauen and earth shall now be made of glorie great to thee. 4 Likewise the bodies of al men, shal perish with the rest, And in another sort shall rise, to thee as seemeth best. 5 But thou Lord, truly shalt indure, in thy high glorie great, In maiestie omnipotent, sitting on mercie seat; 6 When all shal wax and weare awaie, as garments old to see, And as a vesture new out on, we al shall changed bee. 7 As garments to the bodie are, to couer them withall; So be the bodies of the soule, their vestures and their pall. 8 But thou art euen the selfe same one, which euer doost abide, That is to saie omnipotent, and so is none beside. 9 Inuisible thou art likewise, immortal eke withall, And as thy yeeres shal neuer faile, so euer bide they shall: 10 So shall the soules of thine elect immortallie remaine, In ioy and great felicitie, not knowing any paine. 11 The soules of those that wicked are immortall be also, But they contrarie shall endure continuall paine and wo. 12 And Lord, The sonnes of seruants thine, togither they shall dwell: Likewise their seed shall in thy sight stil prosper and do well. 13 Thy seruants, Lord, the prophets were apostles thine also, From whom by faith we haue receiu'd, as we beleeue and kno. 14 And now vouchsafe, most mighty God to send vs of thy grace, That in this life our faith by works may shine in euery place: 15 That they to all may signifie how we thy seruants bee, And that both soule and bodie may remaine and rest with thee. De profundis. Psal. 130. Sing this to the tune of y? 38. Psalm [1] O God thou art the guide of those that blinded bee, And vnto those that are opprest a succour sweet wee see. 2 A comfort to the weake, an ease to those in paine, A life vnto the dead in graue, that sleeping yet remaine. 3 O Lord, this makes me bold, though wicked I be found, And ouerwhelmed deepe in sin, and therein being dround, 4 To cal and crie to thee, from depth of miserie, Where none (but thou) can raise me vp, and safe deliuer mee, 5 I can but morne and weepe, fetch sighs, lament, and crie; As doth the woman great with child, whose hower draweth nie: 6 She no time can take rest, till she deliuered bee, Nor I, till that my conscience feele to be forgiuen of thee. 7 It is not distance long, that keeps my praier backe, Thou, Lord, doost heare before we call, and giuest what we lacke, 8 Ionas was in the sea, and in the fish three daies, And from the deepe he cald on thee, and straight thou didst him raise. 9 But from the deepe likewise, of sinne and wickednesse, To thee I cal; Lord heare my voice, and free me from distresse; 10 And let thine eares, sweet Lord, to heare attentiue bee, The voice and praier of my plaints, that now I make to thee. 11 And sith that Christ thy sonne, hath suffered for vs all, From endlesse death, to which by sinne we bounden were and thrall; 12 Let not my sinnes then, Lord, to me be stop or staie, Whereby my plaint should not be heard, nor voice when I shal praie: 13 But rather wipe awaie my sinnes for euermore, The burden of the which I feele, too greeuous be and sore. 14 If thou Lord, be extreame, to marke what sinnes be doone, Alas, no flesh shall saued be, that is vnder the sonne. 15 O Lord, if that the iust, shall no time able be To enter into iudgment thine, to plead his case with thee; 16 What shall become of me that daily do offend, And of my sinne and wickednes (alas) do know no end? 17 Most vile and wretched man, and caitife wo forlorne, What shal I do? but flee to thee, with heart berent and torne. 18 For mercie is with thee, increasing more and more, Wherwith thou didst vouchsafe to come mankind for to restore. 19 Wherein was satisfied thy iustice, and also Thy mercie found that which it sought, as we by grace do kno. 20 How feruent was this loue, to which thou didst vs bind? First by the law of nature writ in euerie hart or mind. 21 And then by law, which was in tables written deepe, That euerie one accordinglie, the same should hold and keepe, 22 Which was, that one of vs should with the other beare, And thereby to fulfil thy will, with pitie, loue and feare. 23 I knowing this am glad, contented eke withall, For to remit such iniuries, as vnto me may sall. 24 For why, good Lord, I know, thou doost forgiue to mee, Much more offences euerie daie committed vnto thee. 25 And when it shall thee please, to scourge me for my sin; I gladlie shall the same receiue knowing what I haue bin, 26 And that thy chastisement proceeds of verie loue; Which al shal turne to me such wealth, as no man can remoue: 27 Hoping after this life, my soule shal then obtaine, Which hope abides still in thy word, an euerlasting gaine. 28 Such hope my soule hath had, by grace thou gau'st to me, And by the same I firmely trust, my soule shal saued be. 29 The husbandman through hope, his ground doth plough and sow; The same in hope doth reape and thresh, that gaine thereby might grow. 30 Euen so will I abide, in hope of glorie thine, Not onely in my youth, ô Lord, or any pointed time. 31 But stil from morning watch, vntill the night of death, Which is, from youth vnto mine age, when life shal passe with breath. 32 Who so shall cast awaie this hope yer death proceed, Shal lose the time he watcht before, and want thy helpe at need. 33 This hope in promise thine, my soule hath safely laid Within the bosome of hir brest, for euer to be staid. 34 And verie meet it is that Israell also, Which is al faithful Christians, this hope should feele and kno. 35 For blessed is the man, that in the Lord doth trust, And who in man affiance puts, he surely is accurst. 36 For mercie is with God, and grace aboundant store, With which Israel is redeemed from sin for euermore: Amen. Domine exaudi. Psal. 143. The first part.Sing this to the tune of the creed Quicunque vult. [1] O Lord, long time I wandred haue, and gone from thee astraie. And lost the portion y? me gau'st, in wastful sinners waie. 2 With grace thou didst replenish me, therewith to follow thee; But lust and liking of the flesh hath driuen the same from me, 3 So that vnworthie far I am, for to be cald thy Sonne; My wickednes so foule appeares, and fauits that I haue donne. 4 Yet with the wastful child, ô Lord, I do my selfe accuse; And am with shame surprizd &amp; caught, I did my selfe abuse. 5 Wherefore Lord ponder my desire, and heare me when I praie, And for thy truth and righteousnesse, attend to that I sate, 6 Thou hast with gifts indued me, of bodie and of mind, And I the same abused haue, and shewd my selfe vnkind, 7 Thy iustice still dooth threaten me, with euerlasting paine, Thy mercie yet doth promise me to be restord againe. 8 Enter not into iudgement then, with me, I humblie praie, For in thy sight no man is iust, as of himselfe to saie. 9 We all by sinne our selues haue made more lothsome then the swine, And fouler to be looked on, wert not for mercie thine. 10 Which shall vs make like to the wooll in colour faire and white, When al our sinnes thou shalt forget, and cleane put from thy sight, 11 But yet the diuell mine enemie, my soule pursueth still, And hath brought low my life in earth, a seruant to his will; 12 And with his net me compast round, where vaine delights do dwell, Where lust vncleane and wickednes to bide doth me compell. 13 He hath me set in darkenesse such, as men that no life haue, Or as those people being dead are couered in the graue. 14 Now, Lord, My spirit so vexed is, my heart is greeu'd also. My conscience likewise witnesse beares of anguish mine and wo. 15 My wisedome, Lord confused is by reason of my sin, Repentance great my heart doth rent. to thinke what I haue bin. 16 I call to mind the daies of old, and works that thou hast wrought, The maruellous deeds that thou hast done, I muse on in my thought. 17 As in the time of Moses law, where mercie was not showne, And he that did the same transgresse, by death was ouerthrowne: 18 Yet in this hard and seuere time, thy mercie forth was sent, By prophets thine, with promise made, to all that did repent. 19 If thou in time of crueltie couldst then such mercie showe, Much more ô Lord, in time of grace on me thy mercie throwe. 20 I haue spred forth my hands to thee, my soule for helpe doth crie, As doth the earth that moisture wants, where water none doth lie? 21 That is, my life I changed haue, from vaine delights that bee, And haue my soule spred forth at large, that thou hir filth mightst see. 22 For as the earth that moisture wants, must barren be by kind, So if my soule be void of grace, no good is there to find. 23 But yet through moisture of y? grace from thee that doth proceed, Vouchsafe I may thy mercie haue, and that, ô Lord, with speed. 24 Heare me, ô Lord, and that right soone, for why my spirit is weake And feeble made; much like a man that wanteth power to speake. 25 The feare is such that I possesse, I readie am to fall, The strength whereby my bodie liues is gone awaie withall. 26 This feare of endles punishment, which I deserued haue, Had well nigh brought me in despaire, yer I possesse the graue. The second part. [1] Good Lord turne not thy face away, least I be like to those That do descend into the pit, where nought but horror growes. 2 Thou wilt not Lord the death of him that hath offended thee, But rather that he should returne, and saued so to bee. 3 Thou art the true and onlie God, the sauiour of mankind; Without thee there is nothing else that we shal mercie find. 4 Then turne to me thy countenance of amiable grace, And let thy mercie shadow me, while life I haue and space, 5 And laie not to my charge good, Lord, the sinnes that I haue doone, But them forget, and me forgiue, for Christes sake thy sonne. 6 And cause thy mercie to be heard, of me before the prime: For I in thee haue put my trust, alone from time to time. 7 Most blessed Lord, grant that I maie thy mercie sweet obtaine, And that right soone thou me release from my deserued paine. 8 With great repentance do I cal, my hope assureth mee, Thou wilt forgiue me all my sinnes, because I trust in thee. 9 I know that thou art nigh to all that call vpon thy name, And wilt direct their steps aright, that craue of thee the same. 10 Wherefore good Lord shew me the waie I ought for to walke in, I my soule haue lifted vp, to thee with al my sin. 11 Lord many times in deed thou hast directed me the waie, And I haue purposd in my selfe, no more to go astraie: 12 Yea, when I haue repentant bin, and vowed in my hart Thy law for to obserue and keepe, and neuer to depart; 13 The diuell my dailie enimie contriu'd the matter so, What his deceit, yer I was ware, gaue me the ouerthro: 14 And Lord without assistance thine, he vanquish wil yer long the kingdoms vpon the earth, he is become so strong. 15 Deliuer me from al my foes, for vnto thee I flie, And giue me strength, my God to do thy will effectuallie. 16 For of my selfe no power I haue to do the good I should, One for to wish or thinke the good that verie faine I would. 17 Thy mercie onelie Lord, it is by which I must preuaile, A man without the helpe and aid, of purpose needs must faile. 18 Thou hast with reason and with wil indued me I know; But wil (of force) without thy grace, must reason ouerthrow. 19 Wherefore, Lord, let thy holy spirit, conduct me in the waie, Vnto the land of righteousnesse, I thee beseech and praie: 20 Where thine elect and chosen sort thy brightnesse shall behold, With such heauenly felicitie as cannot here be told; 21 Not that I haue deserued, Lord, for to possesse the same, But for thine endlesse mercie sake, and for thine holy name. 22 Thou wilt not, Lord, the death of him that daily doth offend, But that he rather do conuert, and so his life amend. 23 This is thy will, this is thy mind, though I a sinner be; If by repentance I doo turne, then wilt thou turne to me. 24 And then shall I receiued be, and be reuiu'd againe, And through thy equity be freed, of euerlasting paine. 25 For whereas I by sin am dead spirituallie to saie, I shal bethinke me of the same, and for thy mercie praie. 26 My bodie now by nature weake, shal then in strength arise, And shall in glorie shine more bright, than doth the sun in skies. 27 Where now the same, ô Lord, is giuen to lust and lewd delight, Shal then arise al spirituall, and yeeld to reasons might. 28 No grossenes then, but that it may pearse through the thickest stone, And as for things corruptible, it shal haue mind of none. 29 Immortall it shall euer be, impassible withall, Betweene the bodie and the soule shal then no strife befal. 30 Thus Lord, Thou shalt bring foorth my soule from troubles al that be, And shalt mine enemies destroie, through mercie shewd to me. 31 Thou shalt them vtterly confound, that do my soule molest, If I by grace thy seruant am, and in thy mercie rest. 32 Good Christ which gaust thy life for me and suffredst on the tree: Preserue my bodie and my soule, and mercie haue on mee, Amen.

O Iesu when shal I ascend, and feele how sweet thou art, And leaue the earth and loue thee best, with al my soule and hart?

O Iesu deere, thou lasting light, whose brightnes doth excell, The cleerenes of thy beames send down, within my hart to dwell. O Iesu quicken thou my soule, that it may cleaue to thee, And for thy paineful passions sake, haue mercie now on mee, Amen. 12 [O Iesu, grant I may resigne] O Iesu, grant I may resigne my selfe vnto thy will, And that I may my selfe forsake, And cleaue vnto thee still. O Iesu grant that I may haue of ioy and inward peace, And of the paines I haue deseru'd, good Iesu me release. Sweet Iesu giue me inward ioy, my soule to feed on thee, And for thy tender mercies sake, haue mercie now on me, Amen. 13 [O Iesu sweet, I know I am] O Iesu sweet, I know I am but vanitie and sin, Vnconstant as the wind that blowes, and euer so haue bin. Whereof then Iesu may I brag? or what haue I to saie? Shal I of men seeke to be praisd? or yet extold for aie? No Iesu sweet, the true praise is, for to be praisd of thee; Wherefore good Iesu weigh my case, and mercie haue on mee, Amen. 14 [O Iesu, thou my glorie art] O Iesu, thou my glorie art, in thee will I reioise, And not good Iesu, in my selfe, nor yet in that mans voice That worldly honour may me giue, to set me vp on hie, To rule among the sonnes of men, and sit in dignitie. These are but shadowes to compare to glorie thats with thee, Sweet Iesu for thy glories sake, haue mercie now on mee: Amen. 15 [O Iesu here in earth we liue] O Iesu here in earth we liue, and soone deceiued are, With vaine delights y? earth dooth yeeld wherein we run too far. But yet, sweet Iesu, if I could behold my selfe right well, I should good Iesu plainely see, and therein truly tel The troubles that are falne on me, were for offending thee, For which offence I pardon craue, haue mercie Lord on mee: Amen, 16 [O Iesu Christ, vnder whose power] O Iesu Christ, vnder whose power is both the sea and land. Arise and helpe me to defend, by power of thy strong hand From such as lurke and lie in wait, and seeke to do me wrong, Sweet Iesu see how weake I am, and how that they be strong. Iesu make hast and come with speed, my trust is al in thee; And therefore Iesu helpe me now, and mercie haue on mee, Amen. 17 [O Iesu, comfort mine exile] O Iesu, comfort mine exile, asswage my dole and griefe, With thee to be is my desire. mine onely cheefe releefe.

O Iesu in extremitie, I doo appeale to thee, Wherefore sith that I trust in thee, haue mercie now on me, Amen. 19 [O Iesu sweet, for heauenly things] O Iesu sweet, for heauenly things I often seeke to find, But then affections of the world doo backward pluck my mind. Againe, I seeke for to subdue, the affections that do rise, But to my spirit they will not be subiect in any wise.

Sweet Iesu pardon and forgiue, when so I pray to thee, And for thy endlesse mercies sake, haue mercie Lord on me, Amen. 21 [O Iesu be not long awaie] O Iesu be not long awaie, nor in thy wrath depart, But mortifie that flesh desires, and lighten thou my heart. Send forth the burning flames of loue, cleane to consume for aie The cloudie fansies of my minde. which trouble me alwaie. Good Iesu gather al the powers of my poore soule to thee, And make me to refuse the world, and mercie haue on mee. 22 [O Iesu mild, thine eare bow down] O Iesu mild, thine eare bow down, and ponder my desire, Deale not with me as I deserue, to punish in thine ire. But me defend, O Iesu meeke, through mercie great of thine, From dangers such as may befall, this sinful soule of mine. O Iesu, hide not thou thy face, from him that cals on thee, But Iesu of thy bitter death, haue mercie now on mee, Amen. 23 [O Iesu sweet with mercy now] O Iesu sweet with mercy now, reforme that is amisse, And with the strength of thy great grace send light where darkenesse is. Good Iesu from my secret faults, doo make me cleane and bright, And from presumptuous sins, O Lord, defend me through thy might. Good Iesu cast my youthfull sinne, behind thy backe to be, And for thy tender mercies sake, haue mercie now on me, Amen. 24 [O Iesu, shut not vp my soule] O Iesu, shut not vp my soule with those that run astraie, But let the shadow of thy wings, my soule protect alwaie. Good Iesu turne thee vnto me, and clense me from my sin. Sweet Iesu Christ do not behold how wicked I haue bin. But thinke vpon thy mercies great, though I vnworthie be, And for thy painfull passion sake, haue mercie now on me, Amen. 25 [O Iesu sweet, giue me an hart] O Iesu sweet, giue me an hart, that is contrite and pure, A bodie chast that humble is, and constant to indure. A mind that is with heauenly ioyes repleat through thy great grace, A soule likewise to magnifie thy praise in euery place. O Iesu, for thy mercie sake, let these proceed from thee, And then no doubt I shal be sure, thou mercie hast on me, Amen.

His enemies that shal arise, shal fall before his face, And flee for feare as doth the beast the hunter hath in chase. His houses that be made for store, with great increase shal gro, And euery thing he takes in hand, shal blessed be also. Vouchsafe good God to giue me grace so to direct my mind: As by the same in time of need, I may thy blessing find; Amen. A meditation when ye go to bed. O Lord my God I wandred haue, as one that runs astraie, And haue in thought, in word, in deed, in idlenes and plaie Offended sore thy maiestie, in heaping sinne to sinne, And yet thy mercie hath me spard, so gratious hast thou bin. O Lord my faults I now confesse, and sorie am therefore, But not so much as faine I would, O Lord what wilt thou more? It is thy grace must bring that spirit, for which I humblie praie, And that this night thou me defend, as thou hast done this daie. And grant when these mine eies &amp; toong shal faile through natures might, That then the powers of my soule, may praise thee daie and night, Amen. A meditation at your vprising. O Lord this night who hast me kept from dangers all that bee, And hast me giuen of rest and sleepe, so much as pleaseth thee. Where other of my brethren poore, of better life than I, Doo wander vp and down the streets, and harbourlesse doo lie. And some with sicknesse are opprest, some impotent and lame, Thus doost thou deale with creatures thine to glorie of thy name, O Lord in sort as I deserue, thou hast not dealt with me; But hast me giuen wherwith to liue, in better case to be. Most mightie God, this day likewise, protect me from al blame, And giue me grace I thankfull be, with praises for the same, Amen. Athanasius his Creed, commonlie called, Quicun? vult. By faith we please the Lord, by faith we are set free, By faith we worke the will of God. faith will not idle bee. What man is he will saued be, must first the true faith haue: Which faith vnlesse he hold and keepe, his soule God will not saue. And this is now the perfect faith, to worship God in thee: The Father, Son, &amp; Holie ghost all three in Vnitie. The persons neither to confound, nor substance to diuide, For he that shal so thinke of them, from perfect faith is wide. For of the Father, of the sonne, and of the Holie-ghost, Be persons three in seuerall, and all in might be most. The Father, Sonne, and Holy-ghost, in Godhead equall bee, In glorie like, and so in might, and so in maiestee. Such as the heauenly father is, such is the sonne also, Such is likewise the holie ghost, al three one God, no mo. The father was vncreated, so was the sonne likewise, The Holie ghost vncreated, stil one for to deuise. The father without number is, none may him comprehend, The sonne likewise, and holie ghost all three one without end. The Father, Son, and Holie ghost, eternal do indure, And yet not three eternals be, but one eternal sure. Not three that number doo exceed, nor three vnmade certaine, But three in one and one in three, for euer doo remaine. The father, sonne, and holie ghost, omnipotent be all: And yet not three omnipotents, but one beleeue we shall. The Father God, the sonne is god, the holie ghost also: And yet three Gods we shall not saie, of Gods but one no mo. The father Lord, the sonne is Lord, and Holy ghost is Lord, Yet not three Lords but one in three, and three in one accord. For like as we compelled be, by Christian veritie, Ech person of them to confesse, both God and Lord to be. So are we by the same forbid, in any wise to saie, Three Gods to be, or yet three Lords, but three in one alwaie. The father is not created, begot nor made of none, The sonne ne made nor created, begot of him alone. The Holy-ghost is from them both, ne made, create, nor got, But from the Father and the sonne, proceeding had we wot. So then there is of fathers one, not Fathers three, we see; One sonne, not three, and so likewise one Holy ghost to bee. And in this holy Trinitie, is none more great than other, But the whole three persons be coequall altogither. So that in all as foresaid is, the Vnitie in three, And Trinitie in Vnitie, ought worshipped to bee. Yet furthermore it needfull is, vnto saluation, That we beleeue of Iesus Christ the incarnation. The right faith is, that we beleeue, and with one mouth foresho, That Iesus Christ the sonne of God is God and man also. God of his fathers substance is, begot yer world was wrought, And man by flesh and bloud he tooke of hir who foorth him brought. Both perfect God and perfect man, is he without deuiding, And of a reasonable soule, and humane flesh abiding. He to the Father equal is, touching his Deitie, But he is lesse then father is, by his humanitie. Who though he be both God and man, yet one is he, not twaine, That is to saie one Iesus Christ, for euer to remaine. One, not by turning Godhead his, into the flesh we see, But taking manhood into God, by power of Deitie. One, yet not by confusion, of this his substance sure, But by vnitie of person, which euer shal indure. For as the reasonable soule, and flesh one man do make, So God and man is but one Christ, which suffered for our sake. And then descended into hell. the third day rose againe, From death to life this hath he done, mankind to rid from paine. And after this ascended he, vnto the heauens on hie, And on his fathers right hand sits, one God eternallie. From thence he shal come down againe, a rightful iudge to be, To iudge the liuing and the dead, as he their works shall see. At whose descending, all shal rise in twinkling of an eie, And with his flesh shall him behold, in throne of maiestie. Then they that haue done righteously, Shall heauen haue for their hire, And they that haue done wickedlie, haue euerlasting fire. This is the true and perfect faith, al Christians ought to haue, Which faith vnles we do beleeue, our soules God will not saue. Praise we these persons three in one, and likewise one in three; As from the first hath bin, now is, and euermore shal be, Amen. A meditation to be said of women with Child. In time of trouble cal on mee, And I will then deliuer thee. The time drawes nie, of bitter paineful throwes, How long I shal the same indure, God knowes, O Lord my God I humblie aske of thee, Make haste sweet Christ, and safe deliuer mee. Although my sinne deserued haue right well, Such paine as this; yea more then toong can tel Yet ah, my God turne not away thy face, Nor me forsake, in this so sharpe a case. This wombe, and fruit that springeth in the same Hast thou create, to glorie of thy name. Opprest with paine, O Lord when I shall be, Make lesse the same, so much as pleaseth thee, And grant good God, thy creature may proceed, Safelie on liue, with mercie at my need. In Christes name, I wil my trauel sho; Now holy-ghost, come comfort me in wo. Come father deere, &amp; let thy power descend, O Iesu Christ, thy mercies great extend, Ah God; behold my dolor and my smart, Sweet Holie-ghost, my comforter thou art, Take part with me, and heare my woful crie. Exaudi me, Miserere mei. Amen. A meditation to be deliuered from sinne. O Lord my God, I humbly beseech thee, And Iesus Christ, thine equall in Deitie, With holie ghost of like power in maiestie, And three in one, and likewise one in three, Which is to saie, one blessed Trinitie: Grant that the power of thy diuinitie, May in this life alwaie deliuer me, From fornication and adulterie, From wicked sort of vncleane company, From sudden death, and cursed blasphemie, From vaine glorie and hypocrisie, From malice, hatred, and crueltie, From the detestible and great enormitie Of sedition and priuie conspiracie: From all false doctrine and heresie: From pride in hart and vanitie: From pestilence, famine, and bloudthirstie: From iust desert of slander and infamie; From filthie sinne, and vile iniquitie. And when as I vpon thy name shal crie; Heare my request, and grant me thy mercie, Amen. A praier for the Queenes most excellent maiestie. O King of heauen, of earth, of sea, and al things else beside, Vnder whose power, and in whose hands the harts of kings abide; Vouchsafe to guide our gratious Queene Elizabeth aright, That she in peace with health may reign and gouerne through thy might; And when thy godlie will shal be to end her liuing daies, Hir soule may then with angels thine, sound forth thy endles praise, Amen. A thankesgiuing before meate. For food such as we find, let vs giue thanks therefore, And not forget the poore to feed, with some part of our store. Let al our talke be such, whereby no grudge may gro, Our selues wel easd, and God best pleasd, Christ grant it may be so. God long preserue in peace and health, Our gratious Queene Elizabeth: Amen. A thankesgiuing after meate. Thou God be praised for the food, we haue receic'd from thee; And giue vs grace a life to lead, more thankeful for to bee Lord long preserue in peace and health, Our gratious Queene Elizabeth, Amen. FINIS. The poore Widowes Mite Who knocks with hope and craues in faith, shall haue their iust request; By loue who seekes the way shal find to port of quiet rest. To the Queenes Maiesties Highnesse. The initial letter of every second line has been highlighted in the original to spell the words ELIZABETH REGINA. Except your Highnes well allow this gift of humble mind, Lacke shall my hope the gladsome frute, it sought thereby to find. If gift with giuers loiall hart your Maiestie will trie, Zeale more than gift shall triumph then before your princelie eie. A Persian prince, in gratious part, tooke water of the well, Because he saw the giuers zeale, the giuers gift excell: Euen so my zeale, renowmed Queene, equiualent is with his, Though I offense commit to giue so slender gift as this. Remembring yet your Princelie woont, of clemencie withall; Example such hath boldned me, vpon my knee to fall. Great gifts of gold, and gems of price, poore Hunnis would present, If he them had; in stead whereof hee praies this may content. New yeere, and manie God you send, in health with peace to raine, And after when your spirit departs, with Christ it may remaine. Your Highnes loiall subiect and most humble obedient seruant, W. H. The Author. The initial letter of every second line has been highlighted in the original to spell the name WILLIAM HVNNIS. Who seekes with workes alone to win the life that shall remaine, Is far deceiu'd for ift be so, then Christ hath dide in vaine. Let our good woorks our faith declare, by faith we are made free, It coms from God, that goodnes is, no good at all in mee. As man himselfe vnable is, in thought to please the Lord, Much lesse to worke or do the deed, that might his health accord. Here I professe one God to serue, from secret search of hart, Vnto his sacred word to cleaue, and neuer to depart. No time my Prince or Magistrate, by will for to offend, Ne wish I woorse vnto my foe, than to my verie friend. In Christ by faith, by no means else, my righteousnesse doth flo: Such was his loue, such is my faith, and euer shal be so. The first Meditation. [Ah helples wretch! what shall I doo?] Ah helples wretch! what shall I doo? or which way shall I ronne? The earth bewrais, &amp; heuen records the sins that I haue donne. The gates of hel wide open stand, for to receiue me in, And feareful feends alreadie be, to torment me for sin. Alas, where shall I succor find? the earth doth me denie, And to the sacred heauens aboue, I dare not lift mine eie. If heauen and earth shal witnesse be, against my soule for sin, Vntimely birth (alas) for me, much better then had bin. And now despaire approcheth fast, with bloudie murdring knife, And willeth me to end my griefes, by shortening of my life. Shal I despaire? thou God forbid, for mercie more is thine, Than if the sinnes of all the world were linked now with mine. Despise not then most louing Lord, the image of thy face, Which thou hast wrought and deerelie bought with goodnes of thy grace. And sith the bloudie price is paid, and bitter paines al past; Receiue my plaints, accept my spirit, and mercie grant at last: So shall my soule reioise, reioise, and still for mercie crie, Peccaui, Peccaui, Miserere mei The 2. meditation. [Thou God that rulst &amp; rainst in light] Thou God that rulst &amp; rainst in light that flesh cannot attaine, Thou God that knowest the thoughts of men are altogither vaine; Thou God whom neither toong of man nor angell can expresse: Thou God it is that I do seeke, thou pitie my distresse. Thy seat, O God, is euery where, thy power all powers transcend, Thy wisedome cannot measurd be, for that it hath no end. Thou art the power and wisedome too, and sole felicitie, But I a lumpe of sinful flesh, nurse of iniquitie. Thou art by nature mercifull, and mercie is thy name, And I by nature miserable, the thrall of sinne and shame. Then let thy nature, O good God now worke his force in mee, And clense the nature of my sinne, and heale my miserie. One depth, good Lord, another craues, my depth of sinfull crime Requires thy depth of mercie great, for sauing health in time. Sweet Christ grant y? the depth of grace, may swallow vp my sin, That I thereby may whiter be, than euer snow hath bin. So shall my soule reioise, reioise, and still for mercie crie, Peccaui, peccaui, Miserere mei. The 3 meditation. [Before thy face and in thy sight] Before thy face and in thy sight, haue I, deuoid of shame, O Lord transgressed willinglie, I doo confesse the same. Yet was I loth that men should know, or vnderstand my fall, Thus feard I man, much more than thee thou righteous iudge of all. So blind was I and ignorant, yea rather wilful blind, That suckt the combe, and knew the Bee had left the sting behind. My sinnes, O God, to thee are knowne, there is no secret place, Where I may hide my selfe or them, from presence of thy face. Where shal I then my selfe bestow? or who shal me defend? None is so louing as my God; thy mercies haue no end. In deed I grant, and do confesse my sinnes so heinous bee, As mercie none at all deserues: but yet thy propertie Is alwaies to be mercifull, to sinners in distresse; Whereby thou wilt declare and shew thy great almightinesse. Haue mercie Lord on me therefore, for thy great mercies sake; Which camst not righteous men to call, but sinners part to take: Wherefore my soule be glad, be glad, and crie incessantlie Peccaui, peccaui, Miserere mei. The 4 meditation. [Most gratious God, doo not behold] Most gratious God, doo not behold the number of my sin, Ne yet consider with thy selfe how wicked I haue bin; But rather thinke I am but dust, or as the withered haie, Which flourisheth to daie in field, to morrow shorne awaie. my flesh rebels against the spirit, my spirit too weake is found, By sinne conceiu'd in mothers wombe, my soule first caught his wound, My flesh is fraile, too weake and vaine, to do the thing I should, And what I would not, that do I, contrarie that I would. Thou seest, O Lord, how weake I am, not able for to stand Without the succour, helpe and aid of thy most mightie hand. And what is he that wil not staie the man thats like to fall? Or wil refuse the sicke to helpe, for helpe when he doth call? If thou wilt laie vnto my charge, the burden of my sin, O Lord, the conquest is but small, that thou thereby shalt win. For why, thy glory and thy praise, in mercie doth consist, Vnto the which I yeeld my selfe, to do with what thou list. My soule shall trust in thee, in thee: and still for mercie crie, Peccaui, peccaui, miserere mei. The 5. meditation. [If I demaund what mercie is] If I demaund what mercie is, thou God wilt answere me, That mercie is th'abundance great of thy diuine pitie. Wherewith thou vewst th'afflicted sort, that on the earth doo lie: And what is this compassion then, but proofes of thy mercie? Our fathers old the same haue felt, and now in rest doo raine, And thou art stil the selfe same God, for euer to remaine. Our fathers were conceiude in sin, and so are we likewise: Wilt thou compassion shew on them, and children theirs despise? One faith in Christ we al professe, one God in persons three, As thou compassion hadst on them, compassion haue on mee. Ponder, O God, my harts desire, most humblie doo I craue; And doo away al my misdeeds, and so compassion haue. And as of sinners many a one, whose number is vnknowne, Thou didst vouchsafe to draw to thee, and make them all thine owne: So now vouchsafe most gentle God, likewise to draw me in, And make me righteous by thy grace, forgiuing me my sin. So shall my soule reioice, reioice, and stil for mercie crie, Peccaui, peccaui, miserere mei. The 6. Meditation. [Most mightie God, I do confesse] Most mightie God, I do confesse, ten thousand and times and more, Thou hast me washed from my sinne. and salued still my sore: But I through sinne am falne againe, and fowler now am made, Than euer was the filthie swine with mier ouerlade. How oftentimes shall we forgiue, ech other that offend; Seuentie times seuen, the scripture saith, which signifies no end. If man to man such fauour shew. that wretched caitiues bee, How much more thou, O gratious God, to them that call on thee. It is thy nature to forgiue, my nature can but fall; Though thou be iust in al thy works, thy mercie passeth all. What time a sinner doth repent, and turnes to thee at last, Al sinnes fore doone thou wilt forget, thy promise so hath past. Behold, o God, I turne to thee, with sorrow for my sin, And doo repent euen from my hart, that I so lewd haue bin. Now wash me Lord yet once againe with fountaine of thy grace, That I among thy sacred saints, with thee may haue a place. My soule shal trust in thee, in thee: and stil for mercie crie, Peccaui, peccaui, miserere mei. The 7. meditation. [Like as the guiltie prisoner stands] Like as the guiltie prisoner stands before the iudge so tride, With quaking breath, and shiuering lims his iudgement to abide: Euen so, O God, before thy face in feareful state I stand, And guiltie crie to thee my iudge, and now hold vp my hand. Nothing haue I to plead for life, no goodnesse is in me, Of sinne, deceit, and wickednesse, guiltie, good Lord, guiltie. Thus by thy righteous doome, O God, and sacred law diuine, Condemnd am I to endlesse paine, through iust deserts of mine. Alas, what then is to be said, or what is to be doone: For mercie yet wil I appeale, to Iesu Christ thy sonne. For neuer yet hath it beene heard, since first the world began, That Iesu Christ did turne his face, from any sinfull man Which vnto him for mercie came, with sad repentant mind: O Lord shal I then be the first that shal no mercie find? Shal I be he thou wilt despise, that humblie comes to thee? No no, sweet Christ thy promise is for to deliuer mee: Wherefore my soule be glad, be glad, and crie incessantlie, Peccaui, peccaui, miserere mei. Verses vpon the Lords Praier. Our father which art in heauen. A thing thou art fr? which all things beginning tooke their name, And thou without beginning art, that gaue all things the same. We call thee God, some Iehouah, some Tetragrammaton: By all thy names thou art the thing, wee all depend vpon. We be thy sonnes, thy children deare, and heires of kingdome thine, By which we do presume and saie, Our father most diuine, Which art in heauen, deuoid of shape that reason can deuise. Ne yet art thou there to be felt, or scene of humane eies. Hallowed be thy name. Thy name, O God, is woonderfull, though we the same abuse, And by thy name such things are doone, as make the mind to muse. The heauens aboue, the earth below, and waters vnder them, Thy name hath wrought miraculouslie, all for the vse of men. O maruellous God what is thy name? or what shall I thee call; Thou art in power omnipotent, the mightiest power of all. Then mightie powers of powers that is, vouchsafe the same in me; So worke thy will, that in my life thy name may hallowed be. Thy kingdome come. Thy kingdome euerlasting is, in truth and equitie, In fauor, loue and righteousnesse, to all in miserie. Bow down the heauens, O mightie king whereby thy grace may fall, That this thy kingdome might descend into the harts of all. So shal our sins be driuen awaie, our flesh made tame also, And we found righteous in thy sight, a perfect life to sho. Vouchsafe to grant, O heauenly king, this blessed worke may be, Thy kingdome stil to dwel in vs, and we to dwell in thee. Thy will be doone in earth, as it is in heauen. Thy will is good, our will is nought, thy will be therefore done, Such was thy will, that Iesus Christ, thy deere and onlie sonne, Should teach thy will to sinfull flesh, our wicked lusts to kill; And he thy will vpon the crosse, the same did there fulfill. O heauenly father let thy will in earth fulfilled be, Among vs men as with thy saints, in heauenlie hierarchie. And grant thy will so worke in vs, that we thy will confesse, In word, in life, in faith, in loue, and perfect holinesse. Giue vs this daie our dailie bread. Thy word thy truth, &amp; Christ thy son, is bread that we should haue; Vouchsafe our soules may feed thereon, most humblie we do craue. For man dooth not by bread alone passe foorth his vital daies, But by ech word thy mouth proceeds vnto thy endlesse praise. Fix in our hearts thy sweet sonnes death, and such impression make, As we thereby may cheerefull be, to suffer for his sake Such crosse as pleaseth thee to laie vpon our backs to beare; With shield of faith to bide the brunt. against all worldly feare. And forgiue vs our trespasses, as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs We know, forgiuenes is at hand, when we for mercie call: If we ech other do forgiue, thou wilt forgiue vs all. Such promise hast thou made, O God. from which thou wilt not swerue, And yet it lies not in our power, the same for to deserue, So weake is man, so feeble too, not able once to mind The thought that's good, or doo the deed that might thy mercie find. This will thy grace must worke in vs, our brethren to forgiue, Which grant, O God, that we therewith, in rest with thee may liue. And lead vs not into temptation. And though temptation needfull be thy seruants strength to trie, And that our sinnes and wickednes, by faith away doo flie. Yet Lord thy grace the same doth worke whereby we stiflie stand Against the world, the flesh, the diuell, winning the vpper hand. Thus of our selues, alas, too weake, temptations aie too strong, Thy grace it is must vs defend, else are we throwne along. Grant when by sin thrugh want of grace Great fals we doo sustaine, That then thy grace might visit vs and reare vs vp againe. But deliuer vs from euill. From ill that we by sin deserue, most mightie God defend, And rid vs free from filthie fall, of miserable end. Withhold thy seuere punishment, and let thine eie of grace, Take view vpon th'afflicted sort, and helpe our wretched case. From surging seas of worldly waues, wherewith we be opprest, Discharge and set our soules on shore, in port of quiet rest. So shall we then our praiers make, with conscience safe and sound, And by thy grace shall able be, our enemy to confound, Amen. The Christian faith. One God in persons three, and three in Godhead one, I doo beleeue my sauing health doth rest in him alone. The first, the Father high, Creator of vs all, The second is his onely sonne, the word whom scriptures cal. The third the Holie ghost, of both who doth remaine, O might, power and Deitie, coequall with the twaine. The word of loue to vs, flesh void of sinne became, Of virgins wombe by power diuine, most pure he tooke the same. And then for sinful flesh, his flesh was sacrifisde, His bitter, sharpe, and shameful death, as cruel Iewes deuisde, His flesh with whips was rent, his head be crownd with thorne, His bodie naild on crosse of tree, his hart with speare was torne. Thus al his bloud was shed, to death his life made thral, To pacifie his fathers wrath, procurde by Adams fall. He died and was buried, descended down to hell, From death to life he rose againe, he loued vs so well. When fortie daies were come, to heauen ascended he, Right from men of Galile, in faith to vs that be. From whence I do beleeue, he shal againe descend, To iudge all flesh, and of the world to make a final end. The dead from graue shal rise, the quicke shal chnnged bee, And euerie eie shall face to face behold his maiestie. By grace who hath doone wel, with him in heauen shal raine: By sinne who hath doone wickedlie, in euerlasting paine. FINIS. A Dialog betweene Christ and a Sinner. Christ. Arise from sin thou wicked man, before the trump dooth sound: Least thou among the guiltie sort, a damned soule be found. My sheepe why doost thou persecute? my lambs why dost thou kill? My selfe why dost thou crucifie, and guiltles blood thus spill? Arise I saie, arise, arise. Sinner What fearefull thundring voice is this, that soundeth in mine eare: Which bids me rise, and brings my soule, and all hir powers in feare? Christ It is the voice of him thy iudge, that shall thy iudger bee: Which bids thee rise while sunne dooth shine, that thou thy selfe maist see. For after sunne be set in shade, and darksome clouds appeere: Too late is then for to arise, if thou arise not heere. Arise I saie, arise, arise. Sinner. O Lord by grace I now behold, wherein I did offend. Christ. What made thee thus against my saints, such crueltie extend? Sinner It was my fault through ignorance, by which I might not chuse. Christ. And yet I saie thine ignorance, shall not thy faults excuse. Sinner. By grace I am repentant made wilt thou not mercie haue? Christ. If thou by grace repentant bee, yet must thou mercie craue. Sinner. O Lord blot out my filthie deeds, and clense mee from my sinne: Christ. Arise and walke, thou art made cleane as thou beleeu'st therein. Another dialog betweene Christ and a sinner, to be soong as the former. CHRIST. Awake fr? sleep and watch awhile, prepare your selfe to praie; For I mine angell will send foorth to sound the iudgement daie; That mine elect and chosen sort might find my saieng true: How that the time I shorten will, for them and not for you. Awake I saie, awake, awake. SINNER. And yet, ô Lord, the little whelps would licke the crums that fall The chosen sort are very few, but many doost thou call. CHRIST. I call to you that will not heare, I stretch mine armes at large, For to embrace such as doo come, and all your sinnes discharge. Wherefore if you refuse to come, I will you then forsake; And to my feast will strangers call, and them my children make: Awake therefore and rise from sleepe, awake, I say, awake. SINNER. Not so, good Lord, thy mercie far aboue our sinnes abound. CHRIST. And yet I will a iusticer in iustice mine be found. SINNER. Thy promise is to pardon sinne, and therein art thou iust. CHRIST. Your sinnes repent, and praie therefore in vaine is els your trust. SINNER. O Lord thy grace must this performe, or else it cannot be. CHRIST. My grace you haue, the same applie, and blessed shall you be. SINNER Through this sweet grace, thy mercie we humblie doo require CHRIST. By mercie mine I you forgiue, and grant this your desire. AMEN. A Conflict betweene the Spirit and the Flesh in the Soule of Man. SPIRIT. My soule giue eare to me thy spirit, of that I say to thee; Forsake the pleasures of thy flesh, and ioine thy selfe with me: Thy flesh is filthy, fraile, and fon and nought but sinne containes; Whose due deserts through wickednesse is euerlasting paines. FLESH. My soule not so great proofe thou hast of pleasures that I bring; Of loue, of lust, of liking sweet, and euery other thing: Forsake me not but ioine with mee, which am thy flesh and bone. For I the receptacle am of all thy powers echone. SPIRIT. If thou after thy flesh wilt go, then surely shalt thou die; If thou wilt walke with me thy spirit, we will him mortifie: For thou betweene vs both art plast, and at thy libertie, To whether part thou wilt incline, to liue or else to die. SOVLE. Alas what great conflict is this, I sillie soule sustaine; Betweene the pleasures of my flesh, my spirit threatning paine: I greeued am my flesh should lose, yet glad my spirit might win, But of the twaine whose part to take, my doubt is great therein. SPIRIT. Thy flesh is disobedient, vnkind and cruell still. SOVLE. Yet I poore soule indifferent, make neither good nor ill. FLESH. Remember my sweet soule, what flesh hath doone for thee, SPIRIT. Thy flesh for to subdue, sweet soule take part with mee, FLESH. If thou my part wilt take, we shall the victors bee. SPIRIT. If thou wilt him forsake, then heauen is due to thee. SOVLE. The spirit makes men religious. obedient and kind: The flesh makes men rebellious, and monsters beastlie blind; The soule through power makes them men as maker hath assind. Wherefore my spirit I ioine with thee, with all the force I can: Awaie packe hence vnsauorie flesh, the filthest part of man. FINIS. An humble sute of a repentant sinner for mercie. Giue eare, ô Lord, to heare, my heauie carefull cries: And let my wofull plaints ascend, aboue the starrie skies. And now receiue the soule, that puts his trust in thee: And mercie grant to purge my sinnes, mercie, good Lord, mercie. My soule desires to drinke, from fountaine of thy grace To slake this thirst, ô God, vouchsafe, and turne not off thy face. But bow thy bending eare, with mercie when I crie, And pardon grant for sinful life, mercie, good Lord, mercie. Behold at length, ô Lord, My sore repentant mind, Which knocks with faith, &amp; hopes therby thy mercy great to find. Thy promise thus hath past from which I will not flie, Who dooth repent trusting in thee, shall tast of thy mercie. Mercie, good Lord, mercie, mercie. Another to the same effect. [Behold, ô God, the wretched state] Behold, ô God, the wretched state, my sillie soule is in: How sore opprest and ouerchargde, with foule and filthie sin. Behold likewise the prison foule, I meane my baned brest: Where wickednes and sinne abounds, and breeds my soules vnrest. Behold O God, how oft my soule, doth lift her selfe to thee: As one in dungeon darke and deepe, desiring light to see, Behold also how faine it would, do that might please thy will: But cruell sinne with his affects doo draw me backward still. Behold I do not that I would, as lawe of thine requires, But I doo that I would not doo, contrarie my desires. Such is the working of the feend such be his wilie waies, With lust to set my hart on fire, whereby my health decaies. Such plesant baits laies he abrode with poisned hookes of sin, And traines my senses all thereto, and drowns my soule therein. But mercie is with thee my God, for such as mercie craue, Among the which I humblie aske, some mercie for to haue. For light offense thy mercie small, may soone appease thine ire, But mine offences manifold, thy mercies great desire. And sith by mercie I must win, thy fauor and thy grace, From my misdeeds and sinfull life, with mercie turne thy face. An other to the same purpose. [My soule ô God, doth now confesse] My soule ô God, doth now confesse, a wicked life long led in sinne: And how the same to thee is knowne, yer that my lips to speake begin. Such is the frute, such is the tree, with mercie Lord deliuer mee. Shall I, ô Lord, for this despaire of hope, of helpe, and health at last? Or shall I thinke thou seek'st reuenge, vpon my sinfull life thats past? No, no, my faith doth witnes mee, Thy bloud from sin hath set me free. AMEN A Lamentation touching the follies and vanities of our youth. Alacke when I looke backe, vpon my youth that's past, And deepelie ponder youths offense, &amp; youths reward at last: With sighes and sobs I saie; ô God I not denie, my youth with follie hath deseru'd, with follie for to die. But yet if euer sinfull man, might mercie mooue to ruth, Good Lord with mercie doo forgiue, the follies of my youth. In youth I rangde the feelds where vices all did grow, In youth alas I wanted grace, such vice to ouerthrow. In youth what I thought sweet, most bitter now I find. Thus haue the follies of my youth, with follie kept me blind. Yet as the eagle casts her bill, whereby hir age renueth: o Lord with mercie do forgiue, the follies of my youth, Amen: A Psalme of reioising for the woonderfull loue of Christ, ratified by his meritorious death and passion for our spirituall redemtion. Let vs be glad and clap our hands, with ioy our soules to fill: For Christ hath paid the price of sinne, with mercie and good will. By his good will he flesh became, for sinfull fleshes sake: By his good will disdained not, most shamefull death to take. By his goodwill his bloud was spilt, his bodie all to rent: By his goodwill to saue vs all, he therewith was content. By his good will death hath no power. our sinfull soules to kill: For Christ hath paid the price of sinne, with mercie and good will. Since Christ so deerely loued vs, let vs from sinne refraine: For Christ desireth nothing els, in lieu of all his paine. And that we should ech other loue, as he vs loou'd before: So shall his loue abide in vs, and dwell for euermore. Let then our loue so dwell in him, our wicked lusts to kill: For Christ hath paide the price of sinne, with mercie and good will. AMEN. A praier for the good estate of Queene ELIZABETH. Thou God that guidst both heauen &amp; earth on whome we all depend: Preserue our queene in perfect health, and her from harme defend. Conserue hir life in peace to raigne, augment hir ioyes withall: Increase hir friends, maintaine hir cause, and heare vs when we call. So shall all we that faithfull be, reioyse and praise thy name: O God, ô Christ, ô Holy-ghost, giue eare and grant the same. AMEN.</field>
