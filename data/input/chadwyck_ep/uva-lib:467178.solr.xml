      <field name="fulltext">“The great end of all the arts is to make an impression on the imagination and the feeling. The imitation of nature frequently does this. Sometimes it fails, and something else succeeds. I think, therefore, the true test of all the arts is, not solely whether the production is a true copy of nature, but whether it answers the end of art, which is to produce a pleasing effect upon the mind.” Sir Joshua Reynolds. THE NAKED THINKER. The house was broad, and squared, and high,— The house of Apswern's lord,— And all the lordly houses nigh Did with its forms accord; Their portals all four steps did dwell Above the drifting crowd, And all their windows did repel, Deep set, and heavily browed; The house was one of countless ones, All builded white with stone; And round its base for ever runs The hurrying people's tone. The room was wholly bare, and raised Above all other rooms, And its large crystal window gazed O'er roofs, and towers, and domes; The winds unchecked around it swept; And o'er all others high, Straight into it the sunshine stept Stark naked from the sky; 'Twixt it and the revolving stars Did never aught arise, And morning's earliest golden bars Its walls did first surprise. Now forward in this lonely room, A door unsounding swings— White human movings just illume The darkness whence it springs; The darkness dies, without the door, A man half naked stands; His eyes are fixed with thoughtful lore, Baring himself, his hands: And down into this lonely room, As swimmer unto sea, With stately tread, defying head, All naked steppeth he. Twelve times this lonely chamber round, This naked man doth pace, His globing eyes growing more profound, Scorn firing more his face; Each grand limb firmly planting, franks Itself its place's lord; His body, from its haughty flanks, Lifts like a lifted sword; He pauses, and like one who stands Trampling an emperor's crown, He lifteth high his clenched hands, He strains his stern limbs down. Before the room's large windowed eye, That stares from roof to floor, He stands; the sunshine from the sky Dazzlingly slants him o'er: With splendid perfectness, the sheen Kills every shade and haze, And multitudinous and keen His bossed form displays: Loud laughs he at the sounding crowd That far beneath him tides, Chariots, and dames, and horsemen proud, Corpses, and harlots, and brides. An infant's laugh's a blessed thing, Its soft fall smooths the soul; And children's laughter, when they spring Away from loved control; Such laughs are but the gentle lift Of gently joy-breezed life: This man's bare laughter, hard and swift, With scorn's delight was rife; His muscles glisteningly unthonged As burst each ringing peal, And shone like beach stones thickly thronged When bright waves o'er them reel. While sinks this scornful laughter down Deep in his frame, to thought, He turns from gazing o'er the town Like one by ghosts besought; He couches on the chamber's floor, His limbs like creatures spread; And writes he jest, or writes he lore, He writes with thought-stooped head; And ever and anon, while glides Over the scrolls his pen, He stops, and glisteringly rides His laughter forth again. Why seeks this man this lonely height? His fellows sport below! Why is he naked, what doth he write, Nakedly couching low? What mean the scorns that swiftly surge O'er his expanded eyes? Why do his mind-strung muscles urge? What is their mind's emprize? What means the room, of life's stuff bare As mountain hollowed grave? The naked manhood, nerving there, Like a tongue in its dark red cave? The abbey bell tolled fast and loud When Apswern's old lord died; And all the people rose and bowed, And mourned their nation's pride; He had led its armies through the world, Like sea-snakes through the sea; And he its flags of peace unfurled While earth blazed up her glee; The bell of the abbey heavily tolled, When they bore his corpse to its tomb; And the thought of death did arise and fold The thought of God with its gloom. But when Apswern's old lord died,— When pale on his couch he lay, So that the gazer might not decide What of him was life, and what clay,— When the weeping servants distant stood, And the tearless loving stood near,— When the doctor's eye forgot to brood, Regaining human fear,— When the frightened people in whispers spake Of the fears that they could not disclose, As children do who in darkness wake— The Lord of Apswern arose: And he said, “They think me great and proud, Their kings have knelt to me; Before me ranks of manhood bowed, Their looks no more were free:— I die a fool, a duping fool; I leave a veiled world, Wherein, by unsuspected rule, I thought no veils were furled; I sink within the senseless tomb,— The shapes I seem to leave, Now shake their masks, and midst the gloom, Some real glimpses give. “Duped, unsuspecting, from my birth Till now, my life has been; And yet I flaunted o'er the earth, As I all truths had seen; I thought I fought for man,—I know 'Twas for the thing man seemed; I thought to man my love did flow,— It flowed to dreams I dreamed; With armies I have lashed the world, And at my will it flew, I knew not what the power I hurled, Nor that I did subdue. “I die deceived;—but one shall tear The masks that lied to me; The lands that I bequeath mine heir, He but retains, while he Fights with his eyes against the world, Against all things that are, Mocking the veils around them furled, And scattering them afar; Through him I hurl detecting scorn At life's old harlot zone, I crush her masks for centuries worn, I strip her, on her throne. “Let there be lifted from the roof Of Apswern's house, a room, From every other room aloof, And bare as is the tomb; And stripped of all the clothes we wear To aid life's lying show, Naked from every influence, there Lord Apswern's heir must go; And there, alone, for Apswern's land, A tenth of each day war Fiercely, to rend life's seemings, and Drag out the things that are.” Long ere the worms had fretted through The clay that thuswise spake, The heir's dependents swiftly flew His lonely room to make; With wanton jests, with reasons wise, They forced him there each day; That he might seem in legal eyes, His fortunes's price to pay: Lord Apswern holds that old man's land, He works that old man's will; But now, though bound him no command, He'd work that wild will still. For minds, that underneath the blaze Of time's revolving things, Have learned to spurn what world-shared rays The troop, quick passing, flings— And stopping each, with stern command, Have forced it to disclose Its inmost soul, the unknown land It comes from, where it goes,— Can no more calmly passive lay 'Neath what things seem, than can Eagles, who've tracked the sun's bright way, Stare at it, down with man. And thus, though bright through Kensington, Lord Apswern's fellows stray; Ladies with beauteous garments on, And lords, with laughter gay; Making not sense a sword to teaze, Or fight the summer day,— The day, a sunny bright sea breeze, That breeze's bright spray, they; Though thus through Kensington they glide, While bright their light smiles play; No thoughts to strive with, or deride, And happiness all their way:— This day that joys Lord Apswern's peers, And seeks his lonely room,— He heeds not, though alone it rears Its face there, bright with bloom; Working his work, with painful throes, He broods, and writes, and raves,— Kensington's music towards him flows, He smiles not o'er its waves; His body writhes beneath his strife, To make men keenlier see;— Not for the glory of all his life, Should any I love be he. Lord Apswern's eyes are lightning keen, So keen, his world is not The world by other mortals seen, His thought is not their thought: Lord Apswern glows with glorious pride, That lift beyond earth's creeds, Its thoughts and laws beneath him tide, Hour storms he calmly reads;— But ever in courts, in marts, in farms, Whether we joy or moan, Yea, even in the lovingest lady's arms, Lord Apswern is alone. EGREMOND. Ages agone, when life was swift and bright; Before the originating Power had ceased His cycles of creation; when men found Oft in the morn, new beasts upon the hills, New trees amidst the woods, new flowers,—create Then first; when on this planet's vaulting shell, Man laid not down supine, but up, erect, Waited and watched; in youthfulness so keen, That days effected in his thoughts and forms Those revolutions, which, in these dull times, Long years alone can instigate, while centuries Toil with their consummation;—then, the sage, Who reverence won for sciences; the hero, Who made a nation free; the Saviour, Who human viciousness to goodness changed;— Did so within their lifetimes, with completeness; And gained a glory, and sustained a joy, The best of us may dream not. In this proud morn of time lived Egremond; His life a star 'midst wildly clouded evil,— Evil that speedily could be changed to good By competent energies. And Egremond His life did dedicate to effect this change. The world slept on; the creating Power toiled: Egremond, through the midnight, in his cell, Leaps with his passionate reason down the depths Tempestuously tossed, of human nature, Seeking the masked demons, that invoke Suffering and wrong: he pauses for a while; In thought he overbounds the travailing hour;— Past man's redeeming, he beholds redemption;— He sees beyond the hurtling cloudinesses, A fair bright time; he hears the vast rejoicings Of myriads changed by him to virtuous gods:— They shout his name:—divinely burns his eye, As though a lonely spirit of the night Were staring in it, and a flash leaps through His toil-worn face, and quivering, up he springs,— “Pour no libation, drop no useless tear Above my sepulchre, the dead feel not:— But now, oh! now; now, while this frame can quiver, And the hot blood leaps swiftly to my brain,— Now when the wildest hurricane of passion Were but a power to whirl my fearless spirit In dizzy transport,—while I would be driven Straight through the universe, swift as a leaf, So that my soul might widen to her fate, And throb exultingly against the storm,— Now give me fame; let nations fill the cup, And to the music of their myriad shoutings, I'll drain it to the dregs: it will be, is, Mine, great God!—mine.” Swift from his face all passion Fled, thereupon a magnificent smile: He leaned against the window, a full hour Considering his own majesty; Adonis, Gazing within the stream, endured delight As incomparable to Egremond's, As is the soulless splendour of the sun, To the enveloping smile of a new bride. The moon slants light on his sky-lifted face, Haggard with eager intellectual toil, Beautifully haggard as the face of a corpse, That, peering from its riven sepulchre, Lists to the resurrection trumpetings; He hails her wandering thro' the tranquil heaven:— “Beautiful moon! I would that thou wert God, Or that he looked on me where thou art now, In that blue chasm; so that I might tell him, And watch the love grow softer o'er his brow, The while I told him, all my mighty joy,— Creating love where hate was, peace where war: Thou art so beautiful, moon! that there must be Some present commune between thee and God! Speak to him for me, tell to him my love, His greatness daunts me not, for I am good:— Yea, I am good, for I do procreate goodness; Rapture unspeakable! though yonder skies, Bending down round to me, should fiercely frown One frown of condemnation, I should stand Unangrily; yea, glad—yea, calm—yea, proud. Power of infinite love! I thee not offer The parasitical and insulting worship Of terror wrenched thanks; nor basely seek I, By false disparagement of my goodly nature, To render thee contrastedly exalted; Thy greatness needs it not:—to thee, oh God! My soul extends herself in fearless love, And reverence that is ecstasy; if I, In moulding this small isle to harmony, Feel blessed—yea, so blessed, that this hour Is worthier than years of common life,— How vast must be thy blessedness, aye sphering Happy bright planets from the galaxy, Thereon inhoming us intelligents! Lover that knows no weariness! when all stars Turn up to thee their beautiful bright eyes, And pause for joy,—methinks thy very godhead, On its caressing firmament must lean, O'ercome with love! My soul ascends to thee;— Thou, infinite in knowledge, must be happy; Time sounds of life, which scare us listening here, Shaking our faith with their unanswered plainings, Play sweetly unto thine eternal mind, The discords of one deepening harmony!” The expectation of some answering, shaded Egremond's face; again he hailed the moon;— “How hast thou made the sky like one fair flower! Laying aside thy vestments, so that heaven, And the valleys, and the hills, and the floods of earth Gaze on thine unveiled loveliness, expressing Their ravishment in one soft smile. Like thee, do I arise in life's dark night, But not like thee, fair moon! would I descend Down in my heaven, but when I shall reach The zenith of my glory, from the top I would outspread a pair of angel wings, And soar to God. Yea, presently, must I die! When ended my creation, wherefore life; A life of conservation metes not me, I know creation rapture; what, creation, Save harmonizing elements!” “Yes, God!” He cried, and sprang into unsheltered space; “I claim, by virtue of the peace I make, Some dim, disorganized, sullen star, That I may be to it in place of thee, Teaching its heart all musics; through thy worlds Dismiss me glorying!” His eyes wild rioted; his brow upturned Pallidly grand against the vast empyrean, As though he heard, echoing from star to star, The voice of deity cry, “Come up hither.” THE WAITS. I had seen the snow sink silently to the ground; And beauteously its white rest Quieted all things; and the hushing sound Murmuring and sinking everywhere around, Blessed me and was blessed. I had seen the moon peep thro' the dark-cloud-flight, Then gradually retreat; And her re-appearing smile of gentlest might, Beneath which all the clouds sank calm and bright, Me lustrously did greet. And I had heard the ungovernable sea Earth's quietness loud scorn; I had marked afar his raging radiancy, And proudly, in his pride, had felt that he And I were twain god-born. But than the under-uttering hush of snow;— Than the moon's queenly reign;— Than ocean's pride;—more beautiful did glow One other beauty,—even now bending low I adore to it again. For on that night, while Christmas melody plained Our lonely house around, Interpreting wild feeling, else restrained From any utterance, in the heart death pained;— Suddenly, hushing sound, Came from a lonely chamber's opening door, A beautiful boy child; His pale face feared to dare the darkness more, His white feet hesitated o'er the floor, And many a prayer he smiled. Then tiptoe gliding through the gallery's gloom, His hands pressed on his heart, Noiselessly entered he a distant room, And stealthily its mellowed moonlight bloom His gliding limbs did part;— Till o'er a couch all bathed in slanting sheen, Where, lapt in splendour, slept A little girl, her childhood's sleep serene,— His look growing like to her look, he did lean, And a brief moment, kept Affection fixed, a reposing gaze Upon the sleeping light, Pleasuring beneath her eyes, and like soft haze, O'er the clueless beauty of her mouth's sweet maze, Glowing mildly bright. When suddenly, with intenser utterance, screamed The music's wild require; And as suddenly his startled countenance beamed In vivid palor, and his wide eyes gleamed With coming and going fire:— And then he arrested her unclasped hand, He kissed her gentle cheek; Till sighing, as loath to leave sleep's peaceful land, Her eyes looked sadly up, and wearily scanned His face, while he did speak. He whispered, “Hark! the music that you feared Again we might not hear; Wake! wake! it is very passionate, it has neared— It mourneth, like the wind o'er the moors careered— Listen! listen! Amabel dear.” Here! here! that beauty, which, than hush of snow— Than the moon's royal reign— Than ocean's pride;—more beautiful did glow;— He is that beauty; even now bending low, I adore to it again. Sweet peace to me the hushing snow had sent, The moon had given me joy, The ocean transport; but high thought-content, Begotten of all things—measureless—yet unspent, Gave me this gentle boy. For, from the sanctuary of this scene, Through the strange world around, That never knew happiness, that fierce and mean, Now whiningly grovelleth, with disease unclean, That deepening, owns no bound;— Where love loud rages, seeing throned the wrong That all his hope destroys; Where poetry pales, despairing, and for song Raves, till her utterance, erst so sweet and strong, Sinks to mere maniac noise;— Where even science hath fallen, with terrible dread Palsied his strenuous limbs, Dashing the diadem from his anguished head, And howling atheist howlings;—was I led; And, lifting solemn hymns, Nor anger moved me, nor disgust, nor scorn, Nor suffered I any fear: For when the drear was stormiest—most forlorn, This boy illumined, soft his voice was borne, “Listen, listen, Amabel dear.” A DEATH-SOUND. Oh! never sent Italian summer, a fairer, brighter day, Than when amid the wildwood he led young Rose away; Down from heaven's curving roof of all unshaded blue Sank the sunshine o'er the hills, and strong the forest through;— All the leaves did droop, and all the birds did dream; They passed the silvery fishes, slumbering on the stream; 'Twas the fearfully bright noonhour, and restless life had gained Its most unsheltered pinnacle, and failed rapture pained; For the press of the sunshine held the world; And with never a breeze or a sound, The golden air glowed radiant, While as ever the earth rushed round. Down all the happy morning the birds did flit and sing; But now across the silence there waved not any wing; They were sitting 'neath the trees, he felt her soft hand come,— It clasped his brow and swerved it towards her bosom home; He sank upon his pillow, resigned to think that this, If bliss might be on earth, was sure earth's happiest bliss: Then heard he through her frame the busy life works ply, But the sound was not of life; and he knew that she must die: And the press of the sunshine held the world; And with never a breeze or a sound, The golden air glowed radiant, While as ever the earth rushed round. “Why start you so?” she whispered; no words found he to say; “You are pale, you are chilly, love?”—again her lips did pray; He urged his ear into her bosom,—fast the lifeworks ply, But the sound was not of life,—he was sure that she must die; The life within his veins did press at every pore, He found no speech, and warm he felt her tear his cheek drop o'er,— One tear, and then another;—Oh, it seemed death dared not be, And he laughed, “I am well, I am well, I ever grow well with thee:” And the press of the sunshine held the world; And with never a breeze or a sound, The golden air glowed radiant, While as ever the earth rushed round. Now, distant wedding bells rang out; he saw her blushing cheek,— Of their coming bridal morning she thought that he might speak:— 'Twas then his brain sank broken; Oh, seek no more to know;— The worms will make their feast upon her coffined brow;— When she died in his arms, “forget, forget,” she said, “How I loved thee, love thee dying,” then her last look fed, And died against his face; Oh! is there reason, why Haunts me that summer morning, when he found that she would die; When the press of the sunshine held the world; And with never a breeze or a sound, The golden air glowed radiant, While as ever the earth rushed round. ZINGALEE. The war was over; the ship Sailed gaily towards the land; He leaped upon the deck, Joy-fire in his face and neck; A tear his cheek did fleck As he murmured softly “land,” “Her land!” “her land!” His colour burned high, His look assured the sky, Then glanced exulting scorn, When, on that joyous morn, Away, away, through the dazzling spray, He sprang from the ship to the roaring sea, And seized the waves in their savage play, And rushed with their rush, more bright than they; Zingalee! A myriad eager men, Thronging the harbour mound, With flags of fights sublime, With a myriad church-bell chime, Hail his returning time, And loud his victory sound: Bare-limbed, stand, In dazzling band, The noblest ladies of the land, Gracing his car;— Their white breasts bend, their arms ascend, And their eyes extend, towards his ship afar:— And there gentlest musics, and softest voicings, O'erpower the sense with intense rejoicings:— But away, away, from this proud array, In lonely delight to his bride bounds he; No lady-abandonment wins him to stay; He recked nought of power, or of glory that day; Zingalee! He has leaped from the brine; His visage smiles divine; The flashings of its light, Change, change, more bright, more bright, As dawn upon his sight, Remembered things that sign Her shrine! 'Twas here farewells were dreaded, 'Twas here farewells were spoken, And here farewells were hushed,— Here anew wild they wedded, Here gave they the love token, And here the last grief gushed, At their parting time! And now to acclime His gasping life to the heaven it nears, Here he takes the love token she gave with tears,— Her pictured self, as o'er him she hung, When her love from her loveliness all veil flung, “Drawn by herself,” so its jewels tell, “For one whom none other can love so well:” And calmed is his face, bliss-ful are his eyes, While over the picture low murmureth he, With voice, whose deep love signeth sweet self surprise, “Was I ever away from this paradise?” Zingalee! And, bright with the glowing repose, Of one long dwelled in heaven, To whom assurance great, Of the unchanging fate, Binding his blissful state, Suddenly has been given,— He passeth the garden where nestles her home; And fondly he noteth the roses, like foam Flecking the greenery round; The birds softly warbling; the breeze waving treen; The atmosphere sunny; the heaven serene; And the sea's distant sound: Oh! he noteth them all as parts of her; With her, through them, doth his soul confer, For she loves them all: He enters the mansion, with quivering frame He glides to her chamber, soft murmuring the name She was used him to call: There heard he a sound, That lovingly wound, Wild words around;— 'Twas her voice— And faintly it said, “Oh! nothing I dread, But that thou mayest be fled; No! bid me rejoice; Let me fly with thee even to the end of the world, But my life must, must ever in thy life be furled, I cannot even die, from thee parted:” And he staggered towards the room, And there, in voluptuous gloom, Her breasts all naked, and heaving, Lay his bride; And her beside, One like a man, around him cleaving Her quivering limbs, while still she moaned grieving, “I cannot even die from thee parted.” The river of his life stood still, Rose at its woe, And gazed with terrible will The abysm below:— A wild beast he rushed to the couch where now grows The deep stillness of love rite; back, hissing, shrank he; One long deepening howl from his crashing life rose; Convulsed, he fell senseless; his wrenched face froze, Where still lingered the sound of her wanton love throes:— Zingalee! He is born; again he is born; And unto his life of woe, He awakeneth slow, Moaning low:— He hath no soul for scorn; His mind nought questioneth, he is alone, Staring past everything, unmoved as stone, As cold.— Over his hand hath fallen her love token;— He seeth it, his despairing trance is broken,— He calleth on his love, his love, his love; Down on his knees, with clasped hands he calleth, Upon his love, upon his love, upon his love;— But no quick footstep to his couched ear falleth, Only the voice-disturbed tapestries move: He bounds to the air; Oh! music is there, And he gnashes his teeth, and teareth bare His bosom, and grovelleth on the ground His naked flesh, and howleth around:— He flies to the jessamine bower, where first On one golden eve his passion outburst; Fair, fair to his thought that heaven-time glows,— There oft in her arms did his life repose, 'Twas there, in the flush of their youthful pride, He walked a god, and she, his bride, Some robeless nymph, sported with flowers, Dancing her joy through summer hours. Still in thought he beholds her thus playfully pace, But another burns at each naked grace; And another seeks, with the flowers she wove, To fetter her flight, and constrain her to love:— The flesh flakes on his face! His eyes roll blood-blind! A corpse stands in his place! Its joints knock in the wind! And across the joyous town, Over the pastures brown, Beneath the sunny skies, The gibbering thing doth flee:— Dead on the moor it lies, Covered with worms and flies; Zingalee! Why weeps Zingalee? Words only conceal, Thought cannot reveal, The tortures they feel, Who suffer as suffered he:— But even did'st thou know, The worst of his woe, Still should'st thou not, Zingalee, weep; For thy tears might cheat his soul from its rest, To love thee still, and be still opprest; Seeing thee love another;— Oh! thou must not weep, thou must seem to scorn His love, and his woe, and from morn to morn All grief must thou smother:— Then crown thee, then crown thee, with jewels bright, And with joyous robes thy body bedight, Summon thy music, illumine thy hall, Dance and exult, like a young bacchanal, Greet thy live lover with love's wild glee, Zingalee! EMILY. Oh! listen, nymphs! to my distress; Tell Emily! tell what wild desire Throbs all my veins, and yet confess I would not lose the glorious fire. Oh listen, nymphs! in sunny wind, Emily on the lawn reclined; One of her beauteous arms was wound, Embracingly her pillow round; Her face and bosom, 'neath the sky, Backwardly lolled, in smiles did lie; Her face and bosom upward bending Flushed as with virgin shames; and lending Her hand to some caressing dream, Over her flowing limbs it lay, Where stricken by the sunny beam, Around it rosy light did play: And seemed those gently swelling limbs, Curving at sound of warm love-hymns, Towards fond minglement, though they Minglement made not, but did stray Partedly ever;—and the dress Which fell soft o'er this loveliness, Its glowing life all unconcealing, Yet shaded from entire revealing,— With witching modesty, confessing What matchless splendour still it veiled, Though oft the breezes, rudely pressing, The heavenly secrecy assailed,— And then illumed the couch of azure, And then the air did pant and glow, While shivering with mysterious pleasure, Like waves her limbs did lift and flow. Oh listen, nymphs! the sound of horn, Over the distant mountains borne, Disturbed her dream; Oh marvellous grace! She moved, she raised her brightening face; She rose against the lipping wind, So fondly its persistings wrestling, I almost thought she still designed, Still to endure its boisterous nestling. Glowing she sate; her lustrous eyes Gave trusting thoughts to far off skies, And sometimes glancing o'er our earth, Blessed it with smiles whole empires worth,— Such proud, bright, wild, caressing smiles, With pride and love so sweetly blended, That ever, when her gaze ascended, I watched for one of nature's wiles To lure it back;—or blackbird's singing, Or childhood's shout through far woods ringing. I glided towards her, hushed were words, By her I knelt;—to list the birds To watch the sky like her, I strove, But could not, all my life did love:— I could but gaze her blissful cheek, The heaven of her brow I could but seek,— The slightest varying of her look, The gentlest movement of her form, My nature to its centre shook With rapturous agony; a storm Of joy rushed o'er my startled being,— Giving me all her gaze, and seeing My quivering face, her eyelids fell, Swift to her brow the crimson flew, Her bosom heaved, her throat did swell, Around her mouth a new smile grew; Gasping, I sank upon the ground, Powerless of sign, or sight, or sound. Upon that ground her robe was spread, And on that robe was lain my head; Into its folds, burningly yearning, My lips went, pouring kisses, till I shook with ecstacy, and felt The pulses of my life sink still, And every energy to melt. Time was not then; how long I lay In that sweet death, not mine to say; From 'neath my cheek did something move;— Arising was my worshipped love;— Swift to my mind a strange thought darted, And wildly to my feet I started, “Where lay my cheek?”—I trembling, said;— Back three steps stepped the blushing maid,— A short soft laugh betrayed her joy, Her fingers with their rings did toy, With smiling eyes the ground she eyed, And “on my foot” her voice replied. Then forward that divinest foot, With the same short soft laugh she put; I saw the sandals gaily lacing Its gracefully arched instep; yearned— Whilst sportively the flowers displacing, It stroked slow the turf, whilst turned Its smooth round ankle, very slowly, Its inside curve out, askingly— That it and I again were lowly, My cheek upon it taskingly; My lips again its smoothness pressing, While conscious what they were caressing. Oh! doubt not how I strove to gain Emily's grace; all, all was vain; Laughter alone was her reply; “I die” I moaned,—she whispered “die;” Still smiling smiles, she backward drew, And bade me stay, and homeward flew. Upon the couch where she had lain, I sprang; it but increased my pain; And where her cheek had pressed the pillow, I buried mine; a little billow Of dew gemmed velvet, told me where Her breath had fallen, and of her hair I found the odour;—far I flew, Still she pursues, and still I her pursue. Oh! when was wretchedness like mine? Never may I be self forgiven; Encouched upon that foot divine, Yet ignorant that I was in heaven! Tell; tell me, nymphs! what hopes have I? For this, for this, did Emily fly. THE HAND. Lone o'er the moors I strayed; With basely timid mind, Because by some betrayed, Denouncing human-kind;— I heard the lonely wind, And wickedly did mourn, I could not share its loneliness, And all things human scorn. And bitter were the tears, I cursed as they fell; And bitterer the sneers, I strove not to repel; With blindly muttered yell, I cried unto mine heart,— “Thou shalt beat the world in falsehood, And stab it ere we part.” My hand I backward drave As one who seeks a knife; When startlingly did crave, To quell that hand's wild strife, Some other hand; all rife With kindness, clasped it hard, On mine quick frequent claspings, That would not be debarred. I dared not turn my gaze To the creature of the hand; And no sound did it raise, Its nature to disband Of mystery; vast, and grand, The moors around me spread, And I thought, some angel message Perchance their God may have sped. But it pressed another press, So full of earnest prayer, While o'er it fell a tress Of cool soft human hair,— I feared not;—I did dare Turn round, 'twas Hannah there:— Oh! to no one out of heaven Could I what passed declare. We wandered o'er the moor, Through all that blessed day; And we drank its waters pure, And felt the world away; In many a dell we lay, And we twined flower-crowns bright; And I fed her with moor berries, And blessed her glad eye-light. And still that earnest pray-er That saved me many stings, Was oft a silent sayer Of countless loving things;— I'll ring it all with rings, Each ring a jewelled band; For heaven shouldn't purchase That little sister hand. TWO SUFFERERS. 'Neath an Acacia's overhanging branches, That venture not to touch it; where the ground Is carpeted richly with the sumptuous greenness Of soft moss clustering;—tall, in graceful youth, With gentleness about its countenance, And mild reserve, as though itself it lifted, To find retirement from intrusive herbs Around it sprawling in indelicate joy,— The alone star of a large ancient garden, A spotlessly white lily gleamed: at morn, Leading the orisons of all the flowers, Soft its voice rose; when the hot noonday sun Was troubling every leaf to pleasant pain, Often o'erwearied spirits of the breeze Lapsed towards its sphere, and, softly bending forward, It seemed to tremble joyfully, the while They sank beside its fragrance; and at even, When the gently pressing dusk awoke to revel, Those not-perceived beautiful ones, who frolic In old umbrageous woods, whence swift they rush Out on fields moonlight bathed, to startle back In pleasing fear, who know the thoughts of flowers, Loving them more than man does,—there did visit it Troops of these gentle creatures, and they stay Each other to admire it, some entreat The wind to wave back the acacia boughs That screen it from the moonlight, others around it Press the elastic turf in lightsome dance, Or rest reclining, whilst all night it smiled The same mild smile: but neither morning's flowers, Who ceased their hymns to listen to its music So soft and full; nor spirits of the breeze, Who, fainting in its shadow, gained fresh strength Contemplating its grace; nor woodland nymphs, Who for its gentle smile selected it The witness of their loves and revelry; Dreamed—that within the centre of its roots, Ravaged a fierce and unopposed destroyer, Gnawing with venomous teeth its shuddering core, Sleeplessly raging. Distant a moth-flight from this suffering lily, Centred amidst vast interbranching treen, A temple of pleasure glowed with the light Dazzlingly undulating it within Ever with varying hue,—now azure, now roseate, Now yellow as amber; like one gorgeous opal It glowed, and in its vast capaciousness Exquisitely nerved life sought all sensations, Crises, and tides of pleasures. Festival Had summoned there beauty and youthfulness, The gentle and the gallant: its broad mirrors The company multiplies, the space disbounds, And its music strangely wantoneth, and aye changeth The hue of its light,—till pleasingly bewildered Its revellers doubt the earthliness of the scene, All precedent circumstance dazzled from their thought, All future. Suddenly the music sinks; Each knight prays to some lady, and with smiles, And downcast eyelashes, and fluttering body, Each lady grants the prayer; and gently laughing Low, tumbling, laughter, gives her beautiful self To his disposal, till the murmuring temple Holds only happily paired ladies with knights. Tinkle, tinkle the bells, the music riseth, To its voluptuous onwardings all move; The pairs commingling not; yet all together Beneath the golden roof, around the altar, Around the ivy crowned illuminate statues Of leaping bacchanals,—they move, they dance. Longer, and louder, the arising music Utters its challenges; in dizzy pleasure Each lady smiles divine, with swimming eye, And head fallen backward, whilst her partner gazing Down in her flushing countenance, whirls her on. They pause; the ladies on their worshipping knights Lean kind. Now float amongst them gentlest sounds, Confusing, folding them; with liquid light O'er filling their eyes; and teaching every voice Yet gentler lingering; wreathing round each pair Deliberate 'prisoning strains, resistlessly, Yet fondly binding them:—the music dies; Silence possesses the temple; amber dusk Fills it from roof to pavement, and therein The revellers rest. Anon the wilful queens Feign weariness of love toying, and again Entreat to dance. Now how the minstrels bend And riot in their task; the merciless music Sweeps eddying on, and on each lady whirls, And whirling aloft her draperies, her limbs Startle the hall with symmetry, like sea surge The light lace heaped above each shelterless knee. The merciless music gives no moment's respite, Urging all action it sweeps out all thought, Its secret hurrying notes bewilder sense, Utterly falleth on her lover's bosom Each eye-closed lady; with a cry of joy, Her lover takes her. From the temple's altar, Now steps the Empress of this festival; The peerless maiden, round whose crowned beauty Delayed the dancing, while the dancers worshipped The inscrutable splendour of her lofty brow As over all she smiled; she steps unnoticed, And all smile vanishes from ner downcast face: Hastily she quits her kingdom, and alone Threads with impatient steps the winding paths Of many gardens, till she reach the place Of an acacia, 'neath whose pendant branches That suffering lily smiles. Why is thy lifted gaze so discontent, Beautiful maiden? yon majestic moon, Proud bursting through the gathering clouds of night, As a frigate through a storm-tossed sea! yon stars, Happy resplendently! yon caves of azure, Nor storm, nor wind, can near!—have these no power To calm the trouble of thy countenance To fearless reverence; to assure thy soul To comforting love? Wherefore, oh gentlest one! Dost throw thyself in passionate disquiet Wild to the ground, scaring the woodland nymphs? Oh! why repulse yon sky? The moonlight pains her;— Uprising, close unto the tree she shrinks,— Its trunk supports her; whitely droops her face: The universe is the millstone round her neck; And she cannot lift her eyes. Anon, her voice,— Now scarcely heard, as from an outspent struggler, Now loud with passionate protest, now broken With powerless pity, utters— “Eldest of Deities! beneath whose reign Trembled no sense; when motionless, and calm, All worlds were still, unquivering with pain Of central fire; when no ocean rolled, Her serpent form in continent-strangling folds Around the struggling earth, thus torture claspt, Compelled to toil its endless orbit round, The jaws of its still tightening enemy Plunged deep into its heart; when no false spring Summoned out flowers to feel the sunshine sweet, And then with freezing rains and venomous blights, Mocking their joy,—over the delicate petals Of azure and pink blossoms, over leaves Shrinkingly sensitive and verdant, sending Filthily crawling insects endlessly, As a loathsome slow-dragged sheet; when human things Existed not, by momentary stops In their monotonous suffering, almost cheated To acknowledge life not torture, not a rack, Relaxing now and then its furious tension To hold alive its victims; when did never, Love—by his voice whose passionate affection Doth wondrously caress, and by the joy Serene and serious, in his face and eye Apparently enfeatured,—win swift entrance To each deluded heart, where, once received, He gradually withdraws his beauteous veil, In base and hideous buffoonery, To laugh, to rage, to soil; when cruellest Hope, Never did rouse and aggravate Desire, By promising displays, and amorous movements, In rapturous happiness to pursue him even To a bridal couch, that there he close may bind her, And unpossessed, spring from her pinioned limbs, Mocking her burning agony; when, never, Was trampling passion, or unresting torpor, Or conflict, or decay:— By thy remissness in permitting life To violate this deep tranquillity; Creating lidless eyes, to roll, but close not, 'Neath skies of fiery brightness; forming hearts As delicate as spring's youngest flower cup That thirsteth for the purest dew, to fill them Up to the very brim with leprous filth; By all that I have suffered, agonies Which in the cells of memory are not dead, But whom I dare not summon, even to witness In this great need;—Oh! by this very fear,— I dare not look behind, and all before Makes my soul sick, the present tramples me, I cannot stay, I cannot on, nor back— By all this horror, save me:—Hear! oh Death! Rouse from thy rest, and hear me, save me, save me, Mightiest of gods! Oh! save! I plead not ignorant, I not thee deem The portal guardian of some paradise, I seek no paradise, I seek no heaven, I want forgetfulness, I want but rest, I want but not to be. Shall I endure Resistless years of slavery to life, And when too torture-spent to feel his malice, Then cease! Oh! let me in my tyrant's presence Now tell him he is baffled, bare my limbs To his vile gaze, and scorn him with this glory, ‘Thine never more.’ God thou dost hear me! Ha! I shall feel my limbs, as I forsake my couch, Weakening, and weakening; up against the sun I shall hold my trembling fingers, and perceive Increasing thinness; when men talk to me About the future, shall I be very silent And inwardly smile. Oh! could one die for all! Or I be alone life-tortured! millions live; I am released, the rack remains, the tyrant Smileth immortal;—over those I have loved His cold eye rolleth. Heard I now, a noise, Not from the sea, and not from cloud, and not From centre or surface of the earth, but far, Farther than science telleth, gather, and roll, Of evident destruction;—saw I now Blackness sweep out the stars; and yonder moon, Shake like a vessel struck by opposite seas, Drop down precipitately, and suddenly stayed, Turn a dead face amidst the scurrying clouds As a drowned man on the waves:—oh, then! oh, then! While this tight globe did split; the maddened ocean Like a great white steed upleaping into heaven Its death leap; as mown grass the forests falling; The voice of an universal cry proclaiming All life at once withdrawn;— Suddenly would my soul befit its death time By wonderful growth, and suffer mightiest thoughts Of the glory of its storm;—the stricken world Grinding its atmosphere to thundering surf As wild it plunges:—with enormous joy, Feeling myself last-life, I'd hear all cease; And when the air grew icy, when the darkness Abolished vision, into the deepening silence Would I expire.” From her whitening face Now starts its lustre; closed, her quivering lips; Fallen to the ground by passion, she lies paler Than the lily at her side! Now, suddenly, Trembled the moonlight from the gardens; swiftly, Clouds swept before the moon; a swift cold wind Came, bending all the trees;—she shuddered, dead:— In her dark scattered hair, the wind snapt lily Lay with its lifeless leaves; from its bare roots Fierce sneaked their worm. Oh, friends! what secret woe Had blooded the vision of this pagan lady, That she saw nought but wounded suffering In our glad world! Children of earth! believe, Though but a moth flight distant yonder temple, It was no chance that led the lady suffering, To impart her fate to a like suffering flower; For it may make sacred every nook in space, May annihilate despair, alleviate sorrow To believe in a rule unseen. SONG OF THE KINGS OF GOLD. Ours all are marble halls, Amid untrodden groves, Where music ever calls, Where faintest perfume roves; And thousands, toiling moan, That gorgeous robes may fold, The haughty forms alone Of us—the Kings of Gold. (Chorus.) We cannot count our slaves, Nothing bounds our sway, Our will destroys and saves, We let, we create, we slay. Ha! ha! who are Gods? Purple, and crimson, and blue, Jewels, and silks, and pearl, All splendours of form and hue, Our charmed existence furl; When dared shadow dim The glow in our winecups rolled! When drooped the banquet-hymn Raised for the Kings of Gold! (Chorus.) We cannot count our slaves, Nothing bounds our sway, Our will destroys and saves, We let, we create, we slay. Ha! ha! who are Gods? The earth, the earth, is ours! Its corn, its fruits, its wine, Its sun, its rain, its flowers, Ours, all, all!—cannot shine One sunlight ray, but where Our mighty titles hold; Wherever life is, there Possess the Kings of Gold. (Chorus.) We cannot count our slaves, Nothing bounds our sway, Our will destroys and saves, We let, we create, we slay. Ha! ha! who are Gods? And all on earth that lives, Woman, and man, and child, Us trembling homage gives; Aye trampled, sport-defiled, None dareth raise one frown, Or slightest questioning hold; Our scorn but strikes them down To adore the Kings of Gold. (Chorus.) We cannot count our slaves, Nothing bounds our sway, Our will destroys and saves, We let, we create, we slay. Ha! ha! who are Gods? On beds of azure down, In halls of torturing light, Our poisoned harlots moan, And burning, toss to sight; They are ours—for us they burn; They are ours, to reject, to hold; We taste—we exult—we spurn— For we are the Kings of Gold. (Chorus.) We cannot count our slaves, Nothing bounds our sway, Our will destroys and saves, We let, we create, we slay. Ha! ha! who are Gods? The father writhes a smile, As we seize his red-lipped girl, His white-loined wife; aye, while Fierce millions burn, to hurl Rocks on our regal brows, Knives in our hearts to hold— They pale, prepare them bows At the step of the Kings of Gold. (Chorus.) We cannot count our slaves, Nothing bounds our sway, Our will destroys and saves, We let, we create, we slay. Ha! ha! who are Gods? In a glorious sea of hate, Eternal rocks we stand; Our joy is our lonely state; And our trust, our own right hand; We frown, and nations shrink; They curse, but our swords are old; And the wine of their rage, deep drink The dauntless Kings of Gold. (Chorus.) We cannot count our slaves, Nothing bounds our sway, Our will destroys and saves, We let, we create, we slay. Ha! ha! who are Gods? THE MASQUERADE DRESS. The hall of the dancers with light was ablaze; But for Cressida's presence the dancing delays; She, alone in her chamber, was sheathing her limbs In soft silk, that displayed all their forms and their whims; O'er her body, the same silk she brought with gay scorn, For the rind fits its fruit as this silk sheath was worn. Beautiful did she stand; pearl-hued was the vest; To her waist, by degrees, its rich colours increased; To her feet, from her waist, by degrees they did fade, And her limbs seemed all light in their faint masquerade; Like a young rose-bud's cup, towards her neck it did close; 'Tis the garb of a boy; her breasts underneath rose. The dance music sounded; she laughed a boy's laugh; And she shook her gay curls down a foot and a half; Then she narrowed her waist with a girl's waist-band, And smilingly strove with a boy's stride to stand; In a girl's gentle slippers she slipped her small feet, And she sprang towards the hall singing loudly and sweet. “Who cares for the grape, till his throat be dry? Who blesses the stream, till the sun rides high? What man to his mistress will fitly complain, Till she sport with his love, and increase it to pain? I'll lure him, repel him, repel while I lure; For the wilder his passion, the dearer its cure. “Love's a chase, and I'll fly; 'tis the flying invites; A thing nearly lost, shows tenfold its delights; Should chance dare dishevel my robes as I'm flown, Why, I'll turn to tread down the pert chance, and be shown. Tush! what though the vision my huntsman inflame, The more ardent the hunting, the dearer the game. “Should he flag in the chase, I shall happen to fall; And prostrate, and helpless, his name I shall call: He will lift me—he'll trick to caress me the while; And I'll be too faint quite to note the fond guile. Tush! what though the burthen his love makes to burn, The fondlier he'll pray me to hold him in turn. “Should prudes blame my dress, Oh! all beautiful braid, Yellow, crimson, and green, over it shall be played; Like snakes on their sunny banks, soft it shall wind, Everywhere where a place it can fancy or find; I'll not feign one repulse, but right onward I'll lure, Laughing out to my lover,—love makes its own cure!” REMEMBRANCE OF FEELINGS. Oh! never may the heart regain Past feelings, as the mind may thought; Departed joy leaves dreariest pain, But memory of its nature!—nought: Then cease remembrance to reprove; I shall forget, alas! too soon, Not that you gave me leave to love, But what, the heaven, that was that boon. I shall forget,—nay! World's alone! I shall remember, with dark fear, With mean disgust at all that's known, With self-despair's most lying sneer,— That this life loved you, and that then Its ramifications shot through heaven; And thrilled with measureless rapture, when Thereby heaven's bliss to you seemed driven. I shall remember I was pure; Fearlessly loving, ever, the whole; Sure that eternity's obscure, All paradised bright stars did roll, That bearing you, there I might soar, The joy in your cheek still wildly eying, Its happiness light yet deepening more, The more my strength rose, heaven defying. I shall remember each love scene, From love's first dawn, to this wild end; Your deepening clasp, your rapturous mien, The murmuring sounds your heart did send;— Take, take his jewels from your brow; Bend, if your heart be not cold stone; And I will whisper to you now, What the forgettings that I moan. I shall forget what was that heaven, Through which my loving life did spread; I shall forget the bliss me given, When it seemed you through that heaven I led; I shall forget how feel the pure, Though remembering their bliss divine; How pulsed the life yours did immure, Though remembering that life was mine. And these forgetting, all beside In life, will darken deepening gloom; The world of these deprived, denied, Will seem to surge, a reeking tomb; Such darkness may be truth, but when We loved, how different dreamed this heart; Might I recall love's feelings, then Perchance the dream might not depart. Then cease remembering to reprove; I shall forget, alas! too soon, Not that you gave me leave to love, But what, the heaven, that was that boon. Would, lady! that the heart could gain Past feelings, as the mind may thought; The hours might then give up their pain, And be with memoried raptures fraught. ODE TO THOUGHT. Whether you make futurity your home, Spirits of thought! Or past eternity;—come to me, come! For you have long been sought: I've looked to meet you in the morning's dawn, Often, in vain; I've followed to her haunts the wild young fawn; Through sunshine, and through rain, I have waited long and fondly; surely you will come, Familiarly as doves returning to their home. Oh! I have need of you; if you forsake My troubled mind, Whence can it strength and consolation take, Or peace or pleasure find? For the great sake of the eternal spring Of all your might,— Unto me desolate, some comfort bring; Unto me dark, some light: Come crowdingly, and swift, that I may see, Upon your wings their native radiancy. I know that ye must have a glorious dwelling:— Whether it rise Past mortal ken, where the old winds are swelling Choired cries; Whether, like eagles, on some lunar mountain Ye fold your wings; Or sport beside that rosy and tranquil fountain, Whence daylight springs; I know your home is beautiful; and this belief Brings glowing sunshine thro' the cloudiness of grief. Come not with softened utterance of the song, That gushes in your land; But as ye hear it, undisturbed, and strong, Pour it where now I stand; A glorious echo these hanging cliffs shall roll O'er this great sea; However far it speed, shall speed my soul Thrice lifed with glee; Will it not lead where I may clearly see, Countries whose law is love, whose custom, liberty! There is a noise within this tranquil heaven! This ocean has a voice! Through these tall trees a mighty tone is driven, That bids me to rejoice. In the clear greenness of these tumbling waters, I see a face, Exceeding far in beauty man's pale daughters! Bright and unwavering grace Sits round its brows, proclaiming heavenly glory; Around it leap the waves, roaring to whiteness hoary. Ye come! ye come! like stars down the dark night, Boldly leaping! I hear the mighty rushing of your flight, Loud music sweeping. The unconceived splendour of your speed, Is not more great Than the oceanic choirings that precede And tide your state; Fill me with strength to bear, and power to tell, The wonders gathering round, that man may love me well. EARLY SPRING. I always roved the woodlands o'er, In the early time of spring; But never had discerned before, What, seeing now, I sing: So faileth oft the soul to see The beauty round it rife, That none may think how sweet would be Perfectly visioned life. No young green leaves bedecked the trees, Only the thrush did sing, And his song rose not, but did steal, Timidly whispering; No flowers did paint the wind-swept meads, No fragrance skimmed the air; The sunshine on the ponds shone cold,— Cold were the paths, and bare. But the sky was blue with its own soft blue, And the sunshine pierced the wind, And would cling to the trunks of the forest kings, Where the shivering primrose pined: And there was not a cloud to mar the hope That shone in the soft blue sky; And the air was so clear, that the wrinkles of care Were smiled away from the eye. When, gazing round me, gentlest rest Into my soul did flow; Such rest as summer evening sends, When labourers homeward go; I knew not whence this rest could come,— The air was busy and bright, And the forest torrent raged along, Heavily rolling white. I laid beneath an ancient elm, Vexed to be made the slave Of influence I could not see, Or appropriate, or outbrave; But as mine eyes did read the boughs Countlessly o'er me wove, There came to me even gentler rest, And then no more I strove; But passive lay, till I surmised 'Twas the tree that gave the rest; And I sent my gaze through all his boughs, With loving and trusting quest: No leaves were winged, its sprigs and stems, Countlessly many, I saw; They all did flourish different wise, Yet none did apart withdraw. And I noticed they all were rounded soft, And feathered with buds of down; And, though hued with the hue of juicy life, Richly and greenishly brown, That these multitudinous varying boughs, Unteased with leaves slept still; Hence cometh my rest, I cried, and rose, And gazed at each tree-clad hill. And in bold relief against the sky, Everywhere round me, rose Innumerably, these leafless trees; And I saw the deep repose— Not a torpid sleep, but a living rest— In their soft and nervelike boughs, Spread betwixt me and that azure heaven, Whose lustre such vision allows. And now I maintain that the earliest spring, Though boasting no scarlet or green, Hath its own peculiar beauteousness, In the leafless and moveless treen; Whose branches sleep in the golden air, Passively bearing its tide; Soft with the down of a thousand buds, Unitedly branching wide. THE GEM OF COQUETTES. A song! a song! Kate, a song! To your spirited stomacher sure must belong! Curving out, With pertinent pout, The most exquisite orb in creation above; Displaying the grace Of each neighbouring place, And the forms of the limbs that beneath him move; Oh! why seem severe! Why, why should you fear Your stomacher's history, mistress, to hear! You gave him his place, and taught him to ride, Soon after you from your bed did slide;— From bosom to knee, So unreasonably, Your shape was veiled, that the glass did frown, And so you took With your wickedest look, This gem of coquettes, and bound him down, To wanton and pout, And show you out, And make all your lovers grow very devout. And truly with all the most gallant of airs, Through the parlours he rides you, he rides you up stairs, Seeming to say,— Here I'm ordered to stay, The underneath beauty to guard and invest;— While slily he shows, How each moment that flows, That beauty against him swells scornful protest; And well though he knows, How his tricks expose, With exquisite insolence, on he goes. A truce! a truce! mistress, a truce! In a moment this history I will reduce, If you'll let me kneel, And gently steal, From this gem of coquettes a devotional kiss;— Else I follow him still, Till at midnight's thrill, You bid him good-bye; and much more than this Will I boldly relate, And with song celebrate, Of him, and his fellows too, beautiful Kate. A DEVELOPMENT OF IDIOTCY. Fearful the chamber's quiet; the veiled windows Admit no breath of the out-door throbbing sunshine; She moans in the bed's dusk;—some sharp revulsion Shuddereth her lips as though she strives to cry, But finds no voice: she draweth up her limbs, They flutter fast and shake their covering. Seven watch her, as might men a noonday sun, Who vanishing backward in the top of heaven, Leaves them all blindly staring through the dark;— Physicians and servitors;—pryingly they bend, While by her head kneels one in agony. A gloom seems passing o'er her countenance, As the shadow of a cloud across a field; Perchance the ghastly expression of the horror With which life ends: it darkened but a moment; Now she turns white as stone, as fixed, as dead. God! ten days hence she laughed out in thy sunshine! Her filmed eyes looked, gestured happiness!— They have no look at all. The seven shuffle from the bed which hides Her clutching fingers, and her doubled limbs, So stiffening 'twixt its sheets; and one by one, They coweringly glance towards her fallen mouth, And all together hurry from out the room, Not caring to leave it singly. All is still; He rises from the ground, fast locks the door, Breaks through her couch-clothes, feels about her heart;— All there is motionless: he lifts her hand;— There is nothing but dead form, it moves not, warms not, It weighs, it slides away, it drops like lead, Lies where it dropped: recoiling, the man gasps, As though by ocean seized: his jaws contract, He bounds, he rends the window; savagely Looking right up into the broad blue sky, No congruous curses aid him,—he is silent, Save with his clenched hands, his writhing face, His heaving chest. He was a force-filled man, Whom the wise envy not; his passionate soul, Being mighty to detect life's secret beauty, Detecting, would display; and in his youth, When first bright visions unveiled before his gaze Their moral loveliness and physical grace, With the sweet melody of affectionate clamour He sang them to the world, and bade it worship: But the world unrecognized his visions of goodness, Or recognizing, hated them and him. As some full cloud foregoes his native country Of sublime hills, where bask'd he near to heaven, And descends gently on his shadowy wings Through the hot sunshine to refresh all creatures; So came he to the world;—as the same cloud Might slowly wend back to his Alpine home, Unwatering the plain,—so left he men Who knew not of their loss. Yet sad was loneliness, and never beheld he Aught beautiful amidst our world of beauty— From sunsets flushing heaven with sudden crimson, To the moth's wing that spots the poplar leaf; Never developed he fact, or dreamed he glory, Without being faint for sympathy,—that one Might share with him his blissful adoration, Loving even as he loved. This holy want Wasted him unto sickness: then she came; And while he hung above death's gloomy gulf, Sternly considering its maddening stillness, Measuring the plunge;—her soft voice called to him: He turned; he saw her eyes his soul acquring; He saw her look of woman's infinite giving; He saw her arms of eloquent entreaty, Praying indeed to clasp him: yea, she saved; And Oh! but he was happy, for her being Loved all things as he loved, and thence to him Came hope and rapturous quiet. Then, no more Lamented he the wingless minds of men, Than pines the swan,—who down the midnight river, Moves on considering the reflected stars,— Because dark reptiles burrowing in the ooze, Care not for starry glories. She is dead within that bed; and never more Will she hearken to his dreams of paradise, And wind her arms around him, sweetly paling With excess of happiness. Three days and nights he haunted a near mountain; The sky was cloudless, and the sunshine strong, And not one mournful breeze ever stole to him, Loosening his tears. High on its top he stood; His voice rose solemn, and loud, and fearlessly:— The angels watching him midway in the air, Rushed swift to heaven, and all heaven's shining group Weepingly pleaded against his blasphemy;— “Roll back! thou lying robe of halcyon blue! And let me speak unto thy cowering Lord, The slayer of my love, that I may tell him My infinite hate, that he may slaughter me: He has killed her: I will not have his life;— Thou lying robe of halcyon blue! roll back!” The peaks prolonged with echoings his defiance; Still the sky stirred not—still the sunshine smiled, And beneath the smile low rose a low wild sound:— “And then my breast will be as cold as hers,— My face as white—as signless.” The fourth day, back he rushed into the chamber, Where she lay coffined. None dared speak to him; Great grief is majesty; he is alone. Oh! is that she, or can it all be dreaming! Fine lace is plaited round her countenance; Her eyes are closed, as they would seem to say, “My last farewell is taken.” Round her lips Is fixed a sweet smile; her shrunken hands Are clasped upon her bosom, their dark fingers Cunningly hidden. Can it all be dreaming! Striving to stare the mistiness from his eyes, Griping his throat, he lightly presses her hand,— The pressure of his fingers doth not vanish;— Senseless he falls. This singer of the beautiful, who retreated Back from a scowling world; this force-filled man, Who finding nothing whereunto he might sing, Of power unuttered, and of passion unshared, Nigh died; this gentle minister of love, Who, hailed by loving sympathy, thrice lived, In singing his deities, and seeing them loved, And loving their lover, and forgetting all else;— Is now a thing that hideth most fair weathers, Outwandering in most glooms,—after whose path The village boys shout “idiot,” that some sport His face may make them, when it turns enraged With idiot rage, that slinks to empty smiles, And tears, and laughter, empty. His chief habit Is secretly rending piecemeal beauteous flowers;— He ever shows when the groaning thunder toils, And when the lightnings flash! and they who meet His shrinking, shuddering, blank countenance, Wonder to heaven with somewhat shaken trust. YOUTH'S DEPARTURE. Oh! all the bliss of youth must end, His boundless trust, his fancied home, His noble instinct to expend His heart away where'er he roam; Even Nature's face will take his gaze, And glance him back no thrill; He'll wander down life's thousand ways, And be a wanderer still. This is his doom!—to look around With eyes unused to gloom, And find no splendour deck the ground, No song, no scent, no bloom: This is his doom!—to watch decaying, As soon as it dawns, the light; To follow the morning, bravely straying, And meet with a dreary night. And thus to see your youth departing, Is to watch your chain clenched on; Blow after blow fresh anguish darting;— Oh! when will youth be gone! 'Tis to find yourself all lonely leaving A friend o'ercrowded shore, In a wizard barque, whose rudderless heaving, Will waft you back no more. HIGH SUMMMER. I never wholly feel that summer is high, However green the trees, or loud the birds, However movelessly eye winking herds, Stand in field ponds, or under large trees lie,— Till I do climb all cultured pastures by, That hedged by hedgerows studiously fretted trim, Smile like a lady's face with lace laced prim, And on some moor or hill that seeks the sky Lonely and nakedly,—utterly lie down, And feel the sunshine throbbing on body and limb, My drowsy brain in pleasant drunkenness swim, Each rising thought sink back, and dreamily drown, Smiles creep o'er my face, and smother my lips, and cloy, Each muscle sink to itself, and separately enjoy. A HAPPY SADNESS. One smile is all thy brow, love, Thine eyes are all delight; And many a sprite I trow, love, Watches thee through the night; But though thy brow and eyes, With deep delight are glad, Though most thy joy I prize, Yet I am sad. I joy to watch thy brow, love, When not toward me its sky; When glorious thought, as now, love, Bright riots in thine eye; But when thy steadfast gaze Of love o'erfills my heart, No answering glance I raise, But tears will start. Oh! do not read my sigh, love, As if it languaged woe; In silence I would die, love, Ere woe to thee I'd show; Nor deem that I repine Intenser love to wring; As heaven is earth's thou'rt mine;— Yet tears will spring. For I can never speak, love, One half the faith I feel; And song is all too weak, love, My passion to reveal; And music hath no measure, In nature nought can be, To sign how vast the treasure,— Thy love to me. And how cans't thou believe, love, The love I cannot speak; And sometimes may'st thou grieve, love, To think my passion weak; Oh! heaven-souled! well I heed Heaven's love should'st thou have had; Mine's heaven's, but cannot plead, And I am sad. HARDINESS OF LOVE. Oh! Love is a hardy flower, That anywhere will blow; In sunshine, or in shower, In happiness, or woe:— A lady, sitting lone, Was very sadly singing; “No hope pervades my moan, Despair my heart is wringing; I lured him from the side Of one who loved him well; And now a maniac bride She fills a maniac's cell; He sought my love for peace, And when it could not be, His prayers did wildly cease, He died in pardoning me.” Oh! Love is a hardy flower, That anywhere will blow; In sunshine, or in shower, In happiness, or woe:— A youth was passing by, And heard this lady's strain, And answered, “Guiltier I, Would death would end my pain; A girl had made her heart A glorious throne for me, From all she did depart, And brought to me its key; I loved her not, I took, And I did coldly prey; Then drave her with my look, To mart her charms away.” Oh! Love is a hardy flower, And anywhere will blow; In sunshine, or in shower, In happiness, or woe:— To the lady's eyes, did look The youth's, with pity dim; And when her hand he took, She looked the same to him; Her cheek to his he pressed, Their forms together fell, And though they wept,—the rest 'Twere very vain to tell;— For love is a hardy flower, That anywhere will blow; In sunshine, or in shower, In happiness, or woe. A SLAVE'S TRIUMPH. “Death to the aristocrats!” the people roared,— Death to my master—each man fiercely thought,— As through the capital of France they poured, A revolution's mob, with madness fraught: Before a stately building paused one band; Awhile its leader bade them there abide; And where his Lord and his Lord's kindred stand, He sprang and cried— “Where is your scorn! where is the insolent eye, Narrowing its lids to look at me; where, where, The averted face that seemed wrenched awry, Sick at my presence, that ye yet did bear, Even to enslave me! seem thus sick once more! With narrowing eyes now speak me your decree! For beneath your palace, human tigers roar! I hold the key! “You merciless wretches! what! you kneel, you whine, To smile to me, you dare! one smile again, And the mob is rending ye:—rise, masters mine! I'll give you a boon to see your old disdain; To hear your words, slow, insolent, as of yore Chuckle at the shame they knew they burned through me; For beneath your palace, human tigers roar! I hold the key! “God! how they hate me! this, this, this, is life! Aha! white fiends! I am merciless! one hour Ago, and ye might have slain me with the knife, When 'neath your whips my flesh did shrink and cower! Had ye but known, when to slay me ye forbore, How I drank your blood, while I for life did plea! For the tigers are starved that underneath you roar! And I hold the key! “Can you not tell these avengers of my shame How I loathe, despise them;—ye were saved, saved, saved! The beasts have licked your feet, and again would tame! Aha! they will sword you when this hand is waved! They will wrench your hearts out! stumble in your gore! Can you not speak them! beasts they are like ye! But mine, mine, mine! for you they rage and roar! I hold the key! INACTIVITY. On such a day as this, when songs of birds, Floating through wide flung windows, upon breezes Woodbine and clover scented, gently trouble The happy and basking spirit to desires For yet more happiness; when the rich hedges Sleep on the fields so still and sunnily, That housemen long to go and lie beside them, In their long grass, hay dry, and poppy thronged, To make companions of the grasshoppers, And sleepily dream towards the insect motives Impelling their quick leaps;—who has not taken His country staff, unto the household saying, “I go to seek if of the flowers of spring, One violet be left,” and quietly strolled Lonesomely out unto the fields and trees, Entering upon the broad brown waving meadows, As a seafowl giving herself unto the sea, When its waves are calm; and then beneath some hedge, Yieldingly lain himself in pleasant languor: Letting his head fall deep amidst the hay, His eyelids shutting out the external world, His mind considering nothing, pleasantly powerless; Or if perchance a stray thought steals to it, 'Tis of its own tranquillity. The sunshine of this summer afternoon, Not in my parlour entered; but abroad Copiously as ever, it everywhere dwelt; Surrendering itself up unto each tree, To be spilled about on all the leaves and twigs, Sleeping in all the secret crevices Of the rich rose; broad o'er the sweeping hills, The swelling meadows, and the spangled gardens, Benignantly outspread. I gazed, and gazed; I gave a moment to encase my books, And I was in the sunshine, and my blood Sprang at its greeting. I was in the fields, And up around me sprang the larks like rockets On a jubilee day:—a bank of sand surmounting, I stepped into a wood, with pleasant care, Opening the twining branches, that imposed Desirable hindrance: angrily screamed A swiftly darting throstle on before me; Two bees adown the narrow pathway flew, And a bewildered butterfly; I stayed, To joy in the delicious noise of leaves, In the fresh earthy smells;—I wandered on, Past the slow pacing pheasant, and the jay, Who would not let me leave him, but still followed With his harsh scream. And now I reached an opening, A short turfed lawn, that fenced by silvery stems Of circling beeches, seemed a quiet home. I entered; flowingly between the trees Floated the blackbird's strains; they paused, I paused; Raising in sympathy to the tranquil heaven My tranquil thought; like a great eye it shone, It seemed to bend in love; I gazed, and gazed; Its look sank nearer me; I gasped, I fell, Panting to be embraced up by the heaven, As virgin womanhood for love's caress; My soul close clung to that far stretching glory, 'Neath which I reeled: it stretched there undisturbed By tower or boundary, and my tranced spirit Passively drank in its elysian calm. Oh, blue, blue sky! oh, fathomlessly blue sky! Your motionless band of silvery cloudlets, Like white swans sleeping on a windless lake, In happy undesiring repose,—were not More compassed by you, more retired within you, Than I, in that blest time; nor wish, nor thought, Nor hope, nor grief, found room within my being, Filled with your beautiful presence. Within the sanctuary of these circling trees, Thus lay I, slave to the sky; when a white deer, Noiselessly through the intertangled boughs Did thrust his head; he shrank, and in the forest Back vanished, most like a silvery cloud. Retreating, he had shaken on my face A blown convolvolus; the which upholding Against the sun, that I might read its veins, From its recess a crimson-scaled wonder, A ladybird with richly-spotted wings Soared through the sunshine. Now from heaven's thraldom My mind this insect's flight enfranchised; And being freed to all the things around, They all impressed me. Now I heard the partridge Make the copse echo with his cheerful crow; Anon my pulsings seemed to keep the time Of the cuckoo's music; in the sun's faint streamings, I watched the twinkling bands of tipsy insects; I watched the sun's gold lustre through the leaves, Illuminating all their make, descend, As the breeze swerved them into it for a moment, Letting them drop again. A hundred beauties, Words will not image, thronged my echoing soul; And she from all instinctively did abstract Their capital feature; life,—a massive lyre, On my proud thought-directed vision rose, Swinging within its home of boundlessness, Singing for ever in an Eternal Breeze, Of whom, this landscape, with its gentle beauty, Was one soft utterance. A little while, The contemplation of this abstract thought, Possessed me with content; but soon there came, Like a chill wind, a sense of gloominess. The heavens were blue; “Yes,” sighed I, “they are blue, But what of blue?” the birds continued singing, But song seemed nought; the leaves were green and golden; “Oh,” moaned I, “what good in green or golden, Or trees, or birds, or skies, or anything?” The unity in the boundlessness of life, Gave me no thrill. Philosophy! expound me whence this gloom; And why, when I had called the village cur, As he rushed hare chasing through my lonely glade; And had made the circles of his eyes grow brighter, His tail quick wag out with exuberant joy, His teeth affectionately bite my hand,— By my caresses,—unobserved by me, The gloomful pain did pass from out my being; Leaving a tranquil sadness, that but waited A change of place, to grow to cheerful calm! Is it that man is all too great, to rest The passive slave of any heaven or earth, Of nature's shows and forces? Of a God, Hath man the causative destiny and essence? Must he fulfil such destiny, or find pain? And rose within my being this troubling gloom From passiveness continued? Did it pass, While I was making glad the village cur, Because I commenced to infiuence? The hermit Must have his redbreast to supply with crumbs; The dungeoned captive makes himself, of spiders, Things to protect and feed; the evil man, To expend his passion to influence, will torture; The good man blesses, at the same impulsion;— But to influence both require. TO A PERSONATION OF ARIEL AT THE THEATRE. Beautiful Croucher under old Prospero's power! Ever didst thou hold in sight that jubilee day, Whose gates should free thee into many a bower, Where boughs drop blossoms, and where wild bees stray; The alacrity with which thou didst obey Sprang from this very expectancy; and how well, Every expression of thy body did display This one vivid motive, might peradventure tell, Thy poet, the Ariel's God, the God of Prospero's cell. For was no fear on thine obedient brow; Nor pleasuring of the present; eagerly bright, With hope, and not with joy, did it avow Impatient anxiousness of coming delight; While still thy swift form fluttered for flight, Ever with glanced out head, and bended knees; A beautiful restlessness, an earth-bound sprite Listening its own heaven-music tinge the breeze, Noticing not earth's sands, heeding not earth's green trees. A thousand eyes did watch thy restless stay; A thousand ears heard thy fine wits retrieve Repeated promises of thy jubilee day; And as for some caged bird whose bonds aggrieve, They grieved for thee;—but when thou didst enweave Into thy song, “Do you love me, master? No!” Oh a thousand hearts did yearn for thy reprieve, For they felt thy heart with love could overflow, And that to expend that love thou didst desire to go. “Thing of the elements!” beautifully started Thy touching question; unconnectedly asked; Beauteously unconnect,—for when deep-hearted Have questionings long been, from the heart thus tasked, They will gush at any time, unbidden, unmasked; And thy sudden “Do you love me, master? No!” Told us, that though in cowslip's bell thou hadst basked,— Ever since thou hadst served the churlish Prospero, Thou hadst deeply longed that love betwixt ye twain might grow. If a new sound should music through the sky, How would all hearing drink the challenging tone; And when thou utteredst thy denying reply To this questioning of love, as Ariel alone Only could utter it, suddenly making known New voice, new human music;—then did burn Each listener, to divine, ere it were gone, What feelings toned it; though none might learn, How many, divine and deep, in that sweet “No” did yearn. And when old Prospero's farewell set thee free, Heavens! how we rose, as brake thy farewell singing Richly and strong, to hail thy beauteous glee; We saw thee bend, as though even homeward winging; We saw thine eyelids quiver beneath the springing Anew to thine heart, of the memory of thy life, Where the bee sucks, where summer sounds are ringing; Merrily, merrily abandoning, rose thy strain, And our hearts did sink with bliss e'en while thy flight did pain. LIFE. Oh! who said that life was a vanishing show! A cheat to humanity given! How could he be poet, when poets, we know, Can change even hell into heaven! Oh! how could he slander my beautiful world, So softly and brilliantly changing; Over each fading scene fairer hues are unfurled, So that fancy may ever go ranging. Oh lovely is the green green earth, With stars around her beaming: And glorious is a mortal's birth, For life is more than dreaming. He sighed that the blossoms of beauty and youth Should brighten the path to a tomb; Why did he forget that their goodness and truth, Would shine on and soften its gloom! Would shine on and soften? sweet minstrel!—no, rather Would change to a sweet quiet shade, That haven of rest where mortalities gather, Like babes, in a calm cradle laid! Oh lovely is the green green earth, With stars around her beaming; And glorious is a mortal's birth, For life is more than dreaming. THE MOURNER'S ISLE. The endless rains that gently fall In Carisbrook Castle Island, dear, Can soften the mourner's heart, and call From his burning brain the loosening tear; Then voyage with me to that wizard isle, There longest on earth will sad memories delay: Its sunshine is only a softly sad smile; And its flowers are too tender and brief to be gay. There will ne'er pain thee jest or joy; Its life is as still as its gliding streams; And the peasant you meet, and the peasant's boy, Wend there as if sadly remembering sweet dreams; There the herds are all pensive; the winds all are low; By starts the birds warble; each tree seems a pall; And there never despair robs the heart of its woe, To leave it accurst with cold hatred for all. When its sadness, its smiles, and its gentle rain, Shall have loosened thy tears, away I will flee; For I know that a friend is a bitter pain, When a love is gone to eternity: Oh! retreat to the isle! no more may I pray; The one who should move thee so, sister, is gone; But in that wizard isle, still his memory would stay; And unfound and unseen thou may'st weep there alone. SONG OF THE GOLD GETTERS. “The essence of trade is to buy cheap, and sell dear.”—House of Commons, England, 1843. Oh! truth may have suited the knights of old, And have royally crowned the barbarian's brow; And the Hottentot's mother his grave may have scrolled, With “He never once lied;” but Utopia now, In our civilized world, is the only land Where truth could be worshipped, where truth could live; For from statesman to tradesman, all utterance is planned, Any meanings but true ones to hint at or give. Lie! let us lie! make the lies fit; It's the only way mortals their fortunes can knit. If the minister orders war ships at a foe, He pretends they are bound quite a different way; And where is the man that shall dare to throw Disdain on the lie, or the truth to say; The traveller, hearing the lion's roar, Lies to the lion by feigning death, And lives by the lie; and what can there be more In the minister's lie to the enemy's teeth! Lie! let us lie! make the lies fit; It's the only way mortals their fortunes can knit. “The best policy's honesty,” horn-books tell, Though we know who lies best gets the best of the pelf;— 'Tis the sire for his children the axiom likes well, For the lie's an advantage he wants all himself; For the same cunning reason, your pulpits, your thrones, Your senates, your judges, the axiom repeat; Each wants to monopolise lying, and moans That he can't with this lie, truth from other men cheat. Lie! let us lie! make the lies fit; It's the only way mortals their fortunes can knit. Truth now starves in garrets, or rots in a gaol, Whate'er may have been in the times gone by; And supremacy national, “cakes and ale,” Honour, and station, reward the lie; Let us lie then like statesmen, like fathers, and gold We shall heap and keep;—the world is war And out of war's articles, none will uphold The virtue of truth when a falsehood gains more. (Chorus.) —Lie! let us lie! Oh! we'll make the lies fit; It's the only way mortals their fortunes can knit. EYEING THE EYES OF ONE'S MISTRESS. When down the crowded aisle, my wandering eyes 'Lighted on thine fixed scanningly on my face, They struck not passion fire, but in their place Did settlingly fix themselves, contemplative wise, Thine eyes to fathom;—for as one that lies On mountain side where thick leaved branches vein 'Twixt him and the sun, and gazes o'er the plain That wide beneath him variedly amplifies; I think my being was elevatedly lain On its own thought, and in thy being gazing With tranquil speculation, that did gain Singular delight: thus mine eyes thine appraising, By dial reckoning, only a moment spent; Whole ages, by the heart's right measurement. But when thine eyelids bent into thy gaze Nearing regard, and instigating light; Their lashes narrowing o'er the dewy blaze That suddenly thine eyes did appetite; Narrowing as if thou feared'st to invite Too utterly, but truly that their motion Caressingly closing faintly, might excite My tranquil gaze to passionate devotion;— Then, suddenly seemed I an infinite life; Infinitely falling down before thy shrine; Infinitely praying thy descent; the strife Of the aisle's crowd seemed gone; thine eyes and mine, Devouring distance, into each other grew; While thine unfeigning lids gloriously upward flew. REPOSE IN LOVE. I flew to thee, love, I flew to thee, love, From a world where all's deceit; The river rushing to the sea, love, Speeds not so wildly fleet: And now while bask'd beneath thine eyes, Where truth so calmly glows; Than the saint's first rest in Paradise, I know more sweet repose. In former times beside thee glowing, I've seen all life grow bright; Kindness o'er hardest faces flowing; O'er falsehood new truth-light: And then I thought it matchless bliss, To see the stars twice shine, All baseness from the earth to miss, Because I felt me thine. But now I know joy deeper far, Attends our love's career; It now no more veils life's vile war, But lifts me past life's sphere; And no joy may with this compare,— I see life's base design, Yet know no fear, no pain, no care, Because I feel me thine. SONG TO A ROSE. Beautiful rose! a song for thee, This shiny month of June; Thy red buds brighten every tree, And so my soul in tune, Would carol thy beauty, star of the wildwood! Image and joy of careless childhood! I strive to sing, but mine eyes grow dim, I fray thy leaves away, And the music sinks to a mournful hymn, For thy declining day; How shall I sing thee, star of the wildwood! Trembling and sad like advancing childhood! Slower the melody, slacker the string, Thine heart of hearts I have won; And the delicate hues of thine innermost ring, Are stripped, and stained, and—gone; How shall I sing thee, star of the wildwood! Ravished away like the joys of childhood! Silent the melody, broken the string,— Thy light is shed for ever,— Never more may the shower fresh fragrancy bring;— But the spirit would break to say “Never;” Fiercely I weep—star of the wildwood! Utterly lost like the joys of childhood! TO A CORPSE WATCHER. Earth hath no home for thee! whither wouldst thou! Fear'st thou the death-light damping its brow! Would'st thou gnash thy wild wrath at the world's life-smile! Or against the unknown blindly howl thy revile! Turn thee! turn thee! sit by its bed; With its hand in thy hand, learn the feel of the dead; Think how she yesternight danced down thy hall, Laughing out gentle light to each melody's call, Glancing thee girlhood's love, when her fine foot did fall In the arch feats of dance! Earth hath no home for thee! sit by its bed; And thy fury will sink, when thou feel'st it quite dead; For the shadows thou sawest, that rose in its face, When its mouth shuddered down into death's fixed grimace,— The shadows that rose in its face, and therefrom Came with a shudder,—more blackly shall come From that same white face in steady succession, And fill all the room with their soundless procession, Till thine eye-balls shall start from their swift retrogression, Darkening down from the roof. And the gloom of those shadows shall sink in thy brain, Expelling all thought, and deadening all pain; The tide in thy veins shall move heavy and slow, And the beats of thine heart long-intervalled go; To passionless torpor thy face shall wane, And omnipotent sleep shall thy life unstrain;— By the corpse thou shalt sleep,—by it thou shalt wake, But no glorious rage shall thy nature then shake, For low idiot tears will thy broken face slake, The tears of self-sorrow. Thou wilt weep; and when wept all thy greatness away, Thou shalt start from the corpse, and its grave-clothes array, And look with no love, but with horror, to its face, And say that a cold smell doth steam round its place, The cold smell of corruption;—thou'lt long for the day Of the quick busy world, with its work, and its play;— To that day then depart thou;—feel saved in its bloom, Hug thyself with the thought,—distant far is thy tomb,— Lose thyself in the gay crowds whose bright looks assume All that's most unlike death. But earth hath no home for thee!—far as thou strayest, Thy heart shall still sneer at all love that thou sayest, At all love that is said; for thou shalt believe, ever Love to be a false friend, even Death's frown can sever; And thus homeless, and hopeless of home, shalt thou mourn, With bitter life-hate, and gnawing self-scorn, The time when thou thoughtst that love could not fail so, The time when such thought from thy damn'd heart did go, That time when above thy slain love there did flow, Thy tears of self-sorrow. THE SUICIDE. Life is an island; and eternity's sea That girds it round, Rolleth for ever, vast and gloomily, With doubtful sound, Save when it stormeth up tempestuously, Lashing the ground. Voices are mingled with the rolling waters, Unearthly sweet; They fascinate the island sons and daughters, In bands to meet, And listen, heeding not the wrecks and slaughters, Rolled to their feet. Some walk before this sea with restless wings, Strong to dare The chilling mist its heavy rolling flings; With forehead bare, And flashing brow, resistless genius springs Undaunted there. A naked youth came bounding to its shore, Shouting out loud; But when he heard the interminable roar, His spirit bowed One moment, and the next it strove to soar Unchecked and proud. Upon his feet and shoulders wings were waving Widely and fast; Over the quiet country he was leaving, One look he cast Of contempt beautiful, and godlike craving; Sweet voices passed, Out from the sea, towards him richly ringing; He hails their tone; To explore the deep, the mighty child is winging; Oh! not alone; Concealed syrens toss there wildest singing, While golden spray is thrown. Rushing back came the youth with drooping plume; His strength was gone;— He stands again before the unthridden gloom, And still its moan, Wails to him burning melodies, that consume Him there alone. His frenzied eye read the eternal ocean; His pale lips gave Echoings to its inscrutable commotion; His speech did rave Language unknown; glancing sublime devotion He passed beneath the wave. OPINION'S CHANGE. The beardless statesman out at monarchy screams, “Down trampler by the heel on man's rights, down Foe to humanity's universal crown Because it overdazzles thy false crown's beams;”— Thoughtless of human needs, he ever dreams Of human “rights;”—those “rights” being just alone The singular needs peculiarly his own,— Such needs as power to test one's own law-schemes: But learned to think, he sees that men, in a king, Find much they need,—a thing, to which must bow Masters, as low as serfs; a man, whose brow Is highest in the state, and yet must spring Smiles to their smiles;—and so he lets enjoy Mankind its many kings, as a child its toy. A CRISIS. If when the day was fine, the summer high, Encentred in this meadow, one revolved Inquiring gaze, around it he would see Fencing it, wooden palings, mossy, and mellowed To gentle kinds of undecided colour, By rain and age; then close behind the fence, All round it rising high, would stop his sight, An impassable verdure of commingled trees, Offering the eye a thousand fathomless nooks Filled with green dark, but nowhere tunnell'd through By any passage; 'midst the dark green mass Would puzzle him fluttering motionings and sounds, —As unassignable as an ant-hill's stir,— Of wild-wood denizens; while frequently, Might song-bird, soundlessly from one of its shades Flit o'er the meadow, and, with closing wings, Into shade opposite glide; but from its top His eye would only lift to a roof of sky. Within this meadow did no tame thing browse; Wild were the hares that cantered through its ferns; Wild were the hawks that wheeled 'twixt it and heaven; Its bees were wild bees of some cavernous tree; None plucked its flowers; no menial o'er it trod; It had been the battle-field, the unsculptured grave, Of Christian martyrs; and its reverent lord Ordained it sacred. The evening church-chimes had dispersed the mowers From all the fields of toil; the evening sun Slanted his golden light, as he did lapse Towards underneath the earth; his light was rayed So gorgeously upon this sacred meadow, Its yellow buttercups, its ruby sorrels, Its milk-white clover, and its cool green grass, Seemed blended into one rich coloured woof, Changing in hue, as waved beneath the breeze;— When leaned therewithin, against its fence, A form white robed, which the whelming sunshine Showed to be fullest symmetry of woman, Swelling through girlhood's prime. Fronting the mead She stood; against the fence her shoulders rest; Above it gently her head and neck bend back; Her long brown hair behind her straightly fallen, Leaves unconcealed her twin-breasted bosom, Thus raised against her vest; her pertinent feet, Pressingly side by side, are forwarded Into the mead, and planted firmly there; And from her planted feet, to her fallen back head, One proud full arch she arches. A large wind Came o'er the mead, and flaggingly on her fell, Weighing her vestments downwards and around; Smoother than apples shone her round young knees; Showed beauteously together bridged, her limbs; The frontage of her body broadly orbed; The sunlight whelmed all:—loosely her head, Loosely her neck falls backward; her round chin, And its rich blood-red lip, now languidly sink Down from the upwardly curved lip above; While round the corners of her idling mouth, Slow smiling dimples, when her basking eyes, A little uplifting their nigh-closed lids, Thrill with voluptuous light,—above her cheeks Like fringed crevices to measureless splendour. Rounds she out thus on firmly planted feet, Her enjoying form, and thus her face is naked In glowing rapture,—because by her stands, Lovingly gazing on her, he whose gaze Pours dizzying pleasure over her, to permeate, Till her shoulders shiver and shrink with her delight. Feelings, as things, do grow; and growing, change: The love that bended forth this gazer's face, Fixing its slightest muscle, and its eyes Firing to their very depths, had grown and changed. When first he loved, had risen in him one lusting Towards her, he had spat into his heart Intense self-loathing; what was then his love, Words may not scribe, his memory could not seize, Fancy may compass not; therewith was nought Of jealousy, or desire, or doubt, or pain; Nought of self-love, self-consciousness; it joined With marvellous adoration, perfectest rest, Instinctive trust, and measureless devotion, And measureless sympathy, but it was not these. Such in this meadow, by her arched out form, Was it not now, for it had grown and changed. 'Twas love! but now every atom of his body, Trembleth for every atom moulding her's; 'Twas love! but now he could strangle her from life, Rather than see another bridegroom her; Oh! yes, 'twas love! for in life's flintiest highways, He would rush to grovel his being's nakedest bosom, To gain her smile, or cause her one delight. Yea, still he loved her, utterly; through the world Drifting unknown and knowing not; his mind, A mirror multiplying a thousand times Her lonely loveliness,—ever there he gazed, Still, still she shone; his will, a trembling rudder, She held to play with, or to queen; his body, Their mutual serf, its separated being, Never once recognized by any of his thoughts. Yet, never had he spoken to her the love, Making thus his being with its countless powers, Her magnificently swift automaton; To measureless action springed by her in a moment, To measureless rest subdued. She saw it, loved it, Dreamed her world out of it, and yet he feared She knew it not, and knowing, would disapprove. Now therefore here, into this sacred meadow, To try her hath he come; to daringly burst Into the secretest chambers of her soul, Its unveiled moods to see: the talisman, That shall rend away the garments of her being, All pitilessly nakeding her, he bears; He approaches her, he trembles, pales his face, He would see, yet fears to see. But even now, In fond coquetry, or affectionate joy, She lifts her head; against the tree behind, She plants its crown; her feet move slightly back; Up outwardly she boldly lifts her form; Like a ship sail, wind-curved from the mast, She roundeth out. Where now is his intent? Thrice his knees bend unconsciously, and thrice His hand descends towards her lifted heels, Quivering to fill its hollow with their round. The struggling eyes of his fire-beflooded face, Devour the unshod archings of her feet, As he imagineth his caressing mouth There trampled; yet around her arching loins, His arm he girds not, but with great control Apart he stands. Now suddenly her eyes Turned round to his, their startled lids, once fluttering, Could not close down, and thus transfixed, she took Awhile his rifling glances,—till he moved, When swift she snatched her eyes back, turning pale. Soon they both feigned indifference; and spake, Of the meadow sleeping goldenly before,— The trees around,—the richly slanting sunlight; But as they spake, relapsed with gradual lapse, Her heels to ground, her shoulders to the fence: No longer curved she out as a sail wind-filled, For her exquisitely supple body revolved in Over its ample throne; and negligently Her feet slid out their length into the mead; And to her bosom, with low drooping lids, Her face declined; and down from her propped shoulders, Her arms fell straightly; and her straightened limbs, Loosened down all her form; and thus towards him, She sloped; in virgin innocence unknowing His fiery mood, or even the love thus loosening All her own make. He gasped, his mouth did strive 'Neath suffocation;—for beneath her eyes, A dimly flushing sultriness did increase, And her lips out-sulk'd such a complaining sulk, As though possessed all conqueringly by desire, And faintingly requiring love's moist balm. He stood like one shot through with fixing pain; Recovering his purpose, with a cry, He tore the talisman from his breast, and threw it Towards her feet, and leapt into the wood. Watching him swiftly stagger through the trees, She reached the talisman; it was a page Scribed with his words, and kneeling she did read: Her eyes seemed straining down a vast abysm, For some winged car to save; her lips apart, Her shoulders lifted, and her fingers clenched,— Showed how she strove with hope, while read she there, “Oh! beautiful girl, but one could love thee so! When yestermorn sent thee stepping o'er the mead, The thought of being adopt thine universe steed, Doubled his life;—thine universe steed, to go, And against, and through each fiercely phalanxed foe, Bear thee all glorious; in his heart, bliss-fire, That his broad frontage would itself attire, With every wound aimed towards thine overthrow: And oh! a thousand deaths seemed less than nought, Would'st thou but ride him through life's fiery storm; Burthening him fondly, thine affectionate form, Whenever might peace be found, or melody caught; When danger neared, relinquishing proud all rein; When past, all fondly burthening him again. But his will reins his heart; and thereby, reined That heart is from the slightest start to love Thee, who perchance its love might disapprove; For every love-plaint uninvitedly plained, Fouls; yea, woman's purity is arraigned, When man thrusts towards her love display, love claim, She prompts not, cherishes not: what woman's shame? But witnessing love she loves not, uncurtained:— Then beautiful girl! though one could love thee so; His passions in tumultuous armies, waiting Worshippingly to convoy thee down time; He wills not love; exultingly shall go His passions past thee, loudly jubilating Towards life's fit ways, so crowdedly sublime.” The going radiance of the sinking sun Was from the crimson sorrel yet undrawn, When back returned this chieftain of his passions, King of his heart: as loitering, he came; Striving to twist his face into the forms Of cold keen observation, such as make With angular lines, the countenances of those Who scan phenomena. She still did kneel, Her face bewildered white, and hued with pain. One look she looked to him,—its prompting feelings, Women perchance may know; reproach was there, Sadness was there,—yea, in its large fixed eyes, A questioning sadness that could make one's throat Convulse with pity; yet through all did rule The deepest tenderness;— “A lie! a lie! It was all lie!” he cried; and at her feet, His face abased; “your foot was on my neck; Had you withdrawn from me your trusting eyes, Opening their avenues to some other gazer;— Oh God! the imagining of the horror, makes The flesh to slide from my detested frame.— I am calm; my mind lifts up above my life, I see it sovereignly; this life of mine, As it did tide beneath you, I will bare; Look you, and see how gloriously I lied. I think,—but that through which I have been passed, Hath shaken the memory of earlier things;— I think, that ere we met, life was to me, As to most men, a whirl of beauteous mirage, I still in vain pursued; or sadly stood, Mocking its hollowness; the ponderous curse Of unpursuit, weighing deadeningly in my brain. I know that when we met, did all things change: I nought pursued, yet passiveness was pleasure, Being was bliss; from all the outward things, That make the total which mankind call life, I was abstract; or only then related, When they did influence as subservient bonds To bind us twain;—the sunshine, I did know, Because that when its warmth relaxed my limbs, I saw your arms fall also; and the sea, I knew, because that when it awed my soul, I saw your countenance gaze mysterious fear. I had content; my blood did pleasantly flow; Breathing was rest:—yet action that you urged, From the moment when my being prepared to act, Till the moment that accomplished your will, Was a delirious ecstacy;—the greater, The greater the action that you did command. And if 'twas bliss to be by you, and bliss To act your will,—oh! what, the crushing torture! To see another man look o'er your brow, As he were fancying how divine his life, Were it thus swayed by yours; to see another Acquire your will, and with a happy smile, Move for its service. Other things now are come, I know not whether to endure or curse. Desire of you doth change my blood; it burns; My veins start stiff, they tighten through my body, They strangle me. Oh girl! what destiny is there, That I am stricken thus! I gaze against you; My baffled eyes see nought but murderous beauty; Your sound is beauty; beauty are your robes; I dare not see your form beneath them move; And yet I see, and tremble, and die down. “Oh why is this?” he moaned through sobs, and rolled His body o'er the ground, “where is the peace, The aforetime peace with which I blessingly loved you, The rapture men call pure.” Two lips did press upon his fiery brow; They pressed, they stayed, they lingeringly withdrew; He felt whole ages rolling o'er his life; Obliteratingly, ages rolled away, While those two lips his brow did apprehend Gently to press themselves apart, and then, Gently to close again; no word she said; Not otherwise she touched him; he did never Rise up his face to look; but blindly wound His arms around her sides, and to her bosom, Moved his still downcast head, till there it dropt In signless passiveness. Anon they rose, Both pale as alabaster: summoning, With a heavy sigh, and compressure of her lips, The needful force;—her hand enclasp'd his arm, Holding him opposite her, and with voice, That came by syllables, distinct, she said,— “I know not what men mean when name they love; I have not dreamed of life from you apart; Since many months, I have not thought to hide Aught that I feel, from you; it gave me joy, When we have sympathized; I never saw Aught in you that offended me; I would Dare aught to make you happy or more good.” Thus all is over; her concluding words, Were smothered in his bosom; for his arms Had bound her to him, and her head had fallen there. The storm of feeling sank in both their beings, To the joy of rest; upon the bank they sate; Over her shoulder lay his sinking face; Over his shoulder hers; no words they spake, No fast enlacements made they; very softly, And very timidly, close in her ear, At last he whispered “This is as I felt, Those days I did lament, when peace was mine, And love that men call pure;” then gradually Their faces they did lift; and open-eyed, They looked unto each other, a look all free From every questioning, or want, or aught But love unutterable:—a look that never, Never, never, may either look again; for night Brought with its darkness, when the maiden's face Was dusked over, to the young man's blood, His wild desire; and they went not thence Till there had passed that sacrifice thereto, After which never again may exist the feelings That holiest look did utter, and which makes The life thus spoiled, one long, long funeral, With never a single mourner;—'twas a look Painter hath never limned, nor poet sung, Nor dreamer visioned; and could poet sound Words, that should give the minds of those who heard, Knowledge of its prompting feelings, he would fling Art to the winds, thought, life, and heaven, forget,— And though the uttering the words should shatter Him to annihilation, he would speak, And shatter himself into eternal fame. THE RAILROAD. Why! why to yon arch do the people drift; Like a sea hurrying in to a cavern's rift; Or like streams to a whirlpool streaming swift? 'Tis the railroad! Each street and each causeway endeth there; And the whole of their peoples may step one stair Down from the arch, and a power shall bear Them swifter than wind from the mighty lair; 'Tis the railroad! Pass through the arch; put your ear to the ground! This road sweepeth on through the isle, and around! You touch that which touches the country's bound! 'Tis the railroad! Like arrowy lightning snatched from the sky, And bound to the earth, the bright rails lie; And their way is straight driven through mountains high, And headland to headland o'er vallies they tie; 'Tis the railroad! See how the engine hums still on the rails; While his long train of cars slowly down to him sails; He staggers like a brain blooded high, and he wails; 'Tis the railroad! His irons take the cars, and screaming he goes; Now may heaven warn before him all friends and all foes; A whole city's missives within him repose; Half a thousand miles his, ere the day's hours close; 'Tis the railroad! A PRAYER TO A FICKLE MISTRESS. From the depth of my gloom, to your beauty I come; But my gaze may not brighten, as erst, at its glow: Nor kneel may I to you all gloriously low, Nor feel your dear hand o'er my brow softly go; I know that you would that even now I sank dumb; Lelia! once say you are sad for me. You would shrink, but to me, when mine eyes love did fight; When this arm clasp'd you round, 'midst your ravishing hair, On this bosom lolled your head, while unhidingly there, Your face turned to mine with such restful repair; God! then how I dived in your eyes' surging light! Lelia! once say you are sad for me. Never God sent the night, but I saw on my couch, Your cheek's beautiful sleep, that I guarded supreme; Alone would I gaze, till your soft lips would seem There stirr'd by the mild light that round them did gleam;— Behind that chamber's madness horror-stricken I crouch! Lelia! once say you are sad for me. None could pity, I am hopeless! I loved you to shame; Mine honour had been gone for one promising smile; When your soft hair fell cool o'er my burning face, while My brain swooned with delight 'neath its curls;— any guile To be bless'd with thy bidding, had become my wild aim; Lelia! once say you are sad for me. Your lover is coming; I hear his wild vow! For ever we are parting; oh! in mercy, refrain From that acted surprise; I nor plead, nor complain; Oh! yet say, when we loved, that thou didst not all feign, And I'll bless thee, and pray for thee as to thee now; Lelia! once say you are sad for me. A PAGAN'S DRINKING CHAUNT. Like the bright white arm of a young god, thrown To the hem of a struggling maiden's gown; The torrent leaps on the kegs of stone, That held this wine in the dark gulf down; Deep five fathoms it lay in the cold; The afternoon summer heats heavily weigh; This wine is awaiting in flagons of gold, On the side of the hill that looks over the bay. There, a bower of vines for each one bends, Under the terracing cedar trees; Where, shut from the presence of foes or friends, He may quaff and couch in lonely ease; The sunshine slants past the dark green cave; In the sunshine, the galleys before him will drowse; And the roar of the town, like a far-travelled wave, Will faintly flow in to his calm carouse. No restless womanhood frets the bower, Exacting, and fawning, and vain, and shy; But a beautiful boy shall attend the hour, And silently low in the entrance lie; As he silently reads the scrolls that tell, The Cyprian's loves, and the maiden's dreams, His limbs will twine, and his lips will swell, And his eyes dilate with amorous schemes. And his yearning limbs, and his sultry mouth, Will recall to the drinker his own youth's prime; When there seemed crowding round him from east, west, and south, Countless sleek limbs of women with capturing mime; And he'll mourn for youth; and he'll deem more dear This cool bright wine;—to our bowers, away! And nothing will witness the sigh, or the tear, On the side of the hill that looks over the bay. A CHRISTIAN'S DRINKING CHAUNT. Oh! the world is a place where the happiest of things Is to blind one's eyes to the cruel guile, That lurks with a thousand ready stings Often under the beautiful smile; And the finest of magics to dim the sight, Is the wine, the wine, the wine we pour! Then drink! and dream that the world goes right; Oh drink! and dream that we'll doubt no more. They tell us the silliest of things is to trust, If it be not yet sillier, distrust to show; We give to them back, that trust we must, For it is the most beautiful pleasure we know; Let them nickname it folly, and sober, depart;— The wine, the wine, the wine we pour! That glorious young folly shall rouse in each heart, To make ancient music, and fling wide the door. The wine cups are foaming, our brows shine delight; The world raves behind us; arise we, arise! Drink deep our contempt for each low-hearted wight, Who prefers sober sneers to our love-bedimmed eyes! Again, fill again, all together, drink again, To this wine, this wine, this wine we pour! It rolls to our lips, and it woos us to drain; And we kiss as we drink, and each kiss yearns for more. The sober ones say, when this wine-dream has passed, We shall each doubt the other, be deceived, and deceive; Is it so!—then exhaust we our joys while they last, And wring from the hour what weeks can't retrieve: Sober life comes amain with its cares and gloom; But the wine, the wine, the wine we pour! Now is ours! and defying the worst that can come, Over time and fate conquering, drink, drink to the core! DISMOUNTING A MISTRESS. I touched her lily hand! Earth! bound away!— I' the stirrup did she stand; Her glorious foot I spann'd, As she stepped to the land!— Where is the day! Where go ye, brother-men! Nought the same did stay!— I went; I turned agen; She kissed down the glen, Her fingers to me then!— Earth! bound away! RAIN. More than the wind, more than the snow, More than the sunshine, I love rain; Whether it droppeth soft and low, Whether it rusheth amain. Dark as the night, it spreadeth its wings, Slow and silently up on the hills; Then sweeps o'er the vale, like a steed that springs From the grasp of a thousand wills. Swift sweeps under heaven the raven cloud's flight; And the land, and the lakes, and the main, Lie belted beneath with steel-bright light, The light of the swift rushing rain. On evenings of summer, when sunlight is low, Soft the rain falls from opal-hued skies; And the flowers the most delicate summer can show, Are not stirred by its gentle surprize. It falls on the pools, and no wrinkling it makes, But touching, melts in, like the smile That sinks in the face of a dreamer, but breaks Not the calm of his dream's happy wile. The grass rises up as it falls on the meads; The bird softlier sings in his bower; And the circles of gnats circle on like winged seeds, Through the soft sunny lines of the shower. THE FACE. These dreary hours of hopeless gloom, Are all of life I fain would know; I would but feel my life consume, While bring they back mine ancient woe; For midst the clouds of grief and shame They crowd around, one face I see; It is the face I dare not name; The face none ever name to me. I saw it first, when in the dance Borne, like a falcon, down the hall, He stayed to cure some rude mischance My girlish deeds had caused to fall; He smiled, he danced with me, he made A thousand ways to soothe my pain; And sleeplessly all night I prayed That I might see that smile again. I saw it next, a thousand times; And every time its kind smile neared; Oh! twice ten thousand glorious chimes My heart rang out, when he appeared; What was I then, that others' thought Could alter so my thought of him! That I could be by others taught His image from my heart to dim! I saw it last, when black, and white, Shadows went struggling o'er it wild; When he regained my long lost sight, And I with cold obeisance smiled;— I did not see it fade from life; My letters o'er his heart they found; They told me in death's last hard strife, His dying hands around them wound. Although my scorn that face did maim, Even when its love would not depart; Although my laughter smote its shame, And drave it swording through his heart; Although its death-gloom grasps my brain With crushing unrefused despair;— That I may dream that face again, God still must find alone my prayer. WHIMPER OF AWAKENING PASSION. Your hands were a tent for mine eyes, As low in your lap I was lain; And I thought as I gazed at my skies, I will never know other again. You sang, and your voice through me waved Such rapture, I heard myself say, “Oh here is the heaven I have craved, Never hence will I wander astray.” As I lay in your lap, your limbs gave Such beautiful smooth rest to me, I told you that thus to be slave, I would never consent to be free. But now mine eyes under their tent, Think such distance from yours, love! is wrong; And my mouth wants your mouth to be sent Down to him, all undrest, love! of song. Oh, I fear, if your beautiful limbs Still to have me their slave, feel inclined; You must either prevent all these whims, Or a way, love! to humour them, find. A LADY'S HAND. It is the same bright fairy dress That robes thy beauteous form; And with the same unstartled grace Thou gazest o'er the storm; The same mysterious hour, Now girdles round us twain; Lay then, in this same bower, Thy hand on me again. Thy hand on me, again, lady! All man's world sleepeth still; And God hath given the rein, lady! To his world's passionate will;— See how the lightnings leap, lady! Over the rocks, and the main; Oh! lay, while all men sleep, lady! Thy hand on me again. The storm around us rife, Befits the storm that then Will rise amidst my life, With the same wild joy as when, At this same midnight hour, When thus raged heaven and main, In this same secret bower, Thy hand did not refrain. On me again that hand! lady! Nearer the thunder peals; The chains on my heart disband, lady! Now, now while nature reels, While sleeps all life like the grave, lady! But ours, and the hurricane,— While now thou mayst yet save, lady! Thy hand on me again! THE POET'S DEATH. Now the Poet's death was certain, and the leech had left the room; Only those who fondly loved him, waited to receive the doom; And the sister he loved best, whiter than hemlock did veer; And she bent, and “life is going” faintly whispered in his ear. Though her fingers clasped his fingers, though her cheek by his did lay; Though she whispered “I am dying; with thee, death hath no dismay;” Fiercely sprang the startled Poet, and his eye did fight through space; While dark agony did thicken his drawn lips, and wrench his face. Sister arms did wind around him, knelt his sire beside the bed; And his mother busied round him, love extinguishing her dread; But the Poet heeded nothing, fixing still his fighting eye, Gathering, gathering, gathering inward, that he was that hour to die. Now the sound of smothered sobbings smote upon his distant mind, And he turned a glance around him, that each gazer's love divined; The torture in his face did stagger once before his mother's look; Then came back more whiteningly, while his neck did downward crook. From his crook'd down neck, his visage struggled love back through its pain, First to one, and then to another, and then left them all again; As the sister wept against him, shudderingly to her he turned; And his lips did open at her, and his eyes for language yearned. Quick at her his lips did open, strivingly his eyelids rose, But no sound, no word, no murmur, their fast gesturings did disclose; Straightly pointed he his arm then, where his poetdesk was lain; To his grasp the sister brought it, while the stillness throbbed amain. From his desk the Poet tore the unformed scriptures of his soul; And to them he fiercely pointed, while his eyes large tears did roll; “Perfected, my memory earth to endless time would love and bless; I must die, and these will live not!” through his lips at last did press. Whiter grew the gazing faces, as the cliffs that sunshine smites, When they found no aid could come from earthly loves, or priestly rites; O'er his scriptures he fell forward, and they all did trust and say, That the last wild pang was on him, for as still as stone he lay. But than lightning's flash more sudden, he did spurn the abhorred bed; And a moment he stood tottering, tossed defyingly his head; Ere one reached him, he was fallen, lifeless, and his wide dulled eye Rigid with the fierce defiance that had just refused to die. To the gloomy troop of Atheists, gibberingly the sister ran; While the praying father kneeling, hurled at her his pious ban; In the churchyard lies the Poet, and his scent the air depraves; And ten thousand thousand like him, stuff the earth with such like graves. A COMING CRY. The few to whom popes' kings have given the earth God gives to all, Do tell us that for them alone its fruits increase and fall; They tell us, that by labour, we may earn our daily bread; But they take the labour for their engines that work on unfed; And so we starve; and now the few have published a decree,— Strave on, or eat in workhouses, the crumbs of charity; Perhaps it's better than starvation,—once we'll pray, and then, We'll all go building workhouses, million, million men! We'll all go building workhouses,—million, million hands, So jointed wondrously by God, to work love's wise commands; We'll all go building workhouses,—million, million minds, By great God chartered to condemn whatever harms or binds; The God-given mind shall image, the God-given hand shall build The prisons for God's children by the earth-lords willed; Perhaps it's better than starvation, once we'll pray, and then, We'll all go building workhouses,—million, million men. What'll we do with the workhouses? million, million men! Shall we all lie down, and madden, each in his lonely den? What! we whose sires made Cressy! we, men of Nelson's mould! We, of the Russel's country,—God's Englishmen the bold! Will we, at earth's lords' bidding, build ourselves dishonoured graves? Will we who've made this England, endure to be its slaves? Thrones totter before the answer!—once we'll pray, and then, We'll all go building workhouses,—million, million men. A PLEA FOR LOVE OF THE INDIVIDUAL. It were to live not! Lady! cease thy pleading, “Love not, love not,”—words indeed “vainly spoken;” The heart will love, even when torn and bleeding, Yea, love that very one by whom 'tis broken: Oh love then! love! Love! love! though it be true the loved may change! For thine agony in his alien caressing Will sink to a sad calm, and cannot estrange Thy power to love him still with measureless blessing: Oh love then! love! Yea, even then loving, when pales with fear his brow, At his own inconstancy,—thou shalt awaken To a wild sweet bliss in striving more to endow With beauty and truth the one for whom thou wert forsaken: Oh love then! love! Love! love! albeit the loved may die,—yet love! Canst not thou die! the loving grave-descender Burns with a rapturous joy that never may move The unloving wanderer down whole lives of splendour: Oh love then! love! Though one brief love-hour may order years of sorrow, Love! love! for that one hour will make thee know, How, long as earth rolls round from morn tomorrow, Will its myriad peoples pant with love's wild glow: Oh love then! love! Yea! for this knowledge even from oblivion's tomb Banishes disgust; who, who disdains to end, Knowing the love-bliss, that while life shall bloom, Over his grave shall deepeningly expend. Oh love then! love! PLEA FOR LOVE OF THE UNIVERSAL. Nay, minstrel! love! and all things round thee moving, Shall utter heavenly music, smile thee light; For mighty is the loveliness of loving, To endue the loved with joy; and joy makes bright; Oh love then! love! Love magnifies existence; love the world,— Thy soul shall grow world-great in its sensation; And 'neath the blaze of infinite life unfurled, Pant with the passion of a whole creation. Oh love then! love! For thine own heart's sake, love! the unloving mind, Unemanating light, no light receiveth; Tomb of itself, unable rest to find, Buried alive, it low and wildly grieveth. Oh love then! love! Why sayest thou “Love not, for the loved may die!” Reasoning inadequate!—because trees wither, Do suns cease shining! though one loved thing fly, Sends it not others love desiring hither! Oh love then! love! And thy warning “Love not, for the loved may change,” Discrediteth love, that never a fee requires; Happy in loving, though all, all be strange, Its flame still burns, itself feeds still its fires: Oh love then! love! Love is that act, which maketh rich in giving; Passion of soul which wasteth not, nor paineth; Battled for, prayed for, wept for, by all living; Dwelling most in him, who most of happiness gaineth: Oh love then! love! WAYS OF REGARD. Sharks' jaws are glittering through the eternal ocean Now, even as ever; through its topmost seas That mightily billow, through the secrecy Of its abysms, where the waters bide Omnipotently shuddering,—scattering fear, Onward they go; their illuminating teeth, Perpetually parting; and ever through Some dolphin's body, nervously they clench. Hidden within the tropic forest's maze, Now, even as ever, glares the tiger's eye Over its victim, yellow circling light: And there, the serpent, with his gaze, still charms To approach, and into his distended jaws Shiveringly hie, the gaudy chattering parrot, Or gambolling coney: and shaggy spiders there, Catch in their webs the flitting humming birds: And through the golden air, the humming birds flitting, Slay countless happy insects. Slaughter sways Supremely everywhere: where man comes not, Beasts kill each other; where his empire holds, There, oh ye gods! on richer aliment, Feeds slaughter, and extends. There, armies clash; And in the shock, ten thousand human forms, Each with all exquisite joints, and countless nerves, Fall bloodily broken. There, the priest-piled faggots, Flame round the martyr, and send up to heaven The smoke of torment. There, the blood-stained hands Of gold-holders sell sustenance to the goldless, At price of body, at price of mind and heart. There, the goldless pay this price; and breed successors; A generation of things that never live, But toil, and suffer, and shriek,—undead abortions, That yet are human children! And self-slain, Often humanity. Man's towns and cities, Seem builded on rivers, that the rushing waters May roll for him the ever ready tomb, He oft assumes; and self-slain, ever go down Fond women, who the cup of life still spill, Offering it tremblingly to some gallant's lips. Dire is the woe, when first the vision of slaughter Thus everywhere regnant, breaks into the mind Youthful and loving, and emerging from the home Where all it knew, was, that all round it smiled; And whence ever went its fancies, towards some fate That should one day lead it through the maze of life, To seek and share love everywhere. At first, Stunned like a wader out into the sea, Who thinking he steps upon the sand, finds only Water yield under him,—the appalled youth, Withouten speech or thought, instinctively, Reaches out aimlessly and in vain for aid. Then the howl of the world arouses him; he rises,— Through heavens and hells, eternities and times, Wildly he stares;—seeking the power that bids This terrible reign. Baffled, his gaze retreats; He strips his being of all control and veil, With which men gird themselves; and he thinks his teeth Could grasp Earth's wretched breast, and that he could leap With her to oblivion. And while thus he dreams, Steals sensual pleasure to him. The nakedness, To which in his noble rage he smote his being, But exposes him to her dalliance; and he turns, From thought, that bids him hurl against the unknown, His life, that itself dishonours, in enduring Sight of the blood-stained universe,—to the arms Of sensual pleasure, and exhausted there, Finds ignominious sleep:— If sleep that be, whereunto ever descend The visions of possible and gentle glory, That circled brightly round his youth, and that now Invite him, from his impotent degradation, To soar unto their joy;—if sleep that be, From which the sleeper must ever rise, and slay, With a murder worse than parricide, these entreaters;— Or awake, to find his moral powers gone idiot, And his intellect sane to watch them. But many there are who know the scheme of life, A plan for battle and murder, yet undergo Nor fear, nor rage. With energy, they strain Life's murderous principle to their use to curb. Earth, bleeding, drags her chain; but a car thereto These ones do fasten; and therein they sit, In their happiness, and their pride, all sumptuously. Also are those, whose minds will never take A world-wide vision; and who mete life's merits, By their own present circumstance. When shines, Full on their skins, the sun,—this life they call A beautiful home; and when they suffer one Of the world's evils,—maundering for death, The self-same life they cry a torture-house. These pester, with charge of morbidness and disease, Those of their brethren, in whose world-wide hearts, Earth's misery ever sticks, a poisoning knife. And beings unhuman are there, who regard This universal slaughter, never as man. The general mind knows only things that impinge Its palpable senses;—otherwise, haughty steps, Of men who tread with appropriating feet Earth and its causeways; and of beauteous women, Who walk our pavements, and our terraces, And our swung bridges, as though hoveringly Their scornful feet the fitness questioned Of every spot they press,—would drop to the shuffle Of slaves and tools. Yea! had man the vision That sees all being, he would scamble on, Athwart his fields, and his hills, and through all his streets, With the abased hurry of one, who moves A petty unit in a round of motion, By other intelligences curiously scanned, And for their study begotten. Yea! would he Pause in his being, and question whether to end. He would check the lion-like passions, which him prompt To complete the sovereignty of slaughter; and ask Whether, like wild beasts for the Roman's sport, His groups should tear themselves, that unhuman powers May study the unity which through creation Most orderly dwells. One saw,—commanding time, And extinguishing space, and past the farthest reach Of the five senses reaching,—he beheld, Within this earth, when night was dark, a cavern, Peopled with slaves contemplating revolt. Under the light of many a lurid fire That burned on upper ledges of the rock, The countless slaves stood noiselessly; the light Fell on the mass, as eagerly it upheld Its faces to the chief, who on a ledge Above them stood. In tumult, lifted it Its withered countenances, skinny jaws, Wild eyes, and knotted brows, and bloodless lips. One after the other rose the faces, till They settled there, one pale dark stare of pain. Passing the crowded slaves, towards the chief, There rushed a woman; with the gasping utterance Of fear, she shrieked unto the chief, “Your daughter! Your daughter has been ravished! In the grove, She rushed by where I stood, and after her The lord, your master. Furiously obscene Were his wild oaths. I followed him; I saw Him snatch her from the precipice she had climbed; He took her in his arms; he laid him down Beside her senseless form; I knelt to him; And by his mother's fame, his sister's honour, By his own manhood, by her helplessness,— Prayed him for pity on her chastity. He spat in her face, and laughed; I snatched his knife, And should have slain him; but he wrested it, Pinioned my arms, and to the nearest tree Bound me. Her screaming shuddered on my cheek: The wind swept, but it waved no death-sword! The stars shone, but afar, and placidly! Clouds hurried through the air, but no avenger Burst from their gloom! the hill, the poisoned hill, Stirred not! I heard his oaths, his laughs, his blows, Sound out in the clear night. I could not stir; My impotence was crime; one terrible shriek Struck my heart void. Oh! nothing more I know.” The mechanism of the chieftain's frame Shook for a moment, while this tale began; Then evidenced not emotion, save by palor, That through his frame did deepen,—the same palor As that within the murdered victim's face, At the last blow of many. When the silence Throbbed through the cavern, he arose, and cried, “Why tell you, that your sister, and my child, Struck from the pedestal of maidenhood To the cold ditch of harlotry, outcrieth Her pain, her terror; that the coming hours Still bring the fiend who dashed her; that unhindered He aye repeats his brutal ravishment! That presently, tired of his victim, he, From utter hatred of her chaster nature, Will thrust her o'er to indiscriminate rape! Make her sweet form the sink of filthiness! Yea, for the merriment of his gazing comrades, Force her to crimes unnatural, too monstrous For words to image! I insult the maiden, Proclaiming thus her wrongs, for you abet them! She shrieks to us for aid; your lying eyes Smile to her ravisher!—Do thou, God! hear me! Hear, God! Not even my child herself supposeth The blackness low impending o'er her life. She will not keep her virtues; she must change; The filth perpetually assailing her, Must alter her! 'Tis not in human nature, Endless repulsion. O that she could know; For then her life would shudder out at once;— Know that the very horrors she now hates, She shall lust after;—that her soul shall suit Its nature to its circumstance, until Its wings shall rotten off, its plumage drop,— Till it become a naked leprous remnant To whom death dares not open paradise. Hear, God! this daughter of thine own, shall start, And fight against herself, and doubt her being; She shall begin to fear that she may change; She shall think that she may change; her thought will grow Into belief;—then ever, ever, ever, The spectre of her future self shall haunt her; She dares not hate it, yet she must, she does; Like to a serpent-fascinated bird, She loathes yet runs to it. Oh! worse than every other agony, Thou keenest consciousness of vilest crime, — This struggling amidst darkness of the soul; — This giving o'er the struggle, when all palsied, She first perceives that irredeemably, She is changing to the foulness she abhors: Her wild doom, like a vast upstanding sea, Unnatural, overhangs! Slaves! Brothers! are we Already thus cursed! Damned are we to endurance, To acquiescence, to contentment! Oh! not so! The habit of obedience hath not slain ye! Arise! shake out the fetters from your souls, And they will leave your limbs! All is not lost. Hear me, Oh hear me! We no more are slaves;— Have we not hearts like men; do we not feel The voice of kindness;—contemplate with pleasure, The joys of life; are not our senses human; Own we no love; can we not love return. Oh! being men, they who would hold you slaves, Do murder you alive! They blind your minds With writhing toil, and say you have no sight; They break you from the majesty of man, Into gaunt monsters, crooked miseries, And call you brute-like,—trample down your hearts, And say you have none,—banish from your souls The light of knowledge, and proclaim you soulless,— Rend you from God, saying you are not men:— But that we are, witness this hungering dagger, Which through his troops of hireling cut-throats, And through his massive towers, and through his silks Shall reach my daughter's ravisher's heart, and stab Right through its damned core, there thundering, The man, your slave! Aha! have you no daughters? Where are your wives? your sweethearts? Spitten upon! Beaten in the face while ravished! Ha! you start! Prove, prove that you are men! Revenge! Revenge!— They bade us feed on grass—we will grow drunk With their red blood; they trample us as snakes— We will rise dragon-like, and with our fetters Act inconceivably!—Revenge! Revenge! Not that they violate our wives for sport, And laugh at our unnatural endurance,— Not that they tear our children from their mothers, Crippling their limbs, extinguishing their minds With endless toil,—the only things that love us,— Not that our food is garbage; that our babes Droop at the milkless teat;—not that they dare, Oh shameless beasts! unnaturally deprive Our youth of manhood,— But because that they have so damned us That we've endured these shames! Oh for this murder, This poisoning, this pollution, this dead life, What, what revenge! They lash us into smiles! God! we will rush through blood up to our arm-pits!”— He ceased, overcome with passion; his clenched hands Signing the fury that had choked his voice, And rolled his eyeballs backward. In the cave Each auditor foams fiercely with his mouth; Motionless where he stood, and listened, and shook. With horrible imprecations at their lords, With wordless yells, they rage around the cave Like maddened tigers; tearing each others flesh And pledging murder with the outspurting gore. Amidst the uproar gasps the chief; his hair Cresting; his hands clutched up in vacancy; And an inward light burns lurid in his face, Like the reflection of a burning kingdom; And backward from his gnashing teeth, are drawn And fixed, his lips. One saw, commanding time And extinguishing space, and past the farthest reach Of the five senses reaching,—he beheld Glide from this cavern, while thus the chieftain ceased, A young man, and a maiden. To that caste, Whereat the chief did rage, did both belong, By birth and circumstance; yet the young man, By sympathy for the oppressed, to the slaves Felt himself bound. And she, the maiden with him, Loved him; and therefore thought his feelings noblest, And therefore shared them. On his shoulder leans she One hand; and opposite to him she stands. Her pity-parted lips, and glistening eyes, Answer the chief's harangue, and anxiously ask Her lover's interference. Yet she waits, All confident that he will end this shame; That now he will tell her how. Yea! never, Shall Christian, opening out his household bible When hours of anguish crowd round threatningly— Never shall soldier, while around his sword's hilt Putting a quiet hand, when tramp of foemen Catches his ear—shall pole-star seeing sailor— God, self-contemplating—feel confidence, More perfectly assured than that which beamed Light through this maiden's quivering tears, when lines Of high resolve, made architectural, The face of her love; of him, her sword, her bible, Her guiding star, her God omnipotent;— For woman, in the idolatry of her love, Believeth him in whom her soul reposes, Ever as divine in power as in will. And then the young man answers;—partly himself, And partly her, and partly unpresent things, Addressing passionate:—“And what were I, But a superior, a more criminal slave, Should I retreat to my abodes and pleasures, Leaving these wretched ones uncounselled thus! Give a man all his rights, and these alone,— He's a high animal, a noble brute! Crown him with duty, and you make him man; King of himself, and equal citizen Of all earth's populaces. Glorious duty! Give me thy crown, and though its weight be death,— Dying, I'll crown myself. Yea, plundered slave! Yet shalt thou know what glorious exultation, The consciousness of liberty; a joy Vast as the courser's, when in lonely freedom, He rushes wave-like o'er the gusty hill-top, Kicking his heels into the rivalling wind. And thou shalt know too, what divine repose Accomplished duty yields. Thou hast no self: Oh monstrous contradiction!—thou, possessing A curst identity, yet having no power To self-determinate,—a tortured tool For others' usage, which, when overworn Is flung aside to rot. You might have homes, And gambolling children, and affectionate wives; You might be loving, wise; for you are men! Man is eternal; tyrants, and slavery, Are but the tricks of time. Within the senate, I'll taunt our nobles, till they drag their crowns Down on their brows to hide the blush of shame. If I move not the king to piteous thought, His lip shall whiten. All their boasted order, Their laws unbroken, all the deep submission Of their whipped slaves,—is terrible disorder; Disorder of the universe, and of the heart. They shall know anarchy is abroad; more dread, That her wild step is noiseless, that her form Is undistinguishable, save at times, By the red fires that in the yards of law Curl round rebellious serfs; while then, her bearing, Hath not the noble fierceness of a storm god, But with assassin calmness, her cold smile Measures a secret dagger. They outcry, “The nation flourishes, its power is vast,” “Its wealth supreme.” Oh, idiot knaves and liars! Say, is a flag a nation? is an army? Do half a million traders make a nation? A thousand lords? The people is the nation; If they be slaves, if they be suffering, The power, the majesty, the wealth you boast, Is tinsel hiding the rottenness you ordain! And much they prate of station. Much they say Touching God-ordered ranks. Me they accuse Of rendering slaves superior to that state, In which, they say, it has pleased God to place them! They counsel—if your slave seem fond of freedom, Starve him, till he be glad to lick your foot And then get crumbs; if he would fain be wise, Work him, until the writhing of his body Shall suffocate his mind; if he would love, And husband womanhood, let famished children Of others, terrify; even from his birth, Palsy his heart with fear, darken his soul, Defile his body. Yea! this mutilation, They do advise, when smilingly, they say, Be slaves so educate, that to their stations, Their natures may be fitted. “Educate!” Ye villains sacrilegious, who would rob God's human temple of its majesty, That ye may stable there in barbarous pomp! Misname not thus your murderous reduction Of beauty unto baseness, man to brute. Man has no station; he must upward soar Towards bright-winged deities, or sink down towards fiends; Man cannot pause.— Go! bid the sun to rot within its heavens! Arrest the marching melodies of stars! Chill every river into stagnancy! Deracinate the fruitful earth of growth! Though infinite space grow dark, the soul of man Shall soar triumphantly. Within this cavern! Are thousands, sworn to rise from out the mire, Whereto you damn them; they will rise,—will rise, Though war may hew their pathway, though their march Be in blood to the armpits! Oh that it were mine, To lead them bloodless conquerors! They will rise,— But with the chains they shatter from their limbs, Must they do hellishly. A vessel, laden With captives fettered unto famine and plague, Now is this land; the slaves force-freed, will make it A burning wreck; themselves, amidst the flames, Maniacs, wild daneing. Oh who, who can know, How to redeem this people?” All this heard The seer; and more than this harangue did proffer Unto the ear, the seer beheld, and took, Down in the young man's countenance. And now, Came from the cave a statesman; his high brow All restless with anxiety; to himself He muttered as he walked,—“The fools I serve Under pretence of ruling; to whose whims Aye must I pander, and the pandering call Government, for whose robbery of their fellows That have no gold, I ever forge skilful tools And term them law;—will sooner or later rue The existence of this slavery. A power Repressed, yet gathering, and without a vent For its intenseness,—must in every body Do certain death. A power must either serve For or against the thing in which it dwells; Neutral it cannot be.” And on he shuffled, For there were none to watch him grandly walk; And as he went, continued he, “These fools Would hurl me from my eminence and renown, Told I them truth; why should I lose my power, To gain their hatred? The uncouth revolters A little while can be repressed, and so Repressed shall be; while I acquire the fame Of wise, bold statesmanship.” With a dark sneer At human error; and chuckling out these words— “Let the future look to it,”—the statesman passed. Him followed one, not lofty in the state, Not low; but finding there the middle rank; The rank which 'twixt the lowest and the highest Lifts an impassable barrier, and like A voluntary lackey, ever kicks The lowest lower. Rank, whose envy is To have some other under it; whose hope Is to merge into the highest; and whose action Is getting gold to administer these desires. His white lip writhed, as from the cave he rushed In savage wrath. “Our constitution, order, Obedience, command are jeoparded; No slaves! no master! Even upon ourselves, The beasts would have us tend! By all that is Holy and reverend; by our household hearths, These fiends would desecrate; by the constitution, Our fathers have bequeathed us; if there be Virtue in law and armies,—a swift cure Shall find these wretched levellers;”—this creature, Able to reason on the modes of serving His purposes, and his instincts; but no more; Forgetting, or unable, to examine Those instincts or those wills;—cried, rushing on Towards his home; the thought within him burning, That his dear children's sumptuousness and grace Were based upon this slavery. The seer saw on. And the cavern still shook with uproar; and the fury Therein waxed devilish. Swiftly from its mouth; Swifter than a river hurled from off a star That rolls unchecked; streamed high to the empyrean, Radiance of powers unhuman. In a moment, Above all lower firmaments, and above All clouds and winds, it soared. Immortal calm Received its glory. To the immortal calm The unhuman powers rushed,—as rushes one, From drinking in some exquisite music tones, To shun all else, and in unpeopled space Breathe rapturously. They circled round and round; Now sweeping vast and rapture-uttering curves, Now floating tremulously with happiness, Now solemnly moving in elated thought Of their own grandeur; while in unison, Circled above the seer their measured song. “The baptism of the earth speeds swiftly on! Earth's human things pour bounteously their blood! Rejoice companions! Soon will be complete Auxiliar changes, and one mighty change, Glorious outburst. No doubt disturbs our joy; Assured of the universe's truth, We wait expectant. To her sister worlds, Soon shall we convoy this long-travailled planet; Our pleasures thrilled to that ecstatic bliss, With which we watched the sun mount up in chaos, Before him wildernesses of shade dissolving, Till where he paused, towards him swiftly sailed, The numberless stars, that worshipping round him move. Rejoice, companions! All earth's crowded creatures, Leaven it for its fate, unfalteringly. And the blood and passion which must yet be spilled Into its substance, with a tenfold richness Sink o'er it now. The creatures of its youth Were few and passionless, and they spilled them-selves Half niggardly. But now quick human things Throng gloriously redundant; and they spring In armies to their calling; and they fall Of measureless passion full.—Herein is love! The movements of all things still gradual quicken, That followingly may our contemplation large From happiness to ecstacy. Rejoice! Rejoice, companions! on this embryo star, As on a myriad earlier ones, men grow Thick as the nebulæ of the galaxy; As on a myriad other ones, they pour Oceans of blood and passion into her veins; That, as a myriad other ones, this star May shudder into a thousand different moods,— The happiness of her changings never the same, Ever increased and different. Even now, The race of man is culminating! Now, Big is the earth with the superior creatures Waiting to displace man. Their glorious slaughters, Their frenzied passions, their quick-ended lives, Await our gaze. Oh, sweep, sweep on, companions! And glory in our delight! We still remain; All undisturbed our high prerogative, Of blissful contemplation. Though we know, Nought of the emotions which the short-lived children, Of earth, and all the planets, impart and share,— Be ye sure that even when their faces whiten, And their forms rend each other, and the air Rocks with their outcry,—not even then, nor ever, Reach they our bliss contemplative. We remain! All things beneath us change, and still we take From every change fresh joy. Beneath us roll Differently all things; everything us yields Joy differently. Sweep, sweep on, companions! And glory in our delight. Eternally, All things intensify; and we must ever, Intenselier contemplate, intenselier joy. Rest we above the cave. Rejoice, companions! Brightly speeds on the baptism of the earth.” FEMININE SPITE. The trial was over; for stolen gold, Robin the gardener his life had sold; The judge had commended to heaven his soul, And his head from the guillotine's hatchet to roll; The maiden who loved him did speed to his cell, And her brain shook with fear, like a vibrating bell, When there purposely met her the black-haired Lucette, Whose grass-flipping feet showed the village coquette. This black-haired Lucette oft had striven to make A suitor of Robin;—at church, and at wake, With her eyes in the dance, with her leg at the stile, With her romps in the fields, she had striven to beguile The senses of Robin, that so he might pray Her mercy, and she, with disdain, answer nay; But no looking, no romping, no unveiling would do, To the maiden who loved him poor Robin was true. Now to meet this lorn maiden, Lucette had put on Her flauntiest of dresses; her blackest shoes shone Against her white stockings; her white and red gown Was tasselled with ribands, around, up and down; She saw the maid sobbing,—her bright greedy eye Just glanced all around to see no one was nigh,— Then she sniffed, and she smirked, and she tossed back her head, And “You're lucky to know the young gardener,” she said. FEMININE GOODNESS. Soft to her bower the letter came, Where dreaming bliss she sighed; And signed by her lover's name It claims her for his bride; Like cloudless skies of summer night One hour before the day, Where in the east translucent light Beneath the dark doth play,— Her eyes well up with beauteous sheen, For though she knew 't would come, 'Tis fresh excess of happiness, To clasp it thus-wise home. But ere she left the bower, there filled Another light those eyes; Two crystal tear-drops o'er them thrilled, And half disguised their skies; But holier far, than tears of joy, Than tears of maiden fear,— They started for some gentle boy Who'd found their glance too dear:— And, oh! were I her lover, I Had rather found her now, Than when her eyes shone bright replies, To my recorded vow. “CAR LA PENSÉE a aussi ses ivresses, ses extases, ses voluptés célestes, dont une heure vaut toute une jeunesse, toute une vie.” Than all the suns that over earth have smiled, The summer's evening sun I love the best; Because it rayed when I beheld a child, Come from the cedar grove, at home to rest. His wide orbed eyelids moved not as he came; His cheeks were pale; his eyes were heavily bright; His lips were parted movelessly; pale flame Around his mouth played quietly pale delight. His forest dog went bounding to his side; His eyes veered slowly towards the fawning hound, But kept their fixedness, pre-occupied With thought, whence other thoughts did all rebound. His beautiful mother took his drooping hand; And when he lavished on her no caress, —“What ails my boy?” from across her soul's large land, Passed through her lips, with ravishing gentleness. “Mother, I know not; to the cedar trees I chased a butterfly; it danced too high, And left me underneath; the evening breeze Came with me there, and there it seemed to die. “And all was silent as the minster's nave On common days; upon the ground I sate, And reverence closed mine eyes, as with the wave Of silent and of soundless passing state. “Anon mine eyelids lifted, and I saw Above me terracing the mighty trees; The sun continuing utterly to withdraw His rays from out them, by composed degrees. “When the rays all were taken, and unlit The grove gloomed dark, again mine eyes did close, And in my mind, where lonely I did sit, The memory of the high priest's blessing rose. “As from the scene towards this thought I gazed, A mighty ecstacy through my brain did go, Like overwhelming ocean; cresting, raised My hair, while I did cower and tremble low; “For both one essence possessed;—the cedar grove, Spreading its shadowing boughs high o'er me there; And the priest's hands outstretched my head above, Solemnly sheltering me, with voiceless prayer. “It seemed as though into my brain did roll A thunder cloud, that burst in bright wild rain, Torrenting through my limbs, and for its goal, Mounting back mightily to my brain again. “I am not sad, mother; I have no ill, But a great storm within me doth subside; The ebbing of rapture wearies me; still, still, Me alone leave, dear mother;” the boy replied. Ceasing, he kissed her with serious pride; The while his hand caressed the hound's large head; And then away he seriously did glide; And I retired where e'er my foosteps led. Deems any, this vision, insufficient cause That I should love the hour that gave it me; Oh! knew he his own human-nature's laws, Much would he yearn to have been given it to see. The essence of mind's being is the stream of thought; Difference of mind's being, is difference of the stream; Within this single difference may be brought The countless differences that are or seem. Now, thoughts associate in the common mind, By outside semblance, or from general wont; But in the mind of genius, swift as wind, All similarly influencing thoughts confront. Though the things thought, in time and space, may lie Wider than India from the Arctic zone; If they impress one feeling, swift they fly, And in the mind of genius take one throne. This order of mind is shaken to the core With mighty joy, while therewithin cohere Its far brought thoughts; o'er the common mind's dull floor, As of old, its thoughts, rejoieing not, appear. This boy, then, suffering in the cedar grove, All rapturously, the uniting in his mind, Of these far-parted thoughts,—the boughs above, And the priest's blessing o'er his head declined;— Is, in embryo beauteousness, one of that band, Who, telling the samenesses of far-parted things, Plants through the universe, with magician hand, A clue, which makes us following, universe-kings. One of the seers and prophets who bid men pause In their blind rushing, and awake to know Fraternal essences, and beauteous laws, In many a thing from which in scorn they go. Yea, at his glance, sin's palaces may fall, Men rise, and all their demon gods disown; For knowledge of hidden resemblances, is all Needed to link mankind, in happiness, round love's throne.
