      <field name="fulltext">“Thus while I sung, my sorrows I deceiv'd, And bending osiers into baskets weav'd.” Virgil, Past. X. TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ. THESE POEMS, ARE WITHOUT PERMISSION, RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED, BY THE AUTHOR. SONGS OF THE SEA NYMPHS. SONG OF THE MERMAID. Canst thou Leander cleave the deep, And leave a maid like me to weep? Oh! let these bright tears call thee back, Why wilt thou swim this dangerous track? Thy Hero's frown thou need'st not fear, As yet no signal's waving there, The well known rock is wrapt in shroud, And slumbers like some mighty cloud. Turn gentle youth, thou art too soon, Oh! halt thee, while the yellow moon Shall trembling rise o'er Helle's stream, And light thee by her silver beam. Come love, and braid my golden hair; For thee my snowy bosom's bare, My thin rose lips are thine to kiss, And thou shalt roll in seas of bliss: These small white arms shall fold thy breast, This lily bosom be thy rest; On melting kisses thou shalt live, Such as no mortal lips can give, On sheets of foam we'll glide away, And live in love from day to day. Round thy bright locks no wave shall rage, For thee the storm I will assuage, And wrap thee in my azure vest, And sweetly soothe thee into rest; And lay thee gently in my halls, Of shining crystal are the walls; Oh! come and view the sparkling dome, Form'd from the crusted white sea foam, And windows of the congealed wave, And pearly baths where sea nymphs lave, And coral walks, and amber bowers, Where bloom our richest ocean flowers, That throw through waves a fragrance sweet, Such as no howling mad winds meet, Not Boreas with his sweeping gale, Nor Æolus who shakes the dale, And bids the flowery odour ride, Like lilies on the swelling tide; Nor Enna's painted fields of gold, Which gloomy Dis smiled to behold; Nor all the sweets of Asphodel, That throw afar a graceful smell; Nor Araby's perfumed air, Can with our ocean sweets compare; Their liquid leaves alone condense, All that is pleasing to the sense; Our groves which sprung from heavenly trees, By us were planted in the seas, When Neptune for the Olympian height, To some great feast would take his flight Then would he steal from Jove's bright bowers, His choicest trees, and richest flowers; And those ambrosial feasts above, He'd quit for us, to feast on love. To us those heav'nly flowers he gave, Which in our ocean gardens wave; We in return upon our breast, Permit his glowing head to rest; Nor dare do more, lest Amphitrite, Should dash through waves of rolling light, And on the amorous God alight; If so, she would his trident seize, Unchain the waves, let loose the breeze, And spread confusion o'er the seas. Come then sweet youth, and dwell with me, Beneath the broad, blue, boundless sea; See—where the moon thro' yon cloud rushes, She's come to view our bridal blushes, And when in sighs we die away, She'll call the wand'ring stars from play, And tell them all the charms of love; Next night, the flaming hosts above, Will mount their cars of shining gold, And move in splendour to behold Our sea green joys, and every night Will shine upon our soft delight. Dian may teach the tender heart, And on some bashful pale star dart, Then press it sighing to her heart. Come then my love, and with delight, We'll view the streaming hosts of light, In melting, glowing love unite. SONG OF THE NEREIDES. Merrily, merrily, 'neath the waves, That roll above the oozy caves, Where no hoarse wind wildly raves, Ride our uncheck'd sea born band, Along bright plains of golden sand, That's never touch'd by mortal hand. Through dark green billowy fields we glide, Where sleeps the huge mysterious tide, Which rolls on rivers far and wide. The broad deep ocean is our rest, Its pearly green waves form our vest, Which sparkling veils our snowy breast. The rushing sword-fish is our steed, We mount the shark in time of need, And thro' the watery valleys speed. Thro' hidden depths we glide along, While sweeping wild waves seize our song, And rugged rocks the strains prolong; Or in the deep, we join the chase, And through the long wide boundless space Of broadest seas, the whale we trace; We rouse him from his sea green lair, Around the deep his mad eyes glare, Then up he darts to catch the air. Merrily, merrily, we away— Above, below, we cleave the spray, And through the ocean deserts stray. We pass the dolphin rob'd in gold, We pass the herrings' silvery fold, And rouse the sea snake from his hold. The shark, voracious quits the dead, Where, on the sailor's corse he fed, And at us lifts his wondering head. Away—away—we ride—we fly— To where the mighty whale doth lie, Above our heads like some black sky. Through the green rolling sea we steer, Above the waves our heads we rear, And pierce him with our silvery spear; Then he uplifts his massive tail, And cleaves the waves like some hoarse gale, As tho' the clouds he would assail; Ten thousand fathoms deep he falls, And bounding on our coral halls, Like thunder strikes the shining walls. And when deep howling gales arise, We mount the waves and view the skies, Or listen while the sea-mew cries. Merrily, merrily, then we ride, From wave to wave, we leap, we glide, Or on huge billows sit astride. Our bright hair flutters in the breeze, While on the foaming waves we seize, And dash them at the clouds with ease. When Jove's cloud rending thunder rolls, And strikes the wide extended poles, We catch his big round burning balls, And fling them round from hand to hand, Then dash them hissing on the sand, Which covers Neptune's unknown land. We seize the lightnings as they glance, Where huge mad waves like mountains dance, Rolling along the blue expanse. We seize the forked gleaming blaze, That flashes round its burning rays, And on the white rocks wildly plays. We hurl heaven's fire from wing to wing, Form on the waves a spacious ring, Then round and round the lightnings fling; Flashing they stream, as cast around From wave to wave, they fly, they bound, Then hissing thro' the deep, resound. We listen as the seaman calls “All hands a-hoy,” then quickly hauls From the tall mast his canvass walls; Or, on the anchor we alight, Beneath the waves from mortal sight; They try to weigh—but vain's their might. Or, cluster round the ship's dark prow, Or bend her long projecting bow, And echo back their “yeo heave ho;” Then journeying on our sea green road, We hasten to our bright abode, That rises 'neath its watery load. And when our ocean sports are up, We with our sea god Neptune sup, And quaff the nectar foaming cup. We know no care, nor dream of graves, But merrily live in coral caves, Beneath the roar of rolling waves. SONG OF THE SYRENS. Oh come to our palace of sunshine and song, Where the blue bounding billows roll gladly along! Oh haste to our feast where the pale stars of even, Come in their bright cars from the broad fields of heaven! For our glad halls, the lamps of night, Have from the broad sky ta'en their flight, And sought our sea green jubilee, To celebrate a victory, Which the splendid moon obtain'd, Over the dark, that blackly reign'd Predominant; it was her turn, One night in heaven to sojourn, When a dark intruding cloud, Threw o'er her brightness his black shroud. See—she comes—the yellow moon, Leaves her highest, brightest noon, Thro' the dark green waves to glide, She passes by her daughter tide, And lights the hidden depths of sea, Where she walks resplendently. 'Tis sweet to view the shining seven, March from the splendid ranks of Heaven, And leave the centinels of night, To guard their queen of silver light, Who travels thro' our ocean caves, To illuminate the waves; She treads the depths In shining might, Like some glad citadel of light, That comes on patrol from the skies, To show the waves her glittering eyes. Stay mortal, and I'll tell to thee, How she obtained that victory, Over the sullen clouds of night, And bring it so before thy sight, That thou shalt easily descry, All their rage as with thine eye; See her lustre first emerge, How she lifts her silvery verge, Now brightly slow, she rises higher, While trees seem painted on pale fire; See her rising o'er the hill, While all beneath is dark and still, Now she guides her shining car, Headed by her herald star; View her rolling in her might, In silver mail prepared for fight. See her starry hosts unfold Before their Queen their arms of gold. Now coward darkness rolls away, Before the bride of golden day; See him shelter on the trees, View him mount the midnight breeze, Now he rests behind a tower, Now he passes by a bower, Now he settles in the vale, Now he hurries o'er the dale, Now tired, he hastens o'er the plain, And calls for aid on storms and rain; Now the battle sternly rages, Where the frowning squadron wages War with heaven's beaming ranks. Now they move, a stern phalanx Of howling winds and gathered clouds, Marshal'd 'neath their waving shrouds, Moving with determined frown, Bearing every bright star down; Led on by one black mighty cloud, Wreath'd with gloom and darkly brow'd, Tenfold darkness on his breast Appears in pitchy folds to rest: Black banners deck his blacker hand, His shadow hides the shrouded land; Now on the bright moon he advances, Now up to heaven her last ray dances, Which faintly lit a gurgling stream, That dimly glittered 'neath her beam; See, she has fled before his blade, Of blackest gloom and darkest shade; She stoop'd beneath his raven shield, But stoop'd to conquer, not to yield, For as he rushed in all his might, Upon his foe of lovely light, Wielding his blade of massive dark, He sprung too far and miss'd his mark. There was a moment of black gloom, As tho' the moon had found a tomb, And all dark voices gladly cried Victory! as though she'd died. Victory! shouts the howling wind, The owl cries Victory! from behind An ivied tower where she stood; Victory! shouts the gloomy wood, Victory! the raven croaks, The wolf cries Victory! then stalks, Sternly to his blood dyed cave; Victory! echoes from a grave, Where a murderer was employed Earthing a corse, quite overjoyed To think his black crime was concealed, Nor could to mortals be revealed; When lo, a pale ray quickly play'd In sudden gleam upon his spade; He fell, as in a death-like swoon, For lo, his voice new nerved the moon, Who springing from her ambuscade, Where for a moment she had laid, To let that massy cloud roll by, She on the murderer cast her eye. She chose her time when that cloud pass'd, Which frown'd as though 'twould frown its last; Then on a sudden she appear'd, And through the sable defiles steer'd, In time before that host of clouds, Marshal'd beneath their waving shrouds, That came on lazily behind, Creeping like the summer wind, Beneath whose breath no blue wave heaves Its sparkling head, when even leaves Will scarcely move; so these clouds stirr'd Like plumage of a beauteous bird, Which slowly spreads her wings for flight; Or like the last fond ray of light, That lingers on the western hill, As loath to leave a scene so still; But when the moon unfurled her sail, On heaven's blue fields the clouds turn'd pale, And flew before her shining might, And as they passed her, turned to light. Soon from their hiding places came, The starry ranks of shining flame, And all were glad their Queen to see, While heaven rung with Victory! This anniversary we keep, Once ev'ry year within the deep. Come then below the waves with me, And all the starry host you'll see, Seated around their queen of light, To celebrate this glorious fight. Haste then fair youth; why this delay? We hold our ocean sports to day. Then come to our palace of sunshine and flowers, And hear the wild music that floats through our bowen Or seat thee where beauty from dancing reposes, On sofas of amber, all veiled with roses; Or sleep on our banks where the nectar rill gushes, With tributes to sea-nymphs of kisses and blushes; Or lean on the moon's azure bosom of light, And press the rich lips of the goddess of night. We'll show thee the bed where the gay rainbow sleeps, And how, when she's absent, the summer sky weeps; We'll tell how she steals from the violet and rose, Those colours she gracefully in her arch throws. Come then to our feast, or thou wilt be missing, For we have young sea nymphs whose rose lips want kissing. SCENES IN FAIRY LAND. EXTRACTS FROM ADELAIDE AND REGINALD, A Fairy Tale of Bosworth Field. From Canto I. The sun had goined the distant hill, And shed his last red ling'ring rays, Athwart the ruby tinted rill, Which threw bright gems on drooping sprays. Reapers had left the smiling plains, Where harvest wav'd his golden head, Bending beneath the weighty grains, Which sighing gales profusely shed. Lovers had left the noisy town, And sought the hills or scented fields, Where health smiled o'er the woodland brown, And evening fragrant kisses yields. Anglers had left the winding Trent, And sought their homes—the finny realms Ran darker, as the night-breeze bent The lofty boughs of shady elms. 'Twas sweet to hear the village bell, Peal slowly thro' the calm blue sky; Or catch that sighing word,—“farewell” Cheer'd with the kiss which echoed by. Sweet was the sound of wimpling brooks, Which through old narrow arches stray; Sweet was the “caw” of wood bound rooks, Winging thro' heaven their pathless way; Sweetly the rural maiden's song, Rang o'er the tranquil evening scene; The ploughboy rolled his notes among Those warbled by the village queen; Sweet was their plighted vows beneath, Some aged thorn, or spreading oak; 'Twas sweet to see the wild-flower wreath, Twin'd round fair brows where bright eyes spoke Sweet was the sound of lowing kine, As slowly o'er the mead they stray, To gain some tow'ring clumps of pine, And wait the voice of rosy day, Sweet flew the gale o'er corn-fields ripe, And fann'd the cheek with scented wings, Sweetly the blackbird's mellow pipe, Along the drowsy woodland rings. Sweet was the vesper linnets sung, From flow'ry banks and shady trees; Sweetly the drumming pinions rung, Of hive-bound honey-laden bees. The buzzing beetle darting by, Shook the light dew from waving leaves; Sweetly the merry voices fly, Of children, toppling down the sheaves. Sweet shone the radiant evening star, Thro' shrouded fields of heavenly blue; Night shook his black locks, wide and far, The sable ringlets darkling flew, While trees to seeming giants grew. The nightingale, with thrilling note, Sung night's soft hymn:—the trembling sound, Light o'er the list'ning valleys float; Trent lingered, with green oziers crown'd; Sweet was her song:-dim nature smil'd In silence to her pleasing charm; So smiles some drowsy, well-pleased child, Lull'd by a song, on beauty's arm. Nought harsh annoyed the 'tentive ear, Save the alternate tramp of steed; Or rush of some adventurous deer, That sought the wood with lightning speed. A lingering group might yet be seen, Who talk'd of war's approaching fray; How mail-clad knights had pass'd the green, Full speed for Bosworth Field that day. From Canto III. Heard ye that trumpets piercing sound? Rang back by Richmond's answ'ring blast; Felt ye that shock awake the ground? When Clifton's stern troop hurried past. What change, was by that trumpet wrought, Revenge and uproar closely joins; War slumbering, is a tempest fraught With thunder—girded round his loins. A moment since—the sun shone bright, Reflecting shields returned the gleam; Another moment—and for fight The startling trump was heard to scream. A moment since—the archer strung His death bow for the approaching fray; A moment more—the arrow sprung, Whizzing—and low a warrior lay. Brave Richard heads the fierce attack, Dark death his sable banner bears; Amazed, pale trembling ranks fall back, Destruction on his blade appears. He grasp'd his column shattering spear, And sternly shook his shield of fire; Blood splash'd upon his brow severe, And clotting, stain'd his bright attire; Death smil'd, and toss'd his banner higher. So leaps the mountain torrent stern, From crag to crag, from rock to rock, Sweeping firs, oaks, beech, ash, and fern, Adown with overwelming shock. So rolls the thunder, bellowing deep, Shaking earth's adamantine base; So fire-wing'd lightnings fiercely sweep Cloud rending turrets from their place; So foams the sea when hoarse winds roar, And waves at heaven their curl'd heads dash; Loud gathering from the groaning shore, But to return with fiercer clash. Steed rush'd on steed—blade clash'd to blade— Armour to armour echoing rung; While foes on foes, were thicker laid, And frowning brows like black clouds hung. Darker with arrows grew the sky, Deeper proud war steeds dash'd in blood, Fierce flamed each warrior's haughty eye, Where shields like blazing comets stood. The clash of arms—the neigh of steeds— The groans—the clamour—the stern rout— The banner stain'd with bloody deeds— The roar—the tramp—the charge—the shout.— The rolling head lopp'd from its trunk, The locks of youth with black clots gor'd, The sever'd arm, that low had sunk, Although in death it grasp'd the sword. The broken bow that useless lay, Adown the dying archer's side, The wounded steed that sought the fray, The wreck—the din—the crimson tide— Appear'd as tho' the thund'rer tried To crush all nature 'ere he died, Shield confronts shield with mad'ning force, Deeper was plung'd the blood dyed spear: Fiercer was horse impell'd on horse, How thrills the blood those sounds to hear: “My wife”—he dies:—“my child”—ah! where: “My soul”—“die traitor”—mingled there 'Mid sounds that came remote or near, From beings, just merging to the sphere Where that God dwells, all should revere! While strength remains, few will relax The work of death:—each brow grows black; Plum'd helms gape 'neath the battle axe; Deep groans return the fierce blows back. So in a town, where storms assail, And fierce winds lay whole fabrics low; 'Mid rush, and smoke, and piercing wail, And blood retarded in its flow; And dust, and crash of rattling glass, And shrieks, and gusts, and thunder peal'd With loudest, harshest, quickest pass, Such was the din of Bosworth Field. From Canto V. Doubtless in childhood you have seen, Sailing along the calm blue sky, Cleaving the fields of brilliant sheen, And show'ring silver from on high, The bright Moon:—rob'd in snowy light, Plating earth's face with silvery ore, Waving bright chaplets round black night, Or diamonding the sandy shore? You oft have seen this beauteous sight, Not in the light your poet view'd, But stretching all tradition's might, All that with legends are embued, And fancy's countless multitude. Doubtless I say, when clear from fog, When clouds were calm, and riding high, You've seen the moon-man and his dog, With sticks compact, sail thro' the sky. I oft have look'd, but all in vain, To find his hat, yet never could, Can't say I've seen his head quite plain, So deem'd his hat was in the wood. I oft have questioned, when a child, What crime it was that brought him there? They answered, “he was very wild,” “And sabbath days did not revere;” “That one good Sunday, Satan sent” “His imp, who took him in a car,” “And placed him there for punishment,” “Because 'twas larger than a star.” There he was seated, silver brow'd, In heaven's bright fields, with night's fair queen, Embosom'd on a snow white cloud, That floated o'er the azure scene. To sleep in Cynthia's glittering arms, Be pillow'd on her radiant breast, Gaze when he pleased on nature's charms. And watch young zephyr to his rest. To drink the midnight's pearly dew, And dance with her o'er lake or moor, Stars, clouds, and comets to pursue, And ride in peace when ocean's roar. Like her to wear a silver veil, And kiss her lips behind some cloud, Then hoist the dazzling, smooth, round sail, And with her bright rays darkness shroud. Why 'tis enough to turn one thief, And send us sticking To gather sticks. every Sunday, Howe'er adverse to our belief, If sure to be safe moon'd by Monday. 'Twas thus I thought—I might be wrong, 'Tis hard to make good reason stand, Newton, and others have been throng, To prove the moon was sea and land. Such theories have great men taught, Not knowing 'twas the fairy world; I do:—to me the news was brought, Or rather, through my brain it whirl'd; I am no priest to keep it furl'd. SONG OF THE FAIRIES. Where the enamel'd snake doth hiss, And evening dews bright blossoms kiss, And white doves coo in downy bliss, We merrily dance our mazy round, O'er sweet unbending flowers we bound, While silver moon beams light the ground. On cloud capt mountain tops we go, Where heavenly gales their fragrance throw, Nor dimple we the drifted snow; Or resting on a midnight cloud, Or wrapt within a sable shroud, We sing to night winds piping loud. Our bright pavilion is a star, Its beams, the pathway of our car, We glide adown the shadowy spar; Or hold our revels on a rock, Where waves in foaming homage flock, Lashing the base with thund'ring shock; Or plunging thro' the white curled wave, We walk in peace the coral cave, Beneath the sailor's sea weed grave; Or pace the mermaid's pearly hall, Free from the ocean's deadly squall, Or midnight's dark o'erwhelming pall. We ride on lightning's wings of fire, Which gleam athwart the lofty spire, There strike we our enchanted lyre; Or sing amid loud pealing thunder, That splits the frowning crags asunder, And fills mankind with fear and wonder; Or sleep we in bright heath bells blue, From whence the bees their treasure drew, Our canopy's the evening dew; Or lull'd to rest with zephyr mild, That murmurs o'er the forest wild, Soft as the sigh of some sweet child. We guard the dark wood's raven shades, We guard the moon-lit smiling glades, When twilight o'er the mountain fades; Our homes are hid in bells of flowers, Our chariots are dark storms and showers, Red lightnings are our halls and bowers, Stars are our palaces and towers, Earth, air, and ocean—all are ours. From Canto VI. Here marshal we the fairy sprites, Who waited on their king and queen, Such beauty as the eye delights To view, bask'd on the hearth of green. First, Primrose cast in lovely mould, Grace in her fair light form was wove, Pity, so famed in days of old, Had made her gentle as a dove:— Next, Zillah had a dark bright eye, Where lightning hid its stream of fire, Bespeaking transient passions nigh, But soon was quenched her flaming ire. Fair Rosa, was a blue eyed sprite, Whose slumbering lips a kiss would wake, They hung so tempting to the sight, She watched the silver crested lake; Woodbine was sweet, her red lips curl'd Like flowers, whereon the bee doth rest, 'Twas rumoured throughout falry world, That Oberon the maid caress'd. Nightshade was crafty, dark, and deep, Her brow, bore thunder's sable hue, There anger lay, in feigned sleep, Her face, a lake that mirror'd true, These figured 'mid the numerous band, Who roved thro' Oberon's gay court, These were the stars of fairy land, And join'd their monarch's moonlight sport. Moonbeam advancing to the fire, Which on the emerald hearth-stone glow'd, Took from the wall Titania's lyre, Struck the bright strings, and sang aloud, Words which appall'd the list'ning crowd. MOONBEAM'S SONG. “Hail! king of earth, And sea, and air, Hail! mighty queen, And fairies fair: The rosy wreath, Which gave you power, And hung on high, In Dian's bower, Hangs there no more— But in this hall, Where I now stand, This night shall fall: Thy mighty power, Hung on that string, 'Tis withered now, Proud fairy king. Richard is slain, The stain'd white rose No longer blooms, The night wind strews, Thro' heaven its leaves, The stem is riven, Thy wand to me, The fates have given. I've found you light, Thousands of years, And for your crimes, Have oft shed tears, As o'er the sea, You waved your wand, And wreck'd the ship On some dark strand. Your reign is o'er, Your race is run, Beneath the moon, Or glorious sun, No more be seen, Your ruby bowers, Your crystal domes, Or sapphire towers.” He ceas'd—and hurl'd the golden lyre, In anger from his threatening hand, While Oberon's stern brow, like fire, Glow'd as he grasp'd the silver wand. Profoundly slept sweet Adelaide, On the rich emerald rose crown'd bed, Titania like Niobe stray'd, By the blue lake where Rosa led; Fair Woodbine trembled, sigh'd, and wept, Zillah at Moonbeam dar'd to frown, While Violet in a blue bell slept, And scarcely bent its bright head down. On a rich bed of chrysolite, Lay beauteous Primrose sobbing loud; Nightshade, soon glided out of sight, Frowning like some black rolling cloud. Unshrinkingly the fairy king, Took up the harp his foe had flung, On the bright floor, he swept the string, While Moonbeam trembled as he sung. OBERON'S SONG. “By nature's darkest, sternest powers, By earth, and sea, and fiery showers, By black destruction's deadly potion, Drank when the lake of hell's in motion, Drawn from the poisonous adder's tongue, Mix'd with the hemlock's juice, among The bitter roots of maiden hair, Which haunted towers profusely bear, And upas of foul deadly smell, Whose roots shoot thro' the depths of hell, And sea-weeds from the nauseous wave, And nettles from the dead man's grave, And docks that spring round gibbet posts, Trod by the feet of shrieking ghosts, And snake-weed from the shady wood, And nightshade with its jetty hood, And sable cypress, wrapt in gloom, And yew, that guardian of the tomb; By this strong draught, I drink and swear, No power in heaven or earth I fear.” From Canto VII. THE INCANTATION. Haste light-footed fairies, and mix ye a spell, That the power of Moonbeam this night we may quell; No matter how horrid, how grim it may be, Speed—speed—or no longer immortals are we. Search the cave, and the mountain, the lake, and the swamp, The valley, the desert, and charnel house damp, Glens, cities, and dark woods, where murder'd men shriek, Search the ocean, the church-yard, and tall mountain peak. Blow up the flames of crackling blue, Nor shrink at their infernal hue; For nine times round the cauldron we, Must 'ere day dawn, dance merrily. Three times nine, and nine times three, Beneath the moonless sky dance we. Bring the lips of a dragon, that's parched with fire, Which he breath'd, as he flew over mountain and spire; Fetch the fat of a martyr, just burnt at the stake, From the lips of a madman, the raging foam take; Steal the bag from an adder, you know where it's hung, Well stor'd with green poison, beneath his fork'd tongue; Bring the tooth of a mammoth, from Venice's gulf, And a skull freshly gnaw'd, from the cave of a wolf; Bring the head of a cat, that's lain months in a river, And tear from the breast of a vulture its liver; Fetch a bloated black toad, with its bright jewell'd head You'll find him deep hid in some huge granite bed, Blow up the flames of crackling blue, Nor shrink at their infernal hue; For nine times round the cauldron we, Must 'ere day dawn, dance merrily. Three times nine, and nine times three, Beneath the moonless sky dance we. From a death dropping vault, bring the slime of a snail And cut off the rattle-snake's blood chilling tail; From a cannibal's mouth, bring his foe's roasted bone, Nor heed his grim look, or the next victim's groan; Bring the head of an infant, that quivers with life, And the mother's hand stain'd with the blood dyed knife Fetch a worm from the grave, that has gorg'd till it's full At its banquet of brains, in a silver hair'd skull. A tongue white with fever, tear from the hot head, Where it loll'd out for drink, when the weary soul fled; Bring the thigh of a dog, that's bak'd well in the sun, 'Tis a feast raven's seek, but a smell mortals shun. Blow up the flames of crackling blue, Nor shrink at their infernal hue; For nine times round the cauldron we, Must 'ere day dawn, dance merrily. Three times nine, and nine times three, Beneath the moonless sky dance we. Fetch the glittering skin of a corse glutted eel, That has made on the mud buried sailor a meal; From a gibbet, the arms of a murderer bring, But hark! unmolested, let all the rest swing; Bring the mould, which an orphan tears up with loud cries, From the grave of its mother, who silently lies; Tear the wing from a bat, and fairies take pains, To find one that has revell'd 'mid mortal remains; Dig from the church yard, some newly marked sod, Which the foot of a pale ghost hath in the night trod; From the mark of a mortal 'tis easily known, For when touch'd, the dead start in their coffins and moan. Blow up the flames of crackling blue, Nor shrink at their infernal hue; For nine times round the cauldron we, Must 'ere day dawn, dance merrily. Three times nine, and nine times three, Beneath the moonless sky dance we. Bring the heart of a father, just stab'd by his son, With the blood trickling dagger which thro' it has run; Bring a mother's cold breast, where a fair baby sips The chill nipple of death, with its quivering lips; From the monk, who has slumbered twice two hundred years Bring his mouldering cross, and the dust of his ears; Once more to his grave, then the spell is complete, Fetch the white powdered bones of his time crumbled feet, Blow up the flames of crackling blue, Nor shrink at their infernal hue; For nine times round the cauldron we, Must 'ere day dawn, dance merrily. Three times nine, and nine times three, Beneath the moonless sky dance we. From Canto VIII. SONG OF TITANIA. Take the dew lighting star beam, that gleams on the rose, And the night breathing zephyr, when softest it blows, Take the light of the moon, when she sleeps in a lake, From the red blazing comet its fire tail take; Then shalt thou be, Immortal like me. Take a tint from the rainbow, a fleece from the cloud, A ball from the thunder, when bellowing loud, Seize the blue flashing lightning, when first 'tis awake, From the white falling snow flake its purity take; Then shalt thou be, Immortal like me. Take the foam of the ocean, that washes the sky, And a leaf from the campac, which never can die, Take a ray from the sunbeam, when first the clouds break From the gold budding amaranth its bright blossoms take Then shalt thou be, Immortal like me. Take the pale hue of twilight, when leaving the west, And a plume from the sun-eagle's cloud rending breast, When his nest in the car of Apollo he makes, And the gold from his broad wings majestic'ly shakes; Then shalt thou be, Immortal like me. Take a flame from the deepest volcano's lit bed, And a sigh from the earthquake, 'ere cities have fled, Take the mad rolling wind, when the crested waves shake, And the broad darkling shadows, which sleep in the lake; Then shalt thou be, Immortal like me. Take the lark's sweetest echo, that rests on a cloud, Or sleeps on the edge of a sun-rolling shroud, Take the enamell'd green from the sleek bosom'd snake, From the harp of an angel its softest tones take; Then shalt thou be, Immortal like me. FRAGMENT. The moon has vanished like some gliding ghost, That for a moment mounts the distant hill, Where waving trees appear a gather'd host, Through whose dark ranks the night wind whistles shrill, Came she alone to view a scene so still, Or to announce the tempest's scatt'ring rage? A sultry warmth dispels the night breeze chill; I hear the distant storm, it comes to wage War with the slumbering world, and will 'ere long engage. It comes! it comes! the cavern'd thunder springs From its dark bed; the clouds are rolling back To gather strength; hark! now the welkin rings, Nature awakes, hills echo, mountains crack, Now darkness dons his suit of blackest black; From clashing chariots leap the shining train Of blue wing'd lightnings, now is seen their track Through the dun thicket, now, sweeping the plain; The flying steeds are seen shaking their fiery mane. I am a child of tempest—and I love To view the lightnings wave their flaming arms, And hear the pealing thunder roll above The answering hills, nor shrink when heaven alarms The slumb'ring earth: her gleaming torch hath charms She then reveals, darting from vale to vale, Rushing in blazing splendour, to disarm Black column'd night; earth's clad in fiery mail, While loud, hoarse rumbling thunder shouts amid the gale. Who dare ascend the hill when tempests beat, And howling winds are loose and walk abroad; When on dark clouds the thunderer makes his seat, And bids his black artillery explode? Who's dar'd to mark him, as he proudly rode On his dun car, rolling from rock to rock, That echoing trembles 'neath the mighty load? The turrets boasted strength his hot bolts mock, He strikes—piecemeal they fall to earth with dreadful shock. Who's dared to claim a kindred with the storm, Or dance, link'd hand in hand with raging wind? Or mount the lofty billows, and perform The mad'ning reel, where seas roll unconfined, And wave worn vales with streaming flames are lined? Upon their blue curled heads red lightnings slide; Anon, the leaping thunder bounds behind, Chasing hot shafts, which thro' the valleys glide, While on white foaming waves the thunderer dares to ride. On mountain waves, behold—behold him stand, Hurling his red shafts thro' the sable sky; Grasping long forked lightnings in his hand, Ten thousand thunderbolts around him lie, At his hoarse mandate o'er the hills they fly, Split the firm rock, scatter the lofty tower, Aim'd by his piercing, dark, unerring eye, Hell gapes, and from the blaze receives fresh power, Catching the flaming brands, as sand inhales a shower. I love the open air, the breadth of heaven, I love the forest's depth, the mountain high, Britain's own Alps, the peak by thunder riven, The midnight dark, when fire wing'd lightnings fly, Waving their blazing banners o'er the sky, As tho' they gave the pealing thunder chase; Hark! now I hear the mocking hills reply In dreadful laughter, now two clouds embrace With furious clash; earth totters on its flimsy base. NEPTUNE'S PALACE. FROM HERO AND LEANDER. Far in the depths of ocean's flood, The rich domains of Neptune stood, Rising all glorious on the sight, Like some glad city of delight; So splendid was that massive pile, So wildly beautiful its style, That you might deem before your eyes, Had rose an ocean paradise. Here one eternal spring was growing, And strains of melting music flowing, And amber rills where flowrets lave, Their bending heads and kiss the wave That brightly gleaming, murmurs by, Reflecting deep its own green sky, Here birds in flowery beds were singing, Or thro' the groves of perfume winging, Their waving plumage beaming bright, Hovering o'er the gates of light, Cleaving the air of spicy bowers, Or wafted by the breath of flowers, That deck the varigated knoll, While streams of purple nectar roll, Where young Nereides repose, In beds where blush the crimson rose, Engirded round with golden flowers, With which the nymphs perfume their bowers, That fragrant stream along the seas, Like Eden's sweet ambrosial breeze, Which floats along the rosy ray, That ushers in the God of day, When first his steeds in dew are laving, Where purple flowers are brightly waving, Until their crystal bells unfold, Their mouths of pearl and eyes of gold. Land of the sea! what climes like thine? Where one eternal sun doth shine, Gilding thy dazzling coral banks, Where flowery diamonds wave in ranks, Which bloom alone in heaven and thee, Garden of light! land of the sea! City of song, and birds, and smiles, And flowers, and gems, and fragrant isles, And gold, and light, and perfumed breeze, And melting eyes, and streams, and trees, And fruits, and bowers, and nectar rills, Where singing bright birds dip their bills, And silver tendrils deck the vine Land of the sea! what climes like thine? Fair mermaids sport in thy bright isles, Lay on thy flowers and sleep in smiles, Sounder than the blushing bride, Who slumbers by her bridegroom's side, And drinks the long, deep, dreamy kiss, And rolls in seas of fancied bliss. Deep in a gold embroidered vale, That slop'd adown a rosy dale, Where amaranths were in the bud, The sea-god Neptune's palace stood; A massive diamond, shining bright, Replete with warmth, was sun and light, A cloudless sun, that always shone, And canopied the sea-god's throne; The dazzling dome rose bright and high, And bore the shining sea-green sky, That here and there was silver lac'd, A liquid heaven, firmly brac'd, Where oft a dolphin's golden head, Peep'd wondering from its green wave bed, And look'd down with a curious eye, From out its tower-borne liquid sky, Saw steep, and spire, and minaret, Lit by a sun that never set. The front, like Dian's crescent bow'd, A glittering arch, and richly glow'd With all the rainbow's varied dye, When bending clearest in the sky; Save, that instead of borrow'd bright, Each circle was a gem of light, Of ruby, pearl, or chrysolite: And for its arching stride was given, Room ample as the bow of heaven, When one foot on the mountain's plac'd, The other in the ocean bas'd. Three sea snakes form'd of finest gold, That massive arch did firmly hold, Where a long portico display'd, Its dazzling jasper collonade, That threw on a triumphal arch Rich splendour, such as conquerors march Beneath, with steeds and banners gay, And nodding plumes in battle 'ray, Prancing, where starry eyes are met, All leaning from a parapet, Waving a farewell scarf of light, To some young gallant mail clad knight. The winding flight that thitherward Led on, were diamonds, bright and hard, With rare mosaic work inlaid, Hemm'd by a ruby balustrade, And on the topmost golden landing, A group in bass-relief were standing; Of silver was that martial line, And bore the mark of Troy divine; Here Hector, and Ulysses there, With Neptune as Calchas the seer, Filling the Grecian ranks with fire; Whose gather'd brows bespoke their ire; They were by god-like chiefs led on, Tydides and stern Telamon. This led to Neptune's presence-room, Sweet as an island of perfume; Rich fragrant smells were wafted here, Which breeze, or flower, or beauty bear; Beneath that dome which lights the deep, With its huge rocks and billows steep, That lash the shore, or veil the skies, The sea-god's shining throne did rise; Cariates of topaz bright, Upheld the canopy of light, Their yellow garments graceful hung, Or round their beaming waists were flung. Above the fair Cariates, Were festooned birds, and flowers, and bees, Some with expanded golden plumes, Hung o'er the censor's waving fumes, While foliage shot around the room, And hung luxuriant 'neath the dome, Roses, and pinks, and lilies twining, The gem carved grape, with tendrils shining, As tho' they sprung from dews or showers, So bright they shone, a sky of flowers: While some suspended wreaths enfold, A dolphin lamp of glittering gold, Twice fifty such were swinging round, By diamond chains and jaspers bound, And when in radiance they burn, Dazzling they gleam on vase and urn, Of agate, beryl, gold, and amber, Up which the fragrant sea-flowers clamber. Along great Neptune's regal hall, Twice forty columns rising tall, Of rich engraven Corinth order, All massy gold, support the border, Of cornice, droppings, and festoon, And carved gems, bright as the moon; Between the space, by pillars grac'd, Large emerald pedestals were plac'd, Where amethyst immortals stood, Here Dian, goddess of the wood, There Venus, with her car and doves, And groups of Graces, and young loves; Here Hebe, with her cup of gold, There thundering Jove, dread to behold, And Mercury, with his serpent rod, With mandates from the Olympian god, And Pallas, with her gorgon shield, And Ceres, guardian of the field, And Juno, with her birds of pride, Spreading their jewel'd plumage wide, And all the great immortal race, Stood by each column's shining base; And every hand a censor holds, Where fragrant smoke in varied folds, Curls to the fluted pillars head, Where gems in festoon'd foliage spread Winding, where a fount was pouring Its nectar bubbles, grandly towering, Where rows of ruby columns blush, Bearing carv'd dragons, from which gush Deep purple streams, rich to behold, Falling from out their mouths of gold; The racy torrents brightly roll, And bubble in a crystal bowl, Which a silvery Bacchus holds, Wreath'd around with vintage folds. Here Neptune holds his sceptred sway, The god which winds and waves obey. SONG. I gaz'd upon her silent face, But death had rested there, And on her marble cheek I dropt, A burning heart wrung tear; And every breast was sobbing loud, Within that mournful cot, I thought my bleeding heart would break, But ah! they knew me not. I saw her settled eye-lids shade Those orbs of softest blue, Which beam'd a welcome when we met, Where dark trees closely grew; I saw her auburn ringlets lie, And have not yet forgot, How once I stole a waving tress, But ah! they knew me not. I saw those lips I oft had kiss'd, Like faded roses lie, I gazed upon her cold white breast, And gave a deep, deep sigh; I thought how once that bosom beat, When seated in her grot, And I recal'd my broken vow, But ah! they knew me not. I bent to kiss her placid brow, All eyes on me did gaze, Save those which had for ever clos'd, Their brightly piercing rays; I saw them strew around her bier, Wild flowers and knew the spot, Where once they bloom'd, I saw no more, But ah! they knew me not.</field>
