      <field name="fulltext">Quo magis difficilior, eo pulchrior, Hoc opus, hic labor est.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Printer. Print with a good letter, this booke, and carefuly Printer: Print each word legibill, not a word nor a sillabil alter: Keepe points, and commas, periodes, the parenthesis obserue; My credit and thy reporte to defend, bothe safely to conserue. To the Right honorabel, worshipfull, gentel, and learned Readers, whosoeuer; that are bothe trew fauorits of poetry, and of right ancient Heroicke Hexameters. There follows a prose preface at this point from which the exemplary verses have been extracted. If the Poet Stanihurst yet liue and feedeth on ay-er, I do request him (as one that wisheth a grace to the meter) With wordes significant to refile and finely to polishe Those fower ÃnÃ«is, that he late translated in English. I doe the man reuerence, as a fine, as an exquisit Author: For that he first did atempt, to translate verse as a Doctor. Naught can at once be begonne, or present made, to be perfect. By trauel, all hard thinges are brought to singular effect. Yer that Apelles could CytherÃ¦as beawty depolish; Had not he time to delyne, hir picture finely to finnysh? As yelo gould purified doth surmount euery mettell: So fine verse metrifyed, this rythme-prose greatly doth excell. With wordes significant, such rurall rythmery confound, And metricall verses with a new rythme lawraly compound. For sily Muse feare not: since euery paltery Rythmor With wordes vnmetrifyed would seeme to be counted a Doctor: Whose workes seeme to be good, representing Tantalus appels, Which did apeare to be gold; but toucht were, turned in ashes. Clowde not your Orient fyne skyll, with dregges of a drowzy Conterfaited prose: This Romane verse hath a glory. As redolent Gilyflowers perfumes a delight to the senses; Mens memories to refresh: So scanning Rythmery verses Bringes a delight to the mindes, &amp;c. As domiport slug-y snayle, his passage plainly to disclose, Leaueth a print as he goes, but a shining slyme to no purpose: So doth a bawdy Poet (his brainesicke folly to publish) Write amorous madrigals; some lewd loue-toy to recognise. Aime at a trew Period, Christ Iesus: flee from al euil: Roaue not aside to detract his praise: learne rightly to leauell. VVits misabus'd will apeare as a goulden ring in a swines snowte. Gods worde such reprobate lewde wits doth worthily confute. Shew me the tree by the fruite: so saith Saint Luke that Euangel, Do men gather grapes of thornes, or fygges of a thystel? Saint Luka, ca. 6. verse. 45. Saint Mathew ca. 13. verse. 30. 37. 38.Christ shewes by parables, who be tares and who be the good seede: Th' one by the diuell sowen, and th' other sowne by the goodhead: Bothe to be reapt at a time, and both to be parted asonder: Bothe to be bound in sheaues, and bothe to be laid from another: Th' one to be laid in a barne, th' other to be throwne by Iehoua, Into that burning lake, that burning fyry Gehenna. Only the fault was this; they liu'd in a time then of error, And to the Pagan goddes most of them yeelded an honnor. Those secular sages, which gods trew worde did abandon, Wilfully lost them selues, and others left at a randon. But should we Christians (confessing one God Imortall, Trinity, Vnity, one, deifyed with glory coequall) Call to the Pagan gods; to detract praise from the Redeemer, Our soules sole-sauiour? Should we such blasphemy suffer? When that Alexander did come to the Tombe of Achilles, That monument to behold; he pronounced these very speaches, And with a sigh thus said: Thrice LarissÃ¦us is happy, For that he greek Homer had, to record his glory so worthy. And when he had conquerd great spoyles from king Darius, There was a chest of gould, that, he said, was fit for Homerus Bookes, to be safely repos'd. For he kept them safe, as a Iewell, Vnder his owne beads-head: whose worke diuinely doth excell. And Maro laurigerent, in verse most glorious enrold Venturous Ãneas exployts, and worthines extold. Which brought Rome in a muse, with a grace so loftily flowing. Whose praise still wil abide, while seas or earthe ar abiding. Learne of MÃ¦onides; who writeth of Hector, Achilles, Of Troilus, Diomede, of craft-contriuer Vlisses. If so be that Chronicles had not bin skilfuly written, Kinges valiant exployts, lordes fame, and knightes valor had bin Drowned in obliuion. For time (fames greedy deuowrer) Leaues fame vnmemoriz'd; as a tree consum'd with a canker. You fine metricians, that verses skilfully compile (As fine artificers hard Iron do refile on an Anuile) This verse irregular, this rustick rythmery bannish: Which doth abase Poetry: such verse such meter abolish. For lily milke-white swannes flote on streames cleare as a crystall. And in a fowle mud-y lake, donguehill duckes striue for an offall. Both Greekes and Latinists such verselesse verse did abandon: Whose verse is purifi'd, as gould is try'd by the touchstone. As vineger doth aford, no pleasant taste to the palate: So wordes vnmetrifi'd, which rythmers rudely promulgate, Bringe no delight to the wits, nor sound with a grace in a mans eare. Euery worthie Poet will such rude rythmery forbeare. For curious cauilist but a small mote easily will see, Sooner in each strangers eysight, then a beame in his owne eye. Hardly he will such bookes in a trew verse notably perfect. For many men ready be to finde faults, hasty to correct. Such Sycophant humorists, like quayles feede chiefly by poyson: Whose Stoicall censures and selfe-mindes stand for a reason. The Author to his booke. Stay bisie booke for a while. What rage constraines thee to wander, Like fugitiue vacabond, into the world to be seene? Poste not in haste, so deform'd: let faultes be reform'd by thy master: Art not asham'd to repaire vnto the Court of a Queene? Vnpolished to repaire, to the regall throne of an Empresse, Our Queene Elizabeth? onely the worldes Diamonde, Crown'd with an eternall Diademe: whose glorious Highnesse Treasures of Poetry, chiefe in all arts doth abounde. Thou art scarce purifi'd, to be seene of her exquisit Highnesse. Better I thinke it, at home safe in a chest to remaine; Then to depart so deform'd, poore cloath'd, and plaine as an hermit. Selfe loue, selfe arogance, makes many fooles to be faine. If that I leaue thee so rude, hir Grace may worthily blame mee. What wil a Prince, think'st thou, of so renowned a Lande, When thou com'st to the Court so defaste, vouchsafe to peruse thee? Thy reuerent Soueraigne greater afaires hath in hand. Go not away gadding, from mee that lou'd thee so dearely: But com againe, that I may once yet againe thee peruse, Quickly returne to thy freend, with me to remaine in a safety: Com to thy maister againe, com to me, com to thy Muse. Manes, that Diogens seruant, ran away in a fury: Some wished Diogen for to go fetch him againe: Not so said Diogen, but laught, and thought it a folly: But prety booke I do seeke; how that I might thee retaine. What shal I do? For alas, my booke runs hastily gadding, In metrifi'd poetry, not poetiz'd as I meant. Some faultes you learned tolerate: fooles loue to be scoffing. Since that I thee manupend, now I to late do repent. If that he chaunce to repaire to the Court; I the Courtier exhort, Not cauiling to deface this prety booke that I pend: Though that he comes not adorn'd with robes; yet friendly to support And to reforme his faultes, if that he can them amend. No body shal thy report, with a glosing distich on extoll; Like popular parasite, or Thraso grandiloquent. Let thy desert be thy praise: seeke not to be prais'd as an Idole. Better I had thee refil'd, if that I were eloquent. Since that I plainely do see, thou wilt goe from mee so simpel, Therefore I leaue thee my booke, friendles alone to depart: Like Peregrine pilgrime traueling but meane in aparel, And with a name vnknowen: which is a griefe to my heart; For that I see many faultes, and haue no time to reforme them. Runne not away from me so: thy sily state I do rew. For many will disalow, and will thee shamefuly condemne. Zoilus is but a doult. My prety libel, adieu. A farewell to his booke. My prety book farewell: God send thee prosperus accesse Vnto the Court: to the Queene vouchsafe my name to be namelesse. Thy soueraigne Patronesse (if please her grace to defend thee) Can patronize thy defectes. Whom God preserue, as a bay tree, Long to be predominant, with Lords of her priuie Counsail: Namely the Lord Keeper, with learned lawes who doth excell: That Metropolitan eake, whom I think my selfe to be bound to; Th' Archbishop, at Lambeth: that wise Lord Treasurer also: And Senator Cecill; that apeares to the Realme a defender: Sonne to the Lord Burleigh late deade, his wise witie father, That sapient Nestor: which did by pollicy compasse Much quiet vnto the Realme. For like as CÃ¦lifer Atlas, On large broad shoulders sore pressed, propped vp heauen: So with his experience, this noble Realme was vpholden. For why? The state of a Prince consisteth chiefly by counsel Of witie graue Senators, whose witte with vertue doth excel. And I beseech God blesse that noble pillar of highnesse, Glorius Earle, Talbot, stout Earle of Shrewsbury; doubtlesse Vertues trew president: of al humane curtesy mirror: Mirror of armipotence. Whose nobel name was a terror Vnto the Frenche Regiment: to the Crowne still knowne to be constant: Worthy to be credited with a Prince, as a faithfull atendant: And to be chiefly preferd; that he may with bounty the better Stand a defense to the Prince, to the Publick weale as a pillar. And God graunt to that Earle of Oxford, mirror of highnes, Happines in this world: God blesse his Ladie the Countesse, Elizabeth Trentam, that right trew Maiden of honnor, Immaculat Virgin: whose house and name I doe fauor, With reuerence as I should. For I came my selfe of a Trentam, Aunt to thee, Lady renoun'd: yet I am not knowne to thee Madame. Loth I am yet to be knowne. For I should be knowne to the best sort: Knowne to that Earle Deuereux: whom I pray God daily to comfort, Vere, Deuereux, Talbot, three nobel principal howses, Ar to be greatly renoun'd, for their nobilitie peerelesse. QuÃ¦ supra nos nihil ad nos.And I do charge thee my book, with things not rashly to meddel, Which ar aboue out reach, that concerne vs but a littel: Nor to detract any fame, from Peeres or States that are highest. For littel meddling, of most is thought to be wisest, Ouid. Viue tibi, &amp; longÃ¨nomina magna fuge. As the Poet poetiz'd, that Naso Poetical Author; Frugaly liue to thy selfe: flee far from great men of honnor. For many men that atend some Lords, or daily do follow, Do but as Ãsops dogge, that a substance lost for a shaddow. Yet many men be preferd, by the meanes of great men of honnor; Such speciall persons which they most dearely do fauor. Farewel againe prety book be dutiful vnto thy betters: Humbly with al reuerence, submit thy selfe to thy Rulers. The Dedication of the booke to the Queenes Maiestie. Vnto the magnipotent, the renowned princes of Europ, Emperes Elizabeth, this petie libel I giue. Which I present to thy Grace, as a prime Primirose or a Couslop, Onely the flow-er of all our Chronicles, I beleeue: Skilfuly pend by the knight Sir Thomas Moore then a Courtie'r, Learned in arts: who delin'd that, that he knew to be trew, Grounded on experience: requisite to be read of a Ruler. This donatiue, Soueraigne, deigne to receiue to thy view. Giue but a grace to my verse, it mounts, O Queene, in a moment, Vp to the spang'd Element, vp to that ayry Lion: Giue but a check to the same, it falles downe (throwne with a contempt) Downe to the Tartarian riuer of hell, Phlegeton. A prayer. O my God, O God of hostes, God of Abraham, and God of Isack, And the God of Iacob (thou that didst regaly ransack TÃ¦rtarus infernal: who gaue himselfe as a raunsome) And here was crucifi'd, to redeeme our soules from a thraldom) Sanctifie thy creature, inspire thy grace to my spirit: Stand my defence, guide me with thy celestial eyesight. O my God, O Sauiour, vouchsafe me grace to my speaches: Then wil I magnifie thee, my mouth shal sing to thee praises Vnto thee only, my God, my voice shall stil be resounding Perpetuall praises, while breath and life are abiding. The Epistel to the Queenes most excellent Maiesty, my renowned Soueraigne and Princesse, Elizabeth, Queene of England, Fraunce, and Irland, &amp;c. So, I the man that am he, that afourds small praise to the Muses: And yet in Hexameters, I meane to metrifie verses, Vnto the worldes Diamond, to the PhÅnix rare; that doth excell In pre'minence as a Prince. Whose praise my wits ar vnabel Here to record, as I should: as a worke to large, or a matter Fit for a MÃ¦onian fine skilfull penne to decypher. Whose stout progenitours great fame, her glory doth aduance, Which if I could Poetize, is a worke yet worthie remembrance: Graunt to me no learning, Muses, thou Pagan Apollo, Cynthia, with Charites, thou blandiloquent mery Pytho, Mercury, with Sappho, Pallas nam'd also Minerua, A contradictory to the Paganiz'd inuocation. Graunt to me no fauour: But thou, thou mightie Iehoua, Thou, Lord Emmanuel, Lord of celestial heauen, Only God imperiall, to mee wretch terrestrial harken. Since litel helpe they graunt, and cannot aford any fauor; To those Idolatrous Pagan goddes, yeald not an honnor. Yeald reuerence to the Lord; who is the creator of all vs: And do not here atribute any praise, but wholy to Iesus. Shall we gods anger, by wilful blasphemie kindel? When Iohn kneeled afore that blessed glorius Angell, Do not so, said he: for I am but thy felo seruant. Reuel. 22. verse. 8. 9 Giue thou praise to the Lord, to the Lord, that is only triumphant: Vnto whom only belongs all praise, and glory for euer. Shall we, his creatures, then adore and inuocat other? 24. of Leuit. v. 14. &amp; 23.That sonne of Shelomith, which gods name wilfuly blaspheam'd, Was not he ston'd to death, by the Lord God rightfuly condemn'd? Sorcerer hight Elimas was iustly depriu'd of his eysight; Act. 13. ver. 8. &amp;c.For that he by speaches did deputy Sergius excite For to renounce our God: whom Paul and Barnabas also Taught him afore to beleeue. We should such blasphemie forgoe. Barnabas (in Synagogues) and Paul (that faithfull Apostel) Act. 14. v. 12. 13 14.Preached at Iconium: by faith, Paul healed a crippel VVhen the peepel saw it, they would haue done to them honnor, And brought them sacrifice, not praising God the creator.

He, by the said mariage, did vnite those notabel houses, Yorke and Lancaster: whose long contentius enuy Caus'd ciuil intestine warfare. This conquerus Henry, Venturus and valiant, was asygn'd by the Lord to be ruler. Euery King hath a time. Thus this worlds glory doth alter. Virg. Sic tr?sit gloria mundi. I he that once could not, nor meant, in heroical english Rythmecal Hexameters, any book so timely to publish: Yet when I knew that I could compose new rythmery verses, Lately become metricall, which are right verses of Antike; Then did I wish, that I could dedicate such bookes to thy person, Worthy so great a Regent; thy deserued glory to blazon: Which fro the East, to the West, doth spread.

And I with all reuerence, do beseech your gratious Highnes, Though many things ar amisse, yet pardon graunt to my rudenesse. Though that I, MÃ¦onides (who writeth of Hector, Achilles, Of Troilus, Diomede, of craft-contriuer Vlisses) Nor Maro Laureat am (who the laurel crowne to the Romans Wanne, as a Princely Poet: who recorded fame to the Troians) Yet, for a zeale that I haue, these primer fruites of a Subiect (Lately beseem'd a Poet) with a regall friendlines accept: For why? My pipe is of Ote, not Apollos, skilfuly compact: PoeticÃ¨. Nor Ciceroes eloquence I retaine; for a worke that is exact. Truly thy Princely benigne acceptance of my beginnings, Shall my minde animate, to record some greater atemptinge. For my delight (O Queene) my drift and only my purpose, Is to record Chronicles; metricall verse fitly to compose, And to refyne our speach, to procure our natural english, Far to be more elegant; that verse may skilfuly florish. Which when it is redifi'd, eloquent, and knowne to be perfit; Vnto thee, and to thy Realme (O puisant Prince) what a credit? Hexameters will amend our speach (thou sacred Eliza) Publish an Orthography, and teach vs a trew Idioma. Stories are requisite to be read of States that are highest, As Kings imperial, thron'd in regalitie chiefest.

For by the great diligence of men, mans memorie (chiefest Treasurer of knowledge; with learning skilfuly furnisht) Enroules in Chronicles the renowned deeds of heroick And valiant Worthies, their fame and victorie warlike. For Chronicles do recite faults, and falles, of many Princes, Horribly that tyraniz'd, sore plagu'd for their sory vices, Was not lofty Babel, first built by proude sory Nimrod? Whose arogance had a fall: and was not merciles Herod Genesis ch. 10. &amp; 11. Act. 12 v 21. 23 Suctonius fol. 162. cha. 49. 2.

Whose speciall rare gifts, and vertues daintily lusture, Like Orient Diamonds, or splendent pearles on a vesture. All you princely Regents, you Kings (well knowne to be Rulers) Learne to refraine from sinne. Our Lord God terribly sinners Impenitent doth plague: not a King, nor an Emperor he spares: All estates are alike. Who with gods dignitie compares? Cast downe your Diadems, your Crownes and dignity despise: Meere vanities count them, but seeke to do good, to do iustice. Yeald reuerence to the Lord, to the Lord your duty to performe, You are Christes Subiects, your Subiects peaceably gouerne. Your pre'minence but a charge, your life but a blob, but a blossom. When death strikes with a dart, what auaileth a King or a Kingdom? Erasmus in decla. de morte.That Platonist, Socrates, did afirme, that a mans bodie liuing, Was but a graue to the soule; which to felicitie lasting, Should by deserts demigrade: most diuine speach of an heathen.

For like as a fresh flower Springs for a time redolent; but can not possibil endure: So doth a king for a while reigne with great dignitie present; Whose great glorie decaies, whose prowde pompe dures but a moment, Like as a man doth in yeares wax ould, so should he be wiser: And as he groweth in age, so should his life be the beter. Thinke this world to be vaine, and thinke this life to be mortal: And to the King of Kings, let vs yeald out selues to be loyal. Who to redeeme our soules, ordained his only begotten, Only beloued sonne, to be sent downe freely from heauen, And to be here crucifi'd (as a sinlesse man for a sinner) To mitigate Gods wrath, t'appease his infinit anger. Who by the death that he di'd, hath cleans'd vs freely from euill: For that he conquered hath sinne, death, and also the Diuel. Whiles we do liue, let vs al liue wel. Time stailes away leapes, Similies. Like as a cloud vanisheth. For as euery steppe that a mans steppes, Is but a steppe to the graue: so plodding age, pedetentim Stouping, creepes on a pase. Age is to death as a pilgrim, Which for a time doth abroad wander; but in end he returnes home: Similie. So for a time we do liue, but in end death will be the bridegroome. Sentence.

Let not a man be to bolde, though God be mercifull, and staies. For when he strikes, his stroke is a stroke importabil alwaies: And then he plagues, when he strikes. For where th' almighty Iehoua Rightfuly plagues for ofense, what auaileth a mans cataplasma? For with a slouthfull pase gods anger goes to reuengement: But when he comes, he rewards eternall paines for a torment. Here I wil end, O Queen. O Lord our only creator, (Our Lord Emmanuel, our Christ and sole mediator) Adde to thy life many yeares, as he did to the King Ezechias: 2. of Kings. ch. 20. ver. 6, Safely defend thee from harme, as he safely preserued Elias: And that he graunt to thy Grace, after this life (as a chosen Vessel of his, purify'd) ioyes in Celestiall heauen; Ioyfuly there to remaine with Iesus Christ the Redeemer, Imparadiz'd as a Saint, with Saints in glory for euer.

Where fowre and twenty colaudabil Elders Seated in as many seats, all cloth'd with a white lily garment, Crown'd with Crownes of gould, on their heads stately refulgent. Seauen Lampes of fire, ar there eternaly burning: Gods very godly spirits, on God there faithful atending. Neare to the throne is a sea of glasse, which shin'd as a Crystal. There fowre beasts ful of eyes ar about that stately Tribunal: First was like a Lyon, next seemed a calfe to resembel, Third had a face of a man, fourth beast was form'd as an eagel. Euery beast of them, six wings had them to belonging: And ful of eyes ar within, day and night ioyfuly singing Three times, holy be God th' almightie, that euer is holy: Holy before which was, which is, which shal be God only. And when those fowre beasts gaue praise to the Lord God Iesus, Which on that throne sate (who for euer liu'd, who redeem'd vs) Those reuerent Elders their Crownes commendably threw downe, And fell flatly before that Lord, that sate on a Tribune: Worshiped him that liu'd, and liues with glory for euer. For thou glory deseru'st, that made all things by thy power. Vnto whom Archangels, and Angels greatly reioycing, With Cherubins, Seraphins, are there eternaly singing.

Marke what a chaunce hapned, that counter-checkt, in a moment, All their Courtly delights, to their cleane contrary Iudgement: For when as Edvvard namely the fourth, did know for a certaine, That these venturus Earles were sailed safely to Brittaine, Vnto the foresaid Duke, and there liu'd friendly together; Highly regarded of him, nor at all did feare any danger. Grafton fol. 715. Edw. 4.These sory new tydings, did aflict his minde not a littel: For that he thought those Earles, might bring him quickly to trubbel. Embassadors therefore to the Duke he sent of a purpose, With graue discretion, his message wisely to disclose: Who did acomplish his hearts, like wise States made many proffers Vnto the Duke, promising large gifts, and bountiful offers: So that he would vouchsafe, those English Lords to deliuer. Vnto whom immediate, this Duke thus framed an answere: So to do, it were not requisite, nor stood with his honnor. But least that those Lords, should seeke elswhere any succor, To preiudice their King, he deuis'd to seclude them asunder, With vigilant persons to be safe kept, one from another: And from them to remoue each Page, and euery seruant, Which was an English man, that there were on them atendant. Answered in this sort, they toke their leaue with obeisance: And so return'd to the King, to shew their faithful atendance. Who when he heard these newes, he beleeu'd that he stoode in a safety: His minde was quieted, quite freed from factius enuy. Therewithal, he to the Duke forthwith then wrote in a letter, How that he would him yearely reward; with thankes for his answer: Friendly requesting him, that he would those words but acomplish, Which of his owne free will, he did so faithfuly promise.

For when he considered, that rightly this Earle fro the lynage Sprouted of Henry the sixt, then he sought for a further auantage. Grafton. fol 732, Edw 4. For that he knew wel inough, if that there were any liuing Righteus heire to the Crowne, that lin'aly came from his ofspring, Might bring his Diademe, and regal scepter in hazard. Therefore againe to the Duke he charg'd graue men to go forward, Doctor Stillinton with two more, sent with a treasure Once yet againe to present, his Grace more largely to pleasure; If that he would but alow and permit curteus Henry (Nam'd Earle of Richmond) with them to returne in a safety, For speciall causes; that their King, bountiful Edward, Would ioyne in mariage (wherein then he seem'd to be forward) Elizabeth to this Earle; which was wel knowne to be daughter To their liege Soueraigne: which luckily fortuned after. Thereby this Earle might haue those landes that he claim'd in asurance, If that he were maried so nere to the King in alyance. And so the King stood sure, that none might make any tytel Vnto the Crowne, but he might all forraine faction expel. They in al hast get away their message wisely to transpose: Who to the Duke at large, each particularity disclose. When that he their message did know, he paus'd for a good while, What was best to be done, since th' Earle liu'd there but in exile: But when he considered that he should be matcht with a Virgin, Their owne Kings daughter, to be linkt in league with his owne kinne: Where that he might be prefer'd to some great dignity present, There as an Earle, or a Duke, to rule by the King his apointment; First he began to deny: but pleas'd with treasurie giuen, What with soliciting, and gould so gainfuly gotten, Kindly this answer he gaue; that he was content to deliuer Henry that Earle, not a sheepe to the wolfe, but a sonne to the father. Similie. And in a letter he wrote, how th' Earle was much had in honor, Both for his owne wisdome, valiaunce, and witty behaui'our. They then seiz'd of a prey, which they had greatly desired, Thankfuly tooke their leaue, and from thence quickly departed Vnto the towne of Saint Malo, bord'ring neare to the sea shore: Minding thence to depart, when ships were made ready. Wherefore Th' Earle when he knew that he should be return'd home, for very sorrow Since that he was so betrai'd, he fell sore sicke of an ague: Imagining that he should, as soone as he landed in England, Be stratagiz'd; but see: who can Gods dignity withstand? Gods diuine prouidence, and sacred dignity supreame Ruleth al humane cause; though humane causes ar extreame. Sentence. Marke gods omnipotence: whose workes ar wonderus, extant Still to be seene: who preseru'd this venturus Earle at an instant, Sau'd (as a strange miracle) by the faithfull loue of a stranger. For many times men ar helpt, and sau'd by the meanes of another, Like as a Physition doth seeke mans health to recouer: So wil a friend, for a friend, in trubbels stand a defender. Vulcan against Troy was: but Troians friend was Apollo, And Venus indiferent, Pallas not: mortaly Iuno Malliced Ãneas, as alyed wholy to Turnus; Yet was he by Venus helpe, preseru'd from her enmitie grieuus, Vndubitate Pylades was a friend to woful Orestes: To Damon, Pythias: Patrocles friended Achilles: Diuers examples. Virg. Alcyde ayded Hylas, Ãneas friend was Acbates: Eurialus, Nisus: Diomedes friended Vlisses: And to be chiefe memoriz'd, that firme and trusty Zopirus, Who cut his owne eares off, Babilon to procure Darius. Darius stout King, in his hand faire Pomegranat hauing, Plutarch in Apo. One of his especial friends askt him (merrily iesting) What things especiall (if he might haue that that he wished) Would he request for his owne? As there were graines to be counted, So many friendly Zopyres (as a wise King) wisely did answer. For what more pretius, then a friend that friendeth another? Pluta in Apo. As fire and heate both, cannot be parted a sonder: So loue and friendship cannot be without one another. For when on Iohn Chewlet (that was for a Courtier, only Counted a stout man at armes) who lou'd this gratius Henry, Heard that he was very sick, and from thence like to be conueigh'd, Grafton. fol. 738. Edw. 4. Shortly to King Edward, he (therewith wosuly dismaid) Posted amaine to the Court, and present slept to the Kings Grace, Heauily perplexed: who looking sad with a pale face, Stood as amased afore this Duke, with a stearne heuy count'nance, And not a word did speake: as a man that wanted his vttrance, Therewithal astonied, to behold so feareful an obiect (Like as a Prince vigilant) he did some treachery suspect: Yet when he considered this Knights state, chearefuly thus spake; Shew me the cause (good Iohn) that thou so monesuly dost looke. Therewithal he, to the Duke reuerent, with an humbel obeysance, Boldly declar'd what he meant, and spake with a treatibel vttrance; Sentence.Pardon I craue, Soueraigne, if I speake: Truth verily neuer Shameth his owne master. What auailes then fondly to flatter? Heare then a truth, O Duke, for like as Cynthia shining, Inueloped with a clowde, obscures herselfe from ilustring: Similie.Semblably truth for a time obscur'd, many times lieth hidden; Truth yet in end wil apeare: truth neuer permaneth vnknowne. O my renowned Duke, wilt thou now falsify promisse, Firmely betroth'd to this Earle? What a fault is this, what a blemmish? O that I were buried. Shal I liue to know thy dishonor? Truly my minde (O Duke) is vext with an infinit horror, Similie. For that I greatly do grieue, that this stout Earle to the slaughter Should (as a lambe) be betrai'd, and there to be slaine of a Butcher. This wil bring thy renowne, O Prince (which euery mans mouth Extols vp to the clowdes) to decay. For (plainely to tell trouth) If so be (my Soueraigne) thou wilt so shamefuly suffer Henry this Earle to depart, thou stain'st thy glory for euer: Thy former valiance, and fame that shine to the worlds end, Shall as a smoake pas away. Shal a Prince such craftines intend? Similie Peace good Iohn (quoth the Duke) peace, peace: I pray thee beleeue mee: For these Embasadors do protest and say that he shal be Grafton. fol. 738. Edw. 4.Spows'd to the Kings daughter (which their King faithfuly promist) And to be next to the King, plaste in authority chiefest. Well, said Iohn to the Duke, in whom shall shame be reputed, If that he dye by the way, or in English Realme be beheaded? For that I dare venture my life, that it is but a practice This sily soule to deceiue, this sicke Earles life to relinquish: If that he shal be beguil'd in such sort, let me no longer Liue to repaire to thy Court: if he should dye, dye had I rather. Laertius. lib. 4. chap. 2.When Dionise the tyrant, would needes haue Plato beheaded, Zenocrates answer'd; not afore that mine be depriued. But many say, that a King that knowes not how to disembel, Knowes not at all to rule: such sleights be deuis'd by the Diuell, If that I may be so bould to speake but a word in his absence, O my benigne Soueraigne, lend eare and giue to me credence. For why? This Earle of a truth lyes sick, and likely to perish. Similie. If fro thy Realme he depart, what Prince will trust to thy promise? Nothing more perilus, then a compound poysonus honny: No body more trecherus, then a foe, that seemes to be friendly. With tunes harmonicall sweete singing merrily Meremaides Similie.

Bluddy Polymnestor (which of gould was so desirus) Beastly did obtruncate Priamus sonne, young Polidorus. Virg.More to recite, what auailes? Therefor I humbly beseech your Grace (O Duke) to remember Grafton fol. 739. Edw. 4.This disconsolate Earle, that lyes neare dead of a feauer: Send that he may be retain'd. Let not thy glory be blemmisht: Keepe faith inuiolate, let a prince performe what he promist. Thus this Knight, to the Duke, his whole minde (wofuly distrest) Plainely without any guile, or dissimulation, exprest. Lastly, by perswasions, this wise Duke (rul'd by the Counsell Of good Iohn Chewlet; who this Earles state knew to be feebel) Sent Peter Landoyse, chiefe Treasurer, only the foresaid Embassadors to delay; that th' Earle might safely be conuai'd Vnto the Sanct'ary there: which was with speede then efected. Which so delighted his heart, that his health there quickly reuiued. Like as an Hart in a chace, that is hurt or pincht with a greyhound, Similie. Bounceth away on a maine, and runnes most swiftly, to get ground: Yer that he should b'imbost, fro the greyhound speedily doth get, And priuy lewnes in a brake, imbaies himselfe in a thicket; There to recouer his hurt: So this Earle (escapte from a daunger) Liu'd in a place priuiledg'd, his former health to recouer. Would to God euery Prince, that ruleth in euery Kingdome, Would be so rul'd by the good wise counsell, and by the wisdome Of plaine trouth-speakers, and also that euery Courti'er Would not aledge any lyes to the Prince, to defame on another. Now to my matter againe. When these Embasadors perceiu'd they were so deluded, Grafton. fol. 739. Edw. 4.Both of an Earle, their prey, and of gould freely deliuer'd; Tould Peter Landoyse, their king would take it in ill part, They to retorne so deceiu'd, of their Earle and mony homeward. But Peter Landoyse assured them, that he should be Safe in a sanct'ary kept (which they would warily foresee) Or to be streightly detein'd, in a safer custody forthwith; So they neede not at all, to doubt or feare any mischiefe. They pacifi'd by the meanes of Landoyse curteus answere, Thought it a folly to stay in Brittain Realme any longer: But willed Landoyse (to the Duke their duty remembring) Those promises to be kept, their leaue there then fuly taking: Who promised that he would. So these Embasadors sail'd thence, and landed in England, Grafton. fol. 755. Edw. 4. And there tould to the King each chiefest point of his arrand. Who when he heard their speach, perswaded partly by reason, How that he should be detein'd there safe, or safe in a prison (He not at all fearing th' intendment of fory persons) Shew'd himselfe as a Prince, more bountiful vnto the Commons, And liberal to the poore. But time his course hath: time staylesse daiely doth happen, Sentences. With swift breach curelesse, with gould not againe to be gotten. O wauering fortune, when thou seem'st most to be smiling, PoeticÃ¨. Mutabil intendment meanest, and mischievus ending. Euery time hath an end, O worldly varietie, neuer Knowne to remaine constant! What is here that permaneth euer? For stout king Edward, when he found himselfe to be sore sick, And when he thought that he was (in a manner) past any physick, Streight to the Queenes kindred, did send on away in a poste-hast; Grafton fol. 760. &amp; fol. 761. Edw. 5.Vnto the Lord Riuers (whom he knew to be firme, to be stedfast) And to the Lord Hastings (Lord Chamberlaine then of England) And to the Lord Marquesse (whom she first had by her husband Named Sir Iohn Gray, which was made knight in a battell Fought at Saint Albons, and there was slaine: who did excell In valor of Knighthood) Willing them to repaire to the Court, with speedines, eftsoones, And to resort to the King, for diuers and many reasons. VVho to the Court in al hast did come: who courtly saluting Were resaluted againe, on another semblably greeting. Euery Lord that came to the Courte, by the King his apointment VVent to the Kings presence. When he saw them there to be present, He took them by the handes (though inward panges with a sorrow Greatly molested his hart) and, vnderset with a pillow, Spake to them, as foloeth: My Lordes, and kynsmen, your presence hartily welcom: King Edwards last will or admonition to the Queene, his children, and Nobility. Whose frendshippes I found more sure to me, than a kingdom. My life is but a blast, I feele death woful aproching: And I reioyce, that I haue my freendes here at my departing, My body wasteth away, I fynd my self to be feebel, Also my blud to decay: I feele my self but vnabel For to pronounce many wordes. Therefore, my Lordes, to me listen. Concord in friendship, be faythfull vnto my chyldren: And to my Sonne, your Prince, I charge you for to be loyall, Safe to preserue his Grace, to defend this Realme vniuersall. For the Cicil tyrrants could find no greater a torment, Then cruel enuy, that hagge, which fosters deadly reuengement. Seneca in Epist. lib. 14. Marcus Agrippa declar'd that small thinges daily, by concord, Eftsoones grow to be great: and great thinges, fondly by discord, Quickly declyne to ruine. Plutark in reg. Apotheg. &amp; Stob. ser. 82.That graue ould sapient Scyllurus, nam'd Chironensis (Fowre score sonnes who begate) when he lay sick, thus did he publish: Euery one, deare sonnes, in his hand here take but an arrow, And break them forthwith. Which they did speedily. But now Each on a sheafe of shaftes, my sonnes, take, forcibly break them. Which to do, each did asay; but could not. Then with a solemne Similie.Speach thus he spake; As you could not them break: So, my children, Trew fyrme and constant coniunction of many brethren No body can dissolue. Therefore liue frendly together. If so be you seperate your selues each one from another, Then shall your enemies (as a prey snatcht vp of a Tyger) You (disagreeing so) with a small force easily conquer, So my beloued Lordes, if you, by malicius enuy, Shall fall at variaunce, which of you standes in a safety? Prosperus are Kingdomes, publick weales statefuly florish, Where States concording do perfect amity stablish: Sentence. But when a Realme disagrees, that Realme is seene very seldom Long to remaine a Monarche. For certaine euery Kingdome Hatefuly disseuered (fayth and tranquillity wanting) Turned is vp side downe, ruinus disconsolat ending. Hate doth a Realme ruinate. Therefore my Lordes, I beseech you, Euery one to be frendes, my precepts duly to follow. Euery Lord, by the hand, there present tooke on an other (Who did apeare to be frendes) though their heartes were far asunder. And then he spake to the Queene sore greev'd: who mournefuly looking, Teares from hir eyes gusht forth, as bubbling blobbes from a welspring. Farewell dearly belov'd: your children charily cherish, See them well to be bred with good and singular aduise. And you, my children, be dutiful vnto the mother: Vse these your kinsmens counsayle, in stead of a father. For litel yong children should wisely be rul'd, by the counsayle Of wity graue Senators, whose fame and vertue doth excell. And, with a sorroful hart his children sadly beholding, Stretched his hand to them all, these same wordes faintily speaking; God blesse you children, farewell Lordes dearly beloued: Who with trickling teares (sad sighing) wofully mourned. And then he held vp his handes to the Lord, his mercy beseeching, And to receiue his soule, to the ioyes that ar euer abiding. Therewithal he faynting in a swoune grewe straight to be speachlesse, Gasping breath who did yeald, with a pale face and body senselesse. Whose soule imparadiz'd, I belieue is with the Creator, Our Lord Emmanuell, our Christ; and sole mediator. Who when he had regaliz'd 3. yeares and credibly twenty, Tomb'd in a faire monument, at Windsore lies, in an abbey. How that he dy'd, many men did doubt. For he dy'd on a suddayn. Sundry, by surfet, afirm'd: which no body knew to be certayn: But many thought, that he was put away, by the vile priuy treason Of tyranus Richard, by the meanes of some sory poyson: As Sir Thomas More, in his owne book skilfuly penned, Thought (by the speach that he learn'd) that he was sure priuily poysned. And not a thing vnlyke. For he spared no body, whose life Might dominire as a King, whose life might work him a mischiefe. He was a vile Machauile, and still tooke time at a vauntage. To work such stratagemes, his lew'd mind gaue him a courage. Similie.As wax is molify'd, and clay made hard, by the sun-shine: So to the word of God, good mens hearts daily wil enclyne: But lewd are hardned by the word. Such obstirat error Permaneth in reprobates: whose end is damnable horror. Description of Edward the fowerth.This valiaunt Edward was a Prince, of a beawtiful aspect: Whose face shyn'd with a faire sanguine complexion indeckt: Whose yelo burnished haire did shyne, like glorius amber: Similies.Whose gray eyes twinkling, like starres, did cheerefuly glister: Comelines of person, very tall of bodily stature: Exquisit euery part was featured: and of a nature Merciful and liberal: whose stout hart (bouldly by wisedom And politick valiaunce) of right did atayn to the kingdom. He was a Prince patient, in great prosperity pleasant, And not at all arogant, in great aduersity constant, Not timorus wauering: to steadfast friend very faithfull: To fra'dulent enemyes, seuere, implacabel, hatefull: Fortunat in warfare: but somewhat gi-uen (in excesse) To womanish daliaunce, as his hystorie plainly doth expresse. This stout king Edward many times would say, that he lov'd well Three speciall paragons, in seu'ral gifts who did excell: First was wily by kind: but an other seem'd to be godly: Shores wife was meriest, as a woman void of al enuy. The iust and lawfull title, that Richard Duke of Yorke, father to king Edward, made to the Crowne of England. Richard Plantagenet, Duke of Yorke, rightly the garland Sought by law to regaine; his right to the Crowne then of England: And he preferred a byll, to the nobil common asembly, Grafton fo 757. et 758.Held at Westminster. Where after merciful Henry (Namely the sixth) his death, they all (there iointly together) Graunted by parliament.Gaue this Realme to the Duke, his right heires in the remainder. But this stout Richards stout lucklesse mynd was vnabel, For to prolong so long: but in end was slaine in a battell, Neare to the towne Wakefield (and left here these many children; Edward, George, Richard: all three well knowne to be brethren) And yet he sware many times by solemne othes, that he neuer Stow. fol. 944. &amp; fol. 972. Would any treason atempt, or against him raise any power. His three sonnes, whom I nam'd, were like three Martial Hectors, All of a stoutnes alike, on anothers glory detrators. This foresaid Richard, to the foresaid fortunat Edward, Was father vudubitate: sonne and heire namely to Richard, Stout Earle of Cambridge; Who maried Dame Anne, sole heire and daughter of Edmund Mortimer, Earle of March, Richards neece, namely the second. So that he was, by the lawes, right lawfull heire to the Kingdome: Which Edward did ataine by force, and partly by wisdome. Henry the fourth did vsurpe, and put downe wrongfuly Richard, Second King by name, at Pomfort slaine, by the coward Sir Pierce of Exton: who strake him downe, as a butcher Striketh an ox, on his heade. Wo worth so shameful a monster. This trecherus bludy Duke did bring eight tal men in harnesse, Grafton fol. 412. Henry. 4.Each man a bill in his hand, like thieues, to murder his Highnesse: Who with a bill that he got by force, did manfuly withstand Those Machauile hypocrites (for he kild foure men with his owne hand) Till that he was struck downe by the Knight: who leapt in a chay-er Like crauenus coward, to repose him selfe from a daunger. The Second booke of the tyranny and vsurpation of king Richard: and how king Henry the seauenth, when he was Earle of Richmond, was preserued in his time. A praier. I (He, that here doth apeale to the sacred seate of a Kingly, Kingly tribunall throne, of a King celestial only, Only the King of Kings, the triumphant Lord God imortall, Three persons, one God, deifi'd with glory coequall) Humbly before thee my God, that King, &amp; Lord God of heauen, Wholly my selfe prostrate, giue eare, O Lord to me listen: Ephe. 2. 5, 8. Sanctify me by thy grace, and iustify me by thy mercy, For by the grace of God, comes our saluation only. Graunt that I may paraphrase, stout Henries glory to publish, And to promulgat abroad King Richards tyrrany diuelish. I he, that only before (in Romane rythmery verses) Did modulate, with a thinne oten pype, fortunat Henries Flight that he made to the Duke, with his vncle; there in a safety Both to remaine for a time, till time should prooue to be friendly. Which was a worke of thanks: But now, now, murtherus horror, And Machauile stratagemes I record of a lewde malefactor, That did vsurpe as a king, that killed his owne very brethren, Murdered his Nephues wife, and many Peeres, or a sudden, Mournefuly Muse manifest the detested deedes of a tyrant, Monster of all mankinde; whose sinnes to the world ar aparant: With salt watery teares, this wofull tragedy pensill: Teares, from a sabel penne of direfull Ebony, distill. I to the clowdes seeke not to mount, like Icarus in sky: Ouid. poeticÃ¨. Nor like proud PhaÃ«ton, with a minde presume to be lofty. Witty Thales maiden, that saw him looke vp on heauen, And in a ditch to decline; he is wel seru'd, quoth the maiden, For that he looked aloft, when he should haue lookt on his owne feete. Looke not aloft sily Muse: but shew thy selfe to be discreet. Here I do meane to declare (O Queene) how shamefuly Richard, That Duke of Gloster (but a younger brother of Edward, Lately the King) did ataine to the Crowne, and dignity regal. Trewly my minde doth abhorre that I should here make the recitall, What Machauile policies, what shifts, what crafty deuises, What tyranus stratagemes he deuis'd, to crucifie Princes. First of al, here to beginne; he stab'd and kill'd with a dagger Henry the sixt, when he was safe kept (as a prisoner) in Tower. Grafton fol. 713. Edw. 4.For that he considered King Henries life was an hind'rance, Both to the King, and him: by the which they wanted asurance. Therefore he did this fact, his brother firmly to settel In throne of Regiment (whose state he knew to be fickel) For that he knew that he might, when a sure foundation is laide, Build, as he would himselfe. Can a building stand that is vnstaid? Similie.Like as an hungry Lyon (ramping) will seeke to deuow-er Euery beast that he meetes, til he hath ful apeased his hunger: Sentence. Nulla fides, regnisocijs. c &amp;.So this vile bludy Duke their deathes did wilfuly conspire, Which did opose themselues, that he might not ataine to this Empire. For greedy thirst of gould, and feruent loue of a Kingdome, All felo mates doth abhor: there faith is found very seldome. Like as a weak patient, that lyes sore sick of a dropsy, Similie Drinkes, yet is alwaies dry; so that no liquor, his hasty Or greedy thirst, can alay: So mindes that proudly desi-er Grafton. fol. 781. &amp; fol. 7 Edw. 5. Imperiall regiment, still thirst, and long for an Empyre. Next he, the Duke Clarence (his brother) caus'd in a malmsey Butte to be drown'd, as a Duke (though guiltlesse) found to be guilty: Immagining that he might, then sooner ataine to the Kingdom, When that he was put away. For he diu'd each drift to the bottom. Like Auroras birde, that fluttereth vp to the welkin, Similie. So areth aloft higher, then a grosse mans sight can imagine: So this proud greedy Duke (whose minde so lofty did aspire) Reached a thought higher, than meane wits thought, to this Empire. O what a vile perilus serpent, what a cormoran helhound Sentence Is cruell ambition! which seekes mans glory to confound. For mindes insatiate wil atempt still, still, to be highest: First to be greatly preferd; next, equall; then to be chiefest. See Iames. 3. v. 16 17.Ambitius wisdome comes not from aboue; but is earthly, Sensual, and diuelish, contentius, and ful of enuy: But sapience from aboue, is gentel, merciful, harmelesse, Wrongfuly not iudging, but void of hypocrisie doubtlesse. Now to proceede, as I meant. King Edward, when he knew that he was so spitefuly drowned, His sory misfortune, and lewd luck, greatly repented. For when as other Lords would speake for a lewde sory person (Humbly beseaching him, that he would vouchsafe him a parson) Sadly the King would say, many times, O brother vnhappy! For whom, no body would once seeme to request any mercy. But many men do repent, when it is too late to redresse it. That priuy vile bludy fact, that he did so shamefuly permit, Strake a remorse in his hart. Surely the more that a mind is clogd with a grevius offense, More dolor and anguish doth torment daily the consci'ence. Sundry report diuers reasons of their priuy mallice, Fiercely reuiued againe; each cause yet prou'd but a surmise. Graston fol. 74. Edw. 4. For why? The King and Queene suspected a prophecie fore-tould, Which they immagined would proue to be true; that a G should (Thought to be George Clarence) their nobil progeny supplant. Which soone was verify'd, and prov'd to be true by the tyrrant, That Duke of Gloster; when he was proclam'd a Protector: Who to the Kings children, did proue their sole malefactor. O fond suspitions of mindes? Who can the characters Of futur happes foretell, set downe by celestial orders? Similie.Like as a cockes crowing, or crackling flame of a fy-er, Daunteth a lusty Lyon, which flies for feare of a daunger: So doth a suspition, conceiu'd by the bruit of a tumor, Breed in a Princes mind, but an inward feare, but a terror. Grafton fol. 742. Edw. 4.Some did afirme, this Duke should match with Mary, the daughter Of Charles Duke Burgon: which Edward daily did hinder. Similie.Which was a grief to the Duke, as a sore that festereth inward: For that his owne brother so dealt, that apeard to be for-ward, Thirdly, the cause was aledg'd, that this Duke, George, had a seruant Wrongfuly condemned, that should as a Sorcerer enchant Their regall persons, and their posterity. Wherefore, This Duke complayning to the King, was araign'd as a Traytour: With sory wordes who reuyl'd, and still did murmur against them. Whereby the king, in a rage, this Duke did speedily condemne. There is a time, for a man, both where and when to do wisely: As did apeare by the Duke, who prou'd too daungerus hasty. Silence seldom ofendes: large speach oft stirreth vp anger. Sentence. That wity graue Socrates his schollers charg'd to remember, Maxim. Serm. Three speciall documents; to be shamefast, wise, to be silent: Most requisite for them, that they may proue to be prudent. For let a man see much, let him heare, and say but a littel. Prouerbes. Eor littel meddling doth seldom bring any troubel. As litel hoat sparkels many times do kindel a fy-er Similie. Great, fierce, and violent: So lew'd speech stirreth vp anger, Sore, sharpe, and vehement. And as fire forcibly great streames Vpflaming spreadeth: So lewd wordes enmitie by meanes Endamaging disperse. And as fire quenched is hardly, Similie. Till that it hath burned to the full, and that very fiercely: Whose force doth ruinate, burne and consumeth in ashes Great, large, huge tenements, faire, fine, and sumptuus houses: Semblabel (in like sort) is an anger merciles ardent, Continuing vehement: whose madde rage and fury feruent Doth townes depopulate, subuerteth flatly the citties, Vpturneth castels, murdreth Kinges, and many Princes Stout, wise, and valiaunt. What is it, but mischeuus Enuy Cankereth vp in her hart? To do wrong, she practiceth only: Which she delights most in. With pride she iettes, as a copesmate, Immagining vengeance. Wo worth so spiteful: brewbate. Similie.Better a staf that bendes, than a staf that breaketh asunder: Sentence.Better a man patient, than a man that stirreth vp anger.
