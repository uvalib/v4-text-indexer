      <field name="fulltext">POETICA LICENTIA. A Gratulatory POEM UPON His Majesties Gracious Declaration FOR LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE. With a Friendly Debate betwixt CON and NON. To the KING. So Great! so Universal, and so Free! This was too much (Great CHARLES) except for Thee, For any King to grant, or Subjects hope: Like Thee to do thus, would undo the Pope. Yea, though his Vassals should their Wealth combine To buy Indulgence half so large as Thine: No, if they should not only kiss his Toe, But Clement Podex, He'd not let them goe. Whilst Thou to His Shame, Thy immortal Glory, Hast freed All Souls from real Purgatory; And giv'n All Saints in Heav'n new joys, to see Their Friends in England keep a Jubilee. Suspect us not (Great Sir) nor think the worst; For sudden Joys, like Griefs, confound at first: The splendour of Your Favour was so bright, That yet it dazzles and o'rewhelms our sight. Drunk with Your Cup, my Muse did nothing mind; And until now her feet she could not find: Greediness makes prophane: In the first place Hungry-men fill their belly, then say Grace. We would make Bonfires (SIR) but that we fear Name of Incendiaries we may hear. We would have Musick too, but 'twill not do, For All the Fidlers are Conformists too. Nor can we Ring, the angry Church-man swears, By the King's leave, the Bells and Ropes are Theirs: And let them take them. Yet our Tongues shall sing Your Honour louder than their Clappers ring. But now they tole their Bells, and wring their hands, Religion (that is to say, their Lands) The Protestant Religion now will fall; Bell and the Dragon will devour us all. The Children of the Church are frighted: oh! The POPE's Raw-head-and-bloody-bones cry Boh Behind the door! a License without stint; This bitter Cup hath Roman Wormwood in't. O tender zealous hearts! O sad Condition! Idolatry will eat up Superstition. The Calf at Bethel fears the Calf at Dan; The Gridiron grumbles at the Frying-pan. And now the Jacks have lost their wonted prey, They fear the Pikes will carry them away, So Conjurers grow (toward their end) in fear, That their familiar Devils will them tear. Thus Melancholy Puss mews, and takes on. When Mouse (with which she play'd before) is gone. But Oh ye Champions bring forth and shew The foreskins of those Philistines you slew When in your power; then they favour found; And now you cry, Tiber the Thames will drown'd. But fear not (Gentlemen) if Pop'ry be, You'l find the Nuns are pretty Company. And if the fiery trial should return, Most of you wet your selves too much to burn. Raw men you were, raw still you are, and I So scarce believe you'l carbonado'd die. But let's joyn issue, and go fairly to't, And to a Kings-Bench-Trial put the Suit. The Plaintiff CON: NON-CON Defendant place, This Liberty of Conscience makes the Case. Whither indulging Protestants to teach Freely, and publickly the Gospel preach. “The Prince a Protestant, approved so “By Oath, by Law, by practise, (not in show) “With Premunire, but to mutter No. “But yet exempting Papists from the awe. “(If there were any) of the Penal Law, “Allowing them no publick place at all “Beyond the limits of their private wall. “Whither this be a Trojan-Mare with Fole “Of Pop'ry, by a leap from Rome she stole. In this case Con is Pro, and Non is Con; And now God save the King, and let's fall on. CON. We fear, the Papists will grow proud and swell; Give them an Inch, and they will take an Ell. The Popes Supremacy will soon be Trump, 'Tis he must be the Head, and CHARLES the Rump. NON. The Papists swelling is the way to burst, Let them have Rope enough, and do their worst. And for the Popes Supremacy, Alack! 'Tis but the Bunch upon the Camels back. The Lions skin can't hide the Asse's Luggs, We stamp Pope's faces on our bearded Juggs; And make no more confuting Bellarmine, Then taking off the lusty Ale or Wine. Popes were Kings Chiplins first, their Chaplains next; Choplains at last (by virtue of no Text). To Chop and Change, Chop Logick, Chop off Heads, They became Joves, and Kings their Ganimeds. Thus Peter's Successors like Him deni'd Their Master, but like Him they never cri'd: I wish them like Him Head-long crucifi'd. CON. But oh their Pictures, Agnus Dei's, Pixes, Their lovely Images, and Crucifixes; Their charming-Musick! These are Arts that will Delight the Senses, and by Tickling kill. NON. Our King can Heal, by Stroaking, a Disease: A May-pole and a Fiddle some will please. Fools must have Baubles, Solomon of old To some gave Apes and Peacocks, others Gold. We all know Popes-head-Alley trades in Toyes; Our Merchants come not thither, but our Boys. Our Children with as pretty Babies play, (And make them too) as those to which they pray. And at a shaved Crown dare fling their Jears, Go up thou Bald-head, yet not fear the Bears. CON. Yea, but their learned men will write Ding-dong. And scatter all their Books about e're long. NON. Fear not their Learning; for their Priests I'le swear As arrant Blockheads as your Curates are. One Stilling fleet, one Tillotson of yours; One Baxter, Owen, and one Pool of ours, Can drive their Books and Authors out of door, And you and we have many hundreds more. Let them write Books each day, their Wares are stale, And will not sell, and thereby hangs a Tale: The other day into a place I went, Where Mortals use to go, that want a vent; There by the mouth of Purgatory Hole, Where many groan, and their hard case condole. Saul Cressy's sacred Legend I did find, One leaf whereof gave ease by breaking wind, And wip't Aspersions from Rome behind, Rare Man (cry'd I) worthy to be no less Than Groom o'th' stool unto his Holiness. CON. Oh, but their Jesuits are dangerous men. NON. You mean (like Foxes) when they meet a Hen, Not when they meet a Man: besides the smell Of those Ranck creatures may do very well Against our Palsie and Lethargick Brains, Provided they be few and kept in chains. And should they slip their Chains, and range about, 'Twill make good Shepherds watch the more, no doubt. Though for good Ends we must not evil do; Yet blest be CHARLES, since He hath cry'd, Halloo, Fight Dog, Fight Bear; your Clergie now for shame Leave shooting Pigeons, seek a Nobler Game. Their Churches Paris Gardens are become; And Sundays Sport, to bait the Beast of Rome. God and the King be praised, Now we find That you are of the Nonconformists mind; The Pope is Antichrist, and Rome his Whore; 'Tis hop't you'l never paint nor court Her more: And (what you scoff't us for of old) we hope To hear you sing, Save us from Turk and Pope. And Collects make, pure Worship for Restoring, And saving us from peril of Bull-goring. Now (Brother CON) I'le offer you a Test, Whether you preach in earnest or in jest, Or with some bad design: Let's be Comrades In this good Cause, wee'l serve as Reformades: Let us all join, this head-strong Beast t'assail; Wee'l take him by the Horns, you by the Tail: And when we have Him down, let's make Him sure, And not an Hoof, much less his Calf endure. Let's quench not slack the Fire; Leave ne're a Spark: And spare Him neither Image, Name, nor Mark. Preach Him down Root and Branch; destroy his Kin, Whatever Names or Titles they lurk in. Now since the King gives us fair play, do you; Yours the Black Regiment, and ours the Blew. You'l find, They'l find us work enough for All: Guard you the Temples; We, the School and Hall. Sly Popery (you know) as once it did, May under Gowns, and in Fox-Furrs lie hid. Give us the City-Halls, and we will see That of no Company It shall be Free. If you deny us Halls, I cannot spare you, May you no Kitchins have; and then where are you! CON. Yea, that's the Mischief which we fear indeed, That if we do not work, we shall not feed: 'Twill break our Hearts to Preach! and you'l combine Our Maintenance to share, or undermine. NON. No, if you will not at this Grace repine, Wee'l dress the Vineyard, you shall drink the Wine. Your Church shall be the Mother, ours the Nurse: Peter shall preach, let who will keep the Purse. No Bishops, Parsons, Vicars, Curates, we, But only Ministers desire to be. Wee'l Preach in Sackcloth, you shall Read in Silk; Wee'l feed the Flock, and you shall take the Milk. Let but the Black birds sing in Bushes cold, And may the Jack-daws still the Steeples hold. Wee'l be the Hands to work, the Back to bear; And you the Belly, to devour the Cheer. The Tythe-pig shall be yours; wee'l turn the Spit. Wee'l bear the Cross, you only sign with it. But if the Patriarchs shall envy show To see their younger Brother Joseph go In Coat of divers Colours, and shall fall To rend it cause 'tis not Canonicall: Then may they find him turn a Dreamer too, And live themselves to see his Dreams prove true. May rather they and we together join, In what each can; but they have all the Coin. With Pray'rs and Tears, such service much avails; With Tears to swell our Seas, with Pray'rs our Sails; And with Men too from both our Parties: such I'me sure we have, can cheat or beat the Dutch. Our side a Thousand Quakers well can spare; Nay, Two or Three; for they great Breeders are. The Church can match us with her Jovial Sirs, Informers, Singing-men, and Parritors. Let the King try; set these upon the Decks Together, they will Dutch or Devil vex. Their Breath will mischief far beyond a Gun; And if He lose them, Hee'l not be undone. CON. Oh, but the French with th' English join their Bands To fight against Reformed Netherlands: And when those Papists once the Day have got, We fear poor Protestants will pay the Shot. NON. Now, O the Logick of your Learned Clerks! Piggs play o'th' Organs; Ergo, Cerberus barks: If the Skie fall, down-comes the price of Larks. Our Gallants wear some points fetch't out of France: Ergo, their Errors too we must advance. The Nonconforming Calvinists grow strong; Ergo, We shall be Papists all ere long. Last Warrs the French with Dutch combined were Against the English; Where was then this fear? We have with Holland fought, and fought again, And yet the Articles of Dort maintain. CON. But oh, the Grandees now about the King, They, they procured this Licentious Thing. Some men there be that carry all before 'em; The Duke of Lauderdale is of the Quorum; And George of Buckingham is Dux Malorum. NON. Disloyal Thoughts! Seditious Murmurs these! Tell us whose now are Fears and Jealousies? Harry the Eighth made Monks and Friers sing Their Miserere for such whispering. Are those ill Councellors who do advise Their Prince to grant his people Liberties? To rescue Conscience from Popes at Rome, And from those too who would be such at home. Great Patriots! May Heav'n reward such Peers, And hang such Jewels in their Prince's Ears. May the new Duke, Knight of the Windsor-Garter, (Where many years he lay a Loyal Martyr) Go safe to Scotland, and his Glory shew; They'l find Him and his Ribband both true Blew. May he vye with the Sun, which of them may Enliven Scotland with the Brightest Ray. There may he govern better with a word, Than Oliver with Treacheries and Sword. May the Lord Clifford keep his Noble Name, And his white Soul and Staff support his Fame. May the wise Chanc'lour of th' Exchequer be A greater Treasure than the Treasury. Whether those Silver Streams do ebb or flow, Yet may his Word for Currant Money go. Earl Arlington be a true Craterus, A Lover of the King, belov'd of us: Heav'ns Hand Record his Name, his Hand requite, Who doth our Freedoms both procure and write. Let George-on-Horseback, in despight of CON, Still keep his Saddle, be Hephestion. May the Duke Royal gain immortal Praise, By Granting Olives, or by Winning Bayes. POSTSCRIPT. No, not one word, can I of this Great Deed, In Merlin, or old Mother Shipton read! Old Tyburn take those Tycho Brahe Imps, Astrologers who would be 'counted Pimps To the Amorous Planets; they the minute know When Jove did Cuckold poor Amphytrio. Ken Mars, and Madam Venus winks and glances, Their close Conjunctions, and their mid-night Dances; When costive Saturn goes to Stool, and vile Thief Mercury doth pick his Fob the while; When Lady Luna leaks, and makes her man Throw't out o'th Window into th' Ocean. More subtle than the Excise-men here below, What's spent in every Sign in Heaven they know. Cunning Intelligencers! they'l not miss To tell us next year the success of this; They correspend with Dutch and English Star, As Dow—did with CHARLES and Oliver. The Bankers might have, had they to them gone, What Planet governed the Exchequer, known. Old Lilly though he did not love to make Any words of it, saw Sir Robert take Fiue of the Smyrna Fleet, and if the Sign Had been Aquares, he had made them Nine. When Sagitary took his aim to shoot At Bishop Cosin, he espy'd him do't; And with such force the winged-Arrow flew, Instead of one Church-Stag, he killed two; Glocester and Durham whom he espy'd, Let Lean and Fat together go he cry'd. Well Willy Lilly, thou knew'st this as well As I, and yet wouldst not their Lordships tell. I know thy Plea too, and must it allow, PRELATES should know as much of Heaven as thou: But now Friend William, since 'tis done and past, Pray thee, give us Phanaticks but one Cast, What thou foresaw'st of March the Fifteenth Last; When swift and sudden as the Angels flye, The Declaration came for Liberty; When things of Heaven burst from the Royal Breast, More fragrant than the Spices of the East. I know in next years Almanack thou'lt write, Thou saw'st the King in Council over-night, Before that morn, all sit in Heaven as plain To be discern'd, as if 'twere Charles Waine, Great C, A, B, A, and great L were chief Under C. R. to give poor Fan's relief. Thou sawest Lord Arlington ordain the man To be the first Lay-Metropolitan. Thou saw'st him give induction to a Spittle, And Institute our Brother TOM-DOE-LITTLE. In the Bears Paw, and Bulls right Eye, Some Detriment to Priests thou did'st espye; And though by Sol in Libra thou didst know Which way the Scale of Policy would go; Yet Mercury in Aries did decree, That Wool and Lamb should still Conformists be.
