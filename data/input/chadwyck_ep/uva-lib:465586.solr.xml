      <field name="fulltext">Volume 1.Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. To His Grace, JAMES, Duke of Ormond, &amp;c. Tho. Brown's Epitaph, English'd by Dr. Browne. Near this Place lyes the Remains Of THOMAS BROWN, A Poet not of the least esteem, among the most celebrated; Many of whom, as he was not inferior in Wit, So he excell'd in Learning. To whom, when living, Nature was very liberal, Fortune very sparing. Death itself cou'd not preserve him from Envy, And the Injuries of malicious Men, Whom in his Life-time he fully experienced. He had a luxuriant Wit, And gave the ill-natured World its due; Not as it deserved, but without Punishment. Being an excellent Master of Dialogue, He left many witty Ones, As well as Poems and Letters very Jocose and Merry; Which indeed, though they are wanton, yet they show The Author's Genius. By the like Indulgence of the Muses, The Latin Tongue was as familiar to him as his own. As he was a great Improver of Poetry, He reap'd this Advantage only by it, That being carefully Buried by the Patrons thereof, He Rests among the most Eminent, for Wit and Learning. Go Reader, pursue Wit, and despise Fortune. The Beauties, to Armida. Easie to Love, much easier to Change, Uncircumscrib'd my wanton Passions range. With sure Success each fair Enchanter sets, Toils for my Heart, and spreads her blooming Nets; The faithless Wantan soon a Freedom gains, And from another feels repeated Chains. To every Saint I most devoutly fall, My superstitious Love adores them all; I swear by Love, and by the Pain he brings, My Soul's inconstant as the Wanton's Wings, No lovely Maid cou'd ever fix my Mind, Or all my Heart in Love's soft Circles bind; Too partial Fate, to frame my Soul for Joys, Which my uncertain Temper soon destroys: Whilst for each Fair, successively I burn, My Roving Heart meets no sincere Return. Come then, Great God of Love, and take my Part, And fix for ever my inconstant Heart; Why will you see your faithful Slave abus'd, The pleasing Pain of loving long, refus'd? Why must I make my solemn Vows in vain? I, who your Empire did so well maintain? I, who so far did Loves soft Power extend, And made the Chaste before your Altars bend? Hear but this once with a propitious Ear, And by yourself and Venus Eyes, I swear, A Thousand Offerings each returning Day My grateful Heart shall most devoutly pay; Hear me, Great God, and grant my last Request, Since no Terrestrial Maid can charm my Breast; Make one on purpose, and from every Fair, Some Beauty snatch, to make the Charmer rare: There to begin, whence Love himself does rise, Let her have Sylvia's kind engaging Eyes, In which dear Circles all Incentives move, To cause, confirm, and entertain my Love. His surest Net, there wanton Cupid lays, And as he wounds, about her Eye-balls plays. Sometimes how soft and charming they appear! Sometimes Tyrannick, with a Look severe, They drive the worthiest Lover to Despair. Wisdom and Sense in vain her Victims aid, To break her Chains, too strong her Eyes persuade. Armida's Neck with grateful Motion turn, Where purple Streams in winding Channels run; Next Place, Serena's white enchanting Breast, On which imperial Jove himself might rest; To meet the Touch, those lovely Hills arise, And every Motion does our Sense surprize; But oh! two snowy Mounts so near her Heart, Still keep it cold, and quench Love's hottest Dart; Between those Hills, a Milky Way there leads, Not to the Skies, or the Elizian-Meads, But here's a Path to greater Pleasures shown, For which the Gods have oft forsook their own. Happy's the Man enters this sacred Grove, And treads the Mazes of Mysterious Love. And next, great Love, below this charming Breast, Lesbia's engaging Belly must be plac'd, A Cupulo to thy most awful Shrine, Whence comes your Pow'r, which Mortals make Divine. This is the truest Heliconian Spring, By which inspired Bards first learnt to sing; Venus her Charms, Phœbus his Silver Bow, Jove does his Thunder to the Poets owe. The Gods themselves by their Assistance live, Eternal Fame their deathless Pages give. If more Perfections you expect below, Her Legs and Feet must bright Almeria show. Gods! How she takes me with a vast Surprize! Oh Love, how charming is thy Paradise! Next, over all, must Phryne's Skin be drawn, Lucid and clear as the first Orient Dawn, Thro' which most lovely and unfaithful Screen, The various Passions of the Soul are seen; And all the Tumults of her Virgin Breast, By Fear, Disdain, or softer Love possest. To Laura's Waste, let Lydia's Air invite, A dear Temptation to that strait Delight: From her Apelles might his Pattern take, From her alone a brighter Venus make. Let her, like Cloe, tread an even Pace, And print in every Step she takes, a Grace; May she in Measure, like Clarinda move, And sing as charming as the Saints above. Let Laura's Air in every Act appear, Raising Desire, and yet commanding Fear. And next, great God, that she may nothing want, Of all that I can ask, or you can grant, Let her, Oh let her like dear Claria Kiss Like her transport me with surprizing Bliss. Help me ye Powers of Love, I faint, I die, The Thought screws Nature to a pitch too high, Scarcely my Breast my fleeting Soul retains, And Gusts of Pleasure hurry thro' my Veins. One touch of hers— More Bliss contains than pamper'd Prelates prove In snacht Embraces of forbidden Love. To my last Prayer, propitious Love be kind, And make the Fair bewitching in her Mind, Good Sense and Wit in the same Person joyn'd, Seldom our strictest Inquisitions find; Unite two Stocks to form the witty She, Dorinda's Sense, and Flavia's Repartee. The wanton God smil'd on his humble Slave, As when Adonis he his Mother gave; When strait Heaven's Gates by Love's supream Command, Were open set; for what can Love withstand? Soft breezing Zephyrs bring the Virgin down, A Gift Divine that must my Passion crown; I threw myself devoutly at her Feet, Where all Perfections, all the Graces meet, But by the God commanded to arise, I saw Armida, to my vast Surprize; So rich in Charms, and so divine her Air, The Queen of Love was scarce herself so fair. With eager Arms I clasp'd the lovely Maid, My humble Thanks to mighty Love I paid, And as I wanted nothing else, for nothing pray'd. [Soteria Ormondiana] The same in English, upon the Recovery of the Duke of Ormond. Such cruel Accents, sad Ierne, spare: Cease these untimely Sighs and needless Care, Ormond's recover'd, who for Greatness born, The labouring State protects and does adorn, Ye sacred Domes, where Jove's bright Daughters dwell, The happy Change in lasting Numbers tell. Dublin rejoyce, than whom Apollo more Cythæron loves not, nor the Delian Shore. The conscious Rocks, loud Acclamations reach, And Joys luxurious rend the Ouzie Beech. The Clifts and Hills, my echoed Thoughts rehearse, Applaud my Subject and approve my Verse. Rebellious Croud, sincere Religious Foe, Averse to Kings, and God that made them so, Who pious Frauds, and most Religious Lyes, With better Art than cloystered Priests devise. What Lust of Power, or what nefarious Charms, Ferment your Blood and boil you into Arms, The God of War far from your Thoughts remov'd Nor break his Slumbers with the Queen of Love, By Heavens Command, he is to Health restor'd, Whose prudent Councils or decisive Sword, With gentle Calms this happy Isle shall bless, Shall Foreign Storms and Civil Feuds suppress. E're rising down to shade his Cheeks began His Worth and Actions fully prov'd him Man; His early Youth in Loyal Arms did shine, And drove the vanquish'd Scots beyond the Tyne. Great Pompey thus with Thoughts of Glory fir'd, From Youth's soft Joys and Houshold Gods retir'd, Vanquish'd Numidians by his Arms undone, Ne'er greater Battles lost nor Romans won. Ye tuneful Sisters, who the Ruin know, The dismal Fate of sad Ierne show, Your Sacred Seats by cruel Rage o'erthrown, And Gods exil'd from Temples once their own. Sacred to Arts Eblana, calm Retreat Of Vertue, Science, and the Muses Seat. Oh Shades indulgent to the Poets Dreams! Oh Groves! oh Laurels! oh eternal Streams. In Learning's School, young Wolves and Leopards ran And play'd secure from the Destroyer, Man; Say what hard Fate opprest your Reverend Fame, Then only Ruins, and an empty Name, Whilst Tears of Blood from pale Iverna run, She shews her Wounds to her illustrious Son; Conjures his Aid, and Valour early known, By his Paternal Vertues and his own. To assert her Right, Revenge her cruel Harms, And free his Country by the Force of Arms, The piercing Accents swift as Lightning burn, Consume his Soul, and thro' his Marrow run. Once more, says he, Bellona me invites, To Seas of Blood and execrable Sights. Fain would my Soul the Calms of Peace have try'd, Snatch'd to the Main by the returning Tide, My Sword, Great Charles, and injur'd Virtue draws, The best of Masters, and the justest Cause. Fresh Laurels Fate does for my Brow prepare, Tho' all Mankind oppose the Holy War; Cæsar, to aid, and end Rebellious Strife, He vows his Fortune, Honour, and his Life. Presaging Fires around his Temples shine, The Conscious Omens of a Will Divine, As Lightning swift, or Storms of Hail and Rain, Dreadful as Mars upon the Thracian Plain. To Battel flies, near bright Simois Streams, So look'd the God with such refulgent Beams, What Toils, what Dangers must the Hero run, What Heat endure by a too scorching Sun, Expos'd to Death, which he disdains to shun? The Rebel Troops, no rest his Fire allows, Scourge of their Crimes, and violated Vows, What various Armour spread the purple Fields, What Colours torn, what glitt'ring Helms and Shields? Neglected Horses range along the Plain, Their Chariots broke, and generous Riders slain! Not with Success alone the Hero fought, But also Peace unto his Country brought; That gentle Goddess did serenely smile, And Olive Branches crown'd his finish'd Toil. His Prudence shut fell Janus brazen Doors, And Law and Justice to the State restores. So blest Ierne, when Astræa Reign'd, When Man and Beast one common Shed contain'd. E're impious Ploughs to wound the Earth began, And floating Pines were steer'd by daring Man. Oh! may no Cares disturb the Hero's Life, His happy Hours not intermixt with Strife; May all his Days be white, his Joys serene, And Sorrow only by his Foes be seen. I fear, (may Heaven avert the dire Presage) Juverna's Fortune may embroil his Age; Too much of War his honour'd Worth hath known, Drawing the Sword of Justice and his own. May Fate his Grace late from these Isles remove, To Realms Divine, and Heaven's high Court above. His Mind enlarg'd, and boundless as the Sky, Shall unknown Worlds and Heaven's Recesses spy. The fierce Emotions that disturb Mankind, Our Hopes and Fears that shake the trembling Mind, From thence he'll view, and with Contempt look down, Both on the Pains and Pleasure of a Crown. Thus after all the Toils impos'd by Fate, By angry Gods and conscious Juno's Hate, Divine Alcides breathes Celestial Air, Bless'd with a Goddess ever young and fair. The beginning of the first Satire of Persius imitated. The PROLOGUE, addrest to Mr. Midgly. 'Tis true, nor is it worth Denial, My Verse has never yet stood Trial Of Poetick Smiths that meet still, At Urwin Tom's, or Urwin Will; (For thus, Sir, Modern Revolution Has split the Wits, t'avoid Confusion, And set up Brother against Brother, That they mayn't clapper-claw each other.) That I should think myself a Poet, And vainly dare in Print to shew it: I, who never pass'd, as yet, The Test of the mis-judging Pit, Nor i'th' Galleries tickl'd Crowd, 'Till they have clap'd and laugh'd aloud: Nor from the tender Boxes e'er Yet have drawn one pitying Tear: Nor with Sir Courtly, Roundelays Have made to garnish out new Plays; Nor Virgil's great majestick Lines Melted into enervate Rhimes; Nor witty Horace, e'er did venture To burlesque into modern Banter; Nor gentle Ovid e'er did force To zounds a River for a Horse; Nor, in sharp Juvenal's stronger Verse, Perverted into Dogrel Farce; Nor ever durst, as yet, presume To venture on a meer Lampoon; Nor, in short, few Words being best, E'er could make a bawdy Jest. I'll tell you then, since you'll needs know it, Why I set up now for a Poet; 'Tis not for what most of us write, To fill my Purse, or shew my Wit; But purely out of real Affection, To fill up my Friend's Collection. Therefore, sweet Sir, in haste, adieu t'ye, For I'll adjourn now to my Duty. The beginning of the first Satire of Persius imitated. Poet. Oh the prepostrous Cares of Human Kind! Which in each Action and each Wish we find! Friend. Prithee that Cant give o'er, or who will read? You preach as solemnly, as 'twere your Trade. P. Speak you to me? F. To thee say'st? yes egad— Why surely, Jack, thou'rt absolutely mad, For none will on such formal Verses look, But damn the Author, and despise the Book. P. None, say you, Sir? F. Or one or two at most; And is't not hard to've all your Labours lost? To have your Works on Bulks all dusty lie, And all your Thoughts for want of Readers die? Your precious Lines serv'd up to Nocks, or Pye? P. Mistake not, Friend, I chase not empty Fame, Nor write to please the Town, or get a Name. Let the Vain Herd of noisy Wits and Beaux, To whom they please, their worthless Praise dispose, It ne'er one Moment shall break my Repose. Or what care I, if th'undiscerning Town Prefer dull A? to me, or perter Br?n; Let his tagg'd Nonsense, t'others Wilds of Wit, With Cits and Boys still fond Applauses get: But you, my Friend, steer a securer Course, And by the common Judgment ne'er form yours, Most Men, by publick Vogue, condemn or praise, And never weigh the Merits of the Cause: Let not that Balance you to either side, By Wisdom's Noble Rule, your Sentence guide. Oh! that I could, spight of my beardless Youth, With a prevailing Force, now urge the Truth! F. Stay but a while, till Reverend Age comes on, (Thy fleeting Years of Youth will soon be gone) Then will Grey Hairs on all thou say'st print Awe, A dictatorial Youth does Envy draw, Authority with all thy Precepts go, Tho' from his Pen the noblest Truths do flow. P. Oh! that's too long, I must before that Time, Lash the vile Town with my Satiric Rhime. F. That must not be—pray take a Friend's Advice. P. Prithee no more, indeed thou'rt o'er-nice. I can no longer hold, nor silent see Such numerous Pamphlets on each Quarter fly, Some in Prose, and some in mightier Verse, Which each will daily to his Friends Rehearse. Here a Pert Sot, with six Months Pain brings forth, A strange, mishapen, and ridiculous Birth: A Glimps of Human Stamp it has, the rest Is Serpent, Fish, and Bird, but larger Beast: In that odd Monster Horace once design'd, We may some Method and some Meaning find, Tho' differing Parts, yet distinct Parts it had, Tail of Fish, Horses Neck, a Human Head. Nor Head, nor Tail, nor any Part, is here, Through the whole Lump, no certain Forms appear, 'Tis Chaos all—Mark how the jarring Seed Of ill agreeing Things, perpetual Discord breed Together huddled, now this, now that prevails, HOT Summer now, and now COLD Winters Tales! More pondrous GUESS, with lighter BANTER meets, With clashing Fury each the other greets; MOIST spreading Scandal, with DRY Dulness fights, But oh! 't requires this Mortal Strife to end, A stronger Judgment, a diviner Mind Than his; for whatsoe'er the World may think, Pudding's his Food, and drowsy Mum his Drink: For read his Trifles, and scarce in one Line, You'll find him guilty of the least Design. By the thick Fogs, which from his Diet rise, His Sense is smother'd, and his Judgment dies. Well has he then the Seven Sleepers grac'd, By Yearly Sacrifice, and Annual Feast, For sure his Studies are but Sleep at best; And all the Town must needs be in a Dream, When such wild Ramblings got him some poor Fame. But quitting now this poor Prose Pamphleteer, To mightier Verse I must my Vessel steer. But here the chiming Fops so numerous grow, And in such various Follies dress'd they go, 'T would be an endless Task to lash 'em all, And now I find my Muse grows something dull. F. Enough for one Time, sure is one such Fool. A SATIRE against WOMAN. To a Lady who let a fine Gentleman die for Love of her. Foolish Lucinda, think what is thy due, Since witty Strephon's dead, and dead by you. Think what your Folly, and your Crime demand, Which all your treach'rous Arts cannot withstand. In vain your Eyes with Coquetry you Arm, The false Advances are to me no Charm. I shun the Rock where Strephon has been split, And like Ulysses will serenely sit, Regardless of your Beauty, or your Wit. Thy Syren Sounds, 'tis true, assault my Ear, But the frail Joy's forbid by juster Fear; For while I Strephon's Memory maintain, Your warbling Sounds attack my Soul in vain. When Wit and Honour you in him despise, Your Pertness has no Charm, no Force your Eyes; To Fools and Knaves you are the destin'd Prey, Fate is your Judge, and your Tormenters they. May'st thou a Maid be still, in Thing or Name, Without the Pleasure, may'st thou lose thy Fame, Let lustful Wishes rack thy guilty Mind, Yet no Relief in the Possession find. Let every Man thou seest give new Desires, And not one quench the rank salacious Fires; 'Till the devouring Heat with Envy joyn'd, Rivel thy Body and distort thy Mind; While the Green-sickness, Stone, and loathsome Itch, Consume thy Youth, and burn thee for a Witch. But if it be thy Fate at last to win, Some Wood-cock, Coxcomb, to thy Nuptial Ginn; May thy curs'd Days and Nights be never free, From disappointing Impotence and Jealousy; May that thy Nuptial Pleasures still destroy, And this thy strong Attempts at lawless Joy. Ill Humours, Anger, Drubs, be all thy Lot, And, more to raise thy Pain, be Strephon ne'er forgot His Honour, Love and Merit, haunt thee still, And by lost Joys enhance thy present Ill. But why on thee weak Curses do I spend, For thoughtless Crimes, which come out of thy Kind The Sex are all Pandora's; Mischiefs all, Which only on your foolish Vassals fall, The happy Man, that scorns your idle Charms, Lives most secure from all their racking Harms; While he that yields to your insulting Eyes, Jilted, deceiv'd, betray'd, in Sorrow dies. What lasting Pleasures can from Woman spring, Woman, that various and that changeful Thing? Fleeting and anxious are the Joys we gain, But strong and lasting, as the Cause, the Pain. Who can suppose that Sense shou'd e'er prevail. Where Ignorance and Folly never fail? That Truth and Love success shou'd ever find, In the fantastick Heart of Womankind; All Show themselves, only by Show they're won, And to their Ruin, Truth they're sure to shun, And hug Deceit, by which they are undone. The boisterous Bullies, or the fraudful Knave, The cunning Hypocrite, and cringing Slave, Are sure to gain upon the thoughtless Kind, With ease they vanquish their unguided Mind. Oh! gaudy Source of all Mens Hopes and Fears, Foil of their Youth, and Scandal of their Years; To what vile Crimes dost thou still draw us in? At once the Cause and Punishment of Sin. All their Allurements they with Art display, To cause frail Man to deviate from his Way. Alternate Smiles and Frowns, both insincere, Gay Laughter now, then Sighs, with an ensnaring Tear, Insulting Pride succeeds, and then dissembled Fear. Now sprightly Motion arms her wanton Eye, Then in soft Languishments she'll seem to die, Thus all the unguarded Passes of his Mind she'll try; 'Till vanquish'd by her strong bewitching Charms, He falls a willing Pris'ner to her Arms, There meets a Veng'ance of ne'er ending Harms. To shun this Mischief, know its Vices well, And listen while I all the Sex reveal. Of wild and various Lusts, of Ignorance, Of Avarice strange, and yet profuse Expence; Of superstitious Craft, Profaneness bold, Of windy Nonsense, Follies manifold; Of Cruelty, Inconstancy and Lyes, Envy and Malice, deep Hypocrisies; Of Hate and Anger, and impetuous Rage, That Reason cannot cure, nor Time asswage; Revenge implacable, and lawless Fires, Of impotent, still varying Desires; And of ten Thousand nameless Vices more, Is this vile Idol made, which Men adore. We need not rake the Brothel and the Stews, To see what various Scenes of Lust they use, There the lewd Punks of Want may plead Excuse. But let us to proud Palaces repair, And out of Choice see what is acted there; Where unconstrain'd, by want of Choice they lie Wallowing in all the Filth of boundless Luxury; They set no Limits to their wild Desires, But each possesses what she now admires. Footman and Groom successively they know, The sooty Negro, and the pulvill'd Beau, The brawny Coachman, and the Porter too. Fools of all sorts, with Pleasure they admit, While they palm Virtue on the suing Wit. 'Till cloy'd with Incest and Adultery, To Lusts more strange, with eagerness they fly; The Crimes in Natures Bounds they think too few, And therefore out of Nature seek for new, Lais in Phryne's Arms will now expire, And with strange Art would quench the growing Fire, Still raging with unsatisfy'd Desire. I strive in vain, the varying Crimes to trace, Of this salacious and destructive Race; Let it suffice that I at once declare, No Law can bind them, and no Love endear. Nor shall I hear their drunken Nights unfold, The Tale's too black and shocking to be told; Or how in Gaming they their Hours employ, While thus their Husband's Fortune they destroy; Or pay their Losings with forbidden Joy. Nor shall I touch their secret Murthers done, To hide their Lewdness by Abortion; Or when by Rage and blind Revenge possest, They point Fools Swords against each others Breast. Let it suffice that all the Tales of old, That have of their strange Vices long been told; Pasiphae, Byblis, Phædra, are out-done, By Nymphs more lewd and wicked of our own; For every House in Modern Times can show, Medea and a Massalina too; Quite tired of the nauseous Theme, I end, And quit the Sex for Bottle and for Friend. Celia alone's exempt from all these Crimes, At once the Charm and Honour of these Times. To make this Phenix of the Age divine, Obliging Humour, Wit and Beauty join; No Affectation checks the Joy she gives, For she no Pride from all her Worth derives. If you ask more, to unknown Worlds repair, And try to make the strange Discovery there, For our known World can only boast of her. More than Columbus wou'd thy Search obtain, But cease, the fruitless Toil will be in vain. A Satire on MARRIAGE. The Husband's the Pilot, the Wife is the Ocean, He always in Danger, she always in Motion; And he that in Wedlock twice hazards his Carcass, Twice ventures a Drowning, and Faith that's a hard Case; Ev'n at our own Weapons the Females defeat us, And Death, only Death, can sign our Quietus. Not to tell ye sad Stories of Liberty lost, How our Mirth is all pall'd, and our Pleasure all crost; This Pagan Confinement, this damnable Station, Suits no Order, nor Age, nor Degree in the Nation. The Levite it keeps from Parochial Duty, For who can at once mind Religion and Beauty? The Rich it alarms with Expences and Trouble, And a poor Beast you know, can scarce carry double; 'Twas invented, they tell you to keep us from falling, Oh the Virtue and Grace of a shrill Caterwauling. But it palls in your Game.—Ah, but how do you know, Sir, How often your Neighbour breaks up your Inclosure? For this is the principle Comfort of Marriage, You must eat, though a Hundred have spit in your Porrige. If at Night you're unactive, and fail of performing, Enter Thunder and Lightning, and Bloodshed next Morning. Cries the Bone of your Side, thanks dear Mr. Horner, This comes of your sinning with Crape in a Corner. Then to make up the Breach, all your Strength you must rally, And labour and sweat like a Slave at the Gally. Yet still you must charge, oh blessed Condition, Tho' you know, to your cost you've no Ammunition. 'Till at last my dear mortify'd Tool of a Man, You're not able to make a poor Flash in the Pan. Fire, Female and Flood, begin with a Letter, And the World's for them all not a Farthing the better, Your Flood soon is gone, and your Fire you may humble, If into the Flame store of Water you tumble; But to cool the damn'd Heat of your Wives Titillation, You may use half the Engines and Pumps in the Nation, But may piss out as well the last Conflagration. Thus, Sir, I have sent you my Thoughts of the Matter, Judge you as you please, but I scorn for to flatter. A Satire upon the French King, on the Peace of Reswick. Written by a Non-Swearing-Parson and dropt out of his Pocket at Sam's Coffee-House. Facit indignatio Versum. And hast thou left Old Jemmy in the Lurch? A plague confound the Doctors of thy Church. Then to abandon poor Italian Molly, That I had the firking of thy Bumb with Holly. Next to discard the Prince of Wales, How suits this with the Honour of Versailes? Fourthly and Lastly, to renounce the Turks, Why this is the Devil, the Devil and all his Works. Were I thy Confessor, who am thy Martyr, Dost think that I'd allow thee any Quarter? No—thou shoud'st find what 'tis to be a Starter. Lord! with what monstrous Lyes, and senseless Shamms Have we been cullied all along at Sam's? Who could e're believ'd, unless in Spite, Lewis le Grand wou'd turn rank Williamite? Thou that hast look'd so fierce, and talk'd so big, In thy old Age to dwindle to a Whigg, By Heaven, I see thou'rt in thy Heart a Prigg. I'd not be for a Million in thy Jerkin, 'Fore George thy Soul's no bigger than a Gerkin, Hast thou for this spent so much Ready Rhino? Now, what the Plague will become of Jure Divino? A Change so monstrous, I cou'd ne'er ha' thought, Though Partridge all his Stars to vouch it brought, 'Slife, I'll not take thy Honour for a Groat. Ev'n Oaths with thee, are only Things of Course, Thou, 'Zoons, thou'rt a Monarch for a Horse. Of King's distress'd, thou art a fine Securer, Thou mak'st me Swear, that am a known Non-Juror. But tho' I swear thus, as I said before, Know, King, I'll place it all upon thy Score. Were Job alive, and banter'd by such Shufflers, He'd out-rail Oats, and curse both thee and Bufflers. For thee I've lost, if I can rightly scan 'em, Two Livings worth full Eightscore Pounds per Annum, Bonæ, &amp; legalis Angliæ Monetæ, But now I am clearly routed by the Treaty. Then Geese and Pigs my Table ne'er did fail, And Tythe-Eggs merrily flew in like Hail, My Barns with Corn, my Cellars cramm'd with Ale. The Dice are chang'd, for now, as I'm a Sinner, The Devil, for me, knows where to buy a Dinner. I might as soon, tho' I were ne'er so willing, Raise a whole Troop of Horse, as one poor Shilling, My Spouse alas! must flaunt in Silks no more, Pray Heav'n, for Sustenance, she turn not Whore; And Daughter Peggy too, in time, I fear, Will learn to take a Stone up in her Ear. My Friends have basely left me with my Place, What's worse, my very Pimples bilk my Face. And frankly my Condition to disclose, I most resent th'ungratitude of my Nose, On which, tho' I have spent of Wine such store, It now looks paler than my Tavern Score. My double Chin's dismantled, and my Coat is, Past its best Days, in Verbo Sacerdotis. My Breeches too this Morning, to my Wonder, I found grown Schismaticks, and fallen asunder. When first I came to Town with Houshold Clog, Rings, Watch, and so forth, fairly went for Prog. The Ancient Fathers next, in whom I boasted, Were soon exchang'd for primitive boil'd and roasted. Since 'tis no Sin, of Books to be a Glutton, I truck'd St. Austin for a Leg of Mutton. Old Jerom's Volumes next I made a Rape on, And melted down that Father for a Capon. When these were gone, my Bowels not to baulk, I trespass'd most enormously in Chalk. But long I had not quarter'd upon Tick, E're Christian Faith, I found, grew monstrous sick: And now, alas! when my starv'd Entrails croke, At Partner How's I dine, and sup on Smoke. In fine, the Government may do its Will, But I'm afraid my Guts will grumble still. Dennis, of Sicily, as Books relate, Sir, When he was tumbled from the Regal State, Sir, (Which, by the bye, I hope will be your Fate, Sir.) And his good Subjects left him in the Lurch, Turn'd Pedagogue, and tyranniz'd in Birch: Tho' thus the Spark was taken a Peg lower, Some feeble Signs of his old State he bore, And Reign'd o'er Boys, that govern'd Men before. For thee I wish some Punishment that worse is, Since thou hast spoil'd my Prayers, now hear my Curses. May thy Affairs, (for so I wish by Heavens) All the World o'er at Sixes lie and Sevens. May Conti be impos'd on by the Primate, And forc'd, in haste, to leave the Northern Climate; May he rely upon their Faith, and try it, And have his Belly full of Polish Diet. With Maintenon, tho' thou so long hast kept her, May Brand Venereal singe thy Royal Scepter. May all the Poets, that thy Fame have scatter'd, Un-god thee now, and damn what once they flatter'd. May Pope and thou be never Cater-Cousins, And Fistula's thy Arse-hole seize by Dozens. Thus far in Jest; but now to pin the Basket, May'st thou to England come, of Jove I ask it, Thy wretched Fortune, Lewis, there to prop, I hope thou'lt in the Friars take a Shop, Turn Puny-Barber there, bleed lousy Carmen, Cut Corns for Chimney-Sweepers, and such Vermin, Be forc'd to Trim (for such I'm sure thy Fate is) Thy own Hugonots, and us Non-Jurors, gratis. May Savoy with thee hither pack, And carry a Rare-Show upon his Back. May all this happen, as I've put my Pen to't, And may all Christian People say Amen to't. Being committed for the foregoing Satire, he wrote the following Petition to the Lords in Council Assembled, by which he receiv'd his Enlargement from Prison. PINDARICK. Humbly Sheweth, Shou'd you order Tho. Brown, To be whip'd thro' the Town, For scurvy Lampoon, Grave S?n and Crown, Their Pens wou'd lay down. Even Durfey himself, and such merry Fellows, That put their whole Trust in Tunes and Trangdilloes, May hang up their Harps and themselves on the Willows, For if Poets are punish'd for libelling Trash, John Dryden, tho' Sixty, may yet fear the Lash, No Pension, no Praise, Much Birch without Bays, These are not right Ways, Our Fancy to raise, To the writing of Plays, And Prologues so witty, That jirk at the City, And now and then hit, Some Spark in the Pit, So hard and so pat, 'Till he hides with his Hat, His monstrous Cravat, The Pulpit alone, Can never preach down, The Fops of the Town. Then pardon Tho. Brown, And let him write on; But if you had rather, convert the poor Sinner, His foul Mouth may be stop'd with a Dinner; Give him Cloaths to his Back, some Meat, and much Drink, Then clap him close Prisoner without Pen and Ink, And your Petitioner shall neither Pray, Write, nor Think. THOMAS BROWN. A Satire upon an ignorant Quack, that murder'd a Friend's Child, and occasion'd the Mother, upon the News of it, to Miscarry. Tho' 'twas thy Luck to cheat the fatal Tree, Thanks to the partial Herd that quitted thee; And, to the lasting Scandal of our Times, Thou'rt still reserv'd to act anew thy Crimes, Think not to 'scape the Justice of my Rhimes. Th'impartial Muse, in pointed stabbing Verse, Shall all thy several Villanies rehearse; With Wreaths of Henbane she'll adorn thy Head, She'll hunt thee Living, and she'll plague thee Dead. Base sordid Monster! Mercenary Slave! Thou Church-Yard Pimp, and Pander to the Grave, Death's busy Factor, Son of Desolation, Thy Country's Curse, and Grievance of the Nation. Thou motly Lump of Ignorance and Pride, In all the scoundrel Arts of Killing try'd; How shall I tell thy Guilt, or how begin To lash a Villain crusted o'er with Sin? Sure in some Powder-mill, that hot-brain'd Sot Thy Father in the Dog-days thee begot; And some She-Bear, in horrid Woods alone, Suckled thee young, and nurst thee for her own. Hence thy sour brutal Temper first began, The Beast was thinly plated with the Man. No Beams of softning Pity touch thy Breast, Too vile a Cell to harbour such a Guest. Oh hadst thou liv'd in that curst Tyrant's Reign, By whose Command the Innocents were slain, Herod might then have sav'd his Men the Pains, At Bethlem to knock out the Children's Brains. Thy Pills alone the fatal Work had done, And soon dispatch'd them, every Mother's Son. Why with our Laws, vain Volumes do we fill, If such as thou have privilege to kill? Mean, lousy Felons, for less Crimes by far Have oft receiv'd their Sentence at the Bar: I'th' Face of Day, thou robb'st us of our Health, And yet art never question'd for the Stealth. Sure some dire Planet all thy Steps pursues, Name All-kill, and a Sickness strait ensues. Thro' thy destroying Skill Diseases reign, Nor did a Blacksmith teach thee first in vain; Not Sword, nor Plague, nor Famine ravage more, Thou kill'st, and Fate has hardly Time to score. Death, tho' unsought, waits on thy murdring Quill, Attends each Dose, and lurks in every Pill. With little Pains, and very little bribing, Whole Nations might be kill'd by thy prescribing. But know, dull Sot, the dreadful Hour's at Hand, When before aweful Justice thou must stand. The Muse her ancient Freedom does assume, Then tremble, while she thus proclaims thy Doom. For Grubstreet Doggrel furnish out a Tale, And be the Jest of Midwives o'er their Ale: For Scalded Heads, most learnedly advise, And in the Case of Kibes, seem monstrous wise: Be ne'er consulted 'bove a Boil or Blister, And to my Lady's Lap-Dog give a Glister. If thou hast a mind to pick up nasty Pence, Set up for Farrier in thy own Defence. Cure Hogs of Measles, visit labouring Swine, And order Doses for thy Neighbour's Kine. Reign over Beasts from Bersheba to Dan, But never, never meddle more with Man. May none seek Help from thy damn'd Remedies, But senseless Brutes that Health and Fame despise. But Sots, on whom each canting Fool imposes, And Carted Bawds, and Strumpets without Noses, Be the most scorn'd Jack-Pudding in the Pack, And turn Toad-eater to some foreign Quack. Gout, Pox, and Stone, with all attending Ills, Thou hast so often threatned in thy Bills, Thee, with fresh Rage incessantly devour, And leave their pointed Darts in every Pore. Let them with Force united make thee smart, And own thy self a Blockhead in thy Art, From these insulting Tyrants find no Quarter, Put to thy own Prescriptions fall a Martyr. On thy vile self the baleful Potions try, Then damn old Galen, and by piece-meal die. But let no Fever, (for I'll once be kind) Or Pestilence to thee admission find; Those generous Foes too soon conclude their Rage, I'd have thee tortur'd for at least an Age. May all that Malice, fruitful to torment, All that Revenge of Priesthood can invent; All that on Earth despairing Wretches fear, Light on thy Head, and kindly center there. Mark'd with Heaven's Stamp, like Adam's murdring Son, Thro' the whole Globe, a branded Villain run, And all Mankind the raving Monster shun. Despis'd, abandon'd rove from Pole to Pole, Thy Carcass jaded by thy restless Soul. Where-e'er thou goest, a Mother's Curses meet, Pale Nurses thee with Execrations greet, And wrinkled Witches, when they truck with Hell Invoke thy Name, and use it for a Spell. Blaspheming leave the World, and never know, The least remitting Interval from Woe. Dire Conscience all thy guilty Dreams affright, With the most solemn Horrors of the Night, The Screams of Infants ever fill thy Ears, And injur'd Heaven be deaf to all thy Vows and Prayers. Thus have I eas'd in part my wrathful Spleen, Nor canst thou say the Muse has been too keen. What-e'er the fiercest Satire can inspire, Falls vastly short of what thy Crimes require. What Punishment can too severe be thought For thee, by whom such num'rous ills are wrought? The Living sent to an untimely Tomb, And unborn Infants murder'd in the Womb. For seiz'd with Grief, that by thy fatal Aid Her much wrong'd Child was of its Life betray'd, The expiring Parent, whom scarce Art could save, Paid an untimely Tribute to the Grave. To what degree do Quacks like thee, annoy, Who can ev'n Life, before it comes, destroy? An Inscription upon a Tobacco-Box. By Dr. Spratt, Bishop of Rochester. An Imitation of it in English. By Mr. Brown. When with rank Poison Heaven equipt Pandora, She ope'd the Box like a confounded Whore-a, And of Diseases strait flew out a Score-a. But now, since Jove, like a good-natur'd Brother, Gives us the Indian Weed to funk and smother, One Box has made Attonement for another. To a Young Lady, who appeared frequently leaning out of her Chamber Window. When Venus naked from the Sea arose, She did not half so many Charms expose, Nor when for the decisive Fruit she strove, Shew'd Paris half so rich a View of Love: Nay, when she clasp'd Adonis in her Arms, The melting Goddess had not half your Charms: Less firm her snowy Breast, her Skin less white, Her lovely Limbs less tempting to Delight. How shall we then express those Charms below, Which you and Nature both forbear to show? So fair an Hostess, and so fair a Sign, Would force a Trade, and recommend bad Wine. Water from such a Spring is sweeter far, Than all the Clusters of the Vintage are, Let Bacchanalians and the empty Beaux, Hunt out Champain, Burgundy, and Bourdeaux. To fetch some Drops from that dear shady Well, Wou'd all the Nectar of the Gods excell. Your Eyes assure us that you can dispense Peculiar Joys for each peculiar Sense; Then having let us see, pray let us taste Those dear conceal'd Delights below the Waste; 'Twere Madness to expect to keep ones Heart, When Cupid lies intrench'd in every Part. How shall we guard our Freedom from Surprize, When your least Charms are in your conquering Eyes? Upon a Lady's being disappointed by a young Scotch Lord. I Young Caledon has all the Charms That can engage the Fair, A Tongue that every Heart disarms, A soft bewitching Air. But see what Fate attends a Drone! He loses what he takes, And when the Fortress is his own His Victory forsakes. II At her Expence this fatal Truth, Melissa late did prove, Neither her Beauty nor her Youth Could long secure his Love; The lavish Hero fir'd too fast, So vain was his Ambition, That when three poor Attacks were past, He wanted Ammunition. III Were it Inconstancy alone, Art might the Youth reclaim; But when Love's vital Oyl is gon, What can revive the Flame? Ye Gods, by whom my Hopes are curst, Once grant me what I pray, Give Caledon less Heat at first, Or better Funds to pay. The Temperate Epicure, written by that Celebrated Wit of France, Monsieur la Fountaine, when troubled with a Rheumatism. Imitated in English by Mr. Tho. Brown. Since my Day's spent so near the Night, Why shou'd I beat my Brains to write? 'Tis better far with prying Look, To read the World's amazing Book, And Nature's mystick Springs to know, And the vast Mind that does bestow Motion and Life on all below. When this is done, what should deny To take our fill of harmless Joy? Joy we may taste a thousand Ways, And still find something new to please: Whether by some cool River's side, We see the silver Waters glide, The Fishes sport, and Sun-beams gay, On the smooth liquid Surface play; Or seek some lonely Sylvan Shade, Or glimmering Bower, or russet Glade, Where the dark Horrors of the Wood Solemn Thoughts inspire and good. Sometimes at Table, when we dine, We may dissolve our Cares in Wine, And o'er the generous Nectar sport, And laugh at City and at Court: And sometimes too a new Amour, May serve to pass an idle Hour. Long with the Fair we must not stay, But from the Charmers part away. Love does unseen the Flame impart, And finds a Passage to the Heart. But is it not alas high Time, To chase the Cœlia's from my Rhime, When the grave City is preparing To give our Damsels He means the Magistrates of Paris, who had ordered that all convicted Whores should be transported to the West-Indies, Indian Airing. Oh! that my persecuting Pain, Would with these Ladies cross the Main, And never visit me again! Cruel Disease! old Saturn's Son, Quit this Abode and get thee gon. Some lazy Prelate's Limbs invade, Or Lawyer's batt'ning on his Trade; Or with thy dire Attendants wait On some dull Minister of State; But why, thy Visits never timing, Should'st thou intrude to spoil my Rhiming? The Devil a Verse can from me creep, But shews what Company I keep. If this be thy felonious Aim, To chill my Muse, and damp her Flame, Prithee to some new Host repair, And all this needless trouble spare: In few Months more, without thy Aid, Old Age will spoil me for that Trade. An Epigram upon Sir R. B. Such swarms of Wits on Blackmore; most absurd! Two Thousand Flies attack a new-fall'n T?, In which great Fray, each unsuccessful Fly Loses his Sting, beshits his little Thigh: From whence this useful Moral's clearly shown, Better the Fly had let the T? alone. An EPIGRAM. [A Saph takes the wisest Course] A Saph takes the wisest Course, To prop three sinking Nations: For Partridge only bribes the Stars, But he the Revelations. On a Blind Man in Love. If Argus with a Hundred Eyes, not one Could guard, hop'st thou to keep thine, who hast none? On the TAX upon SALT. The Emblem o'th' Nation, so Grave and Precise, On the Emblem of Wisdom have laid an Excise: Pray tell me, grave Sparks, and your Answer don't smother, Why one Representative Taxes another? The Commons on Salt a new Impost have laid, To Tax Wisdom too, they most humbly are pray'd; For tell me ye Patrons of Woollen and Crape, Why the Type shou'd be fin'd, and the Substance escape? The Pleasures of LOVE. A SONG. I How quickly are Love's Pleasures gone! How soon are all its mighty Triumphs done! In vain, alas, do we the Banquet taste, Whose Sweets as swift as Thought are past! In vain do we renew the Fight, Who at the first Alarms are basely put to Flight! II Happy Great Jove, who in Alcmæna's Arms, For three full Nights enjoy'd Love's Charms! Nature turn'd Bawd, her Monarch to Obey, And Pimping Darkness shut out Day. Whilst in vast Joys the half-spent God did Sweat Joys, as his Lightning fierce, and as his God-Head great! III Bravely begun the Feat! Oh had it mounted higher, Fed still with vigorous Heat and fresh Desire! Were I but he, my boundless Reign shou'd prove But one continu'd Scene of Love. In Extasies I would dissolving lie, As long as all the mighty Round of vast Eternity. Cupid turn'd Tinker. I Fair Venus, they say, On a Rainy Bleak Day, Thus sent her Child Cupid a packing: ‘Get thee gone from my Door, ‘Like a Son of a Whore, ‘And elsewhere stand bouncing and cracking. II To tell the plain Truth, Our little blind Youth Beat the Hoof a long while up and down, Sir: Till all Dangers past, By good Fortune, at last He stumbl'd into a great Town, Sir. III Then strait to himself Crys this tiny sly Elf, Since Begging brings little Relief, Sir: A Trade I'll Commence That shall bring in the Pence; And so he set up for a Thief, Sir. IV At Play-House and Kirk, Where he slily did lurk, He stole Hearts both from young and old People; Till at last, says my Song, He had like to have swung On a Gallows as high as a Steeple. V Then with Arrows and Bow, He a Soldier must go, And straight he shot Folks without Warning. He thought it no Sin When his Hand was in, To kill you a Hundred each Morning. VI When he found that he made Little Gains by his Trade, What does our sly graceless Blinker? But straight chang'd his Note, As well as his Coat, And needs he must pass for a Tinker. VII Have yo' any Hearts to mend? Come, I'll be your Friend, Or else I'll expect not a Farthing: Tho' they're burnt to a Coal, I'll soon make 'em whole; And, Maids, is not this a fair Bargain? VIII But, Maids, have a care, Of this Tinker beware, Shun the Rogue, tho' he sets such a Face on't. Where he stops up one Hole, 'Tis true, by my Soul, He'll at least leave a Score in the Place on't. The General LOVER. In all Love's Dominions I challenge the Boy, To shew such a forward frank Lover as I, So faithful and true where my Promise is past, At the first so sincere, and so warm at the last. Imprimis, I've sworn true Allegiance to Phillis, And the same I have done to divine Amarillis. Then to Cælia the fair, I my Heart did resign, Next I laid down the Trifle at Iris's Shrine. Calista then gently put in for the Prize, Nor did the coy Sylvia my Offering despise. But now you'll enquire, can they all quarter there? Why, Madam, my Heart's large enough, never fear. There's room for my Phillis, And soft Amarillis: And Cælia the Fair, Who need not despair Of a good Lodging there: With Iris, Calista, and Sylvia beside. Yes, Madam, this oft by Experience I've try'd. So large is the Place, and so plenteous my Store, I with ease can provide for six Mistresses more, Nay, if you distrust me, e'en send me a Score. A Tale from Bocas, or a Cure for Cuckoldom. Too weak are Laws, and Edicts vain, The Hearts of Women to restrain; For when with happy Search they find, The Man they like, they still are kind. So strong, so daring is their Love, It does ev'n Fear of Death remove, For proof of this, if others fail, I now design to tell a Tale. At Prato, once upon a Time, Adultery was thought a Crime: And every kind consenting Wife, Was doom'd by Law to lose her Life; So partial was this horrid Act, It equally condemn'd the Fact, Whether the Cause was pure Desire, Or sordid Gain and sinful Hire, No sooner did this Edict pass, But one Rinaldo found (alas) His Wife Philippa, fam'd for Charms, In lusty Lazarino's Arms. And with Revenge and Fury fill'd, 'T was ten to one he both had kill'd; But eager Passion he restrain'd, The bold Adulteress arraign'd, And to the Podestate complain'd. The Judge for Tryal nam'd the Day, And gave her Time to slip away; But she resolv'd to stand it out, In vain her Kindred went about, By dire Descriptions of the Law, To fright and force her to withdraw; She minded not a Word she heard, One wou'd have sworn, by what appear'd, She thought her Fate wou'd glorious prove, To suffer Martyrdom for Love. When solemn Day of Tryal came, In Court appear'd the Guilty Dame, But look'd as cheerful, brisk and gay, As those that Ogle at a Play. The Judge was in a horrid fright, (Touch'd to the Quick by Charms so bright) Lest she the Matter shou'd confess, Her Case would then be past Redress. You must be burnt, Madam, he said, Your Spouse has Information made, That you were lately caught by him, Committing the forbidden Crime, Adultery, and doubtless you Have heard for this what Death is due. Consider what you have to say, And prudently your Answer weigh, She said, I freely own the Fact, He caught me in the very Act; With Joy the pleasing Word I name, For know, I glory in my Flame; And since my Passion did begin, Have often try'd the tempting Sin. For this you say I ought to die, But you know better, Sir, than I, That Laws for Publick Justice meant, Should pass'd by general Consent; And pray what Woman did appear To Vote for this? I ne'er could hear Of one that lik'd it; and 'tis hard They should unjustly be debarr'd Their Native Right, by a Decree, To which they never did agree; On us alone, Restraint is laid, Who are by bounteous Nature made To give Content to more than one, Which never yet by Man was done. If Prejudice did not prevail, Your solid Wisdom cou'd not fail For me this Matter to decide, And to declare the Edict void. But, Sir, if Death must be my Doom, Soon let the welcome Minute come; Secure, I wait the fatal Blow, Yet first an easy Favour show. Pray ask my Husband, there he stands, If all his Conjugal Demands Have not been answer'd still by me, With an exact Conformity? Rinaldo said, I must confess, My Wife did still comply in this; Inclin'd my wish'd Desires to grant, And fond to satisfy my Want. Observe, Sir, that, Phillipa said, Whate'er he wanted, still he had; Then wherefore, pray, this mighty pother, If I, to gratify another, Imploy'd the useless Residue! Pray, Husband, what was that to you? I, like a Charitable Fair, Bestowing what I had to spare, Believ'd it better to improve My growing Overplus of Love, Than suffer envious Marriage-Bands To keep it dead upon my Hands. Her Speech so pleas'd the listning Crowd, They clap'd their Hands, and laugh'd aloud. Rinaldo durst no longer stay, But hid his Face, and sneak'd away; And fair Philippa, by her Art, So brib'd the Court to take her Part, So to her side the Judge did draw, She sav'd herself, and damn'd the Law. The Highlander, a Satire. From barren Highlands, in the freezing North, The Bonny Lad with naked Feet, steps forth; With lousy Plad his scabby Loins he hides, And measures out his Miles by Spanish Strides; He cocks his Bonnet, as he proudly stalks, And scrubs his mangy Knuckles as he walks; Athwart his Buttocks hangs a mighty Blade Of sturdy Steel, for Blood and Slaughter made; Broad as the Sword the English Champion drew, When he to save the Maid, the Dragon slew. Mundungus Wisps within his Jaws he puts, As Monkeys their Alforges stuff with Nuts: Thus on Tobacco does he hourly feed, And plumps his freckly Cheeks with stinking Weed. Then with the poisonous Drivil that distills From the rank Leaf his leprous Joints he heals; Does with great Care the fluxing Ointment catch, To ease the Curse of an incessant Scratch; For what poor Mortal would the Mange endure, Whose unctious Lungs afford a nauseous Cure. No matter, beastly Remedies are best For those that are with beastly Plagues opprest; The skilful Country Farrier will allow, A T?d's a healing Balsam for a Sow; From whose vile Sloth and Filthiness accrue, More odious Plagues than Egypt ever knew. When the stew'd Sotweed in his Mouth has lain So long, till spitting does its Virtues drain; Then out he turns the Pledges, lays it by, Till in the Sun the wreaking Wisp grows dry. Then filling his short Pipe, he blows a Blast, And does the burning Weed to Ashes wast, Which when it's cool, he snushes up his Nose, That he no part of his Delight may lose; Thus chews it first, next smoaks the same, and then Snuffs up the stinking Ashes that remain. Thus wasteful Spendthrifts to their Shame may see, The Caledonian Loon's Frugality; And learn from him, against a Time of need, To husband Wealth, as Sawny does his Weed. Innur'd to Hardships, proudly he disdains The frosty Winds, deep Snows and show'ry Rains; And with a Bag of Otmeal for his Food, To give the Loon Refreshment on the Road, And a hard Oynion; thus he steers his Course, Values no Mire, but travels like a Horse; And when his craving Thirst or Hunger calls For due Subsistance, on his Knees he falls, And in the Impression of a Hobby's Hoof, Where Rain lies mix'd with other nasty Stuff, He drops his Oatmeal, stirs it well about, And leaning on his Hands, sucks up the Grout; Then jogs away with a contented Mind, Leaving his dirty Porridge-dish behind; And when thus strengthen'd, by this poor Relief, Will tire an English Boor well fed with Beef. Thus with unweary'd Pains he runs or trots, Like mettled Nag, by virtue of his Oats; Therefore since Sawny does like Dobbin feed, Why should we wonder at their equal Speed. Proud of his Ancestors, he boasts his Name, And tells you of what Clan the Vassal came; Draws his broad Sword, which has such Vict'ries won, And reads long Lectures of the Feats 't'as done; Then sheaths the massy Weapon, snuffs and struts, With mangy Paws, full Mouth, but empty Guts. Where-e'er he ligs, his scabby Fumes and Sweats, Pollute the Chamber, and infect the Sheets; And whosoe'er succeeds him in his Room, Brimstone and Lard must surely be his Doom. His very Breath infects the wholsome Air, And as he travels, does the Itch transfer. So that nice Beaus and Merchants upon Change, Shun the Scotch-Walk, thro' danger of the Mange; A Curse that Heaven has alone decreed, To plague this barbarous Caledonian Breed; Whose Pride and Poverty has made each Slave Grow bold and desperate, which himself calls Brave. So Rogues mistaking Scandal to be Fame, Deem that their Honour, others think their Shame. An Epigram, occasion'd by the News that Sir R? Bl?re's Paraphrase upon Job was in the Press. When Job contending with the Devil I saw, It did my Wonder, but not Pity, draw; For I concluded that, without some Trick, A Saint at any time could match Old Nick. Next came a fiercer Fiend upon his Back, I mean his Spouse, stunning him with her Clack; But still I could not pity him as knowing A Crabtree-cudgel soon woold send her going. But when the Quack engag'd with Job, I 'spy'd; The Lord have Mercy on poor Job, I cry'd. What Spouse and Satan did attempt in vain The Quack will compass with his murd'ring Pen, And on a Dunghil leave poor Job agen. With impious Doggrel he'll pollute his Theme, And make the Saint against his Will blaspheme. Upon the Knighting Sir R? B?re, for his incomparable Poem call'd King Arthur. Be not puff'd up with Knighthood, Friend of mine, A merry Prince once Knighted a Sir-Loin. And, if to make Comparisons were safe, An Ox deserves it better than a Calf. Thy Pride and State I value not a Rush, Thou that art now Knight Phyz, wast once King Ush. Upon King Arthur, partly writ in the Doctor's Coach, and partly in a Coffee-House. Let the malicious Criticks snarl and rail, Arthur immortal is, and must prevail. In vain they strive to wound him with their Tongue, The Lifeless Fœtus can receive no wrong. As rattling Coach once thunder'd thro' the Mire, Out dropt Abortive Arthur from his Sire. Well may he then both Time and Death defy, For what was never born, can never die. Upon seeing a Man light a Pipe of Tobacco in a Coffee-House with a Leaf of King Arthur. In Coffee-House begot, the short-liv'd Brat By Instinct thither hasts to meet his Fate. The Phœnix to Arabia thus returns, And in the Grove that gave her Birth, she burns. Thus wand'ring Scot, when through the World he'as past, Revisits ancient Tweed with pious haste, And on Paternal Mountain dies at last. Epigram, occasion'd by the Passage in the Satire against Wit, that reflects upon Mr. Tate, and ends thus: He's honest, and, as Wit comes in, will pay. Rail on, discourteous Knight: If modest Tate Is slow in making Payments, what of that? So is th'Exchequer, so are half the Lords, On whom thou hast bestow'd such sugar'd Words. Envy itself must own this Truth of Mr. Tate's Christian Name. Nahum, That when the Muses call, he strives to pay 'em. But can we this of thy damn'd Hackney say, Who as she nothing has, can nothing pay? Then be advis'd, rail not at Tate so fast, A Psalm of his may chance to be thy last. A Story of a Greek Chevalier, Predecessor in a direct Line to the British Knight. When fir'd with Glory, Philip's Godlike Son The Persian Empire like a Storm o'er-run, A worthless Scribbler, Cherilus by Name, In pompous Doggrel, soil'd the Hero's Fame; The Grecian Prince, to Merit ever just, (For Monarchs did not then Reward on Trust) Read o'er his Rhimes, and to chastise such Trash, Gave him for each offending Line a Lash. Thus Bard went off, with many Drubs requited, That's in plain English, Cherilus was Knighted. To Elkanah Settle, the City-Poet. Wilt thou then passive see the Sacred Bays Torn from thy Brows in thy declining Days, And tamely let a Quack usurp thy Place, So near Guild-Hall, and in my Lord-Mayor's Face? Rouze up for shame, assert thy ancient Right, And from his City-Quarters drive the Knight. Let Father Two famous City Poets. Jordan Martial Heat inspire, And Unkle Two famous City Poets. Taubman fill thy Breast with Fire. If Bl?re cries, both Arthurs are my own, Quote thou the fam'd Cambyses, and Pope Joan. Cheapside at once two Bards can ne'er allow; But either he must abdicate, or thou. Then if the Knight still keeps up his Pretence, E'en turn Physician in thy own Defence. 'Tis own'd by all the Criticks of our Time, Thou canst as well Prescribe, as Bl?re Rhime. To the Author of the Satire against Wit, upon concealing his Name. He that in Arthur's Trash has Penance done, Need not be told who writ this vile Lampoon; In both the same eternal Dulness shines, Inspires the Thoughts, and animates the Lines; In both the same lewd Flattery we find, The Praise defaming, and the Satire kind. Alike the Numbers, Fashion, and Design, No Chequer-Tallies could more nicely join. Thy foolish Muse puts on her Mask too late, We know the Strumpet by her Voice and Gate. On Job newly travestied by Sir R? B?re. Near Lethe's Banks, where the forgetful Stream With lazy Motion creeps, seeming to dream, Job, with his thoughtful Friends, discoursing sate, Of all the dark mysterious Turns of Fate; And much they urg'd why Heaven's partial Care, The Good should punish, and the Bad did spare; When, lo! a Shade, new landed, forward prest, And thus himself to list'ning Job addrest. Illustrious Ghost! (I come not to upbraid) Oh! summon all thy Patience to thy Aid; A Cheapside Quack, whose vile unhallow'd Pen, With equal Licence murders Rhimes and Men, In tumbling Fustian has burlesqued thy Page, And fam'd Jack Dunton brings it on the Stage. Was ever Man, the patient Job did cry, So plagu'd with cursed Messengers as I? All other Losses unconcern'd I bore, But never heard such stabbing News before. Who can behold the Issue of his Brain Mangled by barbarous Hands, and not complain? This scribbling Quack (his Fame I know too well By Thousand Ghosts, whom he has sent to Hell) Dull Satan's feebler Malice will refine, And stab me thro' and thro' in every Line. The Devil, more brave, did open War declare; The fawning Poet kills, and speaks me fair. Curs'd be the Wretch that taught him first to write, And with lewd Pen and Ink indulg'd his Spight; That fly blow'd the young Bard with buzzing Rhimes, And fill'd his tender Ears with Grubstreet Chimes. Curs'd be the Paper-mill his Muse employs, Curs'd be the Sot who on his Skill relies. Thus Job complain'd; but to forget his Grief, In Lethe's Sov'raign Streams he sought Relief. To Sir R? B?re, upon his unhappy Talent of Praising and Railing. Thine is the only Muse in British Ground Whose Satire tickles, and whose Praises wound. Sure Hebrew first was taught her by her Nurse, Where the same Word is us'd to bless and curse. On Sir R? B?re's Project to erect a Bank of Wit. The Thought was great, and worthy of a Cit, In present Dearth t'erect a Bank of Wit. Thus breaking Tradesmen, ready for a Jayl, Raise Millions for our Senate o'er their Ale. But thou'rt declar'd a Bankrupt, and thy Note E'en in old Grub-street scarce could fetch a Groat. Apollo scorns the Project, and the Nine With Indignation laugh at thy Design. There's not a Trader to the Sacred Hill, But knows thy Wants, and would protest thy Bill. Thy Credit can't a Farthing there command, Tho' Freake and Rimer should thy Sureties stand. To Sir R? B?re, on the two Wooden Horses before Sadlers-Hall. As trusty Broomstaff Midnight Witch bestrides. When on some grand Dispatch of Hell she rides; O'er gilded Pinacles and lofty Towers, And tallest Pines with furious haste she scowres, Out-flies in her Career the lab'ring Wind, And sees spent Exhalations lag behind; Arriving at the black Divan at last, In some dire Wood, or solitary Wast, The Fiend her cheated Senses does delude With airy Visions of imagin'd Food; Ev'n so, on Wooden Prancer mounted high, Your Muse takes nimble Journeys in the Sky; When in her boldest Strains and highest Flights, She sings of strange Adventures and Exploits, Battels, Enchantments, Furies, Devils, and Knights; When she at Arthur's Fairy Table dines, And high-pil'd Dishes sees, and generous Wines. 'Twas kindly done of the good-natur'd Cits, To place before thy Door a brace of Tits, For Pegasus would ne'er endure the Weight Of such a quibbling, scribbling, dribbling Knight. That generous Steed, rather than gaul his Back With a Pedantic Bard, and nauseous Quack, Wou'd kneel to take a Pedlar and his Pack. Epigram upon King Arthur. The British Arthur, as Historians tell, Deriv'd his Birth from Merlin's Magic Spell; When Uter, taking the wrong'd Husband's Shape, On fair Igerne did commit a Rape: But modern Arthur, of the Cheapside Line, May justly boast his Parentage Divine. Wearing thy Phyz, and in thy Habit drest, The God of Dulness his lewd Dam comprest. An Epitome of a Poem truly call'd, A Satire against Wit; done for the undeceiving of some Readers, who have mistaken the Panegyrick in that immortal Work for the Satire, and the Satire for the Panegyrick. Who can forbear, and tamely silent sit, l. 1. p. 3. And see his native Land as void of Wit l. 2. As every Piece the City Knight has writ? How happy were the old unpolish'd Times, l. 13. As free from Wit as other modern Crimes, l. 14. And what is more from Bl?re's nauseous Rhimes? As our Forefathers vig'rous were and brave, l. 15. So they were virtuous, wise, discreet and grave, l. 16. And would have call'd our Quack a fawning Slave. Clodpate, by Banks, and Stocks, and Projects bit, l. 5 p. 5. Turns up his Whites, and in his pious Fit, l 6. He Cheats and Prays, a certain sign of Cit. l 7. Craper runs madly 'midst the thickest Crowd, l 8. Sometimes says nothing, sometimes talks aloud. Under the Means he lies, frequents the Stage, l 10. Is very lewd, and does at Learning rage; l. 11. And this vile Stuff we find in every Page. A bant'ring Spirit has our Men possest, l. 20. And Wisdom is become a standing Jest, l. 21. Which is a burning Shame. I do protest. Wit does of Virtue sure Destruction make, l. 22. Who can produce a VVit, and not a Rake? l. 23. A Challenge started ne'er but by a Quack. The Mob of Wits is up to storm the Town, l. 1. p. 6. To pull all Virtue and right Reason down, l. 2. Then to surprize the Tower, and steal the Crown. And the lewd Crew affirm, by all that's good, l. 15. They'll not disperse till they have Bl??'s Blood, l 16. But they'll ne'er have his Brains, by good King Lud. For that industrious Bard of late has done l. 16. p. 6. The rarest Piece of Wit that e'er was shown, l. 17. And publish'd Doggrel he's asham'd to own. The skilful T?s?n's Name they dare invade, l. 31. p. 6. And yet they are undone without his Aid; l. 2. Did they read thee, I shou'd conclude 'em mad. T??s??n with base Reproaches they pursue, l. 1. p. 7. Just as his Moor-Fields Patients us'd to do, l. 4. Who give to T??s??n what is T??s??n's due. Wit does enfeeble and debauch the Mind, l. 7. Before to Business or to Arts inclin'd; l. 8. Then thou wilt never be debauch'd, I find. Had S??s, H??f, or T??y, who with Awe l. 15. to 18. We name, been Wits, they ne'er had learnt the Law. But sure the Compliment's not worth a Straw. The Law will ne'er support the bant'ring Breed l. 22. Tho' Blockheads may, yet Wits can ne'er succeed, l. 23. For which Friend Sl??ne, I hope, will break thy Head R???ff has Wit, and lavishes away l. 24. So much in nauseous Northern Brogue each Day, As would suffice to damn a Smithfield Play. Wit does our Schools and Colleges invade, l. 20 p. 8. And has of Letters vast Destruction made, l. 21 But that it spoils thy Learning, can't be said. That such a Failure no Man may incense, l. 7. p. 10. Let us erect a Bank for Wit and Sense, l. 18. And so set up at other Mens Expence. Let S?r, D?t, S?ld, M?gue l. 21. Lend but their Names, the Project then will do. l. 22. What? lend 'em such a Bankrupt Wretch as you! Duncombs and Claytons of Parnassus all, l. 27. Who cannot sink, unless the Hill should fall, l. 28. Why then they need but go to Sadlers-Hall, St. E??m??nt, to make the Thing compleat, l. 21. p. 9. No English knows, and therefore is most fit To oversee the coining of our Wit. l. 22: Nor shall M??rs, W???tt, Ch??rl??tt be forgot, With solid Fr??ke and R???r, and who not? Then all our Friends the Actions shall cry up, l. 6 p. 12. And all the railing Mouths of Envy stop. l. 7. Wou'd we could Padlock thine, eternal Fop. The Project then will T???tts Test abide, l. 11. p. 16. And with his Mark please all the World beside, l. 12. But dare thy Arthurs by this Test be try'd? Then what will D???n, G???h, or C?ng?ve say, l 17. p 9. When all their wicked Mixture's purg'd away? l. 28. Thy Metal's baser than their worst Allay. What will become of S??th??n, W??ch??y, l. 29. Who by this Means will grievous Sufferers be? l. 30. No matter, they'll ne'er send a Brief to thee. All these debauch'd by D??n and his Crew, l. 22. p. 12. Turn Bawds to Vice, and wicked Ends pursue, l. 23. To hear thee cant, would make even B?ss spue. For now an honest Man can't peep abroad, l. 9 p. 13. Nor a chaste Muse, but whip they bring a Rod. l. 16 E'n Atticus himself these Men would curse, l 5. p. 14. Should Atticus appear without his Purse, l. 6. If this be Praise, what Libel can be worse? Nay, Darfell too, should he forbear to treat, l 7. p. 14. These Men that cry him up, their Words would eat, And say in Scorn, he had no Brains to beat. Epigram, Upon the Fortunate and Auspicious Reigns of Queen Elizabeth, of happy Memory, and our most Gracious Queen Ann. Sure Heav'ns unerring Voice decreed of old The fairest Sex should Europe's Balance hold; As Great Eliza's Forces humbled Spain, So France now stoops to Ann's superior Reign. Thus tho' proud Jove with Thunder fills the Sky, Yet in Astrea's Hands the fatal Scale does lie. To Mr. Dryden, on his Conversion. Traytor to God, and Rebel to thy Pen, Priest-ridden Poet, perjur'd Son of Ben, If ever thou prove honest, then the Nation May modestly believe Transubstantiation. Upon the Pensioners in the Parliament. As when a Wolf or Fox too long does fleece The Non-resisting Lambs, or Passive Geese, The Peasants take th'Alarm, and seize the Foe, And shouting Boys in long Ovation go; The careful Housewife, to revenge her Wrongs, Takes down the sharpest Spit, and heats her Tongs; All their Resentments by their Curses show, And happy's he that gives the greatest Blow. Thro' every Street the stinking Vermin's led, To the Town-Hall, and there they fix his Head. First seize their Money, for 'tis all your due, These Slaves did get it all by selling you. A Comical Panegyrick on that familiar Animal, by the Vulgar call'd a Louse: By Mr. Willis, of St. Mary-Hall, Oxon; with some Additions by Mr. Tho. Brown. Tremendous Louse, who can withstand thy Power, Since Fear at first taught Mortals to adore? What mighty Disproportion do we see In Adam's Glory, when compar'd with thee? With greater Latitude thy Patent ran, Freely you rove o'er all the World of Man; And almost like Almighty Jove alone, Enjoy a Being you receive from none. Well might the sage Philosophers of old Their justling Atoms for authentick hold; For what thou art, alas, we know too well, But whence thy Being is, we cannot tell. Nor is thy Empire meaner than thy Birth, Thou'rt made of Mold refin'd, not common Earth. Whether thou rul'st by a Monarchick Sway, Or by three States, we passively obey. The boldest Hero, whom Ambition arms, Faces grim Death, but shrugs at thy Alarms. Thou to their Hearts hast often nearer been Than either their Religion or their Queen; And hast a much more constant Harbour there Than any thing but Villany and Fear. The sparkish General often dreads thy sight More than the numerous Foes he stands to fight. And tho' his happy Standards do prevail, E'er Night, to thee he surely turns his Tail. Thou the Grand Seignior dost surpass in Pride, Since thou on Christians Backs in State dost ride, And hast such Catholick and resistless Charms, That Prince and Prelate under thee bear Arms. The very Noncons and the Church we see, Tho' when they pray to God, they disagree, Yet fight with Uniformity for thee: And for thy sake, with Wretchedness each Day Lavish their Blood more freely than their Pay. Nature refines, what is by Nature crude, For thee she cooks and dresses Human Blood, To make it to thy Palate dainty Food. No wonder then that thou with those that fight So much art seen, since both in Blood delight. Or that thou should'st exert such sturdy Valour Against thy Enemy, the Prick-Louse Taylor, To take him every Moment by the Collar. How many Heroes hast thou forc'd to yield, And strip'd to own thee Master of the Field? But tho' so many Virtues in thee shine, That we can hardly think thee not Divine, It wou'd be great Injustice to pass o'er, How kind thou art, and mindful of the Poor; Whate'er befalls 'em of Calamity, They're certain of a Bosom Friend in thee: How often to oblige 'em you endeavour, Those Marks denote you list 'em in your Favour. Nor are they quite ungrateful in return, If any, yet clean Linens never worn; The Cripple too finds Leggs to strole the Streets, To beg for thee of every one he meets; Content with thee, and Straw instead of Sheets. As briskly too thou hast assisted those That Ethnick Superstition did oppose, But stuck most Orthodoxly to their Side That for the true Religion would have dy'd. That when the Huguenots of France came o'er, Millions of you came swarming to the Shore. So Jacob's Children, by the help of Lice, Obtain'd the Canaanitish Paradise. And you, we find, as formidable prove, As ratling Thunder in the Hand of Jove. Who can thy Power describe, thy Glories scan, Thou Lord of Nature, since thou'rt Lord of Man? In these we may thy wond'rous Value see, The World was made for Man, and Man for thee. Upon the Anonymous Author of Legion's humble Address to the Lords. Thou Tool of Faction, mercenary Scribe, Who preachest Treason to the Calves-head Tribe, Whose fruitful Head, in Garret mounted high, Sees Legions and strange Monsters in the Sky; Who wou'dst with War and Blood thy Country fill Were but thy Power as rampant as thy Will; Well may'st thou boast thyself a Million strong, But 'tis in Vermin that about thee throng. To that most senseless Scoundrel, the Author of Legion's humble Address to the Lords, who wou'd persuade the People of England to leave the Commons, and depend upon the Lords. What Dæmons mov'd thee, what malicious Fiends, To tempt the People from their surest Friends? Sooner thou might'st embracing Floods disjoyn, And make the Needle from its North decline; Or teach the grateful Heliotrope to run A different Motion from the enlivening Sun. Our Peers have often for themselves rebell'd, When did they for the People take the Field? Led not by Love, but Interest and Pride, They wou'd not let the Prince their Vassals ride. That Pow'r they to themselves reserv'd alone, And so thro' thick and thin they spur'd old Roan. To Fact and long Experience I appeal, How fairly to themselves they Justice deal; For if my Lord, o'erpower'd by Wine and Whore, The next he meets, does through the Entrails scow'r, 'Tis pity, his relenting Brethren cry, That for his first Offence the Youth shou'd die; Come, he'll grow grave, Virtue and he'll be Friends, And by his Voting make the Crown amends. 'Tis true, a most magnificent Parade Of Law, to please the gaping Mobb, is made. Scaffolds are rais'd in the Litigious Hall, The Maces glitter, and the Serjeants bawl. So long they wrangle, and so oft they stop, The wearied Ladies do their Moisture drop. This is the Court (they say) keeps all in awe, Gives Life to justice, vigour to the Law. True, they quote Law, and they do prattle on her, What's the Result; Not guilty upon Honour. Should I who have no Coronet to show, Fluster'd in Drink, serve the next Comer so, My Twelve blunt Godfathers wou'd soon agree, To doom me, sober, to the fatal Tree. Besides, how punctually their Debts they pay, There's scarce a Cit in London, but can say, By peep of Morn the trusting Wretch does rise, And to his Grace's Gate, like Lightning flies: There in the Hall this poor believing Ass, With gaping on bare Walls seven Hours does pass And so does Forty more in the same Class. At last my Lord, with Looks erect and hardy, “Troth, Friends, my Tenants have been somewhat tardy. “But for the future, this shall be redrest, “Delays and Losses may befall the best. This said, he presses with regardless Pride, Between the opening Squadrons on each side, Calls for his Page, then slips into his Chair, And so, good Gentlemen, you're as you were. Cease Scribler then, our Grandees to defame, With feign'd Encomiums that they scorn to claim; What they can challenge by the Laws o'th' Land, We freely give, while they no more demand; But let not in their Praise the Plot be brought, Thou know'st the Proverb, Nothing due for nought. A pleasant Dialogue beeween the Pillory and Daniel de Foe. Pill. Awake, thou busy Dreamer, and arise, Shake off th'unwilling Slumber from thy Eyes, De Foe. Hail dread Tribunal, reverend Machine, Of awful Phyz, and formidable Mein, Thou Prop of Justice, Adjutant of Law, That keep'st the Paper-blurring World in awe; But why this early Visit made to me? Must I again ascend thy Fatal Tree? Pill. No,—may'st thou never mount my Fabrick more, With much Concern, last Time, thy Weight I bore; And with regret, I see myself of late, Made a meer Tool and Property of State; Time was when Knaves, whom now for Gold they spare And such-like Villains trod my Bosom Care. The Scrivener and the Publick Notaries, Forgers of Bonds and Wills, were all my Votaries; Now I'm reverse (so humane Chances vary) And vent the Spleen of peevish Secretary. De Foe. Was it not for this you broke my easy Rest? You know what publick Failures I detest. How some Grandees are in a mortal Rage, To see we know the Scandal of our Age; And as they are the Grievance of the Times, Are most afraid of hearing their own Crimes. The last Observator: Or, The Devil in Mourning. A Dialogue between John Tutchin and his Countryman. Obs. Come honest Countryman, what News dost bring? Countr. Faith, Master John, they say you're like to swing. Obs. You know I once for Hanging did Petition. Countr. Ay, see th'Effects of preaching up Sedition, But the most general Report supposes, You'll on the Pillory tell Peoples Noses, When that Day comes— Your trusty Farmer here most humbly begs You'll let him give you a small Treat of Eggs. Obs. Jesting apart; hast with thee brought some Nancy, Or Protestant March Beer to raise my Fancy? Inspir'd by that, my Thoughts will quicker flow, And I'll by far out-hymn the fam'd De Foe. Countr. No, not a Drop, I'm to be gull'd no more; Too much you've trespass'd on the ancient Score. I'll be no longer with Whig Birdlime caught, Ne'er stir, I wou'd not save thee for a Groat. Misled by thee, I left my Herds and Flocks, And must turn Politician, with a Pox. Obs. And where's the harm to know the Springs of State? Countr. It only hasten'd Hone's and Rouse's Fate, Obs. Happen the worst, I've Friends will pay my cost. Countr. You reckon Nobs, I fear, without your Host. Obs. Won't merciful Low-Church espouse my Cause? Countr. They'll leave you to the Mercy of the Laws. Obs. But then the Whigs will back me tooth and nail. Countr. Yes, those are Saving Cards, that never fail. Obs. Old-Nick thus uses Witches, as they tell us, And drops the gaping Wretches at the Gallows. Will none my Person then from Malice Skreen? Say, Countryman, what think'st thou of my Queen? Countr. 'Slife not a word of her, thou Seandal-Pedlar Thy Loyalty's as rotten as a Medlar. After such Libelling the Royal Race, How dar'st thou sue to Majesty for Grace? Obs What, am I then by all the World forsaken? Countr. E'en get your Friends the Jews to save your Bacon; Or should you to the Devil's Church repair, None will suspect you'd venture Play-house Air. Obs. Howe'er I'm thus abandon'd by the rest, Yet while I'm still with thy dear Friendship blest— Countr. No Friendship nor Relief expect from me, Thro' all thy thin Pretences now I see; No more with sowre Republicans I'll herd, But pluck those prating Rascals by the Beard. No more with Mercenary Scribes take part, But get me Home, and mind my Plough and Cart; Scow'r o'er my Grounds by break of Day, old Tutchin, And freely pay my Taxes without grudging. No more notch'd Levi's holy Buckram hear, But with my Betters to the Church I'll steer. Dance with our Lads and Lasses on the Green, Then steal a harmless Buss—And so— GOD save the QUEEN. Advice to the Kentish Long-Tails, by the Wise Men of Gotham. In answer to their late sawcy Petition to the Parliament, 1701 We, the Long-Heads of Gotham, o'er our merry Cups meeting, To the Long-Tails of Kent, by these Presents send Greeting: WHEREAS we're inform'd, that your Maid-stone Grand Jury, A most Monstrous Petition has pen'd in a Fury, We are strangely surpriz'd at the News, we'll assure ye. Unless both our Reading and Memory fails, Old Kent has been fam'd, not for Heads, but for Tails. Not to make on your Intellects any Reflection, The Senate needs none of the Kentish Direction To prevent foreign Insults, and home Insurrection, Without your intruding and sage interposing, And thrusting where no Body calls you, your Nose in, Our Commons will steer the great Boat of themselves, And save it from dashing on Rocks or on Shelves; They'll provide for our Tarrs, and settle the Nation. Then let each private Man be content in his Station. We therefore advise you to lead sober Lives, To look after your Orchards, and comfort your Wives. To Gibbets and Gallows your Owlers advance, That, that's the sure way to mortify France; For Monsieur our Nation will always be gulling, While you take such care to supply him with Woollen. And if your Allegiance to Cæsar's so great, All smuggling and stealing of Customs defeat, Or else all your Loyalty's nought but a Cheat. Above all, let each Long-Tail his Talent employ, On his Spouse's soft Anvil to get such a Boy As will equal in Vigour the fam'd William Joy. Then in Peace you may eat both your boil'd and your Roast, And the French will be damn'd e'er they Land on your Coast. Signed by the Mayor, Aldermen, and the Common-Council, all the Inhabitants, both Men, Women and Children, that could make their Marks, at the Quarter-Sessions, holden at Gotham, in Comitatu Essex, the 12th of May, 1701. To a Lady, whom he refus'd to Marry, because he lov'd her. Marriage! the greatest Cheat that Priesthood e'er contriv'd, The sanctify'd Intriegue, by which poor Man's decoy'd, That damn'd Restraint to Pleasure and Delight, Th'unlawful Curber of the Appetite. Curst be the Sot that first the Chains put on, That added to the Fall, and made us twice undone. The Sex that liv'd before in a free common State, Or Golden Age, ne'er knew this Pious Cheat; Then Love was unadulterate and true, Then we did unconfin'd Amours pursue, If by his Flame the Shepherd was inspir'd, On no coy Trifles, the kind Nymph retir'd; The officious Trees pimp'd for the honest Trade, And form'd a very kind and welcome Shade. Then like the bord'ring Fields, was Womankind, By no Land-marks, or unjust Bounds confin'd. 'Tis true, if that, by my ill Stars inclin'd, So great a Trespass I shou'd e'er commit, Your Charms alone would change my Mind, And tempt me to the Sin, tho' mighty 'tis and great; For you'd with vigorous Beauty still incite The pall'd and wearied Appetite. And what's a mortal Sin with any other she, To do with you, a Venial Fault wou'd be. Jo. Haines's Reformation-Prologue, drest as a deep Mourner. Thus cloath'd with Shame, which is one step to Grace, Excuse the modest Blush now spoils my Face; For, after two Years Excommunication For heinous Sins against this Congregation, I'm now to plead my thorough Reformation Know then, that weary grown of the thin Fare. Of living by my Wits, that's by the Air; Altho' kind Patrons— “Into your Bumpers I have oft been plunging, “And top'd as if a Patent I 'ad for spunging; “But to proceed in't still, my Conscience stains, “Conscience, the darling Mistress of Jo. Haines. “Wherefore, tho' late, now finding like a Novice, “Players (like Wits) are Fools, when out of Office; And seeing Nocturnal Friends drop off so fast, Like Limerick, I'm compell'd to yield at last. But oh! the Terms of my Capitulation Would make the hardest Heart feel soft Compassion; I must not drink, nor taste Life's common Joys, For fear of spoiling my melodious Voice; No more at Midnight visit dear James Long, Who has the best Navarre e'er tip'd o'er Tongue; It has all good Qualities,— A conceal'd Body, fresh, mellow, and fine, 'Tis all Sincerity, a silken Wine; It charms the Taste, and gratifies the Nose, Weeping.Adieu my dear, dear Paradise, the Rose, Where I the Musick now must hear no morn, Of Spoke like a Drawer. a Bottle of Sebastian in the Sun, scare. Nor whilst God Bacchus is our Cheeks adorning, Like a Watchman. Past Three a Clock, and a dark cloudy Morning. Nor make the last Excuse for longer stay, As one drunk. More Wine, ye Dog, it's not yet break o' Day: Now, now, your new Regenerated Player, Morning and Evening, will trudge to Prayer; And fly all Play-house Plots that are a brewing, That National Sin (Sedition) was my Ruin. Jo. Haines's Reformation-Prologue. Adieu Will's Coffee-House too, Beaus, Captains, Wits, Who have been so very kind to me by fits. Farewell, I now must herd with sober Cits. Where I may speak my Mind, and fear no snub, With Friends will lend, as well as pay a Club. What tho' they ne'er broke Jest or Pate at Locket's? They've Sense enough, for all that, in their Pockets. I do but think, leading this Virtuous Life, What a Comfort I shall be to my poor Wife! At Home by ten a Clock, in Bed by eleven, Where I will make my former Scores all even. “This being decreed, I've nothing more to do, “But fix myself a Rent-charge now on you, Humbly beseeching ? “That I, like Parish Brat, Forlorn and Poor, “That's laid for want, at the next Rich Man's Door, “Swath'd in ill-luck, the Charity may get “Of you the great Church-Wardens of the Pit. Then tho' my Voice should fail, as that will hap in, I'm sure you'll guess my Meaning by my gaping. On his Friend Owen Swan, at the Black Swan-Tavern in Bartholomew-Lane. Mankind, unjustly Poets Atheists call, They're Atheists who adore no God at all. We Court the Vine, whose all-enlivening Heat, Does noble Flights and lively Thoughts create. Bacchus, to thee we daily Altars raise, When warm'd with Liquid Joy, we sound thy Praise. Nor can he be less than a God, whose Juice Does every Minute something great produce. Wit's the rich Product of the teeming Vine, Its great Creator is Almighty Wine. And powerful Love, arm'd with resistless Fires, Which melts the stubborn Soul to soft Desires. Then, Owen, since the God of Wine has made Thee Steward of the gay Carousing Trade, Whose Art decaying Nature still supplies, Warms the faint Pulse, and sparkles in our Eyes, Be bountiful, like him, bring t'other Flask, Were the Stairs wider, we wou'd have the Cask. This Pow'r we from the God of Wine derive. Draw such as this, and I pronounce thou'lt Live. MR. SWAN'S ANSWER. I, Owen Swan, the most sincere and honest Man That e'er drew Wine in Quart or Cann, From Beersheba unto Dan, Most humbly thanks you for your sage Epistle; Tho' my Muse can't Sing, she'll strive to Whistle. Your virtuous Gentlemen, the Rakes, Last Night were in for Ale and Cakes, (For Wine, I mean) but you'll forgive Mistakes. The Wits, dear Brother,— Are us'd to pardon one-another; And may old Nick your humble take, And as a Neighbour Brews, so may he never Bake, If he'd not drink an Ocean for your sake. My Verses limp; and, why? 'Tis meet They keep proportion to the Feet Of him who to his Cellar ran To fill your Bottles, OWEN SWAN. PLINY'S EPISTLES. [As the sequacious Wax with Ease receives] As the sequacious Wax with Ease receives Whatever Shape th'informing Artist gives: Now represents the furious God of War, Or in Minerva's Likeness does appear. Now a fair Venus shews, with all her Charms, Or wanton Cupid sporting in her Arms. As murm'ring Rivers, with their Chrystal Streams, Not only serve to quench th'aspiring Flames; But in belov'd Meanders, as they flow On Fields and Flowers, fresh Beauties do bestow: So should the Mind with early Care be wrought, And fashion'd for the diff'rent Turns of Thought. One Art alone too dull a Chase does yield: Your active Sportsman ranges all the Field.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND VOLUME OF THE WOKRS OF Mr. THO. BROWN. Containing LETTERS FROM THE Dead to the Living, And from the Living to the Dead. Both Serious and Comical. In Three Parts. Now Collected together in one Volume, with large Additions. TO THE Right Honourable THE Lord MANSEL. LETTERS From the Dead to the Living. PART I. Boileau's Answer to Juvenal. [Let Codrus, that nauseous pretender to Wit] Let Codrus, that nauseous pretender to Wit, Condemn all my Works before Courtier and Cit; I bear all with Patience, whatever he says, And value as little his Scandal as Praise. Vain-glory no longer my Genius does fire, 'Tis Interest alone tunes the Strings of my Lyre. Integrity's nought but a plausible Sham, For Money I Praise, and for Money I Damn. Old politic Bards, for Fame have no itching, The Apollo I court, is the Steam of a Kitchin. Mistress to King Hen. II. of France. Diana of Poictiers to Madam Maintenon. [I dare not, (were't to save my Ransom)] I dare not, (were't to save my Ransom) Affirm your Ladyship is Handsome; Nor without telling monstrous Lies, Defend the Lightning of your Eyes; For, Madam, to declare the Truth, You've neither Face, nor Shape, nor Youth. Howe'er, all Flattery apart, You've plaid your Cards with wondrous Art. When young, no Lover saw your Charms, Or prest you in his eager Arms: But Triumphs your old Age attend, And you begin where others end. Julia to the Princess of Conti [A mighty Monarch you begot] I A mighty Monarch you begot, Who's pious as the Devil; Your Mother too, by all is thought, To be extreamly civil. II Descended from so bright a Pair, You both their Gifts inherit; All your great Father's Virtue share, And all your Mother's merit. III When I was young and gay like you, I lov'd my Recreation; Mamma's dear Steps I did pursue, And bilk'd no Inclination. IV And, Madam, when your Charms are gone, Your Lovers will forsake you; They'l cry your sporting Days done, And bid old Pluto take you. V Thus I have given all Trading o'er, And wisely leave off sporting; Resolv'd to practise it no more, After my reign of courting. The Duchess of Fontagne to the Cumean Sybil. [Your tender Girls, when first their Hands] I Your tender Girls, when first their Hands, Are joyn'd in Hymen's magick Bands. Fondly believe they shall maintain A long, uninterrupted Reign: But to their Cost, too soon they prove, That Marriage is the bane of Love. The Phantom, Duty, damps its Fire. And clips the Wings of fierce Desire. II But Lovers in a diff'rent Strain Express, as well as ease their Pain: Ever smiling, ever fair, To please us is their only Care, And as their Flame finds no decay, They only covet we should pay In the same Coin, and that you know, Is always in our pow'r to do. Christiana Queen of SWEDEN to the Ladies. [Fate justly reach'd the pratling Fool] I Fate justly reach'd the pratling Fool, For telling Stories out of School. Was't not enough I stoop'd so low, On him m' Affection to bestow? To clasp him in my circling Arms, And feast him with Love's choicest Charms; But must the babling Fool proclaim, His Queen's Infirmity and Shame? II Of all the Sins on this side Hell, The blackest sure's to Kiss and tell. 'Tis Silence best becomes Delight. And hides the Revels of the Night, If then my Spark has met his Due, For bringing sacred Mysteries to View, E'en let him take it for his Pains, And curse his want of Gratitude and Brains. The ANSWER of a young Vestal to the Queen. [Madam, I much rejoice to hear] Madam, I much rejoice to hear, You'll take a Stone up in your Ear; For I'm a frail Transgressor too, And love the Sport as well as you. But then I chuse to do the Work, Within the Pale of holy Kirk: For Absolution cures the Scars, Contracted in venereal Wars, And saves our Sex a world of Prayers. Had you this ghostly Counsel taken, You might till now have sav'd your Baron. 'Tis safe intriguing with a Flamin, Who sanctifies their Work with Amen, Then who would trust ungodly Lay-Men? Do, Madam, as you please, but I, None but with Priesthood will employ, With them I'll live, with them I'll die. Who like the Pelian Spear are sure, With the same Ease they Wound to cure. Francis Rabelais, to the PHYSICIANS of PARIS [Oh! wou'd it not provoke a Maid] I Oh! wou'd it not provoke a Maid, By softest Vows and Oaths betray'd, Her Virgin Treasures to resign, And give up Honour's dearest Shrine? Then when her Charms have been enjoy'd; To be next moment laid aside. II But why do I lament in vain, And of my Destiny complain? Had I been wise as those before me, I should have made the World adore me; Not to one Lover's Arms confin'd, But search'd and try'd all Human kind. The Mitred Hog: A dialogue between Abbot Furtiere and Scarron [Thou nauseous everlasting Sow] Thou nauseous everlasting Sow, With Phiz of Bear, and Shape of Cow, With Eyes that in their Sockets twinkle, And Forehead plow'd with many a Wrinkle, With Nose that runs like Common-shore, And Breath that murders at Twelvescore: What! thou'rt resolv'd to give me VVar, And trounce me at the noisy Bar, Tho' it reduces thee to eat, Thy Smock for want of cleanlier Meat: Agreed, old Beldam! keep thy VVord, 'Twill soon reduce thee to eat a T?d. [Part II.] From Bully Dawson to Bully W? [The Gods on a day when their Worships were idle] The Gods on a day when their Worships were idle, Met all at the Sign of the Half-Moon and Fiddle; Old Bacchus and Venus did lovingly joyn, And swore there was nothing like Women and Wine: They drank till they all were as merry as Grigs, And wallowed about like a litter of Pigs; Till their Heads and their Tails were so little apart, That the breath of a Belch, mix'd with that of a Fart; But as it fell out, poor unfortunate Mars, Just nodded his Nose into Venus's Arse; Why how now, says Mars, ye old Jade d'y' suppose, Your Arse was design'd as a Case for my Nose? Then pulling his Head from her Bumb, fell a swearing, Her Honour smelt worse than a stinking Red-Herring. A SATYR against Fly-Blows. By Mr. W? Ye worst of Vermin that our Isle affords, Spawn of curs'd Flies, engender'd first in T?rds, Ye nitty Off-spring of a winged Plague, That swarms in Mutton from the Rump to th'Crag: Tormentors of our Cooks, all England's Foes, From rural Gluttons, to our London Beaus. In ev'ry cloven Joint thy Mother's blow, Where if not crush'd, you will to Maggots grow, Raise your black Heads, and crawl about our Food, And poison what was eatable and good; Pollute that Flesh which should our Lives maintain, To Dogs condemn what was design'd for Man. Ye Eggs of Mischief that in Clusters dwell, Hateful to the Eyes, and nauseous to the Smell, Ill Omens of a worse succeeding Harm, That makes good Housewives blush, the Husbands storm. For thee the faultless Cook-maid bears the blame, More Salt, you Slattern, crys the angry Dame, And then the Falchion-Ladle goes to work: I'll teach you, Jade, to salt the Beef and Pork. May Showers of Brine each Powdering-Tub o'erflow, Pepper and Salt in every Orchard grow; Then may each Hand to seas'ning be employ'd, That thy curs'd Race may be at once destroy'd. Your Humble Servant, W?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Third Volume OF THE WORKS OF Mr. Thomas Brown, Serious and Comical, In Prose and Verse. To the Right Honourable the Lord of COLERANE. AMUSEMENTS Serious and Comical, Calculated for the Meridian of London. Amusement I. [Stout should his Heart, and thoughtful be his Head] Stout should his Heart, and thoughtful be his Head, That would in slippery Paths with Judgment tread, And tempt the Dangers which on Courts attend, A smiling En'my, and a treach'rous Friend, As he of great Preferments waits the Call, Certain to slip, and almost sure to fall. Amusement III. [This Fabrick which at first was built] This Fabrick which at first was built, To be God's House of Pray'r, And not to pamper Priests in Guilt, Or hold a sleeping Mayor; Once perish'd by the vengeful Flame, Which all its Beauties raz'd, Nor could its awful Patron's Name Protect the Pile it grac'd. But as it fell before, by Fire, Which then destroy'd it whole, So now to Heav'n its Heights aspire, And rise again by Coal. [When Job contending with the Devil I saw] When Job contending with the Devil I saw, It did my Wonder, but not Pity draw: For I concluded, that without some Trick, A Saint at any time could match Old Nick. Next, came a fiercer Fiend upon his Back, I mean his Spouse, and stunn'd him with her Clack; But still I could not pity him, as knowing A Crab-tree Cudgel soon would send her going. But when the Quack engag'd with Job I spy'd, The Lord have Mercy on poor Job, I cry'd, What Spouse and Satan did attempt in vain, The Quack will compass with his Murd'ring Pen, And on a Dunghil leave poor Job agen. With Impious Doggrel he'll pollute his Theme, And make the Saint against his Will blaspheme. [Reader, beneath this Turf I lie] Reader, beneath this Turf I lie, And hold my self content, Piss, if you please, pray what care I, Since now my Life is spent: A Marble Stone indeed might keep My Body from the Weather, And gather People as I sleep, And call more Fools together: But hadst thou been from whence I came, Thou'dst never mince the matter, But shew thy Sentiments the same, And hate Stone-Doublets after. I'm dead, and that's enough t'acquaint A Man of any Sense, That if he's looking for a Saint, He must go farther hence. Between two Roses down I fell, As 'twixt two Stools a Platter; One held me up exceeding well T'other did no such matter: The Rose by Temple-Bar gave Wine, Exchang'd for Chalk; and fill'd me, But being for the Ready Coin, The Rose in Wood-street kill'd me. Amusement VI. GALLANTRY. Our God and Soldier we alike adore, Just at the brink of Danger, not before; After Deliverance, they're alike requited, Our God's forgotten, and our Soldier's slighted. A Declamation in Defence of Gaming against Drunkenness. [O charming Cask of sprightly Wine] O charming Cask of sprightly Wine, Whose Life bears equal Date with mine; Born both upon the Latian Shore, When Manlius Rome's great Taxes bore; Whether from thee Complaints arise, Or Wit around the Table flies, Or jarring Quarrels intervene, Or sickly Love, or biting Spleen, Or from thy friendly Vapours creep Upon my Temples easie Sleep, &amp;c. Æneas Sylvius's Satyr on The Women of the Town [Now do I know what 'tis that LOVE we name] Now do I know what 'tis that LOVE we name, Born among Rocks, from Rhodope he came, Or Thracian Ismarus, or Garamant Extream: Not from our Race has sprung the fatal Boy, Who only does our Happiness destroy, &amp;c. Letters to Gentlemen and Ladies. The Answer. In all Love's Dominions I challenge the Boy To shew such a forward frank Lover as I: So faithful and true where my Promise is past, At the first so sincere, and so warm at the last. Imprimis, I've sworn true Allegiance to Phillis; And the same I have done to divine Amarillis: Then to Cælia the Fair I my Heart did resign; Next I laid down the Trifle at Iris's Shrine. Calista then gently put in for the Prize, Nor did the coy Sylvia my Off'ring despise. But now you'll enquire, can they all quarter there? Why, Madam, my Heart's large enough, never fear. There's room for my Phillis, And soft Amarillis: And Cælia the Fair, Who need not despair Of a good Lodging there: With Iris, Calista, and Sylvia beside. Yes, Madam, this oft by Experience I've try'd. So large is the Place, and so plenteous my Store, I with Ease can provide for six Mistresses more; Nay, if you distrust me, e'en send me a Score. A Walk round London and Westminster. Upon OLD MAN's and YOUNG MAN's COFFEE-HOUSES. [Nature, in Pity to our Pain] Nature, in Pity to our Pain, And with design to ease us, Has to her boundless Beauty joyn'd A boundless Will to please us. [Their Care and Pains the Fair-ones do bestow] Their Care and Pains the Fair-ones do bestow, Not to please God above, but Man below; Who thinks them Saints, are damnably mistook, They're only Saints and Angels in their Look. [The Ladies here, their Lovers Hearts] The Ladies here, their Lovers Hearts, By their Devotion win; Tho' all is Rock and Stone without, Yet all is soft within. [Fond Isra'l after Brazen Idols whor'd] Fond Isra'l after Brazen Idols whor'd, Egyptian Meroe a Cat ador'd, Fishes and Dogs her impious Zeal implor'd. No Superstition, surely, cou'd allow Respect to thee, and none but we cou'd bow To such a brazen peevish Cur as thou. St. James's Park. [The Colonels here in solemn manner meet] The Colonels here in solemn manner meet, Not with a full Design the French to beat, But to consult where they may nicely eat; What Trusting Mortal sells the noblest Wine, Where, free from Duns, they may securely dine. [Tyrant and Traytor then were Names unknown] Tyrant and Traytor then were Names unknown, Nor Guards secur'd, nor Fears disturb'd a Throne: Then Kings enjoy'd a long and happy Reign, And slept as quiet as the meanest Swain; Honour'd and Old, to Death did gently bend, And without Blood to Proserpine descend. Westminster Abbey. [All mortal things are subject to decay] All mortal things are subject to decay, And when Fate summons, Monarchs must obey. Upon the Compters. [Swift of Access is Ceres grizly Son] Swift of Access is Ceres grizly Son, His Brazen Gates on ready Hinges turn: But from Avernus, and the Realms of Night, Upwards to move, and view the Æthereal Light; This is the Task ? The London and Lacedemonian Oracles. Queries in Metre. [Self-nam'd Athenians, let it, pray, be shown] Quest. Self-nam'd Athenians, let it, pray, be shown, (For sure 'tis obvious to your mighty Wits) Why Farts burn blue when through a Candle blown, And yet that's yellow which the same A?e sh?ts? [Hail, Bard Divine! unknown, we must adore] Vol. 5. N. 11. Hail, Bard Divine! unknown, we must adore, Thy Eagle Pitch out-soars our haggard Flight: Our glimm'ring Lamp within will flame no more, Quench'd by too unsupportable a Light, &amp;c. [Tell me, ye Men of doughty Quill] Quest. Tell me, ye Men of doughty Quill, And shew in Heraldry your Skill, Which Order's best, and valu'd most, Knights of the Stocks, or of the Post? Mistake me not, for I'm sincere, I mean no Sham-Athenians here, Altho' their Mansion of chief Fame Stands by a Market of that Name: Yet must I needs confess, their Writing Deserves no other sort of Knighting; Nor to a Sir can make Pretence, Unless 'twere join'd with Reverence. Quest. Tell me, in fine, what Scorn is due to those, Who bid us all our Doubts to them propose, Yet answer none, where difficult and hard; But call them Riddles, and not worth Regard? When OEdipus, if we may credit Fame, Clearing a Riddle, got a Hero's Name. Excuse th'unequal Instance that I bring; For what Comparison is in the Thing? Athenian Rubbish, and a Theban King.</field>

Part of the 2d Ode in Horace l. 4. Translated. Beginning at, Dignum laude Virum. I From dark Oblivion, and the silent Grave, Th'indulgent Muse does the brave Hero save; 'Tis she forbids his Name to die, And brings it to the Stars, and sticks it in the Sky. II Thus mighty Hercules did move To the Eternal Palaces above: Nor all his twelve Exploits advanc'd him to the Sphere, But 'twas the Poet's Pain and Labour brought him there. III Thus the fam'd Spartan Twins did rise, From Ornaments of Earth to gild the Skies: Tho' Heav'n by Turns they do obtain, Yet in immortal Verse, the Brothers joyntly reign. IV And Bacchus too, for all his vain Pretence, Borrow'd his Crown and Godhead hence: He with his powerful Juice first taught the Muse to fly, And she in kind requital gave him immortality. A Translation of Ode iii. l. 1. in Horace. Sic te Diva potens Cypri, Sic Fratres Helenæ lucida Sydera, &amp;c. Address'd to his Honour'd Friend Mr. B? going into Turkey. I So may the Beauteous Goddess of the Main Appease the Horrors of the Deep, And Æolus lock all his blustring Train, But the auspicious Western Gales, asleep. II And thou, kind Vessel, which before this Day, So great a Charge cou'd'st never boast, With Care my dearer, better Part convey, And land him safely on the Thracian Coast. III His fearless Heart immur'd with tripple Brass. The daring Mortal surely wore, Who first the faithless Main durst pass, And in a treacherous Bark new Worlds explore. IV What Scenes of Death cou'd shake his Soul That unconcern'd saw the wild Billows rise, And scaly Monsters on the Surface rowl, And Whizzing Meteors paint the gloomy Skies. V In vain wise Heav'ns indulgent Care Lands from the spacious Ocean did divide; If with expanded Sails bold Ships prepare To plow the Deep, and brave the swelling Tide; VI But Man, that busie reasoning Tool, Cheap Happiness disdains to choose: Sick of his Ease, the restless Fool, At his own Cost forbidden Paths pursues, VII From the refulgent Orb of Day A glitt'ring Spark the rash Prometheus stole, And fondly stampt into a Soul, T'inform his new-made Progeny of Clay. VIII Strait to reward his Sacrilegious Theft, Fevers and Ills, unknown before, Their old infernal Mansions left, And thro' the sickning Air their baleful Poysons bore. IX Then Death, that lately travell'd slow, Content with single Victims, where he came, Made Haste, and eager of his Game, Whole Nations lopp'd at one compendious Blow. X To what fantastic Heights does Man aspire, Doom'd to dull Earth; the Sot wou'd clamber higher; Heav'n he invades with impudent Pretence, And makes Jove thunder in his own Defence. An Imitation of the 6th Ode in Horace, l 1. Scriberis vario fortis, &amp; hostium . . . . In the Year 1685. after the defeat of the Rebels in the West. I. Waller, in never-dying Verse, Your glorious Triumphs may rehearse; His lofty Muse for Panegyric fam'd, May sing the Rebel-herd your Valour tam'd. And all the mighty Blessings show, Great James, and We to your wise Conduct owe. II. My unambitious Lyre tunes all her Strings To lower Numbers, lower Things; And Gods, and God-like Heroes do refuse The Labour of a more exalted Muse. Had she endeavour'd to relate Great Alexander's Deeds, or Troy's unhappy Fate, Or all the Wonders that by Drake were done, Who travell'd with the Stars, and journey'd with the Sun; As long a Space had the vain Labour held, As that fam'd Town the Grecian Force repell'd. As long had she the tiresom Work renew'd, As mighty Drake thro' unknown Seas his wondrous Course pursu'd. III. The humble Muse too well her Weakness knows, Nor on her feeble self, dares the high Task impose. Tho' had not Heav'n the Power deny'd, No other Theme had all her Thoughts employ'd. 'Tis hence she modestly declines to sing, The immortal Triumphs of our war-like King; Lest her unequal slender Vein Shou'd lessen the great Actions of his glorious Reign. IV. Who can with all his boasted Fancy raise To its just Height, Heroic Arthur's Praise, Or worthily recount the Trophies won By our great Edward, and his greater Son? But oh! what Muse of all the Tribe below Can mighty Mars in equal Numbers show, Horrid in Steel, and moving from afar, With all the solemn Pageantry of War, Tho' the rough God shou'd his own Bard inspire, And join the Martial Heat to the Poetic Fire. V. Harmless Combats, harmless Wars, Slender Scratches, petty Jars, Which youthful Blood, and wanton Love, Amongst our amorous Couples move, Employ my time, employ my Muse, All other Subjects I refuse. A Translation of Teucer Salamina, Patremq; Cum fugeret, &amp;c. Hor. Ode vii. lib. 1. I Brave Teucer, (as the Poets tell us) When from his native Clime he fled, With Poplar Wreaths crown'd his triumphant Head, And thus he cheer'd his drooping Fellows. II Where e'er the Fates shall shew us Land, (Remote and distant tho' it be) We'll shape our Course at their Command, And boldly fix, as they decree. III Let no wild Fears your Hopes betray, Let not Dispair your Courage pall; When Heav'n so loudly does to Honour call, And fearless Teucer leads the way. IV Phœbus foretold (and he of all the Powers Commands the mystic Books of Fate) That fresh Success shou'd on our Actions wait, And new Salamis be ours. V Then drink away this puling Sorrow, Let Wine each dastard Thought subdue, Let Wine your fainting Hopes renew, We'll leave the drowsie Land, and plough the Main morrow. Hor. Ode 8. l. 1. Per omnes Te Deos oro, Sybarin cur properes amando Perdere? &amp;c. I Tell me, O Lydia, for by Heavens I swear, You shan't deny so just a Prayer. Tell me, why thus young Damon you destroy, And nip the blooming Virtues of the lovely Boy. II Why does he never throw the manly Bar; And practice the first Feats of War; Or gaily shining in his Martial Pride, With a strong artful Hand the foaming Courser guide. III Why does he never grasp the pond'rous Shield, And meet his Equals in the Field: Or when the Streams swell with the flowing Tide, With his soft pliant Arms the Silver Thames divide. IV Why does he lurk, for I bewail his Doom, Like an Alsatian Bully still at Home, That fears to walk abroad all day, Lest eager hungry Cits shou'd hurry him away. Ode ix. Lib. 1. in Horace imitated. Vides ut alta stet nive candidum, &amp;c. Written in the year, 1685. To Sir John Bowyer. I Since the Hills all around us do Pennance in Snow, And Winters cold Blasts have benumm'd us below; Since the Rivers chain'd up, flow with the same Speed, As Prisoners advance towards the Psalm they can't read, Throw whole Oaks at a Time, nay, Groves, on the Fire, They shall be our Sobriety's Funeral-Pyre. II Never wast the dull Time in impertinent thinking, But urge and pursue the great business of drinking; Come pierce your old Hogsheads, ne'er stint us in Sherry, This, this is the Season to drink and be merry: Then reviv'd by our Liquour and Billets together, We'll out-roar the loud Storms, and defy the cold Weather. III Damn your Gadbury, Partridge and Salmon together, What a puling Discourse have we here of the Weather; Nay, no more of that Business, but, Friend as you love us, Leave it all to the Care of the good Folks above us. Your Orchards and Groves will be shatter'd no more, If to hush the rough Winds, they forbid them to roar. IV Send a Bumper about, and cease this Debate Of the Tricks of the Court, and Designs of the State. Whether Brandon, or Offly, or Booth go to pot, Ne'er trouble your Brains; let 'em take their own Lot. Thank the Gods, you can safely sit under your Vine, And enjoy your old Friends, and drink off your own Wine. V While your Appetite's strong, and good Humour remains, And active fresh Blood does enliven your Veins; Improve the fleet Minutes in Scenes of Delight, Let your Friend have the Day, and your Mistress the Night. In the Dark you may try, whether Phyllis is kind, The Night for Intrieguing was ever design'd. VI Tho' she runs from your Arms, and retires in the Shade, Some friendly kind Sign will betray the coy Maid; All trembling you'll find the modest poor Sinner, 'Tis a venial Trespass in a Beginner: But remember this Counsel, when once you do meet her, Get a Ring from the Nymph, or something that's better: A Paraphrase on Horace of Vides ut Altæ. I The Hills (you see) are cover'd o'er With a grave Coat of rev'rend Snow, And Thames that did so lately roar, Fetter'd in Icy Chains can hardly flow; A sullen Frost the Ground o'er spreads, The over-burthen'd Trees hang down their mournful Heads. II Come then oblige us with a Fire, That may substantial Warmth inspire; Tho' now no drinking in the Plants goes round, But dull Sobriety's in Nature found; Think not this shall excuse your Beer With Men 'tis th'true drinking Season of the Year. III For God's-sake let the Powers above Their Business mind, and govern all below, If they think fit these Tempests to remove, No more shall rugged Boreas blow, No more the frozen Plants decay, But smile as they enjoy'd a long continu'd May. IV To learn your Lot and future State, Ne'er pry into the Adamantine Books of Fate, But gratefully those Powers adore, That added this kind Hour to the old Score; And be content with what is given, 'Tis all the free and voluntary Gift of Heaven. V Ne'er think in your declining Years, To pay neglected Love's Arrears; But while fresh Vigour does inflame, Pursue with haste, the lovely Game, Your Talent carefully improve, Indulge the Day in Wine; and spend the Night in Love. VI If now some Laughter, or betraying Noise, she flies, Will shew you where she panting lies; Then all your store of Rhetorick imply, The blushing Damsel to enjoy. If she hold out, then steal at least a Kiss, And take a Pawn for a substantial Bliss. The x. Ode in Horace l. 3. Paraphrased. Extremum Tanaim si biberes Lyce. I. Tho' you, my Lyce, in some Northen Flood Had chill'd the Current of your Blood; Or lost your sweet engaging Charms In some Tartarian Husband's icy arms; Were yet one Spark of Pity left behind To form the least Impression on your Mind, Sure you must grieve, sure you must sigh, Sure drop some Pity from your Eye, To see your Lover prostrate on the Ground, With gloomy Night, and black Despair encompass'd all around. II. Hark! how the threatning Tempests rise, And with loud Clamours fill the Skies; Hark! how the tott'ring Buildings shake, Hark! how the Trees a doleful Consort make. And see! oh see! how all below. The Earth lyes cover'd deep in Snow, The Romans clad in white, did thus the Fasces woo; And thus your freezing Candidate, my Lyce, sues for you. III. Come, lay these foolish Niceties aside, And to soft Passion sacrifice your Pride: Let not the precious Hours with fruitless Questions dye, But let new Scenes of Pleasure crown them, as they fly. Slight not the Flames which your own Charms infuse, And no kind friendly Minute lose, While Youth and Beauty give you leave to chuse. As Men by Acts of Charity below Or purchase the next World, or think they do: So you in Youth a Lover shou'd engage, To make a sure Retreat for your declining Age. IV. Let meaner Souls by Virtue be cajol'd, As the good Grecian Spinstress was of old; She, while her Sot his youthful Prime bestow'd To fight a Cuckold's Wars abroad, Held out a longer Siege, than Troy, Against the warm Attacks of proffer'd Joy, And foolishly preserv'd a worthless Chastity, At the expence of ten Years Lyes and Perjury. Like that old fashion'd Dame ne'er bilk your own Delight, But what you've lost ith' Day, get, get it in the Night. V. Oh! then if Prayers can no Acceptance find, Nor Vows, nor Offerings bend your Mind; If all these pow'rful Motives fail, Yet your Husband's Injuries prevail He, by some Play-house Jilt misled, Elsewhere bestows the Tribute of your Bed; Let me his forfeited Embraces share, Let me your mighty Wrongs repair. Thus Kings by their own Rebel-Powers betray'd, To quell the home-bred Foe call in a foreign Aid. VI. Love, let Platonicks promise what they will, Must, like Devotion, be encourag'd still; Must meet with equal Wishes and Desires, Or else the dying Lamp in its own Urn expires. And I, for all that boasted Flame We Poets and fond Lovers idly claim, Am of too frail a Make, I fear, Shou'd you continue still severe, To brave the double Hardships of your Fate, And bear the Coldness of the Nights, and Rigor of your Hate. Hor. Ode 11. l. 2. Quid Bellicosus Cantaber, &amp; Scythes, Hirpine Quincti, cogitet, Adria, Divisus objecto, remittas Quærere, &amp;c. I What the Bully of France, and our Friends on the Rhine, With their stout Grenadiers this Summer design, Cease over your Coffee, and Wine to debate: Why the Devil shou'd you, that live this side the Water, Pore over Gazettes, and be vext at the Matter? Come, come, let alone these Arcana's of State. II Alas! while such idle Discourse you maintain, And with politick Nonsense thus trouble your Brain, Your Youth flies away on the Back of swift Hours, Which no praying, no painting, no sighing restores. Then you'll find, when old Age has discolour'd your Head, Tho' a Mistress be wanting, no rest in your Bed. III Prithee do but observe, how the Queen of the Night Still varies her Station, and changes her Light: Now with a full Orb she the Darkness does chace, Now like Whores in the Pit, shews but half of her Face. These Chaplets of Flowers that our Temples adorn, Now tarnish and fade, that were fresh in the Morn. IV But to leave off Similes for Curates in Camblet To lard a dry Sermon, for grave Folks in Hamlet, While our Vigour remains, we'll our Talents improve, Dash the Pleasures of Wine with the Blessings of Love. Here, carelesly here, we'll lie down in the Shade Which the friendly kind Poplars and Lime-Trees have made. V Your Claret's too hot . . . Sirrah, Drawer go bring A Cup of cold Adam from the next purling Spring. And now your Hand's in, prithee step o'er the Way, And fetch Madam Tricksy, the brisk and the gay. Bid her come in her Alamode Manto of Sattin, Two Coolers, I'm sure, with our Wine can be no false Latin. The 13th Ode in Horace l. 4. Paraphrased. Audivere Lyce Dii mea Vota: Dii Audivere Lyce; fis Anus &amp; tamen Vis formosa videri, &amp;c. I Long have my Prayers slow Heaven assail'd; But Thanks to all the Powers above, That still revenge the Cause of injur'd Love, Lyce at last they have prevail'd. My Vows are all with Usury repaid, For who can Providence upbraid, That sees thy former Crimes with hasten'd Age repaid. II Thou'rt old, and yet by awkard Ways dost strive Th'unwilling Passion to revive; Dost drink, and dance, and touch thy Lyre, And all to set some puny Heart on Fire. Alas! in Chloe's Cheeks love basking lies; Chloe great Beauty's fairest prize, Chloe, that charms our Ears, and ravishes our Eyes. III The vigorous Boy flies o'er the barren Plains, Where sapless Oaks their wither'd Trunks extend; For Love, like other Gods, disdains To grace the Shrine that Age has once profan'd. He too laughs at thee now, Scorns thy grey Hairs, and wrinkled Brow, How should his youthful Fires agree with hoary Ages snow? IV In vain, with wondrous Art, and mighty Care, You strive your ruin'd Beauty to repair; No far-fetcht Silks one Minute can restore, That Time has added to the endless Score. And precious Stones, tho' ne'er so bright, That shine with their own native Light, Will but disgrace thee now, and but inhance thy Night. V Ah me! where's now that Mien! that Face! That Shape! that Air! that every Grace! That Colour! whose inchanting Red Me to Love's Tents a Captive led. Strange turn of Fate! that she Who from my self so oft has stol'n poor me, Now by the just revenge of time, stol'n from herself should be. VI Time was when Lyce's powerful Face To Phyllis only gave the place; Perfect in all the little Tricks of Love. That charm the Sense, and the quick Fancy move. But Fate to Phyllis a long Reign deny'd, She fell in all her blooming Beauty's Pride, She conquer'd whilst she liv'd, and triumph'd as she dy'd. VII Thou, like some old Commander in Disgrace, Surviving the past Conquests of thy Face, Now the greater Business of thy Life is done, Review'st with Grief the Trophies thou hast won. Damn'd to be parch'd with Lust, tho' chill'd with Age, And tho' past Action, damn'd to tread the Stage, That all might laugh to see that glaring Light, Which lately shone so fierce and bright, End with a Stink at last, and vanish into Night. The xv Ode in Horace Lib. 3. Imitated Uxor pauperis Ibici, Tandem Nequitiæ fige Modum tuæ, Famosisq; Laboribus, &amp;c. I At length, thou antiquated Whore, Leave trading off, and sin no more; For Shame in your old Age turn Nun, As Whores of everlasting Memory have done. II Why shouldst thou still frequent the Sport, The Balls, and Revels of the Court? Or why at glittering Masks appear, Only to fill the Triumphs of the Fair? III To Ghent or Brussels strait adjourn, The Lewdness of your former Life to mourn, There brawny Priests in Plenty you may hire, If Whip, and wholesom Sackcloth cannot quench the fire. IV Your Daughter's for the Business made, To her in Conscience quit your Trade. Thus, when his conquering Days were done, Victorious Charles resign'd his Kingdom to his Son. V Alas! ne'er thrum your long disus'd Guittar, Nor with Pulvilio's scent your Hair, But in some lonely Cell abide, With Rosary and Psalter dangling at your Side. A Translation of Ode xxiii. lib. 1. Vitas Hinnuleo me similis, Chloe, Quærenti pavidam Montibus aviis Matrem, &amp;c. I Why flies Belinda from my Arms? Or shuns my kind Embrace? Why does she hide her blooming Charms? And where I come forsake the Place. II Like some poor Fawn, whom every Breath Of Air does so surprize; In the least Wind he fancies Death, And pants at each approaching Noise. III Alas! I never meant thee ill, Nor seek I to devour thee, Why should'st thou then with Coldness kill The dying Slave that does adore thee. IV Leave, leave thy Mothers Arms for shame, Nor fondly hang about her, Thou'rt now of age to play the Game, And ease a Lover's Pain without her. The xxvi. Ode in Hor. l. 3. Paraphras'd. Vixi puellis nuper idoneus, Et militavi non sine Gloria: &amp;c. I Tis true, while active Blood my Veins did fire, And vigorous Youth gay Thoughts inspire, (By your leave, Courteous Reader, be it said) I cou'd have don't as well as most Men did; But now I am (the more's the Pity) The veriest Fumbler in the City. II There, honest Harp, that hast of late So often bore thy sinful Master's Fate, Thou a crack'd Side, and he a broken Pate; Hang up, and peaceful Rest enjoy; Hang up, while poor dejected I, Unmusical, unstrung like thee, sit mourning by. III And likewise all ye trusty Bars, With whose Assistance heretofore, When Love engag'd me in his Wars, I've batter'd, heaven forgive me, many a Door; Lie there, till some more able Hand Shall you to your old pious Use command. IV But, oh kind Phœbus, lend a pitying Ear To thy old Servant's humble Prayer, Let scornful Chloe thy Resentments feel, Lash her all o'er with Rods of Steel; And when the Jilt shall of her Smart complain; This 'tis, then tell her, to disdain Thy sacred Power, and scorn a Lover's pain. Hor. Ode 27. l. 1. Natus in Usum lætitiæ Scyphis Pugnare, Thracum est. I. To fight in your Cups, and abuse the good Creature, Believe it, my Friends, is a Sin of that Nature, That were you all damn'd for a tedious long Year To nasty Mundungus, and heath'nish small Beer, Such as after Debauches your Sparks of the Town, For a pennance next Morning devoutly pour down, It would not attone for so vile a Transgression, You're a Scandal to all of the drinking Profession. II. What a pox do ye bellow, and make such a Pother, And throw Candlesticks, Bottles, and Pipes at each other? Come keep the King's Peace, leave your damning and sinking, And gravely return to good Christian drinking. He that flinches his Glass, and to drink is not able, Let him quarrel no more, but knock under the Table. III. Well, Faith, since you've rais'd my ill Nature so high, I'll drink on no other Condition, not I, Unless my old Friend in the Corner declares What Mistress he Courts, and whose Colours he wears: You may safely acquaint me, for I'm none of those That use to divulge what's spoke under the Rose. Come, part with't . . . What she! forbid it ye Powers, What unfortunate Planet rul'd o'er thy Amours? Why Man she has lain (Oh thy Fate how I pity!) With half the blue Breeches and Whigs in the City. Go thank Mr. Parson, give him thanks with a Curse, Oh those damnable Words, For better for worse. To regain your old Freedom you vainly endeavour, Your Doxy and You no Priest can dissever, You must dance in the Circle, you must dance in't for ever. The same Ode imitated. Natis in usum lætitiæ Scyphis, &amp;c. What Boys, are ye mad? is the Dutch Devil in ye? Must your Quarrels as long as your Glasses continue? Give it o'er, ye dull Sots! let the dull-pated Boors, Snic or snee, at their Punch-Bowls, or slash for their Whores, We'll be merry and wise, but for Bloodshed we bar it, No Red shall be seen here but your Port and good Claret, What a P? should we fight for? No Bayonets here But the Sconces all round and the Bottles appear. Look, the Wine blushes for us! while it gently disgraces Our unnatural Freaks and our mortifi'd Faces. Come let's do what we came for! let the Brimmers be crown'd, And a Health to all quiet Good-fellows go round! Must I take off my Glass too? then Jack prithee tell us Thy new-Mistresses Name: What a Mischeif! art Jealous? Must her Name be a Secret? Alons, then I've done, Hang the greedy Curmudgeon that eats all alone, Come discover, you Block-head! I'm sure I mistook ye, Else in these Amours Jack was us'd to be lucky Well, but whisper it then! I'll keep Counsel, ne'er fear it, Is it she? the damn'd Jilt! Gad let no Body hear it; Why, Faith Jack thou'rt undone then, 'twas some Witchcraft I'm sure Could betray thee to th'Arms of a Pockified Whore, Well, 'tis vain to repine Boy; let us drink away Sorrow, Use thy freedom to Night Man, let the Punk reign to Morrow, An Imitation of the 14th Epod in Hor. Mollis Inertia cur tantam diffuderit imis Oblivionem sensibus, Pocula Lethæos ut si ducentia Somnos Arente Fauce traxerim, Candide Mæcenas, occidis sæpe rogando, &amp;c. I Ask me no longer, dear Sir John, Why your Lampoon lies still undone, 'Fore George my Brain's grown addle; Nor bid me Pegasus bestride, Why should you ask a Sot to ride That cannot keep his Saddle? II This was the poor Anacreon's Case, When doting on a smooth-chinn'd Face, He pin'd away his Carcass. To tune his Strings the Bard essay'd, The Devil a String the Bard obey'd, And was not this a hard Case? III If you a constant Miss have got, Thank heaven devoutly for your Lot, Such Blessings are not common. While I, condemn'd to endless Pain, Must tamely drag Belinda's Chain, Yet know she's worse than—Woman. A Translation from Horace of Mollis inertia, February 85. I How such a fit of Lethargy, My Senses has possest, As if a Dose of Opium Had buried me in rest! II With often asking what's the Cause You weary me your Friend, The Satyrs which I promis'd you, I cannot bring to end. III So poor Anacreon, as they say, Bewitch'd by powerful Love, Complain'd him often of his Wound, In Melancholy Grove. IV The Mistress that you court, my Friend, Tis fit you should adore, I like a Fool am Phygia's Slave, Yet know she is a Whore. MARTIAL'S EPIGRAMS. Translated by Mr. Tho. Brown. The PREFACE. Without formal Petition Thus stands my Condition, I am closely block'd up in a Garret, Where I scribble and smoak, And sadly invoke The powerful assistance of CLARET. Four Children and a Wife, 'Tis hard on my Life, Beside my self and a Muse, To be all cloath'd and fed, Now the Times are so dead, By my scribbling of Dogg'rel and News. And what I shall do, I'm a Wretch if I know, So hard is the Fate of a Poet; I must either turn Rogue, Or, what's as bad Pedagogue, And so drudge like a Thing that has no Wit. My Levee's all Duns, Attended by Bums, And my Landlady too she's a Teazer, At least four times a day She warns me away, And what can a Man do to please her? Here's the Victualler and Vintner, The Cook and the Printer With their Myrmidons hovering about, Sir. The Taylor and Draper, With the Cur that sells Paper, That in short I dare not stir out, Sir. But my Books sure may go, My Master Ovid's did so, And tell how doleful the Case is; If it don't move your Pity To make short of my Ditty, 'Twill serve you to wipe your Arses. Mart. Epig. 5. l. 2. Ne valeam si non totis, Deciane, diebus, Et tecum totis Noctibus esse velim. In some vile Hamlet let me live forgot, Small Beer my Portion, and no Wine my lot: To some worse Fiend in Church-Indentures bound, Than ancient Job, or modern Sherlock found. And with more Aches plagu'd, and Pains, and Ills; Than fill our Salmon's Works, or Tilburgh's Bills; If 'tis not still the burden of my Prayer The Night with you, with you the Day to share. But Sir, (and the Complaint you know is true) Two damn'd long Miles there lie 'twixt me and you; And these two Miles, by help of Calculation, Make four, by that I've reach'd my Habitation. You're near Sage Will's, the Land of Mirth and Claret; I live stow'd up in a White-Chappel Garret: Oft when I've walk'd so far, your Hands to kiss, Flatter'd with Thoughts of the succeeding Bliss, I'm told you're gone to the vexatious Hall, Where with eternal Lungs the Lawyers bawl? Or else stole out, some Female Friend to see; Or, what's as bad, you're not at Home for me. Two Miles I've at your service, and that's civil, But to trudge four, and miss you, is the Devil. Advice to a Vintner. Mart. Epig. 19. l. 1. The Hint taken from Quid te Tucca juvat. What Planet distracts thee, what damnable Star, To dash honest Bourdeaux with vile Bar a Bar? Why should innocent Claret be murder'd by Port, Thou'lt surely be sentenc'd in Bacchus's Court. As for us Drunken Rakes, if we hang, or we drown; Or are decently poyson'd, what loss has the Town; But to kill harmless Claret, that does so much Good, Is downright Effusion of true Christian Blood: Ne'er think what I tell you is matter of Laughter, Thou'lt be curst fort in this World, and damn'd for't hereafter. Mart. Epig. 23. l. 1. Si memini, fuerant tibi quatuor, Ælia, dentes. I When Gammar Gurton first I knew, Four Teeth in all she reckon'd: Comes a damn'd Cough, and whips out two, And 'tother two, a second. II Courage, old Dame, and never fear The third, when e'er it comes; Give me but t'other Jugg of Beer, And I'll ensure your Gums. An Imitation of an Epigram 44. in Mart. lib. 3. Occurit tibi nemo quod libenter, &amp;c. That Cousins, Friends, and Strangers fly thee, Nay, thy own Sister can't sit nigh thee; That all Men thy Acquaintance shun, And into Holes and Corners run, Like Irish Beau from English Dun, The Reason's plain, and if thou'd'st know it, Thou'rt a most damn'd repeating Poet. Not Bayliff sow'r, with horrid Beard, Is more in poor Alsatia fear'd, Since the stern Parliament of late Has stript of ancient Rights their State: Not Tygers, when their Whelps are missing; Nor Serpents in the Sun-shine hissing; Nor Snake in Tail that carries rattle; Nor Fire, nor Plague, nor Blood, nor Battle, Is half so dreaded by the Throng, As thy vile persecuting Tongue. If e'er the restless Clack that's in it Gives thy Head leave to think a Minute, Think what a Pennance we must bear Thy damn'd Impertinence to hear. Whether I stand, or run, or sit, Thou still art i'th' repeating Fit; Weary'd I seek a Nap to take, But thy curst Muse keeps me awake. At Church too, when the Organ's blowing, Thy louder Pipe is still a going. Nor Park, nor Bagnio's from thee free, All Places are alike to thee. Learn Wisdom once, at a Friend's instance, From the two Fellows at St. Dunstan's; Make not each Man thou meet'st a Martyr; But strike like them but once a Quarter. The 63d Epigram in Martial, Lib. 3. Cotile, Bellus homo es, &amp;c. Oh Jemmy you're a Beau: not I alone Say this, but 'tis the talk of all the Town. Prithee be free, and to thy Friend impart What is a Beau—Ay Sir, with all my Heart. He's one, who nicely curls and comb's his Hair, And visits Sedgwick monthly all the Year: Sings baudy Songs, and humms them, as along Flanting he walks thro' the admiring Throng; All the Day long fits with the charming Fair, And whispers pretty Stories in their Ear. Writes Billets doux; shuns all Men as he goes, Lest their unhallow'd Touch shou'd dawb his Cloaths. He knows your Mistress: Nay, at every Feast He'll tell the Pedigree of every Guest. Is this a Beau? Faith Jemmy, I'll be plain, A Beau's a Bawble, destitute of Brain. The Contented Whore. An Imitation of Epig. 66. in Mar. l. 12. Formosa Phyllis nocte cum mihi tota. I To Charming Cælia's Arms I flew, And there all Night I feasted; No God such Transports ever knew, Nor Mortal ever tasted. II Lost in the sweet tumultuous Joy, And pleas'd beyond expressing; How can your Slave, my Fair, said I, Reward so great a Blessing? III The whole Creation's Wealth survey; Thro' both the Indies wander: Ask what brib'd Senates give away, And fighting Monarchs squander. IV The richest Spoils of Earth and Air; The rifled Ocean's Treasure; 'Tis all too poor a Bribe by far To purchase so much Pleasure. V She blushing cry'd—My Life, my Dear, Since Cælia, thus you fancy, Give her, but 'tis too much, I fear, A Rundlet of right Nancy. An Imitation of Uxor vade foras. In Mart. l. ii. Ep. 105. I Sweet Spouse, you must presently troop and be gone, (Or fairly submit to your betters;) Unless for the Faults that are past, you attone, I must knock off my Conjugal Fetters. II When at Night I am paying the Tribute of Love, (You know well enough what's my Meaning,) You scorn to assist my Devotion, or move, As if all the while you were dreaming. III At Cribbage and Put, and All Fours I have seen A Porter more Passion expressing, Than thou, wicked Kate, in the rapturous Scene, And the Height of the amorous Blessing. IV Then say I to my self, is my Wife made of Stone, Or does the old Serpent possess her; Better Motion and Vigor by far might he shown By dull Spouse of a German Professor? V So Kate take Advice, and reform in good Time, And while I'm performing my Duty, Come in for your Club, and repent of the Crime Of paying all Scores with your Beauty, VI All day thou mayst cant, and look grave as a Nun, And run after Burgess the surly; Or see that the Family business be done, And chide all thy Servants demurely. VII But when you're in Bed with your Master and King, That Tales out of School ne're does trumpet, Move, riggle, heave, pant, clip me round like a Ring, In short, be as lewd as a Strumpet. Mart. Epig. 61. l. 11. Sit Phlogis an Chione Veneri magis apta requiris? I Nothing than Chloe e'er I knew By Nature more befriended: Cælia's less Beautiful, 'tis true, But by more hearts attended. II No Nymph alive with so much art Receives her Shepherd's firing, Or does such cordial drops impart To love when just expiring. III Cold niggard Age, that does elsewhere At one poor offering falter, To her whole Hecatombs wou'd spare, And pay them on her Altar. IV But Chloe, to Loves great disgrace, In Bed nor falls, nor rises, And too much trusting to her face, All other Arts despises. V No half form'd Words, nor murmuring Sighs, Engage to fresh performing Her breathless Lover, when he lies, Disabled after storming. VI Dull as a Prelate when he prays, Or Cowards after listing, The fair Insiensible betrays Loves rites by not assisting. VII Why thus, ye powers that cause our smart, Do ye Love's gifts dissever; Or why those happy Talents part, That shou'd be joyn'd for ever. VIII For once perform an Act of Grace, Implor'd with such Devotion, And grant my Cælia Chloe's Face, Or Chloe Cælia's Motion. To a Gentleman that cut off his Hair, and set up for a Spark in his old Age. Out of Martial. Epig. 43. lib. 3. Mentiris Juvenem, &amp;c. Thou that not many Months ago Wast white as Swan, or driven Snow, Now blacker far than Æsop's Crow, Thanks to thy Wig, set'st up for Beau. Faith Harry, thou'rt in the wrong Box, Old Age these vain Endeavours mocks, And time that knows thou'st hoary Locks, Will pluck thy Mask off with a Pox. The Epigram in Martial L. Imitated. Quæris sollicitus diu, rogasq; Cui tradas, Lupe, filium Magistro, &amp;c. When e'er I meet you, still you cry, What shall I do with Bob, my Boy. Since this Affair you'll have me treat on, Ne'er send the Lad to Pauls or Eaton. The Muses let him not confide in, But leave those Jilts to Tate or Dryden. If, with damn'd Rimes he racks his Wits, Send him to Mevis or St. Kit's. Wou'd you with wealth his Pockets store well, Teach him to pimp, or hold a door well. If he has a head not worth a Stiver, Make him a Curate, or Hog-driver, An Epigram out of Martial imitated Book 3. Epig. 54. Sir Fopling, you're a Man of Fashion grown; The most accomplish'd Blade in all the Town, 'Tis all the Ladies talk; but tell me this, What a fine Man of Mode and Fashion is. 'Tis he that's all the Morning at the Glass, To put each Curle in its most proper place, And in affected Forms to set his Face, That smells of Essence, and the best Perfume, Which does from India or Arabia come. That when one speaks (as if he did not hear) Hums o'er some wanton Song, or modish Air; That Legs and Arms in various Postures throws, And seems to dance at every step he goes, That sits among the Women in the Pit, And that he may be thought a Man of Wit; He Whispers to the next as to a Friend, That in loud Laughter does his whispering End, That reads and writes Love-Letters to and fro, And does each Gallants Wench and Mistress know. Who, tho' unbidden is a constant Guest, At Ev'ry Mask, at ev'ry Treat, and Feast. But sits in Pain for fear the next should stir, And so displace his Dress or Garniture. Who knows New-Market Breed, so well, that he Can tell you Jack-a-Dandy's Pedigree; And down from long Descent pretends to trace The famous Swallows, or Fleet Dragon's Race. How Sir, What's this you say; Is this Buffoon Admir'd so for a Spark throughout the Town? Believe me Sir, on Earth there cannot be A more ridiculous trifling Thing than he. EPIGRAMS. An Epigram under the Picture of a Beau. The vain thing set up for Man, But see what Fate attends him, The poud'ring Barber first began The Barber Surgeon ends him. An extempore Epigram on Death. If Death does come as soon as Breath departs, Then he must often die, who often farts. And if to die; be but to lose one's Breath, Then Death's a Fart, and so a Fart for Death. Thus merrily turn'd over a Glass. The Crab does oft the tufted Ring possess, And crawls unseen about the heav'nly Place; From whose soft Banks the whizing Waters fall, And Show'rs of Love perform the Dev'l and all. But when old Time has stretch'd the Channel wide, And stop'd the Flux of the refreshing Tide, 'Tis Drudg'ry then in such a Pool to sail, One Moment makes us glad to say, Farewel. Mr. Brown's Extempore Version of two Verses out of Martial, occasion'd by a Clamorous Dun, who vow'd she would not leave him 'till she had her Money. Sextus thou nothing ow'st, nothing I say, He something owes that something has to pay. An Epigram by Mr. Tho. Brown. De Parnasso. Thus paraphras'd. O Phœbus! Father of the rhiming Crowd, Doom'd to be poor, yet destin'd to be proud; Bright Ruler both of Poetry and Light; 'Tis true, you give us Wit, but starve us by't. Behold us struggling in those slippery Ways, Which lead from Profit to the Hopes of Praise; That tempting Shadow which such Swarms pursue, Tho' sooth'd by many, merited by few; Yet oft by Fools, and Flatterers enjoy'd, And to the more Deserving still deny'd, But thy Son Homer, liv'd in better Days, And shone in Wit, as glorious as thy Rays; With Honour justly clim'd the lofty Hill, And rul'd with Joy the sacred Pinacle; Where none his ancient Title must dispute, Or after him presume to set a Foot. Inspir'd by these, he took so vast a Flight, That modern Ages ne'er could reach his Height. His Works forbid us to molest his Reign, And shew that all Attempts would prove in vain. Yet since all Ages have their certain Best, And one has Right to tow'r above the rest; God-like, from Cares exempt, I'll sit at Ease, And jest with humane Follies as I please: Ne'er pine in vain, or languish o'er my Wants, But leave to whining Coxcombs such Complaints. And as no earthly Monarch will admit A rival Prince in his Imperial Seat; So o'er Parnassus will I reign as King, And whilst the envious Criticks rail, I'll sing. The bending Arch of Heav'n shall be my Crown, And thus unequall'd, will I rule alone, 'Till more aspiring Wit shall justly claim Apollo's Kingdom, and surmount my Fame. FABLES. The Fable of the Bat and the Birds. In imitation of that of the Buzzard in the Hind and Panther. In the Year 1689. In ancient Times, as learned Æsop shows, 'Twixt Birds and Beasts a fatal War arose. But whether this from State-Intrigues did flow, Or to some Church-Pretence its Birth did owe, Or depredations made, concerns us not to know. Weighty, you may be sure, the Cause was thought Which such an universal Tumult wrought. Picqueering Parties first began the Fray, A sad Presage of the ensuing Day. At last the War was solemnly proclaim'd, The hour of fighting set, and both the Leaders nam'd. The foolish Bat, a Bird obscure and base, The scorn and jest of all the feather'd Race; Or by fantastick Fears, and Scruples led, Or by Ambition mov'd his Party fled, Joyn'd with the Beasts, and eager to engage, With popular Harangues urg'd on a feeble Rage: As Fortune wou'd, on an ill-fated Day, The Beasts drew out their Forces in Array: The different Kinds their Grudges laid aside, And for the common Safety now provide. Ev'n their old Piques, and warm Disputes forgot, The Hind and Panther joyn'd upon the Spot; And by one mutual League of Friendship held, Prepare for the rough Business of the Field. When lo! the Birds in numerous Bands appear, And with repeated Crys attack the Rear; Give a fierce Charge, and back like Parthians, fly, To repossess the patrimonial Sky; Then strait descending, with redoubled Might, They spend their Fury, and renew the Fight. Pale Victory, all trembling and dismay'd, With doubtful Wings the purple Scene survey'd. At last, propitious to her fether'd Kind, Declar'd her Favour, and the Scale inclin'd. Whole Hecatombs the cover'd Field possest. And gave their Foes at once a Triumph and a Feast. Their slaughter'd Young the Rachel-Dams deplor'd, And many a Widdow'd Cow mourn'd o'er her Horned Lord. The generous Eagle (so his Stars ordain) Chases th'affrighted Lyon from the Plain: Their General gone, the Rest like Lightning fly, A cheap unfighting Herd, not worth the Victory. And now the Birds with eager Haste pursue, Thro' Lanes, and devious Tracks, the scatter'd Crew. Among the Rest, beset with Dangers round, The trembling Bat was in a Cellar found: 'Tis pity Fame ne'er Chronicled his Taker, But all Records agree, they found him near Long-acre. Percht on a Pole, they brought him to the Bar, Where the full House sat talking of the War. Strait at the sight, a various Noise began, Which thro' the spacious Hall, and neighb'ring Lobby ran. Each Member in the publick Mirth concurr'd, And droll'd upon the poor Apostatizing Bird. First, Parrot Settle open'd wide his Throat, Next Cuckow Rimer always in a Note; And Peacock Chetwood, of the Clergy kind; But his Poetick Feet disgrac'd the Train behind. And Creech, and Norris, Blackbirds of Renown; And Corm'rant Higden, for devouring known. Nay, to augment the Hardship of his Woes, Owl Durfy clapt his Wings, and hooted in the Close. When now their Raillery began to spare, (And faith 'twas too much for one Bird to bear) The Eagle order'd silence in the Room, And thus aloud pronounc'd the shiv'ring Lubber's Doom. Beast of a Bird, thus to desert thy Friends, And joyn the common Foe, for base ungenerous Ends; What Punishment can suit so black a Crime? Hear then, and stand accurst to all succeeding Time. From all our Diets be thou first expell'd, Or those in flow'ry Groves, or those in Steeples held, When our gay Tribes in youthful Pomp appear, To joyn in Nuptial Bands, and meet the smiling Year. Nay more, to make thee mortifie and grieve, To Buzzard Shadwell we thy Places give. Him we appoint Historian of our State, And Poet Laureat of the Woods create. Outlaw'd our Realms, and banish'd from the Light, Be thou for ever damn'd to steal abroad by Night. The Fable of the Horse and the Stag. I The Horn-arm'd Stag deny'd the Horse The priviledge of the Common, Till starv'd, for want of equal Force, He begg'd Assistance from a Man. II For why? resolv'd at any Rate To get his Share of Pasture; He rather chose to champ the Bit, Than leave the Stag sole Master. III With Man astride he march'd to fight A Foe that durst not face him; For he with Strangeness of the Sight Was frighted from his grazing. IV Nor had Sir Palfry much to brag He got by his Adventure; Since Man, from routing of the Stag, Commenc'd perpetual Centaur. The Fable of the Wolf and Porcupine. In answer to the Argument against a Standing Army. I Isgrim with Hunger prest, one day As through the Woods he posted, A Porcupine found on the Way, And in these Terms accosted. II Our Wars are ended, Heav'n be prais'd, Then let's sit down and prattle Of Towns invested, Sieges rais'd, And what we did in Battle. III The Plains a pleasing Prospect yield, No Fire, nor Desolation; While Plenty reigns in every Field, And Trade restores the Nation. IV Yet you your Quills erected wear, And tho' none seeks to harm ye, In time of Peace about you bear Methinks a Standing Army. V Friend, quoth the Porcupine, 'tis true, The War's at length decided, But 'gainst such tricking Blades as you, 'Tis good to be provided. VI Censorious Fame shall never say That too much Faith betray'd me; Who thinks of me to make a Prey, Must at his Cost invade me. VII Let him, that thinks it worth the while, Tempt Knaves to make a Martyr, The Sharpers, that wou'd me beguile, Shall find they've caught a Tartar. The Fable of Apollo and Daphne. I Apollo once finding fair Daphne alone, Discover'd his Flame in a passionate Tone; He told her, and bound it with many a Curse, He was ready to take her for Better for Worse. Then he talk'd of his Smart, And the Hole in his Heart, So large, one might drive thro' the Passage a Cart. But the silly coy Maid, to the Gods great Amazement, Sprung away from his Arms, and leapt through the Casement. II He following cry'd out, my Life and my Dear, Return to your Lover, and lay by your Fear. You think me perhaps some Scoundrel, or Whoreson, Alas! I've no wicked Designs on your Person. I'm a God by my Trade, Young, plump and well-made, Then let me caress thee, and be not afraid. But still she kept running, and flew like the Wind, While the poor pursy God came panting behind. III I'm the Chief of Physicians; and none of the College Must be mention'd with me for Experience and Knowledge; Each Herb, Flower, and Plant by its Name I can call, And do more than the best Seventh Son of 'em all. With my Powders and Pills, I cure all the Ills, That sweep off such Numbers each Week in the Bills. But still she kept running, and flew like the Wind, While the poor pursy God came panting behind. IV Besides I'm a Poet, Child, into the Bargain, And top all the Writers of fam'd Covent-Garden. I'm the Prop of the Stage, and the Pattern of Wit, I set my own Sonnets, and sing to my Kit. I'm at Will's all the Day, And each Night at the Play; And Verses I make fast as Hops, as they say. When she heard him talk thus, she redoubled her Speed, And flew like a Whore from a Constable freed. V Now had our wise Lover (but Lovers are blind) In the Language of Lumbard-street told her his Mind, Look Lady what here is, 'tis plenty of Money, Odsbobs I must swinge thee, my Joy and my Honey. I sit next the Chair, And shall shortly be Mayor, Neither Clayton nor Duncomb with me can compare. Tho', as wrinkled as Priam, deform'd as the Devil, The God had succecded, the Nymph had been civil. MISCELLANIES. An Elegy on that most Orthodox, and Pains-taking Divine, Mr. Samuel Smith, Ordinary of Newgate, who dy'd of a Quinsey, on St. Bartholomew's Day, the 24th of August, 1698. Tyburn, lament, in pensive sable mourn, For from the World thy ancient Priest is torn. Death, cruel Death, thy learn'd Divine has ended, And by a Quinsey, from his Place suspended. Thus he expir'd in his old Occupation, And as he liv'd, he dy'd, by Suffocation. Thou, reverend Pillar of the tripple Tree, I would say Post, for it was prop'd by thee; Thou Penny-Chronicler of hasty Fate, Death's Annalist, Reformer of the State; Cut-throat of Texts, and Chaplain of the Halter, In whose sage presence Vice it self did faulter. How many Criminals by thee assisted, Old Smith, have been most orthodoxly twisted? And when they labour'd with a dying Qualm, Were decently suspended to a Psalm? How oft hast thou set harden'd Rogues a squeaking, By urging the great Sin of Sabbath-breaking; And sav'd Delinquents from old Nick's Embraces, By flashing Fire and Brimstone in their Faces? Thou wa'st a Gospel-Smith, and after Sentence, Brought'st Sinners to the Anvil of Repentance; And tho' they prov'd obdurate at the Sessions, Could'st hammer out of them most strange Confessions, When Plate was stray'd, and Silver Spoons were missing, And Chamber-maid betray'd by Judas kissing, Thy Christian Bowels chearfully extended Towards such, as by their Mammon were befriended. Tho' Culprit in enormous Acts was taken, Thou would'st devise a way to save his Bacon; And if his Purse could bleed a half Pistole, Legit, my Lord, he reads, upon my Soul. Spite of thy Charity to dying Wretches, Some Fools would live to bilk thy Gallows Speeches. But who'd refuse, that has a taste of Writing, To hang, for one learn'd Speech of thy inditing. Thou alway'st had'st a conscientious itching, To rescue Penitents from Pluto's Kitchen; And hast committed upon many a Soul, A pious Theft, but so St. Austin stole. And Shoals of Robbers, purg'd of sinful Leaven, By thee were set in the high Road to Heaven. With sev'ral Mayors hast thou eat Beef and Mustard, And frail Mince-pyes, and transitory Custard. But now that learned Head in Dust is laid, Which has so sweetly sung, and sweetly pray'd: Yet tho' thy outward Man is gone and rotten, Thy better part shall never be forgotten. While Newgate is a Mansion for good Fellows, And Sternbold's Rhimes are murder'd at the Gallows; While Holborn Cits at Executions gape, And Cut-purse follow'd is by Man of Crape; While Grub-street Muse, in Garrets most sublime, Trafficks in Doggerel, and aspires to Rhime; Thy Deathless Name and Memory shall reign, From fam'd St. Giles, to Smithfield, and Duck-lane. But since thy Death does general Sorrow give, We hope, thou in thy Successor will live. Newgate and Tyburn jointly give their Votes, Thou may'st succeeded be by Doctor Oates. An Epitaph upon that profound and learned Casuist, the late Ordinary of Newgate. Under this Stone Lies reverend Drone, To Tyburn well known; Who preach'd against Sin, With a terrible Grin, In which some may think, that he acted but odly, Since he liv'd by the Wicked, and not by the Godly. In time of great need, In case he were free'd, He'd teach one to read Old Pot-hooks and Scrawls, As ancient as Pauls. But if no Money came, You might hang for old Sam, And founder'd in Psalter, Be ty'd to a Halter. This Priest was well hung, I mean with a Tongue, And bold Sons of Vice, Would disarm in a trice; And draw Tears from a Flint, Or the Devil was in't. If a Sinner came him nigh, With Soul black as Chimney, And had but the Sense To give him the pence, With a little Church-paint He'd make him a Saint. He understood Physick, And cur'd Cough and Ptifick; And in short all the Ills That we find in the Bills, With a sovereign Balm, The World calls a Psalm. Thus his Newgate-birds once, in the space of a Moon, Tho' they liv'd to no Purpose, they dy'd to some Tune, In Death was his Hope, For he liv'd by a Rope. Yet this, by the way, In his praise we may say, That, like a true Friend, He his Flock did attend, Ev'n to the World's end, And car'd not to start From Sledge, or from Cart, 'Till he first saw them wear Knots under their Ear; And merrily swing, In a well-twisted string. But if any dy'd hard, And left no Reward, As I told you before, He'd inhance their old score, And kill them again With his murdering Pen. Thus he kept Sin in awe, And supported the Law; But, oh! cruel Fate! So unkind, tho' I say't, Last week, to our Grief, Grim Death, that old Thief, Alas, and alack, Had the boldness to pack This old Priest on his Back, And whither he's gone, Is not certainly known. But a Man may conclude, Without being rude, That Orthodox Sam His Flock would not sham; And to shew himself to 'em a Pastor most civil, As he led, so he follow'd them all to the D?l. An Elegy in Memory of the Gallant Viscount Dundee, who was killed by a random Shot, after he had won the Battle at Gillecrankey. Writ by Mr. Brown, at the Request of Dr. Griffith and Mr. Burges. Fors &amp; virtus miscentur in unum. Vir. Æneid. 12. Goddess, to urge me on forbear, Or make my mournful Song thy care; Oppress'd with Doubts, and mighty Woe, I'd sing the Man, that all Mankind shou'd know, How brave he fought, how conquer'd, and how fell, And in what Cause assist me whilst I tell. Quickly the News was hither brought, Too true, alas, that he was dead, And all our Expectations fled; But yet we would not entertain the Thought. Between th'extreams of Hope and Fear, Confus'd we stood the Truth to hear, Until 'twas made at last too plain, Beyond all doubt the great unconquer'd Man was slain. Forgive me, Heaven, that impious Thought, At first I question'd your Supreme Decree, Love to my King the Madness wrought, And Grief for the World's Loss, the brave DUNDEE. Oh! frail Estate of Things below, Well to our cost your emptiness we know. Scarce from the fury he had pass'd Of a mistaken factious Race, But other Dangers follow him as fast, And trace him as he goes from Place to Place. His Friends desert, his Foes pursue, Yet still undaunted he goes on; New Dangers but his Mind and Strength renew, So Brave, so Just and Good was this unalter'd Man. Tho' much o'er-match'd in Men and Arms, His Cause and Courage only best, And his Example far above the rest: Firmly resolv'd, he meets the numerous Foe; But first, with chearful Anger in his Face, Soldiers and Friends, he spoke, I'm sure you know, For what Intent, and for whose sake we go; And then he bow'd, and briefly told the Case. His Speech to his Soldiers. A King Entail'd by long Descent, Equal almost to Time in its extent, Robb'd of his Throne, for sure it must be so; Nor God nor Nature can, Only presumptuous Man, Be guilty of so black an Overthrow. What's worse, to palliate the pretence Harmless Religion too is brought, Falsly and indirectly us'd, And all her sacred Mysteries abus'd, Beyond what the dark Sibyls ever taught. And can we bear, my Friends, this great Offence? Can we stand idle by, And see our Mother robb'd, at last condemn'd to die, And not endeavour for some Recompence? Envy and Fraud, Hypocrisie and Pride, And bold Ambition, arm'd for Parricide; The certain loss of Liberty and Laws, And Usurpation, an intolerable Cause. All these and more, have brought us here; Let no Man doubt, let no Man fear, His Cause is Just, and if he falls to day, For so by chance he may. At worst his Name shall wear A large and noble Character; But his exalted Soul shall fly The boundless pitch of vast Eternity. He spoke; his Soldiers much approve, Despair and Fear quit ev'ry Breast, Rage and Revenge their place possess'd: And then with wond'rous Order t'wards the Foe they move. But who th'Amazement and th'Affright can tell, That on the other Army fell? Or who, without Astonishment, can say, The wonderous Things this great Man did that Day? In vain their routed Squadrons fly, In vain aloud for help they cry, The Battle's lost, and they must yield, or die. But, see of Human Things the brittle state! The only best, and best deserving Man, That should have breath'd beyond the common Span, The last that meets Triumphantly his Fate; As he was lifting up his Hand, To give the finishing Command, Comes a malicious random Shot, And struck the Victor dead upon the spot. Methinks I see the wounded Hero lie, Too good to live, and yet to brave to die; I hear him bless his Cause, and more he had to say, But, oh! the hasty Soul could make no longer stay. Unconquer'd Man, farewel! Now thou art gone to dwell Where thou shalt be intirely free, From all the Curses of Mortality. No anxious Thoughs shall wrack thy Breast, No Factions shall disturb thy Rest; Nor shalt thou be by Tyranny oppress'd. Thy Learning and thy Parts, Thy Knowledge in the noblest, useful Arts, Thy Conversation and thy Wit, Spoke thee for Earth unmeet, for Heaven only fit. Live bless'd above, almost invok'd below; Live, and accept this pious Vow, Our Captain once, our Guardian Angel now. Live and enjoy, those great Rewards are due, To those who to their Prince are Faithful, Just and True. The Mourning Poet: Or, The unknown Comforts of Imprisonment, written in the Year, 1703. and Calculated for the Meridian of the three populous Universities of the Queen's Bench, the Marshalsea, and the Fleet; but may indifferenly serve any Prison in the Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, or Town of Berwick upon Tweed. Since my hard Fate has doom'd me to a Jayl, Some scolding Muse direct me how to rail: And let this Curse, by my ill Genius sent, As 'tis my Penance, be my Argument. The Scene of Life with Black and White spread o'er, Here shows us Want, and there superfluous Store. The Rich Man and the Poor be then my Theme; Having been both, I best can judge of them. A Rich Man, what is he? Has he a Frame Distinct from others? Or a better Name? Has he more Legs, more Arms, more Eyes, more Brains? Has he less Care, less Crosses, or less Pains? Can Riches keep the Mortal Wretch from Death? Or can new Treasures purchase a new Breath? Or does Heaven send its Love and Mercy more To Mammon's pamper'd Sons than to the Poor? If not, why should the Fool take so much State, Exalt himself and others under-rate? 'Tis senceless Ignorance that sooths his Pride, And makes him laugh at all the World beside. But when Excesses bring on Gout or Stone, All his vain Mirth and Gayety are gone. Then to make any Truce with his Disease, And purchase the least interval of Ease, He'd all his ill-got Magazines resign, And at Health's Altar Sacrifice his Coin: And when he dies, for all he looks so high, He'll make as vile a Skeleton as I. To number out the several sorts of Poor, Would be to count the Billows on the Shore; My Muse shall therefore all the rest decline, And to th'industrious Man her self confine; Who with incessant Labour strives to live, And yet by cruel Accidents can't thrive. To Trace the Original Fountain of his Woe, From whence the Gross of all his Ills do flow; With War I must begin, whose fatal Doom Ruins all Trade as well Abroad as Home. The dire effects the Merchant feels the first, And all the other Trades by War are curs'd; The Vintners, whom I own I pity most Are daily in this cursed scramble lost. And who can wonder that so many fail, When righteous Claret truckes to vile Ale, And Barcelona stoops to Belgick Mild and Stale. War (to whose Court all lesser Evils join) First help'd to circumcise our Current Coin. 'Twas a fine Harvest, when the Clipping Race, To the conniving Government's disgrace, Cut short his Majesty within the Ring, And dock'd his Horses Tail (God bless the King:) Then Goldsmiths, Scriveners, and the bulky Tribe Of monied Knaves, too num'rous to describe, Batten'd apace on this unrighteous Trade, And at the Realm's expence large Fortune's made; While the poor half-starv'd Slaves that for them wrought, Within the fatal Toil were daily caught; And to relieve them in their Tyburn Qualm, Troop'd off to the dull Musick of a Psalm. The Charge of War out-ballanc'd soon our Trade, As this advanc'd, that palpably decay'd. And as 'twas ten Years War that ruin'd Troy, So ten years War did England's Wealth destroy. War, fatal War, the murderer of Trade, Occasion'd heavy Taxes for its aid; It set Mercurial Heads at work t'invent Most easie ways to serve the Government: NEALE started first, to raise a speedy Sum, A MILLION LOTTERY, let who will come, No Loss can happen, but most certain Gain; Sell Lands and Houses, ne'er was such a Main. This was a general and inviting Bait, And did so luckily relieve the State, That the Groom-Porter had Encouragement, New specious Schemes and Projects to invent. Next, the old Maids and Batch'lers were cajoll'd, Fourteen per Cent. for Life, and well enroll'd: They drew their Cash from Commerce and from Trade, And lavishly adventur'd on this Aid, Long may they live, and still (as now) be paid. At the Heels of this, Survivorship came in, ('Tis hard to stop, tho' easie to begin) From six per Cent. t'increase as Children die, So promising a Fund who wou'd not try? Thus eager Parents paid their Money down, To make their Children Vassals to the Crown, And with much Ceremonie beg their own. At last, resolv'd new Methods still t'explore, As if we ne'er cou'd drain the Nation's store; The Bank peept up, and all before it bore. As Rivers dutifully glide to pay Their liquid Tribute, to their Parent Sea. Nor is it strange; Av'rice is always wise, And Profit, say the Learned, never lies. Int'rest at twelve per Cent. for Stock advanc'd, Stock to One hundred thirty Pounds enhanc'd; So he that had a Thousand Pounds in there, For Thirteen Hundred strait cou'd sell his Share; Prodigious Gain! Such Principal, such Use Th'Exchequer pays; What must th'Exchequer loose? But say, my Muse, what harm was it to Trade, If the Exchequer Cent. per Cent. had paid, When the Realm's wants requir'd a present Aid? It made the Nation's Debt call for Supplies, By doubling both the Customs and Excise; It fram'd the Capitation by Degrees, Births, Burials, Batchelours, Lights, Lawyers Fees, Stock, Money, Titles empty Houses pay, Altho' the Tenants often run away. All these, and many more Inventions joyn'd To pamper War, while sickly Trade declin'd: Set up Stock-jobbers on the Nation's Back, Whose weight compleated poor Britannia's Wreck. These Vermin being hatch'd, the numerous Brood Increas'd, and fatten'd on the Trades-Man's Blood; If Tallies were deliver'd on some Aid, Stock-jobber fixt, what Money shou'd be paid. The Legislators gave Encouragement For Men to work, and trust the Government; But tho' a general Good they thus design'd, Those rav'nons Harpies of the Exchange combin'd To frustrate All; and deaf to th'Nation's Cries, Ev'n our best Laws turn'd into Merchandise; So that poor Trades-Men for a Hundred Pound, For Fifty with these Rascals must compound, Or else to Gaol; their Wants call for supply, And ready Cash at any rate they'll buy: Thus all those Millions given for Supplies, Those Caterpillars still monopolize; And if we find not out some speedy Way To kill these Worms that on our Vitals prey, Commerce, the Nation's Glory, soon will fail, And half our Traders perish in a Jayl. Oh, who can bear to see so many Hands Lie idle, like uncultivated Lands; Devour'd by Want, only to gratify Senseless Revenge, and brutal Cruelty? Rome, whose Imperial sway the World obey'd, Justice the Rule of all her Actions made; And tho' most Nations dreaded her Alarms, Was no less famous for her Laws than Arms. Among the rest this justly claims a place, And let not England think it a Disgrace, The glorious Empress of the World to trace. “The Debtor had one part, the Creditor two; Revenge had nothing, nothing was her due. Credit with us the whole Estate doth seize, And on the wretched Debtor's Body preys; Heav'ns brightest Gift, Compassion's out of Door; And he's a graceless Reprobate that's poor. In France this Law does still maintain a sway, If Trades-Men prove incapable to pay; Six Persons of known Truth and Probity, Make inquest what their whole Estate may be: When this is duly done, two parts of three, They to the Creditor's allotted see: And then one third to th'Debtor is convey'd, That he may have some Stock again to Trade; How worthy praise are such good Acts as these? Considering too there's not a penny Fees. Why should we then our English Laws advance, And scornfully expose the Laws of France? Since Subjects, fellow Subjects can destroy, And rob us of our boasted Liberty. In Holland, if a Creditor thinks fit, His Debtor to a Prison to commit, At his own Charge he must maintain him there, Not let him starve, as Creditors do here. A Prison! Heav'ns, I loath the hated name, Famine's Metropolis, the sink of Shame, A nauseous Sepulchre, whose craving Womb Hourly inters poor Mortals in its Tomb; By every Plague, and every Ill possest, Ev'n Purgatory itself to thee's a Jest; Emblem of Hell, Nursery of Vice, Thou crawling University of Lice: Where Wretches numberless to ease their Pains, With Smoak and Ale delude their pensive Chains. How shall I thee avoid? Or, with what Spell Dissolve th'Enchantment of thy Magic Cell? Ev'n Fox himself can't boast so many Martyrs, As yearly fall within thy wretched Quarters. Money I've none, and Debts I cannot pay Unless my Vermin will those Debts defray. Not scolding Wife, nor Inquisition's worse, Thou'rt ev'ry Mischief cramm'd into one Curse. May we at last the Senate's Mercy find, And breath (what Heav'n bestows on all Mankind; What needy Clowns as well as Monarchs share) The common Benefit of wholsome Air: Then to your Clemency we'll Altars raise, And with united Voice our Benefactors praise. So pray Threescore Thousand. To my Friend Mr. Playford; on the Publication of his second Book of Pills. Friend Harry, to prove that your Thoughts were absurd, For supposing I could not be true to my Word, According to the Promise which I made long ago, At last I have squeez'd out a Couplet or two In the Praise of your Pills, and tho' my Verse late is, Yet believe it's the first that I ever sent Gratis. By my Soul, I've been us'd so to Bolus and Potion, That I'm ready to swoon at a Physical Notion; And if you wou'd lend me, (that's give) a Jacobus: I'm perswaded I cou'd not take Pill ex duobus: However, since yours have no Turpentine Flavour, Nor confine a Man close to his righteous Behaviour, Since no bitter Ingredients give Offence to my Palate, But they please me like Cheese which is toasted or Sallad, I'll quit making Faces, to write Panegyrick, Tho' I'm not half so fit for't as M. for Lyrick. To begin then, pray take it as Thomas his Sentence, Your Pills will ne'er bring one to Stool of Repentance, But will chase away Sorrow, which will hang on our Brows, As a pretty young Girl do's a Batchellor's Vows, Who, at Sight of her Beauty, drowns the Thoughts of Miscarriage, And perjur'd, immediately sets up for Marriage. They're a Cure for a Fav'rite who had addled his Senses, And has lost our Good Word by getting his Princes. The thoughtful Good Statesman, who sits a-la-mort, Because he's remov'd from Council and Court, At the Taste of your Med'cines shall resign up his Grief, And bless his Retirement, and bless your Relief. All Conditions and Sexes, in Country and City From thee wou'd be thought Wise, to the really Witty, From the Lady who speaks all her Words as in Print, And has Eyes which strike Fire like a Steel and a Flint. To the Damsel whose Language is course as her Skin, And who fain wou'd be dabling, but starts at the Sin, As she stares at and covets the Thing call'd a Man, And she thinks she cou'd do what her Ladyship can: From the Prodigal Cit, who's a setling the Nation, To the poor Country Thresher, who's as great in his Station. From their Squireships and Knighthoods, and Lordships and Graces, To the Man of no Title, who makes 'em wry Faces. All alike shall be purg'd by your Laxative Verses, Which shall loosen their Tongues instead of their Arses, As they joyn in the Praises of what I commend, And acknowledge you theirs, as I own you my Friend. London, June 28. 1700. T. Brown. Upon the Encampment at Hounslow-Heath. Too long by flowing luxury betraid, Our British Isle was in loose Slumbers laid; Too long we felt the Ills of Fatal peace, And idly Languish'd in inglorious Ease, No manly Business did our Thoughts engage To purchase Fame on Europe's Wondring stage; But grown unmindful of our former Name We all our Fathers Triumphs did disclaim, While even France it self with Scorn beheld our Shame. The idle Spear hung up, the polisht Shield Forgot the great Atchievements of the Field, The gen'rous Sword contracted filthy Rust, And active Pikes lay Mouldering in the dust. Shrill Trumpets spake not to the Armed throng, Our Instruments unlearn'd each Martial song, While Guns and Bombs as useless did appear, As laws and learning in the times of War: Mean-while our Neighbours strove to break the Chain And sought the Empire of fair Albion's Main, Bold num'rous suitors briskly did prepare, To court the Nymph with all the Pomp of War. Nay more, the Eastern World our Shame must know And rifled Bantam English Conduct show, While the Proud Dutch by Potent Nants inspir'd, Invade our Coasts, and on the Castles fir'd: Spain that was much amaz'd at such a sight, Suspected now the Truth of eighty Eight. And scarcely thought our Fathers could obtain, Such great, and glorious Triumphs over Spain. Thus were we Scorn'd, and thus contemn'd abroad; While Seeds of civil Feuds at home were sow'd, Prompted by each bold Instrument of Hell, Dull fools we did, for Conscience sake rebel, Then Sensless clamours all our Thoughts employ'd, And Whig, and Tory did the Land divide. But now Triumphant James the Scepter sways The adoring World our rising Sun surveys, He to our Minds new Vigor does infuse, And furnish ample Matter for the Muse; He to it self our Island does restore, Extends its Limits, and confirms its Pow'r, While the great Edwards mighty Ghost is pleas'd To see his ancient Kingdoms honour rais'd. Behold how Shining in your Martial pride Our Troops at Hounslow doe your Coursers guide, See how the well-form'd Phalanx does advance, Taught by experience; not inspir'd by chance; See how the Colours Wanton in the Air, And helmets glisten formidable fair, See groves of pointed Spears do move along, As Trees Commanded by the Thracian Song, While Drums, and Trumpets rend the listning Skies, And ev'ry Heart keeps Measure with the Noise. Surely, if Poets prophecies are true These Heroes must unheard of Wonders do, Either proud France must now fresh Vengeance feel, And once more groan beneath the English Steel, Or perjur'd Holland some revolving day, For fam'd Amboyna's fatal Slaughters pay, Or the the large Kingdoms of the pow'rful West, Too much by Spanish cruelties opprest, With English Arts at last, and English Laws be blest. Upon the setting up of the Statue of Queen Elizabeth, of ever blessed Memory, in the Royal Exchange London. Let Memnon's Statue be no more admir'd, That utter'd Sounds, by the Suns beams inspir'd; My Muse a greater Wonder does rehearse For Stones have here infus'd the Lofty verse. Oh! London, the just Pride of Albion's Isle, That dost with Ease and flowing Plenty smile, Whose pow'rful Ships the Ocean do Survey, And make both Indies to thee Tribute pay. Oh! give fresh Honours to Eliza's Name, And view the lasting Trophies of her Fame, She rais'd thy Head, and all thy Wealth secur'd, Which else Proud Spaniards rapine had devour'd; She chas'd thy Night of Ignorance away, And soon restor'd truths incorrupted Ray. Nor were her Blessings to this Realm confin'd, Strangers enjoy'd the Vertues of her Mind: Holland half ruin'd by the Pride of Spain, By her kind Influence rais'd it self again; She Freed 'em from the Tyranny of Rome, And stopt the tide of Heav'ns impending Doom. Even France it self with Civil Tumults stain'd, Invok'd her help, and help was Streight obtain'd, Else the curst League had clipt the Royal Crown, And from his greatness thrown the Monarch down. Who without Joy and Wonder can Survey, The Glorious Triumphs of that happy day, When mighty Drake opposed the Power of Spain And fought their Navy in the British Main: Long had Proud Philip, England's Fate conspir'd, Urg'd by revenge, and with Ambition fir'd; Long had he strove by all the Arts of Pow'r Old Rome's exploded Errors to restore, Then reverend Shrines were of their reliques stript, And Consecrated Guns and Daggers shipt; Each banner was baptiz'd in Holy Oil, And vows were made to recommend the Toil; The mitred Prelate of St. Peter's Chair Club'd towards the Work, and blest it with a Pray'r. Nay griping Priests, that never gave before, Now plunder'd Altars to encrease the Store. Thus setting forth from Lisbon's Fatal Bay Through wond'ring Waves the Navy cut its Way; The World amaz'd lookt on the curst intent, And Fate now almost doubted the event. But Britains Genius not surpriz'd with Fear, Towards the great Fleet its nimble course did steer. The roaring Guns first Complements did make, At which the frightned Gallies 'gan to quake; Soldiers like Mag-pies flutt'd in the air, And every Ship did in the damage Share: Till half consum'd with Streams of glowing Fire, The Gen'ral thought it Prudence to retire. These Triumphs we to great Eliza owe, Such Blessings her soft Influence did bestow, Sh' enrich'd our Island with the Indian Mine, And first reduc'd Religion and our Coyn: O may She live exalted in her Fame, Enjoying all the Glories of her Name; While British Fleets the Ocean shall command, And Peace, and plenty Crown our happy Land, While true Religion do's her Sway maintain Against the Arts of Fraud, and Cruelties of Spain. In Praise of the Bottle. A Song. I What a Pox d'ye tell me of the Papists Design? Would to God you'd leave talking, and drink off your Wine. Away with your Glass, Sir, and drown all Debate; Let's be loyally merry; ne'er think of the State. The King (Heav'ns bless him) knows best how to rule; And who troubles his Head, I think's but a Fool. II Come, Sir, here's his Health; your Brimmer advance; We'll ingross all the Claret, and leave none for France. 'Tis by this we declare our Loyal Intent, And by our Carousing, the Customs augment. Would all mind their Drinking, and proper Vocation, We should ha' none of this Bustle and Stir in the Nation. III Let the Hero of Poland, and Monarch of France, Strive, by Methods of Fighting, their Crowns to advance. Let Chappels in Lime-street be built or destroy'd, And the Test, and the Oath of Supremacy, void; It shall ne'er trouble me; I'm none of those Maggots, That have whimsical Fancies of Smithfield and Faggots. IV Then banish all groundless Suspicions away; The King knows to govern, let us learn to obey. Let ev'ry Man mind his Bus'ness and Drinking; When the Head's full of Wine, there's no room left for thinking. 'Tis nought but an empty and whimsical Pate, That makes Fools run giddy with Notions of State. The Rover. A Song. I I hate the Dotard, that restrains Himself to one. Give me the Spark That ev'ry single Doe disdains, But bravely chases all the Park. What Charms can one pretend? She's fair, Well-shap'd perhaps, plays well, or sings. All's true; but were she yet more rare, The God of Love, you know, has Wings. II Beauty's dispers'd through all the Kind; Through all the Universe does move; And 'till it be to one confin'd, I think I've lawful Cause to rove. To Day this Face delights my Eye, But when I'm ask'd not to give o'er; Your Servant; I've fed heartily. Surfeits are dangerous. Not a Bit more. The Campaign. A Song. I Mount, my Boys, mount; let us view the Campaign; At Hounslow the Tents do cover the Plain. Hark! the Trumpets sound, the Troopers are hors'd, If you stay longer, the Sight will be lost. Hark too! the Hautboys; the Grenadiers come; Now in the Rear march the Foot with the Drums. Haste, Gentlemen, haste, our Friends will present's With a kind Bottle and Wench in their Tents. II See yonder, Sir, see how dazling they shew? Their Cloaths, Hats and Arms, are brandishing new. How dreadfully look the Bag'nets advanc'd! How proudly those Jennets before 'em do prance! See how the Housings and Trappings do blaze! How admiring Crowds upon 'em do gaze! Whigs and old Rebels are dash'd at the Sight; They curse in their Hearts, and view 'em with Spight. III Now, now we are there; yon's the General's Tent; All that long Row's for the Queen's Regiment; Yonder's the Sutler's; and there the Smiths stand, With Anvils and Forges all ready at hand. O Windsor and Hounslow! I hope your Stock's large, You're like to maintain an Infantry Charge. The Strollers o'th' Strand and Park will come down, And leave at the Camp, what they got in the Town. The Libertine. A Song. I I'll languish no more at the Glance of your Eye; Can view you all o'er, and ne'er fetch a deep Sigh. No more shall your Voice, Cyren-like, charm my Heart. In vain you may sigh, use in vain all your Art. No, Madam, I'm free; when I'm recreant again, Let me, unpity'd feel again my old Pain. II I'll Libertine turn, use all things in common; No more than one Dish be bound to one Woman; Yet I'll still love the Sex, but my Bottle before 'em; I'll use 'em sometimes, but I'll never adore 'em. Go, Madam, be wise: when a Woodcock's i'th' Noose, Be sure hold him fast, lest like me he gets loose. A Catch. Let the amorous Coxcomb adore a fair Face; An Hours Enjoyment makes him look like an Ass. Let the ambitious Fop to Honours aspire, He burns with the Torment of boundless Desire. And let the old Miser hoard up his curs'd Pelf, He enriches his Bags, but he beggars himself. The Lover, Ambitious, and Miser, are Fools; There's no solid Joy, but in jolly full Bowls. A Match for the Devil. In Imitation of M. Rabelais. While others idle Tales relate, To fright Men from the marry'd State; Do thou, my Muse in humble Verse, The Vertues of a Wife rehearse. A Farmer of much Wealth possess'd, With Friends too, while they lasted, bless'd, Kept open House, and lov'd to feast Those who deserv'd and wanted least. To Pleasures he prescrib'd no Bounds; He kept his Hunters, Pack of Hounds. Somewhat lascivious, somewhat vain. Some Gentleman had cross'd the Strain. To try all Joys and Plagues of Life, He boldly took a Buxom Wife. Now fresh Expences, fresh Delights, Attend the Day, and Crown the Nights. His new Acquaintance Crowd the House; Some praise the Fare, but most the 'Spouse; Each strove who should divert the most, But still 'twas at the Husband's Cost. He, thoughtless, prais'd the expensive Pleasure, To please his dear domestick Treasure, All Care was scorn'd, and Bus'ness vanish'd; The present Joys, thoughts future banish'd: And being both of Years but Vernal, They thought their Wealth and Loves eternal. But oh! how vain are all Mens Fancies! Ill-grounded Projects, mere Romances. What Whims the Wisest entertain! What strange Delusions fill our Brain! When we are eager to possess, We smooth the Road to Happiness: We level Mountains, empty Seas, And Reason fierce Desires obeys. The greatest Danger we despise; Our Passion sees, and not our Eyes. Our Pair now find, some Seasons past, Nor Wealth, nor Love would always last, Unless improv'd with Application; But that in one is out of Fashion. Gold indeed preserves its Sway, But Love! who does thy Pow'r obey? E'en Women now profess to range, And all their Pleasures is in Change; Now seek the present Joys t'improve, Yielding to many they call Love; Artful new Lovers to engage. Then slight his Love, and scorn his Rage. Thus these behold what they possess'd, And wonder how they once were blest. Their Jars are thought on, and improv'd; They hate themselves, that once they lov'd. Thus lab'ring on in dirty Road, They snarl, and curse the heavy Load. How happy were our mortal State, Were Indolence but our worst Fate! No sooner Joys the Place forsake, But racking Pains Dominion take, No sooner Love had fled the Pair, When enter'd meager Want and Care. The House, which had such vast Resort When Riot seem'd to keep his Court, Is now forsook, a lonely Cell, Where Silence, undisturb'd, might dwell. Clean Pans and Spits the Walls now grac'd. For Ornament the Pewter's plac'd. Bright Dishes entertain the Eye. No Kitchen-Smoke offends the Sky. Hogsheads with dismal sounds complain'd, Both Hogsheads and the Man were drain'd. His Landlord stern, his Rent demands. Stray'd are his Flocks, unplough'd his Lands. The Wife advies Friends to try; Her's she was sure would not deny. A thousand Vows she had receiv'd; Each Vow repay'd, for she believ'd, But oh! how soon did they discover, 'Tis Wealth brings Friends, the Face a Lover. His Wants are heard without Relief; Her Eyes afford not Joy, nor Grief. His wasted Fortune all affrights; Her faded Beauty none invites. Oppress'd with Wants, to Woods he flies, And seeks the Peace his House denies. Roving, lamenting his Condition, Fate kindly sent him a Physician. His Habit, Cane, and formal Face, Shew'd he was of Geneva Race: But cloven Feet the Fiend detect, And prov'd him Author of the Sect. With Joy he spy'd the Wretch's Cares, And fawning, thus he spread his Snares. My Son! with Pity I have seen (Tho' I've a Foe to Pity been) The sad Disasters you endure, That of a Wife admits no Cure. I know your Wants, and her's I guess; I cannot swear I'll both redress. That Task, I fear, is too uneasy; But if Possessions large will please ye, Behold this spacious Tract of Land, All that you see's at my Command. I'll give it freely all to thee, If we on Articles agree. I can perform it, I'm the Devil,— Nay, never start Man, I'll be civil. It shall be yours to plough and sow; All that above the Ground does grow, What e'er it is, shall be my Due; The rest I freely give to you. Gladly the Farmer does submit, For pinching Want hath taught him Wit. With Roots he plants the fruitful Soil, Which well rewarded all his Toil. But to his Landlord's jilted Share, A weedy Harvest does appear. The Devil vext, new Cov'nants makes, Next Year all under Ground he takes. Then Golden Wheat the Land does bear, And useless Roots are Satan's Share. The Fiend resolv'd to spoil the Jest, And thus the Farmer he addrest. Believe me, Friend, thou art a Sharper; Satan himself has caught a Tartar, I've seen thy Wit, but now at length I am resolv'd to try thy Strength. A scratching Match we'll have together; Look to thy self, I'll claw thy Leather. If I submit, the Land is thine; If I o'ercome, thy Soul is mine. Think for your Quiet, I conjure ye; Should you to Hell, you leave a Fury. Observe these Talons, and away, And Friday next shall be the Day. A mod'rate Beauty will inflame, 'Till we have seen a brighter Dame. Rivers with Wonders we survey, 'Till we behold the boundless Sea. So ev'ry little trifling Care Appears a Load we cannot bear. But if some horrid Tortures seize us, What late we dreaded, now would ease us. The wretched Farmer homeward goes, And dreads his future endless Woes. His Cares, his Dunns, his Wants, his Wife, And all the Banes of happy Life, Would now afford him vast Content, Could he the unequal Match prevent. His prying Turtle quickly guest Some Care uncommon fill'd his Breast. Husband and Wife, sometimes relate Their Cares and Bus'ness, tho' they hate. Nor always Nature's Call deny, And tho' both loath, yet both comply. Her wheedling Tongue soon found the Means To make the Wretch disclose his Pains. He tells the Combat and the Laws, And magnifies his monst'rous Paws. Pish! Is this all that Plagues your Mind? An easy Remedy I'll find. You to your Wife's Advice submit, And we'll the Devil himself out-wit. Come, turn about,—and leave your Moans,— These Husbands are such very Drones.— He sigh'd, obey'd, and did his best; His Task perform'd he went to rest. Our happy Hours are quickly past, And time to Misery makes haste. Soon Friday comes, a dismal Day! When such a Guest would Visits pay. The Farmer dreads the approaching Scuffle; (The Thoughts of Hell, the Boldest ruffle) But still his Wife keeps up her Spirits; She knew her Safe-guard, and its Merits: She bids him hide, whate're should fall on't, While she receiv'd the dreadful Gallant. He soon obeys th'advent'rous Dame; The Husband gone, the Devil came. Who knocks impetuous at the Gate, And angry grows, that he should wait. Again for Ent'rance loud he cries, But Screams and Groans are the Replies. Love and the Devil, what can bind! They stronger grow, the more confin'd: If they can 'spy the smallest Hole, One takes the Heart, and one the Soul. So Satan, vex'd at the Delay, Whip'd thro' the Key-hole to his Prey; But to his great Amazement, found Th'indecent Wife spread on the Ground: High as the Waste expos'd and bare, And with her Shrieks she pierc'd the Air. Why, how now, Woman? Whence this Passion? This Posture, and such Exclamation? Ah! pity, Sir, my wretched Case, And quickly fly this horrid Place. You, by your grim, Majestick Air, Your Feet, your Claws, your Horns declare; You with my Husband come to scratch; But thou, ah! thou, th'unequal Match! The cruel Monster ready stands, But hope not to escape his Hands: His Nails are Scythes upon my Life, And for his Horns, Sir,—I'm his Wife. This Morn, to try what he could do, On me he would his Prowess shew: This Chasm he made with's little Finger; Behold, Sir,—is it not a Swinger. With that she threw her Legs aside, And shew'd a Hole surprising wide, Zounds, quoth the Devil, (quite amaz'd, When on the deadly Gulph he gaz'd) What do I see! What makes that Wound Of such Extent, and so profound! If that Nail such a Wound could tear, What can the Force of ten Claws bear! And by the Stench, to shew his Spite, With poyson'd Weapons he would fight. My Talons are not half so long, Nor is my Sulphur half so strong. No, I'll submit, since my Lot's Hell; At least I'll in a whole Skin dwell. The Land is his, but be he bound, Since he has made, to fill that Wound. With that he vanish'd from her Eyes, And sulph'rous Stench and Fumes arise. The Farmer hastens to the Place, His great Deliv'rer to embrace. Well hast thou freed my tim'rous Soul; But what did e'er thy Pow'r controul? The fiercest Rage it soon disarms, Tho' Hell it frights, yet Men it charms. But be it on thy Tomb engrav'd, 'Tis the first Soul a Wife e'er sav'd. The Whet. Wine, Wine in a Morning Makes us frolick and gay, That like Eagles we sore In the Pride of the Day. Gouty Sots of the Night Only find a Decay. 'Tis the Sun ripes the Grape, And to Drinking gives Light; We imitate him, When by Noon, we are at Height; They steal Wine, who take it When he's out of fight. Boy, fill all the Glasses, Fill them up now he shines, The higher he rises, The more he refines; For Wine and Wit fall As their Maker declines. Song. [Who their Passions do fondly conceal] I Who their Passions do fondly conceal, They are Fools for their Pains; 'Tis a Confidence gains, What a modest Intriegue never wins. Court briskly but once, and you'll presently find, There's nothing than Woman, than Woman, so kind. II Then gently, good Madam, comply, And seem not to say, That you rather would stay; If you do, I shall tell you, you lye; For you know, had not Eve with her Charms brought him to't, The old Man had ne'er tasted, ne'er tasted the Fruit. On Sternhold and Hopkins, and the New Version of David's Psalms. Ye scoundrel old Bards, and a Brace of dull Knaves, What a plague makes ye mutter, and talk in your Graves? Sure ye drank in your Porridge, like a Couple of Sots, And have mix'd the Spoon-meat with the Belch of the Pots; Or the Worms had by this Time, if they had any Conscience, Stopp'd the Tongues of those Fools who made David speak Nonsence. Ye write, and be damn'd t'ye! Ye traffick in Metre! Why, a Baudy-house Tonge has a Voice that is sweeter: A White-Fryar Sinner, or a Saint in Duck-Lane, A Crowders-Well Sonnet, or a Pye-Corner Strain, Has Raptures and Flights, full of Judgment, and taking When compar'd to the things ye call Psalms of your making. Shame on ye, for Coxcombs, away with this Riot, And rot on, like the rest, who lie by ye in quiet; Nor dare to presume to petition and squable, When there's none takes your Part, but the ignorant Rabble. As for David, for God's sake, how dare ye to name him? When your wretched Translations so damnably shame him? Poor Psalmist! he frets, and he storms, and he stares, Bemoans his Composures, and renounces his Pray'rs; Blushes more at the Dress which his Penitence hath on, Than when told of his Faults by the Prophet old Nathan. So chang'd are his Lines, and so murder'd each Sentence, So debauch'd his God's Praise, and so lame his Repentance. That to know the good King by the Words ye create him, Is a thing much more hard, than it is to translate him. Let me tell you, grave Dons, I'll be bold to assure ye, It is well that this Warrier lies buried in JURY; Had he laid near the Place, which at present contains, Of the two sorry Sinners, the stupid Remains, 'Tis a Pound to a Penny, but his Ashes would fly on, And handle your Skulls like the Bear and the Lion. But for fear I should dwell on the Subject too long, And the Dulness I laugh at, be seen in my Song; Lest the Muse should turn Jade, and, by Sympathy led, Take part of the Scandal sh' has flung on the Dead; I'll no more of your Canting, and Whining, and Chiming. Your Elizaebth Phrase, and your Farthingal-Rhiming, Brought in Use as a Covert to Nonsence, I'll tell ye, As that righteous Queen's Dress was to hide a Great Belly. But tho' the loud Rabble should never deny ye; Confirm'd in their Purpose, and resolv'd to stand by ye; Tho' the poor Ones should murmur, and doat on your Sense, For want of due Thinking, and for want of the Pence; Tho' the stiff Parish Clerks, with their Bands and their Gowns, Read the New Psalms with Hums, and with Ha's, and with Frowns, Cause the Levites, their Masters, by Chance are afraid Innovation should turn to a Practice and Trade; And by those Means, the Godly Wise-Acres be driven From their Desks and their Pulpits, their Sloth and their Haven; Tho' the Stationers strive all they can to decry 'em, And Took swears, that thousands of old Ones lie by 'em: Tho' the late Version fails of the Spirit and Force Of DAVID's Rejoycings, or DAVID's Remorse; Yet I'm not such a Coxcomb, 'sted of new Psalms, to learn Old, Or to quit TATE and BRADY, for Hopkins and Sternhold. A Translation of Lesbia, Mi dicit semper male. Out of Catullus. I Each Moment of the long-liv'd Day Lesbia for me does backwards pray, And rails at me sincerely; Yet I dare pawn my Life, my Eyes, My Soul, and all that Mortals prize, That Lesbia loves me dearly. II Why shou'd you thus conclude, you'll say, Faith 'tis my own beloved Way, And thus I hourly prove her; Yet let me all those Curses share That Heav'n can give, or Man can bear, If I don't strangely love her. A Song in Ridicule of a famous Musician, who was caught serenading his Mistress with his Base-Viol, in a very frosty Night. Look down, fair Garretteer, bestow One Glance upon your Swain, Who stands below, in Frost and Snow, And shaking, sings in Pain. Thaw, with your Eyes, the frozen Street, Or cool my hot Desire; I burn within, altho' my Feet Are numb'd for want of Fire. Chorus, the Viol leading. Thrum, thrum, thrum, thrum, Come, come, come, come, My dearest be not coy; For if you are, (Zit, zan, zounds) I Must without your Favours die. Behold me from your lofty Tow'r, And, to your Lover, shew Your Charms; and when it's in my Pow'r, I'll be as kind to you. Hither I came, with joyful Speed, And fear'd no freezing Wind; But as the Saint at Troas did, Have left my Cloak behind. Chorus. Thrum, &amp;c. My Dear, would you but open wide The Casement with your Hand, My Fiddle, and my self beside, Should be at your Command. Could I behold you in your Smock, Tho' dark, the lusheous View Would then embolden me to knock, And ask you how you do. Chorus. Thrum, &amp;c. Or would you open but the Door, As I have done my Case, I've sweeter Instruments in Store, To play a thorough Base. But since you're coy, I know not what To farther sing or say, My Love, 'tis true, is very hot, Yet I'm too cold to stay. Chorus at going off. Thrum, thrum, thrum, thrum, Home, home, home, home, I hate a Whore that's coy; But since you are, (Zit, zan, zounds) I Must without your Favours die. The Good Fellow. I While the pious grave Sot does amuse half the Nation With impertinent Scruples, and Zeal out of Fashion; While Harangues that at Church made us piously sleep, 'Mongst Priest-ridden Cullies, such a Pother do keep; We'll with trusty Champain our Devotion refine, And shew a good Conscience by drinking our Wine. II Let the motly dull Herd for Religion engage; Let 'em urge the Dispute with vile Clamour and Rage; Let your Authors keep on the dull Method of Writing, And pursue the curs'd Toil they take so much Delight in. We ne'er make Replies, but rest fully contented, Tho' good Fellows and Drink, have been misrepresented. III May their musty stiff Volumes to Grub-street adjourn, Or rot in Duck-Lane, or in Coffee-house burn; May they furnish no more empty Cits with Debate, Or touch the Intrigues and Arcana's of Seate. Wine does edify more, than dull Canting of Vicar; 'Tis our Freedom we owe to that orthodox Liquor. IV I ne'er pall my Fancy, or trouble my Brain With the Chances and Fate that our Stars will ordain; Let the Monarch of France keep his Subjects at Home, And forbid the mad Zealots abroad for to roam, So he lets his boon Claret but cross the kind Main, We shall never be angry, we shall never complain. V Ne'er tell me of those, that with factious Notion Infect the wild Rabble, and poison Devotion; That Mortal is guilty of a far greater Sin, That presumes, with vile Stum, to debauch honest Wine. Such impious Wretches, may Poverty seize on, 'Tis against our Liege Bacchus the highest of Treason. Commendatory Verses on the Author of the two Arthurs, and the Satyr against Wit. By several Hands, and collected by Mr. Brown. A short and true History of the Author of the Satyr against Wit. By Col. Codrington. By Nature meant, by Want a Pedant made, Bl?re at first profess'd the Whipping-trade; Grown fond of Buttocks, he would lash no more, But kindly cur'd the A?he gall'd before. So Quack commenc'd; then fierce with Pride, he swore, That Tooth-ach, Gripes, and Corns should be no more. In vain his Drugs, as well as Birch, he try'd, His Boys grew Blockheads, and his Patients dy'd. Next, he turn'd Bard, and mounted on a Cart, Whose hideous Rumbling made Apollo start; Burlesqu'd the bravest, wisest Son of Mars, In Ballad-Rhimes, and all the Pomp of Farce. Still he chang'd Callings, and at length has hit On Bus'ness for his matchless Talent fit, To give us Drenches for the Plague of Wit. Upon the Author of the Satyr against Wit. By Sir Charles Sidley. A grave Physician us'd to write for Fees, And spoil no Paper, but with Recipes, Is now turn'd Poet, rails against all Wit, Except that little found among the Great? As if he thought true Wit and Sense were ty'd To Men in Place, like Avarice or Pride. But in their Praise so like a Quack he talks, You'd swear he wanted for his Christmas-box. With Mangl'd Names, old Stories he pollutes, And to the present Time, past Actions suits. Amaz'd we find, in ev'ry Page he writes, Members of Parliament, with Arthur's Knights. It is a common Pastime to write ill; And Doctor, with the rest, e'en take thy fill. Thy Satyr's harmless; 'tis thy Prose that kills, When thou prescrib'st thy Potions, and thy Pills. To that incomparable Panegyrist, the Author of the Satyr upon Wit. By Coll. Bl?. Henceforth no more in thy Poetick Rage, Burlesque the God-like Heroes of the Age; No more King Arthurs be with Labour writ, But follow Nature, and still rail at Wit, For this thy mighty Genius was design'd; In this thy Cares a due Success may find. Opinions we more easily receive From Guides, that practise by those Rules they give. So Dullness thou may'st write into Esteem; Thy great Example, as it is thy Theme. Hope not to join (like G???rth's immortal Lays) The keenest Satyr with the best of Praise. Thy Satyrs bite not, but like Æsop's Ass, Thou kick'st the Darling whom thou would'st caress. Would'st thou our Youth from Poetry afright, 'Tis wisely done, thy self in Verse to write. So drunken Slaves the Spartans did design Should fright their Children from the Love of Wine, Go on, and rail as thou hast done before. Thus Lovers use, when picqu'd in an Amour; The Nymph they can't enjoy, they call a Whore. The Quack corrected; or, Advice to the Knight of the Ill favour'd Muse. By the Right Honourable the Earl of ? Let Bl????re still, in good King Arthur's Vein, To Fleckno's Empire his just Right maintain. Let him his own to common Sense oppose, With Praise and Slander, maul both Friends and Foes; Let him great Dr?d?n's awful Name prophane, And learned G?rth with envious Pride disdain; Codron's bright Genious with vile Puns lampoon, And run a Muck at all the Wits in Town; Let the Quack scribble any Thing but Bills, His Satyr wounds not, but his Physick kills. To the merry Poet after at Sadler's-Hall in Cheapside. By Dr. ? Unweildy Pedant, let thy awkward Muse With Censures praise, with Flatteries abuse. To lash, and not be felt, in thee's an Art; Thou ne'er mad'st any, but thy School-boys smart. Then be advis'd, and scribble not agen; Thou'rt fashion'd for a Flail, and not a Pen. If B?l's immortal Wit thou would'st decry, Pretend 'tis he that writ thy Poetry. Thy feeble Satyr ne'er can do him Wrong, Thy Poems and thy Patients live not long. An equal Match; or, a drawn Battle. By Col. Codrington. A monument of Dullness to erect, B?y should write, and Bl?re correct, Like which, no other Piece can e'er be wrought, For Decency of Stile, and Life of Thought; But that where B?y shall in Judgment sit, To pare Excrescencies from Bl?re's Wit. To the Mirrour of British Knighthood, the worthy Author of the Satyr against Wit: Occasion'd by the Hemistick, Pag. 8. By Richard Steel, Esq; —Heav'ns guard poor A???n. Must I then passive stand? and can I hear The Man I love, abus'd, and yet forbear? Yet much I thank thy Favour to my Friend, 'Twas some Remorse thou did'st not him commend. Thou do'st not all my Indignation raise; For I prefer thy Pity, to thy Praise. In vain thou would'st thy Name, dull Pedant hide; There's not a Line but smells of thy Cheapside. If Cæsar's Bounty for your Trash you've shar'd, You are not the first Assassine he has spar'd. His Mercy, not his Justice, made thee Knight, Which P?rt?r may demand with equal Right. Well may'st thou think an useless Talent Wit; Thou, who without it, ha'st three Poems writ: Impenitrably dull, secure thou'rt found, And can'st receive no more, than give a Wound: Then scorn'd by all, to some dark Corner fly, And in Lethargick Trance, expiring lie, 'Till thou from injur'd G??rth thy Cure receive, And S??d only Absolution give. To the Cheapside Kt. on his Satyr against Wit. By Mr. William Burnaby. Some scribling Fops so little value Fame, They sometimes hit, because they never aim. But thou for erring, ha'st a certain Rule, And, aiming, art inviolably dull. Thy muddy Stream, no lucid Drop supplies, But Puns like Bubbles on the Surface rise, All that for Wit you could, you've kindly done; You cannot write, but can be writ upon. And a like Fate does either side befit, Immortal Dulness, or immortal Wit. In just Extreams an equal Merit lies, And B?le and G???rth with thee must share the Prize, Since thou can'st sink, as much as they can rise. To the indefatigable Rhimer. By Dr. Smith. O! S???rs, T???t, D???ett, M???gue, G???y, S???ld, C???sh, P???ke, V???n, you, Who suffer Bl???re to insult your Taste, And tamely hear him bluster in Bombast, Bid him, before he dare to write agen, Resign his own, and take some other Pen. D???n shall Numbers, C???ve Wit inspire, Dr???ke nicest Rules, but B???le and Codron Fire. Then G???rth shall teach him, and his witless Tribe, First to write Sense, and after to prescribe. The unlearn'd Pedant thus may please the Town, But his own nauseous Trash will ne'er go down; For naught can equal what the Bard has writ, But R???ff's Scholarship, and G???n's Wit. A modest Request to the Poetical Knight. By Col. Codrington. Since B???y's Nonsense to out-do, you strive, Vain to be thought the dullest Wretch alive, And such in imitable Strains have writ, That the most famous Blockheads must submit; Long may you Reign, and long unenvy'd live, And none invade your great Prerogative. But in Return, your Poetry give o'er, And persecute poor Job, and us no more. Wholesome Advice to a City Knight, over-run with Rhimes and Hypocrisie: Occasion'd by his Satyr against Wit. By the Right Honourable the Earl of Anglisea. We bid thee not give o'er the Killing-Trade: Whilst Fees come in, 'tis fruitless to disswade. Religion is a Trick you've practis'd long, To bring in Pence, and gull the gaping Throng. But all thy Patients now perceive thy Aim, They find thy Morals and thy skill the same. Then, if thou would'st thy Ignorance redress, Prithee mind Physick more, and Rhiming less. To a thrice illustrious Quack, Pedant, and Bard, on his incomparable Poem, call'd, A Satyr against Wit. By the Right Hon. the Countess of Sandwich. Thou Fund of Nonsense, was it not enough, That Cits and pious Ladies lik'd thy Stuff, That as thou copy'dst Virgil, all might see, Judicious Bell-men imitated thee: That to thy Cadence, Sextons set their Chimes, And Nurses, skimming Possets hum'd thy Rhimes. But thou must needs fall foul on Men of Sense, With Dulness equal to thy Impudence. Are D??n, C?dr??n, G??th, V??k, B?le, Those Names of Wonder, that adorn our Isle, Fit Subjects for thy vile pedantick Pen? Hence sawcy Usher, to thy Desk again. Construe Dutch Notes, and pore upon Boys A?es, But, prithee write no more heroick Farces. Teach blooming Blockheads by thy own try'd Rules, To give us Demonstration that they're Fools. Let 'em by N?'s Sermon-Stile refine Their English Prose, their Poetry by thine. Let W?sl??y's Rhimes their Emulation raise, And Ar??wk??r, instruct 'em how to praise. That, when all Ages in this Truth agree, They're finish'd Dunces, they may rival thee; Thou only Strain to mighty William's Sword! Old Jemmy never knighted such a T?d. For the most nauseous Mixture God can make, Is a dull Pedant, and a busie Quack. To Sir R???? Bl????re, on the two Arthurs being condemn'd to be hang'd. Once more take Pen in Hand, obsequious Knight, For here's a Theme thou can'st not underwrite, Unless the Devil owes thy Muse a Spite. To Prince and King thy Dullness Life did give; Let then these Arthurs too in Dogg'rel live. A Tale. By Col. Codrington. Poems and Prose of diff'rent Force lay Claim, With the same Confidence to Tully's Name; And shallow Criticks were content to say, Prose was his Bus'ness, Poetry his Play. Thus Cæsar thought, thus Brutus and the rest. Who knew the Man, and knew his Talent best. Maurus arose, sworn Foe to Health and Wit, Who Folio Bills and Folio Ballads writ; Who bustl'd much for Bread, and for Renown, By Lies and Poison scatter'd through the Town. To Roman Wives with Veneration known, For Roman Wives were very like our own. And Husbands then we find in Latin Song, Would love too little, and would live too long. Tully, says he, 'tis plain to Friends and Foes, Writes his own Verse, but borrows all his Prose, He fearless was, because he was not brave; A noble Roman would not beat a Slave. The Counsel smiling, said, Judicious Friend, Thy shining Genious shall thy Works defend, Inimitable Strokes defend thy Fame; Thy Beauties and thy Force are still the same: And I must yield, with the consenting Town, Thy Ballads and thy Bills are all thy own. Upon the Character of Codron, as 'tis drawn by the bungling Knight, in his Satyr against Wit. By Col. Codrington. How kind is Malice manag'd by a Sot, Where no Design directs the Embryo Thought, And Praise and Satyr stumble out by Lot. The mortal Thrust to Codron's Heart design'd, Proves a soft wanton Touch to charm his Mind. Can M???nt???gue or D??rs???t higher soar? Or can immortal Sh???ff???ld wish for more? Brightness, Force, Justness, Delicacy, Ease, Must form that Wit, that can the Ladies please. No false affected Rules debauch their Taste, No fruitless Toils their gen'rous Spirits waste, Which wear a Wit into a Dunce at last. No lumber Learning gives an awkward Pride, False Maxims cramp not, nor false Lights misguide. Voiture and W???lsh their easie Hours employ, Voiture and W???lsh, oft read will never cloy. With Care they guard the Musick of their Stile, They fly from B???ly, and converse with B???le: They steal no Terms, no Notions from the Schools, The Pedant's Pleasure, and the Pride of Fools; With native Charms their matchless Thoughts surprize, Soft as their Souls, and beauteous as their Eyes: Gay as the Light, and unconfin'd as Air, Chast and sublime, all worthy of the Fair. How then can a rough artless Indian Wit The faultless Palates of the Ladies fit? Codron will never stand so nice a Test, Nor is't with Praise, fair Mouths oblige him best. Let others make a vain Parade of Parts, Whilst Codron aims not at Applause, but Hearts. Secure him those, and thou shalt name the rest, Thy Spite shall chuse the worst, thy Taste the best. He will his Health to Mirmil's Care resign, He will with Buxtorf and with B?ly shine, And be a Wit in any Way but thine, An Epigram on Job, travested by the City Bard. By Col. Codrington. Poor Job lost all the Comforts of his Life, And hardly sav'd a Potsherd, and a Wife: Yet Job blest God, and Job again was blest, His Virtue was essay'd, and bore the Test. But had Heav'ns Wrath pour'd out its fiercest Vial, Had he been then burlesqu'd, without Denial, The patient Man had yielded to that Tryal. His pious Spouse, with Bl?re on her Side, Must have prevail'd, and Job had curs'd, and dy'd. To the Adventurous Knight of Cheapside, upon his Satyr against Wit. By Mr. Manning. What Frenzy has possess'd thy desp'rate Brain, To rail at Wit in this unhallow'd Strain? Reproach of thy own kind! to slander Sense, The nobl'st Gift bestow'd by Providence! Was it Revenge provok'd thee thus to write, Because thou'rt curs'd to such a dearth of Wit? Or was it eager Passion for a Name, To be inroll'd among the Fools of Fame? Like him, who rather than he'd live obscure, Would fire a Church to make his Name secure? Or was it thy Despair at length to find Thy loads of Chaff the Sport of ev'ry Wind? To see thy hasty Muse, that loves to roam, Promise such Journeys, but come founder'd Home? Just fate of Sots, who think in their vain Breast, Their Coffee-Rhimes shall stand the publick Test: Seiz'd with prolifick Dulness, 'tis thy Curse To write still on, and still too for the worse. Who hates not Wes???y, may thy Works esteem, Both alike able to disgrace their Theme. But thou, through wild Conceit, aspiring still, Claim'st, in thy ravings, Esculapian-skill. Quack, thou art sure in both, and curs'd is he, Who guided by his adverse Stars to thee, Employs thy deadly Potions to reclaim His feeble Health, thy Pen to spread his Fame. To the canting Author of the Satyr against Wit. By ? Mildmay, Esq; The Preacher Maurus cries, All Wit is vain, Unless 'tis like his Godliness, for Gain. Of most vain Things he may the Folly own; But Wit's a Vanity he has not known. Friendly Advice to Dr. Bl? By the Right Honourable the Lord ? Knighthood to Heroes only once was due, Now's the Reward of stupid praise in you. Why should a Quack be dubb'd, unless it be That Pois'ning is an Act of Chivalry? Thus we must own, you have your Thousands slain With direful strokes of your resistless Pen. By whipping the Boys, your Cruelty began, And grew, by bolder Steps, to killing Man. Just the reverse of Dionysius Fate, Who fell to flogging Bums, from murdering the State. For both these Trades your Genius far unfit, At length with sawcy Pride aspires to Wit. Which by pretending to, you more disgrace, Than toasting Beaus, our ancient British Race. I'th' Mountebank the Ass had lain conceal'd, But his loud braying has the Brute reveal'd. Such vile Heroicks, such unhallow'd Strains, Were never spawn'd before from Irish Brains; Nor drowsy Mum, nor dozing Usquebaugh, Could e'er suggest such Lines to Sir John Daw, You weakly skirmish with the Sins o'th' Age, And are the errant Scavenger o'th' Stage. Why Vertue makes no progress now is plain, Because such Knights as you its Cause maintain. If you'd a Friend to Sense and Virtue be, And to Mankind, for once be rul'd by me, Leave Moralizing, Drugs and Poetry. To Dr. Garth, on the fourth Edition of his Incomparable Poem, The Dispensary; occasion'd by some Lines in the Satyr against Wit. By Dr. James Drake. Bold thy Attempts, in these hard Times, to raise In our unfriendly Clime, the tender Bays, While Northern Blasts drive from the neighb'ring Flood, And nip the springing Lawrel in the Bud. On such bleak Paths our present Poets tread, The very Garland withers on each Head. In vain the Criticks strive to purge the Soil, Fertile in Weeds, it mocks their busie Toil. Spontaneous Crops of Jobs and Arthurs rise, Whose tow'ring Nonsense braves the very Skies. Like Paper-kites, the empty Volumes fly, And by mere force of Wind are rais'd on high. While we did these with stupid Patience spare, And from Apollo's Plants withdrew our Care, The Muses Garden did small Product yield, But Hemp and Hemlock over-ran the Field; 'Till skilful Garth, with salutary Hand, Taught us to weed, and cure poetick Land; Grubb'd up the Brakes and Thistles which he found, And sow'd with Verse and Wit the sacred Ground. But now the Riches of that Soil appear, Which four fair Harvests yields in half a Year. No more let Criticks of the want complain Of Mantuan Verse, or the Mæonian Strain; Above them Garth does on their Shoulders rise, And, what our Language wants, his Wit supplies, Fam'd Poets after him shall strain their Throats, And unfledg'd Muses chirp their infant Notes. Yes, Garth, thy Enemies confess thy Store, They burst with Envy, yet they long for more: Ev'n we, thy Friends, in doubt thy Kindness call, To see thy Stock so large, and Gift so small. But Jewels in small Cabinets are laid, And richest Wines in litle Casks convey'd. Let lumpish Bl?re his dull Hackney freight, And break his Back with heavy Folio's Weight; His Pegasus is of the Flanders Breed, And limb'd for Draught or Burthen, not for Speed. With Cart horse trot, he sweats beneath the Pack Of rhiming Prose and Knighthood on his Back. Made for a Drudge, e'en let him beat the Road, And tug of senseless Reams th'Heroick load; 'Till o'er-strain'd, the Jade is set, and tires, And sinking in the Mud, with Groans expires. Then Bl?re shall this Favour owe to thee, That thou perpetuat'st his Memory. Bavius and Mævius so their Works survive, And in one single Line of Virgil's live. To a Famous Doctor and Poet at Sadlers-hall. If Wit (as we are told) be a Disease, And if Physicians cure by Contraries; Bl?re alone the healing Secret knows, 'Tis from his Pen the grand Elixir flows. To the Cheapside Quack; occasion'd by this Verse in the Satyr against Wit. ‘Who with more ease can cure, than C??ch kill. By a Gentleman whom Dr. C???lb???ch had cur'd of the Gout. How durst thy railing Muse, vain Wretch, pretend In base Lampoons thus to abuse my Friend! Whose sacred Art has freed me from my Pains, And broke a haughty Tyrant's stubborn Chains? Keep off, for if thou com'st within my Clutches, I'll baste thy Knighthood with my quondam Crutches, The gen'rous Wine that does my Sorrows drown, The charming Cælia that my Nights does crown, The manly pleasures of the sporting Fields, The gay delights the pompous Drama yields; All this, and more, to his great Skill I owe, Such Blessings can thy boasted Helps bestow? The Snuff of Life, perhaps thy feeble Art May fondly lengthen to thy Patients smart; But Health no more 'tis in thy Pow'r to give, Than thy dull Muse can make her Heroes live. Ev'n War and Plague of killing to arraign In thee, is most nonsensical and vain: Thee, who a branded Killer art declar'd In both Capacities of Quack and Bard. Whatever Sots to thy Prescriptions fly, For their vain Confidence, are sure to die; And whate'er Argument thy Muse employs, Her awkward, stupid Management destroys. Death with sure Steps thy Doses still attends, And Death too follows, whom thy Muse commends, What can escape thy all-destroying Quill When ev'n thy Cordials, and thy Praises kill? Thy Mother, sure, when in Despair and Pain She brought thee forth, thought of the Murd'rer Cain. To that most incomparable Bard and Quack, the Author of the Satyr against Wit. By Tho. Cheek, Esq; I charge thee, Knight, in Great Apollo's Name, If thou'rt not dead to all Reproof and Shame, Either thy Rhimes or Clysters to disclaim. Both are too much, one feeble Brain to rack, Besides, the Bard will soon undo the Quack. Such Shoals of Readers thy damn'd Fustian kills, Thou'lt scarce leave one alive to take thy Pills. A merry Ballad on the City Bard. By the Honourable Richard Norton, Esq; To a new Play-house Tune, In London City, near Cheap-side, A wond'rous Bard does dwell Whose Epicks (if they're not bely'd) Do Virgil's far excel. A sprightly Wit and Person join'd Both Poet and Physician; Artist as famous in his Kind, For ought I know, as Titian. In Coffee-houses purest Air, His soggy Lines he writes, In Fields of Dust and Spittle there This British' Hero fights. By sudden Motion then o'erta'en, The Privy-house he chuses; Great are his Thoughts, and great his Pain, And yet no Time he loses. Grip'd in his Guts and Muse, he there indites, And praises Arthur most, when most he sh? On the Treatment of the Modern Drama. By Mr. Kn??? of Magd. Coll. Once Bear and Champion did engage In mortal fray on Roman Stage: Our Moderns have reviv'd the matter, The former Age renew'd in latter, And made Bear-garden of Theatre. Here Beau, the only Modish Brute, With honest Authors does dispute: And as on Roman Stage predicted, Fell Wound on Champion was inflicted, When stout Bruino kept his Station, Invoking Brother Constellation To assist him in the Disputation: To curry poor Heroic Hide well, And harrow Carcass, Back and Side well; But tho' he got a bloody Rump on't, His Honour still came off Triumphant. So tho' the Pit Grimalkins, that maul With wicked Serenade of Catcall, Oft rout a poor Dramatic Hero, (As Teague was once by lero, lero.) A well-writ Play, like Russians treat, Confound the Scene, and Blot defeat, In spite of all the Dammee Chorus, Th'immortal Wit is still victorious. I then in person of an Author, Since good Dramatics have no growth here, Like pious Felons doom'd to be Made Pendulum for Gallow-tree; That gives advice, lest sinful Mortal, Like him his days in Hemp should curtail, Advise you all to leave off Writing, The mortal Sin of well enditing, But if no Counsel can be used By riming Wretch when once be-mused, (For Crown and Bum there's such a curse in, They're ne'er at ease, but when untrussing) Since wholsom Salt of Author season'd, To taste of Nation is unpleasant, (When busie Noddle's next in labour, And has a need to purge on Paper) Invoke the bastard Race of Phæbus, Skill'd in Acrostic, Pun, and Rebus, With spirit of late Marriage-hater, T'assist to make Lampoon on Nature, And ev'n on Farce it self a Satyr; For that alone gives titillation, And saves poor Poet from damnation. On Dr. Lower, who was observed to be grown good-natur'd a little before his Death. By another hand. Had not good humour o'er the ill prevail'd, Death in attempting Dr. Lower had fail'd; For he, alas, good Man, in Health declin'd, By changing the bad Manners of his Mind: And's very Understanding got a Cough, By leaving an old Habit too soon off. For had he kept his Humour most austere, He might have yet liv'd with us many a Year, Preserv'd in his own Pickle, Vinegar: But when the Alkali had kill'd the sow'r, His Blood being sweeten'd, off troopt Dr. Lower. To his Cruel Mistress. Out of French. I 'Tis then decreed, and now I find I'm for a Sacrifice design'd; Since my imperious Fair denies Rest to my Soul, and slumber to my Eyes. II Go take a Kiss, Love whispers in my Ear; But love, alas! gives way to fear. Awful Respect the aspiring Flame commands. Tyes up my Tongue, and binds my Hands. III Ah! must your bleeding Lover die, And see his balm, and see his cure so nigh? Or fierce, and eager of the Bliss, Shall he presume to seize a balmy Kiss. IV No—he'll ten thousand Deaths endure, And all the rigours of his Fate attend, E're he'll by Sacriledge attempt his Cure, And his dear Bellamette offend. An Ode upon a Kiss. Out of French. I Nay, now ambitious Thoughts farewel, I pity Kings in all their state, While thus in Lesbia's Arms I dwell, And mighty Love does on my Triumphs wait. II Thus let me languishing expire, Incircled in her snowy Arms, Till she revives me with her Charms, And pours into my Breast a nobler Fire. III Thus let me sigh my Soul away, And Revel in immortal Bliss, Thus let me spend th'auspicious Day, And crown each smiling Moment with a Kiss. IV Adonis ne'er was half so blest, Nor half the pleasure shar'd, as I: Tho' Love's bright Goddess him carest, And in her Arms hugg'd the delicious Boy. V Nor Jove himself such transports knew, When Danae's charms the captive God did hold, Tho' he, the pleasure to pursue, Mortgag'd his poor Almightyship to Gold. VI A thousand Loves in solemn state On those two rosie Lips reside, While busie I, with eager pride, Sip all their Sweets, and bless my happy Fate. VII Now on her glowing Breasts I range, Now kiss her Cheeks, and now her Eyes; The Pleasure's heighten'd by the change, And fills me with unruly Joys. VIII But ah! my Beauteous Nymph beware How you encrease my store, For else your pamper'd Slave may dare, Drunk as he is with Joy, to press for something more, IX For say, fond Lovers, what you will To deifie a Kiss, 'Tis but a Pledge, or Prologue still, To the succeeding Acts of Bliss. A Translation. Principio, Cœlum, &amp; Terras, Titaniaq; astra Spiritus intus alit, totumq; infusa per artus Mens agitat molem— I'll sing how God, the World's almighty Mind, Thro' all infus'd, and to that All confin'd; Directs the Parts, and with an equal Hand Supports the whole, enjoying his command: How all agree, and how the parts have made Strict Leagues, subsisting by each others aid. How all by Reason move, because one Soul Lives in the parts, diffusing thro' the whole. For did not all the friendly parts conspire To make one whole, and keep the Frame entire; And did not Reason guide, and Sense controul The vast stupendious Machine of the whole; Earth wou'd not keep its place, the Skies wou'd fall, And universal stiffness deaden all. Stars wou'd not whirl their round, nor Day nor Night Their course perform, but stop their usual Flight. Rains wou'd not feed the Fields, and Earth deny Mists to the Clouds, and Vapours to the Sky. Seas wou'd not fill the Springs, nor Springs return Their grateful Tribute from their flowing Urn. Nor wou'd the All, unless contriv'd by Art, So justly be proportion'd in each part; That neither Seas, nor Skies, nor Stars exceed Our Wants, nor are too scanty for our need. Thus stands the Frame, and the Almighty Soul, Thro' all diffus'd, so turns, and guides the whole, That nothing from its settled station swerves, And Motion alters not the Frame, but still preserves. This God, or Reason, which the Orbs does move, Makes Things below depend on Signs above: Tho' far remov'd, tho' hid in Shades of Night, And scarce to be descry'd by their own Light. Yet Nations own, and Men their influence feel, They rule the publick, and the private will; The Proofs are plain. Thus from a different Star We find a fruitful, or a barren Year; Now Grains increase, and now refuse to grow, Now quickly ripen, now their Growth is slow. The Moon commands the Seas; she drives the Main To pass the Shores, then drives it back again. And this Sedition chiefly swells the streams, When opposite she views her Brother's Beams: Or when she near in close Conjunction rides, She rears the Floods, and swells the flowing Tides; Or when attending on the yearly Race, The Equinoctial sees her borrow'd Face. Her Power sinks deep, it searches all the Main, Testaceous fish, as she her Light regains, Increase, and still diminish in her Wane. For as the Moon in deepest darkness mourns, Then Rays receive, and points her borrow'd Horns, Then turns her Face, and with a Smile invites The full Effusions of her Brother's Lights, They to her Changes due Proportions keep, And show her various Phases in the Deep. So Brutes, whom Nature did in sport create, Ignorant of themselves, and of their Fate, A secret Instinct still erects their Eyes To Parent Heav'n, and seems to make them wise. One at the New Moon's rise to distant Shores Retires, his Body sprinkles, and adores. Some see Storms gathering, or Serenes foretel, And scarce our Reason guides us half so well. Then who can doubt that Man, the glorious Pride Of all, is nearer to the Stars ally'd? Nature in Man's capacious Soul has wrought, And given them Voice expressive of their Thought In Man the God descends, and joys to find The narrow Image of his greater Mind. But why should all the other Arts be shown? Too various for Productions of our own. Why shou'd I sing how different Tempers fall, And inequality is seen in all? How many strive with equal Care to gain The highest prize, and yet how few obtain? Which proves not Mattar sways, but Wisdom rules And measures out the bigness of our Souls. Sure Fate stands fixt, nor can its Laws decay, 'Tis Heavn's to rule and Matter's Essence to obey. Who cou'd know Heaven, unless that Heav'n bestow'd The Knowledge? or find God, but part of God? How cou'd the Space Immence be e'er confin'd Within the Compass of a narrow mind? How cou'd the Skies, the Dances of the Stars, Their Motions adverse, and eternal Wars. Unless kind Nature in our Breasts had wrought Proportion'd Souls, be subject to our Thought? Were Heaven not aiding to advance our Mind, To know Fate's Laws, and teach the Way to find; Did not the Skies their kindred Souls Improve, Direct, and lead them thro' the Maze above, Discover Nature, shew its secret Springs, And tell the sacred intercourse of Things. How impious were our Search, how bold our Course, Thus to assault, and take the Skies by Force. A most convincing Reason's drawn from Sense, That this vast Frame is mov'd by Providence, Which like the Soul does every whirl advance, It must be God, nor was it made by chance, As Epicurus dreamt: He madly thought This beauteous Frame of heedless Atoms wrought. The Seas and Earth, the Stars and spacious Air, Which forms new Worlds, or does the old repair, First rose from these, and still supply'd remain, And all must be when Chance shall break the Chain Dissolv'd to these wild Principles again. Absurd and Nonsense! Atheist use thine Eyes, And having view'd the order of the Skies, Think, if thou canst, that Matter blindly hurl'd, Without a Guide, shou'd frame this wound'rous World. But did Chance make, and Chance still rule the whole, Why do the Signs in constant order rowl? Observe set times to shut and open Day? Nor meet, nor justle, and mistake their way? Perform their Course, as if by Laws confin'd, None hasten on, and leave the rest behind. Why every day does the discovering Flame Show the same World, and leave it still the same? And ev'en at Night, when Time in secret flies, And veils himself in Shades from human Eyes, Can by the Signs Men know how fast he fled, And in the Skies the hasty Minutes read? Why shou'd I count how oft the Earth has mourn'd The Sun's retreat, and smil'd when he return'd? How oft he does his various course divide 'Twixt Winter's Nakedness, and Summer's Pride? All mortal Things must change. The fruitful Plain, As Seasons turn, scarce knows her self again; Such various Forms she bears: Large Empires too Put off the former Face, and take a new: Yet safe the World, and free from change does last, No Years encrease it, and no Years can waste. Its course it urges on, and keeps its Frame, And still will be, because 'twas still the same. It stands secure from time's devouring Rage, For 'tis a God that guides, nor can it change with Age. On the Death of Dr. Kirleus. Ye Ghosts of Trigg, old Saffold, and Ponteus, Arise! Arise! to meet the Great KIRLEUS: And ye kind Damsels of this sinful Town, Us'd to dispense Love's Joys for Half a Crown, Lament, for now your Trusty Friend is gone. Ye Holborn Bullies strow his Herse with Roses, For to his Heav'nly Skill you owe your Noses, Weep, Cupid weep, nor thy just Sorrow smother, For, Child thou'dst better far have lost thy Mother. With Rev'rend Kirle Love's Power will fall away, His Empire lessen, and his Strength decay. Thy Pills, Old Bard, in spite of State and Kirk, Ev'n on the Sabbath-day it self wou'd Work: And Sinners brought, (so Righteous was thy Sentence) To Pensive Stool of Sorrowful Repentance. Since Death on thee has laid her Fingers Icy, Ipse te Pinus, ipse flevere Myricæ. And Sympathetick Fits in mournal state, With Tears of Turpentine bewail'd thy Fate. Thou never did'st reject poor daggled Miss, Altho' she Sued in forma Pauperis. Grave Shop-keepers were set up by thy Aid, And many a Sound Divine by thee was made. In Term, and out of Term, Kirle serv'd the Nation, And knew no Intervals of dull Vacation. Say what you will, this matter of true Fact is, That few exceeded him in Chamber-practise. Lawyers in Crowds to his fam'd Mansion prest, In hopes to have their Cause by him redrest: For none knew better how to make an end on't, 'Twixt Plantiff Counseller, and Clap Defendant. Tho' the Disease prov'd ne'er so stiff and cross, He soon cou'd check it with a Noli Pross. Young Clerks, when stray'd from Noverint Universi, By him were Cur'd; and was not that a Mercy? He was Loves Shre've, and prove Infection, Chas'd Ulcers by a Potion of Ejection, And as for th'oldest Ills, knew how to scare 'em, By marching with a Posse Pillularum. Methinks I still behold Majestick Kirle, With Solemn Air his Belgick Whiskers twirle, Wrapt in Blue Rug methinks I hear him Talk, And prole for Customers in Grays-Inn-Walk. But why fond hopes shou'd I thus feed in vain? He's gone, alas! and ne'er will come again. Since then he has left us for a better place, Remember, Gentlemen, your Friend John Case. An Epitaph on Dr. Kirleus of Grays-Inn-Lane, occasion'd by his Friends reporting him only gone into the Country. The famous Kirleus, Collegiate Physician, As cheap a Practitioner as you cou'd wish one, Who only with Diet-Drink, and a few Pills, Cur'd Gout, Stone, and Pox, and a Thousand more Ills; Is gone to the Country Infernal with Physick, To cure Rhadamanthus, they say of the Tissick. Let not Nendick then brag, Of his Tetrachymag, Nor himself Tillburg prize on, Drinking Bumpers of Poyson. So useful a Doctor our Youngsters will miss, He hinder'd no Business, till Death hinder'd his. A Journey thus tedious all Sporters may mourn, For 'tis Forty to One that he'll never return. The Fable of the Satyr, and the Traveller. I To his poor Cell, a Satyr led A Traveller, with Cold half dead, And with great Kindness treated: A Fire Nose-high he made him strait, Show'd him his Elbow-Chair of State And near the Chimney seated. II His tingling Hands the Stranger blows, At which the Satyr wond'ring rose, And bluntly ask'd the Reason. Sir, quoth the Man, I mean no harm, I only do't my Hands to Warm, In this cold Frosty Season. III The Satyr gave him from the Pot, A Mess of Porridge piping hot; The Man blow'd o'er his Gruel. What's that for, Friend? The Satyr cry'd, To Cool my Broth, his Guest reply'd, And Truth, Sir, is a Jewel. IV How, quoth the Host, then is it so, And can you Contradictions blow? Turn out, and leave my Cottage. This honest Mansion ne'er shall hold Such Rascals as blow Hot and Cold, The De'll must find you Pottage. The C?'s desir'd that in their next Choice, They'd be pleds'd from this Fable to take good Advice, For a Man that two Churches at once has in view, Shams both in their Turns, and to neither is true. A Dialogue betwixt the New Lotteries, and the Royal-Oak. New Lotteries. To you, the Mother of our Schools, Where Knaves by License manage Fools, Finding fit Juncture and Occasion, To pick the Pockets of the Nation, We come to know how we must Treat 'em, And to their Hearts-content may Cheat 'em. Royal-Oak. It cheers my aged Heart to see, So Numerous a Progeny; I find by you, that 'tis Heaven's Will, That Knavery shou'd flourish still. You have Docility, and Wit, And Fools were never wanting yet. Observe the Crafty Auctioneer, His Art to sell Waste-Paper dear: When he for Salmon baits his Hooks, That Cormorant of Offal Books, Who bites, as sure as Maggots breed, Or Carrion-Crows on Horseflesh feed. Fair specious Titles him deceive, To sweep what Sl? and T?n leave. If greedy Gulls you wou'd ensnare, Make 'em Proposals wond'rous fair. Tell 'em strange Golden Show'rs shall fall, And promise Mountains to 'em all. New Lotteries. That Craft we've been already taught, And by that Trick have Millions caught. Books, Bawbles, Toys, all sorts of Stuff, Have gone off this way well enough. Nay Musick too invades our Art, And to some Tune wou'd play her Part. I'll shew you now, what we are doing, For we have divers Wheels a going. We have found out richer Lands, Than Asia's Hills, or Africk's Sands, And to vast Treasures must give Birth, Deep hid in Bowels of the Earth; In fertile Wales, and God knows where, Rich Mines of Gold and Silver are, From whence we drain prodigious store Of Silver Coin'd, tho' none in Ore, Which down our Throats rich Coxcombs pour, In hopes to make us Vomit more. Royal Oak. This Project surely must be good; Because not eas'ly understood: Besides it gives a mighty scope, To the Fool's Argument, Vain hope. No Eagle's Eye the Cheat can see, Thro' Hope thus back'd by Mystery. New Lotteries. We have besides a Thousand more, For Great and Small, for Rich and Poor, From him that can his Thousands spare, Down to the Penny-Customer. Royal-Oak. The silly Mob in Crowds will run, To be at easy Rates undone, A Gimcrack-Show draws in the Rout, Thousands their All by Pence lay out. New Lotteries. We by Experience, find it true; But we have Methods wholly New, Strange late invented Ways to Thrive, To make Men pay for what they Give, To get the Rents into our Hands Of their Hereditary Lands, And out of what doth thence arise, To make 'em buy Annuities. We've Mathematick Combination, To cheat Fools by plain Demonstration, Which shall be fairly manag'd too, The Undertakers knows not how. Beside,— Royal-Oak. Pray, hold a little, here's enough, To beggar Europe of this Stuff. Go on, and prosper, and be Great, I am to You a Puny-Cheat. An Impromptu to Shadwell's Memory by Dr. B? And must our glorious Laureat then depart, Heav'n if it please may take his loyal Heart, As for the rest sweet Devil fetch a Cart. Antenor's Speech in the Second Æneid, applied to the Declaration for Liberty of Conscience. In the Year 1687. Timeo Danaos, &amp; dona ferentes. You dull Dissenters, what vain foily blinds Your Senses thus, and captivates your Minds? Think you this proffer'd Liberty is free From Tricks, and Snares, and Papal Treachery? Think you 'twas meant according to the Letter? Oh that such plodding Heads shou'd know the Pope no better, Trust me, this Kindness either was design'd T'inflame our Quarrels, and our Weakness find: Or else the Breach was open'd at a venture, That at one Hole both Cowl and Cloak might enter. Pray Heav'n there be no farther Mischief meant, But I'm afraid there's Roman Opium in't. Be't what it will, the gilded Pill suspect, And with a smiling scorn your proffer'd Fate reject; A Papist, tho' ungiving, means you evil, But when he scatters Gifts and Mercies, he's the Devil. Prologue spoken before the University of Oxford, 1683. When Greece o'erwhelm'd in the wide Deluge lay, And all the Land was one continu'd Sea, The Muses Hill secure and lofty stood, Above the vain Attempts of the insulting Flood. There good Deucalion first saluted Land, Put in his Boat, and touch'd the happy Strand. So when wild Faction all our Land alarm'd, Our Land by the prevaling Jugglers charm'd. When pregnant with dire Seeds the Clouds did rise, Presaging civil Tempests in our Skies. Here Godlike Charles did a safe Harbour win, Here laugh'd at all the Threats of daring Sin, And shunn'd the popular Deluge as it came rowling in. With you no perjur'd Bog-trotters were found, With Meal-tub Plots and Armies under-ground, Rogues, that wou'd damn themselves for half a Crown. Rogues, that for one poor draught of middling Beer Wou'd hang a Parish, and for Tripe a Shire. 'Tis true, some few you had, but Traytors come Here to receive, not to deserve their doom. So Paradice the Serpent gain'd at first, Enter'd the blest Abodes, but strait he was accurst. This is your Happiness: But we are still alarm'd with senseless noise, Guildhall Elections, and leud frantick Cries. Tir'd with dull Managers of duller Plots, And free-born Slaves, and Magna-Charta Sots. Oh wou'd the Town a pattern take from you, Whom the worst times still found to Cæsar true. Discords wou'd cease, ill-natur'd Jars retire, And every Muse in Charles's praise conspire. Peace with her Train wou'd guard our Halcyon shore, And Britain envy Saturn's Age no more. Epilogue. Not with more Grief the Whiggish herd beheld Their Plots discover'd, their Intriegues reveal'd, And all their Godly Villanies run down; Than now we feel to leave your happy Town. Now must our Tribe, since we depart from you, Shake Hands with Learning, and bid Wit adieu: With doggrel Rimes the stupid rout appease, And murder English perfectly to please. So some to get an Alms a lameness feign, And by pretended halting pity gain. When to some Town our strowling Troops repair, Leave's to be granted by the worthy Mayor: He with his numerous Train first takes his Seat, Below his Scarlet Brethren fill the Pit. Then ev'n our Women must less gay appear, Leave Painting off, lest they should seem more fair Than the pale Daughter of the Reverend Mayor. If we in acting, as our part requires, Swear by the Gods, and all the heavenly Fires, The Sot pricks up a wondrous pair of Ears, My Zeal no longer such profaneness bears, Twelvepence for every Oath your Hero swears. Wit here, triumphant, bears an ample sway, And the bright Metal shines without allay; Nothing is here condemn'd for being good, Nor talk we Nonsense to be understood. But tho' your Learning the whole Isle inspires, Your Townsmen warm not by the neighbring Fires, Born in the happy place, where Wit does rule, They keep their natural Right of being dull. So the rude Nations, where with greatest light The reveal'd Truth was first expos'd to sight, By no Rewards, no Miracles reclaim'd, Wou'd ev'n in spight of Providence be damn'd, Howe'er our Courtiers do their Fate dispose, Dullness the Charter is they'll never lose. A Catch. By Mr. T. Brown. I Let the Woman be damn'd, (a mod'rate Fate) Or die an old Maid, as grey as a Cat, That her Lover refuses for want of Estate. II Let her, that sets Man, like a Beast, to be sold, And above metal'd Flesh, loves a Lump of dead Gold, Look green when she's young, and be pox'd when she's old. III But let those that are wise, contemn the dull Store; Wives chose by their Weight, will be weighty no more; If for Gold they will wed, for the same they will whore. A Panegyrick upon Col. George Walker. After the Manner of the Irish. Our Gracious King gave him five thousand Pound; And out of the Rebels Lands, when they are found, He promises him a thousand Pound by th'Year, Which in a short time will unquestionably appear. Likewise he promises him the Dean'ry of Londonderry, When that the Dean of Londonderry will die; But if the Dean of Londonderry will not die, He promises him the Bishoprick of Londonderry. More of his valiant Deeds and Worth, what need we then to cry-ah, Since Walker George has made amends for Walker Obadiah? To Mr. D'Urfey, upon his incomparable Ballads, call'd by him Lyrick Odes. I Thou Cur, half French, half English Breed; Thou Mungrel of Parnassus, To think tall Lines, run up to Seed, Should ever tamely pass us. II Thou write Pindaricks, and be damn'd! Write Epigrams for Cutlers; None with thy Lyricks can be sham'd, But Chamber-maids and Butlers. III In t'other World expect dry Blows; No Tears can wash thy Stains out; Horace will pluck thee by the Nose, And Pindar beat thy Brains out. On Flowers in a Lady's Bosom. Behold the promis'd Land, where Pleasure flows! See how the Milk-white Hills do gently rise, And beat the silken Skies! Behold the Valley spread with Flow'rs below! Other Discoveries, Fate, let me not share; If I find out, may I inhabit there. The happy Flow'rs, how they allure my Sense! The fairer Soil gives 'em the noble Hew; Her Breath perfumes 'em too: Rooted i'th' Heart, they seem to spring from thence. Tell, tell me why, thou fruitful Virgin-Breast, Why should so good a Soil lie unpossest? Surely some Champion in the Cause of Love, Has languish'd here—more weary with the Sight, Than vanquish'd quite; While the soft God took Pity from above, And thinking to reward his Service well, Bid him grow there where he so nobly fell. So when the longing Cytherea found The murder'd Boy, who long deceiv'd her Eyes Under a Flow'r Disguise, And pluck'd the curious Posey from the Ground: Fair Cytherea's Bosom look'd like this; So blush'd Adonis in the Seat of Bliss. The London Vintners Answer to Mr. Brown. If what thou asserts, dear Thomas, be true, It is to get rid of such Chap-men as you, That I and my Brethren have learned to brew. Whatever Ingredients we put in the Vat, Whether Dogs-turd or Honey, no Matter for that; For all our Design's but to poison a Rat. He that dies by bad Wine, and not by the Halter, Departs without Chime of Hopkins's Psalter, And that you well know is no matter of Laughter. To Mr. Henry Purcel. Long did dark Ignorance our Isle o'er spread, Our Musick, and our Poetry lay dead. But the dull Malice of a barbarous Age, Fell most severe on David's sacred Page. To wound his Sense, and quench his heav'n-born Fire, Three vile Translators lewdly did conspire, In holy Doggerel, and low chiming Prose, The King and Poet they at once depose. Vainly he did th'unrighteous change bemoan, And languish'd in vile Numbers, not his own. Nor stop his Usage here: For what escap'd in Wisdom's ancient Rhimes, Was murdred o'er and o'er in the Composers Chimes. What praises, Purcell, to thy skill are due, Who hast to Judah's Monarch been so true. By thee he moves our Hearts, by thee he reigns, By thee shakes off his old inglorious Chains, And sees new Honours done to his immortal Strains. Not Italy, the Mother of each Art, Did e'er a juster happier Son impart. In thy performance we with wonder find Corelli's Genius to Bassani joyn'd. Sweetness combin'd with Majesty prepares To wing Devotion with inspiring Airs. Thus I unknown my gratitude express, And conscious gratitude cou'd do no less; This Tribute from each British Muse is due, The whole Poetick Tribe's oblig'd to you. For where the Author's scanty Words have fail'd, Thy happier Graces, Purcell, have prevail'd. And surely none but you, with equal ease, Cou'd add to David, and make Durfy please. On Dr. Sherlock. The same Allegiance to two Kings he pays Swears the same Faith to both, and both betrays. No wonder if to swear he's always free, That hath two Gods to swear by more than we. Upon the taking of the new Oaths. Our Fathers took Oaths as of old they took Wives, To have and to hold for the Terms of their Lives; But we take our Oaths, as our Whores, for our Ease, And a Whore and a Rogue may part when they please. Tom Brown having committed some great Fault at the University, the Dean of Christ Church threaten'd to expel him; but Tom, with a very submissive Epistle, begging Pardon, so pleas'd the Dean, that he was minded to forgive him, upon this Condition, viz. That he should translate this Epigram out of Marshal extempore. I do not love you Dr. Fell, But why I cannot tell; But this I know full well, I do not love you Dr. Fell. [When Eve the Fruit had tasted] When Eve the Fruit had tasted, She to her Husband hasted, And chuck'd him on the Chin-a; Dear Bud, (quoth she) come taste this Fruit, 'Twill finely with your Palate suit, To eat it is no Sin-a. [As moody Job, in shirtless Case] As moody Job, in shirtless Case, With Colly-flowers all o'er his Face, Did on the Dunghill languish, His Spouse thus whispers in his Ear; Swear Husband, as you love me, swear; 'Twill ease you of your Anguish. A Supplement to Tho. Brown's Works. Jo. Haines in Pennance: Or, his Recantation Prologue, at his acting of Poet Bayes in the Duke of Buckingham's Play, call'd The Rehearsal. Spoken in a white Sheet, with a burning Taper in his Hand, upon his Admittance into the House, after his Return from the Church of Rome. Written by T. Brown, for his Friend Jo. Haines, As you dislike the Converts of the Nation, That went to Rome, and left your Congregation, By the same Rule pray kindly entertain Your penitent lost Sheep return'd again. For reconverted Haines, taught by the Age, Is now come back to his Primitive Church, the Stage; And own my Crime, of leaving in the lurch My Mother Playhouse, she's my Mother Church. As Penitents do go from you to Rome, A Penitent from Rome to you I come. Tho' I from you to Rome did never go As Runagade for her, but Spy for you. For see'ng the Beaux and Banterers every Day Ev'n tired with themselves in ev'ry Play, I went to Rome, to seek for Fops more new, And more ridiculous than any of you; A Miracle from Rome, I thought, might do. Besides I left ye, all design'd for Rome; But see'ng ye came not over, I came home: For I, like you, finding my self mistaken, Did early tack about, to save my Bacon. Pox on't!— At Rome a Godly Part they made me play; A damn'd unnatural one to me, you'll say: They wou'd not let me roar, or rant or swear, But fob'd me off with Penitence and Prayer, Guess how that Penance relisht with a Player. That ever any Player should have the Face Thus to pretend to such a thing as Grace! 'Tis very hard indeed, th'Italian Nation Should put this Phiz a little out of fashion; But yielding Nature, and this tempting Face Confirms me Flesh and Blood in spite of Grace: Therefore, dear loving Sisters of the Pit, Again your Brother Runagade admit, And don't despise me now because I've liv'd Where sawcy Boys claim your Prerogative. No, Sisters; no,— I ne'er turn'd Heretick, in Love at least; Twas decent Whoring kept my Thoughts still chaste: But you, kind Sirs! who here are daily known, To love all Whores but her of Babylon, Will never damn Jo. Haines for his Religion. Well Sirs!— B'ing thus confest, and free from all Pollution, I beg from your kind Hands my Absolution. Tho. Brown's Recantation of his Satyr on the French King. Suppos'd by some to be by Mr. Brown, tho' said by others to be Written by a Nonjurant-Parson. Facit Recantatio Versum. And has this Bitch my Muse trapan'd me? Then I'm as much undone as can be; I knew the Jilt would never leave me Till to a Prison she'd deceiv'd me: Curst be the Wretch, and sure he's curst That taught the Trade of Rhyming first: 'Tis a damn'd Trade, and who pursues it, I'll pass my word, at last he rues it: Homer and Virgil were but Tools, Fit, only for the use of Fools. And Horace too, with all his Art, To Men of Sense not worth a Fart; Even Causabon for Satyr Famous Was but a jingling Ignoramus. And all the rest to Ben and so forth A Crew of useless Things of no worth: But now I have no time to rail, The Hog hath got another Tail; My Wits are rather on the Wrack To save my own Poetick Back: Yet by the way, 'tis very hard, Poets of all Men should be barr'd From labouring in their proper Station; Why, where's the Justice of the Nation? Believe me, Sirs, as I'm a Sinner, I writ that Satyr for a Dinner: And Stampt it with a Parson's Name, Not as I meant them any Shame, But since I must the Matter tell, I thought 'twould make the Paper sell; By all that's good, and all that true is, I ever lov'd and honour'd Lewis: He's Great and Wise, more could I say, But fear again to disobey, And for his Priests, I here protest, I value them like all the rest: And tho' I curst them all, what then? The Men are honest harmless Men. Next for King James and Prince of Wales, I always wish'd them happy Gales, And for my sawcy naming Molly, I own 'twas Impudence and Folly. Lastly, for naming the Non-Juror, Why that was but Poetick furor, I know I have ungrateful been, 'Twas raging Hunger drew me in T'abuse those very Friends that have Almost preserv'd me from the Grave; They're honest Men, mark what I say, If I love any Priests, 'tis they. I now confess 'tis highly base, T'insult the Gown in such a Case: And could the Thing be done again, I'd starve before I'd wrong such Men. What shall I say, I here recant, And own my self a Sycophant: But oh! I fear that will not do, A Thousand dismal Thoughts pursue. I'm all in pain, and let me tell ye, My Back begins to curse my Belly; I'm just as if at Cart's-Arse ty'd, With Hangman grinning by my Side, And Mob of all sorts crowding round me, Advising Ketch to swindge me soundly; And what torments me worst of all, Methinks that some among them bawl, 'Tis he that for a Crown to spend, Reviles Crown'd Heads, betrays his Friend. All this, 'tis true, I well deserve, And yet 'tis very hard to starve; So that if Things were rightly stated, Part of my Sentence might be bated; I was of Poppins-Alley Chief, Till forc'd from thence to seek Relief; And to avoid some dang'rous Rogues Took Shelter among Pedagogues. 'Twas then, like the Sicilian King, Under strict Laws I Boys did bring; And tho' I was but a Viceroy, I could command the chiefest Boy: But here a little Time was spent, Before I left my Government, Was charg'd with Male-Administration, And so pull'd down from Regal Station. To Town again disgrac'd I came, For now 'tis time to hide my Shame; Where since I sharp'd, and spung'd and tick'd, Being always scorn'd, and sometimes kick'd, And yet the worst is still behind, Oh! hear me but, and you'll be kind. For three long Weeks my Muse and I Had been shut up in Garret high: The Cause I think I need not tell Poet with P? convertible; While thus I lay in desperate state In comes a Bawd whose Name was Kate; A Rampant Jade, where once I tabled, Who finding me of Strength disabled, Not Vows nor Promises could save me, But off she tears the Cloaths she gave me. And thus of Coat, e'en Shirt, bereft, Poor naked Tom in Bed was left. In this most sharp and strange Distress, 'Twas then I thought on trusty Bess; Who, tho' I knew she was but poor, I always found a faithful Whore: To her with Art I made Petition, And briefly told my sad Condition. But I forgot to tell you how With hot Ox-cheek, and Heel of Cow, With Trotters neat, and Tripe like Jelly, She oft had fill'd my empty Belly. And one thing more I had forgot Hot Furmety and Rice-Milk hot She never let me want; for why, It was her Trade the same to cry. I thought (poor Fool) she'd pity me, Who thus resolv'd to set me free. With Twenty-pence which she had got, And Shillings Four, for Loan of Pot, To some convenient Bulk she hies, And there a Coat and Breeehes buys; The want of Shirt too, to supply, Sends me her Smock, tho' hardly dry. And more, to fit me out compleat, For t'other Three pence buys a Cheat. When thus equipp'd, abroad I venture, Hoping on Subjects new to enter: But all my Hopes proves vain, God wot, Bess still must want her Porridge-Pot. My Belly too grows lank, for she Had no Rice-Milk, nor Furmety. All Friends I try'd, not one was willing To Credit me with one poor Shilling; In this Distress, without advising, I fell to cursed Satyrising. Oh! pity me, or I am lost, Far worse than when in Blanket tost; And if this time I'm spar'd from whipping, If e'er again you catch me tripping, May all the Plagues that e'er befel A Poet poor, on this side Hell, Seize me at once, and may I be A publick Mark of Infamy. May all my Whores and Duns o'ertake me, And all my Friends, even Bess, forsake me: And may the P?, with which I struggle, Join'd with the Gout, afflict me double: May I at last by Inches die, First lose a Nose, and then an Eye; And when I'm dead, then may I have A just Memento on my Grave. An ELEGY, Suppos'd to be written by Stephen Switch, upon Dobbin a Coach-Horse, who departed this Mortal Life on Saturday the 8th of April. Oh, cruel Death! whose Rage without Remorse is, Why should'st thou persecute poor harmless Horses? Whose righteous Blood, as said a Spokesman wise, Against thy Malice will in Judgment rise. On Courtiers thou'st my Leave to be severe, For now and then I grudge thee not a Peer; Spiritual or Temporal, no matter whether, Or a whole Corporation take together. Such Game methinks might thy keen Stomach stay, Considering thou'd'st a Whale the other Day, Then why the Plague must thou on Horse-flesh prey? It grieves my Conscience, and disturbs my Quiet, To see thee given to such Tartarian Diet Poor Two-leg'd Beasts thou think'st not worth a Groat, But into Porter's foolish Sport art got, And must be playing at All-Fours, God wot. Were I t'advise a Dinner for thy Palate, A well-cram'd Priest should serve instead of Sallad, Fat Draymen's Chines should be a standing Dish: I'd have an Admiral, when I din'd on Fish. If nought but tender Morsels wou'd go down, Commend me to a Lady of the Town; But for a choice tough Bit t'employ the Maw, I'd take a Scriv'ner, or a Man of Law. But thou'rt, I find, a Stranger to good Breeding, And dost not know the Methods of good Feeding: Oh! Dobbin, thou wert hurried off the Stage, Just in the prime and vigour of thy Age. Howe'er, dear Beast, 'tis to thy Friends some Ease, Thou fell'st by a Right Worshipful Disease. Instead of Clyster, Balls, and Farrier's Physick, Thy Days, alas! were shorten'd by the Ptisick. And all Men know (I speak it without scoffing) That many an Alderman has di'd of Coughing. But if Heav'ns Justice will endure Inspection, What had thy Lungs done to deserve Infection? For I can swear thou ne'er had'st the Ambition, To talk Profaneness, Bawdy, or Sedition. Once more farewel, my dear belov'd Quadruped, The loss of thee has plainly made me stupid. I knew thy Dad, thy Mother, and thy Grandsir, But thou return'st to my Complaints no Answer. No Hugmatee, nor Flip, my Grief can smother; I lov'd thee, Dobbin, better than my Brother. Since then so lame my Muse, so dull my Wit is, I'll have thy Epitaph compos'd by Pittis. To Mr. Justice Higden, upon the ill Success of his Play. No longer your expected Play conceal, But to a more impartial Court appeal. The righteous few, true to the Cause of Wit, Will soon reverse the Sentence of the Pit. Why should their Censure Men of Sense alarm? Those Sons of Muggleton can do no harm. The Wit, that oft their hasty Malice dooms, Outlives its Judges, nay, outlasts their Tombs. Thus 'twas my Fate to visit once a Friend, Whom dire foreboding Omens did attend: The Doctor tells him, Sir, your Hour is nigh, Send for the Parson, and prepare to die. In vain the help of Physic you implore, Art has been try'd, but Art can do no more. With this the angry Patient rais'd his Head, And Doctor, do you then conclude me dead? Peace, you grave Sot, elsewhere your Cant bestow, I'll bury half the College e'er I go. And spite of that learn'd Phiz, and reverend Beard, Will live to see your Rascalship interr'd. Thus he run on, and as his Stars decreed, Was soon from his unkind Distemper freed; Left his vain gaping Kindred in the lurch, And saw the Velvet Fop born decently to Church. To the same upon his Play's being damn'd, for having too much Eating and Drinking in it. Friend Harry, some furious Pretenders to thinking, Say thy Play is encumbred with eating and drinking, That too oft in all Conscience thy Table's brought out, And unmerciful Healths fly like Hail-shot about. Such a merry Objection who e'er could expect, That does on the Town, and its Pleasures reflect? Are a Dish and a Bottle grown quite out of Fashion? Or have the spruce Beaux found a new Recreation? Else why should these Fops be so monstrous uncivil, As to damn at a Play, what they like at the Devil? Upon persecuting it with Cat-calls. When to Molock of old, by way of Oblation Any Jew of his Son made a wicked Donation. The Priesthood with Trumpets and Drums made a Noise To stifle his Groans, and extinguish his Cries. Thus our fierce modern Heroes, those Jews of the Pit, When to damn a poor Author's Attempt, they think fit, With Cat-calls so dreadful the House they alarm, Lest the Wit of the Play should their Fury disarm: Howe'er they may pass with the rest of the Nation, Tho' their Malice I blame, I commend their Discretion. For 'tis but convenient you'll readily own, That the Beast should perform, what the Man wou'd disown. A Pastoral on the Death of Queen MARY. She's gone! the brightest Nymph that blest the Green. No more the Beauty of her Eyes is seen. Who can from Grief's Extremities refrain? Or in due Bounds the swelling Tide contain? Who can behold this dismal Scene pass by With an unmov'd and unrelenting Eye? London, thou Pride and Glory of our Isle, Tho' in thy Bosom both the Indies smile; Oh! ne'er forget that unauspicious Day, Which thy best Treasure rudely snatch'd away. Thy busy Change be for a Season dumb, No saucy Mirth within thy Mansions come; Let all thy Sons in mourning Weeds appear; Each Face shew Sorrow, and each Eye a Tear. T'express their Duty, let all Hearts combine, And on this black, this sad Occasion join. Mourn drooping Britain, mourn from Shore to Shore, Thy best belov'd MARIA is no more. Ye beauteous Virgins, that in moving Strains Were us'd to sing her Virtues on the Plains: Ye Shepherds too, who out of pious Care, Taught every Tree Maria's Name to wear; Your rural Sports and Garlands lay aside, This is no Time for ornamental Pride; But bring, oh! bring the Treasures of your Fields, That short-liv'd Wealth which unbid Nature yields. The mourning Hyacinth inscrib'd mith Woe, The beauteous Lillies that in Vallies grow; And all the Flowers that scatter'd up and down, Or humble Mead, or lofty Mountains crown; Then gently throw them all upon her Herse; To these join lasting Bays, and living Verse. Mourn drooping Britain, mourn from Shore to Shore, Thy best belov'd MARIA is no more. Ye dauntless Hearts, that for your Country's Good, All Dangets scorn, and wade thro' Seas of Blood, In heavy Silence march around her Tomb, And then lament your own and England's Doom: For Death has by this single Stroke, done more Than when (ten Thousand slain) he stalks in Gore, Ye pensive Matrons, who by Fortune crost, In foreign Fields have dear Relations lost; Now give a free and open Vent to Grief, Banish all Hopes, and think of no Relief; That bounteous Princess, who so justly knew What was to blooming Worth and Merit due, Who as she lov'd on Valour still to smile, Ne'er fail'd to recompence the Soldier's Toil; Is now (malicious Fate would have it so) Hurry'd, alas! to the dark Shades below. Mourn drooping Britain, mourn from Shore to Shore, Thy best belov'd MARIA is no more. Ye mitr'd Heads, and likewise you that wait Upon the Altar in a lower State, Bewail the Loss of so divine a Prize, And open all the Sluces of your Eyes. Rome's gaudy Pomps her Mind could ne'er allure; Firm to her Word, and in her Faith secure. The sacred Scriptures were her daily Care, Her only Exercise and Food, was Prayer. Where can we now so great a Pattern find? Where can we meet so bright, so pure a Mind? Mourn drooping Britain, mourn from Shore to Shore, Thy best belov'd MARIA is no more. But tho' proud Fate has done her utmost Spite, And bury'd all her Hopes in endless Night; Tho' rav'nous Death has seiz'd the richest Prey That ever did a Regal Scepter sway; Her Name shall live, and still continue fair, Fragrant as rich Arabia's Spices are: While Albion in triumphant State shall reign Queen of the Isles, and Goddess of the Main. While silver Thames in wanton Folds shall play, And Tribute to the British Ocean pay: While haughty Lewis shall remain abhorr'd, And William be by all the World ador'd. Our grateful Tongues her Virtue shall proclaim Thro' all the distant Provinces of Fame: Still in our Hearts shall chast MARIA reign, Tho' dead, her Station there she shall maintain. Then Shepherds leave at last your mournful Lays, And turn your Songs of Grief, to Songs of Praise. Prologue to a Musick Speech in the Theatre in Oxford. Well! for a careful provident Bawd, say I, Give me my Mother University. Bless us! how neatly has she rank'd you here, Where drawn in Love's Battalia, you appear The Black, the Brown, the Fair, and the not Fair. I must confess the Case is alter'd now, From what your narrow fulsome Box could show. A Musick-Room, a fitter Name 'twould prove, Call it a Stove, a Bathing-Tub of Love, Where sweating Scholar faints, and knows not why, And melting Tallow-Chandler drips hard by, And all this Heat from Love, or else July. But now you're welcome hither, in this Row Painting does in its full Perfection show, Streter above you, Ladies here below. Did not such Malice in your Beauties reign, We yet might hope a Golden Age again: When Nature taught her untold Tale of Love, And Passion from a ragged Gown could move. But now those Days are gone, and saucy Art, Mimick of Nature, acts the noblest Part. E'en Passion is successless in this Age, Unless set off by Love's high Equipage. The ruffling Pantaloon declares the Flame, And the well ty'd Cravat-string wins the Dame. Plain Lovers, like plain Linnen, e'er cashier'd, In whose behalf no Point has e'er appear'd: What Hopes then have unhappy we to please, Whom niggard Stars made not so vain as these? Alas! we hate your gentle stinking Water, Loath distill'd Oils, but those of Mother Nature. This knew our Fates, and plac'd us in a Town Where Beauty is so thin, so rarely sown; The Nymphs o'th' Fleece, and the three Gates go down. Like homely Peasants, us'd to wholesome Meat, When Love invites us to your splendid Treat; We'll gape and gaze, and make no hearty Meal, Give us our sturdy Beef and Mutton still. But let us not despair. I'll lead the Van, And tho' I proudly say't, we Scholars can, Altho' not act the Fop, yet play the Man. We'll run at all, and freely take our Lot, From the fair Walcop, down to foul Bess Scot. The EPILOGUE. As from a darken'd Room, some Optick Glass Transmits the distant Species as they pass; The World's large Landskip is from far descry'd, And Men contracted on the Paper glide. Thus crowded Oxford repesents Mankind, And in these Walls Great-Britain seems confin'd. Oxford is now the publick Theatre, And you both Audience and Actors are: The gazing World on the new Scene attend, Admire the Turns, and wish a prosp'rous End. Oxford, the Seat of Peace, the quiet Cell, Where Arts, remov'd from noisy Business, dwell; Should calm your Minds, unite the jarring Parts, And with a kind Contagion seize your Hearts. O! may its Genius like soft Musick move, And tune you all to Concord and to Love. Our Acts which has in Tempest long been tost, Could never rest on so secure a Coast. From hence you may look back on civil Rage, And view the Ruins of the former Age. Here a new World its Glories may unfold, And here be sav'd the Remnant of the old: But while our Thoughts on publick Cares are bent, Past Ills to heal, and future to prevent, Some vacant Hours allow to your Delight; Mirth is the pleasing Bus'ness of the Night, The King's Prerogative, the Subject's Right. Were all your Hearts to sullen Cares confin'd, The Body would be weary'd by the Mind. 'Tis Wisdom's part, betwixt Extreams to steer, Be Gods in Senate, but be Mortals here. Upon Mr. Creech's Translation of Lucretius. 1. Let not the Thracian Bard admire, Whose powerful Strains, and list'ning Stones inspire, To keep just Measures with his Lyre; Tho' taught by his commanding Harmony, The Beasts forgot their Native Cruelty, And to a universal Peace did jointly all conspire. 2. Thy sacred Hand does more, That does Lucretius again restore, Who was a mighty Solitude before: His rowling Atoms now we see, In Squadrons and just Measures lie, Even in Confusion now appears just Symmetry, 3. Nought but a heav'nly Hand could make These Atoms their old Nothing forsake, And a true decent Order take: Thy charitable Hand has greatet Wonders done, And has Lucretius his own Errors shown: Our modern Atheist grieves to see His belov'd Sins so lash'd by thee, That do'st in this deserve ev'n of Posterity. What Trophies can thy Victory out-do, That triumph'st o'er the present Times, the past, and future too? Algernon Sidney's Letter of Advice to his Friend, concerning the Education of his Son. By T. Brown. Since 'tis your only Study, and your Care, How to dispose of Bob, your Son and Heir, I'll give you my Advice, Sir, in this grand Affair, If Bob's ingenious, and a Boy of Parts, Do not debauch him with the lib'ral Arts. Those jilting Whores, instead of Silk and Satin, Equipt in Linsey-woolsey, Greek, and Latin, Will spoil his Fortune if they once come at him. But if he is mercurially inclin'd; Of Wit sagacious, and heroic Mind, He'd best pursue those honourable Courses Of picking Pockets, and of taking Purses; And I'll prescribe the Lad a safe and true Gate, How to avoid the dreaded Path of Newgate; Lest bloody Judge and Jury should transport The Boy to Tyburn—Send him to the Court; Where in a Fortnight's Time he'll learn his Cue, Under— To pick the Pockets of a free-born Nation, In furnishing two Dishes for Collation: Like learned Cooks, as all Men grant they are, To make the self-same Sauce to Peace and War What better are we for this boasted Quiet, If we must pawn our Birth-right for our Diet? But since it is by Providence decreed, That Liberty and Property must bleed; This only Comfort will their Suff'rings ease, That, like good Christians, they depart in Peace. You cannot, Sir, do better for your Lad, Than bind him an Apprentice to this Trade: The King's his Surety, and will not neglect him, But with a Standing-Army still protect him. Yet if Bob's Talent lie not in his Brains, Make him a Parson, Neighbour, by all Means. His Road unto Preferment, Sir, is chalk'd, In all my Life I ne'er knew Blockhead balk'd. As rankest Weeds in richest Soil are found, So Spiritual Hemlock thrives in Holy Ground. The Church and State, like Sharpers, cry out halves, One claims the Fools, the other all the Knaves. Thus, Sir, I've shewn you how your Son may rise But do as seemeth good in your own Eyes: For if your English Stomach can't digest The rav'ning Courtier, or the Jackal Priest, Teach him your self, and let the Son inherit His Father's Acres, and his Father's Merit; E'er Sense, that, like Aurora, does make Way For brighter Reason the ensuing Day. With Noll's great Image fill his dawning Soul, His Fancy flatter, and his Judgment rule. May's Actions suit unto his Country's Fame, And keep the Rebel in the English Name. Let him, like me, all Monarchy oppose, And pluck the Idol by his Roman Nose. Your Servant, Algernon Sidney. P. S. Your old Friend Mr. Ludlow's in good Health, And hopes to live to see a Commonwealth. TO Dr. SHERLOCK, ON Occasion of his taking the Oaths, 1690. And have you now at length resolv'd to take The Oath, so long refus'd for Conscience sake? So fam'd a Champion for the Loyal Church, (So call'd) to leave her, and her Friends, i'th' Lurch! Doctor, in short, you have amaz'd us all, Making that Nothing you Religion call. Had you comply'd at first, 't had been a Jest, And you no more to blame, than were the rest; But after such mature Deliberation, (Preaching up Loyalty in spite o'th' Nation) At last to turn Apostate on a sudden, Shews, tho' a Church-man, that you are no good One. The Senseless Book y' have Writ in your Defence; Discovers more your Guilt, than Innocence: Each Argument therein does seem to say, Your Reason, with Religion, 's fled away. Now some pretend you tempted were by Woman, Nay, by a Wife, which is a thing not common, To Sin against the Laws Divine and Humane: Her Importunity was such, they say, When you did Preach, she never ceas'd to Pray; Until at length, by force of much Perswasion, She brought your Doctorship into the Fashion, To take an Oath, to justify the Reign Of William, till King James return'd again. But, Doctor, most believe what she cou'd say, Had not prevail'd to make you go astray, And with the present Government to join, If little William had not past the Boyn: But now you from your Principles do swerve, For fear that you and yours shou'd come to starve; Trusting to Providence (it seems) your Soul, But for your Body, you're not such a Fool. Doctor, in fine, you'll live to curse your Fate, And then repent, (alas!) when 'tis too late! Reproachful Ruin still such Crimes attends; Your Friends you've made your Foes, your Foes no Friends. AN EPITAPH ON Dr. SHERLOCK, 1707. I Here lyes, within this Holy Place, (The Lord have Mercy on him!) The Weesel, in a Wooden Case, Exempt from Human Plagues, unless You lay his Wife upon him. II Some People think, if this were done, Tho' Dead, he wou'd be ready To rise before his Time, and run The Lord knows where, to shun That Termagant, his Lady. III Since he is gone, 'tis hard that she Should be so long deserted. Why, Death, shouldst thou so partial be, Since all good People do agree, 'Tis pity they were parted? IV Pray bid her, when she comes, not prate, But hold her teazing Nonsense: For if the Weesel smell a Rat, He'll fly his Wife, I'll tell you that, As he once did his Conscience.
