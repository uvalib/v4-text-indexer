      <field name="fulltext">ÃSOPI FabulÃ¦. FAB. I. De Gallo Gallinaceo. A Cock who to a neighbouring Dunghill tries, Finding a gemme that 'mongst the Rubish lyes. Cry'd heâa Barly corne woud please me more, Then all the Treasures on the eastern shore. Morall Gay nonsense does the noysy fopling please, Beyond the noblest Arts and Sciences. FAB. II. De Lupo &amp; Agno. A Wolf who at the Rivers head did drink, Seeing a trembling Lambe upon the brink, Disdaining that should tast what he injoys, First quarrells, then the innocent destroys. Morall Thus the proud great by lawless might opress, While the complaining poore find no redress. FAB. III. De Leone &amp; quatuor Tauris. The Lyon saw three Bulls securely feed, By murmuring springs, in a large flowery mead, First by perswasive power the friends diuide, Then makes 'em fall, the Ravage of his Pride. Morall Thus mighty states, are to Confusion hurld, Which when united woud subdue the world. FAB. IV. De RanÃ¢, &amp; Vulpe. A Bog borne Frog a Doctor woud commence, And the dull Heard trust his false Eloquence, But the more subtile Fox in scorne replyes, To give me faith, cure thy owne maladyes. Morall Vaine are the precepts they to others give, Who do themselves, in ill Examples live. FAB. VI. De Asino Rubos comedente. A sordid Ass while on his back he bore, Of chosen delicates, a plenteous store; His courser Appetite with Thistles treats, And starves beneath his load of nobler meats. Morall Profusenes is a farr less dangerous vice Than the Ill natur'd damning Avarice. FAB. VI. De AlaudÃ¢, &amp; pullis ejus. When the old Lark did heare y? nighbouring swaines Woud joyn to cutt the corne she still remains, But when she heard the owner, and his sone, Would do't themselves, she cry'dâthen let's be gone Morall Services done by friends come slowly on, He acts himselfe, who has his work well done. FAB. VII. De Vulpe, Cane, &amp; Gallo. The Fox perswades the Cock, to quit his shade, Since betweene Birds, and Beasts, a truce was made. But he secur'd amidst the hinder boughs, Reply'd, I'll first be certaine of your news. Morall The wise from publick fame no judgments make, But such as they from righter reasoning take. FAB. VIII. The Fox in the Well. The Fox in a deep well implores the aid, Of a grace wolfe, who many questions made, How he came there, the Fox halfe drown'd replyes Oh cease vaine words &amp; help thy friend that ayes. Morall Men oft good Counsell can bestow in griefe, But with no reall good will bring reliefe. FAB. IX. The Wolves and Sheep. A truce concluded, was twixt wolves, and sheepe, The wolves, their dogs as a firm hostage keepe, The Sheepe, their whelps who with design complaine, Their Dames break in and slaughter o're the plaine. Morall Those who with foes too mighty make a peace, Give 'em but power to hurt 'em with more ease. FAB. X. The Eagle's Nest. A Foxes cub the kingly Eagle prest, And bore the trembler to her royall nest, The Fox inrag'd, the sacred Pile will burne, To save her throne the prise she does returne. Morall The haughty great with caution shoud oppress, Since Slaves provok'd deep injuryes may redress. FAB. XI. The Wolf in Sheeps Clothing. A subtile Wolfe, more safly to betray, In a sheepes Clothing does himselfe aray, And unexpected now whole flocks destroys, Till a kind halter ends his stoln joys. Morall The zealous Cheat has wrought the land more woe, Than bare fac'd villainie coud ever doe. FAB. XII. The Ringdove and Fowler. While the young fouler sought, with eager skill, A Ring Dove in a neighbouring Tree to kill. An Adder in the floury mead beneath, Slung the unhappy youth, and stung to death. Moral The young usurper, who design'd t'invade, An others right, himselfe the victim made. FAB. XIII. The Sow and her Pigs. The Wolf intreats the Sow, that he might be, A guard to keep her Pigs from injury, The Sow, who knew the nature of the Beast Replydâwhen absent, S? you'l guard 'em best. Morall Belive not those who often Friendship swear, Least they som privat Intrest woud prefer. FAB. XIV. The Horse and Ass. A Horse, whom guilded Equipage made gay Commands a Drudging Ass to yield the way, But when diseasd, and to a Cart condemn'd, The Ass lookt big, and his owne form esteem'd. Morall The great are often lost in stormes of State, While the poore Cottager despises fate. FAB. XV. The Wolf and Goat. The Wolf endeavor'd to perswade the Lamb, To leave her Gardian Goat, and to her Damm To trust her selfe with him, but she reply'd, I know his friendship, yours I never try'd. Morall He that old Loves, and Friends forsakes for new, Deserves no Mistress, nor a friend that's true. FAB. XVI. The Doves and Hawk. Twixt Doves and Kites a Combatt rose while they The Spar hawk chose for King beneath whose sway The Doves with greater rage opprest complaine And wish lesse Tyrant Kite woud reigne againe. Morall We nere are pleas'd with what the Gods bestow To worse we change when ere we change for new. FAB. XVII. The City Mouse and Country Mouse. The City Mouse invites her Country Guest, To tast the dainlyes of a Citty feast, But oft disturbd by interupted noys, They hide, and fear his appetite destroys. Morall The great the Hurry of the world indure, And tis the country life alone's secure. FAB. XVIII. The Swallow and other Birds. The Swallow saw pernicious Hempseed sowne, And vow'd to spoyle the Tillage of the Clowne, The Birds are summond, but they being slow Permite that weed that ruins 'em to grow. Morall They that neglect the Councell of the wise, Suffer small faults to grow past remedies. FAB. XIX. The Hunted Beaver. The hunted Beaver knowing what sweet Prise, Woud make him to the dogs a sacrifise, Bites of the prey, and ends the eager strife, And with the loss of treasure bailes his life. Morall Who woud not part with momentary Toys, To purchass to themselves eternall joys. FAB. XX. The Fox and Cat. The Fox pretends a thousand shifts t'ave found, To save him from the hard persuing Hound, The Catt but one, who climes the Tree amaine. Anon the dogs persue, and Renards slaine Morall One Action where discretion is its guide, Transcends all the results of noys and pride. FAB. XXI. The Cat and Mice. The Mice consult, how to prevent their fate By timely notice of th' aproaching Catt, We'll hang a Bell about her neck, cryd one, A third replydâbut who shall putt it on. Morall Good Councell's easy given, but y? effect Oft renders it uneasy to transact. FAB. XXII. The Lyon and other Beasts. Hunting, the beasts agree to share the Prey One part the Lyon claimes as bearing sway, An other for his strength, a third his toyle, The last in gratitude they ought to make his spoile Morall Proud Senatts thus by easy Monarchs thrive Incroaching on their whole prerogative. FAB. XXIII. The Lyon and Mouse. The Royall Beast intangl'd in a snare, Coud not with teeth, and claws the ambush tear, When a kind humble Mouse, the Cord untwind, And broke that Mase the Forest King confind. Morall Doe not despise the Service of a Slave, An Oak did once a glorious Monarch save. FAB. XXIV. The Lion and Mouse. The Mouse for his late service fild with pride, Demands the Royall virgin for his bride, The match agreed while he in flames admird, He unawares crusht by her paw expird. Morall To false ambition if thy thoughts are bent, Reflect on a late pittyed president. FAB. XXV. The Dog with a Clog. A Dog whose fierceness was with fetters checkt, Fancyd himselfe with some new honour deckt, Thy folly's great the wiser currs replye, For glory, to mistake thy infamie. Morall Thus dareing debauchee do often boast, In those loose vices men dishonour most. FAB. XXVI. The Ox and Toad. The Toad woud needs the Oxes size attaine, And with fell poyson puffs up every veine, Then askd her sone if equall were their size, Then swells againe, and with her penome dyes. Morall The woud-bee witts to Lawrrels woud aspire, And write till damn'd they shamefully retire. FAB. XXVII. The Lion and Fox. When first the Fox the forest monarch saw, He gaz'd with trembling feare &amp; reverend awe, But by degrees more boldly he adrest, Than holds a Parly with the Royall Beast. Morall Vertues seem rigid to the wild and loose, But grow familiar by their constant use. FAB. XXVIII. The Ape and Fox. The Ape implord, the fox her bum woud vaile, With a proportion of his useless Taile, But he replydâtho me no good it do, I will not spare an Inch to favour you. Morall Thus the Ill naturd Rich reserve their store, And please themselves to see their nighbours poor. FAB. XXIX. The Dog and Ox. An Envious Dog in a full manger lay, Nor eats himselfe, nor to the Ox gives way, Who griev'd reply'dâah grudge not me that meat, Which (cruell) thou thy selfe disdainst to eate. Morall Thus aged Lovers with young Beautys live, Keepe off those joys they want the power to give. FAB. XXX. The Birds and Beasts. Twixt birds and beasts a fatall warr is held, The winged powers are conquers ore the field, The Batt is captive tane whom all detest For she forsook her nation and her nest. Morall A Traytor all behold with just disdaine, Who basely quitts his cause, and soveraigne. FAB. XXXI. The Tigre and Fox. The Tyger boasts to guard the Beasts from harme, Since his tough hide so well his vitals arme, Which the young hunter heareing sent a dart, That pierc'd the fancy'd victor to the heart. Morall So the young Hero on his strength relying, Renderd him more remark'd and worthyer dying. FAB. XXXII. The Lionness and Fox. The Fox will with the Lyoness compaire, For noble Reace, cause she does numbers bear, Who thus reply'dâtho I but one do bring That one shall rule thy numbers as their King Morall 'Tis not a gawdy title formes the great Who shoud with nobler vertue be repleat. FAB. XXXIII. The Oak and Reed. The wind bore downe a mighty Oake that stood, To shade the margent of a silver flood, Who seeing the Reed unruffl'd by the storme, He dying, wisht that he'd been humbly borne. Morall He that to elivated hights arrives Is oft in stormes and still in danger lives. FAB. XXXIV. The Wind and Sun. Opprest with wind the Traveller girts on, His warm Surtoul anon the rageing Sun, With his fierce beames does incomode him more, Then all the ill supported storme before. Morall In every passion moderation chuse, For all extreames doe bad effects produce. FAB. XXXV. The Kite, Frog, and Mouse. The Frog and Mouse themselves to armes betake, To fight for the Dominion of the Lake, But while in field the boasting Champions dare, The Kite makes both her prey, so ends the warr Morall The fond aspiring youth who empire sought By dire ambition was to ruine brought. FAB. XXXVI. Jupiter and the Frogs. The Frogs implore a king, and Iupiter To please the Rable does king Log preffer, But too unactive heâagain they implore, Iove sends the Stork who does the fooles devour. Morall If Kings be mild they'r dull, if active they We blast 'em with the guilt of Tyrant sway. FAB. XXXVII. The old Woman and her Maids. When the shrill Cock told that the morn was nigh, The good-wife calls her maids to Houswifry, But they too soone awackt the telltale kill, And now their Dame calls earlyer w?? a Bell. Morall He who to cure his love to drinking runes Contracts a greater evill then he shunes. FAB. XXXVIII. The Lion and Bear. The Bear and Lyon on a summers day, A combate held for the divided prey, When both growne faint with fatigues of wart, Suffer the fox the prize away to beare. Morall Thus nations oft by Civill Conflicts torne By a third power away the scepter's borne. FAB. XXXIX. The Crow and Pot. A thirsty Crow the medow did survey, But found no streame her faintings to allay, Till in the Bottom of a Pott, whose drink She boys with pebles to the kinder brink. Morall One wisely manag'd pleasure brings more joys, Than all dull fancy can create with noyse. FAB. XL. The Porcupines and Adders. The Aders had the Porcupines deceiv'd Of their warme Nest which coud not be retrieu'd, By subtillty possession first was gain'd, But now by force the title is mentain'd. Morall Crownes got by force are often times made good, By the more rough designes of warr, and blood. FAB. XLI. The Hares and Storm. The Hares in storms to close recesses hye, And thro' a scanted breach themselves convey, But when they find a Lake they must wade thro' Forward they dare not, backward can not goe. Morall When counsell'd thus by a more prudent Hare What can't be remedied with patience bear FAB. XLII. The Fox and Wolf. A Fox does to a Hunters rage betray A Lambe gorg'd wolf who close in kenelld lay, The conquering Swain his Iustice to evince First kills the wolf, and then the Evidence. Morall From this that certaine truth we may inferr Who loves the guilt, heats the discoverer. FAB. XLIII. The Dog and Sheep. The Dog impeacht a Sheep of Crimes unthought, And the false wolf, and Kite for wittnes brought, The innocent by perjury betrayd, Is to the black caball a victim made. Morall He that woud search for presidents so base, Let him survey our home bread perjurd Race. FAB. XLIV. The Crane and Peacock. The gay plumd Peacock w?? a nice disdaine, Scornd the cheap clothing of y? humbler Crane, But she replyd, my wings can reach y? skye, Thy duller beautys do but please the eye. Morall Scorn not the courser sort whose mind may be Richer then thou, with all thy pedigree. FAB. XLV. The Viper and File. An hungry Viper neare a Black Smiths forge, Snatcht at a file his eager maw to gorge, But the tough steele his feebler teeth repells, Its dinted force his jaws with anguish fills. Morall Contend not with a power too great t'orecome, Least toyle and shame become thy certaine doome. FAB. XLVI. The Lion, Ass, and Cock. The Lyon meets the Cock, whose early straynes, Frights the rough forest monarch ore the plaines, The Ass who thought his presence made him scowre, Persuing, falls a victim to his power. Morall The forward spark who thinks his noys may pass Incountering sense perceives himself an Ass. FAB. XLVII. The Jay and Peacock. The Jay woud for a gawdy Peacock pass, And with their borowed plumes her tayle dos grace But when from thence each had his feathers torne, By her own Birds she is receiv'd with scorne. Morall Tis the gay Dress that makes the Lover doat, Not the fine Soule, but the fine Petticoat. FAB. XLVIII. The Ant and Fly. The Fly thus to the Antsâpoore humble things, You live on Dunghills, while I feast with Kings, The Ant reply'dâthy feasts by thift are gaind, Mine tho with toyle, are with repose mayntaind. Morall The humble life the Rurall Swain injoys, Exceeds High Birth with all its pomp &amp; noys. FAB. XLIX. The Ant and Grashopper. The wanton Grashopper implores the Ant In winter season to relive her want, But she replydâthou all the plentious spring Took'st care for nought, but how to dance and sing.
