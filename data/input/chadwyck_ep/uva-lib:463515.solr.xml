      <field name="fulltext">Poems from Songbooks. I. [Let not thy beauty make thee proud] Let not thy beauty make thee proud Though Princes do adore thee, Since time &amp; sicknes were alow'd To mow such flowers before thee. Nor be not shy to that degree, Thy friends may hardly know thee, Nor yet so comming or so free, That every fly may blow thee. A state in every Princely brow, As decent is requir'd, Much more in thine, to whom they bow By Beauties lightnings fir'd. And yet a state so sweetly mixt With an attractive mildnesse, It may like Vertue sit betwixt The extreams of pride and vilenesse. Then every eye that sees thy face Will in thy Beauty glory, And every tongue that wags will grace Thy vertue with a story. II. To the Countesse of Salisbury. Victorious beauty, though your eyes Are able to subdue an hoast, And therefore are unlike to boast The taking of a little prize, Do not a single heart dispise. It came alone, but yet so arm'd With former love, I durst have sworne That where a privy coat was worne, With characters of beauty charm'd, Thereby it might have scapt unharm'd. But neither steele nor stony breast Are proofe against those lookes of thine, Nor can a Beauty lesse divine Of any heart be long possest, Where thou pretend'st an interest. Thy Conquest in regard of me Alasse is small, but in respect Of her that did my Love protect, Were it divulged, deserv'd to be Recorded for a Victory. And such a one, as some that view Her lovely face perhaps may say, Though you have stolen my heart away, If all your servants prove not true, May steale a heart or two from you. III. Youth and Beauty. Thou art so fair, and yong withall, Thou kindl'st yong desires in me, Restoreing life to leaves that fall, And sight to Eyes that hardly see Halfe those fresh Beauties bloom in thee. Those, under sev'rall Hearbs and Flowr's Disguis'd, were all Medea gave, When she recal'd Times flying howrs, And aged Ãson from his grave, For Beauty can both kill and save. Youth it enflames, but age it cheers, I would go back, but not return To twenty but to twice those yeers; Not blaze, but ever constant burn, For fear my Cradle prove my Urn. IV. A Dialogue betwixt Time and a Pilgrime. Pilgr. Aged man, that mowes these fields. Time. Pilgrime speak, what is thy will? Pilgr. Whose soile is this that such sweet Pasture yields? Or who art thou whose Foot stand never still? Or where am I? Time. In love. Pilgr. His Lordship lies above. Time. Yes and below, and round about Where in all sorts of flow'rs are growing Which as the early Spring puts out, Time fals as fast a mowing. Pilgr. If thou art Time, these Flow'rs have Lives, And then I fear, Under some Lilly she I love May now be growing there. Time. And in some Thistle or some spyre of grasse, My syth thy stalk before hers come may passe. Pilgr. Wilt thou provide it may. Time. No. Pilgr. Alleage the cause. Time. Because Time cannot alter but obey Fates laws. Cho. Then happy those whom Fate, that is the stronger, Together twists their threads, &amp; yet draws hers the longer. V. A Bacchanall. Bacchus, I-acchus, fill our Brains As well as Bowls with sprightly strains: Let Souldiers fight for pay or praise, And mony be the Misers wish, Poor Schollers study all their dayes, And Gluttons glory in their dish: 'Tis wine, pure wine, revives sad souls, Therefore give us the cheer in Bowls. Bacchus, I-acchus, &amp;c. Bacchus, I-acchus, &amp;c. Let Minions Marshall ev'ry hair, Or in a Lovers lock delight, And Artificiall colours wear, We have the Native Red and White: 'Tis Wine, pure Wine, &amp;c. Bacchus, I-acchus, &amp;c. Take Phesant Poults, and calved Sammon, Or how to please your pallats think, Give us a salt West-phalia Gammon, Not meat to eat, but meat to drink: 'Tis Wine, pure Wine, &amp;c. Bacchus, I-acchus, &amp;c. Some have the Ptisick, some the Rhume, Some have the Palsie, some the Gout, Some swell with fat, and some consume, But they are sound that drink all out: 'Tis Wine, pure Wine, &amp;c. Bacchus, I-acchus, &amp;c. The backward spirit it makes brave, That forward which before was dull; Those grow good fellows that were grave, And kindness flows from cups brim full: 'Tis Wine, pure Wine, &amp;c. Bacchus, I-acchus, &amp;c. Some men want Youth, and some want health, Some want a Wife and some a Punke, Some men want wit, and some want wealth, But they want nothing that are drunke: 'Tis Wine, pure Wine, &amp;c. VI. In praise of his Mistress. Thou Shepheard, whose intentive eye On ev'ry Lamb is such a spy, No wily Fox can make them lesse, Where may I find my Shepheardess? A little pausing then sayd hee, How can that Jewell stray from thee? In Summers heat, in Winters cold, I thought thy brest had been her fold? That is indeed the constant place Wherein my thoughts still see her face, And print her Image in my heart, But yet my fond eyes crave a part. With that he smiling sayd, I might Of Chloris partly have a sight, And some of her perfections meet In ev'ry flow'r was fresh and sweet. The growing Lilly bears her skin, The Violet her blew veins within, The blushing Rose, new blown and spread, Her sweeter cheek, her lips, the red. The Winds that wanton with the Spring Such Odours as her breathing bring, But the resemblance of her eyes Was never found beneath the skies. Her charming voyce who strives to hit, His Object must be higher yet; For Heav'n and Earth, and all we see Dispersed, collected, is but shee. Amaz'd at this discourse, me thought Love both Ambition in me wrought, And made me covet to engrosse A Wealth would prove a Publick losse. With that I sigh'd ashamed to see Such worth in her, such want in mee; And closing both mine eyes, forbid The World my sight since she was hid. VII. Sufferance. Delicate Beauty, why should you disdaine With pity at least to lessen my pain? Yet if you purpose to render no cause, Will and not Reason is Judge of those Lawes. Suffer in silence I can with delight Courting your Anger to live in your sight, Inwardly languish, and like my disease, Alwaies provided my sufferance please. Take all my comforts in present away, Let all but the hope of your favour decay, Rich in reversion Ile live as content, As he to whom Fortune her fore lock hath lent. VIII. [When we were parted] When we were parted, Though but for a while, From my brest started A post ev'ry mile: But I feare, none were directed From your bosome to me; For a beauty so affected Looks for Love custome free. Tis then no marveill My state should decay, Brought to be servil And kept from my pay. But ingratefull to the giver, Know the Sea as your King Can as well exhaust a river, As you suck up a spring. And though triumphing You rowle to the Main, Small streames are something And part of your train. Use me gently then that follow, Made by custome so tame, I am silent whilest you swallow Both my tears, and my name. IX. On his hearing her Majesty sing. I have beene in Heav'n, I thinke, For I heard an Angell sing, Notes my thirsty ears did drinke. Never any earthly thing Sung so true, so sweet, so cleere; I was then in Heav'n, not heere. But the blessed feele no change, So I may mistake the place, But mine eyes would think it strange, Should that be no Angels face; Pow'rs above, it seems, designe Me still Mortall, her Divine. Till I tread the Milky way, And I lose my sences quite, All I wish is that I may Hear that voice, and see that sight, Then in types and outward show I shall have a Heav'n below</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poems from Manuscripts. X. To the Lady May. Your smiles are not, as other womens bee, Only the drawing of the mouth awrye; For breasts and cheekes and fforehead wee may see, Parts wanting motion, all stand smiling by. Heaven hath noe mouth, and yet is sayd to smile After your stile; Noe more hath Earth, yet that smyles too, Just as you doe. Noe sympering lipps nor lookes can breed Such smyles as from your fface proceed. The sunn must lend his goulden beames, Soft windes their breath, green trees their shade, Sweete ffields their flowers, cleare springs their streams, Ere such another smyle bee made. But these concurring, wee may say, Soe smiles the spring, and soe smyles louely Maye. XI [Though regions farr devided] Though regions farr devided And tedious tracts of tyme, By my misfortune guided, Make absence thought a cryme; Though wee weare set a sunder As ffarr, as East from West, Loue still would worke this wonder, Thou shouldst be in my breast. How slow alasse are paces, Compar'd to thoughts that flye In moment back to places, Whole ages scarce descry. The body must have pauses; The mynde requires noe rest; Loue needs no second causes To guide thee to my breast. Accept in that poore dwelling, But welcome, nothing great, With pride noe turretts swelling, But lowly as the seate; Wher, though not much delighted, In peace thou mayst be blest, Unfeasted yet unfrighted By rivalls, in my breast. But this is not the dyett, That doeth for glory striue; Poore beawties seeke in quiet To keepe one heart aliue. The price of his ambition, That lookes for such a guest, Is hopelesse of fruition To beate an empty breast. See then my last lamenting. Upon a cliffe I'le sitt, Rock Constancy presenting, Till I grow part of itt; My teares a quicksand ffeeding, Wher on noe ffoote can rest, My sighs a tempest breeding About my stony breast. Those armes, wherin wide open Loues fleete was wont to putt, Shall layd acrosse betoken That havens mouth is shutt. Myne eyes noe light shall cherish For shipps att sea distrest, But darkeling let them perish Or splitt against my breast. Yet if I can discouer When thyne before itt rides, To shew I was thy louer I'le smooth my rugged sides, And soe much better measure Afford thee then the rest, Thou shalt haue noe displeasure By knocking att my breast. XII. [Come not to me for scarfs, nor plumes] Come not to me for scarfs, nor plumes, Nor from the needy look for gould; Incense wee haue, but noe perfumes, Nor noe such fleece in all our ffold, As Jason wonn, But wooll home spunn To keepe us from the winters cold; And when our garments should be thinne, We leaue the ffleece and take the skinn; Which heere we neither pinke, nor race, Unlesse a bramble or a thorne, Deriding of the printers place, Supply his offices in scorne; Nor yet much lesse Striue to possesse Things that might be as well forborne. What wee can spare, wee neuer lack; A sheapheards wardrobe is his back. Our roofes are low, our cabins small, Our loues, as well as loaues, are browne, Yet soe contented there withall, Wee seeke noe finer in the towne; ffor thach and mudd Sometimes haue stood, When lead and marble weare blowne downe, And loue, they say, as often rests In sunnburnt, as in snowy breasts. And by my sheapheards kalander, Tis loue alone, thou com'st to seeke, And our predictions seldome erre, ffor though unstudied in the Greeke Or Hebrew tongue, Sheapheards haue sung Southsayings, which the learned like, And I may hitt perhaps on this Upon a trueth when doctors misse. The pulcee of loue beates in our eyes, And when that goes as quick as yours, Admit the patient seldom dies, Experience noe such life assures; ffor as the stone Kills not alone, But ffeavers frequently procures, Which deaths sadd offices fullfill, Soe loue must cease, or death will kill. Take but the country aire a while, And if thou wilt descend soe lowe, To please thyne eare, wee'll raise our stile, Which soe refind perhaps may grow, Thy hearing sence Shall not stirr hence, Admit thyne eyes from court doe goe; For euery homely thing we haue, Att least in title, shalbe braue. A mountaine toppe shalbe thy throne, Thy Percian carpetts flowry feildes; Thy cooch with green mosse ouer growne, As unshorne veluet, summer yealds; Thy lamp by night The constant light, That glisters, wher the gloworme builds, Thy sparver a well tufted tree, Ore heaven itselfe, thy canopy. A larke shall call thee from thy rest, And sing thee mattens euery day; The nightingall that warbells best Shall vespers euery evening saye; The wise ant preach, And bees shall teach Us, how to rule, and to obaye; A crane the watch and ward shall keepe, And noe lambe bleat, to breake thy sleepe. And if a ffeather of Loues winges, To slacken and retard his flight, The goulden-headed shaft he brings, Impoverishing his quiver quite, The scarfe fame tyes About his eyes, Thy stepps may hitherward invite, Thou mayst from this tyme forth dispose Of him and vs, and each of those. Thou needes must thinke, I know full well Wher Loue resides, that undertake Without the helpe of charme, or spell, Hee shall soe quick appearance make, Yet thinke withall His power not small, That in the plurall number spake, Though likely to be sick and ill, Hee is so apt to make his will. But as the wisest sorte dispose Of all they haue in perfect health, Least wayward sicknesse fancy those That are unworthy of their wealth, So passion free Doe I by thee, Scorning thou shouldst come in by stealth, Or watch my weakenesse or a ffitt Of loue, and soe inherite itt. Att court new ffashions are not strange, But heere wee euer keepe our old; There loue (they say) consists in change, Heere, after one, all ours are told. The first is last, Because wee cast One hand can but another hold; But they haue loues, wee understand, ffor euery finger of the hand. Brothers and sisters, cosens, freindes, And two scarce parted in the wombe At court, for their peculiar ends, Hard by Loues cradle build their tombe. Heere hee surviues Eyther two liues, Or els ffills up an empty roome; And after such a league beginns, Though strangers borne, wee dye like twinns. And after death the lowly mynde And humble spirite raysed by grace A place in glory sooner finde Than they who vainely seeke a place. Thou mayst soe caught Perhapps be brought, Though slow at first, to mend thy pace, And cast thy purple roabes away, To take a scripp and sheapheards grey. XIII. Pure Simple Love. Hide not thy love and myne shal bee Open and free; No mask dooth well upon thy face. Lett those that meane more hurt provide Love of a guide, Or of some close retyring place. A harmles kisse would make us thinck Love hath no Nectar else to drinck. Our loves are not of age to will Both good and ill, For thine, alas, is but new borne, And myne is yett to yonge to speake. How can they breake Or hold Loves civill Lawes in skorne? Wee might go naked if some spie, Apt to traduce us, stood not by. Had wee been that created paire, Eve half so faire, Or Adam lov'd but half so well, The Serpent could have found no charme To doe us harme, Or had so much as tyme to tell His tale to thee, or I to view An apple where such cherries grew. Yett had hee ledd mee to thy brest, That waye was best To have seduct mee from thy lipp. Those apples tempt mee most; They bee Fruit of that Tree, That made our first forefathers slipp. I dare not touch them least I dye The death thou threatnest with thyne Eye. Yett hee that meanes not to transgres Needes fearr the lesse, For what hath Justice heere to doe But with her skales? Her sword may lye As Useles by, When shee comes downe to Judge us twoe; For no persuations can infect Thyne innocence or my respect. If all the stings of envy laye Strewde in our waye, And tongues to tell of all wee did, As our affection waxeth old, Shall itt growe cold? Loves Elementall fire forbid Such frost and snowe, for past all doubt, If our sparks dye, his fire will out. Though thanckfull hands and eyes may prove Cyphers of love, Yett, till some figure bee prefixt, As oos, by thousands or alone, Stand all for none, So, till our lookes and smiles bee mixt With further meaning, they amount To nothing by a iust account. How golden was that age that lett, When Couples mett, Theire lips and hands doe what they woulde, Left out theire haires and more skinn bare, Then now they dare; For libertie misunderstood Is counted lightnes, and when twoe Maie doe amise, tis thought they doe. Yett since there bee some people still, That meane no ill, The worlde is not so full of sinne, Butt that wee maie finde some place yett Proper and fitt To act our mutuall friendship in, And some Spectators to allowe Of our old loving fashion now. Then will I lay my cheeke to thyne, And thou shalt twyne Thy maiden armes about my neck, And I will compas in thy waste With arms as chaste, And one anothers eyes bedeck With little babies which shall bee Our unpolluted progenee. Besides weele doe such childish things, Though Love have wings, Hee shal bee lothe to fly awaye; And restles tyme, as lothe to passe By with his glase, Shall offer everie foote to staie; One spinn, the next draw out our yeeres, And the third Fate lett fall her sheeres. If anie Lovers of one sort Hether resort, Theyll fitt them with our modest sceanes, And prompted by a wanton eye Quicklie discrye Wee know not what such action meanes, Butt runn awaye and leave the Stage To them and this corrupted age. And if her eyes, clearest and best Of all the rest, Surveigh theise Lynes tract with Loves dart, Presume to ask her, ere you go, Whether or no Shee wilbe pleasd to act her part; Which if shee be ashamd to doe, Intreat her to excuse mee toe. XIV. A Paradox. There is no Louer hee or shee, That euer was or can be false. Tis passion or symplycitie Or some Apostacie that calls Those votaries, those dead folke soe; For if we goe To vowes, to prayers, to paines, to all The penuries Monasticall, No bare foote man, Rock Hermitt or Carthusian, Can in a course of life suruiue More strict or more contemplatiue. For till that sparke of fyre be out, As holy men are not allow'd Among the Saints nor goe aboute To proue them selues in sufferance proud, Soe was there neuer Louer found But under ground; And if he tooke the style before, And name uncanonized wore, People might say, This Saint hath nere a holliday, But like a bold, unbidden Guest, Intrudes uppon anothers feaste. What desperate challenger is he, Before he vanish in his flame, What ere his paines or patience be, That dares assume a Martyrs name; For all the way he goes he's none, Till he be gone. 'Tis death, not dyeing, that must doe This right to them and Louers too, Which they approue, That make and marr the Lawes of loue. Yet better cheape can none acquire This Crowne of thornes, this Robe of fire. 'Tis not a yeare will serue to trye How weake ones faith is or how strong; In this austere Societye Probation lasts a whole life long. No obseruation singlie vowd Is here allow'd. Two heartes must ioyne and then those two Must both alike beleeue and doe; But as a twynn, This colledge takes no fellow in; At home, abroade, in all affaires, They liue, they dye, they goe, by payres. And as two Turtells that haue pearcht And interchangd their feruent eyes, When each in others bosome searcht, If either Male or Female dyes And the liue Bird survyuith still To prune and bill, Not only this that neuer pynde Is thought of some forgettfull kynde, But that's denyde To be a Turtle true that died; So fares it here that past all doubt Th'instinct of Loue findes Louers out. Hard happ when death cannot assure What our whole liues haue deerely bought, But we must Relatiues procure To Answer euery Louing thought. 'Tis much to dye; 'tis more to fynde Two of my minde. XV. [Tis but a while, since in a vestall flame] Sir, Tis but a while, since in a vestall flame Barren, but bright, the Tuders royall name Beloued expir'd; then God a Steward sent With many Tallents, fitt for gouernment. This patriarch did butt two sonnes begett, Whereof one shines, the other sunne is sett. Father and sonne did their first fruits restore Unto the Giuer, and he gave them more, The hopefull Charles and Mary full of grace; And it were courtship out of time and place To prayse them yet, till Men and Women growne Giuing them prayse, we giue them but their owne. Get us a Blacke prince to the white we haue, A Henry Monmoth, and a Richard braue As Coeur de Lion, lineally plac't On thy throne, Charles the fearles, and the chast. And when Greate Brittaine Males enow haue seene To be our Kings, get each Land else a Queene Louely, and louing, as your Machles Bride, Misfortune-free; or else if seauen tymes try'd, Out of that furnace may they come and shyne Like the pure Golden Princesse Pallatine. Meane while, what chosen vessells must they be! That can not wish (vewing their pedigree) An Actiue vertue, or a passiue grace, But may be found in their owne Stocke and Race. May euery Branch of thyne a Scepter growe, And from thy source a Sea of Vertues flowe Aboute the world, till Fame with outstretch't wings Style Charles the Patterne, &amp; the Roote of Kings. A. Tounshend. XVI. An Elegie made by Mr Aurelian Townshend In remembrance of the Ladie Venetia Digby. What Trauellers of matchlesse Venice say, Is true of thee, admir'd Venetia; Hee that ner'e saw thee, wants beleife to reach Halfe those perfections, thy first sight would teach. Imagination can noe shape create AÃ«ry enough thy forme to imitate; Nor bedds of Roses, Damask, red, and white, Render like thee a sweetnes to the sight. Thou wer't eye-Musike, and no single part, But beauties concert; Not one onely dart, But loues whole quiuer; no prouinciall face, But uniuersall; Best in euery place. Thow wert not borne, as other women be, To need the help of heightning Poesie, But to make Poets. Hee, that could present Thee like thy glasse, were superexcellent. Witnesse that Pen which, prompted by thy parts Of minde and bodie, caught as many heartes With euery line, as thou with euery looke; Which wee conceiue was both his baite and hooke. His Stile before, though it were perfect steele, Strong, smooth, and sharp, and so could make us feele His loue or anger, Witneses agree, Could not attract, till it was toucht by thee. Magneticke then, Hee was for heighth of style Suppos'd in heauen; And so he was, the while He sate and drewe thy beauties by the life, Visible Angell, both as maide and wife. In which estate thou did'st so little stay, Thy noone and morning made but halfe a day; Or halfe a yeare, or halfe of such an age As thy complexion sweetly did presage, An houre before those cheerfull beames were sett, Made all men loosers, to paye Natures debt; And him the greatest, that had most to doe, Thy freind, companion, and copartner too, Whose head since hanging on his pensiue brest Makes him looke just like one had bin possest Of the whole world, and now hath lost it all. Doctors to Cordialls, freinds to counsell fall. Hee that all med'cines can exactly make, And freely give them, wanting power to take, Sitts and such Doses howerly doth dispense, A man vnlearn'd may rise a Doctor thence. I that delight most in vnusuall waies, Seeke to asswage his sorrowe with thy praise, Which if at first it swell him vp with greife, At last may drawe, and minister releife; Or at the least, attempting it, expresse For an old debt a freindly thanckfulnesse. I am no Herald! So ye can expect From me no Crests or Scutcheons, that reflect With braue Memorialls on her great Allyes; Out of my reach that tree would quickly rise. I onely stryue to doe her Fame som Right, And walke her Mourner, in this Black and Whight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Commendatory Poems. XVII. To the Right Honourable, the Lord Cary, eldest sonne to the Earle of Monmouth. Verball Translators sticke to the bare Text, Sometimes so close, the Reader is perplex't, Finding the words, to finde the wit that sprung From the first writer in his native tongue. The spirit of an Authour being fled, His naked lines looke like a body dead. Lesse Criticke, more Iudicious, you present No Authour strip't, but full of Ornament: Or rather Galileo-like descry Daily new Starres, and fix them in our skie: Whose distance Davenant showes; How pure they be We heare by Carew, but by you we see. This vertue Suckling sweetly doth expresse; What I can adde, would make those lights seeme lesse. Malvezzi and your Lordship would decline From your true height by a poore praise of mine; The best is then, so weake a braine can doe, In their Gold-scales to weigh both him and you. Your Lordships most humble servant, A. Tounshend. XVIII. To the Incomparable Brothers, Mr. Henry, and Mr. William Lawes (Servants to His Majestie) upon the setting of these Psalmes. The various Musick, both for Aire and Art, These Arch-Musicians, in their sev'rall waies Compos'd, and Acted, merit higher praise Then wonder wanting knowledge can impart. Brothers in blood, in Science and Affection, Belov'd by those that envie their Renowne, In a False Time true Servants to the Crowne, Lawes of themselves, needing no more direction. The depth of Musique one of them did sound, The t'other took his flight into the aire: O then thrice happy and industrious paire, That both the depth and height of Musique found. Which my sweet Friend, the life of Lovers pens, In so milde manner hath attain'd to do, He looks the better, and his hearers too; So in exchange all Ladies are his friends. And when our Meditations are too meane To keep their raptures longer on the wing, They soar'd up to that Prophet and that King, Whose Love is God, and Heav'n his glorious Scene: Setting his Psalmes, whereby both they and we May singing rise to immortalitie. A. Tounshend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Doubtful Poems. XIX. Mr. Townsends Verses to Ben Johnsons, in answer to an Abusive Copie, crying down his Magnetick Lady.The attribution of this poem is questionable. It cannot move thy friend (firm Ben) that he Whom the Star-Chamber censur'd, rimes at thee. I gratulate the method of thy fate, That joyn'd thee next in malice to the State. So Nero, after paricidall guilt, Brooks no delay till Lucan's blood be spilt; Nor could his malice find a second crime, Unlesse he slew the Poet of the time. But (thanks to Hellicon) here are no blowes; This Drone no more of sting then honey shewes. His verses shall be counted Censure, when Cast Malefactors are made Jury-men. Mean while rejoyce, that so disgrac't a quill 'Tempted to wound that worth, time cannot kill. And thou that darest to blast Fame fully blown, Lye buried in the ruines of thy owne. Vexe not thine ashes, open not the deep, The Ghosts of thy slaine name had rather sleep. XX. [Amyntas, ho! Didst thou espy, today]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Daphnis. Amyntas. D. Amyntas, ho! Didst thou espy, today, A mountain-Nymph pass nimbly by this way? Her Garments handsom were, though nothing brave: Her Cheek and Eye, such as thy Phyllis have. A. Daphnis, to RoÃ«ll house early she went, To her brave Lord, some Token to present. D. Amyntas, Thanks: No better newes I'd hear: I know, she'l find a noble welcom there. Tounsend. XXI. La Boiuinette.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Shee's not the fairest of her name, And yet she conquers more then all her race. She has other motiues to Inflame, Besides a louely face; She has witt &amp; Constancy, Charmes that take the Soule more then the Eye Tis not Euery Louer Knows how to discouer Such Diuinity. And yet She is an Easie booke, Writt in faire Language for the meaner witt, A stately Garbe, a Glorious looke, And all things justly fitt. Yet time shall undermine That glorious outside that appeares soe fine. When the Common louer Shrinkes and giues her ouer, Then Shee's only mine. To the Platonik that Apply's His deare addresses only to the mind, The bodie but a Temple signifies, Wherein the Saint's inshrin'd. To him it is all one, Whether the walls be marble or of stone; For in holy places, Which old time defaces, There's most deuotion shewne. XXII. Upon kinde and true Love.The attribution of this poem is questionable. 'Tis not how witty, nor how free, Nor yet how beautifull she be, But how much kinde and true to me. Freedome and Wit none can confine, And Beauty like the Sun doth shine, But kinde and true are onely mine. Let others with attention sit, To listen, and admire her wit, That is a rock where Ile not split. Let others dote upon her eyes, And burn their hearts for sacrifice, Beauty's a calm where danger lyes. But Kinde and True have been long tried A harbour where we may confide, And safely there at anchor ride. From change of winds there we are free, And need not feare Storme's tyrannie, Nor Pirat, though a Prince he be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ALBIONS TRIVMPH. PERSONATED IN A Maske at Court. By the Kings Maiestie and his Lords. The Sunday after Twelfe Night. 1631. The first Song. [Behold! I come not from above] Behold! I come not from above, To hyde, or hunt out wanton Love, Or doe what Man can doe: But to spred all my nimble wings, And like a God, doe Godlike things Gratefull, and Gratious too. Obserue! But see ye be not nyce, Prepare to give, and take advice, As wise-Men ought to doe: Lest when your subtile witts haue done, Your Notes, like Motes, thought in the Sunne Proove farre beneath vs too. Admyre! but censure not their Powers, That sinke not with Times sandy howres, As mortall Creatures doe. And since the Shaft that is adrest, At Heaven may hurt the Shooters breast, Be pleas'd and please vs too. The first Chorus. [Happy, thrice happy is that houre] Happy, thrice happy is that houre Wherein a God descends, Eyther in person, or in powre And Mans poore state befriends. The second Song. [Olimpian IOVE to the bright ALBA sends] Olimpian IOVE to the bright ALBA sends No vulgar God to beare his deare Commends. And with pure eyes, and a paternall hand, This Vniverse having survey'd, and span'd, In Councell with himselfe, he hath decreed, From fayre ALBIPOLIS shall soone proceede A Triumph: Mighty, as the Man design'd To weare those Bayes; Heroicke, as his mind; Iust, as his actions; Glorious, as his Reigne. And like his Vertues, Infinite in Treyne. Th'Immortall Swannes, contending for his Name, Shall beare it singing, to the House of Fame. And though at distance yet High IOVE is pleas'd Your laboring eyes shall with his sight be eas'd. This from a God, vnto a Goddesse sent, A God Relates, that could vse Complement: But when such States, negotiate by such meanes We speake in Acts, and scorne words trifling Scenes. The second Chorus. [Ye Powers Divine make roome, prepare a Seate] Ye Powers Divine make roome, prepare a Seate On the Northside, for ALBANACT the Great, Earth is not fruitlesse: nor your nombers full, Ther's One to come will make some Starrs looke dull. The third Song. [What mak's me so vnnimbly ryse] MERCVRY. What mak's me so vnnimbly ryse, That did descend so fleete? There is no vp-hill in the skyes; Clouds stay not feathered feete. CHORVS. Thy wings are sing'd: and thou canst fly But slowly now, swift MERCVRY. MERCVRY. Some Lady heere, is sure too blame That from Loves starry skyes, Hath shot some Beame, or sent some flame, Like Lightning, from her Eyes. CHORVS. Taxe not the Starrs, with what the Sunne, Too neere aproch't (insens't) hath done. MERCVRY. I'le rowle me in Auroras Dew, Or lye in Tethis bed; Or from coole Iris begge a few, Pure Opale shewrs new shed. CHORVS. Nor Dew, nor shewers, nor sea can slake Thy quenchlesse heate, but Lethes lake. The Dialogue betweene Cvpid and Diana. Cvpid. Sit not secure, nor thinke in ease Still vndispleas'd, your selues to please: Diana, Chast Diana stoope, And helpe to wound this warlike troope. Diana. Wants Love a Bowe, or shaft of mine? This suit will make my Crescent shine. Cvpid. Love is grown wise, and meanes to bring To his smart Bowe, a double string. Behold our Marke? taks't thou not pride In such a Glory to devide? Diana. I doe, I doe, since I am sure, When we two ioyne, our flames are pure. Cvpid and Diana. As pure, and Cleere, as Albas skin, As her faire Fame, or thoughts within: Pure as my selfe; nay pure like Thee, Now Love is that which Love should be. The Chorus below sing. [Bow-bearing Gods, shoote, shoote, and hit] Bow-bearing Gods, shoote, shoote, and hit, And make our Caesar greater yet: Yet leave him with vs, Let him shine Still heere; And make him all Devine The fourth Song. [Ye Worthies of this Ile] Ye Worthies of this Ile, That led by your brave Chiefe, In an Heroick style, Have over done Beliefe: Subdu'd by ALBAS eyes Come downe, Loves Sacrifice! It is no shame to yeild, Where t'is in veyne to strive: The Gods would quit the field, Should they these warres revive Or Conquerd, by her Eyes, Come downe Loves Sacrifice. Streight Cedar, that hast stood, The shock of many a wind: The top of this Tall wood, By a high hand design'd Subdu'd by ALBAS Eyes, Come downe Loves Sacrifice! The fift Song. [Great ALBA though eche Grande heere] Great ALBA though eche Grande heere, At this High Court of thine, Like a true Liege Man doth appeere, And offers at thy Shryne: It is no Conquest for thine Eyes, When petty-Princes fall, That are some single Beauties pryse, Or a lone-Vertues Thrall: Heere comes the Trophe of thy prayse, The Monarch of these Iles, The Mirror of thy Cheerefull Rayes, And Glory of thy Smyles: The Vertues and the Graces all, Must meete in one, when such Starrs fall. The sixth Song sung by the five Deities. [Bles't Payre whose prayers like Incence rise] Bles't Payre whose prayers like Incence rise, Opening, and pulling downe the Skies Take your Reward! Iust as yee mett, So hand in hand live many a Day, And may your Vertuous minds beget Issue that never shall decay, And so be fruitfull every way. May Plenty Proteus-like appeare, Varying your Pleasures every yeare. Wee five come freely to impart, Such favors as we can afforde: One gives his Concord. Hand, the next his Affection to the Countrey. Heart, The third her Inocence. Robe, the fourth her Iustice. Sword, The fifth full many a Religion. Suppliant Word. And to fulfill your future Blisse, Sweete Peace salutes you with a Kisse. Peace Sings alone the seventh Song. [Frighted by Day; And in the Night diseas'd] Frighted by Day; And in the Night diseas'd, I fled to Heaven, and left the World displeas'd. Fond Men that strive more for a Province there, Then looking vpward to possesse a Sphere. Yet vanquish't and Victorious, both at last, Their weary Limmes, on my soft Bed would cast. The Five. [Lyons, and Lambs togeather lye] Two 2 Lyons, and Lambs togeather lye, When Lovly Peace stands smiling by Two 2 Temples and Townes by thy stay'd hand, First learne to Rise, And then to Stand. All 5 'Tis not the Laurel Tree that brings, Anointing Oyle for sacred Kings: Those Princes see the happiest Dayes, Whose Olive Branches stand for Bayes. The eighth Song. [Armes are layd by: Earely and late] Armes are layd by: Earely and late, The Traueller goes safe to Bed: Men eate and Drinke in Massie Plate, And are with Deinties dayly fed. Why should this Ile aboue the rest, Be made (great Gods) the Halcions nest? The 5. Deities thus resolue them. Imperious Peace her selfe Descends The foure Gods. Then here our search, and wonder ends, Wee'l steale away Peace. Earths Rulers, stay! The foure Gods. Doth soft Peace call? Peace. Yes: and will streight employ yee All. The foure Gods How, and wherein? The 5. in the lower Clowde. Give eare, your Charge doth now begin. Peace gives them their Charge. Neptune to Sea, And let no Sayle, Meete Albions Fleete, But make it veile. Bellona Arme, That Foes may see, Their Lillies kept by Lyons be. Their fruitfull fields (Cebele) make Pay Centuple for all they take. And let Both Indies (Pluto) meete, And lay their wealth at ALBAS feete. The foure Gods reply When Peace commands such pleasing things, From Love and Time wee'l steale their wings. The last generall Chorus. [Loaden with Wealth and Honor may] Loaden with Wealth and Honor may, These Gods returne to crowne this Day, And Mary-Charles whose mindes within, And Bodyes make but Hymens Twin, Long live they so, And Brest, to Brest, May Angels sing them to their Rest.</field>

Was I a Lyon! that am now afraid! I feare no danger; nor I feare no Death; But to be Retransform'd, into a Beast: Which while I was, although I must confesse, I was the Brauest: What could shee doe lesse, That saw me Subiect, to no base desire: Yet was there in me, a Promethean fire, That made me covet to be man againe, Govern'd by Reason, and not rul'd by Sense. Therefore I shunne this place of Residence, And flye to Vertue: in whose awfull sight, She dares not come, but in a Maske, and crouch, As low as I did, for my liberty. Her Bowre is pleasant, and her Palace Rich; Her Fare Delicious, and her Language fine; But shall the Soule, the Minion of the Gods, Stoope to her Vassalls? Or stand by and sterue, While they sit swelling, in her Chayre of State? Tis not her Rod, her Philters, nor her Herbes, (Though strong in Magicke) that can bound mens minds; And make them Prisoners, where there is no wall. It is consent that makes a perfect Slaue: And Sloth that binds us to Lusts easie Trades, Wherein we serue out our youths Prentiship, Thinking at last, Loue should enfranchize vs, Whome we haue neuer, either seru'd or knowne: âHe finds no helpe, that vses not his owne. The Song of Circe, represented by Madam Coniacke. Cir: Dissembling Traytor, now I see the cause, Of all thy fawning, was but to be free: Twas not fornothing, thou hadst teeth and clawes, For thou hast made a cruell prey of me. Her 4 Nymphes. Ingratitude is apt, to slinke away, And shunne that bounty, which it cannot pay. Circe: And he is gone (aye me) is stolne from hence, And this poore Casket of my breast, hath left Without a Hart: that should for recompence, Haue lockt in two: O most inhumane theft! Her foure Nymphes. Send not your sighes, after a fickle mind, That Sayles the faster for such Gales of wind. Circe. Then take my keyes! and shew me al my wealth. Leade me abroad! Let me my subiects view! Bring me some Physick! though that bring no health! And feyne me pleasures, since I finde none true. Chorus. Yee willing Servants! And ye Soules confin'd To severall shapes, by powerfull Herbes and Art, Appeare, transform'd each in your seuerall kind, And striue to temper the distemper'd Heart, Of sullen Circe, stung with Cupids dart. Harmony presented by M??? Shep. Not as my selfe, but as the brightest Starre, That shines in Heaven, come to Reigne this day And these the Beames and Influences are Of Constellations, whose Planeticke sway, Though some foresee, all must alike obey. Chorus. Such a Coniunction, of auspicious lights, Meete but in Honor, of some Regall rights. Harmony and her Quire. Ladies! lend vs your eares. And let no Louers sigh be heard!

When Divine Beautie, will vouchsafe to stoope, And moue to Earth: 'tis fit the Heauenly Spheres, Should be her Musicke: And the Starrie Troope, Shine round about her, like the Crowne she weares. Chorus. No mortall Brest, Can entertaine: So great a Guest, And such a Trayne. Highest Sphere. I cannot blame ye if ye gaze, And giue small eare to what I say: For such a presence will amaze, And send the Senses all one way. Chorus. The Musick that yee heare, is dull, But that ye see, is sweete indeed: In euery Part exact, and full, From whence there doth an Ayre proceed, On which th'Intelligences feed, Where faire and good, inseparably conioynd, Create a Cupid, that is neuer blind. The Song. [How rich is earth? and poore the skies?] Harmony. How rich is earth? and poore the skies? Depriu'd of heauenly Beauties eyes? Whose Image men adore. The eighth Sphere. Heroicke Vertue, is that kind Of Beautie, that attracts the mind, And men should most implore. The rest of the Spheres. Ianus was happy that could see, Two wayes at once: And happier he That round about him kept Watches, that neuer slept. Cho: But we most happy, that behold, Two that haue turn'd this age to Gold, Making old Saturns Reigne, In theirs, come backe againe. And since more, th'obiect, then the sight, Makes' eche spectator Blest; How are we rauisht with delight, That see the best. [It is but Iustice, to torment a heart] Cupid: It is but Iustice, to torment a heart, That tortured thousands: And my gentle reigne, So wrongd with acting of a Tyrants part, I must Restreyne, My powre abus'd; And right my iniurd Treyne. Iupiter. Thou claim'st her Subiects: And I claime the Soyle, As Soueraigne Lord: The Hecatomes shee brings, Though great Oblations, yet deduc'd from Spoyle, Are sordid Things: And sent of Earth: Vertue pure Incense brings. Circe: The Gods, more freedome did allow, when Ioue turn'd Io to a Cow. Pallas: Are mortall Creatures, growne so proud To taxe the Skye, for euery Cloud: Circe: Man-Maide, bee gone!
