      <field name="fulltext">SONNET. [ONCE more, my Hawkins, I attempt to raise] ONCE more, my Hawkins, I attempt to raise My feeble voice to urge the tuneful song Of that sweet Muse, which to her Country's wrong Or sleeps, or only wakes to Latian lays. Great is the Merit, well-deserv'd the praise Of that last Work, where Reasoning just and strong In charming verse thy name shall bear along To learned foreigners, and future days: Yet do not thou thy native language scorn, In which great Shakespear, Spenser, Milton sang Such strains as may with Greek, or Roman vie: This cultivate, raise, polish, and adorn; So each fair Maid shall on thy numbers hang, And every Briton bless thy melody. Thomas Edwards. ON DESIGN AND BEAUTY. AN EPISTLE. Highmore, you grant, that in the painter's art, Though perspective and colours claim a part, Yet, the more noble skill and more divine, Are proper Characters and just Design; Design, that particle of heavenly flame, Soul of all Beauty, through all Arts the same. This to the stately dome its grandeur gives, Strikes in the picture, in the statue lives; Persuades in Tully's, or in Talbot's tongue; And tunes the lyre, and builds the lofty song. The love of Order, sure from Nature springs, Our taste adapted to the frame of things: Nature the pow'rs of harmony displays, And Truth and Order animate the mass. Who that this ample theatre beholds, Where fair Proportion all her charms unfolds; This sun, and these the stars that roll above, Measuring alternate seasons as they move; Who, but admires a fabric so compleat; And from admiring, aims to imitate? Hence various Arts proceed; for human wit But imitates the plan by Nature set; Truth of Design, which Nature's works impart, Alike extends to every work of Art, To compass this, both skill and genius meet, Genius to bring materials, skill to fit; Where both conspire, is Beauty; which depends On the fair aptitude of means to ends: Parts corresponding, if devoid of this, Are affectation all and emptiness. If Cloacina's cell with cumbrous state Appear superb, and as a palace great, We laugh at the superfluous pomp, unfit, As Cibber's odes to Handel's music set. Reverse of this, the true Sublime attains The noblest purpose by the simplest means; More perfect, as more wide its branches shoot, While all are nourish'd by one common root. And such, if man Immensity could pierce, Such are the beauties of the Universe; The various movements of this great machine All are directed by one Pow'r within; One Genius, as in human frame the Soul, Rules, and pervades, and animates the Whole. Alike on Art Simplicity bestows An awful stillness and sublime repose; Great without pomp, and finish'd without toil; Such as the plans of Angelo or Boyle. Yet here, unless due boundaries be plac'd, Oft will the Simple spread into the Vast; Vast, where the symmetry of parts a-kin Lies too remote, and is but dimly seen. In Nature's wondrous frame if ought appear Vast, or mishapen, or irregular, 'Tis, that the mighty structure was design'd A Whole proportion'd to the all-seeing Mind. But Art is bounded by perception still, And aims not to oppress the mind, but fill. All beyond this are like his project vain, Who meant to form mount Athos into man. Nor less their fault, who shunning this extreme Grow circumstantial, and but croud the scheme. Beauty, when best discern'd, is most compleat, But all is Gothic which is intricate: Conformity of parts, if too minute, Is lost, before the senses trace it out; And contrasts which in modern style abound, Sever ideas, till they quite confound; Fops are distinguish'd by this little taste, But if a genius err, his error is the Vast. On trifles ne'er let Art her strength exhaust, There is a littleness in lavish cost: Who read thee, Swift, so frugal is thy skill, Think they supply, when they but comment still. True elegance appears with mild restraint, Decent, discreet, and proper, yet not quaint. Some works are made too accurate to please; But graceful those, that seem perform'd with ease: It profits oft to play the careless part, As tumblers trip but to conceal their Art; Nature alone can move: the pow'rs of wit Her shape assuming, charm but while they cheat. Be thou not formal, yet with method free; Sole fountain this, of perspicuity: 'Tis lucid Order will the parts unite, Like parts to like, opposing opposite. In sound, 'tis Harmony that charms the ear, Yet discords intermingled here and there, Still make the sweet similitude appear. Each by its opposite a lustre gains, As hills the vales assist, and woods the plains; Grateful variety! so fair Design Loves to distinguish where it cannot join; Yet then, to Truth and Nature ever just, Nor joins, nor separates, but when it must. Fondly some authors deck the dainty piece With false resemblance, false antithesis; Fantastic apes of Beauty, who beget Romance in science, quaint conceits in wit; Such phantoms, when we think the substance near, Mock our embrace, and vanish into air. Of all, which late posterity will own, Truth is the basis, lasting Truth alone. For what can symmetry of parts avail, T'uphold a building, of materials frail? To reach perfection then, whoe'er aspires, Extent of knowledge adds to native fires. He, not content the shallow shore to keep, Dauntless expatiates in the boundless deep, Ranging through earth, and air, and sea, and sky, Where'er the scatter'd seeds of Beauty lye; Surveys all Nature, and together brings The wide-dispers'd dependency of things. Hence those enlarg'd ideas which impart The common sympathies of Art with Art; Hence Order built on Order seems to rise A comely series, till it touch the skies. At length when searching thought, and ceaseless toil, Have gather'd and secur'd the noble spoil; Well may the learned Artist then Design, His fancy teeming, fraught his magazine; Thence draw materials, next, in order range, Compare, distinguish, raise, diminish, change, Aggroupe the figures here, and there oppose, To these a lustre give, a shade to those: Till each with each consenting form a Whole, Firm as a phalanx, as a concert, full. Such charms the pow'rs of symmetry dispense, Bright Emanation of Intelligence! From Mind alone delightful Order springs, She tempers and adjusts the mass of things; From darkness calls forth light, design from chance, And bids each atom into form advance. But if the workmanship of Mind appear So lovely to behold, Herself how fair! Thus though in Nature endless beauties shine, Loveliest she seems, in human face divine; Her other works a calm delight impart, Those charm the genius, this allures the heart: Can outward form the tender passion move, A lifeless statue, wake the soul to love? 'Tis not exteriour Harmony we call Beauty, or sure such Beauty means not all; But something more exalted, more refin'd; Beauty that warms, is Harmony of Mind; Height'ning each air, improving ev'ry grace, The Mind looks out and lightens in the face: And when the Mind informs a lovely mein, Herself more lovely, then, is Beauty seen Attractive, and shines forth apparent Queen. How sweet the task! these lineaments to trace, And each in lively portraiture express! Such, Highmore, thine; thy comprehensive draught To the fair outside joins the charms of thought. Search then Perfection, Beauty search, around Through all her forms, fairest in Virtue found. Else could the memory of each ancient sage, Themselves unknown, delight a distant age? Ancients, who life enrich'd with Arts, and Laws; Or fell, or conquer'd, in their country's cause: What shrines, what altars to their ashes rear'd, As heroes honour'd, and as Gods rever'd; And Godlike They, whose virtues unconfin'd Bless latest times, and dignify mankind; Not with low duties fill a private space, But are the guardian pow'rs of human race. Virtue, the more diffus'd, the fairer shows; Fairest, That only which no limits knows, Hail sov'reign Good! unmixt, unfading Good! Beauty, whose essence fills infinitude! Whate'er of fair and excellent is found Through earth, through heav'n, above, beneath, around, All that in Art, and Nature can invite, Are but faint beamings of thy perfect light. Bear me some God to groves of Academe! There, let eternal Wisdom be my theme. Or Thou, whom erst by contemplation led Plato discover'd in the silent shade, Urania! thee, the Sire delighted view'd, Holy, divine, pure, amiable and good. They too, thy sweet attractive influence feel, They chiefly, who in liberal Arts excel; Scorning delights that lull the vulgar throng, The cups of Circe and the Siren's song; Nor less th'allurements of wealth, honours, pow'r, The gaze of fools, the pageant of an hour; They, from irradiance of thy genial beam Prolific, with immortal offspring teem. Such Poets once, while Deity possest With sacred fires the muse-enamour'd breast; Divine enthusiasts! born in happier times, E'er Gothic laws prevail'd, and servile rhimes; Now, quaint expression, or an easy line, Is all the claim to PhÅbus and the Nine. Not so the Attic hive, and bards of Rome; Ranging industrious they, from Nature's bloom Gather'd variety of sweets, and thence Distill'd a pure Ã¦therial quintessence, Hence the fair fictions of the Muse excel What sages dictate, or historians tell; With living lessons, rules unmixt and pure Her aim to teach, and teaching, to allure. All Arts their tribute bring, her numbers move Harmonious, as angelic choirs above; Immortal colours in her pictures glow; Her speech the rhetoric of the Gods below. True Poets are themselves a Poem, each A pattern of the lovely rules they teach; Those fair ideas that their fancy charm, Inspire their lives, and every action warm; And when they chaunt the praise of high desert, They but transcribe the dictates of their heart. Thus is Apollo's laureat priest endow'd, Himself a temple worthy of the God. Such, Homer, Solon, Phineus are enroll'd; Sages, and lawgivers, and prophets old: All Poets, all inspir'd; an awful train, Seated on Pindus' head, apart from the profane. A LETTER FROM A CAPTAIN IN COUNTRY QUARTERS TO HIS CORINNA IN TOWN. My earliest flame, to whom I owe All that a Captain needs to know; Dress, and quadrille, and air, and chat, Lewd songs, loud laughter, and all that; Arts that have widows oft subdued, And never fail'd to win a prude; Think, charmer, how I live forlorn At quarters, from Corinna torn. When thou, my fair one, art away, How shall I kill that foe, the day? The landed 'squire, and dull freeholder, Are sure no comrades for a soldier; To drink with parsons all day long, Misaubin tells me wou'd be wrong: And nunn'ry tales, and Curl's Dutch whore I've read, 'till I can read no more. At noon I rise, and strait alarm The semptress' shop, or country farm; Repuls'd, my next pursuit is a'ter The parson's wife, or landlord's daughter: Oft at the ball for game I search, At market oft, sometimes at church, And plight my faith and gold to boot; Yet demme if a soul will do'tâ In short our credit's sunk so low, Since troops were kept o'foot for shew, All that for soldiers once run mad, Are now turn'd Patriots, egad! And when I boast my feats, the shrew Asks who was slain the last review. Know then, that I and captain Trueman Resolve to keep a missâin common: Not her, among the batter'd lasses, Such as our friend ToupÃ©t caresses, But her, a nymph of polish'd sense, Which pedants call impertinence; Train'd up to laugh, and drink, and swear, And railly with the prettiest airâ Come dimpled smiles, and stealing sighs, The lisp, the luscious extasies, The sideling glance, the feeble trip, The head inclined, the pouting lip Come, deckt in colours, which may vie With Iris, when she paints the sky. Amidst our frolicks and carouses How shall we pity wretched spouses! But where can this dear soul be found, In garret high, or under ground? If so divine a fair there be, Charming Corinna, thou art she. But oh! what motives can persuade Belles, to prefer a rural shade, In this gay month, when pleasures bloom, The park, the playâthe drawing roomâ Lo! birthnights upon birthnights tread, Term is begun, the lawyer fee'd; My friend the merchant, let me tell ye, Calls in his way to Farinelli; What if my sattin gown and watch Some unfledg'd booby 'squire may catch, Who, charm'd with his delicious quarry, May first debauch me, and then marry? Never was season more befitting Since convocations last were sitting. And shall I leave dear Charing-cross, And let two boys my charms ingross? Leave temple, play-house, rose and rummer, A country friend might serve in summer! The town's your choiceâyet, charming fair, Observe what ills attend you there. Captains, that once admir'd your beauty, Are kept by quality onâduty; Cits, half a crown for alms disburse, From templars look for something worse: My lord may take you to his bed, But then he sends you back unpaid; And all you gain from generous cully, Must go to keep some Irish bully. Pinchbeck demands the tweezer case, And Monmouth-street the gown and stays; More mischiefs yet come crowding on, Bridewell,âWest-Indiesâand Sir Johnâ Then oh! to lewdness bid adieu, And chastly live, confin'd to two. AN EPITAPH. IN IMITATION OF DRYDEN. Under this marble stone intomb'd are laid The precious relicts of a pious Maid, A Form too lovely to be snatch'd away, A Mind too good to make a longer stay; So many Virtues to that Form were giv'n, Nature mistook, and made her first for heav'n; Or else 'twas Chance, and from the mould'ring frame Leapt out a Goddess, what was meant a Dame; Th'impression of a lucky hit she bore, Nature ne'er made a Masterpiece before; And then, Oh! ever jealous of our joy, Blest us to curse, and made her to destroy. Had she not liv'd, the world had never known, What various talents might unite in one; And, Oh! sad trial, had she never died, Her sex had wanted Virtues to divide. A PIPE OF TOBACCO: IN IMITATION OF SIX SEVERAL AUTHORS. IMITATION I. A NEW-YEAR's ODE. Laudes egregii CÃ¦saris ? CulpÃ¢ deterere ingenÃ®. Hor. RECITATIVE. Old battle-array, big with horror is fled, And olive-rob'd peace again lifts up her head, Sing, ye Muses, Tobacco, the blessing of peace; Was ever a nation so blessed as this? AIR. When summer suns grow red with heat, Tobacco tempers PhÅbus' ire, When wintry storms around us beat, Tobacco chears with gentle fire. Yellow autumn, youthful spring, In thy praises jointly sing. RECITATIVO. Like Neptune, CÃ¦sar guards Virginian fleets, Fraught with Tobacco's balmy sweets; Old Ocean trembles at Britannia's pow'r, And Boreas is afraid to roar. AIR. Happy mortal! he who knows Pleasure which a Pipe bestows; Curling eddies climb the room, Wafting round a mild perfume. RECITATIVO. Let foreign climes the vine and orange boast, While wastes of war deform the teeming coast; Britannia, distant from each hostile sound, Enjoys a Pipe, with ease and freedom crown'd; E'en restless Faction finds itself most free, Or if a slave, a slave to Liberty. AIR. Smiling years that gayly run, Round the Zodiack with the sun, Tell, if ever you have seen Realms so quiet and serene. Britain's sons no longer now Hurl the bar, or twang the bow, Nor of crimson combat think, But securely smoke and drink. CHORUS. Smiling years that gayly run Round the Zodiack with the sun, Tell, if ever you have seen Realms so quiet and serene. IMITATION II. Tenues fugit ceu fumus in auras. Virg. Little tube of mighty pow'r, Charmer of an idle hour, Object of my warm desire, Lip of wax, and eye of fire: And thy snowy taper waist, With my finger gently brac'd; And thy pretty swelling crest, With my little stopper prest, And the sweetest bliss of blisses, Breathing from thy balmy kisses. Happy thrice, and thrice agen, Happiest he of happy men; Who when agen the night returns, When agen the taper burns; When agen the cricket's gay, (Little cricket, full of play) Can afford his tube to feed With the fragrant Indian weed: Pleasure for a nose divine, Incense of the god of wine. Happy thrice, and thrice agen, Happiest he of happy men. IMITATION III. ? Prorumpit ad Ã¦thera nubem Turbine fumantem piceo. Virg. O thou, matur'd by glad Hesperian suns, Tobacco, fountain pure of limpid truth, That looks the very soul; whence pouring thought Swarms all the mind; absorpt is yellow care, And at each puff imagination burns. Flash on thy bard, and with exalting fires Touch the mysterious lip, that chaunts thy praise In strains to mortal sons of earth unknown. Behold an engine, wrought from tawny mines Of ductile clay, with plastic virtue form'd, And glaz'd magnifick o'er, I grasp, I fill. From PÃ¦totheke with pungent pow'rs perfum'd, Itself one tortoise all, where shines imbib'd Each parent ray; then rudely ram'd illume, With the red touch of zeal-enkindling sheet, Mark'd with Gibsonian lore; forth issue clouds, Thought-thrilling, thirst-inciting clouds around, And many-mining fires: I all the while, Lolling at ease, inhale the breezy balm. But chief, when Bacchus wont with thee to join In genial strife and orthodoxal ale, Stream life and joy into the Muses bowl. Oh be thou still my great inspirer, thou My Muse; oh fan me with thy zephyrs boon, While I, in clouded tabernacle shrin'd, Burst forth all oracle and mystick song. IMITATION IV. ? Bullatis mihi nugis, Pagina turgescat, dare pondus idonea fumo. Pers. Criticks avaunt; Tobacco is my theme; Tremble like hornets at the blasting steam, And you, court-insects, flutter not too near Its light, nor buzz within the scorching sphere, Pollio, with flame like thine, my verse inspire, So shall the Muse from smoke elicit fire. Coxcombs prefer the tickling sting of snuff; Yet all their claim to wisdom isâa puff: Lord Foplin smokes notâfor his teeth afraid: Sir Tawdry smokes notâfor he wears brocade. Ladies, when pipes are brought, affect to swoon; They love no smoke, except the smoke of town; But courtiers hate the puffing tribe,âno matter, Strange if they love the breath that cannot flatter! Its foes but shew their ignorance; can he Who scorns the leaf of knowledge, love the tree? The tainted templar (more prodigious yet) Rails at Tobacco, tho' it makes himâspit. Citronia vows it has an odious stink; She will not smoke (ye gods!) but she will drink: And chaste Prudella (blame her if you can) Says, pipes are us'd by that vile creature Man: Yet crouds remain, who still its worth proclaim, While some for pleasure smoke, and some for fame: Fame, of our actions universal spring, For which we drink, eat, sleep, smoke,âev'ry thing. IMITATION V. ? Solis ad ortus Vanescit fumus. Lucan. Blest leaf! whose aromatick gales dispense To templars modesty, to parsons sense: So raptur'd priests, at fam'd Dodona's shrine Drank inspiration from the steam divine. Poison that cures, a vapour that affords Content, more solid than the smile of lords: Rest to the weary, to the hungry food, The last kind refuge of the Wise and Good. Inspir'd by thee, dull cits adjust the scale Of Europe's peace, when other statesmen fail. By thee protected, and thy sister, beer, Poets rejoice, nor think the bailiff near. Nor less the critick owns thy genial aid, While supperless he plies the piddling trade. What tho' to love and softs delights a foe, By ladies hated, hated by the beau, Yet social freedom, long to courts unknown, Fair health, fair truth, and virtue are thy own, Come to thy poet, come with healing wings, And let me taste thee unexcis'd by kings. IMITATION VI. Ex fumo dare lucem. Hor. Boy! bring an ounce of Freeman's best, And bid the vicar be my guest: Let all be plac'd in manner due, A pot wherein to spit or spue, And London Journal, and Free Briton, Of use to light a pipe or This village, unmolested yet By troopers, shall be my retreat: Who cannot flatter, bribe, betray; Who cannot write or vote for ?. Far from the vermin of the town, Here let me rather live, my own, Doze o'er a pipe, whose vapour bland In sweet oblivion lulls the land; Of all which at Vienna passes, As ignorant as ? Brass is: And scorning rascals to caress, Extol the days of good Queen Bess, When first Tobacco blest our isle, Then think of other Queensâand smile. Come jovial pipe, and bring along Midnight revelry and song; The merry catch, the madrigal, That echoes sweet in City Hall; The parson's pun, the smutty tale Of country justice o'er his ale. I ask not what the French are doing, Or Spain to compass Britain's ruin: Britons, if undone, can go, Where Tobacco loves to grow. THE FIRE SIDE: A PASTORAL SOLILOQUY. Hic Secretum iter et fallentis semita vitÃ¦. HOR. Thrice happy, who free from ambition and pride, In a rural retreat, has a quiet fire side; I love my fire side, there I long to repair; And to drink a delightful oblivion of care. Oh! when shall I 'scape to be truly my own, From the noise, and the smoke, and the bustle of town. Then I live, then I triumph, whene'er I retire From the pomp and parade that the Many admire. Hail ye woods and ye lawns, shady vales, sunny hills' And the warble of birds, and the murmur of rills, Ye flow'rs of all hues that embroider the ground, Flocks feeding, or frisking in gambols around; Scene of joy to behold! joy, that who would forego, For the wealth and the pow'r that a court can bestow? I have said it at home, I have said it abroad, That the town is Man's world, but that this is of God; Here my trees cannot flatter, plants nurs'd by my care Pay with fruit or with fragrance, and incense the air; Here contemplative solitude raises the mind, (Least alone, when alone,) to ideas refin'd. Methinks hid in groves, that no sound can invade, Save when Philomel strikes up her sweet serenade, I revolve on the changes and chances of things, And pity the wretch that depends upon kings. Now I pass with old authors an indolent hour, And reclining at ease turn Demosthenes o'er. Now facetious and vacant, I urge the gay flask With a set of old friendsâwho have nothing to ask; Thus happy, I reck not of France nor of Spain, Nor the balance of power what hand shall sustain. The balance of pow'r? Ah! till that is restor'd, What solid delight can retirement afford? Some must be content to be drudges of state, That the Sage may securely enjoy his retreat. In weather serene, when the ocean is calm, It matters not much who presides at the helm; But soon as clouds gather and tempests arise, Then a pilot there needs, a man dauntless and wise. If such can be found, sure He ought to come forth And lend to the publick His talents and worth. Whate'er inclination or ease may suggest, If the state wants his aid, he has no claim to rest; But who is the Man, a bad game to redeem? He whom Turin admires, who has Prussia's esteem, Whom the Spaniard has felt; and whose iron with dread Haughty Lewis saw forging to fall on his head. Holland loves him, nor less in the North all the pow'rs Court, honour, revere, and the Empress adores. Hark! what was that sound? for it seem'd more sublime Than befits the low genius of pastoral rhyme: Was it Wisdom I heard? or can fumes of the brain Cheat my ears with a dream? Ha! repeat me that strain: Yes, Wisdom, I hear thee; thou deign'st to declare Me, Me, the sole Atlas to prop this whole sphere: Thy voice says, or seems in sweet accents to say, Haste to save sinking Britain;âresign'd I obey; And O! witness ye Powers, that ambition and pride Have no share in this changeâFor I love my Fire Side. Thus the Shepherd; then throwing his crook away steals Direct to St. J?s's and takes up the S?s. HORACE, ODE XIV. BOOK I. IMITATED IN MDCCXLVI. O ship! shall new waves again bear thee to sea? Where, alas! art thou driving? keep steady to shore; Thy sides are left without an oar, And thy shaken mast groans, to rude tempests a prey. Thy tackle all torn, can no longer endure The assaults of the surge that now triumphs and reigns, None of thy sails entire remains, Nor a God to protect in another sad hour. Tho' thy outside bespeaks thee of noble descent, The forest's chief pride, yet thy race and thy fame, What are they but an empty name? Wise mariners trust not to gilding and paint. Beware then lest Thou float, uncertain again, The sport of wild winds, late my sorrowful care, And now my fondest wish, beware Of the changeable shoals where the Rhine meets the Main. ON PHÅBE. Though PhÅbe's lovely charms excel All that is charming in a Belle; Yet she, regardless of her face, Scarce owns her image in the glass, She knows, that she alone can find Her likeness in a lovely mind, Sees more exalted Beauty there, Beauty, that lasts for ever fair; Discretion, innocence, and truth, Still flourish in unfading youth, Bloom through the winter of our days, And thrive, when outward form decays. PhÅbe thus arm'd, the pow'r she gains Secures, and, where she conquers, reigns. Beaux may be caught with outward show, And Belles will flutter at a Beau, The wise are only charm'd to find Good nature, wit, and judgment join'd With each perfection of a beauteous mind. ON THE SAME [ON PHÅBE]. O early plant of tender years, Beauty that blooms at once, and bears! Discretion mixt with sprightly wit, And innocence with taste polite, A chearful, yet discerning mind, And dignity with softness join'd; While these assembled charms are seen All in the compass of fifteen, Maturer age abash'd declares, Wisdom is not the growth of years: No, 'tis a ray that darts from heav'n, Perfection is not taught, but giv'n. Let others by degrees advance, 'Till folly ripen into sense; PhÅbe consummate from her birth In artless charms, and native worth, Has all the virtues years enjoy, With all the graces they destroy. TO SOME LADIES, WHO SAID THE AUTHOR LOVED CHICKEN. Prudes, forbear your scandal-picking, Own that PhÅbe is no Chicken; If maturity be measur'd By the virtues, that are treasur'd, She at fifteen can reckon more Than you can boast of at threescore; And while your passion, taste, and skill, Is dress, and scandal, and quadrille, 'Tis Her's, with books and arts refin'd, To dress and cultivate the mind, In easy converse to delight, A foe to calumny and spight; In cards and follies you grow old, Life passing like a tale that's told, She, like the sun's auspicious ray, Shines more and more to perfect day, Her very pastimes shew good sense; Her Beauty her least excellence. ON THE AUTHOR's BIRTH-DAY. Now six and thirty rapid years are fled, Since I began, nor yet begin, to live; Painful reflection! to look back I dread, What hope, alas! can looking forward give! Day urges day, and year succeeds to year, While hoary age steals unperceiv'd along; Summer is come, and yet no fruits appear, My joys a dream, my works an idle song. Ah me! I fondly thought, Apollo shone With beams propitious on my natal hour; Fair was my morn, but now at highest noon Shades gather round, and clouds begin to lour. Yes, on thy natal hour, the God replies, I shone propitious, and the Muses smil'd; Blame not the pow'rs, they gave thee wings to rise, But earth thou lov'st, by low delights beguil'd. Possessing wealth, beyond a Poet's lot, Thou the dull track of lucre hast prefer'd, For contemplation form'd and lofty thought, Thou meanly minglest with the vulgar herd. True Bards select and sacred to the Nine Listen not thus to pleasure's warbling lays; Nor on the downy couch of ease recline, Severe their lives, abstemious are their days. Oh! born for nobler ends, dare to be wise, 'Tis not e'en now too late, assert thy claim; Rugged the path, that leads up to the skies, But the fair guerdon is immortal fame. ON A FIT OF THE GOUT. AN ODE. Wherefore was Man thus form'd with eye sublime, With active joints to traverse hill or plain, But to contemplate Nature in her prime, Lord of this ample world, his fair domain? Why on this various earth such beauty pour'd, But for thy pleasure, Man, her sovereign lord? Why does the mantling vine her juice afford Nectareous, but to cheer with cordial taste? Why are the earth and air and ocean stor'd With beast, fish, fowl; if not for Man's repast? Yet what avails to me, or taste, or sight, Exil'd from every object of delight? So much I feel of anguish, day and night Tortur'd, benumb'd; in vain the fields to range Me vernal breezes, and mild suns invite, In vain the banquet smokes with kindly change Of delicacies, while on every plate Pain lurks in ambush, and alluring fate. Fool, not to know the friendly powers create These maladies in pity to mankind: These abdicated Reason reinstate When lawless Appetite usurps the mind; Heaven's faithful centries at the door of bliss Plac'd to deter, or to chastise excess. Weak is the aid of wisdom to repress Passion perverse; philosophy how vain! 'Gainst Circe's cup, enchanting sorceress; Or when the Syren sings her warbling strain. Whate'er or sages teach, or bards reveal, Men still are men, and learn but when they feel. As in some free and well-pois'd common-weal Sedition warns the rulers how to steer, As storms and thunders ratling with loud peal, From noxious dregs the dull horizon clear; So when the mind imbrutes in sloth supine, Sharp pangs awake her energy Divine. Cease then, oh cease, fond mortal, to repine At laws, which Nature wisely did ordain; Pleasure, what is it? rightly to define, 'Tis but a short-liv'd interval from pain: Or rather, each, alternately renew'd, Give to our lives a sweet vicissitude. AN ODE, ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE CHARLES YORKE. Charles, son of Yorke, who on the mercy-seat Of justice states the bounds of right and wrong; Not like the vulgar law-bewilder'd throng, Who in the maze of error hope to meet Truth, or hope rather to delude with lies And airy phantoms, under truth's disguise. Some wrapt in precedents, and points decreed, Or lop or stretch the law to forms precise: Some, who the pedantry of rules despise, Plain sense adopt, from legal fetters freed; Sense without science, fleeting, unconfin'd, Is empty guess, and shifts with ev'ry wind. But he, thy sire, with more discerning toil, Rang'd the wide field, sagacious to explore, Where lay dispers'd or hid the precious ore; Then form'd into a Whole the gather'd spoil. Law, reason, equity, which now unite, Reflecting each on each a friendly light. Blest in a guide, a pattern so compleat, Tread, as thou do'st, his footsteps; for not rude Thy genius, not uncultur'd, unsubdu'd. Yet there are intervals, and seasons meet, To smooth the brow of thought; nor thou disdain Fit hour of vacance with the Muse's train. Let meaner spirits, cast in common mould, Who feed on husks of learned lore, refuse To hear the lessons of the warbling Muse; Nor know that bards, the law-givers of old, By soothing song to moral truth beguil'd Man, till then fierce, a lawless race, and wild. What means the lyre, by which the fabled sage Drew beasts to listen, and made rocks advance Around him as he play'd, in mystick dance? What, but the Muse? who soften'd human rage: Parent of concord, she prepar'd the plan Of social life, and man attun'd to man. She taught the spheres to move in fair array, Each in their orbits heark'ning to her strain; Else would they wander o'er th'etherial plain Licentious, but that she directs their way: She aw'd to temper, by her magick spell, The warring elements, and powers of hell. They err, who think the Muses not ally'd To Themis; both are of celestial birth: Both give peace, order, harmony to earth: Both by one heav'nly fountain are supply'd; And men and angels hymn, in general quire, What law ordains, and what the Nine inspire. AN EPODE. Written about the End of the Year 1756. [Now domes and obelisks o'erspread the plain] Now domes and obelisks o'erspread the plain, Where laughing Ceres us'd to reign; Lands, that of old repaid their owner's care, Are now trim walks, and gay parterre. Hills sink to vallies, vallies swell to hills, Rocks gush with artificial rills. Vain petulance of wealth! this gaudy scene, What boots it, if unquiet spleen Breeds new desires; and squeamish appetite Loaths what was yesterday's delight? Better the hardy Swiss, who tills the soil, Lives on his little, earn'd by toil; There fair equality, proportion'd wealth, Preserve the commonweal in health; The farmer there beholds in lands his own Flocks feeding, and plantations grown. Laws and example there controul intrigue, No stain pollutes the marriage league, No portion'd wives presume to domineer, Virtue is all their portion there. Is there, who seeks a patriot's honest fame, Bold faction let him dare to tame, And madd'ning licence; acts, like these, shall raise A monument to latest days. But vain the task to blame degen'rate times, If timid justice wink on crimes; Enormities unpunish'd gather force Grown by example things of course. Morals, that give authority to law, No longer hold the land in awe. But great and small alike pay rites divine, At Belial's or at Mammon's shrine. There offer all the charities of life, The niece, the sister, and the wife. Inhuman sacrifice! Go then, and bawl For Freedom; she disdains thy call. Freedom he loves not, who enslav'd within Thinks poverty the greatest sin. On virtue only freedom is bestow'd, None win or woe her, but the good. Simplicity of manners, frugal taste, To what new climate are ye chas'd? Instead of theseâbut oh! my Muse, forbear, And let our foes the rest declare. Tell it, with triumph, France, who best can tell, What arts you tried, what magic spell, Thus to transform, and into apes debase A gallant once, and manly race; Those, who your arms for ages have withstood, Are by your fopperies subdued. Oh, too severe revenge for all the slain, Whose blood once fatten'd Cressy's plain; Go, now secure, go, scatter wide and far, O'er nations more than hostile war; Till one by one a prey to force or fraud, Grow patient of the Gallic rod. Yet though the black'ning storm in full career Rolls nearer on, and still more near, Britain unactive sees the spreading waste, Content to be devour'd the last; In utmost need, not daring to defend Her best, her last remaining friend: Who asks, but to restore her ancient might, And teach her veterans, how to fight. Rouse, Britons, rouse, where Europe's loud alarms, Where Glory calls, to arms, to arms. Inspir'd by Him, whose wond'rous deeds contain An Iliad within one campaign. Her menac'd isle can Britain hope to save By troops in war untried, though brave? In foreign realms first purchase fair renown, So shall you best protect your own. Hard lesson! say, ye Knights of Arthur's, say, Who would exchange ease, pleasure, play, For toil, for hunger; and in perils share With Him, whose very sport is war? Not so of oldâin fam'd Eliza's days Each candidate for martial praise Return'd instructed from the Belgic school, How to obey, and how to rule; No toil, no danger, could their efforts quell; Witness the field where Sidney fell, Alike in counsel, and in arms supreme, Sidney the Muses darling theme, Himself a Muse;âoh! had propitious fate Giv'n to thy years a riper date, Frederick's exploits, which now with lustre shine Superior, had but equall'd thine. Whom shall we find to rival Sidney's fame, And reassert our ancient claim? Ah! hope not drooping vigour to restore By laws, the cordial of an hour; Let Education, Britain, be thy care, The long neglected soil prepare For future harvests, now a thorny wood Untill'd, uncultur'd, unsubdued: The stinging nettle, the dull nightshade's pow'r, Each weed that counterfeits a flow'r, The teasing burr, the creeper sure to wound The tree that raised it from the ground, Pluck up betimes; eradicate the growth Of faction, foppery, and sloth, And treacherous ambition; these replace With virtues of a generous race: Calm courage, industry, and modest truth, Plant in the breast of easy youth; So shall maturer age the laws revere, And morals do the work of fear. A TRANSLATION OF A FRAGMENT OF SOLON, PRESERVED IN THE ORATION OF DEMOSTHENES DE FALSA LEGATIONE. ??????? ?? ????? ? ? ?. Athens, to tutelary Pallas dear, Hath nothing from the Gods to fear; No, to her sons alone she owes her doom, The dire distemper lurks at home; Commons contending to be bought and sold, Rulers who riot uncontroul'd, Insatiate, though abounding, void of sense To relish decent competence; No ties or human or divine restrain, So lawless is the lust of gain; Each preys on each, yet with consenting zeal All join to rob the commonweal, And claim it, as the birth-right of the strong, To leap the bounds of right and wrong; Yet Justice, who the present sees and past, Though silent, will avenge at last. These are the maladies, which soon or late Bring desolation on a State; Hence civil discord springs, hence hostile rage Awaken'd, spares nor sex nor age; And cities, where none govern or obey, Must fall to foreign arms a prey. Such is the general fate, amongst the poor Some exiled on a distant shore, Enslav'd, imprison'd, lockt in cruel chains, Thus publick evil spreads like a disease From house to house through all degrees; The rich against it bar their gates in vain, No bars, no fences fate restrain: Still she pursues, and haunts, where'er ye dwell, Or in a palace, or a cell. Learn hence, Athenians, timely learn to know, What ills from lawless licence flow; Good laws diffuse good order through the whole, Th'unjust by fit restraints controul, Polish rough manners, curb unbridled will, Daunt pride, and crop the buds of ill, Restore warpt justice, bid oppression cease, Sooth party-rancour into peace, Quell stubborn faction, heal litigious strife, And give and guard the sweets of life.</field>
