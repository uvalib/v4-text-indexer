      <field name="fulltext">ODES TO H. D. TRAILL Traill, at whose board 'tis good to sit, And take no thought of hours that flit Fledged with the tongues of bard and witâ (Though none, or few, The latter title may befit So well as you)â 'Tis now a twelve-month's space and more Since feet of mine have sought your door, There where one fancies London's roar Long leagues away, And Thames an old-time-haunted shore Keeps to this day. For I, with course 'twere hard to trace, Have southward, northward, set my face, Coy to the vast and vague embrace Of London's arms, The siren's all-too liberal grace And venal charms. Daily on matron, man, and maid, The dome of Wren hath cast its shade, But I beyond its beck have strayed By land and sea; And you a hundred mots have made Unheard by me! The loser I. Yet mine some gain From vagrant hours of sun and rain And steps that still by mount or plain Carried a mind To one thing constant, as the vane Is to the windâ The service of that mistress hard To whom a fixed and sole regard Your vowed and dedicated bard Dares not refuse, Would he at last the least reward Win from his Muse. For still we rhymers, great or small, Must gather, would we live at all, Such casual manna as may fall, A niggard meed, On mortals whom the immortals call But seldom feed. And so, perhaps with fond pretence That to the force of sheer, immense, Importunate lyric opulence Our lays are due, We publish all our soul for penceâ Ay me, how few! Happiest and best of singers he, Who, in Art's bondage greatly free, Can harvest, from all things that be, Grist for the mill Whose wheel a copious Castaly Turns at his will. Whate'er we know, whate'er we dream, All things that are, all things that seem, All that in Nature's Academe Her graduates learn, Was Bacon's province, Shakespeare's theme, Goethe's concern. The poem, well the poet knows, In ambush lurks where'er he goes,â Lisps hidden in each wind that blows, Laughs in each wave, Sighs from the bosom of the rose, Wails from the grave. And Orphic laws of lute and verse All the symphonious worlds coerce, That hour by hour their parts rehearse, Winds, strings, and reeds, In this orchestral universe The Maestro leads. But though all life and death and birth, And all the heaven's enzoning girth, Earth, and the waters 'neath the earth, Are Song's domain, Nor aught so lowly but is worth The loftiest strain,â 'Tis from those moods in which Life stands With feet earth-planted, yet with hands Stretched toward visionary lands, Where vapours lift A moment, and aÃ«rial strands Gleam through the rift, The poet wins, in hours benign, At older than the Delphic shrine, Those intimations faint and fine, To which belongs Whatever character divine Invest his songs. And could we live more near allied To cloud and mountain, wind and tide, Cast this unmeaning coil aside, And go forth free, The World our goal, Desire our guide,â We then might see Those master moments grow less rare, And oftener feel that nameless air Come rumouring from we know not where; And touch at whiles Fantastic shores, the fringes fair Of fairy isles, And hail the mystic bird that brings News from the inner courts of things, The eternal courier-dove whose wings Are never furled; And hear the bubbling of the springs That feed the world. You smile at this too soaring strain? Well, in the smile is no disdain; And if a more terrestrial vein Befit my rhymeâ I promise not to soar again, At least, this time. And sooth to say, a humbler end This verse was meant to serve, O friend: For since to you I may not wend (Such leagues deter The else not laggard feet), I send This messenger; And bid him tarry not, but flee, And greet you well where'er you be; And pray he may not piteously Faint by the roadâ Of good regards for thine and thee So large his load. TO ARTHUR CHRISTOPHER BENSON In that grave shade august That round your Eton clings, To you the centuries must Be visible corporate things, And the high Past appear Affably real and near, For all its grandiose airs, caught from the mien of Kings. The new age stands as yet Half built against the sky, Open to every threat Of storms that clamour by: Scaffolding veils the walls, And dim dust floats and falls, As, moving to and fro, their tasks the masons ply. But changeless and complete, Rise unperturbed and vast, Above our din and heat, The turrets of the Past, Mute as that city asleep, Lulled with enchantments deep, Far in Arabian dreamland built where all things last. Who loves not to explore That palace of Old Time, Awed by the spires that soar In ghostly dusk sublime, And gorgeous-windowed halls, And leagues of pictured walls, And dungeons that remember many a crimson crime? Yet, in those phantom towers Not thine, not mine, to dwell, Rapt from the living hours By some rich lotus-spell; And if our lute obey A mode of yesterday, 'Tis that we deem 'twill prove to-morrow's mode as well. This neighbouring joy and woeâ This present sky and seaâ These men and things we know, Whose touch we would not fleeâ To us, O friend, shall long Yield aliment of song: Life as I see it lived is great enough for me. In high relief against That reverend silence set, Wherein your days are fenced From the world's peevish fret, There breaks on old Earth's ears The thunder of new years, Rousing from ancient dreams the Muse's anchoret. Well if the coming time, With loud and strident tongue, Hush not the sound of rhyme, Drown not the song half sung, Ev'n as a dissonant age Choked with polemic rage The starriest voice that e'er on English ears hath rung, And bade her seer a while Pause and put by the bard, Till this tormented isle, With feuds and factions jarred, Some leisure might regain To hear the long-pent strain Re-risen from storm and fire, immortal and unmarred. LAKELAND ONCE MORE Region separate, sacred, of mere, and of ghyll, and of mountain, Garrulous, petulant beck, sinister, laughterless tarn; Haunt of the vagabond feet of my fancy for ever reverting, Haunt and home of my heart, Cumbrian valleys and fells; Yours of old was the beauty that rounded my hours with a nimbus, Touched my youth with bloom, tender and magical light; You were my earliest passion, and when shall my fealty falter? Ah, when Helvellyn is low! ah, when Winander is dry! For had I not dwelt where Nature but prattled familiar language, Trite the theme and the word, prose of the hedges and lanes? Here she spake to my spirit in lofty and resonant numbers, Rhythms of epical mood, silences great as her song. Time hath scattered his gifts; and Death, he hath taken his tribute: East and west have I fared, hitherward, thitherward blown; Watched in jewelled midnight the Mediterranean twinkling; Watched, from Como's wave, pinnacled summits on fire; Heard the tempest beleaguer the bases of savage Tantallon; Heard the thundering tide crash on Devonian shores: And fair and stormy fortune my life's little pinnace hath weathered, Shattering onsets of joy, shocks of calamity, borne; Mine hath been good unstinted, nor niggard my portion of evil; Friendships mine and hates, love and a whisper of fame: But ever to you I return, O land in the dusk of whose portals Rustles my Past like leaves, memories brush me as wings, Meets me my alien phantom, the self that is dead, that is vanished, Echoes meet me and dreams, shadows that sigh and depart; And ever, O meres and valleys, an aureole haunts you of roselight, Glamour of luminous hours, wraith of my passion of old, And the brows of eternal Helvellyn are flushed with a virginal rapture, Lit with the glow of my youth, crimsoned with dawn of my day. DOMINE, QUO VADIS? A LEGEND OF THE EARLY CHURCH Darkening the azure roof of Nero's world, From smouldering Rome the smoke of ruin curled; And the fierce populace went clamouringâ âThese Christian dogs, 'tis they have done this thing!â So to the wild wolf Hate were sacrificed The panting, huddled flock whose crime was Christ. Now Peter lodged in Rome, and rose each morn Looking to be ere night in sunder torn By those blind hands that with inebriate zeal Burned the strong Saints, or broke them on the wheel, Or flung them to the lions to make mirth For dames that ruled the lords that ruled the earth. And unto him, their towering rocky hold, Repaired those sheep of the Good Shepherd's fold In whose white fleece as yet no blood or foam Bare witness to the ravening fangs of Rome. âMore light, more cheap,â they cried, âwe hold our lives Than chaff the flail or dust the whirlwind drives: As chaff they are winnowed and as dust are blown; Nay, they are nought; but priceless is thine own. Not in yon streaming shambles must thou die; We counsel, we entreat, we charge thee, fly!â And Peter answered: âNay, my place is here; Through the dread storm, this ship of Christ I steer. Blind is the tempest, deaf the roaring tide, And I, His pilot, at the helm abide.â Then one stood forth, the flashing of whose soul Enrayed his presence like an aureole. Eager he spake; his fellows, ere they heard, Caught from his eyes the swift and leaping word. âLet us, His vines, be in the wine-press trod, And poured a beverage for the lips of God; Or, ground as wheat of His eternal field, Bread for His table let our bodies yield. Behold, the Church hath other use for thee; Thy safety is her own, and thou must flee. Ours be the glory at her call to die, But quick and whole God needs His great ally.â And Peter said: âDo lords of spear and shield Thus leave their hosts uncaptained on the field, And from some mount of prospect watch afar The havoc of the hurricane of war? Yet, if He wills it. . . . Nay, my task is plain,â To serve, and to endure, and to remain. But weak I stand, and I beseech you all Urge me no more, lest at a touch I fall.â There knelt a noble youth at Peter's feet, And like a viol's strings his voice was sweet. A suppliant angel might have pleaded so, Crowned with the splendour of some starry woe. He said: âMy sire and brethren yesterday The heathen did with ghastly torments slay. Pain, like a worm, beneath their feet they trod. Their souls went up like incense unto God. An offering richer yet, can Heaven require? O live, and be my brethren and my sire.â And Peter answered: âSon, there is small need That thou exhort me to the easier deed. Rather I would that thou and these had lent Strength to uphold, not shatter, my intent. Already my resolve is shaken sore. I pray thee, if thou love me, say no more.â And even as he spake, he went apart, Somewhat to hide the brimming of his heart, Wherein a voice came flitting to and fro, That now said âTarry!â and anon said âGo!â And louder every moment, âGo!â it cried, And âTarry!â to a whisper sank, and died. And as a leaf when summer is o'erpast Hangs trembling ere it fall in some chance blast, So hung his trembling purpose and fell dead; And he arose, and hurried forth, and fled, Darkness conniving, through the Capuan Gate, From all that heaven of love, that hell of hate, To the Campania glimmering wide and still, And strove to think he did his Master's will. But spectral eyes and mocking tongues pursued, And with vague hands he fought a phantom brood. Doubts, like a swarm of gnats, o'erhung his flight, And âLord,â he prayed, âhave I not done aright? Can I not, living, more avail for Thee Than whelmed in yon red storm of agony? The tempest, it shall pass, and I remain, Not from its fiery sickle saved in vain. Are there no seeds to sow, no desert lands Waiting the tillage of these eager hands, That I should beastlike 'neath the butcher fall, More fruitlessly than oxen from the stall? Is earth so easeful, is men's hate so sweet, Are thorns so welcome unto sleepless feet, Have death and heaven so feeble lures, that I, Choosing to live, should win rebuke thereby? Not mine the dread of pain, the lust of bliss! Master who judgest, have I done amiss?â Lo, on the darkness brake a wandering ray: A vision flashed along the Appian Way. Divinely in the pagan night it shoneâ A mournful Faceâa Figure hurrying onâ Though haggard and dishevelled, frail and worn, A King, of David's lineage, crowned with thorn. âLord, whither farest?â Peter, wondering, cried. âTo Rome,â said Christ, âto be re-crucified.â Into the night the vision ebbed like breath; And Peter turned, and rushed on Rome and death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS, LYRICS, AND MISCELLANEOUS PIECES AFTER THE TITANS England, in good Victoria's latter reign, Two potent councillors by turns have led, Little alike in build of heart or head, Yet owning this resemblance,âthat the twain Are visibly of Britain's ancient strain, Sprung of the lineage of her stalwart dead, Strong souls and massive, such as England bred In the brave day that cometh not again. To these succeeds another, newer race, Men light and slight, on narrower scale designed, Offspring and image of the change we trace In art, arms, action, manners, morals, mind,â The burly oak departing, in its place The lissom willow, swaying to the wind. THE RIVALS Man's good and evil angels came to dwell As housemates, at his board and hearth alway; One, secret as the night, one, frank as day, Both lovely, and in puissance matched full well. Each hourly strove her sleepless foe to quell, And ever and anon the bright fiend lay Foiled, and her countenance, racked with sick dismay, Changed, and its tyrannous beauty masklike fell. Ah, could man's thought for ever fix and stay That glimpse of horrors he might quake to tell 'Twere easy, then, the temptress to repel! But 'neath the glorious mask and brave array How shall he know thee, leprous witch of hell, Robed to allure and fanged to rend and slay? A NEW NATIONAL ANTHEM God save our ancient land, God bless our noble land, God save our land! Yea, from war's pangs and fears, Plague's tooth and famine's tears, Ev'n unto latest years God save our land! God bless our reigning race! Truth, honour, wisdom, grace, Guide their right hand! Yet, though we love their sway, England is more than they: God bless their realm, we pray, God save our land! Too long the gulf betwixt This man and that man fixt Yawns yet unspanned. Too long, that some may rest, Tired millions toil unblest. God lift our lowliest, God save our land! God save our ancient land, God bless our noble land, God save our land! Earth's empires wax and wane, Man's might is mown as grain: God's arm our arm sustain! God save our land! THE SIXTY-FIVE ELEMENTS (Written after reading Lord Salisbury's Address at the British Association) Master, I marvel not at all, that these Mock at the wit that would their meaning seize. A maiden's sighâthe descant of a birdâ Me with triumphant riddles taunt and tease. I well believe, despite of all he knows, The wonder of the sweetness of a rose, The wonder of the wild heart of a song, Shall shame man's foolish wisdom to the close. The secrets of the gods are from of old Guarded for ever and for ever told,â Blabbed in all ears, but published in a tongue Whose purport the gods only can unfold. A NEW YEAR'S PRAYER In the blanched night, when all the world lay frore, And the cold moon, the passionless, looked down Commiserating man the passion-curstâ Man made in passion and by passion marredâ Through the pale silence, on the New Year's verge, This prayer fled forth, and trembled up to heaven:â âO Thou whose dwelling is eternity; Who seest the hunger and the toil of men, And how the love of life and wife and babe Is brother of hate and sire of deeds of death; Give peaceâgive peace: peace in our time, O Lord! âBut if we needs must march to peace through war, Spare not the sowers who amid Thy corn Mingled the lethal seed of this red flower; The whirlwind let them reap who sow the wind. Make terrible Thine arm against all thieves Whether in mart or on imperial throne; And scatter with Thy thunder the unjust Who turn thy pleasance to a wilderness, To battlefields Thy vineyard, with mailed feet Trampling the joyous vine of life in blood. âPurge and renew this England, once so fair, When Arthur's knights were armed with nobleness, Or Alfred's wisdom poised the sacred scales; Yea, and in later times, when Liberty, Her crowned and crosiered enemies combating, Stood proudlier 'stablished by a false king's fall, Mighty from Milton's pen and Cromwell's sword, Terribly beauteous, passionately just, Seared with hell's hate, and in her scars divine.â New Year's Eve, 1892. MALIGN BEAUTY A face like morning, with a heart of night! Not though in deserts fanged with death thou roam, Or couch 'mid monsters of the ooze and foam, Shalt thou be blasted with so dread a sight As when a soul whose errand is to blight And shatter, makes a glorious body its home, Foul tenant of a stately palace-dome, Imperial towers, and gardens of delight Look through her windows! See,âa pilgrim guest Is feasted by the bounteous chÃ¢telaine. Fledged are the hours with wine and song and jest. The morrow cometh. Shall he rise and hie Forth on his way? He grasps his staff in vain, In her deep dungeons flung, to rot and die. TO ONE WHO HAD WRITTEN IN DERISION OF THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY Dismiss not so, with light, hard phrase and cold, Ev'n if it be but fond imagining, The hope whereto so passionately cling The dreaming generations from of old! Not thus, to luckless men, are tidings told Of mistress lost, or riches taken wing; And is eternity a slighter thing, To have or lose, than kisses or than gold? Nay, tenderly, if needs thou must, disprove My loftiest fancy, dash my grand desire To see this curtain lift, these clouds retire, And Truth, a boundless dayspring, blaze above And round me; and to ask of my dead sire His pardon for each word that wronged his love. LINES WRITTEN IN RICHMOND PARK Lady, were you but here! The Autumn flames away, And pensive in the antlered shade I stray. The Autumn flames away, his end is near. I linger where deposed and fall'n he lies, Prankt in his last poor tattered braveries, And think what brightness would enhance the Day, Lady, were you but here. Though hushed the woodlands, though sedate the skies, Though dank the leaves and sere, The storÃ¨d sunlight in your hair and eyes Would vernalise November, and renew the agÃ¨d year, Lady! were you but here.</field>
