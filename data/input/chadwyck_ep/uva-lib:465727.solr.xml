      <field name="fulltext">SEVERAL Scripture Songs Taken out of the Old and New-Testament. With some other Spiritual Songs; &amp;c. The pagination of the source document has been followed. Moses's Song, on Exod. 15. [The first part.] 1 I to the Lord, will sing, Triumph in him also; The Horses and the Riders he Into the Sea did throw. 2 Jehovah is my Song, And my Salvation; My God, for whom I will prepare An Habitation: 3 My Father's God was he, Whose Glory I'll proclaim, Jehovah is a Man of War, Jehovah is his Name. 4 Proud Pharoah, and his Host, Into the Sea are cast, And his great Captains drowned be, As through the Sea they past. 5 They down to th'bottom sank, Ev'n like unto a Stone; Jehovah thy Right Hand in Pow'r, Most Glorious is become: 6 Thy Right Hand hath destroy'd Those that against thee rose; And in thy Glorious Excellency, Thou hast o'erthrown thy Foes. The second Part. 1 Thou didst send forth thy Wrath, Like stubble them to waste, Lord, thou didst blow, and the proud Waves, O'erwhelm'd them with a Blast. 2 The Sea stood up in heaps For Israel, (on each side) The Enemy said, I will pursue, I will the Spoil divide? 3 My Lust I will fulfill, My Sword draw out will I? My Hand shall now cut them all off, And Ruin utterly? 4 Thou with thy Wind didst blow, And they were covered, They in the Mighty Waters sunk, As if they had been Lead. 5 Lord, who is like to Thee, In Holiness Glor'us, Fearful in Praise, and also doth Things that are marvellous. A Prophetical Part of Moses's Song, Deut. 32. 1 Give Ear, O Heavens, I will speak and let also the Earth, Hear the good Words of my own Mouth, which now I shall bring forth, 2 My Doctrin like the Rain shall drop, my Speech distil shall as The Dew does on the tender Herbs, and showers on the Grass. 3 Because that I Jehovahs Name will publish and make known; I will ascribe greatness to God, yea, and to him alone. 4 He is the Rock, and Perfect too his Ways and Judgments be; A God of Truth, and without Sin, both Just and Right is he. 3 Because their Rock unto our Rock is not to be compar'd; Yea, though our Enemies themselves, as Judges should be heard: 5 Vengeance is mine, I will repay, in time their Feet shall slide, Their dreadful Day it does draw near, and Woe shall them betide. 6 Because the Lord his Saints shall judg, and for them he'll Repent, When none shut up, or lift he sees, when all their Power's spent. 7 Then sing ye Nations with his Saints, revenge their Blood will he, And render Vengeance to his Foes, but kind to his Saints be. The Song of the Prophet Isaiah. chap. 5. 1 I to my Well-beloved, now, and of his Vine-yard (will Sing a sweet Song) which he has set, upon a fruitful Hill; 2 He Fenced it, and gather'd out the Stones that did offend, He Planted it with choicest Vine, and it he did defend: 3 A Tower in the midst he built, and made a Wine-Press too, And lookt that it should bring forth Fruit, his Glory great to show; 4 But it brought forth Wild Grapes: Alass! to thee, Jerusalem, And Judah also I'll appeal, and to all thinking Men; 5 'Twixt Me and my Vine-yard to Judge; what further do could I Unto my Vine-yard? when I loo'kt, no Fruit could I espy: 6 Instead of Grapes, it did bring forth Wild Grapes: O then go to, Unto my Vine-yard, I'll declare what 'tis that I will do. 7 I'll take away the Hedge thereof, my Anger shall be shown, Eat up it shall, and it's strong Wall shall quite be overthrown; 8 And I will lay it Waste, and it not Dig, nor Prune again; But there shall come Bryers and Thorns, and on it fall no Rain. 9 For the House of Israel, and the Men of Judah be The pleasant Vine-yard of the Lord; but when he lookt to see 10 Judgment and true Justice done, Oppression did espy; And when he look'd for Righteousness, behold! a bitter Cry. Isaiah's Joyful Song. Isa. 12. 1 Jehovah I will give thee Praise, this is the very Day, For thou dost sweetly Comfort me, thine Anger's turn'd away: 2 Behold thou my Salvation art, I will not be afraid, Jehovah is my Strength and Song, my Trust and saving Aid: 3 Therefore with Gladness I will draw Water out of the Wells Of Salvation (for they be thy People Israels. 4 And in that Day shall ye all say, praise the Lord, on his Name Not only call, but for his Acts lift up his glor'us Fame. 5 Sing ye unto the Lord, for he most excellent things has done; And this throughout the Earth also, is now most fully known. 6 Cry out, and shout, and joyful be, all that in Sion dwell; For great the Holy One's in Thee, O happy Israel! The Song of Zacharias. 1 Let Jsrael's great God and King eternally be Bless'd, Whose come from Heav'n to visit us, and see our bonds, releas'd. 2 In Davids House a Saviour's rais'd, to sit upon his throne; This ever since the World began, his Prophets have foreshown. 3 That he would save us from the Pow'r and Malice of our Foes; The Mercy to perform to them, which he of old had chose. 4 He call'd to mind how he engag'd his truth, by Covenant, His Solemn Oath to Abraham sworn, that he his Grace would grant 5 To serve him without fear; from all our Adversaries freed; And to continue all our days, a Holy Life to lead. 6 By the Remission of our Sins, to make Salvation known, To all his People every where, his tender Mercy's shown. 7 The Day-Star from on high is rose, and those who also sit In Darkness, he in the right way of Peace will guide their Feet. The Song of the Blessed Virgin. Luke. 1. 1 My Soul does magnify the Lord, my Spirit does rejoyce In God, my Saviour, who deserv'st the Praise of Heart and Voice. 2 For his poor Hand-Maid he regards, whose Mind was sore deprest; And all Ages from hence forth shall call me most truly Blest. 3 He that is great hath Wonders done, and holy is his Name; His Mercies hath for ever been to his Saints, still the same. 4 He with his Strength hath pulled down the Mighty from their Seat; And them of Low and Base Degree, are rais'd to Honour great. 5 He fill'd the Hungry Soul, with Good, the Rich Empty remain'd; His Mercy he has call'd to mind, his People help have gain'd. 6 The Promise to our Fathers made, in the which he long stood, Engag'd to Abraham and his Seed, he hath at last made good. The Song of Simeon, Luke, 2. 29. 1 Now let thy Servant, Lord, depart in Peace, to quiet Rest, Since I have thy Salvation seen, and with the same am blest: 2 The Prophecies are now fulfill'd, thy Promises are true; And thy Mysterious Love's disclos'd, in all thy Peoples view. 3 A Light to lighten the Dark Earth, now this bright Sun appears, The Gentiles shall enlighten'd be, sweet Comforts shall them cheer. 4 Well may the long expected Sight, make Israel's Joy abound; Before with special Favours Grac'd, but now with Glory Crown'd. Part of Hannahs Song, 1 Sam. 2. [as 100th Psalm.] 1 My heart doth in Jehovah joy, My Horn in Jah is lift on high; My Mouth's inlarged o'er my Foes, In thy Salvation joy will I. 2 There's none so Holy as the Lord, No, no, there is none beside thee Of other Rocks, there is not one; That to our God compar'd may be. 3 Talk ye no more so Proudly then, Let not Arrogancy once proceed Out of your Mouth, for God doth know, And 'tis by him Actions are weigh'd. 4 The Lord both Poor and Rich does make, He raiseth up and pulleth down; Thee Poor he up from Dust does take, And Beggars from the Dunghil Crown. 5 And sets them on a Princely Throne, In Glorious Power and Dignity; The Pillars of the Earth's the Lords, The World is his, him Glorifies. 6 He keeps the feet of all his Saints, Preserves them so they shall not fail, The Vile in darkness shall be still, For no man shall by strength prevail. 7 The Adversaries of the Lord, Shall broken be both great and small; The Lord from Heaven Thunder will, And in his Wrath destroy them all, 8 The Lord shall Reign most Gloriously, Unto the ends of all the Earth: And his Anointed Horn exalt, Therefore his highest Praise sing forth. The Song of the Lamb. [The first Part.] 1 Break out ye Saints with joy and sing, to the Eternal King; The Angels do blest Tidings bring, Hosannah in the highest. 2 In Bethlehem the Babe is born, cease, cease, your bitter Mourn, Your Sorrow now to Singing turn, Hosannah in the highest. 3 He's come, he's come, O happy Day! dark Shadows fly away, The Substance's come to Christ I say, Hosannah in the highest. 4 See how the Cherubs clap their Wings, the Glor'us Host now sings; Th'Eternal Day, see how it springs!

The third Part. 1 Christ will begin that Work, which he knows must be wrought, if we Eternal Joys do ever see, Hosannah in the highest. 2 Lord thou wilt perfect it also, for very well we know, Without thee we can nothing do, Hosannah in the highest. 3 We that Polluted once did ly in Filth and Misery, Thou by thy Blood dost purifie, Hosannah in the highest. 4 We once were Cursed by God's Law, dreading Death, no help saw, From that sad state thou dost us draw, Hosannah in the highest. 5 All kind of Sin thou dost pass by, where there's Sincerity, When unto thee, by Faith, we fly, Hosannah in the highest. 6 From Death to Life, Saints raised be, once bound, but now set free, And made one Spirit, O Lord, with thee, Hosannah in the Highest.

Hosannah in the highest. 2 Adoption is a precious thing, made Sons of th'Mighty King, Most precious Joy from hence doth spring, Hosannah in the highest. 3 Communion, Lord, also with Thee; nay, with th'whole Trinity, What higher Blessings can there be?

A Song of Praise for the Marvellous Deliverance of our Sovereign King, WILLIAM, with the Church, and whole Kingdom, from the Hellish Plot, Discovered, Feb. 1695/6 1 No change of Time shall ever shock Our firm Affections, Lord to Thee; For thou hast always been a Rock, A Fortress and Defence to me. 2 Our KING Preserved is, O God, By thy own hand and mighty Pow'r; Thou Shield'st him when he is Abroad, At home to him a lasting Tow'r. 3 The Chariot of the King of kings, Or Troops of mighty Angels round, Encompass him with Rapid Wings, And all his Foes with Shame Confound. 4 Black Thund'ring Clouds most thick conspir'd, With Threatning Rage our Face to Veil, But at thy brightness soon retir'd: Upon our foes falls Fire and Hail. 5 The Lord doth on our Side engage, From Heaven his Throne Our Cause upheld, And snatch'd us from the Furious Rage Of Threatning Waves that Proudly Swell'd; 6 God his resistless Pow'r employ'd, Our cruel Foes attempts to break; Or else they might have soon destroy'd The best Defence that we could make. 7 And Gods Designs shall still Succeed; Romes Bloody Sons can't stand the TEST, He's a Strong Shield to all that need, And on his sure Protection rest. 8 Who then deserv'st to be Ador'd, But God, on whom our Hopes depend, Or who, except the mighty Lord, Can with resistless Pow'r defend. 9 O let th'Eternal God be Prais'd, The Rock, on whose Defence we rest O'er highest Heav'ns his Name be rais'd, Who with Salvation us hath bless'd' 10 Therefore to celebrate his Fame, Our greatfull Voices to Heav'n we'll raise, Let Nations round dread his great Name, And all be Taught to Sing his Praise. 11 God to our King and Nation sends (Tho' Vile we be) Salvation sweet, Deliv'rance to his Saints extends, To Praise his Name therefore tis meet. 12 Hosannahs we to thee do owe, Let all the Nations Worship thee, And thee adore, yea thee alone, The Father of Eternity. 13 Thy Name in Songs we will adore Protect thy Saints, and Keep them Pure; To thee lets live for Evermore, Since from Curst Plots we are secure.</field>

The Eternity of the Great GOD. 1 In th'Regions of Eternal Light, thou hast most Holy God; From everlasting in thy Self, had thy own bless'd abode: 2 Before this World by thee was fram'd, or, Earth's Foundations laid; Or, the vast Heavens were spread forth or any Creature made. 3 Thou didst in Glory, Lord, abide; thy being hadst alone, In thy own Self, and none beside, was with the Holy One. 4 The Eternity of thy great Name, help us, Lord, to Adore: From everlasting thy dread Fame shone, and shall Evermore. 5 Thou Happy wast in thy own Self, and that in th'high'st degree; To thy essential Glory, Lord, nothing can added be, 6 Thou need'st not us; What canst thou have from any Creatures hand? Yet to ascribe all Praise to Thee, is thy most just Command. HYMN 2. The Immensity of GOD, 1 The Praise of the dread Majesty of the great God above, With trembling Heart I would sing forth, O with him fall in Love! 2 But what am I? poor sorry Dust that I should God admire! Be silent then, and let's give place unto the Heavenly Quire! 3 Thousands, and ten Thousands more of glorious Angels, stand Round thy high Throne, and Thee adore in Songs at thy Command. 4 Hosannahs they sing unto Thee, O Lord, continually. They worship and most perfect be; but, Ah! what, Lord, am I? 5 A Person of polluted Lips! how shall I then express The depth of thy Immensity? or thy Infiniteness? 6 I from thy Presence cannot go; what place, alass! is there To hide from Thee? for I do know, Lord, thou art every where! HYMN 3. On the Immensity and Omniscience of GOD. 1 Thy Knowledge, Lord, is infinite, there's nothing hid from Thee; Thou seest i'th' Dark as in the Light, our Thoughts before thee be. 2 From sight of thy All-seeing Eye, O whither can we go! In all dark Places thou dost pry, thine Eyes walk to and fro. 3 Thro' the whole Earth, where can we hide? O! whither can we fly? Lord, from thy Presence; for thou art far off, and also nigh! 4 Shall we to Heaven mount aloft, lo, Thou art present there? Or, if we should go down to Hell, ev'n there thou dost appear? 5 Yea, should we take us morning Wings and dwell beyond the Sea, There would thy Hand have hold on us, and quickly with 'us be? 6 Nay, if we say, The Darkness shall shroud us, Lord, from thy Sight, Alass! the thickest Darkness is to Thee, like to the Light? 7 Yea, Darkness hideth not from Thee, but Night doth shine as Day: Let's Praise Thee then both Day and Night, and sing to Thee alway! HYMN 4. The Wisdom of GOD great. 1 We of thy Wisdom will, O Lord, not only speak but sing; For 'tis from hence that all true Good to us, O Lord, doth spring. 2 Thy Wisdom and most Sovereign Grace most gloriously do shine; Let us see it with open Face, and Praise that Name of thine. 3 In thy own Wisdom let's be Wise; thy Wisdom let's Adore, And trust in it, so shall we, Lord, sing Praise for Evermore. 4 Thy Wisdom is a mighty deep, which Angels do admire; Creation-Work demonstrates it, Redemption rises higher. 5 The wonder of thy Wisdom, Lord, and sublime Rule likewise, Tis o'er all Things, and Persons here, and marv'lous in our Eyes. 6 All Wisdom Saints and Angels have, from Thee it doth proceed; And from thy Wisdom we receive all good things we do need. 7 Of thy amazing Wisdom then we'll sing continually; And unto Thee, let Foolish Men for Wisdom daily cry! HYMN 5. GOD's piercing Eyes. 1 Ye Saints remember God always, remember he is nigh; Nay, with us all in every place, and on us sets his Eye. 2 O Lord, out of thy piercing Sight there's none of us can go; Thou seest in Darkness as in Light, and know'st all things we do. 3 'Tis thy most great and glorious Name we should for ever Fear; And unto thee loud Praise proclaim, when to thee we draw near. 4 Always let us, O Lord, we pray, set Thee before our eyes, And never grieve thy Spirit, Lord, by our Iniquities. 5 Let's have a reverent awe of Thee, and always Thee adore And worship in Sincerity; so sing for Evermore. HYMN 6. The Power of GOD. 1 Who knows, Lord, what thy Power is, thou Glorious art in Might; Can ought be hard for Thee to do, whose Power's Infinite. 2 Thine Arm of Strength, most mighty King, both Rocks and Hearts doth break; O God thou canst do every thing which thou dost undertake. 3 O'er Men and Angels thou dost Reign, all things thou dost uphold; Thou art the strength of all thy Saints, thy Power's manifold. 4 Thou power hast for to Create, redeeming Pow'r's in Thee; Thou soon canst too annihilate all things which we do see. 5 None can before thy Power stand, nor thy dread Strength resist; Thy Pleasure thou wilt do we know, yea, all things thou dost list. 6 We of thy Power therefore sing, and in thy Might Rejoyce; To God our strength, our hope and trust, we will lift up our Voice. HYMN 7. GOD's Mercy shining: Or, The Chanel of Divine Mercy over-flowing. 1 We of thy Mercy, Lord, will sing, O it is Infinite! Of all our Joys it is the spring, let's Praise thee Day and Night: 2 Our Miseries will have an end, but thy Mercies abide From Age to Age, it does extend like to a swelling Tide, 3 That flows over all Banks and Bounds amazing to behold; O'er all the World thy Mercy sounds, O it is manifold! 4 But thy redeeming Mercy, Lord, we chiefly do admire; Christ is the Chanel where it runs, to raise the Wonder higher! 5 O Mercy then! Mercy we need, thy pardoning Mercy's sweet! Preventing Mercy does, in Christ, with every Mercy meet. 6 Sinners! take hold of Mercy then! let Saints Mercy adore: And for thy Mercy let all Men sing Praise for Evermore. HYMN 8.

HYMN 9. A Sacred Hymn on GOD's Sovereignty. 1 Thou Lord who didst all Creatures make, hast Power to dispose Of them, as seemeth good to thee: some therefore thou didst Chuse 2 Unto Eternal Life and Bliss; and others didst Pass-by: Or didst them leave to their Hearts Lusts, and vile Iniquity. 3 If thou hadst left all Adams Race Unto their evil Way, And not have giv'n one Soul thy Grace, O who dur'st Thee gain-say! 4 Or have charg'd thee to be Unjust, since all deserv'd to Die, 'Tis Infinite Grace that any be saved Eternally. 5 Thou sendest thy Sweet Gospel Light to this, and to that Place, But dost to many Lands deny the word of thine own Grace: 6 And some that hear it never feel its Power on their heart; All is as thou art pleas'd to act, and sovereign Grace impart. 7 We therefore Lord exalt thy Name, that with our eyes do see, Since thou hast made the difference, all Praise belongs to thee. HYMN 10. GOD's glorious Bounty: Or, Grace shining. 1 Thy Love, O Lord, is very great to such vile Ones as we; Such who lay Dead in Trespasses, are quickened by thee: 2 Thy Bounty to these Souls of ours, who can of it conceive: And those thou dost Regenerate this Bounty do receive. 3 'Tis they who are delivered from that Forelorn Estate, They once were in, when they lay Dead; whose souls, Lord, did thee Hate. 4 'Tis they whose Souls united be unto thy self, O Lord, And have Communion too with thee, thou dost this Grace afford. 5 Death can't dissolve this blessed Knot, this union doth remain; At Death such do to Jesus go, Death unto them is gain. 6 Well may such say unto their Souls, Return unto your rest! For they at Death to Glory go, and ly in thy Sweet Breast. 7 Their they do joyn with Seraphims, in blessed Harmony, To Sing and Celebrate thy Praise unto Eternity. HYMN 11. Abounding Mercy of God in Christ. 1 Is there no Mercy in the Lord? sinners! can you say so? Of Mercy sing with one accord, Mercy doth overflow! 2 The Waters which are in the Sea, and Light that's in the Sun, Are fewer than thy Mercies are, to sinners quite undone. 3 Thy Bowels yearn in thee to those who in their Blood do ly; If they Believe thou wilt forgive all their Iniquity: 4 But some will not thy Mercy have, they it do not desire; In the right Way, do it not crave; nor after it enquire! 5 But you that see the Chanel, where Mercy doth sweetly run, Exalt God's Name, and sing his Praise, until your Lives are done. 6 At Death and in the Judgment-day, God's mercy you shall find, If you do leave your evil Ways and have a changed Mind. 7 Redeeming Mercy that is sweet, and Pardoning Mercy sure; In Christ all Mercies joyn and meet, and evermore endure. HYMN 12. The Patience God. 1 What Wrongs, great God, hast thou long born? (conceiv'd they cannot be!) By daring Rebels, who provoke Thee unto Jealousie! 2 All Evils done in every place, before thine Eyes they are Throughout the World; And yet dost thou these Foes protect, and spare. 3 Tho' for Man's Treason down he fell, by thy revenging Hand; Yet he lifts up his bruised Bones his Maker to withstand; 4 And, though a feeble Foe he be, whom thou like Moths can crush, Yet still against the Bosses of thy Bucklar he does rush. 5 O what vile Monsters are Mankind! thus given to Rebel! Strange thou dost not, Lord, smite the Earth, and send them quick to Hell! 6 Man's sin for Vengeance loudly crys, yet Patience doth abound; Though Justice crys, Cut these Trees down! Why Cumber they the Ground? 7 Thy Patience still forbears, we see, O it is Infinite! Therefore of it, we, Lord, will sing, and Praise Thee Day and Night. HYMN 13. Another on God's Patience. 1 Would Man forbear to seek revenge on such a cursed Foe, Who strives to Murther him each Day, and work his Overthrow? 2 But God waves all advantages of wrath, and vengeance too; And, by amazing Patience, doth daring Man out-do? 3 The Creature doth disdain his God, by whom he's cloath'd and fed, Yet God still spares this rebel Worm, who by the Devil's led 4 To fight against his Sovereign with cruel spite and rage; Yet God doth still forbear with him, even from Age to Age. 5 Fools ask not where th'Almighty is, but Glory to him give: Is not his Being most fully prov'd in suffering thee to Live? 6 Was he not GOD, he could not bear such Weights as on him ly; Weak Mortals soon are set on fire, and for revenge do cry! 7 Why should not Patience make us sing, and God's great Glory raise? Lord, let thy Patience joyn with Love towards me all my Dayes! HYMN 14. On the Birth of CHRIST. [The First Part.] 1 Awake my Soul, awake my Tongue, my Glory wake and sing, And celebrate the holy Birth, the Birth of Jsraels King! 2 O happy Night that brought forth Light, which makes the Blind to see; The day Spring from on high came down to cheer and visit thee. 3 The careful Shepheards with their Flocks were watching for the Morn, But better News from Heav'n was brought; your Saviour is now born! 4 In Bethlehem the Infant lies, within a place obscure, Your Saviours come, O sing Gods Praise! O sing his Praise for ev'r. The Second Part, 25th Psalm Tune. 1 Heaven is come down to Earth Hither the Angels fly, Hark how the Heavenly Quire doth sing, Glory to God on high! 2 Blest News indeed, be glad; Simeon O'ercome with joy, Sings with the Infant in his Arms, Now let thy Servant die! 3 Wise-men behold the Star, Which was their stedfast Guide, Until it pointed forth the Babe: Let God be Glorify'd! 4 Heaven and Earth rejoyce O Lord! and shall not I? Christ he is Born! Sinners sing Praise, For you he came to Die! HYMN 15. A Sacred Hymn of the Deity of CHRIST. 1 In Thee, Lord Christ, we may Thy Father's Glory see; Thou his brightness and glory art, The God-head dwells in thee. 2 Thou art a Man, yet God, In thee both Natures meet, That God and Man thou mightst Unite In Union great and sweet. 3 Thou must be Man to Die: Sing Praise, ye Saints, sing Praise! Christ must be God to Satisfie; His Glory therefore raise! 4 Such that behold Thee, Lord, The Father also see; And such a Mediator 't did Behove thee for to be. 5 Thou lay'st thy Hands on both, And dost to each display Most equally thy dearest Love; And therefore we must say, 6 There's none, Lord, like to Thee For in thy Self does shine All Glories which the Father hath, most Sacred and Divine. HYMN 16. On CHRIST's Suretiship. 1 Lord we've run out, and wasted all our Riches and our Store; And now our Credit is quite gone thou wilt trust us no more: 2 Unless there is a Surety found we must in Prison ly, And bear thy dreadful Wrath, O God, unto Eternity. 3 And therefore Jesus thou didst send, no Friend had we to bring; All good from hence, we may perceive, doth from thy Bowels spring, 4 'Twas from the Worth and Dignity which in Christ's Person lay, He did God's Justice satisfie, and all our Debts defray. 5 O let Men dread how they despise such sovereign Grace and Love, Because Mysterious in their Eyes, and also far above 6 Depraved Reason to conceive, that such who guilty be, Should, by another's Righteousness, from Sin and Guilt be free. 7 Al praise and glory unto God, and to the Son whom we Adore; And to the Holy-Ghost likewise, be Praise for Evermore. HYMN 17. A Hymn of Christs divine Love, on Cant. 1. 1 Come near, come nearer yet and move thy sweetest Lips to mine? For why, thy Love, who art all Love, excels the choicest Wine! 2 Like to an Ointment Poured out, is thy sweet Name, and Favour; Wise Virgins compass thee about, for thy good Ointments Savour. 3 O Draw me with thy Cords of Love! we will run after thee; The King into his Chambers hath in Love Conducted me. 4 Thy rays will make our faces Shine, in thee we will rejoyce; Thy Love is better far than VVine; thou art the vpright's Choice! 5 But O thou, whom my Soul doth Love! Tell me, O tell me soon, Where feeds thy Flock; where is the place thou mak'st them rest at Noon? 6 Why should I stray and lose my way! till I at last do fall Among thy fellows Flocks (as they themselves do proudly Call.) 7 O fairest One; if thou wouldst know where thou shouldst feed and ly, The foot-steps of the Flock will show the way asuredly? HYMN 18. The Churches Spikenard, Cantic. the 1st. Sung at the Lord's-Supper. 1 Our King doth at his Table sit, and I that Love him well, Will pour my Spikenard on his feet, which gives a fragrant Smell. 2 My well-Beloved is to me a bundle of sweet Myrrh, And with me he'll make his abode, and from me never stir. 3 My well-Beloved is to me, like to the choicest VVines; Like Clusters of the Camphire Trees, amongst the fruitful Vines. 4 O blessed Jesus thou art fair, my beauty is from thee! Nay, thou art fair beyond compare, and precious unto me! 5 Let others on their Dainties feed, and drink the richest VVine; My feasts doth all their feasts exceed, when thou say'st I am thine. 6 I therefore will commend him still, and sing unto his Praise, He Dy'd for me, therefore shall be my Joy and Song always. HYMN 19. He's White &amp; Reddy, sung at the Sacrament. 1 My Hearts Delight is Red and white, the Lilly and the Rose: So sweet a Grace adorns his Face ten Thousand he out-does! 2 Was he all VVhite and was not Red? no Sufferer for my Sin? My Blood would rest on my own Head and no Joy have within! 3 But my dear Lord is VVite and Red, this mixture pleaseth me; Cause for my Sins he Suffered who from all Sin was free! 4 What a reviving Sight is this? a righteous Saviour's Blood Is th'bath of Sin, the spring of Bliss most Pure, most sweet and good! 5 His God-head, and his Government are infinite and Pure; His Eyes are like the Eyes of Doves, most constant, so indure. 6 His Mouth is most exceeding sweet, he's altogether so; Down from his Head unto his Feet all joys and comforts flow: 7 O Sing his Praise for this is he my soul doth so admire; This is my Friend, if you would know, this is my hearts desire!

HYMN 32. The Drooping Spirit Revived. 1 Come drooping Saints, ye princely ones, why do your heads hang down? Tho' some do fall yet Grace shall you with Glory ever Crown. 2 Christ bids you ever to Rejoyce, again he says Rejoyce, Whatever Sin or Satan faith 'tis your Beloveds voice. 3 Why should you be discouraged, O heirs of special Grace, For goodly is your Heritage, and pleasant is your place! 4 What e'r discouragments you find, our Christ can answer all; His Arms are ready to lift up when you are near to fall. 5 You have had a sweet taste of God, he is to you most dear; You feel the power of his Word, be therefore of good Chear!

O cleanse my heart within From evil Thoughts; and keep thou me from all presumptious Sin! 3 O let not sin have power to reign in me at any time; And so shall I be free from stain, and 'scape the greatest crime! 4 Blessed, O blessed, are the Pure, who Pure are still in Heart, That keep thy Testimonies sure, and from all sin depart. 5 They're such that cause have to rejoyce, thy Praises forth to sing; And unto them new comforts shall from thee, Lord, daily spring: 6 They pardon'd are, and in thy Love do evermore remain; They born are also from above, and shall with Jesus reign. HYMM 34. The Backslider healed: Or, Mercy for Backsliders. 1 Believers now, what have you more, what have you more to do; But to sing Praise to God on high from whom your help doth flow? 2 Lord thou art Good, thy Mercy's great, thy Promises most sure; Salvation 'tis which thou hast wrought, Christ's blood did it procure. 3 Exalt by Faith your Lord on high, through off your Unbelief; And trust in Christ continually, in whom is your Relief: 4 Say there is hope, and we do come, we come, O Lord, to thee; For thou alone, Lord, art our God; thy Name Exalted be! 5 Backsliders then return and sing, God will forgive you all; And make you so firmly to stand that you shall never fall. HYMN 35. Ephraim mixed among the People. 1 The Pure in heart are thy delight O thou most holy One! All they that do what things are right may sing thy Praise alone. 2 All mixtures, Lord, in Doctrin and Practice, thou dost hate; Ourselves, therefore, with wicked Men let's not associate! 3 And so shall we, Lord, with much joy our hearts lift up to Thee; And nothing shall our Peace destroy whilst circumspect we be, 4 Let such that mingle not themselves thy Praises therefore sing; And to thy People let men join in Faith, to Praise our King. 5 Come out of Babel then all ye, and be ye seperate; Depart all Godly ones, and flee before it is too Late! 6 O touch not the Polluted thing, and God will own you then; And drink you shall of his sweet Spring; thus sing, and say, Amen. HYMN 36. The good Samaritan. 1 Sinners rejoyce who wounded be, your blest Physician's near; His Oyl will heal his Wine will cheer, our Sickness he did bear: 2 'Tis Jesus Praise that we will raise, and set his Glory forth; There's none like thee, all Saints do see, in Heaven or on Earth. 3 Thy Blood's our balm, who hither came to Die upon the Tree! Therefore, O Lord, with one accord we will sing Praise to thee. 4 Thou hast a Salve for every sore; didst Dye that we might Live Therefore to thee continually all Praises we will give. HYMN 37. The voice of the Turtle heard in our Land. 1 Thy precious Blood was shed, O Lord, my soul to purge from Sin; Which purchas'd Grace my soul to change, when shall this work begin: 2 In sinners hearts, O now impart, that Grace that they may sing: O own thy word, most holy Lord, our God, and gracious King! 3 The harmless Turtle's pleasant voice is heard, Lord, in this place; Let Fig-trees put forth their green Figs, young Converts deck with Grace. 4 Arouse! the Summer will soon pass, your day of grace will end; O come to Christ, whilst he doth call, and does his love commend! 5 See how the Saints do bud in Grace, what gracious fruits abound, Upon this liberty for all to hear the joyful sound: 6 Arise, you who yet sleep in Sin, make hast to come and live; So shall you sing and joyful be, and honour to Christ give. HYMN 38. —Buy of me. 1 Come buy of thee? Lord let us see what 'tis that thou dost sell! The Pearl of Price and Paradice, O Lord what Tongue can tell 2 What their worth are! what Fool is there who doth refuse to buy? A bargain's here! and 'twill appear so to Eternity. 3 This Pearl excells the rich Beryl, the Onyx and the Sapphire; Rubies so rare can't with't compare, no, nor the gold of Ophir! 4 Begone vile Lusts as things accurst, let every Soul then say, This Pearl will I purchase and buy without further delay? 5 Let's look about, our Glass runs out, and take such good Advice; What e'r you see the terms to be, to come unto the Price. 6 Sing, Sing, God's Praise, you ought always, who this rich Pearl have; What would you be, what more can ye ask, seek, desire, or crave? HYMN 39. A Bleeding Christ, and the Bleeding Heart. 1 How gracious and how good, O Lord, art thou to Sinners vile; Thy Wrath is o'r, and thou on us, in Jesus Christ, doth smile? 2 Sing Praise ye tender-hearted ones, lift up God's Praise on high; For you shall live for evermore, yea, live and never die. 3 Behold a bleeding Christ! O see his side, how did it run With purple Gore? Can ye forbear to grieve, shed tears, and mourn! 4 But did he die, and in our stead, that we might never die? O love this Lord, and sing his Praise; and on him all rely! 5 The fruits of Christ's most blessed Death in bleeding Hearts appear; Their sins, they see, have wounded him, and pierc'd him like a spear. 6 They look to him, therefore they mourn, and yet by Faith rejoyce; They cann't but grieve, nor yet forbear to sing with cheerful Voice. HYMN 40. Salvation great and Glorious. 1 Great God of Love send from above thy new Jerusalem; On Jesus's Head cause thou to spread his sparkling Diadem. 2 Hosannah sing continually, our Jesus comes apace; Bow every Knee; all Hell shall flee from th'terror of his Face. 3 Salvation high is now come nigh, salvation great indeed; O Sinners see and Saved be by Jesus who did bleed! 4 Here's Lise for you that believe do, the terms most easy are; O come and Drink before you sink i'th' depths of Hell's dispair. 5 Sing Praise, sing Praise, God's honour raise, ye who salvation have; Dear Jesus love, who from above came, your poor Souls to Save: 6 Now Heavens work is here begun, the work of singing Praise; Most holy live, rejoyce and sing until you end your days. HYMN 41. The Tender Hearts Triumph. 1 You tender-Hearted souls rejoyce, and sing God's Praises forth; In sacred Hymns lift up your Voice whilst here you live on Earth: 2 For God bestowed hath on such new Covenant true Grace; And though they grieve and sorrow much, they shall lift up their Face. 3 'Tis a new Spirit that's in you, your heart of Stone is gone; The bleeding heart shall sweetly sing when this sad Life is done. 4 Sin unto you most grievous is, you cannot it endure; O is it thus! then sing God's Praise, for you shall sing for ever. HYMN 42. The broken and contrite Heart. 1 What cause of Joy ye Saints is here? have you a tender heart? Lift up your heads, be of good Cheer, you have a blessed part! 2 O Lord, we praise thy holy Name, for offering precious Grace; Let us believe, so let us sing, for happy is our case: 3 Thy Word can break a heart of Stone; O lay on gracious Blows, To Sinners, and also to Saints, let's see what Mercies flows. 4 A broken heart's a sacrifice most choice, O Lord, to thee A broken Christ, and broken hearts, most sweetly do agree. 5 Thou wilt, Lord, dwell with Contrite ones, and them revive also; Upon the humble sincere Soul all lasting blessings flow. HYMN 43. Righteousness of Christ Glorious 1 Christ's Righteousness imputed is, to those who do believe; Sing Praise to Christ, and God on high, who do this Grace receive. 2 Your wedding garment is a sign of Joy and sweet Delight. Sing praise, O Soul, for thou art his, sing praise both Day and Night. 3 In this may Saints rejoyce always, 'tis this doth make them glad; Such may rejoyce well all their dayes who are so bravely clad. 4 Your wedding Robes they are, O know, richly Embroidered; No Princess was e'er cloathed so, that King did ever wed. 5 It shines bespangled with Gold; and such who have it on The King with joy doth them behold, and loves to look upon. 6 How may we then continually in Jesus Christ rejoyce, And sing to him melodiously, with Heart and cheerful Voice?

HYMN 45. The Blessed Death of the Saints: Sung at the Funeral of that Vertuous Gentlewoman, Mrs. ELIZABETH BRIGHT; Decemb. 7th. 1693/4. 1 Thy Word, O Lord, doth comfort those who on thee do Believe; Yea, all of them which thou hast chose thy quick'ning Grace receive: 2 In Life it is a Cordial sweet, at Death it doth revive; Such Comforts do thy Saints meet with, of which, Death can't deprive. 3 A Door of Bliss to weary Saints, thou art (grim Death) become; Secured is the Jewel safe, whilst Earth the Corps intombs. 4 By Death the Saints do enter Rest, prepar'd ready above; They are for ever swallow'd up in endless Joys and Love. 5 Cease grieving then for such who are to blessed Jesus gone: For they in Glory shine most bright, and the blest Prize have won, HYMN 46.

HYMN 47. Psal. 17. 15.—I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy Likeness. Sung at the Funeral of Mrs. SARAH WILMOT, July 14th, 1694. 1 Sing to the Lord, ye Saints of his, and thankfully express How sweet the due remembrance is of His pure Holiness: 2 And tho' his Anger burns apace it quickly slacks again; But, Lord, thy Favour and thy Grace for ever doth remain. 3 Tho' Sorrows lodge with us all Night, which makes us Weep and Mourn, Yet Joy comes in at Morning Light, and makes a Sweet return. 4 By Death thy Saints enter to joys prepar'd for them above; And the're for ever shall remain in endless Life and Love. 5 O there they see as they are seen, with clear unclouded views! O there they hear Lord! nothing else but sweet and Glorious News! 6 Anthems of Joy, of Love, and Praise; and Hallelujahs sing; Who would be fond of this vain World, from whence such Sorrows spring? 7 We shall be fully satisfied when we awake and rise: If we do Sleep in Jesus Christ we then shall win the Prize. HYMN 48. Salvation Shining. 1 O sing ye now unto the Lord, a new and pleasant Song; For he hath wrought by his Right Hand; to him doth Praise belong. 2 Salvation is, Lord, wrought by Thee, from Sin from Wrath and Hell; O sing to God continually, all who in Sion dwell! 3 'Tis thee, O Lord, we will exalt, and spread thy Glory forth. For thy Right Hand hast Wonders done For us, who dwell on Earth: 4 Our Enemies that are within, thou hast, O Lord, brought down; Our Foes also, that are without, by Thee, are overthrown. 5 Ye Righteous in the Lord rejoyce, his Holiness proclaim; Be thankful, and with Heart and Voice sing to his glorious Name: 6 For why, the Lord our God is good, and he has heard our cry? Since on our side, Lord thou hast stood, let's praise thee till we Die. HYMN 49. The Saints Holy Triumph. 1 Tremble all you who rest upon a Form of Godliness; As also ye that do draw back, whether 'tis more or less: 2 Rejoyce ye Saints and do not fear you all are in Christ's hand; There's not a Soul that is Sincere but firmly it doth stand. 3 Upon a Rock, and ne'er shall move, nor fall away; Besure Gods own Elect, who do him love, all trials shall endure. 4 Come Saints, Triumph, in the dear Lamb, your Lord, that once did Die; We that Believe in Jesus, have e'erlasting cause of joy. 5 Come Law of God, what hast thou now of us for to demand? Thy Curses all did meet in Christ; who in our stead did stand: 6 Tho' such do Sin thou canst not Curse, thy Curses all did ly Upon our bleeding Lord, when he, our Sacrifice, did die? 7 Come Justice, where is now thy Charge; what hast thou now to show? We do to thee present the blood which from Christ's sides did flow: 8 We shall not fall who do believe; well may such sing; therefore Draw back they can't so as to Die; sing Praise for evermore. HYMN 50. The Power of God's Word. 1 O Lord, 'tis matter of high Praise thy Word on us doth shine; But Happy they who fee! it's rays, and glorious Power Divine. 2 O let poor Sinners feel their Sin prick them, as with a sword; And Purge out all that Filth within; so will we praise thy Word. 3 Enlightened Souls have cause to sing, who Wounded were by thee; True cause of joy to such doth spring; for they, Lord, He aled be; 4 And now in Robes, most richly deckt, they to the King are brought; Surpassing Angels; for have they a Robe so richly Wrought. 5 We therefore throw our Crowns below thy High and Glorious Throne; And must all say, both Night and Day, thou Worthy art alone, 6 All Glory, Pow'r, and Praise to have, by us for evermore; Thus let us Sing unto our King, and him in Heart adore. HYMN 51. Boundless Mercy. 25th Psalm Tune. 1 Of Mercy still, O Lord, We will together Sing; And in sweet sacred Songs of Praise Exalt our glorious King: 2 Let Heart and Tongue rejoyce, And say, Who's like to Thee? Among the gods there's none that Thus Forgives Iniquity. 3 We did not Pardon crave, When in our Blood we lay; But t'was free Grace that moved Thee Our cursed Debts to pay. 4 This Pardon is this Day To sinners Offered; Oh! is there none that will come in, Whilst out thy Hands are spread! 5 You Happy are, O Souls, Who now forgiven be; And also over a short time You will it clearly see: 6 Then Sing, tho' in the Dust You ly a little while; A Day is near that will make all God's pardon'd Ones to smile. HYMN 52. A Call to Obedience. 1 Thine Ordinances are, O Lord, like Pipes that run with Wine; We praise Thee now with one accord, for each Command of Thine. 2 Repent! Lord that's a mighty thing; but all who do not so, Thou down to Hell at last will bring, thy Wrath to undergo. 3 Believe! and shall we saved be? O Blessed be thy Name! For works can't not us justifie, since Sinners we became. 4 Baptized be! Lord, some we fear do not of that approve; But such who are indeed Sincere, and truly do Thee Love, 5 Will do whatever Thou dost say; each Precept, Lord, is right; And That which some do loathe and hate, is Lovely in thy Sight. HYMN 53. Spiritual Joy increasing. 1 Rejoyce ye that in Houses dwell, in Houses made of Clay, For Bodies of the Saints excell; and shall another Day: 2 Lord shew unto thy Servants all thy Favour and thy Grace; And let us all both Great and Small Behold thy glorious Face. 3 O put great joy into our Hearts, so will we sing to Thee: And cause have more than those whose Corn and Wines increased be: 4 Sing to the Lord in Righteousness, his face do you behold; In Christ, God doth you richly Bless with Blessings manifold. 5 God is your God, you Union have through Christ, with him again; Your Bodies and your Souls are his, so ever shall remain: 6 Some joy in Wealth, and others do in Pleasures much abound; But such alone have cause of joy that have Gods favour found. HYMN 54. Christ our Glorious Shepheard. 1 Now let us to our Shepheard sing; the Shepheard of the Sheep; Blessed are they, O Happy Souls, whom thou, Lord, Christ, doth keep: 2 And will you then go still astray, O see the Shepheard's come, He's come to seek, to search and find, and convoy you all Home. 3 He looks about to see if he can find you in his fold; Can you forbear for to return, how can your Love be cold? 4 Ah! he for you did shed his blood, he for his Sheep did Die! And will you, Souls, your dearest Lord again now Crucifie! 5 Besides, the Wolves are got abroad; O hear your Shepheard's Voice! O Sing unto your blessed Lord, and in him all rejoyce: 6 Thou art our Shepheard and our Guide. our Prophet, Priest and King, Thou art our Life, our Light our Hope, from thee, our joys do Spring. 7 Then Ravish'd with thy Sacred Love, let us thy Glory raise; And mount our Souls to Heaven above, in Songs of lasting Praise; 8 And hate to mind a Strangers Voice, thy Doctrine let us hear, That we with thee may all rejoyce, when thou, Lord, shalt appear. HYMN 55. Truth in its Primitive Purity. Sung at the Administration of Baptism. 1 Now let us make a joyful Noise, and sing unto the Lord; And in God's Fear unite our Joys, in him with one accord. 2 O blessed Day, in which we see God's Ordinance restor'd! Worthy art thou, O holy One, to be in Truth ador'd. 3 Dark Clouds of Error God expells, and Truth shines splendently: O may our Brethren be convinc'd, give them a seeing Eye: 4 You that Believers are, arise, and all Baptized be; Take heed you do not still dispise Christ's Holy Baptisme. 5 And let us all thy Name, O Lord, for evermore adore; That thy blest Institutions are restor'd as heretofore. 6 If every Truth, Lord, be by us receiv'd in sincere Love, It will to us an Evidence be, we born are from above. HYMN 56. The Spiritual Bridegroom. Sung at the Administration of Baptism. 1 How pleasant is it, for to see poor Sinners to espouse Their dearest Lord, who only is, the Blessed Sharons Rose. 2 'Tis thou, Lord Jesus, we do Preach, and thy high Praises sing; Thou art our All, all Grace's from thee; and spiritual Blessings spring. 3 O who is like, Lord, unto Thee, thy Beauty doth exceed; Thy Glory is so infinite; in Thee's all things we need: 4 There's none thy Glory can set forth, yet thou dost condescend To be the Bridegroom of our Souls, our Joy, our God, our Friend. 5 Be thou to us above all things; Chief of ten Thousand be; Let those enamouring Lips of thine, endear our Souls to Thee: 6 O let thy Saints be ravished with Love begetting Love; Fill'd with eternal Joys Divine, which flow down from above! 7 O then with Angels sing the Praise of your most sacred Friend: The Glory of Christ Jesus raise, until your Days shall end. HYMN 57. God's Temple Plants. 25th Psalm Tune. 1 Ye Sinners now come in, Christ doth invite you all; Return, return, make Angels sing, Return for Christ doth call: 2 Lord, thou art Merciful, Most ready to forgive, And Pardon all that come to Thee, And do thy Son receive. 3 O leave your wicked Ways Before it be too Late; For those that love, and live in Sin, God's Soul doth loathe and hate: 4 But like a Cedar Tree, Which Lebanon forth brings, The Just shall grow and flourish so As laden Palm-Tree springs. 5 God's Temple Plants shall thrive, In his blest Courts each one; And still produce their fruitful juice, When they to Age are grown: 6 Still Fat and flourish shall, God's Justice to express; Our Rock is he, most pure and free From all Unrighteousness. 7 Then sing his Praises forth, Him Honour and Adore; For you shall sing unto your King In Glory evermore. HYMN 58. Christ's Vine-yard. 1 Thy Vine-yard, Lord, was purchased, though wild it once did ly, And Barren was as any Ground thou couldst on Earth espy; 2 But thou much cost and pains hast shewn, that it might fruitful be. Thy Sun doth shine, and Rain doth fall on it continually. 3 All Praise therefore to God on High, how great is thy blest Care Of thy Own Church, and every Soul who truly are sincere. 5 We will the Praises of the Lord in sacred Hymns set forth; And sing therefore with one accord, whilst we do live on Earth, HYMN 59.

HYMN 60. Redeeming Love. 1 O that we could as Angels do aloud God's Praises sing, For Wonders of Redeeming Love, from whence Soul Peace doth spring. 2 Shall Man, who at the Gates of Hell did Pale and Speechless ly, Not find a Tongue, and time to Speak? Stones against such will Cry? 3 Then ye, th'Redeemed of the Lord, your thankful Voices raise; Who Reconciled are to God; sing your Redeemers Praise: 4 Sing and Triumph in boundless Grace, which thus hath Set you Free; Exalt, with shouts, all who Believe, your God continually. HYMN 61. Spiritual Food. 1 Our Souls O Lord, think thou upon, let us not them forget; But cloathe them, O most holy One, and give them precious Meat: 2 Thou hast thought on our Souls, we know, when they in Blood did ly, For which we praise thy Holy Name, and will thee magnify. 3 How Good art thou, to us, O Lord, what plenteous Food have we; Our Paths drop Fatness, therefore we'll sing praises unto Thee. 4 Put us, O Lord in Remembrance the Needful thing to do; That Satan may never prevail, nor work our Overthrow. HYMN 62. The Honour of Christ's Servants. 1 Ye Servants of the Lord of Hosts who in his Vine-yard be; Who wait on him, and do his work, Praise him continually: 2 Your honour, O it is not small, if you accepted are; And Servants be, then you are all both Sons, and Daughters fair. 3 Nay he Espoused hath you too, and in his Bosome will Lay you to all Eternity, your Souls with joy to fill. 4 O Then Sinners, yield now come in, Christ's Servants to become; So shall you have all Crowns at last, and shine in his Kingdom. 5 The Praises of this, Lord, let us with joyful Hearts sing forth; For there is none like unto him in Heaven nor on Earth.

HYMN 64. —But they said, There is no Hope. 1 Lord, of thy Mercy we will sing, thy Mercy hath no bound; They that have said, There is no Hope, thy Mercy sweet have found. 2 Sinners break forth, and in amaze, do you Rejoyce, and say, There's Hope, that we may Mercy find, believe, and do not stay. 3 O Lord, thou dost not look that Men should Worthiness obtain: Or some inherent fitness get, much less be Born again, 4 Before that they take hold on Thee, but presently Believe; And on thy Promise lay fast hold, and Christ strait-way receive. 5 Glory to God, Glory to Christ, let Sinners say no more, There is no Hope; let all Believe, and thy free Grace adore.

HYMN 69. The Ax lifted up: Or, Wrath Pursuing the Sinner. 1 O Lord, thou Just and Holy One, wee the Admire do, That Fruitless Trees are not cut down; this doth thy Mercy show: 2 Thy Ax is up, O let us fear, for thou most Righteous art, The natural branches did'st not spare; therefore with trembling Heart 3 Let sinners now to Jesus fly, that grafted they may be In him, by Faith, most speedily; no other way can we 4 Find out, for to escape thy Wrath; and blessed be thy Name, That ever Jesus, out of Love, to Save us, hither came. 5 O let us all good Trees be found, and fruitful also be; Make thou our Hearts Sincere and Sound, and we'll rejoyce in Thee; 6 And sing thy Praise, O Lord, most High, for we have Blessings store; Help us dear God, our Wants supply, and we'll sing Evermore.

HYMN 73. Hell in a Rage: Sung at the Administration of Baptism. 1 Lift up your voice, sing and rejoyce, where are your melting tears; Do Sinners turn, and to Christ run, this fills Satan with Fears; 2 This makes Hell sad, and Heaven glad, the Cherubs claps their wings; There's joy above to see what Love is in the King of Kings. 3 To such as we that Chosen be, and called by his Grace; Who Nat'rally in filth did ly, condemn'd with Adam's Race, 4 But now made near and sav'd from fear, being rais'd up on high; Wash'd in Christ's Blood, enjoying Good; sing Praise continually. 5 Lord let these know, and away go assured of thy Love: And live each Day that all may say, they Born are from above: 6 That we may see continually, cause to rejoyce in them, Who being Sincere, may each appear with Christ, Amen, Amen. HYMN 74. Jacob's Ladder, a Type of Christ. 1 Behold, and Wonder now, in a most sacred Song; O let's Exalt the Name of Christ, to him doth Praise belong. 2 A Wonder sure it was, and that in every part; Eor while he lay ith' Virgins Womb he lay in her own Heart. 3 That Son the Mother bore, the Mother did Create; Both perfect God, and perfect Man, a Wonder to Relate. 4 Lord Christ, thou art the Priest, and yet the Sacrifice: The Altar too art thou likewise, and Gift that Sanctifies. 5 Thou God-Man, King, and Priest, Almighty art yet Meek; Thou art most Just yet Merciful, the guilty cam'st to seek. 6 Thou never any fail'd, that sought thee in their need; Thou never quencht the smoking Flax, nor broke the bruised Reed. 7 Thy Life a wonder was; but here's a wonder more, That thou that didst all Kingdoms make, shouldst make thy self so Poor. 8 And wonderful it is, [that we this thing do see,] That thou, who art all Life and Love, yet few, alass! Love Thee. HYMN 75. The Wonder of Pardoning Grace. 1 Come stand and wonder every one, the way that God hath found To Pardon us, it is such Grace, that strongly doth abound. 2 O let us of thy goodness sing, thy goodness let's adore; And with thy Grace exalt our King, and Saviour, evermore. 3 No Pardon, Lord, without thy Blood, for us, be poured out; By thy Atonement, Lord, thou hast our Pardon brought about: 4 Our Surety for us did Die, O blessed be thy Name! Let Saints Praise Thee with one accord, yea, highest Praise proclaim. 5 Sinners, your Pardon ready is, O fall at Jesus's feet; Believe on him, and you shall have his Pardoning Mercy sweet! 6 O let us say, O Lord, Who is it that's like unto Thee? Who Pardons all our horrid Sins, yea, all Iniquity. HYMN 76. —I will put a new Spirit within you: Or, The Unwearied Saint. 1 O blessed Lord, what hast thou done? what kind of Spirit's this, That makes thy Saints with joy to run, and thy sweet Lips to Kiss? 2 How heavy and how dull are they, (how dead and carnal too;) Who in the Old Nature do abide, they nothing freely do. 3 Thy Saints are fired with thy Love, they in thy ways rejoyce; And upwards they to thee do move, and sing with cheerful Voice. 4 Thy acceptation, Lord, of us, thy Love and Favour kind, Is Wages now enough for us; this Blessing let us find. 5 And we will Praise thy Holy Name, and sing continually; And of thy Ways ne'er weary be, until we come to Die. HYMN 77. God's Court, or, Glory near. 1 O all ye Nations on the Earth, praise ye the Lord always; And all the People every where, set forth his glorious Praise. 2 For great his Goodness is to us, his Truth it does endure; Wherefore Praise ye the Lord our God, praise him ye Saints for e'vr. 3 Ye who attend God's holy Courts, and in his House do dwell. Sing forth his Praise ev'n all your days, bless him with Israel. 4 You'll quickly hear the Lord doth reign, look up, and ready be; Sion's in Travail, and ye shall her blest Deliverance see. HYMN 78. God Pardons, Guides, and Leads. 1 Sing Praise ye Saints, ye pardon'd Ones your Debts forgiven are, For Christ hath Paid all you did Owe, sing Praise for evermore. 2 O Sinners fly with speed to Christ, God's Wrath in him is o'er, Take hold of him and you shall sing sweet Praise for evermore. 3 And let the Saints rejoyce in God, who cancels all their Score: Who heals all our Infirmities, and doth our Souls restore. 4 'Tis he that leads, 'tis he that guides, and gives us Rest and Peace; O sing Christ's Praise, you pardon'd Ones, your joy shall never cease! HYMN 79. A Call to Young-Men. 1 Christ's Trumpet sounds yet once again, to bring poor sinners in; 'Tis Voluntiers he would obtain, to fight against their Sin. 2 And faithful Laborours he likewise, is come to seek and call: Young Men, will you not now arise and enter's Vine-yard all. 3 Christ worthy is, his Service too, will raise you very high; His Wages is a Crown of Life, his Servants never Die. 4 O then desert and come away, you serve a cruel Foe; Desert his service now this Day, and unto JESUS go! 5 When any come, the Angels sing, it causes joy above; All such who come may also sing, for they enjoy his Love. HYMN 80. Unity of Saints. 1 Unite our hearts unto thy self, O Lord, we do thee pray, So will we sing thy Praises forth, and walk with joy each day. 2 Thy Saints above united be, they sing with one accord; O let us with one Heart and Voice sing to the living Lord! 3 Singing together clearly shews, thy People should one be; For Union's a most lovely thing, unite us all to Thee! 4 And in thy Truth and bonds of Love, let us all live together In Unity, so will we sing thy Praises, now and ever. HYMN 82. The joy of Repenting Tears. 1 Thy ways, O Lord, most pleasant be, and all thy Paths are Peace; The joys of all that cleave to Thee, shall never, never, cease. 2 What are all sinful Pleasures here, which are sinners delight? Will they not hateful all appear when sin is in their sight? 3 More joy is there in leaving it, and in Repenting Tears; Then they do find who it commit, who filled are with fears. 4 O Young-Men, Young-Men, will you then Christ's gracious Call Obey? Now hear his Voice, I say again, no longer do delay! 5 All Praise to God, thus let us say and sing continually; Who says to sinners, Hear and Live: Believe and, do not Die. HYMN 83. The Saints Holy Triumph in Christ. 1 Come lets Triumph in the dear Lamb, our Lord, who once did Die; We that believe in Jesus, shall have everlasting joy. 2 Come Law of God, what hast thou now of Saints for to demand? Thy Curses all did meet in Christ, who did our Surety stand? 3 Come Justice, where is now thy Charge? what hast thou now to shew? We do to thee present the Blood that from Christ's sides did flow: 4 O blessed Wisdom infinite, 'tis thou hast done the thing; Justice and Mercy now are join'd, by our most blessed King! 5 But woe to such who slight this Grace, Salvation to neglect; God's Attributes with angry face will them at last reject: 6 But Saints shall Hallelujahs sing, because they are set free; Their Crowns they throw, Lord, at thy feet, and will give Praise to Thee. HYMN 84. Christ a Believers All: To be Sung at the Lord's-Supper. 1 Now unto Jesus Christ let's sing, before him let us fall; He that did our Salvation bring, ev'n he is All in All. 2 Thou art, bless'd One, the Lord of Lords, thou art the King of Kings, Tho art the Sun of Righteousness, with Healing in thy Wings. 3 Thou art our Meat, thou art our Drink, our Physick and our Health, Our Light, our Strength, our Joy and Crown, our Glory, and our Wealth: 4 To Thee let us give all the Praise, thy Glory not divide, For God did thee to Glory raise, to pull down all Mans Pride. 5 Salvation is in Thee alone, which is a thing not small: Pardon and Peace, and Life's in Thee, O thou art All in All! 6 What is there more, what can we say, but in the great'st amaze, Even stand and think, and evermore sing forth thy Glorious Praise?

Thus my dear Lord doth speak, If thou wouldst know what thou must do, And with my Saints partake; 2 Go up to yonder Mount, Thence look, and thou shalt 'spy, Clear as the Sun, what must be done, Presented to thine Eye? 3 Seest thou that Folded Flock, Whose Heart the Spirit tyes; Whom Gospel-Order calls into Distinct Societies? 4 Seest thou the Pastures where They do together Feed; The Shepheard stands with both his Hands To give them all they Need? 5 Their Magna-Charta is My Word; that is thy Guide; O follow them that follow Me, And thy Foot ne'er shall slide! 6 Thither I'll go, and join, There will I Feast and Feed; There will I sing my Shepheard's Praise, Who doth supply my Need! HYMN 86. —My beloved is mine. Sung at the Receiving of the Lord's-Supper. 1 O blessed Day when we can say, Lord Jesus thou art mine! O Blessed Day when we can say, Lord Jesus I am thine! 2 Christ he is ours by Deed of Gift, and that's a Title good; And Saints are his by Purchase Right, he Bought them with his Blood. 3 Say then, I'll have no Love but he, I like my Choice so well; And for his Spouse he will have Me, together let us Dwell. 4 He feeds among the Lillies White, there he doth most frequent; Amongst his Saints is his delight, to smell their fragrant Scent. 5 Their Graces are his sweet Repast, their Prayers and Praises are A Banquet to him and their Faith, is his delicious Fare. 6 O Let but Me and this Church be, a garden of delight; To thee Lord, and with one accord, we'll Praise thee Day and Night. HYMN 87. A Hymn of Praise for the New-birth. 1 You that are born again rejoyce, and sing God's Praises forth; With one accord lift up your Voice, who experience the new Birth: 2 And you that are not yet renew'd, have cause to sing also; Because God doth afford the means, through which this Grace doth flow. 3 But none sweet Music truly make, in God's most holy Ear, But such who do thy Grace partake, and truly changed are. 4 O Tremble then, and take good Heed, rejoyce with holy Dread; Lord whilst we live let's sing thy Praise, and do it as we read! 5 Ev'n sing with Grace in all our Hearts, and with thy Spirit too, Do thou inrich our inward parts, that we thy Praise may shew.

A Hymn on Preparation for Ordinances. 1 'Tis thou, O God, that must prepare our Hearts, we therefore cry, Cleanse us from every Sin and Spot; O purge Iniquity! 2 That we may hear and sing to Thee; so as with thee to meet; And find thy Word and Ordinance to us exceeding sweet. 3 That so we may in thee rejoyce, and thy great Name adore; And filled be with inward Peace, and Praise thee evermore. 4 With Faith and Holy Diligence, let us attend thy Word; That cause we may have still to sing unto our blessed Lord. HYMN 66. Saints happy at Death. Sung at the Funeral of Mr. JOHN LOYNS, June the 26th. 1692. Who (to the great Grief of his Godly Friends) was accidentally Drowned in the River of Thames. 1 The Length of all our Life and Age, O Lord, is in thy hand; And we must go when thou dost call, and yield to thy Command. 2 Our days are few, and pass away, like as a shadow flys; Let's ready be, O Lord we pray, and shun all Vanities. 3 When we go out of our own Doors, none knows what may befall, Or come on us, e'er we return; Life's uncertain to all. 4 O call to Mind, remember then, our Time consumeth fast; Why hast thou made the Sons of Men, as things in vain to waste? 5 What Man is he that Liveth here, and Death shall never see? Or, from the hand of the dark Grave, can, Lord, deliver'd be? 6 But blest are they, who die in Christ, their Death to them is Gain; Their Souls do go to Paradice; the Wicked go to Pain. 7 Praised be God for Jesus Christ, who gives such Victory Unto thy Saints, o'er Sin and Death; sing Praise continually. 8 The Godly ly in a sweet Sleep, they sleep in Jesus do; And no more Pain, nor Sorrow shall for ever undergo. HYMN 90. Saints the Salt of the Earth. 1 If Saints, O Lord, do Season all amongst whom they do Live, Salt all with Grace, both Great and Small they may Sweet Relish give; 2 And blessed be thy glorious Name, in England Salt is found; Some Savoury Souls who do Proclaim thy Grace, which doth abound. 3 But O the want of Salt, O Lord, how few are Salted well; How few are like to Salt indeed, Salt thou thy Israel! 4 Now sing ye Saints who are this Salt, and let all Season'd be With your most Holy Gracious Lives; great need of it we see. 5 The Earth will else Corrupt and Stink O Salt it well therefore, And Live to him that Salted you, and sing for evermore. HYMN 91. —He is altogether Lovely. 25th Psalm Tune. 1 The gracious Words that drop From Christ's sweet Mouth so free, Are sweeter than the sweetest Myrrh, To all that do Love Thee. 2 In short, This is the Man, He's altogether Love; Yea, altogether Lovely's he To whom my Soul doth move! 3 You Daughters this is he, This my Beloved is? No Tongue can tell, no Language can Express that Love of his! 4 The Drops that fill the Seas, Go, count them every one? Then join the number, if you please, Of Stars till there is none? 5 To these, the Sands, the Hairs, And all things else in sight; Hyperbolize Immensity, And run to Infinite? 6 This my Beloved is, He is the total sum Of all Perfections, and the Bliss Of all that to him come. 7 Then sing his Praise, and say, Thou dost excell all Men; Thou fairer art than ten Thousand; Hallelujah. Amen. HYMN 92. The Rose of Sharon. 1 Sharon the Garden of the World, the Pride of Palestine; Whose Natural soyl more Glory bore than Solomon could resign; 2 Could ne'er produce so sweet a Rose as I will be to Thee. So fair a Lilly never grew, Sharon must stoop to Me. 3 O Blessed Jesus, dost thou say, who'll have a Rose so sweet! Who will refuse our Sharons Rose, that knows its fragrant scent? 4 Upon the Cross thou was Distill'd, we taste in Distillation, The sweetness of the absent Rose, by Faith and Acceptation. 5 Thou art a Rose, my Soul's repose, O let me never be, My Dearest Lord, a Thorn to thee, who art so sweet to me. 6 Thou art the Lilly of the Vale, a matchless Purity. And I will sing thy Praise since thou dost in my Bosom ly. HYMN 93. Cant. 5. 12.—His Eyes are like the Eyes of Doves. 1 I'll tell you farther, that if such A Person you shall see, Whose Eyes like Doves are wash't with Milk and Water this is he? 2 He hath a killing Eye, 'twill Pierce through Adamantine Ears; And wound a Rock but with a look, and melt it into Tears. 3 Eyes that are clear and fitly set, that can see all things past, And all things present and to come, as long as Time shall last: 4 Whose Eyes are Pure, Holy and Chast, never defil'd with Sin; That never was in the least Promp't to take foul Objects in. 5 If such a One you meet, whose Eyes like Flames, and Lamps of Fire Strikes Dead, and yet gives Life thereby, tis he that I desire? 6 This is the Man I seek, and praise, All-seeing, and All-Eye: Tell him, if such a one you meet, 'tis for his Love, I Die! HYMN 44.

HYMN 95. Beautiful on the Mountains: Or, A Ransome found. 1 How beautiful upon the Mount, are they that Peace proclaim, That unto Rebels offer Grace, in their great Masters Name. 2 That unto Captives do declare glad Tidings; and do tell To Sinners, there's a Ransom found, to save their Souls from Hell. Mr. D. 3 Who say to Saints, who interest have in Thee, their dearest Lord, Thou wilt them all for ever Save, such Grace thou dost afford: 4 Mount Sinai's fiery Law can't break a Heart that's like a stone; The Creature's Arrows at the Walls of Brass, in vain are thrown. 5 'Tis only Pardon that doth melt, and Love doth sinners draw: We therefore, Lord, will sing thy Praise; grace do's exceed the Law. 6 Those who are, Lord, united to thy self, in Faith and Love, May sing thy Praise on Earth, for they shall also sing above.
