      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. TO N. H. For Christmas, New Year, birthday, all in one, This book I bring to thee,âno fairy tale; Only strong love that turns the spirit pale Like flowers whose sweet hearts pale before the sun. Look gently on my passionate long work done, Eyes whose clear glances through the soul's rent mail Dart arrowlike. From underneath your veil Of dear black lashes let one tear-drop run! One tear to answer love that knows no bound! Well, that is something. And be sure of this O sweetest eyes that poet ever found, That unto me it has been speechless bliss To know, the while I wrote, what eyes would see Within this song the very soul of me. Nov. 30, 1883. II. RESURRECTION-LIGHT. Is there a Resurrection for the flowers? Have faded lilies seen their Christs arise Snow-petalled, golden-hearted,âwith clear eyes That frighten Death from out the tangled bowers? Have ferns and harebells their triumphant hours When they too know that Death is he who dies? When they revisit the sunlighted skies And meet again the soft lips of the showers?â Is there a Resurrection, love, for thee? Wilt thou whose eyes are even more divine Than the sun's first light gladdening the sea-line Be as the resurrection-sun for me? Will Christ speak through thee, and the eyes I meet First after death be even than his more sweet? IV. THE DEATH-WOUND. I am as one returning from the tilt Who smiles, the throngs of ladies sweet among, And answers laughing many a silvery tongue And dallieth with his still sword's golden hilt;â Who wanders now through many a bower love-built Where perhaps of old gay loves and dainty sung, And watches the green branches West-wind-swung, And hearkens to the brown-necked linnet's lilt:â And yet, for all these things, bright-hued and fairâ Though many a love laugh round me tender-eyed, And though old dreams with brown or golden hair Move through the green woods, and in alleys wide Old flowers and new flowers glisten,âyet I bear (I know) my death-wound deep within my side. VI. TITANIA'S SCEPTRE. Thou art a mortal maid for all thine eyes Are dark as some immortal maid's might be. The lips have kissed thee of our earthly sea, And thou hast won soft smiles from earthly skies And heard the West wind's amorous replies To green leaves dancing through the deep June-tree:â Yet, for all this, my soul doth worship thee As though thou wast enrobed in fairy-wise. Art thou a mortal? Hast thou trodden along Our London streets like others? I will make Thee Queen of fairyland within my song. Its mystic woods shall open for thy sake The barriers that for others are too strong, And thine hand shall Titania's sceptre take. VII. âI THINK OF THEE.â At any rate, O love, I think of thee.â What if the white light-hearted wandering foam That hath the whole waste for its passionate home Of blue broad strong interminable sea Thinks little more of this than thou of me! What if the ferns, wherethrough the sun's rays roam Fostering, are heedless as smooth fronds they comb Of their sun's warm and genial potency? It matters little. Back into the breast Of the deep sea the foam-bell falls at last, And, when the hot sun's chariot seeks the West, The sweet ferns' sweetest tenderest hours are past.â So wouldst thou through the world have walked in shade Had not song's sunlight round about thee played! X. FROM THE THEATRE TO THE COUNTRY. I long to see thee, London actress mine, No longer where the gaslights flame and flare, But where the pure sweet-scented country air Plays with green tender boughs of larch and pine. Had ever forest Dryad eyes like thine I wonder, or wood-nymph with leafy hair So sweet a smile?âFor thee the ferns prepare Their soft fresh scent, and the beech-leaves their shine. I long to see thee where the sunlight falls Upon some grassy bank which bees pervade, Or where some giant oak-tree casts deep shade, Or where the circling sea-mew curves and calls. Thine are not only the theatric boards, But also dew-kissed leaves and velvet swards. August 8, 1883. XII. âJUST AS THE SUN ATTACKS.â Just as the sun attacks with twenty million archers That o'er the heavenly road, indomitable marchers, Tread, on their fiery way; Just as the sun attacks,âyet one tree's leaves that quiver In the light summer wind can shield us and deliver And guard our foreheads from the solar ray:â Just as the vast sea-wind is powerless, if it meeteth One tamarisk-hedge, to harm the bellflower that retreateth Behind the thin green wall And resteth there as safe, it and the red carnations, As if no sea-wind sought with fierce fatigueless patience Upon its blue soft hanging bell to fall:â So suns and winds and storms are powerless now to harm me. The armies of the skies have no force to disarm me, Nor spears of pain and grief, If only thy white hand be raised to bid them tarry: Thou hast the eternal power the darts of pain to parry As the sun's darts glance off one single leaf. Just as the sun and wind pause at the frail leaves' warning So all time's armies pause when thou, time's pale self scorning, Dost step in front of me. Time, pain, grief, sorrow, deathâthese all thou hast the power To banish if they dare set foot within thy bower, As one bush hurls the sea-wind back to sea. XIII. A NEW MADONNA-FACE. I have not Raphael's art: I have but words,âin colour Than thy sweet rose-flushed cheek how infinitely duller!â I have my poet's pen: But never any brush of mighty genius-painter To show thee to the world,âah! even so far fainter Than the true image, never seen of men. Yet if the world learns not, in some degree, thy beauty, What has it lost! Ah! fate, if thou didst half thy duty Thou wouldst a Raphael bring That he might hand this face to future generations, A treasure for unborn Art-worshipping far nations. Raphael had colour-might. I only sing. A new Madonna-face thou hast. Our skies and waters See faces fair as those of old Italia's daughters Whose dark sweet pure eyes gleam For ever through the might of Raphael.âOld-world passion Would have adored thy face in ardent fiery fashion: Thou wouldst have made the soul of Titian dream. And now to-day, far-off from old-world love and wonder, I sing thee: and grim waves of seas and long years sunder Our souls from Italy. Yet thou hast given the world one more Madonna-glory; Gazing on no blue deep from Southern promontory, But from white English cliff on wild grey sea. XVI. CONTRASTS. The sudden change to calm smooth waters when the harbour Receives the weary boat: the restful green deep arbour After the dusty road: After the crowded street a lawn with elms upon it,â A band of music there, and many a dainty bonnet, And sweeter faces than the hot street showed: After the tossed white sea a pool of green still water Wherein some white-limbed nymph the great green oaktree's daughter Bathes with blue laughing eyes: After the fierce wild storm the blue sky pure and tender: After bronzed brows of men a woman's untanned splendour: After the night the royal red sunrise: After the weary day the night-time cool and gracious: After the city-walls a golden corn-field spacious Wherein red poppies gleam: Upon the Atlantic surge a lonely wave-tossed vessel Whose masts in the mad wind bend, shriek, and toil, and wrestle,â Yet in the cabin eyes where love-thoughts dream: These contrasts all are sweet:âYet sweeter than the sweetest It was when thou didst come, of all loves far the fleetest, The swiftest tenderest thing,â Contrasting with my past thine own ethereal brightness And with the black pain-cloud thy more than sea-bird's whiteness, As through yon rain-cloud flashes one white wing. XX. ART AND LOVE. Thy face is dear to Art, and it is worth Ten thousand common faces. When God sweeps With his death-wind that plunges through the deeps All common forms and vulgar from the earth Shall he not, hearing thy soft silvery mirth And watching the delicious dream that sleeps Upon thy lids, or through the lashes peeps, Spare thee,âas being indeed of heavenly birth? It cannot be that God will ever take Thee, love, from Art; for Art without thy face Would lose nine-tenths its beauty and its grace.â If not for Art's, then, God, for Love's own sake Spare her,âor Love will grasp Art's hand and be Twin-brother, weeping inconsolably. XXI. âTHIS TIME LAST YEAR.â This time last year I knew thee not. But now The heaven has opened, and thine eyes I meet. I reach a height the view wherefrom is sweet. I tread another august mountain-brow.â God, when he moulds a planet, knows not how The task will turn out, till it is complete: He knows not what fair leagues of golden wheat Or green grass will reward his labouring plough. He knows not what long lanes of leaves and flowers Wait all unseen, unsmelt, in front of him: What new sweet planetary marvellous hours; What golden eves, or pale-blue mornings dim: What summer pools fed by white cataracts' showers Where he may plunge each languid laughing limb. XXIV. THE AGE'S QUESTIONINGS. If God's heart were like man's, then thou wouldst never sorrow.â But that is just the point. Do we, God-moulding, borrow Robes of our own hearts' hue Wherewith to clothe the unknown and unexplained Creator? Is Nature lover of ours, or man's worst deadliest hater? Are there deep eyes behind the sky's deep blue? Because we love, we say that God must love. It follows? Because we love the bright red-chested blue-backed swallows And the king-fisher's sheen,â Because the summer light upon the mountains hoary Is sweet,âwe say that God displays therein his glory; The thought is high and comforting, I weenâ But is the fancy true? The coming years must settle.â Whether the beauty of God shines forth in white rose-petal And petal of red rose, Or whether flower and flower show forth their own selves merely; And whether, when we pray, we hear our own voice clearly But no God's-answer down the gold stair goes. O deadly perilous age, when dread and dubitation Assail all sacred hopes! When doubt and perturbation Invade all things that be! When for the robes of priests that once shone fair and pleasant Within the Church's walls, we have the omnipresent White foaming surplice-robes of Mystery's sea! We love and therefore God must love! We long to perish That those we love may live. Just so. So Christ must cherish The high design to die For the whole race,âGod longs to be the world's Redeemer Because each pure and true, large, noble-hearted dreamer Longs likewise,âWho made God long? You and I. Is God the shadow of man, not man the moulded creature? Did man make God alike in heart and form and feature And set his image there? When we cast prayer upon the deep, and think we find it, Doth the wave wash it back to which we first resigned it,â No answered yearningâjust the same old prayer? We often and often feelââThe cosmic heart is tender: None other than Love's heart could spread this cosmic splendour Of scarlet sunset-gleams Mixed with pale-blue and green and gentle lemon-colour Over the deep of sky. Clouds void of love were duller Surely?â We mix our own with cosmic dreams. âThe purple mountain-top the glory of God forthshoweth: Through the great sunrise-fire the flame of God's heart gloweth, And God's might in the sea Urges the blue and green translucid laughing breakers Across the flowerless floor. We, revelling, are partakers Surely in God's own resonant windy glee! âOur own deep love implies a deeper underneath it.â Our love is not enough. Large-hearted, we bequeath it To God, lest he run short. âOur love is shadow of God's,â we say: âOurs is the fountain Small, silver-voiced,âbut God's is the background of mountain Displaying behind the rill its stately port.â We long to live and live, for ever and for ever. âGod is too good,â we say, âthe thread of life to sever:â But are we very sure That, just because we love our life, and dread to quit it, A cosmic ear can hear our prayer, and will permit it? If no ear hears, what matter if prayer be pure!â If there be nought behind the splendid-winged red sunset To sympathize with man, what matter if prayer's onset With far more fiery wings Storm through the sunset-clouds? If no God rule the breakers, What are they, after all, but shepherdless mane-shakers? What are the clouds but stray unherded things? What is my love for thee, if no God heed nor hold it, But just a golden star loose on the heavens, unfolded, Swimming athwart the night? What is my passion if no God's face through the passion Gleams,âlifting, helping all, with infinite compassion,â Giving my love interminable might? And what art thou, O love, if no strong God deliver Thee from the shadow of death, but one more flower to quiver And tremble by life's stream Just for one passing hour, as other blossoms trembled And then death's sudden hand, that for that hour dissembled, Swept them to where his hungry green caves gleam? That is the awful doubt.âWhether our deepest yearning Hath aught to correspond in Nature ever turning Towards us her agelong gaze. Whether there be a soul of sympathy to reach usâ Or whether all the years, swift-passing, have to teach us Is summed up in their windy surface-ways. Springs, summers, autumns, springs,âred leaves and green and golden: White winters; springs again;âso hath it been from olden Far viewless days till this. Love, passion, failure, death. Dark eyes that make the laurel Coveted for their sake. Blue seas where crimson coral Yearns for the white-fringed sweet wave's Southern kiss. Dark Northern tides,âand thee,âand thy wave-silvery laughter.â But now that thou art born, what gift will follow after? Can God who brought thee, keep? Or must thou also pass? Is there no God to hold thee? Must in the end that same cold piteous silence fold thee In the same pale unintermittent sleep? XXV. THE ONE DEATHLESS WOMAN. What man of us believes that he will die? None surely.â When o'er the Western sky the golden clouds stream, purely Outspread before our gaze, Who dreams that there will come a day when bright as ever The clouds will kiss the sky,âyet his own soul will never Again steer joyous through sky-creeks and bays? Yes: all our friends may die. The dark-winged spirit may take them. The fragrance of the flowers,âthe sunlight,âmay forsake them: The streams may laugh to scorn Their clinging souls that strive with passionate adherence To linger in life:âthe waves with giant perseverance May slay the trembling keels across them borne. It matters not to us. We boldly claim exemption From this the lot of man,âdeliverance and redemption From death's fell arrow and dart. âSomehowââthe fancy goesââwe shall escape his arrows: Our boat will safely shoot along the white-lipped narrows:ââ So speaks the half conscious instinct in each heart. When the next century's skies with sunset-fires are blended, We surely shall be there to watch their flames extended Across the pale air-leagues: The thought that we shall pass is never grasped by mortal; To think that for ourselves will yawn the white death-portal Pains, and eludes the mind's grip, and fatigues. Surely thou shalt not die! For us the dream is baseless. But were not death of all high cosmic spirits most graceless If he should step anear! Can death assail the heart which only love should fetter? Will death's hand,ânot my hand,âwrite thee thy last love-letter? Would pale death whisper in a rose's ear? Oh, surely God will spare thy beauty and thy sweetness And send the foot of death with unexampled fleetness Some other road to take! There are so many and many whom if he took them, never Would Art or Life complain, or one song less for ever Delight the morning, sounding at daybreak. If Christ was spared, and took the upward road immortal: If at his tread sprang back the bolts that guard the portal Of deep dim purple sky: Why should not God spare thee as well, and let thee trample The vulgar head of death, just for one great example Of how one woman was too sweet to die? God might take one sea-bird, one flower,âand make this deathless. One sweet Christ-lily, or rose, when other flowers fall breathless Might ever immortal be:â God might make deathless, just for heaven's eternal pleasure And earth's, one woman fair in more than mortal measure: If so, God's choice would surely fall on thee. XXVI. THE MARVELLOUS NIGHT. This was the marvel of thee,âthat all the starlight followed Thy steps, and shone around, and overtook and swallowed All dark sad former things. This was the wonder of thee,âthat when I left thy presence The sombre vast sweet night seemed one vast starlit pleasance Full of the tender starshine of thy wings. This was the glory of thee,âthat all the sweet night found me Because of thee, and wound its starlit wings around me And kissed me into sleep. Yea, every star stepped forth, between me and the sorrow Of pale accustomed life that waited on the morrow: Thine was the army of night's purple deep. Between me and my past the whole star-army waited.â Therefore it was that all my soul, set loose, elated, Sprang forth with chainless glee. The innumerable stars were as a hedge behind me That never one fell throb of old-world pain might find me; And all this vast star-army followed thee. Thou wast the chieftainess of all the gathered legions Whose golden serried spears filled the blue heavenly regions, Each spear a valiant friend: Yea, onward through the night the star-hosts marched together, A night so still that one might hear a falling feather; Onward they came, an army without end. And then I heard strange voices;âvoices of the flowers And voices of my past; the voices of old hours Of summers long since dead; Voices of streams and hills, and voices of the mountains, And voices of far-off white-footed laughing fountains; Whispers of autumn sunsets golden-red; Voices of leaves of trees, and voices of green meadows, And voices of the limes tender with summer shadows; And last of all to me Came thrilling through the dark, sudden, without a presage, The deep-voiced stern immense inevitable message, Winged with large storm-winds, of the awful sea. And this was what they said: âDeep in thy spirit know it; Grasp this with grasp intense; cling to the knowledge, poet! Through all thy days be sure That never again the night will open thus her bosom Nor ever again the leagues of golden star-flowers blossom Enfolding thee in vast embrace and pure. âThis night thou hast the deep of heaven spread out before thee And all the golden stars shake out their banners o'er thee And rapture like a sea Surges. But not again shall the deep heaven be tender.ââ Yet, love, that sacred night's unfathomable splendour Took all its deathless boundless light from thee. Sept. 17, 1883. XXXVIII. âMADLY TENDER, MADLY PASSIONATE, RECKLESSLY DYING.â Yes, âmadâ. And is not love that loves so much As to be âmadâ with love the sweetest thing That ever nestled 'neath the song-god's wing Or sprang to beauty at the time-god's touch? Is not the love of every poet such? Were he not mad, would he have heart to sing? The wildest songs the mad love-poets bring Are just the songs which smile at death's cold clutch. The love that counts the thorns upon the road Is not love. This is loveâthough all the wide Fierce universe were on the other side Condemning, yet to know that God's heart glowed When, first, love's passionate eyes thy dark eyes met; That, when sweet love wept, God's own eyes were wet. XLIV. âWHEN I AM DEAD.â When I am dead, and thou art still quite young, By this song wilt thou then remember me? That much I have the right to ask of thee: Remember how I loved thee,âhow I sung. Summers so many, bright and blossom-strung, Are yet before thee. Many a summer sea Will hear thy laughter, and its silvery glee Will seem to it hoarse-toned, once thy laugh has rung. I would leave something sweet and pure and strong By which thou mayest remember me when I Mix no more with the sea's voice my love-song Nor my love's wings with the blue loving sky:â I write this book, to show how I loved thee: Think âIf his soul lives, still that soul loves meâ. LIV. OLD DREAMS. Old dreams of fairyland, pure boyish dreams delightful, Returned along with thee. My soul once more with rightful Strong energy took flame. Old dancing glancing thoughts the long sad years had hidden Sprang forth to life renewed, at thy sweet mandate bidden: Along thy path the dead romances came. These all leapt up alive, and sang in chorus round thee. The boyish woods took leaf, and bloom of old flowers found thee And pure old dreams once more Filled all my heart. Again I longed with knightly daring To carry thee away, through some green forest faring, Captive and hostage of some border war. Ah! those old days are dead. We cannot reillume them, Nor wake their worn-out hearts; we cannot disentomb them; We cannot bring them back, Nor mark once more, divine, and bright with laughter airy, Titania, loveliest queen and most delicious fairy, Weaving red heather-bloom beside the track. But thou hast brought them back. Thou in triumphant measure Hast quite renewed for me the lost days' boyish pleasure And given me heart to hear Slow, sweet, throughout the woods the fairy voices calling, And thine own laugh is like Titania's laughter, falling With lovelier cadence on my ravished ear. LXI. THE END OF LOVE. What is the end of love? To be maligned, forsaken.â What is the end of flowers? To be cast down and shaken To pieces by the blast. The daylight ends in gloom: the summer ends in winter: The grim Decembral hedge is decked with many a splinter Of ice where birds built soft nests in the past.â What is the end of long sweet tender tearful passion? What was the end of Christ,âreward of his compassion For the whole human race? The end was this; that all the human souls he sighed for, Loved to the very last, and agonized and died for, With laughter handed him to Death's embrace. LXXVI. âJUST FOR A MOMENT.â Just for a moment, sweet, the hand of love may stay thee And love's strong passionate voice arrest thee and delay thee,â Just for one little day. But ah! how short a time.âGod weeps to see the morning Whose brow his eager hand has been for hours adorning Suddenly shudder, and turn pale and grey. Not for the voice of Love will one fair blossom tarry: Not through the strength of love can one flower's frail shield parry The stroke that autumn deals:â Yet if my strong love fails to reach and win and mould thee Can even the strength of God the giver of passion hold thee?â At thought of losing thee my whole brain reels. LXXXII. THE VINE AND THE OAK. Yet how canst thou, O gentle girlish soul, Quite comprehend the larger soul of me? Can the white sea-bird apprehend the sea, Or the soft lute the far-off thunder's roll? Some love thou mayest grasp, but not the whole. Still I would wish my heart of love for thee With all its joy and deep solemnity To reach in some degree thy mind's clear goal. âPain I have had; and deeper pain than thine.â So to the fir-tree smitten by the stroke Of heaven's red lightning the soft rose-bush spoke: And why? Because the sun had ceased to shine! So wept, for one slight shower, the tender vine To the storm-sundered storm-defiant oak!â LXXXIII. TO NELLIE PLAYING. If the great poet dead who sang âConstantia singingâ Could hear the mellow notes beneath thy white hand ringing, What sweet thing would he say! Alas! he is not here. And I must try, and trying, Feel that my words have failed to give the witchery sighing Along the keys as thou dost softly play! Thou art the music, love, and if the poet-dreamer, Shelley, were here to-day, a lovelier and supremer Song he would sing for thee Than even for the voice of fair Constantia singing,â That, as her voice through his is still to-day soft-ringing, So might thy music soothe eternity. LXXXVIII. THE WONDROUS THING. This was the wondrous thing,âif Christian creeds are dreaming Of real eternal fact,âthat God who hath the gleaming Limitless realms of space For dwelling-place and home, deemed all that glory a minor Splendour than that of love, and held it far diviner To shine forth humbly through a human face. This was the wondrous deed,âthat God who through the spaces Passed like the wind of night, and filled the viewless places With majesty supreme, Was yet content on earth, for sweet love's sake, to tarry; Content our pain to bear and our wild sin to carry; Content to share the restless human dream. This was a kinglier height of grandeur, and supremer Than thought however vast of mightiest human dreamer Could ever grasp or span: That God the awful Lord of stars beyond all number Should with his own right hand relieve and disencumber His soul of godhead, and be born as man. This was a vaster deed than thought of loftiest singer Could ever quite devise: that God the great light-bringer Should leave the deep blue sky And venture forth alone, unguarded by his legions, And stoop to earth's malign inhospitable regions, And, being the Lord of life, should dare to die. And so it is with love. The strongest is the lowliest. The love most full of God, and greatest, and the holiest, Is not the love which clings To the fair starry skies or sunful, but the passion Which stoops above the earth with measureless compassion And shields the shieldless with perpetual wings. The love which gives is God.âThe love which softly falling Through tiers on tiers of stars respondeth to the calling Of love with footstep fleet: The love which never asks save onlyââAm I needed?â The love which through long years it may be half unheeded Seems some day terribly divine and sweet. LXXXIX. MY SWEETEST BLOSSOM. I know that I am old. I feel that very clearly: And that the flowers of life for me have perished nearly, And that the sunrise glows Far-off, the sunset near.âI know that thou art tender And young and fair and sweet, like the white maiden splendour Ere the sun kissed it of the first white rose.â I know that I shall pass while yet for thee the rivers Are blue and full of light,âwhile yet the alder quivers With young leaves o'er the tide; That, long ere thou art old, I may feel slowly wreathing Around my head death's cold inevitable breathing And mark his shadowy gaunt form at my side. Remember me, if death should take me while thou tarriest Still with the flowers of earth and thy light laughter marriest Still to the bright birds' song: Remember,âlike a dream,âthe poet-heart which found thee And the true poet-hand which circled thee and crowned thee With praise most tender, and with love most strong. Remember me.âOf all the flowers that I have gathered On slopes made bright with gorse, or hill-sides purple-heathered, Or cliffs that front the sea, The sweetest flower by far, the brightest and the truest, Of lilies my most white, of fairy bells my bluest, Is the sweet blossom of my love for thee. XCII. LOVE'S RIGHT. What right have I to thee!âWhy, just the right eternal That gives the strong wind leave to love the bright-browed vernal Pink blossoming almond-tree! The right by which the sun with passion immemorial, Kingly yet very sweet, divine not dictatorial, Loves the wide silvery laughter of the sea. The right by which the tree with boughs and leaves softbending Guards, loves the meadow-sweet its carpet white extending Beneath the strong tree's gaze: The right by which the moon that o'er the river gleameth Loves the rich purple thyme whose fragrant soft heart dreameth Beside the dark tall-irised water-ways. What right have I to thee! What claim in words to fashion! Merely the right and claim of fiery love and passion And tenderness outpoured: Merely the right of Love the large-eyed world-redeemer; Merely the desperate right of one wild-hearted dreamer, And, if man doubt it, my most wakeful sword. Merely the final right of love that knows no limit: That gazes in death's eyes, but finds no power to dim it Or dwarf it set therein: Merely the right supreme by which when all the bowers Besought the brow of God to wear their choicest flowers He chose a thorn-crown, the world's love to win. XCIII. âLOVE'S PORTRAIT.â Yes: thine is such a face that never, having seen it, Though all the wings of Time's vast legions rose between it And memory, could it fail To dawn upon the sight for ever and for ever: A face it is that mocks Art's passionate endeavour And leaves the soul that sees it glad and pale. Glad with a new strange sense of what the hand of Nature Can work in mystic charm of brow and eyes and feature And smile more sweet than these:â Pale with a trembling sense that even the mightiest passion, Most ardent wealth of words, can only in far-off fashion Divulge the beauty that the deep soul sees. XCVII. LOVE. The sea is very strong.âWhat is the one thing stronger? Than the vast fiery sweep of passionate storm-wind longer, And mightier than the waves As o'er the rocks they leap in thundering white-lipped millions Or surge far out at sea by trillions and quadrillions And chant death-choruses o'er countless graves. What is the power that o'er the measureless sea-laughter Triumphs, and scorns the scorn that shouts and follows after Its fair triumphal feet? Love: raising nigher to God the love-song of the willows Than all the angriest chant of the sinister billows, And nigher to God love's true heart's humblest beat. XCVIII. LOVE'S SORROW. This love has changed my life. But would I rather have it? If Fate upon my soul in red lines must engrave it Shall I still thankful be? The love that brings us pain, and yearning past expression, Is this in spite of all, this perilous possession, A gift to cling to through eternity? I think so.âWhen love's world first opens out before us, When first its sweet winds sing and golden stars shine o'er us, Its flowers are so divine We never never think of what shall follow after: We only hear the wind's caressing lovely laughter; We see no white crests on the far sea-line. Then when the dark days come, and all the flowers are faded, And the green thickets, dense with leafage once, invaded By the bleak keen wind's breath, We have the golden thought of summer days to cling to, And love's old image deep within the heart to sing to, Hurling song's utterance in the teeth of death. Yes. Love brings endless pain,âan infinite sword-anguish. Yet better far to love than through dull life to languish Devoid of love and pain. So, sweet, though love for thee has brought me pain exceeding Yet from my heart's true depths, though love therein lies bleeding, I cry, âLove's sorrow is immortal gainâ.</field>
