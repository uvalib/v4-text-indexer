      <field name="fulltext">[Parvus and Magnus Cato] [Parvus Cato] I Whan I aduertyse in my remembrance And see, how feele folk erre greuously In the way of vertuose gouernance, I haf supposyd in my self, that I Aught to support and consell prudently Them to be full gloriose in lyuynge And how they shall hem self to honour brynge. II Therfore, my leef childe, I shall teche the, Herkyn me well, the maner and the gyse How thyn soule inward shall acqueynted be With thewys good and vertue in all wyse. Rede and conceyue; for he is to dispise, That redyth aye and wot not, what is ment. Suche redyng is not elles but wynd dispent. III Pray thy God and prayse hym with all thyn hert. Fader and moder haf in reuerence; Love them well. And be thow neuer to smert To here mennys counsell; but kepe the thens, Till thow be clepyd. Be clene without offence. Salue gladly. To hym, that is more digne Than art thy-self, thow shalt thy place resigne. IV Drede thy maister. Thy thynges loke thow kepe. Take hede to thy household. Loue aye thy wyfe. Plesaunt wordys out of thy mouthe shall crepe. Be nat irouse. Kepe thy behest as lyfe. Be tempred with wyne and not to excessiue. Thy wyues word make non auctorite In folye. Slepe no more than nedyth the. V In goodly bokys whilome shalt thow rede; And that thow redyst, in thyn mynd it shytt. Styre no wyght to wrath. Lye not, I the rede, Do well to good, and that will eft be quytt. Be not wikkyd, ne to the wykkyd knytt. Stond in the place of pletyng excersise. Deme the ryght. Be counseld of the wyse. VI Play with a toppe; the dyse loke thow eschewe. Despise not women; kepe them thy behest. Skorne neuer wreche; for than thow shalt it rewe. Couette no mannys good. Spek few at fest. Loke thy vengeance be alway with the lest. Who hath done the good, haf in remembrance. Love euery wyght, and thys shall the avaunce. Lenvoye. VII Behold, my maister, thys lityll tretyse, What it is full of wytt and sapience, Enforceth ?ow the mater to complise. Thynk it is translate at ?owr reuerence. Enrolle it therfor in ?owr aduertence. Desyre to know, what thys Catoun ment. Whan ?e it rede, lat not ?owr hert be thens. Doth as thys saith with all ?owr hoole entent. Explicit liber parui Catonis [Magnus Cato] VIII For why that God is inwardli the witte Off man and yeueth hym vndirstondyng, As ditees seith, therfore shalt thou vnshitte Thyn herte to thyn souereyn lord and kyng. Pryncipalli a-boue alle othir thyng, Yeuyng hym laude, honour and reuerence, Whiche hathe endued the with excellence. IX A-wake, my childe, and love no slogardye; In muche sleep look thou neuer delite, Yiff thou purpose to worship for to stye. Long sleep and slouthe to vices men excite; It makith dulle, it makith vnparfite; It fostreth vp the filthes of the flessch; It palith eek and wastith bloodis fressch. X Trist weel also: the first of vertuys alle Is to be stille and keep thi tonge in mewe. Off tunge vnteied muche harme may falle. And, leve me weel, this is as gospell trewe: Who can delaviaunce of woord eschewe And reste with resoun, this is verray text, To God a-bove that man is aldir-next. XI Auyse the weel, that thou neuer trauerse Thi owne sentence; for theroff risethe shame. Sey nat oon and eft the contrary reherse. Such repugnaunce wille make thy worship lame, Wher stedefastnesse wil cause the good fame. For he shal neuer accorde with man on lyue, That with hymsilfe will ay repugne and stryve XII Yiff thou aduertise and behold a-boute The liffe of men and ther maners also, Both of thi silf and othir the withoute, In myddilerthe thou shalt nat fynden, who That in summe parti ne is to vertu fo. Blame no man therfore, iff thou do a-riht; Sith on erth lakles lyueth ther no wiht. XIII Yiff thou suppose thynges shall noye and greeue, Thouh thei be der and of riht grete apprise, Such as suffreth nat thi profette acheeue, Yiff thou list be reuled as the wise, Absteyne the from suich thynges in all wise; For it is more wisdom in sothfastnesse To proferr profette than such richesse. XIV It is a good lessoun for the nones A wiht now to be tempred with constaunce And to be glad and mery eft-soones, Nat alwey sad ne liht of contenaunce. A mannys cheer may hym ful oft avaunce; For att eche tyme, as the thyng requyrith, So the wiseman viseageth and cheerith. XV Yiff nat credence alwey to thy wiffe, That for hir ire and hir vnpacience With sharper tonge than is swerd or knyffe Pleynyth on thi seruaunt, thouh non offence Thou fynd in hym; leer weel this sentence. The wiffe wille hate and cause for to smerte Oftyn hym, that hir housbonde loueth in herte. XVI And iff thou warne a wiht of his surfette, Althouh he gruchche with frownyng contenaunce And in his language manace the and thrette, Yit forber nat for al such displesaunce To teche hym amende his gouernaunce. As thou began, correcte that is a-mysse; For that is ay a freendli teche i-wisse. XVII Ageyns the wordy folk ay full of wynde Stryue nat atte all; it may the nat profite. Such iayissh folk been in conceitis blynde. The witles word auaileth nat a myte. In woordis fele is wisdom oft full lite. For to euery wiht is youen speche; And yit the wise full ofte been to seeche. XVIII Love othir men and haue hem so cheer, That to thy silfe thy love may moste extende. Looke that no persone be to the mor deer Than thyn estat; for than shaltt thou offende And hurte thy silfe and othir folk amende. But ay cherissh othir and love hem soo, That to thi silffe thou be nat founden foo. XIX Rumours newe, that flyen as the wynde, Eschew, my child, with al thi dilligence. Be neuer besy newe tidinges for to fynde; Such nouelte causeth ofte offence. It is no witt, it is no sapience, It hurtith nat a man to be in pes; But it dothe harme to putt his tonge in pres. XX Make no promys of othir mennys heste. Remembre weel, that promys is vnsure; And but thou keep it, thi name thou sleste. To serue thi beheste do thou thy cure. Trist nat the woord of euery creature. Sum mannys feithe is esy for to breke; For many folke thynke nat as thei speke. XXI With woordis fair whan fauel fedith the, Be thou nat blent for his fals flaterie. Latt thyn owne reson alway thy iuge be. And, in effecte, if thyn estate be hyhe, Thouh fauell with his craft wil blynd thyn ye, In al thy lyfe thou neuer geue credence More of thi silfe than to thy conscience. XXII Whan thou seest a-nothir mannys desert, As for his good deedis comendable, In euery place, preuy and aperte, Such a wiht with thi good woord enable. And thouh thou haue be riht available, Yit of thi good deede make thou no bobbaunce, And than othir men shall thy name enhaunce. XXIII And thou lyve longe an olde man shall thou bee. Age wille approche maugre alle that sey nay. Than perceyue, behold a-boute and see, How agid folk been tretid euery day; And so to purveye for thy silfe assay. Into stoupyng age whan thou art crepte, Thyng may the helpe, that in youthe was kepte. XXIV Charge nat, al-thouh sume mene speke softe, Ne chaunge no cheer; for oft it is weel bett In secrete wise to speke than crye on lofte. A man shuld see alwey, wher he wer sette, And aftir that so schuld he speke or lette. But to the suspect of harme it seemeth Men speke of hym; he noon othir demyth. XXV Whan fortune hathe youe the felicite And sette the on hihe, than war the of a falle; Than sueth oft ful sharp aduersite. Fals fortune turnethe as a balle; In hir trost haue thou no sykirnesse att all. Her perilous play turneth whilom to grame; The eend is woo, of that began with game. XXVI Our bretil liff is heer so ful of doute, That in verray surete no wiht may stond. So sodenly creepe the soulis oute Al a-boute this world in euery lond Off yong and old; for euery wiht is bonde To dethe. Therfor sett nat thyn affiaunce In deth of hym, that may survyue perchaunce. XXVII A litil yift youen with good entent Off thi frend, that lith in pouerte, With riht good cheer such yifte take and hent, Supposyng ay, that as good wille hath he And more than many men, that richer be. Peise nat the yifte ne pondre nat the pris. The entent is good, and that may the suffice. XXVIII Sith nature, that is the firste norice. Hath brouht the hidr all nakid and al bare, Thouh thou neuer can richesse accomplice But thou arte hold alway in pouertis snare, Yit, no force, make neuer to muche care, Take pacientli pouerte for the beste. Richesse is nat of nature, but of conqueste. XXIX Thouh deth be fyne of euery creature, And no wiht on lyue shall from it escape, Yit dreede nat deth with ouer besy cure. To lyve in erthe than is but a iape, Iff thou shalt aftir dethe so alway gape. Thynk weel to deye, but modifie thi thouht, Or ellis to lyue auaileth the riht nouht. XXX For thi desert if no freende thanke the, I meen, whan thou haste don thi force and peyne To othir folk ful freendli for to bee, Iff thei can nat to the grauntmercy seyne, Withdrawe thyn hand and so thi silfe restreyne. Blame nat thy God for theer vnfreendlynesse, But for such men do aftirwarde the lesse. XXXI Sith no richer man ne liveth any-wher, Yiff he consume his goodis alle and waste, But that pouert shall greue hym sore and dere, Therfor, my child, such goodis as thou haste, Latt nat to soone out of thyn handis be rafte. Last that thi good hereaftir wille the faill, Hold, that thou haste; it may the eft availl. XXXII Behote noman a thyng to leene hym twise And faile hym; that is but a vilanye. Yiff thou may leende, do it in ffreendly wise. Such cheuysance wil freendlynesse bewrie. Off thi good deed clamour nat ne crye. Be nat to wyndy nor of wordes breeme, Yif a good mann the list appeer and seeme. XXXIII And yiff thou fynde the sone of dowbilnesse, The fals dissimulour if thou espie With peyntid woord and hert ful of falsnesse, Thou maist in no wise better bleer his ye Than serue hym with his owne trecherie. For woordis fair and freendlynesse no part Yeue thou the same and so aart begyle with aart XXXIV Preeve nat a man bi ouer-peyntid speche. Undir fair woordis ys ofte couerid gyle. The woord is gay, but frenship is to seeche. And as men sey, such craft is in this ile: Summe thynken harm, whan thei hir tonges file. The whistlyng fouler maketh mery song, And yit briddis begilethe he a-mong. XXXV Whan that God hathe youen the children fele And no richesse, than do thou in this wise: Teche thy children with craftis for to dele, That with their aart thei may hemsilf cheuyse. Yiff thou do thus, thou werkist as the wise. Craft is ful good, and craft is lucratyffe; By craft thei may deffende the nedy liffe. XXXVI Haue this conceit; for it is often seen, Thynges deer shall ofte abate of prise, And thynges, that of litil valewe been, In tyme comyng may to grete derthe a-rise. Remembre this and it weel aduertise. Thus shalt thou beste the name of chynchery fleme. And othir men shall the no negard deeme. XXXVII A-vyse the weel, latte resoun be thy guyde, Whan othir folk thou art a-boute to blame, That suche defaute in the be nat aspied; For if ther be, than shalt thou haue the shame. A manys honour such thynges will reclame. It is ful foule, whan that a man will teche, Iff that his deede a-yens his woordis preche. XXXVIII Loke thi desir be groundid in a riht And that it neuer trauers honeste; For as oft-tymes, as any wiht Desirith more than riht or equite, Than may his request repellid be. And it is clepid nycete and grete folye To asken oft thatt men will ay denye. XXXIX Chaunge nat thi freende, that thow knowest of old, For any newe in trost, that thou shalt fynde Bettir than he; but in thyn handis hold Hym, that hathe to the ffreendly been and kynde. Such eschaunges been ful often blynde. Thou weenest to knowe and yit knowist nat a deel. To know a freend it is a casuel. XL Sith manys liff is fulle of miserie, Whilom in mirthe and aftir in myscheef, Now in the vale, now in the mont on hihe; Now man is poore and eft richesse releffe; The shynyng morwe hath ofte a stormy eve— To this policie take heed and entend: Look thou haue lucre in thi labours eende. XLI Thouh thou may venquyssh and haue the victory Off thi freend and felawe, yit forbere. Reffreyn thi silfe; be nat hawteyn ne to hihe. Irous hauntes ful oft men do dere, Wher esy softnesse freendis may conquere. For bi good deedis, sett in lowlynesse, Men be to-gidre knytt in freendlynesse. XLII The lymytour, that visiteth the wyues, Is wise i-nouh. Of hym a man may leer To yiuen girdiles, pynnes and knyues. This craft is good; thus dothe the celi freere: Yiueth thynges smale for thynges, that been deer. Iff thou receyue, gif ay sumwhat ageyn; And that wille norissh freendes deer certeyn. XLIII Toil nat ne stryve with hym, that is thi freende. Bewar of that: make nat thi freend thi foo. A toilous man may frenship breke and sheende. Thes baratours, that beth mysreulid soo, Intrike hemsilfe and wrappe hem in much wo. For ire of kynde engendrith nat but hate, Wher-as accorde norisheth loue algate. XLIV Whan thi seruant thou takist in diffaute, Thouh he cannat his necligence excuse, Yit in thyn ire make nat to fers assaute, But with thi maletalent a while take trewse; Thow shalt fynde ese, this feet if thou vse: Reule thi passioun euer bi such mesure, That thou save hem, that be vndir thi cure. XLV ‘Suffraunce dothe ese’, was seid full yore a-goo. Suffre thou and haue al thyn entent. Thouh thou may ouercome, yit do nat soo. Conquere thoruh suffraunce and be pacient, But to foul cruelte neuer consent; For it is clepid in vertu excellence A wiht to lyue in humble pacience. XLVI Be nat to scant, be nat to prodigal. Conserue thy thyng goten with labour. It is ful faire to be said liberal, But eschew waste and be no surfetour. Consume nat al thy tresour in an hour. Whan of thi labour riseth noon availle, Nedy pouerte must the ful soone assaille. XLVII Be nat like Sceuola; for he wold ete With euery man and at his feest hym feede. But neuer wiht myht tasten of his mete; Noman to hym, but he to all men yeede. Be fre of mete, but look that largesse leede The no ferther then thou may weel atteyne. Be thyn owne freend, thus seith Catoun certeyn. Lenvoye. XLVIII Take heed, sire, how holsumly this clerk Entretith men with vertuous doctrine, His firste part of this compendious werk, In worschip how thei shal ful cleerly shyne, Gydyng to renoun streiht as any lyne; Whos preceptis obseruen if ye list And to his good cownsel yowr herte enclyne, Riht on your welthe full weel it shal be wist. XLIX The vertues foure, that men shoold foorth conveie Loo in this liff, as bridill dothe a beest, That man nat erre heer in this pereilous weye, Stablisshyng hym, as dothe a stedfast reest, As sikir guydes, that been worthiest Mannys lyuyng to sette in gouernaunce, This sage Catoun ful wisely doth regest. Preentith his sawes in yowr remembraunce. Explicit pars prima. L Iff thou list, my child, setten thyn delite Off erthe for to knowe the tilthe and the cultur, And iff thou wilt be of knowlech perfit Whi summe is arable and summe is pasture, And whi summe is spreynt with floury pictur, I conseil the to musen for a while In the laureat poete greete Virgile. LI And forthermor, my chyld, if that thou list The vertues of herbes for to discrive,— It may nowher in erthe bettir be wist, Which be consumyng and which be nutritive, Which hote, which cold, which confortatyve,— Than reede Macere in his old ditee, Which tellith hem in propre qualite. LII And iff thou haue desirous fressh corage To heer of noble Romayns worthynesse, How that thei venquesshed them of Cartage And many othir thoruh manly prowesse, Than reede Lucan; fful weel can he expresse, Who bar hym best in toun and eek in feeld, And who dide merueillis vndir Martis sheeld. LIII But he, that list of louers for to reede And in that wise hymsiluen so tauaunce, As in that craft Naso can teche hym speede. Summe louyth song, sume harpe, lute and daunce, Summe othir dyvers thynges of plesaunce; Summe louyth couertly and list nat been espied; Summe will be knowe; and thus writith Ouyde. LIV But yit, my leeff child, iff in auentur Thyn hert be youe to nomaner of such thyng, Or iff it be nat al to thyn plesure, That Virgil, Macer, Lucan and Naso bryng, Yit that thou may be wise in thy lyuyng, Iff the list to yeue me audience, I shal shewe the doctryne of sapience. LV Therfore, my chyld, cum vnto me and leer, And I shal the shew the verray tresur Off sapience, if that the list to heer, And how thou shalt in good estate endur And leede thi lyff aftir Goddis plesure. Therfore come neer and leer bi thys reedyng To be a man vertuous in lyuyng. LVI Ther is no wiht, that ferther may reporte, Off thi good deedis, than the straunger may. Make hym good cheer and shew hym thy disport, And he shall vttir the, this is no nay; For the vnknowe sumtyme to do assay. Freendis inowe to have is bettir thyng Than is freendles a man to been a kyng. LVII Off Goddis misterie and his werkyng Make neuer, my child, to ferre inquirance. It is foli to muse vpon such thyng. Dispute neuer thi Goddis purueiaunce. All thyng must be vndir his gouernaunce. Sith thou art man clad in mortalite, Dispute thou thynges such as mortal be. LVIII The dreede of deth that is inordinat,— I meene, to dreed it ay and neuer cees. Bewar of that, I conceil the algate; For this is as trewe as gospel douteles. Who dreed it so, is alway merthelesse. Whan dreede of dethe a man so aggreggithe, It wastithe liff and his tyme abreggithe. LIX For thyng, that is to the vncerteyne. Whan thou art wrothe, look neuer þat þou stryve; Thi passions esili withdrawe and refreyn. For ther is no persone in erth on lyve, But that vnresounles he is als blyue As besy wrathe hath kyndled hym on fyre. And than can he nat deeme the trouthe for ire. LX As tyme requerith, so make thyn expence. Mesure thyn hand aftir thyn proprite Off thynge, of tyme, and aftir the presence. See that thou spende nomor than nedith the. And that to spende loke that thyn herte be fre. A man shold do cost and make his spendyng Considryng tyme and rewardyng the thyng. LXI To much is nouht of any maner thyng. The meen is good and moste comendable. That man stant surest heer in his lyuyng, With meen estat that halt hym greable. Plente and pouerte be nat suffrable. For than is the ship in the see moste sur, What tyme the flode excedithe nat mesur. LXII Iff thou knowe ouht, that may turne vnto shame, Keep it secre; for nothyng it bewrye. Be nat to besy such thynges to pro-clame And publissh, as thou knowest pryuye. Make nat all men on it to gaur and crye, Lest mo deprave, whan thow thi woord hast sowe, That was before to othir folke vnknowe. LXIII Iff thou espie and see a surfetour, A theeff, a shrew of much mysgouernaunce, Trist weel summe tyme that ther shal come an hour, Whan for his deede he shal suffre penaunce. Cursed deede askith wrech and vengaunce. Thouh wikkydnesse for tyme be kept secre, Yitt att the laste will it discurid be. LXIV Thouh that summe tyme natur hathe been vnkinde And youe a man to be of smal stature, Yit, my child, remembre and haue in mynde That thou neuer dispise that creature. For God may sendde hym fortune and good vre, Als oft thei be with good counseil allied, To whom that nature hathe grete strength denyed. LXV Whan the happithe trauers or haue a-do With oon thou knowist nat egal to thi myht, Thyn vttrest powere shewe nat such vnto, Lest that eft-soone he haue the in such pliht. For it is seen in turment and in fiht: Fortune chaungethe ofte withynne an hour, And he is sconfet, that erst was victowr. LXVI Off brondis smale be maad thes fires grete. Withdrawe the brond, the fier shal eek discrees. A-gein the knowe, that herr, loke thou nat bete With woordis fele; for woord distrobleth pes. The man is wise, that can of woordis cees. For this is sothe as God yaf the thi liffe: Off woordis small is bred ful muche striffe. LXVII Deele nat withe sorcerye ne with surquedrie. In Goddis hand is all thi sort and fate. Be nat a-boute to calkle thy distanye, Iff thou be myserous or ffortunate. Lat God allone; in hym is all thy state. And that hym list of the for to purpose, Withoute the can he fulweel dispose. LXVIII Bewar of envye with hir techches fell. Withynne thyn herte looke that she nat reste. For it is oon of the peynis of helle. Whan she soiourneth in a mannys breste, Than brennithe Fenix withynne his owne neste. And thouh she may non othir man myscheeue, Yit Ethna cesith nat hirsilfe to greue. LXIX Enforce thyn herte with manly sufferaunce, Thouh wrong iugement a-yens the proceede. Be nat abassht in woord ne countenaunce; For the processour may reule and leede The lawe; but trost me weel withouten dreede, Long to reioisshen acheueth he nate, Which bi menys vntrewe his goodis gate. LXX Wraththe of olde, that shuld be oute of mynde, Be nat aboute to make it eft on lyue, But the envious hathe that tech of kynde. Such malice, my childe, look thou nat revive; For such ire of old makithe a new stryve. And who that remembrithe old enmyte, A wikkid man forsothe, my childe, is he. LXXI Thi silfe also looke that thou nat preise Ne dispreise, but lette othir men allone. Alway aftir prudence thi woordis peise. For thyn avaunt honour shalt thou gete none, But haue a mokke as faste as thou arte gone. A man to preise hymsilfe, as seithe the scoole, Or dispreise moche is token of a foole. LXXII Whan it is tyme of coste and grete expence, Bewar of waste, and spend as bi mesure. Who that to keepe and spende no difference Makith, his goodis may nat longe endure. The olde sawe seithe: Mesur is tresure. For in short tyme the good may slippe a-waye, That was goten in many a sondry day. LXXIII It is no wisdam alway to be sage. But sumtyme to seeme nyce and feyn folye, Who that hathe this fet, shal fynde avauntage. What tyme and thyng requerithe, that espie; And than dissimule, that is good policie. Summe tyme to be vnwise in apparence Among the wise is clepid ful hih prudence. LXXIV The filthy flessh, in meuyng bestiall, That fihtithe ay a-yens the soule withynne Bi force of hir entisment sensuall, Eschewe, my chyld, and keepe the from hir gynne. That and grace been sette ful ferr atwynne. And fle of auerice the wikkid fame: Thes too it be, that causen euyl name. LXXV Beleve nat in every wihtis sawe; For sume reporte thynges al othir wise Than it was don or any man it sawe. And sume have it of custum and of guyse To feed folk withe flatrie and with lise. Yif litil trost therfor to suche spekyng; For many folk spekith many a thyng. LXXVI Yff thou surfete in drynk for-yete nat that. Avyse the eft, thou come nat in that snare. Withdrawe thyn hand; feede nat thy throte so fatte; Drynk, that suffisith the, and elles spare. To much drynk makethe men of wit ful bare. And yit the wyne therof is nat to blame, But the drynkere makithe hymsilfe lame. LXXVII To thi trosty freend, that is ay secre, Shew thi counseil; to hym thyn herte bewry. A trosty freend is chest of pryuyte; But it is hard such freendes to espie. Trye oute oon a-mong a companye. And of thy body betake thou the cure To suche a leche as is trosty and sure. LXXVIII Withynne thy silfe a-greve the nat to sore, Thouh thyng amys sume tyme the betide; Dismay the nat in besy wise therfore. Thyn auenture thou muste needis a-bide; Fortune may nat alwey be on thy side; With harmes to greve in a-waite lith she To reven men welthe and prosperite. LXXIX In thi silffe compasse a-boute before Thyng to perceyue, that aftir schall befalle. It noieth nat nor greueth half so sore, That is forseyn, as othir thynges shall. Sodeyn chauncis disesithe moste of all. It hurtithe lesse, and is in better pliht, Wheroff beffore a man can haue insight. LXXX Whan dyuers thynges trauers thyn entent, And thow art wrappid in aduersite, War for wanhope thou be nat lost and shent. Latt nat dispeir thy witte bereuen the. A-bide the tyme, that she shall better be. Hope is she, that shal make the a sethe; Hope leueth nat a man, thouh man leue the brethe. LXXXI Whan men profre, it is tyme to receyve. Take thynges, whil thei be in seson. Thei profre now, that eft will yiftis weyue. Plente nowe will aftirward be gesoun. Take in tyme; for so comaundithe resoun. The ballid hed, whilom full of heris, Now is bare withoute rasour or sheris. LXXXII Prouyde thy silfe and haue delyueraunce, Be likly coniectur what may be-tide. Aduertise, my childe, in thi remembraunce Affore and aftir, aboute in euery side. Follow God, and lat hym be thi guyde, That hathe al thyng in his gouerment, Futur and passid and that, that is present. LXXXIII It is a tecche of a deuouryng hounde To receyue superflue and don excesse, Til his receit a-geyn from hym rebounde. Contente thy nature and flee gredynesse. Foule lustis ay keepe vndir and represse. Feed nat thi lust with all, that she wil craue, Yff that in helthe thou lust thi body save. LXXXIV Whan a multitude hathe youen a decre Or concludith ouht a-yens thyn entent, Trauers nat yit a-yens the comonte; For iff thou do, thou shalt lihtly be shent. Dispise nat alone the peples iugement. In auenture thou plese of hem nat oon, Whil thou wilt impugne hem euerychon. LXXXV Take good heed vnto thyn owne estate To reule thy body weel with good diete. But look with tyme thou be nat at debate, Thouh thoruh thyn owne mysreule and surffete Seeknesse or sorwe hathe youen the an hete. The tyme is good, and no dismale ther is, But men it make, for that thei do amys. LXXXVI Dreede no dremys, so seithe Deutronomy, Thouh thei be causid of compleccioun, Or ellis of any nyced fantasie, Or of a superflue replecioun. For dremys be but fals illusioun. Whan men be wakyng, thei desire or thynke; Vpon that thyng thei dreme, whan thei wynke. Lenuoye. LXXXVII Musithe a while, what all thes maters meen. A-bidith, sire, and go no ferther yitt. To reden hem, auaileth not a been, But iff a man the kernel wil vnknitt. Therfore your mynde and al your hert vnshitt And loke whatt lith vndir the boistous rynde. And I dar say, of wisdom and of witt Plente and foisoun therin shall ye fynde. LXXXVIII Reffressheth you with this holsom diete, That fostreth vertue and keepith on lyue. To your persone me thynkith it ful meete For to receyue such a nutrytive, Which your astate shal ay preserue on lyue In grete honour and keepe yow fro noysaunce, Oute of daunger and vices infectyve, Yiff ye will werche aftir this ordynaunce. LXXXIX And in especiall looke, that your deede May bere trewe wittenesse and testifie The mateer, that ye beholde and reede. Looke with your herte as weel as with your eye. Than, dar I say, sumwhat shall ye espye, That to this werk shall meven your corage. Wherfor your hert, your eye and all applye, Your silf to reule aftir thes ditees sage. Explicit secunda pars. XC Behold, what wiht that listith for to reede In this my ditee, somwhat shall he fynde, Wherwith his soule he may fostre and feede With thewes good and it from vices vnbynde. Come neer, my child, therfore and haue in mynde Suche doctryne to beer a-wey and leer, As to thy liff shall be full leef and deer. XCI The soule resemblith a new pleyn table, In which as yit apperith no picture, The filisophre seithe withouten fable. So is the soule but a dedly figure, Til the tyme she be recleymed with the lure Off doctryne and so gete hir a good habite To bene expert in connyng and parfite. XCII Inprente my techyng in thy soule stedfaste; And ful profitable thou shalt it fynde. Forsake it nat ne from thyne hert it caste; For iff that thou exclude oute of thy mynde This lessoun, thow art full bareyn and blynde Fro vertu. And therof a-wite nat me, Sith the deffaute, my sone, is than in the. XCIII Iff thou lyve iustly keepyng the vpriht, Neuer declynyng for meed ne for fauour, Than stondist thou in a ful holsum pliht, Thouh men maligne with woordes of rygoure Yff thou live thus thi good liff is thi tour. We may nat lette the peple to gawre and crye. But do we weel; if thei sey mys, thei lye. XCIV Iff thou be clepid the sothe to testyfye, Ay sauyng thy worship and honeste, Thi freendis trespace be nat a-bout to wrie, Wher as no shame may growe therof to the. This requirith ay freendlynesse parde. In wele and woo the trewe benyvolence Bi-twix folke is frensship in existence. XCV Make besy wacche, and keep thi soule algate, Behold a-boute, aspie the couert treyne, Whan that fals fauell knockethe atte gate, He menythe guyle, thow outeward fair he feyn. He can enoynte softly thyn erys tweyn With oile of plesaunce in ful grete foysoun; But vndir that keepe the from his poisoun. XCVI Slouth, slogardy and dul idylnesse, Lacches, that causeth to be necligent, Eschew, my child, with all thi bisynesse; For ydill soule makith the body shent. Ther is on erthe no gretter argument For to conclude the body vnapte Than that the soule in idilnesse be wrapte. XCVII Who that lacketh reste, may nat longe endure; Therfor a-mong take thyne ese and disporte. Delite the neuer in besynesse and cure, But that whilom thou maist also resorte To play, recreacioun and conforte. Thou shalt the bettir labour at the longe, Whan thou haste merthe thi bisynesse a-monge. XCVIII It is full hard to plese iche a wiht. Dispreise nomanys deedis nor hem lakke, Ne woordes nother. For even so riht As thou deprauyst hym, byhynde thy bakke Riht so wol men make the a mokke and a knakke. The contrarye thouh men had it sworne, The skorner shal be guerdoned ay with scorne. XCIX Whan thi laste sort, that som men clepyn fate, Is good and plesaunte aftir thyn entente,— Thus meen I, loo, whan thou arte fortunate,— Receyue the good, that God hathe the sent. Suffre it nat rechelessely to be spente. For than of wastour thou shalt haue the name, For grete ryot will causen feble fame. C Into grete age what tyme that thou art krepte And thou hast richesse and grete habundaunce, Be liberall of good, that thou haste kepte. Thynk thou hast inowh and suffisaunce. Latt nat thi good of the haue gouernaunce; But gouern it and parte it with thy freende. Whan thou goste hens, it may nat with the weende. CI Grace is youen to men in sondry wise: Sum haue wisdom, and som haue elloquence. Thes pore folk somtyme thei ben full wise. A seruaunt may be of grete sapience, Thauh he be had in litel reuerence. Reward his wit, if it be worth the while. Vertue is hid vndir an habite vile. CII This woorldis welthe, ebbynge and flowyng ay At no certeyn, as is wantoun Aprile, Thouh thou haue lost, thou shalt nat the dismay. Be content with that thou hast for the while. Sume man ther is, that hathe nouthir cros ne pile Now in this world, and yit good auentur Is hym ful nyh. No man can know his vre. CIII Wedde nat a wiffe for hir inheritaunce; For she wol caste it ful oft in thy berde. And if she be noysaunt, ful of greuaunce, Constreyne hir nat to biden in thi yerde. Off chastyment it is a curside yerde To keepen oon, that wol the ay atwyte. He is att ese, that of such on is quyte. CIV Off othir men thow shalt thy myrour make. Conforme the to that moste men appreve. What thou shalt do and what thou shalt forsake, A bettir fette maist thou nat contreve Than to othir mennys deede releeve. In al, that perteynethe to thy techyng, Make othir men a rewle for thy lyvyng. CV Attempte no thyng, that sourmountith thy myht Ne that to ffynyssh thow mayste nat accheve; For than thou stondist foule in thyne owne liht. Ouer his power what man leste to meeve, With shame his werke moste nedis take leve. It is foly a man such thynges to begynne, Which to perfourme his wittis be to thynne. CVI Law presumeth, that what man kepith stille The cryme of oon, that hath don grete offence, And discurith it nat, he is als ille, As is the cryminous for his silence. Wherfore, my sone, bryng it in audience, That thou perceyuest nat weel don is, Leste for silence men deeme of the a-mys. CVII Whan that the lawe is streit and rigerous, Entrete the iuge to shewen the fauour, Enclynyng hym for to be gracious. An egal iuge may the parcaase socour, And yit the lawe shal be his gouernoure, Which he suethe somtyme to modyfie, In the caas he may a poynt espye. CVIII What peyn thou suffrest for thi deserte, Receyue it weel with gre in paciens. And thouh thi trespace be preuye and couerte, Yitt, whan thou feelist in thyn aduertence, That thou arte blemsshed in thi conscience, Withynne thy silfe than make arbitrement, Deemyng thy-silfe in thyn owne jugement. CIX Mispende no tyme for slouthe or for lacchesse, But whilom reed in bookis olde and wise. Reed and reporte with grete attentyfnesse. Be reedyng to connyng men may arrise. Than reed, my sone, and connyng accomplise. Thes poetes writen thynges of grete meruayle And of smalle credence oftyn, thys is no faile. CX A-mong freendis sittyng at the feest Be curteis and demure of thy language. Who spekith moste, may nat offende leste. Off flessh and boon nature hathe made a cage The tonge to keepe, that she be nat outrage. Than if thou wolt ben losed of norture, Refreyne thyn tonge with al thy besy cure. CXI Some wommen weepyne of pur femynyte, Whan othir wise thei kan nat her entente Accheve; but yit beware of nyce pite Thi manly resoun, that it be nat blent. For suche wepyng thyne hert auhte nat relente. Some wommen of kynde be euer-moor weepyng And vndir that kan thei bothe prikke and stynge. CXII That thou haste goten, to thin owne worship vse. What auailethe richesse withoute honoure? To spare good and worship to refuse The nygard chynche with peyne and with labour Is besy. But I reede the nat devour Withouten resoun thy good excessiffly; For than muste thou begge of othir hastily. CXIII Enprente, my childe, ay sadly in thy mynde, That thou be nat of deth to sore adradde, That shal the from wrecchidnesse vnbynde, Wher-in thi liff longe thou hast ladde, Til of thy corps thy soule hathe ben ful sadde. For riht as dethe is eend of ferfulnesse, So is she eende of al thy wrecchydnesse. CXIV Thi wifis woord suffre and take in gree, Whan it availeth; for betide it may Ful ofte, that of riht grete prudence is she And muste ben a-lowed, this is no nay. Suffre hir than and hir conceit assay. For it is hard, whan thou can nat be stille, Ne hir to suffre thou kanst haue no wille. CXV Goodis, that be youen the of nature, Comethe eek of thy progenytours. Therfore, my child, with al thi force and cure Love hem weel and cherissh at all hours. Thei fostred the and kept in youthe shours. Thi moodir, my child, in especiall, Iff thou do wele, neuer offende at all. Lenuoye. CXVI Resorte, resorte and hidirward releve. My maister, now her is an holsom ayr. For your availe vnto this place retreve, Wher-as of moralite floures fayre And swete ful plesauntly, lo, dothe repeir. Gadrith therof and makithe yow a gay And restethe yow heer riht in this herbeire. Behold and see, what thyng is to your pay. CXVII Whane ye haue gadrid floures to your liste, Tastethe hem; for thei ben preseruatiffe. Holdithe hem fast and berethe in your fiste. For the pestilence ayers infectyffe I conseil yow, and iuparte my liff, That ye shall leede your liff in sikirnesse Thoruh vertue of this conseruatiffe And eeke atteyne to muche worthynesse. CXVIII Thus meve I you vndir proteccioun Off your good grace, what tyme ye reede Or haue in this mateer inspeccioun, As it biddith, that ye wol don in deede. And than I dar afferme withouten dreede, Ye shall accheve and be ful vertuous. Heer shal ye fynde, that you may guyde and leede Streiht to good fame and bryng yow til hir hous. Explicit tertia pars. Würzburg. Max Förster. CXIX What wiht that list to leede in sikirnesse His lif and keepe his soule from accombraunce Of vices, which a-yens good thewes expresse Beth at stryff, com yiff good attendaunce. Thes preceptis keepe wel in remembrance. Enrollyng hem and pryntyng in your mynde. How to lyve wel, the mene shal ye fynde. CXX The foule talent of richesse, my child, eschewe. Resemble nat the gredy Tantalus Whos etike in hungre is alway newe Among the fair applis delicious; Ne watir swete quenchythe his thurst riht thus. To the violente swolwe of couetise So al this world nat can ne may suffise. CXXI Natur can be with litil thyng contente, As in diete a man shuld neuer charge Hymsilf with mete; for many men be shente, For their receitis ben to grete and large. Men seen al day: the litell boot and barge Wol drench a-non, whan it is ouer-freiht. Cherissh nature, but hurt hir nat with weiht. CXXII Iff thin thyng thou happe to mysgouerne Withoute reson or any prouydence, Than, myn owne child, of me this lessoun lerne: Sey nat, it was thi fortune such expence To make, but wyte it thin owne necligence. For fortune may neuer compellen the Thi good to spende but at thi liberte. CXXIII Loue the peny as for cheuysaunce, Nat for the coyn to hoord it vp on heepe. For of the prynte was maad an ordinaunce Nat for it shuld in coffres lye and sleepe, But for it shuld among the peple leepe In ther eschaunge. Who kepith it inne As for the fourme, is soget vnto synne. CXXIV Whan thou hast plente and art pecuniall, I meene, whan thou hast grete suffisaunce, Off mony foisoun and of helthe but smalle, Than spende thi monay and thi selfe avaunce. Keepe neuer thy coyn and lyve in grevaunce. The seek hathe siluer in ful grete excesse, But of hymsilfe hathe he no sikirnesse. CXXV Thouh somtyme thou suffre the grete sharpnesse Off betyng, yit thi maistres chastisment Take weel in gree withe lowly humblenesse, Sith it is doo al in good entente To cause the lore and wisdom for to hente. And thouh his woordis sownen ful of ire, Yit suffre thou the talent of that sire. CXXVI Also, my child, thou shalt the occupye To werche thynges, that ben profitable. But look thy wittis thou neuer applie To thyng that may nat ben aduaylable. To caste a thyng, that is nat profetable, By wit or strengthe, it is but grete errour: Dispeired hope is ende of suche labour. CXXVII Whan thou shalt yive, than yive in freendly wise. Frely content a prayere of requeste; For thyng yoven be tyme is yoven twise. Sith gladsom cheer makith yiftis richeste, Who yiveth gladly and soone yeveth beste. Lo, no thyng may bettir freende conquere Than man to leene, that he may weel forber. CXXVIII Whan in a thyng thou haste a coniecture, As in thi conceyt holdyng it suspecte, To discusse that thyng a-non do thi cure. For at the first whan such thyng is reiecte, The reste is aftir esy to correcte; And thyng, that at the firste is nat sett by, Is oftyn seyn to greven fynally. CXXIX And whan thou arte disposid inwardli To Venus actis, than represse corage. Fostre nat thi fleessh to lustily. For grete diete makethe the flessh outrage, Where-as mesure myht cause it asswage. And glotenye is clepid cheeff promotrice, Leedyng the fleissh to wantounnesse and vice. CXXX The ranpaund leoun and the tigre felle, The irous boor, the hound ful of envye And bestis moo than nedithe heer to telle Men dreede ful sore and fer herr tyrannye; And wel thei do. But yit oon best I espye, That is to feryn most in especial: Mann ys the beste, that thou moste dreeden shall. CXXXI The vertu, that is clepid fortitude, Stondith nat alle in strengthis bodyly, As to be virous, myhti, strong and rude; But in the soule it must ben sikirly. Than, if thou wilt thi-selfe fortifie Thi soule withynne acqueynte with sapience; And than shalt thow be strong in existence. CXXXII What thyng in erthe thou shalt take on honde, And thi supporte shal be in freendlynesse. No strange wiht on lyue so nyh wol the stonde As thi knowen ffrende, my child, this is expresse; Off the straungier haste thou no sikirnesse. For whan all othir ben ful ferr to seche, The feitheful knowe freende kan beste be thi leche. CXXXIII The deethe of bestis, that beth vnresounable, As bi custom and riht of sacrifice To purgyn the, is no seth greable. Trust nat as so to gete thy reprise; For thei, that trust so, ben ful vnwise. Bi dethe of bestis God wil nat queemyd be, And man a-bide in his iniquite. CXXXIV Whan thou wolt chese a freende for trustynesse, Than of his fortune make noon inquiraunce; For fortune is moodir of changeabilnesse. Aske of his liffe and of his gouernaunce; For that is preeff of grettir suffisaunce Than vre or fortune, that is casuell. For liff of man his fortune dothe excell. CXXXV Vse weel the richesse, that thou hast of queste. Off avarise the wikkid name eschewe. Lat nat thi good be stoppid in a chest. Keepe nat thy stuff ay closid stille in mewe. Suche old tresour wol make thi shame ful newe. What profitethe plente of grete tresur And in pouerte a wrecche alway endure. CXXXVI Iff thou desir to reioisen thi fame In honeste, whil thou lyvest heere, Eschiew the thinges, that may cause shame. Likerous lustis must be leid on beer And thinges fele, that ful ioyous appeer. This worldis ioye is ay ful deffectyfe: Be war of ioye, that hurteth thi good liffe. CXXXVII And ay, my child, conceyve and aduertise, That neuer thou skorne feeble stoupyng age. Thi elderis, my child, for nothyng thou despise, Thouh in ther wittis thei be natt so sage As in ther youth, sith age is outrage. Whan age cometh, this is sothe certeyn, A man begynneth to ben a chyld a-geyn CXXXVIII Enforce thi wittes somwhat for to lere; Acqueynte the withe connyng. For that is sure, Iff fortune chaunge and than pouert appeer, Who that hathe konnyng, is likly to recure. Konnyng and crafte remayne and endure; And bi them a man may him-silfe releve, Whan fortune hathe caste hym in to myscheeffe. CXXXIX Be stille in silens with a-visenesse. Tary, my child, til othir men han seid; So shalt thou lerne somwhat in sothfastnesse. Latt nat thy tonge sodenly be vnteid; For that myht the of hastynesse abreid. Bi manys woord his maner wil be schewed. Bi woord is knowen the wise man from þe lewid. CXL Thouh in konnyng thou have ful grete conceit, Enforce the ay yit to lerne more. The soule it is, that must be the receit; Replenissh hir with that tresour and stor. Vse makithe maistrie; vse konnyng therfore. Vse helpethe art, and cure helpithe the witte; Than vse and cure to konnyng moste be knitte. CXLI Body from soule must haue disseueraunce. Dethe is ende comoun to euery wiht. Charge nat to muche therfore of dethis chaunce; The tribut of dethe must thou pay of riht. But yit bi dethe shalt thou sette more liht, Iff bi this liff thou sett no thyng expresse; It is so ful of woo and wrecchidnesse. CXLII Lere of the wise and teche the vnkunnyng. For it is vertu and ful commendable Tencrese doctryne thoruh such comonnyng. It is alway a deede charitable To lere and teche; it is ful greable To God. Doctryne kepithe vertu on lyve. Whiche ne were, doctryne soone from man shuld slyve. CXLIII Drynk nat to muche, no mor than þou maiste bere. Rewle thy-silfe bi the bridil of mesure. To muche drynke wol the annoy and dere. Surfette is euermore of helthe vnsure; And mesur makethe men in helthe endure. Whatt man is rewlid aftir lustys vile, In good astate ne may a-bide no while. CXLIV And iff hit happe the in audience An thyng to preyse, be war, that thou ne blame It eft ageyn riht in the same presence. Iff thou dispreise, comende nat eek the same; Off suche trauers must needis risen shame. To preisen now and eft to blame douteles It is a thynge of grete vnstabilnesse. CXLV Whan thou lyuest heer riht at thyn owne ese In al thy ioye, rest and prosperite, Thynk the per-case aduersite may sese; For welthe stondithe nat in sykirte. And also soone, whan any aduersite Assautethe the, yit fall nat in dispeire; Thynke in thi-silfe: good fortune may repeire. CXLVI It is ful fair, my child, to be prudent And wys; looke thou lere ther-fore. To lerne ay, my sone, do thyn entent. Bi diligent bysynesse wisdom is more. Wisdom is she, that may nat be forbore. The rare prudence, that folkes nyce refuse, Can nat ben had but bi processe and vse. CXLVII Beware alway, that thou neuer enhaunce In thi lawde or preisyng a wiht to hihe; For thou mayste haue cause eft to dissavaunce The same. But ay thy preysyng modifie. For att oon day thou shalt ful wele espye, Whether he be freende, that freendly seemythe; For all be nat freendis, that men demethe. CXLVIII Be nat asshamed, my child, also to lere, That thou canst nat; for it is but a tecche Off foly nat to desire doctryne heere. Ful wel is he, that to konnyng may strecche, Sithe konnyngles a man is but a wrecche. To konne moche is riht comendable And nouht to konne is ay reproveable. CXLIX The soleyn stille oft meenethe fraude and gile; Off such a man eschewe the companye. For the stille man compassethe othir while Withynne his herte disceit and trecherye. In floodis stille is watir deep and hihe. In stremys softe seemyng to thy plesaunce Ofte betidithe ful vnhappy chaunce. CL With thi fortune whan thou art discontent And kanst nat take in gree thin aduenture, Behold and feele in thin aduisement, How thei, that whilom wer as thou as sur And more likly in welthe for to endure Bothe fore bounte and eek for noblesse, And yit haue falle doun into wrecchidnesse. CLI Attempte the thyng, so as thou maist suffise. Passe nat thi myht. Bere nat to hihe thi saile; Ther is pereil, if that the storme a-rise. Serteyn, my child, this is withouten faile: The vessel smalle is at ful grete a-vaile, Whan with his ore to londe he may a-reche, Where-as the sailes hihe ful oft go to wrecche. CLII A-geyns the trewe iuste man brawle nat ne stryve; For to God a-boue that is displesaunce. Trust this trewly: heer is no man on lyve, That to the iuste man dothe dere or greuaunce, But at the laste God wol take vengeaunce. And heerof it is good heed to take: The riht-wiseman of God is nat forsake. CLIII Iff extorsioun or mysauenture Haue plukked at the and maad the threedbare Off richesse, yit do thou thi force and cure. To be mery and eschewe thouht and care. For fretyng thouht is a ful cursid snare; Cum nat ther-in. Fortune is vnstable. Aftir pouerte richesse is preignable. CLIV Venus is reedi to all hir actis vile, Whan he, Bachus, hathe set hir in largesse The tresour of his hoote and feruent yle. Therfore, my child, thin appetite represse. In wynes hoote doo nat to grete excesse. Drynk, that for thi soule is expedient. Eschewe stryffe. Withe mesure be content. CLV It is an harme the goodes to forgoo, That ben on hande, bi force and violence. But yit, my child, thou most considre, who And what he is, that dothe the such offense. Bi-twix freend and foo haue ay a difference; For in som case thou most a freend forbere And suffre hym, thouh he annoy and deere. CLVI Be nat to sure, that thou shalt lyue heer long. A wyht shal deye, alle be he lothe or leeffe; And as the old so deye the yonge a-monge. Dethe stelithe on, as dothe a pryvy theefe. Loo, a-yens dethe men fynde no releeffe. She is a-boute to make a devorse And folwethe ay the shadwe of the corse. CLVII Serue ay thi God withe lowly obseruaunce, Withe herte entier, withe swete smellyng encense; Such sacrifice is moost to his plesaunce. Off calues smale, that neuer dede offence, Thouh thou hem sle, the blood may nat dispence. With the lat hem growe and swynke in þi plouhe. Thin herte to God is suffisant i-nouh. CLVIII Yiff place to hym, that excedith thy myht; Thouh thou be hurt, it may profette perchaunce. And seeld availethe a man for to fiht Ageyns such on, as passith his pusaunce. Thouh he greve now, yit efte he may avaunce. Ful oftyn is seyn aftir the grete duresse The myhty man wol kithe his gentilnesse CLIX Aftir thy surffet and thi grete offence Chastice thi-silfe, correcte, that is a-mys, Correcte thi gilte, amende thi necligence. Sorwe for synne a verray medycyne is. Repent the sore; than art thou saufe iwis. For fisik seithe, my child, I the ensure: A bittir drynk the sharpe sekenesse may cure. CLX Yff thou haue founde longe frenship in a wyht Ful yore ago, thouh he begynne to chaunge, Dispreise hym nat; men bide nat in oon pliht. Somtyme was an abbey, ther is now a graunge. This worldis cours is ful queynte and strange. But thouh the man as now be wax vnkynde, His olde frenship remembr in thi mynde. CLXI Iff it vre the in office to be sette, Than be thou gracious to othir men. Thei may report: a goodly man is mette With such office; and so good fame shal renne A-boute of the. But I ensure the, whenne Thofficer is vnkynde, than seithe the pres: Now wold God this man were officeles. CLXII Be nat suspect; that is a wikkid tecche. The suspect wiht with cowarde ielousnesse In his lyvyng is but a verray wrecche. Much is a-mys, and all wold he redresse. Hee deemythe fals and failethe hertynesse. His fals conceyt, set in malencolye, Slethe hym a-noon; deth endithe his folye. CLXIII Iff thou haue men withouten liberte, Such as be clepid the men of bondage, Thouh thei ben vndir thi captyuyte, Yit ouer such men be neuer outrage, Iff thei be holden vndir thy seruage. Thouh thei be bonde, yit verray men thei be. That thei be men, than ay remembre the CLXIV Thi first fortune receyve withe reedynesse; Refuse it nat, thouh it be scant and smalle. It is wele bettir in gree to take the lesse, Than refuse it and aftir faile of alle. Yiftis of fortune take them as thei falle. Forsake hem nowe, and efte thou shalt haue neede. Tyme is to take, whan men profere and beede. CLXV Reioyse thou neuer, my child, in al thi lyve The sodeyn dethe of a cursid man and wrecche. Whan he is deede, the soule may nat revive; Fro peyne to ioye that spirit may nat strecche; The feendis holdyn so sore, that thei may kecche. Who lyuethe wele, ful wele eeke deyethe he; That soule is sykir of grete felicite. CLXVI Iff thou haue a wiffe in assuraunce, Than trust hir weele and love hir inwardlye Withe herte and thouht and al thyn affiaunce. Be nat infecte with suspecte ielousye. Iff no deffaute in hir thou kanst espye And if thi freend telle the, suche is the fame, He is a freend and she nothyng to blame. CLXVII Whan thoruh stody and longe excersyce Thou knowest mochil and hast grete konnyng, Yit do thy diligence in besy wyse More to konne; it is an holsom thyng. To grete honour konnyng may the bryng. And ay eschewe nat for to be tawhte. Withoute techyng science wol nat be kawhte. CLXVIII And if thou ouht meruayle and lest to muse, In nakid woordis, why my verse I write, In no wise I may me bettir excuse, Than sey: my witt so dul and vnparfite Artith me thus rudely for tendite. Bi too and too my metre for to knytte Nat causethe me but sympilnesse of witte. Explicit secundum Magistrum Benedictum credo</field>
