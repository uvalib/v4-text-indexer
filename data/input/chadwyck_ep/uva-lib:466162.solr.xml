      <field name="fulltext">JUVENILIA. THE BATTLE OF MARATHON. A POEM. 1820. TO HIM, TO WHOM “I OWE THE MOST,” AND WHOSE ADMONITIONS HAVE GUIDED MY YOUTHFUL MUSE EVEN FROM HER EARLIEST INFANCY, TO THE FATHER, WHOSE NEVER-FAILING KINDNESS, WHOSE UNWEARIED AFFECTION I NEVER CAN REPAY, I OFFER THESE PAGES, AS A SMALL TESTIMONY OF THE GRATITUDE OF HIS AFFECTIONATE CHILD, ELIZABETH B. BARRETT. Hope End: 1819. “Behold What care employs me now, my vows I pay To the sweet Muses, teachers of my youth!” —Akenside. “Ancient of days! August Athena! Where, Where are thy men of might, thy grand in soul? Gone—glimmering through the dream of things that were. First in the race that led to glory's goal, They won, and passed away.” —Byron. BOOK I. The war of Greece with Persia's haughty King, No vulgar strain, eternal Goddess, sing! What dreary ghosts to glutted Pluto fled, What nations suffered, and what heroes bled: Sing Asia's powerful Prince, who envious saw The fame of Athens, and her might in war; And scorns her power, at Cytherea's call Her ruin plans, and meditates her fall; How Athens, blinded to the approaching chains By Vulcan's artful spouse, unmoved remains; Deceived by Venus thus, unconquered Greece Forgot her glories in the lap of peace; While Asia's realms, and Asia's lord prepare T' ensnare her freedom, by the wiles of war: Hippias t' exalt upon th' Athenian throne, Where once Pisistratus his father shone. For yet her son Æneas' wrongs impart Revenge and grief to Cytherea's heart; And still from smoking Troy's once sacred wall, Does Priam's reeking shade for vengeance call. Minerva saw, and Paphia's Queen defied, A boon she begged, nor Jove the boon denied; That Greece should rise, triumphant o'er her foe, Disarm th' invaders, and their power o'erthrow. Her prayer obtained, the blue-eyed Goddess flies As the fierce eagle, thro' the radiant skies. To Aristides then she stood confessed, Shews Persia's arts, and fires his warlike breast: Then pours celestial ardour o'er his frame And points the way to glory and to fame. Awe struck the Chief, and swells his troubled soul, In pride and wonder thoughts progressive roll. He inly groaned and smote his labouring breast, At once by Pallas, and by care opprest. Inspired he moved, earth echoed where he trod, All full of Heaven, all burning with the God. Th' Athenians viewed with awe the mighty man, To whom the Chief impassioned thus began: “Hear, all ye Sons of Greece! Friends, Fathers, hear! The Gods command it, and the Gods revere! No madness mine, for mark, oh favoured Greeks! That by my mouth the martial Goddess speaks! This know, Athenians, that proud Persia now Prepares to twine thy laurels on her brow; Behold her princely Chiefs their weapons wield By Venus fired, and shake the brazen shield. I hear their shouts that echo to the skies, I see their lances blaze, their banners rise, I hear the clash of arms, the battle's roar, And all the din and thunder of the war! I know that Greeks shall purchase just renown, And fame impartial, shall Athena crown. Then Greeks, prepare your arms! award the yoke, Thus Jove commands”—sublime the hero spoke; The Greeks assent with shouts, and rend the skies With martial clamour, and tumultuous cries. So struggling winds with rage indignant sweep The azure waters of the silent deep, Sudden the seas rebellowing, frightful rise, And dash their foaming surges to the skies; Burst the firm sand, and boil with dreadful roar, Lift their black waves, and combat with the shore. So each brave Greek in thought aspires to fame, Stung by his words, and dread of future shame; Glory's own fires within their bosom rise And shouts tumultuous thunder to the skies. But Love's celestial Queen resentful saw The Greeks (by Pallas warned) prepare for war; Th' indignant Goddess of the Paphian bower Deceives Themistocles with heavenly power; The hero rising spoke, “Oh rashly blind, What sudden fury thus has seized thy mind? Boy as thou art, such empty dreams beware! Shall we, for griefs and wars unsought, prepare? The will of mighty Jove, whate'er it be, Obey, and own th' Omnipotent decree. If our disgrace and fall the fates employ, Why did we triumph o'er perfidious Troy? Why, say, oh Chief, in that eventful hour Did Grecian heroes crush Dardanian power?” Him eyeing sternly, thus the Greek replies, Renowned for truth, and as Minerva wise, “Oh Son of Greece, no heedless boy am I, Despised in battle's toils, nor first to fly, Nor dreams or phrenzy call my words astray, The heaven-sent mandate pious I obey. If Pallas did not all my words inspire, May heaven pursue me with unceasing ire! But if (oh grant my prayer, almighty Jove) I bear a mandate from the Courts above, Then thro' yon heaven, let awful thunder roar Till Greeks believe my mission, and adore!” He ceased—and thro' the host one murmur ran, With eyes transfixed upon the godlike man. But hark! o'er earth expands the solemn sound, It lengthening grows—heaven's azure vaults resound, While peals of thunder beat the echoing ground. Prostrate, convinc'd, divine Themistocles Embraced the hero's hands, and clasped his knees: “Behold me here, (the awe-struck Chieftain cries While tears repentant glisten in his eyes,) “Behold me here, thy friendship to entreat, Themistocles, a suppliant at thy feet. Before no haughty despot's royal throne This knee has bent—it bends to thee alone Thy mission to adore, thy truth to own. Behold me Jove, and witness what I swear By all on earth I love, by all in heav'n I fear, Some fiend inspired my words, of dark design, Some fiend concealed beneath a robe divine; Then aid me in my prayer, ye Gods above, Bid Aristides give me back his love!” He spake and wept; benign the godlike man Felt tears descend and paused, then thus began, “Thrice worthy Greek, for this shall we contend? Ah no! I feel thy worth, thou more than friend, Pardon sincere, Themistocles, receive; The heart declares 'tis easy to forgive.” He spake divine, his eye with Pallas burns, He spoke and sighed, and sighed and wept by turns. Themistocles beheld the Chief opprest, Awe-struck he paused, then rushed upon his breast, Whom sage Miltiades with joy addressed. “Hero of Greece, worthy a hero's name Adored by Athens, fav'rite child of fame! Glory's own spirit does with truth combine To form a soul, so godlike, so divine! Oh Aristides rise, our Chief! to save The fame, the might of Athens from the grave. Nor then refuse thy noble arm to lend To guard Athena, and her state defend. First I, obedient, 'customed homage pay To own a hero's and a leader's sway.” He said, and would have knelt; the man divine Perceived his will, and stayed the Sire's design. “Not mine, oh Sage, to lead this gallant band,” He generous said, and grasped his aged hand, “Proud as I am in glory's arms to rise, Athenian Greeks, to shield your liberties, Yet 'tis not mine to lead your powerful state, Enough it is to tempt you to be great; Be't for Miltiades, experienced sage, To curb your ardour, and restrain your rage, Your souls to temper—by his skill prepare To succour Athens, and conduct the war. More fits my early youth to purchase fame, By deeds in arms t' immortalize my name.” Firmly he spake, his words the Greek inspire, And all were hushed to listen and admire. The Sage thus—“Most Allied to Gods! the fame, The pride, the glory of the Grecian name, E'en by thee, Chief, I swear, to whom is given The sacred mandate of yon marble heaven— To lead, not undeserving of thy love, T' avert the yoke, if so determines Jove.” Amidst the host imagination rose And paints the combat, but disdains the woes. And heaven-born fancy, with dishevelled hair, Points to the ensanguined field, and victory there. But soon, too soon, these empty dreams are driven Forth from their breasts—but soothing hope is given, Hope sprung from Jove, man's sole, and envied heav'n. Then all his glory, Aristides felt, And begged the Chieftain's blessing as he knelt: Miltiades his pious arms outspread, Called Jove's high spirit on the hero's head, Nor called unheard—sublime in upper air The bird of Jove appeared to bless his prayer. Lightning he breathed, not harsh, not fiercely bright, But one pure stream of heaven-collected light: Jove's sacred smile lulls every care to rest, Calms every woe, and gladdens every breast. But what shrill blast thus bursts upon the ear; What banners rise, what heralds' forms appear? That haughty mien, and that commanding face Bespeak them Persians, and of noble race; One on whose hand Darius' signet beamed, Superior to the rest, a leader seemed, With brow contracted, and with flashing eye Thus threatening spoke, in scornful majesty: “Know Greeks that I, a sacred herald, bring The awful mandate of the Persian King, To force allegiance from the Sons of Greece, Then earth and water give, nor scorn his peace. For, if for homage, back reproof I bear, To meet his wrath, his vengeful wrath, prepare, For not in vain ye scorn his dread command When Asia's might comes thundering in his hand.” To whom Miltiades with kindling eye, “We scorn Darius, and his threats defy; And now, proud herald, shall we stoop to shame? Shall Athens tremble at a tyrant's name? Persian away! such idle dreams forbear, And shun our anger and our vengeance fear.” “Oh! vain thy words,” the herald fierce began; “Thrice vain thy dotaged words, oh powerless man, Sons of a desert, hoping to withstand All the joint forces of Darius' hand, Fools, fools, the King of millions to defy, For freedom's empty name, to ask to die! Yet stay, till Persia's powers their banners rear, Then shall ye learn our forces to revere, And ye, oh impotent, shall deign to fear!” To whom great Aristides: rising ire Boiled in his breast, and set his soul on fire: “Oh wretch accurst,” the hero cried, “to seek T' insult experienced age, t' insult a Greek! Inglorious slave! whom truth and heaven deny, Unfit to live, yet more unfit to die: But, trained to pass the goblet at the board And servile kiss the footsteps of thy lord, Whose wretched life no glorious deeds beguile, Who lives upon the semblance of a smile, Die! thy base shade to gloomy regions fled, Join there the shivering phantoms of the dead. Base slave, return to dust”—his victim then In fearful accents cried, “Oh best of men, Most loved of Gods, most merciful, most just, Behold me humbled, grovelling in the dust: Not mine th' offence, the mandate stern I bring From great Darius, Asia's tyrant King. Oh strike not, Chief, not mine the guilt, not mine, Ah o'er those brows severe, let mercy shine, So dear to heav'n, of origin divine! Tributes, lands, gold, shall wealthy Persia give, All, and yet more, but bid me, wretched, live!” He trembling, thus persuades with fond entreat And nearer prest, and clasped the hero's feet. Forth from the Grecian's breast, all rage is driv'n, He lifts his arms, his eyes, his soul to heav'n. “Hear, Jove omnipotent, all wise, all great, To whom all fate is known; whose will is fate; Hear thou all-seeing one, hear Sire divine, Teach me thy will, and be thy wisdom mine! Behold this suppliant! life or death decree; Be thine the judgment, for I bend to thee.” And thus the Sire of Gods and men replies, While pealing thunder shakes the groaning skies. The awful voice thro' spheres unknown was driv'n Resounding thro' the dark'ning realms of heaven. Aloft in air sublime the echo rode, And earth resounds the glory of the God: “Son of Athena, let the coward die, And his pale ghost, to Pluto's empire fly; Son of Athena, our command obey, Know thou our might, and then adore our sway.” Th' Almighty spake—the heavens convulsive start, From the black clouds the whizzing lightnings dart And dreadful dance along the troubled sky Struggling with fate in awful mystery. The hero heard, and Jove his breast inspired Nor now by pity touched, but anger fired; While his big heart within his bosom burns, Off from his feet the clinging slave he spurns. Vain were his cries, his prayers 'gainst fate above, Jove wills his fall, and who can strive with Jove? To whom the hero—“Hence to Pluto's sway, To realms of night, ne'er lit by Cynthia's ray, Hence, from yon gulph the earth and water bring And crown with victory your mighty King.” He said—and where the gulph of death appeared Where raging waves, with rocks sublimely reared, He hurled the wretch at once of hope bereaved; Struggling he fell, the roaring flood received. E'en now for life his shrieks, his groans implore, And now death's latent agony is o'er, He struggling sinks, and sinks to rise no more. The train amaz'd, behold their herald die, And Greece in arms—they tremble and they fly; So some fair herd upon the verdant mead See by the lion's jaws their foremost bleed, Fearful they fly, lest what revolving fate Had doomed their leader, should themselves await. Then shouts of glorious war, and fame resound, Athena's brazen gates receive the lofty sound. But she whom Paphia's radiant climes adore From her own bower the work of Pallas saw: Tumultuous thoughts within her bosom rise, She calls her car, and at her will it flies. Th' eternal car with gold celestial burns, Its polished wheel on brazen axle turns: This to his spouse by Vulcan's self was given An offering worthy of the forge of heav'n. The Goddess mounts the seat, and seized the reins, The doves celestial cut the aerial plains, Before the sacred birds and car of gold Self-moved the radiant gates of heav'n unfold. She then dismounts, and thus to mighty Jove Begins the Mother and the Queen of Love. “And is it thus, oh Sire, that fraud should spring From the pure breast of heaven's eternal King? Was it for this, Saturnius' word was given That Greece should fall 'mong nations curst of heaven? Thou swore by hell's black flood, and heaven above, Is this, oh say, is this the faith of Jove? Behold stern Pallas, Athens' Sons alarms, Darius' herald crushed, and Greece in arms. E'en now behold her crested streamers fly, Each Greek resolved to triumph or to die: Ah me unhappy! when shall sorrow cease; Too well I know the fatal might of Greece; Was't not enough, imperial Troy should fall, That Argive hands should raze the god-built wall? Was't not enough Anchises' Son should roam Far from his native shore and much loved home? All this unconscious of thy fraud I bore, For thou, oh Sire, t' allay my vengeance, swore That Athens towering in her might should fall And Rome should triumph on her prostrate wall; But oh, if haughty Greece should captive bring The great Darius, Persia's mighty King, What power her pride, what power her might shall move? Not e'en the Thunderer, not eternal Jove, E'en to thy heav'n shall rise her towering fame, And prostrate nations will adore her name. Rather on me thy instant vengeance take Than all should fall for Cytherea's sake! Oh! hurl me flaming in the burning lake, Transfix me there unknown to Olympian calm, Launch thy red bolt, and bare thy crimson arm. I'd suffer all—more—bid my woes increase To hear but one sad groan from haughty Greece.” She thus her grief with fruitless rage expressed, And pride and anger swelled within her breast. But he whose thunders awe the troubled sky Thus mournful spake, and curbed the rising sigh: “And it is thus celestial pleasures flow? E'en here shall sorrow reach and mortal woe? Shall strife the heavenly powers for ever move And e'en insult the sacred ear of Jove? Know, oh rebellious, Greece shall rise sublime In fame the first, nor, daughter, mine the crime, In valour foremost, and in virtue great, Fame's highest glories shall attend her state. So fate ordains, nor all my boasted power Can raise those virtues, or those glories low'r: But rest secure, destroying time must come And Athens' self must own imperial Rome.” Then the great Thunderer, and with visage mild, Shook his ambrosial curls before his child, And bending awful gave the eternal nod; Heav'n quaked, and fate adored the parent God. Joy seized the Goddess of the smiles and loves, Nor longer, care, her heavenly bosom moves. Hope rose, and o'er her soul its powers displayed, Nor checked by sorrow, nor by grief dismayed. She thus—“Oh thou, whose awful thunders roll Thro' heaven's etherial vaults and shake the Pole, Eternal Sire, so wonderfully great, To whom is known the secret page of fate, Say, shall great Persia, next to Rome most dear To Venus' breast, shall Persia learn to fear? Say, shall her fame, and princely glories cease? Shall Persia, servile, own the sway of Greece?” To whom the Thunderer bent his brow divine And thus in accents heavenly and benign; “Daughter, not mine the secrets to relate, The mysteries of all-revolving fate. But ease thy breast; enough for thee to know, What powerful fate decrees, will Jove bestow!” He then her griefs, and anxious woes beguiled, And in his sacred arms embraced his child. Doubt clouds the Goddess' breast—she calls her car, And lightly sweeps the liquid fields of air. When sable night midst silent nature springs, And o'er Athena shakes her drowsy wings, The Paphian Goddess from Olympus flies, And leaves the starry senate of the skies; To Athens' heaven-blest towers, the Queen repairs To raise more sufferings, and to cause more cares; The Pylian Sage she moved so loved by fame, In face, in wisdom, and in voice the same. Twelve Chiefs in sleep absorbed and grateful rest She first beheld, and them she thus addrest. “Immortal Chiefs,” the fraudful Goddess cries, While all the hero kindled in her eyes, “For you, these aged arms did I employ, For you, we razed the sacred walls of Troy, And now for you, my shivering shade is driven From Pluto's dreary realms by urgent Heaven; Then, oh be wise, nor tempt th' unequal fight In open fields, but wait superior might Within immortal Athens' sacred wall, There strive, there triumph, nor there fear to fall; To own the Thunderer's sway, then Greeks prepare.” Benign she said, and melted into air. BOOK II. When from the briny deep, the orient morn Exalts her purple light, and beams unshorn; And when the flaming orb of infant day Glares o'er the earth, and re-illumes the sky; The twelve deceived, with souls on fire arose, While the false vision fresh in memory glows; The Senate first they sought, whose lofty wall Midst Athens rises, and o'ershadows all; The pride of Greece, it lifts its front sublime Unbent amidst the ravages of time: High on their towering seats, the heroes found The Chiefs of Athens solemn ranged around; One of the twelve, the great Clombrotus, then, Renowned for piety, and loved by men: “Assembled heroes, Chief to Pallas dear, All great in battle, and in virtue, hear! When night with sable wings extended rose And wrapt our weary limbs in sweet repose, I and my friends, Cydoon famed in song, Thelon the valiant, Herocles the strong, Cleon and Thermosites, in battle great By Pallas loved, and blest by partial fate, To us and other six, while day toils steep Our eyes in happy dreams, and grateful sleep, The Pylian Sage appeared, but not as when On Troy's last dust he stood, the pride of men; Driven from the shore of Acheron he came From lower realms to point the path to fame, ‘Oh glorious Chiefs,’ the sacred hero said, ‘For you and for your fame, all Troy has bled; Hither for you, my shivering shade is driv'n From Pluto's dreary realms by urgent Heav'n; Then oh be wise, nor tempt th' unequal fight In open field, but wait superior might Within immortal Athens' sacred wall; There strive, there triumph, nor there fear to fall! To own the Thunderer's sway, then Greeks prepare.’ Benign he said, and melted into air. ‘Leave us not thus’ I cried, ‘Oh Pylian Sage, Experienced Nestor, famed for reverend age, Say first, great hero, shall the trump of fame Our glory publish, or disclose our shame? Oh what are Athens' fates?’ In vain I said; E'en as I spoke the shadowy Chief had fled. Then here we flew, to own the vision's sway And heaven's decrees to adore and to obey.” He thus—and as before the blackened skies, Sound the hoarse breezes, murmuring as they rise, So thro' th' assembled Greeks, one murmur rose, One long dull echo lengthening as it goes. Then all was hushed in silence—breathless awe Opprest each tongue, and trembling they adore. But now uprising from th' astonished Chiefs, Divine Miltiades exposed his griefs, For well the godlike warrior Sage had seen The frauds deceitful of the Paphian Queen, And feared for Greece, for Greece to whom is given Eternal fame, the purest gift of heaven. And yet he feared—the pious hero rose Majestic in his sufferings, in his woes; Grief clammed his tongue, but soon his spirit woke, Words burst aloft, and all the Patriot spoke. “Oh Athens, Athens! all the snares I view; Thus shalt thou fall, and fall inglorious too! Are all thy boasted dignities no more? Is all thy might, are all thy glories o'er? Oh woe on woe, unutterable grief! Not Nestor's shade, that cursed phantom chief, But in that reverend air, that lofty mien, Behold the frauds of Love's revengeful Queen. Not yet, her thoughts does vengeance cease t' employ; Her Son Æneas' wrongs, and burning Troy Not yet forgotten lie within her breast, Nor soothed by time, nor by despair deprest. Greeks still extolled by glory and by fame, For yet, oh Chiefs! ye bear a Grecian name, If in these walls, these sacred walls we wait The might of Persia, and the will of fate, Before superior force will Athens fall And one o'erwhelming ruin bury all. Then in the open plain your might essay, Rush on to battle, crush Darius' sway; The frauds of Venus, warrior Greeks, beware, Disdain the Persian foes, nor stoop to fear.” This said, Clombrotus him indignant heard, Nor felt his wisdom, nor his wrath he feared. With rage the Chief, the godlike Sage beheld, And passion in his stubborn soul rebelled. “Thrice impious man,” th'infuriate Chieftain cries, (Flames black and fearful, flashing from his eyes,) “Where lies your spirit, Greeks? and can ye bow To this proud upstart of your power so low? What! does his aspect awe ye! is his eye So full of haughtiness and majesty? Behold the impious soul, that dares defy The power of Gods and Sovereign of the sky! And can your hands no sacred weapon wield, To crush the tyrant, and your country shield? On, Greeks!—your sons, your homes, your country free From such usurping Chiefs and tyranny!” He said, and grasped his weapon—at his words Beneath the horizon gleamed ten thousand swords, Ten thousand swords e'en in one instant raised, Sublime they danced aloft, and midst the Senate blazed. Nor wisdom checked, nor gratitude represt, They rose, and flashed before the Sage's breast. With pride undaunted, greatness unsubdued, 'Gainst him in arms, the impetuous Greeks he viewed, Unarmed, unawed, before th' infuriate bands, Nor begged for life, nor stretched his suppliant hands. He stood astounded, riveted, oppressed By grief unspeakable, which swelled his breast; Life, feeling, being, sense forgotten lie, Buried in one wide waste of misery. Can this be Athens! this her Senate's pride? He asked but gratitude,—was this denied? Tho' Europe's homage at his feet were hurled Athens forsakes him—Athens was his world. Unutterable woe! by anguish stung All his full soul rushed heaving to his tongue, And thoughts of power, of fame, of greatness o'er, He cried “Athenians!” and he could no more. Awed by that voice of agony, that word, Hushed were the Greeks, and sheathed the obedient sword, They stood abashed—to them the ancient Chief Began—and thus relieved his swelling grief: “Athenians! warrior Greeks! my words revere! Strike me, but listen—bid me die, but hear! Hear not Clombrotus, when he bids you wait, At Athens' walls, Darius and your fate; I feel that Pallas' self, my soul inspires My mind she strengthens, and my bosom fires; Strike, Greeks! but hear me; think not to this heart Yon thirsty swords, one breath of fear impart! Such slavish, low born thoughts, to Greeks unknown, A Persian feels, and cherishes alone! Hear me, Athenians! hear me, and believe, See Greece mistaken! e'en the Gods deceive. But fate yet wavers—yet may wisdom move These threatening woes and thwart the Queen of Love. Obey my counsels, and invoke for aid The cloud-compelling God, and blue-eyed maid; I fear not for myself the silent tomb, Death lies in every shape, and death must come. But ah! ye mock my truth, traduce my fame, Ye blast my honor, stigmatize my name! Ye call me tyrant when I wish thee free, Usurper, when I live but, Greece, for thee!” And thus the Chief—and boding silence drowned Each clam'rous tongue, and sullen reigned around. “Oh Chief!” great Aristides first began, “Mortal yet perfect, godlike and yet man! Boast of ungrateful Greece! my prayer attend, Oh! be my Chieftain, Guardian, Father, Friend! And ye, oh Greeks! impetuous and abhorred, Again presumptuous, lift the rebel sword, Again your weapons raise, in hateful ire, To crush the Leader, Hero, Patriot, Sire! Not such was Greece, when Greeks united stood To bathe perfidious Troy in hostile blood, Not such were Greeks inspired by glory; then As Gods they conquered, now they're less than men! Degenerate race! now lost to once loved fame, Traitors to Greece, and to the Grecian name! Who now your honors, who your praise will seek? Who now shall glory in the name of Greek? But since such discords your base souls divide, Procure the lots, let Jove and Heaven decide.” To him Clombrotus thus admiring cries, “Thy thoughts how wondrous, and thy words how wise! So let it be, avert the threatened woes, And Jove be present, and the right disclose; But give me, Sire of Gods and powers above, The heavenly vision, and my truth to prove! Give me t' avenge the breach of all thy laws, T' avenge myself, then aid my righteous cause! If this thou wilt, I'll to thine altars lead Twelve bulls which to thy sacred name shall bleed, Six snow-white heifers of a race divine Prostrate shall fall, and heap the groaning shrine. Nor this the most—six rams that fearless stray Untouched by man, for thee this arm shall slay.” Thus prayed the Chief, with shouts the heavens resound; Jove weighs the balance and the lots go round! Declare, oh muse! for to thy piercing eyes The book of fate irrevocably lies; What lots leapt forth, on that eventful day Who won, who lost, all seeing Goddess, say! First great Clombrotus all his fortune tried And strove with fate, but Jove his prayer denied. Infuriate to the skies his arms are driven, And raging thus upbraids the King of Heaven. “Is this the virtue of the blest abodes, And this the justice of the God of Gods? Can he who hurls the bolt, and shakes the sky The prayer of truth, unblemished truth, deny? Has he no faith by whom the clouds are riven, Who sits superior on the throne of Heaven? No wonder earth-born men are prone to fall In sin, or listen to dishonor's call, When Gods, th' immortal Gods, transgress the laws Of truth, and sin against a righteous cause.” Furious he said, by anger's spirit fired, Then sullen from the Senate walls retired. 'Tis now Miltiades' stern fate to dare, But first he lifts his pious soul in prayer. “Daughter of Jove!” the mighty Chief began, “Without thy wisdom, frail and weak is man. A phantom Greece adores; oh show thy power, And prove thy love in this eventful hour! Crown all thy glory, all thy might declare!” The Chieftain prayed, and Pallas heard his prayer. Swayed by the presence of the power divine, The fated lot, Miltiades, was thine! That hour the swelling trump of partial fame Diffused eternal glory on thy name! “Daughter of Jove,” he cries, “unconquered maid! Thy power I own, and I confess thy aid, For this twelve ewes upon thy shrine shall smoke Of milk-white fleece, the comeliest of their flock. While hecatombs and generous sacrifice Shall fume and blacken half th' astonished skies.” And thus the Chief—the shouting Greeks admire, While truth's bright spirit sets their souls on fire. Then thus Themistocles, “Ye Grecian host, Not now the time for triumph or for boast. Now, Greeks! for graver toils your minds prepare, Not for the strife, but council of the war. Behold the sacred herald! sent by Greece To Sparta's vales now hushed in leagues of peace; Her Chiefs, to aid the common cause, t' implore, And bid Darius shun the Argive shore; Behold him here! then let the leader Greek Command the bearer of our hopes to speak.” And thus the Sage, “Where'er the herald stands, Bid him come forth, 'tis Athens' Chief commands, And bid him speak with freedom uncontrolled, His thoughts deliver and his charge unfold.” He said and sat—the Greeks impatient wait The will of Sparta, and Athena's fate. Silent they sat—so ere the whirlwinds rise Ere billows foam and thunder to the skies, Nature in death-like calm her breath suspends, And hushed in silent awe, th' approaching storm attends. Now midst the Senate's walls the herald stands: “Ye Greeks,” he said, and stretched his sacred hands, “Assembled heroes, ye Athenian bands, And thou beloved of Jove, our Chief, oh Sage, Renowned for wisdom, as renowned for age, And all ye Chiefs in battle rank divine! No joyful mission swayed by Pallas mine. The hardy Spartans, with one voice declare Their will to aid our freedom and our war, Instant they armed, by zeal and impulse driven, But on the plains of the mysterious heaven Comets and fires were writ—and awful sign, And dreadful omen of the wrath divine: While threatened plagues upon their shores appear, They curb their valor, all subdued by fear; The oracles declare the will above, And of the sister and the wife of Jove, That not until the moon's bright course was o'er The Spartan warriors should desert their shore. Threats following threats succeed the mandate dire, Plagues to themselves, and to their harvest fire. The Spartan Chiefs desist, their march delay To wait th' appointed hour and heaven obey. Grief smote my heart, my hopes and mission vain; Their town I quitted for my native plain, And when an eminence I gained, in woe I gazed upon the verdant fields below, Where nature's ample reign extending wide, Displays her graces with commanding pride; Where cool Eurotas winds her limpid floods Thro' verdant valleys, and thro' shady woods; And crowned in majesty o'ertowering all In bright effulgence, Sparta's lofty wall. To these I looked farewell, and humbled, bowed In chastened sorrow, to the thundering God. 'Twas thus I mused, when from a verdant grove That wafts delicious perfume from above, The monster Pan his form gigantic reared, And dreadful to my awe-struck sight appeared. I hailed the God who reigns supreme below, Known by the horns that started from his brow; Up to the hips a goat, but man's his face Tho' grim, and stranger to celestial grace. Within his hand a shepherd's crook he bore The gift of Dian, on th' Arcadian shore; Before th' immortal power I, fearing, bowed Congealed with dread, and thus addressed the God: ‘Comes Hermes' Son, as awful as his Sire, To vent upon the Greeks immortal ire? Is't not enough, the mandate stern I bring From Sparta's Chiefs, and Sparta's royal King, That heaven enjoins them to refrain from fight Till Dian fills again her horns with light? Then vain their aid, ere then may Athens fall And Persia's haughty Chiefs invest her wall.’ I said and sighed, the God in accents mild My sorrow thus and rigid griefs beguiled: ‘Not to destroy I come, oh chosen Greek, Not Athens' fall, but Athens' fame I seek. Then give again to honor and to fame My power despised, and my forgotten name. At Sparta's doom, no longer, Chief, repine, But learn submission to the will divine; Behold e'en now, within this fated hour On Marathonian plains, the Persian power! E'en Hippias' self inspires th' embattled host, Th' Athenian's terror, as the Persian's boast. Bid Athens rise and glory's powers attest. Enough—no more—the fates conceal the rest.’ He said, his visage burned with heavenly light; He spoke and, speaking, vanished from my sight; And awed, I sought where those loved walls invite. But think not, warrior Greeks, the fault is mine, If Athens fall—it is by wrath divine. I vainly, vainly grieve, the evil springs From him—the God of Gods, the King of Kings!” The Herald said, and bent his sacred head, While cherished hope from every bosom fled. Each dauntless hero, by despair deprest Felt the deep sorrow, swelling in his breast. They mourn for Athens, friendless and alone; Cries followed cries, and groan succeeded groan. Th' Athenian matrons, startled at the sound, Rush from their looms and anxious crowd around. They ask the cause, the fatal cause is known By each fond sigh, and each renewing groan, While in their arms some infant love they bear At once for which they joy, for which they fear. Hushed on its mother's breast, the cherished child Unconscious midst the scene of terror smiled; On rush the matrons, they despairing seek Miltiades, adored by every Greek; Him found at length, his counsels they entreat, Hang on his knees and clasp his sacred feet. Their babes before him on the ground they throw In all the maddening listlessness of woe. First Delopeia, of the matrons chief, Thus vents her bursting soul in frantic grief, While her fond babe she holds aloft in air; Thus her roused breast prefers a mother's prayer: “Oh Son of Cimon, for the Grecians raise To heaven, thy fame, thy honor, and thy praise. Thus—thus—shall Athens and her heroes fall, Shall thus one ruin seize and bury all? Say, shall these babes be strangers then to fame, And be but Greeks in spirit and in name? Oh first, ye Gods! and hear a mother's prayer, First let them glorious fall in ranks of war! If Asia triumph, then shall Hippias reign And Athens' free-born Sons be slaves again! Oh Son of Cimon! let thy influence call The souls of Greeks to triumph or to fall! And guard their own, their children's, country's name, From foul dishonor, and eternal shame!” Thus thro' her griefs, the love of glory broke, The mother wept, but 'twas the Patriot spoke: And as before the Greek she bowed with grace, The lucid drops bedewed her lovely face. Their shrieks and frantic cries the matrons cease, And death-like silence awes the Sons of Greece. Thrice did the mighty Chief of Athens seek To curb his feelings and essay to speak, 'Twas vain—the ruthless sorrow wrung his breast, His mind disheartened, and his soul opprest. He thus—while o'er his cheek the moisture stole, “Retire ye matrons, nor unman my soul! Tho' little strength this aged arm retains, My swelling soul Athena's foe disdains; Hushed be your griefs, to heav'n for victory cry, Assured we'll triumph, or with freedom die. And ye, oh Chiefs, when night disowns her sway And pensive Dian yields her power to day, To quit these towers for Marathon prepare, And brave Darius in the ranks of war. For yet may Jove protect the Grecian name And crown, in unborn ages, Athens' fame.” He said—and glowing with the warlike fire, And cheered by hope, the Godlike Chiefs retire. Now Cynthia rules the earth, the flaming God In ocean sinks, green Neptune's old abode; Black Erebus on drowsy pinions springs, And o'er Athena cowers his sable wings. BOOK III. When from the deep the hour's eternal sway Impels the coursers of the flaming day, The long haired Greeks, with brazen arms prepare, Their freedom to preserve and wage the war. First Aristides from the couch arose, While his great mind with all Minerva glows; His mighty limbs, his golden arms invest, The cuirass blazes on his ample breast, The glittering cuisses both his legs enfold, And the huge shield's on fire with burnished gold; His hands two spears uphold of equal size, And fame's bright glories kindle in his eyes; Upon his helmet, plumes of horse hair nod, And forth he moved, majestic as a God! Upon his snorting steed the warrior sprung, The courser neighed, the brazen armour rung; From heaven's etherial heights the martial maid With conscious pride, the hero's might surveyed. Him as she eyed, she shook the gorgon shield; “Henceforth to me,” she cried, “let all th' immortals yield. Let monster Mars, the Latian regions own, For Attica, Minerva stands alone.” And now, th' unconquered Chief of Justice gains The Senate's walls, and there the steed detains, Whence he dismounts—Miltiades he seeks, Beloved of Jove, the leader of the Greeks, Nor sought in vain; there clad in armour bright The Chieftain stood, all eager for the fight. Within his aged hands two lances shine, The helmet blazed upon his brows divine, And as he bends beneath th' unequal weight Youth smiles again, when with gigantic might His nervous limbs, immortal arms could wield, Crush foe on foe, and raging, heap the field. Yet tho' such days were past, and ruthless age Transformed the warrior to the thoughtful sage; Tho' the remorseless hand of silent time Impaired each joint, and stiffened every limb; Yet thro' his breast, the fire celestial stole, Throbbed in his veins, and kindled in his soul. In thought, the Lord of Asia threats no more, And Hippias bites the dust, mid seas of gore. Him as he viewed, the youthful hero's breast Heaved high with joy, and thus the Sage addressed: “Chief, best beloved of Pallas,” he began, “In fame allied to Gods, oh wondrous man! Behold Apollo gilds th' Athenian wall, Our freedom waits, and fame and glory call To battle! Asia's King and myriads dare, Swell the loud trump, and swell the din of war.” He said impatient; then the warrior sage Began, regardless of the fears of age: “Not mine, oh youth, with caution to controul The fire and glory of thy eager soul; So was I wont in brazen arms to shine, Such strength, and such impatient fire were mine.” He said, and bade the trumpet's peals rebound, High, and more high, the echoing war notes sound: Sudden one general shout the din replies, A thousand lances blazing as they rise, And Athens' banners wave, and float along the skies. So from the marsh, the cranes embodied fly, Clap their glad wings, and cut the liquid sky. With thrilling cries they mount their joyful way, Vig'rous they spring, and hail the new born day. So rose the shouting Greeks, inspired by fame T' assert their freedom, and maintain their name. First came Themistocles in arms renowned, Whose steed impatient, tore the trembling ground. High o'er his helmet snowy plumes arise And shade that brow, which Persia's might defies; A purple mantle graceful waves behind, Nor hides his arms but floats upon the wind. His mighty form two crimson belts enfold Rich in embroidery, and stiff with gold. Callimachus the Polemarch next came, The theme of general praise and general fame. Cynagirus, who e'en the Gods would dare, Heap ranks on ranks and thunder thro' the war; His virtues godlike; man's his strength surpassed, In battle foremost, and in flight the last; His ponderous helm's a shaggy lion's hide, And the huge war axe clattered at his side. The mighty Chief, a brazen chariot bore, While fame and glory hail him and adore. Antenor next his aid to Athens gave, Like Paris youthful, and like Hector brave; Cleon, Minerva's priest, experienced sage, Advanced in wisdom, as advanced in age. Agregoras, Delenus' favorite child; The parent's cares, the glorious son beguiled. But now he leaves his sire to seek his doom, His country's freedom, or a noble tomb. And young Aratus moved with youthful pride, And heart elated at the hero's side. Next thou, Cleones, thou triumphant moved By Athens honoured, by the Greeks beloved: And Sthenelus the echoing pavements trod, From youth devoted to the martial God. Honor unspotted crowned the hero's name, Unbounded virtue, and unbounded fame. Such heroes shone the foremost of the host, All Athens' glory, and all Athens' boast. Behind a sable cloud of warriors rise With ponderous arms, and shouting rend the skies. These bands with joy Miltiades inspire, Fame fills his breast, and sets his soul on fire. Aloft he springs into the gold-wrought car, While the shrill blast resounds, to war! to war! The coursers plunge as conscious of their load And proudly neighing, feel they bear a God. The snow white steeds by Pallas' self were given, Which sprung from the immortal breed of heaven. The car was wrought of brass and burnished gold, And divers figures on its bulk were told, Of heroes who in plunging to the fight Shrouded Troy's glories in eternal night: Of fierce Pelides, who relenting gave, At Priam's prayer, to Hector's corpse a grave; Here Spartan Helen flies her native shore, To bid proud Troy majestic stand no more; There Hector clasps his consort to his breast, Consoles his sufferings, tho' himself oppressed; And there he rushes to the embattled field For victory or death, nor e'en in death to yield: Here Ilium prostrate feels the Argive ire, Her heroes perished, and her towers on fire. And here old Priam breathes his last drawn sigh, And feels 'tis least of all his griefs to die. There his loved sire, divine Æneas bears, And leaves his own with all a patriot's tears; While in one hand he holds his weeping boy, And looks his last on lost unhappy Troy. The warrior seized the reins, the impatient steeds Foam at the mouth and spring where glory leads. The gates, the heroes pass, th' Athenian dames Bend from their towers, and bid them save from flames Their walls, their infant heirs, and fill the skies With shouts, entreaties, prayers, and plaintive cries: Echo repeats their words, the sounds impart New vigour to each Greek's aspiring heart. Forward with shouts they press, and hastening on Try the bold lance and dream of Marathon. Meanwhile the Persians on th' embattled plain Prepare for combat, and the Greeks disdain. Twice twenty sable bulls they daily pay, Unequalled homage, to the God of day; Such worthy gifts, the wealthy warriors bring, And such the offerings of the Persian King; While the red wine around his altars flowed They beg protection from the flaming God. But the bright Patron of the Trojan war Accepts their offerings, but rejects their prayer: The power of love alone dares rigid fate, To vent on Greece her vengeance and her hate; Not love for Persia prompts the vengeful dame, But hate for Athens, and the Grecian name: In Phœbus' name, the fraudful Queen receives The hecatombs, and happy omens gives. And now the heralds with one voice repeat The will of Datis echoing thro' the fleet, To council, to convene the Persian train, That Athens' Chiefs should brave their might in vain. The Chiefs and Hippias' self his will obey, And seek the camp, the heralds lead the way. There on the couch, their leader Datis sat In ease luxurious, and in kingly state; Around his brow, pride deep and scornful played, A purple robe, his slothful limbs arrayed, Which o'er his form, its silken draperies fold, Majestic sweeps the ground, and glows with gold; While Artaphernes resting at his side Surveys th' advancing train with conscious pride. The Elder leader, mighty Datis, then, “Assembled Princes, great and valiant men, And thou thrice glorious Hippias, loved by heav'n, To whom, as to thy Sire, is Athens giv'n; Behold the Grecian banners float afar, Shouting they hail us, and provoke the war. Then, mighty Chiefs and Princes, be it yours To warm and fire the bosoms of our powers, That when the morn has spread her saffron light, The Greeks may own and dread Darius' might; For know, oh Chiefs, when once proud Athens falls, When Persian flames shall reach her haughty walls, From her depression, wealth to you shall spring, And honor, fame and glory to your King.” He said; his words the Princes' breasts inspire, Silent they bend, and with respect retire. And now the Greeks in able marches gain, By Pallas fired, the Marathonian plain. Before their eyes th' unbounded ocean rolls And all Darius' fleet—unawed their souls, They fix their banners, and the tents they raise And in the sun, their polished javelins blaze. Their leader's self within the brazen car Their motions orders, and prepares for war; Their labors o'er, the aged hero calls The Chiefs to council midst the canvas walls, And then the Sage, “How great the Persian host! But let them not their strength or numbers boast. Their slothful minds to love of fame unknown, Sigh not for war, but for the spoil alone. Strangers to honor's pure immortal light, They not as heroes, but as women fight; Grovelling as proud, and cowardly as vain, The Greeks they fear, their numbers they disdain. And now Athenians! fired by glory, rise And lift your fame unsullied to the skies, Your victim Persia, liberty your prize. And now twice twenty sable bullocks bring To heap the altars of the thundering King, Bid twelve white heifers of gigantic breed To Jove's great daughter, wise Minerva, bleed, And then in sleep employ the solemn night Nor till Apollo reigns, provoke the fight.” The hero said; the warlike council o'er They raise the lofty altars on the shore. They pile in heaps the pride of all the wood; They fall the first, who first in beauty stood: The pine that soars to heaven, the sturdy oak, And cedars crackle at each hero's stroke. And now two altars stand of equal size And lift their forms majestic to the skies, The heroes then twice twenty bullocks bring, A worthy offering to the thundering King. The aged leader seized the sacred knife, Blow followed blow, out gushed the quivering life; Thro' their black hides the ruthless steel is driven The victims groan—Jove thunders from his heaven. And then their bulks upon the pile they lay, The flames rush upward, and the armies pray. Driven by the wind, the roaring fires ascend, And now they hiss in air, and now descend; With all their sap, the new cut faggots raise Their flames to heaven, and crackle as they blaze; And then the Sage, “Oh, thou of powers above The first and mightiest, hear, eternal Jove! Give us, that Athens in her strength may rise And lift our fame and freedom to the skies!” This said, he ceased—th' assembled warriors pour The sacred incense, and the God adore; Then partial Jove propitious heard their prayer, Thrice shook the heavens, and thundered thro' the air; With joy, the Greeks, the favoring sign inspires, And their breasts glow with all the warlike fires: And now twelve heifers white as snow they lead To great Minerva's sacred name to bleed. They fall—their bulks upon the pile are laid Sprinkled with oil, and quick in flame arrayed. And now descending midst the darkening skies Behold the Goddess of the radiant eyes. The ground she touched, beneath the mighty load Earth groaning rocks, and nature hails the God. Within her hand her father's lightnings shone, And shield that blazes near th' eternal throne; The Greeks with fear, her dauntless form surveyed, And trembling bowed before the blue-eyed maid. Then favoring, thus began the power divine, While in her eyes celestial glories shine; “Ye sons of Athens, loved by heaven,” she cries “Revered by men, be valiant and be wise. When morn awakes, Darius' numbers dare, Clang your loud arms, and rouse the swelling war: But first to yon proud fleet a herald send To bid the Persians yield, and fight suspend, For vainly to their God they suppliant call, Jove favors Greece, and Pallas wills their fall.” She said, and thro' the depths of air she flies, Mounts the blue heaven, and scales the liquid skies. The Greeks rejoicing thank the powers above And Jove's great daughter, and eternal Jove. And now a herald to the fleet they send To bid the Persians yield, and war suspend. Thro' the divided troops the herald goes Thro' Athens' host, and thro' th' unnumbered foes. Before the holy man, the Persian bands Reverend give way, and ask what Greece demands: He tells not all, but that he, chosen, seeks Datis their Chief, by order of the Greeks. The mission but in part he sage reveals, And what his prudence prompts him, he conceals. Then to their Chief they lead him, where he sat With pomp surrounded, and in gorgeous state; Around his kingly couch, his arms were spread Flaming in gold, by forge Cyclopean made; And then stern Datis frowning thus began, “What hopes deceive thee, miserable man? What treacherous fate allures thee thus to stray Thro' all our hosts? What Gods beguile the way? Think'st thou to 'scape the Persian steel, when Greece Our herald crushed, and banished hopes of peace? But speak, what will the Greeks? and do they dare To prove our might, and tempt th' unequal war? Or do they deign to own Darius' sway And yield to Persia's might th' embattled day?” To whom th' Athenian herald made reply “The Greeks disdain your terms, and scorn to fly. Unknown to heroes and to sons of Greece The shameful slavery of a Persian peace; Defiance stern, not servile gifts I bring, Your bonds detested, and despised your King; Of equal size, the Greeks two altars raise To Jove's high glory, and Minerva's praise. The God propitious heard, and from the skies Descends the Goddess of the azure eyes, And thus began—‘Assembled Greeks, give ear Attend my wisdom, nor my glory fear; When morn awakes, Darius' numbers dare, Clang your loud arms, and rouse the swelling war: But first to yon proud fleet a herald send To bid the Persians yield, and war suspend, For vainly to their God they suppliant call, Jove favors Greece, and Pallas wills their fall.’ The Goddess spoke; th' Athenians own her sway. I seek the fleet, and heaven's command obey. The Greeks disdain your millions in the war, Nor I, oh Chief, your promised vengeance fear. Strike! but remember that the God on high Who rules the heavens, and thunders thro' the sky, Not unrevenged will see his herald slain, Nor shall thy threats his anger tempt in vain.” And thus the Greek: then Datis thus replies, Flames black and fearful scowling from his eyes, “Herald away! and Asia's vengeance fear; Back to your phrenzied train my mandate bear, That Greece and Grecian Gods may threat in vain, We scorn their anger, and their wrath disdain: For he who lights the earth and rules the skies With happy omens to our vows replies. When morn uprising breathes her saffron light, Prepare to dare our millions in the fight. Thy life I give, Darius' will to say And Asia's hate—hence, Chief, no more, away!” He said, and anger filled the Grecian's breast, But prudent, he the rising wrath suppressed; Indignant, thro' the canvas tents he strode And silently invoked the thundering God. Fears for his country in his bosom rose, As on he wandered midst unnumbered foes; He strikes his swelling breast and hastens on O'er the wide plains of barren Marathon. And now he sees the Grecian banners rise, And well-armed warriors blaze before his eyes. Then thus he spoke—“Ye Grecian bands, give ear, Ye warrior Chiefs and Attic heroes hear! Your will to Asia's other Prince I told, All which you bade me, Chieftains, to unfold, But Pallas' vengeance I denounced in vain, Your threats he scorned, and heard with proud disdain. The God, he boasts, who lights the earth and skies, With happy omens to his vows replies; Then when the uprising morn extends her light Prepare, ye Greeks, to dare his powers in fight.” He said—the Greeks for instant strife declare Their will, and arm impatient for the war. Then he, their godlike Chief, as Pallas sage, “Obey my counsels, and repress your rage, Ye Greeks,” he cried, “the sacred night displays Her shadowy veil, and earth in gloom arrays; Her sable shades, e'en Persia's Chiefs obey, And wait the golden mandate of the day: Such is the will of Jove, and Gods above, And such the order of the loved of Jove.” He said—the Greeks their leader's word obey, They seek their tents, and wait th' approaching day, O'er either host celestial Somnus reigns, And solemn silence lulls th' embattled plains. BOOK IV. And now the morn by Jove to mortals given With rosy fingers opes the gates of heaven. The Persian Princes and their haughty Lord Gird on their arms, and seize the flaming sword: Forth, forth they rush to tempt the battle's roar, Earth groans, and shouts rebellowing shake the shore. As when the storm the heavenly azure shrouds With sable night, and heaps on clouds, the clouds, The Persians rose, and crowd th' embattl'd plain And stretch their warlike millions to the main; And now th' Athenians throng the fatal field By fame inspired, and swords and bucklers wield; In air sublime their floating banners rise, The lances blaze; the trumpets rend the skies. And then Miltiades—“Athenians, hear, Behold the Persians on the field appear Dreadful in arms; remember, Greeks, your fame, Rush to the war, and vindicate your name; Forward! till low in death the Persians lie, For freedom triumph or for freedom die.” He said; his visage glows with heavenly light; He spoke sublime, and rush'd into the fight. And now the fury of the way [So the original; query, day or fray?] began— Lance combats lance, and man's opposed to man; Beneath their footsteps, groans the laboring plain And shouts re-echoing bellow to the main; Mars rages fierce; by heroes, heroes die; Earth rocks, Jove thunders, and the wounded cry. What mighty Chiefs by Aristides fell, What heroes perished, heavenly Goddess, tell, First thou, oh Peleus! felt his conquering hand, Stretched in the dust and weltering in the sand, Thro' thy bright shield, the forceful weapon went, Thyself in arms o'erthrown, thy corslet rent; Next rash Antennes met an early fate, And feared, alas! th' unequal foe too late; And Delucus the sage, and Philo fell, And Crotan sought the dreary gates of hell, And Mnemon's self with wealth and honor crowned, Revered for virtue, and for fame renowned; He, great in battle, feared the hero's hand, Groaning he fell, and spurned the reeking sand. But what bold chief thus rashly dares advance? Tho' not in youth, he shakes the dreadful lance, Proudly the earth the haughty warrior trod, He looked a Monarch and he moved a God: Then on the Greek with rage intrepid flew And with one blow th' unwary Greek o'erthrew; That hour, oh Chief, and that eventful day Had bade thee pass a shivering ghost away, But Pallas, fearful for her fav'rite's life, Sudden upraised thee to renew the strife; Then Aristides with fresh vigour rose, Shame fired his breast, his soul with anger glows, With all his force he rushes on the foe, The warrior bending disappoints the blow, And thus with rage contemptuous, “Chieftain, know, Hippias, the loved of heaven, thine eyes behold, Renowned for strength of arm, in battle bold, But tell thy race, and who the man whose might Dares cope with rebel Athens' King in fight.” Stung to the soul, “Oh Slave,” the Greek returns, While his big heart within his bosom burns, “Perfidious Prince, to faith and truth unknown; On Athens' ashes, raise thy tyrant throne, When Grecia's chiefs, and Grecia's heroes fall, When Persia's fires invest her lofty wall, When nought but slaves within her towers remain, Then, nor till then, shalt thou, oh Hippias, reign, Then, nor till then, will Athens yield her fame To foul dishonor, and eternal shame; Come on! no matter what my race or name; For this, oh Prince, this truth unerring know, That in a Greek, you meet a noble foe.” Furious he said, and on the Prince he sprung With all his force, the meeting armour rung, Struggling they raged, and both together fell. That hour the tyrant's ghost had entered hell, But partial fate prolonged the Prince's breath, Renewed the combat, and forbad the death. Meanwhile the hosts, the present war suspend, Silent they stand, and heaven's decree attend. First the bright lance majestic Hippias threw But erringly the missile weapon flew; Then Aristides hurled the thirsty dart, Struck the round shield, and nearly pierced his heart, But the bright arms, that shone with conscious pride, Received the blow, and turned the point aside. And thus, the Greek, “Whom your enquiring eyes Behold, oh Prince,” th' Athenian hero cries, “Is Aristides, called the just, a name By Athens honored, nor unknown to fame.” Scared at the sound, and seized by sudden fright, The Prince starts back, in mean, inglorious flight. And now Bellona rages o'er the field, All strive elated, all disdain to yield; And great Themistocles in arms renowned, Stretched heaps of heroes on the groaning ground. First by his hand fell Delos' self, divine, The last loved offspring of a noble line, Straight thro' his neck the reeking dart was driven, Prostrate he sinks, and vainly calls to heaven. Next godlike Phanes, midst the Persians just, Leucon and mighty Caudos bit the dust; And now the Greek, with pride imprudent, dares Victorious Mandrocles renowned in wars. The agile Persian swift avoids the blow Furious disarms and grasps th' unequal foe! Th' intrepid Greek, with godlike calm awaits His instant fall, and dares th' impending fates, But great Cynœgirus his danger spies And lashed his steeds, the ponderous chariot flies, Then from its brazen bulk, he leaps to ground, Beneath his clanging arms the plains resound, And on the Persian rushes fierce, and raised The clattering axe on high, which threatening blazed, And lopped his head; out spouts the smoking gore And the huge trunk rolled bleeding on the shore. And then Cynœgirus, “Thus, Persian, go And boast thy victory in the shades below, A headless form, and tell who bade thee bleed, For know a Greek performed the wonderous deed: But thou, Themistocles, oh hero! say Who bade thee rush, to tempt th' unequal fray? But learn from this, thy daring to restrain, And seek less mighty foes upon the plain.” With secret wrath the youthful hero burned And thus impetuous to the Chief returned; “Such thoughts as these, unworthy those who dare The battle's rage, and tempt the toils of war; Heedless of death, and by no fears opprest, Conquest my aim, I leave to heaven the rest.” He said, and glowed with an immortal light, Plunged 'midst the foes, and mingled in the fight. Zeno the bravest of the Persian youth Renowned for filial piety and truth; His mother's only joy; she loved to trace His father's features in his youthful face; That Sire, in fight o'erwhelmed, mid seas of gore Slept unentombed, and cared for fame no more. And now as youth in opening manhood glows, All his loved father in his visage rose, Like him, regardful of his future fame, Resolved like him to immortalize his name, At glory's call, he quits his native shore And feeble parent, to return no more; Oh! what prophetic griefs her bosom wrung When on his neck in agony she hung! When on that breast she hid her sorrowing face, And feared to take, or shun, the last embrace! Unhappy youth! the fates decree thy doom, Those flowers, prepared for joy, shall deck thy tomb. Thy mother now no more shall hail thy name So high enrolled upon the lists of fame, Nor check the widow's tear, the widow's sigh, For e'en her son, her Zeno's doom to die. Zeno, e'en thou! for so the Gods decree, A parents' threshold opes no more for thee! On him the hero turned his eye severe Nor on his visage saw one mark of fear; There manly grace improved each separate part, And joined by ties of truth, the face and heart. The supple javelin then the Grecian tries With might gigantic, and the youth defies. Its point impetuous, at his breast he flung, The brazen shield received, and mocking rung; Then Zeno seized the lance, the Chief defied, And scoffing, thus began, in youthful pride; “Go, mighty Greek! to weaker warriors go, And fear this arm, and an unequal foe; A mother gave the mighty arms I bear, Nor think with such a gift, I cherish fear.” He hurled the lance, but Pallas' self was there, And turned the point, it passed in empty air. With hope renewed, again the hero tries His boasted might, the thirsty weapon flies In Zeno's breast it sinks, and drank the gore, And stretched the hero vanquished on the shore; Gasping for utterance, and life, and breath, For fame he sighs, nor fears approaching death. Themistocles perceived, and bending low Thought of his friends, and tears began to flow That washed the bleeding bosom of his foe. Young Zeno then, the Grecian hero eyed Rejects his offered aid, and all defied, Breathed one disdainful sigh, and turned his head and died. Such Persians did the godlike warrior slay, And bade their groaning spirits pass away. Epizelus, the valiant and the strong, Thundered in fight, and carried death along; Him not a Greek in strength of arms surpassed, In battle foremost, but in virtue last. He, impious man, to combat dared defy The Gods themselves, and senate of the sky, E'en earth and heaven, and heaven's eternal sire, He mocks his thunders, and disdains his ire. But now the retributive hour is come, And rigid justice seals the Boaster's doom. Theseus he sees, within the fight, revealed To him alone—to all the rest concealed. To punish guilt, he leaves the shades below And quits the seat of never ending woe. Pale as in death, upon his hands he bore Th' infernal serpent of the dreadful shore, To stay his progress should he strive to fly From Tart'rus far, and gain the upper sky. This (dreadful sight!) with slippery sinews now Wreathed round his form, and clasped his ghastly brow; With horror struck, and seized with sudden awe The Greek beheld, nor mingled in the war. Withheld from combat by the force of fear, He trembling thus—“Oh say, what God draws near? But speak thy will, if 'tis a God, oh speak! Nor vent thy vengeance on a single Greek.” Vainly he suppliant said—o'erpowered with fright, And instant from his eyeballs fled the sight; Confused, distracted, to the skies he throws His frantic arms, and thus bewails his woes: “Almighty! thou by whom the bolts are driven!” He said, and cast his sightless balls to heav'n, “Restore my sight, unhappy me, restore My own loved offspring, to behold once more! So will I honor thy divine abodes, And learn how dreadful th' avenging Gods! And if—but oh forbid! you mock my prayer And cruel fate me ever cursed declare, Give me, to yield to fame alone my life And fall immortalised,—in glorious strife!” He said—the God who thunders thro' the air, Frowns on his sufferings and rejects his prayer. Around his form the dreadful Ægis spread And darts fall harmless on his wretched head; Condemned by fate in ceaseless pain to groan, Friendless, in grief, in agony alone. Now Mars and death pervade on every side And heroes fall, and swell the crimson tide. Not with less force th' Athenian leader shone In strife conspicuous, nor to fame unknown, Advanced in wisdom, and in honored years, He nor for life, but for the battle fears. Borne swift as winds within the flying car Nowhere, now there, directs the swelling war, On every side the foaming coursers guides, Here praises valour, and there rashness chides; While from his lips persuasive accents flow T' inspire th' Athenians, or unman the foe. The glorious Greeks rush on, with daring might And shout and thunder, and encrease the fight. Nor yet inglorious do the Persians shine, In battle's ranks they strength and valour join. Datis himself impels the ponderous car Thro' broken ranks, conspicuous in the war, In armour sheathed, and terror round him spread He whirls his chariot over heaps of dead; Where'er he dreadful rushes, warriors fly, Ghosts seek their hell, and chiefs and heroes die. All pale with rage he ranks on ranks o'erthrows, For blood he gasps, and thunders midst his foes. Callimachus the mighty leader found In fight conspicuous, bearing death around. The lance wheeled instant from the Persian's hand Transfixed the glorious Grecian in the sand. Fate ends the hero's life, and stays his breath And clouds his eyeballs with the shade of death: Erect in air the cruel javelin stood, Pierced thro' his breast, and drank the spouting blood. Released from life's impending woes and care, The soul immerges in the fields of air: Then, crowned with laurels, seeks the blest abodes Of awful Pluto, and the Stygian floods. And now with joy great Aristides saw Again proud Hippias thundering thro' the war, And mocking thus, “Oh tyrant, now await The destined blow, behold thy promised fate! Thrice mighty King, obey my javelin's call For e'en thy godlike self's decreed to fall;” He said, and hurled the glittering spear on high, The destined weapon hissed along the sky; Winged by the hero's all-destroying hand It pierced the Prince, and stretched him on the sand. Then thro' the air the awful peals were driven And lightnings blazed along the vast of heaven. The Persian hosts behold their bulwark die, Fear chills their hearts, and all their numbers fly, And reached the fleet; the shouting Greeks pursue All Asia's millions, flying in their view. On, on, they glorious rush, and side by side Yet red with gore, they plunge into the tide; For injured freedom's sake, th' indignant main With swelling pride receives the crimson stain; The Persians spread the sail, nor dare delay, And suppliant call upon the King of day, But vainly to their Gods the cowards pray. Some of the ships th' Athenian warriors stay And fire their bulks; the flames destroying rise, Rushing they swell, and mount into the skies. Foremost Cynœgirus with might divine, While midst the waves his arms majestic shine; With blood-stained hand a Persian ship he seized, The vessel vainly strove to be released; With fear the crew the godlike man beheld, And pride and shame their troubled bosoms swelled. They lop his limb; then Pallas fires his frame With scorn of death, and hope of future fame: Then with the hand remaining seized the prize, A glorious spirit kindling in his eyes. Again the Persians wield the unmanly blow And wreck their vengeance on a single foe. The fainting Greek by loss of blood opprest Still feels the patriot rise within his breast. Within his teeth the shattered ship he held, Nor in his soul one wish for life rebelled. But strength decaying, fate supprest his breath, And o'er his brows expand the dews of death. The Elysium plains his generous spirit trod, “He lived a Hero and he died a God.” By vengeance fired, the Grecians from the deep With rage and shouting, scale the lofty ship, Then in the briny bosom of the main They hurl in heaps the living and the slain. Thro' the wide shores resound triumphant cries, Fill all the seas, and thunder thro' the skies. AN ESSAY ON MIND, WITH OTHER POEMS. 1826. “Brama assai, poco spera, e nulla chiede.” —Tasso. AN ESSAY ON MIND. “My narrow leaves cannot in them contayne The large discourse.” —Spenser. BOOK I. ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST BOOK. The poem commences by remarking the desire, natural to the mind, of investigating its own qualities—qualities the more exalted, as their developement has seldom been impeded by external circumstances—The various dispositions of different minds are next considered, and are compared to the varieties of scenic nature; inequalities in the spiritual not being more wonderful than inequalities in the natural—Byron and Campbell contrasted— The varieties of genius having been thus treated, the art of criticism is briefly alluded to, as generally independent of genius, but always useful to its productions—Jeffrey —The various stages of life in which genius appears, and the different causes by which its influence is discovered—Cowley, Alfieri —Allusion to the story of the emotion of Thucydides on hearing Herodotus recite his History at the Olympic Games—The elements of Mind are thus arranged, Invention, Judgment, Memory, and Association—The creations of mind are next noticed, among which we first behold Philosophy—History, Science, and Metaphysics, are included in the studies of Philosophy. Of History, it is observed, that though on a cursory view her task of recalling the past may appear of little avail, it is in reality one of the highest importance—The living are sent for a lesson to the grave—The present state of Rome alluded to; and the future state of England anticipated—Condemnation of those who deprive historical facts of their moral inference, and only make use of their basis to render falsehood more secure— Gibbon—Condemnation of those who would colour the political conduct of past ages with their own political feelings—Hume, Mitford —From the writers, we turn to the readers of history—Their extreme scepticism, or credulity—They are recommended to be guided by no faction; but to measure facts by their consistency with reason—to study the personal character and circumstances of an historian, before they give entire credit to his representations—The influence of private feeling and prejudice—Miller—Science is introduced —Apostrophe to man—Episode of Archimedes—Parallel between history and science—The pride of the latter considered most excessive—The risk attending knowledge —Buffon, Leibnitz—The advantageous experience to be derived from the errors of others, illustrated by an allusion to Southey's Hexameters—Utility the object of science— An exclusive attention to parts deprecated, since it is impossible even to have a just idea of parts, without acquiring a knowledge of their relative situation in the whole—The extreme difficulty of enlarging the contemplations of a mind long accustomed to contracted views—The scale of knowledge— every science being linked with the one preceding and succeeding—giving and receiving reciprocal support—Why this system is not calculated, as might be conjectured, either to render scientific men superficial, or to intrude on the operations of genius—That the danger of knowledge originates in partial knowledge—Apostrophe to Newton. Since Spirit first inspir'd, pervaded all, And Mind met Matter, at th' Eternal call— Since dust weigh'd Genius down, or Genius gave Th' immortal halo to the mortal's grave; Th' ambitious soul her essence hath defin'd, And Mind hath eulogiz'd the pow'rs of Mind. Ere Revelation's holy light began To strengthen Nature, and illumine Man— When Genius, on Icarian pinions, flew, And Nature's pencil, Nature's portrait, drew; When Reason shudder'd at her own wan beam, And Hope turn'd pale beneath the sickly gleam— Ev'n then hath Mind's triumphant influence spoke, Dust own'd the spell, and Plato's spirit woke— Spread her eternal wings, and rose sublime Beyond th' expanse of circumstance and time: Blinded, but free, with faith instinctive, soar'd, And found her home, where prostrate saints ador'd! Thou thing of light! that warm'st the breasts of men, Breath'st from the lips, and tremblest from the pen! Thou, form'd at once t' astonish, fire, beguile,— With Bacon reason, and with Shakespeare smile! The subtle cause, ethereal essence! say, Why dust rules dust, and clay surpasses clay; Why a like mass of atoms should combine To form a Tully, and a Catiline? Or why, with flesh perchance of equal weight, One cheers a prize-fight, and one frees a state? Why do not I the muse of Homer call, Or why, indeed, did Homer sing at all? Why wrote not Blackstone upon love's delusion, Or Moore, a libel on the Constitution? Why must the faithful page refuse to tell That Dante, Laura sang, and Petrarch, Hell— That Tom Paine argued in the throne's defence— That Byron nonsense wrote, and Thurlow sense— That Southey sigh'd with all a patriot's cares, While Locke gave utterance to Hexameters? Thou thing of light! instruct my pen to find Th' unequal pow'rs, the various forms of Mind! O'er Nature's changeful face direct your sight; View light meet shade, and shade dissolve in light! Mark, from the plain, the cloud-capp'd mountain soar; The sullen ocean spurn the desert shore! Behold, afar, the playmate of the storm, Wild Niagara lifts his awful form— Spits his black foam above the madd'ning floods, Himself the savage of his native woods— See him, in air, his smoking torrents wheel, While the rocks totter, and the forests reel— Then, giddy, turn! lo! Shakespeare's Avon flows, Charm'd, by the green-sward's kiss, to soft repose; With tranquil brow reflects the smile of fame, And, 'midst her sedges, sighs her Poet's name. Thus, in bright sunshine, and alternate storms, Is various mind express'd in various forms. In equal men, why burns not equal fire? Why are not valleys hills,—or mountains higher? Her destin'd way, hath destin'd Nature trod; While Matter, Spirit rules, and Spirit, God. Let outward scenes, for inward sense design'd, Call back our wand'rings to the world of Mind! Where Reason, o'er her vasty realms, may stand, Convene proud thoughts, and stretch her scepter'd hand. Here, classic recollections breathe around; Here, living Glory consecrates the ground; And here, Mortality's deep waters span The shores of Genius, and the paths of Man! O'er this imagin'd land, your soul direct— Mark Byron, the Mont Blanc of intellect, 'Twixt earth and heav'n exalt his brow sublime, O'erlook the nations, and shake hands with Time! Stretch'd at his feet do Nature's beauties throng, The flow'rs of love, the gentleness of song; Above, the Avalanche's thunder speaks, While Terror's spirit walks abroad, and shrieks! To some Utopian strand, some fairy shore, Shall soft-eyed Fancy waft her Campbell o'er! Wont, o'er the lyre of Hope, his hand to fling, And never waken a discordant string; Who ne'er grows awkward by affecting grace, Or ‘Common sense confounds with commonplace;’ To bright conception, adds expression chaste, And human feeling joins to classic taste. For still, with magic art, he knows, and knew, To touch the heart, and win the judgment too! Thus, in uncertain radiance, Genius glows, And fitful gleams on various mind bestows: While Mind, exulting in th' admitted day, On various themes, reflects its kindling ray. Unequal forms receive an equal light; And Klopstock wrote what Kepler could not write. Yet Fame hath welcom'd a less noble few, And Glory hail'd whom Genius never knew; Art labour'd, Nature's birthright, to secure, And forg'd, with cunning hand, her signature. The scale of life is link'd by close degrees; Motes float in sunbeams, mites exist in cheese; Critics seize half the fame which bards receive,— And Shakespeare suffers that his friends may live; While Bentley leaves, on stilts, the beaten track, And peeps at glory from some ancient's back. “The reason which the learned Bentley gave his daughter for not himself becoming an original writer, instead of wasting his talents on the works of others, is probably the cause of many not attempting original composition. Bentley seemed embarrassed at her honest question, and remained for a considerable time thoughtful. At length he observed—Child, I am sensible I have not always turned my talents to the proper use for which they were given me; yet I have done something: but the wit and genius of the old authors beguiled me, and as I despaired of raising myself up to their standard upon fair ground, I thought the only chance I had of looking over their heads was to get upon their shoulders.” —Curiosities of Literature, Vol. I. But, though to hold a lantern to the sun Be not too wise, and were as well undone— Though, e'en in this inventive age, alas! A moral darkness can't be cur'd by gas— And, though we may not reasonably deem How poets' craniums can be turn'd by steam— Yet own we, in our juster reasonings, That lanterns, gas, and steam, are useful things— And oft, this truth, Reflection ponders o'er— Bards would write worse, if critics wrote no more. Let Jeffrey's praise, our willing pen, engage, The letter'd critic of a letter'd age! Who justly judges, rightfully discerns, With wisdom teaches, and with candour learns. His name on Scotia's brightest tablet lives, And proudly claims the laurel that it gives. Eternal Genius! fashion'd like the sun, To make all beautiful thou look'st upon! Prometheus of our earth! whose kindling smile May warm the things of clay a little while; Till, by thy touch inspir'd, thine eyes survey'd, Thou stoop'st to love the glory thou hast made; And weepest, human-like, the mortal's fall, When, by-and-bye, a breath disperses all. Eternal Genius! mystic essence! say, How, on “the chosen breast,” descends thy day! Breaks it at once in Thought's celestial dream, While Nature trembles at the sudden gleam? Or steals it, gently, like the morning's light, Shedding, unmark'd, an influence soft and bright, Till all the landscape gather on the sight? As different talents, different breasts, inspire, So different causes wake the latent fire. The gentle Cowley of our native clime, A volume of Cowley's poems was published in his fifteenth year; and contains “The Tragical History of Pyramus and Thispe,” written in his tenth. Lisp'd his first accents in Aönian rhyme. Alfieri's startling muse tun'd not her strings, This Poet's great mind exhibited no precocity. His ‘Cleopatra,’ written at the age of twenty-five years, first discovered its author's dramatic genius to himself, and to the world. And dumbly look'd “unutterable things;” Till, when six lustrums o'er his head had past, Conception found expression's voice at last; Broke the bright light, uprose the smother'd flame,— And Mind and Nature own'd their poet's fame! To some the waving woods, the harp of spring, A gently-breathing inspiration bring! Some hear, from Nature's haunts, her whisper'd call; And Mind hath triumph'd by an apple's fall. Wave Fancy's picturing wand! recall the scene Which Mind hath hallow'd—where her sons have been— Where, 'midst Olympia's concourse, simply great, Th' historic sage, the son of Lyxes, sate, Grasping th' immortal scroll—he breath'd no sound, But, calm in strength, an instant look'd around, And rose—the tone of expectation rush'd Through th' eager throng—he spake, and Greece was hush'd! See, in that breathless crowd, Olorus stand, It is said that Thucydides, in early youth, was present at the Olympic games when Herodotus recited his History; and that a burst of tears spoke his admiration. “Take care of that boy” observed the sage turning to Olorus, “he will one day make a great man!” While one fair boy hangs, list'ning, on his hand— The young Thucydides! with upward brow Of radiance, and dark eye, that beaming now Full on the speaker, drinks th' inspirëd air— Gazing entranc'd, and turn'd to marble there! Yet not to marble—for the wild emotion Is kindling on his cheek, like light on ocean, Coming to vanish; and his pulses throb With transport, and the inarticulate sob Swells to his lip—internal nature leaps To glorious life, and all th' historian weeps! The mighty master mark'd the favor'd child— Did Genius linger there? She did, and smil'd! Still, on itself, let Mind its eye direct, To view the elements of intellect— How wild Invention (daring artist!) plies Her magic pencil, and creating dies; And Judgment, near the living canvass, stands, To blend the colours for her airy hands; While Memory waits, with twilight mists o'ercast, To mete the length'ning shadows of the past: And bold Association, not untaught, The links of fact, unites, with links of thought; Forming th'electric chains, which, mystic, bind Scholastic learning, and reflective mind. Let reasoning Truth's unerring glance survey The fair creations of the mental ray; Her holy lips, with just discernment, teach The forms, the attributes, the modes of each; And tell, in simple words, the narrow span That circles intellect, and fetters man; Where darkling mists, o'er Time's last footstep, creep, And Genius drops her languid wing—to weep. See first Philosophy's mild spirit, nigh, Raise the rapt brow, and lift the thoughtful eye; Whether the glimmering lamp, that Hist'ry gave, Light her enduring steps to some lone grave; The while she dreams on him, asleep beneath, And conjures mystic thoughts of life and death— Whether, on Science' rushing wings, she sweep From concave heav'n to earth—and search the deep; Shewing the pensile globe attraction's force, The tides their mistress, and the stars their course: Or whether (task with nobler object fraught) She turn the pow'rs of thinking back on thought— With mind, delineate mind; and dare define The point, where human mingles with divine: Majestic still, her solemn form shall stand, To shew the beacon on the distant land— Of thought, and nature, chronicler sublime! The world her lesson, and her teacher Time! And when, with half a smile, and half a sigh, She lifts old History's faded tapestry, I' the dwelling of past years—she, aye, is seen Point to the shades, where bright'ning tints had been— The shapeless forms outworn, and mildew'd o'er— And bids us rev'rence what was lov'd before; Gives the dank wreath and dusty urn to fame, And lends its ashes—all she can—a name. Think'st thou, in vain, while pale Time glides away, She rakes cold graves, and chronicles their clay? Think'st thou, in vain, she counts the boney things, Once lov'd as patriots, or obey'd as kings? Lifts she, in vain, the past's mysterious veil? Seest thou no moral in her awful tale? Can man, the crumbling pile of nations, scan,— And is their mystic language mute for man? Go! let the tomb its silent lesson give, And let the dead instruct thee how to live! If Tully's page hath bade thy spirit burn, And lit the raptur'd cheek—behold his urn! If Maro's strains, thy soaring fancy, guide, That hail ‘th' eternal city’ in their pride— “Imperium sine fine dedi,” says Virgil's Jupiter. How little did the writer of those four words dream of their surviving the Glory, whose eternity they were intended to predict! Horace too, in the most exulting of his odes, boldly proclaims that his fame will live as long as“Capitolium Scandet cum tacitâ virgine Pontifex.” Yes! his fame will live!—but where now is the Pontifex, and the silent vestal? where now is the Capitol? Such passages are, to my mind, pre-eminently more affecting than all the ruins in the world! Then turn to mark, in some reflective hour, The immortality of mortal pow'r! See the crush'd column, and the ruin'd dome— 'Tis all Eternity has left of Rome! While travell'd crowds, with curious gaze, repair, To read the littleness of greatness there! Alas! alas! so, Albion shall decay, And all my country's glory pass away! So shall she perish, as the mighty must, And be Italia's rival—in the dust; While her ennobled sons, her cities fair, Be dimly thought of 'midst the things that were! Alas! alas! her fields of pleasant green, Her woods of beauty, and each well-known scene! Soon, o'er her plains, shall grisly Ruin haste, And the gay vale become the silent waste! Ah! soon perchance, our native tongue forgot— The land may hear strange words it knoweth not; And the dear accents which our bosoms move, With sounds of friendship, or with tones of love, May pass away; or, conn'd on mould'ring page, Gleam 'neath the midnight lamp, for unborn sage; To tell our dream-like tale to future years, And wake th' historian's smile, and school-boy's tears! Majestic task! to join, though plac'd afar, The things that have been, with the things that are! Important trust! the awful dead, to scan, And teach mankind to moralize from man! Stupendous charge! when, on the record true, Depend the dead, and hang the living too! And, oh! thrice impious he, who dares abuse That solemn charge, and good and ill confuse! Thrice guilty he who, false with “words of sooth,” Would pay, to Prejudice, his debt to Truth; The hallow'd page of fleeting Time prophane, And prove to Man that man has liv'd in vain; Pass the cold grave, with colder jestings, by; And use the truth to illustrate a lie! Let Gibbon's name be trac'd, in sorrow, here,— Too great to spurn, too little to revere! Who follow'd Reason, yet forgot her laws, And found all causes, but the ‘great first Cause:’ The paths of time, with guideless footsteps, trod; Blind to the light of nature and of God; Deaf to the voice, amid the past's dread hour, Which sounds His praise, and chronicles His pow'r! In vain for him was Truth's fair tablet spread, When Prejudice, with jaundiced organs, read. In vain for us the polish'd periods flow, The fancy kindles, and the pages glow; When one bright hour, and startling transport past, The musing soul must turn—to sigh at last. Still let the page be luminous and just, Nor private feeling war with public trust; Still let the pen from narrowing views forbear, And modern faction ancient freedom spare. But, ah! too oft th' historian bends his mind To flatter party—not to serve mankind; To make the dead, in living feuds, engage, And give all time, the feelings of his age. Great Hume hath stoop'd, the Stuarts' fame, t' increase; And ultra Mitford soar'd to libel Greece! Mr. Mitford's acknowledged learning, and accuracy in detail, have a claim on our consideration, which we admit with readiness and pleasure; but prejudices, arising probably from early habits and associations, have deformed his work. He is evidently so afraid of taking the mob for the people, that he constantly takes the people for the mob—a perversion much in vogue among despots of Europe, in the nineteenth century. He considers the Athenian Democracy as he would a classical kind of Radicalism; and generously endows Philip of Macedon with a ‘right divine,’ not only over his own possessions, but over those of his neighbours. Mr. Mitford lets his readers look at facts: but, whether shortsighted as himself or not, he will not allow them to enjoy that privilege unless they make use of his political glasses; which, by the way, are No. 20, —“ne plus ultra!” Yet must the candid muse, impartial, learn To trace the errors which her eyes discern; View ev'ry side, investigate each part, And get the holy scroll of Truth by heart; No blame misplac'd, and yet no fault forgot— Like ink employ'd to write with—not to blot. Hence, while historians, just reproof, incur, We find some readers, with their authors, err; And soon discover, that as few excel In reading justly, as in writing well. For prejudice, or ignorance, is such, That men believe too little, or too much; Too apt to cavil, or too glad to trust, With confidence misplac'd, or blame unjust. Seek out no faction—no peculiar school— But lean on Reason, as your safest rule. We shall find some clever and animated observations on this subject, in Voltaire's preface to his Charles XII. I should extract them, but the book is too well known for me to doubt their having come to the knowledge of most readers: and a new publication is perhaps the only place, in which we are not glad to meet an old acquaintance. Let doubtful facts, with patient hand, be led, To take their place on this Procrustian bed! What, plainly, fits not, may be thrown aside, Without the censure of pedantic pride: For nature still, to just proportion, clings; And human reason judges natural things. Moreover, in th' historian's bosom look, And weigh his feelings ere you trust his book; His private friendships, private wrongs, descry, Where tend his passions, where his int'rests lie— And, while his proper faults your mind engage, Discern the ruling foibles of his age. Hence, when on deep research, the work you find A too obtrusive transcript of his mind; When you perceive a fact too highly wrought, Which kindly seems to prove a fav'rite thought; Or some opposing truth trac'd briefly out, With hand of careless speed—then turn to doubt! For private feeling, like the taper, glows, And here a light, and there a shadow, throws. If some gay picture, vilely daubed, were seen With grass of azure, and a sky of green, Th' impatient laughter we'd suppress in vain, And deem the painter jesting, or insane. But, when the sun of blinding prejudice Glares in our faces, it deceives our eyes; Truth appears falsehood to the dazzled sight, The comment apes the fact, and black seems white; Commingled hues, their separate colours lost, Dance wildly on, in bright confusion tost; And, midst their drunken whirl, the giddy eye Beholds one shapeless blot for earth and sky. Of such delusions let the mind take heed, And learn to think, or wisely cease to read; And, if a style of labour'd grace display Perverted feelings, in a pleasing way; False tints, on real objects, brightly laid, Facts in disguise, and Truth in masquerade— If cheating thoughts in beauteous dress appear, With magic sound, to captivate the ear— Th' enchanting poison of that page decline, Or drink Circean draughts—and turn to swine! We hail with British pride, and ready praise, Enlightened Miller of our modern days! Those who may think this praise excessive are referred to the Philosophy of Modern History, given to the world by Dr. Miller; and thence are requested to judge of the reality of the merit. Too firm though temp'rate, liberal though exact, To give too much to argument or fact, To love details, and draw no moral thence, Or seek the comment, and forget the sense, He leaves all vulgar aims, and strives alone To find the ways of Truth, and make them known! Spirit of life! for aye, with heav'nly breath, Warm the dull clay, and cold abodes of death! Clasp in its urn the consecrated dust, And bind a laurel round the broken bust; While mid decaying tombs, thy pensive choice, Thou bidst the silent utter forth a voice, To prompt the actors of our busy scene, And tell what is, the tale of what has been! Yet turn, Philosophy! with brow sublime, Shall Science follow on the steps of Time! As, o'er Thought's measureless depths, we bend to hear The whispered sound, which stole on Descartes' ear, “Descartes, when young, and in a country seclusion, his brain exhausted by meditation, and his imagination heated to excess, heard a voice in the air which called him to pursue the search of Truth: he never doubted the vision, and this dream, in the delirium of Genius, charmed him even in his after studies.” —D'Israeli's Literary Character. Hallowing the sunny visions of his youth With that eternal mandate, “Search for Truth!” Yes! search for Truth—the glorious path is free; Mind shews her dwelling—Nature holds the key— Yes! search for Truth—her tongue shall bid thee scan The book of knowledge, for the use of Man! Man! Man! thou poor antithesis of power! Child of all time! yet creature of an hour! By turns, camelion of a thousand forms, The lord of empires, and the food of worms! The little conqueror of a petty space, The more than mighty, or the worse than base! Thou ruin'd landmark, in the desert way, Betwixt the all of glory, and decay! Fair beams the torch of Science in thine hand, And sheds its brightness o'er the glimmering land; While, in thy native grandeur, bold, and free, Thou bid'st the wilds of nature smile for thee, And treadest Ocean's paths full royally! Earth yields her treasures up—celestial air Receives thy globe of life—when, journeying there, It bounds from dust, and bends its course on high, And walks, in beauty, through the wondering sky. And yet, proud clay! thine empire is a span, Nor all thy greatness makes thee more than man! While Knowledge, Science, only serve t' impart The god thou would'st be, and the thing thou art! Where stands the Syracusan—while the roar Of men, and engines, echoes through the shore? Where stands the Syracusan? haggard Fate, With ghastly smile, is sitting at the gate; And Death forgets his silence 'midst the crash Of rushing ruins—and the torches' flash Waves redly on the straggling forms that die; And masterless steeds, beneath that gleam, dart by, Scared into madness, by the battle cry— And sounds are hurtling in the angry air, Of hate, and pain, and vengeance, and despair— The smothered voice of babes—the long wild shriek Of mothers—and the curse the dying speak! Where stands the Syracusan? tranquil sage, He bends, sublime, o'er Science' splendid page; Walks the high circuit of extended mind, Surpasses man, and dreams not of mankind; While, on his listless ear, the battle shout Falls senseless—as if echo breath'd about The hum of many words, the laughing glee, Which linger'd there, when Syracuse was free. Away! away! for louder accents fall— But not the sounds of joy from marble hall! Quick steps approach—but not of sylphic feet, Whose echo heralded a smile more sweet, Coming, all sport, th'indulgent sage, t'upbraid For lonely hours, to studious musing, paid— Be hushed! Destruction bares the flickering blade! He asked to live, th' unfinished lines to fill, And died—to solve a problem deeper still. He died, the glorious! who, with soaring sight, Archimedes wrote to Hiero, that, if he had another world to stand on, he could move this by the power of his machinery. When Cicero stumbled on his grave, he found it, “Septum undique et vestitum vepribus et dumetis.” What a homily! Sought some new world, to plant his foot of might; Thereon, in solitary pride, to stand, And lift our planet, with a master's hand! He sank in death—Creation only gave That thorn-encumbered space which forms his grave— An unknown grave, till Tully chanced to stray, And named the spot where Archimedes lay! Genius! behold the limit of thy power! Thou fir'st the soul—but, when life's dream is o'er, Giv'st not the silent pulse one throb the more: And mighty beings come, and pass away, Like other comets, and like other—clay. Though analyzing Truth must still divide Historic state, and scientific pride; Yet one stale fact, our judging thoughts infer— Since each is human, each is prone to err! Oft, in the night of Time, doth History stray, And lift her lantern, and proclaim it day! And oft, when day's eternal glories shine, Doth Science, boasting, cry—“The light is mine!” So hard to bear, with unobstructed sight, Gray ingeniously asks, “Must I plunge into metaphysics?” (he might in some cases have said history)—“Alas! I cannot see in the dark; Nature has not furnished me with the optics of a cat. Must I pore upon mathematics? Alas! I cannot see in too much light; I am no eagle.” Th' excess of darkness, or th'extreme of light. Yet, to be just, though faults belong to each, The themes of one, an humbler moral, teach: And, 'midst th' historian's eloquence, and skill, The human chronicler is human still. If on past power, his eager thoughts be cast, It brings an awful antidote—'tis past! If, deathless fame, his ravish'd organs scan, The deathless fame exists for buried man: Power, and decay, at once he turns to view; And, with the strength, beholds the weakness too. Not so, doth Science' musing son aspire; And pierce creation, with his eye of fire. Yon mystic pilgrims of the starry way, No humbling lesson, to his soul, convey; No tale of change, their changeless course hath taught; And works divine excite no earthward thought. And still, he, reckless, builds the splendid dream; And still, his pride increases with his theme; And still, the cause is slighted in th' effect; And still, self-worship follows self-respect. Too apt to watch the engines of the scene, And lose the hand, which moves the vast machine; View Matter's form, and not its moving soul; Interpret parts, and misconceive the whole: While, darkly musing 'twixt the earth, and sky, His heart grows narrow, as his hopes grow high; And quits, for aye, with unavailing loss, The sympathies of earth, but not the dross; Till Time sweeps down the fabric of his trust; And life, and riches, turn to death, and dust. And such is Man! 'neath Error's foul assaults, His noblest moods beget his grossest faults! When Knowledge lifts her hues of varied grace, The fair exotic of a brighter place, To keep her stem, from mundane blasts, enshrin'd, He makes a fatal hot-bed of his mind; Too oft adapted, in their growth, to spoil The natural beauties of a generous soil. Ah! such is Man! thus strong, and weak withal, His rise oft renders him too prone to fall! The loftiest hills' fresh tints, the soonest, fade; And highest buildings cast the deepest shade! So Buffon err'd; amidst his chilling dream, Buffon was a materialist upon principle, though a Catholic by observance. Upon reading a poem on the immortality of the soul, he exclaimed—“Religion would be a noble present if this were true.” The judgment grew material as the theme: Musing on Matter, till he called away The modes of Mind, to form the modes of clay; And made, confusing each, with judgment blind, Mind stoop to dust, and dust ascend to Mind. So Leibnitz err'd; when, in the starry hour, He read no weakness, where was written, ‘Power;’ Beheld the verdant earth, the circling sea; Nor dreamt so fair a world could cease to be! Yea! but he heard the Briton's awful name, As, scattering darkness, in his might, he came, Girded with Truth, and earnest to confute What gave to Matter, Mind's best attribute. Sternly they strove—th' unequal race was run! Leibnitz attacked with violence Sir Isaac Newton's opinion, that the seeds of mortality would be developed in the fabric of the universe if unrenewed by its divine Maker. Such an opinion he considered ‘impious;’ and, in opposition to it, maintained, that as Creation proceeded from the hand of Perfection, it is perfect—and as perfect, immutable. The owlet met the eagle at the sun! While such defects, their various forms, unfold; And rust, so foul, obscures the brightest gold— Let Science' soaring sons, the ballast, cast, But judge their present errors, by their past. As some poor wanderer, in the darkness, goes, When fitful wind, in hollow murmur, blows; Hailing, with trembling joy, the lightning's ray, Which threats his safety, but illumes his way. Gross faults buy deep experience. Sages tell That Truth, like Æsop's fox, is in a well; And, like the goat, his fable prates about, Fools must stay in, that wise men may get out. What thousand scribblers, of our age, would choose To throw a toga round the English muse; Rending her garb of ease, which graceful grew From Dryden's loom, beprankt with varied hue! In that dull aim, by Mind unsanctified, What thousand Wits would have their wits belied, Devoted Southey! if thou had'st not tried! Few are ready to bear a more respectful tribute to Dr. Southey's poetical talents than the writer of this Work, who however begs to be allowed to admire his genius, without extending that admiration either to his politics or Hexameters. Use is the aim of Science; this the end The wise appreciate, and the good commend. For not, like babes, the flaming torch, we prize, That sparkling lustre may attract our eyes; But that, when evening shades impede the sight, It casts, on objects round, a useful light. Use is the aim of Science! give again A golden sentence to the faithful pen— Dwell not on parts! for parts contract the mind; Lord Bacon thus expresses himself— “Sciences distinguished have a dependance upon universal knowledge, to be augmented, and rectified by the superior light thereof; as well as the parts and members of a science have upon the maxims of the same science, and the mutual light and consent which one part receiveth of another.” —Interpretatio Naturæ. And knowledge still is useless, when confined. The yearning soul, inclosed in narrow bound, May be ingenious, but is ne'er profound: Spoil'd of its strength, the fettered thought grows tame; And want of air extinguishes the flame! And as the sun, beheld in mid-day blaze, Seems turned to darkness, as we strive to gaze; So mental vigour, on one object, cast, That object's self becomes obscured at last. 'Tis easy, as Experience may aver, To pass from general to particular. But most laborious to direct the soul From studying parts, to reason on the whole: Thoughts, train'd on narrow subjects, to let fall; And learn the unison of each with all. In Nature's reign, a scale of life, we find: A scale of knowledge, we behold, in mind; With each progressive link, our steps ascend, And traverse all, before they reach the end; Searching, while Reason's powers may farther go, The things we know not, by the things we know. But hold! methinks some sons of Thought demand, “Why strive to form the Trajan's vase in sand? Are Reason's paths so few, that Mind may call Her finite energies, to tread them all? Lo! Learning's waves, in bounded channel, sweep; When they flow wider, shall they run as deep? Shall that broad surface, no dull shallow, hide, Growing dank weeds of superficial pride? Then Heaven may leave our giant powers alone; Nor give each soul a focus of its own! Genius bestows, in vain, the chosen page, If all the tome, the minds of all, engage!” Nay! I reply—with free congenial breast, Let each peruse the part, which suits him best! But, lest contracting prejudice mislead, Regard the context, as he turns to read! Hence, liberal feeling gives th'enlighten'd soul, The spirit, with the letter of the scroll. With what triumphant joy, what glad surprise, The dull behold the dulness of the wise! What insect tribes of brainless impudence Buzz round the carcase of perverted sense! What railing ideots hunt, from classic school, Each flimsy sage, and scientific fool, Crying, “'Tis well! we see the blest effect Of watchful night, and toiling intellect!” Yet let them pause, and tremble—vainly glad; For too much learning maketh no man mad! Perhaps, after all, the great danger of knowing is in not knowing enough; and certainly “il pie fermo” is not “il piu basso.” “It is true,” says Lord Bacon, “that a little philosophy inclineth men's minds to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth their minds about to religion.” This is an acute observation, and if generalized will be found equally so. The errors attending Intellectual Elevation I have alluded to and allowed; but that elevation is only comparative. “Alps on Alps arise!” and the ars longa vita brevis prevents our attaining the topmost height. In our progress towards it then is our risk—lest we rejoice to have gone a yard, without remembering we have a mile to go. Like the princess, in the pretty Arabian tale, who was ascending the mountain in search of her talking bird and golden water, if during the ascent we turn back to gaze, we are transformed into black stones—capable of impeding others, though not of advancing ourselves. Too little dims the sight, and leads us o'er The twilight path, where fools have been before; With not enough of Reason's radiance seen, To track the footsteps, where those fools have been. Divinest Newton! if my pen may shew A name so mighty, in a verse so low,— Still let the sons of Science, joyful, claim The bright example of that splendid name! Still let their lips repeat, my page bespeak, The sage how learned! and the man how meek! The character of Sir Isaac Newton forms a sublime comment on the foregoing note. “I don't know,” said that greatest and humblest of men, “what I may seem to the world; but as to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble, or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of Truth lay all undiscovered before me.”—We find the anecdote in Spence. Too wise, to think his human folly less; Too great, to doubt his proper littleness; Too strong, to deem his weakness past away; Too high in soul, to glory in his clay: Rich in all nature, but her erring side: Endow'd with all of Science—but its pride. BOOK II. ANALYSIS OF THE SECOND BOOK. Metaphysics—Address to Metaphysicians —The most considerable portion of their errors conceived to arise from difficulties attending the use of words—That on one hand, thoughts become obscure without the assistance of language, while on the other, language from its material analogy deteriorates from spiritual meaning—Allusion to a probable mode of communication between spirits after death—That a limited respect, though not a servile submission, is due to verbal distinctions—Clearness of style peculiarly necessary to Metaphysical subjects— The graces of Composition not inconsistent with them—Plato, Bacon, Bolingbroke—The extremes into which Philosophers have fallen with regard to sensation, and reflection— Berkeley, Condillac—That subject briefly considered —Abstractions—Longinus, Burke, Price, Payne Knight—Blind submission to authorities deprecated—The Pythagorean saying opposed, and Cicero's unphilosophical assertion alluded to—That, however, it partakes of injustice to love Truth, and yet refuse our homage to the advocates of Truth— How the names of great writers become endeared to us by early recollections—Description of the School-boy's first intellectual gratifications—That even without reference to the past, some immortal names are entitled to our veneration, since they are connected with Truth—Bacon—Apostrophe to Locke.

But now to higher themes! no more confin'd To copy Nature, Mind returns to Mind. We leave the throng, so nobly, and so well, Tracing, in Wisdom's book, things visible,— And turn to things unseen; where, greatly wrought, Soul questions soul, and thought revolves on thought. My spirit loves, my voice shall hail ye, now, Sons of the patient eye, and passionless brow! Students sublime! Earth, man, unmov'd, ye view, Time, circumstance; for what are they to you? What is the crash of worlds,—the fall of kings,— When worlds and monarchs are such brittle things! What the tost, shatter'd bark, that blindly dares A sea of storm? Ye sketch the wave which bears! The cause, and not th' effect, your thoughts exact; The principle of action, not the act,— The soul! the soul! and, 'midst so grand a task, Ye call her rushing passions, and ye ask Whence are ye? and each mystic thing responds! I would be all ye are—except those bonds! Except those bonds! ev'n here is oft descried The love to parts, the poverty of pride! Ev'n here, while Mind, in Mind's horizon, springs, Her “native mud” is weighing on her wings! Ev'n here, while Truth invites the ardent crowd, Ixion-like, they rush t' embrace a cloud! Ev'n here, oh! foul reproach to human wit! A Hobbes hath reasoned, and Spinosa writ! Rank pride does much! and yet we justly cry, Our greatest errors in our weakness lie. For thoughts uncloth'd by language are, at best, Obscure; while grossness injures those exprest— Through words,—in whose analysis, we find Th' analogies of Matter, not of Mind: Hence, when the use of words is graceful brought, As physical dress to metaphysic thought, The thought, howe'er sublime its pristine state, Is by th' expression made degenerate; Its spiritual essence changed, or cramp'd; and hence Some hold by words, who cannot hold by sense; And leave the thought behind, and take th' attire— Elijah's mantle—but without his fire! Yet spurn not words! 'tis needful to confess They give ideas, a body and a dress! Behold them traverse Learning's region round, The vehicles of thought on wheels of sound; Mind's winged strength, wherewith the height is won, Unless she trust their frailty to the sun. Destroy the body!—will the spirit stay? Destroy the car!—will Thought pursue her way? Destroy the wings!—let Mind their aid forego! Do no Icarian billows yawn below? Ah! spurn not words with reckless insolence; But still admit their influence with the sense, And fear to slight their laws! Perchance we find No perfect code transmitted to mankind; And yet mankind, till life's dark sands are run, Prefers imperfect government to none. Thus Thought must bend to words!—Some sphere of bliss, Ere long, shall free her from th' alloy of this: Some kindred home for Mind—some holy place, Where spirits look on spirits, “face to face,”— Where souls may see, as they themselves are seen, And voiceless intercourse may pass between, All pure—all free! as light, which doth appear In its own essence, incorrupt and clear! One service, praise! one age, eternal youth! One tongue, intelligence! one subject, truth! Till then, no freedom, Learning's search affords, Of soul from body, or of thought from words. For thought may lose, in struggling to be hence, The gravitating power of Common-sense; Through all the depths of space with Phaeton hurl'd, T' impair our reason, as he scorch'd our world. Hence, this preceptive truth, my page affirms— Respect the technicality of terms! Yet not in base submission—lest we find That, aiding clay, we crouch too low for Mind; Too apt conception's essence to forget, And place all wisdom in the alphabet. Still let appropriate phrase the sense invest; That what is well conceived be well exprest! Nor e'er the reader's wearied brain engage, In hunting meaning down the mazy page, With three long periods tortured into one, The sentence ended, with the sense begun; Nor in details, which schoolboys know by heart, Perplex each turning with the terms of art. To understand, we deem no common good; And 'tis less easy to be understood. But let not clearness be your only praise, When style may charm a thousand different ways; In Plato glow, to life and glory wrought, By high companionship with noblest thought; In Bacon, warm abstraction with a breath, Catch Poesy's bright beams, and smile beneath; In St. John roll, a generous stream, along, Correctly free, and regularly strong. Nor scornful deem the effort out of place, With taste to reason, and convince with grace; But ponder wisely, ere you know, too late, Contempt of trifles will not prove us great! The Cynics, not their tubs, respect engage; And dirty tunic never made a sage. E'en Cato—had he own'd the Senate's will, And wash'd his toga—had been Cato still. Plutarch relates that Cato Uticensis was thought to disgrace the Prætorship by the meanness of his dress. To couple ‘disgrace’ with the name of Cato revolts the soul; and yet who would call his “exigua toga” a proof of the loftiness of his virtue, or think him less a patriot if he had kept on his shoes? Justly we censure—yet are free to own, That indecision is a crime unknown. For, never faltering, seldom reasoning long, And still most positive whene'er most wrong, No theoretic sage is apt to fare Like Mah'met's coffin—hung in middle air! No! fenc'd by Error's all-sufficient trust, These stalk “in nubibus”—those crawl in dust. From their proud height, the first demand to know, If spiritual essence should descend more low? The last, as vainly, from their dunghill, cry, Can body's grossness hope t'aspire more high? And while Reflection's empire, these disclose, Sensation's sovereign right is told by those. Lo! Berkeley proves an old hypothesis! ‘Out on the senses!’ (he was out of his!) ‘All is idea! and nothing real springs But God, and Reason’—(not the right of kings?) An obvious question. Pyrrho the Elean, founder of the Ideal Philosophy, on the near approach of carts and carriages, did not think it worth while to turn aside, or change his posture. Dr. Berkeley, with less consistency, but more prudence, found time (and conscience) to write three sermons in vindication of passive obedience. ‘Hold!’ says Condillac with profound surprise— ‘Why prate of Reason? we have ears and eyes!’ Condillac! while the dangerous periods fall Upon thy page, to stamp sensation all; While (coldly studious!) thine ingenious scroll It is the object of Condillac's work, ‘Sur la Sensation,’ to prove ‘que la reflexion n'est dans son principe que la sensation même,’ and that our ideas are only sensation transformed. His statue is very cleverly put together, but is a statue after all. Endows the mimic statue with a soul Compos'd of sense—behold the generous hound— His piercing eye, his ear awake to sound, His scent, most delicate organ! and declare What triumph hath the “Art of thinking” there! “L'Art de penser”—title to one of Condillac's works. What Gall, or Spurzheim, on his front hath sought The mystic bumps indicative of Thought? Or why, if Thought do there maintain her throne, Will reasoning curs leave logic for a bone? Mind is imprison'd in a lonesome tower: Sensation is its window—hence herb, flower, Landscapes all sun, the rush of thousand springs, Waft in sweet scents, fair sights, soft murmurings; And in her joy, she gazeth—yet ere long, Reason awaketh in her, bold and strong, And o'er the scene exerting secret laws, First seeks th' efficient, then the final cause, Abstracts from forms their hidden accidents, And marks in outward substance, inward sense. Our first perceptions formed—we search, to find The operations of the forming mind; And turn within by Reason's certain route, To view the shadows of the things without Discern'd, retain'd, compar'd, combin'd, and brought To mere abstraction, by abstracting Thought. Hence to discern, retain, compare, connect, We deem the faculties of Intellect; The which, mus'd on, exert a new controul, And fresh ideas are open'd on the soul. Sensation is a stream with dashing spray, That shoots in idle speed its arrowy way; When lo! the mill arrests its waters' course, Turning to use their unproductive force: The cunning wheels by foamy currents sped, Reflection triumphs,—and mankind is fed! Since Pope hath shewn, and Learning still must shew, ‘We cannot reason but from what we know,’— Unfold the scroll of Thought; and turn to find The undeceiving signature of Mind! There, judge her nature by her nature's course, And trace her actions upwards to their source. So when the property of Mind we call An essence, or a substance spiritual, We name her thus, by marking how she clings Less to the forms than essences of things; For body clings to body—objects seen And substance sensible alone have been Sensation's study; while reflective Mind, Essence unseen in objects seen may find; And, tracing whence her known impressions came, Give single forms an universal name. So, when particular sounds in concord rise, Those sounds as melody, we generalize; When pleasing shapes and colours blend, the soul Abstracts th' idea of beauty from the whole, Deducting thus, by Mind's enchanting spell, The intellectual from the sensible. Hence bold Longinus' splendid periods grew, ‘Who was himself the great sublime he drew:’ Hence Burke, the poet-reasoner, learn'd to trace His glowing style of energetic grace: Hence thoughts, perchance, some favour'd bosoms move, Which Price might own, and classic Knight approve! Go! light a rushlight, ere the day is done, And call its glimm'ring brighter than the sun! Go! while the stars in midnight glory beam, Prefer their cold reflection in the stream! But be not that dull slave, who only looks On Reason, “through the spectacles of books!” Rather by Truth determine what is true,— And reasoning works, through Reason's medium, view; For authors can't monopolize her light: 'Tis your's to read, as well as their's to write. To judge is your's!—then why submissive call, An ‘argumentum ad verecundiam’ used by the Pythagoreans. I so much admire a passage in Plato's Phædo, illustrative of these lines, that the reader must forgive my referring to it. Cebes supports with animation an opinion in opposition to Socrates, who, turning a gratified countenance (“??????? ?? ??? ?????,” says the narrator) to his other disciples, benignly observes—‘Cebes always looks into principles; neither will he admit, without examination, the sentiments of any man.’ We find in Dr. Reid the following striking precept—“Let us, as becomes philosophers, lay aside authority.” ‘The master said so?’—'tis no rule at all! Shall passive sufferance e'en to mind belong, When right divine in man is human wrong? Shall a high name a low idea enhance, When all may fail, as some succeed—by chance? Shall fix'd chimeras unfix'd reason shock? And if Locke err, must thousands err with Locke? Men! claim your charter! spurn th' unjust controul, And shake the bondage from the free-born soul! Go walk the porticoes! and teach your youth All names are bubbles, but the name of Truth! If fools, by chance, attend to Wisdom's rules, 'Tis no dishonour to be right with fools. If human faults to Plato's page belong, Cicero's assertion, “errare mehercule malo cum Platone quam cum istis vera sentire,” is more boldly said than singularly thought. How many are there, among the canaille of readers, prepared to praise an inferior volume, with the Waverley magic on its title-page; to commend a common-place by Rogers, or a far-fetched allusion by Moore. Even among the more critical of us, have the names of Scott, and Moore, and Rogers, no secret influence? Do we not so devoutly admire the noisy slippered Venus, that at length we begin to reverence, abstractedly, the noisy slippers? This is so, and I will not quarrel with it; since to forget the trifling faults of a great writer, is the gratitude we owe to his perfections. But what, in subjects of taste and sentiment, may be tolerated as pardonable enthusiasm, must in grave discussion, be condemned as unpardonable weakness. If therefore we judge Cicero only by the above-cited passage, we shall pronounce him to be a good Platonist, (in one sense of the word) but a very bad philosopher. It is not with him, ‘Amicus Plato sed magis amica veritas:’ he loves truth less than he loves Plato. Not ev'n with Plato, willingly go wrong. But though the judging page declare it well To love Truth better than the lips which tell; Yet 'twere an error, with injustice class'd, T' adore the former, and neglect the last. Oh! beats there, Heav'n! a heart of human frame, Whose pulses throb not at some kindling name? Some sound, which brings high musings in its track, Or calls perchance the days of childhood back, In its dear echo,—when, without a sigh, Swift hoop, and bounding ball, were first laid by, To clasp in joy, from school-room tyrant, free, The classic volume on the little knee, And con sweet sounds of dearest minstrelsy, Or words of sterner lore; the young brow fraught With a calm brightness which might mimic thought, Leant on the boyish hand—as, all the while, A half-heav'd sigh, or aye th' unconscious smile Would tell how, o'er that page, the soul was glowing, In an internal transport, past the knowing! How feelings, erst unfelt, did then appear, Give forth a voice, and murmur, “We are here!” As lute-strings, which a strong hand plays upon; Or Memnon's statue singing 'neath the sun. The statue of Memnon, the Ethiopian king, was said to utter musical sounds at the rising of the sun. Strabo witnessed this singular phenomenon, but could only explain it by conjecture. Ah me! for such are pleasant memories— And call the tears of fondness to our eyes Reposing on this gone-by dream—when thus, One marbled book was all the world to us; The gentlest bliss our innocent thoughts could find— The happiest cradle of our infant mind! And though such hours be past, we shall not less Think on their joy with grateful tenderness; And bless the page which bade our reason wake,— And love the prophet, for his mission's sake. But not alone doth Memory's smouldering flame Reflect a radiance on a glorious name; For there are names of pride; and they who bear Have walked with Truth, and turn'd their footsteps where We walk not—their beholdings aye have been O'er Mind's far countries which we have not seen— Our thoughts are not their thoughts!—and oft we dream That light upon the awful brow doth gleam, From that high converse; as when Moses trod Towards the people, from the mount of God, His lips were silent, but his face was bright, And prostrate Israel trembled at the sight. What tongue can syllable our Bacon's name, Nor own a heart exulting in his fame? Where prejudice' wild blasts were wont to blow, And waves of ignorance roll'd dark below, He raised his sail—and left the coast behind,— Sublime Columbus of the realms of Mind! Dared folly's mists, opinion's treacherous sands, And walk'd, with godlike step, th' untrodden lands! But ah! our Muse of Britain, standing near, It is a practice too common, but manifestly unjust, to visit on the memory of distinguished authors their individual failings. I wish therefore to state expressly, that the Muse of Britain is not here supposed to animadvert on Lord Bacon's character as a statesman, with which she has nothing to do in this place. It is with regard to his writings that I cannot avoid expressing a regret, and I do so reverentially, that pages so glorious should be polluted by passages so servile. “As men, we share his fame”—as Englishmen, we feel his degradation. If indeed the ‘Novum organum,’ and ‘Advancement of Learning,’ kindled our souls into a less proud consciousness of intellectual dignity, we might better brook hearing a king called ‘a mortal god upon earth,’ and James the First compared to Solomon. But Lord Bacon first teaches us how high Philosophy can soar, and then how low a philosopher can stoop. Hath dimm'd my tablet with a pensive tear! Thrice, the proud theme, her free-born voice essays,— And thrice that voice is faltering in his praise— Yea! till her eyes in silent triumph turn To mark afar her Locke's sepulchral urn! Oh urn! where students rapturous vigils keep, Where sages envy, and where patriots weep! Oh Name! that bids my glowing spirit wake— To freemen's hearts endeared for Freedom's sake! Oh soul! too bright in life's corrupting hour, To rise by faction, or to crouch to power! While radiant Genius lifts her heav'nward wing, And human bosoms own the Mind I sing; While British writers British thoughts record, And England's press is fearless as her sword; While, 'mid the seas which gird our favor'd isle, She clasps her charter'd rights with conscious smile; So long be thou her glory, and her guide, Thy page her study, and thy name her pride! Oh! ever thus, immortal Locke, belong First to my heart, as noblest in my song; And since in thee, the muse enraptured find A moral greatness, and creating mind, Still may thine influence, which with honor'd light Beams when I read, illume me as I write! The page too guiltless, and the soul too free, To call a frown from Truth, or blush from thee! But where Philosophy would fear to soar, Young Poesy's elastic steps explore! Her fairy foot, her daring eye pursues The light of faith—nor trembles as she views! Wont o'er the Psalmist's holy harp to hang, And swell the sacred note when Milton sang; Mingling reflection's chords with fancy's lays, The tones of music with the voice of praise! And while Philosophy, in spirit, free, Reasons, believes, yet cannot plainly see, Poetic Rapture, to her dazzled sight, Pourtrays the shadows of the things of light; Delighting o'er the unseen worlds to roam, And waft the pictures of perfection home. Thus Reason oft the aid of fancy seeks, And strikes Pierian chords—when Irving speaks! There is a pleasure in being benefitted by the labours of Genius: there is a pride in possessing powers capable of benefitting. The pride Mr. Irving may justly feel; and which of his readers, or hearers, cannot boast the pleasure? It gratifies me to be enabled to express in this place my admiration of his talents, and my respect for their direction. Oh! silent be the withering tongue of those Who call each page, bereft of measure, prose; Who deem the Muse possest of such faint spells, That like poor fools, she glories in her bells; Who hear her voice alone in tinkling chime, And find a line's whole magic in its rhyme; Forgetting, if the gilded shrine be fair, What purer spirit may inhabit there! For such,—indignant at her questioned might, Let Genius cease to charm—and Scott to write! Ungrateful Plato! o'er thy cradled rest, Plato wrote poetry in his youth; and when indeed did not Plato write poetry? Longinus numbers him among the imitators of Homer— ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ? ?????? ??? ??? ???????? ??????? ??????? ??? ????? ?????? ???? ?????????? ???????????????. The Muse hath hung, and all her love exprest; Thy first imperfect accents fondly taught, And warm'd thy visions with poetic thought! Ungrateful Plato! should her deadliest foe Be found within the breast she tended so? Spoil'd of her laurels, should she weep to find The best belov'd become the most unkind? And was it well or generous, Brutus like, To pierce the hand that gave the power to strike? Sages, by reason, reason's powers direct; Bards, through the heart, convince the intellect. Philosophy majestic brings to view Mind's perfect modes, and fair proportions too; Enchanting Poesy bestows the while, Upon its sculptured grace, her magic smile, Bids the cold form, with living radiance glow, And stamps existence on its marble brow! For Poesy's whole essence, when defined, Is elevation of the reasoning mind, When inward sense from Fancy's page is taught, And moral feeling ministers to Thought. And hence, the natural passions all agree In seeking Nature's language—poetry. When Hope, in soft perspective, from afar, Sees lovely scenes more lovely than they are; To deck the landscape, tiptoe Fancy brings Her plastic shapes, and bright imaginings. Or when man's breast by torturing pangs is stung, If fearful silence cease t' enchain his tongue, In metaphor, the feelings seek relief, And all the soul grows eloquent with grief. Poetic fire, like Vesta's, pure and bright, Should draw from Nature's sun, its holy light. With Nature, should the musing poet roam, And steal instruction from her classic tome; When 'neath her guidance, least inclin'd to err— The ablest painter when he copies her. Beloved Shakespeare! England's dearest fame! Dead is the breast that swells not at thy name! Whether thine Ariel skim the seas along, Floating on wings etherial as his song— Lear rave amid the tempest—or Macbeth Question the hags of hell on midnight heath— Immortal Shakespeare! still, thy lips impart The noblest comment on the human heart. And as fair Eve, in Eden newly placed, The reader will here perceive an allusion to that beautiful passage in Paradise Lost, book the fourth, where Eve describes to Adam her emotions on first beholding her own reflection in “the clear smooth lake”—“A shape within the watery gleam appeared, Bending to look on me—I started back— It started back,” &amp;c. Gazed on her form, in limpid waters traced, And stretch'd her gentle arms, with pleased surprise, To meet the image of her own bright eyes— So Nature, on thy magic page, surveys Her sportive graces, and untutored ways! Wondering, the soft reflection doth she see, Then laughing owns she loves herself in thee! Shun not the haunts of crowded cities then; Nor e'er, as man, forget to study men! What though the tumult of the town intrude On the deep silence, and the lofty mood; 'Twill make thy human sympathies rejoice, To hear the music of a human voice— To watch strange brows by various reason wrought, To claim the interchange of thought with thought; T' associate mind with mind, for Mind's own weal, As steel is ever sharpen'd best by steel. T' impassion'd bards, the scenic world is dear,— But Nature's glorious masterpiece is here! All poetry is beauty, but exprest In inward essence, not in outward vest. Hence lovely scenes, reflective poets find, Awake their lovelier images in Mind: Nor doth the pictur'd earth, the bard invite, The lake of azure, or the heav'n of light, But that his swelling breast arouses there, Something less visible, and much more fair! There is a music in the landscape round,— A silent voice, that speaks without a sound— A witching spirit, that reposing near, Breathes to the heart, but comes not to the ear! These softly steal, his kindling soul t' embrace, And natural beauty, gild with moral grace. Think not, when summer breezes tell their tale, The poet's thoughts are with the summer gale; Think not his Fancy builds her elfin dream On painted floweret, or on sighing stream: No single objects cause his raptured starts, For Mind is narrow'd, not inspir'd by parts; But o'er the scene the poet's spirit broods, To warm the thoughts that form his noblest moods; Peopling his solitude with faëry play, And beckoning shapes that whisper him away,— While lilied fields, and hedge-row blossoms white, And hills, and glittering streams, are full in sight— The forests wave, the joyous sun beguiles, And all the poetry of Nature smiles! Such poetry is formed by Mind, and not By scenic grace of one peculiar spot. The artist lingers in the moon-lit glade, “Quam multa vident Pictores in umbris et eminentia quæ nos non videmus,” is the motto to Mr. Price's admirable essay on the Picturesque. Dugald Stewart proposes its reversion —“Quam multa videmus nos quæ Pictores non vident,” which if it be as true as ingenious, will go a great way in assisting my position. And light and shade, with him, are—light and shade. The philosophic chymist wandering there, Dreams of the soil, and nature of the air. The rustic marks the young herbs' fresh'ning hue, And only thinks—his scythe may soon pass through! None “muse on nature with a Poet's eye,” None read, but Poets, Nature's poetry! Its characters are trac'd in mystic hand, And all may gaze, but few can understand. Nor here alone the Poet's dwelling rear, Though Beauty's voice perchance is sweetest here! Bind not his footsteps to the sylvan scene, To heathy banks, fair woods, and valleys green, When Mind is all his own! her dear impress Shall throw a magic o'er the wilderness, As o'er the blossoming vale, and aye recall Its shadowy plane, and silver waterfall, Or sleepy crystal pool, reposing by, To give the earth a picture of the sky! Such, gazed on by the spirit, are, I ween, Lovelier than ever prototype was seen; For Fancy teacheth Memory's hand to trace Lord Bacon says of Poetry, that “it was ever thought to have some participation of divineness, because it doth raise and erect the mind, by submitting the shews of things to the desires of the mind; whereas Reason doth buckle and bow the mind unto the nature of things.” —Advancement of Learning, Book 2. Nature's ideal form in Nature's place. In every theme by lofty Poet sung, The thought should seem to speak, and not the tongue. When godlike Milton lifts th' exalted song, The subject bears the burning words along— Resounds the march of Thought, th' o'erflowing line, Full cadence, solemn pause, and strength divine! When Horace chats his neighbour's faults away, The sportive measures, like his muse, are gay; For once Good-humour Satire's by-way took, And all his soul is laughing in his book! On moral Pope's didactic page is found, Sound rul'd by sense, and sense made clear by sound; The power to reason, and the taste to please, While, as the subject varies in degrees, He stoops with dignity, and soars with ease. Hence let our Poets, with discerning glance, Forbear to imitate the stage of France. What though Corneille arouse the thrilling chords, And walk with Genius o'er th'inspirëd boards; What though his rival bring, with calmer grace, The classic unities of time and place,— All polish, and all eloquence—'twere mean To leave the path of Nature for Racine; When Nero's parent, 'midst her woe, defines The wrong that tortures—in two hundred lines: Or when Orestes, madden'd by his crime, Forgets life, joy, and every thing—but rhyme. While thus to character and nature, true, Still keep the harmony of verse in view; Yet not in changeless concord,—it should be Though graceful, nervous,—musical, though free; Not clogg'd by useless drapery, not beset By the superfluous word, or epithet, Wherein Conception only dies in state, The Athenian People being accustomed to testify their approbation by the casting of their garments on the approved individual, Draco was honourably smothered through excess of popularity. As Draco, smother'd by the garments' weight— But join, Amphion-like, (whose magic fire Won the deep music of the Maian lyre, To call Bœotia's city from the ground,) The just in structure, with the sweet in sound. Nor this the whole—the poet's classic strain May flow in smoothest numbers, yet in vain; And Taste may please, and Fancy sport awhile, And yet Aonia's muse refuse to smile! For lo! her heavenly lips these words reveal— ‘The sage may coldly think, the bard must feel! And if his writings, to his heart untrue, Would ape the fervent throb it never knew; If generous deeds, and Virtue's noblest part, And Freedom's voice, could never warm that heart; If Interest tax'd the produce of the brain, And fetter'd Genius follow'd in her train, Weeping as each unwilling word she spoke,— Then hush the lute—its master string is broke! In vain, the skilful hand may linger o'er— Concord is dead, and music speaks no more!’ There are, and have been such—they were forgot If shame could veil their page, if tears could blot! There are, and have been, whose dishonour'd lay Aspired t' enrapture that the world might—pay! Whose life was one long bribe, oft counted o'er,— Brib'd to think on, and brib'd to think no more; Brib'd to laugh, weep, nor ask the reason why; Brib'd to tell truth, and brib'd to gild a lie! Oh Man! for this, the sensual left behind, We boast our empire o'er the vast of Mind? Oh Mind! reported valueless, till sold, Thought dross till metamorphos'd into gold By Midas' touch—breath'st thou immortal verse To throw a ducat in an empty purse— To walk the market at a belman's cry, For knaves to sell, and wond'ring fools to buy? Can Heav'n-born bards, undone by lucre's lust, Crouch thus, like Heav'n-born ministers, to dust? Alas! to dust indeed—yet wherefore blame? They keep their profits, though they lose their fame. Leave to the dross they seek, the grovelling throng, And swell with nobler aim th' Aonian song! Enough for thee uninfluenc'd and unhir'd, If Truth reward the strain herself inspir'd! Enough for thee, if grateful Man commend, If Genius love, and Virtue call thee friend! Enough for thee, to wake th' exalted mood, Reprove the erring, and confirm the good; Excite the tender smile, the generous tear, Or rouse the thought to loftiest Nature dear, Which rapturous greets amidst the fervent line, Thy name, O Freedom! glorious Hellas, thine! I love my own dear land—it doth rejoice The soul, to stretch my arms, and lift my voice, To tell her of my love! I love her green And bowery woods, her hills in mossy sheen, Her silver running waters—there's no spot In all her dwelling, which my breast loves not— No place not heart-enchanted! Sunnier skies, And calmer waves, may meet another's eyes; I love the sullen mist, the stormy sea, The winds of rushing strength which, like the land, are free! Such is my love—yet turning thus to thee, Oh Græcia! I must hail with hardly less Of joy, and pride, and deepening tenderness, And feelings wild, I know not to controul, My other country—country of my soul! For so, to me, thou art! my lips have sung Of thee with childhood's lisp, and harp unstrung! In thee, my Fancy's pleasant walks have been, Telling her tales, while Memory wept between! And now for thee I joy, with heart beguiled, As if a dying friend looked up, and smiled. Lo! o'er Ægæa's waves, the shout hath ris'n! Lo! Hope hath burst the fetters of her prison! And Glory sounds the trump along the shore, And Freedom walks where Freedom walk'd before! Ipsara glimmers with heroic light, Redd'ning the waves that lash her flaming height; And Ægypt hurries from that dark blue sea! Lo! o'er the cliffs of fam'd Thermopylæ, And voiceful Marathon, the wild winds sweep, Bearing this message to the brave who sleep— ‘They come! they come! with their embattled shock, From Pelion's steep, and Paros' foam-dash'd rock! They come from Tempe's vale, and Helicon's spring, And proud Eurotas' banks, the river king! They come from Leuctra, from the waves that kiss Athena—from the shores of Salamis; From Sparta, Thebes, Eubœa's hills of blue— To live with Hellas—or to sleep with you!’ Smile—smile, beloved land! and though no lay From Doric pipe, may charm thy glades today— Though dear Ionic music murmur not Adown the vale—its echo all forgot! Yet smile, beloved land! for soon, around, Thy silent earth shall utter forth a sound, As whilom—and, its pleasant groves among, The Grecian voice shall breathe the Grecian song, While the exilëd muse shall 'habit still The happy haunts of her Parnassian hill. Till then, behold the cold dumb sepulchre— The ruin'd column—ocean, earth, and air, Man, and his wrongs—thou hast Tyrtæus there! The inspiriting effect of the productions of this Greek Poet, during the war between the Lacedæmonians and Messenians, is well known. And pardon, if across the heaving main, Sound the far melody of minstrel strain, In wild and fitful gust from England's shore, For his immortal sake, who never more Shall tread with living foot, and spirit free, Her fields, or breathe her passionate poetry— The pilgrim bard, who lived, and died for thee, Oh land of Memory! loving thee no less Than parent—with the filial tenderness, And holy ardour of the Argive son, Straining each nerve to bear thy chariot on— Till when its wheels the place of glory swept, He laid him down before the shrine—and slept. Herodotus relates of Cleobis and Bito, Argive brothers, that on a festival of Juno they themselves, in default of oxen, drew the chariot of the priestess, their mother, forty-five stadia to the temple. Amidst the shouts of an admiring multitude, their grateful parent asked of the gods the best boon mortals could receive, wherewith to reward the piety of her sons. The young men fell asleep within the temple, and woke no more. So be it! at his cold unconscious bier, We fondly sate, and dropp'd the natural tear— Yet wept not wisely, for he sank to rest On the dear earth his waking thoughts loved best, And gently life's last pulses stole away! No Moschus sang a requiem o'er his clay, That exquisite effusion of Moschus over the grave of Bion, his “vatis amici”—his brother in poetry and love—will occur to the reader's recollection. But Greece was sad! and breathed above, below, The warrior's sigh, the silence, and the woe! And is this all? Is this the little sum For which we toil—to which our glories come? Doth History bend her mouldering pages o'er, And Science stretch her bulwark from the shore, And Sages search the mystic paths of Thought, And Poets charm with lays that Genius taught— For this? to labour through their little day, To weep an hour, then want the tear they pay— To ask the urn, their death and life to tell, When the dull dust would give that tale as well! Man! hast thou seen the gallant vessel sweep, Borrowing her moonlight from the jealous deep, And gliding with mute foot, and silver wing, Over the waters like a soul-mov'd thing? Man, hast thou gazed on this—then look'd again, And seen no speck on all that desolate main, And heard no sound,—except the gurgling cry, The winds half stifled in their mockery? Woe unto thee! for, thus, thy course is run, And, in the fulness of thy noon-day sun, The darkness cometh—yea! thou walk'st abroad In glory, Child of Mind, Creation's Lord— And wisdom's music from thy lips hath gush'd! Then comes the Selah! and the voice is hush'd, Respecting this Hebrew word, which is found “seventy times in the Psalms, and three times in Habakkuk,” Calmet observes—“One conjecture is, that it means the end or a pause, and that the ancient musicians put it occasionally in the margin of their psalters, to shew where a musical pause was to be made, and where the tune ended.” And the light past! we seek where thou hast been In beauty—but thy beauty is not seen! We breathe the air thou breath'dst, we tread the spot Thy feet were wont to tread, but find thee not! Beyond, sits Darkness with her haggard face, Brooding fiend-like above thy burying-place— Beneath, let wildest Fancy take her fill! Shall we seek on? we shudder, and are still! Yet woe not unto thee, thou child of Earth! Though moonlight sleep on thy deserted hearth, We will not cry ‘Alas!’ above thy clay! It was, perchance, thy joyous pride to stray On Mind's lone shore, and linger by the way: But now thy pilgrim's staff is laid aside, And on thou journeyest o'er the sullen tide, To bless thy wearied sight, and glad thine heart With all that Mind's serener skies impart; Where Wisdom suns the day no shades destroy, And Learning ends in Truth, as hope in joy: While we stand mournful on the desert beach, And wait, and wish, thy distant bark, to reach, And weep to watch it passing from our sight, And sound the gun's salute, and sigh our last ‘good night!’ And oh! while thus the spirit glides away,— Give to the world its memory with its clay! Some page our country's grateful eyes may scan; Some useful truth to bless surviving man; Some name to honest bosoms justly dear; Some grave t' exalt the thought, and claim the tear; So when the pilgrim Sun is travelling o'er The last blue hill, to gild a distant shore, He leaves a freshness in the evening scene, That tells Creation where his steps have been! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. TO MY FATHER ON HIS BIRTH-DAY. “Causa fuit Pater his.” —Hor. Amidst the days of pleasant mirth, That throw their halo round our earth; Amidst the tender thoughts that rise To call bright tears to happy eyes; Amidst the silken words that move To syllable the names we love; There glides no day of gentle bliss, More soothing to the heart than this! No thoughts of fondness e'er appear More fond, than those I write of here! No name can e'er on tablet shine, My father! more belov'd than thine! 'Tis sweet, adown the shady past, A lingering look of love to cast— Back th' enchanted world to call, That beamed around us first of all; And walk with Memory fondly o'er The paths, where Hope had been before— Sweet to receive the sylphic sound That breathes in tenderness around, Repeating to the listening ear The names that made our childhood dear— For parted Joy, like Echo, kind, Will leave her dulcet voice behind, To tell, amidst the magic air, How oft she smiled and lingered there. Oh! let the deep Aonian shell Breathe tuneful numbers, clear and well, While the glad Hours, in fair array, Lead on this buxom Holiday; And Time, as on his way he springs, Hates the last bard who gave him wings; For 'neath thy gentleness of praise, My Father! rose my early lays! And when the lyre was scarce awake, I lov'd its strings for thy lov'd sake; Woo'd the kind Muses—but the while Thought only how to win thy smile— My proudest fame—my dearest pride— More dear than all the world beside! And now, perchance, I seek the tone For magic that is more its own; But still my Father's looks remain The best Mæcenas of my strain; My gentlest joy, upon his brow To read the smile, that meets me now— To hear him, in his kindness, say The words,—perchance he'll speak to-day! SPENSERIAN STANZAS ON A BOY OF THREE YEARS OLD. Child of the sunny lockes and beautifull brow! In thoughtfull tendernesse I gaze on thee— Upon thy daintie cheek Expression's glow Daunceth in tyme to thine heart's melodie; Ne mortall wight mote lovelier urchin see! Nathlesse it teens this pensive brest of mine To think—belive the innocent revelrie Shall be eclipsed in those soft blue eyne— Whenso the howre of youth no more for thee shall shine. Ah me! eftsoons thy childhood's pleasaunt dais Shall fly away, and be a whilome thing! And sweetest mearimake, and birthday lais Be reck'd not of, except when memories bring Feres to their embers with awaking wing, To make past love rejoyce thy tender sprite, Albeit the toyles of daunger thee enring! Child of the wavy lockes, and brow of light— Then be thy conscience pure, as now thy face is bright. VERSES TO MY BROTHER. “For we were nurs'd upon the self-same hill.” —Lycidas. I will write down thy name, and when 'tis writ, Will turn me from the hum that mortals keep In the wide world without, and gaze on it! It telleth of the past—calling from sleep Such dear, yet mournful thoughts, as make us smile, and weep. Belov'd and best! what thousand feelings start, As o'er the paper's course my fingers move— My Brother! dearest, kindest as thou art! How can these lips my heart's affection prove? I could not speak the words, if words could speak my love. Together have we past our infant hours, Together sported Childhood's spring away, Together cull'd young Hope's fast budding flowers, To wreathe the forehead of each coming day! Yes! for the present's sun makes e'en the future gay. And when the laughing mood was nearly o'er, Together, many a minute did we wile On Horace' page, or Maro's sweeter lore; While one young critic, on the classic style, Would sagely try to frown, and make the other smile. But now alone thou con'st the ancient tome— And sometimes thy dear studies, it may be, Are cross'd by dearer dreams of me and home! Alone I muse on Homer—thoughts are free— And if mine often stray, they go in search of thee! I may not praise thee here—I will not bless! Yet all thy goodness doth my memory bear, Cherish'd by more than Friendship's tenderness— And, in the silence of my evening prayer, Thou shalt not be forgot—thy dear name shall be there! STANZAS ON THE DEATH OF LORD BYRON. “? ???? ????? ???????.” —Bion. “? I am not now That which I have been.” —Childe Harold. He was, and is not! Græcia's trembling shore, Sighing through all her palmy groves, shall tell That Harold's pilgrimage at last is o'er— Mute the impassioned tongue, and tuneful shell, That erst was wont in noblest strains to swell— Hush'd the proud shouts that rode Ægæa's wave! For lo! the great Deliv'rer breathes farewell! Gives to the world his mem'ry and a grave— Expiring in the land he only lived to save! Mourn, Hellas, mourn! and o'er thy widow'd brow, For aye, the cypress wreath of sorrow twine; And in thy new-form'd beauty, desolate, throw The fresh-cull'd flowers on his sepulchral shrine. Yes! let that heart whose fervour was all thine, In consecrated urn lamented be! That generous heart where genius thrill'd divine, Hath spent its last most glorious throb for thee— Then sank amid the storm that made thy children free! Britannia's Poet! Græcia's hero, sleeps! And Freedom, bending o'er the breathless clay, Lifts up her voice, and in her anguish weeps! For us, a night hath clouded o'er our day, And hush'd the lips that breath'd our fairest lay. Alas! and must the British lyre resound A requiem, while the spirit wings away Of him who on its strings such music found, And taught its startling chords to give so sweet a sound! The theme grows sadder—but my soul shall find A language in these tears! No more—no more! Soon, 'midst the shriekings of the tossing wind, The ‘dark blue depths’ he sang of, shall have bore Our all of Byron to his native shore! His grave is thick with voices—to the ear Murm'ring an awful tale of greatness o'er; But Memory strives with Death, and lingering near, Shall consecrate the dust of Harold's lonely bier! MEMORY. My Fancy's steps have often strayed To some fair vale the hills have made; Where sparkling waters travel o'er, And hold a mirror to the shore; Winding with murmurings in and out, To find the flowers which grow about. And there, perchance, in childhood bold, Some little elf, four summers old, Adown the vales may chance to run, To hunt his shadow in the sun! But when the waters meet his eyes, He starts and stops with glad surprise, And shouts, with merry voice, to view The banks of green, the skies of blue, Th' inverted flocks that bleating go, Lilies, and trees of apple blow, Seeming so beautiful below! He peeps above—he glances round, And then looks down, and thinks he's found Reposing in the stream, to woo one, A world ev'n lovelier than the true one. Thus, with visions gay and light, Hath Fancy lov'd my page to dight; Yet Thought hath, through a vista, seen Something less frivolous I ween: Then, while my chatting pen runs on, I'll tell you what she dreamt upon. Memory's the streamlet of the scene, Which sweeps the hills of life between; And, when our walking hour is past, Upon its shore we rest at last; And love to view the waters fair, And see lost joys depictured there. My ?, when thy feet are led To press those banks we all must tread— May Virtue's smile, and Learning's praise, Adorn the waters to thy gaze; And, o'er their lucid course, be lent The sunshine of a life well spent! Then, if a thought should glad thy breast Of those who loved thee first and best, My name, perchance, may haunt the spot, Not quite unprized—nor all forgot. TO ?. Mine is a wayward lay; And, if its echoing rhymes I try to string, Proveth a truant thing, Whenso some names I love, send it away! For then, eyes swimming o'er, And claspëd hands, and smiles in fondness meant, Are much more eloquent— So it had fain begone, and speak no more! Yet shall it come again, Ah, friend belov'd! if so thy wishes be, And, with wild melody, I will, upon thine ear, cadence my strain— Cadence my simple line, Unfashion'd by the cunning hand of Art, But coming from my heart, To tell the message of its love to thine! As ocean shells, when taken From Ocean's bed, will faithfully repeat Her ancient music sweet— Ev'n so these words, true to my heart, shall waken! Oh! while our bark is seen, Our little bark of kindly, social love, Down life's clear stream to move Toward the summer shores, where all is green— So long thy name shall bring, Echoes of joy unto the grateful gales, And thousand tender tales, To freshen the fond hearts that round thee cling! Hast thou not look'd upon The flowerets of the field in lowly dress? Blame not my simpleness— Think only of my love!—my song is gone. STANZAS OCCASIONED BY A PASSAGE IN MR. EMERSON'S JOURNAL, WHICH STATES, THAT ON THE MENTION OF LORD BYRON'S NAME, CAPTAIN DEMETRIUS, AN OLD ROUMELIOT, BURST INTO TEARS. Name not his name, or look afar— For when my spirit hears That name, its strength is turned to woe— My voice is turned to tears. Name me the host and battle-storm, Mine own good sword shall stem; Name me the foeman and the block, I have a smile for them! But name him not, or cease to mark This brow where passions sweep— Behold, a warrior is a man, And as a man may weep! I could not scorn my Country's foes, Did not these tears descend— I could not love my Country's fame, And not my Country's Friend. Deem not his memory e'er can be Upon our spirits dim— Name us the generous and the free, And we must think of him! For his voice resounded through our land Like the voice of liberty, As when the war-trump of the wind Upstirs our dark blue sea. His arm was in the foremost rank, Where embattled thousands roll— His name was in the love of Greece, And his spell was on her soul! But the arm that wielded her good sword, The brow that wore the wreath, The lips that breathed the deathless thoughts— They went asleep in death. Ye left his heart, when ye took away The dust in funeral state; And we dumbly placed in a little urn, That home of all things great. The banner streamed—the war-shout rose— Our heroes played their part; But not a pulse would throb or burn— Oh! could it be his heart! I will not think—'tis worse than vain Upon such thoughts to keep; Then, Briton, name me not his name— I cannot choose but weep! THE PAST. There is a silence upon the Ocean, Albeit it swells with a feverish motion; Like to the battle-camp's fearful calm, While the banners are spread, and the warriors arm. The winds beat not their drum to the waves, But sullenly moan in the distant caves; Talking over, before they rise, Some of their dark conspiracies. And so it is in this life of ours, A calm may be on the present hours, But the calmest hour of festive glee May turn the mother of woe to thee. I will betake me to the Past, And she shall make my love at last; I will find my home in her tarrying-place— I will gaze all day on her deathly face! Her form, though awful, is fair to view; The clasp of her hand, though cold, is true; Her shadowy brow hath no changefulness, And her numbered smiles can grow no less! Her voice is like a pleasant song, Which we have not heard for very long, And which a joy on our souls will cast, Though we know not where we heard it last. She shall walk with me, away, away, Where'er the mighty have left their clay; She shall speak to me in places lone, With a low and holy tone. Ay! when I have lit my lamp at night, She will be present with my sprite; And I will say, whate'er it be, Every word she telleth me! THE PRAYER. Methought that I did stand upon a tomb— And all was silent as the dust beneath, While feverish thoughts upon my soul would come, Losing my words in tears: I thought of death; And prayed that when my lips gave out the breath, The friends I loved like life might stay behind: So, for a little while, my name might eath Be something dear,—spoken with voices kind, Heard with remembering looks, from eyes which tears would blind! I prayed that I might sink unto my rest, (O foolish, selfish prayer!) before them all; So I might look my last on those loved best— So never would my voice repining call, And never would my tears impassioned fall On one familiar face turning to clay! So would my tune of life be musical, Albeit abrupt—like airs the Spaniards play, Which in the sweetest part, break off, and die away. Methought I looked around! the scene was rife With little vales, green banks, and waters heaving; And every living thing did joy in life, And every thing of beauty did seem living— Oh, then, life's pulse was at my heart reviving; And then I knew that it was good to bear Dispensëd woe, that by the spirit's grieving, It might be weanëd from a world so fair!— Thus with submissive words mine heart did close its prayer. ON A PICTURE OF RIEGO'S WIDOW, PLACED IN THE EXHIBITION. Daughter of Spain! a passer by May mark the cheek serenely pale— The dark eyes which dream silently, And the calm lip which gives no wail! Calm! it bears not a deeper trace Of feelings it disdained to show; We look upon the Widow's face, And only read the Patriot's woe! No word, no look, no sigh of thine, Would make his glory seem more dim; Thou would'st not give to vulgar eyne The sacred tear which fell for him. Thou would'st not hold to the world's view Thy ruined joys, thy broken heart— The jeering world—it only knew Of all thine anguish—that thou wert! While o'er his grave thy steps would go With a firm tread,—stilling thy love,— As if the dust would blush below To feel one faltering foot above. For Spain, he dared the noble strife— For Spain, he gave his latest breath; And he who lived the Patriot's life, Was dragged to die the traitor's death! And the shout of thousands swept around, As he stood the traitor's block beside; But his dying lips gave a free sound— Let the foe weep!—thy brow had pride! Yet haply in the midnight air, When none might part thy God and thee, The lengthened sob, the passionate prayer, Have spoken thy soul's agony! But silent else, thou past away— The plaint unbreath'd, the anguish hid— More voiceless than the echoing clay Which idly knocked thy coffin's lid. Peace be to thee! while Britons seek This place, if British souls they bear, 'Twill start the crimson in the cheek To see Riego's widow there! SONG. [Weep, as if you thought of laughter!] Weep, as if you thought of laughter! Smile, as tears were coming after! Marry your pleasures to your woes; And think life's green well worth its rose! No sorrow will your heart betide, Without a comfort by its side; The sun may sleep in his sea-bed, But you have starlight overhead. Trust not to Joy! the rose of June, When opened wide, will wither soon; Italian days without twilight Will turn them suddenly to night. Joy, most changeful of all things, Flits away on rainbow wings; And when they look the gayest, know, It is that they are spread to go! THE DREAM. A FRAGMENT. I had a dream!—my spirit was unbound From the dark iron of its dungeon, clay, And rode the steeds of Time;—my thoughts had sound, And spoke without a word,—I went away Among the buried ages, and did lay The pulses of my heart beneath the touch Of the rude minstrel Time, that he should play Thereon, a melody which might seem such As musing spirits love—mournful, but not too much! I had a dream—and there mine eyes did see The shadows of past deeds like present things— The sepulchres of Greece and Hespery, Ægyptus, and old landes, gave up their kings, Their prophets, saints, and minstrels, whose lute-strings Keep a long echo—yea, the dead, white bones Did stand up by the house whereto Death clings, And dressed themselves in life, speaking of thrones, And fame, and power, and beauty, in familiar tones! I went back further still, for I beheld What time the earth was one fair Paradise— And over such bright meads the waters welled, I wot the rainbow was content to rise Upon the earth, when absent from the skies! And there were tall trees that I never knew, Whereon sate nameless birds in merry guise, Folding their radiant wings, as the flowers do, When summer nights send sleep down with the dew. Anon there came a change—a terrible motion, That made all living things grow pale and shake! The dark Heavens bowed themselves unto the ocean, Like a strong man in strife—Ocean did take His flight across the mountains; and the lake Was lashed into a sea where the winds ride— Earth was no more, for in her merrymake She had forgot her God—Sin claimed his bride, And with his vampire breath sucked out her life's fair tide! Life went back to her nostrils, and she raised Her spirit from the waters once again— The lovely sights, on which I erst had gazed, Were not—though she was beautiful as when The Grecian called her “Beauty”—sinful men Walked i' the track of the waters, and felt bold— Yea, they looked up to Heaven in calm disdain, As if no eye had seen its vault unfold Darkness, and fear, and death!—as if a tale were told! And ages fled away within my dream; And still Sin made the heart his dwelling-place, Eclipsing Heaven from men; but it would seem That two or three dared commune face to face, And speak of the soul's life, of hope, and grace— Anon there rose such sounds as angels breathe— For a God came to die, bringing down peace— “Pan was not;” and the darkness that did wreathe The earth, past from the soul—Life came by death! RIGA'S LAST SONG. I have looked my last on my native land, And over these strings I throw my hand, To say in the death-hour's minstrelsy, Hellas, my country! farewell to thee! I have looked my last on my native shore; I shall tread my country's plains no more; But my last thought is of her fame; But my last breath speaketh her name! And though these lips shall soon be still, They may now obey the spirit's will; Though the dust be fettered, the spirit is free— Hellas, my country! farewell to thee! I go to death—but I leave behind The stirrings of Freedom's mighty mind; Her voice shall arise from plain to sky, Her steps shall tread where my ashes lie! I looked on the mountains of proud Souli, And the mountains they seemed to look on me; I spoke my thought on Marathon's plain, And Marathon seemed to speak again! And as I journeyed on my way, I saw an infant group at play; One shouted aloud in his childish glee, And showed me the heights of Thermopylæ! I gazed on peasants hurrying by,— The dark Greek pride crouched in their eye; So I swear in my death-hour's minstrelsy, Hellas, my country! thou shalt be free! No more!—I dash my lyre on the ground— I tear its strings from their home of sound— For the music of slaves shall never keep Where the hand of a freeman was wont to sweep! And I bend my brows above the block, Silently waiting the swift death shock; For these lips shall speak what becomes the free— Or—Hellas, my country! farewell to thee! He bowed his head with a Patriot's pride, And his dead trunk fell the mute lyre beside! The soul of each had past away— Soundless the strings—breathless the clay! THE VISION OF FAME. Did ye ever sit on summer noon, Half musing and half asleep, When ye smile in such a dreamy way, Ye know not if ye weep— When the little flowers are thick beneath, And the welkin blue above; When there is not a sound but the cattle's low, And the voice of the woodland dove? A while ago and I dreamëd thus— I mused on ancient story,— For the heart like a minstrel of old doth seem, It delighteth to sing of glory. What time I saw before me stand, A bright and lofty One; A golden lute was in her hand, And her brow drooped thereon. But the brow that drooped was raisëd soon, Shewing its royal sheen— It was, I guessed, no human brow, Though pleasant to human een. And this brow of peerless majesty, With its whiteness did enshroud Two eyes, that, darkly mystical, 'Gan look up at a cloud. Like to the hair of Bereníce, Fetch'd from its house of light, Was the hair which wreathed her shadowless form— And Fame the ladye hight! But as she wended on to me, My heart's deep fear was chidden; For she called up the sprite of Melody, Which in her lute lay hidden. When ye speak to well-belovëd ones, Your voice is tender and low: The wires methought did love her touch— For they did answer so. And her lips in such a quiet way Gave the chant soft and long,— You might have thought she only breathed, And that her breath was song:— “When Death shrouds thy memory, Love is no shrine— The dear eyes that weep for thee, Soon sleep like thine! The wail murmured over thee, Fainteth away; And the heart which kept love for thee, Turns into clay! “But would'st thou remembered be, Make me thy vow; This verse that flows gushingly, Telleth thee how— Linking thy hand in mine, Listen to me, So not a thought of thine Dieth with thee— “Rifle thy pulsing heart Of the gift, love made; Bid thine eye's light depart; Let thy cheek fade! Give me the slumber deep, Which night-long seems; Give me the joys that creep Into thy dreams! “Give me thy youthful years, Merriest that fly— So the word, spoke in tears, Liveth for aye! So thy sepulchral stone, Nations may raise— What time thy soul hath known The worth of praise!” She did not sing this chant to me, Though I was sitting by; But I listened to it with chainëd breath, That had no power to sigh. And ever as the chant went on, Its measure changed to wail; And ever as the lips sang on, Her face did grow more pale. Paler and paler—till anon A fear came o'er my soul; For the flesh curled up from her bones, Like to a blasted scroll! Ay! silently it dropped away, Before my wondering sight— There was only a bleachëd skeleton, Where erst was ladye bright! But still the vacant sockets gleamed With supernatural fires— But still the boney hands did ring Against the shuddering wires! Alas, alas! I wended home, With a sorrow and a shame— Is Fame the rest of our poor hearts? Woe's me! for this is FAME! POEMS. 1833 THE TEMPEST. A FRAGMENT. “Mors erat ante oculos.” —Lucan, lib. ix. The forest made my home—the voiceful streams My minstrel throng: the everlasting hills,— Which marry with the firmament, and cry Unto the brazen thunder, ‘Come away, Come from thy secret place, and try our strength,’— Enwrapp'd me with their solemn arms. Here, light Grew pale as darkness, scarëd by the shade O' the forest Titans. Here, in piny state, Reign'd Night, the Æthiopian queen, and crown'd The charmëd brow of Solitude, her spouse. A sign was on creation. You beheld All things encolour'd in a sulph'rous hue, As day were sick with fear. The haggard clouds O'erhung the utter lifelessness of air; The top boughs of the forest all aghast, Stared in the face of Heav'n; the deep-mouth'd wind, That hath a voice to bay the armëd sea, Fled with a low cry like a beaten hound; And only that askance the shadows, flew Some open-beakëd birds in wilderment, Naught stirr'd abroad. All dumb did Nature seem, In expectation of the coming storm. It came in power. You soon might hear afar The footsteps of the martial thunder sound Over the mountain battlements; the sky Being deep-stain'd with hues fantastical, Red like to blood, and yellow like to fire, And black like plumes at funerals; overhead You might behold the lightning faintly gleam Amid the clouds which thrill and gape aside, And straight again shut up their solemn jaws, As if to interpose between Heaven's wrath And Earth's despair. Interposition brief! Darkness is gathering out her mighty pall Above us, and the pent-up rain is loosed, Down trampling in its fierce delirium. Was not my spirit gladden'd, as with wine, To hear the iron rain, and view the mark Of battle on the banner of the clouds? Did I not hearken for the battle-cry, And rush along the bowing woods to meet The riding Tempest—skyey cataracts Hissing around him with rebellion vain? Yea! and I lifted up my glorying voice In an ‘All hail;’ when, wildly resonant, As brazen chariots rushing from the war, As passion'd waters gushing from the rock, As thousand crashëd woods, the thunder cried: And at his cry the forest tops were shook As by the woodman's axe; and far and near Stagger'd the mountains with a mutter'd dread. All hail unto the lightning! hurriedly His lurid arms are glaring through the air, Making the face of heav'n to show like hell! Let him go breathe his sulphur stench about, And, pale with death's own mission, lord the storm! Again the gleam—the glare: I turn'd to hail Death's mission: at my feet there lay the dead! The dead—the dead lay there! I could not view (For Night espoused the storm, and made all dark) Its features, but the lightning in his course Shiver'd above a white and corpse-like heap, Stretch'd in the path, as if to show his prey, And have a triumph ere he pass'd. Then I Crouch'd down upon the ground, and groped about Until I touch'd that thing of flesh, rain-drench'd, And chill, and soft. Nathless, I did refrain My soul from natural horror! I did lift The heavy head, half-bedded in the clay, Unto my knee; and pass'd my fingers o'er The wet face, touching every lineament, Until I found the brow; and chafed its chill, To know if life yet linger'd in its pulse. And while I was so busied, there did leap From out the entrails of the firmament, The lightning, who his white unblenching breath Blew in the dead man's face, discov'ring it As by a staring day. I knew that face— His, who did hate me—his, whom I did hate! I shrunk not—spake not—sprang not from the ground! But felt my lips shake without cry or breath, And mine heart wrestle in my breast to still The tossing of its pulses; and a cold, Instead of living blood, o'ercreep my brow. Albeit such darkness brooded all around, I had dread knowledge that the open eyes Of that dead man were glaring up to mine, With their unwinking, unexpressive stare; And mine I could not shut nor turn away. The man was my familiar. I had borne Those eyes to scowl on me their living hate, Better than I could bear their deadliness: I had endured the curses of those lips, Far better than their silence. Oh constrain'd And awful silence!—awful peace of death! There is an answer to all questioning, That one word—death. Our bitterness can throw No look upon the face of death, and live. The burning thoughts that erst my soul illumed, Were quench'd at once; as tapers in a pit Wherein the vapour-witches weirdly reign In charge of darkness. Farewell all the past! It was out-blotted from my memory's eyes, When clay's cold silence pleaded for its sin. Farewell the elemental war! farewell The clashing of the shielded clouds—the cry Of scathëd echoes! I no longer knew Silence from sound, but wander'd far away Into the deep Eleusis of mine heart, To learn its secret things. When armëd foes Meet on one deck with impulse violent, The vessel quakes thro' all her oaken ribs, And shivers in the sea; so with mine heart: For there had battled in her solitudes, Contrary spirits; sympathy with power, And stooping unto power;—the energy And passiveness,—the thunder and the death! Within me was a nameless thought: it closed The Janus of my soul on echoing hinge, And said ‘Peace!’ with a voice like War's. I bow'd, And trembled at its voice: it gave a key, Empower'd to open out all mysteries Of soul and flesh; of man, who doth begin, But endeth not; of life, and after life. Day came at last: her light show'd gray and sad, As hatch'd by tempest, and could scarce prevail Over the shaggy forest to imprint Its outline on the sky—expressionless, Almost sans shadow as sans radiance: An idiocy of light. I waken'd from My deep unslumb'ring dream, but utter'd naught. My living I uncoupled from the dead, And look'd out, 'mid the swart and sluggish air, For place to make a grave. A mighty tree Above me, his gigantic arms outstretch'd, Poising the clouds. A thousand mutter'd spells Of every ancient wind and thund'rous storm, Had been off-shaken from his scathless bark. He had heard distant years sweet concord yield, And go to silence; having firmly kept Majestical companionship with Time. Anon his strength wax'd proud: his tusky roots Forced for themselves a path on every side, Riving the earth; and, in their savage scorn, Casting it from them like a thing unclean, Which might impede his naked clambering Unto the heavens. Now blasted, peel'd, he stood, By the gone night, whose lightning had come in And rent him, even as it rent the man Beneath his shade: and there the strong and weak Communion join'd in deathly agony. There, underneath, I lent my feverish strength, To scoop a lodgment for the traveller's corse. I gave it to the silence and the pit, And strew'd the heavy earth on all: and then— I—I, whose hands had form'd that silent house,— I could not look thereon, but turn'd and wept! Oh Death—oh crownëd Death—pale-steedëd Death! Whose name doth make our respiration brief, Muffling the spirit's drum! Thou, whom men know Alone by charnel-houses, and the dark Sweeping of funeral feathers, and the scath Of happy days,—love deem'd inviolate! Thou of the shrouded face, which to have seen Is to be very awful, like thyself!— Thou, whom all flesh shall see!—thou, who dost call, And there is none to answer!—thou, whose call Changeth all beauty into what we fear, Changeth all glory into what we tread, Genius to silence, wrath to nothingness, And love—not love!—thou hast no change for love! Thou, who art Life's betroth'd, and bear'st her forth To scare her with sad sights,—who hast thy joy Where'er the peopled towns are dumb with plague,— Where'er the battle and the vulture meet,— Where'er the deep sea writhes like Laocoon Beneath the serpent winds, and vessels split On secret rocks, and men go gurgling down, Down, down, to lose their shriekings in the depth! Oh universal thou! who comest aye Among the minstrels, and their tongue is tied;— Among the sophists, and their brain is still;— Among the mourners, and their wail is done;— Among the dancers, and their tinkling feet No more make echoes on the tombing earth;— Among the wassail rout, and all the lamps Are quench'd; and wither'd the wine-pouring hands! Mine heart is armëd not in panoply Of the old Roman iron, nor assumes The Stoic valour. 'Tis a human heart And so confesses, with a human fear;— That only for the hope the cross inspires, That only for the man who died and lives, 'Twould crouch beneath thy sceptre's royalty, With faintness of the pulse, and backward cling To life. But knowing what I soothly know, High-seeming Death, I dare thee! and have hope, In God's good time, of showing to thy face An unsuccumbing spirit, which sublime May cast away the low anxieties That wait upon the flesh—the reptile moods; And enter that eternity to come, Where live the dead, and only Death shall die. A SEA-SIDE MEDITATION. “Ut per aquas quæ nunc rerum simulacra videmus.” —Lucretius, lib. i. Go, travel 'mid the hills! The summer's hand Hath shaken pleasant freshness o'er them all. Go, travel 'mid the hills! There, tuneful streams Are touching myriad stops, invisible; And winds, and leaves, and birds, and your own thoughts, (Not the least glad) in wordless chorus, crowd Around the thymele The central point of the choral movements in the Greek theatre. of Nature. Go, And travel onward. Soon shall leaf and bird, Wind, stream, no longer sound. Thou shalt behold Only the pathless sky, and houseless sward; O'er which anon are spied innumerous sails Of fisher vessels like the wings o' the hill, And white as gulls above them, and as fast,— But sink they—sink they out of sight. And now The wind is springing upward in your face; And, with its fresh-toned gushings, you may hear Continuous sound which is not of the wind, Nor of the thunder, nor o' the cataract's Deep passion, nor o' the earthquake's wilder pulse; But which rolls on in stern tranquillity, As memories of evil o'er the soul;— Boweth the bare broad Heav'n.—What view you? sea—and sea! The sea—the glorious sea! from side to side, Swinging the grandeur of his foamy strength, And undersweeping the horizon,—on— On—with his life and voice inscrutable. Pause: sit you down in silence! I have read Of that Athenian, who, when ocean raged, Unchain'd the prison'd music of his lips, By shouting to the billows, sound for sound. I marvel how his mind would let his tongue Affront thereby the ocean's solemnness. Are we not mute, or speak restrainedly, When overhead the trampling tempests go, Dashing their lightning from their hoofs? and when We stand beside the bier? and when we see The strong bow down to weep—and stray among Places which dust or mind hath sanctified? Yea! for such sights and acts do tear apart The close and subtle clasping of a chain, Form'd not of gold, but of corroded brass, Whose links are furnish'd from the common mine Of every day's event, and want, and wish; From work-times, diet-times, and sleeping-times: And thence constructed, mean and heavy links Within the pandemonic walls of sense, Enchain our deathless part, constrain our strength, And waste the goodly stature of our soul. Howbeit, we love this bondage; we do cleave Unto the sordid and unholy thing, Fearing the sudden wrench required to break Those claspëd links. Behold! all sights and sounds In air, and sea, and earth, and under earth, All flesh, all life, all ends, are mysteries; And all that is mysterious dreadful seems, And all we cannot understand we fear. Ourselves do scare ourselves: we hide our sight In artificial nature from the true, And throw sensation's veil associative On God's creation, man's intelligence; Bowing our high imaginings to eat Dust, like the serpent, once erect as they; Binding conspicuous on our reason's brow Phylacteries of shame; learning to feel By rote, and act by rule, (man's rule, not God's!) Until our words grow echoes, and our thoughts A mechanism of spirit. Can this last? No! not for aye. We cannot subject aye The heav'n-born spirit to the earth-born flesh. Tame lions will scent blood, and appetite Carnivorous glare from out their restless eyes. Passions, emotions, sudden changes, throw Our nature back upon us, till we burn. What warm'd Cyrene's fount? As poets sing, The change from light to dark, from dark to light. All that doth force this nature back on us, All that doth force the mind to view the mind, Engend'reth what is named by men, sublime. Thus when, our wonted valley left, we gain The mountain's horrent brow, and mark from thence The sweep of lands extending with the sky; Or view the spanless plain; or turn our sight Upon yon deep's immensity;—we breathe As if our breath were marble: to and fro Do reel our pulses, and our words are mute. We cannot mete by parts, but grapple all: We cannot measure with our eye, but soul; And fear is on us. The extent unused, Our spirit, sends, to spirit's element, To seize upon abstractions: first on space, The which eternity in place I deem; And then upon eternity; till thought Hath form'd a mirror from their secret sense, Wherein we view ourselves, and back recoil At our own awful likeness; ne'ertheless, Cling to that likeness with a wonder wild, And while we tremble, glory—proud in fear. So ends the prose of life: and so shall be Unlock'd her poetry's magnific store. And so, thou pathless and perpetual sea, So, o'er thy deeps, I brooded and must brood, Whether I view thee in thy dreadful peace, Like a spent warrior hanging in the sun His glittering arms, and meditating death; Or whether thy wild visage gath'reth shades, What time thou marshall'st forth thy waves who hold A covenant of storms, then roar and wind Under the racking rocks; as martyrs lie Wheel-bound; and, dying, utter lofty words! Whether the strength of day is young and high, Or whether, weary of the watch, he sits Pale on thy wave, and weeps himself to death;— In storm and calm, at morn and eventide, Still have I stood beside thee, and out-thrown My spirit onward on thine element,— Beyond thine element,—to tremble low Before those feet which trod thee as they trod Earth,—to the holy, happy, peopled place, Where there is no more sea. Yea, and my soul, Having put on thy vast similitude, Hath wildly moanëd at her proper depth, Echoed her proper musings, veil'd in shade Her secrets of decay, and exercised An elemental strength, in casting up Rare gems and things of death on fancy's shore, Till Nature said, ‘Enough.’ Who longest dreams, Dreams not for ever; seeing day and night And corporal feebleness divide his dreams, And on his elevate creations weigh With hunger, cold, heat, darkness, weariness: Else should we be like gods; else would the course Of thought's free wheels, increased in speed and might By an eterne volution, oversweep The heights of wisdom, and invade her depths: So, knowing all things, should we have all power; For is not knowledge power? But mighty spells Our operation sear; the Babel must, Or ere it touch the sky, fall down to earth: The web, half form'd, must tumble from our hands, And, ere they can resume it, lie decay'd. Mind struggles vainly from the flesh. E'en so, Hell's angel (saith a scroll apocryphal) Shall, when the latter days of earth have shrunk Before the blast of God, affect his heav'n; Lift his scarr'd brow, confirm his rebel heart, Shoot his strong wings, and darken pole and pole,— Till day be blotted into night; and shake The fever'd clouds, as if a thousand storms Throbb'd into life! Vain hope—vain strength—vain flight! God's arm shall meet God's foe, and hurl him back! A VISION OF LIFE AND DEATH. Mine ears were deaf to melody, My lips were dumb to sound: Where didst thou wander, oh my soul, When ear and tongue were bound? ‘I wander'd by the stream of time, Made dark by human tears: I threw my voice upon the waves, And they did throw me theirs.’ And how did sound the waves, my soul? And how did sound the waves? ‘Hoarse, hoarse, and wild!—they ever dash'd 'Gainst ruin'd thrones and graves.’ And what sight on the shore, my soul? And what sight on the shore? ‘Twain beings sate there silently, And sit there evermore.’ Now tell me fast and true, my soul; Now tell me of those twain. ‘One was yclothed in mourning vest, And one, in trappings vain. ‘She, in the trappings vain, was fair, And eke fantastical: A thousand colours dyed her garb; A blackness bound them all. ‘In part her hair was gaily wreath'd, In part was wildly spread: Her face did change its hue too fast, To say 'twas pale or red. ‘And when she look'd on earth, I thought She smiled for very glee: But when she look'd to heav'n, I knew That tears stood in her ee. ‘She held a mirror, there to gaze: It could no cheer bestow; For while her beauty cast the shade, Her breath did make it go. ‘A harper's harp did lie by her, Without the harper's hest; A monarch's crown did lie by her, Wherein an owl had nest: ‘A warrior's sword did lie by her, Grown rusty since the fight; A poet's lamp did lie by her:— Ah me!—where was its light?’ And what didst thou say, O, my soul, Unto that mystic dame? ‘I ask'd her of her tears, and eke I ask'd her of her name. ‘She said, she built a prince's throne: She said, he ruled the grave; And that the levelling worm ask'd not If he were king or slave. ‘She said, she form'd a godlike tongue, Which lofty thoughts unsheathed; Which roll'd its thunder round, and purged The air the nations breathed. ‘She said, that tongue, all eloquent, With silent dust did mate; Whereon false friends betray'd long faith, And foes outspat their hate. ‘She said, she warm'd a student's heart, But heart and brow 'gan fade: Alas, alas! those Delphic trees Do cast an upas shade! ‘She said, she lighted happy hearths, Whose mirth was all forgot: She said, she tunëd marriage bells, Which rang when love was not. ‘She said, her name was Life; and then Out laugh'd and wept aloud,— What time the other being strange Lifted the veiling shroud. ‘Yea! lifted she the veiling shroud, And breathed the icy breath; Whereat, with inward shuddering, I knew her name was Death. ‘Yea! lifted she her calm, calm brow, Her clear cold smile on me: Whereat within my deepness, leap'd Mine immortality. ‘She told me, it did move her smile, To witness how I sigh'd, Because that what was fragile brake, And what was mortal died: ‘As if that kings could grasp the earth, Who from its dust began; As if that suns could shine at night, Or glory dwell with man. ‘She told me, she had freed his soul, Who aye did freedom love; Who now reck'd not, were worms below, Or ranker worms above! ‘She said, the student's heart had beat Against its prison dim; Until she crush'd the bars of flesh, And pour'd truth's light on him. ‘She said, that they who left the hearth, For aye in sunshine dwell; She said, the funeral tolling brought More joy than marriage bell! ‘And as she spake, she spake less loud; The stream resounded more: Anon I nothing heard but waves That wail'd along the shore.’ And what didst thou say, oh my soul, Upon that mystic strife? ‘I said, that Life was only Death, That only Death was Life.’ EARTH. How beautiful is earth! my starry thoughts Look down on it from their unearthly sphere, And sing symphonious—Beautiful is earth! The lights and shadows of her myriad hills; The branching greenness of her myriad woods; Her sky-affecting rocks; her zoning sea; Her rushing, gleaming cataracts; her streams That race below, the wingëd clouds on high; Her pleasantness of vale and meadow!— Hush! Meseemeth through the leafy trees to ring A chime of bells to falling waters tuned; Whereat comes heathen Zephyrus, out of breath With running up the hills, and shakes his hair From off his gleesome forehead, bold and glad With keeping blythe Dan Phœbus company;— And throws him on the grass, though half afraid; First glancing round, lest tempests should be nigh; And lays close to the ground his ruddy lips, And shapes their beauty into sound, and calls On all the petall'd flowers that sit beneath In hiding-places from the rain and snow, To loosen the hard soil, and leave their cold Sad idlesse, and betake them up to him. They straightway hear his voice— A thought did come, And press from out my soul the heathen dream. Mine eyes were purgëd. Straightway did I bind Round me the garment of my strength, and heard Nature's death-shrieking—the hereafter cry, When he o' the lion voice, the rainbow-crown'd, Shall stand upon the mountains and the sea, And swear by earth, by heaven's throne, and Him Who sitteth on the throne, there shall be time No more, no more! Then, veil'd Eternity Shall straight unveil her awful countenance Unto the reeling worlds, and take the place Of seasons, years, and ages. Aye and aye Shall be the time of day. The wrinkled heav'n Shall yield her silent sun, made blind and white With an exterminating light: the wind, Unchainëd from the poles, nor having charge Of cloud or ocean, with a sobbing wail Shall rush among the stars, and swoon to death. Yea, the shrunk earth, appearing livid pale Beneath the red-tongued flame, shall shudder by From out her ancient place, and leave—a void. Yet haply by that void the saints redeem'd May sometimes stray; when memory of sin Ghost-like shall rise upon their holy souls; And on their lips shall lie the name of earth In paleness and in silentness; until Each looking on his brother, face to face, And bursting into sudden happy tears, (The only tears undried) shall murmur—‘Christ!’ THE PICTURE GALLERY AT PENSHURST. They spoke unto me from the silent ground, They look'd unto me from the pictured wall: The echo of my footstep was a sound Like to the echo of their own footfall, What time their living feet were in the hall. I breathed where they had breathed—and where they brought Their souls to moralize on glory's pall, I walk'd with silence in a cloud of thought: So, what they erst had learn'd, I mine own spirit taught. Ay! with mine eyes of flesh, I did behold The likeness of their flesh! They, the great dead, Stood still upon the canvass, while I told The glorious memories to their ashes wed. There, I beheld the Sidneys:—he, who bled Freely for freedom's sake, bore gallantly His soul upon his brow;—he, whose lute said Sweet music to the land, meseem'd to be Dreaming with that pale face, of love and Arcadie. Mine heart had shrinëd these. And therefore past Were these, and such as these, in mine heart's pride, Which deem'd death, glory's other name. At last I stay'd my pilgrim feet, and paused beside A picture, Vandyke's portrait of Waller's Sacharissa. which the shadows half did hide. The form was a fair woman's form; the brow Brightly between the clustering curls espied: The cheek a little pale, yet seeming so As, if the lips could speak, the paleness soon would go. And rested there the lips, so warm and loving, That, they could speak, one might be fain to guess: Only they had been much too bright, if moving, To stay by their own will, all motionless. One outstretch'd hand its marble seal 'gan press On roses which look'd fading; while the eyes, Uplifted in a calm, proud loveliness, Seem'd busy with their flow'ry destinies, Drawing, for ladye's heart, some moral quaint and wise. She perish'd like her roses. I did look On her, as she did look on them—to sigh! Alas, alas! that the fair-written book Of her sweet face, should be in death laid by, As any blotted scroll! Its cruelty Poison'd a heart most gentle-pulsed of all, And turn'd it unto song, therein to die: For grief's stern tension maketh musical, Unless the strain'd string break or ere the music fall. Worship of Waller's heart! no dream of thine Reveal'd unto thee, that the lowly one, Who sate enshadow'd near thy beauty's shine, Should, when the light was out, the life was done, Record thy name with those by Memory won From Time's eternal burial. I am woo'd By wholesome thoughts this sad thought hath begun; For mind is strengthen'd when awhile subdued, As he who touch'd the earth, and rose with power renew'd. TO A POET'S CHILD. A far harp swept the sea above; A far voice said thy name in love: Then silence on the harp was cast; The voice was chain'd—the love went last! And as I heard the melodie, Sweet-voicëd Fancy spake of thee: And as the silence o'er it came, Mine heart, in silence, sigh'd thy name. I thought there was one only place, Where thou couldst lift thine orphan'd face; A little home for prayer and woe;— A stone above—a shroud below;— That evermore, that stone beside, Thy wither'd joys would form thy pride; As palm trees, on their south sea bed, Make islands with the flowers they shed. Child of the Dead! my dream of thee Was sad to tell, and dark to see; And vain as many a brighter dream; Since thou canst sing by Babel's stream! For here, amid the worldly crowd, 'Mid common brows, and laughter loud, And hollow words, and feelings sere, Child of the Dead! I meet thee here! And is thy step so fast and light? And is thy smile so gay and bright? And canst thou smile, with cheek undim, Upon a world that frown'd on him? The minstrel's harp is on his bier; What doth the minstrel's orphan here? The loving moulders in the clay; The loved,—she keepeth holyday! 'Tis well! I would not doom thy years Of golden prime, to only tears. Fair girl! 'twere better that thine eyes Should find a joy in summer skies, As if their sun were on thy fate. Be happy; strive not to be great; And go not, from thy kind apart, With lofty soul and stricken heart. Think not too deeply: shallow thought, Like open rills, is ever sought By light and flowers; while fountains deep Amid the rocks and shadows sleep. Feel not too warmly: lest thou be Too like Cyrene's waters free, Which burn at night, when all around In darkness and in chill is found. Touch not the harp to win the wreath: Its tone is fame, its echo death! The wreath may like the laurel grow, Yet turns to cypress on the brow! And, as a flame springs clear and bright, Yet leaveth ashes 'stead of light; So genius (fatal gift)! is doom'd To leave the heart it fired, consumed. For thee, for thee, thou orphan'd one, I make an humble orison! Love all the world; and ever dream That all are true who truly seem. Forget! for, so, 'twill move thee not, Or lightly move; to be forgot! Be streams thy music; hills, thy mirth; Thy chiefest light, the household hearth. So, when grief plays her natural part, And visiteth thy quiet heart; Shall all the clouds of grief be seen To show a sky of hope between. So, when thy beauty senseless lies, No sculptured urn shall o'er thee rise; But gentle eyes shall weep at will, Such tears as hearts like thine distil. MINSTRELSY. One asked her once the resun why, She hadde delyte in minstrelsie, She answerëd on this manére. —Robert de Brunne. For ever, since my childish looks Could rest on Nature's pictured books; For ever, since my childish tongue Could name the themes our bards have sung; So long, the sweetness of their singing Hath been to me a rapture bringing! Yet ask me not the reason why I have delight in minstrelsy. I know that much whereof I sing, Is shapen but for vanishing; I know that summer's flower and leaf And shine and shade are very brief, And that the heart they brighten, may, Before them all, be sheathed in clay!— I do not know the reason why I have delight in minstrelsy. A few there are, whose smile and praise My minstrel hope, would kindly raise: But, of those few—Death may impress The lips of some with silentness; While some may friendship's faith resign, And heed no more a song of mine.— Ask not, ask not the reason why I have delight in minstrelsy. The sweetest song that minstrels sing, Will charm not Joy to tarrying; The greenest bay that earth can grow, Will shelter not in burning woe; A thousand voices will not cheer, When one is mute that aye is dear!— Is there, alas! no reason why I have delight in minstrelsy? I do not know! The turf is green Beneath the rain's fast-dropping sheen, Yet asks not why that deeper hue Doth all its tender leaves renew;— And I, like-minded, am content, While music to my soul is sent, To question not the reason why I have delight in minstrelsy. Years pass—my life with them shall pass: And soon, the cricket in the grass And summer bird, shall louder sing Than she who owns a minstrel's string. Oh then may some, the dear and few, Recall her love, whose truth they knew; When all forget to question why She had delight in minstrelsy! TO THE MEMORY OF SIR UVEDALE PRICE, BART. Farewell!—a word that human lips bestow On all that human hearts delight to know: On summer skies, and scenes that change as fast; On ocean calms, and faith as fit to last; On Life, from Love's own arms, that breaks away; On hopes that blind, and glories that decay! And ever thus, ‘farewell, farewell,’ is said, As round the hills of lengthening time, we tread; As at each step, the winding ways unfold Some untried prospect which obscures the old;— Perhaps a prospect brightly color'd o'er, Yet not with brightness that we loved before; And dull and dark the brightest hue appears To eyes like ours, surcharged and dim with tears. Oft, oft we wish the winding road were past, And yon supernal summit gain'd at last; Where all that gradual change removed, is found At once, for ever, as you look around; Where every scene by tender eyes survey'd, And lost and wept for, to their gaze is spread— No tear to dim the sight, no shade to fall, But Heaven's own sunshine lighting, charming all. Farewell!—a common word—and yet how drear And strange it soundeth as I write it here! How strange that thou a place of death shouldst fill, Thy brain unlighted, and thine heart grown chill! And dark the eye, whose plausive glance to draw, Incited Nature brake her tyrant's law! And deaf the ear, to charm whose organ true, Mæonian music tuned her harp anew! And mute the lips where Plato's bee hath roved; And motionless the hand that genius moved!— Ah friend! thou speakest not!—but still to me Do Genius, Music, Nature, speak of thee!— Still golden fancy, still the sounding line, And waving wood, recall some word of thine: Some word, some look, whose living light is o'er— And Memory sees what Hope can see no more. Twice, twice, thy voice hath spoken. Twice there came To us, a change, a joy—to thee, a fame! Thou spakest once; Essay on the Picturesque. and every pleasant sight, Woods waving wild, and fountains gushing bright, Cool copses, grassy banks, and all the dyes Of shade and sunshine gleam'd before our eyes. Thou spakest twice; Essay on the Pronunciation of the Ancient Languages. and every pleasant sound Its ancient silken harmony unwound, From Doric pipe and Attic lyre that lay Enclasp'd in hands whose cunning is decay. And now no more thou speakest! Death hath met And won thee to him! Oh remember'd yet! We cannot see, and hearken, and forget! My thoughts are far. I think upon the time, When Foxley's purple hills and woods sublime Were thrilling at thy step; when thou didst throw Thy burning spirit on the vale below, To bathe its sense in beauty. Lovely ground! There, never more shall step of thine resound! There, Spring again shall come, but find thee not, And deck with humid eyes her favorite spot; Strew tender green on paths thy foot forsakes, And make that fair, which Memory saddest makes. For me, all sorrowful, unused to raise A minstrel song and dream not of thy praise, Upon thy grave, my tuneless harp I lay, Nor try to sing what only tears can say. So warm and fast the ready waters swell— So weak the faltering voice thou knewest well! Thy words of kindness calm'd that voice before; Now, thoughts of them but make it tremble more; And leave its theme to others, and depart To dwell within the silence where thou art. THE AUTUMN. Go, sit upon the lofty hill, And turn your eyes around, Where waving woods and waters wild Do hymn an autumn sound. The summer sun is faint on them— The summer flowers depart— Sit still—as all transform'd to stone, Except your musing heart. How there you sat in summer-time, May yet be in your mind; And how you heard the green woods sing Beneath the freshening wind. Though the same wind now blows around, You would its blast recall; For every breath that stirs the trees, Doth cause a leaf to fall. Oh! like that wind, is all the mirth That flesh and dust impart: We cannot bear its visitings, When change is on the heart. Gay words and jests may make us smile, When Sorrow is asleep; But other things must make us smile, When Sorrow bids us weep! The dearest hands that clasp our hands,— Their presence may be o'er; The dearest voice that meets our ear, That tone may come no more! Youth fades; and then, the joys of youth, Which once refresh'd our mind, Shall come—as, on those sighing woods, The chilling autumn wind. Hear not the wind—view not the woods; Look out o'er vale and hill: In spring, the sky encircled them— The sky is round them still. Come autumn's scathe—come winter's cold— Come change—and human fate! Whatever prospect Heaven doth bound, Can ne'er be desolate. THE DEATH-BED OF TERESA DEL RIEGO. ? Si fia muta ogni altra cosa, al fine Parlerà il mio morire, E ti dirà la morte il mio martire. —Guarini. The room was darken'd; but a wan lamp shed Its light upon a half-uncurtain'd bed, Whereon the widow'd sate. Blackly as death Her veiling hair hung round her, and no breath Came from her lips to motion it. Between Its parted clouds, the calm fair face was seen In a snow paleness and snow silentness, With eyes unquenchable, whereon did press A little, their white lids, so taught to lie, By weights of frequent tears wept secretly. Her hands were clasp'd and raised—the lamp did fling A glory on her brow's meek suffering. Beautiful form of woman! seeming made Alone to shine in mirrors, there to braid The hair and zone the waist—to garland flowers— To walk like sunshine through the orange bowers— To strike her land's guitar—and often see In other eyes how lovely hers must be— Grew she acquaint with anguish? Did she sever For ever from the one she loved for ever, To dwell among the strangers? Ay! and she, Who shone most brightly in that festive glee, Sate down in this despair most patiently. Some hearts are Niobes! In grief's down-sweeping, They turn to very stone from over-weeping, And after, feel no more. Hers did remain In life, which is the power of feeling pain, Till pain consumed the life so call'd below. She heard that he was dead!—she ask'd not how— For he was dead! She wail'd not o'er his urn, For he was dead—and in her hands, should burn His vestal flame of honor radiantly. Sighing would dim its light—she did not sigh. She only died. They laid her in the ground, Whereon th'unloving tread, and accents sound Which are not of her Spain. She left behind, For those among the strangers who were kind Unto the poor heart-broken, her dark hair. It once was gauded out with jewels rare; It swept her dying pillow—it doth lie Beside me, (thank the giver) droopingly, And very long and bright! Its tale doth go Half to the dumb grave, half to life-time woe, Making the heart of man, if manly, ring Like Dodonæan brass, with echoing. TO VICTOIRE, ON HER MARRIAGE. Victoire! I knew thee in thy land, Where I was strange to all: I heard thee; and were strange to me The words thy lips let fall. I loved thee—for the Babel curse Was meant not for the heart: I parted from thee, in such way As those who love may part. And now a change hath come to us, A sea doth rush between! I do not know if we can be Again as we have been. I sit down in mine English land, Mine English hearth beside; And thou, to one I never knew, Art plighted for a bride. It will not wrong thy present joy, With by-gone days to wend; Nor wrongeth it mine English hearth, To love my Gallic friend. Bind, bind the wreath! the slender ring Thy wedded finger press! May he who calls thy love his own, Call so thine happiness! Be he Terpander to thine heart, And string fresh strings of gold, Which may out-give new melodies, But never mar the old! And though I clasp no more thy hand In my hand, and rejoice— And though I see thy face no more, And hear no more thy voice— Farewell, farewell!—let thought of me Visit thine heart! There is In mine the very selfish prayer That prayeth for thy bliss! TO A BOY. When my last song was said for thee, Thy golden hair swept, long and free, Around thee; and a dove-like tone Was on thy voice—or Nature's own: And every phrase and word of thine Went out in lispings infantine! Thy small steps faltering round our hearth— Thine een out-peering in their mirth— Blue een! that, like thine heart, seem'd given To be, for ever, full of heaven! Wert thou, in sooth, made up of glee, When my last song was said for thee? And now more years are finishëd,— For thee another song is said. Thy voice hath lost its cooing tone; The lisping of thy words is gone: Thy step treads firm—thine hair not flings Round thee its length of golden rings— Departed, like all lovely things! Yet art thou still made up of glee, When my now song is said for thee. Wisely and well responded they, Who cut thy golden hair away, What time I made the bootless prayer, That they should pause awhile, and spare. They said, ‘its sheen did less agree With boyhood than with infancy.’ And thus I know it aye must be. Before the revel noise is done, The revel lamps pale one by one. Ay! Nature loveth not to bring Crown'd victims to life's labouring. The mirth-effulgent eye appears Less sparkling—to make room for tears: After the heart's quick throbs depart, We lose the gladness of the heart: And, after we have lost awhile The rose o' the lip, we lose its smile; As Beauty could not bear to press Near the death-pyre of Happiness. This seemeth but a sombre dream? It hath more pleasant thoughts than seem. The older a young tree doth grow, The deeper shade it sheds below; But makes the grass more green—the air More fresh, than had the sun been there. And thus our human life is found, Albeit a darkness gather round: For patient virtues, that their light May shine to all men, want the night: And holy Peace, unused to cope, Sits meekly at the tomb of Hope, Saying that ‘she is risen!’ Then I Will sorrow not at destiny,— Though from thine eyes, and from thine heart, The glory of their light depart; Though on thy voice, and on thy brow, Should come a fiercer change than now; Though thou no more be made of glee, When my next song is said for thee. REMONSTRANCE. Oh say not it is vain to weep That deafen'd bier above; Where genius has made room for death, And life is past from love; That tears can never his bright looks And tender words restore: I know it is most vain to weep— And therefore, weep the more! Oh say not I shall cease to weep When years have wither'd by; That ever I shall speak of joy, As if he could reply; That ever mine unquivering lips Shall name the name he bore: I know that I may cease to weep, And therefore weep the more! Say, Time, who slew mine happiness, Will leave to me my woe; And woe's own stony strength shall chain These tears' impassion'd flow: Or say, that these, my ceaseless tears, May life to death restore; For then my soul were wept away, And I should weep no more! Reply. To weep awhile beside the bier, Whereon his ashes lie, Is well!—I know that rains must fall When clouds are in the sky: I know, to die—to part, will cloud The brightest spirit o'er; And yet, wouldst thou for ever weep, When he can weep no more? Fix not thy sight, so long and fast, Upon the shroud's despair; Look upward unto Zion's hill, For death was also there! And think, ‘The death, the scourge, the scorn, My sinless Saviour bore— The curse—the pang, too deep for tears— That I should weep no more!’ EPITAPH. Beauty, who softly walkest all thy days, In silken garment to the tunes of praise;— Lover, whose dreamings by the green-bank'd river, Where once she wander'd, fain would last for ever;— King, whom the nations scan, adoring scan, And shout ‘a god,’ when sin hath mark'd thee man;— Bard, on whose brow the Hyblan dew remains, Albeit the fever burneth in the veins;— Hero, whose sword in tyrant's blood is hot;— Sceptic, who doubting, wouldst be doubted not;— Man, whosoe'er thou art, whate'er thy trust;— Respect thyself in me;—thou treadest dust. THE IMAGE OF GOD. “I am God, and there is none like me.” —Isaiah xlvi. 9. “Christ, who is the image of God.” —2 Cor. iv. 4. Thou! art thou like to God? (I ask'd this question of the glorious sun) Thou high unwearied one, Whose course in heat, and light, and life is run? Eagles may view thy face—clouds can assuage Thy fiery wrath—the sage Can mete thy stature—thou shalt fade with age, Thou art not like to God. Thou! art thou like to God? (I ask'd this question of the bounteous earth) Oh thou, who givest birth To forms of beauty and to sounds of mirth? In all thy glory works the worm decay— Thy golden harvests stay For seed and toil—thy power shall pass away. Thou art not like to God. Thou! art thou like to God? (I ask'd this question of my deathless soul) Oh thou, whose musings roll Above the thunder, o'er creation's whole? Thou art not. Sin, and shame, and agony Within thy deepness lie: They utter forth their voice in thee, and cry ‘Thou art not like to God.’ Then art Thou like to God; Thou, who didst bear the sin, and shame, and woe— O Thou, whose sweat did flow— Whose tears did gush—whose brow was dead and low? No grief is like thy grief; no heart can prove Love like unto thy love; And none, save only Thou,—below, above,— Oh God, is like to God! THE APPEAL. Children of our England! stand On the shores that girt our land; The ægis of whose cloud-white rock Braveth Time's own battle shock. Look above the wide, wide world; Where the northern blasts have furl'd Their numbëd wings amid the snows, Mutt'ring in a forced repose— Or where the madden'd sun on high Shakes his torch athwart the sky, Till within their prison sere, Chainëd earthquakes groan for fear! Look above the wide, wide world, Where a gauntlet Sin hath hurl'd To astonied Life; and where Death's gladiatorial smile doth glare, On making the arena bare. Shout aloud the words that show Jesus in the sands and snow;— Shout aloud the words that free, Over the perpetual sea. Speak ye. As a breath will sweep Avalanche from Alpine steep, So the spoken word shall roll Fear and darkness from the soul. Are ye men, and love not man? Love ye, and permit his ban? Can ye, dare ye, rend the chain Wrought of common joy and pain, Clasping with its links of gold, Man to man in one strong hold? Lo! if the golden links ye sever, Ye shall make your heart's flesh quiver; And wheresoe'er the links are reft, There, shall be a blood-stain left. To earth's remotest rock repair, Ye shall find a vulture there: Though for others sorrowing not, Your own tears shall still be hot: Though ye play a lonely part; Though ye bear an iron heart;— Woe, like Echetus, still must Grind your iron into dust. But children of our Britain, ye Rend not man's chain of sympathy; To those who sit in woe and night, Denying tears and hiding light. Ye have stretch'd your hands abroad With the Spirit's sheathless sword: Ye have spoken—and the tone To earth's extremest verge hath gone: East and west sublime it rolls, Echoed by a million souls! The wheels of rapid circling years, Erst hot with crime, are quench'd in tears. Rocky hearts wild waters pour, That were chain'd in stone before: Bloody hands, that only bare Hilted sword, are clasp'd in prayer Savage tongues, that wont to fling Shouts of war in deathly ring, Speak the name which angels sing. Dying lips are lit the while With a most undying smile, Which reposing there, instead Of language, when the lips are dead, Saith,—‘No sound of grief or pain, Shall haunt us when we move again.’ Children of our country! brothers To the children of all others! Shout aloud the words that show Jesus in the sands and snow;— Shout aloud the words that free, Over the perpetual sea! IDOLS. How weak the gods of this world are— And weaker yet their worship made me! I have been an idolater Of three—and three times they betray'd me. Mine oldest worshipping was given To natural Beauty, aye residing In bowery earth and starry heav'n, In ebbing sea, and river gliding. But natural Beauty shuts her bosom To what the natural feelings tell! Albeit I sigh'd, the trees would blossom— Albeit I smiled, the blossoms fell. Then left I earthly sights, to wander Amid a grove of name divine, Where bay-reflecting streams meander, And Moloch Fame hath rear'd a shrine. Not green, but black, is that reflection; On rocky beds those waters lie; That grove hath chilness and dejection— How could I sing? I had to sigh. Last, human Love, thy Lares greeting, To rest and warmth I vow'd my years. To rest? how wild my pulse is beating! To warmth? ah me! my burning tears. Ay! they may burn—though thou be frozen By death, and changes wint'ring on! Fame—Beauty!—idols madly chosen— Were yet of gold; but thou art stone! Crumble like stone! my voice no longer Shall wail their names, who silent be: There is a voice that soundeth stronger— ‘My daughter, give thine heart to me.’ Lord! take mine heart! Oh first and fairest, Whom all creation's ends shall hear; Who deathless love in death declarest! None else is beauteous—famous—dear! HYMN. “Lord, I cry unto thee, make haste unto me.” —Psalm cxli. “The Lord is nigh unto them that call upon him.” —Psalm cxlv. Since without Thee we do no good, And with Thee do no ill, Abide with us in weal and woe,— In action and in will. In weal,—that while our lips confess The Lord who ‘gives,’ we may Remember, with an humble thought, The Lord who ‘takes away.’ In woe,—that, while to drowning tears Our hearts their joys resign, We may remember who can turn Such water into wine. By hours of day,—that when our feet O'er hill and valley run, We still may think the light of truth More welcome than the sun. By hours of night,—that when the air Its dew and shadow yields, We still may hear the voice of God In silence of the fields. Oh! then sleep comes on us like death, All soundless, deaf and deep: Lord! teach us so to watch and pray, That death may come like sleep. Abide with us, abide with us, While flesh and soul agree; And when our flesh is only dust, Abide our souls with Thee. WEARINESS. Mine eyes are weary of surveying The fairest things, too soon decaying; Mine ears are weary of receiving The kindest words—ah, past believing! Weary my hope, of ebb and flow; Weary my pulse, of tunes of woe: My trusting heart is weariest! I would—I would, I were at rest! For me, can earth refuse to fade? For me, can words be faithful made? Will my embitter'd hope be sweet? My pulse forego the human beat? No! Darkness must consume mine eye— Silence, mine ear—hope cease—pulse die— And o'er mine heart a stone be press'd— Or vain this,—‘Would I were at rest!’ There is a land of rest deferr'd: Nor eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, Nor Hope hath trod the precinct o'er; For hope beheld is hope no more! There, human pulse forgets its tone— There, hearts may know as they are known! Oh, for dove's wings, thou dwelling blest, To fly to thee, and be at rest!</field>

THE SERAPHIM. ?? ?? ????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? —Orpheus. “I look for Angels' songs, and hear Him cry.” —Giles Fletcher. PART THE FIRST. [It is the time of the Crucifixion; and the Angels of Heaven have departed towards the Earth, except the two Seraphim, Ador the Strong and Zerah the Bright One. The place is the outer side of the shut Heavenly Gate.] Ador. O Seraph, pause no more! Beside this gate of heaven we stand alone. Zerah. Of heaven! Ador. Our brother hosts are gone— Zerah. Are gone before. Ador. And the golden harps the angels bore To help the songs of their desire, Still burning from their hands of fire, Lie without touch or tone Upon the glass-sea shore. Zerah. Silent upon the glass-sea shore! Ador. There the Shadow from the throne Formless with infinity Hovers o'er the crystal sea Awfuller than light derived, And red with those primæval heats Whereby all life has lived. Zerah. Our visible God, our heavenly seats! Ador. Beneath us sinks the pomp angelical, Cherub and seraph, powers and virtues, all,— The roar of whose descent has died To a still sound, as thunder into rain. Immeasurable space spreads magnified With that thick life, along the plane The worlds slid out on. What a fall And eddy of wings innumerous, crossed By trailing curls that have not lost The glitter of the God-smile shed On every prostrate angel's head! What gleaming up of hands that fling Their homage in retorted rays, From high instinct of worshipping, And habitude of praise! Zerah. Rapidly they drop below us: Pointed palm and wing and hair Indistinguishable show us Only pulses in the air Throbbing with a fiery beat, As if a new creation heard Some divine and plastic word, And trembling at its new-found being, Awakened at our feet. Ador. Zerah, do not wait for seeing! His voice, his, that thrills us so As we our harpstrings, uttered Go, Behold the Holy in his woe! And all are gone, save thee and— Zerah. Thee! Ador. I stood the nearest to the throne In hierarchical degree, What time the Voice said Go! And whether I was moved alone By the storm-pathos of the tone Which swept through heaven the alien name of woe, Or whether the subtle glory broke Through my strong and shielding wings, Bearing to my finite essence Incapacious of their presence, Infinite imaginings, None knoweth save the Throned who spoke; But I who at creation stood upright And heard the God-breath move Shaping the words that lightened, “Be there light,” Nor trembled but with love, Now fell down shudderingly, My face upon the pavement whence I had towered, As if in mine immortal overpowered By God's eternity. Zerah. Let me wait!—Let me wait!— Ador. Nay, gaze not backward through the gate! God fills our heaven with God's own solitude Till all the pavements glow: His Godhead being no more subdued, By itself, to glories low Which seraphs can sustain. What if thou, in gazing so, Shouldst behold but only one Attribute, the veil undone— Even that to which we dare to press Nearest, for its gentleness— Ay, his love! How the deep ecstatic pain Thy being's strength would capture! Without language for the rapture, Without music strong to come And set the adoration free, For ever, ever, wouldst thou be Amid the general chorus dumb, God-stricken to seraphic agony. Or, brother, what if on thine eyes In vision bare should rise The life-fount whence his hand did gather With solitary force Our immortalities! Straightway how thine own would wither, Falter like a human breath, And shrink into a point like death, By gazing on its source!— My words have imaged dread. Meekly hast thou bent thine head, And dropt thy wings in languishment: Overclouding foot and face, As if God's throne were eminent Before thee, in the place. Yet not—not so, O loving spirit and meek, dost thou fulfil The supreme Will. Not for obeisance but obedience, Give motion to thy wings! Depart from hence! The voice said “Go!” Zerah. Beloved, I depart, His will is as a spirit within my spirit, A portion of the being I inherit. His will is mine obedience. I resemble A flame all undefilèd though it tremble; I go and tremble. Love me, O beloved! O thou, who stronger art, And standest ever near the Infinite, Pale with the light of Light, Love me, beloved! me, more newly made, More feeble, more afraid; And let me hear with mine thy pinions moved, As close and gentle as the loving are, That love being near, heaven may not seem so far. Ador. I am near thee and I love thee. Were I loveless, from thee gone, Love is round, beneath, above thee, God, the omnipresent one. Spread the wing and lift the brow Well-beloved, what fearest thou? Zerah. I fear, I fear— Ador. What fear? Zerah. The fear of earth. Ador. Of earth, the God-created and God-praised In the hour of birth? Where every night the moon in light Doth lead the waters silver-faced? Where every day the sun doth lay A rapture to the heart of all The leafy and reeded pastoral, As if the joyous shout which burst From angel lips to see him first, Had left a silent echo in his ray? Zerah. Of earth—the God-created and God-curst, Where man is, and the thorn Where sun and moon have borne No light to souls forlorn: Where Eden's tree of life no more uprears Its spiral leaves and fruitage, but instead The yew-tree bows its melancholy head And all the undergrasses kills and seres. Ador. Of earth the weak, Made and unmade? Where men, that faint, do strive for crowns that fade? Where, having won the profit which they seek, They lie beside the sceptre and the gold With fleshless hands that cannot wield or hold, And the stars shine in their unwinking eyes? Zerah. Of earth the bold, Where the blind matter wrings An awful potence out of impotence, Bowing the spiritual things To the things of sense. Where the human will replies With ay and no, Because the human pulse is quick or slow. Where Love succumbs to Change, With only his own memories, for revenge. And the fearful mystery— Ador. called Death? Zerah. Nay, death is fearful,—but who saith “To die,” is comprehensible. What's fearfuller, thou knowest well, Though the utterance be not for thee, Lest it blanch thy lips from glory— Ay! the cursed thing that moved A shadow of ill, long time ago, Across our heaven's own shining floor, And when it vanished, some who were On thrones of holy empire there, Did reign—were seen—were—never more. Come nearer, O beloved! Ador. I am near thee. Didst thou bear thee Ever to this earth? Zerah. Before. When thrilling from His hand along Its lustrous path with spheric song The earth was deathless, sorrowless. Unfearing, then, pure feet might press The grasses brightening with their feet, For God's own voice did mix its sound In a solemn confluence oft With the rivers' flowing round, And the life-tree's waving soft. Beautiful new earth and strange! Ador. Hast thou seen it since—the change? Zerah. Nay, or wherefore should I fear To look upon it now? I have beheld the ruined things Only in depicturings Of angels from an earthly mission,— Strong one, even upon thy brow, When, with task completed, given Back to us in that transition, I have beheld thee silent stand, Abstracted in the seraph band, Without a smile in heaven. Ador. Then thou wast not one of those Whom the loving Father chose In visionary pomp to sweep O'er Judæa's grassy places, O'er the shepherds and the sheep, Though thou art so tender?—dimming All the stars except one star With their brighter kinder faces, And using heaven's own tune in hymning, While deep response from earth's own mountains ran, “Peace upon earth, goodwill to man.” Zerah. “Glory to God.” I said amen afar. And those who from that earthly mission are, Within mine ears have told That the seven everlasting Spirits did hold With such a sweet and prodigal constraint The meaning yet the mystery of the song What time they sang it, on their natures strong, That, gazing down on earth's dark steadfastness And speaking the new peace in promises, The love and pity made their voices faint Into the low and tender music, keeping The place in heaven of what on earth is weeping. Ador. “Peace upon earth.” Come down to it. Zerah. Ah me! I hear thereof uncomprehendingly. Peace where the tempest, where the sighing is, And worship of the idol, 'stead of His? Ador. Yea, peace, where He is. Zerah. He! Say it again. Ador. Where He is. Zerah. Can it be That earth retains a tree Whose leaves, like Eden foliage, can be swayed By the breathing of His voice, nor shrink and fade? Ador. There is a tree!—it hath no leaf nor root; Upon it hangs a curse for all its fruit: Its shadow on his head is laid. For he, the crownèd Son, Has left his crown and throne, Walks earth in Adam's clay, Eve's snake to bruise and slay— Zerah. Walks earth in clay? Ador. And walking in the clay which he created, He through it shall touch death. What do I utter? what conceive? did breath Of demon howl it in a blasphemy? Or was it mine own voice, informed, dilated By the seven confluent Spirits?—Speak—answer me! Who said man's victim was his deity? Zerah. Beloved, beloved, the word came forth from thee. Thine eyes are rolling a tempestuous light Above, below, around, As putting thunder-questions without cloud, Reverberate without sound, To universal nature's depth and height. The tremor of an inexpressive thought Too self-amazed to shape itself aloud, O'erruns the awful curving of thy lips; And while thine hands are stretched above, As newly they had caught Some lightning from the Throne, or showed the Lord Some retributive sword, Thy brows do alternate with wild eclipse And radiance, with contrasted wrath and love, As God had called thee to a seraph's part, With a man's quailing heart. Ador. O heart—O heart of man! O ta'en from human clay To be no seraph's but Jehovah's own! Made holy in the taking, And yet unseparate From death's perpetual ban, And human feelings sad and passionate: Still subject to the treacherous forsaking Of other hearts, and its own steadfast pain. O heart of man—of God! which God has ta'en From out the dust, with its humanity Mournful and weak yet innocent around it, And bade its many pulses beating lie Beside that incommunicable stir Of Deity wherewith he interwound it. O man! and is thy nature so defiled That all that holy Heart's devout law-keeping, And low pathetic beat in deserts wild, And gushings pitiful of tender weeping For traitors who consigned it to such woe— That all could cleanse thee not, without the flow Of blood, the life-blood—His—and streaming so? O earth the thundercleft, windshaken, where The louder voice of “blood and blood” doth rise, Hast thou an altar for this sacrifice? O heaven! O vacant throne! O crownèd hierarchies that wear your crown When His is put away! Are ye unshamèd that ye cannot dim Your alien brightness to be liker him, Assume a human passion, and down-lay Your sweet secureness for congenial fears, And teach your cloudless ever-burning eyes The mystery of his tears? Zerah. I am strong, I am strong. Were I never to see my heaven again, I would wheel to earth like the tempest rain Which sweeps there with an exultant sound To lose its life as it reaches the ground. I am strong, I am strong. Away from mine inward vision swim The shining seats of my heavenly birth, I see but his, I see but him— The Maker's steps on his cruel earth. Will the bitter herbs of earth grow sweet To me, as trodden by his feet? Will the vexed, accurst humanity, As worn by him, begin to be A blessed, yea, a sacred thing For love and awe and ministering? I am strong, I am strong. By our angel ken shall we survey His loving smile through his woeful clay? I am swift, I am strong, The love is bearing me along. Ador. One love is bearing us along. PART THE SECOND. Mid-air, above Judæa. Ador and Zerah are a little apart from the visible Angelic Hosts. Ador. Beloved! dost thou see?— Zerah. Thee,—thee. Thy burning eyes already are Grown wild and mournful as a star Whose occupation is for aye To look upon the place of clay Whereon thou lookest now. The crown is fainting on thy brow To the likeness of a cloud, The forehead's self a little bowed From its aspect high and holy, As it would in meekness meet Some seraphic melancholy: Thy very wings that lately flung An outline clear, do flicker here And wear to each a shadow hung, Dropped across thy feet. In these strange contrasting glooms Stagnant with the scent of tombs, Seraph faces, O my brother, Show awfully to one another. Ador. Dost thou see? Zerah. Even so; I see Our empyreal company, Alone the memory of their brightness Left in them, as in thee. The circle upon circle, tier on tier, Piling earth's hemisphere With heavenly infiniteness, Above us and around, Straining the whole horizon like a bow: Their songful lips divorcèd from all sound, A darkness gliding down their silvery glances,— Bowing their steadfast solemn countenances As if they heard God speak, and could not glow. Ador. Look downward! dost thou see? Zerah. And wouldst thou press that vision on my words? Doth not earth speak enough Of change and of undoing, Without a seraph's witness? Oceans rough With tempest, pastoral swards Displaced by fiery deserts, mountains ruing The bolt fallen yesterday, That shake their piny heads, as who would say “We are too beautiful for our decay”— Shall seraphs speak of these things? Let alone Earth to her earthly moan! Voice of all things. Is there no moan but hers? Ador. Hearest thou the attestation Of the rousèd universe Like a desert-lion shaking Dews of silence from its mane? With an irrepressive passion Uprising at once, Rising up and forsaking Its solemn state in the circle of suns, To attest the pain Of him who stands (O patience sweet!) In his own hand-prints of creation, With human feet? Voice of all things. Is there no moan but ours? Zerah. Forms, Spaces, Motions wide, O meek, insensate things, O congregated matters! who inherit, Instead of vital powers, Impulsions God-supplied; Instead of influent spirit, A clear informing beauty; Instead of creature-duty, Submission calm as rest. Lights, without feet or wings, In golden courses sliding! Glooms, stagnantly subsiding, Whose lustrous heart away was prest Into the argent stars! Ye crystal firmamental bars That hold the skyey waters free From tide or tempest's ecstasy! Airs universal! thunders lorn That wait your lightnings in cloud-cave Hewn out by the winds! O brave And subtle elements! the Holy Hath charged me by your voice with folly. “His angels he charged with folly.” —Job iv. 18. Enough, the mystic arrow leaves its wound. Return ye to your silences inborn, Or to your inarticulated sound! Ador. Zerah! Zerah. Wilt thou rebuke? God hath rebuked me, brother. I am weak. Ador. Zerah, my brother Zerah! could I speak Of thee, 'twould be of love to thee. Zerah. Thy look Is fixed on earth, as mine upon thy face. Where shall I seek His? I have thrown One look upon earth, but one, Over the blue mountain-lines, Over the forests of palms and pines, Over the harvest-lands golden, Over the valleys that fold in The gardens and vines— He is not there. All these are unworthy Those footsteps to bear, Before which, bowing down I would fain quench the stars of my crown In the dark of the earthy. Where shall I seek him? No reply? Hath language left thy lips, to place Its vocal in thine eye? Ador, Ador! are we come To a double portent, that Dumb matter grows articulate And songful seraphs dumb? Ador, Ador! Ador. I constrain The passion of my silence. None Of those places gazed upon Are gloomy enow to fit his pain. Unto Him, whose forming word Gave to Nature flower and sward, She hath given back again, For the myrtle—the thorn, For the sylvan calm—the human scorn. Still, still, reluctant seraph, gaze beneath! There is a city— Zerah. Temple and tower, Palace and purple would droop like a flower, (Or a cloud at our breath) If He neared in his state The outermost gate. Ador. Ah me, not so In the state of a king did the victim go! And Thou who hangest mute of speech 'Twixt heaven and earth, with forehead yet Stainèd by the bloody sweat, God! man! Thou hast forgone thy throne in each. Zerah. Thine eyes behold him? Ador. Yea, below. Track the gazing of mine eyes, Naming God within thine heart That its weakness may depart And the vision rise! Seest thou yet, beloved? Zerah. I see Beyond the city, crosses three And mortals three that hang thereon 'Ghast and silent to the sun. Round them blacken and welter and press Staring multitudes whose father Adam was, whose brows are dark With his Cain's corroded mark,— Who curse with looks. Nay—let me rather Turn unto the wilderness! Ador. Turn not! God dwells with men. Zerah. Above He dwells with angels, and they love. Can these love? With the living's pride They stare at those who die, who hang In their sight and die. They bear the streak Of the crosses' shadow, black not wide, To fall on their heads, as it swerves aside When the victims' pang Makes the dry wood creak. Ador. The cross—the cross! Zerah. A woman kneels The mid cross under, With white lips asunder, And motion on each. They throb, as she feels, With a spasm, not a speech; And her lids, close as sleep, Are less calm, for the eyes Have made room there to weep Drop on drop— Ador. Weep? Weep blood, All women, all men! He sweated it, He, For your pale womanhood And base manhood. Agree That these water-tears, then, Are vain, mocking like laughter: Weep blood! Shall the flood Of salt curses, whose foam is the darkness, on roll Forward, on from the strand of the storm-beaten years, And back from the rocks of the horrid hereafter, And up, in a coil, from the present's wrath-spring, Yea, down from the windows of heaven opening, Deep calling to deep as they meet on His soul— And men weep only tears? Zerah. Little drops in the lapse! And yet, Ador, perhaps It is all that they can. Tears! the lovingest man Has no better bestowed Upon man. Ador. Nor on God. Zerah. Do all-givers need gifts? If the Giver said “Give,” the first motion would slay Our Immortals, the echo would ruin away The same worlds which he made. Why, what angel uplifts Such a music, so clear, It may seem in God's ear Worth more than a woman's hoarse weeping? And thus, Pity tender as tears, I above thee would speak, Thou woman that weepest! weep unscorned of us! I, the tearless and pure, am but loving and weak. Ador. Speak low, my brother, low,—and not of love Or human or angelic! Rather stand Before the throne of that Supreme above, In whose infinitude the secrecies Of thine own being lie hid, and lift thine hand Exultant, saying, “Lord God, I am wise!”— Than utter here, “I love.” Zerah. And yet thine eyes Do utter it. They melt in tender light, The tears of heaven. Ador. Of heaven. Ah me! Zerah. Ador! Ador. Say on! Zerah. The crucified are three. Beloved, they are unlike. Ador. Unlike. Zerah. For one Is as a man who has sinned and still Doth wear the wicked will, The hard malign life-energy, Tossed outward, in the parting soul's disdain, On brow and lip that cannot change again. Ador. And one— Zerah. Has also sinned. And yet (O marvel!) doth the Spirit-wind Blow white those waters? Death upon his face Is rather shine than shade, A tender shine by looks belovèd made: He seemeth dying in a quiet place, And less by iron wounds in hands and feet Than heart-broke by new joy too sudden and sweet. Ador. And one!— Zerah. And one!— Ador. Why dost thou pause? Zerah. God! God! Spirit of my spirit! who movest Through seraph veins in burning deity To light the quenchless pulses!— Ador. But hast trod The depths of love in thy peculiar nature, And not in any thou hast made and lovest In narrow seraph hearts!— Zerah. Above, Creator! Within, Upholder! Ador. And below, below, The creature's and the upholden's sacrifice! Zerah. Why do I pause?— Ador. There is a silentness That answers thee enow, That, like a brazen sound Excluding others, doth ensheathe us round,— Hear it. It is not from the visible skies Though they are still, Unconscious that their own dropped dews express The light of heaven on every earthly hill. It is not from the hills, though calm and bare They, since their first creation, Through midnight cloud or morning's glittering air Or the deep deluge blindness, toward the place Whence thrilled the mystic word's creative grace, And whence again shall come The word that uncreates, Have lift their brows in voiceless expectation. It is not from the places that entomb Man's dead, though common Silence there dilates Her soul to grand proportions, worthily To fill life's vacant room. Not there: not there. Not yet within those chambers lieth He, A dead one in his living world; his south And west winds blowing over earth and sea, And not a breath on that creating mouth. But now,—a silence keeps (Not death's, nor sleep's) The lips whose whispered word Might roll the thunders round reverberated. Silent art thou, O my Lord, Bowing down thy stricken head! Fearest thou, a groan of thine Would make the pulse of thy creation fail As thine own pulse?—would rend the veil Of visible things and let the flood Of the unseen Light, the essential God, Rush in to whelm the undivine? Thy silence, to my thinking, is as dread. Zerah. O silence! Ador. Doth it say to thee—the name, Slow-learning seraph? Zerah. I have learnt. Ador. The flame Perishes in thine eyes. Zerah. He opened his, And looked. I cannot bear— Ador. Their agony? Zerah. Their love. God's depth is in them. From his brows White, terrible in meekness, didst thou see The lifted eyes unclose? He is God, seraph! Look no more on me, O God—I am not God. Ador. The loving is Sublimed within them by the sorrowful. In heaven we could sustain them. Zerah. Heaven is dull, Mine Ador, to man's earth. The light that burns In fluent, refluent motion Along the crystal ocean; The springing of the golden harps between The bowery wings, in fountains of sweet sound, The winding, wandering music that returns Upon itself, exultingly self-bound In the great spheric round Of everlasting praises; The God-thoughts in our midst that intervene, Visibly flashing from the súpreme throne Full in seraphic faces Till each astonishes the other, grown More beautiful with worship and delight— My heaven! my home of heaven! my infinite Heaven-choirs! what are ye to this dust and death, This cloud, this cold, these tears, this failing breath, Where God's immortal love now issueth In this man's woe? Ador. His eyes are very deep yet calm. Zerah. No more On me, Jehovah-man— Ador. Calm-deep. They show A passion which is tranquil. They are seeing No earth, no heaven, no men that slay and curse, No seraphs that adore; Their gaze is on the invisible, the dread, The things we cannot view or think or speak, Because we are too happy, or too weak,— The sea of ill, for which the universe, With all its pilèd space, can find no shore, With all its life, no living foot to tread. But he, accomplished in Jehovah-being, Sustains the gaze adown, Conceives the vast despair, And feels the billowy griefs come up to drown, Nor fears, nor faints, nor fails, till all be finished. Zerah. Thus, do I find Thee thus? My undiminished And undiminishable God!—my God! The echoes are still tremulous along The heavenly mountains, of the latest song Thy manifested glory swept abroad In rushing past our lips: they echo aye “Creator, thou art strong! Creator, thou art blessèd over all.” By what new utterance shall I now recall, Unteaching the heaven-echoes? Dare I say, “Creator, thou art feebler than thy work! Creator, thou art sadder than thy creature! A worm, and not a man, Yea, no worm, but a curse?” I dare not so mine heavenly phrase reverse. Albeit the piercing thorn and thistle-fork (Whose seed disordered ran From Eve's hand trembling when the curse did reach her) Be garnered darklier in thy soul, the rod That smites thee never blossoming, and thou Grief-bearer for thy world, with unkinged brow— I leave to men their song of Ichabod: I have an angel-tongue—I know but praise. Ador. Hereafter shall the blood-bought captives raise The passion-song of blood. Zerah. And we, extend Our holy vacant hands towards the Throne, Crying “We have no music.” Ador. Rather, blend Both musics into one. The sanctities and sanctified above Shall each to each, with lifted looks serene, Their shining faces lean, And mix the adoring breath And breathe the full thanksgiving. Zerah. But the love— The love, mine Ador! Ador. Do we love not? Zerah. Yea, But not as man shall! not with life for death, New-throbbing through the startled being; not With strange astonished smiles, that ever may Gush passionate like tears and fill their place: Nor yet with speechless memories of what Earth's winters were, enverduring the green Of every heavenly palm Whose windless, shadeless calm Moves only at the breath of the Unseen. Oh, not with this blood on us—and this face,— Still, haply, pale with sorrow that it bore In our behalf, and tender evermore With nature all our own, upon us gazing— Nor yet with these forgiving hands upraising Their unreproachful wounds, alone to bless! Alas, Creator! shall we love thee less Than mortals shall? Ador. Amen! so let it be. We love in our proportion, to the bound Thine infinite our finite set around, And that is finitely,—thou, infinite And worthy infinite love! And our delight Is, watching the dear love poured out to thee From ever fuller chalice. Blessèd they, Who love thee more than we do: blessèd we, Viewing that love which shall exceed even this, And winning in the sight a double bliss For all so lost in love's supremacy. The bliss is better. Only on the sad Cold earth there are who say It seemeth better to be great than glad. The bliss is better. Love him more, O man, Than sinless seraphs can! Zerah. Yea, love him more! Voices of the Angelic Multitude. Yea, more! Ador. The loving word Is caught by those from whom we stand apart. For silence hath no deepness in her heart Where love's low name low breathed would not be heard By angels, clear as thunder. Angelic Voices. Love him more! Ador. Sweet voices, swooning o'er The music which ye make! Albeit to love there were not ever given A mournful sound when uttered out of heaven, That angel-sadness ye would fitly take. Of love be silent now! we gaze adown Upon the incarnate Love who wears no crown. Zerah. No crown! the woe instead Is heavy on his head, Pressing inward on his brain With a hot and clinging pain Till all tears are prest away, And clear and calm his vision may Peruse the black abyss. No rod, no sceptre is Holden in his fingers pale; They close instead upon the nail, Concealing the sharp dole, Never stirring to put by The fair hair peaked with blood, Drooping forward from the rood Helplessly, heavily On the cheek that waxeth colder, Whiter ever, and the shoulder Where the government was laid. His glory made the heavens afraid; Will he not unearth this cross from its hole? His pity makes his piteous state; Will he be uncompassionate Alone to his proper soul? Yea, will he not lift up His lips from the bitter cup, His brows from the dreary weight, His hand from the clenching cross, Crying, “My Father, give to me Again the joy I had with thee Or ere this earth was made for loss?” No stir: no sound. The love and woe being interwound He cleaveth to the woe; And putteth forth heaven's strength below, To bear. Ador. And that creates his anguish now, Which made his glory there. Zerah. Shall it need be so? Awake, thou Earth! behold. Thou, uttered forth of old In all thy life-emotion, In all thy vernal noises, In the rollings of thine ocean, Leaping founts, and rivers running,— In thy woods' prophetic heaving Ere the rains a stroke have given, In thy winds' exultant voices When they feel the hills anear,— In the firmamental sunning, And the tempest which rejoices Thy full heart with an awful cheer. Thou, uttered forth of old And with all thy music rolled In a breath abroad By the breathing God,— Awake! He is here! behold! Even thou— beseems it good To thy vacant vision dim, That the deadly ruin should, For thy sake, encompass him? That the Master-word should lie A mere silence, while his own Processive harmony, The faintest echo of his lightest tone, Is sweeping in a choral triumph by? Awake! emit a cry! And say, albeit used From Adam's ancient years To falls of acrid tears, To frequent sighs unloosed, Caught back to press again On bosoms zoned with pain— To corses still and sullen The shine and music dulling With closèd eyes and ears That nothing sweet can enter, Commoving thee no less With that forced quietness Than the earthquake in thy centre— Thou hast not learnt to bear This new divine despair! These tears that sink into thee, These dying eyes that view thee, This dropping blood from lifted rood, They darken and undo thee. Thou canst not presently sustain this corse— Cry, cry, thou hast not force! Cry, thou wouldst fainer keep Thy hopeless charnels deep, Thyself a general tomb Where the first and the second Death Sit gazing face to face And mar each other's breath, While silent bones through all the place 'Neath sun and moon do faintly glisten And seem to lie and listen For the tramp of the coming Doom. Is it not meet That they who erst the Eden fruit did eat, Should champ the ashes? That they who wrap them in the thunder-cloud Should wear it as a shroud, Perishing by its flashes? That they who vexed the lion should be rent? Cry, cry “I will sustain my punishment, The sin being mine; but take away from me This visioned Dread—this man—this Deity!” The Earth. I have groaned; I have travailed: I am weary. I am blind with my own grief, and cannot see, As clear-eyed angels can, his agony, And what I see I also can sustain, Because his power protects me from his pain. I have groaned; I have travailed: I am dreary, Hearkening the thick sobs of my children's heart: How can I say “Depart” To that Atoner making calm and free? Am I a God as he, To lay down peace and power as willingly? Ador. He looked for some to pity. There is none. All pity is within him and not for him. His earth is iron under him, and o'er him His skies are brass. His seraphs cry “Alas!” With hallelujah voice that cannot weep. And man, for whom the dreadful work is done . . . Scornful Voices from the Earth. If verily this be the Eternal's son— Ador. Thou hearest. Man is grateful. Zerah. Can I hear Nor darken into man and cease for ever My seraph-smile to wear? Was it for such, It pleased him to overleap His glory with his love and sever From the God-light and the throne And all angels bowing down, For whom his every look did touch New notes of joy on the unworn string Of an eternal worshipping? For such, he left his heaven? There, though never bought by blood And tears, we gave him gratitude: We loved him there, though unforgiven. Ador. The light is riven Above, around, And down in lurid fragments flung, That catch the mountain-peak and stream With momentary gleam, Then perish in the water and the ground. River and waterfall, Forest and wilderness, Mountain and city, are together wrung Into one shape, and that is shapelessness; The darkness stands for all. Zerah. The pathos hath the day undone: The death-look of His eyes Hath overcome the sun And made it sicken in its narrow skies. Ador. Is it to death? He dieth. Zerah. Through the dark He still, he only, is discernible— The naked hands and feet transfixèd stark, The countenance of patient anguish white, Do make themselves a light More dreadful than the glooms which round them dwell, And therein do they shine. Ador. God! Father-God! Perpetual Radiance on the radiant throne! Uplift the lids of inward deity, Flashing abroad Thy burning Infinite! Light up this dark where there is nought to see Except the unimagined agony Upon the sinless forehead of the Son! Zerah. God, tarry not! Behold, enow Hath he wandered as a stranger, Sorrowed as a victim. Thou Appear for him, O Father! Appear for him, Avenger! Appear for him, just One and holy One, For he is holy and just! At once the darkness and dishonour rather To the ragged jaws of hungry chaos rake, And hurl aback to ancient dust These mortals that make blasphemies With their made breath, this earth and skies That only grow a little dim, Seeing their curse on him. But him, of all forsaken, Of creature and of brother, Never wilt thou forsake! Thy living and thy loving cannot slacken Their firm essential hold upon each other, And well thou dost remember how his part Was still to lie upon thy breast and be Partaker of the light that dwelt in thee Ere sun or seraph shone; And how while silence trembled round the throne Thou countedst by the beatings of his heart The moments of thine own eternity. Awaken, O right hand with the lightnings! Again gather His glory to thy glory! What estranger, What ill supreme in evil, can be thrust Between the faithful Father and the Son? Appear for him, O Father! Appear for him, Avenger! Appear for him, just One and holy One, For he is holy and just! Ador. Thy face upturned toward the throne is dark; Thou hast no answer, Zerah. Zerah. No reply, O unforsaking Father? Ador. Hark! Instead of downward voice, a cry Is uttered from beneath. Zerah. And by a sharper sound than death, Mine immortality is riven. The heavy darkness which doth tent the sky Floats backward as by a sudden wind: But I see no light behind, But I feel the farthest stars are all Stricken and shaken, And I know a shadow sad and broad Doth fall—doth fall On our vacant thrones in heaven. Voice from the Cross. My God, my God, Why hast Thou me forsaken? The Earth. Ah me, ah me, ah me! the dreadful Why! My sin is on thee, sinless one! Thou art God-orphaned, for my burden on thy head. Dark sin, white innocence, endurance dread! Be still, within your shrouds, my buried dead; Nor work with this quick horror round mine heart. Zerah. He hath forsaken him. I perish. Ador. Hold Upon his name! we perish not. Of old His will— Zerah. I seek his will. Seek, seraphim! My God, my God! where is it? Doth that curse Reverberate spare us, seraph or universe? He hath forsaken him. Ador. He cannot fail. Angel Voices. We faint, we droop, Our love doth tremble like fear. Voices of Fallen Angels from the Earth. Do we prevail? Or are we lost? Hath not the ill we did Been heretofore our good? Is it not ill that one, all sinless, should Hang heavy with all curses on a cross? Nathless, that cry! With huddled faces hid Within the empty graves which men did scoop To hold more damnèd dead, we shudder through What shall exalt us or undo, Our triumph, or our loss. Voice from the Cross. It is finished. Zerah. Hark, again! Like a victor, speaks the slain. Angel Voices. Finished be the trembling vain! Ador. Upward, like a well-loved son, Looketh he, the orphaned one. Angel Voices. Finished is the mystic pain. Voices of Fallen Angels. His deathly forehead at the word, Gleameth like a seraph sword. Angel Voices. Finished is the demon reign. Ador. His breath, as living God, createth, His breath, as dying man, completeth. Angel Voices. Finished work his hands sustain. The Earth. In mine ancient sepulchres Where my kings and prophets freeze, Adam dead four thousand years, Unwakened by the universe's Everlasting moan, Aye his ghastly silence mocking— Unwakened by his children's knocking At his old sepulchral stone, “Adam, Adam, all this curse is Thine and on us yet!”— Unwakened by the ceaseless tears Wherewith they made his cerement wet, “Adam, must thy curse remain?”— Starts with sudden life and hears Through the slow dripping of the caverned eaves,— Angel Voices. Finished is his bane. Voice from the Cross. Father! my spirit to thine hands is given. Ador. Hear the wailing winds that be By wings of unclean spirits made! They, in that last look, surveyed The love they lost in losing heaven, And passionately flee With a desolate cry that cleaves The natural storms—though they are lifting God's strong cedar-roots like leaves, And the earthquake and the thunder, Neither keeping either under, Roar and hurtle through the glooms— And a few pale stars are drifting Past the dark, to disappear, What time, from the splitting tombs Gleamingly the dead arise, Viewing with their death-calmed eyes The elemental strategies, To witness, victory is the Lord's. Hear the wail o' the spirits! hear! Zerah. I hear alone the memory of his words. EPILOGUE. I. My song is done. My voice that long hath faltered shall be still. The mystic darkness drops from Calvary's hill Into the common light of this day's sun. II. I see no more thy cross, O holy Slain! I hear no more the horror and the coil Of the great world's turmoil Feeling thy countenance too still,—nor yell Of demons sweeping past it to their prison. The skies that turned to darkness with thy pain Make now a summer's day; And on my changèd ear that sabbath bell Records how Christ is risen. III. And I—ah! what am I To counterfeit, with faculty earth-darkened, Seraphic brows of light And seraph language never used nor hearkened? Ah me! what word that seraphs say, could come From mouth so used to sighs, so soon to lie Sighless, because then breathless, in the tomb? IV. Bright ministers of God and grace—of grace Because of God! whether ye bow adown In your own heaven, before the living face Of him who died and deathless wears the crown, Or whether at this hour ye haply are Anear, around me, hiding in the night Of this permitted ignorance your light, This feebleness to spare,— Forgive me, that mine earthly heart should dare Shape images of unincarnate spirits And lay upon their burning lips a thought Cold with the weeping which mine earth inherits. And though ye find in such hoarse music, wrought To copy yours, a cadence all the while Of sin and sorrow—only pitying smile! Ye know to pity, well. V. I too may haply smile another day At the far recollection of this lay, When God may call me in your midst to dwell, To hear your most sweet music's miracle And see your wondrous faces. May it be! For his remembered sake, the Slain on rood, Who rolled his earthly garment red in blood (Treading the wine-press) that the weak, like me, Before his heavenly throne should walk in white. THE POET'S VOW. “O be wiser thou, Instructed that true knowledge leads to love.” —Wordsworth. PART THE FIRST. SHOWING WHEREFORE THE VOW WAS MADE. I Eve is a twofold mystery; The stillness Earth doth keep, The motion wherewith human hearts Do each to either leap As if all souls between the poles Felt “Parting comes in sleep.” II The rowers lift their oars to view Each other in the sea; The landsmen watch the rocking boats In a pleasant company; While up the hill go gladlier still Dear friends by two and three. III The peasant's wife hath looked without Her cottage door and smiled, For there the peasant drops his spade To clasp his youngest child Which hath no speech, but its hand can reach And stroke his forehead mild. IV A poet sate that eventide Within his hall alone, As silent as its ancient lords In the coffined place of stone, When the bat hath shrunk from the praying monk, And the praying monk is gone. V Nor wore the dead a stiller face Beneath the cerement's roll: His lips refusing out in words Their mystic thoughts to dole, His steadfast eye burnt inwardly, As burning out his soul. VI You would not think that brow could e'er Ungentle moods express, Yet seemed it, in this troubled world, Too calm for gentleness, When the very star that shines from far Shines trembling ne'ertheless. VII It lacked, all need, the softening light Which other brows supply: We should conjoin the scathèd trunks Of our humanity, That each leafless spray entwining may Look softer 'gainst the sky. VIII None gazed within the poet's face, The poet gazed in none; He threw a lonely shadow straight Before the moon and sun, Affronting nature's heaven-dwelling creatures With wrong to nature done: IX Because this poet daringly, —The nature at his heart, And that quick tune along his veins He could not change by art,— Had vowed his blood of brotherhood To a stagnant place apart. X He did not vow in fear, or wrath, Or grief's fantastic whim, But, weights and shows of sensual things Too closely crossing him, On his soul's eyelid the pressure slid And made its vision dim. XI And darkening in the dark he strove 'Twixt earth and sea and sky To lose in shadow, wave and cloud, His brother's haunting cry: The winds were welcome as they swept, God's five-day work he would accept, But let the rest go by. XII He cried, “O touching, patient Earth That weepest in thy glee, Whom God created very good, And very mournful, we! Thy voice of moan doth reach His throne, As Abel's rose from thee. XIII “Poor crystal sky with stars astray! Mad winds that howling go From east to west! perplexèd seas That stagger from their blow! O motion wild! O wave defiled! Our curse hath made you so. XIV “We! and our curse! do I partake The desiccating sin? Have I the apple at my lips? The money-lust within? Do I human stand with the wounding hand, To the blasting heart akin? XV “Thou solemn pathos of all things For solemn joy designed! Behold, submissive to your cause, A holy wrath I find, And, for your sake, the bondage break That knits me to my kind. XVI “Hear me forswear man's sympathies, His pleasant yea and no, His riot on the piteous earth Whereon his thistles grow, His changing love—with stars above, His pride—with graves below. XVII “Hear me forswear his roof by night, His bread and salt by day, His talkings at the wood-fire hearth, His greetings by the way, His answering looks, his systemed books, All man, for aye and aye. XVIII “That so my purged, once human heart, From all the human rent, May gather strength to pledge and drink Your wine of wonderment, While you pardon me all blessingly The woe mine Adam sent. XIX “And I shall feel your unseen looks Innumerous, constant, deep And soft as haunted Adam once, Though sadder, round me creep,— As slumbering men have mystic ken Of watchers on their sleep. XX “And ever, when I lift my brow At evening to the sun, No voice of woman or of child Recording ‘Day is done.’ Your silences shall a love express, More deep than such an one.” PART THE SECOND. SHOWING TO WHOM THE VOW WAS DECLARED. I. The poet's vow was inly sworn, The poet's vow was told. He shared among his crowding friends The silver and the gold, They clasping bland his gift,—his hand In a somewhat slacker hold. II. They wended forth, the crowding friends, With farewells smooth and kind. They wended forth, the solaced friends, And left but twain behind: One loved him true as brothers do, And one was Rosalind. III. He said, “My friends have wended forth With farewells smooth and kind; Mine oldest friend, my plighted bride, Ye need not stay behind: Friend, wed my fair bride for my sake, And let my lands ancestral make A dower for Rosalind. IV. ‘And when beside your wassail board Ye bless your social lot, I charge you that the giver be In all his gifts forgot, Or alone of all his words recall The last,—Lament me not.” V. She looked upon him silently With her large, doubting eyes, Like a child that never knew but love Whom words of wrath surprise, Till the rose did break from either cheek And the sudden tears did rise. VI. She looked upon him mournfully, While her large eyes were grown Yet larger with the steady tears, Till, all his purpose known, She turnèd slow, as she would go— The tears were shaken down. VII. She turnèd slow, as she would go, Then quickly turned again, And gazing in his face to seek Some little touch of pain, “I thought,” she said,—but shook her head,— She tried that speech in vain. VIII. “I thought—but I am half a child And very sage art thou— The teachings of the heaven and earth Should keep us soft and low: They have drawn my tears in early years, Or ere I wept—as now. IX. “But now that in thy face I read Their cruel homily, Before their beauty I would fain Untouched, unsoftened be,— If I indeed could look on even The senseless, loveless earth and heaven As thou canst look on me! X. “And couldest thou as coldly view Thy childhood's far abode, Where little feet kept time with thine Along the dewy sod, And thy mother's look from holy book Rose like a thought of God? XI. “O brother,—called so, ere her last Betrothing words were said! O fellow-watcher in her room, With hushèd voice and tread! Rememberest thou how, hand in hand O friend, O lover, we did stand, And knew that she was dead? XII. “I will not live Sir Roland's bride, That dower I will not hold; I tread below my feet that go, These parchments bought and sold: The tears I weep are mine to keep, And worthier than thy gold.” XIII. The poet and Sir Roland stood Alone, each turned to each, Till Roland brake the silence left By that soft-throbbing speech— “Poor heart!” he cried, “it vainly tried The distant heart to reach. XIV. “And thou, O distant, sinful heart That climbest up so high To wrap and blind thee with the snows That cause to dream and die, What blessing can, from lips of man, Approach thee with his sigh? XV. “Ay, what from earth—create for man And moaning in his moan? Ay, what from stars—revealed to man And man-named one by one? Ay, more! what blessing can be given Where the Spirits seven do show in heaven A Man upon the throne? XVI. “A man on earth He wandered once, All meek and undefiled, And those who loved Him said ‘He wept’— None ever said He smiled; Yet there might have been a smile unseen, When He bowed His holy face, I ween, To bless that happy child. XVII. “And now He pleadeth up in heaven For our humanities, Till the ruddy light on seraphs' wings In pale emotion dies. They can better bear their Godhead's glare Than the pathos of His eyes. XVIII. “I will go pray our God to-day To teach thee how to scan His work divine, for human use Since earth on axle ran,— To teach thee to discern as plain His grief divine, the blood-drop's stain He left there, Man for man. XIX. “So, for the blood's sake shed by Him Whom angels God declare, Tears like it, moist and warm with love, Thy reverent eyes shall wear To see i' the face of Adam's race The nature God doth share.” XX. “I heard,” the poet said, “thy voice As dimly as thy breath: The sound was like the noise of life To one anear his death,— Or of waves that fail to stir the pale Sere leaf they roll beneath. XXI. “And still between the sound and me White creatures like a mist Did interfloat confusedly, Mysterious shapes unwist: Across my heart and across my brow I felt them droop like wreaths of snow, To still the pulse they kist. XXII. “The castle and its lands are thine— The poor's—it shall be done. Go, man, to love! I go to live In Courland hall, alone: The bats along the ceilings cling, The lizards in the floors do run, And storms and years have worn and reft The stain by human builders left In working at the stone.” PART THE THIRD. SHOWING HOW THE VOW WAS KEPT. I. He dwelt alone, and sun and moon Were witness that he made Rejection of his humanness Until they seemed to fade; His face did so, for he did grow Of his own soul afraid. II. The self-poised God may dwell alone With inward glorying, But God's chief angel waiteth for A brother's voice, to sing; And a lonely creature of sinful nature It is an awful thing. III. An awful thing that feared itself; While many years did roll, A lonely man, a feeble man, A part beneath the whole, He bore by day, he bore by night That pressure of God's infinite Upon his finite soul. IV. The poet at his lattice sate, And downward lookèd he. Three Christians wended by to prayers, With mute ones in their ee; Each turned above a face of love And called him to the far chapelle With voice more tuneful than its bell: But still they wended three. V. There journeyed by a bridal pomp, A bridegroom and his dame; He speaketh low for happiness, She blusheth red for shame: But never a tone of benison From out the lattice came. VI. A little child with inward song, No louder noise to dare, Stood near the wall to see at play The lizards green and rare— Unblessed the while for his childish smile Which cometh unaware. PART THE FOURTH. SHOWING HOW ROSALIND FARED BY THE KEEPING OF THE VOW. I. In death-sheets lieth Rosalind As white and still as they; And the old nurse that watched her bed Rose up with “Well-a-day!” And oped the casement to let in The sun, and that sweet doubtful din Which droppeth from the grass and bough Sans wind and bird, none knoweth how— To cheer her as she lay. II. The old nurse started when she saw Her sudden look of woe: But the quick wan tremblings round her mouth In a meek smile did go, And calm she said, “When I am dead, Dear nurse, it shall be so. III. “Till then, shut out those sights and sounds, And pray God pardon me That I without this pain no more His blessèd works can see! And lean beside me, loving nurse, That thou mayst hear, ere I am worse, What thy last love should be.” IV. The loving nurse leant over her, As white she lay beneath; The old eyes searching, dim with life, The young ones dim with death, To read their look if sound forsook The trying, trembling breath. V. “When all this feeble breath is done, And I on bier am laid, My tresses smoothed for never a feast, My body in shroud arrayed, Uplift each palm in a saintly calm, As if that still I prayed. VI. “And heap beneath mine head the flowers You stoop so low to pull, The little white flowers from the wood Which grow there in the cool, Which he and I, in childhood's games, Went plucking, knowing not their names, And filled thine apron full. VII. “Weep not! I weep not. Death is strong, The eyes of Death are dry! But lay this scroll upon my breast When hushed its heavings lie, And wait awhile for the corpse's smile Which shineth presently. VIII. “And when it shineth, straightway call Thy youngest children dear, And bid them gently carry me All barefaced on the bier; But bid them pass my kirkyard grass That waveth long anear. IX. “And up the bank where I used to sit And dream what life would be, Along the brook with its sunny look Akin to living glee,— O'er the windy hill, through the forest still, Let them gently carry me. X. “And through the piny forest still, And down the open moorland Round where the sea beats mistily And blindly on the foreland; And let them chant that hymn I know, Bearing me soft, bearing me slow, To the ancient hall of Courland. XI. “And when withal they near the hall, In silence let them lay My bier before the bolted door, And leave it for a day: For I have vowed, though I am proud, To go there as a guest in shroud, And not be turned away.” XII. The old nurse looked within her eyes Whose mutual look was gone; The old nurse stooped upon her mouth, Whose answering voice was done; And nought she heard, till a little bird Upon the casement's woodbine swinging Broke out into a loud sweet singing For joy o' the summer sun: “Alack! alack!”—she watched no more, With head on knee she wailèd sore, And the little bird sang o'er and o'er For joy o' the summer sun. PART THE FIFTH. SHOWING HOW THE VOW WAS BROKEN. I. The poet oped his bolted door The midnight sky to view; A spirit-feel was in the air Which seemed to touch his spirit bare Whenever his breath he drew; And the stars a liquid softness had, As alone their holiness forbade Their falling with the dew. II. They shine upon the steadfast hills, Upon the swinging tide, Upon the narrow track of beach And the murmuring pebbles pied: They shine on every lovely place, They shine upon the corpse's face, As it were fair beside. III. It lay before him, humanlike, Yet so unlike a thing! More awful in its shrouded pomp Than any crownèd king: All calm and cold, as it did hold Some secret, glorying. IV. A heavier weight than of its clay Clung to his heart and knee: As if those folded palms could strike He staggered groaningly, And then o'erhung, without a groan, The meek close mouth that smiled alone, Whose speech the scroll must be. THE WORDS OF ROSALIND'S SCROLL. “I left thee last, a child at heart, A woman scarce in years. I come to thee, a solemn corpse Which neither feels nor fears. I have no breath to use in sighs; They laid the dead-weights on mine eyes To seal them safe from tears. “Look on me with thine own calm look: I meet it calm as thou. No look of thine can change this smile, Or break thy sinful vow: I tell thee that my poor scorned heart Is of thine earth—thine earth, a part: It cannot vex thee now. “But out, alas! these words are writ By a living, loving one, Adown whose cheeks, the proofs of life The warm quick tears do run: Ah, let the unloving corpse control Thy scorn back from the loving soul Whose place of rest is won. “I have prayed for thee with bursting sob When passion's course was free; I have prayed for thee with silent lips, In the anguish none could see: They whispered oft, ‘She sleepeth soft’— But I only prayed for thee. “Go to! I pray for thee no more: The corpse's tongue is still, Its folded fingers point to heaven, But point there stiff and chill: No farther wrong, no farther woe Hath license from the sin below Its tranquil heart to thrill. “I charge thee, by the living's prayer, And the dead's silentness, To wring from out thy soul a cry Which God shall hear and bless! Lest Heaven's own palm droop in my hand, And pale among the saints I stand, A saint companionless.” V. Bow lower down before the throne, Triumphant Rosalind! He boweth on thy corpse his face, And weepeth as the blind: 'Twas a dread sight to see them so, For the senseless corpse rocked to and fro With the wail of his living mind. VI. But dreader sight, could such be seen, His inward mind did lie, Whose long-subjected humanness Gave out its lion-cry, And fiercely rent its tenement In a mortal agony. VII. I tell you, friends, had you heard his wail, 'Twould haunt you in court and mart, And in merry feast until you set Your cup down to depart— That weeping wild of a reckless child From a proud man's broken heart. VIII. O broken heart, O broken vow, That wore so proud a feature! God, grasping as a thunderbolt The man's rejected nature, Smote him therewith i' the presence high Of his so worshipped earth and sky That looked on all indifferently— A wailing human creature. IX. A human creature found too weak To bear his human pain— (May Heaven's dear grace have spoken peace To his dying heart and brain!) For when they came at dawn of day To lift the lady's corpse away, Her bier was holding twain. X. They dug beneath the kirkyard grass, For both one dwelling deep; To which, when years had mossed the stone, Sir Roland brought his little son To watch the funeral heap: And when the happy boy would rather Turn upward his blithe eyes to see The wood-doves nodding from the tree, “Nay, boy, look downward,” said his father, “Upon this human dust asleep. And hold it in thy constant ken That God's own unity compresses (One into one) the human many, And that his everlastingness is The bond which is not loosed by any: That thou and I this law must keep, If not in love, in sorrow then,— Though smiling not like other men, Still, like them we must weep.” THE ROMAUNT OF MARGRET. “Can my affections find out nothing best, But still and still remove?” —Quarles. I I plant a tree whose leaf The yew-tree leaf will suit: But when its shade is o'er you laid, Turn round and pluck the fruit. Now reach my harp from off the wall Where shines the sun aslant; The sun may shine and we be cold! O hearken, loving hearts and bold, Unto my wild romaunt. Margret, Margret. II Sitteth the fair ladye Close to the river side Which runneth on with a merry tone Her merry thoughts to guide: It runneth through the trees, It runneth by the hill, Nathless the lady's thoughts have found A way more pleasant still. Margret, Margret. III The night is in her hair And giveth shade to shade, And the pale moonlight on her forehead white Like a spirit's hand is laid; Her lips part with a smile Instead of speakings done: I ween, she thinketh of a voice, Albeit uttering none. Margret, Margret. IV All little birds do sit With heads beneath their wings: Nature doth seem in a mystic dream, Absorbed from her living things: That dream by that ladye Is certes unpartook, For she looketh to the high cold stars With a tender human look. Margret, Margret. V The lady's shadow lies Upon the running river; It lieth no less in its quietness, For that which resteth never: Most like a trusting heart Upon a passing faith, Or as upon the course of life The steadfast doom of death. Margret, Margret. VI The lady doth not move, The lady doth not dream, Yet she seeth her shade no longer laid In rest upon the stream: It shaketh without wind, It parteth from the tide, It standeth upright in the cleft moonlight, It sitteth at her side. Margret, Margret. VII Look in its face, ladye, And keep thee from thy swound; With a spirit bold thy pulses hold And hear its voice's sound: For so will sound thy voice When thy face is to the wall, And such will be thy face, ladye, When the maidens work thy pall. Margret, Margret. VIII “Am I not like to thee?” The voice was calm and low, And between each word you might have heard The silent forests grow; “The like may sway the like;” By which mysterious law Mine eyes from thine and my lips from thine The light and breath may draw. Margret, Margret. IX “My lips do need thy breath, My lips do need thy smile, And my pallid eyne, that light in thine Which met the stars erewhile: Yet go with light and life If that thou lovest one In all the earth who loveth thee As truly as the sun, Margret, Margret.” X Her cheek had waxèd white Like cloud at fall of snow; Then like to one at set of sun, It waxèd red alsò; For love's name maketh bold As if the loved were near: And then she sighed the deep long sigh Which cometh after fear. Margret, Margret. XI “Now, sooth, I fear thee not— Shall never fear thee now!” (And a noble sight was the sudden light Which lit her lifted brow.) “Can earth be dry of streams, Or hearts of love?” she said; “Who doubteth love, can know not love: He is already dead.” Margret, Margret. XII “I have” . . . and here her lips Some word in pause did keep, And gave the while a quiet smile As if they paused in sleep,— “I have . . . a brother dear, A knight of knightly fame! I broidered him a knightly scarf With letters of my name Margret, Margret. XIII “I fed his grey goshawk, I kissed his fierce bloodhoùnd, I sate at home when he might come And caught his horn's far sound: I sang him hunter's songs, I poured him the red wine, He looked across the cup and said, I love thee, sister mine.” Margret, Margret. XIV IT trembled on the grass With a low, shadowy laughter; The sounding river which rolled, for ever Stood dumb and stagnant after: “Brave knight thy brother is! But better loveth he Thy chaliced wine than thy chaunted song, And better both than thee, Margret, Margret.” XV The lady did not heed The river's silence while Her own thoughts still ran at their will, And calm was still her smile. “My little sister wears The look our mother wore: I smooth her locks with a golden comb, I bless her evermore.” Margret, Margret. XVI “I gave her my first bird When first my voice it knew; I made her share my posies rare And told her where they grew: I taught her God's dear name With prayer and praise to tell, She looked from heaven into my face And said, I love thee well.” Margret, Margret. XVII IT trembled on the grass With a low, shadowy laughter; You could see each bird as it woke and stared Through the shrivelled foliage after. “Fair child thy sister is! But better loveth she Thy golden comb than thy gathered flowers, And better both than thee, Margret, Margret.” XVIII Thy lady did not heed The withering on the bough; Still calm her smile, albeit the while A little pale her brow: “I have a father old, The lord of ancient halls; An hundred friends are in his court Yet only me he calls. Margret, Margret. XIX “An hundred knights are in his court Yet read I by his knee; And when forth they go to the tourney-show I rise not up to see: 'Tis a weary book to read, My tryst's at set of sun, But loving and dear beneath the stars Is his blessing when I've done.” Margret, Margret. XX IT trembled on the grass With a low, shadowy laughter; And moon and stars though bright and far Did shrink and darken after. “High lord thy father is! But better loveth he His ancient halls than his hundred friends, His ancient halls, than thee, Margret, Margret.” XXI The lady did not heed That the far stars did fail; Still calm her smile, albeit the while . . . Nay, but she is not pale! “I have more than a friend Across the mountains dim: No other's voice is soft to me, Unless it nameth him.” Margret, Margret. XXII “Though louder beats my heart, I know his tread again, And his fair plume aye, unless turned away, For the tears do blind me then: We brake no gold, a sign Of stronger faith to be, But I wear his last look in my soul, Which said, I love but thee!” Margret, Margret. XXIII IT trembled on the grass With a low, shadowy laughter; And the wind did toll, as a passing soul Were sped by church-bell after; And shadows, 'stead of light, Fell from the stars above, In flakes of darkness on her face Still bright with trusting love. Margret, Margret. XXIV “He loved but only thee! That love is transient too. The wild hawk's bill doth dabble still I' the mouth that vowed thee true: Will he open his dull eyes When tears fall on his brow? Behold, the death-worm to his heart Is a nearer thing than thou, Margret, Margret.” XXV Her face was on the ground— None saw the agony; But the men at sea did that night agree They heard a drowning cry: And when the morning brake, Fast rolled the river's tide, With the green trees waving overhead And a white corse laid beside. Margret, Margret. XXVI A knight's bloodhound and he The funeral watch did keep; With a thought o' the chase he stroked its face As it howled to see him weep. A fair child kissed the dead, But shrank before its cold. And alone yet proudly in his hall Did stand a baron old. Margret, Margret. XXVII Hang up my harp again! I have no voice for song. Not song but wail, and mourners pale, Not bards, to love belong. O failing human love! O light, by darkness known! O false, the while thou treadest earth! O deaf beneath the stone! Margret, Margret. ISOBEL'S CHILD. “? so find we profit, By losing of our prayers.” —Shakespeare. I. To rest the weary nurse has gone: An eight-day watch had watchèd she, Still rocking beneath sun and moon The baby on her knee, Till Isobel its mother said “The fever waneth—wend to bed, For now the watch comes round to me.” II. Then wearily the nurse did throw Her pallet in the darkest place Of that sick room, and slept and dreamed: For, as the gusty wind did blow The night-lamp's flare across her face, She saw or seemed to see, but dreamed, That the poplars tall on the opposite hill, The seven tall poplars on the hill, Did clasp the setting sun until His rays dropped from him, pined and still As blossoms in frost, Till he waned and paled, so weirdly crossed, To the colour of moonlight which doth pass Over the dank ridged churchyard grass. The poplars held the sun, and he The eyes of the nurse that they should not see —Not for a moment, the babe on her knee, Though she shuddered to feel that it grew to be Too chill, and lay too heavily. III. She only dreamed; for all the while 'Twas Lady Isobel that kept The little baby: and it slept Fast, warm, as if its mother's smile, Laden with love's dewy weight, And red as rose of Harpocrate Dropt upon its eyelids, pressed Lashes to cheek in a sealèd rest. IV. And more and more smiled Isobel To see the baby sleep so well— She knew not that she smiled. Against the lattice, dull and wild Drive the heavy droning drops, Drop by drop, the sound being one; As momently time's segments fall On the ear of God, who hears through all Eternity's unbroken monotone: And more and more smiled Isobel To see the baby sleep so well— She knew not that she smiled. The wind in intermission stops Down in the beechen forest, Then cries aloud As one at the sorest, Self-stung, self-driven, And rises up to its very tops, Stiffening erect the branches bowed, Dilating with a tempest-soul The trees that with their dark hands break Through their own outline, and heavy roll Shadows as massive as clouds in heaven Across the castle lake. And more and more smiled Isobel To see the baby sleep so well; She knew not that she smiled; She knew not that the storm was wild; Through the uproar drear she could not hear The castle clock which struck anear— She heard the low, light breathing of her child. V. O sight for wondering look! While the external nature broke Into such abandonment, While the very mist, heart-rent By the lightning, seemed to eddy Against nature, with a din,— A sense of silence and of steady Natural calm appeared to come From things without, and enter in The human creature's room. VI. So motionless she sate, The babe asleep upon her knees, You might have dreamed their souls had gone Away to things inanimate, In such to live, in such to moan; And that their bodies had ta'en back, In mystic change, all silences That cross the sky in cloudy rack, Or dwell beneath the reedy ground In waters safe from their own sound: Only she wore The deepening smile I named before, And that a deepening love expressed; And who at once can love and rest? VII. In sooth the smile that then was keeping Watch upon the baby sleeping, Floated with its tender light Downward, from the drooping eyes, Upward, from the lips apart, Over cheeks which had grown white With an eight-day weeping: All smiles come in such a wise Where tears shall fall or have of old— Like northern lights that fill the heart Of heaven in sign of cold. VIII. Motionless she sate. Her hair had fallen by its weight On each side of her smile and lay Very blackly on the arm Where the baby nestled warm, Pale as baby carved in stone Seen by glimpses of the moon Up a dark cathedral aisle: But, through the storm, no moonbeam fell Upon the child of Isobel— Perhaps you saw it by the ray Alone of her still smile. IX. A solemn thing it is to me To look upon a babe that sleeps Wearing in its spirit-deeps The undeveloped mystery Of our Adam's taint and woe, Which, when they developed be, Will not let it slumber so; Lying new in life beneath The shadow of the coming death, With that soft, low, quiet breath, As if it felt the sun; Knowing all things by their blooms, Not their roots, yea, sun and sky Only by the warmth that comes Out of each, earth only by The pleasant hues that o'er it run, And human love by drops of sweet White nourishment still hanging round The little mouth so slumber-bound: All which broken sentiency And conclusion incomplete, Will gather and unite and climb To an immortality Good or evil, each sublime, Through life and death to life again. O little lids, now folded fast, Must ye learn to drop at last Our large and burning tears? O warm quick body, must thou lie, When the time comes round to die, Still from all the whirl of years, Bare of all the joy and pain? O small frail being, wilt thou stand At God's right hand, Lifting up those sleeping eyes Dilated by great destinies, To an endless waking? thrones and seraphim, Through the long ranks of their solemnities, Sunning thee with calm looks of Heaven's surprise, But thine alone on Him? Or else, self-willed, to tread the Godless place, (God keep thy will!) feel thine own energies Cold, strong, objèctless, like a dead man's clasp, The sleepless deathless life within thee grasp,— While myriad faces, like one changeless face, With woe not love's, shall glass thee everywhere And overcome thee with thine own despair? X. More soft, less solemn images Drifted o'er the lady's heart Silently as snow. She had seen eight days depart Hour by hour, on bended knees, With pale-wrung hands and prayings low And broken, through which came the sound Of tears that fell against the ground, Making sad stops:—“Dear Lord, dear Lord!” She still had prayed, (the heavenly word Broken by an earthly sigh) —“Thou who didst not erst deny The mother-joy to Mary mild, Blessèd in the blessèd child Which hearkened in meek babyhood Her cradle-hymn, albeit used To all that music interfused In breasts of angels high and good! Oh, take not, Lord, my babe away— Oh, take not to thy songful heaven The pretty baby thou hast given, Or ere that I have seen him play Around his father's knees and known That he knew how my love has gone From all the world to him. Think, God among the cherubim, How I shall shiver every day In thy June sunshine, knowing where The grave-grass keeps it from his fair Still cheeks: and feel, at every tread, His little body, which is dead And hidden in thy turfy fold, Doth make thy whole warm earth a-cold! O God, I am so young, so young— I am not used to tears at nights Instead of slumber—not to prayer With sobbing lips and hands out-wrung! Thou knowest all my prayings were ‘I bless thee, God, for past delights— Thank God!’ I am not used to bear Hard thoughts of death; the earth doth cover No face from me of friend or lover: And must the first who teaches me The form of shrouds and funerals, be Mine own first-born belovèd? he Who taught me first this mother-love? Dear Lord who spreadest out above Thy loving, transpierced hands to meet All lifted hearts with blessing sweet,— Pierce not my heart, my tender heart Thou madest tender! Thou who art So happy in thy heaven alway, Take not mine only bliss away!” XI. She so had prayed: and God, who hears Through seraph-songs the sound of tears From that belovèd babe had ta'en The fever and the beating pain. And more and more smiled Isobel To see the baby sleep so well, (She knew not that she smiled, I wis) Until the pleasant gradual thought Which near her heart the smile enwrought, Now soft and slow, itself did seem To float along a happy dream, Beyond it into speech like this. XII. “I prayed for thee, my little child, And God has heard my prayer! And when thy babyhood is gone, We two together undefiled By men's repinings, will kneel down Upon His earth which will be fair (Not covering thee, sweet!) to us twain, And give Him thankful praise.” XIII. Dully and wildly drives the rain: Against the lattices drives the rain. XIV. “I thank Him now, that I can think Of those same future days, Nor from the harmless image shrink Of what I there might see— Strange babies on their mothers' knee, Whose innocent soft faces might From off mine eyelids strike the light, With looks not meant for me!” XV. Gustily blows the wind through the rain, As against the lattices drives the rain. XVI. “But now, O baby mine, together, We turn this hope of ours again To many an hour of summer weather, When we shall sit and intertwine Our spirits, and instruct each other In the pure loves of child and mother! Two human loves make one divine.” XVII. The thunder tears through the wind and the rain, As full on the lattices drives the rain. XVIII. “My little child, what wilt thou choose? Now let me look at thee and ponder. What gladness, from the gladnesses Futurity is spreading under Thy gladsome sight? Beneath the trees Wilt thou lean all day, and lose Thy spirit with the river seen Intermittently between The winding beechen alleys,— Half in labour, half repose, Like a shepherd keeping sheep, Thou, with only thoughts to keep Which never a bound will overpass, And which are innocent as those That feed among Arcadian valleys Upon the dewy grass?” XIX. The large white owl that with age is blind, That hath sate for years in the old tree hollow, Is carried away in a gust of wind; His wings could bear him not as fast As he goeth now the lattice past; He is borne by the winds, the rains do follow His white wings to the blast outflowing, He hooteth in going, And still, in the lightnings, coldly glitter His round unblinking eyes. XX. “Or, baby, wilt thou think it fitter To be eloquent and wise, One upon whose lips the air Turns to solemn verities For men to breathe anew, and win A deeper-seated life within? Wilt be a philosopher, By whose voice the earth and skies Shall speak to the unborn? Or a poet, broadly spreading The golden immortalities Of thy soul on natures lorn And poor of such, them all to guard From their decay,—beneath thy treading, Earth's flowers recovering hues of Eden,— And stars, drawn downward by thy looks, To shine ascendant in thy books?” XXI. The tame hawk in the castle-yard, How it screams to the lightning, with its wet Jagged plumes overhanging the parapet! And at the lady's door the hound Scratches with a crying sound. XXII. “But, O my babe, thy lids are laid Close, fast upon thy cheek, And not a dream of power and sheen Can make a passage up between; Thy heart is of thy mother's made, Thy looks are very meek, And it will be their chosen place To rest on some belovèd face, As these on thine, and let the noise Of the whole world go on nor drown The tender silence of thy joys: Or when that silence shall have grown Too tender for itself, the same Yearning for sound,—to look above And utter its one meaning, love, That He may hear His name.” XXIII. No wind, no rain, no thunder! The waters had trickled not slowly, The thunder was not spent Nor the wind near finishing; Who would have said that the storm was diminishing? No wind, no rain, no thunder! Their noises dropped asunder From the earth and the firmament, From the towers and the lattices, Abrupt and echoless As ripe fruits on the ground unshaken wholly— As life in death! And sudden and solemn the silence fell, Startling the heart of Isobel As the tempest could not: Against the door went panting the breath Of the lady's hound whose cry was still, And she, constrained howe'er she would not, Lifted her eyes and saw the moon Looking out of heaven alone Upon the poplared hill,— A calm of God, made visible That men might bless it at their will. XXIV. The moonshine on the baby's face Falleth clear and cold: The mother's looks have fallen back To the same place: Because no moon with silver rack, Nor broad sunrise in jasper skies Has power to hold Our loving eyes, Which still revert, as ever must Wonder and Hope, to gaze on the dust. XXV. The moonshine on the baby's face Cold and clear remaineth; The mother's looks do shrink away,— The mother's looks return to stay, As charmèd by what paineth: Is any glamour in the case? Is it dream, or is it sight? Hath the change upon the wild Elements that sign the night, Passed upon the child? It is not dream, but sight. XXVI. The babe has awakened from sleep And unto the gaze of its mother, Bent over it, lifted another— Not the baby-looks that go Unaimingly to and fro, But an earnest gazing deep Such as soul gives soul at length When by work and wail of years It winneth a solemn strength And mourneth as it wears. A strong man could not brook, With pulse unhurried by fears, To meet that baby's look O'erglazed by manhood's tears, The tears of a man full grown, With a power to wring our own, In the eyes all undefiled Of a little three-months' child— To see that babe-brow wrought By the witnessing of thought To judgment's prodigy, And the small soft mouth unweaned, By mother's kiss o'erleaned, (Putting the sound of loving Where no sound else was moving Except the speechless cry) Quickened to mind's expression, Shaped to articulation, Yea, uttering words, yea, naming woe, In tones that with it strangely went Because so baby-innocent, As the child spake out to the mother, so:— XXVII. “O mother, mother, loose thy prayer! Christ's name hath made it strong. It bindeth me, it holdeth me With its most loving cruelty, From floating my new soul along The happy heavenly air. It bindeth me, it holdeth me In all this dark, upon this dull Low earth, by only weepers trod. It bindeth me, it holdeth me! Mine angel looketh sorrowful Upon the face of God. For I say unto you that in Heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven. —Matt. xviii. 10. XXVIII. “Mother, mother, can I dream Beneath your earthly trees? I had a vision and a gleam, I heard a sound more sweet than these When rippled by the wind: Did you see the Dove with wings Bathed in golden glisterings From a sunless light behind, Dropping on me from the sky, Soft as mother's kiss, until I seemed to leap and yet was still? Saw you how His love-large eye Looked upon me mystic calms, Till the power of His divine Vision was indrawn to mine? XXIX. “Oh, the dream within the dream! I saw celestial places even. Oh, the vistas of high palms Making finites of delight Through the heavenly infinite, Lifting up their green still tops To the heaven of heaven! Oh, the sweet life-tree that drops Shade like light across the river Glorified in its for-ever Flowing from the Throne! Oh, the shining holinesses Of the thousand, thousand faces God-sunned by the thronèd One, And made intense with such a love That, though I saw them turned above, Each loving seemed for also me! And, oh, the Unspeakable, the He, The manifest in secrecies Yet of mine own heart partaker With the overcoming look Of One who hath been once forsook And blesseth the forsaker! Mother, mother, let me go Toward the Face that looketh so! Through the mystic wingèd Four Whose are inward, outward eyes Dark with light of mysteries And the restless evermore ‘Holy, holy, holy,’—through The sevenfold Lamps that burn in view Of cherubim and seraphim,— Through the four-and-twenty crowned Stately elders white around, Suffer me to go to Him! XXX. “Is your wisdom very wise, Mother, on the narrow earth, Very happy, very worth That I should stay to learn? Are these air-corrupting sighs Fashioned by unlearnèd breath? Do the students' lamps that burn All night, illumine death? Mother, albeit this be so, Loose thy prayer and let me go Where that bright chief angel stands Apart from all his brother bands, Too glad for smiling, having bent In angelic wilderment O'er the depths of God, and brought Reeling thence one only thought To fill his own eternity. He the teacher is for me— He can teach what I would know— Mother, mother, let me go! XXXI. “Can your poet make an Eden No winter will undo, And light a starry fire while heeding His hearth's is burning too? Drown in music the earth's din, And keep his own wild soul within The law of his own harmony? Mother, albeit this be so, Let me to my heaven go! A little harp me waits thereby, A harp whose strings are golden all And tuned to music spherical, Hanging on the green life-tree Where no willows ever be. Shall I miss that harp of mine? Mother, no!—the Eye divine Turned upon it, makes it shine; And when I touch it, poems sweet Like separate souls shall fly from it, Each to the immortal fytte. We shall all be poets there, Gazing on the chiefest Fair. XXXII. “Love! earth's love! and can we love Fixedly where all things move? Can the sinning love each other? Mother, mother, I tremble in thy close embrace, I feel thy tears adown my face, Thy prayers do keep me out of bliss— O dreary earthly love! Loose thy prayer and let me go To the place which loving is Yet not sad; and when is given Escape to thee from this below, Thou shalt behold me that I wait For thee beside the happy Gate, And silence shall be up in heaven To hear our greeting kiss.” XXXIII. The nurse awakes in the morning sun, And starts to see beside her bed The lady with a grandeur spread Like pathos o'er her face, as one God-satisfied and earth-undone; The babe upon her arm was dead: And the nurse could utter forth no cry,— She was awed by the calm in the mother's eye. XXXIV. “Wake, nurse!” the lady said; “We are waking—he and I— I, on earth, and he, in sky: And thou must help me to o'erlay With garment white this little clay Which needs no more our lullaby. XXXV. “I changed the cruel prayer I made, And bowed my meekened face, and prayed That God would do His will; and thus He did it, nurse! He parted us: And His sun shows victorious The dead calm face,—and I am calm, And Heaven is hearkening a new psalm. XXXVI. “This earthly noise is too anear, Too loud, and will not let me hear The little harp. My death will soon Make silence.” And a sense of tune, A satisfièd love meanwhile Which nothing earthly could despoil, Sang on within her soul. XXXVII. Oh you, Earth's tender and impassioned few, Take courage to entrust your love To Him so named who guards above Its ends and shall fulfil! Breaking the narrow prayers that may Befit your narrow hearts, away In His broad, loving will. A ROMANCE OF THE GANGES. I Seven maidens 'neath the midnight Stand near the river-sea Whose water sweepeth white around The shadow of the tree; The moon and earth are face to face, And earth is slumbering deep; The wave-voice seems the voice of dreams That wander through her sleep: The river floweth on. II What bring they 'neath the midnight, Beside the river-sea? They bring the human heart wherein No nightly calm can be,— That droppeth never with the wind, Nor drieth with the dew: Oh, calm in God! thy calm is broad To cover spirits too. The river floweth on. III The maidens lean them over The waters, side by side, And shun each other's deepening eyes, And gaze adown the tide; For each within a little boat A little lamp hath put, And heaped for freight some lily's weight Or scarlet rose half shut. The river floweth on. IV Of shell of cocoa carven Each little boat is made; Each carries a lamp, and carries a flower, And carries a hope unsaid; And when the boat hath carried the lamp Unquenched till out of sight, The maiden is sure that love will endure; But love will fail with light. The river floweth on. V Why, all the stars are ready To symbolize the soul, The stars untroubled by the wind, Unwearied as they roll; And yet the soul by instinct sad Reverts to symbols low— To that small flame, whose very name Breathed o'er it, shakes it so! The river floweth on. VI Six boats are on the river, Seven maidens on the shore, While still above them steadfastly The stars shine evermore. Go, little boats, go soft and safe, And guard the symbol spark! The boats aright go safe and bright Across the waters dark. The river floweth on. VII The maiden Luti watcheth Where onwardly they float: That look in her dilating eyes Might seem to drive her boat: Her eyes still mark the constant fire, And kindling unawares That hopeful while, she lets a smile Creep silent through her prayers. The river floweth on. VIII The smile—where hath it wandered? She riseth from her knee, She holds her dark, wet locks away— There is no light to see! She cries a quick and bitter cry— “Nuleeni, launch me thine! We must have light abroad to-night, For all the wreck of mine.” The river floweth on. IX “I do remember watching Beside this river-bed, When on my childish knee was leaned My dying father's head; I turned mine own to keep the tears From falling on his face: What doth it prove when Death and Love Choose out the self-same place?” The river floweth on. X “They say the dead are joyful The death-change here receiving: Who say—ah me! who dare to say Where joy comes to the living? Thy boat, Nuleeni! look not sad— Light up the waters rather! I weep no faithless lover where I wept a loving father.” The river floweth on. XI “My heart foretold his falsehood Ere my little boat grew dim; And though I closed mine eyes to dream That one last dream of him, They shall not now be wet to see The shining vision go: From earth's cold love I look above To the holy house of snow.” The Hindoo heaven is localized on the summit of Mount Meru—one of the mountains of Himalaya or Himmaleh, which signifies, I believe, in Sanscrit, the abode of snow, winter, or coldness. The river floweth on. XII “Come thou—thou never knewest A grief, that thou shouldst fear one! Thou wearest still the happy look That shines beneath a dear one: Thy humming-bird is in the sun, Himadeva, the Indian god of love, is imagined to wander through the three worlds, accompanied by the humming-bird, cuckoo, and gentle breezes. Thy cuckoo in the grove, And all the three broad worlds, for thee Are full of wandering love.” The river floweth on. XIII “Why, maiden, dost thou loiter? What secret wouldst thou cover? That peepul cannot hide thy boat, And I can guess thy lover; I heard thee sob his name in sleep, It was a name I knew: Come, little maid, be not afraid, But let us prove him true!” The river floweth on. XIV The little maiden cometh, She cometh shy and slow; I ween she seeth through her lids They drop adown so low: Her tresses meet her small bare feet, She stands and speaketh nought, Yet blusheth red as if she said The name she only thought. The river floweth on. XV She knelt beside the water, She lighted up the flame, And o'er her youthful forehead's calm The fitful radiance came:— “Go, little boat, go soft and safe, And guard the symbol spark!” Soft, safe doth float the little boat Across the waters dark. The river floweth on. XVI Glad tears her eyes have blinded, The light they cannot reach; She turneth with that sudden smile She learnt before her speech— “I do not hear his voice, the tears Have dimmed my light away, But the symbol light will last to-night, The love will last for aye!” The river floweth on. XVII Then Luti spake behind her, Outspake she bitterly— “By the symbol light that lasts to-night, Wilt vow a vow to me?” Nuleeni gazeth up her face, Soft answer maketh she— “By loves that last when lights are past, I vow that vow to thee!” The river floweth on. XVIII An earthly look had Luti Though her voice was deep as prayer— “The rice is gathered from the plains To cast upon thine hair: The casting of rice upon the head, and the fixing of the band or tali about the neck, are parts of the Hindoo marriage ceremonial. But when he comes his marriage-band Around thy neck to throw, Thy bride-smile raise to meet his gaze, And whisper,—There is one betrays, While Luti suffers woe.” The river floweth on. XIX “And when in seasons after, Thy little bright-faced son Shall lean against thy knee and ask What deeds his sire hath done,— Press deeper down thy mother-smile His glossy curls among, View deep his pretty childish eyes, And whisper,—There is none denies, While Luti speaks of wrong.” The river floweth on. XX Nuleeni looked in wonder, Yet softly answered she— “By loves that last when lights are past, I vowed that vow to thee: But why glads it thee that a bride-day be By a word of woe defiled? That a word of wrong take the cradle-song From the ear of a sinless child?” “Why?” Luti said, and her laugh was dread, And her eyes dilated wild— “That the fair new love may her bridegroom prove, And the father shame the child!” The river floweth on. XXI “Thou flowest still, O river, Thou flowest 'neath the moon; Thy lily hath not changed a leaf, The Ganges is represented as a white woman, with a water-lily in her right hand, and in her left a lute. Thy charmèd lute a tune: He mixed his voice with thine and his Was all I heard around; But now, beside his chosen bride, I hear the river's sound.” The river floweth on. XXII “I gaze upon her beauty Through the tresses that enwreathe it; The light above thy wave, is hers— My rest, alone beneath it: Oh, give me back the dying look My father gave thy water! Give back—and let a little love O'erwatch his weary daughter!” The river floweth on. XXIII “Give back!” she hath departed— The word is wandering with her; And the stricken maidens hear afar The step and cry together. Frail symbols? None are frail enow For mortal joys to borrow!— While bright doth float Nuleeni's boat, She weepeth dark with sorrow. The river floweth on. AN ISLAND. “All goeth but Goddis will.” —Old Poet. I My dream is of an island-place Which distant seas keep lonely, A little island on whose face The stars are watchers only: Those bright still stars! they need not seem Brighter or stiller in my dream. II An island full of hills and dells, All rumpled and uneven With green recesses, sudden swells, And odorous valleys driven So deep and straight that always there The wind is cradled to soft air. III Hills running up to heaven for light Through woods that half-way ran, As if the wild earth mimicked right The wilder heart of man: Only it shall be greener far And gladder than hearts ever are. IV More like, perhaps, that mountain piece Of Dante's paradise, Disrupt to an hundred hills like these, In falling from the skies; Bringing within it, all the roots Of heavenly trees and flowers and fruits: V For—saving where the grey rocks strike Their javelins up the azure, Or where deep fissures miser-like Hoard up some fountain treasure, (And e'en in them, stoop down and hear, Leaf sounds with water in your ear,—) VI The place is all awave with trees, Limes, myrtles purple-beaded, Acacias having drunk the lees Of the night-dew, faint-headed, And wan grey olive-woods which seem The fittest foliage for a dream. VII Trees, trees on all sides! they combine Their plumy shades to throw, Through whose clear fruit and blossom fine Whene'er the sun may go, The ground beneath the deeply stains, As passing through cathedral panes. VIII But little needs this earth of ours That shining from above her, When many Pleiades of flowers (Not one lost) star her over, The rays of their unnumbered hues Being all refracted by the dews. IX Wide-petalled plants that boldly drink The Amreeta of the sky, Shut bells that dull with rapture sink, And lolling buds, half shy; I cannot count them, but between Is room for grass and mosses green, X And brooks, that glass in different strengths All colours in disorder, Or, gathering up their silver lengths Beside their winding border, Sleep, haunted through the slumber hidden, By lilies white as dreams in Eden. XI Nor think each archèd tree with each Too closely interlaces To admit of vistas out of reach, And broad moon-lighted places Upon whose sward the antlered deer May view their double image clear. XII For all this island's creature-full, (Kept happy not by halves) Mild cows, that at the vine-wreaths pull, Then low back at their calves With tender lowings, to approve The warm mouths milking them for love. XIII Free gamesome horses, antelopes, And harmless leaping leopards, And buffaloes upon the slopes, And sheep unruled by shepherds: Hares, lizards, hedgehogs, badgers, mice, Snakes, squirrels, frogs, and butterflies. XIV And birds that live there in a crowd, Horned owls, rapt nightingales, Larks bold with heaven, and peacocks proud, Self-sphered in those grand tails; All creatures glad and safe, I deem. No guns nor springes in my dream! XV The island's edges are a-wing With trees that overbranch The sea with song-birds welcoming The curlews to green change; And doves from half-closed lids espy The red and purple fish go by. XVI One dove is answering in trust The water every minute, Thinking so soft a murmur must Have her mate's cooing in it: So softly doth earth's beauty round Infuse itself in ocean's sound. XVII My sanguine soul bounds forwarder To meet the bounding waves; Beside them straightway I repair, To live within the caves: And near me two or three may dwell Whom dreams fantastic please as well. XVIII Long winding caverns, glittering far Into a crystal distance! Through clefts of which shall many a star Shine clear without resistance, And carry down its rays the smell Of flowers above invisible. XIX I said that two or three might choose Their dwelling near mine own: Those who would change man's voice and use, For Nature's way and tone— Man's veering heart and careless eyes, For Nature's steadfast sympathies. XX Ourselves, to meet her faithfulness, Shall play a faithful part; Her beautiful shall ne'er address The monstrous at our heart: Her musical shall ever touch Something within us also such. XXI Yet shall she not our mistress live, As doth the moon of ocean, Though gently as the moon she give Our thoughts a light and motion: More like a harp of many lays, Moving its master while he plays. XXII No sod in all that island doth Yawn open for the dead; No wind hath borne a traitor's oath; No earth, a mourner's tread; We cannot say by stream or shade, “I suffered here,—was here betrayed.” XXIII Our only “farewell” we shall laugh To shifting cloud or hour, And use our only epitaph To some bud turned a flower: Our only tears shall serve to prove Excess in pleasure or in love. XXIV Our fancies shall their plumage catch From fairest island-birds, Whose eggs let young ones out at hatch, Born singing! then our words Unconsciously shall take the dyes Of those prodigious fantasies. XXV Yea, soon, no consonant unsmooth Our smile-tuned lips shall reach; Sounds sweet as Hellas spake in youth Shall glide into our speech: (What music, certes, can you find As soft as voices which are kind?) XXVI And often, by the joy without And in us, overcome, We, through our musing, shall let float Such poems,—sitting dumb,— As Pindar might have writ if he Had tended sheep in Arcady; XXVII Or Æschylus—the pleasant fields He died in, longer knowing; Or Homer, had men's sins and shields Been lost in Meles flowing; Or Poet Plato, had the undim Unsetting Godlight broke on him. XXVIII Choose me the cave most worthy choice, To make a place for prayer, And I will choose a praying voice To pour our spirits there: How silverly the echoes run! Thy will be done,—thy will be done. XXIX Gently yet strangely uttered words! They lift me from my dream; The island fadeth with its swards That did no more than seem: The streams are dry, no sun could find— The fruits are fallen, without wind. XXX So oft the doing of God's will Our foolish wills undoeth! And yet what idle dream breaks ill, Which morning-light subdueth? And who would murmur and misdoubt, When God's great sunrise finds him out? THE DESERTED GARDEN. I mind me in the days departed, How often underneath the sun With childish bounds I used to run To a garden long deserted. The beds and walks were vanished quite; And wheresoe'er had struck the spade, The greenest grasses Nature laid To sanctify her right. I called the place my wilderness, For no one entered there but I; The sheep looked in, the grass to espy, And passed it ne'ertheless. The trees were interwoven wild, And spread their boughs enough about To keep both sheep and shepherd out, But not a happy child. Adventurous joy it was for me! I crept beneath the boughs, and found A circle smooth of mossy ground Beneath a poplar tree. Old garden rose-trees hedged it in, Bedropt with roses waxen-white Well satisfied with dew and light And careless to be seen. Long years ago it might befall, When all the garden flowers were trim, The grave old gardener prided him On these the most of all. Some lady, stately overmuch, Here moving with a silken noise, Has blushed beside them at the voice That likened her to such. And these, to make a diadem, She often may have plucked and twined, Half-smiling as it came to mind That few would look at them. Oh, little thought that lady proud, A child would watch her fair white rose, When buried lay her whiter brows, And silk was changed for shroud! Nor thought that gardener, (full of scorns For men unlearned and simple phrase,) A child would bring it all its praise By creeping through the thorns! To me upon my low moss seat, Though never a dream the roses sent Of science or love's compliment, I ween they smelt as sweet. It did not move my grief to see The trace of human step departed: Because the garden was deserted, The blither place for me! Friends, blame me not! a narrow ken Has childhood 'twixt the sun and sward; We draw the moral afterward, We feel the gladness then. And gladdest hours for me did glide In silence at the rose-tree wall: A thrush made gladness musical Upon the other side. Nor he nor I did e'er incline To peck or pluck the blossoms white; How should I know but roses might Lead lives as glad as mine? To make my hermit-home complete, I brought clear water from the spring Praised in its own low murmuring, And cresses glossy wet. And so, I thought, my likeness grew (Without the melancholy tale) To “gentle hermit of the dale,” And Angelina too. For oft I read within my nook Such minstrel stories; till the breeze Made sounds poetic in the trees, And then I shut the book. If I shut this wherein I write I hear no more the wind athwart Those trees, nor feel that childish heart Delighting in delight. My childhood from my life is parted, My footstep from the moss which drew Its fairy circle round: anew The garden is deserted. Another thrush may there rehearse The madrigals which sweetest are; No more for me! myself afar Do sing a sadder verse. Ah me, ah me! when erst I lay In that child's-nest so greenly wrought, I laughed unto myself and thought “The time will pass away.” And still I laughed, and did not fear But that, whene'er was past away The childish time, some happier play My womanhood would cheer. I knew the time would pass away, And yet, beside the rose-tree wall, Dear God, how seldom, if at all, Did I look up to pray! The time is past; and now that grows The cypress high among the trees, And I behold white sepulchres As well as the white rose,— When graver, meeker thoughts are given, And I have learnt to lift my face, Reminded how earth's greenest place The colour draws from heaven,— It something saith for earthly pain, But more for Heavenly promise free, That I who was, would shrink to be That happy child again. THE SOUL'S TRAVELLING. “??? ??????? ??????? ???????.” —Synesius. I. I dwell amid the city ever. The great humanity which beats Its life along the stony streets, Like a strong and unsunned river In a self-made course, I sit and hearken while it rolls. Very sad and very hoarse Certes is the flow of souls; Infinitest tendencies By the finite prest and pent, In the finite, turbulent: How we tremble in surprise When sometimes, with an awful sound, God's great plummet strikes the ground! II. The champ of the steeds on the silver bit, As they whirl the rich man's carriage by; The beggar's whine as he looks at it,— But it goes too fast for charity; The trail on the street of the poor man's broom, That the lady who walks to her palace-home, On her silken skirt may catch no dust; The tread of the business-men who must Count their per-cents by the paces they take; The cry of the babe unheard of its mother Though it lie on her breast, while she thinks of the other Laid yesterday where it will not wake; The flower-girl's prayer to buy roses and pinks Held out in the smoke, like stars by day; The gin-door's oath that hollowly chinks Guilt upon grief and wrong upon hate; The cabman's cry to get out of the way; The dustman's call down the area-grate; The young maid's jest, and the old wife's scold, The haggling talk of the boys at a stall, The fight in the street which is backed for gold, The plea of the lawyers in Westminster Hall; The drop on the stones of the blind man's staff As he trades in his own grief's sacredness, The brothel shriek, and the Newgate laugh, The hum upon 'Change, and the organ's grinding, (The grinder's face being nevertheless Dry and vacant of even woe While the children's hearts are leaping so At the merry music's winding;) The black-plumed funeral's creeping train, Long and slow (and yet they will go As fast as Life though it hurry and strain!) Creeping the populous houses through And nodding their plumes at either side,— At many a house, where an infant, new To the sunshiny world, has just struggled and cried,— At many a house where sitteth a bride Trying to-morrow's coronals With a scarlet blush to-day: Slowly creep the funerals, As none should hear the noise and say “The living, the living must go away To multiply the dead.” Hark! an upward shout is sent, In grave strong joy from tower to steeple The bells ring out, The trumpets sound, the people shout, The young queen goes to her Parliament. She turneth round her large blue eyes More bright with childish memories Than royal hopes, upon the people; On either side she bows her head Lowly, with a queenly grace And smile most trusting-innocent, As if she smiled upon her mother; The thousands press before each other To bless her to her face; And booms the deep majestic voice Through trump and drum,—“May the queen rejoice In the people's liberties!” III. I dwell amid the city, And hear the flow of souls in act and speech, For pomp or trade, for merrymake or folly: I hear the confluence and sum of each, And that is melancholy! Thy voice is a complaint, O crownèd city, The blue sky covering thee like God's great pity. IV. O blue sky! it mindeth me Of places where I used to see Its vast unbroken circle thrown From the far pale-peakèd hill Out to the last verge of ocean, As by God's arm it were done Then for the first time, with the emotion Of that first impulse on it still. Oh, we spirits fly at will Faster than the wingèd steed Whereof in old book we read, With the sunlight foaming back From his flanks to a misty wrack, And his nostril reddening proud As he breasteth the steep thunder-cloud,— Smoother than Sabrina's chair Gliding up from wave to air, While she smileth debonair Yet holy, coldly and yet brightly, Like her own mooned waters nightly, Through her dripping hair. V. Very fast and smooth we fly, Spirits, though the flesh be by; All looks feed not from the eye Nor all hearings from the ear: We can hearken and espy Without either, we can journey Bold and gay as knight to tourney, And, though we wear no visor down To dark our countenance, the foe Shall never chafe us as we go. VI. I am gone from peopled town! It passeth its street-thunder round My body which yet hears no sound, For now another sound, another Vision, my soul's senses have— O'er a hundred valleys deep Where the hills' green shadows sleep Scarce known because the valley-trees Cross those upland images, O'er a hundred hills each other Watching to the western wave, I have travelled,—I have found The silent, lone, remembered ground. VII. I have found a grassy niche Hollowed in a seaside hill, As if the ocean-grandeur which Is aspectable from the place, Had struck the hill as with a mace Sudden and cleaving. You might fill That little nook with the little cloud Which sometimes lieth by the moon To beautify a night of June; A cavelike nook which, opening all To the wide sea, is disallowed From its own earth's sweet pastoral: Cavelike, but roofless overhead And made of verdant banks instead Of any rocks, with flowerets spread Instead of spar and stalactite, Cowslips and daisies gold and white: Such pretty flowers on such green sward, You think the sea they look toward Doth serve them for another sky As warm and blue as that on high. VIII. And in this hollow is a seat, And when you shall have crept to it, Slipping down the banks too steep To be o'erbrowzèd by the sheep, Do not think—though at your feet The cliff's disrupt—you shall behold The line where earth and ocean meet; You sit too much above to view The solemn confluence of the two: You can hear them as they greet, You can hear that evermore Distance-softened noise more old Than Nereid's singing, the tide spent Joining soft issues with the shore In harmony of discontent, And when you hearken to the grave Lamenting of the underwave, You must believe in earth's communion Albeit you witness not the union. IX. Except that sound, the place is full Of silences, which when you cull By any word, it thrills you so That presently you let them grow To meditation's fullest length Across your soul with a soul's strength: And as they touch your soul, they borrow Both of its grandeur and its sorrow, That deathly odour which the clay Leaves on its deathlessness alwày. X. Alway! alway? must this be? Rapid Soul from city gone, Dost thou carry inwardly What doth make the city's moan? Must this deep sigh of thine own Haunt thee with humanity? Green visioned banks that are too steep To be o'erbrowzèd by the sheep, May all sad thoughts adown you creep Without a shepherd? Mighty sea, Can we dwarf thy magnitude And fit it to our straitest mood? O fair, fair Nature, are we thus Impotent and querulous Among thy workings glorious, Wealth and sanctities, that still Leave us vacant and defiled And wailing like a soft-kissed child, Kissed soft against his will? XI. God, God! With a child's voice I cry, Weak, sad, confidingly— God, God! Thou knowest, eyelids, raised not always up Unto Thy love, (as none of ours are) droop As ours, o'er many a tear; Thou knowest, though Thy universe is broad, Two little tears suffice to cover all: Thou knowest, Thou who art so prodigal Of beauty, we are oft but stricken deer Expiring in the woods, that care for none Of those delightsome flowers they die upon. XII. O blissful Mouth which breathed the mournful breath We name our souls, self-spoilt!—by that strong passion Which paled Thee once with sighs, by that strong death Which made Thee once unbreathing—from the wrack Themselves have called around them, call them back, Back to Thee in continuous aspiration! For here, O Lord, For here they travel vainly, vainly pass From city-pavement to untrodden sward Where the lark finds her deep nest in the grass Cold with the earth's last dew. Yea, very vain The greatest speed of all these souls of men Unless they travel upward to the throne Where sittest Thou the satisfying One, With help for sins and holy perfectings For all requirements: while the archangel, raising Unto Thy face his full ecstatic gazing, Forgets the rush and rapture of his wings. SOUNDS. “??????? ? ??? ???????.” —Æschylus. I. Hearken, hearken! The rapid river carrieth Many noises underneath The hoary ocean: Teaching his solemnity Sounds of inland life and glee Learnt beside the waving tree When the winds in summer prank Toss the shades from bank to bank, And the quick rains, in emotion Which rather gladdens earth than grieves, Count and visibly rehearse The pulses of the universe Upon the summer leaves— Learnt among the lilies straight When they bow them to the weight Of many bees whose hidden hum Seemeth from themselves to come— Learnt among the grasses green Where the rustling mice are seen By the gleaming, as they run, Of their quick eyes in the sun; And lazy sheep are browsing through With their noses trailed in dew; And the squirrel leaps adown Holding fast the filbert brown; And the lark, with more of mirth In his song than suits the earth, Droppeth some in soaring high, To pour the rest out in the sky; While the woodland doves apart In the copse's leafy heart, Solitary, not ascetic, Hidden and yet vocal, seem Joining, in a lovely psalm, Man's despondence, nature's calm, Half mystical and half pathetic, Like a singing in a dream. “While floating up bright forms ideal, Mistress or friend, around me stream; Half sense-supplied, and half unreal, Like music mingling with a dream.” —John Kenyon. I do not doubt that the “music” of the two concluding lines mingled, though very unconsciously, with my own “dream,” and gave their form and pressure to the above distich. The ideas however being sufficiently distinct, I am satisfied with sending this note to the press after my verses, and with acknowledging another obligation to the valued friend to whom I already owe so many. (1844.) All these sounds the river telleth, Softened to an undertone Which ever and anon he swelleth By a burden of his own, In the ocean's ear: Ay, and ocean seems to hear With an inward gentle scorn, Smiling to his caverns worn. II. Hearken, hearken! The child is shouting at his play Just in the tramping funeral's way; The widow moans as she turns aside To shun the face of the blushing bride While, shaking the tower of the ancient church, The marriage bells do swing; And in the shadow of the porch An idiot sits with his lean hands full Of hedgerow flowers and a poet's skull, Laughing loud and gibbering Because it is so brown a thing, While he sticketh the gaudy poppies red In and out the senseless head Where all sweet fancies grew instead: And you may hear at the self-same time. Another poet who reads his rhyme, Low as a brook in summer air, Save when he droppeth his voice adown To dream of the amaranthine crown His mortal brows shall wear: And a baby cries with a feeble sound 'Neath the weary weight of the life new-found, And an old man groans,—with his testament Only half-signed,—for the life that's spent; And lovers twain do softly say, As they sit on a grave, “For aye, for aye!” And foemen twain, while Earth their mother Looks greenly upward, curse each other: A school-boy drones his task, with looks Cast over the page to the elm-tree rooks; A lonely student cries aloud Eureka! clasping at his shroud; A beldame's age-cracked voice doth sing To a little infant slumbering; A maid forgotten weeps alone, Muffling her sobs on the trysting-stone; A sick man wakes at his own mouth's wail, A gossip coughs in her thrice-told tale, A muttering gamester shakes the dice, A reaper foretells goodluck from the skies, A monarch vows as he lifts his hand to them; A patriot, leaving his native land to them, Cries to the world against perjured state; A priest disserts Upon linen skirts, A sinner screams for one hope more, A dancer's feet do palpitate A piper's music out on the floor; And nigh to the awful Dead, the living Low speech and stealthy steps are giving, Because he cannot hear; And he who on that narrow bier Has room enough, is closely wound In a silence piercing more than sound. III. Hearken, hearken! God speaketh to thy soul, Using the sùpreme voice which doth confound All life with consciousness of Deity, All senses into one,— As the seer-saint of Patmos, loving John (For whom did backward roll The cloud-gate of the future) turned to see The Voice which spake. It speaketh now, Through the regular breath of the calm creation, Through the moan of the creature's desolation Striking, and in its stroke resembling The memory of a solemn vow Which pierceth the din of a festival To one in the midst,—and he letteth fall The cup with a sudden trembling. IV. Hearken, hearken! God speaketh in thy soul, Saying, “O thou that movest With feeble steps across this earth of Mine, To break beside the fount thy golden bowl And spill its purple wine,— Look up to heaven and see how, like a scroll, My right hand hath thine immortality In an eternal grasping! thou, that lovest The songful birds and grasses underfoot, And also what change mars and tombs pollute— I am the end of love! give love to Me! O thou that sinnest, grace doth more abound Than all thy sin! sit still beneath My rood, And count the droppings of My victim-blood, And seek none other sound!” V. Hearken, hearken! Shall we hear the lapsing river And our brother's sighing ever, And not the voice of God? NIGHT AND THE MERRY MAN. NIGHT. 'Neath my moon what doest thou, With a somewhat paler brow Than she giveth to the ocean? He, without a pulse or motion, Muttering low before her stands, Lifting his invoking hands Like a seer before a sprite, To catch her oracles of light: But thy soul out-trembles now Many pulses on thy brow. Where be all thy laughters clear, Others laughed alone to hear? Where thy quaint jests, said for fame? Where thy dances, mixed with game? Where thy festive companies, Moonèd o'er with ladies' eyes All more bright for thee, I trow? 'Neath my moon what doest thou? THE MERRY MAN. I am digging my warm heart Till I find its coldest part; I am digging wide and low, Further than a spade will go, Till that, when the pit is deep And large enough, I there may heap All my present pain and past Joy, dead things that look aghast By the daylight: now 'tis done. Throw them in, by one and one! I must laugh, at rising sun. Memories—of fancy's golden Treasures which my hands have holden, Till the chillness made them ache; Of childhood's hopes that used to wake If birds were in a singing strain, And for less cause, sleep again; Of the moss-seat in the wood Where I trysted solitude; Of the hill-top where the wind Used to follow me behind, Then in sudden rush to blind Both my glad eyes with my hair, Taken gladly in the snare; Of the climbing up the rocks, Of the playing 'neath the oaks Which retain beneath them now Only shadow of the bough; Of the lying on the grass While the clouds did overpass, Only they, so lightly driven, Seeming betwixt me and Heaven; Of the little prayers serene, Murmuring of earth and sin; Of large-leaved philosophy Leaning from my childish knee; Of poetic book sublime, Soul-kissed for the first dear time, Greek or English, ere I knew Life was not a poem too:— Throw them in, by one and one! I must laugh, at rising sun. —Of the glorious ambitions Yet unquenched by their fruitions; Of the reading out the nights; Of the straining at mad heights; Of achievements, less descried By a dear few than magnified; Of praises from the many earned When praise from love was undiscerned; Of the sweet reflecting gladness Softened by itself to sadness:— Throw them in, by one and one! I must laugh, at rising sun. What are these? more, more than these! Throw in dearer memories!— Of voices whereof but to speak Makes mine own all sunk and weak; Of smiles the thought of which is sweeping All my soul to floods of weeping; Of looks whose absence fain would weigh My looks to the ground for aye; Of clasping hands—ah me, I wring Mine, and in a tremble fling Downward, downward all this paining! Partings with the sting remaining, Meetings with a deeper throe Since the joy is ruined so, Changes with a fiery burning, (Shadows upon all the turning,) Thoughts of . . . with a storm they came, Them I have not breath to name: Downward, downward be they cast In the pit! and now at last My work beneath the moon is done, And I shall laugh, at rising sun. But let me pause or ere I cover All my treasures darkly over: I will speak not in thine ears, Only tell my beaded tears Silently, most silently. When the last is calmly told, Let that same moist rosary With the rest sepùlchred be, Finished now! The darksome mould Sealeth up the darksome pit. I will lay no stone on it, Grasses I will sow instead, Fit for Queen Titania's tread; Flowers, encoloured with the sun, And ?? ?? written upon none; Thus, whenever saileth by The Lady World of dainty eye, Not a grief shall here remain, Silken shoon to damp or stain: And while she lisps, “I have not seen Any place more smooth and clean” . . . Here she cometh!—Ha, ha!—who Laughs as loud as I can do? EARTH AND HER PRAISERS. I. The Earth is old; Six thousand winters make her heart a-cold; The sceptre slanteth from her palsied hold. She saith, “'Las me! God's word that I was ‘good’ Is taken back to heaven, From whence when any sound comes, I am riven By some sharp bolt; and now no angel would Descend with sweet dew-silence on my mountains, To glorify the lovely river fountains That gush along their side: I see—O weary change!—I see instead This human wrath and pride, These thrones and tombs, judicial wrong and blood, And bitter words are poured upon mine head— ‘O Earth! thou art a stage for tricks unholy, A church for most remorseful melancholy; Thou art so spoilt, we should forget we had An Eden in thee, wert thou not so sad!’ Sweet children, I am old! ye, every one, Do keep me from a portion of my sun. Give praise in change for brightness! That I may shake my hills in infiniteness Of breezy laughter, as in youthful mirth, To hear Earth's sons and daughters praising Earth.” II. Whereupon a child began With spirit running up to man As by angels' shining ladder, (May he find no cloud above!) Seeming he had ne'er been sadder All his days than now, Sitting in the chestnut grove, With that joyous overflow Of smiling from his mouth o'er brow And cheek and chin, as if the breeze Leaning tricksy from the trees To part his golden hairs, had blown Into an hundred smiles that one. III. “O rare, rare Earth!” he saith, “I will praise thee presently; Not to-day; I have no breath: I have hunted squirrels three— Two ran down in the furzy hollow Where I could not see nor follow, One sits at the top of the filbert-tree, With a yellow nut and a mock at me: Presently it shall be done! When I see which way these two have run, When the mocking one at the filbert-top Shall leap adown and beside me stop, Then, rare Earth, rare Earth, Will I pause, having known thy worth, To say all good of thee!” IV. Next a lover,—with a dream 'Neath his waking eyelids hidden, And a frequent sigh unbidden, And an idlesse all the day Beside a wandering stream, And a silence that is made Of a word he dares not say,— Shakes slow his pensive head: “Earth, Earth!” saith he, “If spirits, like thy roses, grew On one stalk, and winds austere Could but only blow them near, To share each other's dew;— If, when summer rains agree To beautify thy hills, I knew Looking off them I might see Some one very beauteous too,— Then Earth,” saith he, “I would praise . . . nay, nay—not thee!” V. Will the pedant name her next? Crabbèd with a crabbèd text Sits he in his study nook, With his elbow on a book, And with stately crossèd knees, And a wrinkle deeply thrid Through his lowering brow, Caused by making proofs enow That Plato in “Parmenides” Meant the same Spinoza did,— Or, that an hundred of the groping Like himself, had made one Homer, Homeros being a misnomer. What hath he to do with praise Of Earth or aught? Whene'er the sloping Sunbeams through his window daze His eyes off from the learned phrase, Straightway he draws close the curtain. May abstraction keep him dumb! Were his lips to ope, 'tis certain “Derivatum est” would come. VI. Then a mourner moveth pale In a silence full of wail, Raising not his sunken head Because he wandered last that way With that one beneath the clay: Weeping not, because that one, The only one who would have said “Cease to weep, beloved!” has gone Whence returneth comfort none. The silence breaketh suddenly,— “Earth, I praise thee!” crieth he, “Thou hast a grave for also me.” VII. Ha, a poet! know him by The ecstasy-dilated eye, Not uncharged with tears that ran Upward from his heart of man; By the cheek, from hour to hour, Kindled bright or sunken wan With a sense of lonely power; By the brow uplifted higher Than others, for more low declining: By the lip which words of fire Overboiling have burned white While they gave the nations light: Ay, in every time and place Ye may know the poet's face By the shade or shining. VIII. 'Neath a golden cloud he stands, Spreading his impassioned hands. “O God's Earth!” he saith, “the sign From the Father-soul to mine Of all beauteous mysteries, Of all perfect images Which, divine in His divine, In my human only are Very excellent and fair! Think not, Earth, that I would raise Weary forehead in thy praise, (Weary, that I cannot go Farther from thy region low,) If were struck no richer meanings From thee than thyself. The leanings Of the close trees o'er the brim Of a sunshine-haunted stream Have a sound beneath their leaves, Not of wind, not of wind, Which the poet's voice achieves: The faint mountains, heaped behind, Have a falling on their tops, Not of dew, not of dew, Which the poet's fancy drops: Viewless things his eyes can view, Driftings of his dream do light All the skies by day and night, And the seas that deepest roll Carry murmurs of his soul. Earth, I praise thee! praise thou me! God perfecteth His creation With this recipient poet-passion, And makes the beautiful to be. I praise thee, O belovèd sign, From the God-soul unto mine! Praise me, that I cast on thee The cunning sweet interpretation, The help and glory and dilation Of mine immortality!” IX. There was silence. None did dare To use again the spoken air Of that far-charming voice, until A Christian resting on the hill, With a thoughtful smile subdued (Seeming learnt in solitude) Which a weeper might have viewed Without new tears, did softly say, And looked up unto heaven alway While he praised the Earth— “O Earth, I count the praises thou art worth, By thy waves that move aloud, By thy hills against the cloud, By thy valleys warm and green, By the copses' elms between, By their birds which, like a sprite Scattered by a strong delight Into fragments musical, Stir and sing in every bush; By thy silver founts that fall, As if to entice the stars at night To thine heart; by grass and rush, And little weeds the children pull, Mistook for flowers! —Oh, beautiful Art thou, Earth, albeit worse Than in heaven is callèd good! Good to us, that we may know Meekly from thy good to go; While the holy, crying Blood Puts its music kind and low 'Twixt such ears as are not dull, And thine ancient curse! X. “Praisèd be the mosses soft In thy forest pathways oft, And the thorns, which make us think Of the thornless river-brink Where the ransomed tread: Praisèd be thy sunny gleams, And the storm, that worketh dreams Of calm unfinishèd: Praisèd be thine active days, And thy night-time's solemn need, When in God's dear book we read No night shall be therein: Praisèd be thy dwellings warm By household faggot's cheerful blaze, Where, to hear of pardoned sin, Pauseth oft the merry din, Save the babe's upon the arm Who croweth to the crackling wood: Yea, and, better understood, Praisèd be thy dwellings cold, Hid beneath the churchyard mould, Where the bodies of the saints Separate from earthly taints Lie asleep, in blessing bound, Waiting for the trumpet's sound To free them into blessing;—none Weeping more beneath the sun, Though dangerous words of human love Be graven very near, above. XI. “Earth, we Christians praise thee thus, Even for the change that comes With a grief from thee to us: For thy cradles and thy tombs, For the pleasant corn and wine And summer-heat; and also for The frost upon the sycamore And hail upon the vine!” THE VIRGIN MARY TO THE CHILD JESUS. “But see the Virgin blest Hath laid her babe to rest.” —Milton's Hymn on the Nativity. I. Sleep, sleep, mine Holy One! My flesh, my Lord!—what name? I do not know A name that seemeth not too high or low, Too far from me or heaven: My Jesus, that is best! that word being given By the majestic angel whose command Was softly as a man's beseeching said, When I and all the earth appeared to stand In the great overflow Of light celestial from his wings and head. Sleep, sleep, my saving One! II. And art Thou come for saving, baby-browed And speechless Being—art Thou come for saving? The palm that grows beside our door is bowed By treadings of the low wind from the south, A restless shadow through the chamber waving: Upon its bough a bird sings in the sun, But Thou, with that close slumber on Thy mouth, Dost seem of wind and sun already weary. Art come for saving, O my weary One? III. Perchance this sleep that shutteth out the dreary Earth-sounds and motions, opens on Thy soul High dreams on fire with God; High songs that make the pathways where they roll More bright than stars do theirs; and visions new Of Thine eternal Nature's old abode. Suffer this mother's kiss, Best thing that earthly is, To glide the music and the glory through, Nor narrow in Thy dream the broad upliftings Of any seraph wing. Thus noiseless, thus. Sleep, sleep, my dreaming One! IV. The slumber of His lips meseems to run Through my lips to mine heart, to all its shiftings Of sensual life, bringing contrariousness In a great calm. I feel I could lie down As Moses did, and die, It is a Jewish tradition that Moses died of the kisses of God's lips.—and then live most. I am 'ware of you, heavenly Presences, That stand with your peculiar light unlost, Each forehead with a high thought for a crown, Unsunned i' the sunshine! I am 'ware. Ye throw No shade against the wall! How motionless Ye round me with your living statuary, While through your whiteness, in and outwardly, Continual thoughts of God appear to go, Like light's soul in itself. I bear, I bear To look upon the dropt lids of your eyes, Though their external shining testifies To that beatitude within which were Enough to blast an eagle at his sun: I fall not on my sad clay face before ye,— I look on His. I know My spirit which dilateth with the woe Of His mortality, May well contain your glory. Yea, drop your lids more low. Ye are but fellow-worshippers with me! Sleep, sleep, my worshipped One! V. We sate among the stalls at Bethlehem; The dumb kine from their fodder turning them, Softened their hornèd faces To almost human gazes Toward the newly Born: The simple shepherds from the star-lit brooks Brought visionary looks, As yet in their astonied hearing rung The strange sweet angel-tongue: The magi of the East, in sandals worn, Knelt reverent, sweeping round, With long pale beards, their gifts upon the ground, The incense, myrrh and gold These baby hands were impotent to hold: So let all earthlies and celestials wait Upon Thy royal state. Sleep, sleep, my kingly One! VI. I am not proud—meek angels, ye invest New meeknesses to hear such utterance rest On mortal lips,—“I am not proud”—not proud! Albeit in my flesh God sent His Son, Albeit over Him my head is bowed As others bow before Him, still mine heart Bows lower than their knees. O centuries That roll in vision your futurities My future grave athwart,— Whose murmurs seem to reach me while I keep Watch o'er this sleep,— Say of me as the Heavenly said—“Thou art The blessedest of women!”—blessedest, Not holiest, not noblest, no high name Whose height misplaced may pierce me like a shame When I sit meek in heaven! For me, for me, God knows that I am feeble like the rest! I often wandered forth, more child than maiden Among the midnight hills of Galilee Whose summits looked heaven-laden, Listening to silence as it seemed to be God's voice, so soft yet strong, so fain to press Upon my heart as heaven did on the height, And waken up its shadows by a light, And show its vileness by a holiness. Then I knelt down most silent like the night, Too self-renounced for fears, Raising my small face to the boundless blue Whose stars did mix and tremble in my tears: God heard them falling after, with His dew. VII. So, seeing my corruption, can I see This Incorruptible now born of me, This fair new Innocence no sun did chance To shine on, (for even Adam was no child,) Created from my nature all defiled, This mystery, from out mine ignorance,— Nor feel the blindness, stain corruption more Than others do, or I did heretofore? Can hands wherein such burden pure has been, Not open with the cry “unclean, unclean,” More oft than any else beneath the skies? Ah King, ah Christ, ah son! The kine, the shepherds, the abasèd wise Must all less lowly wait Than I, upon Thy state. Sleep, sleep, my kingly One! VIII. Art Thou a King, then? Come, His universe, Come, crown me Him a King! Pluck rays from all such stars as never fling Their light where fell a curse, And make a crowning for this kingly brow!— What is my word? Each empyreal star Sits in a sphere afar In shining ambuscade: The child-brow, crowned by none, Keeps its unchildlike shade. Sleep, sleep, my crownless One! IX. Unchildlike shade! No other babe doth wear An aspect very sorrowful, as Thou. No small babe-smiles my watching heart has seen To float like speech the speechless lips between, No dovelike cooing in the golden air, No quick short joys of leaping babyhood. Alas, our earthly good In heaven thought evil, seems too good for Thee: Yet, sleep, my weary One! X. And then the drear sharp tongue of prophecy, With the dread sense of things which shall be done, Doth smite me inly, like a sword: a sword? That “smites the Shepherd.” Then, I think aloud The words “despised,”—“rejected,”—every word Recoiling into darkness as I view The Darling on my knee. Brightangels,—move not—lest ye stir the cloud Betwixt my soul and His futurity! I must not die, with mother's work to do, And could not live—and see. XI. It is enough to bear This image still and fair, This holier in sleep Than a saint at prayer, This aspect of a child Who never sinned or smiled; This Presence in an infant's face; This sadness most like love, This love than love more deep, This weakness like omnipotence It is so strong to move. Awful is this watching place, Awful what I see from hence— A king, without regalia, A God, without the thunder, A child, without the heart for play; Ay, a Creator, rent asunder From His first glory and cast away On His own world, for me alone To hold in hands created, crying—Son! XII. That tear fell not on Thee, Beloved, yet thou stirrest in thy slumber! Thou, stirring not for glad sounds out of number Which through the vibratory palm-trees run From summer-wind and bird, So quickly hast thou heard A tear fall silently? Wak'st thou, O loving One?— TO BETTINE, THE CHILD-FRIEND OF GOETHE. “I have the second sight, Goethe!” —Letters of a Child. I Bettine, friend of Goethe, Hadst thou the second sight— Upturning worship and delight With such a loving duty To his grand face, as women will, The childhood 'neath thine eyelids still? II —Before his shrine to doom thee, Using the same child's smile That heaven and earth, beheld erewhile For the first time, won from thee Ere star and flower grew dim and dead Save at his feet and o'er his head? III —Digging thine heart and throwing Away its childhood's gold, That so its woman-depth might hold His spirit's overflowing? (For surging souls, no worlds can bound, Their channel in the heart have found.) IV O child, to change appointed, Thou hadst not second sight! What eyes the future view aright Unless by tears anointed? Yea, only tears themselves can show The burning ones that have to flow. V O woman, deeply loving, Thou hadst not second sight! The star is very high and bright, And none can see it moving. Love looks around, below, above, Yet all his prophecy is—love. VI The bird thy childhood's playing Sent onward o'er the sea, Thy dove of hope came back to thee Without a leaf: art laying Its wet cold wing no sun can dry, Still in thy bosom secretly? VII Our Goethe's friend, Bettine, I have the second sight! The stone upon his grave is white, The funeral stone between ye; And in thy mirror thou hast viewed Some change as hardly understood. VIII Where's childhood? where is Goethe? The tears are in thine eyes. Nay, thou shalt yet reorganize Thy maidenhood of beauty In his own glory, which is smooth Of wrinkles and sublime in youth. IX The poet's arms have wound thee, He breathes upon thy brow, He lifts thee upward in the glow Of his great genius round thee,— The childlike poet undefiled Preserving evermore The Child. FELICIA HEMANS. TO L. E. L., REFERRING TO HER MONODY ON THE POETESS. I Thou bay-crowned living One that o'er the bay-crowned Dead art bowing, And o'er the shadeless moveless brow the vital shadow throwing, And o'er the sighless songless lips the wail and music wedding, And dropping o'er the tranquil eyes the tears not of their shedding!— II Take music from the silent Dead whose meaning is completer, Reserve thy tears for living brows where all such tears are meeter, And leave the violets in the grass to brighten where thou treadest, No flowers for her! no need of flowers, albeit “bring flowers!” thou saidest. III Yes, flowers, to crown the “cup and lute,” since both may come to breaking, Or flowers, to greet the “bride”—the heart's own beating works its aching; Or flowers, to soothe the “captive's” sight, from earth's free bosom gathered, Reminding of his earthly hope, then withering as it withered: IV But bring not near the solemn corse a type of human seeming, Lay only dust's stern verity upon the dust undreaming: And while the calm perpetual stars shall look upon it solely, Her spherèd soul shall look on them with eyes more bright and holy. V Nor mourn, O living One, because her part in life was mourning: Would she have lost the poet's fire for anguish of the burning? The minstrel harp, for the strained string? the tripod, for the afflated Woe? or the vision, for those tears in which it shone dilated? VI Perhaps she shuddered while the world's cold hand her brow was wreathing, But never wronged that mystic breath which breathed in all her breathing, Which drew, from rocky earth and man, abstractions high and moving, Beauty, if not the beautiful, and love, if not the loving. VII Such visionings have paled in sight; the Saviour she descrieth, And little recks who wreathed the brow which on His bosom lieth: The whiteness of His innocence o'er all her garments, flowing, There learneth she the sweet “new song” she will not mourn in knowing. VIII Be happy, crowned and living One! and as thy dust decayeth May thine own England say for thee what now for Her it sayeth— “Albeit softly in our ears her silver song was ringing, The foot-fall of her parting soul is softer than her singing.” MEMORY AND HOPE. I Back-looking Memory And prophet Hope both sprang from out the ground; One, where the flashing of cherubic sword Fell sad in Eden's ward, And one, from Eden earth within the sound Of the four rivers lapsing pleasantly, What time the promise after curse was said, “Thy seed shall bruise his head.” II Poor Memory's brain is wild, As moonstruck by that flaming atmosphere When she was born; her deep eyes shine and shone With light that conquereth sun And stars to wanner paleness year by year: With odorous gums she mixeth things defiled, She trampleth down earth's grasses green and sweet With her far-wandering feet. III She plucketh many flowers, Their beauty on her bosom's coldness killing; She teacheth every melancholy sound To winds and waters round; She droppeth tears with seed where man is tilling The rugged soil in his exhausted hours; She smileth—ah me! in her smile doth go A mood of deeper woe. IV Hope tripped on out of sight, Crowned with an Eden wreath she saw not wither, And went a-nodding through the wilderness With brow that shone no less Than a sea-gull's wing, brought nearer by rough weather, Searching the treeless rock for fruits of light; Her fair quick feet being armed from stones and cold By slippers of pure gold. V Memory did Hope much wrong And, while she dreamed, her slippers stole away; But still she wended on with mirth unheeding, Although her feet were bleeding, Till Memory tracked her on a certain day, And with most evil eyes did search her long And cruelly, whereat she sank to ground In a stark deadly swound. VI And so my Hope were slain, Had it not been that thou was standing near— Oh Thou who saidest “Live,” to creatures lying In their own blood and dying! For Thou her forehead to Thine heart didst rear And make its silent pulses sing again, Pouring a new light o'er her darkened eyne With tender tears from Thine. VII Therefore my Hope arose From out her swound and gazed upon Thy face, And, meeting there that soft subduing look Which Peter's spirit shook, Sank downward in a rapture to embrace Thy piercèd hands and feet with kisses close, And prayed Thee to assist her evermore To “reach the things before.” THE SLEEP. “He giveth His beloved sleep.” —Psalm cxxvii. 2. I Of all the thoughts of God that are Borne inward into souls afar, Along the Psalmist's music deep, Now tell me if that any is, For gift or grace, surpassing this: “He giveth His belovèd—sleep?” II What would we give to our beloved? The hero's heart to be unmoved, The poet's star-tuned harp to sweep, The patriot's voice to teach and rouse, The monarch's crown to light the brows? He giveth His belovèd—sleep. III What do we give to our beloved? A little faith all undisproved, A little dust to overweep, And bitter memories to make The whole earth blasted for our sake: He giveth his belovèd—sleep. IV “Sleep soft, beloved!” we sometimes say, Who have no tune to charm away Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep: But never doleful dream again Shall break the happy slumber when He giveth His belovèd—sleep. V O earth, so full of dreary noises! O men, with wailing in your voices! O delvèd gold, the wailers heap! O strife, O curse, that o'er it fall! God strikes a silence through you all, And giveth His belovèd—sleep. VI His dews drop mutely on the hill, His cloud above it saileth still, Though on its slope men sow and reap: More softly than the dew is shed, Or cloud is floated overhead, He giveth His belovèd—sleep. VII Ay, men may wonder while they scan A living, thinking, feeling man Confirmed in such a rest to keep; But angels say, and through the word I think their happy smile is heard— “He giveth His belovèd—sleep.” VIII For me, my heart that erst did go Most like a tired child at a show, That sees through tears the mummers leap, Would now its wearied vision close, Would childlike on His love repose Who giveth His belovèd—sleep. IX And friends, dear friends, when it shall be That this low breath is gone from me, And round my bier ye come to weep, Let One, most loving of you all, Say “Not a tear must o'er her fall! “He giveth His belovèd sleep.” MAN AND NATURE. A sad man on a summer day Did look upon the earth and say— “Purple cloud the hill-top binding; Folded hills the valleys wind in; Valleys with fresh streams among you; Streams with bosky trees along you; Trees with many birds and blossoms; Birds with music-trembling bosoms; Blossoms dropping dews that wreathe you To your fellow flowers beneath you; Flowers that constellate on earth; Earth that shakest to the mirth Of the merry Titan Ocean, All his shining hair in motion! Why am I thus the only one Who can be dark beneath the sun?” But when the summer day was past, He looked to heaven and smiled at last, Self-answered so— “Because, O cloud, Pressing with thy crumpled shroud Heavily on mountain top,— Hills that almost seem to drop Stricken with a misty death To the valleys underneath,— Valleys sighing with the torrent,— Waters streaked with branches horrent,— Branchless trees that shake your head Wildly o'er your blossoms spread Where the common flowers are found,— Flowers with foreheads to the ground,— Ground that shriekest while the sea With his iron smiteth thee— I am, besides, the only one Who can be bright without the sun.” A SEA-SIDE WALK. I We walked beside the sea After a day which perished silently Of its own glory—like the princess weird Who, combating the Genius, scorched and seared, Uttered with burning breath, “Ho! victory!” And sank adown, a heap of ashes pale: So runs the Arab tale. II The sky above us showed A universal and unmoving cloud On which the cliffs permitted us to see Only the outline of their majesty, As master-minds when gazed at by the crowd: And shining with a gloom, the water grey Swang in its moon-taught way. III Nor moon, nor stars were out; They did not dare to tread so soon about, Though trembling, in the footsteps of the sun: The light was neither night's nor day's, but one Which, life-like, had a beauty in its doubt, And silence's impassioned breathings round Seemed wandering into sound. IV O solemn-beating heart Of nature! I have knowledge that thou art Bound unto man's by cords he cannot sever; And, what time they are slackened by him ever, So to attest his own supernal part, Still runneth thy vibration fast and strong The slackened cord along: V For though we never spoke Of the grey water and the shaded rock, Dark wave and stone unconsciously were fused Into the plaintive speaking that we used Of absent friends and memories unforsook; And, had we seen each other's face, we had Seen haply each was sad. THE SEA-MEW. AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED TO M. E. H. I How joyously the young sea-mew Lay dreaming on the waters blue Whereon our little bark had thrown A little shade, the only one, But shadows ever man pursue. II Familiar with the waves and free As if their own white foam were he, His heart upon the heart of ocean Lay learning all its mystic motion, And throbbing to the throbbing sea. III And such a brightness in his eye As if the ocean and the sky Within him had lit up and nurst A soul God gave him not at first, To comprehend their majesty. IV We were not cruel, yet did sunder His white wing from the blue waves under, And bound it, while his fearless eyes Shone up to ours in calm surprise, As deeming us some ocean wonder. V We bore our ocean bird unto A grassy place where he might view The flowers that curtsey to the bees, The waving of the tall green trees, The falling of the silver dew. VI But flowers of earth were pale to him Who had seen the rainbow fishes swim; And when earth's dew around him lay He thought of ocean's wingèd spray, And his eye waxèd sad and dim. VII The green trees round him only made A prison with their darksome shade; And drooped his wing, and mournèd he For his own boundless glittering sea— Albeit he knew not they could fade. VIII Then One her gladsome face did bring, Her gentle voice's murmuring, In ocean's stead his heart to move And teach him what was human love: He thought it a strange, mournful thing. IX He lay down in his grief to die, (First looking to the sea-like sky That hath no waves) because, alas! Our human touch did on him pass, And, with our touch, our agony. THE LITTLE FRIEND. WRITTEN IN THE BOOK WHICH SHE MADE AND SENT TO ME. “? ?? ?? ??? ?? ???????? ??????????.” —Marcus Antoninus. The book thou givest, dear as such, Shall bear thy dearer name; And many a word the leaves shall touch, For thee who form'dst the same! And on them, many a thought shall grow 'Neath memory's rain and sun, Of thee, glad child, who dost not know That thought and pain are one! Yes! thoughts of thee, who satest oft, A while since, at my side— So wild to tame,—to move so soft, So very hard to chide: The childish vision at thine heart, The lesson on the knee; The wandering looks which would depart, Like gulls, across the sea! The laughter, which no half-belief In wrath could all suppress: The falling tears, which looked like grief, And were but gentleness: The fancies sent, for bliss, abroad, As Eden's were not done— Mistaking still the cherub's sword For shining of the sun! The sportive speech with wisdom in't— The question strange and bold— The childish fingers in the print Of God's creative hold: The praying words in whispers said, The sin with sobs confest; The leaning of the young meek head Upon the Saviour's breast! The gentle consciousness of praise, With hues that went and came; The brighter blush, a word could raise, Were that—a father's name! The shadow on thy smile for each That on his face could fall! So quick hath love been, thee to teach, What soon it teacheth all. Sit still as erst beside his feet! The future days are dim,— But those will seem to thee most sweet Which keep thee nearest him! Sit at his feet in quiet mirth, And let him see arise A clearer sun and greener earth Within thy loving eyes!— Ah, loving eyes! that used to lift Your childhood to my face— That leave a memory on the gift I look on in your place— May bright-eyed hosts your guardians be From all but thankful tears,— While, brightly as you turn on me Ye meet th' advancing years! MY DOVES. “O Weisheit! Du red'st wie eine Taube!” —Goethe. My little doves have left a nest Upon an Indian tree Whose leaves fantastic take their rest Or motion from the sea; For, ever there the sea-winds go With sunlit paces to and fro. The tropic flowers looked up to it, The tropic stars looked down, And there my little doves did sit With feathers softly brown, And glittering eyes that showed their right To general Nature's deep delight. And God them taught, at every close Of murmuring waves beyond And green leaves round, to interpose Their choral voices fond, Interpreting that love must be The meaning of the earth and sea. Fit ministers! Of living loves Theirs hath the calmest fashion, Their living voice the likest moves To lifeless intonation, The lovely monotone of springs And winds and such insensate things. My little doves were ta'en away From that glad nest of theirs Across an ocean rolling grey And tempest-clouded airs: My little doves, who lately knew The sky and wave by warmth and blue. And now, within the city prison, In mist and chillness pent, With sudden upward look they listen For sounds of past content, For lapse of water, swell of breeze, Or nut-fruit falling from the trees. The stir without the glow of passion, The triumph of the mart, The gold and silver as they clash on Man's cold metallic heart, The roar of wheels, the cry for bread,— These only sounds are heard instead. Yet still, as on my human hand Their fearless heads they lean, And almost seem to understand What human musings mean, (Their eyes with such a plaintive shine Are fastened upwardly to mine!)— Soft falls their chant as on the nest Beneath the sunny zone; For love that stirred it in their breast Has not aweary grown, And 'neath the city's shade can keep The well of music clear and deep. And love, that keeps the music, fills With pastoral memories; All echoings from out the hills, All droppings from the skies, All flowings from the wave and wind, Remembered in their chant, I find. So teach ye me the wisest part, My little doves! to move Along the city-ways with heart Assured by holy love, And vocal with such songs as own A fountain to the world unknown. 'Twas hard to sing by Babel's stream— More hard, in Babel's street: But if the soulless creatures deem Their music not unmeet For sunless walls—let us begin, Who wear immortal wings within! To me, fair memories belong Of scenes that used to bless, For no regret, but present song And lasting thankfulness, And very soon to break away, Like types, in purer things than they. I will have hopes that cannot fade, For flowers the valley yields; I will have humble thoughts instead Of silent, dewy fields: My spirit and my God shall be My seaward hill, my boundless sea. TO MARY RUSSELL MITFORD IN HER GARDEN. What time I lay these rhymes anear thy feet, Benignant friend, I will not proudly say As better poets use, “These flowers I lay,” Because I would not wrong thy roses sweet, Blaspheming so their name. And yet, repeat Thou, overleaning them this springtime day, With heart as open to love as theirs to May, —“Low-rooted verse may reach some heavenly heat, Even like my blossoms, if as nature-true Though not as precious.” Thou art unperplext— Dear friend, in whose dear writings drops the dew And blow the natural airs,—thou, who art next To nature's self in cheering the world's view,— To preach a sermon on so known a text! THE STUDENT. “?? ??? ????? ???? ??? ??? ????? ???? ??? ???? ??? ?????????, ???? ???? ??? ?????, ?? ? ???????.” —Marcus Antoninus. “My midnight lamp is weary as my soul, And, being unimmortal, has gone out. And now alone yon moony lamp of heaven, Which God lit and not man, illuminates These volumes, others wrote in weariness As I have read them; and this cheek and brow, Whose paleness, burnèd in with heats of thought, Would make an angel smile to see how ill Clay thrust from Paradise consorts with mind— If angels could, like men, smile bitterly. “Yet, must my brow be paler! I have vowed To clip it with the crown which cannot fade, When it is faded. Not in vain ye cry, O glorious voices that survive the tongues From whence was drawn your separate sovereignty— For I would reign beside you! I would melt The golden treasures of my health and life Into that name! My lips are vowed apart From cheerful words; mine ears, from pleasant sounds; Mine eyes, from sights God made so beautiful,— My feet, from wanderings under shady trees; Mine hands, from clasping of dear-loving friends,— My very heart, from feelings which move soft! Vowed am I from the day's delightsomeness, And dreams of night! and when the house is dumb In sleep, which is the pause 'twixt life and life, I live and waken thus; and pluck away Slumber's sleek poppies from my painèd lids— Goading my mind with thongs wrought by herself, To toil and struggle along this mountain-path Which hath no mountain-airs; until she sweat Like Adam's brow, and gasp, and rend away In agony, her garment of the flesh!” And so his midnight lamp was lit anew, And burned till morning. But his lamp of life Till morning burned not! He was found embraced, Close, cold, and stiff, by Death's compelling sleep; His breast and brow supported on a page Charàctered over with a praise of fame, Of its divineness and beatitude— Words which had often caused that heart to throb, That cheek to burn; though silent lay they now, Without a single beating in the pulse, And all the fever gone! I saw a bay Spring verdant from a newly-fashioned grave. The grass upon the grave was verdanter, That being watered by the eyes of One Who bore not to look up toward the tree! Others looked on it—some, with passing glance, Because the light wind stirrèd in its leaves; And some, with sudden lighting of the soul In admiration's ecstasy!—Ay! some Did wag their heads like oracles, and say, “'Tis very well!”—but none rememberèd The heart which housed the root, except that One. Whose sight was lost in weeping! Is it thus, Ambition, idol of the intellect? Shall we drink aconite, alone to use Thy golden bowl? and sleep ourselves to death— To dream thy visions about life? O Power That art a very feebleness!—before Thy clayey feet we bend our knees of clay, And round thy senseless brow bind diadems With paralytic hands, and shout “a god,” With voices mortal hoarse! Who can discern Th' infirmities they share in? Being blind, We cannot see thy blindness: being weak, We cannot feel thy weakness: being low, We cannot mete thy baseness: being unwise, We cannot understand thy idiocy! THE EXILE'S RETURN. I When from thee, weeping I removed, And from my land for years, I thought not to return, Beloved, With those same parting tears. I come again to hill and lea, Weeping for thee. II I clasped thine hand when standing last Upon the shore in sight. The land is green, the ship is fast, I shall be there to-night. I shall be there—no longer we— No more with thee! III Had I beheld thee dead and still, I might more clearly know How heart of thine could turn as chill As hearts by nature so; How change could touch the falsehood-free And changeless thee. IV But, now thy fervid looks last-seen Within my soul remain, 'Tis hard to think that they have been, To be no more again— That I shall vainly wait, ah me! A word from thee. V I could not bear to look upon That mound of funeral clay Where one sweet voice is silence—one Æthereal brow, decay; Where all thy mortal I may see, But never thee. VI For thou art where all friends are gone Whose parting pain is o'er; And I, who love and weep alone, Where thou wilt weep no more, Weep bitterly and selfishly For me, not thee. VII I know, Beloved, thou canst not know That I endure this pain; For saints in heaven, the Scriptures show, Can never grieve again: And grief known mine, even there, would be Still shared by thee. A SONG AGAINST SINGING. TO E. J. H. I They bid me sing to thee, Thou golden-haired and silver-voicèd child— With lips by no worse sigh than sleep's defiled— With eyes unknowing how tears dim the sight, And feet all trembling at the new delight Treaders of earth to be! II Ah no! the lark may bring A song to thee from out the morning cloud, The merry river from its lilies bowed, The brisk rain from the trees, the lucky wind That half doth make its music, half doth find,— But I—I may not sing. III How could I think it right, New-comer on our earth as, Sweet, thou art, To bring a verse from out a human heart Made heavy with accumulated tears, And cross with such amount of weary years Thy day-sum of delight? IV Even if the verse were said, Thou—who wouldst clap thy tiny hands to hear The wind or rain, gay bird or river clear— Wouldst, at that sound of sad humanities, Upturn thy bright uncomprehending eyes And bid me play instead. V Therefore no song of mine,— But prayer in place of singing; prayer that would Commend thee to the new-creating God Whose gift is childhood's heart without its stain Of weakness, ignorance, and changing vain— That gift of God be thine! VI So wilt thou aye be young, In lovelier childhood than thy shining brow And pretty winning accents make thee now: Yea, sweeter than this scarce articulate sound (How sweet!) of “father,” “mother,” shall be found The Abba on thy tongue. VII And so, as years shall chase Each other's shadows, thou wilt less resemble Thy fellows of the earth who toil and tremble, Than him thou seèst not, thine angel bold Yet meek, whose ever-lifted eyes behold The Ever-loving's face. STANZAS. [I may sing; but minstrel's singing] I may sing; but minstrel's singing Ever ceaseth with his playing. I may smile; but time is bringing Thoughts for smiles to wear away in. I may view thee, mutely loving; But shall view thee so in dying! I may sigh; but life's removing, And with breathing endeth sighing! Be it so! When no song of mine comes near thee, Will its memory fail to soften? When no smile of mine can cheer thee, Will thy smile be used as often? When my looks the darkness boundeth, Will thine own be lighted after? When my sigh no longer soundeth, Wilt thou list another's laughter? Be it so! THE YOUNG QUEEN. “This awful responsibility is imposed upon me so suddenly and at so early a period of my life, that I should feel myself utterly oppressed by the burden, were I not sustained by the hope that Divine Providence, which has called me to this work, will give me strength for the performance of it.” —The Queen's Declaration in Council. The shroud is yet unspread To wrap our crownèd dead; His soul hath scarcely hearkened for the thrilling word of doom; And Death, that makes serene Ev'n brows where crowns have been, Hath scarcely time to meeten his for silence of the tomb. St. Paul's king-dirging note The city's heart hath smote— The city's heart is struck with thought more solemn than the tone! A shadow sweeps apace Before the nation's face, Confusing in a shapeless blot the sepulchre and throne. The palace sounds with wail— The courtly dames are pale— A widow o'er the purple bows, and weeps its splendour dim: And we who hold the boon, A king for freedom won, Do feel eternity rise up between our thanks and him. And while all things express All glory's nothingness, A royal maiden treadeth firm where that departed trod! The deathly scented crown Weighs her shining ringlets down; But calm she lifts her trusting face, and calleth upon God. Her thoughts are deep within her: No outward pageants win her From memories that in her soul are rolling wave on wave— Her palace walls enring The dust that was a king— And very cold beneath her feet, she feels her father's grave. And One, as fair as she, Can scarce forgotten be,— Who clasped a little infant dead, for all a kingdom's worth! The mournèd, blessèd One, Who views Jehovah's throne, Aye smiling to the angels, that she lost a throne on earth. Perhaps our youthful Queen Remembers what has been— Her childhood's rest by loving heart, and sport on grassy sod— Alas! can others wear A mother's heart for her? But calm she lifts her trusting face, and calleth upon God. Yea! call on God, thou maiden Of spirit nobly laden, And leave such happy days behind, for happy-making years! A nation looks to thee For steadfast sympathy: Make room within thy bright clear eyes for all its gathered tears. And so the grateful isles Shall give thee back their smiles, And as thy mother joys in thee, in them shalt thou rejoice; Rejoice to meekly bow A somewhat paler brow, While the King of kings shall bless thee by the British people's voice! VICTORIA'S TEARS. “Hark! the reiterated clangour sounds! Now murmurs, like the sea or like the storm, Or like the flames on forests, move and mount From rank to rank, and loud and louder roll, Till all the people is one vast applause.” —Landor's Gebir. “O maiden! heir of kings! A king has left his place! The majesty of Death has swept All other from his face! And thou upon thy mother's breast No longer lean adown, But take the glory for the rest, And rule the land that loves thee best!” She heard, and wept— She wept, to wear a crown! They decked her courtly halls; They reined her hundred steeds; They shouted at her palace gate, “A noble Queen succeeds!” Her name has stirred the mountain's sleep, Her praise has filled the town! And mourners God had stricken deep, Looked hearkening up, and did not weep. Alone she wept, Who wept, to wear a crown! She saw no purples shine, For tears had dimmed her eyes; She only knew her childhood's flowers Were happier pageantries! And while her heralds played the part, For million shouts to drown— “God save the Queen” from hill to mart,— She heard through all her beating heart, And turned and wept— She wept, to wear a crown! God save thee, weeping Queen! Thou shalt be well beloved! The tyrant's sceptre cannot move, As those pure tears have moved! The nature in thine eyes we see, That tyrants cannot own— The love that guardeth liberties! Strange blessing on the nation lies, Whose Sovereign wept— Yea! wept, to wear its crown! God bless thee, weeping Queen, With blessing more divine! And fill-with happier love than earth's, That tender heart of thine! That when the thrones of earth shall be As low as graves brought down; A piercèd Hand may give to thee The crown which angels shout to see! Thou wilt not weep, To wear that heavenly crown! VANITIES. “From fading things, fond men, lift your desire.” —Drummond. Could ye be very blest in hearkening Youth's often danced-to melodies— Hearing it piped, the midnight darkening Doth come to show the starry skies,— To freshen garden-flowers, the rain?— It is in vain, it is in vain! Could ye be very blest in urging A captive nation's strength to thunder Out into foam, and with its surging The Xerxean fetters break asunder? The storm is cruel as the chain!— It is in vain, it is in vain! Could ye be very blest in paling Your brows with studious nights and days, When like your lamps your life is fading, And sighs, not breath, are wrought from praise? Your tombs, not ye, that praise retain— It is in vain, it is in vain! Yea! but ye could be very blest, If some ye nearest love were nearest! Must they not love when lovèd best? Must ye not happiest love when dearest? Alas! how hard to feel again,— It is in vain, it is in vain! For those ye love are not unsighing— They are unchanging least of all: And ye the loved—ah! no denying, Will leave your lips beneath the pall, When passioned ones have o'er it sain “It is in vain, it is in vain!” BEREAVEMENT. When some Beloveds, 'neath whose eyelids lay The sweet lights of my childhood, one by one Did leave me dark before the natural sun, And I astonied fell and could not pray,— A thought within me to myself did say, “Is God less God, that thou art left undone? Rise, worship, bless Him, in this sack cloth spun, As in that purple!”—But I answered Nay! What child his filial heart in words can loose If he behold his tender father raise The hand that chastens sorely? can he choose But sob in silence with an upward gaze?— And my great Father, thinking fit to bruise, Discerns in speechless tears both prayer and praise. CONSOLATION. All are not taken; there are left behind Living Beloveds, tender looks to bring And make the daylight still a happy thing, And tender voices, to make soft the wind: But if it were not so—if I could find No love in all the world for comforting, Nor any path but hollowly did ring Where “dust to dust” the love from life disjoined, And if, before those sepulchres unmoving I stood alone, (as some forsaken lamb Goes bleating up the moors in weary dearth,) Crying “Where are ye, O my loved and loving?”— I know a Voice would sound, “Daughter, I am. Can I suffice for Heaven and not for earth?” A SUPPLICATION FOR LOVE. HYMN I. “The Lord Jesus, although gone to the Father, and we see Him no more, is still present with His Church; and in His heavenly glory expends upon her as intense a love, as in the agony of the garden, and the crucifixion of the tree. Those eyes that wept, still gaze upon her.” —Recalled words of an extempore Discourse, preached at Sidmouth, 1833. God, namèd Love, whose fount Thou art, Thy crownless Church before Thee stands, With too much hating in her heart, And too much striving in her hands! O loving Lord! O slain for love! Thy blood upon Thy garments came— Inwrap their folds our brows above, Before we tell Thee all our shame! “Love as I loved you,” was the sound That on Thy lips expiring sate! Sweet words, in bitter strivings drowned! We hated as the worldly hate. The spear that pierced for love Thy side, We dared for wrathful use to crave; And with our cruel noise denied Its silence to Thy blood-red grave! Ah, blood! that speaketh more of love Than Abel's—could we speak like Cain, And grieve and scare that holy Dove, The parting love-gift of the Slain? Yet, Lord, Thy wrongèd love fulfil! Thy Church, though fallen, before Thee stands— Behold, the voice is Jacob's still, Albeit the hands are Esau's hands! Hast Thou no tears, like those besprent Upon Thy Zion's ancient part? No moving looks, like those which sent Their softness through a traitor's heart? No touching tale of anguish dear; Whereby like children we may creep, All trembling, to each other near, And view each other's face, and weep? Oh, move us—Thou hast power to move— One in the one Beloved to be! Teach us the heights and depths of love— Give Thine—that we may love like Thee! THE MEDIATOR. HYMN II. “As the greatest of all sacrifices was required, we may be assured that no other would have sufficed.” —Boyd's Essay on the Atonement. How high Thou art! our songs can own No music Thou couldst stoop to hear! But still the Son's expiring groan Is vocal in the Father's ear. How pure Thou art! our hands are dyed With curses, red with murder's hue— But He hath stretched His hands to hide The sins that pierced them from Thy view. How strong Thou art! we tremble lest The thunders of Thine arm be moved— But He is lying on Thy breast, And Thou must clasp Thy best Beloved! How kind Thou art! Thou didst not choose To joy in Him for ever so; But that embrace Thou wilt not loose For vengeance, didst for love forego! High God, and pure, and strong, and kind! The low, the foul, the feeble, spare! Thy brightness in His face we find— Behold our darkness only there! THE WEEPING SAVIOUR. HYMN III. “? tell Whether His countenance can thee affright, Tears in His eyes quench the amazing light.” —Donne. When Jesus' friend had ceased to be, Still Jesus' heart its friendship kept— “Where have ye laid him?”—“Come and see!” But ere His eyes could see, they wept. Lord! not in sepulchres alone, Corruption's worm is rank and free; The shroud of death our bosoms own— The shades of sorrow! Come and see! Come, Lord! God's image cannot shine Where sin's funereal darkness lowers— Come! turn those weeping eyes of Thine Upon these sinning souls of ours! And let those eyes, with shepherd care, Their moving watch above us keep; Till love the strength of sorrow wear, And as Thou weepedst, we may weep! For surely we may weep to know, So dark and deep our spirit's stain; That had Thy blood refused to flow, Thy very tears had flowed in vain. THE MEASURE. HYMN IV. “He comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure” [HEBREW]. —Isaiah xl. “Thou givest them tears to drink in a measure” [HEBREW]. I believe that the word occurs in no other part of the Hebrew Scriptures. —Psalm lxxx. I God the Creator, with a pulseless hand Of unoriginated power, hath weighed The dust of earth and tears of man in one Measure, and by one weight: So saith His holy book. II Shall we, then, who have issued from the dust And there return,—shall we, who toil for dust, And wrap our winnings in this dusty life, Say “No more tears, Lord God! The measure runneth o'er”? III Oh, Holder of the balance, laughest Thou? Nay, Lord! be gentler to our foolishness, For His sake who assumed our dust and turns On Thee pathetic eyes Still moistened with our tears. IV And teach us, O our Father, while we weep, To look in patience upon earth and learn— Waiting, in that meek gesture, till at last These tearful eyes be filled With the dry dust of death. COWPER'S GRAVE. I It is a place where poets crowned may feel the heart's decaying; It is a place where happy saints may weep amid their praying; Yet let the grief and humbleness as low as silence languish: Earth surely now may give her calm to whom she gave her anguish. II O poets, from a maniac's tongue was poured the deathless singing! O Christians, at your cross of hope a hopeless hand was clinging! O men, this man in brotherhood your weary paths beguiling, Groaned inly while he taught you peace, and died while ye were smiling! III And now, what time ye all may read through dimming tears his story, How discord on the music fell and darkness on the glory, And how when, one by one, sweet sounds and wandering lights departed, He wore no less a loving face because so broken-hearted, IV He shall be strong to sanctify the poet's high vocation, And bow the meekest Christian down in meeker adoration; Nor ever shall he be, in praise, by wise or good forsaken, Named softly as the household name of one whom God hath taken. V With quiet sadness and no gloom I learn to think upon him, With meekness that is gratefulness to God whose heaven hath won him, Who suffered once the madness-cloud to His own love to blind him, But gently led the blind along where breath and bird could find him; VI And wrought within his shattered brain such quick poetic senses As hills have language for, and stars, harmonious influences: The pulse of dew upon the grass kept his within its number, And silent shadows from the trees refreshed him like a slumber. VII Wild timid hares were drawn from woods to share his home-caresses, Uplooking to his human eyes with sylvan tendernesses: The very world, by God's constraint, from falsehood's ways removing, Its women and its men became, beside him, true and loving. VIII And though, in blindness, he remained unconscious of that guiding, And things provided came without the sweet sense of providing, He testified this solemn truth, while phrenzy desolated, —Nor man nor nature satisfies whom only God created. IX Like a sick child that knoweth not his mother while she blesses And drops upon his burning brow the coolness of her kisses,— That turns his fevered eyes around—“My mother! where's my mother?”— As if such tender words and deeds could come from any other!— X The fever gone, with leaps of heart he sees her bending o'er him, Her face all pale from watchful love, the unweary love she bore him! Thus woke the poet from the dream his life's long fever gave him, Beneath those deep pathetic Eyes which closed in death to save him. XI Thus? oh, not thus! no type of earth can image that awaking, Wherein he scarcely heard the chant of seraphs, round him breaking, Or felt the new immortal throb of soul from body parted, But felt those eyes alone, and knew—“My Saviour! not deserted!” XII Deserted! Who hath dreamt that when the cross in darkness rested, Upon the Victim's hidden face no love was manifested? What frantic hands outstretched have e'er the atoning drops averted? What tears have washed them from the soul, that one should be deserted? XIII Deserted! God could separate from His own essence rather; And Adam's sins have swept between the righteous Son and Father: Yea, once, Immanuel's orphaned cry His universe hath shaken— It went up single, echoless, “My God, I am forsaken!” XIV It went up from the Holy's lips amid His lost creation, That, of the lost, no son should use those words of desolation! That earth's worst phrenzies, marring hope, should mar not hope's fruition, And I, on Cowper's grave, should see his rapture in a vision. THE WEAKEST THING. I Which is the weakest thing of all Mine heart can ponder? The sun, a little cloud can pall With darkness yonder? The cloud, a little wind can move Where'er it listeth? The wind, a little leaf above, Though sere, resisteth? II What time that yellow leaf was green, My days were gladder; But now, whatever Spring may mean, I must grow sadder. Ah me! a leaf with sighs can wring My lips asunder? Then is mine heart the weakest thing Itself can ponder. III Yet, Heart, when sun and cloud are pined And drop together, And at a blast which is not wind The forests wither, Thou, from the darkening deathly curse To glory breakest,— The Strongest of the universe Guarding the weakest! THE PET-NAME. ? the name Which from their lips seemed a caress.” —Miss Mitford's Dramatic Scenes. I I have a name, a little name, Uncadenced for the ear, Unhonoured by ancestral claim, Unsanctified by prayer and psalm The solemn font anear. II It never did to pages wove For gay romance belong; It never dedicate did move As “Sacharissa” unto love, “Orinda” unto song. III Though I write books, it will be read Upon the leaves of none, And afterward, when I am dead, Will ne'er be graved for sight or tread, Across my funeral-stone. IV This name, whoever chance to call, Perhaps your smile may win: Nay, do not smile! mine eyelids fall Over mine eyes and feel withal The sudden tears within. V Is there a leaf, that greenly grows Where summer meadows bloom, But gathereth the winter snows And changeth to the hue of those, If lasting till they come? VI Is there a word, or jest, or game, But time incrusteth round With sad associate thoughts the same? And so to me my very name Assumes a mournful sound. VII My brother gave that name to me When we were children twain, When names acquired baptismally Were hard to utter, as to see That life had any pain. VIII No shade was on us then, save one Of chestnuts from the hill; And through the word our laugh did run As part thereof: the mirth being done, He calls me by it still. IX Nay, do not smile! I hear in it What none of you can hear,— The talk upon the willow seat, The bird and wind that did repeat Around, our human cheer. X I hear the birthday's noisy bliss, My sisters' woodland glee, My father's praise I did not miss, When stooping down he cared to kiss The poet at his knee,— XI And voices which, to name me, aye Their tenderest tones were keeping— To some I never more can say An answer till God wipes away In heaven these drops of weeping. XII My name to me a sadness wears: No murmurs cross my mind— Now God be thanked for these thick tears Which show, of those departed years, Sweet memories left behind. XIII Now God be thanked for years enwrought With love which softens yet: Now God be thanked for every thought Which is so tender it has caught Earth's guerdon of regret. XIV Earth saddens, never shall remove Affections purely given; And e'en that mortal grief shall prove The immortality of love, And heighten it with Heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">QUEEN ANNELIDA AND FALSE ARCITE. MODERNISED FROM CHAUCER. 1841. QUEEN ANNELIDA AND FALSE ARCITE. I O thou fierce God of armies, Mars the red, Who in thy frosty country callèd Thrace, Within thy grisly temples full of dread, Art honoured as the patron of that place, With the Bellona Pallas, full of grace! Be present; guide, sustain this song of mine, Beginning which, I cry toward thy shrine. II For deep the hope is sunken in my mind, In piteous-hearted English to indite This story old, which I in Latin find, Of Queen Annelida and false Arcite: Since Time, whose rust can all things fret and bite, In fretting many a tale of equal fame, Hath from our memory nigh devoured this same. III Thy favour, Polyhymnia, also deign Who, in thy sisters' green Parnassian glade, By Helicon, not far from Cirrha's fane, Singest with voice memorial in the shade Under the laurel which can never fade; Now grant my ship, that some smooth haven win her! I follow Statius first, and then Corinna. IV When Theseus by a long and deathly war The hardy Scythian race had overcome, He, laurel-crownèd, in his gold-wrought car, Returning to his native city home, The blissful people for his pomp make room, And throw their shouts up to the stars, and bring The general heart out for his honouring. V Before the Duke, in sign of victory, The trumpets sound, and in his banner large Dilates the figure of Mars—and men may see, In token of glory, many a treasure charge, Many a bright helm, and many a spear and targe, Many a fresh knight, and many a blissful rout On horse and foot, in all the field about. VI Hippolyte, his wife, the heroic queen Of Scythia, conqueress though conquerèd, With Emily, her youthful sister sheen, Fair in a car of gold he with him led. The ground about her car she overspread With brightness from the beauty in her face, Which smiled forth largesses of love and grace. VII Thus triumphing, and laurel-crownèd thus, In all the flower of Fortune's high providing, I leave this noble prince, this Theseus, Toward the walls of Athens bravely riding,— And seek to bring in, without more abiding, Something of that whereof I 'gan to write Of fair Annelida and false Arcite. VIII Fierce Mars, who in his furious course of ire, The ancient wrath of Juno to fulfil, Had set the nations' mutual hearts on fire In Thebes and Argos, (so that each would kill Either with bloody spears,) grew never still— But rushed now here, now there, among them both, Till each was slain by each, they were so wroth. IX For when Parthenopæus and Tydeus Had perished with Hippomedon,—alsò Amphiaraus and proud Capaneus,— And when the wretched Theban brethren two Were slain, and King Adrastus home did go— So desolate stood Thebes, her halls so bare, That no man's love could remedy his care. X And when the old man, Creon, 'gan espy How darkly the blood royal was brought down, He held the city in his tyranny, And forced the nobles of that regiòn To be his friends and dwell within the town; Till half for love of him, and half for fear, Those princely persons yielded, and drew near,— XI Among the rest the young Armenian queen, Annelida, was in that city living. She was as beauteous as the sun was sheen, Her fame to distant lands such glory giving That all men in the world had some heart-striving To look on her. No woman, sooth, can be, Though earth is rich in fairness, fair as she. XII Young was this queen, but twenty summers old, Of middle stature, and such wondrous beauty, That Nature, self-delighted, did behold A rare work in her—while, in stedfast duty, Lucretia and Penelope would suit ye With a worse model—all things understood, She was, in short, most perfect fair and good. XIII The Theban knight eke, to give all their due, Was young, and therewithal a lusty knight. But he was double in love, and nothing true, Ay, subtler in that craft than any wight, And with his cunning won this lady bright; So working on her simpleness of nature, That she him trusted above every creature. XIV What shall I say? She lovèd Arcite so, That if at any hour he parted from her, Her heart seemed ready anon to burst in two; For he with lowliness had overcome her: She thought she knew the heart which did foredoom her. But he was false, and all that softness feigning,— I trow men need not learn such arts of paining. XV And ne'ertheless full mickle business Had he, before he might his lady win,— He swore that he should die of his distress, His brain would madden with the fire within! Alas, the while! for it was ruth and sin, That she, sweet soul, upon his grief should rue; But little reckon false hearts as the true. XVI And she to Arcite so subjected her, That all she did or had seemed his of right: No creature in her house met smile or cheer, Further than would be pleasant to Arcite; There was no lack whereby she did despite To his least will—for hers to his was bent, And all things which pleased him made her content. XVII No kind of letter to her fair hands came, Touching on love, from any kind of wight, But him she showed it ere she burned the same: So open was she, doing all she might, That nothing should be hidden from her knight, Lest he for any untruth should upbraid her,— The slave of his unspoken will she made her. XVIII He played his jealous fancies over her, And if he heard that any other man Spoke to her, would beseech her straight to swear To each word—or the speaker had his ban; And out of her sweet wits she almost ran For fear; but all was fraud and flattery, Since without love he feignèd jealousy. XIX All which with so much sweetness suffered she, Whate'er he willed she thought the wisest thing; And evermore she loved him tenderly, And did him honour as he were a king. Her heart was wedded to him with a ring, So eager to be faithful and intent, That wheresoe'er he wandered, there it went. XX When she would eat he stole away her thought, Till little thought for food, I ween, was kept; And when a time for rest the midnight brought, She always mused upon him till she slept,— When he was absent, secretly she wept; And thus lived Queen Annelida the fair, For false Arcite, who worked her this despair. XXI This false Arcite in his new-fangleness, Because so gentle were her ways and true, Took the less pleasure in her stedfastness, And saw another lady proud and new, And right anon he clad him in her hue; I know not whether white, or red, or green, Betraying fair Annelida the Queen. XXII And yet it was no thing to wonder on, Though he were false—It is the way of man, (Since Lamech was, who flourished years agone,) To be in love as false as any can; For he was the first father who began To love two; and I trow, indeed, that he Invented tents as well as bigamy. XXIII And having so betrayed her, false Arcite Feign'd more, that primal wrong to justify. A vicious horse will snort besides his bite; And so he taunted her with treachery, Swearing he saw thro' her duplicity, And how she was not loving, but false-hearted— The perjured traitor swore thus, and departed. XXIV Alas, alas, what heart could suffer it, For ruth, the story of her grief to tell? What thinker hath the cunning and the wit To image it? what hearer, strength to dwell A room's length off, while I rehearse the hell Suffered by Queen Annelida the fair For false Arcite, who worked her this despair? XXV She weepeth, waileth, swooneth piteously; She falleth on the earth dead as a stone; Her graceful limbs are cramped convulsively; She speaketh out wild, as her wits were gone. No colour, but an ashen paleness—none— Touched cheek or lips; and no word shook their white, But ‘Mercy, cruel heart! mine own Arcite!’ XXVI Thus it continued, till she pinèd so, And grew so weak, her feet no more could bear Her body, languishing in ceaseless woe. Whereof Arcite had neither ruth nor care— His heart had put out new-green shoots elsewhere; Therefore he deigned not on her grief to think, And reckoned little, did she float or sink. XXVII His fine new lady kept him in such narrow Strict limit, by the bridle, at the end O' the whip, he feared her least word as an arrow,— Her threatening made him, as a bow, to bend, And at her pleasure did he turn and wend; Seeing she never granted to this lover A single grace he could sing ‘Ios’ over. XXVIII She drove him forth—she scarcely deigned to know That he was servant to her ladyship: But, lest he should be proud, she kept him low, Nor paid his service from a smiling lip: She sent him now to land, and now to ship; And giving him all danger to his fill, She thereby had him at her sovereign will. XXIX Be taught of this, ye prudent women all, Warn'd by Annelida and false Arcite: Because she chose, himself, ‘dear heart’ to call And be so meek, he loved her not aright. The nature of man's heart is to delight In something strange—moreover, (may Heaven save The wrong'd) the thing they cannot, they would have. XXX Now turn we to Annelida again, Who pinèd day by day in languishment. But when she saw no comfort met her pain, Weeping once in a woeful unconstraint, She set herself to fashion a complaint, Which with her own pale hand she 'gan to write, And sent it to her lover, to Arcite. THE COMPLAINT OF ANNELIDA TO FALSE ARCITE. I. The sword of sorrow, whetted sharp for me On false delight, with point of memory Stabb'd so mine heart, bliss-bare and black of hue, That all to dread is turn'd my dance's glee, My face's beauty to despondency— For nothing it availeth to be true— And, whosoever is so, she shall rue Obeying love, and cleaving faithfully Alway to one, and changing for no new. II. I ought to know it well as any wight, For I loved one with all my heart and might, More than myself a hundred-thousand fold, And callèd him my heart's dear life, my knight, And was all his, as far as it was right; His gladness did my blitheness make of old, And in his least disease my death was told; Who, on his side, had plighted lovers' plight, Me, evermore, his lady and love to hold. III. Now is he false—alas, alas!—although Unwronged! and acting such a ruthless part, That with a little word he will not deign To bring the peace back to my mournful heart. Drawn in, and caught up by another's art, Right as he will, he laugheth at my pain; While I—I cannot my weak heart restrain From loving him—still, aye; yet none I know To whom of all this grief I can complain. IV. Shall I complain (ah, piteous and harsh sound!) Unto my foe, who gave mine heart a wound, And still desireth that the harm be more? Now certes, if I sought the whole earth round, No other help, no better leach were found! My destiny hath shaped it so of yore— I would not other medicine, nor yet lore. I would be ever where I once was bound; And what I said, would say for evermore. V. Alas! and where is gone your gentillesse? Where gone your pleasant words, your humbleness? Where your devotion full of reverent fear, Your patient loyalty, your busy address To me, whom once you callèd nothing less Than mistress, sovereign lady, i' the sphere O' the world? Ah me! no word, no look of cheer, Will you vouchsafe upon my heaviness! Alas your love! I bought it all too dear. VI. Now certes, sweet, howe'er you be The cause so, and so causelessly, Of this my mortal agony, Your reason should amend the failing! Your friend, your true love, do you flee, Who never in time nor yet degree Grieved you: so may the all-knowing he Save my lorn soul from future wailing. VII. Because I was so plain, Arcite, In all my doings, your delight Seeking in all things, where I might In honour,—meek and kind and free; Therefore you do me such despite. Alas! howe'er through cruelty My heart with sorrow's sword you smite, You cannot kill its love.—Ah me! VIII. Ah, my sweet foe, why do you so For shame? Think you that praise, in sooth, will raise Your name, Loving anew, and being untrue For aye? Thus casting down your manhood's crown In blame, And working me adversity, The same Who loves you most—(O God, thou know'st!) Alway? Yet turn again—be fair and plain Some day; And then shall this, that seems amiss, Be game, All being forgiv'n, while yet from heav'n I stay. IX. Behold, dear heart, I write this to obtain Some knowledge, whether I should pray or 'plaine: Which way is best to force you to be true? For either I must have you in my chain, Or you, sweet, with the death must part us twain; There is no mean, no other way more new: And, that Heaven's mercy on my soul may rue And let you slay me outright with this pain, The whiteness in my cheeks may prove to you. X. For hitherto mine own death have I sought; Myself I murder with my secret thought, In sorrow and ruth of your unkindnesses! I weep, I wail, I fast—all helpeth nought, I flee all joy (I mean the name of aught), I flee all company, all mirthfulness— Why, who can make her boast of more distress Than I? To such a plight you have me brought, Guiltless (I need no witness) ne'ertheless. XI. Shall I go pray and wail my womanhood? Compared to such a deed, death's self were good. What! ask for mercy, and guiltless—where's the need? And if I wailed my life so,—that you would Care nothing, is less feared than understood: And if mine oath of love I dared to plead In mine excuse,—your scorn would be its meed. Ah, love! it giveth flowers instead of seed— Full long ago I might have taken heed. XII. And though I had you back to-morrow again, I might as well hold April from the rain As hold you to the vows you vowed me last. Maker of all things, and truth's sovereign, Where is the truth of man, who hath it slain, That she who loveth him should find him fast As in a tempest is a rotten mast? Is that a tame beast which is ever fain To flee us when restraint and fear are past? XIII. Now mercy, sweet, if I mis-say;— Have I said aught is wrong to-day? I do not know—my wit's astray— I fare as doth the song of one who weepeth; For now I 'plaine, and now I play— I am so 'mazed, I die away— Arcite, you have the key for aye Of all my world, and all the good it keepeth. XIV. And in this world there is not one Who walketh with a sadder moan, And bears more grief than I have done; And if light slumbers overcome me, Methinks your image, in the glory Of skiey azure, stands before me, Re-vowing the old love you bore me, And praying for new mercy from me. XV. Through the long night, this wondrous sight, Bear I, Which haunteth still, the daylight, till I die: But nought of this, your heart, I wis, Can reach. Mine eyes down-pour, they nevermore Are dry, While to your ruth, and eke your truth, I cry— But, weladay, too far be they To fetch. Thus destiny is holding me— Ah, wretch! And when I fain would break the chain, And try— Faileth my wit (so weak is it) With speech. XVI. Therefore I end thus, since my hope is o'er— I give all up both now and evermore; And in the balance ne'er again will lay My safety, nor be studious in love-lore. But like the swan who, as I heard of yore, Singeth life's penance on his deathly day, So I sing here my life and woes away,— Ay, how you, cruel Arcite, wounded sore, With memory's point, your poor Annelida. XVII. After Annelida, the woeful queen, Had written in her own hand in this wise, With ghastly face, less pale than white, I ween, She fell a-swooning; then she 'gan arise, And unto Mars voweth a sacrifice Within the temple, with a sorrowful bearing, And in such phrase as meets your present hearing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. The author's Preface to these poems will be found at the beginning of the present volume. 1844. De patrie, et de Dieu, des poêtes, de l'âme Qui s'élève en priant. —Victor Hugo. A DRAMA OF EXILE. PERSONS. Christ, in a Vision. Adam. Eve. Gabriel. Lucifer. Angels, Eden Spirits, Earth Spirits, and Phantasms. Scene.—The outer side of the gate of Eden shut fast with cloud, from the depth of which revolves a sword of fire self-moved. Adam and Eve are seen in the distance flying along the glare. Lucifer, alone. Rejoice in the clefts of Gehenna, My exiled, my host! Earth has exiles as hopeless as when a Heaven's empire was lost. Through the seams of her shaken foundations, Smoke up in great joy! With the smoke of your fierce exultations Deform and destroy! Smoke up with your lurid revenges, And darken the face Of the white heavens and taunt them with changes From glory and grace. We, in falling, while destiny strangles, Pull down with us all. Let them look to the rest of their angels! Who's safe from a fall? He saves not. Where's Adam? Can pardon Requicken that sod? Unkinged is the King of the Garden, The image of God. Other exiles are cast out of Eden,— More curse has been hurled: Come up, O my locusts, and feed in The green of the world! Come up! we have conquered by evil; Good reigns not alone: I prevail now, and, angel or devil, Inherit a throne. [In sudden apparition a watch of innumerable Angels, rank above rank, slopes up from around the gate to the zenith. The Angel Gabriel descends. Lucifer. Hail, Gabriel, the keeper of the gate! Now that the fruit is plucked, prince Gabriel, I hold that Eden is impregnable Under thy keeping. Gabriel. Angel of the sin, Such as thou standest,—pale in the drear light Which rounds the rebel's work with Maker's wrath,— Thou shalt be an Idea to all souls, A monumental melancholy gloom Seen down all ages, whence to mark despair And measure out the distances from good. Go from us straightway! Lucifer. Wherefore? Gabriel. Lucifer, Thy last step in this place trod sorrow up. Recoil before that sorrow, if not this sword. Lucifer. Angels are in the world—wherefore not I? Exiles are in the world—wherefore not I? The cursed are in the world—wherefore not I? Gabriel. Depart! Lucifer. And where's the logic of ‘depart’? Our lady Eve had half been satisfied To obey her Maker, if I had not learnt To fix my postulate better. Dost thou dream Of guarding some monopoly in heaven Instead of earth? Why, I can dream with thee To the length of thy wings. Gabriel. I do not dream. This is not heaven, even in a dream, nor earth, As earth was once, first breathed among the stars, Articulate glory from the mouth divine, To which the myriad spheres thrilled audibly, Touched like a lute-string, and the sons of God Said Amen, singing it. I know that this Is earth not new created but new cursed— This, Eden's gate not opened but built up With a final cloud of sunset. Do I dream? Alas, not so! this is the Eden lost By Lucifer the serpent; this the sword (This sword alive with justice and with fire) That smote, upon the forehead, Lucifer The angel. Wherefore, angel, go—depart! Enough is sinned and suffered. Lucifer. By no means. Here's a brave earth to sin and suffer on: It holds fast still—it cracks not under curse; It holds like mine immortal. Presently We'll sow it thick enough with graves as green Or greener certes, than its knowledge-tree. We'll have the cypress for the tree of life, More eminent for shadow: for the rest, We'll build it dark with towns and pyramids, And temples, if it please you:—we'll have feasts And funerals also, merrymakes and wars, Till blood and wine shall mix and run along Right o'er the edges. And, good Gabriel (Ye like that word in heaven), I too have strength— Strength to behold Him and not worship Him, Strength to fall from Him and not cry on Him, Strength to be in the universe and yet Neither God nor his servant. The red sign Burnt on my forehead, which you taunt me with, Is God's sign that it bows not unto God, The potter's mark upon his work, to show It rings well to the striker. I and the earth Can bear more curse. Gabriel. O miserable earth, O ruined angel! Lucifer. Well, and if it be! I chose this ruin; I elected it Of my will, not of service. What I do, I do volitient, not obedient, And overtop thy crown with my despair. My sorrow crowns me. Get thee back to heaven, And leave me to the earth, which is mine own In virtue of her ruin, as I hers In virtue of my revolt! Turn thou from both That bright, impassive, passive angelhood, And spare to read us backward any more Of the spent hallelujahs! Gabriel. Spirit of scorn, I might say, of unreason! I might say, That who despairs, acts; that who acts, connives With God's relations set in time and space; That who elects, assumes a something good Which God made possible; that who lives, obeys The law of a Life-maker . . . Lucifer. Let it pass! No more, thou Gabriel! What if I stand up And strike my brow against the crystalline Roofing the creatures,—shall I say, for that, My stature is too high for me to stand,— Henceforward I must sit? Sit thou! Gabriel. I kneel. Lucifer. A heavenly answer. Get thee to thy heaven, And leave my earth to me! Gabriel. Through heaven and earth God's will moves freely, and I follow it, As colour follows light. He overflows The firmamental walls with deity, Therefore with love; his lightnings go abroad, His pity may do so, his angels must, Whene'er he gives them charges. Lucifer. Verily, I and my demons, who are spirits of scorn, Might hold this charge of standing with a sword 'Twixt man and his inheritance, as well As the benignest angel of you all. Gabriel. Thou speakest in the shadow of thy change. If thou hadst gazed upon the face of God This morning for a moment, thou hadst known That only pity fitly can chastise: Hate but avenges. Lucifer. As it is, I know Something of pity. When I reeled in heaven, And my sword grew too heavy for my grasp, Stabbing through matter, which it could not pierce So much as the first shell of,—toward the throne; When I fell back, down,—staring up as I fell,— The lightnings holding open my scathed lids, And that thought of the infinite of God, Hurled after to precipitate descent; When countless angel faces still and stern Pressed out upon me from the level heavens Adown the abysmal spaces, and I fell Trampled down by your stillness, and struck blind By the sight within your eyes,—'twas then I knew How ye could pity, my kind angelhood! Gabriel. Alas, discrowned one, by the truth in me Which God keeps in me, I would give away All—save that truth and his love keeping it,— To lead thee home again into the light And hear thy voice chant with the morning stars, When their rays tremble round them with much song Sung in more gladness! Lucifer. Sing, my Morning Star! Last beautiful, last heavenly, that I loved! If I could drench thy golden locks with tears, What were it to this angel? Gabriel. What love is. And now I have named God. Lucifer. Yet, Gabriel, By the lie in me which I keep myself, Thou'rt a false swearer. Were it otherwise, What dost thou here, vouchsafing tender thoughts To that earth-angel or earth-demon—which, Thou and I have not solved the problem yet Enough to argue,—that fallen Adam there,— That red-clay and a breath,—who must, forsooth, Live in a new apocalypse of sense, With beauty and music waving in his trees And running in his rivers, to make glad His soul made perfect?—is it not for hope, A hope within thee deeper than thy truth, Of finally conducting him and his To fill the vacant thrones of me and mine, Which affront heaven with their vacuity? Gabriel. Angel, there are no vacant thrones in heaven To suit thy empty words. Glory and life Fulfil their own depletions; and if God Sighed you far from him, his next breath drew in A compensative splendour up the vast, Flushing the starry arteries. Lucifer. What a change! So, let the vacant thrones and gardens too Fill as may please you!—and be pitiful, As ye translate that word, to the dethroned And exiled, man or angel. The fact stands, That I, the rebel, the cast out and down, Am here and will not go; while there, along The light to which ye flash the desert out, Flies your adopted Adam, your red-clay In two kinds, both being flawed. Why, what is this? Whose work is this? Whose hand was in the work? Against whose hand? In this last strife, methinks, I am not a fallen angel! Gabriel. Dost thou know Aught of those exiles? Lucifer. Ay: I know they have fled Silent all day along the wilderness: I know they wear, for burden on their backs, The thought of a shut gate of Paradise, And faces of the marshalled cherubim Shining against, not for them; and I know They dare not look in one another's face,— As if each were a cherub! Gabriel. Dost thou know Aught of their future? Lucifer. Only as much as this: That evil will increase and multiply Without a benediction. Gabriel. Nothing more? Lucifer. Why so the angels taunt! What should be more? Gabriel. God is more. Lucifer. Proving what? Gabriel. That he is God, And capable of saving. Lucifer, I charge thee by the solitude he kept Ere he created,—leave the earth to God! Lucifer. My foot is on the earth, firm as my sin. Gabriel. I charge thee by the memory of heaven Ere any sin was done,—leave earth to God! Lucifer. My sin is on the earth, to reign thereon. Gabriel. I charge thee by the choral song we sang, When up against the white shore of our feet The depths of the creation swelled and brake,— And the new worlds, the beaded foam and flower Of all that coil, roared outward into space On thunder-edges,—leave the earth to God! Lucifer. My woe is on the earth, to curse thereby. Gabriel. I charge thee by that mournful Morning Star Which trembles . . . Lucifer. Enough spoken. As the pine In norland forest drops its weight of snows By a night's growth, so, growing toward my ends I drop thy counsels. Farewell, Gabriel! Watch out thy service; I achieve my will. And peradventure in the after years, When thoughtful men shall bend their spacious brows Upon the storm and strife seen everywhere To ruffle their smooth manhood and break up With lurid lights of intermittent hope Their human fear and wrong,—they may discern The heart of a lost angel in the earth. (Chanting from Paradise, while Adam and Eve fly across the Sword-glare). CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS Hearken, oh hearken! let your souls behind you Turn, gently moved! Our voices feel along the Dread to find you, O lost, beloved! Through the thick-shielded and strong-marshalled angels, They press and pierce: Our requiems follow fast on our evangels,— Voice throbs in verse. We are but orphaned spirits left in Eden A time ago: God gave us golden cups, and we were bidden To feed you so. But now our right hand hath no cup remaining, No work to do, The mystic hydromel is spilt, and staining The whole earth through. Most ineradicable stains, for showing (Not interfused!) That brighter colours were the world's forgoing, Than shall be used. Hearken, oh hearken! ye shall hearken surely For years and years, The noise beside you, dripping coldly, purely, Of spirits' tears. The yearning to a beautiful denied you Shall strain your powers; Ideal sweetnesses shall overglide you, Resumed from ours. In all your music, our pathetic minor Your ears shall cross; And all good gifts shall mind you of diviner, With sense of loss. We shall be near you in your poet-languors And wild extremes, What time ye vex the desert with vain angers, Or mock with dreams. And when upon you, weary after roaming, Death's seal is put, By the foregone ye shall discern the coming, Through eyelids shut. Spirits of the Trees. Hark! the Eden trees are stirring, Soft and solemn in your hearing! Oak and linden, palm and fir, Tamarisk and juniper, Each still throbbing in vibration Since that crowning of creation When the God-breath spake abroad, Let us make man like to God! And the pine stood quivering As the awful word went by, Like a vibrant music-string Stretched from mountain-peak to sky; And the platan did expand Slow and gradual, branch and head; And the cedar's strong black shade Fluttered brokenly and grand: Grove and wood were swept aslant In emotion jubilant. Voice of the same, but softer. Which divine impulsion cleaves In dim movements to the leaves Dropt and lifted, dropt and lifted, In the sunlight greenly sifted,— In the sunlight and the moonlight Greenly sifted through the trees. Ever wave the Eden trees In the nightlight and the noonlight, With a ruffling of green branches Shaded off to resonances, Never stirred by rain or breeze. Fare ye well, farewell! The sylvan sounds, no longer audible, Expire at Eden's door. Each footstep of your treading Treads out some murmur which ye heard before. Farewell! the trees of Eden, Ye shall hear nevermore. River Spirits. Hark! the flow of the four rivers— Hark the flow! How the silence round you shivers, While our voices through it go, Cold and clear. A softer Voice. Think a little, while ye hear, Of the banks Where the willows and the deer Crowd in intermingled ranks, As if all would drink at once Where the living water runs!— Of the fishes' golden edges Flashing in and out the sedges; Of the swans on silver thrones, Floating down the winding streams With impassive eyes turned shoreward And a chant of undertones,— And the lotos leaning forward To help them into dreams! Fare ye well, farewell! The river-sounds, no longer audible, Expire at Eden's door. Each footstep of your treading Treads out some murmur which ye heard before. Farewell! the streams of Eden, Ye shall hear nevermore. Bird Spirit. I am the nearest nightingale That singeth in Eden after you; And I am singing loud and true, And sweet,—I do not fail. I sit upon a cypress bough, Close to the gate, and I fling my song Over the gate and through the mail Of the warden angels marshalled strong,— Over the gate and after you. And the warden angels let it pass, Because the poor brown bird, alas, Sings in the garden, sweet and true. And I build my song of high pure notes, Note over note, height over height, Till I strike the arch of the Infinite, And I bridge abysmal agonies With strong, clear calms of harmonies,— And something abides, and something floats, In the song which I sing after you. Fare ye well, farewell! The creature-sounds, no longer audible, Expire at Eden's door. Each footstep of your treading Treads out some cadence which ye heard before. Farewell! the birds of Eden, Ye shall hear nevermore. Flower Spirits. We linger, we linger, The last of the throng, Like the tones of a singer Who loves his own song. We are spirit-aromas Of blossom and bloom. We call your thoughts home,—as Ye breathe our perfume,— To the amaranth's splendour Afire on the slopes; To the lily-bells tender, And grey heliotropes; To the poppy-plains keeping Such dream-breath and blee That the angels there stepping Grew whiter to see: To the nook, set with moly, Ye jested one day in, Till your smile waxed too holy And left your lips praying: To the rose in the bower-place, That dripped o'er you sleeping; To the asphodel flower-place, Ye walked ankle-deep in. We pluck at your raiment, We stroke down your hair, We faint in our lament And pine into air. Fare ye well, farewell! The Eden scents, no longer sensible, Expire at Eden's door. Each footstep of your treading Treads out some fragrance which ye knew before. Farewell! the flowers of Eden, Ye shall smell nevermore. [There is silence. Adam and Eve fly on, and never look back. Only a colossal shadow, as of the dark Angel passing quickly, is cast upon the Sword-glare. Scene.—The extremity of the Sword-glare. Adam. Pausing a moment on this outer edge Where the supernal sword-glare cuts in light The dark exterior desert,—hast thou strength, Beloved, to look behind us to the gate? Eve. Have I not strength to look up to thy face? Adam. We need be strong: yon spectacle of cloud Which seals the gate up to the final doom, Is God's seal manifest. There seem to lie A hundred thunders in it, dark and dead; The unmolten lightnings vein it motionless; And, outward from its depth, the self-moved sword Swings slow its awful gnomon of red fire From side to side, in pendulous horror slow, Across the stagnant ghastly glare thrown flat On the intermediate ground from that to this. The angelic hosts, the archangelic pomps, Thrones, dominations, princedoms, rank on rank, Rising sublimely to the feet of God, On either side and overhead the gate, Show like a glittering and sustainèd smoke Drawn to an apex. That their faces shine Betwixt the solemn clasping of their wings Clasped high to a silver point above their heads,— We only guess from hence, and not discern. Eve. Though we were near enough to see them shine, The shadow on thy face were awfuller, To me, at least,—to me—than all their light. Adam. What is this, Eve? thou droppest heavily In a heap earthward, and thy body heaves Under the golden floodings of thine hair! Eve. O Adam, Adam! by that name of Eve— Thine Eve, thy life—which suits me little now, Seeing that I now confess myself thy death And thine undoer, as the snake was mine,— I do adjure thee, put me straight away, Together with my name! Sweet, punish me! O Love, be just! and, ere we pass beyond The light cast outward by the fiery sword, Into the dark which earth must be to us, Bruise my head with thy foot,—as the curse said My seed shall the first tempter's! strike with curse, As God struck in the garden! and as he, Being satisfied with justice and with wrath, Did roll his thunder gentler at the close,— Thou, peradventure, mayst at last recoil To some soft need of mercy. Strike, my lord! I, also, after tempting, writhe on the ground, And I would feed on ashes from thine hand, As suits me, O my tempted! Adam. My beloved, Mine Eve and life—I have no other name For thee or for the sun than what ye are, My utter life and light! If we have fallen, It is that we have sinned,—we: God is just; And, since his curse doth comprehend us both, It must be that his balance holds the weights Of first and last sin on a level. What! Shall I who had not virtue to stand straight Among the hills of Eden, here assume To mend the justice of the perfect God, By piling up a curse upon his curse, Against thee—thee? Eve. For so, perchance, thy God Might take thee into grace for scorning me; Thy wrath against the sinner giving proof Of inward abrogation of the sin: And so, the blessèd angels might come down And walk with thee as erst,—I think they would,— Because I was not near to make them sad Or soil the rustling of their innocence. Adam. They know me. I am deepest in the guilt, If last in the transgression. Eve. Thou! Adam. If God, Who gave the right and joyaunce of the world Both unto thee and me,—gave thee to me, The best gift last, the last sin was the worst, Which sinned against more complement of gifts And grace of giving. God! I render back Strong benediction and perpetual praise From mortal feeble lips (as incense-smoke, Out of a little censer, may fill heaven), That thou, in striking my benumbèd hands And forcing them to drop all other boons Of beauty and dominion and delight,— Hast left this well-belovèd Eve, this life Within life, this best gift between their palms, In gracious compensation! Eve. Is it thy voice? Or some saluting angel's—calling home My feet into the garden? Adam. O my God! I, standing here between the glory and dark,— The glory of thy wrath projected forth From Eden's wall, the dark of our distress Which settles a step off in that drear world— Lift up to thee the hands from whence hath fallen Only creation's sceptre,—thanking thee That rather thou hast cast me out with her Than left me lorn of her in Paradise, With angel looks and angel songs around To show the absence of her eyes and voice, And make society full desertness Without her use in comfort! Eve. Where is loss? Am I in Eden? can another speak Mine own love's tongue? Adam. Because with her, I stand Upright, as far as can be in this fall, And look away from heaven which doth accuse, And look away from earth which doth convict, Into her face, and crown my discrowned brow Out of her love, and put the thought of her Around me, for an Eden full of birds, And lift her body up—thus—to my heart, And with my lips upon her lips,—thus, thus,— Do quicken and sublimate my mortal breath Which cannot climb against the grave's steep sides But overtops this grief. Eve. I am renewed. My eyes grow with the light which is in thine; The silence of my heart is full of sound. Hold me up—so! Because I comprehend This human love, I shall not be afraid Of any human death; and yet because I know this strength of love, I seem to know Death's strength by that same sign. Kiss on my lips, To shut the door close on my rising soul,— Lest it pass outwards in astonishment And leave thee lonely! Adam. Yet thou liest, Eve, Bent heavily on thyself across mine arm, Thy face flat to the sky. Eve. Ay, and the tears Running, as it might seem, my life from me, They run so fast and warm. Let me lie so, And weep so, as if in a dream or prayer, Unfastening, clasp by clasp, the hard tight thought Which clipped my heart and showed me evermore Loathed of thy justice as I loathe the snake, And as the pure ones loathe our sin. Today, All day, belovèd, as we fled across This desolating radiance cast by swords Not suns,—my lips prayed soundless to myself, Striking against each other—“O Lord God!” ('Twas so I prayed) “I ask Thee by my sin, “And by thy curse, and by thy blameless heavens, “Make dreadful haste to hide me from thy face “And from the face of my belovèd here “For whom I am no helpmeet, quick away “Into the new dark mystery of death! “I will lie still there, I will make no plaint, “I will not sigh, nor sob, nor speak a word, “Nor struggle to come back beneath the sun “Where peradventure I might sin anew “Against thy mercy and his pleasure. Death, “O death, whate'er it be, is good enough “For such as I am: while for Adam here, “No voice shall say again, in heaven or earth, “It is not good for him to be alone.” Adam. And was it good for such a prayer to pass, My unkind Eve, betwixt our mutual lives? If I am exiled, must I be bereaved? Eve. 'Twas an ill prayer: it shall be prayed no more; And God did use it like a foolishness, Giving no answer. Now my heart has grown Too high and strong for such a foolish prayer; Love makes it strong: and since I was the first In the transgression, with a steady foot I will be first to tread from this sword-glare Into the outer darkness of the waste,— And thus I do it. Adam. Thus I follow thee, As erewhile in the sin.—What sounds! what sounds! I feel a music which comes straight from heaven, As tender as a watering dew. Eve. I think That angels—not those guarding Paradise,— But the love-angels, who came erst to us, And when we said ‘God,’ fainted unawares Back from our mortal presence unto God, (As if he drew them inward in a breath) His name being heard of them,—I think that they With sliding voices lean from heavenly towers, Invisible but gracious. Hark—how soft! Faint and tender. CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS. Mortal man and woman, Go upon your travel! Heaven assist the human Smoothly to unravel All that web of pain Wherein ye are holden. Do ye know our voices Chanting down the Golden? Do ye guess our choice is, Being unbeholden, To be hearkened by you yet again? This pure door of opal God hath shut between us,— Us, his shining people, You, who once have seen us And are blinded new! Yet, across the doorway, Past the silence reaching, Farewells evermore may, Blessing in the teaching, Glide from us to you. First Semichorus. Think how erst your Eden, Day on day succeeding, With our presence glowed. We came as if the Heavens were bowed To a milder music rare. Ye saw us in our solemn treading, Treading down the steps of cloud, While our wings, outspreading Double calms of whiteness, Dropped superfluous brightness Down from stair to stair. Second Semichorus. Or oft, abrupt though tender, While ye gazed on space, We flashed our angel-splendour In either human face. With mystic lilies in our hands, From the atmospheric bands Breaking with a sudden grace, We took you unaware! While our feet struck glories Outward, smooth and fair, Which we stood on floorwise, Platformed in mid-air. First Semichorus. Or oft, when Heaven-descended, Stood we in our wondering sight In a mute apocalypse With dumb vibrations on our lips From hosannas ended, And grand half-vanishings Of the empyreal things Within our eyes belated, Till the heavenly Infinite Falling off from the Created, Left our inward contemplation Opened into ministration. Chorus. Then upon our axle turning Of great joy to sympathy, We sang out the morning Broadening up the sky. Or we drew Our music through The noontide's hush and heat and shine, Informed with our intense Divine: Interrupted vital notes Palpitating hither, thither, Burning out into the æther, Sensible like fiery motes. Or, whenever twilight drifted Through the cedar masses, The globèd sun we lifted, Trailing purple, trailing gold Out between the passes Of the mountains manifold, To anthems slowly sung: While he,—aweary, half in swoon For joy to hear our climbing tune Transpierce the stars' concentric rings,— The burden of his glory flung In broken lights upon our wings. [The chant dies away confusedly, and Lucifer appears. Lucifer. Now may all fruits be pleasant to thy lips, Beautiful Eve! The times have somewhat changed Since thou and I had talk beneath a tree, Albeit ye are not gods yet. Eve. Adam! hold My right hand strongly! It is Lucifer— And we have love to lose. Adam. I' the name of God, Go apart from us, O thou Lucifer! And leave us to the desert thou hast made Out of thy treason. Bring no serpent-slime Athwart this path kept holy to our tears! Or we may curse thee with their bitterness. Lucifer. Curse freely! curses thicken. Why, this Eve Who thought me once part worthy of her ear And somewhat wiser than the other beasts,— Drawing together her large globes of eyes, The light of which is throbbing in and out Their steadfast continuity of gaze,— Knots her fair eyebrows in so hard a knot, And down from her white heights of womanhood Looks on me so amazed,—I scarce should fear To wager such an apple as she plucked Against one riper from the tree of life, That she could curse too—as a woman may— Smooth in the vowels. Eve. So—speak wickedly! I like it best so. Let thy words be wounds,— For, so, I shall not fear thy power to hurt. Trench on the forms of good by open ill— For, so, I shall wax strong and grand with scorn, Scorning myself for ever trusting thee As far as thinking, ere a snake ate dust, He could speak wisdom. Lucifer. Our new gods, it seems, Deal more in thunders than in courtesies. And, sooth, mine own Olympus, which anon I shall build up to loud-voiced imagery From all the wandering visions of the world, May show worse railing than our lady Eve Pours o'er the rounding of her argent arm. But why should this be? Adam pardoned Eve. Adam. Adam loved Eve. Jehovah pardon both! Eve. Adam forgave Eve—because loving Eve. Lucifer. So, well. Yet Adam was undone of Eve, As both were by the snake. Therefore forgive, In like wise, fellow-temptress, the poor snake— Who stung there, not so poorly! [Aside. Eve. Hold thy wrath, Belovèd Adam! let me answer him; For this time he speaks truth, which we should hear, And asks for mercy, which I most should grant, In like wise, as he tells us—in like wise! And therefore I thee pardon, Lucifer, As freely as the streams of Eden flowed When we were happy by them. So, depart; Leave us to walk the remnant of our time Out mildly in the desert. Do not seek To harm us any more or scoff at us, Or ere the dust be laid upon our face, To find there the communion of the dust And issue of the dust.—Go! Adam. At once, go! Lucifer. Forgive! and go! Ye images of clay, Shrunk somewhat in the mould,—what jest is this? What words are these to use? By what a thought Conceive ye of me? Yesterday—a snake! To-day—what? Adam. A strong spirit. Eve. A sad spirit. Adam. Perhaps a fallen angel.—Who shall say! Lucifer. Who told thee, Adam? Adam. Thou! The prodigy Of thy vast brows and melancholy eyes Which comprehend the heights of some great fall. I think that thou hast one day worn a crown Under the eyes of God. Lucifer. And why of God? Adam. It were no crown else. Verily, I think Thou'rt fallen far. I had not yesterday Said it so surely, but I know to-day Grief by grief, sin by sin. Lucifer. A crown, by a crown. Adam. Ay, mock me! now I know more than I knew: Now I know that thou art fallen below hope Of final re-ascent. Lucifer. Because? Adam. Because A spirit who expected to see God Though at the last point of a million years, Could dare no mockery of a ruined man Such as this Adam. Lucifer. Who is high and bold— Be it said passing!—of a good red clay Discovered on some top of Lebanon, Or haply of Aornus, beyond sweep Of the black eagle's wing! A furlong lower Had made a meeker king for Eden. Soh! Is it not possible, by sin and grief (To give the things your names) that spirits should rise Instead of falling? Adam. Most impossible. The Highest being the Holy and the Glad, Whoever rises must approach delight And sanctity in the act. Lucifer. Ha, my clay-king! Thou wilt not rule by wisdom very long The after generations. Earth, methinks, Will disinherit thy philosophy For a new doctrine suited to thine heirs, And class these present dogmas with the rest Of the old-world traditions, Eden fruits And Saurian fossils. Eve. Speak no more with him, Beloved! it is not good to speak with him. Go from us, Lucifer, and speak no more! We have no pardon which thou dost not scorn, Nor any bliss, thou seest, for coveting, Nor innocence for staining. Being bereft, We would be alone.—Go! Lucifer. Ah! ye talk the same, All of you—spirits and clay—go, and depart! In Heaven they said so, and at Eden's gate, And here, reiterant, in the wilderness. None saith, Stay with me, for thy face is fair! None saith, Stay with me, for thy voice is sweet! And yet I was not fashioned out of clay. Look on me, woman! Am I beautiful? Eve. Thou hast a glorious darkness. Lucifer. Nothing more? Eve. I think, no more. Lucifer. False Heart—thou thinkest more! Thou canst not choose but think, as I praise God, Unwillingly but fully, that I stand Most absolute in beauty. As yourselves Were fashioned very good at best, so we Sprang very beauteous from the creant Word Which thrilled behind us, God himself being moved When that august work of a perfect shape, His dignities of sovran angel-hood, Swept out into the universe,—divine With thunderous movements, earnest looks of gods, And silver-solemn clash of cymbal wings. Whereof was I, in motion and in form, A part not poorest. And yet,—yet, perhaps, This beauty which I speak of, is not here, As God's voice is not here, nor even my crown— I do not know. What is this thought or thing Which I call beauty? Is it thought, or thing? Is it a thought accepted for a thing? Or both? or neither?—a pretext—a word? Its meaning flutters in me like a flame Under my own breath: my perceptions reel For evermore around it, and fall off, As if it too were holy. Eve. Which it is. Adam. The essence of all beauty, I call love. The attribute, the evidence, and end, The consummation to the inward sense, Of beauty apprehended from without, I still call love. As form, when colourless, Is nothing to the eye,—that pine-tree there, Without its black and green, being all a blank,— So, without love, is beauty undiscerned In man or angel. Angel! rather ask What love is in thee, what love moves to thee, And what collateral love moves on with thee; Then shalt thou know if thou art beautiful. Lucifer. Love! what is love? I lose it. Beauty and love I darken to the image. Beauty—love! [He fades away, while a low music sounds. Adam. Thou art pale, Eve. Eve. The precipice of ill Down this colossal nature, dizzies me: And, hark! the starry harmony remote Seems measuring the heights from whence he fell. Adam. Think that we have not fallen so! By the hope And aspiration, by the love and faith, We do exceed the stature of this angel. Eve. Happier we are than he is, by the death. Adam. Or rather, by the life of the Lord God! How dim the angel grows, as if that blast Of music swept him back into the dark. [The music is stronger, gathering itself into uncertain articulation. Eve. It throbs in on us like a plaintive heart, Pressing, with slow pulsations, vibrative, Its gradual sweetness through the yielding air, To such expression as the stars may use, Most starry-sweet and strange! With every note That grows more loud, the angel grows more dim, Receding in proportion to approach, Until he stand afar,—a shade. Adam. Now, words. SONG OF THE MORNING STAR TO LUCIFER. He fades utterly away and vanishes, as it proceeds. Mine orbèd image sinks Back from thee, back from thee, As thou art fallen, methinks, Back from me, back from me. O my light-bearer, Could another fairer Lack to thee, lack to thee? Ah, ah, Heosphoros! I loved thee with the fiery love of stars Who love by burning, and by loving move, Too near the throned Jehovah not to love. Ah, ah, Heosphoros! Their brows flash fast on me from gliding cars, Pale-passioned for my loss. Ah, ah, Heosphoros! Mine orbèd heats drop cold Down from thee, down from thee, As fell thy grace of old Down from me, down from me. O my light-bearer, Is another fairer Won to thee, won to thee? Ah, ah, Heosphoros, Great love preceded loss, Known to thee, known to thee. Ah, ah! Thou, breathing thy communicable grace Of life into my light, Mine astral faces, from thine angel face, Hast inly fed, And flooded me with radiance overmuch From thy pure height. Ah, ah! Thou, with calm, floating pinions both ways spread, Erect, irradiated, Didst sting my wheel of glory On, on before thee Along the Godlight by a quickening touch! Ha, ha! Around, around the firmamental ocean I swam expanding with delirious fire! Around, around, around, in blind desire To be drawn upward to the Infinite— Ha, ha! Until, the motion flinging out the motion To a keen whirl of passion and avidity, To a dim whirl of languor and delight, I wound in gyrant orbits smooth and white With that intense rapidity. Around, around, I wound and interwound, While all the cyclic heavens about me spun. Stars, planets, suns, and moons dilated broad, Then flashed together into a single sun, And wound, and wound in one: And as they wound I wound,—around, around, In a great fire I almost took for God. Ha, ha, Heosphoros! Thine angel glory sinks Down from me, down from me— My beauty falls, methinks, Down from thee, down from thee! O my light-bearer, O my path-preparer, Gone from me, gone from me! Ah, ah, Heosphoros! I cannot kindle underneath the brow Of this new angel here, who is not thou. All things are altered since that time ago,— And if I shine at eve, I shall not know. I am strange—I am slow. Ah, ah, Heosphoros! Henceforward, human eyes of lovers be The only sweetest sight that I shall see, With tears between the looks raised up to me. Ah, ah! When, having wept all night, at break of day Above the folded hills they shall survey My light, a little trembling, in the grey. Ah, ah! And gazing on me, such shall comprehend, Through all my piteous pomp at morn or even, And melancholy leaning out of heaven, That love, their own divine, may change or end, That love may close in loss! Ah, ah, Heosphoros! Scene.—Farther on. A wild open country seen vaguely in the approaching night. Adam. How doth the wide and melancholy earth Gather her hills around us, grey and ghast, And stare with blank significance of loss Right in our faces! Is the wind up? Eve. Nay. Adam. And yet the cedars and the junipers Rock slowly through the mist, without a sound, And shapes which have no certainty of shape Drift duskly in and out between the pines, And loom along the edges of the hills, And lie flat, curdling in the open ground— Shadows without a body, which contract And lengthen as we gaze on them. Eve. O life Which is not man's nor angel's! What is this? Adam. No cause for fear. The circle of God's life Contains all life beside. Eve. I think the earth Is crazed with curse, and wanders from the sense Of those first laws affixed to form and space Or ever she knew sin. Adam. We will not fear: We were brave sinning. Eve. Yea, I plucked the fruit With eyes upturned to heaven and seeing there Our god-thrones, as the tempter said,—not God. My heart, which beat then, sinks. The sun hath sunk Out of sight with our Eden. Adam. Night is near. Eve. And God's curse, nearest. Let us travel back And stand within the sword-glare till we die, Believing it is better to meet death Than suffer desolation. Adam. Nay, beloved! We must not pluck death from the Maker's hand, As erst we plucked the apple: we must wait Until he gives death as he gave us life, Nor murmur faintly o'er the primal gift Because we spoilt its sweetness with our sin. Eve. Ah, ah! dost thou discern what I behold? Adam. I see all. How the spirits in thine eyes From their dilated orbits bound before To meet the spectral Dread! Eve. I am afraid— Ah, ah! the twilight bristles wild with shapes Of intermittent motion, aspect vague And mystic bearings, which o'ercreep the earth, Keeping slow time with horrors in the blood. How near they reach . . . and far! How grey they move— Treading upon the darkness without feet, And fluttering on the darkness without wings! Some run like dogs, with noses to the ground; Some keep one path, like sheep; some rock like trees; Some glide like a fallen leaf; and some flow on Copious as rivers. Adam. Some spring up like fire; And some coil . . . Eve. Ah, ah! dost thou pause to say Like what?—coil like the serpent, when he fell From all the emerald splendour of his height And writhed, and could not climb against the curse, Not a ring's length. I am afraid—afraid— I think it is God's will to make me afraid,— Permitting these to haunt us in the place Of his belovèd angels—gone from us Because we are not pure. Dear Pity of God, That didst permit the angels to go home And live no more with us who are not pure, Save us too from a loathly company— Almost as loathly in our eyes, perhaps, As we are in the purest! Pity us— Us too! nor shut us in the dark, away From verity and from stability, Or what we name such through the precedence Of earth's adjusted uses,—leave us not To doubt betwixt our senses and our souls, Which are the more distraught and full of pain And weak of apprehension! Adam. Courage, Sweet! The mystic shapes ebb back from us, and drop With slow concentric movement, each on each,— Expressing wider spaces,—and collapsed In lines more definite for imagery And clearer for relation, till the throng Of shapeless spectra merge into a few Distinguishable phantasms vague and grand Which sweep out and around us vastily And hold us in a circle and a calm. Eve. Strange phantasms of pale shadow! there are twelve. Thou who didst name all lives, hast names for these? Adam. Methinks this is the zodiac of the earth, Which rounds us with a visionary dread, Responding with twelve shadowy signs of earth, In fantasque apposition and approach, To those celestial, constellated twelve Which palpitate adown the silent nights Under the pressure of the hand of God Stretched wide in benediction. At this hour, Not a star pricketh the flat gloom of heaven: But, girdling close our nether wilderness, The zodiac-figures of the earth loom slow,— Drawn out, as suiteth with the place and time, In twelve colossal shades instead of stars, Through which the ecliptic line of mystery Strikes bleakly with an unrelenting scope, Foreshowing life and death. Eve. By dream or sense, Do we see this? Adam. Our spirits have climbed high By reason of the passion of our grief, And, from the top of sense, looked over sense To the significance and heart of things Rather than things themselves. Eve. And the dim twelve . . . Adam. Are dim exponents of the creature-life As earth contains it. Gaze on them, beloved! By stricter apprehension of the sight, Suggestions of the creatures shall assuage The terror of the shadows,—what is known Subduing the unknown and taming it From all prodigious dread. That phantasm, there, Presents a lion, albeit twenty times As large as any lion—with a roar Set soundless in his vibratory jaws, And a strange horror stirring in his mane. And, there, a pendulous shadow seems to weigh— Good against ill, perchance; and there, a crab Puts coldly out its gradual shadow-claws, Like a slow blot that spreads,—till all the ground, Crawled over by it, seems to crawl itself. A bull stands hornèd here with gibbous glooms; And a ram likewise: and a scorpion writhes Its tail in ghastly slime and stings the dark. This way a goat leaps with wild blank of beard; And here, fantastic fishes duskly float, Using the calm for waters, while their fins Throb out quick rhythms along the shallow air. While images more human— Eve. How he stands, That phantasm of a man—who is not thou! Two phantasms of two men! Adam. One that sustains, And one that strives,—resuming, so, the ends Of manhood's curse of labour. Adam recognises in Aquarius, the Water-bearer, and Sagittarius, the Archer, distinct types of the man bearing and the man combating, —the passive and active forms of human labour. I hope that the preceding zodiacal signs—transferred to the earthly shadow and representative purpose—of Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Leo, Libra, Scorpio, Capricornus, and Pisces, are sufficiently obvious to the reader. Dost thou see That phantasm of a woman? Eve. I have seen; But look off to those small humanities Her maternal instinct is excited by Gemini. Which draw me tenderly across my fear,— Lesser and fainter than my womanhood, Or yet thy manhood—with strange innocence Set in the misty lines of head and hand. They lean together! I would gaze on them Longer and longer, till my watching eyes, As the stars do in watching anything, Should light them forward from their outline vague To clear configuration. [Two Spirits, of Organic and Inorganic Nature, arise from the ground. But what Shapes Rise up between us in the open space, And thrust me into horror, back from hope! Adam. Colossal Shapes—twin sovran images, With a disconsolate, blank majesty Set in their wondrous faces! with no look, And yet an aspect—a significance Of individual life and passionate ends, Which overcomes us gazing. O bleak sound, O shadow of sound, O phantasm of thin sound! How it comes, wheeling as the pale moth wheels, Wheeling and wheeling in continuous wail Around the cyclic zodiac, and gains force, And gathers, settling coldly like a moth, On the wan faces of these images We see before us,—whereby modified, It draws a straight line of articulate song From out that spiral faintness of lament, And, by one voice, expresses many griefs. First Spirit. I am the spirit of the harmless earth. God spake me softly out among the stars, As softly as a blessing of much worth; And then his smile did follow unawares, That all things fashioned so for use and duty Might shine anointed with his chrism of beauty— Yet I wail! I drave on with the worlds exultingly, Obliquely down the Godlight's gradual fall; Individual aspect and complexity Of gyratory orb and interval Lost in the fluent motion of delight Toward the high ends of Being beyond sight— Yet I wail! Second Spirit. I am the spirit of the harmless beasts, Of flying things, and creeping things, and swimming; Of all the lives, erst set at silent feasts, That found the love-kiss on the goblet brimming, And tasted in each drop within the measure The sweetest pleasure of their Lord's good pleasure— Yet I wail! What a full hum of life around his lips Bore witness to the fulness of creation! How all the grand words were full-laden ships Each sailing onward from enunciation To separate existence,—and each bearing The creature's power of joying, hoping, fearing! Yet I wail! Eve. They wail, beloved! they speak of glory and God, And they wail—wail. That burden of the song Drops from it like its fruit, and heavily falls Into the lap of silence. Adam. Hark, again! First Spirit. I was so beautiful, so beautiful, My joy stood up within me bold to add A word to God's,—and, when His work was full, To “very good” responded “very glad!” Filtered through roses did the light enclose me, And bunches of the grape swam blue across me— Yet I wail! Second Spirit. I bounded with my panthers: I rejoiced In my young tumbling lions rolled together: My stag, the river at his fetlocks, poised Then dipped his antlers through the golden weather In the same ripple which the alligator Left, in his joyous troubling of the water— Yet I wail! First Spirit. O my deep waters, cataract and flood, What wordless triumph did your voices render! O mountain-summits, where the angels stood And shook from head and wing thick dews of splendour! How, with a holy quiet, did your Earthy Accept that Heavenly, knowing ye were worthy! Yet I wail! Second Spirit. O my wild wood-dogs, with your listening eyes! My horses—my ground-eagles, for swift fleeing! My birds, with viewless wings of harmonies, My calm cold fishes of a silver being, How happy were ye, living and possessing, O fair half-souls capacious of full blessing! Yet I wail! First Spirit. I wail, I wail! Now hear my charge to-day, Thou man, thou woman, marked as the misdoers By God's sword at your backs! I lent my clay To make your bodies, which had grown more flowers: And now, in change for what I lent, ye give me The thorn to vex, the tempest-fire to cleave me— And I wail! Second Spirit. I wail, I wail! Behold ye that I fasten My sorrow's fang upon your souls dishonoured? Accursed transgressors! down the steep ye hasten,— Your crown's weight on the world, to drag it downward Unto your ruin. Lo! my lions, scenting The blood of wars, roar hoarse and unrelenting— And I wail! First Spirit. I wail, I wail! Do you hear that I wail? I had no part in your transgression—none. My roses on the bough did bud not pale, My rivers did not loiter in the sun; I was obedient. Wherefore in my centre Do I thrill at this curse of death and winter?— Do I wail? Second Spirit. I wail, I wail! I wail in the assault Of undeserved perdition, sorely wounded! My nightingale sang sweet without a fault, My gentle leopards innocently bounded. We were obedient. What is this convulses Our blameless life with pangs and fever pulses? And I wail! Eve. I choose God's thunder and His angels' swords To die by, Adam, rather than such words. Let us pass out and flee. Adam. We cannot flee. This zodiac of the creatures' cruelty Curls round us, like a river cold and drear, And shuts us in, constraining us to hear. First Spirit. I feel your steps, O wandering sinners, strike A sense of death to me, and undug graves! The heart of earth, once calm, is trembling like The ragged foam along the ocean-waves: The restless earthquakes rock against each other; The elements moan 'round me—“Mother, mother”— And I wail! Second Spirit. Your melancholy looks do pierce me through; Corruption swathes the paleness of your beauty. Why have ye done this thing? What did we do That we should fall from bliss as ye from duty? Wild shriek the hawks, in waiting for their jesses, Fierce howl the wolves along the wildernesses— And I wail! Adam. To thee, the Spirit of the harmless earth, To thee, the Spirit of earth's harmless lives, Inferior creatures but still innocent, Be salutation from a guilty mouth Yet worthy of some audience and respect From you who are not guilty. If we have sinned, God hath rebuked us, who is over us To give rebuke or death, and if ye wail Because of any suffering from our sin, Ye who are under and not over us, Be satisfied with God, if not with us, And pass out from our presence in such peace As we have left you, to enjoy revenge Such as the heavens have made you. Verily, There must be strife between us, large as sin. Eve. No strife, mine Adam! Let us not stand high Upon the wrong we did to reach disdain, Who rather should be humbler evermore Since self-made sadder. Adam! shall I speak— I who spake once to such a bitter end— Shall I speak humbly now who once was proud? I, schooled by sin to more humility Than thou hast, O mine Adam, O my king— My king, if not the world's? Adam. Speak as thou wilt. Eve. Thus, then—my hand in thine— . . . Sweet, dreadful Spirits! I pray you humbly in the name of God, Not to say of these tears, which are impure— Grant me such pardoning grace as can go forth From clean volitions toward a spotted will, From the wronged to the wronger, this and no more! I do not ask more. I am 'ware, indeed, That absolute pardon is impossible From you to me, by reason of my sin,— And that I cannot evermore, as once, With worthy acceptation of pure joy, Behold the trances of the holy hills Beneath the leaning stars, or watch the vales Dew-pallid with their morning ecstasy,— Or hear the winds make pastoral peace between Two grassy uplands,—and the river-wells Work out their bubbling mysteries underground,— And all the birds sing, till for joy of song They lift their trembling wings as if to heave The too-much weight of music from their heart And float it up the æther. I am 'ware That these things I can no more apprehend With a pure organ into a full delight,— The sense of beauty and of melody Being no more aided in me by the sense Of personal adjustment to those heights Of what I see well-formed or hear well-tuned, But rather coupled darkly and made ashamed By my percipiency of sin and fall In melancholy of humiliant thoughts. But, oh! fair, dreadful Spirits—albeit this Your accusation must confront my soul, And your pathetic utterance and full gaze Must evermore subdue me,—be content! Conquer me gently—as if pitying me, Not to say loving! let my tears fall thick As watering dews of Eden, unreproached; And when your tongues reprove me, make me smooth, Not ruffled—smooth and still with your reproof, And peradventure better while more sad! For look to it, sweet Spirits, look well to it, It will not be amiss in you who kept The law of your own righteousness, and keep The right of your own griefs to mourn themselves,— To pity me twice fallen, from that, and this, From joy of place, and also right of wail, “I wail” being not for me—only “I sin.” Look to it, O sweet Spirits! For was I not, At that last sunset seen in Paradise, When all the westering clouds flashed out in throngs Of sudden angel-faces, face by face, All hushed and solemn, as a thought of God Held them suspended,—was I not, that hour, The lady of the world, princess of life, Mistress of feast and favour? Could I touch A rose with my white hand, but it became Redder at once? Could I walk leisurely Along our swarded garden, but the grass Tracked me with greenness? Could I stand aside A moment underneath a cornel-tree, But all the leaves did tremble as alive With songs of fifty birds who were made glad Because I stood there? Could I turn to look With these twain eyes of mine, now weeping fast, Now good for only weeping,—upon man, Angel, or beast, or bird, but each rejoiced Because I looked on him? Alas, alas! And is not this much woe, to cry “alas!” Speaking of joy? And is not this more shame, To have made the woe myself, from all that joy? To have stretched my hand, and plucked it from the tree, And chosen it for fruit? Nay, is not this Still most despair,—to have halved that bitter fruit, And ruined, so, the sweetest friend I have, Turning the Greatest to mine enemy? Adam. I will not hear thee speak so. Hearken, Spirits! Our God, who is the enemy of none But only of their sin, hath set your hope And my hope, in a promise, on this Head. Show reverence, then, and never bruise her more With unpermitted and extreme reproach,— Lest, passionate in anguish, she fling down Beneath your trampling feet, God's gift to us Of sovranty by reason and freewill, Sinning against the province of the Soul To rule the soulless. Reverence her estate, And pass out from her presence with no words! Eve. O dearest Heart, have patience with my heart! O Spirits, have patience, 'stead of reverence, And let me speak, for, not being innocent, It little doth become me to be proud, And I am prescient by the very hope And promise set upon me, that henceforth Only my gentleness shall make me great, My humbleness exalt me. Awful Spirits, Be witness that I stand in your reproof But one sun's length off from my happiness— Happy, as I have said, to look around, Clear to look up!—And now! I need not speak— Ye see me what I am; ye scorn me so, Because ye see me what I have made myself From God's best making! Alas,—peace forgone, Love wronged, and virtue forfeit, and tears wept Upon all, vainly! Alas, me! alas, Who have undone myself, from all that best, Fairest and sweetest, to this wretchedest Saddest and most defiled—cast out, cast down— What word metes absolute loss? let absolute loss Suffice you for revenge. For I, who lived Beneath the wings of angels yesterday, Wander to-day beneath the roofless world: I, reigning the earth's empress yesterday, Put off from me, to-day, your hate with prayers: I, yesterday, who answered the Lord God, Composed and glad as singing-birds the sun, Might shriek now from our dismal desert, “God,” And hear him make reply, “What is thy need, Thou whom I cursed to-day?” Adam. Eve! Eve. I, at last, Who yesterday was helpmate and delight Unto mine Adam, am to-day the grief And curse-mete for him. And, so, pity us, Ye gentle Spirits, and pardon him and me, And let some tender peace, made of our pain, Grow up betwixt us, as a tree might grow, With boughs on both sides! In the shade of which, When presently ye shall behold us dead,— For the poor sake of our humility, Breathe out your pardon on our breathless lips, And drop your twilight dews against our brows, And stroking with mild airs our harmless hands Left empty of all fruit, perceive your love Distilling through your pity over us, And suffer it, self-reconciled, to pass! Lucifer rises in the circle. Lucifer. Who talks here of a complement of grief? Of expiation wrought by loss and fall? Of hate subduable to pity? Eve? Take counsel from thy counsellor the snake, And boast no more in grief, nor hope from pain, My docile Eve! I teach you to despond Who taught you disobedience. Look around:— Earth spirits and phantasms hear you talk unmoved, As if ye were red clay again and talked! What are your words to them—your grief to them— Your deaths, indeed, to them? Did the hand pause, For their sake, in the plucking of the fruit, That they should pause for you, in hating you? Or will your grief or death, as did your sin, Bring change upon their final doom? Behold, Your grief is but your sin in the rebound, And cannot expiate for it. Adam. That is true. Lucifer. Ay, that is true. The clay-king testifies To the snake's counsel,—hear him!—very true. Earth Spirits. I wail, I wail! Lucifer. And certes, that is true. Ye wail, ye all wail. Peradventure I Could wail among you. O thou universe, That holdest sin and woe,—more room for wail! Distant Starry Voice. Ah, ah, Heosphoros! Heosphoros! Adam. Mark Lucifer! He changes awfully. Eve. It seems as if he looked from grief to God And could not see him. Wretched Lucifer! Adam. How he stands—yet an angel! Earth Spirits. We all wail! Lucifer (after a pause). Dost thou remember, Adam, when the curse Took us in Eden? On a mountain-peak Half-sheathed in primal woods and glittering In spasms of awful sunshine at that hour, A lion couched, part raised upon his paws, With his calm massive face turned full on thine, And his mane listening. When the ended curse Left silence in the world, right suddenly He sprang up rampant and stood straight and stiff, As if the new reality of death Were dashed against his eyes, and roared so fierce, (Such thick carnivorous passion in his throat Tearing a passage through the wrath and fear) And roared so wild, and smote from all the hills Such fast keen echoes crumbling down the vales Precipitately,—that the forest beasts, One after one, did mutter a response Of savage and of sorrowful complaint Which trailed along the gorges. Then, at once, He fell back, and rolled crashing from the height Into the dusk of pines. Adam. It might have been. I heard the curse alone. Earth Spirits. I wail, I wail! Lucifer. That lion is the type of what I am. And as he fixed thee with his full-faced hate, And roared, O Adam, comprehending doom, So, gazing on the face of the Unseen, I cry out here between the Heavens and Earth My conscience of this sin, this woe, this wrath, Which damn me to this depth. Earth Spirits. I wail, I wail! Eve. I wail—O God! Lucifer. I scorn you that ye wail, Who use your petty griefs for pedestals To stand on, beckoning pity from without, And deal in pathos of antithesis Of what ye were forsooth, and what ye are;— I scorn you like an angel! Yet, one cry I, too, would drive up like a column erect, Marble to marble, from my heart to heaven, A monument of anguish to transpierce And overtop your vapoury complaints Expressed from feeble woes. Earth Spirits. I wail, I wail! Lucifer. For, O ye heavens, ye are my witnesses, That I, struck out from nature in a blot, The outcast and the mildew of things good, The leper of angels, the excepted dust Under the common rain of daily gifts,— I the snake, I the tempter, I the cursed,— To whom the highest and the lowest alike Say, Go from us—we have no need of thee,— Was made by God like others. Good and fair, He did create me!—ask him, if not fair! Ask, if I caught not fair and silverly His blessing for chief angels on my head Until it grew there, a crown crystallized! Ask, if he never called me by my name, Lucifer—kindly said as “Gabriel”— Lucifer—soft as “Michael!” while serene I, standing in the glory of the lamps, Answered “my Father,” innocent of shame And of the sense of thunder. Ha! ye think, White angels in your niches,—I repent, And would tread down my own offences back To service at the footstool? that's read wrong! I cry as the beast did, that I may cry— Expansive, not appealing! Fallen so deep, Against the sides of this prodigious pit I cry—cry—dashing out the hands of wail On each side, to meet anguish everywhere, And to attest it in the ecstasy And exaltation of a woe sustained Because provoked and chosen. Pass along Your wilderness, vain mortals! Puny griefs In transitory shapes, be henceforth dwarfed To your own conscience, by the dread extremes Of what I am and have been. If ye have fallen, It is but a step's fall,—the whole ground beneath Strewn woolly soft with promise! if ye have sinned, Your prayers tread high as angels! if ye have grieved, Ye are too mortal to be pitiable, The power to die disproves the right to grieve. Go to! ye call this ruin? I half-scorn The ill I did you! Were ye wronged by me, Hated and tempted and undone of me,— Still, what's your hurt to mine of doing hurt, Of hating, tempting, and so ruining? This sword's hilt is the sharpest, and cuts through The hand that wields it. Go I curse you all. Hate one another—feebly—as ye can! I would not certes cut you short in hate, Far be it from me! hate on as ye can! I breathe into your faces, spirits of earth, As wintry blast may breathe on wintry leaves And lifting up their brownness show beneath The branches bare. Beseech you, spirits, give To Eve who beggarly entreats your love For her and Adam when they shall be dead, An answer rather fitting to the sin Than to the sorrow—as the heavens, I trow, For justice' sake gave theirs. I curse you both, Adam and Eve. Say grace as after meat, After my curses! May your tears fall hot On all the hissing scorns o' the creatures here,— And yet rejoice! Increase and multiply, Ye in your generations, in all plagues, Corruptions, melancholies, poverties, And hideous forms of life and fears of death,— The thought of death being alway imminent, Immovable and dreadful in your life, And deafly and dumbly insignificant Of any hope beyond,—as death itself, Whichever of you lieth dead the first, Shall seem to the survivor—yet rejoice! My curse catch at you strongly, body and soul, And He find no redemption—nor the wing Of seraph move your way; and yet rejoice! Rejoice,—because ye have not, set in you, This hate which shall pursue you—this fire-hate Which glares without, because it burns within— Which kills from ashes—this potential hate, Wherein I, angel, in antagonism To God and his reflex beatitudes, Moan ever, in the central universe, With the great woe of striving against Love— And gasp for space amid the Infinite, And toss for rest amid the Desertness, Self-orphaned by my will, and self-elect To kingship of resistant agony Toward the Good round me—hating good and love, And willing to hate good and to hate love, And willing to will on so evermore, Scorning the past and damning the to-come— Go and rejoice! I curse you. [Lucifer vanishes. Earth Spirits. And we scorn you! there's no pardon Which can lean to you aright. When your bodies take the guerdon Of the death-curse in our sight, Then the bee that hummeth lowest shall transcend you: Then ye shall not move an eyelid Though the stars look down your eyes; And the earth which ye defilèd Shall expose you to the skies,— “Lo! these kings of ours, who sought to comprehend you.” First Spirit. And the elements shall boldly All your dust to dust constrain. Unresistedly and coldly I will smite you with my rain. From the slowest of my frosts is no receding. Second Spirit. And my little worm, appointed To assume a royal part, He shall reign, crowned and anointed, O'er the noble human heart. Give him counsel against losing of that Eden! Adam. Do ye scorn us? Back your scorn Toward your faces grey and lorn, As the wind drives back the rain, Thus I drive with passion-strife, I who stand beneath God's sun, Made like God, and, though undone, Not unmade for love and life. Lo! ye utter threats in vain. By my free will that chose sin, By mine agony within Round the passage of the fire, By the pinings which disclose That my native soul is higher Than what it chose, We are yet too high, O Spirits, for your disdain! Eve. Nay, beloved! If these be low, We confront them from no height. We have stooped down to their level By infecting them with evil, And their scorn that meets our blow Scathes aright. Amen. Let it be so. Earth Spirits. We shall triumph—triumph greatly When ye lie beneath the sward. There, our lily shall grow stately Though ye answer not a word, And her fragrance shall be scornful of your silence: While your throne ascending calmly We, in heirdom of your soul, Flash the river, lift the palm-tree, The dilated ocean roll, By the thoughts that throbbed within you, round the islands. Alp and torrent shall inherit Your significance of will, And the grandeur of your spirit Shall our broad savannahs fill; In our winds, your exultations shall be springing! Even your parlance which inveigles, By our rudeness shall be won. Hearts poetic in our eagles Shall beat up against the sun And strike downward in articulate clear singing. Your bold speeches our Behemoth With his thunderous jaw shall wield. Your high fancies shall our Mammoth Breathe sublimely up the shield Of Saint Michael at God's throne, who waits to speed him: Till the heavens' smooth-groovèd thunder Spinning back, shall leave them clear, And the angels, smiling wonder, With dropt looks from sphere to sphere, Shall cry “Ho, ye heirs of Adam! ye exceed him.” Adam. Root out thine eyes, Sweet, from the dreary ground! Beloved, we may be overcome by God, But not by these. Eve. By God, perhaps, in these. Adam. I think, not so. Had God foredoomed despair He had not spoken hope. He may destroy Certes, but not deceive. Eve. Behold this rose! I plucked it in our bower of Paradise This morning as I went forth, and my heart Has beat against its petals all the day. I thought it would be always red and full As when I plucked it. Is it?—ye may see! I cast it down to you that ye may see, All of you!—count the petals lost of it, And note the colours fainted! ye may see! And I am as it is, who yesterday Grew in the same place. O ye spirits of earth, I almost, from my miserable heart, Could here upbraid you for your cruel heart, Which will not let me, down the slope of death, Draw any of your pity after me, Or lie still in the quiet of your looks, As my flower, there, in mine. [A bleak wind, quickened with indistinct Human Voices, spins around the Earth-zodiac, filling the circle with its presence; and then, wailing off into the East, carries the rose away with it. Eve falls upon her face. Adam stands erect. Adam. So, verily, The last departs. Eve. So Memory follows Hope, And Life both. Love said to me, “Do not die,” And I replied, “O Love, I will not die. I exiled and I will not orphan Love.” But now it is no choice of mine to die: My heart throbs from me. Adam. Call it straightway back! Death's consummation crowns completed life, Or comes too early. Hope being set on thee For others, if for others then for thee,— For thee and me. [The wind revolves from the East, and round again to the East, perfumed by the Eden rose, and full of Voices which sweep out into articulation as they pass. Let thy soul shake its leaves To feel the mystic wind—hark! Eve. I hear life. Infant Voices passing in the wind. O we live, O we live— And this life that we receive Is a warm thing and a new, Which we softly bud into From the heart and from the brain,— Something strange that overmuch is Of the sound and of the sight, Flowing round in trickling touches, With a sorrow and delight,— Yet is it all in vain? Rock us softly, Lest it be all in vain. Youthful Voices passing. O we live, O we live— And this life that we achieve Is a loud thing and a bold Which with pulses manifold Strikes the heart out full and fain— Active doer, noble liver, Strong to struggle, sure to conquer, Though the vessel's prow will quiver At the lifting of the anchor: Yet do we strive in vain? Infant Voices passing. Rock us softly, Lest it be all in vain. Poet Voices passing. O we live, O we live— And this life that we conceive Is a clear thing and a fair, Which we set in crystal air That its beauty may be plain! With a breathing and a flooding Of the heaven-life on the whole, While we hear the forests budding To the music of the soul— Yet is it tuned in vain? Infant Voices passing. Rock us softly, Lest it be all in vain. Philosophic Voices passing. O we live, O we live— And this life that we perceive Is a great thing and a grave Which for others' use we have, Duty-laden to remain. We are helpers, fellow-creatures, Of the right against the wrong; We are earnest-hearted teachers Of the truth which maketh strong— Yet do we teach in vain? Infant Voices passing. Rock us softly, Lest it be all in vain. Revel Voices passing. O we live, O we live— And this life that we reprieve Is a low thing and a light, Which is jested out of sight And made worthy of disdain! Strike with bold electric laughter The high tops of things divine— Turn thy head, my brother, after, Lest thy tears fall in my wine! For is all laughed in vain? Infant Voices passing. Rock us softly, Lest it be all in vain? Eve. I hear a sound of life—of life like ours— Of laughter and of wailing, of grave speech, Of little plaintive voices innocent, Of life in separate courses flowing out Like our four rivers to some outward main. I hear life—life! Adam. And, so, thy cheeks have snatched Scarlet to paleness, and thine eyes drink fast Of glory from full cups, and thy moist lips Seem trembling, both of them, with earnest doubts Whether to utter words or only smile. Eve. Shall I be mother of the coming life? Hear the steep generations, how they fall Adown the visionary stairs of Time Like supernatural thunders—far, yet near,— Sowing their fiery echoes through the hills. Am I a cloud to these—mother to these? Earth Spirits. And bringer of the curse upon all these. [Eve sinks down again. Poet Voices passing. O we live, O we live— And this life that we conceive Is a noble thing and high, Which we climb up loftily To view God without a stain; Till, recoiling where the shade is, We retread our steps again, And descend the gloomy Hades To resume man's mortal pain. Shall it be climbed in vain? Infant Voices passing. Rock us softly, Lest it be all in vain. Love Voices passing. O we live, O we live— And this life we would retrieve, Is a faithful thing apart Which we love in, heart to heart, Until one heart fitteth twain. “Wilt thou be one with me?” “I will be one with thee.” “Ha, ha!—we love and live!” Alas! ye love and die. Shriek—who shall reply? For is it not loved in vain? Infant Voices passing. Rock us softly, Though it be all in vain. Aged Voices passing. O we live, O we live— And this life we would survive, Is a gloomy thing and brief, Which, consummated in grief, Leaveth ashes for all gain. Is it not all in vain? Infant Voices passing. Rock us softly, Though it be all in vain. [Voices die away. Earth Spirits. And bringer of the curse upon all these. Eve. The voices of foreshown Humanity Die off;—so let me die. Adam. So let us die, When God's will soundeth the right hour of death. Earth Spirits. And bringer of the curse upon all these. Eve. O Spirits! by the gentleness ye use In winds at night, and floating clouds at noon, In gliding waters under lily-leaves, In chirp of crickets, and the settling hush A bird makes in her nest with feet and wings,— Fulfil your natures now! Earth Spirits. Agreed, allowed! We gather out our natures like a cloud, And thus fulfil their lightnings! Thus, and thus! Hearken, oh hearken to us! First Spirit. As the storm-wind blows bleakly from the norland, As the snow-wind beats blindly on the moorland, As the simoom drives hot across the desert, As the thunder roars deep in the Unmeasured, As the torrent tears the ocean-world to atoms, As the whirlpool grinds it fathoms below fathoms, Thus,—and thus! Second Spirit. As the yellow toad, that spits its poison chilly, As the tiger, in the jungle crouching stilly, As the wild boar, with ragged tusks of anger, As the wolf-dog, with teeth of glittering clangour, As the vultures, that scream against the thunder, As the owlets, that sit and moan asunder, Thus,—and thus! Eve. Adam! God! Adam. Cruel, unrelenting Spirits! By the power in me of the sovran soul Whose thoughts keep pace yet with the angel's march, I charge you into silence—trample you Down to obedience. I am king of you! Earth Spirits. Ha, ha! thou art king! With a sin for a crown, And a soul undone! Thou, the antagonized, Tortured and agonized, Held in the ring Of the zodiac! Now, king, beware! We are many and strong Whom thou standest among,— And we press on the air, And we stifle thee back, And we multiply where Thou wouldst trample us down From rights of our own To an utter wrong— And, from under the feet of thy scorn, O forlorn, We shall spring up like corn, And our stubble be strong. Adam. God, there is power in thee! I make appeal Unto thy kingship. Eve. There is pity in Thee, O sinned against, great God!—My seed, my seed, There is hope set on Thee—I cry to thee, Thou mystic Seed that shalt be!—leave us not In agony beyond what we can bear, Fallen in debasement below thunder-mark, A mark for scorning—taunted and perplext By all these creatures we ruled yesterday, Whom thou, Lord, rulest alway! O my Seed, Through the tempestuous years that rain so thick Betwixt my ghostly vision and thy face, Let me have token! for my soul is bruised Before the serpent's head is. [A vision of Christ appears in the midst of the Zodiac, which pales before the heavenly light. The Earth Spirits grow greyer and fainter. Christ. I am here! Adam. This is God!—Curse us not, God, any more! Eve. But gazing so—so—with omnific eyes, Lift my soul upward till it touch thy feet! Or lift it only,—not to seem too proud,— To the low height of some good angel's feet, For such to tread on when he walketh straight And thy lips praise him! Christ. Spirits of the earth, I meet you with rebuke for the reproach And cruel and unmitigated blame Ye cast upon your masters. True, they have sinned; And true their sin is reckoned into loss For you the sinless. Yet, your innocence Which of you praises? since God made your acts Inherent in your lives, and bound your hands With instincts and imperious sanctities From self-defacement. Which of you disdains These sinners who in falling proved their height Above you by their liberty to fall? And which of you complains of loss by them, For whose delight and use ye have your life And honour in creation? Ponder it! This regent and sublime Humanity, Though fallen, exceeds you! this shall film your sun, Shall hunt your lightning to its lair of cloud, Turn back your rivers, footpath all your seas, Lay flat your forests, master with a look Your lion at his fasting, and fetch down Your eagle flying. Nay, without this law Of mandom, ye would perish,—beast by beast Devouring,—tree by tree, with strangling roots And trunks set tuskwise. Ye would gaze on God With imperceptive blankness up the stars, And mutter, “Why, God, hast thou made us thus?” And pining to a sallow idiocy Stagger up blindly against the ends of life, Then stagnate into rottenness and drop Heavily—poor, dead matter—piecemeal down The abysmal spaces—like a little stone Let fall to chaos. Therefore over you Receive man's sceptre!—therefore be content To minister with voluntary grace And melancholy pardon, every rite And function in you, to the human hand! Be ye to man as angels are to God, Servants in pleasure, singers of delight, Suggesters to his soul of higher things Than any of your highest! So at last, He shall look round on you with lids too straight To hold the grateful tears, and thank you well, And bless you when he prays his secret prayers, And praise you when he sings his open songs For the clear song-note he has learnt in you Of purifying sweetness, and extend Across your head his golden fantasies Which glorify you into soul from sense. Go, serve him for such price! That not in vain Nor yet ignobly ye shall serve, I place My word here for an oath, mine oath for act To be hereafter. In the name of which Perfect redemption and perpetual grace, I bless you through the hope and through the peace Which are mine,—to the Love, which is myself. Eve. Speak on still, Christ! Albeit thou bless me not In set words, I am blessed in hearkening thee— Speak, Christ! Christ. Speak, Adam! Bless the woman, man! It is thine office. Adam. Mother of the world, Take heart before this Presence! Lo, my voice, Which, naming erst the creatures, did express (God breathing through my breath) the attributes And instincts of each creature in its name, Floats to the same afflatus,—floats and heaves Like a water-weed that opens to a wave,— A full-leaved prophecy affecting thee, Out fairly and wide. Henceforward, arise, aspire To all the calms and magnanimities, The lofty uses and the noble ends, The sanctified devotion and full work, To which thou art elect for evermore, First woman, wife, and mother! Eve. And first in sin. Adam. And also the sole bearer of the Seed Whereby sin dieth. Raise the majesties Of thy disconsolate brows, O well-beloved, And front with level eyelids the To-come, And all the dark o' the world! Rise, woman, rise To thy peculiar and best altitudes Of doing good and of enduring ill, Of comforting for ill, and teaching good, And reconciling all that ill and good Unto the patience of a constant hope,— Rise with thy daughters! If sin came by thee, And by sin, death,—the ransom-righteousness, The heavenly life and compensative rest Shall come by means of thee. If woe by thee Had issue to the world, thou shalt go forth An angel of the woe thou didst achieve, Found acceptable to the world instead Of others of that name, of whose bright steps Thy deed stripped bare the hills. Be satisfied; Something thou hast to bear through womanhood, Peculiar suffering answering to the sin,— Some pang paid down for each new human life, Some weariness in guarding such a life, Some coldness from the guarded, some mistrust From those thou hast too well served, from those beloved Too loyally some treason; feebleness Within thy heart, and cruelty without, And pressures of an alien tyranny With its dynastic reasons of larger bones And stronger sinews. But, go to! thy love Shall chant itself its own beatitudes After its own life-working. A child's kiss Set on thy sighing lips shall make thee glad; A poor man served by thee shall make thee rich; A sick man helped by thee shall make thee strong; Thou shalt be served thyself by every sense Of service which thou renderest. Such a crown I set upon thy head,—Christ witnessing With looks of prompting love—to keep thee clear Of all reproach against the sin forgone, From all the generations which succeed. Thy hand which plucked the apple I clasp close, Thy lips which spake wrong counsel I kiss close, I bless thee in the name of Paradise And by the memory of Edenic joys Forfeit and lost,—by that last cypress tree, Green at the gate, which thrilled as we came out, And by the blessèd nightingale which threw Its melancholy music after us,— And by the flowers, whose spirits full of smells Did follow softly, plucking us behind Back to the gradual banks and vernal bowers And fourfold river-courses.—By all these, I bless thee to the contraries of these, I bless thee to the desert and the thorns, To the elemental change and turbulence, And to the roar of the estrangèd beasts, And to the solemn dignities of grief,— To each one of these ends,—and to their end Of Death and the hereafter. Eve. I accept For me and for my daughters this high part Which lowly shall be counted. Noble work Shall hold me in the place of garden-rest, And in the place of Eden's lost delight Worthy endurance of permitted pain; While on my longest patience there shall wait Death's speechless angel, smiling in the east, Whence cometh the cold wind. I bow myself Humbly henceforward on the ill I did, That humbleness may keep it in the shade. Shall it be so? shall I smile, saying so? O Seed! O King! O God, who shalt be seed,— What shall I say? As Eden's fountains swelled Brightly betwixt their banks, so swells my soul Betwixt thy love and power! And, sweetest thoughts Of forgone Eden! now, for the first time Since God said “Adam,” walking through the trees, I dare to pluck you as I plucked erewhile The lily or pink, the rose or heliotrope. So pluck I you—so largely—with both hands, And throw you forward on the outer earth, Wherein we are cast out, to sweeten it. Adam. As thou, Christ, to illume it, holdest Heaven Broadly over our heads. [The Christ is gradually transfigured, during the following phrases of dialogue, into humanity and suffering. Eve. O Saviour Christ, Thou standest mute in glory, like the sun! Adam. We worship in Thy silence, Saviour Christ! Eve. Thy brows grow grander with a forecast woe,— Diviner, with the possible of death. We worship in Thy sorrow, Saviour Christ! Adam. How do Thy clear, still eyes transpierce our souls, As gazing through them toward the Father-throne In a pathetical, full Deity, Serenely as the stars gaze through the air Straight on each other! Eve. O pathetic Christ, Thou standest mute in glory, like the moon! Christ. Eternity stands alway fronting God; A stern colossal image, with blind eyes And grand dim lips that murmur evermore God, God, God! while the rush of life and death, The roar of act and thought, of evil and good, The avalanches of the ruining worlds Tolling down space,—the new worlds' genesis Budding in fire,—the gradual humming growth Of the ancient atoms and first forms of earth, The slow procession of the swathing seas And firmamental waters,—and the noise Of the broad, fluent strata of pure airs,— All these flow onward in the intervals Of that reiterated sound of—God! Which word innumerous angels straightway lift Wide on celestial altitudes of song And choral adoration, and then drop The burden softly, shutting the last notes In silver wings. Howbeit in the noon of time Eternity shall wax as dumb as Death, While a new voice beneath the spheres shall cry, “God! why hast thou forsaken me, my God?” And not a voice in Heaven shall answer it. [The transfiguration is complete in sadness. Adam. Thy speech is of the Heavenlies, yet, O Christ, Awfully human are thy voice and face! Eve. My nature overcomes me from thine eyes. Christ. In the set noon of time shall one from Heaven, An angel fresh from looking upon God, Descend before a woman, blessing her With perfect benediction of pure love, For all the world in all its elements, For all the creatures of earth, air, and sea, For all men in the body and in the soul, Unto all ends of glory and sanctity. Eve. O pale, pathetic Christ—I worship thee! I thank thee for that woman! Christ. Then, at last, I, wrapping round me your humanity, Which, being sustained, shall neither break nor burn Beneath the fire of Godhead, will tread earth, And ransom you and it, and set strong peace Betwixt you and its creatures. With my pangs I will confront your sins; and since those sins Have sunken to all Nature's heart from yours, The tears of my clean soul shall follow them And set a holy passion to work clear Absolute consecration. In my brow Of kingly whiteness shall be crowned anew Your discrowned human nature. Look on me! As I shall be uplifted on a cross In darkness of eclipse and anguish dread, So shall I lift up in my piercèd hands, Not into dark, but light—not unto death, But life,—beyond the reach of guilt and grief, The whole creation. Henceforth in my name Take courage, O thou woman,—man, take hope! Your grave shall be as smooth as Eden's sward, Beneath the steps of your prospective thoughts, And, one step past it, a new Eden-gate Shall open on a hinge of harmony And let you through to mercy. Ye shall fall No more, within that Eden, nor pass out Any more from it. In which hope, move on, First sinners and first mourners! Live and love,— Doing both nobly because lowlily! Live and work, strongly because patiently! And, for the deed of death, trust it to God That it be well done, unrepented of, And not to loss! And thence, with constant prayers, Fasten your souls so high, that constantly The smile of your heroic cheer may float Above all floods of earthly agonies, Purification being the joy of pain! [The vision of Christ vanishes. Adam and Eve stand in an ecstasy. The Earth-zodiac pales away shade by shade, as the stars, star by star, shine out in the sky; and the following chant from the two Earth Spirits (as they sweep back into the Zodiac and disappear with it) accompanies the process of change. Earth Spirits. By the mighty word thus spoken Both for living and for dying, We our homage-oath, once broken, Fasten back again in sighing, And the creatures and the elements renew their covenanting Here, forgive us all our scorning; Here, we promise milder duty: And the evening and the morning Shall re-organise in beauty A sabbath day of sabbath joy, for universal chanting. And if, still, this melancholy May be strong to overcome us, If this mortal and unholy We still fail to cast out from us, If we turn upon you, unaware, your own dark influences,— If ye tremble when surrounded By our forest pine and palm trees, If we cannot cure the wounded With our gum trees and our balm trees, And if your souls all mournfully sit down among your senses,— Yet, O mortals, do not fear us! We are gentle in our languor; Much more good ye shall have near us Than any pain or anger, And our God's refracted blessing in our blessing shall be given. By the desert's endless vigil We will solemnise your passions, By the wheel of the black eagle We will teach you exaltations, When he sails against the wind, to the white spot up in heaven. Ye shall find us tender nurses To your weariness of nature, And our hands shall stroke the curse's Dreary furrows from the creature, Till your bodies shall lie smooth in death and straight and slumberful. Then, a couch we will provide you Where no summer heats shall dazzle, Strewing on you and beside you Thyme and rosemary and basil, And the yew-tree shall grow overhead to keep all safe and cool. Till the Holy Blood awaited Shall be chrism around us running, Whereby, newly-consecrated, We shall leap up in God's sunning, To join the spheric company which purer worlds assemble: While, renewed by new evangels, Soul-consummated, made glorious, Ye shall brighten past the angels, Ye shall kneel to Christ victorious, And the rays around his feet beneath your sobbing lips shall tremble. [The phantastic Vision has all passed; the Earth-zodiac has broken like a belt, and is dissolved from the Desert. The Earth Spirits vanish, and the stars shine out above. CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS While Adam and Eve advance into the Desert, hand in hand. Hear our heavenly promise Through your mortal passion! Love, ye shall have from us, In a pure relation. As a fish or bird Swims or flies, if moving, We unseen are heard To live on by loving. Far above the glances Of your eager eyes, Listen! we are loving. Listen, through man's ignorances— Listen, through God's mysteries- Listen down the heart of things, Ye shall hear our mystic wings Murmurous with loving. Through the opal door Listen evermore How we live by loving! First Semichorus. When your bodies therefore Reach the grave their goal, Softly will we care for Each enfranchised soul. Softly and unlothly Through the door of opal Toward the heavenly people, Floated on a minor fine Into the full chant divine, We will draw you smoothly,— While the human in the minor Makes the harmony diviner. Listen to our loving! Second Semichorus. There, a sough of glory Shall breathe on you as you come, Ruffling round the doorway All the light of angeldom. From the empyrean centre Heavenly voices shall repeat, “Souls redeemed and pardoned, enter, For the chrism on you is sweet!” And every angel in the place Lowlily shall bow his face, Folded fair on softened sounds, Because upon your hands and feet He images his Master's wounds. Listen to our loving! First Semichorus. So, in the universe's Consummated undoing, Our seraphs of white mercies Shall hover round the ruin. Their wings shall stream upon the flame As if incorporate of the same In elemental fusion; And calm their faces shall burn out With a pale and mastering thought, And a steadfast looking of desire From out between the clefts of fire,— While they cry, in the Holy's name, To the final Restitution. Listen to our loving! Second Semichorus. So, when the day of God is To the thick graves accompted, Awaking the dead bodies, The angel of the trumpet Shall split and shatter the earth To the roots of the grave— Which never before were slackened— And quicken the charnel birth With his blast so clear and brave That the Dead shall start and stand erect, And every face of the burial-place Shall the awful, single look reflect Wherewith he them awakened. Listen to our loving! First Semichorus. But wild is the horse of Death! He will leap up wild at the clamour Above and beneath. And where is his Tamer On that last day, When he crieth Ha, ha! To the trumpet's blare, And paweth the earth's Aceldama? When he tosseth his head, The drear-white steed, And ghastlily champeth the last moon-ray— What angel there Can lead him away, That the living may rule for the Dead? Second Semichorus. Yet a Tamer shall be found! One more bright than seraph crowned, And more strong than cherub bold, Elder, too, than angel old, By his grey eternities. He shall master and surprise The steed of Death. For He is strong, and He is fain. He shall quell him with a breath, And shall lead him where He will, With a whisper in the ear, Full of fear, And a hand upon the mane, Grand and still. First Semichorus. Through the flats of Hades where the souls assemble He will guide the Death-steed calm between their ranks, While, like beaten dogs, they a little moan and tremble To see the darkness curdle from the horse's glittering flanks. Through the flats of Hades where the dreary shade is, Up the steep of heaven will the Tamer guide the steed,— Up the spheric circles, circle above circle, We who count the ages shall count the tolling tread— Every hoof-fall striking a blinder blanker sparkle From the stony orbs, which shall show as they were dead. Second Semichorus. All the way the Death-steed with tolling hoofs shall travel, Ashen-grey the planets shall be motionless as stones, Loosely shall the systems eject their parts coæval, Stagnant in the spaces shall float the pallid moons: Suns that touch their apogees, reeling from their level, Shall run back on their axles, in wild low broken tunes. Chorus. Up against the arches of the crystal ceiling, From the horse's nostrils shall stream the blurting breath: Up between the angels pale with silent feeling Will the Tamer calmly lead the horse of Death. Semichorus. Cleaving all that silence, cleaving all that glory, Will the Tamer lead him straightway to the Throne; “Look out, O Jehovah, to this I bring before Thee, With a hand nail-piercèd, I who am thy Son.” Then the Eye Divinest, from the Deepest, flaming, On the mystic courser shall look out in fire: Blind the beast shall stagger where It overcame him, Meek as lamb at pasture, bloodless in desire. Down the beast shall shiver,—slain amid the taming,— And, by Life essential, the phantasm Death expire. Chorus. Listen, man, through life and death, Through the dust and through the breath, Listen down the heart of things! Ye shall hear our mystic wings Murmurous with loving. A Voice from below. Gabriel, thou Gabriel! A Voice from above. What wouldst thou with me? First Voice. I heard thy voice sound in the angels' song, And I would give thee question. Second Voice. Question me! First Voice. Why have I called thrice to my Morning Star And had no answer? All the stars are out, And answer in their places. Only in vain I cast my voice against the outer rays Of my Star shut in light behind the sun. No more reply than from a breaking string, Breaking when touched. Or is she not my star? Where is my Star—my Star? Have ye cast down Her glory like my glory? Has she waxed Mortal, like Adam? Has she learnt to hate Like any angel? Second Voice. She is sad for thee. All things grow sadder to thee, one by one. Angel Chorus. Live, work on, O Earthy! By the Actual's tension, Speed the arrow worthy Of a pure ascension! From the low earth round you, Reach the heights above you: From the stripes that wound you, Seek the loves that love you! God's divinest burneth plain Through the crystal diaphane Of our loves that love you. First Voice. Gabriel, O Gabriel! Second Voice. What wouldst thou with me? First Voice. Is it true, O thou Gabriel, that the crown Of sorrow which I claimed, another claims? That He claims that too? Second Voice. Lost one, it is true. First Voice. That He will be an exile from his heaven, To lead those exiles homeward? Second Voice. It is true. First Voice. That He will be an exile by his will, As I by mine election? Second Voice. It is true. First Voice. That I shall stand sole exile finally,— Made desolate for fruition? Second Voice. It is true. First Voice. Gabriel! Second Voice. I hearken. First Voice. Is it true besides— Aright true—that mine orient Star will give Her name of “Bright and Morning-Star” to Him,— And take the fairness of his virtue back To cover loss and sadness? Second Voice. It is true. First Voice. Untrue, Untrue! O Morning Star, O Mine, Who sittest secret in a veil of light Far up the starry spaces, say—Untrue! Speak but so loud as doth a wasted moon To Tyrrhene waters. I am Lucifer. [A pause. Silence in the stars. All things grow sadder to me, one by one. Angel Chorus. Exiled human creatures, Let your hope grow larger! Larger grows the vision Of the new delight. From this chain of Nature's God is the Discharger, And the Actual's prison Opens to your sight. Semichorus. Calm the stars and golden In a light exceeding: What their rays have measured Let your feet fulfil! These are stars beholden By your eyes in Eden, Yet, across the desert, See them shining still! Chorus. Future joy and far light Working such relations, Hear us singing gently Exiled is not lost! God, above the starlight, God, above the patience, Shall at last present ye Guerdons worth the cost. Patiently enduring, Painfully surrounded, Listen how we love you, Hope the uttermost! Waiting for that curing Which exalts the wounded, Hear us sing above you— Exiled, but not lost! [The stars shine on brightly while Adam and Eve pursue their way into the far wilderness. There is a sound through the silence, as of the falling tears of an angel. SONNETS. THE SOUL'S EXPRESSION. With stammering lips and insufficient sound I strive and struggle to deliver right That music of my nature, day and night With dream and thought and feeling interwound, And inly answering all the senses round With octaves of a mystic depth and height Which step out grandly to the infinite From the dark edges of the sensual ground. This song of soul I struggle to outbear Through portals of the sense, sublime and whole, And utter all myself into the air: But if I did it,—as the thunder-roll Breaks its own cloud, my flesh would perish there, Before that dread apocalypse of soul. THE SERAPH AND POET. The seraph sings before the manifest God-One, and in the burning of the Seven, And with the full life of consummate Heaven Heaving beneath him like a mother's breast Warm with her first-born's slumber in that nest. The poet sings upon the earth grave-riven, Before the naughty world, soon self-forgiven For wronging him,—and in the darkness prest From his own soul by worldly weights. Even so, Sing, seraph with the glory! heaven is high; Sing, poet with the sorrow! earth is low: The universe's inward voices cry “Amen” to either song of joy and woe: Sing, seraph,—poet,—sing on equally! ON A PORTRAIT OF WORDSWORTH BY B. R. HAYDON. Wordsworth upon Helvellyn! Let the cloud Ebb audibly along the mountain-wind Then break against the rock, and show behind The lowland valleys floating up to crowd The sense with beauty. He with forehead bowed And humble-lidded eyes, as one inclined Before the sovran thought of his own mind, And very meek with inspirations proud, Takes here his rightful place as poet-priest By the high altar, singing prayer and prayer To the higher Heavens. A noble vision free Our Haydon's hand has flung out from the mist: No portrait this, with Academic air! This is the poet and his poetry. PAST AND FUTURE. My future will not copy fair my past On any leaf but Heaven's. Be fully done, Supernal Will! I would not fain be one Who, satisfying thirst and breaking fast, Upon the fulness of the heart at last Says no grace after meat. My wine has run Indeed out of my cup, and there is none To gather up the bread of my repast Scattered and trampled; yet I find some good In earth's green herbs, and streams that bubble up Clear from the darkling ground,—content until I sit with angels before better food: Dear Christ! when Thy new vintage fills my cup, This hand shall shake no more, nor that wine spill. IRREPARABLENESS. I have been in the meadows all the day And gathered there the nosegay that you see, Singing within myself as bird or bee When such do field-work on a morn of May. But, now I look upon my flowers, decay Has met them in my hands more fatally Because more warmly clasped,—and sobs are free To come instead of songs. What do you say, Sweet counsellors, dear friends? that I should go Back straightway to the fields and gather more? Another, sooth, may do it, but not I! My heart is very tired, my strength is low, My hands are full of blossoms plucked before, Held dead within them till myself shall die. TEARS. Thank God, bless God, all ye who suffer not More grief than ye can weep for. That is well— That is light grieving! lighter, none befell Since Adam forfeited the primal lot. Tears! what are tears? The babe weeps in its cot, The mother singing; at her marriage-bell The bride weeps, and before the oracle Of high-faned hills the poet has forgot Such moisture on his cheeks. Thank God for grace, Ye who weep only! If, as some have done, Ye grope tear-blinded in a desert place And touch but tombs,—look up! those tears will run Soon in long rivers down the lifted face, And leave the vision clear for stars and sun. GRIEF. I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless; That only men incredulous of despair, Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air Beat upward to God's throne in loud access Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness, In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare Of the absolute Heavens. Deep-hearted man, express Grief for thy Dead in silence like to death— Most like a monumental statue set In everlasting watch and moveless woe Till itself crumble to the dust beneath. Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet: If it could weep, it could arise and go. SUBSTITUTION. When some belovèd voice that was to you Both sound and sweetness, faileth suddenly, And silence, against which you dare not cry, Aches round you like a strong disease and new— What hope? what help? what music will undo That silence to your sense? Not friendship's sigh, Not reason's subtle count; not melody Of viols, nor of pipes that Faunus blew; Not songs of poets, nor of nightingales Whose hearts leap upward through the cypress-trees To the clear moon; nor yet the spheric laws Self-chanted, nor the angels' sweet “All hails,” Met in the smile of God: nay, none of these. Speak Thou, availing Christ!—and fill this pause. COMFORT. Speak low to me, my Saviour, low and sweet From out the hallelujahs, sweet and low, Lest I should fear and fall, and miss Thee so Who art not missed by any that entreat. Speak to me as to Mary at Thy feet! And if no precious gums my hands bestow, Let my tears drop like amber while I go In reach of Thy divinest voice complete In humanest affection—thus, in sooth, To lose the sense of losing. As a child, Whose song-bird seeks the wood for evermore, Is sung to in its stead by mother's mouth Till, sinking on her breast, love-reconciled, He sleeps the faster that he wept before. PERPLEXED MUSIC. AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED TO E. J. Experience, like a pale musician, holds A dulcimer of patience in his hand, Whence harmonies, we cannot understand, Of God's will in His worlds, the strain unfolds In sad, perplexèd minors: deathly colds Fall on us while we hear, and countermand Our sanguine heart back from the fancy-land With nightingales in visionary wolds. We murmur “Where is any certain tune Or measured music in such notes as these?” But angels, leaning from the golden seat, Are not so minded; their fine ear hath won The issue of completed cadences, And, smiling down the stars, they whisper—Sweet. WORK. What are we set on earth for? Say, to toil; Nor seek to leave thy tending of the vines For all the heat o' the day, till it declines, And Death's mild curfew shall from work assoil. God did anoint thee with His odorous oil, To wrestle, not to reign; and He assigns All thy tears over, like pure crystallines, For younger fellow-workers of the soil To wear for amulets. So others shall Take patience, labour, to their heart and hand, From thy hand and thy heart and thy brave cheer, And God's grace fructify through thee to all. The least flower with a brimming cup may stand, And share its dew-drop with another near. FUTURITY. And, O belovèd voices, upon which Ours passionately call because erelong Ye brake off in the middle of that song We sang together softly, to enrich The poor world with the sense of love, and witch The heart out of things evil,—I am strong, Knowing ye are not lost for aye among The hills, with last year's thrush. God keeps a niche In Heaven to hold our idols; and albeit He brake them to our faces and denied That our close kisses should impair their white, I know we shall behold them raised, complete, The dust swept from their beauty,—glorified New Memnons singing in the great God-light. THE TWO SAYINGS. Two sayings of the Holy Scriptures beat Like pulses in the Church's brow and breast; And by them we find rest in our unrest And, heart-deep in salt tears, do yet entreat God's fellowship as if on heavenly seat. The first is Jesus wept,—whereon is prest Full many a sobbing face that drops its best And sweetest waters on the record sweet: And one is where the Christ, denied and scorned, Looked upon Peter. Oh, to render plain, By help of having loved a little and mourned, That look of sovran love and sovran pain Which He, who could not sin yet suffered, turned On him who could reject but not sustain! THE LOOK. The Saviour looked on Peter. Ay, no word, No gesture of reproach; the Heavens serene Though heavy with armed justice, did not lean Their thunders that way: the forsaken Lord Looked only, on the traitor. None record What that look was, none guess; for those who have seen Wronged lovers loving through a death-pang keen, Or pale-cheeked martyrs smiling to a sword, Have missed Jehovah at the judgment-call. And Peter, from the height of blasphemy— “I never knew this man”—did quail and fall As knowing straight that God; and turnèd free And went out speechless from the face of all, And filled the silence, weeping bitterly. THE MEANING OF THE LOOK. I think that look of Christ might seem to say— “Thou Peter! art thou then a common stone Which I at last must break my heart upon, For all God's charge to His high angels may Guard my foot better? Did I yesterday Wash thy feet, my beloved, that they should run Quick to deny me 'neath the morning sun? And do thy kisses, like the rest, betray? The cock crows coldly.—Go, and manifest A late contrition, but no bootless fear! For when thy final need is dreariest, Thou shalt not be denied, as I am here; My voice to God and angels shall attest, Because I know this man, let him be clear.” A THOUGHT FOR A LONELY DEATH-BED. INSCRIBED TO MY FRIEND E. C. If God compel thee to this destiny, To die alone, with none beside thy bed To ruffle round with sobs thy last word said And mark with tears the pulses ebb from thee,— Pray then alone, “O Christ, come tenderly! By Thy forsaken Sonship in the red Drear wine-press,—by the wilderness outspread,— And the lone garden where Thine agony Fell bloody from Thy brow,—by all of those Permitted desolations, comfort mine! No earthly friend being near me, interpose No deathly angel 'twixt my face and Thine, But stoop Thyself to gather my life's rose, And smile away my mortal to Divine!” WORK AND CONTEMPLATION. The woman singeth at her spinning-wheel A pleasant chant, ballad or barcarole; She thinketh of her song, upon the whole, Far more than of her flax; and yet the reel Is full, and artfully her fingers feel With quick adjustment, provident control, The lines—too subtly twisted to unroll— Out to a perfect thread. I hence appeal To the dear Christian Church—that we may do Our Father's business in these temples mirk, Thus swift and steadfast, thus intent and strong; While thus, apart from toil, our souls pursue Some high calm spheric tune, and prove our work The better for the sweetness of our song. PAIN IN PLEASURE. A Thought lay like a flower upon mine heart, And drew around it other thoughts like bees For multitude and thirst of sweetnesses; Whereat rejoicing, I desired the art Of the Greek whistler, who to wharf and mart Could lure those insect swarms from orange-trees, That I might hive with me such thoughts and please My soul so, always. Foolish counterpart Of a weak man's vain wishes! While I spoke, The thought I called a flower grew nettlerough, The thoughts, called bees, stung me to festering: Oh, entertain (cried Reason as she woke) Your best and gladdest thoughts but long enough, And they will all prove sad enough to sting! AN APPREHENSION. If all the gentlest-hearted friends I know Concentred in one heart their gentleness, That still grew gentler till its pulse was less For life than pity,—I should yet be slow To bring my own heart nakedly below The palm of such a friend, that he should press Motive, condition, means, appliances, My false ideal joy and fickle woe, Out full to light and knowledge; I should fear Some plait between the brows, some rougher chime In the free voice. O angels, let your flood Of bitter scorn dash on me! do ye hear What I say who bear calmly all the time This everlasting face to face with God? DISCONTENT. Light human nature is too lightly tost And ruffled without cause, complaining on— Restless with rest, until, being overthrown, It learneth to lie quiet. Let a frost Or a small wasp have crept to the innermost Of our ripe peach, or let the wilful sun Shine westward of our window,—straight we run A furlong's sigh as if the world were lost. But what time through the heart and through the brain God hath transfixed us,—we, so moved before, Attain to a calm. Ay, shouldering weights of pain, We anchor in deep waters, safe from shore, And hear submissive o'er the stormy main God's chartered judgments walk for evermore. PATIENCE TAUGHT BY NATURE. “O dreary life,” we cry, “O dreary life!” And still the generations of the birds Sing through our sighing, and the flocks and herds Serenely live while we are keeping strife With Heaven's true purpose in us, as a knife Against which we may struggle! Ocean girds Unslackened the dry land, savannah-swards Unweary sweep, hills watch unworn, and rife Meek leaves drop yearly from the forest-trees To show, above, the unwasted stars that pass In their old glory: O thou God of old, Grant me some smaller grace than comes to these!— But so much patience as a blade of grass Grows by, contented through the heat and cold. CHEERFULNESS TAUGHT BY REASON. I think we are too ready with complaint In this fair world of God's. Had we no hope Indeed beyond the zenith and the slope Of yon grey blank of sky, we might grow faint To muse upon eternity's constraint Round our aspirant souls; but since the scope Must widen early, is it well to droop, For a few days consumed in loss and taint? O pusillanimous Heart, be comforted And, like a cheerful traveller, take the road, Singing beside the hedge. What if the bread Be bitter in thine inn, and thou unshod To meet the flints? At least it may be said “Because the way is short, I thank thee, God.” EXAGGERATION. We overstate the ills of life, and take Imagination (given us to bring down The choirs of singing angels overshone By God's clear glory) down our earth to rake The dismal snows instead, flake following flake, To cover all the corn; we walk upon The shadow of hills across a level thrown, And pant like climbers: near the alder brake We sigh so loud, the nightingale within Refuses to sing loud, as else she would. O brothers, let us leave the shame and sin Of taking vainly, in a plaintive mood, The holy name of Grief!—holy herein, That by the grief of One came all our good. ADEQUACY. Now, by the verdure on thy thousand hills, Belovèd England, doth the earth appear Quite good enough for men to overbear The will of God in, with rebellious wills! We cannot say the morning-sun fulfils Ingloriously its course, nor that the clear Strong stars without significance insphere Our habitation: we, meantime, our ills Heap up against this good and lift a cry Against this work-day world, this ill-spread feast, As if ourselves were better certainly Than what we come to. Maker and High Priest, I ask thee not my joys to multiply,— Only to make me worthier of the least. TO GEORGE SAND. A DESIRE. Thou large-brained woman and large-hearted man, Self-called George Sand! whose soul, amid the lions Of thy tumultuous senses, moans defiance And answers roar for roar, as spirits can: I would some mild miraculous thunder ran Above the applauded circus, in appliance Of thine own nobler nature's strength and science, Drawing two pinions, white as wings of swan, From thy strong shoulders, to amaze the place With holier light! that thou to woman's claim And man's, mightst join beside the angel's grace Of a pure genius sanctified from blame, Till child and maiden pressed to thine embrace To kiss upon thy lips a stainless fame. TO GEORGE SAND. A RECOGNITION. True genius, but true woman! dost deny The woman's nature with a manly scorn, And break away the gauds and armlets worn By weaker women in captivity? Ah, vain denial! that revolted cry Is sobbed in by a woman's voice forlorn,— Thy woman's hair, my sister, all unshorn Floats back dishevelled strength in agony, Disproving thy man's name: and while before The world thou burnest in a poet-fire, We see thy woman-heart beat evermore Through the large flame. Beat purer, heart, and higher, Till God unsex thee on the heavenly shore Where unincarnate spirits purely aspire! THE PRISONER. I count the dismal time by months and years Since last I felt the green sward under foot, And the great breath of all things summer-mute Met mine upon my lips. Now earth appears As strange to me as dreams of distant spheres Or thoughts of Heaven we weep at. Nature's lute Sounds on, behind this door so closely shut, A strange wild music to the prisoner's ears, Dilated by the distance, till the brain Grows dim with fancies which it feels too fine: While ever, with a visionary pain, Past the precluded senses, sweep and shine Streams, forests, glades, and many a golden train Of sunlit hills transfigured to Divine. INSUFFICIENCY. When I attain to utter forth in verse Some inward thought, my soul throbs audibly Along my pulses, yearning to be free And something farther, fuller, higher, rehearse, To the individual, true, and the universe, In consummation of right harmony: But, like a wind-exposed distorted tree, We are blown against for ever by the curse Which breathes through Nature. Oh, the world is weak! The effluence of each is false to all, And what we best conceive we fail to speak. Wait, soul, until thine ashen garments fall, And then resume thy broken strains, and seek Fit peroration without let or thrall. THE ROMAUNT OF THE PAGE. I. A knight of gallant deeds And a young page at his side, From the holy war in Palestine Did slow and thoughtful ride, As each were a palmer and told for beads The dews of the eventide. II. “O young page,” said the knight, “A noble page art thou! Thou fearest not to steep in blood The curls upon thy brow; And once in the tent, and twice in the fight, Didst ward me a mortal blow.” III. “O brave knight,” said the page, “Or ere we hither came, We talked in tent, we talked in field, Of the bloody battle-game; But here, below this greenwood bough, I cannot speak the same. IV. “Our troop is far behind, The woodland calm is new; Our steeds, with slow grass-muffled hoofs Tread deep the shadows through; And, in my mind, some blessing kind Is dropping with the dew. V. “The woodland calm is pure— I cannot choose but have A thought from these, o' the beechen-trees, Which in our England wave, And of the little finches fine Which sang there while in Palestine The warrior-hilt we drave. VI. “Methinks, a moment gone, I heard my mother pray! I heard, sir knight, the prayer for me Wherein she passed away; And I know the heavens are leaning down To hear what I shall say.” VII. The page spake calm and high, As of no mean degree; Perhaps he felt in nature's broad Full heart, his own was free: And the knight looked up to his lifted eye, Then answered smilingly— VIII. “Sir page, I pray your grace! Certes, I meant not so To cross your pastoral mood, sir page, With the crook of the battle-bow; But a knight may speak of a lady's face, I ween, in any mood or place, If the grasses die or grow. IX. And this I meant to say— My lady's face shall shine As ladies' faces use, to greet My page from Palestine; Or, speak she fair or prank she gay, She is no lady of mine. X. “And this I meant to fear— Her bower may suit thee ill; For, sooth, in that same field and tent, Thy talk was somewhat still: And fitter thy hand for my knightly spear Than thy tongue for my lady's will!” XI. Slowly and thankfully The young page bowed his head; His large eyes seemed to muse a smile, Until he blushed instead, And no lady in her bower, pardiè, Could blush more sudden red: “Sir Knight,—thy lady's bower to me Is suited well,” he said. XII. Beati, beati, mortui! From the convent on the sea, One mile off, or scarce so nigh, Swells the dirge as clear and high As if that, over brake and lea, Bodily the wind did carry The great altar of Saint Mary, And the fifty tapers burning o'er it, And the Lady Abbess dead before it, And the chanting nuns whom yesterweek Her voice did charge and bless,— Chanting steady, chanting meek, Chanting with a solemn breath, Because that they are thinking less Upon the dead than upon death. Beati, beati, mortui! Now the vision in the sound Wheeleth on the wind around; Now it sweepeth back, away— The uplands will not let it stay To dark the western sun: Mortui!—away at last,— Or ere the page's blush is past! And the knight heard all, and the page heard none. XIII. “A boon, thou noble knight, If ever I servèd thee! Though thou art a knight and I am a page, Now grant a boon to me; And tell me sooth, if dark or bright, If little loved or loved aright Be the face of thy ladye.” XIV. Gloomily looked the knight— “As a son thou hast servèd me, And would to none I had granted boon Except to only thee! For haply then I should love aright, For then I should know if dark or bright Were the face of my ladye. XV. “Yet it ill suits my knightly tongue To grudge that granted boon, That heavy price from heart and life I paid in silence down; The hand that claimed it, cleared in fine My father's fame: I swear by mine, That price was nobly won! XVI. “Earl Walter was a brave old earl, He was my father's friend; And while I rode the lists at court And little guessed the end, My noble father in his shroud Against a slanderer lying loud, He rose up to defend. XVII. “Oh, calm below the marble grey My father's dust was strown! Oh, meek above the marble grey His image prayed alone! The slanderer lied: the wretch was brave— For, looking up the minster-nave, He saw my father's knightly glaive Was changed from steel to stone. XVIII. “Earl Walter's glaive was steel, With a brave old hand to wear it, And dashed the lie back in the mouth Which lied against the godly truth And against the knightly merit: The slanderer, 'neath the avenger's heel, Struck up the dagger in appeal From stealthy lie to brutal force— And out upon the traitor's corse Was yielded the true spirit. XIX. “I would mine hand had fought that fight And justified my father! I would mine heart had caught that wound And slept beside him rather! I think it were a better thing Than murdered friend and marriage-ring Forced on my life together. XX. “Wail shook Earl Walter's house; His true wife shed no tear; She lay upon her bed as mute As the earl did on his bier: Till—‘Ride, ride fast,’ she said at last, ‘And bring the avengèd's son anear! Ride fast, ride free, as a dart can flee, For white of blee with waiting for me Is the corse in the next chambère.’ XXI. “I came, I knelt beside her bed; Her calm was worse than strife: ‘My husband, for thy father dear, Gave freely when thou wast not here His own and eke my life. A boon! Of that sweet child we make An orphan for thy father's sake, Make thou, for ours, a wife.’ XXII. “I said, ‘My steed neighs in the court, My bark rocks on the brine, And the warrior's vow I am under now To free the pilgrim's shrine; But fetch the ring and fetch the priest And call that daughter of thine, And rule she wide from my castle on Nyde While I am in Palestine.’ XXIII. “In the dark chambère, if the bride was fair, Ye wis, I could not see, But the steed thrice neighed, and the priest fast prayed, And wedded fast were we. Her mother smiled upon her bed As at its side we knelt to wed, And the bride rose from her knee And kissed the smile of her mother dead, Or ever she kissed me. XXIV. “My page, my page, what grieves thee so, That the tears run down thy face?”— “Alas, alas! mine own sistèr Was in thy lady's case: But she laid down the silks she wore And followed him she wed before, Disguised as his true servitor, To the very battle-place.” XXV. And wept the page, but laughed the knight, A careless laugh laughed he: “Well done it were for thy sistèr, But not for my ladye! My love, so please you, shall requite No woman, whether dark or bright, Unwomaned if she be.” XXVI. The page stopped weeping and smiled cold— “Your wisdom may declare That womanhood is proved the best By golden brooch and glossy vest The mincing ladies wear; Yet is it proved, and was of old, Anear as well, I dare to hold, By truth, or by despair.” XXVII. He smiled no more, he wept no more, But passionate he spake— “Oh, womanly she prayed in tent, When none beside did wake! Oh, womanly she paled in fight, For one belovèd's sake!— And her little hand, defiled with blood, Her tender tears of womanhood Most woman-pure did make!” XXVIII. —“Well done it were for thy sistèr, Thou tellest well her tale! But for my lady, she shall pray I' the kirk of Nydesdale. Not dread for me but love for me Shall make my lady pale; No casque shall hide her woman's tear— It shall have room to trickle clear Behind her woman's veil.” XXIX. —“But what if she mistook thy mind And followed thee to strife, Then kneeling did entreat thy love As Paynims ask for life?” —“I would forgive, and evermore Would love her as my servitor, But little as my wife. XXX. “Look up—there is a small bright cloud Alone amid the skies! So high, so pure, and so apart, A woman's honour lies.” The page looked up—the cloud was sheen— A sadder cloud did rush, I ween, Betwixt it and his eyes. XXXI. Then dimly dropped his eyes away From welkin unto hill— Ha! who rides there?—the page is 'ware, Though the cry at his heart is still: And the page seeth all and the knight seeth none, Though banner and spear do fleck the sun, And the Saracens ride at will. XXXII. He speaketh calm, he speaketh low,— “Ride fast, my master, ride, Or ere within the broadening dark The narrow shadows hide.” “Yea, fast, my page, I will do so, And keep thou at my side.” XXXIII. “Now nay, now nay, ride on thy way, Thy faithful page precede. For I must loose on saddle-bow My battle-casque that galls, I trow, The shoulder of my steed; And I must pray, as I did vow, For one in bitter need. XXXIV. “Ere night I shall be near to thee,— Now ride, my master, ride! Ere night, as parted spirits cleave To mortals too beloved to leave, I shall be at thy side.” The knight smiled free at the fantasy, And adown the dell did ride. XXXV. Had the knight looked up to the page's face, No smile the word had won; Had the knight looked up to the page's face, I ween he had never gone: Had the knight looked back to the page's geste, I ween he had turned anon, For dread was the woe in the face so young, And wild was the silent geste that flung Casque, sword to earth, as the boy down-sprung And stood—alone, alone. XXXVI. He clenched his hands as if to hold His soul's great agony— “Have I renounced my womanhood, For wifehood unto thee, And is this the last, last look of thine That ever I shall see? XXXVII. “Yet God thee save, and mayst thou have A lady to thy mind, More woman-proud and half as true As one thou leav'st behind! And God me take with Him to dwell— For Him I cannot love too well, As I have loved my kind.” XXXVIII. She looketh up, in earth's despair, The hopeful heavens to seek; That little cloud still floateth there, Whereof her loved did speak: How bright the little cloud appears! Her eyelids fall upon the tears, And the tears down either cheek. XXXIX. The tramp of hoof, the flash of steel— The Paynims round her coming! The sound and sight have made her calm,— False page, but truthful woman; She stands amid them all unmoved: A heart once broken by the loved Is strong to meet the foeman. XL. “Ho, Christian page! art keeping sheep, From pouring wine-cups resting?”— “I keep my master's noble name, For warring, not for feasting; And if that here Sir Hubert were, My master brave, my master dear, Ye would not stay the questing.” XLI. “Where is thy master, scornful page, That we may slay or bind him?”— “Now search the lea and search the wood, And see if ye can find him! Nathless, as hath been often tried, Your Paynim heroes faster ride Before him than behind him.” XLII. “Give smoother answers, lying page, Or perish in the lying!”— “I trow that if the warrior brand Beside my foot, were in my hand, 'Twere better at replying!” They cursed her deep, they smote her low, They cleft her golden ringlets through; The Loving is the Dying. XLIII. She felt the scimitar gleam down, And met it from beneath With smile more bright in victory Than any sword from sheath,— Which flashed across her lip serene, Most like the spirit-light between The darks of life and death. XLIV. Ingemisco, ingemisco! From the convent on the sea, Now it sweepeth solemnly, As over wood and over lea Bodily the wind did carry The great altar of St. Mary, And the fifty tapers paling o'er it, And the Lady Abbess stark before it, And the weary nuns with hearts that faintly Beat along their voices saintly— Ingemisco, ingemisco! Dirge for abbess laid in shroud Sweepeth o'er the shroudless dead, Page or lady, as we said, With the dews upon her head, All as sad if not as loud. Ingemisco, ingemisco! Is ever a lament begun By any mourner under sun, Which, ere it endeth, suits but one? THE LAY OF THE BROWN ROSARY. FIRST PART. I “Onora, Onora,”—her mother is calling, She sits at the lattice and hears the dew falling Drop after drop from the sycamores laden With dew as with blossom, and calls home the maiden, “Night cometh, Onora.” II She looks down the garden-walk caverned with trees, To the limes at the end where the green arbour is— “Some sweet thought or other may keep where it found her, While, forgot or unseen in the dreamlight around her, Night cometh—Onora!” III She looks up the forest whose alleys shoot on Like the mute minster-aisles when the anthem is done, And the choristers sitting with faces aslant Feel the silence to consecrate more than the chant— “Onora, Onora!” IV And forward she looketh across the brown heath— “Onora, art coming?”—what is it she seeth? Nought, nought but the grey border-stone that is wist To dilate and assume a wild shape in the mist— “My daughter!” Then over V The casement she leaneth, and as she doth so She is 'ware of her little son playing below: “Now where is Onora?” He hung down his head And spake not, then answering blushed scarlet-red,— “At the tryst with her lover.” VI But his mother was wroth: in a sternness quoth she, “As thou play'st at the ball art thou playing with me? When we know that her lover to battle is gone, And the saints know above that she loveth but one And will ne'er wed another?” VII Then the boy wept aloud; 'twas a fair sight yet sad To see the tears run down the sweet blooms he had: He stamped with his foot, said—“The saints know I lied Because truth that is wicked is fittest to hide: Must I utter it, mother?” VIII In his vehement childhood he hurried within And knelt at her feet as in prayer against sin, But a child at a prayer never sobbeth as he— “Oh! she sits with the nun of the brown rosary, At nights in the ruin— IX “The old convent ruin the ivy rots off, Where the owl hoots by day and the toad is sun-proof, Where no singing-birds build and the trees gaunt and grey As in stormy sea-coasts appear blasted one way— But is this the wind's doing? X “A nun in the east wall was buried alive Who mocked at the priest when he called her to shrive, And shrieked such a curse, as the stone took her breath, The old abbess fell backwards and swooned unto death With an Ave half-spoken. XI “I tried once to pass it, myself and my hound, Till, as fearing the lash, down he shivered to ground— A brave hound, my mother! a brave hound, ye wot! And the wolf thought the same with his fangs at her throat In the pass of the Brocken. XII “At dawn and at eve, mother, who sitteth there With the brown rosary never used for a prayer? Stoop low, mother, low! If we went there to see, What an ugly great hole in that east wall must be At dawn and at even! XIII “Who meet there, my mother, at dawn and at even? Who meet by that wall, never looking to heaven? O sweetest my sister, what doeth with thee The ghost of a nun with a brown rosary And a face turned from heaven? XIV “Saint Agnes o'erwatcheth my dreams and erewhile I have felt through mine eyelids the warmth of her smile; But last night, as a sadness like pity came o'er her, She whispered—‘Say two prayers at dawn for Onora: The Tempted is sinning.’” XV “Onora, Onora!” they heard her not coming, Not a step on the grass, not a voice through the gloaming; But her mother looked up, and she stood on the floor Fair and still as the moonlight that came there before, And a smile just beginning: XVI It touches her lips but it dares not arise To the height of the mystical sphere of her eyes, And the large musing eyes, neither joyous nor sorry, Sing on like the angels in separate glory Between clouds of amber; XVII For the hair droops in clouds amber-coloured till stirred Into gold by the gesture that comes with a word; While—O soft!—her speaking is so interwound Of the dim and the sweet, 'tis a twilight of sound And floats through the chamber. XVIII ‘Since thou shrivest my brother, fair mother,” said she, “I count on thy priesthood for marrying of me; And I know by the hills that the battle is done, That my lover rides on, will be here with the sun, 'Neath the eyes that behold thee.” XIX Her mother sat silent—too tender, I wis, Of the smile her dead father smiled dying to kiss: But the boy started up pale with tears, passion-wrought— “O wicked fair sister, the hills utter nought! If he cometh, who told thee?” XX “I know by the hills,” she resumed calm and clear, “By the beauty upon them, that he is anear: Did they ever look so since he bade me adieu? Oh, love in the waking, sweet brother, is true, As Saint Agnes in sleeping!” XXI Half-ashamed and half-softened the boy did not speak, And the blush met the lashes which fell on his cheek: She bowed down to kiss him: dear saints, did he see Or feel on her bosom the brown rosary, That he shrank away weeping? SECOND PART. A bed. Onora, sleeping. Angels, but not near. First Angel. Must we stand so far, and she So very fair? Second Angel. As bodies be. First Angel. And she so mild? Second Angel. As spirits when They meeken, not to God, but men. First Angel. And she so young, that I who bring Good dreams for saintly children, might Mistake that small soft face tonight, And fetch her such a blessèd thing That at her waking she would weep For childhood lost anew in sleep. How hath she sinned? Second Angel. In bartering love; God's love for man's. First Angel. We may reprove The world for this, not only her: Let me approach to breathe away This dust o' the heart with holy air. Second Angel. Stand off! She sleeps, and did not pray. First Angel. Did none pray for her? Second Angel. Ay, a child,— Who never, praying, wept before: While, in a mother undefiled, Prayer goeth on in sleep, as true And pauseless as the pulses do. First Angel. Then I approach. Second Angel. It is not willed. First Angel. One word: is she redeemed? Second Angel. No more! The place is filled. [Angels vanish. Evil Spirit (in a Nun's garb by the bed). Forbear that dream—forbear that dream! too near to heaven it leaned. Onora (in sleep). Nay, leave me this—but only this! 'tis but a dream, sweet fiend! Evil Spirit. It is a thought. Onora (in sleep). A sleeping thought—most innocent of good: It doth the Devil no harm, sweet fiend! it cannot if it would. I say in it no holy hymn, I do no holy work, I scarcely hear the sabbath-bell that chimeth from the kirk. Evil Spirit. Forbear that dream—forbear that dream! Onora (in sleep). Nay, let me dream at least. That far-off bell, it may be took for viol at a feast: I only walk among the fields, beneath the autumn-sun, With my dead father, hand in hand, as I have often done. Evil Spirit. Forbear that dream—forbear that dream! Onora (in sleep). Nay, sweet fiend, let me go: I never more can walk with him, oh, never more but so! For they have tied my father's feet beneath the kirkyard stone, Oh, deep and straight! oh, very straight! they move at nights alone: And then he calleth through my dreams, he calleth tenderly, “Come forth, my daughter, my beloved, and walk the fields with me!” Evil Spirit. Forbear that dream, or else disprove its pureness by a sign. Onora (in sleep). Speak on, thou shalt be satisfied, my word shall answer thine. I heard a bird which used to sing when I a child was praying, I see the poppies in the corn I used to sport away in: What shall I do—tread down the dew and pull the blossoms blowing? Or clap my wicked hands to fright the finches from the rowan? Evil Spirit. Thou shalt do something harder still. Stand up where thou dost stand Among the fields of Dreamland with thy father hand in hand, And clear and slow repeat the vow, declare its cause and kind, Which not to break, in sleep or wake thou bearest on thy mind. Onora (in sleep). I bear a vow of sinful kind, a vow for mournful cause; I vowed it deep, I vowed it strong, the spirits laughed applause: The spirits trailed along the pines low laughter like a breeze, While, high atween their swinging tops, the stars appeared to freeze. Evil Spirit. More calm and free, speak out to me why such a vow was made. Onora (in sleep). Because that God decreed my death and I shrank back afraid. Have patience, O dead father mine! I did not fear to die— I wish I were a young dead child and had thy company! I wish I lay beside thy feet, a buried three-year child, And wearing only a kiss of thine upon my lips that smiled! The linden-tree that covers thee might so have shadowed twain, For death itself I did not fear—'tis love that makes the pain: Love feareth death. I was no child, I was betrothed that day; I wore a troth-kiss on my lips I could not give away. How could I bear to lie content and still beneath a stone, And feel mine own betrothed go by—alas! no more mine own— Go leading by in wedding pomp some lovely lady brave, With cheeks that blushed as red as rose, while mine were white in grave? How could I bear to sit in heaven, on e'er so high a throne, And hear him say to her—to her! that else he loveth none? Though e'er so high I sate above, though e'er so low he spake, As clear as thunder I should hear the new oath he might take, That hers, forsooth, were heavenly eyes—ah me, while very dim Some heavenly eyes (indeed of heaven!) would darken down to him! Evil Spirit. Who told thee thou wast called to death? Onora (in sleep). I sate all night beside thee: The grey owl on the ruined wall shut both his eyes to hide thee, And ever he flapped his heavy wing all brokenly and weak, And the long grass waved against the sky, around his gasping beak. I sate beside thee all the night, while the moonlight lay forlorn Strewn round us like a dead world's shroud in ghastly fragments torn: And through the night, and through the hush, and over the flapping wing, We heard beside the Heavenly Gate the angels murmuring: We heard them say, “Put day to day, and count the days to seven, “And God will draw Onora up the golden stairs of heaven. “And yet the Evil ones have leave that purpose to defer, “For if she has no need of Him, He has no need of her.” Evil Spirit. Speak out to me, speak bold and free. Onora (in sleep). And then I heard thee say— “I count upon my rosary brown the hours thou hast to stay! “Yet God permits us Evil ones to put by that decree, “Since if thou hast no need of Him, He has no need of thee: “And if thou wilt forgo the sight of angels, verily “Thy true love gazing on thy face shall guess what angels be; “Nor bride shall pass, save thee” . . . Alas!—my father's hand's a-cold, The meadows seem . . . Evil Spirit. Forbear the dream, or let the vow be told. Onora (in sleep). I vowed upon thy rosary brown, this string of antique beads, By charnel lichens overgrown, and dank among the weeds, This rosary brown which is thine own,—lost soul of buried nun! Who, lost by vow, wouldst render now all souls alike undone,— I vowed upon thy rosary brown,—and, till such vow should break, A pledge always of living days 'twas hung around my neck— I vowed to thee on rosary (dead father, look not so!), I would not thank God in my weal, nor seek God in my woe. Evil Spirit. And canst thou prove . . . Onora (in sleep). O love, my love! I felt him near again! I saw his steed on mountain-head, I heard it on the plain! Was this no weal for me to feel? Is greater weal than this? Yet when he came, I wept his name—and the angels heard but his. Evil Spirit. Well done, well done! Onora (in sleep). Ah me, the sun! the dreamlight 'gins to pine,— Ah me, how dread can look the Dead! Aroint thee, father mine! She starteth from slumber, she sitteth upright, And her breath comes in sobs, while she stares through the night; There is nought; the great willow, her lattice before, Large-drawn in the moon, lieth calm on the floor: But her hands tremble fast as their pulses and, free From the death-clasp, close over—the brown rosary. THIRD PART. I 'Tis a morn for a bridal; the merry bride-bell Rings clear through the green-wood that skirts the chapelle, And the priest at the altar awaiteth the bride, And the sacristans slyly are jesting aside At the work shall be doing; II While down through the wood rides that fair company, The youths with the courtship, the maids with the glee, Till the chapel-cross opens to sight, and at once All the maids sigh demurely and think for the nonce, “And so endeth a wooing!” III And the bride and the bridegroom are leading the way, With his hand on her rein, and a word yet to say; Her dropt eyelids suggest the soft answers beneath, And the little quick smiles come and go with her breath When she sigheth or speaketh. IV And the tender bride-mother breaks off unaware From an Ave, to think that her daughter is fair, Till in nearing the chapel and glancing before, She seeth her little son stand at the door: Is it play that he seeketh? V Is it play, when his eyes wander innocent-wild And sublimed with a sadness unfitting a child? He trembles not, weeps not; the passion is done, And calmly he kneels in their midst, with the sun On his head like a glory. VI “O fair-featured maids, ye are many!” he cried, “But in fairness and vileness who matcheth the bride? O brave-hearted youths, ye are many! but whom For the courage and woe can ye match with the groom As ye see them before ye?” VII Out spake the bride's mother, “The vileness is thine If thou shame thine own sister, a bride at the shrine!” Out spake the bride's lover, “The vileness be mine If he shame mine own wife at the hearth or the shrine And the charge be unprovèd. VIII “Bring the charge, prove the charge, brother! speak it aloud: Let thy father and hers hear it deep in his shroud!” —“O father, thou seest, for dead eyes can see, How she wears on her bosom a brown rosary, O my father belovèd!” IX Then outlaughed the bridegroom, and outlaughed withal Both maidens and youths by the old chapel-wall: “So she weareth no love-gift, kind brother,” quoth he, “She may wear an she listeth a brown rosary, Like a pure-hearted lady.” X Then swept through the chapel the long bridal train; Though he spake to the bride she replied not again: On, as one in a dream, pale and stately she went Where the altar-lights burn o'er the great sacrament, Faint with daylight, but steady. XI But her brother had passed in between them and her, And calmly knelt down on the high-altar stair— Of an infantine aspect so stern to the view That the priest could not smile on the child's eyes of blue As he would for another. XII He knelt like a child marble-sculptured and white That seems kneeling to pray on the tomb of a knight, With a look taken up to each iris of stone From the greatness and death where he kneeleth, but none From the face of a mother. XIII “In your chapel, O priest, ye have wedded and shriven Fair wives for the hearth, and fair sinners for heaven; But this fairest my sister, ye think now to wed, Bid her kneel where she standeth, and shrive her instead: O shrive her and wed not!” XIV In tears, the bride's mother,—“Sir priest, unto thee Would he lie, as he lied to this fair company.” In wrath, the bride's lover,—“The lie shall be clear! Speak it out, boy! the saints in their niches shall hear: Be the charge proved or said not!” XV Then serene in his childhood he lifted his face, And his voice sounded holy and fit for the place,— “Look down from your niches, ye still saints, and see How she wears on her bosom a brown rosary! Is it used for the praying?” XVI The youths looked aside—to laugh there were a sin— And the maidens' lips trembled from smiles shut within. Quoth the priest, “Thou art wild, pretty boy! Blessed she Who prefers at her bridal a brown rosary To a worldly arraying.” XVII The bridegroom spake low and led onward the bride And before the high altar they stood side by side: The rite-book is opened, the rite is begun, They have knelt down together to rise up as one. Who laughed by the altar? XVIII The maidens looked forward, the youths looked around, The bridegroom's eye flashed from his prayer at the sound; And each saw the bride, as if no bride she were, Gazing cold at the priest without gesture of prayer, As he read from the psalter. XIX The priest never knew that she did so, but still He felt a power on him too strong for his will: And whenever the Great Name was there to be read, His voice sank to silence—that could not be said, Or the air could not hold it. XX “I have sinnèd,” quoth he, “I have sinnèd, I wot”— And the tears ran adown his old cheeks at the thought: They dropped fast on the book, but he read on the same, And aye was the silence where should be the Name,— As the choristers told it. XXI The rite-book is closed, and the rite being done They, who knelt down together, arise up as one: Fair riseth the bride—Oh, a fair bride is she, But, for all (think the maidens) that brown rosary, No saint at her praying! XXII What aileth the bridegroom? He glares blank and wide; Then suddenly turning he kisseth the bride; His lips stung her with cold; she glanced upwardly mute: “Mine own wife,” he said, and fell stark at her foot In the word he was saying. XXIII They have lifted him up, but his head sinks away, And his face showeth bleak in the sunshine and grey. Leave him now where he lieth—for oh, never more Will he kneel at an altar or stand on a floor! Let his bride gaze upon him. XXIV Long and still was her gaze while they chafèd him there And breathed in the mouth whose last life had kissed her, But when they stood up—only they! with a start The shriek from her soul struck her pale lips apart: She has lived, and forgone him! XXV And low on his body she droppeth adown— “Didst call me thine own wife, belovèd—thine own? Then take thine own with thee! thy coldness is warm To the world's cold without thee! Come, keep me from harm In a calm of thy teaching!” XXVI She looked in his face earnest-long, as in sooth There were hope of an answer, and then kissed his mouth, And with head on his bosom, wept, wept bitterly,— “Now, O God, take pity—take pity on me! God, hear my beseeching!” XXVII She was 'ware of a shadow that crossed where she lay, She was 'ware of a presence that withered the day: Wild she sprang to her feet,—“I surrender to thee The broken vow's pledge, the accursed rosary,— I am ready for dying!” XXVIII She dashed it in scorn to the marble-paved ground Where it fell mute as snow, and a weird music-sound Crept up, like a chill, up the aisles long and dim,— As the fiends tried to mock at the choristers' hymn And moaned in the trying. FOURTH PART. Onora looketh listlessly adown the garden walk: “I am weary, O my mother, of thy tender talk. I am weary of the trees a-waving to and fro, Of the steadfast skies above, the running brooks below. All things are the same, but I,—only I am dreary, And, mother, of my dreariness behold me very weary. “Mother, brother, pull the flowers I planted in the spring And smiled to think I should smile more upon their gathering: The bees will find out other flowers—oh, pull them, dearest mine, And carry them and carry me before Saint Agnes' shrine.” —Whereat they pulled the summer flowers she planted in the spring, And her and them all mournfully to Agnes' shrine did bring. She looked up to the pictured saint and gently shook her head— “The picture is too calm for me—too calm for me,” she said: “The little flowers we brought with us, before it we may lay, For those are used to look at heaven,—but I must turn away, Because no sinner under sun can dare or bear to gaze On God's or angel's holiness, except in Jesu's face.” She spoke with passion after pause—“And were it wisely done If we who cannot gaze above, should walk the earth alone? If we whose virtue is so weak should have a will so strong, And stand blind on the rocks to choose the right path from the wrong? To choose perhaps a love-lit hearth, instead of love and heaven,— A single rose, for a rose-tree which beareth seven times seven? A rose that droppeth from the hand, that fadeth in the breast,— Until, in grieving for the worst, we learn what is the best!” Then breaking into tears,—“Dear God,” she cried, “and must we see All blissful things depart from us or ere we go to Thee? We cannot guess Thee in the wood or hear Thee in the wind? Our cedars must fall round us ere we see the light behind? Ay sooth, we feel too strong, in weal, to need thee on that road, But woe being come, the soul is dumb that crieth not on ‘God.’” Her mother could not speak for tears; she ever musèd thus, “The bees will find out other flowers,—but what is left for us?” But her young brother stayed his sobs and knelt beside her knee, —“Thou sweetest sister in the world, hast never a word for me?” She passed her hand across his face, she pressed it on his cheek, So tenderly, so tenderly—she needed not to speak. The wreath which lay on shrine that day, at vespers bloomed no more. The woman fair who placed it there had died an hour before. Both perished mute for lack of root, earth's nourishment to reach. O reader, breathe (the ballad saith) some sweetness out of each! THE MOURNING MOTHER (OF THE DEAD BLIND). I. Dost thou weep, mourning mother, For thy blind boy in grave? That no more with each other Sweet counsel ye can have? That he, left dark by nature, Can never more be led By thee, maternal creature, Along smooth paths instead? That thou canst no more show him The sunshine, by the heat; The river's silver flowing, By murmurs at his feet? The foliage, by its coolness; The roses, by their smell; And all creation's fulness, By Love's invisible? Weepest thou to behold not His meek blind eyes again,— Closed doorways which were folded, And prayed against in vain— And under which, sat smiling The child-mouth evermore, As one who watcheth, wiling The time by, at a door? And weepest thou to feel not His clinging hand on thine— Which now, at dream-time, will not Its cold touch disentwine? And weepest thou still ofter, Oh, never more to mark His low soft words, made softer By speaking in the dark? Weep on, thou mourning mother! II. But since to him when living, Thou wast both sun and moon, Look o'er his grave, surviving, From a high sphere alone: Sustain that exaltation, Expand that tender light, And hold in mother-passion Thy Blessèd in thy sight. See how he went out straightway From the dark world he knew,— No twilight in the gateway To mediate 'twixt the two,— Into the sudden glory, Out of the dark he trod, Departing from before thee At once to light and God!— For the first face, beholding The Christ's in its divine, For the first place, the golden And tideless hyaline, With trees at lasting summer That rock to songful sound, While angels the new-comer Wrap a still smile around. Oh, in the blessèd psalm now, His happy voice he tries, Spreading a thicker palm-bough, Than others, o'er his eyes! Yet still, in all the singing, Thinks haply of thy song Which, in his life's first springing, Sang to him all night long; And wishes it beside him, With kissing lips that cool And soft did overglide him, To make the sweetness full. Look up, O mourning mother! Thy blind boy walks in light: Ye wait for one another Before God's infinite. But thou art now the darkest, Thou mother left below— Thou, the sole blind,—thou markest, Content that it be so,— Until ye two have meeting Where Heaven's pearl-gate is, And he shall lead thy feet in, As once thou leddest his. Wait on, thou mourning mother! A VALEDICTION. I God be with thee, my belovèd,—God be with thee! Else alone thou goest forth, Thy face unto the north, Moor and pleasance all around thee and beneath thee Looking equal in one snow; While I, who try to reach thee, Vainly follow, vainly follow With the farewell and the hollo, And cannot reach thee so. Alas, I can but teach thee! God be with thee, my belovèd,—God be with thee! II Can I teach thee, my belovèd,—can I teach thee? If I said, “Go left or right,” The counsel would be light, The wisdom, poor of all that could enrich thee; My right would show like left; My raising would depress thee, My choice of light would blind thee, Of way—would leave behind thee, Of end—would leave bereft. Alas, I can but bless thee! May God teach thee, my belovèd,—may God teach thee! III Can I bless thee, my belovèd,—can I bless thee? What blessing word can I From mine own tears keep dry? What flowers grow in my field wherewith to dress thee? My good reverts to ill; My calmnesses would move thee, My softnesses would prick thee, My bindings up would break thee, My crownings curse and kill. Alas, I can but love thee! May God bless thee, my belovèd,—may God bless thee! IV Can I love thee, my belovèd,—can I love thee? And is this like love, to stand With no help in my hand, When strong as death I fain would watch above thee? My love-kiss can deny No tear that falls beneath it; Mine oath of love can swear thee From no ill that comes near thee, And thou diest while I breathe it, And I—I can but die! May God love thee, my belovèd,—may God love thee! LADY GERALDINE'S COURTSHIP: A ROMANCE OF THE AGE. A Poet writes to his Friend. Place—A Room in Wycombe Hall. Time—Late in the evening. I Dear my friend and fellow-student, I would lean my spirit o'er you! Down the purple of this chamber tears should scarcely run at will. I am humbled who was humble. Friend, I bow my head before you: You should lead me to my peasants, but their faces are too still. II There's a lady, an earl's daughter,—she is proud and she is noble, And she treads the crimson carpet and she breathes the perfumed air, And a kingly blood sends glances up, her princely eye to trouble, And the shadow of a monarch's crown is softened in her hair. III She has halls among the woodlands, she has castles by the breakers, She has farms and she has manors, she can threaten and command: And the palpitating engines snort in steam across her acres, As they mark upon the blasted heaven the measure of the land. IV There are none of England's daughters who can show a prouder presence; Upon princely suitors' praying she has looked in her disdain. She was sprung of English nobles, I was born of English peasants; What was I that I should love her, save for competence to pain? V I was only a poor poet, made for singing at her casement, As the finches or the thrushes, while she thought of other things. Oh, she walked so high above me, she appeared to my abasement, In her lovely silken murmur, like an angel clad in wings! VI Many vassals bow before her as her carriage sweeps their doorways; She has blest their little children, as a priest or queen were she: Far too tender, or too cruel far, her smile upon the poor was, For I thought it was the same smile which she used to smile on me. VII She has voters in the Commons, she has lovers in the palace, And, of all the fair court-ladies, few have jewels half as fine; Oft the Prince has named her beauty 'twixt the red wine and the chalice: Oh, and what was I to love her? my beloved, my Geraldine! VIII Yet I could not choose but love her: I was born to poet-uses, To love all things set above me, all of good and all of fair. Nymphs of mountain, not of valley, we are wont to call the Muses; And in nympholeptic climbing, poets pass from mount to star. IX And because I was a poet, and because the public praised me, With a critical deduction for the modern writer's fault, I could sit at rich men's tables,—though the courtesies that raised me, Still suggested clear between us the pale spectrum of the salt. X And they praised me in her presence—“Will your book appear this summer?” Then returning to each other—“Yes, our plans are for the moors.” Then with whisper dropped behind me—“There he is! the latest comer. Oh, she only likes his verses! what is over, she endures. XI “Quite low-born, self-educated! somewhat gifted though by nature, And we make a point of asking him,—of being very kind. You may speak, he does not hear you! and, besides, he writes no satire,— All these serpents kept by charmers leave the natural sting behind.” XII I grew scornfuller, grew colder, as I stood up there among them, Till as frost intense will burn you, the cold scorning scorched my brow; When a sudden silver speaking, gravely cadenced, over-rung them, And a sudden silken stirring touched my inner nature through. XIII I looked upward and beheld her: with a calm and regnant spirit, Slowly round she swept her eyelids, and said clear before them all— “Have you such superfluous honour, sir, that able to confer it You will come down, Mister Bertram, as my guest to Wycombe Hall?” XIV Here she paused; she had been paler at the first word of her speaking, But, because a silence followed it, blushed somewhat, as for shame: Then, as scorning her own feeling, resumed calmly—“I am seeking More distinction than these gentlemen think worthy of my claim. XV “Ne'ertheless, you see, I seek it—not because I am a woman,” (Here her smile sprang like a fountain and, so, overflowed her mouth) “But because my woods in Sussex have some purple shades at gloaming Which are worthy of a king in state, or poet in his youth. XVI “I invite you, Mister Bertram, to no scene for worldly speeches— Sir, I scarce should dare—but only where God asked the thrushes first: And if you will sing beside them, in the covert of my beeches, I will thank you for the woodlands,—for the human world, at worst.” XVII Then she smiled around right childly, then she gazed around right queenly, And I bowed—I could not answer; alternated light and gloom— While as one who quells the lions, with a steady eye serenely, She, with level fronting eyelids, passed out stately from the room. XVIII Oh, the blessèd woods of Sussex, I can hear them still around me, With their leafy tide of greenery still rippling up the wind! Oh, the cursèd woods of Sussex! where the hunter's arrow found me, When a fair face and a tender voice had made me mad and blind! XIX In that ancient hall of Wycombe thronged the numerous guests invited, And the lovely London ladies trod the floors with gliding feet; And their voices low with fashion, not with feeling, softly freighted All the air about the windows with elastic laughters sweet. XX For at eve the open windows flung their light out on the terrace Which the floating orbs of curtains did with gradual shadow sweep, While the swans upon the river, fed at morning by the heiress, Trembled downward through their snowy wings at music in their sleep. XXI And there evermore was music, both of instrument and singing, Till the finches of the shrubberies grew restless in the dark; But the cedars stood up motionless, each in a moonlight's ringing, And the deer, half in the glimmer, strewed the hollows of the park. XXII And though sometimes she would bind me with her silver-corded speeches To commix my words and laughter with the converse and the jest, Oft I sat apart and, gazing on the river through the beeches, Heard, as pure the swans swam down it, her pure voice o'erfloat the rest. XXIII In the morning, horn of huntsman, hoof of steed and laugh of rider, Spread out cheery from the courtyard till we lost them in the hills, While herself and other ladies, and her suitors left beside her, Went a-wandering up the gardens through the laurels and abeles. XXIV Thus, her foot upon the new-mown grass, bareheaded, with the flowing Of the virginal white vesture gathered closely to her throat, And the golden ringlets in her neck just quickened by her going, And appearing to breathe sun for air, and doubting if to float,— XXV With a bunch of dewy maple, which her right hand held above her, And which trembled a green shadow in betwixt her and the skies, As she turned her face in going, thus, she drew me on to love her, And to worship the divineness of the smile hid in her eyes. XXVI For her eyes alone smile constantly; her lips have serious sweetness, And her front is calm, the dimple rarely ripples on the cheek; But her deep blue eyes smile constantly, as if they in discreetness Kept the secret of a happy dream she did not care to speak. XXVII Thus she drew me the first morning, out across into the garden, And I walked among her noble friends and could not keep behind. Spake she unto all and unto me—“Behold, I am the warden Of the song-birds in these lindens, which are cages to their mind. XXVIII “But within this swarded circle into which the lime-walk brings us, Whence the beeches, rounded greenly, stand away in reverent fear, I will let no music enter, saving what the fountain sings us Which the lilies round the basin may seem pure enough to hear. XXIX “The live air that waves the lilies waves the slender jet of water Like a holy thought sent feebly up from soul of fasting saint: Whereby lies a marble Silence, sleeping (Lough the sculptor wrought her), So asleep she is forgetting to say Hush!—a fancy quaint. XXX “Mark how heavy white her eyelids! not a dream between them lingers; And the left hand's index droppeth from the lips upon the cheek: While the right hand,—with the symbol-rose held slack within the fingers,— Has fallen backward in the basin—yet this Silence will not speak! XXXI “That the essential meaning growing may exceed the special symbol, Is the thought as I conceive it: it applies more high and low. Our true noblemen will often through right nobleness grow humble, And assert an inward honour by denying outward show.” XXXII “Nay, your Silence,” said I, “truly, holds her symbol-rose but slackly, Yet she holds it, or would scarcely be a Silence to our ken: And your nobles wear their ermine on the outside, or walk blackly In the presence of the social law as mere ignoble men. XXXIII “Let the poets dream such dreaming! madam, in these British islands 'Tis the substance that wanes ever, 'tis the symbol that exceeds. Soon we shall have nought but symbol: and, for statues like this Silence, Shall accept the rose's image—in another case, the weed's.” XXXIV “Not so quickly,” she retorted,—“I confess, where'er you go, you Find for things, names—shows for actions, and pure gold for honour clear: But when all is run to symbol in the Social, I will throw you The world's book which now reads dryly, and sit down with Silence here.” XXXV Half in playfulness she spoke, I thought, and half in indignation; Friends, who listened, laughed her words off, while her lovers deemed her fair: A fair woman, flushed with feeling, in her noble-lighted station Near the statue's white reposing—and both bathed in sunny air! XXXVI With the trees round, not so distant but you heard their vernal murmur, And beheld in light and shadow the leaves in and outward move, And the little fountain leaping toward the sun-heart to be warmer, Then recoiling in a tremble from the too much light above. XXXVII 'Tis a picture for remembrance. And thus, morning after morning, Did I follow as she drew me by the spirit to her feet. Why, her greyhound followed also! dogs—we both were dogs for scorning— To be sent back when she pleased it and her path lay through the wheat. XXXVIII And thus, morning after morning, spite of vows and spite of sorrow, Did I follow at her drawing, while the weekdays passed along,— Just to feed the swans this noontide, or to see the fawns to-morrow, Or to teach the hill-side echo some sweet Tuscan in a song. XXXIX Ay, for sometimes on the hill-side, while we sate down in the gowans, With the forest green behind us and its shadow cast before, And the river running under, and across it from the rowans A brown partridge whirring near us till we felt the air it bore,— XL There, obedient to her praying, did I read aloud the poems Made to Tuscan flutes, or instruments more various of our own; Read the pastoral parts of Spenser, or the subtle interflowings Found in Petrarch's sonnets—here's the book, the leaf is folded down! XLI Or at times a modern volume, Wordsworth's solemn-thoughted idyl, Howitt's ballad-verse, or Tennyson's enchanted reverie,— Or from Browning some “Pomegranate,” which, if cut deep down the middle, Shows a heart within blood-tinctured, of a veined humanity. XLII Or at times I read there, hoarsely, some new poem of my making: Poets ever fail in reading their own verses to their worth, For the echo in you breaks upon the words which you are speaking, And the chariot wheels jar in the gate through which you drive them forth. XLIII After, when we were grown tired of books, the silence round us flinging A slow arm of sweet compression, felt with beatings at the breast, She would break out on a sudden in a gush of woodland singing, Like a child's emotion in a god—a naiad tired of rest. XLIV Oh, to see or hear her singing! scarce I know which is divinest, For her looks sing too—she modulates her gestures on the tune, And her mouth stirs with the song, like song; and when the notes are finest, 'Tis the eyes that shoot out vocal light and seem to swell them on. XLV Then we talked—oh, how we talked! her voice, so cadenced in the talking, Made another singing—of the soul! a music without bars: While the leafy sounds of woodlands, humming round where we were walking, Brought interposition worthy-sweet,—as skies about the stars. XLVI And she spake such good thoughts natural, as if she always thought them; She had sympathies so rapid, open, free as bird on branch, Just as ready to fly east as west, whichever way besought them, In the birchen-wood a chirrup, or a cock-crow in the grange. XLVII In her utmost lightness there is truth—and often she speaks lightly, Has a grace in being gay which even mournful souls approve, For the root of some grave earnest thought is understruck so rightly As to justify the foliage and the waving flowers above. XLVIII And she talked on—we talked, rather! upon all things, substance, shadow, Of the sheep that browsed the grasses, of the reapers in the corn, Of the little children from the schools, seen winding through the meadow, Of the poor rich world beyond them, still kept poorer by its scorn. XLIX So, of men, and so, of letters—books are men of higher stature, And the only men that speak aloud for future times to hear; So, of mankind in the abstract, which grows slowly into nature, Yet will lift the cry of “progress,” as it trod from sphere to sphere. L And her custom was to praise me when I said,—“The Age culls simples, With a broad clown's back turned broadly to the glory of the stars. We are gods by our own reck'ning, and may well shut up the temples, And wield on, amid the incense-steam, the thunder of our cars. LI “For we throw out acclamations of self-thanking, self-admiring, With, at every mile run faster,—‘O the wondrous wondrous age!’ Little thinking if we work our souls as nobly as our iron, Or if angels will commend us at the goal of pilgrimage. LII “Why, what is this patient entrance into nature's deep resources But the child's most gradual learning to walk upright without bane! When we drive out, from the cloud of steam, majestical white horses, Are we greater than the first men who led black ones by the mane? LIII “If we trod the deeps of ocean, if we struck the stars in rising, If we wrapped the globe intensely with one hot electric breath, 'Twere but power within our tether, no new spirit-power comprising, And in life we were not greater men, nor bolder men in death.” LIV She was patient with my talking; and I loved her, loved her certes As I loved all heavenly objects, with uplifted eyes and hands; As I loved pure inspirations, loved the graces, loved the virtues, In a Love content with writing his own name on desert sands. LV Or at least I thought so, purely; thought no idiot Hope was raising Any crown to crown Love's silence, silent Love that sate alone: Out, alas! the stag is like me, he that tries to go on grazing With the great deep gun-wound in his neck, then reels with sudden moan. LVI It was thus I reeled. I told you that her hand had many suitors; But she smiles them down imperially as Venus did the waves, And with such a gracious coldness that they cannot press their futures On the present of her courtesy, which yieldingly enslaves. LVII And this morning as I sat alone within the inner chamber With the great saloon beyond it, lost in pleasant thought serene, For I had been reading Camoëns, that poem you remember, Which his lady's eyes are praised in as the sweetest ever seen. LVIII And the book lay open, and my thought flew from it, taking from it A vibration and impulsion to an end beyond its own, As the branch of a green osier, when a child would overcome it, Springs up freely from his claspings and goes swinging in the sun. LIX As I mused I heard a murmur; it grew deep as it grew longer, Speakers using earnest language—“Lady Geraldine, you would!” And I heard a voice that pleaded, ever on in accents stronger, As a sense of reason gave it power to make its rhetoric good. LX Well I knew that voice; it was an earl's, of soul that matched his station, Soul completed into lordship, might and right read on his brow; Very finely courteous; far too proud to doubt his domination Of the common people, he atones for grandeur by a bow. LXI High straight forehead, nose of eagle, cold blue eyes of less expression Than resistance, coldly casting off the looks of other men, As steel, arrows; unelastic lips which seem to taste possession And be cautious lest the common air should injure or distrain. LXII For the rest, accomplished, upright,—ay, and standing by his order With a bearing not ungraceful; fond of art and letters too; Just a good man made a proud man,—as the sandy rocks that border A wild coast, by circumstances, in a regnant ebb and flow. LXIII Thus, I knew that voice, I heard it, and I could not help the hearkening: In the room I stood up blindly, and my burning heart within Seemed to seethe and fuse my senses till they ran on all sides darkening, And scorched, weighed like melted metal round my feet that stood therein. LXIV And that voice, I heard it pleading, for love's sake, for wealth, position, For the sake of liberal uses and great actions to be done: And she interrupted gently, “Nay, my lord, the old tradition Of your Normans, by some worthier hand than mine is, should be won.” LXV “Ah, that white hand!” he said quickly,—and in his he either drew it Or attempted—for with gravity and instance she replied, “Nay, indeed, my lord, this talk is vain, and we had best eschew it And pass on, like friends, to other points less easy to decide.” LXVI What he said again, I know not: it is likely that his trouble Worked his pride up to the surface, for she answered in slow scorn, “And your lordship judges rightly. Whom I marry shall be noble, Ay, and wealthy. I shall never blush to think how he was born.” LXVII There, I maddened! her words stung me. Life swept through me into fever, And my soul sprang up astonished, sprang full-statured in an hour. Know you what it is when anguish, with apocalyptic never, To a Pythian height dilates you, and despair sublimes to power? LXVIII From my brain the soul-wings budded, waved a flame about my body, Whence conventions coiled to ashes. I felt self-drawn out, as man, From amalgamate false natures, and I saw the skies grow ruddy With the deepening feet of angels, and I knew what spirits can. LXIX I was mad, inspired—say either! (anguish worketh inspiration) Was a man or beast—perhaps so, for the tiger roars when speared; And I walked on, step by step along the level of my passion— Oh my soul! and passed the doorway to her face, and never feared. LXX He had left her, peradventure, when my footstep proved my coming, But for her—she half arose, then sate, grew scarlet and grew pale. Oh, she trembled! 'tis so always with a worldly man or woman In the presence of true spirits; what else can they do but quail? LXXI Oh, she fluttered like a tame bird, in among its forest brothers Far too strong for it; then drooping, bowed her face upon her hands; And I spake out wildly, fiercely, brutal truths of her and others: I, she planted in the desert, swathed her, windlike, with my sands. LXXII I plucked up her social fictions, bloody-rooted though leaf-verdant, Trod them down with words of shaming,—all the purple and the gold, All the “landed stakes” and lordships, all that spirits pure and ardent Are cast out of love and honour because chancing not to hold. LXXIII “For myself I do not argue,” said I, “though I love you, madam, But for better souls that nearer to the height of yours have trod: And this age shows, to my thinking, still more infidels to Adam Than directly, by profession, simple infidels to God. LXXIV “Yet, O God,” I said, “O grave,” I said, O mother's heart and bosom, With whom first and last are equal, saint and corpse and little child! We are fools to your deductions, in these figments of heart-closing; We are traitors to your causes, in these sympathies defiled. LXXV “Learn more reverence, madam, not for rank or wealth—that needs no learning: That comes quickly, quick as sin does, ay, and culminates to sin; But for Adam's seed, man! Trust me, 'tis a clay above your scorning, With God's image stamped upon it, and God's kindling breath within. LXXVI “What right have you, madam, gazing in your palace mirror daily, Getting so by heart your beauty which all others must adore, While you draw the golden ringlets down your fingers, to vow gaily You will wed no man that's only good to God, and nothing more? LXXVII “Why, what right have you, made fair by that same God, the sweetest woman Of all women He has fashioned, with your lovely spirit-face Which would seem too near to vanish if its smile were not so human, And your voice of holy sweetness, turning common words to grace,— LXXVIII “What right can you have, God's other works to scorn, despise, revile them In the gross, as mere men, broadly—not as noble men, forsooth,— As mere Pariahs of the outer world, forbidden to assoil them In the hope of living, dying, near that sweetness of your mouth? LXXIX “Have you any answer, madam? If my spirit were less earthly, If its instrument were gifted with a better silver string, I would kneel down where I stand, and say—Behold me! I am worthy Of thy loving, for I love thee. I am worthy as a king. LXXX “As it is—your ermined pride, I swear, shall feel this stain upon her, That I, poor, weak, tost with passion, scorned by me and you again, Love you, madam, dare to love you, to my grief and your dishonour, To my endless desolation, and your impotent disdain!” LXXXI More mad words like these—mere madness! friend, I need not write them fuller, For I hear my hot soul dropping on the lines in showers of tears. Oh, a woman! friend, a woman! why, a beast had scarce been duller Than roar bestial loud complaints against the shining of the spheres. LXXXII But at last there came a pause. I stood all vibrating with thunder Which my soul had used. The silence drew her face up like a call. Could you guess what word she uttered? She looked up, as if in wonder, With tears beaded on her lashes, and said—“Bertram!”—It was all. LXXXIII If she had cursed me, and she might have, or if even, with queenly bearing Which at need is used by women, she had risen up and said, “Sir, you are my guest, and therefore I have given you a full hearing: Now, beseech you, choose a name exacting somewhat less, instead!”— LXXXIV I had borne it: but that “Bertram”—why, it lies there on the paper A mere word, without her accent, and you cannot judge the weight Of the calm which crushed my passion: I seemed drowning in a vapour; And her gentleness destroyed me whom her scorn made desolate. LXXXV So, struck backward and exhausted by that inward flow of passion Which had rushed on, sparing nothing, into forms of abstract truth, By a logic agonising through unseemly demonstration, And by youth's own anguish turning grimly grey the hairs of youth,— LXXXVI By the sense accursed and instant, that if even I spake wisely I spake basely—using truth, if what I spake indeed was true, To avenge wrong on a woman—her, who sate there weighing nicely A poor manhood's worth, found guilty of such deeds as I could do!— LXXXVII By such wrong and woe exhausted—what I suffered and occasioned,— As a wild horse through a city runs with lightning in his eyes, And then dashing at a church's cold and passive wall, impassioned, Strikes the death into his burning brain, and blindly drops and dies— LXXXVIII So I fell, struck down before her—do you blame me, friend, for weakness? 'Twas my strength of passion slew me!—fell before her like a stone; Fast the dreadful world rolled from me on its roaring wheels of blackness: When the light came I was lying in this chamber and alone. LXXXIX Oh, of course she charged her lacqueys to bear out the sickly burden, And to cast it from her scornful sight, but not beyond the gate; She is too kind to be cruel, and too haughty not to pardon Such a man as I; 'twere something to be level to her hate. XC But for me—you now are conscious why, my friend, I write this letter, How my life is read all backward, and the charm of life undone. I shall leave her house at dawn; I would tonight, if I were better— And I charge my soul to hold my body strengthened for the sun. XCI When the sun has dyed the oriel, I depart, with no last gazes, No weak moanings (one word only, left in writing for her hands), Out of reach of all derision, and some unavailing praises, To make front against this anguish in the far and foreign lands. XCII Blame me not. I would not squander life in grief—I am abstemious. I but nurse my spirit's falcon that its wing may soar again. There's no room for tears of weakness in the blind eyes of a Phemius: Into work the poet kneads them, and he does not die till then. CONCLUSION. I Bertram finished the last pages, while along the silence ever Still in hot and heavy splashes fell the tears on every leaf. Having ended, he leans backward in his chair, with lips that quiver From the deep unspoken, ay, and deep unwritten thoughts of grief. II Soh! how still the lady standeth! 'Tis a dream—a dream of mercies! 'Twixt the purple lattice-curtains how she standeth still and pale! 'Tis a vision, sure, of mercies, sent to soften his self-curses, Sent to sweep a patient quiet o'er the tossing of his wail. III “Eyes,” he said, “now throbbing through me! are ye eyes that did undo me? Shining eyes, like antique jewels set in Parian statue-stone! Underneath that calm white forehead are ye ever burning torrid O'er the desolate sand-desert of my heart and life undone?” IV With a murmurous stir uncertain, in the air the purple curtain Swelleth in and swelleth out around her motionless pale brows, While the gliding of the river sends a rippling noise for ever Through the open casement whitened by the moonlight's slant repose. V Said he—“Vision of a lady! stand there silent, stand there steady! Now I see it plainly, plainly now I cannot hope or doubt— There, the brows of mild repression—there, the lips of silent passion, Curvèd like an archer's bow to send the bitter arrows out.” VI Ever, evermore the while in a slow silence she kept smiling, And approached him slowly, slowly, in a gliding measured pace; With her two white hands extended as if praying one offended, And a look of supplication gazing earnest in his face. VII Said he—“Wake me by no gesture,—sound of breath, or stir of vesture! Let the blessèd apparition melt not yet to its divine! No approaching—hush, no breathing! or my heart must swoon to death in The too utter life thou bringest, O thou dream of Geraldine!” VIII Ever, evermore the while in a slow silence she kept smiling, But the tears ran over lightly from her eyes and tenderly:— “Dost thou, Bertram, truly love me? Is no woman far above me Found more worthy of thy poet-heart than such a one as I?” IX Said he—“I would dream so ever, like the flowing of that river, Flowing ever in a shadow greenly onward to the sea! So, thou vision of all sweetness, princely to a full completeness Would my heart and life flow onward, deathward, through this dream of thee!” X Ever, evermore the while in a slow silence she kept smiling, While the silver tears ran faster down the blushing of her cheeks; Then with both her hands enfolding both of his, she softly told him, “Bertram, if I say I love thee, . . . 'tis the vision only speaks.” XI Softened, quickened to adore her, on his knee he fell before her, And she whispered low in triumph, “It shall be as I have sworn. Very rich he is in virtues, very noble—noble, certes; And I shall not blush in knowing that men call him lowly born.” A VISION OF POETS. “O Sacred Essence, lighting me this hour, How may I lightly stile thy great power?Echo. Power. Power! but of whence? under the greenwood spraye? Or liv'st in Heaven? saye.Echo. In Heavens aye. In Heavens aye! tell, may I it obtayne By alms, by fasting, prayer,—by paine?Echo. By paine. Show me the paine, it shall be undergone: I to mine end will still go on.Echo. Go on.” —Britannia's Pastorals. A poet could not sleep aright, For his soul kept up too much light Under his eyelids for the night. And thus he rose disquieted With sweet rhymes ringing through his head, And in the forest wanderèd Where, sloping up the darkest glades, The moon had drawn long colonnades Upon whose floor the verdure fades To a faint silver: pavement fair, The antique wood-nymphs scarce would dare To foot-print o'er, had such been there, And rather sit by breathlessly, With fear in their large eyes, to see The consecrated sight. But he— The poet who, with spirit-kiss Familiar, had long claimed for his Whatever earthly beauty is, Who also in his spirit bore A beauty passing the earth's store,— Walked calmly onward evermore. His aimless thoughts in metre went, Like a babe's hand without intent Drawn down a seven-stringed instrument: Nor jarred it with his humour as, With a faint stirring of the grass, An apparition fair did pass. He might have feared another time, But all things fair and strange did chime With his thoughts then, as rhyme to rhyme. An angel had not startled him, Alighted from heaven's burning rim To breathe from glory in the Dim; Much less a lady riding slow Upon a palfrey white as snow, And smooth as a snow-cloud could go. Full upon his she turned her face, “What ho, sir poet! dost thou pace Our woods at night in ghostly chase “Of some fair Dryad of old tales Who chants between the nightingales And over sleep by song prevails?” She smiled; but he could see arise Her soul from far adown her eyes, Prepared as if for sacrifice. She looked a queen who seemeth gay From royal grace alone. “Now, nay,” He answered, “slumber passed away, “Compelled by instincts in my head That I should see to-night, instead Of a fair nymph, some fairer Dread.” She looked up quickly to the sky And spake: “The moon's regality Will hear no praise; She is as I. “She is in heaven, and I on earth; This is my kingdom: I come forth To crown all poets to their worth.” He brake in with a voice that mourned; “To their worth, lady? They are scorned By men they sing for, till inurned. “To their worth? Beauty in the mind Leaves the hearth cold, and love-refined Ambitions make the world unkind. “The boor who ploughs the daisy down, The chief whose mortgage of renown, Fixed upon graves, has bought a crown— “Both these are happier, more approved Than poets!—why should I be moved In saying, both are more beloved?” “The south can judge not of the north,” She resumed calmly; “I come forth To crown all poets to their worth. “Yea, verily, to anoint them all With blessèd oils which surely shall Smell sweeter as the ages fall.” “As sweet,” the poet said, and rung A low sad laugh, “as flowers are, sprung Out of their graves when they die young; “As sweet as window-eglantine, Some bough of which, as they decline, The hired nurse gathers at their sign: “As sweet, in short, as perfumed shroud Which the gay Roman maidens sewed For English Keats, singing aloud.” The lady answered, “Yea, as sweet! The things thou namest being complete In fragrance, as I measure it. “Since sweet the death-clothes and the knell Of him who having lived, dies well; And wholly sweet the asphodel “Stirred softly by that foot of his, When he treads brave on all that is, Into the world of souls, from this. “Since sweet the tears, dropped at the door Of tearless Death, and even before: Sweet, consecrated evermore. “What, dost thou judge it a strange thing That poets, crowned for vanquishing, Should bear some dust from out the ring? “Come on with me, come on with me, And learn in coming: let me free Thy spirit into verity.” She ceased: her palfrey's paces sent No separate noises as she went; 'Twas a bee's hum, a little spent. And while the poet seemed to tread Along the drowsy noise so made, The forest heaved up overhead Its billowy foliage through the air, And the calm stars did far and spare O'erswim the masses everywhere; Save when the overtopping pines Did bar their tremulous light with lines All fixed and black. Now the moon shines A broader glory. You may see The trees grow rarer presently; The air blows up more fresh and free: Until they come from dark to light, And from the forest to the sight Of the large heaven-heart, bare with night, A fiery throb in every star, Those burning arteries that are The conduits of God's life afar,— A wild brown moorland underneath, And four pools breaking up the heath With white low gleamings, blank as death. Beside the first pool, near the wood, A dead tree in set horror stood, Peeled and disjointed, stark as rood; Since thunder-stricken, years ago, Fixed in the spectral strain and throe Wherewith it struggled from the blow: A monumental tree, alone, That will not bend in storms, nor groan, But break off sudden like a stone. Its lifeless shadow lies oblique Upon the pool where, javelin-like, The star-rays quiver while they strike. “Drink,” said the lady, very still— “Be holy and cold.” He did her will And drank the starry water chill. The next pool they came near unto Was bare of trees; there, only grew Straight flags, and lilies just a few Which sullen on the water sate And leant their faces on the flat, As weary of the starlight-state. “Drink,” said the lady, grave and slow— “World's use behoveth thee to know.” He drank the bitter wave below. The third pool, girt with thorny bushes And flaunting weeds and reeds and rushes That winds sang through in mournful gushes, Was whitely smeared in many a round By a slow slime; the starlight swound Over the ghastly light it found. “Drink,” said the lady, sad and slow— “World's love behoveth thee to know.” He looked to her commanding so; Her brow was troubled, but her eye Struck clear to his soul. For all reply He drank the water suddenly,— Then, with a deathly sickness, passed Beside the fourth pool and the last, Where weights of shadow were downcast From yew and alder and rank trails Of nightshade clasping the trunk-scales And flung across the intervals From yew to yew: who dares to stoop Where those dank branches overdroop, Into his heart the chill strikes up; He hears a silent gliding coil, The snakes strain hard against the soil, His foot slips in their slimy oil, And toads seem crawling on his hand, And clinging bats but dimly scanned Full in his face their wings expand. A paleness took the poet's cheek: “Must I drink here?” he seemed to seek The lady's will with utterance meek: “Ay, ay,” she said, “it so must be;” (And this time she spake cheerfully) ‘Behoves thee know World's cruelty.” He bowed his forehead till his mouth Curved in the wave, and drank unloth As if from rivers of the south; His lips sobbed through the water rank, His heart paused in him while he drank, His brain beat heart-like, rose and sank, And he swooned backward to a dream Wherein he lay 'twixt gloom and gleam, With Death and Life at each extreme: And spiritual thunders, born of soul Not cloud, did leap from mystic pole And o'er him roll and counter-roll, Crushing their echoes reboant With their own wheels. Did Heaven so grant His spirit a sign of covenant? At last came silence. A slow kiss Did crown his forehead after this; His eyelids flew back for the bliss— The lady stood beside his head, Smiling a thought, with hair dispread; The moonshine seemed dishevellèd In her sleek tresses manifold Like Danaë's in the rain of old That dripped with melancholy gold: But she was holy, pale and high As one who saw an ecstasy Beyond a foretold agony. “Rise up!” said she with voice where song Eddied through speech, “rise up; be strong: And learn how right avenges wrong.” The poet rose up on his feet: He stood before an altar set For sacrament with vessels meet And mystic altar-lights which shine As if their flames were crystalline Carved flames that would not shrink or pine. The altar filled the central place Of a great church, and toward its face Long aisles did shoot and interlace, And from it a continuous mist Of incense (round the edges kissed By a yellow light of amethyst) Wound upward slowly and throbbingly, Cloud within cloud, right silverly, Cloud above cloud, victoriously,— Broke full against the archèd roof And thence refracting eddied off And floated through the marble woof Of many a fine-wrought architrave, Then, poising its white masses brave, Swept solemnly down aisle and nave Where, now in dark and now in light, The countless columns, glimmering white, Seemed leading out to the Infinite: Plunged halfway up the shaft, they showed In that pale shifting incense-cloud Which flowed them by and overflowed Till mist and marble seemed to blend, And the whole temple, at the end, With its own incense to distend,— The arches like a giant's bow To bend and slacken,—and below, The nichèd saints to come and go: Alone amid the shifting scene That central altar stood serene In its clear steadfast taper-sheen. Then first, the poet was aware Of a chief angel standing there Before that altar, in the glare. His eyes were dreadful, for you saw That they saw God; his lips and jaw Grand-made and strong, as Sinai's Law They could enunciate and refrain From vibratory after-pain, And his brow's height was sovereign. On the vast background of his wings Rises his image, and he flings From each plumed arc pale glitterings And fiery flakes (as beateth, more Or less, the angel-heart) before And round him upon roof and floor, Edging with fire the shifting fumes, While at his side 'twixt lights and glooms The phantasm of an organ booms. Extending from which instrument And angel, right and left-way bent, The poet's sight grew sentient Of a strange company around And toward the altar; pale and bound With bay above the eyes profound. Deathful their faces were, and yet The power of life was in them set— Never forgot nor to forget: Sublime significance of mouth, Dilated nostril full of youth, And forehead royal with the truth. These faces were not multiplied Beyond your count, but side by side Did front the altar, glorified, Still as a vision, yet exprest Full as an action—look and geste Of buried saint in risen rest. The poet knew them. Faint and dim His spirits seemed to sink in him— Then, like a dolphin, change and swim The current: these were poets true, Who died for Beauty as martyrs do For Truth—the ends being scarcely two. God's prophets of the Beautiful These poets were; of iron rule, The rugged cilix, serge of wool. Here Homer, with the broad suspense Of thunderous brows, and lips intense Of garrulous god-innocence. There Shakespeare, on whose forehead climb The crowns o' the world: O eyes sublime With tears and laughters for all time! Here Æschylus, the women swooned To see so awful, when he frowned As the gods did: he standeth crowned. Euripides, with close and mild Scholastic lips, that could be wild And laugh or sob out like a child Even in the classes. Sophocles, With that king's-look which down the trees Followed the dark effigies Of the lost Theban. Hesiod old, Who, somewhat blind and deaf and cold, Cared most for gods and bulls. And bold Electric Pindar, quick as fear, With race-dust on his cheeks, and clear Slant startled eyes that seem to hear The chariot rounding the last goal, To hurtle past it in his soul. And Sappho, with that gloriole Of ebon hair on calmèd brows— O poet-woman! none forgoes The leap, attaining the repose. Theocritus, with glittering locks Dropt sideway, as betwixt the rocks He watched the visionary flocks. And Aristophanes, who took The world with mirth, and laughter-struck The hollow caves of Thought and woke The infinite echoes hid in each. And Virgil: shade of Mantuan beech Did help the shade of bay to reach And knit around his forehead high: For his gods wore less majesty Than his brown bees hummed deathlessly. Lucretius, nobler than his mood, Who dropped his plummet down the broad Deep universe and said “No God—” Finding no bottom: he denied Divinely the divine, and died Chief poet on the Tiber-side By grace of God: his face is stern As one compelled, in spite of scorn, To teach a truth he would not learn. And Ossian, dimly seen or guessed; Once counted greater than the rest, When mountain-winds blew out his vest. And Spenser drooped his dreaming head (With languid sleep-smile you had said From his own verse engenderèd) On Ariosto's, till they ran Their curls in one: the Italian Shot nimbler heat of bolder man From his fine lids. And Dante stern And sweet, whose spirit was an urn For wine and milk poured out in turn. Hard-souled Alfieri; and fancy-willed Boiardo, who with laughter filled The pauses of the jostled shield. And Berni, with a hand stretched out To sleek that storm. And, not without The wreath he died in and the doubt He died by, Tasso, bard and lover, Whose visions were too thin to cover The face of a false woman over. And soft Racine; and grave Corneille, The orator of rhymes, whose wail Scarce shook his purple. And Petrarch pale, From whose brain-lighted heart were thrown A thousand thoughts beneath the sun, Each lucid with the name of One. And Camoens, with that look he had, Compelling India's Genius sad From the wave through the Lusiad,— The murmurs of the storm-cape ocean Indrawn in vibrative emotion Along the verse. And, while devotion In his wild eyes fantastic shone Under the tonsure blown upon By airs celestial, Calderon. And bold De Vega, who breathed quick Verse after verse, till death's old trick Put pause to life and rhetoric. And Goethe, with that reaching eye His soul reached out from, far and high, And fell from inner entity. And Schiller, with heroic front Worthy of Plutarch's kiss upon't, Too large for wreath of modern wont. And Chaucer, with his infantine Familiar clasp of things divine; That mark upon his lip is wine. Here, Milton's eyes strike piercing-dim: The shapes of suns and stars did swim Like clouds from them, and granted him God for sole vision. Cowley, there, Whose active fancy debonair Drew straws like amber—foul to fair. Drayton and Browne, with smiles they drew From outward nature, still kept new From their own inward nature true. And Marlowe, Webster, Fletcher, Ben, Whose fire-hearts sowed our furrows when The world was worthy of such men. And Burns, with pungent passionings Set in his eyes: deep lyric springs Are of the fire-mount's issuings. And Shelley, in his white ideal, All statue-blind. And Keats the real Adonis with the hymeneal Fresh vernal buds half sunk between His youthful curls, kissed straight and sheen In his Rome-grave, by Venus queen. And poor, proud Byron, sad as grave And salt as life; forlornly brave, And quivering with the dart he drave. And visionary Coleridge, who Did sweep his thoughts as angels do Their wings with cadence up the Blue. These poets faced (and many more) The lighted altar looming o'er The clouds of incense dim and hoar: And all their faces, in the lull Of natural things, looked wonderful With life and death and deathless rule. All, still as stone and yet intense; As if by spirit's vehemence That stone were carved and not by sense. But where the heart of each should beat, There seemed a wound instead of it, From whence the blood dropped to their feet Drop after drop—dropped heavily As century follows century Into the deep eternity. Then said the lady—and her word Came distant, as wide waves were stirred Between her and the ear that heard,— “World's use is cold, world's love is vain, World's cruelty is bitter bane, But pain is not the fruit of pain. “Hearken, O poet, whom I led From the dark wood: dismissing dread, Now hear this angel in my stead. “His organ's clavier strikes along These poets' hearts, sonorous, strong, They gave him without count of wrong,— “A diapason whence to guide Up to God's feet, from these who died, An anthem fully glorified— “Whereat God's blessing, Ibarak [HEBREW] Breathes back this music, folds it back About the earth in vapoury rack, “And men walk in it, crying ‘Lo The world is wider, and we know The very heavens look brighter so: “‘The stars move statelier round the edge Of the silver spheres, and give in pledge Their light for nobler privilege: “‘No little flower but joys or grieves, Full life is rustling in the sheaves, Full spirit sweeps the forest-leaves.’ “So works this music on the earth, God so admits it, sends it forth To add another worth to worth— “A new creation-bloom that rounds The old creation and expounds His Beautiful in tuneful sounds. “Now hearken!” Then the poet gazed Upon the angel glorious-faced Whose hand, majestically raised, Floated across the organ-keys, Like a pale moon o'er murmuring seas, With no touch but with influences: Then rose and fell (with swell and swound Of shapeless noises wandering round A concord which at last they found) Those mystic keys: the tones were mixed, Dim, faint, and thrilled and throbbed betwixt The incomplete and the unfixed: And therein mighty minds were heard In mighty musings, inly stirred, And struggling outward for a word: Until these surges, having run This way and that, gave out as one An Aphroditè of sweet tune, A Harmony that, finding vent, Upward in grand ascension went, Winged to a heavenly argument, Up, upward like a saint who strips The shroud back from his eyes and lips, And rises in apocalypse: A Harmony sublime and plain, Which cleft (as flying swan, the rain,— Throwing the drops off with a strain Of her white wing) those undertones Of perplext chords, and soared at once And struck out from the starry thrones Their several silver octaves as It passed to God. The music was Of divine stature; strong to pass: And those who heard it, understood Something of life in spirit and blood, Something of nature's fair and good: And while it sounded, those great souls Did thrill as racers at the goals And burn in all their aureoles; But she the lady, as vapour-bound, Stood calmly in the joy of sound, Like Nature with the showers around: And when it ceased, the blood which fell Again, alone grew audible, Tolling the silence as a bell. The sovran angel lifted high His hand, and spake out sovranly: “Tried poets, hearken and reply! “Give me true answers. If we grant That not to suffer, is to want The conscience of the jubilant,— “If ignorance of anguish is But ignorance, and mortals miss Far prospects, by a level bliss,— “If, as two colours must be viewed In a visible image, mortals should Need good and evil, to see good,— “If to speak nobly, comprehends To feel profoundly,—if the ends Of power and suffering, Nature blends,— “If poets on the tripod must Writhe like the Pythian to make just Their oracles and merit trust,— “If every vatic word that sweeps To change the world must pale their lips And leave their own souls in eclipse,— “If to search deep the universe Must pierce the searcher with the curse, Because that bolt (in man's reverse) “Was shot to the heart o' the wood and lies Wedged deepest in the best,—if eyes That look for visions and surprise “From influent angels, must shut down Their eyelids first to sun and moon, The head asleep upon a stone,— “If One who did redeem you back, By His own loss, from final wrack, Did consecrate by touch and track “Those temporal sorrows till the taste Of brackish waters of the waste Is salt with tears He dropt too fast,— “If all the crowns of earth must wound With prickings of the thorns He found,— If saddest sighs swell sweetest sound,— “What say ye unto this?—refuse This baptism in salt water?—choose Calm breasts, mute lips, and labour loose? “Or, O ye gifted givers! ye Who give your liberal hearts to me To make the world this harmony, “Are ye resigned that they be spent To such world's help?” The Spirits bent Their awful brows and said “Content.” Content! it sounded like Amen Said by a choir of mourning men; An affirmation full of pain And patience,—ay, of glorying And adoration, as a king Might seal an oath for governing. Then said the angel—and his face Lightened abroad until the place Grew larger for a moment's space,— The long aisles flashing out in light, And nave and transept, columns white And arches crossed, being clear to sight As if the roof were off and all Stood in the noon-sun,—“Lo, I call To other hearts as liberal. “This pedal strikes out in the air: My instrument has room to bear Still fuller strains and perfecter. “Herein is room, and shall be room While Time lasts, for new hearts to come Consummating while they consume. “What living man will bring a gift Of his own heart and help to lift The tune?—The race is to the swift.” So asked the angel. Straight the while, A company came up the aisle With measured step and sorted smile; Cleaving the incense-clouds that rise, With winking unaccustomed eyes And love-locks smelling sweet of spice. One bore his head above the rest As if the world were dispossessed, And one did pillow chin on breast, Right languid, an as he should faint; One shook his curls across his paint And moralised on worldly taint; One, slanting up his face, did wink The salt rheum to the eyelid's brink, To think—O gods! or—not to think. Some trod out stealthily and slow, As if the sun would fall in snow If they walked to instead of fro; And some, with conscious ambling free, Did shake their bells right daintily On hand and foot, for harmony; And some, composing sudden sighs In attitudes of point-device, Rehearsed impromptu agonies. And when this company drew near The spirits crowned, it might appear Submitted to a ghastly fear; As a sane eye in master-passion Constrains a maniac to the fashion Of hideous maniac imitation In the least geste—the dropping low O' the lid, the wrinkling of the brow, Exaggerate with mock and mow,— So mastered was that company By the crowned vision utterly, Swayed to a maniac mockery. One dulled his eyeballs, as they ached With Homer's forehead, though he lacked An inch of any; and one racked His lower lip with restless tooth, As Pindar's rushing words forsooth Were pent behind it; one his smooth Pink cheeks did rumple passionate Like Æschylus, and tried to prate On trolling tongue of fate and fate; One set her eyes like Sappho's—or Any light woman's; one forbore Like Dante, or any man as poor In mirth, to let a smile undo His hard-shut lips; and one that drew Sour humours from his mother, blew His sunken cheeks out to the size Of most unnatural jollities, Because Anacreon looked jest-wise; So with the rest: it was a sight A great world-laughter would requite, Or great world-wrath, with equal right. Out came a speaker from that crowd To speak for all, in sleek and proud Exordial periods, while he bowed His knee before the angel—“Thus, O angel who hast called for us, We bring thee service emulous. “Fit service from sufficient soul, Hand-service to receive world's dole, Lip-service in world's ear to roll “Adjusted concords—soft enow To hear the wine-cups passing, through, And not too grave to spoil the show: “Thou, certes, when thou askest more, O sapient angel, leanest o'er The window-sill of metaphor. “To give our hearts up? fie! that rage Barbaric antedates the age; It is not done on any stage. “Because your scald or gleeman went With seven or nine-stringed instrument Upon his back,—must ours be bent? “We are not pilgrims, by your leave; No, nor yet martyrs; if we grieve, It is to rhyme to—summer eve: “And if we labour, it shall be As suiteth best with our degree, In after-dinner reverie.” More yet that speaker would have said, Poising between his smiles fair-fed Each separate phrase till finishèd; But all the foreheads of those born And dead true poets flashed with scorn Betwixt the bay leaves round them worn, Ay, jetted such brave fire that they, The new-come, shrank and paled away Like leaden ashes when the day Strikes on the hearth. A spirit-blast, A presence known by power, at last Took them up mutely: they had passed. And he our pilgrim-poet saw Only their places, in deep awe, What time the angel's smile did draw His gazing upward. Smiling on, The angel in the angel shone, Revealing glory in benison; Till, ripened in the light which shut The poet in, his spirit mute Dropped sudden as a perfect fruit: He fell before the angel's feet, Saying, “If what is true is sweet, In something I may compass it: “For, where my worthiness is poor, My will stands richly at the door To pay shortcomings evermore. “Accept me therefore: not for price And not for pride my sacrifice Is tendered, for my soul is nice “And will beat down those dusty seeds Of bearded corn if she succeeds In soaring while the covey feeds. “I soar, I am drawn up like the lark To its white cloud: so high my mark, Albeit my wing is small and dark. “I ask no wages, seek no fame: Sew me, for shroud round face and name, God's banner of the oriflamme. “I only would have leave to loose (In tears and blood if so He choose) Mine inward music out to use; “I only would be spent—in pain And loss, perchance, but not in vain— Upon the sweetness of that strain; “Only project beyond the bound Of mine own life, so lost and found, My voice, and live on in its sound; “Only embrace and be embraced By fiery ends, whereby to waste, And light God's future with my past.” The angel's smile grew more divine, The mortal speaking; ay, its shine Swelled fuller, like a choir-note fine, Till the broad glory round his brow Did vibrate with the light below; But what he said I do not know. Nor know I if the man who prayed, Rose up accepted, unforbade, From the church-floor where he was laid,— Nor if a listening life did run Through the king-poets, one by one Rejoicing in a worthy son: My soul, which might have seen, grew blind By what it looked on: I can find No certain count of things behind. I saw alone, dim, white and grand As in a dream, the angel's hand Stretched forth in gesture of command Straight through the haze. And so, as erst, A strain more noble than the first Mused in the organ, and outburst: With giant march from floor to roof Rose the full notes, now parted off In pauses massively aloof Like measured thunders, now rejoined In concords of mysterious kind Which fused together sense and mind, Now flashing sharp on sharp along Exultant in a mounting throng, Now dying off to a low song Fed upon minors, wavelike sounds Re-eddying into silver rounds, Enlarging liberty with bounds: And every rhythm that seemed to close Survived in confluent underflows Symphonious with the next that rose. Thus the whole strain being multiplied And greatened, with its glorified Wings shot abroad from side to side, Waved backward (as a wind might wave A Brocken mist and with as brave Wild roaring) arch and architrave, Aisle, transept, column, marble wall,— Then swelling outward, prodigal Of aspiration beyond thrall, Soared, and drew up with it the whole Of this said vision, as a soul Is raised by a thought. And as a scroll Of bright devices is unrolled Still upward with a gradual gold, So rose the vision manifold, Angel and organ, and the round Of spirits, solemnised and crowned; While the freed clouds of incense wound Ascending, following in their track, And glimmering faintly like the rack O' the moon in her own light cast back. And as that solemn dream withdrew, The lady's kiss did fall anew Cold on the poet's brow as dew. And that same kiss which bound him first Beyond the senses, now reversed Its own law and most subtly pierced His spirit with the sense of things Sensual and present. Vanishings Of glory with Æolian wings Struck him and passed: the lady's face Did melt back in the chrysopras Of the orient morning sky that was Yet clear of lark and there and so She melted as a star might do, Still smiling as she melted slow: Smiling so slow, he seemed to see Her smile the last thing, gloriously Beyond her, far as memory. Then he looked round: he was alone. He lay before the breaking sun, As Jacob at the Bethel stone. And thought's entangled skein being wound, He knew the moorland of his swound, And the pale pools that smeared the ground; The far wood-pines like offing ships; The fourth pool's yew anear him drips, World's cruelty attaints his lips, And still he tastes it, bitter still; Through all that glorious possible He had the sight of present ill. Yet rising calmly up and slowly With such a cheer as scorneth folly, A mild delightsome melancholy, He journeyed homeward through the wood And prayed along the solitude Betwixt the pines, “O God, my God!” The golden morning's open flowings Did sway the trees to murmurous bowings, In metric chant of blessed poems. And passing homeward through the wood, He prayed along the solitude, Thou, Poet-God, art great and good! “And though we must have, and have had Right reason to be earthly sad, Thou, Poet-God, art great and glad!” CONCLUSION. Life treads on life, and heart on heart; We press too close in church and mart To keep a dream or grave apart: And I was 'ware of walking down That same green forest where had gone The poet-pilgrim. One by one I traced his footsteps. From the east A red and tender radiance pressed Through the near trees, until I guessed The sun behind shone full and round; While up the leafiness profound A wind scarce old enough for sound Stood ready to blow on me when I turned that way, and now and then The birds sang and brake off again To shake their pretty feathers dry Of the dew sliding droppingly From the leaf-edges and apply Back to their song: 'twixt dew and bird So sweet a silence ministered, God seemed to use it for a word, Yet morning souls did leap and run In all things, as the least had won A joyous insight of the sun, And no one looking round the wood Could help confessing as he stood, This Poet-God is glad and good. But hark! a distant sound that grows, A heaving, sinking of the boughs, A rustling murmur, not of those, A breezy noise which is not breeze! And white-clad children by degrees Steal out in troops among the trees, Fair little children morning-bright, With faces grave yet soft to sight, Expressive of restrained delight. Some plucked the palm-boughs within reach, And others leapt up high to catch The upper boughs and shake from each A rain of dew till, wetted so, The child who held the branch let go And it swang backward with a flow Of faster drippings. Then I knew The children laughed; but the laugh flew From its own chirrup as might do A frightened song-bird; and a child Who seemed the chief said very mild, “Hush! keep this morning undefiled.” His eyes rebuked them from calm spheres; His soul upon his brow appears In waiting for more holy years. I called the child to me, and said, “What are your palms for?” “To be spread,” He answered, “on a poet dead. “The poet died last month, and now The world which had been somewhat slow In honouring his living brow, “Commands the palms; they must be strown On his new marble very soon, In a procession of the town.” I sighed and said, “Did he foresee Any such honour?” “Verily I cannot tell you,” answered he. “But this I know, I fain would lay My own head down, another day, As he did,—with the fame away. “A lily, a friend's hand had plucked, Lay by his death-bed, which he looked As deep down as a bee had sucked, “Then, turning to the lattice, gazed O'er hill and river and upraised His eyes illumined and amazed “With the world's beauty, up to God, Re-offering on their iris broad The images of things bestowed “By the chief Poet. ‘God!’ he cried, ‘Be praised for anguish which has tried, For beauty which has satisfied: “‘For this world's presence half within And half without me—thought and scene— This sense of Being and Having Been. “‘I thank Thee that my soul hath room For Thy grand world: both guests may come— Beauty, to soul—Body, to tomb. “‘I am content to be so weak: Put strength into the words I speak, And I am strong in what I seek. “‘I am content to be so bare Before the archers, everywhere My wounds being stroked by heavenly air. “‘I laid my soul before Thy feet That images of fair and sweet Should walk to other men on it. “‘I am content to feel the step Of each pure image: let those keep To mandragore who care to sleep. “‘I am content to touch the brink Of the other goblet and I think My bitter drink a wholesome drink. “‘Because my portion was assigned Wholesome and bitter, Thou art kind, And I am blessèd to my mind. “‘Gifted for giving, I receive The maythorn and its scent outgive: I grieve not that I once did grieve. “‘In my large joy of sight and touch Beyond what others count for such, I am content to suffer much. “‘I know—is all the mourner saith, Knowledge by suffering entereth, And Life is perfected by Death.’” The child spake nobly: strange to hear, His infantine soft accents clear Charged with high meanings, did appear; And fair to see, his form and face Winged out with whiteness and pure grace From the green darkness of the place. Behind his head a palm-tree grew; An orient beam which pierced it through Transversely on his forehead drew The figure of a palm-branch brown Traced on its brightness up and down In fine fair lines,—a shadow-crown: Guido might paint his angels so— A little angel, taught to go With holy words to saints below— Such innocence of action yet Significance of object met In his whole bearing strong and sweet. And all the children, the whole band, Did round in rosy reverence stand, Each with a palm-bough in his hand. “And so he died,” I whispered. “Nay, Not so,” the childish voice did say, “That poet turned him first to pray “In silence, and God heard the rest 'Twixt the sun's footsteps down the west. Then he called one who loved him best, “Yea, he called softly through the room (His voice was weak yet tender)—‘Come,’ He said, ‘come nearer! Let the bloom “‘Of Life grow over, undenied, This bridge of Death, which is not wide— I shall be soon at the other side. “‘Come, kiss me!’ So the one in truth Who loved him best,—in love, not ruth, Bowed down and kissed him mouth to mouth: “And in that kiss of love was won Life's manumission. All was done: The mouth that kissed last, kissed alone. “But in the former, confluent kiss, The same was sealed, I think, by His, To words of truth and uprightness.” The child's voice trembled, his lips shook Like a rose leaning o'er a brook, Which vibrates though it is not struck. “And who,” I asked, a little moved Yet curious-eyed, “was this that loved And kissed him last, as it behoved?” “I,” softly said the child; and then “I,” said he louder, once again: “His son, my rank is among men: “And now that men exalt his name I come to gather palms with them, That holy love may hallow fame. “He did not die alone, nor should His memory live so, 'mid these rude World-praisers—a worse solitude. “Me, a voice calleth to that tomb Where these are strewing branch and bloom, Saying, ‘Come nearer:’ and I come. “Glory to God!” resumèd he, And his eyes smiled for victory O'er their own tears which I could see Fallen on the palm, down cheek and chin— “That poet now has entered in The place of rest which is not sin. “And while he rests, his songs in troops Walk up and down our earthly slopes, Companioned by diviner hopes.” “But thou,” I murmured to engage The child's speech farther—“hast an age Too tender for this orphanage.” “Glory to God—to God!” he saith: “Knowledge by suffering entereth, And Life is perfected by Death.” RHYME OF THE DUCHESS MAY. I To the belfry, one by one, went the ringers from the sun, Toll slowly. And the oldest ringer said, “Ours is music for the dead When the rebecks are all done.” II Six abeles i' the churchyard grow on the north side in a row, Toll slowly. And the shadows of their tops rock across the little slopes Of the grassy graves below. III On the south side and the west a small river runs in haste, Toll slowly. And, between the river flowing and the fair green trees a-growing, Do the dead lie at their rest. IV On the east I sate that day, up against a willow grey: Toll slowly. Through the rain of willow-branches I could see the low hill-ranges And the river on its way. V There I sate beneath the tree, and the bell tolled solemnly, Toll slowly. While the trees' and river's voices flowed between the solemn noises,— Yet death seemed more loud to me. VI There I read this ancient rhyme while the bell did all the time Toll slowly. And the solemn knell fell in with the tale of life and sin, Like a rhythmic fate sublime. THE RHYME. I Broad the forests stood (I read) on the hills of Linteged, Toll slowly. And three hundred years had stood mute adown each hoary wood, Like a full heart having prayed. II And the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west, Toll slowly. And but little thought was theirs of the silent antique years, In the building of their nest. III Down the sun dropt large and red on the towers of Linteged,— Toll slowly. Lance and spear upon the height, bristling strange in fiery light, While the castle stood in shade. IV There the castle stood up black with the red sun at its back— Toll slowly— Like a sullen smouldering pyre with a top that flickers fire When the wind is on its track. V And five hundred archers tall did besiege the castle wall— Toll slowly. And the castle, seethed in blood, fourteen days and nights had stood And to-night was near its fall. VI Yet thereunto, blind to doom, three months since, a bride did come— Toll slowly. One who proudly trod the floors and softly whispered in the doors, “May good angels bless our home.” VII Oh, a bride of queenly eyes, with a front of constancies: Toll slowly. Oh, a bride of cordial mouth where the untired smile of youth Did light outward its own sighs! VIII 'Twas a Duke's fair orphan-girl, and her uncle's ward—the Earl— Toll slowly. Who betrothed her twelve years old, for the sake of dowry gold, To his son Lord Leigh the churl. IX But what time she had made good all her years of womanhood— Toll slowly. Unto both these lords of Leigh spake she out right sovranly, “My will runneth as my blood. X “And while this same blood makes red this same right hand's veins,” she said— Toll slowly— “'Tis my will, as lady free, not to wed a lord of Leigh, But Sir Guy of Linteged.” XI The old Earl he smilèd smooth, then he sighed for wilful youth— Toll slowly “Good my niece, that hand withal looketh somewhat soft and small For so large a will, in sooth.” XII She too smiled by that same sign, but her smile was cold and fine— Toll slowly. “Little hand clasps muckle gold, or it were not worth the hold Of thy son, good uncle mine!” XIII Then the young lord jerked his breath, and sware thickly in his teeth— Toll slowly— “He would wed his own betrothed, an she loved him an she loathed, Let the life come or the death.” XIV Up she rose with scornful eyes, as her father's child might rise— Toll slowly. “Thy hound's blood, my lord of Leigh, stains thy knightly heel,” quoth she, “And he moans not where he lies: XV “But a woman's will dies hard, in the hall or on the sward”— Toll slowly. “By that grave, my lords, which made me orphaned girl and dowered lady, I deny you wife and ward!” XVI Unto each she bowed her head and swept past with lofty tread. Toll slowly. Ere the midnight-bell had ceased, in the chapel had the priest Blessed her, bride of Linteged. XVII Fast and fain the bridal train along the night-storm rode amain— Toll slowly. Hard the steeds of lord and serf struck their hoofs out on the turf, In the pauses of the rain. XVIII Fast and fain the kinsmen's train along the storm pursued amain— Toll slowly. Steed on steed-track, dashing off,—thickening, doubling, hoof on hoof, In the pauses of the rain. XIX And the bridegroom led the flight on his red-roan steed of might— Toll slowly. And the bride lay on his arm, still, as if she feared no harm, Smiling out into the night. XX “Dost thou fear?” he said at last. “Nay,” she answered him in haste,— Toll slowly. “Not such death as we could find—only life with one behind. Ride on fast as fear, ride fast!” XXI Up the mountain wheeled the steed—girth to ground, and fetlocks spread— Toll slowly. Headlong bounds, and rocking flanks,—down he staggered, down the banks, To the towers of Linteged. XXII High and low the serfs looked out, red the flambeaus tossed about— Toll slowly. In the courtyard rose the cry, “Live the Duchess and Sir Guy!” But she never heard them shout. XXIII On the steed she dropped her cheek, kissed his mane and kissed his neck— Toll slowly. “I had happier died by thee than lived on, a Lady Leigh,” Were the first words she did speak. XXIV But a three months' joyaunce lay 'twixt that moment and to-day— Toll slowly. When five hundred archers tall stand beside the castle wall To recapture Duchess May. XXV And the castle standeth black with the red sun at its back— Toll slowly. And a fortnight's siege is done, and, except the duchess, none Can misdoubt the coming wrack. XXVI Then the captain, young Lord Leigh, with his eyes so grey of blee— Toll slowly. And thin lips that scarcely sheathe the cold white gnashing of his teeth, Gnashed in smiling, absently,— XXVII Cried aloud, “So goes the day, bridegroom fair of Duchess May!” Toll slowly. “Look thy last upon that sun! if thou seest to-morrow's one 'Twill be through a foot of clay. XXVIII “Ha, fair bride! dost hear no sound save that moaning of the hound?” Toll slowly. “Thou and I have parted troth, yet I keep my vengeance-oath, And the other may come round. XXIX “Ha! thy will is brave to dare, and thy new love past compare”— Toll slowly. “Yet thine old love's falchion brave is as strong a thing to have, As the will of lady fair. XXX “Peck on blindly, netted dove! If a wife's name thee behove”— Toll slowly— “Thou shalt wear the same to-morrow, ere the grave has hid the sorrow Of thy last ill-mated love. XXXI “O'er his fixed and silent mouth, thou and I will call back troth”: Toll slowly. “He shall altar be and priest,—and he will not cry at least ‘I forbid you, I am loth!’ XXXII “I will wring thy fingers pale in the gauntlet of my mail”: Toll slowly. “‘Little hand and muckle gold’ close shall lie within my hold, As the sword did, to prevail.” XXXIII Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west— Toll slowly. Oh, and laughed the Duchess May, and her soul did put away All his boasting, for a jest. XXXIV In her chamber did she sit, laughing low to think of it,— Toll slowly. “Tower is strong and will is free: thou canst boast, my lord of Leigh, But thou boastest little wit.” XXXV In her tire-glass gazèd she, and she blushed right womanly— Toll slowly. She blushed half from her disdain, half her beauty was so plain, —“Oath for oath, my lord of Leigh!” XXXVI Straight she called her maidens in—“Since ye gave me blame herein”— Toll slowly— “That a bridal such as mine should lack gauds to make it fine, Come and shrive me from that sin. XXXVII “It is three months gone to-day since I gave mine hand away”: Toll slowly. “Bring the gold and bring the gem, we will keep bride-state in them, While we keep the foe at bay. XXXVIII “On your arms I loose mine hair; comb it smooth and crown it fair” Toll slowly. “I would look in purple pall from this lattice down the wall, And throw scorn to one that's there!” XXXIX Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west— Toll slowly. On the tower the castle's lord leant in silence on his sword, With an anguish in his breast. XL With a spirit-laden weight did he lean down passionate: Toll slowly. They have almost sapped the wall,—they will enter therewithal With no knocking at the gate. XLI Then the sword he leant upon, shivered, snapped upon the stone— Toll slowly. “Sword,” he thought, with inward laugh, “ill thou servest for a staff When thy nobler use is done! XLII “Sword, thy nobler use is done! tower is lost, and shame begun!”— Toll slowly. “If we met them in the breach, hilt to hilt or speech to speech, We should die there, each for one. XLIII “If we met them at the wall, we should singly, vainly fall”— Toll slowly. “But if I die here alone,—then I die who am but one, And die nobly for them all. XLIV “Five true friends lie for my sake in the moat and in the brake”— Toll slowly. “Thirteen warriors lie at rest with a black wound in the breast, And not one of these will wake. XLV “So, no more of this shall be! heart-blood weighs too heavily”— Toll slowly. “And I could not sleep in grave, with the faithful and the brave Heaped around and over me. XLVI “Since young Clare a mother hath, and young Ralph a plighted faith”— Toll slowly. “Since my pale young sister's cheeks blush like rose when Ronald speaks, Albeit never a word she saith— XLVII “These shall never die for me: life-blood falls too heavily”: Toll slowly. “And if I die here apart, o'er my dead and silent heart They shall pass out safe and free. XLVIII “When the foe hath heard it said—‘Death holds Guy of Linteged’”— Toll slowly. “That new corse new peace shall bring, and a blessèd, blessèd thing Shall the stone be at its head. XLIX “Then my friends shall pass out free, and shall bear my memory”— Toll slowly. “Then my foes shall sleek their pride, soothing fair my widowed bride Whose sole sin was love of me: L “With their words all smooth and sweet, they will front her and entreat”— Toll slowly. “And their purple pall will spread underneath her fainting head While her tears drop over it. LI “She will weep her woman's tears, she will pray her woman's prayers”— Toll slowly. “But her heart is young in pain, and her hopes will spring again By the suntime of her years. LII “Ah, sweet May! ah, sweetest grief!—once I vowed thee my belief”— Toll slowly— “That thy name expressed thy sweetness,—May of poets, in completeness! Now my May-day seemeth brief.” LIII All these silent thoughts did swim o'er his eyes grown strange and dim— Toll slowly. Till his true men, in the place, wished they stood there face to face With the foe instead of him. LIV “One last oath, my friends that wear faithful hearts to do and dare!” Toll slowly. “Tower must fall and bride be lost—swear me service worth the cost!” Bold they stood around to swear. LV “Each man clasp my hand and swear by the deed we failed in there”— Toll slowly. “Not for vengeance, not for right, will ye strike one blow to-night!” Pale they stood around to swear. LVI “One last boon, young Ralph and Clare! faithful hearts to do and dare!” Toll slowly. “Bring that steed up from his stall, which she kissed before you all: Guide him up the turret-stair. LVII “Ye shall harness him aright, and lead upward to this height:” Toll slowly. “Once in love and twice in war hath he borne me strong and far: He shall bear me far to-night.” LVIII Then his men looked to and fro, when they heard him speaking so— Toll slowly. “'Las! the noble heart,” they thought, “he in sooth is grief-distraught: Would we stood here with the foe!” LIX But a fire flashed from his eye, 'twixt their thought and their reply— Toll slowly. “Have ye so much time to waste? We who ride here, must ride fast As we wish our foes to fly.” LX They have fetched the steed with care, in the harness he did wear— Toll slowly. Past the court and through the doors, across the rushes of the floors, But they goad him up the stair. LXI Then from out her bower chambère did the Duchess May repair: Toll slowly. “Tell me now what is your need,” said the lady, “of this steed, That ye goad him up the stair?” LXII Calm she stood; unbodkined through, fell her dark hair to her shoe: Toll slowly. And the smile upon her face, ere she left the tiring-glass, Had not time enough to go. LXIII “Get thee back, sweet Duchess May! hope is gone like yesterday” Toll slowly. “One half-hour completes the breach; and thy lord grows wild of speech— Get thee in, sweet lady, and pray! LXIV “In the east tower, high'st of all, loud he cries for steed from stall”: Toll slowly. “‘He would ride as far,’ quoth he, ‘as for love and victory, Though he rides the castle-wall!’ LXV “And we fetch the steed from stall, up where never a hoof did fall”— Toll slowly. “Wifely prayer meets deathly need: may the sweet Heavens hear thee plead If he rides the castle-wall!” LXVI Low she dropt her head, and lower, till her hair coiled on the floor— Toll slowly. And tear after tear you heard fall distinct as any word Which you might be listening for. LXVII “Get thee in, thou soft ladye! here is never a place for thee!” Toll slowly. “Braid thine hair and clasp thy gown, that thy beauty in its moan May find grace with Leigh of Leigh.” LXVIII She stood up in bitter case, with a pale yet steady face: Toll slowly. Like a statue thunderstruck, which, though quivering, seems to look Right against the thunder-place. LXIX And her foot trod in, with pride, her own tears i' the stone beside— Toll slowly. “Go to, faithful friends, go to! judge no more what ladies do, No, nor how their lords may ride!” LXX Then the good steed's rein she took, and his neck did kiss and stroke: Toll slowly. Soft he neighed to answer her, and then followed up the stair For the love of her sweet look: LXXI Oh, and steeply, steeply wound up the narrow stair around— Toll slowly. Oh, and closely, closely speeding, step by step beside her treading Did he follow, meek as hound. LXXII On the east tower, high'st of all,—there, where never a hoof did fall— Toll slowly. Out they swept, a vision steady, noble steed and lovely lady, Calm as if in bower or stall. LXXIII Down she knelt at her lord's knee, and she looked up silently— Toll slowly. And he kissed her twice and thrice, for that look within her eyes Which he could not bear to see. LXXIV Quoth he, “Get thee from this strife, and the sweet saints bless thy life!” Toll slowly. “In this hour I stand in need of my noble red-roan steed, But no more of my noble wife.” LXXV Quoth she, “Meekly have I done all thy biddings under sun”: Toll slowly. “But by all my womanhood, which is proved so, true and good, I will never do this one. LXXVI “Now by womanhood's degree and by wifehood's verity”— Toll slowly. “In this hour if thou hast need of thy noble red-roan steed, Thou hast also need of me. LXXVII “By this golden ring ye see on this lifted hand pardiè”— Toll slowly. “If, this hour, on castle-wall can be room for steed from stall, Shall be also room for me. LXXVIII “So the sweet saints with me be,” (did she utter solemnly)— Toll slowly. “If a man, this eventide, on this castle-wall will ride, He shall ride the same with me.” LXXIX Oh, he sprang up in the selle and he laughed out bitter-well— Toll slowly. “Wouldst thou ride among the leaves, as we used on other eves, To hear chime a vesper-bell?” LXXX She clung closer to his knee—“Ay, beneath the cypress-tree!” Toll slowly. “Mock me not, for otherwhere than along the greenwood fair Have I ridden fast with thee. LXXXI “Fast I rode with new-made vows from my angry kinsman's house”: Toll slowly. “What, and would you men should reck that I dared more for love's sake As a bride than as a spouse? LXXXII “What, and would you it should fall, as a proverb, before all”— Toll slowly. “That a bride may keep your side while through castle-gate you ride, Yet eschew the castle-wall?” LXXXIII Ho! the breach yawns into ruin and roars up against her suing— Toll slowly. With the inarticulate din and the dreadful falling in— Shrieks of doing and undoing! LXXXIV Twice he wrung her hands in twain, but the small hands closed again. Toll slowly. Back he reined the steed—back, back! but she trailed along his track With a frantic clasp and strain. LXXXV Evermore the foemen pour through the crash of window and door— Toll slowly. And the shouts of Leigh and Leigh, and the shrieks of “kill!” and “flee!” Strike up clear amid the roar. LXXXVI Thrice he wrung her hands in twain, but they closed and clung again— Toll slowly. While she clung, as one, withstood, clasps a Christ upon the rood, In a spasm of deathly pain. LXXXVII She clung wild and she clung mute with her shuddering lips half-shut: Toll slowly. Her head fallen as half in swound, hair and knee swept on the ground, She clung wild to stirrup and foot. LXXXVIII Back he reined his steed back-thrown on the slippery coping-stone: Toll slowly. Back the iron hoofs did grind on the battlement behind Whence a hundred feet went down: LXXXIX And his heel did press and goad on the quivering flank bestrode— Toll slowly. “Friends and brothers, save my wife! Pardon, sweet, in change for life,— But I ride alone to God.” XC Straight as if the Holy name had upbreathed her like a flame— Toll slowly. She upsprang, she rose upright, in his selle she sate in sight, By her love she overcame. XCI And her head was on his breast where she smiled as one at rest— Toll slowly. “Ring,” she cried, “O vesper-bell in the beechwood's old chapelle— But the passing-bell rings best!” XCII They have caught out at the rein which Sir Guy threw loose—in vain— Toll slowly. For the horse in stark despair, with his front hoofs poised in air, On the last verge rears amain. XCIII Now he hangs, he rocks between, and his nostrils curdle in— Toll slowly. Now he shivers head and hoof and the flakes of foam fall off, And his face grows fierce and thin: XCIV And a look of human woe from his staring eyes did go: Toll slowly. And a sharp cry uttered he, in a foretold agony Of the headlong death below,— XCV And, “Ring, ring, thou passing-bell,” still she cried, “i' the old chapelle!” Toll slowly. Then, back-toppling, crashing back—a dead weight flung out to wrack, Horse and riders overfell. I Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west— Toll slowly. And I read this ancient Rhyme, in the churchyard, while the chime Slowly tolled for one at rest. II The abeles moved in the sun, and the river smooth did run— Toll slowly. And the ancient Rhyme rang strange, with its passion and its change, Here, where all done lay undone. III And beneath a willow tree I a little grave did see— Toll slowly— Where was graved—Here, undefiled, lieth Maud, a three-year child, Eighteen hundred forty-three. IV Then, O spirits, did I say, ye who rode so fast that day— Toll slowly. Did star-wheels and angel wings with their holy winnowings Keep beside you all the way? V Though in passion ye would dash, with a blind and heavy crash— Toll slowly— Up against the thick-bossed shield of God's judgment in the field,— Though your heart and brain were rash,— VI Now, your will is all unwilled; now, your pulses are all stilled: Toll slowly. Now, ye lie as meek and mild (whereso laid) as Maud the child Whose small grave was lately filled. VII Beating heart and burning brow, ye are very patient now— Toll slowly. And the children might be bold to pluck the kingcups from your mould Ere a month had let them grow. VIII And you let the goldfinch sing in the alder near in spring— Toll slowly. Let her build her nest and sit all the three weeks out on it, Murmuring not at anything. IX In your patience ye are strong, cold and heat ye take not wrong— Toll slowly. When the trumpet of the angel blows eternity's evangel, Time will seem to you not long. X Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west— Toll slowly. And I said in underbreath,—All our life is mixed with death, And who knoweth which is best? XI Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west— Toll slowly. And I smiled to think God's greatness flowed around our incompleteness,— Round our restlessness, His rest. THE LADY'S “YES.” I “Yes,” I answered you last night; “No,” this morning, sir, I say: Colours seen by candle-light Will not look the same by day. II When the viols played their best, Lamps above and laughs below, Love me sounded like a jest, Fit for yes or fit for no. III Call me false or call me free, Vow, whatever light may shine,— No man on your face shall see Any grief for change on mine. IV Yet the sin is on us both; Time to dance is not to woo; Wooing light makes fickle troth, Scorn of me recoils on you. V Learn to win a lady's faith Nobly, as the thing is high, Bravely, as for life and death, With a loyal gravity. VI Lead her from the festive boards, Point her to the starry skies; Guard her, by your truthful words, Pure from courtship's flatteries. VII By your truth she shall be true, Ever true, as wives of yore; And her yes, once said to you, Shall be Yes for evermore. THE POET AND THE BIRD. A FABLE. I Said a people to a poet—“Go out from among us straightway! While we are thinking earthly things, thou singest of divine: There's a little fair brown nightingale who, sitting in the gateway, Makes fitter music to our ear than any song of thine!” II The poet went out weeping; the nightingale ceased chanting: “Now, wherefore, O thou nightingale, is all thy sweetness done?” —“I cannot sing my earthly things, the heavenly poet wanting, Whose highest harmony includes the lowest under sun.” III The poet went out weeping, and died abroad, bereft there; The bird flew to his grave and died amid a thousand wails: And when I last came by the place, I swear the music left there Was only of the poet's song, and not the nightingale's. THE LOST BOWER. I In the pleasant orchard-closes, “God bless all our gains,” say we, But “May God bless all our losses” Better suits with our degree. Listen, gentle—ay, and simple! listen, children on the knee! II Green the land is where my daily Steps in jocund childhood played, Dimpled close with hill and valley, Dappled very close with shade: Summer-snow of apple-blossoms running up from glade to glade. III There is one hill I see nearer In my vision of the rest; And a little wood seems clearer As it climbeth from the west, Sideway from the tree-locked valley, to the airy upland crest. IV Small the wood is, green with hazels, And, completing the ascent, Where the wind blows and sun dazzles, Thrills in leafy tremblement, Like a heart that after climbing beateth quickly through content. V Not a step the wood advances O'er the open hill-top's bound; There, in green arrest, the branches See their image on the ground: You may walk beneath them smiling, glad with sight and glad with sound. VI For you hearken on your right hand, How the birds do leap and call In the greenwood, out of sight and Out of reach and fear of all; And the squirrels crack the filberts through their cheerful madrigal. VII On your left, the sheep are cropping The slant grass and daisies pale, And five apple-trees stand dropping Separate shadows toward the vale Over which, in choral silence, the hills look you their “All hail!” VIII Far out, kindled by each other, Shining hills on hills arise, Close as brother leans to brother When they press beneath the eyes Of some father praying blessings from the gifts of paradise. IX While beyond, above them mounted, And above their woods alsò, Malvern hills, for mountains counted Not unduly, loom a-row— Keepers of Piers Plowman's visions through the sunshine and the snow. The Malvern Hills of Worcestershire are the scene of Langland's Visions, and thus present the earliest classic ground of English poetry. X Yet, in childhood, little prized I That fair walk and far survey; 'Twas a straight walk unadvised by The least mischief worth a nay; Up and down—as dull as grammar on the eve of holiday. XI But the wood, all close and clenching Bough in bough and root in root,— No more sky (for overbranching) At your head than at your foot,— Oh, the wood drew me within it by a glamour past dispute! XII Few and broken paths showed through it, Where the sheep had tried to run,— Forced with snowy wool to strew it Round the thickets, when anon They, with silly thorn-pricked noses, bleated back into the sun. XIII But my childish heart beat stronger Than those thickets dared to grow: I could pierce them! I could longer Travel on, methought, than so: Sheep for sheep-paths! braver children climb and creep where they would go. XIV And the poets wander, said I, Over places all as rude: Bold Rinaldo's lovely lady Sat to meet him in a wood: Rosalinda, like a fountain, laughed out pure with solitude. XV And if Chaucer had not travelled Through a forest by a well, He had never dreamt nor marvelled At those ladies fair and fell Who lived smiling without loving in their island-citadel. XVI Thus I thought of the old singers And took courage from their song, Till my little struggling fingers Tore asunder gyve and thong Of the brambles which entrapped me, and the barrier branches strong. XVII On a day, such pastime keeping, With a fawn's heart debonair, Under-crawling, overleaping Thorns that prick and boughs that bear, I stood suddenly astonied—I was gladdened unaware. XVIII From the place I stood in, floated Back the covert dim and close, And the open ground was coated Carpet-smooth with grass and moss, And the blue-bell's purple presence signed it worthily across. XIX Here a linden-tree stood, bright'ning All adown its silver rind; For as some trees draw the lightning, So this tree, unto my mind, Drew to earth the blessèd sunshine from the sky where it was shrined. XX Tall the linden-tree, and near it An old hawthorn also grew; And wood-ivy like a spirit Hovered dimly round the two, Shaping thence that bower of beauty which I sing of thus to you. XXI 'Twas a bower for garden fitter Than for any woodland wide: Though a fresh and dewy glitter Struck it through from side to side, Shaped and shaven was the freshness, as by garden-cunning plied. XXII Oh, a lady might have come there, Hooded fairly like her hawk, With a book or lute in summer, And a hope of sweeter talk,— Listening less to her own music than for footsteps on the walk! XXIII But that bower appeared a marvel In the wildness of the place; With such seeming art and travail, Finely fixed and fitted was Leaf to leaf, the dark-green ivy, to the summit from the base. XXIV And the ivy veined and glossy Was enwrought with eglantine; And the wild hop fibred closely, And the large-leaved columbine, Arch of door and window-mullion, did right sylvanly entwine. XXV Rose-trees either side the door were Growing lithe and growing tall, Each one set a summer warder For the keeping of the hall,— With a red rose and a white rose, leaning, nodding at the wall. XXVI As I entered, mosses hushing Stole all noises from my foot; And a green elastic cushion, Clasped within the linden's root, Took me in a chair of silence very rare and absolute. XXVII All the floor was paved with glory, Greenly, silently inlaid (Through quick motions made before me) With fair counterparts in shade Of the fair serrated ivy-leaves which slanted overhead. XXVIII “Is such pavement in a palace?” So I questioned in my thought: The sun, shining through the chalice Of the red rose hung without, Threw within a red libation, like an answer to my doubt. XXIX At the same time, on the linen Of my childish lap there fell Two white may-leaves, downward winning Through the ceiling's miracle, From a blossom, like an angel, out of sight yet blessing well. XXX Down to floor and up to ceiling Quick I turned my childish face, With an innocent appealing For the secret of the place To the trees, which surely knew it in partaking of the grace. XXXI Where's no foot of human creature How could reach a human hand? And if this be work of Nature, Why has Nature turned so bland, Breaking off from other wild-work? It was hard to understand. XXXII Was she weary of rough-doing, Of the bramble and the thorn? Did she pause in tender rueing Here of all her sylvan scorn? Or in mock of Art's deceiving was the sudden mildness worn? XXXIII Or could this same bower (I fancied) Be the work of Dryad strong, Who, surviving all that chancèd In the world's old pagan wrong, Lay hid, feeding in the woodland on the last true poet's song? XXXIV Or was this the house of fairies, Left, because of the rough ways, Unassoiled by Ave Marys Which the passing pilgrim prays, And beyond St. Catherine's chiming on the blessèd Sabbath days? XXXV So, young muser, I sat listening To my fancy's wildest word: On a sudden, through the glistening Leaves around, a little stirred, Came a sound, a sense of music which was rather felt than heard. XXXVI Softly, finely, it inwound me; From the world it shut me in,— Like a fountain, falling round me, Which with silver waters thin Clips a little water Naiad sitting smilingly within. XXXVII Whence the music came, who knoweth? I know nothing: but indeed Pan or Faunus never bloweth So much sweetness from a reed Which has sucked the milk of waters at the oldest river-head. XXXVIII Never lark the sun can waken With such sweetness! when the lark, The high planets overtaking In the half-evanished Dark, Casts his singing to their singing, like an arrow to the mark. XXXIX Never nightingale so singeth: Oh, she leans on thorny tree And her poet-song she flingeth Over pain to victory! Yet she never sings such music,—or she sings it not to me. XL Never blackbirds, never thrushes Nor small finches sing as sweet, When the sun strikes through the bushes To their crimson clinging feet, And their pretty eyes look sideways to the summer heavens complete. XLI If it were a bird, it seemèd Most like Chaucer's, which, in sooth, He of green and azure dreamèd, While it sat in spirit-ruth On that bier of a crowned lady, singing nigh her silent mouth. XLII If it were a bird?—ah, sceptic, Give me “yea” or give me “nay”— Though my soul were nympholeptic As I heard that virèlay, You may stoop your pride to pardon, for my sin is far away! XLIII I rose up in exaltation And an inward trembling heat, And (it seemed) in geste of passion Dropped the music to my feet Like a garment rustling downwards—such a silence followed it! XLIV Heart and head beat through the quiet Full and heavily, though slower: In the song, I think, and by it, Mystic Presences of power Had up-snatched me to the Timeless, then returned me to the Hour. XLV In a child-abstraction lifted, Straightway from the bower I past, Foot and soul being dimly drifted Through the greenwood, till, at last, In the hill-top's open sunshine I all consciously was cast. XLVI Face to face with the true mountains I stood silently and still, Drawing strength from fancy's dauntings, From the air about the hill, And from Nature's open mercies and most debonair goodwill. XLVII Oh, the golden-hearted daisies Witnessed there, before my youth, To the truth of things, with praises Of the beauty of the truth; And I woke to Nature's real, laughing joyfully for both. XLVIII And I said within me, laughing, I have found a bower to-day, A green lusus, fashioned half in Chance and half in Nature's play, And a little bird sings nigh it, I will never more missay. XLIX Henceforth, I will be the fairy Of this bower not built by one; I will go there, sad or merry, With each morning's benison, And the bird shall be my harper in the dreamhall I have won. L So I said. But the next morning, (—Child, look up into my face— 'Ware, oh sceptic, of your scorning! This is truth in its pure grace!) The next morning, all had vanished, or my wandering missed the place. LI Bring an oath most sylvan-holy, And upon it swear me true— By the wind-bells swinging slowly Their mute curfews in the dew, By the advent of the snowdrop, by the rosemary and rue,— LII I affirm by all or any, Let the cause be charm or chance, That my wandering searches many Missed the bower of my romance— That I nevermore upon it turned my mortal countenance. LIII I affirm that, since I lost it, Never bower has seemed so fair; Never garden-creeper crossed it With so deft and brave an air, Never bird sung in the summer, as I saw and heard them there. LIV Day by day, with new desire, Toward my wood I ran in faith, Under leaf and over brier, Through the thickets, out of breath; Like the prince who rescued Beauty from the sleep as long as death. LV But his sword of mettle clashèd, And his arm smote strong, I ween, And her dreaming spirit flashèd Through her body's fair white screen, And the light thereof might guide him up the cedar alleys green: LVI But for me, I saw no splendour— All my sword was my child-heart; And the wood refused surrender Of that bower it held apart, Safe as Œdipus's grave-place 'mid Colonos' olives swart. LVII As Aladdin sought the basements His fair palace rose upon, And the four-and-twenty casements Which gave answers to the sun; So, in 'wilderment of gazing, I looked up and I looked down. LVIII Years have vanished since, as wholly As the little bower did then; And you call it tender folly That such thoughts should come again? Ah, I cannot change this sighing for your smiling, brother men! LIX For this loss it did prefigure Other loss of better good, When my soul, in spirit-vigour And in ripened womanhood, Fell from visions of more beauty than an arbour in a wood. LX I have lost—oh, many a pleasure, Many a hope and many a power— Studious health and merry leisure, The first dew on the first flower! But the first of all my losses was the losing of the bower. LXI I have lost the dream of Doing, And the other dream of Done, The first spring in the pursuing, The first pride in the Begun,— First recoil from incompletion, in the face of what is won— LXII Exaltations in the far light Where some cottage only is; Mild dejections in the starlight, Which the sadder-hearted miss; And the child-cheek blushing scarlet for the very shame of bliss. LXIII I have lost the sound child-sleeping Which the thunder could not break; Something too of the strong leaping Of the staglike heart awake, Which the pale is low for keeping in the road it ought to take. LXIV Some respect to social fictions Has been also lost by me; And some generous genuflexions, Which my spirit offered free To the pleasant old conventions of our false humanity. LXV All my losses did I tell you, Ye perchance would look away;— Ye would answer me, “Farewell! you Make sad company to-day, And your tears are falling faster than the bitter words you say.” LXVI For God placed me like a dial In the open ground with power, And my heart had for its trial All the sun and all the shower: And I suffered many losses,—and my first was of the bower. LXVII Laugh you? If that loss of mine be Of no heavy-seeming weight— When the cone falls from the pine-tree, The young children laugh thereat; Yet the wind that struck it, riseth, and the tempest shall be great. LXVIII One who knew me in my childhood In the glamour and the game, Looking on me long and mild, would Never know me for the same. Come, unchanging recollections, where those changes overcame! LXIX By this couch I weakly lie on, While I count my memories,— Through the fingers which, still sighing, I press closely on mine eyes,— Clear as once beneath the sunshine, I behold the bower arise. LXX Springs the linden-tree as greenly, Stroked with light adown its rind; And the ivy-leaves serenely Each in either intertwined; And the rose-trees at the doorway, they have neither grown nor pined. LXXI From those overblown faint roses Not a leaf appeareth shed, And that little bud discloses Not a thorn's-breadth more of red, For the winters and the summers which have passed me overhead. LXXII And that music overfloweth, Sudden sweet, the sylvan eaves: Thrush or nightingale—who knoweth? Fay or Faunus—who believes? But my heart still trembles in me to the trembling of the leaves. LXXIII Is the bower lost, then? who sayeth That the bower indeed is lost? Hark! my spirit in it prayeth Through the sunshine and the frost,— And the prayer preserves it greenly, to the last and uttermost. LXXIV Till another open for me In God's Eden-land unknown, With an angel at the doorway, White with gazing at His Throne; And a saint's voice in the palm-trees, singing—“All is lost . . . and won!” A CHILD ASLEEP. I How he sleepeth, having drunken Weary childhood's mandragore! From its pretty eyes have sunken Pleasures to make room for more; Sleeping near the withered nosegay which he pulled the day before. II Nosegays! leave them for the waking; Throw them earthward where they grew; Dim are such beside the breaking Amaranths he looks unto: Folded eyes see brighter colours than the open ever do. III Heaven-flowers, rayed by shadows golden From the palms they sprang beneath, Now perhaps divinely holden, Swing against him in a wreath: We may think so from the quickening of his bloom and of his breath. IV Vision unto vision calleth While the young child dreameth on: Fair, O dreamer, thee befalleth With the glory thou hast won! Darker wast thou in the garden yestermorn by summer sun. V We should see the spirits ringing Round thee, were the clouds away: 'Tis the child-heart draws them, singing In the silent-seeming clay— Singing! stars that seem the mutest go in music all the way. VI As the moths around a taper, As the bees around a rose, As the gnats around a vapour, So the spirits group and close Round about a holy childhood as if drinking its repose. VII Shapes of brightness overlean thee, Flash their diadems of youth On the ringlets which half screen thee, While thou smilest . . . not in sooth Thy smile, but the overfair one, dropt from some etherial mouth. VIII Haply it is angels' duty, During slumber, shade by shade To fine down this childish beauty To the thing it must be made Ere the world shall bring it praises, or the tomb shall see it fade. IX Softly, softly! make no noises! Now he lieth dead and dumb; Now he hears the angels' voices Folding silence in the room: Now he muses deep the meaning of the Heaven-words as they come. X Speak not! he is consecrated; Breathe no breath across his eyes: Lifted up and separated On the hand of God he lies In a sweetness beyond touching, held in cloistral sanctities. XI Could ye bless him, father—mother, Bless the dimple in his cheek? Dare ye look at one another And the benediction speak? Would ye not break out in weeping and confess yourselves too weak? XII He is harmless, ye are sinful; Ye are troubled, he at ease; From his slumber virtue winful Floweth outward with increase. Dare not bless him! but be blessèd by his peace, and go in peace. THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN. “???, ???, ?? ???????????? ?? ???????, ??????” —Medea. I Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers, Ere the sorrow comes with years? They are leaning their young heads against their mothers, And that cannot stop their tears. The young lambs are bleating in the meadows, The young birds are chirping in the nest, The young fawns are playing with the shadows, The young flowers are blowing toward the west— But the young, young children, O my brothers, They are weeping bitterly! They are weeping in the playtime of the others, In the country of the free. II Do you question the young children in the sorrow Why their tears are falling so? The old man may weep for his to-morrow Which is lost in Long Ago; The old tree is leafless in the forest, The old year is ending in the frost, The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest, The old hope is hardest to be lost: But the young, young children, O my brothers, Do you ask them why they stand Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers, In our happy Fatherland? III They look up with their pale and sunken faces, And their looks are sad to see, For the man's hoary anguish draws and presses Down the cheeks of infancy; “Your old earth,” they say, “is very dreary, Our young feet,” they say, “are very weak; Few paces have we taken, yet are weary— Our grave-rest is very far to seek: Ask the aged why they weep, and not the children, For the outside earth is cold, And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering, And the graves are for the old. IV “True,” say the children, “it may happen That we die before our time: Little Alice died last year, her grave is shapen Like a snowball, in the rime. We looked into the pit prepared to take her: Was no room for any work in the close clay! From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her, Crying, ‘Get up, little Alice! it is day.’ If you listen by that grave, in sun and shower, With your ear down, little Alice never cries; Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her, For the smile has time for growing in her eyes: And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in The shroud by the kirk-chime. It is good when it happens,” say the children, “That we die before our time.” V Alas, alas, the children! they are seeking Death in life, as best to have: They are binding up their hearts away from breaking, With a cerement from the grave. Go out, children, from the mine and from the city, Sing out, children, as the little thrushes do; Pluck your handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty, Laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through! But they answer, “Are your cowslips of the meadows Like our weeds anear the mine? Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows, From your pleasures fair and fine! VI “For oh,” say the children, “we are weary, And we cannot run or leap; If we cared for any meadows, it were merely To drop down in them and sleep. Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping, We fall upon our faces, trying to go; And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping The reddest flower would look as pale as snow. For, all day, we drag our burden tiring Through the coal-dark, underground; Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron In the factories, round and round. VII “For all day the wheels are droning, turning; Their wind comes in our faces, Till our hearts turn, our heads with pulses burning, And the walls turn in their places: Turns the sky in the high window, blank and reeling, Turns the long light that drops adown the wall, Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling: All are turning, all the day, and we with all. And all day the iron wheels are droning, And sometimes we could pray, ‘O ye wheels’ (breaking out in a mad moaning), ‘Stop! be silent for to-day!’” VIII Ay, be silent! Let them hear each other breathing For a moment, mouth to mouth! Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing Of their tender human youth! Let them feel that this cold metallic motion Is not all the life God fashions or reveals: Let them prove their living souls against the notion That they live in you, or under you, O wheels! Still, all day, the iron wheels go onward, Grinding life down from its mark; And the children's souls, which God is calling sunward, Spin on blindly in the dark. IX Now tell the poor young children, O my brothers, To look up to Him and pray; So the blessed One who blesseth all the others, Will bless them another day. They answer, “Who is God that He should hear us, While the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred? When we sob aloud, the human creatures near us Pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word. And we hear not (for the wheels in their resounding) Strangers speaking at the door: Is it likely God, with angels singing round Him, Hears our weeping any more? X “Two words, indeed, of praying we remember, And at midnight's hour of harm, ‘Our Father,’ looking upward in the chamber, We say softly for a charm. A fact rendered pathetically historical by Mr. Horne's report of his Commission. The name of the poet of “Orion” and “Cosmo de' Medici” has, however, a change of associations, and comes in time to remind me that we have some noble poetic heat of literature still,—however open to the reproach of being somewhat gelid in our humanity. —1844. We know no other words except ‘Our Father,’ And we think that, in some pause of angels' song, God may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather, And hold both within His right hand which is strong. ‘Our Father!’ If He heard us, He would surely (For they call Him good and mild) Answer, smiling down the steep world very purely, ‘Come and rest with me, my child.’ XI “But, no!” say the children, weeping faster, “He is speechless as a stone: And they tell us, of His image is the master Who commands us to work on. Go to!” say the children,—“up in Heaven, Dark, wheel-like, turning clouds are all we find. Do not mock us; grief has made us unbelieving: We look up for God, but tears have made us blind.” Do you hear the children weeping and disproving, O my brothers, what ye preach? For God's possible is taught by His world's loving, And the children doubt of each. XII And well may the children weep before you! They are weary ere they run; They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory Which is brighter than the sun. They know the grief of man, without its wisdom; They sink in man's despair, without its calm; Are slaves, without the liberty in Christdom, Are martyrs, by the pang without the palm: Are worn as if with age, yet unretrievingly The harvest of its memories cannot reap,— Are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly. Let them weep! let them weep! XIII They look up with their pale and sunken faces, And their look is dread to see, For they mind you of their angels in high places, With eyes turned on Deity. “How long,” they say, “how long, O cruel nation, Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart,— Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation, And tread onward to your throne amid the mart? Our blood splashes upward, O gold-heaper, And your purple shows your path! But the child's sob in the silence curses deeper Than the strong man in his wrath.” CROWNED AND WEDDED. I. When last before her people's face her own fair face she bent, Within the meek projection of that shade she was content To erase the child-smile from her lips, which seemed as if it might Be still kept holy from the world to childhood still in sight— To erase it with a solemn vow, a princely vow—to rule; A priestly vow—to rule by grace of God the pitiful; A very godlike vow—to rule in right and righteousness And with the law and for the land—so God the vower bless! II. The minster was alight that day, but not with fire, I ween, And long-drawn glitterings swept adown that mighty aislèd scene; The priests stood stolèd in their pomp, the sworded chiefs in theirs, And so, the collared knights, and so, the civil ministers, And so, the waiting lords and dames, and little pages best At holding trains, and legates so, from countries east and west; So, alien princes, native peers, and highborn ladies bright, Along whose brows the Queen's, now crowned, flashed coronets to light; And so, the people at the gates with priestly hands on high Which bring the first anointing to all legal majesty; And so the Dead, who lie in rows beneath the minster floor, There verily an awful state maintaining evermore: The statesman whose clean palm will kiss no bribe whate'er it be, The courtier who for no fair queen will rise up to his knee, The court-dame who for no court-tire will leave her shroud behind, The laureate who no courtlier rhyme than “dust to dust” can find, The kings and queens who having made that vow and worn that crown, Descended unto lower thrones and darker, deep adown: Dieu et mon droit—what is't to them? what meaning can it have?— The King of kings, the right of death—God's judgment and the grave. And when betwixt the quick and dead the young fair queen had vowed, The living shouted “May she live! Victoria, live!” aloud: And as the loyal shouts went up, true spirits prayed between, “The blessings happy monarchs have be thine, O crownèd queen!” III. But now before her people's face she bendeth hers anew, And calls them, while she vows, to be her witness thereunto. She vowed to rule, and in that oath her childhood put away: She doth maintain her womanhood, in vowing love to-day. O lovely lady! let her vow! such lips become such vows, And fairer goeth bridal wreath than crown with vernal brows. O lovely lady! let her vow! yea, let her vow to love! And though she be no less a queen, with purples hung above, The pageant of a court behind, the royal kin around, And woven gold to catch her looks turned maidenly to ground, Yet may the bride-veil hide from her a little of that state, While loving hopes for retinues about her sweetness wait. She vows to love who vowed to rule—(the chosen at her side) Let none say, God preserve the queen! but rather, Bless the bride! None blow the trump, none bend the knee, none violate the dream Wherein no monarch but a wife she to herself may seem. Or if ye say, Preserve the queen! oh, breathe it inward low— She is a woman, and beloved! and 'tis enough but so. Count it enough, thou noble prince who tak'st her by the hand And claimest for thy lady-love our lady of the land! And since, Prince Albert, men have called thy spirit high and rare, And true to truth and brave for truth as some at Augsburg were, We charge thee by thy lofty thoughts and by thy poet-mind Which not by glory and degree takes measure of mankind, Esteem that wedded hand less dear for sceptre than for ring, And hold her uncrowned womanhood to be the royal thing. IV. And now, upon our queen's last vow what blessings shall we pray? None straitened to a shallow crown will suit our lips to-day: Behold, they must be free as love, they must be broad as free, Even to the borders of heaven's light and earth's humanity. Long live she!—send up loyal shouts, and true hearts pray between,— “The blessings happy peasants have, be thine, O crownèd queen!” CROWNED AND BURIED. I Napoleon!—years ago, and that great word Compàct of human breath in hate and dread And exultation, skied us overhead— An atmosphere whose lightning was the sword Scathing the cedars of the world,—drawn down In burnings, by the metal of a crown. II Napoleon!—nations, while they cursed that name, Shook at their own curse; and while others bore Its sound, as of a trumpet, on before, Brass-fronted legions justified its fame; And dying men on trampled battle-sods Near their last silence uttered it for God's. III Napoleon!—sages, with high foreheads drooped, Did use it for a problem; children small Leapt up to greet it, as at manhood's call; Priests blessed it from their altars overstooped By meek-eyed Christs; and widows with a moan Spake it, when questioned why they sat alone. IV That name consumed the silence of the snows In Alpine keeping, holy and cloud-hid; The mimic eagles dared what Nature's did, And over-rushed her mountainous repose In search of eyries: and the Egyptian river Mingled the same word with its grand “For ever.” V That name was shouted near the pyramidal Nilotic tombs, whose mummied habitants, Packed to humanity's significance, Motioned it back with stillness,—shouts as idle As hireling artists' work of myrrh and spice Which swathed last glories round the Ptolemies. VI The world's face changed to hear it; kingly men Came down in chidden babes' bewilderment From autocratic places, each content With sprinkled ashes for anointing: then The people laughed or wondered for the nonce, To see one throne a composite of thrones. VII Napoleon!—even the torrid vastitude Of India felt in throbbings of the air That name which scattered by disastrous blare All Europe's bound-lines,—drawn afresh in blood. Napoleon!—from the Russias west to Spain: And Austria trembled till ye heard her chain. VIII And Germany was 'ware; and Italy Oblivious of old fames—her laurel-locked, High-ghosted Cæsars passing uninvoked— Did crumble her own ruins with her knee, To serve a newer: ay! but Frenchmen cast A future from them nobler than their past: IX For verily though France augustly rose With that raised name, and did assume by such The purple of the world, none gave so much As she in purchase—to speak plain, in loss— Whose hands, toward freedom stretched, dropped paralysed To wield a sword or fit an undersized X King's crown to a great man's head. And though along Her Paris' streets did float on frequent streams Of triumph, pictured or emmarbled dreams Dreamt right by genius in a world gone wrong,— No dream of all so won was fair to see As the lost vision of her liberty. XI Napoleon!—'twas a high name lifted high: It met at last God's thunder sent to clear Our compassing and covering atmosphere And open a clear sight beyond the sky Of supreme empire; this of earth's was done— And kings crept out again to feel the sun. XII The kings crept out—the peoples sat at home, And finding the long-invocated peace (A pall embroidered with worn images Of rights divine) too scant to cover doom Such as they suffered, cursed the corn that grew Rankly, to bitter bread, on Waterloo. XIII A deep gloom centred in the deep repose; The nations stood up mute to count their dead: And he who owned the Name which vibrated Through silence,—trusting to his noblest foes When earth was all too grey for chivalry, Died of their mercies 'mid the desert sea. XIV O wild Saint Helen! very still she kept him, With a green willow for all pyramid, Which stirred a little if the low wind did, A little more if pilgrims overwept him, Disparting the lithe boughs to see the clay Which seemed to cover his for judgment-day. XV Nay, not so long! France kept her old affection As deeply as the sepulchre the corse; Until, dilated by such love's remorse To a new angel of the resurrection, She cried “Behold, thou England! I would have The dead, whereof thou wottest, from that grave.” XVI And England answered in the courtesy Which, ancient foes turned lovers, may befit: “Take back thy dead! and when thou buriest it, Throw in all former strifes 'twixt thee and me.” Amen, mine England! 'tis a courteous claim: But ask a little room too—for thy shame! XVII Because it was not well, it was not well, Nor tuneful with thy lofty-chanted part Among the Oceanides,—that Heart To bind and bare and vex with vulture fell. I would, my noble England, men might seek All crimson stains upon thy breast—not cheek! XVIII I would that hostile fleets had scarred Torbay, Instead of the lone ship which waited moored Until thy princely purpose was assured, Then left a shadow, not to pass away— Not for to-night's moon, nor to-morrow's sun: Green watching hills, ye witnessed what was done! Written at Torquay. XIX But since it was done,—in sepulchral dust We fain would pay back something of our debt To France, if not to honour, and forget How through much fear we falsified the trust Of a fallen foe and exile. We return Orestes to Electra—in his urn. XX A little urn—a little dust inside, Which once outbalanced the large earth, albeit To-day a four-years child might carry it Sleek-browed and smiling, “Let the burden 'bide!” Orestes to Electra!—O fair town Of Paris, how the wild tears will run down XXI And run back in the chariot-marks of time, When all the people shall come forth to meet The passive victor, death-still in the street He rode through 'mid the shouting and bell-chime And martial music, under eagles which Dyed their rapacious beaks at Austerlitz! XXII Napoleon!—he hath come again, borne home Upon the popular ebbing heart,—a sea Which gathers its own wrecks perpetually, Majestically moaning. Give him room! Room for the dead in Paris! welcome solemn And grave-deep, 'neath the cannon-moulded column! It was the first intention to bury him under the column. XXIII There, weapon spent and warrior spent ma rest From roar of fields,—provided Jupiter Dare trust Saturnus to lie down so near His bolts!—and this he may: for, dispossessed Of any godship lies the godlike arm— The goat, Jove sucked, as likely to do harm. XXIV And yet . . . Napoleon!—the recovered name Shakes the old casements of the world; and we Look out upon the passing pageantry, Attesting that the Dead makes good his claim To a French grave,—another kingdom won, The last, of few spans—by Napoleon. XXV Blood fell like dew beneath his sunrise—sooth But glittered dew-like in the covenanted Meridian light. He was a despot—granted! But the ????? of his autocratic mouth Said yea i' the people's French; he magnified The image of the freedom he denied: XXVI And if they asked for rights, he made reply “Ye have my glory!”—and so, drawing round them His ample purple, glorified and bound them In an embrace that seemed identity. He ruled them like a tyrant—true! but none Were ruled like slaves: each felt Napoleon. XXVII I do not praise this man: the man was flawed For Adam—much more, Christ!—his knee unbent, His hand unclean, his aspiration pent Within a sword-sweep—pshaw!—but since he had The genius to be loved, why, let him have The justice to be honoured in his grave. XXVIII I think this nation's tears thus poured together, Better than shouts. I think this funeral Grander than crownings, though a Pope bless all. I think this grave stronger than thrones. But whether The crowned Napoleon or the buried clay Be worthier, I discern not: angels may. TO FLUSH, MY DOG. I Loving friend, the gift of one Who her own true faith has run Through thy lower nature, This dog was the gift of my dear and admired friend, Miss Mitford, and belongs to the beautiful race she has rendered celebrated among English and American readers. The Flushes have their laurels as well as the Cæsars, —the chief difference (at least the very head and front of it) consisting, perhaps, in the bald head of the latter under the crown. —1844. Be my benediction said With my hand upon thy head, Gentle fellow-creature! II Like a lady's ringlets brown, Flow thy silken ears adown Either side demurely Of thy silver-suited breast Shining out from all the rest Of thy body purely. III Darkly brown thy body is, Till the sunshine striking this Alchemise its dulness, When the sleek curls manifold Flash all over into gold With a burnished fulness. IV Underneath my stroking hand, Startled eyes of hazel bland Kindling, growing larger, Up thou leapest with a spring, Full of prank and curveting, Leaping like a charger. V Leap! thy broad tail waves a light, Leap! thy slender feet are bright, Canopied in fringes; Leap! those tasselled ears of thine Flicker strangely, fair and fine Down their golden inches. VI Yet, my pretty, sportive friend, Little is't to such an end That I praise thy rareness; Other dogs may be thy peers Haply in these drooping ears And this glossy fairness. VII But of thee it shall be said, This dog watched beside a bed Day and night unweary, Watched within a curtained room Where no sunbeam brake the gloom Round the sick and dreary. VIII Roses, gathered for a vase, In that chamber died apace, Beam and breeze resigning; This dog only, waited on, Knowing that when light is gone Love remains for shining. IX Other dogs in thymy dew Tracked the hares and followed through Sunny moor or meadow; This dog only, crept and crept Next a languid cheek that slept, Sharing in the shadow. X Other dogs of loyal cheer Bounded at the whistle clear, Up the woodside hieing; This dog only, watched in reach Of a faintly uttered speech Or a louder sighing. XI And if one or two quick tears Dropped upon his glossy ears Or a sigh came double, Up he sprang in eager haste, Fawning, fondling, breathing fast, In a tender trouble. XII And this dog was satisfied If a pale thin hand would glide Down his dewlaps sloping,— Which he pushed his nose within, After,—platforming his chin On the palm left open. XIII This dog, if a friendly voice Call him now to blither choice Than such chamber-keeping, “Come out!” praying from the door,— Presseth backward as before, Up against me leaping. XIV Therefore to this dog will I, Tenderly not scornfully, Render praise and favour: With my hand upon his head, Is my benediction said Therefore and for ever. XV And because he loves me so, Better than his kind will do Often man or woman, Give I back more love again Than dogs often take of men, Leaning from my Human. XVI Blessings on thee, dog of mine, Pretty collars make thee fine, Sugared milk make fat thee! Pleasures wag on in thy tail, Hands of gentle motion fail Nevermore, to pat thee! XVII Downy pillow take thy head, Silken coverlid bestead, Sunshine help thy sleeping! No fly's buzzing wake thee up, No man break thy purple cup Set for drinking deep in. XVIII Whiskered cats arointed flee, Sturdy stoppers keep from thee Cologne distillations; Nuts lie in thy path for stones, And thy feast-day macaroons Turn to daily rations! XIX Mock I thee, in wishing weal?— Tears are in my eyes to feel Thou art made so straitly, Blessing needs must straiten too,— Little canst thou joy or do, Thou who lovest greatly. XX Yet be blessèd to the height Of all good and all delight Pervious to thy nature; Only loved beyond that line, With a love that answers thine, Loving fellow-creature! THE FOURFOLD ASPECT. I. When ye stood up in the house With your little childish feet, And, in touching Life's first shows, First the touch of Love did meet,— Love and Nearness seeming one, By the heartlight cast before, And of all Beloveds, none Standing farther than the door; Not a name being dear to thought, With its owner beyond call; Not a face, unless it brought Its own shadow to the wall; When the worst recorded change Was of apple dropt from bough, When love's sorrow seemed more strange Than love's treason can seem now;— Then, the Loving took you up Soft, upon their elder knees, Telling why the statues droop Underneath the churchyard trees, And how ye must lie beneath them Through the winters long and deep, Till the last trump overbreathe them, And ye smile out of your sleep. Oh, ye lifted up your head, and it seemed as if they said A tale of fairy ships With a swan-wing for a sail; Oh, ye kissed their loving lips For the merry merry tale— So carelessly ye thought upon the Dead! II. Soon ye read in solemn stories Of the men of long ago, Of the pale bewildering glories Shining farther than we know; Of the heroes with the laurel, Of the poets with the bay, Of the two worlds' earnest quarrel For that beauteous Helena; How Achilles at the portal Of the tent heard footsteps nigh, And his strong heart, half-immortal, Met the keitai with a cry; How Ulysses left the sunlight For the pale eidola race Blank and passive through the dun light, Staring blindly in his face; How that true wife said to Pætus, With calm smile and wounded heart, “Sweet, it hurts not!” How Admetus Saw his blessed one depart; How King Arthur proved his mission, And Sir Roland wound his horn, And at Sangreal's moony vision Swords did bristle round like corn. Oh, ye lifted up your head, and it seemed, the while ye read, That this Death, then, must be found A Valhalla for the crowned, The heroic who prevail: None, be sure can enter in Far below a paladin Of a noble noble tale— So awfully ye thought upon the Dead! III. Ay, but soon ye woke up shrieking, As a child that wakes at night From a dream of sisters speaking In a garden's summer-light,— That wakes, starting up and bounding, In a lonely lonely bed, With a wall of darkness round him, Stifling black about his head! And the full sense of your mortal Rushed upon you deep and loud, And ye heard the thunder hurtle From the silence of the cloud. Funeral-torches at your gateway Threw a dreadful light within. All things changed: you rose up straightway, And saluted Death and Sin. Since, your outward man has rallied, And your eye and voice grown bold; Yet the Sphinx of Life stands pallid, With her saddest secret told. Happy places have grown holy: If ye went where once ye went, Only tears would fall down slowly, As at solemn sacrament. Merry books, once read for pastime, If ye dared to read again, Only memories of the last time Would swim darkly up the brain. Household names, which used to flutter Through your laughter unawares,— God's Divinest ye could utter With less trembling in your prayers. Ye have dropt adown your head, and it seems as if ye tread On your own hearts in the path Ye are called to in His wrath, And your prayers go up in wail —“Dost Thou see, then, all our loss, O Thou agonised on cross? Art thou reading all its tale?” So mournfully ye think upon the Dead! IV. Pray, pray, thou who also weepest, And the drops will slacken so. Weep, weep, and the watch thou keepest With a quicker count will go. Think: the shadow on the dial For the nature most undone, Marks the passing of the trial, Proves the presence of the sun. Look, look up, in starry passion, To the throne above the spheres: Learn: the spirit's gravitation Still must differ from the tear's. Hope: with all the strength thou usest In embracing thy despair. Love: the earthly love thou losest Shall return to thee more fair. Work: make clear the forest-tangles Of the wildest stranger-land. Trust: the blessèd deathly angels Whisper, “Sabbath hours at hand!” By the heart's wound when most gory, By the longest agony, Smile! Behold in sudden glory The Transfigured smiles on thee! And ye lifted up your head, and it seemed as if He said, “My Belovèd, is it so? Have ye tasted of my woe? Of my Heaven ye shall not fail!” He stands brightly where the shade is, With the keys of Death and Hades, And there, ends the mournful tale— So hopefully ye think upon the Dead! A FLOWER IN A LETTER. I My lonely chamber next the sea Is full of many flowers set free By summer's earliest duty: Dear friends upon the garden-walk Might stop amid their fondest talk To pull the least in beauty. II A thousand flowers, each seeming one That learnt by gazing on the sun To counterfeit his shining; Within whose leaves the holy dew That falls from heaven has won anew A glory, in declining. III Red roses, used to praises long, Contented with the poet's song, The nightingale's being over; And lilies white, prepared to touch The whitest thought, nor soil it much, Of dreamer turned to lover. IV Deep violets, you liken to The kindest eyes that look on you, Without a thought disloyal; And cactuses a queen might don If weary of a golden crown, And still appear as royal. V Pansies for ladies all,—I wis That none who wear such brooches miss A jewel in the mirror; And tulips, children love to stretch Their fingers down, to feel in each Its beauty's secret nearer. VI Love's language may be talked with these; To work out choicest sentences, No blossoms can be meeter; And, such being used in Eastern bowers, Young maids may wonder if the flowers Or meanings be the sweeter. VII And such being strewn before a bride, Her little foot may turn aside, Their longer bloom decreeing, Unless some voice's whispered sound Should make her gaze upon the ground Too earnestly for seeing. VIII And such being scattered on a grave, Whoever mourneth there may have A type which seemeth worthy Of that fair body hid below, Which bloomed on earth a time ago, Then perished as the earthy. IX And such being wreathed for worldly feast, Across the brimming cup some guest Their rainbow colours viewing May feel them, with a silent start, The covenant, his childish heart With nature made, renewing. X No flowers our gardened England hath To match with these, in bloom and breath, Which from the world are hiding In sunny Devon moist with rills,— A nunnery of cloistered hills, The elements presiding. XI By Loddon's stream the flowers are fair That meet one gifted lady's care With prodigal rewarding: (For Beauty is too used to run To Mitford's bower—to want the sun To light her through the garden). XII But here, all summers are comprised, The nightly frosts shrink exorcised Before the priestly moonshine; And every wind with stolèd feet In wandering down the alleys sweet Steps lightly on the sunshine. XIII And (having promised Harpocrate Among the nodding roses that No harm shall touch his daughters) Gives quite away the rushing sound He dares not use upon such ground To ever-trickling waters. XIV Yet, sun and wind! what can ye do But make the leaves more brightly show In posies newly gathered? I look away from all your best To one poor flower unlike the rest, A little flower half-withered. XV I do not think it ever was A pretty flower,—to make the grass Look greener where it reddened; And now it seems ashamed to be Alone, in all this company, Of aspect shrunk and saddened. XVI A chamber-window was the spot It grew in, from a garden-pot, Among the city shadows: If any, tending it, might seem To smile, 'twas only in a dream Of nature in the meadows. XVII How coldly on its head did fall The sunshine, from the city wall In pale refraction driven! How sadly plashed upon its leaves The raindrops, losing in the eaves The first sweet news of heaven! XVIII And those who planted, gathered it In gamesome or in loving fit, And sent it as a token Of what their city pleasures be,— For one, in Devon by the sea And garden blooms, to look on. XIX But she for whom the jest was meant, With a grave passion innocent Receiving what was given,— Oh, if her face she turnèd then, Let none say 'twas to gaze again Upon the flowers of Devon! XX Because, whatever virtue dwells In genial skies, warm oracles For gardens brightly springing,— The flower which grew beneath your eyes, Belovèd friends, to mine supplies A beauty worthier singing! THE CRY OF THE HUMAN. I “There is no God” the foolish saith, But none “There is no sorrow,” And nature oft the cry of faith In bitter need will borrow: Eyes, which the preacher could not school, By wayside graves are raisèd, And lips say “God be pitiful,” Who ne'er said “God be praisèd.” Be pitiful, O God! II The tempest stretches from the steep The shadow of its coming, The beasts grow tame and near us creep, As help were in the human; Yet, while the cloud-wheels roll and grind, We spirits tremble under— The hills have echoes, but we find No answer for the thunder. Be pitiful, O God! III The battle hurtles on the plains, Earth feels new scythes upon her; We reap our brothers for the wains, And call the harvest—honour: Draw face to face, front line to line, One image all inherit,— Then kill, curse on, by that same sign, Clay—clay, and spirit—spirit. Be pitiful, O God! IV The plague runs festering through the town, And never a bell is tolling, And corpses, jostled 'neath the moon, Nod to the dead-cart's rolling: The young child calleth for the cup, The strong man brings it weeping, The mother from her babe looks up, And shrieks away its sleeping. Be pitiful, O God! V The plague of gold strikes far and near, And deep and strong it enters; This purple chimar which we wear Makes madder than the centaur's: Our thoughts grow blank, our words grow strange, We cheer the pale gold-diggers, Each soul is worth so much on 'Change, And marked, like sheep, with figures. Be pitiful, O God! VI The curse of gold upon the land The lack of bread enforces; The rail-cars snort from strand to strand, Like more of Death's White Horses: The rich preach “rights” and “future days,” And hear no angel scoffing, The poor die mute, with starving gaze On corn-ships in the offing. Be pitiful, O God! VII We meet together at the feast, To private mirth betake us; We stare down in the winecup, lest Some vacant chair should shake us: We name delight, and pledge it round— “It shall be ours to-morrow!” God's seraphs, do your voices sound As sad, in naming sorrow? Be pitiful, O God! VIII We sit together, with the skies, The steadfast skies, above us, We look into each other's eyes, “And how long will you love us?” The eyes grow dim with prophecy, The voices, low and breathless,— “Till death us part!”—O words, to be Our best, for love the deathless! Be pitiful, O God! IX We tremble by the harmless bed Of one loved and departed: Our tears drop on the lips that said Last night “Be stronger-hearted!” O God—to clasp those fingers close, And yet to feel so lonely! To see a light upon such brows, Which is the daylight only! Be pitiful, O God! X The happy children come to us And look up in our faces; They ask us “Was it thus, and thus, When we were in their places?” We cannot speak;—we see anew The hills we used to live in, And feel our mother's smile press through The kisses she is giving. Be pitiful, O God! XI We pray together at the kirk For mercy, mercy solely: Hands weary with the evil work, We lift them to the Holy. The corpse is calm below our knee, Its spirit, bright before Thee: Between them, worse than either, we— Without the rest or glory. Be pitiful, O God! XII We leave the communing of men, The murmur of the passions, And live alone, to live again With endless generations: Are we so brave? The sea and sky In silence lift their mirrors, And, glassed therein, our spirits high Recoil from their own terrors. Be pitiful, O God! XIII We sit on hills our childhood wist, Woods, hamlets, streams, beholding The sun strikes through the farthest mist The city's spire to golden: The city's golden spire it was, When hope and health were strongest, But now it is the churchyard grass We look upon the longest. Be pitiful, O God! XIV And soon all vision waxeth dull; Men whisper “He is dying;” We cry no more “Be pitiful!” We have no strength for crying: No strength, no need. Then, soul of mine, Look up and triumph rather! Lo, in the depth of God's Divine, The Son adjures the Father, Be pitiful, O God! A LAY OF THE EARLY ROSE. “? discordance that can accord.” —Romaunt of the Rose. A rose once grew within A garden April-green, In her loneness, in her loneness, And the fairer for that oneness. A white rose delicate On a tall bough and straight: Early comer, early comer, Never waiting for the summer. Her pretty gestes did win South winds to let her in, In her loneness, in her loneness, All the fairer for that oneness. “For if I wait,” said she, “Till time for roses be, For the moss-rose and the musk-rose, Maiden-blush and royal-dusk rose, “What glory then for me In such a company?— Roses plenty, roses plenty, And one nightingale for twenty! “Nay, let me in,” said she, “Before the rest are free, In my loneness, in my loneness, All the fairer for that oneness. “For I would lonely stand Uplifting my white hand, On a mission, on a mission, To declare the coming vision. “Upon which lifted sign, What worship will be mine! What addressing, what caressing, And what thanks and praise and blessing! “A windlike joy will rush Through every tree and bush, Bending softly in affection And spontaneous benediction. “Insects, that only may Live in a sunbright ray, To my whiteness, to my whiteness, Shall be drawn as to a brightness,— “And every moth and bee Approach me reverently, Wheeling o'er me, wheeling o'er me, Coronals of motioned glory. “Three larks shall leave a cloud, To my whiter beauty vowed, Singing gladly all the moontide, Never waiting for the suntide. “Ten nightingales shall flee Their woods for love of me, Singing sadly all the suntide, Never waiting for the moontide. “I ween the very skies Will look down with surprise, When below on earth they see me With my starry aspect dreamy. “And earth will call her flowers To hasten out of doors, By their curtsies and sweet-smelling To give grace to my foretelling.” So praying, did she win South winds to let her in, In her loneness, in her loneness, And the fairer for that oneness. But ah,—alas for her! No thing did minister To her praises, to her praises, More than might unto a daisy's. No tree nor bush was seen To boast a perfect green, Scarcely having, scarcely having One leaf broad enough for waving. The little flies did crawl Along the southern wall, Faintly shifting, faintly shifting Wings scarce long enough for lifting. The lark, too high or low, I ween, did miss her so, With his nest down in the gorses, And his song in the star-courses. The nightingale did please To loiter beyond seas: Guess him in the Happy Islands, Learning music from the silence! Only the bee, forsooth, Came in the place of both, Doing honour, doing honour To the honey-dews upon her. The skies looked coldly down As on a royal crown; Then with drop for drop, at leisure, They began to rain for pleasure. Whereat the earth did seem To waken from a dream, Winter-frozen, winter-frozen, Her unquiet eyes unclosing— Said to the Rose, “Ha, snow! And art thou fallen so? Thou, who wast enthronèd stately All along my mountains lately? “Holla, thou world-wide snow! And art thou wasted so, With a little bough to catch thee, And a little bee to watch thee?” —Poor Rose, to be misknown! Would she had ne'er been blown, In her loneness, in her loneness, All the sadder for that oneness! Some word she tried to say, Some no . . . ah, wellaway! But the passion did o'ercome her, And the fair frail leaves dropped from her. —Dropped from her fair and mute, Close to a poet's foot, Who beheld them, smiling slowly, As at something sad yet holy,— Said “Verily and thus It chances too with us Poets, singing sweetest snatches While that deaf men keep the watches: “Vaunting to come before Our own age evermore, In a loneness, in a loneness, And the nobler for that oneness. “Holy in voice and heart, To high ends, set apart: All unmated, all unmated, Just because so consecrated. “But if alone we be, Where is our empery? And if none can reach our stature, Who can mete our lofty nature? “What bell will yield a tone, Swung in the air alone? If no brazen clapper bringing, Who can hear the chimèd ringing? “What angel but would seem To sensual eyes, ghost-dim? And without assimilation, Vain is interpenetration. “And thus, what can we do, Poor rose and poet too, Who both antedate our mission In an unpreparèd season? “Drop, leaf! be silent, song! Cold things we come among: We must warm them, we must warm them, Ere we ever hope to charm them. “Howbeit” (here his face Lightened around the place, So to mark the outward turning Of its spirit's inward burning) “Something it is, to hold In God's worlds manifold, First revealed to creature-duty, Some new form of His mild Beauty. “Whether that form respect The sense or intellect, Holy be, in mood or meadow, The Chief Beauty's sign and shadow! “Holy, in me and thee, Rose fallen from the tree,— Though the world stand dumb around us, All unable to expound us. Though none us deign to bless, Blessèd are we, natheless; Blessèd still and consecrated In that, rose, we were created. “Oh, shame to poet's lays Sung for the dole of praise,— Hoarsely sung upon the highway With that obolum da mihi! “Shame, shame to poet's soul Pining for such a dole, When Heaven-chosen to inherit The high throne of a chief spirit! “Sit still upon your thrones, O ye poetic ones! And if, sooth, the world decry you, Let it pass unchallenged by you. “Ye to yourselves suffice, Without its flatteries. Self-contentedly approve you Unto Him who sits above you,— “In prayers, that upward mount Like to a fair-sunned fount Which, in gushing back upon you, Hath an upper music won you,— “In faith, that still perceives No rose can shed her leaves, Far less, poet fall from mission, With an unfulfilled fruition,— “In hope, that apprehends An end beyond these ends, And great uses rendered duly By the meanest song sung truly,— “In thanks, for all the good By poets understood, For the sound of seraphs moving Down the hidden depths of loving,— “For sights of things away Through fissures of the clay, Promised things which shall be given And sung over, up in Heaven,— “For life, so lovely-vain, For death, which breaks the chain, For this sense of present sweetness, And this yearning to completeness!” BERTHA IN THE LANE. I Put the broidery-frame away, For my sewing is all done: The last thread is used to-day, And I need not join it on. Though the clock stands at the noon I am weary. I have sewn, Sweet, for thee, a wedding-gown. II Sister, help me to the bed, And stand near me, Dearest-sweet. Do not shrink nor be afraid, Blushing with a sudden heat! No one standeth in the street?— By God's love I go to meet, Love I thee with love complete. III Lean thy face down; drop it in These two hands, that I may hold 'Twixt their palms thy cheek and chin, Stroking back the curls of gold: 'Tis a fair, fair face, in sooth— Larger eyes and redder mouth Than mine were in my first youth. IV Thou art younger by seven years— Ah!—so bashful at my gaze, That the lashes, hung with tears, Grow too heavy to upraise? I would wound thee by no touch Which thy shyness feels as such. Dost thou mind me, Dear, so much? V Have I not been nigh a mother To thy sweetness—tell me, Dear? Have we not loved one another Tenderly, from year to year, Since our dying mother mild Said with accents undefiled, “Child, be mother to this child”! VI Mother, mother, up in heaven, Stand up on the jasper sea, And be witness I have given All the gifts required of me,— Hope that blessed me, bliss that crowned, Love that left me with a wound, Life itself that turneth round! VII Mother, mother, thou art kind, Thou art standing in the room, In a molten glory shrined That rays off into the gloom! But thy smile is bright and bleak Like cold waves—I cannot speak, I sob in it, and grow weak. VIII Ghostly mother, keep aloof One hour longer from my soul, For I still am thinking of Earth's warm-beating joy and dole! On my finger is a ring Which I still see glittering When the night hides everything IX Little sister, thou art pale! Ah, I have a wandering brain— But I lose that fever-bale, And my thoughts grow calm again. Lean down closer—closer still! I have words thine ear to fill, And would kiss thee at my will. X Dear, I heard thee in the spring, Thee and Robert—through the trees,— When we all went gathering Boughs of May-bloom for the bees. Do not start so! think instead How the sunshine overhead Seemed to trickle through the shade. XI What a day it was, that day! Hills and vales did openly Seem to heave and throb away At the sight of the great sky: And the silence, as it stood In the glory's golden flood, Audibly did bud, and bud. XII Through the winding hedgerows green, How we wandered, I and you, With the bowery tops shut in, And the gates that showed the view! How we talked there; thrushes soft Sang our praises out, or oft Bleatings took them from the croft: XIII Till the pleasure grown too strong Left me muter evermore, And, the winding road being long, I walked out of sight, before, And so, wrapt in musings fond, Issued (past the wayside pond) On the meadow-lands beyond. XIV I sate down beneath the beech Which leans over to the lane, And the far sound of your speech Did not promise any pain; And I blessed you full and free, With a smile stooped tenderly O'er the May-flowers on my knee. XV But the sound grew into word As the speakers drew more near— Sweet, forgive me that I heard What you wished me not to hear. Do not weep so, do not shake, Oh,—I heard thee, Bertha, make Good true answers for my sake. XVI Yes, and he too! let him stand In thy thoughts, untouched by blame. Could he help it, if my hand He had claimed with hasty claim? That was wrong perhaps—but then Such things be—and will, again. Women cannot judge for men. XVII Had he seen thee when he swore He would love but me alone? Thou wast absent, sent before To our kin in Sidmouth town. When he saw thee who art best Past compare, and loveliest, He but judged thee as the rest. XVIII Could we blame him with grave words, Thou and I, Dear, if we might? Thy brown eyes have looks like birds Flying straightway to the light: Mine are older.—Hush!—look out— Up the street! Is none without? How the poplar swings about! XIX And that hour—beneath the beech, When I listened in a dream, And he said in his deep speech That he owed me all esteem,— Each word swam in on my brain With a dim, dilating pain, Till it burst with that last strain. XX I fell flooded with a dark, In the silence of a swoon. When I rose, still cold and stark, There was night; I saw the moon And the stars, each in its place, And the May-blooms on the grass, Seemed to wonder what I was. XXI And I walked as if apart From myself, when I could stand, And I pitied my own heart, As if I held it in my hand— Somewhat coldly, with a sense Of fulfilled benevolence, And a “Poor thing” negligence. XXII And I answered coldly too, When you met me at the door; And I only heard the dew Dripping from me to the floor: And the flowers, I bade you see, Were too withered for the bee,— As my life, henceforth, for me. XXIII Do not weep so—Dear,—heart-warm! All was best as it befell. If I say he did me harm, I speak wild,—I am not well. All his words were kind and good— He esteemed me. Only, blood Runs so faint in womanhood! XXIV Then I always was too grave,— Like the saddest ballad sung,— With that look, besides, we have In our faces, who die young. I had died, Dear, all the same; Life's long, joyous, jostling game Is too loud for my meek shame. XXV We are so unlike each other, Thou and I, that none could guess We were children of one mother, But for mutual tenderness. Thou art rose-lined from the cold, And meant verily to hold Life's pure pleasures manifold. XXVI I am pale as crocus grows Close beside a rose-tree's root; Whosoe'er would reach the rose, Treads the crocus underfoot. I, like May-bloom on thorn-tree, Thou, like merry summer-bee,— Fit that I be plucked for thee! XXVII Yet who plucks me?—no one mourns, I have lived my season out, And now die of my own thorns Which I could not live without. Sweet, be merry! How the light Comes and goes! If it be night, Keep the candles in my sight. XXVIII Are there footsteps at the door? Look out quickly. Yea, or nay? Some one might be waiting for Some last word that I might say. Nay? So best!—so angels would Stand off clear from deathly road, Not to cross the sight of God. XXIX Colder grow my hands and feet. When I wear the shroud I made, Let the folds lie straight and neat, And the rosemary be spread, That if any friend should come, (To see thee, Sweet!) all the room May be lifted out of gloom. XXX And, dear Bertha, let me keep On my hand this little ring, Which at nights, when others sleep, I can still see glittering! Let me wear it out of sight, In the grave,—where it will light All the dark up, day and night. XXXI On that grave drop not a tear! Else, though fathom-deep the place, Through the woollen shroud I wear I shall feel it on my face. Rather smile there, blessèd one, Thinking of me in the sun, Or forget me—smiling on! XXXII Art thou near me? nearer! so— Kiss me close upon the eyes, That the earthly light may go Sweetly, as it used to rise When I watched the morning-grey Strike, betwixt the hills, the way He was sure to come that day. XXXIII So,—no more vain words be said! The hosannas nearer roll. Mother, smile now on thy Dead, I am death-strong in my soul. Mystic Dove alit on cross, Guide the poor bird of the snows Through the snow-wind above loss! XXXIV Jesus, Victim, comprehending Love's divine self-abnegation, Cleanse my love in its self-spending, And absorb the poor libation! Wind my thread of life up higher, Up, through angels' hands of fire! I aspire while I expire. THAT DAY. I I stand by the river where both of us stood, And there is but one shadow to darken the flood; And the path leading to it, where both used to pass, Has the step but of one, to take dew from the grass,— One forlorn since that day. II The flowers of the margin are many to see; None stoops at my bidding to pluck them for me. The bird in the alder sings loudly and long,— My low sound of weeping disturbs not his song, As thy vow did, that day. III I stand by the river, I think of the vow; Oh, calm as the place is, vow-breaker, be thou! I leave the flower growing, the bird unreproved; Would I trouble thee rather than them, my beloved,— And my lover that day? IV Go, be sure of my love, by that treason forgiven; Of my prayers, by the blessings they win thee from Heaven; Of my grief—(guess the length of the sword by the sheath's) By the silence of life, more pathetic than death's! Go,—be clear of that day! LOVED ONCE. I I classed, appraising once, Earth's lamentable sounds,—the welladay, The jarring yea and nay, The fall of kisses on unanswering clay, The sobbed farewell, the welcome mournfuller,— But all did leaven the air With a less bitter leaven of sure despair Than these words—“I loved once.” II And who saith “I loved once”? Not angels,—whose clear eyes, love, love foresee, Love, through eternity, And by To Love do apprehend To Be. Not God, called Love, His noble crown-name casting, A light too broad for blasting: The great God, changing not from everlasting, Saith never “I loved once.” III Oh, never is “Loved once” Thy word, Thou Victim-Christ, misprizèd friend! Thy cross and curse may rend, But having loved Thou lovest to the end. This is man's saying—man's: too weak to move One spherèd star above, Man desecrates the eternal God-word Love By his No More, and Once. IV How say ye “We loved once,” Blasphemers? Is your earth not cold enow, Mourners, without that snow? Ah friends, and would ye wrong each other so? And could ye say of some whose love is known, Whose prayers have met your own, Whose tears have fallen for you, whose smiles have shone So long,—“We loved them once”? V Could ye “We loved her once” Say calm of me, sweet friends, when out of sight? When hearts of better right Stand in between me and your happy light? Or when, as flowers kept too long in the shade, Ye find my colours fade, And all that is not love in me decayed? Such words—Ye loved me once! VI Could ye “We loved her once” Say cold of me when further put away In earth's sepulchral clay, When mute the lips which deprecate today? Not so! not then—least then! When life is shriven And death's full joy is given,— Of those who sit and love you up in heaven Say not “We loved them once.” VII Say never ye loved once: God is too near above, the grave beneath, And all our moments breathe Too quick in mysteries of life and death, For such a word. The eternities avenge Affections light of range. There comes no change to justify that change, Whatever comes—Loved once! VIII And yet that same word once Is humanly acceptive. Kings have said, Shaking a discrowned head, “We ruled once,”—dotards, “We once taught and led,” Cripples once danced i' the vines, and bards approved, Were once by scornings moved: But love strikes one hour—love! Those never loved Who dream that they loved once. RHAPSODY OF LIFE'S PROGRESS. “Fill all the stops of life with tuneful breath.” Poems on Man, by Cornelius Mathews. A small volume, by an American poet—as remarkable in thought and manner for a vital sinewy vigour, as the right arm of “Pathfinder.” —1844. I. We are borne into life—it is sweet, it is strange. We lie still on the knee of a mild Mystery Which smiles with a change; But we doubt not of changes, we know not of spaces, The Heavens seem as near as our own mother's face is, And we think we could touch all the stars that we see; And the milk of our mother is white on our mouth; And, with small childish hands, we are turning around The apple of Life which another has found; It is warm with our touch, not with sun of the south, And we count, as we turn it, the red side for four. O Life, O Beyond, Thou art sweet, thou art strange evermore! II. Then all things look strange in the pure golden æther; We walk through the gardens with hands linked together, And the lilies look large as the trees; And, as loud as the birds, sing the bloom-loving bees, And the birds sing like angels, so mystical-fine, And the cedars are brushing the archangels' feet, And time is eternity, love is divine, And the world is complete. Now, God bless the child,—father, mother, respond! O Life, O Beyond, Thou art strange, thou art sweet. III. Then we leap on the earth with the armour of youth, And the earth rings again; And we breathe out “O beauty!” we cry out “O truth!” And the bloom of our lips drops with wine, And our blood runs amazed 'neath the calm hyaline; The earth cleaves to the foot, the sun burns to the brain,— What is this exultation? and what this despair?— The strong pleasure is smiting the nerves into pain, And we drop from the Fair as we climb to the Fair, And we lie in a trance at its feet; And the breath of an angel cold-piercing the air Breathes fresh on our faces in swoon, And we think him so near he is this side the sun, And we wake to a whisper self-murmured and fond, O Life, O Beyond, Thou art strange, thou art sweet! IV. And the winds and the waters in pastoral measures Go winding around us, with roll upon roll, Till the soul lies within in a circle of pleasures Which hideth the soul: And we run with the stag, and we leap with the horse, And we swim with the fish through the broad watercourse, And we strike with the falcon, and hunt with the hound, And the joy which is in us flies out by a wound. And we shout so aloud, “We exult, we rejoice,” That we lose the low moan of our brothers around: And we shout so adeep down creation's profound, We are deaf to God's voice. And we bind the rose-garland on forehead and ears Yet we are not ashamed, And the dew of the roses that runneth unblamed Down our cheeks, is not taken for tears. Help us, God! trust us, man! love us, woman! “I hold Thy small head in my hands,—with its grapelets of gold Growing bright through my fingers,—like altar for oath, 'Neath the vast golden spaces like witnessing faces That watch the eternity strong in the troth— I love thee, I leave thee, Live for thee, die for thee! I prove thee, deceive thee, Undo evermore thee! Help me, God! slay me, man!—one is mourning for both.” And we stand up though young near the funeral-sheet Which covers old Cæsar and old Pharamond, And death is so nigh us, life cools from its heat. O Life, O Beyond, Art thou fair, art thou sweet? V. Then we act to a purpose, we spring up erect: We will tame the wild mouths of the wilderness-steeds, We will plough up the deep in the ships double-decked, We will build the great cities, and do the great deeds, Strike the steel upon steel, strike the soul upon soul, Strike the dole on the weal, overcoming the dole. Let the cloud meet the cloud in a grand thunder-roll! “While the eagle of Thought rides the tempest in scorn, Who cares if the lightning is burning the corn? Let us sit on the thrones In a purple sublimity, And grind down men's bones To a pale unanimity. Speed me, God! serve me, man! I am god over men; When I speak in my cloud, none shall answer again; 'Neath the stripe and the bond, Lie and mourn at my feet!” O Life, O Beyond, Thou art strange, thou art sweet! VI. Then we grow into thought, and with inward ascensions Touch the bounds of our Being. We lie in the dark here, swathed doubly around With our sensual relations and social conventions, Yet are 'ware of a sight, yet are 'ware of a sound Beyond Hearing and Seeing,— Are aware that a Hades rolls deep on all sides With its infinite tides About and above us,—until the strong arch Of our life creaks and bends as if ready for falling, And through the dim rolling we hear the sweet calling Of spirits that speak in a soft under-tongue The sense of the mystical march: And we cry to them softly, “Come nearer, come nearer, And lift up the lap of this dark, and speak clearer, And teach us the song that ye sung!” And we smile in our thought as they answer or no, For to dream of a sweetness is sweet as to know. Wonders breathe in our face And we ask not their name; Love takes all the blame Of the world's prison-place; And we sing back the songs as we guess them, aloud, And we send up the lark of our music that cuts Untired through the cloud To beat with its wings at the lattice Heaven shuts; Yet the angels look down and the mortals look up As the little wings beat, And the poet is blessed with their pity or hope. 'Twixt the heavens and the earth can a poet despond? O Life, O Beyond, Thou art strange, thou art sweet! VII. Then we wring from our souls their applicative strength, And bend to the cord the strong bow of our ken, And bringing our lives to the level of others, Hold the cup we have filled, to their uses at length. “Help me, God! love me, man! I am man among men, And my life is a pledge Of the ease of another's!” From the fire and the water we drive out the steam With a rush and a roar and the speed of a dream; And the car without horses, the car without wings, Roars onward and flies On its grey iron edge 'Neath the heat of a Thought sitting still in our eyes: And our hand knots in air, with the bridge that it flings, Two peaks far disrupted by ocean and skies, And, lifting a fold of the smooth-flowing Thames, Draws under the world with its turmoils and pothers, While the swans float on softly, untouched in their calms By humanity's hum at the root of the springs. And with reachings of Thought we reach down to the deeps Of the souls of our brothers, We teach them full words with our slow-moving lips, “God,” “Liberty,” “Truth,”—which they hearken and think And work into harmony, link upon link, Till the silver meets round the earth gelid and dense, Shedding sparks of electric responding intense On the dark of eclipse. Then we hear through the silence and glory afar, As from shores of a star In aphelion, the new generations that cry Disenthralled by our voice to harmonious reply, “God,” “Liberty,” “Truth!” We are glorious forsooth, And our name has a seat, Though the shroud should be donned. O Life, O Beyond, Thou art strange, thou art sweet! VIII. Help me, God! help me, man! I am low, I am weak: Death loosens my sinews and creeps in my veins; My body is cleft by these wedges of pains From my spirit's serene, And I feel the externe and insensate creep in On my organised clay; I sob not, nor shriek, Yet I faint fast away: I am strong in the spirit,—deep-thoughted, clear-eyed,— I could walk, step for step, with an angel beside, On the heaven-heights of truth. Oh, the soul keeps its youth But the body faints sore, it is tried in the race, It sinks from the chariot ere reaching the goal, It is weak, it is cold, The rein drops from its hold, It sinks back, with the death in its face. On, chariot! on, soul! Ye are all the more fleet— Be alone at the goal Of the strange and the sweet! IX. Love us, God! love us, man! we believe, we achieve: Let us love, let us live, For the acts correspond; We are glorious, and die: And again on the knee of a mild Mystery That smiles with a change, Here we lie. O Death, O Beyond, Thou art sweet, thou art strange! L. E. L.'S LAST QUESTION. “Do you think of me as I think of you?” (From her poem written during the voyage to the Cape.) I. “Do you think of me as I think of you, My friends, my friends?”—She said it from the sea, The English minstrel in her minstrelsy, While, under brighter skies than erst she knew, Her heart grew dark, and groped there as the blind To reach across the waves friends left behind— “Do you think of me as I think of you?” II. It seemed not much to ask—“as I of you?” We all do ask the same; no eyelids cover Within the meekest eyes that question over: And little in the world the Loving do But sit (among the rocks?) and listen for The echo of their own love evermore— “Do you think of me as I think of you?” III. Love-learnèd she had sung of love and love,— And like a child that, sleeping with dropt head Upon the fairy-book he lately read, Whatever household noises round him move, Hears in his dream some elfin turbulence,— Even so suggestive to her inward sense, All sounds of life assumed one tune of love. IV. And when the glory of her dream withdrew, When knightly gestes and courtly pageantries Were broken in her visionary eyes By tears the solemn seas attested true,— Forgetting that sweet lute beside her hand, She asked not,—“Do you praise me, O my land?” But,—“Think ye of me, friends, as I of you?” V. Hers was the hand that played for many a year Love's silver phrase for England, smooth and well. Would God her heart's more inward oracle In that lone moment might confirm her dear! For when her questioned friends in agony Made passionate response, “We think of thee,” Her place was in the dust, too deep to hear. VI. Could she not wait to catch their answering breath? Was she content, content with ocean's sound Which dashed its mocking infinite around One thirsty for a little love?—beneath Those stars content, where last her song had gone,— They mute and cold in radiant life, as soon Their singer was to be, in darksome death? Her lyric on the Polar Star came home with her latest papers. VII. Bring your vain answers—cry, “We think of thee!” How think ye of her? warm in long ago Delights? or crowned with budding bays? Not so. None smile and none are crowned where lieth she, With all her visions unfulfilled save one, Her childhood's, of the palm-trees in the sun— And lo! their shadow on her sepulchre! VIII. “Do ye think of me as I think of you?”— O friends, O kindred, O dear brotherhood Of all the world! what are we that we should For covenants of long affection sue? Why press so near each other when the touch Is barred by graves? Not much, and yet too much Is this “Think of me as I think of you.” IX. But while on mortal lips I shape anew A sigh to mortal issues, verily Above the unshaken stars that see us die, A vocal pathos rolls; and He who drew All life from dust, and for all tasted death, By death and life and love appealing, saith Do you think of me as I think of you? THE HOUSE OF CLOUDS. I I would build a cloudy House For my thoughts to live in, When for earth too fancy-loose, And too low for heaven: Hush! I talk my dream aloud, I build it bright to see,— I build it on the moonlit cloud To which I looked with thee. II Cloud-walls of the morning's grey, Faced with amber column, Crowned with crimson cupola From a sunset solemn: May-mists, for the casements, fetch, Pale and glimmering, With a sunbeam hid in each And a smell of spring. III Build the entrance high and proud, Darkening and then brightening, Of a riven thunder-cloud, Veinèd by the lightning: Use one with an iris-stain For the door so thin, Turning to a sound like rain As I enter in. IV Build a spacious hall thereby Boldly, never fearing; Use the blue place of the sky Which the wind is clearing: Branched with corridors sublime, Flecked with winding stairs, Such as children wish to climb Following their own prayers. V In the mutest of the house I will have my chamber; Silence at the door shall use Evening's light of amber, Solemnising every mood, Softening in degree, Turning sadness into good As I turn the key. VI Be my chamber tapestried With the showers of summer, Close, but soundless, glorified When the sunbeams come here— Wandering harpers, harping on Waters stringed for such, Drawing colour, for a tune, With a vibrant touch. VII Bring a shadow green and still From the chestnut-forest, Bring a purple from the hill, When the heat is sorest; Spread them out from wall to wall, Carpet-wove around, Whereupon the foot shall fall In light instead of sound. VIII Bring fantastic cloudlets home From the noontide zenith, Ranged for sculptures round the room, Named as Fancy weeneth; Some be Junos, without eyes, Naiads, without sources, Some be birds of paradise, Some, Olympian horses. IX Bring the dews the birds shake off Waking in the hedges,— Those too perfumed, for a proof, From the lilies' edges: From our England's field and moor, Bring them calm and white in, Whence to form a mirror pure For Love's self-delighting. X Bring a grey cloud from the east Where the lark is singing, (Something of the song at least Unlost in the bringing): That shall be a morning-chair, Poet-dream may sit in When it leans out on the air, Unrhymed and unwritten. XI Bring the red cloud from the sun, While he sinketh catch it; That shall be a couch,—with one Sidelong star to watch it,— Fit for poet's finest thought At the curfew-sounding; Things unseen being nearer brought Than the seen, around him. XII Poet's thought,—not poet's sigh. 'Las, they come together! Cloudy walls divide and fly As in April weather. Cupola and column proud, Structure bright to see, Gone! except that moonlit cloud To which I looked with thee. XIII Let them! Wipe such visionings From the fancy's cartel: Love secures some fairer things, Dowered with his immortal. The sun may darken, heaven be bowed, But still unchanged shall be,— Here, in my soul,—that moonlit cloud To which I looked with thee! CATARINA TO CAMOENS (DYING IN HIS ABSENCE ABROAD, AND REFERRING TO THE POEM IN WHICH HE RECORDED THE SWEETNESS OF HER EYES). I On the door you will not enter, I have gazed too long: adieu! Hope withdraws her peradventure; Death is near me,—and not you. Come, O lover, Close and cover These poor eyes, you called, I ween, “Sweetest eyes were ever seen!” II When I heard you sing that burden In my vernal days and bowers, Other praises disregarding, I but hearkened that of yours— Only saying In heart-playing, “Blessed eyes mine eyes have been, If the sweetest his have seen!” III But all changes. At this vesper, Cold the sun shines down the door. If you stood there, would you whisper “Love, I love you,” as before,— Death pervading Now, and shading Eyes you sang of, that yestreen, As the sweetest ever seen? IV Yes. I think, were you beside them, Near the bed I die upon, Though their beauty you denied them, As you stood there, looking down, You would truly Call them duly, For the love's sake found therein, “Sweetest eyes were ever seen.” V And if you looked down upon them, And if they looked up to you, All the light which has foregone them Would be gathered back anew: They would truly Be as duly Love-transformed to beauty's sheen, “Sweetest eyes were ever seen.” VI But, ah me! you only see me, In your thoughts of loving man, Smiling soft perhaps and dreamy Through the wavings of my fan; And unweeting Go repeating, In your reverie serene, “Sweetest eyes were ever seen—” VII While my spirit leans and reaches From my body still and pale, Fain to hear what tender speech is In your love to help my bale. O my poet, Come and show it! Come, of latest love, to glean “Sweetest eyes were ever seen.” VIII O my poet, O my prophet, When you praised their sweetness so, Did you think, in singing of it, That it might be near to go? Had you fancies From their glances, That the grave would quickly screen “Sweetest eyes were ever seen”? IX No reply. The fountain's warble In the courtyard sounds alone. As the water to the marble So my heart falls with a moan From love-sighing To this dying. Death forerunneth Love to win “Sweetest eyes were ever seen.” X Will you come? When I'm departed Where all sweetnesses are hid, Where thy voice, my tender-hearted, Will not lift up either lid. Cry, O lover, Love is over! Cry, beneath the cypress green, “Sweetest eyes were ever seen!” XI When the angelus is ringing, Near the convent will you walk, And recall the choral singing Which brought angels down our talk? Spirit-shriven I viewed Heaven, Till you smiled—“Is earth unclean, Sweetest eyes were ever seen?” XII When beneath the palace-lattice You ride slow as you have done, And you see a face there that is Not the old familiar one,— Will you oftly Murmur softly, “Here ye watched me morn and e'en, Sweetest eyes were ever seen!” XIII When the palace-ladies, sitting Round your gittern, shall have said, “Poet, sing those verses written For the lady who is dead,” Will you tremble Yet dissemble,— Or sing hoarse, with tears between, “Sweetest eyes were ever seen”? XIV “Sweetest eyes!” how sweet in flowings The repeated cadence is! Though you sang a hundred poems, Still the best one would be this. I can hear it 'Twixt my spirit And the earth-noise intervene— “Sweetest eyes were ever seen!” XV But the priest waits for the praying, And the choir are on their knees, And the soul must pass away in Strains more solemn-high than these. Miserere For the weary! Oh, no longer for Catrine “Sweetest eyes were ever seen!” XVI Keep my riband, take and keep it, (I have loosed it from my hair) She left him the riband from her hair. Feeling, while you overweep it, Not alone in your despair, Since with saintly Watch unfaintly Out of heaven shall o'er you lean “Sweetest eyes were ever seen.” XVII But—but now—yet unremovèd Up to heaven, they glisten fast; You may cast away, Belovèd, In your future all my past: Such old phrases May be praises For some fairer bosom-queen— “Sweetest eyes were ever seen!” XVIII Eyes of mine, what are ye doing? Faithless, faithless,—praised amiss If a tear be of your showing, Dropt for any hope of his! Death has boldness Besides coldness, If unworthy tears demean “Sweetest eyes were ever seen.” XIX I will look out to his future; I will bless it till it shine. Should he ever be a suitor Unto sweeter eyes than mine, Sunshine gild them, Angels shield them, Whatsoever eyes terrene Be the sweetest his have seen! A PORTRAIT. “One name is Elizabeth.” —Ben Jonson. I will paint her as I see her. Ten times have the lilies blown Since she looked upon the sun. And her face is lily-clear, Lily-shaped, and dropped in duty To the law of its own beauty. Oval cheeks encoloured faintly, Which a trail of golden hair Keeps from fading off to air: And a forehead fair and saintly, Which two blue eyes undershine, Like meek prayers before a shrine. Face and figure of a child,— Though too calm, you think, and tender, For the childhood you would lend her. Yet child-simple, undefiled, Frank, obedient, waiting still On the turnings of your will. Moving light, as all young things, As young birds, or early wheat When the wind blows over it. Only, free from flutterings Of loud mirth that scorneth measure— Taking love for her chief pleasure. Choosing pleasures, for the rest, Which come softly—just as she, When she nestles at your knee. Quiet talk she liketh best, In a bower of gentle looks,— Watering flowers, or reading books. And her voice, it murmurs lowly, As a silver stream may run, Which yet feels (you feel) the sun. And her smile it seems half holy, As if drawn from thoughts more far Than our common jestings are. And if any poet knew her, He would sing of her with falls Used in lovely madrigals. And if any painter drew her, He would paint her unaware With a halo round the hair. And if reader read the poem, He would whisper “You have done a Consecrated little Una.” And a dreamer (did you show him That same picture) would exclaim, “'Tis my angel, with a name!” And a stranger, when he sees her In the street even, smileth stilly, Just as you would at a lily. And all voices that address her, Soften, sleeken every word, As if speaking to a bird. And all fancies yearn to cover The hard earth, whereon she passes, With the thymy-scented grasses. And all hearts do pray “God love her!” Ay and always, in good sooth, We may all be sure He doth. SLEEPING AND WATCHING. I. Sleep on, baby, on the floor, Tired of all the playing: Sleep with smile the sweeter for That, you dropped away in. On your curls' full roundness stand Golden lights serenely; One cheek, pushed out by the hand Folds the dimple inly: Little head and little foot Heavy laid for pleasure, Underneath the lids half shut Slants the shining azure. Open-soul in noonday sun, So you lie and slumber: Nothing evil having done, Nothing can encumber. II. I, who cannot sleep as well, Shall I sigh to view you? Or sigh further to foretell All that may undo you? Nay, keep smiling, little child, Ere the sorrow neareth: I will smile too! patience mild Pleasure's token weareth. Nay, keep sleeping before loss: I shall sleep though losing! As by cradle, so by cross, Sure is the reposing. III. And God knows who sees us twain, Child at childish leisure, I am near as tired of pain As you seem of pleasure. Very soon too, by His grace Gently wrapt around me, Shall I show as calm a face, Shall I sleep as soundly. Differing in this, that you Clasp your playthings, sleeping, While my hand shall drop the few Given to my keeping: Differing in this, that I Sleeping shall be colder, And in waking presently, Brighter to beholder: Differing in this beside— (Sleeper, have you heard me? Do you move, and open wide Eyes of wonder toward me?)— That while you I thus recall From your sleep, I solely, Me from mine an angel shall, With reveillie holy. WINE OF CYPRUS. GIVEN TO ME BY H. S. BOYD, AUTHOR OF “SELECT PASSAGES FROM THE GREEK FATHERS,” ETC., TO WHOM THESE STANZAS ARE ADDRESSED. I If old Bacchus were the speaker, He would tell you with a sigh Of the Cyprus in this beaker I am sipping like a fly,— Like a fly or gnat on Ida At the hour of goblet-pledge, By queen Juno brushed aside, a Full white arm-sweep, from the edge. II Sooth, the drinking should be ampler When the drink is so divine, And some deep-mouthed Greek exemplar Would become your Cyprus wine: Cyclops' mouth might plunge aright in, While his one eye overleered, Nor too large were mouth of Titan Drinking rivers down his beard. III Pan might dip his head so deep in, That his ears alone pricked out, Fauns around him pressing, leaping, Each one pointing to his throat: While the Naiads, like Bacchantes, Wild, with urns thrown out to waste, Cry, “O earth, that thou wouldst grant us Springs to keep, of such a taste!” IV But for me, I am not worthy After gods and Greeks to drink, And my lips are pale and earthy To go bathing from this brink: Since you heard them speak the last time, They have faded from their blooms, And the laughter of my pastime Has learnt silence at the tombs. V Ah, my friend! the antique drinkers Crowned the cup and crowned the brow. Can I answer the old thinkers In the forms they thought of, now? Who will fetch from garden-closes Some new garlands while I speak, That the forehead, crowned with roses, May strike scarlet down the cheek? VI Do not mock me! with my mortal Suits no wreath again, indeed; I am sad-voiced as the turtle Which Anacreon used to feed: Yet as that same bird demurely Wet her beak in cup of his, So, without a garland, surely I may touch the brim of this. VII Go,—let others praise the Chian! This is soft as Muses' string, This is tawny as Rhea's lion, This is rapid as his spring, Bright as Paphia's eyes e'er met us, Light as ever trod her feet; And the brown bees of Hymettus Make their honey not so sweet. VIII Very copious are my praises, Though I sip it like a fly! Ah—but, sipping,—times and places Change before me suddenly: As Ulysses' old libation Drew the ghosts from every part, So your Cyprus wine, dear Grecian, Stirs the Hades of my heart. IX And I think of those long mornings Which my thought goes far to seek, When, betwixt the folio's turnings, Solemn flowed the rhythmic Greek: Past the pane the mountain spreading, Swept the sheep's-bell's tinkling noise, While a girlish voice was reading, Somewhat low for ??'s and ??'s. X Then, what golden hours were for us! While we sat together there, How the white vests of the chorus Seemed to wave up a live air! How the cothurns trod majestic Down the deep iambic lines, And the rolling anapæstic Curled like vapour over shrines! XI Oh, our Æschylus, the thunderous, How he drove the bolted breath Through the cloud, to wedge it ponderous In the gnarlèd oak beneath! Oh, our Sophocles, the royal, Who was born to monarch's place, And who made the whole world loyal Less by kingly power than grace! XII Our Euripides, the human, With his droppings of warm tears, And his touches of things common Till they rose to touch the spheres! Our Theocritus, our Bion, And our Pindar's shining goals!— These were cup-bearers undying Of the wine that's meant for souls. XIII And my Plato, the divine one, If men know the gods aright By their motions as they shine on With a glorious trail of light! And your noble Christian bishops, Who mouthed grandly the last Greek! Though the sponges on their hyssops Were distent with wine—too weak. XIV Yet, your Chrysostom, you praised him As a liberal mouth of gold; And your Basil, you upraised him To the height of speakers old: And we both praised Heliodorus For his secret of pure lies,— Who forged first his linkèd stories In the heat of ladies' eyes. XV And we both praised your Synesius For the fire shot up his odes, Though the Church was scarce propitious As he whistled dogs and gods. And we both praised Nazianzen For the fervid heart and speech: Only I eschewed his glancing At the lyre hung out of reach. XVI Do you mind that deed of Atè Which you bound me to so fast,— Reading “De Virginitate,” From the first line to the last? How I said at ending, solemn As I turned and looked at you, That Saint Simeon on the column Had had somewhat less to do? XVII For we sometimes gently wrangled, Very gently, be it said, Since our thoughts were disentangled By no breaking of the thread! And I charged you with extortions On the nobler fames of old— Ay, and sometimes thought your Porsons Stained the purple they would fold. XVIII For the rest—a mystic moaning Kept Cassandra at the gate, With wild eyes the vision shone in, And wide nostrils scenting fate. And Prometheus, bound in passion By brute Force to the blind stone, Showed us looks of invocation Turned to ocean and the sun. XIX And Medea we saw burning At her nature's planted stake: And proud Œdipus fate-scorning While the cloud came on to break— While the cloud came on slow, slower, Till he stood discrowned, resigned!— But the reader's voice dropped lower When the poet called him blind. XX Ah, my gossip! you were older, And more learned, and a man! Yet that shadow, the enfolder Of your quiet eyelids, ran Both our spirits to one level; And I turned from hill and lea And the summer-sun's green revel, To your eyes that could not see. XXI Now Christ bless you with the one light Which goes shining night and day! May the flowers which grow in sunlight Shed their fragrance in your way! Is it not right to remember All your kindness, friend of mine, When we two sat in the chamber, And the poets poured us wine? XXII So, to come back to the drinking Of this Cyprus,—it is well, But those memories, to my thinking, Make a better œnomel; And whoever be the speaker, None can murmur with a sigh That, in drinking from that beaker, I am sipping like a fly. THE ROMANCE OF THE SWAN'S NEST. “So the dreams depart, So the fading phantoms flee, And the sharp reality Now must act its part.” Westwood's Beads from a Rosary. I Little Ellie sits alone 'Mid the beeches of a meadow, By a stream-side on the grass, And the trees are showering down Doubles of their leaves in shadow On her shining hair and face. II She has thrown her bonnet by, And her feet she has been dipping In the shallow water's flow: Now she holds them nakedly In her hands, all sleek and dripping, While she rocketh to and fro. III Little Ellie sits alone, And the smile she softly uses Fills the silence like a speech, While she thinks what shall be done, And the sweetest pleasure chooses For her future within reach. IV Little Ellie in her smile Chooses—“I will have a lover Riding on a steed of steeds: He shall love me without guile, And to him I will discover The swan's nest among the reeds. V “And the steed shall be red-roan, And the lover shall be noble, With an eye that takes the breath: And the lute he plays upon Shall strike ladies into trouble, As his sword strikes men to death. VI “And the steed it shall be shod All in silver, housed in azure, And the mane shall swim the wind; And the hoofs along the sod Shall flash onward and keep measure, Till the shepherds look behind. VII “But my lover will not prize All the glory that he rides in, When he gazes in my face: He will say, ‘O Love, thine eyes Build the shrine my soul abides in, And I kneel here for thy grace!’ VIII “Then, ay, then he shall kneel low, With the red-roan steed anear him Which shall seem to understand, Till I answer, ‘Rise and go! For the world must love and fear him Whom I gift with heart and hand.’ IX “Then he will arise so pale, I shall feel my own lips tremble With a yes I must not say, Nathles maiden-brave, ‘Farewell,’ I will utter, and dissemble— ‘Light to-morrow with to-day!’ X “Then he'll ride among the hills To the wide world past the river, There to put away all wrong; To make straight distorted wills, And to empty the broad quiver Which the wicked bear along. XI “Three times shall a young foot-page Swim the stream and climb the mountain And kneel down beside my feet— ‘Lo, my master sends this gage, Lady, for thy pity's counting! What wilt thou exchange for it?’ XII “And the first time I will send A white rosebud for a guerdon, And the second time, a glove; But the third time—I may bend From my pride, and answer—‘Pardon If he comes to take my love.’ XIII “Then the young foot-page will run, Then my lover will ride faster, Till he kneeleth at my knee: ‘I am a duke's eldest son, Thousand serfs do call me master, But, O Love, I love but thee!’ XIV “He will kiss me on the mouth Then, and lead me as a lover Through the crowds that praise his deeds; And, when soul-tied by one troth, Unto him I will discover That swan's nest among the reeds.” XV Little Ellie, with her smile Not yet ended, rose up gaily, Tied the bonnet, donned the shoe, And went homeward, round a mile, Just to see, as she did daily, What more eggs were with the two. XVI Pushing through the elm-tree copse, Winding up the stream, light-hearted, Where the osier pathway leads, Past the boughs she stoops—and stops. Lo, the wild swan had deserted, And a rat had gnawed the reeds! XVII Ellie went home sad and slow. If she found the lover ever, With his red-roan steed of steeds, Sooth I know not; but I know She could never show him—never, That swan's nest among the reeds! LESSONS FROM THE GORSE. “To win the secret of a weed's plain heart.” —Lowell. I Mountain gorses, ever-golden, Cankered not the whole year long! Do ye teach us to be strong, Howsoever pricked and holden Like your thorny blooms, and so Trodden on by rain and snow, Up the hill-side of this life, as bleak as where ye grow? II Mountain blossoms, shining blossoms, Do ye teach us to be glad When no summer can be had, Blooming in our inward bosoms? Ye, whom God preserveth still, Set as lights upon a hill, Tokens to the wintry earth that Beauty liveth still! III Mountain gorses, do ye teach us From that academic chair Canopied with azure air, That the wisest word man reaches Is the humblest he can speak? Ye, who live on mountain peak, Yet live low along the ground, beside the grasses meek! IV Mountain gorses, since Linnæus Knelt beside you on the sod, For your beauty thanking God,— For your teaching, ye should see us Bowing in prostration new! Whence arisen,—if one or two Drops be on our cheeks—O world, they are not tears but dew. THE DEAD PAN. Excited by Schiller's “Götter Griechenlands,” and partly founded on a well-known tradition mentioned in a treatise of Plutarch (“De Oraculorum Defectu”), according to which, at the hour of the Saviour's agony, a cry of “Great Pan is dead!” swept across the waves in the hearing of certain mariners, —and the oracles ceased. It is in all veneration to the memory of the deathless Schiller that I oppose a doctrine still more dishonouring to poetry than to Christianity. As Mr. Kenyon's graceful and harmonious paraphrase of the German poem was the first occasion of the turning of my thoughts in this direction, I take advantage of the pretence to indulge my feelings (which overflow on other grounds) by inscribing my lyric to that dear friend and relative, with the earnestness of appreciating esteem as well as of affectionate gratitude. —1844. I Gods of Hellas, gods of Hellas, Can ye listen in your silence? Can your mystic voices tell us Where ye hide? In floating islands, With a wind that evermore Keeps you out of sight of shore? Pan, Pan is dead. II In what revels are ye sunken In old Æthiopia? Have the Pygmies made you drunken, Bathing in mandragora Your divine pale lips that shiver Like the lotus in the river? Pan, Pan is dead. III Do ye sit there still in slumber, In gigantic Alpine rows? The black poppies out of number Nodding, dripping from your brows To the red lees of your wine, And so kept alive and fine? Pan, Pan is dead. IV Or lie crushed your stagnant corses Where the silver spheres roll on, Stung to life by centric forces Thrown like rays out from the sun?— While the smoke of your old altars Is the shroud that round you welters? Great Pan is dead. V “Gods of Hellas, gods of Hellas” Said the old Hellenic tongue,— Said the hero-oaths, as well as Poets' songs the sweetest sung: Have ye grown deaf in a day? Can ye speak not yea or nay, Since Pan is dead? VI Do ye leave your rivers flowing All alone, O Naiades, While your drénchèd locks dry slow in This cold feeble sun and breeze? Not a word the Naiads say, Though the rivers run for aye; For Pan is dead. VII From the gloaming of the oak-wood, O ye Dryads, could ye flee? At the rushing thunderstroke, would No sob tremble through the tree? Not a word the Dryads say, Though the forests wave for aye; For Pan is dead. VIII Have ye left the mountain places, Oreads wild, for other tryst? Shall we see no sudden faces Strike a glory through the mist? Not a sound the silence thrills Of the everlasting hills: Pan, Pan is dead. IX O twelve gods of Plato's vision, Crowned to starry wanderings, With your chariots in procession And your silver clash of wings! Very pale ye seem to rise, Ghosts of Grecian deities, Now Pan is dead! X Jove, that right hand is unloaded Whence the thunder did prevail, While in idiocy of godhead Thou art staring the stars pale! And thine eagle, blind and old, Roughs his feathers in the cold. Pan, Pan is dead. XI Where, O Juno, is the glory Of thy regal look and tread? Will they lay, for evermore, thee On thy dim, strait, golden bed? Will thy queendom all lie hid Meekly under either lid? Pan, Pan is dead XII Ha, Apollo! floats his golden Hair all mist-like where he stands, While the Muses hang enfolding Knee and foot with faint wild hands? 'Neath the clanging of thy bow, Niobe looked lost as thou! Pan, Pan is dead. XIII Shall the casque with its brown iron Pallas' broad blue eyes eclipse, And no hero take inspiring From the god-Greek of her lips? 'Neath her olive dost thou sit, Mars the mighty, cursing it? Pan, Pan is dead. XIV Bacchus, Bacchus! on the panther He swoons, bound with his own vines; And his Mænads slowly saunter, Head aside, among the pines, While they murmur dreamingly “Evohe!—ah—evohe!— Ah, Pan is dead!” XV Neptune lies beside the trident, Dull and senseless as a stone; And old Pluto deaf and silent Is cast out into the sun: Ceres smileth stern thereat, “We all now are desolate— Now Pan is dead.” XVI Aphrodite! dead and driven As thy native foam thou art; With the cestus long done heaving On the white calm of thine heart! Ai Adonis! at that shriek Not a tear runs down her cheek— Pan, Pan is dead. XVII And the Loves, we used to know from One another, huddled lie, Frore as taken in a snow-storm, Close beside her tenderly; As if each had weakly tried Once to kiss her as he died. Pan, Pan is dead. XVIII What, and Hermes? Time enthralleth All thy cunning, Hermes, thus, And the ivy blindly crawleth Round thy brave caduceus? Hast thou no new message for us, Full of thunder and Jove-glories? Nay, Pan is dead. XIX Crownèd Cybele's great turret Rocks and crumbles on her head; Roar the lions of her chariot Toward the wilderness, unfed: Scornful children are not mute,— “Mother, mother, walk afoot, Since Pan is dead!” XX In the fiery-hearted centre Of the solemn universe, Ancient Vesta,—who could enter To consume thee with this curse? Drop thy grey chin on thy knee, O thou palsied Mystery! For Pan is dead. XXI Gods, we vainly do adjure you,— Ye return nor voice nor sign! Not a votary could secure you Even a grave for your Divine: Not a grave, to show thereby Here these grey old gods do lie. Pan, Pan is dead. XXII Even that Greece who took your wages Calls the obolus outworn; And the hoarse, deep-throated ages Laugh your godships unto scorn: And the poets do disclaim you, Or grow colder if they name you— And Pan is dead. XXIII Gods bereavèd, gods belated, With your purples rent asunder! Gods discrowned and desecrated, Disinherited of thunder! Now, the goats may climb and crop The soft grass on Ida's top— Now Pan is dead. XXIV Calm, of old, the bark went onward, When a cry more loud than wind Rose up, deepened, and swept sunward From the pilèd Dark behind; And the sun shrank and grew pale, Breathed against by the great wail— “Pan, Pan is dead.” XXV And the rowers from the benches Fell, each shuddering on his face, While departing Influences Struck a cold back through the place; And the shadow of the ship Reeled along the passive deep— “Pan, Pan is dead.” XXVI And that dismal cry rose slowly And sank slowly through the air, Full of spirit's melancholy And eternity's despair! And they heard the words it said— Pan is dead—Great Pan is dead— Pan, Pan is dead. XXVII 'Twas the hour when One in Sion Hung for love's sake on a cross; When His brow was chill with dying And His soul was faint with loss; When His priestly blood dropped downward And His kingly eyes looked throneward— Then, Pan was dead. XXVIII By the love, He stood alone in, His sole Godhead rose complete, And the false gods fell down moaning Each from off his golden seat; All the false gods with a cry Rendered up their deity— Pan, Pan was dead. XXIX Wailing wide across the islands, They rent, vest-like, their Divine; And a darkness and a silence Quenched the light of every shrine; And Dodona's oak swang lonely Henceforth, to the tempest only: Pan, Pan was dead. XXX Pythia staggered, feeling o'er her Her lost god's forsaking look; Straight her eyeballs filmed with horror And her crispy fillets shook And her lips gasped, through their foam, For a word that did not come. Pan, Pan was dead. XXXI O ye vain false gods of Hellas, Ye are silent evermore! And I dash down this old chalice Whence libations ran of yore. See, the wine crawls in the dust Wormlike—as your glories must, Since Pan is dead. XXXII Get to dust, as common mortals, By a common doom and track! Let no Schiller from the portals Of that Hades call you back, Or instruct us to weep all At your antique funeral. Pan, Pan is dead. XXXIII By your beauty, which confesses Some chief Beauty conquering you,— By our grand heroic guesses Through your falsehood at the True,— We will weep not! earth shall roll Heir to each god's aureole— And Pan is dead. XXXIV Earth outgrows the mythic fancies Sung beside her in her youth, And those debonair romances Sound but dull beside the truth. Phœbus' chariot-course is run: Look up, poets, to the sun! Pan, Pan is dead. XXXV Christ hath sent us down the angels; And the whole earth and the skies Are illumed by altar-candles Lit for blessèd mysteries; And a Priest's hand through creation Waveth calm and consecration: And Pan is dead. XXXVI Truth is fair: should we forgo it? Can we sigh right for a wrong? God Himself is the best Poet, And the Real is His song. Sing His truth out fair and full, And secure His beautiful! Let Pan be dead! XXXVII Truth is large: our aspiration Scarce embraces half we be. Shame, to stand in His creation And doubt truth's sufficiency!— To think God's song unexcelling The poor tales of our own telling— When Pan is dead! XXXVIII What is true and just and honest, What is lovely, what is pure, All of praise that hath admonisht, All of virtue,—shall endure; These are themes for poets' uses, Stirring nobler than the Muses, Ere Pan was dead. XXXIX O brave poets, keep back nothing, Nor mix falsehood with the whole! Look up Godward; speak the truth in Worthy song from earnest soul: Hold, in high poetic duty, Truest Truth the fairest Beauty! Pan, Pan is dead.</field>

I I stand on the mark beside the shore Of the first white pilgrim's bended knee, Where exile turned to ancestor, And God was thanked for liberty. I have run through the night, my skin is as dark, I bend my knee down on this mark: I look on the sky and the sea. II O pilgrim-souls, I speak to you! I see you come proud and slow From the land of the spirits pale as dew And round me and round me ye go. O pilgrims, I have gasped and run All night long from the whips of one Who in your names works sin and woe! III And thus I thought that I would come And kneel here where ye knelt before, And feel your souls around me hum In undertone to the ocean's roar; And lift my black face, my black hand, Here, in your names, to curse this land Ye blessed in freedom's, evermore. IV I am black, I am black, And yet God made me, they say: But if He did so, smiling back He must have cast His work away Under the feet of His white creatures, With a look of scorn, that the dusky features Might be trodden again to clay. V And yet He has made dark things To be glad and merry as light: There's a little dark bird sits and sings, There's a dark stream ripples out of sight, And the dark frogs chant in the safe morass, And the sweetest stars are made to pass O'er the face of the darkest night. VI But we who are dark, we are dark! Ah God, we have no stars! About our souls in care and cark Our blackness shuts like prison-bars: The poor souls crouch so far behind That never a comfort can they find By reaching through the prison-bars. VII Indeed we live beneath the sky, That great smooth Hand of God stretched out On all His children fatherly, To save them from the dread and doubt Which would be if, from this low place, All opened straight up to His face Into the grand eternity. VIII And still God's sunshine and His frost, They make us hot, they make us cold, As if we were not black and lost; And the beasts and birds, in wood and fold, Do fear and take us for very men: Could the whip-poor-will or the cat of the glen Look into my eyes and be bold? IX I am black, I am black! But, once, I laughed in girlish glee, For one of my colour stood in the track Where the drivers drove, and looked at me, And tender and full was the look he gave— Could a slave look so at another slave?— I look at the sky and the sea. X And from that hour our spirits grew As free as if unsold, unbought: Oh, strong enough, since we were two, To conquer the world, we thought. The drivers drove us day by day; We did not mind, we went one way, And no better a freedom sought. XI In the sunny ground between the canes, He said “I love you” as he passed; When the shingle-roof rang sharp with the rains, I heard how he vowed it fast: While others shook he smiled in the hut, As he carved me a bowl of the cocoa-nut Through the roar of the hurricanes. XII I sang his name instead of a song, Over and over I sang his name, Upward and downward I drew it along My various notes,—the same, the same! I sang it low, that the slave-girls near Might never guess, from aught they could hear, It was only a name—a name. XIII I look on the sky and the sea. We were two to love, and two to pray: Yes, two, O God, who cried to Thee, Though nothing didst Thou say! Coldly Thou sat'st behind the sun: And now I cry who am but one, Thou wilt not speak to-day. XIV We were black, we were black, We had no claim to love and bliss, What marvel if each went to wrack? They wrung my cold hands out of his, They dragged him—where? I crawled to touch His blood's mark in the dust . . . not much, Ye pilgrim-souls, though plain as this! XV Wrong, followed by a deeper wrong! Mere grief's too good for such as I: So the white men brought the shame ere long To strangle the sob of my agony. They would not leave me for my dull Wet eyes!—it was too merciful To let me weep pure tears and die. XVI I am black, I am black! I wore a child upon my breast, An amulet that hung too slack, And, in my unrest, could not rest: Thus we went moaning, child and mother, One to another, one to another, Until all ended for the best. XVII For hark! I will tell you low, low, I am black, you see,— And the babe who lay on my bosom so, Was far too white, too white for me; As white as the ladies who scorned to pray Beside me at church but yesterday, Though my tears had washed a place for my knee. XVIII My own, own child! I could not bear To look in his face, it was so white; I covered him up with a kerchief there, I covered his face in close and tight: And he moaned and struggled, as well might be, For the white child wanted his liberty— Ha, ha! he wanted the master-right. XIX He moaned and beat with his head and feet, His little feet that never grew; He struck them out, as it was meet, Against my heart to break it through: I might have sung and made him mild, But I dared not sing to the white-faced child The only song I knew. XX I pulled the kerchief very close: He could not see the sun, I swear, More, then, alive, than now he does From between the roots of the mango . . . where? I know where. Close! A child and mother Do wrong to look at one another When one is black and one is fair. XXI Why, in that single glance I had Of my child's face, . . . I tell you all, I saw a look that made me mad! The master's look, that used to fall On my soul like his lash . . . or worse! And so, to save it from my curse, I twisted it round in my shawl. XXII And he moaned and trembled from foot to head, He shivered from head to foot; Till after a time, he lay instead Too suddenly still and mute. I felt, beside, a stiffening cold: I dared to lift up just a fold, As in lifting a leaf of the mango-fruit. XXIII But my fruit . . . ha, ha!—there, had been (I laugh to think on't at this hour!) Your fine white angels (who have seen Nearest the secret of God's power) And plucked my fruit to make them wine, And sucked the soul of that child of mine As the humming-bird sucks the soul of the flower. XXIV Ha, ha, the trick of the angels white! They freed the white child's spirit so. I said not a word, but day and night I carried the body to and fro, And it lay on my heart like a stone, as chill. —The sun may shine out as much as he will: I am cold, though it happened a month ago. XXV From the white man's house, and the black man's hut, I carried the little body on; The forest's arms did round us shut, And silence through the trees did run: They asked no question as I went, They stood too high for astonishment, They could see God sit on His throne. XXVI My little body, kerchiefed fast, I bore it on through the forest, on; And when I felt it was tired at last, I scooped a hole beneath the moon: Through the forest-tops the angels far, With a white sharp finger from every star, Did point and mock at what was done. XXVII Yet when it was all done aright,— Earth, 'twixt me and my baby, strewed,— All, changed to black earth,—nothing white,— A dark child in the dark!—ensued Some comfort, and my heart grew young; I sate down smiling there and sung The song I learnt in my maidenhood. XXVIII And thus we two were reconciled, The white child and black mother, thus; For as I sang it soft and wild, The same song, more melodious, Rose from the grave whereon I sate: It was the dead child singing that, To join the souls of both of us. XXIX I look on the sea and the sky. Where the pilgrims' ships first anchored lay The free sun rideth gloriously, But the pilgrim-ghosts have slid away Through the earliest streaks of the morn: My face is black, but it glares with a scorn Which they dare not meet by day. XXX Ha!—in their stead, their hunter sons! Ha, ha! they are on me—they hunt in a ring! Keep off! I brave you all at once, I throw off your eyes like snakes that sting! You have killed the black eagle at nest, I think: Did you ever stand still in your triumph, and shrink From the stroke of her wounded wing? XXXI (Man, drop that stone you dared to lift!—) I wish you who stand there five abreast, Each, for his own wife's joy and gift, A little corpse as safely at rest As mine in the mangoes! Yes, but she May keep live babies on her knee, And sing the song she likes the best. XXXII I am not mad: I am black. I see you staring in my face— I know you staring, shrinking back, Ye are born of the Washington-race, And this land is the free America, And this mark on my wrist—(I prove what I say) Ropes tied me up here to the flogging-place. XXXIII You think I shrieked then? Not a sound! I hung, as a gourd hangs in the sun; I only cursed them all around As softly as I might have done My very own child: from these sands Up to the mountains, lift your hands, O slaves, and end what I begun! XXXIV Whips, curses; these must answer those! For in this Union you have set Two kinds of men in adverse rows, Each loathing each; and all forget The seven wounds in Christ's body fair, While He sees gaping everywhere Our countless wounds that pay no debt. XXXV Our wounds are different. Your white men Are, after all, not gods indeed, Nor able to make Christs again Do good with bleeding. We who bleed (Stand off!) we help not in our loss! We are too heavy for our cross, And fall and crush you and your seed. XXXVI I fall, I swoon! I look at the sky. The clouds are breaking on my brain; I am floated along, as if I should die Of liberty's exquisite pain. In the name of the white child waiting for me In the death-dark where we may kiss and agree, White men, I leave you all curse-free In my broken heart's disdain! HECTOR IN THE GARDEN. I Nine years old! The first of any Seem the happiest years that come: Yet when I was nine, I said No such word! I thought instead That the Greeks had used as many In besieging Ilium. II Nine green years had scarcely brought me To my childhood's haunted spring; I had life, like flowers and bees, In betwixt the country trees, And the sun the pleasure taught me Which he teacheth every thing. III If the rain fell, there was sorrow: Little head leant on the pane, Little finger drawing down it The long trailing drops upon it, And the “Rain, rain, come to-morrow,” Said for charm against the rain. IV Such a charm was right Canidian, Though you meet it with a jeer! If I said it long enough, Then the rain hummed dimly off, And the thrush with his pure Lydian Was left only to the ear; V And the sun and I together Went a-rushing out of doors: We our tender spirits drew Over hill and dale in view, Glimmering hither, glimmering thither In the footsteps of the showers. VI Underneath the chestnuts dripping, Through the grasses wet and fair, Straight I sought my garden-ground With the laurel on the mound, And the pear-tree oversweeping A side-shadow of green air. VII In the garden lay supinely A huge giant wrought of spade! Arms and legs were stretched at length In a passive giant strength,— The fine meadow turf, cut finely, Round them laid and interlaid. VIII Call him Hector, son of Priam! Such his title and degree. With my rake I smoothed his brow, Both his cheeks I weeded through, But a rhymer such as I am, Scarce can sing his dignity. IX Eyes of gentianellas azure, Staring, winking at the skies: Nose of gillyflowers and box; Scented grasses put for locks, Which a little breeze at pleasure Set a-waving round his eyes: X Brazen helm of daffodillies, With a glitter toward the light; Purple violets for the mouth, Breathing perfumes west and south; And a sword of flashing lilies, Holden ready for the fight: XI And a breastplate made of daisies, Closely fitting, leaf on leaf; Periwinkles interlaced Drawn for belt about the waist; While the brown bees, humming praises, Shot their arrows round the chief. XII And who knows (I sometimes wondered) If the disembodied soul Of old Hector, once of Troy, Might not take a dreary joy Here to enter—if it thundered, Rolling up the thunder-roll? XIII Rolling this way from Troy-ruin, In this body rude and rife Just to enter, and take rest 'Neath the daisies of the breast— They, with tender roots, renewing His heroic heart to life? XIV Who could know? I sometimes started At a motion or a sound! Did his mouth speak—naming Troy With an ??????????? Did the pulse of the Strong-hearted Make the daisies tremble round? XV It was hard to answer, often: But the birds sang in the tree, But the little birds sang bold In the pear-tree green and old, And my terror seemed to soften Through the courage of their glee. XVI Oh, the birds, the tree, the ruddy A d white blossoms sleek with rain! Oh, my garden rich with pansies! Oh, my childhood's bright romances! All revive, like Hector's body, And I see them stir again. XVII And despite life's changes, chances, And despite the deathbell's toll. They press on me in full seeming Help, some angel! stay this dreaming! As the birds sang in the branches, Sing God's patience through my soul! XVIII That no dreamer, no neglecter Of the present's work unsped, I may wake up and he doing, Life's heroic ends pursuing, Though my past is dead as Hector, And though Hector is twice dead. SONNETS. FLUSH OR FAUNUS. You see this dog; it was but yesterday I mused forgetful of his presence here, Till thought on thought drew downward tear on tear: When from the pillow where wet-cheeked I lay, A head as hairy as Faunus thrust its way Right sudden against my face, two golden-clear Great eyes astonished mine, a drooping ear Did flap me on either cheek to dry the spray! I started first as some Arcadian Amazed by goatly god in twilight grove: But as the bearded vision closelier ran My tears off, I knew Flush, and rose above Surprise and sadness,—thanking the true Pan Who by low creatures leads to heights of love. FINITE AND INFINITE. The wind sounds only in opposing straits, The sea, beside the shore; man's spirit rends Its quiet only up against the ends Of wants and oppositions, loves and hates, Where, worked and worn by passionate debates, And losing by the loss it apprehends, The flesh rocks round and every breath it sends Is ravelled to a sigh. All tortured states Suppose a straitened place. Jehovah Lord, Make room for rest, around me! out of sight Now float me of the vexing land abhorred, Till in deep calms of space my soul may right Her nature, shoot large sail on lengthening cord, And rush exultant on the Infinite. TWO SKETCHES. I. H. B. The shadow of her face upon the wall May take your memory to the perfect Greek, But when you front her, you would call the cheek Too full, sir, for your models, if withal That bloom it wears could leave you critical, And that smile reaching toward the rosy streak; For one who smiles so has no need to speak To lead your thoughts along, as steed to stall. A smile that turns the sunny side o' the heart On all the world, as if herself did win By what she lavished on an open mart! Let no man call the liberal sweetness, sin,— For friends may whisper as they stand apart, “Methinks there's still some warmer place within.” II. A. B. Her azure eyes, dark lashes hold in fee; Her fair superfluous ringlets without check Drop after one another down her neck, As many to each cheek as you might see Green leaves to a wild rose; this sign outwardly, And a like woman-covering seems to deck Her inner nature, for she will not fleck World's sunshine with a finger. Sympathy Must call her in Love's name! and then, I know, She rises up, and brightens as she should, And lights her smile for comfort, and is slow In nothing of high-hearted fortitude. To smell this flower, come near it! such can grow In that sole garden where Christ's brow dropped blood. MOUNTAINEER AND POET. The simple goatherd between Alp and sky, Seeing his shadow, in that awful tryst, Dilated to a giant's on the mist, Esteems not his own stature larger by The apparent image, but more patiently Strikes his staff down beneath his clenching fist, While the snow-mountains lift their amethyst And sapphire crowns of splendour, far and nigh, Into the air around him. Learn from hence Meek morals, all ye poets that pursue Your way still onward up to eminence! Ye are not great because creation drew Large revelations round your earliest sense, Nor bright because God's glory shines for you. THE POET. The poet hath the child's sight in his breast And sees all new. What oftenest he has viewed He views with the first glory. Fair and good Pall never on him, at the fairest, best, But stand before him holy and undressed In week-day false conventions, such as would Drag other men down from the altitude Of primal types, too early dispossessed. Why, God would tire of all His heavens, as soon As thou, O godlike, childlike poet, didst Of daily and nightly sights of sun and moon! And therefore hath He set thee in the midst Where men may hear thy wonder's ceaseless tune And praise His world for ever, as thou bidst. HIRAM POWERS' “GREEK SLAVE.” They say Ideal beauty cannot enter The house of anguish. On the threshold stands An alien Image with enshackled hands, Called the Greek Slave! as if the artist meant her (That passionless perfection which he lent her, Shadowed not darkened where the sill expands) To so confront man's crimes in different lands With man's ideal sense. Pierce to the centre, Art's fiery finger, and break up ere long The serfdom of this world. Appeal, fair stone, From God's pure heights of beauty against man's wrong! Catch up in thy divine face, not alone East griefs but west, and strike and shame the strong, By thunders of white silence, overthrown. LIFE. Each creature holds an insular point in space; Yet what man stirs a finger, breathes a sound, But all the multitudinous beings round In all the countless worlds with time and place For their conditions, down to the central base, Thrill, haply, in vibration and rebound, Life answering life across the vast profound, In full antiphony, by a common grace? I think this sudden joyaunce which illumes A child's mouth sleeping, unaware may run From some soul newly loosened from earth's tombs: I think this passionate sigh, which half-begun I stifle back, may reach and stir the plumes Of God's calm angel standing in the sun. LOVE. We cannot live, except thus mutually We alternate, aware or unaware, The reflex act of life: and when we bear Our virtue outward most impulsively, Most full of invocation, and to be Most instantly compellant, certes there We live most life, whoever breathes most air And counts his dying years by sun and sea. But when a soul, by choice and conscience, doth Throw out her full force on another soul, The conscience and the concentration both Make mere life, Love. For Life in perfect whole And aim consummated, is Love in sooth, As Nature's magnet-heat rounds pole with pole. HEAVEN AND EARTH. “And there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour.” God, who with thunders and great voices kept Beneath Thy throne, and stars most silver-paced Along the inferior gyres, and open-faced Melodious angels round, canst intercept Music with music,—yet, at will, has swept All back, all back (said he in Patmos placed,) To fill the heavens with silence of the waste Which lasted half an hour! Lo, I who have wept All day and night, beseech Thee by my tears, And by that dread response of curse and groan Men alternate across these hemispheres, Vouchsafe us such a half-hour's hush alone, In compensation for our stormy years: As heaven has paused from song, let earth from moan! THE PROSPECT. Methinks we do as fretful children do, Leaning their faces on the window-pane To sigh the glass dim with their own breath's stain, And shut the sky and landscape from their view: And thus, alas, since God the maker drew A mystic separation 'twixt those twain,— The life beyond us, and our souls in pain,— We miss the prospect which we are called unto By grief we are fools to use. Be still and strong, O man, my brother! Hold thy sobbing breath, And keep thy soul's large window pure from wrong! That so, as life's appointment issueth, Thy vision may be clear to watch along The sunset consummation-lights of death. HUGH STUART BOYD. To whom was inscribed, in grateful affection, my poem of “Cyprus Wine.” There comes a moment in life when even gratitude and affection turn to pain, as they do now with me. This excellent and learned man, enthusiastic for the good and the beautiful, and one of the most simple and upright of human beings, passed out of his long darkness through death in the summer of 1848; Dr. Adam Clarke's daughter and biographer, Mrs. Smith (happier in this than the absent), fulfilling a doubly filial duty as she sat by the death-bed of her father's friend and hers. HIS BLINDNESS. God would not let the spheric lights accost This God-loved man, and bade the earth stand off With all her beckoning hills whose golden stuff Under the feet of the royal sun is crossed. Yet such things were to him not wholly lost,— Permitted, with his wandering eyes light-proof, To catch fair visions rendered full enough By many a ministrant accomplished ghost,— Still seeing, to sounds of softly-turned book-leaves, Sappho's crown-rose, and Meleager's Spring, And Gregory's starlight on Greek-burnished eves: Till Sensuous and Unsensuous seemed one thing, Viewed from one level,—earth's reapers at the sheaves Scarce plainer than Heaven's angels on the wing. HUGH STUART BOYD. HIS DEATH, 1848. Belovèd friend, who living many years With sightless eyes raised vainly to the sun, Didst learn to keep thy patient soul in tune To visible nature's elemental cheers! God has not caught thee to new hemispheres Because thou wast aweary of this one;— I think thine angel's patience first was done, And that he spake out with celestial tears, “Is it enough, dear God? then lighten so This soul that smiles in darkness!” Steadfast friend, Who never didst my heart or life misknow, Nor either's faults too keenly apprehend,— How can I wonder when I see thee go To join the Dead found faithful to the end? HUGH STUART BOYD. LEGACIES. Three gifts the Dying left me,—Æschylus, And Gregory Nazianzen, and a clock Chiming the gradual hours out like a flock Of stars whose motion is melodious. The books were those I used to read from, thus Assisting my dear teacher's soul to unlock The darkness of his eyes; now, mine they mock, Blinded in turn by tears; now, murmurous Sad echoes of my young voice, years agone Intoning from these leaves the Grecian phrase, Return and choke my utterance. Books, lie down In silence on the shelf there, within gaze; And thou, clock, striking the hour's pulses on, Chime in the day which ends these parting-days! CONFESSIONS. I Face to face in my chamber, my silent chamber, I saw her: God and she and I only, there I sat down to draw her Soul through the clefts of confession: “Speak, I am holding thee fast, As the angel of resurrection shall do it at the last!” “My cup is blood-red With my sin,” she said, “And I pour it out to the bitter lees, As if the angels of judgment stood over me strong at the last, Or as thou wert as these.” II When God smote His hands together, and struck out thy soul as a spark Into the organised glory of things, from deeps of the dark,— Say, didst thou shine, didst thou burn, didst thou honour the power in the form, As the star does at night, or the fire-fly, or even the little ground-worm? “I have sinned,” she said, “For my seed-light shed Has smouldered away from His first decrees. The cypress praiseth the fire-fly, the ground-leaf praiseth the worm; I am viler than these.” III When God on that sin had pity, and did not trample thee straight With His wild rains beating and drenching thy light found inadequate; When He only sent thee the north-wind, a little searching and chill, To quicken thy flame—didst thou kindle and flash to the heights of His will? “I have sinned,” she said, “Unquickened, unspread, My fire dropt down, and I wept on my knees: I only said of His winds of the north as I shrank from their chill, What delight is in these?” IV When God on that sin had pity, and did not meet it as such, But tempered the wind to thy uses, and softened the world to thy touch, At least thou wast moved in thy soul, though unable to prove it afar, Thou couldst carry thy light like a jewel, not giving it out like a star? “I have sinned,” she said, “And not merited The gift He gives, by the grace He sees! The mine-cave praiseth the jewel, the hillside praiseth the star; I am viler than these.” V Then I cried aloud in my passion,—Unthankful and impotent creature, To throw up thy scorn unto God through the rents in thy beggarly nature! If He, the all-giving and loving, is served so unduly, what then Hast thou done to the weak and the false and the changing,—thy fellows of men? “I have loved,” she said, (Words bowing her head As the wind the wet acacia-trees) “I saw God sitting above me, but I . . . I sat among men, And I have loved these.” VI Again with a lifted voice, like a choral trumpet that takes The lowest note of a viol that trembles, and triumphing breaks On the air with it solemn and clear,—“Behold! I have sinned not in this! Where I loved, I have loved much and well,—I have verily loved not amiss. Let the living,” she said, “Inquire of the dead, In the house of the pale-fronted images. My own true dead will answer for me, that I have not loved amiss In my love for all these. VII “The least touch of their hands in the morning, I keep it by day and by night; Their least step on the stair, at the door, still throbs through me, if ever so light; Their least gift, which they left to my childhood, far off in the long-ago years, Is now turned from a toy to a relic, and seen through the crystals of tears. Dig the snow,” she said, “For my churchyard bed, Yet I, as I sleep, shall not fear to freeze, If one only of these my beloveds shall love me with heart-warm tears, As I have loved these! VIII “If I angered any among them, from thenceforth my own life was sore; If I fell by chance from their presence, I clung to their memory more: Their tender I often felt holy, their bitter I sometimes called sweet; And whenever their heart has refused me, I fell down straight at their feet. I have loved,” she said,— “Man is weak, God is dread, Yet the weak man dies with his spirit at ease, Having poured such an unguent of love but once on the Saviour's feet As I lavished for these.” IX Go, I cried, thou hast chosen the Human, and left the Divine! Then, at least, have the Human shared with thee their wild-berry wine? Have they loved back thy love, and when strangers approached thee with blame, Have they covered thy fault with their kisses, and loved thee the same? But she shrunk and said “God, over my head, Must sweep in the wrath of His judgment-seas, If He shall deal with me sinning, but only indeed the same And no gentler than these.” A SABBATH MORNING AT SEA. I The ship went on with solemn face; To meet the darkness on the deep, The solemn ship went onward: I bowed down weary in the place, For parting tears and present sleep Had weighed mine eyelids downward. II Thick sleep which shut all dreams from me, And kept my inner self apart And quiet from emotion, Then brake away and left me free, Made conscious of a human heart Betwixt the heaven and ocean. III The new sight, the new wondrous sight! The waters round me, turbulent, The skies impassive o'er me, Calm in a moonless, sunless light, Half glorified by that intent Of holding the day-glory! IV Two pale thin clouds did stand upon The meeting line of sea and sky, With aspect still and mystic: I think they did foresee the sun, And rested on their prophecy In quietude majestic, V Then flushed to radiance where they stood, Like statues by the open tomb Of shining saints half risen. The sun!—he came up to be viewed, And sky and sea made mighty room To inaugurate the vision. VI I oft had seen the dawnlight run As red wine through the hills, and break Through many a mist's inurning; But, here, no earth profaned the sun: Heaven, ocean, did alone partake The sacrament of morning. VII Away with thoughts fantastical! I would be humble to my worth, Self-guarded as self-doubted: Though here no earthly shadows fall, I, joying, grieving without earth, May desecrate without it. VIII God's sabbath morning sweeps the waves; I would not praise the pageant high Yet miss the dedicature: I, carried toward the sunless graves By force of natural things,—should I Exult in only Nature? IX And could I bear to sit alone 'Mid Nature's fixed benignities, While my warm pulse was moving? Too dark thou art, O glittering sun, Too strait ye are, capacious seas, To satisfy the loving! X It seems a better lot than so, To sit with friends beneath the beech, And feel them dear and dearer; Or follow children as they go In pretty pairs, with softened speech, As the church-bells ring nearer. XI Love me, sweet friends, this sabbath day! The sea sings round me while ye roll Afar the hymn unaltered, And kneel, where once I knelt to pray, And bless me deeper in the soul, Because the voice has faltered. XII And though this sabbath comes to me Without the stolèd minister Or chanting congregation, God's Spirit brings communion, He Who brooded soft on waters drear, Creator on creation. XIII Himself, I think, shall draw me higher Where keep the saints with harp and song An endless sabbath morning, And on that sea commixed with fire Oft drop their eyelids, raised too long To the full Godhead's burning. THE MASK. I I have a smiling face, she said, I have a jest for all I meet, I have a garland for my head And all its flowers are sweet,— And so you call me gay, she said. II Grief taught to me this smile, she said, And Wrong did teach this jesting bold; These flowers were plucked from garden-bed While a death-chime was tolled: And what now will you say?—she said. III Behind no prison-grate, she said, Which slurs the sunshine half a mile, Live captives so uncomforted As souls behind a smile. God's pity let us pray, she said. IV I know my face is bright, she said,— Such brightness dying suns diffuse: I bear upon my forehead shed The sign of what I lose, The ending of my day, she said. V If I dared leave this smile, she said, And take a moan upon my mouth, And tie a cypress round my head, And let my tears run smooth, It were the happier way, she said. VI And since that must not be, she said, I fain your bitter world would leave. How calmly, calmly smile the Dead, Who do not, therefore, grieve! The yea of Heaven is yea, she said. VII But in your bitter world, she said, Face-joy's a costly mask to wear; 'Tis bought with pangs long nourishèd, And rounded to despair: Grief's earnest makes life's play, she said. VIII Ye weep for those who weep? she said— Ah fools! I bid you pass them by. Go, weep for those hearts have bled What time their eyes were dry. Whom sadder can I say? she said CALLS ON THE HEART. I Free Heart, that singest to-day Like a bird on the first green spray, Wilt thou go forth to the world Where the hawk hath his wing unfurled To follow, perhaps, thy way? Where the tamer thine own will bind, And, to make thee sing, will blind, While the little hip grows for the free behind? Heart, wilt thou go? —“No, no! Free hearts are better so.” II The world, thou hast heard it told, Has counted its robber-gold, And the pieces stick to the hand; The world goes riding it fair and grand, While the truth is bought and sold; World-voices east, world-voices west, They call thee, Heart, from thine early rest, “Come hither, come hither and be our guest.” Heart, wilt thou go? —“No, no! Good hearts are calmer so.” III Who calleth thee, Heart? World's Strife, With a golden heft to his knife; World's Mirth, with a finger fine That draws on a board in wine Her blood-red plans of life; World's Gain, with a brow knit down; World's Fame, with a laurel crown Which rustles most as the leaves turn brown: Heart, wilt thou go? —“No, no! Calm hearts are wiser so.” IV Hast heard that Proserpina (Once fooling) was snatched away To partake the dark king's seat, And the tears ran fast on her feet To think how the sun shone yesterday? With her ankles sunken in asphodel She wept for the roses of earth which fell From her lap when the wild car drave to hell. Heart, wilt thou go? —“No, no! Wise hearts are warmer so.” V And what is this place not seen, Where Hearts may hide serene? “'Tis a fair still house well-kept Which humble thoughts have swept And holy prayers made clean. There I sit with Love in the sun, And we two never have done Singing sweeter songs than are guessed by one.” Heart, wilt thou go? —“No, no! Warm hearts are fuller so.” VI O Heart, O Love,—I fear That Love may be kept too near. Has heard, O Heart, that tale, How Love may be false and frail To a Heart once holden dear? —“But this true Love of mine Clings fast as the clinging vine, And mingles pure as the grapes in wine.” Heart, wilt thou go? —“No, no! Full hearts beat higher so.” VII O Heart, O Love, beware! Look up, and boast not there, For who has twirled at the pin? 'Tis the World, between Death and Sin,— The World and the World's Despair! And Death was quickened his pace To the hearth, with a mocking face, Familiar as Love, in Love's own place. Heart, will thou go? “Still, no! High hearts must grieve even so.” VIII The house is waste to-day, The leaf has dropt from the spray, The thorn, prickt through to the song: If summer of doeth no wrong, The winter will, they say. Sing, Heart! What heart replies? In vain we were calm and wise, If the tears unkissed stand on in our eyes. Heart, wilt thou go? —“Ah, no! Grieved hearts must break even so.” IX Howbeit all is not lost. The warm noon ends in frost, And worldly tongues of promise, Like sheep-bells die off from us On the desert hills cloud-crossed: Yet through the silence shall Pierce th edeath-angel's call, And “Come up hither,” recover al. Heart, wilt thou go? —“I go! Broken hearts triumph so.” WISDOM UNAPPLIED. I If I were thou, O butterfly, And poised my purple wing to spy The sweetest flowers that live and die, II I would not waste my strength on those, As thou,—for summer has a close, And pansies bloom not in the snows. III If I were thou, O working bee, And all that honey-gold I see Could delve from roses easily, IV I would not hive it at man's door, As thou,—that heirdom of my store Should make him rich and leave me poor. V If I wre thou, O eagle proud, And screamed the thunder back aloud, And faced the lightning from the cloud, VI I would not build my eyrie-throne, As thou,—upon a crumbling stone Which the next storm may trample down. VII If I were thou, O gallant steed, With pawing hoof and dancing head, And eye outrunning thine own speed, VIII I would not meeken to the rein, As thou,—nor smooth my nostril plain From the glad desert's snort and stain. IX If I were thou, red-breasted bird, With song at shut-up window heard, Like Love's sweet Yes too long deferred, X I would not overstay delight, As thou,—but take a swallow-flight Till the new spring returned to sight. XI While yet I spake, a touch was laid Upon my brow, whose pride did fade As thus, methought, an angel said, XII “If I were thou who sing'st this song, Most wise for others, and most strong In seeing right while doing wrong, XIII “I would not waste my cares, and choose, As thou,—to seek what thou must lose, Such gains as perish in the use. XIV “I would not work where none can win, As thou,—halfway 'twixt grief and sin, But look above and judge within. XV “I would not let my pulse beat high, As thou,—towards fame's regality, Nor yet in love's great jeopardy. XVI “I would not champ the hard cold bit, As thou,—of what the world thinks fit, But take God's freedom, using it. XVII “I would not play earth's winter out, As thou,—but gird my soul about, And live for live past death and doubt. XVIII “Then sing, O singer!—but allow, Beast, fly and bird, called foolish now, Are wise (for all thy scorn) as thou.” HUMAN LIFE'S MYSTERY. I We sow the glebe, we reap the corn, We build the house whre we may rest, And then, at moments, suddenly We look up to the great wide sky, Inquiring wherefore we were born, For earnest or for jest? II The senses folding thick and dark About the stifled soul within, We guess diviner things beyond, And yearn to them with yearning fond; We strike out blindly to a mark Believed in, but not seen. III We vibrate to the pant and thrill Wherewith Eternity has curled In serpent-twine about God's seat: While, freshening upward to His feet, In gradual growth His full-leaved will Expands from world to world. IV And, in the tumult and excess Of act and passion under sun, We sometimes hear—oh, soft and far, As silver star did touch with star, The kiss of Peace and Righteousness Through all things that are done. V God keeps His holy mysteries Just on the outside of man's dream; In diapason slow, we think To hear their pinions rise and sink, While they float pure beneath His eyes, Like swans adown a stream. VI Abstractions, are they, from the forms Of His great beauty?—exaltations From his great glory?—strong previsions Of what we shall be?—intuitions Of what we are—in calms and storms Beyond our peace and passions? VII Things nameless! which, in passing so, Do stroke us with a subtle grace; We say, “Who passes?”—they are dumb; We cannot see them go or come, Their touches fall soft, cold, as snow Upon a blind man's face. VIII Yet, touching so, they draw above Our common thoughts to Heaven's unknown; Our daily joy and pain advance To a divine significance Our human love—O mortal love, That light is not its own! IX And sometimes horror chills our blood To be so near such mystic Things, And we wrap round us for defence Our purple manners, moods of sense— As angels from the face of God Stand hidden in their wings. X And sometimes through life's heavey swound We grope for them, with strangled breath We stretch our hands abroad and try To reach them in our agony; And widen, so, the broad life-wound Soon large enough for death. A CHILD'S THOUGHT OF GOD. I. They say that God lives very high; But if you look above the pines You cannot see our God; and why? II. And if you dig down in the mines You never see Him in the gold; Though from Him all that's glory shines. III. God is so good, He wears a fold Of heaven and earth across His face— Like secrets kept, for love, untold. IV. But still I feel that His embrace Slides down by thrills, through all things made, Through sight and sound of every place: V. As if my tender mother laid On my shut lips her kisses' pressure, Half-waking me at night, and said “Who kissed you through the dark, dear guesser?” THE CLAIM. I. Grief sate upon a rock and sighed one day, (Sighing is all her rest,) “Wellaway, wellaway, ah wellaway!” As ocean beat the stone, did she her breast, “Ah wellaway! ah me! alas, ah me!” Such sighing uttered she. II. A Cloud spake out of heaven, as soft as rain That falls on water,—“Lo, The winds have wandered from me! I remain Alone in the sky-waste, and cannot go To lean my whiteness on the mountain blue Till wanted for more dew. III. “The sun has struck my brain to weary peace, Whereby constrained and pale I spin for him a larger golden fleece Than Jason's, yearning for as full a sail. Sweet Grief, when thou hast sighèd to thy mind, Give me a sigh for wind, IV. “And let it carry me adown the west!” But Love, who pròstrated Lay at Grief's foot, his lifted eyes possessed Of her full image, answered in her stead; “Now nay, now nay! she shall not give away What is my wealth, for any Cloud that flieth: Where Grief makes moan, Love claims his own, And therefore do I lie here night and day, And eke my life out with the breath she sigheth.” A DEAD ROSE. I O Rose, who dares to name thee? No longer roseate now, nor soft nor sweet, But pale and hard and dry as stubble wheat,— Kept seven years in a drawer, thy titles shame thee. II The breeze that used to blow thee Between the hedgerow thorns, and take away An odour up the lane to last all day,— If breathing now, unsweetened would for-go thee. III The sun that used to smite thee, And mix his glory in thy gorgeous urn Till beam appeared to bloom, and flower to burn,— If shining now, with not a hue would light thee. IV The dew that used to wet thee, And, white first, grow incarnadined because It lay upon thee where the crimson was,— If dropping now, would darken where it met thee. V The fly that 'lit upon thee To stretch the tendrils of its tiny feet Along thy leaf's pure edges after heat,— If 'lighting now, would coldly overrun thee. VI The bee that once did suck thee, And build thy perfumed ambers up his hive, And swoon in thee for joy, till scarce alive,— If passing now, would blindly overlook thee. VII The heart doth recognise thee, Alone, alone! the heart doth smell thee sweet. Doth view thee fair, doth judge thee most complete, Perceiving all those changes that disguise thee. VIII Yes, and the heart doth owe thee More love, dead rose, than to any roses bold Which Julia wears at dances, smiling cold:— Lie still upon this heart which breaks below thee! A WOMAN'S SHORTCOMINGS. I She has laughed as softly as if she sighed, She has counted six, and over, Of a purse well filled and a heart well tried— Oh, each a worthy lover! They “give her time;” for her soul must slip Where the world has set the grooving; She will lie to none with her fair red lip: But love seeks truer loving. II She trembles her fan in a sweetness dumb, As her thoughts were beyond recalling, Wiht a glance for one, and a glance for some, From her eyelids rising and falling; Speaks common words with a blushful air, Hears bold words, unreproving; But her silence says—what she never will swear— And love seeks better loving. III Go, lady, lean to the night-guitar And drop a smile to the bringer; Then smile as sweetly, when he is far, At the voice of an in-door singer. Bask tenderly beneath tender eyes; Glance lightly, on their removing; Adn join new vows to old perjuries— But dare not call it loving. IV Unless you can think, when the song is done, No other is soft in the rhythm; Unless you can feel, when left by One, That all men else go with him; Unless you can know, when unpraised by his breath, That your beauty itself wants proving; Unless you can swear “For life, for death!”— Oh, fear to call it loving! V Unless you can muse in a crowd all day On the absent face that fixed you; Unless you can love, as the angels may, With the breadth of heaven betwixt you; Unless you can dream that his faith is fast, Through behoving and unbehoving; Unless you can die when the dream is past— Oh, never call it loving! A MAN'S REQUIREMENTS. I Love me, Sweet, with all thou art, Feeling, thinking, seeing; Love me in the lightest part, Love me in full being. II Love me with thine open youth In its frank surrender; With the vowing of thy mouth, With its silence tender. III Love me with thine azure eyes, Made for earnest granting; Taking colour from the skies, Can Heaven's truth be wanting? IV Love me with their lids, that fall Snow-like at first meeting; Love me with thine heart, that all Neighbours then see beating. V Love me with thine hand stretched out Freely—open-minded: Love me with thy loitering foot,— Hearing one behind it. VI Love me with thy voice, that turns Sudden faint above me; Love me with thy blush that burns When I murmur Love me! VII Love me with thy thinking soul, Break it to love-sighing; Love me with thy thoughts that roll On through living—dying. VIII Love me in thy gorgeous airs, When the world has crowned thee; Love me, kneeling at thy prayers, With the angels round thee. IX Love me pure, as musers do, Up the woodlands shady: Love me gaily, fast and true, As a winsome lady. X Through all hopes that keep us brave, Farther off or nigher, Love me for the house and grave, And for something higher. XI Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear, Woman's love no fable, I will love thee—half a year— As a man is able. A YEAR'S SPINNING. I He listened at the porch that day, To hear the wheel go on, and on; And then it stopped, ran back away, While through the door he brought the sun: But now my spinning is all done. II He sat beside me, with an oath That love ne'er ended, once begun; I smiled—believing for us both, What was the truth for only one: And now my spinning is all done. III My mother cursed me that I heard A young man's wooing as I spun: Thanks, cruel mother, for that word,— For I have, since, a harder known! And now my spinning is all done. IV I thought—O God!—my first-born's cry Both voices to mine ear would drown: I listened in mine agony— It was the silence made me groan! And now my spinning is all done. V Bury me 'twixt my mother's grave, (Who cursed me on her death-bed lone) And my dead baby's (God it save!) Who, not to bless me, would not moan. And now my spinning is all done. VI A stone upon my heart and head, But no name written on the stone! Sweet neighbours, whisper low instead, “This sinner was a loving one— And now her spinning is all done.” VII And let the door ajar remain, In case he should pass by anon; And leave the wheel out very plain,— That he, when passing in the sun, May see the spinning is all done. CHANGE UPON CHANGE. I Five months ago the stream did flow, The lilies bloomed within the sedge, And we were lingering to and fro, Where none will track thee in this snow, Along the stream, beside the hedge. Ah, Sweet, be free to love and go! For if I do not hear thy foot, The frozen river is as mute, The flowers have dried down to the root: And why, since these be changed since May, Shouldst thou change less than they? II And slow, slow as the winter snow The tears have drifted to mine eyes; And my poor cheeks, five months ago Set blushing at thy praises so, Put paleness on for a disguise. Ah, Sweet, be free to praise and go! For if my face is turned too pale, It was thine oath that first did fail,— It was thy love proved false and frail,— And why, since these be changed enow, Should I change less than thou? A REED. I I am no trumpet, but a reed; No flattering breath shall from me lead A silver sound, a hollow sound: I will not ring, for priest or king, One blast that in re-echoing Would leave a bondsman faster bound. II I am no trumpet, but a reed,— A broken reed, the wind indeed Left flat upon a dismal shore; Yet if a little maid or child Should sigh within it, earnest-mild This reed will answer evermore. III I am no trumpet, but a reed; Go, tell the fishers, as they spread Their nets along the river's edge, I will not tear their nets at all, Nor pierce their hands, if they should fall: Then let them leave me in the sedge. A CHILD'S GRAVE AT FLORENCE. A.A.E.C. BORN, JULY 1848. DIED, NOVEMBER 1849. I Of English blood, of Tuscan birth, What country should we give her? Instead of any on the earth, The civic Heavens receive her. II And here among the English tombs In Tuscan ground we lay her, While the blue Tuscan sky endomes Our English words of prayer. III A little child!—how long she lived, By months, not years, is reckoned: Born in one July, she survived Alone to see a second. IV Bright-featured, as the July sun Her little face still played in, And splendours, with her birth begun, Had had no time for fading. V So, Lily, from those July hours, No wonder we should call her; She looked such kinship to the flowers,— Was but a little taller. VI A Tuscan Lily,—only white, As Dante, in abhorrence Of red corruption, wished aright The lilies of his Florence. VII We could not wish her whiter,—her Who perfumed with pure blossom The house—a lovely thing to wear Upon a mother's bosom! VIII This July creature thought perhaps Our speech not worth assuming; She sat upon her parents' laps And mimicked the gnat's humming; IX Said “father,” “mother”—then left off, For tongues celestial, fitter: Her hair had grown just long enough To catch heaven's jasper-glitter. X Babes! Love could always hear and see Behind the cloud that hid them. “Let little children come to Me, And do not thou forbid them.” XI So, unforbidding, have we met, And gently here have laid her, Though winter is no time to get The flowers that should o'erspread her: XII We should bring pansies quick with spring, Rose, violet, daffodilly, And also, above everything, White lilies for our Lily. XIII Nay, more than flowers, this grave exacts,— Glad, grateful attestations Of her sweet eyes and pretty acts, With calm renunciations. XIV Her very mother with light feet Should leave the place too earthy, Saying “The angels have thee, Sweet, Because we are not worthy.” XV But winter kills the orange-buds, The gardens in the frost are, And all the heart dissolves in floods, Remembering we have lost her. XVI Poor earth, poor heart,—too weak, too weak To miss the July shining! Poor heart!—what bitter words we speak When God speaks of resigning! XVII Sustain this heart in us that faints, Thou God, the self-existent! We catch up wild at parting saints And feel Thy heaven too distant. XVIII The wind that swept them out of sin Has ruffled all our vesture: On the shut door that let them in We beat with frantic gesture,— XIX To us, us also, open straight! The outer life is chilly; Are we too, like the earth, to wait Till next year for our Lily? XX —Oh, my own baby on my knees, My leaping, dimpled treasure, At every word I write like these, Clasped close with stronger pressure! XXI Too well my own heart understands,— At every word beats fuller— My little feet, my little hands, And hair of Lily's colour! XXII But God gives patience, Love learns strength, And Faith remembers promise, And Hope itself can smile at length On other hopes gone from us. XXIII Love, strong as Death, shall conquer Death, Through struggle made more glorious: This mother stills her sobbing breath, Renouncing yet victorious. XXIV Arms, empty of her child, she lifts With spirit unbereaven,— “God will not all take back His gifts; My Lily's mine in heaven. XXV “Still mine! maternal rights serene Not given to another! The crystal bars shine faint between The souls of child and mother. XXVI “Meanwhile,” the mother cries, “content! Our love was well divided: Its sweetness following where she went, Its anguish stayed where I did. XXVII “Well done of God, to halve the lot, And give her all the sweetness; To us, the empty room and cot,— To her, the Heaven's completeness. XXVIII “To us, this grave,—to her, the rows The mystic palm-trees spring in; To us, the silence in the house,— To her, the choral singing. XXIX “For her, to gladden in God's view,— For us, to hope and bear on. Grow, Lily, in thy garden new, Beside the Rose of Sharon! XXX “Grow fast in heaven, sweet Lily clipped, In love more calm than this is, And may the angels dewy-lipped Remind thee of our kisses! XXXI “While none shall tell thee of our tears, These human tears now falling, Till, after a few patient years, One home shall take us all in. XXXII “Child, father, mother—who, left out? Not mother, and not father! And when, our dying couch about, The natural mists shall gather, XXXIII “Some smiling angel close shall stand In old Correggio's fashion, And bear a Lily in his hand, For death's annunciation.” LIFE AND LOVE. I Fast this Life of mine was dying, Blind already and calm as death, Snowflakes on her bosom lying Scarcely heaving with her breath. II Love came by, and having known her In a dream of fabled lands, Gently stooped, and laid upon her Mystic chrism of holy hands; III Drew his smile across her folded Eyelids, as the swallow dips; Breathed as finely as the cold did Through the locking of her lips. IV So, when Life looked upward, being Warmed and breathed on from above, What sight could she have for seeing, Evermore . . . but only Love? A DENIAL. I We have met late—it is too late to meet, O friend, not more than friend! Death's forecome shroud is tangled round my feet, And if I step or stir, I touch the end. In this last jeopardy Can I approach thee, I, who cannot move? How shall I answer thy request for love? Look in my face and see. II I love thee not, I dare not love thee! go In silence; drop my hand. If thou seek roses, seek them where they blow In garden-alleys, not in desert-sand. Can life and death agree, That thou shouldst stoop thy song to my complaint? I cannot love thee. If the word is faint, Look in my face and see. III I might have loved thee in some former days. Oh, then, my spirits had leapt As now they sink, at hearing thy love-praise! Before these faded cheeks were overwept, Had this been asked of me, To love thee with my whole strong heart and head,— I should have said still . . . yes, but smiled and said, “Look in my face and see!” IV But now . . . God sees me, God, who took my heart And drowned it in life's surge. In all your wide warm earth I have no part— A light song overcomes me like a dirge. Could Love's great harmony The saints keep step to when their bonds are loose, Not weigh me down? am I a wife to choose? Look in my face and see— V While I behold, as plain as one who dreams, Some woman of full worth, Whose voice, as cadenced as a silver stream's, Shall prove the fountain-soul which sends it forth; One younger, more thought-free And fair and gay, than I, thou must forget, With brighter eyes than these . . . which are not wet . . . Look in my face and see! VI So farewell thou, whom I have known too late To let thee come so near. Be counted happy while men call thee great, And one belovèd woman feels thee dear!— Not I!—that cannot be. I am lost, I am changed,—I must go farther, where The change shall take me worse, and no one dare Look in my face and see. VII Meantime I bless thee. By these thoughts of mine I bless thee from all such! I bless thy lamp to oil, thy cup to wine, Thy hearth to joy, thy hand to an equal touch Of loyal troth. For me, I love thee not, I love thee not!—away! Here's no more courage in my soul to say “Look in my face and see.” PROOF AND DISPROOF. I Dost thou love me, my Belovèd? Who shall answer yes or no? What is provèd or disprovèd When my soul inquireth so, Dost thou love me, my Belovèd? II I have seen thy heart to-day, Never open to the crowd, While to love me aye and aye Was the vow as it was vowed By thine eyes of steadfast grey. III Now I sit alone, alone— And the hot tears break and burn, Now, Belovèd, thou art gone, Doubt and terror have their turn. Is it love that I have known? IV I have known some bitter things,— Anguish, anger, solitude. Year by year an evil brings, Year by year denies a good; March winds violate my springs. V I have known how sickness bends, I have known how sorrow breaks,— How quick hopes have sudden ends, How the heart thinks till it aches Of the smile of buried friends. VI Last, I have known thee, my brave Noble thinker, lover, doer! The best knowledge last I have. But thou comest as the thrower Of fresh flowers upon a grave. VII Count what feelings used to move me! Can this love assort with those? Thou, who art so far above me, Wilt thou stoop so, for repose? Is it true that thou canst love me? VIII Do not blame me if I doubt thee. I can call love by its name When thine arm is wrapt about me; But even love seems not the same, When I sit alone, without thee. IX In thy clear eyes I descried Many a proof of love, to-day; But to-night, those unbelied Speechful eyes being gone away, There's the proof to seek, beside. X Dost thou love me, my Belovèd? Only thou canst answer yes! And, thou gone, the proof's disprovèd, And the cry rings answerless— Dost thou love me, my Belovèd? QUESTION AND ANSWER. I Love you seek for, presupposes Summer heat and sunny glow. Tell me, do you find moss-roses Budding, blooming in the snow? Snow might kill the rose-tree's root— Shake it quickly from your foot, Lest it harm you as you go. II From the ivy where it dapples A grey ruin, stone by stone, Do you look for grapes or apples, Or for sad green leaves alone? Pluck the leaves off, two or three— Keep them for morality When you shall be safe and gone. INCLUSIONS. I Oh, wilt thou have my hand, Dear, to lie along in thine? As a little stone in a running stream, it seems to lie and pine. Now drop the poor pale hand, Dear, unfit to plight with thine. II Oh, wilt thou have my cheek, Dear, drawn closer to thine own? My cheek is white, my cheek is worn, by many a tear run down. Now leave a little space, Dear, lest it should wet thine own. III Oh, must thou have my soul, Dear, commingled with thy soul?— Red grows the cheek, and warm the hand; the part is in the whole: Nor hands nor cheeks keep separate, when soul is joined to soul. INSUFFICIENCY. I There is no one beside thee and no one above thee, Thou standest alone as the nightingale sings! And my words that would praise thee are impotent things, For none can express thee though all should approve thee. I love thee so, Dear, that I only can love thee. II Say, what can I do for thee? weary thee, grieve thee? Lean on thy shoulder, new burdens to add? Weep my tears over thee, making thee sad? Oh, hold me not—love me not! let me retrieve thee. I love thee so, Dear, that I only can leave thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE. 1847–1850. I. [I thought once how Theocritus had sung] I thought once how Theocritus had sung Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years, Who each one in a gracious hand appears To bear a gift for mortals, old or young: And, as I mused it in his antique tongue, I saw, in gradual vision through my tears, The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years, Those of my own life, who by turns had flung A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware, So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair; And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,— “Guess now who holds thee?”—“Death,” I said. But, there, The silver answer rang,—“Not Death, but Love.” II. [But only three in all God's universe] But only three in all God's universe Have heard this word thou hast said,—Himself, beside Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied One of us . . . that was God, . . . and laid the curse So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce My sight from seeing thee,—that if I had died, The deathweights, placed there, would have signified Less absolute exclusion. “Nay” is worse From God than from all others, O my friend! Men could not part us with their worldly jars, Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend; Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars: And, heaven being rolled between us at the end, We should but vow the faster for the stars. III. [Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart!] Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart! Unlike our uses and our destinies. Our ministering two angels look surprise On one another, as they strike athwart Their wings in passing. Thou, bethink thee, art A guest for queens to social pageantries, With gages from a hundred brighter eyes Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part Of chief musician. What hast thou to do With looking from the lattice-lights at me, A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree? The chrism is on thine head,—on mine, the dew,— And Death must dig the level where these agree. IV. [Thou hast thy calling to some palace-floor] Thou hast thy calling to some palace-floor, Most gracious singer of high poems! where The dancers will break footing, from the care Of watching up thy pregnant lips for more. And dost thou lift this house's latch too poor For hand of thine? and canst thou think and bear To let thy music drop here unaware In folds of golden fulness at my door? Look up and see the casement broken in, The bats and owlets builders in the roof! My cricket chirps against thy mandolin. Hush, call no echo up in further proof Of desolation! there's a voice within That weeps . . . as thou must sing . . . alone, aloof. V. [I lift my heavy heart up solemnly] I lift my heavy heart up solemnly, As once Electra her sepulchral urn, And, looking in thine eyes, I overturn The ashes at thy feet. Behold and see What a great heap of grief lay hid in me, And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn Through the ashen greyness. If thy foot in scorn Could tread them out to darkness utterly, It might be well perhaps. But if instead Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow The grey dust up, . . . those laurels on thine head, O my Belovèd, will not shield thee so, That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred The hair beneath. Stand farther off then! go. VI. [Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand] Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore Alone upon the threshold of my door Of individual life, I shall command The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand Serenely in the sunshine as before, Without the sense of that which I forbore— Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine With pulses that beat double. What I do And what I dream include thee, as the wine Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue God for myself, He hears that name of thine, And sees within my eyes the tears of two. VII. [The face of all the world is changed, I think] The face of all the world is changed, I think, Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink, Was caught up into love, and taught the whole Of life in a new rhythm. The cup of dole God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink, And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear. The names of country, heaven, are changed away For where thou art or shalt be, there or here; And this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday, (The singing angels know) are only dear Because thy name moves right in what they say. VIII. [What can I give thee back, O liberal] What can I give thee back, O liberal And princely giver, who hast brought the gold And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold, And laid them on the outside of the wall For such as I to take or leave withal, In unexpected largesse? am I cold, Ungrateful, that for these most manifold High gifts, I render nothing back at all? Not so; not cold,—but very poor instead. Ask God who knows. For frequent tears have run The colours from my life, and left so dead And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done To give the same as pillow to thy head. Go farther! let it serve to trample on. IX. [Can it be right to give what I can give?] Can it be right to give what I can give? To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years Re-sighing on my lips renunciative Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live For all thy adjurations? O my fears, That this can scarce be right! We are not peers, So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve, That givers of such gifts as mine are, must Be counted with the ungenerous. Out, alas! I will not soil thy purple with my dust, Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass, Nor give thee any love—which were unjust. Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass. X. [Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed] Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright, Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed: And love is fire. And when I say at need I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee—in thy sight I stand transfigured, glorified aright, With conscience of the new rays that proceed Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures Who love God, God accepts while loving so. And what I feel, across the inferior features Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show How that great work of Love enhances Nature's. XI. [And therefore if to love can be desert] And therefore if to love can be desert, I am not all unworthy. Cheeks as pale As these you see, and trembling knees that fail To bear the burden of a heavy heart,— This weary minstrel-life that once was girt To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale A melancholy music,—why advert To these things? O Belovèd, it is plain I am not of thy worth nor for thy place! And yet, because I love thee, I obtain From that same love this vindicating grace, To live on still in love, and yet in vain,— To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face. XII. [Indeed this very love which is my boast] Indeed this very love which is my boast, And which, when rising up from breast to brow, Doth crown me with a ruby large enow To draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost,— This love even, all my worth, to the utter-most, I should not love withal, unless that thou Hadst set me an example, shown me how, When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed, And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak Of love even, as a good thing of my own: Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak, And placed it by thee on a golden throne,— And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!) Is by thee only, whom I love alone. XIII. [And wilt thou have me fashion into speech] And wilt thou have me fashion into speech The love I bear thee, finding words enough, And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough, Between our faces, to cast light on each?— I drop it at thy feet. I cannot teach My hand to hold my spirit so far off From myself—me—that I should bring thee proof In words, of love hid in me out of reach. Nay, let the silence of my womanhood Commend my woman-love to thy belief,— Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed, And rend the garment of my life, in brief, By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude, Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief. XIV. [If thou must love me, let it be for nought] If thou must love me, let it be for nought Except for love's sake only. Do not say “I love her for her smile—her look—her way Of speaking gently,—for a trick of thought That falls in well with mine, and certes brought A sense of pleasant ease on such a day”— For these things in themselves, Belovèd, may Be changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought, May be unwrought so. Neither love me for Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,— A creature might forget to weep, who bore Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby! But love me for love's sake, that evermore Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity. XV. [Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear] Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear Too calm and sad a face in front of thine; For we two look two ways, and cannot shine With the same sunlight on our brow and hair. On me thou lookest with no doubting care, As on a bee shut in a crystalline; Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love's divine, And to spread wing and fly in the outer air Were most impossible failure, if I strove To fail so. But I look on thee—on thee— Beholding, besides love, the end of love, Hearing oblivion beyond memory; As one who sits and gazes from above, Over the rivers to the bitter sea. XVI. [And yet, because thou overcomest so] And yet, because thou overcomest so, Because thou art more noble and like a king, Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow Too close against thine heart henceforth to know How it shook when alone. Why, conquering May prove as lordly and complete a thing In lifting upward, as in crushing low! And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword To one who lifts him from the bloody earth, Even so, Belovèd, I at last record, Here ends my strife. If thou invite me forth, I rise above abasement at the word. Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth. XVII. [My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes] My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes God set between His After and Before, And strike up and strike off the general roar Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats In a serene air purely. Antidotes Of medicated music, answering for Mankind's forlornest uses, thou canst pour From thence into their ears. God's will devotes Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine. How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use? A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse? A shade, in which to sing—of palm or pine? A grave, on which to rest from singing? Choose. XVIII. [I never gave a lock of hair away] I never gave a lock of hair away To a man, Dearest, except this to thee, Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully, I ring out to the full brown length and say “Take it.” My day of youth went yesterday; My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee, Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree, As girls do, any more: it only may Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears, Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside Through sorrow's trick. I thought the funeral-shears Would take this first, but Love is justified,— Take it thou,—finding pure, from all those years, The kiss my mother left here when she died. XIX. [The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise] The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise; I barter curl for curl upon that mart, And from my poet's forehead to my heart Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,— As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart, . . . The bay-crown's shade, Belovèd, I surmise, Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black! Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath, I tie the shadows safe from gliding back, And lay the gift where nothing hindereth; Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack No natural heat till mine grows cold in death. XX. [Beloved, my Belovèd, when I think] Beloved, my Belovèd, when I think That thou wast in the world a year ago, What time I sat alone here in the snow And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink No moment at thy voice, but, link by link, Went counting all my chains as if that so They never could fall off at any blow Struck by thy possible hand,—why, thus I drink Of life's great cup of wonder! Wonderful, Never to feel thee thrill the day or night With personal act or speech,—nor ever cull Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull, Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight. XXI. [Say over again, and yet once over again] Say over again, and yet once over again, That thou dost love me. Though the word repeated Should seem “a cuckoo-song,” as thou dost treat it, Remember, never to the hill or plain, Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed. Belovèd, I, amid the darkness greeted By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt's pain Cry, “Speak once more—thou lovest!” Who can fear Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll, Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year? Say thou dost love me, love me, love me—toll The silver iterance!—only minding, Dear, To love me also in silence with thy soul. XXII. [When our two souls stand up erect and strong] When our two souls stand up erect and strong, Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher, Until the lengthening wings break into fire At either curvèd point,—what bitter wrong Can the earth do to us, that we should not long Be here contented? Think. In mounting higher, The angels would press on us and aspire To drop some golden orb of perfect song Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay Rather on earth, Belovèd,—where the unfit Contrarious moods of men recoil away And isolate pure spirits, and permit A place to stand and love in for a day, With darkness and the death-hour rounding it. XXIII. [Is it indeed so? If I lay here dead] Is it indeed so? If I lay here dead, Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine? And would the sun for thee more coldly shine Because of grave-damps falling round my head? I marvelled, my Belovèd, when I read Thy thought so in the letter. I am thine— But . . . so much to thee? Can I pour thy wine While my hands tremble? Then my soul, instead Of dreams of death, resumes life's lower range. Then, love me, Love! look on me—breathe on me! As brighter ladies do not count it strange, For love, to give up acres and degree, I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange My near sweet view of Heaven, for earth with thee! XXIV. [Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife] Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife, Shut in upon itself and do no harm In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm, And let us hear no sound of human strife After the click of the shutting. Life to life— I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm, And feel as safe as guarded by a charm Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife Are weak to injure. Very whitely still The lilies of our lives may reassure Their blossoms from their roots, accessible Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer, Growing straight, out of man's reach, on the hill. God only, who made us rich, can make us poor. XXV. [A heavy heart, Belovèd, have I borne] A heavy heart, Belovèd, have I borne From year to year until I saw thy face, And sorrow after sorrow took the place Of all those natural joys as lightly worn As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn By a beating heart at dance-time. Hopes apace Were changed to long despairs, till God's own grace Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn My heavy heart. Then thou didst bid me bring And let it drop adown thy calmly great Deep being! Fast it sinketh, as a thing Which its own nature doth precipitate, While thine doth close above it, mediating Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate. XXVI. [I lived with visions for my company] I lived with visions for my company Instead of men and women, years ago, And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know A sweeter music than they played to me. But soon their trailing purple was not free Of this world's dust, their lutes did silent grow, And I myself grew faint and blind below Their vanishing eyes. Then thou didst come—to be, Belovèd, what they seemed. Their shining fronts, Their songs, their splendours (better, yet the same, As river-water hallowed into fonts), Met in thee, and from out thee overcame My soul with satisfaction of all wants: Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame. XXVII. [My own Belovèd, who hast lifted me] My own Belovèd, who hast lifted me From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown, And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully Shines out again, as all the angels see, Before thy saving kiss! My own, my own, Who camest to me when the world was gone, And I who looked for only God, found thee! I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad. As one who stands in dewless asphodel Looks backward on the tedious time he had In the upper life,—so I, with bosom-swell, Make witness, here, between the good and bad, That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well. XXVIII. [My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!] My letters! all dead paper, mute and white! And yet they seem alive and quivering Against my tremulous hands which loose the string And let them drop down on my knee to-night. This said,—he wished to have me in his sight Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring To come and touch my hand . . . a simple thing, Yet I wept for it!—this, . . . the paper's light . . . Said, Dear, I love thee; and I sank and quailed As if God's future thundered on my past. This said, I am thine—and so its ink has paled With lying at my heart that beat too fast. And this . . . O Love, thy words have ill availed If, what this said, I dared repeat at last! XXIX. [I think of thee!—my thoughts do twine and bud] I think of thee!—my thoughts do twine and bud About thee, as wild vines, about a tree, Put out broad leaves, and soon there's nought to see Except the straggling green which hides the wood. Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood I will not have my thoughts instead of thee Who art dearer, better! Rather, instantly Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should, Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare, And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee Drop heavily down,—burst, shattered, everywhere! Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee And breathe within thy shadow a new air, I do not think of thee—I am too near thee. XXX. [I see thine image through my tears to-night] I see thine image through my tears to-night, And yet to-day I saw thee smiling. How Refer the cause?—Belovèd, is it thou Or I, who makes me sad? The acolyte Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow, On the altar-stair. I hear thy voice and vow, Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight, As he, in his swooning ears, the choir's Amen. Belovèd, dost thou love? or did I see all The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when Too vehement light dilated my ideal, For my soul's eyes? Will that light come again, As now these tears come—falling hot and real? XXXI. [Thou comest! all is said without a word.] Thou comest! all is said without a word. I sit beneath thy looks, as children do In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through Their happy eyelids from an unaverred Yet prodigal inward joy. Behold, I erred In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue The sin most, but the occasion—that we two Should for a moment stand unministered By a mutual presence. Ah, keep near and close, Thou dovelike help! and, when my fears would rise, With thy broad heart serenely interpose: Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those, Like callow birds left desert to the skies. XXXII. [The first time that the sun rose on thine oath] The first time that the sun rose on thine oath To love me, I looked forward to the moon To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon And quickly tied to make a lasting troth. Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe; And, looking on myself, I seemed not one For such man's love!—more like an out-of-tune Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste, Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note. I did not wrong myself so, but I placed A wrong on thee. For perfect strains may float 'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,— And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat. XXXIII. [Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear] Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear The name I used to run at, when a child, From innocent play, and leave the cowslips piled, To glance up in some face that proved me dear With the look of its eyes. I miss the clear Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled Into the music of Heaven's undefiled, Call me no longer. Silence on the bier, While I call God—call God!—So let thy mouth Be heir to those who are now exanimate. Gather the north flowers to complete the south, And catch the early love up in the late. Yes, call me by that name,—and I, in truth, With the same heart, will answer and not wait. XXXIV. [With the same heart, I said, I'll answer thee] With the same heart, I said, I'll answer thee As those, when thou shalt call me by my name— Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same, Perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy? When called before, I told how hastily I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game, To run and answer with the smile that came At play last moment, and went on with me Through my obedience. When I answer now, I drop a grave thought, break from solitude; Yet still my heart goes to thee—ponder how— Not as to a single good, but all my good! Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow That no child's foot could run fast as this blood. XXXV. [If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange] If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange And be all to me? Shall I never miss Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange, When I look up, to drop on a new range Of walls and floors, another home than this? Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change? That's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried, To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove; For grief indeed is love and grief beside. Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love. Yet love me—wilt thou? Open thine heart wide, And fold within the wet wings of thy dove. XXXVI. [When we met first and loved, I did not build] When we met first and loved, I did not build Upon the event with marble. Could it mean To last, a love set pendulous between Sorrow and sorrow? Nay, I rather thrilled, Distrusting every light that seemed to gild The onward path, and feared to overlean A finger even. And, though I have grown serene And strong since then, I think that God has willed A still renewable fear . . . O love, O troth . . . Lest these enclaspèd hands should never hold, This mutual kiss drop down between us both As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold. And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath, Must lose one joy, by his life's star foretold. XXXVII. [Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make] Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make, Of all that strong divineness which I know For thine and thee, an image only so Formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break. It is that distant years which did not take Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow, Have forced my swimming brain to undergo Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake Thy purity of likeness and distort Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit: As if a shipwrecked Pagan, safe in port, His guardian sea-god to commemorate, Should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort And vibrant tail, within the temple-gate. XXXVIII. [First time he kissed me, he but only kissed] First time he kissed me, he but only kissed The fingers of this hand wherewith I write; And ever since, it grew more clean and white, Slow to world-greetings, quick with its “Oh, list,” When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst I could not wear here, plainer to my sight, Than that first kiss. The second passed in height The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed, Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed! That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown, With sanctifying sweetness, did precede. The third upon my lips was folded down In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed, I have been proud and said, “My love, my own.” XXXIX. [Because thou hast the power and own'st the grace] Because thou hast the power and own'st the grace To look through and behind this mask of me (Against which years have beat thus blanchingly With their rains), and behold my soul's true face, The dim and weary witness of life's race,— Because thou hast the faith and love to see, Through that same soul's distracting lethargy, The patient angel waiting for a place In the new Heavens,—because nor sin nor woe, Nor God's infliction, nor death's neighbourhood, Nor all which others viewing, turn to go, Nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,— Nothing repels thee, . . . Dearest, teach me so To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good! XL. [Oh, yes! they love through all this world of ours!] Oh, yes! they love through all this world of ours! I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth. I have heard love talked in my early youth, And since, not so long back but that the flowers Then gathered, smell still. Mussulmans and Giaours Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth For any weeping. Polypheme's white tooth Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers, The shell is over-smooth,—and not so much Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate Or else to oblivion. But thou art not such A lover, my Belovèd! thou canst wait Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch, And think it soon when others cry “Too late.” XLI. [I thank all who have loved me in their hearts] I thank all who have loved me in their hearts, With thanks and love from mine. Deep thanks to all Who paused a little near the prison-wall To hear my music in its louder parts Ere they went onward, each one to the mart's Or temple's occupation, beyond call. But thou, who, in my voice's sink and fall When the sob took it, thy divinest Art's Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot To hearken what I said between my tears, . . . Instruct me how to thank thee! Oh, to shoot My soul's full meaning into future years, That they should lend it utterance, and salute Love that endures, from Life that disappears! XLII. [“My future will not copy fair my past”—] “My future will not copy fair my past”— I wrote that once; and thinking at my side My ministering life-angel justified The word by his appealing look upcast To the white throne of God, I turned at last, And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied To angels in thy soul! Then I, long tried By natural ills, received the comfort fast, While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim's staff Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled. I seek no copy now of life's first half: Leave here the pages with long musing curled, And write me new my future's epigraph, New angel mine, unhoped for in the world! XLIII. [How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.] How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of everyday's Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. XLIV. [Belovèd, thou hast brought me many flowers] Belovèd, thou hast brought me many flowers Plucked in the garden, all the summer through And winter, and it seemed as if they grew In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers. So, in the like name of that love of ours, Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too, And which on warm and cold days I withdrew From my heart's ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue, And wait thy weeding; yet here's eglantine, Here's ivy!—take them, as I used to do Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine. Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true, And tell thy soul their roots are left in mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CASA GUIDI WINDOWS. A POEM, IN TWO PARTS. 1851. PART I. I heard last night a little child go singing 'Neath Casa Guidi windows, by the church, O bella libertà, O bella!—stringing The same words still on notes he went in search So high for, you concluded the upspringing Of such a nimble bird to sky from perch Must leave the whole bush in a tremble green, And that the heart of Italy must beat, While such a voice had leave to rise serene 'Twixt church and palace of a Florence street: A little child, too, who not long had been By mother's finger steadied on his feet, And still O bella libertà he sang. Then I thought, musing, of the innumerous Sweet songs which still for Italy outrang From older singers' lips who sang not thus Exultingly and purely, yet, with pang Fast sheathed in music, touched the heart of us So finely that the pity scarcely pained. I thought how Filicaja led on others, Bewailers for their Italy enchained, And how they called her childless among mothers, Widow of empires, ay, and scarce refrained Cursing her beauty to her face, as brothers Might a shamed sister's,—“Had she been less fair She were less wretched;”—how, evoking so From congregated wrong and heaped despair Of men and women writhing under blow, Harrowed and hideous in a filthy lair, Some personating Image wherein woe Was wrapt in beauty from offending much, They called it Cybele, or Niobe, Or laid it corpse-like on a bier for such, Where all the world might drop for Italy Those cadenced tears which burn not where they touch,— “Juliet of nations, canst thou die as we? And was the violet crown that crowned thy head So over-large, though new buds made it rough, It slipped down and across thine eyelids dead, O sweet, fair Juliet?” Of such songs enough, Too many of such complaints! behold, instead, Void at Verona, Juliet's marble trough: They show at Verona, as the tomb of Juliet, an empty trough of stone. As void as that is, are all images Men set between themselves and actual wrong, To catch the weight of pity, meet the stress Of conscience,—since 'tis easier to gaze long On mournful masks and sad effigies Than on real, live, weak creatures crushed by strong. For me who stand in Italy to-day Where worthier poets stood and sang before, I kiss their footsteps yet their words gainsay. I can but muse in hope upon this shore Of golden Arno as it shoots away Through Florence' heart beneath her bridges four: Bent bridges, seeming to strain off like bows, And tremble while the arrowy undertide Shoots on and cleaves the marble as it goes, And strikes up palace-walls on either side, And froths the cornice out in glittering rows, With doors and windows quaintly multiplied, And terrace-sweeps, and gazers upon all, By whom if flower or kerchief were thrown out From any lattice there, the same would fall Into the river underneath, no doubt, It runs so close and fast 'twixt wall and wall. How beautiful! the mountains from without In silence listen for the word said next. What word will men say,—here where Giotto planted His campanile like an unperplexed Fine question Heavenward, touching the things granted A noble people who, being greatly vexed In act, in aspiration keep undaunted? What word will God say? Michel's Night and Day And Dawn and Twilight wait in marble scorn These famous statues recline in the Sagrestia Nuova, on the tombs of Giuliano de' Medici, third son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and Lorenzo of Urbino, his grandson. Strozzi's epigram on the Night, with Michel Angelo's rejoinder, is well known. Like dogs upon a dunghill, couched on clay From whence the Medicean stamp's outworn, The final putting off of all such sway By all such hands, and freeing of the unborn In Florence and the great world outside Florence. Three hundred years his patient statues wait In that small chapel of the dim Saint Lawrence: Day's eyes are breaking bold and passionate Over his shoulder, and will flash abhorrence On darkness and with level looks meet fate, When once loose from that marble film of theirs; The Night has wild dreams in her sleep, the Dawn Is haggard as the sleepless, Twilight wears A sort of horror; as the veil withdrawn 'Twixt the artist's soul and works had left them heirs Of speechless thoughts which would not quail nor fawn, Of angers and contempts, of hope and love: For not without a meaning did he place The princely Urbino on the seat above With everlasting shadow on his face, While the slow dawns and twilights disapprove The ashes of his long-extinguished race Which never more shall clog the feet of men. I do believe, divinest Angelo, That winter-hour in Via Larga, when They bade thee build a statue up in snow This mocking task was set by Pietro, the unworthy successor of Lorenzo the Magnificent. And straight that marvel of thine art again Dissolved beneath the sun's Italian glow, Thine eyes, dilated with the plastic passion, Thawing too in drops of wounded manhood, since, To mock alike thine art and indignation, Laughed at the palace-window the new prince,— (“Aha! this genius needs for exaltation, When all's said and howe'er the proud may wince, A little marble from our princely mines!”) I do believe that hour thou laughedst too For the whole sad world and for thy Florentines, After those few tears, which were only few! That as, beneath the sun, the grand white lines Of thy snow-statue trembled and withdrew,— The head, erect as Jove's, being palsied first, The eyelids flattened, the full brow turned blank, The right-hand, raised but now as if it cursed, Dropt, a mere snowball, (till the people sank Their voices, though a louder laughter burst From the royal window)—thou couldst proudly thank God and the prince for promise and presage, And laugh the laugh back, I think verily, Thine eyes being purged by tears of righteous rage To read a wrong into a prophecy, And measure a true great man's heritage Against a mere great-duke's posterity. I think thy soul said then, “I do not need A princedom and its quarries, after all; For if I write, paint, carve a word, indeed, On book or board or dust, on floor or wall, The same is kept of God who taketh heed That not a letter of the meaning fall Or ere it touch and teach His world's deep heart, Outlasting, therefore, all your lordships, sir! So keep your stone, beseech you, for your part, To cover up your grave-place and refer The proper titles; I live by my art. The thought I threw into this snow shall stir This gazing people when their gaze is done; And the tradition of your act and mine, When all the snow is melted in the sun, Shall gather up, for unborn men, a sign Of what is the true princedom,—ay, and none Shall laugh that day, except the drunk with wine.” Amen, great Angelo! the day's at hand. If many laugh not on it, shall we weep? Much more we must not, let us understand. Through rhymers sonneteering in their sleep, And archaists mumbling dry bones up the land, And sketchers lauding ruined towns a-heap,— Through all that drowsy hum of voices smooth, The hopeful bird mounts carolling from brake, The hopeful child, with leaps to catch his growth, Sings open-eyed for liberty's sweet sake: And I, a singer also from my youth, Prefer to sing with these who are awake, With birds, with babes, with men who will not fear The baptism of the holy morning dew, (And many of such wakers now are here, Complete in their anointed manhood, who Will greatly dare and greatlier persevere,) Than join those old thin voices with my new, And sigh for Italy with some safe sigh Cooped up in music 'twixt an oh and ah,— Nay, hand in hand with that young child, will I Go singing rather, “Bella libertà,” Than, with those poets, croon the dead or cry “Se tu men bella fossi, Italia!” “Less wretched if less fair.” Perhaps a truth Is so far plain in this, that Italy, Long trammelled with the purple of her youth Against her age's ripe activity, Sits still upon her tombs, without death's ruth But also without life's brave energy. “Now tell us what is Italy?” men ask: And others answer, “Virgil, Cicero, Catullus, Cæsar.” What beside? to task The memory closer—“Why, Boccaccio, Dante, Petrarca,”—and if still the flask Appears to yield its wine by drops too slow,— “Angelo, Raffael, Pergolese,”—all Whose strong hearts beat through stone, or charged again The paints with fire of souls electrical, Or broke up heaven for music. What more then? Why, then, no more. The chaplet's last beads fall In naming the last saintship within ken, And, after that, none prayeth in the land. Alas, this Italy has too long swept Heroic ashes up for hour-glass sand; Of her own past, impassioned nympholept! Consenting to be nailed here by the hand To the very bay-tree under which she stept A queen of old, and plucked a leafy branch; And, licensing the world too long indeed To use her broad phylacteries to staunch And stop her bloody lips, she takes no heed How one clear word would draw an avalanche Of living sons around her, to succeed The vanished generations. Can she count These oil-eaters with large live mobile mouths Agape for macaroni, in the amount Of consecrated heroes of her south's Bright rosary? The pitcher at the fount, The gift of gods, being broken, she much loathes To let the ground-leaves of the place confer A natural bowl. So henceforth she would seem No nation, but the poet's pensioner, With alms from every land of song and dream, While aye her pipers sadly pipe of her Until their proper breaths, in that extreme Of sighing, split the reed on which they played: Of which, no more. But never say “no more” To Italy's life! Her memories undismayed Still argue “evermore;” her graves implore Her future to be strong and not afraid; Her very statues send their looks before. We do not serve the dead—the past is past. God lives, and lifts His glorious mornings up Before the eyes of men awake at last, Who put away the meats they used to sup, And down upon the dust of earth outcast The dregs remaining of the ancient cup, Then turn to wakeful prayer and worthy act. The Dead, upon their awful 'vantage ground, The sun not in their faces, shall abstract No more our strength; we will not be discrowned As guardians of their crowns, nor deign transact A barter of the present, for a sound Of good so counted in the foregone days. O Dead, ye shall no longer cling to us With rigid hands of desiccating praise, And drag us backward by the garment thus, To stand and laud you in long-drawn virelays! We will not henceforth be oblivious Of our own lives, because ye lived before, Nor of our acts, because ye acted well. We thank you that ye first unlatched the door, But will not make it inaccessible By thankings on the threshold any more. We hurry onward to extinguish hell With our fresh souls, our younger hope, and God's Maturity of purpose. Soon shall we Die also! and, that then our periods Of life may round themselves to memory As smoothly as on our graves the burial-sods, We now must look to it to excel as ye, And bear our age as far, unlimited By the last mind-mark; so, to be invoked By future generations, as their Dead. 'Tis true that when the dust of death has choked A great man's voice, the common words he said Turn oracles, the common thoughts he yoked Like horses, draw like griffins: this is true And acceptable. I, too, should desire, When men make record, with the flowers they strew, “Savonarola's soul went out in fire Upon our Grand-duke's piazza, Savonarola was burnt for his testimony against papal corruptions as early as March, 1498: and, as late as our own day, it has been a custom in Florence to strew with violets the pavement where he suffered, in grateful recognition of the anniversary. and burned through A moment first, or ere he did expire, The veil betwixt the right and wrong, and showed How near God sat and judged the judges there,—” Upon the self-same pavement overstrewed To cast my violets with as reverent care, And prove that all the winters which have snowed Cannot snow out the scent from stones and air, Of a sincere man's virtues. This was he, Savonarola, who, while Peter sank With his whole boat-load, called courageously “Wake Christ, wake Christ!”—who, having tried the tank Of old church-waters used for baptistry Ere Luther came to spill them, swore they stank; Who also by a princely deathbed cried, “Loose Florence, or God will not loose thy soul!” Then fell back the Magnificent and died Beneath the star-look shooting from the cowl, Which turned to wormwood-bitterness the wide Deep sea of his ambitions. It were foul To grudge Savonarola and the rest Their violets: rather pay them quick and fresh! The emphasis of death makes manifest The eloquence of action in our flesh; And men who, living, were but dimly guessed, When once free from their life's entangled mesh, Show their full length in graves, or oft indeed Exaggerate their stature, in the flat, To noble admirations which exceed Most nobly, yet will calculate in that But accurately. We, who are the seed Of buried creatures, if we turned and spat Upon our antecedents, we were vile. Bring violets rather. If these had not walked Their furlong, could we hope to walk our mile? Therefore bring violets. Yet if we self-baulked Stand still, a-strewing violets all the while, These moved in vain, of whom we have vainly talked. So rise up henceforth with a cheerful smile, And having strewn the violets, reap the corn, And having reaped and garnered, bring the plough And draw new furrows 'neath the healthy morn, And plant the great Hereafter in this Now. Of old 'twas so. How step by step was worn, As each man gained on each securely!—how Each by his own strength sought his own Ideal,— The ultimate Perfection leaning bright From out the sun and stars to bless the leal And earnest search of all for Fair and Right Through doubtful forms by earth accounted real! Because old Jubal blew into delight The souls of men with clear-piped melodies, If youthful Asaph were content at most To draw from Jubal's grave, with listening eyes, Traditionary music's floating ghost Into the grass-grown silence, were it wise? And was't not wiser, Jubal's breath being lost, That Miriam clashed her cymbals to surprise The sun between her white arms flung apart, With new glad golden sounds? that David's strings O'erflowed his hand with music from his heart? So harmony grows full from many springs, And happy accident turns holy art. You enter, in your Florence wanderings, The church of Saint Maria Novella. Pass The left stair, where at plague-time Machiavel See his description of the plague in Florence. Saw One with set fair face as in a glass, Dressed out against the fear of death and hell, Rustling her silks in pauses of the mass, To keep the thought off how her husband fell, When she left home, stark dead across her feet,— The stair leads up to what the Orgagnas save Of Dante's dæmons; you, in passing it, Ascend the right stair from the farther nave To muse in a small chapel scarcely lit By Cimabue's Virgin. Bright and brave, That picture was accounted, mark, of old: A king stood bare before its sovran grace, Charles of Anjou, in his passage through Florence, was permitted to see this picture while yet in Cimabue's “bottega.” The populace followed the royal visitor, and, from the universal delight and admiration, the quarter of the city in which the artist lived was called “Borgo Allegri.” The picture was carried in triumph to the church, and deposited there. A reverent people shouted to behold The picture, not the king, and even the place Containing such a miracle grew bold, Named the Glad Borgo from that beauteous face Which thrilled the artist, after work, to think His own ideal Mary-smile should stand So very near him,—he, within the brink Of all that glory, let in by his hand With too divine a rashness! Yet none shrink Who come to gaze here now; albeit 'twas planned Sublimely in the thought's simplicity: The Lady, throned in empyreal state, Minds only the young Babe upon her knee, While sidelong angels bear the royal weight, Prostrated meekly, smiling tenderly Oblivion of their wings; the Child thereat Stretching its hand like God. If any should, Because of some stiff draperies and loose joints, Gaze scorn down from the heights of Raffaelhood On Cimabue's picture,—Heaven anoints The head of no such critic, and his blood The poet's curse strikes full on and appoints To ague and cold spasms for evermore. A noble picture! worthy of the shout Wherewith along the streets the people bore Its cherub-faces which the sun threw out Until they stooped and entered the church door. Yet rightly was young Giotto talked about, Whom Cimabue found among the sheep, How Cimabue found Giotto, the shepherd-boy, sketching a ram of his flock upon a stone, is prettily told by Vasari,—who also relates that the elder artist Margheritone died “infastidito” of the successes of the new school. And knew, as gods know gods, and carried home To paint the things he had painted, with a deep And fuller insight, and so overcome His chapel-Lady with a heavenlier sweep Of light: for thus we mount into the sum Of great things known or acted. I hold, too, That Cimabue smiled upon the lad At the first stroke which passed what he could do, Or else his Virgin's smile had never had Such sweetness in't. All great men who foreknew Their heirs in art, for art's sake have been glad, And bent their old white heads as if uncrowned, Fanatics of their pure Ideals still Far more than of their triumphs, which were found With some less vehement struggle of the will. If old Margheritone trembled, swooned And died despairing at the open sill Of other men's achievements (who achieved, By loving art beyond the master), he Was old Margheritone, and conceived Never, at first youth and most ecstasy, A Virgin like that dream of one, which heaved The death-sigh from his heart. If wistfully Margheritone sickened at the smell Of Cimabue's laurel, let him go! For Cimabue stood up very well In spite of Giotto's, and Angelico The artist-saint kept smiling in his cell The smile with which he welcomed the sweet slow Inbreak of angels (whitening through the dim That he might paint them), while the sudden sense Of Raffael's future was revealed to him By force of his own fair works' competence. The same blue waters where the dolphins swim Suggest the tritons. Through the blue Immense Strike out, all swimmers! cling not in the way Of one another, so to sink; but learn The strong man's impulse, catch the freshening spray He throws up in his motions, and discern By his clear westering eye, the time of day. Thou, God, hast set us worthy gifts to earn Besides Thy heaven and Thee! and when I say There's room here for the weakest man alive To live and die, there's room too, I repeat, For all the strongest to live well, and strive Their own way, by their individual heat,— Like some new bee-swarm leaving the old hive, Despite the wax which tempts so violet-sweet. Then let the living live, the dead retain Their grave-cold flowers!—though honour's best supplied By bringing actions, to prove theirs not vain. Cold graves, we say? it shall be testified That living men who burn in heart and brain, Without the dead were colder. If we tried To sink the past beneath our feet, be sure The future would not stand. Precipitate This old roof from the shrine, and, insecure, The nesting swallows fly off, mate from mate. How scant the gardens, if the graves were fewer! The tall green poplars grew no longer straight Whose tops not looked to Troy. Would any fight For Athens, and not swear by Marathon? Who dared build temples, without tombs in sight? Or live, without some dead man's benison? Or seek truth, hope for good, and strive for right, If, looking up, he saw not in the sun Some angel of the martyrs all day long Standing and waiting? Your last rhythm will need Your earliest key-note. Could I sing this song, If my dead masters had not taken heed To help the heavens and earth to make me strong, As the wind ever will find out some reed And touch it to such issues as belong To such a frail thing? None may grudge the Dead Libations from full cups. Unless we choose To look back to the hills behind us spread, The plains before us sadden and confuse; If orphaned, we are disinherited. I would but turn these lachrymals to use, And pour fresh oil in from the olive-grove, To furnish them as new lamps. Shall I say What made my heart beat with exulting love A few weeks back?— The day was such a day As Florence owes the sun. The sky above, Its weight upon the mountains seemed to lay, And palpitate in glory, like a dove Who has flown too fast, full-hearted—take away The image! for the heart of man beat higher That day in Florence, flooding all her streets And piazzas with a tumult and desire. The people, with accumulated heats And faces turned one way, as if one fire Both drew and flushed them, left their ancient beats And went up toward the palace-Pitti wall To thank their Grand-duke who, not quite of course, Had graciously permitted, at their call, The citizens to use their civic force To guard their civic homes. So, one and all, The Tuscan cities streamed up to the source Of this new good at Florence, taking it As good so far, presageful of more good,— The first torch of Italian freedom, lit To toss in the next tiger's face who should Approach too near them in a greedy fit,— The first pulse of an even flow of blood To prove the level of Italian veins Towards rights perceived and granted. How we gazed From Casa Guidi windows while, in trains Of orderly procession—banners raised, And intermittent bursts of martial strains Which died upon the shout, as if amazed By gladness beyond music—they passed on! The Magistracy, with insignia, passed,— And all the people shouted in the sun, And all the thousand windows which had cast A ripple of silks in blue and scarlet down (As if the houses overflowed at last), Seemed growing larger with fair heads and eyes. The Lawyers passed,—and still arose the shout, And hands broke from the windows to surprise Those grave calm brows with bay-tree leaves thrown out. The Priesthood passed,—the friars with worldly-wise Keen sidelong glances from their beards about The street to see who shouted; many a monk Who takes a long rope in the waist, was there: Whereat the popular exultation drunk With indrawn “vivas” the whole sunny air, While through the murmuring windows rose and sunk A cloud of kerchiefed hands,—“The church makes fair Her welcome in the new Pope's name.” Ensued The black sign of the “Martyrs”—(name no name, But count the graves in silence). Next were viewed The Artists; next, the Trades; and after came The People,—flag and sign, and rights as good— And very loud the shout was for that same Motto, “Il popolo.” Il Popolo,— The word means dukedom, empire, majesty, And kings in such an hour might read it so. And next, with banners, each in his degree, Deputed representatives a-row Of every separate state of Tuscany: Siena's she-wolf, bristling on the fold Of the first flag, preceded Pisa's hare, And Massa's lion floated calm in gold, Pienza's following with his silver stare, Arezzo's steed pranced clear from bridle-hold,— And well might shout our Florence, greeting there These, and more brethren. Last, the world had sent The various children of her teeming flanks— Greeks, English, French—as if to a parliament Of lovers of her Italy in ranks, Each bearing its land's symbol reverent; At which the stones seemed breaking into thanks And rattling up the sky, such sounds in proof Arose; the very house-walls seemed to bend; The very windows, up from door to roof, Flashed out a rapture of bright heads, to mend With passionate looks the gesture's whirling off A hurricane of leaves. Three hours did end While all these passed; and ever in the crowd, Rude men, unconscious of the tears that kept Their beards moist, shouted; some few laughed aloud, And none asked any why they laughed and wept: Friends kissed each other's cheeks, and foes long vowed More warmly did it; two-months' babies leapt Right upward in their mother's arms, whose black Wide glittering eyes looked elsewhere; lovers pressed Each before either, neither glancing back; And peasant maidens smoothly 'tired and tressed Forgot to finger on their throats the slack Great pearl-strings; while old blind men would not rest, But pattered with their staves and slid their shoes Along the stones, and smiled as if they saw. O heaven, I think that day had noble use Among God's days! So near stood Right and Law, Both mutually forborne! Law would not bruise Nor Right deny, and each in reverent awe Honoured the other. And if, ne'ertheless, That good day's sun delivered to the vines No charta, and the liberal Duke's excess Did scarce exceed a Guelfs or Ghibelline's In any special actual righteousness Of what that day he granted, still the signs Are good and full of promise, we must say, When multitudes approach their kings with prayers And kings concede their people's right to pray Both in one sunshine. Griefs are not despairs, So uttered, nor can royal claims dismay When men from humble homes and ducal chairs Hate wrong together. It was well to view Those banners ruffled in a ruler's face Inscribed, “Live freedom, union, and all true Brave patriots who are aided by God's grace!” Nor was it ill when Leopoldo drew His little children to the window-place He stood in at the Pitti, to suggest They too should govern as the people willed. What a cry rose then! some, who saw the best, Declared his eyes filled up and overfilled With good warm human tears which unrepressed Ran down. I like his face; the forehead's build Has no capacious genius, yet perhaps Sufficient comprehension,—mild and sad, And careful nobly,—not with care that wraps Self-loving hearts, to stifle and make mad, But careful with the care that shuns a lapse Of faith and duty, studious not to add A burden in the gathering of a gain. And so, God save the Duke, I say with those Who that day shouted it; and while dukes reign, May all wear in the visible overflows Of spirit, such a look of careful pain! For God must love it better than repose. And all the people who went up to let Their hearts out to that Duke, as has been told— Where guess ye that the living people met, Kept tryst, formed ranks, chose leaders, first unrolled Their banners? In the Loggia? where is set Cellini's godlike Perseus, bronze or gold, (How name the metal, when the statue flings Its soul so in your eyes?) with brow and sword Superbly calm, as all opposing things, Slain with the Gorgon, were no more abhorred Since ended? No, the people sought no wings From Perseus in the Loggia, nor implored An inspiration in the place beside From that dim bust of Brutus, jagged and grand, Where Buonarroti passionately tried From out the close-clenched marble to demand The head of Rome's sublimest homicide, Then dropt the quivering mallet from his hand, Despairing he could find no model-stuff Of Brutus in all Florence where he found The gods and gladiators thick enough. Nor there! the people chose still holier ground: The people, who are simple, blind and rough, Know their own angels, after looking round. Whom chose they then? where met they? On the stone Called Dante's,—a plain flat stone scarce discerned From others in the pavement,—whereupon He used to bring his quiet chair out, turned To Brunelleschi's church, and pour alone The lava of his spirit when it burned: It is not cold to-day. O passionate Poor Dante who, a banished Florentine, Didst sit austere at banquets of the great And muse upon this far-off stone of thine And think how oft some passer used to wait A moment, in the golden day's decline, With “Good night, dearest Dante!”—well, good night! I muse now, Dante, and think verily, Though chapelled in the byeway out of sight, Ravenna's bones would thrill with ecstasy, Couldst know thy favourite stone's elected right As tryst-place for thy Tuscans to foresee Their earliest chartas from. Good night, good morn, Henceforward, Dante! now my soul is sure That thine is better comforted of scorn, And looks down earthward in completer cure Than when, in Santa Croce church forlorn Of any corpse, the architect and hewer Did pile the empty marbles as thy tomb. The Florentines, to whom the Ravennese refused the body of Dante (demanded of them “in a late remorse of love”), have given a cenotaph in this church to their divine poet. Something less than a grave! For now thou art no longer exiled, now Best honoured: we salute thee who art come Back to the old stone with a softer brow Than Giotto drew upon the wall, for some Good lovers of our age to track and plough In allusion to Mr. Kirkup's discovery of Giotto's fresco portrait of Dante. Their way to, through time's ordures stratified, And startle broad awake into the dull Bargello chamber: now thou'rt milder-eyed,— Now Beatrix may leap up glad to cull Thy first smile, even in heaven and at her side, Like that which, nine years old, looked beautiful At May-game. What do I say? I only meant That tender Dante loved his Florence well, While Florence, now, to love him is content; And, mark ye, that the piercingest sweet smell Of love's dear incense by the living sent To find the dead, is not accessible To lazy livers—no narcotic,—not Swung in a censer to a sleepy tune,— But trod out in the morning air by hot Quick spirits who tread firm to ends foreshown, And use the name of greatness unforgot, To meditate what greatness may be done. For Dante sits in heaven and ye stand here, And more remains for doing, all must feel, Than trysting on his stone from year to year To shift processions, civic toe to heel, The town's thanks to the Pitti. Are ye freer For what was felt that day? a chariot-wheel May spin fast, yet the chariot never roll. But if that day suggested something good, And bettered, with one purpose, soul by soul,— Better means freer. A land's brotherhood Is most puissant: men, upon the whole, Are what they can be,—nations, what they would. Will, therefore, to be strong, thou Italy! Will to be noble! Austrian Metternich Can fix no yoke unless the neck agree; And thine is like the lion's when the thick Dews shudder from it, and no man would be The stroker of his mane, much less would prick His nostril with a reed. When nations roar Like lions, who shall tame them and defraud Of the due pasture by the river-shore? Roar, therefore! shake your dewlaps dry abroad: The amphitheatre with open door Leads back upon the benches who applaud The last spear-thruster. Yet the Heavens forbid That we should call on passion to confront The brutal with the brutal and, amid This ripening world, suggest a lion-hunt And lion's-vengeance for the wrongs men did And do now, though the spears are getting blunt. We only call, because the sight and proof Of lion-strength hurts nothing; and to show A lion-heart, and measure paw with hoof, Helps something, even, and will instruct a foe As well as the onslaught, how to stand aloof: Or else the world gets past the mere brute blow Or given or taken. Children use the fist Until they are of age to use the brain; And so we needed Cæsars to assist Man's justice, and Napoleons to explain God's counsel, when a point was nearly missed, Until our generations should attain Christ's stature nearer. Not that we, alas, Attain already; but a single inch Will raise to look down on the swordsman's pass, As knightly Roland on the coward's flinch: And, after chloroform and ether-gas, We find out slowly what the bee and finch Have ready found, through Nature's lamp in each, How to our races we may justify Our individual claims and, as we reach Our own grapes, bend the top vines to supply The children's uses,—how to fill a breach With olive-branches,—how to quench a lie With truth, and smite a foe upon the cheek With Christ's most conquering kiss. Why, these are things Worth a great nation's finding, to prove weak The “glorious arms” of military kings. And so with wide embrace, my England, seek To stifle the bad heat and flickerings Of this world's false and nearly expended fire! Draw palpitating arrows to the wood, And twang abroad thy high hopes and thy higher Resolves, from that most virtuous altitude! Till nations shall unconsciously aspire By looking up to thee, and learn that good And glory are not different. Announce law By freedom; exalt chivalry by peace; Instruct how clear calm eyes can overawe, And how pure hands, stretched simply to release A bond-slave, will not need a sword to draw To be held dreadful. O my England, crease Thy purple with no alien agonies, No struggles toward encroachment, no vile war! Disband thy captains, change thy victories, Be henceforth prosperous as the angels are; Helping, not humbling. Drums and battle-cries Go out in music of the morning-star— And soon we shall have thinkers in the place Of fighters, each found able as a man To strike electric influence through a race, Unstayed by city-wall and barbican. The poet shall look grander in the face Than even of old (when he of Greece began To sing “that Achillean wrath which slew So many heroes”)—seeing he shall treat The deeds of souls heroic toward the true, The oracles of life, previsions sweet And awful like divine swans gliding through White arms of Ledas, which will leave the heat Of their escaping godship to endue The human medium with a heavenly flush. Meanwhile, in this same Italy we want Not popular passion, to arise and crush, But popular conscience, which may covenant For what it knows. Concede without a blush, To grant the “civic guard” is not to grant The civic spirit, living and awake: Those lappets on your shoulders, citizens, Your eyes strain after sideways till they ache (While still, in admirations and amens, The crowd comes up on festa-days to take The great sight in)—are not intelligence, Not courage even—alas, if not the sign Of something very noble, they are nought; For every day ye dress your sallow kine With fringes down their cheeks, though unbesought They loll their heavy heads and drag the wine And bear the wooden yoke as they were taught The first day. What ye want is light—indeed Not sunlight—(ye may well look up surprised To those unfathomable heavens that feed Your purple hills)—but God's light organised In some high soul, crowned capable to lead The conscious people, conscious and advised,— For if we lift a people like mere clay, It falls the same. We want thee, O unfound And sovran teacher! if thy beard be grey Or black, we bid thee rise up from the ground And speak the word God giveth thee to say, Inspiring into all this people round, Instead of passion, thought, which pioneers All generous passion, purifies from sin, And strikes the hour for. Rise up, teacher! here's A crowd to make a nation!—best begin By making each a man, till all be peers Of earth's true patriots and pure martyrs in Knowing and daring. Best unbar the doors Which Peter's heirs keep locked so overclose They only let the mice across the floors, While every churchman dangles, as he goes, The great key at his girdle, and abhors In Christ's name, meekly. Open wide the house, Concede the entrance with Christ's liberal mind, And set the tables with His wine and bread. What! “commune in both kinds?” In every kind— Wine, wafer, love, hope, truth, unlimited, Nothing kept back. For when a man is blind To starlight, will he see the rose is red? A bondsman shivering at a Jesuit's foot— “Væ! meâ culpâ!”—is not like to stand A freedman at a despot's and dispute His titles by the balance in his hand, Weighing them “suo jure.” Tend the root If careful of the branches, and expand The inner souls of men before you strive For civic heroes. But the teacher, where? From all these crowded faces, all alive, Eyes, of their own lids flashing themselves bare, And brows that with a mobile life contrive A deeper shadow,—may we in no wise dare To put a finger out and touch a man, And cry “this is the leader”? What, all these! Broad heads, black eyes,—yet not a soul that ran From God down with a message? All, to please The donna waving measures with her fan, And not the judgment-angel on his knees (The trumpet just an inch off from his lips), Who when he breathes next, will put out the sun? Yet mankind's self were foundered in eclipse, If lacking doers, with great works to be done; And lo, the startled earth already dips Back into light; a better day's begun; And soon this leader, teacher, will stand plain, And build the golden pipes and synthesize This people-organ for a holy strain. We hold this hope, and still in all these eyes Go sounding for the deep look which shall drain Suffused thought into channelled enterprise. Where is the teacher? What now may he do, Who shall do greatly? Doth he gird his waist With a monk's rope, like Luther? or pursue The goat, like Tell? or dry his nets in haste, Like Masaniello when the sky was blue? Keep house, like other peasants, with inlaced Bare brawny arms about a favourite child, And meditative looks beyond the door (But not to mark the kidling's teeth have filed The green shoots of his vine which last year bore Full twenty bunches), or, on triple-piled Throne-velvets sit at ease to bless the poor, Like other pontiffs, in the Poorest's name? The old tiara keeps itself aslope Upon his steady brows which, all the same, Bend mildly to permit the people's hope? Whatever hand shall grasp this oriflamme, Whatever man (last peasant or first pope Seeking to free his country) shall appear, Teach, lead, strike fire into the masses, fill These empty bladders with fine air, insphere These wills into a unity of will, And make of Italy a nation—dear And blessed be that man! the Heavens shall kill No leaf the earth lets grow for him, and Death Shall cast him back upon the lap of Life To live more surely, in a clarion-breath Of hero-music. Brutus with the knife, Rienzi with the fasces, throb beneath Rome's stones,—and more who threw away joy's fife Like Pallas, that the beauty of their souls Might ever shine untroubled and entire: But if it can be true that he who rolls The Church's thunders will reserve her fire For only light,—from eucharistic bowls Will pour new life for nations that expire, And rend the scarlet of his papal vest To gird the weak loins of his countrymen,— I hold that he surpasses all the rest Of Romans, heroes, patriots; and that when He sat down on the throne, he dispossessed The first graves of some glory. See again, This country-saving is a glorious thing: And if a common man achieved it? well. Say, a rich man did? excellent. A king? That grows sublime. A priest? improbable. A pope? Ah, there we stop, and cannot bring Our faith up to the leap, with history's bell So heavy round the neck of it—albeit We fain would grant the possibility For thy sake, Pio Nono! Stretch thy feet In that case—I will kiss them reverently As any pilgrim to the papal seat: And, such proved possible, thy throne to me Shall seem as holy a place as Pellico's Venetian dungeon, or as Spielberg's grate At which the Lombard woman hung the rose Of her sweet soul by its own dewy weight, To feel the dungeon round her sunshine close, And pining so, died early, yet too late For what she suffered. Yea, I will not choose Betwixt thy throne, Pope Pius, and the spot Marked red for ever, spite of rains and dews, Where Two fell riddled by the Austrian's shot, The brothers Bandiera, who accuse, With one same mother-voice and face (that what They speak may be invincible) the sins Of earth's tormentors before God the just, Until the unconscious thunderbolt begins To loosen in His grasp. And yet we must Beware, and mark the natural kiths and kins Of circumstance and office, and distrust The rich man reasoning in a poor man's hut, The poet who neglects pure truth to prove Statistic fact, the child who leaves a rut For a smoother road, the priest who vows his glove Exhales no grace, the prince who walks afoot, The woman who has sworn she will not love, And this Ninth Pius in Seventh Gregory's chair, With Andrea Doria's forehead! Count what goes To making up a pope, before he wear That triple crown. We pass the world-wide throes Which went to make the popedom,—the despair Of free men, good men, wise men; the dread shows Of women's faces, by the faggot's flash Tossed out, to the minutest stir and throb O' the white lips, the least tremble of a lash, To glut the red stare of a licensed mob; The short mad cries down oubliettes, and plash So horribly far off; priests, trained to rob, And kings that, like encouraged nightmares, sat On nations' hearts most heavily distressed With monstrous sights and apophthegms of fate— We pass these things,—because “the times” are prest With necessary charges of the weight Of all this sin, and “Calvin, for the rest, Made bold to burn Servetus. Ah, men err!”— And so do churches! which is all we mean To bring to proof in any register Of theological fat kine and lean: So drive them back into the pens! refer Old sins (with pourpoint, “quotha” and “I ween”) Entirely to the old times, the old times; Nor ever ask why this preponderant Infallible pure Church could set her chimes Most loudly then, just then,—most jubilant, Precisely then, when mankind stood in crimes Full heart-deep, and Heaven's judgments were not scant. Inquire still less, what signifies a church Of perfect inspiration and pure laws Who burns the first man with a brimstone-torch, And grinds the second, bone by bone, because The times, forsooth, are used to rack and scorch! What is a holy Church unless she awes The times down from their sins? Did Christ select Such amiable times to come and teach Love to, and mercy? The whole world were wrecked If every mere great man, who lives to reach A little leaf of popular respect, Attained not simply by some special breach In the age's customs, by some precedence In thought and act, which, having proved him higher Than those he lived with, proved his competence In helping them to wonder and aspire. My words are guiltless of the bigot's sense; My soul has fire to mingle with the fire Of all these souls, within or out of doors Of Rome's church or another. I believe In one Priest, and one temple with its floors Of shining jasper gloom'd at morn and eve By countless knees of earnest auditors, And crystal walls too lucid to perceive, That none may take the measure of the place And say “So far the porphyry, then, the flint— To this mark mercy goes, and there ends grace,” Though still the permeable crystals hint At some white starry distance, bathed in space. I feel how nature's ice-crusts keep the dint Of undersprings of silent Deity. I hold the articulated gospels which Show Christ among us crucified on tree. I love all who love truth, if poor or rich In what they have won of truth possessively. No altars and no hands defiled with pitch Shall scare me off, but I will pray and eat With all these—taking leave to choose my ewers— And say at last “Your visible churches cheat Their inward types; and, if a church assures Of standing without failure and defeat, The same both fails and lies.” To leave which lures Of wider subject through past years,—behold, We come back from the popedom to the pope, To ponder what he must be, ere we are bold For what he may be, with our heavy hope To trust upon his soul. So, fold by fold, Explore this mummy in the priestly cope, Transmitted through the darks of time, to catch The man within the wrappage, and discern How he, an honest man, upon the watch Full fifty years for what a man may learn, Contrived to get just there; with what a snatch Of old-world oboli he had to earn The passage through; with what a drowsy sop, To drench the busy barkings of his brain; What ghosts of pale tradition, wreathed with hope 'Gainst wakeful thought, he had to entertain For heavenly visions; and consent to stop The clock at noon, and let the hour remain (Without vain windings-up) inviolate Against all chimings from the belfry. Lo, From every given pope you must abate, Albeit you love him, some things—good, you know— Which every given heretic you hate, Assumes for his, as being plainly so. A pope must hold by popes a little,—yes, By councils, from Nicæa up to Trent,— By hierocratic empire, more or less Irresponsible to men,—he must resent Each man's particular conscience, and repress Inquiry, meditation, argument, As tyrants faction. Also, he must not Love truth too dangerously, but prefer “The interests of the Church” (because a blot Is better than a rent, in miniver)— Submit to see the people swallow hot Husk-porridge, which his chartered churchmen stir Quoting the only true God's epigraph, “Feed my lambs, Peter!”—must consent to sit Attesting with his pastoral ring and staff To such a picture of our Lady, hit Off well by artist-angels (though not half As fair as Giotto would have painted it)— To such a vial, where a dead man's blood Runs yearly warm beneath a churchman's finger,— To such a holy house of stone and wood, Whereof a cloud of angels was the bringer From Bethlehem to Loreto. Were it good For any pope on earth to be a flinger Of stones against these high-niched counterfeits? Apostates only are iconoclasts. He dares not say, while this false thing abets That true thing, “This is false.” He keeps his fasts And prayers, as prayer and fast were silver frets To change a note upon a string that lasts, And make a lie a virtue. Now, if he Did more than this, higher hoped, and braver dared, I think he were a pope in jeopardy, Or no pope rather, for his truth had barred The vaulting of his life,—and certainly, If he do only this, mankind's regard Moves on from him at once, to seek some new Teacher and leader. He is good and great According to the deeds a pope can do; Most liberal, save those bonds; affectionate, As princes may be, and, as priests are, true; But only the Ninth Pius after eight, When all's praised most. At best and hopefullest, He's pope—we want a man! his heart beats warm, But, like the prince enchanted to the waist, He sits in stone and hardens by a charm Into the marble of his throne high-placed. Mild benediction waves his saintly arm— So, good! but what we want's a perfect man, Complete and all alive: half travertine Half suits our need, and ill subserves our plan. Feet, knees, nerves, sinews, energies divine Were never yet too much for men who ran In such hard ways as must be this of thine, Deliverer whom we seek, whoe'er thou art, Pope, prince, or peasant! If, indeed, the first, The noblest, therefore! since the heroic heart Within thee must be great enough to burst Those trammels buckling to the baser part Thy saintly peers in Rome, who crossed and cursed With the same finger. Come, appear, be found, If pope or peasant, come! we hear the cock, The courtier of the mountains when first crowned With golden dawn; and orient glories flock To meet the sun upon the highest ground. Take voice and work! we wait to hear thee knock At some one of our Florentine nine gates, On each of which was imaged a sublime Face of a Tuscan genius, which, for hate's And love's sake, both, our Florence in her prime Turned boldly on all comers to her states, As heroes turned their shields in antique time Emblazoned with honourable acts. And though The gates are blank now of such images, And Petrarch looks no more from Nicolo Toward dear Arezzo, 'twixt the acacia-trees, Nor Dante, from gate Gallo—still we know, Despite the razing of the blazonries, Remains the consecration of the shield: The dead heroic faces will start out On all these gates, if foes should take the field, And blend sublimely, at the earliest shout, With living heroes who will scorn to yield A hair's-breadth even, when, gazing round about, They find in what a glorious company They fight the foes of Florence. Who will grudge His one poor life, when that great man we see Has given five hundred years, the world being judge, To help the glory of his Italy? Who, born the fair side of the Alps, will budge, When Dante stays, when Ariosto stays, When Petrarch stays for ever? Ye bring swords, My Tuscans? Ay, if wanted in this haze, Bring swords: but first bring souls!—bring thoughts and words, Unrusted by a tear of yesterday's, Yet awful by its wrong,—and cut these cords, And mow this green lush falseness to the roots, And shut the mouth of hell below the swathe! And, if ye can bring songs too, let the lute's Recoverable music softly bathe Some poet's hand, that, through all bursts and bruits Of popular passion, all unripe and rathe Convictions of the popular intellect, Ye may not lack a finger up the air, Annunciative, reproving, pure, erect, To show which way your first Ideal bare The whiteness of its wings when (sorely pecked By falcons on your wrists) it unaware Arose up overhead and out of sight. Meanwhile, let all the far ends of the world Breathe back the deep breath of their old delight, To swell the Italian banner just unfurled. Help, lands of Europe! for, if Austria fight, The drums will bar your slumber. Had ye curled The laurel for your thousand artists' brows, If these Italian hands had planted none? Can any sit down idle in the house Nor hear appeals from Buonarroti's stone And Raffael's canvas, rousing and to rouse? Where's Poussin's master? Gallic Avignon Bred Laura, and Vaucluse's fount has stirred The heart of France too strongly, as it lets Its little stream out (like a wizard's bird Which bounds upon its emerald wing and wets The rocks on each side), that she should not gird Her loins with Charlemagne's sword when foes beset The country of her Petrarch. Spain may well Be minded how from Italy she caught, To mingle with her tinkling Moorish bell, A fuller cadence and a subtler thought. And even the New World, the receptacle Of freemen, may send glad men, as it ought, To greet Vespucci Amerigo's door. While England claims, by trump of poetry, Verona, Venice, the Ravenna-shore, And dearer holds John Milton's Fiesole Than Langland's Malvern with the stars in flower. And Vallombrosa, we two went to see Last June, beloved companion,—where sublime The mountains live in holy families, And the slow pinewoods ever climb and climb Half up their breasts, just stagger as they seize Some grey crag, drop back with it many a time, And straggle blindly down the precipice. The Vallombrosan brooks were strewn as thick That June-day, knee-deep with dead beechen leaves, As Milton saw them ere his heart grew sick And his eyes blind. I think the monks and beeves Are all the same too: scarce have they changed the wick On good Saint Gualbert's altar which receives The convent's pilgrims; and the pool in front (Wherein the hill-stream trout are cast, to wait The beatific vision and the grunt Used at refectory) keeps its weedy state, To baffle saintly abbots who would count The fish across their breviary nor 'bate The measure of their steps. O waterfalls And forests! sound and silence! mountains bare That leap up peak by peak and catch the palls Of purple and silver mist to rend and share With one another, at electric calls Of life in the sunbeams,—till we cannot dare Fix your shapes, count your number! we must think Your beauty and your glory helped to fill The cup of Milton's soul so to the brink, He never more was thirsty when God's will Had shattered to his sense the last chain-link By which he had drawn from Nature's visible The fresh well-water. Satisfied by this, He sang of Adam's paradise and smiled, Remembering Vallombrosa. Therefore is The place divine to English man and child, And pilgrims leave their souls here in a kiss. For Italy's the whole earth's treasury, piled With reveries of gentle ladies, flung Aside, like ravelled silk, from life's worn stuff; With coins of scholars' fancy, which, being rung On work-day counter, still sound silver-proof; In short, with all the dreams of dreamers young, Before their heads have time for slipping off Hope's pillow to the ground. How oft, indeed, We've sent our souls out from the rigid north, On bare white feet which would not print nor bleed, To climb the Alpine passes and look forth, Where booming low the Lombard rivers lead To gardens, vineyards, all a dream is worth,— Sights, thou and I, Love, have seen afterward From Tuscan Bellosguardo, wide awake, Galileo's villa, close to Florence, is built on an eminence called Bellosguardo. When, standing on the actual blessed sward Where Galileo stood at nights to take The vision of the stars, we have found it hard, Gazing upon the earth and heaven, to make A choice of beauty. Therefore let us all Refreshed in England or in other land, By visions, with their fountain-rise and fall, Of this earth's darling,—we, who understand A little how the Tuscan musical Vowels do round themselves as if they planned Eternities of separate sweetness,—we, Who loved Sorrento vines in picture-book, Or ere in wine-cup we pledged faith or glee,— Who loved Rome's wolf with demi-gods at suck, Or ere we loved truth's own divinity,— Who loved, in brief, the classic hill and brook, And Ovid's dreaming tales and Petrarch's song, Or ere we loved Love's self even,—let us give The blessing of our souls (and wish them strong To bear it to the height where prayers arrive, When faithful spirits pray against a wrong,) To this great cause of southern men who strive In God's name for man's rights, and shall not fail. Behold, they shall not fail. The shouts ascend Above the shrieks, in Naples, and prevail. Rows of shot corpses, waiting for the end Of burial, seem to smile up straight and pale Into the azure air and apprehend That final gun-flash from Palermo's coast Which lightens their apocalypse of death. So let them die! The world shows nothing lost; Therefore, not blood. Above or underneath, What matter, brothers, if ye keep your post On duty's side? As sword returns to sheath, So dust to grave, but souls find place in Heaven. Heroic daring is the true success, The eucharistic bread requires no leaven; And though your ends were hopeless, we should bless Your cause as holy. Strive—and, having striven, Take, for God's recompense, that righteousness! PART II. I wrote a meditation and a dream, Hearing a little child sing in the street: I leant upon his music as a theme, Till it gave way beneath my heart's full beat Which tried at an exultant prophecy But dropped before the measure was complete— Alas, for songs and hearts! O Tuscany, O Dante's Florence, is the type too plain? Didst thou, too, only sing of liberty As little children take up a high strain With unintentioned voices, and break off To sleep upon their mothers' knees again? Couldst thou not watch one hour? then, sleep enough— That sleep may hasten manhood and sustain The faint pale spirit with some muscular stuff. But we, who cannot slumber as thou dost, We thinkers, who have thought for thee and failed, We hopers, who have hoped for thee and lost, We poets, wandered round by dreams, See the opening passage of the “Agamemnon” of Æschylus. who hailed From this Atrides' roof (with lintel-post Which still drips blood,—the worse part hath prevailed) The fire-voice of the beacons to declare Troy taken, sorrow ended,—cozened through A crimson sunset in a misty air, What now remains for such as we, to do? God's judgments, peradventure, will He bare To the roots of thunder, if we kneel and sue? From Casa Guidi windows I looked forth, And saw ten thousand eyes of Florentines Flash back the triumph of the Lombard north,— Saw fifty banners, freighted with the signs And exultations of the awakened earth, Float on above the multitude in lines, Straight to the Pitti. So, the vision went. And so, between those populous rough hands Raised in the sun, Duke Leopold outleant, And took the patriot's oath which henceforth stands Among the oaths of perjurers, eminent To catch the lightnings ripened for these lands. Why swear at all, thou false Duke Leopold? What need to swear? What need to boast thy blood Unspoilt of Austria, and thy heart unsold Away from Florence? It was understood God made thee not too vigorous or too bold; And men had patience with thy quiet mood, And women, pity, as they saw thee pace Their festive streets with premature grey hairs. We turned the mild dejection of thy face To princely meanings, took thy wrinkling cares For ruffling hopes, and called thee weak, not base. Nay, better light the torches for more prayers And smoke the pale Madonnas at the shrine, Being still “our poor Grand-duke, our good Grand-duke, Who cannot help the Austrian in his line,”— Than write an oath upon a nation's book For men to spit at with scorn's blurring brine! Who dares forgive what none can overlook? For me, I do repent me in this dust Of towns and temples which makes Italy,— I sigh amid the sighs which breathe a gust Of dying century to century Around us on the uneven crater-crust Of these old worlds,—I bow my soul and knee. Absolve me, patriots, of my woman's fault That ever I believed the man was true! These sceptred strangers shun the common salt, And, therefore, when the general board's in view And they stand up to carve for blind and halt, The wise suspect the viands which ensue. I much repent that, in this time and place Where many corpse-lights of experience burn From Cæsar's and Lorenzo's festering race, To enlighten groping reasoners, I could learn No better counsel for a simple case Than to put faith in princes, in my turn. Had all the death-piles of the ancient years Flared up in vain before me? knew I not What stench arises from some purple gears? And how the sceptres witness whence they got Their briar-wood, crackling through the atmosphere's Foul smoke, by princely perjuries, kept hot? Forgive me, ghosts of patriots,—Brutus, thou, Who trailest downhill into life again Thy blood-weighed cloak, to indict me with thy slow Reproachful eyes!—for being taught in vain That, while the illegitimate Cæsars show Of meaner stature than the first full strain (Confessed incompetent to conquer Gaul), They swoon as feebly and cross Rubicons As rashly as any Julius of them all! Forgive, that I forgot the mind which runs Through absolute races, too unsceptical! I saw the man among his little sons, His lips were warm with kisses while he swore; And I, because I am a woman—I, Who felt my own child's coming life before The prescience of my soul, and held faith high,— I could not bear to think, whoever bore, That lips, so warmed, could shape so cold a lie. From Casa Guidi windows I looked out, Again looked, and beheld a different sight. The Duke had fled before the people's shout “Long live the Duke!” A people, to speak right, Must speak as soft as courtiers, lest a doubt Should curdle brows of gracious sovereigns, white. Moreover that same dangerous shouting meant Some gratitude for future favours, which Were only promised, the Constituent Implied, the whole being subject to the hitch In “motu proprios,” very incident To all these Czars, from Paul to Paulovitch. Whereat the people rose up in the dust Of the ruler's flying feet, and shouted still And loudly; only, this time, as was just, Not “Live the Duke,” who had fled for good or ill, But “Live the People,” who remained and must, The unrenounced and unrenounceable. Long live the people! How they lived! and boiled And bubbled in the cauldron of the street: How the young blustered, nor the old recoiled, And what a thunderous stir of tongues and feet Trod flat the palpitating bells and foiled The joy-guns of their echo, shattering it! How down they pulled the Duke's arms everywhere! How up they set new café-signs, to show Where patriots might sip ices in pure air— (The fresh paint smelling somewhat)! To and fro How marched the civic guard, and stopped to stare When boys broke windows in a civic glow! How rebel songs were sung to loyal tunes, And bishops cursed in ecclesiastic metres: How all the Circoli grew large as moons, And all the speakers, moonstruck,—thankful greeters Of prospects which struck poor the ducal boons, A mere free Press, and Chambers!—frank repeaters Of great Guerazzi's praises—“There's a man, The father of the land, who, truly great, Takes off that national disgrace and ban, The farthing tax upon our Florence-gate, And saves Italia as he only can!” How all the nobles fled, and would not wait, Because they were most noble,—which being so, How Liberals vowed to burn their palaces, Because free Tuscans were not free to go! How grown men raged at Austria's wickedness, And smoked,—while fifty striplings in a row Marched straight to Piedmont for the wrong's redress! You say we failed in duty, we who wore Black velvet like Italian democrats, Who slashed our sleeves like patriots, nor forswore The true republic in the form of hats? We chased the archbishop from the Duomo door, We chalked the walls with bloody caveats Against all tyrants. If we did not fight Exactly, we fired muskets up the air To show that victory was ours of right. We met, had free discussion everywhere (Except perhaps i' the Chambers) day and night. We proved the poor should be employed, . . . that's fair,— And yet the rich not worked for anywise,— Pay certified, yet payers abrogated,— Full work secured, yet liabilities To overwork excluded,—not one bated Of all our holidays, that still, at twice Or thrice a week, are moderately rated. We proved that Austria was dislodged, or would Or should be, and that Tuscany in arms Should, would dislodge her, ending the old feud; And yet, to leave our piazzas, shops, and farms, For the simple sake of fighting, was not good— We proved that also. “Did we carry charms Against being killed ourselves, that we should rush On killing others? what, desert herewith Our wives and mothers?—was that duty? tush!” At which we shook the sword within the sheath Like heroes—only louder; and the flush Ran up the cheek and to meet the future wreath. Nay, what we proved, we shouted—how we shouted (Especially the boys did), boldly planting That tree of liberty, whose fruit is doubted, Because the roots are not of nature's granting! A tree of good and evil: none, without it, Grow gods; alas and, with it, men are wanting! O holy knowledge, holy liberty, O holy rights of nations! If I speak These bitter things against the jugglery Of days that in your names proved blind and weak, It is that tears are bitter. When we see The brown skulls grin at death in churchyards bleak, We do not cry “This Yorick is too light,” For death grows deathlier with that mouth he makes. So with my mocking: bitter things I write Because my soul is bitter for your sakes, O freedom! O my Florence! Men who might Do greatly in a universe that breaks And burns, must ever know before they do. Courage and patience are but sacrifice; And sacrifice is offered for and to Something conceived of. Each man pays a price For what himself counts precious, whether true Or false the appreciation it implies. But here,—no knowledge, no conception, nought! Desire was absent, that provides great deeds From out the greatness of prevenient thought: And action, action, like a flame that needs A steady breath and fuel, being caught Up, like a burning reed from other reeds, Flashed in the empty and uncertain air, Then wavered, then went out. Behold, who blames A crooked course, when not a goal is there To round the fervid striving of the games? An ignorance of means may minister To greatness, but an ignorance of aims Makes it impossible to be great at all. So with our Tuscans! Let none dare to say, “Here virtue never can be national; Here fortitude can never cut a way Between the Austrian muskets, out of thrall: I tell you rather that, whoever may Discern true ends here, shall grow pure enough To love them, brave enough to strive for them, And strong to reach them though the roads be rough: That having learnt—by no mere apophthegm— Not just the draping of a graceful stuff About a statue, broidered at the hem,— Not just the trilling on an opera-stage Of “libertà” to bravos—(a fair word, Yet too allied to inarticulate rage And breathless sobs, for singing, though the chord Were deeper than they struck it) but the gauge Of civil wants sustained and wrongs abhorred, The serious sacred meaning and full use Of freedom for a nation,—then, indeed, Our Tuscans, underneath the bloody dews Of some new morning, rising up agreed And bold, will want no Saxon souls or thews To sweep their piazzas clear of Austria's breed. Alas, alas! it was not so this time. Conviction was not, courage failed, and truth Was something to be doubted of. The mime Changed masks, because a mime. The tide as smooth In running in as out, no sense of crime Because no sense of virtue,—sudden ruth Seized on the people: they would have again Their good Grand-duke and leave Guerazzi, though He took that tax from Florence. “Much in vain He takes it from the market-carts, we trow, While urgent that no market-men remain, But all march off and leave the spade and plough, To die among the Lombards. Was it thus The dear paternal Duke did? Live the Duke!” At which the joy-bells multitudinous, Swept by an opposite wind, as loudly shook. Call back the mild archbishop to his house, To bless the people with his frightened look,— He shall not yet be hanged, you comprehend! Seize on Guerazzi; guard him in full view, Or else we stab him in the back, to end! Rub out those chalked devices, set up new The Duke's arms, doff your Phrygian caps, and mend The pavement of the piazzas broke into By barren poles of freedom: smooth the way For the ducal carriage, lest his highness sigh “Here trees of liberty grew yesterday!” “Long live the Duke!”—how roared the cannonry, How rocked the bell-towers, and through thickening spray Of nosegays, wreaths, and kerchiefs tossed on high, How marched the civic guard, the people still Being good at shouts, especially the boys! Alas, poor people, of an unfledged will Most fitly expressed by such a callow voice! Alas, still poorer Duke, incapable Of being worthy even of so much noise! You think he came back instantly, with thanks And tears in his faint eyes, and hands extended To stretch the franchise through their utmost ranks? That having, like a father, apprehended, He came to pardon fatherly those pranks Played out and now in filial service ended?— That some love-token, like a prince, he threw To meet the people's love-call, in return? Well, how he came I will relate to you; And if your hearts should burn, why, hearts must burn, To make the ashes which things old and new Shall be washed clean in—as this Duke will learn. From Casa Guidi windows gazing, then, I saw and witness how the Duke came back. The regular tramp of horse and tread of men Did smite the silence like an anvil black And sparkless. With her wide eyes at full strain, Our Tuscan nurse exclaimed “Alack, alack, Signora! these shall be the Austrians.” “Nay, Be still,” I answered, “do not wake the child!” —For so, my two-months' baby sleeping lay In milky dreams upon the bed and smiled, And I thought “He shall sleep on, while he may, Through the world's baseness: not being yet defiled, Why should he be disturbed by what is done?” Then, gazing, I beheld the long-drawn street Live out, from end to end, full in the sun, With Austria's thousand; sword and bayonet, Horse, foot, artillery,—cannons rolling on Like blind slow storm-clouds gestant with the heat Of undeveloped lightnings, each bestrode By a single man, dust-white from head to heel, Indifferent as the dreadful thing he rode, Like a sculptured Fate serene and terrible. As some smooth river which has overflowed Will slow and silent down its current wheel A loosened forest, all the pines erect, So swept, in mute significance of storm, The marshalled thousands; not an eye deflect To left or right, to catch a novel form Of Florence city adorned by architect And carver, or of Beauties live and warm Scared at the casements,—all, straightforward eyes And faces, held as steadfast as their swords, And cognisant of acts, not imageries. The key, O Tuscans, too well fits the wards! Ye asked for mimes,—these bring you tragedies: For purple,—these shall wear it as your lords. Ye played like children,—die like innocents. Ye mimicked lightnings with a torch,—the crack Of the actual bolt, your pastime circumvents. Ye called up ghosts, believing they were slack To follow any voice from Gilboa's tents, . . . Here's Samuel!—and, so, Grand-dukes come back! And yet, they are no prophets though they come: That awful mantle, they are drawing close, Shall be searched, one day, by the shafts of Doom Through double folds now hoodwinking the brows. Resuscitated monarchs disentomb Grave-reptiles with them, in their new life-throes. Let such beware. Behold, the people waits, Like God: as He, in His serene of might, So they, in their endurance of long straits. Ye stamp no nation out, though day and night Ye tread them with that absolute heel which grates And grinds them flat from all attempted height. You kill worms sooner with a garden-spade Than you kill peoples: peoples will not die; The tail curls stronger when you lop the head: They writhe at every wound and multiply And shudder into a heap of life that's made Thus vital from God's own vitality. 'Tis hard to shrivel back a day of God's Once fixed for judgment; 'tis as hard to change The peoples, when they rise beneath their loads And heave them from their backs with violent wrench To crush the oppressor: for that judgment-rod's The measure of this popular revenge. Meanwhile, from Casa Guidi windows, we Beheld the armament of Austria flow Into the drowning heart of Tuscany: And yet none wept, none cursed, or, if 'twas so, They wept and cursed in silence. Silently Our noisy Tuscans watched the invading foe; They had learnt silence. Pressed against the wall, And grouped upon the church-steps opposite, A few pale men and women stared at all. God knows what they were feeling, with their white Constrainèd faces, they, so prodigal Of cry and gesture when the world goes right, Or wrong indeed. But here was depth of wrong, And here, still water; they were silent here; And through that sentient silence, struck along That measured tramp from which it stood out clear, Distinct the sound and silence, like a gong At midnight, each by the other awfuller,— While every soldier in his cap displayed A leaf of olive. Dusty, bitter thing! Was such plucked at Novara, is it said? A cry is up in England, which doth ring The hollow world through, that for ends of trade And virtue and God's better worshipping, We henceforth should exalt the name of Peace And leave those rusty wars that eat the soul,— Besides their clippings at our golden fleece. I, too, have loved peace, and from bole to bole Of immemorial undeciduous trees Would write, as lovers use upon a scroll, The holy name of Peace and set it high Where none could pluck it down. On trees, I say,— Not upon gibbets!—With the greenery Of dewy branches and the flowery May, Sweet mediation betwixt earth and sky Providing, for the shepherd's holiday. Not upon gibbets! though the vulture leaves The bones to quiet, which he first picked bare. Not upon dungeons! though the wretch who grieves And groans within less stirs the outer air Than any little field-mouse stirs the sheaves. Not upon chain-bolts! though the slave's despair Has dulled his helpless miserable brain And left him blank beneath the freeman's whip To sing and laugh out idiocies of pain. Nor yet on starving homes! where many a lip Has sobbed itself asleep through curses vain. I love no peace which is not fellowship And which includes not mercy. I would have Rather the raking of the guns across The world, and shrieks against Heaven's architrave; Rather the struggle in the slippery fosse Of dying men and horses, and the wave Blood-bubbling. . . . Enough said!—by Christ's own cross, And by this faint heart of my womanhood, Such things are better than a Peace that sits Beside a hearth in self-commended mood, And takes no thought how wind and rain by fits Are howling out of doors against the good Of the poor wanderer. What! your peace admits Of outside anguish while it keeps at home? I loathe to take its name upon my tongue. 'Tis nowise peace: 'tis treason, stiff with doom,— 'Tis gagged despair and inarticulate wrong,— Annihilated Poland, stifled Rome, Dazed Naples, Hungary fainting 'neath the thong, And Austria wearing a smooth olive-leaf On her brute forehead, while her hoofs outpress The life from these Italian souls, in brief. O Lord of Peace, who art Lord of Righteousness, Constrain the anguished worlds from sin and grief, Pierce them with conscience, purge them with redress, And give us peace which is no counterfeit! But wherefore should we look out any more From Casa Guidi windows? Shut them straight, And let us sit down by the folded door, And veil our saddened faces and, so, wait What next the judgment-heavens make ready for. I have grown too weary of these windows. Sights Come thick enough and clear enough in thought, Without the sunshine; souls have inner lights. And since the Grand-duke has come back and brought This army of the North which thus requites His filial South, we leave him to be taught. His South, too, has learnt something certainly, Whereof the practice will bring profit soon; And peradventure other eyes may see, From Casa Guidi windows, what is done Or undone. Whatsoever deeds they be, Pope Pius will be glorified in none. Record that gain, Mazzini!—it shall top Some heights of sorrow. Peter's rock, so named, Shall lure no vessel any more to drop Among the breakers. Peter's chair is shamed Like any vulgar throne the nations lop To pieces for their firewood unreclaimed,— And, when it burns too, we shall see as well In Italy as elsewhere. Let it burn. The cross, accounted still adorable, Is Christ's cross only!—if the thief's would earn Some stealthy genuflexions, we rebel; And here the impenitent thief's has had its turn, As God knows; and the people on their knees Scoff and toss back the crosiers stretched like yokes To press their heads down lower by degrees. So Italy, by means of these last strokes, Escapes the danger which preceded these, Of leaving captured hands in cloven oaks,— Of leaving very souls within the buckle Whence bodies struggled outward,—of supposing That freemen may like bondsmen kneel and truckle, And then stand up as usual, without losing An inch of stature. Those whom she-wolves suckle Will bite as wolves do in the grapple-closing Of adverse interests. This at last is known (Thank Pius for the lesson), that albeit Among the popedom's hundred heads of stone Which blink down on you from the roof's retreat In Siena's tiger-striped cathedral, Joan And Borgia 'mid their fellows you may greet, A harlot and a devil,—you will see Not a man, still less angel, grandly set With open soul to render man more free. The fishers are still thinking of the net, And, if not thinking of the hook too, we Are counted somewhat deeply in their debt; But that's a rare case—so, by hook and crook They take the advantage, agonising Christ By rustier nails than those of Cedron's brook, I' the people's body very cheaply priced,— And quote high priesthood out of Holy book, While buying death-fields with the sacrificed. Priests, priests,—there's no such name!—God's own, except Ye take most vainly. Through heaven's lifted gate The priestly ephod in sole glory swept When Christ ascended, entered in, and sate (With victor face sublimely overwept) At Deity's right hand, to mediate, He alone, He for ever. On His breast The Urim and the Thummim, fed with fire From the full Godhead, flicker with the unrest Of human pitiful heart-beats. Come up higher, All Christians! Levi's tribe is dispossest. That solitary alb ye shall admire, But not cast lots for. The last chrism, poured right, Was on that Head, and poured for burial And not for domination in men's sight. What are these churches? The old temple-wall Doth overlook them juggling with the sleight Of surplice, candlestick and altar-pall; East church and west church, ay, north church and south, Rome's church and England's,—let them all repent, And make concordats 'twixt their soul and mouth, Succeed Saint Paul by working at the tent, Become infallible guides by speaking truth, And excommunicate their pride that bent And cramped the souls of men. Why, even here Priestcraft burns out, the twinèd linen blazes; Not, like asbestos, to grow white and clear, But all to perish!—while the fire-smell raises To life some swooning spirits who, last year, Lost breath and heart in these church-stifled places. Why, almost through this Pius, we believed The priesthood could be an honest thing, he smiled So saintly while our corn was being sheaved For his own granaries! Showing now defiled His hireling hands, a better help's achieved Than if they blessed us shepherd-like and mild. False doctrine, strangled by its own amen, Dies in the throat of all this nation. Who Will speak a pope's name as they rise again? What woman or what child will count him true? What dreamer praise him with the voice or pen? What man fight for him?—Pius takes his due. Record that gain, Mazzini!—Yes, but first Set down thy people's faults; set down the want Of soul-conviction; set down aims dispersed, And incoherent means, and valour scant Because of scanty faith, and schisms accursed That wrench these brother-hearts from covenant With freedom and each other. Set down this, And this, and see to overcome it when The seasons bring the fruits thou wilt not miss If wary. Let no cry of patriot men Distract thee from the stern analysis Of masses who cry only! keep thy ken Clear as thy soul is virtuous. Heroes' blood Splashed up against thy noble brow in Rome; Let such not blind thee to an interlude Which was not also holy, yet did come 'Twixt sacramental actions,—brotherhood Despised even there, and something of the doom Of Remus in the trenches. Listen now— Rossi died silent near where Cæsar died. He did not say “My Brutus, is it thou?” But Italy unquestioned testified “I killed him! I am Brutus.—I avow.” At which the whole world's laugh of scorn replied “A poor maimed copy of Brutus!” Too much like, Indeed, to be so unlike! too unskilled At Philippi and the honest battle-pike, To be so skilful where a man is killed Near Pompey's statue, and the daggers strike At unawares i' the throat. Was thus fulfilled An omen once of Michel Angelo?— When Marcus Brutus he conceived complete, And strove to hurl him out by blow on blow Upon the marble, at Art's thunderheat, Till haply (some pre-shadow rising slow Of what his Italy would fancy meet To be called Brutus) straight his plastic hand Fell back before his prophet-soul, and left A fragment, a maimed Brutus,—but more grand Than this, so named at Rome, was! Let thy weft Present one woof and warp, Mazzini! Stand With no man hankering for a dagger's heft, No, not for Italy!—nor stand apart, No, not for the Republic!—from those pure Brave men who hold the level of thy heart In patriot truth, as lover and as doer, Albeit they will not follow where thou art As extreme theorist. Trust and distrust fewer; And so bind strong and keep unstained the cause Which (God's sign granted) war-trumps newly blown Shall yet annunciate to the world's applause. But now, the world is busy; it has grown A Fair-going world. Imperial England draws The flowing ends of the earth from Fez, Canton, Delhi and Stockholm, Athens and Madrid, The Russias and the vast Americas, As if a queen drew in her robes amid Her golden cincture,—isles, peninsulas, Capes, continents, far inland countries hid By jasper-sands and hills of chrysopras, All trailing in their splendours through the door Of the gorgeous Crystal Palace. Every nation, To every other nation strange of yore, Gives face to face the civic salutation, And holds up in a proud right hand before That congress the best work which she can fashion By her best means. “These corals, will you please To match against your oaks? They grow as fast Within my wilderness of purple seas.”— “This diamond stared upon me as I passed (As a live god's eye from a marble frieze) Along a dark of diamonds. Is it classed?”— “I wove these stuffs so subtly that the gold Swims to the surface of the silk like cream And curdles to fair patterns. Ye behold!”— “These delicatest muslins rather seem Than be, you think? Nay, touch them and be bold, Though such veiled Chakhi's face in Hafiz' dream.”— “These carpets—you walk slow on them like kings, Inaudible like spirits, while your foot Dips deep in velvet roses and such things.”— “Even Apollonius might commend this flute: Philostratus relates of Apollonius how he objected to the musical instrument of Linus the Rhodian that it could not enrich or beautify. The history of music in our day would satisfy the philosopher on one point at least. The music, winding through the stops, upsprings To make the player very rich: compute!” “Here's goblet-glass, to take in with your wine The very sun its grapes were ripened under: Drink light and juice together, and each fine.”— “This model of a steamship moves your wonder? You should behold it crushing down the brine Like a blind Jove who feels his way with thunder.”— “Here's sculpture! Ah, we live too! why not throw Our life into our marbles? Art has place For other artists after Angelo.”— “I tried to paint out here a natural face; For nature includes Raffael, as we know, Not Raffael nature. Will it help my case?”— “Methinks you will not match this steel of ours!”— “Nor you this porcelain! One might dream the clay Retained in it the larvæ of the flowers, They bud so, round the cup, the old Springway.”— “Nor you these carven woods, where birds in bowers With twisting snakes and climbing cupids, play.” O Magi of the east and of the west, Your incense, gold and myrrh are excellent!— What gifts for Christ, then, bring ye with the rest? Your hands have worked well: is your courage spent In handwork only? Have you nothing best, Which generous souls may perfect and present, And He shall thank the givers for? no light Of teaching, liberal nations, for the poor Who sit in darkness when it is not night? No cure for wicked children? Christ,—no cure! No help for women sobbing out of sight Because men made the laws? no brothel-lure Burnt out by popular lightnings? Hast thou found No remedy, my England, for such woes? No outlet, Austria, for the scourged and bound, No entrance for the exiled? no repose, Russia, for knouted Poles worked underground, And gentle ladies bleached among the snows? No mercy for the slave, America? No hope for Rome, free France, chivalric France? Alas, great nations have great shames, I say. No pity, O world, no tender utterance Of benediction, and prayers stretched this way For poor Italia, baffled by mischance? O gracious nations, give some ear to me! You all go to your Fair, and I am one Who at the roadside of humanity Beseech your alms,—God's justice to be done. So, prosper! In the name of Italy, Meantime, her patriot Dead have benison. They only have done well; and, what they did Being perfect, it shall triumph. Let them slumber: No king of Egypt in a pyramid Is safer from oblivion, though he number Full seventy cerements for a coverlid. These Dead be seeds of life, and shall encumber The sad heart of the land until it loose The clammy clods and let out the Spring-growth In beatific green through every bruise. The tyrant should take heed to what he doth, Since every victim-carrion turns to use, And drives a chariot, like a god made wroth, Against each piled injustice. Ay, the least, Dead for Italia, not in vain has died; Though many vainly, ere life's struggle ceased, To mad dissimilar ends have swerved aside; Each grave her nationality has pieced By its own majestic breadth, and fortified And pinned it deeper to the soil. Forlorn Of thanks be, therefore, no one of these graves! Not Hers,—who, at her husband's side, in scorn, Outfaced the whistling shot and hissing waves, Until she felt her little babe unborn Recoil, within her, from the violent staves And bloodhounds of the world,—at which, her life Dropt inwards from her eyes and followed it Beyond the hunters. Garibaldi's wife And child died so. And now, the seaweeds fit Her body, like a proper shroud and coif, And murmurously the ebbing waters grit The little pebbles while she lies interred In the sea-sand. Perhaps, ere dying thus, She looked up in his face (which never stirred From its clenched anguish) as to make excuse For leaving him for his, if so she erred. He well remembers that she could not choose. A memorable grave! Another is At Genoa. There, a king may fitly lie, Who, bursting that heroic heart of his At lost Novara, that he could not die (Though thrice into the cannon's eyes for this He plunged his shuddering steed, and felt the sky Reel back between the fire-shocks), stripped away The ancestral ermine ere the smoke had cleared, And, naked to the soul, that none might say His kingship covered what was base and bleared With treason, went out straight an exile, yea, An exiled patriot. Let him be revered. Yea, verily, Charles Albert has died well; And if he lived not all so, as one spoke, The sin pass softly with the passing-bell: For he was shriven, I think, in cannon-smoke, And, taking off his crown, made visible A hero's forehead. Shaking Austria's yoke He shattered his own hand and heart. “So best,” His last words were upon his lonely bed, “I do not end like popes and dukes at least— Thank God for it.” And now that he is dead, Admitting it is proved and manifest That he was worthy, with a discrowned head, To measure heights with patriots, let them stand Beside the man in his Oporto shroud, And each vouchsafe to take him by the hand, And kiss him on the cheek, and say aloud,— “Thou, too, hast suffered for our native land! My brother, thou art one of us! be proud.” Still, graves, when Italy is talked upon. Still, still, the patriot's tomb, the stranger's hate. Still Niobe! still fainting in the sun, By whose most dazzling arrows violate Her beauteous offspring perished! has she won Nothing but garlands for the graves, from Fate? Nothing but death-songs?—Yes, be it understood Life throbs in noble Piedmont! while the feet Of Rome's clay image, dabbled soft in blood, Grow flat with dissolution and, as meet, Will soon be shovelled off like other mud, To leave the passage free in church and street. And I, who first took hope up in this song, Because a child was singing one . . . behold, The hope and omen were not, haply, wrong! Poets are soothsayers still, like those of old Who studied flights of doves; and creatures young And tender, mighty meanings may unfold. The sun strikes, through the windows, up the floor; Stand out in it, my own young Florentine, Not two years old, and let me see thee more! It grows along thy amber curls, to shine Brighter than elsewhere. Now, look straight before, And fix thy brave blue English eyes on mine, And from my soul, which fronts the future so, With unabashed and unabated gaze, Teach me to hope for, what the angels know When they smile clear as thou dost. Down God's ways With just alighted feet, between the snow And snowdrops, where a little lamb may graze, Thou hast no fear, my lamb, about the road, Albeit in our vainglory we assume That, less than we have, thou hast learnt of God. Stand out, my blue-eyed prophet!—thou, to whom The earliest world-day light that ever flowed, Through Casa Guidi Windows chanced to come! Now shake the glittering nimbus of thy hair, And be God's witness that the elemental New springs of life are gushing everywhere To cleanse the watercourses, and prevent all Concrete obstructions which infest the air! That earth's alive, and gentle or ungentle Motions within her, signify but growth!— The ground swells greenest o'er the labouring moles. Howe'er the uneasy world is vexed and wroth, Young children, lifted high on parent souls, Look round them with a smile upon the mouth, And take for music every bell that tolls; (Who said we should be better if like these?) But we sit murmuring for the future though Posterity is smiling on our knees, Convicting us of folly. Let us go— We will trust God. The blank interstices Men take for ruins, He will build into With pillared marbles rare, or knit across With generous arches, till the fane's complete. This world has no perdition, if some loss. Such cheer I gather from thy smiling, Sweet! The self-same cherub-faces which emboss The Vail, lean inward to the Mercy-seat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AURORA LEIGH. A POEM IN NINE BOOKS. 1856. DEDICATION TO JOHN KENYON, Esq. FIRST BOOK. Of writing many books there is no end; And I who have written much in prose and verse For others' uses, will write now for mine,— Will write my story for my better self, As when you paint your portrait for a friend, Who keeps it in a drawer and looks at it Long after he has ceased to love you, just To hold together what he was and is. I, writing thus, am still what men call young; I have not so far left the coasts of life To travel inland, that I cannot hear That murmur of the outer Infinite Which unweaned babies smile at in their sleep When wondered at for smiling; not so far, But still I catch my mother at her post Beside the nursery door, with finger up, “Hush, hush—here's too much noise!” while her sweet eyes Leap forward, taking part against her word In the child's riot. Still I sit and feel My father's slow hand, when she had left us both, Stroke out my childish curls across his knee, And hear Assunta's daily jest (she knew He liked it better than a better jest) Inquire how many golden scudi went To make such ringlets. O my father's hand, Stroke heavily, heavily the poor hair down, Draw, press the child's head closer to thy knee! I'm still too young, too young, to sit alone. I write. My mother was a Florentine, Whose rare blue eyes were shut from seeing me When scarcely I was four years old, my life A poor spark snatched up from a failing lamp Which went out therefore. She was weak and frail; She could not bear the joy of giving life, The mother's rapture slew her. If her kiss Had left a longer weight upon my lips It might have steadied the uneasy breath, And reconciled and fraternised my soul With the new order. As it was, indeed, I felt a mother-want about the world, And still went seeking, like a bleating lamb Left out at night in shutting up the fold,— As restless as a nest-deserted bird Grown chill through something being away, though what It knows not. I, Aurora Leigh, was born To make my father sadder, and myself Not overjoyous, truly. Women know The way to rear up children (to be just), They know a simple, merry, tender knack Of tying sashes, fitting baby-shoes, And stringing pretty words that make no sense, And kissing full sense into empty words, Which things are corals to cut life upon, Although such trifles: children learn by such, Love's holy earnest in a pretty play And get not over-early solemnised, But seeing, as in a rose-bush, Love's Divine Which burns and hurts not,—not a single bloom,— Become aware and unafraid of Love. Such good do mothers. Fathers love as well —Mine did, I know,—but still with heavier brains, And wills more consciously responsible, And not as wisely, since less foolishly; So mothers have God's license to be missed. My father was an austere Englishman, Who, after a dry lifetime spent at home In college-learning, law, and parish talk, Was flooded with a passion unaware, His whole provisioned and complacent past Drowned out from him that moment. As he stood In Florence, where he had come to spend a month And note the secret of Da Vinci's drains, He musing somewhat absently perhaps Some English question . . . whether men should pay The unpopular but necessary tax With left or right hand—in the alien sun In that great square of the Santissima There drifted past him (scarcely marked enough To move his comfortable island scorn) A train of priestly banners, cross and psalm, The white-veiled rose-crowned maidens holding up Tall tapers, weighty for such wrists, aslant To the blue luminous tremor of the air, And letting drop the white wax as they went To eat the bishop's wafer at the church; From which long trail of chanting priests and girls, A face flashed like a cymbal on his face And shook with silent clangour brain and heart, Transfiguring him to music. Thus, even thus, He too received his sacramental gift With eucharistic meanings; for he loved. And thus beloved, she died. I've heard it said That but to see him in the first surprise Of widower and father, nursing me, Unmothered little child of four years old, His large man's hands afraid to touch my curls, As if the gold would tarnish,—his grave lips Contriving such a miserable smile As if he knew needs must, or I should die, And yet 'twas hard,—would almost make the stones Cry out for pity. There's a verse he set In Santa Croce to her memory,— “Weep for an infant too young to weep much When death removed this mother”—stops the mirth To-day on women's faces when they walk With rosy children hanging on their gowns, Under the cloister to escape the sun That scorches in the piazza. After which He left our Florence and made haste to hide Himself, his prattling child, and silent grief, Among the mountains above Pelago; Because unmothered babes, he thought, had need Of mother nature more than others use, And Pan's white goats, with udders warm and full Of mystic contemplations, come to feed Poor milkless lips of orphans like his own— Such scholar-scraps he talked, I've heard from friends, For even prosaic men who wear grief long Will get to wear it as a hat aside With a flower stuck in't. Father, then, and child, We lived among the mountains many years, God's silence on the outside of the house, And we who did not speak too loud within, And old Assunta to make up the fire, Crossing herself whene'er a sudden flame Which lightened from the firewood, made alive That picture of my mother on the wall. The painter drew it after she was dead, And when the face was finished, throat and hands, Her cameriera carried him, in hate Of the English-fashioned shroud, the last brocade She dressed in at the Pitti; “he should paint No sadder thing than that,” she swore, “to wrong Her poor signora.” Therefore very strange The effect was. I, a little child, would crouch For hours upon the floor with knees drawn up, And gaze across them, half in terror, half In adoration, at the picture there,— That swan-like supernatural white life Just sailing upward from the red stiff silk Which seemed to have no part in it nor power To keep it from quite breaking out of bounds. For hours I sat and stared. Assunta's awe And my poor father's melancholy eyes Still pointed that way. That way went my thoughts When wandering beyond sight. And as I grew In years, I mixed, confused, unconsciously, Whatever I last read or heard or dreamed, Abhorrent, admirable, beautiful, Pathetical, or ghastly, or grotesque, With still that face . . . which did not therefore change, But kept the mystic level of all forms, Hates, fears, and admirations, was by turns Ghost, fiend, and angel, fairy, witch, and sprite, A dauntless Muse who eyes a dreadful Fate, A loving Psyche who loses sight of Love, A still Medusa with mild milky brows All curdled and all clothed upon with snakes Whose slime falls fast as sweat will; or anon Our Lady of the Passion, stabbed with swords Where the Babe sucked; or Lamia in her first Moonlighted pallor, ere she shrunk and blinked And shuddering wriggled down to the unclean; Or my own mother, leaving her last smile In her last kiss upon the baby-mouth My father pushed down on the bed for that,— Or my dead mother, without smile or kiss, Buried at Florence. All which images, Concentred on the picture, glassed themselves Before my meditative childhood, as The incoherencies of change and death Are represented fully, mixed and merged, In the smooth fair mystery of perpetual Life. And while I stared away my childish wits Upon my mother's picture (ah, poor child!), My father, who through love had suddenly Thrown off the old conventions, broken loose From chin-bands of the soul, like Lazarus, Yet had no time to learn to talk and walk Or grow anew familiar with the sun,— Who had reached to freedom, not to action, lived, But lived as one entranced, with thoughts, not aims,— Whom love had unmade from a common man But not completed to an uncommon man,— My father taught me what he had learnt the best Before he died and left me,—grief and love. And, seeing we had books among the hills, Strong words of counselling souls confederate With vocal pines and waters,—out of books He taught me all the ignorance of men, And how God laughs in heaven when any man Says “Here I'm learned; this, I understand; In that, I am never caught at fault or doubt.” He sent the schools to school, demonstrating A fool will pass for such through one mistake, While a philosopher will pass for such, Through said mistakes being ventured in the gross And heaped up to a system. I am like, They tell me, my dear father. Broader brows Howbeit, upon a slenderer undergrowth Of delicate features,—paler, near as grave; But then my mother's smile breaks up the whole, And makes it better sometimes than itself. So, nine full years, our days were hid with God Among his mountains: I was just thirteen, Still growing like the plants from unseen roots In tongue-tied Springs,—and suddenly awoke To full life and life's needs and agonies With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death, Makes awful lightning. His last word was “Love—” “Love, my child, love, love!”—(then he had done with grief) “Love, my child.” Ere I answered he was gone, And none was left to love in all the world. There, ended childhood. What succeeded next I recollect as, after fevers, men Thread back the passage of delirium, Missing the turn still, baffled by the door; Smooth endless days, notched here and there with knives, A weary, wormy darkness, spurred i' the flank With flame, that it should eat and end itself Like some tormented scorpion. Then at last I do remember clearly how there came A stranger with authority, not right (I thought not), who commanded, caught me up From old Assunta's neck; how, with a shriek, She let me go,—while I, with ears too full Of my father's silence to shriek back a word, In all a child's astonishment at grief Stared at the wharf-edge where she stood and moaned, My poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned! The white walls, the blue hills, my Italy, Drawn backward from the shuddering steamer-deck, Like one in anger drawing back her skirts Which suppliants catch at. Then the bitter sea Inexorably pushed between us both And, sweeping up the ship with my despair, Threw us out as a pasture to the stars. Ten nights and days we voyaged on the deep; Ten nights and days without the common face Of any day or night; the moon and sun Cut off from the green reconciling earth, To starve into a blind ferocity And glare unnatural; the very sky (Dropping its bell-net down upon the sea, As if no human heart should 'scape alive) Bedraggled with the desolating salt, Until it seemed no more that holy heaven To which my father went. All new and strange; The universe turned stranger, for a child. Then, land!—then, England! oh, the frosty cliffs Looked cold upon me. Could I find a home Among those mean red houses through the fog? And when I heard my father's language first From alien lips which had no kiss for mine I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept, And some one near me said the child was mad Through much sea-sickness. The train swept us on: Was this my father's England? the great isle? The ground seemed cut up from the fellowship Of verdure, field from field, as man from man; The skies themselves looked low and positive, As almost you could touch them with a hand, And dared to do it they were so far off From God's celestial crystals; all things blurred And dull and vague. Did Shakespeare and his mates Absorb the light here?—not a hill or stone With heart to strike a radiant colour up Or active outline on the indifferent air. I think I see my father's sister stand Upon the hall-step of her country-house To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm, Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight As if for taming accidental thoughts From possible pulses; brown hair pricked with gray By frigid use of life (she was not old, Although my father's elder by a year), A nose drawn sharply, yet in delicate lines; A close mild mouth, a little soured about The ends, through speaking unrequited loves Or peradventure niggardly half-truths; Eyes of no colour,—once they might have smiled, But never, never have forgot themselves In smiling; cheeks, in which was yet a rose Of perished summers, like a rose in a book, Kept more for ruth than pleasure,—if past bloom, Past fading also. She had lived, we'll say, A harmless life, she called a virtuous life, A quiet life, which was not life at all (But that, she had not lived enough to know), Between the vicar and the county squires, The lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes From the empyrean to assure their souls Against chance vulgarisms, and, in the abyss, The apothecary, looked on once a year To prove their soundness of humility. The poor-club exercised her Christian gifts Of knitting stockings, stitching petticoats, Because we are of one flesh, after all, And need one flannel (with a proper sense Of difference in the quality)—and still The book-club, guarded from your modern trick Of shaking dangerous questions from the crease, Preserved her intellectual. She had lived A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage, Accounting that to leap from perch to perch Was act and joy enough for any bird. Dear heaven, how silly are the things that live In thickets, and eat berries! I, alas, A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage, And she was there to meet me. Very kind. Bring the clean water, give out the fresh seed. She stood upon the steps to welcome me, Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck,— Young babes, who catch at every shred of wool To draw the new light closer, catch and cling Less blindly. In my ears my father's word Hummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells, “Love, love, my child.” She, black there with my grief, Might feel my love—she was his sister once— I clung to her. A moment she seemed moved, Kissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling, And drew me feebly through the hall into The room she sat in. There, with some strange spasm Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands Imperiously, and held me at arm's length, And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes Searched through my face,—ay, stabbed it through and through, Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find A wicked murderer in my innocent face, If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath, She struggled for her ordinary calm— And missed it rather,—told me not to shrink, As if she had told me not to lie or swear,— “She loved my father and would love me too As long as I deserved it.” Very kind. I understood her meaning afterward; She thought to find my mother in my face, And questioned it for that. For she, my aunt, Had loved my father truly, as she could, And hated, with the gall of gentle souls, My Tuscan mother who had fooled away A wise man from wise courses, a good man From obvious duties, and, depriving her, His sister, of the household precedence, Had wronged his tenants, robbed his native land, And made him mad, alike by life and death, In love and sorrow. She had pored for years What sort of woman could be suitable To her sort of hate, to entertain it with, And so, her very curiosity Became hate too, and all the idealism She ever used in life was used for hate, Till hate, so nourished, did exceed at last The love from which it grew, in strength and heat, And wrinkled her smooth conscience with a sense Of disputable virtue (say not, sin) When Christian doctrine was enforced at church. And thus my father's sister was to me My mother's hater. From that day she did Her duty to me (I appreciate it In her own word as spoken to herself), Her duty, in large measure, well pressed out, But measured always. She was generous, bland, More courteous than was tender, gave me still The first place,—as if fearful that God's saints Would look down suddenly and say “Herein You missed a point, I think, through lack of love.” Alas, a mother never is afraid Of speaking angerly to any child, Since love, she knows, is justified of love. And I, I was a good child on the whole, A meek and manageable child. Why not? I did not live, to have the faults of life: There seemed more true life in my father's grave Than in all England. Since that threw me off Who fain would cleave (his latest will, they say, Consigned me to his land), I only thought Of lying quiet there where I was thrown Like sea-weed on the rocks, and suffering her To prick me to a pattern with her pin, Fibre from fibre, delicate leaf from leaf, And dry out from my drowned anatomy The last sea-salt left in me. So it was. I broke the copious curls upon my head In braids, because she liked smooth-ordered hair. I left off saying my sweet Tuscan words Which still at any stirring of the heart Came up to float across the English phrase As lilies (Bene or Che che), because She liked my father's child to speak his tongue. I learnt the collects and the catechism, The creeds, from Athanasius back to Nice, The Articles, the Tracts against the times (By no means Buonaventure's “Prick of Love”), And various popular synopses of Inhuman doctrines never taught by John, Because she liked instructed piety. I learnt my complement of classic French (Kept pure of Balzac and neologism) And German also, since she liked a range Of liberal education,—tongues, not books. I learnt a little algebra, a little Of the mathematics,—brushed with extreme flounce The circle of the sciences, because She misliked women who are frivolous. I learnt the royal genealogies Of Oviedo, the internal laws Of the Burmese empire,—by how many feet Mount Chimborazo outsoars Teneriffe, What navigable river joins itself To Lara, and what census of the year five Was taken at Klagenfurt,—because she liked A general insight into useful facts. I learnt much music,—such as would have been As quite impossible in Johnson's day As still it might be wished—fine sleights of hand And unimagined fingering, shuffling off The hearer's soul through hurricanes of notes To a noisy Tophet; and I drew . . . costumes From French engravings, nereids neatly draped (With smirks of simmering godship): I washed in Landscapes from nature (rather say, washed out). I danced the polka and Cellarius, Spun glass, stuffed birds, and modelled flowers in wax, Because she liked accomplishments in girls. I read a score of books on womanhood To prove, if women do not think at all, They may teach thinking (to a maiden aunt Or else the author),—books that boldly assert Their right of comprehending husband's talk When not too deep, and even of answering With pretty “may it please you,” or “so it is,”— Their rapid insight and fine aptitude, Particular worth and general missionariness, As long as they keep quiet by the fire And never say “no” when the world says “ay,” For that is fatal,—their angelic reach Of virtue, chiefly used to sit and darn, And fatten household sinners,—their, in brief, Potential faculty in everything Of abdicating power in it: she owned She liked a woman to be womanly, And English women, she thanked God and sighed (Some people always sigh in thanking God), Were models to the universe. And last I learnt cross-stitch, because she did not like To see me wear the night with empty hands A-doing nothing. So, my shepherdess Was something after all (the pastoral saints Be praised for't), leaning lovelorn with pink eyes To match her shoes, when I mistook the silks; Her head uncrushed by that round weight of hat So strangely similar to the tortoise-shell Which slew the tragic poet. By the way, The works of women are symbolical. We sew, sew, prick our fingers, dull our sight, Producing what? A pair of slippers, sir, To put on when you're weary—or a stool To stumble over and vex you . . . “curse that stool!” Or else at best, a cushion, where you lean And sleep, and dream of something we are not But would be for your sake. Alas, alas! This hurts most, this—that, after all, we are paid The worth of our work, perhaps. In looking down Those years of education (to return) I wonder if Brinvilliers suffered more In the water-torture . . . flood succeeding flood To drench the incapable throat and split the veins . . . Than I did. Certain of your feebler souls Go out in such a process; many pine To a sick, inodorous light; my own endured: I had relations in the Unseen, and drew The elemental nutriment and heat From nature, as earth feels the sun at nights, Or as a babe sucks surely in the dark. I kept the life thrust on me, on the outside Of the inner life with all its ample room For heart and lungs, for will and intellect, Inviolable by conventions. God, I thank thee for that grace of thine! At first I felt no life which was not patience,—did The thing she bade me, without heed to a thing Beyond it, sat in just the chair she placed, With back against the window, to exclude The sight of the great lime-tree on the lawn, Which seemed to have come on purpose from the woods To bring the house a message,—ay, and walked Demurely in her carpeted low rooms, As if I should not, hearkening my own steps, Misdoubt I was alive. I read her books, Was civil to her cousin, Romney Leigh, Gave ear to her vicar, tea to her visitors, And heard them whisper, when I changed a cup (I blushed for joy at that),—“The Italian child, For all her blue eyes and her quiet ways, Thrives ill in England: she is paler yet Than when we came the last time; she will die.” “Will die.” My cousin, Romney Leigh, blushed too, With sudden anger, and approaching me Said low between his teeth, “You're wicked now? You wish to die and leave the world a-dusk For others, with your naughty light blown out?” I looked into his face defyingly; He might have known that, being what I was, 'Twas natural to like to get away As far as dead folk can: and then indeed Some people make no trouble when they die. He turned and went abruptly, slammed the door, And shut his dog out. Romney, Romney Leigh. I have not named my cousin hitherto, And yet I used him as a sort of friend; My elder by few years, but cold and shy And absent . . . tender, when he thought of it, Which scarcely was imperative, grave betimes, As well as early master of Leigh Hall, Whereof the nightmare sat upon his youth, Repressing all its seasonable delights, And agonising with a ghastly sense Of universal hideous want and wrong To incriminate possession. When he came From college to the country, very oft He crossed the hill on visits to my aunt, With gifts of blue grapes from the hothouses, A book in one hand,—mere statistics (if I chanced to lift the cover), count of all The goats whose beards grow sprouting down toward hell Against God's separative judgment-hour. And she, she almost loved him,—even allowed That sometimes he should seem to sigh my way; It made him easier to be pitiful, And sighing was his gift. So, undisturbed, At whiles she let him shut my music up And push my needles down, and lead me out To see in that south angle of the house The figs grow black as if by a Tuscan rock, On some light pretext. She would turn her head At other moments, go to fetch a thing, And leave me breath enough to speak with him, For his sake; it was simple. Sometimes too He would have saved me utterly, it seemed, He stood and looked so. Once, he stood so near, He dropped a sudden hand upon my head Bent down on woman's work, as soft as rain— But then I rose and shook it off as fire, The stranger's touch that took my father's place Yet dared seem soft. I used him for a friend Before I ever knew him for a friend. 'Twas better, 'twas worse also, afterward: We came so close, we saw our differences Too intimately. Always Romney Leigh Was looking for the worms, I for the gods. A godlike nature his; the gods look down, Incurious of themselves; and certainly 'Tis well I should remember, how, those days, I was a worm too, and he looked on me. A little by his act perhaps, yet more By something in me, surely not my will, I did not die. But slowly, as one in swoon, To whom life creeps back in the form of death, With a sense of separation, a blind pain Of blank obstruction, and a roar i' the ears Of visionary chariots which retreat As earth grows clearer . . . slowly, by degrees, I woke, rose up . . . where was I? in the world; For uses therefore I must count worth while. I had a little chamber in the house, As green as any privet-hedge a bird Might choose to build in, though the nest itself Could show but dead-brown sticks and straws; the walls Were green, the carpet was pure green, the straight Small bed was curtained greenly, and the folds Hung green about the window which let in The out-door world with all its greenery. You could not push your head out and escape A dash of dawn-dew from the honeysuckle, But so you were baptized into the grace And privilege of seeing. . . . First, the lime (I had enough there, of the lime, be sure,— My morning-dream was often hummed away By the bees in it); past the lime, the lawn, Which, after sweeping broadly round the house, Went trickling through the shrubberies in a stream Of tender turf, and wore and lost itself Among the acacias, over which you saw The irregular line of elms by the deep lane Which stopped the grounds and dammed the overflow Of arbutus and laurel. Out of sight The lane was; sunk so deep, no foreign tramp Nor drover of wild ponies out of Wales Could guess if lady's hall or tenant's lodge Dispensed such odours,—though his stick well-crooked Might reach the lowest trail of blossoming briar Which dipped upon the wall. Behind the elms, And through their tops, you saw the folded hills Striped up and down with hedges (burly oaks Projecting from the line to show themselves), Through which my cousin Romney's chimneys smoked As still as when a silent mouth in frost Breathes, showing where the woodlands hid Leigh Hall; While, far above, a jut of table-land, A promontory without water, stretched,— You could not catch it if the days were thick, Or took it for a cloud; but, otherwise, The vigorous sun would catch it up at eve And use it for an anvil till he had filled The shelves of heaven with burning thunderbolts, Protesting against night and darkness:—then, When all his setting trouble was resolved To a trance of passive glory, you might see In apparition on the golden sky (Alas, my Giotto's background!) the sheep run Along the fine clear outline, small as mice That run along a witch's scarlet thread. Not a grand nature. Not my chestnut-woods Of Vallombrosa, cleaving by the spurs To the precipices. Not my headlong leaps Of waters, that cry out for joy or fear In leaping through the palpitating pines, Like a white soul tossed out to eternity With thrills of time upon it. Not indeed My multitudinous mountains, sitting in The magic circle, with the mutual touch Electric, panting from their full deep hearts Beneath the influent heavens, and waiting for Communion and commission. Italy Is one thing, England one. On English ground You understand the letter,—ere the fall How Adam lived in a garden. All the fields Are tied up fast with hedges, nosegay-like; The hills are crumpled plains, the plains parterres, The trees, round, woolly, ready to be clipped, And if you seek for any wilderness You find, at best, a park. A nature tamed And grown domestic like a barn-door fowl, Which does not awe you with its claws and beak, Nor tempt you to an eyrie too high up, But which, in cackling, sets you thinking of Your eggs to-morrow at breakfast, in the pause Of finer meditation. Rather say, A sweet familiar nature, stealing in As a dog might, or child, to touch your hand Or pluck your gown, and humbly mind you so Of presence and affection, excellent For inner uses, from the things without. I could not be unthankful, I who was Entreated thus and holpen. In the room I speak of, ere the house was well awake, And also after it was well asleep, I sat alone, and drew the blessing in Of all that nature. With a gradual step, A stir among the leaves, a breath, a ray, It came in softly, while the angels made A place for it beside me. The moon came, And swept my chamber clean of foolish thoughts. The sun came, saying, “Shall I lift this light Against the lime-tree, and you will not look? I make the birds sing—listen! but, for you, God never hears your voice, excepting when You lie upon the bed at nights and weep.” Then, something moved me. Then, I wakened up More slowly than I verily write now, But wholly, at last, I wakened, opened wide The window and my soul, and let the airs And out-door sights sweep gradual gospels in, Regenerating what I was. O Life, How oft we throw it off and think,—“Enough, Enough of life in so much!—here's a cause For rupture;—herein we must break with Life, Or be ourselves unworthy; here we are wronged, Maimed, spoiled for aspiration: farewell, Life!” And so, as froward babes, we hide our eyes And think all ended.—Then, Life calls to us In some transformed, apocalyptic voice, Above us, or below us, or around: Perhaps we name it Nature's voice, or Love's, Tricking ourselves, because we are more ashamed To own our compensations than our griefs: Still, Life's voice!—still, we make our peace with Life. And I, so young then, was not sullen. Soon I used to get up early, just to sit And watch the morning quicken in the gray, And hear the silence open like a flower Leaf after leaf,—and stroke with listless hand The woodbine through the window, till at last I came to do it with a sort of love, At foolish unaware: whereat I smiled,— A melancholy smile, to catch myself Smiling for joy. Capacity for joy Admits temptation. It seemed, next, worth while To dodge the sharp sword set against my life; To slip down stairs through all the sleepy house, As mute as any dream there, and escape As a soul from the body, out of doors, Glide through the shrubberies, drop into the lane, And wander on the hills an hour or two, Then back again before the house should stir. Or else I sat on in my chamber green, And lived my life, and thought my thoughts, and prayed My prayers without the vicar; read my books, Without considering whether they were fit To do me good. Mark, there. We get no good By being ungenerous, even to a book, And calculating profits,—so much help By so much reading. It is rather when We gloriously forget ourselves and plunge Soul-forward, headlong, into a book's profound, Impassioned for its beauty and salt of truth— 'Tis then we get the right good from a book. I read much. What my father taught before From many a volume, Love re-emphasised Upon the self-same pages: Theophrast Grew tender with the memory of his eyes, And Ælian made mine wet. The trick of Greek And Latin he had taught me, as he would Have taught me wrestling or the game of fives If such he had known,—most like a shipwrecked man Who heaps his single platter with goats' cheese And scarlet berries; or like any man Who loves but one, and so gives all at once, Because he has it, rather than because He counts it worthy. Thus, my father gave; And thus, as did the women formerly By young Achilles, when they pinned a veil Across the boy's audacious front, and swept With tuneful laughs the silver-fretted rocks, He wrapt his little daughter in his large Man's doublet, careless did it fit or no. But, after I had read for memory, I read for hope. The path my father's foot Had trod me out (which suddenly broke off What time he dropped the wallet of the flesh And passed), alone I carried on, and set My child-heart 'gainst the thorny underwood, To reach the grassy shelter of the trees. Ah babe i' the wood, without a brother-babe! My own self-pity, like the red-breast bird, Flies back to cover all that past with leaves. Sublimest danger, over which none weeps, When any young wayfaring soul goes forth Alone, unconscious of the perilous road, The day-sun dazzling in his limpid eyes, To thrust his own way, he an alien, through The world of books! Ah, you!—you think it fine, You clap hands—“A fair day!”—you cheer him on, As if the worst, could happen, were to rest Too long beside a fountain. Yet, behold, Behold!—the world of books is still the world, And worldings in it are less merciful And more puissant. For the wicked there Are winged like angels; every knife that strikes Is edged from elemental fire to assail A spiritual life; the beautiful seems right By force of beauty, and the feeble wrong Because of weakness; power is justified Though armed against Saint Michael; many a crown Covers bald foreheads. In the book-world, true, There's no lack, neither, of God's saints and kings, That shake the ashes of the grave aside From their calm locks and undiscomfited Look steadfast truths against Time's changing mask. True, many a prophet teaches in the roads; True, many a seer pulls down the flaming heavens Upon his own head in strong martyrdom In order to light men a moment's space. But stay!—who judges?—who distinguishes 'Twixt Saul and Nahash justly, at first sight, And leaves king Saul precisely at the sin, To serve king David? who discerns at once The sound of the trumpets, when the trumpets blow For Alaric as well as Charlemagne? Who judges wizards, and can tell true seers From conjurers? the child, there? Would you leave That child to wander in a battle-field And push his innocent smile against the guns; Or even in a catacomb,—his torch Grown ragged in the fluttering air, and all The dark a-mutter round him? not a child. I read books bad and good—some bad and good At once (good aims not always make good books: Well-tempered spades turn up ill-smelling soils In digging vineyards even); books that prove God's being so definitely, that man's doubt Grows self-defined the other side the line, Made atheist by suggestion; moral books, Exasperating to license; genial books, Discounting from the human dignity; And merry books, which set you weeping when The sun shines,—ay, and melancholy books, Which make you laugh that any one should weep In this disjointed life for one wrong more. The world of books is still the world, I write, And both worlds have God's providence, thank God, To keep and hearten: with some struggle, indeed, Among the breakers, some hard swimming through The deeps—I lost breath in my soul sometimes And cried “God save me if there's any God,” But, even so, God saved me; and, being dashed From error on to error, every turn Still brought me nearer to the central truth. I thought so. All this anguish in the thick Of men's opinions . . . press and counterpress, Now up, now down, now underfoot, and now Emergent . . . all the best of it, perhaps, But throws you back upon a noble trust And use of your own instinct,—merely proves Pure reason stronger than bare inference At strongest. Try it,—fix against heaven's wall The scaling-ladders of school logic—mount Step by step!—sight goes faster; that still ray Which strikes out from you, how, you cannot tell, And why, you know not (did you eliminate, That such as you indeed should analyse?) Goes straight and fast as light, and high as God. The cygnet finds the water, but the man Is born in ignorance of his element And feels out blind at first, disorganised By sin i' the blood,—his spirit-insight dulled And crossed by his sensations. Presently He feels it quicken in the dark sometimes, When, mark, be reverent, be obedient, For such dumb motions of imperfect life Are oracles of vital Deity Attesting the Hereafter. Let who says “The soul's a clean white paper,” rather say, A palimpsest, a prophet's holograph Defiled, erased and covered by a monk's,— The apocalypse, by a Longus! poring on Which obscene text, we may discern perhaps Some fair, fine trace of what was written once, Some upstroke of an alpha and omega Expressing the old scripture. Books, books, books! I had found the secret of a garret-room Piled high with cases in my father's name, Piled high, packed large,—where, creeping in and out Among the giant fossils of my past, Like some small nimble mouse between the ribs Of a mastodon, I nibbled here and there At this or that box, pulling through the gap, In heats of terror, haste, victorious joy, The first book first. And how I felt it beat Under my pillow, in the morning's dark, An hour before the sun would let me read! My books! At last because the time was ripe, I chanced upon the poets. As the earth Plunges in fury, when the internal fires Have reached and pricked her heart, and, throwing flat The marts and temples, the triumphal gates And towers of observation, clears herself To elemental freedom—thus, my soul, At poetry's divine first finger-touch, Let go conventions and sprang up surprised, Convicted of the great eternities Before two worlds. What's this, Aurora Leigh, You write so of the poets, and not laugh? Those virtuous liars, dreamers after dark, Exaggerators of the sun and moon, And soothsayers in a tea-cup? I write so Of the only truth-tellers now left to God, The only speakers of essential truth, Opposed to relative, comparative, And temporal truths; the only holders by His sun-skirts, through conventional gray glooms; The only teachers who instruct mankind From just a shadow on a charnel-wall To find man's veritable stature out Erect, sublime,—the measure of a man, And that's the measure of an angel, says The apostle. Ay, and while your common men Lay telegraphs, gauge railroads, reign, reap, dine, And dust the flaunty carpets of the world For kings to walk on, or our president, The poet suddenly will catch them up With his voice like a thunder,—“This is soul, This is life, this word is being said in heaven, Here's God down on us! what are you about?” How all those workers start amid their work, Look round, look up, and feel, a moment's space, That carpet-dusting, though a pretty trade, Is not the imperative labour after all. My own best poets, am I one with you, That thus I love you,—or but one through love? Does all this smell of thyme about my feet Conclude my visit to your holy hill In personal presence, or but testify The rustling of your vesture through my dreams With influent odours? When my joy and pain, My thought and aspiration, like the stops Of pipe or flute, are absolutely dumb Unless melodious, do you play on me My pipers,—and if, sooth, you did not blow, Would no sound come? or is the music mine, As a man's voice or breath is called his own, Inbreathed by the Life-breather? There's a doubt For cloudy seasons! But the sun was high When first I felt my pulses set themselves For concord; when the rhythmic turbulence Of blood and brain swept outward upon words, As wind upon the alders, blanching them By turning up their under-natures till They trembled in dilation. O delight And triumph of the poet, who would say A man's mere “yes,” a woman's common “no,” A little human hope of that or this, And says the word so that it burns you through With a special revelation, shakes the heart Of all the men and women in the world, As if one came back from the dead and spoke, With eyes too happy, a familiar thing Become divine i' the utterance! while for him The poet, speaker, he expands with joy; The palpitating angel in his flesh Thrills inly with consenting fellowship To those innumerous spirits who sun themselves Outside of time. O life, O poetry, —Which means life in life! cognisant of life Beyond this blood-beat, passionate for truth Beyond these senses!—poetry, my life, My eagle, with both grappling feet still hot From Zeus's thunder, who hast ravished me Away from all the shepherds, sheep, and dogs, And set me in the Olympian roar and round Of luminous faces for a cup-bearer, To keep the mouths of all the godheads moist For everlasting laughters,—I myself Half drunk across the beaker with their eyes! How those gods look! Enough so, Ganymede, We shall not bear above a round or two. We drop the golden cup at Heré's foot And swoon back to the earth,—and find ourselves Face-down among the pine-cones, cold with dew, While the dogs bark, and many a shepherd scoffs, “What's come now to the youth?” Such ups and downs Have poets. Am I such indeed? The name Is royal, and to sign it like a queen Is what I dare not,—though some royal blood Would seem to tingle in me now and then, With sense of power and ache,—with imposthumes And manias usual to the race. Howbeit I dare not: 'tis too easy to go mad And ape a Bourbon in a crown of straws; The thing's too common. Many fervent souls Strike rhyme on rhyme, who would strike steel on steel If steel had offered, in a restless heat Of doing something. Many tender souls Have strung their losses on a rhyming thread, As children cowslips:—the more pains they take, The work more withers. Young men, ay, and maids, Too often sow their wild oats in tame verse, Before they sit down under their own vine And live for use. Alas, near all the birds Will sing at dawn,—and yet we do not take The chaffering swallow for the holy lark. In those days, though, I never analysed, Not even myself. Analysis comes late. You catch a sight of Nature, earliest, In full front sun-face, and your eyelids wink And drop before the wonder of't; you miss The form, through seeing the light. I lived, those days, And wrote because I lived—unlicensed else; My heart beat in my brain. Life's violent flood Abolished bounds,—and, which my neighbour's field, Which mine, what mattered? it is thus in youth! We play at leap-frog over the god Term; The love within us and the love without Are mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love, We scarce distinguish: thus, with other power; Being acted on and acting seem the same: In that first onrush of life's chariot-wheels, We know not if the forests move or we. And so, like most young poets, in a flush Of individual life I poured myself Along the veins of others, and achieved Mere lifeless imitations of live verse, And made the living answer for the dead, Profaning nature. “Touch not, do not taste, Nor handle,”—we're too legal, who write young: We beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs, As if still ignorant of counterpoint; We call the Muse,—“O Muse, benignant Muse,”— As if we had seen her purple-braided head, With the eyes in it, start between the boughs As often as a stag's. What make-believe, With so much earnest! what effete results From virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odes From such white heats!—bucolics, where the cows Would scare the writer if they splashed the mud In lashing off the flies,—didactics, driven Against the heels of what the master said; And counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps A babe might blow between two straining cheeks Of bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh; And elegiac griefs, and songs of love, Like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road, The worse for being warm: all these things, writ On happy mornings, with a morning heart, That leaps for love, is active for resolve, Weak for art only. Oft, the ancient forms Will thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood. The wine-skins, now and then, a little warped, Will crack even, as the new wine gurgles in. Spare the old bottles!—spill not the new wine. By Keats's soul, the man who never stepped In gradual progress like another man, But, turning grandly on his central self, Ensphered himself in twenty perfect years And died, not young (the life of a long life Distilled to a mere drop, falling like a tear Upon the world's cold cheek to make it burn For ever); by that strong excepted soul, I count it strange and hard to understand That nearly all young poets should write old, That Pope was sexagenary at sixteen, And beardless Byron academical, And so with others. It may be perhaps Such have not settled long and deep enough In trance, to attain to clairvoyance,—and still The memory mixes with the vision, spoils, And works it turbid. Or perhaps, again, In order to discover the Muse-Sphinx, The melancholy desert must sweep round, Behind you as before.— For me, I wrote False poems, like the rest, and thought them true Because myself was true in writing them. I peradventure have writ true ones since With less complacence. But I could not hide My quickening inner life from those at watch. They saw a light at a window, now and then, They had not set there: who had set it there? My father's sister started when she caught My soul agaze in my eyes. She could not say I had no business with a sort of soul, But plainly she objected,—and demurred That souls were dangerous things to carry straight Through all the spilt saltpetre of the world. She said sometimes “Aurora, have you done Your task this morning? have you read that book? And are you ready for the crochet here?”— As if she said “I know there's something wrong; I know I have not ground you down enough To flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust For household uses and proprieties, Before the rain has got into my barn And set the grains a-sprouting. What, you're green With out-door impudence? you almost grow?” To which I answered, “Would she hear my task, And verify my abstract of the book? Or should I sit down to the crochet work? Was such her pleasure?” Then I sat and teased The patient needle till it spilt the thread, Which oozed off from it in meandering lace From hour to hour. I was not, therefore, sad; My soul was singing at a work apart Behind the wall of sense, as safe from harm As sings the lark when sucked up out of sight In vortices of glory and blue air. And so, through forced work and spontaneous work, The inner life informed the outer life, Reduced the irregular blood to a settled rhythm, Made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams, And, rounding to the spheric soul the thin, Pined body, struck a colour up the cheeks Though somewhat faint. I clenched my brows across My blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass, And said “We'll live, Aurora! we'll be strong. The dogs are on us—but we will not die.” Whoever lives true life will love true love. I learnt to love that England. Very oft, Before the day was born, or otherwise Through secret windings of the afternoons, I threw my hunters off and plunged myself Among the deep hills, as a hunted stag Will take the waters, shivering with the fear And passion of the course. And when at last Escaped, so many a green slope built on slope Betwixt me and the enemy's house behind, I dared to rest, or wander, in a rest Made sweeter for the step upon the grass, And view the ground's most gentle dimplement (As if God's finger touched but did not press In making England), such an up and down Of verdure,—nothing too much up or down, A ripple of land; such little hills, the sky Can stoop to tenderly and the wheatfields climb; Such nooks of valleys lined with orchises, Fed full of noises by invisible streams; And open pastures where you scarcely tell White daisies from white dew,—at intervals The mythic oaks and elm-trees standing out Self-poised upon their prodigy of shade,— I thought my father's land was worthy too Of being my Shakespeare's. Very oft alone, Unlicensed; not unfrequently with leave To walk the third with Romney and his friend The rising painter, Vincent Carrington, Whom men judge hardly as bee-bonneted, Because he holds that, paint a body well, You paint a soul by implication, like The grand first Master. Pleasant walks! for if He said “When I was last in Italy,” It sounded as an instrument that's played Too far off for the tune—and yet it's fine To listen. Ofter we walked only two If cousin Romney pleased to walk with me. We read, or talked, or quarrelled, as it chanced. We were not lovers, nor even friends well-matched: Say rather, scholars upon different tracks, And thinkers disagreed: he, overfull Of what is, and I, haply, overbold For what might be. But then the thrushes sang, And shook my pulses and the elms' new leaves: At which I turned, and held my finger up, And bade him mark that, howsoe'er the world Went ill, as he related, certainly The thrushes still sang in it. At the word His brow would soften,—and he bore with me In melancholy patience, not unkind, While breaking into voluble ecstasy I flattered all the beauteous country round, As poets use, the skies, the clouds, the fields, The happy violets hiding from the roads The primroses run down to, carrying gold; The tangled hedgerows, where the cows push out Impatient horns and tolerant churning mouths 'Twixt dripping ash-boughs,—hedgerows all alive With birds and gnats and large white butterflies Which look as if the May-flower had caught life And palpitated forth upon the wind; Hills, vales, woods, netted in a silver mist, Farms, granges, doubled up among the hills; And cattle grazing in the watered vales, And cottage-chimneys smoking from the woods, And cottage-gardens smelling everywhere, Confused with smell of orchards. “See,” I said, “And see! is God not with us on the earth? And shall we put Him down by aught we do? Who says there's nothing for the poor and vile Save poverty and wickedness? behold!” And ankle-deep in English grass I leaped And clapped my hands, and called all very fair. In the beginning when God called all good, Even then was evil near us, it is writ; But we indeed who call things good and fair, The evil is upon us while we speak; Deliver us from evil, let us pray. SECOND BOOK. Times followed one another. Came a morn I stood upon the brink of twenty years, And looked before and after, as I stood Woman and artist,—either incomplete, Both credulous of completion. There I held The whole creation in my little cup, And smiled with thirsty lips before I drank “Good health to you and me, sweet neighbour mine, And all these peoples.” I was glad, that day; The June was in me, with its multitudes Of nightingales all singing in the dark, And rosebuds reddening where the calyx split. I felt so young, so strong, so sure of God! So glad, I could not choose be very wise! And, old at twenty, was inclined to pull My childhood backward in a childish jest To see the face of 't once more, and farewell! In which fantastic mood I bounded forth At early morning,—would not wait so long As even to snatch my bonnet by the strings, But, brushing a green trail across the lawn With my gown in the dew, took will and way Among the acacias of the shrubberies, To fly my fancies in the open air And keep my birthday, till my aunt awoke To stop good dreams. Meanwhile I murmured on As honeyed bees keep humming to themselves, “The worthiest poets have remained uncrowned Till death has bleached their foreheads to the bone; And so with me it must be unless I prove Unworthy of the grand adversity, And certainly I would not fail so much. What, therefore, if I crown myself to-day In sport, not pride, to learn the feel of it, Before my brows be numbed as Dante's own To all the tender pricking of such leaves? Such leaves! what leaves?” I pulled the branches down To choose from. “Not the bay! I choose no bay (The fates deny us if we are overbold), Nor myrtle—which means chiefly love; and love Is something awful which one dares not touch So early o' mornings. This verbena strains The point of passionate fragrance; and hard by, This guelder-rose, at far too slight a beck Of the wind, will toss about her flower-apples. Ah—there's my choice,—that ivy on the wall, That headlong ivy! not a leaf will grow But thinking of a wreath. Large leaves, smooth leaves, Serrated like my vines, and half as green. I like such ivy, bold to leap a height 'Twas strong to climb; as good to grow on graves As twist about a thyrsus; pretty too (And that's not ill) when twisted round a comb.” Thus speaking to myself, half singing it, Because some thoughts are fashioned like a bell To ring with once being touched, I drew a wreath Drenched, blinding me with dew, across my brow, And fastening it behind so, turning faced . . . My public!—cousin Romney—with a mouth Twice graver than his eyes. I stood there fixed,— My arms up, like the caryatid, sole Of some abolished temple, helplessly Persistent in a gesture which derides A former purpose. Yet my blush was flame, As if from flax, not stone. “Aurora Leigh, The earliest of Auroras!” Hand stretched out I clasped, as shipwrecked men will clasp a hand, Indifferent to the sort of palm. The tide Had caught me at my pastime, writing down My foolish name too near upon the sea Which drowned me with a blush as foolish. “You, My cousin!” The smile died out in his eyes And dropped upon his lips, a cold dead weight, For just a moment, “Here's a book I found! No name writ on it—poems, by the form; Some Greek upon the margin,—lady's Greek Without the accents. Read it? Not a word. I saw at once the thing had witchcraft in't, Whereof the reading calls up dangerous spirits: I rather bring it to the witch.” “My book. You found it” . . . “In the hollow by the stream That beech leans down into—of which you said The Oread in it has a Naiad's heart And pines for waters.” “Thank you.” “Thanks to you My cousin! that I have seen you not too much Witch, scholar, poet, dreamer, and the rest, To be a woman also.” With a glance The smile rose in his eyes again and touched The ivy on my forehead, light as air. I answered gravely “Poets needs must be Or men or women—more's the pity.” “Ah, But men, and still less women, happily, Scarce need be poets. Keep to the green wreath, Since even dreaming of the stone and bronze Brings headaches, pretty cousin, and defiles The clean white morning dresses.” “So you judge! Because I love the beautiful I must Love pleasure chiefly, and be overcharged For ease and whiteness! well, you know the world, And only miss your cousin, 'tis not much. But learn this; I would rather take my part With God's Dead, who afford to walk in white Yet spread His glory, than keep quiet here And gather up my feet from even a step For fear to soil my gown in so much dust. I choose to walk at all risks.—Here, if heads That hold a rhythmic thought, much ache perforce, For my part I choose headaches,—and today's My birthday.” “Dear Aurora, choose instead To cure them. You have balsams.” “I perceive. The headache is too noble for my sex. You think the heartache would sound decenter, Since that's the woman's special, proper ache, And altogether tolerable, except To a woman.” Saying which, I loosed my wreath, And swinging it beside me as I walked, Half-petulant, half-playful, as we walked, I sent a sidelong look to find his thought,— As falcon set on falconer's finger may, With sidelong head, and startled, braving eye, Which means, “You'll see—you'll see! I'll soon take flight, You shall not hinder.” He, as shaking out His hand and answering “Fly then,” did not speak, Except by such a gesture. Silently We paced, until, just coming into sight Of the house-windows, he abruptly caught At one end of the swinging wreath, and said “Aurora!” There I stopped short, breath and all. “Aurora, let's be serious, and throw by This game of head and heart. Life means, be sure, Both heart and head,—both active, both complete, And both in earnest. Men and women make The world, as head and heart make human life. Work man, work woman, since there's work to do In this beleaguered earth, for head and heart, And thought can never do the work of love: But work for ends, I mean for uses, not For such sleek fringes (do you call them ends, Still less God's glory?) as we sew ourselves Upon the velvet of those baldaquins Held 'twixt us and the sun. That book of yours, I have not read a page of; but I toss A rose up—it falls calyx down, you see! The chances are that, being a woman, young And pure, with such a pair of large, calm eyes, You write as well . . . and ill . . . upon the whole, As other women. If as well, what then? If even a little better, . . . still, what then? We want the Best in art now, or no art. The time is done for facile settings up Of minnow gods, nymphs here and tritons there; The polytheists have gone out in God, That unity of Bests. No best, no God! And so with art, we say. Give art's divine, Direct, indubitable, real as grief, Or leave us to the grief we grow ourselves Divine by overcoming with mere hope And most prosaic patience. You, you are young As Eve with nature's daybreak on her face, But this same world you are come to, dearest coz, Has done with keeping birthdays, saves her wreaths To hang upon her ruins,—and forgets To rhyme the cry with which she still beats back Those savage, hungry dogs that hunt her down To the empty grave of Christ. The world's hard pressed: The sweat of labour in the early curse Has (turning acrid in six thousand years) Become the sweat of torture. Who has time, An hour's time . . . think!—to sit upon a bank And hear the cymbal tinkle in white hands? When Egypt's slain, I say, let Miriam sing!— Before—where's Moses?” “Ah, exactly that. Where's Moses?—is a Moses to be found? You'll seek him vainly in the bulrushes, While I in vain touch cymbals. Yet concede, Such sounding brass has done some actual good (The application in a woman's hand, If that were credible, being scarcely spoilt,) In colonising beehives.” “There it is!— You play beside a death-bed like a child, Yet measure to yourself a prophet's place To teach the living. None of all these things Can women understand. You generalise Oh, nothing,—not even grief! Your quick-breathed hearts, So sympathetic to the personal pang, Close on each separate knife-stroke, yielding up A whole life at each wound, incapable Of deepening, widening a large lap of life To hold the world-full woe. The human race To you means, such a child, or such a man, You saw one morning waiting in the cold, Beside that gate, perhaps. You gather up A few such cases, and when strong sometimes Will write of factories and of slaves, as if Your father were a negro, and your son A spinner in the mills. All's yours and you, All, coloured with your blood, or otherwise Just nothing to you. Why, I call you hard To general suffering. Here's the world half-blind With intellectual light, half-brutalised With civilisation, having caught the plague In silks from Tarsus, shrieking east and west Along a thousand railroads, mad with pain And sin too! . . . does one woman of you all (You who weep easily) grow pale to see This tiger shake his cage?—does one of you Stand still from dancing, stop from stringing pearls, And pine and die because of the great sum Of universal anguish?—Show me a tear Wet as Cordelia's, in eyes bright as yours, Because the world is mad. You cannot count, That you should weep for this account, not you! You weep for what you know. A red-haired child Sick in a fever, if you touch him once, Though but so little as with a finger-tip, Will set you weeping; but a million sick . . . You could as soon weep for the rule of three Or compound fractions. Therefore, this same world, Uncomprehended by you, must remain Uninfluenced by you.—Women as you are, Mere women, personal and passionate, You give us doating mothers, and perfect wives, Sublime Madonnas, and enduring saints! We get no Christ from you,—and verily We shall not get a poet, in my mind.” “With which conclusion you conclude” . . . “But this,” That you, Aurora, with the large live brow And steady eyelids, cannot condescend To play at art, as children play at swords, To show a pretty spirit, chiefly admired Because true action is impossible. You never can be satisfied with praise Which men give women when they judge a book Not as mere work but as mere woman's work, Expressing the comparative respect Which means the absolute scorn. “Oh, excellent, “What grace, what facile turns, what fluent sweeps, “What delicate discernment . . . almost thought! “The book does honour to the sex, we hold. “Among our female authors we make room “For this fair writer, and congratulate “The country that produces in these times “Such women, competent to . . . spell.” “Stop there,” I answered, burning through his thread of talk With a quick flame of emotion,—“You have read My soul, if not my book, and argue well I would not condescend . . . we will not say To such a kind of praise (a worthless end Is praise of all kinds), but to such a use Of holy art and golden life. I am young, And peradventure weak—you tell me so— Through being a woman. And, for all the rest, Take thanks for justice. I would rather dance At fairs on tight-rope, till the babies dropped Their gingerbread for joy,—than shift the types For tolerable verse, intolerable To men who act and suffer. Better far Pursue a frivolous trade by serious means, Than a sublime art frivolously.” “You, Choose nobler work than either, O moist eyes And hurrying lips and heaving heart! We are young, Aurora, you and I. The world,—look round,— The world, we're come to late, is swollen hard With perished generations and their sins: The civiliser's spade grinds horribly On dead men's bones, and cannot turn up soil That's otherwise than fetid. All success Proves partial failure; all advance implies What's left behind; all triumph, something crushed At the chariot-wheels; all government, some wrong: And rich men make the poor, who curse the rich, Who agonise together, rich and poor, Under and over, in the social spasm And crisis of the ages. Here's an age That makes its own vocation! here we have stepped Across the bounds of time! here's nought to see, But just the rich man and just Lazarus, And both in torments, with a mediate gulf, Though not a hint of Abraham's bosom. Who Being man, Aurora, can stand calmly by And view these things, and never tease his soul For some great cure? No physic for this grief, In all the earth and heavens too?” “You believe In God, for your part?—ay? that He who makes Can make good things from ill things, best from worst, As men plant tulips upon dunghills when They wish them finest?” “True. A death-heat is The same as life-heat, to be accurate, And in all nature is no death at all, As men account of death, so long as God Stands witnessing for life perpetually, By being just God. That's abstract truth, I know, Philosophy, or sympathy with God: But I, I sympathise with man, not God (I think I was a man for chiefly this), And when I stand beside a dying bed, 'Tis death to me. Observe,—it had not much Consoled the race of mastodons to know, Before they went to fossil, that anon Their place would quicken with the elephant. They were not elephants but mastodons; And I, a man, as men are now and not As men may be hereafter, feel with men In the agonising present.” “Is it so,” I said, “my cousin? is the world so bad, While I hear nothing of it through the trees? The world was always evil,—but so bad?” “So bad, Aurora. Dear, my soul is grey With poring over the long sum of ill; So much for vice, so much for discontent, So much for the necessities of power, So much for the connivances of fear, Coherent in statistical despairs With such a total of distracted life, . . . To see it down in figures on a page, Plain, silent, clear, as God sees through the earth The sense of all the graves,—that's terrible For one who is not God, and cannot right The wrong he looks on. May I choose indeed, But vow away my years, my means, my aims, Among the helpers, if there's any help In such a social strait? The common blood That swings along my veins is strong enough To draw me to this duty.” Then I spoke. “I have not stood long on the strand of life, And these salt waters have had scarcely time To creep so high up as to wet my feet: I cannot judge these tides—I shall, perhaps. A woman's always younger than a man At equal years, because she is disallowed Maturing by the outdoor sun and air, And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk. Ah well, I know you men judge otherwise! You think a woman ripens, as a peach, In the cheeks chiefly. Pass it to me now; I'm young in age, and younger still, I think, As a woman. But a child may say amen To a bishop's prayer and feel the way it goes, And I, incapable to loose the knot Of social questions, can approve, applaud August compassion, Christian thoughts that shoot Beyond the vulgar white of personal aims. Accept my reverence.” There he glowed on me With all his face and eyes. “No other help?” Said he—“no more than so?” “What help?” I asked. “You'd scorn my help,—as Nature's self, you say, Has scorned to put her music in my mouth Because a woman's. Do you now turn round And ask for what a woman cannot give?” “For what she only can, I turn and ask,” He answered, catching up my hands in his, And dropping on me from his high-eaved brow The full weight of his soul,—“I ask for love, And that, she can; for life in fellowship Through bitter duties—that, I know she can; For wifehood—will she?” “Now,” I said, “may God Be witness 'twixt us two!” and with the word, Meseemed I floated into a sudden light Above his stature,—“am I proved too weak To stand alone, yet strong enough to bear Such leaners on my shoulder? poor to think, Yet rich enough to sympathise with thought? Incompetent to sing, as blackbirds can, Yet competent to love, like him?” I paused; Perhaps I darkened, as the lighthouse will That turns upon the sea. “It's always so. Anything does for a wife.” “Aurora, dear, And dearly honoured,”—he pressed in at once With eager utterance,—“you translate me ill. I do not contradict my thought of you Which is most reverent, with another thought Found less so. If your sex is weak for art (And I, who said so, did but honour you By using truth in courtship), it is strong For life and duty. Place your fecund heart In mine, and let us blossom for the world That wants love's colour in the grey of time. My talk, meanwhile, is arid to you, ay, Since all my talk can only set you where You look down coldly on the arena-heaps Of headless bodies, shapeless, indistinct! The Judgment-Angel scarce would find his way Through such a heap of generalised distress To the individual man with lips and eyes, Much less Aurora. Ah, my sweet, come down, And hand in hand we'll go where yours shall touch These victims, one by one! till, one by one, The formless, nameless trunk of every man Shall seem to wear a head with hair you know, And every woman catch your mother's face To melt you into passion.” “I am a girl,” I answered slowly; “you do well to name My mother's face. Though far too early, alas, God's hand did interpose 'twixt it and me, I know so much of love as used to shine In that face and another. Just so much; No more indeed at all. I have not seen So much love since, I pray you pardon me, As answers even to make a marriage with In this cold land of England. What you love Is not a woman, Romney, but a cause: You want a helpmate, not a mistress, sir, A wife to help your ends,—in her no end. Your cause is noble, your ends excellent, But I, being most unworthy of these and that, Do otherwise conceive of love. Farewell.” “Farewell, Aurora? you reject me thus?” He said. “Sir, you were married long ago. You have a wife already whom you love, Your social theory. Bless you both, I say. For my part, I am scarcely meek enough To be the handmaid of a lawful spouse. Do I look a Hagar, think you?” “So you jest.” “Nay, so, I speak in earnest,” I replied. “You treat of marriage too much like, at least, A chief apostle: you would bear with you A wife . . . a sister . . . shall we speak it out? A sister of charity.” “Then, must it be Indeed farewell? And was I so far wrong In hope and in illusion, when I took The woman to be nobler than the man, Yourself the noblest woman, in the use And comprehension of what love is,—love, That generates the likeness of itself Through all heroic duties? so far wrong, In saying bluntly, venturing truth on love, ‘Come, human creature, love and work with me,’— Instead of ‘Lady, thou art wondrous fair, ‘And, where the Graces walk before, the Muse ‘Will follow at the lightning of their eyes, ‘And where the Muse walks, lovers need to creep: ‘Turn round and love me, or I die of love.’” With quiet indignation I broke in. “You misconceive the question like a man, Who sees a woman as the complement Of his sex merely. You forget too much That every creature, female as the male, Stands single in responsible act and thought As also in birth and death. Whoever says To a loyal woman, ‘Love and work with me,’ Will get fair answers if the work and love, Being good themselves, are good for her—the best She was born for. Women of a softer mood, Surprised by men when scarcely awake to life, Will sometimes only hear the first word, love, And catch up with it any kind of work, Indifferent, so that dear love go with it. I do not blame such women, though, for love, They pick much oakum; earth's fanatics make Too frequently heaven's saints. But me your work Is not the best for,—nor your love the best, Nor able to commend the kind of work For love's sake merely. Ah, you force me, sir, To be overbold in speaking of myself: I too have my vocation,—work to do, The heavens and earth have set me since I changed My father's face for theirs, and, though your world Were twice as wretched as you represent, Most serious work, most necessary work As any of the economists'. Reform, Make trade a Christian possibility, And individual right no general wrong; Wipe out earth's furrows of the Thine and Mine, And leave one green for men to play at bowls, With innings for them all! . . . What then, indeed, If mortals are not greater by the head Than any of their prosperities? what then, Unless the artist keep up open roads Betwixt the seen and unseen,—bursting through The best of your conventions with his best, The speakable, imaginable best God bids him speak, to prove what lies beyond Both speech and imagination? A starved man Exceeds a fat beast: we'll not barter, sir, The beautiful for barley.—And, even so, I hold you will not compass your poor ends Of barley-feeding and material ease, Without a poet's individualism To work your universal. It takes a soul, To move a body: it takes a high-souled man, To move the masses, even to a cleaner stye: It takes the ideal, to blow a hair's-breadth off The dust of the actual.—Ah, your Fouriers failed, Because not poets enough to understand That life develops from within.—For me, Perhaps I am not worthy, as you say, Of work like this: perhaps a woman's soul Aspires, and not creates: yet we aspire, And yet I'll try out your perhapses, sir, And if I fail . . . why, burn me up my straw Like other false works—I'll not ask for grace; Your scorn is better, cousin Romney. I Who love my art, would never wish it lower To suit my stature. I may love my art. You'll grant that even a woman may love art, Seeing that to waste true love on anything Is womanly, past question.” I retain The very last word which I said that day, As you the creaking of the door, years past, Which let upon you such disabling news You ever after have been graver. He, His eyes, the motions in his silent mouth, Were fiery points on which my words were caught, Transfixed for ever in my memory For his sake, not their own. And yet I know I did not love him . . . nor he me . . . that's sure . . . And what I said is unrepented of, As truth is always. Yet . . . a princely man!— If hard to me, heroic for himself! He bears down on me through the slanting years, The stronger for the distance. If he had loved, Ay, loved me, with that retributive face, . . . I might have been a common woman now And happier, less known and less left alone, Perhaps a better woman after all, With chubby children hanging on my neck To keep me low and wise. Ah me, the vines That bear such fruit are proud to stoop with it. The palm stands upright in a realm of sand. And I, who spoke the truth then, stand upright, Still worthy of having spoken out the truth, By being content I spoke it though it set Him there, me here.—O woman's vile remorse, To hanker after a mere name, a show, A supposition, a potential love! Does every man who names love in our lives Become a power for that? is love's true thing So much best to us, that what personates love Is next best? A potential love, forsooth! I'm not so vile. No, no—he cleaves, I think, This man, this image,—chiefly for the wrong And shock he gave my life, in finding me Precisely where the devil of my youth Had set me, on those mountain-peaks of hope All glittering with the dawn-dew, all erect And famished for the noon,—exclaiming, while I looked for empire and much tribute, “Come, I have some worthy work for thee below. Come, sweep my barns and keep my hospitals, And I will pay thee with a current coin Which men give women.” As we spoke, the grass Was trod in haste beside us, and my aunt, With smile distorted by the sun,—face, voice As much at issue with the summer-day As if you brought a candle out of doors, Broke in with “Romney, here!—My child, entreat Your cousin to the house, and have your talk, If girls must talk upon their birthdays. Come.” He answered for me calmly, with pale lips That seemed to motion for a smile in vain, “The talk is ended, madam, where we stand. Your brother's daughter has dismissed me here; And all my answer can be better said Beneath the trees, than wrong by such a word Your house's hospitalities. Farewell.” With that he vanished. I could hear his heel Ring bluntly in the lane, as down he leapt The short way from us.—Then a measured speech Withdrew me. “What means this, Aurora Leigh? My brother's daughter has dismissed my guests?” The lion in me felt the keeper's voice Through all its quivering dewlaps; I was quelled Before her,—meekened to the child she knew: I prayed her pardon, said “I had little thought To give dismissal to a guest of hers, In letting go a friend of mine who came To take me into service as a wife,— No more than that, indeed.” “No more, no more? Pray Heaven,” she answered, “that I was not mad. I could not mean to tell her to her face That Romney Leigh had asked me for a wife, And I refused him?” “Did he ask?” I said; “I think he rather stooped to take me up For certain uses which he found to do For something called a wife. He never asked.” “What stuff!” she answered; “are they queens, these girls? They must have mantles, stitched with twenty silks, Spread out upon the ground, before they'll step One footstep for the noblest lover born.” “But I am born,” I said with firmness, “I, To walk another way than his, dear aunt.” “You walk, you walk! A babe at thirteen months Will walk as well as you,” she cried in haste, “Without a steadying finger. Why, you child, God help you, you are groping in the dark, For all this sunlight. You suppose, perhaps, That you, sole offspring of an opulent man, Are rich and free to choose a way to walk? You think, and it's a reasonable thought, That I, beside, being well to do in life, Will leave my handful in my niece's hand When death shall paralyse these fingers? Pray, Pray, child, albeit I know you love me not, As if you loved me, that I may not die! For when I die and leave you, out you go (Unless I make room for you in my grave), Unhoused, unfed, my dear poor brother's lamb (Ah heaven!—that pains!)—without a right to crop A single blade of grass beneath these trees, Or cast a lamb's small shadow on the lawn, Unfed, unfolded! Ah, my brother, here's The fruit you planted in your foreign loves!— Ay, there's the fruit he planted! never look Astonished at me with your mother's eyes, For it was they who set you where you are, An undowered orphan. Child, your father's choice Of that said mother disinherited His daughter, his and hers. Men do not think Of sons and daughters, when they fall in love, So much more than of sisters; otherwise He would have paused to ponder what he did, And shrunk before that clause in the entail Excluding offspring by a foreign wife (The clause set up a hundred years ago By a Leigh who wedded a French dancing-girl And had his heart danced over in return); But this man shrank at nothing, never thought Of you, Aurora, any more than me— Your mother must have been a pretty thing, For all the coarse Italian blacks and browns, To make a good man, which my brother was, Unchary of the duties to his house; But so it fell indeed. Our cousin Vane, Vane Leigh, the father of this Romney, wrote Directly on your birth, to Italy, ‘I ask your baby daughter for my son, In whom the entail now merges by the law. Betroth her to us out of love, instead Of colder reasons, and she shall not lose By love or law from henceforth’—so he wrote; A generous cousin was my cousin Vane. Remember how he drew you to his knee The year you came here, just before he died, And hollowed out his hands to hold your cheeks, And wished them redder,—you remember Vane. And now his son, who represents our house, And holds the fiefs and manors in his place, To whom reverts my pittance when I die (Except a few books and a pair of shawls), The boy is generous like him, and prepared To carry out his kindest word and thought To you, Aurora. Yes, a fine young man Is Romney Leigh; although the sun of youth Has shone too straight upon his brain, I know, And fevered him with dreams of doing good To good-for-nothing people. But a wife Will put all right, and stroke his temples cool With healthy touches.” . . . I broke in at that. I could not lift my heavy heart to breathe Till, then, but then I raised it, and it fell In broken words like these—“No need to wait: The dream of doing good to . . . me, at least, Is ended, without waiting for a wife To cool the fever for him. We've escaped That danger,—thank Heaven for it.” “You,” she cried, “Have got a fever. What, I talk and talk An hour long to you,—I instruct you how You cannot eat or drink or stand or sit Or even die, like any decent wretch In all this unroofed and unfurnished world, Without your cousin,—and you still maintain There's room 'twixt him and you for flirting fans And running knots in eyebrows? You must have A pattern lover sighing on his knee? You do not count enough, a noble heart (Above book-patterns) which this very morn Unclosed itself in two dear fathers' names To embrace your orphaned life? Fie, fie! But stay, I write a word, and counteract this sin.” She would have turned to leave me, but I clung. “O sweet my father's sister, hear my word Before you write yours. Cousin Vane did well, And cousin Romney well,—and I well too, In casting back with all my strength and will The good they meant me. O my God, my God! God meant me good, too, when He hindered me From saying ‘yes’ this morning. If you write A word, it shall be ‘no.’ I say no, no! I tie up ‘no’ upon His altar-horns, Quite out of reach of perjury! At least My soul is not a pauper; I can live At least my soul's life, without alms from men; And if it must be in heaven instead of earth, Let heaven look to it,—I am not afraid.” She seized my hands with both hers, strained them fast, And drew her probing and unscrupulous eyes Right through me, body and heart. “Yet, foolish Sweet, You love this man. I've watched you when he came, And when he went, and when we've talked of him: I am not old for nothing; I can tell The weather-signs of love: you love this man.” Girls blush sometimes because they are alive, Half wishing they were dead to save the shame. The sudden blush devours them, neck and brow; They have drawn too near the fire of life, like gnats, And flare up bodily, wings and all. What then? Who's sorry for a gnat . . . or girl? I blushed. I feel the brand upon my forehead now Strike hot, sear deep, as guiltless men may feel The felon's iron, say, and scorn the mark Of what they are not. Most illogical Irrational nature of our womanhood, That blushes one way, feels another way, And prays, perhaps, another! After all, We cannot be the equal of the male Who rules his blood a little. For although I blushed indeed, as if I loved the man, And her incisive smile, accrediting That treason of false witness in my blush, Did bow me downward like a swathe of grass Below its level that struck me,—I attest The conscious skies and all their daily suns, I think I loved him not,—nor then, nor since, Nor ever. Do we love the schoolmaster, Being busy in the woods? much less, being poor, The overseer of the parish? Do we keep Our love to pay our debts with? White and cold I grew next moment. As my blood recoiled From that imputed ignominy, I made My heart great with it. Then, at last, I spoke, Spoke veritable words but passionate, Too passionate perhaps . . . ground up with sobs To shapeless endings. She let fall my hands And took her smile off, in sedate disgust, As peradventure she had touched a snake,— A dead snake, mind!—and, turning round, replied, “We'll leave Italian manners, if you please. I think you had an English father, child, And ought to find it possible to speak A quiet ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ like English girls, Without convulsions. In another month We'll take another answer—no, or yes.” With that, she left me in the garden-walk. I had a father! yes, but long ago— How long it seemed that moment. Oh, how far, How far and safe, God, dost thou keep thy saints When once gone from us! We may call against The lighted windows of thy fair June-heaven Where all the souls are happy,—and not one, Not even my father, look from work or play To ask, “Who is it that cries after us, Below there, in the dusk?” Yet formerly He turned his face upon me quick enough, If I said “father.” Now I might cry loud; The little lark reached higher with his song Than I with crying. Oh, alone, alone,— Not troubling any in heaven, nor any on earth, I stood there in the garden, and looked up The deaf blue sky that brings the roses out On such June mornings. You who keep account Of crisis and transition in this life, Set down the first time Nature says plain “no” To some “yes” in you, and walks over you In gorgeous sweeps of scorn. We all begin By singing with the birds, and running fast With June-days, hand in hand: but once, for all, The birds must sing against us, and the sun Strike down upon us like a friend's sword caught By an enemy to slay us, while we read The dear name on the blade which bites at us!— That's bitter and convincing: after that, We seldom doubt that something in the large Smooth order of creation, though no more Than haply a man's footstep, has gone wrong. Some tears fell down my cheeks, and then I smiled, As those smile who have no face in the world To smile back to them. I had lost a friend In Romney Leigh; the thing was sure—a friend, Who had looked at me most gently now and then, And spoken of my favourite books, “our books,” With such a voice! Well, voice and look were now More utterly shut out from me I felt, Than even my father's. Romney now was turned To a benefactor, to a generous man, Who had tied himself to marry . . . me, instead Of such a woman, with low timorous lids He lifted with a sudden word one day, And left, perhaps, for my sake.—Ah, self-tied By a contract, male Iphigenia bound At a fatal Aulis for the winds to change (But loose him, they'll not change), he well might seem A little cold and dominant in love! He had a right to be dogmatical, This poor, good Romney. Love, to him, was made A simple law-clause. If I married him, I should not dare to call my soul my own Which so he had bought and paid for: every thought And every heart-beat down there in the bill; Not one found honestly deductible From any use that pleased him! He might cut My body into coins to give away Among his other paupers; change my sons, While I stood dumb as Griseld, for black babes Or piteous foundlings; might unquestioned set My right hand teaching in the Ragged Schools, My left hand washing in the Public Baths, What time my angel of the Ideal stretched Both his to me in vain. I could not claim The poor right of a mouse in a trap, to squeal, And take so much as pity from myself. Farewell, good Romney! if I loved you even, I could but ill afford to let you be So generous to me. Farewell, friend, since friend Betwixt us two, forsooth, must be a word So heavily overladen. And, since help Must come to me from those who love me not, Farewell, all helpers—I must help myself, And am alone from henceforth.—Then I stooped And lifted the soiled garland from the earth, And set it on my head as bitterly As when the Spanish monarch crowned the bones Of his dead love. So be it. I preserve That crown still,—in the drawer there! 'twas the first. The rest are like it;—those Olympian crowns, We run for, till we lose sight of the sun In the dust of the racing chariots! After that, Before the evening fell, I had a note, Which ran,—“Aurora, sweet Chaldean, you read My meaning backward like your eastern books, While I am from the west, dear. Read me now A little plainer. Did you hate me quite But yesterday? I loved you for my part; I love you. If I spoke untenderly This morning, my beloved, pardon it; And comprehend me that I loved you so I set you on the level of my soul, And overwashed you with the bitter brine Of some habitual thoughts. Henceforth, my flower, Be planted out of reach of any such, And lean the side you please, with all your leaves! Write woman's verses and dream woman's dreams; But let me feel your perfume in my home To make my sabbath after working-days. Bloom out your youth beside me,—be my wife.” I wrote in answer—“We Chaldeans discern Still farther than we read. I know your heart, And shut it like the holy book it is, Reserved for mild-eyed saints to pore upon Betwixt their prayers at vespers. Well, you're right, I did not surely hate you yesterday; And yet I do not love you enough to-day To wed you, cousin Romney. Take this word, And let it stop you as a generous man From speaking farther. You may tease, indeed, And blow about my feelings, or my leaves, And here's my aunt will help you with east winds And break a stalk, perhaps, tormenting me; But certain flowers grow near as deep as trees, And, cousin, you'll not move my root, not you, With all your confluent storms. Then let me grow Within my wayside hedge, and pass your way! This flower has never as much to say to you As the antique tomb which said to travellers, ‘Pause, ‘Siste, viator.’” Ending thus, I sighed. The next week passed in silence, so the next, And several after: Romney did not come Nor my aunt chide me. I lived on and on, As if my heart were kept beneath a glass, And everybody stood, all eyes and ears, To see and hear it tick. I could not sit, Nor walk, nor take a book, nor lay it down, Nor sew on steadily, nor drop a stitch, And a sigh with it, but I felt her looks Still cleaving to me, like the sucking asp To Cleopatra's breast, persistently Through the intermittent pantings. Being observed, When observation is not sympathy, Is just being tortured. If she said a word, A “thank you,” or an “if it please you, dear,” She meant a commination, or, at best, An exorcism against the devildom Which plainly held me. So with all the house. Susannah could not stand and twist my hair Without such glancing at the looking-glass To see my face there, that she missed the plait. And John,—I never sent my plate for soup, Or did not send it, but the foolish John Resolved the problem, 'twixt his napkined thumbs, Of what was signified by taking soup Or choosing mackerel. Neighbours who drooped in On morning visits, feeling a joint wrong, Smiled admonition, sat uneasily, And talked, with measured, emphasised reserve, Of parish news, like doctors to the sick, When not called in,—as if, with leave to speak, They might say something. Nay, the very dog Would watch me from his sun-patch on the floor, In alternation with the large black fly Not yet in reach of snapping. So I lived. A Roman died so; smeared with honey, teased By insects, stared to torture by the noon: And many patient souls 'neath English roofs Have died like Romans. I, in looking back, Wish only, now, I had borne the plague of all With meeker spirits than were rife at Rome. For, on the sixth week, the dead sea broke up, Dashed suddenly through beneath the heel of Him Who stands upon the sea and earth and swears Time shall be nevermore. The clock struck nine That morning too,—no lark was out of tune, The hidden farms among the hills breathed straight Their smoke toward heaven, the lime-tree scarcely stirred Beneath the blue weight of the cloudless sky, Though still the July air came floating through The woodbine at my window, in and out, With touches of the out-door country news For a bending forehead. There I sat, and wished That morning-truce of God would last till eve, Or longer. “Sleep,” I thought, “late sleepers,—sleep, And spare me yet the burden of your eyes.” Then, suddenly, a single ghastly shriek Tore upward from the bottom of the house. Like one who wakens in a grave and shrieks, The still house seemed to shriek itself alive, And shudder through its passages and stairs With slam of doors and clash of bells.—I sprang, I stood up in the middle of the room, And there confronted at my chamber-door A white face,—shivering, ineffectual lips. “Come, come,” they tried to utter, and I went: As if a ghost had drawn me at the point Of a fiery finger through the uneven dark, I went with reeling footsteps down the stair, Nor asked a question. There she sat, my aunt,— Bolt upright in the chair beside her bed, Whose pillow had no dint! she had used no bed For that night's sleeping, yet slept well. My God, The dumb derision of that grey, peaked face Concluded something grave against the sun, Which filled the chamber with its July burst When Susan drew the curtains ignorant Of who sat open-eyed behind her. There She sat . . . it sat . . . we said “she” yesterday . . . And held a letter with unbroken seal As Susan gave it to her hand last night: All night she had held it. If its news referred To duchies or to dunghills, not an inch She'd budge, 'twas obvious, for such worthless odds: Nor, though the stars were suns and overburned Their spheric limitations, swallowing up Like wax the azure spaces, could they force Those open eyes to wink once. What last sight Had left them blank and flat so,—drawing out The faculty of vision from the roots, As nothing more, worth seeing, remained behind? Were those the eyes that watched me, worried me? That dogged me up and down the hours and days, A beaten, breathless, miserable soul? And did I pray, a half-hour back, but so, To escape the burden of those eyes . . . those eyes? “Sleep late” I said?— Why, now, indeed, they sleep. God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers, And thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face, A gauntlet with a gift in't. Every wish Is like a prayer, with God. I had my wish, To read and meditate the thing I would, To fashion all my life upon my thought, And marry or not marry. Henceforth none Could disapprove me, vex me, hamper me. Full ground-room, in this desert newly made, For Babylon or Baalbec,—when the breath, Now choked with sand, returns for building towns. The heir came over on the funeral day, And we two cousins met before the dead, With two pale faces. Was it death or life That moved us? When the will was read and done, The official guests and witnesses withdrawn, We rose up in a silence almost hard, And looked at one another. Then I said, “Farewell, my cousin.” But he touched, just touched My hatstrings, tied for going (at the door The carriage stood to take me), and said low, His voice a little unsteady through his smile, “Siste, viator.” “Is there time,” I asked, “In these last days of railroads, to stop short Like Cæsar's chariot (weighing half a ton) On the Appian road, for morals?” “There is time,” He answered grave, “for necessary words, Inclusive, trust me, of no epitaph On man or act, my cousin. We have read A will, which gives you all the personal goods And funded moneys of your aunt.” “I thank Her memory for it. With three hundred pounds We buy, in England even, clear standing-room To stand and work in. Only two hours since, I fancied I was poor.” “And, cousin, still You're richer than you fancy. The will says, Three hundred pounds, and any other sum Of which the said testatrix dies possessed. I say she died possessed of other sums.” “Dear Romney, need we chronicle the pence? I'm richer than I thought—that's evident. Enough so.” “Listen rather. You've to do With business and a cousin,” he resumed, “And both, I fear, need patience. Here's the fact. The other sum (there is another sum, Unspecified in any will which dates After possession, yet bequeathed as much And clearly as those said three hundred pounds) Is thirty thousand. You will have it paid When? . . . where? My duty troubles you with words.” He struck the iron when the bar was hot; No wonder if my eyes sent out some sparks. “Pause there! I thank you. You are delicate In glosing gifts;—but I, who share your blood, Am rather made for giving, like yourself, Than taking, like your pensioners. Farewell.” He stopped me with a gesture of calm pride. “A Leigh,” he said, “gives largesse and gives love, But gloses never: if a Leigh could glose, He would not do it, moreover, to a Leigh, With blood trained up along nine centuries To hound and hate a lie from eyes like yours. And now we'll make the rest as clear: your aunt Possessed these moneys.” “You will make it clear, My cousin, as the honour of us both, Or one of us speaks vainly! that's not I. My aunt possessed this sum,—inherited From whom, and when? bring documents, prove dates.” “Why now indeed you throw your bonnet off As if you had time left for a logarithm! The faith's the want. Dear cousin, give me faith, And you shall walk this road with silken shoes, As clean as any lady of our house Supposed the proudest. Oh, I comprehend The whole position from your point of sight. I oust you from your father's halls and lands And make you poor by getting rich—that's law; Considering which, in common circumstance, You would not scruple to accept from me Some compensation, some sufficiency Of income—that were justice; but, alas, I love you,—that's mere nature; you reject My love,—that's nature also; and at once, You cannot, from a suitor disallowed, A hand thrown back as mine is, into yours Receive a doit, a farthing,—not for the world! That's woman's etiquette, and obviously Exceeds the claim of nature, law, and right, Unanswerable to all. I grant, you see, The case as you conceive it,—leave you room To sweep your ample skirts of womanhood, While, standing humbly squeezed against the wall, I own myself excluded from being just, Restrained from paying indubitable debts, Because denied from giving you my soul. That's my misfortune!—I submit to it As if, in some more reasonable age, 'Twould not be less inevitable. Enough. You'll trust me, cousin, as a gentleman, To keep your honour, as you count it, pure, Your scruples (just as if I thought them wise) Safe and inviolate from gifts of mine.” I answered mild but earnest. “I believe In no one's honour which another keeps, Nor man's nor woman's. As I keep, myself, My truth and my religion, I depute No father, though I had one this side death, Nor brother, though I had twenty, much less you, Though twice my cousin, and once Romney Leigh, To keep my honour pure. You face, to-day, A man who wants instruction, mark me, not A woman who wants protection. As to a man, Show manhood, speak out plainly, be precise With facts and dates. My aunt inherited This sum, you say—” “I said she died possessed Of this, dear cousin.” “Not by heritage. Thank you: we're getting to the facts at last. Perhaps she played at commerce with a ship Which came in heavy with Australian gold? Or touched a lottery with her finger-end, Which tumbled on a sudden into her lap Some old Rhine tower or principality? Perhaps she had to do with a marine Sub-transatlantic railroad, which pre-pays As well as pre-supposes? or perhaps Some stale ancestral debt was after-paid By a hundred years, and took her by surprise?— You shake your head, my cousin; I guess ill.” “You need not guess, Aurora, nor deride; The truth is not afraid of hurting you. You'll find no cause, in all your scruples, why Your aunt should cavil at a deed of gift 'Twixt her and me.” “I thought so—ah! a gift.” “You naturally thought so,” he resumed. “A very natural gift.” “A gift, a gift! Her individual life being stranded high Above all want, approaching opulence, Too haughty was she to accept a gift Without some ultimate aim: ah, ah, I see,— A gift intended plainly for her heirs, And so accepted . . . if accepted . . . ah, Indeed that might be; I am snared perhaps Just so. But, cousin, shall I pardon you, If thus you have caught me with a cruel springe?” He answered gently, “Need you tremble and pant Like a netted lioness? is't my fault, mine, That you're a grand wild creature of the woods And hate the stall built for you? Any way, Though triply netted, need you glare at me? I do not hold the cords of such a net; You're free from me, Aurora!” “Now may God Deliver me from this strait! This gift of yours Was tendered . . . when? accepted . . . when?” I asked. “A month . . . a fortnight since? Six weeks ago It was not tendered; by a word she dropped I know it was not tendered nor received. When was it? bring your dates.” “What matters when? A half-hour ere she died, or a half-year, Secured the gift, maintains the heritage Inviolable with law. As easy pluck The golden stars from heaven's embroidered stole To pin them on the grey side of this earth, As make you poor again, thank God.” “Net poor Nor clean again from henceforth, you thank God? Well, sir—I ask you—I insist at need,— Vouchsafe the special date, the special date.” “The day before her death-day,” he replied, “The gift was in her hands. We'll find that deed, And certify that date to you.” As one Who has climbed a mountain-height and carried up His own heart climbing, panting in his throat With the toil of the ascent, takes breath at last, Looks back in triumph—so I stood and looked. “Dear cousin Romney, we have reached the top Of this steep question, and may rest, I think. But first,—I pray you pardon, that the shock And surge of natural feeling and event Has made me oblivious of acquainting you That this, this letter (unread, mark, still sealed), Was found enfolded in the poor dead hand: That spirit of hers had gone beyond the address, Which could not find her though you wrote it clear,— I know your writing, Romney,—recognise The open-hearted A, the liberal sweep Of the G. Now listen,—let us understand: You will not find that famous deed of gift, Unless you find it in the letter here, Which, not being mine, I give you back.—Refuse To take the letter? well then—you and I, As writer and as heiress, open it Together, by your leave.—Exactly so: The words in which the noble offering's made Are nobler still, my cousin; and, I own, The proudest and most delicate heart alive, Distracted from the measure of the gift By such a grace in giving, might accept Your largesse without thinking any more Of the burthen of it, than King Solomon Considered, when he wore his holy ring Charactered over with the ineffable spell, How many carats of fine gold made up Its money-value: so, Leigh gives to Leigh! Or rather, might have given, observe,—for that's The point we come to. Here's a proof of gift, But here's no proof, sir, of acceptancy, But, rather, disproof. Death's black dust, being blown, Infiltrated through every secret fold Of this sealed letter by a puff of fate, Dried up for ever the fresh-written ink, Annulled the gift, disutilised the grace, And left these fragments.” As I spoke, I tore The paper up and down, and down and up And crosswise, till it fluttered from my hands, As forest-leaves, stripped suddenly and rapt By a whirlwind on Valdarno, drop again, Drop slow, and strew the melancholy ground Before the amazèd hills . . . why, so, indeed, I'm writing like a poet, somewhat large In the type of the image, and exaggerate A small thing with a great thing, topping it:— But then I'm thinking how his eyes looked, his, With what despondent and surprised reproach! I think the tears were in them as he looked; I think the manly mouth just trembled. Then He broke the silence. “I may ask, perhaps, Although no stranger . . . only Romney Leigh, Which means still less . . . than Vincent Carrington, Your plans in going hence, and where you go. This cannot be a secret.” “All my life Is open to you, cousin. I go hence To London, to the gathering-place of souls, To live mine straight out, vocally, in books; Harmoniously for others, if indeed A woman's soul, like man's, be wide enough To carry the whole octave (that's to prove), Or, if I fail, still purely for myself. Pray God be with me, Romney.” “Ah, poor child, Who fight against the mother's 'tiring hand, And choose the headsman's! May God change His world For your sake, sweet, and make it mild as heaven, And juster than I have found you.” But I paused. “And you, my cousin?”— “I,” he said,—“you ask? You care to ask? Well, girls have curious minds And fain would know the end of everything, Of cousins therefore with the rest. For me, Aurora, I've my work; you know my work; And, having missed this year some personal hope, I must beware the rather that I miss No reasonable duty. While you sing Your happy pastorals of the meads and trees, Bethink you that I go to impress and prove On stifled brains and deafened ears, stunned deaf, Crushed dull with grief, that nature sings itself, And needs no mediate poet, lute or voice, To make it vocal. While you ask of men Your audience, I may get their leave perhaps For hungry orphans to say audibly ‘We're hungry, see,’—for beaten and bullied wives To hold their unweaned babies up in sight, Whom orphanage would better, and for all To speak and claim their portion . . . by no means Of the soil, . . . but of the sweat in tilling it; Since this is nowadays turned privilege, To have only God's curse on us, and not man's. Such work I have for doing, elbow-deep In social problems,—as you tie your rhymes, To draw my uses to cohere with needs And bring the uneven world back to its round, Or, failing so much, fill up, bridge at least To smoother issues some abysmal cracks And feuds of earth, intestine heats have made To keep men separate,—using sorry shifts Of hospitals, almshouses, infant schools, And other practical stuff of partial good You lovers of the beautiful and whole Despise by system.” “I despise? The scorn Is yours, my cousin. Poets become such Through scorning nothing. You decry them for The good of beauty sung and taught by them, While they respect your practical partial good As being a part of beauty's self. Adieu! When God helps all the workers for His world, The singers shall have help of Him, not last.” He smiled as men smile when they will not speak Because of something bitter in the thought; And still I feel his melancholy eyes Look judgment on me. It is seven years since: I know not if 'twas pity or 'twas scorn Has made them so far-reaching: judge it ye Who have had to do with pity more than love And scorn than hatred. I am used, since then, To other ways, from equal men. But so, Even so, we let go hands, my cousin and I, And in between us rushed the torrent-world To blanch our faces like divided rocks, And bar for ever mutual sight and touch Except through swirl of spray and all that roar. THIRD BOOK. “To-day thou girdest up thy loins thyself And goest where thou wouldest: presently Others shall gird thee,” said the Lord, “to go Where thou wouldst not.” He spoke to Peter thus, To signify the death which he should die When crucified head downward. If He spoke To Peter then, He speaks to us the same; The word suits many different martyrdoms, And signifies a multiform of death, Although we scarcely die apostles, we, And have mislaid the keys of heaven and earth. For 'tis not in mere death that men die most, And, after our first girding of the loins In youth's fine linen and fair broidery To run up hill and meet the rising sun, We are apt to sit tired, patient as a fool, While others gird us with the violent bands Of social figments, feints, and formalisms, Reversing our straight nature, lifting up Our base needs, keeping down our lofty thoughts, Head downward on the cross-sticks of the world. Yet He can pluck us from that shameful cross. God, set our feet low and our forehead high, And show us how a man was made to walk! Leave the lamp, Susan, and go up to bed. The room does very well; I have to write Beyond the stroke of midnight. Get away; Your steps, for ever buzzing in the room, Tease me like gnats. Ah, letters! throw them down At once, as I must have them, to be sure, Whether I bid you never bring me such At such an hour, or bid you. No excuse; You choose to bring them, as I choose perhaps To throw them in the fire. Now get to bed, And dream, if possible, I am not cross. Why what a pettish, petty thing I grow,— A mere mere woman, a mere flaccid nerve, A kerchief left out all night in the rain, Turned soft so,—overtasked and overstrained And overlived in this close London life! And yet I should be stronger. Never burn Your letters, poor Aurora! for they stare With red seals from the table, saying each, “Here's something that you know not.” Out, alas, 'Tis scarcely that the world's more good and wise Or even straighter and more consequent Since yesterday at this time—yet, again, If but one angel spoke from Ararat I should be very sorry not to hear: So open all the letters! let me read. Blanche Ord, the writer in the “Lady's Fan,” Requests my judgment on . . . that, afterwards. Kate Ward desires the model of my cloak, And signs “Elisha to you.” Pringle Sharpe Presents his work on “Social Conduct,” craves A little money for his pressing debts . . From me, who scarce have money for my needs; Art's fiery chariot which we journey in Being apt to singe our singing-robes to holes, Although you ask me for my cloak, Kate Ward! Here's Rudgely knows it,—editor and scribe; He's “forced to marry where his heart is not, Because the purse lacks where he lost his heart.” Ah,—lost it because no one picked it up; That's really loss,—(and passable impudence). My critic Hammond flatters prettily, And wants another volume like the last. My critic Belfair wants another book Entirely different, which will sell (and live?), A striking book, yet not a startling book, The public blames originalities (You must not pump spring-water unawares Upon a gracious public full of nerves): Good things, not subtle, new yet orthodox, As easy reading as the dog-eared page That's fingered by said public fifty years, Since first taught spelling by its grandmother, And yet a revelation in some sort: That's hard, my critic Belfair. So—what next? My critic Stokes objects to abstract thoughts; “Call a man John, a woman Joan,” says he, “And do not prate so of humanities:” Whereat I call my critic simply, Stokes. My critic Jobson recommends more mirth Because a cheerful genius suits the times, And all true poets laugh unquenchably Like Shakespeare and the gods. That's very hard. The gods may laugh, and Shakespeare; Dante smiled With such a needy heart on two pale lips, We cry “Weep rather, Dante.” Poems are Men, if true poems: and who dares exclaim At any man's door, “Here, 'tis understood The thunder fell last week and killed a wife And scared a sickly husband—what of that? Get up, be merry, shout and clap your hands, Because a cheerful genius suits the times—”? None says so to the man, and why indeed Should any to the poem? A ninth seal; The apocalypse is drawing to a close. Ha,—this from Vincent Carrington,—“Dear friend, I want good counsel. Will you lend me wings To raise me to the subject, in a sketch I'll bring to-morrow—may I? at eleven? A poet's only born to turn to use: So save you! for the world . . . and Carrington.” “(Writ after.) Have you heard of Romney Leigh, Beyond what's said of him in newspapers, His phalansteries there, his speeches here, His pamphlets, pleas, and statements, everywhere? He dropped me long ago, but no one drops A golden apple—though indeed one day You hinted that, but jested. Well, at least You know Lord Howe who sees him . . . whom he sees And you see and I hate to see,—for Howe Stands high upon the brink of theories, Observes the swimmers and cries ‘Very fine,’ But keeps dry linen equally,—unlike That gallant breaster, Romney. Strange it is, Such sudden madness seizing a young man To make earth over again,—while I'm content To make the pictures. Let me bring the sketch. A tiptoe Danae, overbold and hot, Both arms a-flame to meet her wishing Jove Halfway, and burn him faster down; the face And breasts upturned and straining, the loose locks All glowing with the anticipated gold. Or here's another on the self-same theme. She lies here—flat upon her prison-floor, The long hair swathed about her to the heel Like wet seaweed. You dimly see her through The glittering haze of that prodigious rain, Half blotted out of nature by a love As heavy as fate. I'll bring you either sketch. I think, myself, the second indicates More passion.” Surely. Self is put away, And calm with abdication. She is Jove, And no more Danae—greater thus. Perhaps The painter symbolises unaware Two states of the recipient artist-soul, One, forward, personal, wanting reverence, Because aspiring only. We'll be calm, And know that, when indeed our Joves come down, We all turn stiller than we have ever been. Kind Vincent Carrington. I'll let him come. He talks of Florence,—and may say a word Of something as it chanced seven years ago, A hedgehog in the path, or a lame bird, In those green country walks, in that good time When certainly I was so miserable . . . I seem to have missed a blessing ever since. The music soars within the little lark, And the lark soars. It is not thus with men We do not make our places with our strains,— Content, while they rise, to remain behind Alone on earth instead of so in heaven. No matter; I bear on my broken tale. When Romney Leigh and I had parted thus, I took a chamber up three flights of stairs Not far from being as steep as some larks climb, And there, in a certain house in Kensington, Three years I lived and worked. Get leave to work In this world—'tis the best you get at all; For God, in cursing, gives us better gifts Than men in benediction. God says, “Sweat For foreheads,” men say “crowns,” and so we are crowned, Ay, gashed by some tormenting circle of steel Which snaps with a secret spring. Get work, get work; Be sure 'tis better than what you work to get. Serene and unafraid of solitude, I worked the short days out,—and watched the sun On lurid morns or monstrous afternoons (Like some Druidic idol's fiery brass With fixed unflickering outline of dead heat, From which the blood of wretches pent inside Seems oozing forth to incarnadine the air) Push out through fog with his dilated disk, And startle the slant roofs and chimney-pots With splashes of fierce colour. Or I saw Fog only, the great tawny weltering fog, Involve the passive city, strangle it Alive, and draw it off into the void, Spires, bridges, streets, and squares, as if a sponge Had wiped out London,—or as noon and night Had clapped together and utterly struck out The intermediate time, undoing themselves In the act. Your city poets see such things Not despicable. Mountains of the south, When drunk and mad with elemental wines They rend the seamless mist and stand up bare, Make fewer singers, haply. No one sings, Descending Sinai: on Parnassus mount You take a mule to climb and not a muse Except in fable and figure: forests chant Their anthems to themselves, and leave you dumb. But sit in London at the day's decline, And view the city perish in the mist Like Pharaoh's armaments in the deep Red Sea, The chariots, horsemen, footmen, all the host, Sucked down and choked to silence—then, surprised By a sudden sense of vision and of tune, You feel as conquerors though you did not fight, And you and Israel's other singing girls, Ay, Miriam with them, sing the song you choose. I worked with patience, which means almost power: I did some excellent things indifferently, Some bad things excellently. Both were praised, The latter loudest. And by such a time That I myself had set them down as sins Scarce worth the price of sackcloth, week by week Arrived some letter through the sedulous post, Like these I've read, and yet dissimilar, With pretty maiden seals,—initials twined Of lilies, or a heart marked Emily (Convicting Emily of being all heart); Or rarer tokens from young bachelors, Who wrote from college with the same goose-quill, Suppose, they had just been plucked of, and a snatch From Horace, “Collegisse juvat,” set Upon the first page. Many a letter, signed Or unsigned, showing the writers at eighteen Had lived too long, although a muse should help Their dawn by holding candles,—compliments To smile or sigh at. Such could pass with me No more than coins from Moscow circulate At Paris: would ten roubles buy a tag Of ribbon on the boulevard, worth a sou? I smiled that all this youth should love me,—sighed That such a love could scarcely raise them up To love what was more worthy than myself; Then sighed again, again, less generously, To think the very love they lavished so Proved me inferior. The strong loved me not, And he . . . my cousin Romney . . . did not write. I felt the silent finger of his scorn Prick every bubble of my frivolous fame As my breath blew it, and resolve it back To the air it came from. Oh, I justified The measure he had taken of my height: The thing was plain—he was not wrong a line; I played at art, made thrusts with a toy-sword, Amused the lads and maidens. Came a sigh Deep, hoarse with resolution,—I would work To better ends, or play in earnest. “Heavens, I think I should be almost popular If this went on!”—I ripped my verses up, And found no blood upon the rapier's point; The heart in them was just an embryo's heart Which never yet had beat, that it should die; Just gasps of make-believe galvanic life; Mere tones, inorganised to any tune. And yet I felt it in me where it burnt, Like those hot fire-seeds of creation held In Jove's clenched palm before the worlds were sown,— But I—I was not Juno even! my hand Was shut in weak convulsion, woman's ill, And when I yearned to loose a finger—lo, The nerve revolted. 'Tis the same even now: This hand may never, haply, open large, Before the spark is quenched, or the palm charred, To prove the power not else than by the pain. It burnt, it burns—my whole life burnt with it, And light, not sunlight and not torchlight, flashed My steps out through the slow and difficult road. I had grown distrustful of too forward Springs, The season's books in drear significance Of morals, dropping round me. Lively books? The ash has livelier verdure than the yew; And yet the yew's green longer, and alone Found worthy of the holy Christmas time: We'll plant more yews if possible, albeit We plant the graveyards with them. Day and night I worked my rhythmic thought, and furrowed up Both watch and slumber with long lines of life Which did not suit their season. The rose fell From either cheek, my eyes globed luminous Through orbits of blue shadow, and my pulse Would shudder along the purple-veinèd wrist Like a shot bird. Youth's stern, set face to face With youth's ideal: and when people came And said “You work too much, you are looking ill,” I smiled for pity of them who pitied me, And thought I should be better soon perhaps For those ill looks. Observe—“I,” means in youth Just I, the conscious and eternal soul With all its ends, and not the outside life, The parcel-man, the doublet of the flesh, The so much liver, lung, integument, Which make the sum of “I” hereafter when World-talkers talk of doing well or ill. I prosper if I gain a step, although A nail then pierced my foot: although my brain Embracing any truth froze paralysed, I prosper: I but change my instrument; I break the spade off, digging deep for gold, And catch the mattock up. I worked on, on. Through all the bristling fence of nights and days Which hedges time in from the eternities, I struggled,—never stopped to note the stakes Which hurt me in my course. The midnight oil Would stink sometimes; there came some vulgar needs: I had to live that therefore I might work, And, being but poor, I was constrained, for life, To work with one hand for the booksellers While working with the other for myself And art: you swim with feet as well as hands, Or make small way. I apprehended this,— In England no one lives by verse that lives; And, apprehending, I resolved by prose To make a space to sphere my living verse. I wrote for cyclopædias, magazines, And weekly papers, holding up my name To keep it from the mud. I learnt the use Of the editorial “we” in a review As courtly ladies the fine trick of trains, And swept it grandly through the open doors As if one could not pass through doors at all Save so encumbered. I wrote tales beside, Carved many an article on cherry-stones To suit light readers,—something in the lines Revealing, it was said, the mallet-hand, But that, I'll never vouch for: what you do For bread will taste of common grain, not grapes, Although you have a vineyard in Champagne; Much less in Nephelococcygia As mine was, peradventure. Having bread For just so many days, just breathing-room For body and verse, I stood up straight and worked My veritable work. And as the soul Which grows within a child makes the child grow,— Or as the fiery sap, the touch from God, Careering through a tree, dilates the bark And roughs with scale and knob, before it strikes The summer foliage out in a green flame— So life, in deepening with me, deepened all The course I took, the work I did. Indeed The academic law convinced of sin; The critics cried out on the falling off, Regretting the first manner. But I felt My heart's life throbbing in my verse to show It lived, it also—certes incomplete, Disordered with all Adam in the blood, But even its very tumours, warts and wens Still organised by and implying life. A lady called upon me on such a day. She had the low voice of your English dames, Unused, it seems, to need rise half a note To catch attention,—and their quiet mood, As if they lived too high above the earth For that to put them out in anything: So gentle, because verily so proud; So wary and afraid of hurting you, By no means that you are not really vile, But that they would not touch you with their foot To push you to your place; so self-possessed Yet gracious and conciliating, it takes An effort in their presence to speak truth: You know the sort of woman,—brilliant stuff, And out of nature. “Lady Waldemar.” She said her name quite simply, as if it meant Not much indeed, but something,—took my hands, And smiled as if her smile could help my case, And dropped her eyes on me and let them melt. “Is this,” she said, “the Muse”? “No sybil even,” I answered, “since she fails to guess the cause Which taxed you with this visit, madam.” “Good,” She said; “I value what's sincere at once. Perhaps if I had found a literal Muse, The visit might have taxed me. As it is, You wear your blue so chiefly in your eyes, My fair Aurora, in a frank good way, It comforts me entirely for your fame, As well as for the trouble of ascent To this Olympus.” There, a silver laugh Ran rippling through her quickened little breaths The steep stair somewhat justified. “But still Your ladyship has left me curious why You dared the risk of finding the said Muse?” “Ah,—keep me, notwithstanding, to the point, Like any pedant? Is the blue in eyes As awful as in stockings after all, I wonder, that you'd have my business out Before I breathe—exact the epic plunge In spite of gasps? Well, naturally you think I've come here, as the lion-hunters go To deserts, to secure you with a trap For exhibition in my drawing-rooms On zoologic soirées? Not in the least. Roar softly at me; I am frivolous, I dare say; I have played at wild-beast shows Like other women of my class,—but now I meet my lion simply as Androcles Met his . . . when at his mercy.” So, she bent Her head, as queens may mock,—then lifting up Her eyelids with a real grave queenly look, Which ruled and would not spare, not even herself,— “I think you have a cousin:—Romney Leigh.” “You bring a word from him?”—my eyes leapt up To the very height of hers,—“a word from him?” “I bring a word about him, actually. But first” (she pressed me with her urgent eyes), “You do not love him,—you?” “You're frank at least In putting questions, madam,” I replied; “I love my cousin cousinly—no more.” “I guessed as much. I'm ready to be frank In answering also, if you'll question me, Or even for something less. You stand outside, You artist women, of the common sex; You share not with us, and exceed us so Perhaps by what you're mulcted in, your hearts Being starved to make your heads: so run the old Traditions of you. I can therefore speak Without the natural shame which creatures feel When speaking on their level, to their like. There's many a papist she, would rather die Than own to her maid she put a ribbon on To catch the indifferent eye of such a man, Who yet would count adulteries on her beads At holy Mary's shrine and never blush; Because the saints are so far off, we lose All modesty before them. Thus, to-day. 'Tis I, love Romney Leigh.” “Forbear,” I cried. “If here's no Muse, still less is any saint; Nor even a friend, that Lady Waldemar Should make confessions” . . . “That's unkindly said: If no friend, what forbids to make a friend To join to our confession ere we have done? I love your cousin. If it seems unwise To say so, it's still foolisher (we're frank) To feel so. My first husband left me young, And pretty enough, so please you, and rich enough, To keep my booth in Mayfair with the rest To happy issues. There are marquises Would serve seven years to call me wife, I know, And, after seven, I might consider it, For there's some comfort in a marquisate When all's said,—yes, but after the seven years; I, now, love Romney. You put up your lip, So like a Leigh! so like him!—Pardon me, I'm well aware I do not derogate In loving Romney Leigh. The name is good, The means are excellent, but the man, the man— Heaven help us both,—I am near as mad as he, In loving such an one.” She slowly swung Her heavy ringlets till they touched her smile, As reasonably sorry for herself, And thus continued. “Of a truth, Miss Leigh, I have not, without struggle, come to this. I took a master in the German tongue, I gamed a little, went to Paris twice; But, after all, this love! . . . you eat of love, And do as vile a thing as if you ate Of garlic—which, whatever else you eat, Tastes uniformly acrid, till your peach Reminds you of your onion. Am I coarse? Well, love's coarse, nature's coarse—ah, there's the rub. We fair fine ladies, who park out our lives From common sheep-paths, cannot help the crows From flying over,—we're as natural still As Blowsalinda. Drape us perfectly In Lyons velvet,—we are not, for that, Lay-figures, look you: we have hearts within, Warm, live, improvident, indecent hearts, As ready for outrageous ends and acts As any distressed sempstress of them all That Romney groans and toils for. We catch love, And other fevers, in the vulgar way: Love will not be outwitted by our wit, Nor outrun by our equipages:—mine Persisted, spite of efforts. All my cards Turned up but Romney Leigh; my German stopped At germane Wertherism; my Paris rounds Returned me from the Champs Elysées just A ghost, and sighing like Dido's. I came home Uncured,—convicted rather to myself Of being in love . . . in love! That's coarse, you'll say, I'm talking garlic.” Coldly I replied: “Apologise for atheism, not love! For me, I do believe in love, and God. I know my cousin: Lady Waldemar I know not: yet I say as much as this,— Whoever loves him, let her not excuse But cleanse herself, that, loving such a man, She may not do it with such unworthy love He cannot stoop and take it.” “That is said Austerely, like a youthful prophetess, Who knits her brows across her pretty eyes To keep them back from following the grey flight Of doves between the temple-columns. Dear, Be kinder with me; let us two be friends. I'm a mere woman,—the more weak perhaps Through being so proud; you're better; as for him, He's best. Indeed he builds his goodness up So high, it topples down to the other side And makes a sort of badness; there's the worst I have to say against your cousin's best! And so be mild, Aurora, with my worst For his sake, if not mine.” “I own myself Incredulous of confidence like this Availing him or you.” “And I, myself, Of being worthy of him with any love: In your sense I am not so—let it pass. And yet I save him if I marry him; Let that pass too.” “Pass, pass! we play police Upon my cousin's life, to indicate What may or may not pass?” I cried. “He knows What's worthy of him; the choice remains with him; And what he chooses, act or wife, I think I shall not call unworthy, I, for one.” “'Tis somewhat rashly said,” she answered slow; “Now let's talk reason, though we talk of love. Your cousin Romney Leigh's a monster; there, The word's out fairly, let me prove the fact. We'll take, say, that most perfect of antiques They call the Genius of the Vatican (Which seems too beauteous to endure itself In this mixed world), and fasten it for once Upon the torso of the Dancing Faun (Who might limp surely, if he did not dance), Instead of Buonarroti's mask: what then? We show the sort of monster Romney is, With godlike virtues and heroic aims Subjoined to limping possibilities Of mismade human nature. Grant the man Twice godlike, twice heroic,—still he limps, And here's the point we come to.” “Pardon me, But, Lady Waldemar, the point's the thing We never come to.” “Caustic, insolent At need! I like you”—(there, she took my hands) “And now, my lioness, help Androcles, For all your roaring. Help me! for myself I would not say so—but for him. He limps So certainly, he'll fall into the pit A week hence,—so I lose him—so he is lost! For when he's fairly married, he a Leigh, To a girl of doubtful life, undoubtful birth, Starved out in London till her coarse-grained hands Are whiter than her morals,—even you May call his choice unworthy.” “Married! lost! He . . . Romney!” “Ah, you're moved at last,” she said. “These monsters, set out in the open sun, Of course throw monstrous shadows: those who think Awry, will scarce act straightly. Who but he? And who but you can wonder? He has been mad, The whole world knows, since first, a nominal man, He soured the proctors, tried the gowns-men's wits, With equal scorn of triangles and wine, And took no honours, yet was honourable. They'll tell you he lost count of Homer's ships In Melbourne's poor-bills, Ashley's factory bills,— Ignored the Aspasia we all dare to praise, For other women, dear, we could not name Because we're decent. Well, he had some right On his side probably; men always have Who go absurdly wrong. The living boor Who brews your ale exceeds in vital worth Dead Cæsar who ‘stops bungholes’ in the cask; And also, to do good is excellent, For persons of his income, even to boors: I sympathise with all such things. But he Went mad upon them . . . madder and more mad From college times to these,—as, going down hill, The faster still, the farther. You must know Your Leigh by heart: he has sown his black young curls With bleaching cares of half a million men Already. If you do not starve, or sin, You're nothing to him: pay the income-tax And break your heart upon't, he'll scarce be touched; But come upon the parish, qualified For the parish stocks, and Romney will be there To call you brother, sister, or perhaps A tenderer name still. Had I any chance With Mister Leigh, who am Lady Waldemar And never committed felony?” “You speak Too bitterly,” I said, “for the literal truth.” “The truth is bitter. Here's a man who looks For ever on the ground! you must be low, Or else a pictured ceiling overhead, Good painting thrown away. For me, I've done What women may—we're somewhat limited, We modest women—but I've done my best. —How men are perjured when they swear our eyes Have meaning in them! they're just blue or brown, They just can drop their lids a little. And yet Mine did more, for I read half Fourier through, Proudhon, Considérant, and Louis Blanc, With various others of his socialists, And, if I had been a fathom less in love, Had cured myself with gaping. As it was, I quoted from them prettily enough, Perhaps, to make them sound half rational To a saner man than he whene'er we talked (For which I dodged occasion)—learnt by heart His speeches in the Commons and elsewhere Upon the social question; heaped reports Of wicked women and penitentiaries On all my tables (with a place for Sue), And gave my name to swell subscription lists Toward keeping up the sun at nights in heaven, And other possible ends. All things I did, Except the impossible . . . such as wearing gowns Provided by the Ten Hours' movement: there I stopped—we must stop somewhere. He, meanwhile Unmoved as the Indian tortoise 'neath the world, Let all that noise go on upon his back: He would not disconcert or throw me out, 'Twas well to see a woman of my class With such a dawn of conscience. For the heart, Made firewood for his sake, and flaming up To his face,—he merely warmed his feet at it: Just deigned to let my carriage stop him short In park or street,—he leaning on the door With news of the committee which sat last On pickpockets at suck.” “You jest—you jest.” “As martyrs jest, dear (if you read their lives), Upon the axe which kills them. When all's done By me, . . . for him—you'll ask him presently The colour of my hair—he cannot tell, Or answers ‘dark’ at random; while, be sure, He's absolute on the figure, five or ten, Of my last subscription. Is it bearable, And I a woman?” “Is it reparable, Though I were a man?” “I know not. That's to prove. But, first, this shameful marriage?” “Ay?” I cried. “Then really there's a marriage?” “Yesterday I held him fast upon it. ‘Mister Leigh,’ Said I, ‘shut up a thing, it makes more noise. ‘The boiling town keeps secrets ill; I've known ‘Yours since last week. Forgive my knowledge so: ‘You feel I'm not the woman of the world ‘The world thinks; you have borne with me before ‘And used me in your noble work, our work, ‘And now you shall not cast me off because ‘You're at the difficult point, the join. 'Tis true ‘Even I can scarce admit the cogency ‘Of such a marriage . . . where you do not love ‘(Except the class), yet marry and throw your name ‘Down to the gutter, for a fire-escape ‘To future generations! 'tis sublime, ‘A great example, a true Genesis ‘Of the opening social era. But take heed, ‘This virtuous act must have a patent weight, ‘Or loses half its virtue. Make it tell, ‘Interpret it, and set it in the light, ‘And do not muffle it in a winter-cloak ‘As a vulgar bit of shame,—as if, at best, ‘A Leigh had made a misalliance and blushed ‘A Howard should know it.’ Then, I pressed him more: ‘He would not choose,’ I said, ‘that even his kin, . . . ‘Aurora Leigh, even . . . should conceive his act ‘Less sacrifice, more fantasy.’ At which He grew so pale, dear, . . . to the lips, I knew I had touched him. ‘Do you know her,’ he inquired, ‘My cousin Aurora?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, and lied (But truly we all know you by your books), And so I offered to come straight to you, Explain the subject, justify the cause, And take you with me to Saint Margaret's Court To see this miracle, this Marian Erle, This drover's daughter (she's not pretty, he swears), Upon whose finger, exquisitely pricked By a hundred needles, we're to hang the tie 'Twixt class and class in England,—thus indeed By such a presence, yours and mine, to lift The match up from the doubtful place. At once He thanked me sighing, murmured to himself ‘She'll do it perhaps, she's noble,’—thanked me twice, And promised, as my guerdon, to put off His marriage for a month.” I answered then. “I understand your drift imperfectly. You wish to lead me to my cousin's betrothed, To touch her hand if worthy, and hold her hand If feeble, thus to justify his match. So be it then. But how this serves your ends, And how the strange confession of your love Serves this, I have to learn—I cannot see.” She knit her restless forehead. “Then, despite, Aurora, that most radiant morning name, You're dull as any London afternoon. I wanted time, and gained it,—wanted you, And gain you! you will come and see the girl In whose most prodigal eyes the lineal pearl And pride of all your lofty race of Leighs Is destined to solution. Authorised By sight and knowledge, then, you'll speak your mind, And prove to Romney, in your brilliant way, He'll wrong the people and posterity (Say such a thing is bad for me and you, And you fail utterly), by concluding thus An execrable marriage. Break it up, Disroot it—peradventure presently We'll plant a better fortune in its place. Be good to me, Aurora, scorn me less For saying the thing I should not. Well I know I should not. I have kept, as others have, The iron rule of womanly reserve In lip and life, till now: I wept a week Before I came here.”—Ending, she was pale; The last words, haughtily said, were tremulous. This palfrey pranced in harness, arched her neck, And, only by the foam upon the bit, You saw she champed against it. Then I rose. “I love love: truth's no cleaner thing than love. I comprehend a love so fiery hot It burns its natural veil of august shame, And stands sublimely in the nude, as chaste As Medicean Venus. But I know, A love that burns through veils will burn through masks And shrivel up treachery. What, love and lie! Nay—go to the opera! your love's curable.” “I love and lie?” she said—“I lie, forsooth?” And beat her taper foot upon the floor, And smiled against the shoe,—“You're hard, Miss Leigh, Unversed in current phrases.—Bowling greens Of poets are fresher than the world's highways: Forgive me that I rashly blew the dust Which dims our hedges even, in your eyes, And vexed you so much. You find, probably, No evil in this marriage,—rather good Of innocence, to pastoralise in song: You'll give the bond your signature, perhaps, Beneath the lady's mark,—indifferent That Romney chose a wife could write her name, In witnessing he loved her.” “Loved!” I cried; “Who tells you that he wants a wife to love? He gets a horse to use, not love, I think: There's work for wives as well,—and after, straw, When men are liberal. For myself, you err Supposing power in me to break this match. I could not do it to save Romney's life, And would not to save mine.” “You take it so,” She said, “farewell then. Write your books in peace, As far as may be for some secret stir Now obvious to me,—for, most obviously, In coming hither I mistook the way.” Whereat she touched my hand and bent her head, And floated from me like a silent cloud That leaves the sense of thunder. I drew breath, Oppressed in my deliverance. After all, This woman breaks her social system up For love, so counted—the love possible To such,—and lilies are still lilies, pulled By smutty hands, though spotted from their white; And thus she is better haply, of her kind, Than Romney Leigh, who lives by diagrams, And crosses out the spontaneities Of all his individual, personal life With formal universals. As if man Were set upon a high stool at a desk To keep God's books for Him in red and black, And feel by millions! What, if even God Were chiefly God by living out Himself To an individualism of the Infinite, Eterne, intense, profuse,—still throwing up The golden spray of multitudinous worlds In measure to the proclive weight and rush Of His inner nature,—the spontaneous love Still proof and outflow of spontaneous life? Then live, Aurora. Two hours afterward, Within Saint Margaret's Court I stood alone, Close-veiled. A sick child, from an ague-fit, Whose wasted right hand gambled 'gainst his left With an old brass button in a blot of sun, Jeered weakly at me as I passed across The uneven pavement; while a woman, rouged Upon the angular cheek-bones, kerchief torn, Thin dangling locks, and flat lascivious mouth, Cursed at a window both ways, in and out, By turns some bed-rid creature and myself,— “Lie still there, mother! liker the dead dog You'll be to-morrow. What, we pick our way, Fine madam, with those damnable small feet! We cover up our face from doing good, As if it were our purse! What brings you here, My lady? Is't to find my gentleman Who visits his tame pigeon in the eaves? Our cholera catch you with its cramps and spasms, And tumble up your good clothes, veil and all, And turn your whiteness dead-blue.” I looked up; I think I could have walked through hell that day, And never flinched. “The dear Christ comfort you,” I said, “you must have been most miserable To be so cruel,”—and I emptied out My purse upon the stones: when, as I had cast The last charm in the cauldron, the whole court Went boiling, bubbling up, from all its doors And windows, with a hideous wail of laughs And roar of oaths, and blows perhaps . . . I passed Too quickly for distinguishing . . . and pushed A little side-door hanging on a hinge, And plunged into the dark, and groped and climbed The long, steep, narrow stair 'twixt broken rail And mildewed wall that let the plaster drop To startle me in the blackness. Still, up, up! So high lived Romney's bride. I paused at last Before a low door in the roof, and knocked. There came an answer like a hurried dove— “So soon? can that be Mister Leigh? so soon?” And, as I entered, an ineffable face Met mine upon the threshold. “Oh, not you, Not you!”—the dropping of the voice implied; “Then, if not you, for me not any one.” I looked her in the eyes, and held her hands, And said “I am his cousin,—Romney Leigh's; And here I come to see my cousin too.” She touched me with her face and with her voice, This daughter of the people. Such soft flowers From such rough roots? The people, under there, Can sin so, curse so, look so, smell so . . . faugh! Yet have such daughters? Nowise beautiful Was Marian Erle. She was not white nor brown, But could look either, like a mist that changed According to being shone on more or less: The hair, too, ran its opulence of curls In doubt 'twixt dark and bright, nor left you clear To name the colour. Too much hair perhaps (I'll name a fault here) for so small a head, Which seemed to droop on that side and on this, As a full-blown rose uneasy with its weight Though not a wind should trouble it. Again, The dimple in the cheek had better gone With redder, fuller rounds; and somewhat large The mouth was, though the milky little teeth Dissolved it to so infantine a smile. For soon it smiled at me; the eyes smiled too, But 'twas as if remembering they had wept, And knowing they should, some day, weep again. We talked. She told me all her story out, Which I'll re-tell with fuller utterance, As coloured and confirmed in after times By others and herself too. Marian Erle Was born upon the ledge of Malvern Hill, To eastward, in a hut built up at night, To evade the landlord's eye, of mud and turf, Still liable, if once he looked that way, To being straight levelled, scattered by his foot, Like any other anthill. Born, I say; God sent her to His world, commissioned right, Her human testimonials fully signed, Not scant in soul—complete in lineaments; But others had to swindle her a place To wail in when she had come. No place for her, By man's law! born an outlaw was this babe; Her first cry in our strange and strangling air, When cast in spasms out by the shuddering womb, Was wrong against the social code,—forced wrong:— What business had the baby to cry there? I tell her story and grow passionate. She, Marian, did not tell it so, but used Meek words that made no wonder of herself For being so sad a creature. “Mister Leigh “Considered truly that such things should change. “They will, in heaven—but meantime, on the earth, “There's none can like a nettle as a pink, “Except himself. We're nettles, some of us, “And give offence by the act of springing up; “And, if we leave the damp side of the wall, “The hoes, of course, are on us.” So she said. Her father earned his life by random jobs Despised by steadier workmen—keeping swine On commons, picking hops, or hurrying on The harvest at wet seasons, or, at need, Assisting the Welsh drovers, when a drove Of startled horses plunged into the mist Below the mountain-road, and sowed the wind With wandering neighings. In between the gaps Of such irregular work he drank and slept, And cursed his wife because, the pence being out, She could not buy more drink. At which she turned (The worm), and beat her baby in revenge For her own broken heart. There's not a crime But takes its proper change out still in crime If once rung on the counter of this world: Let sinners look to it. Yet the outcast child, For whom the very mother's face forwent The mother's special patience, lived and grew; Learnt early to cry low, and walk alone, With that pathetic vacillating roll Of the infant body on the uncertain feet (The earth being felt unstable ground so soon), At which most women's arms unclose at once With irrepressive instinct. Thus, at three, This poor weaned kid would run off from the fold, This babe would steal off from the mother's chair, And, creeping through the golden walls of gorse, Would find some keyhole toward the secresy Of Heaven's high blue, and, nestling down, peer out— Oh, not to catch the angels at their games,— She had never heard of angels,—but to gaze She knew not why, to see she knew not what, A-hungering outward from the barren earth For something like a joy. She liked, she said, To dazzle black her sight against the sky, For then, it seemed, some grand blind Love came down, And groped her out, and clasped her with a kiss; She learnt God that way, and was beat for it Whenever she went home,—yet came again, As surely as the trapped hare, getting free, Returns to his form. This grand blind Love, she said, This skyey father and mother both in one, Instructed her and civilised her more Than even Sunday-school did afterward, To which a lady sent her to learn books And sit upon a long bench in a row With other children. Well, she laughed sometimes To see them laugh and laugh and maul their texts; But ofter she was sorrowful with noise And wondered if their mothers beat them hard That ever they should laugh so. There was one She loved indeed,—Rose Bell, a seven years' child, So pretty and clever, who read syllables When Marian was at letters; she would laugh At nothing—hold your finger up, she laughed, Then shook her curls down over eyes and mouth To hide her make-mirth from the school-master: And Rose's pelting glee, as frank as rain On cherry-blossoms, brightened Marian too, To see another merry whom she loved. She whispered once (the children side by side, With mutual arms entwined about their necks) “Your mother lets you laugh so?” “Ay,” said Rose, “She lets me. She was dug into the ground Six years since, I being but a yearling wean. Such mothers let us play and lose our time, And never scold nor beat us! Don't you wish You had one like that?” There, Marian breaking off Looked suddenly in my face. “Poor Rose,” said she, “I heard her laugh last night in Oxford Street. I'd pour out half my blood to stop that laugh. Poor Rose, poor Rose!” said Marian. She resumed. It tried her, when she had learnt at Sunday-school What God was, what He wanted from us all, And how in choosing sin we vexed the Christ, To go straight home and hear her father pull The Name down on us from the thunder-shelf, Then drink away his soul into the dark From seeing judgment. Father, mother, home, Were God and heaven reversed to her: the more She knew of Right, the more she guessed their wrong: Her price paid down for knowledge, was to know The vileness of her kindred: through her heart, Her filial and tormented heart, henceforth, They struck their blows at virtue. Oh, 'tis hard To learn you have a father up in heaven By a gathering certain sense of being, on earth, Still worse than orphaned: 'tis too heavy a grief, The having to thank God for such a joy! And so passed Marian's life from year to year. Her parents took her with them when they tramped, Dodged lanes and heaths, frequented towns and fairs, And once went farther and saw Manchester, And once the sea, that blue end of the world, That fair scroll-finis of a wicked book,— And twice a prison,—back at intervals, Returning to the hills. Hills draw like heaven, And stronger sometimes, holding out their hands To pull you from the vile flats up to them. And though perhaps these strollers still strolled back, As sheep do, simply that they knew the way, They certainly felt bettered unaware Emerging from the social smut of towns To wipe their feet clean on the mountain turf. In which long wanderings, Marian lived and learned, Endured and learned. The people on the roads Would stop and ask her why her eyes outgrew Her cheeks, and if she meant to lodge the birds In all that hair; and then they lifted her, The miller in his cart, a mile or twain, The butcher's boy on horseback. Often too The pedlar stopped, and tapped her on the head With absolute forefinger, brown and ringed, And asked if peradventure she could read, And when she answered “ay,” would toss her down Some stray odd volume from his heavy pack, A Thomson's Seasons, mulcted of the Spring, Or half a play of Shakespeare's, torn across (She had to guess the bottom of a page By just the top sometimes,—as difficult, As, sitting on the moon, to guess the earth!), Or else a sheaf of leaves (for that small Ruth's Small gleanings) torn out from the heart of books, From Churchyard Elegies and Edens Lost, From Burns, and Bunyan, Selkirk, and Tom Jones,— 'Twas somewhat hard to keep the things distinct, And oft the jangling influence jarred the child Like looking at a sunset full of grace Through a pothouse window while the drunken oaths Went on behind her. But she weeded out Her book-leaves, threw away the leaves that hurt (First tore them small, that none should find a word), And made a nosegay of the sweet and good To fold within her breast, and pore upon At broken moments of the noontide glare, When leave was given her to untie her cloak And rest upon the dusty highway's bank From the road's dust: or oft, the journey done, Some city friend would lead her by the hand To hear a lecture at an institute. And thus she had grown, this Marian Erle of ours, To no book-learning,—she was ignorant Of authors,—not in earshot of the things Outspoken o'er the heads of common men By men who are uncommon,—but within The cadenced hum of such, and capable Of catching from the fringes of the wing Some fragmentary phrases, here and there, Of that fine music,—which, being carried in To her soul, had reproduced itself afresh In finer motions of the lips and lids. She said, in speaking of it, “If a flower Were thrown you out of heaven at intervals, You'd soon attain to a trick of looking up,— And so with her.” She counted me her years, Till I felt old; and then she counted me Her sorrowful pleasures, till I felt ashamed. She told me she was fortunate and calm On such and such a season, sat and sewed, With no one to break up her crystal thoughts, While rhymes from lovely poems span around Their ringing circles of ecstatic tune, Beneath the moistened finger of the Hour. Her parents called her a strange, sickly child, Not good for much, and given to sulk and stare, And smile into the hedges and the clouds, And tremble if one shook her from her fit By any blow, or word even. Out-door jobs Went ill with her, and household quiet work She was not born to. Had they kept the north, They might have had their pennyworth out of her, Like other parents, in the factories (Your children work for you, not you for them, Or else they better had been choked with air The first breath drawn); but, in this tramping life, Was nothing to be done with such a child But tramp and tramp. And yet she knitted hose Not ill, and was not dull at needlework; And all the country people gave her pence For darning stockings past their natural age, And patching petticoats from old to new, And other light work done for thrifty wives. One day, said Marian—the sun shone that day— Her mother had been badly beat, and felt The bruises sore about her wretched soul (That must have been): she came in suddenly, And snatching in a sort of breathless rage Her daughter's headgear comb, let down the hair Upon her like a sudden waterfall, Then drew her drenched and passive by the arm Outside the hut they lived in. When the child Could clear her blinded face from all that stream Of tresses . . . there, a man stood, with beast's eyes That seemed as they would swallow her alive Complete in body and spirit, hair and all,— And burning stertorous breath that hurt her cheek, He breathed so near. The mother held her tight, Saying hard between her teeth—“Why wench, why wench, The squire speaks to you now—the squire's too good: He means to set you up, and comfort us. Be mannerly at least.” The child turned round And looked up piteous in the mother's face (Be sure that mother's death-bed will not want Another devil to damn, than such a look), “Oh, mother!” then, with desperate glance to heaven, “God, free me from my mother,” she shrieked out, “These mothers are too dreadful.” And, with force As passionate as fear, she tore her hands, Like lilies from the rocks, from hers and his, And sprang down, bounded headlong down the steep, Away from both—away, if possible, As far as God,—away! They yelled at her, As famished hounds at a hare. She heard them yell; She felt her name hiss after her from the hills, Like shot from guns. On, on. And now she had cast The voices off with the uplands. On. Mad fear Was running in her feet and killing the ground; The white roads curled as if she burnt them up, The green fields melted, wayside trees fell back To make room for her. Then her head grew vexed; Trees, fields, turned on her and ran after her; She heard the quick pants of the hills behind, Their keen air pricked her neck: she had lost her feet, Could run no more, yet somehow went as fast, The horizon red 'twixt steeples in the east So sucked her forward, forward, while her heart Kept swelling, swelling, till it swelled so big It seemed to fill her body,—when it burst And overflowed the world and swamped the light; “And now I am dead and safe,” thought Marian Erle— She had dropped, she had fainted. As the sense returned, The night had passed—not life's night. She was 'ware Of heavy tumbling motions, creaking wheels, The driver shouting to the lazy team That swung their rankling bells against her brain, While, through the waggon's coverture and chinks, The cruel yellow morning pecked at her Alive or dead upon the straw inside,— At which her soul ached back into the dark And prayed, “no more of that.” A waggoner Had found her in a ditch beneath the moon, As white as moonshine save for the oozing blood. At first he thought her dead; but when he had wiped The mouth and heard it sigh, he raised her up, And laid her in his waggon in the straw, And so conveyed her to the distant town To which his business called himself, and left That heap of misery at the hospital. She stirred;—the place seemed new and strange as death. The white strait bed, with others strait and white, Like graves dug side by side at measured lengths, And quiet people walking in and out With wonderful low voices and soft steps And apparitional equal care for each, Astonished her with order, silence, law. And when a gentle hand held out a cup, She took it, as you do at sacrament, Half awed, half melted,—not being used, indeed, To so much love as makes the form of love And courtesy of manners. Delicate drinks And rare white bread, to which some dying eyes Were turned in observation. O my God, How sick we must be, ere we make men just! I think it frets the saints in heaven to see How many desolate creatures on the earth Have learnt the simple dues of fellowship And social comfort, in a hospital, As Marian did. She lay there, stunned, half tranced, And wished, at intervals of growing sense, She might be sicker yet, if sickness made The world so marvellous kind, the air so hushed, And all her wake-time quiet as a sleep; For now she understood (as such things were) How sickness ended very oft in heaven Among the unspoken raptures:—yet more sick, And surelier happy. Then she dropped her lids, And, folding up her hands as flowers at night, Would lose no moment of the blessed time. She lay and seethed in fever many weeks, But youth was strong and overcame the test; Revolted soul and flesh were reconciled And fetched back to the necessary day And daylight duties. She could creep about The long bare rooms, and stare out drearily From any narrow window on the street, Till some one who had nursed her as a friend Said coldly to her, as an enemy, “She had leave to go next week, being well enough,” (While only her heart ached). “Go next week,” thought she: “Next week! how would it be with her next week, Let out into that terrible street alone Among the pushing people, . . . to go . . . where?” One day, the last before the dreaded last, Among the convalescents, like herself Prepared to go next morning, she sat dumb, And heard half absently the women talk,— How one was famished for her baby's cheeks, “The little wretch would know her! a year old And lively, like his father!”—one was keen To get to work, and fill some clamorous mouths; And one was tender for her dear goodman Who had missed her sorely,—and one, querulous . . . “Would pay backbiting neighbours who had dared To talk about her as already dead,”— And one was proud . . . “and if her sweetheart Luke Had left her for a ruddier face than hers (The gossip would be seen through at a glance), Sweet riddance of such sweethearts—let him hang! 'Twere good to have been sick for such an end.” And while they talked, and Marian felt the worse For having missed the worst of all their wrongs, A visitor was ushered through the wards And paused among the talkers. “When he looked It was as if he spoke, and when he spoke He sang perhaps,” said Marian; “could she tell? She only knew” (so much she had chronicled, As seraphs might the making of the sun) “That he who came and spake was Romney Leigh, And then and there she saw and heard him first.” And when it was her turn to have the face Upon her, all those buzzing pallid lips Being satisfied with comfort—when he changed To Marian, saying “And you? you're going, where?”— She, moveless as a worm beneath a stone Which some one's stumbling foot has spurned aside, Writhed suddenly, astonished with the light, And, breaking into sobs, cried “Where I go? None asked me till this moment. Can I say Where I go,—when it has not seemed worth while To God Himself, who thinks of every one, To think of me and fix where I shall go?” “So young,” he gently asked her, “you have lost Your father and your mother?” “Both,” she said, “Both lost! my father was burnt up with gin Or ever I sucked milk, and so is lost. My mother sold me to a man last month, And so my mother's lost, 'tis manifest. And I, who fled from her for miles and miles, As if I had caught sight of the fire of hell Through some wild gap (she was my mother, sir), It seems I shall be lost too, presently, And so we end, all three of us.” “Poor child,” He said,—with such a pity in his voice, It soothed her more than her own tears,—“poor child! 'Tis simple that betrayal by mother's love Should bring despair of God's too. Yet be taught, He's better to us than many mothers are, And children cannot wander beyond reach Of the sweep of his white raiment. Touch and hold! And if you weep still, weep where John was laid While Jesus loved him.” “She could say the words,” She told me, “exactly as he uttered them A year back, since in any doubt or dark They came out like the stars, and shone on her With just their comfort. Common words, perhaps; The ministers in church might say the same; But he, he made the church with what he spoke,— The difference was the miracle,” said she. Then catching up her smile to ravishment, She added quickly, “I repeat his words, But not his tones: can any one repeat The music of an organ, out of church? And when he said ‘poor child,’ I shut my eyes To feel how tenderly his voice broke through, As the ointment-box broke on the Holy feet To let out the rich medicative nard.” She told me how he had raised and rescued her With reverent pity, as, in touching grief, He touched the wounds of Christ,—and made her feel More self-respecting. Hope he called belief In God,—work, worship,—therefore let us pray! And thus, to snatch her soul from atheism, And keep it stainless from her mother's face, He sent her to a famous sempstress-house Far off in London, there to work and hope. With that, they parted. She kept sight of Heaven, But not of Romney. He had good to do To others: through the days and through the nights She sewed and sewed and sewed. She drooped sometimes, And wondered, while along the tawny light She struck the new thread into her needle's eye, How people without mothers on the hills Could choose the town to live in!—then she drew The stitch, and mused how Romney's face would look, And if 'twere likely he'd remember hers When they two had their meeting after death. FOURTH BOOK. They met still sooner. 'Twas a year from thence That Lucy Gresham, the sick sempstress girl, Who sewed by Marian's chair so still and quick, And leant her head upon its back to cough More freely, when, the mistress turning round, The others took occasion to laugh out, Gave up at last. Among the workers, spoke A bold girl with black eyebrows and red lips: “You know the news? Who's dying, do you think? Our Lucy Gresham. I expected it As little as Nell Hart's wedding. Blush not, Nell, Thy curls be red enough without thy cheeks, And, some day, there'll be found a man to dote On red curls.—Lucy Gresham swooned last night, Dropped sudden in the street while going home; And now the baker says, who took her up And laid her by her grandmother in bed, He'll give her a week to die in. Pass the silk. Let's hope he gave her a loaf too, within reach, For otherwise they'll starve before they die, That funny pair of bedfellows! Miss Bell, I'll thank you for the scissors. The old crone Is paralytic—that's the reason why Our Lucy's thread went faster than her breath, Which went too quick, we all know. Marian Erle, Why, Marian Erle, you're not the fool to cry? Your tears spoil Lady Waldemar's new dress, You piece of pity!” Marian rose up straight, And, breaking through the talk and through the work, Went outward, in the face of their surprise, To Lucy's home, to nurse her back to life Or down to death. She knew, by such an act, All place and grace were forfeit in the house, Whose mistress would supply the missing hand With necessary, not inhuman haste, And take no blame. But pity, too, had dues: She could not leave a solitary soul To founder in the dark, while she sat still And lavished stitches on a lady's hem As if no other work were paramount. “Why, God,” thought Marian, “has a missing hand This moment; Lucy wants a drink, perhaps. Let others miss me! never miss me, God!” So Marian sat by Lucy's bed, content With duty, and was strong, for recompense, To hold the lamp of human love arm-high, To catch the death-strained eyes and comfort them, Until the angels, on the luminous side Of death, had got theirs ready. And she said, If Lucy thanked her sometimes, called her kind, It touched her strangely. “Marian Erle called kind! What, Marian, beaten and sold, who could not die! 'Tis verily good fortune to be kind. Ah you,” she said, “who are born to such a grace, Be sorry for the unlicensed class, the poor, Reduced to think the best good fortune means That others, simply, should be kind to them.” From sleep to sleep when Lucy had slid away So gently, like the light upon a hill, Of which none names the moment that it goes Though all see when 'tis gone,—a man came in And stood beside the bed. The old idiot wretch Screamed feebly, like a baby overlain, “Sir, sir, you won't mistake me for the corpse? Don't look at me, sir! never bury me! Although I lie here, I'm alive as you, Except my legs and arms,—I eat and drink And understand,—(that you're the gentleman Who fits the funerals up, Heaven speed you, sir), And certainly I should be livelier still If Lucy here . . . sir, Lucy is the corpse . . . Had worked more properly to buy me wine; But Lucy, sir, was always slow at work, I shan't lose much by Lucy. Marian Erle, Speak up and show the gentleman the corpse.” And then a voice said “Marian Erle.” She rose; It was the hour for angels—there, stood hers! She scarcely marvelled to see Romney Leigh. As light November snows to empty nests, As grass to graves, as moss to mildewed stones, As July suns to ruins, through the rents, As ministering spirits to mourners, through a loss, As Heaven itself to men, through pangs of death, He came uncalled wherever grief had come. “And so,” said Marian Erle, “we met anew,” And added softly, “so, we shall not part.” He was not angry that she had left the house Wherein he placed her. Well—she had feared it might Have vexed him. Also, when he found her set On keeping, though the dead was out of sight, That half-dead, half-alive body left behind With cankerous heart and flesh, which took your best And cursed you for the little good it did (Could any leave the bed-rid wretch alone, So joyless she was thankless even to God, Much more to you?), he did not say 'twas well, Yet Marian thought he did not take it ill,— Since day by day he came, and every day She felt within his utterance and his eyes A closer, tenderer presence of the soul, Until at last he said “We shall not part.” On that same day was Marian's work complete: She had smoothed the empty bed, and swept the floor Of coffin sawdust, set the chairs anew The dead had ended gossip in, and stood In that poor room so cold and orderly, The door-key in her hand, prepared to go As they had, howbeit not their way. He spoke. “Dear Marian, of one clay God made us all, And though men push and poke and paddle in't (As children play at fashioning dirt-pies) And call their fancies by the name of facts, Assuming difference, lordship, privilege, When all's plain dirt,—they come back to it at last, The first grave-digger proves it with a spade, And pats all even. Need we wait for this, You, Marian, and I, Romney?” She, at that, Looked blindly in his face, as when one looks Through driving autumn-rains to find the sky. He went on speaking. “Marian, I being born What men call noble, and you, issued from The noble people,—though the tyrannous sword, Which pierced Christ's heart, has cleft the world in twain 'Twixt class and class, opposing rich to poor, Shall we keep parted? Not so. Let us lean And strain together rather, each to each, Compress the red lips of this gaping wound As far as two souls can,—ay, lean and league, I from my superabundance,—from your want You,—joining in a protest 'gainst the wrong On both sides.” All the rest, he held her hand In speaking, which confused the sense of much. Her heart against his words beat out so thick, They might as well be written on the dust Where some poor bird, escaping from hawk's beak, Has dropped and beats its shuddering wings,—the lines Are rubbed so,—yet 'twas something like to this, —“That they two, standing at the two extremes Of social classes, had received one seal, Been dedicate and drawn beyond themselves To mercy and ministration,—he, indeed, Through what he knew, and she, through what she felt, He, by man's conscience, she, by woman's heart, Relinquishing their several 'vantage posts Of wealthy ease and honourable toil, To work with God at love. And since God willed That putting out his hand to touch this ark He found a woman's hand there, he'd accept The sign too, hold the tender fingers fast, And say ‘My fellow-worker, be my wife!’” She told the tale with simple, rustic turns,— Strong leaps of meaning in her sudden eyes That took the gaps of any imperfect phrase Of the unschooled speaker: I have rather writ The thing I understood so, than the thing I heard so. And I cannot render right Her quick gesticulation, wild yet soft, Self-startled from the habitual mood she used, Half sad, half languid,—like dumb creatures (now A rustling bird, and now a wandering deer, Or squirrel 'gainst the oak-gloom flashing up His sidelong burnished head, in just her way Of savage spontaneity), that stir Abruptly the green silence of the woods, And make it stranger, holier, more profound; As Nature's general heart confessed itself Of life, and then fell backward on repose. I kissed the lips that ended.—“So indeed He loves you, Marian?” “Loves me!” She looked up With a child's wonder when you ask him first Who made the sun—a puzzled blush, that grew, Then broke off in a rapid radiant smile Of sure solution. “Loves me! he loves all,— And me, of course. He had not asked me else To work with him for ever and be his wife.” Her words reproved me. This perhaps was love— To have its hands too full of gifts to give, For putting out a hand to take a gift; To love so much, the perfect round of love Includes, in strict conclusion, being loved; As Eden-dew went up and fell again, Enough for watering Eden. Obviously She had not thought about his love at all: The cataracts of her soul had poured themselves, And risen self-crowned in rainbow: would she ask Who crowned her?—it sufficed that she was crowned. With women of my class 'tis otherwise: We haggle for the small change of our gold, And so much love accord for so much love, Rialto-prices. Are we therefore wrong? If marriage be a contract, look to it then, Contracting parties should be equal, just; But if, a simple fealty on one side, A mere religion,—right to give, is all, And certain brides of Europe duly ask To mount the pile as Indian widows do, The spices of their tender youth heaped up, The jewels of their gracious virtues worn, More gems, more glory,—to consume entire For a living husband: as the man's alive, Not dead, the woman's duty by so much Advanced in England beyond Hindostan. I sat there musing, till she touched my hand With hers, as softly as a strange white bird She feared to startle in touching. “You are kind, But are you, peradventure, vexed at heart Because your cousin takes me for a wife? I know I am not worthy—nay, in truth, I'm glad on't, since, for that, he chooses me. He likes the poor things of the world the best; I would not therefore, if I could, be rich. It pleasures him to stoop for buttercups; I would not be a rose upon the wall A queen might stop at, near the palace-door, To say to a courtier ‘Pluck that rose for me, ‘It's prettier than the rest.’ O Romney Leigh! I'd rather far be trodden by his foot, Than lie in a great queen's bosom.” Out of breath, She paused. “Sweet Marian, do you disavow The roses with that face?” She dropped her head As if the wind had caught that flower of her And bent it in the garden,—then looked up With grave assurance. “Well, you think me bold! But so we all are, when we're praying God. And if I'm bold—yet, lady, credit me, That, since I know myself for what I am, Much fitter for his handmaid than his wife, I'll prove the handmaid and the wife at once, Serve tenderly, and love obediently, And be a worthier mate, perhaps, than some Who are wooed in silk among their learned books; While I shall set myself to read his eyes, Till such grow plainer to me than the French To wisest ladies. Do you think I'll miss A letter, in the spelling of his mind? No more than they do when they sit and write Their flying words with flickering wild-fowl tails, Nor ever pause to ask how many t's, Should that be y or i, they know't so well: I've seen them writing, when I brought a dress And waited,—floating out their soft white hands On shining paper. But they're hard, sometimes, For all those hands!—we've used out many nights, And worn the yellow daylight into shreds Which flapped and shivered down our aching eyes Till night appeared more tolerable, just That pretty ladies might look beautiful, Who said at last . . . ‘You're lazy in that house! ‘You're slow in sending home the work,—I count ‘I've waited near an hour for't.’ Pardon me, I do not blame them, madam, nor misprize; They are fair and gracious; ay, but not like you, Since none but you has Mister Leigh's own blood, Both noble and gentle,—and, without it . . . well, They are fair, I said; so fair, it scarce seems strange That, flashing out in any looking-glass The wonder of their glorious brows and breasts, They're charmed so, they forget to look behind And mark how pale we've grown, we pitiful Remainders of the world. And so perhaps If Mister Leigh had chosen a wife from these, She might, although he's better than her best And dearly she would know it, steal a thought Which should be all his, an eye-glance from his face, To plunge into the mirror opposite In search of her own beauty's pearl; while I . . . Ah, dearest lady, serge will outweigh silk For winter-wear when bodies feel a-cold, And I'll be a true wife to your cousin Leigh.” Before I answered he was there himself. I think he had been standing in the room And listened probably to half her talk, Arrested, turned to stone,—as white as stone. Will tender sayings make men look so white? He loves her then profoundly. “You are here, Aurora? Here I meet you!”—We clasped hands. “Even so, dear Romney. Lady Waldemar Has sent me in haste to find a cousin of mine Who shall be.” “Lady Waldemar is good.” “Here's one, at least, who is good,” I sighed, and touched Poor Marian's happy head, as doglike she, Most passionately patient, waited on, A-tremble for her turn of greeting words; “I've sat a full hour with your Marian Erle, And learnt the thing by heart,—and from my heart Am therefore competent to give you thanks For such a cousin.” “You accept at last A gift from me, Aurora, without scorn? At last I please you?”—How his voice was changed. “You cannot please a woman against her will, And once you vexed me. Shall we speak of that? We'll say, then, you were noble in it all, And I not ignorant—let it pass! And now You please me, Romney, when you please yourself; So, please you, be fanatical in love, And I'm well pleased. Ah, cousin! at the old hall, Among the gallery portraits of our Leighs, We shall not find a sweeter signory Than this pure forehead's.” Not a word he said. How arrogant men are!—Even philanthropists, Who try to take a wife up in the way They put down a subscription-cheque,—if once She turns and says “I will not tax you so, Most charitable sir,”—feel ill at ease As though she had wronged them somehow. I suppose We women should remember what we are, And not throw back an obolus inscribed With Cæsar's image, lightly. I resumed. “It strikes me, some of those sublime Vandykes Were not too proud to make good saints in heaven; And if so, then they're not too proud to-day, To bow down (now the ruffs are off their necks) And own this good, true, noble Marian, yours, And mine, I'll say!—For poets (bear the word), Half-poets even, are still whole democrats,— Oh, not that we're disloyal to the high, But loyal to the low, and cognisant Of the less scrutable majesties. For me, I comprehend your choice, I justify Your right in choosing.” “No, no, no,” he sighed, With a sort of melancholy, impatient scorn, As some grown man who never had a child Puts by some child who plays at being a man, “You did not, do not, cannot comprehend My choice, my ends, my motives, nor myself: No matter now; we'll let it pass, you say. I thank you for your generous cousinship Which helps this present; I accept for her Your favourable thoughts. We're fallen on days, We two who are not poets, when to wed Requires less mutual love than common love For two together to bear out at once Upon the loveless many. Work in pairs, In galley-couplings or in marriage-rings, The difference lies in the honour, not the work,— And such we're bound to, I and she. But love (You poets are benighted in this age, The hour's too late for catching even moths, You've gnats instead), love!—love's fool-paradise Is out of date, like Adam's. Set a swan To swim the Trenton, rather than true love To float its fabulous plumage safely down The cataracts of this loud transition-time,— Whose roar for ever henceforth in my ears Must keep me deaf to music.” There, I turned And kissed poor Marian, out of discontent. The man had baffled, chafed me, till I flung For refuge to the woman,—as, sometimes, Impatient of some crowded room's close smell, You throw a window open and lean out To breathe a long breath in the dewy night And cool your angry forehead. She, at least, Was not built up as walls are, brick by brick, Each fancy squared, each feeling ranged by line, The very heat of burning youth applied To indurate form and system! excellent bricks, A well-built wall,—which stops you on the road, And into which you cannot see an inch Although you beat your head against it—pshaw! “Adieu,” I said, “for this time, cousins both, And, cousin Romney, pardon me the word, Be happy!—oh, in some esoteric sense Of course!—I mean no harm in wishing well. Adieu, my Marian:—may she come to me, Dear Romney, and be married from my house? It is not part of your philosophy To keep your bird upon the blackthorn?” “Ay,” He answered, “but it is. I take my wife Directly from the people,—and she comes, As Austria's daughter to imperial France, Betwixt her eagles, blinking not her race, From Margaret's Court at garret-height, to meet And wed me at Saint James's, nor put off Her gown of serge for that. The things we do, We do: we'll wear no mask, as if we blushed.” “Dear Romney, you're the poet,” I replied, But felt my smile too mournful for my word, And turned and went. Ay, masks, I thought,—beware Of tragic masks we tie before the glass, Uplifted on the cothurn half a yard Above the natural stature! we would play Heroic parts to ourselves,—and end, perhaps, As impotently as Athenian wives Who shrieked in fits at the Eumenides. His foot pursued me down the stair. “At least You'll suffer me to walk with you beyond These hideous streets, these graves, where men alive Packed close with earthworms, burr unconsciously About the plague that slew them; let me go, The very women pelt their souls in mud At any woman who walks here alone. How came you here alone?—you are ignorant.” We had a strange and melancholy walk: The night came drizzling downward in dark rain, And, as we walked, the colour of the time, The act, the presence, my hand upon his arm, His voice in my ear, and mine to my own sense, Appeared unnatural. We talked modern books And daily papers, Spanish marriage-schemes And English climate—was't so cold last year? And will the wind change by to-morrow morn? Can Guizot stand? is London full? is trade Competitive? has Dickens turned his hinge A-pinch upon the fingers of the great? And are potatoes to grow mythical Like moly? will the apple die out too? Which way is the wind to-night? south-east? due east? We talked on fast, while every common word Seemed tangled with the thunder at one end, And ready to pull down upon our heads A terror out of sight. And yet to pause Were surelier mortal: we tore greedily up All silence, all the innocent breathing-points, As if, like pale conspirators in haste, We tore up papers where our signatures Imperilled us to an ugly shame or death. I cannot tell you why it was. 'Tis plain We had not loved nor hated: wherefore dread To spill gunpowder on ground safe from fire? Perhaps we had lived too closely, to diverge So absolutely: leave two clocks, they say, Wound up to different hours, upon one shelf, And slowly, through the interior wheels of each, The blind mechanic motion sets itself A-throb to feel out for the mutual time. It was not so with us, indeed: while he Struck midnight, I kept striking six at dawn; While he marked judgment, I, redemption-day; And such exception to a general law Imperious upon inert matter even, Might make us, each to either, insecure, A beckoning mystery or a troubling fear. I mind me, when we parted at the door, How strange his good-night sounded,—like good-night Beside a deathbed, where the morrow's sun Is sure to come too late for more good-days: And all that night I thought . . . “Goodnight,” said he. And so, a month passed. Let me set it down At once,—I have been wrong, I have been wrong. We are wrong always when we think too much Of what we think or are: albeit our thoughts Be verily bitter as self-sacrifice, We're no less selfish. If we sleep on rocks Or roses, sleeping past the hour of noon We're lazy. This I write against myself. I had done a duty in the visit paid To Marian, and was ready otherwise To give the witness of my presence and name Whenever she should marry.—Which, I thought, Sufficed. I even had cast into the scale An overweight of justice toward the match; The Lady Waldemar had missed her tool, Had broken it in the lock as being too straight For a crooked purpose, while poor Marian Erle Missed nothing in my accents or my acts: I had not been ungenerous on the whole, Nor yet untender; so, enough. I felt Tired, overworked: this marriage somewhat jarred; Or, if it did not, all the bridal noise, The pricking of the map of life with pins, In schemes of . . . “Here we'll go,” and “There we'll stay,” And “Everywhere we'll prosper in our love,” Was scarce my business: let them order it; Who else should care? I threw myself aside, As one who had done her work and shuts her eyes To rest the better. I, who should have known, Forereckoned mischief! Where we disavow Being keeper to our brother, we're his Cain. I might have held that poor child to my heart A little longer! 'twould have hurt me much To have hastened by its beats the marriage day, And kept her safe meantime from tampering hands Or, peradventure, traps. What drew me back From telling Romney plainly the designs Of Lady Waldemar, as spoken out To me . . . me? Had I any right, ay, right, With womanly compassion and reserve, To break the fall of woman's impudence?— To stand by calmly, knowing what I knew, And hear him call her good? Distrust that word. “There is none good save God,” said Jesus Christ. If He once, in the first creation-week, Called creatures good,—for ever, afterward, The Devil only has done it, and his heirs, The knaves who win so, and the fools who lose; The word's grown dangerous. In the middle age, I think they called malignant fays and imps Good people. A good neighbour, even in this, Is fatal sometimes,—cuts your morning up To mincemeat of the very smallest talk, Then helps to sugar her bohea at night With your reputation. I have known good wives, As chaste, or nearly so, as Potiphar's; And good, good mothers, who would use a child To better an intrigue; good friends, beside (Very good), who hung succinctly round your neck And sucked your breath, as cats are fabled to do By sleeping infants. And we all have known Good critics who have stamped out poet's hope, Good statesmen who pulled ruin on the state, Good patriots who for a theory risked a cause, Good kings who disembowelled for a tax, Good popes who brought all good to jeopardy, Good Christians who sat still in easy chairs And damned the general world for standing up.— Now may the good God pardon all good men! How bitterly I speak,—how certainly The innocent white milk in us is turned, By much persistent shining of the sun!— Shake up the sweetest in us long enough, With men, it drops to foolish curd, too sour To feed the most untender of Christ's lambs. I should have thought,—a woman of the world Like her I'm meaning, centre to herself, Who has wheeled on her own pivot half a life In isolated self-love and self-will, As a windmill seen at distance radiating Its delicate white vans against the sky, So soft and soundless, simply beautiful, Seen nearer,—what a roar and tear it makes, How it grinds and bruises!—if she loves at last, Her love's a re-adjustment of self-love, No more,—a need felt of another's use To her one advantage, as the mill wants grain, The fire wants fuel, the very wolf wants prey, And none of these is more unscrupulous Than such a charming woman when she loves. She'll not be thwarted by an obstacle So trifling as . . . her soul is, . . . much less yours!— Is God a consideration?—she loves you, Not God; she will not flinch for Him indeed: She did not for the Marchioness of Perth, When wanting tickets for the fancy ball. She loves you, sir, with passion, to lunacy; She loves you like her diamonds . . . almost. Well, A month passed so, and then the notice came, On such a day the marriage at the church. I was not backward. Half Saint Giles in frieze Was bidden to meet Saint James in cloth of gold, And, after contract at the altar, pass To eat a marriage-feast on Hampstead Heath. Of course the people came in uncompelled, Lame, blind, and worse—sick, sorrowful, and worse— The humours of the peccant social wound All pressed out, poured down upon Pimlico, Exasperating the unaccustomed air With a hideous interfusion. You'd suppose A finished generation, dead of plague, Swept outward from their graves into the sun, The moil of death upon them. What a sight! A holiday of miserable men Is sadder than a burial-day of kings. They clogged the streets, they oozed into the church In a dark slow stream, like blood. To see that sight, The noble ladies stood up in their pews, Some pale for fear, a few as red for hate, Some simply curious, some just insolent, And some in wondering scorn,—“What next? what next?” These crushed their delicate rose-lips from the smile That misbecame them in a holy place, With broidered hems of perfumed handkerchiefs; Those passed the salts, with confidence of eyes And simultaneous shiver of moiré silk: While all the aisles, alive and black with heads, Crawled slowly toward the altar from the street, As bruised snakes crawl and hiss out of a hole With shuddering involution, swaying slow From right to left, and then from left to right, In pants and pauses. What an ugly crest Of faces rose upon you everywhere From that crammed mass! you did not usually See faces like them in the open day: They hide in cellars, not to make you mad As Romney Leigh is.—Faces!—O my God, We call those, faces? men's and women's . . . ay, And children's;—babies, hanging like a rag Forgotten on their mother's neck,—poor mouths, Wiped clean of mother's milk by mother's blow Before they are taught her cursing. Faces? . . . phew, We'll call them vices, festering to despairs, Or sorrows, petrifying to vices: not A finger-touch of God left whole on them, All ruined, lost—the countenance worn out As the garment, the will dissolute as the act, The passions loose and draggling in the dirt To trip a foot up at the first free step! Those, faces? 'twas as if you had stirred up hell To heave its lowest dreg-fiends uppermost In fiery swirls of slime,—such strangled fronts, Such obdurate jaws were thrown up constantly To twit you with your race, corrupt your blood, And grind to devilish colours all your dreams Henceforth,—though, haply, you should drop asleep By clink of silver waters, in a muse On Raffael's mild Madonna of the Bird. I've waked and slept through many nights and days Since then,—but still that day will catch my breath Like a nightmare. There are fatal days, indeed, In which the fibrous years have taken root So deeply, that they quiver to their tops Whene'er you stir the dust of such a day. My cousin met me with his eyes and hand, And then, with just a word, . . . that “Marian Erle Was coming with her bridesmaids presently,” Made haste to place me by the altar-stair Where he and other noble gentlemen And high-born ladies waited for the bride. We waited. It was early: there was time For greeting and the morning's compliment, And gradually a ripple of women's talk Arose and fell and tossed about a spray Of English s's, soft as a silent hush, And, notwithstanding, quite as audible As louder phrases thrown out by the men. —“Yes, really, if we need to wait in church, We need to talk there.”—“She? 'tis Lady Ayr, In blue—not purple! that's the dowager.” —“She looks as young”—“She flirts as young, you mean. Why, if you had seen her upon Thursday night, You'd call Miss Norris modest.”—“You again! I waltzed with you three hours back. Up at six, Up still at ten; scarce time to change one's shoes: I feel as white and sulky as a ghost, So pray don't speak to me, Lord Belcher.”—“No, I'll look at you instead, and it's enough While you have that face.” “In church, my lord! fie, fie!” —“Adair, you stayed for the Division?”—“Lost By one.” “The devil it is! I'm sorry for't. And if I had not promised Mistress Grove” . . . “You might have kept your word to Liverpool.” —“Constituents must remember, after all, We're mortal.”—“We remind them of it.”—“Hark, The bride comes! here she comes, in a stream of milk!” —“There? Dear, you are asleep still; don't you know The five Miss Granvilles? always dressed in white To show they're ready to be married.”—“Lower! The aunt is at your elbow.”—“Lady Maud, Did Lady Waldemar tell you she had seen This girl of Leigh's?” “No,—wait! 'twas Mistress Brookes, Who told me Lady Waldemar told her— No, 'twasn't Mistress Brookes.”—“She's pretty?”—“Who? Mistress Brookes? Lady Waldemar?”—“How hot! Pray is't the law to-day we're not to breathe? You're treading on my shawl—I thank you, sir.” —“They say the bride's a mere child, who can't read, But knows the things she shouldn't, with wide-awake Great eyes. I'd go through fire to look at her.” —“You do, I think.”—“And Lady Waldemar (You see her; sitting close to Romney Leigh. How beautiful she looks, a little flushed!) Has taken up the girl, and methodised Leigh's folly. Should I have come here, you suppose, Except she'd asked me?”—“She'd have served him more By marrying him herself.” “Ah—there she comes, The bride, at last!” “Indeed, no. Past eleven. She puts off her patched petticoat to-day And puts on Mayfair manners, so begins By setting us to wait.”—“Yes, yes, this Leigh Was always odd; it's in the blood, I think; His father's uncle's cousin's second son Was, was . . . you understand me; and for him, He's stark,—has turned quite lunatic upon This modern question of the poor—the poor. An excellent subject when you're moderate; You've seen Prince Albert's model lodging-house? Does honour to his Royal Highness. Good! But would he stop his carriage in Cheapside To shake a common fellow by the fist Whose name was . . . Shakespeare? No. We draw a line, And if we stand not by our order, we In England, we fall headlong. Here's a sight,— A hideous sight, a most indecent sight! My wife would come, sir, or I had kept her back. By heaven, sir, when poor Damiens' trunk and limbs Were torn by horses, women of the court Stood by and stared, exactly as to-day On this dismembering of society, With pretty, troubled faces.” “Now, at last. She comes now.” “Where? who sees? you push me, sir, Beyond the point of what is mannerly. You're standing, madam, on my second flounce. I do beseech you . . .” “No—it's not the bride. Half-past eleven. How late. The bride-groom, mark, Gets anxious and goes out.” “And as I said, These Leighs! our best blood running in the rut! It's something awful. We had pardoned him A simple misalliance got up aside For a pair of sky-blue eyes; the House of Lords Has winked at such things, and we've all been young; But here's an intermarriage reasoned out, A contract (carried boldly to the light To challenge observation, pioneer Good acts by a great example) 'twixt the extremes Of martyrised society,—on the left The well-born, on the right the merest mob, To treat as equals!—'tis anarchical; It means more than it says; 'tis damnable Why, sir, we can't have even our coffee good, Unless we strain it.” “Here, Miss Leigh!” “Lord Howe, You're Romney's friend. What's all this waiting for?” “I cannot tell. The bride has lost her head (And way, perhaps!) to prove her sympathy With the bridegroom.” “What,—you also, disapprove!” “Oh, I approve of nothing in the world,” He answered, “not of you, still less of me, Nor even of Romney, though he's worth us both. We're all gone wrong. The tune in us is lost; And whistling down back alleys to the moon Will never catch it.” Let me draw Lord Howe. A born aristocrat, bred radical, And educated socialist, who still Goes floating, on traditions of his kind, Across the theoretic flood from France, Though, like a drenched Noah on a rotten deck, Scarce safer for his place there. He, at least, Will never land on Ararat, he knows, To recommence the world on the new plan: Indeed, he thinks, said world had better end. He sympathises rather with the fish Outside, than with the drowned paired beasts within Who cannot couple again or multiply,— And that's the sort of Noah he is, Lord Howe. He never could be anything complete, Except a loyal, upright gentleman, A liberal landlord, graceful diner-out, And entertainer more than hospitable, Whom authors dine with and forget the hock. Whatever he believes, and it is much, But nowise certain, now here and now there, He still has sympathies beyond his creed Diverting him from action. In the House, No party counts upon him, while for all His speeches have a noticeable weight. Men like his books too (he has written books), Which, safe to lie beside a bishop's chair, At times outreach themselves with jets of fire At which the foremost of the progressists May warm audacious hands in passing by. Of stature over-tall, lounging for ease; Light hair, that seems to carry a wind in it, And eyes that, when they look on you, will lean Their whole weight, half in indolence and half In wishing you unmitigated good, Until you know not if to flinch from him Or thank him.—'Tis Lord Howe. “We're all gone wrong,” Said he; “and Romney, that dear friend of ours, Is nowise right. There's one true thing on earth, That's love! he takes it up, and dresses it, And acts a play with it, as Hamlet did, To show what cruel uncles we have been, And how we should be uneasy in our minds While he, Prince Hamlet, weds a pretty maid (Who keeps us too long waiting, we'll confess) By symbol, to instruct us formally To fill the ditches up 'twixt class and class, And live together in phalansteries. What then?—he's mad, our Hamlet! clap his play, And bind him.” “Ah, Lord Howe, this spectacle Pulls stronger at us than the Dane's. See there! The crammed aisles heave and strain and steam with life. Dear heaven, what life!” “Why, yes,—a poet sees; Which makes him different from a common man. I, too, see somewhat, though I cannot sing; I should have been a poet, only that My mother took fright at the ugly world, And bore me tongue-tied. If you'll grant me now That Romney gives us a fine actor-piece To make us merry on his marriage-morn, The fable's worse than Hamlet's I'll concede. The terrible people, old and poor and blind, Their eyes eat out with plague and poverty From seeing beautiful and cheerful sights, We'll liken to a brutalised King Lear, Led out,—by no means to clear scores with wrongs— His wrongs are so far back, he has forgot (All's past like youth); but just to witness here A simple contract,—he, upon his side, And Regan with her sister Goneril And all the dappled courtiers and courtfools On their side. Not that any of these would say They're sorry, neither. What is done, is done, And violence is now turned privilege, As cream turns cheese, if buried long enough. What could such lovely ladies have to do With the old man there, in those ill-odorous rags, Except to keep the wind-side of him? Lear Is flat and quiet, as a decent grave; He does not curse his daughters in the least: Be these his daughters? Lear is thinking of His porridge chiefly . . . is it getting cold At Hampstead? will the ale be served in pots? Poor Lear, poor daughters! Bravo, Romney's play!” A murmur and a movement drew around, A naked whisper touched us. Something wrong. What's wrong? The black crowd, as an overstrained Cord, quivered in vibration, and I saw . . . Was that his face I saw? . . . his . . . Romney Leigh's . . . Which tossed a sudden horror like a sponge Into all eyes,—while himself stood white upon The topmost altar-stair and tried to speak, And failed, and lifted higher above his head A letter, . . . as a man who drowns and gasps. “My brothers, bear with me! I am very weak. I meant but only good. Perhaps I meant Too proudly, and God snatched the circumstance And changed it therefore. There's no marriage—none. She leaves me,—she departs,—she disappears,— I lose her. Yet I never forced her ‘ay,’ To have her ‘no’ so cast into my teeth In manner of an accusation, thus. My friends, you are dismissed. Go, eat and drink According to the programme,—and farewell!” He ended. There was silence in the church. We heard a baby sucking in its sleep At the farthest end of the aisle. Then spoke a man: “Now, look to it, coves, that all the beef and drink Be not filched from us like the other fun, For beer's spilt easier than a woman's lost! This gentry is not honest with the poor; They bring us up, to trick us.”—“Go it, Jim,” A woman screamed back,—“I'm a tender soul, I never banged a child at two years old And drew blood from him, but I sobbed for it Next moment,—and I've had a plague of seven. I'm tender; I've no stomach even for beef, Until I know about the girl that's lost, That's killed, mayhap. I did misdoubt, at first, The fine lord meant no good by her or us. He, maybe, got the upper hand of her By holding up a wedding-ring, and then . . . A choking finger on her throat last night, And just a clever tale to keep us still, As she is, poor lost innocent. ‘Disappear!’ Who ever disappears except a ghost? And who believes a story of a ghost? I ask you,—would a girl go off, instead Of staying to be married? a fine tale! A wicked man, I say, a wicked man! For my part, I would rather starve on gin Than make my dinner on his beef and beer.”— At which a cry rose up—“We'll have our rights. We'll have the girl, the girl! Your ladies there Are married safely and smoothly every day, And she shall not drop through into a trap Because she's poor and of the people: shame We'll have no tricks played off by gentlefolk; We'll see her righted.” Through the rage and roar I heard the broken words which Romney flung Among the turbulent masses, from the ground He held still with his masterful pale face,— As huntsmen throw the ration to the pack, Who, falling on it headlong, dog on dog In heaps of fury, rend it, swallow it up With yelling hound-jaws,—his indignant words, His suppliant words, his most pathetic words, Whereof I caught the meaning here and there By his gesture . . . torn in morsels, yelled across, And so devoured. From end to end, the church Rocked round us like the sea in storm, and then Broke up like the earth in earthquake. Men cried out “Police”—and women stood and shrieked for God, Or dropped and swooned; or, like a herd of deer (For whom the black woods suddenly grow alive, Unleashing their wild shadows down the wind To hunt the creatures into corners, back And forward), madly fled, or blindly fell, Trod screeching underneath the feet of those Who fled and screeched. The last sight left to me Was Romney's terrible calm face above The tumult!—the last sound was “Pull him down! Strike—kill him!” Stretching my unreasoning arms, As men in dreams, who vainly interpose 'Twixt gods and their undoing, with a cry I struggled to precipitate myself Head-foremost to the rescue of my soul In that white face, . . . till some one caught me back, And so the world went out,—I felt no more. What followed was told after by Lord Howe, Who bore me senseless from the strangling crowd In church and street, and then returned alone To see the tumult quelled. The men of law Had fallen as thunder on a roaring fire, And made all silent,—while the people's smoke Passed eddying slowly from the emptied aisles. Here's Marian's letter, which a ragged child Brought running, just as Romney at the porch Looked out expectant of the bride. He sent The letter to me by his friend Lord Howe Some two hours after, folded in a sheet On which his well-known hand had left a word. Here's Marian's letter. “Noble friend, dear saint, Be patient with me. Never think me vile Who might to-morrow morning be your wife But that I loved you more than such a name. Farewell, my Romney. Let me write it once,— My Romney. “'Tis so pretty a coupled word, I have no heart to pluck it with a blot. We say ‘my God’ sometimes, upon our knees, Who is not therefore vexed: so bear with it . . . And me. I know I'm foolish, weak, and vain: Yet most of all I'm angry with myself For losing your last footstep on the stair That last time of your coming,—yesterday! The very first time I lost step of yours (Its sweetness comes the next to what you speak), But yesterday sobs took me by the throat And cut me off from music. “Mister Leigh, You'll set me down as wrong in many things. You've praised me, sir, for truth,—and now you'll learn I had not courage to be rightly true. I once began to tell you how she came, The woman . . . and you stared upon the floor In one of your fixed thoughts . . . which put me out For that day. After, some one spoke of me, So wisely, and of you, so tenderly, Persuading me to silence for your sake . . . Well, well! it seems this moment I was wrong In keeping back from telling you the truth: There might be truth betwixt us two, at least, If nothing else. And yet 'twas dangerous. Suppose a real angel came from heaven To live with men and women! he'd go mad, If no considerate hand should tie a blind Across his piercing eyes. 'Tis thus with you: You see us too much in your heavenly light; I always thought so, angel,—and indeed There's danger that you beat yourself to death Against the edges of this alien world, In some divine and fluttering pity. “Yes, It would be dreadful for a friend of yours, To see all England thrust you out of doors And mock you from the windows. You might say, Or think (that's worse) ‘There's some one in the house I miss and love still.’ Dreadful! “Very kind, I pray you mark, was Lady Waldemar. She came to see me nine times, rather ten— So beautiful, she hurts one like the day Let suddenly on sick eyes. “Most kind of all, Your cousin!—ah, most like you! Ere you came She kissed me mouth to mouth: I felt her soul Dip through her serious lips in holy fire. God help me, but it made me arrogant; I almost told her that you would not lose By taking me to wife: though ever since I've pondered much a certain thing she asked . . . ‘He loves you, Marian?’ . . . in a sort of mild Derisive sadness . . . as a mother asks Her babe, ‘You'll touch that star, you think?’ “Farewell! I know I never touched it. “This is worst: Babes grow and lose the hope of things above; A silver threepence sets them leaping high— But no more stars! mark that. “I've writ all night Yet told you nothing. God, if I could die, And let this letter break off innocent Just here! But no—for your sake. “Here's the last: I never could be happy as your wife, I never could be harmless as your friend, I never will look more into your face Till God says ‘Look!’ I charge you, seek me not, Nor vex yourself with lamentable thoughts That peradventure I have come to grief; Be sure I'm well, I'm merry, I'm at ease, But such a long way, long way, long way off, I think you'll find me sooner in my grave, And that's my choice, observe. For what remains, An over-generous friend will care for me And keep me happy . . . happier . . . “There's a blot! This ink runs thick . . . we light girls lightly weep . . . And keep me happier . . . was the thing to say, Than as your wife I could be.—O, my star, My saint, my soul! for surely you're my soul, Through whom God touched me! I am not so lost I cannot thank you for the good you did, The tears you stopped, which fell down bitterly, Like these—the times you made me weep for joy At hoping I should learn to write your notes And save the tiring of your eyes, at night; And most for that sweet thrice you kissed my lips Saying ‘Dear Marian.’ “'Twould be hard to read, This letter, for a reader half as learn'd; But you'll be sure to master it in spite Of ups and downs. My hand shakes, I am blind; I'm poor at writing at the best,—and yet I tried to make my g's the way you showed. Farewell. Christ love you.—Say ‘poor Marian’ now.” Poor Marian!—wanton Marian!—was it so, Or so? For days, her touching, foolish lines We mused on with conjectural fantasy, As if some riddle of a summer-cloud On which one tries unlike similitudes Of now a spotted Hydra-skin cast off, And now a screen of carven ivory That shuts the heavens' conventual secrets up From mortals overbold. We sought the sense: She loved him so perhaps (such words mean love), That, worked on by some shrewd perfidious tongue (And then I thought of Lady Waldemar), She left him, not to hurt him; or perhaps She loved one in her class,—or did not love, But mused upon her wild bad tramping life Until the free blood fluttered at her heart, And black bread eaten by the roadside hedge Seemed sweeter than being put to Romney's school Of philanthropical self-sacrifice Irrevocably.—Girls are girls, beside, Thought I, and like a wedding by one rule. You seldom catch these birds except with chaff: They feel it almost an immoral thing To go out and be married in broad day, Unless some winning special flattery should Excuse them to themselves for't, . . . “No one parts Her hair with such a silver line as you, One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown!” Or else . . . “You bite your lip in such a way It spoils me for the smiling of the rest,” And so on. Then a worthless gaud or two To keep for love,—a ribbon for the neck, Or some glass pin,—they have their weight with girls. And Romney sought her many days and weeks: He sifted all the refuse of the town, Explored the trains, inquired among the ships, And felt the country through from end to end; No Marian!—Though I hinted what I knew,— A friend of his had reasons of her own For throwing back the match—he would not hear: The lady had been ailing ever since, The shock had harmed her. Something in his tone Repressed me; something in me shamed my doubt To a sigh repressed too. He went on to say That, putting questions where his Marian lodged, He found she had received for visitors, Besides himself and Lady Waldemar And, that once, me—a dubious woman dressed Beyond us both: the rings upon her hands Had dazed the children when she threw them pence; “She wore her bonnet as the queen might hers, To show the crown,” they said,—“a scarlet crown Of roses that had never been in bud.” When Romney told me that,—for now and then He came to tell me how the search advanced, His voice dropped: I bent forward for the rest: The woman had been with her, it appeared, At first from week to week, then day by day, And last, 'twas sure . . . I looked upon the ground To escape the anguish of his eyes, and asked As low as when you speak to mourners new Of those they cannot bear yet to call dead, “If Marian had as much as named to him A certain Rose, an early friend of hers, A ruined creature.” “Never.”—Starting up He strode from side to side about the room, Most like some prisoned lion sprung awake, Who has felt the desert sting him through his dreams. “What was I to her, that she should tell me aught? A friend! was I a friend? I see all clear. Such devils would pull angels out of heaven, Provided they could reach them; 'tis their pride; And that's the odds 'twixt soul and body plague! The veriest slave who drops in Cairo's street Cries ‘Stand off from me’ to the passengers; While these blotched souls are eager to infect, And blow their bad breath in a sister's face As if they got some ease by it.” I broke through. “Some natures catch no plagues. I've read of babes Found whole and sleeping by the spotted breast Of one a full day dead. I hold it true, As I'm a woman and know womanhood, That Marian Erle, however lured from place, Deceived in way, keeps pure in aim and heart As snow that's drifted from the garden-bank To the open road.” 'Twas hard to hear him laugh. “The figure's happy. Well—a dozen carts And trampers will secure you presently A fine white snow-drift. Leave it there, your snow: 'Twill pass for soot ere sunset. Pure in aim? She's pure in aim, I grant you,—like myself, Who thought to take the world upon my back To carry it o'er a chasm of social ill, And end by letting slip through impotence A single soul, a child's weight in a soul, Straight down the pit of hell! yes, I and she Have reason to be proud of our pure aims.” Then softly, as the last repenting drops Of a thunder-shower, he added, “The poor child, Poor Marian! 'twas a luckless day for her When first she chanced on my philanthropy.” He drew a chair beside me, and sat down; And I, instinctively, as women use Before a sweet friend's grief,—when, in his ear, They hum the tune of comfort though themselves Most ignorant of the special words of such, And quiet so and fortify his brain And give it time and strength for feeling out To reach the availing sense beyond that sound,— Went murmuring to him what, if written here, Would seem not much, yet fetched him better help Than peradventure if it had been more. I've known the pregnant thinkers of our time, And stood by breathless, hanging on their lips, When some chromatic sequence of fine thought In learned modulation phrased itself To an unconjectured harmony of truth: And yet I've been more moved, more raised, I say, By a simple word . . . a broken easy thing A three-years' infant might at need repeat, A look, a sigh, a touch upon the palm, Which meant less than “I love you,” than by all The full-voiced rhetoric of those master-mouths. “Ah, dear Aurora,” he began at last, His pale lips fumbling for a sort of smile, “Your printer's devils have not spoilt your heart: That's well. And who knows but, long years ago When you and I talked, you were somewhat right In being so peevish with me? You, at least, Have ruined no one through your dreams. Instead, You've helped the facile youth to live youth's day With innocent distraction, still perhaps Suggestive of things better than your rhymes. The little shepherd-maiden, eight years old, I've seen upon the mountains of Vaucluse, Asleep i' the sun, her head upon her knees, The flocks all scattered,—is more laudable Than any sheep-dog, trained imperfectly, Who bites the kids through too much zeal.” “I look As if I had slept, then?” He was touched at once By something in my face. Indeed 'twas sure That he and I,—despite a year or two Of younger life on my side, and on his The heaping of the years' work on the days, The three-hour speeches from the member's seat, The hot committees in and out of doors, The pamphlets, “Arguments,” “Collective Views,” Tossed out as straw before sick houses, just To show one's sick and so be trod to dirt And no more use,—through this world's underground, The burrowing, groping effort, whence the arm And heart come torn,—'twas sure that he and I Were, after all, unequally fatigued; That he, in his developed manhood, stood A little sunburnt by the glare of life, While I . . . it seemed no sun had shone on me, So many seasons I had missed my Springs. My cheeks had pined and perished from their orbs, And all the youth-blood in them had grown white As dew on autumn cyclamens: alone My eyes and forehead answered for my face. He said, “Aurora, you are changed—are ill!” “Not so, my cousin,—only not asleep,” I answered, smiling gently. “Let it be. You scarcely found the poet of Vaucluse As drowsy as the shepherds. What is art But life upon the larger scale, the higher, When, graduating up in a spiral line Of still expanding and ascending gyres, It pushes toward the intense significance Of all things, hungry for the Infinite? Art's life,—and where we live, we suffer and toil.” He seemed to sift me with his painful eyes. “You take it gravely, cousin; you refuse Your dreamland's right of common, and green rest. You break the mythic turf where danced the nymphs, With crooked ploughs of actual life,—let in The axes to the legendary woods, To pay the poll-tax. You are fallen indeed On evil days, you poets, if yourselves Can praise that art of yours no otherwise; And, if you cannot, . . . better take a trade And be of use: 'twere cheaper for your youth.” “Of use!” I softly echoed, “there's the point We sweep about for ever in argument, Like swallows which the exasperate, dying year Sets spinning in black circles, round and round, Preparing for far flights o'er unknown seas. And we, where tend we?” “Where?” he said, and sighed. “The whole creation, from the hour we are born, Perplexes us with questions. Not a stone But cries behind us, every weary step, ‘Where, where?’ I leave stones to reply to stones. Enough for me and for my fleshly heart To hearken the invocations of my kind, When men catch hold upon my shuddering nerves And shriek ‘What help? what hope? what bread i' the house, ‘What fire i' the frost?’ There must be some response, Though mine fail utterly. This social Sphinx Who sits between the sepulchres and stews, Makes mock and mow against the crystal heavens, And bullies God,—exacts a word at least From each man standing on the side of God, However paying a sphinx-price for it. We pay it also if we hold our peace, In pangs and pity. Let me speak and die. Alas, you'll say I speak and kill instead.” I pressed in there. “The best men, doing their best, Know peradventure least of what they do: Men usefullest i' the world are simply used; The nail that holds the wood must pierce it first, And He alone who wields the hammer sees The work advanced by the earliest blow. Take heart.” “Ah, if I could have taken yours!” he said, “But that's past now.” Then rising,—“I will take At least your kindness and encouragement. I thank you. Dear, be happy. Sing your songs, If that's your way! but sometimes slumber too, Nor tire too much with following, out of breath, The rhymes upon your mountains of Delight. Reflect, if Art be in truth the higher life, You need the lower life to stand upon In order to reach up unto that higher; And none can stand a-tip toe in the place He cannot stand in with two stable feet. Remember then!—for Art's sake, hold your life.” We parted so. I held him in respect. I comprehended what he was in heart And sacrificial greatness. Ay, but he Supposed me a thing too small, to deign to know: He blew me, plainly, from the crucible As some intruding, interrupting fly, Not worth the pains of his analysis Absorbed on nobler subjects. Hurt a fly! He would not for the world: he's pitiful To flies even. “Sing,” says he, “and tease me still, If that's your way, poor insect.” That's your way! FIFTH BOOK. Aurora Leigh, be humble. Shall I hope To speak my poems in mysterious tune With man and nature?—with the lava-lymph That trickles from successive galaxies Still drop by drop adown the finger of God In still new worlds?—with summer-days in this That scarce dare breathe they are so beautiful? With spring's delicious trouble in the ground, Tormented by the quickened blood of roots, And softly pricked by golden crocus-sheaves In token of the harvest-time of flowers? With winters and with autumns,—and beyond With the human heart's large seasons, when it hopes And fears, joys, grieves, and loves?—with all that strain Of sexual passion, which devours the flesh In a sacrament of souls? with mother's breasts Which, round the new-made creatures hanging there, Throb luminous and harmonious like pure spheres?— With multitudinous life, and finally With the great escapings of ecstatic souls, Who, in a rush of too long prisoned flame, Their radiant faces upward, burn away This dark of the body, issuing on a world Beyond our mortal?—can I speak my verse So plainly in tune to these things and the rest That men shall feel it catch them on the quick As having the same warrant over them To hold and move them if they will or no, Alike imperious as the primal rhythm Of that theurgic nature?—I must fail, Who fail at the beginning to hold and move One man,—and he my cousin, and he my friend, And he born tender, made intelligent, Inclined to ponder the precipitous sides Of difficult questions; yet, obtuse to me, Of me, incurious! likes me very well, And wishes me a paradise of good, Good looks, good means, and good digestion,—ay, But otherwise evades me, puts me off With kindness, with a tolerant gentleness,— Too light a book for a grave man's reading! Go, Aurora Leigh: be humble. There it is, We women are too apt to look to one, Which proves a certain impotence in art. We strain our natures at doing something great, Far less because it's something great to do, Than haply that we, so, commend ourselves As being not small, and more appreciable To some one friend. We must have mediators Betwixt our highest conscience and the judge; Some sweet saint's blood must quicken in our palms, Or all the life in heaven seems slow and cold: Good only being perceived as the end of good, And God alone pleased,—that's too poor, we think, And not enough for us by any means. Ay—Romney, I remember, told me once We miss the abstract when we comprehend. We miss it most when we aspire,—and fail. Yet, so, I will not.—This vile woman's way Of trailing garments shall not trip me up: I'll have no traffic with the personal thought In Art's pure temple. Must I work in vain, Without the approbation of a man? It cannot be; it shall not. Fame itself, That approbation of the general race, Presents a poor end (though the arrow speed Shot straight with vigorous finger to the white), And the highest fame was never reached except By what was aimed above it. Art for art, And good for God Himself, the essential Good! We'll keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect, Although our woman-hands should shake and fail; And if we fail . . . But must we?— Shall I fail? The Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase, “Let no one be called happy till his death.” To which I add,—Let no one till his death Be called unhappy. Measure not the work Until the day's out and the labour done, Then bring your gauges. If the day's work's scant, Why, call it scant; affect no compromise; And, in that we have nobly striven at least, Deal with us nobly, women though we be, And honour us with truth if not with praise. My ballads prospered; but the ballad's race Is rapid for a poet who bears weights Of thought and golden image. He can stand Like Atlas, in the sonnet,—and support His own heavens pregnant with dynastic stars; But then he must stand still, nor take a step. In that descriptive poem called “The Hills,” The prospects were too far and indistinct. 'Tis true my critics said “A fine view, that!” The public scarcely cared to climb my book For even the finest, and the public's right; A tree's mere firewood, unless humanised,— Which well the Greeks knew when they stirred its bark With close-pressed bosoms of subsiding nymphs, And made the forest-rivers garrulous With babble of gods. For us, we are called to mark A still more intimate humanity In this inferior nature, or ourselves Must fall like dead leaves trodden underfoot By veritable artists. Earth (shut up By Adam, like a fakir in a box Left too long buried) remained stiff and dry, A mere dumb corpse, till Christ the Lord came down, Unlocked the doors, forced open the blank eyes, And used His kingly chrism to straighten out The leathery tongue turned back into the throat; Since when, she lives, remembers, palpitates In every limb, aspires in every breath, Embraces infinite relations. Now We want no half-gods, Panomphæan Joves, Fauns, Naiads, Tritons, Oreads and the rest, To take possession of a senseless world To unnatural vampire-uses. See the earth, The body of our body, the green earth, Indubitably human like this flesh And these articulated veins through which Our heart drives blood. There's not a flower of spring That dies ere June but vaunts itself allied By issue and symbol, by significance And correspondence, to that spirit-world Outside the limits of our space and time, Whereto we are bound. Let poets give it voice With human meanings,—else they miss the thought, And henceforth step down lower, stand confessed Instructed poorly for interpreters, Thrown out by an easy cowslip in the text. Even so my pastoral failed: it was a book Of surface-pictures—pretty, cold, and false With literal transcript,—the worse done, I think, For being not ill-done: let me set my mark Against such doings, and do otherwise. This strikes me.—If the public whom we know Could catch me at such admissions, I should pass For being right modest. Yet how proud we are, In daring to look down upon ourselves! The critics say that epics have died out With Agamemnon and the goat-nursed gods; I'll not believe it. I could never deem, As Payne Knight did (the mythic mountaineer Who travelled higher than he was born to live, And showed sometimes the goitre in his throat Discoursing of an image seen through fog), That Homer's heroes measured twelve feet high. They were but men:—his Helen's hair turned grey Like any plain Miss Smith's who wears a front; And Hector's infant whimpered at a plume As yours last Friday at a turkey-cock. All actual heroes are essential men, And all men possible heroes: every age, Heroic in proportions, double-faced, Looks backward and before, expects a morn And claims an epos. Ay, but every age Appears to souls who live in't (ask Carlyle) Most unheroic. Ours, for instance, ours: The thinkers scout it, and the poets abound Who scorn to touch it with a finger-tip: A pewter age,—mixed metal, silver-washed; An age of scum, spooned off the richer past, An age of patches for old gaberdines, An age of mere transition, meaning nought Except that what succeeds must shame it quite If God please. That's wrong thinking, to my mind, And wrong thoughts make poor poems. Every age, Through being beheld too close, is ill-discerned By those who have not lived past it. We'll suppose Mount Athos carved, as Alexander schemed, To some colossal statue of a man. The peasants, gathering brushwood in his ear, Had guessed as little as the browsing goats Of form or feature of humanity Up there,—in fact, had travelled five miles off Or ere the giant image broke on them, Full human profile, nose and chin distinct, Mouth, muttering rhythms of silence up the sky And fed at evening with the blood of suns; Grand torso,—hand, that flung perpetually The largesse of a silver river down To all the country pastures. 'Tis even thus With times we live in,—evermore too great To be apprehended near. But poets should Exert a double vision; should have eyes To see near things as comprehensively As if afar they took their point of sight, And distant things as intimately deep As if they touched them. Let us strive for this. I do distrust the poet who discerns No character or glory in his times, And trundles back his soul five hundred years, Past moat and drawbridge, into a castle-court, To sing—oh, not of lizard or of toad Alive i' the ditch there,—'twere excusable, But of some black chief, half knight, half sheep-lifter, Some beauteous dame, half chattel and half queen, As dead as must be, for the greater part, The poems made on their chivalric bones; And that's no wonder: death inherits death. Nay, if there's room for poets in this world A little overgrown (I think there is), Their sole work is to represent the age, Their age, not Charlemagne's,—this live, throbbing age, That brawls, cheats, maddens, calculates, aspires, And spends more passion, more heroic heat, Betwixt the mirrors of its drawing-rooms, Than Roland with his knights at Roncesvalles. To flinch from modern varnish, coat or flounce, Cry out for togas and the picturesque, Is fatal,—foolish too. King Arthur's self Was commonplace to Lady Guenever; And Camelot to minstrels seemed as flat As Fleet Street to our poets. Never flinch, But still, unscrupulously epic, catch Upon the burning lava of a song The full-veined, heaving, double-breasted Age: That, when the next shall come, the men of that May touch the impress with reverent hand, and say “Behold,—behold the paps we all have sucked! This bosom seems to beat still, or at least It sets ours beating: this is living art, Which thus presents and thus records true life.” What form is best for poems? Let me think Of forms less, and the external. Trust the spirit, As sovran nature does, to make the form; For otherwise we only imprison spirit And not embody. Inward evermore To outward,—so in life, and so in art Which still is life. Five acts to make a play. And why not fifteen? why not ten? or seven? What matter for the number of the leaves, Supposing the tree lives and grows? exact The literal unities of time and place, When 'tis the essence of passion to ignore Both time and place? Absurd. Keep up the fire, And leave the generous flames to shape themselves. 'Tis true the stage requires obsequiousness To this or that convention; “exit” here And “enter” there; the points for clapping, fixed, Like Jacob's white-peeled rods before the rams, And all the close-curled imagery clipped In manner of their fleece at shearing-time. Forget to prick the galleries to the heart Precisely at the fourth act,—culminate Our five pyramidal acts with one act more,— We're lost so: Shakespeare's ghost could scarcely plead Against our just damnation. Stand aside; We'll muse for comfort that, last century, On this same tragic stage on which we have failed, A wigless Hamlet would have failed the same. And whosoever writes good poetry, Looks just to art. He does not write for you Or me,—for London or for Edinburgh; He will not suffer the best critic known To step into his sunshine of free thought And self-absorbed conception and exact An inch-long swerving of the holy lines. If virtue done for popularity Defiles like vice, can art, for praise or hire, Still keep its splendour and remain pure art? Eschew such serfdom. What the poet writes, He writes: mankind accepts it if it suits, And that's success: if not, the poem's passed From hand to hand, and yet from hand to hand Until the unborn snatch it, crying out In pity on their fathers' being so dull, And that's success too. I will write no plays; Because the drama, less sublime in this, Makes lower appeals, submits more menially, Adopts the standard of the public taste To chalk its height on, wears a dog-chain round Its regal neck, and learns to carry and fetch The fashions of the day to please the day, Fawns close on pit and boxes, who clap hands Commending chiefly its docility And humour in stage-tricks,—or else indeed Gets hissed at, howled at, stamped at like a dog, Or worse, we'll say. For dogs, unjustly kicked, Yell, bite at need; but if your dramatist (Being wronged by some five hundred nobodies Because their grosser brains most naturally Misjudge the fineness of his subtle wit) Shows teeth an almond's breadth, protests the length Of a modest phrase,—“My gentle countrymen, “There's something in it haply of your fault,”— Why then, besides five hundred nobodies, He'll have five thousand and five thousand more Against him,—the whole public,—all the hoofs Of King Saul's father's asses, in full drove, And obviously deserve it. He appealed To these,—and why say more if they condemn, Than if they praise him?—Weep, my Æschylus, But low and far, upon Sicilian shores! For since 'twas Athens (so I read the myth) Who gave commission to that fatal weight The tortoise, cold and hard, to drop on thee And crush thee,—better cover thy bald head; She'll hear the softest hum of Hyblan bee Before thy loudest protestation! Then The risk's still worse upon the modern stage. I could not, for so little, accept success, Nor would I risk so much, in ease and calm, For manifester gains: let those who prize, Pursue them: I stand off. And yet, forbid That any irreverent fancy or conceit Should litter in the Drama's throne-room where The rulers of our art, in whose full veins Dynastic glories mingle, sit in strength And do their kingly work,—conceive, command, And, from the imagination's crucial heat, Catch up their men and women all a-flame For action, all alive and forced to prove Their life by living out heart, brain, and nerve, Until mankind makes witness, “These be men As we are,” and vouchsafes the greeting due To Imogen and Juliet—sweetest kin On art's side. 'Tis that, honouring to its worth The drama, I would fear to keep it down To the level of the footlights. Dies no more The sacrificial goat, for Bacchus slain, His filmed eyes fluttered by the whirling white Of choral vestures,—troubled in his blood, While tragic voices that clanged keen as swords, Leapt high together with the altar-flame And made the blue air wink. The waxen mask, Which set the grand still front of Themis' son Upon the puckered visage of a player,— The buskin, which he rose upon and moved, As some tall ship first conscious of the wind Sweeps slowly past the piers,—the mouthpiece, where The mere man's voice with all its breaths and breaks Went sheathed in brass, and clashed on even heights Its phrasèd thunders,—these things are no more, Which once were. And concluding, which is clear, The growing drama has outgrown such toys Of simulated stature, face, and speech, It also peradventure may outgrow The simulation of the painted scene, Boards, actors, prompters, gaslight, and costume, And take for a worthier stage the soul itself, Its shifting fancies and celestial lights, With all its grand orchestral silences To keep the pauses of its rhythmic sounds. Alas, I still see something to be done, And what I do falls short of what I see, Though I waste myself on doing. Long green days, Worn bare of grass and sunshine,—long calm nights From which the silken sleeps were fretted out, Be witness for me, with no amateur's Irreverent haste and busy idleness I set myself to art! What then? what's done? What's done, at last? Behold, at last, a book. If life-blood's necessary, which it is,— (By that blue vein athrob on Mahomet's brow, Each prophet-poet's book must show man's blood!) If life-blood's fertilising, I wrung mine On every leaf of this,—unless the drops Slid heavily on one side and left it dry. That chances often: many a fervid man Writes books as cold and flat as graveyard stones From which the lichen's scraped; and if Saint Preux Had written his own letters, as he might, We had never wept to think of the little mole 'Neath Julie's drooping eyelid. Passion is But something suffered, after all. While Art Sets action on the top of suffering: The artist's part is both to be and do, Transfixing with a special, central power The flat experience of the common man, And turning outward, with a sudden wrench, Half agony, half ecstasy, the thing He feels the inmost,—never felt the less Because he sings it. Does a torch less burn For burning next reflectors of blue steel, That he should be the colder for his place 'Twixt two incessant fires,—his personal life's And that intense refraction which burns back Perpetually against him from the round Of crystal conscience he was born into If artist-born? O sorrowful great gift Conferred on poets, of a twofold life, When one life has been found enough for pain! We, staggering 'neath our burden as mere men, Being called to stand up straight as demigods, Support the intolerable strain and stress Of the universal, and send clearly up, With voices broken by the human sob, Our poems to find rhymes among the stars! But soft,—a “poet” is a word soon said, A book's a thing soon written. Nay, indeed, The more the poet shall be questionable, The more unquestionably comes his book. And this of mine—well, granting to myself Some passion in it,—furrowing up the flats, Mere passion will not prove a volume worth Its gall and rags even. Bubbles round a keel Mean nought, excepting that the vessel moves. There's more than passion goes to make a man Or book, which is a man too. I am sad. I wonder if Pygmalion had these doubts And, feeling the hard marble first relent, Grow supple to the straining of his arms, And tingle through its cold to his burning lip, Supposed his senses mocked, supposed the toil Of stretching past the known and seen to reach The archetypal Beauty out of sight, Had made his heart beat fast enough for two, And with his own life dazed and blinded him! Not so; Pygmalion loved,—and whoso loves Believes the impossible. But I am sad: I cannot thoroughly love a work of mine, Since none seems worthy of my thought and hope More highly mated. He has shot them down, My Phœbus Apollo, soul within my soul, Who judges, by the attempted, what's attained, And with the silver arrow from his height Has struck down all my works before my face While I said nothing. Is there aught to say? I called the artist but a greatened man. He may be childless also, like a man. I laboured on alone. The wind and dust And sun of the world beat blistering in my face; And hope, now for me, now against me, dragged My spirits onward, as some fallen balloon, Which, whether caught by blossoming tree or bare, Is torn alike. I sometimes touched my aim, Or seemed,—and generous souls cried out “Be strong, Take courage; now you're on our level,—now! The next step saves you!” I was flushed with praise, But, pausing just a moment to draw breath, I could not choose but murmur to myself “Is this all? all that's done? and all that's gained? If this then be success, 'tis dismaller Than any failure.” O my God, my God, O supreme Artist, who as sole return For all the cosmic wonder of Thy work, Demandest of us just a word . . . a name, “My Father!” thou hast knowledge, only thou, How dreary 'tis for women to sit still, On winter nights by solitary fires, And hear the nations praising them far off, Too far! ay, praising our quick sense of love, Our very heart of passionate womanhood, Which could not beat so in the verse without Being present also in the unkissed lips And eyes undried because there's none to ask The reason they grew moist. To sit alone And think for comfort how, that very night, Affianced lovers, leaning face to face With sweet half-listenings for each other's breath, Are reading haply from a page of ours, To pause with a thrill (as if their cheeks had touched) When such a stanza, level to their mood, Seems floating their own thought out—“So I feel For thee,”—“And I, for thee: this poet knows What everlasting love is!”—how, that night, Some father, issuing from the misty roads Upon the luminous round of lamp and hearth And happy children, having caught up first The youngest there until it shrink and shriek To feel the cold chin prick its dimples through With winter from the hills, may throw i' the lap Of the eldest (who has learnt to drop her lids To hide some sweetness newer than last year's) Our book and cry, . . . “Ah you, you care for rhymes; So here be rhymes to pore on under trees, When April comes to let you! I've been told They are not idle as so many are, But set hearts beating pure as well as fast. 'Tis yours, the book; I'll write your name in it, That so you may not lose, however lost In poet's lore and charming reverie, The thought of how your father thought of you In riding from the town.” To have our books Appraised by love, associated with love, While we sit loveless! is it hard, you think? At least 'tis mournful. Fame, indeed, 'twas said, Means simply love. It was a man said that: And then, there's love and love: the love of all (To risk in turn a woman's paradox) Is but a small thing to the love of one. You bid a hungry child be satisfied With a heritage of many corn-fields: nay, He says he's hungry,—he would rather have That little barley-cake you keep from him While reckoning up his harvests. So with us (Here, Romney, too, we fail to generalise): We're hungry. Hungry! but it's pitiful To wail like unweaned babes and suck our thumbs Because we're hungry. Who, in all this world (Wherein we are haply set to pray and fast And learn what good is by its opposite), Has never hungered? Woe to him who has found The meal enough! if Ugolino's full, His teeth have crunched some foul unnatural thing, For here satiety proves penury More utterly irremediable. And since We needs must hunger,—better, for man's love, Than God's truth! better, for companions sweet, Than great convictions! let us bear our weights, Preferring dreary hearths to desert souls. Well, well! they say we're envious, we who rhyme; But I, because I am a woman perhaps And so rhyme ill, am ill at envying. I never envied Graham his breadth of style, Which gives you, with a random smutch or two (Near-sighted critics analyse to smutch), Such delicate perspectives of full life: Nor Belmore, for the unity of aim To which he cuts his cedarn poems, fine As sketchers do their pencils: nor Mark Gage, For that caressing colour and trancing tone Whereby you're swept away and melted in The sensual element, which with a back wave Restores you to the level of pure souls And leaves you with Plotinus. None of these, For native gifts or popular applause, I've envied; but for this,—that when by chance Says some one,—“There goes Belmore, a great man! He leaves clean work behind him, and requires No sweeper up of the chips,” . . . a girl I know, Who answers nothing, save with her brown eyes, Smiles unaware as if a guardian saint Smiled in her:—for this, too,—that Gage comes home And lays his last book's prodigal review Upon his mother's knee, where, years ago, He laid his childish spelling-book and learned To chirp and peck the letters from her mouth, As young birds must. “Well done,” she murmured then; She will not say it now more wonderingly: And yet the last “Well done” will touch him more, As catching up to-day and yesterday In a perfect chord of love: and so, Mark Gage, I envy you your mother!—and you, Graham, Because you have a wife who loves you so, She half forgets, at moments, to be proud Of being Graham's wife, until a friend observes, “The boy here has his father's massive brow Done small in wax . . . if we push back the curls.” Who loves me? Dearest father,—mother sweet,— I speak the names out sometimes by myself, And make the silence shiver. They sound strange, As Hindostanee to an Ind-born man Accustomed many years to English speech; Or lovely poet-words grown obsolete, Which will not leave off singing. Up in heaven I have my father,—with my mother's face Beside him in a blotch of heavenly light; No more for earth's familiar, household use, No more. The best verse written by this hand Can never reach them where they sit, to seem Well done to them. Death quite unfellows us, Sets dreadful odds betwixt the live and dead, And makes us part as those at Babel did Through sudden ignorance of a common tongue. A living Cæsar would not dare to play At bowls with such as my dead father is. And yet this may be less so than appears, This change and separation. Sparrows five For just two farthings, and God cares for each. If God is not too great for little cares, Is any creature, because gone to God? I've seen some men, veracious, nowise mad, Who have thought or dreamed, declared and testified They heard the Dead a-ticking like a clock Which strikes the hours of the eternities, Beside them, with their natural ears,—and known That human spirits feel the human way And hate the unreasoning awe which waves them off From possible communion. It may be. At least, earth separates as well as heaven. For instance, I have not seen Romney Leigh Full eighteen months . . . add six, you get two years. They say he's very busy with good works,— Has parted Leigh Hall into almshouses. He made one day an almshouse of his heart, Which ever since is loose upon the latch For those who pull the string.—I never did. It always makes me sad to go abroad, And now I'm sadder that I went to-night Among the lights and talkers at Lord Howe's. His wife is gracious, with her glossy braids, And even voice, and gorgeous eyeballs, calm As her other jewels. If she's somewhat cold, Who wonders, when her blood has stood so long In the ducal reservoir she calls her line By no means arrogantly? she's not proud; Not prouder than the swan is of the lake He has always swum in;—'tis her element; And so she takes it with a natural grace, Ignoring tadpoles. She just knows perhaps There are who travel without outriders, Which isn't her fault. Ah, to watch her face, When good Lord Howe expounds his theories Of social justice and equality! 'Tis curious, what a tender, tolerant bend Her neck takes: for she loves him, likes his talk, “Such clever talk—that dear, odd Algernon!” She listens on, exactly as if he talked Some Scandinavian myth of Lemures, Too pretty to dispute, and too absurd. She's gracious to me as her husband's friend, And would be gracious were I not a Leigh, Being used to smile just so, without her eyes, On Joseph Strangways the Leeds mesmerist, And Delia Dobbs the lecturer from “the States” Upon the “Woman's question.” Then, for him, I like him; he's my friend. And all the rooms Were full of crinkling silks that swept about The fine dust of most subtle courtesies. What then?—why then, we come home to be sad. How lovely, One I love not looked to-night! She's very pretty, Lady Waldemar. Her maid must use both hands to twist that coil Of tresses, then be careful lest the rich Bronze rounds should slip:—she missed, though, a grey hair, A single one,—I saw it; otherwise The woman looked immortal. How they told, Those alabaster shoulders and bare breasts, On which the pearls, drowned out of sight in milk, Were lost, excepting for the ruby-clasp! They split the amaranth velvet-bodice down To the waist or nearly, with the audacious press Of full-breathed beauty. If the heart within Were half as white!—but, if it were, perhaps The breast were closer covered and the sight Less aspectable by half, too. I heard The young man with the German student's look— A sharp face, like a knife in a cleft stick, Which shot up straight against the parting line So equally dividing the long hair,— Say softly to his neighbour (thirty-five And mediæval), “Look that way, Sir Blaise. She's Lady Waldemar—to the left—in red— Whom Romney Leigh, our ablest man just now, Is soon about to marry.” Then replied Sir Blaise Delorme, with quiet, priestlike voice, Too used to syllable damnations round To make a natural emphasis worth while: “Is Leigh your ablest man? the same, I think, Once jilted by a recreant pretty maid Adopted from the people? Now, in change, He seems to have plucked a flower from the other side Of the social hedge.” “A flower, a flower,” exclaimed My German student,—his own eyes full-blown Bent on her. He was twenty, certainly. Sir Blaise resumed with gentle arrogance, As if he had dropped his alms into a hat And gained the right to counsel,—“My young friend, I doubt your ablest man's ability To get the least good or help meet for him, For pagan phalanstery or Christian home, From such a flowery creature.” “Beautiful!” My student murmured rapt,—“Mark how she stirs! Just waves her head, as if a flower indeed, Touched far off by the vain breath of our talk.” At which that bilious Grimwald (he who writes For the Renovator), who had seemed absorbed Upon the table-book of autographs (I dare say mentally he crunched the bones Of all those writers, wishing them alive To feel his tooth in earnest), turned short round With low carnivorous laugh,—“A flower, of course! She neither sews nor spins,—and takes no thought Of her garments . . . falling off.” The student flinched; Sir Blaise, the same; then both, drawing back their chairs As if they spied black-beetles on the floor, Pursued their talk, without a word being thrown To the critic. Good Sir Blaise's brow is high And noticeably narrow: a strong wind, You fancy, might unroof him suddenly, And blow that great top attic off his head So piled with feudal relics. You admire His nose in profile, though you miss his chin; But, though you miss his chin, you seldom miss His ebon cross worn innermostly (carved For penance by a saintly Styrian monk Whose flesh was too much with him), slipping through Some unaware unbuttoned casualty Of the under-waistcoat. With an absent air Sir Blaise sat fingering it and speaking low, While I, upon the sofa, heard it all. “My dear young friend, if we could bear our eyes, Like blessedest Saint Lucy, on a plate, They would not trick us into choosing wives, As doublets, by the colour. Otherwise Our fathers chose,—and therefore, when they had hung Their household keys about a lady's waist, The sense of duty gave her dignity; She kept her bosom holy to her babes, And, if a moralist reproved her dress, 'Twas ‘Too much starch!’—and not ‘Too little lawn!’” “Now, pshaw!” returned the other in a heat, A little fretted by being called “young friend,” Or so I took it,—“for Saint Lucy's sake, If she's the saint to swear by, let us leave Our fathers,—plagued enough about our sons!” (He stroked his beardless chin) “yes, plagued, sir, plagued: The future generations lie on us As heavy as the nightmare of a seer; Our meat and drink grow painful prophecy: I ask you,—have we leisure, if we liked, To hollow out our weary hands to keep Your intermittent rushlight of the past From draughts in lobbies? Prejudice of sex And marriage-law . . . the socket drops them through While we two speak,—however may protest Some over-delicate nostrils like your own, 'Gainst odours thence arising.” “You are young,” Sir Blaise objected. “If I am,” he said With fire,—“though somewhat less so than I seem, The young run on before, and see the thing That's coming. Reverence for the young, I cry. In that new church for which the world's near ripe, You'll have the younger in the Elder's chair, Presiding with his ivory front of hope O'er foreheads clawed by cruel carrion-birds Of life's experience.” “Pray your blessing, sir,” Sir Blaise replied good-humouredly,—“I plucked A silver hair this morning from my beard, Which left me your inferior. Would I were Eighteen and worthy to admonish you! If young men of your order run before To see such sights as sexual prejudice And marriage-law dissolved,—in plainer words, A general concubinage expressed In a universal pruriency,—the thing Is scarce worth running fast for, and you'd gain By loitering with your elders.” “Ah,” he said, “Who, getting to the top of Pisgah-hill, Can talk with one at bottom of the view, To make it comprehensible? Why, Leigh Himself, although our ablest man, I said, Is scarce advanced to see as far as this, Which some are: he takes up imperfectly The social question—by one handle—leaves The rest to trail. A Christian socialist Is Romney Leigh, you understand.” “Not I. I disbelieve in Christian-pagans, much As you in women-fishes. If we mix Two colours, we lose both, and make a third Distinct from either. Mark you! to mistake A colour is the sign of a sick brain, And mine, I thank the saints, is clear and cool: A neutral tint is here impossible. The church,—and by the church I mean, of course, The catholic, apostolic, mother-church,— Draws lines as plain and straight as her own walls, Inside of which are Christians, obviously. And outside . . . dogs.” “We thank you. Well I know The ancient mother-church would fain still bite, For all her toothless gums,—as Leigh himself Would fain be a Christian still, for all his wit. Pass that; you two may settle it, for me. You're slow in England. In a month I learnt At Göttingen enough philosophy To stock your English schools for fifty years; Pass that, too. Here alone, I stop you short, —Supposing a true man like Leigh could stand Unequal in the stature of his life To the height of his opinions. Choose a wife Because of a smooth skin?—not he, not he! He'd rail at Venus' self for creaking shoes, Unless she walked his way of righteousness: And if he takes a Venus Meretrix (No imputation on the lady there), Be sure that, by some sleight of Christian art, He has metamorphosed and converted her To a Blessed Virgin.” “Soft!” Sir Blaise drew breath As if it hurt him,—“Soft! no blasphemy, I pray you!” “The first Christians did the thing: Why not the last?” asked he of Göttingen, With just that shade of sneering on the lip Compensates for the lagging of the beard,— “And so the case is. If that fairest fair Is talked of as the future wife of Leigh, She's talked of too, at least as certainly, As Leigh's disciple. You may find her name On all his missions and commissions, schools, Asylums, hospitals,—he had her down, With other ladies whom her starry lead Persuaded from their spheres, to his country-place In Shropshire, to the famed phalanstery At Leigh Hall, christianised from Fourier's own (In which he has planted out his sapling stocks Of knowledge into social nurseries), And there, they say, she has tarried half a week, And milked the cows, and churned, and pressed the curd, And said ‘my sister’ to the lowest drab Of all the assembled castaways; such girls! Ay, sided with them at the washing-tub— Conceive, Sir Blaise, those naked perfect arms, Round glittering arms, plunged elbow-deep in suds, Like wild swans hid in lilies all a-shake.” Lord Howe came up. “What, talking poetry So near the image of the unfavouring Muse? That's you, Miss Leigh: I've watched you half an hour Precisely as I watched the statue called A Pallas in the Vatican;—you mind The face, Sir Blaise?—intensely calm and sad, As wisdom cut it off from fellowship,— But that spoke louder. Not a word from you! And these two gentlemen were bold, I marked, And unabashed by even your silence.” “Ah,” Said I, “my dear Lord Howe, you shall not speak To a printing woman who has lost her place (The sweet safe corner of the household fire Behind the heads of children), compliments, As if she were a woman. We who have clipt The curls before our eyes may see at least As plain as men do. Speak out, man to man; No compliments, beseech you.” “Friend to friend, Let that be. We are sad to-night, I saw (—Good night, Sir Blaise! ah, Smith—he has slipped away), I saw you across the room, and stayed, Miss Leigh, To keep a crowd of lion-hunters off, With faces toward your jungle. There were three; A spacious lady, five feet ten and fat, Who has the devil in her (and there's room) For walking to and fro upon the earth, From Chipewa to China; she requires Your autograph upon a tinted leaf 'Twixt Queen Pomare's and Emperor Soulouque's. Pray give it; she has energies, though fat: For me, I'd rather see a rick on fire Than such a woman angry. Then a youth Fresh from the backwoods, green as the underboughs, Asks modestly, Miss Leigh, to kiss your shoe, And adds, he has an epic in twelve parts, Which when you've read, you'll do it for his boot: All which I saved you, and absorb next week Both manuscript and man,—because a lord Is still more potent than a poetess With any extreme republican. Ah, ah, You smile, at last, then.” “Thank you.” “Leave the smile. I'll lose the thanks for't,—ay, and throw you in My transatlantic girl, with golden eyes, That draw you to her splendid whiteness as The pistil of a water-lily draws, Adust with gold. Those girls across the sea Are tyrannously pretty,—and I swore (She seemed to me an innocent, frank girl) To bring her to you for a woman's kiss, Not now, but on some other day or week: —We'll call it perjury; I give her up.” “No, bring her.” “Now,” said he, “you make it hard To touch such goodness with a grimy palm. I thought to tease you well, and fret you cross, And steel myself, when rightly vexed with you, For telling you a thing to tease you more.” “Of Romney?” “No, no; nothing worse,” he cried, “Of Romney Leigh than what is buzzed about,— That he is taken in an eye-trap too, Like many half as wise. The thing I mean Refers to you, not him.” “Refers to me.” He echoed,—“Me! You sound it like a stone Dropped down a dry well very listlessly By one who never thinks about the toad Alive at the bottom. Presently perhaps You'll sound your ‘me’ more proudly—till I shrink.” “Lord Howe's the toad, then, in this question?” “Brief, We'll take it graver. Give me sofa-room, And quiet hearing. You know Eglinton, John Eglinton, of Eglinton in Kent?” “Is he the toad?—he's rather like the snail, Known chiefly for the house upon his back: Divide the man and house—you kill the man; That's Eglinton of Eglinton, Lord Howe.” He answered grave. “A reputable man, An excellent landlord of the olden stamp, If somewhat slack in new philanthropies, Who keeps his birthdays with a tenants' dance, Is hard upon them when they miss the church Or hold their children back from catechism, But not ungentle when the agèd poor Pick sticks at hedge-sides: nay, I've heard him say ‘The old dame has a twinge because she stoops; That's punishment enough for felony.’” “O tender-hearted landlord! may I take My long lease with him, when the time arrives For gathering winter-faggots!” “He likes art, Buys books and pictures . . . of a certain kind; Neglects no patent duty; a good son” . . . “To a most obedient mother. Born to wear His father's shoes, he wears her husband's too: Indeed I've heard it's touching. Dear Lord Howe, You shall not praise me so against your heart, When I'm at worst for praise and faggots.” “Be Less bitter with me, for . . . in short,” he said, “I have a letter, which he urged me so To bring you . . . I could scarcely choose but yield; Insisting that a new love, passing through The hand of an old friendship, caught from it Some reconciling odour.” “Love, you say? My lord, I cannot love: I only find The rhyme for love,—and that's not love, my lord. Take back your letter.” “Pause: you'll read it first?” “I will not read it: it is stereotyped; The same he wrote to,—anybody's name, Anne Blythe the actress, when she died so true, A duchess fainted in a private box: Pauline the dancer, after the great pas In which her little feet winked overhead Like other fire-flies, and amazed the pit: Or Baldinacci, when her F in alt Had touched the silver tops of heaven itself With such a pungent spirit-dart, the Queen Laid softly, each to each, her white-gloved palms, And sighed for joy: or else (I thank your friend) Aurora Leigh,—when some indifferent rhymes, Like those the boys sang round the holy ox On Memphis-highway, chance perhaps to set Our Apis-public lowing. Oh, he wants, Instead of any worthy wife at home, A star upon his stage of Eglinton? Advise him that he is not overshrewd In being so little modest: a dropped star Makes bitter waters, says a Book I've read,— And there's his unread letter.” “My dear friend,” Lord Howe began . . . In haste I tore the phrase. “You mean your friend of Eglinton, or me?” “I mean you, you,” he answered with some fire. “A happy life means prudent compromise; The tare runs through the farmer's garnered sheaves, And though the gleaner's apron holds pure wheat We count her poorer. Tare with wheat, we cry, And good with drawbacks. You, you love your art, And, certain of vocation, set your soul On utterance. Only, in this world we have made (They say God made it first, but if He did 'Twas so long since, and, since, we have spoiled it so, He scarce would know it, if He looked this way, From hells we preach of, with the flames blown out), —In this bad, twisted, topsy-turvy world Where all the heaviest wrongs get uppermost,— In this uneven, unfostering England here, Where ledger-strokes and sword-strokes count indeed, But soul-strokes merely tell upon the flesh They strike from,—it is hard to stand for art, Unless some golden tripod from the sea Be fished up, by Apollo's divine chance, To throne such feet as yours, my prophetess, At Delphi. Think,—the god comes down as fierce As twenty bloodhounds, shakes you, strangles you, Until the oracular shriek shall ooze in froth! At best 'tis not all ease,—at worst too hard: A place to stand on is a 'vantage gained, And here's your tripod. To be plain, dear friend, You're poor, except in what you richly give; You labour for your own bread painfully Or ere you pour our wine. For art's sake, pause.” I answered slow,—as some wayfaring man, Who feels himself at night too far from home, Makes steadfast face against the bitter wind. “Is art so less a thing than virtue is, That artists first must cater for their ease Or ever they make issue past themselves To generous use? Alas, and is it so That we, who would be somewhat clean, must sweep Our ways as well as walk them, and no friend Confirm us nobly,—‘Leave results to God, But you, be clean?’ What! ‘prudent compromise Makes acceptable life,’ you say instead, You, you, Lord Howe?—in things indifferent, well. For instance, compromise the wheaten bread For rye, the meat for lentils, silk for serge, And sleep on down, if needs, for sleep on straw; But there, end compromise. I will not bate One artist-dream on straw or down, my lord, Nor pinch my liberal soul, though I be poor, Nor cease to love high, though I live thus low.” So speaking, with less anger in my voice Than sorrow, I rose quickly to depart; While he, thrown back upon the noble shame Of such high-stumbling natures, murmured words, The right words after wrong ones. Ah, the man Is worthy, but so given to entertain Impossible plans of superhuman life,— He sets his virtues on so raised a shelf, To keep them at the grand millennial height, He has to mount a stool to get at them; And, meantime, lives on quite the common way, With everybody's morals. As we passed, Lord Howe insisting that his friendly arm Should oar me across the sparkling brawling stream Which swept from room to room,—we fell at once On Lady Waldemar. “Miss Leigh,” she said, And gave me such a smile, so cold and bright, As if she tried it in a 'tiring glass And liked it, “all to-night I've strained at you As babes at baubles held up out of reach By spiteful nurses (‘Never snatch,’ they say), And there you sat, most perfectly shut in By good Sir Blaise and clever Mister Smith And then our dear Lord Howe! at last indeed I almost snatched. I have a world to speak About your cousin's place in Shropshire, where I've been to see his work . . . our work,—you heard I went? . . . and of a letter yesterday, In which if I should read a page or two You might feel interest, though you're locked of course In literary toil.—You'll like to hear Your last book lies at the phalanstery, As judged innocuous for the elder girls And younger women who still care for books. We all must read, you see, before we live, Till slowly the ineffable light comes up And, as it deepens, drowns the written word,— So said your cousin, while we stood and felt A sunset from his favourite beech-tree seat. He might have been a poet if he would, But then he saw the higher thing at once And climbed to it. I think he looks well now, Has quite got over that unfortunate . . . Ah, ah . . . I know it moved you. Tender-heart! You took a liking to the wretched girl. Perhaps you thought the marriage suitable, Who knows? a poet hankers for romance, And so on. As for Romney Leigh, 'tis sure He never loved her,—never. By the way, You have not heard of her . . .? quite out of sight, And out of saving? lost in every sense?” She might have gone on talking half an hour And I stood still, and cold, and pale, I think, As a garden-statue a child pelts with snow For pretty pastime. Every now and then I put in “yes” or “no,” I scarce knew why; The blind man walks wherever the dog pulls, And so I answered. Till Lord Howe broke in: “What penance takes the wretch who interrupts The talk of charming women? I, at last, Must brave it. Pardon, Lady Waldemar, The lady on my arm is tired, unwell, And loyally I've promised she shall say No harder word this evening than . . .good-night; The rest her face speaks for her.”—Then we went. And I breathe large at home. I drop my cloak, Unclasp my girdle, loose the band that ties My hair . . . now could I but unloose my soul! We are sepulchred alive in this close world, And want more room. The charming woman there— This reckoning up and writing down her talk Affects me singularly. How she talked To pain me! woman's spite.—You wear steel-mail: A woman takes a housewife from her breast And plucks the delicatest needle out As 'twere a rose, and pricks you carefully 'Neath nails, 'neath eyelids, in your nostrils,—say, A beast would roar so tortured,—but a man, A human creature, must not, shall not flinch, No, not for shame. What vexes, after all, Is just that such as she, with such as I, Knows how to vex. Sweet heaven, she takes me up As if she had fingered me and dog-eared me And spelled me by the fireside half a life! She knows my turns, my feeble points.—What then? The knowledge of a thing implies the thing; Of course, she found that in me, she saw that, Her pencil underscored this for a fault, And I, still ignorant. Shut the book up,—close! And crush that beetle in the leaves. O heart, At last we shall grow hard too, like the rest, And call it self-defence because we are soft. And after all, now . . . why should I be pained That Romney Leigh, my cousin, should espouse This Lady Waldemar? And, say, she held Her newly-blossomed gladness in my face, . . . 'Twas natural surely, if not generous, Considering how, when winter held her fast, I helped the frost with mine, and pained her more Than she pains me. Pains me!—but wherefore pained? 'Tis clear my cousin Romney wants a wife,— So, good!—The man's need of the woman, here, Is greater than the woman's of the man, And easier served; for where the man discerns A sex (ah, ah, the man can generalise, Said he), we see but one, ideally And really: where we yearn to lose ourselves And melt like white pearls in another's wine, He seeks to double himself by what he loves, And make his drink more costly by our pearls. At board, at bed, at work and holiday, It is not good for man to be alone, And that's his way of thinking, first and last, And thus my cousin Romney wants a wife. But then my cousin sets his dignity On personal virtue. If he understands By love, like others, self-aggrandisement, It is that he may verily be great By doing rightly and kindly. Once he thought, For charitable ends set duly forth In Heaven's white judgment-book, to marry . . . ah, We'll call her name Aurora Leigh, although She's changed since then!—and once, for social ends, Poor Marian Erle, my sister Marian Erle, My woodland sister, sweet maid Marian, Whose memory moans on in me like the wind Through ill-shut casements, making me more sad Than ever I find reasons for. Alas, Poor pretty plaintive face, embodied ghost! He finds it easy then, to clap thee off From pulling at his sleeve and book and pen,— He locks thee out at night into the cold Away from butting with thy horny eyes Against his crystal dreams, that now he's strong To love anew? that Lady Waldemar Succeeds my Marian? After all, why not? He loved not Marian, more than once he loved Aurora. If he loves at last that Third, Albeit she prove as slippery as spilt oil On marble floors, I will not augur him Ill-luck for that. Good love, howe'er ill-placed, Is better for a man's soul in the end, That if he loved ill what deserves love well. A pagan, kissing for a step of Pan The wild-goat's hoof-print on the loamy down, Exceeds our modern thinker who turns back The strata . . . granite, limestone, coal, and clay, Concluding coldly with “Here's law! where's God?” And then at worst,—if Romney loves her not,— At worst—if he's incapable of love, Which may be—then indeed, for such a man Incapable of love, she's good enough; For she, at worst too, is a woman still And loves him . . . as the sort of woman can. My loose long hair began to burn and creep, Alive to the very ends, about my knees: I swept it backward as the wind sweeps flame, With the passion of my hands. Ah, Romney laughed One day . . . (how full the memories come up!) “—Your Florence fire-flies live on in your hair,” He said, “it gleams so.” Well, I wrung them out, My fire-flies; made a knot as hard as life Of those loose, soft, impracticable curls, And then sat down and thought . . . “She shall not think Her thought of me,”—and drew my desk and wrote. “Dear Lady Waldemar, I could not speak With people round me, nor can sleep to-night And not speak, after the great news I heard Of you and of my cousin. May you be Most happy; and the good he meant the world Replenish his own life. Say what I say, And let my word be sweeter for your mouth, As you are you . . . I only Aurora Leigh.” That's quiet, guarded: though she hold it up Against the light, she'll not see through it more Than lies there to be seen. So much for pride; And now for peace, a little. Let me stop All writing back . . . “Sweet thanks, my sweetest friend, You've made more joyful my great joy itself.” —No, that's too simple! she would twist it thus, “My joy would still be as sweet as thyme in drawers, However shut up in the dark and dry; But violets, aired and dewed by love like yours, Out-smell all thyme: we keep that in our clothes, But drop the other down our bosoms till They smell like—” . . . ah, I see her writing back Just so. She'll make a nosegay of her words, And tie it with blue ribbons at the end To suit a poet;—pshaw! And then we'll have The call to church, the broken, sad, bad dream Dreamed out at last, the marriage-vow complete With the marriage breakfast; praying in white gloves, Drawn off in haste for drinking pagan toasts In somewhat stronger wine than any sipped By gods since Bacchus had his way with grapes. A postscript stops all that and rescues me. “You need not write. I have been overworked, And think of leaving London, England even, And hastening to get nearer to the sun Where men sleep better. So, adieu.”—I fold And seal,—and now I'm out of all the coil; I breathe now, I spring upward like a branch The ten-years school-boy with a crooked stick May pull down to his level in search of nuts, But cannot hold a moment. How we twang Back on the blue sky, and assert our height, While he stares after! Now, the wonder seems That I could wrong myself by such a doubt. We poets always have uneasy hearts, Because our hearts, large-rounded as the globe, Can turn but one side to the sun at once. We are used to dip our artist-hands in gall And potash, trying potentialities Of alternated colour, till at last We get confused, and wonder for our skin How nature tinged it first. Well—here's the true Good flesh-colour; I recognise my hand,— Which Romney Leigh may clasp as just a friend's, And keep his clean. And now, my Italy. Alas, if we could ride with naked souls And make no noise and pay no price at all, I would have seen thee sooner, Italy, For still I have heard thee crying through my life, Thou piercing silence of ecstatic graves, Men call that name! But even a witch to-day Must melt down golden pieces in the nard Wherewith to anoint her broomstick ere she rides; And poets evermore are scant of gold, And if they find a piece behind the door It turns by sunset to a withered leaf. The Devil himself scarce trusts his patented Gold-making art to any who make rhymes, But culls his Faustus from philosophers And not from poets. “Leave my Job,” said God; And so the Devil leaves him without pence, And poverty proves plainly special grace. In these new, just, administrative times Men clamour for an order of merit: why? Here's black bread on the table and no wine! At least I am a poet in being poor, Thank God. I wonder if the manuscript Of my long poem, if 'twere sold outright, Would fetch enough to buy me shoes to go Afoot (thrown in, the necessary patch For the other side the Alps)? It cannot be. I fear that I must sell this residue Of my father's books, although the Elzevirs Have fly-leaves overwritten by his hand In faded notes as thick and fine and brown As cobwebs on a tawny monument Of the old Greeks—conferenda hæc cum his— Corruptè citat—lege potiùs, And so on, in the scholar's regal way Of giving judgment on the parts of speech, As if he sat on all twelve thrones up-piled, Arraigning Israel. Ay, but books and notes Must go together. And this Proclus too, In these dear quaint contracted Grecian types, Fantastically crumpled like his thoughts Which would not seem too plain; you go round twice For one step forward, then you take it back Because you're somewhat giddy; there's the rule For Proclus. Ah, I stained this middle leaf With pressing in't my Florence iris-bell, Long stalk and all: my father chided me For that stain of blue blood,—I recollect The peevish turn his voice took,—“Silly girls, Who plant their flowers in our philosophy To make it fine, and only spoil the book! No more of it, Aurora.” Yes—no more! Ah, blame of love, that's sweeter than all praise Of those who love not! 'tis so lost to me, I cannot, in such beggared life, afford To lose my Proclus,—not for Florence even. The kissing Judas, Wolff, shall go instead, Who builds us such a royal book as this To honour a chief-poet, folio-built, And writes above “The house of Nobody!” Who floats in cream, as rich as any sucked From Juno's breasts, the broad Homeric lines, And, while with their spondaic prodigious mouths They lap the lucent margins as babe-gods, Proclaims them bastards. Wolff's an atheist: And if the Iliad fell out, as he says, By mere fortuitous concourse of old songs, Conclude as much too for the universe. That Wolff, those Platos: sweep the upper shelves As clean as this, and so I am almost rich, Which means, not forced to think of being poor In sight of ends. To-morrow: no delay. I'll wait in Paris till good Carrington Dispose of such and, having chaffered for My book's price with the publisher, direct All proceeds to me. Just a line to ask His help. And now I come, my Italy, My own hills! Are you 'ware of me, my hills, How I burn toward you? do you feel to-night The urgency and yearning of my soul, As sleeping mothers feel the sucking babe And smile?—Nay, not so much as when in heat Vain lightnings catch at your inviolate tops And tremble while ye are steadfast. Still ye go Your own determined, calm, indifferent way Toward sunrise, shade by shade, and light by light, Of all the grand progression nought left out, As if God verily made you for yourselves And would not interrupt your life with ours. SIXTH BOOK. The English have a scornful insular way Of calling the French light. The levity Is in the judgment only, which yet stands, For say a foolish thing but oft enough (And here's the secret of a hundred creeds, Men get opinions as boys learn to spell, By reiteration chiefly), the same thing Shall pass at last for absolutely wise, And not with fools exclusively. And so We say the French are light, as if we said The cat mews or the milch-cow gives us milk: Say rather, cats are milked and milch-cows mew; For what is lightness but inconsequence, Vague fluctuation 'twixt effect and cause Compelled by neither? Is a bullet light That dashes from the gun-mouth, while the eye Winks and the heart beats one, to flatten itself To a wafer on the white speck on a wall A hundred paces off? Even so direct, So sternly undivertible of aim, Is this French people. All, idealists Too absolute and earnest, with them all The idea of a knife cuts real flesh; And still, devouring the safe interval Which Nature placed between the thought and act With those two fiery and impatient souls, They threaten conflagration to the world, And rush with most unscrupulous logic on Impossible practice. Set your orators To blow upon them with loud windy mouths, Through watchword phrases, jest or sentiment, Which drive our burly brutal English mobs Like so much chaff, whichever way they blow,— This light French people will not thus be driven. They turn indeed,—but then they turn upon Some central pivot of their thought and choice, And veer out by the force of holding fast. That's hard to understand, for Englishmen Unused to abstract questions, and untrained To trace the involutions, valve by valve, In each orbed bulb-root of a general truth, And mark what subtly fine integument Divides opposed compartments. Freedom's self Comes concrete to us, to be understood, Fixed in a feudal form incarnately To suit our ways of thought and reverence, The special form, with us, being still the thing. With us, I say, though I'm of Italy By mother's birth and grave, by father's grave And memory; let it be—a poet's heart Can swell to a pair of nationalities, However ill-lodged in a woman's breast. And so I am strong to love this noble France, This poet of the nations, who dreams on And wails on (while the household goes to wreck) For ever, after some ideal good,— Some equal poise of sex, some unvowed love Inviolate, some spontaneous brotherhood, Some wealth that leaves none poor and finds none tired, Some freedom of the many that respects The wisdom of the few. Heroic dreams! Sublime, to dream so; natural, to wake: And sad, to use such lofty scaffoldings, Erected for the building of a church, To build instead a brothel or a prison— May God save France! And if at last she sighs Her great soul up into a great man's face, To flush his temples out so gloriously That few dare carp at Cæsar for being bald, What then?—this Cæsar represents, not reigns, And is no despot, though twice absolute: This Head has all the people for a heart; This purple's lined with the democracy,— Now let him see to it! for a rent within Would leave irreparable rags without. A serious riddle: find such anywhere Except in France; and when 'tis found in France, Be sure to read it rightly. So, I mused Up and down, up and down, the terraced streets, The glittering boulevards, the white colonnades Of fair fantastic Paris who wears trees Like plumes, as if man made them, spire and tower As if they had grown by nature, tossing up Her fountains in the sunshine of the squares, As if in beauty's game she tossed the dice, Or blew the silver down-balls of her dreams To sow futurity with seeds of thought And count the passage of her festive hours. The city swims in verdure, beautiful As Venice on the waters, the sea-swan. What bosky gardens dropped in close-walled courts Like plums in ladies' laps who start and laugh: What miles of streets that run on after trees, Still carrying all the necessary shops, Those open caskets with the jewels seen! And trade is art, and art's philosophy, In Paris. There's a silk for instance, there, As worth an artist's study for the folds As that bronze opposite! nay, the bronze has faults, Art's here too artful,—conscious as a maid Who leans to mark her shadow on the wall Until she lose a vantage in her step. Yet Art walks forward, and knows where to walk; The artists also are idealists, Too absolute for nature, logical To austerity in the application of The special theory,—not a soul content To paint a crooked pollard and an ass, As the English will because they find it so And like it somehow.—There the old Tuileries Is pulling its high cap down on its eyes, Confounded, conscience-stricken, and amazed By the apparition of a new fair face In those devouring mirrors. Through the grate Within the gardens, what a heap of babes, Swept up like leaves beneath the chestnut-trees From every street and alley of the town, By ghosts perhaps that blow too bleak this way A-looking for their heads! dear pretty babes, I wish them luck to have their ball-play out Before the next change. Here the air is thronged With statues poised upon their columns fine, As if to stand a moment were a feat, Against that blue! What squares,—what breathing-room For a nation that runs fast,—ay, runs against The dentist's teeth at the corner in pale rows, Which grin at progress, in an epigram. I walked the day out, listening to the chink Of the first Napoleon's bones in his second grave, By victories guarded 'neath the golden dome That caps all Paris like a bubble. “Shall These dry bones live?” thought Louis Philippe once, And lived to know. Herein is argument For kings and politicians, but still more For poets, who bear buckets to the well Of ampler draught. These crowds are very good For meditation (when we are very strong) Though love of beauty makes us timorous, And draws us backward from the coarse town-sights To count the daisies upon dappled fields And hear the streams bleat on among the hills In innocent and indolent repose, While still with silken elegiac thoughts We wind out from us the distracting world And die into the chrysalis of a man, And leave the best that may, to come of us, In some brown moth. I would be bold and bear To look into the swarthiest face of things, For God's sake who has made them. Six days' work; The last day shutting 'twixt its dawn and eve The whole work bettered of the previous five! Since God collected and resumed in man The firmaments, the strata, and the lights, Fish, fowl, and beast, and insect,—all their trains Of various life caught back upon His arm, Reorganised, and constituted man, The microcosm, the adding up of works,— Within whose fluttering nostrils, then at last Consummating Himself the Maker sighed, As some strong winner at the foot-race sighs Touching the goal. Humanity is great; And, if I would not rather pore upon An ounce of common, ugly, human dust, An artisan's palm or a peasant's brow, Unsmooth, ignoble, save to me and God, Than track old Nilus to his silver roots, Or wait on all the changes of the moon Among the mountain-peaks of Thessaly (Until her magic crystal round itself For many a witch to see in)—set it down As weakness,—strength by no means. How is this, That men of science, osteologists And surgeons, beat some poets in respect For nature,—count nought common or unclean, Spend raptures upon perfect specimens Of indurated veins, distorted joints, Or beautiful new cases of curved spine, While we, we are shocked at nature's falling off, We dare to shrink back from her warts and blains, We will not, when she sneezes, look at her, Not even to say “God bless her”? That's our wrong; For that, she will not trust us often with Her larger sense of beauty and desire, But tethers us to a lily or a rose And bids us diet on the dew inside, Left ignorant that the hungry beggar-boy (Who stares unseen against our absent eyes, And wonders at the gods that we must be, To pass so careless for the oranges!) Bears yet a breastful of a fellow-world To this world, undisparaged, undespoiled, And (while we scorn him for a flower or two, As being, Heaven help us, less poetical) Contains himself both flowers and firmaments And surging seas and aspectable stars And all that we would push him out of sight In order to see nearer. Let us pray God's grace to keep God's image in repute, That so, the poet and philanthropist (Even I and Romney) may stand side by side, Because we both stand face to face with men, Contemplating the people in the rough, Yet each so follow a vocation, his And mine. I walked on, musing with myself On life and art, and whether after all A larger metaphysics might not help Our physics, a completer poetry Adjust our daily life and vulgar wants More fully than the special outside plans, Phalansteries, material institutes, The civil conscriptions and lay monasteries Preferred by modern thinkers, as they thought The bread of man indeed made all his life, And washing seven times in the “People's Baths” Were sovereign for a people's leprosy, Still leaving out the essential prophet's word That comes in power. On which, we thunder down, We prophets, poets,—Virtue's in the word! The maker burnt the darkness up with His, To inaugurate the use of vocal life; And, plant a poet's word even, deep enough In any man's breast, looking presently For offshoots, you have done more for the man Than if you dressed him in a broad-cloth coat And warmed his Sunday pottage at your fire. Yet Romney leaves me . . . God! what face is that? O Romney, O Marian! Walking on the quays And pulling thoughts to pieces leisurely, As if I caught at grasses in a field And bit them slow between my absent lips And shred them with my hands . . . What face is that? What a face, what a look, what a likeness! Full on mine The sudden blow of it came down, till all My blood swam, my eyes dazzled. Then I sprang . . . It was as if a meditative man Were dreaming out a summer afternoon And watching gnats a-prick upon a pond, When something floats up suddenly, out there, Turns over . . . a dead face, known once alive . . . So old, so new! it would be dreadful now To lose the sight and keep the doubt of this: He plunges—ha! he has lost it in the splash. I plunged—I tore the crowd up, either side, And rushed on, forward, forward, after her. Her? whom? A woman sauntered slow in front, Munching an apple,—she left off amazed As if I had snatched it: that's not she, at least. A man walked arm-linked with a lady veiled, Both heads dropped closer than the need of talk: They started; he forgot her with his face, And she, herself, and clung to him as if My look were fatal. Such a stream of folk, And all with cares and business of their own! I ran the whole quay down against their eyes; No Marian; nowhere Marian. Almost, now, I could call Marian, Marian, with the shriek Of desperate creatures calling for the Dead. Where is she, was she? was she anywhere? I stood still, breathless, gazing, straining out In every uncertain distance, till at last A gentleman abstracted as myself Came full against me, then resolved the clash In voluble excuses,—obviously Some learned member of the Institute Upon his way there, walking, for his health, While meditating on the last “Discourse;” Pinching the empty air 'twixt finger and thumb, From which the snuff being ousted by that shock Defiled his snow-white waistcoat duly pricked At the button-hole with honourable red; “Madame, your pardon,”—there he swerved from me A metre, as confounded as he had heard That Dumas would be chosen to fill up The next chair vacant, by his “men in us.” Since when was genius found respectable? It passes in its place, indeed,—which means The seventh floor back, or else the hospital: Revolving pistols are ingenious things, But prudent men (Academicians are) Scarce keep them in the cupboard next the prunes. And so, abandoned to a bitter mirth, I loitered to my inn. O world, O world, O jurists, rhymers, dreamers, what you please, We play a weary game of hide-and-seek! We shape a figure of our fantasy, Call nothing something, and run after it And lose it, lose ourselves too in the search, Till clash against us comes a somebody Who also has lost something and is lost, Philosopher against philanthropist, Academician against poet, man Against woman, against the living the dead,— Then home, with a bad headache and worse jest! To change the water for my heliotropes And yellow roses. Paris has such flowers; But England, also. 'Twas a yellow rose, By that south window of the little house, My cousin Romney gathered with his hand On all my birthdays for me, save the last; And then I shook the tree too rough, too rough, For roses to stay after. Now, my maps. I must not linger here from Italy Till the last nightingale is tired of song, And the last fire-fly dies off in the maize. My soul's in haste to leap into the sun And scorch and seethe itself to a finer mood, Which here, in this chill north, is apt to stand Too stiffly in former moulds. That face persists, It floats up, it turns over in my mind, As like to Marian as one dead is like The same alive. In very deed a face And not a fancy, though it vanished so; The small fair face between the darks of hair, I used to liken, when I saw her first, To a point of moonlit water down a well: The low brow, the frank space between the eyes, Which always had the brown, pathetic look Of a dumb creature who had been beaten once And never since was easy with the world. Ah, ah—now I remember perfectly Those eyes, to-day,—how overlarge they seemed, As if some patient, passionate despair (Like a coal dropped and forgot on tapestry, Which slowly burns a widening circle out) Had burnt them larger, larger. And those eyes, To-day, I do remember, saw me too, As I saw them, with conscious lids astrain In recognition. Now a fantasy, A simple shade or image of the brain, Is merely passive, does not retro-act, Is seen, but sees not. 'Twas a real face, Perhaps a real Marian. Which being so, I ought to write to Romney, “Marian's here; Be comforted for Marian.” My pen fell, My hands struck sharp together, as hands do Which hold at nothing. Can I write to him A half-truth? can I keep my own soul blind To the other half, . . . the worse? What are our souls, If still, to run on straight a sober pace Nor start at every pebble or dead leaf, They must wear blinkers, ignore facts, suppress Six tenths of the road? Confront the truth, my soul! And oh, as truly as that was Marian's face, The arms of that same Marian clasped a thing . . . Not hid so well beneath the scanty shawl, I cannot name it now for what it was. A child. Small business has a castaway Like Marian with that crown of prosperous wives At which the gentlest she grows arrogant And says “My child.” Who finds an emerald ring On a beggar's middle finger and requires More testimony to convict a thief? A child's too costly for so mere a wretch; She filched it somewhere, and it means, with her, Instead of honour, blessing, merely shame. I cannot write to Romney, “Here she is, Here's Marian found! I'll set you on her track: I saw her here, in Paris, . . . and her child. She put away your love two years ago, But, plainly, not to starve. You suffered then; And, now that you've forgot her utterly As any last year's annual, in whose place You've planted a thick-flowering evergreen, I choose, being kind, to write and tell you this To make you wholly easy—she's not dead, But only . . . damned.” Stop there: I go too fast; I'm cruel like the rest,—in haste to take The first stir in the arras for a rat, And set my barking, biting thoughts upon't. —A child! what then? Suppose a neighbour's sick, And asked her, “Marian, carry out my child In this Spring air,”—I punish her for that? Or say, the child should hold her round the neck For good child-reasons, that he liked it so And would not leave her—she had winning ways— I brand her therefore that she took the child? Not so. I will not write to Romney Leigh, For now he's happy,—and she may indeed Be guilty,—and the knowledge of her fault Would draggle his smooth time. But I, whose days Are not so fine they cannot bear the rain, And who moreover having seen her face Must see it again, . . . will see it, by my hopes Of one day seeing heaven too. The police Shall track her, hound her, ferret their own soil; We'll dig this Paris to its catacombs But certainly we'll find her, have her out, And save her, if she will or will not—child Or no child,—if a child, then one to save! The long weeks passed on without consequence. As easy find a footstep on the sand The morning after spring-tide, as the trace Of Marian's feet between the incessant surfs Of this live flood. She may have moved this way,— But so the star-fish does, and crosses out The dent of her small shoe. The foiled police Renounced me. “Could they find a girl and child, No other signalment but girl and child? No data shown but noticeable eyes And hair in masses, low upon the brow, As if it were an iron crown and pressed? Friends heighten, and suppose they specify: Why, girls with hair and eyes are everywhere In Paris; they had turned me up in vain No Marian Erle indeed, but certainly Mathildes, Justines, Victoires, . . . or, if I sought The English, Betsis, Saras, by the score. They might as well go out into the fields To find a speckled bean, that's somehow specked, And somewhere in the pod.”—They left me so. Shall I leave Marian? have I dreamed a dream? —I thank God I have found her! I must say “Thank God,” for finding her, although 'tis true I find the world more sad and wicked for't. But she— I'll write about her, presently. My hand's a-tremble, as I had just caught up My heart to write with, in the place of it. At least you'd take these letters to be writ At sea, in storm!—wait now. . . . A simple chance Did all. I could not sleep last night, and, tired Of turning on my pillow and harder thoughts, Went out at early morning, when the air Is delicate with some last starry touch, To wander through the Market-place of Flowers (The prettiest haunt in Paris), and make sure At worst that there were roses in the world. So wandering, musing, with the artist's eye, That keeps the shade-side of the thing it loves, Half-absent, whole-observing, while the crowd Of young, vivacious, and black-braided heads Dipped, quick as finches in a blossomed tree, Among the nosegays, cheapening this and that In such a cheerful twitter of rapid speech,— My heart leapt in me, startled by a voice That slowly, faintly, with long breaths that marked The interval between the wish and word, Inquired in stranger's French, “Would that be much, That branch of flowering mountain-gorse?”—“So much? Too much for me, then!” turning the face round So close upon me that I felt the sigh It turned with. “Marian, Marian!”—face to face— “Marian! I find you. Shall I let you go?” I held her two slight wrists with both my hands; “Ah Marian, Marian, can I let you go?” —She fluttered from me like a cyclamen, As white, which taken in a sudden wind Beats on against the palisade.—“Let pass,” She said at last. “I will not,” I replied; “I lost my sister Marian many days, And sought her ever in my walks and prayers, And, now I find her . . . do we throw away The bread we worked and prayed for,—crumble it And drop it, . . . to do even so by thee Whom still I've hungered after more than bread, My sister Marian?—can I hurt thee, dear? Then why distrust me? Never tremble so. Come with me rather where we'll talk and live, And none shall vex us. I've a home for you And me and no one else.” . . . She shook her head. “A home for you and me and no one else Ill suits one of us: I prefer to such, A roof of grass on which a flower might spring, Less costly to me than the cheapest here; And yet I could not, at this hour, afford A like home even. That you offer yours, I thank you. You are good as heaven itself— As good as one I knew before. . . . Farewell.” I loosed her hands:—“In his name, no farewell!” (She stood as if I held her.) “For his sake, For his sake, Romney's! by the good he meant, Ay, always! by the love he pressed for once,— And by the grief, reproach, abandonment, He took in change” . . . “He?—Romney! who grieved him? Who had the heart for't? what reproach touched him? Be merciful,—speak quickly.” “Therefore come,” I answered with authority.—“I think We dare to speak such things and name such names In the open squares of Paris!” Not a word She said, but in a gentle humbled way (As one who had forgot herself in grief) Turned round and followed closely where I went, As if I led her by a narrow plank Across devouring waters, step by step; And so in silence we walked on a mile. And then she stopped: her face was white as wax. “We go much farther?” “You are ill,” I asked, “Or tired?” She looked the whiter for her smile. “There's one at home,” she said, “has need of me By this time,—and I must not let him wait.” “Not even,” I asked, “to hear of Romney Leigh?” “Not even,” she said, “to hear of Mister Leigh.” “In that case,” I resumed, “I go with you, And we can talk the same thing there as here. None waits for me: I have my day to spend.” Her lips moved in a spasm without a sound,— But then she spoke. “It shall be as you please; And better so—'tis shorter seen than told: And though you will not find me worth your pains, That, even, may be worth some pains to know For one as good as you are.” Then she led The way, and I, as by a narrow plank Across devouring waters, followed her, Stepping by her footsteps, breathing by her breath, And holding her with eyes that would not slip; And so, without a word, we walked a mile, And so, another mile, without a word. Until the peopled streets being all dismissed, House-rows and groups all scattered like a flock, The market-gardens thickened, and the long White walls beyond, like spiders' outside threads, Stretched, feeling blindly toward the country-fields, Through half-built habitations and half-dug Foundations,—intervals of trenchant chalk That bit betwixt the grassy uneven turfs Where goats (vine-tendrils trailing from their mouths) Stood perched on edges of the cellarage Which should be, staring as about to leap To find their coming Bacchus. All the place Seemed less a cultivation than a waste. Men work here, only,—scarce begin to live: All's sad, the country struggling with the town, Like an untamed hawk upon a strong man's fist, That beats its wings and tries to get away, And cannot choose be satisfied so soon To hop through court-yards with its right foot tied, The vintage plains and pastoral hills in sight. We stopped beside a house too high and slim To stand there by itself, but waiting till Five others, two on this side, three on that, Should grow up from the sullen second floor They pause at now, to build it to a row. The upper windows partly were unglazed Meantime,—a meagre, unripe house: a line Of rigid poplars elbowed it behind, And, just in front, beyond the lime and bricks That wronged the grass between it and the road, A great acacia with its slender trunk And overpoise of multitudinous leaves (In which a hundred fields might spill their dew And intense verdure, yet find room enough) Stood reconciling all the place with green. I followed up the stair upon her step. She hurried upward, shot across a face, A woman's, on the landing,—“How now, now! Is no one to have holidays but you? You said an hour, and stayed three hours, I think, And Julie waiting for your betters here? Why if he had waked he might have waked, for me.” —Just murmuring an excusing word, she passed And shut the rest out with the chamber-door, Myself shut in beside her. 'Twas a room Scarce larger than a grave, and near as bare; Two stools, a pallet-bed; I saw the room: A mouse could find no sort of shelter in't, Much less a greater secret; curtainless,— The window fixed you with its torturing eye, Defying you to take a step apart If peradventure you would hide a thing. I saw the whole room, I and Marian there Alone. Alone? She threw her bonnet off, Then, sighing as 'twere sighing the last time, Approached the bed, and drew a shawl away: You could not peel a fruit you fear to bruise More calmly and more carefully than so,— Nor would you find within, a rosier flushed Pomegranate— There he lay upon his back, The yearling creature, warm and moist with life To the bottom of his dimples,—to the ends Of the lovely tumbled curls about his face; For since he had been covered over-much To keep him from the light-glare, both his cheeks Were hot and scarlet as the first live rose The shepherd's heart-blood ebbed away into The faster for his love. And love was here As instant; in the pretty baby-mouth, Shut close as if for dreaming that it sucked, The little naked feet, drawn up the way Of nestled birdlings; everything so soft And tender,—to the tiny holdfast hands, Which, closing on a finger into sleep, Had kept the mould of't. While we stood there dumb, For oh, that it should take such innocence To prove just guilt, I thought, and stood there dumb,— The light upon his eyelids pricked them wide, And, staring out at us with all their blue, As half perplexed between the angelhood He had been away to visit in his sleep, And our most mortal presence, gradually He saw his mother's face, accepting it In change for heaven itself with such a smile As might have well been learnt there,—never moved, But smiled on, in a drowse of ecstasy, So happy (half with her and half with heaven) He could not have the trouble to be stirred, But smiled and lay there. Like a rose, I said? As red and still indeed as any rose, That blows in all the silence of its leaves, Content in blowing to fulfil its life. She leaned above him (drinking him as wine) In that extremity of love, 'twill pass For agony or rapture, seeing that love Includes the whole of nature, rounding it To love . . . no more,—since more can never be Than just love. Self-forgot, cast out of self, And drowning in the transport of the sight, Her whole pale passionate face, mouth, forehead, eyes, One gaze, she stood: then, slowly as he smiled She smiled too, slowly, smiling unaware, And drawing from his countenance to hers A fainter red, as if she watched a flame And stood in it a-glow. “How beautiful,” Said she. I answered, trying to be cold. (Must sin have compensations, was my thought, As if it were a holy thing like grief? And is a woman to be fooled aside From putting vice down, with that woman's toy A baby?)—“Ay! the child is well enough,” I answered. “If his mother's palms are clean They need be glad of course in clasping such; But if not, I would rather lay my hand, Were I she, on God's brazen altar-bars Red-hot with burning sacrificial lambs, Than touch the sacred curls of such a child.” She plunged her fingers in his clustering locks, As one who would not be afraid of fire; And then with indrawn steady utterance said, “My lamb, my lamb! although, through such as thou, The most unclean got courage and approach To God, once,—now they cannot, even with men, Find grace enough for pity and gentle words.” “My Marian,” I made answer, grave and sad, “The priest who stole a lamb to offer him, Was still a thief. And if a woman steals (Through God's own barrier-hedges of true love, Which fence out license in securing love) A child like this, that smiles so in her face, She is no mother, but a kidnapper, And he's a dismal orphan, not a son, Whom all her kisses cannot feed so full He will not miss hereafter a pure home To live in, a pure heart to lean against, A pure good mother's name and memory To hope by, when the world grows thick and bad And he feels out for virtue.” “Oh,” she smiled With bitter patience, “the child takes his chance; Not much worse off in being fatherless Than I was, fathered. He will say, belike, His mother was the saddest creature born; He'll say his mother lived so contrary To joy, that even the kindest, seeing her, Grew sometimes almost cruel: he'll not say She flew contrarious in the face of God With bat-wings of her vices. Stole my child,— My flower of earth, my only flower on earth, My sweet, my beauty!” . . . Up she snatched the child, And, breaking on him in a storm of tears, Drew out her long sobs from their shivering roots, Until he took it for a game, and stretched His feet and flapped his eager arms like wings And crowed and gurgled through his infant laugh: “Mine, mine,” she said. “I have as sure a right As any glad proud mother in the world, Who sets her darling down to cut his teeth Upon her church-ring. If she talks of law, I talk of law! I claim my mother-dues By law,—the law which now is paramount,— The common law, by which the poor and weak Are trodden underfoot by vicious men, And loathed for ever after by the good. Let pass! I did not filch,—I found the child.” “You found him, Marian?” “Ay, I found him where I found my curse,—in the gutter, with my shame! What have you, any of you, to say to that, Who all are happy, and sit safe and high, And never spoke before to arraign my right To grief itself? What, what, . . . being beaten down By hoofs of maddened oxen into a ditch, Half-dead, whole mangled, when a girl at last Breathes, sees . . . and finds there, bedded in her flesh Because of the extremity of the shock, Some coin of price! . . . and when a good man comes (That's God! the best men are not quite as good) And says ‘I dropped the coin there: take it you, And keep it,—it shall pay you for the loss,’— You all put up your finger—‘See the thief! ‘Observe what precious thing she has come to filch. ‘How bad those girls are!’ Oh, my flower, my pet, I dare forget I have you in my arms And fly off to be angry with the world, And fright you, hurt you with my tempers, till You double up your lip? Why, that indeed Is bad: a naughty mother!” “You mistake,” I interrupted; “if I loved you not, I should not, Marian, certainly be here.” “Alas,” she said, “you are so very good; And yet I wish indeed you had never come To make me sob until I vex the child. It is not wholesome for these pleasure-plats To be so early watered by our brine. And then, who knows? he may not like me now As well, perhaps, as ere he saw me fret,— One's ugly fretting! he has eyes the same As angels, but he cannot see as deep, And so I've kept for ever in his sight A sort of smile to please him,—as you place A green thing from the garden in a cup, To make believe it grows there. Look, my sweet, My cowslip-ball! we've done with that cross face, And here's the face come back you used to like. Ah, ah! he laughs! he likes me. Ah, Miss Leigh, You're great and pure; but were you purer still,— As if you had walked, we'll say, no otherwhere Than up and down the New Jerusalem, And held your trailing lutestring up yourself From brushing the twelve stones, for fear of some Small speck as little as a needle-prick, White stitched on white,—the child would keep to me, Would choose his poor lost Marian, like me best, And, though you stretched your arms, cry back and cling, As we do when God says it's time to die And bids us go up higher. Leave us, then; We two are happy. Does he push me off? He's satisfied with me, as I with him.” “So soft to one, so hard to others! Nay,” I cried, more angry that she melted me, “We make henceforth a cushion of our faults To sit and practise easy virtues on? I thought a child was given to sanctify A woman,—set her in the sight of all The clear-eyed heavens, a chosen minister To do their business and lead spirits up The difficult blue heights. A woman lives, Not bettered, quickened toward the truth and good Through being a mother? . . . then she's none! although She damps her baby's cheeks by kissing them, As we kill roses.” “Kill! O Christ,” she said, And turned her wild sad face from side to side With most despairing wonder in it, “What, What have you in your souls against me then, All of you? am I wicked, do you think? God knows me, trusts me with the child; but you, You think me really wicked?” “Complaisant,” I answered softly, “to a wrong you've done, Because of certain profits,—which is wrong Beyond the first wrong, Marian. When you left The pure place and the noble heart, to take The hand of a seducer” . . . “Whom? whose hand? I took the hand of” . . . Springing up erect, And lifting up the child at full arm's length, As if to bear him like an oriflamme Unconquerable to armies of reproach,— “By him,” she said, “my child's head and its curls, By these blue eyes no woman born could dare A perjury on, I make my mother's oath, That if I left that Heart, to lighten it, The blood of mine was still, except for grief! No cleaner maid than I was took a step To a sadder end,—no matron-mother now Looks backward to her early maidenhood Through chaster pulses. I speak steadily; And if I lie so, . . . if, being fouled in will And paltered with in soul by devil's lust, I dared to bid this angel take my part, . . . Would God sit quiet, let us think, in heaven, Nor strike me dumb with thunder? Yet I speak: He clears me therefore. What, ‘seduced’ 's your word! Do wolves seduce a wandering fawn in France? Do eagles, who have pinched a lamb with claws, Seduce it into carrion? So with me. I was not ever, as you say, seduced, But simply, murdered.” There she paused, and sighed With such a sigh as drops from agony To exhaustion,—sighing while she let the babe Slide down upon her bosom from her arms, And all her face's light fell after him Like a torch quenched in falling. Down she sank, And sat upon the bedside with the child. But I, convicted, broken utterly, With woman's passion clung about her waist And kissed her hair and eyes,—“I have been wrong, Sweet Marian” . . . (weeping in a tender rage) . . . “Sweet holy Marian! And now, Marian, now, I'll use your oath although my lips are hard, And by the child, my Marian, by the child, I swear his mother shall be innocent Before my conscience, as in the open Book Of Him who reads for judgment. Innocent, My sister! let the night be ne'er so dark The moon is surely somewhere in the sky; So surely is your whiteness to be found Through all dark facts. But pardon, pardon me, And smile a little, Marian,—for the child, If not for me, my sister.” The poor lip Just motioned for the smile and let it go: And then, with scarce a stirring of the mouth, As if a statue spoke that could not breathe, But spoke on calm between its marble lips,— “I'm glad, I'm very glad you clear me so. I should be sorry that you set me down With harlots, or with even a better name Which misbecomes his mother. For the rest, I am not on a level with your love, Nor ever was, you know,—but now am worse, Because that world of yours has dealt with me As when the hard sea bites and chews a stone And changes the first form of it. I've marked A shore of pebbles bitten to one shape From all the various life of madrepores; And so, that little stone, called Marian Erle, Picked up and dropped by you and another friend, Was ground and tortured by the incessant sea And bruised from what she was,—changed! death's a change, And she, I said, was murdered; Marian's dead. What can you do with people when they are dead But, if you are pious, sing a hymn and go; Or, if you are tender, heave a sigh and go; But go by all means,—and permit the grass To keep its green feud up 'twixt them and you? Then leave me,—let me rest. I'm dead, I say, And if, to save the child from death as well, The mother in me has survived the rest, Why, that's God's miracle you must not tax, I'm not less dead for that: I'm nothing more But just a mother. Only for the child I'm warm, and cold, and hungry, and afraid, And smell the flowers a little and see the sun, And speak still, and am silent,—just for him! I pray you therefore to mistake me not And treat me haply as I were alive; For though you ran a pin into my soul, I think it would not hurt nor trouble me. Here's proof, dear lady,—in the market-place But now, you promised me to say a word About . . . a friend, who once, long years ago, Took God's place toward me, when He leans and loves And does not thunder, . . . whom at last I left, As all of us leave God. You thought perhaps I seemed to care for hearing of that friend? Now, judge me! we have sat here half an hour And talked together of the child and me, And I not asked as much as ‘What's the thing ‘You had to tell me of the friend . . . the friend?’ He's sad, I think you said,—he's sick perhaps? 'Tis nought to Marian if he's sad or sick. Another would have crawled beside your foot And prayed your words out. Why, a beast, a dog, A starved cat, if he had fed it once with milk, Would show less hardness. But I'm dead, you see, And that explains it.” Poor, poor thing, she spoke And shook her head, as white and calm as frost On days too cold for raining any more, But still with such a face, so much alive, I could not choose but take it on my arm And stroke the placid patience of its cheeks,— Then told my story out, of Romney Leigh, How, having lost her, sought her, missed her still, He, broken-hearted for himself and her, Had drawn the curtains of the world awhile As if he had done with morning. There I stopped, For when she gasped, and pressed me with her eyes, “And now . . . how is it with him? tell me now,” I felt the shame of compensated grief, And chose my words with scruple—slowly stepped Upon the slippery stones set here and there Across the sliding water. “Certainly, As evening empties morning into night, Another morning takes the evening up With healthful, providential interchange; And, though he thought still of her—” “Yes, she knew, She understood: she had supposed indeed That, as one stops a hole upon a flute, At which a new note comes and shapes the tune, Excluding her would bring a worthier in, And, long ere this, that Lady Waldemar He loved so” . . . “Loved,” I started,—“loved her so! Now tell me” . . . “I will tell you,” she replied: “But, since we're taking oaths, you'll promise first That he in England, he, shall never learn In what a dreadful trap his creature here, Round whose unworthy neck he had meant to tie The honourable ribbon of his name, Fell unaware and came to butchery: Because,—I know him,—as he takes to heart The grief of every stranger, he's not like To banish mine as far as I should choose In wishing him most happy. Now he leaves To think of me, perverse, who went my way, Unkind, and left him,—but if once he knew . . . Ah, then, the sharp nail of my cruel wrong Would fasten me for ever in his sight, Like some poor curious bird, through each spread wing Nailed high up over a fierce hunter's fire, To spoil the dinner of all tenderer folk Come in by chance. Nay, since your Marian's dead, You shall not hang her up, but dig a hole And bury her in silence! ring no bells.” I answered gaily, though my whole voice wept, “We'll ring the joy-bells, not the funeral-bells, Because we have her back, dead or alive.” She never answered that, but shook her head; Then low and calm, as one who, safe in heaven, Shall tell a story of his lower life, Unmoved by shame or anger,—so she spoke. She told me she had loved upon her knees, As others pray, more perfectly absorbed In the act and inspiration. She felt his For just his uses, not her own at all,— His stool, to sit on or put up his foot, His cup, to fill with wine or vinegar, Whichever drink might please him at the chance, For that should please her always: let him write His name upon her . . . it seemed natural; It was most precious, standing on his shelf, To wait until he chose to lift his hand. Well, well,—I saw her then, and must have seen How bright her life went floating on her love, Like wicks the housewives send afloat on oil Which feeds them to a flame that lasts the night. To do good seemed so much his business, That, having done it, she was fain to think, Must fill up his capacity for joy. At first she never mooted with herself If he was happy, since he made her so, Or if he loved her, being so much beloved. Who thinks of asking if the sun is light, Observing that it lightens? who's so bold To question God of His felicity? Still less. And thus she took for granted first What first of all she should have put to proof, And sinned against him so, but only so. “What could you hope,” she said, “of such as she? You take a kid you like, and turn it out In some fair garden: though the creature's fond And gentle, it will leap upon the beds And break your tulips, bite your tender trees; The wonder would be if such innocence Spoiled less: a garden is no place for kids.” And, by degrees, when he who had chosen her Brought in his courteous and benignant friends To spend their goodness on her, which she took So very gladly, as a part of his,— By slow degrees it broke on her slow sense That she too in that Eden of delight Was out of place, and, like the silly kid, Still did most mischief where she meant most love. A thought enough to make a woman mad (No beast in this but she may well go mad), That saying “I am thine to love and use” May blow the plague in her protesting breath To the very man for whom she claims to die,— That, clinging round his neck, she pulls him down And drowns him,—and that, lavishing her soul, She hales perdition on him. “So, being mad,” Said Marian . . . “Ah—who stirred such thoughts,you ask? Whose fault it was, that she should have such thoughts? None's fault, none's fault. The light comes, and we see: But if it were not truly for our eyes, There would be nothing seen, for all the light. And so with Marian: if she saw at last, The sense was in her,—Lady Waldemar Had spoken all in vain else.” “O my heart, O prophet in my heart,” I cried aloud, “Then Lady Waldemar spoke!” “Did she speak,” Mused Marian softly, “or did she only sign? Or did she put a word into her face And look, and so impress you with the word? Or leave it in the foldings of her gown, Like rosemary smells a movement will shake out When no one's conscious? who shall say, or guess? One thing alone was certain—from the day The gracious lady paid a visit first, She, Marian, saw things different,—felt distrust Of all that sheltering roof of circumstance Her hopes were building into with clay nests: Her heart was restless, pacing up and down And fluttering, like dumb creatures before storms, Not knowing wherefore she was ill at ease.” “And still the lady came,” said Marian Erle, “Much oftener than he knew it, Mister Leigh. She bade me never tell him she had come, She liked to love me better than he knew, So very kind was Lady Waldemar: And every time she brought with her more light, And every light made sorrow clearer . . . Well, Ah, well! we cannot give her blame for that; 'Twould be the same thing if an angel came, Whose right should prove our wrong. And every time The lady came, she looked more beautiful And spoke more like a flute among green trees, Until at last, as one, whose heart being sad On hearing lovely music, suddenly Dissolves in weeping, I brake out in tears Before her, asked her counsel,—‘Had I erred ‘In being too happy? would she set me straight? ‘For she, being wise and good and born above ‘The flats I had never climbed from, could perceive ‘If such as I might grow upon the hills; ‘And whether such poor herb sufficed to grow, ‘For Romney Leigh to break his fast upon't,— ‘Or would he pine on such, or haply starve?’ She wrapped me in her generous arms at once, And let me dream a moment how it feels To have a real mother, like some girls: But when I looked, her face was younger . . . ay, Youth's too bright not to be a little hard, And beauty keeps itself still uppermost, That's true!—Though Lady Waldemar was kind She hurt me, hurt, as if the morning-sun Should smite us on the eyelids when we sleep, And wake us up with headache. Ay, and soon Was light enough to make my heart ache too: She told me truths I asked for,—'twas my fault,— ‘That Romney could not love me, if he would, ‘As men call loving: there are bloods that flow ‘Together like some rivers and not mix, ‘Through contraries of nature. He indeed ‘Was set to wed me, to espouse my class, ‘Act out a rash opinion,—and, once wed, ‘So just a man and gentle could not choose ‘But make my life as smooth as marriage-ring, ‘Bespeak me mildly, keep me a cheerful house, ‘With servants, brooches, all the flowers I liked, ‘And pretty dresses, silk the whole year round’ . . . At which I stopped her,—‘This for me. And now ‘For him.’—She hesitated,—truth grew hard; She owned ‘'Twas plain a man like Romney Leigh ‘Required a wife more level to himself. ‘If day by day he had to bend his height ‘To pick up sympathies, opinions, thoughts, ‘And interchange the common talk of life ‘Which helps a man to live as well as talk, ‘His days were heavily taxed. Who buys a staff ‘To fit the hand, that reaches but the knee? ‘He'd feel it bitter to be forced to miss ‘The perfect joy of married suited pairs, ‘Who, bursting through the separating hedge ‘Of personal dues with that sweet eglantine ‘Of equal love, keep saying, “So we think, ‘“It strikes us,—that's our fancy.”’—When I asked If earnest will, devoted love, employed In youth like mine, would fail to raise me up As two strong arms will always raise a child To a fruit hung overhead, she sighed and sighed . . . ‘That could not be,’ she feared. ‘You take a pink, ‘You dig about its roots and water it ‘And so improve it to a garden-pink, ‘But will not change it to a heliotrope, ‘The kind remains. And then, the harder truth— ‘This Romney Leigh, so rash to leap a pale, ‘So bold for conscience, quick for martyrdom, ‘Would suffer steadily and never flinch, ‘But suffer surely and keenly, when his class ‘Turned shoulder on him for a shameful match, ‘And set him up as nine-pin in their talk ‘To bowl him down with jestings.’—There, she paused. And when I used the pause in doubting that We wronged him after all in what we feared— ‘Suppose such things could never touch him more ‘In his high conscience (if the things should be) ‘Than, when the queen sits in an upper room, ‘The horses in the street can spatter her!’— A moment, hope came,—but the lady closed That door and nicked the lock and shut it out, Observing wisely that ‘the tender heart ‘Which made him over-soft to a lower class, ‘Would scarcely fail to make him sensitive ‘To a higher,—how they thought and what they felt.’ “Alas, alas!” said Marian, rocking slow The pretty baby who was near asleep, The eyelids creeping over the blue balls,— “She made it clear, too clear—I saw the whole! And yet who knows if I had seen my way Straight out of it by looking, though 'twas clear, Unless the generous lady, 'ware of this, Had set her own house all a-fire for me To light me forwards? Leaning on my face Her heavy agate eyes which crushed my will, She told me tenderly (as when men come To a bedside to tell people they must die), ‘She knew of knowledge,—ay, of knowledge knew, ‘That Romney Leigh had loved her formerly. ‘And she loved him, she might say, now the chance ‘Was past,—but that, of course, he never guessed,— ‘For something came between them, something thin ‘As a cobweb, catching every fly of doubt ‘To hold it buzzing at the window-pane ‘And help to dim the daylight. Ah, man's pride ‘Or woman's—which is greatest? most averse ‘To brushing cobwebs? Well, but she and he ‘Remained fast friends; it seemed not more than so, ‘Because he had bound his hands and could not stir. ‘An honourable man, if somewhat rash; ‘And she, not even for Romney, would she spill ‘A blot . . . as little even as a tear . . . ‘Upon his marriage-contract,—not to gain ‘A better joy for two than came by that: ‘For, though I stood between her heart and heaven, ‘She loved me wholly.’” Did I laugh or curse? I think I sat there silent, hearing all, Ay, hearing double,—Marian's tale, at once, And Romney's marriage vow, “I'll keep to thee,” Which means that woman-serpent. Is it time For church now? “Lady Waldemar spoke more,” Continued Marian, “but, as when a soul Will pass out through the sweetness of a song Beyond it, voyaging the uphill road, Even so mine wandered from the things I heard To those I suffered. It was afterward I shaped the resolution to the act. For many hours we talked. What need to talk? The fate was clear and close; it touched my eyes; But still the generous lady tried to keep The case afloat, and would not let it go, And argued, struggled upon Marian's side, Which was not Romney's! though she little knew What ugly monster would take up the end,— What griping death within the drowning death Was ready to complete my sum of death.” I thought,—Perhaps he's sliding now the ring Upon that woman's finger . . . She went on: “The lady, failing to prevail her way, Upgathered my torn wishes from the ground And pieced them with her strong benevolence; And, as I thought I could breathe freer air Away from England, going without pause, Without farewell, just breaking with a jerk The blossomed offshoot from my thorny life,— She promised kindly to provide the means, With instant passage to the colonies And full protection,—‘would commit me straight ‘To one who once had been her waiting-maid ‘And had the customs of the world, intent ‘On changing England for Australia ‘Herself, to carry out her fortune so.’ For which I thanked the Lady Waldemar, As men upon their death-beds thank last friends Who lay the pillow straight: it is not much, And yet 'tis all of which they are capable, This lying smoothly in a bed to die. And so, 'twas fixed;—and so, from day to day, The woman named came in to visit me.” Just then the girl stopped speaking,—sat erect, And stared at me as if I had been a ghost (Perhaps I looked as white as any ghost), With large-eyed horror. “Does God make,” she said, “All sorts of creatures really, do you think? Or is it that the Devil slavers them So excellently, that we come to doubt Who's stronger, He who makes, or he who mars? I never liked the woman's face or voice Or ways: it made me blush to look at her; It made me tremble if she touched my hand; And when she spoke a fondling word I shrank As if one hated me who had power to hurt; And, every time she came, my veins ran cold As somebody were walking on my grave. At last I spoke to Lady Waldemar: ‘Could such an one be good to trust?’ I asked. Whereat the lady stroked my cheek and laughed Her silver-laugh (one must be born to laugh, To put such music in it),—‘Foolish girl, ‘Your scattered wits are gathering wool beyond ‘The sheep-walk reaches!—leave the thing to me.’ And therefore, half in trust, and half in scorn That I had heart still for another fear In such a safe despair, I left the thing. “The rest is short. I was obedient: I wrote my letter which delivered him From Marian to his own prosperities, And followed that bad guide. The lady?—hush, I never blame the lady. Ladies who Sit high, however willing to look down, Will scarce see lower than their dainty feet; And Lady Waldemar saw less than I With what a Devil's daughter I went forth Along the swine's road, down the precipice, In such a curl of hell-foam caught and choked, No shriek of soul in anguish could pierce through To fetch some help. They say there's help in heaven For all such cries. But if one cries from hell . . . What then?—the heavens are deaf upon that side. “A woman . . . hear me, let me make it plain, . . . A woman . . . not a monster . . . both her breasts Made right to suckle babes . . . she took me off A woman also, young and ignorant And heavy with my grief, my two poor eyes Near washed away with weeping, till the trees, The blessed unaccustomed trees and fields Ran either side the train like stranger dogs Unworthy of any notice,—took me off So dull, so blind, so only half-alive, Not seeing by what road, nor by what ship, Nor toward what place, nor to what end of all. Men carry a corpse thus,—past the doorway, past The garden-gate, the children's playground, up The green lane,—then they leave it in the pit, To sleep and find corruption, cheek to cheek With him who stinks since Friday. “But suppose; To go down with one's soul into the grave, To go down half-dead, half-alive, I say, And wake up with corruption, . . . cheek to cheek With him who stinks since Friday! There it is, And that's the horror of't, Miss Leigh. “You feel? You understand?—no, do not look at me, But understand. The blank, blind, weary way, Which led, where'er it led, away at least; The shifted ship, to Sydney or to France, Still bound, wherever else, to another land; The swooning sickness on the dismal sea, The foreign shore, the shameful house, the night, The feeble blood, the heavy-headed grief, . . . No need to bring their damnable drugged cup, And yet they brought it. Hell's so prodigal Of devil's gifts, hunts liberally in packs, Will kill no poor small creature of the wilds But fifty red wide throats must smoke at it, As his at me . . . when waking up at last . . . I told you that I waked up in the grave. “Enough so!—it is plain enough so. True, We wretches cannot tell out all our wrong Without offence to decent happy folk. I know that we must scrupulously hint With half-words, delicate reserves, the thing Which no one scrupled we should feel in full. Let pass the rest, then; only leave my oath Upon this sleeping child,—man's violence, Not man's seduction, made me what I am, As lost as . . . I told him I should be lost. When mothers fail us, can we help ourselves? That's fatal!—And you call it being lost, That down came next day's noon and caught me there, Half-gibbering and half-raving on the floor, And wondering what had happened up in heaven, That suns should dare to shine when God Himself Was certainly abolished. “I was mad, How many weeks, I know not,—many weeks. I think they let me go when I was mad, They feared my eyes and loosed me, as boys might A mad dog which they had tortured. Up and down I went, by road and village, over tracts Of open foreign country, large and strange, Crossed everywhere by long thin poplar-lines Like fingers of some ghastly skeleton Hand Through sunlight and through moonlight evermore Pushed out from hell itself to pluck me back, And resolute to get me, slow and sure; While every roadside Christ upon his cross Hung reddening through his gory wounds at me, And shook his nails in anger, and came down To follow a mile after, wading up The low vines and green wheat, crying ‘Take the girl! ‘She's none of mine from henceforth.’ Then I knew (But this is somewhat dimmer than the rest) The charitable peasants gave me bread And leave to sleep in straw: and twice they tied, At parting, Mary's image round my neck— How heavy it seemed! as heavy as a stone; A woman has been strangled with less weight: I threw it in a ditch to keep it clean And ease my breath a little, when none looked; I did not need such safeguards:—brutal men Stopped short, Miss Leigh, in insult, when they had seen My face,—I must have had an awful look. And so I lived: the weeks passed on,—I lived. 'Twas living my old tramp-life o'er again, But, this time, in a dream, and hunted round By some prodigious Dream-fear at my back, Which ended yet: my brain cleared presently; And there I sat, one evening, by the road, I, Marian Erle, myself, alone, undone, Facing a sunset low upon the flats As if it were the finish of all time, The great red stone upon my sepulchre, Which angels were too weak to roll away. SEVENTH BOOK. “The woman's motive? shall we daub ourselves With finding roots for nettles? 'tis soft clay And easily explored. She had the means, The moneys, by the lady's liberal grace, In trust for that Australian scheme and me, Which so, that she might clutch with both her hands And chink to her naughty uses undisturbed, She served me (after all it was not strange, 'Twas only what my mother would have done) A motherly, right damnable good turn. “Well, after. There are nettles everywhere, But smooth green grasses are more common still; The blue of heaven is larger than the cloud; A miller's wife at Clichy took me in And spent her pity on me,—made me calm And merely very reasonably sad. She found me a servant's place in Paris, where I tried to take the cast-off life again, And stood as quiet as a beaten ass Who, having fallen through overloads, stands up To let them charge him with another pack. “A few months, so. My mistress, young and light, Was easy with me, less for kindness than Because she led, herself, an easy time Betwixt her lover and her looking-glass, Scarce knowing which way she was praised the most. She felt so pretty and so pleased all day She could not take the trouble to be cross, But sometimes, as I stooped to tie her shoe, Would tap me softly with her slender foot Still restless with the last night's dancing in't, And say ‘Fie, pale-face! are you English girls ‘All grave and silent? mass-book still, and Lent? ‘And first-communion pallor on your cheeks, ‘Worn past the time for't? little fool, be gay!’ At which she vanished like a fairy, through A gap of silver laughter. “Came an hour When all went otherwise. She did not speak, But clenched her brows, and clipped me with her eyes As if a viper with a pair of tongs, Too far for any touch, yet near enough To view the writhing creature,—then at last, ‘Stand still there, in the holy Virgin's name, ‘Thou Marian; thou'rt no reputable girl, ‘Although sufficient dull for twenty saints! ‘I think thou mock'st me and my house,’ she said; ‘Confess thou'lt be a mother in a month, ‘Thou mask of saintship.’ “Could I answer her? The light broke in so. It meant that then, that? I had not thought of that, in all my thoughts, Through all the cold, numb aching of my brow, Through all the heaving of impatient life Which threw me on death at intervals,—through all The upbreak of the fountains of my heart The rains had swelled too large: it could mean that? Did God make mothers out of victims, then, And set such pure amens to hideous deeds? Why not? He overblows an ugly grave With violets which blossom in the spring. And I could be a mother in a month? I hope it was not wicked to be glad. I lifted up my voice and wept, and laughed, To heaven, not her, until it tore my throat. ‘Confess, confess!’—what was there to confess, Except man's cruelty, except my wrong? Except this anguish, or this ecstasy? This shame or glory? The light woman there Was small to take it in: an acorn-cup Would take the sea in sooner. “‘Good,’ she cried; ‘Unmarried and a mother, and she laughs! ‘These unchaste girls are always impudent. ‘Get out, intriguer! leave my house and trot. ‘I wonder you should look me in the face, ‘With such a filthy secret.’ “Then I rolled My scanty bundle up and went my way, Washed white with weeping, shuddering head and foot With blind hysteric passion, staggering forth Beyond those doors. 'Twas natural of course She should not ask me where I meant to sleep; I might sleep well beneath the heavy Seine, Like others of my sort; the bed was laid For us. But any woman, womanly, Had thought of him who should be in a month, The sinless babe that should be in a month, And if by chance he might be warmer housed Than underneath such dreary dripping eaves.” I broke on Marian there. “Yet she herself, A wife, I think, had scandals of her own,— A lover not her husband.” “Ay,” she said, “But gold and meal are measured otherwise; I learnt so much at school,” said Marian Erle. “O crooked world,” I cried, “ridiculous If not so lamentable! 'Tis the way With these light women of a thrifty vice, My Marian,—always hard upon the rent In any sister's virtue! while they keep Their own so darned and patched with perfidy, That, though a rag itself, it looks as well Across a street, in balcony or coach, As any perfect stuff might. For my part, I'd rather take the wind-side of the stews Than touch such women with my finger-end! They top the poor street-walker by their lie And look the better for being so much worse: The devil's most devilish when respectable. But you, dear, and your story.” “All the rest Is here,” she said, and signed upon the child. “I found a mistress-sempstress who was kind And let me sew in peace among her girls. And what was better than to draw the threads All day and half the night for him and him? And so I lived for him, and so he lives, And so I know, by this time, God lives too.” She smiled beyond the sun and ended so, And all my soul rose up to take her part Against the world's successes, virtues, fames. “Come with me, sweetest sister,” I returned, “And sit within my house and do me good From henceforth, thou and thine! ye are my own From henceforth. I am lonely in the world, And thou art lonely, and the child is half An orphan. Come,—and henceforth thou and I Being still together will not miss a friend, Nor he a father, since two mothers shall Make that up to him. I am journeying south, And in my Tuscan home I'll find a niche And set thee there, my saint, the child and thee, And burn the lights of love before thy face, And ever at thy sweet look cross myself From mixing with the world's prosperities; That so, in gravity and holy calm, We two may live on toward the truer life.” She looked me in the face and answered not, Nor signed she was unworthy, nor gave thanks, But took the sleeping child and held it out To meet my kiss, as if requiting me And trusting me at once. And thus, at once, I carried him and her to where I live; She's there now, in the little room, asleep, I hear the soft child-breathing through the door, And all three of us, at to-morrow's break, Pass onward, homeward, to our Italy. Oh, Romney Leigh, I have your debts to pay, And I'll be just and pay them. But yourself! To pay your debts is scarcely difficult, To buy your life is nearly impossible, Being sold away to Lamia. My head aches, I cannot see my road along this dark; Nor can I creep and grope, as fits the dark, For these foot-catching robes of womanhood: A man might walk a little . . . but I!—He loves The Lamia-woman,—and I, write to him What stops his marriage, and destroys his peace,— Or what perhaps shall simply trouble him, Until she only need to touch his sleeve With just a finger's tremulous white flame, Saying “Ah,—Aurora Leigh! a pretty tale, “A very pretty poet! I can guess “The motive”—then, to catch his eye in hers And vow she does not wonder,—and they two To break in laughter as the sea along A melancholy coast, and float up higher, In such a laugh, their fatal weeds of love! Ay, fatal, ay. And who shall answer me Fate has not hurried tides,—and if to-night My letter would not be a night too late, An arrow shot into a man that's dead, To prove a vain intention? Would I show The new wife vile, to make the husband mad? No, Lamia! shut the shutters, bar the doors From every glimmer on thy serpent-skin! I will not let thy hideous secret out To agonise the man I love—I mean The friend I love . . . as friends love. It is strange, To-day while Marian told her story like To absorb most listeners, how I listened chief To a voice not hers, nor yet that enemy's, Nor God's in wrath, . . . but one that mixed with mine Long years ago among the garden-trees, And said to me, to me too, “Be my wife, Aurora.” It is strange with what a swell Of yearning passion, as a snow of ghosts Might beat against the impervious door of heaven, I thought, “Now, if I had been a woman, such As God made women, to save men by love,— By just my love I might have saved this man, And made a nobler poem for the world Than all I have failed in.” But I failed besides In this; and now he's lost! through me alone! And, by my only fault, his empty house Sucks in, at this same hour, a wind from hell To keep his hearth cold, make his casements creak For ever to the tune of plague and sin— O Romney, O my Romney, O my friend, My cousin and friend! my helper, when I would, My love, that might be! mine! Why, how one weeps When one's too weary! Were a witness by, He'd say some folly . . . that I loved the man, Who knows? . . . and make me laugh again for scorn. At strongest, women are as weak in flesh, As men, at weakest, vilest, are in soul: So, hard for women to keep pace with men! As well give up at once, sit down at once, And weep as I do. Tears, tears! why we weep? 'Tis worth inquiry?—that we've shamed a life, Or lost a love, or missed a world, perhaps? By no means. Simply, that we've walked too far, Or talked too much, or felt the wind i' the east,— And so we weep, as if both body and soul Broke up in water—this way. Poor mixed rags Forsooth we're made of, like those other dolls That lean with pretty faces into fairs. It seems as if I had a man in me, Despising such a woman. Yet indeed, To see a wrong or suffering moves us all To undo it though we should undo ourselves, Ay, all the more, that we undo ourselves; That's womanly, past doubt, and not ill-moved. A natural movement therefore, on my part, To fill the chair up of my cousin's wife, And save him from a devil's company! We're all so,—made so—'tis our woman's trade To suffer torment for another's ease. The world's male chivalry has perished out, But women are knights-errant to the last; And if Cervantes had been Shakespeare too, He had made his Don a Donna. So it clears, And so we rain our skies blue. Put away This weakness. If, as I have just now said, A man's within me,—let him act himself, Ignoring the poor conscious trouble of blood That's called the woman merely. I will write Plain words to England,—if too late, too late, If ill-accounted, then accounted ill; We'll trust the heavens with something. “Dear Lord Howe, You'll find a story on another leaf Of Marian Erle,—what noble friend of yours She trusted once, through what flagitious means, To what disastrous ends;—the story's true. I found her wandering on the Paris quays, A babe upon her breast,—unnatural, Unseasonable outcast on such snow Unthawed to this time. I will tax in this Your friendship, friend, if that convicted She Be not his wife yet, to denounce the facts To himself,—but, otherwise, to let them pass On tip-toe like escaping murderers, And tell my cousin merely—Marian lives, Is found, and finds her home with such a friend, Myself, Aurora. Which good news, ‘She's found,’ Will help to make him merry in his love: I send it, tell him, for my marriage-gift, As good as orange-water for the nerves, Or perfumed gloves for headache,—though aware That he, except of love, is scarcely sick: I mean the new love this time, . . . since last year. Such quick forgetting on the part of men! Is any shrewder trick upon the cards To enrich them? pray instruct me how 'tis done: First, clubs,—and while you look at clubs, 'tis spades; That's prodigy. The lightning strikes a man, And when we think to find him dead and charred . . . Why, there he is on a sudden, playing pipes Beneath the splintered elm-tree! Crime and shame And all their hoggery trample your smooth world, Nor leave more foot-marks than Apollo's kine Whose hoofs were muffled by the thieving god In tamarisk-leaves and myrtle. I'm so sad, So weary and sad to-night, I'm somewhat sour,— Forgive me. To be blue and shrew at once Exceeds all toleration except yours, But yours, I know, is infinite. Farewell. To-morrow we take train for Italy. Speak gently of me to your gracious wife, As one, however far, shall yet be near In loving wishes to your house.” I sign. And now I loose my heart upon a page, This— “Lady Waldemar, I'm very glad I never liked you; which you knew so well You spared me, in your turn, to like me much: Your liking surely had done worse for me Than has your loathing, though the last appears Sufficiently unscrupulous to hurt, And not afraid of judgment. Now, there's space Between our faces,—I stand off, as if I judged a stranger's portrait and pronounced Indifferently the type was good or bad. What matter to me that the lines are false, I ask you? did I ever ink my lips By drawing your name through them as a friend's, Or touch your hands as lovers do? Thank God I never did: and since you're proved so vile, Ay, vile, I say,—we'll show it presently,— I'm not obliged to nurse my friend in you, Or wash out my own blots, in counting yours, Or even excuse myself to honest souls Who seek to press my lip or clasp my palm,— ‘Alas, but Lady Waldemar came first!’ “'Tis true, by this time you may near me so That you're my cousin's wife. You've gambled deep As Lucifer, and won the morning-star In that case,—and the noble house of Leigh Must henceforth with its good roof shelter you: I cannot speak and burn you up between Those rafters, I who am born a Leigh,—nor speak And pierce your breast through Romney's, I who live, His friend and cousin,—so, you're safe. You two Mus grow together like the tares and wheat Till God's great fire.—But make the best of time. “And hide this letter: let it speak no more Than I shall, how you tricked poor Marian Erle, And set her own love digging its own grave Within her green hope's pretty garden-ground,— Ay, sent her forth with some one of your sort To a wicked house in France, from which she fled With curses in her eyes and ears and throat, Her whole soul choked with curses,—mad in short, And madly scouring up and down for weeks The foreign hedgeless country, lone and lost,— So innocent, male-fiends might slink within Remote hell-corners, seeing her so defiled. “But you,—you are a woman and more bold. To do you justice, you'd not shrink to face . . . We'll say, the unfledged life in the other room, Which, treading down God's corn, you trod in sight Of all the dogs, in reach of all the guns,— Ay, Marian's babe, her poor unfathered child, Her yearling babe!—you'd face him when he wakes And opens up his wonderful blue eyes: You'd meet them and not wink perhaps, nor fear God's triumph in them and supreme revenge When righting His creation's balance-scale (You pulled as low as Tophet) to the top Of most celestial innocence. For me, Who am not as bold, I own those infant eyes Have set me praying. “While they look at heaven, No need of protestation in my words Against the place you've made them! let them look. They'll do your business with the heavens, be sure: I spare you common curses. “Ponder this; If haply you're the wife of Romney Leigh (For which inheritance beyond your birth You sold that poisonous porridge called your soul), I charge you, be his faithful and true wife! Keep warm his hearth and clean his board, and, when He speaks, be quick with your obedience; Still grind your paltry wants and low desires To dust beneath his heel; though, even thus, The ground must hurt him,—it was writ of old, ‘Ye shall not yoke together ox and ass,’ The nobler and ignobler. Ay, but you Shall do your part as well as such ill things Can do aught good. You shall not vex him,—mark, You shall not vex him, jar him when he's sad, Or cross him when he's eager. Understand To trick him with apparent sympathies, Nor let him see thee in the face too near And unlearn thy sweet seeming. Pay the price Of lies, by being constrained to lie on still: 'Tis easy for thy sort: a million more Will scarcely damn thee deeper. “Doing which You are very safe from Marian and myself; We'll breathe as softly as the infant here, And stir no dangerous embers. Fail a point, And show our Romney wounded, ill-content, Tormented in his home, we open mouth, And such a noise will follow, the last trump's Will scarcely seem more dreadful, even to you; You'll have no pipers after: Romney will (I know him) push you forth as none of his, All other men declaring it well done, While women, even the worst, your like, will draw Their skirts back, not to brush you in the street, And so I warn you. I'm . . . Aurora Leigh.” The letter written, I felt satisfied. The ashes, smouldering in me, were thrown out By handfuls from me: I had writ my heart And wept my tears, and now was cool and calm; And, going straightway to the neighbouring room, I lifted up the curtains of the bed Where Marian Erle, the babe upon her arm, Both faces leaned together like a pair Of folded innocences self-complete, Each smiling from the other, smiled and slept. There seemed no sin, no shame, no wrath, no grief. I felt she too had spoken words that night, But softer certainly, and said to God, Who laughs in heaven perhaps that such as I Should make ado for such as she.—“Defiled” I wrote? “defiled” I thought her? Stoop, Stoop lower, Aurora! get the angel's leave To creep in somewhere, humbly, on your knees, Within this round of sequestration white In which they have wrapped earth's foundlings, heaven's elect. The next day we took train to Italy And fled on southward in the roar of steam. The marriage-bells of Romney must be loud, To sound so clear through all: I was not well, And truly, though the truth is like a jest, I could not choose but fancy, half the way, I stood alone i' the belfry, fifty bells Of naked iron, mad with merriment (As one who laughs and cannot stop himself), All clanking at me, in me, over me, Until I shrieked a shriek I could not hear, And swooned with noise,—but still, along my swoon, Was 'ware the baffled changes backward rang, Prepared, at each emerging sense, to beat And crash it out with clangour. I was weak; I struggled for the posture of my soul In upright consciousness of place and time, But evermore, 'twixt waking and asleep, Slipped somehow, staggered, caught at Marian's eyes A moment (it is very good for strength To know that some one needs you to be strong), And so recovered what I called myself, For that time. I just knew it when we swept Above the old roofs of Dijon: Lyons dropped A spark into the night, half trodden out Unseen. But presently the winding Rhone Washed out the moonlight large along his banks Which strained their yielding curves out clear and clean To hold it,—shadow of town and castle blurred Upon the hurrying river. Such an air Blew thence upon the forehead—half an air And half a water—that I leaned and looked, Then, turning back on Marian, smiled to mark That she looked only on her child, who slept, His face toward the moon too. So we passed The liberal open country and the close, And shot through tunnels, like a lightning-wedge By great Thor-hammers driven through the rock, Which, quivering through the intestine blackness, splits, And lets it in at once: the train swept in Athrob with effort, trembling with resolve, The fierce denouncing whistle wailing on And dying off smothered in the shuddering dark, While we, self-awed, drew troubled breath, oppressed As other Titans underneath the pile And nightmare of the mountains. Out, at last, To catch the dawn afloat upon the land! —Hills, slung forth broadly and gauntly everywhere, Not cramped in their foundations, pushing wide Rich outspreads of the vineyards and the corn (As if they entertained i' the name of France), While down their straining sides streamed manifest A soil as red as Charlemagne's knightly blood, To consecrate the verdure. Some one said “Marseilles!” And lo, the city of Marseilles, With all her ships behind her, and beyond, The scimitar of ever-shining sea For right-hand use, bared blue against the sky! That night we spent between the purple heaven And purple water: I think Marian slept; But I, as a dog a-watch for his master's foot, Who cannot sleep or eat before he hears, I sat upon the deck and watched the night And listened through the stars for Italy. Those marriage-bells I spoke of sounded far, As some child's go-cart in the street beneath To a dying man who will not pass the day, And knows it, holding by a hand he loves. I too sat quiet, satisfied with death, Sat silent: I could hear my own soul speak, And had my friend,—for Nature comes sometimes And says, “I am ambassador for God.” I felt the wind soft from the land of souls; The old miraculous mountains heaved in sight, One straining past another along the shore, The way of grand dull Odyssean ghosts, Athirst to drink the cool blue wine of seas And stare on voyagers. Peak pushing peak They stood: I watched, beyond that Tyrian belt Of intense sea betwixt them and the ship, Down all their sides the misty olive-woods Dissolving in the weak, congenial moon And still disclosing some brown convent tower That seems as if it grew from some brown rock, Or many a little lighted village, dropped Like a fallen star upon so high a point, You wonder what can keep it in its place From sliding headlong with the waterfalls Which powder all the myrtle and orange groves With spray of silver. Thus my Italy Was stealing on us. Genoa broke with day, The Doria's long pale palace striking out, From green hills in advance of the white town, A marble finger dominant to ships, Seen glimmering through the uncertain grey of dawn. And then I did not think, “My Italy,” I thought “My father!” O my father's house, Without his presence!—Places are too much, Or else too little, for immortal man— Too little, when love's May o'ergrows the ground; Too much, when that luxuriant robe of green Is rustling to our ankles in dead leaves. 'Tis only good to be or here or there, Because we had a dream on such a stone, Or this or that,—but, once being wholly waked And come back to the stone without the dream, We trip upon't,—alas, and hurt ourselves; Or else it falls on us and grinds us flat, The heaviest gravestone on this burying earth. —But while I stood and mused, a quiet touch Fell light upon my arm, and, turning round, A pair of moistened eyes convicted mine. “What, Marian! is the babe astir so soon?” “He sleeps,” she answered; “I have crept up thrice, And seen you sitting, standing, still at watch. I thought it did you good till now, but now” . . . “But now,” I said, “you leave the child alone.” “And you're alone,” she answered,—and she looked As if I too were something. Sweet the help Of one we have helped! Thanks, Marian, for such help. I found a house at Florence on the hill Of Bellosguardo. 'Tis a tower which keeps A post of double observation o'er That valley of Arno (holding as a hand The outspread city) straight toward Fiesole And Mount Morello and the setting sun, The Vallombrosan mountains opposite, Which sunrise fills as full as crystal cups Turned red to the brim because their wine is red. No sun could die nor yet be born unseen By dwellers at my villa: morn and eve Were magnified before us in the pure Illimitable space and pause of sky, Intense as angels' garments blanched with God, Less blue than radiant. From the outer wall Of the garden, drops the mystic floating grey Of olive-trees (with interruptions green From maize and vine), until 'tis caught and torn Upon the abrupt black line of cypresses Which signs the way to Florence. Beautiful The city lies along the ample vale, Cathedral, tower and palace, piazza and street, The river trailing like a silver cord Through all, and curling loosely, both before And after, over the whole stretch of land Sown whitely up and down its opposite slopes With farms and villas. Many weeks had passed, No word was granted.—Last, a letter came From Vincent Carrington:—“My dear Miss Leigh, You've been as silent as a poet should, When any other man is sure to speak. If sick, if vexed, if dumb, a silver piece Will split a man's tongue,—straight he speaks and says ‘Received that cheque.’ But you! . . . I send you funds To Paris, and you make no sign at all. Remember, I'm responsible and wait A sign of you, Miss Leigh. “Meantime your book Is eloquent as if you were not dumb; And common critics, ordinarily deaf To such fine meanings, and, like deaf men, loth To seem deaf, answering chance-wise, yes or no, ‘It must be’ or ‘it must not’ (most pronounced When least convinced), pronounce for once aright: You'd think they really heard,—and so they do . . . The burr of three or four who really hear And praise your book aright: Fame's smallest trump Is a great ear-trumpet for the deaf as posts, No other being effective. Fear not, friend; We think here you have written a good book, And you, a woman! It was in you—yes, I felt 'twas in you: yet I doubted half If that od-force of German Reichenbach, Which still from female finger-tips burns blue, Could strike out as our masculine white heats To quicken a man. Forgive me. All my heart Is quick with yours since, just a fortnight since, I read your book and loved it. “Will you love My wife, too? Here's my secret I might keep A month more from you! but I yield it up Because I know you'll write the sooner for't, Most women (of your height even) counting love Life's only serious business. Who's my wife That shall be in a month? you ask, nor guess? Remember what a pair of topaz eyes You once detected, turned against the wall, That morning in my London painting-room; The face half-sketched, and slurred; the eyes alone! But you . . . you caught them up with yours, and said ‘Kate Ward's eyes, surely.’—Now I own the truth: I had thrown them there to keep them safe from Jove, They would so naughtily find out their way To both the heads of both my Danaës Where just it made me mad to look at them. Such eyes! I could not paint or think of eyes But those,—and so I flung them into paint And turned them to the wall's care. Ay, but now I've let them out, my Kate's: I've painted her (I change my style and leave mythologies), The whole sweet face; it looks upon my soul Like a face on water, to beget itself. A half-length portrait, in a hanging cloak Like one you wore once; 'tis a little frayed,— I pressed too for the nude harmonious arm; But she, she'd have her way, and have her cloak— She said she could be like you only so, And would not miss the fortune. Ah, my friend, You'll write and say she shall not miss your love Through meeting mine? in faith, she would not change. She has your books by heart more than my words, And quotes you up against me till I'm pushed Where, three months since, her eyes were: nay, in fact, Nought satisfied her but to make me paint Your last book folded in her dimpled hands Instead of my brown palette as I wished, And, grant me, the presentment had been newer; She'd grant me nothing: I compounded for The naming of the wedding-day next month, And gladly too. 'Tis pretty to remark How women can love women of your sort, And tie their hearts with love-knots to your feet, Grow insolent about you against men, And put us down by putting up the lip, As if a man—there are such, let us own, Who write not ill—remains a man, poor wretch, While you—! Write weaker than Aurora Leigh, And there'll be women who believe of you (Besides my Kate) that if you walked on sand You would not leave a foot-print. “Are you put To wonder by my marriage, like poor Leigh? ‘Kate Ward!’ he said. ‘Kate Ward!’ he said anew. ‘I thought . . .’ he said, and stopped—‘I did not think . . .’ And then he dropped to silence. “Ah, he's changed. I had not seen him, you're aware, for long, But went of course. I have not touched on this Through all this letter—conscious of your heart, And writing lightlier for the heavy fact, As clocks are voluble with lead. “How poor, To say I'm sorry! dear Leigh, dearest Leigh. In those old days of Shropshire—pardon me— When he and you fought many a field of gold On what you should do, or you should not do, Make bread or verses (it just came to that), I thought you'd one day draw a silken peace Through a golden ring. I thought so: foolishly, The event proved; for you went more opposite To each other, month by month, and year by year, Until this happened. God knows best, we say, But hoarsely. When the fever took him first, Just after I had writ to you in France, They tell me, Lady Waldemar mixed drinks And counted grains, like any salaried nurse, Excepting that she wept too. Then Lord Howe, You're right about Lord Howe, Lord Howe's a trump, And yet, with such in his hand, a man like Leigh May lose as he does. There's an end to all, Yes, even this letter, though this second sheet May find you doubtful. Write a word for Kate: She reads my letters always, like a wife, And if she sees her name I'll see her smile And share the luck. So, bless you, friend of two! I will not ask you what your feeling is At Florence with my pictures; I can hear Your heart a-flutter over the snow-hills: And, just to pace the Pitti with you once, I'd give a half-hour of to-morrow's walk With Kate . . . I think so. Vincent Carrington.” The noon was hot; the air scorched like the sun, And was shut out. The closed persiani threw Their long-scored shadows on my villa-floor, And interlined the golden atmosphere Straight, still,—across the pictures on the wall, The statuette on the console (of young Love And Psyche made one marble by a kiss), The low couch where I leaned, the table near, The vase of lilies Marian pulled last night (Each green leaf and each white leaf ruled in black As if for writing some new text of fate), And the open letter, rested on my knee, But there the lines swerved, trembled, though I sat Untroubled, plainly, reading it again, And three times. Well, he's married; that is clear. No wonder that he's married, nor much more That Vincent's therefore “sorry.” Why, of course The lady nursed him when he was not well, Mixed drinks,—unless nepenthe was the drink 'Twas scarce worth telling. But a man in love Will see the whole sex in his mistress' hood, The prettier for its lining of fair rose, Although he catches back and says at last, “I'm sorry.” Sorry. Lady Waldemar At prettiest, under the said hood, preserved From such a light as I could hold to her face To flare its ugly wrinkles out to shame, Is scarce a wife for Romney, as friends judge, Aurora Leigh or Vincent Carrington, That's plain. And if he's “conscious of my heart” . . . It may be natural, though the phrase is strong (One's apt to use strong phrases, being in love); And even that stuff of “fields of gold,” “gold rings,” And what he “thought,” poor Vincent, what he “thought,” May never mean enough to ruffle me. —Why, this room stifles. Better burn than choke; Best have air, air, although it comes with fire, Throw open blinds and windows to the noon, And take a blister on my brow instead Of this dead weight! best, perfectly be stunned By those insufferable cicale, sick And hoarse with rapture of the summer-heat, That sing, like poets, till their hearts break,—sing Till men say “It's too tedious.” Books succeed, And lives fail. Do I feel it so, at last? Kate loves a worn-out cloak for being like mine, While I live self-despised for being myself, And yearn toward some one else, who yearns away From what he is, in his turn. Strain a step For ever, yet gain no step? Are we such, We cannot, with our admirations even, Our tip-toe aspirations, touch a thing That's higher than we? is all a dismal flat, And God alone above each, as the sun O'er level lagunes, to make them shine and stink— Laying stress upon us with immediate flame, While we respond with our miasmal fog, And call it mounting higher because we grow More highly fatal? Tush, Aurora Leigh! You wear your sackcloth looped in Cæsar's way, And brag your failings as mankind's. Be still. There is what's higher, in this very world, Than you can live, or catch at. Stand aside And look at others—instance little Kate! She'll make a perfect wife for Carrington. She always has been looking round the earth For something good and green to alight upon And nestle into, with those soft-winged eyes, Subsiding now beneath his manly hand 'Twixt trembling lids of inexpressive joy. I will not scorn her, after all, too much, That so much she should love me: a wise man Can pluck a leaf, and find a lecture in't; And I, too, . . . God has made me,—I've a heart That's capable of worship, love, and loss; We say the same of Shakespeare's. I'll be meek And learn to reverence, even this poor myself. The book, too—pass it. “A good book,” says he, “And you a woman.” I had laughed at that, But long since. I'm a woman, it is true; Alas, and woe to us, when we feel it most! Then, least care have we for the crowns and goals And compliments on writing our good books. The book has some truth in it, I believe, And truth outlives pain, as the soul does life. I know we talk our Phædons to the end, Through all the dismal faces that we make, O'erwrinkled with dishonouring agony From decomposing drugs. I have written truth, And I a woman,—feebly, partially, Inaptly in presentation, Romney'll add, Because a woman. For the truth itself, That's neither man's nor woman's, but just God's, None else has reason to be proud of truth: Himself will see it sifted, disenthralled, And kept upon the height and in the light, As far as and no farther than 'tis truth; For, now He has left off calling firmaments And strata, flowers and creatures, very good, He says it still of truth, which is His own. Truth, so far, in my book; the truth which draws Through all things upwards—that a twofold world Must go to a perfect cosmos. Natural things And spiritual,—who separates those two In art, in morals, or the social drift, Tears up the bond of nature and brings death, Paints futile pictures, writes unreal verse, Leads vulgar days, deals ignorantly with men, Is wrong, in short, at all points. We divide This apple of life, and cut it through the pips: The perfect round which fitted Venus' hand Has perished as utterly as if we ate Both halves. Without the spiritual, observe, The natural's impossible—no form, No motion: without sensuous, spiritual Is inappreciable,—no beauty or power: And in this twofold sphere the twofold man (For still the artist is intensely a man) Holds firmly by the natural, to reach The spiritual beyond it,—fixes still The type with mortal vision, to pierce through, With eyes immortal, to the antitype Some call the ideal,—better called the real, And certain to be called so presently When things shall have their names. Look long enough On any peasant's face here, coarse and lined, You'll catch Antinous somewhere in that clay, As perfect featured as he yearns at Rome From marble pale with beauty; then persist, And, if your apprehension's competent, You'll find some fairer angel at his back, As much exceeding him as he the boor, And pushing him with empyreal disdain For ever out of sight. Ay, Carrington Is glad of such a creed: an artist must, Who paints a tree, a leaf, a common stone, With just his hand, and finds it suddenly A-piece with and conterminous to his soul. Why else do these things move him, leaf or stone? The bird's not moved that pecks at a springshoot; Nor yet the horse, before a quarry a-graze: But man, the twofold creature, apprehends The twofold manner, in and outwardly, And nothing in the world comes single to him, A mere itself,—cup, column, or candlestick, All patterns of what shall be in the Mount; The whole temporal show related royally, And built up to eterne significance Through the open arms of God. “There's nothing great Nor small,” has said a poet of our day, Whose voice will ring beyond the curfew of eve And not be thrown out by the matin's bell: And truly, I reiterate, nothing's small! No lily-muffled hum of a summer-bee, But finds some coupling with the spinning stars; No pebble at your foot, but proves a sphere; No chaffinch, but implies the cherubim; And (glancing on my own thin, veinèd wrist) In such a little tremor of the blood The whole strong clamour of a vehement soul Doth utter itself distinct. Earth's crammed with heaven, And every common bush afire with God; But only he who sees, takes off his shoes— The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries, And daub their natural faces unaware More and more from the first similitude. Truth, so far, in my book! a truth which draws From all things upward. I, Aurora, still Have felt it hound me through the wastes of life As Jove did Io; and, until that Hand Shall overtake me wholly and on my head Lay down its large unfluctuating peace, The feverish gad-fly pricks me up and down. It must be. Art's the witness of what Is Behind this show. If this world's show were all, Then imitation would be all in Art; There, Jove's hand gripes us!—For we stand here, we, If genuine artists, witnessing for God's Complete, consummate, undivided work; That every natural flower which grows on earth Implies a flower upon the spiritual side, Substantial, archetypal, all aglow With blossoming causes,—not so far away, But we, whose spirit-sense is somewhat cleared, May catch at something of the bloom and breath,— Too vaguely apprehended, though indeed Still apprehended, consciously or not, And still transferred to picture, music, verse, For thrilling audient and beholding souls By signs and touches which are known to souls. How known, they know not,—why, they cannot find, So straight call out on genius, say “A man Produced this,” when much rather they should say “'Tis insight and he saw this.” Thus is Art Self-magnified in magnifying a truth Which, fully recognised, would change the world And shift its morals. If a man could feel, Not one day, in the artist's ecstasy, But every day, feast, fast, or working-day, The spiritual significance burn through The hieroglyphic of material shows, Henceforward he would paint the globe with wings, And reverence fish and fowl, the bull, the tree, And even his very body as a man— Which now he counts so vile, that all the towns Make offal of their daughters for its use, On summer-nights, when God is sad in heaven To think what goes on in His recreant world He made quite other; while that moon He made To shine there, at the first love's covenant, Shines still, convictive as a marriage-ring Before adulterous eyes. How sure it is, That, if we say a true word, instantly We feel 'tis God's, not ours, and pass it on Like bread at sacrament we taste and pass Nor handle for a moment, as indeed We dared to set up any claim to such! And I—my poem,—let my readers talk. I'm closer to it—I can speak as well: I'll say with Romney, that the book is weak, The range uneven, the points of sight obscure, The music interrupted. Let us go. The end of woman (or of man, I think) Is not a book. Alas, the best of books Is but a word in Art, which soon grows cramped, Stiff, dubious-statured with the weight of years, And drops an accent or digamma down Some cranny of unfathomable time, Beyond the critic's reaching. Art itself, We've called the larger life, must feel the soul Live past it. For more's felt than is perceived, And more's perceived than can be interpreted, And Love strikes higher with his lambent flame Than Art can pile the faggots. Is it so? When Jove's hand meets us with composing touch, And when at last we are hushed and satisfied, Then Io does not call it truth, but love? Well, well! my father was an Englishman: My mother's blood in me is not so strong That I should bear this stress of Tuscan noon And keep my wits. The town, there, seems to seethe In this Medæan boil-pot of the sun, And all the patient hills are bubbling round As if a prick would leave them flat. Does heaven Keep far off, not to set us in a blaze? Not so,—let drag your fiery fringes, heaven, And burn us up to quiet. Ah, we know Too much here, not to know what's best for peace; We have too much light here, not to want more fire To purify and end us. We talk, talk, Conclude upon divine philosophies, And get the thanks of men for hopeful books, Whereat we take our own life up, and . . . pshaw! Unless we piece it with another's life (A yard of silk to carry out our lawn) As well suppose my little handkerchief Would cover Samminiato, church and all, If out I threw it past the cypresses, As, in this ragged, narrow life of mine, Contain my own conclusions. But at least We'll shut up the persiani and sit down, And when my head's done aching, in the cool, Write just a word to Kate and Carrington. May joy be with them! she has chosen well, And he not ill. I should be glad, I think, Except for Romney. Had he married Kate, I surely, surely, should be very glad. This Florence sits upon me easily, With native air and tongue. My graves are calm, And do not too much hurt me. Marian's good, Gentle and loving,—lets me hold the child, Or drags him up the hills to find me flowers And fill these vases ere I'm quite awake,— My grandiose red tulips, which grow wild, Or Dante's purple lilies, which he blew To a larger bubble with his prophet breath, Or one of those tall flowering reeds that stand In Arno, like a sheaf of sceptres left By some remote dynasty of dead gods To suck the stream for ages and get green, And blossom wheresoe'er a hand divine Had warmed the place with ichor. Such I find At early morning laid across my bed, And wake up pelted with a childish laugh Which even Marian's low precipitous “hush” Has vainly interposed to put away,— While I, with shut eyes, smile and motion for The dewy kiss that's very sure to come From mouth and cheeks, the whole child's face at once Dissolved on mine,—as if a nosegay burst Its string with the weight of roses overblown, And dropped upon me. Surely I should be glad. The little creature almost loves me now, And calls my name, “Alola,” stripping off The r's like thorns, to make it smooth enough To take between his dainty, milk-fed lips, God love him! I should certainly be glad, Except, God help me, that I'm sorrowful Because of Romney. Romney, Romney! Well, This grows absurd!—too like a tune that runs I' the head, and forces all things in the world, Wind, rain, the creaking gnat, or stuttering fly, To sing itself and vex you,—yet perhaps A paltry tune you never fairly liked, Some “I'd be a butterfly,” or “C'est l'amour:” We're made so,—not such tyrants to ourselves But still we are slaves to nature. Some of us Are turned, too, overmuch like some poor verse With a trick of ritournelle: the same thing goes And comes back ever. Vincent Carrington Is “sorry,” and I'm sorry; but he's strong To mount from sorrow to his heaven of love, And when he says at moments, “Poor, poor Leigh, Who'll never call his own so true a heart, So fair a face even,”—he must quickly lose The pain of pity, in the blush he makes By his very pitying eyes. The snow, for him, Has fallen in May and finds the whole earth warm, And melts at the first touch of the green grass. But Romney,—he has chosen, after all. I think he had as excellent a sun To see by, as most others, and perhaps Has scarce seen really worse than some of us When all's said. Let him pass. I'm not too much A woman, not to be a man for once And bury all my Dead like Alaric, Depositing the treasures of my soul In this drained watercourse, then letting flow The river of life again with commerce-ships And pleasure-barges full of silks and songs. Blow, winds, and help us. Ah, we mock ourselves With talking of the winds; perhaps as much With other resolutions. How it weighs, This hot, sick air! and how I covet here The Dead's provision on the river-couch, With silver curtains drawn on tinkling rings! Or else their rest in quiet crypts,—laid by From heat and noise;—from those cicale, say, And this more vexing heart-beat. So it is: We covet for the soul, the body's part, To die and rot. Even so, Aurora, ends Our aspiration who bespoke our place So far in the east. The occidental flats Had fed us fatter, therefore? we have climbed Where herbage ends? we want the beast's part now And tire of the angel's?—Men define a man, The creature who stands frontward to the stars, The creature who looks inward to himself, The tool-wright, laughing creature. 'Tis enough: We'll say instead, the inconsequent creature, man, For that's his specialty. What creature else Conceives the circle, and then walks the square? Loves things proved bad, and leaves a thing proved good? You think the bee makes honey half a year, To loathe the comb in winter and desire The little ant's food rather? But a man— Note men!—they are but women after all, As women are but Auroras!—there are men Born tender, apt to pale at a trodden worm, Who paint for pastime, in their favourite dream, Spruce auto-vestments flowered with crocus-flames. There are, too, who believe in hell, and lie; There are, too, who believe in heaven, and fear: There are, who waste their souls in working out Life's problem on these sands betwixt two tides, Concluding,—“Give us the oyster's part, in death.” Alas, long-suffering and most patient God, Thou needst be surelier God to bear with us Than even to have made us! thou aspire, aspire From henceforth for me! thou who hast thyself Endured this fleshhood, knowing how as a soaked And sucking vesture it can drag us down And choke us in the melancholy Deep, Sustain me, that with thee I walk these waves, Resisting!—breathe me upward, thou in me Aspiring who art the way, the truth, the life,— That no truth henceforth seem indifferent, No way to truth laborious, and no life, Not even this life I live, intolerable! The days went by. I took up the old days, With all their Tuscan pleasures worn and spoiled, Like some lost book we dropped in the long grass On such a happy summer-afternoon When last we read it with a loving friend, And find in autumn when the friend is gone, The grass cut short, the weather changed, too late, And stare at, as at something wonderful For sorrow,—thinking how two hands before Had held up what is left to only one, And how we smiled when such a vehement nail Impressed the tiny dint here which presents This verse in fire for ever. Tenderly And mournfully I lived. I knew the birds And insects,—which looked fathered by the flowers And emulous of their hues: I recognised The moths, with that great overpoise of wings Which make a mystery of them how at all They can stop flying: butterflies, that bear Upon their blue wings such red embers round, They seem to scorch the blue air into holes Each flight they take: and fire-flies, that suspire In short soft lapses of transported flame Across the tingling Dark, while overhead The constant and inviolable stars Outburn those light-of-love: melodious owls (If music had but one note and was sad, 'Twould sound just so), and all the silent swirl Of bats that seem to follow in the air Some grand circumference of a shadowy dome To which we are blind: and then the nightingales, Which pluck our heart across a garden-wall (When walking in the town) and carry it So high into the bowery almond trees We tremble and are afraid, and feel as if The golden flood of moonlight unaware Dissolved the pillars of the steady earth And made it less substantial. And I knew The harmless opal snakes, the large-mouthed frogs (Those noisy vaunters of their shallow streams); And lizards, the green lightnings of the wall, Which, if you sit down quiet, nor sigh loud, Will flatter you and take you for a stone, And flash familiarly about your feet With such prodigious eyes in such small heads!— I knew them (though they had somewhat dwindled from My childish imagery), and kept in mind How last I sat among them equally, In fellowship and mateship, as a child Feels equall still toward insect, beast, and bird, Before the Adam in him has forgone All privilege of Eden,—making friends And talk with such a bird or such a goat, And buying many a two-inch-wide rush-cage To let out the caged cricket on a tree, Saying “Oh, my dear grillino, were you cramped? And are you happy with the ilex-leaves? And do you love me who have let you go? Say yes in singing, and I'll understand.” But now the creatures all seemed farther off, No longer mine, nor like me, only there, A gulf between us. I could yearn indeed, Like other rich men, for a drop of dew To cool this heat,—a drop of the early dew, The irrecoverable child-innocence (Before the heart took fire and withered life) When childhood might pair equally with birds; But now . . . the birds were grown too proud for us, Alas, the very sun forbids the dew. And I, I had come back to an empty nest, Which every bird's too wise for. How I heard My father's step on that deserted ground, His voice along that silence, as he told The names of bird and insect, tree and flower, And all the presentations of the stars Across Valdarno, interposing still “My child,” “my child.” When fathers say “my child,” 'Tis easier to conceive the universe, And life's transitions down the steps of law. I rode once to the little mountain-house As fast as if to find my father there, But, when in sight of't, within fifty yards, I dropped my horse's bridle on his neck And paused upon his flank. The house's front Was cased with lingots of ripe Indian corn In tessellated order and device Of golden patterns, not a stone of wall Uncovered,—not an inch of room to grow A vine-leaf. The old porch had disappeared; And right in the open doorway sat a girl At plaiting straws, her black hair strained away To a scarlet kerchief caught beneath her chin In Tuscan fashion,—her full ebon eyes, Which looked too heavy to be lifted so, Still dropped and lifted toward the mulberry-tree On which the lads were busy with their staves In shout and laughter, stripping every bough As bare as winter, of those summer leaves My father had not changed for all the silk In which the ugly silkworms hide themselves. Enough. My horse recoiled before my heart; I turned the rein abruptly. Back we went As fast, to Florence. That was trial enough Of graves. I would not visit, if I could, My father's, or my mother's any more, To see if stone cutter or lichen beat So early in the race, or throw my flowers, Which could not out-smell heaven or sweeten earth. They live too far above, that I should look So far below to find them: let me think That rather they are visiting my grave, Called life here (undeveloped yet to life), And that they drop upon me, now and then, For token or for solace, some small weed Least odorous of the growths of paradise, To spare such pungent scents as kill with joy. My old Assunta, too, was dead, was dead— O land of all men's past! for me alone, It would not mix its tenses. I was past, It seemed, like others,—only not in heaven. And many a Tuscan eve I wandered down The cypress alley like a restless ghost That tries its feeble ineffectual breath Upon its own charred funeral-brands put out Too soon, where black and stiff stood up the trees Against the broad vermilion of the skies. Such skies!—all clouds abolished in a sweep Of God's skirt, with a dazzle to ghosts and men, As down I went, saluting on the bridge The hem of such before't was caught away Beyond the peaks of Lucca. Underneath, The river, just escaping from the weight Of that intolerable glory, ran In acquiescent shadow murmurously; While, up beside it, streamed the festa-folk With fellow-murmurs from their feet and fans, And issimo and ino and sweet poise Of vowels in their pleasant scandalous talk; Returning from the grand-duke's dairy-farm Before the trees grew dangerous at eight (For “trust no tree by moonlight,” Tuscans say), To eat their ice at Donay's tenderly,— Each lovely lady close to a cavalier Who holds her dear fan while she feeds her smile On meditative spoonfuls of vanille And listens to his hot-breathed vows of love Enough to thaw her cream and scorch his beard. 'Twas little matter. I could pass them by Indifferently, not fearing to be known. No danger of being wrecked upon a friend, And forced to take an iceberg for an isle! The very English, here, must wait and learn To hang the cobweb of their gossip out To catch a fly. I'm happy. It's sublime, This perfect solitude of foreign lands! To be, as if you had not been till then, And were then, simply that you chose to be: To spring up, not be brought forth from the ground, Like grasshoppers at Athens, and skip thrice Before a woman makes a pounce on you And plants you in her hair!—possess, yourself, A new world all alive with creatures new, New sun, new moon, new flowers, new people—ah, And be possessed by none of them! no right In one, to call your name, inquire your where, Or what you think of Mister Someone's book, Or Mister Other's marriage or decease, Or how's the headache which you had last week, Or why you look so pale still, since it's gone? —Such most surprising riddance of one's life Comes next one's death; 'tis disembodiment Without the pang. I marvel, people choose To stand stock-still like fakirs, till the moss Grows on them and they cry out, self-admired, “How verdant and how virtuous!” Well, I'm glad; Or should be, if grown foreign to myself As surely as to others. Musing so, I walked the narrow unrecognising streets, Where many a palace-front peers gloomily Through stony vizors iron-barred (prepared Alike, should foe or lover pass that way, For guest or victim), and came wandering out Upon the churches with mild open doors And plaintive wail of vespers, where a few, Those chiefly women, sprinkled round in blots Upon the dusky pavement, knelt and prayed Toward the altar's silver glory. Oft a ray (I liked to sit and watch) would tremble out, Just touch some face more lifted, more in need (Of course a woman's),—while I dreamed a tale To fit its fortunes. There was one who looked As if the earth had suddenly grown too large For such a little humpbacked thing as she; The pitiful black kerchief round her neck Sole proof she had had a mother. One, again, Looked sick for love,—seemed praying some soft saint To put more virtue in the new fine scarf She spent a fortnight's meals on, yesterday, That cruel Gigi might return his eyes From Giuliana. There was one, so old, So old, to kneel grew easier than to stand,— So solitary, she accepts at last Our Lady for her gossip, and frets on Against the sinful world which goes its rounds In marrying and being married, just the same As when 'twas almost good and had the right (Her Gian alive, and she herself eighteen). “And yet, now even, if Madonna willed, She'd win a tern in Thursday's lottery And better all things. Did she dream for nought, That, boiling cabbage for the fast-day's soup, It smelt like blessèd entrails? such a dream For nought? would sweetest Mary cheat her so, And lose that certain candle, straight and white As any fair grand-duchess in her teens, Which otherwise should flare here in a week? Benigna sis, thou beauteous Queen of Heaven!” I sat there musing, and imagining Such utterance from such faces: poor blind souls That writhe toward heaven along the devil's trail,— Who knows, I thought, but He may stretch His hand And pick them up? 'tis written in the Book He heareth the young ravens when they cry, And yet they cry for carrion.—O my God, And we, who make excuses for the rest, We do it in our measure. Then I knelt, And dropped my head upon the pavement too, And prayed, since I was foolish in desire Like other creatures, craving offal-food, That He would stop His ears to what I said, And only listen to the run and beat Of this poor, passionate, helpless blood— And then I lay, and spoke not: but He heard in heaven. So many Tuscan evenings passed the same. I could not lose a sunset on the bridge, And would not miss a vigil in the church, And liked to mingle with the outdoor crowd So strange and gay and ignorant of my face, For men you know not are as good as trees. And only once, at the Santissima, I almost chanced upon a man I knew, Sir Blaise Delorme. He saw me certainly, And somewhat hurried, as he crossed himself, The smoothness of the action,—then half bowed, But only half, and merely to my shade, I slipped so quick behind the porphyry plinth And left him dubious if 'twas really I Or peradventure Satan's usual trick To keep a mounting saint uncanonised. But he was safe for that time, and I too; The argent angels in the altar-flare Absorbed his soul next moment. The good man! In England we were scarce acquaintances, That here in Florence he should keep my thought Beyond the image on his eye, which came And went: and yet his thought disturbed my life: For, after that, I oftener sat at home On evenings, watching how they fined themselves With gradual conscience to a perfect night, Until the moon, diminished to a curve, Lay out there like a sickle for His hand Who cometh down at last to reap the earth. At such times, ended seemed my trade of verse; I feared to jingle bells upon my robe Before the four-faced silent cherubim With God so near me, could I sing of God? I did not write, nor read, nor even think, But sat absorbed amid the quickening glooms, Most like some passive broken lump of salt Dropped in by chance to a bowl of œnomel, To spoil the drink a little and lose itself, Dissolving slowly, slowly, until lost. EIGHTH BOOK. One eve it happened, when I sat alone, Alone, upon the terrace of my tower, A book upon my knees to counterfeit The reading that I never read at all, While Marian, in the garden down below, Knelt by the fountain I could just hear thrill The drowsy silence of the exhausted day, And peeled a new fig from that purple heap In the grass beside her, turning out the red To feed her eager child (who sucked at it With vehement lips across a gap of air As he stood opposite, face and curls a-flame With that last sun-ray, crying “Give me, give,” And stamping with imperious baby-feet, We're all born princes)—something startled me, The laugh of sad and innocent souls, that breaks Abruptly, as if frightened at itself. 'Twas Marian laughed. I saw her glance above In sudden shame that I should hear her laugh, And straightway dropped my eyes upon my book, And knew, the first time, 'twas Boccaccio's tale, The Falcon's, of the lover who for love Destroyed the best that loved him. Some of us Do it still, and then we sit and laugh no more. Laugh you, sweet Marian,—you've the right to laugh, Since God Himself is for you, and a child! For me there's somewhat less,—and so I sigh. The heavens were making room to hold the night, The sevenfold heavens unfolding all their gates To let the stars out slowly (prophesied In close-approaching advent, not discerned), While still the cue-owls from the cypresses Of the Poggio called and counted every pulse Of the skyey palpitation. Gradually The purple and transparent shadows slow Had filled up the whole valley to the brim, And flooded all the city, which you saw As some drowned city in some enchanted sea, Cut off from nature,—drawing you who gaze, With passionate desire, to leap and plunge And find a sea-king with a voice of waves, And treacherous soft eyes, and slippery locks You cannot kiss but you shall bring away Their salt upon your lips. The duomo-bell Strikes ten, as if it struck ten fathoms down, So deep; and twenty churches answer it The same, with twenty various instances. Some gaslights tremble along squares and streets; The Pitti's palace-front is drawn in fire; And, past the quays, Maria Novella Place, In which the mystic obelisks stand up Triangular, pyramidal, each based Upon its four-square brazen tortoises, To guard that fair church, Buonarroti's Bride, That stares out from her large blind dial-eyes, (Her quadrant and armillary dials, black With rhythms of many suns and moons) in vain Inquiry for so rich a soul as his. Methinks I have plunged, I see it all so clear . . . And, O my heart, . . . the sea-king! In my ears The sound of waters. There he stood, my king! I felt him, rather than beheld him. Up I rose, as if he were my king indeed, And then sat down, in trouble at myself, And struggling for my woman's empery. 'Tis pitiful; but women are so made: We'll die for you perhaps,—'tis probable; But we'll not spare you an inch of our full height: We'll have our whole just stature,—five feet four, Though laid out in our coffins: pitiful. —“You, Romney!—Lady Waldemar is here?” He answered in a voice which was not his. “I have her letter; you shall read it soon. But first, I must be heard a little, I, Who have waited long and travelled far for that, Although you thought to have shut a tedious book And farewell. Ah, you dog-eared such a page, And here you find me.” Did he touch my hand, Or but my sleeve? I trembled, hand and foot,— He must have touched me.—“Will you sit?” I asked, And motioned to a chair; but down he sat, A little slowly, as a man in doubt, Upon the couch beside me,—couch and chair Being wheeled upon the terrace. “You are come, My cousin Romney?—this is wonderful. But all is wonder on such summer-nights; And nothing should surprise us any more, Who see that miracle of stars. Behold.” I signed above, where all the stars were out, As if an urgent heat had started there A secret writing from a sombre page, A blank, last moment, crowded suddenly With hurrying splendours. “Then you do not know”— He murmured. “Yes, I know,” I said, “I know. I had the news from Vincent Carrington. And yet I did not think you'd leave the work In England, for so much even,—though of course You'll make a work-day of your holiday, And turn it to our Tuscan people's use,— Who much need helping since the Austrian boar (So bold to cross the Alp to Lombardy And dash his brute front unabashed against The steep snow-bosses of that shield of God Who soon shall rise in wrath and shake it clear) Came hither also, raking up our grape And olive gardens with his tyrannous tusk, And rolling on our maize with all his swine.” “You had the news from Vincent Carrington,” He echoed,—picking up the phrase beyond, As if he knew the rest was merely talk To fill a gap and keep out a strong wind; “You had, then, Vincent's personal news?” “His own,” I answered. “All that ruined world of yours Seems crumbling into marriage. Carrington Has chosen wisely.” “Do you take it so?” He cried, “and is it possible at last” . . . He paused there,—and then, inward to himself, “Too much at last, too late!—yet certainly” . . . (And there his voice swayed as an Alpine plank That feels a passionate torrent underneath) “The knowledge, had I known it first or last, Could scarce have changed the actual case for me. And best for her at this time.” Nay, I thought, He loves Kate Ward, it seems, now, like a man, Because he has married Lady Waldemar! Ah, Vincent's letter said how Leigh was moved To hear that Vincent was betrothed to Kate. With what cracked pitchers go we to deep wells In this world! Then I spoke,—“I did not think, My cousin, you had ever known Kate Ward.” “In fact, I never knew her. 'Tis enough That Vincent did, and therefore chose his wife For other reasons than those topaz eyes We've heard of. Not to undervalue them, For all that. One takes up the world with eyes.” —Including Romney Leigh, I thought again, Albeit he knows them only by repute. How vile must all men be, since he's a man. His deep pathetic voice, as if he guessed I did not surely love him, took the word; “You never got a letter from Lord Howe A month back, dear Aurora?” “None,” I said. “I felt it was so,” he replied: “yet, strange! Sir Blaise Delorme has passed through Florence?” “Ay, By chance I saw him in Our Lady's church (I saw him, mark you, but he saw not me), Clean-washed in holy water from the count Of things terrestrial,—letters, and the rest; He had crossed us out together with his sins. Ay, strange; but only strange that good Lord Howe Preferred him to the post because of pauls. For me I'm sworn to never trust a man— At least with letters.” “There were facts to tell, To smooth with eye and accent. Howe supposed . . . Well, well, no matter! there was dubious need; You heard the news from Vincent Carrington. And yet perhaps you had been startled less To see me, dear Aurora, if you had read That letter.” —Now he sets me down as vexed. I think I've draped myself in woman's pride To a perfect purpose. Oh, I'm vexed, it seems! My friend Lord Howe deputes his friend Sir Blaise To break as softly as a sparrow's egg That lets a bird out tenderly, the news Of Romney's marriage to a certain saint; To smooth with eye and accent,—indicate His possible presence. Excellently well You've played your part, my Lady Waldemar,— As I've played mine. “Dear Romney,” I began, “You did not use, of old, to be so like A Greek king coming from a taken Troy, 'Twas needful that precursors spread your path With three-piled carpets, to receive your foot And dull the sound of't. For myself, be sure, Although it frankly grinds the gravel here, I still can bear it. Yet I'm sorry too To lose this famous letter, which Sir Blaise Has twisted to a lighter absently To fire some holy taper: dear Lord Howe Writes letters good for all things but to lose; And many a flower of London gossipry Has dropped wherever such a stem broke off. Of course I feel that, lonely among my vines, Where nothing's talked of, save the blight again, And no more Chianti! Still the letter's use As preparation . . . . . Did I start indeed? Last night I started at a cockchafer, And shook a half-hour after. Have you learnt No more of women, 'spite of privilege, Than still to take account too seriously Of such weak flutterings? Why, we like it, sir, We get our powers and our effects that way: The trees stand stiff and still at time of frost, If no wind tears them; but, let summer come, When trees are happy,—and a breath avails To set them trembling through a million leaves In luxury of emotion. Something less It takes to move a woman: let her start And shake at pleasure,—nor conclude at yours, The winter's bitter,—but the summer's green.” He answered: “Be the summer ever green With you, Aurora!—though you sweep your sex With somewhat bitter gusts from where you live Above them,—whirling downward from your heights Your very own pine-cones, in a grand disdain Of the lowland burrs with which you scatter them. So high and cold to others and yourself, A little less to Romney were unjust, And thus, I would not have you. Let it pass: I feel content so. You can bear indeed My sudden step beside you: but for me, 'Twould move me sore to hear your softened voice,— Aurora's voice,—if softened unaware In pity of what I am.” Ah friend, I thought, As husband of the Lady Waldemar You're granted very sorely pitiable! And yet Aurora Leigh must guard her voice From softening in the pity of your case, As if from lie or license. Certainly We'll soak up all the slush and soil of life With softened voices, ere we come to you. At which I interrupted my own thought And spoke out calmly. “Let us ponder, friend, Whate'er our state we must have made it first; And though the thing displease us, ay, perhaps Displease us warrantably, never doubt That other states, thought possible once, and then Rejected by the instinct of our lives, If then adopted had displeased us more Than this in which the choice, the will, the love, Has stamped the honour of a patent act From henceforth. What we choose may not be good, But, that we choose it, proves it good for us Potentially, fantastically, now Or last year, rather than a thing we saw, And saw no need for choosing. Moths will burn Their wings,—which proves that light is good for moths, Who else had flown not where they agonise.” “Ay, light is good,” he echoed, and there paused; And then abruptly, . . . “Marian. Marian's well?” I bowed my head but found no word. 'Twas hard To speak of her to Lady Waldemar's New husband. How much did he know, at last? How much? how little?—He would take no sign, But straight repeated,—“Marian. Is she well?” “She's well,” I answered. She was there in sight An hour back, but the night had drawn her home, Where still I heard her in an upper room, Her low voice singing to the child in bed, Who, restless with the summer-heat and play And slumber snatched at noon, was long sometimes In falling off, and took a score of songs And mother-hushes ere she saw him sound. “She's well,” I answered. “Here?” he asked. “Yes, here.” He stopped and sighed. “That shall be presently, But now this must be. I have words to say, And would be alone to say them, I with you, And no third troubling.” “Speak then,” I returned, “She will not vex you.” At which, suddenly He turned his face upon me with its smile As if to crush me. “I have read your book, Aurora.” “You have read it,” I replied, “And I have writ it,—we have done with it. And now the rest?” “The rest is like the first,” He answered,—“for the book is in my heart, Lives in me, wakes in me, and dreams in me: My daily bread tastes of it,—and my wine Which has no smack of it, I pour it out, It seems unnatural drinking.” Bitterly I took the word up; “Never waste your wine. The book lived in me ere it lived in you; I know it closer than another does, And how it's foolish, feeble, and afraid, And all unworthy so much compliment. Beseech you, keep your wine,—and, when you drink, Still wish some happier fortune to a friend, Than even to have written a far better book.” He answered gently, “That is consequent: The poet looks beyond the book he has made, Or else he had not made it. If a man Could make a man, he'd henceforth be a god In feeling what a little thing is man: It is not my case. And this special book, I did not make it, to make light of it: It stands above my knowledge, draws me up; 'Tis high to me. It may be that the book Is not so high, but I so low, instead; Still high to me. I mean no compliment: I will not say there are not, young or old, Male writers, ay, or female, let it pass, Who'll write us richer and completer books. A man may love a woman perfectly, And yet by no means ignorantly maintain A thousand women have not larger eyes: Enough that she alone has looked at him With eyes that, large or small, have won his soul. And so, this book, Aurora,—so, your book.” “Alas,” I answered, “is it so, indeed?” And then was silent. “Is it so, indeed,” He echoed, “that alas is all your word?” I said, “I'm thinking of a far-off June, When you and I, upon my birthday once, Discoursed of life and art, with both untried. I'm thinking, Romney, how 'twas morning then, And now 'tis night.” “And now,” he said, “'tis night.” “I'm thinking,” I resumed, “'tis somewhat sad, That if I had known, that morning in the dew, My cousin Romney would have said such words On such a night at close of many years, In speaking of a future book of mine, It would have pleased me better as a hope, Than as an actual grace it can at all: That's sad, I'm thinking.” “Ay,” he said, “'tis night.” “And there,” I added lightly, “are the stars! And here, we'll talk of stars and not of books.” “You have the stars,” he murmured,—“it is well: Be like them! shine, Aurora, on my dark, Though high and cold and only like a star, And for this short night only,—you, who keep The same Aurora of the bright June-day That withered up the flowers before my face, And turned me from the garden evermore Because I was not worthy. Oh, deserved, Deserved! that I, who verily had not learnt God's lesson half, attaining as a dunce To obliterate good words with fractious thumbs And cheat myself of the context,—I should push Aside, with male ferocious impudence, The world's Aurora who had conned her part On the other side the leaf! ignore her so, Because she was a woman and a queen, And had no beard to bristle through her song, My teacher, who has taught me with a book, My Miriam, whose sweet mouth, when nearly drowned I still heard singing on the shore! Deserved, That here I should look up unto the stars And miss the glory” . . . “Can I understand?” I broke in. “You speak wildly, Romney Leigh, Or I hear wildly. In that morning-time We recollect, the roses were too red, The trees too green, reproach too natural If one should see not what the other saw: And now, it's night, remember; we have shades In place of colours; we are now grown cold, And old, my cousin Romney. Pardon me,— I'm very happy that you like my book, And very sorry that I quoted back A ten years' birthday. 'Twas so mad a thing In any woman, I scarce marvel much You took it for a venturous piece of spite, Provoking such excuses as indeed I cannot call you slack in.” “Understand,” He answered sadly, “something, if but so. This night is softer than an English day, And men may well come hither when they're sick, To draw in easier breath from larger air. 'Tis thus with me; I come to you,—to you My Italy of women, just to breathe My soul out once before you, ere I go, As humble as God makes me at the last (I thank Him), quite out of the way of men And yours, Aurora,—like a punished child, His cheeks all blurred with tears and naughtiness, To silence in a corner. I am come To speak, beloved” . . . “Wisely, cousin Leigh, And worthily of us both!” “Yes, worthily; For this time I must speak out and confess That I, so truculent in assumption once, So absolute in dogma, proud in aim, And fierce in expectation,—I, who felt The whole world tugging at my skirts for help, As if no other man than I could pull, Nor woman but I led her by the hand, Nor cloth hold but I had it in my coat, Do know myself to-night for what I was On that June-day, Aurora. Poor bright day, Which meant the best . . . a woman and a rose, And which I smote upon the cheek with words Until it turned and rent me! Young you were, That birthday, poet, but you talked the right: While I, . . . I built up follies like a wall To intercept the sunshine and your face. Your face! that's worse.” “Speak wisely, cousin Leigh.” “Yes, wisely, dear Aurora, though too late: But then, not wisely. I was heavy then, And stupid, and distracted with the cries Of tortured prisoners in the polished brass Of that Phalarian bull, society, Which seems to bellow bravely like ten bulls, But, if you listen, moans and cries instead Despairingly, like victims tossed and gored And trampled by their hoofs. I heard the cries Too close: I could not hear the angels lift A fold of rustling air, nor what they said To help my pity. I beheld the world As one great famishing carnivorous mouth,— A huge, deserted, callow, blind bird Thing, With piteous open beak that hurt my heart, Till down upon the filthy ground I dropped, And tore the violets up to get the worms. Worms, worms, was all my cry: an open mouth, A gross want, bread to fill it to the lips, No more. That poor men narrowed their demands To such an end, was virtue, I supposed, Adjudicating that to see it so Was reason. Oh, I did not push the case Up higher, and ponder how it answers when The rich take up the same cry for themselves, Professing equally,—‘An open mouth, A gross need, food to fill us, and no more.’ Why that's so far from virtue, only vice Can find excuse for't! that makes libertines, And slurs our cruel streets from end to end With eighty thousand women in one smile, Who only smile at night beneath the gas. The body's satisfaction and no more, Is used for argument against the soul's, Here too; the want, here too, implies the right. —How dark I stood that morning in the sun, My best Aurora (though I saw your eyes), When first you told me . . . oh, I recollect The sound, and how you lifted your small hand, And how your white dress and your burnished curls Went greatening round you in the still blue air, As if an inspiration from within Had blown them all out when you spoke the words, Even these,—‘You will not compass your poor ends ‘Of barley-feeding and material ease, ‘Without the poet's individualism ‘To work your universal. It takes a soul ‘To move a body,—it takes a high-souled man ‘To move the masses, even to a cleaner stye: ‘It takes the ideal, to blow an inch inside ‘The dust of the actual: and your Fouriers failed, ‘Because not poets enough to understand ‘That life develops from within.’ I say Your words,—I could say other words of yours, For none of all your words will let me go; Like sweet verbena which, being brushed against, Will hold us three hours after by the smell In spite of long walks upon windy hills. But these words dealt in sharper perfume,—these Were ever on me, stinging through my dreams, And saying themselves for ever o'er my acts Like some unhappy verdict. That I failed, Is certain. Stye or no stye, to contrive The swine's propulsion toward the precipice, Proved easy and plain. I subtly organised And ordered, built the cards up high and higher, Till, some one breathing, all fell flat again; In setting right society's wide wrong, Mere life's so fatal. So I failed indeed Once, twice, and oftener,—hearing through the rents Of obstinate purpose, still those words of yours, ‘You will not compass your poor ends, not you!’ But harder than you said them; every time Still farther from your voice, until they came To overcrow me with triumphant scorn Which vexed me to resistance. Set down this For condemnation,—I was guilty here; I stood upon my deed and fought my doubt, As men will,—for I doubted,—till at last My deed gave way beneath me suddenly And left me what I am:—the curtain dropped, My part quite ended, all the footlights quenched, My own soul hissing at me through the dark, I ready for confession,—I was wrong, I've sorely failed, I've slipped the ends of life, I yield, you have conquered.” “Stay,” I answered him; “I've something for your hearing, also. I Have failed too.” “You!” he said, “you're very great; The sadness of your greatness fits you well: As if the plume upon a hero's casque Should nod a shadow upon his victor face.” I took him up austerely,—“You have read My book, but not my heart; for recollect, 'Tis a writ in Sanscrit, which you bungle at. I've surely failed, I know, if failure means To look back sadly on work gladly done,— To wander on my Mountains of Delight, So called (I can remember a friend's words As well as you, sir), weary and in want Of even a sheep-path, thinking bitterly . . . Well, well! no matter. I but say so much, To keep you, Romney Leigh, from saying more, And let you feel I am not so high indeed, That I can bear to have you at my foot,— Or safe, that I can help you. That June-day, Too deeply sunk in craterous sunsets now For you or me to dig it up alive,— To pluck it out all bleeding with spent flame At the roots, before those moralising stars We have got instead,—that poor lost day, you said Some words as truthful as the thing of mine You cared to keep in memory; and I hold If I, that day, and being the girl I was, Had shown a gentler spirit, less arrogance, It had not hurt me. You will scarce mistake The point here: I but only think, you see, More justly, that's more humbly, of myself, Than when I tried a crown on and supposed . . . Nay, laugh, sir,—I'll laugh with you!—pray you, laugh, I've had so many birthdays since that day I've learnt to prize mirth's opportunities, Which come too seldom. Was it you who said I was not changed? the same Aurora? Ah, We could laugh there, too! Why, Ulysses' dog Knew him, and wagged his tail and died: but if I had owned a dog, I too, before my Troy, And if you brought him here, . . . I warrant you He'd look into my face, bark lustily, And live on stoutly, as the creatures will Whose spirits are not troubled by long loves. A dog would never know me, I'm so changed, Much less a friend . . . except that you're misled By the colour of the hair, the trick of the voice, Like that Aurora Leigh's.” “Sweet trick of voice! I would be a dog for this, to know it at last, And die upon the falls of it. O love, O best Aurora! are you then so sad You scarcely had been sadder as my wife?” “Your wife, sir! I must certainly be changed, If I, Aurora, can have said a thing So light, it catches at the knightly spurs Of a noble gentleman like Romney Leigh, And trips him from his honourable sense Of what befits” . . . “You wholly misconceive,” He answered. I returned,—“I'm glad of it. But keep from misconception, too, yourself: I am not humbled to so low a point, Not so far saddened. If I am sad at all, Ten layers of birthdays on a woman's head Are apt to fossilise her girlish mirth, Though ne'er so merry: I'm perforce more wise, And that, in truth, means sadder. For the rest, Look here, sir: I was right upon the whole That birthday morning. 'Tis impossible To get at men excepting through their souls, However open their carnivorous jaws; And poets get directlier at the soul Than any of your œconomists—for which You must not overlook the poet's work When scheming for the world's necessities. The soul's the way. Not even Christ Himself Can save man else than as He holds man's soul; And therefore did He come into our flesh, As some wise hunter creeping on his knees, With a torch, into the blackness of a cave, To face and quell the beast there—take the soul, And so possess the whole man, body and soul. I said, so far, right, yes: not farther, though: We both were wrong that June-day—both as wrong As an east wind had been. I who talked of art, And you who grieved for all men's griefs . . . what then? We surely made too small a part for God In these things. What we are, imports us more Than what we eat; and life, you've granted me, Develops from within. But innermost Of the inmost, most interior of the interne, God claims His own, Divine humanity Renewing nature, or the piercingest verse Pressed in by subtlest poet, still must keep As much upon the outside of a man As the very bowl in which he dips his beard. —And then, . . . the rest; I cannot surely speak: Perhaps I doubt more than you doubted then, If I the poet's veritable charge Have borne upon my forehead. If I have, It might feel somewhat liker to a crown, The foolish green one even.—Ah, I think, And chiefly when the sun shines, that I've failed. But what then, Romney? Though we fail indeed, You . . . I . . . a score of such weak workers, . . . He Fails never. If He cannot work by us, He will work over us. Does He want a man, Much less a woman, think you? Every time The star winks there, so many souls are born, Who all shall work too. Let our own be calm: We should be ashamed to sit beneath those stars, Impatient that we're nothing.” “Could we sit Just so for ever, sweetest friend,” he said, “My failure would seem better than success. And yet indeed your book has dealt with me More gently, cousin, than you ever will! Your book brought down entire the bright June-day, And set me wandering in the garden-walks, And let me watch the garland in a place You blushed so . . . nay, forgive me, do not stir,— I only thank the book for what it taught, And what permitted. Poet, doubt yourself, But never doubt that you're a poet to me From henceforth. You have written poems, sweet, Which moved me in secret, as the sap is moved In still March-branches, signless as a stone: But this last book o'ercame me like soft rain Which falls at midnight, when the tightened bark Breaks out into unhesitating buds And sudden protestations of the spring. In all your other books, I saw but you: A man may see the moon so, in a pond, And not be nearer therefore to the moon, Nor use the sight . . . except to drown himself: And so I forced my heart back from the sight, For what had I, I thought, to do with her, Aurora . . . Romney? But, in this last book, You showed me something separate from yourself, Beyond you, and I bore to take it in And let it draw me. You have shown me truths, O June-day friend, that help me now at night, When June is over! truths not yours, indeed, But set within my reach by means of you, Presented by your voice and verse the way To take them clearest. Verily I was wrong; And verily many thinkers of this age, Ay, many Christian teachers, half in heaven, Are wrong in just my sense who understood Our natural world too insularly, as if No spiritual counterpart completed it, Consummating its meaning, rounding all To justice and perfection, line by line, Form by form, nothing single nor alone, The great below clenched by the great above, Shade here authenticating substance there, The body proving spirit, as the effect The cause: we meantime being too grossly apt To hold the natural, as dogs a bone (Though reason and nature beat us in the face), So obstinately, that we'll break our teeth Or ever we let go. For everywhere We're too materialistic,—eating clay (Like men of the west) instead of Adam's corn And Noah's wine—clay by handfuls, clay by lumps, Until we're filled up to the throat with clay, And grow the grimy colour of the ground On which we are feeding. Ay, materialist The age's name is. God Himself, with some, Is apprehended as the bare result Of what His hand materially has made, Expressed in such an algebraic sign Called God—that is, to put it otherwise, They add up nature to a nought of God And cross the quotient. There are many even, Whose names are written in the Christian Church To no dishonour, diet still on mud And splash the altars with it. You might think The clay Christ laid upon their eyelids when, Still blind, He called them to the use of sight, Remained there to retard its exercise With clogging incrustations. Close to heaven, They see for mysteries, through the open doors, Vague puffs of smoke from pots of earthenware, And fain would enter, when their time shall come, With quite another body than Saint Paul Has promised—husk and chaff, the whole barley-corn Or where's the resurrection?” “Thus it is,” I sighed. And he resumed with mournful face, “Beginning so, and filling up with clay The wards of this great key, the natural world, And fumbling vainly therefore at the lock Of the spiritual, we feel ourselves shut in With all the wild-beast roar of struggling life, The terrors and compunctions of our souls, As saints with lions,—we who are not saints, And have no heavenly lordship in our stare To awe them backward. Ay, we are forced, so pent, To judge the whole too partially, . . . confound Conclusions. Is there any common phrase Significant, with the adverb heard alone, The verb being absent, and the pronoun out? But we, distracted in the roar of life, Still insolently at God's adverb snatch, And bruit against Him that His thought is void, His meaning hopeless,—cry, that everywhere The government is slipping from His hand, Unless some other Christ (say Romney Leigh) Come up and toil and moil and change the world, Because the First has proved inadequate, However we talk bigly of His work And piously of His person. We blaspheme At last, to finish our doxology, Despairing on the earth for which He died.” “So now,” I asked, “you have more hope of men?” “I hope,” he answered. “I am come to think That God will have His work done, as you said, And that we need not be disturbed too much For Romney Leigh or others having failed With this or that quack nostrum—recipes For keeping summits by annulling depths, For wrestling with luxurious lounging sleeves, And acting heroism without a scratch. We fail,—what then? Aurora, if I smiled To see you, in your lovely morning-pride, Try on the poet's wreath which suits the noon (Sweet cousin, walls must get the weather stain Before they grow the ivy!), certainly I stood myself there worthier of contempt, Self-rated, in disastrous arrogance, As competent to sorrow for mankind, And even their odds. A man may well despair Who counts himself so needful to success. I failed: I throw the remedy back on God, And sit down here beside you, in good hope.” “And yet take heed,” I answered, “lest we lean Too dangerously on the other side, And so fail twice. Be sure, no earnest work Of any honest creature, howbeit weak, Imperfect, ill-adapted, fails so much, It is not gathered as a grain of sand To enlarge the sum of human action used For carrying out God's end. No creature works So ill, observe, that therefore he's cashiered. The honest, earnest man must stand and work, The woman also—otherwise she drops At once below the dignity of man, Accepting serfdom. Free men freely work. Whoever fears God, fears to sit at ease.” He cried: “True. After Adam, work was curse: The natural creature labours, sweats, and frets. But, after Christ, work turns to privilege, And henceforth, one with our humanity, The Six-day Worker working still in us Has called us freely to work on with Him In high companionship. So, happiest! I count that heaven itself is only work To a surer issue. Let us work, indeed, But no more work as Adam,—nor as Leigh Erewhile, as if the only man on earth, Responsible for all the thistles blown And tigers couchant, struggling in amaze Against disease and winter, snarling on For ever that the world's not paradise. O cousin, let us be content, in work, To do the thing we can, and not presume To fret because it's little. 'Twill employ Seven men, they say, to make a perfect pin: Who makes the head, content to miss the point; Who makes the point, agreed to leave the join: And if a man should cry ‘I want a pin, ‘And I must make it straightway, head and point,’ His wisdom is not worth the pin he wants Seven men to a pin,—and not a man too much! Seven generations, haply, to this world, To right it visibly a finger's breadth, And mend its rents a little. Oh, to storm And say ‘This world here is intolerable; ‘I will not eat this corn, nor drink this wine, ‘Nor love this woman, flinging her my soul ‘Without a bond for't as a lover should, ‘Nor use the generous leave of happiness ‘As not too good for using generously’— (Since virtue kindles at the touch of joy Like a man's cheek laid on a woman's hand, And God, Who knows it, looks for quick returns From joys)—to stand and claim to have a life Beyond the bounds of the individual man, And raze all personal cloisters of the soul To build up public stores and magazines, As if God's creatures otherwise were lost, The builder surely saved by any means! To think,—I have a pattern on my nail, And I will carve the world new after it And solve so these hard social questions—nay, Impossible social questions, since their roots Strike deep in Evil's own existence here, Which God permits because the question's hard To abolish evil nor attaint free-will. Ay, hard to God, but not to Romney Leigh! For Romney has a pattern on his nail (Whatever may be lacking on the Mount), And, not being over-nice to separate What's element from what's convention, hastes By line on line to draw you out a world, Without your help indeed, unless you take His yoke upon you, and will learn of him, So much he has to teach! so good a world! The same the whole creation's groaning for! No rich nor poor, no gain nor loss nor stint; No pottage in it able to exclude A brother's birthright, and no right of birth The pottage—both secured to every man, And perfect virtue dealt out like the rest Gratuitously, with the soup at six, To whoso does not seek it.” “Softly, sir,” I interrupted,—“I had a cousin once I held in reverence. If he strained too wide, It was not to take honour, but give help; The gesture was heroic. If his hand Accomplished nothing . . . (well, it is not proved) That empty hand thrown impotently out Were sooner caught, I think, by One in heaven, Than many a hand that reaped a harvest in, And keeps the scythe's glow on it. Pray you, then, For my sake merely, use less bitterness In speaking of my cousin.” “Ah,” he said, “Aurora! when the prophet beats the ass, The angel intercedes.” He shook his head— “And yet to mean so well and fail so foul, Expresses ne'er another beast than man; The antithesis is human. Hearken, dear; There's too much abstract willing, purposing, In this poor world. We talk by aggregates, And think by systems, and, being used to face Our evils in statistics, are inclined To cap them with unreal remedies Drawn out in haste on the other side the slate.” “That's true,” I answered, fain to throw up thought And make a game of't. “Yes, we generalise Enough to please you. If we pray at all, We pray no longer for our daily bread, But next centenary's harvests. If we give, Our cup of water is not tendered till We lay down pipes and found a Company With Branches. Ass or angel, 'tis the same: A woman cannot do the thing she ought, Which means whatever perfect thing she can, In life, in art, in science, but she fears To let the perfect action take her part, And rest there: she must prove what she can do Before she does it, prate of woman's rights, Of woman's mission, woman's function, till The men (who are prating too on their side) cry, ‘A woman's function plainly is . . . to talk.’ Poor souls, they are very reasonably vexed; They cannot hear each other talk.” “And you, An artist, judge so?” “I, an artist—yes: Because, precisely, I'm an artist, sir, And woman, if another sat in sight, I'd whisper,—Soft, my sister! not a word! By speaking we prove only we can speak, Which he, the man here, never doubted. What He doubts is, whether we can do the thing With decent grace we've not yet done at all. Now, do it; bring your statue,—you have room! He'll see it even by the starlight here; And if 'tis e'er so little like the god Who looks out from the marble silently Along the track of his own shining dart Through the dusk of ages, there's no need to speak; The universe shall henceforth speak for you, And witness, ‘She who did this thing was born To do it—claims her license in her work.’ And so with more works. Whoso cures the plague, Though twice a woman, shall be called a leech: Who rights a land's finances is excused For touching coppers, though her hands be white. But we, we talk!” “It is the age's mood,” He said; “we boast, and do not. We put up Hostelry signs where'er we lodge a day,— Some red colossal cow with mighty paps A Cyclops' fingers could not strain to milk,— Then bring out presently our saucerful Of curds. We want more quiet in our works, More knowledge of the bounds in which we work; More knowledge that each individual man Remains an Adam to the general race, Constrained to see, like Adam, that he keep His personal state's condition honestly, Or vain all thoughts of his to help the world, Which still must be developed from its one If bettered in its many. We indeed, Who think to lay it out new like a park, We take a work on us which is not man's, For God alone sits far enough above To speculate so largely. None of us (Not Romney Leigh) is mad enough to say, We'll have a grove of oaks upon that slope And sink the need of acorns. Government, If veritable and lawful, is not given By imposition of the foreign hand, Nor chosen from a pretty pattern-book Of some domestic idealogue who sits And coldly chooses empire, where as well He might republic. Genuine government Is but the expression of a nation, good Or less good—even as all society, Howe'er unequal, monstrous, crazed and cursed, Is but the expression of men's single lives, The loud sum of the silent units. What, We'd change the aggregate and yet retain Each separate figure? whom do we cheat by that? Now, not even Romney.” “Cousin, you are sad. Did all your social labour at Leigh Hall, And elsewhere, come to nought, then?” “It was nought,” He answered mildly. “There is room, indeed, For statues still in this large world of God's, But not for vacuums; so I am not sad— Not sadder than is good for what I am. My vain phalanstery dissolved itself; My men and women of disordered lives I brought in orderly to dine and sleep, Broke up those waxen masks I made them wear, With fierce contortions of the natural face, And cursed me for my tyrannous constraint In forcing crooked creatures to live straight; And set the country hounds upon my back To bite and tear me for my wicked deed Of trying to do good without the church Or even the squires, Aurora. Do you mind Your ancient neighbours? The great book-club teems With ‘sketches,’ ‘summaries,’ and ‘last tracts’ but twelve, On socialistic troublers of close bonds Betwixt the generous rich and grateful poor. The vicar preached from ‘Revelations’ (till The doctor woke), and found me with ‘the frogs’ On three successive Sundays; ay, and stopped To weep a little (for he's getting old) That such perdition should o'ertake a man Of such fair acres—in the parish, too! He printed his discourses ‘by request,’ And if your book shall sell as his did, then Your verses are less good than I suppose. The women of the neighbourhood subscribed, And sent me a copy, bound in scarlet silk, Tooled edges, blazoned with the arms of Leigh: I own that touched me.” “What, the pretty ones? Poor Romney!” “Otherwise the effect was small: I had my windows broken once or twice By liberal peasants naturally incensed At such a vexer of Arcadian peace, Who would not let men call their wives their own To kick like Britons, and made obstacles When things went smoothly as a baby drugged, Toward freedom and starvation—bringing down The wicked London tavern-thieves and drabs To affront the blessed hillside drabs and thieves With mended morals, quotha—fine new lives!— My windows paid for't. I was shot at, once, By an active poacher who had hit a hare From the other barrel (tired of springeing game So long upon my acres, undisturbed, And restless for the country's virtue—yet He missed me); ay, and pelted very oft In riding through the village. ‘There he goes ‘Who'd drive away our Christian gentlefolk, ‘To catch us undefended in the trap ‘He baits with poisonous cheese, and lock us up ‘In that pernicious prison of Leigh Hall ‘With all his murderers! Give another name ‘And say Leigh Hell, and burn it up with fire.’ And so they did, at last, Aurora.” “Did?” “You never heard it, cousin? Vincent's news Came stinted, then.” “They did? they burnt Leigh Hall?” “You're sorry, dear Aurora? Yes, indeed, They did it perfectly: a thorough work, And not a failure, this time. Let us grant 'Tis somewhat easier, though, to burn a house Than build a system; yet that's easy too In a dream. Books, pictures—ay, the pictures! What, You think your dear Vandykes would give them pause? Our proud ancestral Leighs, with those peaked beards, Or bosoms white as foam thrown up on rocks From the old-spent wave. Such calm defiant looks They flared up with! now nevermore to twit The bones in the family vault with ugly death. Not one was rescued, save the Lady Maud, Who threw you down, that morning you were born, The undeniable lineal mouth and chin To wear for ever for her gracious sake, For which good deed I saved her; the rest went: And you, you're sorry, cousin. Well, for me, With all my phalansterians safely out (Poor hearts, they helped the burners, it was said, And certainly a few clapped hands and yelled), The ruin did not hurt me as it might— As when for instance I was hurt one day A certain letter being destroyed. In fact, To see the great house flare so . . . oaken floors Our fathers made so fine with rushes once Before our mothers furbished them with trains, Carved wainscots, panelled walls, the favourite slide For draining off a martyr (or a rogue), The echoing galleries, half a half-mile long, And all the various stairs that took you up And took you down, and took you round about Upon their slippery darkness, recollect, All helping to keep up one blazing jest! The flames through all the casements pushing forth, Like red-hot devils crinkled into snakes, All signifying ‘Look you, Romney Leigh, ‘We save the people from your saving, here, ‘Yet so as by fire! we make a pretty show ‘Besides—and that's the best you've ever done.’ —To see this, almost moved myself to clap! The ‘vale et plaude’ came too with effect When in the roof fell, and the fire that paused, Stunned momently beneath the stroke of slates And tumbling rafters, rose at once and roared, And wrapping the whole house (which disappeared In a mounting whirlwind of dilated flame), Blew upward, straight, its drift of fiery chaff In the face of Heaven, which blenched, and ran up higher.” “Poor Romney!” “Sometimes when I dream,” he said, “I hear the silence after, 'twas so still. For all those wild beasts, yelling, cursing round, Were suddenly silent, while you counted five, So silent, that you heard a young bird fall From the top nest in the neighbouring rookery, Through edging over-rashly toward the light. The old rooks had already fled too far To hear the screech they fled with, though you saw Some flying still, like scatterings of dead leaves In autumn-gusts, seen dark against the sky,— All flying,—ousted, like the House of Leigh.” “Dear Romney!” “Evidently 'twould have been A fine sight for a poet, sweet, like you, To make the verse blaze after. I myself, Even I, felt something in the grand old trees, Which stood that moment like brute Druid gods Amazed upon the rim of ruin, where, As into a blackened socket, the great fire Had dropped, still throwing up splinters now and then To show them grey with all their centuries, Left there to witness that on such a day The House went out.” “Ah!” “While you counted five, I seemed to feel a little like a Leigh,— But then it passed, Aurora. A child cried, And I had enough to think of what to do With all those houseless wretches in the dark, And ponder where they'd dance the next time, they Who had burnt the viol.” “Did you think of that? Who burns his viol will not dance, I know, To cymbals, Romney.” “O my sweet, sad voice!” He cried,—“O voice that speaks and overcomes! The sun is silent, but Aurora speaks.” “Alas,” I said, “I speak I know not what: I'm back in childhood, thinking as a child, A foolish fancy—will it make you smile? I shall not from the window of my room Catch sight of those old chimneys any more.” “No more,” he answered. “If you pushed one day Through all the green hills to our fathers' house, You'd come upon a great charred circle, where The patient earth was singed an acre round; With one stone stair, symbolic of my life, Ascending, winding, leading up to nought! 'Tis worth a poet's seeing. Will you go?” I made no answer. Had I any right To weep with this man, that I dared to speak? A woman stood between his soul and mine, And waved us off from touching evermore, With those unclean white hands of hers. Enough. We had burnt our viols, and were silent. So, The silence lengthened till it pressed. I spoke, To breathe: “I think you were ill afterward.” “More ill,” he answered, “had been scarcely ill. I hoped this feeble fumbling at life's knot Might end concisely,—but I failed to die, As formerly I failed to live,—and thus Grew willing, having tried all other ways, To try just God's. Humility's so good, When pride's impossible. Mark us, how we make Our virtues, cousin, from our worn-out sins, Which smack of them from henceforth. Is it right, For instance, to wed here while you love there? And yet because a man sins once, the sin Cleaves to him, in necessity to sin, That if he sin not so to damn himself, He sins so, to damn others with himself: And thus, to wed here, loving there, becomes A duty. Virtue buds a dubious leaf Round mortal brows; your ivy's better, dear. —Yet she, 'tis certain, is my very wife, The very lamb left mangled by the wolves Through my own bad shepherding: and could I choose But take her on my shoulder past this stretch Of rough, uneasy wilderness, poor lamb, Poor child, poor child?—Aurora, my beloved, I will not vex you any more to-night, But, having spoken what I came to say, The rest shall please you. What she can, in me— Protection, tender liking, freedom, ease— She shall have surely, liberally, for her And hers, Aurora. Small amends they'll make For hideous evils which she had not known Except by me, and for this imminent loss, This forfeit presence of a gracious friend, Which also she must forfeit for my sake, Since, . . . drop your hand in mine a moment, sweet, We're parting!—Ah, my snowdrop, what a touch, As if the wind had swept it off! You grudge Your gelid sweetness on my palm but so, A moment? Angry, that I could not bear You . . . speaking, breathing, living, side by side With some one called my wife . . . and live, myself? Nay, be not cruel—you must understand! Your lightest footfall on a floor of mine Would shake the house, my lintel being uncrossed 'Gainst angels: henceforth it is night with me, And so, henceforth, I put the shutters up: Auroras must not come to spoil my dark.” He smiled so feebly, with an empty hand Stretched sideway from me—as indeed he looked To any one but me to give him help; And, while the moon came suddenly out full, The double-rose of our Italian moons, Sufficient plainly for the heaven and earth (The stars struck dumb and washed away in dews Of golden glory, and the mountains steeped In divine languor), he, the man, appeared So pale and patient, like the marble man A sculptor puts his personal sadness in To join his grandeur of ideal thought, As if his mallet struck me from my height Of passionate indignation, I who had risen Pale, doubting paused . . . Was Romney mad indeed? Had all this wrong of heart made sick the brain? Then quiet, with a sort of tremulous pride, “Go, cousin,” I said coldly; “a farewell Was sooner spoken 'twixt a pair of friends In those old days, than seems to suit you now. Howbeit, since then, I've writ a book or two, I'm somewhat dull still in the manly art Of phrase and metaphrase. Why, any man Can carve a score of white Loves out of snow, As Buonarroti in my Florence there, And set them on the wall in some safe shade, As safe, sir, as your marriage! very good; Though if a woman took one from the ledge To put it on the table by her flowers And let it mind her of a certain friend, 'Twould drop at once (so better), would not bear Her nail-mark even, where she took it up A little tenderly,—so best, I say: For me, I would not touch the fragile thing And risk to spoil it half an hour before The sun shall shine to melt it: leave it there. I'm plain at speech, direct in purpose: when I speak, you'll take the meaning as it is, And not allow for puckerings in the silk By clever stitches. I'm a woman, sir— I use the woman's figures naturally, As you the male license. So, I wish you well. I'm simply sorry for the griefs you've had, And not for your sake only, but mankind's. This race is never grateful: from the first, One fills their cup at supper with pure wine, Which back they give at cross-time on a sponge, In vinegar and gall.” “If gratefuller,” He murmured, “by so much less pitiable! God's self would never have come down to die, Could man have thanked Him for it.” “Happily 'Tis patent that, whatever,” I resumed, “You suffered from this thanklessness of men, You sink no more than Moses' bulrush-boat When once relieved of Moses,—for you're light, You're light, my cousin! which is well for you, And manly. For myself, now mark me, sir, They burnt Leigh Hall; but if, consummated To devils, heightened beyond Lucifers, They had burnt, instead, a star or two of those We saw above there just a moment back, Before the moon abolished them,—destroyed And riddled them in ashes through a sieve On the head of the foundering universe—what then? If you and I remained still you and I, It could not shift our places as mere friends, Nor render decent you should toss a phrase Beyond the point of actual feeling! Nay, You shall not interrupt me: as you said, We're parting. Certainly, not once nor twice To-night you've mocked me somewhat, or yourself, And I, at least, have not deserved it so That I should meet it unsurprised. But now, Enough: we're parting . . . parting. Cousin Leigh, I wish you well through all the acts of life And life's relations, wedlock not the least, And it shall ‘please me,’ in your words, to know You yield your wife, protection, freedom, ease, And very tender liking. May you live So happy with her, Romney, that your friends Shall praise her for it! Meantime some of us Are wholly dull in keeping ignorant Of what she has suffered by you, and what debt Of sorrow your rich love sits down to pay: But if 'tis sweet for love to pay its debt, 'Tis sweeter still for love to give its gift, And you, be liberal in the sweeter way, You can, I think. At least, as touches me, You owe her, cousin Romney, no amends: She is not used to hold my gown so fast, You need entreat her now to let it go; The lady never was a friend of mine, Nor capable,—I thought you knew as much,— Of losing for your sake so poor a prize As such a worthless friendship. Be content, Good cousin, therefore, both for her and you! I'll never spoil your dark, nor dull your noon, Nor vex you when you're merry, or at rest: You shall not need to put a shutter up To keep out this Aurora,—though your north Can make Auroras which vex nobody, Scarce known from night, I fancied! let me add, My larks fly higher than some windows. Well, You've read your Leighs. Indeed, 'twould shake a house, If such as I came in with outstretched hand, Still warm and thrilling from the clasp of one . . . Of one we know, . . . to acknowledge, palm to palm, As mistress there, the Lady Waldemar.” “Now God be with us” . . . with a sudden clash Of voice he interrupted. “What name's that? You spoke a name, Aurora.” “Pardon me; I would that, Romney, I could name your wife Nor wound you, yet be worthy.” “Are we mad?” He echoed. “Wife! mine! Lady Waldemar! I think you said my wife.” He sprang to his feet, And threw his noble head back toward the moon As one who swims against a stormy sea, Then laughed with such a helpless, hopeless scorn, I stood and trembled. “May God judge me so,” He said at last,—“I came convicted here, And humbled sorely if not enough. I came, Because this woman from her crystal soul Had shown me something which a man calls light: Because too, formerly, I sinned by her As then and ever since I have, by God, Through arrogance of nature,—though I loved . . . Whom best, I need not say, since that is writ Too plainly in the book of my misdeeds: And thus I came here to abase myself, And fasten, kneeling, on her regent brows A garland which I startled thence one day Of her beautiful June-youth. But here again I'm baffled,—fail in my abasement as My aggrandisement: there's no room left for me At any woman's foot who misconceives My nature, purpose, possible actions. What! Are you the Aurora who made large my dreams To frame your greatness? you conceive so small? You stand so less than woman through being more, And lose your natural instinct (like a beast) Through intellectual culture? since indeed I do not think that any common she Would dare adopt such monstrous forgeries For the legible life signature of such As I, with all my blots—with all my blots! At last, then, peerless cousin, we are peers— At last we're even. Ay, you've left your height, And here upon my level we take hands, And here I reach you to forgive you, sweet, And that's a fall, Aurora. Long ago You seldom understood me,—but before, I could not blame you. Then, you only seemed So high above, you could not see below; But now I breathe,—but now I pardon!—nay, We're parting. Dearest, men have burnt my house, Maligned my motives; but not one, I swear, Has wronged my soul as this Aurora has Who called the Lady Waldemar my wife.” “Not married to her! yet you said” . . . “Again? Nay, read the lines” (he held a letter out) “She sent you through me.” By the moonlight there I tore the meaning out with passionate haste Much rather than I read it. Thus it ran. NINTH BOOK. Even thus. I pause to write it out at length, The letter of the Lady Waldemar. “I prayed your cousin Leigh to take you this: He says he'll do it. After years of love, Or what is called so, when a woman frets And fools upon one string of a man's name, And fingers it for ever till it breaks,— He may perhaps do for her such a thing, And she accept it without detriment Although she should not love him any more. And I, who do not love him, nor love you, Nor you, Aurora,—choose you shall repent Your most ungracious letter and confess, Constrained by his convictions (he's convinced), You've wronged me foully. Are you made so ill, You woman, to impute such ill to me? We both had mothers,—lay in their bosom once. And after all, I thank you, Aurora Leigh, For proving to myself that there are things I would not do—not for my life, nor him, Though something I have somewhat overdone,— For instance, when I went to see the gods One morning on Olympus, with a step That shook the thunder from a certain cloud, Committing myself vilely. Could I think, The Muse I pulled my heart out from my breast To soften, had herself a sort of heart, And loved my mortal? He at least loved her,— I heard him say so: 'twas my recompense, When, watching at his bedside fourteen days, He broke out ever like a flame at whiles Between the heats of fever,—‘Is it thou? ‘Breathe closer, sweetest mouth!’ and when at last, The fever gone, the wasted face extinct, As if it irked him much to know me there, He said ‘'Twas kind, 'twas good, 'twas womanly,’ (And fifty praises to excuse no love); ‘But was the picture safe he had ventured for?’ And then, half wandering, ‘I have loved her well, ‘Although she could not love me.’—‘Say, instead,’ I answered, ‘she does love you.’—'Twas my turn To rave: I would have married him so changed, Although the world had jeered me properly For taking up with Cupid at his worst, The silver quiver worn off on his hair. ‘No, no,’ he murmured; ‘no, she loves me not; ‘Aurora Leigh does better: bring her book ‘And read it softly, Lady Waldemar, ‘Until I thank your friendship more for that ‘Than even for harder service.’ So I read Your book, Aurora, for an hour that day: I kept its pauses, marked its emphasis; My voice, impaled upon its hooks of rhyme, Not once would writhe, nor quiver, nor revolt; I read on calmly,—calmly shut it up, Observing, ‘There's some merit in the book; ‘And yet the merit in't is thrown away, ‘As chances still with women if we write ‘Or write not: we want string to tie our flowers, ‘So drop them as we walk, which serves to show ‘The way we went. Good morning, Mister Leigh; ‘You'll find another reader the next time. ‘A woman who does better than to love, ‘I hate; she will do nothing very well: ‘Male poets are preferable, straining less ‘And teaching more.’ I triumphed o'er you both, And left him. “When I saw him afterward I had read your shameful letter, and my heart. He came with health recovered, strong though pale, Lord Howe and he, a courteous pair of friends, To say what men dare say to women, when Their debtors. But I stopped them with a word, And proved I had never trodden such a road To carry so much dirt upon my shoe. Then, putting into it something of disdain, I asked, forsooth, his pardon, and my own, For having done no better than to love, And that not wisely,—though 'twas long ago, And had been mended radically since. I told him, as I tell you now, Miss Leigh, And proved, I took some trouble for his sake (Because I knew he did not love the girl) To spoil my hands with working in the stream Of that poor bubbling nature,—till she went, Consigned to one I trusted, my own maid Who once had lived full five months in my house (Dressed hair superbly), with a lavish purse, To carry to Australia, where she had left A husband, said she. If the creature lied, The mission failed: we all do fail and lie More or less—and I'm sorry—which is all Expected from us when we fail the most And go to church to own it. What I meant, Was just the best for him, and me, and her . . . Best even for Marian!—I am sorry for't, And very sorry. Yet my creature said She saw her stop to speak in Oxford Street To one . . . no matter! I had sooner cut My hand off (though 'twere kissed the hour before, And promised a duke's troth-ring for the next) Than crush her silly head with so much wrong. Poor child! I would have mended it with gold, Until it gleamed like Saint Sophia's dome When all the faithful troop to morning prayer: But he, he nipped the bud of such a thought With that cold Leigh look which I fancied once, And broke in, ‘Henceforth she was called his wife: ‘His wife required no succour: he was bound ‘To Florence, to resume this broken bond; ‘Enough so. Both were happy, he and Howe, ‘To acquit me of the heaviest charge of all—’ —At which I shot my tongue against my fly And struck him: ‘Would he carry—he was just— ‘A letter from me to Aurora Leigh, ‘And ratify from his authentic mouth ‘My answer to her accusation?’—‘Yes, ‘If such a letter were prepared in time.’ —He's just, your cousin,—ay, abhorrently: He'd wash his hands in blood, to keep them clean. And so, cold, courteous, a mere gentleman, He bowed, we parted. “Parted. Face no more, Voice no more, love no more!—wiped wholly out Like some ill scholar's scrawl from heart and slate,— Ay, spit on, and so wiped out utterly By some coarse scholar! I have been too coarse, Too human. Have we business, in our rank, With blood i' the veins? I will have henceforth none, Not even to keep the colour at my lip. A rose is pink and pretty without blood: Why not a woman? When we've played in vain The game, to adore,—we have resources still, And can play on at leisure, being adored: Here's Smith already swearing at my feet That I'm the typic She. Away with Smith!— Smith smacks of Leigh,—and henceforth I'll admit No socialist within three crinolines, To live and have his being. But for you, Though insolent your letter and absurd, And though I hate you frankly,—take my Smith! For when you have seen this famous marriage tied, A most unspotted Erle to a noble Leigh (His love astray on one he should not love), Howbeit you may not want his love, beware, You'll want some comfort. So I leave you Smith, Take Smith!—he talks Leigh's subjects, somewhat worse; Adopts a thought of Leigh's, and dwindles it; Goes leagues beyond, to be no inch behind; Will mind you of him, as a shoe-string may Of a man: and women, when they are made like you, Grow tender to a shoe-string, footprint even, Adore averted shoulders in a glass, And memories of what, present once, was loathed. And yet, you loathed not Romney,—though you played At ‘fox and goose’ about him with your soul; Pass over fox, you rub out fox,—ignore A feeling, you eradicate it,—the act's Identical. “I wish you joy, Miss Leigh; You've made a happy marriage for your friend, And all the honour well-assorted love Derives from you who love him, whom he loves! You need not wish me joy to think of it; I have so much. Observe, Aurora Leigh, Your droop of eyelid is the same as his, And, but for you, I might have won his love, And, to you, I have shown my naked heart; For which three things, I hate, hate, hate you. Hush! Suppose a fourth!—I cannot choose but think That, with him, I were virtuouser than you Without him: so I hate you from this gulf And hollow of my soul, which opens out To what, except for you, had been my heaven, And is, instead, a place to curse by! Love.” An active kind of curse. I stood there cursed, Confounded. I had seized and caught the sense Of the letter, with its twenty stinging snakes, In a moment's sweep of eyesight, and I stood Dazed.—“Ah! not married.” “You mistake,” he said: “I'm married. Is not Marian Erle my wife? As God sees things, I have a wife and child; And I, as I'm a man who honours God, Am here to claim them as my child and wife.” I felt it hard to breathe, much less to speak. Nor word of mine was needed. Some one else Was there for answering. “Romney,” she began, “My great good angel, Romney.” Then at first, I knew that Marian Erle was beautiful. She stood there, still and pallid as a saint, Dilated, like a saint in ecstasy, As if the floating moonshine interposed Betwixt her foot and the earth, and raised her up To float upon it. “I had left my child, Who sleeps,” she said, “and having drawn this way, I heard you speaking, . . . friend!—Confirm me now. You take this Marian, such as wicked men Have made her, for your honourable wife?” The thrilling, solemn, proud, pathetic voice. He stretched his arms out toward that thrilling voice, As if to draw it on to his embrace. —“I take her as God made her, and as men Must fail to unmake her, for my honoured wife.” She never raised her eyes, nor took a step, But stood there in her place, and spoke again. —“You take this Marian's child, which is her shame In sight of men and women, for your child, Of whom you will not ever feel ashamed?” The thrilling, tender, proud, pathetic voice. He stepped on toward it, still with outstretched arms, As if to quench upon his breast that voice. —“May God so father me, as I do him, And so forsake me, as I let him feel He's orphaned haply. Here I take the child To share my cup, to slumber on my knee, To play his loudest gambol at my foot, To hold my finger in the public ways, Till none shall need inquire ‘Whose child is this?’ The gesture saying so tenderly ‘My own.’” She stood a moment silent in her place; Then turning toward me very slow and cold:— ‘And you,—what say you?—will you blame me much, If, careful for that outcast child of mine, I catch this hand that's stretched to me and him, Nor dare to leave him friendless in the world Where men have stoned me? Have I not the right To take so mere an aftermath from life, Else found so wholly bare? Or is it wrong To let your cousin, for a generous bent, Put out his ungloved fingers among briars To set a tumbling bird's nest somewhat straight? You will not tell him, though we're innocent, We are not harmless, . . . and that both our harms Will stick to his good, smooth, noble life like burrs, Never to drop off though he shakes the cloak? You've been my friend: you will not now be his? You've known him that he's worthy of a friend, And you're his cousin, lady, after all, And therefore more than free to take his part, Explaining, since the nest is surely spoilt And Marian what you know her—though a wife, The world would hardly understand her case Of being just hurt and honest; while, for him, 'Twould ever twit him with his bastard child And married harlot. Speak, while yet there's time. You would not stand and let a good man's dog Turn round and rend him, because his, and reared Of a generous breed,—and will you let his act, Because it's generous? Speak. I'm bound to you, And I'll be bound by only you, in this.” The thrilling, solemn voice, so passionless, Sustained, yet low, without a rise or fall, As one who had authority to speak, And not as Marian. I looked up to feel If God stood near me, and beheld His heaven As blue as Aaron's priestly robe appeared To Aaron when he took it off to die. And then I spoke: “Accept the gift, I say, My sister Marian, and be satisfied. The hand that gives has still a soul behind Which will not let it quail for having given, Though foolish worldlings talk they know not what— Of what they know not. Romney's strong enough For this: do you be strong to know he's strong: He stands on Right's side; never flinch for him, As if he stood on the other. You'll be bound By me? I am a woman of repute; No fly-blow gossip ever specked my life; My name is clean and open as this hand, Whose glove there's not a man dares blab about As if he had touched it freely. Here's my hand To clasp your hand, my Marian, owned as pure! As pure—as I'm a woman and a Leigh!— And, as I'm both, I'll witness to the world That Romney Leigh is honoured in his choice Who chooses Marian for his honoured wife.” Her broad wild woodland eyes shot out a light, Her smile was wonderful for rapture. “Thanks, My great Aurora.” Forward then she sprang, And dropping her impassioned spaniel head With all its brown abandonment of curls On Romney's feet, we heard the kisses drawn Through sobs upon the foot, upon the ground— “O Romney! O my angel! O unchanged, Though since we've parted I have passed the grave! But Death itself could only better thee, Not change thee!—Thee I do not thank at all: I but thank God who made thee what thou art, So wholly godlike.” When he tried in vain To raise her to his embrace, escaping thence As any leaping fawn from a huntsman's grasp, She bounded off and 'lighted beyond reach, Before him, with a staglike majesty Of soft, serene defiance,—as she knew He could not touch her, so was tolerant He had cared to try. She stood there with her great Drowned eyes, and dripping cheeks, and strange, sweet smile That lived through all, as if one held a light Across a waste of waters—shook her head To keep some thoughts down deeper in her soul,— Then, white and tranquil like a summer-cloud Which, having rained itself to a tardy peace, Stands still in heaven as if it ruled the day, Spoke out again,—“Although, my generous friend, Since last we met and parted you're unchanged, And having promised faith to Marian Erle, Maintain it, as she were not changed at all; And though that's worthy, though that's full of balm To any conscious spirit of a girl Who once has loved you as I loved you once— Yet still it will not make her . . . if she's dead, And gone away where none can give or take In marriage—able to revive, return And wed you—will it, Romney? Here's the point, My friend, we'll see it plainer: you and I Must never, never, never join hands so. Nay, let me say it—for I said it first To God, and placed it, rounded to an oath, Far, far above the moon there, at His feet, As surely as I wept just now at yours— We never, never, never join hands so. And now, be patient with me; do not think I'm speaking from a false humility. The truth is, I am grown so proud with grief, And He has said so often through His nights And through His mornings, ‘Weep a little still, ‘Thou foolish Marian, because women must, ‘But do not blush at all except for sin’— That I, who felt myself unworthy once Of virtuous Romney and his high-born race, Have come to learn,—a woman, poor or rich, Despised or honoured, is a human soul, And what her soul is, that she is herself, Although she should be spit upon of men, As is the pavement of the churches here, Still good enough to pray in. And being chaste And honest, and inclined to do the right, And love the truth, and live my life out green And smooth beneath his steps, I should not fear To make him thus a less uneasy time Than many a happier woman. Very proud You see me. Pardon, that I set a trap To hear a confirmation in your voice, Both yours and yours. It is so good to know 'Twas really God who said the same before; And thus it is in heaven, that first God speaks, And then His angels. Oh, it does me good, It wipes me clean and sweet from devil's dirt, That Romney Leigh should think me worthy still Of being his true and honourable wife! Henceforth I need not say, on leaving earth, I had no glory in it. For the rest, The reason's ready (master, angel, friend, Be patient with me) wherefore you and I Can never, never, never join hands so. I know you'll not be angry like a man (For you are none) when I shall tell the truth, Which is, I do not love you, Romney Leigh, I do not love you. Ah well! catch my hands, Miss Leigh, and burn into my eyes with yours— I swear I do not love him. Did I once? 'Tis said that women have been bruised to death And yet, if once they loved, that love of theirs Could never be drained out with all their blood: I've heard such things and pondered. Did I indeed Love once; or did I only worship? Yes, Perhaps, O friend, I set you up so high Above all actual good or hope of good Or fear of evil, all that could be mine, I haply set you above love itself, And out of reach of these poor woman's arms, Angelic Romney. What was in my thought? To be your slave, your help, your toy, your tool. To be your love . . . I never thought of that: To give you love . . . still less. I gave you love? I think I did not give you anything; I was but only yours—upon my knees, All yours, in soul and body, in head and heart, A creature you had taken from the ground Still crumbling through your fingers to your feet To join the dust she came from. Did I love, Or did I worship? judge, Aurora Leigh! But, if indeed I loved, 'twas long ago— So long! before the sun and moon were made, Before the hells were open,—ah, before I heard my child cry in the desert night, And knew he had no father. It may be I'm not as strong as other women are, Who, torn and crushed, are not undone from love: It may be I am colder than the dead, Who, being dead, love always. But for me, Once killed, this ghost of Marian loves no more, No more . . . except the child! . . . no more at all. I told your cousin, sir, that I was dead; And now, she thinks I'll get up from my grave, And wear my chin-cloth for a wedding-veil, And glide along the churchyard like a bride While all the dead keep whispering through the withes, ‘You would be better in your place with us, ‘You pitiful corruption!’ At the thought, The damps break out on me like leprosy Although I'm clean. Ay, clean as Marian Erle! As Marian Leigh, I know, I were not clean: Nor have I so much life that I should love, Except the child. Ah God! I could not bear To see my darling on a good man's knees, And know, by such a look, or such a sigh, Or such a silence, that he thought sometimes, ‘This child was fathered by some cursèd wretch’ . . . For, Romney, angels are less tender-wise Than God and mothers: even you would think What we think never. He is ours, the child; And we would sooner vex a soul in heaven By coupling with it the dead body's thought, It left behind it in a last month's grave, Than, in my child, see other than . . . my child. We only never call him fatherless Who has God and his mother. O my babe, My pretty, pretty blossom, an ill wind Once blew upon my breast! can any think I'd have another—one called happier, A fathered child, with father's love and race That's worn as bold and open as a smile, To vex my darling when he's asked his name And has no answer? What! a happier child Than mine, my best—who laughed so loud to-night He could not sleep for pastime? Nay, I swear, By life and love, that, if I lived like some, And loved like . . . some, ay, loved you, Romney Leigh, As some love (eyes that have wept so much, see clear), I've room for no more children in my arms, My kisses are all melted on one mouth, I would not push my darling to a stool To dandle babies. Here's a hand shall keep For ever clean without a marriage-ring, To tend my boy until he cease to need One steadying finger of it, and desert (Not miss) his mother's lap, to sit with men. And when I miss him (not he me), I'll come And say ‘Now give me some of Romney's work, To help your outcast orphans of the world And comfort grief with grief.’ For you, meantime, Most noble Romney, wed a noble wife, And open on each other your great souls— I need not farther bless you. If I dared But strain and touch her in her upper sphere, And say ‘Come down to Romney—pay my debt!’ I should be joyful with the stream of joy Sent through me. But the moon is in my face . . . I dare not—though I guess the name he loves; I'm learned with my studies of old days, Remembering how he crushed his under-lip When some one came and spoke, or did not come. Aurora, I could touch her with my hand, And fly because I dare not.” She was gone. He smiled so sternly that I spoke in haste. “Forgive her—she sees clearly for herself: Her instinct's holy.” “I forgive!” he said, “I only marvel how she sees so sure, While others” . . . there he paused—then hoarse, abrupt, “Aurora! you forgive us, her and me? For her, the thing she sees, poor, loyal child, If once corrected by the thing I know, Had been unspoken, since she loves you well, Has leave to love you:—while for me, alas! If once or twice I let my heart escape This night, . . . remember, where hearts slip and fall, They break beside: we're parting—parting—ah! You do not love, that you should surely know What that word means. Forgive, be tolerant: It had not been, but that I felt myself So safe in impuissance and despair, I could not hurt you though I tossed my arms And sighed my soul out. The most utter wretch Will choose his postures when he comes to die, However in the presence of a queen; And you'll forgive me some unseemly spasms Which meant no more than dying. Do you think I had ever come here in my perfect mind Unless I had come here in my settled mind Bound Marian's, bound to keep the bond and give My name, my house, my hand, the things I could, To Marian? For even I could give as much: Even I, affronting her exalted soul By a supposition that she wanted these, Could act the husband's coat and hat set up To creak i' the wind and drive the world-crows off From pecking in her garden. Straw can fill A hole to keep out vermin. Now, at last, I own heaven's angels round her life suffice To fight the rats of our society Without this Romney: I can see it at last; And here is ended my pretension which The most pretended. Over-proud of course, Even so!—but not so stupid . . . blind . . . that I, Whom thus the great Taskmaster of the world Has set to meditate mistaken work, My dreary face against a dim blank wall Throughout man's natural lifetime—could pretend Or wish . . . O love, I have loved you! O my soul, I have lost you!—but I swear by all yourself, And all you might have been to me these years, If that June morning had not failed my hope— I'm not so bestial, to regret that day— This night—this night, which still to you is fair! Nay, not so blind, Aurora. I attest Those stars above us which I cannot see”. . “You cannot” . . . “That if Heaven itself should stoop, Re-mix the lots, and give me another chance, I'd say ‘No other!’—I'd record my blank. Aurora never should be wife of mine.” “Not see the stars?” “'Tis worse still, not to see, To find your hand, although we're parting, dear. A moment let me hold it ere we part; And understand my last words—these, at last! I would not have you thinking when I'm gone That Romney dared to hanker for your love In thought or vision, if attainable (Which certainly for me it never was), And wished to use it for a dog to-day To help the blind man stumbling. God forbid! And now I know He held you in His palm, And kept you open-eyed to all my faults, To save you at last from such a dreary end. Believe me, dear, that, if I had known like Him What loss was coming on me, I had done As well in this as He has.—Farewell, you Who are still my light,—farewell! How late it is: I know that, now. You've been too patient, sweet. I will but blow my whistle toward the lane, And some one comes—the same who brought me here. Get in—Good-night.” “A moment. Heavenly Christ! A moment. Speak once, Romney. 'Tis not true. I hold your hands, I look into your face— You see me?” “No more than the blessèd stars. Be blessèd too, Aurora. Nay, my sweet, You tremble. Tender-hearted! Do you mind Of yore, dear, how you used to cheat old John, And let the mice out slyly from his traps, Until he marvelled at the soul in mice Which took the cheese and left the snare? The same Dear soft heart always! 'Twas for this I grieved Howe's letter never reached you. Ah, you had heard Of illness—not the issue, not the extent: My life, long sick with tossings up and down, The sudden revulsion in the blazing house, The strain and struggle both of body and soul, Which left fire running in my veins for blood, Scarce lacked that thunderbolt of the falling beam Which nicked me on the forehead as I passed The gallery-door with a burden. Say heaven's bolt, Not William Erle's, not Marian's father's,—tramp And poacher, whom I found for what he was, And, eager for her sake to rescue him, Forth swept from the open highway of the world, Road-dust and all—till, like a woodland boar Most naturally unwilling to be tamed, He notched me with his tooth. But not a word To Marian! and I do not think, besides, He turned the tilting of the beam my way; And if he laughed, as many swear, poor wretch, Nor he, nor I supposed the hurt so deep. We'll hope his next laugh may be merrier, In a better cause.” “Blind, Romney?” “Ah, my friend, You'll learn to say it in a cheerful voice; I, too, at first desponded. To be blind, Turned out of nature, mulcted as a man, Refused the daily largesse of the sun To humble creatures! When the fever's heat Dropped from me, as the flame did from my house, And left me ruined like it, stripped of all The hues and shapes of aspectable life, A mere bare blind stone in the blaze of day, A man, upon the outside of the earth, As dark as ten feet under, in the grave,— Why, that seemed hard.” “No hope?” “A tear! you weep, Divine Aurora? tears upon my hand! I've seen you weeping for a mouse, a bird,— But, weep for me, Aurora? Yes, there's hope. Not hope of sight,—I could be learned, dear, And tell you in what Greek and Latin name The visual nerve is withered to the root, Though the outer eyes appear indifferent, Unspotted in their crystals. But there's hope. The spirit, from behind this dethroned sense, Sees, waits in patience till the walls break up From which the bas-relief and fresco have dropped: There's hope. The man here, once so arrogant And restless, so ambitious, for his part, Of dealing with statistically packed Disorders (from a pattern on his nail), And packing such things quite another way,— Is now contented. From his personal loss He has come to hope for others when they lose, And wear a gladder faith in what we gain . . . Through bitter experience, compensation sweet, Like that tear, sweetest. I am quiet now, As tender surely for the suffering world, But quiet,—sitting at the wall to learn, Content henceforth to do the thing I can: For, though as powerless, said I, as a stone, A stone can still give shelter to a worm, And it is worth while being a stone for that: There's hope, Aurora.” “Is there hope for me? For me?—and is there room beneath the stone For such a worm?—And if I came and said . . . What all this weeping scarce will let me say, And yet what women cannot say at all But weeping bitterly . . . (the pride keeps up, Until the heart breaks under it) . . . I love,— I love you, Romney” . . . “Silence!” he exclaimed. “A woman's pity sometimes makes her mad. A man's distraction must not cheat his soul To take advantage of it. Yet, 'tis hard Farewell, Aurora.” “But I love you, sir; And when a woman says she loves a man, The man must hear her, though he love her not, Which . . . hush! . . . he has leave to answer in his turn; She will not surely blame him. As for me, You call it pity,—think I'm generous? 'Twere somewhat easier, for a woman proud As I am, and I'm very vilely proud, To let it pass as such, and press on you Love born of pity,—seeing that excellent loves Are born so, often, nor the quicklier die,— And this would set me higher by the head Than now I stand. No matter: let the truth Stand high; Aurora must be humble: no, My love's not pity merely. Obviously I'm not a generous woman, never was, Or else, of old, I had not looked so near To weights and measures, grudging you the power To give, as first I scorned your power to judge For me, Aurora. I would have no gifts, Forsooth, but God's,—and I would use them too According to my pleasure and my choice, As He and I were equals, you below, Excluded from that level of interchange Admitting benefaction. You were wrong In much? you said so. I was wrong in most. Oh, most! You only thought to rescue men By half-means, half-way, seeing half their wants, While thinking nothing of your personal gain. But I, who saw the human nature broad At both sides, comprehending too the soul's, And all the high necessities of Art, Betrayed the thing I saw, and wronged my own life For which I pleaded. Passioned to exalt The artist's instinct in me at the cost Of putting down the woman's, I forgot No perfect artist is developed here From any imperfect woman. Flower from root, And spiritual from natural, grade by grade In all our life. A handful of the earth To make God's image! the despised poor earth, The healthy, odorous earth,—I missed with it The divine Breath that blows the nostrils out To ineffable inflatus,—ay, the breath Which love is. Art is much, but Love is more. O Art, my Art, thou'rt much, but Love is more! Art symbolises heaven, but Love is God And makes heaven. I, Aurora, fell from mine. I would not be a woman like the rest, A simple woman who believes in love And owns the right of love because she loves, And, hearing she's beloved, is satisfied With what contents God: I must analyse, Confront, and question; just as if a fly Refused to warm itself in any sun Till such was in Leone: I must fret, Forsooth, because the month was only May, Be faithless of the kind of proffered love, And captious, lest it miss my dignity, And scornful, that my lover sought a wife To use . . . to use! O Romney, O my love, I am changed since then, changed wholly,—for indeed If now you'd stoop so low to take my love And use it roughly, without stint or spare, As men use common things with more behind (And, in this, ever would be more behind) To any mean and ordinary end,— The joy would set me like a star, in heaven, So high up, I should shine because of height And not of virtue. Yet in one respect, Just one, beloved, I am in nowise changed: I love you, loved you . . . loved you first and last, And love you on for ever. Now I know I loved you always, Romney. She who died Knew that, and said so; Lady Waldemar Knows that; . . . and Marian. I had known the same, Except that I was prouder than I knew, And not so honest. Ay, and, as I live, I should have died so, crushing in my hand This rose of love, the wasp inside and all, Ignoring ever to my soul and you Both rose and pain—except for this great loss, This great despair—to stand before your face And know you do not see me where I stand. You think, perhaps, I am not changed from pride And that I chiefly bear to say such words, Because you cannot shame me with your eyes? O calm, grand eyes, extinguished in a storm, Blown out like lights o'er melancholy seas, Though shrieked for by the shipwrecked,—O my Dark, My Cloud,—to go before me every day While I go ever toward the wilderness,— I would that you could see me bare to the soul! If this be pity, 'tis so for myself, And not for Romney! he can stand alone; A man like him is never overcome: No woman like me counts him pitiable While saints applaud him. He mistook the world; But I mistook my own heart, and that slip Was fatal. Romney,—will you leave me here? So wrong, so proud, so weak, so unconsoled, So mere a woman!—and I love you so, I love you, Romney—” Could I see his face, I wept so? Did I drop against his breast, Or did his arms constrain me? were my cheeks Hot, overflooded, with my tears—or his? And which of our two large explosive hearts So shook me? That, I know not. There were words That broke in utterance . . . melted, in the fire,— Embrace, that was convulsion, . . . then a kiss As long and silent as the ecstatic night, And deep, deep, shuddering breaths, which meant beyond Whatever could be told by word or kiss. But what he said . . . I have written day by day, With somewhat even writing. Did I think That such a passionate rain would intercept And dash this last page? What he said, indeed, I fain would write it down here like the rest, To keep it in my eyes, as in my ears, The heart's sweet scripture, to be read at night When weary, or at morning when afraid, And lean my heaviest oath on when I swear That, when all's done, all tried, all counted here, All great arts, and all good philosophies, This love just puts its hand out in a dream And straight outstretches all things. What he said, I fain would write. But if an angel spoke In thunder, should we haply know much more Than that it thundered? If a cloud came down And wrapped us wholly, could we draw its shape, As if on the outside and not overcome? And so he spake. His breath against my face Confused his words, yet made them more intense (As when the sudden finger of the wind Will wipe a row of single city-lamps To a pure white line of flame, more luminous Because of obliteration), more intense, The intimate presence carrying in itself Complete communication, as with souls Who, having put the body off, perceive Through simply being. Thus, 'twas granted me To know he loved me to the depth and height Of such large natures, ever competent, With grand horizons by the sea or land, To love's grand sunrise. Small spheres hold small fires, But he loved largely, as a man can love Who, baffled in his love, dares live his life, Accept the ends which God loves, for his own, And lift a constant aspect. From the day I brought to England my poor searching face (An orphan even of my father's grave), He had loved me, watched me, watched his soul in mine, Which in me grew and heightened into love. For he, a boy still, had been told the tale Of how a fairy bride from Italy With smells of oleanders in her hair, Was coming through the vines to touch his hand; Whereat the blood of boyhood on the palm Made sudden heats. And when at last I came, And lived before him—lived, and rarely smiled— He smiled and loved me for the thing I was, As every child will love the year's first flower (Not certainly the fairest of the year, But, in which, the complete year seems to blow), The poor sad snowdrop,—growing between drifts, Mysterious medium 'twixt the plant and frost, So faint with winter while so quick with spring, And doubtful if to thaw itself away With that snow near it. Not that Romney Leigh Had loved me coldly. If I thought so once, It was as if I had held my hand in fire And shook for cold. But now I understood, For ever, that the very fire and heat Of troubling passion in him burned him clear, And shaped, to dubious order, word and act: That, just because he loved me over all, All wealth, all lands, all social privilege, To which chance made him unexpected heir, And, just because on all these lesser gifts, Constrained by conscience and the sense of wrong, He had stamped with steady hand God's arrow-mark Of dedication to the human need, He thought it should be so too, with his love. He, passionately loving, would bring down His love, his life, his best (because the best), His bride of dreams, who walked so still and high Through flowery poems as through meadow-grass, The dust of golden lilies on her feet, That she should walk beside him on the rocks In all that clang and hewing out of men, And help the work of help which was his life, And prove he kept back nothing,—not his soul. And when I failed him,—for I failed him, I, And when it seemed he had missed my love, he thought “Aurora makes room for a working-noon,” And so, self-girded with torn strips of hope, Took up his life as if it were for death (Just capable of one heroic aim), And threw it in the thickest of the world,— At which men laughed as if he had drowned a dog. No wonder,—since Aurora failed him first! The morning and the evening made his day. But oh, the night! oh, bitter-sweet! oh, sweet! O dark, O moon and stars, O ecstasy Of darkness! O great mystery of love, In which absorbed, loss, anguish, treason's self Enlarges rapture,—as a pebble dropped In some full wine-cup overbrims the wine! While we two sat together, leaned that night So close my very garments crept and thrilled With strange electric life, and both my cheeks Grew red, then pale, with touches from my hair In which his breath was,—while the golden moon Was hung before our faces as the badge Of some sublime inherited despair, Since ever to be seen by only one,— A voice said, low and rapid as a sigh, Yet breaking, I felt conscious, from a smile, “Thank God, who made me blind, to make me see! Shine on, Aurora, dearest light of souls, Which rul'st for evermore both day and night! I am happy.” I flung closer to his breast, As sword that, after battle, flings to sheath; And, in that hurtle of united souls, The mystic motions which in common moods Are shut beyond our sense, broke in on us, And, as we sat, we felt the old earth spin, And all the starry turbulence of worlds Swing round us in their audient circles, till, If that same golden moon were overhead Or if beneath our feet, we did not know. And then calm, equal, smooth with weights of joy, His voice rose, as some chief musician's song Amid the old Jewish temple's Selah-pause, And bade me mark how we two met at last Upon this moon-bathed promontory of earth, To give up much on each side, then take all. “Beloved,” it sang, “we must be here to work; And men who work can only work for men, And, not to work in vain, must comprehend Humanity and so work humanly, And raise men's bodies still by raising souls, As God did first.” “But stand upon the earth,” I said, “to raise them (this is human too, There's nothing high which has not first been low; My humbleness, said One, has made me great!) As God did last.” “And work all silently And simply,” he returned, “as God does all; Distort our nature never for our work, Nor count our right hands stronger for being hoofs. The man most man, with tenderest human hands, Works best for men,—as God in Nazareth.” He paused upon the word, and then resumed: “Fewer programmes, we who have no pre-science. Fewer systems, we who are held and do not hold. Less mapping out of masses to be saved, By nations or by sexes. Fourier's void, And Comte absurd,—and Cabet puerile. Subsist no rules of life outside of life, No perfect manners without Christian souls: The Christ Himself had been no Lawgiver Unless He had given the life, too, with the law.” I echoed thoughtfully: “The man, most man, Works best for men, and, if most man indeed, He gets his manhood plainest from his soul: While obviously this stringent soul itself Obeys the old law of development, The Spirit ever witnessing in ours, And Love, the soul of soul, within the soul, Evolving it sublimely. First, God's love.” “And next,” he smiled, “the love of wedded souls, Which still presents that mystery's counterpart. Sweet shadow-rose, upon the water of life, Of such a mystic substance, Sharon gave A name to! human, vital, fructuous rose, Whose calyx holds the multitude of leaves, Loves filial, loves fraternal, neighbour-loves And civic—all fair petals, all good scents, All reddened, sweetened from one central Heart!” “Alas,” I cried, “it was not long ago You swore this very social rose smelt ill.” “Alas,” he answered, “is it a rose at all? The filial's thankless, the fraternal's hard, The rest is lost. I do but stand and think, Across the waters of a troubled life This Flower of Heaven so vainly overhangs, What perfect counterpart would be in sight If tanks were clearer. Let us clean the tubes, And wait for rains. O poet, O my love, Since I was too ambitious in my deed, And thought to distance all men in success (Till God came on me, marked the place, and said ‘Ill-doer, henceforth keep within this line, Attempting less than others,’—and I stand And work among Christ's little ones, content), Come thou, my compensation, my dear sight, My morning-star, my morning,—rise and shine, And touch my hills with radiance not their own. Shine out for two, Aurora, and fulfil My falling-short that must be! work for two, As I, though thus restrained, for two, shall love! Gaze on, with inscient vision toward the sun, And, from his visceral heat, pluck out the roots Of light beyond him. Art's a service,—mark: A silver key is given to thy clasp, And thou shalt stand unwearied, night and day, And fix it in the hard, slow-turning wards, To open, so, that intermediate door Betwixt the different planes of sensuous form And form insensuous, that inferior men May learn to feel on still through these to those, And bless thy ministration. The world waits For help. Beloved, let us love so well, Our work shall still be better for our love, And still our love be sweeter for our work, And both commended, for the sake of each, By all true workers and true lovers born. Now press the clarion on thy woman's lip (Love's holy kiss shall still keep consecrate) And breathe thy fine keen breath along the brass, And blow all class-walls level as Jericho's Past Jordan,—crying from the top of souls, To souls, that, here assembled on earth's flats, They get them to some purer eminence Than any hitherto beheld for clouds! What height we know not,—but the way we know, And how by mounting ever we attain, And so climb on. It is the hour for souls, That bodies, leavened by the will and love, Be lightened to redemption. The world's old, But the old world waits the time to be renewed, Toward which, new hearts in individual growth Must quicken, and increase to multitude In new dynasties of the race of men; Developed whence, shall grow spontaneously New churches, new œconomies, new laws Admitting freedom, new societies Excluding falsehood: He shall make all new.” My Romney!—Lifting up my hand in his, As wheeled by Seeing spirits toward the east, He turned instinctively, where, faint and far, Along the tingling desert of the sky, Beyond the circle of the conscious hills, Were laid in jasper-stone as clear as glass The first foundations of that new, near Day Which should be builded out of heaven to God. He stood a moment with erected brows, In silence, as a creature might who gazed,— Stood calm, and fed his blind, majestic eyes Upon the thought of perfect noon: and when I saw his soul saw,—“Jasper first,” I said; “And second, sapphire; third, chalcedony; The rest in order:—last, an amethyst.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS BEFORE CONGRESS. 1860. NAPOLEON III. IN ITALY. I. Emperor, Emperor! From the centre to the shore, From the Seine back to the Rhine, Stood eight millions up and swore By their manhood's right divine So to elect and legislate, This man should renew the line Broken in a strain of fate And leagued kings at Waterloo, When the people's hands let go. Emperor Evermore. II. With a universal shout They took the old regalia out From an open grave that day; From a grave that would not close, Where the first Napoleon lay Expectant, in repose, As still as Merlin, with his conquering face Turned up in its unquenchable appeal To men and heroes of the advancing race,— Prepared to set the seal Of what has been on what shall be. Emperor Evermore. III. The thinkers stood aside To let the nation act. Some hated the new-constituted fact Of empire, as pride treading on their pride. Some quailed, lest what was poisonous in the past Should graft itself in that Druidic bough On this green Now. Some cursed, because at last The open heavens to which they had looked in vain For many a golden fall of marvellous rain Were closed in brass; and some Wept on because a gone thing could not come; And some were silent, doubting all things for That popular conviction,—evermore Emperor. IV. That day I did not hate Nor doubt, nor quail nor curse. I, reverencing the people, did not bate My reverence of their deed and oracle, Nor vainly prate Of better and of worse Against the great conclusion of their will. And yet, O voice and verse, Which God set in me to acclaim and sing Conviction, exaltation, aspiration, We gave no music to the patent thing, Nor spared a holy rhythm to throb and swim About the name of him Translated to the sphere of domination By democratic passion! I was not used, at least, Nor can be, now or then, To stroke the ermine beast On any kind of throne (Though builded by a nation for its own), And swell the surging choir for kings of men— “Emperor Evermore.” V. But now, Napoleon, now That, leaving far behind the purple throng Of vulgar monarchs, thou Tread'st higher in thy deed Than stair of throne can lead, To help in the hour of wrong The broken hearts of nations to be strong,— Now, lifted as thou art To the level of pure song, We stand to meet thee on these Alpine snows! And while the palpitating peaks break out Ecstatic from somnambular repose With answers to the presence and the shout, We, poets of the people, who take part With elemental justice, natural right, Join in our echoes also, nor refrain. We meet thee, O Napoleon, at this height At last, and find thee great enough to praise. Receive the poet's chrism, which smells beyond The priest's, and pass thy ways;— An English poet warns thee to maintain God's word, not England's:—let His truth be true And all men liars! with His truth respond To all men's lie. Exalt the sword and smite On that long anvil of the Apennine Where Austria forged the Italian chain in view Of seven consenting nations, sparks of fine Admonitory light, Till men's eyes wink before convictions new. Flash in God's justice to the world's amaze, Sublime Deliverer!—after many days Found worthy of the deed thou art come to do— Emperor Evermore. VI. But Italy, my Italy, Can it last, this gleam? Can she live and be strong, Or is it another dream Like the rest we have dreamed so long? And shall it, must it be, That after the battle-cloud has broken She will die off again Like the rain, Or like a poet's song Sung of her, sad at the end Because her name is Italy,— Die and count no friend? Is it true,—may it be spoken,— That she who has lain so still, With a wound in her breast, And a flower in her hand, And a grave-stone under her head, While every nation at will Beside her has dared to stand, And flout her with pity and scorn, Saying “She is at rest, She is fair, she is dead, And, leaving room in her stead To Us who are later born, This is certainly best!” Saying “Alas, she is fair, Very fair, but dead,—give place, And so we have room for the race.” —Can it be true, be true, That she lives anew? That she rises up at the shout of her sons, At the trumpet of France, And lives anew?—is it true That she has not moved in a trance, As in Forty-eight? When her eyes were troubled with blood Till she knew not friend from foe, Till her hand was caught in a strait Of her cerement and baffled so From doing the deed she would; And her weak foot stumbled across The grave of a king, And down she dropt at heavy loss, And we gloomily covered her face and said, “We have dreamed the thing; She is not alive, but dead.” VII. Now, shall we say Our Italy lives indeed? And if it were not for the beat and bray Of drum and trump of martial men, Should we feel the underground heave and strain, Where heroes left their dust as a seed Sure to emerge one day? And if it were not for the rhythmic march Of France and Piedmont's double hosts, Should we hear the ghosts Thrill through ruined aisle and arch, Throb along the frescoed wall, Whisper an oath by that divine They left in picture, book, and stone, That Italy is not dead at all? Ay, if it were not for the tears in our eyes, These tears of a sudden passionate joy, Should we see her arise From the place where the wicked are over-thrown, Italy, Italy—loosed at length From the tyrant's thrall, Pale and calm in her strength? Pale as the silver cross of Savoy When the hand that bears the flag is brave, And not a breath is stirring, save What is blown Over the war-trump's lip of brass, Ere Garibaldi forces the pass! VIII. Ay, it is so, even so. Ay, and it shall be so. Each broken stone that long ago She flung behind her as she went In discouragement and bewilderment Through the cairns of Time, and missed her way Between to-day and yesterday, Up springs a living man. And each man stands with his face in the light Of his own drawn sword, Ready to do what a hero can. Wall to sap, or river to ford, Cannon to front, or foe to pursue, Still ready to do, and sworn to be true, As a man and a patriot can. Piedmontese, Neapolitan, Lombard, Tuscan, Romagnole, Each man's body having a soul,— Count how many they stand, All of them sons of the land, Every live man there Allied to a dead man below, And the deadest with blood to spare To quicken a living hand In case it should ever be slow. Count how many they come To the beat of Piedmont's drum, With faces keener and grayer Than swords of the Austrian slayer, All set against the foe. “Emperor Evermore.” IX. Out of the dust where they ground them; Out of the holes where they dogged them; Out of the hulks where they wound them In iron, tortured and flogged them; Out of the streets where they chased them, Taxed them, and then bayonetted them; Out of the homes where they spied on them (Using their daughters and wives); Out of the church where they fretted them, Rotted their souls and debased them, Trained them to answer with knives, Then cursed them all at their prayers!— Out of cold lands, not theirs, Where they exiled them, starved them, lied on them; Back they come like a wind, in vain Cramped up in the hills, that roars its road The stronger into the open plain, Or like a fire that burns the hotter And longer for the crust of cinder, Serving better the ends of the potter; Or like a restrainèd word of God, Fulfilling itself by what seems to hinder. “Emperor Evermore.” X. Shout for France and Savoy! Shout for the helper and doer. Shout for the good sword's ring, Shout for the thought still truer. Shout for the spirits at large Who passed for the dead this spring, Whose living glory is sure. Shout for France and Savoy! Shout for the council and charge! Shout for the head of Cavour; And shout for the heart of a King That's great with a nation's joy! Shout for France and Savoy! XI. Take up the child, Macmahon, though Thy hand be red From Magenta's dead, And riding on, in front of the troop, In the dust of the whirlwind of war Through the gate of the city of Milan, stoop And take up the child to thy saddle-bow, Nor fear the touch as soft as a flower of his smile as clear as a star! Thou hast a right to the child, we say, Since the women are weeping for joy as they Who, by thy help and from this day, Shall be happy mothers indeed. They are raining flowers from terrace and roof: Take up the flower in the child. While the shout goes up of a nation freed And heroically self-reconciled, Till the snow on that peaked Alp aloof Starts, as feeling God's finger anew, And all those cold white marble fires Of mounting saints on the Duomo-spires Flicker against the Blue. “Emperor Evermore.” XII. Ay, it is He, Who rides at the King's right hand! Leave room to his horse and draw to the side, Nor press too near in the ecstasy Of a newly delivered impassioned land: He is moved, you see, He who has done it all. They call it a cold stern face; But this is Italy Who rises up to her place!— For this he fought in his youth, Of this he dreamed in the past; The lines of the resolute mouth Tremble a little at last. Cry, he has done it all! “Emperor Evermore.” XIII. It is not strange that he did it, Though the deed may seem to strain To the wonderful, unpermitted, For such as lead and reign. But he is strange, this man: The people's instinct found him (A wind in the dark that ran Through a chink where was no door), And elected him and crowned him Emperor Evermore. XIV. Autocrat? let them scoff, Who fail to comprehend That a ruler incarnate of The people must transcend All common king-born kings; These subterranean springs A sudden outlet winning Have special virtues to spend. The people's blood runs through him, Dilates from head to foot, Creates him absolute, And from this great beginning Evokes a greater end To justify and renew him— Emperor Evermore. XV. What! did any maintain That God or the people (think!) Could make a marvel in vain?— Out of the water-jar there, Draw wine that none could drink? Is this a man like the rest, This miracle, made unaware By a rapture of popular air, And caught to the place that was best? You think he could barter and cheat As vulgar diplomates use, With the people's heart in his breast? Prate a lie into shape Lest truth should cumber the road; Play at the fast and loose Till the world is strangled with tape; Maim the soul's complete To fit the hole of a toad; And filch the dogman's meat To feed the offspring of God? XVI. Nay, but he, this wonder, He cannot palter nor prate, Though many around him and under, With intellects trained to the curve, Distrust him in spirit and nerve Because his meaning is straight. Measure him ere he depart With those who have governed and led: Larger so much by the heart, Larger so much by the head. Emperor Evermore. XVII. He holds that, consenting or dissident, Nations must move with the time; Assumes that crime with a precedent Doubles the guilt of the crime; —Denies that a slaver's bond, Or a treaty signed by knaves (Quorum magna pars and beyond Was one of an honest name) Gives an inexpugnable claim To abolish men into slaves. Emperor Evermore. XVIII. He will not swagger nor boast Of his country's meeds, in a tone Missuiting a great man most If such should speak of his own; Nor will he act, on her side, From motives baser, indeed, Than a man of a noble pride Can avow for himself at need; Never, for lucre or laurels, Or custom, though such should be rife, Adapting the smaller morals To measure the larger life. He, though the merchants persuade, And the soldiers are eager for strife, Finds not his country in quarrels Only to find her in trade,— While still he accords her such honour As never to flinch for her sake Where men put service upon her, Found heavy to undertake And scarcely like to be paid: Believing a nation may act Unselfishly—shiver a lance (As the least of her sons may, in fact) And not for a cause of finance. Emperor Evermore. XIX. Great is he Who uses his greatness for all. His name shall stand perpetually As a name to applaud and cherish, Not only within the civic wall For the loyal, but also without For the generous and free. Just is he, Who is just for the popular due As well as the private debt. The praise of nations ready to perish Fall on him,—crown him in view Of tyrants caught in the net, And statesmen dizzy with fear and doubt! And though, because they are many, And he is merely one, And nations selfish and cruel Heap up the inquisitor's fuel To kill the body of high intents, And burn great deeds from their place, Till this, the greatest of any, May seem imperfectly done; Courage, whoever circumvents! Courage, courage, whoever is base! The soul of a high intent, be it known, Can die no more than any soul Which God keeps by Him under the throne; And this, at whatever interim, Shall live, and be consummated Into the being of deeds made whole. Courage, courage! happy is he, Of whom (himself among the dead And silent) this word shall be said: —That he might have had the world with him, But chose to side with suffering men, And had the world against him when He came to deliver Italy. Emperor Evermore. THE DANCE. I You remember down at Florence our Cascine, Where the people on the feast-days walk and drive, And, through the trees, long-drawn in many a green way, O'er-roofing hum and murmur like a hive, The river and the mountains look alive? II You remember the piazzone there, the stand-place Of carriages a-brim with Florence Beauties, Who lean and melt to music as the band plays, Or smile and chat with some one who afoot is, Or on horseback, in observance of male duties? III 'Tis so pretty, in the afternoons of summer, So many gracious faces brought together! Call it rout, or call it concert, they have come here, In the floating of the fan and of the feather, To reciprocate with beauty the fine weather. IV While the flower-girls offer nosegays (because they too Go with other sweets) at every carriage-door; Here, by shake of a white finger, signed away to Some next buyer, who sits buying score on score, Piling roses upon roses evermore. V And last season, when the French camp had its station In the meadow-ground, things quickened and grew gayer Through the mingling of the liberating nation With this people; groups of Frenchmen everywhere, Strolling, gazing, judging lightly—“who was fair.” VI Then the noblest lady present took upon her To speak nobly from her carriage for the rest: “Pray these officers from France to do us honour By dancing with us straightway.” The request Was gravely apprehended as addressed. VII And the men of France, bareheaded, bowing lowly, Led out each a proud signora to the space Which the startled crowd had rounded for them—slowly, Just a touch of still emotion in his face, Not presuming, through the symbol, on the grace. VIII There was silence in the people: some lips trembled, But none jested. Broke the music, at a glance: And the daughters of our princes, thus assembled, Stepped the measure with the gallant sons of France, Hush! it might have been a Mass, and not a dance. IX And they danced there till the blue that over-skied us Swooned with passion, though the footing seemed sedate; And the mountains, heaving mighty hearts beside us, Sighed a rapture in a shadow, to dilate, And touch the holy stone where Dante sate. X Then the sons of France, bareheaded, lowly bowing, Led the ladies back where kinsmen of the south Stood, received them; till, with burst of overflowing Feeling—husbands, brothers, Florence's male youth, Turned, and kissed the martial strangers mouth to mouth. XI And a cry went up, a cry from all that people! —You have heard a people cheering, you suppose, For the Member, mayor . . . with chorus from the steeple? This was different: scarce as loud, perhaps (who knows?), For we saw wet eyes around us ere the close. XII And we felt as if a nation, too long borne in By hard wrongers,—comprehending in such attitude That God had spoken somewhere since the morning, That men were somehow brothers, by no platitude,— Cried exultant in great wonder and free gratitude. A TALE OF VILLAFRANCA. TOLD IN TUSCANY. I My little son, my Florentine, Sit down beside my knee, And I will tell you why the sign Of joy which flushed our Italy Has faded since but yesternight; And why your Florence of delight Is mourning as you see. II A great man (who was crowned one day) Imagined a great Deed: He shaped it out of cloud and clay, He touched it finely till the seed Possessed the flower: from heart and brain He fed it with large thoughts humane, To help a people's need. III He brought it out into the sun— They blessed it to his face: “O great pure Deed, that hast undone So many bad and base! O generous Deed, heroic Deed, Come forth, be perfected, succeed, Deliver by God's grace.” IV Then sovereigns, statesmen, north and south, Rose up in wrath and fear, And cried, protesting by one mouth, “What monster have we here? A great Deed at this hour of day? A great just Deed—and not for pay? Absurd,—or insincere.” V “And if sincere, the heavier blow In that case we shall bear, For where's our blessed ‘status quo,’ Our holy treaties, where,— Our rights to sell a race, or buy, Protect and pillage, occupy, And civilise despair?” VI Some muttered that the great Deed meant A great pretext to sin; And others, the pretext, so lent, Was heinous (to begin). Volcanic terms of “great” and “just”? Admit such tongues of flame, the crust Of time and law falls in. VII A great Deed in this world of ours? Unheard of the pretence is: It threatens plainly the great Powers; Is fatal in all senses. A just Deed in the world?—call out The rifles! be not slack about The national defences. VIII And many murmured, “From this source What red blood must be poured!” And some rejoined, “'Tis even worse; What red tape is ignored!” All cursed the Doer for an evil Called here, enlarging on the Devil,— There, monkeying the Lord! IX Some said it could not be explained, Some, could not be excused; And others, “Leave it unrestrained, Gehenna's self is loosed.” And all cried “Crush it, maim it, gag it! Set dog-toothed lies to tear it ragged, Truncated and traduced!” X But He stood sad before the sun (The peoples felt their fate). “The world is many,—I am one; My great Deed was too great. God's fruit of justice ripens slow: Men's souls are narrow; let them grow. My brothers, we must wait.” XI The tale is ended, child of mine, Turned graver at my knee. They say your eyes, my Florentine, Are English: it may be. And yet I've marked as blue a pair Following the doves across the square At Venice by the sea. XII Ah child! ah child! I cannot say A word more. You conceive The reason now, why just to-day We see our Florence grieve. Ah child, look up into the sky! In this low world, where great Deeds die, What matter if we live? A COURT LADY. I Her hair was tawny with gold, her eyes with purple were dark, Her cheeks' pale opal burnt with a red and restless spark. II Never was lady of Milan nobler in name and in race; Never was lady of Italy fairer to see in the face. III Never was lady on earth more true as woman and wife, Larger in judgment and instinct, prouder in manners and life. IV She stood in the early morning, and said to her maidens “Bring That silken robe made ready to wear at the Court of the King. V “Bring me the clasps of diamond, lucid, clear of the mote, Clasp me the large at the waist, and clasp me the small at the throat. VI “Diamonds to fasten the hair, and diamonds to fasten the sleeves, Laces to drop from their rays, like a powder of snow from the eaves.” VII Gorgeous she entered the sunlight which gathered her up in a flame, While, straight in her open carriage, she to the hospital came. VIII In she went at the door, and gazing from end to end, “Many and low are the pallets, but each is the place of a friend.” IX Up she passed through the wards, and stood at a young man's bed: Bloody the band on his brow, and livid the droop of his head. X “Art thou a Lombard, my brother? Happy art thou,” she cried, And smiled like Italy on him: he dreamed in her face and died. XI Pale with his passing soul, she went on still to a second: He was a grave hard man, whose years by dungeons were reckoned. XII Wounds in his body were sore, wounds in his life were sorer. “Art thou a Romagnole?” Her eyes drove lightnings before her. XIII “Austrian and priest had joined to double and tighten the cord Able to bind thee, O strong one,—free by the stroke of a sword. XIV “Now be grave for the rest of us, using the life overcast To ripen our wine of the present (too new) in glooms of the past.” XV Down she stepped to a pallet where lay a face like a girl's, Young, and pathetic with dying,—a deep black hole in the curls. XVI “Art thou from Tuscany, brother? and seest thou, dreaming in pain, Thy mother stand in the piazza, searching the List of the slain?” XVII Kind as a mother herself, she touched his cheeks with her hands: “Blessed is she who has borne thee, although she should weep as she stands.” XVIII On she passed to a Frenchman, his arm carried off by a ball: Kneeling,—“O more than my brother! how shall I thank thee for all? XIX “Each of the heroes around us has fought for his land and line, But thou hast fought for a stranger, in hate of a wrong not thine. XX “Happy are all free peoples, too strong to be dispossessed. But blessed are those among nations who dare to be strong for the rest!” XXI Ever she passed on her way, and came to a couch where pined One with a face from Venetia, white with a hope out of mind. XXII Long she stood and gazed, and twice she tried at the name, But two great crystal tears were all that faltered and came. XXIII Only a tear for Venice?—she turned as in passion and loss, And stooped to his forehead and kissed it, as if she were kissing the cross. XXIV Faint with that strain of heart she moved on then to another, Stern and strong in his death. “And dost thou suffer, my brother?” XXV Holding his hands in hers:—“Out of the Piedmont lion Cometh the sweetness of freedom! sweetest to live or to die on.” XXVI Holding his cold rough hands,—“Well, oh well have ye done In noble, noble Piedmont, who would not be noble alone.” XXVII Back he fell while she spoke. She rose to her feet with a spring,— “That was a Piedmontese! and this is the Court of the King.” AN AUGUST VOICE. “Una voce augusta.” —Monitore Toscano. I You'll take back your Grand-duke? I made the treaty upon it. Just venture a quiet rebuke; Dall' Ongaro write him a sonnet; Ricasoli gently explain Some need of the constitution: He'll swear to it over again, Providing an “easy solution.” You'll call back the Grand-duke. II You'll take back your Grand-duke? I promised the Emperor Francis To argue the case by his book, And ask you to meet his advances. The Ducal cause, we know (Whether you or he be the wronger), Has very strong points;—although Your bayonets, there, have stronger. You'll call back the Grand-duke. III You'll take back your Grand-duke? He is not pure altogether. For instance, the oath which he took (In the Forty-eight rough weather) He'd “nail your flag to his mast,” Then softly scuttled the boat you Hoped to escape in at last, And both by a “Proprio motu.” You'll call back the Grand-duke. IV You'll take back your Grand-duke? The scheme meets nothing to shock it In this smart letter, look, We found in Radetsky's pocket; Where his Highness in sprightly style Of the flower of his Tuscans wrote, “These heads be the hottest in file; Pray shoot them the quickest.” Quote, And call back the Grand-duke. V You'll take back your Grand-duke? There are some things to object to. He cheated, betrayed, and forsook, Then called in the foe to protect you. He taxed you for wines and for meats Throughout that eight years' pastime Of Austria's drum in your streets— Of course you remember the last time You called back your Grand-duke? VI You'll take back the Grand-duke? It is not race he is poor in, Although he never could brook The patriot cousin at Turin. His love of kin you discern, By his hate of your flag and me— So decidedly apt to turn All colours at the sight of the Three. The Italian tricolor: red, green, and white. You'll call back the Grand-duke. VII You'll take back your Grand-duke? 'Twas weak that he fled from the Pitti; But consider how little he shook At thought of bombarding your city! And, balancing that with this, The Christian rule is plain for us; . . . Or the Holy Father's Swiss Have shot his Perugians in vain for us. You'll call back the Grand-duke. VIII Pray take back your Grand-duke. —I, too, have suffered persuasion. All Europe, raven and rook, Screeched at me armed for your nation. Your cause in my heart struck spurs; I swept such warnings aside for you: My very child's eyes, and Hers, Grew like my brother's who died for you. You'll call back the Grand-duke? IX You'll take back your Grand-duke? My French fought nobly with reason,— Left many a Lombardy nook Red as with wine out of season. Little we grudged what was done there, Paid freely your ransom of blood: Our heroes stark in the sun there We would not recall if we could. You'll call back the Grand-duke? X You'll take back your Grand-duke? His son rode fast as he got off That day on the enemy's hook, When I had an epaulette shot off. Though splashed (as I saw him afar—no, Near) by those ghastly rains, The mark, when you've washed him in Arno, Will scarcely be larger than Cain's. You'll call back the Grand-duke? XI You'll take back your Grand-duke? 'Twill be so simple, quite beautiful: The shepherd recovers his crook, . . . If you should be sheep, and dutiful. I spoke a word worth chalking On Milan's wall—but stay, Here's Poniatowsky talking,— You'll listen to him to-day, And call back the Grand-duke. XII You'll take back your Grand-duke? Observe, there's no one to force it,— Unless the Madonna, Saint Luke Drew for you, choose to endorse it. I charge you, by great Saint Martino And prodigies quickened by wrong, Remember your Dead on Ticino; Be worthy, be constant, be strong— Bah!—call back the Grand-duke!! CHRISTMAS GIFTS. “?? ???????, ?? ???, ?? ?????.” —Gregory Nazianzen. I The Pope on Christmas Day Sits in Saint Peter's chair; But the peoples murmur and say “Our souls are sick and forlorn, And who will show us where Is the stable where Christ was born?” II The star is lost in the dark; The manger is lost in the straw, The Christ cries faintly . . . hark! . . . Through bands that swaddle and strangle— But the Pope in the chair of awe Looks down the great quadrangle. III The Magi kneel at his foot, Kings of the East and West, But, instead of the angels (mute Is the “Peace on earth” of their song), The peoples, perplexed and opprest, Are sighing “How long, how long?” IV And, instead of the kine, bewilder in Shadow of aisle and dome, The bear who tore up the children, The fox who burnt up the corn, And the wolf who suckled at Rome Brothers to slay and to scorn. V Cardinals left and right of him, Worshippers round and beneath, The silver trumpets at sight of him Thrill with a musical blast: But the people say through their teeth, “Trumpets? we wait for the Last!” VI He sits in the place of the Lord, And asks for the gifts of the time; Gold, for the haft of a sword To win back Romagna averse, Incense, to sweeten a crime, And myrrh, to embitter a curse. VII Then a king of the West said “Good!— I bring thee the gifts of the time; Red, for the patriot's blood, Green, for the martyr's crown, White, for the dew and the rime, When the morning of God comes down.” VIII —O mystic tricolor bright! The Pope's heart quailed like a man's; The cardinals froze at the sight, Bowing their tonsures hoary: And the eyes in the peacock-fans Winked at the alien glory. IX But the peoples exclaimed in hope, “Now blessed be he who has brought These gifts of the time to the Pope, When our souls were sick and forlorn. —And here is the star we sought, To show us where Christ was born!” ITALY AND THE WORLD. I Florence, Bologna, Parma, Modena: When you named them a year ago, So many graves reserved by God, in a Day of Judgment, you seemed to know, To open and let out the resurrection. II And meantime (you made your reflection If you were English), was nought to be done But sorting sables, in predilection For all those martyrs dead and gone, Till the new earth and heaven made ready. III And if your politics were not heady, Violent, . . . “Good,” you added, “good In all things! Mourn on sure and steady. Churchyard thistles are wholesome food For our European wandering asses. IV “The date of the resurrection passes Human foreknowledge: men unborn Will gain by it (even in the lower classes), But none of these. It is not the morn Because the cock of France is crowing. V “Cocks crow at midnight, seldom knowing Starlight from dawn-light! 'tis a mad Poor creature.” Here you paused, and growing Scornful,—suddenly, let us add, The trumpet sounded, the graves were open. VI Life and life and life! agrope in The dusk of death, warm hands, stretched out For swords, proved more life still to hope in, Beyond and behind. Arise with a shout, Nation of Italy, slain and buried! VII Hill to hill and turret to turret Flashing the tricolor,—newly created Beautiful Italy, calm, unhurried, Rise heroic and renovated, Rise to the final restitution. VIII Rise; prefigure the grand solution Of earth's municipal, insular schisms,— Statesmen draping self-love's conclusion In cheap vernacular patriotisms, Unable to give up Judæa for Jesus. IX Bring us the higher example; release us Into the larger coming time: And into Christ's broad garment piece us Rags of virtue as poor as crime, National selfishness, civic vaunting. X No more Jew nor Greek then,—taunting Nor taunted;—no more England nor France! But one confederate brotherhood planting One flag only, to mark the advance, Onward and upward, of all humanity. XI For civilisation perfected Is fully developed Christianity. “Measure the frontier,” shall it be said, “Count the ships,” in national vanity? —Count the nation's heart-beats sooner. XII For, though behind by a cannon or schooner, That nation still is predominant Whose pulse beats quickest in zeal to oppugn or Succour another, in wrong or want, Passing the frontier in love and abhorrence. XIII Modena, Parma, Bologna, Florence, Open us out the wider way! Dwarf in that chapel of old Saint Lawrence Your Michel Angelo's giant Day, With the grandeur of this Day breaking o'er us! XIV Ye who, restrained as an ancient chorus, Mute while the coryphæus spake, Hush your separate voices before us, Sink your separate lives for the sake Of one sole Italy's living for ever! XV Givers of coat and cloak too,—never Grudging that purple of yours at the best,— By your heroic will and endeavour Each sublimely dispossessed, That all may inherit what each surrenders! XVI Earth shall bless you, O noble emenders On egotist nations! Ye shall lead The plough of the world, and sow new splendours Into the furrow of things for seed,— Ever the richer for what ye have given. XVII Lead us and teach us, till earth and heaven Grow larger around us and higher above. Our sacrament-bread has a bitter leaven; We bait our traps with the name of love, Till hate itself has a kinder meaning. XVIII Oh, this world: this cheating and screening Of cheats! this conscience for candlewicks, Not beacon-fires! this overweening Of underhand diplomatical tricks, Dared for the country while scorned for the counter! XIX Oh, this envy of those who mount here, And oh, this malice to make them trip! Rather quenching the fire there, drying the fount here, To frozen body and thirsty lip, Than leave to a neighbour their ministration. XX I cry aloud in my poet-passion, Viewing my England o'er Alp and sea. I loved her more in her ancient fashion: She carries her rifles too thick for me Who spares them so in the cause of a brother. XXI Suspicion, panic? end this pother. The sword, kept sheathless at peace-time, rusts. None fears for himself while he feels for another: The brave man either fights or trusts, And wears no mail in his private chamber. XXII Beautiful Italy! golden amber Warm with the kisses of lover and traitor! Thou who hast drawn us on to remember, Draw us to hope now: let us be greater By this new future than that old story. XXIII Till truer glory replaces all glory, As the torch grows blind at the dawn of day; And the nations, rising up, their sorry And foolish sins shall put away, As children their toys when the teacher enters. XXIV Till Love's one centre devour these centres Of many self-loves; and the patriot's trick To better his land by egotist ventures, Defamed from a virtue, shall make men sick, As the scalp at the belt of some red hero. XXV For certain virtues have dropped to zero, Left by the sun on the mountain's dewy side; Churchman's charities, tender as Nero, Indian suttee, heathen suicide, Service to rights divine, proved hollow: XXVI And Heptarchy patriotisms must follow. —National voices, distinct yet dependent, Ensphering each other, as swallow does swallow, With circles still widening and ever ascendant, In multiform life to united progression,— XXVII These shall remain. And when, in the session Of nations, the separate language is heard, Each shall aspire, in sublime indiscretion, To help with a thought or exalt with a word Less her own than her rival's honour. XXVIII Each Christian nation shall take upon her The law of the Christian man in vast: The crown of the getter shall fall to the donor, And last shall be first while first shall be last, And to love best shall still be, to reign unsurpassed. A CURSE FOR A NATION. PROLOGUE. I heard an angel speak last night, And he said “Write! Write a Nation's curse for me, And send it over the Western Sea.” I faltered, taking up the word: “Not so, my lord! If curses must be, choose another To send thy curse against my brother. “For I am bound by gratitude, By love and blood, To brothers of mine across the sea, Who stretch out kindly hands to me.” “Therefore,” the voice said, “shalt thou write My curse to-night. From the summits of love a curse is driven, As lightning is from the tops of heaven.” “Not so,” I answered. “Evermore My heart is sore For my own land's sins: for little feet Of children bleeding along the street: “For parked-up honours that gainsay The right of way: For almsgiving through a door that is Not open enough for two friends to kiss: “For love of freedom which abates Beyond the Straits: For patriot virtue starved to vice on Self-praise, self-interest, and suspicion: “For an oligarchic parliament, And bribes well-meant. What curse to another land assign, When heavy-souled for the sins of mine?” “Therefore,” the voice said, “shalt thou write My curse to-night. Because thou hast strength to see and hate A foul thing done within thy gate.” “Not so,” I answered once again. “To curse, choose men. For I, a woman, have only known How the heart melts and the tears run down.” “Therefore,” the voice said, “shalt thou write My curse to-night. Some women weep and curse, I say (And no one marvels), night and day. “And thou shalt take their part to-night, Weep and write. A curse from the depths of womanhood Is very salt, and bitter, and good.” So thus I wrote, and mourned indeed, What all may read. And thus, as was enjoined on me, I send it over the Western Sea. THE CURSE. I. Because ye have broken your own chain With the strain Of brave men climbing a Nation's height, Yet thence bear down with brand and thong On souls of others,—for this wrong This is the curse. Write. Because yourselves are standing straight In the state Of Freedom's foremost acolyte, Yet keep calm footing all the time On writhing bond-slaves,—for this crime This is the curse. Write. Because ye prosper in God's name, With a claim To honour in the old world's sight, Yet do the fiend's work perfectly In strangling martyrs,—for this lie This is the curse. Write. II. Ye shall watch while kings conspire Round the people's smouldering fire, And, warm for your part, Shall never dare—O shame! To utter the thought into flame Which burns at your heart. This is the curse. Write. Ye shall watch while nations strive With the bloodhounds, die or survive, Drop faint from their jaws, Or throttle them backward to death; And only under your breath Shall favour the cause. This is the curse. Write. Ye shall watch while strong men draw The nets of feudal law To strangle the weak; And, counting the sin for a sin, Your soul shall be sadder within Than the word ye shall speak. This is the curse. Write. When good men are praying erect That Christ may avenge His elect And deliver the earth, The prayer in your ears, said low, Shall sound like the tramp of a foe That's driving you forth. This is the curse. Write. When wise men give you their praise, They shall pause in the heat of the phrase, As if carried too far. When ye boast your own charters kept true, Ye shall blush; for the thing which ye do Derides what ye are. This is the curse. Write. When fools cast taunts at your gate, Your scorn ye shall somewhat abate As ye look o'er the wall; For your conscience, tradition, and name Explode with a deadlier blame Than the worst of them all. This is the curse. Write. Go, wherever ill deeds shall be done, Go, plant your flag in the sun Beside the ill-doers! And recoil from clenching the curse Of God's witnessing Universe With a curse of yours. This is the curse. Write.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LAST POEMS. 1862. TO “GRATEFUL FLORENCE,” TO THE MUNICIPALITY, HER REPRESENTATIVE, AND TO TOMMASEO, ITS SPOKESMAN, MOST GRATEFULLY. LITTLE MATTIE. I Dead! Thirteen a month ago! Short and narrow her life's walk; Lover's love she could not know Even by a dream or talk: Too young to be glad of youth, Missing honour, labour, rest, And the warmth of a babe's mouth At the blossom of her breast. Must you pity her for this And for all the loss it is, You, her mother, with wet face, Having had all in your case? II Just so young but yesternight, Now she is as old as death. Meek, obedient in your sight, Gentle to a beck or breath Only on last Monday! Yours, Answering you like silver bells Lightly touched! An hour matures: You can teach her nothing else. She has seen the mystery hid Under Egypt's pyramid: By those eyelids pale and close Now she knows what Rhamses knows. III Cross her quiet hands, and smooth Down her patient locks of silk, Cold and passive as in truth You your fingers in spilt milk Drew along a marble floor; But her lips you cannot wring Into saying a word more, “Yes,” or “No,” or such a thing: Though you call and beg and wreak Half your soul out in a shriek, She will lie there in default And most innocent revolt. IV Ay, and if she spoke, maybe She would answer, like the Son, “What is now 'twixt thee and me?” Dreadful answer! better none. Yours on Monday, God's to-day! Yours, your child, your blood, your heart, Called . . . you called her, did you say, “Little Mattie” for your part? Now already it sounds strange, And you wonder, in this change, What He calls His angel-creature, Higher up than you can reach her. V 'Twas a green and easy world As she took it; room to play (Though one's hair might get uncurled At the far end of the day). What she suffered she shook off In the sunshine; what she sinned She could pray on high enough To keep safe above the wind. If reproved by God or you, 'Twas to better her, she knew; And if crossed, she gathered still 'Twas to cross out something ill. VI You, you had the right, you thought, To survey her with sweet scorn, Poor gay child, who had not caught Yet the octave-stretch forlorn Of your larger wisdom! Nay, Now your places are changed so, In that same superior way She regards you dull and low As you did herself exempt From life's sorrows. Grand contempt Of the spirits risen awhile, Who look back with such a smile! VII There's the sting of't. That, I think, Hurts the most a thousandfold! To feel sudden, at a wink, Some dear child we used to scold, Praise, love both ways, kiss and tease, Teach and tumble as our own, All its curls about our knees, Rise up suddenly full-grown. Who could wonder such a sight Made a woman mad outright? Show me Michael with the sword Rather than such angels, Lord! A FALSE STEP. I Sweet, thou hast trod on a heart. Pass; there's a world full of men; And women as fair as thou art Must do such things now and then. II Thou only hast stepped unaware,— Malice, not one can impute; And why should a heart have been there In the way of a fair woman's foot? III It was not a stone that could trip, Nor was it a thorn that could rend: Put up thy proud under-lip! 'Twas merely the heart of a friend. IV And yet peradventure one day Thou, sitting alone at the glass, Remarking the bloom gone away, Where the smile in its dimplement was, V And seeking around thee in vain From hundreds who flattered before, Such a word as “Oh, not in the main Do I hold thee less precious, but more!” . . . VI Thou'lt sigh, very like, on thy part, “Of all I have known or can know, I wish I had only that Heart I trod upon ages ago!” VOID IN LAW. I Sleep, little babe, on my knee, Sleep, for the midnight is chill, And the moon has died out in the tree, And the great human world goeth ill. Sleep, for the wicked agree: Sleep, let them do as they will. Sleep. II Sleep, thou hast drawn from my breast The last drop of milk that was good; And now, in a dream, suck the rest, Lest the real should trouble thy blood. Suck, little lips dispossessed, As we kiss in the air whom we would. Sleep. III O lips of thy father! the same, So like! Very deeply they swore When he gave me his ring and his name, To take back, I imagined, no more! And now is all changed like a game, Though the old cards are used as of yore? Sleep. IV “Void in law,” said the Courts. Something wrong In the forms? Yet, “Till death part us two, I, James, take thee, Jessie,” was strong, And One witness competent. True Such a marriage was worth an old song, Heard in Heaven though, as plain as the New. Sleep. V Sleep, little child, his and mine! Her throat has the antelope curve, And her cheek just the colour and line Which fade not before him nor swerve: Yet she has no child!—the divine Seal of right upon loves that deserve. Sleep. VI My child! though the world take her part, Saying “She was the woman to choose; He had eyes, was a man in his heart,”— We twain the decision refuse: We . . . weak as I am, as thou art, . . . Cling on to him, never to loose. Sleep. VII He thinks that, when done with this place, All's ended? he'll new-stamp the ore? Yes, Cæsar's—but not in our case. Let him learn we are waiting before The grave's mouth, the heaven's gate, God's face, With implacable love evermore. Sleep. VIII He's ours, though he kissed her but now, He's ours, though she kissed in reply: He's ours, though himself disavow, And God's universe favour the lie; Ours to claim, ours to clasp, ours below, Ours above, . . . if we live, if we die. Sleep. IX Ah baby, my baby, too rough Is my lullaby? What have I said? Sleep! When I've wept long enough I shall learn to weep softly instead, And piece with some alien stuff My heart to lie smooth for thy head. Sleep. X Two souls met upon thee, my sweet; Two loves led thee out to the sun: Alas, pretty hands, pretty feet, If the one who remains (only one) Set her grief at thee, turned in a heat To thine enemy,—were it well done? Sleep. XI May He of the manger stand near And love thee! An infant He came To His own who rejected Him here, But the Magi brought gifts all the same. I hurry the cross on my Dear! My gifts are the griefs I declaim! Sleep. LORD WALTER'S WIFE. I “But why do you go?” said the lady, while both sat under the yew, And her eyes were alive in their depth, as the kraken beneath the sea-blue. II “Because I fear you,” he answered;—“because you are far too fair, And able to strangle my soul in a mesh of your gold-coloured hair.” III “Oh, that,” she said, “is no reason! Such knots are quickly undone, And too much beauty, I reckon, is nothing but too much sun.” IV “Yet farewell so,” he answered;—“the sun-stroke's fatal at times. I value your husband, Lord Walter, whose gallop rings still from the limes.” V “Oh, that,” she said, “is no reason. You smell a rose through a fence: If two should smell it, what matter? who grumbles, and where's the pretence?” VI “But I,” he replied, “have promised another, when love was free, To love her alone, alone, who alone and afar loves me.” VII “Why, that,” she said, “is no reason. Love's always free, I am told. Will you vow to be safe from the headache on Tuesday, and think it will hold?” VIII “But you,” he replied, “have a daughter, a young little child, who was laid In your lap to be pure; so I leave you: the angels would make me afraid.” IX “Oh, that,” she said, “is no reason. The angels keep out of the way; And Dora, the child, observes nothing, although you should please me and stay.” X At which he rose up in his anger,—“Why, now, you no longer are fair! Why, now, you no longer are fatal, but ugly and hateful, I swear.” XI At which she laughed out in her scorn: “These men! Oh, these men overnice, Who are shocked if a colour not virtuous is frankly put on by a vice.” XII Her eyes blazed upon him—“And you! You bring us your vices so near That we smell them! You think in our presence a thought 'twould defame us to hear! XIII “What reason had you, and what right,—I appeal to your soul from my life,— To find me too fair as a woman? Why, sir, I am pure, and a wife. XIV “Is the day-star too fair up above you? It burns you not. Dare you imply I brushed you more close than the star does, when Walter had set me as high? XV “If a man finds a woman too fair, he means simply adapted too much To uses unlawful and fatal. The praise!—shall I thank you for such? XVI “Too fair?—not unless you misuse us! and surely if, once in a while, You attain to it, straightway you call us no longer too fair, but too vile. XVII “A moment,—I pray your attention!—I have a poor word in my head I must utter, though womanly custom would set it down better unsaid. XVIII “You grew, sir, pale to impertinence, once when I showed you a ring. You kissed my fan when I dropped it. No matter!—I've broken the thing. XIX “You did me the honour, perhaps, to be moved at my side now and then In the senses—a vice, I have heard, which is common to beasts and some men. XX “Love's a virtue for heroes!—as white as the snow on high hills, And immortal as every great soul is that struggles, endures, and fulfils. XXI “I love my Walter profoundly,—you, Maude, though you faltered a week, For the sake of . . . what was it—an eyebrow? or, less still, a mole on a cheek? XXII “And since, when all's said, you're too noble to stoop to the frivolous cant About crimes irresistible, virtues that swindle, betray and supplant, XXIII “I determined to prove to yourself that, whate'er you might dream or avow By illusion, you wanted precisely no more of me than you have now. XXIV “There! Look me full in the face!—in the face. Understand, if you can, That the eyes of such women as I am are clean as the palm of a man. XXV “Drop his hand, you insult him. Avoid us for fear we should cost you a scar— You take us for harlots, I tell you, and not for the women we are. XXVI “You wronged me: but then I considered . . . there's Walter! And so at the end I vowed that he should not be mulcted, by me, in the hand of a friend. XXVII “Have I hurt you indeed? We are quits then. Nay, friend of my Walter, be mine! Come, Dora, my darling, my angel, and help me to ask him to dine.” BIANCA AMONG THE NIGHTINGALES. I The cypress stood up like a church That night we felt our love would hold, And saintly moonlight seemed to search And wash the whole world clean as gold; The olives crystallised the vales' Broad slopes until the hills grew strong: The fire-flies and the nightingales Throbbed each to either, flame and song. The nightingales, the nightingales! II Upon the angle of its shade The cypress stood, self-balanced high; Half up, half down, as double-made, Along the ground, against the sky; And we, too! from such soul-height went Such leaps of blood, so blindly driven, We scarce knew if our nature meant Most passionate earth or intense heaven. The nightingales, the nightingales! III We paled with love, we shook with love, We kissed so close we could not vow; Till Giulio whispered “Sweet, above God's Ever guaranties this Now.” And through his words the nightingales Drove straight and full their long clear call, Like arrows through heroic mails, And love was awful in it all. The nightingales, the nightingales! IV O cold white moonlight of the north, Refresh these pulses, quench this hell! O coverture of death drawn forth Across this garden-chamber . . . well! But what have nightingales to do In gloomy England, called the free . . . (Yes, free to die in! . . .) when we two Are sundered, singing still to me? And still they sing, the nightingales! V I think I hear him, how he cried “My own soul's life!” between their notes. Each man has but one soul supplied, And that's immortal. Though his throat's On fire with passion now, to her He can't say what to me he said! And yet he moves her, they aver. The nightingales sing through my head,— The nightingales, the nightingales! VI He says to her what moves her most. He would not name his soul within Her hearing,—rather pays her cost With praises to her lips and chin. Man has but one soul, 'tis ordained, And each soul but one love, I add; Yet souls are damned and love's profaned; These nightingales will sing me mad! The nightingales, the nightingales! VII I marvel how the birds can sing. There's little difference, in their view, Betwixt our Tuscan trees that spring As vital flames into the blue, And dull round blots of foliage meant, Like saturated sponges here To suck the fogs up. As content Is he too in this land, 'tis clear. And still they sing, the nightingales. VIII My native Florence! dear, forgone! I see across the Alpine ridge How the last feast-day of Saint John Shot rockets from Carraia bridge. The luminous city, tall with fire, Trod deep down in that river of ours, While many a boat with lamp and choir Skimmed birdlike over glittering towers. I will not hear these nightingales. IX I seem to float, we seem to float Down Arno's stream in festive guise; A boat strikes flame into our boat, And up that lady seems to rise As then she rose. The shock had flashed A vision on us! What a head, What leaping eyeballs!—beauty dashed To splendour by a sudden dread. And still they sing, the nightingales. X Too bold to sin, too weak to die; Such women are so. As for me, I would we had drowned there, he and I, That moment, loving perfectly. He had not caught her with her loosed Gold ringlets . . . rarer in the south . . . Nor heard the “Grazie tanto” bruised To sweetness by her English mouth. And still they sing, the nightingales. XI She had not reached him at my heart With her fine tongue, as snakes indeed Kill flies; nor had I, for my part, Yearned after, in my desperate need, And followed him as he did her To coasts left bitter by the tide, Whose very nightingales, elsewhere Delighting, torture and deride! For still they sing, the nightingales. XII A worthless woman; mere cold clay As all false things are: but so fair, She takes the breath of men away Who gaze upon her unaware. I would not play her larcenous tricks To have her looks! She lied and stole, And spat into my love's pure pyx The rank saliva of her soul. And still they sing, the nightingales. XIII I would not for her white and pink, Though such he likes—her grace of limb, Though such he has praised—nor yet, I think, For life itself, though spent with him, Commit such sacrilege, affront God's nature which is love, intrude 'Twixt two affianced souls, and hunt Like spiders, in the altar's wood. I cannot bear these nightingales. XIV If she chose sin, some gentler guise She might have sinned in, so it seems: She might have pricked out both my eyes, And I still seen him in my dreams! —Or drugged me in my soup or wine, Nor left me angry afterward: To die here with his hand in mine, His breath upon me, were not hard. (Our Lady hush these nightingales!) XV But set a springe for him, “mio ben,” My only good, my first last love!— Though Christ knows well what sin is, when He sees some things done they must move Himself to wonder. Let her pass. I think of her by night and day. Must I too join her . . . out, alas! . . . With Giulio, in each word I say? And evermore the nightingales! XVI Giulio, my Giulio!—sing they so, And you be silent? Do I speak, And you not hear? An arm you throw Round some one, and I feel so weak? —Oh, owl-like birds! They sing for spite, They sing for hate, they sing for doom, They'll sing through death who sing through night, They'll sing and stun me in the tomb— The nightingales, the nightingales! MY KATE. I She was not as pretty as women I know, And yet all your best made of sunshine and snow Drop to shade, melt to nought in the long-trodden ways, While she's still remembered on warm and cold days— My Kate. II Her air had a meaning, her movements a grace; You turned from the fairest to gaze on her face: And when you had once seen her forehead and mouth, You saw as distinctly her soul and her truth— My Kate. III Such a blue inner light from her eyelids outbroke, You looked at her silence and fancied she spoke: When she did, so peculiar yet soft was the tone, Though the loudest spoke also, you heard her alone— My Kate. IV I doubt if she said to you much that could act As a thought or suggestion: she did not attract In the sense of the brilliant or wise: I infer 'Twas her thinking of others made you think of her— My Kate. V She never found fault with you, never implied Your wrong by her right; and yet men at her side Grew nobler, girls purer, as through the whole town The children were gladder that pulled at her gown— My Kate. VI None knelt at her feet confessed lovers in thrall; They knelt more to God than they used,—that was all: If you praised her as charming, some asked what you meant, But the charm of her presence was felt when she went— My Kate. VII The weak and the gentle, the ribald and rude, She took as she found them, and did them all good; It always was so with her—see what you have! She has made the grass greener even here . . . with her grave— My Kate. VIII My dear one!—when thou wast alive with the rest, I held thee the sweetest and loved thee the best: And now thou art dead, shall I not take thy part As thy smiles used to do for thyself, my sweet Heart— My Kate? A SONG FOR THE RAGGED SCHOOLS OF LONDON. WRITTEN IN ROME. I I am listening here in Rome. “England's strong,” say many speakers, “If she winks, the Czar must come, Prow and topsail, to the breakers.” II “England's rich in coal and oak,” Adds a Roman, getting moody; “If she shakes a travelling cloak, Down our Appian roll the scudi.” III “England's righteous,” they rejoin: “Who shall grudge her exaltations, When her wealth of golden coin Works the welfare of the nations?” IV I am listening here in Rome. Over Alps a voice is sweeping— “England's cruel, save us some Of these victims in her keeping!” V As the cry beneath the wheel Of an old triumphant Roman Cleft the people's shouts like steel, While the show was spoilt for no man, VI Comes that voice. Let others shout, Other poets praise my land here: I am sadly sitting out, Praying, “God forgive her grandeur.” VII Shall we boast of empire, where Time with ruin sits commissioned? In God's liberal blue air Peter's dome itself looks wizened; VIII And the mountains, in disdain, Gather back their lights of opal From the dumb despondent plain Heaped with jawbones of a people. IX Lordly English, think it o'er, Cæsar's doing is all undone! You have cannons on your shore, And free Parliaments in London; X Princes' parks, and merchants' homes, Tents for soldiers, ships for seamen,— Ay, but ruins worse than Rome's In your pauper men and women. XI Women leering through the gas (Just such bosoms used to nurse you), Men, turned wolves by famine—pass! Those can speak themselves, and curse you. XII But these others—children small, Spilt like blots about the city, Quay, and street, and palace-wall— Take them up into your pity! XIII Ragged children with bare feet, Whom the angels in white raiment Know the names of, to repeat When they come on you for payment. XIV Ragged children, hungry-eyed, Huddled up out of the coldness On your doorsteps, side by side, Till your footman damns their boldness. XV In the alleys, in the squares, Begging, lying little rebels; In the noisy thoroughfares, Struggling on with piteous trebles. XVI Patient children—think what pain Makes a young child patient—ponder! Wronged too commonly to strain After right, or wish, or wonder. XVII Wicked children, with peaked chins, And old foreheads! there are many With no pleasures except sins, Gambling with a stolen penny. XVIII Sickly children, that whine low To themselves and not their mothers, From mere habit,—never so Hoping help or care from others. XIX Healthy children, with those blue English eyes, fresh from their Maker, Fierce and ravenous, staring through At the brown loaves of the baker. XX I am listening here in Rome, And the Romans are confessing, “English children pass in bloom All the prettiest made for blessing. XXI “Angli angeli!” (resumed From the mediæval story) “Such rose angelhoods, emplumed In such ringlets of pure glory!” XXII Can we smooth down the bright hair, O my sisters, calm, unthrilled in Our heart's pulses? Can we bear The sweet looks of our own children, XXIII While those others, lean and small, Scurf and mildew of the city, Spot our streets, convict us all Till we take them into pity? XXIV “Is it our fault?” you reply, “When, throughout civilisation, Every nation's empery Is asserted by starvation? XXV “All these mouths we cannot feed, And we cannot clothe these bodies.” Well, if man's so hard indeed, Let them learn at least what God is! XXVI Little outcasts from life's fold, The grave's hope they may be joined in, By Christ's covenant consoled For our social contract's grinding. XXVII If no better can be done, Let us do but this,—endeavour That the sun behind the sun Shine upon them while they shiver! XXVIII On the dismal London flags, Through the cruel social juggle, Put a thought beneath their rags To ennoble the heart's struggle. XXIX O my sisters, not so much Are we asked for—not a blossom From our children's nosegay, such As we gave it from our bosom, XXX Not the milk left in their cup, Not the lamp while they are sleeping, Not the little cloak hung up While the coat's in daily keeping,— XXXI But a place in Ragged Schools, Where the outcasts may to-morrow Learn by gentle words and rules Just the uses of their sorrow. XXXII O my sisters! children small, Blue-eyed, wailing through the city— Our own babes cry in them all: Let us take them into pity. MAY'S LOVE. I You love all, you say, Round, beneath, above me: Find me then some way Better than to love me, Me, too, dearest May! II O world-kissing eyes Which the blue heavens melt to; I, sad, overwise, Loathe the sweet looks dealt to All things—men and flies. III You love all, you say: Therefore, Dear, abate me Just your love, I pray! Shut your eyes and hate me— Only me—fair May! AMY'S CRUELTY I Fair Amy of the terraced house, Assist me to discover Why you who would not hurt a mouse Can torture so your lover. II You give your coffee to the cat, You stroke the dog for coming, And all your face grows kinder at The little brown bee's humming. III But when he haunts your door . . . the town Marks coming and marks going . . . You seem to have stitched your eyelids down To that long piece of sewing! IV You never give a look, not you, Nor drop him a “Good morning,” To keep his long day warm and blue, So fretted by your scorning. V She shook her head—“The mouse and bee For crumb or flower will linger: The dog is happy at my knee, The cat purrs at my finger. VI “But he . . . to him, the least thing given Means great things at a distance; He wants my world, my sun, my heaven, Soul, body, whole existence. VII “They say love gives as well as takes; But I'm a simple maiden,— My mother's first smile when she wakes I still have smiled and prayed in. VIII “I only know my mother's love Which gives all and asks nothing; And this new loving sets the groove Too much the way of loathing. IX “Unless he gives me all in change, I forfeit all things by him: The risk is terrible and strange— I tremble, doubt, . . . deny him. X “He's sweetest friend or hardest foe, Best angel or worst devil; I either hate or . . . love him so, I can't be merely civil! XI “You trust a woman who puts forth Her blossoms thick as summer's? You think she dreams what love is worth, Who casts it to new-comers? XII “Such love's a cowslip-ball to fling, A moment's pretty pastime; I give . . . all me, if anything, The first time and the last time. XIII “Dear neighbour of the trellised house, A man should murmur never, Though treated worse than dog and mouse, Till doated on for ever!” MY HEART AND I. I Enough! we're tired, my heart and I. We sit beside the headstone thus, And wish that name were carved for us. The moss reprints more tenderly The hard types of the mason's knife, As heaven's sweet life renews earth's life With which we're tired, my heart and I. II You see we're tired, my heart and I. We dealt with books, we trusted men, And in our own blood drenched the pen, As if such colours could not fly. We walked too straight for fortune's end, We loved too true to keep a friend; At last we're tired, my heart and I. III How tired we feel, my heart and I! We seem of no use in the world; Our fancies hang grey and uncurled About men's eyes indifferently; Our voice which thrilled you so, will let You sleep; our tears are only wet: What do we here, my heart and I? IV So tired, so tired, my heart and I! It was not thus in that old time When Ralph sat with me 'neath the lime To watch the sunset from the sky. “Dear love, you're looking tired,” he said; I, smiling at him, shook my head: 'Tis now we're tired, my heart and I. V So tired, so tired, my heart and I! Though now none takes me on his arm To fold me close and kiss me warm Till each quick breath end in a sigh Of happy languor. Now, alone, We lean upon this graveyard stone, Uncheered, unkissed, my heart and I. VI Tired out we are, my heart and I. Suppose the world brought diadems To tempt us, crusted with loose gems Of powers and pleasures? Let it try. We scarcely care to look at even A pretty child, or God's blue heaven, We feel so tired, my heart and I. VII Yet who complains? My heart and I? In this abundant earth no doubt Is little room for things worn out: Disdain them, break them, throw them by! And if before the days grew rough We once were loved, used,—well enough, I think, we've fared, my heart and I. THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD. What's the best thing in the world? June-rose, by May-dew impearled; Sweet south-wind, that means no rain; Truth, not cruel to a friend; Pleasure, not in haste to end; Beauty, not self-decked and curled Till its pride is over-plain; Light, that never makes you wink; Memory, that gives no pain; Love, when, so, you're loved again. What's the best thing in the world? —Something out of it, I think. WHERE'S AGNES? I Nay, if I had come back so, And found her dead in her grave, And if a friend I know Had said, “Be strong, nor rave: She lies there, dead below: II “I saw her, I who speak, White, stiff, the face one blank: The blue shade came to her cheek Before they nailed the plank, For she had been dead a week.” III Why, if he had spoken so, I might have believed the thing, Although her look, although Her step, laugh, voice's ring Lived in me still as they do. IV But dead that other way, Corrupted thus and lost? That sort of worm in the clay? I cannot count the cost, That I should rise and pay. V My Agnes false? such shame? She? Rather be it said That the pure saint of her name Has stood there in her stead, And tricked you to this blame. VI Her very gown, her cloak Fell chastely: no disguise, But expression! while she broke With her clear grey morning-eyes Full upon me and then spoke. VII She wore her hair away From her forehead,—like a cloud Which a little wind in May Peels off finely: disallowed Though bright enough to stay. VIII For the heavens must have the place To themselves, to use and shine in, As her soul would have her face To press through upon mine, in That orb of angel grace. IX Had she any fault at all, 'Twas having none, I thought too— There seemed a sort of thrall; As she felt her shadow ought to Fall straight upon the wall. X Her sweetness strained the sense Of common life and duty; And every day's expense Of moving in such beauty Required, almost, defence. XI What good, I thought, is done By such sweet things, if any? This world smells ill i' the sun Though the garden-flowers are many,— She is only one. XII Can a voice so low and soft Take open actual part With Right,—maintain aloft Pure truth in life or art, Vexed always, wounded oft?— XIII She fit, with that fair pose Which melts from curve to curve, To stand, run, work with those Who wrestle and deserve, And speak plain without glose? XIV But I turned round on my fear Defiant, disagreeing— What if God has set her here Less for action than for Being?— For the eye and for the ear. XV Just to show what beauty may, Just to prove what music can,— And then to die away From the presence of a man, Who shall learn, henceforth, to pray? XVI As a door, left half ajar In heaven, would make him think How heavenly-different are Things glanced at through the chink, Till he pined from near to far. XVII That door could lead to hell? That shining merely meant Damnation? What! She fell Like a woman, who was sent Like an angel, by a spell? XVIII She, who scarcely trod the earth, Turned mere dirt? My Agnes,—mine! Called so! felt of too much worth To be used so! too divine To be breathed near, and so forth! XIX Why, I dared not name a sin In her presence: I went round, Clipped its name and shut it in Some mysterious crystal sound,— Changed the dagger for the pin. XX Now you name herself that word? O my Agnes! O my saint! Then the great joys of the Lord Do not last? Then all this paint Runs off nature? leaves a board? XXI Who's dead here? No, not she: Rather I! or whence this damp Cold corruption's misery? While my very mourners stamp Closer in the clods on me. XXII And my mouth is full of dust Till I cannot speak and curse— Speak and damn him . . . “Blame's unjust”? Sin blots out the universe, All because she would and must? XXIII She, my white rose, dropping off The high rose-tree branch! and not That the night-wind blew too rough, Or the noon-sun burnt too hot, But, that being a rose—'twas enough! XXIV Then henceforth may earth grow trees! No more roses!—hard straight lines To score lies out! none of these Fluctuant curves, but firs and pines, Poplars, cedars, cypresses! DE PROFUNDIS. I The face which, duly as the sun, Rose up for me with life begun, To mark all bright hours of the day With hourly love, is dimmed away,— And yet my days go on, go on. II The tongue which, like a stream, could run Smooth music from the roughest stone, And every morning with “Good day” Make each day good, is hushed away,— And yet my days go on, go on. III The heart which, like a staff, was one For mine to lean and rest upon, The strongest on the longest day With steadfast love, is caught away,— And yet my days go on, go on. IV And cold before my summer's done, And deaf in Nature's general tune, And fallen too low for special fear, And here, with hope no longer here,— While the tears drop, my days go on. V The world goes whispering to its own, “This anguish pierces to the bone;” And tender friends go sighing round, “What love can ever cure this wound?” My days go on, my days go on. VI The past rolls forward on the sun And makes all night. O dreams begun, Not to be ended! Ended bliss, And life that will not end in this! My days go on, my days go on. VII Breath freezes on my lips to moan: As one alone, once not alone, I sit and knock at Nature's door, Heart-bare, heart-hungry, very poor, Whose desolated days go on. VIII I knock and cry,—Undone, undone! Is there no help, no comfort,—none? No gleaning in the wide wheat-plains Where others drive their loaded wains? My vacant days go on, go on. IX This Nature, though the snows be down, Thinks kindly of the bird of June: The little red hip on the tree Is ripe for such. What is for me, Whose days so winterly go on? X No bird am I, to sing in June, And dare not ask an equal boon. Good nests and berries red are Nature's To give away to better creatures,— And yet my days go on, go on. XI I ask less kindness to be done,— Only to loose these pilgrim-shoon, (Too early worn and grimed) with sweet Cool deathly touch to these tired feet. Till days go out which now go on. XII Only to lift the turf unmown From off the earth where it has grown, Some cubit-space, and say “Behold, Creep in, poor Heart, beneath that fold, Forgetting how the days go on.” XIII What harm would that do? Green anon The sward would quicken, overshone By skies as blue; and crickets might Have leave to chirp there day and night While my new rest went on, went on. XIV From gracious Nature have I won Such liberal bounty? may I run So, lizard-like, within her side, And there be safe, who now am tried By days that painfully go on? XV —A Voice reproves me thereupon, More sweet than Nature's when the drone Of bees is sweetest, and more deep Than when the rivers overleap The shuddering pines, and thunder on. XVI God's Voice, not Nature's! Night and noon He sits upon the great white throne And listens for the creatures' praise. What babble we of days and days? The Day-spring He, whose days go on. XVII He reigns above, He reigns alone; Systems burn out and leave His throne; Fair mists of seraphs melt and fall Around Him, changeless amid all,— Ancient of Days, whose days go on. XVIII He reigns below, He reigns alone, And, having life in love forgone Beneath the crown of sovran thorns, He reigns the Jealous God. Who mourns Or rules with Him, while days go on? XIX By anguish which made pale the sun, I hear Him charge His saints that none Among His creatures anywhere Blaspheme against Him with despair, However darkly days go on. XX Take from my head the thorn-wreath brown! No mortal grief deserves that crown. O sùpreme Love, chief misery, The sharp regalia are for Thee Whose days eternally go on! XXI For us,—whatever's undergone, Thou knowest, willest what is done. Grief may be joy misunderstood; Only the Good discerns the good. I trust Thee while my days go on. XXII Whatever's lost, it first was won; We will not struggle nor impugn. Perhaps the cup was broken here, That Heaven's new wine might show more clear. I praise Thee while my days go on. XXIII I praise Thee while my days go on; I love Thee while my days go on: Through dark and dearth, through fire and frost, With emptied arms and treasure lost, I thank Thee while my days go on. XXIV And having in thy life-depth thrown Being and suffering (which are one), As a child drops his pebble small Down some deep well, and hears it fall Smiling—so I. Thy days go on. A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT. I What was he doing, the great god Pan, Down in the reeds by the river? Spreading ruin and scattering ban, Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat, And breaking the golden lilies afloat With the dragon-fly on the river. II He tore out a reed, the great god Pan, From the deep cool bed of the river: The limpid water turbidly ran, And the broken lilies a-dying lay, And the dragon-fly had fled away, Ere he brought it out of the river. III High on the shore sat the great god Pan While turbidly flowed the river; And hacked and hewed as a great god can, With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed, Till there was not a sign of the leaf indeed To prove it fresh from the river. IV He cut it short, did the great god Pan, (How tall it stood in the river!) Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man, Steadily from the outside ring, And notched the poor dry empty thing In holes, as he sat by the river. V “This is the way,” laughed the great god Pan (Laughed while he sat by the river), “The only way, since gods began To make sweet music, they could succeed.” Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed, He blew in power by the river. VI Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan! Piercing sweet by the river! Blinding sweet, O great god Pan! The sun on the hill forgot to die, And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly Came back to dream on the river. VII Yet half a beast is the great god Pan, To laugh as he sits by the river, Making a poet out of a man: The true gods sigh for the cost and pain,— For the reed which grows nevermore again As a reed with the reeds in the river. FIRST NEWS FROM VILLAFRANCA. I Peace, peace, peace, do you say? What!—with the enemy's guns in our ears? With the country's wrong not rendered back? What!—while Austria stands at bay In Mantua, and our Venice bears The cursed flag of the yellow and black? II Peace, peace, peace, do you say? And this the Mincio? Where's the fleet, And where's the sea? Are we all blind Or mad with the blood shed yesterday, Ignoring Italy under our feet, And seeing things before, behind? III Peace, peace, peace, do you say? What!—uncontested, undenied? Because we triumph, we succumb? A pair of Emperors stand in the way (One of whom is a man, beside), To sign and seal our cannons dumb? IV No, not Napoleon!—he who mused At Paris, and at Milan spake, And at Solferino led the fight: Not he we trusted, honoured, used Our hopes and hearts for . . . till they break Even so, you tell us . . . in his sight. V Peace, peace, is still your word? We say you lie then!—that is plain. There is no peace, and shall be none. Our very Dead would cry “Absurd!” And clamour that they died in vain, And whine to come back to the sun. VI Hush! more reverence for the Dead! They've done the most for Italy Evermore since the earth was fair. Now would that we had died instead, Still dreaming peace meant liberty, And did not, could not, mean despair. VII Peace, you say?—yes, peace, in truth! But such a peace as the ear can achieve 'Twixt the rifle's click and the rush of the ball, 'Twixt the tiger's spring and the crunch of the tooth, 'Twixt the dying atheist's negative And God's Face—waiting, after all! KING VICTOR EMANUEL ENTERING FLORENCE, APRIL 1860. I King of us all, we cried to thee, cried to thee, Trampled to earth by the beasts impure, Dragged by the chariots which shame as they roll: The dust of our torment far and wide to thee Went up, dark'ning thy royal soul. Be witness, Cavour, That the King was sad for the people in thrall, This King of us all! II King, we cried to thee! Strong in replying, Thy word and thy sword sprang rapid and sure, Cleaving our way to a nation's place. Oh, first soldier of Italy!—crying Now grateful, exultant, we look in thy face. Be witness, Cavour, That, freedom's first soldier, the freed should call First King of them all! III This is our beautiful Italy's birthday; High-thoughted souls, whether many or fewer, Bring her the gift, and wish her the good, While Heaven presents on this sunny earth-day The noble King to the land renewed: Be witness, Cavour! Roar, cannon-mouths! Proclaim, install The King of us all! IV Grave he rides through the Florence gateway, Clenching his face into calm, to immure His struggling heart till it half disappears; If he relaxed for a moment, straightway He would break out into passionate tears— (Be witness, Cavour!) While rings the cry without interval, “Live, King of us all!” V Cry, free peoples! Honour the nation By crowning the true man—and none is truer: Pisa is here, and Livorno is here, And thousands of faces, in wild exultation, Burn over the windows to feel him near— (Be witness, Cavour!) Burn over from terrace, roof, window and wall, On this King of us all. VI Grave! A good man's ever the graver For bearing a nation's trust secure; And he, he thinks of the Heart, beside, Which broke for Italy, failing to save her, And pining away by Oporto's tide: Be witness, Cavour, That he thinks of his vow on that royal pall, This King of us all. VII Flowers, flowers, from the flowery city! Such innocent thanks for a deed so pure, As, melting away for joy into flowers, The nation invites him to enter his Pitti And evermore reign in this Florence of ours. Be witness, Cavour! He'll stand where the reptiles were used to crawl, This King of us all. VIII Grave, as the manner of noble men is— Deeds unfinished will weigh on the doer: And, baring his head to those crape-veiled flags, He bows to the grief of the South and Venice. Oh, riddle the last of the yellow to rags, And swear by Cavour That the King shall reign where the tyrants fall, True King of us all! THE SWORD OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI. “Questa è per me.” —King Victor Emanuel. I When Victor Emanuel the King Went down to his Lucca that day, The people, each vaunting the thing As he gave it, gave all things away,— In a burst of fierce gratitude, say, As they tore out their hearts for the King. II —Gave the green forest-walk on the wall, With the Apennine blue through the trees; Gave the palaces, churches, and all The great pictures which burn out of these: But the eyes of the King seemed to freeze As he gazed upon ceiling and wall. III “Good,” said the King as he passed. Was he cold to the arts?—or else coy To possession? or crossed, at the last (Whispered some), by the vote in Savoy? Shout! Love him enough for his joy! “Good,” said the King as he passed. IV He, travelling the whole day through flowers And protesting amenities, found At Pistoia, betwixt the two showers Of red roses, the “Orphans” (renowned As the heirs of Puccini) who wound With a sword through the crowd and the flowers. V “'Tis the sword of Castruccio, O King,— In that strife of intestinal hate, Very famous! Accept what we bring, We who cannot be sons, by our fate, Rendered citizens by thee of late, And endowed with a country and king. VI “Read! Puccini has willed that this sword (Which once made in an ignorant feud Many orphans) remain in our ward Till some patriot its pure civic blood Wipe away in the foe's and make good, In delivering the land by the sword.” VII Then the King exclaimed “This is for me!” And he dashed out his hand on the hilt, While his blue eye shot fire openly, And his heart overboiled till it spilt A hot prayer,—“God! the rest as Thou wilt! But grant me this!—This is for me.” VIII O Victor Emanuel, the King, The sword is for thee, and the deed, And nought for the alien, next spring, Nought for Hapsburg and Bourbon agreed— But, for us, a great Italy freed, With a hero to head us,—our King! SUMMING UP IN ITALY. (INSCRIBED TO INTELLIGENT PUBLICS OUT OF IT.) I Observe how it will be at last, When our Italy stands at full stature, A year ago tied down so fast That the cord cut the quick of her nature! You'll honour the deed and its scope, Then, in logical sequence upon it, Will use up the remnants of rope By hanging the men who have done it. II The speech in the Commons, which hits you A sketch off, how dungeons must feel,— The official despatch, which commits you From stamping out groans with your heel,— Suggestions in journal or book for Good efforts,—are praised as is meet: But what in this world can men look for, Who only achieve and complete? III True, you've praise for the fireman who sets his Brave face to the axe of the flame, Disappears in the smoke, and then fetches A babe down, or idiot that's lame,— For the boor even, who rescues through pity A sheep from the brute who would kick it: But saviours of nations!—'tis pretty, And doubtful: they may be so wicked: IV Azeglio, Farini, Mamiani, Ricasoli,—doubt by the dozen!—here's Pepoli too, and Cipriani, Imperial cousins and cozeners— Arese, Laiatico,—courtly Of manners, if stringent of mouth: Garibaldi! we'll come to him shortly (As soon as he ends in the South). V Napoleon—as strong as ten armies, Corrupt as seven devils—a fact You accede to, then seek where the harm is Drained off from the man to his act, And find—a free nation! Suppose Some hell-brood in Eden's sweet greenery, Convoked for creating—a rose! Would it suit the infernal machinery? VI Cavour,—to the despot's desire, Who his own thought so craftily marries— What is he but just a thin wire For conducting the lightning from Paris? Yes, write down the two as compeers, Confessing (you would not permit a lie) He bore up his Piedmont ten years Till she suddenly smiled and was Italy. VII And the King, with that “stain on his scutcheon,” Blue Book: Diplomatical Correspondence. Savoy—as the calumny runs; (If it be not his blood,—with his clutch on The sword, and his face to the guns.) O first, where the battle-storm gathers, O loyal of heart on the throne, Let those keep the “graves of their fathers” Who quail, in a nerve, from their own! VIII For thee—through the dim Hades-portal The dream of a voice—“Blessed thou Who hast made all thy race twice immortal! No need of the sepulchres now! —Left to Bourbons and Hapsburgs, who fester Above-ground with worm-eaten souls, While the ghost of some pale feudal jester Before them strews treaties in holes.” IX But hush!—am I dreaming a poem Of Hades, Heaven, Justice? Not I; I began too far off, in my proem, With what men believe and deny: And on earth, whatsoever the need is (To sum up as thoughtful reviewers), The moral of every great deed is— The virtue of slandering the doers. “DIED . . .” (The “Times” Obituary.) I What shall we add now? He is dead. And I who praise and you who blame, With wash of words across his name, Find suddenly declared instead— “On Sunday, third of August, dead.” II Which stops the whole we talked to-day. I, quickened to a plausive glance At his large general tolerance By common people's narrow way, Stopped short in praising. Dead, they say. III And you, who had just put in a sort Of cold deduction—“rather, large Through weakness of the continent marge, Than greatness of the thing contained”— Broke off. Dead!—there, you stood restrained. IV As if we had talked in following one Up some long gallery. “Would you choose An air like that? The gait is loose— Or noble.” Sudden in the sun An oubliette winks. Where is he? Gone. V Dead. Man's “I was” by God's “I am”— All hero-worship comes to that. High heart, high thought, high fame, as flat As a gravestone. Bring your Jacet jam— The epitaph's an epigram. VI Dead. There's an answer to arrest All carping. Dust's his natural place? He'll let the flies buzz round his face And, though you slander, not protest? —From such an one, exact the Best? VII Opinions gold or brass are null. We chuck our flattery or abuse, Called Cæsar's due, as Charon's dues, I' the teeth of some dead sage or fool, To mend the grinning of a skull. VIII Be abstinent in praise and blame. The man's still mortal, who stands first, And mortal only, if last and worst. Then slowly lift so frail a fame, Or softly drop so poor a shame. THE FORCED RECRUIT. (Solferino, 1859.) I In the ranks of the Austrian you found him, He died with his face to you all; Yet bury him here where around him You honour your bravest that fall. II Venetian, fair-featured and slender, He lies shot to death in his youth, With a smile on his lips over-tender For any mere soldier's dead mouth. III No stranger, and yet not a traitor, Though alien the cloth on his breast, Underneath it how seldom a greater Young heart has a shot sent to rest! IV By your enemy tortured and goaded To march with them, stand in their file, His musket (see) never was loaded, He facing your guns with that smile! V As orphans yearn on to their mothers, He yearned to your patriot bands;— “Let me die for our Italy, brothers, If not in your ranks, by your hands! VI “Aim straightly, fire steadily! spare me A ball in the body which may Deliver my heart here, and tear me This badge of the Austrian away!” VII So thought he, so died he this morning. What then? many others have died. Ay, but easy for men to die scorning The death-stroke, who fought side by side— VIII One tricolor floating above them; Struck down 'mid triumphant acclaims Of an Italy rescued to love them And blazon the brass with their names. IX But he,—without witness or honour, Mixed, shamed in his country's regard, With the tyrants who march in upon her, Died faithful and passive: 'twas hard. X 'Twas sublime. In a cruel restriction Cut off from the guerdon of sons, With most filial obedience, conviction, His soul kissed the lips of her guns. XI That moves you? Nay, grudge not to show it, While digging a grave for him here: The others who died, says your poet, Have glory,—let him have a tear. GARIBALDI. I He bent his head upon his breast Wherein his lion-heart lay sick:— “Perhaps we are not ill-repaid; Perhaps this is not a true test; Perhaps this was not a foul trick; Perhaps none wronged, and none betrayed. II “Perhaps the people's vote which here United, there may disunite, And both be lawful as they think; Perhaps a patriot statesman, dear For chartering nations, can with right Disfranchise those who hold the ink. III “Perhaps men's wisdom is not craft; Men's greatness, not a selfish greed; Men's justice, not the safer side; Perhaps even women, when they laughed, Wept, thanked us that the land was freed, Not wholly (though they kissed us) lied. IV “Perhaps no more than this we meant, When up at Austria's guns we flew, And quenched them with a cry apiece, Italia!—Yet a dream was sent . . . The little house my father knew, The olives and the palms of Nice.” V He paused, and drew his sword out slow, Then pored upon the blade intent, As if to read some written thing; While many murmured,—“He will go In that despairing sentiment And break his sword before the King.” VI He poring still upon the blade, His large lid quivered, something fell. “Perhaps,” he said, “I was not born With such fine brains to treat and trade,— And if a woman knew it well, Her falsehood only meant her scorn. VII “Yet through Varese's cannon-smoke My eye saw clear: men feared this man At Como, where this sword could seal Death's protocol with every stroke: And now . . . the drop there scarcely can Impair the keenness of the steel. VIII “So man and sword may have their use; And if the soil beneath my foot In valour's act is forfeited, I'll strike the harder, take my dues Out nobler, and all loss confute From ampler heavens above my head. IX “My King, King Victor, I am thine! So much Nice-dust as what I am (To make our Italy) must cleave. Forgive that.” Forward with a sign He went. You've seen the telegram? Palermo's taken, we believe. ONLY A CURL. I Friends of faces unknown and a land Unvisited over the sea, Who tell me how lonely you stand With a single gold curl in the hand Held up to be looked at by me,— II While you ask me to ponder and say What a father and mother can do, With the bright fellow-locks put away Out of reach, beyond kiss, in the clay Where the violets press nearer than you: III Shall I speak like a poet, or run Into weak woman's tears for relief? Oh, children!—I never lost one,— Yet my arm's round my own little son, And Love knows the secret of Grief. IV And I feel what it must be and is, When God draws a new angel so Through the house of a man up to His, With a murmur of music you miss, And a rapture of light you forgo. V How you think, staring on at the door, Where the face of your angel flashed in, That its brightness, familiar before, Burns off from you ever the more For the dark of your sorrow and sin. VI “God lent him and takes him,” you sigh; —Nay, there let me break with your pain: God's generous in giving, say I,— And the thing which He gives, I deny That He ever can take back again. VII He gives what He gives. I appeal To all who bear babes—in the hour When the veil of the body we feel Rent round us,—while torments reveal The motherhood's advent in power, VIII And the babe cries!—has each of us known By apocalypse (God being there Full in nature) the child is our own, Life of life, love of love, moan of moan, Through all changes, all times, everywhere. IX He's ours and for ever. Believe, O father!—O mother, look back To the first love's assurance! To give Means with God not to tempt or deceive With a cup thrust in Benjamin's sack. X He gives what He gives. Be content! He resumes nothing given,—be sure! God lend? Where the usurers lent In His temple, indignant He went And scourged away all those impure. XI He lends not; but gives to the end, As He loves to the end. If it seem That He draws back a gift, comprehend 'Tis to add to it rather,—amend, And finish it up to your dream,— XII Or keep,—as a mother will toys Too costly, though given by herself, Till the room shall be stiller from noise, And the children more fit for such joys, Kept over their heads on the shelf. XIII So look up, friends! you, who indeed Have possessed in your house a sweet piece Of the Heaven which men strive for, must need Be more earnest than others are,—speed Where they loiter, persist where they cease. XIV You know how one angel smiles there: Then weep not. 'Tis easy for you To be drawn by a single gold hair Of that curl, from earth's storm and despair, To the safe place above us. Adieu. A VIEW AGROSS THE ROMAN CAMPAGNA. (1861.) I Over the dumb Campagna-sea, Out in the offing through mist and rain, Saint Peter's Church heaves silently Like a mighty ship in pain, Facing the tempest with struggle and strain. II Motionless waifs of ruined towers, Soundless breakers of desolate land: The sullen surf of the mist devours That mountain-range upon either hand, Eaten away from its outline grand. III And over the dumb Campagna-sea Where the ship of the Church heaves on to wreck, Alone and silent as God must be, The Christ walks. Ay, but Peter's neck Is stiff to turn on the foundering deck. IV Peter, Peter! if such be thy name, Now leave the ship for another to steer, And proving thy faith evermore the same, Come forth, tread out through the dark and drear, Since He who walks on the sea is here. V Peter, Peter! He does not speak; He is not as rash as in old Galilee: Safer a ship, though it toss and leak, Than a reeling foot on a rolling sea! And he's got to be round in the girth, thinks he. VI Peter, Peter! He does not stir; His nets are heavy with silver fish; He reckons his gains, and is keen to infer —“The broil on the shore, if the Lord should wish; But the sturgeon goes to the Cæsar's dish.” VII Peter, Peter! thou fisher of men, Fisher of fish wouldst thou live instead? Haggling for pence with the other Ten, Cheating the market at so much a head, Griping the Bag of the traitor Dead? VIII At the triple crow of the Gallic cock Thou weep'st not, thou, though thine eyes be dazed: What bird comes next in the tempest shock? —Vultures! see,—as when Romulus gazed,— To inaugurate Rome for a world amazed! THE KING'S GIFT. I Teresa, ah, Teresita! Now what has the messenger brought her, Our Garibaldi's young daughter, To make her stop short in her singing? Will she not once more repeat a Verse from that hymn of our hero's, Setting the souls of us ringing? Break off the song where the tear rose? Ah, Teresita! II A young thing, mark, is Teresa: Her eyes have caught fire, to be sure, in That necklace of jewels from Turin, Till blind their regard to us men is. But still she remembers to raise a Sly look to her father, and note— “Could she sing on as well about Venice, Yet wear such a flame at her throat? Decide for Teresa.” III Teresa, ah, Teresita! His right hand has paused on her head— “Accept it, my daughter,” he said; “Ay, wear it, true child of thy mother! Then sing, till all start to their feet, a New verse ever bolder and freer! King Victor's no king like another, But verily noble as we are, Child, Teresita!” PARTING LOVERS. (Siena, 1860.) I I love thee, love thee, Giulio; Some call me cold, and some demure; And if thou hast ever guessed that so I loved thee . . . well, the proof was poor And no one could be sure. II Before thy song (with shifted rhymes To suit my name) did I undo The persian? If it stirred sometimes, Thou has not seen a hand push through A foolish flower or two. III My mother listening to my sleep, Heard nothing but a sigh at night,— The short sigh rippling on the deep, When hearts run out of breath and sight Of men, to God's clear light. IV When others named thee,—thought thy brows Were straight, thy smile was tender—“Here He comes between the vineyard-rows!” I said not “Ay,” nor waited, Dear, To feel thee step too near. V I left such things to bolder girls,— Olivia or Clotilda. Nay, When that Clotilda, through her curls, Held both thine eyes in hers one day, I marvelled, let me say. VI I could not try the woman's trick: Between us straightway fell the blush Which kept me separate, blind and sick. A wind came with thee in a flush, As blown through Sinai's bush. VII But now that Italy invokes Her young men to go forth and chase The foe or perish,—nothing chokes My voice, or drives me from the place. I look thee in the face. VIII I love thee! It is understood, Confest: I do not shrink or start. No blushes! all my body's blood Has gone to greaten this poor heart. That, loving, we may part. IX Our Italy invokes the youth To die if need be. Still there's room, Though earth is strained with dead in truth: Since twice the lilies were in bloom They have not grudged a tomb. X And many a plighted maid and wife And mother, who can say since then “My country,”—cannot say through life “My son,” “my spouse,” “my flower of men,” And not weep dumb again. XI Heroic males the country bears,— But daughters give up more than sons: Flags wave, drums beat, and unawares You flash your souls out with the guns, And take your Heaven at once. XII But we!—we empty heart and home Of life's life, love! We bear to think You're gone,—to feel you may not come,— To hear the door-latch stir and clink, Yet no more you! . . . nor sink. XIII Dear God! when Italy is one, Complete, content from bound to bound, Suppose, for my share, earth's undone By one grave in't!—as one small wound Will kill a man, 'tis found. XIV What then? If love's delight must end, At least we'll clear its truth from flaws. I love thee, love thee, sweetest friend! Now take my sweetest without pause, And help the nation's cause. XV And thus, of noble Italy We'll both be worthy! Let her show The future how we made her free, Not sparing life . . . nor Giulio, Nor this . . . this heartbreak! Go. MOTHER AND POET. (Turin, after news from Gaeta, 1861.) I Dead! One of them shot by the sea in the east, And one of them shot in the west by the sea. Dead! both my boys! When you sit at the feast And are wanting a great song for Italy free, Let none look at me! II Yet I was a poetess only last year, And good at my art, for a woman, men said; But this woman, this, who is agonised here, —The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head For ever instead. III What art can a woman be good at? Oh, vain! What art is she good at, but hurting her breast With the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain? Ah boys, how you hurt! you were strong as you pressed, And I proud, by that test. IV What art's for a woman? To hold on her knees Both darlings! to feel all their arms round her throat, Cling, strangle a little! to sew by degrees And 'broider the long-clothes and neat little coat; To dream and to doat. V To teach them . . . It stings there! I made them indeed Speak plain the word country. I taught them, no doubt, That a country's a thing men should die for at need. I prated of liberty, rights, and about The tyrant cast out. VI And when their eyes flashed . . . O my beautiful eyes! . . . I exulted; nay, let them go forth at the wheels Of the guns, and denied not. But then the surprise When one sits quite alone! Then one weeps, then one kneels! God, how the house feels! VII At first, happy news came, in gay letters moiled With my kisses,—of camp-life and glory, and how They both loved me; and, soon coming home to be spoiled In return would fan off every fly from my brow With their green laurel-bough. VIII Then was triumph at Turin: “Ancona was free!” And some one came out of the cheers in the street, With a face pale as stone, to say something to me. My Guido was dead! I fell down at his feet, While they cheered in the street. IX I bore it; friends soothed me; my grief looked sublime As the ransom of Italy. One boy remained To be leant on and walked with, recalling the time When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained To the height he had gained. X And letters still came, shorter, sadder, more strong, Writ now but in one hand, “I was not to faint,— One loved me for two—would be with me ere long: And Vina l' italia!—he died for, our saint, Who forbids our complaint.” XI My Nanni would add, “he was safe, and aware Of a presence that turned off the balls,—was imprest It was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear, And how 'twas impossible, quite dispossessed To live on for the rest.” XII On which, without pause, up the telegraph-line Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta:—Shot. Tell his mother. Ah, ah, “his,” “their” mother,—not “mine,” No voice says “My mother” again to me. What! You think Guido forgot? XIII Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven, They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe? I think not. Themselves were too lately forgiven Through That Love and Sorrow which reconciled so The Above and Below. XIV O Christ of the five wounds, who look'dst through the dark To the face of Thy mother! consider, I pray, How we common mothers stand desolate, mark, Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away, And no last word to say! XV Both boys dead? but that's out of nature. We all Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one. 'Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to a wall; And, when Italy's made, for what end is it done If we have not a son? XVI Ah, ah, ah! when Gaeta's taken, what then? When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sport Of the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men? When the guns of Cavalli with final retort Have cut the game short? XVII When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee, When your flag takes all heaven for its white, green, and red, When you have your country from mountain to sea, When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head, (And I have my Dead)— XVIII What then? Do not mock me. Ah, ring your bells low, And burn your lights faintly! My country is there, Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow: My Italy's there, with my brave civic Pair, To disfranchise despair! XIX Forgive me. Some women bear children in strength, And bite back the cry of their pain in self-scorn; But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at length Into wail such as this—and we sit on forlorn When the man-child is born. XX Dead! One of them shot by the sea in the east, And one of them shot in the west by the sea. Both! both my boys! If in keeping the feast You want a great song for your Italy free, Let none look at me! [This was Laura Savio, of Turin, a poetess and patriot, whose sons were killed at Ancona and Gaeta.] NATURE'S REMORSES. (Rome, 1861.) I Her soul was bred by a throne, and fed From the sucking-bottle used in her race On starch and water (for mother's milk Which gives a larger growth instead), And, out of the natural liberal grace, Was swaddled away in violet silk. II And young and kind, and royally blind, Forth she stepped from her palace-door On three-piled carpet of compliments, Curtains of incense drawn by the wind In between her for evermore And daylight issues of events. III On she drew, as a queen might do, To meet a Dream of Italy,— Of magical town and musical wave, Where even a god, his amulet blue Of shining sea, in an ecstasy Dropt and forgot in a Nereid's cave. IV Down she goes, as the soft wind blows, To live more smoothly than mortals can, To love and to reign as queen and wife, To wear a crown that smells of a rose, And still, with a sceptre as light as a fan, Beat sweet time to the song of life. V What is this? As quick as a kiss Falls the smile from her girlish mouth! The lion-people has left its lair, Roaring along her garden of bliss, And the fiery underworld of the South Scorched a way to the upper air. VI And a fire-stone ran in the form of a man, Burningly, boundingly, fatal and fell, Bowling the kingdom down! Where was the King? She had heard somewhat, since life began, Of terrors on earth and horrors in hell, But never, never of such a thing. VII You think she dropped when her dream was stopped, When the blotch of Bourbon blood inlay, Lividly rank, her new lord's cheek? Not so. Her high heart overtopped The royal part she had come to play. Only the men in that hour were weak. VIII And twice a wife by her ravaged life, And twice a queen by her kingdom lost, She braved the shock and the counter-shock Of hero and traitor, bullet and knife, While Italy pushed, like a vengeful ghost, That son of the Cursed from Gaeta's rock. IX What will ye give her, who could not deliver, German Princesses? A laurel-wreath All over-scored with your signatures, Graces, Serenities, Highnesses ever? Mock her not, fresh from the truth of Death, Conscious of dignities higher than yours. X What will ye put in your casket shut, Ladies of Paris, in sympathy's name? Guizot's daughter, what have you brought her? Withered immortelles, long ago cut For guilty dynasties perished in shame, Putrid to memory, Guizot's daughter? XI Ah poor queen! so young and serene! What shall we do for her, now hope's done, Standing at Rome in these ruins old, She too a ruin and no more a queen? Leave her that diadem made by the sun Turning her hair to an innocent gold. XII Ay! bring close to her, as 'twere a rose, to her, Yon free child from an Apennine city Singing for Italy,—dumb in the place! Something like solace, let us suppose, to her Given, in that homage of wonder and pity, By his pure eyes to her beautiful face. XIII Nature, excluded, savagely brooded; Ruined all queendom and dogmas of state: Then, in reaction remorseful and mild, Rescues the womanhood, nearly eluded, Shows her what's sweetest in womanly fate— Sunshine from Heaven, and the eyes of a child. THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH. THE LAST POEM. (Rome, May 1861.) I. “Now give us lands where the olives grow,” Cried the North to the South, “Where the sun with a golden mouth can blow Blue bubbles of grapes down a vineyard-row!” Cried the North to the South. “Now give us men from the sunless plain,” Cried the South to the North, “By need of work in the snow and the rain, Made strong, and brave by familiar pain!” Cried the South to the North. II. “Give lucider hills and intenser seas,” Said the North to the South, “Since ever by symbols and bright degrees Art, childlike, climbs to the dear Lord's knees,” Said the North to the South. “Give strenuous souls for belief and prayer,” Said the South to the North, “That stand in the dark on the lowest stair, While affirming of God, ‘He is certainly there,’” Said the South to the North. III. “Yet oh for the skies that are softer and higher!” Sighed the North to the South; “For the flowers that blaze, and the trees that aspire, And the insects made of a song or a fire!” Sighed the North to the South. “And oh for a seer to discern the same!” Sighed the South to the North; “For a poet's tongue of baptismal flame, To call the tree or the flower by its name!” Sighed the South to the North; IV. The North sent therefore a man of men As a grace to the South; And thus to Rome came Andersen. —“Alas, but must you take him again?” Said the South to the North.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATIONS. PROMETHEUS BOUND. FROM THE GREEK OF ÆSCHYLUS. PERSONS. Prometheus. Oceanus. Hermes. Hephæstus. Io, daughter of Inachus. Strength and Force. Chorus of Sea Nymphs. Scene.—Strength and Force, Hephæstus and Prometheus, at the Rocks. Strength. We reach the utmost limit of the earth, The Scythian track, the desert without man. And now, Hephæstus, thou must needs fulfil The mandate of our Father, and with links Indissoluble of adamantine chains Fasten against this beetling precipice This guilty god. Because he filched away Thine own bright flower, the glory of plastic fire, And gifted mortals with it,—such a sin It doth behove he expiate to the gods, Learning to accept the empery of Zeus And leave off his old trick of loving man. Hephæstus. O Strength and Force, for you, our Zeus's will Presents a deed for doing, no more!—but I, I lack your daring, up this storm-rent chasm To fix with violent hands a kindred god, Howbeit necessity compels me so That I must dare it, and our Zeus commands With a most inevitable word. Ho, thou! High-thoughted son of Themis who is sage! Thee loth, I loth must rivet fast in chains Against this rocky height unclomb by man, Where never human voice nor face shall find Out thee who lov'st them, and thy beauty's flower, Scorched in the sun's clear heat, shall fade away. Night shall come up with garniture of stars To comfort thee with shadow, and the sun Disperse with retrickt beams the morning-frosts, But through all changes sense of present woe Shall vex thee sore, because with none of them There comes a hand to free. Such fruit is plucked From love of man! and in that thou, a god, Didst brave the wrath of gods and give away Undue respect to mortals, for that crime Thou art adjudged to guard this joyless rock, Erect, unslumbering, bending not the knee, And many a cry and unavailing moan To utter on the air. For Zeus is stern, And new-made kings are cruel. Strength. Be it so. Why loiter in vain pity? Why not hate A god the gods hate? one too who betrayed Thy glory unto men? Hephæstus. An awful thing Is kinship joined to friendship. Strength. Grant it be; Is disobedience to the Father's word A possible thing? Dost quail not more for that? Hephæstus. Thou, at least, art a stern one: ever bold. Strength. Why, if I wept, it were no remedy; And do not thou spend labour on the air To bootless uses. Hephæstus. Cursed handicraft! I curse and hate thee, O my craft! Strength. Why hate Thy craft most plainly innocent of all These pending ills? Hephæstus. I would some other hand Were here to work it! Strength. All work hath its pain, Except to rule the gods. There is none free Except King Zeus. Hephæstus. I know it very well: I argue not against it. Strength. Why not, then, Make haste and lock the fetters over him Lest Zeus behold thee lagging? Hephæstus. Here be chains. Zeus may behold these. Strength. Seize him: strike amain: Strike with the hammer on each side his hands— Rivet him to the rock. Hephæstus. The work is done, And thoroughly done. Strength. Still faster grapple him; Wedge him in deeper: leave no inch to stir. He's terrible for finding a way out From the irremediable. Hephæstus. Here's an arm, at least, Grappled past freeing. Strength. Now then, buckle me The other securely. Let this wise one learn He's duller than our Zeus. Hephæstus. Oh, none but he Accuse me justly. Strength. Now, straight through the chest, Take him and bite him with the clenching tooth Of the adamantine wedge, and rivet him. Hephæstus. Alas, Prometheus, what thou sufferest here I sorrow over. Strength. Dost thou flinch again And breathe groans for the enemies of Zeus? Beware lest thine own pity find thee out. Hephæstus. Thou dost behold a spectacle that turns The sight o' the eyes to pity. Strength. I behold A sinner suffer his sin's penalty. But lash the thongs about his sides. Hephæstus. So much, I must do. Urge no farther than I must. Strength. Ay, but I will urge!—and, with shout on shout, Will hound thee at this quarry. Get thee down And ring amain the iron round his legs. Hephæstus. That work was not long doing. Strength. Heavily now Let fall the strokes upon the perforant gyves: For He who rates the work has a heavy hand. Hephæstus. Thy speech is savage as thy shape. Strength. Be thou Gentle and tender! but revile not me For the firm will and the untruckling hate. Hephæstus. Let us go. He is netted round with chains. Strength. Here, now, taunt on! and having spoiled the gods Of honours, crown withal thy mortal men Who live a whole day out. Why how could they Draw off from thee one single of thy griefs? Methinks the Dæmons gave thee a wrong name, “Prometheus,” which means Providence,—because Thou dost thyself need providence to see Thy roll and ruin from the top of doom. Prometheus (alone). O holy Æther, and swift-wingèd Winds, And River-wells, and laughter innumerous Of yon sea-waves! Earth, mother of us all, And all-viewing cyclic Sun, I cry on you,— Behold me, a god, what I endure from gods! Behold, with throe on throe, How, wasted by this woe, I wrestle down the myriad years of time! Behold, how fast around me, The new King of the happy ones sublime Has flung the chain he forged, has shamed and bound me! Woe, woe! to-day's woe and the coming morrow's I cover with one groan. And where is found me A limit to these sorrows? And yet what word do I say? I have foreknown Clearly all things that should be; nothing done Comes sudden to my soul; and I must bear What is ordained with patience, being aware Necessity doth front the universe With an invincible gesture. Yet this curse Which strikes me now, I find it hard to brave In silence or in speech. Because I gave Honour to mortals, I have yoked my soul To this compelling fate. Because I stole The secret fount of fire, whose bubbles went Over the ferule's brim, and manward sent Art's mighty means and perfect rudiment, That sin I expiate in this agony, Hung here in fetters, 'neath the blanching sky. Ah, ah me! what a sound, What a fragrance sweeps up from a pinion unseen Of a god, or a mortal, or nature between, Sweeping up to this rock where the earth has her bound, To have sight of my pangs or some guerdon obtain. Lo, a god in the anguish, a god in the chain! The god, Zeus hateth sore And his gods hate again, As many as tread on his glorified floor, Because I loved mortals too much evermore. Alas me! what a murmur and motion I hear, As of birds flying near! And the air undersings The light stroke of their wings— And all life that approaches I wait for in fear. Chorus of Sea Nymphs, 1st Strophe. Fear nothing! our troop Floats lovingly up With a quick-oaring stroke Of wings steered to the rock, Having softened the soul of our father below. For the gales of swift-bearing have sent me a sound, And the clank of the iron, the malleted blow, Smote down the profound Of my caverns of old, And struck the red light in a blush from my brow,— Till I sprang up unsandaled, in haste to behold, And rushed forth on my chariot of wings manifold. Prometheus. Alas me!—alas me! Ye offspring of Tethys who bore at her breast Many children, and eke of Oceanus, he Coiling still around earth with perpetual unrest! Behold me and see How transfixed with the fang Of a fetter I hang On the high-jutting rocks of this fissure and keep An uncoveted watch o'er the world and the deep. Chorus, 1st Antistrophe. I behold thee, Prometheus; yet now, yet now, A terrible cloud whose rain is tears Sweeps over mine eyes that witness how Thy body appears Hung awaste on the rocks by infrangible chains: For new is the Hand, new the rudder that steers The ship of Olympus through surge and wind— And of old things passed, no track is behind. Prometheus. Under earth, under Hades Where the home of the shade is, All into the deep, deep Tartarus, I would he had hurled me adown. I would he had plunged me, fastened thus In the knotted chain with the savage clang, All into the dark where there should be none, Neither god nor another, to laugh and see. But now the winds sing through and shake The hurtling chains wherein I hang, And I, in my naked sorrows, make Much mirth for my enemy. Chorus, 2nd Strophe. Nay! who of the gods hath a heart so stern As to use thy woe for a mock and mirth? Who would not turn more mild to learn Thy sorrows? who of the heaven and earth Save Zeus? But he Right wrathfully Bears on his sceptral soul unbent And rules thereby the heavenly seed, Nor will he pause till he content His thirsty heart in a finished deed; Or till Another shall appear, To win by fraud, to seize by fear The hard-to-be-captured government. Prometheus. Yet even of me he shall have need, That monarch of the blessed seed, Of me, of me, who now am cursed By his fetters dire,— To wring my secret out withal And learn by whom his sceptre shall Be filched from him—as was, at first, His heavenly fire. But he never shall enchant me With his honey-lipped persuasion; Never, never shall he daunt me With the oath and threat of passion Into speaking as they want me, Till he loose this savage chain, And accept the expiation Of my sorrow, in his pain. Chorus, 2nd Antistrophe. Thou art, sooth, a brave god, And, for all thou hast borne From the stroke of the rod, Nought relaxest from scorn. But thou speakest unto me Too free and unworn; And a terror strikes through me And festers my soul And I fear, in the roll Of the storm, for thy fate In the ship far from shore: Since the son of Saturnus is hard in his hate And unmoved in his heart evermore. Prometheus. I know that Zeus is stern; I know he metes his justice by his will; And yet, his soul shall learn More softness when once broken by this ill: And curbing his unconquerable vaunt He shall rush on in fear to meet with me Who rush to meet with him in agony, To issues of harmonious covenant. Chorus. Remove the veil from all things and relate The story to us,—of what crime accused, Zeus smites thee with dishonourable pangs. Speak: if to teach us do not grieve thyself. Prometheus. The utterance of these things is torture to me, But so, too, is their silence; each way lies Woe strong as fate. When gods began with wrath, And war rose up between their starry brows, Some choosing to cast Chronos from his throne That Zeus might king it there, and some in haste With opposite oaths that they would have no Zeus To rule the gods for ever,—I, who brought The counsel I thought meetest, could not move The Titans, children of the Heaven and Earth, What time, disdaining in their rugged souls My subtle machinations, they assumed It was an easy thing for force to take The mastery of fate. My mother, then, Who is called not only Themis but Earth too, (Her single beauty joys in many names) Did teach me with reiterant prophecy What future should be, and how conquering gods Should not prevail by strength and violence But by guile only. When I told them so, They would not deign to contemplate the truth On all sides round; whereat I deemed it best To lead my willing mother upwardly And set my Themis face to face with Zeus As willing to receive her. Tartarus, With its abysmal cloister of the Dark, Because I gave that counsel, covers up The antique Chronos and his siding hosts, And, by that counsel helped, the king of gods Hath recompensed me with these bitter pangs: For kingship wears a cancer at the heart,— Distrust in friendship. Do ye also ask What crime it is for which he tortures me? That shall be clear before you. When at first He filled his father's throne, he instantly Made various gifts of glory to the gods And dealt the empire out. Alone of men, Of miserable men, he took no count, But yearned to sweep their track off from the world And plant a newer race there. Not a god Resisted such desire except myself. I dared it! I drew mortals back to light, From meditated ruin deep as hell! For which wrong, I am bent down in these pangs Dreadful to suffer, mournful to behold, And I, who pitied man, am thought myself Unworthy of pity; while I render out Deep rhythms of anguish 'neath the harping hand That strikes me thus—a sight to shame your Zeus! Chorus. Hard as thy chains and cold as all these rocks Is he, Prometheus, who withholds his heart From joining in thy woe. I yearned before To fly this sight; and, now I gaze on it, I sicken inwards. Prometheus. To my friends, indeed, I must be a sad sight. Chorus. And didst thou sin No more than so? Prometheus. I did restrain besides My mortals from premeditating death. Chorus. How didst thou medicine the plague-fear of death? Prometheus. I set blind Hopes to inhabit in their house. Chorus. By that gift thou didst help thy mortals well. Prometheus. I gave them also fire. Chorus. And have they now, Those creatures of a day, the red-eyed fire? Prometheus. They have: and shall learn by it many arts. Chorus. And truly for such sins Zeus tortures thee And will remit no anguish? Is there set No limit before thee to thine agony? Prometheus. No other: only what seems good to him. Chorus. And how will it seem good? what hope remains? Seest thou not that thou hast sinned? But that thou hast sinned It glads me not to speak of, and grieves thee: Then let it pass from both, and seek thyself Some outlet from distress. Prometheus. It is in truth An easy thing to stand aloof from pain And lavish exhortation and advice On one vexed sorely by it. I have known All in prevision. By my choice, my choice, I freely sinned—I will confess my sin— And helping mortals, found my own despair. I did not think indeed that I should pine Beneath such pangs against such skyey rocks, Doomed to this drear hill and no neighbouring Of any life: but mourn not ye for griefs I bear to-day: hear rather, dropping down To the plain, how other woes creep on to me, And learn the consummation of my doom. Beseech you, nymphs, beseech you, grieve for me Who now am grieving; for Grief walks the earth, And sits down at the foot of each by turns. Chorus. We hear the deep clash of thy words, Prometheus, and obey. And I spring with a rapid foot away From the rushing car and the holy air, The track of birds; And I drop to the rugged ground and there Await the tale of thy despair. Oceanus enters. Oceanus. I reach the bourn of my weary road, Where I may see and answer thee, Prometheus, in thine agony. On the back of the quick-winged bird I glode, And I bridled him in With the will of a god. Behold, thy sorrow aches in me Constrained by the force of kin. Nay, though that tie were all undone, For the life of none beneath the sun Would I seek a larger benison Than I seek for thine. And thou shalt learn my words are truth,— That no fair parlance of the mouth Grows falsely out of mine. Now give me a deed to prove my faith; For no faster friend is named in breath Than I, Oceanus, am thine. Prometheus. Ha! what has brought thee? Hast thou also come To look upon my woe? How hast thou dared To leave the depths called after thee, the caves Self-hewn and self-roofed with spontaneous rock, To visit earth, the mother of my chain? Hast come indeed to view my doom and mourn That I should sorrow thus? Gaze on, and see How I, the fast friend of your Zeus,—how I The erector of the empire in his hand, Am bent beneath that hand, in this despair. Oceanus. Prometheus, I behold: and I would fain Exhort thee, though already subtle enough, To a better wisdom. Titan, know thyself, And take new softness to thy manners since A new king rules the gods. If words like these, Harsh words and trenchant, thou wilt fling abroad, Zeus haply, though he sit so far and high, May hear thee do it, and so, this wrath of his Which now affects thee fiercely, shall appear A mere child's sport at vengeance. Wretched god, Rather dismiss the passion which thou hast, And seek a change from grief. Perhaps I seem To address thee with old saws and outworn sense,— Yet such a curse, Prometheus, surely waits On lips that speak too proudly: thou, meantime, Art none the meeker, nor dost yield a jot To evil circumstance, preparing still To swell the account of grief with other griefs Than what are borne. Beseech thee, use me then For counsel: do not spurn against the pricks,— Seeing that who reigns, reigns by cruelty Instead of right. And now, I go from hence, And will endeavour if a power of mine Can break thy fetters through. For thee,—be calm, And smooth thy words from passion. Knowest thou not Of perfect knowledge, thou who knowest too much, That where the tongue wags, ruin never lags? Prometheus. I gratulate thee who hast shared and dared All things with me, except their penalty. Enough so! leave these thoughts. It cannot be That thou shouldst move Him. He may not be moved; And thou, beware of sorrow on this road. Oceanus. Ay! ever wiser for another's use Than thine! the event, and not the prophecy, Attests it to me. Yet where now I rush, Thy wisdom hath no power to drag me back; Because I glory, glory, to go hence And win for thee deliverance from thy pangs, As a free gift from Zeus. Prometheus. Why there, again, I give thee gratulation and applause. Thou lackest no goodwill. But, as for deeds, Do nought! 'twere all done vainly; helping nought, Whatever thou wouldst do. Rather take rest And keep thyself from evil. If I grieve, I do not therefore wish to multiply The griefs of others. Verily, not so! For still my brother's doom doth vex my soul,— My brother Atlas, standing in the west, Shouldering the column of the heaven and earth, A difficult burden! I have also seen, And pitied as I saw, the earth-born one, The inhabitant of old Cilician caves, The great war-monster of the hundred heads, (All taken and bowed beneath the violent Hand,) Typhon the fierce, who did resist the gods, And, hissing slaughter from his dreadful jaws, Flash out ferocious glory from his eyes As if to storm the throne of Zeus. Whereat, The sleepless arrow of Zeus flew straight at him, The headlong bolt of thunder breathing flame, And struck him downward from his eminence Of exultation; through the very soul, It struck him, and his strength was withered up To ashes, thunder-blasted. Now he lies A helpless trunk supinely, at full length Beside the strait of ocean, spurred into By roots of Ætna; high upon whose tops Hephæstus sits and strikes the flashing ore. From thence the rivers of fire shall burst away Hereafter, and devour with savage jaws The equal plains of fruitful Sicily, Such passion he shall boil back in hot darts Of an insatiate fury and sough of flame, Fallen Typhon,—howsoever struck and charred By Zeus's bolted thunder. But for thee, Thou art not so unlearned as to need My teaching—let thy knowledge save thyself. I quaff the full cup of a present doom, And wait till Zeus hath quenched his will in wrath. Oceanus. Prometheus, art thou ignorant of this, That words do medicine anger? Prometheus. If the word With seasonable softness touch the soul And, where the parts are ulcerous, sear them not By any rudeness. Oceanus. With a noble aim To dare as nobly—is there harm in that? Dost thou discern it? Teach me. Prometheus. I discern Vain aspiration, unresultive work. Oceanus. Then suffer me to bear the brunt of this! Since it is profitable that one who is wise Should seem not wise at all. Prometheus. And such would seem My very crime. Oceanus. In truth thine argument Sends me back home. Prometheus. Lest any lament for me Should cast thee down to hate. Oceanus. The hate of him Who sits a new king on the absolute throne? Prometheus. Beware of him, lest thine heart grieve by him. Oceanus. Thy doom, Prometheus, be my teacher! Prometheus. Go. Depart—beware—and keep the mind thou hast. Oceanus. Thy words drive after, as I rush before. Lo! my four-footed bird sweeps smooth and wide The flats of air with balanced pinions, glad To bend his knee at home in the ocean-stall. [Oceanus departs. Chorus, 1st Strophe. I moan thy fate, I moan for thee, Prometheus! From my eyes too tender, Drop after drop incessantly The tears of my heart's pity render My cheeks wet from their fountains free; Because that Zeus, the stern and cold, Whose law is taken from his breast, Uplifts his sceptre manifest Over the gods of old. 1st Antistrophe. All the land is moaning With a murmured plaint to-day; All the mortal nations Having habitations In the holy Asia Are a dirge entoning For thine honour and thy brothers', Once majestic beyond others In the old belief,— Now are groaning in the groaning Of thy deep-voiced grief. 2nd Strophe. Mourn the maids inhabitant Of the Colchian land, Who with white, calm bosoms stand In the battle's roar: Mourn the Scythian tribes that haunt The verge of earth, Mæotis' shore. 2nd Antistrophe. Yea! Arabia's battle-crown, And dwellers in the beetling town Mount Caucasus sublimely nears,— An iron squadron, thundering down With the sharp-prowed spears. But one other before, have I seen to remain By invincible pain Bound and vanquished,—one Titan! 'twas Atlas, who bears In a curse from the gods, by that strength of his own Which he evermore wears, The weight of the heaven on his shoulder alone, While he sighs up the stars; And the tides of the ocean wail bursting their bars,— Murmurs still the profound, And black Hades roars up through the chasm of the ground, And the fountains of pure-running rivers moan low In a pathos of woe. Prometheus. Beseech you, think not I am silent thus Through pride or scorn. I only gnaw my heart With meditation, seeing myself so wronged. For see—their honours to these new-made gods, What other gave but I, and dealt them out With distribution? Ay—but here I am dumb! For here, I should repeat your knowledge to you, If I spake aught. List rather to the deeds I did for mortals; how, being fools before, I made them wise and true in aim of soul. And let me tell you—not as taunting men, But teaching you the intention of my gifts, How, first beholding, they beheld in vain, And hearing, heard not, but, like shapes in dreams, Mixed all things wildly down the tedious time, Nor knew to build a house against the sun With wickered sides, nor any woodcraft knew, But lived, like silly ants, beneath the ground In hollow caves unsunned. There, came to them No steadfast sign of winter, nor of spring Flower-perfumed, nor of summer full of fruit, But blindly and lawlessly they did all things, Until I taught them how the stars do rise And set in mystery, and devised for them Number, the inducer of philosophies, The synthesis of Letters, and, beside, The artificer of all things, Memory, That sweet Muse-mother. I was first to yoke The servile beasts in couples, carrying An heirdom of man's burdens on their backs. I joined to chariots, steeds, that love the bit They champat—the chief pomp of golden ease. And none but I originated ships, The seaman's chariots, wandering on the brine With linen wings. And I—oh, miserable!— Who did devise for mortals all these arts, Have no device left now to save myself From the woe I suffer. Chorus. Most unseemly woe Thou sufferest, and dost stagger from the sense Bewildered! like a bad leech falling sick Thou art faint at soul, and canst not find the drugs Required to save thyself. Prometheus. Hearken the rest, And marvel further, what more arts and means I did invent,—this, greatest: if a man Fell sick, there was no cure, nor esculent Nor chrism nor liquid, but for lack of drugs Men pined and wasted, till I showed them all Those mixtures of emollient remedies Whereby they might be rescued from disease. I fixed the various rules of mantic art, Discerned the vision from the common dream, Instructed them in vocal auguries Hard to interpret, and defined as plain The wayside omens,—flights of crook-clawed birds,— Showed which are, by their nature, fortunate, And which not so, and what the food of each, And what the hates, affections, social needs, Of all to one another,—taught what sign Of visceral lightness, coloured to a shade, May charm the genial gods, and what fair spots Commend the lung and liver. Burning so The limbs encased in fat, and the long chine, I led my mortals on to an art abstruse, And cleared their eyes to the image in the fire, Erst filmed in dark. Enough said now of this. For the other helps of man hid underground, The iron and the brass, silver and gold, Can any dare affirm he found them out Before me? none, I know! unless he choose To lie in his vaunt. In one word learn the whole,— That all arts came to mortals from Prometheus. Chorus. Give mortals now no inexpedient help, Neglecting thine own sorrow. I have hope still To see thee, breaking from the fetter here, Stand up as strong as Zeus. Prometheus. This ends not thus, The oracular fate ordains. I must be bowed By infinite woes and pangs, to escape this chain. Necessity is stronger than mine art. Chorus. Who holds the helm of that Necessity? Prometheus. The threefold Fates and the unforgetting Furies. Chorus. Is Zeus less absolute than these are? Prometheus. Yea, And therefore cannot fly what is ordained. Chorus. What is ordained for Zeus, except to be A king for ever? Prometheus. 'Tis too early yet For thee to learn it: ask no more. Chorus. Perhaps Thy secret may be something holy? Prometheus. Turn To another matter: this, it is not time To speak abroad, but utterly to veil In silence. For by that same secret kept, I 'scape this chain's dishonour and its woe. Chorus, 1st Strophe. Never, oh never May Zeus, the all-giver, Wrestle down from his throne In that might of his own To antagonise mine! Nor let me delay As I bend on my way Toward the gods of the shrine Where the altar is full Of the blood of the bull, Near the tossing brine Of Ocean my father. May no sin be sped in the word that is said, But my vow be rather Consummated, Nor evermore fail, nor evermore pine. 1st Antistrophe. 'Tis sweet to have Life lengthened out With hopes proved brave By the very doubt, Till the spirit enfold Those manifest joys which were foretold. But I thrill to behold Thee, victim doomed, By the countless cares And the drear despairs Forever consumed,— And all because thou, who art fearless now Of Zeus above, Didst overflow for mankind below With a free-souled, reverent love. Ah friend, behold and see! What's all the beauty of humanity? Can it be fair? What's all the strength? is it strong? And what hope can they bear, These dying livers—living one day long? Ah, seest thou not, my friend, How feeble and slow And like a dream, doth go This poor blind manhood, drifted from its end? And how no mortal wranglings can confuse The harmony of Zeus? Prometheus, I have learnt these things From the sorrow in thy face. Another song did fold its wings Upon my lips in other days, When round the bath and round the bed The hymeneal chant instead I sang for thee, and smiled,— And thou didst lead, with gifts and vows, Hesione, my father's child, To be thy wedded spouse. Io enters. Io. What land is this? what people is here? And who is he that writhes, I see, In the rock-hung chain? Now what is the crime that hath brought thee to pain? Now what is the land—make answer free— Which I wander through, in my wrong and fear? Ah! ah! ah me! The gad-fly stingeth to agony! O Earth, keep off that phantasm pale Of earth-born Argus!—ah!—I quail When my soul descries That herdsman with the myriad eyes Which seem, as he comes, one crafty eye. Graves hide him not, though he should die, But he doggeth me in my misery From the roots of death, on high—on high— And along the sands of the siding deep, All famine-worn, he follows me, And his waxen reed doth undersound The waters round And giveth a measure that giveth sleep. Woe, woe, woe! Where shall my weary course be done? What wouldst thou with me, Saturn's son? And in what have I sinned, that I should go Thus yoked to grief by thine hand for ever? Ah! ah! dost vex me so That I madden and shiver Stung through with dread? Flash the fire down to burn me! Heave the earth up to cover me! Plunge me in the deep, with the salt waves over me, That the sea-beasts may be fed! O king, do not spurn me In my prayer! For this wandering, everlonger, evermore, Hath overworn me, And I know not on what shore I may rest from my despair. Chorus. Hearest thou what the ox-horned maiden saith? Prometheus. How could I choose but hearken what she saith, The phrensied maiden?—Inachus's child?— Who love-warms Zeus's heart, and now is lashed By Herè's hate along the unending ways? Io. Who taught thee to articulate that name,— My father's? Speak to his child By grief and shame defiled! Who art thou, victim, thou who dost acclaim Mine anguish in true words on the wide air, And callest too by name the curse that came From Herè unaware, To waste and pierce me with its maddening goad? Ah—ah—I leap With the pang of the hungry—I bound on the road— I am driven by my doom— I am overcome By the wrath of an enemy strong and deep! Are any of those who have tasted pain, Alas! as wretched as I? Now tell me plain, doth aught remain For my soul to endure beneath the sky? Is there any help to be holpen by? If knowledge be in thee, let it be said! Cry aloud—cry To the wandering, woeful maid! Prometheus. Whatever thou wouldst learn I will declare,— No riddle upon my lips, but such straight words As friends should use to each other when they talk. Thou seest Prometheus, who gave mortals fire. Io. O common Help of all men, known of all, O miserable Prometheus,—for what cause Dost thou endure thus? Prometheus. I have done with wail For my own griefs, but lately. Io. Wilt thou not Vouchsafe the boon to me? Prometheus. Say what thou wilt, For I vouchsafe all. Io. Speak then, and reveal Who shut thee in this chasm. Prometheus. The will of Zeus, The hand of his Hephæstus. Io. And what crime Dost expiate so? Prometheus. Enough for thee I have told In so much only. Io. Nay, but show besides The limit of my wandering, and the time Which yet is lacking to fulfil my grief. Prometheus. Why, not to know were better than to know For such as thou. Io. Beseech thee, blind me not To that which I must suffer. Prometheus. If I do, The reason is not that I grudge a boon. Io. What reason, then, prevents thy speaking out? Prometheus. No grudging; but a fear to break thine heart. Io. Less care for me, I pray thee. Certainty I count for advantage. Prometheus. Thou wilt have it so, And therefore I must speak. Now hear— Chorus. Not yet. Give half the guerdon my way. Let us learn First, what the curse is that befell the maid,— Her own voice telling her own wasting woes: The sequence of that anguish shall await The teaching of thy lips. Prometheus. It doth behove That thou, Maid Io, shouldst vouchsafe to these The grace they pray,—the more, because they are called Thy father's sisters: since to open out And mourn out grief where it is possible To draw a tear from the audience, is a work That pays its own price well. Io. I cannot choose But trust you, nymphs, and tell you all ye ask, In clear words—though I sob amid my speech In speaking of the storm-curse sent from Zeus, And of my beauty, from what height it took Its swoop on me, poor wretch! left thus deformed And monstrous to your eyes. For evermore Around my virgin-chamber, wandering went The nightly visions which entreated me With syllabled smooth sweetness.—“Blessed maid, Why lengthen out thy maiden hours when fate Permits the noblest spousal in the world? When Zeus burns with the arrow of thy love And fain would touch thy beauty?—Maiden, thou Despise not Zeus! depart to Lerné's mead That's green around thy father's flocks and stalls, Until the passion of the heavenly Eye Be quenched in sight.” Such dreams did all night long Constrain me—me, unhappy!—till I dared To tell my father how they trod the dark With visionary steps. Whereat he sent His frequent heralds to the Pythian fane, And also to Dodona, and inquired How best, by act or speech, to please the gods. The same returning brought back oracles Of doubtful sense, indefinite response, Dark to interpret; but at last there came To Inachus an answer that was clear, Thrown straight as any bolt, and spoken out— This—“he should drive me from my home and land, And bid me wander to the extreme verge Of all the earth—or, if he willed it not, Should have a thunder with a fiery eye Leap straight from Zeus to burn up all his race To the last root of it.” By which Loxian word Subdued, he drove me forth and shut me out, He loth, me loth,—but Zeus's violent bit Compelled him to the deed: when instantly My body and soul were changèd and distraught, And, hornèd as ye see, and spurred along By the fanged insect, with a maniac leap I rushed on to Cenchrea's limpid stream And Lerné's fountain-water. There, the earth-born, The herdsman Argus, most immitigable Of wrath, did find me out, and track me out With countless eyes set staring at my steps: And though an unexpected sudden doom Drew him from life, I, curse-tormented still, Am driven from land to land before the scourge The gods hold o'er me. So thou hast heard the past, And if a bitter future thou canst tell, Speak on. I charge thee, do not flatter me Through pity, with false words; for, in my mind, Deceiving works more shame than torturing doth. Chorus. Ah! silence here! Nevermore, nevermore Would I languish for The stranger's word To thrill in mine ear— Nevermore for the wrong and the woe and the fear So hard to behold, So cruel to bear, Piercing my soul with a double-edged sword Of a sliding cold. Ah Fate! ah me! I shudder to see This wandering maid in her agony. Prometheus. Grief is too quick in thee and fear too full: Be patient till thou hast learnt the rest. Chorus. Speak: teach. To those who are sad already, it seems sweet, By clear foreknowledge to make perfect, pain. Prometheus. The boon ye asked me first was lightly won,— For first ye asked the story of this maid's grief As her own lips might tell it. Now remains To list what other sorrows she so young Must bear from Herè. Inachus's child, O thou! drop down thy soul my weighty words, And measure out the landmarks which are set To end thy wandering. Toward the orient sun First turn thy face from mine and journey on Along the desert flats till thou shalt come Where Scythia's shepherd peoples dwell aloft, Perched in wheeled waggons under woven roofs, And twang the rapid arrow past the bow— Approach them not; but siding in thy course The rugged shore-rocks resonant to the sea, Depart that country. On the left hand dwell The iron-workers, called the Chalybes, Of whom beware, for certes they are uncouth And nowise bland to strangers. Reaching so The stream Hybristes (well the scorner called), Attempt no passage,—it is hard to pass,— Or ere thou come to Caucasus itself, That highest of mountains, where the river leaps The precipice in his strength. Thou must toil up Those mountain-tops that neighbour with the stars, And tread the south way, and draw near, at last, The Amazonian host that hateth man, Inhabitants of Themiscyra, close Upon Thermodon, where the sea's rough jaw Doth gnash at Salmydessa and provide A cruel host to seamen, and to ships A stepdame. They with unreluctant hand Shall lead thee on and on, till thou arrive Just where the ocean-gates show narrowest On the Cimmerian isthmus. Leaving which, Behoves thee swim with fortitude of soul The strait Mæotis. Ay, and evermore That traverse shall be famous on men's lips, That strait, called Bosphorus, the horned-one's road, So named because of thee, who so wilt pass From Europe's plain to Asia's continent. How think ye, nymphs? the king of gods appears Impartial in ferocious deeds? Behold! The god desirous of this mortal's love Hath cursed her with these wanderings. Ah, fair child, Thou hast met a bitter groom for bridal troth! For all thou yet hast heard can only prove The incompleted prelude of thy doom. Io. Ah, ah! Prometheus. Is't thy turn, now, to shriek and moan? How wilt thou, when thou hast hearkened what remains? Chorus. Besides the grief thou hast told can aught remain? Prometheus. A sea—of foredoomed evil worked to storm. Io. What boots my life, then? why not cast myself Down headlong from this miserable rock, That, dashed against the flats, I may redeem My soul from sorrow? Better once to die Than day by day to suffer. Prometheus. Verily, It would be hard for thee to bear my woe For whom it is appointed not to die. Death frees from woe: but I before me see In all my far prevision not a bound To all I suffer, ere that Zeus shall fall From being a king. Io. And can it ever be That Zeus shall fall from empire? Prometheus. Thou, methinks, Wouldst take some joy to see it. Io. Could I choose? I who endure such pangs now, by that god! Prometheus. Learn from me, therefore, that the event shall be. Io. By whom shall his imperial sceptred hand Be emptied so? Prometheus. Himself shall spoil himself, Through his idiotic counsels. Io. How? declare: Unless the word bring evil. Prometheus. He shall wed; And in the marriage-bond be joined to grief. Io. A heavenly bride—or human? Speak it out If it be utterable. Prometheus. Why should I say which? It ought not to be uttered, verily. Io. Then It is his wife shall tear him from his throne? Prometheus. It is his wife shall bear a son to him, More mighty than the father. Io. From this doom Hath he no refuge? Prometheus. None: or ere that I, Loosed from these fetters— Io. Yea—but who shall loose While Zeus is adverse? Prometheus. One who is born of thee: It is ordained so. Io. What is this thou sayest? A son of mine shall liberate thee from woe? Prometheus. After ten generations, count three more, And find him in the third. Io. The oracle Remains obscure. Prometheus. And search it not, to learn Thine own griefs from it. Io. Point me not to a good, To leave me straight bereaved. Prometheus. I am prepared To grant thee one of two things. Io. But which two? Set them before me; grant me power to choose. Prometheus. I grant it; choose now: shall I name aloud What griefs remain to wound thee, or what hand Shall save me out of mine? Chorus. Vouchsafe, O god, The one grace of the twain to her who prays; The next to me; and turn back neither prayer Dishonour'd by denial. To herself Recount the future wandering of her feet; Then point me to the looser of thy chain, Because I yearn to know him. Prometheus. Since ye will, Of absolute will, this knowledge, I will set No contrary against it, nor keep back A word of all ye ask for. Io, first To thee I must relate thy wandering course Far winding. As I tell it, write it down In thy soul's book of memories. When thou hast past The refluent bound that parts two continents, Track on the footsteps of the orient sun In his own fire, across the roar of seas,— Fly till thou hast reached the Gorgonæan flats Beside Cisthené. There, the Phorcides, Three ancient maidens, live, with shape of swan, One tooth between them, and one common eye: On whom the sun doth never look at all With all his rays, nor evermore the moon When she looks through the night. Anear to whom Are the Gorgon sisters three, enclothed with wings, With twisted snakes for ringlets, man-abhorred: There is no mortal gazes in their face And gazing can breathe on. I speak of such To guard thee from their horror. Ay, and list Another tale of a dreadful sight; beware The Griffins, those unbarking dogs of Zeus, Those sharp-mouthed dogs!—and the Arimaspian host Of one-eyed horsemen, habiting beside The river of Pluto that runs bright with gold: Approach them not, beseech thee! Presently Thou'lt come to a distant land, a dusky tribe Of dwellers at the fountain of the Sun, Whence flows the river Æthiops; wind along Its banks and turn off at the cataracts, Just as the Nile pours from the Bybline hills His holy and sweet wave; his course shall guide Thine own to that triangular Nile-ground Where, Io, is ordained for thee and thine A lengthened exile. Have I said in this Aught darkly or incompletely?—now repeat The question, make the knowledge fuller! Lo, I have more leisure than I covet, here. Chorus. If thou canst tell us aught that's left untold, Or loosely told, of her most dreary flight, Declare it straight: but if thou hast uttered all, Grant us that latter grace for which we prayed, Remembering how we prayed it. Prometheus. She has heard The uttermost of her wandering. There it ends. But that she may be certain not to have heard All vainly, I will speak what she endured Ere coming hither, and invoke the past To prove my prescience true. And so—to leave A multitude of words and pass at once To the subject of thy course—when thou hadst gone To those Molossian plains which sweep around Dodona shouldering Heaven, whereby the fane Of Zeus Thesprotian keepeth oracle, And, wonder past belief, where oaks do wave Articulate adjurations—(ay, the same Saluted thee in no perplexèd phrase But clear with glory, noble wife of Zeus That shouldst be,—there some sweetness took thy sense!) Thou didst rush further onward, stung along The ocean-shore, toward Rhea's mighty bay And, tost back from it, wast tost to it again In stormy evolution:—and, know well, In coming time that hollow of the sea Shall bear the name Ionian and present A monument of Io's passage through Unto all mortals. Be these words the signs Of my soul's power to look beyond the veil Of visible things. The rest, to you and her I will declare in common audience, nymphs, Returning thither where my speech brake off. There is a town Canobus, built upon The earth's fair margin at the mouth of Nile And on the mound washed up by it; Io, there Shall Zeus give back to thee thy perfect mind, And only by the pressure and the touch Of a hand not terrible; and thou to Zeus Shalt bear a dusky son who shall be called Thence, Epaphus, Touched. That son shall pluck the fruit Of all that land wide-watered by the flow Of Nile; but after him, when counting out As far as the fifth full generation, then Full fifty maidens, a fair woman-race, Shall back to Argos turn reluctantly, To fly the proffered nuptials of their kin, Their father's brothers. These being passion-struck, Like falcons bearing hard on flying doves, Shall follow, hunting at a quarry of love They should not hunt; till envious Heaven maintain A curse betwixt that beauty and their desire, And Greece receive them, to be overcome In murtherous woman-war, by fierce red hands Kept savage by the night. For every wife Shall slay a husband, dyeing deep in blood The sword of a double edge—(I wish indeed As fair a marriage-joy to all my foes!) One bride alone shall fail to smite to death The head upon her pillow, touched with love, Made impotent of purpose and impelled To choose the lesser evil,—shame on her cheeks, Than blood-guilt on her hands: which bride shall bear A royal race in Argos. Tedious speech Were needed to relate particulars Of these things; 'tis enough that from her seed Shall spring the strong He, famous with the bow, Whose arm shall break my fetters off. Behold, My mother Themis, that old Titaness, Delivered to me such an oracle,— But how and when, I should be long to speak, And thou, in hearing, wouldst not gain at all. Io. Eleleu, eleleu! How the spasm and the pain And the fire on the brain Strike, burning me through! How the sting of the curse, all aflame as it flew, Pricks me onward again! How my heart in its terror is spurning my breast, And my eyes, like the wheels of a chariot, roll round! I am whirled from my course, to the east, to the west, In the whirlwind of phrensy all madly in-wound— And my mouth is unbridled for anguish and hate, And my words beat in vain, in wild storms of unrest, On the sea of my desolate fate. [Io rushes out. Chorus.—Strophe. Oh, wise was he, oh, wise was he Who first within his spirit knew And with his tongue declared it true That love comes best that comes unto The equal of degree! And that the poor and that the low Should seek no love from those above, Whose souls are fluttered with the flow Of airs about their golden height, Or proud because they see arow Ancestral crowns of light. Antistrophe. Oh, never, never may ye, Fates, Behold me with your awful eyes Lift mine too fondly up the skies Where Zeus upon the purple waits! Nor let me step too near—too near To any suitor, bright from heaven: Because I see, because I fear This loveless maiden vexed and lad By this fell curse of Heré, driven On wanderings dread and drear. Epode. Nay, grant an equal troth instead Of nuptial love, to bind me by! It will not hurt, I shall not dread To meet it in reply. But let not love from those above Revert and fix me, as I said, With that inevitable Eye! I have no sword to fight that fight, I have no strength to tread that path, I know not if my nature hath The power to bear, I cannot see Whither from Zeus's infinite I have the power to flee. Prometheus. Yet Zeus, albeit most absolute of will, Shall turn to meekness,—such a marriage-rite He holds in preparation, which anon Shall thrust him headlong from his gerent seat Adown the abysmal void, and so the curse His father Chronos muttered in his fall, As he fell from his ancient throne and cursed, Shall be accomplished wholly. No escape From all that ruin shall the filial Zeus Find granted to him from any of his gods, Unless I teach him. I the refuge know, And I, the means. Now, therefore, let him sit And brave the imminent doom, and fix his faith On his supernal noises, hurtling on With restless hand the bolt that breathes out fire; For these things shall not help him, none of them, Nor hinder his perdition when he falls To shame, and lower than patience: such a foe He doth himself prepare against himself, A wonder of unconquerable hate, An organiser of sublimer fire Than glares in lightnings, and of grander sound Than aught the thunder rolls, out-thundering it, With power to shatter in Poseidon's fist The trident-spear which, while it plagues the sea, Doth shake the shores around it. Ay, and Zeus, Precipitated thus, shall learn at length The difference betwixt rule and servitude. Chorus. Thou makest threats for Zeus of thy desires. Prometheus. I tell you, all these things shall be fulfilled. Even so as I desire them. Chorus. Must we then Look out for one shall come to master Zeus? Prometheus. These chains weigh lighter than his sorrows shall. Chorus. How art thou not afraid to utter such words? Prometheus. What should I fear who cannot die? Chorus. But he Can visit thee with dreader woe than death's. Prometheus. Why, let him do it! I am here, prepared For all things and their pangs. Chorus. The wise are they Who reverence Adrasteia. Prometheus. Reverence thou, Adore thou, flatter thou, whomever reigns, Whenever reigning! but for me, your Zeus Is less than nothing. Let him act and reign His brief hour out according to his will— He will not, therefore, rule the gods too long. But lo! I see that courier-god of Zeus, That new-made menial of the new-crowned king: He doubtless comes to announce to us something new. Hermes enters. Hermes. I speak to thee, the sophist, the talker-down Of scorn by scorn, the sinner against gods, The reverencer of men, the thief of fire,— I speak to thee and adjure thee! Zeus requires Thy declaration of what marriage-rite Thus moves thy vaunt and shall hereafter cause His fall from empire. Do not wrap thy speech In riddles, but speak clearly! Never cast Ambiguous paths, Prometheus, for my feet, Since Zeus, thou mayst perceive, is scarcely won To mercy by such means. Prometheus. A speech well-mouthed In the utterance, and full-minded in the sense, As doth befit a servant of the gods! New gods, ye newly reign, and think forsooth Ye dwell in towers too high for any dart To carry a wound there!—have I not stood by While two kings fell from thence? and shall I not Behold the third, the same who rules you now, Fall, shamed to sudden ruin?—Do I seem To tremble and quail before your modern gods? Far be it from me!—For thyself, depart, Re-tread thy steps in haste. To all thou hast asked I answer nothing. Hermes. Such a wind of pride Impelled thee of yore full-sail upon these rocks. Prometheus. I would not barter—learn thou soothly that!— My suffering for thy service. I maintain It is a nobler thing to serve these rocks Than live a faithful slave to father Zeus. Thus upon scorners I retort their scorn. Hermes. It seems that thou dost glory in thy despair. Prometheus. I glory? would my foes did glory so, And I stood by to see them!—naming whom, Thou are not unremembered. Hermes. Dost thou charge Me also with the blame of thy mischance? Prometheus. I tell thee I loathe the universal gods, Who for the good I gave them rendered back The ill of their injustice. Hermes. Thou art mad— Thou art raving, Titan, at the fever-height. Prometheus. If it be madness to abhor my foes, May I be mad! Hermes. If thou wert prosperous Thou wouldst be unendurable. Prometheus. Alas! Hermes. Zeus knows not that word. Prometheus. But maturing Time Teaches all things. Hermes. Howbeit, thou hast not learnt The wisdom yet, thou needest. Prometheus. If I had, I should not talk thus with a slave like thee. Hermes. No answer thou vouchsafest, I believe, To the great Sire's requirement. Prometheus. Verily I owe him grateful service,—and should pay it. Hermes. Why, thou dost mock me, Titan, as I stood A child before thy face. Prometheus. No child, forsooth, But yet more foolish than a foolish child, If thou expect that I should answer aught Thy Zeus can ask. No torture from his hand Nor any machination in the world Shall force mine utterance ere he loose, himself, These cankerous fetters from me. For the rest, Let him now hurl his blanching lightnings down, And with his white-winged snows and mutterings deep Of subterranean thunders mix all things, Confound them in disorder. None of this Shall bend my sturdy will and make me speak The name of his dethroner who shall come. Hermes. Can this avail thee? Look to it! Prometheus. Long ago It was looked forward to, precounselled of. Hermes. Vain god, take righteous courage! dare for once To apprehend and front thine agonies With a just prudence. Prometheus. Vainly dost thou chafe My soul with exhortation, as yonder sea Goes beating on the rock. Oh, think no more That I, fear-struck by Zeus to a woman's mind, Will supplicate him, loathèd as he is, With feminine upliftings of my hands, To break these chains. Far from me be the thought! Hermes. I have indeed, methinks, said much in vain, For still thy heart beneath my showers of prayers Lies dry and hard—nay, leaps like a young horse Who bites against the new bit in his teeth, And tugs and struggles against the new-tried rein,— Still fiercest in the feeblest thing of all, Which sophism is; since absolute will disjoined From perfect mind is worse than weak. Behold, Unless my words persuade thee, what a blast And whirlwind of inevitable woe Must sweep persuasion through thee! For at first The Father will split up this jut of rock With the great thunder and the bolted flame And hide thy body where a hinge of stone Shall catch it like an arm; and when thou hast passed A long black time within, thou shalt come out To front the sun while Zeus's winged hound, The strong carnivorous eagle, shall wheel down To meet thee, self-called to a daily feast, And set his fierce beak in thee and tear off The long rags of thy flesh and batten deep Upon thy dusky liver. Do not look For any end moreover to this curse Or ere some god appear, to accept thy pangs On his own head vicarious, and descend With unreluctant step the darks of hell And gloomy abysses around Tartarus. Then ponder this—this threat is not a growth Of vain invention; it is spoken and meant; King Zeus's mouth is impotent to lie, Consummating the utterance by the act; So, look to it, thou! take heed, and nevermore Forget good counsel, to indulge self-will. Chorus. Our Hermes suits his reasons to the times; At least I think so, since he bids thee drop Self-will for prudent counsel. Yield to him! When the wise err, their wisdom makes their shame. Prometheus. Unto me the foreknower, this mandate of power He cries, to reveal it. What's strange in my fate, if I suffer from hate At the hour that I feel it? Let the locks of the lightning, all bristling and whitening, Flash, coiling me round, While the æther goes surging 'neath thunder and scourging Of wild winds unbound! Let the blast of the firmament whirl from its place The earth rooted below, And the brine of the ocean, in rapid emotion, Be driven in the face Of the stars up in heaven, as they walk to and fro! Let him hurl me anon into Tartarus—on— To the blackest degree, With Necessity's vortices strangling me down; But he cannot join death to a fate meant for me! Hermes. Why, the words that he speaks and the thoughts that he thinks Are maniacal!—add, If the Fate who hath bound him should loose not the links, He were utterly mad. Then depart ye who groan with him, Leaving to moan with him,— Go in haste! lest the roar of the thunder anearing Should blast you to idiocy, living and hearing. Chorus. Change thy speech for another, thy thought for a new, If to move me and teach me indeed be thy care! For thy words swerve so far from the loyal and true That the thunder of Zeus seems more easy to bear. How! couldst teach me to venture such vileness? behold! I choose, with this victim, this anguish foretold! I recoil from the traitor in hate and disdain, And I know that the curse of the treason is worse Than the pang of the chain. Hermes. Then remember, O nymphs, what I tell you before, Nor, when pierced by the arrows that Até will throw you, Cast blame on your fate and declare evermore That Zeus thrust you on anguish he did not foreshow you. Nay, verily, nay! for ye perish anon For your deed—by your choice. By no blindness of doubt, No abruptness of doom, but by madness alone, In the great net of Até, whence none cometh out, Ye are wound and undone. Prometheus. Ay! in act now, in word now no more, Earth is rocking in space. And the thunders crash up with a roar upon roar, And the eddying lightnings flash fire in my face, And the whirlwinds are whirling the dust round and round, And the blasts of the winds universal leap free And blow each upon each with a passion of sound, And æther goes mingling in storm with the sea. Such a curse on my head, in a manifest dread, From the hand of your Zeus has been hurtled along. O my mother's fair glory! O Æther, enringing All eyes with the sweet common light of thy bringing! Dost see how I suffer this wrong? A LAMENT FOR ADONIS. FROM THE GREEK OF BION. I. I mourn for Adonis—Adonis is dead, Fair Adonis is dead and the Loves are lamenting. Sleep, Cypris, no more on thy purple-strewed bed: Arise, wretch stoled in black; beat thy breast unrelenting, And shriek to the worlds, “Fair Adonis is dead!” II. I mourn for Adonis—the Loves are lamenting. He lies on the hills in his beauty and death; The white tusk of a boar has transpierced his white thigh. Cytherea grows mad at his thin gasping breath, While the black blood drips down on the pale ivory, And his eyeballs lie quenched with the weight of his brows, The rose fades from his lips, and upon them just parted The kiss dies the goddess consents not to lose, Though the kiss of the Dead cannot make her glad-hearted: He knows not who kisses him dead in the dews. III. I mourn for Adonis—the Loves are lamenting. Deep, deep in the thigh is Adonis's wound, But a deeper, is Cypris's bosom presenting. The youth lieth dead while his dogs howl around, And the nymphs weep aloud from the mists of the hill, And the poor Aphrodité, with tresses unbound, All dishevelled, unsandaled, shrieks mournful and shrill Through the dusk of the groves. The thorns, tearing her feet, Gather up the red flower of her blood which is holy, Each footstep she takes; and the valleys repeat The sharp cry she utters and draw it out slowly. She calls on her spouse, her Assyrian, on him Her own youth, while the dark blood spreads over his body, The chest taking hue from the gash in the limb, And the bosom, once ivory, turning to ruddy. IV. Ah, ah, Cytherea! the Loves are lamenting. She lost her fair spouse and so lost her fair smile: When he lived she was fair, by the whole world's consenting, Whose fairness is dead with him: woe worth the while! All the mountains above and the oaklands below Murmur, ah, ah, Adonis! the streams overflow Aphrodité's deep wail; river-fountains in pity Weep soft in the hills, and the flowers as they blow Redden outward with sorrow, while all hear her go With the song of her sadness through mountain and city. V. Ah, ah, Cytherea! Adonis is dead, Fair Adonis is dead—Echo answers, Adonis! Who weeps not for Cypris, when bowing her head She stares at the wound where it gapes and astonies? —When, ah, ah!—she saw how the blood ran away And empurpled the thigh, and, with wild hands flung out, Said with sobs: “Stay, Adonis! unhappy one, stay, Let me feel thee once more, let me ring thee about With the clasp of my arms, and press kiss into kiss! Wait a little, Adonis, and kiss me again, For the last time, beloved,—and but so much of this That the kiss may learn life from the warmth of the strain! —Till thy breath shall exude from thy soul to my mouth, To my heart, and, the love-charm I once more receiving May drink thy love in it and keep of a truth That one kiss in the place of Adonis the living. Thou fliest me, mournful one, fliest me far, My Adonis, and seekest the Acheron portal,— To Hell's cruel King goest down with a scar, While I weep and live on like a wretched immortal, And follow no step! O Persephoné, take him, My husband!—thou'rt better and brighter than I, So all beauty flows down to thee: I cannot make him Look up at my grief; there's despair in my cry, Since I wail for Adonis who died to me—died to me— Then, I fear thee!—Art thou dead, my Adored? Passion ends like a dream in the sleep that's denied to me, Cypris is widowed, the Loves seek their lord All the house through in vain. Charm of cestus has ceased With thy clasp! O too bold in the hunt past preventing, Ay, mad, thou so fair, to have strife with a beast!” Thus the goddess wailed on—and the Loves are lamenting. VI. Ah, ah, Cytherea! Adonis is dead. She wept tear after tear with the blood which was shed, And both turned into flowers for the earth's garden-close, Her tears, to the windflower; his blood, to the rose. VII. I mourn for Adonis—Adonis is dead. Weep no more in the woods, Cytherea, thy lover! So, well: make a place for his corse in thy bed, With the purples thou sleepest in, under and over. He's fair though a corse—a fair corse, like a sleeper. Lay him soft in the silks he had pleasure to fold When, beside thee at night, holy dreams deep and deeper Enclosed his young life on the couch made of gold. Love him still, poor Adonis; cast on him together The crowns and the flowers: since he died from the place, Why, let all die with him; let the blossoms go wither, Rain myrtles and olive-buds down on his face. Rain the myrrh down, let all that is best fall a-pining, Since the myrrh of his life from thy keeping is swept. Pale he lay, thine Adonis, in purples reclining; The Loves raised their voices around him and wept. They have shorn their bright curls off to cast on Adonis; One treads on his bow,—on his arrows, another,— One breaks up a well-feathered quiver, and one is Bent low at a sandal, untying the strings, And one carries the vases of gold from the springs, While one washes the wound,—and behind them a brother Fans down on the body sweet air with his wings. VIII. Cytherea herself now the Loves are lamenting. Each torch at the door Hymenæus blew out; And, the marriage-wreath dropping its leaves as repenting, No more “Hymen, Hymen,” is chanted about, But the ai ai instead—“Ai alas!” is begun For Adonis, and then follows “Ai Hymenæus!” The Graces are weeping for Cinyris' son, Sobbing low each to each, “His fair eyes cannot see us!” Their wail strikes more shrill than the sadder Dioné's. The Fates mourn aloud for Adonis, Adonis, Deep chanting; he hears not a word that they say: He would hear, but Persephoné has him in keeping. —Cease moan, Cytherea! leave pomps for to-day, And weep new when a new year refits thee for weeping. SONG OF THE ROSE. ATTRIBUTED TO SAPPHO. (From Achilles Tatius.) If Zeus chose us a King of the flowers in his mirth, He would call to the Rose and would royally crown it; For the Rose, ho, the Rose! is the grace of the earth, Is the light of the plants that are growing upon it: For the Rose, ho, the Rose! is the eye of the flowers, Is the blush of the meadows that feel themselves fair, Is the lightning of beauty that strikes through the bowers On pale lovers who sit in the glow unaware. Ho, the Rose breathes of love! ho, the Rose lifts the cup To the red lips of Cypris invoked for a guest! Ho, the Rose, having curled its sweet leaves for the world, Takes delight in the motion its petals keep up, As they laugh to the wind as it laughs from the west! FROM THEOCRITUS. THE CYCLOPS. (IDYL XI.) And so an easier life our Cyclops drew, The ancient Polyphemus, who in youth Loved Galatea while the manhood grew Adown his cheeks and darkened round his mouth. No jot he cared for apples, olives, roses; Love made him mad: the whole world was neglected, The very sheep went backward to their closes From out the fair green pastures, self-directed. And singing Galatea, thus, he wore The sunrise down along the weedy shore, And pined alone, and felt the cruel wound Beneath his heart, which Cypris' arrow bore, With a deep pang; but, so, the cure was found; And sitting on a lofty rock he cast His eyes upon the sea, and sang at last:— “O whitest Galatea, can it be That thou shouldst spurn me off who love thee so? More white than curds, my girl, thou art to see, More meek than lambs, more full of leaping glee Than kids, and brighter than the early glow On grapes that swell to ripen,—sour like thee! Thou comest to me with the fragrant sleep, And with the fragrant sleep thou goest from me; Thou fliest . . . fliest, as a frightened sheep Flies the grey wolf!—yet Love did overcome me, So long;—I loved thee, maiden, first of all When down the hills (my mother fast beside thee) I saw thee stray to pluck the summer-fall Of hyacinth bells, and went myself to guide thee: And since my eyes have seen thee, they can leave thee No more, from that day's light! But thou . . . by Zeus, Thou wilt not care for that, to let it grieve thee! I know thee, fair one, why thou springest loose From my arm round thee. Why? I tell thee, Dear! One shaggy eyebrow draws its smudging road Straight through my ample front, from ear to ear,— One eye rolls underneath; and yawning, broad Flat nostrils feel the bulging lips too near. Yet . . . ho, ho!—I,—whatever I appear,— Do feed a thousand oxen! When I have done, I milk the cows, and drink the milk that's best! I lack no cheese, while summer keeps the sun; And after, in the cold, it's ready prest! And then, I know to sing, as there is none Of all the Cyclops can, . . . a song of thee, Sweet apple of my soul, on love's fair tree, And of myself who love thee . . . till the West Forgets the light, and all but I have rest. I feed for thee, besides, eleven fair does, And all in fawn; and four tame whelps of bears. Come to me, Sweet! thou shalt have all of those In change for love! I will not halve the shares. Leave the blue sea, with pure white arms extended To the dry shore; and, in my cave's recess, Thou shalt be gladder for the noonlight ended,— For here be laurels, spiral cypresses, Dark ivy, and a vine whose leaves enfold Most luscious grapes; and here is water cold, The wooded Ætna pours down through the trees From the white snows,—which gods were scarce too bold To drink in turn with nectar. Who with these Would choose the salt wave of the luke-warm seas? Nay, look on me! If I am hairy and rough, I have an oak's heart in me; there's a fire In these grey ashes which burns hot enough; And when I burn for thee, I grudge the pyre No fuel . . . not my soul, nor this one eye,— Most precious thing I have, because thereby I see thee, Fairest! Out, alas! I wish My mother had borne me finnèd like a fish, That I might plunge down in the ocean near thee, And kiss thy glittering hand between the weeds, If still thy face were turned; and I would bear thee Each lily white, and poppy fair that bleeds Its red heart down its leaves!—one gift, for hours Of summer,—one, for winter; since, to cheer thee, I could not bring at once all kinds of flowers. Even now, girl, now, I fain would learn to swim, If stranger in a ship sailed nigh, I wis,— That I may know how sweet a thing it is To live down with you in the Deep and Dim! Come up, O Galatea, from the ocean, And, having come, forget again to go! As I, who sing out here my heart's emotion, Could sit for ever. Come up from below! Come, keep my flocks beside me, milk my kine,— Come, press my cheese, distrain my whey and curd! Ah, mother! she alone . . . that mother of mine . . . Did wrong me sore! I blame her!—Not a word Of kindly intercession did she address Thine ear with for my sake; and ne'ertheless She saw me wasting, wasting, day by day: Both head and feet were aching, I will say, All sick for grief, as I myself was sick. O Cyclops, Cyclops, whither hast thou sent Thy soul on fluttering wings? If thou wert bent On turning bowls, or pulling green and thick The sprouts to give thy lambkins,—thou wouldst make thee A wiser Cyclops than for what we take thee. Milk dry the present! Why pursue too quick That future which is fugitive aright? Thy Galatea thou shalt haply find,— Or else a maiden fairer and more kind; For many girls do call me through the night, And, as they call, do laugh out silverly. I, too, am something in the world, I see!” While thus the Cyclops love and lambs did fold, Ease came with song he could not buy with gold. FROM APULEIUS. PSYCHE GAZING ON CUPID. (METAMORPH., LIB. IV.) Then Psyche, weak in body and soul, put on The cruelty of Fate, in place of strength: She raised the lamp to see what should be done, And seized the steel, and was a man at length In courage, though a woman! Yes, but when The light fell on the bed whereby she stood To view the “beast” that lay there,—certes, then, She saw the gentlest, sweetést beast in wood— Even Cupid's self, the beauteous god! more beauteous For that sweet sleep across his eyelids dim. The light, the lady carried as she viewed, Did blush for pleasure as it lighted him, The dagger trembled from its aim unduteous; And she . . . oh, she—amazed and soul-distraught, And fainting in her whiteness like a veil, Slid down upon her knees, and, shuddering, thought To hide—though in her heart—the dagger pale! She would have done it, but her hands did fail To hold the guilty steel, they shivered so,— And feeble, exhausted, unawares she took To gazing on the god,—till, look by look, Her eyes with larger life did fill and glow. She saw his golden head alight with curls,— She might have guessed their brightness in the dark By that ambrosial smell of heavenly mark! She saw the milky brow, more pure than pearls, The purple of the cheeks, divinely sundered By the globed ringlets, as they glided free, Some back, some forwards,—all so radiantly, That, as she watched them there, she never wondered To see the lamplight, where it touched them, tremble: On the god's shoulders, too, she marked his wings Shine faintly at the edges and resemble A flower that's near to blow. The poet sings And lover sighs, that Love is fugitive; And certes, though these pinions lay reposing, The feathers on them seemed to stir and live As if by instinct, closing and unclosing. Meantime the god's fair body slumbered deep, All worthy of Venus, in his shining sleep; While at the bed's foot lay the quiver, bow, And darts,—his arms of godhead. Psyche gazed With eyes that drank the wonders in,—said,—“Lo, Be these my husband's arms?”—and straightway raised An arrow from the quiver-case, and tried Its point against her finger,—trembling till She pushed it in too deeply (foolish bride!) And made her blood some dewdrops small distil, And learnt to love Love, of her own goodwill. PSYCHE WAFTED BY ZEPHYRUS. (METAMORPH., LIB. IV.) While Psyche wept upon the rock forsaken, Alone, despairing, dreading,—gradually By Zephyrus she was enwrapt and taken Still trembling,—like the lilies planted high,— Through all her fair white limbs. Her vesture spread, Her very bosom eddying with surprise,— He drew her slowly from the mountain-head, And bore her down the valleys with wet eyes, And laid her in the lap of a green dell As soft with grass and flowers as any nest, With trees beside her, and a limpid well: Yet Love was not far off from all that Rest. PSYCHE AND PAN. (METAMORPH., LIB. V.) The gentle River, in her Cupid's honour, Because he used to warm the very wave, Did ripple aside, instead of closing on her, And cast up Psyche, with a refluence brave, Upon the flowery bank,—all sad and sinning. Then Pan, the rural god, by chance was leaning Along the brow of waters as they wound, Kissing the reed-nymph till she sank to ground, And teaching, without knowledge of the meaning, To run her voice in music after his Down many a shifting note; (the goats around, In wandering pasture and most leaping bliss, Drawn on to crop the river's flowery hair). And as the hoary god beheld her there, The poor, worn, fainting Psyche!—knowing all The grief she suffered, he did gently call Her name, and softly comfort her despair:— “O wise, fair lady, I am rough and rude, And yet experienced through my weary age! And if I read aright, as soothsayer should, Thy faltering steps of heavy pilgrimage, Thy paleness, deep as snow we cannot see The roses through,—thy sighs of quick returning, Thine eyes that seem, themselves, two souls in mourning,— Thou lovest, girl, too well, and bitterly! But hear me: rush no more to a headlong fall: Seek no more deaths! leave wail, lay sorrow down, And pray the sovran god; and use withal Such prayer as best may suit a tender youth, Well-pleased to bend to flatteries from thy mouth, And feel them stir the myrtle of his crown.” —So spake the shepherd-god; and answer none Gave Psyche in return: but silently She did him homage with a bended knee, And took the onward path.— PSYCHE PROPITIATING CERES. (METAMORPH., LIB. VI.) Then mother Ceres from afar beheld her, While Psyche touched, with reverent fingers meek, The temple's scythes; and with a cry compelled her:— “O wretched Psyche, Venus roams to seek Thy wandering footsteps round the weary earth, Anxious and maddened, and adjures thee forth To accept the imputed pang, and let her wreak Full vengeance with full force of deity! Yet thou, forsooth, art in my temple here, Touching my scythes, assuming my degree, And daring to have thoughts that are not fear!” —But Psyche clung to her feet, and as they moved Rained tears along their track, tear dropped on tear, And drew the dust on in her trailing locks, And still, with passionate prayer, the charge disproved:— “Now, by thy right hand's gathering from the shocks Of golden corn,—and by thy gladsome rites Of harvest,—and thy consecrated sights Shut safe and mute in chests,—and by the course Of thy slave-dragons,—and the driving force Of ploughs along Sicilian glebes profound,— By thy swift chariot,—by thy steadfast ground,— By all those nuptial torches that departed With thy lost daughter,—and by those that shone Back with her, when she came again glad-hearted,— And by all other mysteries which are done In silence at Eleusis,—I beseech thee, O Ceres, take some pity, and abstain From giving to my soul extremer pain Who am the wretched Psyche! Let me teach thee A little mercy, and have thy leave to spend A few days only in thy garnered corn, Until that wrathful goddess, at the end, Shall feel her hate grow mild the longer borne,— Or till, alas!—this faintness at my breast Pass from me, and my spirit apprehend From life-long woe a breath-time hour of rest!” —But Ceres answered “I am moved indeed By prayers so moist with tears, and would defend The poor beseecher from more utter need: But where old oaths, anterior ties, commend, I cannot fail to a sister, lie to a friend, As Venus is to me. Depart with speed!” PSYCHE AND THE EAGLE. (METAMORPH., LIB. VI.) But sovran Jove's rapacious Bird, the regal High percher on the lightning, the great eagle, Drove down with rushing wings; and,—thinking how, By Cupid's help, he bore from Ida's brow A cup-boy for his master,—he inclined To yield, in just return, an influence kind; The god being honoured in his lady's woe. And thus the Bird wheeled downward from the track, Gods follow gods in, to the level low Of that poor face of Psyche left in wrack. —“Now fie, thou simple girl!” the Bird began; “For if thou think to steal and carry back A drop of holiest stream that ever ran, No simpler thought, methinks, were found in man. What! know'st thou not these Stygian waters be Most holy, even to Jove? that as, on earth, Men swear by gods, and by the thunder's worth, Even so the heavenly gods do utter forth Their oaths by Styx's flowing majesty? And yet, one little urnful, I agree To grant thy need!” Whereat, all hastily, He takes it, fills it from the willing wave, And bears it in his beak, incarnadined By the last Titan-prey he screamed to have; And, striking calmly out, against the wind, Vast wings on each side,—there, where Psyche stands, He drops the urn down in her lifted hands. PSYCHE AND CERBERUS. (METAMORPH., LIB. VI.) A mighty dog with three colossal necks, And heads in grand proportion; vast as fear, With jaws that bark the thunder out that breaks In most innocuous dread for ghosts anear, Who are safe in death from sorrow: he reclines Across the threshold of queen Proserpine's Dark-sweeping halls, and, there, for Pluto's spouse, Doth guard the entrance of the empty house. When Psyche threw the cake to him, once amain He howled up wildly from his hunger-pain, And was still, after.— PSYCHE AND PROSERPINE. (METAMORPH., LIB. VI.) Then Psyche entered in to Proserpine In the dark house, and straightway did decline With meek denial the luxurious seat, The liberal board for welcome strangers spread, But sat down lowly at the dark queen's feet, And told her tale, and brake her oaten bread. And when she had given the pyx in humble duty, And told how Venus did entreat the queen To fill it up with only one day's beauty She used in Hades, star-bright and serene, To beautify the Cyprian, who had been All spoilt with grief in nursing her sick boy,— Then Proserpine, in malice and in joy, Smiled in the shade, and took the pyx, and put A secret in it; and so, filled and shut, Gave it again to Psyche. Could she tell It held no beauty, but a dream of hell? PSYCHE AND VENUS. (METAMORPH., LIB. VI.) And Psyche brought to Venus what was sent By Pluto's spouse; the paler, that she went So low to seek it, down the dark descent. MERCURY CARRIES PSYCHE TO OLYMPUS. (METAMORPH., LIB. VI.) Then Jove commanded the god Mercury To float up Psyche from the earth. And she Sprang at the first word, as the fountain springs, And shot up bright and rustling through his wings. MARRIAGE OF PSYCHE AND CUPID. (METAMORPH., LIB. VI.) And Jove's right hand approached the ambrosial bowl To Psyche's lips, that scarce dared yet to smile,— “Drink, O my daughter, and acquaint thy soul With deathless uses, and be glad the while! No more shall Cupid leave thy lovely side; Thy marriage-joy begins for never-ending.” While yet he spake,—the nuptial feast supplied,— The bridegroom on the festive couch was bending O'er Psyche in his bosom—Jove, the same, On Juno, and the other deities, Alike ranged round. The rural cup-boy came And poured Jove's nectar out with shining eyes, While Bacchus, for the others, did as much, And Vulcan spread the meal; and all the Hours Made all things purple with a sprinkle of flowers, Or roses chiefly, not to say the touch Of their sweet fingers; and the Graces glided Their balm around, and the Muses, through the air, Struck out clear voices, which were still divided By that divinest song Apollo there Intoned to his lute; while Aphroditè fair Did float her beauty along the tune, and play The notes right with her feet. And thus, the day Through every perfect mood of joy was carried. The Muses sang their chorus; Satyrus Did blow his pipes; Pan touched his reed;—and thus At last were Cupid and his Psyche married. FROM NONNUS. HOW BACCHUS FINDS ARIADNE SLEEPING. (DIONYSIACA, LIB. XLVII.) When Bacchus first beheld the desolate And sleeping Ariadne, wonder straight Was mixed with love in his great golden eyes; He turned to his Bacchantes in surprise, And said with guarded voice,—“Hush! strike no more Your brazen cymbals; keep those voices still Of voice and pipe; and since ye stand before Queen Cypris, let her slumber as she will! And yet the cestus is not here in proof. A Grace, perhaps, whom sleep has stolen aloof: In which case, as the morning shines in view, Wake this Aglaia!—yet in Naxos, who Would veil a Grace so? Hush! And if that she Were Hebe, which of all the gods can be The pourer-out of wine? or if we think She's like the shining moon by ocean's brink, The guide of herds,—why, could she sleep without Endymion's breath on her check? or if I doubt Of silver-footed Thetis, used to tread These shores,—even she (in reverence be it said) Has no such rosy beauty to dress deep With the blue waves. The Loxian goddess might Repose so from her hunting-toil aright Beside the sea, since toil gives birth to sleep, But who would find her with her tunic loose, Thus? Stand off, Thracian! stand off! Do not leap, Not this way! Leave that piping, since I choose, O dearest Pan, and let Athenè rest! And yet if she be Pallas . . . truly guessed . . . Her lance is—where? her helm and ægis—where?” —As Bacchus closed, the miserable Fair Awoke at last, sprang upward from the sands, And gazing wild on that wild throng that stands Around, around her, and no Theseus there!— Her voice went moaning over shore and sea, Beside the halcyon's cry; she called her love; She named her hero, and raged maddeningly Against the brine of waters; and, above, Sought the ship's track, and cursed the hours she slept; And still the chiefest execration swept Against queen Paphia, mother of the ocean; And cursed and prayed by times in her emotion The winds all round. Her grief did make her glorious; her despair Adorned her with its weight. Poor wailing child! She looked like Venus when the goddess smiled At liberty of godship, debonair; Poor Ariadne! and her eyelids fair Hid looks beneath them lent her by Persuasion And every Grace, with tears of Love's own passion. She wept long; then she spake:—“Sweet sleep did come While sweetest Theseus went. Oh, glad and dumb, I wish he had left me still! for in my sleep I saw his Athens, and did gladly keep My new bride-state within my Theseus' hall; And heard the pomp of Hymen, and the call Of ‘Ariadne, Ariadne,’ sung In choral joy; and there, with joy I hung Spring-blossoms round love's altar!—ay, and wore A wreath myself; and felt him evermore, Oh, evermore beside me, with his mighty Grave head bowed down in prayer to Aphroditè! Why, what a sweet, sweet dream! He went with it, And left me here unwedded where I sit! Persuasion help me! The dark night did make me A brideship, the fair morning takes away; My Love had left me when the Hour did wake me; And while I dreamed of marriage, as I say, And blest it well, my blessèd Theseus left me: And thus the sleep, I loved so, has bereft me. Speak to me, rocks, and tell my grief to-day, Who stole my love of Athens?” . . . HOW BACCHUS COMFORTS ARIADNE. (DIONYSIACA, LIB. XLVII.) Then Bacchus' subtle speech her sorrow crossed:— “O maiden, dost thou mourn for having lost The false Athenian heart? and dost thou still Take thought of Theseus, when thou mayst at will Have Bacchus for a husband? Bacchus bright! A god in place of mortal! Yes, and though The mortal youth be charming in thy sight, That man of Athens cannot strive below, In beauty and valour, with my deity! Thou'lt tell me of the labyrinthine dweller, The fierce man-bull he slew: I pray thee, be, Fair Ariadne, the true deed's true teller, And mention thy clue's help! because, forsooth, Thine armed Athenian hero had not found A power to fight on that prodigious ground, Unless a lady in her rosy youth Had lingered near him: not to speak the truth Too definitely out till names be known— Like Paphia's—Love's—and Ariadne's own. Thou wilt not say that Athens can compare With Æther, nor that Minos rules like Zeus, Nor yet that Gnossus has such golden air As high Olympus. Ha! for noble use We came to Naxos! Love has well intended To change thy bridegroom! Happy thou, defended From entering in thy Theseus' earthly hall, That thou mayst hear the laughters rise and fall Instead, where Bacchus rules! Or wilt thou choose A still-surpassing glory?—take it all,— A heavenly house, Kronion's self for kin,— A place where Cassiopea sits within Inferior light, for all her daughter's sake, Since Perseus, even amid the stars, must take Andromeda in chains æthereal! But I will wreathe thee, sweet, an astral crown, And as my queen and spouse thou shalt be known— Mine, the crown-lover's!” Thus, at length, he proved His comfort on her; and the maid was moved; And casting Theseus' memory down the brine, She straight received the troth of her divine Fair Bacchus; Love stood by to close the rite; The marriage-chorus struck up clear and light, Flowers sprouted fast about the chamber green, And with spring-garlands on their heads, I ween, The Orchomenian dancers came along And danced their rounds in Naxos to the song. A Hamadryad sang a nuptial dit Right shrilly: and a Naiad sat beside A fountain, with her bare foot shelving it, And hymned of Ariadne, beauteous bride, Whom thus the god of grapes had deified. Ortygia sang out, louder than her wont, An ode which Phœbus gave her to be tried, And leapt in chorus, with her steadfast front, While prophet Love, the stars have called a brother, Burnt in his crown, and twined in one another His love-flower with the purple roses, given In type of that new crown assigned in heaven. FROM HESIOD. BACCHUS AND ARIADNE. (THEOG. 947.) The golden-hairèd Bacchus did espouse That fairest Ariadne, Minos' daughter, And made her wifehood blossom in the house; Where such protective gifts Kronion brought her, Nor Death nor Age could find her when they sought her. FROM EURIPIDES. AURORA AND TITHONUS. (TROADES, ANTISTROPHE, 853.) Love, Love, who once didst pass the Dardan portals, Because of Heavenly passion! Who once didst lift up Troy in exultation, To mingle in thy bond the high Immortals!— Love, turned from his own name To Zeus's shame, Can help no more at all. And Eos' self, the fair, white-steeded Morning,— Her light which blesses other lands, returning, Has changed to a gloomy pall! She looked across the land with eyes of amber,— She saw the city's fall,— She who, in pure embraces, Had held there, in the hymeneal chamber, Her children's father, bright Tithonus old, Whom the four steeds with starry brows and paces Bore on, snatched upward, on the car of gold, And with him, all the land's full hope of joy! The love-charms of the gods are vain for Troy. Note.—Rendered after Mr. Burges' reading, in some respects—not quite all. FROM HOMER. HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE. (ILIAD, LIB. VI.) She rushed to meet him: the nurse following Bore on her bosom the unsaddened child, A simple babe, prince Hector's well-loved son, Like a star shining when the world is dark. Scamandrius, Hector called him; but the rest Named him Astyanax, the city's prince, Because that Hector only had saved Troy. He, when he saw his son, smiled silently; While, dropping tears, Andromache pressed on, And clung to his hand, and spake, and named his name. “Hector, my best one,—thine own nobleness Must needs undo thee. Pity hast thou none For this young child, and this most sad myself, Who soon shall be thy widow—since that soon The Greeks will slay thee in the general rush— And then, for me, what refuge, 'reft of thee, But to go graveward? Then, no comfort more Shall touch me, as in the old sad times thou know'st— Grief only—grief! I have no father now, No mother mild! Achilles the divine, He slew my father, sacked his lofty Thebes, Cilicia's populous city, and slew its king, Eëtion—father!—did not spoil the corse, Because the Greek revered him in his soul, But burnt the body with its dædal arms, And poured the dust out gently. Round that tomb The Oreads, daughters of the goat-nursed Zeus, Tripped in a ring, and planted their green elms. There were seven brothers with me in the house, Who all went down to Hades in one day,— For he slew all, Achilles the divine, Famed for his swift feet,—slain among their herds Of cloven-footed bulls and flocking sheep! My mother too, who queened it o'er the woods Of Hippoplacia, he, with other spoil, Seized,—and, for golden ransom, freed too late,— Since, as she went home, arrowy Artemis Met her and slew her at my father's door. But—oh my Hector,—thou art still to me Father and mother!—yes, and brother dear, O thou, who art my sweetest spouse beside! Come now, and take me into pity! Stay I' the town here with us! Do not make thy child An orphan, nor a widow thy poor wife! Call up the people to the fig-tree, where The city is most accessible, the wall Most easy of assault!—for thrice thereby The boldest Greeks have mounted to the breach,— Both Ajaxes, the famed Idomeneus, Two sons of Atreus, and the noble one Of Tydeus,—whether taught by some wise seer, Or by their own souls prompted and inspired.” Great Hector answered:—“Lady, for these things It is my part to care. And I fear most My Trojans, and their daughters, and their wives, Who through their long veils would glance scorn at me If, coward-like, I shunned the open war. Nor doth my own soul prompt me to that end! I learnt to be a brave man constantly, And to fight foremost where my Trojans fight, And vindicate my father's glory and mine— Because I know, by instinct and my soul, The day comes that our sacred Troy must fall, And Priam and his people. Knowing which, I have no such grief for all my Trojan's sake, For Hecuba's, for Priam's, our old king, Not for my brothers', who so many and brave Shall bite the dust before our enemies,— As, sweet, for thee!—to think some mailèd Greek Shall lead thee weeping and deprive thy life Of the free sun-sight—that, when gone away To Argos, thou shalt throw the distaff there, Not for thy uses—or shalt carry instead Upon thy loathing brow, as heavy as doom, The water of Greek wells—Messeis' own, Or Hyperea's!—that some stander-by, Marking my tears fall, shall say, ‘This is She, The wife of that same Hector who fought best Of all the Trojans, when all fought for Troy—’ Ay!—and, so speaking, shall renew thy pang That, 'reft of Him so named, thou shouldst survive To a slave's life! But earth shall hide my corse Ere that shriek sound, wherewith thou art dragged from Troy.” Thus Hector spake, and stretched his arms to his child. Against the nurse's breast, with childly cry, The boy clung back, and shunned his father's face, And feared the glittering brass and waving hair Of the high helmet, nodding horror down. The father smiled, the mother could not choose But smile too. Then he lifted from his brow The helm, and set it on the ground to shine: Then, kissed his dear child—raised him with both arms, And thus invoked Zeus and the general gods:— “Zeus, and all godships! grant this boy of mine To be the Trojans' help, as I myself,— To live a brave life and rule well in Troy! Till men shall say, ‘The son exceeds the sire By a far glory.’ Let him bring home spoil Heroic, and make glad his mother's heart.” With which prayer, to his wife's extended arms He gave the child; and she received him straight To her bosom's fragrance—smiling up her tears. Hector gazed on her till his soul was moved; Then softly touched her with his hand and spake. “My best one—'ware of passion and excess In any fear. There's no man in the world Can send me to the grave apart from fate,— And no man . . . Sweet, I tell thee . . . can fly fate— No good nor bad man. Doom is self-fulfilled. But now, go home, and ply thy woman's task Of wheel and distaff! bid thy maidens haste Their occupation. War's a care for men— For all men born in Troy, and chief for me.” Thus spake the noble Hector, and resumed His crested helmet, while his spouse went home; But as she went, still looked back lovingly, Dropping the tears from her reverted face. THE DAUGHTERS OF PANDARUS. (ODYSS., LIB. XX.) And so these daughters fair of Pandarus The whirlwinds took. The gods had slain their kin: They were left orphans in their father's house. And Aphroditè came to comfort them With incense, luscious honey, and fragrant wine; And Herè gave them beauty of face and soul Beyond all women; purest Artemis Endowed them with her stature and white grace; And Pallas taught their hands to flash along Her famous looms. Then, bright with deity, Toward far Olympus, Aphroditè went To ask of Zeus (who has his thunder-joys And his full knowledge of man's mingled fate) How best to crown those other gifts with love And worthy marriage: but, what time she went, The ravishing Harpies snatched the maids away, And gave them up, for all their loving eyes, To serve the Furies who hate constantly. ANOTHER VERSION. So the storms bore the daughters of Pandarus out into thrall— The gods slew their parents; the orphans were left in the hall. And there, came, to feed their young lives, Aphroditè divine, With the incense, the sweet-tasting honey, the sweet-smelling wine; Herè brought them her wit above woman's, and beauty of face; And pure Artemis gave them her stature, that form might have grace: And Athenè instructed their hands in her works of renown; Then, afar to Olympus, divine Aphroditè moved on: To complete other gifts, by uniting each girl to a mate, She sought Zeus, who has joy in the thunder and knowledge of fate, Whether mortals have good chance or ill. But the Harpies alate In the storm came, and swept off the maidens, and gave them to wait, With that love in their eyes, on the Furies who constantly hate. FROM ANACREON. ODE TO THE SWALLOW. Thou indeed, little Swallow, A sweet yearly comer, Art building a hollow New nest every summer, And straight dost depart Where no gazing can follow, Past Memphis, down Nile! Ah! but Love all the while Builds his nest in my heart, Through the cold winter-weeks: And as one Love takes flight, Comes another, O Swallow, In an egg warm and white, And another is callow. And the large gaping beaks Chirp all day and all night: And the Loves who are older Help the young and the poor Loves, And the young Loves grown bolder Increase by the score Loves— Why, what can be done? If a noise comes from one Can I bear all this rout of a hundred and more Loves? FROM HEINE. THE LAST TRANSLATION. (Rome, 1860.) I. I Out of my own great woe I make my little songs, Which rustle their feathers in throngs And beat on her heart even so. II They found the way, for their part, Yet come again, and complain: Complain, and are not fain To say what they saw in her heart. II. I Art thou indeed so adverse? Art thou so changed indeed? Against the woman who wrongs me I cry to the world in my need. II O recreant lips unthankful, How could ye speak evil, say, Of the man who so well has kissed you On many a fortunate day? III. I My child, we were two children, Small, merry by childhood's law; We used to crawl to the hen-house And hide ourselves in the straw. II We crowed like cocks, and whenever The passers near us drew— Cock-a-doodle! they thought 'Twas a real cock that crew. III The boxes about our courtyard We carpeted to our mind, And lived there both together— Kept house in a noble kind. IV The neighbour's old cat often Came to pay us a visit; We made her a bow and curtsey, Each with a compliment in it. V After her health we asked, Our care and regard to evince— (We have made the very same speeches To many an old cat since). VI We also sat and wisely Discoursed, as old folk do, Complaining how all went better In those good times we knew,— VII How love and truth and believing Had left the world to itself, And how so dear was the coffee, And how so rare was the pelf. VIII The children's games are over, The rest is over with youth— The world, the good games, the good times, The belief, and the love, and the truth. IV. I Thou lovest me not, thou lovest me not! 'Tis scarcely worth a sigh: Let me look in thy face, and no king in his place Is a gladder man than I. II Thou hatest me well, thou hatest me well— Thy little red mouth has told: Let it reach me a kiss, and, however it is, My child, I am well consoled. V. I My own sweet Love, if thou in the grave, The darksome grave, wilt be, Then will I go down by the side, and crave Love-room for thee and me. II I kiss and caress and press thee wild, Thou still, thou cold, thou white! I wail, I tremble, and weeping mild, Turn to a corpse at the right. III The Dead stand up, the midnight calls, They dance in airy swarms— We two keep still where the grave-shade falls, And I lie on in thine arms. IV The Dead stand up, the Judgment-day Bids such to weal or woe— But nought shall trouble us where we stay Embraced and embracing below. VI. I The years they come and go, The races drop in the grave, Yet never the love doth so Which here in my heart I have. II Could I see thee but once, one day, And sink down so on my knee, And die in thy sight while I say, “Lady, I love but thee!”</field>

[[Excerpt from Gregory Nazianzen.]] Where are my wingèd words? Dissolved in air. Where is my flower of youth? All withered. Where My glory? Vanished. Where the strength I knew From comely limbs? Disease hath changed it too, And bent them. Where the riches and the lands? God hath them! Yea, and sinners' snatching hands Have grudged the rest. Where is my father, mother, And where my blessed sister, my sweet brother? Gone to the grave!—There did remain for me Alone my fatherland, till destiny, Malignly stirring a black tempest, drove My foot from that last rest. And now I rove Estranged and desolate a foreign shore, And drag my mournful life and age all hoar Throneless and cityless, and childless save This father-care for children, which I have, Living from day to day on wandering feet. Where shall I cast this body? What will greet My sorrows with an end? What gentle ground And hospitable grave will wrap me round? Who last my dying eyelids stoop to close— Some saint, the Saviour's friend? or one of those Who do not know Him? The air interpose, And scatter these words too. SOUL AND BODY. What wilt thou possess or be? O my soul, I ask of thee. What of great, or what of small, Counted precious therewithal? Be it only rare, and want it, I am ready, soul, to grant it. Wilt thou choose to have and hold Lydian Gyges' charm of old, So to rule us with a ring, Turning round the jewelled thing, Hidden by its face concealed, And revealed by its revealed? Or preferrest Midas' fate— He who died in golden state, All things being changed to gold? Of a golden hunger dying, Through a surfeit of “would I”-ing! Wilt have jewels brightly cold, Or may fertile acres please? Or the sheep of many a fold, Camels, oxen, for the wold? Nay! I will not give thee these! These to take thou hast not will, These to give I have not skill; Since I cast earth's cares abroad, That day when I turned to God. Wouldst a throne, a crown sublime, Bubble blown upon the time? So thou mayest sit to-morrow Looking downward in meek sorrow, Some one walking by thee scorning Who adored thee yester morning, Some malign one? Wilt be bound Fast in marriage (joy unsound!) And be turnèd round and round As the time turns? Wilt thou catch it, That sweet sickness? and to match it Have babies by the hearth, bewildering? And if I tell thee the best children Are none—what answer? Wilt thou thunder Thy rhetorics, move the people under? Covetest to sell the laws With no justice in thy cause, And bear on, or else be borne, Before tribunals worthy scorn? Wilt thou shake a javelin rather Breathing war? or wilt thou gather Garlands from the wrestler's ring? Or kill beasts for glorying? Covetest the city's shout, And to be in brass struck out? Cravest thou that shade of dreaming, Passing air of shifting seeming, Rushing of a printless arrow, Clapping echo of a hand? What to those who understand Are to-day's enjoyments narrow Which to-morrow go again, Which are shared with evil men, And of which no man in his dying Taketh aught for softer lying? What then wouldst thou, if thy mood Choose not these? what wilt thou be, O my soul—a deity? A God before the face of God, Standing glorious in His glories, Choral in His angels' chorus? Go! upon thy wing arise, Plumèd by quick energies, Mount in circles up the skies: And I will bless thy wingèd passion, Help with words thine exaltation, And, like a bird of rapid feather, Outlaunch thee, Soul, upon the æther. But thou, O fleshly nature, say, Thou with odours from the clay, Since thy presence I must have As a lady with a slave, What wouldst thou possess or be, That thy breath may stay with thee? Nay! I owe thee nought beside, Though thine hands be open wide. Would a table suit thy wishes, Fragrant with sweet oils and dishes Wrought to subtle niceness? where Stringèd music strokes the air, And blithe hand-clappings, and the smooth Fine postures of the tender youth And virgins wheeling through the dance With an unveiled countenance,— Joys for drinkers, who love shame, And the maddening wine-cup's flame. Wilt thou such, howe'er decried? Take them,—and a rope beside! Nay! this boon I give instead Unto friend insatiated,— May some rocky house receive thee, Self-roofed, to conceal thee chiefly; Or if labour there must lurk, Be it by a short day's work! And for garment, camel's hair, As the righteous clothèd were, Clothe thee! or the bestial skin Adam's bareness hid within,— Or some green thing from the way, Leaf of herb, or branch of vine, Swelling, purpling as it may, Fearless to be drunk for wine! Spread a table there beneath thee, Which a sweetness shall upbreathe thee, And which the dearest earth is giving, Simple present to all living! When that we have placed thee near it, We will feed thee with glad spirit. Wilt thou eat? soft, take the bread, Oaten cake, if that bested; Salt will season all aright, And thine own good appetite, Which we measure not, nor fetter: 'Tis an uncooked condiment, Famine's self the only better. Wilt thou drink? why, here doth bubble Water from a cup unspent, Followed by no tipsy trouble, Pleasure sacred from the grape! Wilt thou have it in some shape More like luxury? we are No grudgers of wine-vinegar! But if all will not suffice thee, And thou covetest to draw In that pitcher with a flaw, Brimful pleasures heaven denies thee— Go, and seek out, by that sign, Other help than this of mine! For me, I have not leisure so To warm thee, Sweet, my household foe, Until, like a serpent frozen, New-maddened with the heat, thou loosen Thy rescued fang within mine heart! Wilt have measureless delights Of gold-roofed palaces, and sights From pictured or from sculptured art, With motion near their life; and splendour Of bas-relief, with tracery tender, And varied and contrasted hues? Wilt thou have, as nobles use, Broidered robes to flow about thee? Jewelled fingers? Need we doubt thee? Gauds for which the wise will flout thee? I most, who, of all beauty, know It must be inward, to be so! And thus I speak to mortals low, Living for the hour, and o'er Its shadow, seeing nothing more: But for those of nobler bearing, Who live more worthily of wearing A portion of the heavenly nature— To low estate of clayey creature, See, I bring the beggar's meed, Nutriment beyond the need! O, beholder of the Lord, Prove on me the flaming sword! Be mine husbandman, to nourish Holy plants, that words may flourish Of which mine enemy would spoil me, Using pleasurehood to foil me! Lead me closer to the tree Of all life's eternity; Which, as I have pondered, is The knowledge of God's greatnesses: Light of One, and shine of Three, Unto whom all things that be Flow and tend! In such a guise, Whoever on the earth is wise Will speak unto himself: and who Such inner converse would eschew,— We say perforce of that poor wight, “He lived in vain!” and if aright, It is not the worst word we might. [[Excerpts from Amphilochius, on the Right Direction of his Studies and Life.]] They sit unknowing of these agonies, Spectators at a show. When a man flies From a beast's jaw, they groan, as if at least They missed the ravenous pleasure, like the beast, And sat there vainly. When, in the next spring, The victim is attained, and, uttering The deep roar or quick shriek between the fangs, Beats on the dust the passion of his pangs, All pity dieth in that glaring look. They clap to see the blood run like a brook; They stare with hungry eyes, which tears should fill, And cheer the beasts on with their soul's good will; And wish more victims to their maw, and urge And lash their fury, as they shared the surge, Gnashing their teeth, like beasts, on flesh of men. Three hundred lines, three decads, monads three, Comprise my poem. Love the Trinity. [[Synesius' Ninth Ode.]] Well-beloved and glory-laden, Born of Solyma's pure maiden! I would hymn Thee, blessed Warden, Driving from Thy Father's garden Blinking serpent's crafty lust, With his bruised head in the dust! Down Thou camest, low as earth, Bound to those of mortal birth; Down Thou camest, low as hell, Where shepherd-Death did tend and keep A thousand nations like to sheep, While weak with age old Hades fell Shivering through his dark to view Thee, And the Dog did backward yell With jaws all gory to let through Thee! So, redeeming from their pain Choirs of disembodied ones, Thou didst lead whom Thou didst gather, Upward in ascent again, With a great hymn to the Father, Upward to the pure white thrones! King, the dæmon tribes of air Shuddered back to feel Thee there! And the holy stars stood breathless, Trembling in their chorus deathless; A low laughter fillèd æther— Harmony's most subtle sire From the seven strings of his lyre Stroked a measured music hither— Io pæan! victory! Smiled the star of morning—he Who smileth to foreshow the day! Smilèd Hesperus the golden, Who smileth soft for Venus gay! While that hornèd glory holden Brimful from the fount of fire, The white moon, was leading higher In a gentle pastoral wise All the nightly deities! Yea, and Titan threw abroad The far shining of his hair 'Neath Thy footsteps holy-fair, Owning Thee the Son of God; The Mind artificer of all, And his own fire's original! And Thou upon Thy wing of will Mounting,—Thy God-foot uptill The neck of the blue firmament,— Soaring, didst alight content Where the spirit-spheres were singing, And the fount of good was springing, In the silent heaven! Where Time is not with his tide Ever running, never weary, Drawing earth-born things aside Against the rocks: nor yet are given The plagues death-bold that ride the dreary Tost matter-depths. Eternity Assumes the places which they yield! Not aged, howsoe'er she held Her crown from everlastingly— At once of youth, at once of eld, While in that mansion which is hers To God and gods she ministers! [[Excerpt from Synesius.]] O my deathless, O my blessed, Maid-born, glorious son confessed, O my Christ of Solyma! I who earliest learnt to play This measure for Thee, fain would bring Its new sweet tune to citern-string— Be propitious, O my King! Take this music which is mine Anthem'd from the songs divine! We will sing thee, deathless One, God himself and God's great Son— Of sire of endless generations, Son of manifold creations! Nature mutually endued, Wisdom in infinitude! God, before the angels burning— Corpse, among the mortals mourning! What time Thou was pourèd mild From an earthy vase defiled, Magi with fair arts besprent, At Thy new star's orient, Trembled inly, wondered wild, Questioned with their thoughts abroad— “What then is the new-born child? Who the hidden God? God, or corpse, or king? Bring your gifts, oh hither bring Myrrh for rite—for tribute, gold— Frankincense for sacrifice! God! Thine incense take and hold! King! I bring thee gold of price! Myrrh with tomb will harmonise! For Thou, entombed, hast purified Earthly ground and rolling tide, And the path of dæmon nations, And the free air's fluctuations, And the depth below the deep! Thou God, helper of the dead, Low as Hades didst Thou tread! Thou King, gracious aspect keep, Take this music which is mine, Anthem'd from the songs divine. [[Excerpt from Paul Silentiarius.]] Whoever looketh with a mortal eye To heaven's emblazoned forms, not steadfastly With unreverted neck can bear to measure That meadow-round of star-apparelled pleasure, But drops his eyelids to the verdant hill, Yearning to see the river run at will, With flowers on each side,—and the ripening corn, And grove thick set with trees, and flocks at morn Leaping against the dews,—and olives twined, And green vine-branches, trailingly inclined,— And the blue calmness skimmed by dripping oar Along the Golden Horn. But if he bring His foot across this threshold, never more Would he withdraw it; fain, with wandering Moist eyes, and ever-turning head, to stay, Since all satiety is driven away Beyond the noble structure. Such a fane Of blameless beauty hath our Cæsar raised By God's perfective grace, and not in vain! O emperor, these labours we have praised, Draw down the glorious Christ's perpetual smile; For thou, the high-peaked Ossa didst not pile Upon Olympus' head, nor Pelion throw Upon the neck of Ossa, opening so The æther to the steps of mortals! no! Having achieved a work more high than hope, Thou didst not need these mountains as a slope Whereby to scale the heaven! Wings take thee thither From purest piety to highest æther. Who will unclose me Homer's sounding lips, And sing the marble mead that oversweeps The mighty walls and pavements spread around Of this tall temple, which the sun has crowned? The hammer with its iron tooth was loosed Into Carystus' summit green, and bruised The Phrygian shoulder of the dædal stone;— This marble, coloured after roses fused In a white air, and that, with flowers thereon Both purple and silver, shining tenderly! And that which in the broad fair Nile sank low The barges to their edge, the porphyry's glow Sown thick with little stars! and thou mayst see The green stone of Laconia glitter free! And all the Carian hill's deep bosom brings, Streaked bow-wise, with a livid white and red,— And all the Lydian chasm keeps covered, A hueless blossom with a ruddier one Soft mingled! all, besides, the Libyan sun Warms with his golden splendour, till he make A golden yellow glory for his sake, Along the roots of the Maurusian height; And all the Celtic mountains give to sight From crystal clefts: black marbles dappled fair With milky distillations here and there! And all the onyx yields in metal-shine Of precious greenness!—all that land of thine, Ætolia, hath on even plains engendered But not on mountain-tops,—a marble rendered Here nigh to green, of tints which emeralds use, Here with a sombre purple in the hues! Some marbles are like new-dropt snow, and some Alight with blackness! Beauty's rays have come, So congregate, beneath this holy dome! [[Excerpt from John Geometra.]] O health to thee! new living car of the sky, Afire on the wheels of four virtues at once! O health to thee! Seat, than the cherubs more high, More pure than the seraphs, more broad than the thrones! [[Excerpt from John Geometra.]] O health to me, royal one! if there belong Any grace to my singing, that grace is from thee. O health to me, royal one! if in my song Thou hast pleasure, oh, thine is the grace of the glee! [[Excerpt from George Pisida.]] Whatever eyes seek God to view His Light, As far as they behold Him close in night! Whoever searcheth with insatiate balls Th' abysmal glare, or gazeth on Heaven's walls Against the fire-disk of the sun, the same According to the vision he may claim, Is dazzled from his sense. What soul of flame Is called sufficient to view onward thus The way whereby the sun's light came to us? O distant Presence in fixed motion! Known To all men, and inscrutable to one: Perceived—uncomprehended! unexplained To all the spirits, yet by each attained, Because its God-sight is Thy work! O Presence, Whatever holy greatness of Thine essence Lie virtue-hidden, Thou hast given our eyes The vision of Thy plastic energies— Not shown in angels only (those create All fiery-hearted, in a mystic state Of bodiless body) but, if order be Of natures more sublime than they or we, In highest Heaven, or mediate æther, or This world now seen, or one that came before Or one to come,—quick in Thy purpose,—there! Working in fire and water, earth and air— In every tuneful star, and tree, and bird— In all the swimming, creeping life unheard, In all green herbs, and chief of all, in man. [[Excerpt from George Pisida's Vanity of Life.]] Some yearn to rule the state, to sit above, And touch the cares of hate as near as love; Some their own reason for tribunal take, And for all thrones the humblest prayers they make; Some love the orator's vain-glorious art,— The wise love silence and the hush of heart,— Some to ambition's spirit-curse are fain, That golden apple with a bloody stain; While some do battle in her face (more rife Of noble ends) and conquer strife with strife: And while your groaning tables gladden these, Satiety's quick chariot to disease, Hunger the wise man helps, to water, bread, And light wings to the dreams about his head. The sage o'er all the world his sceptre waves, And earth is common ground to thrones and graves. [[Excerpt from John Damascenus.]] From my lips in their defilement, From my heart in its beguilement, From my tongue which speaks not fair, From my soul stained everywhere, O my Jesus, take my prayer! Spurn me not for all it says, Not for words and not for ways, Not for shamelessness endued! Make me brave to speak my mood, O my Jesus, as I would! Or teach me, which I rather seek, What to do and what to speak. I have sinnèd more than she, Who learning where to meet with Thee, And bringing myrrh, the highest-priced, Anointed bravely, from her knee, Thy blessed feet accordingly, My God, my Lord, my Christ! As Thou saidest not “Depart” To that suppliant from her heart, Scorn me not, O Word, that art The gentlest one of all words said! But give Thy feet to me instead That tenderly I may them kiss And clasp them close, and never miss With over-dropping tears, as free And precious as that myrrh could be, T' anoint them bravely from my knee! Wash me with Thy tears: draw nigh me, That their salt may purify me. Thou remit my sins who knowest All the sinning to the lowest— Knowest all my wounds, and seest All the stripes Thyself decreest; Yea, but knowest all my faith, Seest all my force to death, Hearest all my wailings low, That mine evil should be so! Nothing hidden but appears In Thy knowledge, O Divine, O Creator, Saviour mine— Not a drop of falling tears, Not a breath of inward moan, Not a heart-beat—which is gone! [[Acrostic from Simeon Metaphrastes.]] Ah, tears upon mine eyelids, sorrow on mine heart, I bring Thee soul-repentance, Creator as Thou art! Bounding joyous actions, deep as arrows go; Pleasures self-revolving, issue into woe! Creatures of our mortal, headlong rush to sin: I have seen them; of them—ah me,—I have been! Duly pitying Spirits, from your spirit-frame, Bring your cloud of weeping,—worthy of the same! Else I would be bolder; if that light of Thine, Jesus, quell the evil, let it on me shine! Fail me truth, is living, less than death forlorn, When the sinner readeth—“better be unborn”? God, I raise toward Thee both eyes of my heart, With a sharp cry—“Help me!”—while mine hopes depart. Help me! Death is bitter, all hearts comprehend; But I fear beyond it—end beyond the end. Inwardly behold me, how my soul is black: Sympathise in gazing, do not spurn me back! Knowing that Thy pleasure is not to destroy, That Thou fain wouldst save me—this is all my joy. Lo, the lion, hunting spirits in their deep, (Stand beside me!) roareth—(help me!) nears to leap. Mayst Thou help me, Master! Thou art pure alone, Thou alone art sinless, one Christ on a throne. Nightly deeds I loved them, hated day's instead; Hence this soul-involving darkness on mine head. O Word, who constrainest things estranged and curst, If Thy hand can save me, that work were the first! Pensive o'er my sinning, counting all its ways, Terrors shake me, waiting adequate dismays. Quenchless glories many, hast Thou—many a rod— Thou, too, hast Thy measures. Can I bear Thee, God? Rend away my counting from my soul's decline, Show me of the portion of those saved of Thine! Slow drops of my weeping to Thy mercy run: Let its rivers wash me, by that mercy won! Tell me what is worthy, in our dreary now, As the future glory? (madness!) what, as Thou? Union, oh, vouchsafe me to Thy fold beneath, Lest the wolf across me gnash his gory teeth! View me, judge me gently! spare me, Master bland, Brightly lift Thine eyelids, kindly stretch Thine hand! Winged and choral angels! 'twixt my spirit lone, And all deathly visions, interpose your own! Yea, my Soul, remember death and woe inwrought— After-death affliction, wringing earth's to nought! Zone me, Lord, with graces! Be foundations built Underneath me; save me! as Thou know'st and wilt! [[Poem from Michael Psellus' On the Councils.]] Know the holy councils, King, to their utmost number, Such as roused the impious ones from their world-wide slumber! Seven in all those councils were: Nice the first containing, When the godly master-soul Constantine was reigning. What time at Byzantium, hallowed with the hyssop, In heart and word, Metrophanes presided as archbishop! It cut away Arius' tongue's maniacal delusion, Which cut off from the Trinity the blessed Homoousion— Blasphemed (O miserable man!) the maker of the creature, And low beneath the Father cast the equal Filial nature. [[Excerpt from John of Euchaita.]] What meditates thy thoughtful gaze, my father? To tell me some new truth? Thou canst not so! For all that mortal hands are weak to gather Thy blessed books unfolded long ago. [[Excerpt from John of Euchaita.]] O Lady of the passion, dost thou weep? What help can we then through our tears survey, If such as thou a cause for wailing keep? What help, what hope, for us, sweet Lady, say? “Good man, it doth befit thine heart to lay More courage next it, having seen me so. All other hearts find other balm to-day— The whole world's consolation is my woe!” [[Excerpt from John of Euchaita.]] Tremble, spectator, at the vision won thee! Stand afar off, look downward from the height, Lest Christ too nearly seen should lighten on thee, And from thy fleshly eyeballs strike the sight, As Paul fell ruined by that glory white! Lo, the disciples prostrate, each apart, Each impotent to bear the lamping light! And all that Moses and Elias might, The darkness caught the grace upon her heart And gave them strength for! Thou, if evermore A God-voice pierce thy dark,—rejoice, adore! [[Excerpt from John of Euchaita's To his old house.]] O be not angry with me, gentle house, That I have left thee empty and deserted! Since thou thyself that evil didst arouse, In being to thy masters so false-hearted, In loving none of those who did possess thee, In minist'ring to no one to an end, In no one's service caring to confess thee, But loving still the change of friend for friend, And sending the last, plague-wise, to the door! And so, or ere thou canst betray and leave me, I, a wise lord, dismiss thee, servitor, And antedate the wrong thou mayst achieve me Against my will, by what my will allows; Yet not without some sorrow, gentle house! For oh, beloved house, what time I render My last look back on thee I grow more tender! Pleasant possession, hearth for father's age, Dear gift of buried hands, sole heritage! My blood is stirred; and love, that learnt its play From all sweet customs, moves mine heart thy way! For thou wast all my nurse and helpful creature, For thou wast all my tutor and my teacher; In thee through lengthening toils I struggled deep, In thee I watched all night without its sleep, In thee I worked the wearier daytime out, Exalting truth, or trying by a doubt. And oh, my father's roof, the memory leaves Such pangs as break mine heart, beloved eaves! But God's word conquers all. Farewell, farewell, mine own familiar one, Estranged for evermore from this day's sun, Fare-thee-well so! Farewell, O second mother, O nurse and help,—remains there not another! My bringer-up to some sublimer measure Of holy childhood and perfected pleasure! Now other spirits must thou tend and teach, And minister thy quiet unto each, For reasoning uses, if they love such use, But nevermore to me. God keep thee, house, God keep thee, faithful corner, where I drew So calm a breath of life! And God keep you, Kind neighbours! Though I leave you by His grace, Let no grief bring a shadow to your face; Because whate'er He willeth to be done His will makes easy, makes the distant—one, And soon brings all embraced before His throne! [[Excerpt from John of Euchaita.]] Love! Lady diademed with honour, whence And whither goest thou? Thy look presents Tears to the lid, thy mien is vext and low, Thy locks fall wildly from thy drooping brow, Thy blushes are all pale, thy garb is fit For mourning in, and shoon and zone are loose! So changed thou art to sadness every whit, And all that pomp and purple thou didst use, That seemly sweet, that new rose on the mouth, Those fair-smoothed tresses, and that graceful zone, Bright sandals, and the rest thou haddest on, Are all departed, gone to nought together! And now thou walkest mournful in the train Of mourning women!—where and whence, again? Love. From earth to God my Father. Stranger. Dost thou say That earth of Love is desolated? Love. Yea! It so much scorned me. Stranger. Scorned? Love. And cast me out From its door. Stranger. From its door? Love. As if without I had my lot to die! [[Excerpt from John of Euchaita's On Providence.]] Ah me! what tears mine eyes are welling forth, To witness in this synagogue of earth Wise men speak wisely while the scoffers sing, And rich men folly, for much honouring! Melitus trifles,—Socrates decrees Our further knowledge! Death to Socrates, And long life to Melitus! . . . Chiefdom of evil, gold! blind child of clay, Gnawing with fixèd tooth earth's heart away! Go! perish from us! objurgation vain To soulles nature, powerless to contain One ill unthrust upon it! Rather perish That turpitude of crowds, by which they cherish Bad men for their good fortune, or condemn, Because of evil fortune, virtuous men! Oh, for a trumpet mouth! an iron tongue Sufficient for all speech! foundations hung High on Parnassus' top to bear my feet! So from that watch-tower, words which shall be meet, I may out-thunder to the nations near me— “Ye worshippers of gold, poor rich men, hear me! Where do ye wander?—for what object stand? That gold is earth's ye carry in your hand, And floweth earthward; bad men have its curse The most profusely: would yourselves be worse So to be richer?—better in your purse? Your royal purple—'twas a dog that found it! Your pearl of price—a sickened oyster owned it! Your glittering gems are pebbles, dust-astray; Your palace pomp was wrought of wood and clay, Smoothed rock and moulded plinth! earth's clay, earth's wood, Earth's common-hearted stones! Is this your mood, To honour earth, to worship earth, nor blush?” What dost thou murmur, savage mouth? Hush, hush, Thy wrath is vainly breathed. The depth to tread Of God's deep judgments, was not Paul's, he said. [[Excerpt from John of Euchaita.]] Oh, take me, thou mortal,—thy Life for thy praiser! Thou hast met, found and seized me, and know'st what my ways are. Nor leave me for slackness, nor yield me for pleasure, Nor look up too saintly, nor muse beyond measure! There's the veil from my head—see the worst of my mourning! There are wheels to my feet—have a dread of their turning! There are wings round my waist—I may flatter and flee thee! There are yokes on my hands—fear the chains I decree thee! Hold me! hold a shadow, the winds as they quiver; Hold me! hold a dream, smoke, a track on the river. Oh, take me, thou mortal,—thy Life for thy praiser, Thou hast met not and seized not, nor know'st what my ways are! Nay, frown not, and shrink not, nor call me an aspen; There's the veil from my head! I have dropped from thy clasping! A fall-back within it I soon may afford thee; There are wheels to my feet—I may roll back toward thee! There are wings round my waist—I may flee back and clip thee! There are yokes on my hands—I may soon cease to whip thee! Take courage! I rather would hearten than hip thee! [[Excerpt from John Tzetza.]] A phœnix is a single bird and synchronous with nature; The peacock cannot equal him in beauty or in stature. In radiance he outshines the gold; the world in wonder yieldeth; His nest he fixeth in the trees, and all of spices buildeth. And when he dies, a little worm, from out his body twining, Doth generate him back again whene'er the sun is shining. He lives in Ægypt, and he dies in Æthiopia only, as Asserts Philostratus, who wrote the Life of Apollonius. And (as the wise Ægyptian scribe, the holy scribe Chæremon, Hath entered on these Institutes, all centre their esteem on) Seven thousand years and six of age, this phœnix of the story Expireth from the fair Nile side, whereby he had his glory. [[Excerpt from Manuel Phile.]] A Grecian island nourisheth to bless A race of herons in all nobleness. If some barbarian bark approach the shore, They hate, they flee,—no eagle can outsoar! But if by chance an Attic voice be wist, They grow softhearted straight, philhellenist; Press on in earnest flocks along the strand, And stretch their wings out to the comer's hand. Perhaps he nears them with a gentle mind,— They love his love, though foreign to their kind! For so the island giveth wingèd teachers, In true love lessons, to all wingless creatures. [[Excerpt from Manuel Phile.]] O living Spirit, O falling of God-dew, O Grace which dost console us and renew, O vital light, O breath of angelhood, O generous ministration of things good, Creator of the visible, and best Upholder of the great unmanifest Power infinitely wise, new boon sublime Of science and of art, constraining might, In whom I breathe, live, speak, rejoice, and write,— Be with us in all places, for all time! [[Excerpt from Manuel Phile.]] Take me as a hermit lone With a desert life and moan; Only Thou anear to mete Slow or quick my pulse's beat; Only Thou, the night to chase With the sunlight in Thy face! Pleasure to the eyes may come From a glory seen afar, But if life concentre gloom Scattered by no little star, Then, how feeble, God, we are! Nay, whatever bird there be, (Æther by his flying stirred,) He, in this thing, must be free— And I, Saviour, am Thy bird, Pricking with an open beak At the words that Thou dost speak! Leave a breath upon my wings, That above these nether things I may rise to where Thou art, I may flutter next Thine heart! For if a light within me burn, It must be darkness in an urn, Unless, within its crystalline, That unbeginning light of Thine Shine! oh, Saviour, let it shine!</field>
