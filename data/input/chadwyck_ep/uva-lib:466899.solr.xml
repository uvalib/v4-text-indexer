      <field name="fulltext">“Of muses, Hobbinoll, I conne no skill, For they bene daughters of the highest Iove, And helden scorn of homely shepheards' quill; For sith I heard that Pan with Phœbus strove, Which him to much rebuke and daunger drove, I never list presume to Parnasse hill, But pyping low in shade of lowly grove, I play to please myselfe, all be it ill.” The Shepheard's Calender. SYRINX. Slowly the sunshine faded from the hill, And dewy twilight found him bending still, With hand on heart—as one who inly bleeds From a deep wound—beside the trembling reeds. Slowly love's star swam up, in bright unrest Far-throbbing o'er Lampeia's purple crest. Slowly, above the pine-wood's deepening shade, White Artemis arose, as half afraid To view the mighty sorrow she had made; Arose, and gazed upon him silently; Then, sloping sadly down the western sky, Sank with a dreary murmur; leaving him In darkness by the river's shadowy brim, Moveless and silent as an oak o'erthrown In some old forest;—till a hollow groan Shuddered athwart the midnight. Syrinx heard Her lover's voice, and half in sorrow stirred— And stirring sighed—and sighing sought to twine Her leaves about him, lying there supine In utter loneliness! The ruthful sound, The tender motion, from his deathly swound Of anguish roused him. Starting up, he cried Aloud, “Thou lov'st me! They shall not divide— Those envious gods—the lover from his bride! Thou shalt be mine! to dwell with me afar In leafy places, where nor moon nor star Can watch our joy: save by our own glad eyen, For ever unespied! Yes! thou art mine: My sylvan queen! I trowed thou couldst not know 'Twas Pan that loved—and scorn him. But, ah, woe! Into the dark I stretch my arms in vain To clasp thee; vacant they come back again! In vain I call thee; to my yearning cry The rocks alone make faint and far reply, Or this hot life-blood surging audibly About my listening heart! . . . The stars look down, The old, familiar stars! The solemn crown Of Erymanthus cleaves the purple gloom; About my feet the beetles crisp and boom, And there the thymy grass is all a-gleam With glow-worms, as of old! It is no dream! No dream!—Ai! ai! I shall behold no more Thy whiteness shame the lilies by the shore Of broad Alpheios, while his amorous wave Fawns at thy feet, alluring thee to lave In his green coolness. Never more behold— Couched in some root-woven antre mossy-old, Deep in the cedarn forest's dim recesses— The sunset burn within thy golden tresses, Or flush with rosy fire from neck to heel All thy disrobèd beauty. Zeus! I reel, Drunk with the maddening wine of love! I die! Life ebbs, despite my immortality, From out my being!—ebbs, and leaves me dry As the hot desert, empty as the wind, And hungry as the sea! Syrinx, be kind! Where hid'st thou, sweet? It cannot, shall not be, These shivering reeds are all that lives of Thee!” He ceased. There was a sighing in the air, A flowery perfume breathing everywhere, A stirring as of pinions, and the beat On the husht ether of aërial feet; While from the region of the western star Came, softly falling, music lovelier far Than aught of earth: a weird, mysterious strain, That o'er his aching heart and burning brain Stole with cool ravishment, like summer rain On the parched woodland, or the far-heard roar Of coming waves along a thirsty shore. Then softer, sweeter, in his tingling ears There was a honeyed whispering; and great tears Burst forth benignant. Solemnly and slow He bowed his shaggy front, and his fierce woe Was lifted from him, as the music wound In widening gyres of interwoven sound Up through the thrilling darkness, till it died Among the stars; and, wave on wave, the tide Of silence closed once more around him, fraught With gentlest soothing, and some new, sweet thought That on his haggard face, like sunshine, wrought A radiant transformation. Silently He raised his hands to heaven, and with a sigh Slow-bending down, took a keen-edgèd stone And tenderly the reed-stems, one by one, Severed in sequent lengths, and side by side Together placed, and with smooth rushes tied. Then, breathless, hearkening for the muffled sound Of the brown wood-bee, working underground, Deftly a honey-weighted comb he found,— Close by a willow root, where the white bosses Of mushrooms glimmered, many-tinted mosses Swelled softly, silver-fretted lichens clung, And whirring night-moths in dim crannies hung Screened by dark ivy,—and the wax did knead In his hot palms, and stopt with cunning speed Flute after flute. And so his task of love At last was ended! Meanwhile, far above, Lycaios' topmost crags had caught the light, That, like a fountain from the sacred height Of clear Cyllene welling silently, Told the dim valleys that the dawn was nigh. From far Stymphalos came the dreary cry Of wakening marsh-fowl, mingled with the fall Of torrent waters, faint and musical, In woody hollows. But by him unheard Or fall of cataract, or wail of bird; By him the silver presage of the morn Unseen; far-wandering in a dream forlorn Of lost delights, of joys that might have been, Of wild regrets! For, evermore, between His vision and the dead reeds lying there Within his listless hands, there came the hair— The odorous, golden hair—the warm, soft hair He grasped so vainly in that cruel chase; And, evermore, that pale and piteous face Grew up before him, with its bright, young eyes, Through drowning tears of terror and surprise, Turned back imploring; and its lips agape With that long shriek of anguish, when escape Grew hopeless. “'Twas but yester eve! The wood Rang to her ringing laughter, as she stood Half in the dancing sunshine, half in shade, Her locks down-showering from their huntress' braid; While round her feet the sylvan creatures played, Lovely and fearless. Lovely and fearless she As Dian's self! And now! ah, woe is me! Arcadia knows her not. The mountain-side Is bare of beauty; valley and forest wide Vacant of joy for ever! And I—even I Who loved her—have destroyed her! I—even I, Who would have cast my old divinity Beneath her feet, to save one tiniest curl On her white neck, one little, dewy pearl Of her sweet mouth, from wrong!” Once more he bowed His head above the reeds, and wept aloud. Not now for baffled passion was his plain; But wild remorse, contrition wild and vain For her so sad undoing.—Though a trace Of the old madness on his pallid face Yet lingered, and within his desolate breast Yet heaved the purple tide in sick unrest. Then—even as one with secret guilt beguiled, May touch the pure lips of a sinless child Who loves him, all unweeting of his shame— Softly he breathed the vanished Oread's name Along the flutes. As in the caves of sleep Lost voices call us fondly, till we weep In that strange ecstasy where joy and woe, Merged in one aimless ache, together flow Down to the sea of rest, the Oread's low, Mellifluous wail of yearning tenderness Made liquid answer to his lips' caress, As from the shore of Lethe, or the bound Of far Elysium. At the wondrous sound, So faint with love, so tremulous with regret, Once more his cheeks with quiet tears were wet, And his fierce heart was chastened; for he knew Her soul was in the reeds, and gently drew The poison from his wound, until the pain, By sympathy transformed, through every vein Pulsed with a tender sadness that now seemed Sweeter than all the rapture he had dreamed. A low wind rippling up the river came. He raised his head. The sky was all a-flame With rosy fire: young Eos was abroad Upon the mountains! Cliff and corrie glowed, Far westward, with the palpitating blaze Of topaz isled in tenderest chrysoprase. And down the mighty gorges to the east— Wine-dark or flusht with lucent amethyst— Sloped the broad shafts of Phoibos. While the mist, As from a thousand altars, upward curled From tarn and cataract, and ghost-like, whirled And flitted round the pines, and died away In the sweet radiance of the new-born day. Still all the narrow vales lay dewy-dark; And not a bird was stirring, save one lark That high o'erhead, the blinding light up-winging, Woke the clear echoes with enchanted singing: A joyous descant, beautiful and strange, For ever changing—sweeter every change! He rose. The joy and glory of the hour Were on his spirit. And the wondrous power, Unfelt till now, of Utterance—born of love And sorrow!—in his heart began to move. Breathing into the reeds impassioned breath, The conscious reeds made answer, and beneath, His glowing lips and fingers glowed. That day There was a new song in Arcadia! A new song and a marvel! From the spurs Of old Lycaios, muffled in dark firs, It seemed to moan. Now from the sunward height It warbled, tremulous with its own delight. Now from some mossy dingle, with the sound Of rushing water blent, it floated round In liquid wailing. Now, far up the hill, About the breezy crags, like laughter shrill It rang, reverberant. Wide-wondering eyes Stared from lone places with a bright surprise, And wept for very joy—if joy it were That thrilled the heart so strangely—as the air Throbbed with the music. Wonder sweet and new Fell on all woodland creatures, till they grew Gentle as by enchantment. In the blue The lark hung rapt in silence. Every noise Of wind or water, every living voice, Was softened, and an awful whisper ran Throughout the listening valleys: It is Pan! LOST LIFE. I. Time's unreturning river Flows moaning down for ever, Through life and death towards that shadowy sea, Within whose tideless deeps The kraken-mystery sleeps: The trancèd ocean of Eternity! I hear the fresh wind rippling in the leaves, The swallows twitter round the barley-sheaves, The homeward reapers in the setting sun Sing merrily, their fragrant labour done; The bee, blue summer's joyous troubadour, Carols for kisses to each damsel-flower; Thy sweet voice fills this consecrated bower With love's own music. But through all, through all, I hear the time-stream's desolating fall, The eternal ocean's melancholy roar: “The past returneth never, never more!” II. My youth was spent in folly; With vestal Melancholy I walked abroad throughout this beauteous earth Culling from all things fair The poison of despair, To murder in my breast the angel mirth; Scorning, for cold abstractions of the mind, The gentle sympathies of human kind; Gazing on vague Ideals, till the eye Grew blind to Nature; ever wearily Seeking afar the beauty round me strewn: Till, in a world of joy, I stood alone, In impious isolation. And though now— Thanks to thy ministry!—my heart can glow With late-found gladness, ghosts of buried woe Will rise to scare me, even in hours like this, And turn to gall the sweetness of thy kiss. THE UNKNOWN PORTRAIT. No. I. Shadow with the golden hair, Phantom with the eyes of blue, What wild thing of earth or air, What bright creature pure and fair, Shall my song compare with you? Not the stately swan that gleams At sunrise down the vale of streams; Not the timid mountain hind, Light of foot as summer wind; Not the skylark, as she springs From her nest on dewy wings, And up the blue lift soaring sings; Not the butterfly that dances All day long from flower to flower; Not the ephemeris that glances, Fitful as a poet's fancies, O'er the tarn beside my bower, Would I dare to match with you, Phantom with the eyes of blue! Nor the sweet young crescent moon In the gloaming-heaven of June; Nor her shadow on the sea, When the wind's low minstrelsy Stirs him in his trancèd sleep; Nor the rainbow-bells that leap Where the fairy-fountain falleth, Softly chiming, ever falleth In the hollow of the granite,— Mab's unbraided locks would span it! Nor a gem of odorous dew In the bosom of a rose, With the sunshine streaming through; Nor that saintliest flower that blows, The virgin lily, as she bendeth O'er some lake ere night descendeth; Nor the planet of the even,— Of all fairest things in heaven Or earth most spirit-like and fair— With your beauty may compare, Shadow with the golden hair! All in vain my fancy strings Names of earth's divinest things, Fondly striving to express Something of your loveliness; But that loveliness as far Theirs transcends as doth the star The dewdrop, or yon stainless round Of sapphire sky the smirched ground. For all things most pure and sweet That nature owneth, blended meet In this angel form and face, Stealing unimagined grace And glory from the unsullied Soul, That dwells within and lights the whole. THE UNKNOWN PORTRAIT. No. II. Brow like summer cloud for whiteness, Eye of heaven's serenest blue, Cheek of day-dawn's blushful brightness, Lip of sunset's rosiest hue, Glossy ringlets waving free Round a neck of ivory; O'er the maiden breast descending, With its holy whiteness blending, Scarce its loveliness concealing, Shading half and half revealing! Surely ye are but a dream, So strangely beautiful ye seem! Or can it be ye shadow forth A creature who hath walked this earth, Sent down from heaven a little while To show how angels look and smile! And, even as one on household stairs Who meets an angel unawares, Might hold his breath; in silent awe I stood when first this Shape I saw Look down with those blue, wondering eyen, Whose brightness seemed to realise My childhood's holiest reveries Of love and innocence divine!— I know thee not; but well my heart Interprets, darling, what thou art: Light of some old ancestral hall, Queen-gem of some proud coronal! For, certes, such a perfect grace, Such lustrous loveliness of face, Such artless majesty as thine Proclaims thee of no sordid line!— And, while my waking dreams I weave Of all thy sweetness, will believe That somewhere ere its pulse is cold Thy living form I may behold; May smooth those locks of rippling gold, See those down-drooping eyes divine Bend their calm summer-light on mine, Hear those moist lips,—that fain would tremble Into smiles, and but dissemble Their quaint air of seriousness,— With music's tenderest tones caress My soul, or lady-laughter, sweet As music! watch those silken feet Flit in the dance, as through the leaves The white moths flit on summer eves, Silent and swift—or, lovelier still, On some free, windy Norland hill, Tread the brown heath in virgin pride! Or, haply, by some brooklet side Glance bare amongst the lilied green, Flushing the waves with rosy sheen! Ah! futile dream! yet not in vain Thou flatterest this weary brain; For gentle thoughts must come, I trow, Where such sweet visitants as thou Have lingered!—And, my gentle child, I bless thy beauty undefiled, That in an hour of sorrow stole Like sunshine on my darkened soul; And pray that, wheresoe'er thou art, Young joy may nestle near thy heart, And sister angels guard thee still From every touch of earthly ill, Folding their stainless pinions round Thy path, to keep it holy ground; While this, thy Shadow, unto me Shall guardian angel ever be! CULLODEN. At last I stand upon thy fatal sod, Drummossie Moor!—and if my eyes are wet, 'Tis not that here the star of Stuart set To rise no more. The righteous hand of God Was on the race, whom nor prosperity, Nor sorrow's holier discipline, could school To this first axiom of true royalty: Who knows to serve, alone deserves to rule. The world could not stand still, that they might play The fool with empire; so they passed. My tears Are not for them, but for the outnumbered Brave Who bled beneath the hirelings' steel that day, And now sleep, rank on rank, in this wide grave, Swathed in the verdure of a hundred years. CAWNPORE. When dawned the promised day-spring from on high, A voice was heard in Ramah: the wild cry Of Rachel weeping for her children slain. Once more the earth hath drunk the precious rain Of Innocent blood!—once more the agony Of desolated hearts assailed the sky! Avenge their cause, O Lord! Yet, not the vain And barren vengeance of a Christless race We imprecate: When from before the face Of outraged heaven and shamed humanity The lightning-sword of Justice shall have swept The Un-nameable—grant that the tears now wept, The martyr-blood now shed into Thy hand, May prove the Chrism of a redeemèd land. Dec. 6, 1857. ROSLIN CHAPEL. In the husht summer noon I stood alone In Roslin's sylvan fane. No sound was heard, Save the far, fitful fluting of one bird, And the low river-voices murmuring on Amid the leaves their faint antiphonies. And here, I said—as fancy backward ranged Through all the dim, tumultuous centuries— For ever through the changing years unchanged, With silence for its guardian angel, stands This wondrous temple, reared by mortal hands, But deckt by hands immortal, as a shrine Sacred to beauty and eternal thought, Where every creed may worship. Touch it not, O man, with impious hands! The house is God's—not thine! May 5, 1861. “THROUGH THE WATERS.” I. Lower and lower sinks the weary moon Towards the vapoury bar. Higher and higher soars the morning star Through the flusht heaven of June. The east grows pale—it will be morning soon! Up through the gusty sound, Each with his glimmering foam-wreath crowned, The ocean waves come ramping, Ramping and rolling with haughty roar, Line after line, in the wan moonshine, Like an army of heroes proudly tramping To death on a hostile shore. And ever the salt winds sob and sigh, And the sheeted spindrift whistles by, Like the voice and the tears of agony. And cold as the breath Of slander or death The balmy midnight air has grown, As I drive fast and free, With the send of the sea, With the long, weary wash of the salt, singing sea— The moon in my white sail, the foam-fire a-lee, In the night of my sorrow—alone. II. Whithersoe'er I fly: 'Mid the loud city's roar, Beside the wild sea-shore, Like mine own shadow still I feel her nigh. Between me and God's light In the blue noon she stands; I feel the hot clasp of her clinging hands In the dead hours of night. The stars of twilight burn With the weird brightness of her eyes; To the sad cadence of her sighs Across the moors the midnight breezes mourn; The innocent flowers of spring That lift their dewy faces in the grass; Sun-gleams that o'er the summer woodlands pass; Brown autumn's fields in silence ripening; The low warm sighs that stir The flowery queaches ere the night comes down; The sylvan odours from the woodland blown, Cedar and beech and fir; The sea-vaults where, 'neath many a quaint festoon Of immemorial moss, the Atlantic waves Chant their wild dirges, as the storm-wind raves Beneath the winter moon: Whate'er of beautiful Earth holds, or wild, or sweet— The very dust beneath my restless feet!— Seems of her being full; As though the unuttered Thought Of her that burns within my tortured soul Had fired insensate matter, and the whole With passionate life were fraught; Till common things, grown strange And startling, ever seem— As in a madman's dream— Quickening with portent of gorgonian change. III. O, earth, that art so fair! With all thy leafy nooks, Valleys and mountain brooks, Hast thou no spot to shield me from despair? O, sea! majestic sea! Hast thou no quiet cave, Where grief might find a grave Unhaunted by the vampire Memory? O, heaven, divine and calm! Hast thou no gentle rain To cool this feverous brain? To soothe this aching heart, no holy balm? O, spirit that dost glow Within me! Sacred spark Of the Eternal Pharos! through the dark, Tempestuous night of error and of woe, Hast thou no ray to guide This shipwrecked life—with all its lofty aims, Ennobling duties, humanising claims, Its passion and its pride? There is no answer—but the gathering roar Of hungry night-winds from their viewless caves, And the remorseless thunder of the waves, Bursting in darkness on an unknown shore! IV. As one who, tottering, on a mountain peak At midnight stands, and, gazing far below, Sees beckoning shapes of horror come and go, Hears luring voices from the abysses shriek; So stand I, dizzy, on the utmost verge Of reason, with bewildered brain, And eyes blind with the fiery rain Of anguish; while a thousand phantoms urge The headlong plunge into the yawning deep Of madness. And were madness death, And death oblivion, I would hold my breath And take the leap! V. A purple splendour swathes the mountain steeps; Slowly night's cloudy cerements are withdrawn; And, as a spirit from the charnel leaps, Leaps up the east the glory of the dawn! Eastward the strong wind bloweth, Eastward the great sea floweth, Eastward the wan haze traileth, Eastward the sea-bird saileth, Eastward the dark earth turneth, Eastward my lone heart yearneth, And eastward, eastward strain my yearning eyes To where, beyond the veil of mist, Stretched like a cloud of faintest amethyst, Headland and valley, crag and shadowy cove, Athwart the track of morn the island lies: The island that I love! And there, ah! there— Peace, burning heart within thy crimson deeps; Thy reign at last is o'er!— Amid the halo of its golden hair The sweet face sleeps; The pale, sweet face, that I shall see no more! VI. But enough of idle gazing In the dead face of The Past! It is Dead. Come, sexton Chronos, Let thy charnel-mould be cast Over what was erst so lovely, Now a cold and ghastly clod. Requiescat! Requiescat! Fill the grave and clap the sod. For I hear Fate's pinions rushing Onward through the waning night, And the trumpets of the future Sounding from the sunward height, And a sovereign voice that calleth Through the breezy morning air: Life is all too brief and precious To be wasted in despair! Man hath other work than weeping! 'Tis with sweat, and not with tears, He fulfils his being's purpose, Reaps the harvest of his years, Builds from passion's burning chaos, With Heaven's order still at strife, Even from error, sin, and shame, The cosmos of Heroic Life. Up, then, up; be strong and earnest, Using life's diminished span To redeem thy youth's fair promise— Bravely, calmly,—even as one Who hath known whate'er of joy Or sadness human heart may know, And cometh, purified for conflict, From the baptism of woe. BOY-LOVE. There is a rose-embowered islet In the ocean of my dreams, Like some crimson cloud of twilight That through ether swims; So bright, so still! and dear to me, Is this halcyon isle of Memory. Yet deem not that I love it so For groves of palm or myrtle bowers, Or limpid streams that ever flow In music through a land of flowers. No! what were scene, however fair, If human love were wanting there! But there the little brown-eyed maid I dare not meet by day, Flits like a bird from shade to shade, And bird-like sings alway, To guide me to the secret nest That nightly screens our linkèd rest. So, ever when the day goes down Into the quiet deep, By hope's delicious breath I'm blown, In the silent bark of sleep, Away, away to this phantom isle, To bask in the light of her gentle smile. FAIRY MADRIGAL. I. Featly, fairies, foot the dance, O'er moss and flower! Through the gloom the fire-flies glance, Like a golden shower; And in their starry light, While the moon yet sleeps behind the hill, Weave we our reel to-night To the chiming of the rill; Or the song the skylark weaves 'Mongst the leaves, As he hymns the dawning gleams In his dreams. II. What, ho! The wisp-fire! Through the dark Follow him fleet, Over the marsh that takes no mark Of our elfin feet. Yo-ho! now hang him out On the foxglove spire for a lamp to be! While round and round about We quaff so merrily, From buttercup and harebell blue, Our nectar-dew, Nor lack from lips divine Sweeter wine! III. Twist we, twist we, twirl and twine Along the green! But see! those rosy streaks that shine The boles between! Mount we the westering wind! Come, follow the track of the twilight grey! We shall leave the morning far behind— To Avalun away! There may our charmèd sleep Be as deep As thine, blue waning moon, In the noon! FIORDESPINA. I 'Twas on a bright and breezy autumn morn, When hill and vale reeled purple-flusht with wine, By immemorial Tiber thou wert born, A creature all divine! Nurst on the breast of Poesy: the child Of ever-young Romance—warm, beautiful, and wild. II No earthly sire was thine, mysterious maiden! Thy dark-eyed mother thridding by the moon Some antique wood with wonder-dreams o'erladen, Lapt in a golden swoon, Like vestal Rhea in the sacred grove, Blest some immortal lover with a mortal's love. III And—when (the sweet moons past) the mellow year, Beloved of Pan, her honeyed fruits brought forth— Dying, amid the sunlight warm and clear, Left thee alone on earth: Alone on earth, a weird, supernal thing, Full of still, trancèd joy and dreamy sorrowing: IV Alone on earth, in virgin majesty Throned where the torch of Eros fears to burn; Like a lone sunbeam o'er a darksome sea, Where'er thy pure eyes turn, Shedding a halo of divinest light, Wherein thou movest veiled in rapture of delight; V An all-embracing aureole of high thought: Shadows from out the past, and wandering gleams Of the evolving future, dimly caught In sleep from saintly dreams: Far-beckoning sympathies with some bright sphere, For which thy spirit yearns with many an unshed tear. VI A sphere where Love and Innocence are one, Where Truth and star-eyed Reason walk assoyled From ban; where Thought undazzled eyes the sun; Where Passion, undefiled By earth, becomes Religion; where to Thee I might become what here, alas! I cannot be. VII She hears me not! but evermore doth speak With low, soft, eager voice; her wide, black eyes Gleam to the stars; her poor unconscious cheek Upon my bosom lies, Fevered and flusht amid the dewy air That laves along my lips the dark tide of her hair. VIII What hear'st thou in the rushing of the river, That thus with trancèd ear thou listenest? What seest thou in those filmy bars that quiver Low in the shadowing west? The Beautiful of old yet live! And thou Dost hold mysterious converse with them even now! IX They float around thee from the sylvan nooks, From out the wide domes of the twilight air; All gentle demons with sweet, wondering looks And forms for ever fair: Phantasms who linger yet by many a shore, Though man's dull eyes behold their beauty now no more. X They float around thee, to thy soul serene, Primeval Truth, on earth forgotten long, Chanting in charmèd numbers; and between The waves of solemn song Trip the rare ether to the silvery tone Of dithyrambic timbrels, heard by thee alone! XI They lure thee hence! And shall we trace no more The leafy caverns of the summer wood! No more together by the midnight shore Hear voices of the flood Muttering to heaven the ancient mysteries Hid in the unresting bosom of the doomful seas! XII No more as now, together, in the soft, Still, odorous darkness of the summer even, Watch pale Silene wander forth aloft Through the wide wastes of heaven, Seeking and finding not—like thee! like me! Like all who breathe the breath of sad mortality! XIII They lure thee hence! Thou fadest from my view! Even while I clasp thee, my belovèd one, Thou fadest from me!—as a tear of dew, Kissed by the wakening sun From off the argent eyelids of the morn, Seeks the blue-vaulted void—ah! never to return! XIV Yes, thou must seek thy native land—to die! And I once more tread life's rough track—alone! Nay! to my spirit thou wilt still be nigh, Though from this bosom flown; Still shine as heretofore, my pilot star, Sphered in the heaven of thought where the immortal are. XV The wandering odours of the vernal wood, The mournful music of the winter sea, The city's roar, the hush of solitude, Shall speak to me of thee! Death cannot part us. In the realm of dreams We yet shall meet and love, whate'er the wise world deems! XVI Then let me kiss the tremor from thy brow, And dry the tears from those wan eyelids starting. Nay, weep not!—why should earthly weakness throw Its shadow on this parting!— Kiss me! Oh, closer, closer!—'tis the last. God keep thee! Morning breaks: our dream of life is past. IDYL. To D. O. H. We tore along with snort and yell, Through barren wastes of mounded sand; Till with a sudden sweep we came Upon the sunlit ocean strand. Dark-blue beneath the dark-blue sky The windless main stretched far away, And here and there the white-sailed ships, Entranced, with long white shadows lay, Still as a dream! But, as the breast Of some sweet sleeper heaves and falls, One long, bright surge along the beach Upheaved and fell at intervals. Such, said I, was the hour, the scene, When Zephyr to the Paphian shore, With Nereid song and winded shell The maiden Aphrodite bore; While all the warm Idalian air Around her flusht with rosy flame, And marble crag and myrtle grove Burst into music as she came! When, lo! as if the whispered words Had realised my shadowy thought, My soul from Nature's bounteous breast Drank of the loveliness it sought: For there, upon the glimmering marge, Between the sea and sea-worn rocks, Stood, mother-naked, in the sun, A little girl with golden locks. Quickly, as if 'twixt shame and fear, Half round she turned with blushful grace, And with a piteous smile threw back The tresses from her glowing face. Then, with a tremulous shriek, she tossed Her rosy, rounded arms in air, While, like a mænad's, backward streamed The lustrous tangle of her hair. With shout on shout, with bound on bound, Aloft she clapt her dimpled hands, And, seaward, with reverted glance, Fled, gleaming, down the gleaming sands. Her white foot touched the silvery foam— One wild, exultant leap she gave, Like the winged fish of Indian seas, And plunged into the coming wave. I saw her glittering form emerge— I heard her breathless laughter ring, One moment! Then once more away Rushed the steam-fiend on murky wing. Once more away! with snort and yell We fled the lone, enchanted spot— But richer—purer, for that draught Of beauty, ne'er to be forgot!— So, let us thank kind Heaven, my friend, Who, if to us it hath refused The golden charm, by knave and fool Possessed so oft—so oft abused— Yet, wielded by the wise and good, That works such blessings in the land— Hath given the clear, perceptive eye, The thoughtful brain to understand— Despite the soul-distracting moil And clangour of this iron age— The runes by God's own finger writ On Nature's ever-open page: The unshrinking reason, that dare track Faith's river to its fountain-springs, And read the lofty meanings hid In what the world calls Common things: The heart to feel the beauty shed O'er all, through all, from Heaven above, And, like that Heaven, to comprehend Creation in one clasp of love. SIR LAUNCELOT. “Had not Sir Launcelot been in his secret thoughts and in his mind set inwardly to the Queen, as he was in seeming outward unto God, there had no Knight passed him in the quest of the Sancgreall.” —La Mort d'Arthur. Past sleeping thorp and guarded tower, By star-gleams and in moonlight pale, By mount and mere, through shine and shower, Flasht the wan lightning of his mail. But loose the jewelled bridle hung, And, backward, listless drooped the spear— God's holy name was on his tongue, Thine in his heart—Queen Guenivere. Deep in a wood at dead of night He felt the white wings winnowing by, He saw the flood of mystic light, He heard the chanting clear and high. “O, heal me, blood of Christ!” he said— A low voice murmured in his ear, And all the saintly vision fled— The voice was thine—Queen Guenivere. Bravest of all the brave art thou— Of guileless heart—of stainless name; But, traitor to thy sacred vow, Thou rid'st to ruin and to shame. No joy on earth for evermore! No rest for thee but on thy bier!— Ah! blessed Lord our sins who bore, Save him—and sinful Guenivere! PAN AND SYRINX. Long, long ago, as poets sing, When earth was in her jocund spring, And passion scarce was crime construed, Old Pan a river-maid pursued Adown green Ladon's valley. Like some flakèd cloud that flies Aloft through breezy April skies, Or sun-gleam o'er the Ionian sea, With fluttring heart and trembling knee, Down Ladon's leafy valley, Fast she fled! while on her track, Ever nearer, like a rack Of lowering thunder-cloud, he strains, Or Ladon mad with mountain rains, Adown his echoing valley. Now athwart the gliding river Their twin shadows flit and quiver— Now the pine wood's odorous night Shrouds awhile their headlong flight Down green Ladon's valley. Now the sunlit meadow-flowers Round their flying feet in showers Of gold and azure fall—and then, In the leaves they're lost again, Adown fair Ladon's valley. Ah! hadst thou been less grisly old, She, perdy, had proved less cold! But despite thy grisly oldness, And despite her froward coldness, Deep in Ladon's valley Thou hadst won thy wish ere long— And who will dare avow 'twas wrong?— Maiden lips have fooled, I trow, Sterner moralists than thou, In many a dewy valley! Ha! he grasps her by the fair Tresses of her streaming hair! In vain she calls!—nor gods on high Nor men below will hear her cry, In Ladon's lonely valley! Yes, huntress of the silver bow! Thou heard'st the virgin's shriek of woe! And vain was all his hungry speed— He clasped a maiden and kissed—a reed, In Ladon's silent valley! SONNET. And is it thus our feverous race we run Through visible life,—that dream within a dream, To death,—that What?—like bubbles on a stream, Bright or obscure, as Fortune's venal sun Flatters or flouts, with arbitrary gleam. Like these, we are not, but do only seem: Mere hollow semblants! Catching, as a mirror, Our hues from circumstance:—or truth, or error— Or gloom, or gaiety. And though, awhile, We may deceive, and win her specious smile, With others, as ourselves, deceitful, vain; What boots it? Will that medicate the pain Of conscious insignificance? and when Life's paltry bubble bursts,—ceases to seem—what then? IN THE FOREST. FRAGMENT. Deep in the cedarn forest stands her bower, Where emerald glooms and golden lights for ever Weave a gay morrice-dance o'er grass and flower— As o'er the ripples of a wavy river The arrowy sun-stars whirl and shoot and shiver; Where the young dryad, Odour, panting flees, Through glade and grove the long midsummer day, Her music-pinioned paramour, the Breeze, Till, faint with lovesome play, They sink asleep, together lapt and folden, Amid the sleeping lilies of a brook, Or couched on mosses, purple, green, and golden, In soome unfooted nook; Where sits the nightingale on hawthorn spray, Witching the dark with lovelorn roundelay, That echoes far the bosky vistas through, With sweet reverberations ever new; Where floats the white moth, from her tremulous wings Thrilling pale radiance, and the small gnat sings A drowsy requiem, ere he sinks to die Under the harebell's drooping canopy; Where, in his blazoned mail, the beetle glides, Thrums the gaunt grasshopper his brazen sides, Through the lush grass the elfin glow-worm gleams, And aye unseen the shrewmouse flits and screams; While, like some bandit o'er his garnered heap, Hidden in mossy cavern, warm and deep, The weary wood-bee hums himself asleep, And overhead, throughout the silent night, The mouldering beech-root looms with weird phosphoric light. SONNET. 'Tis a wild night! The mountain path is rude; The pale stars reel and dance among the clouds That hurry o'er the sky in murky crowds, Like giant Nornir. From the wind-swept wood Owl shrieks to querulous owl. With eiry din Roars through the hollow dark the swollen lyn. The moon steals up above the tossing pines: Wan as a dying charnel-lamp it shines, Making the night more drear. But what to me Or storm or darkness! Onward joyously I toil—as toils a lone bark tempest-driven For shore, or weary soul for rest in heaven: On through the gloom with fond eye fixed on thee, My happy haven! my blest eternity! CIRCE. Like some poor wretch in mortal fever, Fitfully with vague endeavour, Maniac shout and idiot weeping, Ossas on dim Pelions heaping, To storm—alas! he knows not what Olympus of fantastic thought; So, with blind rage and frantic wailing, Writhes in travail unavailing This Briarean world of ours, This maëlstrom of contending powers, This seething mass of human will, Of love, of hate, of good, of ill, Of courage calm and headlong terror, Humble truth and haughty error, Doubt and faith, and pride and shame, Kisses, curses, praise, and blame, Pale disease and rosy health, Pinched poverty and bloated wealth, Youth and dotage—one and all, Round this corpse-incrusted ball Pursuing some imagined Good, In a sweat of tears and blood: Pleasure—Fortune—Freedom—Fame— What is either but a name! Let them battle, let them rave, From the go-cart to the grave! What to Us is all the stir, Rosy-lipped philosopher! Thy keen-edged laughter—like the sword Of Macedon's impetuous lord— Hath cleft in twain the stubborn cord Heart-knotted round my high resolves, And all youth's daring dream dissolves! No more I yearn amid the throng To work my will with sword or song: To shield the helpless—beard the strong, And, armed with right, to vanquish wrong. Still may weak laws degrade the poor, And patriots cozen them, secure From retribution. Still remain The poor deserving of their chain— Oh! Slavery! this thy foulest stain!— Still may their own hands fabricate Fresh fetters to perpetuate Their degradation. Let them toil, Despairing helots, on the soil Which is their birthright. Never more May comfort guard the poor man's door, When frost bites keen and chill winds roar— Nor joy sit smiling by his hearth— What right hath poverty to mirth? Let vice and infidelity Still rot men's souls from sea to sea, While Mother Church with tranquil face Sits throned aloof in pride of place, Intoning low with courtly ease Her stately platitudes; nor sees, Nor hears where, struggling in the night Of ignorance, they cry for light, For food, for love,—but cry in vain: Her spotless lawn she must not stain By contact with the godless rout Who dare to hunger—and to doubt! Let selfishness, that monster-birth Of sin and fear, still rule the earth, As heretofore, with iron rod— Man's only universal god! Some stronger arm must strike the blow That lays sin's loathly hydra low; Must take the sting from poverty, And, in the truth, make mankind free! Mine be a gentler task: afar From din of life's heart-sickening jar, Lost in the magic maze of love Beneath thy whispering woods to rove, And dedicate my days to thee— Henceforth my sole divinity! No more ambition's “foolish fire,” That drags the great world through the mire— Smirching so many a robe of pride, Shall lure me, Circe, from thy side; Her richest meed were lost on one Who lives but for thy smile alone! Still less shall vulgar lust of pelf Rob me of thee—and of myself, Pollute my spirit, freeze the springs Of joy, and clip young fancy's wings,— I'll leave it to earth's creeping things! Those human scarabs who would rake Gehenna's foulness for its sake; Then, having found some golden grains, Wax straightway orgillous—like drains In thaw—strut forth with horn erect, And, blushless, claim the world's respect; As though, God help them! they had done Some noble thing beneath the sun, And not—the sort of work designed For creatures of the scarab kind! Dearer this dimpled hand to fold Thus close in mine, than all the gold O'er which Pactolus ever rolled! Sweeter to hear Thee breathe my name Thus low, than all the blatant fame, For which mankind have ever given Their peace on earth, their hope of heaven! Nor would I for her proudest wreath Forego those locks, that in thy breath Wave odorous as they downward flow In sunshowers from thy shadowy brow, And weave a halo round my head More glorious far than fame could shed! I have no life apart from thine; No hope beyond Thee, witch divine! The future now hath nought to give For which I would not scorn to live, Beyond thy love! Thus lost in Thee, Even life itself hath ceased to be Aught but a solitary sense Of passion's crowned omnipotence! AGNELLINA. Come hither, little brown-eyed maid, And lean upon my breast, And lay thy soft young cheek to mine, That my spirit may have rest. For I am sick of woman's love, So fickle, froward, wild, And with strange yearning turn to thine, Thou blameless little child! O, were it sooth the legend tells Of that mysterious tree, Which whoso tasteth straight returns To blissful infancy, With pilgrim staff and sandal shoon I'd search the wide world round, Nor rest till, wheresoe'er it grew, The magic fruit were found. Ah! hopeless dream! Yet while I feel Thy joyous bosom beat Against my weary heart, and drink Thy kisses calm and sweet, The fiery worm of memory sleeps, My soul forgets her pain, And in the smile of heaven I walk With thee—a child again. EREME. Roaming about the woods at eventide, Singing as sang the birds i' the leafy bowers, Deep in a grove a flowerlike babe I 'spied Sleeping serenely on a couch of flowers. Breathless, by turns each dewy-folded lid I kissed—his mouth, his cheeks, his forehead fair; While round him, all a-blush, my arms I slid, And shook a shadow o'er him with my hair. And then, as one, who in a lonely place Hath found a priceless gem he dreads to lose, Doth turn on every side his fearful face, And starting fleëth, although none pursues; So in my robe I wrapped my new-found treasure, With many a stealthy glance and quick caress; And bore him, trembling with the sweet, strange pleasure, Into my chamber's warm and husht recess. What joy it was, bending above him there, To watch his honeyed breathing ebb and flow, To touch the rounding of his shoulders fair, To smooth his pinions' rosy-tinctured snow! And when he turned him in his sleep and smiled, What blissful madness flooded all my brain! With fancies vague and beautiful and wild Flattering my heart and flushing every vein; Till, with my hot cheek pillowed on his breast, Ambrosial darkness of the summer night Lapped my faint spirit in enchanted rest, Deeper than slumber, sweeter than delight. Ai! ai! that in that transport I had died! Or died ere yet that transport I had known! For when the morning dawned my arms were void, My love-warmed nest a-cold, my sweet bird flown! And not a sign save only this remained, To tell where in my bosom he had slept!— Whereat the poor soul from her azure-veined And milky side the peplos drew, and wept: For lo! where swells the bosom's balmy round, Full-orbed above the clasping gold—Ah me! A barbèd shaft had ript a teenful wound, A bitter wound, that bled full cruelly. And so, she said, I sit and nurse my pain, Here, a lone, wounded dove, in forest shade, Waiting, if haply he will come again: For love alone can heal the wound that love hath made. MOONLIGHT: A FRAGMENT. Day sinks at last behind the purple hills, And silence wraps the land. Here, gentle friends, Let's nestle in the fresh-piled aftermath, And watch the quiet coming of the moon. Already from the zenith's dim abyss Her starry harbingers peer forth—then vail Their cressets. Hesperus alone, wide-eyed, Through fairy isles of amethyst and gold, Swims up the ebbing radiance of the west With blazing torch to meet her. And lo! she comes, Enchantress-queen of shadows, of pale dreams, Of passionate yearnings—madness and despair; Yet, see! how tranquilly she smiles, adown The roseate summer dark; her silvery veil Uplifting,—like the heaven-descended one Who stood revealed in virgin majesty To care-worn Dante by the mystic bourn, What time the quires angelic chanted, “Come, My Bride, from Lebanon,” and angelic hands Rained lilies gathered at the feet of God! How beautiful, how beautiful thou art! O pilgrim orb!—with fond imploring face Turned ever as thou journeyest, Clytie-like, Towards the golden shrine thou ne'er canst win: Bright with the light of everlasting love, Wan with the shadow of eternal woe! DIRTY WEATHER. Moaneth ever the weary wind, Pelteth ever the rain; The grey sky lowereth, The sear wood roareth, The red river poureth Down to the main. O'er cornfield and fallow, O'er headland and shallow, The white mist is trailing, The sea-birds are sailing, And shrieking and wailing In pain. With a bruise on her back, And slime in her track, Slowly and wearily over the road The weak worm is crawling; And, heavily sprawling Through the wind-battered reeds, Through the rain-rotten weeds, Through the leprous and rich- Bubbling scum of the ditch, Croaketh and choketh the crapulous toad. With shock upon shock, And a deep under-thunder, On the black, dripping rock, The black billows sunder, And churn their blind bulk into yeast,— As a beast, Blind with terror and rage, On the bars of his cage Dashes out his brute life with a wild howl of wonder. With sigh upon sigh From a heart sick with sadness; With tear-jaundiced eye, And a brain wrung to madness With care, and the strife Between higher and lower Within me; while life, Flowing slower and slower, Seems to stagnate and rot,— Here I sit—a mere blot On the page of creation— No rare case, God wot!— With weak ululation Bewailing my lot; While nation to nation, Of freedom and glory and knowledge and love Is chanting in thunder-loud chorus, above The wild clang of battle, where, trampled in blood, Roll crowns and tiaras;—and on at the flood Sweeps the clear wave of Progress. On, on may it sweep Till the Christ-ransomed millions of earth from the sleep Of ignorance, vice, and oppression shall leap— From lazar and dungeon, full-armed in the might Of their God-moulded manhood—and hurl into night The fetters that bound them, The cerements that wound them, Soul, body, and brain. And abroad—to a strain Of such music as rang When the universe sprang Into being—the bright flag of Freedom shall wave O'er a new world that knows neither bigot nor slave! Hillo! there's a collier got crippled!—I see: 'Tis her fore-tackle. Up she has swung, and a-lee Goes heavily drifting right into the bay, Her dirty rags flapping in fog-mist and spray; Her bandy-legged, cockle-eyed ‘skip,’ I should say, 'S in a bit of a mess; for they don't seem to know There's a sandbank out there—and the tide's getting low. Well, no doubt it's a bore—but, of course, I must go And see if I can't lend the fellows a hand, Should they come—which is likely—as flotsam to land. ALONE. 'Twas eve; the level sunlight fell Athwart the distant ocean-swell, And like a wreath of glory lay Along the ripples of the bay, That, curling inwards to the greener strand, Died in a starry gush along the golden sand. No thing of earthly mould was nigh, Save one lone skylark, trancedly Hymning up the cloudless sky, On the wings of his own wild melody. No other sound,—save when the breeze Sighed in the solemn chestnut trees, Or stirred the spear-grass by my side,— Answered the whispers of the tide; And over all, like guardian spirit, shone Eve's “bright particular star,” all lovely and alone! I gazed upon the glimmering bay, I gazed into the tranquil sky, I heard the skylark's roundelay, I saw the waves glide glittering by, I felt the low winds round me sigh, And to my weary spirit said: Why linger still beside the dead? Look forth from out thy living grave, Nor longer—freeborn—be the slave Of misery. No longer pine For happiness—already thine, If thou but choose to look abroad Upon the workmanship of God! I seek the Beautiful, it sighed— It is around thee, I replied: Look forth into this glorious eve, But once look forth, and thou wilt own No sentient thing hath room to grieve, Whate'er betide. With inward moan It answered—Am I not alone? ARIADNE: FOUR SKETCHES FROM THE ANTIQUE. I. He left her weeping on the Naxian shore, And homeward with triumphant garlands bore. Through blinding tears she watched his lessening sail, And the sun burning on his brazen mail. Blent with the thunders of the hoary deep, Blent with the salt wind's wail, as if in sleep, She heard his voice grow fainter, as he trod The sounding deck victorious, like a god! She heard the rowers singing as they rowed; She saw the fluttering sheen of Ægle's veil; She heard her laughter on the freshening gale, And shrieked. Well, Ariadne! may'st thou mourn: The perjured ingrate never will return. Another bosom,—ah! less fair than thine!— Shall pillow his proud head beyond the brine; Another brow the Athenian crown shall share, And other arms his Attic children bear!— But still she gazed, and still, with claspèd hands Outstretched to Delos, knelt upon the sands, Till daylight died among the Cyclades, And darkness gathered o'er the desolate seas. II. Smiles over all an azure-vaulted clime,— The wandering airs breathe odour of the rose, Thick-fallen fir-cones, moss, and dewy thyme, Blent with the cool wind from the sea that blows. Scattering the stars, the Olympian charioteer His beamy front upreareth; silently His cloud-borne coursers urge their steep career Up the rath purple of the eastern sky. Through the long grass—o'er the awakening flowers— Up the grey boles of cedar, beech, and pine, His golden splendours slant in arrowy showers, Or, snake-like, leap and twine. And hark! from far the greenwood alleys ring With sistrum, cymbal, flute, and twangling string, With pipe and timbrel and Iacchic shout! Io! evoè! ho! In motley rout Through the deep umbrage, forth into the gleam Of morn, the frolic feres of Evan stream! Here the lithe Indian, nursling of the sun, Wreathing bright snakes about his shoulders dun, Comes leaping. There, with smilax garlanded, The Mænad tosses her delirious head; Now the brown Satyr thumps the rooty ground With horny heel to Syrinx' liquid sound; Now the young Oread's milky beauties shine 'Neath emerald shadows of the liberal vine; Now, by two sinewy Sylvans borne on high, Flushed with the god the Lesbian sage comes by, Chanting old ditties of Titanic wars, Thrumming his can, and winking at the stars That linger yet aloft—his joyous brow, Fresh twined with lustrous ivy, all a-glow! While high o'erhead blushes the grape divine, Heavy with unborn wine! III. Still as a stone, and pallid as a flower Reft by sharp Eurus from Aurora's bower, Under a marble cliff that guards the bay, Her dark locks heavy with the midnight spray, Alone the love-lorn Ariadne lay. She sleeps!—but still her burning cheeks are wet, For in her dreams she mourns her Theseus yet; Nor hears the blue-eyed daughters of the main Weave their wild songs to soothe her deathly pain. IV. Who in his purple chariot, panther-drawn, Bursts through the revel, glorious as the dawn— His dancing hair with tender vine-leaves crowned, His rosy feet with golden sandals bound? Athwart his ivory shoulders, backwards blown By his own speed, a pard's light spoils are thrown; In his soft hand the wreathèd thyrsus gleams, And from his dark, bold eye the godhood beams! Io! evoè! ho!—'Tis he! 'tis he! Bacchus, the white-armed son of Semele! Wake, Ariadne! On the billowy strand He bends above thee, and with gentlest hand Smooths thy dank hair and breathes o'er cheek and brow, As breathes the spring o'er winter's waste of snow; Breathes until once again the roses bud and blow! Wake, Ariadne! Night hath past away With all thy sorrow. See! the joyous Day Comes dancing o'er the eastern foam. Arise, And shame him with the glory of thine eyes; They were not made for tears, nor this white breast for sighs! Wake, Ariadne! by thy slumbering side Lyæus kneels, and woos thee for his bride; With him to roam from sunny shore to shore, A proud and peerless queen the wide world o'er; Wake, Ariadne, wake!—be loved! and weep no more! MONODY. The drifted rain is pelting, The sodden snow-wreaths melting; Leafless boughs are creaking To the night-wind's doleful shrieking; The river runs below, With stilly-gurgling flow, Like the stifled breath of woe: Well-a-day! Wealth—honour—what are they? Delusive lights that play Around the dead heart's grave! Better, methinks, to have Children to climb our knees, Love's cares and charities, Than hollow mocks like these: Well-a-day! Affection—quiet—health, The wise man's truest wealth, And hast thou sold them all To buy—a Funeral! To gild a lonely bier That stranger hands must bear, Unhallowed by love's tear, To the clay! WINTER. Dead asleep the old earth lies, Happed about with mounded snow; The wan moon low to westward dies; The bitter night-winds shrilly blow. With muffled beat of horses' feet, That echo songs of long ago, Through desert wold, through village street, From dark to dark we onward go. So toils my life from dark to dark, Toils onward, wearily and slow; No star above its course to mark, Nor any haven of rest below. As one may weep in frenzied sleep O'er his own form in death laid low, My heart doth tearful vigil keep By her own grave in trancèd woe. DIRGE. In mine ear a death-bell ringeth, And a sad voice ever singeth: Time is speeding on his way; Night treads on the skirts of day; All things hasten to decay; Old years revive not; glory cannot shed Sunshine around the heart when golden youth is fled. The Past is dead. The Present dies In birth. The faithless Future flies Us ever: as in dreams we see Some bright-robed, beauteous phantom flee, Yet court pursuit—till suddenly In some lone spot she turns, and we unfold A crumbling corpse obscene, or night-hag grisly old. WAR-SONG. 1854. I Ha! once again O'er land and main Our battle-flag is flying! Ha! once again Our freeborn men In Freedom's cause are dying! The grand old Lion's up once more, True to his kingly nature; Come not between him and his prey, Slave, coward, fool, or traitor! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! The Old Land's true as ever! No despot's foot shall trample Us, Or those who trust us—Never! II Have recreants said Our hearts are dead To justice and to glory? Cried “Stand aloof!” Though Russia's hoof In Europe's blood wax gory? Theirs be their country's hate and scorn Through all the coming ages! Well have they plied their trade of shame— 'Tis right they have their wages! But, Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Our hearts are true as ever! No despot's foot shall tread on Us, Or those who trust us—Never! III But tears must fall, In hut and hall, For loved ones unreturning,— High hearts and brave, Who bled to save The land from deeper mourning! They bled!—we weep!—But in our task Sublime, we dare not falter: To guard from shame the sacred flame On Freedom's glorious altar! No—No!—Hurrah! Hurrah! The Old Land's true as ever! God's arm of might will shield the right! Then strike! This hour—or Never! IV Yes, though we weep For those who sleep By Alma's doleful water, And those who died In that wild ride Of unavailing slaughter, Still we exult; for in our veins The same free blood is bounding! And east or north we'll pour it forth, Where'er the charge is sounding! Then, Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! The Old Land's true as ever! No despot's foot shall trample Us, Or those who trust us—Never! THE TOMB IN THE CHANCEL. TO W. H. P. I Up from the willowy Wharfe the white haze crept, The yellow leaves were falling one by one, When through the Priory nave we softly stept To where—his clangorous life-moil long since done— Sir Everard Raby in his hauberk slept, In the still chancel corner, all alone. Ah! time had used him roughly! Helm and shield All banged and battered, as in mortal field; The knightly baldric brast, the brave sword gone That won his spurs at dusty Ascalon! But broken harness or dishonoured crest, Boots not to him so meekly slumbering there, With stony feet crossed in eternal rest, And stony finger locked in everlasting prayer. II The autumn sunlight touched his carven mail With ghostly radiance—cyclas, belt, and lace; Scattered wan splendours all about the place, And with fantastic necromancy played Amongst the dust our quiet moving made; While o'er his suppliant hands and heavenward face It hung a mournful glory, soft and pale, As if, through mist of half-remembered tears, It shone from far, the light of buried years!— We leaned in silence on the oaken rail, And, 'mid the hush, this thought swelled like a psalm In my heart's sanctuary: O that we, too, might bear Our cross through life's stern conflict, as to wear In death, like him, the crown of everlasting calm. SUMMER WIND. Soul of blue summer! cool-winged Psyche! thou Who, stealing through the roses, on my brow Printest an odorous kiss, and then art gone! Would that unbodied I might fly with thee Where'er thou fliest. Then what ecstasy Were mine, in forests wandering, green and lone; By woodland tarn; by willowy, winding stream, Where lotus-buds lie, tranced in shadowy dream, On their smooth fronds, the long voluptuous day; Or haply, where at eve the hoary sea Swims with broad bosom up some quiet bay, Under the haunted crags of Sicily, What time the white-limbed Nereids, hand in hand, Dance to the Cyclops' piping o'er the dimpled sand. AUTUMN WIND. Blow thy wild clarion o'er the darkening wold, Weird Autumn Wind, for thou art conqueror! And, like a conqueror, robed in purple and gold, Dost ride triumphing. At thy tyrannous blore Pomona quakes, and to appease thy wrath Scatters her garnered glories in thy path. Queen Ceres bows with earthward trailing hair Before thee. At the rattling of thy wheels Strong Faunus moans, and bends beneath them, bare Of all his verdurous honours. Bromius reels, To do thee boisterous homage, from his car, Red from the laughing vintage. While from far Poseidon shouts to swell the brave uproar, And strews with votive wrecks the loud-resounding shore. THE SONG OF SILENUS. FIRST SKETCH FOR A PICTURE. (Virg. Buc. Ecl. vi.) I Sing, O Pierides! how, on the ground, These frolic children of Arcadian Pan Deep in a cave the quaint Silenus found, Heavy with sleep, beside his well-worn can. The wreaths wherewith last night the Nymphs had crowned The fervid brows of the divine old man Lay strewn about; with these they bound eftsoon, And bore him sleeping forth into the azure noon. II Upon a hillock, mossy-soft and green, They set him down to catch th' Ægean breeze, When forth with laughter from her sedgy screen Leapt Ægle, fairest of the Naiades, And, as the Lesbian ope'd his wildered een, Plucked, tiptoe-poised, a branch of mulberries, And, kneeling, daubed his brow and temples grey, While prone in leafy gyves he unresisting lay. III Pleased with the deed—more with the doer pleased— Lowly he laughed. Then to the Sylvans cried, “What means this bondage? Wherefore am I seized Thus impiously? Enough that ye have eyed A god asleep!”—“The song—and thou'rt released,” They answered, “promised oft and long denied!” “Unbind me, then!” 'Twas done; and from his can, Grape-filled anew by Ægle, quaffing, he began. IV “The song for you,” he said; “for her I'll find Another recompense!”—Then forth he threw His voice euphonious to the listening wind, That bore it far the echoing forest through, Till the broad oaks their stubborn heads inclined, And Satyrs, Oreads, Fauns—a motley crew— From rock and thicket, glade and grove, advance, Weaving around the spot their wildly-measured dance. V Not more rejoices the Castalian rock In Phœbus; not old Rhodope the frore In him whose love-lorn numbers did unlock The gates of Dis, and from the Stygian shore Won back Eurydice—(ah, bitter mock! Twice lost—and lost at last for evermore, Through too much love)—than in his honeyed voice The listening woods and all the woodland feres rejoice! VI He sang the dawn of Nature—mystic theme!— How, from the chaos of primeval night, Robed in bright billows—beauteous as a dream— The virgin earth leapt laughing into light, And bared her genial bosom, all a-gleam With flowers, as Helios in his joy and might, From the vast caverns of the eternal void, Sprang forth on burning plumes and clasped her as his bride. VII He sang of gods and heroes: how the sire Of Zeus had kinged it in the world's fair prime; Of haught Prometheus, by the Thunderer's ire Stretched lone on Caucasus; the impious crime Of Atalante, and the sufferings dire Of the young Heliads; then the mournful rhyme Of Tireus chants and tongueless Philomel, And gentle Scylla curst by Circe's cruel spell. VIII The loves of Zeus and Semele he sang: How Dionysus of the wondrous birth, With Lydian flutings and the silvery clang Of cymbals, rode a-conquering through the earth; How, where he trode, the clustered vine up-sprang, And haggard care danced hand in hand with mirth; How peerless Ariadne won his love, And swart Agave raged in the Cadmean grove. IX Up from the Ægean swept the salt sea-breeze, And shook the white locks round his glowing brow; Then sang he how the blue-eyed boys of Greece Launched the swift ship, and drove with venturous prow To realms of wonder, far o'er unknown seas, And back, triumphing, from its sacred bough, By many a haunted isle and alien shore, The golden trophy home to dear-loved Helas bore. X Of fate, of love, of heaven-sent poesy He sang, till Phœbus from his sloping car Leaned back to hear; and through the boughs on high The large-eyed Vesper gazed, all loth to bar The stream of song. But now the plaintive cry Of flocks, from darkening wolds, proclaimed afar The folding hour. He ceased, and down a glade, Amid the deepening shadows, vanished like a shade. KING GOLDIMAR. I Between the setting of the sun And rising of the evening star, Deep in the greenwood glade alone She met King Goldimar. A milk-white steed he lightly strode, With jewelled falchion at his knee, With golden casque and golden spur, And graith of samite, fair to see: And thus he rode to win her love, From Avalun, the fays' countree. II He louted low from saddle bow, He breathed into the maiden's ear; And in the silence of the wood Her heart stood still to hear! He swung her deftly up on steed; He gave her charmèd kisses three: Says, “Golden crown for locks of gold, Sweet Ladye, an thou wend with me;”— And forth into the night they rode To Avalun, the fays' countree. NARCISSUS: A FRAGMENT. He strode apart in youthful pride, His clustered locks on either side Danced down upon his shoulders wide— The beautiful Narcissus. His belted bosom full and fair Gleamed out beneath his gleaming hair, His lordly length of limb was bare— The hunter-boy Narcissus. Athwart his broad back, bow and quiver In the sunlight glance and shiver, As, adown the forest river, Passed the young Narcissus: By brattling swift and slumbering pool, Shadowed by alders green and cool, A form divinely beautiful— The hunter-boy Narcissus. For him the nut-brown Dryad grieves, Deep hidden in her bower of leaves, For him on musky summer eves— The beautiful Narcissus— The Naiads quit their glaucous flocks To sing about the glimmering rocks, Or trip the sand with floating locks For haughty-eyed Narcissus. For him pale Echo weeps apart— Her cold hand on her burning heart— She cannot tell her cureless smart, O hunter-boy Narcissus! But when she hears his bugle-horn Far-winding in the dewy morn, She shrieks aloud—he laughs in scorn! The beautiful Narcissus. THRENODY. The spider in the jasmine leaves, Her fairy web of silver weaves; All round the breezy cottage eaves I hear the busy swallows: The bee hums round his mossy door, The stream flows on with joyous roar, The starry ripples race ashore Across the gleaming shallows. Sheep are bleating, kine are lowing, Children shouting, barn-fowl crowing, Winds athwart the mountains blowing Waves of shine and shadow: To their lightsome labour bound The merry reapers, autumn-browned; And the dripping wheel goes round, By the mill-dams in the meadow. Like living chords of one great lyre, Swept by a seraph's plumes of fire, Like voices of one mighty choir Blent in one psalm of gladness, All things rejoice; my heart, alone Discordant, yields no joyous tone, But one dull, inarticulate moan, One weary wail of sadness. Even as a blasted tree may stand, All leafless in a summer-land, In vain by genial breezes fanned, By shower and sunshine haunted; So, sunned by all the warm delight Of this young day—so purely bright— I stand in darkness, by the might Of Memory enchanted. I see the infinite loveliness Of God's fair universe—can bless His creatures in their blessedness, Despite my own heart's aching: But never more my soul may know The thrill of sympathy, the glow Of love that stirred it long ago, In youth's divine upwaking. “MY LADY.” I 'Twas a stately English maiden, Proud of step and calm of mien, With a red mouth like a rosebud, And the bosom of a queen, II That far down the summer woodland, Culling flowers, had lost her way When we met among the brackens At the closing of the day. III Never lovelier vision wandered, In the young world's age of gold, Through green Tempe's bowers elysian, Or Hesperian gardens old. IV Ne'er to lonely knight of later Ages, bound on perilous quest Through enchanted forest, sweeter Witch or woman stood confest. V Ne'er through royal Shakespeare's pages, Or strong Chaucer's pulsing line, Or pure Spenser's crystal stanzas, Floated phantom so divine! VI But, diviner than all phantoms Of the teeming poet-brain; Youth, like a sweet breeze, about her; Life a-glow in every vein!— VII Life, that through her very garments Seemed to palpitate and burn, Like a mystic flame that flushes Through an alabaster urn: VIII Till the very dust she trode on With her silent silken feet, And the air her quickened breathing Made so strangely, wildly sweet, IX Took a glory from her presence, As a wreath of vapour dun Turns to amethyst and beryl In the presence of the sun! X O! those dark locks, ever darkening With the darkening of the even! O! those bright eyes, ever brightening As the stars grew bright in heaven! XI O! those whispers, like the night-wind— Through my brain they vibrate yet! Syllables of magic import, To the heart's deep music set! XII O! that purple July gloaming! O! that husht and shadowy nook, Where, alone with that sweet sibyl, First I conned love's mystic book!— XIII Where young passion's nectared vintage First allayed my soul's fierce drouth— Crushed from out the ruby wine-press Of that warm and loving mouth! XIV Lady, when the summer twilight Swoons to earth in violet gloom, When the warm winds panting round thee Wave their censers of perfume; XV When the blackbird in the beeches Calls his mate with doubling note, And the young moon's shadow trembles Where the water-lilies float; XVI When the far-off kine are lowing, And the village forge is mute, And the long, dim valley echoes To the lovelorn herdsman's flute; XVII When the milkmaid's laugh replieth, From the quiles of new-mown hay, And broad Hesper through the deepening Umbrage darts a fierier ray; XVIII When the summer's dreamy languor Creeps through every nerve and vein, Till its very sweetness thrills thee With a sense of mortal pain; XIX As that haughty bosom, aching, Owns the witchery of the hour, And thy heart throbs void and weary In thy lone palatial bower, XX And the golden robe of honour Seems to swathe thee like a pall, And like lead upon thy forehead Weighs the golden coronal: XXI Then, will yearning memory conjure Back that night of joy and tears, When we gathered love's wild roses In the spring-time of our years? DEAD. The seasons weave their ancient dance, The restless ocean ebbs and flows, The world rolls on through day and dark, Regardless of our joys or woes! Still up the breezy western slopes The reaper girls, like apples brown, Bend singing to their gleeful toil, And sweep the golden harvest down: Still, where the slanting sunlight gilds The boles of cedar and of pine, Chants the lone blackbird from the brake With melancholy voice divine: Still all about the mossy tracks Hums at his darg the wood-ward bee; Still fitfully the corn-crake's note Comes to me from the upland lea: Still round the forest bower she loved, The woodbine trails its rich festoons; The slumbrous poppies burst and fall Beneath the silent autumn moons. Still round her lattice, perched aloof, In sunny shade of thatchèd eaves, The jasmine clings, with yearning pale, And withers in its shroud of leaves: Still round the old familiar porch Her cherished roses blush and peer, And fill the sunny air with balm, And strew their petals year by year. Nor here within, one touch of change! The footstool—the embroidered chair— The books—the arras on the wall— The harp—the music—all are there. No touch of change! I close my eyes— It cannot be she comes no more! I hear the rustling of her dress; I hear her footstep on the floor; I feel her breath upon my brow; I feel her kiss upon my cheek:— Down, phantoms of the buried past! Down, or my heavy heart must break. AN EXHORTATION. Keep thy spirit calm and pure, How fierce soe'er the storm may rise; Stand thou in the truth secure 'Mid surge of hate and spume of lies. The darker night, the brighter day!— Though maniac curse and idiot sneer, The clouds will roll themselves away, And leave thy heaven serene and clear. But, dark or clear, have thou no fear! Hold on thy course with trustful eye! Steer for the light in hell's despite, Nor doubt that He thou serv'st is nigh! SONG. I Fair star that shinest On the front of even, With a light divinest Of the stars of heaven, Hesper! to thee this night of nights my orisons be given! To thee who bringest all things good, Who bring'st the rosy hour Warm-blushing up the western flood, That leads me to her bower. Over the billows my bonny boat merrily go! The white foam sings under our lee, in our white sail the wind murmurs low, As we drive down the soft summer dark, like a sea-bird on pinions of snow. II Sea and sky were gleaming In the cloudless noon; Fold on fold the hills lay dreaming In an azure swoon; Wold and woodland throbbed with song, and breathed the balm of June! But my soul was weary of the splendour, Weary of bird and flower, And sighed for night, the dark and still and tender, To lead me to her bower. Over the billows my bonny boat gallop and go! She is waiting us under the rock in the shell-paven cove that we know, Where the ivy-trail stirs not a tendril, how rudely soever it blow. III From the pine-crowned mountain Forth into the night, Like a welling fountain Wells the glad moonlight, Flushing all the starry gulfs with new and strange delight! So the long gloom of lonely years Crowned love's majestic power Makes glorious, as the warm wind bears Me onward to her bower! Hush! 'Tis her soft-falling foot on the shadowy shore, Like the lisp of a wavelet! She comes, in the glow of her beauty, once more!— Rest thee, my bonny boat, rest thee till morning: our voyage is o'er! HYMN TO APHRODITE. I Goddess of the golden hair, Blue-eyed Aphrodite! Fair Daughter of the Idalian foam! Whether beneath the skyie dome Of old Olympus, or the shade Of Ida's many-whispering glade, Where upon thy milky breast Young Anchises— Nay! the rest, An thou blushest, shall remain Secret;—or beside the main, Which around thy Paphian shore Pæans thee with joyous roar, Thou dost wander, O! supremely fair! Accept those votive wreaths, and hearken to my prayer! II I have crowned each altar-horn With young roses; I have borne, From the marge of Hippocrene, Myrtle branches dewy-green; I have heaped thy baskets o'er With Pomona's honeyed store; I have brought thee pigeons, white As those sister-spheres of light, 'Neath thy dimpled hand concealed In vain—by their own pride revealed; By them, and by thy limbs of snow, By thy lip and cheek and brow, By thy upwreathed locks that scent the wind, O! hear my prayer, and aid; for Myrrha is unkind! III I have sung my love in strains That might have thawed the rocky veins Of Scylla—poor lost Scylla! She Less cruel to Glaucus, than to me Dark-eyed Myrrha! Every art Have I tried to win her heart: Now the distaff I have plied, Silken-seated by her side; Now bestrode the panting steed; Guided now the lightning speed Of the chariot; round her brow Wreathed my hard-won olive bough; Wept and prayed;—but all, alas! in vain; Laughing, she flies me still. I die of her disdain! IV Night and morn she proudly sings, Smiling through the golden strings Of her dædal-carven lyre, Till my soul is lapt in fire: “What is Venus, sparrow-borne? Myrrha laughs her power to scorn! What is Eros? What is he, His wild-eyed brother deity? What their boasted torch and bow? And what, fond Theon, what art thou? What were life, and freedom gone? Myrrha still shall be her own!” By the last kiss thy lost Adonis gave, Hear, Cytheræa, hear! avenge thy suppliant slave! V Love is wingèd. Mine hath flown, Leaving hate his vacant throne! Let the haughty beauty know Unrequited passion's woe! Let no gentle slumber bring Respite to her sorrowing! Fill her frozen veins with flame, Drown in love her maiden shame! Bring, insulted deity! Bring her suppliant to thy knee. I shall laugh to see her come, Oh, how altered! trembling, dumb. How I shall spurn her! Sweet revenge!—Nay, nay! But clasp her to my heart, and kiss her soul away! NONSENSE. Shed not for me, love, the blood of the vine, No wreaths of her emerant ringlets twine; Pull not the roses: let us believe A beautiful spirit unseen doth live In the odorous depths of every flower, That loveth, as we love, the sun and the shower! That loveth, as we love, the summer breeze, The song of birds and the hum of bees! Whose subtile veins may throb and glow With a fervour which only spirits know For spirits;—or I, who have long been free Of the spirit-world, may feel for thee, Who hast only clay enough about Thy soul, to keep me still in doubt If thou, indeed, be child of earth, Or creature of aërial birth: Descended, haply, even from him Who in the midnight, starry-dim, Like a rich moonbeam softly crept To where, in magic trance, she slept, The Dark-Ladye who Merlin bore In lone Dimatian tower of yore!— Then pull not the flowers! let them bud and blow, Nod and beck and gaze their fill On their shadows mirrored in the still, Clear water of the fountain pool That, bright and cool, Smiles below, With vague leaves paven and glimmering bells, And clustered round with asphodels. But give me kisses!—a sweeter wine Fills those red, grape-like lips of thine, Than ever “sparkled in Sansovine.” Yet, while one drinks, 'Tis meet, methinks— As the Tean singeth—a wreath to wear; Then a garland wreathe me, my dark-eyed queen! But not of the vine leaves, crimson or green! Nor of flowers how fair Or sweet soe'er,— But the scented locks of thy night-black hair Around my temples twine! Nor touch ye the cithern string! Wake not the wild, sad spirits that dwell In the echoing vault of the ivory shell! Let them sleep: They wake but to weep And wander lorn on weary wing! Wailing ever with piteous breath, Like troubled souls for the calm of death. From silence they come, to silence go; And all they yearn for, none may know. But this we rede from their voice of woe: They pray for peace. Then let them sleep On their folded plumes. O, blest as deep, In the echoing vault of the ivory shell, Must the slumber be that they love so well! But press to mine thy dusky cheek, And breathe “I love thee” in my ear: The only words thou car'st to speak, The only words I seek to hear, The only music that should break The charmèd silence here! UNDER THE WESTERN STAR. Under the western star, Under the low gleams of the crescent moon I see his white sail gliding from afar, In the warm wind of June. Blow, wind of summer, blow! Nor linger in the gardens of the west: Blow, blow; thou bringest all too slow The loved one to my breast. Too slow, my heart, too slow For thy fond pulses, that tumultuous beat As they would burst their bounds, and seaward flow To clasp him ere we meet.— Fades the sweet evening light In purple splendours of the summer dark; But starlike in the glow of my delight Glimmers his homeward bark. He comes! I hear his keel Gride on the silver shingle of the shore; Peace, foolish heart! nor all thy joy reveal At meeting him once more. SONG. With the sunshine and the swallows and the flowers, She is coming, my belovèd, o'er the sea! And I sit alone and count the weary hours, Till she cometh in her beauty back to me; And my heart will not be quiet, But, in a “purple riot,” Keeps ever madly beating At the thought of that sweet meeting, When she cometh with the summer o'er the sea; All the sweetness of the south On the roses of her mouth, All the fervour of its skies In her gentle northern eyes, As she cometh, my belovèd, home to me! No more, o' nights, the shivering north complains, But blithe birds twitter in the crimson dawn; No more the fairy frost-flowers fret the panes, But snowdrops gleam by garden-path and lawn; And at times a white cloud wingeth From the southland up, and bringeth A warm wind, odour-laden From the bowers of that fair Aden, Where she lingers by the blue Tyrrhenian Sea; And I turn my lips to meet Its kisses faint and sweet; For I know from hers they've brought The message, rapture-fraught: “I am coming, love, with summer, home to thee!” THE STUDENT TO HIS WIFE. Let them grovel o'er their gains, Basely used, as basely got— Narrow hearts and shallow brains! Surely such we envy not. A truer, nobler wealth is ours: Wealth in immortal books that lies; In memories of exalting hours Of converse with the good and wise; In wants and sympathies that draw Our nature heavenward—as the flower, Obedient to the eternal law, Is sunward bent in shine and shower; In aims that through the darkest night Of sorrow burn with steadfast glow; In hopes that, like the solar light, Change tears to rainbows as they flow; In faith that turns the carking care— The weakness, weariness, and pain Of common life—to praise and prayer, Till Eden blooms for us again! And scarcely should we start to see An angel meet us in our walk, Or hear celestial melody Blend with our quiet evening talk. Such are the riches, gentle wife, That, showered upon us from on high, Have shed a sweetness round our life Their barren millions could not buy, And still will shed—whate'er betide— While unpolluted by the stain Of worldly avarice or pride The garments of our souls remain. Then let us strive to keep them pure, And, hand in hand, with single heart— Rich in God's love, and only poor In what we scorn—so do our part, That Here the good may call us friend— And, when the parting hour hath come, The spirits of the blest may bend From Heaven to give us welcome Home! TO THE SUMMER WIND. I. Thou wanderer of the summer air! Thou spirit wild and free! In what shadowy region far and fair May thy viewless dwelling be? Beneath yon crispèd clouds that sleep On the verge of the western sea? Beyond the clouds? or beyond the deep, Unfathomed blue of immensity, Is it there thou makest thy halcyon home When the joyous day is done— Lapt in some bright, elysian dome By the sister genii spun, Of starry beams, Or the lingering gleams Of the purple-shrouded sun? II. I know not:—and thou singest ever An inarticulate song. Like the voice of a quiet river Gliding by moonlight along, With magic music, soft and deep, As echoes from the world of sleep!— But this I know, that thou art fair, For I have seen thee in my dreams, With parted lips and streaming hair, Gliding in beauty down the streams Of the azure noontide air; Or underneath the harvest moon, To the mossy rills below, Singing a weird and wayward tune While the foam-bells come and go, Glitteringly with endless motion, Like fairy ships on a fairy ocean! III. Nor boots it where thy home may be:— Beyond the clouds, or beneath the sea; Among the Sons of Power who guide The planets in their fleet career; Or with the Naiades who glide, With blue eyen soft and clear, Through the glimmering flowers Of the ocean bowers:— I feel that thou art here! And, like a lover's when he knows The lady of his love is near, Swiftly my life-blood ebbs and flows With an inexplicable fear— A honeyed anguish, a delight That aches, a yearning infinite,— Doubts, hopes, and wishes strangely blent In sweet, contenting uncontent! IV. I see thee not, I clasp thee not; Yet feel I thou art nigh, Shedding around this lonely spot The dews of melody; Shedding from thine aërial wings, And from thy swift and viewless feet, A shower of dulcet murmurings, And wandering odours faint and sweet, That steal about my soul, and lull To peace its wailings sorrowful With a delicious calm, a rest Which even to dream were to be blest: Although its very sweetness wrings The heart with strange, mysterious pain— Moving upon the frozen springs Of feeling, till their waters rain In burning tear-drops from the eye, I feel not how—I know not why! Nor know I if 'tis joy or woe Impels them in their fiery flow. But this I wote: that sweeter far Than all delights of sense they are; That rather would I dwell with thee Alone in these green solitudes, Than share the loud world's thoughtless glee, Thou minstrel of the summer woods!— Thou whisperer by the summer sea! For thou in all my spirit's moods Hast still a spirit-sympathy, Love-taught, I fondly will believe! Or never could thy trancèd voice With such delicious sadness grieve; With such wild mirth rejoice! V. Ha! art thou fled?—I felt but now Thy faint lips kiss my wooing brow; Felt thy far-floating locks with mine Their odorous tresses intertwine With soothing freshness; heard thy song Amid the leaves, around, above— Now like the stifled breath of love, When eyes are dim, and fond lips press The first sweet grape of tenderness— Low, tremulous and long! Now like the tinkling of a rill That falls into a lake— Some tiny tarn upon a hill That fairy Mab her bath might make, If she and her fantastic train Should ever roam the earth again! Now like the song of summer birds— The mingling song of birds and bees; Now like the long-forgotten words Recalled by whispering twilight trees In July gloamings, when alone We muse on loved ones changed or gone; Now like the echoes of a flute Heard in some leafy dell, Low-warbling till the birds are mute; Now like a distant bell, Whose saintly summons, silvery-clear, Falls on the homeward boatman's ear, At twilight's holy hour, From out the depths of the rosy air, Calling his soul to silent prayer With still, small voice of power! THE APOLLO OF THE VATICAN. God of the golden locks and beamy brow! Embodied splendour! Phœbus-Apollo! Thou, Time-born, but heir of immortality! Still stand'st thou radiant—like a mighty star, Darting supernal effluence afar O'er the slow stream of change, that, rolling by, Hath swept from earth Religions, Peoples, Crowns— Like vapour down into the silent sea Of grey Oblivion—leaving uninjured Thee, Its marble conqueror! Still that proud lip frowns In scornful triumph o'er thy prostrate foe, The earth-spawned Python, Mutability! Still from that stern, indomitable eye The arrowy lightnings flash that laid the reptile low. Rome, 1861. A CONFESSION. No, Buonarroti, thou shalt not subdue My mind with thy Thor-hammer! All that play Of ponderous science with Titanic thew And spastic tendon—marvellous, 'tis true!— Says nothing to my soul. Thy “terrible way” Has led enow of worshippers astray; I will not walk therein! Nor yet shalt thou, Majestic Raphael,—though before thee bow The nations, with their tribute of renown,— Lead my heart captive. Great thou art, I own,— Great—but a Pagan still. But Here—breathe low, The place is hallowed—here, Angelico! Heart, mind, and soul, with reverent love, confess The Christian Painter; sent to purify and bless! Chapel of Nicholas V., Vatican, 1861. ST PETER'S: A TYPE. And this is San Pietro! This the shrine Where, for so many centuries, have bowed In abject awe the unreflecting crowd Of votaries—even as to a thing divine! But men begin to know thee now, and smile At their past blindness: seeing thee most vile, Despite thy braggart bulk and vulgar waste Of precious things—faith, genius, energy— Most precious they of all; and most misplaced Thus dedicate, prodigious Sham, to Thee!— Within, without, o'erwritten with the name Of the crowned Beast, and blazoned with the shame Of his pollution! Shall it long be so, Just Heaven?—My heart is sick and angry; let us go! Rome, October 1861. AT VERONA. The moon is full, as on that balmy night When love-lorn Juliet called her Romeo In maiden-treble, tremulous and low: Half sigh, half song; and from the odorous gloom Of myrtle boughs and jasmine rich with bloom His voice made answer through the silvery light, In proud Verona, here, so long ago!— Now, other echoes fill thy outraged halls: The heavy tramp of Austrian sentinels; The ceaseless drum-roll, and the signal's boom From fort to fort. The clanking of the chain That holds thee—but not long shall hold!—in thrall, Fair city! Thy blind Despot strives in vain; Freedom is on the march!—Dost hear her trumpet call? 1861. AT FLORENCE. From Bellos-guardo as the sun went down I gazed on queenly Florence where she lay Smiling among her olives, silvery grey; Like topaz gleamed her many-towerèd crown; And like some golden river of the blest, Swept Arno by her marble palaces,— Through plains more fair than musing Fancy sees In sunset heavens,—towards the golden west. But not her loveliness, nor that which claims A wider homage from a subject world— Her proud aureola of deathless names! Made my heart glow:—I saw a flag unfurled In the clear air: the Flag of Italy! That told of Tyrants crushed and a Great People Free! 1861.</field>
