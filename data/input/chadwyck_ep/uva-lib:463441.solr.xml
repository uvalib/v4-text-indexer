      <field name="fulltext">EPITHALAMIUM: OR, A Nuptiall Song, with a Narrative of Loves progresse: Consecrated to the honoured fame of His much valued Friends, M?. Abraham Cullen, and M??. Abigail Rushout, the blest Objects of this Triumphant Solemnity: To whom I wish a Life enduring continuance of this Dayes felicity, Whilst I remain obliged to the Honour of Their especiall favours, and rest their most humble Servant Leonard Laurence. Shal Angels leave their glorious Orbs &amp; Sphær, And with the Gods vouchsafe to frolick here; Shall to the glory of this famous Day, So many Friends as Votaries, freely pay The tribute of their love, and represent Their souls in Courtship, wishing sweet content, With matchless pleasures, copiously to flow Spring-tydes of bliss, till to a Sea they grow Of pure delight: (on which, whilst Zephyrs milde Ingross the waves, like Venus great with childe: Her wel-rigg'd Pinnace, trim'd with Cambrick Sails, And golden Anchors, wantons in the gales.) And I rest silent, as my thoughts were grown A lump of Ice, wrapt in the frigid Zone. No, love forbid, I e're should perpetrate A crime so great, as not to celebrate This solemn Festivall with all the best, And choicest Honours lodged in my brest. For in this Chrystall Region, where the Sun, In each fair Madams eye most brightly burns. Should I remain congeal'd, and in such fires Not streight dissolve, and fountain forth desires: The World might judge (and soon rest satisfi'd, Since Ice will melt) my brest was petrefi'd: And fit for no expression: which conceit I'le vindicate: and shew that I as great Respect, and honour, cordially intend, Without presumption, as a neerer friend. The thought of which inflames my soul with wishes, My fancie's fier'd by th' infusing Kisses Of yo'n illustrious Virgin, in whose eyes, Insconc'st in Diamonds, a whole Array lies Of beauteous Rhetorique, which might well perswade A flintie Atheist, Heaven to invade With obsecrations: that his power would please To crown that fair one, with perpetuall ease. But here, me thinks, I'me askt, what that I mean By this large Prologue; how I lay my Scæne: Or what these words imply, as Love and Wishes, Gods, Angels, Sphærs, content, and am'rous Kisses. Why know th'are attributes, that do belong To perfect up this day a nuptiall song: The which I consecrate unto a pair, Of Lovers chast as is the chrystall ayre: Whose gen'rous souls like Turtels symphatize, Whilst Love draws pictures in their am'rous eyes: Whose draught, in time, may guide both her, and him, When to the life, they undertake to limme. At this the heavens smile, th' armonious Sphærs As in their Orbs, move in my ravisht ears, And with melodious Anthems, sweetly chime Delightfull welcomes, to this wisht for time: 'Tis all gaudeamus, Lutes and Viols play: And all solemnize Hymens holy day: Observable, even from the youthfull prime, And infancy of long continuing time: When pregnant Nature pinn'd on Adam's sleeve, A pretty thing to play with, called Eve, Whom he imbrac't, and finding that the Bride, Was taken thence, e'ne log'd her by his side. The parallel, this day will make appear, The names but alter'd; such a Wedding's here; Ordain'd by vertuous Love, whose rule allows A sacred Hymen, to inroll their vows: Free from fantastick passion, which bereaves Judgment of reason, and the soul deceives. 'Tis Apish love, that by a subtile Art Flies through the eyes, and Vulturs on the heart: Camelion courtship, subject to the fate Of flashie Lightning, which expireth streight Flames of that Nature do not Mætor here, Sincere Affections solid are, and clear. For those that with a reverent fear approach, T'inflame their lamps at Hymens sacred torch: Shall beacon forth to all the world their bright And splendent glory, which shall know no night. But all this while, where doth great Hymen stay, Step prethee Cupid, call the God away: For all things else in their decorum stand, Design'd and order'd by thy mothers hand. He's onely wanting, prethee therefore run, Thou shalt have sweet-meats when thou do'st return. For then thou mai'st at leasure freely sip Conserve of Roses, from each Ladie's lip. I have my wish, he's just arriv'd, the flame Of his bright Tapers, verifies the same. Our Bridegroom follows like a rising Sun: His chariot wheels like Titan's swiftly run: Who as he hurries through the chrystall Globe To kisse his Thetis, in her sea-green Robe: Presents our Bridegroom: how his worth doth pace With active speed, his Fairest to imbrace. Which that he may two spotlesse Virgins guide His welcome presence, where his matchlesse Bride (Like chast Diana 'mongst her Nymphs) doth tend The wisht for entrance, of so dear a friend, Whose blest appearance doth delight her so, That in a trice a spring of Roses grow In her fresh cheeks: then sealing on her hand His morning thoughts, a while both wondring stand As extasis'd, with the extream excesse Of their united mutuall happinesse. Which rapture past, from her sweet lips he sups A dram of Nectar, and ripe cherries plucks. (Oh miracle of love! I can't remember, I ever saw such fruit in cold December.) Then takes his leave, and kissing of her hand Two of his train, that there appointed stand, Respectively their humble service tender, And with a kisse, receive his sweet surrender. What want we then? the Nuptiall God doth stay, Come sprightfull Bride-men, bring your charge away, Love's chariot's fitted, and attendant stayes; The seats are trim'd with Rosemary and Bayes, The which ingenious Art hath verdent kept Spight winters rage, by tears that Roses wept. Behold, she moves! like Juno in her state, A troop of gallant Virgins on her wait. Conduct her gently then (Loves Ushers) and Resign her beauty to the honour'd hand Of her dear Choice, who'l not fail or misse, To hand her in the chariot with a kisse. Cupid drive on, it is already time, Hark, Hark, the Angels, they all-in, do chyme. Hold rein, thy Doves w'are at the Temple gate Descend our matchlesse pair with all their state And Nuptiall train: and summon then the Graces, For to direct them to their severall places; Where while they sit, great Hymen we thee pray T' in-augurate this solemne Mariage-day. And since so far accompany'd th'are come, With smiling Venus, and her wanton sonne, Associated by the triumphant state Of Jove and Juno for to celebrate Those sacred rites, which their chast vows enjoyn, To be performed at thy holy shrine. Let all the odours which thy altars breathe A sacred requiem to their loves bequeath. Crown them with Myrtle chaplets, and present Them with the treasures of all sweet content. Let no sad Omen, no alternate fate, The happy juncture of their hearts translate. May Loves sweet language evermore dispute All differences, which kisses still confute. And if perchance, there any question rise, Silence their tongues, and plead it with their eyes. Blesse them with all thy chief delights, and blisses, And blesse them in th' enjoyment of my wishes. So shall this day, the well penn'd Prologue prove Of their lives action, in the Scæns of love. These wishes heard, great Hymen now proceed, Perform thy office, by the Gods decreed: Their hands, their hearts, their souls and thoughts conjoyn And bind them fast with thy religious twine. They both consent, and in their vows appeal To heaven, to witnesse, what their hearts do seal. Yet let those tyes that shall confine and hold Their congruous loves, be wrought of purest gold: That so they may like Jems, those lockets wear Not as constraining knots, that irksome are. Love's duty acted, ev'ry one hasts back, Where Ganymed presents them healing Sack: The Bridegroom in a rich impleated bowl, Commends a health to his espoused soul; Which she accepts, and as a pledg lets slip A Robe and Rubie from her orient lip; Which scarce accomplisht, see the Youngsters streight, As if all Tarquins, put her to a strait. Nor can her prayers prevail, although she begs It's for the garters that surround her legs: But those whose fortune could not reach so high, Snatch at the ribbons which her shooes do tye. The Virgins they as fast for recreation, Plunder the Bridegroom, of his visitation. And other fancies: which they multiply With their conceits: as in their fans they tie That regiment of knick-knacks: which as prize Now at the mercy of their usage lies. This battle over, they invent new sport, One tels a story how Loves-Queen did court Unkind Adonis: whilst her Mate cryes fie, How was he bred, that could a Queen denie. The young men intermix, and act their part One vows h'hath lost, and there must finde his heart. A second tels his Lady, that he spies Cupid discharge his arrows through her eyes. A third protests, that Juno, nor the graces, Could ever trip it as his Mrs. paces: Which to maintain, the Musique, he ordains, And with the Virgin danceth to their strains. A fourth collects fresh Flowers, another seeks A Myne of Rubies, in his Madam's cheeks. All are imploy'd, some kisse the Brides fair hand, Others observe how all things order'd stand. Whilst some applaud the Bridegrooms happy fate. And give Encomiums to the mariage state. Mean-while the tables are most richly disht With delicates, and if the Gods had whisht To entertain their Loves, could not have been With greater state, and order served in. The Bridegroom's health goes round, which is reply'd With full brim'd wishes, to his fairest Bride. The day, thus hastens, to another Sphær, We leave the table, wearied with great chear. The evening fals, Illustrious Sol retires, And in his room comands lesse sparkling fires: Night in her Love-hood, having over-drawn With tissu'd Cypresse Heavens ætheriall Lawn. Enters (the friendly crowd) attyr'd in Jet, With glistering oes, and spangles richly set. And whispers Venus; who streight steps aside, And tels the errand, to the blushing Bride, Who apprehends it; and without delay, The signall given, nimbly trips away Unto Loves rendevous. The Virgin's trace Her gracefull steps; and follow her apace. Amongst which train, some few grave Matrons presse, Who while th' unrobe her, preach the happinesse Of those rare pleasures, and delicious sweets, Experienc'd by them in the Nuptiall sheets. Revested then in her last vestall tyres, The non plus ultra of her Virgin fires: They with good counsell guide her to the bed, (Where (God be with't) adieu a Maiden-head.) Where hardly lay'd, the Bridegroom gently knocks, The door some Virgin, with a smile, unlocks: Saluting all he enters, and apace Hies to the bed, his Fairest to imbrace; And e're the Virgins are aware, undrest; He by the side of his dear Love doth rest, Who like a Saint doth lye, the Fairie Queen Was in her night cloaths n'er so pretty seen. Th' unruly troop of Youngsters, fol'wing, throng: And taxe the Ladies of a mighty wrong, In so transporting, secretly, the Bride Without their knowledg, e're it was espy'd: Which they excuse with smiles, and then incite Them all to go, and bid the Bride good night: Which they perform, each pouring forth his wishes; And so retreat, taking their leaves with kisses. The room now clear'd, our Lover he invites His pretty Consort to unknown delights: She not acquainted with the complement, Seeks, with her sighing Rheth'rique, to prevent His forward will, and begs that, as a Maid, He'l not presume her honour to invade. He pleads 'tis lawfull, by the Gods decree, She argues still, and craves repreev'd to be: Mean-while he takes her in his am'rous arms, And having whisper'd secretly some charms, The Magick works: and by blind loves black art, I know not how, hath seiz'd him of her heart. With which rich Jewell, I will leave him blest, And recommend them to their private rest. Onely one thing they may please to remember, It's nine moneths just, 'twixt this and next September.
