      <field name="fulltext">???????? ?? ?? ??????????. Æsch. Agam. [Thou, whom I know not—knew not; whose mere name] Thou, whom I know not—knew not; whose mere name Is secret as all wondrous symbols old, Wherefrom the gnawing and oblivious years Have eaten out their meanings; whose sweet lips Wrought not their marvels of deliciousness On mine; yea, whose pure eyes were but as drops Of misty light in some far system pendant, That might have clear'd and centred into suns Full of new glory, being moved anear; Whose voice is but the ebbing of a wind Along the utmost skirts of forest-glens, That makes a part of silence, 'tis so still; Whose life—alas! a legend and a dream Woven of Fancy from thin threads of truth, Is all thy life to me: If in thy walks, Creeping and fluttering back to what thou wert, In some neglected nook thy wondering ear Should light upon these voices of the Past,— Know, they are all for thee; all uttered And mooted to the blabbing pitiless winds That thou mayst hear: so, leave them not to die— Take up and store them—no, not in thy heart, But in some meanest corner at the edge Of thy wide being; there, the while thy soul Moves like a planet circled in its sphere, With a faint zone of loves and memories That worship from afar, O let them rest,— Prophetic utterances that shall not pass Without fulfilment in the latter days Old heir-looms, waiting as in trustfulness Among the lurking lumber, till there come A due return of fashion and of times To make them precious: gazing on them thus, Not with wet eyes or sobbing voice, or aught That shakes the firm foundations of control, And wrests thee from thy duties,—wait, and nurse Unseen the mute indulgence of that hope That cannot be a sin; until what time Our ancient freedom comes again...... .....‘No more!’ PROLOGUE. It may be there are kindly hearts and pure Will all receive these crude imaginings, Above whose chiefest births the reverend year Keeps watch, with voice of Custom or of Law Which doth baptize our unexpectant youth With sudden manhood; feeble they, and weak, And largely woof'd with error—and, at times, Some unfelt shadow of another's thought May brood above; yet haply those true hearts Will kindly use them, for the sake of all Dear quiet shrines in Nature's holy fane, Where chiefly they were born—those sculptured cells And lonely chapels, all our own and Love's, Hard by a sheltering aisle, where we may rest In virgin mood of meditative prayer, Unheeding all, nor heeded of, the din And tramplings of the wide thick-peopled nave: For they have loved them too; have they not loved Some castled summit, or some lone blear'd crag, O'er cavern'd roots, all sheeny to the sun With disks of splinter'd shale, that manifests A broken bulk against the lucid sky, Crusted with hoary lichens, whereon Thought Dwells in a calm and printless paradise, While from the sweet and melancholy blue And its faint burstings of luxurious waves On pebbles far beneath, upswells a soul Of inexpressive tenderness and peace:— Or some grey homestead, by its kindred church Close-nestled, and with creeping flowers embloom'd And green verandahs, whence fresh coolness breathes Into the shadow'd rooms, laden by day With scents of twisted jasmine and of rose,— By night with low bird-music, and some shreds Of scatter'd moonlight dappling all the gloom:— Or last, some antique cloister, deepest loved By such as they, with lustrous memories And hallow'd dawns thick-floating round her courts— Her carven courts, where we have walk'd, and been Heirs of the unreturning Past, and all The lucid trail she leaves; and have inform'd, In stedfast purpose for the after life, Our patient souls with Wisdom's beautiful Deep thoughts serene, as knowing that the Past Is but an elder Future; they are twins, Each with her bright face bathed in differing glow Of eve and morning—on the elder's brow Soft western glories linger, and the flush Of melting sunset; but clear orient light Burns on the younger's forehead. These, O friend, Thou also knewest haply, and didst love Unspeakably; so may their memories be Within thee as thou readest, smoothing down Thy crested soul to loving sympathy, Or meet forbearance, with a brother's thoughts— Thoughts not unlike all heartwrung melodies, Which ever keep some deeper sense below The graven words, and run like slender clues But faithful, through the labyrinthine life Of him who bears them; which all faintest thrills And gusts of feeling do suffice to move, That o'er the tense firm heart of manhood pass Unfelt, or graze some puny nerve and die; But, in the tender juicy-fibred home Of younger life, do strike it to the core, And pierce its very being thro', and warp Its onward course for evermore. Farewell! 1850. KOSMOS: OR, THE LIFTING OF THE VEIL. Out of the hush'd low valleys, and the dells Unseen, where we have lived,—out of the sphere Of calm accustom'd faces—characters Akin, and smoothen'd to a common type By intercourse,—out of the household ways And home delights and habits, which have shut In warm seclusion thro' their early growths Our delicate souls,—out of the days when all Our little thoughts and meagre knowledges Dwelt as in dreams, unconscious of themselves And full contented,—we arise, bewitch'd By the inarticulate voice of circumstance That will not be withstood, and plant our feet Upon the dizzy edges of the world. Knowest thou what we feel? Didst ever wind With lazy eyes and unexpectant heart For many a league along some noiseless path, Thro' forest-glooms and hanging dark ravines And cloud-wreaths from the hills,—and suddenly, Turning some rocky barrier of the path, Burst on a broad and beautiful champaign, Swimming in sunlight, rich with waving corn And towns and farms and rivers,—where a glow Of balmy breaths steams upward, and beneath Rings with far music all the twinkling air? Didst ever climb with vague unheeding feet Some sloping downs, and where the level brow Darkens against the sky, look down, and plunge Thy mazed soul in the blue light of the sea? Thou knowest what we feel.—A naked fool Soak'd i' the melting snow! a lean, lost fool!— We speed again thro' books and men and things— How! a new consciousness is here—our life Opaque has grown transparent, self-illumed! “I have not here a feeling or a thought That has not been another's,—only work'd Afresh and kneaded, thro' the diverse souls Of many generations: I'm a toy Made by the thousand for a fair, and each Twin to the other; why, such counterparts May change and shuffle thro' a thousand deals, And no one be the wiser! Other men Wear large imposing wisdom on their brows— Walk crown'd and glory'd thro' the land, and seem To read the faces of all heaven and earth As easily as a brother's: but I toil Aye in the slippery shallows, while the sea Of knowledge rises to my very lips, Then ebbs for ever. Nature unto me Is a veil'd Pythia, from her twilight shrine Murmuring poetic mysteries; and this Tho' the small scope of our horizon bounds My every quest! The whirlpools of the earth— Hot seething cities—I walk into them And curse my understanding: what a maze Of unintelligible interests, Unseen connexions, puny facts that stand Alone and unexplain'd, or sweltering lie In heaps of rank confusion, heaving up To blurr and blind the dizzy soul that dares To keep its Being unabsorb'd, and ask— What mean these things? A rout of gaudy beads, Slipt from the string, and sliding up and down, Shorn of a visible purpose and a home— A hissing whirl of life, from darkest deeps In the hill-side that shoots thro' narrow light To plunge into a darker. Every face Whose eyes meet mine, is as the nucleus Of some thick nebulous galaxy of lives, Wheeling dependent orbits intricate Beyond, beyond my ken—is as the rise Of sudden dolphins thro' the tremulous sea, That in the sunlight curl, and plunge, and leave That little moment for their history. Widening my eyes to grasp a larger ken— How can I track the fierce electric speed Of such an age as ours? How extricate From mountainous masses of effect the old And generative causes, or perceive Which way and where the Past hath work'd and striven To bring us up to this,—and in what shape Its reverend shadows on the fields around Do lie, and how with swift unconscious ebb The very Present where I gazing stand Fails into Memory; and the light how far Of these our deeds, when we are in the west, Shall climb the distant zenith; and how long Our throes and pulses all may linger on, And shake the sensitive Future as they go To likeness of ourselves? And ‘What!’ exclaims A larger spirit in my ear—‘What! spend Squander and spill the sum of thy regards On deeds and interests of one little land? Thou seest the unequal triad, that divide The sovereignty of Time—that they provoke And sorely prove the weak inquiring soul,— That chiefly, closing round our central place, The neighbourhoods stupendous on each side Whelm us in grandeur, like the perplext roar Of cataracts,—that, winged for escape, Shoots the frail Present timidly between Those cloven bergs cyanean, imminent With bulky heights of Memory and of Hope:— So too, nor less, the Kosmos that we see— Expansive space—faints timidly beneath Her cumulative wonders: ancient homes— Forlorn encampments of the vagrant Past, Long tenantless; imperial monuments, Whose unregarded ruins no wide boons Nor teachings influential call their home, And mix for us sweet gratitude with awe,— Memorials of oblivion; others, which, In deepest death exuberant with life, Hail us from far, and with adopting voice Take half the world for citizens and sons; About whose odorous fields their pilgrims walk Knee-deep in legends and high memories, While every whisper of the current air Is music to a Pæan: neighbourhoods Where the meek bosom of the patient Earth Fierce hoofs of battle wounded; where the free And dainty steps of Fortune and of Fame Most oft did visit, and abode most long, And left with largest tears; wherever men, Holpen of circumstance, or innate strength Of race, or high infectious excellence And heavenward promptings of the age and clime, 'Mid blessings and 'mid sympathies arose Of woods and waves and mountains and the blue, And group'd themselves magnificently far From common times,—with nourishment divine Of cool nepenthe and fair asphodel Feeding themselves to heroes. Then the lands That now i' the wayward bosom of Renown Lie cradled—mountains by volcanic strength Shot through blind clifts in some dull plain to shame The ancient hills—deep-toothed gulfs, wherein The wandering whirlpool of men's energies,— The wrestlings of whate'er imperial race Carves its own name upon the passive age,— Foams unresisted: what innumerous sounds And pantings of illimitable life In these full lands arise! The royal boom And thunder of the armies of the earth,— The voice of many workers, smoothing out Over the craggy barriers of To-day, A passage for the Morrow,—the wide crash When tyrants fall, and the crush'd peoples rise, And make themselves immortal—but how soon, Gulping deep draughts of hot delirious blood Out of the foemen's skulls, do gorge themselves To madness! Next, nor viewless nor apart In thought if yet in time, unveiling stands The silent Future, in her own new spheres And distant climates seeking to be born: She is unknown by face, and yet how clear We mark her throes and struggles in the womb, Till with the moving cycle she emerge Full-panoplied!’ Concerning this our world, And her great trinities of Space and Time, That goading spirit preaches, till my soul Bursts with distress and eagerness. But more: For I have seen a vision, that swam in Thro' the transparent awnings of my eyes In sleep—a dream of wonder and despair. I stood among the courses of the worlds, A shadowing spirit near me, to unfold Whate'er of lesser mystery might be dwarf'd To human understanding. All around Huge suns were driving like gigantic hail Across the blank of space: and I, though swoln To an archangel's bulk, was fain to dip And swerve, when any of the swarming crowd Shot toward me. Not with restless noise they moved, Like the swift fierce inventions of the earth, But calm and silent as the path of souls Upborne by buoyant angels through the vast Into our Father's bosom; and I saw That that old fabled music of the spheres Was but the cooling of an orb's warm face Against the gelid ether. Not for long We stood in ravishment, deep-plunged amid That seething hive of planets and thick stars, Without a special interest; for behold, Far down a vacant avenue of gloom— A long deep gorge—out of the purple dark A point arose, and travell'd up that bare Black fiord, enlarging ever, till it curved A rapid arc among the shoals of stars, And rounded up to me. I felt a thought From that unseen immortal at my side Explode within me—‘This is thine own Earth!’ With feelings then as of some voyager Fresh from grand halls and vasty pyramids Of the old East, who enters once again That little chamber of his youth, I stoop'd Above the puny world as bends some girl Over an insect in her palm, and scann'd With shaded eyes the wonder as it pass'd:— Thick creamy clouds of glowing vapour clung Round the swift orb, and from the whirling bulk Curl'd flakes and ribbon'd shreds of showery foam Spun like a rain of burning blooms, and dash'd Against my eyes, and lavishly behind Swept o'er the oblivious vast a billowy breadth Of lurid bronze: but I, thro' jagged rifts That slit the wreathing masses as a maid Parts her bright hair in clusters with the morn, Beholding, probed to the dark rugged rind O'the earth, and saw a moving dust of men, Hot, smoky, drifting ever to and fro Across the aimless desert; and perceived A storm of little voices, screaming up To the great heavens for food and air and rest, And health and truth and knowledge and for fame; And heard among that rout low breaths of prayer, And tender women's voices, and clear men's, Wandering amazed, like a meek melody That winds alone amid the crashing chords. I learnt no more: for the coy vivid Earth Fled thro' my fingers, plunging eagerly Among the sheltering worlds, as dives a hind Into dew-blossom'd thickets of the morn. Bravely the sparkles of that sheeny trail Toil'd in her surging wake; until from high The long unfinish'd slope of her ellipse Shone like the broken circlet of a god Falling thro' space: but in the far extreme That thick bright flood grew shallow, and its blaze Unknit and shiver'd into many threads Of tremulous light, that flicker'd like a web In air, till one by one they snapt, and all The beaded atoms brilliant were ysprent Thro' the abyss, and languish'd and grew dim, And flash'd and fumed and were extinguished; Like stragglers in the desert, when that huge Swift choking death is imminent behind Their fleeter fellows. So the marvel pass'd, But not my thoughts: this then is all the scope And compass of those many million hopes And loves and longings—this is the one home Of those long linked lives of lordly men, From Adam down to us—this is the world Whereof men preach that only over it The Father bends, and spreads to its full stretch The cordon of his everlasting arms To grasp this mote, and hath encircled it With hugest spheres innumerous, that they Might pierce with little points of utmost light The eyeballs of a man! hath hoarded up The milk and honey of immortal teats Only for lips of theirs; and ripens aye For them alone the unutterable wealth Of Heaven! Why, this microscopic Earth! Had I but thought, I might have brush'd it dead With one sweep of a finger or a nail, And not have cared to blow the dust away! A larger vision. For that spirit's will Enabled me, and made that with bold brow I breasted the great onset of the spheres, And clove the downward press as a fork'd barb The solid clouds, and shook from my wide hair, Like burrs o' the brake, full many driven lights And floating spangles of the comets' tails; Soaring the while, until we gain'd at length A belt of uninhabitable void— Lagoon on whose calm edge the surf of stars Ceased and was still. Therein thro' time untold We moved, like those old seamen on the strange And tenantless Pacific—steep'd at whiles In currents cold, wherefrom no fragrance bare Sweet record of their birth—full of moist awe, In that dread Absence of created things To feel ourselves alive. Then came a plunge Into another zone of wheeling suns Thick-group'd, innumerous, as the last,—wherein Erratic nameless torrents of keen sparks, A hurrying crew, career'd most lawlessly Among the staid old worlds: and then, beyond, Another breadth of desolated dark, And then new zones, new deserts,—till that nest Of distant planets round about our sun Seem'd like a brood all cold and motherless Of little wailing worlds, entomb'd within The black umbrageous ether in some lone Forgotten corner of the universe.— Enough! O vast illimitable God— O solemn weight, enormous aggregate Of wisdoms inconceivable—superb Gigantic avalanche of splendid truths And mysteries of knowledge, drowning us In fierce amaze—cold, cruel, biting plunge Of something keener than an adder's tooth Into our wincing vitals! But the throes And intellectual agonies, that raved From side to side of these impregnable And desperate crags of knowledge, wet with blood And blind with dust of battles and with tears, Are still'd—we are too weak to struggle now: Let the invincible immortals reign, And we be brutes! Yea, we grow kneaded up Among the soulless dumb existences Around, and consciousness as in a mist Departs, and self forgets itself—we lie A very nothing: till, with long abode In the familiar presence of those spells That wrought us this, we from our frenzied trance Come forth like men from sickness, rising up A crush'd, emaciated thing, and slow With flaccid foot slink shuddering into— No! Not death! There comes a brightness from behind— We are envelopt in clear, shining showers Warm'd from the big black clouds; and all above Large rainbows break and glisten on the dark: O now we know our places and the time! We were young angels, offering at heaven Unfledged and immature,—who in vague dreams Forgot themselves to madness—dreams that scorn'd To drink their life from this our fatherland, And died for lack of moisture. But hurrah! Now we are men—Promethean men, with brave And nervous hearts, who grasp the royal flame That welds those struggling errors into truth:— Not to be transcendental, crunching out With savage heel unblest the dearer part That makes us human; not to be as brutes, And choke with gross rank gush the purer part That maketh us divine. And we do know, In part, our course and purpose in the world— Why we are here, and with what differing eyes 'Tis meet to look around us as we move: For, standing in the Present, bosom-deep In rushing life, that ancient strong desire That grasps and clutches at the lordly Past,— That fever'd and regretful hungering For lovely things departed, smoothens down To healthier fondness, wholesome as the dew To flowers that know not rain: nor less the large Wild Future spheres her vagrant fiery stars Into most loyal orbits and serene: And, working staunchly in the painful round Of daily tasks that wean us from ourselves And brace and tone us into manliness, Those high and dangerous beauties, which to see Toss'd from its balance the unweighted spirit And bred conceits that made the elders smile, Lose the false harm that was not of themselves But us, and cooling into distance, shine True and undazzling—shooting from afar Long level splendours, which the porous heart Absorbs and is refresh'd. Thus some strong law Makes, that thro' resignation and thro' toil And patient long endurance, we shall grow In knowledge and in perfectness; that thus We shall evolve its meanings out of Life, And, or in nature or the wondrous coil Of our own being or the press o' the world, Shall see the purpose growing thro' the act, And see the clues that wind thro' things, and see Our lesser wisdom branching into more: That thus, thro' faith and low communion sweet, That vague Eternal shall become for us The Father, and the Spirit, and the Son.” BEGINNINGS. Now the cool Night bathes her purple forehead In the awakening glow that bids her die; Leaves the bright imaginative Morning Faintly blushing thro' her native sky: Morn! tho' yet her baby-glances tremble Weakly in the yellow glistering haze, Even now weird Hope and spell-fraught Fancy Feel the lustre of her cloudless gaze. Sheering off into the northern heavens, Cold and shadows leave the Earth awhile; O'er her time-worn face fair Spring is bending— Bids her ope her slumbrous eyes and smile. What tho' buds and twinkling dewdrops tell us Smiles are but the glitter on a tear?— Hope and Fancy watch them how they ripen Into laughter with the ripening year. Like the morn, and like the tender spring-time, Dawns the orient Future from the Past; Gold-grey lights above the girdling mountains Tell she surely comes, yet comes not fast. Mutely she and timidly floats upward O'er the clouded Present where we lie; But calm Hope and heaven-lit Fancy, gazing, Catch the splendours of her noonday sky. WAIT. Fret not, tho' all cherish'd musings Trickle from thy soul away,— Tho' thy thoughts be ever vainly Struggling upward toward the day: Fret not, tho' on earth thou wander Mask'd and muffled half from view,— Whilst the dear ones closest round thee Are but mask'd and muffled too: No; let life's eternal watchword Nerve thy heart, and guide thy brain— Action! Let the shout arouse thee To thy manly work again. Pore not o'er thy changeful Being— Ample task it is to Be; Thoughts that bring no help to labour, Were not born for earth and thee: Let them die—no tender blossoms In the winter frosts appear: Wait thou till the sunshine wakens In the spring-time of the year; Till the time when full communion Thro' untrammell'd souls shall thrill; Thought her disembodied music Flash from heart to heart at will. HOME. ‘Say what the wisest, worthiest prayer That buoys its wings with earthward air?’ She looked up thro' her drooping hair— ‘Pray for a home! ‘More sweet than song of moonlight bird, Or sea-born sounds at sunset heard, The music of that little word— The one word, Home! ‘On scatter'd lakes, where'er she move, The sweet somnambulist above For all her looks and thoughts of love Still finds a home: ‘If thus some shining word there be Which in all heavenward hearts and free A mirror of itself may see, That word is Home. ‘For always under bluest skies, Tho' half a heaven about us lies, The full heart whispers to the eyes, “This is not Home!”’ Ah, then, if spot so calm and sweet Make rest on earth for wearied feet, Say whither lies that blest retreat— Say, what is Home? ‘'Twere hard,’ she said, ‘for human kind— For each, tho' shapelessly and blind, Spontaneous in his untaught mind Knows what is Home; ‘And Feeling rules the human sky, Nor cares to scan with curious eye The cheering light she feels so nigh— The light of Home. ‘Each spirit hath a depthless mine Of buried gems and flowers divine, That in their own sweet lustre shrine Its thoughts of Home; ‘Each minds him of some sheltering trees, Some homestead, deep in billowy leas Or cheerful haunts of men; and these To him are Home: ‘Yet such things, tho' in close embrace They blend each meek attendant grace With the one thought that fills the place— The thought of Home; ‘Yet are they but as tangled flowers, Tended and twined in happiest hours, That smother with their scented showers The truth of Home: ‘They are but moons that wax and wane, And scarcely move the boundless main Of hallow'd memories that remain In that word Home. ‘No—wheresoe'er beneath the blue Some brood of kindred hearts and true Dwell shelter'd where the stranger's view May never come, ‘And, folded thus, together feel Each varying breath of woe or weal— Together smile, together kneel, In joy, in gloom; ‘While as they weep, or as they sing, Slow thro' the Autumn from the Spring They downward slope on calmest wing Toward the tomb; ‘Whether in cedar they abide, Or cottage by the green hill-side, Or thro' the barren world and wide For ever roam; ‘Where'er they stray, where'er they dwell, A wandering heaven is with them still; And tenderest angels, watching, tell That this is Home.’ [Life is like a tear] Life is like a tear Born in the sad depths of a woman's eyes— That brims up slowly thro' them, and then lies And rocks as in a cradle, warmly hid I' the rich brown shadow of her glossy lid: And then peeps out beneath it warily, Quivering in tremulous uncertainty, And rainbow'd like a bubble in the sun Upon the twinkling verge,—until with one Wild leap and gush of ripe intensity, And quick as random thoughts just born to die, Its darts away, shooting a dewy streak Over the fragrant blossoms of her cheek To the nether edge: wherefrom 'tis loosed, and sheer Drops in that sweet Unknown. PENSEROSA. She walks alone thro' the calm dells of life— Alone in heart, and loverless, and sere; And yet a husband's eyes are close to hers, And prompt to sun the shadow from her cheek, And brighten her strange sorrow: then she prays And fondly strives to be a loving wife, And warms away her memories and her tears With something like a smile; but when the dark Brings loneliness and that clear voiceless time Wherein the freed heart, having toil'd all day Beneath the exacting Present, turns awhile Unconsciously to creep her faltering way Back to some darling Past, and faintly muse On happier homes that nestled it of yore,— Oh then comes swimming round her like a dream The irresistible impulse, late forsworn But now again triumphant, and sweeps o'er Her yielding heart all pent-up thoughts, that will, Will force tumultuous entrance: Shall the night, The queenly moon, and stars, and full rich blue, Pregnant with unknown thoughts and hopes and loves Of wakeful souls in all the thousand years Since earth was Eden,—these, the gathering-bourne And far Valhalla of heroic Eld— Shall these things come, and not to each lone heart Bring its peculiar spirit in the train Of the majestic Mother—of the Moon? And so she wanders backward toward the glen Where rose the quiet fountain of her life, And looks upon the drooping flowers once more That woo'd her then to kiss them and to come Close—closely—up to them,—they said not why, But only said, it would be sweet to stay; And so she stay'd, poor artless trustful thing! These with her dimm'd but unreproachful eyes (Ah, too forgiving!) doth she linger o'er, Nor knows them wither'd now; and slowly treads Again the joyous seed-time of her years, And scents again the pure fresh innocent breath Of the untrodden Earth, when first awoke By touch of man to other thoughts than those Of childish, passionless rest: O, sad delight, To gather up these wrecks of shatter'd bowers, All with such tears of her own weeping wet, And cold and clammy with the ooze of Time! Why doth she so? Why builds a happy night To embitter all the morrow?—Oh, she feels Still in her heart that eldest, vastest grief, And seeks—how fondly seeks!—to stifle it By soothing; or perhaps these casual bursts But speak a failing sorrow, nigh to death. O no! it never, never dies—she glides Thro' the strange duties of her wedded life A timid prayerful nun; and ever sings— “Who truly loves, can love but once a life:” And as she goes, for ever toward the earth She turns the dark side of her shadow'd heart, And keeps the bright for memory and the stars. CLARE HALL. A long dim avenue of cloister'd elms, With lichen'd boles and sere luxuriantly Shooting their sombre way by glimpses up Thro' drooping masses sweet of pale spring-green Unripen'd into summer's: lower down, Bossing their stems like flowers, quaint curling gnarls Dotted with tender leaflings: on each hand Dark fringing lines of laurel evergreens, Making impervious secrecy between And silence: and far overhead a dome Of verdant light—a dreamy depthless glow Half seen, half felt,—most like to that serene And pearly clearness sleeping thro' still depths Of ocean-water: all the pathway lies In breadths unbroken steep'd of purple shade, Yet thin and half unreal, for ceaselessly Some ripe transparent lustre from above Melts downward thro' the shadow, flushing o'er With mellow haze of sunshine all the gloom. Thus do I walk, alone with loneliness, Almost alone with silence and repose;— But in the broad hush some sweet things are left To keep alive the memory of sound: The rippling roll of old monastic bells, That Nature loves, for kindliest with her own, Of all Art's studied voices, do they blend: The songs of timid birdlings in the brake— The laurel brake—trilling low quivering sounds In no unhappy mood, but such as, raised Out of the safe serene of common joys, Trembles and shudders at its own delight: And the long whisper of soft fruitful rain Among the tree-tops, roofing in our hearts With shower of beaded tinklings, a cascade And we beneath its arch,—making us full Of moist cool thoughts, and a pure grateful sense Of nameless odours; buoyant with it come Strange gusts of airy freshness, born of Spring. These, and but these,—enough of sound nor more To make the silence sweeter,—linger near; All else is Sabbath—slumber—and the grave. THE SHADOW OF DEATH. Where is the God of holiness and glory, The God of love and steadfast hope serene, Whose grace still threads our earth's dark-woven story With clear primæval tints of lucid green? Where is the peace that passeth understanding— The blue deep shadow of eternity Sleeping on godlike hearts—the sure up-standing Of some calm islet in the wildest sea? They do not come to us, though o'er us nightly The holy moon makes Sabbath in the sky; Though thro' the faint grey-blue for ever brightly Unruffled morrows move with dewless eye: Yet, some divine significance reposes In all we see without, or feel within: Some secret vivid life, that ever closes Its charmed essence to the touch of sin: Some mellower flush in all the dawning splendour Floats its sweet presence unto souls forgiven; Some fragrant coolness, more intensely tender, Dreams thro' the twilight o'er the child of Heaven; Some spell lives in the Book of all the ages— Deep truths arise and precious wisdoms start, And hope and sunshine, from its pregnant pages, Seen thro' the glistering dew-drops of the heart: And each chance mood hath some unthought-of meanings,— Some rippling voice all fitful thrills that stir The soul's dark waters; scant yet worthy gleanings, Making self-knowledge deeper unto her. But wakes for us no clearer sound or crisper Than Sin's dull moan, or Folly's dissonant cries; Save when, at pauses, some dear mocking whisper Creeps thro' the far-off range where hearing dies. O Father, still them, these unhallowed noises! Give us the inner grace that maketh whole; That we may hear those holy mystic voices— Twin gospels of the senses and the soul: That we may feel, the Eternal Spirit aiding, Thy Bible's charm, and Nature's quiet arts; And read, sun-traced in instant hues unfading, The leaden landscape of our own strange hearts. THE POET. I see it now by what I read— The Poet's office in the world: For common men, with toil and greed So strongly round about them curl'd,— With lives too full of wants and work To spare one silent nook for thought, With lips too rude, and souls too murk, To breed clear fancies, e'en if sought,— These yet within their spirits keep, At times, some huge delights and dim Of feeling or of thought, that sweep Serenely over them, and brim Their minds with sweet but formless haze— Then vanish undistill'd away: A melting sunset cloud—a maze Of dizzy tints among the grey— A vagrant dreaminess, that plays With the dumb soul beneath its sway, Then slips behind unseen, nor stays To make a record for the day: 'Tis these for whom the Poet writes— Not for himself alone he builds His vocal bower of calm delights; Not for himself alone he gilds His changeful sea of outer life With answering colours from within: These too he champions in the strife— The holy strife—with wrongs and sin; For these he culls with faultless ear The wild yet meaning harmonies Of things, which all who list may hear,— Born of the earth, and sea, and skies,— And sets them in deep luscious chords, So full, so simple, and so true, So deftly sounded forth in words, That who had heard, now know them too: For these his leader-spirit thinks The thoughts they felt but could not frame; His eye burns clear o'er orient brinks With light from some unrisen flame: And all emotions undescribed, And indistinct and spectral things That graze our meaner minds, unbribed To shed the fragrance from their wings, All these he gathers in his wreath, And gives them shape and gives them hue So well, that some broad name beneath Each kens the several phase he knew: And while his ripening lips distil New truths, new fancies, evermore, Our listening hearts in wonder still Seem full of sounds they knew before; Till some remember'd note of bliss Shoots thro' us with a special stir— “'Tis ours,” we cry, “to feel, but his To be the heart's interpreter!” Such is the Poet's work: and now, What hath the God of Wisdom given Of speech and thought, for earth to know, So like the speech and thought of heaven? How rich with hope and calm to thee, In all thy changeful moods, must come Thine own pure spirit's songs, when we, The stranger-bosoms, call them Home! How dear to find, where'er thou art, Cool sacred Edens for thy feet! How rare the music at thy heart, Which, e'en at distance, is so sweet! Then speak to us thro' days and nights The muffled things we only feel; Move with thy clarion on the heights, And all their tuneful spells reveal. And Thou, who gavest the music, give The docile grace of heart to hear: That scents in every sigh may live, And glints of light on every tear: And let the still prophetic flow From torrent-whirls our souls reclaim, And teach us wisdom, till we grow All of a Poet but the name. PASSING AWAY. Thou shalt not die, sweet poet of the heart, Most gentle wife, whose days are as a sound Of endless music round about my hearth; But thou shalt brighten upward evermore, And still be with us—as the heavenward lark Dies into space, but leaves her voice behind. AN OFFERING. As, when the silver chain of song Thy sweet voice weaves, at every tone Yon harp with sympathetic thrill Sighs forth spontaneous unison; So all thy sorrows pierce my heart With some electric pang divine; So every breath that stirs thy soul An answering ripple wakes in mine. VAGARIES. The crocus dwells in sunset skies, The harebell on the sea; The violet lives in Amy's eyes,— And all for love of me! The linnet hath a pleasant trill Of soft and sober glee; A long sweet note the nightingale Of changeless melody; And low and sad the cushat's moan Within the old yew tree: Our angel gather'd up to heaven The soul of all the three, Till, lapt in sound of spirit-harps, They grew to harmony,— Then breathed them into Amy's voice— And all for love of me! The stars of heaven are suns, the stars Of earth are drops of dew; These glow on cool and shadowy green, And those in liquid blue: But stars shrink into heaven by day, And dew dies on the earth: Only her eyes survive, because They are of nobler birth. Yet there's a soul about the world, If only we could see, That lends their light to stars and dew— But that is not for me; For shadows vex my filmy sight, And damps infect my breath: Are those the ghosts of Amy's eyes, Lighting the road to death? Ah, Memory! In the days of old, How bright they used to be— When I was all to Amy's heart, And she was all to me! THE EREMITES. “It boots not thus to pace the shingly marge Of Life's great ocean, dungeon'd in by cliffs Behind, and forward, the strong restless surge Booming about us—deafening all the soul To those still strains of holy thought she loves: We'll float our worn and batter'd hearts away Over the billows to yon central sea, Grand and deep-shadow'd, where no eye o' the world Intrudes, but only on its face for aye Broods the clear gaze of heaven, enchanting it To sympathetic beauty; every one Of all its changeful sheens and flickering hues Hath had a mother in the sky, and keeps Close to her delicate image, unalloy'd By aught of earth, save filmy transient things That rarely flit between, as if to enhance The blue monotony of loveliness By shades of contrast, and the sweet suspense Of discords in such harmony of light: There, with rich-scented incense-drops of prayer One holiest spot in that lone paradise We'll smoothen for ourselves—a hallow'd ring Of calm lagoon, to muse in and be still!” Dear exquisite seductions! How intense And poignant is the sorrow of our souls, From such a voice when Reason all severe This only lesson draws—How far from twins On the crude Earth are Loveliness and Truth! Truth? She is wrought with Permanence and Repose, To make a whole in Beauty: of such trine, Beloved, in the music of your strain, Alas! there is but one. Yet men's dull ears Have echoed that, and with the doubling sound Peopled the mute chords of the absent twain, And thought 'twas harmony: or haply thought,— Pacing a false and foul and restless world— That truthful Beauty, sure, was all Repose. And who shall blame them, tenants of a time When good was but a lesser evil,—when The trembling heart, cross'd in her arrowy path Of purity by lust and passionate sin, Plunged wildly down some cool chance-proffer'd glade For quiet, and a nearer path to Heaven: A time when weary men, in the hot glare Of bustling toilsome noon distracted, heard Among the half-seen woodlands far away Soft whisper'd sidelong notes, that wooingly Stole o'er their fever'd spirits like a dew;— They did not pause, nor listen if it were Only a Siren's song, or the echoing trail Of melodies by lonely beings made In differing worlds, and floated down to ours Like wondrous aërolites; but all at once, Reckless, and mad with hope and the deep hate Of all behind, they darted on to track Those sweet sounds, saying in their simple hearts “They must be true, because they sing of Peace!” DESPAIR. All the earth is full of sorrow— All the earth is full of fears: Never doth a golden morrow Dawn upon the night of tears! “Doth the morning bring no sunshine? Doth the evening bring no stars? Doth the tender moonlight never Peep between the window-bars?” No—the moonlight hath been dying Long upon the cold blue sea, And the sunlight fiercely flying O'er the dim deserted lea: No—the haggard cheek is ever Moist with sorrow, paled with fears: No—the golden morning never Dawns upon the night of tears! HOPE. No! the stars are not for ever Lost behind the darkening sky; They may pause awhile, but never Cease to light us till we die. Are they not sweet signals, twinkling In the windows of our Home, Thro' the waste around us sprinkling Hopeful thoughts of things to come? What if they be quench'd from o'er thee? Deep within thy closed eyes Faith shall woo them back before thee, Sparkling in unshadow'd skies. What tho' noon's deep blaze be clouded, And the orient splendours gone? Only shall the heavens be shrouded Till the rising of the moon: Then, the glare of day departed, Shall a calm still light be born Dearer to the brokenhearted Than the richest blush of morn. What if thou art worn and weeping? Golden germs of peace and love In thine anguish'd breast are sleeping, Watch'd and water'd from above: E'en tho' yet the harvest lingers, Scarce the tender blades unfold,— Sown by more than angel-fingers, Who shall doubt the ripening gold? Who—while gloom and sin-born sorrow Fade before the unveiling years, Till that clear Eternal Morrow Dawn upon the night of tears. ALMA MATER. Once again within the grey old college, Pillow'd in the mateless student's nest— Nest, where ever broods maternal Knowledge, Best beloved of them that know her best. Thy great children I behold, O Mother, Soaring grandly in the distant skies; Single, yet to thee and one another Bound for aye in closest kindred-ties: They are not departed altogether— They have left a glowing track behind; Light and odours from each dewy feather Of their pinions linger on the wind, Melt into a halo and a glory That above us holds eternal sway, Tinting these time-hallowed courts and hoary With the splendours of a younger day,— Day of pure and heavenward aspirations— Day of clearest sunniest thoughts sublime Wakening all the brotherhood of nations, Gilding e'en the farthest peaks of Time. I am shrined beneath this day of splendour, Hid within this gorgeous noon awhile; Brilliant are its rays—but ah, more tender Is the moonlight of a human smile! Still, for Love there is no mortal heaven— She on Sorrow's thorny pallet lies; For her own soft cradle-nest was riven When the wind first blear'd her opening eyes. Therefore thou art blest, O calm and lonely Wooer of the great Pierian Nine; Spirits mute and gentle, striving only Which shall bring thee rapture most divine: They, their eager hands for ever joining, Fondly cluster round thee and above; In thy hair their varied flowers are twining, In thine eyes their countless looks of love. Therefore 'tis a good thing thus to linger By the crystal fount of light a space, Tracing round its brim with reverent finger All high names that sanctify the place; And from those immortals gone before us Gathering ever hallow'd thoughts and sage, While their spirits' shadows hovering o'er us Flush with riper tints the mellow'd page. Yea—she is a true majestic Mother, And her cloister'd mansions are a home: Search and look—thou shalt not find another Warm as hers in all the days to come: Very sweet her short and tented unions Of the nomad spirits as they rove; Very pleasant her uncheck'd communions, Passing all except a woman's love! Very dear to drink her lonely waters Underneath an oasis of palms, While as yet no sudden fierce avatars Soil our moonlit dews, our fragrant calms; Waters, welling thro' the soft and porous Edge where sward and desert are at strife: Young green years behind—and oh! before us, Scorch'd and bare, the boundless breadth of Life! THE POET'S BRIDE. Thou, so gravely sweet, so mutely tender, Calm with cloudless eyes and brow serene— Thou shalt share with me my throne of splendour, Thou alone shalt be my spirit's queen! Bridal airs shall waft thee up beside me, Woo thee close within my sacred spell: What if all the erring world deride me? Thou shalt view the hermit in his cell— Cell? Believe me, 'tis an amaranth bower Wreathed and woven thicker every day With each freshest moss, each dewiest flower, All to keep the jars of earth away: But toward heaven 'tis open—not enshrouded 'Neath a roof that shuts out all but sin; No, to it the stars are aye unclouded, And the brooding angels aye come in. Such the home I bring thee: not from Fashion Seek I chilling lessons how to woo— Ever for itself each varied passion Moulds afresh the forms of Right and True. Only in my own wild way I'll love thee— All my thoughts and hopes around thee weave— Fold my close and sheltering soul above thee Like a warm transparent cloud of eve. Leaning fondly o'er the inner sluices Whence these lonely rills of thought arise, Thou shalt make their wayward jets and juices Purer with the gazing of thine eyes: Shadows of the Poet's unborn fancies Lengthen forward o'er the Poet's wife; Sweet results of reveries and trances She alone hears whispering into life. But not thus alone—such lofty wooing Suits me only in an hour of song; Human eyes and fingers are undoing All the fancies I had feign'd so long. Teach me then, sweet Bride, what rich employing Love provides for them that use her well; How she flies all transcendental toying— How she spurns each coarse and vulgar spell; How she blesses, if our warp'd hearts let her, All true twins that meet within her shrine— Minds expand and cold reserves unfetter, Life looks larger, Heaven more divine. They may know her best who feel most lonely, Asking help from her as from a star Not for what they do and suffer only, But for that chief secret—what they are; But she is no high and special guerdon Seal'd and shut for such rare souls to prove; Her sweet breast declines no common burden, And the simplest is the truest love. VALENTINE. Alas! for sombre spirits, on whose gaze From that dark Eld loom upward endlessly Huge clouds of sad regretful memories Not yet dissolved by weeping—on whose brows The deep-wrung tears fall scaldingly for aye From wounded hearts in tender mute reproach, And filtering inward soak the shrinking brain, And seethe it into madness—sure for them No lovers' saint from out his vernal shrine Scatters sweet missives; nor, when circles round His festal day of freedom, gives them leave To twine their thoughts in airy phantasies And passionate dreams of blithest mimic love, Such as gay youths and merry maidens wreathe— Like twinkling films of frailest gossamer, Rich with dense dew and rainbow'd thick with light, That sheet the lawn at daybreak—wildly round Each other's hearts, till clearest laughter comes With morn, to chase the shadowy spells away: And if for them some bird of purest wing Should haply on the trellis'd window-sill Alight, and startle the dull moveless air Into strange life, warbling delicious notes Strung by some fair-brow'd stranger far away,— Speak—for thy woman's heart shall tell thee true— Should not such spirits to that lingering bird (Else being bard of such a strain, 'twere caught And clasp'd too near the heart) in whispers say, ‘Fly! and when next above her fragrant bower Who sent thee thou shalt droop thy homeward wing, And half in mute love, half in weariness, Nestle thy panting bosom close to hers,— Then, ere its even swell have hush'd thee quite To slumber, oh, bid Memory sweetly stir The stillness in thy breast and waken thence These notes I give to silence and to thee:— ‘The lake is smooth and glass'd with light— And from thy shallop's side Thou mayst not ken the frequent life That throbs beneath the tide: ‘The mountain-slopes are green and fair— Thou never wouldst believe There dwells a molten flood within Shall drown them all at eve: ‘The ruddy morn breaks cloudlessly Upon thine early eyes; Ah! strange, that storms and gloom should lurk Behind such virgin skies! ‘Half melting into light, half lost Amid the gorgeous west, Lies a rich chaos of sweet hues, All lovely, and at rest: ‘Who thinks, till 'mid the ebbing glow Dark lurid masses rise, E'en eve could bathe the storm-cloud's breast In such a fair disguise? ‘So, tho' on quiet cheek and eye There live no trace of tears, Nor outward throes or heavings mark The uneventful years,— ‘I rede thee trust not such a calm— There may be more of woe And more of horror underneath Than saints like thee can know.’ SCENT AND JEWELS. Lady, why blend these dying sweets With that immortal sweetness all thine own? Why ask of Art her counterfeits— Her languid cloying odours—but to crown That ever-deepening, ever-mellowing bloom Whose very presence is perfume? Dost thou mistrust thine ardent eyes And that deep glow of soul indwelling there, That with these rival galaxies Of glimmering gems thou hast bedew'd thy hair? Or dost thou stoop to those who equal deem The innate lustre and the surface-gleam? The clear starr'd purple overhead Brooks not her virgin trueness should be soil'd With false and fever'd glare and red Of mocking meteors; of their thrones despoiled She shoots them down in scorn, to find i' the Earth Some miry home more level with their birth: So do thou ever prize, like her, The simple majesty of maidenhood; And in calm wrath the odours tear And soulless jewels from thee: upstart brood Unblest! and only let thy cool white brow For ever wear the light of its own stainless snow. FADING STARS. Stars, that have blest our slumbers, and are rapt Into your native silence lovingly, Now that the fresh full-waken'd Morn hath lapt The Earth's moist brow in light and living glee,— Go not alone, but take my heart with you To that divine seclusion into which I see you sinking through the alter'd blue— To depths entranced in soundless calm, or rich With immaterial music; or to where, Past the thick orbing of the worlds, may lie Some sweet and sacred pause, inform'd with prayer And the deep solemn sense that Heaven is nigh: There may I dwell, self-poised on awful wing, Till this ungenial glare of day decrease; Till you, O fading stars, return, and bring The still blue Night, whose other name is Peace! LONELINESS. Were it not well, that 'mid the racking sense Of fierce impatience whilst the uncertain chords Of thought are framing—in the acute suspense Of fancies fluttering still from grasp of words, We should not leave the quivering soul to bear Its quick delirious throbbings all alone, But have some sister-breast, to bosom there— Some other fairer arm beside our own To prop the dizzy brow—some heart to make A softness for us and sweet canopies Of rich transparent hair, and ever slake Our inner thirst with fond down-gazing eyes? Yes: but perhaps the one true breast that kept Thy cheek's cold impress, is not with thee now; Perhaps the brooding eyes that would have wept All warm affection into thine, can know No more, how close the shivering heart doth cling And cluster by the memory of their tears; How many thoughts with unforgetful wing Seek their old nests amid the vernal years: Therefore, whoe'er thou art, thou still shalt wear The outer man that hides the man within; Memory's alike and Fancy's throes shalt bear Alone and unsuspected; and thro' sin And thine accustomed follies move by day, Whilst that eternal sorrow comes with even; Till from the life on earth thou pass away (Grant it, O Saviour!) to the life in Heaven. PACHYS: OR, THE MAN OF SUBSTANCE. You, that, in deepest and prolific beds Of spawning weed, among the sodden floors And shifting miry bottoms of our state Engender'd, like a dream with none to mark Or map the channel of its birth,—do yet, By change of time advanced and urging aids Of science and a freed instructed mind, Edge thro' the striving waters buoyantly, And bubble out at top; to whose unworn And brilliant blazonries of modern dyes, The ancient pennons rotting unawares Thro' centuries along our fretted aisles Yield at a touch, and crumble like a corpse In the strange air; who build majestic homes Far from the poor, of massive jewels glued With golden gums, and having chambers ceil'd And canopied with fragrance, and great halls Faint with all heap'd barbaric loveliness Of carvings and of looms, and sheeny roofs That slope in sheets of silver to the sun; Who stride across an age full half your own With gestures of magnificence, as heirs Of all the days to come, and rich with seeds Of influence and homage and renown Unfolding for you in the future: You, Great Men of Substance! my untutor'd song Assails—for you, O sleek luxurious kings, I have a word of wisdom. Know ye not, Nor ever heard from reverend lips, or voice Of aught that still is noble in yourselves, The excellence of Woman?—how she rules A hemisphere of our humanity, And that the fairer? how i'the very dregs And leavings of her kind there quickens still A spirit which is likest the divine Of all on earth, and bears unfelt results Of influence upon us, and hath grace To sweeten Nature's music,—nor should fail To make an angel purer? Do not all Her low and common ones, which yet abide Unsinning by the cataracts of sin,— Tho' thro' all time they ne'er bethink themselves Of such a mission,—bear upon their brows A living jewel that along the gloom Around them shines for ever, being dropt Out of some saintly coronal above? Do not the ruddy daughters of the field— Tanned village-girls, agape with boisterous glee At haytime or at harvest,—do not they 'Mid labours rude, and ruder joys, and strange Unshrinking love, still thro' the hamlet fling Somewhat of grace and tenderness—of all That marks the peasant from the boor? The wet Wild fisher, with her clotted hair, and cheeks Wind-flush'd to coarsest hues, and all uncouth In hybrid garb, who fills her slimy creel Among the sea-worn rocks, or occupies Her business in the waters,—doth not she About her father's, husband's, spirit shed A sweet unconscious something, all unknown Without her? And the women of the farm— Rough creatures skill'd in each ungentle craft, And moulded for their labour,—or those hordes Of manlike workers, strong and huge, who tread Deep in the miry glebe thro' Autumn rains And blasts of early Spring,—do not all these, And whatsoe'er of womankind is born To sweat i'the sloughs of Life, altho' to us Debased they seem and most unlovely, still Look gentle to their fellows? Do they not Breathe o'er the waste low places of the land A purer air, and thro' the poor man's hut Move like fair spirits, humbled to the place And homely, yet unwittingly divine, Who with low-voiced vesper breezes cool His workday life, and by blind spells, alike To her who wields and him who feels unknown, Thro' dullest throngs of village or of town Some gentler ways inspire, some chaster speech, Some rude but earnest chivalry of soul? And more than these, as with imbruting toil Less stain'd than they—wearing her native grace Scarce dimm'd, the tender maiden all unsoil'd In squalor, pure in thick of swarming sin, Who bears her sorrows all alone, or brings A daughter's, sister's heart to breast the load Of utter want, and still the reeling brain, And buoy the sinking spirit up, and nerve The thin weak hand for work,—doth she not make For those about her and her own clear self An alien presence in that fetid life,— And only less than Heaven's? Is not she, And such as she, the white redeeming thread Wound thro' dark mazes of the people's life, Yea, the chief clue that leads us up to why They are not ruffians yet?...... All this ye know— Ye own it all,—own that the flow or ebb Of Woman marks the better or the worse In social being: how then do ye dare To plant your griping talons in her neck And force her down to bondage? How coop up To unrelenting tasks her young fond soul That should evangelize the world,—until The sensitive spirit and the slender frame Pine to the death together?—Or if Heaven And the rude winds have made her coarse, how grind Her honest roughness down to the level flint Of brutish apathy, whilst some obscene Unsexing influence, born of you and gold, (Haply the maddening mill's barbaric horde, Or—no not now—the harness and the yoke,) Doth bravely mould her, till to wedded life She pass—meet spouse for England's present day, Meet mother for her future!...... But perchance 'Tis that our eyes may mark some hidden phase Of the soul's truth, and read intensely clear That not romance makes up the loveliness Of Woman's sorrow: not the oft-told tale Of nursed and petted grace unsphered, and sunk To bitter memory of her rightful state, Doth glorify affliction, and give light To all her weeping; ye would teach us how— Stript of such tawdry aids, and standing bare And all unkempt, a woman's woe doth still Make e'en uncleanness loveable, and crown With sanctity the vilest lot, and give An agonizing beauty to the sight Of grief, for him who hides not from his heart All that should make a man. We give you thanks, O Men of Substance, for the lesson—for The unconscious voice, that bids us purge our hearts And look on Woman by the zenith-light Of that great catholic spirit, whose broad wings Are over us. Our fathers did not so— Theirs was a narrow sympathy; what else Of her might grieve they heeded not, but kept Their maudlin lays for “Beauty in distress,” And called that pity! Thanks to you and gold, We read her better now: we know from you That she may sound each depth of suffering And degradation—may sob out her heart To pitiless Fashion—tend the grim machine An unregarded slave—or toil with brutes I' the oozy mine, and still be Woman, still Be a true daughter of the ideal Eve. O men of true-born blood and hearts as true! Can ye then look around, nor cease to mourn As if the days of chivalry, and all That stalwart age of knighthood, were no more? They are not dead—the men of substance, they Who twine their tinsel chaplets mockingly Round the helm'd forehead of the Middle Age,— Whose tread is in your feudal halls, to scare The spirits of your fathers,—who have torn From the mail'd steed his housings, and where once The lawful rider sat serenely, now Climb awkward to the saddle, prompt to rush Presumptuous thro' the future (may they spare Our children on the pathway!)—these have kept, Spite of themselves, the old heroic times Enshrined within the Present, changeless all In spirit, but in significance, and scope, And purpose, broaden'd with the broadening souls And wisdom of the ages. Therefore come, Whose fathers in the caverns of the Past Gleam from high niches like the bearded saints Grooved in cathedral aisles—whose lavish blood To bards is dear, and antique chroniclers, And pilgrims to the father-lands of Eld;— Behold, the day of chivalry is here, And we are champions still! Fair ministers— Fair ladies which are loving to your kind— Be near, and gird us for our high emprise; Snatch from their nooks the old crusader-shields, Unloop the massy sword, the vizor'd casque Fit with its idle plume, and tenderly Sling o'er blood-blazon'd tunic and swart mail The jewell'd baldric, and the impatient heel Wing with bright barbs of speed! From citadels And bastion'd keeps, wherein the manly soul Broods like a pillar'd prophet o'er his age, We will sweep down, as from the polar gulfs Those old invaders, thro' all bubbling sloughs And steamy stiff morasses, where at ease The gorged luxurious Mammon in his den Rolls royally, while thickest selfish stench Pants thro' his unctuous carcase. Suddenly, Scented afar and storm'd as soon as seen, A thousand furious lances shall find rest, Cushion'd in him; and the slow dribbling blood Oozing thro' gash and puncture like a slime, And fat delicious layers of rich flesh That cased him in from his humanity, Shall feed a world of poor. And chiefly them, His helpless herds of weak imbruted slaves That moving gently thro' a native sphere Might have been women,—and each toiling girl Who in bare garret centres thro' her eyes The sad remainder of a bruised heart On some smear'd shrivell'd flower, from her fair Fresh home among the mountains brought to die Upon the blacken'd sill, and likens it (How truly!) to herself,—and most of all, Such tender spirits in rude villages Or crowded lanes by that impartial Hand Sown for a seed of beauty—to stand out Like stars upon the dull dark atmosphere Of vulgar life, and hallow it with good— To stay and blind the brute assault of sin And degradation, like those messengers For that old saint in Sodom,—yet whom he, The vile seducer, marring with foul touch Love's work—defying, as in blasphemy, The purposes of God—and killing all That blessed growth of influence in the world With pestilent spume of lust, did mutilate And strike from their high orbits and decoy And drag and drive unutterably down Thro' long remorse, to wallow far below All hope, all comfort, blasted into fiends;— These, O true friends, and every sisterhood Of sorrow such as they, and whatsoe'er Is soil'd and sprent with rank offensive mire Foam'd from the wheels of Death, we will arouse To new existence, and from their dry hearts Strike sounds melodious,—as the steps of Spring Crunch a crisp music out of all dead leaves Of Autumn: tender knightly wanderers, Each with a rescued maiden in his arms, We thro' thick mists will bear them lovingly, And soaking marishes, by many a gorge Into the Orient—a brave pageantry, Whereof the van is moving even now Across the Atlantic waters,—and behold! Their leader is a woman. Not ungirt, Crusaders of the Future, we will move, With minstrels high and troubadours, to keep The electric glow still vivid at our hearts And catch from far upon expectant harps Some earnest of an unborn chorus-burst, Hymning the fall of Wrong. And haply then Shall some more gentle warbler and more young Rouse his meek lyre, and with no heedless hand Set in sad song the wailings of the poor,— Shaking the troubled music from his strings In tearful dews of passion such as these:— “Is it no more, O Masters of the Earth, That Woman is a saint? No more she cools Her thoughtful temples, gathers up no more The thick ripe clusters of her fragrant curls With wreaths of moist valerian, nor hath leave To tint the wavy glosses of her hair With orange glows of lustrous marigolds, And steep and hallow her sweet eyes at will In the full blessings of the mountain-glens? Is she a joy of nations—a delight To them that know their manhood's excellence— A mother of all greatness—a true nurse Of all that is not sinful in the world?— Yea—she shall not be damn'd: she shall not lie And wince beneath your grinding Juggernaut, Like Indian serfs, for ever: she shall rise Into the throne appointed her of God, Into the throne of Love. O Men of Wealth, This is your truest peace—to purify And brighten her into a very type Of that great sea of crystal nigh the Throne: For us,—behold, our manhood and our might Each in her hand—the colours of our life Are wooft with hers for ever. Crush us then Out of the rank of brothers; set the staunch Serene endurance of an English heart To stubborn hate; array our very loves And pure affections and humanities Like tempting fiends against us; let the teeth Of famine gnaw at all true tendrils old That bind us to our nation and to you, And eat the lingering heaven out of our souls With utterest affliction: but beware— Degrade not Woman from the silver car Whereon she sits, a lunar queen of love, And moves abreast of sorrow as it comes To blink or all eclipse it; be afraid At least of this, if ye would have us still Be men and Christians, or would keep the sick And reeling Earth from being more of hell.” ST. MARY'S. The glory of the ancient days Hath crept thro' darkness, but we feel Its soft reviving bloom: Again the rich bewilder'd blaze Of tints is o'er you as ye kneel Within your Sabbath-home. The crust of sloth is gone, the vile Excrescences, and all that told A dull, neglectful age; Serenely down each shadow'd aisle Ye worship as your sires of old, And woo the prayerful page, And list perennial teachings dear, And trace, O steadfast souls and true, The ancient praises' chime: All the old charms are here, but bear Their freshest youth again for you— “Light at the evening-time.” O nest where hallow'd thoughts and prayers Have garner'd, from the days of old,— Still in thy newer guise Be thou a home for all that wears The look of heaven—a crowded fold Of saintly memories! O temple of the Changeless One, Who, with thy sister fanes, dost preach Stability in change,— Still stand, and see the Gospel sun Grow brighter toward the west, and teach Our hearts a nobler range: Stand thro' the veering times—the crash And hurry, as the thickening years Throng upward to the goal; And see baptizing billows wash The nations into hope from tears, And see the scared mist roll. And when the giant morn that grows Thro' paling dusk from day to day Shall bring unclouded Truth, Be thou too there, thy reverend brows Flush'd with a mother's pride, and say With accents as in youth— “The rich grass of my children's graves Slopes thick between me and the sea,— And each beloved name I knew, has floated o'er the waves Within that better Home to be— But I am still the same.” LETHE. Not always with the summer air Blend the faint whispers of the birds: Not always the pure soul of Prayer Incarnate grows in words: Not always doth fair Music give Her inspirations unto sound— Her sweetest lays within her live, All voiceless and profound. So thro' the soul not always march The serried thoughts in dense array, Nor echoes ring thro' Memory's arch When they have pass'd away; But oft the yielding spirit sleeps Entranced in some unconscious bliss— Swooning within ecstatic deeps Where only silence is: Or if there ripple o'er the lake Dim shades of things once thought or spoken, The outer calm may thrill and break— The inner is unbroken. Sometimes too, colourless and blind, And almost to itself unknown, Dwells the dull chaos of the mind All silent and alone; And in that vacant gloom, untaught To watch its heavings or reveal, Forgets the quiet pulse of thought, And what it is to feel. Is this, O holy Mournfulness— Companion of the falling leaves And all that wears an Autumn dress— The state of one who grieves? Perhaps thy timid sorrowing heart The dimness of thine eyes would hide, And e'en the knowledge that thou art, Beneath that ‘sullen void:’ Ah, let us feel that this is so, By some deep sigh, or sob, or tear, Which to the doubting heart may show She is not insincere! IRENE. Dark is her spirit—dark, and strangely sweet— Most like the clear bronze twilight of the sea; And stirless all and smooth, without a beat In the calm tide that flows for only me. There no swift-rippling phantasies of light With fleeting films the quiet surface wreathe; No splendid dazzling sheens, opaquely bright, Veil the pure shadow'd stillness underneath: And all the inner with the outer blends— Melts thro' it as the sunshine thro' the skies; And lends the clear white to her brow, and lends The deep transparent richness to her eyes. Silence is with her—silence full of prayer And thoughts that slowly make her more divine; The while she sits alone, serenely fair, And dreams her tender spirit into mine. [From month to month I come, from year] From month to month I come, from year To darken'd year I come and go; And still I ask if thou be here, And none doth answer Yes or No: The house doth stand unchanged, and hear Its wonted tread of thronging men: So little doth our outward gear Reck of the fretful change within! Still slides the water, slow and sere, And, eddying onward to the foss, Breaks o'er it foaming—but I hear No sound therein of change or loss: All things their ancient semblance wear— But faint misgivings at my heart Do thro' the husk the kernel tear, And ask impassion'd where thou art; For that unconscious presence dear That tints and flushes all we see— The sense that something loved is near— Doth haunt the place no more for me: And where above the blind thy clear Deep eyes did nurse their sweets unseen Till I should pass, strange myrtles rear Their shade, with mocking flowers between. Oh, if one keener stroke doth shear And shred their blossoms from the hours, 'Tis, that I feel thou art not here, And that the thought is born of flowers. AN APOLOGY. Whoso pollutes the sacred stream of song With sullied rills from fountains less divine Than hers, or slakes her lucid waters pure To the red hue of lust, himself hath torn The white crest from his dinted helm, and nail'd The baton to his shield: but yet 'tis meet That in these latter days the virgin Muse Should not for ever keep those imaged stars On her clear face, and bosom'd 'neath the moon Unveil her beauties to the kindred blue Above; nor alway glide by hamlets green And rims of beaded flowers: 'tis meet that she Through giant homes of men should sweep at times— Thick towns and teeming cities—nor denay That stir and splash should mar her deep repose; With crowds around and mists above should lose All but herself of heaven; herself, the one Bright clue that threads the damp, dark maze of life: 'Tis meet that she from blooming banks descend At times, to gush with full resistless flood Thro' some Augean den—not made less pure By that foul channel, but transmuting it To purity: 'tis meet the maiden-muse Should from her secret fathomless home descend At times, and with her own sweet thoughts awhile Forget to commune; sailing meekly down In humbler guise, as one who knows to tread The earth, tho' rear'd in heaven; should thro' blind haunts And hovels where the reeking human swarm Fret out scant lives of sorrow or of sin, Untended, move; yet not without a train Of ministering angels, to redeem With incense and a spirit-glow the rout Of horrid sights and sounds, that so unscathed She thro' the fetid air may glide, and mark With tears, and learn, and in her burning heart Digest the knowledge into some full tide Of strong indignant verse,—not floating smooth O'er her foul theme, nor drowning with soft plash The roar of sin, but with the fever'd wrath And deep prophetic daring in her breast Of innocence, still dashing up to the light All nauseous weeds and loathsome slimy things That rot beneath the surface; gallantly She sweeps them bubbling up into the full Stern glare of sunshine, till her royal soul Flood the stark world with fury, kindling it To purer life by shame. Who faints at this, Or scorns to quit the cool seductive shade At times, where gentlest Music dwells with Love,— His is no queenly muse Pierian, sphered On deathless throne sublime, but some thin shade Of timid Echo, who i' the shelter'd glen Crouching, pipes out her maudlin strains, unfit For gods to sing, or godlike men to hear. SIMILES. Sweet is the rose-flush melting thro' the blue At early evening—first and tenderest hue Of that bright brood that in the dazzling deeps Of utter light is born, and fluttering creeps Into a bolder being, till its nest Warms to the cluster'd ripeness of the West: Sweet is the mellow coolness underived That swims about the Earth ere she hath hived Her scatter'd fragrance for the night, and fills The little sleepy glens between the hills, And lingers by all whispering brooks unseen, And dreams o'er grey-blue downs, that towards it lean So wooingly aslope; and alway lends Its solemn hush to every heart that blends With Nature's in true love,—what time the grand Wide reach of throbbing blue on every hand Deepens and darkens upward endlessly Thro' zones of lessening stars, and when they die I' the unimagin'd depths, still, onward driven Into the soul of space, soars purpling up to heaven: Sweet is the chasten'd amber dusk that lies, With silence in its bosom, o'er the eyes Of Nature, when her vivid flush of praise Hath ceased with sunset; thickening thro' the blaze Dim hues of prayer her shadow'd features steep Unfelt, and stilly lead her down toward sleep Dew-benison'd of Heaven, wherein clear streams Of fostering moonlight hallow all her dreams: Sweet is the first faint rising of a star Between the dying sunlight and the far Thick-dazzled blue beyond; in all the blind Unconscious dimness round, a one defined Sure spot for Thought to grasp, and gazing watch It brighten, till all darken'd glories catch Outline and substance from the chaos-gloom Again, and slowly, singly disentomb And concentrate their special selves, and stand In individual clearness—a fair band Of crowded loveliness, not fused, nor quite Distinct and edged with sharp unquivering light, But 'mid soft breadths of holy vagueness borne Into the bosom of the expectant Morn:— These things, O tender placid nun, all these For thy calm eyes make choicest similes; But chiefly this—for how serenely sweet The lifting of thine eyelids when we meet (If we should meet again as erst)—their slow And mute upraising, till the artless glow Dawns of soft-shaded blue, brimm'd full and clear With some rich fluid, that had seemed a tear But that thy lips belie it (Ah not now, Forgive me!)—with no laughing joy, for thou Dost seldom bask in the wild glare of mirth,— But with a trembling grace, a faint half-birth, A nameless presence, born i' the depths of love And as its home etherial, which doth move And blindly skim about thy lips awhile, Nor deign to grow incarnate in a smile! Oh that no darker, rainier clouds did swim Over the sunset blue, and make it dim With alien gloom! Oh that no winds uncouth Did sweep her unborn kisses from the mouth Of brooding Eve, which for the eager Earth Were ripening! That no tints of coarser birth Darken'd the crystal twilight, nor the stars Did rise unseen, or let the cold grey bars Of weltering mist their sweetest looks absorb! Oh that thine eyes of light did ceaseless orb In the moist coolness of their own calm spheres, Nor ever feel the scorching glow of tears! EOS. Ken'st thou how the elder ages Loved the fresh poetic Morn, Learnt from priests and poet-sages How divinely she is born? Still to us the ancient warning Speaks, as once it spoke to them— “Let the forehead of the Morning Wear thy spirit's grandest gem.” Meetest brow is hers to glisten Jewell'd with the mind's clear prime; Meetest ear is hers to listen Unto Thought's deep manly chime. Noon?—Not softest breeze and tender Lives beneath her royal sway; In her lucid dazzling splendour Dies thy jewel's fainter ray. Eve?—Thy warblings may not greet her; She must sing, and only she: Let no gem, but something sweeter On her brow thy signet be. Night?—The bulbul's voice around her Threads the silence all alone: She with beaded worlds hath crown'd her— Shut thy tiny casket down! But the Morn, tho' brighter, bluer Be her sister-hours, for thee Loving studious calm, a truer Partner of thy thoughts shall be: She, ungirt with stars, or zoned Sunset, or the noonday sheen, Well shall wear thy jewel, throned On her moist pale brow serene: She, with no rude voice to grieve her, Blends thy spirit's nobler lays With the songs that never leave her— With the lavrock's voice of praise. Therefore thou art wise, in choosing Morn thy bloom of thought to prove; Noon for rest, and Eve for musing, And the Night of stars for love. LIKE TO LIKE. Thou canst not fill my better self with love, Nor be to my true heart of hearts a bride— Woman, who bearest all thou hast of grace And loveliness and womanhood about Thy palpable exterior, nor dost leave To him who wooes thee with inquiring eyes And something more than lust, the mystery And sweet suspense of search—the long-drawn thrill Of joy, as ever by the mazy path Some glad assurance brightens out of hope, Up to the glorious bourne: joy such as waits On stainless hearts alone and wise, who know Because they love, and love because they know. Whether, in cottage or in kitchen bred, Thy spirit be but fashion'd to thy lot And to thy frame made coarse, by Him who fits The worker to the work, and from the hand Of Labour hides its own unseemliness: Or whether on the uplands, where pure Thought Blows fresh and full upon thee, and thy place Doth force thee from the sun of Intellect To catch some surface-brightness,—whether here Thou still be stolid, sensuous, and obese Of spirit, lengthening o'er the zenith-blaze Great morning-shadows—making part of that Insipid mass that gives to every taste A rarer sweetness,—if there be, in whom Some purer craving yet abides, unchoked By drifting avalanche, and gusts of sin, And noisy commerce with the thick high-roads, How can such love suffice?—Go, spend on souls Abreast of thine thy tenderness, and leave Me to my truer knowledge (knowledge oft, Alas! unblossom'd into act) of how Contemptible thy deepest worth,—how vile When thou, immortal Woman, with vain toys And transient shows of sense canst thus decoy And cheat the sovereign spirit, and, unshamed Making thine outer than thine inner self More winsome, so canst charm the guerdon-crown Of love and honour from immortal Man! What tho' my fingers thro' rich ravell'd hair Wander deliciously, and lose themselves 'Mid softest clusters of thick curls,—what tho' My hot lips skim the bloom from some sweet face, And sip bewildering kisses as they go,— What tho' I fondly move my lingering touch Down lovesome arms, and secret bosoms warm With love and throbbing with delight,—what tho' I wheel around the edge of wantonness, And boldly brush the darkening skirts of sin?— An hour of pleasures such as these, and I Have learnt thy charms by heart: what then? They know No fair dissolving changes, like the mind's; But—tho' the artistic skill to shape and wreathe And set anew, and weave transforming guise Be thine—for ever dwell in sameness, till They droop toward worse; and who would stay to watch The ebbing tide, who mark'd it at the full? ADELPHE. O tender youngling of the flock, 'twixt whom And me no bright entrancing bonds may live Of mutual thought and close fraternal love, Ripening thro' happy interchange of deep Large secrets, and the intimate communing Of equal spirits; who to me dost prove Only a petted plaything, to be kiss'd And fondled with quaint pranks of babyhood; Who windest sunny flowers about my heart, But where no warmth for the cold winter-time Nor comfort dwells: how can I choose but wish That thee some earlier birth and near my own Had lighted up from the other life to this! So hadst thou been to me a nest for all My timid speechless thoughts, which from thy fond Discourse and that dear fostering neighbourhood Had caught expressive voicefulness unknown Before; so hadst thou been a quiet tarn Where pent-up feelings had gush'd forth and slept Themselves to peace in its sweet sympathy; My crown of joys hadst been, and in all grief The oblivious poppy over aching brows, Moist with cool-dropping kisses, thou hadst twined. O chiefly blest—whether in ingle nook Or banner'd hall or warm luxurious room— Who find around the loved paternal hearth Some one twin-spirit, dearer than the rest As likest to their own,—with whom apart, Nursing her trusted face, to sit and feel Each other's thoughts, till from the silence grow Low earnest whispers, deepening thro' long eves Of twilight intercourse and loving talk Most unreserved and holy! Surely this Is Love's delight indeed,—by thought of self Or passion'd touch unstain'd. O once there came Near me a gentle girl,—a child in years, But with the golden earnest of her prime Most rich about her—looking like the dream Of a fair Future, all the more divine As yet unmoulded into shape and free For Fancy's ripening touch to dash new tints And graces o'er the undevelop'd whole: She, being at rest, did dwell apart from thought, Possess'd of passive beauty and a vague Large heaven of unexerted love—a crude Chaotic Eden, where no creature was, But all fair things were just about to be, And holy thoughts and good were evermore In motion to be born; but, when she spoke, The silent light within her honied eyes Grew speechful, kindling upward as it felt A quickening soul, and, looking out between Long dimpling waves of rich untrammell'd hair, Awoke the slumbering sweetness of her mouth To some expressive meaning sweeter still. Her by the craggy margin of the sea My mated steps did lead; a gentle thing, And most refreshing to the weary sense Cloy'd with thick glut of creatures all untrue And erring, who, in fairest excellent guise Boasting to train their fragrant womanhood And feed its large capacities to life Most full, most pure, most delicate, do yet For not a part in all their complex selves Owe suit to Nature! Not with eyes like theirs She look'd across my face into the blue, And watch'd the pleasant lights arise and move Along its waters, rippling to the shore, And smiled to see how beautiful the Earth Did make herself, smoothing and silencing Her ruffled charms, and rising thro' her soil'd Hot robes against the coming of the Night,— And wonder'd if there could be any joys That lived away from these and dared not come To shame their bliss beside them. Thus with blithe And girlish talk we shorten'd the sweet length Of sward upon the cliff; and evermore By conscious slides inwoven stealthily, She in the rounded hollow of my arm Was half enwrapt, nor sought to move away. Then did I probe more deep toward the core Of her dear nature, trenching bold and far On the grim bounds of common intercourse; And spake of sisters and a sister's love, And spake of brothers and a brother's needs, And how the young affections and the fond Instinctive bias of their unripe souls Centre in her; and upward, how the large Fair workings out and due developments Of all within them lives of good and pure, From opening childhood to the dawn of Love— Yea and beyond—are minister'd of her. Thus I—nor more; for then I did perceive Within the artless meek simplicity Of her sweet acts a new existence rise,— An inner strange reluctance—a decline, Faint and most vague, from that close confidence Wherein we revell'd. Ah, I saw it born— Not yet a thought, but only like the pause 'Ere Feeling changes,—saw it rise, and soon Over the fair horizon of her brows Blush into consciousness. It was the voice Of one that cried in the rich wilderness Of her young heart concerning things to come: Strange things, that made her shudder with delight, And quake with doubt and dread: 'twas the thick breath Of tropic airs, or shreds of wondrous things That floated on the waves about her soul And prophesied new worlds: it was a range Of busy shadows in the lively clouds, Telling of deeds that in some far-off zone The round earth hides. Oh, she nor knew the voice, Nor kenn'd the warm exotic gusts, nor read The meaning of those spectres in the clouds: But I knew—thro' her green full-foliaged life, Twinkling with starry fruit to the quick winds And promise ever-new, I saw it glide— The lean lithe snake—and in her glowing ear Hiss the new knowledge which in this our land, Like a mad mother, leaves its proper child The foundling Modesty, and slinks away To suckle broods of stiff Proprieties,— A sickly spawn and heated into life Apart from nature: hiss thro' her hot ear The first faint thought of coming Womanhood. She knew that she was naked—she perceived That like a veilless Venus she had stood, Not unadored, before me. The black truth Was rousing all that never woke before— All false refinement, all remember'd rules Till then unknown, and kneading all things up To shame within her; But with stern resolve, Ere she had wove the near obsequious words To a scant garment, and array'd herself In tatters of convention, I swept off My clinging soul from hers, and rising up Like a young storm upon the mountains, crush'd My bruised hopes into atoms at a stroke: And with no pitiless eyes, but full of mute Indignant sorrow, and strong self-reproach That any yearnings should have hoisted sail I' the teeth of prudence, silent moved away Toward mine ancient dwelling in the tombs. O little sister, not unlike to her Thou shalt arise—but lovelier unto me, In that thou art for evermore a friend: Thee from the chaos of thy babyhood And this blind feeble working to and fro Of undevelopt natures, our strong hands Shall lift with odours and blithe minstrelsy Into the zones of order and repose; Not soulless order, stagnant dull repose, But such wherein the patient faculties, Woo'd of congenial atmosphere serene, May grow to symmetry. Thy spirit thus Shall fructify and prosper, like a thought Within a human soul, ‘Like a thought Within a poet's soul.’ Alex. Smith. that hath its birth Upon the godlike hills, and is wrought out By meditation and intent desire To something heavenlier still. All lovelinesses That dwell upon the face and on the limbs Shall come and cluster round thee like a hive Of vernal bees; in light and elegance And pure nobility, the fair Greek forms Repeat themselves in thee; nor only thus, But all the secret sculptors from within Shall shape thy lucid features and thine eyes To more intelligent beauty; and untaught, I' the growth of understanding, shalt thou be, And slow unconscious budding of the mind, To clasp the feet of patronising gods And send thy helpless soul incessant up In steams of adulation; nor allow The bulk of Knowledge to o'ershadow thee And in the warm and hissing vase of Life Foam out her frigid fountains without stint Method or law: Beloved, thou shalt learn To think—to give a reason of all loves And young opinions cooling o'er thy soul; To cull with wisest fingers and discreet The scatter'd worth of books and scenes and men, And range them round a Central Principle, Elect and precious, lasting, sure, divine,— And spread them softly under thee, until In every nook and corner of thy heart Pillow'd on some sweet truth thou mayst abide, And be at rest for ever. Having grown Thus patiently and pure, until thy face, Coming and wooing for the nightly kiss, Ask scarce a bend, nor need our loving lips Stoop far to melt and soften against thine,— Thou shalt discourse at quiet times with me Concerning things of old—the excellence And fair proportion of thine upward course— The truths thou knowest, or wouldst know—the glints Of glory that have shot across thy soul Out of the early dark, which doth evolve New orbs and sudden comets evermore Upon thy keener gaze; shalt touch again The blithe quick bells of childhood, and with joy Rain the sweet memories from thy soul like tears Into the lap of mine; unfolding too Whate'er thou hast of purpose and of hope— Fair seedlings of that unborn coronal The years do string for thee. And 'ere we cease And part, perchance with silverest voice serene Of girlish gratitude thou shalt declare ‘I knew not then, but now I dearly know The meaning of thy love—how tenderly We two have grown inwoven, till at length Thou art a best of brothers to my heart, And I a perfect sister unto thee.’ THE PRISONERS OF HOPE. Dry, gasping lips, that still are dumb, Nor speak the words within them lie,— And crude and wayward thoughts, that come Up to the birth, and mocking die,— Strong consciousness of self, and yet Wild plungings thro' the deeps below To seek self-knowledge, which but fret Still more the fruitless itch to know;— And oft a faint and twilight time When the dull whirling round of things Distracts, and o'er the mental prime Lethargic dimness creeps, while sings The one fierce thought that lurks behind— ‘How stagnant all thy spirit is! When shall it feel the freshening wind?’ This is their life, and such as this The vague unrest wherein they dwell: And Love is hid—or if he dare In happier mood to leave his cell, Some face with fixt reproachful stare Doth freeze him back to self again: And Friendship is an after-bloom, A voice that speaks too late, in vain, When mute response can only come From palsied lip and speechless eye: ‘Oh that some woman's heart might prove For us’—their thoughtless yearnings sigh— ‘The sweets without the sin of Love! Oh that some gentler sympathy And more profound than man's, might bring Our mateless thoughts at home to be Under the shadow of its wing!’ But Woman knows no middle state Betwixt the stranger and the wife,— She moves with swift and conscious gait From coldness to the partner-life That Passion breeds; and all unseen Meanwhile, the fruitful fallow lies Of calm and sexless love between: Alas, what tender harmonies And strengthening converse might have grown Where Fashion's senseless dribblings fall And case the listening heart in stone! Thus these strange hopes are vain, and all Have bourgeon'd to ungenial air— Some heart too young, too blithe, too crude To read aright, or reading, share Each riper phase of thought and mood That lies beyond it or above:— They shrink into themselves, to deem That Friendship with the face of Love Is but the angel of a dream, Whereby no godlike charm is rife (As thro' that statue moved of old) To crown the dumb idea with life, And 'neath a kindred guise enfold Within their longing arms the joys of yore— Which in their own sweet name 'tis theirs to feel no more. SYMPATHY. Now the summer deepens into autumn, Now the night creeps forward thro' the day, Blots her freshness from the tender twilight, Dulls her burning orange into grey: Now the morn, and now the untimely sunset Nestles closer towards a faded noon; Swathed in lengths of mist the sad earth vainly Lies awake and hearkens for the moon: And the eastern hails the western darkness O'er that slender space of light between; And chill Nature weeps alone, and nurses Ailing flowers that on her breast do lean: Still the ancient sea is near us moving, Changing ever as our spirits change: Dimmer lights it wears, and colder shadows, And our hearts too take a sadder range: Ceaseless heave and burst the fretful billows, Ceaseless knead the blank and sandy shore; So new thoughts and moods within me working All my soul are kneading evermore. Oh, the autumnal earth is dark and wondrous— Changeful as the mystic life within; Life, or flush'd with shallow glee, with sorrow Stunn'd, or reeling, drunk with lawless sin! Crush'd between the dead joys and the dying, We may well be dizzy, faint, and sere: But a far light belts the blue horizon, And a spring looks upward thro' the year. THE DANCERS. Beneath a serried firmament of light And floods of ceaseless music, they swept on In luxury of wreathed motions, free And most bewitching to the sense of those Who weave them; and the while they moved, a glaze Of stedfast smiles was on their faces, born Of complaisance, or shallow if sincere: And their skill'd lips did not refrain to speak Of tender things, and make unblushingly Bold dalliance with the sacred name of Love, And swing upon her golden gates, and peer Thro' the bright portal of her mysteries,— Nor mean to enter in. I too with girls Of that fair throng did mate me and strike out In wild erratic orbits like the rest; And all my brain was full of fiery sounds And inspiration of the thickening rout Wherein I circled, breeding staunch resolve To do and dare among the best—to be The gayest bubble on the waves of mirth, The blithest mask in all her carnival; Yet in some secret calmness did my soul Unruffled muse, and even in the mid-heat And core o' the whirlwind, gather'd leave to think On all she felt and saw, and sorrowing ask— E'en of the fulness of her own delight— If this were joy, or aught akin to Heaven? Thou too, she said, who cleavest unto me So close that all thy bosom's pantings feel For nearness like my own,—on whose white brow And fragrant tresses doth my hot breath rove And wander freely down to mix with thine,— Thou who dost yield thy being to my grasp, And shape thine every motion unto mine, And let me steer and whirl thee as I list Among the seething crowd,—Are these things fraught With joy for thee—such joy as woman's heart May feel still mounting upward till it brim Her total Being, and take rank with those Great calm delights of senses or of soul That make a spirit's bliss?—Ah, some still voice From thy own woods and lawns, and from the blue And quiet water, and that old grey church, And all home-sweets, shall sadly whisper No! Thou hast no portion in my heart, and I Have less in thine: then wherefore do I fold My stranger-arms about thee,—wherefore feel This thrilling touch so close? For why should I Drink the full fragrance of thy loveliness, Be nestled at its very heart, and shrined Hard by the sacred presence of thy charms? Why ope thy lavish treasures thus so wide To all, and keep so few peculiar gems Within thy casket for the grasp of Love? Where is the cavern'd well-spring at thy soul's Most central depths, whereto none else but one Should wind his way by lonesome alleys sweet, And there abide, and drink his fill for aye? Ah, it is choked—else thou hadst spared to make These happy guerdons of a life of love The playthings of an hour. Howbeit, 'tis well: Ye mean it not; and also unto me These martial bursts that launch your wizard feet Upon the dance, and float them there at will, Do oft strike inward to the heart, and find Some echo there that tells them it is home. For I should scorn to hold (as most unmatch'd With the pure catholic spirit, that expands In broadest love intelligent, yet keeps Unsoil'd the holy blazon on its breast) That these things fit not with the child of God— That it is meet i' the bubbling heart of youth To shut these tiny valves, and seal it down To mawkish dulness and the stiff constraint Of soulless tasks, breeding disgust which thence Indignant swelling, bursts in stormy sin. Who knows not, 'tis the inner spirit, the quick Conceiving impulse, and the prime intent, That lifts to right, or forces down to wrong, These level deeds,—that fills these faint cartoons With sunniest lights, or shadows of the grave? Yea, and 'tis well that we should rise at times From the dark crypts of what we are, and thus Live on the surface of ourselves awhile, Forgetting all beneath. Ah chiefly blest, Who dwell for ever there, or lightly rise Unclogg'd by tangling weeds below, and swim Their buoyant souls aloft most gallantly, Nor have forgotten how they may forget. BE STILL. Peace, ruffled soul! Though shadows o'er thy brain Pass dark and frequent, of all changeful ills We know—though deep indignant sorrows stain Thine eyes in secret—though for ever thrills Along the skirts and shallows of thy mind A lengthen'd sound of lighter griefs, a moan Of chafed and fretted feelings or of blind Vague thoughts of Life, that haunt us when alone: Yet art thou blest, yet is thy fortress sure, O craven warder! One strong matchless key Locks thy vext heart to royal peace secure,— For who shall wrest thine own sweet thoughts from thee? THE MOURNER. She dwelt deep-cloister'd in her heart, And moved not lightly out from thence, But ever trode the perfect part Of mute and holy penitence: Some fleeting sorrows faint may freeze Their vulgar essence into words— Some griefs may lull themselves to ease In song, and die upon the chords,— But hers was vaguely great and rare, Within no narrow phase defined; Was too intense and deep to bear The thrall of limit or of kind: So wept she, as she did not weep,— So spake, as though she had not spoken: Only the bed where she did sleep Knew that her heart was broken! ONE OF TWO. There is an outward life of act and speech, A palpable existence, which doth find Its home upon the highways of the land, And works with men and things, amid the throng Who keep the great world moving: from the first It grasps at knowledge everywise, and wrings From Science and her thousand sprites, and from The army of the Ancients, worthy boons Of light and learning: why? ‘They are most fair, And shall be useful:’ thus advantaged It ripens up to act, and ever sets And cools its massive spirit to the mould It should assume: then, on its chosen track O'er the great waters (chosen with a prompt Undoubting fiat) bears its treasures forth Of crude material, ready for the touch Of Need to perfect,—with skill'd steps and sure From phase to phase of changeful circumstance Moving; and slowly gathers as it goes A household round it, in the which it stands A noble centre,—not untinged with love, But knit and braced for nervous deeds: and thus Wheel round its fruitful periods, and it dies. This is the life, which having largest kin Among the people,—being like to theirs Save in degree—a hedge-row flower, but changed By fuller bloom and richness of the soil, Bears on its forehead all clear gems of praise, And on its breast the cordons of renown; And marches grandly up to the topmost ridge Where queened Glory sits and portions out Her motley guerdons to the sons of men; And carves immortal letters of its own Deep in the soft young Future, with herself To grow, and widen into fame; and wears The sombre splendours of the schools, and wins To fairer seeming and to nobler ends The Majesty of Law,—or where the old Dark pulpit by some frosted pillar clings Among the serried aisles, doth stand and preach God's great perennial gospel to the poor; Or loftier strains, and settled nigh the helm, Doth float the nation into better times And broader schemes, and sunnier zones of Thought— Doth sweep the dead leaves from the path of Truth, And scoop a niche for Freedom and for Love In all degraded souls; doth point its eyes To track imperial Knowledge as she moves; And from the electric index of men's thoughts And widening opinions, learns the laws Of happy change; but chiefly looks above, And scans the white undying stars, and makes Its lightest motions twin to them,—for they If seen, are ever true. Thus amid praise Of all beside it and above, and awe Of those below, it walks: and women gaze Enrapt, or melt through reverence into love; And the hoar ancients of the people speak— ‘Behold, oh youths, and follow as ye may!’ THE CONFESSIONAL. How do we drone and shuffle languidly Thro' the dull round of blank unvaried days, Only some shallow self awake, to be Our pilot through life's common outward ways! The while, our truer selves, sleep-walking, crush The proffer'd bloom of sweet reproachful flowers, Or idly see, without a start or blush, Their glories waning with the waning hours. The fretful thoughts shoot up and die, or cowed By rude neglect and sloth, forget to be; And all the changeful wisdoms, that do crowd Life's passing periods, make them wings and flee. Each paltry act, each little scene, hath force To hold the total of our souls in thrall:— 'Tis crush'd at birth—'tis frozen at its source— The master-power to wield and scan them all. How should we sweep the broad expanse of life, Who listless lounge along the level strand, Nor, mounting o'er the billows and the strife, Watch the great waters widening from the land? Ah, fiends do drag our struggling spirits down Along the vulgar ways of vulgar men,— From our vext foreheads pluck the silver crown Of pensive thought, and whirl us on, as when They pass'd from Eden to the outer earth, Those felon-lovers: cringing to the yoke, We pant and writhe, and to the puny girth Of theirs, compress our spirits at a stroke. What skills it, that along the central deep Yon vivid maze of sheeted lights doth make A pleasance for itself,—doth fade in sleep 'Neath brooding clouds, and when they pass, awake? What boots it, that this tender blue is full Of most familiar stars—oh, all but kist For love, in nightly musings, when we cull And tend our spirits' darlings as we list? Yea—though all glories of the Earth be here, And we ensphered among them,—gazing far Upon chaotic loveliness most dear And grand of all the wondrous things that are?— We cannot read them—keen imperial minds Who live to the core of all things,—whose bright souls Are microcosms of all the many worlds Wherein they sojourn,—whose strong clench controls The slippery orb of thought, and grasps at once All vague impressions as they come,—who trace The netted veins of secret influence That blush through all,—may see them face to face; But how, for us, should this exuberant life Press from its swoln bulk the aromatic showers, Or these fair things translate themselves in full Into the rude raw speech of hearts like ours? ISOLA BELLA. Cool, delicious break i' the domed waters, Lying soft and still i' thy own green glory, Gazing calmly up at the kindred heavens,— Isola Bella! Once, th' enfolding waves, coming in from ocean, Brimm'd thy shelly marge with a wet and dazzling Glaze, and girt thee round with a zone of splendour, Isola Bella! Once, the level winds, full of love and quiet, Woo'd thy terraced lawns in a maze of eddies, Skimming fuller scents fro' the lazy flowers, Isola Bella! Once, between the grass and the rustling tree-tops Somewhere slid unseen fro' the cooing turtle Whisper'd lullabies of a drowsy sweetness, Isola Bella! Once, thy woods were laced wi' the briony-bunches, Thro' thick-matted ferns were the violets sending Tender breaths of love to the meadow'd cowslips, Isola Bella! Woodruffe too was there, and the elfin blue-bell; All the homely gems o' the earth were with thee, Over all the hush o' the cool grey morning, Isola Bella! Ah! no more the breadths of enamell'd waters Bathe thy winking sands; never now bright glimpses Fret their glossy grass i' the sloping woodlands, Isola Bella! Wanes the cushat's plaint in a vacant silence,— No new broods are born to the dying flowers,— Fades the fostering glow o' thy cloudness sunrise, Isola Bella! Oh, so stript and shorn, while an alien darkness Blots thy bare cold breast, and untimely autumns Cloud thy beauty,—what shall be done to ease thee, Isola Bella? Storms shall track the ebb o' the gurgling waters,— Every breeze absorb in a burst of thunder,— Choke the hollow coo o' the treacherous turtle,— Isola Bella! Ah, thy gentle soul never ask'd for vengeance! Nestling sere and lorn by thy wither'd Edens Thou wouldst fain forgive, and be sad for ever, Isola Bella! Therefore, all the years, or in cloud or sun-gleams, Sweet and certain charms shall be rife about thee, Build a new for thee and a holier spring-time, Isola Bella! Therefore, all calm hues shall abide within thee— Thou and perfect Peace shall have kiss'd each other 'Ere thy mellowing soul be dissolved in Heaven, Isola Bella! LIFE IN THE HEART. Sometimes, amid fierce roarings of the night, And driving windy gusts that blow and clash From morn to eve about a bitter day, The lull'd heart wakes, unconscious and alone, Mazed with cross-flashes from her dying dreams— And scared with fears, and horrors of the things Around—and with a shivering tremulous sense Of being more and other than them all; And hates, and doubts, and tosses to and fro, Feeling so strange—so little understood— So prison'd—so forlorn! And then her old Instinctive craving rises, and grows up To impulse, blindly snatching at the dark With fever'd hands, and gasps and cries out ‘Love— Oh Love—oh more than sister, mother, friend!’ ‘What means that strange wild burst of passionate want? Back, idiot—puling baby—this is Life! Life, the great battle of confused noise And dizzy strokes and thrusts—the clang and jar Of man with man—thou hast no place here: die!’ She strives to die: she rushes thro' the rout With stamp and scream and lunge, and woo's the din To thicken o'er her, hoping so to drown The gush of her own throbs, and kill all sense And consciousness of Being, and grow in time Insensate, or be smother'd in the moil— She dare not, cannot die: but, sweeping back Her scatter'd self, draws shuddering in, and like Lean, pucker'd kernels in the hazel-nut Mouldering unseen,—till some rude sudden force Shake them and hear the hollow rattling sound And guess the truth—shrinks shrivelling up around Her inmost centre, growing more distinct And sever'd from the fair bright face she wears: And stunted all and frost-nipt, when the whirl Of things apart from self hath pass'd away, Chattering with cold, and iced with freezing tears, Sits crouching by her secret hearth at night, And sighs and looks and saddens for the morn,— The tender morn—the rich unearthly morn— The holy morn—the morn that shall not be! THE BRIDE TO COME. A RHYME FOR HIM WHO NEEDS IT. O, stranger spirit—if indeed there live Aloof, some dear nor conscious part of me, Self-ripening till her virgin soul conceive The love yet uncreated, but to be— My peace be on thee wheresoe'er thou art,— Beneath grey roofs or under starry dome; My blessing on thy pure unshadow'd heart, And on the quiet portals of thy home! I know thee not; yet ever in my soul Some strange prophetic dearness eddies round A vacant centre, whirling to their goal Whate'er of love or hope in me is found: And some day, haply, in the march of life, That dark, unquicken'd void instinct shall be With sudden Being, and the ideal wife Warm into shape, and mould itself to thee. So cleanse and cherish I my heart, to make A worthy home for that expected morn When with the dawning orient as I wake Thy forward shadow o'er me shall be born; Or when, unbosom'd to the sun and thee, Thy potent presence strike an instant day On my train'd heart, whence sure and silently Comes out thy faithful transcript, fixt for aye. For self is not a full-orb'd whole: the range Of loves and hopes and joys are less divine Being single; but their embryo state shall change To fuller life, my sweetheart, blent with thine. So may my aimless words go forth and shoot Thee, lightly floating thro' thy girlish ways, To the heart's core; that thus with golden fruit Myself may reap them after many days! Set thou (and I have done the like in hope) My unknown face before thee in the way; A far and formless light, whereto the scope Of thy sweet life shall centre thro' the grey. Think on the darker stream, that lower down Shall half absorb thine own; so where it sleeps Sullen and thick, thy happier gush may drown In vivid clearness all its cloudy deeps: Live as thou wert the nucleus of a wife, Whom fair accretions, cloying from without, And from within, its own elastic life Enlarge, and swell the full perfections out. Thy soul is full of germs and seedling-shoots Not born for growth unaided, but to wind Their brilliant creeper-blooms and clinging fruits Thro' the dark foliage of a stronger mind: Yea, thou art but a germ—so, not untaught How all thou wilt be grows from what thou art, Let bard and sage inform with richer thought And set the wavering music of thy heart. So make thyself a woman—fair and vast Of soul, whose crown all Christian graces weave; Pure as the sainted maidens of the past, And grand and queenly as another Eve: With me, erect in clear intelligence, Most meet to tread the wondrous days that are; Spell out the secrets of the times, and thence Give help to woo the better Morn from far: A fair and graceful spouse, whose deep true eyes Make half my soul's imaginings of Heaven, A mother blest of the age unborn, that cries ‘She to our lives their holiest hues hath given!’— So, O twin lives that blindly move apart Yet not apart,—from wishes to belief Her wants have led the strange divining heart, And thro' her budding fancy peeps relief— Melt towards each other thro' the yielding years, Which, yielding, press you toward your mutual place; That we may know each other's smiles and tears, And how the soul doth fashion out the face. Come—and as viewless rustlings in the growth Of leaves above, faint earnests of the wind,— So let the nearing future thro' us both Thrill sweet foreknowledge of the bliss behind: Till, rising from the lover to the wife, Thy fairer self shall grow instinct with mine, And I shall share the secret of thy life, And light my inmost Being up with thine. THE BETROTHED. They say that thou shalt not for long Be free to list a nameless song— That thou hast ceased to be alone, And even now about thine own Dost knit another's heart: the strange, The wondrous-sweet, the eternal change Is coming o'er thee; soon or late Thou glidest toward the marriage-state. Henceforth, thro' special converse, he Brightens and softens into thee, And thou with fuller strength dost brim Thy soul, enlarging up to him. Two voices, thro' the long dear days To come, are mixt in one sweet maze Of sound: two lucid veins and clear Of twisted light begin from here And merge in heaven: two kindred stars Do weave and melt their fretted spars Of sheen above thy marriage-bed: Thy life is double—thou art wed! Ah queenliest of delights on earth, And rich with yet a deeper worth As promise of the years unborn— The years beyond thy bridal morn! Ah joys of spirit—thy partial soul, And his, concentring to a whole— Ah joys of sense—by Love refined, But saved: pledge of her human kind! For he doth clasp thee round, and thou Dost feel his breath upon thy brow, And feel his kisses warm thine eyes; The while he whispers lullabies Of tender dreams and thoughts of good: Then, with the cooling of the blood And nurture in the sober school Of life, your passion too shall cool,— But cool in clearest crystals, set For ever, like an amulet Upon the whiteness of thine arm, Fending from sorrow and from harm.— I too have known thee: known thee young, And blithe of heart and sweet of tongue; Have watch'd thee, fair among thy peers, Along the ever-brightening years Till now: I know thee what thou art— A woman with a woman's heart, A heart of love, a face of calm, And hallow'd, like a silent psalm. Therefore, O Lady,—whether thou Have lisp'd that sacramental vow That seals thee for a part of him, Or whether, thy dark eyelids dim With earnest tears, thou waitest till That bright melodious morn fulfil Thy soul with joy, and from its nest Unloose the circlet of thy breast,— I wish thee well: I would the year Of life, whose vernal carols clear Burst brilliant from thy marriage-bells, May lightly leave the frosted cells, With softest sunniest kisses woo And warm the crisp cold spars to dew, And drown the snows in happy showers Of myrtle and of orange-flowers, And lead thee thro' a ruddy prime Of summer, to the far-off time Of darkening floods and mellowing leaves: Ah, Lady, who but half believes That Autumn, for thy soul and his, Hath germs of fuller sympathies And richer love-blooms, ever new, In that fair Spring within the blue? And now, O tender one, no more To shred thy darling blossoms o'er Our paths, whene'er some wandering wind Hath touch'd thy heart or swept thy mind,— Who centrest all those winning wiles— That girlish growth of tears and smiles, And all that made our fixt eyes swim,— To one sweet kernel, all for him; Think not, when quite absorb'd within That warmer atmosphere, wherein True love doth burst her buds, and swells Into the perfect flower, and bells And fairy bugles shoot, and gem The smoothness of the central stem,— That the set smile, the courteous grace, The undying sunshine of the face, That make round Woman as she moves A motive neighbourhood of loves— That lit, as clear spring-dews the swathes Of juicy grass, thy maiden paths,— Is all of Man: chivalrous souls Do love the forms whereout there rolls A truth—that all things cold and stern Should melt and sweeten when they turn Toward Woman; but the rest? They hire Thrills of galvanic life to fire Their dead shrunk veins when she is by; And, wotting not the mystery And grace of her great womanhood, Starve her on sops and pulp, the food Of idiots,—till she haply learns To love the taste,—yet inly burns With hatred of the thing she loves:— Know thou, where'er the white moon moves She looks on some who dwell alone— Whose hearts not yet are chill'd to stone, Tho' Fashion with her gorgon-face Doth hound them up the breezy chace, And in the deep warm dells of life: They live, and woo the ideal wife. I see thy spirit through thine eyes— I read thee gentle, true, and wise; I hear thy heart's clear mellow chimes Above the riot of the times;— So haply, if, the while I pray For blessings on thy wedding-day, And crowd about thy future life The full fruition of a wife, Thou wilt forgive me if I dare To speak or sigh another prayer:— What time in love thou garnerest Thy tresses on thy husband's breast, Without a wish, or hope, or care, Beyond the arms that fold thee there,— That even then may sweetly rise Some wandering moonlight from thine eyes, And rest on others—yea, on me: That thro' our spirits silently A friendship calm and pure may move And holy, like a lesser love. [O sweet sad face, so ghastly dim] O sweet sad face, so ghastly dim, So pale, so much in love with tears,— Which makest all my brain to swim With memories of the former years— Which broodest like a pictured dome Above me ever as I move, And will not let my spirit roam From thee and mournfulness and love,— Pass not away: for these—the strife Of diverse sorrows in thine eyes,— The feeling of another's life Ravell'd in strangest sympathies About our own,—the stings of crime, The unburied ghosts of what we were Still wandering on abreast of Time, To keep our hearts from growing sere,— Are well; they make us grieve, and Grief Is Wisdom's mother in her pangs; And wisdom, strong in firm belief, Grinds to their gums the poison'd fangs Of old remorse, and leaves us calm; And sorrow, mellow'd thro' the past, Comes o'er us like a bitter balm, And grafts our sober'd spirits fast Upon the Tree of Life, and gives A holier purpose, that doth frame The after manhood of our lives To deeds more worthy of its name: And, tracking thy heart's woe or weal With shade or sunshine of my own, There comes a touch of joy, to feel Not wholly selfish nor alone. Pass not away: but oh, no more Be so unreal, so vague, so far— The mirage of a moonlit shore, The unsettled reflex of a star: Dawn on the range of Time and Space, Dawn clear and cloudless on my heart; And give me, of thy tender grace, To see and know thee where thou art. Thy place is empty by the hearth— Thy home is silent, lacking thee— Thy steps are elsewhere on the earth— Thy face remains behind with me. Sweet face! let happier thoughts begin To brighten thro' thee, which for me May bathe awhile in sleep the sin That was, and is, and is to be. VULCAN VICTORIOUS. Behold, he comes: a staid prosaic Life,— Manly, and grave, and grand,—but of most gaunt And icy presence—with a cold small eye Level and unperceiving, like a stream Of aimless light shot thro' the chinks—with grim And austere footsteps crunching as he moves The crisp starr'd frost-blooms from the unkiss'd snow Of morning—treading all unhappy flowers Into their shadows on the path: ah me! I feel his coming, and my heart begins To thicken with fat brawn, rank and obese, Impervious—or wrinkles shrivelling up For lack of moisture, like strain'd sodden pulp Of some discarded fruit, juicy and plump With yielding ripeness once, but now thrown by For ever—or it stiffens, whilst thin flakes Of callous bone freeze horribly along The surface, hardening inwards into one. Now Heaven be with thee, tender jewell'd thing, Shut in the fossil-rock for evermore!— But is there such a thing? Is there aught left To gasp a choking life i' the solid mass I grow to? O sweet nurse and cherisher Of young spring-nests in the dry leaves of eld,— Whether thou hearkenest at the name of Love— Whatever blessings between parted lips Fall at the mention of thine excellence— Who whisperest dreaming buds to wake and bloom Far out of season, somewhere in the snows— Who sprinklest the green shadows delicate Of moist angelic flowers endearingly On some soil'd coverlet—or dost prepare Love-wreaths to twine about the sacred cross Hallowing a grave:—May there not haply be 'Mid curdling juices and thick-clotted gums And clammy festering ooze, that seem at first To have soak'd the whole spirit up, to be in-wrought And kneaded with its essence utterly,— May there not still, thro' timid viewless veins Bursting at times, in scanty jets but pure As erst, be some dear remnant, keeping fresh The very kernel of its better self,— Some sweet poetic spirit, at the core? CLOUDLAND. Our walk through the progressive years Is as we rose along strange tiers Of telescopic stars, where lies A mist upon our upward eyes That shape and size and substance hides Of all; but being near, there glides A glory through them, and they grow And centre to a special glow Of light, and broaden and expand And look divinely fair and grand As high Selene: but when Time And we have reached a loftier clime, They darken downward dismally, And sink into a lower sky, And smoulder to our startled ken The rancid marsh-lights of the fen; And largest loveliest orbs and clear, Behind a lesser light, but near, Passing, grow dark in strange eclipse, Or suck'd between the inky lips Of darkness, die; the crowded light Of systems all but infinite Shrinks up into a single star— A little glimmer faint and far Upon the utmost verge of seeing; The wonders of expected Being, Risen to the keen meridian, glide Forgotten down the further side; Our stately planets, fair and full, August, immortal, beautiful, Shoot from their orbits and are gone; The gorgeous comets one by one That set the forward heaven ablaze, Die in a dull mephitic haze For ever: from her loftier land If, looking down, the growing mind Forget to spurn the things behind, From that deep dark a vivid hand Burns out, and writes upon the gloom In liquid lightnings this their doom— ‘Upharsin!’ [Thou wert a timid girl in those wild days—] Thou wert a timid girl in those wild days— ‘Too young to love!’ But now, whatever eyes Grow brighter in thy presence must behold A woman, full proportion'd into shape Luxuriant, and of soul no longer vague, But knit and sphered for life: Howbeit, to me Thou art a girl—yet no, a phantom pale, A memory growing sadder and more sere With deepening distance. Oh that something more Of thee than this were always near me! Yet I know not if I love thee—scarcely know If this be sorrow, or a subtle sense That gathers pleasure out of mournfulness, And decking with grave-garlands, kept from death By a forced rain of tears, its quiet bower, Doth dwell therein, drench'd in delicious grief! It may be—there is guile as deep as this Within us: yet I deem the traitorous heart Not utterly untrue—not quite so black To suck a sweet elixir from the dregs Of old misdoings,—make its very sin Bear fruit to fancy and send up a growth Of pleasant thoughts, in guise of penitence, For self-deceiving greed to batten on. O hard mistrust, and timid trembling tread E'en on the stoutest seemings! Can it be, Whatever bursts of bitterness at night Or earnest hearkenings for some step afar Upon the waste, are ours, that they are false? They are not false—I know it: therefore come, O far-off soul! I would thou mightest come And sit within the moonlight—so,—and I Would wholly doff the grandeur of the man, The strong supporting nature, as unfit And most abhorrent, then; I would be low Beside thee, wailing penetrative words Such as thy lot demanded and my heart Gave from its core; then would I look and see If any wandering ripples did disturb The smoothness of thy forehead,—if the course Of mellowing tears, that, like an unseen brook In the deep meadows, bless the yielding cheek With richer bloom, were moist upon thy face; Then waiting, watching, I might haply see Thy sorrow fading inwards, and behind Its dying darkness a clear lovely light Emerge into thine eyes, not all unmixt With tenderer glows and dewdrops of the dawn; Oh, that would bring a morning to my soul, A golden morning! Then my hand should go A seeking thine; and having found it, feel, In mad suspense, if any circlet wound About that mystic finger: if there were, I would arise and see thy face no more, Only in dreams and pictures, till I die: But if there were not— SELENE. She laid her down in peace to sleep, and soon She felt the vivid day-life dying down,— And sleep arose and prosper'd, and engulf'd Her as she gazed, absorbing from her spirit The knowledge of his coming: thought and sense Darken'd and sank within her; the firm frame Of her set mind was loosen'd, and dissolved Its special treasures one by one, as pearls In nectar'd wine, into the ambrosial soul: And indistinctness flicker'd,—and a mist Came o'er the rims of memories,—and all fancy Grew faint and vague and distant; and at length She pass'd the secret bounds of self, and slid Into unconsciousness. Then did all fair Sweet things and quaint make ready to immerge Themselves within her halcyon soul, and bid The land of sleep grow quick with shadowy life Ætherial; lighting up her quiet heart With moonlight of dear dreams: thus evermore Swathed in creative heavens of her own She lay and slept; and always as she slept The calm grey hours pass'd smoothly o'er her eyes, From midnight unto morning, till the dawn Had brighten'd out of twilight; then she woke. ICARUS; OR, THE WAXEN WINGS. Gazing far up into the expressive blue, Steeping my feverish soul enchantingly Under its keenest coolest deeps, there come Sweet prophecies that tell me of a dawn Of happy thought just brightening to emerge Within me. Oh, I knew it would be so; We are not brutes or senseless surfaces Of wind-rockt woods, to look on things like these Without a secret sympathy—a half Intelligent and half unconscious love, Absorbing, passionate, intense, and yet Craving to understand—importunate To know the meaning of its own delight— To read the deep mysterious loveliness With intellectual eyes, and not alone Reap joy, but strength and wisdom infinite By gazing; Therefore, O expected thought— Formless, profound, lying so dark and dumb Somewhere in these lone caverns, far below The bidding of the will, and only stirr'd Thence by some wayward impulse of thine own— Arise! Roll upward like the morning mist From sombre clefts and valleys of the mind Up the wet hills, and settle into shape Along the clear bold Alps of intellect! O half-created music, brighten out Upon the maker's soul, and frame thyself To some sweet symphony, whose clinging tides Eddy and whirl for fondness all about A little song of passion or of grief Half smother'd in the midst,—or some great psalm, Whose serried chords move royally, and crush All other voices of the echoing heart Into their own! O dewy water-drops, From this moist roof o' the heart drip stilly down Into the cavernous mind, and thence again Freeze beautifully upward, till you touch And prop your elder home—a crystal cool Stalactite, in whose calm transparency The filtering moonlight finds no flaw nor aught That came not from above! Thus do I seem To liken thee, O sweet interpreter Of what I see. Be not beyond my reach, As now, nor like fantastic shapes and quaint Of sedge and blossoming reed, in the dark heart Of running waters bedded, that dip down And rise again, and glimmer and grow dark, And flickering swerve thro' many an elfin guise To hide their own, till the strain'd aching sight Forgets to follow. O, slide perfectly Into the due constraint of human speech, That so in phrase of this dear mother-tongue I may embosom thee, and go to rest With the warm glow under my throbbing lids Of some delicious fancy—some new truth Cull'd to my little hoard from that immense And fallow Eden of uncropt delights And wisdoms infinite, where through all time Pastor and bard and sage their stalwart arms Immerse, and pluck rich fragrant armfulls home Unto their panting bosoms of wet leaves Luxuriant, and bold brilliant meadow-flowers And shy full-dropping tufts of vagrant corn— And shed them o'er the people in sweet showers Imperishable, startling back to them A breath of glory; while for such as me, Gazing full sadly betwixt closed bars, Some stray and seldom wind may chance to enrich Into a bloom of twinkling tints awhile The broad and dull savannah, or may blow Against the wicket-rails some sorry flowers For me to gather and be gone—in grief How soon some stronger spirit shall burst in, And revel at his ease. O envious thought! The food is garner'd, and the eater's lips Have tasted and are thankful: now who cares What reaper in the folds of his broad breast Did store it at the first? He hath small claim To be a Poet, who in the great field Thinks scorn to bear the burden of the day, And labour for his kind—who dares to pluck All day, and wreathe, pet flowers for his delight Like a fond child; nor searches evermore From that rich boundless prairie of his thought To grasp and harvest for his brother's heart The holiest and the loveliest and the best. Come then—come now! Or only let me feel The shadow of thy coming—feel that thou In the deep quiet shalt be born and make This dumb distracting pleasure grow serene And most intelligent, worthy the ken Of thinking man. For ofttimes the full flood Of passionate feeling, by whatever name It do approve itself to the searching sense Inquisitive of names, being drawn off, Encrusts the vapid hollow of the heart With rich rank lees,—opaque and scummy dregs Of what was lucid as the wet rose-hues Gushing thro' some high oriel, whose clear panes In light of eve are blazon'd to the full; Acrid and harsh of taste—the coarse remains Of an evanish'd flavour; and yet fraught In grosser substance with the very same Transparent spiritual thing, that sank And shed this slough in sinking. Such is verse— A range of lovely faces darkling out Of dwarfish mirrors—the scant aftermath Of some full crop new-mown from the ripe heart Into memorial-garners. Be thou born Within such sphere, O rising thought—slide out On this sweet stainless sluice to light: or float On weediest pools prosaic—only come! Hush! 'Twas some soft susurrus of those strange Close-curtain'd sounds, apart from hearing, which Do make a presence for themselves i' the heart At this still hour: and now there is no hope! That large ‘dumb swell’ of spirit, heaving up To burst in creamy floods of fresh clear foam, Brilliant, and speechful with a gradual stir Of small innumerous whispers seething out Of a wide undistinguish'd murmur—this Dies idly down upon the level sea; The level sea, but shuddering thro' itself Eternally, while in its secret heart Old dreamy deaths, and shapes whose better half Is clean oblivion, toss and plunge and die. And now, that blank bare passionless moon, and those Small shrinking stars, that should be something more Than a rime-frost upon the lawny blue, If we had eyes to read them,—that intense Exuberant blue itself, cradle and home Of all sweet iris-colours—viewless now And quite absorbed, but soon with touch of morn, Or inspirations of most witching eve, To blush into full vivid life—which now Is vacant utterly, disrobed and pure Of its own wild creations, like a soul Slid down thro' thought and feeling into calm More beautiful than either,—these delights, And all the weird mysterious earth, by gaze And neighbourhood of heaven grown spiritual, Soothed into feminine beauty more divine Than her strong sunborn splendours—these, and all Fair bournes beside, wherein scorch'd fever'd eyes Do rest at midnight, having quite benumb'd My spirit to a laxer gaze, grow faint, Uncertain, tremulous; and, cloak'd and cowl'd Like those lean Northern witches, silently Shut up their secrets and their loveliness, And with smart strain and shock, as of a growth Of little heart-strings breaking, pass away: And sleep and silence darken into me. THE EVE OF CHANGE. Still they are scatheless—lock'd in such a deep And central calm secure as might have seem'd Immortal: O, let no rude gust invade The latticed window, startling them to feel How very near is ruin! Still the old Dear ivy clasps the mullion—clusters still Up the green trellis, and against the panes Still droops and flickers in the sun: the flowers Not yet are orphan'd, which upon the sill Breast the cool air delighted, uttering Sweet thanks into the room. Beyond the broad Bright court, tall elm-trees of the avenue Slope out into the west; and over head, Out of the zenith-blue, a consciousness Of other hues is born,—uncertain things And faint, which do entreat all wary eyes To disbelieve them; but, more daring, soon Blush thro' each other—splendid phantasies Inextricably weaving of wild lights Rose-mellow'd into fusion,—which, behind Quaint antique gables dip transparently Into a rich unknown. What time the tides Of evening light are at the full, and swim A level flood through all enchanted homes That open to the west, they also here Sweep in, and slanting to a cool recess— Where student-lamps, and songs, and pleasant aids For leisure lie, not innocent of use,— Strike on a Belvidere—not instinct With Memnon's voice thereat, but glistening More bright and godlike—gazing from his nook At a coy Venus, whose wet shrinking limbs Hide in the shade: beneath them, in an arch, The eloquent Roman gathers up his gown, Intent to speak. That large delightful home Of unborn sounds, wherefrom, at whispering eve, All quick creative fingers lightly draw Rich births of intricate harmonies, confused, But most instinct with meaning,—this anear Stands like a sleeping human countenance, Suggestive—making in the inanimate room A sense of life. Around are many songs Of wordless bards, whose speechful music strikes Swifter and surer into all men's hearts Than poets' speech most musical: beside, Across the entering airs, the sofa lies— Immortal ‘Sofa’! where, with crude discourse Possess'd but earnest, friends have used to sit In gentle idlesse half a summer's night. Hard by, the central slab is thick with books Diverse, but which the true eclectic mind Knows how to group, and gather out of each Their frequent wisdoms: the great Book of God, Mother of blessings; and the thoughts of him, That one columnar ‘Columnar hills’—Reverberations. spirit, whose great soul Did antedate the larger growth of life For which we look—who moves among us yet, The Baptist of the future; lesser bards Lie round, and thinkers, whose melodious lips Yet glow with life; severe philosophies, Romances, legends of the grand old Greeks— What skills to speak of more? For in the midst, Shedding a snowy silence over all, Stands the white-throated bulbul of the North— Incarnate music: loveliest she in soul, And sweetest of the Syrens. Close beside, That nest of cushion'd ease, where musing Thought Oft sits at eve, and ponders with fix'd eyes The quiet embers; embers whence anon Some brilliant blaze, waking a kindred hope, Bursts on the startled room, as from the dark Springs a white wave against some sleeping shore. And o'er the shelving lintel of that hearth Behold a fretted wall, fretted with groups Of wreathen shafts and flowers, whereon sweet forms Of moulded grace are throned,—and hanging disks, Boss'd with wild scenes of that strange alchymist, And Margaret in his bosom. Also thou, Melpomene of saints! with buoyant wings And lucid robe and coronal of stars, Art domed in the midst. But chief above Leans the one pictured angel of the place,— Unutterable beauty: most austere And pensive is her silence—one faint shade Of sadness more, and she had been in tears; But O, how sweet! Her mute unfailing eyes Watch me for ever—they are on me now; And to absorb the fulness of their boons Asks but an upward look. She hath no heart That men may wound: and surely eyes like those Can drink a world of loves and sorrows in From him that gazes, and give back them all In blessings, like a god. What tho' she hath No being? Tho' no child of loveliness Call this sweet face her own? Sometimes 'tis well To love a thing that is not; so all wants That must be fed, feed harmless: and, i' faith, Our souls may well be joyous, holding up Betwixt themselves and that nonentity So fair a mask as this. Not all in skill, But wisdom too, Pygmalion was a god. Enough: I, leaning by the studious desk, Look on these things,—like him, the friend of God, What time he pondered from his eastern crag The loveliness of Sodom. Thus laments Vague expectation in the place of thought: “To-morrow, with the setting of the sun, This tent is struck for ever, and its spoils Flung through a ruthless future into death: To-morrow, with the darkening of yon blue And advent of the deathless moon, I gird My scatter'd self about me, and compress All love, all friendship, all remember'd sweets And vivid contrast of this excellence With that dull mist beyond—all gratitude, And all frail joys that cannot bear to leave Their home, but choose to stay behind and die,— Into that strain'd elastic word—Farewell!” ELD: A SCRAP OF LYRICS. What thinkest thou of the days of yore, Maiden, whose starlit eyes between The silken meshes of thy wandering curls Look upwards, like sweet dew-besprinkled flowers Deep in cool shadows of the long dark ferns? Is thine a backward-gazing heart, that yearns For the golden days, and the night of pearls, And the wonder-crested hours, That the men of other times have seen, Ere the Earth was old and hoar? She looked up through her waving hair With a gaze of earnest love To the pearly stars above, And she shook the curls from her bosom bare, And clasp'd her hands, and faintly said: “O, to have lived when the earth was young! When sorrow's plaintive harp was yet unstrung— When the sun sprang eagerly every morn From his nest i' the shadowy trees— And the wild unfathom'd seas Danced lightly round the blessed moon When she rose at night upon the verge Of the far-off surge, And her fleet smile—not sad as now, and lorn, But sweet as is the first dew-dropping kiss Of two young artless roses, newly wed, And making all the summer's noon One long caress— Went sliding smoothly o'er the onward waves, Waking a dimpled laugh upon the lip Of every rosy ripple on the deep, Or in the branching caves, Where shells, like flowers, in the waters dip, And wily mermaids sleep!” O then One circling smile lived on the sun's clear face; And all his glances bright Flow'd into one wide look of light: But as it glided down to earth, Merrily twinkling, The lovesome airs that near it had their birth Came dancing all around With ever-changing sound, And in their mazy madness clove The breadth descending from above,— Breaking the long continuous stream Of that full beam, And as a shatter'd mirror sprinkling The innumerous fragments—little wandering smiles— Like starry crystals fair, across all space: Over the mountains, and over the floods— Over the marshes and over the woods— Skimming abreast o' the coral-isles— Fringing all the bubbling billows— Peeping thro' the silver willows— Dotting as with beads of gold All the little lisping leaves In the dingle, on the wold— Steeping all the purple eves In shiny seas of honey'd light— Dropping tender ruby tips Of sheen upon the pouting lips Of every blossom, every shell, And every dancing flower-bell— Sowing tiny seedling-stars And diamond-tinted spangles On jutting frets and rugged angles Of all crystal cavern spars— Wreathing in bright festoons the gnarled rafters Under their trellis-roofs of forest-green— And oft with passing glitter scarcely seen Darting like meteors over liquid orbs And glowing bulbs of dew upon the feather'd sward, And in frail webs of linked laughters Weaving around the buoyant earth A playful network of fantastic mirth— Till jealous night absorbs All merry moods that erst more loving hours afford. I would be ever bathed in tears, And live a lonely nun for years, To kiss The faded earth again to that old loveliness; For it was then, when youngest Time Slept on the calm knees of Eternity, Uncursed with sorrow, unsear'd with crime, That keenest witchery Thrill'd thro' the glistening eye Of every baby-star That slept away The glaring day And from afar, When russet morn stole o'er the sober sky, More faintly twinkled, more feebly smiled, Like a drowsy child Deep in the down of her cradle of ether, Humming and droning a low sweet song— An airy lullaby, Half sound, half silence, herald of repose— Or, waked at evening, rose And threaded the deeps of infinity, With an angel above, and an angel beneath her, Guiding her heedless steps along The circled walks of the flowery sky; Or with her sisters play'd— Like winged glowworms fluttering through the shade In western isles— Hiding and seeking among the crowds Of the windy cluster'd clouds,— Stealthily peeping And timidly creeping Over the edges and out at the chinks, Or, with little wanton winks, Sparkling a moment in some deep clear break, That bares the blue profound— Like a sunny isle in a purple lake With misty mountains bound!’ FAREWELL. At midnight thro' the reverend courts I wander forth before I go; And in me the great stir of change Is moving blindly to and fro: And joys and blessings never more To meet in this calm nest again, And shadows such as haunt the rear Of happy periods on the wane; And thin transparent memories That thro' each other peep and gaze, Quickening the place with thought, and mists Of doubt, that hide the coming days, These, closing, clash with jar and whirl, Make a wild vortex of my soul— Drive the scared feelings up and down, Like splinters of a ruin'd whole: These, arching o'er my heart, as arch The leaves above a summer glade, Their webs of differing darkness weave, Till all my spirit is drown'd in shade. So, void and gloom are black within: Is there no solace in the time For such a sad farewell?—Above, The fair white hermit in her prime, Who smooths the shifting sward, and smiles Immortal calm thro' all she sees, Hath kiss'd a promise from the air To let her shadows rest in peace. Not mute her silence, nor unheard— “This is not all; for wheresoe'er Thou walk abroad into the night, I and my Eden still are there.” So it was weak to mourn; and life Is something more than death and change: Abiding presences are ours— Broad beauties, which no length of range Can keep from being o'er us: now! It is a thing of light and love, That distance takes not from the eyes That blue eternity above Which sets the scatter'd shreds of Time As starr'd mosaics, in one dome; Which makes, that spots of strangest earth Are sweeten'd with a touch of home. [O full of all delicious dews] O full of all delicious dews Of sorrow, born of shadow'd springs, Keeping the love-blooms in thy heart Fresh to their morning hues: O thro' whose life creeps many a grade Of darkness from thy central gloom, Making the light within thy face Only a lesser shade: O in whose eyes, thro' changeless years, The sweet sad waters, curtain'd in By drooping lids, unshed, unseen, Yet not the less are tears: I would thou didst not always dream— Like fair wing-folded angel, bathed Full bosom-deep in rosy clouds, Chanting a requiem— I would thou didst not dream for aye Thus on the threshold of my heart, Mute and impalpable and grave, Keeping all else away!... O no! I never wish'd thee hence: I close my blurr'd mimosa-leaves To any breath but thine: I pray, ‘O hush this wailing sense Of doubt, and from the lintel-tree Move wholly inwards, love, and there Abide for ever in the light That burns, awaiting thee!’ LINUS. Not unregarded drop the silver leaves Of hoary willows into the dark brooks; Moist pensive eyes are on them as they fall, Prophetic of the future: not unseen Sails the lone hern above her marshy mere, Far out into the darkness; many tears, And thoughts akin to tears, and mournful things That love the night, are with her as she goes: Nor all unheeded, in the wither'd copse, The last sere berry trickles thro' the sprays To earth; some cold forgotten bird looks on, And thrills another sorrow thro' its song: So not unmark'd we pass into the whirl Of life; all tender thoughts do wake and rise To weep and sing a dirge; but something else With brighter eyes looks on us from above. GLAUCUS. Thought is away—I will not try to think: I'll slide from sounding slopes of wakefulness, Down down unconscious to the sedgy marge Of sleep, where never one poor leaf shall thrill Its feeble circles o'er the sensitive smooth Blank of my spirit—not one weak memory Or whisper'd wandering remnant of a sound Ceased long ago, shall drone a doubtful life Thro' the utter silence: As young bathers plunge Their warm, impassion'd limbs intently down Full thro' the clear cold sluice, and, pressing up, Fresh lucid water lays awhile the bloom Of their soft faces, and upbursting round In cool still gush thro' their wet hair, above Gurgles and eddies bubbling to the top— The while with fix'd yet quivering eyes they dart Thro' waves of lazy light, slow ebbing far Into the deep opaque: so will I pierce Far thro' the shallow monarchy of waves And sifting tempests—whether of the world Or our own spirits—and sink, and sink, and soon Right in the stirless centre of all calm Faint into dreams: as sunken jewels, shook Between the chinks of labouring argosies, Glance down like shooting stars, and couch themselves In the white sockets of primæval bones,— All in the opal twilights and green glooms Of moonlike beauty, rich in native growths Of grandeur and memorial-wealth, that sleep There in the nether hollows of the sea. THE BRIDEGROOM'S SONG. Arise, O tender beauties of the morning,— Over the far blue hills arise and come! Fair eyelets, brighten thro' the dim cloud-curtains, And lead the faltering sunshine to our home! Awake, my bride, and leave the warm white pillows,— Arise, my love, my fair one—come away! There is no shade upon the quiet mountains— There is no thought of sorrow in the day: The joys to come have sent their bliss before them— The joys around we make our own at will; The joys departed, from still graves arising, Crowd to our hearts and make us happier still. Lie here and rest—O rest as if for ever Nothing but thou should be so near to me; And look not far, but look a little moment Out of my arms; and ask of all we see— Ask of the days when thro' impetuous kisses Young passion, wild and crude in every sign, Led us by windings sweet of close communion To something calmer, something more divine,— Ask of thy love—the love of thine espousals, That blush'd and blanch'd beneath the orange-flowers— Ask of all bliss that was indeed delicious, How more intense is this that now is ours! And ask of me, how many a grace unconscious Enfolds thee always like a saintly stole; Yea, ask of me if aught that is not lovely Can live within the compass of thy soul. THE VISIONARY. She is not here: but where all flowering rushes And broad marshmallows the cold sluice embalm, O'er her white feet the sobbing water gushes, And chills her into consciousness and calm. Let her alone: such bath will never hurt her; This is the place whereto she loves to come And sit and weep,—poor sorrowful deserter, For such a nook who wanders from her home! Unto his rest the red sun is departed— A brilliant brede is wrought of many dyes Upon the level gold, where all true-hearted And stainless spirits cleave with loving eyes; As ebbing breakers, when the tides are failing, Slide slowly down around a rocky spar, Bright foamy clouds into the far west paling, Lone in the clearness leave a central star. She heeds them not, nor how the hawthorn-hedges Unfold a richer odour to the May; Nor o'er the woods how many golden edges Of dark leaves flicker in the wake of day: She watches till from that forgotten quarter, Cloy'd with thick stars or lonely as the grave, A risen moon shall tremble on the water, Like new-lit sea-bird dancing on a wave: ‘There is the moon,’ she cries, ‘I love her dearly— Apostle sweet, to weary mariners That preaches peace: O, searching late and early, I find no other face so fair as hers!’ And if we go to comfort and to soothe her, Where, propp'd in reedy blooms, she doth abide Whispering and singing softlier and smoother Than flows the stirless current at her side,— She from her brow sweeps back the dripping curtain Of tangled hair, and lifting up her eyes Scans our near faces with sad looks uncertain, And thrills a little voice thro' many sighs— ‘Ah, there's no calm nor stillness in your breathing— Dark cloudy glooms about your forehead move— Hot thoughts and restless in your eyes are seething— Yours is no face that I could bear to love!’ Let her alone: so beautiful a folly Hath Reason's charm—yea, and her wisdom too: Better some loved ideal to cherish wholly, Than grasp a real love,—but not the true. BE WITH US. O Christ, be with us in the day of toil,— The weary day, the unrelenting hours, When we are choked and stunn'd in fetid rooms, Or flay'd in scorching suns, or drench'd in showers: Be with us when we leave the happy calm Wherein creative fancy is not bound, And thought reflective in the sober air No discord finds, no unpropitious sound; When some bleak knowledge, courted not for love, O'er the pale sunless spirit holdeth sway, And every mark whereby she is herself And not another, smoothens quite away,— The while there thickens round her and above A dusty cloud of trivial utterings, Hiding all law, coherence, grandeur,—all Relations and all principles of things: Be with us in the darkness of our grief— Darkness, wherein the starry light of tears Alone is ours,—where only some poor sighs Do make a lesser silence in our ears: Be with us in the howlings of despair— The day of famine, when the children's cries Are thronging up to heaven, and sweet life Ebbs mutely in the mother's fading eyes: Amen! and chiefly when impetuous sin Throbs sudden thro' all pulses of the soul, Be near, O Lord, and nerve us then to prove The strong fierce joy of struggling self-control. THE SEXES. O, you are fair—you have soft turtle-eyes, Not flush'd with vulgar passion, clouded not With stains of folly,—whose transparent lymph No shadows dull, no fretful eddies blot: Your souls are precious oratories, closed And curtain'd in from all things not divine; Where smoothest sounds enrich the loving air, And moons alone and silver cressets shine. You dwell in peace among your pleasant hours— You hear no echoes from the far-off strife; You lift your shining eyes, and all the place Feels happier—feels the magic of your life. But we—for us in the thick thronging days No shrine, no bower, no oasis appears; No path is left whereby we might have climb'd Back for a moment to the better years: We have forgotten all—we hear not now Our mothers' teachings,—see not in the land Its ancient beauties,—look on you as dreams Too fair to love, too high to understand: We are uncover'd—the rank, stagnant air Infects our breath—our curdled souls endure A press of crawling horrors—and vile sounds Hiss in our dull ears: how can we be pure? RUS IN URBE. Cool, shadow'd water-deeps, Where by the glassy sweeps Flowers in fragrant heaps Cluster and hive: Where, like a glancing shark, Thro' the rich lucid dark Oft doth some sunny spark Shudder and dive: And the thick-braided coil Of fretful hues that boil In the red west, and foil Thy searching gaze: And the black war of storms— Grandeurs and flashing forms, Born when the quick cloud warms Into a blaze: And the keen-edged moons Sprinkling their starry boons Over the dark lagoons, Over the trees: And the still silence, fraught Only with peace, where nought Comes 'twixt the soul and thought:— Lovest thou these? Lovest thou these, O man Who since thy days began Ever wast used to scan Nature apart;— Whom in the very core Of her ripe joys she bore, And hath for evermore Nourish'd thy heart? Yea, if thou givest heed Duly her face to read, Then is its light indeed Dotingly dear; But thou art haply cloy'd With the sweets long enjoy'd,— Careless hast grown and void, Callous and sere. Lovest thou these, O heart Which in the stirring mart, Circled with things of art, Dwellest from birth? Yea, thou mayst sigh and think How it were bliss to drink With thy scorch'd eyes a blink Of the cool earth; But with no lagging beat Ever thy busy feet Press the hot whirling street— This is thy home. Thou, then, by some strong law Plunged in the city's maw, Whom from thy woods I saw Mourning to come; Lovest thou these? The strange World of thine alter'd range, Leaves it without a change Nature beneath? Yea—the old love doth flood Ever thy vivid blood,— Purer than maidenhood, Stronger than death! PATIENCE. Be not so fierce and ardent in thy love, Nor strain and batter at the pitiless doors That shut thee from thy future; nor remove Thy restless tent from the low quiet shores Of resolute endurance: they have spells To work fair wonders in their own good time. What if thou hear not always her sweet bells, Nor catch the silver trueness of their chime? Know that she loves thee also in her sleep: She lies in her calm breathing, and the while Strong thoughts of thee full often from the deep Of her meek heart blush out into a smile. Therefore have patience, like to her: go dip Thy soul in healthful darkness for a space: Soon comes the morn—and thou with thirsty lip Shalt drain the early sweetness of her face. THE CITY OF GOD. Who art thou, jostling thro' the dreary crowd Of stern lean-visaged men, and from thy youth Perceiving in the wealthy and the proud No thought of brotherhood, no touch of ruth? Who art thou, with the bare unshelter'd head, With the glued lips, and sinews tense, and strong Brave heart but sad, that for thy daily bread 'Mid the swart gnomes of labour wrestlest long? Who art thou, that, with purpose to be whole, Tramplest thy partial natures down, and bidst The unseemly scaffolds round about thy soul Collapse, and leave thee settled in the midst? Yea, who, that strivest sorrowest unto death,— Not wholly bound for interest or for love Unto the things that are, but underneath Intent to gaze beyond them and above? There is a city set upon an hill— There is a somewhere that is more than home— There is a source where thou shalt drink thy fill— Approach: the Spirit and the Bride say, Come! FLOWERS. Do you wonder we are not degraded? That some light yet flickers in our souls— Some stray heaven is left upon our faces? We are fond of flowers. How could folk help sinking in the squalor, Growing callous to the loathsome things All around them, if they did not always Scent their hearts with flowers? Could we keep from being discontented, When we catch across the dingy roofs Little glints of something blue beyond them, If we had no flowers? Could we keep from hating our existence, Hating more this else unsweeten'd toil— Keep from curses foul, and wild blasphemings, If we loved not flowers? Hark! he calls us—‘Pay me what thou owest!’ Oh, have patience—we will pay thee all But a moment—surely you can never Rob us of our flowers! Take the scanty store that still is left us— Strip and spoil until the wan room lies Cold and bare and cheerless as our spirits— Only leave the flowers! [If I should see thee where perhaps in peace] If I should see thee where perhaps in peace Thou dwellest, sooth'd in sweetest shade beneath The cool wide brim o' the eaves—shouldst light on thee In far-off spots, whereof I never learnt Their secret ties and linked lovelinesses, And that associative mystery Divine, that shows them beautiful indeed, And makes that none, whose life is not inwove And blent with theirs, shall read them to the full;— In silent places, where no influence, Impress, or thought, is redolent of thee— Where not a voice in all the murmurous air Tells of thy presence;—if I should discern Thee thro' the home of strangers, and amid Its busy range of household cares and dues, Moving at ease, with queenly looks, that tell Thou art no stranger there;—if I should watch Unseen the yearning of thine alter'd eyes Toward another's face,—should see thee press With arms of love to thy white juicy orbs A babe that is not mine,—of whose pure soul Thou gavest the better half, but some one else Than I did build it up into a whole: If I should see thee thus, with unaware And misty eyes— A SURPRISE. If ever in the range of sudden joys, That at rare moments, when we never thought They were anear, do snatch us from ourselves Into a keener life, thro' that acute And half-delirious clearness uttering A burst of bliss more exquisite, to die Full soon into remembrance—there be aught Most penetrative, most intense, of rank Peerless, divine; it is when some young bard From secret dusk beholding where she sits In the deep-bosom'd rich recess, a fair And pensive girl, whose fixt absorbing eyes From a wide volume drink its beauties up And make them purer,—having fed awhile Upon her face—creeps stealthily near, and bends Expectant from above,—and she, with scared And changeful cheek, looks mutely up at him, But looks not long, for blushes and for tears:— Behold, the thoughts she loveth are his own! TRUTH. Arise and shine, serenest star! for we,— Like as the bridegroom joyeth o'er the bride, Like as the mother claspeth to her side Her firstling babe,—do take delight in thee: Delight, because thine advent is not far, Nor dimm'd thy face behind these misty wraiths; Delight, tho' all the clashing bitter faiths Marshal their set battalions for the war. 'Tis but the war of each peculiar soul— Thro' ravell'd doctrines to think out a creed That shall be pure and catholic indeed, Nor warp nor crush the great symmetric whole Our God did give. The skies are and the brine Vext with grey gloom, and dark with thundrous blue; And fitful stripes of rainy light imbrue The shivering earth: sweet star, arise and shine! CONVENT THOUGHTS. SUGGESTED BY A PRE-RAPHAELITE PICTURE. No—nothing more—forgive me if there be, Sweet Mary-mother! but I do believe There is no remnant left of what I was, Nor any coward corner of my being But feels the biting caustic gnaw and burn And blister out its black obdurate stains Of self unmortified; Oh, I have grown The bride of Christ indeed! Why have I not Squeezed out and crush'd the scanty dribbling dregs Of feminine nature that were yet unwrung, And plunged in poison every yearning impulse, And wholly drown'd the woman in the saint? Have I been timid? Have I spared to drive Right thro' the cankrous centre of my heart Full many a hissing iron, that should kill That venom'd core of feeling utterly? Have I not choked the foul, unchasten'd will— Lash'd with due stripes the elemental sin Out of my wincing body, and tamed down With hungry fastings oft the rank and gross Unsanctified luxuriance of my flesh In the bad days of girlhood,—and am clothed With holy leanness like a child of God? Do I not murder every wish and thought That stirs beyond these walls, and quite abjure And—and—yes, hate the presage horrible That tells me such are coming? Do I not Unwearied scour the circle of my soul Lest any leavings of the world be there,— And with delirious fury persecute And hound thro' nook and crevice as they fly Those wilful obstinate memories of home, And things more dear, that used, O fatal sin! To lie like mists upon my breviary,— Till they are—almost—dead?.... It must be right; 'Tis not for women who are rich in faith, Zealous in love, baptized with special grace To follow Him along the path of Life,— 'Tis not for them to thread the lowly track That Nature marks, to let the—Kyrie! What means this quiver?—let the name of Love Be whisper'd in their ears, nor waste their smiles Upon a husband's face—their prayers profane Over a household's welfare; nor descend To soil the exquisite tissue of their lives With common occupations: how should she, Who should aye touch her beaded orisons To listening saints, imbrue herself for ever In loathsome coil of coarse domestic dues Most alien to a woman, and consent, Making a duty of a hideous sin, To gird herself with children as a curse, And all forsake the excellent reward Of isolated virtue, to make one Of those weak hearts who stoop to be the bridge That links the generations? or how choose To think them aught but false, who feign to see E'en from her cradle the unveiling years Mapp'd out for work and action in the world,— Who prate of use, and purpose, and an end,— And talk how she is queen of all that's fair, And should with tide unfailing and sincere Set the pure current of her influence Thro' human hearts,—and should be full of nerve, And quiet modest strength, to labour on Beside the hearth, and in her several sphere Teach the great things to flourish, or the small; A mission'd spirit, having it at heart Not less than man, to beautify and bless And move to higher paths her native age.— Oh, errors false and damnable! yet once— But I have pruned those vagrant sympathies As our good mother bade—“This is thy home; Leave the blind age to swelter in its pools Of reeking sin, and drift—and drift”—alas, I must believe it!—“hopelessly to Hell.” Oh, that some voice of penitence and prayer Might reach those doom'd ones! That from every side And sloping surface of the domed earth, Perplex'd with clotted sweets—which, if I dared Skim from its breast the leprous crust of sin That once I saw not, I should call most fair— That hence all forms of Woman, all that looks Thro' feminine eyes and wears the sex of Eve, Were banded up in one great sisterhood Of pure and resolute virgins; then indeed The human world would be divine! But hush! Saints are not human; their refined and rare And immaterial natures are buoy'd up From touch defiling of the vulgar soil, And rais'd to meditative height supreme Above the herd of sinners. And they say I am in steady growth to be a saint: Yet have I felt as if our woman's heart Did need a something human, on the which To lean, and prop your panting bosom up, And bare yourself to the core, awakening Thro' that close pressure dear responsive throbs Born of your own—a something more than these Creations evanescent of the brain, And far abstractions of a differing world, That do support us here. But, O forgive— I have long striven and battled with the thought,— Jesu-Maria, save me! Yes, 'tis well; I think I'm happy—penance does me good: And Father Simon is a holy man: And contemplation is a blessed thing: And not a maiden ever loved her God But school'd herself as I do, to the quick:— Yes, I am—very—happy. Is it long This method takes to make one ripe for Heaven? FAITH AND FANCY. Once, the Muse was most punctilious On poetic etiquette— ‘Vulgar’ scenes and phrases never Could her jealous wrath forget: Dainty Muse! She with fierce laughter Curl'd her Grecian lip in scorn— ‘Leave thy place beside the fountain— Themes like these must not be borne! What, shall Fancy's depths, so lucid, With such starry pureness rife, Clouded be with turbid gushes From the foulest wells of life?’ So she spawn'd her cheap ideals— Left the warm and wedded hearth— Would not learn the large and loving Language of our mother-earth; Told us that the heart of Nature Yearns but o'er an idle few— Throned the selfish fond Stylites On his pinnacle anew:— Well might such be blind and erring When she spake of things above; Well beyond the marriage-music Fear to lead her songs of Love!— She hath suffer'd, and repented— She is chasten'd, and revives Truer to herself, and claiming Larger kindred with men's lives; Yet she is not better'd wholly,— Impulses of other days Warp the feeble, and the stronger Wind thro' strange unfruitful ways: For her child, the Poet, idly Lulls him in an airy nest Throned amid some gorgeous cloudland In the ‘palpitating’ west; There, with strange and formless fancies Reeling thro' his heart and brain, Twines gay chaplets for the angels To a wild enamour'd strain,— Woo's the countless stars their secrets In his little breast to hoard, Crowding it with twinkling glories As the dewdrops crowd the sward; And, thro' tiny crevice peeping, Takes a comprehensive view Of the Home of the Eternal— Of the Heavens beyond the blue! Scantly, in the Christian Bible, Are her flowers to Fancy given; Solemn clouds, mysterious grandeurs, Dimly veil the Christian Heaven; But the daring bard hath revell'd On the wings of spirit-cars,— He hath mated with the angels— He hath couch'd among the stars;— He hath grasp'd a brighter Gospel— Won for Earth a richer boon— Sunn'd the twilight of the Bible To a clear enchanting noon! Blessed bard! But shall he never Hear these voices at his door— Voices of the great wise-hearted, Voices of the meek and poor— ‘Give us back the ancient dimness— Once again the mists of morn And the trusting faith of childhood In our weary souls be born! ‘Who art thou, a fellow-pilgrim Faring to the self-same shrine, That our hopes should wane and sicken In the garish glow of thine? ‘'Tis the glory of the twilight, 'Tis the blessedness of eve, That no envious lights estrange us From the visions we believe; ‘Sorrow with her heart in heaven— Love that blossoms on the Earth— Young imaginative Manhood— Prophets of a soberer birth— ‘Humble souls whom Fancy never Lured beyond the life they knew— Each doth shape his proper heaven: Who shall say he shapes not true? ‘Cease then, nor thy labour'd landscape Trace with freedoms half profane; Vain the brilliant baths of colour, All the meaning touches vain: ‘Dearer that suggestive outline Faint, but with unerring rod, Sketch'd upon the haze of morning By the wisdom of our God.’ EGERIA. O mine Immortal, my sweet nourisher, Thro' whose transparent beauties I discern Thy spirit in the midst, a tender Psyche Bedded in richest amber,—upon whom I look and am at peace,—whose influence At times doth make it less than truth to say ‘Thine eyes are full of morning, and they break Thro' dewy lids as breaks the blessed morn Between her cradle-clouds:’ but otherwhiles Leads my near lips to whisper unto thine, ‘Surely no more such plenteousness of tears Thy soul should drink; O let the rainbow-light Shine in thine eyes, that cometh after rain!’— Lo, we have loved each other with a love Abiding, boundless, ever since the time When first thou walkedst lovelily among The daughters of thy people, and the winds— The very winds—that made themselves a home In this rich wilderness of curls, or peep'd Under these lids, did tell that thou wert fair: And we have trod together many paths, Luxuriant some, some barren,—leading all Into the moveless mist, but not without A glimpse of blue above; have minister'd To contrasts sharp and strange—now tremblingly Held the vain mirror to the lips of death, Now train'd their bridal-flowers thro' the hair Of laughing girls; nor ever did our steps Swerve from their close instinctive harmony Of tread, nor ceased affectionate touch to feel In lengthen'd claspings of each other's hands Content, nor I refrain'd to steep my soul In thine infectious beauty, whom to know Is to become as thou art. Tell me, then— We, who have wander'd on luxuriously Breast-deep in all bewilder'd ravishments Of this fair world, and bubbling momently To effervescence of delirious joy With every rarer and more pungent draught Of bliss—whose aye-fermenting hearts leapt up At the bare name of Beauty—who have loved The pure Hellenic face of Poesy, And loved her most because we seem'd to hear In her full voice the hoarse low utterances And pregnant silence of the human heart Translated into music—who have clasp'd Nude Nature deep in our enamour'd arms, And kiss'd her to the quick—who strove to pierce The arcana of intelligent delights, And half intoxicate the expanding mind With speculations wild, and theories Whose rapturous madness darkens for a time The truth of God, and fond mysterious hopes That lie all night upon the ground to hear The far-off footsteps of the time to come: We who have drain'd the nectarous vases deep Proffer'd of all true spirits which do tend A joy, from lowliest wood-nymph to the Nine— Have trod the fresh and teeming vats of life, Kneading with foam-dipt feet the rosy cream Seething from half-crusht bulbs, whose bursting juice Spirted delight o'er all our glowing limbs,— Yea till the inspiring fluid pass'd, and we Stood soak'd and cloy'd knee-deep in sodden lees:— Say, in all wildest gushes, all unstemm'd And most elastic pleasures, did we not— O love, we did! perceive in our full hearts Bloated with fierce or flush'd with calmer bliss A hollow gurgling deep below the deeps, Whereto they did not come? It might not be: The stormy rush of largest avalanche That ever startled on his far-off crag Some fleeting chamois, could not drown the whole; Could not instil itself thro' all, nor worm Its white cool beauties thro' each fibrous vein Of the o'ermaster'd spirit. They were vain— They could not, these things, in the 'mid spring-tide And torrent of their passionate influence, dive To flood the depth of our capacities, And whirl and scoop around the fathomless roots Of our dread Being; could not rise above, And swell themselves to the gauge of our untamed Titanic aspirations; nor with strong Impulsive jets, transcendently supreme Of height, bedew the distant azure dome Roofing our templed spirits; nor fulfil With perfect food our inborn consciousness Of what is beautiful and what divine. O hear! There be who struggle to the end, And mourn, and bleed, because they will not grasp The truth that would have saved them, and have changed The burden of life's dirge: An if thou seek To hold communion with the things of peace— To be sincere and whole, and have delights That leave no nook of Being unexplored,— Rest not in things created, nor in minds: Be not afraid—strike home—and let thy soul Pierce thro' the Godlike inward unto God. THE SEA. It was not much I ask'd of thee, O Sea! Only to let me see thee as thou art, And gather in as jewels to my heart The fulness of thy beauty and thy power: Couldst thou not grant it for one little hour? Thou art too grand and catholic, Too quick With delicate life and tender influence rare, For our rude partial souls to reach and share: We are like eyeballs nurtured in deep night, That shrink and quiver, drown'd in sudden light. So half the beauties of our earth The dearth Of timely grasp within us doth allow To pass unseen; or they with cruel brow, When our strain'd eyes are toward them in deep love, Frown us away, and far out of our ken remove. COMFORT. Thou wakest in the darkness, O poor soul, Even in thy sleep,—and moanest with the moan Of doves beside their windows, when they grieve To be alone: I know thee that thou mournest—I perceive Thou art in sorrow, even unto death; My heart doth hear thy great and bitter cry, And wondereth. “Depart, O stranger! I am full of tears— The music ceaseth from my stricken hand; How shall I sing my sweet memorial-song In a strange land? “How shall I walk these cloister'd corridors, Chilling my naked feet against the stone? Let me alone, that I may die in peace— Let me alone!” O thou afflicted, which art far from rest, Toss'd with strong storms, and comforted in vain, Doest thou well to gather to thy heart So much of pain? Thee doth the land of shadows evermore Possess? Nor one victorious minister Snatch from the deep black waters of the proud? Dost thou not err? Lift up thine eyes, and look unto the hills, Whence all sweet airs flow down upon the sea; And hearken thither for a voice that sings ‘Come unto me!’ “It is enough—I will arise and go: Blessed be thou that spakest such a word, Rocking thyself upon the wavy thorn, Most loving bird! “Blessed be He that all before the time Thrones our fleet hearts within the far-off bourne, And breatheth balsams on the throbbing eyes Of them that mourn!” PSYCHE AND HER TRIALS. Die, strong delusion! die, foul hooded fiends, From secret rents whose livid jaws protrude Their fangs of blood to gnaw us into fury! Will you not die? Nor help us at the least To foist a thin belief upon our hearts, Making awhile fair seemings to be dead? Tush, we are fools to speak it: they but prove Their nature in the attack—and we, alas! Keep ours in yielding. Ay, and if their arms Shrank at full clutch to stiffness—if their rank And poisonous breath did suddenly vacate The unexpectant air, and leave it free— His were an idiotic birth indeed, And such whereon no passing flakes might stick Of common wisdom, who would stake his soul On calms like this, and trust for total death To such a trance, and imp his airy wings For stedfast voyage upward thro' the clouds, On such faint promise of a coming breeze: Yet such are we, who willingly to-day Die in the floods that only did not drown Yestre'en. I know not what your sermons mean, You with smooth stagnant spirits, where no trace Of wrong can come but which is sluiced away In one short prayer—who dwell among your days In passionless impenetrable peace, Or well distinguish in your inner strifes The marshall'd foes, and fleetly, nor in vain, Help the sweet Heaven against invading Hell: You have no knowledge, men—you never probed The awful depths of Being further in Than your own shallows; you translate to us The Book of God with small peculiar eyes, And from the sample of your puny selves Make bold to teach us what we are, and how We may emerge to better! Come and see: Oh, we will drive you thro' imprison'd deeps And wonderful in horror—thro' black dens Where one's feet crunch among the gory lairs Blancht heaps of purposed excellence destroy'd,— Thro' whirlpools where the restless raving surge Dashes its wrecks into forgetfulness And dizzy dim confusion—thro' a scene Where all the diverse complicated Man Is rent and torn and shiver'd utterly To countless fragments, full of frightful hate And strife against each other, knowing not Each other nor themselves, and only sure Of that dread doom which makes their cup of frenzy Foam o'er the brim—that they must unto death Writhe on, and bleed, and wrestle, without hope Of peace, or hope that any stronger part Shall crush the rest to silence; and all this— This huge wild chaos—evermore immured Within one essence,—essence that at times Is lost to itself, and shatter'd to the core With partial shocks unceasing: oh, my soul, This, this, is agony! Then will we gloat With rabid looks upon you when aroused To spasms of terror, with clench'd fists and wide Expanding eyeballs—then we will unfold Our knitted features to a bitter grin, And shriek into your tingling ears that this Is human life!..... O brothers, have you heard Of One who all the workings of such storm Watcheth, not heedless, and being sought, hath power To blench the lightnings with his eye, and speak The uncontrolled thunders into peace? THE PREACHER. Hast thou considered thy soul, And all that is therein— The throes that shake the unsettled whole, The sorrow and the sin? Gigantic mysteries are rife, And fairy wonders small— But unto thee thy proper life Is stranger than them all. So many natures intermix— Such diverse threads are spun— That none avail to fuse and fix Its elements to one: Such doubts distract, such strifes deform, And toward some unknown bourne Such longings lead it thro' the storm, And leave it there to mourn! And yet it is a tender thing, And often o'er the leas Will stoop and hearken on the wing To him that speaks of peace: And yet it is a thing of faith, And willeth to believe; A noble thing to cope with scathe, To struggle, and to grieve: And yet it is a kindly thing, And often in the tent Of gay Gitana joys doth sing Its spirit to content: And yet it hath a royal mind, And strength of nerve and eye To hail new knowledge on the wind, And grasp it, and apply: And yet it is a thing of love, And yearning as a bride; And plaineth like an errant dove That hath not where to hide. O, yes—the soul is large and deep; There are lone alleys there, Where always Hope may walk, nor weep, Nor faint into despair: For echoes somewhere in the woods Shall carol back to her; And in the granite cliffs their floods Of future waters stir. Therefore, put strength into thy heart, And leave the stranded shore; The Christ that makes thee what thou art Shall mould thee into more. HOUSEHOLD TEACHINGS. This is the place, and this the month and hour, But all beside is little else than new: Who shall the unseen hollows of the air Fill up, and to its vacant niche restore Each native life and due accustom'd face With welcomes of delight? Oh, it is true That not their proper influence alone, Or beauty, binds us to the things we see,— But chiefly, if some sweet peculiar voice Flow from them unto us; so places, blank With barren silence to the souls of some, Are populous to others with all dense And varied forms of vision and of sound; So not with briny unadhesive track Our swift existence moves—but everywhere, At halts and pauses, leaveth of itself Some portion unawares, the which, again By chance returning thitherward, shall speak Reproach or triumph to the alter'd soul; So not for me alone, nor all for thee, The worth and dearness of a place abides, But every heart that passeth by that way To death, with separate shadows of his own Shall store it for the time; poor tenantry, That flee or perish when their lord departs, Yet, failing, keep aye ready to revive What time he comes again. But as for these— This idle room—this foolish garniture And mere convenience of our common life— These are unscath'd, nor fiery breath of ill Hath pass'd on them; they, stedfast and secure, And heedless to all comings and farewells Of such as hold them dear, do still abide: While we, the lords and slaves of circumstance, Thro' varied action move and brisk event Unfather'd of the Past, nor care to turn And face the tracks of change—and on our heads Strong stormy gusts of unseen providence And full bewildering cataracts of harm Burst booming from above; and (but to tread One step beyond the timid walks of Thought, And force our mute self-stifling consciousness To speak) full soon the lean and clammy worm Feeds on our dusty blood, and obscene maws On rotting shreds of what we hold for self Do gorge themselves in peace: aye, thou dost well, Gaunt ban-dog, spitting thro' thy slimy fangs Bits of the brain that helps me now to thought! Yet, O strong man of heart—O clear-eyed youth— O virgin fair—O precious wife serene— Shall we then yield all true stability Without a blow, and dwindling into death Gnash at the vain and lazy permanence Of creatures such as these?—Nay but, O man, If thou art man indeed, and wieldest well The birthright of the soul—to generate Immortal life, even at the stroke of doom—, Thou shalt defy the unconscious rivalry Of stabler things inanimate, and rise Like a fair city builded of To-day With energies and wealth,—whose massy feet Hide their deep prints with deeper as they grow; Whose deeds eclipse the thin decrepit fame, Long undeserved, which old historic mouths Rain still upon the languid scanty sward Of modern dulness withering on the place Where heroes bloom'd; whose firm majestic march Chills the weak blood and wrinkles up with spleen The cold hard eyes of snarling burghers—men Who howl to see Pretension spoil'd, and see The tatter'd poltroon back before a thrust Of honest effort brave,—who bid us weep, As if the great Past in most swift decline Or full prostration of her bastard brood Did sympathise and suffer! So shalt thou, Holding sweet useful commerce with thy kind,— Commerce of thought, whereof thou shalt dispense No selfish largess,—commerce of good deeds That bind thee to thy fellows,—opening out Thy powers of life, and seeking most of all To atone thy spirit with the mind of Him— So 'mid decaying follies thy wise soul Shall build a proper immortality, That shall outlast the stony senseless front Of temples made with hands, and fructify With many a grateful memory among The children of thy people; and shalt learn How better than the vain eternity That means but lack of death,—how more in tune With Nature's music and the laws of God, It is, to tread with no unheeding feet Nor witless eyes nor profitless dull soul, The fruitful paths of due progressive change. AUTUMN. The harvest is past and the summer is ending, And the glooms that betoken the tempest appear; And fast from their lairs the marauders are wending That harass and prey on the desolate year: Nor less, in the heart, is her loveliness perish'd And her hopes are in tears at the voice of the storm; Nor less, of the toys that her folly hath cherish'd, The sorrow disheartens, the evils deform. There is corn yet untouch'd on the slopes of the highlands— The warm woods are green in their nests by the hill— There are flowers and ferns on the bright little islands— For the autumn of Nature is beautiful still: But who shall break open our weed-ridden fallows, And who shall restore us our excellence whole? And where is the chrysom that cleanses and hallows The stains that ferment in the breast of the soul? Ah well for the hearts that have ever been fair, and Have cool'd into forms that owe nothing to sin— With scarcely a speck in the mellow transparent To tell that contagion has trespass'd within! OUR FATHER. Thou sayest, that the night is dark, And that the wolves are near,— That loathly taunts and malisons Wax hot within thine ear; That in the thickets of thy heart They die for lack of food Or stiffen 'neath the serpent's eyes— Thy callow broods of good; That massy darkness groups the sky, And in the frowning west The fierce sun dies a bloody death:— But who can tell the rest? Who, in the unsuspecting gloom What pleasant gourds have grown, What starry seeds of future light Are in thy furrows sown?— Thou sayest, that He will not hear; That thro' thy weary wards There is no voice, nor stir, nor sign, Nor any that regards. Yet what if Hope be tranced or die? Her very corpse is sweet— Thou shalt embalm it in thy tears And lay it at His feet; And ere they put it in the grave Once more I bid thee pray: Pray with no errant voice unblest, But as thou know'st the Way; Pray with the voice of dying things That agonize to live; And He shall hear thee from his Throne, And when he hears, forgive. DEATH. Animula vagula blandula..... Quæ nunc abibis in loca? Marcus Aurelius. Thou diest as the elders died— As we are dying now; The sister with the brother's kiss Yet moist upon her brow— The father with his stalwart sons— The bridegroom with the bride— The true meek wife with that frail thing That throbs beneath her side— The mother with her little child, Her dear, her only one— The lover in the lover's arms— The pale recluse, alone. Like these thou diest—many friends, Some far unrisen day, Shall come and look upon thy place,— But thou shalt be away: Like these thou diest, and like all: Then wherefore do I care To trouble with vain thoughts of thee The dull regardless air? Why vex again the wearied words That minister to woe, Or shed the precious balms of song For such a common blow? Because the ancient marvel still Is wondrous in our eyes,— Thy single Being, tense and warm, Chills into twain, and dies; They cleave and part, thyself and thou, And one, the bright and brave, Becomes a memory and a ghost, And one is in the grave: Because no spirit of the earth,— For all the dusky wings That grate across his heart and sweep Shrill sorrow from the strings, And tho' to us the starkest corpse A sleeping beauty seems, And steep'd is all its slumbrous state In the rich dew of dreams— Hath yet avail'd to speak or solve The mystery of Death; Or lessen to our grasp of thought The secret of our breath,— The ‘daily miracle’ of Life, And whence its workings wend; The mystery of mysteries— The Purpose, and the End. THE BITTER LESSON. Hear, O thou Shepherd of the people's souls— Hear, O true angels, if when not as gods But as most needful ministers and helps To lead us upward, it be well to link Your lesser names with His—hear, O serene Good influences, curiously inwrought Into the complex world, whether in kind Ye manly be and chivalrous and strong, Or, being feminine, are soft and pure And beautiful in weakness—hear and save! For unto us some sudden strange eclipse Hath blotted the clear heavens, and all stars Forget to comfort, which we knew before. What! in the very inmost neighbourhood And chiefest intercourse of things most fair,— At such a time when Nature in the blaze Of Art's adorning triumphs as a queen,— When nightly splendours, not of moon or star Crown her white brow harmoniously and aid Her native orbs to shine,—when the full scene And the odorous airs with fertile breath do rear Out of our sleek serenity of soul Quick blossomings of delight, and the wide zone Of spirit that lies along the edge of sense Is fed with sunshine—gorged with brilliancies Of motive light, and bashful colours rare, All intermellowing, as the peasant's cheek Feels her rich blushes melting thro' the bronze,— And crowded touches, swift, innumerous, Of elegant lithe forms, which pass not by Without stray showers of lispings undertoned Shed on our sweeten'd ears,—and cataracts And daring bursts of music large and clear, Bubbling cool shocks thro' our chill'd quivering hearts Like waters of the morning,—fed with these; Nor this alone, but the inner sensitive core Of intimate Being finds its proper food, And choosing some more calm delicious face Moves with her thro' the music and the throng Link'd in no profitless companionship, But, crunching bravely the ineffectual briars Of sere convention, treads itself a smooth Walk of intelligent converse, and aspires On tiptoe towards her, grasping eagerly The ripe o'erhanging fruitage of her soul:— O love, O purity, O high delights Of our high nature! Was it not most foul, Moving from joys and benefits like these, To light on comrades crown'd with the new crown Of manhood like as we—vaunting themselves True knights of courtesy and of gentillesse,— In whose unworthy arms linger'd e'en yet The warmth and throbbing of a circled heart And that a woman's,—to see men like these Stagger upon the threshold, soak'd in sin Which e'en the meanest reasonable boor Beholds with scorn; to see them all unrobe Their traitorous selves of that high atmosphere Serene, to plunge and sputter greedily down Thro' rank and oily mists and fiery breaths, Likest themselves; and, having so befoul'd The face of Beauty, from their loathly lips With words of evil, blasphemous, obscene, Wipe out the memory of all pure discourse,— And thus—for whoso ravishes the one Leaves not the other stainless—thus defile Her sister Holiness: O that men knew What very twins they are! Then did I set My rigid teeth, and muse in sore amaze If this were but the native brutishness Of single few intruders, whose disgrace Suggests no secret law of ill, or if 'Twere not indeed the damnable result Of erring rules; of intercourse forbid, Or warp'd and check'd, with Woman; of the flow Of our twin vials kept studiously apart, Whose happy union wise would effervesce In brilliant blessings over the parch'd world, But which, alone or mixt with awkward skill, Grow flat, stale, rancid—doing each his best To infect the innocent air and make it meet For fiendish throats to breathe in. Hear and judge, O men of thought—and for the love of Heaven Act on your true convictions! How I joy'd To feel immaculate and hold those men In hate and scorn,—till vile discoveries Throng'd into me like ghosts, and throve and spread The virulent degradation till my soul Bow'd from her upright posture, and I grew To loathe the sense of life and thro' white lips To think and murmur “O strong agony And bitter bitter ruin of all hopes That told us we were gods, and that the world, And all her broods, was excellent and fair!” Yea, it was true: we are Promethean gods, Warm-blooded, full of large humanities, And loving kindness as the law of life; And to our souls the very noblest Heaven Approves itself a mother; but below, How are we spoil'd and centaur'd utterly To something less than Man! Nor this alone, But that small ceaseless devil at the core Thrills fierce distress thro' all the brutish half, And up into the godlike. O that thus The secret of our nature should ooze out,— That in soft glossy shadows of the hills The loathsome ore should lie, and with rude lumps Break the smooth current of sequester'd streams, And streak with odious veins the hoar serene Of most majestic mountains! O that thus Out of the damps that sicken at its base All toothless chuckling hags should soar at will Up to the crowning peaks o' the soul, and there Encamp at ease—lean mothers of despair! Hush—thou hast heard that never out of thee Thy stains depart, nor shalt thou wholly snatch The precious from the vile, nor skim the tares From off the whitening billows of the corn, Until the harvest. Let the harvest come! ELEGIACS. Why is thy heart so sad, O sensitive child of the morning? Why do thy lone eyes gaze timidly over the sea? Why with a circlet of tears are the rims of thine eyelids enamell'd, Why with an exquisite ear, quivering nostril of dread, Standest thou thus as a roe or a hart on the mountains of Bether, Searching the pregnant wind, proving the echoes afar? Do I not well to be sad? and is it not meet to bewail me, Seeing the day is come—seeing the spoilers are here? Have I not dwelt i' the stars, and have walk'd with the lovely immortals, Learnt from the hallows of night secrets of beauty and love? Have they not told me their hearts and pour'd out their beings before me, Taught me the lore of gods—taught me the language of Heaven? Yea, I have steep'd my limbs in juices of myrrh and of almonds— Plunged my exulting feet deep in the sluices of spring,— Yea, I have buried my heart in showers of blossoming roses— Fed in the lilies alone—slept on the breasts of the flowers; Yea, I am filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the evening,— Yea, I am ravish'd with bliss—drunk with the beauties of thought! How then shall I come down, come down from my nest in the cedars, Into the swarming world, into the Babel of sin? How shall I leave thee for aye, who hast lain as a bride in my bosom,— Fancy and all her brood—how shall I bid thee remove? Why do the archers appear and plunder my substance before me— Tenderest ewes with young—tenderest lambs of the fold? Why have they taken away my own little lodge in the desert? Why may I bathe no more in the still waters of peace? O that mine eyes were tears, and my head were a fountain of sorrows! Then would I wail as a dove—mourn as a turtle alone; Mourn that my jewels are dim, and the crown of my glory is fallen,— Mourn that the odour of dreams passeth for ever away! Brother, thou doest not well—thy voice is the voice of a fledgling, Under his mother's wings lying awake i' the nest: Him doth his prison of leaves and the shreds of far azure between them Hide from the larger world, hide from the sight of himself. Lo, we have gather'd a spar, and have treasured it up for a diamond— Grasp'd but a part of thought—seen but the shadow of life; Why should we stroll any more by the whispering shores of the ocean? Why should we only emerge out of our own little eyes? Not to a single soul doth the Universe open her wonders— Not in the self-same speech tells she her marvels to all: Shall we not list then abroad for all other innumerous voices Teaching us what are her looks, what is her language to them? Come to the men of the world—to the men of unknown occupations, Strange in their every pursuit, alien of nature to us; Ask them their thoughts, and stand like a sentinel-spirit around them, Watching their soul in act, watching its workings within: So shalt thou be as a man who adown some new glade of the forest Sudden beholds once more scenes he had studied of old; Had he not grasp'd them at large, and translated their uttermost meanings? See, at the voice of change, beauties unthought-of appear! So shall the elastic soul expand; and the young understanding Learn new phases of truth, new revelations of life; So shall all vanity cease, and the knowledge that maketh us humble Pour in astounding floods over the shallows of self; Errors that lay as a dream in the brain of the sick and afflicted— Sympathies narrow and low, mists on the eyelids of Love— All that was childish and vague—shall the royal reformer abolish,— Catholic thoughts shall reign—Wisdom shall triumph alone! Turn thee again to thy rest then—the waters shall not overflow thee; Out of the floods arise—flee as a bird to the hill! Thou art no wanderer always—the slippery ways of the darkness Vex not thy feet for long; 'tis but the passage to light— 'Tis but the hanging ravine that leads from thy gorgeous old highlands Into the land of streams, into the plains of the south: There shalt thou pasture at ease, and the comforting sons of the angels Soon with the voice of a psalm gather thee into the fold. Turn thee again to thy rest—for excellence is not departed: Not with the dreams of youth dieth the glory of life; Beauty is large as the world, and pure in the depths of the city Sits the creative soul, fashioning splendours at will; Large is the wardrobe of Peace, and Joy like a vivid chameleon Aye to the wise in heart changeth from better to best: So, whether manhood allow that our life shall be wedded to Nature's, Or from the passionate eyes snatches their darling away, Warm in the light of Heaven and the inner stars of enjoyment We shall abide and work, hearty and healthy and hale; And from the calm of the morn, from the beautiful blush of the Orient, Rise in our might, and stand firm in the raging of noon. THE MOURNING MOTHER. It was the time when the passage-birds Come to us over the sea; When the stiff roots moisten in the quick earth, And the sap thaws in the tree; When out of the core of all living things A lovelier self doth rise, Like the smiles that come up from her fathomless heart Into a woman's eyes.— She saw the thick dews come back again To their homes in the bell-flowers, While she sat by the lattice like a queen Among the fragrant hours. She was not alone, but silently She circled her slender arm Over the heart of a little child That nestled in her barm: And aye when that little child awoke 'Twixt the old dreams and the new, He smiled the full and meaning smile That only dumb things do. 'Twas half like the glow of his mother's face Shed on him from above; But underneath another light And other memories move. ‘O little child—O happy child— My own and not my own! Does every mother love her babe But for itself alone? ‘Across the still prophetic face, And in the eyen clear, She sees the steps of his father's soul— She sees, and holds him dear. ‘It is her truelove's child that feeds At her sweet breast alway: Lo, this is why they love, and why I cannot love as they. ‘I fondle him, for he is my own,— But his warm limbs never knew That closest press o' the heart, that tells He is another's too. ‘O mute remembrancer of grief, Forgive that these things be; The man that should have been thy sire He hath no part in thee!’ HOLY EYES. Keep thine eyes calm, my little one, my dove! The deeps above Will not for aye all fretful colours drown Within their own: Keep thine eyes cool, my love, as melon-juice Or the deep sluice; Full oft shall they be heated into tears In the far years: Keep thine eyes pure, my darling, as a slice O' the polar ice; Soon the bad winds shall bead them with a rime Of loathliest slime: Keep thine eyes clear, my sweet, as the bright rim Of waves at brim; Nor let them deaden with the common dues That matrons use: Keep thine eyes loving, dearest, if thou'dst be A heaven to me; O my one lake of love, let no shade quiver On thee, for ever! WHICH? I. Refrain thy voice from weeping, and keep thine eyes from tears— There are fair crystals bedded deep within the central years: Descend, and bind the little star of Hope upon thy brow, And clench with manly gripe the tools that lie beside thee now; Dig down into the solid gloom, till somewhere at the core Thou smite the carbon to a blaze, and of its jewell'd store Shell out the yearning light that throbs within each secret gem, And string the shining bosses up into a diadem. II. O yield thine eyes to weeping, and steep thy heart in tears— It is not far, the voice that makes a tingling in thine ears Of doubt and dread, of want and woe, of sickness and of death: Smother thy foolish songs, and nurse the fragrance of thy breath To lift and buoy such mournful things as load the autumn airs— The scatter'd wealth of sighs, the weight of unavailing prayers: Yea, hearken what the rushes wail along the sobbing mere— ‘Thou art a stranger on the earth, as all thy fathers were!’ MISERERE. Turn us again, O God of our salvation, And bid once more these thirsty spirits and prone Suck the full fragrant breasts of Consolation, Where as she sitteth fast beside the Throne! Turn us again, O strong divine upholder Of the pure soul that doth not yet depart; Deep in the everlasting arms enfold her, And warm the chill blood quicker to her heart. Turn us again—the brave young stars are sinking,— A lustier health the foil'd endeavours crave; Nor Fancy's flight nor the strong mind's deep thinking Can keep our fair Immortals from the grave. Therefore our hearts are sad—and therefore only Seek help from thence, where the calm Futures be; Nor seek in vain—how were we weak or lonely, O God of comfort, being stay'd on Thee? THE PROGRESS OF POETRY. Hurrah! at length the ancient lie is dead— The bloated blear'd bombastic bigotry Of soul, that swept inflated Genius up Like a thin bubble dancing in hot air Fantastic measures to the varied breaths Of praise and humour gushing from below; That prison'd in a cage of woven flowers— Sacred to self and faint with labour'd scents Of musk and almond, cassia, and of rose— The unresisting Bard, alas! himself Nor blind nor innocent; and like a ghost Stood up between him and his proper aims. “He is a god, the Poet—he was born To wanton at his will, and glorify In song the frail conventions of his age, And float sweet transformation o'er the face Of worthless themes, caressing without care His vain imaginings, and making glad All pleasant follies with the shadows warm And flashes of his momentary wings. 'Tis his to speak of Nature unto us— Nature, not horrid and unkempt in wild Barbaric lawlessness, but sleek and smooth And train'd to regular beauty like the neat Trim gardens of the Tudors: how divine His purling streamlets and his verdant meads! How bright the lacquer'd lustre of his woods! How rich his varnish'd sunsets—and how fair The oil'd effulgence of his summer seas!— Yes, she is lovely, Nature, when we know, Creation's Lords, to wield our high behest And teach her how to bloom. ‘And it is his To haunt the cedar'd chambers of the great,— To suck nutritious moisture from the skirts Of their long robes, and cool his joyous lips Among the happy dust wherein they tread: Ah, well he knows the birthright of the Muse— He leads her deftly thro' congenial paths That she was born to move in;—is it not Her truest home, to roost beneath the wings Of some great Patron, huddling soft and warm In that high nest, nor need to taste again Degrading commerce with the men of toil, Their vulgar sympathies, their clownish ways,— But hymn with odes and heartfelt heartfelt lays Of adoration and deep gratitude The man that made her famous? And 'tis he Who paints with truth the manners of the age; When courtly damsels, sick of routs awhile, Long for the cooler legends of the fields, 'Tis he who sketches with familiar hand The peasant life of England,—gathering up In ruddy groups the people as they are With all their simple feelings and pure loves; Smoothing alone whate'er unseemly crust Their rustic speech may wear. He bids us learn How tender Strephon in the northern dales Follows his sheep at morn, in modest garb Of Arcady, and moans a lovesick soul Unto his lute thro' all the languid day; How Phillis, loveliest born of rural maids, Lithe-limb'd and slender, rich with native grace, Moves with white fingers stainless all and pure Among the household toils, or wanders forth With crook in hand, to tell to the kind grove Of cruel Damon's harsh delays, and all The moist abundance of her tender woes. Still, still, I hear the soft pathetic tale! How should we learn the customs of the poor Without a bard like him? And chiefly his, Delightful task! to chronicle and mark For praise, the precious doings of the fair: Who knows not this the grand imperial aim Of Poesy—to celebrate and sing Not Woman, but the fair? Haply the eye Of sportive Lust may melt its fever'd light On some poor maid, whereon impulsively Her humble life is lifted into song; But 'tis the nobler woman,—moulded out By Art and Fashion, rich enchantingly In most angelic falsities and cheats, And wean'd and widow'd from heart-fellowship With man, that she may perfect her sweet soul Untainted and in peace,—'tis only her Whose scented bosom the melodious winds Seek to for ever, savouring themselves Therein with odours: her, whose charms afford, And all the varied outline of her life, Full many a shelter to the drifting Muse From God and Nature; her, whose soft intrigues, Whose luscious languid loveliness of form, Whose gait, whose mien, whose vapid speech, and all Her round of fruitless ways, and every gem Of grace and splendour that exalts her state, Are rich materials for the soaring bard, To make his verse divine. Oh, how he joys To crouch beside the arras, in that warm Luxurious chamber where the secret gnomes Of Art are moulding Celia for the ball! How gleams weird inspiration in his eyes The while profusest ministering aids— Patches, rich unguents, scents, cosmetics rare, Thick lustrous oils, exotic washes, wreaths Not of coarse Nature's flowers, convolving groups Of sympathetic ribbons, kerchiefs too— Transparent films of gossamer, that prove Celia no mortal,—while such charms as these Ferment and fuse about the anxious fair Till from the chaos of her changing self New worlds of beauty rise!—Who would not strive To set such noble story to the voice Of fair Harmonia's daughters, when they sang By smooth Cephisus in the silent noons? A theme! a theme! Her practised orbs are closed, And ducal Chloe sinks into the grave! See, Tomkins wakes the lyre—See, pensive Jones Floods the swoln gullet of a raptured age With elegiacs.—Once again, behold The sire of song, impassion'd Hymen, comes! Tomkins, arise! With classic touch dispel The Christian manners of a modern muse— Forget the Church, forget the solemn words And meek responses of the man and wife— Let the white-cinctured pastor be to thee A priest of Venus—and, for those still aisles And sombre groined arches of the Past, Raze them, O Tomkins! Let the plaster'd frieze, The stunted column and the thin volute,— Poor shivering exiles, beautiful and just In that far country and that native time, Doing forced service to a foreign faith Here in a foreign land,—let fanes like these, Their smoke, their victims, deck thy nuptial lay. Thou too, great Jones, for thousand ears prepare The terse trim sonnet and vivacious ode! Doth not Miranda in fair deshabille Dance the fat babies on her joyous knee? Doth not e'en now full many a sprouting tooth Blanch young Alonzo's gums?—Behold, 'tis thine To mould a glowing casket of rich thoughts For Delia's brooch; and hover on starr'd wings Of delicate fancy round Olivia's fan; With eager grasp to gather as they fall The precious shreds of her luxuriant hair, And make them famous: thine the blessed task To canonize canaries, drone the dirge Of sainted pet-lambs, and lament in song O'er truant monkeys and departed dogs; Weaving as thus, perchance, the cypress-leaves— ‘From crystal fountains where thy sisters use To hide their charms at eve, immortal Muse! Descend, and teach my labouring soul to sing The worth and beauties of the lapdog Spring!’” So rang the chorus, in that vanish'd age, Of worshippers; such foul defiling jets Of inspiration and bad influence Drench'd every lesser bard, nor spared to stain The garments of the greater. After this There came a day of change, a transit time, When the weak Muse with steps of gradual health Moved thro' an eastern gorge but thick with mists Of morn, and all beset with serried rain. Then rose that royal spirit, in whom a crowd Of untamed natures strove for mastery, Each like a god's: of whose large soul the gloom And tempest was more beautiful to men Than clearest noon of others'. Like a cloud He hung in the mid vast, too high to trust Men's little measurement of things divine, Or feed his yearnings with the scant beliefs That sate their easy souls: but right above The shadow of the solid throne of God Fell on him—so his grand erratic soul Sway'd through thick darkness, while the light of Heaven Sloped off to fall diffusely on meek eyes Far down from his: Poised thus upon the wing Proudly alone, his hot and pitiless Imagination, as with tongues of fire, Lick'd his scorch'd frame to madness: also he, As with a morbid relish of fierce pain, Hugged his great tortures, and upon the keen Excruciating barb of his own thoughts Impaled himself; nor this as hermits might, In silence,—but invoked all heaven and earth To hear him howl, and bared his agonies And writhings to a sympathetic world. Wildly, and deaf to wisdom, he explored The mountainous creations of his mind Without a guide, till o'er the sheeny edge Of some ice-chasm whose chill transparent blue Grows dusk and thickens down the awful slope To unimagin'd night, he slipp'd and fell Into the dread Unknown; but left behind His voice—a beacon and a monument Of aimless grandeur, and how terrible Is that great tyranny of Intellect Apart from God, and how unclean a thing And pitiful is Genius with her eyes Soak'd in foul scums of an unholy life. Strange mournful man, who floated like a dark Gigantic moon athwart the sun of truth, Eclipsing half his age! Whose majesty Of spirit, and those melodious utterings Of rank inhuman hate, and bitter boasts Of loneliness, and moans of coward grief And weak unmanly whinings of despair, Made selfishness divine, and brotherhood And loving help among the human souls A thing forgotten, or a word of scorn. Then did each vilest imitative worm Writhe in its slough with envy, and in hope Wrought long to burst its puny chrysalis A Psyche fair as he: and those unripe And brainsick younglings, o'er whose yielding souls The lauded crown'd Apollo of the time Rides royally and crushes out of them All free and vigorous manhood—all but prone Blind rivalry and homage,—such as these, Who felt a twitch of hunger at their hearts For fame, or winced with sorrow or neglect, Went out into the wilderness,—like him Forsooth! to snarl and gibber at their kind And belch the reeking torrent of their woes Into the lap of Nature. Like as when Above the silver bosom of the Nile, Feather'd with ripples, in the porous rocks Those sainted idlers swarm'd,—so also now Men blubber'd to the chafed impatient sea, And bay'd their sorrows to the scared white moon, And bellow'd in the affronted woods, and pierced With sentimental shrieks the indignant ears Of a fair helpless world. Was it not foul To clutch the broad unstinted loveliness Of Nature thus for little ends of self,— To insult the peaceful Immortalities Of earth and heaven, cheating them aside Each from her proper work, wherein they stand, Most Catholic impartial ministers, To comfort every sorrowful sweet soul Still true to love, and solace and arouse To joy the weary workers, and to woo All human spirits upward—yea, beyond These delicate tissues of created charms Into the world of spirits? As if the vast Imperial sea, and this warm vigorous earth, And those serenest meditative stars, Would stoop and falter from their high behests Of love, to cloy with special sympathies And close regards the weak fainthearted groans And moody murmurs of ungrateful man! That age is past: and, speaking thus, behold I am no graceless son, who in the reek Of drunken folly leads his beardless friends Down the old pictured corridor, to mock The faces of his fathers: Is she not Most precious, Truth? And may not every soul Who burns to see unclean Convention gripe The stalwart arms of gods,—who dares believe (Seeing what nearest neighbours unto heaven Were those great Nine) in queened Poetry— Her sacred sovereign mission on the earth— Her heritage in every soul of man— Her portion in the morning stars—her due To own no wild caprice of self, but rule, Like faithful satraps on their utmost thrones The staunch vicegerent of a central King;— Who trusts in this, may smile in his true heart, And turn with waxing fondness and delight His lunar eyes from the fair mother's face Upon the fairer daughter, while she grows To stand in awe of her great self, and learns The method and the manners of a queen. For now no more the cold yet cringing Muse— Full of rank scorn for all below, and prompt To spout her slimy scents on those above— Faints her base life in heated rooms of art A colourless exotic, nor abides In cells apart from the unimproving Earth An isolated saint, nor walks abroad Hooded and muffled, with such diadems And coils of jewels round about her ears That not an odour from the common soil Nor whisper'd wail of miserable things May reach her—and all thick with listed shoon, Lest unawares in some black pulpy mass Of human bodies steaming in a slough Of unregarded wretchedness and sin She tread, or use her high prerogative, Sowing with fertile foot the thankful waste With islets of young flowers. Brother men! She is our sister, and our sovereign she: Behold her how she travels even now Out of those errors, girding up herself To seek again her old melodious home And birthplace in the everlasting hills; How thro' low cots and hamlets of the poor She ministering moves, and in her clear And eloquent voice rings out to common men The truths unthought and folded mysteries That live in common things; or, having scaled Her native heights, on slopes and cloudy crags, The curtain'd doors of Heaven, holds intercourse With a most present Father; and anon, Her lucid features melting through the mist, Scans with cleansed eye the wide subjected world, And reads the rolls of Nature, and unweaves The ravell'd voices of the time, and reads The thoughts of nations, and maps out in song The thousand lives and doings of her kind. BETHESDA. Get thee a thing to love, thou man of sin That prowlest thro' the sweet unfearful earth In act of crime: Feelest thou not within The squatted ghoul, that hatches into birth Thy frequent broods of evil? Stifle her— Whirl up the reeking nest and that foul dam Into due death together! A strong stir Of heaven-born winds, if thou but say ‘I am Astray—O help!’ shall do it; shall denude Thy spirit of its selfishness, and wake That drooping dull and listless lassitude To matin freshness, for Another's sake. Get thee whereon to lean—eternities Of blessed hope, for which our spirits yearn, And a meek resting-place for thy sear'd eyes In this world: such a pillow thou shalt earn Wooing as man should woo; thy throbbing head Half sunk between the tender yielding globes Of her warm breasts shall lie, replenished With odours; he that cradles there disrobes His muffled soul, and sleeps unveil'd and pure Of secrecy, within that nest of peace. Get thee a soul to doat on—'tis the cure For vagrant follies and the sins of ease: Gather great store of fuel unto thee,— Red burning blocks of Passion, under which Bury thy cold black heart, and let them be Profuse above and cleave into a rich Clear mass that with intensest lucid heat Throbs to the core. Then, while thou wonderest At such a flame, the viewless Paraclete Shows thee thy heart all molten in the midst, Or charr'd to snowy softness. Yea, my friend, This is the furnace that shall purify Thy nature into nobler: here shall end The struggles of thy youth. O, when thine eye Seeks first the love of God, not far behind With airier step the glad affections move And fuller pulse; while softly thro' the wind Comes the fresh fragrant breath of Human Love. THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS. Last winter, on the New Year's Eve, When thro' the silent lips of Night A cry as of a quickening babe Shot thro' our waiting hearts, and white Among the ruins of her throne Sat Conscience, while the sad and true Recorder of a dying year Gave up her tablets to the new,— Hope had not died—a ruddy burst Show'd sometimes that she still was there; Nor yet had frozen into life The black assurance of Despair. Twelve martial months, deform'd and dead, Lie heap'd against the doors of Time Since then: they thunder'd like a band Of rash assailants in their prime Of heart, against the bastion'd walls Where Knowledge lies and Peace; but lo! Those walls are smiling huge and calm Above a crush'd dishonour'd foe. Yet thou, Siberian year, whose team Of reckless days begin to move And whirl us o'er the frozen steppes More far from boyhood and from love,— Proceed—these ice-drops are not tears, But chill'd effusions of the air; Proceed—this exile shall not jar One murmur thro' the voice of Prayer, If o'er the pillow of our dreams We see the slope that angels trod— See the link'd bars of cloudy pearl Dissolving upwards into God. NEW YEAR'S EVE. Mute, mute as death! There comes no messenger— No shy low-lisping herald—no uncouth Intrusive Sybil—no clear sudden change And vivid contrast, such as breaks of hue To wanderers floating from the blue Moselle Into the differing waters of the Rhine— There comes not aught, to teach the unthinking hours How soon, how swift, they in another sphere Are plunging,—where the breath of alter'd Time Pants to new measures, and all works and ways Of life move awkward, clothed with novel names, And all the annual crowd of purposes And hopes and high responsibilities Are wrench'd from this, festoon'd and gather'd up To a new centre. Yet, tho' the dumb moon And all still births of yon star-nourishing blue Are clear above—things which do keep alive The sense of silence in a noisy earth, And tho' the utmost frontiers of the time Exhausted are of sound,—the ringing heart Takes so awry the impress of Repose, So scantly grasps the thought of Rest, so far Is exiled from the calm Eternity, That this serenest vacant lull to her Is populous with motion, and she deems The virgin void of Night was only hush'd To bring the tramp of years more close anigh Her fever'd expectation, and to make The snorting of the wayward teams of Change More palpable and clear. Alas, that men Will scoop the petty periods of this Life Out of their native dust, and take them up Within their mouths like pearls of eloquence, And roll them thro' their solemn lips as tho' They were great oracles and words of power Most meet to be an heritage for us, The sons of the Eternal! O, 'tis false: Hours, years, days, moments—they are but as chains That prison like a fair Andromeda The struggling naked soul, and bind her fast Betwixt the stedfast bald obdurate rocks And a vext surge, for ever. How unlike THEE, which hast brought us thro' another year Down the smooth paths of pleasantness and peace— Our Father and our God! In that crude age Of nameless hours, when first the suckling Time, Shaken from the breast of great Eternity, Totter'd alone,—when silent centuries Stole trackless o'er the molten bubbling earth, And skimm'd the ruddy surge a ‘cooling crust’ That hiss'd with vapours horrible,—Thou ART; And now i' this dubious hour, that swerves and sways Betwixt the battling currents of two years,— Thou ART; and in the far grey formless dawn Beyond the hills,—that grey which is to us Only the utmost bandage and the rind Which, being unwrapt, shall strip and sweetly bare In turn the deepening colours of the morn— A nest of hyacinths—till 'mid her own Transparent hueless glow the Future stands Awful in beauty,—not the less Thou ART: But we ?! Thou heard'st the clank of iron rings; Look down as in a vision, and behold Full many sherds of the fresh-fallen year Sprent on the floor of Heaven. Therefore this Is a new link of imperfection gone— The chain whereby each spirit like a gem Swings in the vast, whose topmost loops do cling About the roots of Eden, with this hour Contracts again: so, with each patient term More buoyant thro' this atmosphere of Time We rise toward the holy and the pure Eternity, which is the Home of God. WORK AND REST. ‘Yea, blessed is the silence of the dead: Cool on their breasts all deep rich mosses lie— A more than music in the stillness lives About their graves—O Father, let us die!’ Brothers, the day of action is not past— Not yet the sunset sweetness doth appear, Nor, steep'd in luscious balms, comes up the wind The plump full-fruited autumn of the year: There is a work before us in our prime— To stretch our lives out to the widest girth Of circumstance,—to be as much as God And our own souls can make us; from the Earth To drain her lavish largess of delights And quiet wisdoms, reverently; to brood Over our day with large impartial eyes, And mark the shining evil from the good; To woo both Past and Present and To-come, Nor wholly cleave to either; to discern Which be the true immortals of the age— The massive beauties, that with every turn And wrench of Fashion in the loamy deeps Of Truth are rooted firmer,—and for these To battle bravely, clearing them a range Of fairer breadth, that they may grow in peace; To work the hearts of others, and our own, Thro' bracing doubts (when doubts are haply rife) To faith; and bid for weary souls and poor Fair eyotts blossom on the surge of Life; To make the tender women of our love Be more of Woman—more sincere, more wise To hate convention, looking into life With deeper, yet with modest household eyes; To help the training of all bright-hair'd boys So late our fellows,—help to disenthrall From oozy sloughs the footsteps of the child, And lift the star of knowledge over all. Shall we not work, O brothers, in our youth? Shall we not march into the heats of June Erect and self-commanding,—seeking not For cool siestas in an English noon? ‘Yea, but there is no peace! In calmest dells— By moss-lipp'd brooks—'mid quiet flowers and ferns— Beneath old solemn elms—by yon rich marsh Where stand at eve the grey majestic herns— In the most utter secrets of the land, Where every glance around us doth disclose A brotherhood of beauties all devote To ministrations holy of repose— E'en here, ere yet our spent knees have sunk down In fragrant cushions, comes a sudden whirr Uncouth and horrid, which in the chill'd air And our wan hearts maketh most piteous stir; And that blind Titan, whose impetuous life Breeds half the strength and grandeur of the age, Sweeps shuddering by, and thunders thro' our hearts All, all the storms we panted to assuage!’ Alas, I know it—how can I reprove? Yet is it well, methinks, that even thus, In the deep hallow'd centre of our joy, Such stern remembrance should flash over us Of what and where we are,—and that to nurse Our own scant beings only, is a crime; That toil and passion cease not in the world— We may not flee, nor rest before our time. Yet mourn not: take it for a truth divine— The husk reveals not what the kernels are; Calm pensive Thought is cloister'd in a crowd, And Music dies not in the rout of war. Think, when alone the shivering landscape shows A clotted wreck of roots and sodden leaves, How soft and still those whitest purest snows Fall fresh from heaven on the soil'd dark eaves: When the chief surge has burst in crashing foam, How sweet, while smooth the hissing flood withdraws And the spent wave slides simmering down the shore, The stillness of that momentary pause: Deep in cleft hollows of the stormy drifts How dear for Love amid her frozen hours To find some nested verdure underneath, And thick with broods of meek white-blossom'd flowers! Think on these things—for, brother, so shalt thou Pass from the troubled into the serene: And be not bitter toward the days that are, Nor ask impatient what these struggles mean: For thus, within the furious clashing clouds, She keeps her quiet light, thy future moon; And thus, beyond the roaring reefs of Life There sleeps for thee an inner calm lagoon; And thus, when thou art chafed and worn, shall Death— Calm mother of the persecuted brave— Ope her white lips and suck thee sweetly down Into the hopeful silence of the grave. COMMUNION. It is not good to be alone— The very closest heart At moments grieves, as one by one Its selfish joys depart: Like shrunk sea-flowers that pine and crave, Slow withering on the strand, Once more within some kindred wave To freshen and expand, So yearns the moodiest of us all, And strangest to his kind, For some sweet fellowship to call Her secrets from his mind. But what strong influence shall absorb Thy quick magnetic soul, Or where the lost imperfect orb That spheres thee to a whole? Communion with our God is good— Yea, excellent indeed; Nurse of high faith and brotherhood And a large loving creed: Yet even hence the spirit sinks Down to her proper state; And well—for fast our Father links The creature to his mate; And thou with private Heavens afar Kept sleek from present dearth, Ask for thy home some desert star, And leave to us our Earth. Communion with thine own strange soul? Ah, wonderful and wild The storms that fretful Past can roll On thee, her alter'd child! 'Tis well within thy heart's lone tarn, O pensive mountaineer, To search for truths that teach and warn, That comfort, and that cheer: For thus self-knowledge shoots and grows; Thus thro' all leafy din Unruffled sits the central rose; Thus shalt thou find within, What time elastic friendship ends And the full sorrows come, A band of counsellors and friends, A calm consoling home; Thus, sloping from the great and whole To the weak little ones, Shall the thick beauties of thy soul Encircle thee like sons; And if no loving lips may share Thy wormwood and thy gall, Yet shall no strange and serpent-stare Thine inner joys appal. Yes; but not he of fewest needs Doth in himself comprise The love whereon his fancy feeds, The lore that makes him wise; Nor e'en to fairest maiden, fraught With many pearls of price, The silent music of her thought Can utterly suffice. Communion with the lore of books— Rich birds melodious Who, building in another's nooks, Are caught and caged for us? We love their grand generic truths And large philosophies,— We sift and glean, most patient Ruths, Their wisdom as it lies; Old aspirations of the mind— Familiar wants and large— All that is common to our kind— Such friends may hold in charge; But these are little of each whole: The quick, the ever new, The secret yearnings of the soul,— What shall such wanderers do? Then they are strange, the souls that move Thro' each nutritious line; I look'd not on their face with love, Nor they with love on mine: Yea, tho' their thoughts should on me fall Like music on the sea, There runs a discord thro' them all— They were not meant for me. Communion with thy mother's eyes— With Nature? Surely she Among her thousand sympathies Hath one caress for thee! Behold, in all thy varied moods, In passion and in grief, She sets her answering attitudes Of comfort and relief: She is a ripe vine-cluster, rich With fat delicious ooze; A bending bulb of juices, which All thirsty lips may bruise. Old shaggy gnarls the lichen frets— Steep banks of mountain lanes— Moss-cushion'd arms of rivulets— The hush of woodland rains— Faint sighs of rushes in the fens— Faint lispings of the tide— Faint splashes down the gloomy glens Of waters undescried— Thin throbbing films of mellow light Wide-woven in the west, And cool star-crystals, which the Night Breeds on her purple breast— Long bars of creeping cloud, and sheets Of wild electric flame— And all the unregarded sweets That melt in Nature's name,— Behold, they are not only fair; Each in its fruitful barm Hath truths and wisdoms everywhere, To comfort, and to charm.— Yea, Nature is a tender nurse, And speaks a soothing speech To all—but can she too disperse A special love to each? Can she a mother's bosom bare To each fond milking mouth, And tend with conscious human care Each spirit in its growth? No: for she lacks one crowning grace— The sympathy of kind: Hers is a sweet suggestive face, Loving and fair, but—blind! Then is there nought thy soul can trust— No friendship it may know— No touch to thaw its gelid crust And let the fulness flow?— There is an only fellowship To which the soul replies Instinctive as the quivering lip Unto the melting eyes: Its voice is like his mother-tongue Within an exile's ears; Perhaps he half forgets the song, But all his spirit hears: ‘Its voice is very sweet and low,’ Our longing manhood cries: ‘'Tis bold and deep as torrents' flow,’ Expectant Woman sighs. Ask but its name, and there shall roll Unnumber'd wailings by— ‘Communion with a human soul: O grant it, 'ere we die!’ MAGDALEN. Speak to her heart, my brother! Take no thought Of this vain show of lying circumstance That makes her presence hateful: underneath I know there is a heart—my very lips Suck'd thro' the tainted rind its sweetness out What time I led her by those moonlit elms And spake of innocence. Her fallen eyes Are glazed with gladness; but beneath, how far The dense accumulations of despair Do writhe and darken! Yet she shall not die: How could we lift against a woman's gaze The fulness of our own, or think it pride To wear the front of men, unless some slow And delicate work did struggle to atone The madness of our fellows? Chiefly thou, Favour'd of place and blessedly exempt From odious stains of false opinion,—thou, Fenced with the sombre magic of the priest, Shalt do what others dare not. Thou hast leave To minister in peace; therefore approach— Most pure of purpose, saintliest in act— The self-despising slave, and sweeping off Those thin delusive gawds and each false clue That proffers to thy search and would decoy Thy spirit from the truth, do thou—like Him Whose potent finger wither'd up the loins That else had grace to conquer—feel at once Straight to the core, and cushion thy soft touch On the young nerve whose keen vitality Lives all unsear'd within her. O the chasm That instant cleaves her ragged rottenness Of life, and fierce burns blasting to the roots Of her scarr'd nature! Most unconsciously Thro' that great fissure thou shalt enter in, And o'er the blighted Eden of her soul Move like a spring—soon, soon, drench'd deep and long With sudden rains of penitential tears Loosed sobbing from their source: till, in the cool Of her wild day of sinning, shall be heard Among reviving thickets of green palms Immortal footsteps—and anon, with shame Lifting her meek wet eyelids, she beholds The calm forgiving presence of her God. EPILOGUE. Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thine, Brother which movest thus from page to page Thy keen clear eyes in pleasure or in blame? Thou art not dabbled with the old deceits Concerning Genius; thou wouldst never dare Lay a cold finger on the lips of Thought, Unless she spake of sin,—or bitterly E'en the youngest minstrel and most mean Stamp the mail'd foot of pride. There were who held Parnassus slopes not, but is steep and smooth Like a storm-riven spar; that whom the top Receives not in imperishable heavens, Must wallow at the roots—in foolish slime Sputtering their lives away, or grovelling In odious filth of imitative rage And adulation of those supreme bards Unspeakably above. But are there not Slow gentle grades among the sons of song As in the men of action? There are some,— Great prophet-chiefs, girt with nobility And wisdom as a robe,—ambassadors Sent forth to preach of excellence and God To the total world—whose full impassion'd eyes Blaze thro' a stormy cataract of hair Like suns behind a shower—whose ardent lips Part round their uttering music like warm clouds About those suns at eve—whose master-souls Stand like huge organs in the vaulted aisles Of this cathedral-world, and royally Roll their rich anthems to the rumbling roofs And shake the carven columns into awe: These are most catholic; each stammering soul And hoarse gives heed to them, and joys to hear The mute chaotic meaning of its thought Sublimely shaped in words. As down the slope Of that huge crag the broad black fathomless bulk Of waters rolls stupendous, and anon Over the horrid edge a fretful dome Of boiling billows shoots amazed and booms Down thro' the far dim gulfs of shuddering mist A shock of solid thunder,—with such voice They to the Earth appeal, and all the Earth Gives answer; and how much of Heaven besides We know not yet: they thro' their several age Bursting, like manhood thro' the garb of youth, Do make the plastic Future populous With likeness of themselves; nor only fill With their sweet floods the narrow gorge of Time, But haply brim its jealous lips and sweep Expansive floods adventurous o'er the fields And broad savannahs of Eternity. And there are some whose lesser spirits meek Hang like lone harps among the groves of Thought, Untended and untuned; whose flaccid chords— Or bristled with a rime of frozen tears, Or moist with vernal juices—the vague winds Usurp at moments, and fro' the clotted strings Clash out some shrill imperfect utterance Of gusty music. Not without a use, If yet unselfish, these sequester'd bards Unknown to splendid influence and to fame: Not unevoked of that one Providence Who slopes the ascent of things, their inner sweets Soak thro' the thin crust of the soul, and melt In dews upon the surface; for behold, Born like instinctive frosts along the sway'd And rustling mere, their starry flakes arise, Each in his unknown origin apart, And freeze and strengthen thro' the long blue night More thickly and more near, until they fuse And sheet the smooth'd circumference of Life With beauty and with good. If in that film And galaxy of sheeny points, obscure And sombre when alone, thou think of me As most minute, I pray thee from the halls Of thy shut soul come forth to meet my words With looks of brotherhood; nor take it ill If in the ardent morning of this life The shadow of my spirit reach to thee. I have no friend nor counsellor—I stand Alone amid the crude results of thought, And know not where to turn: but this I know— If it have aught of pardon or excuse To be of earnest purpose and sincere— With Pythian voice to utter out the things We feel and know; if, just about to be, The young perplexities of Being seem A tale for others' ears: if it be well The brotherly communicative Man Should love his country and his age, and strive To scent the air about him—strive to keep Unsoil'd, unshred, the blessed flower-cup That makes a casket for the mourner's tears, The paradise of comfort unto which All human hearts do yearn, all intellects Unclouded soar and seek to as a bourne— The glory of the Bible; if to tell How fond a Father to the childlike Earth, How grand and lovely is the God of grace: If there be aught of excellent desire Or old ennobling chivalry of aim In this, thou wilt not mock me nor despise. For I am but as thou art, being young— A nude and vagrant soul, whereon the grasp Of vigilant Life hath scarcely laid as yet Her prison-garments; hath not laced her up In prejudice of place, or galling coil Of prim Convention; nor hath graced with strength And concentration, which all special ways Give to the men that walk them: a crude soul, That could not stand beneath the beetling Past, Nor watch the wondrous doings of To-day, Nor hear the thunder of the workmen's tools Developing the Future, without keen And glowing eyes, and something like a wish To let the little pitcher from her arm And give to drink, if any at his work Do choose to sip refreshment such as this. Behold, the time is short—the failing stars Move but a little way before they die Into the blazing hours of the dawn: We are not poets long; the stubborn thews And sinewy muscles of the perfect man Begin to thicken thro' our frame, and weave Under the changed complexion of fresh youth A knotted web of tough and brawny strength Thro' all our supple limbs: so let us speak Before the clear soprano of our voice Breaks into bass, and buoyant Poesy Is merged and kneaded with the coarser stuff That feeds us in our struggle thro' the world. Take then, O brother! with a brother's heart The little flowers I give: and if for thee They bear a worth—if ever to thine eyes They bring the smile that hails a kindred thought Or chronicles a new, O leave them not Without a meed of blessing or of prayer For me, which from the spirit of the just Availeth much: And thou, strange sister-soul,— Woman unknown—if thou at all from me Dost learn to shut the odorous doors of self About thee, musing in that paradise Of thy high nature, and the prophecies That went before on thee, and what large dues Do lie upon thy glorious Womanhood, And by what workings thou shalt best become A mated help for Man,—if this be so, Gather my cluster'd thoughts, and take them up Like fruit between thine argent fingers moist, And drop them thro' sweet juicy lips, to melt (Holpen of thine appreciative sense And fertile spirit) thro' thy healthful being And texture of thy daily life, and be A homely wisdom to thee, and a joy. So from afar should I in venturous thought See small effects, and beautiful as small, Even from these rude lays; and dignify My life by hope, with blind inquiring touch Fingering the faces of all unknown friends: So may for you all highest excellence Of knowledge—all imaginative joys— All household bliss—all pure intelligent love, Woman's or man's, which is most heavenly Being most human—all desires that cling To Nature's breast as to a mother's—all True hallow'd faith, all boundless charity And strong resolves to weed the stifled world Of sins and sorrows—yea, all inner grace And holiest boons and benisons of God, Be with your souls for evermore—Farewell! 1851–52. ????? ??? ??????.
